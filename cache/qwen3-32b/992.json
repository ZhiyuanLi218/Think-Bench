These types of precipitates are better handled using gravity filtration with a coarser filter or by allowing them to settle before filtration. Therefore, **this statement is incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n**Option B: \"In case of a fire involving laboratory electrical equipment, a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher can be used to extinguish the fire.\"**\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO₂) fire extinguishers are specifically designed for electrical fires because CO₂ is non-conductive and does not leave a residue that could damage sensitive equipment. It is a standard and safe method to use in such situations. Thus, **this statement is correct**.\n\n---\n\n**Option C: \"In the preparation of ammonium ferrous sulfate crystals, the solution containing FeSO₄ and (NH₄)₂SO₄ must be concentrated to dryness.\"**\n\nAmmonium ferrous sulfate is a double salt that typically contains water of crystallization. Evaporating the solution to dryness would likely remove this essential water and cause the salt to decompose or lose its structural integrity. Instead, the solution is usually concentrated to a point where the crystals form upon cooling. Therefore, **this statement is incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n**Option D: \"Large crystals can be obtained by quickly cooling a hot KNO₃ saturated solution in ice water.\"**\n\nCrystal size is inversely related to the rate of cooling. Rapid cooling (e.g., in ice water) leads to the formation of **small, numerous crystals**, as the solute precipitates quickly. In contrast, slow cooling allows solute molecules to arrange themselves into larger, more ordered crystal structures. Hence, **this statement is incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong all the options, only **Option B** correctly reflects established laboratory safety and chemical practice.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the question is about which statement is correct among the four options given. Each option relates to a different laboratory technique or procedure. I need to recall what I know about each of these topics to figure out the right answer.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Vacuum filtration is suitable for filtering colloidal hydroxide precipitates.\" Hmm. I remember that vacuum filtration, also known as suction filtration, uses a Buchner funnel and a vacuum to speed up the filtration process. But colloidal precipitates are usually very fine particles that can clog the filter paper. For example, when you have a colloidal precipitate like ferric hydroxide, it's often better to use a different method, maybe gravity filtration with a larger pore size filter paper or even to let it settle first. So maybe A is incorrect because colloidal precipitates aren't good for vacuum filtration as they might block the filter.\n\nMoving to option B: \"In case of a fire involving laboratory electrical equipment, a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher can be used to extinguish the fire.\" I know that for electrical fires, you need a fire extinguisher that doesn't conduct electricity. Carbon dioxide extinguishers are recommended because they discharge CO2 gas, which is non-conductive and doesn't leave residue. So B sounds correct. However, I should check if there are any exceptions. For example, some sources say that CO2 might not be as effective for certain types of electrical fires, but generally, it's considered safe and appropriate. So B might be the correct answer.\n\nOption C: \"In the preparation of ammonium ferrous sulfate crystals, the solution containing FeSO4 and (NH4)2SO4 must be concentrated to dryness.\" Ammonium ferrous sulfate is a double salt, and when preparing it, you usually mix the two solutions and then evaporate the water to get crystals. But concentrating to dryness might cause decomposition or lose the water of crystallization. Typically, you heat the solution until a small amount of solid forms upon cooling, not to complete dryness. So C is probably incorrect because you don't want to evaporate all the water; you need some for the crystal structure.\n\nOption D: \"Large crystals can be obtained by quickly cooling a hot KNO3 saturated solution in ice water.\" From what I remember, crystal size depends on the rate of cooling. Rapid cooling usually leads to smaller crystals because the solute precipitates quickly without much time to form large structures. Conversely, slow cooling allows for larger crystals as the solute has more time to arrange into a lattice. So if you cool in ice water quickly, you'd get small crystals, not large ones. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nSo summarizing:\nA: Incorrect (colloidal precipitates clog the filter)\nB: Correct (CO2 extinguisher for electrical fires)\nC: Incorrect (shouldn't concentrate to dryness)\nD: Incorrect (rapid cooling gives small crystals)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n</think>"}
