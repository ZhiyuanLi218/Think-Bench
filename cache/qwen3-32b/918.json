The problem says:\n\nGiven that sin x / sin y = 3 and cos x / cos y = 1/2, find the value of (sin 2x / sin 2y) + (cos 2x / cos 2y), expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.\n\nAlright, let's start by writing down the given information:\n\n1. sin x / sin y = 3\n2. cos x / cos y = 1/2\n\nWe need to find (sin 2x / sin 2y) + (cos 2x / cos 2y).\n\nFirst, I recall that sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ and cos 2θ can be expressed in multiple forms, like cos²θ - sin²θ, 2cos²θ - 1, or 1 - 2sin²θ. Maybe these identities will help.\n\nLet me first compute sin 2x / sin 2y. Since sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x and sin 2y = 2 sin y cos y, their ratio would be (2 sin x cos x) / (2 sin y cos y) = (sin x / sin y) * (cos x / cos y). From the given, sin x / sin y = 3 and cos x / cos y = 1/2, so multiplying them gives 3 * 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, sin 2x / sin 2y = 3/2.\n\nOkay, that part seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the second term: cos 2x / cos 2y. Hmm, I need to find expressions for cos 2x and cos 2y.\n\nBut I don't know the exact values of sin x, sin y, cos x, or cos y. Maybe I can express cos 2x and cos 2y in terms of sin x, sin y, cos x, cos y, and then use the given ratios?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find relations between sin x and sin y, cos x and cos y. Let me denote sin x = 3 sin y and cos x = (1/2) cos y. Wait, is that correct? The given ratios are sin x / sin y = 3 and cos x / cos y = 1/2. So yes, sin x = 3 sin y and cos x = (1/2) cos y.\n\nBut then, since sin²x + cos²x = 1, we can substitute these expressions into the Pythagorean identity.\n\nSo let's do that. Let me write:\n\nsin x = 3 sin y => sin²x = 9 sin²y\n\ncos x = (1/2) cos y => cos²x = (1/4) cos²y\n\nTherefore, sin²x + cos²x = 9 sin²y + (1/4) cos²y = 1.\n\nSo, 9 sin²y + (1/4) cos²y = 1. Let me write this equation:\n\n9 sin²y + (1/4) cos²y = 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express everything in terms of sin²y or cos²y. Let me note that sin²y = 1 - cos²y. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\n9(1 - cos²y) + (1/4) cos²y = 1\n\nExpanding:\n\n9 - 9 cos²y + (1/4) cos²y = 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n9 - (9 - 1/4) cos²y = 1 => 9 - (35/4) cos²y = 1\n\nThen, subtract 9 from both sides:\n\n- (35/4) cos²y = 1 - 9 => - (35/4) cos²y = -8\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n(35/4) cos²y = 8\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n35 cos²y = 32\n\nTherefore, cos²y = 32 / 35\n\nThen, sin²y = 1 - cos²y = 1 - 32/35 = 3/35\n\nSo sin²y = 3/35 and cos²y = 32/35. Therefore, sin y = ±√(3/35) and cos y = ±√(32/35). However, since x and y are real numbers, we need to consider the signs. But since the problem doesn't specify the quadrants where x and y lie, perhaps we can proceed with the squares and find relations accordingly.\n\nBut maybe we need more information about the signs? Let me think. However, since we are dealing with ratios and then expressions involving sin 2x, sin 2y, cos 2x, cos 2y, which depend on the products of sine and cosine. The signs might affect the results, but perhaps they will cancel out? Or maybe we can find relations regardless of the signs?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find sin 2y and cos 2y? Let me try.\n\nFirst, let me note that sin 2y = 2 sin y cos y. Similarly for sin 2x. But we already found sin 2x / sin 2y = 3/2 earlier.\n\nBut for cos 2x / cos 2y, we need expressions for cos 2x and cos 2y. Let me recall that cos 2θ = 2cos²θ - 1 or 1 - 2 sin²θ. Let me compute cos 2x and cos 2y.\n\nFirst, let's compute cos 2y. Using cos 2y = 2 cos²y - 1. We know cos²y = 32/35, so:\n\ncos 2y = 2*(32/35) - 1 = 64/35 - 1 = 64/35 - 35/35 = 29/35.\n\nSimilarly, cos 2x can be computed. Let's find cos 2x. Let's use the identity cos 2x = 2 cos²x - 1. But we can find cos²x from earlier. Earlier, we had cos x = (1/2) cos y, so cos²x = (1/4) cos²y = (1/4)*(32/35) = 8/35.\n\nTherefore, cos 2x = 2*(8/35) - 1 = 16/35 - 1 = 16/35 - 35/35 = -19/35.\n\nTherefore, cos 2x / cos 2y = (-19/35) / (29/35) = -19/29.\n\nTherefore, the value we need is sin 2x / sin 2y + cos 2x / cos 2y = 3/2 + (-19/29) = 3/2 - 19/29.\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 29, which are coprime, so LCD is 58.\n\nConvert 3/2 to 87/58 (since 3*29=87 and 2*29=58).\n\nConvert 19/29 to 38/58 (since 19*2=38 and 29*2=58).\n\nTherefore, 87/58 - 38/58 = (87 - 38)/58 = 49/58.\n\nSo the value is 49/58. Check if 49 and 58 are coprime. 49 factors are 7^2, 58 factors are 2*29. No common factors, so yes, 49/58 is reduced. Therefore, p = 49, q = 58, so p + q = 107.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, starting with sin x / sin y = 3 => sin x = 3 sin y.\n\nSimilarly, cos x / cos y = 1/2 => cos x = (1/2) cos y.\n\nThen, using sin²x + cos²x = 1:\n\n(9 sin²y) + (1/4 cos²y) = 1. Then substituting sin²y = 1 - cos²y:\n\n9(1 - cos²y) + (1/4) cos²y = 1 => 9 - 9 cos²y + (1/4) cos²y = 1 => 9 - (35/4) cos²y = 1 => -(35/4) cos²y = -8 => cos²y = 32/35. That seems correct.\n\nThen sin²y = 3/35. Then cos 2y = 2*(32/35) - 1 = 64/35 - 35/35 = 29/35. Correct.\n\ncos²x = (1/4)*cos²y = 8/35. Therefore, cos 2x = 2*(8/35) - 1 = 16/35 - 35/35 = -19/35. Correct.\n\nTherefore, cos 2x / cos 2y = (-19/35)/(29/35) = -19/29. Correct.\n\nEarlier, sin 2x / sin 2y was 3/2. Then total expression is 3/2 - 19/29. Let me verify that calculation again.\n\nConvert 3/2 to 87/58: 3*29 = 87, yes. 19/29 is 38/58. So 87 - 38 = 49. 49/58. Yes. And 49 and 58 have no common factors. 58 divided by 2 is 29, which is prime. 49 is 7 squared. No overlap. So yes, reduced fraction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 49 + 58 = 107.\n\nBut just to make sure there isn't a mistake in assuming the signs. For example, if cos y is negative, then cos x would be (1/2) cos y, which would also be negative. Similarly, sin y could be positive or negative, but sin x is 3 sin y, so same sign. However, when we compute sin 2x / sin 2y, that ratio is (sin x / sin y)*(cos x / cos y) regardless of the signs, because if sin y and cos y are negative, their product would have a negative sign, but since both sin x and cos x are scaled by the same sign (since sin x = 3 sin y and cos x = 1/2 cos y), the ratio remains positive 3/2. Similarly, for cos 2x and cos 2y, since they depend on squares, the sign of cos 2x and cos 2y would depend on the angle, but since we calculated them via the identities, which don't depend on the sign of cos y or sin y, just their squares. Therefore, our calculation is okay regardless of the actual signs.\n\nTherefore, I think 49/58 is correct, so p + q is 107.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{107}\n</think>"}
