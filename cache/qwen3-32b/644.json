The user is asking about which experiment, phenomenon, and conclusion are correct according to the experimental purpose. The options are A, B, C, or D. But wait, the user didn't provide the actual details of the experiments or the options. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the specific experiments, phenomena, or conclusions for each option, I can't really determine the correct answer.\n\nI need to ask the user to provide more information. Maybe they forgot to include the details of each option. Let me check the original question again. The user wrote \"According to the experimental purpose, which of the following experiments, phenomena, and conclusions are correct?\" followed by options A to D. But there's no description of what each option entails. \n\nWithout the specific experiments and their corresponding phenomena and conclusions, I can't analyze which one is correct. It's possible that the user intended to include that information but it didn't come through. I should prompt them to provide the details for each option so I can help properly. Yeah, that's the way to go. I can't proceed without the necessary data.\n</think>"}
