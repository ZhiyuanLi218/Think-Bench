Right now, the geostationary orbit radius is 6.6 times Earth's radius, but if Earth spins faster (shorter rotation period), the geostationary orbit radius would change. The question is asking for the minimum rotation period where three satellites can still cover the equator. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a geostationary satellite is. It's a satellite that orbits the Earth at the same rotational speed as the Earth itself, so it remains fixed relative to a point on the Earth's surface. This requires that the satellite's orbital period matches the Earth's rotation period. The current geostationary orbit radius is given as 6.6 times Earth's radius. \n\nNow, if Earth's rotation period decreases, the geostationary orbit radius must also decrease. Because the orbital period depends on the radius via Kepler's third law. The formula for the orbital period is T² = (4π²/GM) * r³. So if T decreases, r must decrease as well. \n\nBut the problem is about coverage. Three satellites need to cover the entire equator. The coverage area of a satellite depends on the angle from the center of the Earth. The satellites are positioned in such a way that their coverage areas overlap sufficiently to cover the entire equator. \n\nSo, if the satellites are closer to Earth (because T is smaller), their coverage area would be smaller. Wait, no. Wait, if they are closer, their signal can cover a smaller angular distance on the Earth's surface. Because the higher the satellite, the larger the area it can cover. So if the geostationary satellites are lower (smaller radius), their coverage area is smaller. Therefore, to cover the equator with three satellites, the angular distance between adjacent satellites must be such that their coverage angles add up to cover 360 degrees. \n\nLet me think. For three satellites to cover the equator, each satellite must cover an arc of 120 degrees. But actually, since they need to overlap, maybe each satellite's coverage needs to span more than 120 degrees. Wait, if three satellites are spaced equally, each would be 120 degrees apart. For their coverage to overlap sufficiently, the angular coverage of each satellite must be at least 120 degrees. Wait, no. If each satellite can cover an arc of θ degrees, then three satellites spaced 120 degrees apart would need that θ + θ > 120 degrees? Wait, maybe I need to think geometrically.\n\nImagine the Earth as a circle. A satellite in geostationary orbit is at a certain height. The coverage area on Earth is a circle. The angular radius of that coverage area depends on the satellite's altitude. The maximum angle from the satellite's position where a ground station can communicate with it is determined by the line of sight. \n\nSo, if the satellite is at radius r (from Earth's center), and Earth's radius is R, then the angle θ from the satellite to the edge of coverage is given by the right triangle formed by the satellite, the center of the Earth, and the point on Earth's surface where the signal just reaches. \n\nUsing trigonometry: cosθ = R / r. So θ = arccos(R / r). The angular radius of coverage is θ. Therefore, the total angular span covered by one satellite is 2θ. \n\nFor three satellites to cover the equator, the angular coverage of each satellite must be such that when spaced 120 degrees apart, there's no gap. So, the angular coverage of each satellite must be at least 120 degrees. Wait, if the satellite covers 2θ, then 2θ must be >= 120 degrees. Therefore, θ >= 60 degrees. \n\nSo, arccos(R / r) >= 60 degrees. Therefore, cos(arccos(R / r)) <= cos(60°) => R / r <= 0.5 => r >= 2R. \n\nWait, but currently, the geostationary radius is 6.6 R. So if we want r to be as small as possible (so that the Earth's rotation period is as small as possible), but still have r >= 2R. Therefore, the minimum r is 2R. \n\nTherefore, if we can find the rotation period corresponding to a geostationary orbit at r = 2R, then that would be the minimum rotation period. \n\nSo, using Kepler's third law. The current geostationary orbit is at r₁ = 6.6 R, with period T₁ = 24 hours. \n\nWe need to find T₂ when r₂ = 2R. \n\nKepler's third law states that T² ∝ r³. \n\nTherefore, T₂ / T₁ = (r₂ / r₁)^(3/2). \n\nBut wait, actually, for Earth's own rotation, the geostationary period must equal the rotation period. So if we want a geostationary orbit at radius r, the period T must satisfy T² = (4π²/GM) r³. \n\nBut since we have two different scenarios (current and desired), we can take the ratio. \n\nLet me write:\n\nT₁² / T₂² = (r₁³ / r₂³)\n\nTherefore, T₂ = T₁ * (r₂ / r₁)^(3/2)\n\nBut wait, we need to be careful. The current T₁ is 24 hours for r₁ = 6.6 R. But if we want a geostationary orbit at r₂ = 2 R, then T₂ would be the rotation period of Earth. \n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\nT₂ = 24 h * (2 R / 6.6 R)^(3/2) = 24 * (2 / 6.6)^(3/2)\n\nCalculate 2 / 6.6 ≈ 0.303\n\nThen (0.303)^(3/2). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, square root of 0.303 is approx sqrt(0.303) ≈ 0.55. Then multiply by 0.303: 0.303 * 0.55 ≈ 0.16665. \n\nSo T₂ ≈ 24 * 0.16665 ≈ 4 hours. \n\nSo approximately 4 hours. Which is option B. \n\nBut let me check my steps again. \n\nFirst, the angular coverage. The satellite's coverage angle. \n\nIf the satellite is at distance r from Earth's center, then the angle θ from the satellite to the edge of coverage is given by cosθ = R / r. So θ = arccos(R / r). \n\nSo the total coverage is 2θ. For three satellites spaced 120 degrees apart, the coverage of each satellite must reach 60 degrees on either side of the satellite's position. So that adjacent satellites' coverage overlaps at the 120 degree spacing. Therefore, 2θ >= 120 degrees => θ >= 60 degrees. \n\nTherefore, arccos(R / r) >= 60 degrees. \n\nTaking cosine of both sides (since cos is decreasing in [0, 180]), we get R / r <= cos(60°) = 0.5. Therefore, r >= 2 R. \n\nSo the minimum r is 2 R. \n\nTherefore, using Kepler's law, the period for a satellite at 2 R. \n\nCurrent geostationary satellite: T₁ = 24 h, r₁ = 6.6 R. \n\nWe can use Kepler's third law. For Earth, the proportionality constant in T² = (4π² / GM) r³ is determined by Earth's mass. However, since we have two cases, we can take the ratio. \n\nT₂² / T₁² = (r₂³ / r₁³)\n\nTherefore, T₂ = T₁ * (r₂ / r₁)^(3/2) \n\nSo plugging numbers:\n\nr₂ = 2 R, r₁ = 6.6 R. \n\nSo ratio r₂ / r₁ = 2 / 6.6 ≈ 0.303 \n\n(0.303)^(3/2) = (0.303)^1 * (0.303)^0.5 ≈ 0.303 * 0.55 ≈ 0.1666 \n\nTherefore, T₂ ≈ 24 * 0.1666 ≈ 4 hours. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B, 4 hours. \n\nBut let me check if my assumption about the coverage is correct. \n\nSuppose three satellites spaced 120 degrees apart. Each satellite needs to cover 120 degrees of the equator. But the coverage is a circle around the satellite's position. The angular radius of that circle is θ, so that the satellite can communicate with points on Earth up to θ degrees away from the sub-satellite point. \n\nTo cover the equator with three satellites, the angular distance between adjacent satellites (120 degrees) must be less than or equal to 2θ. Wait, no. If the satellites are spaced 120 degrees apart, then the midpoint between two satellites is 60 degrees away from each satellite. Therefore, to ensure that there is no gap, the coverage of each satellite must reach at least 60 degrees from its position. Therefore, θ must be at least 60 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the angular radius θ is 60 degrees. Hence, arccos(R / r) = 60 degrees. Therefore, R / r = cos(60°) = 0.5 => r = 2 R. \n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, my calculation seems right. \n\nBut let me verify with actual numbers. Suppose r = 2 R. Let me compute θ. \n\ncosθ = R / (2R) = 0.5 => θ = 60 degrees. So the satellite can cover from 60 degrees to the left to 60 degrees to the right, which is 120 degrees. Therefore, with three satellites spaced 120 degrees apart, their coverage would just meet at the edges. So there's no gap. \n\nTherefore, that's the minimum. If Earth's rotation period is such that geostationary orbit is at 2 R, then three satellites can just cover the equator. If Earth's rotation period is shorter, then geostationary orbit would be closer than 2 R, which would mean θ < 60 degrees, and the coverage would not reach across the 60 degrees between satellite midpoints. Therefore, three satellites would not suffice. \n\nTherefore, the minimum period is when r = 2 R. \n\nSo the calculation gives approximately 4 hours. \n\nBut let me recalculate the exact value. \n\nr₁ = 6.6 R, T₁ = 24 h. \n\nr₂ = 2 R. \n\nT₂ = T₁ * (r₂ / r₁)^(3/2) \n\nCompute (2 / 6.6)^(3/2). \n\nFirst, simplify 2 / 6.6. \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10: 20 / 66 = 10 / 33 ≈ 0.3030. \n\nSo, let me compute (10/33)^(3/2). \n\nTake natural logarithm: ln( (10/33)^(3/2) ) = (3/2) * ln(10/33) ≈ (1.5) * ln(0.303) \n\nCalculate ln(0.303) ≈ -1.195 \n\nMultiply by 1.5: -1.7925 \n\nExponentiate: e^(-1.7925) ≈ 0.166. \n\nSo 0.166 * 24 h ≈ 3.98 hours ≈ 4 hours. \n\nYes, so answer is B. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if Kepler's law is applicable here. Kepler's law is for orbits around Earth, so yes. The geostationary period must satisfy Kepler's third law. \n\nAnother way: Let's recall that the current geostationary orbit is about 35,786 km above Earth's surface. Earth's radius is about 6,371 km. So the orbital radius is about 42,157 km, which is roughly 6.6 times Earth's radius (42,157 / 6,371 ≈ 6.61). \n\nIf we want the orbital radius to be 2 R, then altitude would be R, so 6,371 km altitude. But that's much lower. However, regardless of the actual numbers, using the ratio is sufficient. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B) 4 hours. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
