The question is asking which of the options is correct for the simplest alkene. The options are A through D. First, I need to recall what an alkene is. Alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The simplest alkene would be the one with the fewest carbon atoms possible.\n\nSo, the simplest alkene is ethene, right? Ethene has two carbon atoms connected by a double bond and each carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The structure is CH₂=CH₂. Now, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says \"at least two pi bonds.\" A double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. Since ethene has one double bond, that would be one sigma and one pi bond. So, ethene has only one pi bond. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it states at least two pi bonds, but there's only one.\n\nOption B: \"at least four sigma bonds.\" Let's count the sigma bonds in ethene. Each single bond is a sigma bond. In ethene, each carbon is bonded to two hydrogens with single bonds and they share a double bond with each other. The double bond is one sigma and one pi. So, each carbon has two C-H sigma bonds and one C-C sigma bond. For two carbons, that's 2 (from each carbon) times 2 (for two carbons) for the hydrogens? Wait, no. Let me recount. Each carbon in ethene is bonded to two hydrogens. So each carbon has two C-H sigma bonds and one C-C sigma bond. So total sigma bonds: 2 (from one carbon's C-H bonds) + 2 (from the other carbon's C-H bonds) + 1 (C-C sigma bond) = 5 sigma bonds. Wait, that's five. So option B says \"at least four sigma bonds,\" which is true because there are five. So B is correct? Hmm. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Each carbon in ethene has two hydrogens. So two hydrogens per carbon, each with a sigma bond. So two per carbon, two carbons: 2*2=4 C-H sigma bonds. Plus one C-C sigma bond. Total of 5 sigma bonds. So yes, ethene has five sigma bonds. So option B says \"at least four sigma bonds,\" which is true. So B is correct. But wait, let me check the options again. The question is about the simplest alkene. Ethene is the simplest. So if B is correct, then maybe that's the answer. But let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption C: \"a tetrahedral configuration.\" Wait, the geometry around each carbon in ethene is trigonal planar, right? Because each carbon is bonded to three atoms (two hydrogens and one other carbon) and has a double bond. The hybridization is sp², leading to a trigonal planar geometry with bond angles of about 120 degrees. A tetrahedral configuration would be sp³ hybridization, like in alkanes. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"cis-trans isomers.\" For cis-trans isomerism (geometric isomerism) to occur, there must be different groups on each carbon of the double bond. In ethene, both carbons are bonded to two identical hydrogens. So, there's no possibility for cis-trans isomerism because swapping the groups doesn't result in a different compound. So option D is incorrect.\n\nSo based on this, the correct answer is B. At least four sigma bonds. But wait, let me verify once more. The sigma bonds in ethene: each C has two C-H sigma bonds and one C-C sigma bond. For two carbons, that's 2*2=4 C-H sigma bonds plus 1 C-C sigma bond. Total 5 sigma bonds. So \"at least four\" is correct. So option B is correct. Therefore, the answer is B.\n</think>"}
