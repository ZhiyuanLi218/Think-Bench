So, during the Anti-Japanese War, the army captured a light machine gun. The question is about calculating how many bullets the machine gun fired in one minute based on the average recoil force. The given data includes the bullet mass, muzzle velocity, and the average recoil force. The options are A to D with numbers from 40 to 160.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some physics concepts related to momentum and force. I remember that when a gun fires a bullet, there's a recoil force due to conservation of momentum. The bullet goes forward, and the gun recoils backward. Since it's continuous firing for a minute, the average recoil force is given, so maybe I can relate that to the rate of change of momentum of the bullets.\n\nLet me think. The average force is equal to the change in momentum per unit time. That's Newton's second law, right? F = Δp/Δt. But since it's continuous firing, maybe I need to consider the momentum imparted to each bullet and multiply by the number of bullets per second.\n\nEach bullet has a mass of 8 grams. Let me convert that to kilograms for consistency with SI units. 8 grams is 0.008 kg. The muzzle velocity is 750 m/s. So the momentum of each bullet is mass times velocity, which is 0.008 kg * 750 m/s. Let me calculate that: 0.008 * 750 = 6 kg·m/s per bullet. So each bullet carries away 6 kg·m/s of momentum.\n\nNow, the average recoil force is 12 N. Force is the rate of change of momentum, so if F_avg = Δp_total / Δt. Here, Δt is 1 minute, which is 60 seconds. But actually, since it's average force over time, maybe it's F_avg = (number of bullets * momentum per bullet) / time. Let me write that equation.\n\nLet n be the number of bullets fired in time t. Then total momentum change is n * p_per_bullet. Therefore, F_avg = (n * p_per_bullet) / t. Solving for n: n = (F_avg * t) / p_per_bullet.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: F_avg is 12 N, t is 60 seconds, p_per_bullet is 6 kg·m/s.\n\nSo n = (12 N * 60 s) / 6 kg·m/s. Let me compute that. 12 * 60 is 720. Then 720 divided by 6 is 120. So n = 120 bullets in 1 minute. Therefore, the answer should be option C, 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed anything. For example, is there any consideration about the gun's recoil and the time over which each bullet is fired? But since we are given the average force over the entire minute, and assuming each bullet is fired instantaneously (or the time between bullets is considered in the average), maybe the approach is correct. Alternatively, if the machine gun fires at a certain rate, say r bullets per second, then the total momentum per second would be r * p_per_bullet, and average force is equal to that. So F_avg = r * p_per_bullet. Then r = F_avg / p_per_bullet. Then total bullets in 60 seconds would be r * 60 = (F_avg / p_per_bullet) * 60. Which is the same as above. So yes, same calculation. Therefore, 12 / 6 * 60 = 2 * 60 = 120. So that's consistent. So answer is C.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again. 8 grams is 0.008 kg. 0.008 kg * 750 m/s = 6 kg·m/s per bullet. Yes. Then average force is 12 N. So 12 N = (number of bullets per second) * 6 kg·m/s. Therefore, number per second is 12 / 6 = 2 bullets per second. Then in 60 seconds, 2 * 60 = 120 bullets. Yep, that seems right. So the answer is C, 120. So the correct option is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
