Hmm, let me start by recalling what a y-intercept is. If I remember correctly, a y-intercept is a point where the graph crosses the y-axis. On the y-axis, the value of x is 0, right? So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set x equal to 0 in the equation and solve for y. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me write that down. If x = 0, then:\n\n0 = y² - 4y - 1\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of y. To solve for y, I can use the quadratic formula. The standard form of a quadratic equation is ay² + by + c = 0. Comparing that to my equation, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -1. Let me double-check that. The equation is y² - 4y - 1 = 0. Yes, so coefficients are correct.\n\nThe quadratic formula is y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Plugging in the values:\n\ny = [-(-4) ± √((-4)² - 4*1*(-1))]/(2*1)\n\nSimplifying step by step. First, compute the numerator:\n\n-(-4) is 4. Then inside the square root, (-4)² is 16. Then, 4ac is 4*1*(-1) which is -4. But since there's a minus sign in front of that in the discriminant, it becomes -(-4) which is +4. So the discriminant is 16 + 4 = 20. Therefore, the numerator becomes 4 ± √20.\n\nThen the denominator is 2*1 = 2. So overall:\n\ny = [4 ± √20]/2\n\nNow, let me simplify √20. √20 is equal to √(4*5) which is 2√5. So substituting back:\n\ny = [4 ± 2√5]/2\n\nNow, I can factor out a 2 in the numerator:\n\ny = 2[2 ± √5]/2\n\nThe 2 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so:\n\ny = 2 ± √5\n\nTherefore, there are two solutions: y = 2 + √5 and y = 2 - √5.\n\nWait, so that would mean there are two y-intercepts? Let me think again. The original equation is a parabola. But this is a parabola that opens either to the right or left because it's solved for x in terms of y. So, the standard parabola equations: if it's x = ay² + by + c, then it's a horizontal parabola. If a is positive, it opens to the right; if negative, to the left. In this case, the coefficient of y² is 1, which is positive, so it opens to the right.\n\nBut how does that relate to intercepts? Well, the y-intercepts occur where x=0, so if the parabola crosses the y-axis, which is at x=0. Since it opens to the right, its vertex is somewhere, and depending on where the vertex is, it might cross the y-axis once or twice or not at all. In this case, solving x=0 gave me two real solutions, so that would mean two points where y is 2 + √5 and 2 - √5 when x=0. Therefore, two y-intercepts.\n\nBut let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me verify my calculation.\n\nOriginal equation: x = y² - 4y - 1.\n\nSet x=0: 0 = y² - 4y - 1.\n\nQuadratic in y: discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4*1*(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20. Correct. So discriminant is positive, which means two real roots. So two solutions. Therefore, two y-intercepts. So answer is 2?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The question is about y-intercepts. Normally, for functions, we talk about intercepts. But this is a parabola that's not a function because it fails the vertical line test. However, intercepts are just points where the graph crosses the axis, regardless of whether it's a function or not. So even though it's a horizontal parabola, which isn't a function, it can still have y-intercepts.\n\nBut maybe there's a different way to think about it. Let me also try to visualize or think about the graph. The equation is x = y² - 4y - 1. Let me try completing the square to find the vertex. Maybe that can help me understand.\n\nStarting with x = y² - 4y - 1.\n\nTo complete the square for the y terms: take y² - 4y. The coefficient of y is -4, half of that is -2, square is 4. So add and subtract 4:\n\nx = (y² - 4y + 4 - 4) - 1\n\nWhich is x = (y - 2)^2 - 4 - 1\n\nSimplify: x = (y - 2)^2 - 5\n\nSo the vertex is at (h, k) where x = h = -5 and y = k = 2. Wait, for horizontal parabolas, the standard form is x = a(y - k)^2 + h. So vertex is at (h, k). Therefore, here, vertex is at (-5, 2). So the vertex is at x = -5, y = 2. Since the coefficient of the squared term is positive (1), it opens to the right.\n\nSo, the vertex is at (-5, 2). So when y = 2, x = -5. Now, if I want to find the y-intercepts, that's when x = 0. So moving from the vertex, which is at x = -5, we need to see how the parabola progresses to the right. Since it opens to the right, as y increases or decreases from 2, x increases. Therefore, there should be two points where x = 0, one above the vertex and one below? Wait, but the vertex is at x = -5. So when x increases from -5 to 0, that's moving to the right. For each x value greater than -5, there are two y's? Wait, no. For a horizontal parabola, each x corresponds to two y's? Wait, no. For each x greater than or equal to h (the vertex x-coordinate), there are two y-values, one above and one below the vertex. So when x increases from -5 onwards, there are two y's for each x. Therefore, when x = 0, which is greater than -5, there should be two y-values. Which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, two y-intercepts. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut let me also think if there is a case where maybe solving gives complex numbers, so no intercepts. But since discriminant was positive (20), so two real solutions. So two y-intercepts. So answer is 2. Therefore, the graph has two y-intercepts.\n\nBut let me check with numbers. Let me approximate √5 ≈ 2.236. Therefore, 2 + √5 ≈ 4.236 and 2 - √5 ≈ -0.236. Therefore, the y-intercepts are at approximately (0, 4.236) and (0, -0.236). Let me plug these back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, take y ≈ 4.236:\n\nx = (4.236)^2 - 4*(4.236) - 1.\n\nCompute 4.236 squared. Well, since y = 2 + √5, let's do exact calculation:\n\nLet y = 2 + √5.\n\nx = (2 + √5)^2 - 4*(2 + √5) - 1.\n\nExpanding (2 + √5)^2: 4 + 4√5 + 5 = 9 + 4√5.\n\nThen subtract 4*(2 + √5): which is 8 + 4√5.\n\nSo, 9 + 4√5 - 8 - 4√5 - 1 = (9 - 8 - 1) + (4√5 - 4√5) = 0 + 0 = 0. Perfect, that works.\n\nSimilarly for y = 2 - √5:\n\nx = (2 - √5)^2 - 4*(2 - √5) - 1.\n\nCompute (2 - √5)^2: 4 - 4√5 + 5 = 9 - 4√5.\n\nSubtract 4*(2 - √5): which is 8 - 4√5.\n\nSo, 9 - 4√5 - 8 + 4√5 - 1 = (9 - 8 - 1) + (-4√5 + 4√5) = 0 + 0 = 0. Also works. So both points are indeed on the graph. Therefore, two y-intercepts. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut let me also think if there is any other way this could be interpreted. For example, sometimes people confuse x-intercepts and y-intercepts. For x-intercepts, you set y=0, but here we are dealing with y-intercepts. Also, since this is a horizontal parabola, maybe someone might think that it can't have y-intercepts? But no, intercepts are just where it crosses the axis, regardless of direction. For example, a horizontal line like x = 3 would be vertical, but a parabola opening left or right can cross the y-axis multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, if I graph this equation, I can imagine plotting some points. For example, when y = 0, x = 0 - 0 -1 = -1. So ( -1, 0 ) is on the graph. When y = 1, x = 1 - 4 -1 = -4. When y = 2, x = 4 - 8 -1 = -5, which is the vertex. When y = 3, x = 9 - 12 -1 = -4. When y = 4, x = 16 - 16 -1 = -1. When y = 5, x = 25 - 20 -1 = 4. So at y = 5, x is positive. So between y=4 and y=5, x goes from -1 to 4, so crosses x=0 somewhere there. Similarly, when y is less than 2, say y=1, x=-4; y=0, x=-1; y=-1, x=1 +4 -1=4. Wait, y=-1: x = (-1)^2 -4*(-1) -1 = 1 +4 -1=4. So when y=-1, x=4. Therefore, moving from y=-1 (x=4) to y=0 (x=-1), so crosses x=0 somewhere between y=-1 and y=0. Therefore, two crossings: one between y=-1 and 0, and another between y=4 and 5. Which matches our exact solutions of y ≈ -0.236 and y≈4.236. Therefore, two y-intercepts. So that seems to confirm it.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I think the answer is 2. The graph has two y-intercepts.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe graph of the parabola has \\boxed{2} y-intercepts.\n</think>"}
