That is, for any root $ r $ of $ f(x) $, the value $ r - 5 $ will be a root of $ g(x) $. So, if the roots of $ f(x) $ are $ r_1, r_2, r_3 $, then the roots of $ g(x) $ are:\n$$\nr_1 - 5, \\quad r_2 - 5, \\quad r_3 - 5.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the roots of $ g(x) $ is:\n$$\n(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use Vieta’s Formula on $ f(x) $\n\nGiven:\n$$\nf(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015,\n$$\nwe apply Vieta’s formula for the sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial $ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d $:\n$$\n\\text{Sum of roots} = -\\frac{b}{a} = -(-49)/1 = 49.\n$$\n\nSo the sum of the roots of $ f(x) $ is 49.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Sum of the Roots of $ g(x) $\n\nUsing the earlier result:\n$$\n\\text{Sum of roots of } g(x) = 49 - 15 = 34.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verification via Expansion\n\nWe can confirm this by expanding $ g(x) = f(x + 5) $:\n\n$$\ng(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015.\n$$\n\nExpanding each term:\n- $ (x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 $\n- $ -49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225 $\n- $ 623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115 $\n- Constant term: $ -2015 $\n\nCombining all terms:\n$$\ng(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x.\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\ng(x) = x(x^2 - 34x + 208).\n$$\n\nFactoring the quadratic:\n$$\nx^2 - 34x + 208 = (x - 8)(x - 26).\n$$\n\nSo the roots of $ g(x) $ are:\n$$\n0, \\quad 8, \\quad 26.\n$$\n\nSum of roots: $ 0 + 8 + 26 = 34 $, which matches our earlier result.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{34}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the roots of the function g(x), which is defined as f(x + 5). The original function f(x) is given by f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. \n\nFirst, let me recall that for any cubic equation of the form ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a. This comes from Vieta's formulas. So if I can figure out the coefficients of g(x), then I can apply Vieta's formula directly to find the sum of its roots.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way than expanding g(x) = f(x + 5) fully? Let me think. Since shifting the function horizontally by 5 units to the left (since it's x + 5) would affect the roots. If the original function f(x) has roots r1, r2, r3, then the function g(x) = f(x + 5) would have roots such that x + 5 = r1, x + 5 = r2, x + 5 = r3. Therefore, the roots of g(x) would be r1 - 5, r2 - 5, r3 - 5. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (r1 - 5) + (r2 - 5) + (r3 - 5) = (r1 + r2 + r3) - 15. \n\nSo if I can find the sum of the roots of f(x), then subtract 15, I can get the answer. \n\nUsing Vieta's formula on f(x): the sum of the roots of f(x) is -(-49)/1 = 49. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 49 - 15 = 34. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me verify this by expanding g(x) to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me try expanding f(x + 5). Let's compute f(x + 5):\n\nf(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.\n\nFirst, expand each term:\n\n1. (x + 5)³: Let's expand this. The formula for (a + b)³ is a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So:\n\n(x + 5)³ = x³ + 3x²*5 + 3x*5² + 5³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.\n\n2. -49(x + 5)²: First, expand (x + 5)²:\n\n(x + 5)² = x² + 10x + 25. Then multiply by -49:\n\n-49x² - 490x - 1225.\n\n3. 623(x + 5): Distribute 623:\n\n623x + 3115.\n\n4. -2015: Just remains as is.\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\nStart with the x³ term:\n\nx³.\n\nThen x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = (15 - 49)x² = -34x².\n\nx terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that:\n\n75 - 490 = -415; -415 + 623 = 208. So 208x.\n\nConstant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 125 - 1225 = -1100.\n\nThen -1100 + 3115 = 2015.\n\nThen 2015 - 2015 = 0. \n\nWait, so the constant term is 0?\n\nSo putting it all together, g(x) = f(x + 5) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0. Therefore, the cubic is x³ - 34x² + 208x.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) is -(-34)/1 = 34. Which matches my earlier result. So that's good. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 34. \n\nBut let me check again the constant term because that seems surprising. Let me recalculate the constants:\n\nOriginal constants after expansion:\n\nFrom (x + 5)^3: +125.\n\nFrom -49(x + 5)^2: -49*(25) = -1225.\n\nFrom 623(x + 5): +623*5. Let me compute that again. 600*5=3000, 23*5=115, so total 3115. Correct.\n\nFrom -2015: -2015.\n\nSo total constants:\n\n125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 125 - 1225 is indeed -1100. Then -1100 + 3115 is 2015. Then 2015 - 2015 is 0. So yes, the constant term is zero. Therefore, the cubic is x³ - 34x² + 208x. Which factors as x(x² - 34x + 208). \n\nTherefore, the roots are x = 0 and roots of x² - 34x + 208 = 0. The sum of the roots of the quadratic is 34, and adding the root at 0 gives total sum 34 + 0 = 34. So that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the roots explicitly, but since we only need the sum, Vieta suffices. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about shifting the graph of f(x) left by 5 units, then the roots shift right by 5? Wait, no. If g(x) = f(x + 5), then solving g(x) = 0 is equivalent to f(x + 5) = 0, which implies x + 5 is a root of f. Therefore, if r is a root of f, then x = r - 5 is a root of g. Therefore, as I thought earlier, the roots of g are each of the roots of f shifted left by 5? Wait, no, if you replace x with x + 5 in f, then to get a root, you need x + 5 = root of f. Therefore, x = (root of f) - 5. Therefore, the roots of g are shifted left by 5? Wait, if you have a function f(x), and you take f(x + a), then the graph is shifted to the left by a. Therefore, the roots also shift left by a. But if you want to find the roots of g(x) = f(x + 5), then each root of f, say r, corresponds to a root of g at r - 5. Therefore, the roots of g are shifted left by 5 compared to the roots of f. Therefore, the sum of roots is sum(f_roots) - 3*5 = sum(f_roots) - 15. Which is 49 - 15 = 34. \n\nSo all methods lead to 34. Therefore, I think the answer is 34.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in expanding, let me check the coefficients again. Let me recompute f(x + 5):\n\nFirst term: (x + 5)^3 = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125. Correct.\n\nSecond term: -49*(x + 5)^2. Let me recompute (x + 5)^2: x² + 10x + 25. Multiply by -49: -49x² - 490x - 1225. Correct.\n\nThird term: 623*(x + 5) = 623x + 3115. Correct.\n\nFourth term: -2015. Correct.\n\nNow, adding all together:\n\nx³ + 15x² + 75x + 125 -49x² -490x -1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx³ + (15x² - 49x²) + (75x - 490x + 623x) + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015).\n\nCalculates as:\n\nx³ - 34x² + (75 - 490 is -415; -415 + 623 is 208)x + (125 - 1225 is -1100; -1100 + 3115 is 2015; 2015 - 2015 is 0). Yep. So the expansion is correct. \n\nTherefore, the cubic is x³ - 34x² + 208x. Therefore, the sum of roots is 34. \n\nAlternatively, since the cubic can be factored as x(x² - 34x + 208). Let me check if the quadratic factors further. Let me compute the discriminant: 34² - 4*1*208. 34² is 1156. 4*208 is 832. So discriminant is 1156 - 832 = 324. Square root of 324 is 18. Therefore, roots are [34 ± 18]/2. Which is (34 + 18)/2 = 52/2 = 26, and (34 - 18)/2 = 16/2 = 8. Therefore, the roots of g(x) are 0, 26, and 8. Therefore, sum is 0 + 26 + 8 = 34. Yep, same result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 34. \n\nBut just to make sure that my initial approach was correct, let me check with actual roots. Suppose I find roots of f(x). Let me try to find roots of f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. \n\nBut solving a cubic might be complicated, but maybe there are integer roots? Let me try rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 2015 over factors of 1. Factors of 2015: 1, 5, 13, 31, 65, 155, 403, 2015. Let me test them.\n\nFirst, try x=5: f(5) = 125 - 49*25 + 623*5 - 2015. Compute:\n\n125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let me compute:\n\n125 - 1225 = -1100; -1100 + 3115 = 2015; 2015 - 2015 = 0. Oh! So x=5 is a root. Therefore, (x - 5) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 5:\n\nCoefficients of f(x): 1 (x³), -49 (x²), 623 (x), -2015 (constant).\n\nSet up synthetic division:\n\n5 | 1   -49   623   -2015\n\n  |     5   -220   2015\n\n  ---------------------------\n\n    1   -44   403     0\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (x - 5)(x² - 44x + 403). Now, let's check the quadratic x² - 44x + 403. Let me compute discriminant: 44² - 4*1*403. 44² is 1936. 4*403 is 1612. Discriminant is 1936 - 1612 = 324. Wait, same discriminant as before? sqrt(324) is 18. Therefore, roots are [44 ± 18]/2 = 62/2 = 31 and 26/2 = 13. Wait, 44 + 18 = 62, divided by 2 is 31; 44 - 18 = 26, divided by 2 is 13. Therefore, the roots of f(x) are 5, 31, 13. Therefore, sum of roots is 5 + 31 + 13 = 49. Which matches Vieta's formula. \n\nTherefore, the roots of f(x) are 5, 13, 31. Therefore, the roots of g(x) = f(x + 5) are each of these minus 5. Therefore:\n\n5 - 5 = 0,\n\n13 - 5 = 8,\n\n31 - 5 = 26.\n\nTherefore, the roots of g(x) are 0, 8, 26. Sum is 0 + 8 + 26 = 34. Which is the same as before. \n\nTherefore, all methods confirm that the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 34. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{34}\n</think>"}
