The atomic number decreases by 1 (from 13 to 12), and the mass number remains the same (26). This transformation is characteristic of beta plus decay.\n\n---\n\n### **Option Analysis**\n\n#### **Option A:**  \n*\"The mass of the ${ }^{26} \\mathrm{Al}$ nucleus is equal to the mass of the ${ }^{26} \\mathrm{Mg}$ nucleus.\"*\n\n- **Incorrect.**  \n  In a decay process, the parent nucleus (Al-26) must have a **greater mass** than the daughter nucleus (Mg-26) and the emitted positron combined. The mass difference is what enables the decay to occur, as it corresponds to the energy released in the form of the positron and neutrino.\n\n#### **Option B:**  \n*\"The neutron number of the ${ }^{26} \\mathrm{Al}$ nucleus is greater than that of the ${ }^{26} \\mathrm{Mg}$ nucleus.\"*\n\n- **Incorrect.**  \n  - Al-26 has atomic number 13, so its neutron number is $26 - 13 = 13$.\n  - Mg-26 has atomic number 12, so its neutron number is $26 - 12 = 14$.\n  - Therefore, the **neutron number of Al-26 is less than** that of Mg-26.\n\n#### **Option C:**  \n*\"Placing the aluminum isotope ${ }^{26} \\mathrm{Al}$ in a low-temperature, low-pressure environment, its half-life remains unchanged.\"*\n\n- **Correct.**  \n  The **half-life of a radioactive isotope** is a **nuclear property** and is **independent** of external conditions such as temperature, pressure, or chemical environment. It is a fundamental characteristic of the isotope itself.\n\n#### **Option D:**  \n*\"The existing aluminum isotope ${ }^{26} \\mathrm{Al}$ in the Milky Way will completely decay into ${ }^{26} \\mathrm{Mg}$ in 1.44 million years.\"*\n\n- **Incorrect.**  \n  The **half-life** of ${ }^{26} \\mathrm{Al}$ is 720,000 years. After one half-life, half of the isotope remains. After **two half-lives (1.44 million years)**, only **25%** of the original isotope remains. Radioactive decay follows an **exponential** decay pattern and **never reaches zero**. So, the isotope will **never completely decay**, even after many half-lives.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question. It's about the beta decay of Aluminum-26. The question gives the decay equation as ²⁶₁₃Al → ²⁶₁₂Mg + ₀¹e. The half-life is 720,000 years. We need to pick the correct statement from the options A to D.\n\nFirst, let me recall what beta decay involves. In beta minus decay, a neutron converts into a proton, emitting an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino. But the equation here shows a positive beta decay? Wait, no, the equation shows Al-26 decaying into Mg-26 and emitting a positron (since it's ₀¹e). Wait, positron emission is beta plus decay. In that case, a proton converts into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So, the atomic number decreases by one, which matches the equation here: Al (Z=13) becomes Mg (Z=12) with the emission of a positron (which is a beta plus particle). So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: The mass of the ²⁶Al nucleus is equal to the mass of the ²⁶Mg nucleus. Hmm. In beta decay, the mass of the parent nucleus should be greater than the daughter nucleus plus the emitted particle, because the decay occurs due to mass difference. Since energy is released, the parent nucleus must have more mass. So the mass of Al-26 should be greater than Mg-26 plus the positron. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it says the masses are equal. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B: The neutron number of Al-26 is greater than that of Mg-26. Let's check. For Al-26, Z=13, so number of neutrons N = 26 - 13 = 13. For Mg-26, Z=12, so N = 26 -12 =14. Wait, so Al-26 has 13 neutrons, Mg-26 has 14. Therefore, the neutron number of Al-26 is less than Mg-26. So option B says it's greater, which is incorrect. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: Placing the Al-26 in low temp, low pressure environment, its half-life remains unchanged. I remember that half-life is a property of the nucleus and is independent of external conditions like temperature, pressure, chemical environment. So even if you put it in extreme conditions, the half-life doesn't change. So C is correct. So C is a possible correct answer.\n\nOption D: The existing Al-26 in the Milky Way will completely decay into Mg-26 in 1.44 million years. Well, the half-life is 720,000 years. After one half-life, half remains. After two half-lives (1.44 million years), 1/4 remains. But it never completely decays. So D is incorrect because it says \"completely decay\", which is not true. Radioactive decay follows an exponential curve, so it approaches zero but never reaches it. So D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>"}
