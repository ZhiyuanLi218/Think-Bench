Hmm, let's see. First, I should make sure I have the correct formulas for all the compounds. Vanadium nitrate is V(NO3)3, right? Because vanadium has a +3 charge and nitrate is -1, so three nitrates are needed. Magnesium nitrate is Mg(NO3)2 because magnesium is +2 and nitrate is -1, so two nitrates. \n\nSo the unbalanced equation is: V(NO3)3 + Mg → V + Mg(NO3)2. \n\nLet me list out the elements on each side. On the left side, we have vanadium (V), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and magnesium (Mg). On the right side, we have vanadium, magnesium, nitrogen, and oxygen again. \n\nFirst, let me count each element. Let's start with vanadium. On the left, there's 1 V in V(NO3)3. On the right, there's 1 V in V. So vanadium is balanced. \n\nNext, magnesium. On the left, there's 1 Mg. On the right, there's 1 Mg in Mg(NO3)2. So magnesium is balanced. \n\nNow, nitrogen. In V(NO3)3, there are 3 nitrate ions, each with one nitrogen, so 3 N. On the right, in Mg(NO3)2, there are 2 nitrate ions, so 2 N. So nitrogen is unbalanced. \n\nOxygen is also going to be tricky because it's in nitrate ions. Let's count oxygen. In V(NO3)3, each nitrate has 3 oxygen, so 3*3=9 O. On the right, in Mg(NO3)2, each nitrate has 3 O, so 2*3=6 O. So oxygen is also unbalanced. \n\nSo the problem is with nitrogen and oxygen. Let me try to balance the nitrate groups. Maybe if I adjust the coefficients for the nitrate compounds. Let me see. Let me consider the nitrate ions as a group. On the left, we have 3 nitrate ions, and on the right, we have 2 nitrate ions. To balance the nitrate groups, I need the same number on both sides. Let me find the least common multiple of 3 and 2, which is 6. So if I have 2 V(NO3)3 on the left, that would give 6 nitrate ions. Then on the right, if I have 3 Mg(NO3)2, that would also give 6 nitrate ions. \n\nSo let me try that. Let me put a coefficient of 2 in front of V(NO3)3 and a coefficient of 3 in front of Mg(NO3)2. \n\nSo the equation becomes: 2 V(NO3)3 + Mg → 2 V + 3 Mg(NO3)2. \n\nNow let's check the elements again. \n\nVanadium: Left side has 2 V (from 2 V(NO3)3), right side has 2 V (from 2 V). Balanced. \n\nMagnesium: Left side has 1 Mg, right side has 3 Mg (from 3 Mg(NO3)2). Not balanced. \n\nSo magnesium is unbalanced. Let me adjust the coefficient for Mg on the left. Since there are 3 Mg on the right, I need 3 Mg on the left. So put a 3 in front of Mg. \n\nNow the equation is: 2 V(NO3)3 + 3 Mg → 2 V + 3 Mg(NO3)2. \n\nLet me check again. \n\nVanadium: 2 on left, 2 on right. Good. \n\nMagnesium: 3 on left, 3 on right. Good. \n\nNitrogen: Left side: 2 * 3 = 6 N (from nitrate in V(NO3)3). Right side: 3 * 2 = 6 N (from nitrate in Mg(NO3)2). Balanced. \n\nOxygen: Left side: 2 * 9 = 18 O (from nitrate in V(NO3)3). Right side: 3 * 6 = 18 O (from nitrate in Mg(NO3)2). Balanced. \n\nSo all elements are balanced now. \n\nWait, let me just double-check. \n\nLeft side: 2 V, 3 Mg, 6 N, 18 O. \n\nRight side: 2 V, 3 Mg, 6 N, 18 O. \n\nYes, all elements are balanced. So the balanced equation is 2 V(NO3)3 + 3 Mg → 2 V + 3 Mg(NO3)2. \n\nI think that's it. Let me make sure there are no mistakes. Let me count each element again. \n\nVanadium: 2 on both sides. \n\nMagnesium: 3 on both sides. \n\nNitrogen: 2*3=6 on left, 3*2=6 on right. \n\nOxygen: 2*3*3=18 on left, 3*2*3=18 on right. \n\nYes, all balanced. So the coefficients are 2, 3, 2, 3. \n\nTherefore, the balanced equation is 2 V(NO3)3 + 3 Mg → 2 V + 3 Mg(NO3)2. \n\nI don't see any other elements to consider. The reaction is between vanadium nitrate and magnesium to produce vanadium and magnesium nitrate. The stoichiometry is correct with the coefficients 2, 3, 2, 3. \n\nI think that's the correct balanced equation.\n</think>"}
