The mass is m, and gravity is acting along the z-axis. Alright, let's start by recalling how to approach such problems.\n\nFirst, I remember that for small oscillations around a stable equilibrium, we usually need to find the equilibrium position, then expand the potential energy around that point, and then use Lagrangian mechanics or Newtonian methods to find the equations of motion. From there, we can set up the equations in matrix form and solve for the normal modes and frequencies.\n\nLet me start by finding the equilibrium position. Since the particle is constrained to move on the surface z = x² + y² - xy, and gravity is acting downward (since z is upward), the potential energy of the particle is due to gravity. Assuming gravity has magnitude g, the potential energy U is m g z. Therefore, substituting z:\n\nU = m g (x² + y² - x y)\n\nBut wait, actually, since z is upward and gravity is downward, the potential energy should be U = -m g z? Wait no, gravitational potential energy near Earth's surface is U = m g h, where h is the height. If z is upward, then higher z means higher potential energy. So yes, U = m g z. So the potential energy is m g times the height z, which is m g (x² + y² - x y). So that's correct.\n\nNow, the equilibrium position is where the potential energy is minimized. Since the particle is constrained to move on the surface, we need to find the minimum of U with respect to x and y. However, since z is determined by x and y, the problem reduces to finding the minimum of U(x, y) = m g (x² + y² - x y). Let me ignore the m g factor for a moment because it's just a constant multiplier; the minima will be the same as for the function x² + y² - x y.\n\nSo let's find the critical points by taking partial derivatives.\n\nFirst, compute ∂U/∂x and ∂U/∂y.\n\nLet me define f(x, y) = x² + y² - x y.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x: 2x - y.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to y: 2y - x.\n\nSet them equal to zero:\n\n2x - y = 0\n\n2y - x = 0\n\nSo we have the system:\n\nFrom first equation: y = 2x\n\nSubstitute into second equation: 2*(2x) - x = 4x - x = 3x = 0 => x = 0. Therefore, y = 2x = 0. Therefore, the only critical point is at (0, 0). Let me check if this is a minimum.\n\nTo check if it's a minimum, compute the second derivatives.\n\nSecond partial derivatives:\n\nf_xx = 2\n\nf_xy = -1\n\nf_yx = -1\n\nf_yy = 2\n\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n\n[ 2   -1 ]\n\n[ -1   2 ]\n\nThe determinant is (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 > 0, and since f_xx = 2 > 0, it's a local minimum. Therefore, the stable equilibrium position is at (x, y) = (0, 0), which corresponds to z = 0² + 0² - 0*0 = 0. So the equilibrium is at the origin (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow, we need to consider small oscillations around this equilibrium. For small oscillations, we can approximate the potential energy by a quadratic form (since the linear terms vanish at equilibrium). The kinetic energy will also be quadratic in velocities. Then, we can write the Lagrangian and find the equations of motion.\n\nBut wait, the particle is constrained to move on the surface z = x² + y² - x y. However, for small oscillations around (0,0,0), since z is approximately 0 (because x and y are small), maybe we can approximate the surface as flat? Wait, but z is quadratic in x and y, so for small oscillations, maybe we need to consider the constraint. However, since the particle is moving on the surface, we need to take into account the constraint. However, if the oscillations are small, maybe we can approximate the surface as a paraboloid, and perhaps use coordinates x and y as generalized coordinates, with z being dependent.\n\nAlternatively, since the particle is moving on a surface under gravity, we can consider the motion as a constrained system. But for small oscillations, perhaps we can approximate the potential energy as a quadratic form in x and y, and the kinetic energy as usual.\n\nBut let me think. The kinetic energy in three dimensions is T = (1/2) m (v_x² + v_y² + v_z²). However, since z is dependent on x and y, we can express v_z in terms of v_x and v_y.\n\nGiven z = x² + y² - x y, then dz/dt = 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt - x dy/dt - y dx/dt = (2x - y) dx/dt + (2y - x) dy/dt.\n\nTherefore, v_z = (2x - y) v_x + (2y - x) v_y.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy is:\n\nT = (1/2) m [v_x² + v_y² + ((2x - y) v_x + (2y - x) v_y)^2 ]\n\nBut since we are considering small oscillations around (0,0,0), x and y are small, so we can expand this expression in terms of small quantities. However, since we are looking for small oscillations, we can consider that x and y are small, so terms involving x and y multiplied by velocities can be considered as small compared to the terms without x and y. Wait, but in the kinetic energy, the term ((2x - y) v_x + (2y - x) v_y)^2 would be quadratic in x and y and velocities. But for small oscillations, we usually consider the kinetic energy up to quadratic terms in velocities, and the potential energy up to quadratic terms in coordinates. However, here, the kinetic energy has terms that are products of coordinates and velocities. But if x and y are small, then maybe we can approximate the kinetic energy by neglecting the terms involving x and y multiplied by velocities? Wait, but if we do that, then v_z would be zero, which isn't correct. However, for very small oscillations around (0,0,0), where x and y are very small, the terms (2x - y) and (2y - x) would also be small. Therefore, maybe we can approximate the kinetic energy as T ≈ (1/2) m (v_x² + v_y²) + ... higher order terms?\n\nBut if we do that, then we are neglecting the vertical motion, which might not be correct. However, since the particle is constrained to move on the surface, its motion is entirely determined by x and y. But for small oscillations, perhaps the vertical motion is negligible compared to horizontal? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe we need to perform a Taylor expansion of the kinetic energy up to quadratic terms in coordinates and velocities.\n\nLet me think again. For small oscillations, we usually expand both the potential and kinetic energy around the equilibrium point up to quadratic terms. The potential energy we already have as U ≈ (1/2) k_xx x² + (1/2) k_yy y² + k_xy x y, but in our case, the potential energy is U = m g z = m g (x² + y² - x y). Therefore, already quadratic in x and y. So U is already quadratic, so no need to expand further. However, the kinetic energy is not purely quadratic in velocities, because of the z-component. But since z depends on x and y, which are small, maybe we can expand the kinetic energy in terms of x and y.\n\nSo let's write the kinetic energy:\n\nT = (1/2) m [v_x² + v_y² + v_z²]\n\nBut v_z = dz/dt = (2x - y) v_x + (2y - x) v_y.\n\nTherefore, v_z² = [ (2x - y) v_x + (2y - x) v_y ]²\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= (2x - y)^2 v_x² + (2y - x)^2 v_y² + 2(2x - y)(2y - x) v_x v_y\n\nNow, since we are considering small oscillations around (0,0,0), x and y are small. Therefore, terms involving x and y multiplied by velocities will be small. However, in the kinetic energy, we need to consider whether these terms are significant. For the Lagrangian, we usually consider terms up to quadratic in velocities and coordinates. However, here, the cross terms involve products of coordinates and velocities. But if x and y are small, then maybe these terms can be neglected? Wait, but if we neglect them, then the kinetic energy would be T ≈ (1/2) m (v_x² + v_y²). However, this would be incorrect because the actual motion includes vertical movement, but for small oscillations, maybe the vertical velocity is negligible? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider that for small oscillations, x and y are small, so (2x - y) and (2y - x) are small, so v_z is small. Therefore, v_z² is of second order in small quantities. However, if we are expanding the kinetic energy up to quadratic terms, then v_z² is quadratic in velocities and coordinates? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf x and y are small (say of order ε), then (2x - y) and (2y - x) are of order ε. If velocities are of order, say, η, then v_z is of order ε η. Therefore, v_z² is of order ε² η². On the other hand, the other terms in the kinetic energy, v_x² and v_y², are of order η². Therefore, if ε is small, then v_z² is negligible compared to v_x² and v_y². Therefore, for small oscillations, we can approximate the kinetic energy as T ≈ (1/2) m (v_x² + v_y²). Therefore, the vertical motion contributes a higher order term and can be neglected. Therefore, the Lagrangian is approximately:\n\nL = T - U ≈ (1/2) m (v_x² + v_y²) - m g (x² + y² - x y)\n\nBut wait, this seems too simple. However, if we neglect the vertical kinetic energy, then we are assuming that the vertical motion is negligible. However, in reality, when the particle moves horizontally, it also moves vertically, so the kinetic energy isn't purely horizontal. However, for small oscillations, maybe this is a valid approximation? Or maybe we need to consider the exact kinetic energy but expand it to the necessary order?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use coordinates x and y as generalized coordinates and perform the expansion properly.\n\nLet me try to compute the kinetic energy more carefully. Let me denote the velocities as ẋ and ẏ. Then:\n\nv_z = (2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ\n\nTherefore, T = (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + ( (2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )² ]\n\nExpanding the square term:\n\n( (2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )² = (2x - y)^2 ẋ² + (2y - x)^2 ẏ² + 2(2x - y)(2y - x) ẋ ẏ\n\nNow, since we are considering small oscillations around x=0, y=0, we can expand this expression in terms of small x and y. Let me note that for small oscillations, x and y are small, so terms with x and y multiplied by velocities can be considered as small compared to terms without x and y. However, when considering the kinetic energy, we need to keep terms up to quadratic in coordinates and velocities. Let me see:\n\nThe term (2x - y)^2 ẋ² is quadratic in x and y and quadratic in velocity. Similarly for the others. Therefore, if we are expanding the kinetic energy up to quadratic terms, these terms would be of second order in small quantities. Therefore, if we are doing a harmonic approximation (quadratic in coordinates and velocities), then these terms are already quadratic and should be kept. Wait, but in standard small oscillations, we usually have kinetic energy quadratic in velocities and potential energy quadratic in coordinates. However, here, the kinetic energy has cross terms between coordinates and velocities. But in the Lagrangian formalism, the kinetic energy is allowed to have such terms. However, when we derive the equations of motion, these terms will contribute to the equations.\n\nBut since we are looking for normal modes, which usually assume that the kinetic and potential energies are quadratic in coordinates and velocities, with the kinetic energy being homogeneous quadratic in velocities and the potential being homogeneous quadratic in coordinates. However, in this case, the kinetic energy has terms that mix coordinates and velocities. Therefore, perhaps we need to keep them.\n\nBut for small oscillations, maybe we can approximate the kinetic energy by neglecting these terms? Wait, but if we do that, then we have T ≈ (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²), which is the standard kinetic energy for a free particle. However, the potential energy is U = m g (x² + y² - x y). Therefore, combining these, we can write the Lagrangian as:\n\nL = (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²) - m g (x² + y² - x y)\n\nBut then, the equations of motion would be:\n\nm ÿ = - ∂U/∂y = -m g (2y - x)\n\nm ÿ = -m g (2y - x) => ÿ + g (2y - x) = 0\n\nSimilarly for x:\n\nm ÿ = - ∂U/∂x = -m g (2x - y)\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, equations of motion from Lagrangian:\n\nd/dt (∂L/∂ẋ) - ∂L/∂x = 0 => m ẍ - (-m g (2x - y)) = 0 => m ẍ = -m g (2x - y) => ẍ = -g (2x - y)\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\nm ÿ = -m g (2y - x) => ÿ = -g (2y - x)\n\nTherefore, the equations of motion are:\n\nẍ = -2g x + g y\n\nÿ = g x - 2g y\n\nSo this is a coupled system of differential equations. To find the normal modes and frequencies, we can assume solutions of the form:\n\nx(t) = A e^{i ω t}\n\ny(t) = B e^{i ω t}\n\nPlugging into the equations:\n\n- ω² A e^{i ω t} = -2g A e^{i ω t} + g B e^{i ω t}\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\n- ω² B e^{i ω t} = g A e^{i ω t} - 2g B e^{i ω t}\n\nCanceling e^{i ω t}:\n\n- ω² A = -2g A + g B => (-ω² + 2g) A - g B = 0\n\n- ω² B = g A - 2g B => -g A + (-ω² + 2g) B = 0\n\nTherefore, the system is:\n\n[ (-ω² + 2g)   -g         ] [A]   = 0\n\n[   -g         (-ω² + 2g) ] [B]     0\n\nFor non-trivial solutions, determinant must be zero:\n\n| (-ω² + 2g)   -g         |\n\n|   -g         (-ω² + 2g) |  = 0\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\n(-ω² + 2g)^2 - (-g)(-g) = 0 => ( (-ω² + 2g)^2 ) - g² = 0\n\nExpanding:\n\n(ω² - 2g)^2 - g² = 0 => Let me write it as:\n\nLet me denote ω² = Ω for simplicity:\n\n(Ω - 2g)^2 - g² = 0 => Ω² - 4g Ω + 4g² - g² = 0 => Ω² - 4g Ω + 3g² = 0\n\nSolving quadratic equation:\n\nΩ = [4g ± sqrt(16g² - 12g²)] / 2 = [4g ± sqrt(4g²)] / 2 = [4g ± 2g]/2 = (4g + 2g)/2 = 3g or (4g - 2g)/2 = g.\n\nTherefore, Ω = 3g or Ω = g. Therefore, ω² = 3g or ω² = g, so the normal frequencies are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g). But wait, Ω is ω², so ω is sqrt(Ω). Therefore, the normal frequencies are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g). However, the units here are problematic. Wait, g has units of acceleration (m/s²), so sqrt(g) would have units of 1/sqrt(s), which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be. There must be something wrong here.\n\nWait, hold on. In the equations of motion, we had:\n\nẍ = -2g x + g y\n\nBut the units here: ẍ has units of acceleration (m/s²), and -2g x would have units of (m/s²) * m = m²/s², which doesn't match. Wait, this is a problem. There must be a mistake in the derivation.\n\nWait, let me check the equations of motion again. The Lagrangian is:\n\nL = T - U = (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²) - m g (x² + y² - x y)\n\nTherefore, the equations of motion are:\n\nFor x:\n\nd/dt (dL/dẋ) - dL/dx = 0 => d/dt (m ẋ) - (-m g (2x - y)) = 0 => m ẍ + m g (2x - y) = 0 => ẍ + g (2x - y) = 0\n\nWait, previously I had written ẍ = -g (2x - y), which is correct. But when I wrote the equation:\n\n- ω² A = -2g A + g B\n\nWait, that's from:\n\nm ẍ = -m g (2x - y) => ẍ = -g (2x - y) => ẍ = -2g x + g y\n\nSo if we plug x = A e^{i ω t}, then:\n\nLeft side: ẍ = -ω² A e^{i ω t}\n\nRight side: -2g A e^{i ω t} + g B e^{i ω t}\n\nTherefore, equating:\n\n-ω² A = -2g A + g B => (-ω² + 2g) A - g B = 0\n\nSimilarly for the other equation. So that is correct.\n\nBut the problem is with the units. How come ω² has units of g? Let me check again.\n\nThe equation is ẍ = -2g x + g y. But ẍ has units of acceleration (m/s²), and -2g x has units (m/s²)(m) = m²/s²? Wait, that can't be. There is a unit inconsistency here, which suggests that my derivation is wrong. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! The potential energy is U = m g z, and z is in meters. Therefore, U has units of Joules, which is kg m²/s². The term -dU/dx is the force, which should have units of Newtons (kg m/s²). Let me check:\n\nU = m g z = m g (x² + y² - x y). Therefore, ∂U/∂x = m g (2x - y). Therefore, the force in x direction is -∂U/∂x = -m g (2x - y). Therefore, Newton's second law is m ẍ = -m g (2x - y). Therefore, ẍ = -g (2x - y). So this is correct. Therefore, the units of ẍ is m/s², and the right-hand side is -g*(2x - y). Since g is m/s², and x and y are in meters, then (2x - y) is in meters, so g*(2x - y) is (m/s²)*(m) = m²/s²? Wait, no! Wait, no, hold on. If x is in meters, then 2x - y is in meters. Multiplying by g (m/s²) gives units of m²/s²? That can't be. There is a contradiction here. Therefore, my mistake must be in the expression for the potential energy.\n\nWait, hold on! The potential energy is U = m g z. But z is x² + y² - x y. Therefore, z has units of meters squared? No! Wait, x and y are in meters, so x² is meters squared, same with y² and x y. Therefore, z is in meters squared? But z is supposed to be a vertical coordinate in meters. Therefore, this suggests that the given equation z = x² + y² - x y is dimensionally inconsistent. Unless there are some constants with units to make it consistent. But the problem says \"the surface described by the equation z = x² + y² - x y\". Therefore, probably in the problem, x and y are in units such that x² is in meters, so x and y are in meters^1/2? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe there is a missing coefficient with units to make z have units of meters. However, the problem as stated is given without such coefficients, so perhaps it's intended to be a purely mathematical problem, and we just proceed formally, ignoring the units? Or perhaps there is a typo, but assuming the problem is correct, maybe we need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the surface is actually z = a (x² + y² - x y), where a is some constant with units of 1/length, so that z has units of length. However, since the problem didn't specify that, maybe we are supposed to assume that the equation is dimensionally consistent in some unit system where, for example, x and y are dimensionless, or g has different units. But since we are to find frequencies, which have units of 1/seconds, we need to make sure that our final expression for ω has correct units.\n\nBut given that, let's suppose that the equation z = x² + y² - x y is given in some consistent unit system where x, y, z are all in meters. Then z is in meters, so x² must be in meters, so x is in sqrt(meters), which is non-standard. However, since this is a math problem, maybe we can ignore the units and proceed. Let's just proceed formally.\n\nTherefore, accepting that, then our equations of motion are:\n\nẍ = -2g x + g y\n\nÿ = g x - 2g y\n\nAnd solving the eigenvalue problem, we found frequencies squared equal to g and 3g. Therefore, frequencies are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g). But as mentioned before, units are problematic. However, since the problem didn't specify units, perhaps it's acceptable? Or maybe there is a missing factor.\n\nWait, but another thought: when we derived the equations of motion, we neglected the vertical component of the kinetic energy. However, if we had included it, maybe the equations would have different coefficients? Let me check that. Perhaps my earlier assumption to neglect the vertical kinetic energy was incorrect, leading to inconsistent units. Let me try to include it.\n\nSo going back, the kinetic energy is:\n\nT = (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + ((2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )² ]\n\nNow, for small oscillations, x and y are small, so let's assume that x, y << 1 (in whatever units). Therefore, terms like (2x - y) and (2y - x) are small. Therefore, the square term in T is quadratic in small quantities. However, in the Lagrangian, we need to keep all terms up to quadratic in coordinates and velocities. Therefore, the kinetic energy is already quadratic in velocities and coordinates. Let me write it out:\n\nLet me expand T:\n\nT = (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + ( (2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )² ]\n\nExpanding the square:\n\n= (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + ( (2x - y)^2 ẋ² + (2y - x)^2 ẏ² + 2(2x - y)(2y - x) ẋ ẏ ) ]\n\nNow, let's compute each term:\n\nFirst, (2x - y)^2 = 4x² - 4x y + y²\n\nSimilarly, (2y - x)^2 = 4y² - 4x y + x²\n\nAnd 2(2x - y)(2y - x) = 2[4x y - 2x² - 2y² + x y] = 2[5x y - 2x² - 2y²] = 10x y - 4x² - 4y². Wait, let me compute it step by step:\n\n(2x - y)(2y - x) = 2x * 2y + 2x * (-x) + (-y) * 2y + (-y)*(-x) = 4x y - 2x² - 2y² + x y = (4x y + x y) - 2x² - 2y² = 5x y - 2x² - 2y²\n\nMultiply by 2: 10x y - 4x² - 4y²\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nT = (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + (4x² - 4x y + y²) ẋ² + (4y² - 4x y + x²) ẏ² + (10x y - 4x² - 4y²) ẋ ẏ ]\n\nNow, collect like terms:\n\nLet me write T as:\n\nT = (1/2) m [ (1 + 4x² - 4x y + y²) ẋ² + (1 + 4y² - 4x y + x²) ẏ² + (10x y - 4x² - 4y²) ẋ ẏ ]\n\nBut since we are considering small oscillations, x and y are small, so we can expand this expression up to quadratic terms. However, terms like x² ẋ² are of fourth order (quadratic in x and quadratic in velocity), which would be negligible compared to terms quadratic in coordinates or velocities. Therefore, for the harmonic approximation, we need to keep terms up to quadratic in coordinates and velocities. Therefore, we can neglect terms that are higher than quadratic. Therefore, the terms 4x² ẋ², y² ẋ², etc., are quartic and can be neglected. Therefore, the kinetic energy simplifies to:\n\nT ≈ (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + (-4x y) ẋ² + (-4x y) ẏ² + (10x y) ẋ ẏ ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, when expanding, the terms that are quadratic in coordinates and velocities are:\n\nLooking at the original expansion:\n\nInside the brackets, after expanding, we have:\n\nThe terms:\n\n(4x² - 4x y + y²) ẋ² → quadratic in x and quadratic in velocity → quartic, negligible\n\nSimilarly for the others. Therefore, actually, if we are keeping only up to quadratic terms in coordinates and velocities, then all the terms involving products of x and y with velocities squared are negligible. Wait, but actually, the term ( (2x - y) ẋ + ... )² is quadratic in velocities and quadratic in coordinates. However, in the harmonic approximation, we need to consider kinetic energy as a quadratic form in velocities, with coefficients depending on coordinates. But since we are doing small oscillations around equilibrium, we can expand the kinetic energy in Taylor series around x=0, y=0, keeping terms up to quadratic in coordinates and velocities.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy can be written as:\n\nT ≈ T0 + T1 + T2 + ..., where T0 is the kinetic energy at equilibrium (which is just (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²) since x=y=0), T1 is linear in x and y (which is zero because equilibrium), and T2 is quadratic in x, y, ẋ, ẏ. Therefore, we need to compute T2.\n\nHowever, expanding T around x=0, y=0, we can use:\n\nT ≈ (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + ( (2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )² ]\n\nExpanding the square term:\n\n≈ (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + ( (2x ẋ - y ẋ + 2y ẏ - x ẏ )² ) ]\n\nBut expanding this square, the leading terms (up to quadratic in x and y) would be:\n\n(2x ẋ - y ẋ + 2y ẏ - x ẏ )² ≈ (linear terms in x and y)² ≈ quadratic in x and y times velocities squared and cross terms.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. However, since we are only interested in quadratic terms in coordinates and velocities, we can use the general formula for expanding kinetic energy for small oscillations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that for small oscillations, the kinetic energy can be written as:\n\nT = (1/2) m [ (1 + 2z_x²) ẋ² + (1 + 2z_y²) ẏ² + 2( z_x z_y + z_x z_y - z_x z_y ... ) ẋ ẏ ] ?\n\nWait, no. There is a standard formula for the kinetic energy when moving on a surface. If the surface is z = f(x, y), then the velocity components are:\n\nv_x, v_y, and v_z = ∂f/∂x v_x + ∂f/∂y v_y.\n\nTherefore, the speed squared is:\n\nv² = v_x² + v_y² + ( ∂f/∂x v_x + ∂f/∂y v_y )²\n\nTherefore, expanding this:\n\nv² = v_x² + v_y² + ( (∂f/∂x)^2 v_x² + 2 ∂f/∂x ∂f/∂y v_x v_y + (∂f/∂y)^2 v_y² )\n\nTherefore, grouping terms:\n\nv² = [1 + (∂f/∂x)^2 ] v_x² + [1 + (∂f/∂y)^2 ] v_y² + 2 [ ∂f/∂x ∂f/∂y ] v_x v_y\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy is:\n\nT = (1/2) m v² = (1/2) m [ (1 + (∂f/∂x)^2 ) ẋ² + (1 + (∂f/∂y)^2 ) ẏ² + 2 ∂f/∂x ∂f/∂y ẋ ẏ ]\n\nBut since we are at the equilibrium point (x, y) = (0, 0), we need to evaluate the derivatives at that point.\n\nGiven f(x, y) = x² + y² - x y.\n\nCompute ∂f/∂x = 2x - y. At (0, 0), this is 0.\n\nSimilarly, ∂f/∂y = 2y - x. At (0, 0), this is 0.\n\nTherefore, at the equilibrium point, the derivatives are zero. Therefore, the kinetic energy reduces to:\n\nT = (1/2) m [ (1 + 0) ẋ² + (1 + 0) ẏ² + 0 ] = (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²)\n\nTherefore, confirming our earlier result that for small oscillations around (0,0), the vertical component of velocity does not contribute to the kinetic energy at the leading order. Therefore, our initial approximation was correct. Therefore, the equations of motion are indeed:\n\nẍ = -2g x + g y\n\nÿ = g x - 2g y\n\nTherefore, the unit inconsistency must be due to something else. Let me check again.\n\nLet me consider the potential energy. If z = x² + y² - x y, and assuming x and y are in meters, then z is in meters squared, which is inconsistent. Therefore, unless there is a constant with units of 1/meter multiplying the right-hand side. However, since the problem statement does not provide such a constant, perhaps we are to assume that the equation is dimensionless or in some unit system where x, y, z are dimensionless. In that case, g would have units of [energy]/[mass], which is acceleration. However, if x and y are dimensionless, then z is dimensionless, and the potential energy U = m g z would have units of m g, where z is dimensionless, so g must have units of [energy]/[mass], which is acceleration. Therefore, if we take x and y as dimensionless, then the equations are consistent.\n\nTherefore, proceeding formally, our earlier result for frequencies is ω = sqrt(g) and ω = sqrt(3g). But since frequencies should have units of 1/time, and g has units of length/time², this suggests that there is a missing length scale. Therefore, likely there is an error in the formulation.\n\nWait, another thought: The potential energy is U = m g z, but z is given as x² + y² - x y. If we are to have z in meters, then x and y must be in meters, but then x² is in meters squared, which is not meters. Therefore, there must be a missing coefficient. Perhaps the surface is actually z = a (x² + y² - x y), where a is a constant with units of 1/length. For example, if a has units of 1/m, then z would be in meters if x and y are in meters.\n\nAssuming that, let's redefine z = a (x² + y² - x y), where a has units 1/length. Then, the potential energy is U = m g z = m g a (x² + y² - x y). Then, the equations of motion would be:\n\nFrom Lagrangian L = T - U, with T = (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²) (as before, since the vertical kinetic energy is negligible for small oscillations), and U = m g a (x² + y² - x y).\n\nThen, equations of motion:\n\nm ẍ = - ∂U/∂x = - m g a (2x - y)\n\n=> ẍ = -g a (2x - y)\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\nÿ = -g a (2y - x)\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\nẍ = -2 g a x + g a y\n\nÿ = g a x - 2 g a y\n\nThen, assuming solutions of the form x = A e^{i ω t}, y = B e^{i ω t}, we get:\n\n-ω² A = -2 g a A + g a B => (-ω² + 2 g a) A - g a B = 0\n\n-ω² B = g a A - 2 g a B => -g a A + (-ω² + 2 g a) B = 0\n\nWhich is the same system as before, with g replaced by g a. Therefore, determinant:\n\n[(-ω² + 2 g a)^2 - (g a)^2] = 0 => same as before, leading to ω² = 3 g a or ω² = g a. Therefore, frequencies are sqrt(g a) and sqrt(3 g a). Now, units make sense if a has units of 1/length, then g a has units (length/time²) * (1/length) = 1/time², so sqrt(g a) has units 1/time, which is correct for angular frequency.\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not mention the constant a. Therefore, likely the problem assumes that the equation z = x² + y² - x y is given in a unit system where a = 1, but then z would have units of length squared. This inconsistency suggests that there might be a typo in the problem, or perhaps it's intended to ignore units and just proceed formally.\n\nAssuming that the problem expects us to proceed formally, then the normal frequencies are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g), but with the caveat that there is a missing constant. However, given that the problem says \"determine the normal frequencies\", and given that in similar physics problems, often such surfaces are given with an appropriate coefficient to make the units work, but since it's not specified here, maybe we are to assume that the equation is correct as given and that the frequencies are expressed in terms of g, even if the units are inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the equations of motion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption to neglect the vertical kinetic energy is incorrect. Let me try including it. Earlier, I saw that at the equilibrium point, the vertical kinetic energy does not contribute at leading order, but perhaps for the potential energy, we need to consider the constraint force?\n\nWait, another approach: Since the particle is constrained to move on the surface z = x² + y² - x y, we can use Lagrange multipliers to account for the constraint. However, for small oscillations, maybe we can still proceed.\n\nThe Lagrangian without constraints is T - U, but with the constraint z = x² + y² - x y. However, since we are dealing with small oscillations, maybe we can use the constraint to express z in terms of x and y, and then write the Lagrangian in terms of x and y only, as we did before. But we saw that the vertical kinetic energy is negligible for small oscillations. However, if we want to be precise, let's include it.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nT = (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + ((2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )² ]\n\nBut for small x and y, we can expand this kinetic energy up to quadratic terms. As we saw, the expansion gives terms that are quadratic in velocities and quadratic in coordinates. However, in the harmonic approximation, we need the kinetic energy to be a quadratic form in velocities, with coefficients that may depend on coordinates. However, since we are expanding around x = 0, y = 0, we can expand T in Taylor series around x=0, y=0, keeping terms up to quadratic in coordinates and velocities.\n\nLet me denote the kinetic energy as:\n\nT = T0 + T1 + T2 + ..., where T0 is the kinetic energy at x=y=0, T1 is linear in x and y, and T2 is quadratic in x and y and velocities.\n\nSince at x=y=0, the velocity in z is zero, T0 = (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²). T1 would involve terms linear in x and y, which vanish because the first derivatives of the kinetic energy with respect to x and y at equilibrium are zero. T2 includes terms quadratic in x and y multiplied by velocities squared and cross terms.\n\nHowever, in the harmonic approximation, we usually assume that the kinetic energy is a quadratic form in velocities, with constant coefficients, and the potential energy is a quadratic form in coordinates. However, here, the kinetic energy has terms that mix coordinates and velocities. Therefore, the equations of motion will have terms involving products of coordinates and accelerations?\n\nWait, no. The Lagrangian is T - U, and when we derive the equations of motion, we take derivatives with respect to ẋ and ẋ, etc. Let me try to compute the equations of motion properly including the vertical kinetic energy.\n\nLet me write the Lagrangian as:\n\nL = (1/2) m [ ẋ² + ẏ² + ((2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )² ] - m g (x² + y² - x y)\n\nNow, let's expand the square term in the kinetic energy up to quadratic terms in x and y. As before, expanding ((2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )²:\n\n= (2x ẋ - y ẋ + 2y ẏ - x ẏ )² \n\nExpanding this, keeping terms up to quadratic in x and y:\n\nThe square of this expression will have terms like (2x ẋ)^2, (-y ẋ)^2, (2y ẏ)^2, (-x ẏ)^2, cross terms like 2*(2x ẋ)(-y ẋ), 2*(2x ẋ)(2y ẏ), etc. But since we are keeping only up to quadratic in x and y, note that terms like (2x ẋ)^2 are quadratic in x and quadratic in velocity, which is quartic overall and should be neglected. Similarly for others. The only terms that are quadratic in coordinates and velocities are those with one coordinate and one velocity squared or cross terms. Wait, no, actually, if we consider that x and y are small, then the product of x and velocity squared is small, but if we are keeping terms up to quadratic in coordinates and velocities, then we need to keep terms that are quadratic in velocities (which are already present) and terms that are quadratic in coordinates multiplied by constants, and terms that are linear in coordinates multiplied by linear in velocities? No, in the harmonic approximation, we usually keep terms up to quadratic in coordinates and velocities. However, terms that are products of coordinates and velocities are considered as quadratic in the generalized coordinates and velocities if we consider x and y as generalized coordinates.\n\nWait, actually, in the Lagrangian formalism, the kinetic energy can have terms that are products of coordinates and velocities, but for small oscillations, we usually assume that the kinetic energy is a homogeneous quadratic form in velocities, with coefficients that may depend on coordinates. However, when expanding around equilibrium, we can expand the kinetic energy in Taylor series, keeping terms up to quadratic in coordinates and velocities.\n\nTherefore, let's proceed to expand the kinetic energy up to quadratic terms. Let me denote the square term as:\n\n((2x - y) ẋ + (2y - x) ẏ )² = [ (2x ẋ - y ẋ + 2y ẏ - x ẏ ) ]² \n\nExpanding this:\n\n= (2x ẋ)^2 + (-y ẋ)^2 + (2y ẏ)^2 + (-x ẏ)^2 + 2*(2x ẋ)(-y ẋ) + 2*(2x ẋ)(2y ẏ) + 2*(2x ẋ)(-x ẏ) + 2*(-y ẋ)(2y ẏ) + 2*(-y ẋ)(-x ẏ) + 2*(2y ẏ)(-x ẏ)\n\nNow, let's analyze each term:\n\n1. (2x ẋ)^2 = 4x² ẋ² → quartic, neglect\n2. (-y ẋ)^2 = y² ẋ² → quartic, neglect\n3. (2y ẏ)^2 = 4y² ẏ² → quartic, neglect\n4. (-x ẏ)^2 = x² ẏ² → quartic, neglect\n5. 2*(2x ẋ)(-y ẋ) = -4x y ẋ² → quadratic in x,y and quadratic in velocity, so total quartic, neglect\n6. 2*(2x ẋ)(2y ẏ) = 8x y ẋ ẏ → quartic, neglect\n7. 2*(2x ẋ)(-x ẏ) = -4x² ẋ ẏ → quartic, neglect\n8. 2*(-y ẋ)(2y ẏ) = -4y² ẋ ẏ → quartic, neglect\n9. 2*(-y ẋ)(-x ẏ) = 4x y ẋ ẏ → quartic, neglect\n10. 2*(2y ẏ)(-x ẏ) = -4x y ẏ² → quartic, neglect\n\nTherefore, all terms are quartic or higher, so they can be neglected in the harmonic approximation. Therefore, the kinetic energy up to quadratic terms is indeed T = (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²), confirming our previous result. Therefore, the equations of motion are indeed:\n\nẍ = -2g x + g y\n\nÿ = g x - 2g y\n\nSo the unit inconsistency must be due to the problem's formulation. Given that, and assuming that the problem expects an answer in terms of g, even if the units are inconsistent, we can proceed.\n\nTherefore, solving the eigenvalue problem, we found frequencies squared of g and 3g, so frequencies are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g). But to express frequencies properly, we need to have units of 1/time. If we assume that there is an implicit length scale, say, the surface is z = (1/L)(x² + y² - x y), where L is a length, then g/L would have units of 1/time², so frequencies would be sqrt(g/L) and sqrt(3g/L). However, since the problem didn't specify such a length scale, it's unclear. \n\nBut looking back at the problem statement: \"A particle with mass m moves under the influence of gravity on a smooth surface described by the equation z = x² + y² - x y where the z axis points vertically upward.\" It doesn't mention any specific units or scaling. In physics problems, when such equations are given, it's often assumed that the coefficients are dimensionless, and the units are consistent within the context of the problem. For example, if x and y are in meters, then the equation would have to include a coefficient with units of 1/m to make z in meters. Since it's not included, it's possible that the problem is purely mathematical, and we are to treat x, y, z as dimensionless quantities, with g having units of [energy]/[mass], which is acceleration. In that case, the frequencies would have units of sqrt(acceleration), which is not standard, but perhaps in the context of the problem, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in my derivation. Let me check once more.\n\nThe potential energy is U = m g z = m g (x² + y² - x y). The force is -∇U = -m g (2x - y, 2y - x, ...). The equations of motion are then m ẍ = -m g (2x - y), etc. Dividing by m, we get ẍ = -g (2x - y). If we assume that x and y are dimensionless, then g has units of acceleration, and the right-hand side has units of acceleration, matching the left-hand side. Therefore, if x and y are dimensionless, then z is dimensionless, and g has units of acceleration. In this case, the frequencies ω have units of sqrt(acceleration), which is not standard. However, if we introduce a characteristic length scale, say, L, such that the actual coordinates are x' = x/L, y' = y/L, z' = z/L, then the equation becomes z' = (x'^2 + y'^2 - x'y') / L. Then, the potential energy is U = m g z' L = m g L (x'^2 + y'^2 - x'y'), and the equations of motion become ẍ' = - (g L)(2x' - y'), etc. In this case, the frequencies would be sqrt(g L) and sqrt(3g L), which have units of 1/time, as expected.\n\nHowever, since the problem does not provide such a length scale, it's ambiguous. Given that the problem is likely from a physics textbook or exam, and such problems typically include the necessary constants, it's possible that there is a typo or missing constant in the surface equation. However, given the problem as stated, we can only proceed formally.\n\nAssuming that the problem expects an answer in terms of g, and that the frequencies are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g), even though the units are inconsistent, or that there is an implicit length scale, we can present these as the normal frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equations of motion. Let me check with dimensional analysis assuming that x and y have units of length.\n\nLet me assume that x and y have units of meters, and z has units of meters. Then, the equation z = x² + y² - x y requires that x² has units of meters, so x must have units of sqrt(meters), which is non-standard. To resolve this, let's assume that the surface equation is actually z = k(x² + y² - x y), where k has units of 1/meters. Then, z has units of meters. Then, the potential energy is U = m g z = m g k(x² + y² - x y). The equations of motion are then:\n\nẍ = -2gk x + gk y\n\nÿ = gk x - 2gk y\n\nThen, the frequencies are sqrt(2gk - gk) ? Wait, solving the eigenvalue problem as before, we get ω² = gk and 3gk, so frequencies are sqrt(gk) and sqrt(3gk). If k has units of 1/length, then gk has units of acceleration/length * length = acceleration? No, g has units of acceleration (m/s²), k has units 1/length (1/m), so gk has units (m/s²)/m = 1/s², which is correct for ω². Therefore, frequencies have units of 1/s, as required. Therefore, the correct frequencies are sqrt(gk) and sqrt(3gk). However, since the problem didn't specify k, we cannot compute numerical values. But since the problem says \"determine the normal frequencies\", and the surface is given as z = x² + y² - x y, it's likely that the problem assumes that k = 1, and we should express the frequencies in terms of g, even though strictly speaking, the units are inconsistent. Alternatively, the problem may have a typo, and the surface should be z = a(x² + y² - x y), with a having appropriate units.\n\nGiven that, and since the problem is likely expecting an answer in terms of g, I will proceed with the frequencies as sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g), noting that there is an implicit constant with units to make the expression dimensionally consistent.\n\nTherefore, the normal frequencies of small oscillations are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g). However, to express this properly, if we assume that the surface equation has an implicit constant to make z have units of length, then the frequencies would be sqrt(3g/a) and sqrt(g/a), where a is the constant from the surface equation. But since it's not specified, we can only give the answer as sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g), assuming that the necessary constants are absorbed into g or the coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the potential energy. Let me check once more. The potential energy is U = m g z. If the surface is z = x² + y² - x y, then the potential energy is U = m g (x² + y² - x y). The minimum is at (0,0), and the curvature is given by the Hessian matrix we computed earlier, which was [[2, -1], [-1, 2]]. The potential energy for small oscillations is then U ≈ (1/2) m g [2x² - 2x y + 2y²] = m g (x² + y² - x y), which is consistent. Therefore, the potential energy matrix is K = m g [[2, -1], [-1, 2]]. The kinetic energy matrix, assuming T = (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²), is T = (1/2) m [ẋ² + ẏ²], so the mass matrix M is m [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. \n\nIn the theory of small oscillations, the normal frequencies are given by solving det(K - ω² M) = 0. Wait, no, the general equation is that for the eigenvalue problem, we have (K - ω² M) A = 0. Therefore, the determinant |K - ω² M| = 0.\n\nGiven that, let's write K and M.\n\nK is the potential energy matrix, which is m g times [[2, -1], [-1, 2]].\n\nWait, no. The potential energy is U = (1/2) k_xx x² + (1/2) k_yy y² + k_xy x y, so the matrix K is [[k_xx, k_xy], [k_xy, k_yy]]. In our case, U = m g (x² + y² - x y) = (1/2) m g (2x² + 2y² - 2x y), so the matrix K is m g [[2, -1], [-1, 2]].\n\nThe kinetic energy is T = (1/2) m (ẋ² + ẏ²), so the mass matrix M is m [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalue equation is |K - ω² M| = 0:\n\n| m g [[2, -1], [-1, 2]] - ω² m [[1, 0], [0, 1]] | = 0\n\nFactor out m:\n\nm² | g [[2, -1], [-1, 2]] - ω² [[1, 0], [0, 1]] | = 0\n\nSo we can ignore the m² and solve:\n\n| g*[[2, -1], [-1, 2]] - ω² [[1, 0], [0, 1]] | = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n| [2g - ω², -g] \n\n[-g, 2g - ω²] | = 0\n\nWhich is the same determinant as before, leading to (2g - ω²)^2 - g² = 0 => ω² = g or 3g.\n\nTherefore, frequencies are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g). So this confirms our earlier result. Given that, and given that in the context of the problem, we are to provide the frequencies in terms of g, despite the unit inconsistency, the answer is these two frequencies.\n\nTherefore, the normal frequencies are ω = sqrt(g) and ω = sqrt(3g). However, to write it properly, since frequencies are usually denoted with a positive number, and g is acceleration, we can present them as sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g), assuming that appropriate constants are included in the surface equation to make the units consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the two normal frequencies: sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g). But let me check if there is any other consideration.\n\nWait, another thought: In the potential energy matrix, the curvature is given by the Hessian of U, which we computed earlier as [[2, -1], [-1, 2]] multiplied by m g. In the equations of motion, the potential energy matrix is K = m g [[2, -1], [-1, 2]], and the mass matrix is M = m [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. Therefore, the equation is:\n\nM q'' + K q = 0, where q is the vector [x, y]^T.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalue equation is K q = ω² M q, so ω² = eigenvalues of K M^{-1}.\n\nSince K = m g [[2, -1], [-1, 2]] and M = m [[1, 0], [0, 1]], then K M^{-1} = [[2g, -g], [-g, 2g]], which is what we had before. Therefore, solving gives ω² = g and 3g.\n\nYes, this is correct. Therefore, the normal frequencies are sqrt(g) and sqrt(3g). Given that, and assuming the problem is formulated in a way that units are consistent (perhaps with an implicit constant in the surface equation), this is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe normal frequencies of small oscillations are $\\boxed{\\sqrt{g}}$ and $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3g}}$.\n</think>"}
