Let me start by recalling what I know about muonic atoms and their lifetimes. \n\nFirst, a muon is like a heavier version of an electron, with a mass of 105.7 MeV. Compared to an electron, which has a mass of about 0.511 MeV, the muon is roughly 207 times heavier. Because of this, when a muon is captured by a nucleus, it forms a hydrogen-like atom similar to how an electron does, but the muon's orbit is much closer to the nucleus due to its larger mass. \n\nThe problem mentions that the lifetime of the 3d state in hydrogen is 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ seconds, and I need to find the corresponding lifetime for the muonic atom in the same 3d state but with an aluminum nucleus (Z=13). \n\nHmm, so why would the lifetime be different? Well, the lifetime of an excited state in an atom is related to the transition probability between that state and lower energy states. The transition probability, in turn, depends on factors like the dipole moment and the energy difference between the states. \n\nI remember that the transition rate (which is the inverse of the lifetime) is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element and the cube of the transition frequency. The formula for the spontaneous emission rate is given by the Einstein A coefficient:\n\nA = ( (e² ω³ ) / (3πε₀ ħ c³) ) |<f| r |i>|²\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to relate the lifetime of the muonic atom to that of hydrogen. Since the muonic atom is similar to hydrogen but with a muon instead of an electron, maybe the lifetime scales in some way with the mass of the particle?\n\nLet me think. In hydrogen-like atoms, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = - (Z² α² m c²) / (2n²)\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant, m is the mass of the particle (electron or muon), c is the speed of light, Z is the atomic number, and n is the principal quantum number. \n\nSo for the energy difference between the 3d (which is n=3, l=2) state and a lower state, say 2p or 1s, the energy difference would be proportional to Z² m. Therefore, the transition frequency ω would be proportional to Z² m / ħ, since ω = ΔE / ħ.\n\nBut the transition rate A is proportional to ω³ |<f| r |i>|². So if I can figure out how the dipole matrix element |<f| r |i>| scales with the mass, then I can find how A scales, and thus how the lifetime τ (which is 1/A) scales.\n\nHowever, the dipole matrix element involves the position operator r. In hydrogen-like atoms, the radius of the orbit is inversely proportional to the mass. The Bohr radius for a hydrogen-like atom is a₀' = ħ² / (Z m e²) * 4πε₀. So for a muon, the radius would be smaller by a factor of m_μ / m_e. Therefore, r scales as 1/m.\n\nTherefore, |<f| r |i>|² would scale as 1/m².\n\nPutting this together, A ∝ ω³ * (1/m²). And since ω ∝ Z² m / ħ, then ω³ ∝ Z^6 m³ / ħ³. Therefore, combining these:\n\nA ∝ (Z^6 m³ / ħ³) * (1/m²) ) = Z^6 m / ħ³.\n\nTherefore, A ∝ Z^6 m.\n\nTherefore, the transition rate A is proportional to Z^6 multiplied by the mass of the particle. Therefore, the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Z^6 m.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If A ∝ Z^6 m, then τ ∝ 1/(Z^6 m). Therefore, if I have a muonic atom with Z=13 and mass m_μ, compared to hydrogen with Z=1 and mass m_e, then:\n\nτ_muon / τ_hydrogen = [Z_H^6 m_H] / [Z_Al^6 m_muon] \n\nBut since τ is inversely proportional to A, so τ ∝ 1/A, and A ∝ Z^6 m, so τ ∝ 1/(Z^6 m). Therefore:\n\nτ_muon = τ_H * (Z_H / Z_Al)^6 * (m_e / m_muon)\n\nBecause τ_muon / τ_H = (Z_H^6 m_H) / (Z_Al^6 m_muon) ) = [ (1/13)^6 ] * [ m_e / m_muon ]\n\nGiven that Z_H is 1, and m_H here refers to the mass of the particle in hydrogen, which is m_e. \n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\nτ_muon = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × (1/13)^6 × (m_e / m_muon)\n\nNow, m_muon is 105.7 MeV/c², and m_e is 0.511 MeV/c². Therefore, m_e / m_muon ≈ 0.511 / 105.7 ≈ 0.00483.\n\nCalculating (1/13)^6 first. Let's compute 13^6:\n\n13² = 169\n\n13³ = 169 × 13 = 2197\n\n13^6 = (13³)² = 2197². Let me calculate that:\n\n2197 × 2197. Hmm, 2000² = 4,000,000. Then, 2197 is 2000 + 197. So (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So:\n\n(2000 + 197)^2 = 2000² + 2*2000*197 + 197²\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4,000,000\n\nSecond term: 2 * 2000 * 197 = 4000 * 197 = Let's compute 4000*200 = 800,000 minus 4000*3 = 12,000, so 800,000 - 12,000 = 788,000\n\nThird term: 197². Let me compute 200² - 2*200*3 + 3² = 40,000 - 1200 + 9 = 38,809. Wait, because (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 197 is 200 - 3, so yes:\n\n(200 - 3)^2 = 200² - 2*200*3 + 3² = 40,000 - 1,200 + 9 = 38,809.\n\nTherefore total:\n\n4,000,000 + 788,000 + 38,809 = 4,826,809.\n\nTherefore, 13^6 = 4,826,809, so (1/13)^6 ≈ 1 / 4,826,809 ≈ 2.072 × 10⁻⁷.\n\nLet me check with calculator approximation:\n\nWell, 13^6 is 4826809. Let me confirm with another approach. 13^4 is 13² * 13² = 169 * 169 = 28,561. Then 13^5 = 28,561 * 13 = let's compute 28,561*10 + 28,561*3 = 285,610 + 85,683 = 371,293. Then 13^6 = 371,293 * 13. Let me compute that:\n\n371,293 * 10 = 3,712,930\n\n371,293 * 3 = 1,113,879\n\nAdding together: 3,712,930 + 1,113,879 = 4,826,809. Yes, correct. So (1/13)^6 ≈ 1 / 4.826809 × 10^6 ≈ 2.072 × 10⁻⁷.\n\nSo multiplying that by m_e / m_muon ≈ 0.00483 gives:\n\n2.072 × 10⁻⁷ * 0.00483 ≈ Let's compute 2.072 * 0.00483 first.\n\n2 * 0.00483 = 0.00966\n\n0.072 * 0.00483 ≈ 0.00034776\n\nTotal ≈ 0.00966 + 0.00034776 ≈ 0.01000776\n\nSo approximately 0.01000776 × 10⁻⁷ = 1.000776 × 10⁻⁹.\n\nTherefore, τ_muon ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s * 1.000776 × 10⁻⁹ ≈ Wait, no. Wait, τ_muon = τ_H * (Z_H / Z_Al)^6 * (m_e / m_muon) ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s * 2.072 × 10⁻⁷ * 0.00483 ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ * 1.00 × 10⁻⁹ ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁷ s? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me recast.\n\nWait, earlier I said τ_muon = τ_H * (Z_H^6 m_H) / (Z_Al^6 m_muon). So τ_muon = τ_H * (1^6 / 13^6) * (m_e / m_muon). So τ_muon = 1.6e-8 s * (1 / 4.8268e6) * (0.511 / 105.7). \n\nSo first compute 1 / 4.8268e6 ≈ 2.072e-7, then multiply by 0.511 / 105.7 ≈ 0.00483, so 2.072e-7 * 0.00483 ≈ approx 1.0e-9, as above. Then multiply by 1.6e-8 s:\n\nτ_muon ≈ 1.6e-8 s * 1.0e-9 ≈ 1.6e-17 s? That seems extremely short. Is that possible?\n\nWait, but maybe my scaling is wrong. Let me think again. Maybe I made an error in the scaling of the transition rate.\n\nLet me go back. The transition rate A is proportional to ω³ |<d>|², where <d> is the dipole matrix element. The dipole matrix element is e<r>, so proportional to e<r>. But in hydrogen-like atoms, the Bohr radius is a₀' = a₀ * m_e / (Z m), where m is the mass of the particle (muon or electron). Therefore, <r> scales as a₀' ~ 1/(Z m). Therefore, |<d>|² scales as (1/(Z m))². \n\nThe transition frequency ω is proportional to ΔE / ħ. The energy levels are proportional to Z² m, so ΔE ~ Z² m. Therefore, ω ~ Z² m / ħ. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together, A ∝ ω³ |<d>|² ~ (Z² m / ħ)^3 * (1/(Z² m²)) ) = Z^6 m³ / ħ³ * 1/(Z² m²) ) = Z^4 m / ħ³. \n\nTherefore, A ∝ Z^4 m. Therefore, the transition rate scales with Z^4 times mass. Therefore, the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Z^4 m. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought A ∝ Z^6 m, but now I get A ∝ Z^4 m. Which is correct?\n\nLet me check again.\n\nEnergy levels for hydrogen-like atom:\n\nE_n = - (Z² α² m c²) / (2n²)\n\nSo the energy difference between two levels, say n and n', is ΔE ≈ Z² α² m c² (1/(2n'²) - 1/(2n²)) ≈ Z² α² m c² * something. Therefore, ΔE ∝ Z² m. Therefore, ω = ΔE / ħ ∝ Z² m / ħ.\n\nThe dipole matrix element <d> = e <r>. The expectation value of r in hydrogen-like atom scales as a₀' = a₀ * m_e / (Z m). Since for the electron, a₀ = 4πε₀ ħ² / (m_e e²). For the muon, replacing m_e with m_muon, and Z with Z, so a₀' = a₀ * m_e / (Z m_muon). Therefore, <r> scales as 1/(Z m). Therefore, |<d>|² scales as 1/(Z² m²).\n\nTherefore, A ∝ ω³ |<d>|² ∝ (Z² m)^3 / ħ³ * 1/(Z² m²) ) = Z^6 m³ / ( ħ³ Z² m² ) ) = Z^4 m / ħ³. Therefore, A ∝ Z^4 m. Therefore, τ ∝ 1/(Z^4 m). \n\nSo my previous conclusion that A ∝ Z^6 m was wrong. The correct scaling is A ∝ Z^4 m. Therefore, the lifetime τ ∝ 1/(Z^4 m). Therefore, τ_muon / τ_H = τ_muon / τ_H = (Z_H / Z_Al)^4 * (m_e / m_muon). \n\nTherefore, τ_muon = τ_H * (1/13)^4 * (m_e / m_muon). \n\nOkay, so that's different from before. So I had a mistake in the exponent of Z. Let me recalculate with this corrected scaling.\n\nSo τ_muon = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × (1/13)^4 × (m_e / m_muon)\n\nFirst compute (1/13)^4. 13^2 is 169, 13^4 is 169² = 28561. Therefore, 1/28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵. Let me compute it more accurately:\n\n1 / 28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵? Let's calculate 1 / 28561. Well, 1 / 28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵? Let's see:\n\n1 / 10,000 = 0.0001 = 1e-4\n\n1 / 28,561 ≈ approx 0.000035, which is 3.5 × 10⁻⁵. Yes, so approx 3.5 × 10⁻⁵.\n\nThen m_e / m_muon ≈ 0.511 / 105.7 ≈ 0.00483 as before. Therefore, multiplying these together:\n\n3.5 × 10⁻⁵ * 0.00483 ≈ 3.5 * 0.00483 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ approx 0.0169 × 10⁻⁵ = 1.69 × 10⁻⁷.\n\nTherefore, τ_muon ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s * 1.69 × 10⁻⁷ ≈ Let me compute 1.6 × 1.69 × 10⁻¹⁵ ≈ approx 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s? Wait:\n\nWait, 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ multiplied by 1.69 × 10⁻⁷ is:\n\n(1.6 × 1.69) × 10^(-8 -7) = approx 2.704 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. \n\nSo approximately 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds? That seems extremely short, but maybe that's correct? Let me check with more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1/13)^4:\n\n13^4 = 28561, so 1/28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ as above. Let me calculate it more accurately:\n\nDivide 1 by 28561:\n\nWell, 28561 × 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ = 28561 × 0.000035 ≈ 28561 × 3.5 / 10^5 ≈ 99,963.5 / 10^5 ≈ 0.999635 ≈ 1. So 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ is approximate. Let me compute 1 / 28561:\n\nUsing calculator steps:\n\nWell, 1 / 28561 ≈ 3.4999 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵. Let's take it as approximately 3.5 × 10⁻⁵.\n\nThen m_e / m_muon = 0.511 / 105.7 ≈ Let me calculate that more accurately:\n\n0.511 / 105.7 ≈ 0.511 / 105.7. Let me compute 0.511 ÷ 105.7:\n\nWell, 105.7 × 0.0048 = 105.7 × 0.004 + 105.7 × 0.0008 = 0.4228 + 0.08456 = 0.50736. Which is very close to 0.511. The difference is 0.511 - 0.50736 = 0.00364. So 0.00364 / 105.7 ≈ 0.0000344. Therefore, m_e / m_muon ≈ 0.0048 + 0.0000344 ≈ 0.0048344. So approx 0.004834.\n\nTherefore, multiplying 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ by 0.004834:\n\nFirst, 3.5 × 0.004834 ≈ 0.016919. Then multiply by 10⁻⁵:\n\n0.016919 × 10⁻⁵ = 1.6919 × 10⁻⁷.\n\nTherefore, τ_muon ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × 1.6919 × 10⁻⁷ ≈ Let me compute 1.6 × 1.6919 × 10⁻¹⁵.\n\nFirst, 1.6 × 1.6919 ≈ 1.6 × 1.69 ≈ 2.704. Therefore, τ_muon ≈ 2.704 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\nBut let me check if this scaling is correct. Another way to think about this is to recall that the lifetime of the muonic atom is affected by the transition probability, which depends on the same factors as the transition rate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a known relation for the lifetime scaling in hydrogen-like atoms. For example, in hydrogen, the lifetime depends on the transition probability, which is related to the square of the dipole matrix element and the cube of the frequency. \n\nAlternatively, since the muonic atom has a much smaller size, the transition frequency is much higher (because the energy levels are more widely spaced), leading to a higher transition rate and thus a shorter lifetime. \n\nGiven that Z=13 and the muon is 207 times heavier than the electron, the scaling seems to lead to a lifetime that is (1/13)^4 * (1/207) times the hydrogen lifetime. \n\nWait, τ ∝ 1/(Z^4 m). Therefore, τ_muon / τ_H = (Z_H / Z_Al)^4 * (m_e / m_muon). So with Z_H=1, Z_Al=13, m_muon=207 m_e. Therefore:\n\nτ_muon / τ_H = (1/13)^4 * (1/207) ≈ (1/28561) * (1/207) ≈ 1/(28561 * 207). Let me compute that denominator:\n\n28561 * 200 = 5,712,200\n\n28561 * 7 = 199,927\n\nTotal ≈ 5,712,200 + 199,927 ≈ 5,912,127. Therefore, approx 5.91 × 10^6. Therefore τ_muon ≈ τ_H / 5.91 × 10^6 ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ / 5.91 × 10^6 ≈ 1.6 / 5.91 × 10⁻¹⁴ ≈ approx 0.27 × 10⁻¹⁴ = 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. Which matches the previous result. \n\nSo according to this scaling, the lifetime is about 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there is another factor I missed. For example, in hydrogen, the 3d state decays to lower states, primarily to 2p and then to 1s. However, in a muonic atom with Z=13, the energy levels are much higher, so the transition from 3d might decay directly to 1s or other lower states. But does that affect the scaling? \n\nHowever, since we are scaling the transition rate based on general factors like Z and mass, which affect both the dipole matrix element and the transition frequency, perhaps the specific transition path doesn't affect the scaling as long as we are considering the same principal quantum numbers (like n=3 to lower n). Therefore, the scaling should still hold. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more precise formula for the lifetime of hydrogen-like atoms. For example, the lifetime τ is given by:\n\nτ = 1 / A,\n\nwhere A is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission. For hydrogen-like atoms, the transition rate A can be approximated by:\n\nA = (4 α ω³ |<r>|² ) / (3 c)\n\nBut regardless of the exact formula, the scaling we derived earlier should hold if we consider the dependencies on Z and m. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that for hydrogenic atoms, the lifetime scales as:\n\nτ ∝ (m / Z^4) * (a₀^3 / α^2)\n\nBut maybe I need to think in terms of the Bohr model. \n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for hydrogen, the lifetime of the 2p state is about 1.6 ns, which is similar to the 3d state given here. Wait, but the problem says the lifetime of the 3d state in hydrogen is 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ seconds, which is 16 ns? Wait, no: 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ seconds is 16 nanoseconds? Wait, 1e-8 seconds is 10 ns. So 1.6e-8 s is 16 ns? Wait, 1 ns is 1e-9 s. Therefore, 1e-8 s is 10 ns. Therefore, 1.6e-8 s is 16 ns. \n\nBut in reality, the lifetime of the 2p state in hydrogen is about 1.6 ns, and the 3d state is longer. Wait, but according to some references, the 3d state in hydrogen has a longer lifetime than the 2p state because it can only decay via magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole transitions, which are weaker than electric dipole transitions. However, in this problem, we are told that the lifetime of the 3d state in hydrogen is 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s (16 ns), so we have to take that as given. \n\nBut regardless, the scaling with Z and mass should still hold. Therefore, with the calculation above, τ_muon ≈ 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. \n\nBut let me check if there is a standard formula or if I can find a more precise derivation. \n\nThe transition rate A for electric dipole transitions is given by:\n\nA = ( (e^2 ω^3 ) / (3π ε₀ ħ c^3) ) |<f| r |i>|²\n\nBut in hydrogen-like atoms, the dipole matrix element can be calculated. For example, for a transition from n=3, l=2 (3d) to n=2, l=1 (2p), or to n=1, l=0 (1s). However, the dominant transition might be to n=2, but for the purposes of scaling, perhaps we can consider that the matrix element scales as discussed. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that in hydrogen-like atoms, the expectation value of r for a transition is proportional to a₀' = a₀ * m_e / (Z m). Therefore, |<r>|² scales as (a₀')² = (m_e / (Z m))² a₀². \n\nThe transition frequency ω is ΔE / ħ. The energy levels are E_n = - (Z² α² m c² ) / (2 n² ). Therefore, ΔE for a transition from n=3 to n=2 is roughly proportional to Z² m. Therefore, ω ∝ Z² m / ħ. \n\nTherefore, putting it into the formula for A:\n\nA ∝ ω³ |<r>|² ∝ (Z² m / ħ)^3 * (m_e² / (Z² m²) a₀² ) \n\nWait, let's do this step by step. \n\nLet me write A ∝ ω³ |<r>|². \n\nWe have:\n\nω ∝ ΔE / ħ ∝ (Z² m) / ħ \n\nAssuming ΔE ∝ Z² m (since E_n ∝ Z² m). \n\nAnd |<r>|² ∝ (a₀')² ∝ (m_e / (Z m))². \n\nTherefore:\n\nA ∝ [ (Z² m / ħ )³ ] * [ (m_e / (Z m))² ] \n\n= (Z^6 m³ / ħ³) * (m_e² / Z² m² )\n\n= Z^4 m m_e² / ħ³ \n\nTherefore, A ∝ Z^4 m. \n\nTherefore, since A ∝ Z^4 m, τ ∝ 1/(Z^4 m). \n\nTherefore, τ_muon / τ_H = τ_muon / τ_H = (Z_H / Z_Al)^4 * (m_e / m_muon). \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems consistent. Therefore, the lifetime is:\n\nτ_muon = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × (1/13)^4 × (m_e / m_muon) ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ × 0.00483 ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ × 1.69 × 10⁻⁷ ≈ 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. \n\nBut let me compute the exact numerical value more accurately. \n\nFirst, compute (1/13)^4:\n\n1/13 = 0.076923...\n\n(1/13)^2 = 1/169 ≈ 0.005917...\n\n(1/13)^4 = (1/169)^2 ≈ (0.005917)^2 ≈ 0.000035. Let me calculate more accurately:\n\n0.005917 * 0.005917:\n\nFirst compute 0.005 * 0.005 = 0.000025\n\nThen cross terms:\n\n0.005 * 0.000917 * 2 = 0.00000917\n\nThen 0.000917^2 ≈ negligible, ~ 8.4e-7. \n\nSo total approx 0.000025 + 0.00000917 ≈ 0.00003417. Therefore, (1/13)^4 ≈ 3.417 × 10⁻⁵.\n\nThen m_e / m_muon = 0.511 / 105.7 ≈ 0.004834. \n\nMultiply these two numbers:\n\n3.417 × 10⁻⁵ × 0.004834 ≈ \n\nFirst compute 3.417 × 0.004834 ≈ \n\nWell, 3 × 0.004834 = 0.014502\n\n0.417 × 0.004834 ≈ approx 0.002013\n\nTotal ≈ 0.014502 + 0.002013 ≈ 0.016515\n\nTherefore, 0.016515 × 10⁻⁵ = 1.6515 × 10⁻⁷.\n\nTherefore, τ_muon = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × 1.6515 × 10⁻⁷ ≈ \n\nMultiply 1.6 × 1.6515 ≈ 2.6424\n\nTherefore, τ_muon ≈ 2.6424 × 10^(-8 -7) = 2.6424 × 10⁻¹⁵ s ≈ 2.64 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds.\n\nSo approximately 2.6 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\nBut let me check with more precise numbers. Let's use exact values for (1/13)^4 and m_e/m_muon.\n\nFirst, (1/13)^4 = 1 / 28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵. Let me compute 1 / 28561 more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator (if I could), but since I can't, let me do a better approximation. \n\nWe know that 1/28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵. Let me compute 28561 × 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ = 28561 × 0.000035. \n\nAs before, that's 28561 × 3.5 / 100000. \n\nCalculate 28561 × 3.5:\n\nFirst, 28561 × 3 = 85,683\n\n28561 × 0.5 = 14,280.5\n\nTotal = 85,683 + 14,280.5 = 99,963.5\n\nTherefore, 99,963.5 / 100,000 ≈ 0.999635 ≈ 1. So 1 / 28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ is correct. Therefore, our previous calculation is okay. \n\nTherefore, with τ_muon ≈ 2.64 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. \n\nBut let me write the exact expression:\n\nτ_muon = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × [1 / 13⁴] × [m_e / m_muon]\n\nPlugging numbers:\n\n13⁴ = 28561\n\nm_e = 0.511 MeV/c²\n\nm_muon = 105.7 MeV/c²\n\nSo:\n\nτ_muon = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × (1 / 28561) × (0.511 / 105.7)\n\nCompute 0.511 / 105.7:\n\nAs before, ≈ 0.004834.\n\nCompute 1 / 28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵.\n\nMultiply all together:\n\n1.6 × 10⁻⁸ × 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ × 0.004834 ≈ 1.6 × 3.5 × 0.004834 × 10⁻¹³\n\nCalculate 1.6 × 3.5 = 5.6\n\nThen 5.6 × 0.004834 ≈ 5.6 × 0.0048 = 0.02688, plus 5.6 × 0.000034 ≈ 0.0001904, total ≈ 0.02707\n\nTherefore, τ_muon ≈ 0.02707 × 10⁻¹³ s = 2.707 × 10⁻¹⁵ s ≈ 2.71 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds.\n\nSo approximately 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\nBut let me check if there is any other factor. For example, does the lifetime depend on the atomic number in another way? For example, in some cases, the lifetime might depend on the screening or other effects, but since we're dealing with a hydrogen-like atom (muon and nucleus), there are no other electrons, so screening is not an issue. Therefore, the scaling should hold. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption that the lifetime scales as 1/(Z^4 m) is incorrect. Let me check a reference or think of another approach. \n\nIn the hydrogen atom, the spontaneous emission rate for electric dipole transitions is given by:\n\nA = \\frac{\\omega^3}{3\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar c^3} |\\langle \\mathbf{d} \\rangle|^2\n\nwhere ⟨d⟩ is the dipole matrix element. \n\nFor hydrogen-like atoms, the dipole matrix element ⟨d⟩ is proportional to the Bohr radius a₀', which scales as a₀' = a₀ * m_e / (Z m), where m is the mass of the particle (electron or muon). \n\nThe Bohr radius for hydrogen-like atoms is:\n\na₀' = \\frac{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{Z m e^2}\n\nTherefore, a₀' ∝ 1/(Z m). \n\nTherefore, ⟨d⟩ = e ⟨r⟩ ∝ e * a₀' ∝ e / (Z m). \n\nTherefore, |⟨d⟩|² ∝ 1/(Z² m²). \n\nThe transition frequency ω is given by ΔE / ħ. The energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are:\n\nE_n = - \\frac{Z² m e^4}{8 \\epsilon_0² h² n²} \n\nTherefore, ΔE ∝ Z² m. \n\nTherefore, ω ∝ ΔE / ħ ∝ Z² m / ħ. \n\nTherefore, ω³ ∝ Z^6 m³ / ħ³. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nA ∝ ω³ |⟨d⟩|² ∝ (Z^6 m³ / ħ³) * (1 / (Z² m²)) ) = Z^4 m / ħ³. \n\nTherefore, A ∝ Z^4 m. \n\nTherefore, τ = 1/A ∝ 1/(Z^4 m). \n\nTherefore, τ_muon / τ_H = (Z_H / Z_Al)^4 * (m_e / m_muon). \n\nThis confirms our previous result. Therefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nThus, τ_muon ≈ 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\nBut let me check if the initial value given for the hydrogen 3d state lifetime is correct. The problem states that the lifetime of the 3d state in hydrogen is 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ seconds. Let me check with known data. \n\nIn reality, the lifetime of the 2p state in hydrogen is about 1.6 nanoseconds (1.6 × 10⁻⁹ s). The 3d state has a longer lifetime because it can only decay via magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole transitions, which are weaker. For example, the 3d state in hydrogen has a lifetime of about 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ seconds (16 nanoseconds), which matches the problem's given value. So the given value is correct. \n\nGiven that, our calculation seems valid. Therefore, the lifetime of the muonic atom in the 3d state is approximately 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\nBut let me write the exact expression with precise numbers:\n\nτ_muon = τ_H * (1/13)^4 * (m_e / m_muon)\n\nGiven:\n\nτ_H = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s\n\nZ = 13\n\nm_muon = 105.7 MeV/c²\n\nm_e = 0.511 MeV/c²\n\nCalculating:\n\nFirst compute (1/13)^4 = 1 / 28561 ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻⁵\n\nThen compute m_e / m_muon = 0.511 / 105.7 ≈ 0.004834\n\nMultiply these two: 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ × 0.004834 ≈ 1.69 × 10⁻⁷\n\nMultiply by τ_H: 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ × 1.69 × 10⁻⁷ = 2.704 × 10⁻¹⁵ s\n\nSo rounding to two significant figures (since the given lifetime is two significant figures), it would be 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. However, the given lifetime is 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s (two decimal places), but maybe we should carry more precise calculations. \n\nLet me do more precise calculation of (1/13)^4 * (m_e / m_muon):\n\nFirst, calculate 1/13^4:\n\n1/13^4 = 1 / 28561 ≈ 3.49996 × 10⁻⁵ (exact value is 1/28561 ≈ 3.49996 × 10⁻⁵)\n\nThen m_e / m_muon = 0.511 / 105.7 ≈ Let me compute this division more accurately:\n\nDivide 0.511 by 105.7:\n\nLet me write 0.511 / 105.7 = ?\n\nLet me compute 105.7 × 0.0048 = 0.50736 as before. \n\nThe difference between 0.511 and 0.50736 is 0.00364. \n\nNow, compute how much more than 0.0048 is needed to reach 0.511.\n\nLet me denote x = 0.0048 + Δx, such that 105.7 * x = 0.511.\n\nWe have 105.7 * Δx = 0.00364 => Δx = 0.00364 / 105.7 ≈ 0.00003443.\n\nTherefore, x ≈ 0.0048 + 0.00003443 ≈ 0.00483443.\n\nTherefore, m_e/m_muon ≈ 0.00483443.\n\nNow multiply by 3.49996 × 10⁻⁵:\n\n3.49996 × 10⁻⁵ × 0.00483443 ≈ \n\nFirst compute 3.49996 × 0.00483443 × 10⁻⁵.\n\nCalculate 3.49996 × 0.00483443:\n\nLet me approximate this multiplication:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n3 × 0.00483443 = 0.01450329\n\n0.49996 × 0.00483443 ≈ Let's approximate 0.5 × 0.00483443 = 0.002417215, subtract 0.0000004 × 0.00483443 ≈ negligible. So approx 0.002417215.\n\nTotal ≈ 0.01450329 + 0.002417215 ≈ 0.0169205.\n\nTherefore, 0.0169205 × 10⁻⁵ = 1.69205 × 10⁻⁷.\n\nThen multiply by τ_H = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s:\n\nτ_muon = 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s × 1.69205 × 10⁻⁷ ≈ \n\nMultiply 1.6 × 1.69205 = approx 2.70728\n\nTherefore, τ_muon ≈ 2.70728 × 10⁻¹⁵ s ≈ 2.71 × 10⁻¹⁵ s.\n\nSo, approximately 2.71 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\nTo express this with appropriate significant figures, since the given lifetime of hydrogen's 3d state is 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s (two significant figures), and the other values (Z=13, m_muon=105.7 MeV, m_e=0.511 MeV) are given with more precision, we can keep two significant figures for the final answer. Therefore, τ_muon ≈ 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. \n\nBut let me check if the problem expects an exact calculation with given numbers. For example, if Z=13 is exact, m_muon is given as 105.7 MeV (four significant figures), and m_e is 0.511 MeV (three significant figures). The given lifetime is 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s (two significant figures). Therefore, the limiting factor is the two significant figures from the hydrogen lifetime. Therefore, the answer should be given with two significant figures: 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s rounds to 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵, which is two decimal places but three significant figures. Wait, 2.7 is two significant figures. Yes, because 1.6 has two, so the result should have two. \n\nTherefore, τ_muon ≈ 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. \n\nBut let me check if I made any miscalculations in exponents. \n\nOriginal calculation:\n\nτ_muon = τ_H * (1/13)^4 * (m_e / m_muon)\n\n= 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ s * (1/28561) * (0.511 / 105.7)\n\n≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ * 3.5 × 10⁻⁵ * 0.00483 ≈ 1.6 × 3.5 × 0.00483 × 10⁻¹³ ≈ 0.027 × 10⁻¹³ = 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ s. Correct. \n\nYes, so the final answer is approximately 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\nTherefore, the lifetime of the muonic atom in the 3d state is about 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe lifetime of the muonic atom in the 3d state is \\boxed{2.7 \\times 10^{-15}} seconds.\n</think>"}
