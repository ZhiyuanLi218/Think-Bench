The options are given as (A) J/s, (B) m, (C) J·m, and (D) m/s. Let me start by recalling what each of these constants represents and their units.\n\nFirst, Planck's constant h has units of J·s, right? The problem statement already gives that h is 6.626×10^-34 J·s. Then, the speed of light c has units of meters per second, which is m/s. The electron mass m_e is in kilograms, since mass in SI units is measured in kg. Wait, but I need to make sure about the exact units for each.\n\nLet me write down the units for each quantity:\n\n- h: J·s. But I should remember that a joule is a derived unit. Let me break it down. 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². So h has units kg·m²/s² · s = kg·m²/s.\n\n- m_e: mass, so kg.\n\n- c: speed, so m/s.\n\nTherefore, the expression h/(m_e c) would have units (kg·m²/s) divided by (kg·m/s). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, write out the units of numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: kg·m²/s\n\nDenominator: kg·m/s\n\nSo dividing them: (kg·m²/s) / (kg·m/s) = (kg·m²/s) * (s/(kg·m)) )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nkg cancels out from numerator and denominator.\n\nm² divided by m is m.\n\ns in the denominator cancels with the s in the numerator.\n\nSo overall, we have m. \n\nWait, so the units would be meters? That would mean option B, m. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistake.\n\nLet me redo the calculation:\n\nUnit of h is J·s = (kg·m²/s²)·s = kg·m²/s.\n\nDivide by m_e (kg) and multiply by c (m/s)? Wait, no, the expression is h divided by (m_e multiplied by c). So units are [kg·m²/s] divided by [kg·(m/s)].\n\nWhich is [kg·m²/s] / [kg·m/s] = [ (kg/kg) * (m²/m) * (s/s) ] ?\n\nWait, kg cancels, m²/m is m, and s/s is 1? Wait, no. Wait denominator is kg*(m/s), so when dividing, it's equivalent to multiplying by inverse.\n\nSo:\n\n[ kg·m²/s ] * [ 1/(kg·m/s) ) ] = [ kg·m²/s * s/(kg·m) ) ] = [ (kg/kg) * (m²/m) * (s/s) ] = [1 * m * 1] = m.\n\nYes, so the unit is meters. So option B.\n\nBut let me think again if I messed up any step. Let me check another way. Maybe using dimensional analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of what h/(m_e c) represents. Wait, I recall that in physics, there is something called the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m_e c). And the Compton wavelength has units of length, which is meters. So that would confirm that the answer is B. But since I need to do it via unit analysis, let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the options.\n\nOption A is J/s. Well, J/s is power, or watts. Doesn't seem related to length or anything else here.\n\nOption B is meters. As we derived.\n\nOption C is J·m. That's joule-meters. Not sure what that is.\n\nOption D is m/s. Velocity. But our calculation gave meters.\n\nSo if I made no mistake in calculation, answer is B. But let me check again.\n\nAnother approach: Let's substitute the units into the expression.\n\nh has units of J·s.\n\nDivided by (kg·m/s). So:\n\nJ·s / (kg·m/s) = J·s²/(kg·m). Now, since J is kg·m²/s², substitute:\n\n(kg·m²/s²)·s²/(kg·m) = kg·m²/s² * s² / kg·m = (kg/kg)*(m²/m)*(s²/s²) = m. Yep, same result. So answer is B.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B, meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
