This means:\n\n- **Horizontal motion** is affected only by the initial horizontal speed and remains constant (since air resistance is ignored).\n- **Vertical motion** is governed by gravity and is the same for both balls, regardless of their horizontal speed.\n\nAs a result, both balls will **fall at the same rate vertically** and will **hit the ground at the same time** if they are launched from the same height and travel the full horizontal distance to the ground.\n\n---\n\n### The Crucial Difference: Time to Reach the Net\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the **horizontal distance to the net**, not to the ground. The faster ball reaches the net in **less time**, whereas the slower ball takes **more time** to reach the same horizontal position.\n\nSince the **vertical distance fallen** is a function of time (given by $ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $), the ball that takes **more time** to reach the net will have **fallen more** by the time it gets there. If the net is at a certain height, this additional fall can cause the slower ball to **hit the net**, while the faster ball **clears it**.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n- **(A)** Incorrect. Both balls take the same time to fall the same vertical distance because their vertical motion is identical.\n- **(B)** Incorrect. Both balls have the same vertical velocity when descending the same distance, since vertical velocity depends only on time fallen or distance fallen.\n- **(C)** **Correct.** The faster ball takes **less time** to cover the **same horizontal distance** (i.e., the distance to the net), so it **falls less** by the time it reaches the net, allowing it to clear it.\n- **(D)** Incorrect. The higher speed ball does **not** descend a greater distance in the same time; in fact, it descends **less** because it reaches the net in less time.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about two ping pong balls being shot horizontally from the same height with different speeds. The faster one clears the net, but the slower one doesn't. The options are about why that happens. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that when objects are projected horizontally, their vertical motion is independent of their horizontal motion. So, both balls should fall at the same rate vertically because gravity affects them equally, right? Wait, but they have different horizontal speeds. So, maybe the time they take to hit the ground is the same? Because vertical motion is only affected by gravity. So if they're launched from the same height, they should hit the ground at the same time regardless of their horizontal speed. So, if that's the case, maybe the reason one clears the net and the other doesn't is about how far they travel horizontally before hitting the ground.\n\nSo, if the ball has a higher horizontal speed, it covers more horizontal distance in the same amount of time. So, if the net is in the way, the faster ball might make it over before it hits the ground, while the slower one doesn't have enough horizontal speed to reach the other side before dropping. So the key here is that both balls are in the air for the same amount of time, but the faster one travels further horizontally. Therefore, if the horizontal distance to the net is fixed, the one with higher speed would have enough horizontal velocity to reach beyond the net before descending. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) The ball with the lower speed takes more time to descend the same distance. Wait, but if they start from the same height, they should take the same time to descend, right? Because vertical motion is independent. So time to fall depends only on the vertical distance and gravity. So A is incorrect. So A is not the right answer.\n\nB) The ball with the lower speed has a greater velocity in the vertical direction when descending the same distance. Hmm. Wait, when they descend the same vertical distance, their vertical velocity would be same? Because vertical velocity depends on the time fallen or the distance fallen. Since they both start with zero vertical velocity (launched horizontally), their vertical velocity at any given distance fallen should be same. Because v^2 = 2gh, so same h, same velocity. So B is incorrect. So B's statement is wrong.\n\nC) The ball with the higher speed takes less time to cover the same horizontal distance. Wait, if the horizontal distance to the net is fixed, then the time to reach that horizontal distance is t = horizontal distance / horizontal speed. So for the same horizontal distance, a higher speed would take less time. But how does that relate to clearing the net? Well, if the time to reach the net is less for the faster ball, then in that shorter time, it would have fallen less distance vertically. Wait, but if the slower ball takes longer to reach the net, then it would have fallen more in that time, so it might not clear the net. So maybe the reason is that the faster ball reaches the net in less time, so it doesn't fall as much. So if the net is at a certain height, the faster ball doesn't drop enough to hit the net, while the slower one drops too much. So the key is that the time to reach the horizontal position of the net is less for the faster ball, so it falls less. Therefore, option C is correct? Because the higher speed takes less time to cover the same horizontal distance (the distance to the net), so it doesn't fall as much. Therefore, C is the correct answer.\n\nD) The ball with the higher speed descends a greater distance in the same time interval. No, that's not right. Both balls would descend the same distance in the same time because vertical motion is independent. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be C. Let me check again. If the horizontal speed is higher, the time to reach the net (which is a certain horizontal distance away) is shorter. In that shorter time, the vertical drop is less. Therefore, the higher speed ball doesn't drop as much, so it can clear the net. The lower speed ball takes longer to reach the net, so it drops more during that time and hits the net. Therefore, the reason is related to the time taken to reach the horizontal position of the net. Therefore, option C is correct. The higher speed takes less time to cover the same horizontal distance (the distance to the net), so it descends less in that time. So the answer is C.\n</think>"}
