So the question is about the Chang'e-3 lunar lander and some physics concepts related to its landing process. The options given are A to D, and we need to figure out which ones are correct. Let me start by recalling the information provided.\n\nFirst, the probe's mass is approximately 1.3 × 10³ kg. Earth's mass is 81 times that of the moon, Earth's radius is 3.7 times the moon's, and Earth's surface gravity is 9.8 m/s². The probe first orbits the moon in a near-circular path, then hovers at 4 meters height (stationary relative to the moon), and finally free-falls. We need to evaluate the four options based on these details.\n\nLet me start with option A: just before landing, the velocity is approximately 8.9 m/s. Hmm. When the probe free-falls from 4 meters, I think we can model this as a free fall under lunar gravity. The velocity just before impact would depend on the acceleration due to gravity on the moon and the height from which it falls. Since it's a free fall, we can use the kinematic equation v² = u² + 2gh, where u is the initial velocity (which is 0 if it's dropped), g is the lunar gravity, and h is 4 meters. But first, I need to calculate the lunar gravity.\n\nGiven Earth's gravity (g_earth) is 9.8 m/s². The moon's gravity (g_moon) can be found using the formula for gravitational acceleration: g = GM/R². So, if Earth's mass is 81 times the moon's (M_earth = 81 M_moon) and Earth's radius is 3.7 times the moon's (R_earth = 3.7 R_moon), then:\n\ng_earth / g_moon = (G M_earth / R_earth²) / (G M_moon / R_moon²) ) = (M_earth / M_moon) * (R_moon² / R_earth²) ) = 81 * (1 / (3.7)²) ≈ 81 / 13.69 ≈ 5.918. Therefore, g_moon ≈ g_earth / 5.918 ≈ 9.8 / 5.918 ≈ 1.656 m/s². Let me check that calculation again. 81 divided by (3.7)^2. 3.7 squared is 13.69, so 81/13.69 is approximately 5.918. So yes, g_moon is about 9.8 / 5.918 ≈ 1.656 m/s². Let me confirm with exact numbers. 3.7 squared is exactly 13.69? Let me compute 3.7 * 3.7: 3*3.7=11.1, 0.7*3.7=2.59, total 13.69. So yes. So 81/13.69 is approximately 5.918. So g_moon ≈ 9.8 / 5.918 ≈ 1.656 m/s². Let me check with calculator steps: 9.8 divided by 5.918. Let me approximate 5.918 * 1.6 = 9.4688, which is less than 9.8. 5.918 * 1.65 = 5.918*(1.6 + 0.05) = 9.4688 + 0.2959 = 9.7647. Still less than 9.8. 5.918*1.66 = 9.7647 + 0.05918 = 9.8238. So 5.918 * 1.66 ≈ 9.8238. Therefore, 9.8 / 5.918 ≈ 1.66 m/s². So approximately 1.66 m/s² on the moon. Let's take it as 1.62 or 1.63? Maybe the exact value is 1.62 m/s² for lunar gravity. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can take 1.65 or 1.66. Let's proceed with 1.62 m/s² as a standard value for lunar gravity. Wait, but according to NASA, the moon's gravity is about 1.62 m/s². So perhaps my calculation gives 1.65, but the actual value is 1.62. Maybe due to rounding in the problem's given values. The problem says Earth's radius is approximately 3.7 times the moon's. Maybe that's an approximate figure. Let me check again. If Earth's radius is 3.7 times the moon's, then R_earth = 3.7 R_moon. So the ratio of g_earth to g_moon is (M_earth/M_moon) * (R_moon/R_earth)^2 = 81 * (1/3.7)^2 ≈ 81 / 13.69 ≈ 5.918. So if the actual value of g_moon is 1.62, then g_earth would be 5.918 * 1.62 ≈ 9.58 m/s², but the actual g_earth is 9.8. So perhaps the problem's given values are approximate. So in the problem, we need to use the given data to compute g_moon. Let me proceed with the problem's given data. So according to the problem, g_moon = 9.8 / 5.918 ≈ 1.656 m/s². Let's take that as 1.66 m/s².\n\nSo, for option A: free fall from 4 meters. The velocity just before landing would be sqrt(2 * g_moon * h). So sqrt(2 * 1.66 * 4) = sqrt(13.28) ≈ 3.64 m/s. Wait, that's about 3.6 m/s. But option A says approximately 8.9 m/s. That's way higher. So option A must be incorrect. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The free fall from 4 meters on the moon with g ≈ 1.66 m/s². So v = sqrt(2gh). 2*1.66*4 = 13.28. Square root of 13.28 is about 3.64 m/s. So 3.6 m/s. But option A says 8.9 m/s. That's the same as Earth's escape velocity, but here it's a free fall from 4 meters. So option A is incorrect. So A is not correct. So maybe the answer is not A.\n\nNow moving to option B: the reaction force experienced when hovering is about 2 × 10³ N. When the probe is hovering, it's stationary relative to the moon, so the thrust from the engine must balance the weight of the probe. The weight on the moon is m * g_moon. The mass is 1.3 × 10³ kg. So weight is 1300 kg * 1.66 m/s² ≈ 1300 * 1.66. Let's compute that. 1000*1.66=1660, 300*1.66=498. Total is 1660 + 498 = 2158 N. So approximately 2160 N. The option says about 2 × 10³ N, which is 2000 N. So 2158 is approximately 2.16 × 10³ N, so 2 × 10³ N is a reasonable approximation. So option B is correct. So B is a correct option.\n\nOption C: from leaving the near-circular lunar orbit to landing, mechanical energy is conserved. Hmm. Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. However, when the probe is leaving the orbit to hover and then land, there are external forces acting on it. The probe uses its engines to hover and to maneuver from the orbit to the landing. So during the process of leaving the orbit, the engines are firing, which means non-conservative forces are doing work, so mechanical energy is not conserved. Therefore, option C is incorrect. So C is not correct.\n\nOption D: the linear velocity in the near-circular lunar orbit is less than the linear velocity of an artificial satellite in a near-circular Earth orbit. Let's think about orbital velocity. The orbital velocity for a near-surface orbit is given by sqrt(GM/R). So comparing the moon's orbital velocity to Earth's. Since the moon has less mass and smaller radius, but we need to compute the ratio. Let's see. Let's compute the ratio of Earth's orbital velocity to Moon's. The orbital velocity v = sqrt(GM/R). So v_earth / v_moon = sqrt( (G M_earth / R_earth) / (G M_moon / R_moon) )) = sqrt( (M_earth / M_moon) * (R_moon / R_earth) )).\n\nGiven that M_earth = 81 M_moon, R_earth = 3.7 R_moon. So substituting:\n\nv_earth / v_moon = sqrt( 81 * (R_moon / 3.7 R_moon) )) = sqrt(81 / 3.7) = sqrt(21.89) ≈ 4.68. Therefore, Earth's orbital velocity is about 4.68 times that of the moon's. Therefore, the moon's orbital velocity is less than Earth's. So option D is correct. Therefore, D is a correct option.\n\nSo from the options, B and D are correct. However, the problem is in Chinese, and the options are A, B, C, D. The user is asking to choose from A to D, but the options are four, and we have to see which ones are correct. Wait, but in the problem statement, the options are (A) to (D), and the user says \"From A to D, we should choose...\", but the original problem in Chinese might have multiple correct options, or maybe only one. Wait, the way the question is phrased is \"the probe: Options: (A)... (B)... (C)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So in Chinese tests, sometimes multiple options can be correct, but sometimes only one. Let me check again.\n\nSo according to my analysis, B and D are correct. Let me check again.\n\nOption D: linear velocity in lunar orbit is less than Earth's. As we calculated, Earth's orbital velocity is higher. So yes, the moon's is less. So D is correct.\n\nOption B: reaction force is about 2 × 10³ N. Our calculation was 2158 N, which is approx 2.16 × 10³ N, so 2 × 10³ is a reasonable approximation. So B is correct.\n\nOption A: velocity before landing is 8.9 m/s. Our calculation was 3.6 m/s. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption C: mechanical energy is conserved. No, because engines are firing, so non-conservative work is done. So C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. However, looking back at the original problem, the options are given as (A), (B), (C), (D), and the user is to choose from A to D. Depending on whether multiple options can be selected or not. In some Chinese exams, multiple options can be correct. However, in the problem statement here, the user hasn't specified if it's multiple choice. But looking at the way the options are presented, maybe it's a multiple-choice question where multiple options can be correct. However, in the original problem, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the probe: Options: (A)... (B)... (C)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So maybe in Chinese tests, sometimes multiple options are correct, but the way the options are presented here, perhaps the answer is B and D. However, in the given options, maybe the answer expects multiple correct answers. But the user is to write the answer as \"Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" with the correct options. In Chinese tests, sometimes they use letters like A, B, C, D, and sometimes it's multiple correct. However, in this case, the problem might have more than one correct answer. Let me check again.\n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake in my reasoning. For option D, the linear velocity in lunar orbit vs Earth's. Let me compute the actual numbers. For Earth's near-surface orbit, the velocity is about 7.9 km/s, which is 7900 m/s. For the moon, the near-surface orbital velocity would be sqrt(G M_moon / R_moon). Alternatively, using the ratio we calculated earlier, v_earth / v_moon ≈ 4.68. So if Earth's is 7900 m/s, then the moon's would be 7900 / 4.68 ≈ 1689 m/s. Which is about 1.69 km/s. So yes, much less than Earth's 7.9 km/s. So option D says the lunar orbit velocity is less than Earth's, which is correct. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. But the problem may have only one correct answer. Wait, but the original problem may have multiple correct answers. However, in the given options, perhaps the answer is B and D. But let me check if there's any other mistake.\n\nWait, option B says the reaction force is about 2 × 10³ N. Our calculation was approximately 2158 N. So 2.16 × 10³ N. So 2 × 10³ is 2000 N. Depending on the approximation, maybe the problem expects us to use a more approximate value for g_moon. Let me recalculate g_moon using the given data again. The problem says Earth's mass is 81 times the moon's, Earth's radius is 3.7 times the moon's. So g_moon = g_earth * (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth / R_moon)^2. Wait, no. The formula for gravitational acceleration is g = GM/R². So for the moon, g_moon = G M_moon / R_moon². For Earth, g_earth = G M_earth / R_earth². Therefore, g_moon / g_earth = (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth / R_moon)^2. Since M_earth = 81 M_moon, R_earth = 3.7 R_moon, then:\n\ng_moon / g_earth = (1/81) * (3.7)^2 = 13.69 / 81 ≈ 0.169. Therefore, g_moon ≈ 0.169 * 9.8 ≈ 1.656 m/s². So same as before. So the weight is 1300 kg * 1.656 ≈ 2153 N. So approximately 2150 N. The option says about 2 × 10³ N, which is 2000 N. So 2000 is 2150 - 150 N less. Depending on the problem's approximation, maybe they consider 1.6 * 1300 = 2080 N, which is closer to 2 × 10³. If the problem says \"about,\" then 2 × 10³ N is a reasonable approximation. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, options B and D are correct. However, in the original problem, maybe only one of them is correct. Wait, but looking back, the options are given as separate options. Let me check if there's any other possibility.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in option D. Let me think again. The linear velocity in a near-circular lunar orbit vs Earth's. The orbital velocity is sqrt(GM/R). For Earth's near surface orbit, it's about 7.9 km/s. For the moon, as we calculated, about 1.7 km/s. So yes, less. So D is correct. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. However, in some cases, the problem might only have one correct answer. Wait, but the original problem is in Chinese, and the way it's presented here, the user hasn't specified if multiple answers are allowed. In Chinese multiple-choice questions, sometimes it's multiple correct answers. However, the way the options are presented here (A, B, C, D) could mean that multiple are correct, but the user is to select all that apply. However, the way the user wrote the question is ambiguous. But according to the analysis, B and D are correct.\n\nBut looking back at the original problem statement, the options are given as (A), (B), (C), (D), and the user is to choose from them. In Chinese exams, sometimes multiple options are correct, and you have to select all that apply. However, the options here are four, and the answer might be B and D. However, let me check if there's any other mistake.\n\nWait, for option A, the velocity is 8.9 m/s. Wait, 8.9 m/s is about the escape velocity of Earth, but here it's the moon's free fall from 4 meters. But maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me recalculate the velocity again. The free fall from 4 meters with g = 1.66 m/s². So v = sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2 * 1.66 * 4) = sqrt(13.28) ≈ 3.64 m/s. So 3.6 m/s. So option A is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. However, in the original problem, maybe there's a trick. For example, option D says the linear velocity in the near-circular lunar orbit is less than that in a near-Earth orbit. Which we have determined is true. So D is correct. Option B is also correct. Therefore, if the problem allows multiple correct answers, then B and D are correct. But if the problem is a single-answer multiple-choice, then perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the reaction force. Let me check again. The probe's mass is 1.3 × 10³ kg. So 1300 kg. The weight on the moon is m * g_moon = 1300 * 1.656 ≈ 2153 N. The option says about 2 × 10³ N, which is 2000 N. So 2153 is approximately 2.15 × 10³ N. If the problem says \"about,\" then 2 × 10³ N is a reasonable approximation. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D. But looking at the options, the user might need to select both B and D. However, in some cases, the problem might have only one correct answer. Let me check if there's any other consideration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction force when hovering is not just the weight. Because when hovering, the probe is firing its engines to stay stationary. The thrust from the engine must equal the weight. So the reaction force experienced by the probe is the thrust, which is equal to the weight. So yes, 2153 N, which is approx 2 × 10³ N. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. However, the way the question is presented here, the user might expect multiple answers. In Chinese tests, sometimes options are labeled with letters and you select all that apply. However, since the user hasn't specified, but the original problem may have multiple correct answers. Therefore, the answer should be B and D.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement again, the options are given as (A) to (D), and the user is to choose from them. In some cases, the options might be designed such that only one is correct. But according to the analysis, both B and D are correct. Therefore, the correct answer is B and D. However, since the user is to provide the answer in the format \"Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\", I need to check if in the original problem there are multiple correct answers. Given that the user provided the options as separate and the analysis shows B and D are correct, the answer is B and D. But let me check if there's any other mistake.\n\nWait, for option D, the linear velocity in the near-circular lunar orbit is less than that in a near-Earth orbit. Since the moon has a smaller mass and radius, the orbital velocity is lower. For example, Earth's near-orbit velocity is about 7.9 km/s, while the moon's is about 1.7 km/s. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D. However, in the given options, if only one is correct, then perhaps there's a mistake. But according to the analysis, both B and D are correct. Therefore, the answer should be B and D. However, in the original problem, maybe there's a trick. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the probe: therefore, the probe: (options)\". So maybe there are multiple correct answers. Therefore, the answer is B and D. So the user should choose B and D. However, in the original problem, maybe the options are designed for single answer, but according to the analysis, both B and D are correct. Therefore, I think the correct answer is B and D. However, in some cases, the options might have only one correct answer. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the lunar gravity. Let me recalculate using the given data again.\n\nGiven: Earth's mass is 81 times moon's, Earth's radius is 3.7 times moon's. Earth's surface gravity is 9.8 m/s².\n\nThe formula for surface gravity is g = GM/R².\n\nFor Earth: g_earth = G M_earth / R_earth².\n\nFor Moon: g_moon = G M_moon / R_moon².\n\nTherefore, g_moon / g_earth = (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth / R_moon)^2.\n\nSince M_earth = 81 M_moon, and R_earth = 3.7 R_moon.\n\nSo:\n\ng_moon / g_earth = (1/81) * (3.7)^2 = 13.69 / 81 ≈ 0.169.\n\nTherefore, g_moon = 0.169 * 9.8 ≈ 1.656 m/s². Correct.\n\nSo weight is 1300 * 1.656 ≈ 2153 N. So option B is correct.\n\nFor option D, the orbital velocity is sqrt(GM/R). For Earth's near-orbit: v_earth = sqrt(G M_earth / R_earth). For Moon's near-orbit: v_moon = sqrt(G M_moon / R_moon). Therefore, v_moon / v_earth = sqrt( (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth / R_moon) ) = sqrt( (1/81) * 3.7 ) = sqrt(3.7 / 81) ≈ sqrt(0.0457) ≈ 0.214. So v_moon ≈ 0.214 * v_earth. Since v_earth is about 7.9 km/s, v_moon ≈ 1.69 km/s. Therefore, the lunar orbital velocity is much less than Earth's. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D. So the answer should be B and D. However, if the problem expects only one correct answer, there might be a mistake. But according to the analysis, both B and D are correct. Therefore, the answer is B and D.\n</think>"}
