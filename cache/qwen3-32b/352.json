The question is about the gravitational force between two objects when their masses and the distance between them are changed. I remember that Newton's law of universal gravitation is involved here. The formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nSo the original force is F = G*(m1*m2)/r². Now, the problem says that the mass of each object is doubled. So m1 becomes 2m1 and m2 becomes 2m2. Also, the distance between their centers is doubled, so r becomes 2r. \n\nLet me plug these into the formula. The new force F' would be G*(2m1 * 2m2)/(2r)². Let me calculate the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator for the masses is 2*2 = 4 times the original m1*m2. The denominator is (2r) squared, which is 4r². So putting it all together, F' = G*(4m1m2)/(4r²). \n\nSimplifying that, the 4 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so F' = G*(m1m2)/r². Wait, that's the same as the original force F. So the new force is the same as the original force. So the answer would be D: It remains the same. \n\nBut let me double-check my steps. When you double both masses, the product of the masses becomes 4 times larger. But when you double the distance, the denominator becomes 4 times larger as well. So the two effects cancel each other out. So yes, the force remains the same. That makes sense because the 4 in the numerator and denominator cancel. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
