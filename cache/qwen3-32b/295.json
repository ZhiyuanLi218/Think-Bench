The solution has 200.00 cm³ volume with 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5×10⁻³, 6.2×10⁻⁸, and 1.8×10⁻¹². The options are A to D with concentrations around 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nFirst, I should recall what orthophosphate ions are. Orthophosphate is PO4³⁻, right? So the question is asking for [PO4³⁻] in the solution. \n\nThe solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociation. \n\nKH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it should dissociate into K⁺ and H2PO4⁻. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. It should dissociate into 2 Na⁺ and HPO4²⁻, along with water molecules. \n\nSo the solution has H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ ions. These are two of the phosphate species. Since we have both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, maybe this is a buffer solution? The phosphate buffer system usually involves H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. \n\nBut the question is about PO4³⁻ concentration. So I need to find how much PO4³⁻ is present in this solution. \n\nPhosphate can undergo multiple dissociation steps. Let me write down the dissociation equations for H3PO4:\n\nFirst dissociation: H3PO4 ⇌ H⁺ + H2PO4⁻, Ka1 = 7.5×10⁻³  \nSecond dissociation: H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻, Ka2 = 6.2×10⁻⁸  \nThird dissociation: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻, Ka3 = 1.8×10⁻¹²  \n\nBut in our solution, we have H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. So the third dissociation is HPO4²⁻ losing a proton to become PO4³⁻. The Ka3 is very small (1.8×10⁻¹²), which means that the concentration of PO4³⁻ should be very low. \n\nSo to find [PO4³⁻], I can use the third dissociation. Since Ka3 is so small, the amount of PO4³⁻ will be minimal, so I can assume that the concentration of HPO4²⁻ is approximately equal to the initial concentration from Na2HPO4·2H2O minus the tiny amount that dissociates into PO4³⁻. But since Ka3 is so small, maybe I can approximate [HPO4²⁻] ≈ initial concentration. \n\nLet me first calculate the concentrations of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ in the solution.\n\nStarting with KH2PO4: 1.00 g in 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.200 L). \n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. \n\nMoles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 mol (approximate). Let me compute that more accurately:\n\n1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007348 mol. \n\nVolume is 0.200 L, so concentration is 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M. So [H2PO4⁻] ≈ 0.03674 M.\n\nSimilarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g in 0.200 L. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. \n\nMoles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol. \n\nConcentration is 0.005618 / 0.200 ≈ 0.02809 M. So [HPO4²⁻] ≈ 0.02809 M. \n\nSo the solution has H2PO4⁻ at ~0.03674 M and HPO4²⁻ at ~0.02809 M. \n\nBut how does this relate to PO4³⁻? \n\nLooking at the third dissociation: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻. The equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n\nWe need to find [PO4³⁻], so rearranged:\n\n[PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 × [HPO4²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n\nBut we need to find [H⁺]. Since the solution is a buffer of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation. \n\nThe second dissociation is H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻, with pKa2 = -log(6.2×10⁻⁸) ≈ 7.21. \n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:\n\npH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])\n\nHere, the base is HPO4²⁻ and the acid is H2PO4⁻. \n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻])\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\npH = 7.21 + log(0.02809 / 0.03674)\n\nLet me compute the ratio first: 0.02809 / 0.03674 ≈ 0.7647. \n\nlog(0.7647) ≈ -0.116. \n\nTherefore, pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.094. \n\nSo pH ≈ 7.09. \n\nThen, [H⁺] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09). Let me calculate that. \n\n10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7) × 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1×10⁻⁷ × 0.812 ≈ 8.12×10⁻⁸ M. \n\nSo [H⁺] ≈ 8.12×10⁻⁸ M. \n\nNow, going back to the third dissociation. \n\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n\nRearranged:\n\n[PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 × [HPO4²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa3 is 1.8×10⁻¹², [HPO4²⁻] is 0.02809 M, [H⁺] is 8.12×10⁻⁸ M.\n\nSo:\n\n[PO4³⁻] = (1.8×10⁻¹² × 0.02809) / 8.12×10⁻⁸ \n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1.8×10⁻¹² × 0.02809 ≈ 5.056×10⁻¹⁴\n\nDenominator: 8.12×10⁻⁸ \n\nSo [PO4³⁻] ≈ 5.056×10⁻¹⁴ / 8.12×10⁻⁸ ≈ 6.23×10⁻⁷ M. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is 6.24×10⁻⁷ M. That seems to be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again for any possible errors. \n\nFirst, the concentrations of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. \n\nFor KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007348 mol. \n\nVolume is 0.200 L, so 0.007348 / 0.200 = 0.03674 M. Correct. \n\nNa2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol. \n\nDivided by 0.200 L gives 0.02809 M. Correct. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: \n\nlog(0.02809 / 0.03674) = log(0.7647). Let me check log(0.7647). \n\nUsing calculator-like steps: log(0.7647) = log(7.647×10⁻¹) = log(7.647) - 1 ≈ 0.883 - 1 = -0.117. So approx -0.117. So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 ≈ 7.093. \n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.093). Let me compute that more accurately. \n\nLet me recall that 10^(-7) = 1×10⁻⁷. Then, 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) × 10^(-0.093). \n\nWhat is 10^(-0.093)? Let me use natural logs or approximate. \n\nWe know that ln(10) ≈ 2.3026. \n\nLet me use the approximation that ln(10^x) = x ln(10). \n\nBut maybe better to remember some values. \n\nAlternatively, 10^(-0.093) ≈ 1 / 10^0.093. \n\nWhat is 10^0.093? Let me recall that 10^0.1 ≈ 1.2589, so 0.093 is slightly less than 0.1. \n\nLet me use linear approximation. Let’s take the derivative of 10^x at x=0.1. \n\nBut maybe better to use a calculator-like approach. \n\nAlternatively, use logarithm tables or approximate using known values. \n\nAlternatively, use the formula 10^x ≈ e^{x ln 10}. \n\nSo x = -0.093. \n\nSo 10^{-0.093} = e^{-0.093 * ln 10} ≈ e^{-0.093 * 2.3026} ≈ e^{-0.2141} ≈ 1 - 0.2141 + ... \n\nWait, the Taylor series for e^{-0.2141} is approximately 1 - 0.2141 + (0.2141²)/2 - ... \n\nBut maybe better to remember that e^{-0.2141} ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^{-0.2} ≈ 0.8187, and e^{-0.22} ≈ e^{-0.2} * e^{-0.02} ≈ 0.8187 * 0.9802 ≈ 0.802. \n\nOur value is -0.2141, which is between -0.2 and -0.22. Let me approximate. \n\nLet’s take the value at x = -0.2141. Let me use linear approximation between x=-0.2 and x=-0.22.\n\nAt x=-0.2, e^x ≈ 0.8187  \nAt x=-0.22, e^x ≈ 0.802 (as above)  \nDifference in x: 0.02, difference in e^x: 0.8187 - 0.802 = 0.0167 over 0.02 change in x. \n\nOur x is -0.2141, which is 0.0141 above -0.22. Wait, no: the original x is -0.093 * ln10 ≈ -0.2141. Wait, I think I confused steps here. Let me rephrase. \n\nEarlier, I was trying to compute 10^{-0.093} = e^{-0.093 * ln10} ≈ e^{-0.093 * 2.3026} ≈ e^{-0.2141}. \n\nSo I need e^{-0.2141}. \n\nWe can approximate this as follows. Let me take that e^{-0.2141} ≈ ?\n\nLet me use a calculator-like approach. Let me recall that ln(0.8) ≈ -0.2231. So e^{-0.2231} = 0.8. \n\nOur exponent is -0.2141, which is less negative than -0.2231. So e^{-0.2141} is slightly higher than 0.8. \n\nThe difference between -0.2141 and -0.2231 is +0.009. So we can approximate using the derivative of e^x at x=-0.2231. \n\nThe derivative of e^x is e^x. At x=-0.2231, e^x = 0.8. So the linear approximation is e^{x + Δx} ≈ e^x + e^x * Δx. \n\nHere, Δx = 0.009. \n\nSo e^{-0.2141} ≈ 0.8 + 0.8 * 0.009 = 0.8 + 0.0072 = 0.8072. \n\nTherefore, 10^{-0.093} ≈ 0.8072. \n\nTherefore, [H+] ≈ 1×10⁻⁷ * 0.8072 ≈ 8.07×10⁻⁸ M. \n\nEarlier, I had approximated 8.12×10⁻⁸, which is close. So let's take [H+] ≈ 8.07×10⁻⁸ M. \n\nThen, going back to [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 × [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+] \n\nKa3 = 1.8×10⁻¹²  \n[HPO4²⁻] = 0.02809 M  \n[H+] ≈ 8.07×10⁻⁸ M \n\nSo numerator: 1.8×10⁻¹² * 0.02809 ≈ 1.8 * 0.02809 × 10⁻¹² ≈ 0.05056 × 10⁻¹² = 5.056×10⁻¹⁴ \n\nDenominator: 8.07×10⁻⁸ \n\nSo [PO4³⁻] ≈ 5.056×10⁻¹⁴ / 8.07×10⁻⁸ ≈ (5.056 / 8.07) × 10⁻⁶ ≈ 0.6265 × 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.265×10⁻⁷ M \n\nWhich is approximately 6.27×10⁻⁷ M. The given options are A:3.97×10⁻⁷, B:2.81×10⁻⁷, C:5.48×10⁻⁷, D:6.24×10⁻⁷. So D is 6.24×10⁻⁷, which is very close to my calculated 6.265×10⁻⁷. The difference is due to rounding during calculations. \n\nLet me check if I made any miscalculations in the steps. \n\nFirst, the moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = approx 0.007348 mol. Correct. \n\nVolume is 0.200 L, so concentration is 0.03674 M. Correct. \n\nNa2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = approx 0.005618 mol. Correct. \n\nConcentration is 0.02809 M. Correct. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]). \n\npKa2 is -log(6.2×10⁻⁸). Let me compute pKa2 more accurately. \n\nKa2 = 6.2×10⁻⁸. \n\npKa2 = -log(6.2×10⁻⁸) ≈ ?\n\nlog(6.2×10⁻⁸) = log(6.2) + log(10⁻⁸) ≈ 0.7924 - 8 = -7.2076. \n\nTherefore, pKa2 ≈ 7.2076. \n\nEarlier I approximated as 7.21. So more accurately, 7.2076. \n\nThen, log([base]/[acid]) = log(0.02809 / 0.03674) = log(0.7647). \n\nLet me compute log(0.7647) more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator (if I had one), but since I don't, let me use logarithm tables or better approximations. \n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion around a known value. For example, log(0.76) is known?\n\nAlternatively, remember that log(0.76) ≈ -0.119, log(0.77) ≈ -0.113. \n\nSince 0.7647 is between 0.76 and 0.77. Let me do a linear approximation. \n\nLet’s assume between x=0.76 and x=0.77, log(x) changes from -0.119 to -0.113. The difference in x is 0.01, and the difference in log(x) is +0.006. \n\nOur x is 0.7647, which is 0.7647 - 0.76 = 0.0047 above 0.76. \n\nTherefore, the fraction is 0.0047 / 0.01 = 0.47. \n\nTherefore, the log(x) ≈ -0.119 + 0.47*(0.006) ≈ -0.119 + 0.00282 ≈ -0.11618. \n\nSo log(0.7647) ≈ -0.1162. \n\nTherefore, pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.1162 ≈ 7.0914. \n\nSo pH ≈ 7.0914. \n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0914). Let me compute this more accurately. \n\nAgain, 10^(-7.0914) = 10^(-7) × 10^(-0.0914). \n\nCompute 10^(-0.0914). Let me use the same method as before. \n\nConvert to natural logs: 10^(-0.0914) = e^{-0.0914 * ln(10)} ≈ e^{-0.0914 * 2.3026} ≈ e^{-0.2104}. \n\nNow, e^{-0.2104} ≈ ?\n\nAgain, knowing that e^{-0.2} ≈ 0.8187 and e^{-0.2104} is slightly less. \n\nLet me use the Taylor series expansion around x=-0.2. \n\nLet me take x = -0.2104. Let me write x = -0.2 - 0.0104. \n\nLet me use the expansion e^{x} ≈ e^{-0.2} * e^{-0.0104} ≈ 0.8187 * (1 - 0.0104 + ...) ≈ 0.8187 * 0.9896 ≈ 0.8187 * 0.9896. \n\nCalculate 0.8187 * 0.9896: \n\nFirst, 0.8 * 0.9896 = 0.7917  \nThen, 0.0187 * 0.9896 ≈ 0.0185  \nTotal ≈ 0.7917 + 0.0185 ≈ 0.8102. \n\nTherefore, e^{-0.2104} ≈ 0.8102. \n\nTherefore, [H+] ≈ 1×10⁻⁷ * 0.8102 ≈ 8.102×10⁻⁸ M. \n\nSo more accurately, [H+] ≈ 8.10×10⁻⁸ M. \n\nNow, going back to [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 × [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+] \n\nKa3 = 1.8×10⁻¹²  \n[HPO4²⁻] = 0.02809 M  \n[H+] = 8.10×10⁻⁸ M \n\nCalculating numerator: 1.8×10⁻¹² * 0.02809 = 1.8 * 0.02809 × 10⁻¹² ≈ 0.050562 × 10⁻¹² = 5.0562×10⁻¹⁴ \n\nDenominator: 8.10×10⁻⁸ \n\nSo [PO4³⁻] = 5.0562×10⁻¹⁴ / 8.10×10⁻⁸ ≈ (5.0562 / 8.10) × 10⁻⁶ \n\nCalculating 5.0562 / 8.10: \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1.0: \n\n≈ 5.0562 / 8.10 ≈ 0.6242 \n\nTherefore, [PO4³⁻] ≈ 0.6242 × 10⁻⁶ = 6.242×10⁻⁷ M. \n\nWhich is approximately 6.24×10⁻⁷ M, which matches option D. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \n\nBut let me check if there are any other factors I might have missed. \n\nOne thing to consider is whether the activity coefficients or ionic strength affect the calculation, but since the concentrations are relatively low (around 0.03 M and 0.028 M), the ionic strength isn't extremely high, so assuming ideal behavior (using concentrations instead of activities) should be acceptable for this problem. \n\nAnother thing is whether the presence of other ions (like K+ and Na+) affects the dissociation. However, since the problem gives Ka values, and we are using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation which assumes that the only relevant equilibria are the dissociation steps of the phosphate, the presence of spectator ions (K+ and Na+) shouldn't affect the calculation of [H+] or [PO4³⁻]. \n\nAlso, we assumed that [HPO4²⁻] ≈ 0.02809 M and [H2PO4⁻] ≈ 0.03674 M. However, technically, some of the HPO4²⁻ could dissociate into PO4³⁻, but since Ka3 is so small, the change in [HPO4²⁻] is negligible. Similarly, some of the H2PO4⁻ could associate to form H3PO4, but since Ka1 is relatively large (7.5×10⁻³), but given that we have a buffer solution with H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the concentration of H3PO4 would be minimal. \n\nTherefore, the approximation that [HPO4²⁻] ≈ 0.02809 M and [H2PO4⁻] ≈ 0.03674 M is valid. \n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) is approximately 6.24×10⁻⁷ M, which is option D. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
