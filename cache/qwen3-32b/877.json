Let me start by recalling what entropy is. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. A decrease in entropy means the system becomes more ordered. So, I need to look at each reaction and see how the number of gas molecules changes, because gases have higher entropy than solids or liquids.\n\nStarting with option A: C(s) + CO2(g) → 2 CO(g). Let me count the moles of gas on each side. On the left, there's 1 mole of CO2 gas. On the right, there are 2 moles of CO gas. So the number of gas molecules increases from 1 to 2. That means the entropy is increasing here. So this reaction has an increase in entropy, not a decrease. So A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: 2 Na(s) + O2(g) → Na2O2(s). Let's check the gas moles. On the left, there's 1 mole of O2 gas. On the right, Na2O2 is a solid. So the gas is consumed here. Starting with 1 mole of gas and ending with no gas. So the number of gas molecules decreases from 1 to 0. That should lead to a decrease in entropy. So B is a candidate.\n\nOption C: CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g). Let's count the gas molecules. On the left, there's 1 mole of CH4 and 2 moles of O2, totaling 3 moles of gas. On the right, there's 1 mole of CO2 and 2 moles of H2O gas, totaling 3 moles of gas. So the number of gas molecules is the same on both sides. So the entropy change might be small or maybe slightly negative if solids or liquids are involved, but here all are gases. Wait, but maybe H2O is a liquid? Wait, the reaction shows H2O(g), so it's gas. So same number of gas molecules. So entropy change might be minimal here. So C is probably not the answer.\n\nOption D: 2 NI3(s) → 3 I2(s) + N2(g). Let's look at gas molecules. On the left, there are no gases (solid NI3). On the right, there's 1 mole of N2 gas and the rest are solids. So the number of gas molecules increases from 0 to 1. That's an increase in entropy. So D is increasing entropy, not decreasing. So D is not the answer.\n\nSo among the options, B is the only one where gas is consumed and turned into a solid. So the entropy decreases here. But wait, let me double-check. In B, 1 mole of gas is converted into a solid. That's a big decrease in entropy. In other reactions, either gas is produced or same amount. So B is the answer. But let me check again if I made any mistake in counting.\n\nFor B: 2 Na(s) + O2(g) → Na2O2(s). Reactants: 2 moles of solid Na and 1 mole of O2 gas. Products: 1 mole of Na2O2 solid. So gas is going from 1 mole to zero. Solids are more ordered than gas. So the decrease in entropy is significant here. \n\nIn reaction C, even though the number of gas molecules is the same, maybe the complexity of the molecules affects entropy? For example, O2 and CH4 versus CO2 and H2O. But since the problem asks for the greatest decrease in entropy, and in C the number of gas molecules is same, so maybe entropy is roughly same or maybe slightly negative? Not sure. But compared to B, which has a significant decrease (from 1 gas to none), B is more significant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n</think>"}
