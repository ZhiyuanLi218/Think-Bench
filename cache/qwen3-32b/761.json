The centers of these spheres are denoted as $ O_1, O_2, O_3 $, and the distances between their centers are:\n\n$$\nO_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 24, \\quad O_1O_3 = r_1 + r_3 = 30, \\quad O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 32\n$$\n\nA plane intersects each sphere, forming three **congruent** circles. The centers of these circles are $ A, B, C $, and lie on the plane. All sphere centers are on the **same side** of the plane.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Use Geometry of Sphere-Plane Intersection**\n\nWhen a sphere is intersected by a plane, the radius $ r $ of the resulting circle is related to the perpendicular distance $ h $ from the sphere's center to the plane by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$\nr^2 + h^2 = R^2\n\\Rightarrow r^2 = R^2 - h^2\n$$\n\nSince the three circles are congruent, their radii are equal. Let $ r $ be the common radius. Then:\n\n$$\nr^2 = 11^2 - h_1^2 = 13^2 - h_2^2 = 19^2 - h_3^2\n$$\n\nFrom this, we derive:\n\n$$\nh_2^2 - h_1^2 = 13^2 - 11^2 = 48 \\\\\nh_3^2 - h_1^2 = 19^2 - 11^2 = 240\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Use Distance Between Sphere Centers and Their Projections**\n\nLet’s denote the distance between the projections of two sphere centers onto the plane as $ AB $, $ AC $, and $ BC $.

A plane intersects each sphere, creating three congruent circles with centers at A, B, and C. The centers of the spheres are all on the same side of the plane, and we're given that AB² is 560. We need to find AC². \n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are three spheres, each touching the other two externally. So, the distance between the centers of any two spheres should be equal to the sum of their radii. Let me confirm that. If two spheres are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is indeed the sum of their radii. So, for example, the distance between the centers of the spheres with radii 11 and 13 would be 11 + 13 = 24. Similarly, between 11 and 19, it would be 30, and between 13 and 19, it would be 32. \n\nBut maybe I need to denote the centers of the spheres. Let me call them O₁, O₂, O₃ for the spheres with radii 11, 13, 19 respectively. Then, the distances between O₁O₂ = 24, O₁O₃ = 30, and O₂O₃ = 32. \n\nNow, there's a plane cutting through all three spheres, creating circles. The circles are congruent, meaning they have the same radius. The centers of these circles are A, B, C, which lie on the plane. Also, all the sphere centers are on the same side of the plane. \n\nSince the plane intersects each sphere, the intersection is a circle whose radius can be calculated if we know the distance from the sphere's center to the plane. Let me recall that formula. If a sphere with radius R is cut by a plane at distance h from the center, then the radius r of the circle of intersection is given by Pythagoras: r² + h² = R². Therefore, r = √(R² - h²). \n\nIn this problem, all three circles are congruent, so their radii are equal. Therefore, √(11² - h₁²) = √(13² - h₂²) = √(19² - h₃²), where h₁, h₂, h₃ are the distances from O₁, O₂, O₃ to the plane. Let me denote the common radius of the circles as r. Therefore, we have:\n\nFor sphere 1: r² = 11² - h₁²  \nFor sphere 2: r² = 13² - h₂²  \nFor sphere 3: r² = 19² - h₃²  \n\nSo, equating them:\n\n11² - h₁² = 13² - h₂²  \nand  \n11² - h₁² = 19² - h₃²  \n\nWhich gives:\n\nh₂² - h₁² = 13² - 11² = 169 - 121 = 48  \nand  \nh₃² - h₁² = 19² - 11² = 361 - 121 = 240  \n\nSo, h₂² = h₁² + 48  \nand h₃² = h₁² + 240  \n\nNow, the centers A, B, C of the circles on the plane are the projections of the sphere centers O₁, O₂, O₃ onto the plane. Because if you have a sphere and a plane cutting it, the center of the circle is the foot of the perpendicular from the sphere's center to the plane. Therefore, the vector from O₁ to A is perpendicular to the plane, same with O₂ to B and O₃ to C. \n\nTherefore, the points A, B, C are the projections of O₁, O₂, O₃ onto the plane. Therefore, the distance between A and B is the distance between the projections of O₁ and O₂ onto the plane. \n\nBut how do we relate AB² to the distance between O₁ and O₂? Let me think. If we have two points O₁ and O₂, and their projections A and B onto a plane, then the distance AB can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in 3D. Specifically, if h₁ and h₂ are the distances from O₁ and O₂ to the plane, then the line segment O₁O₂ has length equal to sqrt(AB² + (h₁ - h₂)²). Wait, is that right?\n\nYes, because the line segment O₁O₂ can be considered as the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is AB (the distance between the projections) and the other leg is the difference in heights, which is |h₁ - h₂|. However, since all centers are on the same side of the plane, h₁, h₂, h₃ are all positive, so h₁ - h₂ could be positive or negative, but squared, it's (h₁ - h₂)². \n\nTherefore, for O₁O₂, which we already know is 24, we have:\n\nO₁O₂² = AB² + (h₁ - h₂)²  \nSo 24² = AB² + (h₁ - h₂)²  \nWe are given AB² = 560. Let me check if this is consistent. \n\nWait, 24² is 576. If AB² is 560, then (h₁ - h₂)² = 576 - 560 = 16. Therefore, h₁ - h₂ = ±4. But since h₁ and h₂ are distances from the plane, and the centers are on the same side, if the plane is closer to one sphere, its h is smaller. But since the radii are different, and the circles are congruent, the distances h₁, h₂, h₃ must be different. Let me think about whether h₁ - h₂ is positive or negative. \n\nBut maybe we don't need to know the sign, since we have (h₁ - h₂)² = 16. Also, we have earlier expressions for h₂² - h₁² = 48. Let me write that down:\n\nh₂² - h₁² = (h₂ - h₁)(h₂ + h₁) = 48  \nBut we also have (h₁ - h₂)² = 16, so (h₂ - h₁)² = 16, so h₂ - h₁ = ±4. Therefore, substituting into the first equation:\n\nIf h₂ - h₁ = 4, then 4*(h₂ + h₁) = 48 => h₂ + h₁ = 12  \nIf h₂ - h₁ = -4, then -4*(h₂ + h₁) = 48 => h₂ + h₁ = -12, but since h₁ and h₂ are distances (positive numbers), their sum can't be negative. Therefore, h₂ - h₁ must be 4, and h₂ + h₁ = 12. \n\nTherefore, solving these two equations:\n\nh₂ - h₁ = 4  \nh₂ + h₁ = 12  \nAdding them: 2h₂ = 16 => h₂ = 8, then h₁ = 12 - h₂ = 4. \n\nSo h₁ = 4 and h₂ = 8. \n\nSimilarly, we can use the other equation h₃² - h₁² = 240. Since h₁ = 4, h₁² = 16, so h₃² = 16 + 240 = 256 => h₃ = 16 (since it's positive). \n\nTherefore, we have h₁ = 4, h₂ = 8, h₃ = 16. \n\nNow, we need to find AC². Similarly, AC is the distance between the projections of O₁ and O₃ onto the plane. So, similar to AB, we can use the formula:\n\nO₁O₃² = AC² + (h₁ - h₃)²  \nWe know O₁O₃ is the distance between centers of spheres with radii 11 and 19, which is 11 + 19 = 30. Therefore:\n\n30² = AC² + (4 - 16)²  \nWhich is 900 = AC² + (-12)² => 900 = AC² + 144 => AC² = 900 - 144 = 756. \n\nWait, so is that the answer? 756? Let me check my steps again. \n\nFirst, we found h₁, h₂, h₃ by using AB². Then, using O₁O₃ distance, we compute AC². Seems straightforward. Let me check if there is something missing here. \n\nBut maybe I need to check if there are more relations? For example, maybe also considering BC²? The problem didn't give BC², but maybe we can check consistency? Let me try that. \n\nSimilarly, the distance between O₂ and O₃ is 13 + 19 = 32. Then, BC² + (h₂ - h₃)^2 = 32². \n\nWe have h₂ = 8, h₃ = 16, so h₂ - h₃ = -8, squared is 64. Therefore, BC² = 32² - 64 = 1024 - 64 = 960. \n\nBut the problem didn't mention BC², so maybe we don't need it. However, since the problem says the three circles are congruent, maybe there is another check? Let me check if the radii are consistent. \n\nEarlier, we had r² = 11² - h₁² = 121 - 16 = 105. \n\nCheck with sphere 2: 13² - h₂² = 169 - 64 = 105. \n\nSphere 3: 19² - h₃² = 361 - 256 = 105. \n\nYes, so all give r² = 105. So the circles are indeed congruent. So that checks out. \n\nSo, according to this calculation, AC² is 756. But let me check again:\n\nO₁O₃ is 30. The distance between A and C is AC, and (h₁ - h₃) is 4 - 16 = -12, squared is 144. Then AC² = 30² - 144 = 900 - 144 = 756. \n\nYes. \n\nBut the problem says \"mutually externally tangent\". Wait, so the spheres are all touching each other externally. Therefore, their centers form a triangle with sides 24, 30, 32. Let me check if that triangle is valid. \n\nCheck triangle inequalities: 24 + 30 > 32? 54 > 32 yes. 24 + 32 > 30? 56 > 30 yes. 30 + 32 > 24? 62 > 24 yes. So it's a valid triangle. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider coordinates? Maybe to verify? Let me try setting up coordinates. \n\nLet me assume the plane is the xy-plane for simplicity. Wait, but the plane is arbitrary. However, since we are dealing with projections, maybe we can assign coordinates accordingly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the centers O₁, O₂, O₃ in 3D space. Let me consider coordinates. Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0), since it's on the plane. Wait, but maybe it's better to set up coordinates such that the plane is the xy-plane. Let me try that. \n\nLet me assume the plane is the xy-plane, z=0. Then, the centers A, B, C are points in the xy-plane, with coordinates (x_A, y_A, 0), etc. The centers of the spheres O₁, O₂, O₃ are then points directly above A, B, C, at distances h₁, h₂, h₃. Therefore, O₁ is (x_A, y_A, h₁), O₂ is (x_B, y_B, h₂), O₃ is (x_C, y_C, h₃). \n\nGiven that, the distance between O₁ and O₂ is sqrt[(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2 + (h₂ - h₁)^2] = sqrt[AB² + (h₂ - h₁)^2] = sqrt[560 + 16] = sqrt[576] = 24, which matches. Similarly for other distances. \n\nTherefore, my previous calculation is consistent. Therefore, AC² is 756. \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe there is a trick here? For example, maybe the triangle ABC is related to the triangle O₁O₂O₃ somehow? \n\nAlternatively, since we know AB², and we need AC², perhaps using coordinates. Let me try to think if there is another way. \n\nSuppose we consider triangle ABC. The distances between A, B, C are related to the distances between O₁, O₂, O₃ and the heights h₁, h₂, h₃. \n\nWe have AB² = O₁O₂² - (h₁ - h₂)^2 = 24² - 4² = 576 - 16 = 560, which is given. Similarly, AC² = O₁O₃² - (h₁ - h₃)^2 = 30² - 12² = 900 - 144 = 756. \n\nSame as before. \n\nAlternatively, BC² = O₂O₃² - (h₂ - h₃)^2 = 32² - 8² = 1024 - 64 = 960. \n\nSo, if we wanted, we could consider triangle ABC with sides squared 560, 756, 960. But unless there's something else required, perhaps this is sufficient. \n\nBut the problem didn't mention anything else. Therefore, unless there is a miscalculation here, the answer is 756. \n\nWait, let me check once again all steps for errors. \n\nFirst, the distance between sphere centers: yes, sum of radii. \n\nThen, formula for circle radius on plane: correct. \n\nThen, since circles are congruent, set equations equal. \n\nThen, for O₁O₂ distance: AB² + (h₁ - h₂)^2 = O₁O₂². Correct. \n\nGiven AB² = 560, O₁O₂² = 24² = 576. Therefore, (h₁ - h₂)^2 = 16. Then, using h₂² - h₁² = 48, which factors into (h₂ - h₁)(h₂ + h₁) = 48. Since h₂ - h₁ is 4 or -4, but only 4 gives positive sum. Then solving gives h₁=4, h₂=8. Then h₃ from h₃² - h₁²=240 gives h₃=16. \n\nThen, for AC²: O₁O₃² - (h₁ - h₃)^2 = 30² - 12² = 900 - 144 = 756. \n\nAll steps seem correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different answer? Let me check calculations once again. \n\nh₁ = 4, h₂ = 8, h₃ = 16. \n\nFor sphere 1: r² = 11² - 4² = 121 - 16 = 105. \n\nSphere 2: 13² - 8² = 169 - 64 = 105. \n\nSphere 3: 19² - 16² = 361 - 256 = 105. \n\nYes, all circles have radius squared 105, so congruent circles. \n\nTherefore, all steps are consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 756. \n\nBut let me check once more if there is a different interpretation. For example, maybe the plane is not cutting all spheres in circles with the same radius, but same diameter? No, congruent circles would mean same radius. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D and there is some other configuration? But given that the centers are projected onto the plane, and the distances between projections relate to the distances between sphere centers and the heights, I think the approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use coordinates to solve for AC²? Let me try. \n\nLet me assign coordinates. Let me assume that point A is at (0, 0, 0), point B is at (sqrt(560), 0, 0), since AB² = 560. Then, point C is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates of C as (x, y, 0). Then, AC² = x² + y², and BC² = (x - sqrt(560))² + y². \n\nBut we also know BC² = 960, as calculated before. Therefore:\n\n(x - sqrt(560))² + y² = 960  \nand  \nx² + y² = AC² (which we need to find)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n(x - sqrt(560))² + y² - x² - y² = 960 - AC²  \nExpanding (x - sqrt(560))² - x²:\n\nx² - 2x*sqrt(560) + 560 - x² = -2x*sqrt(560) + 560 = 960 - AC²  \nTherefore:\n\n-2x*sqrt(560) + 560 = 960 - AC²  \nRearranged:\n\nAC² = 960 + 2x*sqrt(560) - 560 = 400 + 2x*sqrt(560)\n\nBut we need another equation to find x. However, we might need to relate this to the third sphere. \n\nBut how? Since we also know the positions of O₁, O₂, O₃. \n\nO₁ is at (0, 0, h₁) = (0, 0, 4)  \nO₂ is at (sqrt(560), 0, h₂) = (sqrt(560), 0, 8)  \nO₃ is at (x, y, h₃) = (x, y, 16)  \n\nAdditionally, the distance between O₁ and O₃ should be 30, and between O₂ and O₃ should be 32. \n\nSo let's write equations for O₁O₃ and O₂O₃. \n\nFirst, O₁O₃ distance squared: \n\n(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 + (16 - 4)^2 = x² + y² + 144 = 30² = 900  \nTherefore, x² + y² = 900 - 144 = 756. Which is AC²! Therefore, AC² is 756. \n\nSimilarly, O₂O₃ distance squared: \n\n(x - sqrt(560))² + (y - 0)^2 + (16 - 8)^2 = (x - sqrt(560))² + y² + 64 = 32² = 1024  \nTherefore, (x - sqrt(560))² + y² = 1024 - 64 = 960, which matches BC² = 960 as before. \n\nTherefore, this coordinate approach also gives AC² = 756. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 756. \n\nI think this confirms it. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 756. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{756}\n</think>"}
