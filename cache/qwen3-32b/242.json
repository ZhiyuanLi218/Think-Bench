Hmm, let me recall what I know about black body radiation.\n\nFirst, I remember Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the wavelength at which the emission of a black body is maximum to its temperature. The law is given by λ_max * T = b, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the wavelength changes, the temperature must have changed accordingly. \n\nThen, the total emissive power of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the power radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, P = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Therefore, if I can find the ratio of the temperatures before and after heating, I can then raise that ratio to the fourth power to find the factor by which the total emissive power increases.\n\nAlright, let's start with Wien's Law. Let me denote the initial wavelength as λ₁ = 0.69 μm and the final wavelength as λ₂ = 0.50 μm. According to Wien's Law, λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. So T₁ / T₂ = λ₂ / λ₁. \n\nLet me write that down:\n\nT₁ / T₂ = λ₂ / λ₁\n\nTherefore, T₂ / T₁ = λ₁ / λ₂\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nT₂ / T₁ = 0.69 / 0.50\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.69 divided by 0.50 is 1.38. So the temperature increases by a factor of 1.38.\n\nNow, since the total emissive power is proportional to T^4, the ratio of the total emissive powers will be (T₂ / T₁)^4.\n\nSo let me compute (1.38)^4. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, 1.38 squared. Let me compute 1.38 * 1.38.\n\n1.38 * 1.38:\n\nLet me do 1.3 * 1.3 = 1.69, but since it's 1.38, maybe better to do it properly.\n\n(1 + 0.38)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.38 + 0.38^2 = 1 + 0.76 + 0.1444 = 1.9044.\n\nWait, but 1.38 squared. Alternatively, 1.38 * 1.38:\n\nMultiply 1.38 by 1.38:\n\nFirst, 1 * 1.38 = 1.38\n\nThen 0.3 * 1.38 = 0.414\n\nThen 0.08 * 1.38 = 0.1104\n\nAdding them together: 1.38 + 0.414 = 1.794 + 0.1104 = 1.9044. Yes, same result. So 1.9044 is (1.38)^2.\n\nThen, (1.38)^4 is (1.9044)^2. Let me compute that.\n\nCalculating 1.9044 squared:\n\nLet me approximate this. Let me note that 1.9^2 = 3.61. But since it's 1.9044, slightly more than 1.9.\n\nLet me write 1.9044 as 1.9 + 0.0044.\n\nSo (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a = 1.9, b = 0.0044.\n\na² = (1.9)^2 = 3.61\n\n2ab = 2 * 1.9 * 0.0044 = 3.8 * 0.0044 = 0.01672\n\nb² = (0.0044)^2 ≈ 0.00001936\n\nAdding them up: 3.61 + 0.01672 + 0.00001936 ≈ 3.62673936\n\nSo approximately 3.6267. However, this is a rough estimation. Maybe I should do a more accurate calculation.\n\nAlternatively, let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me compute 1.9044 * 1.9044.\n\nFirst, multiply 1.9044 * 1.9044:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n1.9044 × 1.9044\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 1.9044 × 1 = 1.9044\n\nThen 1.9044 × 0.9 = 1.71396\n\nThen 1.9044 × 0.004 = 0.0076176\n\nThen 1.9044 × 0.0004 = 0.00076176\n\nWait, actually, this might not be the best way. Let me use the standard multiplication method for decimals.\n\nAlternatively, since I know that (a + b)^2 where a = 1.9 and b = 0.0044 gives me approximately 3.6267. But maybe I should use more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms or remember that 1.9^2 = 3.61, 1.91^2 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.91^2:\n\n1.91 * 1.91:\n\n= (2 - 0.09)^2\n\n= 4 - 2*2*0.09 + 0.09^2\n\nWait, no, that's not helpful. Let me do 1.91 * 1.91.\n\nMultiply 1.91 by 1.91:\n\nFirst, 1 * 1.91 = 1.91\n\nThen 0.9 * 1.91 = 1.719\n\nThen 0.01 * 1.91 = 0.0191\n\nAdding them together? Wait, no. Actually, the standard way is:\n\n1.91\n\n×1.91\n\n------------\n\nMultiply 1.91 by 1: 1.91\n\nMultiply 1.91 by 9 (tenths place): 17.19, shifted one decimal: 17.19\n\nMultiply 1.91 by 1 (hundreds place): 1.91, shifted two decimals: 1.91\n\nWait, no. Wait, 1.91 × 1.91:\n\nFirst, multiply 1.91 × 1.91:\n\nBreak it down as (2 - 0.09) × (2 - 0.09) = 4 - 0.36 + 0.0081 = 3.6481? Wait, that might not be right. Wait, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². If a = 2, b = 0.09, then (2 - 0.09)^2 = 4 - 2*2*0.09 + 0.09² = 4 - 0.36 + 0.0081 = 3.64 + 0.0081 = 3.6481. Yes, so 1.91² is 3.6481.\n\nBut our value is 1.9044, which is slightly less than 1.91. Let me compute the difference. 1.91 - 1.9044 = 0.0056. So, 1.9044 is 1.91 - 0.0056. Let me denote x = 1.91 - 0.0056, so x² = (1.91 - 0.0056)^2 = 1.91² - 2*1.91*0.0056 + (0.0056)^2 ≈ 3.6481 - 0.0213 + 0.000031 ≈ 3.6481 - 0.0213 = 3.6268. So approximately 3.6268. Which matches my previous estimate. Therefore, (1.9044)^2 ≈ 3.6268. Therefore, (1.38)^4 ≈ 3.6268.\n\nBut let me check if my initial calculation of T₂ / T₁ is correct. The initial wavelength is 0.69 μm, final is 0.50 μm. Since λ_max is inversely proportional to T, then T is inversely proportional to λ_max. Therefore, if the wavelength decreases, the temperature increases. So T₂ / T₁ = λ₁ / λ₂ = 0.69 / 0.50 = 1.38, as I had before. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of total emissive power is (T₂ / T₁)^4 ≈ (1.38)^4 ≈ 3.6268. Therefore, approximately 3.63 times increase.\n\nBut let me check if I can calculate 1.38^4 more accurately. Maybe using another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use natural logarithms. Let me recall that ln(1.38^4) = 4 * ln(1.38). Let me compute ln(1.38). I know that ln(1) = 0, ln(e) = 1 ≈ 2.718. Let me remember that ln(1.38) can be approximated. Maybe I can remember some values. For example, ln(1.386) is approximately 0.326, since e^0.3 ≈ 1.349, e^0.35 ≈ 1.419. Let me try to approximate ln(1.38):\n\nLet me use Taylor series or remember that ln(1.38). Let me use calculator-like approximation.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4 + ... for small x. But 0.38 is not that small. Alternatively, use known values. For example, ln(1.3) ≈ 0.2624, ln(1.35) ≈ 0.3001, ln(1.4) ≈ 0.3365. Let me interpolate between these.\n\nSince 1.38 is between 1.35 and 1.4. Let me find how much.\n\nFrom 1.35 to 1.4 is 0.05. 1.38 is 0.03 above 1.35. So 0.03 / 0.05 = 0.6 of the way from 1.35 to 1.4.\n\nAssuming linearity (which isn't exact, but for approximation), the difference in ln between 1.35 and 1.4 is 0.3365 - 0.3001 = 0.0364. So 0.6 * 0.0364 ≈ 0.0218. Adding to ln(1.35) ≈ 0.3001 + 0.0218 ≈ 0.3219. So ln(1.38) ≈ 0.3219. Therefore, 4 * ln(1.38) ≈ 4 * 0.3219 ≈ 1.2876. Then exponentiating: e^1.2876 ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^1.2 ≈ 3.32, e^1.3 ≈ 3.669, e^1.2876 is between them. Let me calculate 1.2876 - 1.2 = 0.0876. So e^1.2 * e^0.0876. e^0.0876 ≈ 1 + 0.0876 + 0.0876²/2 + 0.0876³/6 ≈ 1 + 0.0876 + 0.00383 + 0.00027 ≈ 1.0917. Therefore, e^1.2876 ≈ 3.32 * 1.0917 ≈ 3.32 * 1.09 ≈ 3.61. Which is close to our previous value of 3.6268. So about 3.61 to 3.63. Considering the approximations, it's safe to say approximately 3.63.\n\nBut let me check with a calculator method. Wait, if I can't use a calculator, but maybe I can remember that 1.3^4 is 2.8561, 1.4^4 is (1.4^2)^2 = 1.96^2 = 3.8416. Since 1.38 is between 1.3 and 1.4, 1.38^4 is between 2.8561 and 3.8416. Our approximate value of ~3.63 is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 1.38^4 more accurately by breaking it down:\n\nWe already have 1.38^2 = 1.9044.\n\nNow compute 1.9044 * 1.9044:\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 1.9044 by 1.9044:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n1.9044 × 1.9044\n\nLet me consider multiplying 1.9044 × 1.9044:\n\nBreak it down into (1 + 0.9 + 0.0044) × (1 + 0.9 + 0.0044)? No, that might not help. Alternatively, use the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\nLet me write 1.9044 × 1.9044:\n\nFirst, multiply 1.9044 × 1 = 1.9044\n\nThen 1.9044 × 0.9 = 1.71396\n\nThen 1.9044 × 0.004 = 0.0076176\n\nThen 1.9044 × 0.0004 = 0.00076176\n\nWait, but actually, when multiplying decimals, it's better to do it as:\n\nLet me think of 1.9044 as 19044 × 10^-4. Then multiplying by itself would be (19044)^2 × 10^-8. But that's complicated without a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the identity that (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 where a = 1.9 and b = 0.0044. Wait, I did that earlier and got approx 3.6268. Let me accept that as a reasonable approximation.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 3.63. However, maybe I need to be more precise. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me use decimal multiplication:\n\nLet me write 1.9044 × 1.9044:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n       1.9044\n     × 1.9044\n     -----------\n\nFirst, multiply 1.9044 by 4 (the fourth decimal place): 0.00076176\n\nThen multiply 1.9044 by 4 (the third decimal place): 0.0076176, shifted one position: 0.0076176\n\nThen multiply 1.9044 by 0 (the second decimal place, which is 0 in 1.9044?), no, actually, this approach is getting messy. Let me use the standard multiplication steps:\n\nMultiply 1.9044 by each digit of 1.9044:\n\nLet me consider 1.9044 × 1.9044:\n\nFirst, ignore the decimals and multiply 19044 × 19044, then adjust the decimal places. But without a calculator, this is tedious. Alternatively, accept that my previous approximation is sufficient for the purposes of this problem.\n\nGiven that in exams or homework, sometimes exact fractions are used or maybe the numbers are chosen such that the ratio comes out nicely. Let me check if 0.69 and 0.50 have some relation. Let me compute 0.69 / 0.50 = 1.38 exactly. Is 1.38 a number that when raised to the fourth power gives a nice number? Maybe not. Let me check with exact fractions.\n\nWait, 0.69 is 69/100, 0.50 is 1/2. Therefore, T2 / T1 = (69/100) / (1/2) = (69/100) * 2 = 138/100 = 69/50 = 1.38. So exact fraction is 69/50. Therefore, (T2 / T1)^4 = (69/50)^4. Maybe compute that as fractions?\n\nBut that would be tedious. Alternatively, maybe approximate 69/50 as 1.38, and compute 1.38^4. Alternatively, use logarithms with more accurate values.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that 1.38^4 = e^{4 ln 1.38}. If I can get a better approximation of ln 1.38.\n\nEarlier, I approximated ln(1.38) ≈ 0.3219. Let me try to compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me recall that ln(1.38) can be calculated using the Taylor series around a known point. For example, let me take a = 1.35, where ln(1.35) ≈ 0.3001 (as before). Let me expand ln(x) around x = 1.35.\n\nLet me denote x = 1.35 + Δx, where Δx = 0.03. Then,\n\nln(x) ≈ ln(1.35) + (Δx)/1.35 - (Δx)^2/(2*(1.35)^2) + ...\n\nSo:\n\nln(1.38) ≈ ln(1.35) + 0.03/1.35 - (0.03)^2/(2*(1.35)^2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nln(1.35) ≈ 0.3001\n\n0.03 / 1.35 = 0.022222...\n\n(0.03)^2 = 0.0009\n\nDenominator: 2*(1.35)^2 = 2*(1.8225) = 3.645\n\nSo the second term is -0.0009 / 3.645 ≈ -0.0002469\n\nTherefore, total approximation:\n\n0.3001 + 0.022222 - 0.0002469 ≈ 0.3001 + 0.022222 = 0.3223 - 0.0002469 ≈ 0.32205. Therefore, ln(1.38) ≈ 0.32205. So more accurately, 0.32205. Then multiply by 4: 4 * 0.32205 ≈ 1.2882. Now, compute e^1.2882.\n\nWe know that e^1.2882. Let me recall that e^1.28 ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^1.2 ≈ 3.3201, e^1.28 can be calculated as e^1.2 * e^0.08.\n\nWe know e^0.08 ≈ 1 + 0.08 + 0.0032 + 0.00017 + ... ≈ 1.08327. Therefore, e^1.28 ≈ 3.3201 * 1.08327 ≈ Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 3.3201 * 1 = 3.3201\n\n3.3201 * 0.08 = 0.265608\n\n3.3201 * 0.00327 ≈ approx 0.01083\n\nAdding together: 3.3201 + 0.2656 ≈ 3.5857 + 0.0108 ≈ 3.5965. Therefore, e^1.28 ≈ 3.5965.\n\nNow, our exponent is 1.2882, which is 1.28 + 0.0082. So we need to compute e^1.28 * e^0.0082.\n\nWe already have e^1.28 ≈ 3.5965. Now e^0.0082 ≈ 1 + 0.0082 + (0.0082)^2/2 ≈ 1 + 0.0082 + 0.0000336 ≈ 1.0082336. Therefore, multiplying:\n\n3.5965 * 1.0082336 ≈ 3.5965 + 3.5965 * 0.0082336 ≈ \n\nFirst compute 3.5965 * 0.008 = 0.028772\n\nThen 3.5965 * 0.0002336 ≈ approx 0.00084\n\nTotal ≈ 0.028772 + 0.00084 ≈ 0.0296\n\nTherefore, total e^1.2882 ≈ 3.5965 + 0.0296 ≈ 3.6261. Therefore, approximately 3.626. Which matches our prior calculation of 3.6268. So this is about 3.626. Therefore, the factor is approximately 3.63.\n\nTherefore, the total emissive power increases by a factor of approximately 3.63. Depending on the required precision, maybe we need to calculate it more accurately or perhaps the problem expects an exact value using the ratio of temperatures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more precise way using exact values of Wien's constant and Stefan-Boltzmann constant? Wait, but since the problem doesn't give specific values for Wien's constant or Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and since they cancel out when taking the ratio, we don't need them. The ratio depends only on the temperatures, which depend on the wavelengths via Wien's Law.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the factor is (λ₁ / λ₂)^4 = (0.69 / 0.50)^4 = (1.38)^4 ≈ 3.63. However, let me check if there is a calculation mistake here. Let me verify once again.\n\nGiven λ_max * T = b => T = b / λ_max. Therefore, T1 = b / λ₁ and T2 = b / λ₂. Therefore, T2 / T1 = λ₁ / λ₂. Correct. Therefore, (T2 / T1)^4 = (λ₁ / λ₂)^4. So the factor is (0.69 / 0.50)^4. Which is indeed (1.38)^4 ≈ 3.63.\n\nBut let me compute 1.38^4 with another method. Let me compute 1.38 * 1.38 = 1.9044 as before. Then 1.9044 * 1.9044. Let me approximate this by using linear approximation around 1.9^2 = 3.61. Let me consider f(x) = x². At x = 1.9, f(x) = 3.61. The derivative f’(x) = 2x. So at x = 1.9, f’(x) = 3.8. Now, our x is 1.9044, which is Δx = 0.0044 above 1.9. Therefore, approximate f(x + Δx) ≈ f(x) + f’(x) * Δx = 3.61 + 3.8 * 0.0044 ≈ 3.61 + 0.01672 ≈ 3.6267. Which is the same as before. Therefore, confirming that (1.9044)^2 ≈ 3.6267. Therefore, 1.38^4 ≈ 3.6267. So approximately 3.63.\n\nBut let me check with decimal precision. Let me do 1.9044 × 1.9044:\n\nLet me write 1.9044 × 1.9044:\n\nBreak it into (1.9 + 0.0044) × (1.9 + 0.0044) = 1.9² + 2×1.9×0.0044 + 0.0044² = 3.61 + 0.01672 + 0.00001936 ≈ 3.61 + 0.01672 = 3.62672 + 0.000019 ≈ 3.62674. Therefore, exactly as before. Therefore, the exact value is approximately 3.6267. So rounding to three decimal places, 3.627. Depending on what the problem expects, maybe two decimal places? If so, 3.63. But maybe we need to present more precise value or a fractional value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact calculation using fractions. Let me try that. Let me compute (69/50)^4.\n\nFirst, 69/50 is 1.38. Let me compute (69/50)^4.\n\nFirst compute (69/50)^2 = (69^2)/(50^2) = 4761 / 2500 ≈ 1.9044, which matches our previous result.\n\nThen, square that result: (4761 / 2500)^2 = (4761^2) / (2500^2). Let me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nBut without a calculator, this is going to be tedious. Let me see if I can approximate or find a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since we already know that (69/50)^4 ≈ 3.6267, which is approximately 3.63. However, maybe the exact fractional value is not necessary here. Since the problem gives the wavelengths to two decimal places, maybe we can assume that the answer should be given to two or three significant figures.\n\nGiven that the initial wavelengths are given as 0.69 μm and 0.50 μm, both with two decimal places. However, 0.69 has two significant figures? Wait, 0.69 μm is two decimal places, but significant figures: if it's written as 0.69, that's two significant figures. Similarly, 0.50 is two significant figures (the trailing zero might be considered significant if there's a decimal point). Wait, 0.50 has two significant figures. So the ratio 0.69 / 0.50 is 1.38, which has three significant figures? Wait, the number of significant figures in the result of division is the smallest number of significant figures in the operands. Here, both 0.69 and 0.50 have two significant figures. Wait, 0.50 has two significant figures? If it's written as 0.50, then yes, the trailing zero is significant because there's a decimal point. So 0.50 is two decimal places but two significant figures? Wait, no, significant figures: leading zeros are not significant. In 0.50, the first zero is leading and not significant, the second zero is after the decimal and after a non-zero digit, so it is significant. Therefore, 0.50 has two significant figures. Similarly, 0.69 has two significant figures. Therefore, the ratio 0.69 / 0.50 = 1.38 has two significant figures? Wait, no, when dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Both have two significant figures, so the result should be rounded to two significant figures. Therefore, 1.38 should be rounded to 1.4. Wait, but 0.69 / 0.50 is exactly 1.38, but with two significant figures, it would be 1.4. Therefore, if we follow significant figures, the temperature ratio is 1.4, and then the emissive power ratio is (1.4)^4 = 3.8416. But this seems conflicting with our previous calculation of ~3.63. \n\nWait, this is an important point. Depending on whether we consider significant figures or not, the answer might differ. However, in most textbook problems, unless specified, we usually carry out the exact calculation with the given numbers, assuming they are precise. So even though 0.69 and 0.50 have two significant figures, in the context of a problem like this, we might be expected to treat them as exact values for the sake of calculation. Therefore, proceed with the exact ratio 0.69 / 0.50 = 1.38 and compute (1.38)^4 ≈ 3.63.\n\nBut let me check with the exact numbers. If the problem is from a textbook or an exam, maybe there's a standard way. For example, sometimes in such problems, you are supposed to use Wien's law and Stefan-Boltzmann law with the constants given, but since they cancel out here, it's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a calculation mistake. Let me recheck:\n\nGiven λ_max1 = 0.69 μm, λ_max2 = 0.50 μm.\n\nT1 = b / λ_max1, T2 = b / λ_max2.\n\nTherefore, T2 / T1 = λ_max1 / λ_max2 = 0.69 / 0.50 = 1.38. Correct.\n\nTotal emissive power P = σT^4. Therefore, P2 / P1 = (T2 / T1)^4 = (1.38)^4 ≈ 3.626 ≈ 3.63. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 3.63. Depending on the problem's requirement, maybe we need to round it to two decimal places, two significant figures? If the original data has two significant figures, then the answer should have two significant figures, so 3.6. Wait, 3.63 rounded to two significant figures is 3.6. However, if the problem assumes that the given wavelengths are precise (e.g., three significant figures for 0.69, which could be if the decimal is after two digits, but usually 0.69 is two significant figures). Wait, 0.69 could be two or three significant figures depending on context, but generally, trailing zeros after a decimal are significant. In 0.69, there are two significant figures. Similarly, 0.50 is two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be two significant figures. Therefore, 3.6. But earlier calculation gave us 3.626, which is approximately 3.6 when rounded to two significant figures. However, 3.626 is closer to 3.6 than 3.7? Wait, 3.626 is 3.63 when rounded to three significant figures, and 3.6 when rounded to two. \n\nBut maybe in the problem's context, they expect more precise answer. Since in many textbooks, such problems often give numbers with more decimals or specify that they are precise. For example, if the wavelengths are given as 0.69 and 0.50, maybe they are intended to be three significant figures? For example, if it's 0.690 μm and 0.500 μm, then they have three significant figures. But here it's written as 0.69 and 0.50. In that case, it's two significant figures. However, since the ratio 0.69 / 0.50 is exactly 1.38, which is three significant figures. If the problem is designed to test the concept rather than error propagation, they might expect you to use the exact ratio and calculate the exact factor. Hence, giving 3.63 as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact value is different? Let me check with precise calculation using calculator-like computation. Since I can't use a calculator here, but I can try another approach.\n\nLet me note that 1.38^4 = (1.3^4) + ... Wait, no. Alternatively, use binomial expansion for (1 + 0.38)^4. Wait, 1.38 = 1 + 0.38. So:\n\n(1 + 0.38)^4 = 1^4 + 4*1^3*0.38 + 6*1^2*(0.38)^2 + 4*1*(0.38)^3 + (0.38)^4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1st term: 1\n\n2nd term: 4 * 0.38 = 1.52\n\n3rd term: 6 * (0.38)^2 = 6 * 0.1444 = 0.8664\n\n4th term: 4 * (0.38)^3 = 4 * 0.054872 = 0.219488\n\n5th term: (0.38)^4 = 0.02085136\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 + 1.52 = 2.52\n\n2.52 + 0.8664 = 3.3864\n\n3.3864 + 0.219488 = 3.605888\n\n3.605888 + 0.02085136 ≈ 3.626739\n\nWhich is the same as before, approximately 3.6267. Therefore, confirming that the exact value via binomial expansion is approximately 3.6267, so 3.63 when rounded to three significant figures. Given that, if the problem allows three significant figures, then 3.63 is acceptable. Considering that the original numbers, if they have two decimal places but maybe three significant figures? For example, if 0.69 μm is three significant figures, but no, leading zeros don't count. 0.69 is two significant figures. Therefore, strictly speaking, with two significant figures, the answer should be 3.6. However, given that the ratio of temperatures is 1.38 (three significant figures?), because 0.69 / 0.50 = 1.38. If 0.69 has two significant figures and 0.50 has two significant figures, then the result of division should have two significant figures. 1.38 rounded to two significant figures is 1.4. Then (1.4)^4 = 3.8416, which would be 3.8 with two significant figures. But this contradicts our previous calculation. This is a conflict between significant figures rules and the actual precise calculation. \n\nThis is a common issue in physics problems. Usually, in such textbook problems, the numbers are considered exact for the sake of calculation, and you are supposed to provide the answer based on the exact computation, ignoring significant figures unless specified. Therefore, I think the expected answer here is approximately 3.63. Therefore, I should go with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a calculation mistake. Let me check once again.\n\nOriginal wavelengths: 0.69 μm to 0.50 μm. Using Wien's Law:\n\nλ_max * T = constant => T ∝ 1/λ_max. Therefore, T2 / T1 = λ1 / λ2 = 0.69 / 0.50 = 1.38. Correct.\n\nTotal emissive power P ∝ T^4. Therefore, P2 / P1 = (T2 / T1)^4 = (1.38)^4 ≈ 3.63. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems right. Therefore, the factor is approximately 3.63. Depending on the problem's requirement, maybe it wants an exact fractional value or a decimal. Since 3.63 is already a decimal, and given that the problem didn't specify, I think this is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check with another method. Suppose I use actual values of Wien's constant and compute temperatures, then use Stefan-Boltzmann. Let me try that.\n\nWien's displacement constant b is approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K. Let me compute temperatures.\n\nFirst, initial wavelength λ₁ = 0.69 μm = 0.69 × 10^-6 m.\n\nT₁ = b / λ₁ = 2.8977719×10^-3 / (0.69×10^-6) = 2.8977719 / 0.69 × 10^3 ≈ let me compute 2.8977719 / 0.69.\n\nDividing 2.8977719 by 0.69:\n\nFirst, 0.69 × 4 = 2.76. Subtract from 2.8977719: 2.8977719 - 2.76 = 0.1377719.\n\nNow, 0.69 × 0.2 = 0.138. So approximately 0.2. Therefore, total is 4.2 approximately. Therefore, T₁ ≈ 4.2 × 10^3 K = 4200 K (approximate).\n\nSimilarly, T₂ = b / λ₂ = 2.8977719×10^-3 / (0.50×10^-6) = 2.8977719 / 0.50 × 10^3 = 5.7955438 × 10^3 ≈ 5795.5 K.\n\nNow, compute the ratio T₂ / T₁ ≈ 5795.5 / 4200 ≈ Let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 57.955 / 42 ≈ 1.38. Exactly as before. Therefore, confirming that T₂ / T₁ ≈ 1.38.\n\nNow, compute P2 / P1 = (T2 / T1)^4 ≈ 1.38^4 ≈ 3.63. Therefore, same result. Therefore, even with actual numbers, the ratio is about 3.63. Therefore, this must be the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the factor by which the total emissive power increases is approximately 3.63. Depending on the problem's requirement for decimal places or significant figures, but since the given data allows for this precision, and in the absence of specific instructions, I think it's safe to present the answer as approximately 3.63. However, to check if there is a more precise value or a standard way to present it, but I don't think so. Therefore, I will go with 3.63.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total emissive power increases by a factor of \\boxed{3.63}.\n</think>"}
