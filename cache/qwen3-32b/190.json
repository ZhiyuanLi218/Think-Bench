Determining the Redshift**\n\nThe quasar's spectrum peaks at **790 nm** in the near-infrared, and the flux drops significantly at **shorter wavelengths**. This behavior suggests a **spectral break**, likely due to a known feature in the rest frame of the quasar.\n\nA plausible candidate for such a drop is the **Lyman break**, which occurs at a rest-frame wavelength of **912 Å (0.0912 µm or 91.2 nm)**. This break is caused by the absorption of photons with energy above the Lyman limit by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium.\n\nUsing the redshift formula:\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} - 1 = \\frac{790\\ \\text{nm}}{91.2\\ \\text{nm}} - 1 \\approx 8.66 - 1 = 7.66\n$$\n\nThus, the quasar is at a redshift of approximately **z ≈ 7.7**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Comoving Distance in a Lambda-CDM Universe**\n\nThe **comoving distance** to an object at redshift $ z $ in a flat $\\Lambda$CDM universe is given by:\n\n$$\nD_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \\Omega_\\Lambda}}\n$$\n\nGiven:\n- $ c = 3 \\times 10^5 $ km/s\n- $ H_0 = 70 $ km/s/Mpc\n- $ \\Omega_m = 0.3 $\n- $ \\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.7 $\n\nWe can calculate the **dimensionless Hubble constant**:\n\n$$\n\\frac{c}{H_0} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^5}{70} \\approx 4285.7\\ \\text{Mpc} = 4.286\\ \\text{Gpc}\n$$\n\nThe integral:\n\n$$\n\\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{\\sqrt{0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7}}\n$$\n\nmust be evaluated numerically or approximated.

Let me try to break this down step by step. First, I need to recall what comoving distance means. From what I remember, comoving distance is a way of measuring distances in an expanding universe that factors out the expansion. It's the distance you would measure if you somehow \"froze\" the expansion of the universe. So, it's a useful concept for comparing distances at different times in the universe's history.\n\nThe problem states that the quasar has a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. I need to figure out the comoving distance to this quasar given the Lambda-CDM model parameters: Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ωm = 0.3, dark energy density parameter ΩΛ = 0.7, and the universe is flat. The options are A: 6 Gpc, B: 8 Gpc, C: 7 Gpc, D: 9 Gpc.\n\nHmm. To find the comoving distance, I think I need to relate the observed properties of the quasar to its redshift, and then use the redshift to compute the comoving distance. The key here is probably determining the redshift z of the quasar based on the spectral peak. But how?\n\nThe question mentions that the peak is at 790 nm. I wonder if this is the rest wavelength or the observed wavelength. Since quasars are typically very distant objects, their spectral features are redshifted. If the peak is observed at 790 nm, but the intrinsic peak (rest frame) is at a shorter wavelength (since flux drops at shorter wavelengths), then the redshift would be such that the rest wavelength λ_rest is less than 790 nm. But how do I know the intrinsic peak wavelength of the quasar?\n\nQuasars are active galactic nuclei, and their spectra often show broad emission lines and a continuum. The continuum can be approximated by a power law or something else. However, the problem states that in the optical and near-infrared, there's a peak at 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths the flux drops. So maybe this is the Balmer break or some other feature? Or perhaps it's the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the quasar.\n\nWait, the SED of a quasar typically has a big blue bump in the UV/optical due to thermal emission from the accretion disk, and then a power-law component in the X-rays and radio. But in the optical, the SED is rising towards shorter wavelengths. However, the problem says that at shorter wavelengths (<790 nm) the flux drops significantly. That's the opposite of the typical quasar SED. So maybe this is not the rest frame peak. If the quasar's intrinsic spectrum has a peak at a shorter wavelength (say, in the UV), then due to redshift, that peak is observed at 790 nm. Therefore, the redshift z would be such that λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z). So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, and the intrinsic peak is at λ_rest, then z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1.\n\nBut how do I determine λ_rest? The problem doesn't give me that information. Maybe I need to infer it from the fact that the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. If the intrinsic spectrum has a sharp drop at a certain wavelength, then that could be a spectral feature. For example, the Lyman break at 912 Å (which is in the UV). But that's a different case. Wait, the Lyman break is a sharp drop in flux shortward of 912 Å due to absorption by neutral hydrogen. However, if the quasar is at a redshift where this break is observed at 790 nm, then λ_rest = 912 Å, and λ_observed = 790 nm. Let me check that.\n\nConvert 912 Å to nm: 912 Å = 0.0912 microns = 91.2 nm. Wait, 912 Å is 91.2 nm. If that's the rest wavelength, then z = (790 nm / 91.2 nm) - 1 ≈ (8.66) - 1 = 7.66. That's a redshift of about 7.7, which is extremely high. But comoving distance for such a redshift would be enormous. However, the options given are up to 9 Gpc. Wait, let's see: what's the comoving distance for z=7.7?\n\nBut maybe the drop at shorter wavelengths is not the Lyman break. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer break at 3646 Å (which is in the blue part of the spectrum). Let's see. If the Balmer break is at 3646 Å (rest frame), and the observed break is at 790 nm (7900 Å). Then z = (7900 / 3646) - 1 ≈ 2.167 - 1 = 1.167. So z ≈ 1.17. That's a more moderate redshift. Then comoving distance would be... Well, let's check what the comoving distance is for z=1.17.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the drop is due to the Big Blue Bump peaking at some wavelength. The Big Blue Bump is the thermal emission from the accretion disk, which peaks in the UV. If the peak in the rest frame is, say, 1000 Å (0.1 microns), then observed at 790 nm (which is 7900 Å), z would be (7900 / 1000) - 1 = 7.9 - 1 = 6.9. So z ≈ 7. Again, very high redshift. But maybe that's not the case here.\n\nWait, the problem says that in the near-infrared and optical, there's a peak at 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths the flux drops. So if the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that would mean that the intrinsic spectrum has a peak at a longer wavelength than 790 nm. Wait, but that contradicts the redshift idea. If the intrinsic peak is at longer wavelength, then the observed peak would be even longer, but the problem says that at shorter wavelengths than 790 nm the flux drops. So maybe the intrinsic spectrum has a peak at 790 nm, but due to redshift, the observed peak is longer? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If the intrinsic peak is at λ_rest, then the observed peak is λ_rest*(1+z). If the observed peak is at 790 nm, and the intrinsic peak is at some shorter wavelength (so that the observed peak is longer), then the redshift is positive. However, if the intrinsic spectrum has a drop at shorter wavelengths, then perhaps the drop is due to a feature like the Lyman alpha forest or something else. But I need to figure out the redshift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the drop at shorter wavelengths is due to the redshifted Lyman alpha line or Lyman break. For example, if the Lyman break is at 912 Å rest frame, and it's observed at 790 nm, then z is as I calculated before ~7.7. But maybe there's another way. Alternatively, perhaps the quasar is at a redshift where the rest-frame UV is redshifted into the observed optical/near-IR. For example, if the rest-frame UV (say 1000 Å) is observed at 790 nm, then z = 7.9, which is again very high.\n\nBut if the drop at shorter wavelengths is due to the Lyman break, then the redshift is z ≈ (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. If λ_rest is 912 Å and λ_obs is 790 nm, then z ≈ 7900 / 912 - 1 ≈ 8.66 -1 = 7.66. So z ≈ 7.7.\n\nBut how does that relate to the comoving distance? Let me recall the formula for comoving distance in the Lambda-CDM model. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from redshift z to 0 of (1/(H(z)/H0)) * dz / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ + Ωk*(1+z)^2). Since the universe is flat, Ωk = 0. So the integral becomes D_C = (c/H0) * ∫₀^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')³ + ΩΛ).\n\nBut integrating that is not straightforward analytically. I might need to use a calculator or approximate the integral. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator for comoving distance given redshift and cosmological parameters.\n\nAlternatively, if I can estimate the redshift from the spectral feature, then I can use a comoving distance calculator.\n\nBut first, let's get back to the redshift estimation. The problem states that the peak is at 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths the flux drops significantly. If we assume that this drop is due to the Lyman break (rest frame λ_rest = 912 Å), then the observed break is at 790 nm. Therefore:\n\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1 = (790 nm / 912 Å) - 1. Wait, need to convert units. 912 Å is 91.2 nm. So 790 nm / 91.2 nm ≈ 8.66, so z ≈ 8.66 - 1 = 7.66. So z ≈ 7.7.\n\nAlternatively, if the drop is due to the Balmer break at 3646 Å rest frame. Then λ_obs = 790 nm = 7900 Å. So z = (7900 / 3646) - 1 ≈ 2.167 - 1 = 1.167. So z ≈ 1.17.\n\nBut which one is it? The problem says that the drop is at shorter wavelengths than 790 nm. If the Lyman break is at rest frame 912 Å, then the observed break is at 790 nm. So in the rest frame, the Lyman break is at 912 Å (UV), and in the observed frame, it's at 790 nm (near-IR). That would mean that the quasar is at z ≈ 7.7. But quasars at such high redshifts are rare, but they do exist. However, the comoving distance for z=7.7 would be very large. Let me check approximate comoving distances for different redshifts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the drop is due to the 4000 Å break (Balmer break), which is a feature in stellar populations. If the Balmer break is at rest frame 4000 Å (which is in the blue part of the optical spectrum), and it's observed at 790 nm (which is near-IR), then z = (7900 / 4000) - 1 ≈ 1.975 - 1 = 0.975. So z ≈ 0.98. That's a more moderate redshift.\n\nBut how do I know which spectral feature is responsible for the drop? The problem says \"at shorter wavelengths <790 nm the flux drops significantly.\" So if the drop is due to the Lyman break, then the intrinsic spectrum has a sharp drop at 912 Å, which is redshifted to 790 nm. Alternatively, if it's the Balmer break, then the drop is at 3646 Å rest frame, redshifted to 790 nm.\n\nBut quasars typically have very blue continua in the rest frame, so the Balmer break is not as prominent as in stellar populations. The Lyman break is more significant in high-redshift galaxies and quasars because it's caused by the absorption of photons with energy above the Lyman limit by neutral hydrogen. So if a quasar is at a redshift where the Lyman break is observed at 790 nm, that would imply a high redshift. However, if the quasar is at a lower redshift, the Lyman break would be in the UV, which is not observed here.\n\nGiven that the observed drop is at 790 nm (near-infrared), and assuming that the Lyman break is responsible, then z ≈ 7.7. But let's check what the comoving distance would be for that redshift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the drop is due to the rest-frame UV continuum drop-off. For example, if the quasar's continuum peaks in the UV and then drops off at shorter wavelengths. If the peak is at 1000 Å rest frame, and it's observed at 790 nm, then z = (790 / 0.1) - 1 = 7900 - 1 = 7899. That's impossible, so that can't be right. Wait, 790 nm is 7900 Å. If rest frame is 1000 Å, then z = (7900 / 1000) - 1 = 7.9 - 1 = 6.9. So z ≈ 6.9. So that's another possibility.\n\nBut how do I determine which one is the correct redshift? The problem doesn't give me more information. Maybe I need to think about typical features in quasar spectra.\n\nQuasars have broad emission lines, but the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Å rest frame. If the Lyman alpha line is redshifted to 790 nm, then z = (790 / 1.216) - 1 ≈ 649.8 - 1 ≈ 648. That's way too high. Not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the drop is not due to a spectral line or break, but due to the intrinsic SED of the quasar. The SED of a quasar typically has a big blue bump (thermal emission from the accretion disk) peaking in the UV, then a power-law component in the X-rays and radio. If the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near-IR, then the rest frame peak would be at a shorter wavelength. For example, if the quasar's SED in the rest frame peaks at 1000 Å (UV), then the observed peak would be at λ_obs = λ_rest*(1+z). So z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1 = (790 nm / 1000 Å) - 1 = (7900 Å / 1000 Å) - 1 = 7.9 - 1 = 6.9. So z ≈ 7. Again, high redshift.\n\nBut again, without knowing the intrinsic SED, how can I determine the redshift? The problem must be expecting me to assume a particular feature. Since the question mentions the drop at shorter wavelengths, and given that Lyman break is a sharp drop, maybe that's the intended approach.\n\nLet me proceed with the Lyman break assumption. So λ_rest = 912 Å, λ_obs = 790 nm. Therefore z ≈ 7.66.\n\nNow, I need to compute the comoving distance for z ≈ 7.7 with the given cosmological parameters: H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, flat universe.\n\nThe comoving distance is given by:\n\nD_C = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')³ + ΩΛ)\n\nThis integral doesn't have a closed-form solution for general Ωm and ΩΛ, so I need to evaluate it numerically. However, I can approximate it or use a calculator. Since I don't have a calculator here, maybe I can recall some approximate values or use an approximate formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for high redshifts, the comoving distance can be approximated by certain expressions. But let's think.\n\nFirst, let's convert the integral into something manageable. Let's denote the dimensionless Hubble parameter as E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ). So the integral becomes ∫₀^z dz' / E(z').\n\nGiven Ωm = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7, and flat universe.\n\nFor z = 7.7, let's try to compute the integral numerically.\n\nBut integrating from 0 to 7.7 is tedious by hand. Maybe I can use approximate values or known comoving distances for certain redshifts.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe:\n\nD_C = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')³ + (1 - Ωm))\n\nSince Ωm + ΩΛ = 1 in a flat universe.\n\nAlternatively, I can use an online calculator or refer to standard cosmological tables. But since I need to do this manually, perhaps I can use a Simpson's rule or trapezoidal rule approximation. However, without knowing the exact function values, it's difficult. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for high redshifts, dark energy dominates, but for z=7.7, the matter term is still significant.\n\nWait, let's consider that at z=7.7, the matter density is Ωm*(1+z)^3 = 0.3*(8.7)^3 ≈ 0.3*(658.5) ≈ 197.55. But ΩΛ is 0.7. Wait, no, the E(z) is sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ). Wait, Ωm*(1+z)^3 is 0.3*(8.7)^3 ≈ 0.3*658 ≈ 197.4, and ΩΛ is 0.7. Wait, but these are in terms of the density parameters. Wait, no, the E(z) is sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ). So for z=7.7, the argument inside the sqrt is 0.3*(8.7)^3 + 0.7 ≈ 0.3*658 + 0.7 ≈ 197.4 + 0.7 ≈ 198.1. So E(z) ≈ sqrt(198.1) ≈ 14.07. So the integrand at z=7.7 is 1/14.07 ≈ 0.071. But this is just the value at the upper limit. To integrate from 0 to 7.7, I need to consider the entire range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for z=0 to z=7.7, the universe transitions from matter-dominated to dark energy-dominated. But integrating this manually is going to be error-prone. Maybe I can approximate the integral by breaking it into parts where I can approximate E(z).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximate formula for comoving distance in a flat universe:\n\nD_C ≈ (c / H0) * [ (1 - ΩΛ)^(-1/3) * sinh( (3/2 * ΩΛ^(1/2) * H0 * t_0 ) ) ... ] but I don't remember the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3 and ΩΛ=0.7, the comoving distance to z≈7.7 is... I need to recall or estimate.\n\nWait, let me check some known values. For example, the comoving distance to z=1 is about 3.3 Gpc (using H0=70 km/s/Mpc). Wait, let me verify that. The formula for comoving distance is:\n\nD_C = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')³ + ΩΛ)\n\nLet me take H0=70 km/s/Mpc, c=3×10^5 km/s.\n\nSo c/H0 = 3×10^5 / 70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc ≈ 4.286 Gpc.\n\nNow, let's compute D_C for z=1:\n\nIntegral from 0 to 1 of dz' / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')³ + 0.7)\n\nLet me approximate this integral numerically.\n\nLet me use a simple trapezoidal rule with a few intervals.\n\nLet's divide the integral from z=0 to z=1 into, say, 4 intervals (z=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). Compute E(z) at each point.\n\nAt z=0: E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1)^3 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.3 + 0.7) = sqrt(1) = 1. So integrand is 1.\n\nAt z=0.25: 1+z=1.25, so E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1.25)^3 + 0.7). Compute 1.25^3=1.953. 0.3*1.953≈0.586. +0.7=1.286. sqrt(1.286)≈1.134. So integrand≈1/1.134≈0.882.\n\nAt z=0.5: 1+z=1.5. 1.5³=3.375. 0.3*3.375=1.0125 +0.7=1.7125. sqrt(1.7125)≈1.309. integrand≈0.764.\n\nAt z=0.75: 1+z=1.75. 1.75³≈5.359. 0.3*5.359≈1.608 +0.7=2.308. sqrt≈1.519. integrand≈0.658.\n\nAt z=1: 1+z=2. 2³=8. 0.3*8=2.4 +0.7=3.1. sqrt≈1.761. integrand≈0.568.\n\nNow, applying trapezoidal rule:\n\nIntegral ≈ Δz/2 * [f0 + 2f1 + 2f2 + 2f3 + f4]\n\nWhere Δz=0.25.\n\nSo:\n\n≈ 0.25/2 * [1 + 2*(0.882 + 0.764 + 0.658) + 0.568]\n\nCalculate inside:\n\n1 + 2*(0.882 + 0.764 + 0.658) + 0.568 = 1 + 2*(2.304) + 0.568 = 1 + 4.608 + 0.568 ≈ 6.176\n\nMultiply by 0.25/2 = 0.125:\n\n≈ 0.125 * 6.176 ≈ 0.772.\n\nSo the integral ≈ 0.772. Then D_C ≈ 4.286 Gpc * 0.772 ≈ 3.31 Gpc. Which is close to the expected value for z=1 (around 3.3 Gpc). So this seems reasonable.\n\nNow, for higher redshifts, let's try z=2.\n\nBut given that I need to compute up to z=7.7, which is quite high. Let's see if there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for very high redshifts, the integral can be approximated by considering when the universe transitions from matter to dark energy domination.\n\nBut maybe I can look up approximate values for comoving distance. Wait, if I recall, the comoving distance to z=10 is about 6-7 Gpc? Wait, no, that seems low. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3, the comoving distance to z=1 is ~3.3 Gpc, z=2 is ~6 Gpc, z=3 is ~8 Gpc, and then it starts to level off as dark energy starts to dominate. Wait, but with ΩΛ=0.7, dark energy becomes significant at higher redshifts. Wait, actually, at higher redshifts, the matter term dominates until a certain redshift, and then dark energy becomes important. For example, the matter-radiation equality happened at redshift ~3400, but here we are talking about matter vs. dark energy.\n\nThe redshift where the matter and dark energy densities are equal is given by:\n\n(1+z_eq)^3 * Ωm = ΩΛ\n\nSo (1+z_eq)^3 = ΩΛ / Ωm = 0.7 / 0.3 ≈ 2.333\n\nSo 1+z_eq ≈ 2.333^(1/3) ≈ 1.327, so z_eq ≈ 0.327. So at z≈0.3, the matter and dark energy densities are equal. For redshifts higher than that, matter dominates, and for lower, dark energy dominates.\n\nSo for z=7.7, which is much higher than z_eq≈0.3, the universe is matter-dominated. Therefore, in the integral from 0 to z=7.7, the universe is matter-dominated, so we can approximate E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3) = sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^(3/2). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ dz / [sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^(3/2)] = 1/sqrt(0.3) * ∫ dz / (1+z)^(3/2) = 1/sqrt(0.3) * [ -2 / sqrt(1+z) ] from 0 to z.\n\nSo evaluating from 0 to z:\n\n= 1/sqrt(0.3) * [ -2 / sqrt(1+z) + 2 / sqrt(1+0) ] = 1/sqrt(0.3) * [ 2 - 2 / sqrt(1+z) ]\n\nTherefore, the comoving distance approximation in the matter-dominated era is:\n\nD_C ≈ (c/H0) * [ 1/sqrt(Ωm) * (2 - 2 / sqrt(1+z)) ) ] = (c/H0) * [ 2 / sqrt(Ωm) * (1 - 1 / sqrt(1+z)) ]\n\nBut this is only valid if the entire redshift range is matter-dominated. Since our z=7.7 is well beyond z_eq≈0.3, this approximation might be okay.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\nGiven Ωm=0.3, so 1/sqrt(0.3) ≈ 1/0.5477 ≈ 1.826.\n\nSo D_C ≈ (c/H0) * [ 2 / sqrt(0.3) * (1 - 1 / sqrt(1+z)) ].\n\nPlugging in z=7.7:\n\nsqrt(1+z) = sqrt(8.7) ≈ 2.95.\n\n1 / sqrt(1+z) ≈ 0.339.\n\nSo 1 - 0.339 ≈ 0.661.\n\nThen D_C ≈ 4.286 Gpc * [ 2 * 1.826 * 0.661 ].\n\nFirst calculate 2 * 1.826 ≈ 3.652.\n\nThen 3.652 * 0.661 ≈ 2.413.\n\nSo D_C ≈ 4.286 * 2.413 ≈ 10.34 Gpc.\n\nBut this is an approximation assuming matter-dominated universe all the way. However, the actual integral would be less than this because at lower redshifts (below z=7.7), dark energy is present, so E(z) is larger, making the integrand smaller. Hence, the actual comoving distance would be less than 10.34 Gpc. But given that the options are up to 9 Gpc, maybe this is in the ballpark.\n\nBut wait, the approximation gave us ~10 Gpc, but the options are up to 9 Gpc. Also, note that this is an overestimate because we neglected the dark energy term in the integrand. Therefore, the real comoving distance would be less than 10.34 Gpc. So maybe around 9 Gpc? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a better approximation by splitting the integral into two parts: from z=0 to z=z_eq, where dark energy is significant, and from z=z_eq to z=7.7, where matter dominates.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calculator or refer to standard cosmological tables. Since I can't do that, let's try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the comoving distance for z=8 is approximately... Well, I can look up approximate values for comoving distance. For example, using the cosmology calculator at cosmocalc.wikidot.com, which is a common tool.\n\nBut since I can't access external resources, I need to recall or estimate. Let me try to remember that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3, H0=70 km/s/Mpc, the comoving distance to z=6 is approximately around 6.5 Gpc. Wait, let me see:\n\nAt z=6, the matter term is Ωm*(1+z)^3 = 0.3*(7)^3 = 0.3*343 = 102.9. The dark energy term is 0.7. So E(z) = sqrt(102.9 + 0.7) ≈ sqrt(103.6) ≈ 10.18. So the integrand at z=6 is 1/10.18 ≈ 0.098. Integrating up to z=6 would require knowing the integral value. If I use the approximation for matter-dominated universe, then D_C ≈ 4.286 * [2 / sqrt(0.3) * (1 - 1 / sqrt(7))]. sqrt(7) ≈ 2.6458, 1/sqrt(7) ≈ 0.378. 1 - 0.378 = 0.622. 2 / sqrt(0.3) ≈ 3.652. 3.652 * 0.622 ≈ 2.27. 4.286 * 2.27 ≈ 9.73 Gpc. But this is again an overestimate because we neglected dark energy. If the actual value is lower, maybe around 6.5 Gpc for z=6, then for z=7.7, it would be higher than that. But given that the approximation gives ~10 Gpc, but actual is less, maybe around 8-9 Gpc.\n\nGiven that the options are A:6, B:8, C:7, D:9. If the redshift is around 7.7, and the comoving distance is around 8-9 Gpc, then the answer could be B or D.\n\nBut let's check another angle. Suppose the redshift is lower. For example, if the drop is due to the Balmer break at 3646 Å rest frame, observed at 790 nm. Then z≈(7900/3646)-1≈2.167-1=1.167. So z≈1.17.\n\nFor z=1.17, let's compute the comoving distance.\n\nAgain, using the integral D_C = (c/H0) * ∫₀^z dz' / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')³ + 0.7).\n\nLet me approximate this integral numerically. Let's use trapezoidal rule with more intervals.\n\nFirst, c/H0 ≈ 4.286 Gpc as before.\n\nLet's approximate the integral from 0 to z=1.17.\n\nLet me divide the integral into, say, 5 intervals. Let's pick z=0, 0.234, 0.468, 0.702, 0.936, 1.17.\n\nCompute E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7) at each z.\n\nAt z=0: E= sqrt(0.3+0.7)=1, integrand=1.\n\nz=0.234: 1+z=1.234. (1.234)^3 ≈ 1.885. 0.3*1.885 ≈ 0.5655 +0.7=1.2655. sqrt≈1.125. integrand≈0.889.\n\nz=0.468: 1+z=1.468. (1.468)^3 ≈ 3.158. 0.3*3.158≈0.947 +0.7=1.647. sqrt≈1.283. integrand≈0.779.\n\nz=0.702: 1+z=1.702. (1.702)^3 ≈ 4.915. 0.3*4.915≈1.475 +0.7=2.175. sqrt≈1.475. integrand≈0.678.\n\nz=0.936: 1+z=1.936. (1.936)^3 ≈ 7.294. 0.3*7.294≈2.188 +0.7=2.888. sqrt≈1.699. integrand≈0.589.\n\nz=1.17: 1+z=2.17. (2.17)^3 ≈ 10.25. 0.3*10.25≈3.075 +0.7=3.775. sqrt≈1.943. integrand≈0.515.\n\nNow, applying trapezoidal rule with Δz=0.234:\n\nIntegral ≈ Δz/2 * [f0 + 2(f1 + f2 + f3 + f4) + f5]\n\n= 0.234/2 * [1 + 2*(0.889 + 0.779 + 0.678 + 0.589) + 0.515]\n\nCalculate inside:\n\nFirst, sum the middle terms: 0.889 + 0.779 + 0.678 + 0.589 = 2.935\n\nMultiply by 2: 5.87\n\nAdd f0 and f5: 1 + 5.87 + 0.515 = 7.385\n\nMultiply by Δz/2 = 0.234/2 = 0.117:\n\nIntegral ≈ 0.117 * 7.385 ≈ 0.864.\n\nThus, D_C ≈ 4.286 Gpc * 0.864 ≈ 3.70 Gpc.\n\nBut wait, for z=1.17, the comoving distance is around 3.7 Gpc? But earlier for z=1, it was 3.3 Gpc, so this seems reasonable. However, this is much less than the 8-9 Gpc we were considering for z=7.7. Since the options are up to 9 Gpc, if the redshift is 1.17, the comoving distance is only ~3.7 Gpc, which is not among the options (options are 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc). Therefore, this suggests that the redshift must be higher, leading to a larger comoving distance.\n\nTherefore, going back, if the drop is due to Lyman break at z≈7.7, leading to comoving distance ~8-9 Gpc, which matches the options B or D.\n\nBut how accurate is this approximation?\n\nEarlier, using the matter-dominated approximation for z=7.7, we got D_C ≈ 10.3 Gpc, but the actual value would be less due to dark energy. Let's try to estimate how much less.\n\nSuppose that from z=0 to z=7.7, the universe is mostly matter-dominated, but with some dark energy contribution. To get a better estimate, maybe I can use a better approximation.\n\nThe exact integral is:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) * ∫₀^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm(1+z')³ + ΩΛ)\n\nLet me use a better approximation by considering that for z > z_eq ≈ 0.3, the matter term dominates, so we can approximate the integral from z=0.3 to z=7.7 as matter-dominated, and compute the integral from 0 to 0.3 exactly.\n\nSo split the integral into two parts:\n\nIntegral from 0 to z_eq ≈ 0.3, and from z_eq to z=7.7.\n\nFor the first part, from 0 to 0.3, we can compute numerically. For the second part, from 0.3 to 7.7, approximate as matter-dominated.\n\nLet's compute the first part, from 0 to 0.3.\n\nLet me use trapezoidal rule with, say, 3 intervals: z=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.\n\nCompute E(z) at each point:\n\nAt z=0: E=1, integrand=1.\n\nz=0.1: 1+z=1.1. (1.1)^3=1.331. 0.3*1.331=0.399 +0.7=1.099. sqrt≈1.048. integrand≈0.954.\n\nz=0.2: 1+z=1.2. (1.2)^3=1.728. 0.3*1.728=0.518 +0.7=1.218. sqrt≈1.104. integrand≈0.906.\n\nz=0.3: 1+z=1.3. (1.3)^3=2.197. 0.3*2.197=0.659 +0.7=1.359. sqrt≈1.166. integrand≈0.858.\n\nApplying trapezoidal rule with Δz=0.1:\n\nIntegral ≈ 0.1/2 * [1 + 2*(0.954 + 0.906) + 0.858]\n\n= 0.05 * [1 + 2*(1.86) + 0.858] = 0.05 * [1 + 3.72 + 0.858] = 0.05 * 5.578 ≈ 0.279.\n\nNow, for the second part from z=0.3 to z=7.7, approximate as matter-dominated. The integral from a to b of dz / sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3) = [2 / (sqrt(Ωm)(1+z)^(1/2))] from a to b.\n\nWait, the integral of dz / (1+z)^{3/2} is -2 / sqrt(1+z) + C.\n\nSo, the integral from z=0.3 to z=7.7 is:\n\n[ -2 / sqrt(1+z) ] from 0.3 to 7.7 = -2 / sqrt(8.7) + 2 / sqrt(1.3) ≈ -2/2.95 + 2/1.14 ≈ -0.678 + 1.754 ≈ 1.076.\n\nBut this is multiplied by 1/sqrt(Ωm) = 1/sqrt(0.3) ≈ 1.826.\n\nSo this part contributes 1.826 * 1.076 ≈ 1.961.\n\nTherefore, the total integral is approximately 0.279 (from 0 to 0.3) + 1.961 (from 0.3 to 7.7) ≈ 2.24.\n\nThen, D_C ≈ 4.286 Gpc * 2.24 ≈ 9.6 Gpc.\n\nBut this is still an overestimate because in the second part we neglected the dark energy term, which would make the denominator larger, hence the integral smaller. So the actual integral would be less than 9.6 Gpc. Let's say maybe around 8-9 Gpc.\n\nGiven the options are 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc, and the approximation gives around 9.6, but actual is less, likely around 8-9. Hence, the answer could be B:8 Gpc or D:9 Gpc.\n\nBut how precise is this? Let me try to estimate the correction due to dark energy in the second part.\n\nThe integral from 0.3 to 7.7 was approximated as 1.961, but the actual integral would be less because we have ΩΛ=0.7 in the denominator. Let's estimate the correction.\n\nLet me pick a midpoint in the range, say z=4, and see what the integrand is.\n\nAt z=4: 1+z=5. Ωm*(1+z)^3 = 0.3*(125) = 37.5 + 0.7 = 38.2. sqrt(38.2) ≈ 6.18. integrand ≈ 0.162.\n\nIn the matter-dominated approximation, the integrand would be 1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3) = 1 / (sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^{3/2}) ≈ 1 / (0.5477*(5)^{1.5}) ≈ 1 / (0.5477*11.18) ≈ 1 / 6.13 ≈ 0.163. So the correction is negligible at z=4. Similarly, at higher redshifts, the dark energy term is negligible. At lower redshifts in this range (say z=1), the dark energy term is 0.7, and matter term is 0.3*(2)^3 = 2.4, total sqrt(2.4 + 0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=1.76, whereas matter-dominated would be sqrt(2.4)=1.55, so the integrand would be 1/1.76 ≈ 0.57 vs 1/1.55 ≈ 0.647. So the actual integrand is smaller than the matter-dominated approximation. Therefore, the integral from 0.3 to 7.7 is underestimated in our previous calculation? No, wait, if the actual integrand is smaller (because denominator is larger), then the integral is smaller. Hence, our previous approximation of 1.961 is an overestimate.\n\nTo estimate the correction, let's take the average of the integrand in the second part. Let's say that the average integrand is about 80% of the matter-dominated value. So instead of 1.961, it would be 1.961 * 0.8 ≈ 1.57. Then total integral would be 0.279 + 1.57 ≈ 1.85, leading to D_C ≈ 4.286 * 1.85 ≈ 7.93 Gpc, which is around 8 Gpc. Hence, option B.\n\nAlternatively, if the correction is less, say 90% of the value, then 1.961*0.9=1.765, total integral 0.279+1.765=2.044, D_C≈4.286*2.044≈8.76 Gpc, which is close to 9 Gpc.\n\nGiven these approximations, the comoving distance is likely between 8 and 9 Gpc. Given the options, both B and D are possible. To choose between them, perhaps I need a better estimation.\n\nLet me try to compute the integral from z=0.3 to z=7.7 more accurately by considering the dark energy term at a few points and adjusting the approximation.\n\nLet's take the midpoint of the range, say z=4, as before, and assume that the integrand is about 80% of the matter-dominated value. If we apply this correction uniformly, it might give a better estimate.\n\nPreviously, the matter-dominated integral from 0.3 to 7.7 was 1.961. If we reduce this by 20% due to dark energy, we get 1.569. Adding the first part 0.279 gives 1.848. D_C ≈ 4.286 * 1.848 ≈ 7.92 Gpc, which is close to 8 Gpc. Hence, option B.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the correction is only significant in the lower part of the range (z=0.3 to z=1), and less at higher redshifts, I can split the integral further.\n\nLet's split the integral from 0.3 to 1 and from 1 to 7.7.\n\nFor z=0.3 to z=1: compute numerically, and for z=1 to z=7.7: approximate with matter-dominated.\n\nFirst, compute from z=0.3 to z=1 numerically.\n\nLet's use trapezoidal rule with Δz=0.2: z=0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0.\n\nCompute E(z) at each point:\n\nz=0.3: already computed integrand≈0.858.\n\nz=0.5: 1+z=1.5. (1.5)^3=3.375. 0.3*3.375=1.0125 +0.7=1.7125. sqrt≈1.309. integrand≈0.764.\n\nz=0.7: 1+z=1.7. (1.7)^3≈4.913. 0.3*4.913≈1.474 +0.7=2.174. sqrt≈1.475. integrand≈0.678.\n\nz=0.9: 1+z=1.9. (1.9)^3≈6.859. 0.3*6.859≈2.058 +0.7=2.758. sqrt≈1.661. integrand≈0.602.\n\nz=1.0: integrand≈0.568 (as computed earlier).\n\nApplying trapezoidal rule with Δz=0.2:\n\nIntegral ≈ 0.2/2 * [f0 + 2(f1 + f2 + f3) + f4]\n\n= 0.1 * [0.858 + 2*(0.764 + 0.678 + 0.602) + 0.568]\n\nCalculate inside:\n\n2*(0.764 + 0.678 + 0.602) = 2*(2.044) = 4.088\n\nAdd f0 and f4: 0.858 + 4.088 + 0.568 = 5.514\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 0.5514.\n\nSo the integral from z=0.3 to z=1 is approximately 0.5514.\n\nNow, for the integral from z=1 to z=7.7, approximate as matter-dominated.\n\nThe integral from a to b of dz / sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3) = [ -2 / (sqrt(Ωm) * sqrt(1+z)) ] from a to b.\n\nSo from z=1 to z=7.7:\n\n= [ -2 / (sqrt(0.3)*sqrt(1+z)) ] from 1 to 7.7\n\n= -2 / (sqrt(0.3)*sqrt(8.7)) + 2 / (sqrt(0.3)*sqrt(2))\n\n≈ -2 / (0.5477*2.95) + 2 / (0.5477*1.414)\n\n≈ -2 / (1.616) + 2 / (0.775)\n\n≈ -1.238 + 2.581 ≈ 1.343.\n\nSo this part contributes 1.343.\n\nTherefore, total integral from 0.3 to 7.7 is approximately 0.5514 (from 0.3 to 1) + 1.343 (from 1 to 7.7) ≈ 1.894.\n\nAdding the integral from 0 to 0.3 (0.279), total integral ≈ 0.279 + 1.894 ≈ 2.173.\n\nThen D_C ≈ 4.286 * 2.173 ≈ 9.32 Gpc.\n\nBut this is still using the matter-dominated approximation from z=1 to z=7.7. To correct for dark energy in that range, let's estimate the correction. At z=1, the integrand with dark energy is 0.568 (as computed earlier), whereas in the matter-dominated approximation, it would be 1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+1)^3) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*8) = 1 / sqrt(2.4) ≈ 0.645. So the actual integrand is 0.568 / 0.645 ≈ 0.88, which is about 88% of the matter-dominated value. Similarly, at higher z, the correction becomes smaller. Assuming an average correction factor of 0.9 for the range from z=1 to z=7.7, we would multiply the 1.343 by 0.9, getting 1.209. Then total integral from 0.3 to 7.7 would be 0.5514 + 1.209 ≈ 1.760. Adding the 0.279 gives 2.039. D_C ≈ 4.286 * 2.039 ≈ 8.74 Gpc, which is close to 8.7 Gpc, so option D:9 Gpc is slightly higher, but B:8 Gpc is also close.\n\nGiven that the approximation with correction gives around 8.7 Gpc, which is between 8 and 9, and considering that the actual value might be slightly less due to dark energy, maybe the answer is B:8 Gpc.\n\nHowever, another way to check is to recall that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3, H0=70 km/s/Mpc, the comoving distance to z=8 is approximately around 8-9 Gpc. For example, using the cosmology calculator at cosmocalc.wikidot.com, if I set H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7, and calculate comoving distance to z=8, it would give a value. Let me try to recall or estimate.\n\nWait, I remember that for H0=70, Ωm=0.3, the comoving distance to z=1 is ~3.3 Gpc, z=2 ~5.5 Gpc, z=3 ~7 Gpc, z=4 ~8 Gpc, z=5 ~9 Gpc, and so on. Wait, but this seems inconsistent with previous calculations. Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nActually, comoving distance increases with redshift, but the rate depends on the cosmology. For a flat universe with Ωm=0.3, the comoving distance to z=1 is about 3.3 Gpc, as we calculated. At higher redshifts, the distance increases, but the rate depends on the matter and dark energy densities.\n\nFor example, at z=2, the comoving distance is approximately 6 Gpc, at z=3 it's about 7.5 Gpc, at z=4 about 8.5 Gpc, and at z=5 about 9 Gpc. If the quasar is at z=7.7, which is higher than z=5, the comoving distance would be greater than 9 Gpc. However, our approximation gave around 8.7 Gpc, which is slightly less than 9 Gpc, possibly due to the correction for dark energy.\n\nBut if the actual value for z=8 is around 9 Gpc, and our quasar is at z=7.7, which is slightly less than z=8, then the comoving distance would be slightly less than 9 Gpc, say 8.8 Gpc, which rounds to 9 Gpc. Hence, option D:9 Gpc.\n\nBut earlier, with corrections, we estimated around 8.7 Gpc, which is closer to 9 Gpc than 8 Gpc. Given that the options are 6, 7, 8, 9, and our approximation with correction is around 8.7, which is closest to 9 Gpc, I think the correct answer is D:9 Gpc.\n\nHowever, there's uncertainty in the redshift estimation. If the drop is due to a different feature, the redshift could be different. For example, if it's the Balmer break at z=1.17, giving 3.7 Gpc, which is not among the options, so that's not it. If it's the Lyman break at z=7.7, leading to ~9 Gpc, which is option D.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D:9 Gpc.\n</think>"}
