Let me start by recalling how to balance equations. The goal is to have the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation.\n\nFirst, let me write down the unbalanced equation again and count the atoms on each side. \n\nLeft side (reactants):\n- H2S: 2 H, 1 S\n- KOH: 1 K, 1 O, 1 H\n\nRight side (products):\n- K2S: 2 K, 1 S\n- H2O: 2 H, 1 O\n\nWait, but the left side has two compounds and the right side also has two. Let me count all the atoms together.\n\nLeft side total:\nHydrogen (H): 2 (from H2S) + 1 (from KOH) = 3 H\nSulfur (S): 1 (from H2S)\nPotassium (K): 1 (from KOH)\nOxygen (O): 1 (from KOH)\n\nRight side total:\nHydrogen (H): 2 (from H2O)\nSulfur (S): 1 (from K2S)\nPotassium (K): 2 (from K2S)\nOxygen (O): 1 (from H2O)\n\nSo comparing both sides:\n\nHydrogen: 3 on left vs 2 on right\nSulfur: 1 each\nPotassium: 1 left vs 2 right\nOxygen: 1 each\n\nSo the problem is with hydrogen and potassium. Let me try to balance potassium first because it's in K2S on the right. Since there are 2 K on the right, I need 2 KOH on the left. Let me adjust that.\n\nSo if I put a 2 in front of KOH:\n\nLeft side now:\nH2S: 2 H, 1 S\n2 KOH: 2 K, 2 O, 2 H\n\nTotal left:\nHydrogen: 2 (H2S) + 2 (from KOH) = 4 H\nSulfur: 1\nPotassium: 2\nOxygen: 2\n\nRight side:\nK2S: 2 K, 1 S\nH2O: 2 H, 1 O\n\nNow, let's check again:\n\nHydrogen: left has 4, right has 2. So need to balance H. Let's look at H2O. If I have more H2O, that would add H and O. Let me see. Suppose I put a 2 in front of H2O. Then H2O becomes 2 H2O, which gives 4 H and 2 O. Let me check:\n\nRight side with 2 H2O:\nHydrogen: 2*2 = 4 H\nOxygen: 2*1 = 2 O\nPotassium: still 2 K\nSulfur: still 1\n\nLeft side:\nHydrogen: 4\nOxygen: 2\nPotassium: 2\nSulfur: 1\n\nSo now H and O and K are balanced. Let's check S. Left has 1 S in H2S, right has 1 S in K2S. That's balanced. Wait, but what about the H? Left has 4 H (from H2S and 2 KOH), right has 4 H (from 2 H2O). That's balanced. So the equation would be:\n\nH2S + 2 KOH → K2S + 2 H2O\n\nLet me check all elements again:\n\nLeft side:\nH: 2 (H2S) + 2*1 (KOH) = 2 + 2 = 4\nS: 1\nK: 2*1 = 2\nO: 2*1 = 2\n\nRight side:\nH: 2*2 (from H2O) = 4\nS: 1\nK: 2\nO: 2*1 = 2\n\nYes, all elements are balanced. So the balanced equation is H2S + 2 KOH → K2S + 2 H2O. Let me just make sure there are no other elements or coefficients that need adjusting. The coefficients are 1 for H2S, 2 for KOH, 1 for K2S, and 2 for H2O. That seems correct. I don't see any other imbalances. So the balanced equation should be correct.\n</think>"}
