Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is: a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle A is given as 300 MeV/c². The question is asking for the velocity of particle A, with options from A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens in particle annihilation processes. When a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other particles. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is probably negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So the total energy available for creating the A particles would come mainly from the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton.\n\nLet me note down the given information:\n\n- The reaction: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻\n- The antiproton is slowly moving (so its kinetic energy is negligible)\n- Mass of A: m_A c² = 300 MeV\n- Need to find velocity of particle A, options given.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total energy available in the center-of-momentum frame, which in this case, since the antiproton is moving slowly, probably the lab frame is the same as the center-of-momentum frame? Wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe it's colliding with a proton at rest? Or are they both moving slowly? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. But the proton's state isn't specified. Wait, maybe the proton is at rest? Or maybe both are moving slowly?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". It doesn't say anything about the proton. But in annihilation processes, usually, if one particle is moving and the other is at rest, but here it's a proton and antiproton. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it? Or maybe both are moving slowly towards each other?\n\nBut since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe we can assume that the proton is at rest? So the total energy would be the rest energy of the proton plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton plus its rest energy. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, total energy is approximately 2 * m_p c², where m_p is the proton mass.\n\nBut what's the proton mass in MeV? Let me recall that the proton mass is approximately 938 MeV/c². Let me check that. Yes, the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c². So the total rest energy available is roughly 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV.\n\nNow, this energy is converted into the rest mass energy and kinetic energy of the four A particles. The problem is asking for the velocity of particle A. So I need to find the velocity of each A particle produced in the annihilation.\n\nBut first, let me think about conservation laws. In the annihilation process, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is probably small. But since the problem doesn't specify the initial velocity of the antiproton, maybe we can assume that the total initial momentum is negligible? Or perhaps the antiproton is moving slowly enough that its kinetic energy is negligible, but its momentum isn't? Hmm.\n\nWait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then its kinetic energy is small, so maybe the total energy is approximately 2 * m_p c². But the products are four A particles. Let me calculate the total rest mass energy of the products. Each A particle has mass 300 MeV/c². So four of them would be 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. Since 1200 MeV is less than 1876 MeV, there is some leftover energy which becomes kinetic energy of the A particles.\n\nBut how is this energy distributed? Also, momentum has to be conserved. Since the initial momentum is small (antiproton is moving slowly), the total momentum of the products should be approximately equal to the initial momentum. But since there are four particles produced, their momenta must add up to the initial momentum. However, if the initial momentum is small, maybe the products are emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out? Or maybe they are all moving in the same direction? But given that there are two positive and two negative A particles, maybe they are produced in pairs going in opposite directions?\n\nBut without knowing the exact dynamics, maybe we can assume that the collision is symmetric and that the kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four particles? Or perhaps all the kinetic energy is shared equally? Wait, but in reality, the way the particles are produced depends on the specifics of the interaction. However, since the problem is giving us a multiple-choice question, perhaps we can make some simplifying assumptions.\n\nSince the initial momentum is small, maybe we can assume that the total kinetic energy is shared equally among the four particles? Or perhaps each particle gets the same kinetic energy? Alternatively, maybe the kinetic energy is such that each particle has the same speed, and the total energy is the sum of their energies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the collision is perfectly symmetric and that all the kinetic energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the four A particles. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total energy available. The rest energy of proton and antiproton is 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV. The rest energy of the four A particles is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. Therefore, the remaining energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. This must be the total kinetic energy of the four A particles. Assuming that the kinetic energy is shared equally among them, each A particle would have a kinetic energy of 676 / 4 = 169 MeV.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? If the kinetic energy is shared equally? But how do we know how the energy is shared? Maybe we need to consider the momentum conservation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to consider that in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly towards a proton at rest, then the center-of-momentum frame isn't the same as the lab frame. However, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame is approximately the center-of-momentum frame? Wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then its velocity is much less than c, so maybe the total momentum is small. But for the proton and antiproton to annihilate, they need to collide. If the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. After the collision, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is small enough that we can approximate the final particles' momenta as being in opposite directions to cancel out? But with four particles, perhaps they are emitted isotropically? Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach. Since the problem is multiple choice, and the answer is likely to be determined by considering that all the available energy (after accounting for the rest mass of the A particles) is converted into kinetic energy, and assuming that each particle has the same kinetic energy, then we can calculate the velocity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to use relativistic energy and momentum conservation.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's define the problem in terms of energy and momentum conservation.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Proton mass: m_p = 938 MeV/c²\n\n- Antiproton mass: same as proton, m_p̄ = 938 MeV/c²\n\n- A particle mass: m_A = 300 MeV/c²\n\nGiven that the antiproton is slowly moving, so its kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, its total energy is approximately its rest energy: E_p̄ ≈ m_p̄ c² = 938 MeV.\n\nThe proton is presumably at rest? If the antiproton is moving slowly towards a proton at rest, then the proton's energy is just its rest energy: E_p = m_p c² = 938 MeV.\n\nTherefore, total initial energy: E_initial = 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV.\n\nTotal initial momentum: p_initial. If the proton is at rest, then p_initial is just the momentum of the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can approximate its momentum using classical mechanics: p = m_p̄ v. But since v << c, p ≈ m_p̄ v. However, without knowing the exact velocity, maybe we need another approach.\n\nBut given that the kinetic energy is negligible, the velocity is small, so maybe the initial momentum is also small compared to the energy. However, in relativity, energy and momentum are related by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². For the proton at rest, its momentum is zero. For the antiproton, if its kinetic energy is negligible, then its total energy is approximately m_p̄ c², so its momentum would be p = sqrt( (E/c)² - (m c)² ) ≈ sqrt( (m_p̄² c² / c² ) - m_p̄² c² )? Wait, no, that would be zero. Wait, if the total energy is approximately m_p̄ c², then the momentum is sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) = sqrt( (m_p̄² c² / c² ) - m_p̄² c² )? Wait, that seems like zero. Wait, no:\n\nWait, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So if E ≈ m c², then (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ 0. Therefore, p ≈ 0. Therefore, if the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, then its momentum is negligible. Therefore, total initial momentum is approximately zero.\n\nTherefore, in the initial state, total momentum is approximately zero. Therefore, in the final state, the total momentum must also be zero. Therefore, the four A particles must be produced in such a way that their total momentum is zero. How can that happen? Well, maybe they are produced in pairs moving in opposite directions. For example, two particles moving in one direction and two in the opposite, or maybe two pairs moving in opposite directions. Since there are two positive and two negative particles, maybe they are emitted in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n\nBut regardless of the exact configuration, the key point is that the total momentum is zero, so each particle's momentum must be balanced by another's. Therefore, assuming that the particles are emitted in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, then each pair would have equal and opposite momenta.\n\nBut since there are four particles, perhaps each particle has momentum p, and there are two particles going in one direction and two in the opposite? Wait, but that would give total momentum 2p - 2p = 0. So that works. Alternatively, each particle could have different momenta, but arranged symmetrically.\n\nBut without knowing the exact configuration, how can we proceed? Maybe we can assume that all four particles have the same speed and same magnitude of momentum, but arranged such that their vector sum is zero. For example, if they are emitted at 90-degree angles relative to each other in the plane, or in three dimensions. However, for simplicity, perhaps the problem assumes that all four particles are emitted with the same speed, and their momenta cancel out vectorially.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A, it's likely that all particles have the same speed. Therefore, we can proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, assuming that all four A particles have the same kinetic energy and same speed, and their total momentum is zero. Then, the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the four particles.\n\nSo, total energy after collision: E_final = 4 * γ m_A c², where γ is the Lorentz factor for each A particle.\n\nTotal initial energy: E_initial = 2 * m_p c² = 1876 MeV.\n\nTherefore, 4 * γ * 300 MeV = 1876 MeV.\n\nSolving for γ:\n\nγ = 1876 / (4 * 300) = 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.5633...\n\nSo γ ≈ 1.5633.\n\nNow, we can find the velocity corresponding to this γ.\n\nWe know that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).\n\nSo, solving for v:\n\nsqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ\n\n1 - v²/c² = 1 / γ²\n\nv²/c² = 1 - 1 / γ²\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / γ²)\n\nPlugging in γ ≈ 1.5633:\n\nFirst calculate 1 / γ² ≈ 1 / (2.443) ≈ 0.4093\n\nThen 1 - 0.4093 ≈ 0.5907\n\nThen sqrt(0.5907) ≈ 0.7686\n\nSo v ≈ 0.7686 c ≈ 0.77 c.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 0.77c. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, total initial energy is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Correct.\n\nTotal rest mass of the A particles is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. Therefore, the kinetic energy available is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. If this is all converted into kinetic energy of the four A particles, then each has 676 / 4 = 169 MeV of kinetic energy. But in this approach, we assumed that the total energy of the A particles is 4 * γ m_A c², which includes both rest mass and kinetic energy. Therefore, the total energy is 1876 MeV, so γ is calculated as above.\n\nBut another way to think about it is that the kinetic energy per particle is (γ - 1) m_A c². Therefore, total kinetic energy is 4*(γ - 1)*m_A c² = 676 MeV. Therefore:\n\n4*(γ - 1)*300 MeV = 676 MeV\n\n(γ - 1) = 676 / (4 * 300) ≈ 676 / 1200 ≈ 0.5633\n\nTherefore, γ ≈ 1 + 0.5633 ≈ 1.5633, same as before. Therefore, same result.\n\nSo, same γ ≈ 1.5633, leading to v ≈ 0.77c. Which is option C. But let me check the calculation again.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2):\n\nFirst compute γ²:\n\nγ ≈ 1.5633, so γ² ≈ (1.5633)^2. Let me calculate that:\n\n1.5^2 = 2.25, 0.0633^2 ≈ 0.004, and cross terms 2*1.5*0.0633 ≈ 0.1899. So total approx 2.25 + 0.1899 + 0.004 ≈ 2.4439. Which matches the previous value. Therefore, 1/γ² ≈ 0.4092.\n\nThen 1 - 0.4092 = 0.5908. Square root of 0.5908 is approximately 0.7686. So 0.7686c ≈ 0.77c. So option C is 0.77c.\n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA: 0.86c\n\nB: 0.91c\n\nC: 0.77c\n\nD: 0.96c\n\nSo according to this calculation, the answer is C. However, let me check if there's an error in my assumption.\n\nWait, the key assumption here is that all four particles have the same energy, which is valid if the collision is symmetric and the particles are produced with equal energy. But is there another way to approach this problem where the answer is different?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the particles are produced in pairs with opposite momenta, but with different energies? For example, maybe two particles moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but with different speeds? But then how would we determine the speed? Without more information, it's impossible to know. Therefore, the most straightforward assumption is that all four particles have the same energy and speed, leading to answer C.\n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation of γ. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal energy available: 1876 MeV.\n\nTotal rest mass of products: 1200 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the total kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. If this is shared equally among four particles, each has 169 MeV of kinetic energy.\n\nKinetic energy K = (γ - 1) m_A c².\n\nSo γ = 1 + K / (m_A c²) = 1 + 169 / 300 ≈ 1 + 0.5633 ≈ 1.5633. Same as before. Then velocity calculation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) => sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ ≈ 1 / 1.5633 ≈ 0.64.\n\nThen 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096 => v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 => v ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.768 c ≈ 0.77c. So yes, 0.77c is the answer.\n\nBut let me check with exact numbers.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.5904). Let's see:\n\n0.768² = 0.59 (approx). Let me compute 0.77² = 0.5929. Which is close to 0.5904. Therefore, sqrt(0.5904) is slightly less than 0.77. Let me compute:\n\nLet me take x = 0.77, x² = 0.5929.\n\nWe have 0.5904 is 0.5929 - 0.0025. So we need to find x such that x² = 0.5904. Let me approximate using linear approximation.\n\nLet f(x) = x². We know f(0.77) = 0.5929. We want to find Δx such that f(0.77 + Δx) = 0.5904.\n\nApproximately, f'(x) = 2x. At x = 0.77, f'(x) = 1.54.\n\nΔx ≈ (0.5904 - 0.5929)/1.54 ≈ (-0.0025)/1.54 ≈ -0.00162.\n\nTherefore, x ≈ 0.77 - 0.00162 ≈ 0.7684. So approximately 0.768c, which is 0.77c when rounded to two decimal places. So answer C.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach where maybe the kinetic energy isn't shared equally. For example, if the particles are produced with different energies, but due to momentum conservation, perhaps they have different velocities. However, without more information, this is impossible to calculate. Therefore, the standard approach is to assume that the kinetic energy is shared equally, leading to answer C.\n\nBut let me think again about the initial assumption. We assumed that the total energy of the products is 4 * γ m_A c². But is that correct?\n\nYes, because each particle has energy γ m_A c², so four particles would have 4 * γ m_A c². Since the total initial energy is 1876 MeV, equating them gives the value of γ. Therefore, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in assuming that the rest energy of the products is 1200 MeV? Let me check:\n\nEach A particle has mass 300 MeV/c². There are four of them: 2 A+ and 2 A-. Assuming that A+ and A- have the same mass as given. So yes, total rest mass is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. Therefore, answer is C: 0.77c.\n\nBut let me check if the problem says that the antiproton is slowly moving. Does that mean that the proton is at rest? Or is the antiproton moving slowly in the center-of-momentum frame?\n\nWait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the collision is in the center-of-momentum frame? Wait, if both the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta, then that would be the center-of-momentum frame. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe it's not. However, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. It doesn't specify relative to what. If it's in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, then the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. In that case, the center-of-momentum frame is not the same as the lab frame. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame is approximately the center-of-momentum frame?\n\nBut in reality, if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-momentum frame is moving at a velocity close to half the antiproton's velocity. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can ignore that difference?\n\nBut in our previous calculation, we assumed that the total initial momentum is zero, which would be the case in the center-of-momentum frame. However, if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total initial momentum is not zero. Therefore, there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. If the antiproton is moving slowly towards a proton at rest, then the initial momentum is not zero. Therefore, the final momentum must equal the initial momentum. Therefore, our previous assumption that the total momentum of the final particles is zero might be incorrect.\n\nThis complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nCase 1: Assume that the collision is in the center-of-momentum frame, where total initial momentum is zero. Then, the total final momentum is zero, leading to our previous calculation of velocity ≈ 0.77c.\n\nCase 2: The collision is in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Then, the initial momentum is not zero, and the final momentum must equal that initial momentum. Therefore, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum.\n\nBut since the antiproton is moving slowly, let's try to calculate the initial momentum.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nProton at rest: p_p = 0.\n\nAntiproton moving with velocity v, which is slow (v << c). Therefore, its momentum is approximately p_p̄ ≈ m_p̄ v.\n\nTotal initial momentum p_initial ≈ m_p̄ v.\n\nSince v is small, let's use non-relativistic approximations for the antiproton. However, the total energy is still E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².\n\nNow, after the collision, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to p_initial ≈ m_p̄ v.\n\nBut if v is very small, then p_initial is small. Let's assume that the four A particles are produced with some momentum p_A each, arranged such that their total momentum is p_initial. But without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to say. However, if p_initial is small, maybe we can approximate that the kinetic energy is still mostly shared equally, and the velocity is still approximately 0.77c, with a small adjustment due to the momentum.\n\nBut since the problem gives us multiple-choice answers and the options are not extremely close, maybe the difference is negligible, and the answer is still C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the center-of-momentum frame, where the total initial momentum is zero, leading to the velocity of 0.77c. Therefore, answer C.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's try to analyze the lab frame scenario.\n\nIn the lab frame, proton at rest, antiproton moving with velocity v, which is slow. Let's compute the initial momentum and energy.\n\nTotal initial energy: E_initial = E_p + E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² + (γ m_p̄ c²). But since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). Therefore, E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p̄ c² + (1/2) m_p̄ v². Since m_p = m_p̄, this is ≈ 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².\n\nBut since the antiproton is moving slowly, the kinetic energy (1/2) m_p v² is negligible compared to 2 m_p c². So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c², same as before.\n\nTotal initial momentum p_initial ≈ m_p v (non-relativistic approximation).\n\nAfter the collision, the four A particles have total momentum p_final = p_initial ≈ m_p v.\n\nAssuming that the four A particles are produced with some momenta such that their total is p_initial. Let's assume that they are produced in such a way that three of them have negligible momentum and one carries away the total momentum? But that's unlikely. More realistically, they might be produced with some symmetric configuration but with a small net momentum.\n\nHowever, since p_initial is small, maybe we can approximate that the kinetic energy is still approximately the same as in the center-of-momentum frame, and the velocity is still approximately 0.77c. The small momentum would only cause a slight increase in kinetic energy for some particles and decrease for others, but since the options are given, and our previous calculation gives 0.77c which is option C, and the other options are higher, it's possible that the answer is still C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach where we need to consider that all the available energy is used to create the A particles' kinetic energy, but taking into account relativistic speeds.\n\nWait, but we already did that. We calculated γ ≈ 1.56, leading to v ≈ 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the antiproton is at rest and the proton is moving? Wait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". It doesn't say anything about the proton. Maybe the proton is moving? But that seems unlikely. Usually, in such problems, if one particle is mentioned as moving, the other is assumed at rest unless stated otherwise.\n\nBut given that the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\", it's more natural to assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. Therefore, the lab frame is the frame where the proton is at rest.\n\nBut in this case, the total initial momentum is not zero. However, since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate that the total initial momentum is small, and therefore, the final particles have approximately zero total momentum, similar to the center-of-momentum frame? That might not be valid, but given that the kinetic energy is negligible, maybe the problem expects us to ignore that and proceed with the previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved in the center-of-momentum frame, where total momentum is zero, leading to answer C.\n\nGiven that the problem is likely intended for an introductory particle physics or relativity course, and given that the options are standard, I think that the expected approach is to assume that all the available energy goes into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the four A particles, with total momentum zero, leading to velocity ≈ 0.77c. Hence, answer C.\n\nBut just to check, let me see if any other approach could lead to a different answer.\n\nSuppose that instead of four particles, we had two particles. For example, if the annihilation produced two particles instead of four. Then, the calculation would be different. But here it's four particles.\n\nAnother check: Let's compute the exact value of v for γ ≈ 1.5633.\n\nγ = 1.5633.\n\nSo:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(γ²)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2.443)) ≈ c * sqrt(1 - 0.409) ≈ c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.7687 ≈ 0.7687c ≈ 0.77c.\n\nYes, so answer C.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a miscalculation in assuming that all energy goes into the four particles, but that seems correct because energy is conserved.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: 0.77c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
