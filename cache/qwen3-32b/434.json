So, the question is about Chen Yuxi diving from the 10-meter platform, right? She does a handstand and then descends. The problem says that in the first 5 meters, she completes some technical moves, and then in the next 5 meters, she adjusts her posture. They want to know the time she took for the posture adjustment, assuming the whole descent is free fall with gravity at 10 m/s². The options are from 0.2s to 1.4s. \n\nAlright, so first, since it's free fall, we can use the equations of motion under constant acceleration. The key here is probably to find the time it takes to fall the first 5 meters and then the time to fall the next 5 meters, and subtract them to find the time difference, which would be the time she took for posture adjustment during the second 5 meters. \n\nWait, but how exactly? Let me think. Free fall equations... The distance fallen under gravity can be calculated using the formula:\n\ns = ut + ½ a t²\n\nBut here, she starts from rest, right? Because she does a handstand and then descends. So initial velocity u is 0. So the formula simplifies to s = ½ g t². \n\nSo for the first 5 meters, we can solve for t1:\n\n5 = 0.5 * 10 * t1²\n\nSimplify that: 5 = 5 * t1² → t1² = 1 → t1 = 1 second. \n\nOkay, so she takes 1 second to fall the first 5 meters. \n\nNow, for the entire 10 meters, let's find the total time t_total:\n\n10 = 0.5 * 10 * t_total² → 10 = 5 t_total² → t_total² = 2 → t_total = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414 seconds. \n\nSo the total time to fall 10 meters is about 1.414 seconds. Therefore, the time taken during the second 5 meters (from 5m to 10m) would be t_total - t1 = sqrt(2) - 1 ≈ 1.414 - 1 = 0.414 seconds. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 0.4s, which is approximately 0.414s. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I oversimplified? Let me make sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the time to reach 5m and then the time to reach 10m and subtract. Which is exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, someone might think that the posture adjustment is during the last 5 meters, but since she's falling, the time for the last 5 meters isn't the same as the first 5 meters. Since acceleration is involved, she's going faster, so the time to cover the second 5 meters is less. \n\nAnother way to check: Let's compute the velocity at 5m, then compute the time to go from 5m to 10m. \n\nAt 5m, velocity v = sqrt(2 g s) = sqrt(2*10*5) = sqrt(100) = 10 m/s. \n\nThen, for the next 5m, using the equation:\n\ns = ut + ½ a t²\n\nHere, initial velocity u is 10 m/s, displacement s = 5m, acceleration a = 10 m/s².\n\nSo 5 = 10*t + 0.5*10*t² → 5 = 10t + 5t² → divide both sides by 5:\n\n1 = 2t + t² → t² + 2t - 1 = 0\n\nSolving quadratic equation: t = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 4)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(8)] / 2 = [-2 ± 2*sqrt(2)] / 2 = -1 ± sqrt(2). Taking the positive root, t = -1 + 1.414 ≈ 0.414 seconds. Same result. So that's about 0.414s, which is approximately 0.4s. So answer is B. \n\nBut let me check if the question is about the first 5m and then the subsequent 5m. So first 5m takes 1s, then the next 5m takes ~0.41s. Therefore, the time for posture adjustment is 0.4s. So option B. \n\nAlternatively, someone might have thought to just compute the time for 5m, but that's the first 5m. But the question says she completes technical moves in the first 5m and then the subsequent 5m for adjustment. Therefore, the adjustment is during the second 5m, which takes less time. \n\nTherefore, answer is B. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
