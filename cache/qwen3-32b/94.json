The user is asking which of the four options (A to D) is correct regarding chemical concepts like isotopes, homologues, allotropes, and whether two compounds are the same. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions of each term. Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. So isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element. Homologues are compounds in the same homologous series, which usually means they differ by a CH2 group and have similar chemical properties. \n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: C60 and C70 are isotopes of each other. Hmm. Wait, isotopes are about the same element with different neutron counts. But C60 and C70 are both forms of carbon, but they are different allotropes. Each molecule consists of carbon atoms arranged differently (buckyballs vs. different structures). So they are not isotopes, but allotropes. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: C2H6 and C6H14 are homologues. Let me think. C2H6 is ethane, and C6H14 is hexane. Both are alkanes. Alkanes form a homologous series where each member differs by a CH2 group. Ethane is C2H6, propane C3H8, butane C4H10, pentane C5H12, hexane C6H14. So yes, ethane and hexane are part of the same homologous series, differing by four CH2 groups. Therefore, they are homologues. So B seems correct. But wait, the definition of homologues is that they are part of the same series with a common general formula and each adjacent member differs by CH2. But even if they are not adjacent, they are still considered homologues. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: CO and CO2 are allotropes. Allotropes are different forms of the same element. But CO is carbon monoxide, which is a compound of carbon and oxygen. CO2 is carbon dioxide, also a compound. Allotropes are different structures of the same element, like O2 and O3 (oxygen and ozone), or diamond and graphite. So CO and CO2 are not allotropes, they are different compounds. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: CH3COOH and CH3OOCH are the same. Let me write them out. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. The other one, CH3OOCH... Wait, the formula might be written as CH3COOCH3? Wait, the user wrote CH3OOCH. Let me check. The correct formula for methyl acetate (an ester) would be CH3COOCH3. But if written as CH3OOCH, perhaps that's a different structure? Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Let me parse the formula again. The second compound is CH3OOCH. Let's count the atoms. Carbon: 2 (CH3 and OOC?), but maybe the formula is supposed to represent an ester. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, which is CH3-C(=O)-OH. The other compound, if it's CH3OOCH, perhaps it's CH3-O-O-CH3? No, that would be dimethyl peroxide. Or maybe it's a different functional group. Wait, maybe the correct formula for the ester is CH3COOCH3 (methyl acetate), which is formed from acetic acid and methanol. But if the formula is written as CH3OOCH, maybe it's missing a carbon? Let me check. Acetic acid has 2 carbons. Methyl acetate would have 3 carbons: CH3COOCH3. Wait, the formula given for the second compound is CH3OOCH. If it's CH3OOCH, that's C2H4O3? Wait, let me count. CH3 is 1 carbon, 3 hydrogens. Then OOCH would be O-O-CH? Wait, maybe the formula is written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound. If the two compounds are acetic acid and methyl acetate, they are structural isomers. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, and methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3. So they have the same molecular formula but different structures? Wait, no. Acetic acid is C2H4O2. Methyl acetate is also C3H6O2? Wait, no. Let me check the molecular formulas. Acetic acid is C2H4O2. Methyl acetate is C3H6O2. Wait, no. Let me recalculate. Acetic acid: CH3COOH: Carbon: 2, Hydrogen: 4 (from CH3) + 2 (from OH) = 4? Wait, no. CH3COOH is C2H4O2. Methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3: Carbon: 3 (CH3, COO, CH3?), no. Wait, CH3COOCH3 is C3H6O2. So their molecular formulas are different. Therefore, they are not the same compound. So option D is incorrect. Therefore, D is wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B.\n</think>"}
