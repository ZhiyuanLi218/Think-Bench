The options are (a), (b), (c), (d), and the answer choices are combinations of these. The question is asking which of these states are entangled, meaning they can't be written as a product of two individual qubit states. Let me recall how to determine if a state is entangled.\n\nFirst, a two-qubit state is entangled if it cannot be expressed as a tensor product of two single-qubit states. For a general two-qubit state:\n\n|ψ⟩ = α|00⟩ + β|01⟩ + γ|10⟩ + δ|11⟩\n\nThis can be written as a product state if there exist α₁, α₂, β₁, β₂ such that:\n\n|ψ⟩ = (α₁|0⟩ + α₂|1⟩) ⊗ (β₁|0⟩ + β₂|1⟩) = α₁β₁|00⟩ + α₁β₂|01⟩ + α₂β₁|10⟩ + α₂β₂|11⟩\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\nα = α₁β₁  \nβ = α₁β₂  \nγ = α₂β₁  \nδ = α₂β₂\n\nSo, if we can find such α₁, α₂, β₁, β₂, then the state is separable (not entangled). Otherwise, it's entangled.\n\nAnother method is to use the concept of the determinant. For a two-qubit state, if we arrange the coefficients into a 2x2 matrix:\n\n[ α   β ]\n[ γ   δ ]\n\nThen the state is separable if and only if the determinant of this matrix is zero. The determinant is αδ - βγ. If this is non-zero, the state is entangled.\n\nLet me verify this method. Suppose the state is separable. Then the matrix is the outer product of two vectors, so it has rank 1, hence determinant zero. Conversely, if determinant is zero, then the matrix has rank 1, so it can be written as an outer product of two vectors. Therefore, this method works.\n\nSo, for each state, I can compute the determinant αδ - βγ. If it's non-zero, the state is entangled. If zero, it's separable.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option (a):\n\n(a) (1/√30)*( |00⟩ + 2i|01⟩ - 3|10⟩ - 4i|11⟩ )\n\nSo coefficients are:\n\nα = 1/√30  \nβ = 2i/√30  \nγ = -3/√30  \nδ = -4i/√30\n\nCompute determinant αδ - βγ:\n\n(1/√30)*(-4i/√30) - (2i/√30)*(-3/√30)  \n= (-4i)/30 - (-6i)/30  \n= (-4i + 6i)/30  \n= 2i/30  \n= i/15 ≠ 0\n\nSo determinant is non-zero. Therefore, state (a) is entangled.\n\nOption (b):\n\n(b) (1/5)*( |00⟩ + 2i|01⟩ - 2|10⟩ - 4i|11⟩ )\n\nCoefficients:\n\nα = 1/5  \nβ = 2i/5  \nγ = -2/5  \nδ = -4i/5\n\nCompute determinant:\n\nαδ - βγ = (1/5)(-4i/5) - (2i/5)(-2/5)  \n= (-4i)/25 - (-4i)/25  \n= (-4i + 4i)/25  \n= 0\n\nDeterminant is zero, so state (b) is separable. Therefore, not entangled.\n\nOption (c):\n\n(c) (1/2)( |00⟩ + |01⟩ + |10⟩ - |11⟩ )\n\nCoefficients:\n\nα = 1/2  \nβ = 1/2  \nγ = 1/2  \nδ = -1/2\n\nCompute determinant:\n\nαδ - βγ = (1/2)(-1/2) - (1/2)(1/2)  \n= (-1/4) - (1/4)  \n= -2/4  \n= -1/2 ≠ 0\n\nDeterminant is non-zero, so state (c) is entangled.\n\nOption (d):\n\n(d) (1/2)( |00⟩ + |01⟩ - |10⟩ - |11⟩ )\n\nCoefficients:\n\nα = 1/2  \nβ = 1/2  \nγ = -1/2  \nδ = -1/2\n\nCompute determinant:\n\nαδ - βγ = (1/2)(-1/2) - (1/2)(-1/2)  \n= (-1/4) - (-1/4)  \n= (-1/4 + 1/4)  \n= 0\n\nDeterminant is zero, so state (d) is separable. Therefore, not entangled.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. For option (d), determinant is zero, so it's separable. So the answer would be which of the options are entangled? The entangled ones are (a) and (c). The answer options given are:\n\nA: a,b  \nB: a,c  \nC: b,d  \nD: c,d\n\nSo the correct answer is B: a,c.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations for each determinant.\n\nFor (a):\n\nα = 1/√30, β = 2i/√30, γ = -3/√30, δ = -4i/√30\n\nDeterminant:\n\n(1/√30)(-4i/√30) - (2i/√30)(-3/√30)  \n= (-4i)/30 - (-6i)/30  \n= (-4i +6i)/30 = 2i/30 = i/15. Yes, non-zero. So (a) is entangled.\n\n(b):\n\n(1/5)(-4i/5) - (2i/5)(-2/5)  \n= (-4i/25) - (-4i/25) = 0. Correct. So (b) is separable.\n\n(c):\n\n(1/2)(-1/2) - (1/2)(1/2) = (-1/4) - (1/4) = -1/2. Correct. So (c) is entangled.\n\n(d):\n\n(1/2)(-1/2) - (1/2)(-1/2) = (-1/4) - (-1/4) = 0. Correct. (d) is separable.\n\nTherefore, the entangled states are (a) and (c). So the answer is B: a,c.\n\nBut wait, let me check if maybe there's a mistake in the determinant method. For example, sometimes people might use a different matrix arrangement. Let me confirm.\n\nThe standard way is to arrange the coefficients as a matrix:\n\n[ α   β ]\n[ γ   δ ]\n\nWhich for two-qubit states is correct. For example, if the state is |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩, then arranging the coefficients as above gives the matrix. The determinant being zero is equivalent to the state being separable. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to check if the state can be written as a product. Let me check for (b) and (d), maybe they can be written as product states.\n\nStarting with (b):\n\n(1/5)( |00⟩ + 2i|01⟩ - 2|10⟩ - 4i|11⟩ )\n\nLet me try to write this as (a|0⟩ + b|1⟩) ⊗ (c|0⟩ + d|0⟩). Let me denote the first qubit as a|0⟩ + b|1⟩ and the second as c|0⟩ + d|1⟩.\n\nThen their product is:\n\nac|00⟩ + ad|01⟩ + bc|10⟩ + bd|11⟩\n\nComparing with (b):\n\nac = 1/5  \nad = 2i/5  \nbc = -2/5  \nbd = -4i/5\n\nFrom the first equation, ac = 1/5. From the second, ad = 2i/5. Dividing the second by the first: (ad)/(ac) = (2i/5)/(1/5) = 2i = d/c. Therefore, d = 2i c.\n\nSimilarly, from third equation bc = -2/5. From first equation, ac = 1/5. Dividing third by first: (bc)/(ac) = (-2/5)/(1/5) = -2 = b/a. Therefore, b = -2a.\n\nFrom fourth equation, bd = -4i/5. Let me express b and d in terms of a and c. Since b = -2a and d = 2i c.\n\nSo bd = (-2a)(2i c) = -4i a c. But from the fourth equation, bd = -4i/5. But ac = 1/5. Therefore:\n\n-4i a c = -4i (1/5) = -4i/5, which matches. So all equations are satisfied. Therefore, there exist such a, b, c, d. Therefore, (b) is indeed separable.\n\nSimilarly for (d):\n\n(1/2)( |00⟩ + |01⟩ - |10⟩ - |11⟩ )\n\nLet me try to write as product state. Let me denote (a|0⟩ + b|1⟩) ⊗ (c|0⟩ + d|1⟩).\n\nSo:\n\nac|00⟩ + ad|01⟩ + bc|10⟩ + bd|11⟩ = (1/2)|00⟩ + (1/2)|01⟩ - (1/2)|10⟩ - (1/2)|11⟩\n\nTherefore:\n\nac = 1/2  \nad = 1/2  \nbc = -1/2  \nbd = -1/2\n\nFrom first and second equations: ac = ad ⇒ c = d (assuming a ≠ 0). Similarly, from third and fourth equations: bc = bd ⇒ c = d (assuming b ≠ 0). So c = d.\n\nFrom first equation: ac = 1/2  \nFrom third equation: bc = -1/2  \nTherefore, dividing third by first: (bc)/(ac) = (-1/2)/(1/2) = -1 = b/a ⇒ b = -a.\n\nSo let me set b = -a. Then, from first equation: a c = 1/2. From third equation: (-a)c = -1/2 ⇒ -a c = -1/2 ⇒ a c = 1/2, which matches. So consistent.\n\nNow, from second equation: ad = 1/2. Since d = c, and a c = 1/2, then ad = a c = 1/2, which is correct. Similarly, fourth equation: bd = (-a)c = -a c = -1/2, which matches. Therefore, this is consistent. So such a, b, c, d exist. Therefore, (d) is separable.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion is correct: (a) and (c) are entangled, (b) and (d) are separable. Therefore, the answer is B: a,c.\n\nBut let me check if there is a possibility that maybe (c) is actually separable? Let me try to write (c) as a product state.\n\n(c): (1/2)( |00⟩ + |01⟩ + |10⟩ - |11⟩ )\n\nSo coefficients:\n\nα = 1/2, β = 1/2, γ = 1/2, δ = -1/2\n\nTrying to write as (a|0⟩ + b|1⟩) ⊗ (c|0⟩ + d|1⟩) = ac|00⟩ + ad|01⟩ + bc|10⟩ + bd|11⟩\n\nSo:\n\nac = 1/2  \nad = 1/2  \nbc = 1/2  \nbd = -1/2\n\nFrom first and second equations: ac = ad ⇒ c = d (if a ≠ 0)\n\nFrom third and fourth equations: bc = 1/2 and bd = -1/2. If c = d, then bc = bd ⇒ 1/2 = -1/2, which is impossible. Therefore, no solution. Hence, (c) is entangled. Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, answer is B: a,c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
