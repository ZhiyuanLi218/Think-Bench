The question is asking which of the four options (A to D) are correct statements related to the blackbody spectrum of the CMB. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to determine which of these are correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each option is saying and verify its accuracy.\n\nOption A: Microwaves refer to electromagnetic waves with wavelengths between 10^-3 m and 10 m. I remember that the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is typically between about 1 mm to 1 meter. Wait, 10^-3 meters is 1 mm. So the range from 1 mm (10^-3 m) to 10 meters. But I think microwaves usually go up to around 1 meter, so 10 meters might be a bit on the longer side. Let me check. The microwave spectrum is generally considered to be from about 1 mm (which is 10^-3 m) to 1 meter. So 10^-3 m to 1 m. But option A says up to 10 m. So that's a bit conflicting. Maybe the exact range can vary a bit depending on the source, but 10 meters is actually more in the radio wave region. So perhaps A is incorrect? Or maybe the question is using a different definition. Hmm.\n\nOption B: Microwaves, like sound waves, can only propagate in a medium. Wait, microwaves are electromagnetic waves, which do not require a medium to propagate. Sound waves are mechanical waves and need a medium like air, water, etc. But electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum. So option B is incorrect because microwaves don't need a medium. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: The thermal radiation of a blackbody is actually electromagnetic radiation. Yes, a blackbody is an idealized object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and emits radiation in a continuous spectrum depending on its temperature. So the thermal radiation from a blackbody is indeed electromagnetic. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: Planck proposed the quantum hypothesis in the study of the blackbody's thermal radiation problem. Yes, this is a key point in the history of physics. Max Planck introduced the idea that energy is quantized when he was trying to explain the blackbody radiation spectrum, which led to the development of quantum mechanics. So D is correct.\n\nSo from this analysis, options C and D are correct. But let me double-check the other options again.\n\nBack to Option A: The question is about microwaves. If the definition of microwaves is between 1 mm (10^-3 m) and 1 m, then the upper limit is 1 m, not 10 m. But the option says 10^-3 m to 10 m. So 10 m is 10 meters, which is longer than the typical microwave range. The radio wave region is from about 1 mm to 100 km, so microwaves are a subset of radio waves. But if the question is using a different definition, maybe in some contexts microwaves are considered up to 10 meters. However, according to standard definitions, microwaves are 1 mm to 1 meter. So option A is incorrect. Therefore, A is wrong.\n\nSo the correct options are C and D. Let me check the answer options again. The options are A, B, C, D. The question says \"the following statements related to the blackbody spectrum of cosmic microwave background radiation are correct\". So the correct answers are C and D. But the options are given as A to D. The original question is in Chinese, but the user provided the options and the answer format. The user's instruction is to answer by selecting the correct options from A to D.\n\nSo the correct answer is C and D. Therefore, the answer should be C and D. But I need to check if the options are multiple-choice with multiple correct answers. However, in some cases, the options might be presented as a single selection. Wait, the user hasn't specified whether multiple answers are possible. The original question says \"the following statements related... are correct: Options (A) ... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So in Chinese exams, sometimes multiple options can be correct. For example, in the Chinese Gaokao, sometimes you have multiple correct answers. But the way the question is phrased here, it's possible that more than one option is correct.\n\nGiven that, the correct options are C and D. So the answer would be C and D. However, in the original problem, the options are given as A, B, C, D. The user is asking to \"choose from A to D\", and the correct answer would be C and D. But in some cases, the answer might be presented as a combination. However, the user's instruction is to provide the answer in the format \"Answer: [correct options]\". For example, in Chinese exams, if multiple options are correct, they might be listed as, for example, AC, AD, etc. So here, since C and D are correct, the answer is CD.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Option A: microwaves are 10^-3 m (1 mm) to 10 m. As per standard definitions, microwaves are 1 mm to 1 meter. So 10 meters is too long. So A is incorrect. B is incorrect because microwaves don't need a medium. C is correct. D is correct. Therefore, the answer is C and D. So the correct options are C and D. Therefore, the answer is CD.\n</think>"}
