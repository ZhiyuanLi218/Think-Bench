Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about what happens to the magnetic moment of the particle when the magnetic field direction is suddenly changed from the +Z direction to the +Y direction. The key thing here is that the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment starts oscillating, and we need to find the frequency of these oscillations. The options are given as A to D, each involving gamma (which I know is the gyromagnetic ratio) multiplied by B, sometimes divided by 2 or sqrt(2) or multiplied by sqrt(2). \n\nFirst, let me recall what I know about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic fields. A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment mu which is proportional to its spin angular momentum S. The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. In this problem, it's specified as mu = gamma * Sz, but wait, that seems odd. Because usually, the magnetic moment is a vector, so mu = gamma * S. But here, they say mu = gamma * Sz. Maybe that's a typo or maybe they mean that mu is aligned with the z-component? Hmm. Wait, the problem says the particle is aligned with the magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. So initially, the magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field in the z-direction. So maybe they are using Sz as the z-component of the spin, and mu is gamma times Sz. But in reality, mu is a vector, so maybe they are just considering the z-component here? Maybe the problem is simplifying things. Let me note that.\n\nSo initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That would mean the particle is in the spin-up state along Z. Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the average z-component of the magnetic moment oscillating. So we need to find the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nLet me think about how the spin evolves when the magnetic field is changed. When a magnetic field is applied, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. Since mu = gamma * S, then H = -gamma * S · B. But here, the magnetic field is first in the z-direction, then in the y-direction. \n\nInitially, the particle is in the state with S_z = +ħ/2 (since it's aligned with the magnetic field). Then, when the magnetic field is turned off and turned on along the y-direction, the Hamiltonian suddenly changes. The time evolution of the spin state will then be governed by the new Hamiltonian. \n\nThe key here is to find the time evolution of the expectation value of S_z (or mu_z, which is gamma*S_z) after the magnetic field is switched to the y-direction. \n\nIn quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes suddenly, the state of the system remains the same immediately after the change, but then evolves under the new Hamiltonian. So initially, the state is |+z>, and then it starts evolving under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * S_y. \n\nSo the time evolution operator will be U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ). Let me write that out. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Therefore, the time evolution operator is exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ). \n\nBut since we are dealing with spin-1/2 particles, it's easier to use Pauli matrices. Let me recall that for spin-1/2, S = (ħ/2) sigma, where sigma are the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. Therefore, substituting into H:\n\nH = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. \n\nBut maybe we can work in units where ħ=1 for simplicity? Wait, no, let's keep track of the constants. \n\nBut actually, for the time evolution, the exponent is (-i H t)/ħ. Let me write that:\n\nU(t) = exp[ -i (-gamma B S_y) t / ħ ] = exp[ i gamma B S_y t / ħ ]\n\nBut S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. Therefore:\n\nU(t) = exp[ i gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y t / ħ ] = exp[ i (gamma B / 2) sigma_y t ]\n\nSo the time evolution operator is exp[ i (gamma B / 2) sigma_y t ].\n\nBut let me check the sign. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp[ i gamma B S_y t / ħ ] as above. Yes.\n\nSo the state at time t is |psi(t)> = U(t) |psi(0)>.\n\nInitially, the state is |+z>. So let's write |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. Alternatively, we can compute the expectation value of S_z as a function of time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Heisenberg equation of motion for the spin components. But perhaps it's easier to work in the Schrödinger picture here.\n\nLet me recall that for a spin in a magnetic field, the spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field. So if the magnetic field is in the y-direction, then the spin will precess around the y-axis. Therefore, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate as the spin precesses around the y-axis.\n\nBut initially, the spin is along +z. If the magnetic field is suddenly along y, then the spin will start precessing around the y-axis. The question is, what is the frequency of this precession?\n\nThe Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B. But here, the precession is around the y-axis, so the frequency should be omega = gamma B. But how does this relate to the oscillation of the z-component?\n\nLet me think. If the spin is precessing around the y-axis, then the z-component will oscillate with frequency omega. However, depending on the initial state, maybe there is a factor of 2 or something else?\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of the time evolution. Let me write the initial state |+z> as a spinor. For spin-1/2, |+z> is [1; 0]. The eigenstates of S_y are [1; i]/sqrt(2) and [1; -i]/sqrt(2) for +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.\n\nSo let me express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. Let me denote |+y> = [1; i]/sqrt(2) and |-y> = [1; -i]/sqrt(2). Then, |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me compute that. Let me write |+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>. \n\nSo:\n\n[1; 0] = a [1; i]/sqrt(2) + b [1; -i]/sqrt(2)\n\nSo multiplying through by sqrt(2):\n\n[ sqrt(2); 0 ] = a [1; i] + b [1; -i]\n\nWhich gives equations:\n\nsqrt(2) = a + b \n\n0 = a i - b i \n\nFrom the second equation: 0 = i(a - b) => a = b\n\nSubstituting into first equation: sqrt(2) = 2a => a = sqrt(2)/2 = 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, a = b = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, |+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) |-y>\n\nSo the state is an equal superposition of the +y and -y eigenstates. \n\nNow, when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2), since S_y |+y> = +ħ/2 |+y> and similarly for |-y>.\n\nTherefore, the time evolution will be:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y>\n\nLet me compute E_+ / ħ and E_- / ħ.\n\nE_+ / ħ = -gamma B (ħ/2)/ħ = -gamma B / 2\n\nSimilarly, E_- / ħ = +gamma B / 2\n\nTherefore:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y>\n\nNow, to find the expectation value of S_z, we need to compute <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nFirst, let me recall that S_z for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) diag(1, -1). But let me work with the spinor formalism.\n\nAlternatively, let me express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|+y> = [1; i]/sqrt(2) = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, |-y> = [1; -i]/sqrt(2) = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nLet me verify that. Let me compute (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2):\n\n|+z> is [1; 0], |-z> is [0; 1]. Therefore, adding them:\n\n[1; 0] + i [0; 1] = [1; i], then divided by sqrt(2) gives [1; i]/sqrt(2) which is |+y>. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for |-y>.\n\nTherefore, we can write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSo let me substitute back into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp(i gamma B t / 2) * (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) + (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i gamma B t / 2) * (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nMultiply the constants: 1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2) = 1/2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n|psi(t)> = [exp(i gamma B t / 2) (|+z> + i |-z>) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2) (|+z> - i |-z>)] / 2\n\nLet me distribute the exponents:\n\n= [exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+z> + i exp(i gamma B t / 2) |-z> + exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |+z> - i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-z>] / 2\n\nNow, group the |+z> and |-z> terms:\n\nFor |+z>:\n\n[exp(i gamma B t / 2) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] / 2 |+z> \n\nWhich is cos(gamma B t / 2) |+z>\n\nFor |-z>:\n\n[i exp(i gamma B t / 2) - i exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] / 2 |-z>\n\nFactor out i/2:\n\ni/2 [exp(i gamma B t / 2) - exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] |-z> \n\nWhich is i/2 [ 2i sin(gamma B t / 2) ] |-z> \n\nBecause exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ.\n\nSo this becomes i/2 * 2i sin(...) = i² sin(...) = - sin(...) \n\nTherefore, the |-z> term is - sin(gamma B t / 2) |-z>\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(gamma B t / 2) |+z> - sin(gamma B t / 2) |-z>\n\nTherefore, the state at time t is a superposition of |+z> and |-z> with coefficients cos(gamma B t / 2) and -sin(gamma B t / 2), respectively.\n\nNow, to compute the expectation value of S_z. Since S_z |+z> = +ħ/2 |+z> and S_z |-z> = -ħ/2 |-z>, the expectation value <S_z> is:\n\n<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = |cos(gamma B t / 2)|²*(+ħ/2) + | - sin(gamma B t / 2)|²*(-ħ/2) + cross terms?\n\nWait, no. Wait, more accurately, since |psi(t)> is cos(theta)|+z> - sin(theta)|-z>, where theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nThen, the expectation value is:\n\n[cos(theta) <+z| - sin(theta) <-z| ] S_z [cos(theta)|+z> - sin(theta)|-z> ]\n\nCompute this:\n\nFirst, S_z |+z> = +ħ/2 |+z>, S_z |-z> = -ħ/2 |-z>\n\nSo expanding:\n\ncos(theta) <+z| S_z cos(theta)|+z> - cos(theta) <+z| S_z sin(theta)|-z> - sin(theta) <-z| S_z cos(theta)|+z> + sin(theta) <-z| S_z sin(theta)|-z>\n\nWhich is:\n\ncos²(theta) <+z| S_z |+z> - cos(theta) sin(theta) <+z| S_z |-z> - sin(theta) cos(theta) <-z| S_z |+z> + sin²(theta) <-z| S_z |-z>\n\nNow, note that:\n\n<+z| S_z |+z> = +ħ/2\n\n<-z| S_z |-z> = -ħ/2\n\nCross terms: <+z| S_z |-z> and <-z| S_z |+z> are zero because S_z is diagonal in the z-basis, so off-diagonal terms are zero.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value simplifies to:\n\ncos²(theta)*(ħ/2) + sin²(theta)*(-ħ/2) = [cos²(theta) - sin²(theta)]*(ħ/2) = cos(2 theta)*(ħ/2)\n\nSince cos(2 theta) = cos²(theta) - sin²(theta). \n\nHere, theta = gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta = gamma B t. Therefore:\n\n<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t)\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t). Therefore, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <S_z> = gamma*(ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). Wait, but in the problem statement, they define mu = gamma*S_z. So if mu is gamma times S_z, then the average mu_z is gamma times <S_z>. Therefore, the average mu_z oscillates as gamma*(ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). However, the problem says \"the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating\". The oscillation frequency is the frequency of the cosine term, which is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma*B. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option D is gamma*B. So is the answer D? But let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the magnetic moment is mu = gamma*Sz. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because normally, the magnetic moment is a vector mu = gamma * S. But here, they say mu = gamma * Sz. Maybe that's a typo or maybe they are referring to the z-component? If mu is a vector, then when the magnetic field is in the z-direction, mu_z = gamma*Sz. But when the magnetic field is turned to y-direction, the mu vector will precess around the y-axis. However, in our calculation, we found that <S_z> oscillates with frequency gamma*B. Therefore, if mu_z = gamma*<S_z>, then it oscillates with the same frequency, gamma*B. Hence, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check again my calculation. Because sometimes there can be factors of 2 depending on conventions.\n\nIn our calculation, we found that <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). Therefore, the time dependence is cos(gamma B t), which has angular frequency gamma B. Therefore, the frequency (in Hz) would be gamma B / (2 pi), but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is typically given as angular frequency in these contexts unless specified otherwise. But looking at the options, they are all in terms of gamma*B multiplied by some factors. Since the options don't have pi in them, they must be referring to angular frequency. Hence, the answer is D: gamma*B.\n\nBut let me check if there is a mistake in my calculation. Let me recap:\n\nWe started with the state |+z>, which is an equal superposition of |+y> and |-y>, with coefficients 1/sqrt(2). The energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2). Therefore, the time evolution gives the state as a combination with phases exp(i gamma B t / 2) and exp(-i gamma B t / 2). Then, converting back to |+z> and |-z> basis, we found that <S_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t) times ħ/2. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B. \n\nBut another way to think about it is that when a spin is in a magnetic field, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B. So if the magnetic field is along y, the spin precesses around y with frequency omega = gamma B. The z-component of the spin will then oscillate with that same frequency. Therefore, the answer should be D: gamma*B.\n\nBut let me check if there is a possible factor of 1/2 somewhere. For example, in some conventions, the gyromagnetic ratio is defined with a factor of 2, but in our calculation, we used H = -gamma B S_y. If instead, the Hamiltonian was H = -gamma B S · B, which is correct. For a magnetic moment mu = gamma S in a magnetic field B, the energy is -mu · B = -gamma S · B. Therefore, H = -gamma B S_y when B is along y. So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: the time evolution operator was exp(i (gamma B / 2) sigma_y t). The sigma matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so the energy difference between |+y> and |-y> is 2*(gamma B / 2) = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency between these states is gamma B / ħ * ħ = gamma B. Wait, the energy difference is Delta E = gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ. Then, the transition frequency is Delta E / ħ = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is indeed gamma B. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA: gamma*B/2 \n\nB: gamma*B/sqrt(2) \n\nC: sqrt(2)*gamma*B \n\nD: gamma*B \n\nSo according to my calculation, the answer is D. However, sometimes in these problems, there can be a factor of 1/2 because of the spin precession. Wait, let me think again. When a spin precesses around a magnetic field, the frequency is called the Larmor frequency, which is given by omega = gamma B. So for example, if you have a spin in a magnetic field B, it precesses around B with frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, if the spin is initially along z and the field is along y, then the z-component of the spin will oscillate with frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the answer should be D. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me use the Heisenberg equation of motion for the spin components. \n\nThe Heisenberg equation is dA/dt = (i/ħ)[H, A] + ∂A/∂t. For a time-independent operator A, it's dA/dt = (i/ħ)[H, A].\n\nHere, we can consider the time evolution of S_z under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nTherefore, dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z] = (i/ħ)[ -gamma B S_y, S_z ] \n\nCompute the commutator [S_y, S_z] = iħ S_x. Therefore:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/ħ)( -gamma B )(iħ S_x ) = (i/ħ)( -gamma B iħ S_x ) \n\nMultiply the constants:\n\ni * i = i² = -1, so:\n\n= (-gamma B)(-1) S_x = gamma B S_x \n\nSo dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x \n\nSimilarly, we can write the equation for dS_x/dt. Let me compute that:\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)[ -gamma B S_y, S_x ] \n\n[S_y, S_x] = -iħ S_z \n\nTherefore:\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/ħ)( -gamma B )( -iħ S_z ) \n\nAgain, i * -i = -i² = 1:\n\n= ( -gamma B )( -1 ) S_z = gamma B S_z \n\nTherefore, we have the system of equations:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x \n\ndS_x/dt = gamma B S_z \n\nAnd also, we can compute dS_y/dt, but since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, [H, S_y] = 0, so dS_y/dt = 0. Therefore, S_y is constant. Since initially, the spin is along +z, S_y(0) = 0. Therefore, S_y(t) = 0 for all time.\n\nSo we have:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x \n\ndS_x/dt = gamma B S_z \n\nThis is a system of differential equations. Let me write it as:\n\nd²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B * gamma B S_z = (gamma B)^2 S_z \n\nTherefore, the equation is d²S_z/dt² - (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0 \n\nWait, but that would give solutions like exp(±gamma B t), but that contradicts our previous result of oscillation. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nHold on, let me check the signs again. \n\nFrom above:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x \n\ndS_x/dt = gamma B S_z \n\nTherefore, taking derivative of first equation:\n\nd²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B * gamma B S_z = (gamma B)^2 S_z \n\nTherefore, the differential equation is d²S_z/dt² - (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0 \n\nWhich has solutions S_z(t) = A exp(gamma B t) + B exp(-gamma B t), which is hyperbolic functions, not oscillatory. But that contradicts our previous result where we had oscillations. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, there must be a mistake here. Because according to the Heisenberg equations, we are getting an equation that suggests exponential growth/decay, but our previous calculation using Schrödinger picture gave us oscillations. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check the Heisenberg equation again. \n\nStarting with H = -gamma B S_y. \n\nThe commutator [H, S_z] = [ -gamma B S_y, S_z ] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (iħ S_x )\n\nTherefore, dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z] = (i/ħ)( -gamma B iħ S_x ) = (i/ħ)( -gamma B iħ S_x ) \n\nCalculating constants:\n\ni * i = -1, and ħ / ħ = 1. So:\n\n= (-gamma B)(-1) S_x = gamma B S_x \n\nSo that part is correct. Similarly for dS_x/dt. \n\nBut then, according to this, we have d²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B * gamma B S_z \n\nWhich gives d²S_z/dt² - (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0 \n\nBut this suggests that S_z(t) behaves like cosh or sinh, but our previous result was cos. Where is the error?\n\nAh! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign of the Hamiltonian. Let me check the Heisenberg equation again. \n\nThe Heisenberg equation is dA/dt = (i/ħ)[H, A]. \n\nBut if H = -gamma B S_y, then:\n\n[H, S_z] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (iħ S_x )\n\nTherefore, dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)( -gamma B iħ S_x ) \n\n= (i/ħ)( -gamma B iħ S_x ) \n\n= (i * -i) gamma B S_x \n\nSince i/ħ times -gamma B iħ S_x is:\n\ni * -i * gamma B S_x \n\ni * -i = -i² = -(-1) = 1 \n\nTherefore, dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x \n\nSame as before. \n\nBut then why does the differential equation suggest exponential solutions instead of oscillatory? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the Hamiltonian? Let me recall that the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma S · B. \n\nBut if the magnetic field is along y, then H = -gamma B S_y. \n\nBut let's check the units. Suppose gamma has units of 1/(T·s), since the Larmor frequency omega = gamma B has units of 1/s. \n\nBut maybe there's a missing negative sign somewhere? Let me think about the direction of precession. \n\nIf the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, then the time evolution is generated by this Hamiltonian. Alternatively, sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = omega · S, where omega is related to the magnetic field. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have used H = gamma B S_y instead of negative? Let me check. \n\nThe energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is U = -mu · B. So if mu is in the +z direction and B is in +y direction, then mu · B = 0 initially? Wait, no, initially the magnetic field is in +z, then it's turned to +y. \n\nBut the sign of the Hamiltonian affects the direction of precession. Let me think about the right-hand rule. If the magnetic field is in the +y direction, then the torque on the magnetic moment is tau = mu × B. For a positive gamma, if mu is in +z and B is in +y, then tau is mu × B = (+z) × (+y) = -x direction. The torque causes the spin to precess around the B field direction (y-axis). The precession should follow the right-hand rule: if B is along +y, then the precession is clockwise or counterclockwise when looking along +y?\n\nBut regardless, the equations of motion should give us oscillations. However, according to the differential equation above, we get an exponential solution. That must mean there's a mistake in my derivation.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I forgot that in the Heisenberg equation, the Hamiltonian is H, but the time evolution is generated by H, so if H is -gamma B S_y, maybe the equations of motion are different? Let me try re-deriving the equations of motion carefully.\n\nLet me recall that for spin in a magnetic field, the equations of motion are given by the Bloch equations, which are analogous to classical precession. The quantum mechanical expectation values should obey the same equations as the classical vectors. \n\nClassically, the torque is dS/dt = gamma S × B. \n\nIn our case, B is along +y, so:\n\ndS/dt = gamma S × B = gamma S × (B ŷ) \n\nLet me compute this cross product. \n\nLet me denote B = B ŷ. Then:\n\ndS/dt = gamma B (S × ŷ) \n\nLet me write this out in components. \n\nLet me recall that for any vector A, A × ŷ can be computed. Let me use the cross product identities. \n\nFor example, for the z-component:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B (S_x (ŷ × ŷ)_z + ... wait, no. Wait, dS/dt = gamma B S × ŷ. \n\nLet me write the cross product S × ŷ. \n\nIf ŷ is the unit vector in y-direction, then:\n\nS × ŷ = (S_x î + S_y ĵ + S_z k̂) × ĵ \n\n= S_x î × ĵ + S_y ĵ × ĵ + S_z k̂ × ĵ \n\n= S_x k̂ - S_z î \n\nBecause î × ĵ = k̂, ĵ × ĵ = 0, and k̂ × ĵ = -î. \n\nTherefore:\n\ndS/dt = gamma B (S_x k̂ - S_z î) \n\nWhich gives:\n\ndS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z \n\ndS_y/dt = 0 \n\ndS_z/dt = +gamma B S_x \n\nWait, this contradicts our previous Heisenberg equation result. Earlier, we had dS_z/dt = +gamma B S_x and dS_x/dt = +gamma B S_z. But according to the classical equation here, dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z. There is a discrepancy in the sign of dS_x/dt. \n\nWhere is this coming from? \n\nIn our quantum mechanical Heisenberg equation, we had:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x \n\ndS_x/dt = gamma B S_z \n\nBut according to the classical equation, dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z. There is a sign difference. \n\nThis suggests that there is an error in our quantum mechanical derivation. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from the Heisenberg equation for dS_x/dt:\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] \n\nH = -gamma B S_y \n\n[H, S_x] = -gamma B [S_y, S_x] = -gamma B (-iħ S_z) = +i gamma B ħ S_z \n\nTherefore:\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/ħ)(i gamma B ħ S_z ) = (i^2 gamma B S_z ) = -gamma B S_z \n\nAh! There was a mistake in my previous calculation. Earlier, I said dS_x/dt = gamma B S_z, but actually it is -gamma B S_z. I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me redo that part.\n\nPreviously, I thought [S_y, S_x] = -iħ S_z, which is correct. Then [H, S_x] = -gamma B [S_y, S_x] = -gamma B (-iħ S_z) = +i gamma B ħ S_z. Then, dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)(i gamma B ħ S_z) = i^2 gamma B S_z = -gamma B S_z. Yes, so the correct equation is dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z. \n\nEarlier, I had mistakenly said dS_x/dt = gamma B S_z, which was incorrect. That was the error. So the correct system of equations is:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x \n\ndS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z \n\nNow, taking derivative of dS_z/dt:\n\nd²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (-gamma B S_z) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z \n\nTherefore, the differential equation is d²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0 \n\nWhich has solutions S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t). Given the initial conditions, this matches our previous result from the Schrödinger picture calculation. \n\nSo earlier mistake was in the sign of the commutator when calculating dS_x/dt. Fixing that, we now have the correct differential equation leading to oscillatory solutions with frequency gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is indeed gamma B, which corresponds to option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: gamma*B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
