Finally, we are to compute $ a + b $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand Terminating Decimals\n\nA rational number $ \\frac{1}{n} $ has a **terminating decimal expansion** if and only if the **prime factorization of $ n $** contains **only** the primes 2 and 5. In other words, after reducing the fraction to lowest terms, the denominator must be of the form $ 2^a \\cdot 5^b $.\n\nBut in this problem, we are only considering **odd** integers.

Then express that probability as a reduced fraction a/b and find a + b. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a terminating decimal is. From what I remember, a fraction will have a terminating decimal expansion if and only if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. So, for example, 1/8 is 0.125, which terminates because 8 is 2^3. Similarly, 1/5 is 0.2, which terminates. But 1/3 is 0.333..., which doesn't terminate because 3 is a prime other than 2 or 5.\n\nBut in this problem, we're dealing with reciprocals of positive odd integers less than 2010. So, the reciprocal would be 1/n where n is an odd integer less than 2010. The question is asking for the probability that 1/n is a terminating decimal. \n\nWait, but if n is already an odd integer, then when we write 1/n as a fraction, the denominator is n (since it's 1 over n). So, for 1/n to be a terminating decimal, n must only have prime factors of 2 and 5. However, since n is odd, it cannot have 2 as a prime factor. Therefore, n must be a power of 5. Because if n has any prime factor other than 5, then 1/n won't terminate. \n\nSo, restating that: For 1/n to be a terminating decimal, n must be of the form 5^k where k is a non-negative integer. But since n is a positive odd integer less than 2010, we need to find all such numbers n which are powers of 5 and less than 2010.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to two parts:\n\n1. Find the total number of positive odd integers less than 2010.\n2. Find how many numbers of the form 5^k are less than 2010.\n3. The probability is then the second number divided by the first number. Then reduce the fraction and add the numerator and denominator.\n\nOkay, let's start with the first part: total number of positive odd integers less than 2010.\n\nPositive integers less than 2010 are 1, 2, 3, ..., 2009. So total numbers is 2009. Since we want only odd integers, how many are there?\n\nWell, in any range from 1 to N, the number of odd integers is ceiling(N/2). But since 2010 is even, numbers less than 2010 go up to 2009, which is odd. So from 1 to 2009 inclusive, the number of odd integers is (2009 + 1)/2 = 2010/2 = 1005. Wait, let me check that.\n\nIf N is odd, the number of odd numbers from 1 to N is (N + 1)/2? Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose N is odd. Let's take N = 5. Numbers are 1,2,3,4,5. Number of odds: 3. Which is (5 + 1)/2 = 3. So yes, that formula works. So if N is odd, number of odds is (N + 1)/2. If N is even, it's N/2. In our case, the upper limit is 2009, which is odd, so number of odd numbers is (2009 + 1)/2 = 2010/2 = 1005. So total number of possible denominators is 1005.\n\nOkay, so that's the denominator of our probability. Now the numerator is the number of odd integers less than 2010 which are powers of 5.\n\nSo we need to find all integers k ≥ 0 such that 5^k is odd and less than 2010. But since 5 is odd, any power of 5 is also odd, so all 5^k are odd. Therefore, we need to find the number of integers k ≥ 0 for which 5^k < 2010.\n\nSo let's compute the values of 5^k until we exceed 2010.\n\nStart with k=0: 5^0 = 1. 1 < 2010, yes.\n\nk=1: 5^1 = 5 < 2010\n\nk=2: 25 < 2010\n\nk=3: 125 < 2010\n\nk=4: 625 < 2010\n\nk=5: 3125. Wait, 5^5 is 3125. Is 3125 less than 2010? No, 3125 is greater than 2010. Therefore, the exponents k can be 0,1,2,3,4. Therefore, there are 5 such numbers: 1, 5, 25, 125, 625.\n\nWait, let me check 5^4: 5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125. Yes. So 5^4 is 625 < 2010, and 5^5 is 3125 > 2010. Therefore, the exponents k can be from 0 to 4 inclusive. So that's 5 numbers. Therefore, there are 5 numbers which are powers of 5 less than 2010.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"positive odd integers less than 2010\". So n must be a positive integer, so n ≥ 1. 5^0 is 1, which is allowed. So yes, 1 is included. Therefore, there are 5 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5 / 1005. Then we need to reduce this fraction.\n\nLet me compute GCD(5, 1005). Well, 1005 divided by 5 is 201, so 5 divides 1005 exactly. Therefore, GCD(5, 1005) is 5. Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 5: 5/1005 = 1/201. Therefore, the probability is 1/201, so a is 1, b is 201. Therefore, a + b is 1 + 201 = 202.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check my reasoning again. Because maybe there are more numbers which are not just powers of 5, but products of 5 and 2? But no, because n must be odd. So n can't have factors of 2. Therefore, n must be of the form 5^k, since the denominator can only have factors 2 and 5 for the decimal to terminate, but since n is odd, it can't have factors of 2, so only factors of 5. Therefore, only powers of 5. Therefore, the numerator is 5 numbers. Therefore, probability is 5/1005 = 1/201. So answer is 202. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me check if there are other numbers which are not powers of 5 but still only have 5 as their prime factor. Well, no. If a number only has 5 as prime factor, then it must be a power of 5. Because if you have multiple primes, even if it's 5 and something else, but since n is odd, it can't have 2, but if it has another odd prime, like 5 and 3, then it would have another prime factor, so 1/n would not terminate. Therefore, only numbers that are powers of 5. Therefore, only 5 numbers. Therefore, the probability is 5 / total number of odd numbers less than 2010, which is 1005. Then 5/1005 reduces to 1/201. Therefore, a + b is 202. \n\nBut let me check if there's something wrong here. Let me check if maybe numbers like 1, which is 5^0, is considered here. Yes, 1 is an odd integer less than 2010. And 1/1 is 1.0, which is a terminating decimal. So yes, that counts. Similarly, 1/5 is 0.2, terminating. 1/25 is 0.04, terminating. 1/125 is 0.008, terminating. 1/625 is 0.0016, terminating. 1/3125 is 0.00032, but 3125 is over 2010, so not counted. So yes, only 5 numbers. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are numbers which are multiples of 5 but also have other factors. For example, 15 is odd, less than 2010. 1/15 is 0.0666..., which is non-terminating. Similarly, 25 is okay because it's 5 squared. 75 is 5^2 * 3, which would not be allowed. Therefore, only numbers with 5 as the only prime factor. Therefore, only powers of 5. Therefore, 5 numbers. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 5 / 1005. Simplify that. 5 divides into 1005 201 times. So 1 / 201. Therefore, a + b is 1 + 201 = 202. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check the total number of odd integers less than 2010 again. The problem says \"positive odd integers less than 2010\". So numbers from 1 to 2009 inclusive, odd. How many numbers is that?\n\nThe formula is ((last - first)/difference) + 1. So first term 1, last term 2009, difference 2. So ((2009 - 1)/2) + 1 = (2008 / 2) + 1 = 1004 + 1 = 1005. So that's correct. So total of 1005 numbers. Therefore, 5 / 1005 reduces to 1 / 201. Therefore, answer is 202. \n\nBut let me check once more if there are more numbers which are allowed. For example, numbers like 5^k * 2^m, but since n has to be odd, m must be zero. Therefore, only 5^k. Therefore, only the five numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about reciprocal, so maybe 1/n is terminating. So n must be of the form 2^a * 5^b. However, since n is odd, a must be zero, so n must be 5^b. Therefore, same conclusion. Therefore, only powers of 5. \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct. So answer is 202. \n\nBut let me check if maybe there are other numbers with denominator having only 5s and 2s, but since n is odd, only 5s. So yes. Therefore, only powers of 5. Therefore, 5 numbers. Therefore, probability is 5/1005 = 1/201. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check 5^4 = 625. 5^5 = 3125, which is more than 2010. Therefore, exponents from 0 to 4, which is 5 numbers. So 1, 5, 25, 125, 625. Yes. \n\nTherefore, I think that is correct. Therefore, the answer is 202. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{202}\n</think>"}
