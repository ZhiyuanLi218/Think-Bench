Let me start by recalling what I know about simple harmonic motion and friction. \n\nThe setup is a spring with spring constant k, attached to a block of mass m. Then the student places another small block of mass m on top of the original block. So the total mass becomes m + m? Wait, the problem says the original block has mass m, and the small block is also mass m? Or is the small block of mass m placed on the original block of mass M? Wait, let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a simple spring-block oscillator of spring constant k and amplitude A. The block attached to the spring has a mass of m. If the student places a small block of mass m on top of the original block...\" So both blocks have mass m? So total mass is 2m? Or is the small block's mass different? Wait, the problem says \"a small block of mass m on top of the original block\". So original block is mass m, small block is also mass m? So total mass is 2m. \n\nBut maybe the original block is mass M, and the small block is mass m? Wait, the problem says \"the block attached to the spring has a mass of m\". Then the small block is also mass m. So total mass is m + m = 2m. \n\nBut let me check the answer choices. For example, answer A says coefficient of static friction must be greater than kA/[(M + m)g]. Wait, but the original block is mass m. Maybe there was a typo? Wait, the problem says the original block has mass m, and the small block is mass m. So total mass is 2m. But in answer A, they refer to (M + m). Maybe M is the original block's mass? Wait, maybe I need to check again. \n\nWait the problem says: \"the block attached to the spring has a mass of m. If the student places a small block of mass m on top of the original block...\" So original block is m, small block is also m. So total mass is 2m. So in the answer choices, if they have (M + m), maybe M was supposed to be the original block's mass, but in the problem it's m. So maybe the answer choices have a typo? Wait, but the answer choices are given as they are. Let me just proceed. \n\nThe question is about when the small block is most likely to slide off, and what the coefficient of static friction needs to be. \n\nFirst, when does the small block tend to slide off? In a spring-block system, the blocks are undergoing simple harmonic motion. The maximum acceleration occurs at the maximum displacement from equilibrium. Because in SHM, acceleration is a = -ω²x. So maximum acceleration is at maximum x, which is the amplitude. \n\nSo when the system is at maximum displacement, the acceleration is maximum. Therefore, the force required to keep the small block moving with the original block is maximum at that point. If the required force exceeds the maximum static friction, then the small block will slide off. Therefore, the small block is most likely to slide off when the acceleration is maximum, which is at maximum displacement. So this would suggest that the answer is either A or C, which state that the small block is most likely to slide off at maximum displacement. \n\nNow, let's figure out the condition for the coefficient of static friction. The maximum static friction force is μs * N, where N is the normal force. Since the small block is on top of the original block, the normal force N is equal to its weight, which is m * g. Wait, but if the original block is mass m and the small block is also mass m, then the total mass is 2m. However, the normal force on the small block is just m * g, because the small block's weight is m * g, and assuming no vertical acceleration, N = m * g. \n\nThe maximum static friction is μs * m * g. This must be greater than or equal to the maximum force required to accelerate the small block. The maximum force required is m * a_max, where a_max is the maximum acceleration of the system. \n\nWhat is a_max? For a spring system, angular frequency ω is sqrt(k / total mass). The total mass is now 2m. So ω = sqrt(k / (2m)). The maximum acceleration is ω² * A. Let's compute that: \n\na_max = ω² * A = (k / (2m)) * A = kA / (2m). \n\nBut wait, the force required to accelerate the small block is m * a_max. So:\n\nF_required = m * (kA / 2m) = kA / 2. \n\nBut this must be less than or equal to μs * m * g. \n\nTherefore:\n\nμs * m * g ≥ kA / 2 \n\n=> μs ≥ (kA) / (2 m g) \n\nBut wait, in the answer choices, they have expressions like kA / [(M + m)g]. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal mass was m, added mass is m, so total mass is 2m. But when considering the maximum acceleration, the total mass affects the angular frequency. \n\nBut the force needed to accelerate the small block is only dependent on its own mass and the acceleration. The acceleration of the entire system depends on the total mass. \n\nSo let me re-derive this properly. \n\nThe system's angular frequency is ω = sqrt(k / M_total), where M_total is original block plus small block. If original block is mass m, and added block is mass m, then M_total = 2m. \n\nThe maximum acceleration of the system is a_max = ω² * A = (k / M_total) * A = (kA) / M_total. \n\nTherefore, the maximum force needed on the small block is F = m * a_max = m * (kA / M_total). \n\nThis force must be provided by static friction. The maximum static friction is μs * m * g. \n\nSo setting μs * m * g ≥ m * (kA / M_total) \n\nCancel m:\n\nμs * g ≥ kA / M_total \n\n=> μs ≥ kA / (M_total * g) \n\nSince M_total is original mass plus small mass. If original mass is M and small mass is m, then M_total = M + m. But in our problem, original mass is m and small mass is m, so M_total = m + m = 2m. \n\nTherefore, μs ≥ kA / (2m * g). \n\nBut in the answer choices, they have expressions with (M + m). For example, answer A says μs > kA / [(M + m)g]. If in our case, original mass is m, and added mass is m, then M_total = m + m, so if we replace M with m (original mass) and m with the added mass, but the problem says the small block is mass m. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. \n\nWait, perhaps the original block is mass M, and the small block is mass m. The problem says \"the block attached to the spring has a mass of m\". Wait, no, the problem says: \"The block attached to the spring has a mass of m. If the student places a small block of mass m on top of the original block...\" So original block is mass m, small block is mass m. So total mass is 2m. Therefore, in the answer choices, if they have (M + m), perhaps they meant M as original block and m as the small block. But in our case, both are m. Therefore, perhaps the answer choices are using M for original block and m for the small block? Let me check the answer choices again. \n\nLooking at answer A: coefficient of static friction must be greater than kA / [(M + m)g]. If original block is mass M and the small block is mass m, then total mass is M + m, and the condition would be μs ≥ kA / [(M + m)g]. But in our problem, original block is mass m and the small block is also mass m, so M would be m and m is m. So substituting, μs ≥ kA / [(m + m)g] = kA / (2m g), which matches our earlier result. \n\nBut the problem didn't use M and m for original block and small block. It used m for original block and m for small block. So perhaps the answer choices have a typo? Or maybe the original block is mass M, and the problem statement had a typo? Wait, the problem says: \"the block attached to the spring has a mass of m\". So maybe the answer choices are using M as original block and m as small block? But the problem didn't say that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the small block is mass m, and the original block is mass M. Let me think. If that's the case, then the total mass is M + m. Then the maximum acceleration is kA / (M + m). The force required to accelerate the small block is m * a_max = m * kA / (M + m). This must be less than μs * m * g. Therefore, μs ≥ [m / (M + m)] * kA / (m g) ) → μs ≥ kA / [(M + m) g]. Which is exactly what answer A and B have. \n\nBut in our problem, the original block is mass m, and the small block is also mass m. So if we take M = m (original block) and m (small block), then μs ≥ kA / [(m + m)g] = kA / (2m g). Which is equivalent to answer A if M is original block mass (m) and m is the small block mass (m). But answer A says \"coefficient of static friction... greater than kA / [(M + m)g]\". Which in our case would be kA / [(m + m)g] = kA/(2m g). So that would be correct. \n\nBut then answer A says \"the small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction... greater than kA/[(M + m)g]\". So if that's the case, answer A would be correct. However, answer B has the same coefficient condition but says the block is most likely to slide off at equilibrium position. \n\nBut earlier reasoning suggests that maximum acceleration is at maximum displacement, so maximum force needed is there. Therefore, the small block is most likely to slide off at maximum displacement. Therefore, answer A or C. \n\nLooking at answer A and B, they have the condition μs > kA / [(M + m)g], whereas C and D have μs > (M + m)g / (kA). Which is inverse. \n\nOur derivation shows that μs needs to be greater than kA / [(M + m)g]. So answers A and B are correct in that aspect. \n\nTherefore, answer A or B. \n\nNow, between A and B, which one is correct? \n\nThe question is whether the small block is most likely to slide off at maximum displacement or at equilibrium. \n\nAs I thought earlier, maximum acceleration occurs at maximum displacement. The maximum force required to keep the small block moving with the original block is at maximum acceleration. Therefore, the small block is most likely to slide off at maximum displacement. Therefore, answer A or C. Wait no, A and B differ in where the sliding occurs. \n\nWait, I said earlier that A and B differ in the sliding location: A says maximum displacement, B says equilibrium. And A and B have the same coefficient condition. C and D have inverse coefficient condition. \n\nSince our reasoning says sliding is most likely at maximum displacement, answer A or C. Wait, no. Wait answer A is \"most likely to slide off at maximum displacement... coefficient greater than kA/[(M + m)g]\" which matches our condition. Answer C says \"most likely to slide off at maximum displacement... coefficient greater than (M + m)g/(kA)\". Which is inverse. So answer A is correct. \n\nBut let me check again. \n\nLet me re-derive. \n\nMaximum static friction force is μs * N = μs * m * g (assuming small block mass is m). \n\nThe required force to accelerate the small block is m * a_max. \n\na_max for the system is (k / (M_total)) * A. Where M_total is original block plus small block. If original block is mass M and small block is mass m, then M_total = M + m. Therefore, a_max = (kA)/(M + m). \n\nTherefore, required force is m * (kA)/(M + m). \n\nSet this less than or equal to μs * m * g. \n\nCancel m: \n\nkA/(M + m) ≤ μs * g \n\n=> μs ≥ kA / [ (M + m) g ] \n\nWhich is the condition given in answers A and B. \n\nTherefore, if the answer is A, which says that the small block is most likely to slide off at maximum displacement and μs > kA / [(M + m)g], then A is correct. But answer B says it's most likely to slide off at equilibrium. \n\nBut why would it slide off at equilibrium? At equilibrium position, the acceleration is zero. Therefore, the force needed to keep the small block moving is zero. Therefore, no sliding due to acceleration. However, at equilibrium, the speed is maximum. Could there be sliding due to something else? For example, if the velocity is too high, but static friction doesn't oppose velocity, it opposes the required acceleration. Since at equilibrium, the acceleration is zero, so no force is needed. Therefore, the small block is most likely to slide off at maximum acceleration, which is at maximum displacement. Therefore, answer A is correct. \n\nBut let me check answer options again. The original problem says the original block has mass m, and the small block is mass m. So in answer A, they have (M + m). If original block is mass m and small block is mass m, then M would be original block's mass, m is small block's mass. Then M + m = m + m = 2m. So answer A's condition is μs > kA / [ (M + m) g ] = kA / (2m g). Which is correct. \n\nBut in the problem statement, there is no M mentioned. The original block is mass m. So maybe in the answer choices, they used M for original block and m for the small block, but in the problem statement, both are m. Therefore, if we take M as original block's mass (which is m) and m as small block's mass (which is m), then answer A is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nBut wait, let me check answer B. Answer B says the same coefficient condition but sliding at equilibrium. Since sliding is more likely at maximum acceleration, which is at maximum displacement, answer A is correct. \n\nBut let me think again. Is there a possibility that when the system passes through equilibrium, the velocity is maximum, and maybe if the amplitude is too large, the block could be thrown off? But no, because static friction doesn't depend on velocity. Static friction can provide whatever force is needed up to its maximum value to prevent sliding, regardless of velocity. The only thing that matters is the acceleration, because the required force is m*a. Therefore, as long as the maximum required force (at maximum acceleration) is less than μs*N, then the block won't slide anywhere. Therefore, the critical point is at maximum acceleration, i.e., maximum displacement. Hence answer A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nBut let me check the answer options again. The options are:\n\nA: ...greater than kA/[(M+m)g]\n\nB: ...greater than kA/[(M+m)g]\n\nC: ...greater than (M+m)g/(kA)\n\nD: ...greater than (M+m)g/(kA)\n\nSo A and B have the same condition but different locations. C and D have inverse. \n\nSince we concluded the location is maximum displacement, answer A or C? No, A and B have the same condition. A says maximum displacement, B says equilibrium. \n\nEarlier reasoning says A is correct. \n\nBut let me check if there is a miscalculation. \n\nSuppose original block is mass M, small block is mass m. Total mass is M + m. \n\nMaximum acceleration is a_max = ω² A, where ω = sqrt(k/(M + m)). Therefore, a_max = k/(M + m) * A. \n\nThe force on the small block is m * a_max = m k A / (M + m). \n\nThis must be less than μs m g. Therefore, μs > [m / (M + m)] * k A / (m g) ) = k A / [ (M + m) g ] \n\nYes, so that's correct. Therefore, the condition is μs > kA / [ (M + m) g ]. \n\nTherefore, answers A and B have this condition. \n\nSince the maximum force is needed at maximum acceleration, which occurs at maximum displacement, answer A is correct. \n\nBut why does answer B exist? Maybe if someone thought that maximum velocity is at equilibrium, and thought that maybe the block could be thrown off due to high speed? But static friction does not depend on speed. So even if speed is high, as long as the acceleration is within the static friction limit, the block won't slide. Therefore, answer A is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nBut let me check the answer options again. The problem statement says the original block is mass m, and the small block is mass m. So if in answer A, they have (M + m), then M would be original block's mass (m) and m is the small block's mass (m). Therefore, answer A is correct. \n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the original block is mass m, and the small block is also mass m. So total mass is 2m. Therefore, if we substitute M = m and m = m, then answer A's condition becomes μs > kA / [ (m + m)g ] = kA / (2 m g). Which is correct. \n\nTherefore, answer A is correct. \n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. For example, considering the maximum acceleration. \n\nThe maximum acceleration of the system is a_max = kA / (M_total). If the small block is to stay on, the maximum acceleration cannot exceed μs * g. Wait, because the maximum acceleration that can be provided by static friction is μs * g. Wait, how?\n\nBecause for the small block, the maximum acceleration it can have without sliding is when the required force is m*a = μs*m*g => a = μs*g. Therefore, the maximum acceleration of the system must be less than or equal to μs * g. \n\nBut earlier we had a_max = kA / (M_total). Therefore:\n\nkA / (M_total) ≤ μs * g \n\n=> μs ≥ kA / (M_total * g) \n\nWhich is the same as before. Since M_total is M + m (original block plus small block). \n\nTherefore, μs ≥ kA / [ (M + m) g ] \n\nWhich again gives answer A or B. Since maximum acceleration occurs at maximum displacement, answer A is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in associating the maximum acceleration with maximum displacement. In SHM, acceleration is given by a = -ω² x. So maximum acceleration occurs at maximum x, which is the amplitude. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, at maximum displacement. \n\nTherefore, answer A is correct. \n\nBut let me check if the answer is B. Suppose someone thinks that when the block passes through equilibrium, the restoring force is maximum? No, the restoring force is maximum at maximum displacement. At equilibrium, the restoring force is zero. \n\nTherefore, answer A is correct. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is A. However, looking back at the answer options, answer A says \"the small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/[(M+m)g].\" \n\nYes, that matches our analysis. Therefore, answer A. \n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the original block is mass m, and the small block is mass m. Therefore, M_total = m + m = 2m. If the answer choice A has (M + m), then M is original block mass (m), and m is small block mass (m), so (M + m) = 2m. Therefore, the condition is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nBut let me check the other options just to be thorough. \n\nOption C says the same location (maximum displacement) but the condition is μs > (M + m)g / (kA). Which is the inverse of the correct condition. So if μs needs to be greater than kA / [(M + m)g], then answer C is incorrect. \n\nSimilarly, D says sliding at equilibrium with same inverse condition. \n\nTherefore, answer A is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
