So, we have two stars with the same mass as the Sun, each hosting a Neptune-mass planet in circular orbits. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods based on the radial velocity (RV) method observations. The given data is the wavelength shifts of a spectral line: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #2. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the radial velocity method works. The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The star wobbles around the center of mass of the system, and this motion causes periodic redshifts and blueshifts in the star's spectral lines. The amplitude of these shifts is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters.\n\nThe key formula here is the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K), which is given by:\n\nK = (2π G / (P * (M_star^(1/3)))^(1/2)) * (M_planet * sin(i)) / (M_star^(1/3))\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the exact formula for K. Alternatively, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) / P^(1/3) * sin(i), where P is the orbital period, and i is the inclination angle. But since the planets are not specified to have the same inclination, but the problem states that the same spectral line is used for both, perhaps assuming edge-on orbits (i=90°) so sin(i)=1? Or maybe the problem assumes that the inclination is the same for both planets, so it cancels out in the ratio.\n\nBut the problem says \"the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 milliangstrom\". So the observed Doppler shift is directly related to the star's velocity amplitude K. So the ratio of the K values (K2/K1) is 7/5.\n\nGiven that both stars have the same mass (M_star), and both planets have the same mass (M_planet), the only variables here are the orbital period P and the inclination angle i. But since the problem states that the planets are in circular orbits, but doesn't mention inclination. However, since we are comparing the same type of observation (same spectral line, same setup), perhaps we can assume that the inclination is the same for both, or that sin(i) is the same. If that's the case, then the K values are proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) / P^(1/3). Since M_planet and M_star are the same for both, the ratio of K2/K1 would be (P1/P2)^(1/3). Wait, let me check that.\n\nLet me write the formula again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/2) * (M_planet sin i / M_star) / (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * (a / (1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/2)\n\nBut for circular orbits, e=0, so (1 - e^2)^(1/2) = 1. Also, the semi-major axis a can be related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Let's recall that for a planet orbiting a star, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by:\n\nP^2 = (4π² a³) / (G (M_star + M_planet))\n\nSince the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So:\n\na³ ≈ (G M_star P²) / (4π²)\n\nBut the semi-amplitude K is also related to the star's velocity. The star's velocity is v = 2π a_star / P, where a_star is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass. Since a_star = (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) * a ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * a.\n\nSo substituting a from Kepler's law:\n\na ≈ (G M_star P²)^(1/3) / (4π²)^(1/3)\n\nThen a_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * a ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * [ (G M_star P²)^(1/3) / (4π²)^(1/3) ) ]\n\nThen the star's velocity v = 2π a_star / P ≈ 2π / P * [ (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star P²)^(1/3) / (4π²)^(1/3) ) ]\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nLet me write it step by step:\n\nv = 2π * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star P²)^(1/3) / [ (4π²)^(1/3) * P ]\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n(2π) / (4π²)^(1/3) = 2π / ( (4)^(1/3) * π^(2/3) )) = 2 / 4^(1/3) * π^(1 - 2/3) = 2 / 4^(1/3) * π^(1/3)\n\nBut maybe it's easier to combine exponents:\n\nLet me write the entire expression:\n\nv = [ (2π) / (4π²)^(1/3) ) ] * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3 - 1) )\n\nWait, let's handle the exponents for P. The term (P²)^(1/3) is P^(2/3), divided by P gives P^(2/3 - 1) = P^(-1/3). So overall:\n\nv ∝ (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3)\n\nBut since G, M_star, and M_planet are constants for both planets (same star mass and planet mass), the velocity v (which is the K value here, assuming sin i = 1) is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n\nTherefore, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nSo the ratio K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nGiven that K2 is 7 and K1 is 5, then:\n\n7/5 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nWe need to find P2 / P1.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n(P1 / P2)^(1/3) = 7/5\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\nP1 / P2 = (7/5)^3\n\nTherefore, P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.367\n\nWait, but the question asks \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1\", so P2 / P1. If P2 / P1 ≈ 0.367, then that would mean P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.367, but the options include 0.36 as option D. However, let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, the formula: K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, that would mean that P2 is smaller than P1. Because if K is larger, the denominator P^(1/3) is smaller, so P is smaller. Therefore, if K2/K1 = 7/5, then P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 ≈ P1 * 0.367. So P2 is 0.367 times P1, meaning the period of planet 2 is shorter. But the question asks how many times longer is the period of planet 2. Since it's shorter, the answer would be 0.36 times, which is option D. But let me check the options again: D is ~0.36. But let me verify the formula again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the proportionality. Let's start again.\n\nFrom the formula K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Therefore, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Wait, no, let me write:\n\nIf K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Therefore, rearranged:\n\n(P2 / P1)^(1/3) = K1 / K2\n\nSo P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3\n\nGiven K1 = 5, K2 = 7, then P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.367, which is approximately 0.36. Therefore, the answer is D: ~0.36.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA: ~1.40\n\nB: ~1.96\n\nC: ~0.85\n\nD: ~0.36\n\nSo the answer would be D. But let me check if I got the ratio right.\n\nWait, the question is \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So P2 / P1. If P2 is shorter, then the answer is less than 1. So D is the correct answer here.\n\nBut let me make sure about the proportionality. Let's derive it properly.\n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/2) * (M_planet sin i / M_star^(2/3)) / sqrt(1 - e^2)\n\nBut for circular orbits, e=0. Also, using Kepler's third law:\n\nP^2 = (4π² a³) / (G M_star)\n\nSo a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4π²)\n\nAlso, the velocity of the star is v = 2π a_star / P, where a_star is the star's semi-major axis. Since a_star = a * (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) ≈ a * (M_planet / M_star)\n\nSo substituting a from above:\n\na = [ (G M_star P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)\n\nThen a_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * [ (G M_star P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)\n\nThen the star's velocity v = 2π a_star / P = 2π / P * (M_planet / M_star) * [ (G M_star P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)\n\nLet me compute the constants:\n\nLet me write:\n\nv = 2π / P * (M_planet / M_star) * [ (G M_star P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(G M_star P²) / (4π²) under cube root is [G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4π²)^(1/3)]\n\nSo substituting back:\n\nv = 2π / P * (M_planet / M_star) * G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4π²)^(1/3)\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe P terms: 1/P * P^(2/3) = P^(-1 + 2/3) = P^(-1/3)\n\nThe M_star terms: M_planet / M_star * M_star^(1/3) = M_planet * M_star^(-2/3)\n\nThe constants: 2π / (4π²)^(1/3) * G^(1/3)\n\nSo overall:\n\nv = [2π / (4π²)^(1/3)] * G^(1/3) * M_planet * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)\n\nTherefore, v ∝ M_planet / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))\n\nSince M_planet and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio of v2 / v1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nGiven that v is proportional to K (the radial velocity amplitude), so K2 / K1 = v2 / v1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\n(P1 / P2)^(1/3) = K2 / K1\n\nWait, no:\n\nIf K2 / K1 = v2 / v1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3), then:\n\n(P1 / P2) = (K2 / K1)^3\n\nSo P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3\n\nGiven K1 = 5, K2 = 7, so P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.367, which is approximately 0.36. So the answer is D: ~0.36.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Suppose K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3). Therefore, K2 / K1 = P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Therefore, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3 → P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo since K2 is larger than K1 (7 vs 5), P2 is smaller than P1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1 by a factor of (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.367, which is option D. So the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
