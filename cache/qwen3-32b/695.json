The atom starts in the ¹S₀ state, decays to ¹P₁ emitting γ₁, then from ¹P₁ to ¹S₀ emitting γ₂. The angle between the two photons is θ. The given rotation matrix is d₁^{m' m} for angular momentum representations. \n\nFirst, let me recall that for electric dipole transitions, the emitted photon carries away angular momentum. The initial state is ¹S₀, which has L=0 and S=0, so total angular momentum J=0. Then it goes to ¹P₁, which is L=1, S=0, so J=1. Then back to ¹S₀. \n\nSo the first transition is from J=0 to J=1. Since the initial state has J=0, the only possible m value is 0. But when it decays to J=1, the angular momentum must be carried away by the photon. Photons have spin 1, so the emitted photon must have angular momentum such that the total angular momentum is conserved. \n\nWait, the initial state is J=0, so the total angular momentum must be conserved. Therefore, the final state (¹P₁) must have J=1, and the photon must carry away angular momentum to balance that. Since the photon is emitted, its angular momentum should be such that the total angular momentum is conserved. \n\nBut how does this relate to the polarization of the photon? For dipole transitions, the polarization of the photon is related to the change in angular momentum. For circular polarization, the photon has helicity ±1 (left or right circular polarization). \n\nIn the first transition from ¹S₀ (J=0) to ¹P₁ (J=1), the photon must carry away angular momentum of 1. Since the initial state is J=0, the final state (¹P₁) must have J=1, so the photon must have angular momentum such that 0 = 1 + photon's angular momentum? Wait, angular momentum conservation would be initial J_initial = J_final + photon's angular momentum. \n\nWait, actually, the total angular momentum should be conserved. So the initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state after emission is the atom in J=1 plus the photon with angular momentum. So the total angular momentum should still be 0. Therefore, the photon's angular momentum must be opposite to the atom's angular momentum. \n\nBut the photon's angular momentum is along its direction of propagation. So if the atom is in a state with angular momentum m, then the photon must have angular momentum -m? Wait, maybe. \n\nBut for circular polarization, the photon's helicity is ±1. If the photon is emitted in a certain direction, its helicity corresponds to its spin projection along the direction of motion. \n\nSo for the first photon γ₁, emitted from J=0 to J=1. Let me think about the possible transitions. Since the initial state is J=0, m=0. The transition to J=1 must involve emitting a photon with angular momentum such that ΔJ = -1 (since the atom goes from 0 to 1, so the photon must carry away -1? Wait, angular momentum conservation: J_initial = J_final + photon angular momentum. So 0 = 1 + photon angular momentum. Therefore, the photon angular momentum is -1. But the photon's angular momentum is along its direction of propagation. Therefore, if the photon is emitted in some direction, its angular momentum is -1 relative to that direction. \n\nBut circular polarization is related to the helicity, which is the projection of spin along the direction of motion. So if the photon is emitted in direction **k**, then its helicity is ±1. \n\nBut how does this relate to the angular momentum of the photon? The photon's angular momentum is along **k**, so if the atom's angular momentum is opposite, then the photon's helicity would be -1 if the atom's angular momentum is +1? \n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and the matrix elements for the transition. The dipole transition operator is a vector operator, so it couples states with ΔJ = 0, ±1 (except 0↔0). Since we go from J=0 to J=1, the matrix element must correspond to a transition that changes the angular momentum by 1. \n\nIn terms of the photon emission, the polarization vectors of the photon are related to the angular momentum. For circular polarization, the polarization vectors correspond to ±1 helicity. \n\nSo, for the first transition, since the initial state is J=0, the emitted photon must have angular momentum such that the final state of the atom has J=1. Let me think about the possible m values. \n\nThe initial state is |J=0, m=0>. The final state is |J=1, m> ⊗ |photon state>. The total angular momentum must still be 0. \n\nSo the photon must carry away angular momentum such that when combined with the atom's angular momentum, the total is 0. \n\nTherefore, the atom's angular momentum m and the photon's angular momentum must add to zero. \n\nIf the atom ends up in m = +1, then the photon must have angular momentum -1 (helicity -1, right circular polarization if direction is considered). Similarly, if the atom is in m = -1, the photon has +1 helicity. If the atom is in m=0, the photon must have 0? But photons can't have 0 helicity. \n\nWait, but for dipole transitions, the change in m is Δm = 0, ±1. However, for the transition from J=0 to J=1, the Δm can be ±1 or 0? Wait, no. The initial state has m=0. The final state can have m = -1, 0, +1. But since the photon carries away angular momentum, the change in m for the atom is equal to the photon's angular momentum. \n\nBut since the photon's angular momentum is along its direction of propagation, which is arbitrary. However, in the initial state, there is no preferred direction, so the final state must be a superposition of all possible m's? \n\nBut how does this relate to the polarization of the photon? \n\nI think the key here is that for a dipole transition from J=0 to J=1, the photon must have angular momentum opposite to the atom's angular momentum. Therefore, if the atom ends up in m=+1, the photon has angular momentum -1 (helicity -1). If the atom is in m=-1, the photon has +1 helicity. If the atom is in m=0, the photon would have 0 helicity, which is not possible. Therefore, only transitions with Δm = ±1 are allowed, and the photon has helicity ∓1. \n\nTherefore, the first photon γ₁ has helicity -1 if the atom is in m=+1, and +1 if the atom is in m=-1. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric (J=0), all directions are equally probable. Therefore, the probabilities for the atom to end up in m=+1, m=0, m=-1? Wait, but only m=±1 are allowed? Because m=0 would require the photon to have m=0, which isn't possible. \n\nSo the transition from J=0 to J=1 must result in the atom being in m=+1 or -1 with equal probability, and the photon having opposite helicity. Therefore, the first photon γ₁ has helicity either +1 or -1 with equal probability? Wait, no. If the atom is in m=+1, the photon has helicity -1. If the atom is in m=-1, the photon has helicity +1. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the probabilities for the atom to go to m=+1 or m=-1 are equal. Therefore, the first photon γ₁ has helicity -1 or +1 with equal probability. \n\nSo the polarization of γ₁ is equally likely to be left or right circular? Depending on the direction of emission. Wait, but the direction of emission is arbitrary. However, in the problem, we are considering two photons emitted in some directions with angle θ between them. \n\nNow, the second transition is from ¹P₁ (J=1) to ¹S₀ (J=0). So similar logic applies. The atom is in J=1, and emits a photon to go to J=0. So again, angular momentum conservation requires that the photon carries away the entire angular momentum of the atom. \n\nSo if the atom is in |J=1, m>, then the photon must carry away angular momentum -m. Therefore, the photon's helicity is -m? Or m? Wait, similar to before. If the atom is in m, then the photon must carry away angular momentum such that total angular momentum is conserved. \n\nSo initial J=1, m. Final J=0. Therefore, photon must carry away angular momentum m. Because initial J = final J + photon angular momentum. So 1, m = 0 + photon angular momentum. Therefore, the photon angular momentum is m. But the photon's angular momentum is along its direction of propagation. \n\nBut here's the thing: the direction of propagation of the second photon γ₂ is at an angle θ with respect to the direction of γ₁. Therefore, the coordinate system for the polarization of γ₂ is rotated by θ relative to that of γ₁. \n\nTherefore, to find the relation between the polarizations of γ₁ and γ₂, we need to relate their helicities in different coordinate systems. \n\nBut how do we relate the helicity of γ₂ in its own direction to the helicity of γ₁ in its direction? The rotation matrix given is the Wigner d-matrix for l=1, which relates the angular momentum eigenstates in different coordinate systems. \n\nSo perhaps the idea is that the m values of the second photon (γ₂) are related to the m values of the first photon (γ₁) through this rotation matrix. \n\nLet me think step by step. \n\nFirst, the first photon γ₁ is emitted with some polarization (helicity). Let's suppose that in its own coordinate system (aligned with its direction of propagation), it has helicity σ₁ (either +1 or -1). Similarly, the second photon γ₂ has helicity σ₂ in its own coordinate system (aligned with its direction). The angle between their directions is θ. \n\nBut since the coordinate systems are different, we need to relate σ₂ to σ₁ through the rotation matrix. \n\nAlternatively, since the atom's state after emitting γ₁ is in a state with some m value, and then when it emits γ₂, the photon's polarization depends on that m value. However, because the direction of γ₂ is at angle θ relative to γ₁, we need to rotate the angular momentum state to express it in the coordinate system of γ₂. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nFirst transition: ¹S₀ (J=0) → ¹P₁ (J=1) + γ₁. \n\nAs discussed, the atom ends up in |J=1, m⟩, and the photon γ₁ has helicity -m (since the photon's angular momentum is -m to conserve angular momentum). Wait, earlier I thought that if the atom is in m, the photon carries away -m? Wait, initial J=0. Final J=1 (atom) + photon J. So 0 = 1 + photon J. Therefore, photon J = -1. But photon J is along its direction of propagation. \n\nBut the photon's angular momentum is related to its helicity. Suppose the photon is emitted in direction **k₁**, then its helicity σ₁ is the projection of its spin along **k₁**. \n\nSimilarly, for the second transition, the atom is in J=1 state, which was prepared by the first transition. Then it emits γ₂ in direction **k₂**, which makes an angle θ with **k₁**. The photon γ₂ has helicity σ₂, which is the projection of its spin along **k₂**. \n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of probabilities that σ₁ and σ₂ are the same versus opposite. \n\nBut how do σ₁ and σ₂ relate? Because the angular momentum state of the atom after the first transition is |J=1, m⟩, which is in the coordinate system aligned with **k₁**. However, when considering the second transition, we need to express this state in the coordinate system aligned with **k₂**, which is rotated by angle θ around the axis perpendicular to both **k₁** and **k₂** (assuming they are in a plane). \n\nTherefore, the m values in the second coordinate system (aligned with **k₂**) are related to the original m values by the rotation matrix d₁^{m' m}(θ). \n\nTherefore, if the atom is in |m⟩ in the first coordinate system, then in the second coordinate system, it is a superposition of |m'⟩ states given by the d-matrix elements. \n\nTherefore, the probability of emitting a photon with helicity σ₂ in the second transition depends on the m' value of the atom in the rotated coordinate system. \n\nBut the helicity of γ₂ is related to m' in a similar way as before. For the second transition from J=1 to J=0, the photon must carry away angular momentum equal to the atom's m' value. Therefore, the helicity σ₂ is equal to m' (since photon angular momentum is along **k₂**, so σ₂ = m'). \n\nWait, earlier for the first transition, the photon's helicity was -m. For the second transition, if the atom is in m', then the photon must carry away angular momentum m', so its helicity is m'? \n\nWait, let me check again. For the second transition: initial state is J=1, m'. Final state is J=0. So angular momentum conservation: J_initial = J_final + photon angular momentum. Therefore, 1, m' = 0 + photon angular momentum. Therefore, photon angular momentum is m' in the coordinate system aligned with **k₂**. Since photon angular momentum is along **k₂**, its helicity is m'. Therefore, σ₂ = m'. \n\nSimilarly, for the first transition, initial J=0, final J=1, m. Therefore, photon angular momentum is -m, so helicity σ₁ = -m. \n\nTherefore, σ₁ = -m, σ₂ = m', where m is in the first coordinate system, and m' is in the second coordinate system. \n\nBut since the atom's state is rotated from the first to the second coordinate system, the relation between m and m' is given by the d-matrix. \n\nTherefore, if the atom was prepared in |m⟩ in the first coordinate system, then in the second coordinate system, it is:\n\n|ψ⟩ = Σ_{m'} d₁^{m' m}(θ) |m'⟩\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring m' is |d₁^{m' m}(θ)|². \n\nBut since σ₂ = m', and σ₁ = -m, the relation between σ₁ and σ₂ depends on m and m'. \n\nBut we need to consider all possible initial m (from the first transition) and then the probabilities for σ₁ and σ₂. \n\nFirst, let's recall that in the first transition, the atom can be in m = +1, 0, -1? Wait, no. Earlier we thought that only m=±1 are possible because for the transition from J=0 to J=1, the photon must carry away angular momentum. Since the photon can't have m=0, the atom can't end up in m=0. Therefore, only m=+1 and m=-1 are possible, each with probability 1/2. \n\nTherefore, the first photon γ₁ has helicity σ₁ = -m. So if the atom is in m=+1, σ₁ = -1; if m=-1, σ₁ = +1. \n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: Atom in m=+1 (σ₁=-1)\n\nCase 2: Atom in m=-1 (σ₁=+1)\n\nEach with probability 1/2.\n\nFor each case, we need to find the probability distribution of σ₂, then compute the probabilities that σ₁ and σ₂ are same or opposite.\n\nSo let's handle Case 1: Atom in m=+1 in first coordinate system.\n\nWe need to express this state in the second coordinate system (rotated by θ). The state |m=+1⟩ in the first coordinate system is:\n\n|ψ⟩ = Σ_{m'} d₁^{m' 1}(θ) |m'⟩ in the second coordinate system.\n\nFrom the given d-matrix:\n\nFor m=1 column:\n\nm'=1: (1 + cosθ)/2\n\nm'=0: (sinθ)/√2\n\nm'=-1: (1 - cosθ)/2\n\nTherefore, the state is:\n\n|ψ⟩ = [(1 + cosθ)/2] |1⟩ + [sinθ/√2] |0⟩ + [(1 - cosθ)/2] |-1⟩\n\nBut in the second transition, the atom can only emit a photon with σ₂ = m', and since the transition is from J=1 to J=0, the only allowed m' are those for which the atom can emit a photon. However, similar to before, the photon can have helicity m', which is ±1 or 0? Wait no, for the photon, helicity must be ±1. Therefore, even though the atom's state can have m'=0, the photon cannot have m'=0. Therefore, only m'=+1 and m'=-1 are allowed for the second photon. \n\nWait, but how does that work? If the atom is in m'=0 in the rotated coordinate system, can it emit a photon? \n\nBut angular momentum conservation requires that the photon carries away the entire angular momentum of the atom. So if the atom is in m'=0, then the photon must carry away 0 angular momentum, which is impossible. Therefore, only m'=±1 are allowed. Therefore, in the second transition, the atom can only be in m'=+1 or m'=-1, with the corresponding photon helicities σ₂=+1 or -1. \n\nTherefore, the |0⟩ component in the rotated state cannot contribute to the second photon emission. Therefore, we need to normalize the probabilities for m'=+1 and m'=-1. \n\nWait, but how do we handle this? In reality, the transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements. For electric dipole transitions, the transition probability is proportional to |⟨J', m' | T | J, m ⟩|², where T is the dipole operator. But since we are dealing with angular momentum coupling, perhaps the allowed transitions are only those with Δm = ±1, similar to the first transition. \n\nWait, but in the second transition, the atom is going from J=1 to J=0. The dipole operator is a vector operator, which can change m by 0, ±1. However, since J_final = 0, the only possible Δm is such that m_final = 0 = m_initial + Δm_photon. Therefore, Δm_photon = -m_initial. \n\nBut the photon's Δm_photon is its helicity. Therefore, if the atom is in m', then the photon must have helicity -m' to satisfy angular momentum conservation? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nInitial angular momentum: J_initial = 1, m'. Final angular momentum: J_final = 0. Therefore, photon angular momentum must be equal to J_initial - J_final = 1, m'. Therefore, the photon must carry away angular momentum 1, m'. Therefore, its helicity is m', as discussed earlier. \n\nBut how can the photon have m'=0? It can't. Therefore, only m'=±1 are allowed. Therefore, the |0⟩ component cannot contribute. Therefore, when considering the second transition, we must discard the |0⟩ component and normalize the remaining probabilities. \n\nTherefore, for Case 1 (atom in m=+1 initially), the rotated state has components:\n\nFor m'=+1: [(1 + cosθ)/2]\n\nFor m'=0: [sinθ/√2]\n\nFor m'=-1: [(1 - cosθ)/2]\n\nBut only m'=+1 and m'=-1 can contribute to photon emission. Therefore, the probability amplitudes for these are [(1 + cosθ)/2] and [(1 - cosθ)/2], respectively. However, we need to normalize these probabilities because the |0⟩ component is not contributing. \n\nThe total probability for m'=±1 is |(1 + cosθ)/2|² + |(1 - cosθ)/2|². Wait, but actually, since we are discarding the |0⟩ component, we need to normalize the remaining amplitudes. However, the original state before considering selection rules is:\n\nA_{+1} = (1 + cosθ)/2\n\nA_{0} = sinθ/√2\n\nA_{-1} = (1 - cosθ)/2\n\nBut since the |0⟩ component cannot lead to a photon emission, we need to consider only the |+1⟩ and |-1⟩ components. However, the question is, are these components already normalized? No. Because originally, the sum of squares of all components is 1:\n\n[(1 + cosθ)/2]^2 + [sinθ/√2]^2 + [(1 - cosθ)/2]^2 \n\nLet me check:\n\nFirst term: (1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ)/4\n\nThird term: (1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ)/4\n\nAdding them: [1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ + 1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ]/4 + [sin²θ]/2 \n\n= [2 + 2cos²θ]/4 + sin²θ/2 \n\n= [1 + cos²θ]/2 + sin²θ/2 \n\n= [1 + cos²θ + sin²θ]/2 \n\n= [1 + 1]/2 = 1. \n\nYes, correct. Therefore, if we discard the |0⟩ component, the remaining probability is 1 - |A_0|² = 1 - [sin²θ / 2]. \n\nBut since we are considering only the cases where the second photon is emitted, we need to normalize the remaining amplitudes. \n\nHowever, in reality, the probability of emitting the second photon is 1, since the ¹P₁ state has a short lifetime. Therefore, perhaps the |0⟩ component is not physically present because it cannot emit a photon. Therefore, maybe we should consider that only the |+1⟩ and |-1⟩ components contribute, and their probabilities are proportional to |A_{+1}|² and |A_{-1}|². \n\nBut how do we handle this? Maybe the selection rules for the dipole transition require that Δm = 0, ±1, but for the transition from J=1 to J=0, only Δm = -m' is allowed? Wait, no. The dipole transition operator has components that can change m by 0, ±1. However, since the final state is J=0, m=0, the photon must carry away angular momentum such that m_initial + photon_m = 0. Therefore, photon_m = -m_initial. \n\nTherefore, if the atom is in m', the photon must have m = -m'. But the photon's m is its helicity. Therefore, σ₂ = -m'. \n\nWait, this is conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me re-examine. \n\nAngular momentum conservation: initial J = 1, m'; final J = 0. Therefore, photon angular momentum must be equal to initial J - final J = 1, m'. Therefore, photon has angular momentum 1, m'. But photon's angular momentum is along its direction of propagation, which is the direction of γ₂. Therefore, the photon's helicity is m'. \n\nBut if the photon's helicity is m', then how does that relate to the atom's m'? \n\nWait, maybe my previous conclusion was wrong. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the atom is in state |J=1, m'⟩. It emits a photon to go to |J=0⟩. The photon must carry away angular momentum such that total angular momentum is conserved. \n\nSo initial total angular momentum: |J=1, m'⟩. \n\nFinal total angular momentum: |J=0⟩ ⊗ |photon state⟩. \n\nTherefore, the photon state must be such that the total angular momentum is |J=1, m'⟩. \n\nTherefore, the photon state must be |J=1, m'⟩. \n\nBut the photon's angular momentum is along its direction of propagation. Therefore, if the photon is emitted in direction **k₂**, then its angular momentum is m' in that direction. Therefore, its helicity is m'. \n\nTherefore, σ₂ = m'. \n\nBut earlier, for the first transition, σ₁ = -m. \n\nSo in Case 1, where the atom is in m=+1 (first coordinate system), rotated to the second coordinate system, we have amplitudes for m'=+1, 0, -1. \n\nBut only m'=+1 and -1 can emit photons with helicity +1 and -1. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the second photon has σ₂ = +1 is |A_{+1}|² / (|A_{+1}|² + |A_{-1}|²) ?\n\nWait, but the total probability of emitting a photon is 1, so maybe we don't need to normalize, because the |0⟩ component cannot emit a photon and is therefore not part of the physical state? \n\nBut how is that possible? The atom is in ¹P₁, which has J=1, so it must decay to J=0, emitting a photon. Therefore, the |0⟩ component cannot contribute, so the initial state must not have that component. \n\nBut how does that happen? The initial state after the first transition is |m=+1⟩ in the first coordinate system. When we rotate it to the second coordinate system, we get a superposition including |0⟩. But since the |0⟩ cannot emit a photon, perhaps that component is somehow excluded? \n\nThis seems like a problem. Maybe the initial state isn't just |m=+1⟩, but actually a state that when rotated, only has components that can emit photons? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selection rules apply in the second transition such that only certain m' are allowed. \n\nBut in reality, the dipole transition from J=1 to J=0 allows any m' such that the photon can carry away angular momentum. Since the dipole operator is a vector operator, the transition is allowed for any m', as long as Δm = ±1 or 0? Wait, but for the transition from J=1 to J=0, the selection rule is ΔJ = -1, and Δm = 0, ±1. \n\nBut since the final J is 0, m_final = 0. Therefore, the photon must carry away angular momentum such that m_initial + photon_m = 0. Therefore, photon_m = -m_initial. \n\nTherefore, if the atom is in m', then the photon must have m = -m'. But the photon's m is its helicity. Therefore, σ₂ = -m'. \n\nWait, this is different from before. Let me re-express. \n\nIf the atom is in |J=1, m'⟩, and emits a photon to go to |J=0, m=0⟩, then angular momentum conservation requires:\n\n|J=1, m'⟩ = |J=0, m=0⟩ ⊗ |photon⟩ \n\nTherefore, the photon must be in a state such that when combined with |0⟩ gives |1, m'⟩. Therefore, the photon must be in |1, m'⟩. \n\nBut the photon's angular momentum is along its direction of propagation. Therefore, if the photon is emitted in direction **k₂**, then its angular momentum is m' in that direction. Therefore, its helicity is m'. \n\nBut earlier I thought σ₂ = -m', but now it seems σ₂ = m'. Which is correct? \n\nLet me think of a specific example. Suppose the atom is in m'=+1 in the second coordinate system (aligned with γ₂'s direction). Then, it emits a photon in the direction of γ₂. The photon must carry away angular momentum +1 in that direction, so its helicity is +1. Therefore, σ₂ = +1. \n\nBut angular momentum conservation says that the initial angular momentum (m'=+1) is equal to the final angular momentum (0) plus the photon's angular momentum. Therefore, photon's angular momentum is +1. Hence, yes, σ₂ = +1. \n\nTherefore, my previous conclusion was correct: σ₂ = m'. \n\nBut then, if the atom is in m'=+1, the photon has σ₂=+1. If the atom is in m'=-1, photon has σ₂=-1. \n\nBut how does this relate to the first photon's helicity? \n\nIn Case 1, where the first photon has σ₁=-1 (atom in m=+1 in first coordinate system), when rotated to the second coordinate system, the atom is in a superposition of m'=+1, 0, -1. The |0⟩ component can't emit a photon, so we only consider m'=+1 and m'=-1. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the second photon has σ₂=+1 is |A_{+1}|² and σ₂=-1 is |A_{-1}|². \n\nBut wait, since the total probability for these two is |A_{+1}|² + |A_{-1}|² = [(1 + cosθ)/2]^2 + [(1 - cosθ)/2]^2 = [ (1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ) + (1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ) ] / 4 = [2 + 2cos²θ]/4 = [1 + cos²θ]/2. \n\nBut the |A_0|² is sin²θ / 2. \n\nBut since the atom must emit a photon, we have to normalize the probabilities for σ₂. Therefore, the conditional probabilities are:\n\nP(σ₂=+1 | Case 1) = |A_{+1}|² / (|A_{+1}|² + |A_{-1}|²) = [ (1 + cosθ)^2 / 4 ] / [ (1 + cos²θ)/2 ] = [ (1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ)/4 ] / [ (1 + cos²θ)/2 ] = [ (1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ)/4 ] * [ 2 / (1 + cos²θ) ] = (1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ) / [ 2(1 + cos²θ) ] \n\nSimilarly for P(σ₂=-1 | Case 1) = [ (1 - cosθ)^2 / 4 ] / [ (1 + cos²θ)/2 ] = [ (1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ)/4 ] * [ 2 / (1 + cos²θ) ] = (1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ) / [ 2(1 + cos²θ) ]\n\nAlternatively, simplifying numerator and denominator:\n\nNote that 1 + cos²θ is in the denominator. Let me compute these probabilities:\n\nFor σ₂=+1:\n\nNumerator: (1 + cosθ)^2 = 1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ\n\nDenominator: 2(1 + cos²θ)\n\nSimilarly for σ₂=-1: numerator is (1 - cosθ)^2 = 1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a better way to write this. Let me compute:\n\nLet me denote cosθ = c for simplicity.\n\nThen:\n\nP(+1) = (1 + 2c + c²) / [2(1 + c²)] = [ (1 + c²) + 2c ] / [2(1 + c²) ] = 1/2 + c / (1 + c²)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(-1) = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / [2(1 + c²) ] = [ (1 + c²) - 2c ] / [2(1 + c²) ] = 1/2 - c / (1 + c²)\n\nBut I don't know if this helps. \n\nAlternatively, note that 1 + cos²θ = 1 + c², and the numerators are (1 ± cosθ)^2. \n\nBut maybe we can leave it as it is for now. \n\nSimilarly, in Case 2, where the atom is initially in m=-1 (first coordinate system), leading to σ₁=+1. \n\nFollowing similar logic, we need to rotate |m=-1⟩ in the first coordinate system to the second coordinate system. \n\nLooking at the d-matrix for m=-1 column:\n\nFor m' = 1: (1 - cosθ)/2 \n\nFor m' = 0: -sinθ / √2 \n\nFor m' = -1: (1 + cosθ)/2 \n\nTherefore, the rotated state is:\n\n[(1 - cosθ)/2] |1⟩ - [sinθ / √2] |0⟩ + [(1 + cosθ)/2] |-1⟩\n\nAgain, discarding the |0⟩ component, the amplitudes for m'=+1 and m'=-1 are [(1 - cosθ)/2] and [(1 + cosθ)/2], respectively. \n\nTherefore, the probabilities for σ₂ are:\n\nP(σ₂=+1 | Case 2) = |A_{+1}|² / (|A_{+1}|² + |A_{-1}|²) = [(1 - cosθ)^2 / 4] / [ ( (1 - cosθ)^2 + (1 + cosθ)^2 ) / 4 ] = same denominator as before, [ (1 + cos²θ)/2 ] ?\n\nWait, let me compute denominator:\n\n(1 - cosθ)^2 + (1 + cosθ)^2 = 1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ + 1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ = 2 + 2cos²θ, same as before. Therefore denominator is same [ (2 + 2cos²θ)/4 ] * 2 = same as before.\n\nTherefore, P(σ₂=+1 | Case 2) = (1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ) / [ 2(1 + cos²θ) ] \n\nSimilarly, P(σ₂=-1 | Case 2) = (1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ) / [ 2(1 + cos²θ) ]\n\nTherefore, now, we can compute for each case, the probabilities that σ₁ and σ₂ are same or opposite. \n\nLet me tabulate:\n\nCase 1: σ₁ = -1 \n\n- P(σ₂=+1) = [ (1 + 2c + c²) ] / [ 2(1 + c²) ] \n\n- P(σ₂=-1) = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / [ 2(1 + c²) ]\n\nTherefore, probability same: σ₁=-1 and σ₂=-1 → P_same = P(σ₂=-1) \n\nProbability opposite: σ₁=-1 and σ₂=+1 → P_opposite = P(σ₂=+1)\n\nCase 2: σ₁ = +1 \n\n- P(σ₂=+1) = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / [ 2(1 + c²) ] \n\n- P(σ₂=-1) = [ (1 + 2c + c²) ] / [ 2(1 + c²) ]\n\nTherefore, probability same: σ₁=+1 and σ₂=+1 → P_same = P(σ₂=+1) \n\nProbability opposite: σ₁=+1 and σ₂=-1 → P_opposite = P(σ₂=-1)\n\nSince each case (Case 1 and Case 2) has probability 1/2 (from the first transition), the total probabilities are:\n\nP_total_same = (1/2)*P_same_case1 + (1/2)*P_same_case2 \n\n= (1/2)*[ (1 - 2c + c²)/D + (1 - 2c + c²)/D ] ?\n\nWait no. Wait, in Case 1, P_same_case1 is P(σ₂=-1 | Case 1) = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / [ 2(1 + c²) ]\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2, P_same_case2 is P(σ₂=+1 | Case 2) = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / [ 2(1 + c²) ]\n\nTherefore, P_total_same = (1/2)*[ (1 - 2c + c²)/D + (1 - 2c + c²)/D ] where D = 2(1 + c²). Wait, no:\n\nWait D is already in the denominator. Let me re-express:\n\nFor Case 1: P_same_case1 = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / [ 2(1 + c²) ]\n\nSimilarly for Case 2: same value. Therefore:\n\nP_total_same = (1/2 + 1/2) * [ (1 - 2c + c²) / [ 2(1 + c²) ] ] ?\n\nWait no, each case contributes (1/2)*P_same_case. Therefore:\n\nP_total_same = (1/2)*[ (1 - 2c + c²)/D ] + (1/2)*[ (1 - 2c + c²)/D ] where D = 2(1 + c²). Wait, no:\n\nActually, D is already included in the probabilities. Let me write:\n\nLet me denote D = 2(1 + cos²θ). \n\nFor Case 1: P_same_case1 = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / D \n\nFor Case 2: P_same_case2 = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / D \n\nTherefore, P_total_same = (1/2)( [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / D ) + (1/2)( [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / D ) = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / D \n\nSimilarly, P_total_opposite = [ (1 + 2c + c²) ] / D \n\nTherefore, the ratio P_same / P_opposite = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / [ (1 + 2c + c²) ] \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1 - 2c + c² = (1 - c)^2 \n\nDenominator: 1 + 2c + c² = (1 + c)^2 \n\nTherefore, the ratio is [ (1 - cosθ)^2 ] / [ (1 + cosθ)^2 ] \n\nWhich simplifies to [ (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) ]² \n\nBut the question asks for the ratio of probabilities that the circular polarization directions are same and opposite. \n\nWait, but we have P_same / P_opposite = [ (1 - cosθ)^2 / (1 + cosθ)^2 ]\n\nBut let me check the algebra again to make sure. \n\nYes, since P_total_same = (1 - 2c + c²)/D and P_total_opposite = (1 + 2c + c²)/D. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is (1 - 2c + c²)/(1 + 2c + c²) = [(1 - c)^2]/[(1 + c)^2]. \n\nAlternatively, we can write this ratio in terms of trigonometric identities. \n\nRecall that 1 - cosθ = 2sin²(θ/2) and 1 + cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2). \n\nTherefore, [ (1 - cosθ)^2 / (1 + cosθ)^2 ] = [ 4 sin⁴(θ/2) / 4 cos⁴(θ/2) ] = tan⁴(θ/2). \n\nBut the problem asks for the ratio of same to opposite. Therefore, the answer is tan⁴(θ/2). \n\nBut let me check if I didn't mix up same and opposite. \n\nIn Case 1, same is when σ₁=-1 and σ₂=-1, which is P_same_case1 = [ (1 - 2c + c²) ] / D \n\nIn Case 2, same is σ₁=+1 and σ₂=+1, which is P_same_case2 = same value. \n\nTherefore, total same is sum of both. \n\nOpposite is when σ₁=-1 and σ₂=+1 or σ₁=+1 and σ₂=-1, which are P_opposite_case1 and P_opposite_case2, each equal to [ (1 + 2c + c²)/D ] and summed to same total opposite. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is indeed [ (1 - cosθ)^2 / (1 + cosθ)^2 ] = tan⁴(θ/2). \n\nBut let me check with a specific angle. For example, θ=0. \n\nIf θ=0, the two photons are emitted in the same direction. What should the ratio be? \n\nIn this case, the polarizations are in the same direction. However, since the first photon has σ₁=-m and the second σ₂=m', but with θ=0, the coordinate systems are the same. \n\nWait, if θ=0, then the rotation matrix is identity? Let me check the d-matrix at θ=0. \n\nFor θ=0, cosθ=1, sinθ=0. \n\nThe d-matrix becomes:\n\nFor m=1 column:\n\nm'=1: (1 + 1)/2 = 1 \n\nm'=0: 0 \n\nm'=-1: (1 - 1)/2 = 0 \n\nSimilarly for other columns. Therefore, the rotation matrix at θ=0 is identity. Therefore, if the atom is in m=+1, then in the second coordinate system it's still m=+1. Therefore, σ₂=+1. But σ₁=-1 (since σ₁=-m). Therefore, σ₁=-1 and σ₂=+1. Therefore, they are opposite. Wait, but according to our formula, tan⁴(0/2)=0, which would imply P_same / P_opposite = 0. Which is correct because when θ=0, same direction, the polarizations are opposite. Therefore, ratio same/opposite is 0. \n\nBut let me think again. If θ=0, photons are emitted in same direction. The first photon has helicity σ₁=-m. The second photon has helicity σ₂=m. Since the atom is in m=+1 or -1. \n\nIf first photon is emitted with σ₁=-1 (atom m=+1), then second photon has σ₂=+1 (same direction, same coordinate system). Therefore, polarizations are opposite. Similarly for the other case. Therefore, ratio same/opposite is 0, which matches our formula. \n\nAnother test case: θ=π. The photons are emitted in opposite directions. \n\nFor θ=π, cosθ=-1, sinθ=0. \n\nThen, the ratio is [ (1 - (-1))^2 / (1 + (-1))^2 ] = [ (2)^2 / 0 ] which is undefined. Wait, but denominator is zero. \n\nBut θ=π, let's compute manually. \n\nFor θ=π, the rotation matrix for m=1 column:\n\nm'=1: (1 + cosπ)/2 = (1 -1)/2 = 0 \n\nm'=0: sinπ / √2 = 0 \n\nm'=-1: (1 - cosπ)/2 = (1 - (-1))/2 = 1 \n\nTherefore, the rotated state for Case 1 (initial m=+1) is |m'=-1⟩. Therefore, σ₂=-1. \n\nSince σ₁=-1 (from Case 1), σ₂=-1. Therefore, same polarization. Similarly for Case 2: initial m=-1, rotated to m'=+1 (since for m=-1 column, at θ=π, m'=-1 entry is (1 + cosθ)/2 = 0 + 1? Wait let me check:\n\nFor m=-1 column at θ=π:\n\nm'=1: (1 - cosθ)/2 = (1 - (-1))/2 = 1 \n\nm'=0: +sinθ / √2 = 0 \n\nm'=-1: (1 + cosθ)/2 = (1 + (-1))/2 = 0 \n\nTherefore, rotated state for Case 2 (initial m=-1) is |m'=+1⟩. Therefore, σ₂=+1. Since σ₁=+1 (Case 2), same polarization. \n\nTherefore, for θ=π, P_same=1, P_opposite=0. Therefore, ratio same/opposite is infinity. \n\nAccording to our formula, tan⁴(π/2). tan(π/2) is infinity, so tan⁴(π/2) is infinity. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: θ=π/2. Then cosθ=0, sinθ=1. \n\nRatio is [ (1 - 0)^2 / (1 + 0)^2 ] = 1. Therefore, same/opposite ratio is 1. \n\nLet me check manually. \n\nFor θ=π/2, Case 1: initial m=+1. Rotated state:\n\nA_{+1} = (1 + 0)/2 = 1/2 \n\nA_0 = 1/√2 \n\nA_{-1} = (1 - 0)/2 = 1/2 \n\nDiscard A_0. Then probabilities for σ₂=+1 is |1/2|² / (|1/2|² + |1/2|² ) = (1/4) / (1/2) = 1/2. Similarly for σ₂=-1. Therefore, P_same = probability that σ₁=-1 and σ₂=-1 is 1/2, and P_opposite is 1/2. Therefore, ratio is 1. Correct. \n\nTherefore, our formula seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of probabilities that the circular polarization directions are same to opposite is tan⁴(θ/2). \n\nBut let me check if there is another way to write this. Alternatively, using trigonometric identities:\n\ntan²(θ/2) = (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ)\n\nTherefore tan⁴(θ/2) = [(1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ)]² \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is expected in terms of sinθ. Let me see:\n\n(1 - cosθ)^2 / (1 + cosθ)^2 = [ (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 cos²(θ/2)) ]² = tan⁴(θ/2). \n\nAlternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 - cosθ)^2 or something else? Not sure. \n\nBut the problem asks for the ratio. So unless there is a simplification required, tan⁴(θ/2) is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, another approach could have led to the same result. For example, considering the transition amplitudes and using the rotation matrix. \n\nBut given that the test cases check out, I think this is correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of probabilities is tan⁴(θ/2). \n\nBut let me check if there's a factor I missed. For example, considering that in each case the probabilities are normalized. \n\nWait, in our calculation, we considered that for each Case 1 and 2, we normalized the probabilities by discarding the |0⟩ component. However, is this physically accurate? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the |0⟩ component does not contribute to the emission, so the probabilities for the second photon are only from the |+1⟩ and |-1⟩ components, and hence the probabilities are |A_{+1}|² and |A_{-1}|² without normalization. However, in that case, the total probability would be |A_{+1}|² + |A_{-1}|² = [ (1 + cosθ)^2 + (1 - cosθ)^2 ] / 4 = [ 2 + 2cos²θ ] / 4 = (1 + cos²θ)/2. But since the atom must emit a photon, this probability is 1. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. \n\nWait, no. The total probability of emitting a photon is 1, so the |0⟩ component must not exist. Therefore, the rotated state must not have a |0⟩ component. But how? \n\nAh! Actually, the initial state after the first transition is not just |m=+1⟩ or |m=-1⟩. Because the first transition from J=0 to J=1 must be such that when you rotate it, you don't get a |0⟩ component. \n\nWait, this suggests a flaw in my earlier reasoning. Because if the atom is in a state that, when rotated, doesn't have a |0⟩ component, then the selection rules are already satisfied. \n\nBut how is that possible? The first transition results in the atom being in |m=+1⟩ or |m=-1⟩. However, when you rotate this state, you get a superposition including |0⟩. But since the |0⟩ component cannot emit a photon, perhaps the actual state of the atom after the first transition is not just |m=+1⟩, but a state that when rotated, only has |+1⟩ and |-1⟩ components. \n\nThis seems contradictory. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the atom is in a definite m state after the first transition. In reality, the first transition from J=0 to J=1 must result in a state that is symmetric in some way. \n\nWait, the initial state is J=0, which is spherically symmetric. Therefore, the emitted photon's direction is random, and the atom's state after emission is in a state with J=1, but with m dependent on the photon's emission direction. \n\nHowever, if we consider that the first photon is emitted in some arbitrary direction, and then we look at the second photon emitted at angle θ relative to the first, we need to consider the angular correlation. \n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the entire process is described by the Wigner d-matrix elements. \n\nAlternatively, think about the entire amplitude for the two-photon emission. \n\nThe initial state is |0, 0⟩. The first transition to |1, m⟩ and photon γ₁ with σ₁=-m. Then the second transition to |0, 0⟩ and photon γ₂ with σ₂=m', where m' is related to the rotated m. \n\nThe total amplitude is then the product of the first transition amplitude and the second transition amplitude, considering the rotation. \n\nBut since the first transition is from |0⟩ to |1, m⟩, which has amplitude proportional to 1 (since for J=0 to J=1, all m are equally probable?), but actually, for a dipole transition from J=0, the matrix element is proportional to the spherical harmonic Y₁^m, which for J=0 has some amplitude. However, due to spherical symmetry, all directions are equally probable, so the probability for each m is equal. Since there are three m's (-1, 0, +1), but only m=±1 are allowed because of the photon's helicity. Wait, but earlier we thought only m=±1 are allowed. \n\nBut this brings us back to the same problem: if the atom is in m=±1, then when rotated, it can have |0⟩ component which cannot emit a photon. \n\nPerhaps the resolution is that the actual state of the atom after the first transition is not a pure |m⟩ state, but a state that is symmetric under rotation. \n\nWait, the first transition is from J=0 to J=1. The dipole operator is a vector operator, so the matrix element ⟨1, m | T | 0, 0 ⟩ is proportional to ⟨1, m | T | 0, 0 ⟩, which is non-zero only for m=±1, 0? No, for vector operator, the selection rule is ΔJ=0, ±1 (except 0↔0). From J=0 to J=1, any m is allowed? No, the matrix element depends on the component of the vector operator. \n\nActually, the dipole operator has three components, corresponding to the three spherical components T^{(1)}_{+1}, T^{(1)}_0, T^{(1)}_{-1}. The matrix element ⟨1, m | T^{(1)}_{q} | 0, 0 ⟩ is non-zero only if m = q. Because of angular momentum addition. Therefore, for each q=+1, 0, -1, there is a transition to m=q. \n\nTherefore, the atom after the first transition is in a state |1, q⟩ with q=+1, 0, -1, each with probability |⟨1, q | T^{(1)}_{q} | 0, 0 ⟩|². Assuming the dipole operator is the same in all directions, these probabilities are equal for q=+1, 0, -1. \n\nBut wait, the photon can't have q=0, so how does that work? \n\nAh! Here's the key. The emitted photon's polarization is related to the component of the dipole operator. For q=+1 and -1, the photon has circular polarization. For q=0, the photon would have linear polarization, but since we are considering circular polarization, maybe the q=0 component corresponds to a linear polarization photon, which is not considered here. \n\nBut the problem specifies circular polarization directions. Therefore, perhaps we should consider only the q=±1 components. \n\nTherefore, the probability for the atom to be in m=+1 or -1 is equal, and the q=0 component is disregarded because it corresponds to linear polarization. \n\nTherefore, the initial state after the first transition is a superposition of |+1⟩ and |-1⟩ with equal probability, as we assumed earlier. \n\nTherefore, our previous calculation holds, and the |0⟩ component in the rotated state is not physically present because it corresponds to a linearly polarized photon, which is not considered in the circular polarization analysis. \n\nTherefore, our earlier result of the ratio being tan⁴(θ/2) is correct. \n\nThus, the answer is tan⁴(θ/2), which can be written as \\boxed{\\tan^4(\\theta/2)}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ratio of the probabilities is \\boxed{\\tan^4(\\theta/2)}.\n</think>"}
