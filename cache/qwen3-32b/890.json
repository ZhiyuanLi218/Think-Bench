The given potential is Φ(z) = q / [4πε₀√(R² + z²)]. And I need to expand this in a Taylor series around z = 0 up to the lowest non-zero power of z. The options are given, so maybe after expanding I can match it with one of them.\n\nFirst, let me recall the Taylor expansion formula provided: (1 + x)^ε ≈ 1 + εx + (1/2)ε(ε - 1)x² when |x| << 1. Since z is much smaller than R, I can consider terms where z/R is small. Let me try to rewrite the given expression in terms of (z/R) to apply the expansion.\n\nStarting with Φ(z) = q / [4πε₀√(R² + z²)]. Let me factor out R² from the square root:\n\nΦ(z) = q / [4πε₀√(R²(1 + (z²/R²)))] = q / [4πε₀R√(1 + (z²/R²))].\n\nSo now it's Φ(z) = [q / 4πε₀R] * [1 / √(1 + (z²/R²))].\n\nNow, the term 1 / √(1 + x) can be written as (1 + x)^(-1/2). Let me set x = z²/R², which is small since z << R. Then applying the Taylor expansion formula given:\n\n(1 + x)^ε ≈ 1 + εx + (1/2)ε(ε - 1)x². Here, ε = -1/2. Let me compute this expansion up to the necessary terms.\n\nFirst, compute up to x² term since x is already small (z²/R²), so higher powers will be negligible. Let me write:\n\n(1 + x)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + (-1/2)x + (1/2)(-1/2)(-1/2 - 1)x².\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The expansion is 1 + εx + [ε(ε - 1)/2!]x² + ... So for ε = -1/2:\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: (-1/2)x\n\nThird term: [(-1/2)(-1/2 - 1)/2]x². Let me compute that:\n\n-1/2 - 1 = -3/2. So numerator is (-1/2)(-3/2) = 3/4. Then divide by 2! which is 2. So 3/4 divided by 2 is 3/8. Therefore, third term is (3/8)x².\n\nTherefore, overall:\n\n(1 + x)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 - (1/2)x + (3/8)x².\n\nSubstituting back x = z²/R²:\n\n≈ 1 - (1/2)(z²/R²) + (3/8)(z^4/R^4).\n\nBut since z << R, z^4/R^4 is much smaller than z²/R², so maybe for the lowest non-zero power, we can stop at the second term? Wait, the question says \"to the lowest non-zero power of z\". Wait, but the original function is even in z, so the expansion will have only even powers. The first term is 1, then - (1/2)(z²/R²), then + (3/8)(z^4/R^4), etc. So if we are to take the expansion up to the lowest non-zero power... Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. But since z is small, and we need the expansion to the lowest non-zero power. Wait, the potential at z=0 is Φ(0) = q/(4πε₀R). If we expand Φ(z) around z=0, the leading term is constant (independent of z), then the next term is quadratic in z. Since it's a minimum or maximum at z=0? Depending on the charge distribution.\n\nBut the question says \"to the lowest non-zero power of z\". Wait, maybe they want the expansion up to the first non-zero term after the leading term? Because the leading term is order z^0, then the next term is z². Since z is small, the leading term is the dominant one, but if we are to approximate Φ(z) for small z, we need to include the first correction term. So maybe they want up to z² term?\n\nBut in the expansion above, we have 1 - (1/2)(z²/R²) + ... So multiplying by [q / 4πε₀R], we get:\n\nΦ(z) ≈ [q / 4πε₀R] [1 - (z²)/(2R²) + ... ].\n\nLooking at the options, let's check:\n\nOption D is [q / 4πε₀R](1 - z²/(2R²)), which matches this. Option B is [q / 4πε₀R](1 - z²/(4R²)), which has a coefficient 1/4 instead of 1/2. Let me check my calculation again to see if I made a mistake.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nΦ(z) = [q / 4πε₀R] * [1 / sqrt(1 + (z²/R²))]\n\nLet me write 1 / sqrt(1 + ε) ≈ 1 - (1/2)ε + (3/8)ε² - ... where ε = z²/R².\n\nTherefore, Φ(z) ≈ [q / 4πε₀R][1 - (1/2)(z²/R²) + ...]. So that would be [q / 4πε₀R] - [q / 4πε₀R](1/2)(z²/R²) + ... So the coefficient of z² is -1/(2R²). Therefore, Φ(z) ≈ [q / 4πε₀R][1 - z²/(2R²)], which is exactly option D.\n\nBut let me check the other options. Option B has 1/(4R²). Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion?\n\nWait, let me re-derive the expansion. Let me recall that for (1 + x)^n, the expansion is 1 + nx + n(n-1)x²/2 + ... So for n = -1/2, x = z²/R².\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: (-1/2)x\n\nThird term: (-1/2)(-1/2 - 1)x² / 2?\n\nWait, no. Wait the general formula is:\n\n(1 + x)^n = 1 + n x + [n(n - 1)/2!] x² + [n(n - 1)(n - 2)/3!]x³ + ...\n\nSo for n = -1/2,\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: (-1/2)x\n\nThird term: [(-1/2)(-1/2 - 1)/2]x² = [(-1/2)(-3/2)/2]x² = [(3/4)/2]x² = 3/8 x². Which is what I had before. So the expansion is 1 - (1/2)x + (3/8)x² - ... So substituting x = z²/R²:\n\n1 - (1/2)(z²/R²) + (3/8)(z^4/R^4) - ... Therefore, up to the z² term, it is 1 - z²/(2R²). Therefore, multiplying by [q / 4πε₀R], Φ(z) ≈ [q / 4πε₀R][1 - z²/(2R²)], which is option D. So why is there an option B?\n\nWait, let me check if the original expression was correct. The problem says the ring is a hollow toroid of thickness 2a << R. But the given expression for Φ(z) is the same as for a thin ring (a → 0). However, the question says to calculate Φ(z) assuming z << R. But since 2a << R, maybe the given formula is already considering the thickness? Wait, but the problem says \"the electrostatic potential Φ(z) along the axis of the ring at a z distance from its center is Φ(z)=...\" So they give us the formula, so we don't have to worry about the toroid thickness? The problem says to use that formula and expand it for z << R. So maybe the given formula is correct even for a thick ring? Or perhaps the thickness is negligible because 2a << R, so it's approximated as a thin ring. Anyway, the formula given is Φ(z)= q / [4πε₀√(R² + z²)], which is the same as the potential on the axis of a thin ring of charge. Therefore, proceeding with that.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct, leading to option D. Let me check the options again:\n\nA: [q/(4πε₀)](1 - z²/(2R³)) – units don't seem to match. Because potential should have units of [charge]/[length], so if you have q/(4πε₀) times something with 1/R³, that would be [charge]/[permittivity][1/R³]. Wait, original Φ(z) is [q]/[4πε₀√(R² + z²)], so units are [q]/([permittivity][length]). So option A has [q/(4πε₀)] times (1 - z²/R³). The term z²/R³ would have units of 1/length, so overall units would be [q]/([permittivity][length])? Wait, z²/R³ is (L² / L³) = 1/L. So multiplying by q/(4πε₀) which has units [C]/([C²/(N·m²)]) = [N·m²/C]. Wait, maybe I shouldn't get bogged down with units. But option D has [q/(4πε₀ R)] times dimensionless, so that's correct. So A has an extra 1/R compared to D? Wait, no. Let me think. Original Φ(z) has units of volts. q/(4πε₀) has units of volts·meters, because electric potential due to a point charge is q/(4πε₀ r), so q/(4πε₀) is volts·meters. Therefore, if you have option A: [volts·meters] times (dimensionless - z²/R³). But z²/R³ has units of 1/meter, so the term in the parenthesis is dimensionally inconsistent. The first term is dimensionless, the second term has units 1/m. Therefore, option A is invalid because of inconsistent units. Therefore, A is wrong. Similarly, options B, C, D have [q/(4πε₀ R)] which is volts·meters / meters = volts, which is correct. So A is out.\n\nNow between B, C, D. Let me check the coefficients again. The expansion gives us [q/(4πε₀ R)] [1 - z²/(2 R²) + ...]. So that is option D. Option B has 1 - z²/(4 R²). Where could the 1/4 come from? Maybe if someone thought that the expansion was for (1 + x)^{-1/2} ≈ 1 - x/4 or something? But no, the expansion is 1 - (1/2)x + ... So unless there is a miscalculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial expression?\n\nOriginal Φ(z) = q / [4πε₀ sqrt(R² + z²)].\n\nBut if the ring has a thickness 2a << R, does that affect the potential? The problem says that the given Φ(z) is already the potential. So we don't need to adjust it. The question is just to expand the given Φ(z) for z << R. So my calculation seems right. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nBut let me check once again. Let me compute Φ(z) ≈ [q / 4πε₀ R] [1 - (1/2)(z²/R²)].\n\nYes. Therefore, Φ(z) ≈ [q / 4πε₀ R] - [q / 4πε₀ R³] * z² / 2. But the first term is [q / 4πε₀ R], and the second term is subtracted. So written as [q / 4πε₀ R] (1 - z²/(2 R²)), which is option D. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another approach. For example, considering the potential on the axis of a ring. For a thin ring, the potential at a point on the axis is indeed Φ(z) = [q / 4πε₀] / sqrt(R² + z²). For small z, we can expand this as I did. Alternatively, think about multipole expansion. The ring has a certain charge distribution. The monopole term is just the total charge over 4πε₀ r, but here r is not the distance from the center but from each element. Wait, but on the axis, the monopole term would dominate, but since it's a ring, maybe there is a dipole term? No, because the ring is symmetric, so dipole moment is zero. The next term is quadrupole. But for z << R, maybe the expansion can be considered. Wait, but if we are expanding for z << R, then maybe the potential can be written as Φ(z) ≈ Φ(0) + (1/2) Φ''(0) z² + ... since the first derivative Φ'(0) is zero due to symmetry.\n\nSo let's compute Φ''(0). Given Φ(z) = [q / 4πε₀] (R² + z²)^{-1/2}.\n\nFirst derivative: Φ’(z) = [q / 4πε₀] * (-1/2) * 2z * (R² + z²)^{-3/2} = - [q z / 4πε₀] (R² + z²)^{-3/2}\n\nSecond derivative: Φ''(z) = - [q / 4πε₀] [ (R² + z²)^{-3/2} + (-3/2)*2z^2*(R² + z²)^{-5/2} ] ?\n\nWait, let me compute it properly. Let me denote f(z) = (R² + z²)^{-1/2}\n\nThen f’(z) = - (1/2)(2z)(R² + z²)^{-3/2} = - z (R² + z²)^{-3/2}\n\nThen f''(z) = - [ (R² + z²)^{-3/2} + (-3/2)(2z)(z)(R² + z²)^{-5/2} ]\n\nWait:\n\nUsing product rule: derivative of -z * (R² + z²)^{-3/2} is:\n\n- [ (R² + z²)^{-3/2} + (-3/2)(2z²)(R² + z²)^{-5/2} ] ?\n\nWait:\n\nLet me compute d/dz [ -z (R² + z²)^{-3/2} ]:\n\n= - [ (R² + z²)^{-3/2} + z * d/dz (R² + z²)^{-3/2} ]\n\n= - [ (R² + z²)^{-3/2} + z * (-3/2)(2z)(R² + z²)^{-5/2} ]\n\n= - [ (R² + z²)^{-3/2} - 3 z² (R² + z²)^{-5/2} ]\n\n= - (R² + z²)^{-5/2} [ (R² + z²) - 3 z² ]\n\n= - (R² + z²)^{-5/2} [ R² - 2 z² ]\n\nTherefore, Φ''(z) = [q / 4πε₀] * f''(z) ?\n\nWait no: Φ(z) = [q / 4πε₀] f(z), so Φ''(z) = [q / 4πε₀] f''(z). Therefore, evaluating at z=0:\n\nΦ''(0) = [q / 4πε₀] * [ - (R² + 0)^{-5/2} (R² - 0) ] = [q / 4πε₀] * [ - R² / R^5 ] = [q / 4πε₀] * [ -1 / R³ ]\n\nTherefore, the expansion Φ(z) ≈ Φ(0) + (1/2) Φ''(0) z² + ... \n\nΦ(0) = [q / 4πε₀] * 1/R\n\n(1/2) Φ''(0) z² = (1/2) [ - q / (4πε₀ R³) ] z² = - q z² / (8 π ε₀ R³ )\n\nWait, but according to our previous expansion using Taylor series, we had Φ(z) ≈ [q / 4πε₀ R] [1 - z²/(2 R²) ] = q / (4 π ε₀ R) - q z² / (8 π ε₀ R³). Which matches with this result. Therefore, the expansion is correct. Therefore, the answer is option D: [q / 4πε₀ R] (1 - z²/(2 R²)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
