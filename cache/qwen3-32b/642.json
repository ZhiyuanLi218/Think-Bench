Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that the gcd of two numbers also divides their linear combinations. So maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here? The Euclidean algorithm is a method to find the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. Let me recall how that works. \n\nThe Euclidean algorithm says that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b). So if I apply that here, let me let a = 2n + 1 and b = n + 7. Then, gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) would be equal to gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) mod (n + 7)). Let me compute (2n + 1) mod (n + 7). \n\nTo compute that, I can divide 2n + 1 by n + 7. Let me see, how many times does n + 7 go into 2n + 1? Well, if I multiply n + 7 by 2, I get 2n + 14. But 2n + 1 is less than that. So the quotient is 1? Let me check:\n\nIf I take (n + 7) * 1 = n + 7. Then subtract that from 2n + 1: (2n + 1) - (n + 7) = n - 6. So the remainder is n - 6. Therefore, gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, n - 6). \n\nOkay, so now I can apply the Euclidean algorithm again to n + 7 and n - 6. Let me set a = n + 7 and b = n - 6. Then, gcd(a, b) = gcd(n - 6, (n + 7) mod (n - 6)). Let me compute (n + 7) mod (n - 6). \n\nAgain, divide n + 7 by n - 6. The quotient is 1, since (n - 6)*1 = n - 6. Subtract that from n + 7: (n + 7) - (n - 6) = 13. So the remainder is 13. Therefore, gcd(n + 7, n - 6) = gcd(n - 6, 13). \n\nSo now we have that the original gcd is equal to gcd(n - 6, 13). Since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can only be 1 or 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13, provided that 13 divides n - 6. \n\nBut we need to make sure that such n exists. Let me check. If 13 divides n - 6, then n - 6 = 13k for some integer k ≥ 1 (since n is positive). Therefore, n = 13k + 6. Let me pick k = 1, then n = 13 + 6 = 19. Let me compute gcd(19 + 7, 2*19 + 1) = gcd(26, 39). What's gcd(26, 39)? Well, 26 divides into 39 once with remainder 13, and then gcd(26,13) is 13. So yes, gcd is 13. \n\nIs there a possibility of a higher gcd? Well, since we arrived at gcd(n - 6, 13), and 13 is prime, the maximum possible gcd is 13. Unless there's a mistake in my reasoning... Let me check again.\n\nStarting with gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1). Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\ngcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7)) = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1 - 2n -14) = gcd(n + 7, -13). But gcd is always non-negative, so that's gcd(n + 7, 13). Wait, hold on! Wait, in my previous steps I had arrived at gcd(n - 6, 13), but here I have gcd(n + 7, 13). Which is it?\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check my steps again. \n\nFirst step: gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7)) = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1 - 2n - 14) = gcd(n + 7, -13) = gcd(n + 7, 13). \n\nBut earlier, I had gone through another step where I thought it was gcd(n - 6, 13). Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me redo the steps carefully. \n\nFirst, gcd(2n + 1, n + 7). \n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a - q*b). So let me take a = 2n + 1, b = n + 7. Then, we can write 2n + 1 = 2*(n + 7) - 13. Because 2*(n + 7) is 2n + 14, so 2n + 1 = 2n + 14 - 13, so yes. Therefore, gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, -13) = gcd(n + 7, 13). \n\nWait, so my previous step where I did two steps of the Euclidean algorithm was incorrect? Because in my first approach, I did:\n\ngcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, n - 6) then gcd(n - 6, 13). But according to this, it's directly gcd(n + 7, 13). Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check with n = 19. If n = 19, then n + 7 = 26, 2n + 1 = 39. gcd(26, 39) is 13. According to the first approach, gcd(n + 7, 13) would be gcd(26, 13) = 13. According to the second approach, if I had done two steps, then gcd(n - 6, 13) where n - 6 is 13, so gcd(13, 13) is 13. So both approaches give the same answer here. \n\nWait, so how come in my first approach, I had gcd(n - 6, 13) and in the second approach, gcd(n + 7, 13). But they must be equivalent? Because n + 7 and n - 6 differ by 13. So if d divides both n + 7 and 13, then since n - 6 = (n + 7) - 13, so d divides n - 6 as well. Therefore, gcd(n + 7, 13) = gcd(n - 6, 13). Because 13 is the same. \n\nTherefore, both approaches are correct. So whether you do one step or two steps of the Euclidean algorithm, you get the same result. Therefore, the gcd is equal to gcd(13, n + 7). Therefore, the maximum possible value is 13, when 13 divides n + 7. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was when 13 divides n - 6, but if it's when 13 divides n + 7, then n + 7 = 13k. Let me check with n + 7 = 13. Then n = 6. Let me compute gcd(6 + 7, 2*6 + 1) = gcd(13, 13) = 13. So that works. \n\nBut in my previous example, n = 19, which is n = 13*1 + 6, which would be n + 7 = 26 = 13*2, so yes, n + 7 is 13k. Therefore, both conditions are equivalent. Because n + 7 ≡ 0 mod 13 => n ≡ -7 mod 13 => n ≡ 6 mod 13 (since -7 + 13 = 6). Therefore, n - 6 ≡ 0 mod 13. Therefore, both conditions are equivalent. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the conclusion is that the gcd is 13 if 13 divides n + 7 (or n - 6), otherwise 1. Therefore, the greatest possible value is 13. \n\nBut let me check another example. Suppose n = 6, then gcd(6 + 7, 12 + 1) = gcd(13, 13) = 13. If n = 19, as before, gcd(26, 39) = 13. If n = 13k - 7, then n + 7 = 13k, so gcd(13k, 2*(13k - 7) + 1) = gcd(13k, 26k - 14 + 1) = gcd(13k, 26k - 13) = gcd(13k, 26k -13 - 2k*13) = Wait, maybe simpler: 26k -13 = 13*(2k - 1). Therefore, gcd(13k, 13*(2k - 1)) = 13 * gcd(k, 2k - 1). Since gcd(k, 2k - 1) = gcd(k, 1) = 1. Therefore, the gcd is 13*1 = 13. Therefore, regardless of k, as long as n is chosen so that n + 7 is a multiple of 13, the gcd is 13. Therefore, 13 is attainable. \n\nIs there a possibility of a higher gcd? Since 13 is prime, unless there is some other common divisor. But according to our derivation, the gcd is either 1 or 13. Therefore, 13 is the maximum. \n\nWait, but let me check if there is a case where gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) is greater than 13. Suppose, for example, that there exists a number d > 13 that divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1. Then d divides 2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7) = -13. Therefore, d divides 13. But since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, there cannot be a d > 13. Therefore, 13 is indeed the maximum. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value is 13. \n\nBut let me just check with another example. Let me take n = 20. Then n + 7 = 27, 2n + 1 = 41. gcd(27, 41) is 1, since 41 is prime. If n = 13, then n + 7 = 20, 2n + 1 = 27, gcd(20, 27) is 1. If n = 26, n + 7 = 33, 2n + 1 = 53. gcd(33, 53) is 1. If n = 20, as above. Hmm. If n = 6, as before, gcd(13, 13) is 13. If n = 19, gcd(26, 39) is 13. If n = 6 + 13 = 19, which we did. n = 6 + 26 = 32. Let me check n = 32. n + 7 = 39, 2n + 1 = 65. gcd(39, 65). Well, 39 divides into 65 once with remainder 26. Then gcd(39, 26). Which is 13. So yes, gcd is 13. \n\nSo seems like whenever n ≡ 6 mod 13, the gcd is 13, otherwise 1. Therefore, 13 is the maximum. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 13. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}.\n</think>"}
