The problem involves a photon colliding elastically with a particle of mass m that's initially at rest in the lab frame. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in relativistic collisions, especially involving photons and particles, energy and momentum conservation are key. Since the collision is elastic, both energy and momentum should be conserved. However, since we are dealing with finding the velocity of the COM frame, maybe I don't need to go through the entire collision process. Instead, maybe I can just compute the COM velocity based on the initial conditions before the collision?\n\nThe COM frame is the frame where the total momentum is zero. So, if I can calculate the total momentum in the lab frame, then find the velocity at which the total momentum becomes zero when transforming to the COM frame, that should give me β.\n\nLet me recall the formula for transforming momentum between frames. If we have a velocity boost of β (as a fraction of c) from frame R to R', then the momentum transforms according to the Lorentz transformation. But maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, the velocity of the COM frame can be found by considering the total energy and momentum of the system.\n\nI remember that in special relativity, the velocity of the COM frame (also called the center-of-momentum frame) can be found using the total energy and the total momentum. Specifically, the velocity β is given by the ratio of the total momentum times c squared over the total energy. Let me check that.\n\nThe formula is something like:\n\nβ = (P_total * c) / E_total\n\nBut let me make sure. In relativity, the momentum 4-vector has components (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). The velocity of the COM frame is such that the spatial components of the total momentum are zero. Therefore, if we have a system with total energy E and total momentum P, then the velocity of the COM frame relative to the lab frame would be β = (P c²)/E. Yes, that seems right because if you consider the Lorentz factor γ for the COM frame, then γ(β) * (E - β P c²) = E_com, but since in COM frame, the momentum is zero, maybe there's a relation here. Alternatively, think of β as the ratio of the spatial part over the temporal part of the 4-momentum. So if you have the total 4-momentum (E/c, P), then the velocity of the COM frame is β = (c² P · β) / E? Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the velocity of the COM frame is such that the total momentum is zero. So if we boost from the lab frame to the COM frame with velocity β, then the total momentum in the COM frame is zero. The transformation of momentum under a boost is given by:\n\np' = γ(p - β E / c²)\n\nWhere p is the original momentum, E is the original energy, and γ is the Lorentz factor. Since in the COM frame, the total momentum p' is zero, we have:\n\n0 = γ(P_total - β E_total / c²)\n\nWhich implies:\n\nP_total - β E_total / c² = 0 => β = (P_total c²) / E_total\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, β = (P_total * c²) / E_total.\n\nSo I need to compute the total momentum P_total and the total energy E_total in the lab frame before the collision, then plug them into this formula.\n\nLet me compute these quantities. In the lab frame, before the collision, the photon is moving along the Oz direction (which I assume is the z-axis), and the particle is at rest.\n\nFirst, let's compute the total energy E_total. The total energy is the sum of the photon's energy and the particle's energy. The photon has energy E_photon = hν. The particle is at rest, so its energy is E_particle = m c². Therefore, E_total = hν + m c².\n\nNow, the total momentum P_total. Since the photon is moving along the z-axis, its momentum is along z. The particle is at rest, so its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum is just the momentum of the photon. The momentum of a photon is given by p_photon = E_photon / c = hν / c. Therefore, P_total = hν / c (in the z-direction). Since we're interested in the magnitude for β, we can just take the magnitude.\n\nTherefore, β = (P_total * c²) / E_total = [ (hν / c) * c² ] / (hν + m c² ) = (hν * c ) / (hν + m c² )\n\nNow, the problem defines α = hν / (m c²), so let's substitute that in.\n\nLet me write hν = α m c². Therefore:\n\nβ = ( α m c² * c ) / ( α m c² + m c² ) = ( α m c³ ) / [ m c² ( α + 1 ) ] ) = ( α c ) / ( α + 1 )\n\nWait, but β is supposed to be dimensionless (since it's v/c). Wait, hold on. Wait, let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, β is (P_total * c²)/E_total.\n\nP_total is hν / c. So multiplying by c² gives hν * c.\n\nThen E_total is hν + m c².\n\nTherefore, β = (hν * c) / (hν + m c² )\n\nYes. Then substituting hν = α m c²:\n\nβ = ( α m c² * c ) / ( α m c² + m c² ) = α c³ m / [ m c² ( α + 1 ) ] ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait numerator is hν * c = α m c² * c = α m c³\n\nDenominator is hν + m c² = α m c² + m c² = m c² ( α + 1 )\n\nTherefore β = ( α m c³ ) / [ m c² ( α + 1 ) ] ) = α c / ( α + 1 )\n\nBut β is v / c, so v = β c. Wait, but according to this, β is α c / ( α + 1 ), so β (which is v/c) is α / (1 + α). Therefore, β = α / (1 + α). Therefore, β is α divided by (1 + α). Then looking at the options, option C is α × 1/(1 + α). So option C.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"v = β c\", so β is v/c, and according to my calculation β is [ α c ] / (1 + α ), so β = α / (1 + α ). So yes, option C is α/(1 + α ). Therefore, answer is C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there is any mistake here. Because sometimes when dealing with relativistic velocities and COM frames, there might be some factors I missed.\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula β = (P_total c²)/E_total. Is this correct?\n\nYes, because in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero. So if you have a system with energy E and momentum P in another frame, then the velocity of the COM frame is given by β = (P c²)/E. Let me check with a simple case. For example, if you have a particle at rest, then P=0, so β=0, which is correct. If you have a photon and a particle, then?\n\nAlternatively, think of the velocity of the COM frame as the velocity such that the total momentum is zero. So, in the lab frame, the photon has momentum p_photon = hν / c, and the particle has momentum zero. Then, if we move to a frame moving with velocity β along the z-axis, then the momenta of both the photon and the particle will change.\n\nBut maybe I can think of it as the velocity where the momentum of the particle plus the momentum of the photon equals zero.\n\nBut since the particle is massive and the photon is massless, this requires some calculation.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the formula for β that I derived earlier. Let me check with some known case. Suppose α is very small, so the photon energy is much smaller than m c². Then β ≈ α / 1, so β ≈ α. Since α = hν/(m c²), which is small. So the COM frame is moving with a velocity proportional to the photon's momentum divided by the particle's mass. Which makes sense, because if you have a low-energy photon hitting a particle, the COM frame is moving with velocity approximately equal to the initial velocity of the particle if it were classical. But since the photon's momentum is p = hν / c, and the particle's mass is m, then the velocity of COM would be p / (m + something). Wait, in classical mechanics, if you have a particle of mass m at rest and another particle of mass m_photon? But photon has zero mass. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the photon's energy as equivalent to some effective mass? Not sure. But in the non-relativistic limit, if the photon's energy is very small, so α << 1, then β ≈ α. Let's see what α is. α = hν/(m c²). The photon's momentum is p = hν / c. So β ≈ p / m. Which would be like the velocity if the particle m were to absorb the photon's momentum. But since it's elastic collision, maybe not exactly, but in the non-relativistic case, if a particle of mass m is hit by another particle with momentum p, then the COM velocity is p/(m + m_photon). But since photon's mass is zero, it's p/m. So this seems to agree. Therefore, in the non-relativistic limit, β ≈ p/m c? Wait, no, β is dimensionless. Wait, p is hν / c, so p/mc would be (hν / c) / (m c) ) = α / c² * m c² / (m c²) ? Wait, no. Wait, p/m is (hν / c)/m = (α m c²)/ (m c) ) = α c / 1. Therefore, p/m = α c. Therefore, β ≈ p/(m c) * c? Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, in classical mechanics, if you have a particle of mass m at rest, and another particle of mass m' moving with velocity u, then the COM velocity is (m' u)/(m + m'). In our case, the photon has energy E = hν, which in classical terms if we tried to assign it a mass would be m_photon = E / c² = hν / c². But the photon's momentum is p = E / c. So if we tried to think classically, maybe the COM velocity would be (m_photon * c) / (m + m_photon). Wait, because the photon's velocity is c. So (m_photon * c) / (m + m_photon) = [ (hν / c² ) * c ] / [ m + hν / c² ] = (hν / c ) / [ m + hν / c² ] = [ α m c² / c ] / [ m + α m c² / c² ] = α m c / [ m ( 1 + α ) ] = α c / (1 + α ). Therefore, β = α c / (1 + α ), so since β = v / c, then v / c = α c / (1 + α ) => v = α c² / (1 + α ). Wait, but here I was trying to think classically, but arrived at β = α / (1 + α ). Which matches our previous result. Therefore, in the classical case, this formula would hold. Therefore, this gives me more confidence that β = α / (1 + α ). Therefore, option C.\n\nBut let me check another extreme. Suppose α approaches 1. Then β approaches 1 / 2. If α approaches infinity, meaning the photon energy is very large compared to m c², then β approaches α / α = 1. Which makes sense, because if the photon has huge energy, then the COM frame is moving at almost the speed of light, same as the photon. But since the photon has energy and momentum, and the particle is at rest, when the photon's energy is very large, the COM frame should be moving at a speed close to c. But according to β = α / (1 + α ), when α approaches infinity, β approaches 1, which is correct. So that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the case when α approaches 1, β approaches 1/2. Let's see. Suppose hν = m c². Then the photon has energy equal to the rest energy of the particle. Then the COM frame should be moving at β = 1/2? Let me think.\n\nLet me compute total energy and total momentum. Total energy is hν + m c² = m c² + m c² = 2 m c². Total momentum is hν / c = m c² / c = m c. Then β = (P_total c²)/E_total = (m c * c² ) / (2 m c² ) = c³ / 2 c² = c / 2. Therefore, β is (c/2)/c = 1/2. So β = 1/2. Which matches. Therefore, yes, when α = 1, β = 1/2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is option C: α × 1/(1 + α).\n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\nA: α × 1/(1 - α)\n\nB: α × 1/sqrt(1 + α)\n\nC: α × 1/(1 + α)\n\nD: α × 1/sqrt(1 - α)\n\nYes, option C is the one we derived. So the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me think if there is any relativistic effect I might have missed. For example, when calculating the total energy and momentum, did I account for relativistic expressions correctly?\n\nThe particle is at rest, so its energy is indeed m c², and its momentum is zero. The photon's energy is hν and its momentum is hν / c. These are correct. Therefore, total energy and momentum are correctly calculated. Then using β = (P_total c²)/E_total is the correct formula for the velocity of the COM frame. So I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the COM velocity by equating the momentum of the particle and the photon in the COM frame. Wait, but in the COM frame, total momentum is zero. Therefore, the magnitude of the particle's momentum must equal the magnitude of the photon's momentum. Let me try this approach.\n\nLet me denote the COM frame moving at velocity v (β c) relative to the lab frame. In the lab frame, before collision, the particle is at rest, and the photon is moving at speed c. In the COM frame, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momentum of the particle and the photon must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nLet me compute the momentum of the particle and the photon in the COM frame.\n\nFirst, the velocity of the COM frame is β c along the z-axis. Let's compute the momentum of the particle in the COM frame. The particle is at rest in the lab frame. To find its momentum in the COM frame, which is moving at velocity -β c relative to the lab frame (since COM is moving at β c in lab frame, so lab is moving at -β c in COM frame). Therefore, we need to apply a Lorentz boost to the particle's momentum.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum when boosting from lab frame to COM frame (which is moving at velocity -β c relative to lab frame, i.e., velocity β c in the positive z-direction in lab frame). Wait, this might get complicated, but let me try.\n\nThe particle is at rest in lab frame, so its energy is E_p = m c², and its momentum is p_p = 0.\n\nTo find its energy and momentum in the COM frame, which is moving at velocity β c along z-axis relative to lab frame, we can use the Lorentz transformation:\n\nE' = γ (E - β c p_z )\n\np'_z = γ (p_z - β E / c² )\n\nSince the particle's p_z is zero, we have:\n\nE'_p = γ (m c² - β c * 0 ) = γ m c²\n\np'_p_z = γ (0 - β m c² / c² ) = - γ β m\n\nSimilarly, for the photon, which is moving along z-axis in lab frame with energy E_γ = hν and momentum p_γ = hν / c.\n\nIts energy and momentum in COM frame:\n\nE'_γ = γ (E_γ - β c p_γ )\n\np'_γ_z = γ (p_γ - β E_γ / c² )\n\nLet me compute these:\n\nE'_γ = γ (hν - β c * hν / c ) = γ hν (1 - β )\n\np'_γ_z = γ ( hν / c - β hν / c² ) = γ hν / c ( 1 - β )\n\nWait, interesting. So both the energy and momentum of the photon in the COM frame are scaled by γ (1 - β ). But since for a photon, E = c |p|, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero. Therefore:\n\np'_p_z + p'_γ_z = 0\n\nSo:\n\n- γ β m + γ hν / c (1 - β ) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by γ:\n\n- β m + hν / c (1 - β ) = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\nhν / c (1 - β ) = β m\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\nhν (1 - β ) = β m c\n\nNow, solve for β.\n\nLet me recall that α = hν / (m c² ). Therefore, hν = α m c². Substitute into the equation:\n\nα m c² (1 - β ) = β m c\n\nDivide both sides by m c:\n\nα c (1 - β ) = β\n\nExpand:\n\nα c - α c β = β\n\nBring all terms with β to one side:\n\nα c = β + α c β = β (1 + α c )\n\nWait, hold on, here I might have made a mistake. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal equation after dividing by m c:\n\nα c (1 - β ) = β\n\nExpanding left side:\n\nα c - α c β = β\n\nNow, bringing terms with β to the right:\n\nα c = β + α c β = β (1 + α c )\n\nWait, but here I have β (1 + α c ). Wait, but α is hν/(m c² ). So α c is (hν c )/(m c² ) = hν/(m c ). Which is dimensionless? Wait, hν has units of energy, m c has units of energy (since m c² is energy, so m c is energy / c). Therefore, hν/(m c ) has units of (energy) / (energy / c ) ) = c. Therefore, α c has units of c? Wait, but α is dimensionless? Wait:\n\nWait α is defined as hν/(m c² ), which is dimensionless. Then α c is dimensionless multiplied by c, so it has dimensions of velocity. Therefore, in the equation above, we have:\n\nα c = β (1 + α c )\n\nBut β is dimensionless (since it is v/c). Wait, but α c has dimensions of velocity. Therefore, this equation seems dimensionally inconsistent. There must be a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the previous steps again. Starting from:\n\nAfter dividing by m c:\n\nα c (1 - β ) = β\n\nWait, let me check the units here. Let me recall:\n\nOriginal equation after dividing by m c:\n\nLeft side: [hν / (m c ) ] * c * (1 - β )\n\nWait, hν/(m c ) is [energy]/[mass * velocity] = [mass * velocity²]/[mass * velocity] = velocity. Then multiplied by c gives velocity². Wait, but I think I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait let me do this carefully. Let me retrace.\n\nWe had:\n\nhν (1 - β ) = β m c\n\nThen I substituted hν = α m c²:\n\nα m c² (1 - β ) = β m c\n\nDivide both sides by m c:\n\nα c (1 - β ) = β\n\nYes, that's correct. Now α is dimensionless, c is velocity, so left side is velocity * (dimensionless), right side is dimensionless * velocity? Wait β is dimensionless, so right side is β, which is dimensionless? Wait no, no. Wait β is dimensionless, but the equation is α c (1 - β ) = β. Wait, left side is velocity times (dimensionless), right side is dimensionless? That can't be. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Which suggests that my earlier derivation is wrong. But where?\n\nWait, let's check the equation:\n\nFrom the momentum condition in COM frame:\n\n- β m + hν / c (1 - β ) = 0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait earlier I had:\n\nAfter Lorentz transforming, the momentum of the particle is - γ β m, and the momentum of the photon is γ hν / c (1 - β ). Then setting their sum to zero:\n\n- γ β m + γ hν / c (1 - β ) = 0 => -β m + hν / c (1 - β ) = 0.\n\nBut this seems to have units inconsistency. Let me check units:\n\nβ is dimensionless, m has units of mass, hν / c has units of (energy / velocity) = (mass * velocity² ) / velocity = mass * velocity. Therefore, the term hν / c (1 - β ) has units of mass * velocity. The term β m has units of mass. Therefore, equating -β m + ... = 0 would have inconsistent units. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.\n\nAh! Here's the problem. When I applied the Lorentz transformation to the particle's momentum, I think I forgot that the Lorentz transformation equations involve dividing by c² in some terms. Let me check the Lorentz transformation formulas again.\n\nThe correct Lorentz transformation for momentum when boosting along the z-axis is:\n\np'_z = γ (p_z - (β E ) / c² )\n\nAnd energy transforms as:\n\nE' = γ (E - β c p_z )\n\nSo for the particle, which has p_z = 0 and E = m c², then p'_z = γ (0 - β m c² / c² ) = - γ β m. So p'_z has units of mass * velocity? Wait γ is dimensionless, β is dimensionless, m is mass. So p'_z has units of mass. But momentum should have units of mass * velocity. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Wait, no:\n\nWait E is in energy units, which is mass * velocity². Therefore, β c p_z has units of (dimensionless) * velocity * (mass * velocity) )? Wait no:\n\nWait p_z has units of mass * velocity. β is dimensionless. c has units of velocity. Therefore, β c p_z has units of velocity * mass * velocity = mass * velocity², same as E. Therefore, the term (β c p_z ) is okay in the energy transformation. But for the momentum transformation, the term is (β E / c² ). Let me check units:\n\nβ is dimensionless, E has units of mass * velocity², c² has units of velocity². Therefore, β E / c² has units of (mass * velocity² ) / velocity² = mass. Therefore, p_z - β E / c² has units of mass * velocity - mass = inconsistent units? Wait no, p_z has units of mass * velocity, and β E / c² has units of mass. So unless there is a velocity factor missing. Therefore, there must be an error in my application of the Lorentz transformation.\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is p'_z = γ (p_z - (β / c² ) E ). Let me check the standard Lorentz transformation for momentum. According to standard references, the Lorentz transformation for momentum is:\n\nIf you have a boost with velocity v along the z-axis, then:\n\np'_z = γ (p_z - v E / c² )\n\nE' = γ (E - v p_z c² )\n\nWait no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the correct formula.\n\nActually, according to the Lorentz transformation for momentum and energy, if you have a boost with velocity v in the z-direction, then:\n\np'_z = γ (p_z - (v / c² ) E )\n\nE' = γ (E - v p_z c )\n\nWait, let me check dimensions again. For p'_z:\n\np_z has units of mass * velocity. v / c² is dimensionless (velocity / velocity²). E has units of mass * velocity². Therefore, (v / c² ) E has units of mass * velocity² * dimensionless, which is mass * velocity². But p_z - (v / c² ) E would have units of mass * velocity - mass * velocity², which is inconsistent. Therefore, clearly something is wrong here.\n\nWait, no, the correct formula should be such that the units match. Let me check the standard Lorentz transformation for momentum.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for the momentum components when changing frames with relative velocity v along the z-axis is:\n\np'_x = γ (p_x - (v / c² ) E )\n\np'_y = γ (p_y - (v / c² ) E )\n\np'_z = γ (p_z - (v / c² ) E )\n\nWait, no, this seems to be for the transverse components. Wait no, actually, for longitudinal component, the transformation is different. Wait I need to look up the correct Lorentz transformation for momentum.\n\nActually, according to the Lorentz transformation for a boost along the z-axis, the momentum transforms as:\n\np'_z = γ (p_z - β E / c )\n\nWait no, let me recall that the Lorentz transformation for energy and momentum is:\n\nE' = γ(E - β c p_z )\n\np'_z = γ(p_z - β E / c² )\n\nYes, this is from the standard Lorentz transformations. Let me check units:\n\nFor E': γ(E - β c p_z ). E has units of energy, β c p_z has units of (dimensionless) * velocity * (mass * velocity) = mass * velocity², same as energy. Good.\n\nFor p'_z: γ(p_z - β E / c² ). p_z has units of mass * velocity. β E / c² has units of (dimensionless) * energy / velocity² = (mass * velocity² ) / velocity² = mass. Therefore, p_z - β E / c² has units of mass * velocity - mass. Which is inconsistent. Therefore, something is wrong here. Wait, no, there must be a missing velocity term. Wait, no, this is from the Lorentz transformation. Perhaps I need to express everything in terms of c?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that in natural units where c=1, the formulas look simpler, but when we restore c, they might have different appearances. Let me check a reference.\n\nAccording to the Lorentz transformation for momentum and energy, if we have a boost with velocity v along the z-axis, then:\n\nE' = γ(E - v p_z )\n\np'_z = γ(p_z - v E / c² )\n\np'_x = γ(p_x - v E x / (c² v )) ??? No, for transverse components, p'_x = p_x, p'_y = p_y when v is along z-axis? No, that's only in non-relativistic mechanics. In relativity, the transverse components do change due to the Lorentz contraction and time dilation.\n\nActually, the correct transformation is:\n\np'_x = γ(p_x - (β / (1 + γ)) p_z )\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the invariant relation between energy and momentum.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that the 4-momentum transforms as a 4-vector. The 4-momentum is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). So under a boost along z-axis with velocity v, the 4-momentum transforms according to the Lorentz transformation matrix.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation matrix for a boost along z-axis is:\n\nγ      0      0     -γβ\n\n0      1      0       0\n\n0      0      1       0\n\n-γβ    0      0      γ\n\nWait, no, the exact matrix is:\n\nFor a boost in the z-direction with velocity v, the Lorentz transformation matrix Λ is:\n\n[ γ   0   0  -γβ ]\n\n[ 0   1   0    0  ]\n\n[ 0   0   1    0  ]\n\n[-γβ 0   0   γ   ]\n\nTherefore, acting on the 4-vector (ct, x, y, z), but for momentum-energy, it's (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). Therefore, applying this matrix, we get:\n\nE'/c = γ(E/c - β p_z )\n\np'_x = p_x\n\np'_y = p_y\n\np'_z = γ(p_z - β E/c² )\n\nAh! So the transverse components remain the same? No, wait no, the second and third components are unchanged? Wait according to the matrix, if the original 4-vector is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z), then after transformation:\n\nE'/c = γ(E/c - β p_z )\n\np'_x = p_x\n\np'_y = p_y\n\np'_z = γ(p_z - β E/c² )\n\nWait, but this seems to suggest that p'_x and p'_y are the same as p_x and p_y? That can't be right, because if you boost along z-axis, the transverse momenta should change due to the Lorentz contraction. Wait, no, actually, in the standard Lorentz transformation for momentum, the transverse components do not change if the boost is along the longitudinal direction. Wait, let me think about a simple case. Suppose you have a particle moving in the x-direction, and you boost along the z-direction. The x-component of its velocity would change because of the boost? No, actually, the velocity components perpendicular to the boost direction do not change in magnitude, but the time dilation affects the momentum.\n\nWait, actually, the relativistic momentum in the transverse direction is p_x = γ m v_x. If you boost along z-axis, the v_x remains the same, but the γ changes. Therefore, the transverse momentum does change. Therefore, there must be an error in the transformation matrix I wrote above. Let me check again.\n\nActually, the correct transformation for the transverse components is:\n\np'_x = γ (p_x - β E p_x / (E + p_z c )) ? No, this is getting too complex. Let me refer to the correct formula.\n\nAccording to the Lorentz transformation for momentum, when boosting along the z-axis with velocity v, the transverse components transform as:\n\np'_x = γ (p_x - (v/c²) E )\n\nWait, no, that would be for the longitudinal component. Wait no, earlier we saw that p'_z = γ(p_z - β E / c² ). For transverse components, it's different. Actually, the correct transformation is that the transverse components of momentum transform as:\n\np'_x = p_x / γ (1 - (v/c²) p_z / γ )\n\nNo, this is too vague. Let me refer to the standard formula.\n\nActually, according to the Lorentz transformation for momentum, if you have a boost with velocity v along the z-axis, then:\n\nFor the transverse components (x and y), the momentum transforms as:\n\np'_x = p_x\n\np'_y = p_y\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Wait, let me think about velocity transformation. If a particle has velocity (u_x, u_y, u_z) in frame R, then in frame R' moving at velocity v along z-axis, the transformed velocities are:\n\nu'_x = (u_x) / γ (1 - v u_z / c² )\n\nu'_y = (u_y) / γ (1 - v u_z / c² )\n\nu'_z = (u_z - v ) / (1 - v u_z / c² )\n\nTherefore, the momentum components, which are γ_momentum * mass * velocity, will transform accordingly. Therefore, the transverse components of momentum are not simply equal to the original ones. Therefore, there must be a factor involving γ.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier application of the Lorentz transformation was incorrect by assuming p'_x = p_x and p'_y = p_y. Therefore, my previous calculation for the momentum in the COM frame was incomplete, as I only considered the z-component and neglected the changes in transverse components. However, in our case, since both the photon and the particle are moving along the z-axis initially, and we are considering a boost along the z-axis, perhaps the transverse momenta are zero and remain zero? Let me think.\n\nIn the lab frame, the particle is at rest, so its momentum is zero in all directions. The photon is moving along the z-axis, so its momentum is purely along z. After boosting along the z-axis, the transverse components of the photon's momentum would still be zero, because it's moving along the z-axis in the lab frame, and boosting along z-axis won't give it any transverse momentum. Similarly, the particle's transverse momentum is zero in lab frame, and remains zero after boosting. Therefore, in this specific case, the transverse momenta are zero in both frames, so my earlier calculation focusing only on the z-component is valid. Therefore, the equation -β m + hν / c (1 - β ) = 0 is actually correct, despite the units appearing inconsistent? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\n- γ β m + γ hν / c (1 - β ) = 0\n\nWait, no, after dividing by γ, it's:\n\n-β m + hν / c (1 - β ) = 0\n\nBut let's check units. β is dimensionless. m has units of mass. hν / c has units of energy / velocity = (mass * velocity² ) / velocity = mass * velocity. So the term hν / c (1 - β ) has units of mass * velocity. The term -β m has units of mass. Therefore, adding them together would give mass * velocity + mass, which is inconsistent. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the derivation.\n\nAh! Here's the problem: When I applied the Lorentz transformation to the particle's momentum, I think I missed a factor of c somewhere. Let me go back.\n\nThe particle's momentum in the COM frame is p'_p_z = γ (p_z - β E / c² ). In the lab frame, the particle has p_z = 0 and E = m c². Therefore:\n\np'_p_z = γ (0 - β * m c² / c² ) = - γ β m\n\nBut momentum should have units of mass * velocity. However, - γ β m has units of mass. Therefore, this suggests that there's a missing velocity factor. This indicates an error in my calculation. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, the formula is p'_z = γ (p_z - β E / c² ). Let me check the units again. β is dimensionless, E has units of mass * velocity², c² has units of velocity². Therefore, β E / c² has units of (mass * velocity² ) / velocity² = mass. Therefore, p_z - β E / c² has units of mass * velocity - mass. This is inconsistent. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the Lorentz transformation formula. But where?\n\nWait, no, the correct formula must have units consistent. Let me check the derivation of the Lorentz transformation for momentum. The Lorentz transformation for the spatial components of momentum can be derived from the transformation of velocity.\n\nIf we have a particle with velocity u in frame R, then its momentum is p = γ_u m u, where γ_u = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c² ). In frame R', moving at velocity v along the z-axis relative to R, the velocity u' is given by the velocity addition formulas:\n\nu'_x = (u_x) / [ γ (1 - v u_z / c² ) ]\n\nu'_y = (u_y) / [ γ (1 - v u_z / c² ) ]\n\nu'_z = (u_z - v ) / [ 1 - v u_z / c² ]\n\nTherefore, the gamma factor in R' is γ_{u'} = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u'^2)/c² )\n\nTherefore, the momentum in R' is p' = γ_{u'} m u'\n\nThis seems complicated, but for our case, the particle is at rest in R, so u = 0. Therefore, in R', the velocity u' is -v (since the COM frame is moving at v relative to R, so R is moving at -v relative to R'). Therefore, the particle's velocity in R' is -v. Therefore, its momentum in R' is γ_v m (-v), where γ_v = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ). Therefore, p'_p_z = - γ_v β m c, since v = β c. Wait, let me write it properly.\n\nIf the particle is at rest in R, then in R', it's moving at velocity -v. Therefore, its momentum is p'_p = γ ( -v ) m, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ). Therefore, p'_p_z = - γ m v. Since v = β c, this is - γ m β c. Ah! So previously, I had p'_p_z = - γ β m, but that was missing a factor of c. Therefore, the correct expression is p'_p_z = - γ β m c. This explains the unit inconsistency before. So where did I get the previous expression?\n\nEarlier, I used the formula p'_z = γ (p_z - β E / c² ). For the particle at rest, p_z = 0, E = m c², so p'_z = γ (0 - β m c² / c² ) = - γ β m. But according to the velocity transformation approach, it should be - γ β m c. Therefore, there's a discrepancy. This suggests that my earlier application of the Lorentz transformation formula was incorrect. Let me figure out why.\n\nThe formula p'_z = γ (p_z - β E / c² ) must be correct, but I must have made a mistake in the units. Let me check again. If p'_z has units of mass * velocity, then:\n\nγ (p_z - β E / c² ) must have units of mass * velocity. Given that p_z has units of mass * velocity, β E / c² has units of mass (as before), so how can p_z - β E / c² have units of mass * velocity? It can't, unless there is a missing velocity term. This suggests that the correct formula is p'_z = γ (p_z - β E / (c² ) * c ) or something like that. Wait, let me think.\n\nActually, let me derive the formula from the velocity transformation. For the particle at rest in R, its momentum in R' is p'_p_z = - γ m v, where v is the velocity of R' relative to R (β c). On the other hand, using the formula p'_z = γ (p_z - β E / c² ), we have p'_z = γ (0 - β (m c² ) / c² ) = - γ β m. To reconcile these two results, we must have:\n\n- γ β m = - γ m v / c ? No, wait the correct result from velocity transformation is - γ m v, and the formula gives - γ β m. Therefore, equating:\n\n- γ β m = - γ m v => β = v. But β is v/c, so this suggests that there's a missing factor of c in the formula. Therefore, the correct formula must be p'_z = γ (p_z - β E / (c² ) * c ) or similar. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me check a textbook or reference.\n\nAccording to the Lorentz transformation for momentum, the correct formula is:\n\np'_z = γ (p_z - β E / c )\n\nWait, if that's the case, then for the particle at rest, p'_z = γ (0 - β m c² / c ) = - γ β m c, which matches the result from the velocity transformation. Yes! So I had the wrong formula before. The correct formula is p'_z = γ (p_z - β E / c ). Previously, I had β E / c², which was incorrect. This explains the unit inconsistency. So the correct formula has β E / c, not β E / c². Let me verify units:\n\nβ is dimensionless, E has units of mass * velocity², c has units of velocity. Therefore, β E / c has units of (mass * velocity² ) / velocity = mass * velocity, which matches the units of p_z. Great! So my earlier mistake was in the Lorentz transformation formula, using β E / c² instead of β E / c. This was the source of the unit inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, correcting this, let's redo the calculation.\n\nFor the particle at rest in lab frame, its momentum in COM frame is:\n\np'_p_z = γ (p_z - β E / c ) = γ (0 - β (m c² ) / c ) = - γ β m c\n\nFor the photon, moving along z-axis in lab frame with energy E_γ = hν and momentum p_γ = hν / c, its momentum in COM frame is:\n\np'_γ_z = γ (p_γ - β E_γ / c ) = γ ( hν / c - β hν / c ) = γ hν / c (1 - β )\n\nNow, in COM frame, total momentum is zero, so:\n\np'_p_z + p'_γ_z = 0 => - γ β m c + γ hν / c (1 - β ) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by γ:\n\n- β m c + hν / c (1 - β ) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by c to eliminate denominators:\n\n- β m c² + hν (1 - β ) = 0\n\nRearrange:\n\nhν (1 - β ) = β m c²\n\nNow, substitute hν = α m c²:\n\nα m c² (1 - β ) = β m c²\n\nCancel m c² from both sides:\n\nα (1 - β ) = β\n\nExpand:\n\nα - α β = β\n\nBring terms with β to one side:\n\nα = β + α β = β (1 + α )\n\nTherefore:\n\nβ = α / (1 + α )\n\nWhich matches the result I obtained earlier through the simpler method of β = (P_total c²)/E_total. This confirms that the correct answer is option C.\n\nTherefore, despite the initial confusion and mistake in the Lorentz transformation formula, the final result is consistent. This shows the importance of checking units and cross-verifying with different methods.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option C: α × 1/(1 + α).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
