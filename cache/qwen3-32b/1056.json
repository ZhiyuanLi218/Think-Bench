The question says that dissolving one mole of each in water gives different pH values. Hmm. Alright, let me start by recalling what percentage ionization means. It's a measure of how much of the acid dissociates into ions in solution. Strong acids ionize completely, while weak acids only partially ionize. So, the higher the percentage ionization, the stronger the acid, right?\n\nBut wait, the question is about percentage ionization. So if an acid is strong, like HCl, it would have 100% ionization. But among the options given here, which one is the strongest? Let me look at the options.\n\nOption A is HNO2. I remember that nitrous acid is a weak acid. It doesn't completely dissociate in water. Its ionization is partial. The Ka value for HNO2 is something like 4.5 x 10^-4. Not super high, but not the lowest.\n\nOption B is HClO4. That's perchloric acid. Wait, isn't that a strong acid? I think the common strong acids are HCl, HBr, HI, HNO3, H2SO4 (first proton), HClO4. So perchloric acid is a strong acid, so it should have 100% ionization. But wait, if it's a strong acid, then it would have 100% ionization. But the question is about percentage ionization. So if HClO4 is a strong acid, it would have 100% ionization. But the other options are all weak acids. So then, why is this an option? The question says \"different pH values,\" so maybe they are all in dilute solutions? Wait, but the question is about one mole dissolved in water. So maybe the concentration is 1 M? If that's the case, then strong acids would have 100% ionization, and weak acids would have lower percentages.\n\nBut the problem is asking which of the acids will have the highest percentage ionization. If one of them is a strong acid, then it's 100%, which is the highest possible. So then the answer would be B, HClO4. But maybe I need to check if HClO4 is indeed a strong acid. Let me confirm. Yes, perchloric acid is one of the seven strong acids. So HClO4 is a strong acid, so it would have 100% ionization. The rest are weak acids. So their percentage ionization would be less than 100%, so HClO4 is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options to be sure. Option C is H2S. Hydrogen sulfide. That's a weak acid, right? It's a diprotic acid, but both protons don't ionize completely. The first ionization is very weak. Ka1 is around 1.3 x 10^-7. So definitely a weak acid. So percentage ionization would be low.\n\nOption D is H3PO4. Phosphoric acid. That's a triprotic acid. The first ionization is moderate strength. The Ka1 for H3PO4 is around 7.5 x 10^-3. So that's stronger than HNO2. Wait, HNO2 has a Ka of ~4.5 x 10^-4, so H3PO4 has a higher Ka, meaning it's a stronger acid than HNO2. So for the first ionization, H3PO4 would have a higher percentage ionization than HNO2. But since it's triprotic, but the question is about dissolving one mole of the compound. So if we have one mole of H3PO4 in water, the first ionization would be H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second and third ionizations are weaker. But the total ionization would be the sum of all three? But percentage ionization is typically referring to the first ionization for polyprotic acids unless specified otherwise. Wait, but the question is about percentage ionization. If they are considering the total ionization from all protons, then maybe H3PO4 would have a higher total ionization than HNO2. However, HClO4 is a strong acid and would have 100% ionization. So even if H3PO4 has a higher percentage than HNO2, HClO4 is still the strongest here.\n\nSo the answer should be B, HClO4. But let me make sure I'm not missing something here. The question says \"dissolving one mole of each of the following compounds in water results in solutions with different pH values. Under those conditions, which of the following acids will have the highest percentage ionization?\" So if HClO4 is a strong acid, then its percentage ionization is 100%, which is the highest possible. The others are all weak acids with lower percentage ionizations. Therefore, B is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's a trick here. For example, sometimes when comparing weak acids, the one with the highest Ka will have the highest percentage ionization. But if one of them is a strong acid, it's automatically higher. So in this case, HClO4 is a strong acid, so it's 100%, so it's the highest. The rest are weak acids with lower percentages. So yes, B is correct.\n\nAnother thought: What if the question is about the total ionization considering all protons? For example, H3PO4 gives three H+ ions, but each subsequent ionization is weaker. However, percentage ionization for polyprotic acids is usually considered per step. So the first ionization is the main contributor. For example, if you have 1 M H3PO4, the first ionization would be about sqrt(Ka1 * C) assuming it's a weak acid. But even if you consider all three steps, the total [H+] would be higher than HNO2, but still less than 100%. So HClO4 is still the strongest here.\n\nSo I think B is the answer.\n</think>"}
