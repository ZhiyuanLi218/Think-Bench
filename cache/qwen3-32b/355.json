Let me recall the formulas I know related to gases. Hmm, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But here, I have density, which is mass per unit volume. Maybe I can relate the ideal gas law to density somehow.\n\nDensity (d) is mass (m) divided by volume (V), so d = m/V. Also, the number of moles (n) is mass (m) divided by molar mass (M), so n = m/M. Let me substitute that into the ideal gas equation. So PV = (m/M)RT. Then rearranging that, PM = (m/V)RT. Since m/V is density, that becomes PM = dRT. Oh right! So if I rearrange that, M = (dRT)/P. That seems like the formula I need here.\n\nAlright, let me note down the given values. The density (d) is 2.05 g/L. The temperature is 26.0°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin by adding 273.15. So 26.0 + 273.15 is 299.15 K. The pressure is 722 torr. Wait, the gas constant R that I usually use is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right? But the pressure here is in torr, so I need to convert that to atmospheres or use a different value of R that's compatible with torr.\n\nLet me check the units. The pressure is 722 torr. Since 1 atm = 760 torr, so P in atm would be 722 / 760. Let me calculate that. 722 divided by 760. Let's see, 722 ÷ 760 ≈ 0.9499 atm. Let me write that as approximately 0.95 atm for now. But maybe I should keep more decimal places for accuracy. Let me do the exact division: 722 ÷ 760. Let me compute 722 ÷ 760. 760 goes into 722 zero times. 760 goes into 7220 nine times (9*760=6840), subtract 6840 from 7220 gives 380. Bring down a zero: 3800. 760 goes into 3800 five times (5*760=3800). So 0.9499... So approximately 0.9499 atm.\n\nSo now, plugging into M = (dRT)/P. Let me make sure all the units are correct. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). The density is in g/L, temperature in K, pressure in atm. So units should work out. Let me compute each part.\n\nFirst, d is 2.05 g/L. R is 0.0821. T is 299.15 K. P is 0.9499 atm.\n\nSo M = (2.05 g/L * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 299.15 K) / 0.9499 atm.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 2.05 * 0.0821 * 299.15.\n\nLet me compute 2.05 * 0.0821 first. 2 * 0.0821 is 0.1642, 0.05 * 0.0821 is 0.004105. Adding together: 0.1642 + 0.004105 = 0.168305. So approximately 0.1683 g/(L·mol·K) * K? Wait, maybe I should track units.\n\nWait, actually, the units would be (g/L) * (L·atm/(mol·K)) * K = (g·atm)/(mol). Then divided by atm gives g/mol. So the units check out.\n\nSo the numerator is 2.05 * 0.0821 * 299.15. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.0821 * 299.15. Let me approximate 299.15 as 300 for estimation. 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63. But since it's 299.15, which is slightly less than 300, maybe 0.0821*(300 - 0.85) = 24.63 - 0.0821*0.85 ≈ 24.63 - 0.07 ≈ 24.56. Let me check with calculator steps.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 0.0821 * 299.15:\n\nFirst, 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63\n\nBut since it's 299.15, which is 300 - 0.85, so subtract 0.0821 * 0.85.\n\n0.0821 * 0.85 = 0.0821 * 0.8 + 0.0821 * 0.05 = 0.06568 + 0.004105 = 0.069785\n\nSo 24.63 - 0.069785 ≈ 24.5602 g·atm/mol.\n\nThen multiply by 2.05 g/L:\n\nWait, actually, the units are (g/L) * (L·atm/(mol·K)) * K = (g·atm)/(mol). So the 2.05 g/L multiplied by 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) multiplied by 299.15 K gives (g/L * L·atm/(mol·K) * K) = g·atm/mol. Then divided by atm gives g/mol.\n\nSo the numerator is 2.05 * 0.0821 * 299.15 ≈ 2.05 * 24.5602 ≈ Let's compute 2 * 24.5602 = 49.1204, and 0.05 * 24.5602 = 1.22801. Adding them gives 49.1204 + 1.22801 ≈ 50.3484 g·atm/mol.\n\nThen divide by P = 0.9499 atm. So 50.3484 / 0.9499 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 50.3484 ÷ 0.9499. Let me approximate 0.9499 as 0.95 for estimation. 50.3484 / 0.95 ≈ 52.998 g/mol. Which is approximately 53.0 g/mol. Looking at the options, A is 53.0 g/mol. So that would be option A.\n\nBut let me check if my approximations introduced errors. Let me do the exact calculation with more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, compute P in atm: 722 torr / 760 torr/atm = 722 / 760. Let me calculate that exactly. 722 divided by 760:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 361 / 380. Let me compute that as a decimal. 380 goes into 361 0. times. 380 goes into 3610 9 times (9*380=3420), remainder 190. Bring down a 0: 1900. 380 goes into 1900 5 times (5*380=1900). So exactly 0.95? Wait, 361/380 is 0.95? Wait 380*0.95 is 361? Let me check: 380 * 0.95 = 380*(1 - 0.05) = 380 - 19 = 361. Yes! So 722 torr is exactly 0.95 atm. Oh! I thought earlier it was approximately 0.9499, but actually it's exactly 0.95 atm. Because 722 / 760 = 0.95. Because 760 * 0.95 = 722. So that's exact. So P is exactly 0.95 atm. That simplifies things.\n\nSo then, the numerator was approximately 50.3484 g·atm/mol. Let me recalculate that with exact numbers.\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nFirst, compute R*T: 0.0821 * 299.15. Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 299.15 K.\n\nLet me do 0.0821 * 299.15:\n\nBreakdown:\n\nFirst, 0.08 * 299.15 = 23.932\n\nThen 0.0021 * 299.15 = ?\n\n0.002 * 299.15 = 0.5983\n\n0.0001 * 299.15 = 0.029915\n\nAdding those: 0.5983 + 0.029915 = 0.628215\n\nSo total R*T = 23.932 + 0.628215 ≈ 24.560215 L·atm/mol.\n\nThen multiply by density 2.05 g/L:\n\n2.05 * 24.560215 ≈ Let's compute 2 * 24.560215 = 49.12043, plus 0.05 * 24.560215 = 1.22801075. Total is 49.12043 + 1.22801075 ≈ 50.34844 g·atm/mol.\n\nDivide by P = 0.95 atm:\n\n50.34844 / 0.95 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute that division. 50.34844 ÷ 0.95.\n\nSince dividing by 0.95 is the same as multiplying by 1/0.95 ≈ 1.05263.\n\nSo 50.34844 * 1.05263 ≈ ?\n\nFirst, approximate 50.34844 * 1.05 = 50.34844 + 50.34844 * 0.05.\n\n50.34844 * 0.05 = 2.517422. So total is 50.34844 + 2.517422 ≈ 52.86586 g/mol.\n\nBut since 1/0.95 is approximately 1.05263, which is 1.05 + 0.00263. So we need to add a little more. Let me compute 50.34844 * 0.00263 ≈ 50.34844 * 0.002 = 0.10069688 and 50.34844 * 0.00063 ≈ 0.031719. Total ≈ 0.10069688 + 0.031719 ≈ 0.1324. So total is 52.86586 + 0.1324 ≈ 52.998 g/mol, which is approximately 53.0 g/mol. So that's very close to option A.\n\nTherefore, the molecular mass is approximately 53.0 g/mol, so the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check if I made any miscalculations. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach with different units for R to see if I get the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the gas constant R is expressed in terms of torr. Let me recall that R is 62.3637 L·Torr/(mol·K). If I use that value of R, then I don't need to convert pressure to atm.\n\nLet me try that approach. So using R = 62.3637 L·Torr/(mol·K).\n\nThen the formula is M = (dRT)/P.\n\nGiven d = 2.05 g/L, T = 299.15 K, P = 722 Torr.\n\nSo M = (2.05 g/L * 62.3637 L·Torr/(mol·K) * 299.15 K) / 722 Torr.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute R*T: 62.3637 * 299.15. Let me approximate that.\n\nFirst, 62.3637 * 300 = 18709.11, but since it's 299.15, which is 300 - 0.85, so subtract 62.3637 * 0.85.\n\nCompute 62.3637 * 0.85:\n\nFirst, 60 * 0.85 = 51, 2.3637 * 0.85 ≈ 2.3637 * 0.8 + 2.3637 * 0.05 = 1.89096 + 0.118185 ≈ 2.009145. Total ≈ 51 + 2.009145 ≈ 53.009145.\n\nTherefore, R*T ≈ 18709.11 - 53.009145 ≈ 18656.1 L·Torr/mol.\n\nThen multiply by d = 2.05 g/L:\n\n2.05 * 18656.1 ≈ Let me compute 2 * 18656.1 = 37312.2, and 0.05 * 18656.1 = 932.805. Adding them gives 37312.2 + 932.805 = 38245.005 g·Torr/mol.\n\nDivide by P = 722 Torr:\n\n38245.005 / 722 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute that division. Let me see how many times 722 goes into 38245.\n\nFirst, approximate 722 * 50 = 36,100. Subtract that from 38,245: 38,245 - 36,100 = 2,145.\n\nNow, 722 * 3 = 2,166. That's more than 2,145. So 2 times would be 1,444. 2,145 - 1,444 = 701.\n\nSo total is 50 + 2 = 52, with a remainder of 701. So approximately 52 + (701/722) ≈ 52 + 0.97 ≈ 52.97 g/mol. Which is approximately 53.0 g/mol again. So same result. Therefore, confirms that answer A is correct.\n\nTherefore, the molecular mass is 53.0 g/mol, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe molecular mass of the gas is \\boxed{A}.\n</think>"}
