Therefore, **if $K_a$ is smaller**, $K_b$ must be **larger** to maintain the product $K_w$. Hence, the statement contradicts this inverse relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B**:  \n> *\"After the zinc coating on an iron pipe is partially damaged, the iron pipe is still not prone to rusting.\"*\n\nThis statement is **correct**.  \nZinc is more reactive than iron and acts as a **sacrificial anode** in a galvanic cell. Even when the coating is partially damaged, the zinc continues to corrode preferentially, protecting the iron from oxidation (rusting). This is a well-known principle in **cathodic protection**. So the iron pipe remains protected against rusting even with a damaged coating.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C**:  \n> *\"The higher the activation energy of a reaction, the more easily the reaction proceeds.\"*\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**.  \nActivation energy is the energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to occur. A **higher activation energy** means that **fewer molecules** have sufficient energy to react at a given temperature, leading to a **slower reaction rate**. Therefore, a higher activation energy makes the reaction **less likely** to proceed easily.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D**:  \n> *\"Infrared spectroscopy cannot distinguish between $\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{OH}$ and $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OCH}_{3}$.\"*\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**.  \nInfrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for distinguishing between different functional groups.  \n- **Ethanol ($\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{OH}$)** contains an **O–H** group, which produces a **broad absorption band** in the range **3200–3600 cm⁻¹**.\n- **Dimethyl ether ($\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OCH}_{3}$)** has an **ether (C–O–C)** group, but **no O–H bond**, so it lacks the broad O–H absorption.  \n\nThus, IR spectroscopy **can** distinguish between the two compounds based on the presence or absence of the O–H stretching band.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final Answer: (B)**  \nThe correct statement is:\n\n> **(B) After the zinc coating on an iron pipe is partially damaged, the iron pipe is still not prone to rusting.**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out which of these statements is correct. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"At a certain temperature, the smaller the Ka of a monobasic weak acid HA, the smaller the Kb (hydrolysis constant) of NaA.\" Hmm. I remember that for a weak acid and its conjugate base, the product of Ka and Kb should equal Kw, the ion product of water. So if Ka is small, then Kb must be large because Kw is a constant at a given temperature. Wait, that would mean if Ka is smaller, Kb is larger. So the statement says the smaller Ka leads to smaller Kb, which is the opposite. So option A is incorrect.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"After the zinc coating on an iron pipe is partially damaged, the iron pipe is still not prone to rusting.\" Zinc is more reactive than iron, right? So in a galvanic cell, zinc would act as the anode and iron as the cathode. Even if the coating is damaged, the zinc would corrode preferentially, protecting the iron. So the iron pipe should still be protected. Therefore, option B might be correct. But wait, if the coating is partially damaged, maybe the iron is exposed. But since zinc is a sacrificial anode, it should still protect the iron. So B is correct? I think so.\n\nOption C: \"The higher the activation energy of a reaction, the more easily the reaction proceeds.\" Activation energy is the energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to occur. Higher activation energy means the reaction is harder to proceed because fewer molecules have enough energy to overcome the barrier. So a higher activation energy would make the reaction slower, not more easily proceed. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Infrared spectroscopy cannot distinguish between C2H5OH and CH3OCH3.\" Let me think about their functional groups. Ethanol (C2H5OH) has an -OH group, while dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) has an ether group. Infrared spectroscopy can detect different functional groups. The -OH group in alcohols typically shows a broad O-H stretching around 3200-3600 cm^-1, while ethers have C-O stretching around 1000-1300 cm^-1. However, maybe the question is about whether they can be distinguished. Wait, ethanol also has C-O stretching, but the presence of O-H would be a key difference. Since ether doesn't have an O-H bond, IR should be able to distinguish them based on the O-H stretch. Therefore, D is incorrect because IR can distinguish them. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For option D, maybe the user is referring to the fact that both have C-O bonds? But the presence of O-H in ethanol would be a distinct peak that's not present in the ether. So yes, IR can distinguish them. So D is incorrect. So B is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
