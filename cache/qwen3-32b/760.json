Let me recall what I know about potential energy and equilibrium points. \n\nFirst, equilibrium positions occur where the net force on the particle is zero. Since the force is conservative, it can be derived from the potential energy function. I remember that the force is the negative derivative of the potential energy with respect to position. So, F(x) = -dU/dx. Therefore, to find equilibrium points, I need to take the derivative of U(x), set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then, I have to determine which of those points are stable.\n\nLet me start by computing the derivative of U(x). The potential energy function is U(x) = (x – 2)^3 – 12x. Let me expand that derivative step by step. \n\nFirst, the derivative of (x – 2)^3 with respect to x. Using the chain rule, that would be 3(x – 2)^2 times the derivative of the inside, which is 1. So, 3(x – 2)^2. Then, the derivative of -12x is -12. Therefore, the derivative dU/dx is 3(x – 2)^2 - 12. \n\nSetting this equal to zero for equilibrium points: 3(x – 2)^2 - 12 = 0. Let me solve for x. \n\nDivide both sides by 3: (x – 2)^2 - 4 = 0. Then, (x – 2)^2 = 4. Taking square roots, x – 2 = ±2. Therefore, x = 2 + 2 = 4 or x = 2 - 2 = 0. So, the equilibrium points are at x = 0 and x = 4. Wait, but the answer choices include x = -4, -2, 0, 4. So, 0 and 4 are among the options. But the question is asking for stable equilibrium. \n\nNow, to determine whether these equilibrium points are stable or unstable, I need to look at the second derivative of the potential energy function. Because, in potential energy terms, a stable equilibrium corresponds to a local minimum of the potential energy function, whereas an unstable equilibrium corresponds to a local maximum or a saddle point. The second derivative test can help here. If the second derivative is positive at the equilibrium point, it's a local minimum (stable), and if it's negative, it's a local maximum (unstable). \n\nSo let me compute the second derivative of U(x). First derivative was 3(x - 2)^2 - 12. Taking derivative again: d^2U/dx^2 = 3 * 2(x - 2) * 1 - 0 = 6(x - 2). \n\nSo, the second derivative is 6(x - 2). Now, evaluate this at each equilibrium point. \n\nFirst, at x = 0: 6(0 - 2) = 6(-2) = -12. Since this is negative, the potential energy function has a local maximum at x = 0, meaning that this is an unstable equilibrium. \n\nAt x = 4: 6(4 - 2) = 6(2) = 12. Since this is positive, the potential energy function has a local minimum at x = 4, so this is a stable equilibrium. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D is x = 4. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, the first derivative: U(x) = (x - 2)^3 - 12x. \n\ndU/dx = 3(x - 2)^2 - 12. Correct. \n\nSetting equal to zero: 3(x - 2)^2 = 12 => (x - 2)^2 = 4 => x - 2 = ±2 => x = 4 or 0. Correct. \n\nSecond derivative: d^2U/dx^2 = 6(x - 2). Correct. \n\nAt x = 0: 6(-2) = -12 < 0 => maximum, unstable. \n\nAt x = 4: 6(2) = 12 > 0 => minimum, stable. \n\nTherefore, x = 4 is the stable equilibrium. So option D. \n\nBut let me also check if there are any other equilibrium points. The equation (x - 2)^2 = 4 only gives x = 0 and x = 4. So those are the only two critical points. The answer options also include x = -4 and x = -2, but according to my calculations, those aren't equilibrium points. However, maybe I made a mistake in computing the derivative? Let me check again. \n\nOriginal function: U(x) = (x – 2)^3 – 12x. \n\nFirst derivative: 3(x - 2)^2 - 12. Correct. \n\nIf I plug in x = -2 into the first derivative: 3(-2 - 2)^2 - 12 = 3(16) - 12 = 48 - 12 = 36 ≠ 0. Similarly, at x = -4: 3(-4 - 2)^2 - 12 = 3(36) - 12 = 108 - 12 = 96 ≠ 0. So indeed, x = -4 and x = -2 are not equilibrium points. Therefore, the only equilibria are at 0 and 4, and among those, 4 is the stable one. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should graph the potential energy function or analyze its behavior to confirm. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the force function. Since F(x) = -dU/dx = -[3(x - 2)^2 - 12] = -3(x - 2)^2 + 12. \n\nFor stable equilibrium, when you displace the particle slightly, the force should bring it back. So around x = 4, if we displace it a little to the right (x = 4 + ε), then F(x) = -3( (4 + ε - 2)^2 ) + 12 = -3( (2 + ε)^2 ) + 12. Expanding (2 + ε)^2 ≈ 4 + 4ε + ε². So F ≈ -3(4 + 4ε) + 12 = -12 -12ε + 12 = -12ε. So if ε is positive (displacement to the right), the force is negative, pushing it back left. If ε is negative (displacement to the left), the force is positive, pushing it back right. Therefore, restoring force, so stable. \n\nSimilarly, at x = 0, if we displace slightly to the right (x = 0 + ε), then F(x) = -3( (0 + ε - 2)^2 ) + 12 = -3( (-2 + ε)^2 ) + 12 ≈ -3(4 - 4ε) + 12 = -12 + 12ε + 12 = +12ε. So if ε is positive, force is positive (pushing further right), and if ε is negative, force is negative (pushing further left). Hence, unstable equilibrium. \n\nTherefore, confirms that x = 4 is stable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
