Therefore, the transmission function after the shift is **identical** to the original function.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{t_0 + t_1 \\cos(2\\pi f x)}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the transmission function after the sinusoidal grating is shifted along the x-direction by Δx = d. The original transmission function is given by t̃(x, y) = t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x). Let me start by recalling what a transmission function represents. It describes how the grating transmits light at different positions (x, y). The function here is sinusoidal in the x-direction, meaning it varies periodically with x.\n\nNow, the problem says the grating is translated by Δx = d. Since the translation is along the x-axis, the y-component shouldn't change. So, the new transmission function should be a shifted version of the original one in the x-direction. To shift a function, I remember that replacing x with (x - Δx) in the function shifts it by Δx to the right. Alternatively, if you have a function f(x), then f(x - Δx) is the function shifted by Δx in the positive x-direction. So, applying that here, the shifted transmission function should be t̃(x - Δx, y).\n\nBut let me verify that. Let me think about how shifting affects the cosine function. The original function has a cosine term: cos(2πf x). If we shift x by Δx, then the argument of the cosine becomes 2πf(x - Δx). So, expanding that, it would be 2πf x - 2πf Δx. Which is equivalent to cos(2πf x - 2πf Δx). Using the cosine identity, cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. But maybe I don't need to expand it. The main point is that shifting the function introduces a phase shift in the cosine term.\n\nSo, the new transmission function after shifting would be t₀ + t₁ cos[2πf(x - Δx)]. But Δx is given as d. However, the problem mentions that d is the spatial period of the transmission function. Wait, the spatial period is related to the frequency f. For a sinusoidal function like cos(2πf x), the spatial period is 1/f. Because the period T is the value such that 2πf T = 2π, so T = 1/f. Therefore, if the spatial period is d, then T = d = 1/f. Therefore, f = 1/d. Let me note that.\n\nSo, substituting f = 1/d into the transmission function. The original function is t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x) = t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d). Because f = 1/d. Therefore, after shifting by Δx = d, the transmission function becomes t₀ + t₁ cos[2π(x - d)/d]. Let me compute that argument: 2π(x - d)/d = 2πx/d - 2π. So, cos(2πx/d - 2π). But cosine is periodic with period 2π, so cos(θ - 2π) = cos θ. Therefore, cos(2πx/d - 2π) = cos(2πx/d). Therefore, shifting by one full period d results in the same cosine function. Therefore, the transmission function remains unchanged?\n\nWait, that seems to suggest that shifting the grating by its spatial period doesn't change the transmission function. Which makes sense, because the grating is periodic with period d. So, shifting it by one period would make it look exactly the same. Therefore, the transmission function after shifting is the same as before. Therefore, the expression is still t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d). Therefore, the answer is the same as the original function?\n\nBut let me check again. Suppose I have a cosine function with period d. If I shift it by d, since it's periodic with period d, then yes, the function is unchanged. Therefore, the transmission function after the shift is the same as before. Therefore, the expression remains t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x), or with f = 1/d, t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d).\n\nBut the problem says \"write the expression for the transmission function after the shift\". So maybe they want the expression in terms of the original variables? Let me check if there's a trick here. The original problem states that Δx = d, where d is the spatial period. But maybe I need to express the shifted function in terms of f and d without substituting f = 1/d?\n\nWait, let me go back. The original transmission function is given as t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x). The spatial period of this function is T = 1/f. The problem says that Δx = d, and d is the spatial period of the transmission function. Therefore, d = T = 1/f. Therefore, f = 1/d. Therefore, the original transmission function can be written as t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d). Now, if we shift the grating by Δx = d, then the new transmission function is t₀ + t₁ cos[2π(x - d)/d] = t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d - 2π). As cosine is 2π periodic, this is equal to t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d). Therefore, the same as before. Therefore, the transmission function is unchanged.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn't substitute f = 1/d, then the shifted function would be t₀ + t₁ cos[2πf(x - d)]. Let me write that out: cos[2πf x - 2πf d]. But since d is the spatial period, which is 1/f, so f*d = 1. Therefore, 2πf d = 2π*1 = 2π. Therefore, the argument is 2πf x - 2π. Again, cos(theta - 2π) = cos(theta), so the shifted function is same as original. Therefore, regardless of how you write it, the transmission function remains the same after shifting by one spatial period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the transmission function after the shift is the same as before, which is t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x). Alternatively, if they want it expressed in terms of d, since f = 1/d, then it's t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d). But since the original expression is already given in terms of f, maybe they want it in terms of f? The problem says \"write the expression for the transmission function after the shift\", and since shifting by d doesn't change it, the expression is same as original.\n\nBut maybe I need to show the shifted function explicitly? For example, if someone shifts a function by a period, even though it's same, maybe they want to see the intermediate step? Let me check.\n\nOriginal function: t̃(x, y) = t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x)\n\nAfter shifting by Δx = d, the function becomes t̃(x - Δx, y) = t₀ + t₁ cos[2πf (x - Δx)] = t₀ + t₁ cos[2πf x - 2πf Δx]. Since Δx = d and f*d = 1, this becomes t₀ + t₁ cos[2πf x - 2π(1)] = t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x - 2π) = t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x). Therefore, same as original. So, the answer is same as original. Therefore, the transmission function after the shift is still t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x).\n\nBut maybe the question is trying to test understanding of shifting and periodicity. So, even though the result is the same, perhaps they want to see the expression written with the shift, but recognizing that it's equivalent? For example, writing t₀ + t₁ cos[2πf(x - d)] and then noting that it simplifies to original. But since the problem says \"write the expression\", maybe they just want the mathematical expression after shifting, regardless of simplification? Let me check the exact wording: \"Write the expression for the transmission function after the shift (where d is the spatial period of the transmission function).\"\n\nSo, they might accept either form. But since d is the spatial period, which is 1/f, maybe they want it expressed in terms of d? Let me think. If I write the shifted function as t₀ + t₁ cos[2π(x - d)/d], that would be t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d - 2π), which simplifies to t₀ + t₁ cos(2πx/d). But if I leave it as t₀ + t₁ cos[2πf(x - d)], with f = 1/d, then it's equivalent.\n\nBut since the original expression uses f, and the problem mentions that d is the spatial period (so f = 1/d), perhaps they want the answer expressed in terms of f? However, since the shift is by d, which is 1/f, maybe they want to see the substitution. Alternatively, maybe they want to see the phase shift? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Suppose someone doesn't realize that shifting by a full period doesn't change the function. Maybe they think that Δx is arbitrary, but here Δx is specifically the spatial period. Therefore, the answer is the same function. Therefore, the expression is unchanged.\n\nAlternatively, if Δx was not an integer multiple of the period, then the function would change. But here it's exactly one period. Therefore, the answer is same as original.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that the transmission function remains t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x). Therefore, the expression is unchanged.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose I have a cosine function cos(2πx/d). If I shift x by d, then cos[2π(x - d)/d] = cos(2πx/d - 2π) = cos(2πx/d), because cosine has a period of 2π. So yes, the function is the same. Therefore, the transmission function after shifting is same as before. Therefore, the answer is the same expression.\n\nSo, the final answer is the same as the original transmission function. Therefore, the expression is t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x). But maybe they want it written explicitly as a shifted function, even though it simplifies? For example, writing it as t₀ + t₁ cos[2πf(x - d)]? But since that simplifies to original, maybe both are acceptable? However, since the problem says \"write the expression after the shift\", maybe they expect the form with the shift applied, but since it simplifies, perhaps either is okay. However, in most cases, if you shift by a full period, you would note that it's equivalent to the original. Therefore, probably safest to write the simplified version, which is same as original.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the transmission function after shifting by Δx = d is the same as the original, so the expression is t₀ + t₁ cos(2πf x).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe transmission function after the shift is \\boxed{t_0 + t_1 \\cos(2\\pi f x)}.\n</think>"}
