So, the question is about finding the average transmembrane current when the potential difference across a cell membrane changes. They've given that the cell membrane can be considered as a capacitor with a capacitance of 1 × 10⁻⁸ F. The time taken for the potential difference to change is 2 milliseconds, going from -70 mV to 30 mV. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between current, capacitance, and voltage change. I remember that for a capacitor, the charge Q is related to capacitance C and voltage V by Q = C * V. Also, current is the rate of flow of charge, so I = ΔQ / Δt. Since the voltage is changing, the charge will also change, so maybe I can use these two equations together.\n\nLet me write down the given values first:\n\nCapacitance, C = 1 × 10⁻⁸ F\n\nTime interval, Δt = 2 ms = 2 × 10⁻³ seconds\n\nInitial voltage, V_initial = -70 mV = -70 × 10⁻³ volts\n\nFinal voltage, V_final = 30 mV = 30 × 10⁻³ volts\n\nSo, the change in voltage, ΔV = V_final - V_initial\n\nCalculating ΔV:\n\nΔV = 30 × 10⁻³ V - (-70 × 10⁻³ V) = 30 × 10⁻³ + 70 × 10⁻³ = 100 × 10⁻³ V = 0.1 V\n\nOkay, so the voltage changes by 0.1 volts. Now, the change in charge ΔQ on the capacitor would be C * ΔV. Therefore:\n\nΔQ = C * ΔV = (1 × 10⁻⁸ F) * 0.1 V = 1 × 10⁻⁹ Coulombs\n\nWait, let me check that again. 1 × 10⁻⁸ times 0.1 is indeed 1 × 10⁻⁹? Yes, because 0.1 is 10⁻¹, so multiplying 10⁻⁸ by 10⁻¹ gives 10⁻⁹. So ΔQ is 1 × 10⁻⁹ C.\n\nThen, the average current I_avg is ΔQ / Δt.\n\nSo, I_avg = (1 × 10⁻⁹ C) / (2 × 10⁻³ s) = (1 / 2) × 10⁻⁹ / 10⁻³ = 0.5 × 10⁻⁶ A = 5 × 10⁻⁷ A.\n\nWait, that gives me 5 × 10⁻⁷ A, which is option D. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nLet me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, converting the voltages:\n\n-70 mV is -0.07 V, 30 mV is 0.03 V. The difference between them is 0.03 - (-0.07) = 0.1 V. Correct.\n\nCapacitance is 1e-8 F. So ΔQ = C * ΔV = 1e-8 F * 0.1 V = 1e-9 C. Correct.\n\nTime is 2 ms = 0.002 seconds. So current is charge over time: 1e-9 C / 0.002 s = 1e-9 / 2e-3 = (1/2) * 1e-6 = 5e-7 A. Yes, that's 5 × 10⁻⁷ A, which is option D. Hmm, but let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are:\n\n(A) 1.5 × 10⁻⁷ A\n\n(B) 2 × 10⁻⁷ A\n\n(C) 3.5 × 10⁻⁷ A\n\n(D) 5 × 10⁻⁷ A\n\nSo according to my calculation, the answer is D. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign? But since we're talking about the magnitude of the current, the sign shouldn't matter here. The question asks for the average value of the transmembrane current. So even if the direction is changing, the average current would be based on the net charge transferred over time. But in this case, since the voltage is changing from -70 to +30 mV, the charge is definitely moving in a direction that causes that voltage change, and the magnitude is what we calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider something else? For example, is the capacitance given per unit area or something? But the problem states \"the cell membrane is regarded as a 1 × 10⁻⁸ F capacitor,\" so I think that is the total capacitance for the entire membrane in question. So using that value directly should be correct.\n\nLet me check the calculation once more:\n\nΔV = 0.1 V\n\nC = 1e-8 F\n\nΔQ = 1e-8 * 0.1 = 1e-9 C\n\nΔt = 2e-3 s\n\nI_avg = ΔQ / Δt = 1e-9 / 2e-3 = 0.5e-6 = 5e-7 A. Yes, 5 × 10⁻⁷ A. So option D.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a trick here? For example, sometimes in these problems, you have to consider that the capacitor is discharging and charging, but here it's just a change in voltage. The formula I used is straightforward: current equals capacitance times the rate of change of voltage. Wait, another way to think about it is I = C * dV/dt. Since we are dealing with average current, it would be I_avg = C * (ΔV / Δt). Let me check this formula.\n\nYes, because if I = dQ/dt and Q = C*V, then I = C*dV/dt. Therefore, average current would be I_avg = C * (ΔV / Δt). Let me compute this way:\n\nΔV / Δt = 0.1 V / 0.002 s = 50 V/s\n\nThen I_avg = 1e-8 F * 50 V/s = 5e-7 A. Same result. So this confirms it. Therefore, the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, the options given include D as 5 × 10⁻⁷ A. So that's correct. However, I want to make sure that I didn't miscalculate the exponents.\n\nLet me write all steps with exponents:\n\nΔV = 0.1 V = 1 × 10⁻¹ V\n\nC = 1 × 10⁻⁸ F\n\nΔt = 2 × 10⁻³ s\n\nSo I_avg = C * ΔV / Δt = (1e-8 F) * (1e-1 V) / (2e-3 s) = (1e-9) / (2e-3) A = (1 / 2) * 1e-6 A = 0.5 × 10⁻⁶ A = 5 × 10⁻⁷ A. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. But let me check once again if the question is asking for average current. Yes, \"average value of the transmembrane current in this process\". So, all steps are correct. Therefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
