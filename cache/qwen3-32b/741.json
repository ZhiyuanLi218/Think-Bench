Hmm, arithmetic mean is just the sum of all the numbers divided by how many there are, right? So first, maybe I should figure out how many three-digit palindromes there are, and then find their total sum. Let me start with that.\n\nFirst, what's a three-digit palindrome? It's a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, like 121 or 343. The first digit can't be zero because it's a three-digit number. So the general form of a three-digit palindrome would be aba, where a is a digit from 1 to 9 and b is a digit from 0 to 9. So, for example, if a=1 and b=2, the number is 121.\n\nSo, how many such numbers are there? Well, for the first digit (a), there are 9 possibilities (1-9), and for the middle digit (b), there are 10 possibilities (0-9). The last digit is determined by the first digit since it has to be a palindrome. So total number of three-digit palindromes is 9*10 = 90. Let me check that... Yeah, since the first digit can't be zero, but the middle digit can. So 9*10 = 90. Okay, so there are 90 three-digit palindromes.\n\nNow, to find the arithmetic mean, I need the sum of all these 90 numbers divided by 90. So maybe I can figure out the sum first. Let me think about how to calculate the sum.\n\nEach three-digit palindrome is of the form aba. So, in numerical terms, that's 100*a + 10*b + a. Which simplifies to 101*a + 10*b. So each palindrome can be represented as 101a + 10b. Therefore, the total sum would be the sum over all a and b of (101a + 10b). Which can be separated into two sums: 101*(sum of a over all a and b) + 10*(sum of b over all a and b). \n\nBut since for each a, b ranges from 0 to 9, and for each b, a ranges from 1 to 9. Wait, actually, since a and b are independent variables here. For each a (from 1-9), there are 10 different b's (from 0-9). Therefore, the total sum of a over all palindromes is sum_{a=1}^9 [a * 10], because for each a, it's used in 10 different palindromes (with b from 0-9). Similarly, the total sum of b over all palindromes is sum_{b=0}^9 [b * 9], because for each b, it's used in 9 different palindromes (with a from 1-9).\n\nTherefore, the total sum S would be:\n\nS = 101*(sum_{a=1}^9 (10*a)) + 10*(sum_{b=0}^9 (9*b))\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute sum_{a=1}^9 (10*a). That's 10*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9). The sum from 1 to 9 is (9*10)/2 = 45. Therefore, this part is 10*45 = 450.\n\nThen, compute sum_{b=0}^9 (9*b). That's 9*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 9). The sum from 0 to 9 is (9*10)/2 = 45 as well. Wait, no, sum from 0 to 9 is same as sum from 1 to 9 plus 0, so still 45. Therefore, this part is 9*45 = 405.\n\nTherefore, total sum S is 101*450 + 10*405. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 101*450. Hmm, 100*450 = 45,000 and 1*450 = 450, so total is 45,000 + 450 = 45,450.\n\nThen, 10*405 is 4,050.\n\nAdding those together: 45,450 + 4,050 = 49,500.\n\nSo the total sum of all three-digit palindromes is 49,500. Then, since there are 90 numbers, the arithmetic mean is 49,500 divided by 90.\n\nLet me do that division. 49,500 / 90. Let's simplify. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10 first: 4,950 / 9. Now, divide 4,950 by 9. 9*500 = 4,500. Subtract that from 4,950: 4,950 - 4,500 = 450. Then 450 / 9 = 50. So total is 500 + 50 = 550. Therefore, the arithmetic mean is 550.\n\nWait, let me check that division again. 9*550 is 9*500 + 9*50 = 4,500 + 450 = 4,950. Yes, so 4,950 divided by 9 is indeed 550. Therefore, the arithmetic mean is 550. \n\nBut let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Maybe by considering the average of the first and last digits and the middle digit?\n\nSince each palindrome is aba, which is 101a + 10b. So if I think of the average value of a and the average value of b, then compute 101*average(a) + 10*average(b). Since there are 90 numbers, the average a would be (sum of a's)/90, and average b would be (sum of b's)/90.\n\nEarlier, we found that sum of a's is 10*(1+2+...+9) = 450, so average a is 450 / 90 = 5. Similarly, sum of b's is 9*(0+1+...+9) = 405, so average b is 405 / 90 = 4.5. Therefore, the average palindrome would be 101*5 + 10*4.5. Let me compute that.\n\n101*5 is 505. 10*4.5 is 45. Adding them together: 505 + 45 = 550. Same result! So that confirms it. Therefore, the arithmetic mean is indeed 550. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. For example, the three-digit palindromes range from 101 to 999. But wait, not all numbers in between are palindromes. However, maybe there's some symmetry here. For example, if you pair each palindrome with another one where the digits are mirrored? Wait, but since it's a palindrome, mirroring it gives the same number. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since the first digit and the last digit are the same, maybe the average of the first and last digits is same as average of first digit. Since they are same. So the average of the first and last digits is 5, as we saw. And the middle digit averages to 4.5. So if we think of the number as having hundreds digit a, tens digit b, and units digit a. Then the average hundreds digit is 5, average tens digit is 4.5, average units digit is 5. Therefore, the average number would be 5*100 + 4.5*10 + 5*1. Let's compute that: 500 + 45 + 5 = 550. Same answer again. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the arithmetic mean is 550. \n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can check by listing some palindromes and calculating their average, although with 90 numbers it's impractical, but maybe take a smaller case. For example, let's take a=1 and all b's. So palindromes from 101, 111, 121,..., 191. There are 10 numbers here. Let's compute their average. The numbers are 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191. The average of these numbers. \n\nAlternatively, since they are 101 + 10*b where b is 0-9. So the average is 101 + 10*(average of b). The average of b from 0-9 is 4.5, so 101 + 10*4.5 = 101 + 45 = 146. Let me check by adding them up:\n\n101 + 111 = 212\n\n212 + 121 = 333\n\n333 + 131 = 464\n\n464 + 141 = 605\n\n605 + 151 = 756\n\n756 + 161 = 917\n\n917 + 171 = 1088\n\n1088 + 181 = 1269\n\n1269 + 191 = 1460\n\nTotal sum is 1460. Divide by 10: 146. Correct. Which matches our formula. And according to our overall calculation, the average of all palindromes is 550. If we take the average of averages? Not sure, but since each a from 1-9 has similar structure.\n\nFor example, when a=1, average is 146; when a=2, the average would be 202 + 10*4.5 = 202 + 45 = 247. Similarly, for a=3: 303 + 45 = 348, and so on up to a=9: 909 + 45 = 954. Then, if we take the average of these averages for a=1 to 9. Since each a has 10 numbers, the overall average is the average of these 9 averages. \n\nSo let's compute that. The averages for each a are 146, 247, 348, 449, 550, 651, 752, 853, 954. Let me check that. For a=1, it's 101 + 45 = 146; for a=2, 202 + 45 = 247, yes. And so on. Now, the average of these numbers. Let's add them up:\n\nLet me note that these numbers form an arithmetic sequence themselves. Starting at 146, increasing by 101 each time? Wait, 247 - 146 = 101. 348 - 247 = 101. Yes, each subsequent average is 101 more. So there are 9 terms. The average of an arithmetic sequence is (first + last)/2. Therefore, (146 + 954)/2 = (1100)/2 = 550. Exactly! Therefore, the average of all the palindromes is 550. \n\nTherefore, this method also gives 550. Therefore, multiple methods confirm that the arithmetic mean is 550. \n\nJust to be 100% sure, maybe compute another partial sum. For example, take all palindromes with a=1 and a=2. There are 20 numbers. Their total sum would be 146*10 + 247*10 = 1460 + 2470 = 3930. The average of these 20 numbers is 3930 / 20 = 196.5. According to our overall formula, if we take the average of 146 and 247, which is (146 + 247)/2 = 393 / 2 = 196.5. Correct. And if we take the overall average of all 9 groups, it's 550. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire sum as adding up all the 101a + 10b. Which we did earlier. So I think all methods lead to 550. Therefore, I can be confident that the arithmetic mean of all three-digit palindromes is 550.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe arithmetic mean of all the three-digit palindromes is \\boxed{550}.\n</think>"}
