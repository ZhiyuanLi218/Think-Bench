This stability is most commonly associated with the electron configuration of a noble gas, which is highly stable due to completely filled electron shells. \n\n- **Option A (Very soluble)** is incorrect because solubility is a property of compounds, not individual ions. For example, while Na⁺ is soluble in water when paired with Cl⁻ in NaCl, solubility depends on the combination of ions, not the ion itself.\n  \n- **Option B (Very electronegative)** is not universally applicable. While anions (like Cl⁻) are formed by electronegative elements, cations (like Na⁺) are formed by metals with low electronegativity. The term \"very electronegative\" does not accurately describe all monatomic ions of representative elements.\n\n- **Option C (Isoelectronic with a noble gas)** is correct. Representative elements (main group elements) form monatomic ions by gaining or losing electrons to attain the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas. For example:\n  - Na (atomic number 11) loses one electron to become Na⁺, which has the same electron configuration as neon (Ne, atomic number 10).\n  - Cl (atomic number 17) gains one electron to become Cl⁻, which has the same configuration as argon (Ar, atomic number 18).\n  This is a fundamental concept in ionic bonding for main group elements.\n\n- **Option D (Highly colored)** is incorrect. While some transition metal ions are colored, representative elements (main group elements) generally form colorless ions. For example, Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are both colorless in solution.\n\n**Answer:** C: isoelectronic with a noble gas.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about monatomic ions of representative elements. The options are A through D. Let me start by recalling what I know about monatomic ions and representative elements.\n\nFirst, representative elements are the ones in the s-block and p-block of the periodic table. These include groups 1, 2, and 13-18. Monatomic ions are ions composed of a single atom, like Na+ or Cl-.\n\nNow, the question is asking what these ions are often. The options are about solubility, electronegativity, being isoelectronic with noble gases, or being highly colored.\n\nLet me break down each option. \n\nOption A: very soluble. Solubility usually refers to how well a substance dissolves in a solvent, typically water. But solubility depends on the compound, not just the ion itself. For example, Na+ ions are soluble in water when paired with Cl- to form NaCl, but other salts might not be. However, the question is about the ions themselves, not the compounds they form. So maybe solubility isn't the right answer here because it's more about the compound's properties rather than the ion's inherent property.\n\nOption B: very electronegative. Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract electrons in a bond. However, once an atom becomes an ion, especially a monatomic ion, it's either a cation (positive) or anion (negative). Cations are typically metals, which are less electronegative, and anions are nonmetals, which are more electronegative. But the term \"very electronegative\" might not be the best fit for the ions themselves. For example, O^2- is an anion and would be more electronegative than its neutral atom, but I'm not sure if the ion itself is described as \"very electronegative\" in this context. Also, the question is about representative elements, which include both metals and nonmetals. So maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption C: isoelectronic with a noble gas. Isoelectronic means having the same electron configuration. When representative elements form monatomic ions, they tend to gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, which is typically that of a noble gas. For example, Na+ has the same electron configuration as neon, and Cl- has the same as argon. This seems like a key concept in ionic bonding. Metals lose electrons to form cations with the electron configuration of the previous noble gas, and nonmetals gain electrons to achieve the next noble gas configuration. So this option sounds very plausible.\n\nOption D: highly colored. Some ions are indeed colored, like transition metal ions such as Cu^2+ (blue) or Fe^3+ (yellow/brown). However, the question is about monatomic ions of representative elements. Transition metals are not considered representative elements (they're in the d-block). Representative elements are main group elements, so their ions might not be as colorful. For example, Na+ is colorless, Cl- is colorless. So maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nPutting this together: the key idea in ionic bonding for main group elements is achieving a noble gas configuration. Therefore, the answer is likely C: isoelectronic with a noble gas.\n</think>"}
