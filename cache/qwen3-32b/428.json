And then write it with a rational denominator. Hmm, that sounds like multiple layers of roots. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the expression. It's sqrt( [cube root( sqrt(1/729) )] ). So starting from the inside: sqrt(1/729). Let me compute that first. The square root of 1/729. Well, square root of 1 is 1, and square root of 729 is... hmm, 729 is 27 squared, right? 27*27 is 729. Wait, 27*27 is 729? Let me check: 25*25 is 625, 30*30 is 900, so yes, 27*27 is 729. So sqrt(729) is 27. Therefore, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 1/27.\n\nNow, moving one layer out: cube root of that result. So cube root of 1/27. Well, 27 is 3 cubed, right? 3*3*3 is 27. Therefore, cube root of 27 is 3. So cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. So now we have that the cube root part simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow the outermost layer: square root of that. So sqrt(1/3). Hmm, okay. Now the problem says to write it with a rational denominator. So sqrt(1/3) can be written as sqrt(1)/sqrt(3) which is 1/sqrt(3). But having a square root in the denominator isn't rational. To rationalize the denominator, I need to multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3). Let me do that.\n\nSo 1/sqrt(3) multiplied by sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) equals sqrt(3)/3. So that would be the simplified form with a rational denominator. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with sqrt(1/729). Since 729 is 27², sqrt(1/729) is 1/27. Then cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3³, cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then square root of 1/3 is 1 over sqrt(3), which rationalizes to sqrt(3)/3. Seems good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this using exponents instead of radicals. Let me try that method to verify.\n\nOriginal expression: sqrt( [cube root( sqrt(1/729) )] )\n\nFirst, express all radicals as exponents. Remember that sqrt(a) is a^(1/2), cube root is a^(1/3), etc.\n\nSo starting from inside: sqrt(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2). Then take the cube root of that: [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3). Then take the square root of that: [ [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) ]^(1/2).\n\nUsing exponent rules, when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So let me compute the exponents step by step.\n\nFirst, starting with (1/729)^(1/2). Then raising that to 1/3: exponent becomes (1/2)*(1/3) = 1/6. Then raising that to 1/2: exponent becomes 1/6 * 1/2 = 1/12. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nSo now I need to compute (1/729)^(1/12). Let me think about 729. As before, 729 is 9^3, since 9*9*9 is 729? Wait, 9*9 is 81, 81*9 is 729. Yes. Also, 9 is 3^2, so 729 is (3^2)^3 = 3^6. Therefore, 729 is 3^6. Therefore, 1/729 is 3^(-6). Therefore, (3^(-6))^(1/12) is 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/(3^(1/2)) = 1/sqrt(3), which again is sqrt(3)/3 after rationalizing. So same result. So that confirms my previous answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it? Let me see. If I consider all the roots as exponents multiplied together. The original expression is sqrt( cube root( sqrt( ... ))). So each radical is an exponent. So sqrt is 1/2, cube root is 1/3, and another sqrt is 1/2. So multiplying all exponents together: 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/12. So the entire thing is (1/729)^(1/12), which again is the same as above.\n\nSo regardless of the method, I get to (1/729)^(1/12) which simplifies to 3^(-1/2) which is 1 over sqrt(3), rationalized to sqrt(3)/3.\n\nLet me check if 729 is indeed 3^6. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729. Yes, correct. So 3^6=729. Therefore, 1/729=3^{-6}. Then raising that to 1/12 gives 3^{-6*(1/12)}=3^{-1/2}=1/3^{1/2}=1/sqrt(3)=sqrt(3)/3. All steps check out.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3. So I think that is the answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure that there isn't a simpler way or maybe another form. For example, sometimes problems might expect something else, but in this case, since we have to have a rational denominator, sqrt(3)/3 is the standard form. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute decimal values to check. Let me compute the original expression numerically and my answer numerically to see if they match.\n\nFirst, original expression:\n\nStart with 1/729 ≈ 0.001371742.\n\nsqrt(1/729) ≈ sqrt(0.001371742) ≈ 0.037. Since 0.037^2 ≈ 0.001369, which is close to 1/729 ≈ 0.0013717. So approx 0.037.\n\nThen cube root of 0.037. Let me compute 0.037^(1/3). Let me note that 0.037 is approx 3.7 x 10^-2. The cube root of 3.7 x 10^-2 is approx cube root(3.7) x 10^(-2/3). Cube root of 3.7 is approx 1.546, and 10^(-2/3) is approx 0.2154. Multiplying them: 1.546 * 0.2154 ≈ 0.333. Which is approx 1/3. Which matches our previous result. Then take the square root of 1/3 ≈ 0.577. Which is sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 1.732 / 3 ≈ 0.577. So yes, that matches. So numerically, the value is approx 0.577, which is sqrt(3)/3. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute (1/729)^(1/12). Let me take natural logarithm: ln(1/729) = -ln(729) ≈ -6.588. Divide by 12: ≈ -0.549. Exponentiate: e^{-0.549} ≈ 0.577. Which is same as above. So that also checks out. So all methods converge to the same decimal value. So that gives me more confidence.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The simplified expression with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified expression with a rational denominator is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}.\n</think>"}
