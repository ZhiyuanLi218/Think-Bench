So, we have three solutions being made, and we need to find the difference in pH between solution3 and solution2. The answer options are given, so I need to calculate pH2 and pH3 and subtract them. Let me start by breaking down each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's tackle solution1. It's made by mixing 20 cm³ of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid) with 40 cm³ of 0.02 M NaOH. Then, solution2 is solution1 plus 5 cm³ of 0.02 M NaOH. Solution3 is 5 cm³ of 0.02 M NaOH added to 60 cm³ water. So, solution3 is just a diluted NaOH solution, right? While solution2 is a buffer solution or something else?\n\nLet me start with solution1. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, they form sodium acetate and water. The reaction is:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many moles of each reactant we have. Let's convert cm³ to liters because molarity is in mol/L. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, 40 cm³ is 0.04 L.\n\nMoles of CH3COOH = 0.1 M * 0.02 L = 0.002 moles.\n\nMoles of NaOH = 0.02 M * 0.04 L = 0.0008 moles.\n\nSo, the NaOH will react with the acetic acid. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will completely react with the acetic acid. The moles of NaOH (0.0008) is less than the moles of acetic acid (0.002). So, the reaction will consume 0.0008 moles of CH3COOH and produce 0.0008 moles of CH3COO^- (acetate ion). The remaining moles of CH3COOH will be 0.002 - 0.0008 = 0.0012 moles.\n\nNow, the total volume of solution1 is 20 + 40 = 60 cm³ = 0.06 L.\n\nSo, concentrations after reaction:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.0012 moles / 0.06 L = 0.02 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.0008 moles / 0.06 L ≈ 0.01333 M.\n\nThis is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH1.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])\n\nFirst, let's calculate pKa. Given Ka = 1.85*10^-5, so pKa = -log(1.85*10^-5). Let me compute that.\n\nlog(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733? Wait, let me do it more accurately.\n\nKa = 1.85×10⁻⁵. pKa = -log(1.85×10⁻⁵). Let me compute that:\n\nlog(1.85×10⁻⁵) = log(1.85) + log(10⁻⁵) ≈ 0.267 - 5 = -4.733. Therefore pKa ≈ 4.733.\n\nSo pH1 = 4.733 + log(0.01333 / 0.02).\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.01333 / 0.02 = 0.6665. log(0.6665) ≈ -0.176. Therefore pH1 ≈ 4.733 - 0.176 ≈ 4.557. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 0.01333 divided by 0.02 is indeed 2/3, which is approximately 0.6667. The log of 2/3 is log(2) - log(3) ≈ 0.3010 - 0.4771 = -0.1761. Yes, so pH1 ≈ 4.733 - 0.176 ≈ 4.557. Let me note that.\n\nSo pH1 is approximately 4.56. But let me keep more decimals for accuracy. Maybe I should carry more precise numbers.\n\nBut let's move on. Now, solution2 is made by adding 5 cm³ of 0.02 M NaOH to solution1. So solution1 is 60 cm³, adding 5 cm³ of NaOH, making total volume 65 cm³.\n\nFirst, let's find moles of NaOH added in this second step. 5 cm³ = 0.005 L. 0.02 M * 0.005 L = 0.0001 moles of NaOH.\n\nNow, solution1 already has some acetic acid and acetate. The new NaOH will react with the remaining acetic acid in solution1.\n\nFrom solution1, before adding more NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH were 0.0012 moles and CH3COO^- were 0.0008 moles.\n\nAdding 0.0001 moles of NaOH will react with 0.0001 moles of CH3COOH, converting it to CH3COO^-.\n\nSo new moles of CH3COOH: 0.0012 - 0.0001 = 0.0011 moles.\n\nNew moles of CH3COO^-: 0.0008 + 0.0001 = 0.0009 moles.\n\nTotal volume now is 60 + 5 = 65 cm³ = 0.065 L.\n\nConcentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.0011 / 0.065 ≈ 0.01692 M\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.0009 / 0.065 ≈ 0.01385 M\n\nAgain, using Henderson-Hasselbalch:\n\npH2 = pKa + log([base]/[acid]) = 4.733 + log(0.01385 / 0.01692)\n\nCompute the ratio: 0.01385 / 0.01692 ≈ 0.818. log(0.818) ≈ -0.087.\n\nTherefore pH2 ≈ 4.733 - 0.087 ≈ 4.646. Let me verify.\n\nWait, 0.01385 divided by 0.01692 is approximately 0.818. log(0.818) is indeed around -0.087. So pH2 ≈ 4.65.\n\nBut let me check if there's any error here. The initial calculation for solution1 was correct. Then adding 0.0001 moles of NaOH. Let me confirm the moles again. Original solution1 had 0.0012 moles of CH3COOH and 0.0008 moles of CH3COO^-. Adding 0.0001 moles NaOH would consume 0.0001 moles of CH3COOH, yes. So new moles are correct. Then concentrations in 0.065 L. Yes. So pH2 is approximately 4.65.\n\nNow, solution3 is adding 5 cm³ of 0.02 M NaOH to 60 cm³ water. So total volume is 65 cm³, same as solution2? Wait, solution2 was 60 + 5 = 65 cm³. Solution3 is 5 + 60 = 65 cm³ as well. But solution3 is just NaOH diluted in water. So we need to find pH3 of this solution.\n\nFirst, moles of NaOH in solution3: 0.02 M * 0.005 L = 0.0001 moles. Then, total volume is 0.065 L. So concentration of NaOH is 0.0001 / 0.065 ≈ 0.001538 M.\n\nSince NaOH is a strong base, it dissociates completely, so [OH^-] = 0.001538 M.\n\nThen pOH = -log(0.001538) ≈ 2.812. Therefore pH3 = 14 - 2.812 ≈ 11.188.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the difference in pH levels between solution3 and solution2. So pH3 - pH2 = 11.188 - 4.65 ≈ 6.538. Which is approximately 6.54. Looking at the answer options, D is 6.55. So maybe that's the answer? But let me check my calculations again because I approximated several steps.\n\nLet me redo the exact calculations with more precision.\n\nFirst, let's recalculate the pH of solution1 more accurately.\n\nKa = 1.85×10⁻⁵. pKa = -log(1.85×10⁻⁵). Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: log(1.85) is approximately 0.2671717. Therefore pKa = 4.7328.\n\nSo pKa ≈ 4.7328.\n\nFor solution1:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.0012 / 0.06 = 0.02 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.0008 / 0.06 ≈ 0.013333 M.\n\nRatio [base]/[acid] = 0.013333 / 0.02 = 0.666666...\n\nlog(0.666666...) = log(2/3) ≈ -0.176091259.\n\nTherefore pH1 = 4.7328 - 0.17609 ≈ 4.5567. Let's say approximately 4.557.\n\nNow solution2: after adding 0.0001 moles NaOH.\n\nMoles CH3COOH: 0.0012 - 0.0001 = 0.0011 mol.\n\nMoles CH3COO^-: 0.0008 + 0.0001 = 0.0009 mol.\n\nVolume: 0.065 L.\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.0011 / 0.065 ≈ 0.016923 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.0009 / 0.065 ≈ 0.013846 M.\n\nRatio [base]/[acid] = 0.013846 / 0.016923 ≈ 0.81818.\n\nlog(0.81818). Let me calculate that more precisely.\n\nlog(0.81818) = ?\n\nWe know that log(0.8) = -0.09691, log(0.818) is between log(0.8) and log(0.82).\n\nLet me use linear approximation or better yet, use the formula.\n\nAlternatively, recall that log(0.818) can be calculated as follows.\n\nLet me use natural logarithm and then convert:\n\nln(0.818) ≈ -0.201 (exact value via calculator: ln(0.818) ≈ -0.2015). Then log(x) = ln(x)/ln(10) ≈ -0.2015 / 2.3026 ≈ -0.0875.\n\nSo pH2 = pKa + (-0.0875) ≈ 4.7328 - 0.0875 ≈ 4.6453. So approximately 4.645.\n\nNow solution3:\n\nMoles NaOH = 0.02 * 0.005 = 0.0001 mol.\n\nVolume = 0.065 L.\n\n[NaOH] = 0.0001 / 0.065 ≈ 0.00153846 M.\n\n[OH-] = 0.00153846 M.\n\npOH = -log(0.00153846). Let me calculate that.\n\nlog(0.00153846) = log(1.53846×10⁻³) = log(1.53846) + (-3). log(1.53846) ≈ 0.187. Therefore pOH ≈ -(-3 + 0.187) = 3 - 0.187 = 2.813. Therefore pH3 = 14 - 2.813 = 11.187.\n\nSo the difference pH3 - pH2 = 11.187 - 4.645 ≈ 6.542.\n\nLooking at the answer options:\n\nA:6.47 B:6.40 C:6.63 D:6.55\n\nSo approximately 6.54, which is closest to option D:6.55. Therefore, the answer should be D.\n\nBut let me check if there are any mistakes in my reasoning. For example, did I account for the dilution correctly?\n\nFor solution3: adding 5 cm³ of NaOH to 60 cm³ water. The concentration of NaOH is indeed 0.0001 / 0.065 ≈ 0.001538 M. Correct.\n\nFor solution2: the buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is applicable here because it's a buffer. Correct.\n\nWait, but in solution2, when adding NaOH to solution1, the volume changes. The concentrations of the acid and conjugate base are adjusted for the new volume. Which I did. So yes, the concentrations are calculated correctly.\n\nAnother thing: when I calculated the pKa, let me check with more precise calculation.\n\nKa = 1.85×10⁻⁵. Let me compute pKa using calculator-like steps.\n\npKa = -log(1.85×10⁻⁵). Let me use the exact value.\n\nLet me recall that log(1.8) is approximately 0.2553, log(1.85) is a bit higher. Let me use a calculator formula.\n\nAlternatively, since I might not have a calculator here, but maybe I can remember that log(1.85) ≈ 0.267 as before. So pKa ≈ 4.733. So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: the pH of solution3. 0.001538 M NaOH. [OH-] = 0.001538 M. pOH = 2.813, pH = 11.187. Correct.\n\npH difference ≈ 6.54. The options are given as 6.47, 6.40, 6.63, 6.55. So 6.55 is the closest. Therefore, answer D.\n\nBut let me check if perhaps in solution2 there's a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. For example, if I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nOriginal moles after adding NaOH:\n\nCH3COOH: 0.0011 mol\n\nCH3COO^-: 0.0009 mol\n\nVolume 0.065 L. So concentrations are 0.0011 / 0.065 and 0.0009 / 0.065. Let me compute them exactly:\n\n0.0011 / 0.065 = 0.0169230769 M\n\n0.0009 / 0.065 = 0.0138461538 M\n\nRatio is 0.0138461538 / 0.0169230769 ≈ 0.8181818...\n\nWhich is 9/11 ≈ 0.81818... because 0.0009 / 0.0011 = 9/11. So the ratio is 9/11. So log(9/11) = log(9) - log(11) ≈ 0.9542 - 1.0414 ≈ -0.0872. Which is what I had before. Therefore pH2 = 4.7328 - 0.0872 ≈ 4.6456. So pH2 ≈ 4.646.\n\npH3 is 11.187. Difference is 11.187 - 4.646 ≈ 6.541. So 6.54. The answer options have D as 6.55. Considering possible rounding differences during the steps, maybe the exact answer is 6.55. Let me check if there's a more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use more exact values for pKa.\n\nLet me calculate pKa with more precision. Given Ka = 1.85×10⁻⁵.\n\npKa = -log(1.85×10⁻⁵) = 5 - log(1.85). Let me compute log(1.85) more accurately.\n\nUsing logarithm tables or Taylor series? Alternatively, remember that log(1.85) can be calculated as follows:\n\nWe know that log(1.8) = 0.2553, log(1.85) is higher. Let me use linear approximation between log(1.8) and log(1.9).\n\nlog(1.8) = 0.2553\n\nlog(1.85) = ?\n\nThe derivative of log(x) is 1/(x ln10). At x=1.8, derivative is 1/(1.8 * 2.3026) ≈ 1/(4.1447) ≈ 0.241 per unit x. So from x=1.8 to x=1.85 is Δx=0.05. So approximate Δlog ≈ 0.05 * 0.241 ≈ 0.012. Therefore log(1.85) ≈ 0.2553 + 0.012 ≈ 0.2673. Which matches my prior value. Therefore pKa ≈ 4.7327. So pKa is approximately 4.7327.\n\nSo pH2 = 4.7327 + log(9/11) ≈ 4.7327 - 0.087 ≈ 4.6457.\n\npH3 is 11.187. Difference is 11.187 - 4.6457 = 6.5413. So approximately 6.54. The closest option is D:6.55. Depending on exact calculation steps, maybe there's a slight difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate pH3 with more precision. Let me check [OH-] in solution3.\n\n[OH-] = 0.0001 / 0.065 = 0.0015384615 M.\n\nCalculating pOH:\n\npOH = -log(0.0015384615). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me express 0.00153846 as 1.53846 × 10⁻³. Let me compute log(1.53846).\n\nWe know that log(1.5) = 0.1761, log(1.538) can be calculated.\n\nUsing logarithm approximation:\n\nlog(1.538) = ?\n\nWe know that log(1.5) = 0.1761\n\nlog(1.6) = 0.2040\n\nLet me use linear approximation between 1.5 and 1.6.\n\nThe value 1.538 is 0.038 above 1.5, over a range of 0.1 (from 1.5 to 1.6). Assuming linearity (which is an approximation), the increase in log would be (0.038 / 0.1) * (0.2040 - 0.1761) = 0.38 * 0.0279 ≈ 0.0106. Therefore log(1.538) ≈ 0.1761 + 0.0106 ≈ 0.1867. Therefore pOH = 3 - 0.1867 = 2.8133, so pH = 14 - 2.8133 = 11.1867. So pH3 ≈ 11.1867.\n\npH2 was calculated as 4.6457. Difference is 11.1867 - 4.6457 ≈ 6.541. So still approximately 6.54. Given that the options are to two decimal places, and the answer is likely expecting more precise calculation, perhaps using exact Henderson-Hasselbalch and exact pKa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the exact Ka value and not approximate pKa. Let me try solving solution2 without using Henderson-Hasselbalch, using the exact formula.\n\nFor a buffer solution, the pH can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nSo rearranged:\n\n[H+] = Ka * [HA]/[A-]\n\nSo in solution2:\n\n[HA] = 0.0011 / 0.065 ≈ 0.016923 M\n\n[A-] = 0.0009 / 0.065 ≈ 0.013846 M\n\nTherefore:\n\n[H+] = 1.85×10⁻⁵ * (0.016923 / 0.013846)\n\nCalculate the ratio 0.016923 / 0.013846 ≈ 1.2222 (since 9/11 is 0.818, reciprocal is ~1.222).\n\nSo [H+] = 1.85×10⁻⁵ * 1.222 ≈ 1.85 * 1.222 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ 2.2557 × 10⁻⁵.\n\nThen pH = -log(2.2557×10⁻⁵)\n\nCompute log(2.2557×10⁻⁵) = log(2.2557) + (-5). log(2.2557) ≈ 0.353. Therefore pH ≈ 5 - 0.353 = 4.647. Wait, no: log(2.2557×10⁻⁵) is log(2.2557) + log(10⁻⁵) = 0.353 - 5 = -4.647. Therefore pH = 4.647. Which matches our prior value of ~4.646. So pH2 ≈ 4.647.\n\nSo pH difference is 11.1867 - 4.647 ≈ 6.5397. So approximately 6.54. Still closest to D:6.55. But why is the answer not exactly 6.54? Maybe there's a more precise calculation somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the moles calculations? Let me check solution1 again.\n\nOriginal solution1: 20 cm³ of 0.1 M CH3COOH and 40 cm³ of 0.02 M NaOH.\n\nMoles CH3COOH: 0.02 L * 0.1 M = 0.002 mol. Correct.\n\nMoles NaOH: 0.04 L * 0.02 M = 0.0008 mol. Correct.\n\nReaction consumes 0.0008 mol of CH3COOH and produces 0.0008 mol of CH3COO^-.\n\nLeftover CH3COOH: 0.002 - 0.0008 = 0.0012 mol. Correct.\n\nYes. Then adding 5 cm³ of 0.02 M NaOH to solution1 (which is 60 cm³). The 5 cm³ is 0.005 L, so moles NaOH = 0.02 * 0.005 = 0.0001 mol. Correct. Reacts with 0.0001 mol of CH3COOH. So leftover CH3COOH: 0.0012 - 0.0001 = 0.0011 mol. Correct. Acetate becomes 0.0008 + 0.0001 = 0.0009 mol. Correct.\n\nSo calculations are correct. Therefore, the pH difference is approximately 6.54, which is very close to option D:6.55. Given that in multiple choice questions, sometimes rounding during steps can lead to slight differences. For example, if during the calculation of pKa, using more precise value could shift it slightly.\n\nLet me recalculate pKa with more precision. Let me use a calculator-like approach. Suppose I have Ka = 1.85×10⁻⁵. Let me compute pKa.\n\nUsing a calculator (pretending I have one here), log(1.85) is approximately:\n\nSince log(1.85) = ln(1.85)/ln(10). Let me approximate ln(1.85):\n\nWe know that ln(1.8) ≈ 0.5878, ln(1.9) ≈ 0.6419.\n\nLet me use Taylor series or linear approximation. Let me take ln(1.85). Let me approximate between 1.8 and 1.9.\n\nLet me assume that between x=1.8 and x=1.9, ln(x) can be approximated linearly.\n\nThe difference between x=1.8 and x=1.9 is 0.1. The difference in ln(x) is 0.6419 - 0.5878 = 0.0541 over 0.1 x. So derivative is approximately 0.541 per unit x. Wait, derivative of ln(x) is 1/x. At x=1.85, derivative is 1/1.85 ≈ 0.5405. So integrating, the linear approximation would be ln(1.8) + (1.85 - 1.8) * (1/1.8). Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, if we use the derivative at x=1.8, then ln(1.85) ≈ ln(1.8) + (0.05)*(1/1.8). Let me compute that.\n\nln(1.8) ≈ 0.5878\n\nApproximate ln(1.85) ≈ 0.5878 + 0.05*(1/1.8) ≈ 0.5878 + 0.05*(0.5556) ≈ 0.5878 + 0.0278 ≈ 0.6156. Actual value of ln(1.85) is approximately 0.6152 (if I recall, but this is just an example). Then log(1.85) = ln(1.85)/ln(10) ≈ 0.6152 / 2.3026 ≈ 0.2672. Therefore pKa = 5 - 0.2672 = 4.7328. So same as before. Therefore pKa is indeed approximately 4.7328.\n\nTherefore, no error there.\n\nAnother possible source of error: in solution3, assuming that the NaOH is completely dissociated and that activity coefficients are negligible. Which is a standard assumption in such problems.\n\nAnother check: let me calculate the exact [OH-] in solution3 and pH.\n\n[OH-] = 0.0001 / 0.065 = 0.00153846 M.\n\nLet me compute pOH more accurately.\n\nWe can use the exact formula:\n\npOH = -log10(0.00153846)\n\nLet me express 0.00153846 as 1.53846 × 10⁻³.\n\nLet me use the fact that log10(1.53846) = ?\n\nWe can note that 10^0.187 = 10^(0.1 + 0.08 + 0.007) ≈ 1.258 * 1.202 * 1.016 ≈ but this is too cumbersome.\n\nAlternatively, remember that log(1.5) = 0.1761, log(1.538) can be found by knowing that log(1.538) = log(1.5) + log(1.0253). Because 1.5 * 1.0253 ≈ 1.538.\n\nSo log(1.0253) ≈ 0.0109 (since log(1.02) ≈ 0.0086, log(1.03) ≈ 0.0128). So approximating log(1.0253) ≈ 0.0109. Therefore log(1.538) ≈ 0.1761 + 0.0109 ≈ 0.187. Therefore pOH = 3 - 0.187 = 2.813, pH = 14 - 2.813 = 11.187. Same as before.\n\nTherefore, the difference is indeed approximately 6.54. Given the answer options, D is 6.55. Considering that in precise calculation there might be a slight difference due to more accurate log values, but given the options, 6.55 is the closest. Hence, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
