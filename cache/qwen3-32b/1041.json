In this case, all of its gravitational potential energy is converted into **translational kinetic energy**. The entire mass accelerates uniformly down the incline, and the acceleration is simply:\n\n  $$\n  a_{\\text{block}} = g \\sin\\theta\n  $$\n\n- **The sphere**, however, **rolls without slipping**. This means that in addition to translational motion, it also has **rotational motion**. As a result, the gravitational potential energy is split between translational and rotational kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy of the rolling sphere is:\n\n  $$\n  K_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\n  $$\n\n  For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia is $ I = \\frac{2}{5}mr^2 $, and since $ \\omega = \\frac{v}{r} $, the rotational kinetic energy becomes:\n\n  $$\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}mr^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{v}{r}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{5}mv^2\n  $$\n\n  Therefore, the total kinetic energy is:\n\n  $$\n  K_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{5}mv^2 = \\frac{7}{10}mv^2\n  $$\n\n  This implies that the sphere does **not** convert all of its potential energy into translational motion, and so it reaches the bottom with **less translational speed** than the block.\n\n---\n\n### Acceleration Comparison\n\nUsing the principle of energy conservation and the relationship between kinetic energy and velocity, we can deduce the acceleration of the sphere is reduced due to the rotational component. The acceleration of the sphere is given by:\n\n$$\na_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{g \\sin\\theta}{1 + \\frac{I}{mr^2}} = \\frac{g \\sin\\theta}{1 + \\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{5}{7}g \\sin\\theta\n$$\n\nThis is **less than** the block's acceleration $ g \\sin\\theta $. Thus, the block accelerates more rapidly and reaches the bottom **before** the sphere.\n\n---\n\n### Eliminating Incorrect Choices\n\n- **A** is incorrect because the sphere **does** gain rotational kinetic energy, but that actually **reduces** its translational speed.\n- **B** is incorrect because the torque causes rotation, but it does **not** give the sphere additional mechanical energy.\n- **C** is incorrect because **both** objects conserve mechanical energy; the sphere doesn't lose energy due to static friction.\n- **D** is correct: the **block** reaches the bottom first because it **does not** gain rotational kinetic energy, while the **sphere** does. This means the block can convert all its potential energy into translational motion, resulting in a faster descent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I have this physics problem here about a sphere and a block sliding down an incline. Both have the same mass and are released from rest at the top. The sphere rolls without slipping, and the block slides without friction. The question is which one gets to the bottom first. The options are A to D. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when objects roll down an incline, they have both translational and rotational kinetic energy. Whereas if an object just slides without friction, all the potential energy is converted into translational kinetic energy. So, maybe that plays a role here. Let me recall the formulas.\n\nFor the block sliding without friction, the potential energy at the top, which is mgh (mass times gravity times height), gets converted entirely into translational kinetic energy, (1/2)mv². So, solving for velocity, we can say mgh = (1/2)mv², so v = sqrt(2gh). But wait, this is for a flat incline? Or does the angle matter? Hmm, actually, the velocity at the bottom would depend on the height, but since both objects are on the same incline, the height is the same. So maybe the block will have a higher speed?\n\nBut the sphere is rolling, so it has both translational and rotational kinetic energy. So the total kinetic energy for the sphere would be (1/2)mv² + (1/2)Iω², where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity. Since it's rolling without slipping, ω = v/r, where r is the radius. So substituting that in, the rotational kinetic energy becomes (1/2)I(v²/r²). \n\nFor a solid sphere, the moment of inertia is (2/5)mr². So plugging that in, the rotational KE is (1/2)*(2/5)mr²*(v²/r²) = (1/5)mv². So total kinetic energy for the sphere is (1/2)mv² + (1/5)mv² = (7/10)mv². \n\nSetting the potential energy equal to that: mgh = (7/10)mv². Solving for v gives v = sqrt(10gh/7). \n\nComparing that to the block's velocity, sqrt(2gh), which is bigger than sqrt(10gh/7) because 2 is about 2.0 and 10/7 is about 1.43. So sqrt(2gh) is larger. Therefore, the block has a higher final velocity. But wait, does that mean it gets to the bottom first? Not necessarily, because maybe the acceleration is different. Hmm, I need to think about acceleration, not just final velocity.\n\nWait, but if they both start from rest and go down the same incline, then the one with higher acceleration will reach the bottom first. But how do their accelerations compare?\n\nLet me think again. For the block sliding without friction, the acceleration down the incline is g*sinθ, where θ is the angle of the incline. Because the component of gravity along the incline is mg*sinθ, and since there's no friction, the acceleration is just that divided by mass, so a_block = g*sinθ.\n\nFor the sphere rolling down, the acceleration is less because some of the gravitational potential energy goes into rotational motion. The acceleration for a rolling object without slipping can be found by considering torque or using energy conservation with time. Let me recall the formula for acceleration of a rolling object. The acceleration a = g*sinθ / (1 + I/(mr²)). \n\nSince the moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5)mr², then I/(mr²) = 2/5. Therefore, a_sphere = g*sinθ / (1 + 2/5) = g*sinθ / (7/5) = (5/7)g*sinθ.\n\nComparing this to the block's acceleration of g*sinθ, the sphere's acceleration is (5/7) of the block's. Therefore, the block accelerates faster and will reach the bottom first. \n\nSo the answer should be either C or D. Let me check the options again:\n\nA: Sphere because it gains rotational KE but block does not. No, because sphere having rotational KE would mean it has less translational KE, so lower speed. So A is incorrect.\n\nB: Sphere because it gains mechanical energy due to torque. Wait, mechanical energy is conserved in both cases. The torque is what causes the rotation, but mechanical energy isn't gained; it's just converted into rotational and translational. So B is incorrect.\n\nC: Block because it doesn't lose mechanical energy due to friction, but the sphere does. Wait, the problem states that the sphere rolls without slipping, so there is static friction, but static friction does no work. The block slides without friction, so no energy loss. However, the sphere's mechanical energy is still conserved, right? Because static friction doesn't dissipate energy. So both have conserved mechanical energy. Therefore, C is incorrect because the sphere isn't losing mechanical energy. The reason the block gets there first is not because the sphere loses energy but because the sphere's energy is divided into rotation and translation. So maybe D is the right answer.\n\nD: Block because it does not gain rotational KE, but the sphere does. Yes, exactly. Since the sphere has to convert some energy into rotation, its translational speed is less, so it accelerates slower, so the block gets there first. Therefore, D is correct. The answer is D.\n\nBut let me make sure. The reasoning is that the block doesn't have rotational KE, so all the potential energy goes into translation, leading to higher acceleration. Therefore, D is correct. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
