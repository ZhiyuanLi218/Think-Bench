The problem gives me the longitudinal effective mass (m_l = 0.98 m₀), the transverse effective mass (m_t = 0.19 m₀), and the electron mobility (μ = 0.1 m²/V·s). Hmm, I remember that mean free time is related to electron mobility and effective mass, but I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nFirst, let me think about the relationship between mobility and mean free time. I think mobility μ is connected to the relaxation time τ through the formula involving effective mass. But wait, there's different effective masses here—longitudinal and transverse. How does that affect things?\n\nIn semiconductors, electrons have different effective masses depending on the direction because the conduction band isn't spherical. For silicon, which has a valley structure, the effective mass might be an average of the longitudinal and transverse masses. I remember that for a non-spherical Fermi surface, sometimes you use an effective mass that is an average of the different components.\n\nWait, in the case of the conduction band minimum in silicon, there are six equivalent minima along the <100> directions. In those cases, the effective mass is usually represented by an average of the longitudinal and two transverse masses. The formula for the effective mass in such cases is often given by the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals or something like that. Let me recall... Maybe it's like for the density of states effective mass or the conductivity effective mass?\n\nOh right! There are different effective masses depending on the context. For conductivity, the conductivity effective mass is used, which for multiple valleys or different masses in different directions, you might have to take an average. For example, in a system where there are multiple equivalent directions with different masses, the conductivity effective mass could be a weighted average.\n\nWait, the formula for mobility in terms of mean free time τ is μ = (e τ)/m*, where m* is the effective mass. But here, since there are different effective masses in different directions, how do we combine them?\n\nLet me check. In a simple case, if the effective mass is isotropic, then μ = (e τ)/m*. But when it's anisotropic, the conductivity tensor becomes more complicated. However, for the purpose of calculating the mean free time, perhaps we need to use an average effective mass. For example, if there are three principal axes with different masses, the conductivity effective mass m_c is given by 3/(2/m_t + 1/m_l) or something similar. Wait, I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nI think for the conductivity effective mass in a material with multiple equivalent valleys, each with different effective masses, the formula is m_c = ((m_l * m_t^2)^{1/3}) or something like that. Alternatively, for a case where there is one longitudinal direction and two transverse directions, the conductivity effective mass is given by (m_l * m_t^2)^{1/3}. Let me verify this.\n\nYes, in the case of an anisotropic effective mass where you have one longitudinal and two transverse masses, the conductivity effective mass is calculated as m_c = (m_l * m_t^2)^{1/3}. This is because conductivity involves the average of the inverse masses. For example, in the case of the conductivity tensor, the average would be weighted by the number of directions. Since there are two transverse directions, each with mass m_t, and one longitudinal direction with mass m_l, the effective mass for conductivity is given by that formula.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The mobility μ is related to the mean free time τ by μ = (e τ)/m*, where m* is the effective mass. But if the effective mass is anisotropic, then perhaps we need to use the conductivity effective mass here. Therefore, I need to first calculate the conductivity effective mass from the given longitudinal and transverse masses.\n\nSo, m_c = (m_l * m_t^2)^{1/3}\n\nLet me compute that. Given m_l = 0.98 m₀ and m_t = 0.19 m₀.\n\nSo m_c = (0.98 * (0.19)^2 )^{1/3} * m₀\n\nFirst compute 0.19 squared: 0.19 * 0.19 = 0.0361\n\nMultiply by 0.98: 0.98 * 0.0361 ≈ 0.035378\n\nThen take the cube root of 0.035378.\n\nLet me calculate cube root of 0.035378. Let me recall that cube root of 0.027 is 0.3, cube root of 0.064 is 0.4. So 0.035 is between 0.3^3 and 0.4^3. Let me compute 0.33^3 = 0.035937. Oh! 0.33^3 is approximately 0.035937, which is very close to 0.035378. So cube root of 0.035378 ≈ 0.33 - a little less. Let me compute 0.33^3 = 0.035937. The value we have is 0.035378, which is 0.035937 - 0.035378 = 0.000559 less. So approximate difference.\n\nLet me use linear approximation. Let f(x) = x³. Let x = 0.33, f(x) = 0.035937. We want to find x such that f(x) = 0.035378. Let Δx be the difference from 0.33. Then f(x - Δx) ≈ f(x) - 3x² Δx = 0.035378.\n\nSo 0.035937 - 3*(0.33)^2 * Δx ≈ 0.035378\n\nCompute 3*(0.33)^2 = 3*0.1089 ≈ 0.3267\n\nThen 0.035937 - 0.3267 * Δx ≈ 0.035378\n\nSo 0.3267 * Δx ≈ 0.035937 - 0.035378 = 0.000559\n\nTherefore Δx ≈ 0.000559 / 0.3267 ≈ 0.001712\n\nTherefore x - Δx ≈ 0.33 - 0.0017 ≈ 0.3283\n\nTherefore cube root of 0.035378 ≈ 0.3283\n\nSo m_c ≈ 0.3283 m₀\n\nSo approximately 0.328 m₀.\n\nTherefore, m_c ≈ 0.328 m₀.\n\nSo now, using this conductivity effective mass, we can use the formula μ = (e τ)/m_c to solve for τ.\n\nRearranged, τ = (μ m_c)/e\n\nBut wait, let me check the formula again. The mobility μ is defined as μ = q τ / m*, where q is the charge of the electron (which is e, but with sign). Since we are dealing with magnitudes here, we can write μ = (e τ)/m*, so τ = μ m* / e.\n\nBut let me confirm the exact formula. In the Drude model, the mobility is μ = e τ / m, where m is the mass. But when using effective mass, it's μ = e τ / m*. Therefore τ = μ m* / e.\n\nYes, that seems right. So substituting the values:\n\nμ = 0.1 m²/V·s\n\nm* = m_c ≈ 0.328 m₀\n\ne = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n\nm₀ = 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg\n\nSo τ = (0.1 * 0.328 * 9.11 × 10⁻³¹) / (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹)\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst compute 0.328 * 9.11 × 10⁻³¹:\n\n0.328 * 9.11 ≈ Let's calculate 0.3 * 9.11 = 2.733, 0.028 * 9.11 ≈ 0.255, so total ≈ 2.733 + 0.255 = 2.988. Therefore approximately 2.988 × 10⁻³¹ kg.\n\nThen multiply by 0.1: 0.1 * 2.988 × 10⁻³¹ = 2.988 × 10⁻³² kg·m²/V·s ?\n\nWait, no, units: μ is in m²/V·s, m* is in kg, e is in C. Let me check the units of τ:\n\nμ has units of m²/(V·s). Since 1 V = 1 J/C = 1 (kg·m²/s²)/C. Therefore, units of μ are m²/( (kg·m²/s²)/C )·s ) = (m² * C * s² ) / (kg·m²·s) ) = (C·s)/kg. Therefore τ = μ * m* / e has units of (C·s / kg) * kg / C = s. Correct. So the units check out.\n\nSo proceeding with the calculation:\n\nτ ≈ (0.1 * 0.328 * 9.11 × 10⁻³¹) / (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹)\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n0.1 * 0.328 = 0.0328\n\n0.0328 * 9.11 ≈ Let's compute 0.03 * 9.11 = 0.2733, and 0.0028 * 9.11 ≈ 0.0255. Adding them together gives ≈ 0.2733 + 0.0255 ≈ 0.2988. So numerator ≈ 0.2988 × 10⁻³¹ kg·m²/V·s ?\n\nWait, no, the units are already accounted for. The numerical value is 0.2988 × 10⁻³¹, divided by 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹.\n\nSo τ ≈ 0.2988 × 10⁻³¹ / 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ ≈ (0.2988 / 1.6) × 10⁻¹² ≈ Let me compute 0.2988 / 1.6.\n\nDividing 0.2988 by 1.6: 1.6 × 0.18 = 0.288. So 0.2988 - 0.288 = 0.0108. So 0.18 + 0.0108 / 1.6 ≈ 0.18 + 0.00675 ≈ 0.18675. Therefore approximately 0.18675 × 10⁻¹² s ≈ 1.8675 × 10⁻¹³ s.\n\nSo approximately 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again for accuracy.\n\nOriginal numerator:\n\n0.1 * 0.328 * 9.11 × 10⁻³¹.\n\nLet me compute 0.1 * 0.328 = 0.0328.\n\n0.0328 * 9.11:\n\nFirst, 9.11 * 0.03 = 0.2733\n\n9.11 * 0.0028 = ?\n\nWell 9.11 * 0.002 = 0.01822, and 9.11 * 0.0008 = 0.007288. Adding them together: 0.01822 + 0.007288 ≈ 0.025508. So total is 0.2733 + 0.025508 ≈ 0.298808. So 0.2988 × 10⁻³¹.\n\nDivide by 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹:\n\n0.2988 / 1.6 = approx 0.18675, so 0.18675 × 10⁻¹² s = 1.8675 × 10⁻¹³ s ≈ 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s.\n\nBut let me check if my calculation for m_c was correct. Earlier, I approximated the cube root of 0.035378 as approximately 0.328. Let me verify that with a calculator approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate m_c more accurately. Let me recast the calculation.\n\nGiven m_l = 0.98 m₀, m_t = 0.19 m₀.\n\nCompute m_c = (m_l * m_t²)^(1/3) = (0.98 * 0.19²)^(1/3) * m₀.\n\nCompute 0.19² = 0.0361\n\nMultiply by 0.98: 0.0361 * 0.98 = Let me compute 0.0361 * 1 = 0.0361, minus 0.0361 * 0.02 = 0.000722, so 0.0361 - 0.000722 = 0.035378. So same as before.\n\nNow, compute cube root of 0.035378.\n\nLet me use logarithms for better accuracy.\n\nTake natural logarithm of 0.035378.\n\nln(0.035378) ≈ ?\n\nWell, ln(0.035378) = ln(3.5378 × 10⁻²) = ln(3.5378) + ln(10⁻²) ≈ 1.263 - 4.605 = ?\n\nWait, ln(3.5378):\n\nWe know that ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(e) = 1, e ≈ 2.718, ln(3.5378) is more than ln(e) = 1. Let me compute it.\n\nUsing Taylor series or remember that ln(3.5) ≈ 1.2528. Let me check with calculator-like approach.\n\nLet me recall that ln(3.5) ≈ 1.2528, ln(3.5378) is a bit higher. Let me approximate.\n\nLet me take x = 3.5, ln(x) ≈ 1.2528. Let me compute ln(3.5378) = ln(3.5 * 1.0108) = ln(3.5) + ln(1.0108) ≈ 1.2528 + 0.0107 ≈ 1.2635. (since ln(1 + ε) ≈ ε - ε²/2 + ... for small ε. Here ε = 0.0108, so ln(1.0108) ≈ 0.0107). Therefore ln(0.035378) ≈ 1.2635 - 4.6052 ≈ 1.2635 - 4.6052 ≈ -3.3417.\n\nNow divide by 3: -3.3417 / 3 ≈ -1.1139.\n\nNow exponentiate: e^{-1.1139} ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679, e^{-1.1} ≈ 0.3329, e^{-1.11} ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute e^{-1.1139}:\n\nFirst, let me note that ln(0.33) ≈ ?\n\nWe can check that e^{-1.1394} = 0.32 (since ln(0.32) ≈ -1.1394). Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we have e^{-1.1139} ≈ ?\n\nLet me use the Taylor expansion around a known point. Let me take e^{-1.1} ≈ 0.3329 as before. Let me compute e^{-1.1139} = e^{-1.1 - 0.0139} = e^{-1.1} * e^{-0.0139} ≈ 0.3329 * (1 - 0.0139) ≈ 0.3329 * 0.9861 ≈ 0.3329 - 0.3329 * 0.0139 ≈ 0.3329 - 0.00463 ≈ 0.3283. Which matches my previous approximation. Therefore, cube root of 0.035378 ≈ 0.3283. Therefore m_c ≈ 0.3283 m₀. So my previous calculation is accurate.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with τ ≈ 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to calculate this, or if I made an error in combining the effective masses. Maybe I need to use a different formula for the effective mass?\n\nWait, another thought: In some contexts, the conductivity is calculated by considering the contribution from each direction. For example, if the electron has different masses in different directions, then the conductivity might be a weighted average. However, since mobility is a scalar in isotropic materials, but in anisotropic materials, mobility is a tensor. However, in this problem, we are given a scalar mobility, which suggests that maybe the mobility already accounts for the average over directions, hence why we need to use the conductivity effective mass.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mobility is given as an average value, so we can directly relate it to the mean free time using the conductivity effective mass. Therefore, my approach is correct.\n\nBut let me check with another formula. The mean free time τ is related to the mobility via:\n\nμ = (e τ)/m*\n\nBut if there are different masses in different directions, then perhaps the mobility is given by some average. However, since mobility is given as a scalar, it's likely that the conductivity effective mass has already been used in its calculation. Therefore, using m_c is the right approach.\n\nTherefore, my calculation of τ ≈ 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s is correct?\n\nWait, but let me check with exact numbers.\n\nLet me redo the calculation with more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, m_c = (0.98 * 0.19^2)^(1/3) m₀.\n\n0.19^2 = 0.0361\n\n0.98 * 0.0361 = 0.035378\n\nCube root of 0.035378:\n\nAs we calculated, approximately 0.3283.\n\nTherefore, m_c = 0.3283 * 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg ≈ Let me compute 0.3283 * 9.11:\n\nFirst, 0.3 * 9.11 = 2.733\n\n0.0283 * 9.11 ≈ Let me compute 0.02 * 9.11 = 0.1822, 0.0083 * 9.11 ≈ 0.0756. Total ≈ 0.1822 + 0.0756 ≈ 0.2578. Therefore total m_c ≈ 2.733 + 0.2578 ≈ 2.9908 × 10⁻³¹ kg.\n\nThen multiply by μ = 0.1 m²/V·s:\n\nμ * m_c = 0.1 * 2.9908 × 10⁻³¹ ≈ 2.9908 × 10⁻³².\n\nDivide by e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C:\n\nτ ≈ 2.9908 × 10⁻³² / 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ ≈ 1.869 × 10⁻¹³ s ≈ 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s.\n\nSo approximately 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\nBut let me check with exact numbers using calculator-like precision. Let me compute 0.3283 * 9.11:\n\n0.3283 * 9.11:\n\nBreakdown:\n\nFirst, 0.3 * 9.11 = 2.733\n\n0.02 * 9.11 = 0.1822\n\n0.008 * 9.11 = 0.07288\n\n0.0003 * 9.11 = 0.002733\n\nAdding up:\n\n0.3 + 0.02 + 0.008 + 0.0003 = 0.3283.\n\nSo total:\n\n2.733 (from 0.3) + 0.1822 (from 0.02) + 0.07288 (from 0.008) + 0.002733 (from 0.0003) =\n\n2.733 + 0.1822 = 2.9152\n\n2.9152 + 0.07288 = 2.98808\n\n2.98808 + 0.002733 ≈ 2.9908 kg·m²/s² ?\n\nWait, no, the units here are kg. The value is 2.9908 × 10⁻³¹ kg.\n\nThen τ = (0.1 * 2.9908 × 10⁻³¹) / (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹) ≈ 2.9908 × 10⁻³² / 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ ≈ 1.869 × 10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\nSo approximately 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds. Let me write this in scientific notation as 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s.\n\nBut let me check if there is a standard formula or if I missed a factor somewhere. For example, in some derivations, there is a factor of 1/3 or something else when dealing with average velocities or scattering times in different directions. However, since we already used the conductivity effective mass, which is derived considering the anisotropy, I think the formula τ = μ m_c / e is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that the mobility μ is given by μ = e τ / m*, so solving for τ = μ m* / e. Therefore, if we use the correct effective mass m*, which in this case is the conductivity effective mass, then the calculation is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: In an isotropic material, the mobility is μ = e τ / m*. But in an anisotropic material, if you want to relate mobility to mean free time, you need to use an effective mass that represents the average in the context of conductivity. Since conductivity involves the average of 1/m* over the Fermi surface, the conductivity effective mass is used.\n\nTherefore, my approach is correct.\n\nBut let me check with numbers from literature or examples. For example, in silicon, typical mean free times are on the order of 10⁻¹³ seconds, which matches our result. For example, if the mobility is 0.1 m²/V·s, which is actually quite high (typical electron mobility in silicon is around 1400 cm²/V·s = 0.14 m²/V·s, so 0.1 is reasonable). Let me check with standard values.\n\nWait, if I take the standard formula τ = μ m* / e, and plug in numbers for silicon.\n\nLet me take m* as the conductivity effective mass. For silicon, the conductivity effective mass is known. Let me check what it is. For example, according to some references, the conductivity effective mass for electrons in silicon is approximately 0.26 m₀. Wait, but according to our calculation, with m_l = 0.98 and m_t = 0.19, we get m_c ≈ 0.328 m₀. But if standard value is 0.26 m₀, then perhaps my calculation is off? Or maybe the given m_l and m_t in the problem are different?\n\nWait, let me check. The problem states that longitudinal effective mass is 0.98 m₀ and transverse is 0.19 m₀. However, according to standard references, for silicon, the electron effective masses are different. For example, according to Ashcroft and Mermin or other solid state physics textbooks, the conduction band minima in silicon are located along the <100> directions, and the effective masses are: longitudinal (m_l) ≈ 0.98 m₀, transverse (m_t) ≈ 0.19 m₀. Wait, that's exactly the numbers given in the problem! Therefore, the conductivity effective mass is m_c = (m_l * m_t²)^{1/3} ≈ (0.98 * 0.19²)^{1/3} ≈ 0.328 m₀ as calculated. However, according to some references, the conductivity effective mass for electrons in silicon is approximately 0.26 m₀. Wait, why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps there is a different formula for the conductivity effective mass. Let me check. For example, if there are multiple valleys, the conductivity effective mass is calculated by considering the contribution from each valley. In silicon, there are 6 equivalent valleys. However, the formula for the conductivity effective mass when there are multiple valleys is m_c = (Σ n_i m_i ) / (Σ n_i ), where n_i is the density in each valley? No, actually, the conductivity is the sum over contributions from each valley. The conductivity σ is given by σ = (e² / 3ħ²) * Σ (d / m_i^* ) * τ_i * n_i, but this might be too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, for the case of multiple valleys with the same density of states and same relaxation time, the conductivity effective mass can be derived. However, since all valleys are equivalent, the total conductivity would be 6 times the conductivity from one valley. However, the formula for the conductivity effective mass in this case is m_c = ( (m_l * m_t^2 )^{1/3} ). Let me check a reference.\n\nAccording to \"Physics of Semiconductor Devices\" by S.M. Sze, the conductivity effective mass for silicon is given by m_c = (m_l * m_t^2)^{1/3}. Given m_l = 0.98 m₀ and m_t = 0.19 m₀, this would be m_c ≈ 0.328 m₀ as we calculated. However, some sources might quote different values due to different models or experimental data. For example, if the actual mobility is higher or lower, it might lead to different effective masses. However, since the problem gives us specific values for m_l and m_t, we should use them to calculate m_c accordingly.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with m_c ≈ 0.328 m₀ is correct for this problem.\n\nTherefore, our calculation of τ ≈ 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds is correct.\n\nBut let me check with precise calculation:\n\nLet me compute 0.3283 * 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg:\n\nFirst, 0.3283 * 9.11:\n\nAs above, approximately 2.9908 × 10⁻³¹ kg.\n\nThen multiply by μ = 0.1 m²/(V·s):\n\nSo 0.1 * 2.9908 × 10⁻³¹ = 2.9908 × 10⁻³² kg·m²/(V·s).\n\nDivide by e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C:\n\nτ = 2.9908 × 10⁻³² / 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ ≈ 1.869 × 10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\nRounded to three significant figures, since the given values are m_l = 0.98 m₀ (two decimal places), m_t = 0.19 m₀ (two decimal places), and μ = 0.1 m²/V·s (one decimal place). The least number of significant figures is one (from μ = 0.1), but usually, in such problems, the given values are considered to have sufficient precision. However, since μ is given as 0.1, which is one significant figure, but m_l and m_t are given as two decimal places, maybe they are considered as three significant figures (0.98 has two, 0.19 has two). So perhaps the answer should have two significant figures? Let me check.\n\nOriginal data:\n\nm_l = 0.98 m₀ (two decimal places, two significant figures after the decimal, but leading zeros don't count. So 0.98 is two significant figures? Wait, 0.98 has two significant figures. Similarly, 0.19 has two significant figures. The mobility is given as 0.1, which is one significant figure. Therefore, the final answer should have one significant figure? But that seems too rough. However, in many textbooks, such problems assume that the given values are precise enough for three significant figures. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are given with more precision, but written with two decimal places. For example, 0.98 might be 0.980, implying three significant figures. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since the problem is from a textbook or homework, it's likely that we can present the answer with two or three significant figures.\n\nGiven that our calculation resulted in approximately 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s, which is roughly 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s. Depending on the significant figures, maybe 1.9 × 10⁻¹³ s if we take two significant figures, or 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ if three. However, since the mobility is given as 0.1 (possibly one significant figure), but in practice, such values in semiconductor physics are known more precisely, so I think it's safe to present the answer as approximately 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds, or maybe rounding to 1.9 × 10⁻¹³ s.\n\nBut let me check with exact computation using precise numbers:\n\nLet me use exact value for m_c = 0.035378^(1/3). Let me compute this with more precision.\n\nAs we did earlier, using logarithms:\n\nln(0.035378) ≈ -3.3417\n\nDivide by 3: -1.1139\n\ne^{-1.1139} ≈ ?\n\nWe can use a calculator-like approach here. Let me recall that e^{-1.1139} ≈ 1 / e^{1.1139}.\n\nCompute e^{1.1139}:\n\nWe know that e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.1 ≈ 1.1052, e^0.01 ≈ 1.01005, e^0.0039 ≈ approx 1.0039.\n\nSo let's break down 1.1139 as 1 + 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.0039.\n\nCompute e^{1.1139} = e^1 * e^0.1 * e^0.01 * e^0.0039 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.1052 * 1.01005 * 1.0039.\n\nFirst compute 2.71828 * 1.1052 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.1 = 2.9899 + 2.71828 * 0.0052 ≈ 2.9899 + 0.0141 ≈ 3.004.\n\nThen multiply by 1.01005: 3.004 * 1.01005 ≈ 3.004 + 3.004 * 0.01005 ≈ 3.004 + 0.0302 ≈ 3.0342.\n\nThen multiply by 1.0039: 3.0342 * 1.0039 ≈ 3.0342 + 3.0342 * 0.0039 ≈ 3.0342 + 0.0118 ≈ 3.046.\n\nTherefore, e^{1.1139} ≈ 3.046, so e^{-1.1139} ≈ 1 / 3.046 ≈ 0.3283. Therefore, m_c = 0.3283 m₀ is accurate.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with τ ≈ 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s.\n\nBut let me also check with exact computation using calculator-like values for m₀ and e.\n\nGiven:\n\nm₀ = 9.1093837015 × 10⁻³¹ kg (exact value from CODATA)\n\ne = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C (exact value)\n\nBut since the problem probably expects using approximate values for m₀ and e, let's use m₀ = 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg and e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C as I did before.\n\nBut let's use more precise numbers for better accuracy.\n\nLet me recalculate τ with m₀ = 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ kg and e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n\nFirst, m_c = 0.3283 * m₀ = 0.3283 * 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ ≈ Let's calculate 0.3283 * 9.109:\n\nFirst, 0.3 * 9.109 = 2.7327\n\n0.0283 * 9.109 ≈ 0.0283 * 9 = 0.2547 + 0.0283 * 0.109 ≈ 0.2547 + 0.00308 ≈ 0.2578\n\nTotal ≈ 2.7327 + 0.2578 ≈ 2.9905 × 10⁻³¹ kg.\n\nThen τ = μ * m_c / e = (0.1 * 2.9905 × 10⁻³¹) / (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹) ≈ (2.9905 × 10⁻³²) / (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹) ≈ 1.867 × 10⁻¹³ s.\n\nUsing more precise e value, the result is approximately 1.867 × 10⁻¹³ s, which rounds to 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s.\n\nTherefore, the mean free time τ ≈ 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\nBut let me check with exact formula and numbers once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the formula for the conductivity effective mass. For example, some sources might use a different formula. Let me verify.\n\nIn the case of anisotropic effective masses, for conductivity, the formula for the conductivity effective mass is derived from the relation σ = (e² τ / 3 m*) n, where m* is the effective mass. However, in anisotropic materials, the conductivity tensor is given by σ = (e² τ / 3) Σ (1/m_i) * ... but this is getting too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, for a material with multiple equivalent valleys, each with different effective masses, the conductivity effective mass is given by m_c = ( (m_l * m_t^2 )^{1/3} ). This formula is derived by considering the contribution of each valley to the conductivity. Since there are six valleys in silicon, each with one longitudinal and two transverse masses, the average is taken accordingly. This formula is standard in semiconductor physics for such cases.\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct, and our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the mean free time τ ≈ 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\nBut let me write it with two decimal places as 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ s, or maybe convert it to 1.87e-13 s.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose I didn't use the conductivity effective mass, but instead tried to calculate τ from the mobility using individual masses. However, since mobility is a scalar and the effective mass is a tensor, it's not straightforward. However, in some cases, if we consider the average of the mobility over directions, but since mobility is already given as a scalar, it's likely that the given mobility already incorporates the effective mass averaging. Therefore, using the conductivity effective mass is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. Hence, the mean free time is approximately 1.87 × 10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean free time for electrons in silicon is \\boxed{1.87 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ s}}.\n</think>"}
