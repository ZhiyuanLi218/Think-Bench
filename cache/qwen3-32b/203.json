So, the question is about what happens to the image of the coin when the lens is moved from 0.3 meters above it to 0.1 meters above it. The focal length of the lens is 0.2 meters. The options are about whether the image size increases, decreases, flips, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts about convex lenses. Convex lenses are converging lenses, right? Depending on the position of the object relative to the focal length, the image formed can be real or virtual, inverted or upright, magnified or diminished. \n\nThe formula for the lens is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, where f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance. Wait, actually, I think the sign conventions can vary depending on the convention used. In the standard sign convention for optics, distances for real objects and images are positive, and for virtual objects or images, they are negative. But I need to be careful here. \n\nLet me confirm the lens formula. The standard formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, but I might be mixing up the sign conventions. Wait, no, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u if we are using the Cartesian sign convention where distances to real images are positive and object distances are negative. Wait, this is confusing. Let me get this straight.\n\nIn the Cartesian sign convention, the object distance (u) is negative if the object is on the same side as the incoming light. For a convex lens, the object is usually placed on the left side, so u is negative. The focal length for a convex lens is positive. Then the image distance (v) can be positive (real image on the opposite side) or negative (virtual image on the same side as the object). \n\nBut maybe I should use the formula as 1/f = 1/v + 1/u with proper signs. Let me check. For example, if the object is at distance u from the lens (positive if on the left side), then the image distance v is calculated accordingly. Wait, actually, different textbooks use different conventions. Let me stick to one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use the formula with absolute values and consider the positions. Let me think.\n\nGiven that the focal length f is 0.2 m. The object is moved from 0.3 m to 0.1 m from the lens. Wait, but the problem says \"the lens is held a distance 0.3 m above the coin and is moved slowly to a distance of 0.1 m above the coin.\" So the object distance (u) is changing from 0.3 m to 0.1 m. However, in the lens formula, the object distance is measured from the object to the lens. For a real object, u is positive in some conventions. Wait, confusion arises here again.\n\nLet me recall the standard formula. In the standard convention where all distances are measured from the lens, object distance (u) is positive if the object is on the side of the lens from which the light is coming. Since the coin is on the table and the lens is held above it, assuming that we are dealing with light coming from the right (as in typical diagrams), but maybe it's better to just take u as positive when the object is in front of the lens. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the formula 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, where u is the object distance measured from the lens to the object (positive if the object is in front of the lens, i.e., on the side from which the light is coming), and v is the image distance from the lens to the image (positive if on the opposite side). So for a convex lens, f is positive.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, when the lens is held at 0.3 m above the coin, so u = 0.3 m. The focal length f = 0.2 m. Let's compute the image distance v.\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u => 1/v = 1/f + 1/u.\n\nWait, no, if 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, then rearranged, 1/v = 1/f + 1/u? Wait, that can't be. Let me do the algebra again.\n\nStarting from 1/f = 1/v - 1/u.\n\nThen adding 1/u to both sides: 1/f + 1/u = 1/v.\n\nTherefore, 1/v = 1/f + 1/u. Wait, but that seems like the formula for a mirror? Wait, no, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me check again.\n\nThe correct lens formula is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u. So if I have that, then solving for 1/v gives 1/f + 1/u. So, 1/v = 1/f + 1/u. But if the object is at u = 0.3 m, and f = 0.2 m, then:\n\n1/v = 1/0.2 + 1/0.3 = 5 + 10/3 ≈ 5 + 3.333 = 8.333 m⁻¹. Therefore, v ≈ 1/8.333 ≈ 0.12 m. Wait, that would be 0.12 m on which side? Since v is positive, it's on the opposite side of the lens from the object, meaning a real image.\n\nBut wait, if the object is placed beyond the focal length (u > f), then the image is real and inverted. However, when the object is between the focal length and the lens (u < f), the image becomes virtual, upright, and magnified. \n\nSo initially, when the object is at 0.3 m from the lens, which is greater than the focal length of 0.2 m, so u > f, so image is real, inverted, and located at v ≈ 0.12 m. \n\nThen, when the lens is moved closer to the coin, so u decreases from 0.3 m to 0.1 m. So when u = 0.1 m, which is less than f (0.2 m), then the image becomes virtual. Let's compute v in that case.\n\n1/v = 1/f + 1/u = 1/0.2 + 1/0.1 = 5 + 10 = 15 m⁻¹. Therefore, v = 1/15 ≈ 0.0667 m. Wait, but if the object is inside the focal length, the image should be virtual, so v should be negative? Maybe I messed up the sign convention here.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial formula is wrong. Let me check the correct lens formula again. The correct formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, with the sign convention that for real objects, u is positive, for real images, v is positive. Wait, but different conventions exist. For example, in the convention where object distance is positive for real objects, image distance is positive for real images (on the opposite side), and negative for virtual images (on the same side as the object). \n\nSo, let's take that formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. \n\nWait, if that's the case, then for a convex lens, when the object is outside the focal length, the image is real (v positive), and when the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual (v negative). \n\nLet me recast the formula. So 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Let's solve for 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. \n\nWait, no. If the formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, then rearranged, 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. \n\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me think again. If it's 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, then 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. \n\nBut in the previous example, when u = 0.3 m and f = 0.2 m, then 1/v = 1/0.2 - 1/0.3 = 5 - 3.333... = 1.666..., so v = 1 / 1.666... ≈ 0.6 m. Wait, that's different from before. So earlier I had a different formula. \n\nThis is confusing. I need to get this straight. Let me look up the correct lens formula. \n\nThe lens formula is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, where u is the object distance, v is the image distance, and f is the focal length. The sign convention is such that for a real object, u is negative (in the Cartesian convention), because the object is on the left side of the lens (assuming light is traveling from left to right). For a convex lens, f is positive. \n\nWait, maybe I need to use the Cartesian sign convention. Let's try that.\n\nIn Cartesian sign convention:\n\n- All distances are measured from the optical center of the lens.\n\n- Distances to real objects are negative (since they are on the left side, where the light is coming from).\n\n- Distances to real images are positive (on the right side).\n\n- Distances to virtual images are negative (on the left side).\n\n- Focal length for convex lens is positive.\n\nSo, the formula is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u.\n\nGiven that, let's redo the calculations.\n\nFirst case: object at u = -0.3 m (since it's on the left side), f = +0.2 m.\n\nSo 1/f = 1/v - 1/u => 1/0.2 = 1/v - 1/(-0.3) => 5 = 1/v + 1/0.3 => 5 = 1/v + 10/3 ≈ 3.333...\n\nSo 1/v = 5 - 10/3 = (15/3 - 10/3) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666...\n\nTherefore, v = 3/5 = 0.6 m. Positive, so the image is on the right side, real, and inverted.\n\nThen, when the object is moved to u = -0.1 m (closer to the lens), so:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u => 1/0.2 = 1/v - 1/(-0.1) => 5 = 1/v + 1/0.1 => 5 = 1/v + 10 => 1/v = 5 - 10 = -5 => v = -1/5 = -0.2 m.\n\nSo the image is at -0.2 m, meaning on the left side of the lens, virtual, upright.\n\nSo, during the movement from u = -0.3 m to u = -0.1 m, the image changes from real (v = +0.6 m) to virtual (v = -0.2 m). \n\nNow, the question is about the size of the image. The magnification m is given by m = v/u (in Cartesian convention). Wait, since u is negative and v can be positive or negative.\n\nSo for the first case, m = v/u = 0.6 / (-0.3) = -2. So magnification is -2, meaning inverted and magnified by 2x.\n\nIn the second case, m = v/u = (-0.2)/(-0.1) = 2. So magnification is +2, meaning upright and magnified by 2x.\n\nSo initially, the image is inverted and 2x larger, then when the lens is moved closer, the image becomes upright and 2x larger. Wait, but the question is about the size. The magnitudes are the same? Wait, but that seems odd. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nFirst case: u = -0.3 m, v = +0.6 m. Magnification m = v/u = 0.6 / (-0.3) = -2. So the image is twice as big as the object, inverted.\n\nSecond case: u = -0.1 m, v = -0.2 m. Magnification m = (-0.2)/(-0.1) = 2. So image is twice as big, upright.\n\nSo in both cases, the magnification magnitude is 2. But what about when the lens is moved from 0.3 m to 0.1 m? Is the magnification always 2? That seems unlikely. Maybe I need to check at some intermediate position.\n\nLet me take an intermediate position, say u = -0.25 m. Let's compute v.\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u => 1/0.2 = 1/v - 1/(-0.25) => 5 = 1/v + 4 => 1/v = 5 - 4 = 1 => v = 1 m.\n\nThen magnification m = v/u = 1 / (-0.25) = -4. Wait, that's a magnification of -4? That would mean the image is four times larger? But if the object is moving from 0.3 m to 0.1 m, when it's at 0.25 m, the magnification is -4? That seems like the image is getting larger as the object approaches the focal length?\n\nWait, but when the object is at u = -0.2 m (which is equal to the focal length), then:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u => 5 = 1/v - 1/(-0.2) => 5 = 1/v + 5 => 1/v = 0 => v approaches infinity. So when the object is at the focal length, the image is at infinity.\n\nSo, when moving from u = -0.3 m (twice the focal length) to u approaching -0.2 m (focal length), the image distance v increases from 0.6 m to infinity. The magnification m = v/u. Let's see, when u is -0.3 m, m = -2. When u approaches -0.2 m, v approaches infinity, so m approaches infinity / 0.2 (but since u is negative, it's -infinity?), but in reality, as u approaches -0.2 m from the left (i.e., u approaching -0.2 from more negative values?), wait, no. If u is moving from -0.3 to -0.1, so approaching -0.2 from the left (more negative) to the right (less negative). Wait, actually, when moving from u = -0.3 m to u = -0.1 m, the object is moving towards the lens, so u is becoming less negative.\n\nSo when the object is at u = -0.3 m, m = -2. When moving closer to the lens, say u = -0.25 m, m = -4. When moving to u = -0.2 m, m approaches infinity. Then, when the object is just beyond the focal length, say u = -0.21 m, let's compute v.\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u => 5 = 1/v - 1/(-0.21) => 5 = 1/v + 4.7619 => 1/v = 5 - 4.7619 ≈ 0.238 => v ≈ 4.2 m. Then magnification is v/u = 4.2 / (-0.21) ≈ -20. So magnification is increasing in magnitude as the object approaches the focal length from the outside.\n\nOnce the object crosses the focal length into u < -f (wait, no: in Cartesian convention, u is negative for real objects. The focal length is positive. So when is the object inside the focal length? When |u| < f. Since f is 0.2 m, so when the object is at u = -0.1 m, which is |u| = 0.1 m < 0.2 m, so inside the focal length.\n\nSo when the object is just inside the focal length, say u = -0.15 m, then:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u => 5 = 1/v - 1/(-0.15) => 5 = 1/v + 6.666... => 1/v = 5 - 6.666... ≈ -1.666... => v ≈ -0.6 m. Then magnification m = v/u = (-0.6)/(-0.15) = 4. So magnification is +4, meaning upright and four times larger. \n\nSo as the object moves from u = -0.3 m (outside f) to u = -0.1 m (inside f), the magnification goes from -2 to +2, but passing through larger magnitudes. Wait, but when it's just outside f, like at u = -0.21 m, magnification is -20, and when it's just inside f at u = -0.15 m, magnification is +4. So the magnification's magnitude increases as the object approaches the focal length from outside, reaches infinity at the focal length, then when moving inside, the magnification starts at positive infinity and decreases to +2 when at u = -0.1 m.\n\nTherefore, during the entire process of moving the lens from 0.3 m to 0.1 m above the coin (i.e., moving the object from u = -0.3 m to u = -0.1 m), the magnification starts at -2 (image inverted, 2x), increases in magnitude to infinity as the object approaches the focal length, then decreases from +infinity to +2. So the size of the image (the absolute value of magnification) first increases continuously from 2 to infinity, then decreases from infinity back to 2. But since the question is about moving from 0.3 m to 0.1 m, which crosses the focal length at 0.2 m, the image size first increases up to a point (when passing through the focal length) and then decreases? Wait, no, because when crossing the focal length, the image goes from real to virtual, and the magnification goes from negative infinity to positive infinity? Wait, but in reality, as the object crosses the focal length, the image goes from being a real image at infinity to a virtual image at negative infinity? \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that as the object moves from 0.3 m (outside f) to 0.1 m (inside f), the image size first increases until the object reaches the focal length, then after crossing the focal length, the image size decreases. But since the question is about the entire process, moving from 0.3 m to 0.1 m, the image size first increases (as the object approaches the focal length) and then decreases (as the object moves past the focal length and into the virtual image region). Therefore, the image size would first increase and then decrease. But looking at the options, option C says \"The image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size.\" Wait, no, according to this, it's the opposite: gets bigger first, then smaller. But none of the options directly say that. Wait, the options are:\n\nA: The image continually increases in size.\n\nB: The image continually decreases in size.\n\nC: The image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size.\n\nD: The image flips over.\n\nWait, according to the analysis, the image size increases as the object moves from 0.3 m towards the focal length (0.2 m), reaching maximum at infinity, then decreases as the object moves past the focal length towards 0.1 m. Therefore, the image size first increases then decreases. But none of the options A-D state that. Wait, option C is \"gets smaller at first and then bigger\", which is the opposite. Option A is \"continually increases\", which is not true because after crossing the focal length, it decreases. Option B is \"continually decreases\", which is also not true. Option D is \"flips over\", which would mean the image goes from inverted to upright, which is true. However, the question is about what happens to the image size. The question is specifically about the size, not the orientation. But let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the question is: \"During this process, what happens to the image of the coin?\" The options are about size and flipping. So the options are about size in A, B, C and flipping in D. So if the image flips over (from inverted to upright), that is option D. However, the question is about what happens to the image's size. Wait, but the options are separate. So maybe both flipping and size changes happen. But the options are separate. The question is asking what happens to the image of the coin during the process. The answer could involve both size and flipping, but the options are separate. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"A convex lens of focal length f = 0.2 m is used to examine a small coin lying on a table. During the examination, the lens is held a distance 0.3 m above the coin and is moved slowly to a distance of 0.1 m above the coin. During this process, what happens to the image of the coin? A:The image continually increases in size. B:The image continually decreases in size. C:The image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size. D:The image flips over.\"\n\nSo the question is asking what happens to the image. So if the image flips over (from inverted to upright) and the size first increases then decreases, but the options are only about size (A, B, C) or flipping (D). So if the question is about the size, then according to our analysis, the size first increases (from 2x to infinity) then decreases (from infinity back to 2x). Therefore, the size is increasing then decreasing. However, none of the options directly say \"increases then decreases.\" The options are A, B, C, D. Option C says \"gets smaller at first and then bigger,\" which is the opposite. So perhaps there is a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, maybe my analysis of the magnification is incorrect. Let me check again. When the object is at 0.3 m (u = -0.3 m), magnification is -2. When moving closer to the lens, let's take another point, say u = -0.25 m. Then v = 1 m (as calculated before), so m = v/u = 1 / (-0.25) = -4. So the magnification is -4, which is larger in magnitude. So the image is bigger. Then when approaching u = -0.2 m (focal length), the magnification approaches infinity. Then, when the object is just inside the focal length, say u = -0.15 m, we have v = -0.6 m, so m = (-0.6)/(-0.15) = +4. So magnification is +4. Then, when moving to u = -0.1 m, m = +2. So from u = -0.3 m to u = -0.2 m (outside f), magnification goes from -2 to -infinity (in magnitude increasing). Then, from u = -0.2 m to u = -0.1 m (inside f), magnification goes from +infinity to +2. Therefore, the absolute value of magnification (image size) increases from 2 to infinity, then decreases back to 2. Therefore, the image size first increases and then decreases. But none of the options say that. However, option C says \"gets smaller at first and then bigger in size,\" which is the opposite. Option A says \"continually increases,\" which is not true. Option B says \"continually decreases,\" also not true. Option D says \"flips over,\" which is true because the image goes from inverted to upright. But the question is asking what happens to the image. If the question is about the size, then there is no correct option. But maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the size as perceived by the observer. Wait, but the problem says \"during the examination,\" so maybe it's about the magnification in terms of angular magnification or something else? Wait, no, the problem is about the image formed by the lens. When using a convex lens as a magnifying glass, the object is placed inside the focal length to get a virtual image. However, in this case, the lens is moved from outside to inside the focal length. \n\nBut the question is about the image of the coin. If the image is real when the object is outside the focal length, and virtual when inside. The size of the image (the actual image, not the angular magnification) would depend on the magnification. \n\nBut according to our previous calculation, the image size first increases then decreases. Since none of the options A-C match this, but option D is about flipping, which does happen. However, the question is about what happens to the image of the coin during the process. If the image flips over, then D is correct. But the options are separate. However, the question might be considering that when using a magnifying glass (which is a convex lens), the image is virtual and upright when the object is inside the focal length. Initially, when the object is outside the focal length, the image is real and inverted. So during the movement from outside to inside, the image flips from inverted to upright. Therefore, option D is correct. But what about the size? The question might be focusing on the size when using it as a magnifying glass. Wait, but the problem states that the lens is used to examine the coin, which suggests it's being used as a magnifying glass, which requires the object to be inside the focal length to produce an upright, magnified virtual image. However, initially, the object is outside the focal length, so the image is real and inverted. But if you're examining the coin with the lens, you would want to have the object inside the focal length to get a magnified virtual image. Therefore, maybe during the process of moving the lens from 0.3 m to 0.1 m, the image goes from real (inverted) to virtual (upright), flipping over, and in terms of size, when it's real and inverted, the image is actually smaller or larger?\n\nWait, when the object is at 0.3 m (u = -0.3 m), the image distance v = +0.6 m, magnification m = -2. So the image is twice the size of the object, inverted. When you move the lens closer so that the object is at 0.1 m (u = -0.1 m), the image is virtual, upright, and magnification is +2, so also twice the size. So at the start and end, the image size is the same (twice the object size). However, when the object is between 0.3 m and 0.2 m, moving towards the focal length, the magnification increases beyond 2x. For example, at u = -0.25 m, magnification is -4x. So the image is four times larger. Then, when moving past the focal length into u = -0.15 m, magnification is +4x. So the image size is increasing from 2x to 4x to infinity and back to 2x. Therefore, during the entire process, the image size first increases to a maximum and then decreases. However, the options don't have an option that says \"increases then decreases.\" The options are A: continually increases, B: continually decreases, C: gets smaller then bigger, D: flips over.\n\nSince there's no option for \"increases then decreases,\" but option D is about flipping, which is true. However, the question might be a bit ambiguous. If the question is about the size of the image as seen by the eye, it's possible that when the image is real, it's not visible to the eye unless you place a screen, but since it's being used to examine the coin, likely the person is using it as a magnifying glass, meaning the object is within the focal length. However, the process involves moving the lens from outside to inside the focal length. So during the movement, when the object is outside the focal length, the image is real and inverted, but to see that image, you would need a screen. If the person is looking through the lens, they would only see the virtual image when the object is inside the focal length. Therefore, maybe the question is considering only the virtual image part? But the process includes moving through both regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the angular magnification. When using a magnifying glass, the angular magnification is given by M = f / |u|, but this is when the image is at infinity. However, this might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Let me think again. The focal length is 0.2 m. The object is moved from 0.3 m to 0.1 m. For a convex lens, when the object is beyond 2f (which would be 0.4 m here, but the object is at 0.3 m, which is between f and 2f), the image is real, inverted, and magnified. When the object is at f (0.2 m), the image is at infinity. When the object is between f and the lens (0.1 m), the image is virtual, upright, and magnified. \n\nThe magnification formula is m = v/u. But in terms of the size, for a convex lens, when the object is moved from beyond f to inside f, the magnification changes from negative (inverted) to positive (upright), and the absolute value of magnification increases as the object approaches f, then decreases after passing f. \n\nBut in our case, the object is moving from 0.3 m (which is between f and 2f) to 0.1 m (inside f). At 0.3 m, the magnification is -2. At 0.1 m, it's +2. In between, when approaching f, the magnification's absolute value increases. So the size of the image increases until the object reaches f, then decreases. Since the movement is from 0.3 m to 0.1 m, which includes crossing f at 0.2 m, the image size first increases (from 0.3 m to 0.2 m) and then decreases (from 0.2 m to 0.1 m). Therefore, the image size first increases then decreases. But none of the options say that. However, option C says \"gets smaller at first and then bigger in size,\" which is the opposite. Option A says \"continually increases,\" which is not true. Option B says \"continually decreases,\" also not true. Option D says \"flips over,\" which is true because the image goes from inverted to upright.\n\nBut the question is asking what happens to the image of the coin during the process. If the options include both size and flipping, but the question is specifically about the size, then there's no correct answer. However, if the question is about what happens to the image in general, then D is correct. But the options are separate. The question might be testing the understanding that when the object moves from outside to inside the focal length, the image flips from inverted to upright, hence option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me try another approach. Let's use the magnification formula for a convex lens: m = f / (f - u), where u is the object distance. Wait, no, the magnification is m = v/u, and from the lens formula, we can express v in terms of u and f. \n\nFrom the lens formula 1/f = 1/v + 1/u (assuming another sign convention where u is positive for real objects), then v = (f * u) / (u - f). Then magnification m = v/u = f / (u - f). \n\nLet's take u as positive distances. So when the object is at u = 0.3 m (outside f = 0.2 m), m = 0.2 / (0.3 - 0.2) = 0.2 / 0.1 = 2. But since for real images, the magnification is negative, so m = -2. When the object is at u = 0.1 m (inside f), then m = 0.2 / (0.1 - 0.2) = 0.2 / (-0.1) = -2, but since it's a virtual image, the magnification is positive, so m = +2. \n\nWait, this seems conflicting with earlier calculations. Let me clarify. If we use the formula m = f / (f - u), then for u > f, f - u is negative, so m is negative, indicating inverted image. For u < f, f - u is positive, so m is positive, upright image. The magnitude of magnification is |m| = |f / (f - u)|. \n\nSo for u = 0.3 m, |m| = 0.2 / (0.3 - 0.2) = 2. For u = 0.25 m, |m| = 0.2 / (0.25 - 0.2) = 0.2 / 0.05 = 4. For u = 0.2 m, |m| approaches infinity. For u = 0.15 m, |m| = 0.2 / (0.15 - 0.2) = 0.2 / (-0.05) = -4, but since it's virtual, we take positive, so 4. For u = 0.1 m, |m| = 0.2 / (0.1 - 0.2) = 0.2 / (-0.1) = -2, but again, taking absolute value, it's 2. \n\nSo the magnitude of magnification increases from 2 to infinity as the object approaches the focal length from outside, then decreases from infinity back to 2 as the object moves inside the focal length. Therefore, the image size first increases and then decreases. Since none of the options A-C state this, but option D says the image flips over, which is true. However, the question is asking about the image of the coin, and the options are about size or flipping. If the question is about the size, then there is no correct option, but if it's about orientation, then D is correct. But the options are separate, and the question is likely testing knowledge about magnification with convex lenses. \n\nGiven that in the process, the image flips from inverted to upright, which is a significant change, and the size first increases then decreases. But since the options don't have an option for size increasing then decreasing, and option D is about flipping, which is a true statement, maybe the intended answer is D. However, the question is about what happens to the image of the coin during the process. If the image flips over, then D is correct. But maybe the question is considering that when using a magnifying glass, the image is virtual and upright, and as you move the lens closer, the magnification changes. But in this case, the process involves moving through both real and virtual images. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed such that when the object is moved from beyond f to less than f, the image size continually increases. Wait, but according to our calculations, it first increases then decreases. But maybe there is a misunderstanding in the formula. Let me check with another approach. \n\nThe magnification for a convex lens as a magnifying glass is given by M = 1 + (d/f), where d is the near point distance (usually 25 cm), but this is when the image is at the near point. However, this might not apply here. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that when the object is moved closer to the lens (from 0.3 m to 0.1 m), the magnification increases. But according to the formula, when moving from u = 0.3 m (outside f) to u = 0.2 m (at f), the magnification increases to infinity, then when moving inside f, the magnification decreases from infinity to some value. So if the question is considering only the virtual image part (from just inside f to 0.1 m), then the magnification decreases from infinity to 2. But the process includes moving from outside to inside. \n\nSince the problem states that the lens is used to examine the coin, which implies using it as a magnifying glass (virtual image), but the process starts with the lens outside the focal length. Perhaps the question assumes that the image is always virtual, which is not the case. \n\nGiven the options provided, and considering that the image flips over (from inverted to upright), which is option D, and since the other options about size don't align with the calculations, perhaps the intended answer is D. However, the size does change, but since there's no option for that, maybe the question is testing the flipping. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again: when you move the object from outside the focal length to inside, the magnification's absolute value first increases to infinity and then decreases. So the image size first increases, then decreases. If the question is asking about the size, and the options don't have that, but option C says \"gets smaller at first and then bigger,\" which is the opposite, then perhaps there is a mistake in the question or the options. \n\nBut given the options, and knowing that the image flips over (D), and that the size increases then decreases, which is not an option, but since D is a true statement, and the question is from an exam, it's possible that the intended answer is D. However, another possibility is that the question is about the angular size, which might continually increase, but that's more complex. \n\nWait, when using a magnifying glass, as you bring the object closer to the lens (within the focal length), the magnification increases. But in this case, the object is moved from outside to inside. Initially, when the object is outside, the image is real and inverted, but as you bring the lens closer, you transition to a virtual image. If the person is looking at the image, they would see it flipping from inverted to upright. However, the size might first increase as the object approaches the focal length, then decrease as it moves past. But if the question is about the angular size perceived by the eye, it might be different. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the flipping is a definite change, and the size change is not captured in the options, I think the intended answer is D: The image flips over. But I need to verify once more. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about specific positions. At 0.3 m: real, inverted, magnified. At 0.2 m: image at infinity. At 0.1 m: virtual, upright, magnified. So during the movement, the image goes from inverted to upright, flipping over. Hence, option D is correct. The size changes, but since the question asks what happens to the image, and one of the options is flipping, which is a clear effect, D is likely the answer intended by the question. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
