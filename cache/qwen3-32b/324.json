Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes be tricky because they can have two different cases, right? Let me recall. The absolute value of something equals something else means that either the inside is positive or negative. So, I think I need to split this into two separate equations and solve each one, then check if the solutions are valid. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again: |5x - 1| = x + 3.\n\nSince there's an absolute value on the left side, I know that 5x - 1 could be equal to x + 3 or it could be equal to -(x + 3). Wait, no, actually, the absolute value equation |A| = B implies that A = B or A = -B, provided that B is non-negative. So, in this case, since the right side is x + 3, I need to make sure that x + 3 is non-negative because absolute values can't equal a negative number. So, that means x + 3 ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≥ -3. So, any solutions I find must satisfy x ≥ -3. I'll keep that in mind for later.\n\nNow, let me split the equation into two cases.\n\nCase 1: 5x - 1 = x + 3.\n\nCase 2: 5x - 1 = -(x + 3).\n\nLet me solve Case 1 first.\n\nCase 1: 5x - 1 = x + 3.\n\nSubtract x from both sides: 5x - x - 1 = 3 ⇒ 4x - 1 = 3.\n\nAdd 1 to both sides: 4x = 4.\n\nDivide by 4: x = 1.\n\nOkay, so x = 1 is a potential solution. Now let me check if it satisfies the original equation and also the condition x ≥ -3.\n\nFirst, check x = 1 in |5x - 1|:\n\nLeft side: |5(1) - 1| = |5 - 1| = |4| = 4.\n\nRight side: 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = 4. That works. And since 1 ≥ -3, it's valid. Good.\n\nNow, Case 2: 5x - 1 = -(x + 3). Let me solve this.\n\nFirst, distribute the negative sign on the right side: 5x - 1 = -x - 3.\n\nNow, add x to both sides: 5x + x - 1 = -3 ⇒ 6x - 1 = -3.\n\nAdd 1 to both sides: 6x = -3 + 1 ⇒ 6x = -2.\n\nDivide both sides by 6: x = -2/6 ⇒ x = -1/3.\n\nSo, x = -1/3 is another potential solution. Let me check this one as well.\n\nFirst, check if x = -1/3 satisfies x ≥ -3. Since -1/3 ≈ -0.333, which is greater than -3, so that's okay.\n\nNow, check the original equation.\n\nLeft side: |5*(-1/3) - 1| = |-5/3 - 1| = |-5/3 - 3/3| = |-8/3| = 8/3.\n\nRight side: (-1/3) + 3 = (-1/3) + 9/3 = 8/3. So, 8/3 = 8/3. That works too. Great.\n\nSo, both solutions x = 1 and x = -1/3 satisfy the equation. The question asks for the largest value of x. Between 1 and -1/3, obviously 1 is larger. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure there are no other cases or something I missed. The absolute value equation splits into two cases, and I solved both, checked both solutions, and they worked. So, there are only two solutions here. Therefore, the largest x is 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, sometimes when you solve equations, especially with variables on both sides, you might have extraneous solutions, but in this case, both checked out. Let me think if there's any other possible way this could be approached.\n\nAlternatively, maybe graphing both sides? The left side is an absolute value function, which is a V-shape, and the right side is a linear function. The intersection points would be the solutions. But since I already found the solutions algebraically, maybe that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the definition of absolute value. The expression |5x - 1| equals 5x - 1 when 5x - 1 ≥ 0, which is when x ≥ 1/5, and equals -(5x - 1) when x < 1/5. So, maybe splitting the problem based on the critical point at x = 1/5?\n\nWait, that might be another way to approach it. Let me try that method as a cross-check.\n\nSo, the critical point for the absolute value is when 5x - 1 = 0 ⇒ x = 1/5. Therefore, for x ≥ 1/5, |5x - 1| = 5x - 1, and for x < 1/5, |5x - 1| = -5x + 1.\n\nTherefore, we can split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: x ≥ 1/5. Then the equation becomes 5x - 1 = x + 3. Which is the same as before. Solving gives x = 1. Now, check if x = 1 is in the domain x ≥ 1/5. Since 1 ≥ 1/5, yes. So, valid.\n\nCase 2: x < 1/5. Then the equation becomes -5x + 1 = x + 3. Let me solve that:\n\n-5x + 1 = x + 3.\n\nSubtract x from both sides: -6x + 1 = 3.\n\nSubtract 1: -6x = 2 ⇒ x = 2 / (-6) ⇒ x = -1/3. Which is the same as before. Check if x = -1/3 is in the domain x < 1/5. Since -1/3 ≈ -0.333 < 0.2, yes. So, valid.\n\nSo, same solutions. Therefore, the same conclusion. Therefore, the largest x is 1. So, I think that's solid.\n\nBut let me also check if there are any restrictions on the right-hand side. The right-hand side is x + 3. Since absolute value is always non-negative, x + 3 must be ≥ 0. Therefore, x ≥ -3. Both solutions x = 1 and x = -1/3 are greater than -3, so they are okay. If we had found a solution less than -3, we would have to reject it. But here, both are okay.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The largest value is 1.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try plugging in some numbers around the solutions to see if there could be something else.\n\nFor example, suppose x = 2. Let's check |5*2 -1| = |10 -1| = 9. x + 3 = 5. 9 ≠ 5. So, no.\n\nx = 0. Let's check |0 -1| = |-1| = 1. x + 3 = 3. 1 ≠ 3. So, no.\n\nx = -3. Let's check |5*(-3) -1| = |-15 -1| = 16. x + 3 = 0. 16 ≠ 0. So, no solution here. Also, x = -3 is excluded because absolute value can't equal negative, but here it's zero, which is allowed. But 16 ≠ 0. So, no.\n\nHow about x = 1/5? Let's check. |5*(1/5) -1| = |1 -1| = 0. x + 3 = 1/5 + 3 = 16/5. 0 ≠ 16/5. So, no. But since x=1/5 is the boundary between the two cases, but in reality, it's not a solution.\n\nSo, seems like only x=1 and x=-1/3. Therefore, the largest is 1.\n\nWait, another thought. When solving absolute value equations, sometimes people make mistakes with the signs. Let me check my Case 2 again.\n\nCase 2: 5x -1 = -(x + 3). So, that is 5x -1 = -x -3. Then adding x to both sides: 6x -1 = -3. Then adding 1: 6x = -2. So x = -2/6 = -1/3. Yes, that's correct. So, no mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, if someone forgets to distribute the negative sign, they might do 5x -1 = -x + 3, which would be wrong. But I didn't do that, so that's good.\n\nAnother check: if I consider the original equation |5x - 1| = x + 3. Since absolute value is always non-negative, and x + 3 must also be non-negative. So, x ≥ -3. So, solutions must lie in that interval. Our solutions are x = 1 and x = -1/3, both in that interval. So, that's good.\n\nAnother way to think about absolute value equations is squaring both sides to eliminate the absolute value, but that can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions as well. Let me try that method just for verification.\n\nStarting with |5x - 1| = x + 3. Squaring both sides:\n\n(5x - 1)^2 = (x + 3)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: 25x² - 10x + 1.\n\nRight side: x² + 6x + 9.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n25x² -10x +1 -x² -6x -9 = 0 ⇒ 24x² -16x -8 = 0.\n\nSimplify by dividing all terms by 8: 3x² - 2x -1 = 0.\n\nNow, solving quadratic equation 3x² - 2x -1 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt( ( -2 )² - 4*3*(-1) )]/(2*3) = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)]/6 = [2 ± sqrt(16)]/6 = [2 ± 4]/6.\n\nTherefore, two solutions:\n\nx = (2 + 4)/6 = 6/6 = 1.\n\nx = (2 - 4)/6 = (-2)/6 = -1/3.\n\nSame solutions as before! So, squaring method also gives x=1 and x=-1/3. Then, since squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, we need to check them in original equation. But as we did before, both check out. Therefore, same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I think that's thorough. The largest solution is 1.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me visualize the functions. The left side is |5x -1|, which is a V-shaped graph. The right side is a straight line x + 3. The intersection points would be at x=-1/3 and x=1. Since the line x + 3 has a slope of 1, and the absolute value function has slopes of 5 and -5. Depending on where they intersect... Well, since we have two intersections, which we found. The rightmost intersection is at x=1, which is the larger solution.\n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say that the largest value of x satisfying the equation is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe largest value of $ x $ that satisfies the equation is \\boxed{1}.\n</think>"}
