The question is asking which of the options A to D is true. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts about electric charges and fields. Nonconducting materials, or insulators, don't allow charges to move freely. So if a nonconducting sphere is given a charge +Q, that charge is going to stay where it's placed, right? It can't move around the sphere because there's no free electrons or charges to redistribute. On the other hand, conducting materials have free electrons that can move in response to electric fields. So if a conducting sphere is neutral but brought near a charged object, the charges in the conductor will rearrange themselves.\n\nThe problem says the conducting sphere is neutral. So when the +Q nonconducting sphere is brought close, what happens? Well, in a conductor, the free electrons will be attracted to the side near the +Q sphere. Since the +Q is positive, it will induce a negative charge on the near side of the conducting sphere and a positive charge on the far side. This is called electrostatic induction. But since the conducting sphere is neutral overall, the total charge remains zero. There's just a separation of charges, not a net charge.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA: An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.\n\nHmm. Wait, in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material is zero. But here, the conducting sphere is not in equilibrium because it's being influenced by the nearby +Q charge. However, once the charges have rearranged, the electric field inside the conducting material should still be zero. Wait, but the question says \"within the conducting sphere\"—does that mean inside the material or within the volume? If it's referring to the electric field inside the conducting material, then it should be zero once the charges have moved to cancel the external field. But if it's referring to the electric field in the region around the sphere, then there would be an electric field. But I think in standard terminology, when they say \"within the conducting sphere,\" they mean inside the conductor itself. So maybe A is not correct? Wait, but the conducting sphere isn't in electrostatic equilibrium here because it's near another charge. Wait, no, when a conductor is in an external electric field, the free charges move until the internal electric field is canceled out. So even though it's near another charge, the induced charges will rearrange to cancel the external field inside the conductor. Therefore, the electric field inside the conducting sphere (the material) is zero. So A says \"an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere\"—but if the induced charges cancel it out, then there's no electric field inside. So A is false? Hmm. Maybe I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the process of induction, before the charges have moved, there's a temporary electric field, but once they move, it cancels. So in the steady state, the field inside the conductor is zero. So A is false. So A is not correct.\n\nB: The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.\n\nNo, because the conducting sphere is neutral. The charges are just separated. The total charge remains zero. So B is incorrect. Unless there's some contact or grounding involved, but the problem states it's neutral. So B is wrong.\n\nC: The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.\n\nD: The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.\n\nSo the nonconducting sphere is +Q. The conducting sphere is neutral, but when brought close, the side near the +Q sphere becomes negative, and the far side becomes positive. Since opposite charges attract, the +Q sphere will attract the induced negative charges on the near side of the conductor. The positive charges on the far side are farther away, so the net force is attraction. Therefore, the two spheres will attract each other. So C is correct.\n\nD is repulsion, which would happen if both spheres had the same charge. But since the conductor is neutral overall, but with induced charges, the attraction is the result. So C is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Let me think again about option A. The question is whether an electric field is induced within the conducting sphere. If the conducting sphere is in an external electric field, then yes, there would be an electric field inside the conductor until the induced charges cancel it out. Wait, but once the charges rearrange, the net electric field inside the conductor becomes zero. However, during the process, there might be a transient electric field. But the question is phrased as \"will be induced\"—so maybe when you bring the +Q sphere close, there is an induced electric field in the conductor, which causes the charges to move. Once they move, the field is canceled. So does that count as an induced electric field? The wording is a bit ambiguous. If the question is asking whether there is an electric field inside the conductor at any point, then during the induction process, there is. But once it's done, there isn't. However, the problem doesn't specify whether it's asking about during the induction or after it's finished. But generally, in such problems, we consider the steady state, after the charges have moved. So in the steady state, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore, A is not correct because the electric field isn't present anymore. So A is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the conducting sphere is polarized. The positive and negative charges are separated. The +Q sphere attracts the negative side and repels the positive side. But since the positive side is farther away, the attraction dominates. Therefore, the net force is attractive. Hence, C is correct.\n\nSo the answer is C.\n</think>"}
