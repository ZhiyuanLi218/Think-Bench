The problem mentions it's one-dimensional, with mass m, maximum amplitude A, and follows Hooke's law F = -kx. The answer choices are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators, both classical and relativistic.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position. The potential energy is converted entirely into kinetic energy at that point. For a classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option A. But the question specifies a relativistic oscillator, so the classical approach might not work here. Therefore, option A is probably not the correct answer because it doesn't take relativity into account.\n\nIn relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma*m*c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is then gamma*m*c² - m*c². So, if we consider the oscillator's total energy, at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential energy (assuming it starts from rest at amplitude A), and at equilibrium position, all that potential energy converts into kinetic energy.\n\nBut wait, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is conserved as the sum of kinetic and potential energy. However, in relativity, is potential energy treated the same way? Hmm. I think in relativistic mechanics, potential energy is still part of the total energy, but the kinetic energy is the relativistic one. So maybe we can still equate the maximum potential energy to the relativistic kinetic energy at equilibrium.\n\nSo let's try that. The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². At maximum displacement x = A, so potential energy is (1/2)kA². At equilibrium position, this converts into kinetic energy. Therefore, relativistic kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2)kA².\n\nSo, solving for v in terms of K:\n\n(gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2)kA².\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\ngamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)\n\nBut gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Therefore:\n\n1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)\n\nLet me denote (kA²)/(2 m c²) as some small quantity, maybe? Let's call it epsilon for simplicity. So:\n\n1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + epsilon\n\nBut I need to solve for v. Let me invert both sides:\n\nsqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + epsilon)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + epsilon)^2\n\nThen:\n\nv²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + epsilon)^2\n\nTherefore:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + epsilon)^2 )\n\nNow, substitute back epsilon = (kA²)/(2 m c²):\n\nv = c * sqrt[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²))² ]\n\nLooking at the answer options, let me check which one matches this.\n\nOption D is v_max = c*sqrt[1 - 1/(1 + kA²/(2 m c²))²], which is exactly what I have here. Therefore, the answer should be D.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with relativistic equations, there might be a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal energy at maximum displacement: Potential energy (1/2)kA² plus rest mass energy m c²?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in relativity, the total energy is conserved. At maximum displacement, the mass is at rest (assuming it's released from rest at amplitude A), so its total energy is rest energy plus potential energy? But in relativity, how is potential energy incorporated?\n\nThis is actually a more complex issue. In special relativity, potential energy is part of the total energy of the system. However, when considering the energy of the particle, it's not straightforward because potential energy is usually a property of the system, not just the particle. But in this case, perhaps we can still model it similarly to the classical case, assuming that the potential energy is stored in the field or whatever is causing the Hooke's law force. So if we take that approach, then at maximum displacement, the total energy of the particle is rest energy plus kinetic energy (which is zero, since it's at rest) plus potential energy (1/2)kA². Wait, but kinetic energy is separate from potential energy. Wait, total energy would be rest energy plus kinetic energy plus potential energy? Or is potential energy included in the total energy?\n\nActually, in classical mechanics, total mechanical energy is kinetic plus potential. In relativity, the kinetic energy is the difference between total energy and rest energy. But potential energy is still part of the total mechanical energy. However, in relativity, if we are considering the energy of the particle, it's unclear how to separate potential energy. However, if we assume that the potential energy is external to the particle's energy, then when the particle is at rest at maximum displacement, its total energy (from the particle's perspective?) No, in the lab frame, the total energy would be rest energy plus kinetic energy. But where does the potential energy fit in?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think again. In classical mechanics, energy conservation is K + U = constant. In relativity, if we want to have energy conservation, we need to include all forms of energy. However, when dealing with a particle in a potential, the total energy would be the relativistic kinetic energy (gamma m c² - m c²) plus potential energy U(x). Therefore, similar to classical, total mechanical energy is conserved as (gamma m c² - m c²) + U(x) = constant.\n\nIf that's the case, then at maximum displacement, the particle is at rest, so kinetic energy is zero, and total mechanical energy is U(A) = (1/2)kA². At equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic: (gamma m c² - m c²) = (1/2)kA². Which is what I had before. Therefore, my previous derivation is correct.\n\nTherefore, solving gives v_max = c*sqrt[1 - 1/(1 + kA²/(2 m c²))²], which is option D. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: c*sqrt[1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2m))²]. This seems problematic because if kA²/(2m) is positive, the denominator could become negative or lead to imaginary numbers. Also, units: kA² has units of energy (since (1/2)kA² is energy), so kA²/(2m) has units of (energy/mass) which is (m²/s²), so sqrt of that would be velocity. But in option B, there is no c in the denominator of that term, so unless kA²/(2m) is dimensionless, which it isn't. Therefore, option B is likely incorrect because of unit inconsistency. The argument of the square root must be dimensionless. In option B, 1 - (kA²/(2m)) has units of 1 - (m²/s²), which is not dimensionless. Therefore, B is invalid.\n\nOption C: c*sqrt[1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2 m c²))]. Let's check units. kA²/(2 m c²) is (energy)/(energy) since m c² has units of energy. Therefore, dimensionless. But the expression inside the square root is 1 + 1/(something). However, if kA²/(2 m c²) is positive, then 1 - kA²/(2 m c²) could be less than 1. But let's think about the derivation. In my case, I arrived at 1 - 1/(1 + epsilon)^2. Option D is that. Option C is 1 + 1/(1 - ...). Also, if we consider for small velocities, when kA²/(2 m c²) is very small, let's do a Taylor expansion.\n\nLet me check the non-relativistic limit. If the speed is non-relativistic, then (kA²)/(2 m c²) << 1. Let's expand option D:\n\nv = c*sqrt[1 - 1/(1 + epsilon)^2] where epsilon = kA²/(2 m c²) << 1.\n\nFirst compute 1/(1 + epsilon)^2 ≈ 1/(1 + 2 epsilon) ≈ 1 - 2 epsilon (using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x). Therefore:\n\n1 - [1 - 2 epsilon] ≈ 2 epsilon. Therefore v ≈ c*sqrt(2 epsilon) = c*sqrt(2*(kA²/(2 m c²))) = c*sqrt( (kA²)/ (m c²) ) = sqrt( kA²/m ) = classical result. Which is correct. So in the non-relativistic limit, option D reduces to the classical result. That's good.\n\nWhat about option C? Let's see:\n\nOption C is c*sqrt[1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2 m c²))]. Let me denote epsilon = kA²/(2 m c²) << 1.\n\nThen inside the sqrt: 1 + 1/(1 - epsilon) ≈ 1 + [1 + epsilon] = 2 + epsilon. Therefore sqrt(2 + epsilon)*c, which is way larger than c. That's impossible. So option C gives a speed larger than c in the non-relativistic limit? That can't be. Therefore, option C is invalid.\n\nOption B, as discussed earlier, has unit issues, so invalid. Option A is classical, not relativistic, so invalid for the question. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAnother check: if the potential energy becomes very large, such that (1/2)kA² is comparable to m c². Let's say (1/2)kA² = m c², so epsilon = (kA²)/(2 m c²) = 1. Then according to option D:\n\nv = c*sqrt[1 - 1/(1 + 1)^2] = c*sqrt[1 - 1/4] = c*sqrt(3/4) = c*(√3)/2 ≈ 0.866c. Which is less than c, as expected. If we tried to compute the classical result, it would give sqrt(kA²/m) which would correspond to gamma - 1 = (1/2)kA²/(m c²) = 1/(2 c²)*kA². If (1/2)kA² = m c², then gamma - 1 = (m c²)/(m c²) = 1, so gamma = 2. Then gamma = 2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) => sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/2 => 1 - v²/c² = 1/4 => v²/c² = 3/4 => v = (√3)/2 c. Which matches the result from option D. Therefore, even in this case, option D gives the correct relativistic result. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I'm confident the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
