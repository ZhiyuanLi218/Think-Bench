Chemical Reaction and Balancing**\n\nRubidium (Rb) is an alkali metal, and bromine (Br₂) is a diatomic halogen. They react to form **rubidium bromide (RbBr)**, an ionic compound. The balanced chemical equation is:\n\n$$\n2 \\text{Rb} + \\text{Br}_2 \\rightarrow 2 \\text{RbBr}\n$$\n\nThis tells us that **2 moles of Rb react with 1 mole of Br₂** to produce **2 moles of RbBr**.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

The options are RbBr only, RbBr and Rb, RbBr and Br2, or all three. Hmm, first, I should probably write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between rubidium and bromine.\n\nRubidium is a metal, and bromine is a non-metal, so they should form an ionic compound. The formula for rubidium bromide would be RbBr since rubidium has a +1 charge and bromide has a -1. The reaction would be Rb + Br2 → RbBr. Wait, but bromine is diatomic, so the balanced equation would need to balance the atoms properly.\n\nLet me balance it. Let's see: Rb + Br2 → RbBr. On the left, there's 1 Rb and 2 Br. On the right, 1 Rb and 1 Br. So to balance the bromine, I need 2 RbBr. That would make it 2 Rb + Br2 → 2 RbBr. So the balanced equation is 2 Rb + Br2 → 2 RbBr. Okay, got that.\n\nNow, I need to determine the limiting reagent here. The limiting reagent is the one that will be completely consumed first, and the other will be in excess. To find out which one is limiting, I need to calculate the moles of each reactant and compare them based on the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar masses. Rubidium (Rb) has an atomic mass of approximately 85.47 g/mol. Bromine (Br2) is diatomic, so its molar mass is 2 * 79.90 g/mol = 159.80 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of Rb = 1.0 g / 85.47 g/mol ≈ 0.0117 mol.\n\nMoles of Br2 = 1.0 g / 159.80 g/mol ≈ 0.00626 mol.\n\nNow, according to the balanced equation, the mole ratio of Rb to Br2 is 2:1. That means for every 2 moles of Rb, 1 mole of Br2 is needed. So, to find out which is limiting, I can compare the actual mole ratio to the stoichiometric ratio.\n\nThe stoichiometric ratio is 2 mol Rb per 1 mol Br2. Let's see what the actual ratio is. The actual moles are 0.0117 mol Rb and 0.00626 mol Br2. The ratio is 0.0117 / 0.00626 ≈ 1.87. The stoichiometric ratio is 2. So, the actual ratio is slightly less than 2. That means that Rb is the limiting reagent because we don't have enough Rb to react with all the Br2. Wait, no, if the actual ratio is less than the required ratio (1.87 < 2), that means we have less Rb relative to Br2 than needed, so Br2 is in excess? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think again. The balanced equation says 2 Rb react with 1 Br2. So, if I have 0.0117 mol Rb, how much Br2 is needed? The required Br2 would be (0.0117 mol Rb) * (1 mol Br2 / 2 mol Rb) = 0.00585 mol Br2. Since we have 0.00626 mol Br2 available, which is more than 0.00585, that means Br2 is in excess, and Rb is the limiting reagent. So, all the Rb will be consumed, and some Br2 will remain.\n\nWait, but let me check the other way. If I have 0.00626 mol Br2, how much Rb is needed? It would need 2 * 0.00626 = 0.0125 mol Rb. But we only have 0.0117 mol Rb, which is less than 0.0125. Therefore, Rb is limiting. So, Rb will be completely consumed, and Br2 will have some left over. So, after the reaction, the products would be RbBr and excess Br2. So the answer would be option C: RbBr and Br2 only.\n\nBut wait, let me verify the calculations again to be sure. Let me recalculate the moles.\n\nFor Rb: 1.0 g divided by 85.47 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 / 85.47 ≈ 0.0117 mol. Yes.\n\nFor Br2: 1.0 g divided by 159.80 g/mol. 1 / 159.8 ≈ 0.00626 mol. Correct.\n\nRequired Br2 for given Rb: 0.0117 / 2 = 0.00585 mol. Available Br2 is 0.00626, which is more. Therefore, Br2 is in excess. So Rb is limiting. So all Rb is consumed, Br2 has some left. Therefore, the products are RbBr and Br2. So answer is C.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"what will be left in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg)\". So we need to check if the remaining Br2 is more than 0.10 mg.\n\nSo let's calculate how much Br2 remains. The amount of Br2 that reacted is 0.00585 mol. The initial Br2 was 0.00626 mol. So remaining Br2 is 0.00626 - 0.00585 = 0.00041 mol. Then, convert that to grams: 0.00041 mol * 159.80 g/mol ≈ 0.0655 g. That's 65.5 mg, which is way more than 0.10 mg. So Br2 is left. Therefore, answer is C: RbBr and Br2 only.\n\nBut wait, could there be any Rb left? No, because Rb was the limiting reagent and all of it was consumed. So only Br2 remains. So the answer is C. Let me check the options again. Option C is RbBr and Br2 only. So that's the correct answer. The other options: A is only RbBr, but Br2 is left. B is RbBr and Rb, but Rb is all consumed. D is all three, but Rb is consumed. So C is correct.\n</think>"}
