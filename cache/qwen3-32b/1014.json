This means no work is required to move a charge along such a surface.\n- **Electric Field and Equipotential Surfaces**:\n  - The **electric field is always perpendicular** to an equipotential surface at every point.\n  - This is because the electric field is the **gradient (spatial derivative)** of the electric potential, and the gradient is always perpendicular to the level (equipotential) surfaces.\n- **Work Done by Electric Field**:\n  - The work done by the electric field when moving a charge between two points is related to the potential difference between those points.\n  - For a **negative test charge**, the electric field does **negative work** when the charge is moved from a **higher** potential to a **lower** potential, because the direction of motion is opposite to the direction of the electric force on the negative charge.\n\n---\n\n### **Option Analysis**\n\n- **(A) Two equipotential surfaces with different potentials may intersect**  \n  - **Incorrect**. If two equipotential surfaces with different potentials intersected, the potential at the point of intersection would have two values, which is impossible. Hence, they **never intersect**.\n\n- **(B) Electric field lines are perpendicular to equipotential surfaces everywhere**  \n  - **Correct**. This is a fundamental property of electrostatics. The electric field vector is always perpendicular to the equipotential surface at every point, since the field is the gradient of the potential.\n\n- **(C) The electric field intensity at all points on the same equipotential surface is necessarily equal**  \n  - **Incorrect**. While the *potential* is the same on an equipotential surface, the *electric field intensity* (magnitude and direction) can vary. For example, near an irregularly shaped conductor, the electric field can vary in strength across the surface, even though the surface is equipotential.\n\n- **(D) When moving a negative test charge from a higher potential equipotential surface to a lower potential equipotential surface, the electric field force does positive work**  \n  - **Incorrect**. The electric field does **negative work** in this case. The direction of motion is opposite to the direction of the force on a negative charge, resulting in **negative** work.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the **only correct statement** is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{B}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the options A to D is correct regarding the equipotential surfaces of an electrostatic field. Let me start by recalling what I know about equipotential surfaces.\n\nFirst, equipotential surfaces are surfaces where every point on the surface has the same electric potential. That means if you move a charge along an equipotential surface, the electric potential energy doesn't change. Now, electric field lines and equipotential surfaces are related. I remember that electric field lines are perpendicular to equipotential surfaces. That seems important. So maybe option B is correct? Let me check the other options first.\n\nOption A says two equipotential surfaces with different potentials may intersect. Hmm, if two surfaces have different potentials, can they intersect? If they intersect, then at the point of intersection, the potential would have two different values, which isn't possible. So equipotential surfaces can't intersect. So A is incorrect. That rules out A.\n\nOption C states that the electric field intensity is the same at all points on the same equipotential surface. Wait, electric field intensity is related to the electric field strength, which is the gradient of the potential. But just because the potential is the same on the surface doesn't mean the electric field is the same everywhere there. For example, consider a point charge. The equipotential surfaces are spheres, and the electric field intensity (magnitude) is the same at all points on a sphere, right? Because E = kQ/r², and r is constant on the sphere. But wait, in a more complex field, like near a dipole or a charged conductor, maybe the electric field intensity isn't the same on the same equipotential surface. Wait, but for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside is zero, and the equipotential surface is the surface of the conductor. But the electric field on the surface of a conductor can vary in magnitude depending on the curvature. So maybe C is not correct. For example, if you have an irregularly shaped conductor, the electric field at the surface is stronger where the curvature is higher. So even though the potential is the same on the surface, the electric field intensity isn't. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: When moving a negative test charge from a higher potential equipotential surface to a lower potential one, the electric field does positive work. Let's think. The work done by the electric field is W = qΔV. If the charge is negative, and moving from higher potential to lower potential, ΔV is negative (V_final - V_initial = lower - higher = negative). So W = q * ΔV = negative * negative = positive. So the electric field does positive work. So D is correct? Wait, but I need to be careful here. The work done by the electric field is positive if the charge moves in the direction the field would naturally push it. For a negative charge, the electric field direction is opposite to the direction of the force. So the electric field direction is from high potential to low potential in general. For a negative charge, the force is opposite to the electric field direction. So if you move a negative charge from higher to lower potential, which is the direction the electric field is pointing, but the force on the negative charge is opposite. So if you move it from higher to lower, the displacement is in the direction of the electric field, but the force on the negative charge is opposite. Therefore, the work done by the electric field would be force dot displacement, which would be negative. Wait, this is conflicting with my previous calculation. Let me clarify.\n\nThe work done by the electric field is W = -q * ΔV? Wait, no. The potential difference ΔV is V_final - V_initial. The work done by the electric field is W = q * E · d, but integrating along the path. Alternatively, W = q * (V_initial - V_final). Wait, the formula is W = -qΔV, where ΔV is V_final - V_initial. So if the charge moves from higher potential to lower, ΔV is negative. So W = -q*(negative) = positive if q is negative? Let's plug in numbers. Suppose V_initial is 10 V, V_final is 5 V. ΔV = -5 V. Then W = -q*(-5) = 5q. If q is negative, then W is negative. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me recall the correct formula. The work done by the electric field when moving a charge from point A to point B is W = q * (V_A - V_B). So if you move from higher potential (A) to lower potential (B), then V_A - V_B is positive. If the charge is negative, then W = negative * positive = negative. So the work done by the electric field is negative. Therefore, the electric field does negative work when moving a negative charge from higher to lower potential. So option D says the electric field does positive work, which is incorrect. Therefore, D is wrong. So that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Where is the mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of direction of force and displacement. For a negative charge, the electric force is in the direction opposite to the electric field. The electric field points from high potential to low potential. So the electric field direction is from higher to lower. The force on a negative charge is opposite, so from lower to higher. If you move the negative charge from higher to lower potential, displacement is in the direction opposite to the force. Therefore, work done by the electric field is force dot displacement, which is negative. So the electric field does negative work. Therefore, D is incorrect. So that suggests that D is wrong.\n\nSo if B is correct, and A, C, D are incorrect, then the answer is B.\n\nLet me check again. Option B says electric field lines are perpendicular to equipotential surfaces everywhere. Yes, because the electric field is the gradient of the potential, which means it points in the direction of maximum increase of the potential. Since the potential is constant on an equipotential surface, the direction of maximum increase must be perpendicular to the surface. Therefore, electric field lines are perpendicular. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n</think>"}
