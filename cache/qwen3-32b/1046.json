Hmm, let me think. I remember that this kind of problem involves statistical mechanics, maybe the Boltzmann distribution? Right, the Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of populations between two energy levels based on temperature and the energy difference between those levels.\n\nFirst, let me recall the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states is given by:\n\nn₂/n₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁)/(k*T)]\n\nWhere:\n- n₂/n₁ is the ratio we want to find.\n- g₂ and g₁ are the degeneracies (statistical weights) of the upper and lower energy levels.\n- E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two states.\n- k is the Boltzmann constant.\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out the degeneracies of the ground state and the second excited state of hydrogen, as well as the energy difference between them. Let me start with the energy levels of hydrogen.\n\nThe energy levels of hydrogen are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n²\n\nWhere n is the principal quantum number. The ground state is n=1, first excited state is n=2, second excited state is n=3. Wait, the question says \"second excited state,\" so that would be n=3, right? Because the first excited state is n=2, so the second is n=3. Let me confirm that. Yes, the nth energy level is (n-1)th excited state. So n=1 is ground, n=2 is first, n=3 is second. So we need the ratio between n=3 and n=1.\n\nSo E₁ = -13.6 eV / 1² = -13.6 eV\n\nE₃ = -13.6 eV / 3² = -13.6 / 9 ≈ -1.511 eV\n\nTherefore, the energy difference E₃ - E₁ is (-1.511) - (-13.6) = 12.089 eV.\n\nWait, but in the Boltzmann factor, it's exp[-(E₂ - E₁)/(k*T)], so in this case, since we are going from ground (n=1) to second excited (n=3), it's E₃ - E₁, which is positive. So the exponent is negative of that divided by k*T. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the formula is exp[-ΔE/(k*T)] where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. Since the atom is moving from a lower energy state (E₁) to a higher one (E₃), ΔE is positive. So the exponent is negative of that, so the whole exponent is negative, making the exponential term less than 1, which makes sense because higher energy states have fewer atoms at thermal equilibrium.\n\nSo, I need to calculate ΔE = E₃ - E₁ = 12.089 eV. Let me check the exact value. Let me compute -13.6 / 9:\n\n-13.6 divided by 9 is approximately -1.5111 eV. So the difference from E₁ is 13.6 - 1.5111 = 12.0889 eV. So approximately 12.09 eV. Let me note that.\n\nNow, the degeneracy of a hydrogen energy level is given by g_n = 2n². Because for each n, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can range from 0 to n-1, and for each l, there are (2l + 1) magnetic quantum numbers m, but when you sum over all l for a given n, the total degeneracy is 2n². Let me verify that. For n=1, l=0 only, so 2(1)^2 = 2, which is correct (spin up and down). For n=2, l=0 and 1. For l=0, degeneracy is 1 (m=0), for l=1, degeneracy is 3 (m=-1,0,1). So total is 1 + 3 = 4, multiplied by 2 for spin? Wait, no. Wait, the total number of states is 2*(sum over l (2l + 1)) for each n. Wait, actually, the formula is 2n². Let me check n=2: 2*(2)^2 = 8. Let's compute manually. For n=2, l=0 (s orbital): 2(0 + 1/2) ? Wait, no. The degeneracy comes from the number of possible states. For each n, the number of possible (l, m_l, m_s) combinations. For each l, m_l ranges from -l to +l, and for each m_l, there are two spin states (m_s = +1/2, -1/2). Therefore, for each l, the number of states is 2*(2l + 1). Therefore, total degeneracy for a given n is sum_{l=0}^{n-1} 2*(2l + 1). Let me compute this sum for n=2:\n\nl=0: 2*(1) = 2\n\nl=1: 2*(3) = 6\n\nTotal: 2 + 6 = 8. Which is 2*(2)^2 = 8. So yes, the formula g_n = 2n² is correct. Therefore, for n=1, g₁ = 2*(1)^2 = 2. For n=3, g₃ = 2*(3)^2 = 18. Therefore, the ratio of degeneracies is g₃/g₁ = 18/2 = 9.\n\nSo now, putting this into the Boltzmann equation:\n\nn₃/n₁ = (g₃/g₁) * exp[-(E₃ - E₁)/(k*T)]\n\nSo we have:\n\nn₃/n₁ = 9 * exp[-(12.09 eV)/(k*T)]\n\nBut now I need to compute this exponent. However, I need to make sure that the units are consistent. The energy is in eV, k is the Boltzmann constant, which is usually given in J/K, so I need to convert eV to Joules or use k in eV/K.\n\nLet me recall that the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K. Yes, that's right. So if I use k in eV/K, then the energy can stay in eV, and temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSo let me write that:\n\nk = 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K\n\nTemperature T is 10,000 K.\n\nSo let me compute the exponent:\n\nΔE/(k*T) = 12.09 eV / [ (8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K) * 10^4 K ]\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K * 10^4 K = 8.617 x 10^-1 eV = 0.8617 eV.\n\nSo the exponent is 12.09 / 0.8617 ≈ let me compute that.\n\nFirst, approximate 12.09 / 0.8617.\n\nWell, 0.8617 * 14 = approx 12.0638. Let me check:\n\n0.8617 * 14 = 0.8617 * 10 + 0.8617 * 4 = 8.617 + 3.4468 = 12.0638 eV. Which is very close to 12.09 eV. So 12.09 / 0.8617 ≈ 14.03.\n\nTherefore, the exponent is approximately -14.03. Therefore, the exponential term is exp(-14.03).\n\nNow, exp(-14) is approximately... Let me recall that ln(10) ≈ 2.3026, so e^(-14) ≈ 10^(-14 / 2.3026) ≈ 10^(-6.08). Let me compute that exponent:\n\n14 / 2.3026 ≈ 6.08. Therefore, e^(-14) ≈ 10^(-6.08). Which is approximately 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.08) ≈ 10^(-6) * 0.83 ≈ 8.3 x 10^(-7). But since our exponent was -14.03, which is slightly more negative than -14, so exp(-14.03) ≈ e^(-14) * e^(-0.03) ≈ 8.3 x 10^(-7) * 0.97 ≈ 8.05 x 10^(-7).\n\nTherefore, the exponential term is approximately 8.05 x 10^(-7). Then multiply by the degeneracy ratio of 9:\n\nn₃/n₁ ≈ 9 * 8.05 x 10^(-7) ≈ 7.245 x 10^(-6).\n\nLooking at the options given, option B is 7.26 x 10^-6. That seems very close. So perhaps the answer is B.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again for accuracy. Maybe my approximations introduced some error. Let me recalculate the exponent more precisely.\n\nFirst, let's compute ΔE = E₃ - E₁. Let me calculate E₃ more accurately.\n\nE₁ = -13.6 eV\n\nE₃ = -13.6 / 9 eV. Let me compute that exactly. 13.6 divided by 9:\n\n9 * 1.5 = 13.5, so 13.6 / 9 = 1.5111... eV. Therefore, E₃ = -1.5111 eV. Therefore, E₃ - E₁ = (-1.5111) - (-13.6) = 12.0889 eV. Let's take ΔE = 12.0889 eV.\n\nNow, k*T = 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K * 10^4 K = 8.617 x 10^-1 eV = 0.8617 eV.\n\nSo ΔE/(k*T) = 12.0889 / 0.8617 ≈ let me compute this division more accurately.\n\nLet me do 12.0889 / 0.8617.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 0.8617:\n\nLet me write this as 12.0889 / 0.8617.\n\nLet me compute 0.8617 * 14 = 12.0638 as before. The difference between 12.0889 and 12.0638 is 0.0251 eV.\n\nSo 14 + (0.0251 / 0.8617). Let me compute 0.0251 / 0.8617 ≈ 0.0291. Therefore, the total is approximately 14.0291. Therefore, ΔE/(k*T) ≈ 14.0291. Therefore, the exponent is -14.0291.\n\nSo exp(-14.0291). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nFirst, let's recall that ln(10) ≈ 2.302585093.\n\nSo, if I want to express exp(-14.0291) as 10^x, then x = -14.0291 / ln(10) ≈ -14.0291 / 2.302585 ≈ -6.093.\n\nTherefore, 10^(-6.093) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.093). Let me compute 10^(-0.093). Taking natural logs isn't helpful here, but I know that 10^(-0.093) ≈ e^(-0.093 * ln(10)) ≈ e^(-0.093 * 2.3026) ≈ e^(-0.2141) ≈ 0.806.\n\nAlternatively, using logarithm tables or known values. For example, 10^(-0.093) ≈ since 10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.794, and 10^(-0.09) ≈ 10^(0.01) * 10^(-0.1) ≈ 1.023 * 0.794 ≈ 0.812. Since 0.093 is between 0.09 and 0.1, let's approximate. Let me use linear approximation.\n\nLet me take two points:\n\nAt x = -0.09: 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1/(10^0.09). Let me compute 10^0.09. Since 10^0.09 = e^(0.09 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.09 * 2.3026) ≈ e^(0.2072) ≈ 1.229. Therefore, 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1/1.229 ≈ 0.813.\n\nAt x = -0.10: 10^(-0.10) ≈ 1/(10^0.10) ≈ 1/1.2589 ≈ 0.794.\n\nSo between x = -0.09 and x = -0.10, the value goes from ~0.813 to ~0.794 over an interval of 0.01 in x. Our x is -0.093, which is 0.003 into this interval. So the difference between -0.09 and -0.093 is 0.003. So the decrease is (0.813 - 0.794) * (0.003 / 0.01) = 0.019 * 0.3 = 0.0057. Therefore, approximate value is 0.813 - 0.0057 ≈ 0.807. Therefore, 10^(-0.093) ≈ 0.807. Therefore, 10^(-6.093) ≈ 10^(-6) * 0.807 ≈ 8.07 x 10^(-7).\n\nTherefore, exp(-14.0291) ≈ 8.07 x 10^(-7). Then multiply by the degeneracy ratio of 9:\n\nn₃/n₁ ≈ 9 * 8.07 x 10^(-7) ≈ 7.263 x 10^(-6). Which is approximately 7.26 x 10^(-6), which is option B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B:7.26 * 10^-6.\n\nBut let me check once more for possible errors. For example, did I use the correct degeneracy?\n\nFor n=1, g₁ = 2*1² = 2. For n=3, g₃ = 2*3² = 18. So ratio g₃/g₁ = 9. That seems correct.\n\nEnergy levels: Yes, the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n² is correct for hydrogen. The difference between n=3 and n=1 is indeed about 12.09 eV. Correct.\n\nTemperature is 10^4 K, so 10,000 K. Correct.\n\nBoltzmann constant k is 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K. Correct.\n\nCalculations of ΔE/(k*T): 12.09 / 0.8617 ≈ 14.03. Correct.\n\nExponential of -14.03 is approx 8.07e-7. Multiply by 9 gives approx 7.26e-6. So option B. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with exact calculation using calculator-like steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute exp(-14.0291) numerically. Let me recall that e^-14 is approximately?\n\nWell, e^-10 ≈ 4.5399e-5\n\ne^-14 = e^-10 * e^-4 ≈ 4.5399e-5 * 0.0183156 ≈ 4.5399e-5 * 1.83156e-2 ≈ 8.317e-7. Then, since our exponent is -14.0291, which is -14 - 0.0291, so e^(-14.0291) = e^-14 * e^-0.0291 ≈ 8.317e-7 * e^-0.0291.\n\nCompute e^-0.0291 ≈ 1 - 0.0291 + (0.0291)^2/2 - ... ≈ approximately 0.9714. Let me check with Taylor series:\n\ne^-x ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x³/6.\n\nx = 0.0291.\n\nSo:\n\n1 - 0.0291 + (0.0291)^2 / 2 - (0.0291)^3 / 6 ≈\n\nFirst term: 1 - 0.0291 = 0.9709\n\nSecond term: (0.0008468)/2 ≈ 0.0004234 → total ≈ 0.9709 + 0.0004234 ≈ 0.97132\n\nThird term: -(0.0291)^3 / 6 ≈ -(0.0000246)/6 ≈ -0.0000041 → total ≈ 0.97132 - 0.0000041 ≈ 0.971316.\n\nSo e^-0.0291 ≈ 0.9713. Therefore, multiplying 8.317e-7 * 0.9713 ≈ 8.317 * 0.9713 * 1e-7 ≈ Let's compute 8.317 * 0.9713.\n\nFirst approximate 8.317 * 0.97 = 8.317*(1 - 0.03) = 8.317 - 0.2495 ≈ 8.0675.\n\nBut since it's 0.9713, which is 0.97 + 0.0013. So adding 8.317 * 0.0013 ≈ 0.0108. Therefore total ≈ 8.0675 + 0.0108 ≈ 8.0783. Therefore, approx 8.0783e-7. Then multiply by 9 gives 7.2705e-6. Which is 7.27 x 10^-6. Which rounds to 7.26 x 10^-6, considering possible rounding during calculations. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
