Let me start by recalling what a perfect nth power is. A number is a perfect nth power if it can be written as some integer raised to the nth power. So, in other words, there exists some integer k such that 2²⁴ = kⁿ. \n\nFirst, let me think about the prime factorization of 2²⁴. Since 2 is already a prime number, its 24th power is just 2²⁴. So, the prime factorization is straightforward. Now, if I have another integer k such that kⁿ equals 2²⁴, then k must also be a power of 2. Because if k had any other prime factors, then kⁿ would have those primes in its factorization as well, but 2²⁴ only has 2 as its prime factor. Therefore, k must be of the form 2^m for some integer m. \n\nSo, substituting k = 2^m into the equation, we get:\n\n(2^m)ⁿ = 2²⁴\n\nSimplifying the left side, that becomes 2^(m*n). Therefore, we have:\n\n2^(m*n) = 2²⁴\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal:\n\nm * n = 24\n\nSo, m and n are positive integers such that their product is 24. But remember, the problem specifies that n > 1. Also, since m must be a positive integer (because k is a positive integer, as we are talking about perfect powers), we need to find all pairs (m, n) where m and n are positive integers, n > 1, and m * n = 24. However, the question is asking for the number of such n. Therefore, we need to find all divisors of 24 that are greater than 1, but there's a catch here. Wait, not exactly. Because for each divisor n of 24 (greater than 1), there exists an m such that m = 24 / n, so that m * n = 24. Therefore, the number of such n is equal to the number of divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. But hold on, let me check if there's more to it.\n\nWait, but actually, since m must also be a positive integer, n must divide 24. Therefore, the number of possible n > 1 is equal to the number of positive divisors of 24 minus 1 (excluding n=1). However, before jumping to that conclusion, let me verify with an example. For example, take n=2. Then m=12, so k=2^12, and indeed (2^12)^2 = 2^24. Similarly, n=3, m=8, so (2^8)^3 = 2^24. So, each divisor n>1 of 24 gives a valid k=2^(24/n). Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of positive divisors of 24 greater than 1.\n\nBut let me recall that the number of divisors of a number is found by taking its prime factorization, adding 1 to each exponent, and multiplying. The prime factorization of 24 is 2³ * 3¹. Therefore, the number of positive divisors is (3 + 1)*(1 + 1) = 4*2=8. Therefore, there are 8 positive divisors. Subtracting 1 (for n=1), we get 7. Therefore, the answer is 7?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me list all the divisors of 24 to check. The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So that's 8 divisors. Excluding 1, we have 7 divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Therefore, the answer would be 7. However, let me think again—is there any restriction on m? For example, m has to be a positive integer, but since n divides 24, m=24/n is automatically a positive integer. Therefore, yes, for each n>1 that divides 24, we have a valid m. Therefore, the answer is 7. \n\nBut let me think again—is there a possibility that different n could lead to the same k? For example, if n1 and n2 are different divisors, could they result in the same k? However, the question is not asking for the number of different k's, but the number of n's for which 2²⁴ is a perfect nth power. So even if different n's lead to same k, they are still different n's. For example, take n=2 and n=4. For n=2, k=2¹², and for n=4, k=2⁶. These are different k's, but both satisfy that 2²⁴ is a perfect nth power. Therefore, each n counts separately. Therefore, the answer is indeed 7. \n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose someone thinks that maybe n has to divide the exponent 24 in some other way. For example, suppose we have a number which is a perfect square and a perfect cube, etc. But here, since 2²⁴ is already expressed as a power, and we want it to be equal to kⁿ. Since k is 2^m, then exponent is m*n. Therefore, m*n must be 24. Therefore, n must divide 24. Therefore, the logic seems sound. \n\nAlternatively, think of the exponents. For 2²⁴ to be a perfect nth power, the exponent 24 must be a multiple of n. Therefore, n must be a divisor of 24. Therefore, n | 24 and n>1. Therefore, the number of divisors of 24 greater than 1 is 7. Therefore, answer is 7. \n\nWait, but let me check if n can be something that isn't a divisor of 24? Suppose n doesn't divide 24, then 24/n isn't integer, so m would not be integer, so k would not be integer. Therefore, n must divide 24. Therefore, indeed, only divisors of 24. Therefore, answer is 7. \n\nBut let me check with specific examples. Let's take n=2: 2²⁴ is a perfect square, yes, since it's (2¹²)². Similarly, n=3: (2⁸)³. n=4: (2⁶)^4. n=6: (2⁴)^6. n=8: (2³)^8. n=12: (2²)^12. n=24: (2¹)^24. All of these work. So 7 different n's. Therefore, answer is 7. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check if n can be larger than 24? For example, suppose n=48. Then m would be 24 / 48 = 0.5, which is not an integer, so k would be 2^0.5 which is not integer. Therefore, n cannot be larger than 24? Well, actually, n can be as large as 24, since 24 is a divisor of itself. For n=24, m=1. So, k=2^1=2, and 2^24 is indeed 2^24. So n=24 is allowed. But n larger than 24 would require m to be less than 1, which would not be allowed because m has to be positive integer. Therefore, n cannot exceed 24. Therefore, all possible n's are divisors of 24 greater than 1, which are 7. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 7. However, let me check once again if there is a mistake in my reasoning. For example, maybe there are some n's which are not divisors of 24, but still 24 is a multiple of n? Wait, no. If n divides 24, then 24 is a multiple of n. If n does not divide 24, then 24 is not a multiple of n. Wait, no. Wait, if n divides 24, then 24 is a multiple of n. However, if n does not divide 24, then 24 is not a multiple of n. Wait, actually, no. For example, 6 divides 24. But 15 does not divide 24, and 24 is not a multiple of 15. However, suppose n is such that n divides 24? Wait, the logic is that m*n=24. Therefore, n must divide 24. Therefore, n must be a divisor of 24. Therefore, the only possible n's are the divisors of 24. Therefore, the answer is 7. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that maybe exponents can be adjusted with different prime factors, but since our original number is 2²⁴, which only has 2 as prime factor, then any nth root must also be a power of 2, so same logic applies. Therefore, I think my reasoning is correct. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers n>1 is equal to the number of divisors of 24 greater than 1, which is 7. Therefore, the answer is 7. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me list all divisors again. Divisors of 24 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \n\nExcluding 1, we have 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. That's 7 numbers. Therefore, yes, 7. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 7. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{7}\n</think>"}
