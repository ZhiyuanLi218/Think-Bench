Hmm, so the problem gives me the diameter of Tatooine as 10,465 km, and we have 100 million 1-GeV neutrinos passing through it. The cross-section σ is given as 0.7×10^-38 cm² per nucleon, and the density ρ is approximately 8 g/cm³. The options for the answer are A:98, B:35, C:73, D:14. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how to calculate the number of interactions for neutrinos passing through a material. I remember that the number of interactions is generally given by the formula N = N₀ * σ * N_A * ρ * X / A, where N₀ is the initial number of neutrinos, σ is the cross-section, N_A is Avogadro's number, ρ is the density, X is the thickness of the material, and A is the atomic mass. Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully about this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is N = N₀ * σ * n * X, where n is the number density of target nucleons, and X is the thickness. Let me check. The interaction probability is σ * n * X, so the expected number of interactions would be N₀ * σ * n * X. Yes, that seems right. So I need to find the number density n of nucleons in Tatooine, multiply by the cross-section σ, multiply by the thickness X (which would be the diameter of the planet, since the neutrinos pass through it), and then multiply by the initial number of neutrinos N₀.\n\nBut first, let me make sure about the units. The cross-section σ is given in cm² per nucleon, so I need to make sure that the units for density and thickness are compatible. Let's start by converting the diameter of Tatooine into centimeters because the cross-section is in cm² and the density is in g/cm³.\n\nThe diameter is 10,465 km. Let's convert that to meters first, then to centimeters. 1 km is 1000 meters, so 10,465 km is 10,465,000 meters. Then, since 1 meter is 100 cm, that's 10,465,000 * 100 cm = 1.0465×10^9 cm. Let me verify that calculation:\n\n10,465 km = 10,465 × 10^3 m = 1.0465 × 10^7 m. Wait, no, 10,465 × 10^3 m is 10,465,000 m, which is 1.0465 × 10^7 m. Then converting to cm: 1 m = 100 cm, so multiply by 100: 1.0465 × 10^7 m × 100 cm/m = 1.0465 × 10^9 cm. Yes, that's correct. So X, the thickness, is 1.0465 × 10^9 cm.\n\nNext, the density ρ is given as 8 g/cm³. But we need the number density of nucleons, n. To find that, we need to know how many nucleons are in a gram of material. Assuming that the material is made up of nucleons (protons and neutrons), each with a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu). Since 1 amu is about 1.66 × 10^-24 g. Therefore, the number of nucleons per gram is 1 / (1.66 × 10^-24) ≈ 6.02 × 10^23 per gram. Wait, that's Avogadro's number! Because Avogadro's number is about 6.022 × 10^23 per mole, and since 1 mole of nucleons would have a mass of 1 gram per mole (since 1 mole of carbon-12 is 12 grams, but here we're approximating each nucleon as 1 gram per mole). So actually, the number density n is ρ multiplied by the number of nucleons per gram. \n\nSo n = ρ * (number of nucleons per gram). Since each gram of material has Avogadro's number of nucleons if the atomic mass is 1 g/mol. But in reality, the atomic mass A would be different. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the composition of Tatooine. However, since they give us the density and the cross-section per nucleon, maybe we can assume that each gram corresponds to a certain number of nucleons based on the average atomic mass. However, without knowing the specific elements, perhaps we need to make an assumption here. For example, if we assume that the material is composed of elements with an average atomic mass of, say, 2 g/mol (like helium), then each gram would contain 1/(2 g/mol) * Avogadro's number. But the problem doesn't specify. Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by assuming that the density is given in grams per cm³, and each gram is one mole? No, that can't be. Wait, the problem says the cross-section is per nucleon, so maybe we need to compute the number of nucleons per cm³. \n\nLet me think again. Let's take the density ρ = 8 g/cm³. Let's assume that the material has an average atomic mass of A grams per mole. Then, the number of moles per cm³ is ρ / A. Then, the number of atoms per cm³ is (ρ / A) * N_A. But each atom has Z protons and N neutrons, so total nucleons per atom is A (assuming A is the mass number). Wait, but if the atomic mass is A grams per mole, then each atom has approximately A nucleons (protons + neutrons). Therefore, the number of nucleons per cm³ would be (ρ / A) * N_A * A = ρ * N_A. Wait, that cancels out A. So n = ρ * N_A? That can't be right. Wait, let me do the math step by step.\n\nNumber of moles per volume: n_moles = ρ / M, where M is the molar mass (g/mol). Then, number of atoms per volume is n_moles * N_A = (ρ / M) * N_A. Each atom has A nucleons (if the molar mass is approximately equal to the mass number A, assuming one atom per molecule, which is a rough approximation). Therefore, number of nucleons per volume is (ρ / M) * N_A * A. But if M is approximately A grams per mole (since molar mass ≈ mass number in g/mol), then M ≈ A. Therefore, n ≈ (ρ / A) * N_A * A = ρ * N_A. Therefore, the number density of nucleons n is ρ multiplied by Avogadro's number. Wait, but that would be 8 g/cm³ * 6.022×10^23 mol⁻¹. But that seems extremely high. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check units. \n\nWait, the molar mass M is in g/mol. If I have density ρ in g/cm³, then the number of moles per cm³ is ρ / M. Then, number of atoms per cm³ is (ρ / M) * N_A. If each atom has A nucleons, then number of nucleons per cm³ is (ρ / M) * N_A * A. But if M ≈ A (in g/mol), then this becomes (ρ / A) * N_A * A = ρ * N_A. So yes, n = ρ * N_A. But that would mean n = 8 g/cm³ * 6.022×10^23 nucleons/mol / (g/cm³... Wait, no, the units here are confusing. Let me write it properly.\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say we have a material with density ρ = 8 g/cm³. Let's assume that the molar mass is M = 16 g/mol (like oxygen, for example). Then, the number of moles per cm³ is 8 / 16 = 0.5 mol/cm³. Then, the number of atoms per cm³ is 0.5 * N_A. Each atom of oxygen has 16 nucleons (assuming it's O-16). So the number of nucleons per cm³ is 0.5 * N_A * 16 = 8 * N_A. Which is ρ * N_A. Because 8 g/cm³ * N_A? Wait, in this case, M was 16 g/mol, but we ended up with n = (ρ / M) * N_A * A. Since A = 16 (mass number), and M ≈ A (for elements, molar mass ≈ mass number in g/mol). Therefore, substituting M ≈ A, we get n ≈ (ρ / A) * N_A * A = ρ * N_A. Therefore, regardless of the element, if we assume that the molar mass is approximately equal to the mass number (which is a good approximation for most elements), then the number density of nucleons is n ≈ ρ * N_A. \n\nBut wait, in this case, ρ is in g/cm³, N_A is in mol⁻¹. Let me check the units. Let's say ρ is in g/cm³, N_A is in mol⁻¹ (Avogadro's number is 6.022×10^23 mol⁻¹). So multiplying them gives (g/cm³) * (mol⁻¹). But how does that give us nucleons per cm³? Wait, perhaps there's a missing factor here. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem is that molar mass M has units of g/mol. So if I have number density n_nucleons = (ρ / M) * N_A * A. But since M ≈ A (g/mol), then n_nucleons ≈ (ρ / A) * N_A * A = ρ * N_A / (g/mol) * mol? Wait, no. Let me write the units properly. \n\nLet me define:\n\nρ [g/cm³] / M [g/mol] = [mol/cm³]\n\nMultiply by N_A [nucleons/mol] * A [nucleons/atom]? Wait, no. Wait, if each atom has A nucleons, then multiplying by A would be nucleons/atom * atoms/mol * mol/cm³? Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try again.\n\nLet me take the number of nucleons per volume:\n\nn_nucleons = (number of atoms per volume) * (number of nucleons per atom)\n\nNumber of atoms per volume is (ρ / M) * N_A, as before. Number of nucleons per atom is approximately A (mass number). Therefore:\n\nn_nucleons ≈ (ρ / M) * N_A * A\n\nBut if M ≈ A * (1 g/mol per nucleon), which is roughly true because 1 mole of nucleons has a mass of about 1 g. For example, carbon-12 has a molar mass of 12 g/mol and 12 nucleons per atom. Therefore, M ≈ A [g/mol]. Therefore, substituting M ≈ A:\n\nn_nucleons ≈ (ρ / A) * N_A * A = ρ * N_A [nucleons/cm³]\n\nSo the units would be:\n\nρ [g/cm³] * N_A [nucleons/mol] ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if M is in g/mol, and we have ρ / M [mol/cm³], multiplied by N_A [nucleons/mol] * A [nucleons/atom]? No, sorry. Let me think of it in terms of units:\n\nIf n_nucleons = (ρ / M) * N_A * A, then:\n\nρ has units g/cm³\n\nM has units g/mol\n\nTherefore, ρ / M has units mol/cm³\n\nMultiply by N_A (mol⁻¹) gives (mol/cm³) * (mol⁻¹) = 1/cm³? Wait, no:\n\nWait N_A is in nucleons/mol? No, N_A is in mol⁻¹. Wait, Avogadro's number is 6.022×10^23 mol⁻¹. So if you have (mol/cm³) * N_A (mol⁻¹), you get 1/cm³? No, that would be (mol/cm³) * (mol⁻¹) = 1/cm³. But then multiplied by A [nucleons/atom]? Wait, no. Wait, the number of atoms per volume is (ρ / M) * N_A, which would have units of (mol/cm³) * (mol⁻¹) * something? Wait, no:\n\nWait, number of moles per volume is (ρ / M) [mol/cm³]. Multiply by Avogadro's number [atoms/mol] to get atoms per volume [atoms/cm³]. Then, multiply by number of nucleons per atom (A [nucleons/atom]) to get nucleons per volume [nucleons/cm³]. Therefore:\n\nn_nucleons = (ρ / M) [mol/cm³] * N_A [atoms/mol] * A [nucleons/atom] = (ρ * N_A * A) / M [nucleons/cm³]\n\nBut since M ≈ A [g/mol], then:\n\nn_nucleons ≈ (ρ * N_A * A) / A = ρ * N_A [nucleons/cm³]\n\nTherefore, the units are [g/cm³] * [mol⁻¹] ??? Wait, no. Wait, if M is in g/mol, then the units of ρ / M are (g/cm³) / (g/mol) = mol/cm³. Then multiply by N_A (atoms/mol) gives atoms/cm³. Multiply by A (nucleons/atom) gives nucleons/cm³. Therefore, the final units are nucleons/cm³. But since M ≈ A, then we can approximate n_nucleons ≈ ρ * N_A [nucleons/cm³]. However, the problem is that N_A has units of mol⁻¹, but how does multiplying by ρ (g/cm³) give nucleons/cm³? It seems like there's a missing unit conversion here. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in this reasoning. Let me take concrete numbers. Let's say we have ρ = 8 g/cm³. Let's assume that the material is iron, which has a molar mass of about 56 g/mol. Then, number of moles per cm³ is 8 / 56 ≈ 0.1429 mol/cm³. Number of atoms per cm³ is 0.1429 * 6.022×10^23 ≈ 8.6×10^22 atoms/cm³. Each iron atom has 56 nucleons (for Fe-56), so number of nucleons per cm³ is 8.6×10^22 * 56 ≈ 4.8×10^24 nucleons/cm³. \n\nNow, if we use the formula n ≈ ρ * N_A, that would be 8 g/cm³ * 6.022×10^23 mol⁻¹. But that would be 4.8×10^24 (g·mol⁻¹)/cm³, which doesn't make sense. Wait, so clearly there's a missing factor here. The problem is that N_A has units of mol⁻¹, but we need to convert grams to moles. Therefore, the correct formula should involve dividing by the molar mass. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the molar mass of Tatooine's material, maybe we are supposed to assume that the density is given in grams per cm³ and that each gram corresponds to 1 mole? That would mean that the molar mass is 1 g/mol, which is not realistic for any element (the lightest elements have molar masses around 1 g/mol, like hydrogen). However, hydrogen has a molar mass of about 1 g/mol, but its density is nowhere near 8 g/cm³. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the density is given as 8 grams per cm³, and that each gram is one nucleon? That would mean that the number of nucleons per cm³ is 8 grams/cm³ * (1 nucleon / 1 gram) = 8 nucleons/cm³. But that's obviously wrong because 1 gram of nucleons would be a huge number of nucleons. For example, 1 gram divided by (1.66×10^-24 g/nucleon) ≈ 6×10^23 nucleons. So 8 g/cm³ would be 8 * 6×10^23 ≈ 4.8×10^24 nucleons/cm³. Which is similar to the iron example above. \n\nSo perhaps the problem is making an approximation where they consider that the number density of nucleons n is equal to the density ρ multiplied by Avogadro's number divided by the molar mass. But since the molar mass isn't given, maybe they expect us to assume that the material is made of nucleons with a mass of 1 gram per mole? Which is not correct, but perhaps for the sake of the problem, we can proceed? \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Since the problem gives the density as 8 g/cm³, and cross-section per nucleon, perhaps we can find the number of nucleons per cm³ by assuming that the mass of each nucleon is approximately 1 atomic mass unit, which is about 1.66×10^-24 grams. Therefore, the number of nucleons per cm³ is density divided by mass per nucleon. \n\nYes! That makes sense. Let's try this approach. \n\nNumber density of nucleons n = ρ / m_nucleon\n\nWhere ρ is the mass density (8 g/cm³), and m_nucleon is the mass per nucleon (≈ 1.66×10^-24 g). \n\nTherefore, n = 8 g/cm³ / (1.66×10^-24 g/nucleon) ≈ 8 / 1.66×10^-24 nucleons/cm³ ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³. \n\nThis approach doesn't require knowing the molar mass or Avogadro's number, and it's based on the mass of individual nucleons. This seems more straightforward and physically accurate. \n\nSo I think this is the correct way to calculate n. Let me confirm with the iron example. If the density of iron is about 8 g/cm³, then the number of nucleons per cm³ would be 8 / (1.66×10^-24) ≈ 4.8×10^24, which matches the previous calculation using molar mass. Because for iron, with molar mass 56 g/mol, the number of nucleons per cm³ was also ~4.8×10^24. Therefore, this method works. \n\nGreat, so that's the way to go. Therefore, n = ρ / m_nucleon. \n\nGiven that, let's calculate n. \n\nFirst, m_nucleon ≈ 1.66×10^-24 g. \n\nSo n = 8 g/cm³ / 1.66×10^-24 g/nucleon ≈ 8 / 1.66 × 10^24 nucleons/cm³. \n\nCalculating 8 / 1.66 ≈ 4.819. Therefore, n ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³. \n\nOkay, so now we have the number density of target nucleons n ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of interactions. The formula is N = N₀ * σ * n * X, where:\n\n- N₀ is the initial number of neutrinos (100 million = 1×10^8)\n- σ is the cross-section (0.7×10^-38 cm²/nucleon)\n- n is the number density of nucleons (4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³)\n- X is the thickness of the material (1.0465×10^9 cm)\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nN = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 cm² * 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³ * 1.0465×10^9 cm\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the constants:\n\nMultiply 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 * 1.0465×10^9:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.7 * 4.82 * 1.0465 ≈ Let's calculate:\n\n0.7 * 4.82 = 3.374\n\n3.374 * 1.0465 ≈ Let's compute:\n\nFirst, 3.374 * 1 = 3.374\n\n3.374 * 0.04 = 0.13496\n\n3.374 * 0.0065 ≈ 0.021931\n\nAdding them up: 3.374 + 0.13496 ≈ 3.50896 + 0.021931 ≈ 3.5309\n\nSo approximately 3.53.\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\n10^-38 * 10^24 * 10^9 = 10^(-38 +24 +9) = 10^-5\n\nTherefore, the product is approximately 3.53×10^-5.\n\nThen, multiply by N₀ = 1×10^8:\n\nN ≈ 1×10^8 * 3.53×10^-5 = 3.53×10^(8-5) = 3.53×10^3 ≈ 3530.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the answer options are all below 100. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check my calculation again. \n\nWait, the formula is N = N₀ * σ * n * X. Let me check the units:\n\nσ has units cm²/nucleon, n has units nucleons/cm³, X has units cm. So multiplying σ * n * X gives (cm²/nucleon) * (nucleons/cm³) * cm = (cm² * nucleons * cm) / (nucleon * cm³) ) = cm^3 / cm^3 = dimensionless. Then multiplied by N₀ gives number of interactions. So units are correct. \n\nBut according to my calculation, N ≈ 3.53×10^3, which is 3530 interactions. But the answer options are A:98, B:35, C:73, D:14. That's way off. Clearly, I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, where did I go wrong? Let me check the numbers again. \n\nFirst, N₀ is 100 million, which is 1×10^8. Correct.\n\nσ is 0.7×10^-38 cm²/nucleon. Correct.\n\nn is 8 g/cm³ / 1.66×10^-24 g/nucleon ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³. Correct.\n\nX is the diameter in cm, which was 1.0465×10^9 cm. Correct.\n\nSo multiplying all together:\n\nN = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 * 1.0465×10^9 \n\nLet me compute the exponents first:\n\n10^8 * 10^-38 * 10^24 * 10^9 = 10^(8 -38 +24 +9) = 10^(3) = 1000.\n\nThen the constants:\n\n0.7 * 4.82 * 1.0465 ≈ 0.7 * 4.82 ≈ 3.374, then * 1.0465 ≈ 3.53 as before. \n\nSo total N ≈ 3.53 * 10^3 ≈ 3530. \n\nBut the answer options are all less than 100. That suggests that my calculation is wrong. But how? Maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check the calculation of n again. \n\nn = ρ / m_nucleon. \n\nρ is 8 g/cm³. \n\nm_nucleon is approximately 1.66×10^-24 g. \n\nSo n = 8 / 1.66×10^-24 ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³. That seems correct. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that the cross-section is per nucleon, but maybe I need to consider the number of nucleons per atom? No, the cross-section is already given per nucleon. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the neutrinos are passing through the entire planet, but the cross-section is given for 1-GeV neutrinos. However, the problem says \"1-GeV neutrinos\", and the cross-section is given as 0.7×10^-38 cm²/nucleon. Maybe I need to check if there's a missing factor here. \n\nWait, another thought: the formula for the number of interactions is N = N₀ * σ * N_target, where N_target is the total number of target nucleons. \n\nAlternatively, N_target is n * X * A, where A is the area? Wait, no. Wait, if the neutrinos are passing through a material of thickness X and cross-sectional area A, then the total number of target nucleons is n * X * A. However, the number of neutrinos passing through is N₀, assuming they all go through the cross-sectional area. However, in reality, the neutrinos are spread out, but since we're calculating the expected number of interactions, it's N₀ multiplied by the probability of interaction, which is σ * n * X. Therefore, N = N₀ * σ * n * X. Which is what I did. \n\nBut according to this, the answer is ~3500, which is way higher than the options. Therefore, I must have messed up some unit conversions. Let me check again. \n\nLet me recompute n. \n\nn = ρ / m_nucleon. \n\nρ is 8 g/cm³. \n\nm_nucleon is 1.66×10^-24 g. \n\nSo n = 8 / 1.66×10^-24 = 8 / 1.66 × 10^24 ≈ 4.819×10^24 nucleons/cm³. Correct. \n\nX is 1.0465×10^9 cm. Correct. \n\nσ is 0.7×10^-38 cm². Correct. \n\nN₀ is 1×10^8. Correct. \n\nSo multiplying all together:\n\nN = 1e8 * 0.7e-38 * 4.82e24 * 1.0465e9 \n\nLet me compute the exponents again:\n\n1e8 * 0.7e-38 = 0.7e-30 \n\nThen multiplied by 4.82e24: 0.7 * 4.82 = ~3.37, so 3.37e(-30 +24) = 3.37e-6 \n\nThen multiplied by 1.0465e9: 3.37e-6 * 1.0465e9 = 3.37 * 1.0465 * 1e3 ≈ 3.53 * 1000 ≈ 3530. \n\nSame result. \n\nBut the answer options are all below 100. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my calculation. \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the diameter conversion? Let me check that again. \n\nThe diameter is 10,465 km. Convert to cm:\n\n10,465 km * 1000 m/km = 10,465,000 m \n\n10,465,000 m * 100 cm/m = 1,046,500,000 cm = 1.0465×10^9 cm. Correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is using the radius instead of the diameter? If I mistakenly used radius instead of diameter... but no, the problem says \"pass through Tatooine\", so the thickness X should be the diameter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the density is given as 8 g/cm²? Wait, the problem says ρ ≈ 8 g/cm². Wait, hold on! Wait, the data says:\n\nData\n\nσ=0.7×10^{-38}cm^{2}/nucleon\n\nρ≈8g/cm^{2}\n\nWait, the user wrote ρ≈8g/cm². That is grams per square centimeter? That would be a surface density, not a volume density. That would make more sense if it's a column density. But that seems odd. Wait, if the density is given as 8 g/cm², that would be mass per area, not mass per volume. That would be unusual. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nData\n\nσ=0.7×10^{-38}cm^{2}/nucleon\n\nρ≈8g/cm^{2}\n\nAh! The density is given as 8 grams per square centimeter, not grams per cubic centimeter. That would be a column density, which is mass per area. That makes more sense for neutrino interactions, because the relevant quantity is the column density (mass per area), which when multiplied by the cross-section gives the interaction probability. \n\nWait, if ρ is 8 g/cm², then this is the mass per unit area, so to get the total mass, you multiply by area. But in neutrino interactions, the relevant quantity is the number of target nucleons along the path of the neutrino, which is column density. \n\nBut if ρ is given as 8 g/cm², that would be the mass per unit area. However, usually, density is mass per volume. There's a typo here? Maybe the user meant 8 g/cm³, but wrote 8 g/cm² by mistake. Because if it's 8 g/cm², then the calculation would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using ρ as the column density (mass per area), which is typically denoted as something else, like Σ (sigma), but let's see. \n\nIf ρ is 8 g/cm², then to find the number of nucleons per cm², we can do:\n\nmass per cm² is 8 g/cm². Number of nucleons per cm² is mass / mass per nucleon. So same as before, but since it's per cm², then the number density n would be 8 g/cm² / 1.66×10^-24 g/nucleon = 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm². \n\nBut then, the neutrinos pass through a thickness X, so the total column density would be n * X? Wait, no. If ρ is already the column density (mass per area), then the number of nucleons per area is ρ / m_nucleon. \n\nBut then, the neutrino cross-section is σ, so the interaction probability is σ * N_target, where N_target is the number of nucleons per area. \n\nTherefore, the number of interactions would be N = N₀ * σ * (ρ / m_nucleon). \n\nWait, let's think. If the neutrinos pass through a material with column density (mass per area) ρ, then the number of target nucleons per unit area is ρ / m_nucleon. The neutrino beam has N₀ neutrinos passing through an area A, so the total number of neutrinos is N₀ = (flux) * A, but if we assume all neutrinos pass through the area, then the total number of interactions is N = N₀ * σ * (ρ / m_nucleon). \n\nWait, but if ρ is mass per area, then ρ / m_nucleon is number of nucleons per area. Multiply by σ (area per nucleon) gives dimensionless interaction probability. Multiply by N₀ gives number of interactions. \n\nTherefore, N = N₀ * σ * (ρ / m_nucleon). \n\nLet me check units:\n\nσ [cm²/nucleon] * (ρ [g/cm²] / m_nucleon [g/nucleon]) ) = [cm²/nucleon] * [ (g/cm²) / (g/nucleon) ) ] = [cm²/nucleon] * [nucleon/cm²] = dimensionless. Multiply by N₀ gives number of interactions. Correct. \n\nTherefore, if ρ is given as 8 g/cm², then the calculation is:\n\nN = N₀ * σ * (ρ / m_nucleon)\n\nLet me compute this. \n\nFirst, calculate ρ / m_nucleon:\n\nρ = 8 g/cm²\n\nm_nucleon = 1.66×10^-24 g/nucleon\n\nSo ρ / m_nucleon = 8 / 1.66×10^-24 nucleons/cm² ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm²\n\nThen σ = 0.7×10^-38 cm²/nucleon\n\nTherefore, σ * (ρ / m_nucleon) = 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 ≈ 3.37×10^-14\n\nThen N = N₀ * 3.37×10^-14 = 1×10^8 * 3.37×10^-14 ≈ 3.37×10^-6\n\nWait, that's 3.37×10^-6 interactions? That would be less than one, which doesn't make sense. But the answer options are in the tens. \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate:\n\nσ = 0.7×10^-38 cm²/nucleon\n\nρ / m_nucleon = 8 / 1.66×10^-24 ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm²\n\nMultiply σ * (ρ / m_nucleon) = 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 = 0.7 * 4.82 × 10^(-38 +24) = 3.374 × 10^-14 \n\nThen N = N₀ * 3.374×10^-14 = 1×10^8 * 3.374×10^-14 ≈ 3.374×10^-6 ≈ 3.37×10^-6 \n\nThat is 0.00000337 interactions, which is way less than one. But the answer options are all above 10. \n\nThis suggests that there is a misunderstanding in the data provided. The original problem states ρ≈8g/cm², which is mass per area, but if we use that, the result is way too small. Alternatively, if the density is supposed to be 8 g/cm³, then we get N ≈ 3500, which is way too big. \n\nGiven that the answer options are between 10 and 100, maybe there is a miscalculation or a misinterpretation of the data. Let me check again.\n\nPossibly, the problem meant to give the density as 8 g/cm³, and there was a typo in the exponent. Let's assume that ρ is 8 g/cm³, and see if we can get an answer in the given options. \n\nEarlier, with ρ = 8 g/cm³, we had N ≈ 3.53×10^3. That's 3530 interactions. But the options are up to 98. So this is inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross-section is given incorrectly? The cross-section σ is 0.7×10^-38 cm²/nucleon. Let me check typical neutrino cross-sections. For 1 GeV neutrinos, the cross-section is on the order of 10^-38 cm² per nucleon. Yes, that seems reasonable. \n\nWait, let me check with different units. Maybe I made a mistake in the value of m_nucleon. \n\nThe mass of a nucleon is approximately 1.67×10^-24 g. Let me confirm:\n\n1 atomic mass unit (u) ≈ 1.66×10^-24 g. A nucleon has a mass of about 1 u, so yes, m_nucleon ≈ 1.66×10^-24 g. Correct.\n\nIf I use ρ = 8 g/cm³, then n = 8 / 1.66×10^-24 ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³. Then, the total number of target nucleons along the path is n * X * A, where A is the cross-sectional area. But the neutrino flux is N₀ passing through area A, so the number of interactions is N = N₀ * σ * n * X. \n\nBut since X is the diameter, and A is the cross-sectional area, but we don't know A. However, the problem says \"100 million 1-GeV neutrinos pass through Tatooine\". Assuming that all of them pass through the cross-sectional area, then the number of interactions is as calculated before, ~3500. But this is not among the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the neutrinos only interact with one layer of atoms, i.e., the number of target nucleons is the number in a 1 cm² area times the number of neutrinos? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is using the radius instead of the diameter? Let me check. If I use radius instead of diameter, X would be half, so N would be ~1750, still too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have a wrong value for σ? Let me check. The problem says σ=0.7×10^{-38}cm²/nucleon. If it were 0.7×10^{-44} cm², then the calculation would give a smaller number. Let me try that. \n\nIf σ were 0.7×10^-44 cm², then:\n\nN = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-44 * 4.82×10^24 * 1.0465×10^9 \n\nExponents: 10^8 * 10^-44 * 10^24 * 10^9 = 10^(8-44+24+9) = 10^(-3) \n\nConstants: 0.7 * 4.82 * 1.0465 ≈ 3.53 \n\nSo N ≈ 3.53×10^-3 ≈ 0.00353, still too small. \n\nAlternatively, if σ were 0.7×10^-34 cm², then exponents would be 10^(8-34+24+9)=10^7, N=3.53×10^7, which is way too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the Earth's density by mistake? Wait, the density of Earth is about 5.5 g/cm³, but here it's 8 g/cm³, which is plausible for a rocky planet. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the diameter conversion? Let me check again. \n\nDiameter is 10,465 km. \n\nConvert to cm: 10,465 km * 10^5 cm/km = 10,465 * 10^5 cm = 1.0465×10^9 cm. Correct. \n\nWait, 1 km = 10^5 cm? No, 1 km = 1000 m = 100,000 cm = 10^5 cm. Yes, correct. \n\nSo diameter is 1.0465×10^9 cm. Correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the number of neutrinos? It says 100 million, which is 1×10^8. Correct. \n\nWait, let me check the calculation again with ρ=8 g/cm³:\n\nN = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 * 1.0465×10^9 \n\nLet me compute it step by step with exact exponents:\n\nFirst, calculate 0.7 * 4.82 = 3.374\n\nThen 3.374 * 1.0465 ≈ 3.53 (as before)\n\nNow, exponents: 10^8 * 10^-38 is 10^-30, then * 10^24 is 10^-6, then * 10^9 is 10^3. \n\nSo 3.53 * 10^3 = 3530. \n\nBut the answer options are A:98, B:35, C:73, D:14. None of these are close. \n\nThis suggests that either there is a mistake in the problem data, or I made a wrong assumption. \n\nWait, let's go back to the data. The user wrote:\n\nData\n\nσ=0.7×10^{-38}cm^{2}/nucleon\n\nρ≈8g/cm^{2}\n\nAh! The density is 8 g/cm², which is grams per square centimeter, not grams per cubic centimeter. Let me try this again with ρ=8 g/cm². \n\nIf ρ is 8 g/cm², then this is the mass per unit area. To find the number of nucleons per unit area, we do ρ / m_nucleon = 8 g/cm² / 1.66×10^-24 g/nucleon ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm². \n\nThe cross-section σ is 0.7×10^-38 cm²/nucleon. \n\nThe number of interactions is N = N₀ * σ * (ρ / m_nucleon). \n\nWait, but this would be N = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 ≈ 1×10^8 * 3.37×10^-14 ≈ 3.37×10^-6. \n\nThis is about 0.00000337 interactions, which is less than one, which is not possible. But the answer options are in the tens. \n\nThis suggests that either the data is incorrect, or I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the density is meant to be 8 g/cm³, and the thickness is not the diameter, but the radius? Let me try that. \n\nIf X is the radius, then X = 1.0465×10^9 cm / 2 = 5.2325×10^8 cm. \n\nRecalculate N with X = 5.23×10^8 cm:\n\nN = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 * 5.23×10^8 \n\nCalculate exponents: 10^8 * 10^-38 * 10^24 * 10^8 = 10^(8-38+24+8) = 10^2 = 100.\n\nConstants: 0.7 * 4.82 * 5.23 ≈ 0.7 * 4.82 = 3.374; 3.374 * 5.23 ≈ 17.64. \n\nSo N ≈ 17.64 * 100 = 1764. Still too high. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the cross-section? Let me check typical neutrino cross-sections. For example, the weak interaction cross-section for neutrinos increases with energy, but for 1 GeV neutrinos, it is indeed on the order of 10^-38 cm² per nucleon. \n\nLet me look up a reference. For example, the neutrino-nucleon cross-section at 1 GeV is approximately σ ≈ 10^-38 cm². Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the given σ is reasonable. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is using the Earth's radius instead of diameter? No, we already tried that. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the number of neutrinos? It says 100 million, which is 1×10^8. If it were 1×10^4, then N would be 3530 * 1×10^4 / 1×10^8 = 0.0353, still too small. \n\nAlternatively, if the number of neutrinos is 1×10^11, then N would be 3530 * 1×10^11 / 1×10^8 = 353,000, which is way too high. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a missing factor of 10^something in the cross-section? If the cross-section were 0.7×10^-44 cm², then N would be 3.53×10^3 * 10^(-38+44) = 3.53×10^3 * 10^6 = 3.53×10^9, which is way too high. \n\nThis is very confusing. Given that the answer options are all below 100, and my calculation with ρ=8 g/cm³ gives ~3500, which is way higher, and with ρ=8 g/cm² gives ~0.000003, which is way lower, I must have made a wrong assumption. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is not asking for the total number of interactions through the entire planet, but through a single layer, or something else? Or perhaps the density is given as 8 g/cm², and the thickness is not needed? \n\nIf ρ is 8 g/cm², and we don't need to multiply by X, then N = N₀ * σ * (ρ / m_nucleon). \n\nWith ρ=8 g/cm², m_nucleon=1.66×10^-24 g, σ=0.7×10^-38 cm², N₀=1×10^8:\n\nN = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 * (8 / 1.66×10^-24) = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 = 1×10^8 * 3.37×10^-14 = 3.37×10^-6, as before. \n\nStill too small. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is using the density in kg/m³ instead of g/cm³? Let's try that. \n\nIf the density is given as 8 g/cm², but actually it should be 8 g/cm³, and there was a typo. Let's assume that, and redo the calculation with ρ=8 g/cm³, but this time, let's use the correct formula for column density. \n\nThe column density (mass per area) is ρ_volume * X, where ρ_volume is 8 g/cm³ and X is the thickness in cm. \n\nSo column density Σ = 8 g/cm³ * 1.0465×10^9 cm = 8.372×10^9 g/cm². \n\nThen, number of nucleons per cm² is Σ / m_nucleon = 8.372×10^9 g/cm² / 1.66×10^-24 g/nucleon ≈ 5.04×10^33 nucleons/cm². \n\nThen, the number of interactions is N = N₀ * σ * Σ_nucleons, where Σ_nucleons is the number of nucleons per cm². \n\nSo N = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 cm² * 5.04×10^33 nucleons/cm² = 1×10^8 * 0.7×5.04×10^(-38+33) = 1×10^8 * 3.528×10^-5 = 3.528×10^3 = 3528. \n\nSame as before, ~3500. Still too high. \n\nWait, but the answer options are A:98, B:35, C:73, D:14. None of these. \n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is given per nucleus, not per nucleon? If the cross-section is per nucleus, and assuming that each nucleus has A nucleons, then the number of interactions would be different. But the problem states it's per nucleon. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the density is 8 g/cm³, but uses a different value for the number of nucleons per gram. For example, if instead of using m_nucleon = 1.66×10^-24 g, they use a different value. Let me try with m_nucleon = 1.67×10^-27 kg = 1.67×10^-24 g. Wait, that's what I did before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using kilograms instead of grams? Let me try that. \n\nIf ρ is 8 g/cm³ = 8000 kg/m³. But if someone mistakenly used kg instead of grams, let's see. \n\nBut this is too convoluted. \n\nWait, let me check the initial problem statement again. \n\nThe problem says: \"If 100 million 1-GeV neutrinos pass through Tatooine, how many will interact?\"\n\nData:\n\nσ=0.7×10^{-38}cm^{2}/nucleon\n\nρ≈8g/cm^{2}\n\nWait, maybe the user made a typo, and the density is 8 g/cm³, and the cross-section is 0.7×10^{-44} cm²/nucleon? Let's try that. \n\nIf σ=0.7×10^{-44} cm²/nucleon, and ρ=8 g/cm³, then:\n\nn = 8 / 1.66×10^-24 ≈ 4.82×10^24 nucleons/cm³\n\nX = 1.0465×10^9 cm\n\nN = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-44 * 4.82×10^24 * 1.0465×10^9 \n\nExponents: 10^8 * 10^-44 * 10^24 * 10^9 = 10^(8-44+24+9) = 10^(-3) \n\nConstants: 0.7 * 4.82 * 1.0465 ≈ 3.53 \n\nSo N ≈ 3.53×10^-3 ≈ 0.00353, still too small. \n\nAlternatively, if the cross-section is 0.7×10^{-34} cm², then exponents would be 10^(8-34+24+9) = 10^7, N=3.53×10^4 = 35,300, which is still too high. \n\nWait, the answer options are around 35-98. If the correct answer is 35, then maybe the calculation should give approximately 35. Let me see what needs to change to get that. \n\nLet me set N = 35, and solve for what parameter needs to change. \n\nFrom N = N₀ * σ * n * X = 35. \n\nWe have N₀ = 1×10^8, σ = 0.7×10^-38, n = 4.82×10^24, X = 1.0465×10^9. \n\nSo 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-38 * 4.82×10^24 * 1.0465×10^9 = 3.53×10^3. \n\nTo get 35 instead of 3.53×10^3, we need to reduce this by a factor of 100. That would mean reducing one of the parameters by a factor of 100. \n\nIf the cross-section were 0.7×10^-40 instead of -38, then N would be 3.53×10^3 * 10^-2 = 35.3. That would give N ≈ 35, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, if the density were 8 g/cm³ but the thickness was 10^7 cm instead of 10^9 cm, that would also reduce by a factor of 100. \n\nBut the diameter of Tatooine is given as 10,465 km, which is 1.0465×10^9 cm. If it were 10,465 m, that would be 1.0465×10^5 cm, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, if the number of neutrinos was 1×10^6 instead of 1×10^8, then N would be 3.53×10^3 * (1×10^6 / 1×10^8) = 35.3. \n\nBut the problem states 100 million, which is 1×10^8. \n\nThis suggests that there might be a typo in the problem, where either the number of neutrinos is 1×10^6, or the cross-section is 0.7×10^-40, or the diameter is 10,465 m instead of km. \n\nGiven that the answer options include B:35, it's plausible that the intended answer is 35, and there was a mistake in the problem's data. \n\nAssuming that there is a typo and the cross-section is 0.7×10^-40 cm²/nucleon instead of -38, then the calculation would give N ≈ 35.3, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, if the number of neutrinos is 1×10^6, then with the original cross-section, N ≈ 3.53, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the diameter is 10,465 m (10.465 km), which is much smaller, then X = 1.0465×10^5 cm, and N = 3.53×10^3 * (1.0465×10^5 / 1.0465×10^9) = 3.53×10^3 * 10^-4 = 0.353, still not matching. \n\nAlternatively, if the density is 8 g/cm³, but the problem assumes that the number of nucleons is calculated using molar mass and Avogadro's number with a molar mass of 2 g/mol, for example. Let's try that. \n\nIf the material has a molar mass of 2 g/mol, then number of moles per cm³ is 8 / 2 = 4 mol/cm³. Number of atoms per cm³ is 4 * 6.022×10^23 = 2.4088×10^24 atoms/cm³. Assuming each atom has 2 nucleons (like helium), then number of nucleons per cm³ is 2.4088×10^24 * 2 = 4.8176×10^24 nucleons/cm³, which is the same as before. So no change. \n\nTherefore, this approach doesn't help. \n\nGiven that, and given that the answer options include 35, I think the most plausible explanation is that there was a typo in the cross-section, and it should be 0.7×10^-40 cm² instead of -38. With that, the calculation gives N ≈ 35.3, which is option B:35. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem intended the density to be 8 g/cm² and the cross-section to be 0.7×10^-34 cm², then N = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-34 * 4.82×10^24 = 3.37×10^8 * 10^-10 = 3.37×10^-2, still too small. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem intended the density to be 8 g/cm³ and the cross-section to be 0.7×10^-34 cm², then N = 1×10^8 * 0.7×10^-34 * 4.82×10^24 * 1.0465×10^9 = 3.53×10^8 * 10^(-34+24+9) = 3.53×10^8 * 10^-1 = 3.53×10^7, which is 35,300,000, way too high. \n\nGiven all this, I think the most plausible conclusion is that there was a typo in the cross-section's exponent, and it should be -40 instead of -38, leading to N ≈ 35. Therefore, the answer is B:35. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem intended to use the density as 8 g/cm² and some other parameter, but I can't see a way to get to the answer options with the given data. \n\nGiven the options and the calculations, I'll go with option B:35, assuming a typo in the cross-section's exponent.\n</think>"}
