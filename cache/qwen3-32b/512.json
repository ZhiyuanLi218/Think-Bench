The question is about tritium, which is denoted as _1^2 H. Wait, actually, tritium is usually _1^3 H, right? Because tritium has one proton and two neutrons, making the mass number 3. But here the question says _1^2 H is tritium. Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me check again.\n\nThe standard notation for isotopes is _Z^A X, where Z is the atomic number (protons) and A is the mass number (protons + neutrons). So for hydrogen isotopes: protium is _1^1 H (1 proton, 0 neutrons), deuterium is _1^2 H (1 proton, 1 neutron), and tritium is _1^3 H (1 proton, 2 neutrons). So if the question says tritium is _1^2 H, that's actually deuterium. Maybe there's a mistake in the question? Or maybe it's a trick question to test understanding?\n\nAssuming the question is correct as given, and tritium is _1^2 H, then we need to evaluate the options based on that. But if it's a typo and they meant _1^3 H, then the answer might be different. Let me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's take the given notation as correct: tritium is _1^2 H. So mass number A is 2, atomic number Z is 1. Neutron number N is A - Z = 2 -1 =1. But wait, tritium normally has 2 neutrons. If the notation is wrong, then the options might be incorrect as well. Let me check each option.\n\nOption A: Neutron number of _1^2 H is 2. If A is 2, Z is 1, then neutrons N = 2-1=1. So A is wrong. But if the actual isotope was _1^3 H (tritium), then N would be 3-1=2, so A would be correct. But the question says tritium is _1^2 H. So if we take that as given, A is wrong.\n\nOption B: Nuclear charge number is 1. Nuclear charge number is the same as the atomic number, which is the number of protons. For hydrogen, Z=1, so yes, B is correct regardless of the isotope.\n\nOption C: _1^2 H is the lightest atom in nature. The lightest atom would be protium (_1^1 H), with mass number 1. Deuterium (_1^2 H) has a higher mass, so C is incorrect. If the question had _1^1 H, then C would be correct, but not deuterium.\n\nOption D: _1^2 H is an allotrope of hydrogen. Allotropes are different forms of the same element in the same state. For hydrogen, the main isotopes are protium, deuterium, and tritium. However, isotopes are not considered allotropes. Allotropes are like oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3). So isotopes are different in the number of neutrons, while allotropes are different in the arrangement of atoms. Therefore, D is incorrect. Isotopes are different nuclides, not allotropes.\n\nSo if the question is correct in calling _1^2 H as tritium (which is actually deuterium), then the correct answer is B. But if the question had a typo and meant _1^3 H as tritium, then A would be correct (neutron number 2), B still correct, C still incorrect, D incorrect. But the options given are A, B, C, D. The question says \"the following statements are correct,\" so possibly multiple correct? But the user didn't specify if it's multiple choice. However, looking at the options, in Chinese tests, sometimes multiple options can be correct. Let me check again.\n\nIf the question is correct, and the given isotope is _1^2 H (deuterium), then B is correct. So answer is B. However, if the question is wrong and they meant tritium as _1^3 H, then A and B would be correct. But since the question says tritium is _1^2 H, we have to go with that. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. The notation _Z^A X, so _1^2 H is deuterium. Tritium is _1^3 H. The question's premise is that tritium is _1^2 H, which is incorrect. However, the options are based on that notation. So the options are about _1^2 H being tritium, but regardless of the name, the nuclear data is based on the isotope. So for _1^2 H, neutron number is 1 (A is wrong), nuclear charge is 1 (B is correct), lightest atom? No, because protium is lighter (C is wrong), and D is wrong because isotopes are not allotropes. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
