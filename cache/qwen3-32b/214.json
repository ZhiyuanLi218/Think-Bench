So, the question is about the ratio of the Sun's gravitational force on the Moon compared to the Earth's gravitational force on the Moon. The given data is that the distance from the Sun to the Earth is 390 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon, and the Moon's orbital period around the Earth is 27 days. The options are 0.2, 2, 20, or 200. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Newton's law of universal gravitation. The gravitational force between two objects is given by F = G * (M * m) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. \n\nSo, the Sun's gravitational force on the Moon (F_sun) would be G * (M_sun * M_moon) / r_sun_moon². The Earth's gravitational force on the Moon (F_earth) is G * (M_earth * M_moon) / r_earth_moon². The ratio F_sun / F_earth would then be [M_sun / M_earth] * [r_earth_moon / r_sun_moon]². \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the ratio of the distance from the Sun to the Earth (which is the same as the distance from the Sun to the Moon, since the Earth-Moon distance is much smaller than the Sun-Earth distance) to the Earth-Moon distance is 390. So, r_sun_earth / r_earth_moon = 390. Therefore, r_sun_moon ≈ r_sun_earth ≈ 390 * r_earth_moon. \n\nSo substituting that into the ratio, we get [M_sun / M_earth] * [1 / (390)²]. But I don't know the ratio of the Sun's mass to the Earth's mass off the top of my head. However, maybe I can use Kepler's third law or the information about the Moon's orbital period to find this ratio?\n\nWait, the Moon's orbital period around the Earth is 27 days. Let me recall that Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. For the Earth-Moon system, the period T is related to the distance r by T² = (4π² / G M_earth) * r³. But maybe I can use this to find the mass of the Earth relative to the Sun?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the Earth orbits the Sun with a period of 1 year. Using Kepler's third law for the Earth's orbit around the Sun, we can relate the Sun's mass to the Earth's orbital parameters. Let me think.\n\nLet me write down the expressions. For the Moon orbiting the Earth:\n\nT_moon² = (4π² / G M_earth) * r_earth_moon³.\n\nFor the Earth orbiting the Sun:\n\nT_earth² = (4π² / G M_sun) * r_sun_earth³.\n\nIf I take the ratio of these two equations, maybe I can find M_sun / M_earth.\n\nSo, [T_moon² / T_earth²] = [ (4π² / G M_earth) * r_earth_moon³ ] / [ (4π² / G M_sun) * r_sun_earth³ ] = [M_sun / M_earth] * [r_earth_moon³ / r_sun_earth³].\n\nTherefore, rearranging:\n\nM_sun / M_earth = [T_moon² / T_earth²] * [r_sun_earth³ / r_earth_moon³].\n\nWe know T_moon is 27 days, T_earth is 1 year. Let's convert them to the same units. Let's say T_earth is 365 days. So T_moon is 27 days, T_earth is 365 days. The ratio (T_moon / T_earth)² is (27 / 365)² ≈ (0.074)² ≈ 0.0055.\n\nThe ratio [r_sun_earth / r_earth_moon]^3 is 390³. Because the problem states that r_sun_earth / r_earth_moon is 390. So 390³ is approximately (400)³ = 64,000,000, but since it's 390, which is 39*10, so 39³ is 59319, so 39³ * 10³ = 59319 * 1000 = 59,319,000. Let me check 390³:\n\n390 * 390 = 152,100; then 152,100 * 390. Let me compute 152,100 * 300 = 45,630,000; 152,100 * 90 = 13,689,000. Total is 45,630,000 + 13,689,000 = 59,319,000. Yes, so 390³ is 59,319,000.\n\nSo putting it all together, M_sun / M_earth ≈ 0.0055 * 59,319,000 ≈ Let me calculate 0.0055 * 59,319,000. \n\nFirst, 0.0055 * 59,319,000 = 59,319,000 * 5.5 / 1000 = 59,319,000 * 0.0055. Let me compute 59,319,000 * 0.005 = 296,595. Then 59,319,000 * 0.0005 = 29,659.5. So total is 296,595 + 29,659.5 ≈ 326,254.5. So approximately 3.26 x 10^5.\n\nTherefore, the Sun's mass is about 326,254 times the Earth's mass. \n\nNow, going back to the original ratio of the gravitational forces:\n\nF_sun / F_earth = (M_sun / M_earth) * (r_earth_moon / r_sun_earth)^2 = 326,254 * (1 / 390)^2.\n\nLet me compute (1 / 390)^2 ≈ 1 / 152,100 ≈ 6.57 x 10^-6.\n\nThen multiplying by 326,254:\n\n326,254 * 6.57 x 10^-6 ≈ Let's calculate 326,254 * 6.57 / 1,000,000.\n\nFirst, approximate 326,254 * 6.57 ≈ Let me do 326,254 * 6 = 1,957,524, 326,254 * 0.57 ≈ 326,254 * 0.5 = 163,127 and 326,254 * 0.07 ≈ 22,837.8. Total ≈ 163,127 + 22,837.8 ≈ 185,964.8. So total is 1,957,524 + 185,964.8 ≈ 2,143,488.8. Then divide by 1,000,000 ≈ 2.143. So approximately 2.14. \n\nSo the ratio is approximately 2.14. Looking at the options, that's closest to option (B) 2. \n\nBut wait, I need to check if my approximations are correct. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nFirst, the mass ratio M_sun / M_earth ≈ 326,254. Let me recall that the actual mass of the Sun is about 333,000 times that of the Earth. So my approximate calculation of 326,000 is close. So that's okay.\n\nThen, (1/390)^2 is 1/(390*390). 390*390 is 152,100 as before. So 1/152,100 ≈ 6.575 x 10^-6. Multiply by 3.26 x 10^5 gives 3.26 x 10^5 * 6.575 x 10^-6 ≈ 3.26 * 6.575 * 10^(-1). Let me compute 3.26 * 6.575.\n\nFirst, 3 * 6.575 = 19.725. Then 0.26 * 6.575 ≈ 1.71. So total ≈ 19.725 + 1.71 ≈ 21.435. Then multiply by 10^-1: 2.1435. So yes, approximately 2.14. So the ratio is about 2.14, which is closest to option (B) 2.\n\nBut wait, I remember that the actual ratio of the Sun's gravitational force on the Moon to the Earth's gravitational force on the Moon is about 2.2, so this seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be (B) 2. \n\nBut let me check if there was an error in the calculation steps. Another way to approach this is to use the fact that the gravitational force is proportional to mass over distance squared. So if we can find the ratio of the Sun's mass to Earth's mass, and the ratio of distances, we can compute the force ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way using the orbital periods and the given data without going through the mass ratios. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, since the Moon is orbiting the Earth, and the Earth-Moon system is orbiting the Sun. The Sun's gravity is actually a perturbing force on the Moon's orbit. However, the question is simply about the magnitude of the forces. So, the ratio of the Sun's force to Earth's force on the Moon is (F_sun / F_earth) = (G M_sun M_moon / r_sun_moon²) / (G M_earth M_moon / r_earth_moon²) ) = (M_sun / M_earth) * (r_earth_moon / r_sun_moon)^2. \n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. And since r_sun_moon ≈ r_sun_earth, we can use 390 as the ratio. \n\nBut another way to think about it is using the concept of centripetal acceleration. For example, the Earth's gravitational force provides the centripetal force for the Moon's orbit. Similarly, the Sun's gravitational force would provide the centripetal force if the Moon were orbiting the Sun directly. But in reality, the Moon is orbiting the Earth, so maybe we can compare the accelerations?\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that for the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the centripetal acceleration is provided by the Sun's gravity. Similarly, for the Moon's orbit around the Earth, the centripetal acceleration is provided by Earth's gravity. \n\nBut perhaps that's complicating things. Let me stick with the previous method. \n\nSo, given that the ratio comes out to approximately 2, and the options are 0.2, 2, 20, 200. So answer is (B) 2. \n\nWait, but I remember that sometimes when you calculate the ratio of gravitational forces, you have to consider that the Earth and Moon are both orbiting the Sun, so there might be some cancellation of forces. However, the question is asking for the ratio of the Sun's gravitational force on the Moon to the Earth's gravitational force on the Moon, regardless of their orbital dynamics. So it's just a matter of the masses and distances. \n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 2. Hence, the answer is B.\n</think>"}
