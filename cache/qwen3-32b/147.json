{"question":"Question: In the 1960s, China achieved breakthrough development in cutting-edge technology mainly for national defense. In 1964, China's first atomic bomb test was successful; in 1967, China's first hydrogen bomb test was successful.

Understanding the distinction between nuclear fission and fusion is key to answering this.\n\n---\n\n**Nuclear Fission** is the process where a heavy nucleus (such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239) splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This is the principle used in **atomic bombs**. The first atomic bombs developed during World War II and the one tested by China in 1964 operated on fission reactions.\n\n**Nuclear Fusion**, on the other hand, involves combining two light nuclei (such as isotopes of hydrogen) to form a heavier nucleus, also releasing a vast amount of energy. This is the process that powers stars, including our Sun. **Hydrogen bombs** (also known as thermonuclear weapons) are primarily based on this principle. However, it's important to note that fusion requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to initiate, which are typically generated by a fission reaction. So, while a fission reaction is used to *trigger* the fusion process in hydrogen bombs, the *primary* source of energy is the fusion reaction.\n\n---\n\nGiven this, the correct statement is:\n\n**(C) The atomic bomb is developed based on the principle of nuclear fission, while the hydrogen bomb is developed based on the principle of nuclear fusion.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the primary scientific basis for each type of weapon.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about the principles behind atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. I remember that nuclear weapons work on different types of nuclear reactions. So, first, I need to recall the difference between nuclear fission and fusion.\n\nNuclear fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, releasing energy. That's what I think atomic bombs use. Like, the ones dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fission-based, right? They used uranium or plutonium. \n\nThen there's nuclear fusion, which is when light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy. The sun does this with hydrogen turning into helium. Hydrogen bombs, or thermonuclear bombs, are supposed to use fusion. But wait, I've heard that they might use fission to trigger the fusion. So maybe the hydrogen bomb uses both processes? The primary stage is fission to create the high temperature and pressure needed for the fusion in the secondary stage. \n\nSo the question is asking which statement is correct. The options are:\n\nA) Both use fission.\nB) Both use fusion.\nC) Atomic bomb fission, hydrogen bomb fusion.\nD) Opposite of C.\n\nBut if hydrogen bombs use fusion as their main source, even though they might use fission to initiate it, then option C would be correct. The atomic bomb is purely fission-based. So the answer should be C. Let me double-check. Yes, atomic bombs are fission, hydrogen bombs are fusion-based, even though they use fission triggers. So the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
