So, we have a substance F, and we need to determine the number of hydrogen atoms in it based on the given reactions and NMR information. The answer options are A:7, B:5, C:3, D:10. Let me start by going through each step of the synthesis to understand what each compound is.\n\nFirst, the first reaction is Benzene + Cl2/FeCl3 → A. That sounds like a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or maybe a halogenation. Wait, benzene reacting with Cl2 in the presence of FeCl3 is typically chlorination. So, the product A should be chlorobenzene. Because FeCl3 acts as a catalyst for electrophilic substitution here. So, A is chlorobenzene. Let me confirm: benzene + Cl2 with FeCl3 gives chlorobenzene. Yes, that's right.\n\nNext reaction: Benzene + HNO3, H2SO4 at 60°C → B. This is nitration. The nitronium ion is generated from HNO3 and H2SO4, and at 60°C, which is a moderate temperature, the nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene. So B is nitrobenzene. Because nitration at higher temperatures might lead to multiple substitutions, but here it's just one equivalent. So B is nitrobenzene.\n\nThird reaction: A (chlorobenzene) + 2 HNO3/H2SO4 at 120°C → C. So chlorobenzene undergoing nitration twice? But wait, nitration is usually done with HNO3/H2SO4. Chlorobenzene is less reactive than benzene towards electrophilic substitution because Cl is electron-withdrawing. However, with strong conditions, maybe it can undergo nitration. At 120°C, which is higher than the previous nitration. Since two moles of HNO3 are used, maybe two nitro groups are added? But where would they go? Chlorine is a meta director. So if we nitrate chlorobenzene, the nitro group would go to the meta position relative to Cl. Then if we nitrate again, another nitro would go to the meta position relative to the first nitro? Let me think.\n\nChlorobenzene has Cl in the ring. First nitration would put a nitro group in the meta position to Cl. Then, the second nitro would be influenced by both Cl and the existing nitro group. Since Cl is meta-directing and nitro is also meta-directing, but nitro is a stronger deactivator. So the second nitro would go to the meta position relative to the first nitro. Let me draw this mentally. Let's say Cl is at position 1. First nitro at position 3 (meta to Cl). Then the second nitro would be meta to position 3, which would be position 5. So positions 1: Cl, 3: NO2, 5: NO2. So C is 1-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzene? Or maybe 2,4-dinitro? Wait, maybe I need to check the directing effects again.\n\nWait, chlorobenzene's Cl is an ortho/para director? Wait, no. Wait, Cl is an electron-withdrawing group through induction but has a lone pair that can donate through resonance. Wait, but for halogens, they are ortho/para directors but deactivating. However, when you have a nitro group, which is a meta director. So when you have a chlorobenzene, and you add a nitro group, the nitro will go to the meta position relative to Cl. Let me confirm: the directing effect of Cl is ortho/para, but since it's electron-withdrawing, maybe the nitro group (which is a strong meta director) would actually go to the meta position? Wait, no. Wait, the directing effect of Cl is ortho/para. So if you nitrate chlorobenzene, the nitro group would go to the ortho or para positions relative to Cl? Wait, but Cl is electron-withdrawing, so maybe the reaction is less likely? But with strong conditions, it can still happen. Wait, maybe the nitro group is added to the para position? Let me check standard reactions. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene typically gives a mixture of ortho and para nitro products, but since the nitro group is a strong meta director, maybe after the first nitration, the second nitration would be directed by the existing groups. Wait, but the question says 2 HNO3, so two nitro groups. Let me think again.\n\nIf we start with chlorobenzene, and add two nitro groups under strong conditions. Let me check the positions. If the first nitro is added to the para position of Cl, then the second nitro would be influenced by Cl (ortho/para) and the first nitro (meta). Let me consider that. If Cl is at 1, first nitro at 4 (para). Then the second nitro would be meta to the first nitro (position 4), so meta would be 1 and 7 (but 7 is same as 1). Wait, positions are 1-6. So meta to 4 would be positions 1 and 6? Wait, position 4's meta positions are 1 and 6? Wait, no. In a benzene ring, each carbon has ortho, meta, para positions. For carbon 4, ortho would be 3 and 5, para is 1, meta is 2 and 6. Wait, maybe I need to draw it. Let me imagine positions:\n\n1 - Cl\n\nThen positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nIf first nitro is at para to Cl, which is position 4. Then the existing substituents are Cl (position 1) and NO2 (position 4). Now, adding another nitro. The directing effects: Cl is ortho/para, NO2 is meta. So the next nitro would go to positions that are both ortho/para to Cl and not meta to NO2? Wait, conflicting directions. Let me think. The Cl (position 1) would direct nitro to ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4), but position 4 already has a nitro. The existing NO2 at position 4 is a meta director, so it would direct the next nitro to positions meta to it, which are 1 and 6. But position 1 has Cl. So possible positions would be 6? Because position 1 is already occupied by Cl. So maybe the second nitro would be at position 6. Then the compound would have Cl at 1, NO2 at 4 and 6. So 1-chloro-4,6-dinitrobenzene? Or maybe another arrangement. Alternatively, maybe the first nitro is at ortho to Cl, say position 2. Then the second nitro would be influenced by Cl (ortho/para) and the first nitro (meta). Let's see. If Cl is at 1 and first nitro at 2, then the second nitro would be meta to nitro (position 2's meta is 5 and 6?), but also considering Cl's direction. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Since the reaction uses 2 HNO3, maybe it's a disubstitution. But I need to figure out the structure of C. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that after two nitrations, the nitro groups are in positions that lead to some symmetry in the final product F. Let me hold onto that thought and move to the next reactions to see if that helps.\n\nNext reaction: B (nitrobenzene) + Fe/HCl → D. This is a reduction reaction. Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline. Fe/HCl is a classic method for reducing nitro groups to amino groups. So D is aniline (C6H5NH2).\n\nThen, C + D in ethanol, heating, and loss of HCl → E. So C is the dinitrochlorobenzene, and D is aniline. So perhaps a nucleophilic substitution or a coupling reaction? But aniline is a nucleophile. Maybe the Cl in C is replaced by the amino group from D? But aniline is not a strong enough nucleophile to displace Cl from an aromatic ring under normal conditions. Wait, but maybe in the presence of alcohol and heating, and with the loss of HCl, it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution? For that, the ring would need to have good leaving groups and activating groups. Wait, C has two nitro groups and a Cl. The nitro groups are electron-withdrawing, which might make the ring less reactive. Alternatively, maybe it's a condensation reaction? Or maybe an acylation? Wait, the reaction is in ethanol, so maybe EtOH is the solvent. The product E is formed with loss of HCl. Let me think. If C is a chloro-dinitrobenzene and D is aniline, maybe they react to form an amide? But how? If the Cl is replaced by an amine group. For example, if C has Cl and two nitro groups, and D is aniline, then maybe the Cl is substituted by the aniline's NH2 group. But for that, it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S_NAr). However, for S_NAr to occur, the ring must have strong electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the leaving group. Since C has two nitro groups, if they are adjacent to the Cl, that could facilitate the reaction. For example, if the nitro groups are in the ortho and para positions relative to Cl, then the leaving group (Cl) is in a position where the nitro groups can stabilize the negative charge in the transition state. Let me go back to the structure of C. If C is 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, then the Cl is adjacent to two nitro groups (ortho and para?), which would make it a good candidate for S_NAr. But earlier, I was confused about the positions of nitro in C. Let me try to figure out the correct structure of C.\n\nStarting with A: chlorobenzene. Then nitration twice. Let's assume that the first nitration is at para position (position 4) relative to Cl (position 1). Then the second nitration would be... Let me consider the directing effects again. After first nitration at para (position 4), the existing substituents are Cl (position 1) and NO2 (position 4). Now, for the second nitration, the directing effects: Cl is ortho/para, NO2 is meta. The possible positions for the next nitro would be where both substituents allow. The Cl would direct to ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4, already taken). The NO2 at position 4 would direct meta (positions 1 and 6). So overlapping positions are 6. Therefore, the second nitro would go to position 6. So C would be 1-chloro-4,6-dinitrobenzene. Alternatively, if the first nitro is in the ortho position, say position 2, then the second nitro would be directed by Cl (ortho/para) and the first nitro (meta). Let's see. If Cl is at 1 and first nitro at 2, then the second nitro would be meta to nitro (positions 5 and 6?), and also ortho/para to Cl. Cl's ortho positions are 2 and 6, para is 4. The first nitro is at 2, so meta to it would be 5 and 6. So overlapping positions would be 6. Therefore, the second nitro would be at 6. So C would be 1-chloro-2,6-dinitrobenzene. Wait, but in that case, the nitro groups are at positions 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. Alternatively, if the first nitro is at position 3 (meta to Cl), but Cl is a ortho/para director. Wait, why would the first nitro go to meta? It shouldn't. The first nitration of chlorobenzene should go to ortho or para. So maybe the correct structure is 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene? Wait, but how?\n\nLet me check standard reactions. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene typically gives a mixture of ortho and para products. However, with two nitro groups, the positions would depend on the order. Let me think. Let's say first nitro is para (position 4), then second nitro is at 6 (as discussed). So 1-chloro-4,6-dinitrobenzene. Alternatively, if first nitro is ortho (position 2), then second nitro is 6. So 1-chloro-2,6-dinitrobenzene. Both possibilities. But which one is more likely? Maybe the problem is designed such that the nitro groups are in positions that allow for symmetry in the final product. Let's hold that thought and move forward.\n\nNow, reaction of C with D (aniline) in ethanol, heating, and loss of HCl to form E. If C is a chloro-dinitrobenzene, and D is aniline, then maybe the Cl is replaced by an NH2 group from aniline. So if C is 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, then substitution of Cl by NH2 would give 2,4-dinitroaniline. But how would that happen? If the Cl is in position 1, and the nitro groups are in 2 and 4, then substitution would give 2,4-dinitroaniline. Alternatively, if C is 1-chloro-2,6-dinitrobenzene, substitution would give 2,6-dinitroaniline. Depending on the structure of C, E would be different. Let's proceed with the assumption that C is 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Then E would be 2,4-dinitroaniline. Alternatively, maybe C is 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene? No, because only two nitro groups are added. Wait, the reaction is A + 2 HNO3 → C. So two nitro groups. So C is dichloro... no, A is chlorobenzene. So C is chlorobenzene with two nitro groups. So dichloro? No, only one Cl. So one Cl and two nitro.\n\nAssuming that, then E is the substituted aniline. Now, moving on. Then E + x HNO3/H2SO4 → F. So E is some dinitroaniline, and then further nitration gives F. The problem says that in the 1H NMR of F, there are only two signals, one of which disappears upon D2O addition. The disappearance upon D2O addition suggests that there's an exchangeable proton, likely an NH or OH group. So one of the signals is from an NH group. Therefore, F probably has some symmetry so that the aromatic protons are in equivalent positions, leading to only two signals (one aromatic, one NH or something else).\n\nLet me try to outline possible structures. Let's suppose that E is 2,4-dinitroaniline. Then nitration of E would add another nitro group. But where? The existing substituents on the ring are two nitro groups and an amino group. The amino group is an ortho/para director, but nitro groups are meta directors. Let's consider the directing effects. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong activating group and ortho/para director. The nitro groups (-NO2) are deactivating and meta directors. So when nitration occurs, the nitro group would be directed by the amino group and the existing nitro groups. Let's say E is 2,4-dinitroaniline (structure: NH2 at position 1, NO2 at 2 and 4). Then, the nitration would be directed by the NH2 (ortho/para to it) and the existing nitro groups (which are at 2 and 4). Let's see. The NH2 is at position 1. The ortho positions to NH2 are 2 and 6, para is 4. But positions 2 and 4 already have nitro groups. The para position (4) is already occupied. The ortho positions (2 and 6): position 2 has a nitro, which is a meta director. So if we try to nitrate, the NH2 would direct to ortho/para, but existing nitro groups might block or direct. This is getting complicated. Maybe the nitration adds a nitro group at position 6? Let's see. Position 6 is ortho to NH2 (position 1). So if we add a nitro at 6, then the structure would be NH2 at 1, NO2 at 2,4,6. That would be 2,4,6-trinitroaniline, which is called trinitroaniline, but more commonly known as 2,4,6-trinitroaniline, which is actually picric acid? Wait, no, picric acid is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Trinitroaniline is a different compound. Anyway, if F is 2,4,6-trinitroaniline, then its structure would have three nitro groups and an amino group. Let's check the NMR. The aromatic protons in this case: since the ring has three nitro groups at 2,4,6, and an NH2 at 1. The aromatic ring would have protons at positions 3 and 5? Wait, positions 1: NH2, 2,4,6: NO2. The remaining positions are 3 and 5. But wait, in a benzene ring with substituents at 1,2,4,6, the remaining positions are 3 and 5. However, each of these positions would be adjacent to nitro groups. Let me check symmetry. If the nitro groups are at 2,4,6 and NH2 at 1, then positions 3 and 5 are symmetric? Because the ring is symmetric with respect to the axis through 1 and the center. Wait, position 3 and 5 would be equivalent? If the nitro groups are at 2,4,6, then positions 3 and 5 are each adjacent to a nitro group (position 3 is between 2 and 4, which are both nitro; position 5 is between 4 and 6, which are nitro). Wait, actually, positions 3 and 5 would each be between two nitro groups. But due to the symmetry of the molecule (since nitro groups are at 2,4,6 and NH2 at 1), positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. Therefore, the aromatic protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent, giving one signal. Then the NH2 protons would give another signal, which would disappear in D2O. So total two signals, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, F would be 2,4,6-trinitroaniline. Let me check the hydrogen count. The structure is C6H2(NO2)3NH2. Wait, let's count the hydrogens. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Each carbon can have H. But with substituents. Let's write the formula. The molecule has:\n\n- 6 carbon atoms in the ring.\n\n- 3 nitro groups (-NO2), each contributing 2 oxygen atoms and 1 nitrogen.\n\n- 1 amino group (-NH2).\n\nNow, the hydrogens:\n\nThe ring has some hydrogens. Let's consider the structure:\n\nPositions 1: NH2\n\nPositions 2,4,6: NO2\n\nPositions 3 and 5: each has a hydrogen? Because there are no substituents there. Wait, if the ring has substituents at 1,2,4,6, then positions 3 and 5 are each a CH group? Or maybe CH2? No, in benzene, each carbon is CH. If substituents are at 1,2,4,6, then positions 3 and 5 would each have a hydrogen. So the aromatic ring would have two hydrogens, each at positions 3 and 5. Plus the NH2 group has two hydrogens. So total hydrogens in F would be 2 (aromatic) + 2 (NH2) = 4? But wait, the problem says \"the number of all hydrogen atoms in the substance F\". Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me count again.\n\nStructure of F: 2,4,6-trinitroaniline.\n\nThe formula is C6H3N3O6NH2? Wait, no. Let me write the molecular formula properly. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Each carbon has:\n\n- Position 1: NH2 group.\n\n- Positions 2,4,6: NO2 groups.\n\n- Positions 3 and 5: each has a hydrogen.\n\nSo the ring has 6 carbons. Each carbon with a substituent: 1,2,4,6. The remaining positions 3 and 5 are CH groups. Therefore, the ring has two CH groups (positions 3 and 5), each contributing one hydrogen. Then the NH2 group has two hydrogens. So total hydrogens: 2 (from ring) + 2 (from NH2) = 4. But wait, the answer options are 7,5,3,10. 4 is not among them. Hmm. That suggests I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe my assumption about the structure of F is incorrect. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration of E adds only one nitro group instead of three? Wait, the reaction is E + x HNO3 → F. The problem says x is not given. So maybe only one nitro group is added. Let me reconsider.\n\nIf E is 2,4-dinitroaniline, and nitration adds one nitro group. Where would it go? Let's consider the directing effects again. The NH2 is at position 1, directing ortho/para. The existing nitro groups are at 2 and 4. Let's say the nitro is added to position 6 (ortho to NH2). Then the structure would be NH2 at 1, NO2 at 2,4,6. That's the same as before, leading to 4 H's. Which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added to another position. Let's think again. Suppose E is 2,4-dinitroaniline. The NH2 is at 1, NO2 at 2 and 4. The possible positions for nitration would be directed by NH2 (ortho/para) and the existing nitro groups (which are meta directors). Let me consider:\n\nThe NH2 at 1 directs to ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4). But position 4 already has a nitro. So possible positions are 2 and 6. However, position 2 already has a nitro. So only position 6 is available. Therefore, adding a nitro at 6, leading to 2,4,6-trinitroaniline. Which again gives 4 H's. Not matching the answer options. So perhaps my assumption about the structure of E is wrong.\n\nLet me backtrack. Maybe the structure of C is different. Suppose that C is 1-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzene. That is, the two nitro groups are in the meta positions relative to Cl. Then, when reacting with aniline (D), the Cl is replaced by NH2. So E would be 3,5-dinitroaniline. Then, nitration of E would add nitro groups. Let's consider that. E is 3,5-dinitroaniline. The structure would have NH2 at position 1, NO2 at 3 and 5. Now, directing effects for nitration. The NH2 is at 1, directing ortho/para (positions 2,4,6). The existing nitro groups at 3 and 5 are meta directors. Let's see. The possible positions for nitration. The NH2 would suggest ortho/para to itself. Let's consider possible positions:\n\nOrtho to NH2 (position 1) are 2 and 6.\n\nPara to NH2 is 4.\n\nBut existing nitro groups are at 3 and 5. Let's check if these positions are available. Position 2: adjacent to nitro at 3? Position 2 is between 1 and 3. Since there's a nitro at 3, position 2 is ortho to nitro. The nitro is a meta director, so would it direct the nitro to meta positions? This is getting complex. Let me try to determine where the nitro would go. If we nitrate 3,5-dinitroaniline, the NH2 is a strong activator and ortho/para director. The nitro groups at 3 and 5 are deactivators and meta directors. The possible positions are ortho/para to NH2. Let's see:\n\nPosition 2: ortho to NH2. The existing substituent at position 3 is a nitro, which is a meta director. So adding a nitro at position 2 would be ortho to NH2 and para to the nitro at 3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitro adds to position 4 (para to NH2). Position 4 is between 3 (NO2) and 5 (NO2). Adding a nitro there. Let me think about the directing effects. The NH2 would want to direct to position 4 (para). The existing nitro groups at 3 and 5 would want to direct meta to themselves. For example, the nitro at 3 would direct to positions 1 and 5 (meta). But position 1 has NH2. The nitro at 5 would direct to positions 1 and 3. So maybe position 4 is a possible site. Adding a nitro at position 4 would give a molecule with NH2 at 1, NO2 at 3,4,5. Let's check symmetry. If the molecule has substituents at 1 (NH2), 3,4,5 (NO2), then the remaining positions are 2 and 6. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6. Are they equivalent? Due to symmetry? If the nitro groups are at 3,4,5, then positions 2 and 6 would be symmetric? Let me visualize:\n\nPositions:\n\n1: NH2\n\n3: NO2\n\n4: NO2\n\n5: NO2\n\nSo positions 2 and 6 are each adjacent to a nitro at 3 and 5. Wait, position 2 is adjacent to nitro at 3, and position 6 is adjacent to nitro at 5. But since there's a nitro at 4 as well, maybe the symmetry is such that positions 2 and 6 are equivalent. If so, then the aromatic protons would give one signal, and the NH2 protons another, totaling two signals. That fits the NMR data. Let's count the hydrogens in this structure. The aromatic ring has hydrogens at positions 2 and 6, each contributing one H. Plus the NH2 group has two H. Total H: 2 + 2 = 4. Still 4, which isn't among the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there are more hydrogens. Let me check the molecular structure again. If the molecule has substituents at 1 (NH2), 3,4,5 (NO2), then the ring has:\n\nPosition 1: NH2\n\nPosition 2: CH?\n\nPosition 3: NO2\n\nPosition 4: NO2\n\nPosition 5: NO2\n\nPosition 6: CH?\n\nSo positions 2 and 6 have CH groups. Each has one H. Then the NH2 has two H. Total H: 2 (aromatic) + 2 (NH2) = 4. Still 4. Not matching options. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the number of nitro groups added in the last step. Perhaps only one nitro is added to E, making F have fewer nitro groups? Let me consider.\n\nIf E is 3,5-dinitroaniline and only one nitro is added, say to position 2. Then the structure would have NH2 at 1, NO2 at 2,3,5. Let's see the NMR. The aromatic protons would be at positions 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Position 4 is between NO2 at 3 and 5. Position 6 is between NO2 at 5 and CH at 6? No, if position 6 has a CH. Wait, if there's a nitro at 2, then position 6 would be adjacent to nitro at 5. Position 4 would be adjacent to nitro at 3 and 5. Maybe positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. Then there would be two different aromatic protons, leading to two signals plus the NH2. But the problem states only two signals total. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E has a different structure. Let me go back to the earlier steps. Maybe my assumption about the structure of C is wrong. Let's try to figure out C again. Starting with A: chlorobenzene. Then two nitrations. Let me think of possible symmetrical structures. If the two nitro groups are in positions that are symmetric relative to the Cl, maybe leading to a structure where after substitution with aniline, E has symmetry that allows for further nitration to give F with only two signals.\n\nAnother possibility: if C is 1-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzene. Then substitution with aniline (D) would give 3,5-dinitroaniline. Then nitration adds one nitro to position 2, giving 2,3,5-trinitroaniline. The structure would have NH2 at 1, NO2 at 2,3,5. Let's check symmetry. The aromatic protons would be at positions 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Position 4 is adjacent to NO2 at 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to NO2 at 5 and CH at 6. Not symmetric. So two different aromatic protons, leading to two signals plus NH2. Total three signals, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the nitration adds two nitro groups to E. Let me try that. If E is 2,4-dinitroaniline, and we add two nitro groups, making it 2,4,5,6-tetranitroaniline? No, that seems too many. Alternatively, maybe only one nitro is added. I'm stuck here.\n\nLet me think differently. The NMR has two signals, one of which is exchangeable (NH). The other signal is aromatic protons. For there to be only one set of aromatic protons, the ring must have all aromatic hydrogens in equivalent positions. That usually happens when the substituents are symmetrically placed. For example, if there are three substituents in 1,3,5 positions (meta), then the ring might have equivalent hydrogens. Wait, no. If there are three substituents at 1,3,5, then the ring would have no hydrogens? Or maybe two hydrogens in positions 2 and 4, which are symmetric. For example, if the ring has substituents at 1,3,5, then positions 2 and 4 are equivalent. But if there are more substituents...\n\nWait, let's consider F having a structure where all aromatic hydrogens are equivalent. For example, if the ring has three substituents in 1,2,4 positions, making the remaining hydrogens at 3 and 5 equivalent. But earlier calculation gave 4 H's. Not matching options.\n\nWait, maybe F is a compound with no aromatic hydrogens? But then the NMR signal would be only from NH, but the problem says two signals. So there must be aromatic protons.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe F has a structure where the aromatic protons are all equivalent. For example, if there are three nitro groups and an amino group arranged such that all aromatic hydrogens are in equivalent positions. For example, if the substituents are at 1,2,4, and the hydrogens are at 3 and 5, which are equivalent. But as before, that gives two aromatic protons. Plus two NH protons. Total four.\n\nBut the answer options are 7,5,3,10. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hydrogens. Let me re-examine the molecular formula. Let's take F as 2,4,6-trinitroaniline. The molecular formula would be C6H2(NO2)3NH2. Let's break it down:\n\n- Benzene ring: 6 C.\n\n- Each nitro group: NO2.\n\n- Amino group: NH2.\n\nSo the formula is C6H2(NO2)3NH2. Let's count all hydrogens:\n\n- The ring has hydrogens: originally benzene has 6 H. But with substituents, some are replaced.\n\nIn 2,4,6-trinitroaniline, the substituents are at positions 1 (NH2), 2,4,6 (NO2). The remaining positions are 3 and 5. Each of these positions originally has a CH group in benzene. Since there are no substituents there, they remain as CH. Therefore, two CH groups, each contributing one H: total 2 H.\n\nThe NH2 group contributes 2 H.\n\nTotal H: 2 + 2 = 4. Still 4. Not matching options. So where is the error?\n\nWait, perhaps there are more hydrogens elsewhere. For example, in the nitro groups? No, nitro groups are -NO2, no H. The amino group is -NH2, two H. The ring has 2 H. Total 4. Maybe the problem is not about aromatic protons but all hydrogens, including aliphatic? But there are no aliphatic hydrogens in F. All hydrogens are aromatic or NH.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the structure of F. Let me think of another possibility. Suppose that during the nitration of E, only one nitro group is added, but in a position that makes all aromatic hydrogens equivalent. For example, if E is 4-nitroaniline, and adding a nitro to position 2 and 6? No, that would be similar to before.\n\nWait, let's think about the answer options. The possible answers are 7,5,3,10. If the correct answer is 5, maybe F has 5 hydrogens. How?\n\nLet me consider another approach. Let's try to write down the molecular formulas of each compound and track the hydrogen count.\n\nStarting with Benzene: C6H6.\n\nA: Chlorobenzene: C6H5Cl. Hydrogens: 5.\n\nB: Nitrobenzene: C6H5NO2. Hydrogens: 5 (since one H replaced by NO2).\n\nC: Chlorobenzene with two nitro groups. So C is C6H5-Cl with two NO2. Let's say C is C6H3Cl(NO2)2. Hydrogens: originally 5 in chlorobenzene, minus 2 H replaced by two NO2 groups? Wait, no. Each nitro group replaces one H. So starting from chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl), adding two nitro groups would replace two H's. So chlorobenzene has 5 H. After two nitrations, it would have 5 - 2 = 3 H. So C has 3 H.\n\nD: Aniline, C6H5NH2. Hydrogens: in benzene, 6 H. But one H replaced by NH2, so 5 H in the ring + 2 in NH2? Wait, no. The ring has 5 H, and the NH2 has 2 H. Total H: 5 + 2 = 7? Wait, no. The molecular formula of aniline is C6H5NH2, which is C6H7N. So total hydrogens: 7.\n\nE: C + D → E. The reaction is C (C6H3Cl(NO2)2) + D (C6H7N) → E in EtOH, heating, -HCl. This suggests a nucleophilic substitution where Cl is replaced by NH2. So E would be C6H3(NO2)2NH2. Let's count the hydrogens in E: originally, C had 3 H (from earlier), and D has 7 H. But in the reaction, one Cl is replaced by NH2. The number of hydrogens in E would be... Let's think about the molecular formula. If C is C6H3Cl(NO2)2, and we replace Cl with NH2, E becomes C6H3(NO2)2NH2. Let's calculate the hydrogens in E. The ring has 3 H (from C), plus the NH2 has 2 H. Total H: 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, no. Wait, the ring hydrogens might change. Let me think again. Chlorobenzene has 5 H. After two nitrations, each nitro replaces one H, so 5 - 2 = 3 H remaining on the ring. Then replacing Cl with NH2 would add two H (from NH2) but remove one Cl. The ring hydrogens remain 3. So total H in E: 3 (ring) + 2 (NH2) = 5. So E has 5 H.\n\nThen E + x HNO3 → F. Let's assume one nitro group is added. Then F would have molecular formula C6H3(NO2)3NH2. The hydrogens would be: originally E had 5 H. Adding one nitro replaces one H, so 5 - 1 = 4 H. Still 4. Not matching options.\n\nIf two nitro groups are added, replacing two H: 5 - 2 = 3 H. Still not matching.\n\nIf three nitro groups are added: 5 - 3 = 2 H. Plus NH2 has 2 H. Total 4. Still 4.\n\nHmm. This suggests that my assumption about the number of H in E is wrong. Let me recalculate the hydrogens in E.\n\nLet me write the molecular formula of E. E is obtained from C (C6H3Cl(NO2)2) and D (aniline, C6H7N). The reaction is a substitution: Cl is replaced by NH2. So the molecular formula of E would be C6H3(NO2)2NH2. Let's calculate the number of hydrogens.\n\nThe ring has 6 carbons. Each carbon has:\n\n- One of the carbons has an NH2 group.\n\n- Two nitro groups on other carbons.\n\n- The rest are CH groups.\n\nLet me count the number of H in the ring. Let's say the ring has substituents at positions 1 (NH2), 2 (NO2), 4 (NO2), and Cl was at position 1 initially but replaced. Wait, no. If C is 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, then E would be 2,4-dinitroaniline. The ring has substituents at 1 (NH2), 2 (NO2), 4 (NO2). The remaining positions are 3, 5, 6? Wait, benzene has 6 positions. Let me list them:\n\nPositions 1: NH2\n\nPosition 2: NO2\n\nPosition 3: ?\n\nPosition 4: NO2\n\nPosition 5: ?\n\nPosition 6: ?\n\nIf positions 1, 2, 4 are substituted, then positions 3, 5, 6 are unsubstituted. Each of these would have a CH group. So three CH groups, each with one H: 3 H. Plus the NH2 has 2 H. Total H: 3 + 2 = 5. Ah! Earlier I thought there were only 3 ring H, but actually, if the substituents are at 1, 2, 4, then positions 3, 5, 6 have H. Wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (NH2) and position 2 (NO2). So yes, three unsubstituted positions: 3, 5, 6. Each has a CH group, contributing 3 H. Plus NH2 has 2 H. Total 5 H. So E has 5 H. Then, when we add x nitro groups to E to form F, each nitro replaces one H. Let's say one nitro is added, then F would have 5 - 1 = 4 H. Still not matching. If two nitros are added, 5 - 2 = 3 H. If three nitros are added, 5 - 3 = 2 H. None of these are in the options. But the answer options are 7,5,3,10. Wait, maybe I'm missing some hydrogens. For example, if the nitration adds a nitro group but also adds some other groups? No, the reaction is with HNO3/H2SO4, which adds NO2.\n\nWait, maybe the nitration adds more than one group, but I'm miscalculating the hydrogen count. Let's take an example. Suppose F has two nitro groups added to E, making it 2,4,5-trinitroaniline. Let's count the H. E had 5 H. Adding two nitro groups: 5 - 2 = 3 H. Plus the NH2 has 2 H. Total H: 3 + 2 = 5? No, because the ring H is 3, and the NH2 is 2, total 5. But if the ring H is 3, and the NH2 is 2, total is 5. But the answer option B is 5. Wait, this could be it! If F has 5 hydrogens total, then the answer is B:5. Let me confirm.\n\nIf F has 5 H in total, then the NMR would have two signals: one from the aromatic protons (say, 3 H) and one from the NH2 (2 H). But wait, if the aromatic protons are in equivalent positions, then they would give one signal. For example, if F is 2,4,6-trinitroaniline, but earlier calculation said 4 H. But if it's a different structure...\n\nWait, let me think again. If E is 2,4-dinitroaniline (with 5 H: 3 ring H and 2 NH2 H), and we add one nitro group to position 6, making it 2,4,6-trinitroaniline. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (NH2), 2,4,6 (NO2). The remaining positions are 3 and 5, each with a CH group, contributing 2 H. Plus NH2 has 2 H. Total H: 2 + 2 = 4. Not 5. But if we add one nitro to position 5, making it 2,4,5-trinitroaniline. Then the substituents are at 1 (NH2), 2,4,5 (NO2). The remaining positions are 3 and 6. Position 3 is between NO2 at 2 and 4, and position 6 is between NO2 at 5 and NH2 at 1. Are these positions equivalent? Probably not, so two different aromatic protons, leading to two signals plus NH2. Total three signals, which doesn't fit. But if the nitro is added to position 3, making it 2,3,4-trinitroaniline. Then the substituents are at 1 (NH2), 2,3,4 (NO2). Remaining positions 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Probably not. This is getting too complicated.\n\nWait, let's go back. If E has 5 H total (3 ring H and 2 NH2 H), and F is formed by adding one nitro group, replacing one ring H. Then F has 5 - 1 = 4 H. But if the nitro is added in such a way that the remaining ring H are symmetric, giving one signal. For example, if the nitro is added to position 6 (as before), making the ring H at positions 3 and 5. These are symmetric? If the molecule has substituents at 1 (NH2), 2,4,6 (NO2), then positions 3 and 5 are symmetric? Yes, because the molecule is symmetric with respect to the axis through positions 1 and the center. So positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. Therefore, the two ring H are equivalent, giving one signal, and the NH2 gives another signal. Total two signals. This fits the NMR data. And the total number of H is 2 (ring) + 2 (NH2) = 4. But the answer options don't have 4. This suggests a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hydrogen count for E. Let me recalculate. E is 2,4-dinitroaniline. Let's write its structure. The molecule has a benzene ring with NH2 at position 1, NO2 at 2 and 4. The ring has 6 carbons. Let's count the hydrogens on the ring:\n\n- Position 1: NH2 (no H here)\n\n- Position 2: NO2 (no H)\n\n- Position 3: CH (1 H)\n\n- Position 4: NO2 (no H)\n\n- Position 5: CH (1 H)\n\n- Position 6: CH (1 H)\n\nWait, position 6 is between position 5 and 1. So position 6 has a CH group. So total ring H: positions 3,5,6: 3 H. Plus NH2: 2 H. Total H: 5. Yes, that's correct. Now, if we add one nitro group to position 6, replacing the H at position 6. Then the ring H are at positions 3 and 5: 2 H. Plus NH2: 2 H. Total H: 4. But the answer options don't have 4. However, if we add a nitro group to position 3 or 5, replacing one of those H, then the remaining H would be 2 (if one is replaced). But the symmetry would be broken, leading to two different aromatic protons. So this doesn't fit the NMR data.\n\nWait, but what if we add two nitro groups to E, making it 2,4,5,6-tetranitroaniline? No, that would replace two H, leading to 5 - 2 = 3 H. Let's see: if two nitro groups are added to positions 3 and 5, then the ring H would be at position 6. Plus NH2: 2 H. Total H: 1 + 2 = 3. If the molecule has symmetry, maybe the one H at position 6 is equivalent to itself, giving one signal, and the NH2 gives another. Total two signals. This fits the NMR data. And the total number of H is 3. Which is option C:3. But is this possible?\n\nLet me check the structure. E is 2,4-dinitroaniline. Adding two nitro groups to positions 3 and 5. Now, the substituents are at 1 (NH2), 2,3,4,5 (NO2). The remaining position is 6, which has a CH group. So one H. Plus NH2: 2 H. Total H: 3. And the NMR would have one signal from the single H at position 6? No, because a single H would give a singlet, but the problem says two signals. Wait, one signal from the aromatic H (position 6) and one from NH2. Yes, two signals. And one of them (NH2) disappears in D2O. So this fits. And the total number of H is 3. Which is option C:3. But how would the nitration add two nitro groups to positions 3 and 5?\n\nLet me think about the directing effects. E is 2,4-dinitroaniline (NH2 at 1, NO2 at 2 and 4). Adding nitro groups. The NH2 is a strong activator and ortho/para director. The existing nitro groups are deactivators and meta directors. First nitration: where would the nitro go? Let's say first nitro goes to position 6 (ortho to NH2). Then, the molecule has substituents at 1 (NH2), 2,4,6 (NO2). Now, for the second nitration, the existing substituents are NH2 (ortho/para director), and three nitro groups (meta directors). The possible positions for the next nitro would be directed by NH2 (ortho/para: positions 2,4,6 already have nitro; position 3 and 5). Let's see. Position 3 is ortho to NO2 at 2 and para to NO2 at 4. Position 5 is ortho to NO2 at 4 and para to NO2 at 6. Adding a nitro at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then the molecule has substituents at 1 (NH2), 2,3,4,6 (NO2). The remaining position is 5, which would have a CH group. But this doesn't give symmetry. Alternatively, adding nitro to both 3 and 5. If possible, but with two nitrations, it would depend on the reaction conditions. If the reaction adds two nitro groups, then F would have 3 H total. This matches option C:3. But is this plausible?\n\nGiven that the problem states that in the NMR of F, there are two signals, one disappearing in D2O, this scenario fits. So the number of H is 3. Therefore, the answer is C:3.\n\nBut let me verify once more. If F has one aromatic H at position 6 and two NH2 H, total 3 H. The aromatic H would give one signal, and the NH2 another. Yes. And the count is 3, which is option C. This seems to fit.\n</think>"}
