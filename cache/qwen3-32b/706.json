Let me try to understand what's going on here. The problem says that in Martian civilization, all logarithms without specified bases are base b, where b is some fixed number greater or equal to 2. A Martian student wrote down two equations:\n\nFirst equation: 3 log(√x log x) = 56\n\nSecond equation: log_{log x}(x) = 54\n\nAnd there's a single real solution x > 1, and we need to find b.\n\nAlright, so first, let me recall some logarithm properties. Since all logs are base b unless specified otherwise. The first equation has log(√x log x). Let me parse that. Is that log of (√x multiplied by log x)? Or is it log base something? Wait, the problem says \"logarithms whose bases are not specified are assumed to be base b\". So in the first equation, the log is base b. The argument is √x multiplied by log x. Wait, but log x here is also base b? Because the base isn't specified. Yes. So both logs here are base b. Similarly, the second equation is log base (log x) of x equals 54. So the base of that logarithm is log_b x, and the argument is x. So that's a different base.\n\nSo let me write down the equations properly with base b where necessary.\n\nFirst equation: 3 * log_b(√x * log_b x) = 56\n\nSecond equation: log_{log_b x}(x) = 54\n\nAnd we need to solve for x and find b such that there is a unique solution x > 1.\n\nOkay, so let me start by working on the first equation. Let me denote y = log_b x. Maybe substitution will help here. Because in the second equation, we have log_{log x}(x), which if log x is y, then maybe we can express that in terms of y.\n\nBut let me first work on the first equation. Let me expand log_b(√x * log_b x). Using logarithm properties, log_b(A * B) = log_b A + log_b B. So:\n\nlog_b(√x) + log_b(log_b x)\n\n√x is x^(1/2), so log_b(x^(1/2)) is (1/2) log_b x. And then log_b(log_b x) is just log_b(y) if y = log_b x. So putting it all together:\n\nFirst equation becomes 3 * [ (1/2) log_b x + log_b(log_b x) ] = 56.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n3*( (1/2)y + log_b y ) = 56.\n\nSo, 3*( (y/2) + log_b y ) = 56.\n\nSimilarly, let me look at the second equation: log_{log_b x}(x) = 54. So that is log_{y}(x) = 54. But x can be expressed in terms of y. Since y = log_b x, then x = b^y. Therefore, log_y (b^y) = 54. Let me check that.\n\nYes, log base y of x is log_y(b^y). Let me compute that. log_y(b^y) = y * log_y b. Because log_b(a^c) = c log_b a. Wait, but here the base is y. So log_y(b^y) = y * log_y b. And log_y b is 1 / log_b y by change of base formula. Therefore, log_y b = 1 / log_b y. Therefore, the entire expression is y * (1 / log_b y). And that equals 54.\n\nTherefore, the second equation gives us:\n\ny / log_b y = 54.\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\nEquation (1): 3*( (y/2) + log_b y ) = 56\n\nEquation (2): y / log_b y = 54\n\nSo now, we have two equations with two variables: y and b. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation (1): (3y)/2 + 3 log_b y = 56\n\nEquation (2): y / log_b y = 54\n\nSo perhaps we can solve Equation (2) for log_b y and substitute into Equation (1). Let me try that.\n\nFrom Equation (2):\n\nLet me denote z = log_b y. Then Equation (2) becomes y / z = 54 => y = 54 z.\n\nSo, z = log_b y => z = log_b (54 z). Let me write that:\n\nz = log_b (54 z)\n\nBut also, from Equation (1):\n\n(3y)/2 + 3 z = 56. But since y = 54 z, substitute that in:\n\n(3*(54 z))/2 + 3 z = 56 => (162 z)/2 + 3 z = 56 => 81 z + 3 z = 56 => 84 z = 56 => z = 56 / 84 = 2/3.\n\nSo z = 2/3. Therefore, from Equation (2), y = 54 z = 54*(2/3) = 36. Therefore, y = 36 and z = 2/3.\n\nSo now, we have z = log_b y = 2/3, and y = 36. Therefore:\n\nlog_b 36 = 2/3.\n\nWhich means that b^(2/3) = 36. Therefore, to solve for b, we can raise both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\nb = 36^(3/2).\n\nCompute 36^(1/2) is 6, so 36^(3/2) is 6^3 = 216. Therefore, b = 216.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Let me verify all steps again to make sure.\n\nStarting from equations:\n\nFirst equation: 3 log(√x log x) = 56. Converted to base b logs, expanded to 3*( (1/2)y + log_b y ) = 56. Then second equation converted to y / log_b y = 54. Then substitution with z = log_b y, leading to y = 54 z. Then substituted into equation 1 to find z = 2/3, y = 36. Then log_b 36 = 2/3, leading to b = 36^(3/2) = 216. Seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if x is indeed greater than 1 and if there are any constraints. Since x > 1, and since y = log_b x = 36, then x = b^36. Since b ≥ 2, x is definitely greater than 1. Also, in the second equation, log_{log x}(x) requires that the base log x is positive and not equal to 1. Since log x is y = 36, which is positive (since x > 1 and base b ≥ 2, so log_b x = 36 > 0) and 36 ≠ 1, so that's okay. Also, the argument x is positive, which it is. So all conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other possible solutions? The problem states that the system has a single real solution x > 1, so our solution should be unique. Let me check if our steps could have introduced extraneous solutions or missed something.\n\nFrom equation (2): y / log_b y = 54. When we set z = log_b y, then y = 54 z. Then z = log_b (54 z). But we also found z from equation (1). So we found z = 2/3. But is there another solution for z?\n\nSuppose there are multiple solutions for z? But in equation (1), after substitution, we directly solved for z and found z = 2/3. Since equation (1) after substitution became linear in z, so only one solution. Therefore, unique solution. Therefore, the system has a unique solution, as required. Therefore, b = 216 is correct.\n\nBut let me verify with actual numbers. Let me compute x and check both equations.\n\nGiven b = 216, y = log_b x = 36, so x = b^36 = 216^36. Let me check the second equation first: log_{log x}(x) = 54. log x is log_b x = 36, so log base 36 of x is log_36 (216^36). Which is 36 * log_36 (216). Let me compute log_36 (216). Since 36 is 6^2, 216 is 6^3. Therefore, log_{6^2} (6^3) = (3 / 2). Because log_{a^k} (a^m) = m / k. Therefore, 36 * (3/2) = 54. Which matches the second equation. Perfect.\n\nNow check the first equation: 3 log(√x log x) = 56. Let me compute log(√x log x) where log is base b = 216.\n\nFirst, √x is x^(1/2) = (216^36)^(1/2) = 216^18.\n\nlog x is log_b x = 36.\n\nTherefore, √x * log x = 216^18 * 36.\n\nSo log_b (216^18 * 36) = log_b (216^18) + log_b 36 = 18 * log_b 216 + log_b 36.\n\nBut log_b 216 is log_{216} 216 = 1. Therefore, first term is 18 * 1 = 18. Second term is log_{216} 36. Let me compute that.\n\nSince 216 = 6^3, 36 = 6^2. Therefore, log_{6^3}(6^2) = 2/3. Therefore, log_{216} 36 = 2/3.\n\nTherefore, log_b (√x log x) = 18 + 2/3 = 56/3. Then multiplying by 3 gives 56, which matches the first equation. Perfect. So both equations check out.\n\nTherefore, b is indeed 216. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{216}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{216}\n</think>"}
