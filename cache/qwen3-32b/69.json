Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: Ammonia is prepared by heating solid ammonium chloride. Hmm. I remember that ammonium chloride when heated undergoes sublimation, turning into gas and then solid again when it cools. But wait, does heating ammonium chloride just produce ammonia? Or does it react with something else? I think ammonium chloride decomposes into ammonia and hydrogen chloride gas when heated. So the reaction would be NH4Cl → NH3 + HCl. But in the lab, a common method for preparing ammonia is by heating ammonium salts with a base like calcium hydroxide. Like the reaction between ammonium chloride and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) to produce ammonia. If you just heat solid ammonium chloride, you might get a mixture of NH3 and HCl, which could recombine when they cool, leading to not much ammonia being collected. So maybe option A is not the right method. \n\nMoving to option B: Nitrogen dioxide is made by adding aluminum pieces to cold concentrated nitric acid. Wait, nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. When metals react with concentrated nitric acid, they usually don't produce hydrogen gas because the nitric acid gets reduced instead. For example, copper reacting with concentrated nitric acid produces NO2. But aluminum is a reactive metal. However, I think that concentrated nitric acid can passivate certain metals like aluminum by forming a protective oxide layer. So if you add aluminum to cold concentrated nitric acid, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed because the metal is passivated. Therefore, the method described in option B might not work. Instead, maybe you need to use a different acid or conditions. \n\nOption C: Hydrogen sulfide is prepared by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to solid sodium sulfide. Let me recall. Hydrogen sulfide gas is typically prepared in the lab by reacting a metal sulfide with a dilute acid, like HCl or dilute H2SO4. The reaction would be, for example, Na2S + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H2S↑. However, if you use concentrated sulfuric acid, which is a strong oxidizing agent, it might not just produce H2S. Instead, sulfuric acid could oxidize H2S to elemental sulfur or other products. The reaction between sodium sulfide and concentrated sulfuric acid might produce H2S, but then the H2S gets oxidized by the H2SO4. So this method might not be feasible because it could lead to side reactions. Therefore, using concentrated sulfuric acid is probably not the right approach. \n\nOption D: Oxygen is prepared by heating a mixture of potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide. Yes, I remember that potassium chlorate (KClO3) when heated decomposes to produce oxygen gas. The reaction is 2KClO3 → 2KCl + 3O2↑. But this reaction typically requires a catalyst like manganese dioxide (MnO2) to lower the decomposition temperature. So in the lab, KClO3 is often mixed with MnO2 and heated to produce oxygen. The MnO2 acts as a catalyst and doesn't get consumed. So this method is standard and correct. \n\nSo going back through the options: A is probably not correct because heating ammonium chloride alone doesn't effectively produce ammonia. B is incorrect because aluminum is passivated by concentrated nitric acid. C is incorrect because concentrated sulfuric acid would oxidize H2S. D is correct because heating KClO3 with MnO2 is a standard method for producing oxygen. Therefore, the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
