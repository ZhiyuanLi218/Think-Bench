The magnetic field has components B_x = B₀ cos(ωt), B_y = B₀ sin(ωt), and B_z is a constant much larger than B₀. At t=0, all protons are polarized along the z-axis. Resonance occurs when the frequency matches some natural frequency of the system, right?\n\nFirst, let me recall that the magnetic moment μ interacts with the magnetic field B through the Hamiltonian H = -μ·B. Since the magnetic field is time-dependent, the Hamiltonian will also be time-dependent. But maybe there's a way to simplify this by going into a rotating frame?\n\nThe magnetic field has a component rotating in the x-y plane with angular frequency ω, and a static component along z. Since B₀ is much smaller than B_z, maybe we can treat the rotating part as a perturbation? Or perhaps use the rotating wave approximation?\n\nLet me think about the equations of motion. The torque on the magnetic moment is given by dμ/dt = γ μ × B, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. Wait, actually, the equation of motion for the magnetic moment in a magnetic field is the Bloch equation, but maybe for a single proton, we can use the Larmor precession equation.\n\nYes, the magnetic moment precesses around the magnetic field with the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is given by ω_L = γ B, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But here, the magnetic field is time-dependent and rotating.\n\nLet me write down the components of the magnetic field again:\n\nB_x(t) = B₀ cos(ωt)\nB_y(t) = B₀ sin(ωt)\nB_z(t) = B_z (constant)\n\nSo the magnetic field is rotating in the x-y plane with angular frequency ω, and has a constant component along z. The total magnetic field is B(t) = B_rot(t) + B_z ẑ, where B_rot(t) is the rotating part.\n\nIf I consider the system in the rotating frame, which is rotating about the z-axis with angular frequency ω, then maybe the time dependence can be removed? In the rotating frame, the effective magnetic field would be static?\n\nYes, this is similar to the rotating frame used in NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance). Let me recall that when you have a rotating magnetic field, you can switch to a frame rotating at the same frequency to simplify the equations.\n\nIn the rotating frame, the effective magnetic field is given by B_eff = B - (ω / γ) ẑ. Wait, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nThe transformation to the rotating frame involves a rotation about the z-axis with angular velocity ω. The effective Hamiltonian in the rotating frame is H' = H - ω·J, where J is the angular momentum operator. For magnetic moments, the relation is similar. The Larmor precession frequency is ω_L = γ B, so if we have a frame rotating at frequency ω, the effective precession frequency is ω_L - ω.\n\nBut in this case, the magnetic field has a component rotating at ω. So in the rotating frame, the rotating component becomes static? Let me try to write the equations.\n\nIn the lab frame, the magnetic moment μ precesses around the total magnetic field B(t). But solving the equations of motion in the lab frame might be complicated because B(t) is time-dependent. However, in the rotating frame, the effective magnetic field might be static, which would make the problem easier.\n\nLet me recall the transformation. Suppose we rotate the coordinate system about the z-axis with angular velocity ω. Then, in this rotating frame, a vector that is rotating in the lab frame with angular velocity ω would appear stationary. For example, the rotating part of the magnetic field, B_rot(t), which is rotating with angular velocity ω, would appear as a static vector in the rotating frame.\n\nBut there's also the static B_z component. So in the rotating frame, the effective magnetic field would be the combination of the static B_z and the static B_rot, but adjusted by the rotation frequency ω. Wait, there's also a term from the rotating frame itself. When you switch to a rotating frame, there is an effective magnetic field due to the rotation.\n\nThe general formula for the effective magnetic field in the rotating frame is B_eff = B - (ω / γ) ẑ. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the Hamiltonian.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in the lab frame is H = -γ μ · B(t). In the rotating frame, the Hamiltonian is modified by the rotation. The transformation is a unitary transformation corresponding to rotation about z-axis with frequency ω. The transformed Hamiltonian H' can be found by H' = U H U† - iħ U ∂U/∂t, where U is the rotation operator.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way. In NMR, when you have a magnetic field rotating at frequency ω in the lab frame, and you switch to a frame rotating at ω, the effective field is given by B_eff = B_0 ẑ + B_rot - (ω / γ) ẑ. Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe Larmor frequency in the rotating frame is ω_L' = γ (B_z + B_rot_effective) - ω. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the effective field.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the rotating frame, the magnetic moment experiences an effective field which is the lab frame field minus the field corresponding to the rotation frequency. So, if the rotation frequency is ω, then the effective field is B_eff = B_lab - (ω / γ) ẑ.\n\nSo in our case, B_lab has components B_x = B₀ cos(ωt), B_y = B₀ sin(ωt), B_z = B_z. In the rotating frame, the effective field would be:\n\nB_eff,x = B_x(t) - (ω / γ) * something? Wait, no. Let me recall that the transformation to the rotating frame introduces an effective field due to the rotation. For example, in the rotating frame, the Hamiltonian becomes H' = -γ μ · (B_lab - B_rot_frame), where B_rot_frame is the field due to the rotation. Wait, I need to be precise.\n\nLet me use the rotating wave approximation approach. The idea is that if we go to a frame rotating about the z-axis with angular frequency ω, then the time dependence of the rotating field disappears. Let me denote the rotating frame coordinates as x', y', z', where the z' axis is the same as z, and x', y' rotate with angular velocity ω around z.\n\nIn this frame, the magnetic field components will be:\n\nThe rotating part B_rot(t) = B₀ [cos(ωt) x̂ + sin(ωt) ŷ] becomes static in the rotating frame. Let me see: at any time t, in the lab frame, this vector is at angle ωt from the x-axis. In the rotating frame, which is also rotating at ωt, this vector appears stationary along, say, the x'-axis. Therefore, in the rotating frame, B_rot is just B₀ x̂'.\n\nMeanwhile, the static B_z remains the same in the rotating frame because it's along the axis of rotation.\n\nHowever, there is also an effective magnetic field due to the rotation of the frame itself. When you rotate the frame, there is a fictitious magnetic field? Wait, no, it's more about the transformation of the equations of motion.\n\nThe equation of motion for the magnetic moment in the rotating frame can be derived by considering the transformation. Let me recall that in the rotating frame, the effective magnetic field is given by B_eff = B_lab - (ω / γ) ẑ. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the Larmor equation.\n\nThe equation of motion in the lab frame is:\n\ndμ/dt = γ μ × B_lab(t)\n\nIn the rotating frame, which is rotating with angular velocity Ω = ω ẑ, the equation of motion becomes:\n\ndμ'/dt = γ μ' × B_lab(t) - γ μ' × Ω\n\nWait, more accurately, the time derivative in the rotating frame includes a term due to the rotation of the frame. The general formula is:\n\ndμ/dt (lab) = dμ'/dt (rotating) + Ω × μ'\n\nSo substituting into the equation of motion:\n\ndμ'/dt + Ω × μ' = γ μ' × B_lab(t)\n\nTherefore,\n\ndμ'/dt = γ μ' × B_lab(t) - Ω × μ' = γ μ' × [B_lab(t) - (Ω / γ)]\n\nTherefore, in the rotating frame, the equation of motion is equivalent to precession around an effective magnetic field:\n\nB_eff(t) = B_lab(t) - (Ω / γ)\n\nIn our case, Ω = ω ẑ, so:\n\nB_eff(t) = B_lab(t) - (ω / γ) ẑ\n\nNow, substituting B_lab(t):\n\nB_lab(t) = B₀ [cos(ωt) x̂ + sin(ωt) ŷ] + B_z ẑ\n\nBut in the rotating frame, we need to express this in terms of the rotating frame coordinates. However, since we're subtracting (ω / γ) ẑ, which is along the same axis as B_z, maybe we can combine them.\n\nBut also, in the rotating frame, the rotating part of B_lab(t) becomes static. Let me think again. Since the rotating frame is rotating with angular frequency ω, the time dependence of the rotating component is removed. So, if B_lab(t) has components rotating at ω, then in the rotating frame, they become static. Therefore, B_rot(t) in the lab frame becomes a static vector in the rotating frame. Let me denote that static vector as B_rot = B₀ x̂'.\n\nTherefore, in the rotating frame, B_lab(t) expressed in rotating coordinates is B_rot + B_z ẑ. Therefore, substituting into B_eff(t):\n\nB_eff(t) = [B_rot + B_z ẑ] - (ω / γ) ẑ = B_rot + [B_z - (ω / γ)] ẑ\n\nSo the effective magnetic field in the rotating frame is a combination of a static transverse field B_rot (along x') and a static longitudinal field [B_z - (ω / γ)] along z.\n\nTherefore, the effective field is:\n\nB_eff = B₀ x̂' + [B_z - (ω / γ)] ẑ\n\nNow, for resonance to occur, we need the effective field to have a component that can cause transitions between energy levels. In the case where the effective longitudinal field [B_z - (ω / γ)] is zero, the effective magnetic field is purely transverse, leading to maximum absorption or transition probability. This is the condition for resonance.\n\nTherefore, setting [B_z - (ω / γ)] = 0, which gives:\n\nω = γ B_z\n\nBut wait, the Larmor frequency is ω_L = γ B_total, where B_total is the magnitude of the total magnetic field. However, in our case, the static field is B_z, so the Larmor frequency due to B_z alone is ω_0 = γ B_z. Therefore, resonance occurs when ω = ω_0.\n\nBut let me check again. The effective field in the rotating frame is B_eff = B₀ x̂' + [B_z - (ω / γ)] ẑ. If we set the longitudinal component to zero, then the effective field is purely transverse, which means that the magnetic moment can precess around the transverse field, leading to transitions between spin states. This is the condition for resonance in NMR, where the frequency of the oscillating field matches the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, resonance occurs when ω = γ B_z. Since ω_0 = γ B_z is the Larmor frequency due to the static field B_z, the resonance condition is ω = ω_0.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let's think about energy levels. The energy levels of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field are given by E = -μ·B. In the case of a static magnetic field B_z, the energy splitting is between spin-up and spin-down states. The transition frequency between these states is the Larmor frequency ω_0 = γ B_z. Therefore, if we apply an oscillating magnetic field at frequency ω, resonance occurs when ω matches ω_0, allowing transitions between the energy levels.\n\nTherefore, the resonance condition is ω = γ B_z. So the answer should be ω = γ B_z. But wait, the problem says \"a proton with magnetic moment μ\". The gyromagnetic ratio γ is related to the magnetic moment μ. For a proton, μ = γ ħ / 2, but maybe we need to express γ in terms of μ? Wait, the question doesn't give specific values, so perhaps we need to express ω in terms of the given quantities.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a proton with magnetic moment μ\". The magnetic moment μ of a proton is related to its spin angular momentum S by μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. However, in the expression for the Larmor frequency, ω_L = γ B. Therefore, if we can express γ in terms of μ, then we can write ω in terms of μ and B_z.\n\nBut the problem does not give us the relation between μ and γ. However, in standard notation, for a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment is μ = γ ħ / 2, but maybe in this problem, since they just say \"magnetic moment μ\", perhaps we can take γ = μ / (ħ / 2)? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nActually, the Larmor frequency is ω_L = γ B, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. The magnetic moment μ is related to γ by μ = γ S, where S is the spin angular momentum. For an electron, γ is different from μ, but for a proton, same thing. However, since the problem gives μ as the magnetic moment, and doesn't specify γ, but asks for ω in terms of given quantities, which are μ, B₀, B_z, and the condition B₀ << B_z. Wait, but the answer is supposed to be ω, so maybe we need to express ω in terms of B_z and other constants?\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention any specific constants like γ or ħ. Maybe the question expects the answer in terms of the Larmor frequency due to B_z. Since resonance occurs when ω equals the Larmor frequency caused by B_z, which is ω = γ B_z. But since the magnetic moment μ is given, perhaps we can relate γ to μ?\n\nLet me recall that for a particle with magnetic moment μ, the relation is μ = γ S / 2? Wait, no, for a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment is μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. Wait, actually, the magnetic moment operator is μ = γ S. Therefore, the expectation value of μ in the state with spin-up is μ = γ ⟨S⟩. For a proton, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is a known constant, but since the problem just says \"a proton with magnetic moment μ\", maybe we can take μ as the magnitude of the magnetic moment, so μ = |γ| S. But unless we know the spin, which for a proton is 1/2, but again, the problem doesn't specify.\n\nHowever, the problem is likely expecting an answer in terms of B_z and the Larmor frequency. Since the resonance condition is when the frequency of the rotating field matches the Larmor frequency due to the static field. Therefore, ω = γ B_z. However, since they mention the magnetic moment μ, perhaps there is a way to relate γ to μ?\n\nLet me think again. The energy levels in a magnetic field B are E = -μ·B. For a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field along z, the energy splitting is ΔE = 2 μ B_z. The transition frequency is given by ΔE = ħ ω, so ω = 2 μ B_z / ħ. But this would be if μ is the magnetic moment. Wait, but earlier we had ω_L = γ B_z. Therefore, equating these expressions:\n\nγ B_z = 2 μ B_z / ħ ⇒ γ = 2 μ / ħ\n\nBut this is only if the magnetic moment is μ = γ S, and for spin-1/2, S = ħ/2, so μ = γ (ħ/2) ⇒ γ = 2 μ / ħ. Therefore, substituting back, ω = γ B_z = 2 μ B_z / ħ. However, the problem does not mention ħ. Therefore, maybe in the context of the problem, they are using a different convention where μ and γ are related without ħ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is abstract and just wants the resonance condition in terms of the given magnetic field components. Since resonance occurs when ω equals the Larmor frequency due to B_z. Since the Larmor frequency is ω_L = γ B_z. However, since they mention the magnetic moment μ, maybe we need to express γ in terms of μ?\n\nBut without knowing the relation between μ and γ, perhaps the answer is simply ω = γ B_z, and since γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, which is a constant for a proton. However, the problem says \"a proton with magnetic moment μ\", so maybe they expect the answer in terms of μ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is set in a way that the resonance frequency is determined by the static field B_z, regardless of the rotating field's magnitude B₀. Since resonance occurs when the frequency matches the natural precession frequency, which is determined by B_z.\n\nIn standard NMR, the resonance condition is indeed when the frequency of the oscillating field matches the Larmor frequency ω_0 = γ B_0, where B_0 is the static magnetic field. Therefore, in this problem, since the static field is B_z, the resonance frequency should be ω = γ B_z.\n\nBut since the problem mentions the magnetic moment μ, and doesn't specify γ, perhaps there is an expectation to relate γ to μ? Let me check units. The gyromagnetic ratio γ has units of rad/(s·T). The magnetic moment μ has units of J/T (since μ·B has units of energy, J). Wait, no, magnetic moment has units of A·m². Since torque is μ × B, torque has units N·m = J, so μ must have units J/T = (N·m)/T. Since N = T·C·(m/s), so substituting, J/T = (T·C·m²/s)/T = C·m²/s. Which is equivalent to A·m², since A = C/s. Therefore, μ has units of A·m².\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio γ has units of rad/(s·T). Since frequency has units of 1/s. So if we want to relate γ to μ, we need to consider the relation between μ and γ. For a particle with spin S, μ = γ S. Therefore, γ = μ / S. But S has units of J·s (since angular momentum has units of J·s). Therefore, γ has units (A·m²) / (J·s). Let me check:\n\nA·m² / (J·s) = (C/s · m²) / (J·s) = C·m² / (J·s²). But J = N·m = (kg·m/s²)·m = kg·m²/s². Therefore, substituting:\n\nC·m² / ( (kg·m²/s²) · s² ) = C / kg. Which is not matching with the known units of γ (rad/(s·T)). Hmm, maybe this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without needing to relate γ to μ, and just recognize that resonance occurs when ω equals the Larmor frequency due to B_z, which is ω = γ B_z. Since the problem mentions the proton has magnetic moment μ, but doesn't give more information, perhaps we are to take γ as known, or maybe μ is given in terms of γ? However, since the answer is to be given in terms of the given quantities, which are B₀, B_z, and μ, but B₀ is much smaller than B_z and is part of the rotating field. However, the resonance frequency does not depend on B₀, as it's a perturbation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ω = γ B_z. However, since the problem mentions the magnetic moment μ, and if we are to express γ in terms of μ, we need more information. But since the problem is likely expecting a standard resonance condition, which is the Larmor frequency due to the static field, which is ω = γ B_z. Since the question is from a physics problem, and in NMR, the resonance frequency is the Larmor frequency, which is ω = γ B. Therefore, unless there's a trick here, the answer is ω equals γ times B_z.\n\nBut the problem says \"a proton with magnetic moment μ\". Maybe the question expects expressing the answer in terms of μ and B_z? For example, if we use the relation between μ and γ. For a proton, the magnetic moment is μ = γ ħ / 2 (for spin-1/2 particles). Therefore, γ = 2 μ / ħ. Then, the resonance frequency would be ω = γ B_z = 2 μ B_z / ħ. However, the problem does not mention Planck's constant ħ, so maybe this is not the expected answer. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that μ is equal to γ, which would be incorrect, but perhaps in some unit systems?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B(t). At t=0, all protons are polarized along z, meaning that the initial state is the spin-up state along z. The rotating magnetic field will cause transitions to the spin-down state if the frequency matches the energy difference between the two states divided by ħ.\n\nThe energy difference between spin-up and spin-down states in a magnetic field B_z is ΔE = 2 μ B_z. Therefore, the transition frequency is ω = ΔE / ħ = 2 μ B_z / ħ. This is similar to what I had before. Therefore, if this is the case, then ω = 2 μ B_z / ħ.\n\nBut again, the problem does not mention ħ. However, in quantum mechanics, the resonance condition is determined by ħ ω = ΔE. Therefore, if we are to write it in terms of μ and B_z, we need to include ħ. However, since the problem is likely from a physics course, and assuming that they expect knowledge of the Larmor frequency, which is ω_L = γ B_z, and for a proton, γ is known, but since the problem gives μ, maybe they want us to relate γ to μ.\n\nBut without knowing the relation between μ and γ, we can't proceed. Wait, for a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment is μ = γ S, where S is the spin angular momentum. For a proton, the spin is ħ/2, so μ = γ (ħ/2). Therefore, γ = 2 μ / ħ. Therefore, the Larmor frequency is ω_L = γ B_z = 2 μ B_z / ħ.\n\nTherefore, the resonance condition is ω = 2 μ B_z / ħ. However, the problem does not mention ħ. Maybe in the problem's context, they are using units where ħ = 1, or they consider μ already includes the factors? Or maybe the question assumes that μ·B_z is the energy splitting, so ΔE = 2 μ B_z, then ω = ΔE / ħ = 2 μ B_z / ħ. But again, without ħ, we can't write it.\n\nWait, the problem is from a classical perspective? No, because magnetic moments and resonance transitions are inherently quantum phenomena. However, sometimes in classical E&M, you can describe precession. The Larmor frequency is a classical concept as well. In classical E&M, a magnetic moment precesses around the magnetic field with frequency ω_L = γ B. Where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, which for a classical particle is γ = μ / L, where L is the angular momentum. For a quantum particle, the relation is similar but involves ħ.\n\nBut since the problem mentions \"resonance transition\", which is a quantum concept, implying that the system is undergoing transitions between energy levels when the frequency matches the energy difference. Therefore, quantum mechanics is needed. Therefore, the answer should be ω = γ B_z, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton. However, since the problem gives μ, the magnetic moment, and asks for ω in terms of the given quantities, we need to relate γ to μ.\n\nAssuming that the magnetic moment μ is related to the gyromagnetic ratio γ by μ = γ ħ / 2 (for a spin-1/2 particle), then γ = 2 μ / ħ. Therefore, ω = 2 μ B_z / ħ. But since the problem doesn't mention ħ, perhaps it's expected to leave it in terms of γ? But the problem says \"a proton with magnetic moment μ\", so maybe μ is given as a known quantity, and γ is known for a proton?\n\nWait, the gyromagnetic ratio γ for a proton is a known physical constant, approximately 2.675 × 10^8 rad/(s·T). However, the problem doesn't give numerical values, so it's likely expecting a symbolic answer. Given that the problem mentions the magnetic moment μ, and asks for ω in terms of the given quantities, which are μ, B₀, B_z. But B₀ is much smaller than B_z and is part of the rotating field. However, the resonance frequency is determined by B_z, not B₀.\n\nBut how to express γ in terms of μ? For a spin-1/2 particle, μ = γ S. For a proton, the spin S is ħ/2, so μ = γ (ħ/2) ⇒ γ = 2 μ / ħ. Therefore, substituting into ω = γ B_z gives ω = 2 μ B_z / ħ. However, since ħ is not mentioned in the problem, this suggests that maybe the problem expects an answer in terms of γ, which would be ω = γ B_z. But the problem says \"a proton with magnetic moment μ\", so maybe γ is considered as known in terms of μ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach using the rotating frame effective field. Earlier, we found that the effective field in the rotating frame is B_eff = B₀ x̂' + [B_z - (ω / γ)] ẑ. For resonance, we want the effective longitudinal field to be zero, so that the magnetic moment precesses around the transverse field, causing transitions. Therefore, setting [B_z - (ω / γ)] = 0 ⇒ ω = γ B_z. Therefore, regardless of μ, the resonance condition is ω = γ B_z. But since the problem mentions μ, but doesn't mention γ, perhaps we need to relate them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that μ is equal to γ? But that would be incorrect dimensionally. However, if we proceed formally, if we assume μ = γ, then ω = μ B_z. But this is not correct physically, but maybe in some unit system? For example, in natural units where ħ = 1, then γ = 2 μ. But again, without knowing the unit system, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, let's think again. In the equation of motion, we had that in the rotating frame, the effective field is B_eff = B₀ x̂' + [B_z - (ω / γ)] ẑ. The resonance occurs when the longitudinal component is zero, leading to maximum transverse field. Therefore, the resonance condition is ω = γ B_z. Therefore, if we can express γ in terms of μ, then we can write ω in terms of μ.\n\nAssuming that the magnetic moment is μ = γ I, where I is the spin angular momentum. For a proton, which is a spin-1/2 particle, I = ħ/2. Therefore, μ = γ (ħ/2) ⇒ γ = 2 μ / ħ. Therefore, ω = γ B_z = 2 μ B_z / ħ. Therefore, the resonance frequency is ω = (2 μ B_z)/ħ.\n\nHowever, since the problem does not mention ħ, this suggests that either the problem expects the answer in terms of γ, which would be ω = γ B_z, or there's some other consideration.\n\nWait, let me check standard NMR theory. In NMR, the resonance condition is indeed when the frequency of the RF field matches the Larmor frequency, which is ω₀ = γ B₀, where B₀ is the static magnetic field. Here, in our problem, the static field is B_z, so the Larmor frequency is ω₀ = γ B_z. Therefore, the resonance condition is ω = γ B_z. Since the problem gives a magnetic moment μ, but doesn't specify γ, perhaps the answer is simply ω = γ B_z, with γ being the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton. However, since the question is likely expecting an answer in terms of the given quantities, and μ is given, maybe there is a way to relate γ to μ?\n\nIf we consider that for a particle with magnetic moment μ, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is related by μ = γ I, where I is the spin angular momentum. For a proton, I = ħ/2, so μ = γ (ħ/2) ⇒ γ = 2μ/ħ. Therefore, ω = γ B_z = 2μ B_z / ħ. But since ħ is not given in the problem, this suggests that maybe the problem assumes ħ = 1 or some other convention. However, in standard physics problems, unless specified, we cannot assume ħ = 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is purely classical? In classical E&M, the magnetic moment precesses around the magnetic field with the Larmor frequency ω = γ B. Where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, defined as γ = μ / L, where L is the angular momentum. If we consider a classical magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B_z, then the precession frequency is ω = γ B_z. If γ is defined as μ / L, then we need to know L. However, without knowing the angular momentum, we cannot proceed.\n\nBut in the absence of specific information, and since the problem mentions \"resonance transition\", which is a quantum concept, I think the answer they are expecting is ω = γ B_z, with γ being the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton. Since the problem gives the magnetic moment μ, and assuming that γ is known in terms of μ, but without more information, we can't write it in terms of μ. Therefore, maybe the answer is simply ω equals the Larmor frequency due to B_z, which is ω = γ B_z. Since the question is about resonance transition, which occurs when the frequency matches the Larmor frequency.\n\nGiven that the problem is likely testing the understanding that resonance occurs when the oscillating field frequency matches the Larmor frequency of the static field, the answer should be ω = γ B_z. Since the problem mentions the proton's magnetic moment μ, but doesn't give a relation to γ, and since γ is a known constant for a proton, maybe the answer is simply ω = γ B_z, with γ being the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton.\n\nHowever, to express this in terms of μ, if required, we would need to know the relation between μ and γ. But since the problem doesn't provide that, I think the answer they expect is ω = γ B_z. However, in many textbooks, the Larmor frequency is written as ω = γ B, and since γ is a known constant for a proton, this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the magnetic moment μ is related to the spin by μ = γ S, and for a spin-1/2 particle, the magnitude of the spin is S = ħ/2, then γ = 2 μ / ħ. Therefore, ω = γ B_z = 2 μ B_z / ħ. But since the problem doesn't mention ħ, this is speculative.\n\nGiven that the problem is from a quantum mechanics or NMR context, and resonance frequency is ω = γ B_z, and since the question is asking for the value of ω, and the given quantities are B_z and the magnetic moment μ, but without ħ, I think the answer expected is ω = γ B_z. Since γ is a property of the proton and is related to its magnetic moment, but without further information, we can't express it purely in terms of μ.\n\nBut let me check once more. The problem says \"a proton with magnetic moment μ\". The gyromagnetic ratio γ for a proton is a known value, but it is not given here. However, in terms of the magnetic moment μ, for a spin-1/2 particle, the relation is μ = (γ ħ)/2, so γ = 2μ/ħ. Therefore, the resonance frequency is ω = γ B_z = 2μ B_z / ħ. But again, ħ is not given.\n\nGiven that the problem does not provide ħ or any other constants, and since in many physics problems involving magnetic moments and resonance frequencies, the answer is expected to be in terms of γ and B_z, I think that the answer is ω = γ B_z. Since γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton, and it's a known constant, even though it's not provided here.\n\nTherefore, the resonance transition occurs when the frequency ω matches the Larmor frequency due to the static magnetic field B_z, which is ω = γ B_z.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe resonance transition occurs at $\\omega = \\gamma B_z$, so the value of $\\omega$ is \\boxed{\\gamma B_z}.\n</think>"}
