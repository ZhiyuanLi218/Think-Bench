First, I need to understand what is being asked here. \n\nWe have an electron in a state |α⟩ that's proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think refers to the spin-1/2 system, like the eigenstates of S_z. \n\nThen, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator A. The matrix representation of A is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of this operator A.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given state. The state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. Since it's proportional, we need to normalize it first. Let me compute the normalization factor.\n\nLet me denote the state as |α⟩ = N[(1+i)|up⟩ + (2 - i)|down⟩], where N is the normalization constant. To find N, we need to compute the inner product ⟨α|α⟩ = 1.\n\nSo, ⟨α|α⟩ = |N|² [ |1+i|² + |2 - i|² ].\n\nCalculating |1+i|²: that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.\n\nCalculating |2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, ⟨α|α⟩ = |N|² (2 + 5) = 7 |N|² = 1 ⇒ |N|² = 1/7 ⇒ N = 1/√7. Since the state is given as proportional, the normalization constant is 1/√7. Therefore, the normalized state is:\n\n|α⟩ = [ (1+i)/√7 ] |up⟩ + [ (2 - i)/√7 ] |down⟩.\n\nOkay, so that's the normalized state. Now, the next part is about the operator A. The matrix representation of A is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Let me think about what this matrix looks like.\n\nAssuming that the basis is the same as |up⟩ and |down⟩, which are the eigenstates of S_z. So, in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, the matrix A would be:\n\nA = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ].\n\nBecause for i ≠ j, which are the off-diagonal elements, they are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are 0. This matrix looks familiar—it's similar to the Pauli matrix σ_x multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and they have factors of 2 for the spin-1/2 systems. For example, the spin operator S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x. \n\nSo, if A is [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0], then that is indeed (ħ/2) σ_x. Therefore, operator A is proportional to the x-component of the spin operator. Therefore, the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of S_x, which are |→⟩ and |←⟩, or right and left spin states along the x-axis. \n\nTherefore, to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A, we need to express the state |α⟩ in terms of the eigenbasis of A, which is the S_x eigenbasis. Then, the probabilities would be the squared magnitudes of the projections of |α⟩ onto each eigenstate of A.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the matrix of A, we can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then compute the probabilities accordingly. Let me try both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_x are:\n\n|+x⟩ = 1/√2 [ |up⟩ + |down⟩ ]\n\n|−x⟩ = 1/√2 [ |up⟩ - |down⟩ ]\n\nBut wait, let me verify. The eigenstates of σ_x are [1;1] and [1;-1], normalized by 1/√2. Therefore, yes, for S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenstates would be those.\n\nTherefore, if A is (ħ/2) σ_x, then the eigenstates of A are the same as those of S_x. Therefore, the eigenstates of A are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩ with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. \n\nTherefore, the probabilities of measuring A as +ħ/2 or -ħ/2 would be the probabilities of the state |α⟩ being in |+x⟩ or |−x⟩.\n\nTherefore, to compute these probabilities, we need to compute the inner products ⟨+x|α⟩ and ⟨−x|α⟩, then take their squared magnitudes.\n\nLet me compute that. First, let's write |α⟩ in terms of |up⟩ and |down⟩:\n\n|α⟩ = [ (1+i)/√7 ] |up⟩ + [ (2 - i)/√7 ] |down⟩.\n\nNow, let me write |+x⟩ = 1/√2 (|up⟩ + |down⟩), and |−x⟩ = 1/√2 (|up⟩ - |down⟩).\n\nTherefore, ⟨+x|α⟩ = 1/√2 [ ⟨up| + ⟨down| ] |α⟩ = 1/√2 [ (1+i)/√7 + (2 - i)/√7 ] = 1/√2 [ (1 + i + 2 - i)/√7 ] = 1/√2 [ 3 / √7 ] = 3 / (√2 * √7) = 3 / √14.\n\nSimilarly, ⟨−x|α⟩ = 1/√2 [ ⟨up| - ⟨down| ] |α⟩ = 1/√2 [ (1+i)/√7 - (2 - i)/√7 ] = 1/√2 [ (1 + i - 2 + i)/√7 ] = 1/√2 [ (-1 + 2i)/√7 ] = (-1 + 2i)/√14.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |⟨+x|α⟩|² = (3/√14)^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.\n\nThe probability of measuring -ħ/2 is |⟨−x|α⟩|² = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.\n\nSo approximately 0.64 and 0.36. Let me check the answer options. The options given are:\n\nA: 0.61, 0.29 and 2ħ / sqrt(7)\n\nB: 0.54, 0.46 and 3ħ / sqrt(7)\n\nC: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ / 7\n\nD: 0.28, 0.72 and ħ / sqrt(7)\n\nSo, the probabilities I found are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which corresponds to option C. However, let me check the average value as well, to confirm.\n\nThe average value ⟨A⟩ is the expectation value of operator A in state |α⟩. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and σ_x expectation value in state |α⟩ can be calculated. Alternatively, since we have the probabilities of each eigenvalue, we can compute ⟨A⟩ = (+ħ/2)(9/14) + (-ħ/2)(5/14) = (9/14 - 5/14)(ħ/2) = (4/14)(ħ/2) = (2/14)ħ = ħ/7. \n\nTherefore, the average value is ħ/7. Which is option C. So option C says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average ħ/7. Therefore, answer is C. \n\nBut let me verify my calculation again to be sure. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nFirst, ⟨+x|α⟩:\n\n(1+i)/√7 + (2 - i)/√7 = [1 + i + 2 - i]/√7 = 3/√7. Then multiplied by 1/√2, so 3/√14. Squared magnitude is 9/14 ≈ 0.6428... which is approximately 0.64. Similarly, the other probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.357 ≈ 0.36. So yes, that's correct.\n\nFor the expectation value, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and the expectation value of σ_x in state |α⟩ would be ⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨α| σ_x |α⟩. Let me compute that directly as well.\n\nσ_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The state |α⟩ in vector form is [ (1+i)/√7 , (2 - i)/√7 ].\n\nTherefore, σ_x |α⟩ is [ (2 - i)/√7 , (1 + i)/√7 ].\n\nThen ⟨α| σ_x |α⟩ is [ (1 - i)/√7 , (2 + i)/√7 ] multiplied by [ (2 - i)/√7 , (1 + i)/√7 ]^T.\n\nSo compute (1 - i)(2 - i)/7 + (2 + i)(1 + i)/7.\n\nFirst term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) - i*2 + i^2 = 2 - i - 2i -1 = (2 -1) - 3i = 1 - 3i.\n\nSecond term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i^2 = 2 + 2i + i -1 = (2 -1) + 3i = 1 + 3i.\n\nAdding them: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2. Therefore, ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2/7. Therefore, ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * 2/7 = ħ/7. Correct. Therefore, the average value is ħ/7. \n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. \n\nBut let me check if there's any chance I made a mistake in identifying the operator A. The problem says that A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. In a 2x2 matrix, this is indeed:\n\n[ 0      ħ/2   ]\n\n[ ħ/2   0     ]\n\nWhich is exactly (ħ/2) σ_x. So that's correct. Therefore, eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, eigenvectors are the same as σ_x. Therefore, my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
