Let me start by writing down what I know.\n\nFirst, three pencils and one jumbo eraser cost $1.24. Then, five pencils and one jumbo eraser cost $1.82. Both prices don't include tax. The question wants the cost of a pencil in cents. Alright, so maybe I can set up some equations here.\n\nLet me denote the cost of one pencil as \"p\" dollars and the cost of one jumbo eraser as \"e\" dollars. Then, according to the problem:\n\nFor the first scenario: 3 pencils + 1 eraser = $1.24. So that would be:\n\n3p + e = 1.24\n\nAnd the second scenario: 5 pencils + 1 eraser = $1.82. So:\n\n5p + e = 1.82\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables. I need to solve for p, the cost of a pencil. Maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate e? Let me try that.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(5p + e) - (3p + e) = 1.82 - 1.24\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n5p + e - 3p - e = (5p - 3p) + (e - e) = 2p + 0 = 2p\n\nAnd the right side:\n\n1.82 - 1.24. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1.82 minus 1.24. Let me subtract dollars and cents separately. 1 dollar minus 1 dollar is 0. Then 82 cents minus 24 cents. Wait, 82 - 24 is 58 cents. So total is 0.58 dollars. So:\n\n2p = 0.58\n\nTherefore, p = 0.58 / 2 = 0.29 dollars. So that would be 29 cents. Wait, but let me check if that makes sense.\n\nLet me verify by plugging back into the original equations. Let me first convert p to dollars. If p is 0.29 dollars, then let's find e from the first equation.\n\nFrom equation 1: 3p + e = 1.24. So:\n\n3*(0.29) + e = 1.24\n\nCalculating 3*0.29: 0.87\n\nSo 0.87 + e = 1.24 => e = 1.24 - 0.87 = 0.37 dollars, which is 37 cents.\n\nNow let me check the second equation: 5p + e = 5*(0.29) + 0.37 = 1.45 + 0.37 = 1.82 dollars. Which is correct, as given in the problem. So that seems to check out.\n\nTherefore, the cost of a pencil is 29 cents. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors here. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1) 3p + e = 1.24\n\n2) 5p + e = 1.82\n\nSubtract 1) from 2):\n\n(5p + e) - (3p + e) = 1.82 - 1.24\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n5p - 3p + e - e = 2p\n\nRight side:\n\n1.82 - 1.24. Let me do this subtraction again. 1.82 minus 1.24. If I think of it as 1.82 - 1.24, I can subtract 1.24 from 1.82. Let me convert them to cents to avoid decimal confusion. 1.82 dollars is 182 cents, 1.24 dollars is 124 cents. 182 - 124 = 58 cents, which is 0.58 dollars. So yes, 2p = 0.58, so p is 0.29. So 29 cents. Then e is 1.24 - 3*0.29. Let me recalculate that. 3*0.29 is 0.87. 1.24 - 0.87. Again, converting to cents: 124 cents - 87 cents = 37 cents. So e is 0.37. Then 5*0.29 is 1.45, plus 0.37 is 1.82. Perfect. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 29 cents. Wait, but the problem says \"in cents, what is the cost of a pencil?\" So maybe they want it written as 29? But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could solve the system of equations using substitution. Let me try that. From equation 1: e = 1.24 - 3p. Then substitute this into equation 2:\n\n5p + (1.24 - 3p) = 1.82\n\nSimplify:\n\n5p + 1.24 - 3p = 1.82\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(5p - 3p) + 1.24 = 1.82 => 2p + 1.24 = 1.82\n\nSubtract 1.24 from both sides:\n\n2p = 1.82 - 1.24 = 0.58 => p = 0.29. Same result. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, substitution or elimination, I get p = 0.29 dollars, which is 29 cents. So the answer is 29 cents. Therefore, in cents, the cost of a pencil is 29. So I think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check once more with actual numbers. If a pencil is 29 cents, then three pencils would be 87 cents. Adding the eraser, which is 37 cents, total is 87 + 37 = 124 cents, which is $1.24. Correct. Five pencils would be 5 * 29 = 145 cents. Adding the eraser, 145 + 37 = 182 cents, which is $1.82. Correct. So all numbers check out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29 cents. So in cents, it's 29. The problem says \"in cents, what is the cost of a pencil?\" So they probably want the numerical value with the unit being cents, so 29. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe cost of a pencil is \\boxed{29} cents.\n</think>"}
