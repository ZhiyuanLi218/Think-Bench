The rest mass energy of the muon is given as 106 MeV. Hmm, let me recall what I know about Cherenkov radiation.\n\nCherenkov radiation occurs when a charged particle passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. The condition for Cherenkov radiation is that the particle's speed $ v $ must be greater than the speed of light in the medium $ c/n $, where $ c $ is the speed of light in a vacuum and $ n $ is the refractive index of the medium. So the condition is $ v > c/n $, which can be rewritten as $ n > c/v $. Wait, actually, if $ v > c/n $, then rearranging gives $ n > c/v $. So the refractive index must be greater than $ c/v $.\n\nBut I need to find the range of possible $ n $. Since the muon is emitting Cherenkov radiation, the refractive index must satisfy $ n > c/v $. However, the refractive index of a medium can't be less than 1, because the speed of light in a medium is always less than or equal to $ c $, so $ n \\geq 1 $. But here, since the muon is moving faster than the speed of light in the medium, $ n $ must be such that $ c/n < v $. Therefore, the refractive index must be less than $ c/v_{min} $, wait no, actually if $ n > c/v $, then for a given $ v $, there's a lower bound on $ n $. But the muon's speed depends on its momentum and mass. So I need to calculate the muon's speed from its momentum and rest mass energy.\n\nGiven the rest mass energy $ m_{\\mu}c^2 = 106 $ MeV and the momentum $ p = 140 $ MeV/c. Let me recall the relativistic relation between energy, momentum, and mass. The total energy $ E $ of a particle is related to its momentum $ p $ and rest mass $ m $ by the equation:\n\n$ E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 $\n\nSo first, I can compute the total energy of the muon. Let me plug in the numbers:\n\n$ E^2 = (140 \\, \\text{MeV})^2 + (106 \\, \\text{MeV})^2 $\n\nWait, hold on, the units here. The momentum is given as 140 MeV/c, so when I multiply by c, it becomes 140 MeV. Therefore, $ pc = 140 $ MeV. Then the equation becomes:\n\n$ E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 = (140)^2 + (106)^2 $ MeV².\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst compute $ 140^2 $: 140*140 = 19600\n\nThen $ 106^2 $: 106*106. Let me compute 100² + 2*100*6 + 6² = 10000 + 1200 + 36 = 11236. So 106² is 11236.\n\nTherefore, total energy squared is 19600 + 11236 = 30836 MeV².\n\nTaking the square root, E = sqrt(30836) MeV. Let me compute sqrt(30836). Hmm, sqrt(30836). Let me see, 175² is 30625, because 170²=28900, 175²=30625. Then 176²=30976. Our value is 30836, which is between 175² and 176². Let me compute 175.5²? Well, 175.5² = (175 + 0.5)^2 = 175² + 2*175*0.5 + 0.5² = 30625 + 175 + 0.25 = 30800.25. Our value is 30836, which is 30836 - 30800.25 = 35.75 above 175.5². Let's approximate. Let me call E ≈ 175.5 + Δ. Let's use linear approximation.\n\nLet f(x) = x², f'(x) = 2x. We know that f(175.5) = 30800.25, and we want to find x such that f(x) = 30836. Let Δ = (30836 - 30800.25)/(2*175.5) ≈ 35.75 / 351 ≈ 0.1018. So E ≈ 175.5 + 0.1018 ≈ 175.6018 MeV. So approximately 175.6 MeV. Let me check with calculator steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exact value? Let me check with exact calculation:\n\nsqrt(30836). Let me check if 175.6² is 175.6*175.6. Let me compute 175*175 + 175*0.6*2 + 0.6² = 30625 + 210 + 0.36 = 30835.36. Oh wow, that's very close to 30836. So 175.6² = 30835.36, which is 0.64 less than 30836. So the square root is approximately 175.6 + 0.64/(2*175.6) ≈ 175.6 + 0.0018 ≈ 175.6018 MeV. So E ≈ 175.6 MeV.\n\nSo the total energy of the muon is approximately 175.6 MeV.\n\nNow, we can find the Lorentz factor gamma, which is E/(m c²). Since E = gamma m c². Therefore, gamma = E/(m c²) = 175.6 / 106 ≈ 1.6566. Let me compute that. 106 * 1.6 = 169.6, 106 * 1.65 = 106*(1.6 + 0.05) = 169.6 + 5.3 = 174.9. Then 175.6 - 174.9 = 0.7. So 1.65 + 0.7/106 ≈ 1.65 + 0.0066 ≈ 1.6566. So gamma ≈ 1.6566.\n\nThen, the beta factor, which is v/c. We can find beta from the relation between gamma and beta. The relation between gamma, beta, and the momentum is also given by:\n\n$ p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma \\beta m c $\n\nTherefore, beta can be found from:\n\nbeta = p c / (gamma m c²) ) = p / (gamma m c)\n\nWait, but since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, so beta = v/c = p c / E. Because:\n\np c / E = (gamma m v) c / (gamma m c²) ) = v / c = beta. Yes, that's right. So beta = p c / E.\n\nGiven that p is 140 MeV/c, so p c is 140 MeV. Then beta = (140 MeV) / (E). Since E is approximately 175.6 MeV. Therefore, beta ≈ 140 / 175.6 ≈ 0.797. Let me compute that division.\n\nDividing 140 by 175.6. Let me note that 175.6 * 0.8 = 140.48. Which is just slightly more than 140. So 0.8 - (0.48)/175.6 ≈ 0.8 - 0.0027 ≈ 0.7973. Therefore, beta ≈ 0.797. Therefore, the speed of the muon is approximately 0.797 c.\n\nTherefore, the condition for Cherenkov radiation is that the speed of the muon is greater than c/n. So:\n\nv > c/n => n > c/v => n > 1/beta.\n\nSince beta ≈ 0.797, then 1/beta ≈ 1.254. Therefore, the refractive index must be less than... Wait, no. Wait, if n > c/v, then since c/v = 1/beta, then n > 1/beta ≈ 1.254. Wait, but Cherenkov radiation occurs when the particle's speed is greater than the speed of light in the medium, so v > c/n => n > c/v. Therefore, the refractive index must be greater than c/v, which is 1/beta ≈ 1.254. However, the refractive index can't be less than 1, but since 1.254 is greater than 1, the possible range for n is n > 1.254. But wait, the question says \"determine the possible range for the refractive index n of the medium\". But refractive index can't be less than 1 in most materials? Wait, actually, in some materials, especially for certain frequencies or in plasmas, the refractive index can be less than 1, but typically for Cherenkov radiation, it's considered in materials with n > 1. But I think the standard condition is that n > 1, so that the phase velocity of light in the medium is less than c. But here, the calculation shows that n must be greater than approximately 1.254 for Cherenkov radiation to occur. Therefore, the possible range is n > 1.254. However, the problem says \"determine the possible range for the refractive index n of the medium\". But wait, maybe there's another constraint?\n\nWait, but the refractive index can't be arbitrarily large. Because if n is too large, then c/n would be very small, so the condition v > c/n would be easily satisfied. But since the muon has a fixed speed, for any n less than c/v, which is 1/beta, then the muon would be faster than c/n. Wait, no. Wait, the condition is n > c/v. So if n is greater than c/v, then the muon is moving faster than c/n. Therefore, for the muon to emit Cherenkov radiation, the refractive index must satisfy n > 1/beta ≈ 1.254. But since the refractive index can be any value above that lower bound, but in reality, materials have refractive indices up to maybe around 2 or 3 or so? But the problem is not asking for what materials exist, but rather the possible range for n given that Cherenkov radiation is observed. Therefore, if the muon is observed to emit Cherenkov radiation, then the refractive index must satisfy n > 1/beta. Therefore, the possible range is n > 1.254. But let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, total energy: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)² = (140)^2 + (106)^2 = 19600 + 11236 = 30836. Then E ≈ sqrt(30836) ≈ 175.6 MeV. Then beta = pc / E = 140 / 175.6 ≈ 0.797. Therefore, 1/beta ≈ 1.254. Therefore, n must be greater than approximately 1.254. Therefore, the possible range is n > 1.25. But wait, the problem says \"determine the possible range\", so maybe we need to write it more precisely, perhaps with exact expressions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute beta more accurately. Let me try to compute E more accurately. Since E² = 30836, which is 175.6² ≈ 30835.36 as I calculated earlier. The exact value is sqrt(30836). Let me compute the difference between 175.6² and 30836:\n\n175.6² = (175 + 0.6)^2 = 175² + 2*175*0.6 + 0.6² = 30625 + 210 + 0.36 = 30835.36\n\nTherefore, E² = 30836, so E = sqrt(30835.36 + 0.64) = sqrt(175.6² + 0.64). Using the Taylor expansion, sqrt(x² + Δ) ≈ x + Δ/(2x). Here, x = 175.6, Δ = 0.64. Therefore, E ≈ 175.6 + 0.64/(2*175.6) ≈ 175.6 + 0.64 / 351.2 ≈ 175.6 + 0.00182 ≈ 175.6018 MeV. Therefore, E ≈ 175.6018 MeV. Therefore, beta = 140 / 175.6018 ≈ Let me compute that division.\n\nLet me write it as 140 / 175.6018. Let me note that 175.6018 * 0.8 = 140.4814. Which is higher than 140. So the exact value is 0.8 - (0.4814)/175.6018 ≈ 0.8 - 0.00274 ≈ 0.79726. Therefore, beta ≈ 0.79726. Therefore, 1/beta ≈ 1 / 0.79726 ≈ let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute 1 / 0.79726. Let me note that 1 / 0.8 = 1.25. Since 0.79726 is slightly less than 0.8, 1 / 0.79726 will be slightly more than 1.25. Let me compute:\n\nLet me write 0.79726 = 0.8 - 0.00274. Let me use the approximation 1/(a - b) ≈ 1/a + b/a² for small b. So here, a = 0.8, b = 0.00274. Therefore:\n\n1/(0.8 - 0.00274) ≈ 1/0.8 + 0.00274 / (0.8)^2 = 1.25 + 0.00274 / 0.64 ≈ 1.25 + 0.00428 ≈ 1.25428. Therefore, 1/beta ≈ 1.2543. Therefore, the refractive index must be greater than approximately 1.254. Therefore, the possible range is n > 1.254. But since the problem might expect an exact expression, perhaps we need to derive it symbolically?\n\nLet me try to do that. Let's start again.\n\nGiven that the condition for Cherenkov radiation is v > c/n => n > c/v. Therefore, n > c/v. So we need to find v in terms of the given quantities.\n\nWe can find v from the relativistic equations. The total energy E is given by:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (m c²)²\n\nWe can write beta gamma m c² = p, since p = gamma m v = gamma beta m c. Therefore:\n\np = beta gamma m c => beta gamma = p/(m c)\n\nBut also, E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). Therefore, beta = p/(gamma m c) = p c/(E). Therefore, beta = pc / E, which is what I had before.\n\nTherefore, beta = pc / E. Then, 1/beta = E / (pc). Therefore, the condition n > 1/beta becomes n > E/(pc).\n\nGiven that E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Therefore:\n\nn > sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) / (pc) )\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nsqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) / (pc) ) = sqrt( 1 + (m c^2 / pc)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + (m c / p)^2 )\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nsqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) / (pc) ) = sqrt( [ (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ] / (pc)^2 ) ) = sqrt( 1 + (m c² / pc)^2 )\n\nYes, so that's sqrt(1 + (m c² / (p c))² ) = sqrt(1 + (m c / p )² )\n\nWait, m c² / (p c) is (m c)/p. Therefore, yes. Therefore, n > sqrt(1 + (m c / p )² )\n\nBut let me check the units. m c has units of (MeV/c²) * c = MeV/c, and p is in MeV/c. Therefore, m c / p is dimensionless, which is good.\n\nTherefore, substituting the given values:\n\nm c² = 106 MeV, so m c = (m c²)/c = 106 MeV / c. Wait, no. Wait, m c² is 106 MeV, so m c = (m c²)/c = 106 MeV / c. Therefore, m c / p = (106 MeV / c ) / (140 MeV / c ) = 106 / 140 ≈ 0.7571.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1 + (0.7571)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.573) ≈ sqrt(1.573) ≈ 1.254. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, the exact expression is n > sqrt(1 + (m c / p )² ). Therefore, substituting the numbers, we get n > sqrt(1 + (106 / 140)^2 ). Let me compute that more precisely.\n\nFirst compute 106 / 140. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 2: 53 / 70 ≈ 0.757142857...\n\nTherefore, (53/70)^2 = (53^2)/(70^2) = 2809 / 4900 ≈ 0.573265...\n\nAdding 1 gives 1.573265...\n\nTaking the square root of that: sqrt(1.573265). Let me calculate that. Let me note that 1.25² = 1.5625 and 1.26² = 1.5876. Our value is 1.573265, which is between 1.25² and 1.26².\n\nCompute 1.25² = 1.5625\n\nDifference between 1.573265 and 1.5625 is 0.010765.\n\nLet me use linear approximation. Let f(x) = sqrt(x). At x = 1.5625, f(x) = 1.25. The derivative f’(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(x)). So f’(1.5625) = 1/(2*1.25) = 1/2.5 = 0.4.\n\nTherefore, approximate sqrt(1.5625 + 0.010765) ≈ 1.25 + 0.4 * 0.010765 ≈ 1.25 + 0.0043 ≈ 1.2543. Which matches our prior result. Therefore, sqrt(1.573265) ≈ 1.2543. Therefore, the refractive index must be greater than approximately 1.254. However, since the problem gives us exact numbers, maybe we can write the exact expression?\n\nBut let me check if there is a better way to write it. Alternatively, since m c² = 106 MeV and p = 140 MeV/c, then m c / p = (m c²)/c / p = (106 MeV)/c / (140 MeV/c) ) = 106 / 140. So yes, as above. Therefore, the exact value is sqrt(1 + (106/140)^2 ). Let me compute that fraction squared:\n\n(106/140)^2 = (53/70)^2 ≈ 0.573265...\n\nBut perhaps we can write it as a fraction? Let me see:\n\nsqrt(1 + (106²)/(140²)) = sqrt( (140² + 106²)/140² ) ) = sqrt(140² + 106²)/140. Which is exactly what we had before. And sqrt(140² + 106²) is sqrt(30836) ≈ 175.6 MeV, as before. Therefore, n > 175.6 / 140 ≈ 1.254. Therefore, the exact value is sqrt( (140² + 106²) ) / 140. But since the problem is asking for the possible range, and given that the refractive index must be greater than this value. However, since refractive index can't be less than 1, but our lower bound is already higher than 1, the possible range is n > 1.254. However, maybe there is an upper bound?\n\nWait, no. The condition for Cherenkov radiation is that the particle's speed is greater than the speed of light in the medium. So for a given particle speed, any medium with n > c/v will satisfy the condition. Therefore, there is no upper bound on n; theoretically, n can be as large as possible, but in reality, materials have limited refractive indices. However, since the problem is theoretical, the possible range is n > 1.254. But the problem says \"determine the possible range for the refractive index n of the medium\". So perhaps they expect an exact expression or a decimal value?\n\nGiven that the problem provides numerical values, they probably expect a numerical answer. Let me compute sqrt(1 + (106/140)^2 ) more accurately. Let me compute 106/140 first. 106 divided by 140. Let me compute 106/140 = 0.757142857...\n\nSquaring that: 0.757142857^2. Let me compute 0.75^2 = 0.5625. Then, 0.7571^2. Let me compute (0.75 + 0.0071)^2 = 0.75² + 2*0.75*0.0071 + 0.0071² ≈ 0.5625 + 0.01065 + 0.00005 ≈ 0.5732. Therefore, 1 + 0.5732 = 1.5732. Then sqrt(1.5732). Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me note that 1.254^2 = ?\n\n1.25^2 = 1.5625\n\n1.254^2 = (1.25 + 0.004)^2 = 1.25^2 + 2*1.25*0.004 + 0.004^2 = 1.5625 + 0.01 + 0.000016 = 1.572516. Which is very close to 1.5732. The difference is 1.5732 - 1.572516 = 0.000684. To find how much more than 1.254 we need to go. Let me denote x = 1.254 + δ, such that x² = 1.5732. Then:\n\n(1.254 + δ)^2 ≈ 1.254² + 2*1.254*δ = 1.572516 + 2.508 δ = 1.5732. Therefore:\n\n2.508 δ ≈ 0.000684 => δ ≈ 0.000684 / 2.508 ≈ 0.0002727. Therefore, x ≈ 1.254 + 0.00027 ≈ 1.25427. Therefore, sqrt(1.5732) ≈ 1.2543. Therefore, n > 1.254. Given that the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, and considering significant figures. The given values are momentum 140 MeV/c and rest mass energy 106 MeV. Both have three significant figures. Therefore, our answer should also have three significant figures. Our approximate value is 1.254, which is four significant figures. Let me check the exact value again.\n\nOriginal numbers:\n\nm c² = 106 MeV (three significant figures)\n\np = 140 MeV/c (three significant figures)\n\nTherefore, the calculation for n_min is sqrt(1 + (106/140)^2 ). Let me compute 106/140. Let me do exact decimal division:\n\n106 ÷ 140. Since 140 goes into 106 0. times. Let me compute 106/140 = 0.757142857...\n\nSo, squaring that:\n\n0.757142857...². Let me compute more accurately. Let me take 0.757142857 as approximately 0.757142857.\n\nLet me compute 0.757142857 * 0.757142857:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.757142857 * 0.757142857.\n\nLet me note that 0.757142857 is equal to 53/70 ≈ 0.757142857. Therefore, (53/70)^2 = 2809 / 4900 ≈ 0.573265306...\n\nTherefore, 1 + 0.573265306 = 1.573265306...\n\nTaking the square root of that: sqrt(1.573265306). As above, approximately 1.2543. Therefore, with three significant figures, this is approximately 1.25. Wait, but 1.2543 is 1.25 when rounded to three significant figures? Wait, 1.2543 is 1.25 (three significant figures) if we consider that the fourth digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. Wait, no. Wait, three significant figures: 1.25 (the first three digits are 1, 2, 5). The fourth digit is 4, so we keep it as 1.25. However, if the value is 1.2543, then with three significant figures, it's 1.25. However, if the value is 1.254, which is 1.25 (three significant figures) or maybe 1.25? Wait, 1.25 is three significant figures. But if the exact value is approximately 1.254, then depending on the context, maybe we need to write it as 1.25 or 1.254? Since the given values have three significant figures, the answer should have three. Let me check the precision of our calculation.\n\nOriginal momentum is 140 MeV/c (three significant figures), rest mass energy is 106 MeV (three significant figures). Therefore, when we calculate 106/140, it's 0.757... with three significant figures, so 0.757. Then, squaring that gives 0.573. Adding 1 gives 1.573. Square root of 1.573 is approximately 1.254. So with three significant figures, 1.25. Wait, sqrt(1.573). Let me check with calculator-like precision. Let me use a better method. Let me use the Newton-Raphson method to compute sqrt(1.573).\n\nWe want to find x such that x² = 1.573. Let me start with an initial guess of 1.254, as before. Compute 1.254² = 1.572516. The difference is 1.573 - 1.572516 = 0.000484. Next iteration: x_{n+1} = x_n + (1.573 - x_n²)/(2x_n). So:\n\nx1 = 1.254 + (0.000484)/(2*1.254) ≈ 1.254 + 0.000484 / 2.508 ≈ 1.254 + 0.000193 ≈ 1.254193. Then compute x1²: (1.254193)^2 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 1.254^2 + 2*1.254*0.000193 + (0.000193)^2 ≈ 1.572516 + 0.000483 + 0.000000037 ≈ 1.572516 + 0.000483 ≈ 1.573, which matches. Therefore, sqrt(1.573) ≈ 1.25419. Therefore, with more precision, approximately 1.2542. Therefore, with three significant figures, this is 1.25. Wait, no. Wait, 1.2542 has four significant figures. Three significant figures would be 1.25 because the first three digits are 1, 2, 5, and the next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. Therefore, 1.25. But wait, if the actual value is approximately 1.254, which is 1.25 when rounded to three significant figures? Wait, no. Wait, 1.254 is four significant figures. If we want three significant figures, we look at the first three digits: 1, 2, 5. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we leave the third digit as is. Therefore, 1.25. However, if the value was 1.255, then it would round to 1.26 with three significant figures. Therefore, our value of approximately 1.254 rounds to 1.25 with three significant figures. However, this seems like a loss of precision. But given that the original numbers have three significant figures, we can't have more in our answer. Therefore, the refractive index must be greater than approximately 1.25. However, if we carry out the exact calculation with the given numbers, we can write the precise value.\n\nBut let me check if there is a better way. Let me compute using exact fractions. Given that:\n\nn_min = sqrt(1 + (m c / p )² ) = sqrt(1 + (106 / 140 )² ) = sqrt(1 + (53/70)^2 ) = sqrt( (70² + 53²)/70² ) ) = sqrt( (4900 + 2809)/4900 ) = sqrt(7709 / 4900 ) = sqrt(7709)/70.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(7709). Let me see, 87² = 7569, 88² = 7744. Therefore, sqrt(7709) is between 87 and 88. 87.8² = ?\n\nCompute 87.8²: 87² + 2*87*0.8 + 0.8² = 7569 + 139.2 + 0.64 = 7569 + 139.84 = 7708.84. Wow, very close to 7709. Therefore, sqrt(7709) ≈ 87.8 + (7709 - 7708.84)/(2*87.8) ≈ 87.8 + 0.16 / 175.6 ≈ 87.8 + 0.0009 ≈ 87.8009. Therefore, sqrt(7709) ≈ 87.8009. Therefore, n_min ≈ 87.8009 / 70 ≈ 1.254298. Therefore, approximately 1.2543. Therefore, with the exact calculation, it's approximately 1.2543. Given that the original values have three significant figures, but since 1.2543 is very close to 1.254, which is three decimal places but with four significant figures. However, since the input data has three significant figures, we need to consider the precision. Let me think about error propagation.\n\nLet me assume that the given values are precise. The problem says \"a momentum of 140 MeV/c\" and \"rest mass energy of the muon is given as 106 MeV\". If these are exact values (for example, in a problem context where they are given as precise numbers), then we can treat them as exact and compute the exact value. However, in reality, the muon mass is known more precisely, but since the problem gives us 106 MeV, we take that as exact. Similarly, the momentum is given as 140 MeV/c. Therefore, in the context of the problem, we can treat them as exact and compute the precise value of n_min = sqrt( (140² + 106² ) ) / 140 ≈ 175.6 / 140 ≈ 1.254. Therefore, the answer is n > 1.25. However, to match the precision, if we take three significant figures, 1.25, but since our calculation gives 1.254, which is 1.25 when rounded to three significant figures. However, maybe the problem expects more precise answer? Let me check with exact fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact fractional expression? But probably not. Given that in particle physics, such calculations are often done with decimal precision. Given that in the calculation, we have n_min ≈ 1.254. So maybe the answer is n > 1.25. But to check, let me see if there's a standard way to present this. Alternatively, maybe I should present it as n > 1.25, but given that the exact value is approximately 1.254, which is 1.25 with three significant figures. However, if the problem expects an exact value, maybe they want it written as sqrt( (140^2 + 106^2 ) ) / 140, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, simplifying the numbers:\n\nGiven that 140 and 106 can be divided by 2: 140/2 = 70, 106/2 = 53. So we have sqrt(70² + 53²)/70. Which is sqrt(70² + 53²)/70. But unless there is some further simplification, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact fraction? For example, sqrt(7709)/70 ≈ 87.8 / 70 ≈ 1.254. However, since 7709 is a prime? Not sure. Anyway, given that, in conclusion, the refractive index must be greater than approximately 1.25. However, since the exact value is approximately 1.254, and given that in exams or problems, sometimes they expect you to keep more decimals, maybe we can write it as 1.25. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me use exact relativistic equations. Let me recall that for a particle with momentum p and rest mass m, the beta is given by beta = pc / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). Wait, no:\n\nEarlier, we had beta = pc / E, and E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). Therefore, beta = pc / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). Therefore, beta = 1 / sqrt( 1 + (mc²/(pc))² ). Therefore, 1/beta = sqrt( 1 + (mc²/(pc))² ). Wait, no:\n\nWait, beta = pc / E => 1/beta = E/(pc). And E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), so 1/beta = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) / (pc) ) = sqrt(1 + (mc²/(pc))² ). Therefore, yes, same as before. Therefore, n > sqrt(1 + (mc²/(pc))² ). Therefore, substituting numbers:\n\nmc² = 106 MeV, pc = 140 MeV. Therefore:\n\nsqrt(1 + (106 / 140 )² ) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.573) ≈ sqrt(1.573) ≈ 1.254. Therefore, n > 1.254.\n\nSince the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, and given that the numbers are in three significant figures, but our calculation gives us 1.254, which is three decimal places. However, if we consider that 106 and 140 are exact, then we can present it as 1.25. However, in most cases, such problems expect you to carry out the calculation with the given numbers and present the answer with appropriate decimal places. Since both given values are integers, but with three significant figures, and the answer comes out to approximately 1.25, but more accurately 1.254. Depending on the context, maybe present it as 1.25 or 1.254. Let me check with exact calculation using more precise decimals.\n\nGiven that 106/140 = 0.757142857...\n\nSquare is 0.573265306...\n\nAdd 1: 1.573265306...\n\nSquare root: Let me use a calculator here. Wait, since I don't have a calculator, but earlier we approximated it as 1.2543. If I take that value, then with three significant figures, it's 1.25. However, if the problem allows for more decimals, maybe present as 1.25. But let me think if there is any chance that the answer is supposed to be 1.25. For example, if I compute with approximate beta as 0.8, then 1/beta is 1.25. However, our exact calculation shows that beta is 0.797, leading to 1/beta ≈ 1.254. Therefore, if we use beta ≈ 0.8, we get n > 1.25, but with more precise calculation, it's 1.254. Given that, if the problem expects an exact answer, maybe they want us to write it as 1.25, considering that 140 MeV/c is close to the total energy of the muon, which was 175.6 MeV. However, I need to check if there is any miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me verify once again:\n\nTotal energy E = sqrt( (140)^2 + (106)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(19600 + 11236) = sqrt(30836) ≈ 175.6 MeV. Then beta = pc / E = 140 / 175.6 ≈ 0.797. Therefore, 1/beta ≈ 1.254. Therefore, n must be greater than 1.254. Therefore, the possible range is n > 1.25. But if we are to write it with three significant figures, 1.25. However, if we are to write it with more decimals, 1.25. But since 1.25 is three significant figures, and the exact value is approximately 1.254, which is 1.25 when rounded to three significant figures. However, in some cases, problems expect you to keep more decimals if the calculation suggests so. For example, if the given values are precise, then you can write more decimals. Since the problem didn't specify, but in physics problems, usually, you match the decimal places with the given values. Given that the momentum and rest mass are given as whole numbers, but they could have more decimals in reality, but here they are given as 140 and 106, which are three significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be given with three significant figures. Therefore, 1.25.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose I calculate using more precise fractions. Let me take E = sqrt(30836). Let me note that 175.6² = 30835.36 as before. The exact value of E is sqrt(30836). Let me compute the difference between 30836 and 30835.36: it's 0.64. Therefore, E = 175.6 + 0.64/(2*175.6) ≈ 175.6 + 0.00182 ≈ 175.6018 MeV. Therefore, beta = 140 / 175.6018 ≈ Let me compute this division more accurately. Let me write it as:\n\nLet me denote E = 175.6018 MeV.\n\nbeta = 140 / 175.6018 ≈ Let me perform the division step by step.\n\nFirst, note that 175.6018 × 0.8 = 140.48144 MeV.\n\nBut we have 140 MeV, which is 0.48144 MeV less than 140.48144 MeV. Therefore, beta = 0.8 - (0.48144 / 175.6018). Let me compute 0.48144 / 175.6018 ≈ 0.48144 / 175.6 ≈ Let me approximate 0.48144 / 175.6 ≈ 0.002742. Therefore, beta ≈ 0.8 - 0.002742 ≈ 0.797258. Therefore, beta ≈ 0.79726. Therefore, 1/beta ≈ 1 / 0.79726 ≈ Let me compute this using the Newton-Raphson method for reciprocal.\n\nLet me take an initial guess of x₀ = 1.254 (since 1/0.797 ≈ 1.254). Let me compute f(x) = 1/x - 0.79726. We want to find x such that 1/x = 0.79726, i.e., f(x) = 0.\n\nUsing Newton-Raphson:\n\nx_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f’(x_n)\n\nHere, f(x) = 1/x - 0.79726\n\nf’(x) = -1/x²\n\nStarting with x₀ = 1.254:\n\nf(x₀) = 1/1.254 - 0.79726 ≈ 0.79726 - 0.79726 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, if x₀ is chosen such that 1/x₀ ≈ 0.79726, then f(x₀) = 0. But we need to compute it properly. Wait, no. Wait, we want to solve 1/x = 0.79726 => x = 1/0.79726 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 1 / 0.79726. Let me use the Newton-Raphson method to solve for x where f(x) = x - 1/0.79726 = 0? No, better to define f(x) = 1/x - 0.79726 = 0.\n\nLet me take x₀ = 1.254 as initial guess.\n\nCompute f(x₀) = 1/1.254 - 0.79726 ≈ Let me compute 1/1.254:\n\n1 / 1.254 ≈ 0.79726 (since we know that beta ≈ 0.79726 and 1/beta ≈ 1.254). Wait, this seems circular. Let me instead compute 1/1.254 numerically.\n\nCompute 1 / 1.254:\n\nWell, 1 / 1.25 = 0.8\n\nSince 1.254 is larger than 1.25, 1/1.254 is less than 0.8. Let me compute:\n\nLet me write 1.254 × 0.797 = ?\n\nWell, we know that 1.254 × beta ≈ 1. Therefore, beta ≈ 0.797. But this is going in circles. Let me instead use linear approximation. Let me denote x = 1.254 + δ, and find δ such that 1/x = 0.79726.\n\nBut this seems too tangled. Given that we already have beta ≈ 0.79726, then 1/beta ≈ 1 / 0.79726 ≈ 1.254. Therefore, the refractive index must be greater than approximately 1.254. Given that the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, and considering that in most cases, two decimal places are sufficient, I would say the answer is n > 1.25. However, since our precise calculation shows it's approximately 1.254, which is 1.25 when rounded to three significant figures, but if the problem allows three decimal places, maybe 1.254. However, since the given data has three significant figures, and our result of 1.254 has four, we should present it with three, so 1.25. But to check, let me think if there's any standard formula or if I made a mistake in the condition.\n\nWait, the condition for Cherenkov radiation is that the particle's speed exceeds the speed of light in the medium, v > c/n. Therefore, n > c/v. Therefore, the refractive index must be greater than c/v. Since v = beta*c, then n > 1/beta. Therefore, n > 1/beta. Therefore, if beta is approximately 0.797, then 1/beta ≈ 1.254. Therefore, the refractive index must be greater than approximately 1.25. Given that, and since the problem asks for the possible range, the answer is n > 1.25. However, if the problem expects more precise answer, maybe they want it as 1.25. But in some textbooks or resources, similar problems might present it with more decimals. For example, if I look up similar problems, sometimes they keep three decimal places. Given that, and since our precise calculation is about 1.254, I think it's safer to present it as 1.25. But let me verify with exact calculation using more precise numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rationalize the numbers. Given that 106/140 = 53/70 ≈ 0.757142857...\n\nThen, 1 + (53/70)^2 = 1 + 2809/4900 = (4900 + 2809)/4900 = 7709/4900. Then sqrt(7709/4900) = sqrt(7709)/70 ≈ 87.8/70 ≈ 1.254. Since sqrt(7709) is approximately 87.8, as we calculated earlier. Therefore, the exact value is approximately 1.254. Therefore, if the problem allows decimal places, it's 1.25. However, since 1.25 is two decimal places, but the value is approximately 1.254, which is 1.25 when rounded to two decimal places. Wait, 1.254 rounded to two decimal places is 1.25, because the third decimal is 4. Therefore, if we present it to two decimal places, it's 1.25. However, if we present it to three decimal places, it's 1.254. Given that the original values have three significant figures, I think it's appropriate to present the answer as 1.25 (three significant figures). However, if the problem expects more precision, maybe they want 1.25. But I need to check if there is any other consideration.\n\nWait, another thought: the refractive index of a medium is usually greater than 1, so the lower bound is 1, but our calculation shows that the lower bound is 1.25. Therefore, the possible range is n > 1.25. However, if the refractive index could be less than 1 (which is possible in some media for certain frequencies), but for Cherenkov radiation to occur, you need n > 1.25. However, since in most cases n ≥ 1, the possible range is n > 1.25. Therefore, the answer is n > 1.25.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose I use the relativistic beta and gamma.\n\nWe had gamma ≈ 1.6566, beta ≈ 0.797. Then, the velocity is beta*c ≈ 0.797c. Therefore, to have v > c/n => 0.797c > c/n => n > 1/0.797 ≈ 1.254. Therefore, same result. Therefore, the answer is n > 1.25. Given that the problem asks for the possible range, and since there is no upper bound on n (as long as the medium can support Cherenkov radiation), the possible range is n > 1.25. Therefore, I think this is the answer expected.\n\nTherefore, after all these calculations and checks, I conclude that the refractive index must be greater than approximately 1.25. Given the problem's data with three significant figures, the answer is n > 1.25. However, to be precise, since our calculation shows it's approximately 1.254, if the problem allows more decimals, it would be better to write 1.25. But since 1.25 is already three significant figures (assuming the decimal is there), but actually, 1.25 has three significant figures. Yes, the number 1.25 has three significant figures. Therefore, the answer is n > 1.25.\n\nBut to check once more, let me compute with exact numbers:\n\nIf n = 1.25, then c/n = c / 1.25 = 0.8c. The muon's speed is 0.797c, which is less than 0.8c. Therefore, if n is 1.25, then the muon's speed is less than c/n, and Cherenkov radiation would not occur. Therefore, our approximate value of 1.25 is actually slightly below the true threshold. Therefore, we need to round up to ensure that n > 1.25. Since with n = 1.25, it's insufficient, we need n > 1.25. Given that our precise calculation is approximately 1.254, to express this with three significant figures, we should write it as 1.25, but recognizing that it's actually slightly higher. However, in terms of significant figures, since the given data has three, the answer should also have three. Therefore, the answer is n > 1.25.\n\nBut this seems contradictory, because if we write n > 1.25, but the actual threshold is ~1.254, then technically, values like n = 1.25 would not satisfy the condition. However, due to rounding, we have to consider the precision. Given that the original values are given as 140 MeV/c and 106 MeV, which might have some implicit precision. If these values are precise to three significant figures, then our calculation of n_min is also precise to three significant figures. Therefore, the threshold is approximately 1.25, and any n greater than 1.25 would satisfy the condition, considering the precision of the given values. Therefore, the answer is n > 1.25.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more precise and avoid the rounding issue, we could write the answer as n > 1.25, acknowledging that the exact value is approximately 1.25, but due to rounding, the precise lower bound is slightly higher. However, in most textbook problems, this is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is that the refractive index must be greater than approximately 1.25. Therefore, the possible range for n is n > 1.25.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe possible range for the refractive index $ n $ of the medium is \\boxed{1.25} < n.\n</think>"}
