Hmm, there's a lot of information here, so I need to organize it properly. Maybe using a Venn diagram would help? Or maybe some set theory formulas?\n\nFirst, let me note down all the given data:\n\n- Total number of students: 360\n- 15 take all three subjects: calculus, physics, and chemistry.\n- 15 don't take any of them.\n- 180 take calculus.\n- Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics. So, if I let the number of physics students be P, then chemistry students would be 2P.\n- 75 take both calculus and chemistry. But wait, does this include those who take all three? Probably yes. In set theory terms, when they say \"both A and B,\" it usually includes those who are also in the third set. So, the intersection of calculus and chemistry includes those in all three.\n- Similarly, 75 take both physics and chemistry. Again, including those who take all three.\n- 30 take both physics and calculus. Also including those who take all three.\n\nSo, the problem is to find P, the number of students taking physics.\n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets. The formula for the union of three sets A, B, C is:\n\n|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|\n\nIn this case, the total number of students taking at least one subject is total students minus those taking none, which is 360 - 15 = 345.\n\nSo, applying the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n345 = |Calculus| + |Physics| + |Chemistry| - |Calculus ∩ Physics| - |Calculus ∩ Chemistry| - |Physics ∩ Chemistry| + |Calculus ∩ Physics ∩ Chemistry|\n\nWe know:\n\n- |Calculus| = 180\n- |Chemistry| = 2P\n- |Physics| = P\n- |Calculus ∩ Physics| = 30 (but this includes the 15 who take all three)\n- |Calculus ∩ Chemistry| = 75\n- |Physics ∩ Chemistry| = 75\n- |Calculus ∩ Physics ∩ Chemistry| = 15\n\nSo plugging these into the equation:\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side step by step.\n\nFirst, 180 + P + 2P is 180 + 3P.\n\nThen subtract 30, 75, 75: so 180 + 3P - 30 - 75 - 75.\n\nLet me calculate the constants: 180 - 30 - 75 - 75.\n\n180 - 30 is 150.\n\n150 - 75 is 75.\n\n75 - 75 is 0. Wait, that's strange. So the constants cancel out?\n\nThen add 15: 0 + 15 = 15.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n345 = 3P + 15\n\nTherefore, 3P = 345 - 15 = 330\n\nSo P = 330 / 3 = 110.\n\nWait, so the number of students taking physics is 110?\n\nBut let me check this again because it seems maybe too straightforward. Let me verify each step.\n\nTotal students taking at least one subject: 360 - 15 = 345. Correct.\n\nInclusion-exclusion formula: yes, that's the standard formula.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|Calculus| = 180, |Physics| = P, |Chemistry| = 2P.\n\nIntersections:\n\nCalculus ∩ Physics is 30. But wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"Only 30 take both physics and calculus.\" Hmm, does \"only\" here mean exclusive? Or does it mean that the total number (including those who also take chemistry) is 30?\n\nThis is a crucial point. In standard terminology, if they say \"75 take both calculus and chemistry,\" that would be the intersection, including those who also take physics. But when they say \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus,\" the word \"only\" might imply that it's exclusive, i.e., those who take both physics and calculus but not chemistry. But that would be different from the standard intersection.\n\nWait, this is ambiguous. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"Only 30 take both physics and calculus.\"\n\nHmm. The wording is a bit confusing. If they had said \"30 take both physics and calculus,\" without the \"only,\" it would be the intersection. But with the \"only,\" it might mean that only 30 are in both physics and calculus, excluding those who are in all three. So, if that's the case, then the intersection of physics and calculus (which includes those in all three) would be 30 + 15 = 45?\n\nBut the problem says \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus.\" So maybe \"only\" is meant to indicate that the intersection is 30, and that there are no students who take all three? But that contradicts the first statement that 15 take all three. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"15 take calculus, physics, and chemistry...\"\n\nSo there are 15 students taking all three. Then, when it says \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus,\" does that mean that the number of students taking both physics and calculus is 30, which would include those taking all three? But then if 15 are in all three, then the number taking only physics and calculus would be 30 - 15 = 15. But the wording says \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus,\" which is confusing. Maybe the \"only\" is meant to contrast with the other intersections?\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again:\n\n\"Only 30 take both physics and calculus.\"\n\nHmm. Maybe \"only\" here is used to indicate that the overlap between physics and calculus is smaller compared to others. For example, compared to 75 taking both calculus and chemistry, and 75 taking both physics and chemistry, the overlap between physics and calculus is only 30. So maybe \"only\" is just emphasizing that it's fewer, not that it's exclusive. Therefore, the 30 includes the 15 who take all three. Therefore, the intersection of physics and calculus is 30, which includes the 15 who take all three. Therefore, the value to plug into the inclusion-exclusion formula is 30.\n\nBut if that's the case, then my previous calculation is correct, leading to P = 110.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose that \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus,\" meaning that the number of students taking exactly physics and calculus is 30, not including those who take all three. Then, the intersection of physics and calculus would be 30 + 15 = 45. In that case, the value to plug into inclusion-exclusion would be 45.\n\nSo this is a critical ambiguity. The problem hinges on the interpretation of \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus.\"\n\nIn standard set terminology, the intersection of two sets includes those who are also in the third set. So if someone says \"students taking both A and B,\" it's usually the intersection, which includes those also in C. If they want to exclude those in C, they usually specify \"exactly A and B\" or \"only A and B.\"\n\nBut here, the problem says \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus.\" The word \"only\" might be intended to mean that the intersection is only 30, which would conflict with the fact that there are 15 who take all three. Therefore, maybe the problem is using \"only\" to mean that the overlap between physics and calculus is smaller compared to the overlaps between calculus and chemistry or physics and chemistry. In other words, \"only 30\" as in \"just 30, unlike the 75 for others.\"\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is using \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus\" to mean that the intersection of physics and calculus is 30, which includes the 15 who take all three. Therefore, the value to use in inclusion-exclusion is 30. Then, proceeding with that, we had:\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n345 = 180 + 3P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\nCalculating constants:\n\n180 - 30 = 150\n\n150 - 75 = 75\n\n75 - 75 = 0\n\n0 + 15 = 15\n\nTherefore:\n\n345 = 3P + 15 => 3P = 330 => P = 110.\n\nBut let me check if this answer makes sense. Let me verify with another approach.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet me use variables for different regions in the Venn diagram.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a: number of students taking only calculus\n- b: only physics\n- c: only chemistry\n- d: calculus and physics but not chemistry\n- e: calculus and chemistry but not physics\n- f: physics and chemistry but not calculus\n- g: all three, which is 15\n\nWe know that:\n\nTotal students taking at least one subject: a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 345\n\nTotal students: 360, with 15 taking none, so yes, 345.\n\nWe also know:\n\nTotal calculus students: a + d + e + g = 180\n\nTotal physics students: b + d + f + g = P\n\nTotal chemistry students: c + e + f + g = 2P\n\nAlso given:\n\nStudents taking both calculus and chemistry: e + g = 75. Since e is calculus and chemistry but not physics, and g is all three.\n\nSimilarly, students taking both physics and chemistry: f + g = 75.\n\nStudents taking both physics and calculus: d + g = ?. The problem says \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus.\" If this is the intersection, then d + g = 30. But since g is 15, then d = 15. So if \"only 30 take both physics and calculus,\" meaning that the intersection is 30, which includes the 15 who take all three, then d + g = 30 => d = 15.\n\nAlternatively, if \"only 30 take both physics and calculus\" means that d = 30 (only those taking exactly physics and calculus), then the intersection would be d + g = 30 + 15 = 45. But since the problem says \"Only 30 take both...\", maybe it's d = 30. But this is ambiguous.\n\nBut let's suppose that the problem is using standard terminology where \"take both physics and calculus\" is the intersection, which includes those taking all three. Then, since the problem says \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus,\" meaning that this intersection is only 30, which is less than others (75 for the other intersections). So in that case, d + g = 30. Since g is 15, then d = 15.\n\nSo let's proceed with that.\n\nSo:\n\nd + g = 30 => d = 15\n\nSimilarly, e + g = 75 => e = 75 - g = 75 - 15 = 60\n\nSimilarly, f + g = 75 => f = 75 - 15 = 60\n\nNow, total calculus students: a + d + e + g = 180\n\nWe have d = 15, e = 60, g = 15.\n\nTherefore, a + 15 + 60 + 15 = a + 90 = 180 => a = 90\n\nNow, total physics students: b + d + f + g = b + 15 + 60 + 15 = b + 90 = P\n\nTotal chemistry students: c + e + f + g = c + 60 + 60 + 15 = c + 135 = 2P\n\nNow, total students taking at least one subject:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f + g = 90 + b + c + 15 + 60 + 60 + 15 = 90 + b + c + 150 = 240 + b + c = 345\n\nTherefore, b + c = 345 - 240 = 105.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nFrom physics: P = b + 90 => b = P - 90\n\nFrom chemistry: 2P = c + 135 => c = 2P - 135\n\nThen, b + c = (P - 90) + (2P - 135) = 3P - 225 = 105\n\nTherefore:\n\n3P - 225 = 105 => 3P = 105 + 225 = 330 => P = 110\n\nSame result as before. Therefore, P = 110. Therefore, the number of students taking physics is 110.\n\nBut let me check if this is consistent with all numbers.\n\nSo, P = 110.\n\nThen, chemistry students: 2P = 220.\n\nFrom above:\n\nc = 2P - 135 = 220 - 135 = 85\n\nb = P - 90 = 110 - 90 = 20\n\nTherefore, b + c = 20 + 85 = 105, which matches our previous result.\n\nNow, total students in each category:\n\nOnly calculus: a = 90\n\nOnly physics: b = 20\n\nOnly chemistry: c = 85\n\nCalculus and physics only: d = 15\n\nCalculus and chemistry only: e = 60\n\nPhysics and chemistry only: f = 60\n\nAll three: g = 15\n\nLet me check total students taking at least one subject:\n\n90 + 20 + 85 + 15 + 60 + 60 + 15 = Let's add them up step by step.\n\nStart with 90 + 20 = 110\n\n110 + 85 = 195\n\n195 + 15 = 210\n\n210 + 60 = 270\n\n270 + 60 = 330\n\n330 + 15 = 345. Correct, which is 360 - 15.\n\nNow check total calculus students: a + d + e + g = 90 + 15 + 60 + 15 = 180. Correct.\n\nTotal physics students: b + d + f + g = 20 + 15 + 60 + 15 = 110. Correct.\n\nTotal chemistry students: c + e + f + g = 85 + 60 + 60 + 15 = 220. Which is 2*110 = 220. Correct.\n\nAlso, check intersections:\n\nCalculus and chemistry: e + g = 60 + 15 = 75. Correct.\n\nPhysics and chemistry: f + g = 60 + 15 = 75. Correct.\n\nPhysics and calculus: d + g = 15 + 15 = 30. Correct.\n\nAll three: 15. Correct.\n\nAll numbers check out. Therefore, the answer is 110.\n\nBut let me just think again if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Suppose that \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus\" was meant to indicate that exactly 30 take both, i.e., not taking chemistry. Then, d = 30, and the intersection of physics and calculus would be d + g = 30 + 15 = 45. Then, let's see what happens.\n\nSo if we take that interpretation:\n\nPhysics and calculus intersection is 45.\n\nThen, in inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nEarlier equation:\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - (Calculus ∩ Physics) - (Calculus ∩ Chemistry) - (Physics ∩ Chemistry) + (All three)\n\nSo, if (Calculus ∩ Physics) is 45, then:\n\n345 = 180 + 3P - 45 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\nCalculating constants:\n\n180 - 45 - 75 - 75 + 15 = 180 - 45 = 135; 135 - 75 = 60; 60 - 75 = -15; -15 + 15 = 0. So again, 345 = 3P => P = 115.\n\nBut then let's check with the Venn diagram approach.\n\nIf d = 30 (exactly physics and calculus), then:\n\nCalculus and physics intersection is d + g = 30 + 15 = 45.\n\nSo recalculating:\n\nTotal calculus: a + d + e + g = 180.\n\nWe still have e + g = 75 => e = 60\n\nf + g = 75 => f = 60\n\nSo e = 60, f = 60, g = 15, d = 30.\n\nTherefore, a + 30 + 60 + 15 = a + 105 = 180 => a = 75.\n\nTotal physics students: b + d + f + g = b + 30 + 60 + 15 = b + 105 = P\n\nTotal chemistry students: c + e + f + g = c + 60 + 60 + 15 = c + 135 = 2P\n\nTotal students: a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 75 + b + c + 30 + 60 + 60 + 15 = 75 + b + c + 165 = 240 + b + c = 345 => b + c = 105.\n\nFrom physics: b = P - 105\n\nFrom chemistry: c = 2P - 135\n\nThen, b + c = (P - 105) + (2P - 135) = 3P - 240 = 105 => 3P = 345 => P = 115.\n\nSo then P = 115, which is different. But then let's check the numbers:\n\nP = 115, so chemistry is 230.\n\nFrom chemistry: c = 230 - 135 = 95.\n\nFrom physics: b = 115 - 105 = 10.\n\nSo total students:\n\na = 75, b = 10, c = 95, d = 30, e = 60, f = 60, g = 15.\n\nTotal: 75 + 10 + 95 + 30 + 60 + 60 + 15 = Let's add:\n\n75 + 10 = 85; 85 + 95 = 180; 180 + 30 = 210; 210 + 60 = 270; 270 + 60 = 330; 330 + 15 = 345. Correct.\n\nCalculus students: 75 + 30 + 60 + 15 = 180. Correct.\n\nPhysics students: 10 + 30 + 60 + 15 = 115. Correct.\n\nChemistry students: 95 + 60 + 60 + 15 = 230. Which is 2*115 = 230. Correct.\n\nIntersections:\n\nCalculus & Physics: 30 + 15 = 45. If the problem had meant that the intersection is 45, but said \"Only 30 take both,\" which would be inconsistent. However, if \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus\" refers to exactly those two, not chemistry, then that's d = 30, and total intersection is 45. But the problem says \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus,\" which could be interpreted as exactly 30, meaning only those two subjects. However, the problem also says 15 take all three, so those 15 are included in the counts for all intersections. Therefore, if someone is taking all three, they are in the intersection of physics and calculus. Therefore, if the problem says \"Only 30 take both physics and calculus,\" it's ambiguous. It could mean that only 30 are in the intersection, which would require that there are no students in all three, which contradicts the given 15. Therefore, this suggests that the correct interpretation is that the intersection is 30, which includes the 15 who take all three. Therefore, d + g = 30, so d = 15. Therefore, leading to P = 110. Hence, the answer is 110.\n\nBut why does the problem use the word \"only\"? Maybe it's trying to indicate that when compared to other intersections. For example, compared to 75 taking both calculus and chemistry, and 75 taking both physics and chemistry, only 30 take both physics and calculus. So \"only\" is used to mean that it's fewer, not that it's exclusive. In that case, the intersection is 30, including the 15 in all three. Therefore, the answer is 110.\n\nAlternatively, if \"only\" is meant to indicate exclusive, then there's a contradiction with the 15 taking all three. Therefore, the former interpretation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 110.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 110.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of students taking physics is \\boxed{110}.\n</think>"}
