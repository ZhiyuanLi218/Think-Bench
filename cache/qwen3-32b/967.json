The charge density is given by ρ = ar, where a is a positive constant and r is the radius. The distribution extends out to a radius R. The question is about how the electric field behaves at a distance r from the center, and the options are about whether it increases or decreases linearly or non-linearly in different regions.\n\nFirst, I remember that for problems involving electric fields due to charge distributions, Gauss's Law is usually the way to go. Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed within that surface. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, where Φ is the electric flux, Q_enc is the enclosed charge, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nSince the charge distribution is spherical, the electric field should be radial and have the same magnitude at every point on a spherical Gaussian surface of radius r. So, if I consider a Gaussian surface of radius r, the electric flux through it would be E * 4πr², where E is the electric field strength at radius r.\n\nNow, the tricky part is figuring out the enclosed charge Q_enc. The charge density ρ is not constant here; it's given by ρ = ar. This means that the charge density increases linearly with the radius. However, since we're dealing with a volume charge density, we need to integrate this density over the volume enclosed by the Gaussian surface to get Q_enc.\n\nLet me break this into two cases: when r is less than or equal to R, and when r is greater than R. Because the charge distribution only exists up to radius R, beyond that (r > R), the enclosed charge would be the total charge of the entire sphere. For r < R, the enclosed charge would depend on the charge up to radius r.\n\nStarting with r ≤ R:\n\nThe charge enclosed Q_enc is the integral of ρ dV from 0 to r. Since the charge distribution is spherically symmetric, I can use spherical coordinates. The volume element dV in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr. Therefore, Q_enc = ∫ ρ * 4πr² dr from 0 to r.\n\nSubstituting ρ = ar:\n\nQ_enc = ∫ (a * r') * 4π(r')² dr' from 0 to r, where I used r' as the integration variable to avoid confusion with the upper limit r.\n\nSimplifying:\n\nQ_enc = 4πa ∫ r'^3 dr' from 0 to r = 4πa [ (r'^4)/4 ] from 0 to r = πa r^4.\n\nSo, Q_enc = πa r^4 when r ≤ R.\n\nNow, applying Gauss's Law:\n\nE * 4πr² = Q_enc / ε₀ => E = Q_enc / (4πε₀ r²) = (πa r^4) / (4πε₀ r²) ) = (a r²) / (4 ε₀).\n\nTherefore, for r ≤ R, E = (a r²) / (4 ε₀). This means that inside the charge distribution (for r < R), the electric field increases with the square of r. So, it's a non-linear increase because it's proportional to r². So, if we look at option D: \"It increases non-linearly for r < R.\" That seems to be correct for the region inside the distribution. But let's check the other regions as well to see which option is correct overall.\n\nNow, for r > R. In this case, the enclosed charge Q_enc is the total charge of the sphere, which is the integral from 0 to R of ρ * 4πr² dr. Let's compute that.\n\nQ_total = ∫ (a * r') * 4π(r')² dr' from 0 to R = same integral as before but evaluated at R. So Q_total = πa R^4.\n\nTherefore, for r > R, using Gauss's Law again:\n\nE * 4πr² = Q_total / ε₀ => E = (πa R^4) / (4πε₀ r²) ) = (a R^4) / (4 ε₀ r²).\n\nThis simplifies to E = (a R^4) / (4 ε₀ r²). So, outside the sphere, the electric field decreases with 1/r², which is the same as a point charge. Therefore, for r > R, the electric field decreases as 1/r². So, looking at the options:\n\nOption B: \"It decreases linearly for r > R.\" But 1/r² is not linear. A linear decrease would mean E is proportional to r, but here it's proportional to 1/r². So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"It increases linearly for r > R.\" No, it's decreasing, so C is wrong.\n\nOption A: \"It increases as r approaches infinity.\" Well, as r approaches infinity, E approaches zero because it's 1/r². So A is incorrect.\n\nSo the only correct option among the given ones is D: \"It increases non-linearly for r < R.\" Because inside the sphere, the electric field is proportional to r², which is non-linear (quadratic). So D is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for r ≤ R:\n\nQ_enc = ∫ ρ dV = ∫ from 0 to r of ar' * 4πr'² dr' = 4πa ∫ r'^3 dr' = πa r^4. Then E = (πa r^4) / (4πε₀ r²) = (a r²)/(4 ε₀). Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor r > R, Q_enc is πa R^4, so E = (πa R^4) / (4πε₀ r²) = (a R^4)/(4 ε₀ r²). Correct. So outside, E ∝ 1/r², decreasing with square of r. Inside, E ∝ r², increasing with square of r. Therefore, for r < R, non-linear increase. So D is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other possible interpretation. For example, maybe someone might think that for r < R, since the charge density is ρ = ar, maybe the electric field increases linearly? But no, because the enclosed charge depends on integrating ρ over the volume. Since ρ increases with r, but when you integrate over the volume, you get a higher power of r. Therefore, the electric field ends up depending on r². So, non-linear. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
