The question is about Avogadro's constant (N_A) and identifying the correct statement among the given options. Let me go through each option one by one and analyze them.\n\nStarting with option (A): \"For 16.25 g FeCl3, the number of colloidal particles of Fe(OH)3 formed by hydrolysis is 0.1 N_A.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the molar mass of FeCl3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol, and chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 g/mol. So FeCl3 would be 55.85 + 3*35.45 = 55.85 + 106.35 = 162.2 g/mol. The given mass is 16.25 g. Let me calculate the moles of FeCl3: 16.25 g / 162.2 g/mol ≈ 0.1 mol. \n\nNow, FeCl3 hydrolysis to form Fe(OH)3. The hydrolysis reaction might be something like FeCl3 + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl. Assuming complete hydrolysis, 1 mole of FeCl3 would produce 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 particles. So 0.1 mol FeCl3 would give 0.1 mol Fe(OH)3, which would be 0.1 N_A colloidal particles. But wait, colloidal particles might not be individual molecules. Fe(OH)3 colloid particles could be aggregates of many molecules, so the number of colloidal particles might be less than Avogadro's number. However, the question states \"the number of colloidal particles,\" and if we assume each colloidal particle corresponds to one Fe(OH)3 unit (which might not be the case in reality), then the calculation would be correct. But in reality, colloidal particles are aggregates, so the actual number would be much less. However, since this is a textbook problem, maybe they are assuming each Fe(OH)3 is a colloidal particle. But I need to check if the hydrolysis reaction is correct. Also, maybe the hydrolysis isn't complete? The problem says \"formed by hydrolysis\" but doesn't specify conditions. If it's complete hydrolysis, then 0.1 mol FeCl3 would produce 0.1 mol Fe(OH)3. But colloidal particles... Hmm. Maybe the answer expects that, but I'm not sure. Let me keep this in mind and check other options.\n\nOption (B): \"The number of protons in 22.4 L (at standard conditions) of argon gas is 18 N_A.\"\n\nStandard conditions are 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L. So 22.4 L of argon gas is 1 mole. Argon is a noble gas, so each atom is Ar. The number of protons in one Ar atom is its atomic number, which is 18. Therefore, in 1 mole of Ar, there are 18 moles of protons, which is 18 N_A. So this seems correct. But wait, protons per atom? Yes, each Ar atom has 18 protons. So total protons in 1 mole of Ar would be 18 N_A. So option B looks correct. Let me note that.\n\nOption (C): \"The number of hydroxyl groups in 92.0 g of glycerol (propanetriol) is 1.0 N_A.\"\n\nGlycerol is C3H8O3, also called propanetriol. Its molar mass is 3*12.01 (C) + 8*1.008 (H) + 3*16.00 (O). Let me calculate that:\n\nCarbon: 3*12.01 ≈ 36.03 g/mol\nHydrogen: 8*1.008 ≈ 8.064 g/mol\nOxygen: 3*16.00 = 48.00 g/mol\nTotal ≈ 36.03 + 8.064 + 48.00 ≈ 92.094 g/mol. \n\nSo 92.0 g is approximately 1 mole of glycerol. Each glycerol molecule has three hydroxyl (-OH) groups. Therefore, 1 mole of glycerol would have 3 moles of hydroxyl groups, which would be 3 N_A. But the option says the number is 1.0 N_A. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Unless I made a miscalculation. Wait, maybe the question is about hydroxyl groups, which are -OH. Each glycerol has three -OH groups. So 1 mole of glycerol would have 3 N_A hydroxyl groups. Therefore, option C is wrong. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption (D): \"The number of molecules of CH3Cl produced from the reaction of 1.0 mol CH4 and Cl2 under light is 1.0 N_A.\"\n\nThe reaction of methane with chlorine under light is a free radical substitution. The reaction can produce various chlorinated products: CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, depending on the conditions. The question states \"the number of molecules of CH3Cl produced from the reaction of 1.0 mol CH4 and Cl2 under light is 1.0 N_A.\" However, unless the reaction is controlled to stop at the first substitution step, which is not typically the case. In reality, multiple substitutions can occur. But the problem doesn't specify any excess or limiting reagent. If we assume that only one substitution occurs per methane molecule, then 1 mole of CH4 would produce 1 mole of CH3Cl, which is 1.0 N_A molecules. However, in practice, without specific conditions to limit substitution, this might not be the case. But since the problem is likely assuming a 1:1 substitution (maybe it's a simplified version), perhaps they consider it correct. However, in reality, the reaction can go further. But maybe in the problem's context, they consider that only one mole of CH3Cl is formed. However, without more information, this is ambiguous. However, in most standard problems, unless stated otherwise, they might assume that only one substitution occurs. But I need to think again. For example, if you have 1 mole of CH4 and excess Cl2, you might get multiple substitutions, but if Cl2 is limited or the reaction is controlled, maybe only one. However, the problem doesn't specify. Therefore, this might be a trick question. Since the problem says \"under light\", which typically allows for multiple substitutions unless otherwise stated. However, in some cases, the primary product is CH3Cl. But without knowing the stoichiometry or the reaction conditions (like excess Cl2 or not), we can't be sure. Therefore, this option might be incorrect because the actual number could be less than 1.0 N_A if multiple substitutions occur. However, in some textbooks, they might present this substitution as a 1:1 reaction for simplicity. Hmm. This is a bit tricky.\n\nNow, going back to the options. Let me recap:\n\nOption B seems correct based on the protons in argon. Let me double-check:\n\nArgon is monoatomic, 22.4 L at STP is 1 mole. Each Ar atom has 18 protons. So total protons is 18 * N_A. Yes. So B is correct.\n\nOption A: If FeCl3 hydrolysis gives Fe(OH)3 colloid. Assuming 0.1 mol FeCl3 gives 0.1 mol Fe(OH)3, but colloidal particles... If each colloidal particle is one Fe(OH)3 molecule, then it's 0.1 N_A. However, colloidal particles are typically aggregates of many molecules. For example, in a colloid, each particle might consist of thousands of molecules. Therefore, the number of colloidal particles would be much less than 0.1 N_A. But in the absence of specific information, maybe the question assumes that each Fe(OH)3 is a colloidal particle. However, that's not accurate. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption D: If the reaction is 1:1, then D is correct. However, in reality, unless the reaction is controlled, multiple substitutions can occur. However, maybe the problem is considering only the first substitution. For example, the reaction might be CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl under light. If that's the case, then 1 mole of CH4 would produce 1 mole of CH3Cl. However, in reality, with excess Cl2 and continued light, more substitution can happen. But if the problem states that the reaction is between 1.0 mol CH4 and Cl2 under light, and asks for the number of CH3Cl molecules produced. If the Cl2 is in stoichiometric amount for one substitution, then it's correct. But the problem doesn't specify the amount of Cl2. Therefore, this is ambiguous. However, in standard problems, unless told otherwise, sometimes they assume the first substitution. But I'm not sure. \n\nComparing options B and D. Since B seems straightforward and correct, while D is ambiguous. However, let's check the numbers again.\n\nFor option D: The reaction of CH4 with Cl2 in sunlight is a free radical substitution. The reaction can proceed through multiple steps. The first substitution is CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl. But if there's excess Cl2, the CH3Cl can further react to form CH2Cl2, etc. However, the problem says \"the reaction of 1.0 mol CH4 and Cl2 under light\". The problem doesn't specify the amount of Cl2. If Cl2 is in excess, then multiple substitutions can occur, leading to less CH3Cl. However, if Cl2 is limited, maybe only one substitution. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we are to assume that only one substitution occurs, making D correct. However, in reality, without specific conditions, this is an assumption. However, in many textbook problems, when they ask about substitution reactions without specifying, they often consider only the first substitution. For example, if you have 1 mole of CH4 and 1 mole of Cl2, you get 1 mole of CH3Cl. So maybe D is correct. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick us. For example, maybe the reaction produces multiple products. But the question is about the number of CH3Cl molecules produced. If the reaction is not 100% efficient or goes further, then the number would be less. But since the problem states \"the number of molecules of CH3Cl produced\", perhaps it's assuming complete conversion to CH3Cl. However, in reality, substitution reactions are not 100% efficient and can have multiple products. But again, without more info, this is ambiguous.\n\nComparing B and D. B seems definitely correct. D is questionable. However, let's check the math again for D. If 1 mole of CH4 reacts with Cl2 to produce 1 mole of CH3Cl, then yes, it would be 1.0 N_A molecules. But if the reaction isn't complete or if there are side reactions, then it's less. But since the problem doesn't mention any of that, maybe they expect us to assume ideal conditions. In that case, D would be correct. However, I need to think about standard problems. For example, in a typical substitution reaction problem, if you have 1 mole of CH4 and 1 mole of Cl2, you get 1 mole of CH3Cl and 1 mole of HCl. But in reality, the reaction is more complex. However, for the purpose of this problem, maybe D is considered correct. However, I'm not 100% sure. \n\nBut let's also check the other options again. Option C was definitely wrong. Option A is probably wrong because colloidal particles are not individual molecules. So between B and D. \n\nOption B is about protons in argon. Since argon is a monoatomic gas, 22.4 L at STP is 1 mole. Each Ar atom has 18 protons. So total protons is 18 * N_A. So option B is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. However, let me check again. \n\nWait, option D: If the reaction is CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl, then 1 mole of CH4 would produce 1 mole of CH3Cl. But in reality, the reaction requires UV light and can have multiple substitutions. However, if the problem is assuming that only one substitution occurs, then D is correct. But since the problem says \"under light\", which is the condition for the reaction, but doesn't specify any other conditions. In some textbooks, this substitution is considered as a 1:1 reaction unless stated otherwise. However, in reality, without controlling the amount of Cl2, you can't be sure. \n\nBut given that the problem is multiple choice and only one answer is correct, and B seems correct, whereas D is questionable. However, let me check the options again. The options are A, B, C, D. The correct answer is likely B and D? Or only one is correct. Wait, the question says \"the correct statement is ( )\", implying only one correct answer. \n\nSo between B and D. Let me think again. \n\nFor option D: The problem says \"the number of molecules of CH3Cl produced from the reaction of 1.0 mol CH4 and Cl2 under light is 1.0 N_A.\" If the reaction is allowed to go to completion with excess Cl2, then you might end up with CCl4, but if you have just enough Cl2 for one substitution, then you get CH3Cl. However, the problem does not specify the amount of Cl2. Therefore, the answer is ambiguous. However, in standard stoichiometry problems, if you have 1 mole of CH4 reacting with Cl2 to form CH3Cl, assuming 1:1 ratio, then D is correct. But since the problem doesn't specify, it's a bit of a trap. However, in many cases, such substitution problems assume that only one substitution occurs unless stated otherwise. For example, if you look up similar problems, they often assume that. Therefore, maybe D is also correct. \n\nBut then there would be two correct answers, B and D. But the options are given as A, B, C, D. The original question is in Chinese, but translated here. The user hasn't specified if multiple answers are possible, but the way it's written, it's likely only one correct answer. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. The user lists options A through D. The original problem is likely from a Chinese exam, which usually has single correct answers. So between B and D. Which one is correct? \n\nLet me think again. For option B: 22.4 L Ar at STP is 1 mole. Each Ar atom has 18 protons. Therefore, total protons is 18 * N_A. So B is correct. \n\nFor option D: If the reaction is CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl, then 1 mole of CH4 would produce 1 mole of CH3Cl. But in reality, unless the reaction is stopped at the first substitution, which requires specific conditions (like limiting Cl2 and using a radical inhibitor for further substitution), multiple substitutions can occur. However, in the absence of specific information, can we assume that only one substitution occurs? In many basic chemistry problems, substitution reactions are often simplified to show only the first substitution unless stated otherwise. For example, in the halogenation of alkanes, the primary product is often the mono-substituted product when using a 1:1 ratio. However, in reality, the reaction mixture would contain multiple products. But for stoichiometry problems, sometimes they assume that only the first substitution occurs. \n\nGiven that, perhaps D is also correct. But this is conflicting with B. However, the problem might have only one correct answer. Let me check calculations again. \n\nWait, for option D, the reaction is CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl. So 1 mole of CH4 produces 1 mole of CH3Cl. Therefore, number of molecules is 1.0 N_A. So if this is the case, then D is correct. But in reality, unless the reaction is controlled, it's not necessarily the case. But again, for the sake of the problem, maybe they consider it correct. \n\nBut then why is B there? Let me check if there's a mistake in B. \n\nOption B says \"the number of protons in 22.4 L (at standard conditions) of argon gas is 18 N_A.\" \n\nStandard conditions (STP) for gas: 22.4 L = 1 mole. Argon is monoatomic, so 1 mole of Ar atoms. Each Ar atom has 18 protons (atomic number 18). Therefore, total protons is 18 * N_A. So B is correct. \n\nSo both B and D could be correct? But the problem is presented as having one correct answer. Maybe I made a mistake in D. Let me think again. \n\nThe reaction of methane with chlorine under light is a free radical substitution. The reaction proceeds through initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The propagation steps include:\n\n1. CH4 + Cl• → CH3• + HCl\n2. CH3• + Cl2 → CH3Cl + Cl•\n\nThis cycle can repeat, leading to multiple substitutions. However, if the amount of Cl2 is limited, the reaction might stop at the first substitution. But the problem states \"the reaction of 1.0 mol CH4 and Cl2 under light\". The problem doesn't specify the amount of Cl2. If Cl2 is in excess, then multiple substitutions can occur. However, if the problem assumes that exactly 1 mole of Cl2 is used, then it would produce 1 mole of CH3Cl. But since the problem doesn't specify, it's ambiguous. \n\nIn most textbook problems, when you're given a reaction like this without specifying the amount of Cl2, they often assume that only one substitution occurs. For example, in the reaction CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl, the stoichiometry is 1:1:1:1. Therefore, if you start with 1 mole of CH4 and 1 mole of Cl2, you get 1 mole of CH3Cl. However, in reality, the reaction may not go to completion and may produce multiple products. However, for the purpose of this problem, maybe we are to assume ideal conditions where only CH3Cl is formed. \n\nBut if that's the case, then both B and D are correct? However, looking back at the options, the original problem may have only one correct answer. Let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\n(A) ... 0.1 N_A (probably incorrect)\n\n(B) ... 18 N_A (seems correct)\n\n(C) ... 1.0 N_A (incorrect, should be 3 N_A)\n\n(D) ... 1.0 N_A (possibly correct if assuming first substitution)\n\nBut if both B and D are correct, but the problem is from a source that expects only one answer, there must be something wrong with my analysis. Let me check the options again. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in option D. Let's think about the reaction. The reaction of methane with chlorine can produce multiple products. However, the question is about the number of CH3Cl molecules produced. If the reaction is not 100% efficient, then the number would be less than 1.0 N_A. But the problem states \"the number of molecules of CH3Cl produced from the reaction of 1.0 mol CH4 and Cl2 under light is 1.0 N_A.\" This implies that all the CH4 is converted to CH3Cl, which is not typically the case unless the reaction is controlled. However, in the absence of specific information, can we assume that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is not 1:1. For example, if you have 1 mole of CH4 and excess Cl2, you might end up with more Cl than CH3Cl. But the problem says \"the number of molecules of CH3Cl produced\", not the maximum possible. Without knowing the yield, we can't say it's 1.0 N_A. Therefore, option D is incorrect because it's making an assumption about the reaction going to completion with only one substitution, which isn't guaranteed. \n\nTherefore, only option B is definitely correct. \n\nThus, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
