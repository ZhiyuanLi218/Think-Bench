{"question":"Optometrists use a linear scale of lens power, measured in diopters, to prescribe corrective lenses. Sufferers of myopia, or nearsightedness, have difficulty resolving distant objects because the lenses in their eyes are too strong.

Myopia (nearsightedness) is corrected with such lenses because they help spread out the incoming light rays before they reach the eye, allowing the eye to focus the image correctly on the retina.\n\nThe **focal length** of a lens is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{P}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ f $ is the focal length in meters,\n- $ P $ is the power in diopters.\n\nSo for $ P = -5 $:\n\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{-5} = -0.2 \\, \\text{meters} = -20 \\, \\text{cm}\n$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the focal point is on the **same side of the lens as the object**, which is typical for a diverging lens.\n\n---\n\n### Behavior with Distant Objects\n\nWhen a **distant object** is viewed through a diverging lens, the object is effectively at **infinite distance**. In this case, the lens causes the parallel rays from the object to **diverge**, as if they are coming from the **focal point** of the lens. This creates a **virtual image** at the focal point.\n\n- **Virtual image** means the light rays do **not actually converge** at that point; instead, they appear to diverge from it.\n- **Upright image** is a characteristic of virtual images formed by diverging lenses.\n- The image is located **20 cm in front of the lens** (i.e., in the same direction as the object), which is approximately **20 cm in front of the eyes**, assuming the lens is very close to the eye.\n\n---\n\n### Eliminating Incorrect Options\n\n- **Option A** (real image): Diverging lenses cannot form real images from real objects.\n- **Option C** and **D** (inverted images): Diverging lenses always produce upright images.\n- **Option B** is the only one consistent with the properties of a diverging lens forming a virtual, upright image 20 cm in front of the eye.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about a myopic person with a -5 diopter prescription and what their corrective lenses create for distant objects. I need to figure out which of the four options is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that myopia, or nearsightedness, means the person can't see distant objects clearly. Their eyes are focusing images in front of the retina instead of on it. To correct this, they need a diverging lens, which is a concave lens. Diverging lenses have negative diopter values, so -5 D makes sense here.\n\nThe question is about the image created by the corrective lenses for distant objects. Let's think about how lenses work. For a diverging lens, when an object is at infinity (like a distant object), the lens will form a virtual image on the same side as the object. Wait, no, actually, for a diverging lens, when the object is at infinity, the image is formed at the focal point on the same side as the object. But since it's a virtual image, the rays appear to come from that point.\n\nThe formula for lens power is P = 1/f, where f is the focal length in meters. Since the power is -5 D, the focal length f = 1/P = 1/(-5) = -0.2 meters, which is -20 cm. The negative sign indicates that it's a diverging lens, and the focal length is measured from the lens towards the side where the light is coming from, which for a diverging lens would be the same side as the object. So the focal point is 20 cm in front of the lens.\n\nNow, when a distant object is viewed through a diverging lens, the lens takes the parallel rays from the object (since it's far away) and diverges them as if they are coming from the focal point. This creates a virtual image at the focal point. Virtual images are upright, right? Because real images are inverted. Since the image is formed on the same side as the object, it's virtual and upright.\n\nSo the image is upright and virtual, located at 20 cm in front of the lens. But where exactly is the lens in relation to the eye? Assuming the corrective lens is placed close to the eye, the distance from the lens to the eye is negligible. So the image is about 20 cm in front of the eyes. Therefore, the answer should be B: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\nLet me check the options again. Option B says upright, virtual, 20 cm in front. That matches what I thought. The other options: A is real image, but diverging lenses can't form real images with real objects. C and D mention inverted images, but diverging lenses produce upright images. So B is the correct choice.\n</think>"}
