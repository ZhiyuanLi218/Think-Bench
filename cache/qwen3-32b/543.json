I need to find the acceleration of a particle that's moving with uniform acceleration, and its velocity is increasing. The problem says that during time interval t, the displacement is s, and the kinetic energy becomes 9 times its original value. The options for acceleration are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me recall some physics concepts. Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², right? So if the kinetic energy becomes 9 times its original value, then the velocity must have tripled because kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared. Let me check that. If KE_initial = (1/2)mv₁² and KE_final = (1/2)mv₂², then KE_final / KE_initial = (v₂²)/(v₁²) = 9. Taking square roots, v₂ / v₁ = 3. So yes, the final velocity is three times the initial velocity. That seems right.\n\nSo, if the particle is under uniform acceleration, its acceleration is constant. Let me denote initial velocity as u, final velocity as v, acceleration as a, time as t, displacement as s.\n\nFrom the problem, we have that v = 3u. Because the kinetic energy increased 9 times, so velocity tripled.\n\nAlso, since it's uniformly accelerated motion, we can use the equations of motion. Let me recall them:\n\n1. v = u + at\n2. s = ut + (1/2)at²\n3. v² = u² + 2as\n\nSince we know that v = 3u, maybe I can use equation 1 and equation 2 together.\n\nFrom equation 1: v = u + at. Since v = 3u, substitute:\n\n3u = u + a t => 3u - u = a t => 2u = a t => u = (a t)/2.\n\nSo the initial velocity u is (a t)/2. Now, let's plug this into equation 2 for displacement s.\n\ns = u t + (1/2)a t². Substitute u:\n\ns = [(a t)/2] * t + (1/2)a t² = (a t²)/2 + (a t²)/2 = a t². Therefore, s = a t² => a = s / t². Wait, that gives acceleration as s/t², which is option B. But hold on, let me check if this is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me verify again. Because according to this, if s = a t², then a = s/t². But the answer options have different coefficients. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting from v = 3u. Then from v = u + at:\n\n3u = u + a t => 2u = a t => u = (a t)/2. Correct.\n\nThen displacement s = u t + ½ a t². Substituting u:\n\ns = (a t / 2) * t + ½ a t² = (a t²)/2 + (a t²)/2 = a t². Therefore, s = a t² => a = s / t². So that would be option B. But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the third equation of motion. Let's try that. The third equation is v² = u² + 2 a s. Since v = 3u, substitute:\n\n(3u)² = u² + 2 a s => 9u² = u² + 2 a s => 8u² = 2 a s => 4u² = a s => a = 4u² / s. Hmm, but how does that help me? I need to relate this to time t. Maybe combine with equation 1 again.\n\nFrom equation 1, we had u = (a t)/2. Let me substitute that into this expression for a. So:\n\na = 4u² / s = 4*( (a t)/2 )² / s = 4*(a² t² / 4)/s = (a² t²)/s. Therefore:\n\na = (a² t²)/s => Multiply both sides by s:\n\na s = a² t² => Divide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0):\n\ns = a t² => a = s / t². Same result as before. So that would be option B. But wait, let me check again if there is a mistake in assuming something.\n\nWait, the problem says \"uniformly accelerated linear motion with an increasing velocity\". So acceleration is constant and in the direction of velocity. So equations of motion are valid. Also, kinetic energy becomes 9 times. So velocity triples. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Let's take numerical example. Suppose initial velocity u, final velocity 3u. Let me pick numbers. Let me assume u = 2 m/s, then final velocity is 6 m/s. Let me choose a time t = 2 seconds. Then acceleration a = (v - u)/t = (6 - 2)/2 = 2 m/s². Then displacement s = ut + ½ a t² = 2*2 + 0.5*2*4 = 4 + 4 = 8 m. Then according to the formula a = s / t², a = 8 / 4 = 2 m/s². Which matches. So that works. Therefore, acceleration is s/t². Which is option B. So answer is B?\n\nBut wait, the options given are (A) 2s/t², (B) s/t², etc. So according to my calculation, answer is B. But maybe I made wrong assumption?\n\nWait, but let me check another example. Suppose u is zero? Wait, can u be zero? If initial velocity is zero, then kinetic energy initially is zero. Then if kinetic energy becomes 9 times, it would still be zero? No, that's impossible. Therefore, initial velocity cannot be zero. So in my previous example, u is non-zero. Therefore, seems okay.\n\nBut let me check another case. Suppose initial velocity u, acceleration a, time t, displacement s. From above, we have two equations:\n\nv = 3u,\n\nand from v = u + a t => 3u = u + a t => a t = 2u => u = a t / 2,\n\nand displacement s = u t + ½ a t² = (a t / 2)*t + ½ a t² = (a t²)/2 + (a t²)/2 = a t². So s = a t² => a = s / t². Therefore, answer is B. So why is there an option A as 2s/t²? Maybe my mistake is in assuming that the kinetic energy is 9 times the initial value. Wait, maybe the problem is in the frame of reference or something else?\n\nWait, kinetic energy depends on velocity squared. If the particle is accelerating, then its velocity changes. The problem says \"kinetic energy becomes 9 times its original value\". So original value is (1/2)m u², final is (1/2)m v² = 9*(1/2)m u², so v² = 9 u² => v = 3u (since velocity is increasing, so positive direction). Therefore, correct. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering average velocity or something else? No, kinetic energy is a function of instantaneous velocity. If after time t, the kinetic energy is 9 times, so at time t, the velocity is 3u. So equations are correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I need to use work-energy theorem? The work done by the net force equals the change in kinetic energy. The work done is force times displacement (since force is constant, in direction of displacement). So Work = F * s = m a s. And the change in kinetic energy is (1/2)m v² - (1/2)m u² = (1/2)m (9u² - u²) = 4 m u². Therefore:\n\nm a s = 4 m u² => a s = 4 u² => a = 4 u² / s. But earlier from equation of motion, we had a = s / t². Therefore:\n\nFrom a = s / t² and a = 4 u² / s, so:\n\ns / t² = 4 u² / s => s² / t² = 4 u² => s / t = 2 u => u = s / (2 t). But from before, we had u = a t / 2. Since a = s / t², then u = (s / t²)*t / 2 = s / (2 t). Which matches. Therefore, consistent. Therefore, no contradiction here. So all equations are consistent. Therefore, acceleration is s / t². So answer is B.\n\nBut why does the problem give this as an option? Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"during the time interval t, the displacement is s, and the kinetic energy becomes 9 times its original value\". So during the time t, displacement is s, and at the end of that time, KE is 9 times. Which is what I considered. So my approach is correct. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nBut let me check the options again. Option B is s/t². So answer is B. But I need to check if maybe there is a different approach where answer is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could think that average velocity is s/t, and relate that to initial and final velocity. For uniformly accelerated motion, average velocity is (u + v)/2. So s = (u + v)/2 * t. Since v = 3u, then s = (u + 3u)/2 * t = 2u * t. Therefore, s = 2 u t => u = s/(2t). Then acceleration a = (v - u)/t = (3u - u)/t = 2u / t = 2*(s/(2t))/t = s / t². Same result. Therefore, answer is B. So seems correct.\n\nBut why is there an option A which is 2s/t²? Maybe if someone thought that the final velocity is sqrt(9) times initial velocity but in another way? Wait, no, KE proportional to v², so 9 times KE means 3 times velocity. So that is correct. So seems like answer is B. But let me check once more with actual numbers.\n\nLet me take u = 1 m/s, t = 2 s. Then acceleration a = s / t². What is s? From s = a t², but if I compute s from equations:\n\ns = u t + ½ a t². But also from earlier, we have u = a t / 2 => a = 2u / t. Therefore, if u = 1 m/s, t = 2 s, then a = 2*1 / 2 = 1 m/s². Then displacement s = 1*2 + 0.5*1*(2)^2 = 2 + 2 = 4 m. Then according to a = s / t², a = 4 / 4 = 1 m/s². Correct. So in this case, the acceleration is indeed s/t². Therefore, answer is B. So why is this a problem? Maybe there's a trick?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question? Let me check again. \"A particle is undergoing uniformly accelerated linear motion with an increasing velocity. During the time interval t, the displacement is s, and the kinetic energy becomes 9 times its original value. The acceleration of the particle is...\"\n\nNo, seems straightforward. So answer is B. But maybe the original question is in Chinese and there was a translation error? No, the user wrote it in English. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the average acceleration? But no, acceleration is uniform, so average acceleration is same as instantaneous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the velocity increases by 9 times? But no, it says kinetic energy increases by 9 times, which is velocity tripling. If it was velocity increasing 9 times, then answer would be different. Let me check. If someone thought that KE is proportional to velocity, which is wrong, then they would think velocity increases 9 times, leading to v = 9u. Then from v = u + a t: 9u = u + a t => 8u = a t => u = a t / 8. Then displacement s = u t + ½ a t² = (a t / 8)*t + ½ a t² = (a t²)/8 + (4 a t²)/8 = 5 a t² /8 => a = 8 s / (5 t²), which is not among options. So no. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the final KE is 9 times the initial, but forgot that KE depends on v squared, and thought velocity is 9 times, but that would be wrong. But in our case, we did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of \"during the time interval t, the displacement is s\". Maybe average velocity? But we already considered that. Or maybe the total distance? But displacement is s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another frame? No, the problem is straightforward.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\n(A) 2s/t²\n\n(B) s/t²\n\n(C) 3s/(2t²)\n\n(D) 4s/t²\n\nSo according to my calculations, answer is B. But maybe I need to check once again with different equations.\n\nLet me try expressing everything in terms of a.\n\nFrom above, we had u = a t / 2.\n\nAlso, from KE consideration, v = 3u.\n\nBut also, v = u + a t = 3u => same as before.\n\nAlternatively, since we have u = a t / 2, and we can also express v = 3u = 3*(a t / 2) = (3 a t)/2.\n\nBut also, from another equation, v = u + a t = (a t / 2) + a t = (3 a t)/2. Same result. Correct.\n\nAlso, displacement s = (v² - u²)/(2a) from third equation. Let's compute that:\n\nv² - u² = ( (9 a² t² / 4 ) - (a² t² / 4 )) = (8 a² t²)/4 = 2 a² t². Therefore, s = 2 a² t² / (2a) ) = a t². Therefore, same result. So s = a t² => a = s / t². So answer is B.\n\nTherefore, unless there is some trick or misinterpretation, answer should be B. But maybe the original question had different numbers? Or maybe I made a mistake in the very beginning?\n\nWait, let me check the relation between KE and velocity again. KE is 1/2 mv². So if KE increases by factor of 9, then v increases by factor of 3. Yes. So if initial velocity is u, final velocity is 3u. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the particle starts from rest? Wait, if it starts from rest, then initial velocity u = 0. Then KE_initial is zero. Then KE_final is 9*0 = 0. Which would mean no motion. Which is not possible. Therefore, particle cannot start from rest. Therefore, initial velocity is non-zero. Which we have considered. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nBut why does option A exist? Maybe if someone thought that the final velocity squared is 9 times initial, but used another equation?\n\nWait, for example, if someone thought that average velocity is s/t, and average velocity is (u + v)/2. So s/t = (u + v)/2. And since v = 3u, then s/t = (u + 3u)/2 = 2u => u = s/(2t). Then acceleration is (v - u)/t = (3u - u)/t = 2u/t = 2*(s/(2t))/t = s/t². Same result. So still answer is B. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the displacement is s = v t, using final velocity, then s = v t. But that would be wrong because displacement with acceleration is not final velocity times time. But if someone did that, then s = v t, and since v = 3u, then s = 3u t. Then from acceleration equations, v = u + a t => 3u = u + a t => a = 2u/t. Then from s = 3u t, u = s/(3t). Therefore, a = 2*(s/(3t))/t = 2s/(3t²), which is option C. But this approach is wrong because displacement is not v t when there is acceleration. So if someone made that mistake, they would get option C. But since we know that s = (u + v)/2 * t, which is correct, then answer is B.\n\nAlternatively, if someone used s = v t - (1/2) a t²? No, that's not a standard equation. Wait, standard equations are:\n\ns = ut + ½ a t²,\n\ns = vt - ½ a t² ?\n\nLet me check. Since v = u + a t => u = v - a t. Substitute into s = ut + ½ a t²:\n\ns = (v - a t) t + ½ a t² = vt - a t² + ½ a t² = vt - ½ a t². Therefore, yes, s = vt - ½ a t². So if someone used this equation and thought that maybe they need to use this, but how?\n\nIf someone thought that since KE is 9 times, then v = 3u, but then tried to use s = v t - ½ a t², with v being final velocity. Let's see. So:\n\ns = v t - ½ a t². But v = 3u. And from v = u + a t => 3u = u + a t => a = 2u / t. Substitute into s:\n\ns = 3u t - ½*(2u / t)*t² = 3u t - ½*2u*t = 3u t - u t = 2u t. Therefore, s = 2u t => u = s/(2t). Then acceleration a = 2u / t = 2*(s/(2t))/t = s / t². Same result. Still answer is B. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if someone messed up the equations and thought that s = ½ a t², assuming initial velocity zero. If someone thought that, then s = ½ a t² => a = 2s / t², which is option A. But that would be wrong because in this case, initial velocity is not zero. However, if someone assumed initial velocity zero, then KE_initial is zero, which can't be multiplied by 9 to get KE_final. But maybe the problem didn't specify initial velocity, so someone might assume initial velocity zero and proceed? But that would be inconsistent with KE changing to 9 times. However, if someone ignores that inconsistency and just goes through the math, they might pick A. But since the problem says velocity is increasing, so acceleration is in direction of velocity, but initial velocity could be non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different approach where acceleration is 2s/t². Let me think. Suppose we don't consider the kinetic energy, but just relate acceleration to displacement and time. For example, if initial velocity is zero, then s = ½ a t² => a = 2s / t². But in our case, initial velocity is not zero, so s = ut + ½ a t². But if someone thought that regardless of initial velocity, the formula is s = ½ a t², they would get A. But that is wrong unless u = 0.\n\nBut since in our problem, the initial velocity is not zero, so s is not equal to ½ a t². Therefore, answer is not A. So answer is B. Therefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n\nBut why is there confusion? Maybe in some textbooks or somewhere else similar problems? Let me think. For example, if the problem had said that the speed doubles, and asked for acceleration, maybe different answer? Let me try. Suppose KE becomes 4 times, so velocity doubles. Then following same steps: v = 2u. Then from v = u + a t => 2u = u + a t => u = a t / 1. Then displacement s = u t + ½ a t² = (a t) * t + ½ a t² = a t² + ½ a t² = 3/2 a t² => a = (2/3)s / t². So answer would be 2s/(3t²). Not in the options here. But in our problem, KE 9 times, so velocity 3 times, leading to a = s/t². So answer B.\n\nAlternatively, if KE becomes 4 times, and someone thought velocity doubles and used s = vt - ½ a t², then s = 2u t - ½*( (2u - u)/t )*t² = 2u t - ½*(u/t)*t² = 2u t - ½ u t = 3/2 u t => u = (2 s)/(3 t). Then acceleration a = (v - u)/t = (2u - u)/t = u/t = (2s)/(3t²). Which is same as before. So in that case answer would be 2s/(3t²). But in our problem, answer is s/t². So seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. However, since this is an exam problem, maybe there is something missing. Let me check once again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"uniformly accelerated linear motion with an increasing velocity\". So acceleration is constant and positive, velocity increasing. So equations are valid. The key was relating the kinetic energy to velocity. Since KE is proportional to v squared, tripling the velocity gives 9 times KE. Then using equations of motion to relate displacement, time, and acceleration. All steps seem correct, examples check out. So answer is B.\n\nBut why is option A there? Maybe if the question had said that the particle starts from rest and reaches a kinetic energy 9 times some other value? But no, the question says kinetic energy becomes 9 times its original value, implying that original value is not zero. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a different context where the acceleration is calculated differently? For example, if it's relativistic? But no, the problem is classical mechanics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in my steps? Let me check once again:\n\nFrom KE: v = 3u.\n\nFrom equation v = u + a t: 3u = u + a t => 2u = a t => u = (a t)/2.\n\nFrom equation s = u t + (1/2)a t²:\n\ns = (a t / 2)*t + (1/2)a t² = (a t²)/2 + (a t²)/2 = a t².\n\nTherefore, a = s / t². Yes, correct. So answer is B. So I think the answer is B.\n\nBut let me check with another method. Let's suppose that the acceleration is a, and we need to express it in terms of s and t. Let me write down the equations again.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) v = 3u\n\n2) v = u + a t\n\n3) s = u t + (1/2)a t²\n\nFrom 1) and 2): 3u = u + a t => a = 2u / t.\n\nFrom 3): s = u t + (1/2)a t². Substitute a from above:\n\ns = u t + (1/2)(2u / t) t² = u t + u t = 2u t => u = s / (2t).\n\nThen a = 2u / t = 2*(s/(2t))/t = s / t². Same result. So answer is B.\n\nYes, definitely. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
