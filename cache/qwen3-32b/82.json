So, the question is about contact angles of a coating on a substrate. Initially, there's a smooth surface with given static contact angles for water and oil. Then, when the coating is modified, it becomes rough, and we have advancing and receding angles for water. We need to estimate the static contact angles for both water and oil on the rough surface and determine if water droplets roll off at low or high tilt angles. The options are given as A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I remember that contact angles are related to the wettability of a surface. For smooth surfaces, the static contact angle is a single value. But when the surface is rough, the contact angle can be either higher (advancing) or lower (receding), leading to a contact angle hysteresis. The static contact angle in such cases is sometimes taken as the average of the advancing and receding angles, but I need to confirm if that's the standard approach here.\n\nGiven that the rough surface has advancing and receding water contact angles of 133° and 125°, the static contact angle would be the average of these two. Let me calculate that: (133 + 125)/2 = 258/2 = 129°. So, the static water contact angle is 129°, which matches options A and B.\n\nNow, for the oil contact angle. The original smooth surface had a static oil contact angle of 76°. When the surface becomes rough, how does that affect the oil contact angle? I recall that the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter models describe how surface roughness affects contact angles. \n\nThe Wenzel model assumes the liquid fully wets the roughness, leading to a contact angle that is modified by the roughness factor (r). The formula is cosθ_r = r * cosθ, where θ is the contact angle on a smooth surface and θ_r is the contact angle on the rough surface. However, this model increases the contact angle if the original angle is greater than 90°, or decreases it if it's less than 90°. But wait, oil has a lower contact angle (76°), which is less than 90°, so making the surface rough would decrease the contact angle further, making it more wettable. But the options for oil are 98° or 48°, which are both higher and lower than 76°. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the Cassie-Baxter model applies here. The Cassie-Baxter model involves air pockets trapped under the droplet, leading to a higher contact angle. But this depends on whether the liquid is in the Wenzel or Cassie state.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify whether the rough surface is in Wenzel or Cassie-Baxter regime. However, the original smooth surface had a contact angle of 76° for oil, which is less than 90°, so it's hydrophilic. If the surface becomes rough, according to Wenzel, the contact angle would decrease further. So cosθ_r = r * cosθ. Let's rearrange that. If θ is 76°, then cos(76°) ≈ 0.2419. If the surface is rough, say r is greater than 1 (which it always is for rough surfaces), then cosθ_r would be r * 0.2419. Wait, but if r is greater than 1, then cosθ_r would be larger than 0.2419, which would mean θ_r is smaller than 76°, because cosine is decreasing in 0-180. So the contact angle would decrease. But the options for oil are 98° or 48°. 48° is lower than 76°, which would make sense if Wenzel applies. But 98° is higher. However, if the surface is in Cassie-Baxter, which is when the liquid doesn't fully wet the roughness and is supported on peaks with air pockets, the formula is cosθ_r = φ (cosθ - 1) + 1, where φ is the fraction of the solid-liquid contact area. But without knowing φ, it's hard to calculate. However, since the original contact angle is 76°, which is less than 90°, the Cassie-Baxter model would require that the liquid is in a state where it's supported on the roughness with air pockets, which might not be the case here. \n\nBut the problem states that the coating is modified to produce a rough surface. The original smooth surface had a static contact angle of 76° for oil. When made rough, the contact angle could either increase or decrease depending on the model. However, since water's contact angle increased from 104° to an average of 129°, which is higher, suggesting that the roughness is increasing the contact angle for water. For water, the original angle was 104°, which is greater than 90°, so Wenzel would predict an increase in contact angle. For oil, original angle is 76°, so Wenzel would predict a decrease. But the options don't have a decrease for oil. The options for oil are 98° or 48°. If 48° is lower than 76°, that would fit the Wenzel model. However, the problem is that the question is about the static contact angle for oil on the rough surface. If the surface is rough and the oil contact angle is in the Wenzel regime, then the static contact angle would be lower. But the options don't have 48° paired with 129° for water. Let me check the options again:\n\nA: Water = 129°, Oil = 98°, low tilt angle\n\nB: Water = 129°, Oil = 98°, high tilt angle\n\nC: Water = 128°, Oil = 48°, high tilt angle\n\nD: Water = 128°, Oil = 48°, low tilt angle\n\nWait, the calculated average for water is 129°, but option C and D have 128°. Maybe there's a slight difference in calculation. Let me check again: (133 + 125) = 258. 258 divided by 2 is 129. So 129°. But option C and D have 128°. Maybe a typo or maybe they used a different method? Maybe the static contact angle is taken as the advancing angle, but that's not standard. Usually, the static is the average. Hmm. However, the problem says \"best estimate\". If the average is 129°, but option C and D have 128°, maybe there's a mistake in the problem or the options. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to use the Wenzel equation for both water and oil, but that seems inconsistent because the water contact angle is in the Wenzel regime (since original is 104°, which is greater than 90°, so roughness would increase it), but oil is in the Wenzel regime and would decrease. But the problem doesn't give the roughness factor. How can we calculate it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the difference between advancing and receding angles for water to estimate the static angle as the average, which is 129°, and for oil, since the original static is 76°, and the surface is rough, perhaps the oil contact angle is also affected similarly. But how?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't give any advancing or receding angles for oil. So maybe we can't calculate the static oil contact angle directly. However, the question is asking for the best estimate. Since the water contact angle increased due to roughness (from 104° to 129°), maybe oil contact angle would also be affected in a similar way? But oil had a lower contact angle. If we use the Wenzel model for oil: cosθ_r = r * cosθ. Let's suppose that for water, the original contact angle was 104°, and the rough surface has a contact angle of 129°. Let's calculate the roughness factor r for water. \n\nUsing Wenzel's equation:\n\ncosθ_r = r * cosθ\n\nSo, cos(129°) = r * cos(104°)\n\nCalculating cos(129°): cos(129°) ≈ cos(90+39) = -sin(39) ≈ -0.6293\n\ncos(104°) ≈ cos(90+14) = -sin(14) ≈ -0.2419\n\nSo:\n\n-0.6293 = r * (-0.2419)\n\nr ≈ (-0.6293)/(-0.2419) ≈ 2.6\n\nSo the roughness factor is approximately 2.6.\n\nNow, applying the same roughness factor to the oil contact angle:\n\nOriginal oil contact angle is 76°, so cos(76°) ≈ 0.2419\n\nThen, cosθ_r = 2.6 * 0.2419 ≈ 0.629\n\nSo θ_r = arccos(0.629) ≈ 51°\n\nWhich is close to option C and D's 48°. Since the calculation gives ~51°, which is closest to 48° or 50°, and the options have 48°, that would suggest oil contact angle is 48°. So the static oil contact angle would be 48°, which is in options C and D.\n\nSo for water, the static angle is 129° (average of 133 and 125), and oil is 48°, so options C and D. Now, the question is whether the water droplets roll off at low or high tilt angles. Rolling off is related to the contact angle hysteresis. The contact angle hysteresis is the difference between advancing and receding angles. For water, the hysteresis is 133 - 125 = 8°. A low hysteresis means the surface is more homogeneous and the droplet can roll off easily at low tilt angles. A high hysteresis means the droplet sticks more, requiring higher tilt angles. Since the hysteresis here is only 8°, which is low, water droplets would roll off at low tilt angles. Therefore, the answer would be D: Water = 128°, Oil = 48°, low tilt angle. Wait, but earlier calculation for water static angle was 129°, but option D has 128°. There might be a discrepancy here. Maybe the average was calculated differently? If the advancing is 133 and receding 125, the average is 129, but maybe the question expects us to use a different method, like taking the advancing angle as the static? But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo and 129 is actually 128. If the calculation using Wenzel for water gives 129°, but the options have 128°, perhaps the answer is D. But why would the water static angle be 128°? Maybe there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me check the average again: (133 + 125) = 258. Divided by 2 is 129. So 129°. But option D says 128°. Unless the question expects the average to be rounded down, but that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem. However, given the options, the closest one with 48° for oil and low tilt angle is D. But if the water contact angle is 129°, then options A and B have 129°, but D has 128°. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the static contact angle is not the average. In some contexts, the static contact angle is considered as the advancing angle, but that doesn't make sense because the advancing angle is higher. However, if the question is using the advancing angle as the static, then water would be 133°, but that's not any of the options. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the Young's equation for the static angle, but since the surface is rough, the Young's angle is different. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's recap. The key points are:\n\n1. For water, the rough surface has advancing 133°, receding 125°, so static is average 129°, which is A or B.\n\n2. For oil, using Wenzel model with r=2.6 (from water's calculation), gives oil contact angle ~51°, closest to 48°, so options C or D.\n\n3. Contact angle hysteresis for water is 8°, which is low, so low tilt angle for rolling off.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be D: Water = 128°, Oil = 48°, low tilt angle. But the water static angle calculation is 129°, but option D has 128°. This discrepancy might be due to rounding or a mistake in the options. However, given that the calculated oil contact angle is ~51°, which is closest to 48°, and the tilt angle is low, the best fit is D. Perhaps the water contact angle in the options is a typo, and the intended answer is D. Alternatively, maybe the average is 128° if they used 133 and 123, but the given receding is 125. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the Young's contact angle for the smooth surface and then applying the Wenzel model to estimate the rough surface's contact angle. For water, original Young's angle is 104°, and with roughness factor r=2.6, we get 129°, which matches the average of the given advancing and receding. For oil, original Young's angle is 76°, so applying the same r=2.6:\n\ncosθ_r = 2.6 * cos(76°) ≈ 2.6 * 0.2419 ≈ 0.629, so θ_r ≈ 51°, which is 48° in the options. Therefore, the static oil contact angle is 48°, and the tilt angle is low because hysteresis is low. So the answer must be D, even though the water contact angle in the option is 128° instead of 129°. Maybe the question expects us to use a different rounding or there's a typo. Given that, D seems the best answer.\n</think>"}
