Let's compare with the expansion of $(z + i)^4$:\n\n$$\n(z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi + 1\n$$\n\nCompare this with the given polynomial:\n\n$$\nz^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i\n$$\n\nWe can see that the only difference is the constant term: $+1$ vs $-i$. So we can write:\n\n$$\n(z + i)^4 - 1 - i = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (z + i)^4 = 1 + i\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solve for the Roots\n\nLet us define:\n\n$$\nw = z + i \\Rightarrow z = w - i\n$$\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n$$\nw^4 = 1 + i\n$$\n\nWe now find the fourth roots of $1 + i$. First, express $1 + i$ in polar form:\n\n$$\n1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} + i \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = \\sqrt{2} e^{i\\pi/4}\n$$\n\nSo the fourth roots of $1 + i$ are:\n\n$$\nw_k = \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^{1/4} \\cdot e^{i(\\pi/16 + k\\pi/2)}, \\quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n$$\n\nThis gives four roots $w_0, w_1, w_2, w_3$ that lie on a circle of radius $r = (\\sqrt{2})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8}$, and are spaced evenly at angles of $\\pi/2$ apart. Therefore, they form a square centered at the origin.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Translate the Square\n\nEach solution $z$ is given by $z = w - i$, so the entire square is translated down by $i$ (i.e., shifted vertically downward by 1 unit in the complex plane).

The solutions form a convex polygon, and I need to find the area of that polygon, expressed in some prime power form. Then, figure out the values of a, b, p and add them up. Alright, let's start.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try to factor this equation. It looks kind of complicated, but maybe it's a binomial expansion or something. Let me check. The coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Hmm. Let me think about binomial expansions. Let me recall that $ (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 $. Comparing that with the given polynomial:\n\nGiven polynomial: $ z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i $.\n\nIf I compare term by term:\n\nFirst term: $ z^4 $ vs $ a^4 $. Maybe a is z?\n\nSecond term: $ 4z^3i $ vs $ 4a^3b $. If a is z, then 4a^3b would be 4z^3b. Comparing with 4z^3i, so b = i?\n\nThird term: In binomial expansion, it's 6a^2b^2. If a = z and b = i, then 6a^2b^2 = 6z^2(i)^2 = 6z^2(-1) = -6z^2. Which matches the third term of the given polynomial! Great.\n\nFourth term: In binomial expansion, it's 4ab^3. With a = z, b = i, that's 4z(i)^3 = 4z(-i) = -4zi. Which matches the fourth term of the polynomial!\n\nFifth term: In binomial expansion, it's b^4. With b = i, that's i^4 = 1. But the given polynomial has -i as the constant term. Hmm. So if we have (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 -4zi + 1. But our equation is z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0. So if I take (z + i)^4, it equals z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1. Therefore, if I subtract something to get -i instead of +1? Let me see:\n\nLet me write:\n\n(z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1.\n\nSo if I subtract (1 + i), then:\n\n(z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1 - 1 - i = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0.\n\nTherefore, the equation given is (z + i)^4 = 1 + i. So the solutions are the fourth roots of (1 + i), shifted by -i. Therefore, z = -i + w, where w^4 = 1 + i.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the fourth roots of 1 + i, then subtract i from them, and then plot those points in the complex plane, they form a convex polygon whose area I need to compute.\n\nAlright, so first step: find the fourth roots of 1 + i.\n\nTo find roots of complex numbers, it's helpful to express them in polar form. Let me recall that 1 + i can be written in polar form as r*e^{iθ}, where r is the modulus and θ is the argument.\n\nCompute modulus: |1 + i| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).\n\nArgument θ: arctangent(1/1) = π/4. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.\n\nTherefore, the fourth roots of 1 + i will have modulus equal to (sqrt(2))^{1/4} and arguments (π/4 + 2πk)/4 for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet me compute modulus first:\n\n(sqrt(2))^{1/4} = (2^{1/2})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8}.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so taking the fourth root is 2^{(1/2)*(1/4)} = 2^{1/8}. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, modulus of each fourth root is 2^{1/8}.\n\nArguments: For k = 0, 1, 2, 3:\n\nθ_k = (π/4 + 2πk)/4 = π/(16) + πk/2.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nOriginal angle is π/4. When taking the fourth root, divide by 4, and then add multiples of 2π/4 = π/2.\n\nSo θ_k = (π/4)/4 + k*(2π)/4 = π/16 + k*(π/2). Wait, no, more accurately, the general formula for the nth roots of a complex number re^{iθ} is r^{1/n} e^{i(θ + 2πk)/n} for k = 0,...,n-1.\n\nTherefore, here n = 4, θ = π/4. So θ + 2πk = π/4 + 2πk. Divide by 4:\n\n(π/4 + 2πk)/4 = π/(16) + πk/2. So yes, θ_k = π/16 + (π/2)k for k = 0,1,2,3.\n\nTherefore, the four fourth roots of 1 + i are:\n\nw_k = 2^{1/8} * e^{i(π/16 + πk/2)} for k = 0,1,2,3.\n\nTherefore, the solutions z to the original equation are z = -i + w_k.\n\nTherefore, each solution z is obtained by taking these fourth roots and subtracting i (i.e., shifting down by i in the complex plane).\n\nSo now, to find the polygon formed by these four points. Since they are four roots of a quartic equation, they form a quadrilateral. But the problem says it's a convex polygon. Since there are four roots, it's a convex quadrilateral. However, maybe they form a square? Because roots of unity are usually on a circle and form regular polygons.\n\nBut here, the roots w_k are fourth roots of 1 + i, which is not on the unit circle. However, they are equally spaced in angle, since we have angles differing by π/2. So they lie on a circle of radius 2^{1/8} centered at the origin, and then shifted down by i. So the polygon is a square rotated and shifted?\n\nTherefore, to find the area, perhaps we can figure out the positions of the four points, compute coordinates, and then use coordinates to compute area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way by considering transformations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the four points w_k. They form a square centered at the origin, since they are four points on a circle with angles differing by π/2. Therefore, when we shift them by -i, the square is shifted down by i, but remains a square. Therefore, the polygon is a square, and we can compute its area.\n\nTherefore, if we can find the side length or the distance between two adjacent vertices, or the radius (distance from center to vertex), we can compute the area.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the original square (before shifting) is centered at the origin with radius 2^{1/8}, but shifting it down by i (which is (0,1) in coordinates) will translate the square, but not change its area. Therefore, the area of the polygon is the same as the area of the original square.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the area of the square formed by the four roots w_k, that will be the area of the polygon.\n\nBut how to compute the area of that square? Well, for a square inscribed in a circle of radius r (distance from center to vertex), the area is 2r^2. Wait, let me recall:\n\nFor a square with side length s, the diagonal is s√2. The radius of the circumscribed circle (distance from center to vertex) is half the diagonal, which is (s√2)/2 = s/√2. Therefore, r = s/√2 => s = r√2. Therefore, area is s^2 = 2r^2. Therefore, if the four roots w_k lie on a circle of radius r = 2^{1/8}, then the area of the square is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}. Wait, but is this correct?\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, if the square is centered at the origin, and the four vertices are on a circle of radius r, then yes, the area is 2r^2. But here, our square is not necessarily centered at the origin? Wait, but the four roots w_k are symmetrically placed around the origin. Since they are fourth roots of a complex number, they should be symmetrically placed. Therefore, their centroid is at the origin. Therefore, shifting them down by i will move the centroid to (0, -1). However, the area remains the same as the original square. Therefore, if I can compute the area of the original square, then that is the area of the polygon.\n\nBut let me verify this formula. Let me take r as the distance from the center to the vertex. For a square, the relation between the side length s and r is s = r * sqrt(2). Therefore, area is s^2 = 2 r^2. Therefore, with r = 2^{1/8}, area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}. But 2^{5/4} is equal to the fourth root of 32, since 2^5 = 32. Therefore, written as 32^{1/4}. However, the problem states that the area can be expressed in the form p^{a/b} where p is prime. Since 32 is 2^5, so 32^{1/4} = 2^{5/4}, so p is 2, a is 5, b is 4. Then a + b + p is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. But before I get too excited, let me check if my reasoning is correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is the original square's area really 2r^2? Let me take a simple example. Suppose the square is of side length sqrt(2), then the radius r is 1. Then area is 2, which is 2*(1)^2. Yes, that works. If the square has side length 2, then the radius is sqrt(2), so area is 4 = 2*(sqrt(2))^2. Correct. So formula holds. Therefore, if my radius is 2^{1/8}, then area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{1} * 2^{1/4} = 2^{5/4} as above.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The four roots w_k are the fourth roots of 1 + i. But 1 + i is not a real number, so the four roots are not symmetrically placed in the same way as roots of unity. Wait, but when you take roots of any complex number, they are equally spaced around a circle. So even though the original complex number isn't on the real axis, the roots are still equally spaced angles. Therefore, they form a regular polygon (a square in this case) centered at the origin. Therefore, my previous reasoning holds. Therefore, the area is 2r^2 where r is the modulus of each root, which is 2^{1/8}. Therefore, area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}.\n\nBut the problem says \"the area of this polygon can be expressed in the form p^{a/b}\". But 2^{5/4} is already in that form, with p = 2, a = 5, b = 4. Since 2 is prime, and 5 and 4 are coprime. Therefore, a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. Therefore, the answer is 11. But let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, but let me check if shifting the square down by i affects the area. Since translation doesn't change area, no. So regardless of shifting, the area remains the same. Therefore, the area of the polygon is indeed 2^{5/4}. Therefore, answer is 11. However, let me verify this with coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute coordinates of the four roots and compute the area. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, compute the four roots w_k:\n\nEach w_k is 2^{1/8} * e^{iθ_k}, where θ_k = π/16 + πk/2, for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet me compute θ for each k:\n\nFor k = 0: θ_0 = π/16 ≈ 11.25 degrees\n\nFor k = 1: θ_1 = π/16 + π/2 = π/16 + 8π/16 = 9π/16 ≈ 101.25 degrees\n\nFor k = 2: θ_2 = π/16 + π = π/16 + 16π/16 = 17π/16 ≈ 191.25 degrees\n\nFor k = 3: θ_3 = π/16 + 3π/2 = π/16 + 24π/16 = 25π/16 ≈ 281.25 degrees\n\nSo these angles are spaced 90 degrees apart (π/2), starting at π/16. So they form a square rotated by π/16 - π/4? Wait, the square is rotated by θ_0 = π/16. So relative to the real axis, the first root is at π/16, then each subsequent one is 90 degrees more. Therefore, the square is rotated.\n\nBut when we shift them by -i, which is (0, -1) in coordinates, each point (x, y) becomes (x, y - 1). However, since the original square is centered at (0, 0), after shifting down by 1, the center is at (0, -1). However, the shape remains a square, just translated. Therefore, the area is the same as before.\n\nBut maybe I can compute coordinates for two adjacent points and compute the distance between them to check the side length.\n\nLet me compute coordinates for w_0 and w_1.\n\nFirst, compute w_0:\n\nw_0 = 2^{1/8} * [cos(π/16) + i sin(π/16)]\n\nSimilarly, w_1 = 2^{1/8} * [cos(9π/16) + i sin(9π/16)]\n\nTherefore, the distance between w_0 and w_1 is |w_1 - w_0|.\n\nBut since they are adjacent vertices of a square, this distance is the side length.\n\nAlternatively, since the square is inscribed in a circle of radius r = 2^{1/8}, the side length s is 2r sin(π/4) = 2r*(√2/2) = r√2. Wait, let me recall that in a regular n-gon, the side length is 2r sin(π/n). For n = 4, that is 2r sin(π/4) = 2r*(√2/2) = r√2. Therefore, side length s = r√2. Therefore, area is s^2 = 2 r^2, which is what I had before. Therefore, with r = 2^{1/8}, area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4} as before.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a mistake here, the area is 2^{5/4}, so answer is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.\n\nBut let me check with coordinates. Let me compute coordinates of w_0 and w_1.\n\nLet me denote r = 2^{1/8} ≈ 1.0905 (exact value not needed for symbolic calculation). Let me compute the difference between w_1 and w_0:\n\nw_1 - w_0 = r [cos(9π/16) - cos(π/16) + i (sin(9π/16) - sin(π/16))]\n\nThe modulus squared is [cos(9π/16) - cos(π/16)]^2 + [sin(9π/16) - sin(π/16)]^2.\n\nUsing the formula |a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2 Re(a \\overline{b}).\n\nBut since |a| = |b| = r, this becomes 2r^2 - 2 Re(a \\overline{b}).\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n[cos A - cos B]^2 + [sin A - sin B]^2 = 2 - 2 cos(A - B), where A = 9π/16, B = π/16. Therefore, A - B = 8π/16 = π/2. Therefore, this is 2 - 2 cos(π/2) = 2 - 0 = 2. Therefore, |w_1 - w_0|^2 = 2r^2, so |w_1 - w_0| = sqrt(2) r. Therefore, side length is sqrt(2) r, so area is (sqrt(2) r)^2 = 2 r^2. Therefore, same as before. Therefore, the area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, seems correct. Therefore, answer is 11. However, just to be thorough, let me check if maybe the polygon is not a square? For example, maybe after shifting, the square becomes a different quadrilateral? But no, shifting doesn't change the shape, only the position. So if the original four points form a square, then shifting them will still form a square. Therefore, area remains same.\n\nBut maybe my assumption that the four roots form a square is wrong? Let me think. The four roots of w^4 = 1 + i are equally spaced in angle, right? Because when you take roots of a complex number, they are equally spaced around the circle. Since 1 + i is a single complex number, its fourth roots will be four points on a circle, separated by angles of 2π/4 = π/2. Therefore, they form a square. Therefore, yes, they form a square.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{5/4}, which is 2^{5/4} = (2^5)^{1/4} = 32^{1/4}. Therefore, expressed as p^{a/b}, p is 2, a is 5, b is 4. Therefore, a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. Therefore, answer is 11.\n\nBut wait, let me check again with another approach. Let me try to write the original equation as (z + i)^4 = 1 + i, so z = -i + (1 + i)^{1/4}. Let me compute (1 + i)^{1/4} in another way. Maybe convert 1 + i to polar form again. As before, modulus sqrt(2), angle π/4. Therefore, fourth roots have modulus (sqrt(2))^{1/4} = 2^{1/8}, angle π/16 + kπ/2. So same as before. Therefore, same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the square. Let me think about coordinates. Let me take two adjacent points, shift them by -i, and compute coordinates.\n\nLet me take w_0 = 2^{1/8} e^{iπ/16} and w_1 = 2^{1/8} e^{i9π/16}. Then z_0 = w_0 - i, z_1 = w_1 - i. The vector from z_0 to z_1 is w_1 - w_0. The length is sqrt(2) * 2^{1/8} as before. Similarly for other sides. Therefore, the square remains a square with the same side lengths. Therefore, area is same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute coordinates numerically and compute area. Let me try that approximately.\n\nFirst, compute modulus r = 2^{1/8} ≈ e^{(ln 2)/8} ≈ e^{0.0866} ≈ 1.089. Let me take approximate value 1.09.\n\nCompute coordinates of the four points before shifting:\n\nw_0: angle π/16 ≈ 11.25 degrees. cos(π/16) ≈ cos(11.25°) ≈ 0.9808, sin(π/16) ≈ 0.1951. So w_0 ≈ 1.09*(0.9808 + 0.1951i) ≈ 1.07 + 0.213i.\n\nw_1: angle 9π/16 ≈ 101.25 degrees. cos(9π/16) ≈ cos(101.25°) ≈ -0.1951, sin(9π/16) ≈ 0.9808. So w_1 ≈ 1.09*(-0.1951 + 0.9808i) ≈ -0.213 + 1.07i.\n\nw_2: angle 17π/16 ≈ 191.25 degrees. cos(17π/16) ≈ cos(191.25°) ≈ -0.9808, sin(17π/16) ≈ -0.1951. So w_2 ≈ 1.09*(-0.9808 - 0.1951i) ≈ -1.07 - 0.213i.\n\nw_3: angle 25π/16 ≈ 281.25 degrees. cos(25π/16) ≈ cos(281.25°) ≈ 0.1951, sin(25π/16) ≈ -0.9808. So w_3 ≈ 1.09*(0.1951 - 0.9808i) ≈ 0.213 - 1.07i.\n\nNow shift each by -i: subtract i from each.\n\nz_0 ≈ 1.07 + 0.213i - i = 1.07 - 0.787i\n\nz_1 ≈ -0.213 + 1.07i - i = -0.213 + 0.07i\n\nz_2 ≈ -1.07 - 0.213i - i = -1.07 - 1.213i\n\nz_3 ≈ 0.213 - 1.07i - i = 0.213 - 2.07i\n\nNow, plotting these approximate points:\n\nz_0 ≈ (1.07, -0.787)\n\nz_1 ≈ (-0.213, 0.07)\n\nz_2 ≈ (-1.07, -1.213)\n\nz_3 ≈ (0.213, -2.07)\n\nWait, let me check z_3: original w_3 was approx 0.213 - 1.07i, subtract i gives 0.213 - 1.07i - i = 0.213 - 2.07i. Yes, so coordinates (0.213, -2.07). Similarly, z_1 is (-0.213, 0.07). \n\nNow, let me try to compute the area of this quadrilateral. Since it's a square, maybe we can compute the distance between two adjacent points and then compute area.\n\nCompute distance between z_0 and z_1:\n\nz_0 ≈ (1.07, -0.787), z_1 ≈ (-0.213, 0.07)\n\nDifference in x: -0.213 - 1.07 ≈ -1.283\n\nDifference in y: 0.07 - (-0.787) ≈ 0.857\n\nDistance squared: (-1.283)^2 + (0.857)^2 ≈ 1.646 + 0.734 ≈ 2.38. Therefore, distance ≈ sqrt(2.38) ≈ 1.543.\n\nEarlier, we had that the side length should be sqrt(2)*r ≈ 1.414 * 1.09 ≈ 1.539. Which is very close to our approximate calculation. Therefore, that seems to check out.\n\nIf the side length is approx 1.54, then area would be approx (1.54)^2 ≈ 2.37. Let me compute 2^{5/4} ≈ 2^(1.25) ≈ 2 * 2^(0.25) ≈ 2 * 1.189 ≈ 2.378. Which matches the approximate area. Therefore, this numerical example supports our symbolic calculation. Therefore, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates to compute area with shoelace formula. Let me try that with approximate coordinates.\n\nOrder of points: Let's take z_0, z_1, z_2, z_3.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nz_0 ≈ (1.07, -0.787)\n\nz_1 ≈ (-0.213, 0.07)\n\nz_2 ≈ (-1.07, -1.213)\n\nz_3 ≈ (0.213, -2.07)\n\nBut need to make sure they are ordered correctly around the polygon. Let me check the approximate positions:\n\nz_0 is in fourth quadrant (positive x, negative y).\n\nz_1 is in second quadrant (negative x, positive y).\n\nz_2 is in third quadrant (negative x, negative y).\n\nz_3 is in fourth quadrant (positive x, negative y). Wait, z_3 is (0.213, -2.07), so yes, fourth quadrant. But need to order them in cyclic order around the polygon.\n\nBut with the original angles, after shifting, how are they ordered? Let me think.\n\nOriginal angles for w_k were π/16, 9π/16, 17π/16, 25π/16. After shifting down by i, but the angles would have been rotated? Not sure. Maybe better to order them based on their approximate coordinates.\n\nLet me list all points:\n\nz_0 ≈ (1.07, -0.787) – let's call this point A.\n\nz_1 ≈ (-0.213, 0.07) – point B.\n\nz_2 ≈ (-1.07, -1.213) – point C.\n\nz_3 ≈ (0.213, -2.07) – point D.\n\nTo apply shoelace formula, need to order them either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nLooking at approximate positions:\n\nPoint B is upper left (second quadrant).\n\nPoint A is right side, upper middle? Wait, (1.07, -0.787) is actually in fourth quadrant, lower right.\n\nPoint D is (0.213, -2.07), lower middle right.\n\nPoint C is (-1.07, -1.213), lower left.\n\nSo ordering them in counter-clockwise order: Let me imagine the square.\n\nStarting from point B (-0.213, 0.07) upper left, then going to point A (1.07, -0.787) lower right? No, that might not be. Maybe need to figure out the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, since they are supposed to form a square, maybe order them as A, B, C, D or some permutation. Alternatively, let me use the approximate angles of the original points before shifting, then after shifting.\n\nOriginal points before shifting (w_k) had angles π/16, 9π/16, 17π/16, 25π/16. After shifting down by i, which is subtracting (0,1), the angles might have changed, but perhaps the order around the polygon is preserved? For example, starting from w_0, which had angle π/16 (approx 11 degrees), after shifting, z_0 is at (approx) (1.07, -0.787). The angle of z_0 relative to the origin would be arctan(-0.787 / 1.07) ≈ arctan(-0.735) ≈ -36.3 degrees, or 323.7 degrees. Similarly for others.\n\nBut maybe instead of angles, think geometrically. Let me try to order the points:\n\nAssume the square is rotated and shifted. Let me try ordering them as A, B, C, D:\n\nA: (1.07, -0.787)\n\nB: (-0.213, 0.07)\n\nC: (-1.07, -1.213)\n\nD: (0.213, -2.07)\n\nBut need to make sure they are in order. Let me check the vectors between them.\n\nIf we go from A to B to C to D to A, does that make a square?\n\nFrom A(1.07, -0.787) to B(-0.213, 0.07): vector (-1.283, 0.857)\n\nFrom B(-0.213, 0.07) to C(-1.07, -1.213): vector (-0.857, -1.283)\n\nFrom C(-1.07, -1.213) to D(0.213, -2.07): vector (1.283, -0.857)\n\nFrom D(0.213, -2.07) to A(1.07, -0.787): vector (0.857, 1.283)\n\nNow, check if these vectors are perpendicular and of equal length.\n\nFirst vector AB: (-1.283, 0.857). Length squared ≈ 1.646 + 0.734 ≈ 2.38.\n\nSecond vector BC: (-0.857, -1.283). Length squared ≈ 0.734 + 1.646 ≈ 2.38. Same as AB.\n\nThird vector CD: (1.283, -0.857). Same as AB but multiplied by (1, -1), so same length squared 2.38.\n\nFourth vector DA: (0.857, 1.283). Length squared ≈ same as others.\n\nNow check if adjacent vectors are perpendicular. Take AB • BC = (-1.283)(-0.857) + (0.857)(-1.283) ≈ (1.283 * 0.857) - (0.857 * 1.283) = 0. So dot product is zero. Therefore, AB and BC are perpendicular. Similarly, other adjacent vectors should also be perpendicular. Therefore, this is indeed a square with side length sqrt(2.38) ≈ 1.543, and area (sqrt(2.38))² = 2.38, which is approx 2.378 as calculated before. Which matches with 2^{5/4} ≈ 2.378. Therefore, this numerical example confirms our symbolic result. Therefore, the area is indeed 2^{5/4}, so the answer is 11.\n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check if there's another interpretation of the problem. For example, maybe the equation factors differently? Let me check.\n\nOriginal equation: z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0.\n\nWe noticed that it resembles (z + i)^4, which expands to z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z + 1, and then we saw that subtracting 1 + i gives the equation. Therefore, equation is (z + i)^4 = 1 + i. That seems correct. Let me verify with expansion:\n\n(z + i)^4:\n\nFirst, (z + i)^2 = z^2 + 2i z + (i)^2 = z^2 + 2i z - 1.\n\nThen, squaring that: [z^2 + 2i z - 1]^2 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + (2i z)^2 + ... Wait, better to do step by step:\n\n(a + b + c)^2? Wait, no, it's (z^2 + 2i z - 1)^2.\n\nLet me write it as [(z^2 - 1) + 2i z]^2 = (z^2 - 1)^2 + 4i z(z^2 - 1) + (2i z)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(z^2 - 1)^2 = z^4 - 2 z^2 + 1.\n\n4i z(z^2 - 1) = 4i z^3 - 4i z.\n\n(2i z)^2 = 4i^2 z^2 = -4 z^2.\n\nTherefore, adding them all up:\n\nz^4 - 2 z^2 + 1 + 4i z^3 - 4i z -4 z^2 = z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z + 1. Which matches. Therefore, equation is (z + i)^4 - 1 - i = 0, so (z + i)^4 = 1 + i. Correct.\n\nTherefore, no mistake there. Therefore, solutions are indeed as we found.\n\nTherefore, I think confident that the area is 2^{5/4} and answer is 11. However, to check once more, let me recall that 2^{5/4} can be written as 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2 * 2^{1/4}, but the problem says \"expressed in the form p^{a/b}\". So 2^{5/4} is already in that form with p = 2, a = 5, b = 4. Since 2 is prime, and 5 and 4 are coprime. Therefore, yes, answer is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>"}
