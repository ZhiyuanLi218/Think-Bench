The problem gives me the density of states D(ε) = a ε², where a is some constant involving the volume, speed of light, Planck's constant, and a degeneracy factor. Alright, let me start by recalling what a highly degenerate Fermi gas means. \n\nHighly degenerate usually means that the temperature is very low, so the system is at absolute zero temperature, right? In that case, all the lowest available energy states are filled up to the Fermi energy, which would be the chemical potential at T=0. So, maybe I need to calculate the Fermi energy for this system?\n\nBut wait, the question mentions an ultra-relativistic gas. For non-relativistic particles, the energy is ε = p²/(2m), but for ultra-relativistic particles, the energy is ε = pc, since their kinetic energy is much larger than their rest mass energy. So their dispersion relation is linear in momentum, unlike the quadratic case for non-relativistic particles. \n\nGiven that, the density of states D(ε) is given here as a ε². Let me check if that makes sense. Normally, for density of states in 3D, for non-relativistic particles, you get something like D(ε) ~ ε^(1/2). But for relativistic particles, since ε = pc, and the density of states in terms of momentum is proportional to p² dp, so converting to ε would involve substituting p = ε/c and dp = dε/c. Therefore, D(ε) dε would be proportional to (ε²/c²)(dε/c) = ε² dε / c³. Which matches the given form D(ε) = a ε², with a involving 1/c³. So that checks out. So the given D(ε) is correct for ultra-relativistic particles.\n\nNow, since it's a highly degenerate gas, T=0, so the chemical potential μ is equal to the Fermi energy ε_F. Therefore, I need to find ε_F such that the total number of particles N is equal to the integral of the density of states up to ε_F multiplied by the Fermi-Dirac distribution at T=0, which is a step function. So the integral becomes:\n\nN = ∫₀^{ε_F} D(ε) dε\n\nWait, but actually, the number of particles is the integral over all states up to ε_F. Since each state can hold a certain number of particles (depending on spin, etc.), which is accounted for in the degeneracy factor g. The given a is 4πgV/(h³c³). Let me write that down.\n\nGiven D(ε) = a ε², with a = 4πgV/(h³c³). Therefore, the total number of particles N is:\n\nN = ∫₀^{ε_F} D(ε) dε\n\nWait, but hold on. Actually, the number of particles is the integral over all states of the distribution function. At T=0, the distribution function is 1 for ε ≤ μ and 0 otherwise. Since μ = ε_F at T=0, then:\n\nN = ∫₀^{∞} D(ε) f(ε) dε = ∫₀^{μ} D(ε) dε\n\nTherefore, N = ∫₀^{μ} a ε² dε = a ∫₀^{μ} ε² dε = a [ε³/3]₀^{μ} = (a/3) μ³\n\nTherefore, solving for μ:\n\nμ = [3N/a]^{1/3}\n\nBut since a is given as 4πgV/(h³c³), substituting back:\n\nμ = [ 3N / (4πgV/(h³c³)) ) ]^{1/3} = [ 3N h³ c³ / (4πg V) ]^{1/3}\n\nSimplify that expression:\n\nμ = [ (3/(4π)) * (N/V) * h³ c³ / g ]^{1/3}\n\nBut let me check the algebra again. Let me write step by step.\n\nStarting from N = (a/3) μ³ => μ³ = 3N/a => μ = (3N/a)^{1/3}\n\nSince a = 4πgV/(h³c³), so 1/a = h³c³/(4πgV). Therefore:\n\nμ = [ 3N * h³c³ / (4πgV) ]^{1/3}\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nμ = (3/(4π))^{1/3} * (N/V)^{1/3} * (h c)^{1} * (something?)\n\nWait, let me check the exponents:\n\nInside the brackets: [N/V] is multiplied by h³c³/g. Wait, no:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nμ³ = 3N / a = 3N / [4πgV/(h³c³)] = 3N h³c³ / (4πgV)\n\nTherefore, μ³ = (3/(4π)) * (N/V) * h³c³ / g ?\n\nWait, actually:\n\nμ³ = [3/(4πg)] * [N/V] * h³c³\n\nTherefore, taking cube roots:\n\nμ = [3/(4πg)]^{1/3} * [N/V]^{1/3} * h c\n\nBecause h³c³ under cube root is hc. So:\n\nμ = h c [3/(4πg)]^{1/3} (n)^{1/3}, where n = N/V.\n\nBut let me confirm the exponents. Let me write:\n\nμ³ = [3 h³ c³ / (4πg)] * (N/V)\n\nTherefore, μ = [3/(4πg)]^{1/3} h c (N/V)^{1/3}\n\nYes, that looks correct. So μ is proportional to (n)^{1/3}, which is similar to the non-relativistic case where Fermi energy is proportional to n^{2/3}, but here for ultra-relativistic, it's n^{1/3} multiplied by hc instead of ħ²/(2m).\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Let me recall for non-relativistic 3D Fermi gas:\n\nε_F = (ħ²/(2m)) (3π² n)^{2/3}\n\nFor ultra-relativistic, since ε = pc, then:\n\nε_F = c (3π² n)^{1/3} ?\n\nBut here, my expression is μ = h c [3/(4πg)]^{1/3} n^{1/3}\n\nBut there might be differences in the constants depending on how the density of states is defined. For example, in the standard calculation, the number of states in 3D with momentum less than p_F is (V/(h³/2π³)) * (4π p_F³ /3) ) = (8π² V / h³) p_F³ / 3 ?\n\nWait, let me recall. The number of states in 3D with momentum up to p_F is:\n\nVolume in momentum space: (4/3) π p_F³\n\nMultiply by volume in position space V, and divide by h³ (since each state occupies h³ in phase space). Also multiply by the degeneracy factor g (for spin, etc.)\n\nSo total number of states:\n\nN = g * V * (4π p_F³ / 3) / h³\n\nTherefore, solving for p_F:\n\np_F³ = (3 N h³) / (4 π g V)\n\nTherefore, p_F = [ 3 N h³ / (4 π g V) ]^{1/3}\n\nBut for ultra-relativistic particles, ε_F = p_F c, so:\n\nε_F = c [ 3 N h³ / (4 π g V) ]^{1/3} = c [ 3 / (4 π g) ]^{1/3} (N/V)^{1/3} h\n\nWait, but h is Planck's constant, but usually in these formulas we use ħ = h/(2π). Let me check the units here. Wait, in my calculation above, I have:\n\nFrom N = ∫₀^{ε_F} D(ε) dε, and D(ε) is given as a ε², with a = 4 π g V / h³ c³.\n\nSo substituting, N = (a / 3) ε_F³ => ε_F³ = 3N / a = 3N h³ c³ / (4 π g V), so ε_F = [ 3N h³ c³ / (4 π g V) ]^{1/3} = [3/(4 π g)]^{1/3} (N/V)^{1/3} h c.\n\nBut h c has units of energy times length? Wait, h has units of energy × time, c is length/time, so h c has units energy × length. Wait, but here we have h c multiplied by (N/V)^{1/3}... Wait, (N/V) is number per volume, so [N/V]^{1/3} is inverse length. Therefore, h c × [N/V]^{1/3} would be energy × length × inverse length = energy. So that works out.\n\nBut let's compare with the standard expression. Let me do a standard calculation for ultra-relativistic Fermi gas.\n\nIn standard terms, for a relativistic gas, the Fermi momentum p_F is related to the number density by:\n\nN = g * V * ∫ (d³p/(2πħ)^3)) for p ≤ p_F\n\nWhich is N = g V (4π/3) p_F³ / (2π ħ)^3 )\n\nSo N/V = (4 π / 3) g p_F³ / (2 π ħ)^3 ) = (4 π / 3) g p_F³ / (8 π³ ħ³)) = (g / 6 π² ħ³) p_F³\n\nTherefore, p_F³ = (6 π² ħ³ / g) (N/V)\n\nTherefore, p_F = [ (6 π² ħ³ / g) (N/V) ]^{1/3} = ħ [6 π² / g]^{1/3} (N/V)^{1/3}\n\nThen ε_F = p_F c = ħ c [6 π² / g]^{1/3} (N/V)^{1/3}\n\nComparing with my earlier result:\n\nFrom the given D(ε) approach, I have:\n\nμ = ε_F = [3/(4 π g)]^{1/3} h c (N/V)^{1/3}\n\nBut note that h = 2π ħ, so substituting h = 2π ħ:\n\nμ = [3/(4 π g)]^{1/3} (2 π ħ) c [N/V]^{1/3} = 2 π c [3/(4 π g)]^{1/3} ħ [N/V]^{1/3}\n\nLet me compute the constants:\n\nLet me compute [3/(4 π g)]^{1/3} * 2 π:\n\nLet me write 2 π * [3/(4 π g)]^{1/3} = 2 π * 3^{1/3} / (4 π)^{1/3} / g^{1/3} } \n\n= 2 π / (4 π)^{1/3} * 3^{1/3} / g^{1/3}\n\nNote that 4 π = 2² π, so:\n\n= 2 π / (2^{2/3} π^{1/3}) ) * 3^{1/3} / g^{1/3}\n\n= 2^{1 - 2/3} π^{1 - 1/3} * 3^{1/3} / g^{1/3}\n\n= 2^{1/3} π^{2/3} * 3^{1/3} / g^{1/3}\n\n= [ 2 π² * 3 ]^{1/3} / g^{1/3} ?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n2^{1/3} * π^{2/3} * 3^{1/3} = (2 * 3)^{1/3} * π^{2/3} = 6^{1/3} π^{2/3}\n\nTherefore, overall:\n\nμ = 6^{1/3} π^{2/3} ħ c [N/V]^{1/3} / g^{1/3}\n\nBut from the standard calculation, we had:\n\nε_F = ħ c [6 π² / g]^{1/3} [N/V]^{1/3}\n\nLet me compute [6 π² / g]^{1/3}:\n\nThat is 6^{1/3} π^{2/3} / g^{1/3}\n\nWhich matches exactly with the expression I just found! Therefore, both methods agree. Therefore, my initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the chemical potential μ is equal to ε_F, which is given by μ = [3N/a]^{1/3} where a = 4 π g V / h³ c³. Therefore, substituting a:\n\nμ = [ 3N / (4 π g V / h³ c³) ]^{1/3} = [ 3 N h³ c³ / (4 π g V) ]^{1/3}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nμ = \\left( \\frac{3 h^3 c^3}{4 \\pi g} \\cdot \\frac{N}{V} \\right)^{1/3}\n\nAlternatively, since h^3 under cube root becomes h, and c^3 under cube root becomes c:\n\nμ = \\left( \\frac{3}{4 \\pi g} \\right)^{1/3} h c \\left( \\frac{N}{V} \\right)^{1/3}\n\nBut since h = 2πħ, we can also express it in terms of ħ if needed, but the problem didn't specify, so probably leave it in terms of h.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects a particular form. The question says \"determine the chemical potential\", so likely wants an expression in terms of given quantities. Since they gave D(ε) = a ε², and a is defined as 4 π g V / h³ c³, so perhaps expressing μ in terms of N, V, and the constants in a?\n\nAlternatively, if they want it expressed in terms of the number density n = N/V, then μ = [3 a^{-1} N]^{1/3} ?\n\nBut since a is given, probably better to write in terms of the given a. Wait, original expression was μ = [3N/a]^{1/3}\n\nBut since a is given as 4 π g V / h³ c³, so substituting back:\n\nμ = [ 3N / (4 π g V / h³ c³) ]^{1/3} = [ 3 N h³ c³ / (4 π g V) ]^{1/3}\n\nAlternatively, factor out the constants:\n\nμ = \\left( \\frac{3}{4\\pi g} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{h c}{(V/N)^{1/3}} \n\nBut (V/N)^{-1/3} is (N/V)^{1/3}, so:\n\nμ = \\left( \\frac{3}{4\\pi g} \\right)^{1/3} h c \\left( \\frac{N}{V} \\right)^{1/3}\n\nSo that's another way to write it. But unless there's more context or specific form required, this seems acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. For example, using the Fermi-Dirac distribution and integrating... but at T=0, it's straightforward as I did before. So I think my derivation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the chemical potential μ is [3N/a]^{1/3}, which expands to the expression above. Therefore, the answer should be μ equals that cube root expression.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nGiven D(ε) = a ε²,\n\nTotal number of particles N = ∫₀^μ D(ε) dε = ∫₀^μ a ε² dε = (a/3) μ³,\n\nTherefore, solving for μ gives μ = (3N/a)^{1/3}.\n\nSince the problem says \"determine the chemical potential\", and given that a is defined, this is the expression. Therefore, unless they want it expressed in terms of other variables, this is sufficient. But maybe they want it expressed in terms of N, V, etc.?\n\nSince a = 4 π g V / h³ c³, then substituting into μ:\n\nμ = [ 3N / (4 π g V / h³ c³) ]^{1/3} = [ 3 N h³ c³ / (4 π g V) ]^{1/3}\n\nAlternatively, factor out constants:\n\nμ = \\left( \\frac{3}{4\\pi g} \\right)^{1/3} \\cdot h c \\cdot \\left( \\frac{N}{V} \\right)^{1/3}\n\nThis seems like a standard form. For example, comparing to the non-relativistic case where ε_F ∝ (n)^{2/3}, here it's proportional to (n)^{1/3} multiplied by hc instead of ħ²/(2m). \n\nTherefore, unless there's a specific form they want, this expression is correct. Therefore, I think this is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe chemical potential of the ultra-relativistic, highly degenerate Fermi gas is \\boxed{\\mu = \\left( \\dfrac{3 h^3 c^3}{4 \\pi g} \\cdot \\dfrac{N}{V} \\right)^{1/3}}.\n</think>"}
