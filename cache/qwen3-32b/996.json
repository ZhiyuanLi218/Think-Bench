Hmm, let me recall how vector projections work.\n\nThe formula for the projection of a vector v onto another vector u is given by:\n\nproj_u v = (v · u / ||u||²) * u\n\nWhere \"·\" denotes the dot product. In this case, u is the vector (2, 1), and we want this projection to be the zero vector. So, let me write that out.\n\nLet me denote vector v as (x, y). Then, the projection of v onto u is:\n\nproj_u v = [( (x)(2) + (y)(1) ) / (2² + 1²)] * (2, 1)\n\nSimplifying the denominator, 2² + 1² is 4 + 1 = 5. So:\n\nproj_u v = [ (2x + y) / 5 ] * (2, 1)\n\nWe want this projection to be the zero vector, which means both components must be zero. Therefore, the scalar multiplier [ (2x + y) / 5 ] must be zero. Because if that scalar is zero, then multiplying by (2, 1) still gives (0, 0). \n\nSo, setting the scalar equal to zero:\n\n(2x + y)/5 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n2x + y = 0\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is y = -2x + 0, so y = -2x. \n\nWait, let me check if this makes sense. If a vector v lies on the line y = -2x, then it is orthogonal to the vector u = (2, 1). Because the dot product of (2, 1) and any vector (x, -2x) would be 2x + (1)(-2x) = 2x - 2x = 0. So they are orthogonal. And if the projection of v onto u is zero, that means v is orthogonal to u. Therefore, the set of all such vectors v is the line consisting of all vectors orthogonal to u. \n\nSince u is (2, 1), the orthogonal vectors satisfy 2x + y = 0, which is indeed y = -2x. Therefore, the equation of the line is y = -2x. \n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"the set of vectors v\" such that the projection is zero. So vectors v can be represented as points (x, y) in the plane. So the equation they lie on is y = -2x. \n\nWait, but is there a constant term? The equation we derived is 2x + y = 0, which is y = -2x + 0. So b is zero. Therefore, the answer is y = -2x. \n\nLet me test with an example. Suppose v is (1, -2). Then proj_u v would be [ (2*1 + 1*(-2))/5 ]*(2, 1) = [ (2 - 2)/5 ]*(2, 1) = 0*(2,1) = (0, 0). Correct. Similarly, another vector like (2, -4) would also satisfy this. \n\nWhat if I take a vector not on that line? Let's say (1, 0). Then proj_u v would be [2*1 + 1*0]/5*(2,1) = 2/5*(2,1) = (4/5, 2/5), which is not zero. So that works. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The line is y = -2x.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equation of the line is \\boxed{y = -2x}.\n</think>"}
