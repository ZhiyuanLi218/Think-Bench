Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the summation is from n=3 to n=10000 of 1/(n² - 4). Then we multiply that sum by 1000 and find the closest integer. Alright, so maybe I can simplify the term 1/(n² - 4) first. I remember that n² - 4 factors into (n - 2)(n + 2). So maybe partial fractions can help here? Let me try that.\n\nLet me recall partial fraction decomposition. If I have 1/[(n - 2)(n + 2)], I can write it as A/(n - 2) + B/(n + 2). Let me solve for A and B.\n\nSo, 1 = A(n + 2) + B(n - 2). Let me plug in n = -2 to eliminate A. Then, 1 = A(0) + B(-2 - 2) => 1 = B(-4) => B = -1/4. Similarly, plug in n = 2 to eliminate B: 1 = A(2 + 2) + B(0) => 1 = 4A => A = 1/4. So, the decomposition is (1/4)[1/(n - 2) - 1/(n + 2)]. \n\nTherefore, the term 1/(n² - 4) can be written as 1/(4(n - 2)) - 1/(4(n + 2)). That seems helpful because when we take the sum, it might telescope. Let me check.\n\nSo, the sum from n=3 to N of [1/(4(n - 2)) - 1/(4(n + 2))] equals 1/4 times the sum from n=3 to N of [1/(n - 2) - 1/(n + 2)]. Let me write out the terms to see if there's cancellation.\n\nLet me denote the sum S = sum_{n=3}^N [1/(n - 2) - 1/(n + 2)]. Let's write out the terms for S:\n\nFor n=3: 1/(1) - 1/5\n\nn=4: 1/2 - 1/6\n\nn=5: 1/3 - 1/7\n\nn=6: 1/4 - 1/8\n\n...\n\nn=k: 1/(k - 2) - 1/(k + 2)\n\n...\n\nn=N: 1/(N - 2) - 1/(N + 2)\n\nSo, if we add all these terms up, let's see what happens. The positive terms are 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ..., 1/(N - 2). The negative terms are -1/5, -1/6, -1/7, ..., -1/(N + 2). \n\nSo, if I separate the positive and negative parts:\n\nPositive terms: sum_{m=1}^{N - 2} 1/m\n\nNegative terms: - sum_{m=5}^{N + 2} 1/m\n\nTherefore, S = [sum_{m=1}^{N - 2} 1/m] - [sum_{m=5}^{N + 2} 1/m]\n\nLet me adjust indices to see cancellation. Let me write the difference:\n\nThe first sum is from m=1 to m=N-2, and the second sum is from m=5 to m=N+2. So, subtracting the second sum from the first:\n\nThe terms from m=1 to m=N-2 minus the terms from m=5 to m=N+2. So overlapping terms from m=5 to m=N-2 will cancel out. The remaining terms are the terms from m=1 to m=4 in the first sum, and minus the terms from m=N-1 to m=N+2 in the second sum. Wait, let me think again.\n\nActually, when you subtract the two sums:\n\nsum_{m=1}^{A} 1/m - sum_{m=B}^{C} 1/m = [sum_{m=1}^{A} 1/m] - [sum_{m=B}^{C} 1/m]\n\nIf B <= A, then part of the second sum overlaps with the first. So, if I take B=5 and C=N+2, and A=N-2, then the overlapping part is from m=5 to m=N-2. Therefore:\n\nsum_{m=1}^{N - 2} 1/m - sum_{m=5}^{N + 2} 1/m = [sum_{m=1}^{4} 1/m + sum_{m=5}^{N - 2} 1/m] - [sum_{m=5}^{N - 2} 1/m + sum_{m=N - 1}^{N + 2} 1/m] ] = sum_{m=1}^4 1/m - sum_{m=N - 1}^{N + 2} 1/m.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, S equals the sum from m=1 to 4 of 1/m minus the sum from m=N - 1 to N + 2 of 1/m. Therefore, going back to our original expression:\n\nThe total sum S is equal to [1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4] - [1/(N - 1) + 1/N + 1/(N + 1) + 1/(N + 2)].\n\nTherefore, our original sum, which is 1/4 times S, is:\n\n(1/4)[(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) - (1/(N - 1) + 1/N + 1/(N + 1) + 1/(N + 2))]\n\nSo, for our problem, the summation from n=3 to N of 1/(n² - 4) equals that expression. Therefore, if we let N = 10000, then our sum is:\n\n(1/4)[(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) - (1/9999 + 1/10000 + 1/10001 + 1/10002)]\n\nTherefore, once we compute that, multiply by 1000 to get the value we need. Then take the closest integer.\n\nAlright, let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the constant part: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 + 0.5 = 1.5\n\n1.5 + 1/3 ≈ 1.5 + 0.333333... ≈ 1.833333...\n\nThen adding 1/4 = 0.25: 1.833333... + 0.25 ≈ 2.083333...\n\nSo that's 25/12? Let me check:\n\n1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me compute fractions:\n\nCommon denominator is 12:\n\n1 = 12/12, 1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. Adding them up:\n\n12 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 25. So yes, 25/12 ≈ 2.083333...\n\nSo that part is 25/12.\n\nThen the other part is the sum of reciprocals from N - 1 to N + 2 where N = 10000. So N - 1 = 9999, N + 2 = 10002. Therefore, the sum is 1/9999 + 1/10000 + 1/10001 + 1/10002.\n\nSo, we need to compute that sum. Let me note that each of these terms is very small, and since they are subtracted, they will contribute a small negative amount. Let me approximate them.\n\nBut maybe we can compute them numerically? Let me think. Since we need to multiply the entire expression by 1000, and then find the closest integer, we need to be precise enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe approximate them as 4*(1/10000) since each term is roughly 1/10000. But since they are slightly different, maybe we can compute them more accurately.\n\nFirst, let me compute each term:\n\n1/9999 ≈ 1/(10000 - 1) ≈ 1/10000 * 1/(1 - 1/10000) ≈ (1/10000)(1 + 1/10000 + 1/10000² + ...) ≈ 0.0001 + 0.00000001 + ... ≈ approximately 0.000100010001...\n\nSimilarly, 1/10000 = 0.0001\n\n1/10001 ≈ 1/(10000 + 1) ≈ 1/10000 * 1/(1 + 1/10000) ≈ (1/10000)(1 - 1/10000 + 1/10000² - ...) ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000001 + ... ≈ approximately 0.00009999\n\nSimilarly, 1/10002 ≈ approx 0.00009998...\n\nBut maybe instead of using Taylor series approximations, we can compute them numerically with more precision.\n\nAlternatively, note that for large N, 1/(N - 1) + 1/N + 1/(N + 1) + 1/(N + 2) ≈ 4/N - something very small. But since N is 10000, which is large, maybe we can approximate this sum as approximately 4/10000 = 0.0004, but with a slight correction. However, since we need precision to compute the exact value up to maybe four decimal places? Let's see.\n\nBut given that our total sum is multiplied by 1000, so even small differences in the sum can affect the result. Let me think.\n\nLet me compute each term with more precision.\n\nFirst, compute 1/9999:\n\nLet me note that 1/9999 = 0.0001000100010001..., repeating every four decimal places. But for decimal approximation, let's compute it as follows:\n\n1/9999 ≈ 0.000100010001...\n\nSimilarly, 1/10000 = 0.0001 exactly.\n\n1/10001 ≈ Let me compute 1 divided by 10001. Since 1/10000 = 0.0001, so 1/10001 is slightly less. Let me compute:\n\nUsing the approximation 1/(x + ε) ≈ 1/x - ε/x² for small ε.\n\nLet x = 10000, ε = 1. Then 1/(x + ε) ≈ 1/x - ε/x² = 1/10000 - 1/(10000)^2 = 0.0001 - 0.00000001 = 0.00009999.\n\nSimilarly, 1/10002 ≈ 1/(10000 + 2) ≈ 1/10000 - 2/(10000)^2 = 0.0001 - 0.00000002 = 0.00009998.\n\nTherefore, adding them up:\n\n1/9999 ≈ 0.00010001\n\n1/10000 = 0.0001\n\n1/10001 ≈ 0.00009999\n\n1/10002 ≈ 0.00009998\n\nAdding these approximations:\n\n0.00010001 + 0.0001 + 0.00009999 + 0.00009998 ≈ Let's add them step by step:\n\nFirst, 0.00010001 + 0.0001 = 0.00020001\n\nThen, + 0.00009999 = 0.00020001 + 0.00009999 = 0.0003\n\nThen, + 0.00009998 = 0.0003 + 0.00009998 = 0.00039998\n\nSo approximately 0.00039998. However, note that these approximations might have some errors. Let me check with more precise calculations.\n\nAlternatively, note that:\n\nLet me compute 1/9999 + 1/10001. Let me pair them.\n\nSimilarly, 1/9999 + 1/10001 = [10001 + 9999]/[9999*10001] = 20000 / (9999*10001)\n\nSimilarly, 1/10000 + 1/10002 = [10002 + 10000]/[10000*10002] = 20002 / [10000*10002]\n\nBut maybe not helpful. Alternatively, let me compute decimal values with more precision.\n\nAlternatively, use calculator-like approximations.\n\nBut since I need to do this mentally, perhaps accept that the approximate value is very close to 0.0004, with a slight error.\n\nBut let's compute the exact value with more precision.\n\nFirst, 1/9999:\n\nLet me compute 1 divided by 9999. Let me note that 1/9999 = (1/10000) * (1 / (1 - 1/10000)) = (1/10000)*(1 + 1/10000 + 1/10000² + 1/10000³ + ...). So approximately:\n\n≈ 0.0001*(1 + 0.0001 + 0.00000001 + ...) ≈ 0.0001 + 0.00000001 + 0.000000000001 + ... ≈ 0.000100010001...\n\nSo approximately 0.00010001\n\nSimilarly, 1/10001 ≈ 0.00009999 as above.\n\nTherefore, adding 1/9999 + 1/10001 ≈ 0.00010001 + 0.00009999 = 0.0002.\n\nSimilarly, 1/10000 + 1/10002 ≈ 0.0001 + 0.00009998 = 0.00019998.\n\nTherefore, total sum ≈ 0.0002 + 0.00019998 = 0.00039998. So approximately 0.0004 - 0.00000002. So very close to 0.0004.\n\nBut perhaps there is a tiny bit less. Let me check with more precise calculation for each term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps accept that the sum is approximately 0.0004, but let's check how much exactly.\n\nLet me compute each term with more decimal places.\n\nFirst, compute 1/9999:\n\nLet me note that 1/9999 ≈ 0.0001000100010001...\n\nSo up to, say, 8 decimal places: 0.00010001\n\nSimilarly, 1/10000 is exactly 0.0001.\n\n1/10001:\n\nUsing the approximation 1/(10000 + 1) ≈ 1/10000 - 1/(10000)^2 + 1/(10000)^3 - ... ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000001 + 0.000000000001 - ... ≈ 0.00009999.\n\nSimilarly, 1/10002 ≈ 1/10000 - 2/(10000)^2 ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000002 = 0.00009998.\n\nTherefore, adding them up:\n\n0.00010001 (1/9999)\n\n+ 0.0001 (1/10000)\n\n+ 0.00009999 (1/10001)\n\n+ 0.00009998 (1/10002)\n\nTotal:\n\nLet me add them step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.00010001 + 0.0001 = 0.00020001\n\nThen, + 0.00009999 = 0.00020001 + 0.00009999 = 0.0003\n\nThen, + 0.00009998 = 0.0003 + 0.00009998 = 0.00039998\n\nSo total sum ≈ 0.00039998. Therefore, the difference between the constant part and this sum is:\n\n25/12 - 0.00039998 ≈ 2.083333333... - 0.00039998 ≈ 2.08293335...\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 1/4:\n\nTotal sum from n=3 to 10000 of 1/(n² - 4) ≈ (1/4) * 2.08293335 ≈ 0.5207333375...\n\nBut let me do exact fractions for more precision. Wait, maybe I should carry out the exact calculation.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nSum = (1/4)[25/12 - (sum of reciprocals)]\n\nSo, if I can compute the sum of reciprocals accurately, then compute 25/12 - that sum, then multiply by 1/4.\n\nBut since 25/12 is approximately 2.083333333..., and the sum of reciprocals is approximately 0.00039998, which is roughly 0.0004, so 25/12 - 0.0004 ≈ 2.0833333... - 0.0004 ≈ 2.0829333...\n\nMultiply by 1/4: 2.0829333... / 4 ≈ 0.5207333...\n\nBut let me check if the approximation of the sum of reciprocals is accurate enough. Let's try to compute each term with more precision.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the exact decimal values up to more decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, note that:\n\nLet me calculate each term with more precision using a calculator approach.\n\nFirst term: 1/9999.\n\nLet me compute 1 divided by 9999:\n\nWe can note that 1/9999 = 0.0001000100010001..., repeating every four digits. So up to 8 decimal places: 0.00010001.\n\nBut let's compute it more accurately. Let me do long division for 1/9999.\n\nBut that might take time. Alternatively, since 1/9999 ≈ 0.0001 + 0.00000001 + 0.000000000001 + ... So up to 0.000100010001, which is 0.000100010001. So, to 12 decimal places, it's 0.000100010001.\n\nSimilarly, 1/10001. Let me approximate it using the expansion:\n\n1/(10000 + 1) = 1/10000 * 1/(1 + 1/10000) = 1/10000 * [1 - 1/10000 + 1/(10000)^2 - 1/(10000)^3 + ...]\n\nSo:\n\n≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000001 + 0.000000000001 - 0.0000000000000001 + ... ≈ 0.00009999.\n\nSo up to 0.00009999, which is 0.00009999.\n\nSimilarly, 1/10002 ≈ 1/10000 * [1 - 2/10000 + (2)^2/(10000)^2 - ...] ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000002 + 0.000000000004 - ... ≈ 0.00009998.\n\nTherefore, adding them up:\n\n1/9999 ≈ 0.000100010001\n\n1/10000 = 0.0001\n\n1/10001 ≈ 0.00009999\n\n1/10002 ≈ 0.00009998\n\nTotal ≈ 0.00010001 + 0.0001 + 0.00009999 + 0.00009998 = Let's compute decimal by decimal:\n\nAdding 0.00010001 + 0.0001 = 0.00020001\n\nAdding 0.00009999 gives 0.00020001 + 0.00009999 = 0.0003\n\nAdding 0.00009998 gives 0.0003 + 0.00009998 = 0.00039998.\n\nSo, as before. Therefore, the total sum of reciprocals is approximately 0.00039998. Therefore, the difference between 25/12 and this sum is:\n\n25/12 ≈ 2.0833333333...\n\nSubtract 0.00039998:\n\n2.0833333333... - 0.00039998 ≈ 2.0829333533...\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 1/4:\n\nTotal sum ≈ 2.0829333533... / 4 ≈ 0.5207333383...\n\nSo approximately 0.5207333...\n\nNow, we need to compute 1000 times this sum. Let's compute 1000 * 0.5207333... ≈ 520.7333...\n\nTherefore, the integer closest to this value is 521? Wait, 520.733... is between 520 and 521. Since 0.733 is more than 0.5, so the closest integer is 521. However, we need to check if our approximation of the sum is accurate enough. Because if the actual value is slightly higher or lower, it could affect the result.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we need to get a better estimate of the total sum. Let me check the error in our approximation of the sum of reciprocals.\n\nEarlier, we approximated the sum as 0.00039998, but let's check how accurate that is. For example, let's calculate each term with higher precision.\n\nFirst term: 1/9999.\n\nLet me compute 1/9999:\n\nWe can write 1/9999 ≈ 0.0001000100010001... So up to 0.000100010001. Let's take more decimals. Let me compute 1 divided by 9999:\n\nLet me note that 9999 × 0.0001 = 0.9999, so 0.0001 is 1/10000, which is less than 1/9999. The difference between 1/9999 and 1/10000 is 1/(9999×10000). Let me compute that:\n\n1/(9999×10000) = 1/(99990000) ≈ 1.0001×10^{-8} ≈ 0.000000010001. Therefore, 1/9999 ≈ 1/10000 + 1.0001×10^{-8} ≈ 0.0001 + 0.000000010001 ≈ 0.000100010001. So our approximation of 0.00010001 is accurate to 8 decimal places.\n\nSimilarly, 1/10001 ≈ 1/10000 - 1/(10000)^2 + 1/(10000)^3 - ... ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000001 + 0.000000000001 - ... ≈ 0.00009999. Similarly, the difference between 1/10001 and 1/10000 is -1/(10000×10001) ≈ -1/(10000^2) ≈ -0.00000001. Therefore, 1/10001 ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000001 = 0.00009999. Similarly for 1/10002 ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000002 = 0.00009998.\n\nTherefore, the sum of reciprocals is:\n\n1/9999 + 1/10000 + 1/10001 + 1/10002 ≈ (0.0001 + 0.00000001) + 0.0001 + (0.0001 - 0.00000001) + (0.0001 - 0.00000002) = Let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 0.0001 + 0.00000001 = 0.00010001\n\nSecond term: 0.0001\n\nThird term: 0.0001 - 0.00000001 = 0.00009999\n\nFourth term: 0.0001 - 0.00000002 = 0.00009998\n\nAdding them up:\n\n0.00010001 + 0.0001 + 0.00009999 + 0.00009998 = 0.00010001 + 0.0001 is 0.00020001, plus 0.00009999 is 0.0003, plus 0.00009998 is 0.00039998. So that's accurate. Therefore, the error in our approximation is negligible for our purposes because we're dealing with decimal approximations up to 8 decimal places, and when we subtract this from 25/12 ≈ 2.0833333333..., the difference is 2.0833333333... - 0.00039998 ≈ 2.0829333533...\n\nBut let me check if there are higher order terms in the expansion that we neglected. For example, in the approximation of 1/9999, we had 0.0001 + 0.00000001 + ..., but there's also 1/10000^2 + ... which is 0.000000000001, which is negligible. Similarly for the other terms. Therefore, our approximation of the sum of reciprocals is extremely accurate, with an error on the order of 1e-12, which is way smaller than the precision needed here.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with the value of 2.0829333533... divided by 4 gives us approximately 0.5207333383...\n\nMultiplying this by 1000 gives approximately 520.7333383...\n\nTherefore, the closest integer to this value is 521, since 0.733... is closer to 1 than to 0. However, we need to ensure that our approximation of the total sum is accurate enough. Let me check if there are any possible errors in our telescoping sum derivation.\n\nLet me recap the telescoping sum:\n\nWe had the sum from n=3 to N of [1/(n - 2) - 1/(n + 2)] equals [sum_{m=1}^4 1/m - sum_{m=N - 1}^{N + 2} 1/m]. For N=10000, that's correct. Therefore, the expression is correct.\n\nTherefore, the only possible source of error is in approximating the sum of reciprocals. However, as we saw, the error is negligible. Therefore, the value of the total sum is approximately 0.5207333..., and multiplying by 1000 gives approximately 520.7333..., which is approximately 520.73. Therefore, the closest integer is 521.\n\nBut let me check with a more precise calculation. Let me compute the exact value of 25/12 - sum_reciprocal.\n\nFirst, 25/12 is exactly 2.083333333333...\n\nThe sum_reciprocal is approximately 0.00039998. However, let me compute the exact decimal value of the sum_reciprocal with higher precision.\n\nLet me compute each term with more decimal places:\n\nFirst, compute 1/9999:\n\nUsing a calculator (pretending I have one here), 1 divided by 9999 is approximately 0.00010001000100010001...\n\nSo up to 12 decimal places: 0.000100010001\n\nSecond, 1/10000 is exactly 0.000100000000...\n\nThird, 1/10001:\n\nUsing the approximation 1/(10000 + 1) ≈ 0.0000999900009999...\n\nSo up to 12 decimal places: 0.000099990001\n\nFourth, 1/10002:\n\nApproximately 0.000099980002...\n\nSo up to 12 decimal places: 0.000099980002\n\nAdding them up:\n\nLet me write them out with decimals:\n\n1/9999: 0.000100010001\n\n1/10000: 0.000100000000\n\n1/10001: 0.000099990001\n\n1/10002: 0.000099980002\n\nAdding them:\n\nFirst, add 0.000100010001 + 0.000100000000 = 0.000200010001\n\nThen add 0.000099990001: 0.000200010001 + 0.000099990001 = 0.000300000002\n\nThen add 0.000099980002: 0.000300000002 + 0.000099980002 = 0.000399980004\n\nTherefore, the total sum_reciprocal is approximately 0.000399980004.\n\nTherefore, 25/12 - 0.000399980004 ≈ 2.083333333333... - 0.000399980004 ≈ 2.082933353329...\n\nDividing this by 4 gives:\n\n2.082933353329... / 4 ≈ Let's compute 2.082933353329 divided by 4.\n\nFirst, 2 / 4 = 0.5.\n\nThen 0.082933353329 / 4 ≈ 0.020733338332.\n\nTherefore, total ≈ 0.5 + 0.020733338332 ≈ 0.520733338332.\n\nMultiply by 1000: 0.520733338332 * 1000 ≈ 520.733338332.\n\nSo approximately 520.7333. Therefore, the closest integer is 521, since 0.7333 is more than 0.5.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if the actual value is slightly less or more than 520.75, because if it's 520.75 or more, then it rounds up to 521, otherwise to 520. Wait, no, the closest integer to x is 521 if x is in [520.5, 521.5). Since 520.7333 is in that interval, it's definitely closer to 521 than 520.\n\nBut let me check if there's any chance that our approximation of the total sum is underestimated or overestimated, which might shift the decimal.\n\nFor example, if the actual value of the total sum is slightly higher, then multiplying by 1000 would give a slightly higher number, and vice versa.\n\nOur approximation for the sum_reciprocal was 0.000399980004, but let's check if there is any higher-order terms that we neglected in the expansion of 1/9999, 1/10001, 1/10002.\n\nFor example, take 1/9999:\n\nEarlier, we approximated it as 0.0001 + 1/(10000^2) + ..., but actually, the expansion is 1/10000 * [1 + 1/10000 + 1/(10000)^2 + ...], so the exact value is 0.0001 + 0.00000001 + 0.000000000001 + ... So up to the terms we considered, it's 0.000100010001... So if we take more terms, it would be adding 0.0000000000000001, which is negligible. Similarly for the others.\n\nTherefore, our approximation of the sum_reciprocal is accurate to at least 12 decimal places, which is more than sufficient for our purposes. Therefore, the calculation of 520.7333... is accurate.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 1000 gives 520.7333..., so the closest integer is 521.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check once again the exact expression:\n\nTotal sum = (1/4)[25/12 - sum_reciprocal]\n\nBut 25/12 is approximately 2.0833333333...\n\nBut 25/12 is exactly 2 + 1/12 ≈ 2.0833333333...\n\nBut let me compute 25/12 - sum_reciprocal with exact fractions?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because sum_reciprocal is 1/9999 + 1/10000 + 1/10001 + 1/10002, which is a sum of fractions with different denominators. It's complicated to compute exactly, but we have a very accurate decimal approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps bound the sum_reciprocal between two values to ensure that our decimal approximation is accurate enough.\n\nLet me compute upper and lower bounds for the sum_reciprocal.\n\nFirst, note that:\n\nFor each term:\n\n1/9999 < 1/(9999) < 1/(9999 - something). Wait, no, since 9999 is the denominator, we can bound them.\n\nBut perhaps use integral estimates? For example, for decreasing functions, the integral from N to N+1 of 1/x dx < 1/N < integral from N-1 to N of 1/x dx.\n\nBut since we have specific terms, maybe not necessary. Alternatively, note that:\n\nEach term is approximated with an error. For example, for 1/9999, we approximated it as 0.00010001, but actually, it is slightly larger? Wait:\n\nWait, 1/9999 is equal to 0.000100010001..., repeating. So if we take 0.00010001, that is an exact value up to the decimal places we wrote. Similarly, 1/10001 is approximated as 0.00009999, but actually, it is slightly less?\n\nWait, let me think again. For example, 1/10001 is less than 1/10000. Our approximation was 0.00009999, which is exactly 0.0001 - 0.00000001. However, the actual value of 1/10001 is 0.0000999900019998..., so up to more decimals. Therefore, if we approximate it as 0.00009999, we are truncating the decimal, so the actual value is a bit higher. Similarly, 1/10002 is approximated as 0.00009998, but the actual value is 0.000099980002..., so again, truncating gives us a value slightly less than the actual.\n\nTherefore, our approximation of the sum_reciprocal as 0.000399980004 is actually a bit less than the true value because:\n\n- 1/9999 was approximated as 0.00010001, which is exact up to that decimal.\n\n- 1/10000 is exact.\n\n- 1/10001 was approximated as 0.00009999, but the actual value is slightly higher.\n\n- 1/10002 was approximated as 0.00009998, but the actual value is slightly higher.\n\nTherefore, the total sum_reciprocal is actually slightly higher than our approximation. Therefore, when we subtract it from 25/12, the difference is slightly less than our calculated 2.0829333533..., meaning that the total sum is slightly less than 0.5207333... Therefore, multiplying by 1000 would give slightly less than 520.7333...\n\nBut how much less? Let's estimate the error.\n\nLet me compute the difference between the actual sum_reciprocal and our approximation.\n\nFor 1/10001: actual value is approximately 0.000099990001... So our approximation was 0.00009999, so the difference is +0.000000000001...\n\nSimilarly, for 1/10002: actual value is approximately 0.000099980002... Our approximation was 0.00009998, so difference is +0.000000000002...\n\nTherefore, total overestimation in the sum_reciprocal is approximately 0.000000000001 + 0.000000000002 = 0.000000000003.\n\nTherefore, our approximation of the sum_reciprocal is 0.000399980004, but the actual value is approximately 0.000399980004 + 0.000000000003 = 0.000399980007.\n\nTherefore, the difference between 25/12 and the actual sum_reciprocal is 2.0833333333... - 0.000399980007 ≈ 2.0829333533... - 0.000000000003 ≈ 2.0829333533... (negligible difference). Therefore, our previous calculation is still accurate to many decimal places, so the total sum is still approximately 0.5207333..., leading to 520.7333... when multiplied by 1000.\n\nTherefore, the integer closest to this value is 521.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me check with another approach. Let me compute the exact value of the sum from n=3 to N=10000 of 1/(n² - 4) using the telescoping method, and then multiply by 1000.\n\nAs established, the sum is (1/4)[(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) - (1/9999 + 1/10000 + 1/10001 + 1/10002)].\n\nLet me compute this expression more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 25/12 ≈ 2.083333333333333.\n\nNow compute the sum of reciprocals:\n\nLet me compute each term with higher precision using fractions.\n\nBut since that might be complex, let me use decimal approximations with more precision.\n\nCompute 1/9999:\n\nUsing a calculator (pretending I can compute this), 1 divided by 9999 is approximately:\n\nLet me note that 1/10000 = 0.0001, so 1/9999 = 1/(10000 - 1) = (1/10000) * 1/(1 - 1/10000) ≈ 0.0001 * (1 + 1/10000 + 1/(10000)^2 + 1/(10000)^3 + ...). So:\n\n≈ 0.0001 + 0.00000001 + 0.000000000001 + ... ≈ 0.0001000100010001...\n\nSo, up to 16 decimal places, it's 0.0001000100010001.\n\nSimilarly, 1/10001:\n\nAgain, using the expansion:\n\n≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000001 + 0.000000000001 - ... ≈ 0.000099990001...\n\nSimilarly, 1/10002 ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000002 + 0.000000000004 - ... ≈ 0.000099980002...\n\nAdding them up:\n\nLet me write all four terms with 12 decimal places:\n\n1/9999 ≈ 0.000100010001\n\n1/10000 = 0.000100000000\n\n1/10001 ≈ 0.000099990001\n\n1/10002 ≈ 0.000099980002\n\nAdding them:\n\nStart with 0.000100010001 + 0.000100000000 = 0.000200010001\n\nAdd 0.000099990001: 0.000200010001 + 0.000099990001 = 0.000300000002\n\nAdd 0.000099980002: 0.000300000002 + 0.000099980002 = 0.000399980004\n\nSo sum_reciprocal ≈ 0.000399980004.\n\nTherefore, difference is 25/12 - 0.000399980004 ≈ 2.083333333333... - 0.000399980004 ≈ 2.082933353329...\n\nDivide by 4: 2.082933353329... / 4 ≈ 0.520733338332...\n\nMultiply by 1000: 520.733338332...\n\nSo, 520.7333... is the value. The decimal part is 0.7333..., which is 0.7333... = 11/15 ≈ 0.7333. Since 0.7333 is more than 0.5, the closest integer is indeed 521.\n\nBut to be 100% sure, let me check if there is any possibility that the actual value is less than 520.7333... - ε where ε could make it round down.\n\nBut given the precision of our calculations, the error is on the order of 1e-12, which is way smaller than 0.0001, so even if there were some tiny error, it would not affect the decimal up to the third decimal place. Therefore, 520.7333... is accurate to at least four decimal places, so the closest integer is definitely 521.\n\nTherefore, the integer closest to 1000 times the sum is 521.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Maybe compute the sum numerically for smaller N and see the pattern?\n\nFor example, take N=3:\n\nSum from n=3 to 3 of 1/(n² - 4) = 1/(9 - 4) = 1/5 = 0.2\n\nUsing our formula: (1/4)[(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) - (1/(3 - 1) + 1/(3) + 1/(4) + 1/(5))]\n\nWait, hold on. Wait when N=3, the sum is from n=3 to N=3.\n\nWait our general formula is:\n\nSum from n=3 to N of 1/(n² - 4) = (1/4)[(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) - (1/(N - 1) + 1/N + 1/(N + 1) + 1/(N + 2))]\n\nSo for N=3:\n\n(1/4)[(sum 1 to 4) - (sum from N-1=2 to N+2=5)]\n\nsum 1 to 4 is 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nsum from 2 to 5 is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5.\n\nTherefore, difference is [1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4] - [1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5] = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\nMultiply by 1/4: (4/5)(1/4) = 1/5 = 0.2, which matches. So formula works for N=3.\n\nAnother test case: N=4.\n\nSum from n=3 to 4 of 1/(n² - 4) = 1/5 + 1/(16 - 4) = 1/5 + 1/12 ≈ 0.2 + 0.083333... ≈ 0.283333...\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n(1/4)[(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) - (1/(4 - 1) + 1/4 + 1/(4 + 1) + 1/(4 + 2))] = (1/4)[(sum 1-4) - (1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6)]\n\nCompute sum 1-4: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 25/12 ≈ 2.083333...\n\nsum from 3 to 6: 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 ≈ 0.3333 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.1666 ≈ 0.95\n\nExact value:\n\n1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 = (20/60 + 15/60 + 12/60 + 10/60) = 57/60 = 19/20 = 0.95\n\nTherefore, difference: 25/12 - 19/20 = (25*20 - 19*12)/240 = (500 - 228)/240 = 272/240 = 17/15 ≈ 1.1333...\n\nMultiply by 1/4: 17/15 * 1/4 = 17/60 ≈ 0.283333..., which matches the manual calculation. So formula works here.\n\nTherefore, our formula is correct, so our calculation for N=10000 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value is approximately 520.7333..., so closest integer is 521.\n\nBut just to check, let me think if there's another way to approximate the sum.\n\nAlternatively, the sum from n=3 to N of 1/(n² - 4) can be approximated by an integral?\n\nBut since we already have an exact expression, that's unnecessary. However, for large N, the sum from n=3 to N of 1/(n² - 4) ≈ sum_{n=3}^N 1/n². Since n² - 4 ≈ n² for large n. The sum of 1/n² from n=3 to N converges to π²/6 - 1 - 1/4 ≈ 0.3989... But our calculated value is approximately 0.5207, which is higher. Wait, but our exact expression includes the telescoping sum which accounts for the partial fractions, so it's more accurate.\n\nBut regardless, since we already have an exact expression and evaluated it accurately, and arrived at approximately 0.5207, leading to 520.73 when multiplied by 1000, the answer is 521.\n\nTherefore, I think the integer closest to the given expression is 521.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{521}\n</think>"}
