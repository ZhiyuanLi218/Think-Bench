This is characteristic of **beta-minus (β⁻) decay**, in which a **neutron is converted into a proton**, releasing an **electron (β⁻ particle)** and an **antineutrino**. The nuclear transformation is:\n\n$$\nn \\rightarrow p + e^{-} + \\bar{\\nu}_e\n$$\n\nThis results in an increase in atomic number by 1 (since a neutron becomes a proton), while the mass number remains the same.\n\nThus, the missing particle **X** in the decay equation is an **electron**, and the decay equation becomes:\n\n$$\n{ }_{82}^{210} \\mathrm{Pb} \\rightarrow { }_{83}^{210} \\mathrm{Bi} + e^{-}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\n- **Option A: \"The X in the decay equation is an electron\"**  \n  ✅ This is **correct**. As explained, the decay is a beta-minus decay, and the emitted particle is an electron.\n\n- **Option B: \"Increasing the temperature can accelerate the decay of ${ }_{82}^{210} \\mathrm{Pb}$\"**  \n  ❌ **Incorrect**. Radioactive decay is a **first-order nuclear process** governed by the **half-life**, which is **independent of external factors** like temperature or pressure.\n\n- **Option C: \"The mass difference between ${ }_{82}^{210} \\mathrm{Pb}$ and ${ }_{83}^{210} \\mathrm{Bi}$ equals the mass defect of the decay\"**  \n  ❌ **Incorrect**. The mass defect is the **difference between the initial mass and the sum of the final products**, which includes the emitted **electron**. Therefore, the mass difference between the parent and daughter alone does **not** represent the full mass defect.\n\n- **Option D: \"The X in the equation comes from the conversion of a proton to a neutron within ${ }_{82}^{210} \\mathrm{Pb}$\"**  \n  ❌ **Incorrect**. In beta-minus decay, it is a **neutron that converts into a proton**, not the other way around. A proton-to-neutron conversion would occur in **beta-plus (β⁺) decay** or **electron capture**, not in this case.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly **Option A** correctly identifies the emitted particle as an **electron**, consistent with the nature of **beta-minus decay**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. So the problem is about the decay of lead-210 (Pb-210) into bismuth-210 (Bi-210) and identifying the correct statement among the given options. \n\nFirst, let me recall what I know about radioactive decay. The decay equation given is:\n\n82²¹⁰Pb → 83²¹⁰Bi + X\n\nSo, the parent isotope is Pb-210 with atomic number 82, and the daughter isotope is Bi-210 with atomic number 83. The question is about what X is and other related concepts.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the decay equation. The atomic number increases by 1 (from 82 to 83), while the mass number remains the same (210). In radioactive decay, when the atomic number increases by 1 and the mass number stays the same, that typically indicates a beta-minus (β⁻) decay. In beta-minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, emitting an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino. The equation for beta-minus decay is:\n\nn → p + e⁻ + ν̄\n\nSo, in terms of the nucleus, the parent nucleus would emit an electron. Therefore, the decay equation would be:\n\nParent → Daughter + β⁻ (electron) + antineutrino\n\nBut since the antineutrino often isn't included in simplified equations, maybe they just show the electron. So X here is an electron. That would make option A correct? Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A says X is an electron. If that's the case, then A is correct. But let me check the other options as well.\n\nOption B: Increasing temperature can accelerate the decay of Pb-210. I remember that radioactive decay rates are generally not affected by external conditions like temperature, pressure, or chemical environment. The decay constant is a fundamental property of the isotope. So B is incorrect. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: The mass difference between Pb-210 and Bi-210 equals the mass defect of the decay. Hmm. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the original nucleus and the sum of the masses of the products. In this case, the decay products are Bi-210 and the emitted particle X (which is an electron). So the mass difference between Pb-210 and Bi-210 would not be the entire mass defect because you also have to account for the mass of the emitted electron. However, in beta decay, the mass difference is related to the energy released. But wait, the mass of the daughter nucleus plus the emitted particle should be less than the parent. The mass defect is the difference in mass between the parent and the total mass of the products. So if we just take the mass difference between Pb and Bi, we're not including the mass of the emitted electron. Therefore, option C is incorrect. The mass difference between Pb-210 and Bi-210 is not equal to the mass defect because we need to include the mass of the electron (or beta particle). Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: X comes from the conversion of a proton to a neutron within Pb-210. Wait, in beta-minus decay, it's a neutron converting into a proton. The original nucleus has too many neutrons, so a neutron turns into a proton, increasing the atomic number by 1. If a proton were converting to a neutron, that would be beta-plus decay (positron emission) or electron capture. But in this case, since the atomic number increases, it's a neutron turning into a proton. Therefore, D is incorrect because it says \"conversion of a proton to a neutron,\" which is the opposite of what happens in beta-minus decay. So D is wrong.\n\nSo, going back, A is correct because X is an electron (beta particle). Let me just verify once more. If Pb-210 decays into Bi-210, which has one more proton, then the decay must involve a neutron turning into a proton. The emitted particle is an electron (beta-minus). So yes, X is an electron. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possibility. For example, could this be an alpha decay? In alpha decay, the mass number decreases by 4 and atomic number by 2. But here the mass number is the same. So no, it's not alpha decay. It's beta decay. So X is an electron. Therefore, A is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n</think>"}
