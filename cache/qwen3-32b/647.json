So, there are two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. The question is about their luminosities, and we need to find the factor by which the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than Star 2. The options are given as A to D, each with a different factor. Alright, let's start breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2. So, if I denote the radius of Star 2 as R2, then the radius of Star 1 (R1) is 1.5 R2. Similarly, the mass of Star 1 is 1.5 times the mass of Star 2. So, M1 = 1.5 M2. Then, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. From what I remember, Wien's Law relates the wavelength of maximum emission to the temperature of a black body. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since the λ_max are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same? Wait, if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So, T1 = T2. That simplifies things because luminosity depends on radius and temperature.\n\nLuminosity (L) for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are assumed to be black bodies, we can use this. If their temperatures are the same, then the ratio of their luminosities would be (R1² / R2²). But wait, R1 is 1.5 R2, so substituting that in, L1/L2 = (1.5 R2 / R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. So, that would suggest the answer is B, 2.25. But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s for Star 1 and Star 2. Hmm, why is that given? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nRadial velocity is the speed at which an object is moving towards or away from the observer. But how does that affect luminosity? Luminosity is an intrinsic property, independent of motion. Unless there's something else... Wait, maybe it's a binary star system? If the radial velocities are different, maybe they are orbiting each other, and we can use that to find something else. But the question says to compute the luminosity assuming they radiate as black bodies, and they already told us the temperatures are the same because λ_max is the same. Also, the mass ratio is given. Maybe the radial velocities are related to their orbital motion, and perhaps we can find something about their temperatures?\n\nWait, but if the temperatures are determined via Wien's Law from the observed wavelength, then the motion (radial velocity) might cause a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. Oh! That's it. The problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, but if the stars are moving towards or away from us, their spectra would be Doppler shifted. So, the actual λ_max of the star might not be what is observed. However, the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So, perhaps they corrected for the Doppler shift? Or maybe they didn't, and we need to adjust for that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. If it's moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would be shifted. However, the problem says that the astronomers found that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, if there was a Doppler shift, the actual λ_max (rest frame) would be different. But the problem says that the calculated wavelengths are the same. Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the Doppler shift has already been accounted for? Or maybe they didn't, and we need to calculate the actual temperatures considering the Doppler shift?\n\nThis is a crucial point. If the radial velocities are significant, they might affect the observed λ_max. Let me recall the Doppler shift formula. The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the emitted (rest) wavelength λ_rest by:\n\nλ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_radial / c)\n\nBut since the radial velocity is much smaller than the speed of light (c ≈ 3*10^5 km/s, and the radial velocities given are 0 and 700 km/s), we can use the approximation for non-relativistic speeds. The formula for redshift z is z ≈ v_radial / c. Then, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z) ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_radial / c).\n\nBut the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max for both stars are the same. However, if one star is moving, its actual λ_max (rest frame) would be different. Therefore, we need to calculate the actual temperatures of each star, taking into account the Doppler shift due to their radial velocities.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's denote:\n\nFor Star 1: radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s, so no Doppler shift. Therefore, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. And since λ_max1 = λ_rest1, the temperature T1 is given by Wien's Law: λ_max1 = b / T1.\n\nFor Star 2: radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (radial velocity positive if moving away, negative if towards). The observed wavelength λ_obs2 is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest2 by:\n\nλ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nBut the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Therefore, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Since λ_obs1 is just λ_rest1 (because v1=0), we have:\n\nλ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nBut from Wien's Law, λ_rest1 = b / T1 and λ_rest2 = b / T2. Therefore:\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nSimplify, the b cancels out:\n\n1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nTherefore,\n\nT2 = T1 * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nBut wait, if Star 2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So, the rest frame wavelength is shorter. Since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, a shorter rest frame wavelength would mean a higher temperature. Therefore, T2 is higher than T1? Wait, let me check:\n\nIf the observed λ_max for Star 2 is the same as for Star 1, but Star 2 is moving away, then the actual λ_max (rest frame) of Star 2 is shorter (bluer) than the observed one. Therefore, its actual temperature is higher. So T2 > T1. Therefore, when calculating the luminosity, we need to use the actual temperatures, not the observed ones (which are Doppler shifted). Therefore, the temperatures are not the same. So my initial assumption that T1 = T2 was wrong because I didn't consider the Doppler shift. That explains why the radial velocities were given. I need to account for that.\n\nSo, let's redo the analysis with this in mind. Let me write down the equations again.\n\nGiven that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Let me define:\n\nFor Star 1:\n\nλ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since v1 = 0)\n\nFor Star 2:\n\nλ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nTherefore, equating λ_obs1 = λ_obs2:\n\nλ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nFrom Wien's Law:\n\nλ_rest1 = b / T1\n\nλ_rest2 = b / T2\n\nTherefore:\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nCancel b:\n\n1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nTherefore:\n\nT2 = T1 * (1 + v2 / c)\n\nSo T2 is T1 multiplied by (1 + v2 / c). Let's compute the value of (1 + v2 / c). Given that v2 is 700 km/s, and c is approximately 3*10^5 km/s.\n\nSo v2 / c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...\n\nTherefore, 1 + v2 / c ≈ 1.002333...\n\nTherefore, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333...\n\nSo, T2 is slightly higher than T1. Therefore, the temperatures are not the same. Therefore, when calculating luminosity, we need to use their actual temperatures.\n\nNow, luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Therefore, the ratio L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴)\n\nGiven that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1 / R2 = 1.5, so R1² / R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.\n\nAnd T2 = T1 * (1 + v2 / c). Therefore, T1 / T2 = 1 / [1 + v2 / c]. Therefore, T1⁴ / T2⁴ = [1 / (1 + v2 / c)]^4.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity ratio is:\n\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v2 / c)]^4.\n\nNow, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute v2 / c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...\n\nSo 1 + v2 / c ≈ 1.002333...\n\nNow, compute [1 / 1.002333]^4.\n\nLet me compute 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.\n\nSo, 0.99767^4.\n\nTo compute this, perhaps use the approximation for small x: (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - nx when x is small. Here, 0.99767 is approximately 1 - 0.00233. So, x = 0.00233, n = 4. Therefore, the approximation would be 1 - 4*0.00233 ≈ 1 - 0.00932 ≈ 0.99068. However, this is an approximation. Let me check with actual calculation.\n\nAlternatively, compute 0.99767^4.\n\nFirst, compute 0.99767 squared:\n\n(0.99767)^2 ≈ 0.99534.\n\nThen square that again:\n\n(0.99534)^2 ≈ 0.9907.\n\nSo approximately 0.9907. Therefore, the ratio L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275, and 2.25 * 0.0007 ≈ 0.001575, so total ≈ 2.2275 + 0.001575 ≈ 2.229. So approximately 2.23. Which is option C: ~2.23.\n\nBut let me check if my approximation is correct. Maybe I need to calculate more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let's use more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, v2 / c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333333...\n\nSo, 1 + v2 / c = 1.002333333...\n\nTherefore, 1 / (1.002333333...) ≈ Let's compute this division.\n\nLet me write it as 1 / 1.002333... Let me use a calculator-like approach.\n\nLet me approximate 1 / 1.002333. Let me note that 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 1 - 0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 - ... using the Taylor series expansion for 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ + ... for small x.\n\nHere, x = 0.002333.\n\nSo, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 - (0.002333)^3 ≈\n\nFirst, 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667\n\nThen, add x²: (0.002333)^2 ≈ (2.333e-3)^2 ≈ 5.44e-6 ≈ 0.00000544. So, 0.997667 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.99767244\n\nThen subtract x³: (0.002333)^3 ≈ approx 1.27e-8 ≈ 0.0000000127. So negligible. Therefore, 0.99767244 - 0.0000000127 ≈ 0.99767243.\n\nSo, 1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99767243.\n\nTherefore, [1/(1.002333)]^4 = (0.99767243)^4.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, square 0.99767243:\n\nFirst square: (0.99767243)^2 ≈ Let's compute this:\n\nLet me use (a - b)^2 where a=1, b=0.00232757 (since 1 - 0.99767243 ≈ 0.00232757). But maybe easier to just multiply:\n\n0.99767243 * 0.99767243 ≈ Let's compute 0.99767243^2.\n\nLet me note that (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x + x², where x ≈ 0.00232757.\n\nSo, approx 1 - 2*(0.00232757) + (0.00232757)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004655 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995345 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953504.\n\nBut more accurately, let me use decimal multiplication:\n\nLet me take 0.99767243 * 0.99767243.\n\nLet me approximate this as follows:\n\nLet me consider 0.99767243 ≈ 0.9976724.\n\nLet me write it as 1 - 0.0023276.\n\nSo, (1 - 0.0023276)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.0023276) + (0.0023276)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0046552 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995345 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953504.\n\nSo, approximately 0.99535.\n\nNow, square that result to get the fourth power.\n\nSo, (0.99535)^2.\n\nAgain, using the same method:\n\nLet me write 0.99535 ≈ 1 - 0.00465.\n\nSo, (1 - 0.00465)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00465) + (0.00465)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907216.\n\nTherefore, the fourth power of 0.99767243 is approximately 0.99072.\n\nTherefore, [1/(1 + v2/c)]^4 ≈ 0.99072.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity ratio L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 0.99072 ≈ Let me compute that.\n\n2.25 * 0.99072.\n\nFirst, 2 * 0.99072 = 1.98144\n\n0.25 * 0.99072 = 0.24768\n\nAdding together: 1.98144 + 0.24768 = 2.22912.\n\nSo approximately 2.229, which is ~2.23. Therefore, the correct answer is C: ~2.23.\n\nBut let me check if there's another factor I might have missed. For example, is there any consideration about the mass? The problem mentions that the mass of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2. But in our calculation, we didn't use the mass. Why was that given?\n\nWait, maybe there's a different approach where mass is involved? Let me think. The problem mentions radial velocities, which in a binary star system could relate to the orbital velocity. If these stars are in a binary system, their radial velocities could be part of their orbital motion. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about orbital periods or distances, so maybe that's a red herring? Or perhaps the radial velocity is due to their own motion through space (peculiar velocity), not orbital.\n\nBut if they are not in a binary system, then the radial velocities are just their individual motions relative to the observer, and the Doppler shift correction is necessary as we did earlier. Since the problem didn't mention anything about the binary system, but gave masses, maybe the mass is irrelevant here? Unless there's another relation between mass and temperature?\n\nWait, stellar structure equations relate mass and radius and temperature, but if we are told to assume they radiate as black bodies, then we don't need to use the mass-radius relations or anything else. The problem gives mass ratio, but unless there's another aspect, like if they are in a binary and we need to find something else... But since the problem says to compute the luminosity based on black body radiation, and we already accounted for the Doppler shift effect on temperature, maybe the mass is just extra information not needed here. The fact that mass is given might be to test if we get confused and try to use it inappropriately. For example, if someone thought that mass affects temperature via the main sequence relations, but since we are told to use black body radiation and Wien's law, the mass isn't directly relevant here unless there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the radial velocity is connected to the stars' motion in a binary system, allowing us to find the orbital period or something else, but without more data, we can't proceed. Therefore, I think the mass information is just extra, perhaps to mislead or to be used if there was another part of the problem. In this case, since we accounted for the Doppler shift in the wavelength due to the radial velocity, the mass isn't needed here.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23, so the answer is C.\n\nBut let me check if my calculation of the Doppler shift was correct. The formula for the observed wavelength when there's a radial velocity is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )\n\nBut wait, is that the relativistic formula? For non-relativistic speeds, we usually approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c). However, if the velocity is significant, maybe we need to use the exact formula? Wait, the problem says \"radial velocities\", and the given velocities are 700 km/s. Let's check if the approximation holds.\n\nThe exact relativistic formula for redshift is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β) / (1 - β) ), where β = v/c.\n\nBut for small β, this approximates to 1 + β. Let's compute the difference.\n\nGiven β = v/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333.\n\nCompute exact factor: sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )\n\nFirst compute (1 + β) = 1.002333, (1 - β) = 0.9976667.\n\nSo (1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1.002333 / 0.9976667 ≈ Let me compute that division.\n\nDividing 1.002333 by 0.9976667:\n\n≈ (1.002333 / 0.9976667) ≈ 1.00468.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234.\n\nCompare to the approximation 1 + β ≈ 1.00233. The exact relativistic formula gives a factor of approximately 1.00234, whereas the approximation gives 1.00233. The difference is negligible for our purposes here. Therefore, using the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c) is valid, and the error introduced is minimal. Therefore, our previous calculation is still valid.\n\nTherefore, the correction factor for the temperature is indeed approximately 1.00233, leading to the luminosity ratio of approximately 2.23.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: ~2.23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
