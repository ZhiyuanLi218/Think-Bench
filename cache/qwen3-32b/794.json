The options are SF4, PCl5, BF3, and CO2. Hmm, let me start by recalling what asymmetrical means in terms of molecular geometry. I think it refers to molecules that don't have a symmetrical shape, meaning they have a permanent dipole moment because their bond dipoles don't cancel out.\n\nFirst, maybe I should draw the Lewis structures and then determine the molecular geometry for each. Let me start with SF4. Sulfur has 6 valence electrons, and each fluorine has 7. So sulfur tetrafluoride would have S as the central atom. Let me count the total valence electrons: 6 (S) + 4*7 (F) = 6 + 28 = 34 electrons. Wait, when I draw the Lewis structure, sulfur can have expanded octet. So S in the center with four F atoms and one lone pair? Wait, how does that work. Let me think. Each bond is two electrons, so four bonds take 8 electrons, leaving 34 - 8 = 26 electrons. Then, each F has three lone pairs, so 4 F atoms * 3 lone pairs * 2 electrons = 24 electrons. That leaves 26 - 24 = 2 electrons, which is a lone pair on sulfur. So S has four bonding pairs and one lone pair. That would be a seesaw shape, right? Because with five electron domains (four bonding, one lone pair), the molecular geometry is seesaw. And seesaw is asymmetrical. So SF4 is asymmetrical. That might be the answer, but let me check the others.\n\nNext is PCl5. Phosphorus has 5 valence electrons, each Cl has 7. Total valence electrons: 5 + 5*7 = 5 + 35 = 40. Phosphorus in the center with five Cl atoms. Each Cl has three lone pairs. The structure is trigonal bipyramidal. Since all the bonds are the same and there are no lone pairs on the central atom, this should be symmetrical. The bond dipoles would cancel out, making it nonpolar. So PCl5 is symmetrical.\n\nBF3: Boron has 3 valence electrons, each fluorine has 7. Total: 3 + 3*7 = 3 + 21 = 24. Boron is the central atom with three F atoms. Each bond is single, and boron has no lone pairs. The geometry is trigonal planar. All bond angles are 120 degrees. Since it's trigonal planar with identical substituents (F), the molecule is symmetrical. The bond dipoles cancel out, so BF3 is symmetrical.\n\nCO2: Carbon has 4 valence electrons, each oxygen has 6. Total: 4 + 2*6 = 4 + 12 = 16. Carbon is the central atom, connected to two oxygens. The Lewis structure would have double bonds between C and each O. The molecular geometry is linear. Since it's linear and symmetrical on both sides, the bond dipoles cancel out, making CO2 a nonpolar, symmetrical molecule.\n\nSo the only one with an asymmetrical structure is SF4. Let me just confirm the geometries again. SF4 has a lone pair, leading to seesaw shape, which is asymmetrical. The others are all symmetrical: trigonal bipyramidal (PCl5), trigonal planar (BF3), and linear (CO2). So the answer should be A: SF4.\n</think>"}
