Since $ a = 1349 $ and $ U = -405 $:\n\n$$\na + U = 1349 - 405 = \\boxed{944}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to find a unique positive integer $ a $ such that the sum $ U = \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{n^2 - na}{5} \\right\\rfloor $ is between -1000 and 1000. Then, once I find that $ a $, I have to compute $ a + U $. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The floor function here is taking the greatest integer less than or equal to $ \\dfrac{n^2 - na}{5} $. The sum is over $ n $ from 1 to 2023. The challenge is to find the specific $ a $ that makes this sum fall into that narrow range. Since the problem says there's a unique such $ a $, maybe there's some symmetry or specific value where the terms balance out?\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The expression inside the floor function is quadratic in $ n $, so maybe I can analyze the behavior of the quadratic function $ f(n) = \\dfrac{n^2 - an}{5} $. The floor of this function summed over $ n $ from 1 to 2023. \n\nBut since the floor function complicates things, maybe I can first consider the sum without the floor and then adjust for the fractional parts? However, since the floor function can be tricky, perhaps there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rewrite $ f(n) = \\dfrac{n^2 - an}{5} $. Let me note that $ n^2 - an $ is a quadratic in $ n $, which opens upwards. Its minimum occurs at $ n = a/2 $. So depending on the value of $ a $, the quadratic will have different behaviors over the range of $ n $ from 1 to 2023. \n\nBut how does this help? Maybe if I can find $ a $ such that the average value of $ f(n) $ is small enough so that the total sum is between -1000 and 1000? Since the floor function will make each term an integer, the sum $ U $ will be an integer as well. \n\nBut how do I estimate this sum? Let's consider the sum without the floor function first. Let me denote:\n\n$ S = \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} \\dfrac{n^2 - an}{5} = \\dfrac{1}{5} \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} n^2 - a \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} n \\right) $\n\nWe can compute these sums using standard formulas. The sum of squares formula is $ \\sum_{n=1}^N n^2 = \\dfrac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} $, and the sum of the first $ N $ integers is $ \\dfrac{N(N+1)}{2} $. \n\nLet me compute these for $ N = 2023 $:\n\nFirst, compute $ \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} n^2 $:\n\nLet me compute $ N(N+1)(2N + 1)/6 $. Let me denote N = 2023.\n\nBut before I compute exact values, maybe I can express S in terms of N:\n\n$ S = \\dfrac{1}{5} \\left( \\dfrac{N(N+1)(2N + 1)}{6} - a \\cdot \\dfrac{N(N+1)}{2} \\right) $\n\nFactor out $ \\dfrac{N(N+1)}{5} $:\n\n$ S = \\dfrac{N(N+1)}{5} \\left( \\dfrac{2N + 1}{6} - \\dfrac{a}{2} \\right) $\n\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\nLet me write $ \\dfrac{2N + 1}{6} - \\dfrac{a}{2} = \\dfrac{2N + 1 - 3a}{6} $\n\nTherefore, $ S = \\dfrac{N(N+1)}{5} \\cdot \\dfrac{2N + 1 - 3a}{6} = \\dfrac{N(N+1)(2N + 1 - 3a)}{30} $\n\nSo that's the exact value of the sum without the floor function. Now, the actual sum $ U $ is the floor of each term summed up, so $ U $ is less than or equal to $ S $, and greater than $ S - N $, since each floor operation subtracts less than 1 from each term. Therefore, the difference between $ S $ and $ U $ is between 0 and $ N $. \n\nBut since we want $ U $ to be between -1000 and 1000, and $ N = 2023 $, which is much larger than 1000, this suggests that $ S $ must be very close to $ U $, so that even after subtracting up to 2023, it's still within -1000 to 1000. Therefore, $ S $ itself must be in the vicinity of that range. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can set up the equation $ S \\approx 0 $, so that $ U $ is near zero? Let me check.\n\nIf $ S $ is near zero, then $ U $, which is less than $ S $, would be near zero as well. However, depending on the fractional parts, it might be slightly less. But since we need $ U $ to be between -1000 and 1000, maybe we need $ S $ to be in that range plus or minus some amount. \n\nSo let me first find $ a $ such that $ S $ is approximately zero. Let's set $ S = 0 $:\n\n$ \\dfrac{N(N+1)(2N + 1 - 3a)}{30} = 0 $\n\nWhich implies $ 2N + 1 - 3a = 0 \\implies a = \\dfrac{2N + 1}{3} $\n\nGiven that $ N = 2023 $, compute $ a = \\dfrac{2*2023 + 1}{3} = \\dfrac{4047}{3} $. Let me compute that:\n\nDivide 4047 by 3: 3*1349 = 4047. Therefore, 4047 / 3 = 1349. So $ a = 1349 $. \n\nTherefore, if $ a = 1349 $, then $ S = 0 $. But since the actual sum $ U $ is less than or equal to $ S $, then $ U \\leq 0 $. However, depending on the fractional parts, $ U $ could be negative. However, the problem states that $ U $ is strictly between -1000 and 1000. Since $ a $ is unique, maybe $ a = 1349 $ is the value? Let me check.\n\nBut first, let me verify my reasoning. If $ a = 1349 $, then $ S = 0 $, so the actual sum $ U $ is less than or equal to 0. However, how much less?\n\nSince each term in the sum $ \\lfloor \\dfrac{n^2 - a n}{5} \\rfloor $ is less than $ \\dfrac{n^2 - a n}{5} $, but how much less? The difference between the actual term and the floor is less than 1, so the total difference between $ S $ and $ U $ is less than $ N = 2023 $. Therefore, if $ S = 0 $, then $ U $ is between $ -2023 $ and 0. Since the problem wants $ U $ between -1000 and 1000, then if $ a = 1349 $, $ U $ is between -2023 and 0, so it could be in the desired range. But is it?\n\nBut the problem states that there's a unique such $ a $. Maybe $ a = 1349 $ is the correct one? But perhaps there are other values of $ a $ near 1349 that could also make $ S $ close to zero? Let me check.\n\nBut since $ S $ is a linear function of $ a $, increasing $ a $ decreases $ S $. So if $ a $ is slightly more than 1349, $ S $ becomes negative, and if slightly less, $ S $ becomes positive. Therefore, to have $ U $ between -1000 and 1000, maybe $ a $ is around 1349. However, since $ U $ is floor of the terms, which complicates things. But perhaps with $ a = 1349 $, the actual value of $ U $ is between -something and 0, and maybe it's within -1000 and 1000? \n\nBut how do I compute $ U $ for $ a = 1349 $? It seems difficult to compute directly because of the floor functions. However, maybe there's a way to compute the difference between $ S $ and $ U $, which is the sum of the fractional parts subtracted.\n\nLet me denote $ f(n) = \\dfrac{n^2 - a n}{5} $, and $ U = \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} \\lfloor f(n) \\rfloor $. Then, $ \\lfloor f(n) \\rfloor = f(n) - \\{ f(n) \\} $, where $ \\{ x \\} $ is the fractional part of $ x $. Therefore, $ U = S - \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} \\{ f(n) \\} $. Therefore, $ U = S - E $, where $ E = \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} \\{ f(n) \\} $. \n\nSince $ 0 \\leq \\{ f(n) \\} < 1 $, then $ 0 < E < 2023 $, so $ -2023 < U - S < 0 $. Therefore, if $ S = 0 $, then $ -2023 < U < 0 $. But we need $ -1000 < U < 1000 $. Since $ U < 0 $, we need $ -1000 < U < 0 $. Therefore, we need $ E < 1000 $, because $ U = -E $. Wait, if $ S = 0 $, then $ U = -E $, so $ -2023 < U < 0 $. So for $ U $ to be greater than -1000, we need $ -E > -1000 \\implies E < 1000 $. Therefore, the sum of fractional parts $ E < 1000 $. \n\nBut how can we estimate $ E $? Since $ f(n) = \\dfrac{n^2 - a n}{5} $. For $ a = 1349 $, $ f(n) = \\dfrac{n^2 - 1349 n}{5} $. The fractional part of $ f(n) $ depends on $ n^2 - 1349 n $ modulo 5. Let me note that $ n^2 - 1349 n \\equiv n^2 - (1349 \\mod 5) n \\mod 5 $. Let's compute 1349 mod 5. \n\nDivide 1349 by 5: 5*269 = 1345, so 1349 - 1345 = 4. Therefore, 1349 ≡ 4 mod 5. Therefore, $ n^2 - 1349 n ≡ n^2 - 4n \\mod 5 $. Therefore, $ f(n) = \\dfrac{n^2 - 1349 n}{5} = k_n + \\dfrac{(n^2 - 4n) \\mod 5}{5} $, where $ k_n $ is integer. Therefore, the fractional part $ \\{ f(n) \\} = \\dfrac{(n^2 - 4n) \\mod 5}{5} $. \n\nTherefore, $ E = \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} \\dfrac{(n^2 - 4n) \\mod 5}{5} $. Therefore, if I can compute this sum, then I can find $ E $, and then $ U = -E $. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing $ E = \\dfrac{1}{5} \\sum_{n=1}^{2023} [(n^2 - 4n) \\mod 5] $. \n\nSo, to compute this sum, I need to compute the sum of $ (n^2 - 4n) \\mod 5 $ for $ n $ from 1 to 2023. \n\nLet me note that $ n^2 - 4n = n(n - 4) $. Let me consider this modulo 5. Since modulus is periodic with period 5, the expression $ n(n - 4) \\mod 5 $ will repeat every 5 numbers. Therefore, I can compute the sum over one period (n = 1 to 5) and then multiply by the number of complete periods in 2023 terms, then add the remaining terms. \n\nLet me first compute the residues for n from 1 to 5:\n\nFor n = 1:\n\n$ 1*(1 - 4) = 1*(-3) = -3 ≡ 2 mod 5 (since -3 + 5 = 2)\n\nFor n = 2:\n\n2*(2 - 4) = 2*(-2) = -4 ≡ 1 mod 5\n\nFor n = 3:\n\n3*(3 - 4) = 3*(-1) = -3 ≡ 2 mod 5\n\nFor n = 4:\n\n4*(4 - 4) = 4*0 = 0 ≡ 0 mod 5\n\nFor n = 5:\n\n5*(5 - 4) = 5*1 = 5 ≡ 0 mod 5\n\nTherefore, the residues for n from 1 to 5 are [2, 1, 2, 0, 0]. The sum over one period is 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 5.\n\nTherefore, each block of 5 consecutive integers contributes 5 to the total sum. Now, how many complete blocks are there in 2023 terms?\n\nCompute 2023 divided by 5: 2023 ÷ 5 = 404.6, which is 404 complete blocks (each of 5 terms) and a remainder of 2023 - 5*404 = 2023 - 2020 = 3 terms. \n\nTherefore, the total sum over all residues is:\n\nNumber of complete blocks * sum per block + sum of remaining terms.\n\nSum per block is 5, number of blocks is 404, so 404*5 = 2020. \n\nNow, the remaining terms are n = 2021, 2022, 2023. However, since the residues depend only on n mod 5, let me compute n mod 5 for these:\n\nn = 2021: 2021 divided by 5 is 404*5 + 1, so 2021 ≡ 1 mod 5.\n\nSimilarly, n = 2022 ≡ 2 mod 5, and n = 2023 ≡ 3 mod 5.\n\nTherefore, the residues for these remaining terms correspond to n ≡ 1, 2, 3 mod 5, which we already calculated earlier as 2, 1, 2 respectively. Therefore, the sum of the remaining terms is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n\nTherefore, total sum of residues is 2020 + 5 = 2025. Therefore, E = 2025 / 5 = 405. Therefore, since S = 0, U = S - E = 0 - 405 = -405. \n\nTherefore, for a = 1349, U = -405, which is between -1000 and 1000. Therefore, this is the unique a? The problem says there is a unique positive integer a for which U is between -1000 and 1000. So then a = 1349, and U = -405. Therefore, a + U = 1349 + (-405) = 944. \n\nBut before I conclude, I need to check whether there are other values of a near 1349 that might also result in U being within that range. For example, if a is slightly different, maybe a = 1348 or a = 1350, would that also result in U between -1000 and 1000?\n\nLet me check for a = 1348. Let me compute S for a = 1348.\n\nRecall that S = [N(N+1)(2N + 1 - 3a)] / 30. For a = 1348, compute 2N + 1 - 3a:\n\n2*2023 + 1 - 3*1348 = 4046 + 1 - 4044 = 4047 - 4044 = 3. Therefore, S = [2023*2024*3]/30. Let me compute this:\n\nFirst, 2023*2024*3 / 30 = 2023*2024 / 10. Let me compute 2023*2024 / 10. \n\nBut perhaps I don't need the exact value. Since S is positive here (since 2N + 1 - 3a = 3 > 0), and then U is floor terms summed. However, since each term floor(f(n)) is less than f(n), so U < S. But S is positive, so U could be positive or negative? Wait, depends on the actual terms. However, if S is positive, then U could be positive or maybe negative? Let me think. If f(n) is positive for many n, then floor(f(n)) would also be positive. However, if for some n, f(n) is negative, then floor(f(n)) is negative. \n\nBut with a = 1348, which is less than 1349, so 2N + 1 - 3a = 3, so S is positive. Let me check what is the value of S. Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 2023*2024 ≈ 2023^2 ≈ 4,092,529. Divided by 10 is ≈ 409,252.9. Therefore, S ≈ 409,252.9. Then, U is less than that, but since each term's floor subtracts less than 1, U is greater than S - 2023 ≈ 409,252.9 - 2023 ≈ 407,229.9. Therefore, U is a positive number around 400,000, which is way outside the -1000 to 1000 range. Therefore, a = 1348 is too small.\n\nSimilarly, check a = 1350. Compute 2N + 1 - 3a for a = 1350:\n\n2*2023 + 1 - 3*1350 = 4046 + 1 - 4050 = 4047 - 4050 = -3. Therefore, S = [N(N+1)(-3)] / 30 = - [N(N+1)/10]. Let me compute N(N+1)/10 ≈ (2023*2024)/10 ≈ same as before ≈ 409,252.9. Therefore, S ≈ -409,252.9. Then, U is greater than S (since floor terms are greater than S - N). Therefore, U > -409,252.9 - 2023? Wait, no. Wait, earlier we had U = S - E, where E is between 0 and N. Therefore, if S is negative, then U = S - E, so U is more negative than S. Therefore, if S ≈ -409,252.9, then U ≈ -409,252.9 - E, where E is between 0 and 2023. Therefore, U is less than -409,252.9, which is way below -1000. Therefore, a = 1350 is too big.\n\nTherefore, only a = 1349 gives S = 0, and U ≈ -405, which is between -1000 and 1000. Therefore, the unique a is 1349, and U is -405, so a + U = 1349 - 405 = 944. \n\nBut let me verify my calculation of E again. Because earlier, I said that for a = 1349, the fractional parts sum up to 2025 / 5 = 405. Let me confirm that step again.\n\nWe had that for each n, the fractional part of f(n) is [(n² - 4n) mod 5]/5. Then, over 2023 terms, we found that the total sum of (n² - 4n) mod 5 is 2025. Therefore, E = 2025 / 5 = 405. Therefore, U = S - E = 0 - 405 = -405. \n\nBut let me check the calculation of the sum of residues. For each block of 5 numbers, the sum is 5, and there are 404 blocks, giving 404*5 = 2020. Then, the remaining 3 terms (n ≡ 1, 2, 3 mod 5) contribute 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. Therefore, total sum is 2020 + 5 = 2025. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, E = 2025 / 5 = 405. Therefore, U = -405. \n\nTherefore, since -405 is between -1000 and 1000, and other values of a lead to U outside this range, then a = 1349 is indeed the unique value. Therefore, the answer is a + U = 1349 + (-405) = 944. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there could be another a such that S is close to zero, but not exactly zero, and with E adjusted so that U is within -1000 and 1000. For example, suppose a is slightly different from 1349, such that S is small (either positive or negative), and then E adjusts it into the desired range. \n\nFor example, suppose a is 1349 - k or 1349 + k for some small k. Let's check for a = 1348.5, but since a must be integer, maybe nearby integers. However, since a must be integer, and we saw that a = 1348 leads to S ≈ +409,252 and a = 1350 leads to S ≈ -409,252. Therefore, unless there is some a where S is small enough that even after subtracting E or adding E (depending on sign), U is within -1000 and 1000. \n\nBut given the linearity of S with respect to a, the value of S for a near 1349 would be roughly:\n\nLet me denote delta_a = a - 1349. Then, since S was zero when delta_a = 0, what is S when delta_a = delta?\n\nOriginally, S = [N(N+1)(2N + 1 - 3a)] / 30. Let me write 2N + 1 - 3a = 2N + 1 - 3(1349 + delta_a) = (2N + 1 - 3*1349) - 3*delta_a. But 2N + 1 - 3*1349 = 0, as we had earlier. Therefore, S = [N(N+1)/30] * (-3 delta_a). Therefore, S = - [N(N+1)/10] * delta_a. \n\nTherefore, S is proportional to delta_a. For delta_a = -1 (i.e., a = 1348), S = - [N(N+1)/10] * (-1) = [N(N+1)/10] ≈ 409,252.9 as before. For delta_a = +1 (a = 1350), S = - [N(N+1)/10] * 1 ≈ -409,252.9. \n\nTherefore, if we take a delta_a such that |S| < 1000 + something. Since U = S - E or S + something? Wait, earlier when S was positive, U = sum floor(f(n)) which is less than S. But when S is positive, how much can U be?\n\nWait, if S is positive, then U is less than S. But if S is small, say less than 1000, then maybe U is also within -1000 to 1000? But for delta_a negative (a < 1349), S is positive. Let's suppose delta_a is such that S is less than 1000 + N, since U < S. But since S = - [N(N+1)/10] * delta_a. Wait, delta_a = a - 1349. If a < 1349, then delta_a is negative, so S is positive. \n\nLet me suppose that delta_a is negative, so that S is positive. Suppose we want S to be less than 1000 + E, but since E is between 0 and N. Wait, this seems complicated. But given that S increases linearly as a decreases, and for a = 1348, S is already over 400,000, which is way larger than 1000. Therefore, even if delta_a is -1, S is already too big. Therefore, there's no a less than 1349 that would make S small enough for U to be in the range. Similarly for a greater than 1349, S is negative and huge in magnitude. Therefore, only a = 1349 gives S = 0, and U = -405. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1349 + (-405) = 944. \n\nBut to make sure, let me check for a nearby a, say a = 1349. Suppose there was some miscalculation. Let me recheck the computation of E. \n\nWe had that for each n, the fractional part of f(n) is [(n² - 4n) mod 5]/5. Then, the sum over residues (n² - 4n) mod 5 from n=1 to 2023 is 2025, so E = 405. \n\nBut let me check the residues again. For n from 1 to 5, residues are 2,1,2,0,0. Then for each block of 5, sum is 5. Number of blocks is 404, so 404*5 = 2020. Then remaining 3 terms (n=2021, 2022, 2023 correspond to n=1,2,3 mod 5) which have residues 2,1,2. Sum is 5. Total 2025. Therefore, yes, E = 2025 / 5 = 405. \n\nTherefore, U = -405. Therefore, a + U is 1349 - 405 = 944. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 944.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{944}\n</think>"}
