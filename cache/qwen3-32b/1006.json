It is produced by heating limestone (CaCO₃) in a process known as calcination.\n\nHowever, **Ca(OH)₂** is the chemical formula for **calcium hydroxide**, also known as **slaked lime**, which is formed when quicklime (CaO) reacts with water:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CaO} + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ca(OH)}_2\n$$\n\nTherefore, **option A is incorrect** because it incorrectly assigns the formula of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) to quicklime.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Barite — BaSO₄**\n\nBarite is a naturally occurring mineral composed primarily of **barium sulfate**. The correct formula is indeed **BaSO₄**. This is a common mineral and is used in various industrial applications such as weighting agents in drilling fluids.\n\n✅ **Option B is correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Urea — CO(NH₂)₂**\n\nUrea is a well-known organic compound with the chemical formula **CO(NH₂)₂**, also written as **(NH₂)₂CO**. It is a key component in biological systems and is widely used in fertilizers.\n\n✅ **Option C is correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Oxalic Acid — HOOC–COOH**\n\nOxalic acid is a **dicarboxylic acid** with the formula **HOOC–COOH** or **H₂C₂O₄**. It is a strong organic acid and is commonly found in plants like spinach and rhubarb.\n\n✅ **Option D is correct.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{A}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about identifying the incorrect chemical composition among the given options. The options are (A) Quicklime: Ca(OH)₂, (B) Barite: BaSO₄, (C) Urea: CO(NH₂)₂, and (D) Oxalic acid: HOOC-COOH.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these substances is and their correct chemical formulas. Let me go through each one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: Quicklime. I remember that quicklime is calcium oxide. So the formula should be CaO. But here it's given as Ca(OH)₂. Wait, Ca(OH)₂ is calcium hydroxide. Oh right, calcium hydroxide is slaked lime, not quicklime. So that's a mistake. Quicklime is CaO, and when you add water to it, you get slaked lime, which is Ca(OH)₂. So option A is incorrect because it's assigning the formula of calcium hydroxide to quicklime. That's a problem.\n\nOption B: Barite. Barite is a mineral, which I think is mainly barium sulfate. So BaSO₄. That sounds right. Barite is indeed BaSO₄. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: Urea. Urea's formula is CO(NH₂)₂. Let me confirm. Urea is (NH₂)₂CO, which can also be written as CO(NH₂)₂. Yes, that's correct. So option C is correct.\n\nOption D: Oxalic acid. The formula given is HOOC-COOH. Which is the condensed formula for ethanedioic acid. The correct IUPAC name is ethanedioic acid, and its structure is two carboxylic acid groups connected. The formula HOOC-COOH is correct for oxalic acid. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect one is option A. Quicklime is CaO, not Ca(OH)₂. The latter is calcium hydroxide, which is slaked lime. So the answer should be option A.\n</think>"}
