So, the question is about a nuclear reaction where Chadwick bombarded beryllium with alpha particles. The equation given is helium-4 plus beryllium-9 reacting to form some particle X and carbon-12. The options are proton, neutron, electron, or positron.\n\nFirst, I need to remember some basic principles of nuclear reactions. I think in these reactions, the sum of the mass numbers (the top numbers) and the atomic numbers (the bottom numbers) should be conserved on both sides of the equation. That means the total mass numbers before and after the reaction should be equal, and the same goes for the atomic numbers.\n\nLet me write down the given equation:\n\n⁴₂He + ⁹₄Be → X + ¹²₆C\n\nSo, the left side has helium-4 and beryllium-9. The right side has carbon-12 and particle X. Let me calculate the total mass numbers and atomic numbers on the left first.\n\nMass numbers: 4 (from He) + 9 (from Be) = 13.\n\nAtomic numbers: 2 (from He) + 4 (from Be) = 6.\n\nOn the right side, carbon-12 has a mass number of 12 and atomic number 6. Let's denote particle X as having mass number A and atomic number Z. Therefore:\n\nTotal mass number on the right: 12 + A = 13 (from left side). So solving for A: 12 + A = 13 → A = 1.\n\nTotal atomic number on the right: 6 + Z = 6 (from left side). So solving for Z: 6 + Z = 6 → Z = 0.\n\nTherefore, particle X has a mass number of 1 and atomic number of 0. Now I need to figure out which of the options fits this description.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Proton: A proton has a mass number of 1 (since it's part of the nucleus) and atomic number +1 (since it's a proton). So Z would be 1, but we found Z=0. So that doesn't match.\n\nB) Neutron: A neutron has a mass number of 1 and atomic number 0. Because atomic number is the number of protons, and a neutron has no charge. So yes, mass number 1, Z=0. That matches our calculation.\n\nC) Electron: An electron has negligible mass (so mass number 0) and a charge of -1. So atomic number would be -1? Wait, but in nuclear notation, atomic number is the number of protons. Electrons are not part of the nucleus. So in terms of nuclear reactions, electrons usually appear as beta particles. But their mass number is 0, so this doesn't fit since we need A=1. So no.\n\nD) Positron: Similar to an electron but with positive charge. Again, mass number is 0. So same issue as electron. Doesn't fit A=1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B) Neutron.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Chadwick's experiment... I remember that he discovered the neutron through such experiments. Let me recall. He bombarded beryllium with alpha particles and observed neutral radiation, which was later identified as neutrons. Since neutrons have no charge, they were initially hard to detect. So this reaction is classic for neutron discovery. Therefore, X is neutron. Hence, answer B.\n\nJust to check again the math. Left side: mass 4+9=13. Right side: carbon-12 plus X. 12 + 1 = 13. Correct. For atomic numbers: 2+4=6. Carbon has 6, so X must have 0. Which is neutron. Yep, that's right. So definitely B.\n</think>"}
