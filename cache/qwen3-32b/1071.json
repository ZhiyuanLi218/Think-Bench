The chain is stationary, and its plane is parallel to the horizontal plane. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. The cone has a vertex angle α, so if I imagine looking at the cone from the side, the angle at the tip is α. The chain is wrapped around the cone such that its plane is parallel to the horizontal. That probably means the chain is forming a circle around the cone at some height, right?\n\nSince the cone is smooth, there's no friction involved. The chain is homogeneous, so its mass is evenly distributed. The total mass is M. The problem is asking for the tension in every segment of the chain. Because the chain is stationary, the forces must be balanced. So I need to analyze the forces acting on a small segment of the chain.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's consider a small element of the chain. Since the chain is circular, maybe I can consider a small arc of the chain subtending an angle θ at the center. Wait, but maybe it's better to use a differential element. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the radius of the circular path of the chain around the cone as r. But how is this radius related to the cone's geometry? The cone has a vertex angle α. If the chain is at some height h above the base or vertex? Wait, the plane of the chain is parallel to the horizontal plane. So if the cone is oriented with its point down, like a party hat, then the chain is wrapped around it at a certain height, forming a horizontal circle. The radius r of that circle would depend on the slant height of the cone at that position.\n\nBut maybe I need to relate the radius r to the cone's angle α. Let me recall that for a cone with vertex angle α, the half-angle at the vertex (let's call it θ) is α/2. So if we imagine a cross-sectional view through the axis of the cone, we have an isosceles triangle with vertex angle α. The half-angle is θ = α/2. If the chain is at some distance from the apex, then the radius r of the chain's circular path is related to the distance along the cone's surface.\n\nWait, suppose the chain is located at a distance L from the apex along the cone's surface. Then, because of the cone's geometry, the radius r of the circular path would be L * sin θ. Since θ is α/2, then r = L sin(α/2). But I don't know if I need this. Maybe I need to find the radius in terms of other quantities?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I don't need to find r explicitly because it might cancel out later. Let me think about the forces on a small segment of the chain. Since the chain is massless? No, wait, it has mass M. It's homogeneous, so mass per unit length is μ = M / (circumference). Wait, circumference of the circular path is 2πr. So μ = M / (2πr). Is that right? Wait, the chain is draped over the cone, so the length of the chain is equal to the circumference of the circle it's making around the cone. So yes, length of chain is 2πr, so mass per unit length μ = M / (2πr). Okay.\n\nNow, take a small segment of the chain that subtends an angle Δφ at the center of the circle. The length of this segment is Δs = r Δφ. The mass of this segment is Δm = μ Δs = μ r Δφ = (M / 2πr) * r Δφ = M Δφ / (2π). So Δm = (M / 2π) Δφ. That seems okay.\n\nNow, since the chain is in equilibrium, the sum of forces on this segment must be zero. What forces are acting on this segment? The tension forces at both ends of the segment and the gravitational force acting downward.\n\nBut wait, the cone is smooth, so there's no friction. But the chain is in contact with the cone. So does the cone exert a normal force on the chain? Yes, because the chain is lying on the cone. Therefore, each segment of the chain experiences a normal force from the cone. So in addition to tension and gravity, there is a normal force.\n\nSo let me try to draw a free-body diagram for this small segment. The segment has mass Δm, so its weight is Δm g downward. The tension forces at each end of the segment. Since the segment subtends angle Δφ, the tension at one end is T directed tangentially along one side, and at the other end, T directed tangentially on the other side. The angle between these two tension forces is Δφ. Also, there is a normal force from the cone acting on the segment. Since the cone is smooth, the normal force is perpendicular to the surface of the cone.\n\nBut what is the direction of the normal force? The cone's surface at the position of the chain has a certain slope. Since the chain is at a horizontal plane, the normal force at each point on the chain is perpendicular to the cone's surface. Let me think about the orientation of the cone.\n\nIf the cone has a vertex angle α, then its half-angle θ = α/2. The normal force at any point on the cone's surface makes an angle θ with the horizontal. Wait, if the cone's surface is inclined at angle θ from the vertical? Wait, maybe I need to be precise here.\n\nImagine the cone with apex at the bottom. The axis of the cone is vertical. The half-angle at the apex is θ = α/2. So, if you take a cross-section through the axis, you get an isosceles triangle with two sides making angle θ with the axis (which is vertical). Therefore, the surface of the cone is inclined at angle θ from the vertical. Therefore, the normal to the cone's surface at any point is inclined at angle θ from the horizontal? Wait, no. If the surface is inclined at angle θ from the vertical, then the normal would be inclined at angle θ from the horizontal. Because the normal is perpendicular to the surface. So if the surface is θ from vertical, then normal is θ from horizontal. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the normal force on the segment of the chain is directed at angle θ from the horizontal. But since the chain is in a circular path, the normal force direction varies around the circle. However, for a small segment Δφ, we can approximate the normal force as acting at angle θ from the horizontal, directed outward or inward?\n\nWait, the normal force is perpendicular to the cone's surface. Since the cone is sloping outward, the normal force points towards the axis of the cone? Wait, no. If the surface is sloping outward, then the normal force is perpendicular to the surface. Let me think. If you're on the surface of the cone, the normal force points outward, away from the cone's axis? Wait, no. If the cone is like a party hat, with the point down, then the surface slopes upward and outward. The normal force at any point is perpendicular to the surface. So if you imagine a point on the cone's surface, the normal would be pointing outward from the cone's surface. So if the cone is sloping outward, the normal force would have a horizontal component outward and a vertical component upward?\n\nWait, let's consider the direction. If the surface is inclined at angle θ from the vertical, then the normal is inclined at angle θ from the horizontal. Let me draw a coordinate system. Let me take a cross-sectional view of the cone. The axis is vertical. At a point on the cone's surface, the tangent to the cone makes angle θ with the vertical. Therefore, the normal to the surface makes angle θ with the horizontal. If the tangent is sloping outward, then the normal is sloping outward from the vertical axis? Wait, no. If the tangent is sloping outward, the normal would be pointing towards the outside of the cone. Wait, actually, for a cone, the normal vector points radially outward from the axis. Wait, no. If you have a cone with its axis vertical, then at any point on the surface, the normal vector is not radial. Because the cone is a conical surface, not a cylindrical one. The radial direction from the axis is different from the normal direction.\n\nWait, let me think again. For a cylinder, the normal is radial. But for a cone, the normal is at an angle. Let me think in terms of the cross-section. In the cross-sectional view, the cone is represented by two lines making angle θ with the vertical axis. At a point on one of these lines, the normal to the cone's surface is perpendicular to that line. So if the line makes angle θ with the vertical, then the normal makes angle θ with the horizontal? Wait, if the surface is inclined at angle θ from the vertical, then the normal is inclined at angle θ from the horizontal. So if the surface is going up and out, the normal vector points up and out? Wait, no. If the surface is inclined at θ from vertical, then the normal is inclined at θ from horizontal. Let me use trigonometry.\n\nSuppose in the cross-sectional view, the cone's surface has a slope. Let me define θ as the half-angle of the cone, so θ = α/2. Let me take a coordinate system where the vertical axis is z, and horizontal is r. The equation of the cone's surface is z = (cot θ) r. So at any point (r, z) on the cone, the slope dz/dr = cot θ. Therefore, the tangent of the cone's surface at that point has slope cot θ. Therefore, the angle of the tangent with the horizontal is φ where tan φ = cot θ = tan(π/2 - θ). Therefore, φ = π/2 - θ. Therefore, the tangent is inclined at angle φ = π/2 - θ from the horizontal. Therefore, the normal to the surface is perpendicular to this tangent, so it is inclined at angle φ - π/2 = -θ from the horizontal? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nIf the tangent makes angle φ with the horizontal, then the normal makes angle φ + π/2 with the horizontal. Since φ = arctan(cot θ) = arctan(tan(π/2 - θ)) = π/2 - θ. Therefore, the normal makes angle φ + π/2 = π/2 - θ + π/2 = π - θ with the horizontal? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if the tangent is at angle φ from horizontal, then the normal is at angle φ + π/2 from horizontal. But φ = π/2 - θ, so normal is at π/2 - θ + π/2 = π - θ. But π - θ is more than π/2, which would be pointing downward? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I need to visualize. If the cone's surface is sloping outward, then the normal should be pointing outward from the cone. If the slope of the surface is such that in cross-section, it's going up and to the right, then the normal should be pointing to the upper right? Wait, no. If the surface is sloping upward to the right, then the normal would be pointing to the upper left or upper right? Let me recall that the normal vector points towards the inside of the cone. Wait, for a cone, the normal vector points outward from the surface. If the cone is a hollow cone, then the normal points outward, away from the interior. But since the chain is on the outside of the cone, the normal force from the cone on the chain would be pointing outward from the cone's surface.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have a point on the cone's surface, and the cone is solid, then the normal force on the chain would be pointing outward from the cone. If the cone is sloping outward, then outward from the cone's surface would have a horizontal component away from the cone's axis and a vertical component. Wait, but earlier calculations suggested angle π - θ? That must be wrong. Let me recast.\n\nLet me take θ as the half-angle of the cone. So if θ is measured from the vertical axis to the cone's surface. Then, the normal to the cone's surface would be perpendicular to that. So if the surface is at angle θ from vertical, then the normal is at angle θ from horizontal? Wait, yes. If the surface is tilted θ from vertical, then the normal is tilted θ from horizontal. For example, if the surface is vertical (θ = 0), then the normal is horizontal. If the surface is horizontal (θ = 90 degrees), then the normal is vertical. So yes, if the surface is at angle θ from vertical, then the normal is at angle θ from horizontal.\n\nTherefore, the normal force on the chain is directed at angle θ from horizontal. But is it inward or outward? Since the normal force is perpendicular to the surface, pointing outward from the cone's surface. Given that the chain is on the outside of the cone, the normal force would be pushing the chain away from the cone. Wait, but the chain is in contact with the cone, so the cone is exerting a normal force on the chain. If the chain is on the outside, the normal force is directed outward from the cone's surface. However, depending on the orientation, this might have a radial component.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to resolve the normal force into horizontal and vertical components. Since the normal is at angle θ from horizontal, then the normal force N can be split into horizontal component N cos θ and vertical component N sin θ. But I need to figure out the direction. If the normal is pointing outward from the cone's surface, then horizontally, it would be pointing away from the cone's axis? Wait, if the cone's surface is sloping outward, then the outward normal would have a horizontal component away from the axis and a vertical component upwards or downwards?\n\nWait, in the cross-sectional view, if the cone is sloping outward, then the normal vector points outward, which would be away from the cone's axis in the horizontal direction and upwards in the vertical direction? Let me think. If you're on the outside of the cone, the normal vector points away from the cone. If the cone is sloping upward and outward, then the normal vector would have a horizontal component away from the central axis and a vertical component upwards? Wait, no. If you imagine standing on the outside of the cone, the normal force would be perpendicular to the surface. If the cone is sloping upward as you go outward, then the normal would be pointing upward and inward? Wait, this is confusing.\n\nLet me take coordinates. Let me define the cone's axis as the z-axis, and radial direction as r. The cone's surface makes an angle θ with the z-axis. At any point on the cone's surface, the normal vector is perpendicular to the surface. If I'm on the outside of the cone, the normal vector points outward, away from the cone's surface. To figure out the direction, consider that the cone's surface is given by z = r cot θ. The gradient of this surface would give the normal vector. The gradient in cylindrical coordinates would be (∂z/∂r, ∂z/∂z) = (cot θ, 1). Therefore, the normal vector points in the direction (cot θ, -1) if we consider upward z. Wait, the gradient is (cot θ, -1)? Wait, actually, the normal vector to the surface z = r cot θ is in the direction ( -∂z/∂r, 1 ), which would be (-cot θ, 1). Wait, I need to recall that for a surface defined by F(r, z) = z - r cot θ = 0, the gradient ∇F = ( -∂F/∂r, ∂F/∂z ) = ( -(-cot θ), 1 )? Wait, no. In cylindrical coordinates, the gradient is ( ∂F/∂r, (1/r) ∂F/∂φ, ∂F/∂z ). But since F doesn't depend on φ, ∂F/∂φ = 0. So ∇F = ( ∂F/∂r, 0, ∂F/∂z ) = ( -cot θ, 0, 1 ). Therefore, the normal vector is in the direction (-cot θ, 0, 1). Therefore, the normal vector has a radial component inward (-cot θ) and a vertical component upward (1). Therefore, the normal force on the chain is directed inward horizontally and upward vertically. Therefore, the horizontal component is inward towards the cone's axis, and the vertical component is upward.\n\nTherefore, for each segment of the chain, the normal force has horizontal component N cos θ inward and vertical component N sin θ upward? Wait, let me check. The normal vector direction is (-cot θ, 0, 1). Let me find the angle of this vector with respect to the horizontal. The horizontal component is -cot θ (radially inward) and vertical component is 1 upward. The angle φ of the normal vector with respect to the horizontal (radial direction) can be found by tan φ = vertical / horizontal magnitude. Wait, tan φ = (1) / (cot θ) = tan θ. Therefore, φ = θ. Therefore, the normal vector makes angle θ with the horizontal (radial direction). Therefore, if θ is the half-angle of the cone, then the normal force is at angle θ above the radial direction. Wait, but the radial direction is horizontal here? Wait, no. The horizontal direction is radial? If the chain is in a horizontal plane, then the horizontal plane is perpendicular to the vertical axis. At any point on the chain, the radial direction is horizontal, pointing towards the cone's axis. Therefore, the normal force vector has a radial (horizontal) component inward and a vertical component upward, with the angle between the normal vector and the radial direction being θ. Therefore, the normal force can be decomposed into radial component N cos θ inward and vertical component N sin θ upward.\n\nOkay, so for each segment of the chain, there is a normal force N (per unit length?), but actually, for the segment Δφ, there will be a normal force. Wait, but how much is the normal force? Maybe I need to consider the entire free-body diagram for the segment.\n\nSo, going back. The small segment Δφ has mass Δm = (M / 2π) Δφ. The forces on it are:\n\n1. Two tension forces, T at each end, directed tangentially along the chain. Because the segment is small, the tension forces can be considered as vectors at angle Δφ/2 from the tangent at the midpoint of the segment. However, since Δφ is small, we can approximate the net tension force as 2T sin(Δφ/2) directed radially inward. For small Δφ, sin(Δφ/2) ≈ Δφ/2, so the net tension force is approximately T Δφ radially inward.\n\n2. The normal force N acting on the segment. Since the normal force is distributed along the segment? Or is it a single force? Wait, if the segment is in contact with the cone over its entire length, then the normal force would be distributed. However, since we're considering a small segment, maybe we can approximate the total normal force as N acting at the midpoint of the segment, directed at angle θ from the horizontal (radial direction), as discussed earlier. Therefore, decomposed into radial component N cos θ inward and vertical component N sin θ upward.\n\n3. The weight of the segment, which is Δm g downward, i.e., vertical direction.\n\nSince the segment is in equilibrium, the sum of forces in both radial and vertical directions must be zero.\n\nLet me write the equations.\n\nFirst, radial direction (horizontal):\n\nNet radial force = Tension inward - Normal force inward = 0.\n\nSo:\n\nT Δφ - N cos θ = 0 => T Δφ = N cos θ. (1)\n\nSecond, vertical direction:\n\nNet vertical force = Normal force upward - Weight = 0.\n\nSo:\n\nN sin θ - Δm g = 0 => N sin θ = Δm g. (2)\n\nFrom equation (2), N = (Δm g) / sin θ.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\nT Δφ = [ (Δm g) / sin θ ] cos θ => T Δφ = Δm g cot θ.\n\nBut Δm = (M / 2π) Δφ, so:\n\nT Δφ = (M / 2π) Δφ * g cot θ.\n\nCancel Δφ:\n\nT = (M g / 2π) cot θ.\n\nBut θ is α/2, so:\n\nT = (M g / 2π) cot(α/2).\n\nTherefore, the tension T is (M g / 2π) cot(α/2).\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense. If the angle α increases, meaning the cone becomes \"sharper\", cot(α/2) decreases. So tension decreases? If α approaches 0, cot(α/2) approaches infinity, which might make sense because the cone becomes a line, and the chain would need infinite tension to stay in place? Not sure. Alternatively, if α approaches 180 degrees, the cone becomes flat, θ approaches 90 degrees, cot(θ) approaches zero, so tension approaches zero, which makes sense because if the cone is flat (like a flat plane), the chain would just lie on it with no tension needed? Wait, but if it's a flat plane, the chain would be a circle on the plane. However, if there's gravity, the chain would need tension to support its own weight? Wait, no. If the plane is horizontal, then the normal force from the plane would support the weight, and there would be no tension. So yes, if α approaches 180°, the tension goes to zero, which matches. So that seems reasonable.\n\nAnother check: if the cone is a vertical cylinder, θ = 90°, but wait, a cylinder isn't a cone. A cylinder would correspond to α = 180°, same as above. If we have a cone with α = 90°, then θ = 45°, so cot(θ) = 1. So T = Mg / 2π. Is that correct? Let's imagine a cone with α = 90°, so a cone where the half-angle is 45°, so it's a fairly steep cone. The chain is wrapped around it. The tension is Mg / 2π. If instead, the chain was hanging in a horizontal circle supported by tension only (like a rotating chain), but in this case, it's supported by both the normal force and tension. But since the cone is providing a normal force, the tension is less than if it were, say, a rotating chain where tension provides the centripetal force. So maybe that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of another approach. The entire chain is in equilibrium. The total gravitational force on the chain is Mg downward. The normal force from the cone must balance this. From equation (2), for each segment, N sin θ = Δm g. Integrating over the entire chain, total N sin θ = Mg. But since the chain is symmetric, the total normal force's horizontal components cancel out, and the vertical components add up. However, each segment's N contributes N sin θ upward. Therefore, total N sin θ over all segments equals Mg. From our previous result, N = Δm g / sin θ. Therefore, total N sin θ = total Δm g = Mg, which checks out. So that's consistent.\n\nAlso, from equation (1), T Δφ = N cos θ. Integrating around the entire chain, sum T Δφ = total N cos θ. But the left side is sum T Δφ. However, T is constant, so sum T Δφ = T * sum Δφ = T * 2π. The right side is total N cos θ. From N = Δm g / sin θ, total N cos θ = total Δm g cot θ = Mg cot θ. Therefore, T * 2π = Mg cot θ => T = Mg cot θ / 2π. Which is the same as before. Therefore, this method also gives the same result. So that seems to confirm the answer.\n\nTherefore, the tension T is (Mg / 2π) cot(α/2).\n\nBut let me write θ as α/2. So T = (Mg / 2π) cot(α/2). Alternatively, cot(α/2) can be expressed in terms of cos and sin: cot(α/2) = cos(α/2)/sin(α/2). Also, there are trigonometric identities that could express this differently, but unless the question expects a different form, this should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, using cot(α/2) = (1 + cos α)/sin α, from the double-angle formulas. Let me recall:\n\ncot(θ/2) = (1 + cos θ)/sin θ. So if θ = α, then cot(α/2) = (1 + cos α)/sin α. Therefore, T can also be written as Mg / 2π * (1 + cos α)/sin α = Mg (1 + cos α) / (2π sin α). But whether this is simpler is debatable. The question might prefer one form over the other, but unless specified, both are correct. However, since the problem mentions the vertex angle α, and we derived it in terms of cot(α/2), probably best to leave it as T = (Mg / 2π) cot(α/2).\n\nWait, but let me check units. Tension should have units of force, which Mg is, divided by 2π is unitless, cot is unitless, so yes, units are correct.\n\nAnother sanity check: if the chain were on a horizontal cylinder (which would be a cone with α = π/2? No, a cylinder isn't a cone. A cylinder can be thought of as a cone with α approaching 180°, as I thought earlier. But maybe another way. If we imagine a cone with α approaching 180°, then cot(α/2) approaches cot(π) which is undefined, but approaching from below, α approaching π, cot(α/2) approaches cot(π/2) = 0. Which again gives T approaching zero, as before. So that still makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the cone were very \"sharp\", α approaching 0, then cot(α/2) approaches infinity, implying that the tension needed is very high. Which might make sense because if the cone is very sharp, the normal force's vertical component must support the weight, but since the angle θ = α/2 is very small, sin θ is small, so N must be very large to have N sin θ = Mg. Then, from T = N cos θ, since N is large and cos θ approaches 1, T approaches (Mg / sin θ) * 1, which as θ approaches 0, T approaches infinity. So that seems consistent. So the formula seems to behave correctly in limiting cases.\n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct answer: T = (M g / 2π) cot(α/2).\n\nBut let me check if there is another approach or if I missed something. For example, considering the entire chain and using symmetry.\n\nThe entire chain is circular. Let me imagine cutting the chain and considering the tension T. Since it's a circle, every point is symmetric. The tension is uniform throughout because the chain is homogeneous and the cone is symmetric.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the tension provides the centripetal force? Wait, no, because the chain is stationary. There is no centripetal acceleration. Instead, the horizontal component of the normal force and the tension must balance to provide equilibrium.\n\nWait, earlier we considered for a segment that the net radial force is zero: tension inward equals normal force inward. But since the chain is stationary, there is no centripetal acceleration, so indeed the net radial force on each segment is zero.\n\nTherefore, the previous analysis holds.\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire chain. The weight of the chain is Mg downward. The vertical component of the normal force must balance this. The normal force per unit length has a vertical component. However, integrating around the circle, the horizontal components of the normal force cancel out, and the vertical components add up. As we saw before, total N sin θ = Mg. Also, considering the tension, around the whole chain, the tension is tangential. If we consider the entire chain, the tension is uniform and tangential at every point. If we imagine cutting the chain, the tension on both sides would cancel. Therefore, not much to get from that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the chain as a loop. The tension in a loop under gravity... but in this case, the gravity is balanced by the normal force. So the tension is only due to the requirement of balancing the horizontal component of the normal force. Which we already considered.\n\nTherefore, I think my derivation is correct. So the answer is T equals (Mg divided by 2π) multiplied by cotangent of half the vertex angle α.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe tension in every segment of the chain is \\boxed{\\dfrac{Mg}{2\\pi} \\cot\\left(\\dfrac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}.\n</think>"}
