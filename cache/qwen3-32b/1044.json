The question says that two systems, A and B, have the same strain amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves, and we need to find the ratio DA/DB. The options are given, so I need to work through the physics here.\n\nFirst, I remember that the strain amplitude h of gravitational waves from a binary system depends on several factors. The formula for the strain amplitude might involve the masses of the black holes, their orbital frequency, and the distance to the system. But I need to recall the exact relationship.\n\nI think the formula for the strain amplitude h is something like h ∝ (G M c^{-2}) / (d L), where M is the chirp mass, d is the distance, and L is some characteristic length scale related to the orbital separation. Wait, maybe I need to be more precise here. Let me try to recall the standard formula for gravitational wave strain from a binary system.\n\nThe strain amplitude h is given by:\n\nh ≈ (4 G^{1/2} M^{5/3} f^{2/3}) / (c^4 d)\n\nWait, no, maybe I need to think about the quadrupole formula or the chirp mass. Another approach: The strain amplitude from a binary system is often approximated by:\n\nh ≈ (4 G^{1/2} (M_c) / (c^2 d)) (π f / c)^{2/3}\n\nWhere M_c is the chirp mass. The chirp mass M_c is defined as:\n\nM_c = (m1 m2)^{3/5} / (m1 + m2)^{1/5}\n\nSo if the strain amplitude h is the same for both systems, then the ratio of their distances would be determined by the ratio of their chirp masses and frequencies. However, the problem states that the strain amplitude and frequency are the same for both systems. Wait, so both h and f are the same for A and B? So, if h_A = h_B and f_A = f_B, then how does that affect the distance?\n\nLet me write the formula again. Let me check a textbook or my notes... Hmm, assuming I can't look it up, I need to derive it. The strain amplitude from a binary system depends on the quadrupole moment, which relates to the masses and their orbital separation. The gravitational wave frequency is related to the orbital frequency, which in turn depends on the masses and orbital separation via Kepler's law.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for the strain amplitude h is:\n\nh ≈ (4 G^{1/2} M_c^{5/3} π^{2/3} f^{2/3}) / (c^{4} d)\n\nSo if h is the same for both systems, then:\n\nh_A / h_B = [M_cA^{5/3} / d_A] / [M_cB^{5/3} / d_B] ] = 1\n\nBecause h_A = h_B and f_A = f_B, so the frequencies cancel out. Therefore,\n\n[M_cA^{5/3} / d_A] = [M_cB^{5/3} / d_B]\n\nTherefore, d_A / d_B = (M_cA / M_cB)^{5/3}\n\nWait, solving for d_A/d_B:\n\nd_A / d_B = (M_cA / M_cB)^{5/3}\n\nBut since h is inversely proportional to distance and directly proportional to M_c^{5/3}, so if h is same, then d ∝ M_c^{5/3}. Therefore, DA/DB = (M_cA / M_cB)^{5/3}\n\nSo first I need to compute the chirp mass for both systems A and B.\n\nFor system A: m1 = 10 solar masses, m2 = 25 solar masses.\n\nChirp mass M_cA = (m1 m2)^{3/5} / (m1 + m2)^{1/5}\n\nSimilarly for system B: m1 = 35, m2 = 50.\n\nSo let's compute M_cA and M_cB.\n\nFirst, compute M_cA:\n\nm1 * m2 = 10 * 25 = 250\n\nm1 + m2 = 35\n\nSo M_cA = (250)^{3/5} / (35)^{1/5}\n\nSimilarly for M_cB:\n\nm1 * m2 = 35 * 50 = 1750\n\nm1 + m2 = 85\n\nSo M_cB = (1750)^{3/5} / (85)^{1/5}\n\nBut how do I compute these exponents? Maybe take logarithms or find a way to express them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the ratio M_cA / M_cB.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nM_cA / M_cB = [ (250^3 / 35) ]^{1/5} / [ (1750^3 / 85) ]^{1/5} } ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, M_c = (m1 m2)^{3/5} / (m1 + m2)^{1/5} = [ (m1 m2)^3 / (m1 + m2) ]^{1/5}\n\nYes, because (m1 m2)^{3/5} divided by (m1 + m2)^{1/5} is equal to [ (m1 m2)^3 / (m1 + m2) ]^{1/5}.\n\nTherefore, the ratio M_cA / M_cB is [ ( (m1A m2A)^3 / (mA_total) ) / ( (m1B m2B)^3 / (mB_total) ) ]^{1/5}\n\nSo:\n\nM_cA / M_cB = [ ( (m1A m2A)^3 / (mA_total) ) / ( (m1B m2B)^3 / (mB_total) ) ]^{1/5}\n\nTherefore, let's compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFor system A:\n\nm1A m2A = 10 * 25 = 250\n\nmA_total = 10 + 25 = 35\n\nSo numerator part for A: (250^3)/35\n\nFor system B:\n\nm1B m2B = 35 * 50 = 1750\n\nmB_total = 35 + 50 = 85\n\nDenominator part for B: (1750^3)/85\n\nTherefore, the ratio inside the brackets is:\n\n[ (250^3 / 35) / (1750^3 / 85) ] = [ (250^3 * 85) / (1750^3 * 35) ]\n\nSimplify this expression.\n\nFirst, note that 1750 is 7*250? Let me check:\n\n250 * 7 = 1750. Yes! Because 250 * 7 = 1750.\n\nSo 1750 = 7 * 250. Therefore, 1750^3 = 7^3 * 250^3.\n\nTherefore, substituting that into the ratio:\n\n[ (250^3 * 85) / (7^3 * 250^3 * 35) ) ] = [ 85 / (7^3 * 35) ) ]\n\nThe 250^3 cancels out.\n\nSo simplifying:\n\n85 / (343 * 35)\n\nCalculate denominator: 343 * 35. Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 343 * 35 = 343 * (30 + 5) = 343*30 + 343*5 = 10290 + 1715 = 12005\n\nSo the ratio is 85 / 12005.\n\nSimplify 85 / 12005. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 5: 17 / 2401.\n\n2401 is 7^4, since 7^2=49, 7^3=343, 7^4=2401. Yes.\n\nSo the ratio is 17 / 2401 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 2401 divided by 17. Let me compute 17 * 141 = 2397. So 17 / 2401 ≈ 1 / (2401 / 17) ≈ 1 / 141.235 ≈ 0.00708.\n\nSo the ratio inside the brackets is approximately 0.00708. Then we take the 1/5 power of that, because the entire ratio M_cA / M_cB is [this value]^{1/5}.\n\nSo let me compute (0.00708)^{1/5}.\n\nHmm. Let me think. The fifth root of 0.00708. Let me note that 0.00708 is approximately 7.08 x 10^{-3}.\n\nI know that 10^{-3} is (10^{-0.6})^5 because 10^{-0.6*5} = 10^{-3}. Wait, 10^{-0.6} ≈ 0.251. Because log10(0.25) ≈ -0.6. So fifth root of 10^{-3} is 10^{-0.6} ≈ 0.251.\n\nBut our number is 7.08 x 10^{-3}, which is about 7 times larger than 10^{-3}. So let's see, if x^5 = 7.08 x 10^{-3}, then x ≈ ?\n\nLet me take natural logarithm. Let me compute ln(7.08 x 10^{-3}) = ln(7.08) + ln(10^{-3}) ≈ 1.958 - 6.908 = -4.95. Then divide by 5: -0.99. Then exponentiate: e^{-0.99} ≈ 0.371.\n\nSo approximately 0.37. Therefore, the ratio M_cA / M_cB ≈ 0.37. Therefore, DA/DB = (M_cA / M_cB)^{5/3} ?\n\nWait no, earlier we had DA / DB = (M_cA / M_cB)^{5/3}? Wait, let me check again.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nFrom h_A / h_B = 1 = [M_cA^{5/3} / d_A] / [M_cB^{5/3} / d_B] ]\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\nd_A / d_B = (M_cA / M_cB)^{5/3}\n\nYes. Because cross-multiplying:\n\nM_cA^{5/3} / d_A = M_cB^{5/3} / d_B\n\nTherefore,\n\nd_A / d_B = (M_cA / M_cB)^{5/3}\n\nEarlier, we found that M_cA / M_cB ≈ 0.37. Therefore, DA / DB = (0.37)^{5/3}\n\nLet me compute that. Let me first compute 0.37^{1/3} and then raise to the 5th power? Or compute exponents step by step.\n\nAlternatively, take natural logs:\n\nln(0.37) ≈ -1. Let me check. ln(0.37) ≈ -1. Let me compute:\n\ne^{-1} ≈ 0.3679. Oh! So ln(0.37) ≈ -1.0 + (0.37 - 0.3679)/0.3679 ≈ roughly -1.0 + 0.0057 ≈ -0.9943? Wait, no, that approach isn't correct. Let me just recall that ln(0.37) ≈ -1.0. Because e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679 ≈ 0.37. So ln(0.37) ≈ -1.0. Therefore, ln(DA/DB) = (5/3) * ln(M_cA / M_cB) ≈ (5/3)*(-1.0) ≈ -1.6667. Then exponentiating:\n\nDA/DB ≈ e^{-1.6667} ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^{-1.6} ≈ 0.2019, e^{-1.7} ≈ 0.1827. Let me interpolate between these values.\n\n-1.6667 is approximately -1.6667, which is -1.6 - 0.0667. Let me compute e^{-1.6667} ≈ e^{-1.6} * e^{-0.0667} ≈ 0.2019 * e^{-0.0667}.\n\nCompute e^{-0.0667} ≈ 1 - 0.0667 + ... ≈ approximately 0.9355 (since e^{-x} ≈ 1 - x for small x, but more accurately, using calculator-like approach: ln(0.935) ≈ -0.067. So e^{-0.0667} ≈ 0.9355. Therefore, 0.2019 * 0.9355 ≈ 0.2019 * 0.935 ≈ approx 0.1887.\n\nAlternatively, since -1.6667 is -5/3 ≈ -1.6667. So e^{-5/3} ≈ ?\n\nBut since ln(0.37) ≈ -1.0, so if M_cA/M_cB ≈ e^{-1.0}, then DA/DB ≈ e^{-5/3} ≈ e^{-1.6667} ≈ 0.188. Which is approximately 0.19. Looking at the options, option D is ~0.19. But wait, the answer choices are:\n\nA: ~0.38\n\nB: ~0.56\n\nC: ~0.28\n\nD: ~0.19\n\nSo according to this rough calculation, DA/DB ≈ 0.19, which is option D.\n\nBut let me check my approximations again. Because earlier I approximated M_cA / M_cB as 0.37, which was based on an approximate calculation. Let me try to compute that more accurately.\n\nWe had the ratio inside the brackets for M_cA / M_cB was 17 / 2401 ≈ 0.00708. Then taking the 1/5 power. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.00708^(1/5). Let me take logarithms again. Let me use base 10 logs for easier calculation.\n\nlog10(0.00708) = log10(7.08 × 10^-3) = log10(7.08) + (-3) ≈ 0.85 - 3 = -2.15. Wait, log10(7.08) is approx 0.85 because log10(7) ≈ 0.8451 and log10(8)=0.9031. So 7.08 is about 0.85. So log10(0.00708) ≈ -2.15. Therefore, log10(M_cA / M_cB) = (1/5) * (-2.15) = -0.43. Therefore, M_cA / M_cB ≈ 10^{-0.43}.\n\nWhat is 10^{-0.43}? Well, 10^{-0.43} = 1 / 10^{0.43}. 10^{0.43} ≈ 10^{0.4} * 10^{0.03} ≈ 2.5119 * 1.071 ≈ 2.5119 * 1.07 ≈ approx 2.688. Therefore, 1 / 2.688 ≈ 0.372. So M_cA / M_cB ≈ 0.372. Then DA/DB = (0.372)^{5/3}.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately. Let me take natural logs again. Let me compute ln(0.372) ≈ ?\n\nWe know that ln(0.3679) = -1.0, as that's e^{-1}. 0.372 is slightly larger than 0.3679. The difference is 0.372 - 0.3679 = 0.0041. The derivative of ln(x) at x=0.3679 is 1/x ≈ 2.72. So approximate ln(0.372) ≈ ln(0.3679) + 0.0041 * 2.72 ≈ -1.0 + 0.0111 ≈ -0.9889.\n\nTherefore, ln(DA/DB) = (5/3) * ln(M_cA / M_cB) ≈ (5/3) * (-0.9889) ≈ -1.648. Then exponentiating:\n\nDA/DB ≈ e^{-1.648} ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^{-1.6} ≈ 0.2019, e^{-1.7} ≈ 0.1827. Let me compute e^{-1.648}:\n\nLet me note that 1.648 is 1.6 + 0.048. So e^{-1.6 - 0.048} = e^{-1.6} * e^{-0.048} ≈ 0.2019 * e^{-0.048}.\n\nCompute e^{-0.048} ≈ 1 - 0.048 + (0.048)^2/2 - ... ≈ approx 0.953. Let me check with calculator-like steps: ln(0.95) ≈ -0.0513, so e^{-0.048} is slightly higher than 0.95. Let me use a Taylor expansion:\n\ne^{-x} ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x³/6. For x=0.048:\n\n≈ 1 - 0.048 + (0.048)^2 / 2 - (0.048)^3 / 6 ≈ 1 - 0.048 + 0.001152 - 0.0000184 ≈ 0.95313. So approx 0.9531.\n\nTherefore, e^{-1.648} ≈ 0.2019 * 0.9531 ≈ 0.2019 * 0.95 ≈ 0.1918 + 0.2019 * 0.0031 ≈ approx 0.1918 + 0.0006 ≈ 0.1924. So DA/DB ≈ 0.192, which is approximately 0.19, so option D.\n\nBut let me check if there was an error in my calculation steps. Let me go back through the steps again to verify.\n\nFirst, the formula for strain amplitude h. I assumed h ∝ M_c^{5/3} / d. Is that correct?\n\nThe standard formula for the gravitational wave strain from a binary system is:\n\nh ≈ (4 G^{1/2} M_c^{5/3} π^{2/3} f^{2/3}) / (c^4 d)\n\nYes, so h is proportional to M_c^{5/3} / d * f^{2/3}.\n\nBut the problem states that both the strain amplitude h and the frequency f are the same for both systems. Therefore, f_A = f_B. Therefore, the f^{2/3} terms are equal and cancel out when taking the ratio h_A / h_B. Therefore, the ratio reduces to [M_cA^{5/3} / d_A] / [M_cB^{5/3} / d_B] ] = 1, leading to d_A / d_B = (M_cA / M_cB)^{5/3}. So that part seems correct.\n\nThen calculating M_cA and M_cB.\n\nFor system A: m1=10, m2=25. Product m1*m2=250, sum m1+m2=35. Chirp mass M_cA = (250^3 / 35)^{1/5} as we said.\n\nFor system B: m1=35, m2=50. Product m1*m2=1750, sum m1+m2=85. Chirp mass M_cB = (1750^3 / 85)^{1/5}.\n\nThen the ratio M_cA / M_cB is [ (250^3 / 35) / (1750^3 / 85) ]^{1/5} = [ (250^3 * 85) / (1750^3 * 35) ]^{1/5}.\n\nSince 1750 = 7 * 250, so 1750^3 = 7^3 * 250^3. Therefore, substituting:\n\n[ (250^3 * 85) / (7^3 * 250^3 * 35) ]^{1/5} = [85 / (7^3 * 35)]^{1/5} = [85 / (343 * 35)]^{1/5}.\n\nCalculating denominator: 343 * 35. 343 * 35 = 343 * (30 + 5) = 10290 + 1715 = 12005. Therefore, the ratio inside is 85 / 12005 = 17 / 2401 ≈ 0.00708. Then taking the fifth root gives us approximately 0.372, as before. Then DA/DB = (0.372)^{5/3} ≈ 0.19. So this seems consistent.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using the fact that if the frequencies are the same, then the orbital frequencies are the same. The gravitational wave frequency is twice the orbital frequency for a binary system, assuming it's in a quasi-circular orbit. Therefore, if the gravitational wave frequencies are the same, then the orbital frequencies are the same. Let me recall that the orbital frequency f_orb is related to the masses and orbital separation via Kepler's law:\n\nf_orb = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(G (m1 + m2) / a^3)\n\nWhere a is the orbital separation. Therefore, if f_A = f_B, then:\n\nsqrt(G (mA_total)/a_A^3) = sqrt(G (mB_total)/a_B^3)\n\nTherefore, (mA_total)/a_A^3 = (mB_total)/a_B^3 => a_B^3 / a_A^3 = mB_total / mA_total => (a_B / a_A)^3 = mB_total / mA_total => a_B / a_A = [mB_total / mA_total]^{1/3}\n\nSo a_B / a_A = [85 / 35]^{1/3} ≈ [2.4286]^{1/3} ≈ 1.344.\n\nSo the orbital separation of system B is about 1.344 times that of system A.\n\nBut how does this relate to the strain amplitude? The strain amplitude also depends on the orbital separation, because the quadrupole moment depends on the separation. However, since the strain amplitude formula also depends on the mass and the distance, perhaps combining these relations can help.\n\nAlternatively, since we already used the frequency condition to derive the relation between the distances based on chirp masses, and arrived at DA/DB ≈ 0.19, which is option D, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut let me try another approach using the orbital frequency and the strain amplitude formula.\n\nThe strain amplitude h can also be expressed in terms of the orbital parameters. For a binary system, the strain amplitude is given by:\n\nh ≈ (4 G (m1 m2) / c^2 d) * (π f_orb)^{2/3}\n\nWait, but since f_grav = 2 f_orb, then f_orb = f_grav / 2. Therefore, substituting:\n\nh ≈ (4 G (m1 m2) / c^2 d) * (π (f_grav / 2))^{2/3}\n\nBut since f_grav is the same for both systems, let's denote f for both. Therefore, h ∝ (m1 m2) / d * f^{2/3}.\n\nBut wait, but we also have that the orbital frequency depends on the masses and the separation. Since f_orb is related to the masses and separation, and since we have that f_grav is the same, meaning f_orb is same for both systems?\n\nNo, f_grav is twice f_orb. If the gravitational wave frequency is same, then f_orb is same for both systems. Wait, no: f_grav = 2 f_orb, so if f_grav is same, then f_orb is same. Therefore, for both systems, f_orb is same. Therefore, using Kepler's law, we have:\n\nFor each system, (m1 + m2) / a^3 = (4 π^2 / G) f_orb^2 ?\n\nWait, Kepler's third law is:\n\n(G (m1 + m2)) / a^3 = (2 π f_orb)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\na^3 = G (m1 + m2) / (4 π^2 f_orb^2)\n\nTherefore, since f_orb is same for both systems, then a^3 ∝ (m1 + m2). Therefore, a_B^3 / a_A^3 = (mB_total) / (mA_total) => a_B / a_A = [mB_total / mA_total]^{1/3} as before.\n\nNow, the strain amplitude h is also dependent on the orbital separation. Let me recall that the formula for h can be written as:\n\nh ≈ (4 G (m1 m2) / c^2 d) * (π f_orb)^{2/3}\n\nBut since f_orb is same for both systems, and h is same, then:\n\n( (m1A m2A) / d_A ) = ( (m1B m2B) / d_B )\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the exact formula again.\n\nThe standard formula for the strain amplitude from a binary system is:\n\nh ≈ (4 G^{1/2} M_c^{5/3} π^{2/3} f^{2/3}) / (c^4 d)\n\nBut M_c = (m1 m2)^{3/5} / (m1 + m2)^{1/5}\n\nAlternatively, using the quadrupole formula, the amplitude is:\n\nh ≈ (2 G / (c^4 d)) * (m1 m2 / (a)) * (π f_orb)^{-1/3}\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to derive it.\n\nThe gravitational wave strain amplitude from a binary system can be approximated as:\n\nh ≈ (4 G^{1/2} (m1 m2)^{3/2} ) / (c^4 d (m1 + m2)^{1/2} a)) * (π f_orb)^{2/3}\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall that the orbital frequency f_orb is related to the orbital separation a via Kepler's law:\n\nf_orb = [ G (m1 + m2) / (4 π^2 a^3) ]^{1/2}\n\nTherefore, a^3 = G (m1 + m2) / (4 π^2 f_orb^2)\n\nSo a = [ G (m1 + m2) / (4 π^2 f_orb^2) ]^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, substituting a into the expression for h, which might depend on a. Assuming that h is proportional to (m1 m2)/a^2 * something? Wait, I need to recall that the quadrupole formula for gravitational waves gives the amplitude as:\n\nh ≈ (G / c^4) * (dQ/dt^2) / d, where Q is the quadrupole moment.\n\nFor a binary system, the quadrupole moment Q is proportional to m1 m2 a^2. The second derivative of Q would involve terms with the acceleration of the masses, which relates to the orbital frequency. This is getting complex, but perhaps I can find a relation between h and the masses, distance, and frequency.\n\nAlternatively, using dimensional analysis. The strain h is dimensionless. It depends on G (which has dimensions of [Mass^{-1} Length^3 Time^{-2}]), c (velocity), the masses, distance d, and frequency f.\n\nAssuming h ∝ (G^a c^b m1^c m2^d f^e) / d^g.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward. Let me instead use known relations.\n\nFrom earlier, we had that h ∝ M_c^{5/3} / (d f^{-2/3}).\n\nWait, no, earlier we had h ∝ M_c^{5/3} f^{2/3} / d.\n\nBut since we also have that f is related to the masses and a, and since in this problem f is fixed for both systems, perhaps combining these relations.\n\nBut since we already derived using the chirp mass that DA/DB ≈ 0.19, and the steps seem consistent, and given that the answer options include D: ~0.19, I think that is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check if I messed up the exponents in the chirp mass relation. Let me recall that the chirp mass is defined such that the orbital frequency's rate of change (the chirp) depends on M_c^{5/3}. However, in our case, the frequency is the same for both systems, so maybe we need to consider the relation between the chirp mass and the orbital frequency?\n\nWait, if the frequency is the same, and we have two different systems, then perhaps the orbital frequency is related to the chirp mass? No, the orbital frequency is related to the total mass and the orbital separation via Kepler's law, as we discussed earlier.\n\nBut since we already used Kepler's law to find the relation between a and total mass, and then used the chirp mass to relate to the strain amplitude, which gave us DA/DB ≈ 0.19, I think this is solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: ~0.19.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
