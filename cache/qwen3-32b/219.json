The problem says that after simplifying, it can be converted into the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D), where A, B, C, D are positive integers, and then find the sum A + B + C + D. Alright, let me start by recalling how to simplify expressions with radicals in the denominator. Usually, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. \n\nFirst, let me check if the denominator can be rationalized. The denominator here is 2 + √3. Its conjugate is 2 - √3. So, if I multiply both numerator and denominator by 2 - √3, that should eliminate the square root in the denominator. Let me try that.\n\nSo, multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 - √3:\n\n[(1 + √2)(2 - √3)] / [(2 + √3)(2 - √3)]\n\nLet me compute the denominator first. Using the difference of squares formula: (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Here, a is 2 and b is √3. Therefore, the denominator becomes:\n\n2² - (√3)² = 4 - 3 = 1. Wait, that's nice! The denominator simplifies to 1. That makes things easier. So, the entire expression simplifies to just the numerator: (1 + √2)(2 - √3). Let me expand that.\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n1 * 2 + 1 * (-√3) + √2 * 2 + √2 * (-√3)\n\nWhich is:\n\n2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nSo, putting it all together, the simplified expression is 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6. Now, the problem says that this can be converted to the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D). Let me try to rearrange the terms to match that form.\n\nFirst, let me group the terms:\n\n(2) + 2√2 - √3 - √6. Hmm. Let me see. The target form is A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D). Let me think about how to get there.\n\nLet me note that A(1 + √B) would distribute to A + A√B. Then subtracting (√C + √D) would give A + A√B - √C - √D. Comparing that to my current expression: 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nSo, if I can match the constants and the radicals. Let me see:\n\nA + A√B - √C - √D = 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nTherefore, we need:\n\nA (the constant term) is 2? Let me check. If A is 2, then A(1 + √B) would be 2 + 2√B. Then subtract (√C + √D) gives 2 + 2√B - √C - √D. Comparing to our expression: 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6. Therefore, if 2√B is 2√2, then B is 2. Then, -√C - √D should be -√3 - √6, so C is 3 and D is 6. Therefore, the expression would be A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D) with A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. Then A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me verify if my initial simplification is correct. Let me redo the multiplication step:\n\n(1 + √2)(2 - √3) = 1*2 + 1*(-√3) + √2*2 + √2*(-√3) = 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6. Yes, that seems right. Then, grouping terms: 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6. \n\nIf I take A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D), then if A is 2 and B is 2, then 2(1 + √2) is 2 + 2√2, and then subtracting (√3 + √6) gives exactly 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6. Perfect. So that matches. Therefore, A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. So the sum is 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way to represent it? The problem says \"can be converted to the form...\", so maybe there's another way? But this seems straightforward. Let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nOriginal expression: (1 + √2)/(2 + √3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 - √3. Denominator becomes 1, numerator becomes (1 + √2)(2 - √3). Which expands to 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6. Which is 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6. Which is 2(1 + √2) - √3 - √6. Which is exactly the form given in the problem: A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D). So A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. Therefore, A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem requires the terms to be ordered in a specific way? The problem says \"A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D)\". In my case, it's 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). So yes, that's exactly that form. Therefore, the answer is 13. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication step. Let me verify with decimal approximations.\n\nOriginal expression: (1 + √2)/(2 + √3). Let me compute approximate values.\n\n√2 ≈ 1.4142, √3 ≈ 1.732. Therefore, numerator ≈ 1 + 1.4142 ≈ 2.4142. Denominator ≈ 2 + 1.732 ≈ 3.732. Therefore, the original expression ≈ 2.4142 / 3.732 ≈ Let me compute that. Dividing 2.4142 by 3.732. Let me approximate:\n\nWell, 2.4142 / 3.732 ≈ 0.646. \n\nNow, my simplified expression is 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6. Let me compute that:\n\n2 ≈ 2\n\n2√2 ≈ 2.8284\n\n-√3 ≈ -1.732\n\n-√6 ≈ -2.449\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 2.8284 = 4.8284; 4.8284 - 1.732 ≈ 3.0964; 3.0964 - 2.449 ≈ 0.6474. Which is approximately 0.647, which matches the original value of approx 0.646. Close enough considering rounding errors. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute my final expression in the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D):\n\nA=2, B=2, so 2(1 + √2) ≈ 2*(2.4142) ≈ 4.8284. Then subtract √3 + √6 ≈ 1.732 + 2.449 ≈ 4.181. Therefore, 4.8284 - 4.181 ≈ 0.6474. Which again matches. So that seems correct. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\nTherefore, A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13. So the answer is 13. But let me check again if there's another possible way. For example, maybe there's another form where A, B, C, D are different? Let me think.\n\nSuppose someone tried to rationalize the denominator in a different way? But in this case, since the denominator is 2 + √3, the standard way is to multiply by 2 - √3, and we saw that gives us denominator 1. So that seems simplest. Alternatively, if there was a different approach? For example, if someone tried to first write numerator and denominator in terms of something else? But I don't think so. The problem says \"simplify\" and then convert to that form. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to rationalize twice? But no, since denominator became 1 after multiplying by conjugate. Therefore, the expression is simplified as (1 + √2)(2 - √3), which expands to 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6. Which is the same as 2(1 + √2) - √3 - √6. Which is exactly the given form. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 13. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13}\n</think>"}
