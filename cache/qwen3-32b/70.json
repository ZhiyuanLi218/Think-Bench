Let's start by going through each one step by step.\n\nOption A says that the conductivity of crystalline silicon is between conductors and insulators, which makes it a semiconductor. That part is correct because silicon is indeed a semiconductor. But then it says it's often used to manufacture fiber optics. Wait, I remember that fiber optics are usually made from materials like glass or silica (which is silicon dioxide, SiO2), not crystalline silicon. Crystalline silicon is used in things like solar cells and microchips. So maybe option A is incorrect because it's mixing up silicon with silica for fiber optics.\n\nOption B talks about high-pressure sodium lamps emitting yellow light with strong fog penetration and being used for road lighting. I think sodium vapor lamps do emit a yellowish light, and they are indeed used for street lighting because the yellow light can penetrate fog better than other colors. So B seems correct.\n\nOption C states that alumina (aluminum oxide) has a high melting point and is used in high-temperature resistant materials. Alumina is known for its high melting point and is used in things like crucibles and refractory materials. So C sounds correct.\n\nOption D mentions the limestone-gypsum method for desulfurizing coal flue gas and obtaining gypsum. I recall that in flue gas desulfurization, limestone (calcium carbonate) reacts with sulfur dioxide to produce calcium sulfite, which is then oxidized to calcium sulfate (gypsum). So yes, this process does produce gypsum as a byproduct. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nSo the incorrect statement is likely option A because fiber optics are made from silica, not crystalline silicon. Crystalline silicon is a semiconductor used in electronics, not optics. So the answer should be A.\n</think>"}
