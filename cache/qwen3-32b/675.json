This particle consists of **two protons and two neutrons**, which is essentially the nucleus of a **helium atom**.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Options:\n\n- **A: Another name for an electron**  \n  This is incorrect. Electrons are involved in **beta decay**, not alpha decay. They are much lighter and carry a -1 charge.\n\n- **B: Another name for a helium nucleus**  \n  ✅ **Correct.** An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a helium atom — composed of two protons and two neutrons. This gives it a **+2 charge** and a relatively large mass compared to other forms of radiation.\n\n- **C: Another name for a positron**  \n  This is also incorrect. A positron is the antimatter counterpart of an electron and is emitted during **beta-plus decay**, not alpha decay.\n\n- **D: Another name for a cosmic ray**  \n  While cosmic rays can include high-energy particles like protons and atomic nuclei, they are not the same as alpha particles. Cosmic rays originate from outer space, whereas alpha particles are emitted from the nucleus of a radioactive atom.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what an alpha particle is. The options are A through D. Let me start by recalling what I know about alpha particles.\n\nI remember from science class that alpha particles are related to radioactive decay. When an atom undergoes alpha decay, it emits an alpha particle. But what exactly is that particle? I think it's a type of radiation. Let me think... Alpha, beta, gamma... Oh right, alpha particles are one of the types of radiation. \n\nNow, the options are comparing it to electrons, helium nuclei, positrons, and cosmic rays. Let me break them down. \n\nOption A says it's another name for an electron. Wait, electrons are beta particles, right? Because beta decay involves electrons or positrons being emitted. So I don't think A is correct. \n\nOption B is another name for a helium nucleus. Hmm. I remember that alpha particles have a charge of +2 and they are relatively heavy. Helium has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. So if an alpha particle is a helium nucleus, that would make sense because it would have two protons and typically two neutrons. That gives it a +2 charge. Yeah, I think this might be the right answer. \n\nOption C is a positron. A positron is like an anti-electron, right? That's involved in beta plus decay. So that's not an alpha particle. So C is probably not correct. \n\nOption D is a cosmic ray. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles from space, usually protons or atomic nuclei. They're different from alpha particles, which are emitted during radioactive decay. So D doesn't seem right either. \n\nLet me double-check. Alpha particles are indeed helium nuclei. When an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses two protons and two neutrons. That's why the element's atomic number decreases by two and the mass number by four. So for example, uranium-238 decaying into thorium-234 by emitting an alpha particle. The alpha particle is just the helium nucleus. \n\nSo the answer should be B. Another name for a helium nucleus.\n</think>"}
