The problem mentions that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant KCa-EDTA is 5×10¹⁰. The options are given as A through D. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant (K) is a measure of how stable the complex is. A higher K value means the complex is more stable, so the concentration of free calcium ions should be lower because most of it is bound to EDTA.\n\nThe problem states that the solution is stoichiometric in Ca-EDTA. I think that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I need to figure out how much of the calcium is free versus complexed. \n\nLet me recall the formula for the formation constant. For the reaction:\n\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻\n\nThe formation constant K is given by:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nSince the solution is stoichiometric, I assume that initially, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are equal and they form the complex. But since the complex is already formed, maybe we need to consider the dissociation of the complex to find the free calcium ions.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of the complex as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. Let’s assume that a small amount x of the complex dissociates to form free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. So:\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[Ca²⁺] = x\n[EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x will be very small due to the large K)\n\nSo substituting into the K expression:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5×10¹⁰ = 0.02 / (x * x)\n\nWait, but the formula for K is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]). So rearranging:\n\n[Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] = [Ca-EDTA]/K\n\nSince [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, then:\n\nx² = [Ca-EDTA]/K = 0.02 / (5×10¹⁰)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nx² = 0.02 / (5×10¹⁰) = (2×10⁻²) / (5×10¹⁰) = (2/5) × 10⁻¹² = 0.4 × 10⁻¹² = 4 × 10⁻¹³\n\nThen x = sqrt(4×10⁻¹³) = 2×10⁻⁶·⁵? Wait, sqrt(4×10⁻¹³) is sqrt(4) times sqrt(10⁻¹³) which is 2 × 10^(-13/2) = 2 × 10^(-6.5). But 10^(-6.5) is 10^(-7 + 0.5) = 10^(-7) × sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16 × 10⁻⁷. So 2 × 3.16 × 10⁻⁷ ≈ 6.32 × 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.3×10⁻⁷ M. So that would be the answer. Let me check if I did everything right.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation step again. The K is given as 5×10¹⁰. So 1/K is 2×10⁻¹¹. Then [Ca²⁺]² = 0.02 × (1/K) ?\n\nWait, no. The formula is [Ca²⁺][EDTA] = [Ca-EDTA]/K. Since [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are both x, then x² = [Ca-EDTA]/K. So yes, x = sqrt( [Ca-EDTA]/K ). So substituting 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13. Then sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Which is 2 / 10^6.5. 10^6.5 is 10^6 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16×10^6. So 2 / 3.16×10^6 ≈ 0.63×10⁻⁶, so 6.3×10⁻⁷. That's option A. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me check if I got the formula right. The formation constant is K = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So solving for [Ca²+] gives sqrt( [complex]/K ). Wait, no. Wait, if K is large, then the complex is favored. The formula is K = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Therefore, [Ca²+][EDTA] = [complex]/K. Since [Ca²+] = [EDTA] = x, then x² = [complex]/K. Therefore, x = sqrt( [complex]/K ). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\nx = sqrt(0.02 / 5×10¹⁰) = sqrt( (2×10⁻²) / (5×10¹⁰) ) = sqrt( (2/5) × 10⁻¹² ) = sqrt(0.4 × 10⁻¹²) ≈ sqrt(4 × 10⁻¹³) ≈ 2 × 10⁻⁶.⁵ ≈ 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M. So yes, answer A.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's any other consideration. The problem says \"stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex\". That probably means that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA were equal, but since the complex is so stable, almost all of them are in the complex form. However, in our calculation, we considered that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is given. So the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is valid because K is very large (5e10), so the dissociation is minimal. Hence, the approximation [Ca-EDTA] ≈ 0.02 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: 6.3×10⁻⁷ M.\n</think>"}
