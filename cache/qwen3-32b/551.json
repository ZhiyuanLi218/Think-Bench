However, the problem states that the **reaction rate is quite small**, which is crucial for understanding the practical implications of this equilibrium.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n#### **Option A:**  \n> *K is very large, NO and CO have completely reacted before being released into the atmosphere.*\n\n- **Issue:** While the equilibrium constant is very large, implying that the reaction favors the products, the **reaction rate is slow**. This means that **in reality**, the reaction may not proceed to completion before the gases are released from the exhaust system. Thus, the large K does not guarantee that the reaction is complete in practice.\n- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n#### **Option B:**  \n> *Increasing the pressure, the equilibrium will shift to the right, K > 2.5 × 10⁶⁰.*\n\n- **Issue:** Increasing pressure will shift the equilibrium to the side with fewer moles of gas, which is the product side (1.5 moles) compared to the reactant side (2 moles). However, the **value of K is only affected by temperature**, not by pressure. So, while the equilibrium shifts, the value of K remains unchanged.\n- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n#### **Option C:**  \n> *Raising the temperature increases both the reaction rate and K.*\n\n- **Issue:** Raising the temperature **does increase the reaction rate**, but for an **exothermic** reaction, it shifts the equilibrium to the left (favoring reactants), which **decreases** the value of K. So while the rate increases, K decreases.\n- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n#### **Option D:**  \n> *Using an appropriate catalyst can meet the exhaust emission standards.*\n\n- **Correct Reasoning:** A catalyst increases the **reaction rate** by lowering the activation energy, without affecting the equilibrium constant. Since the reaction is thermodynamically favorable (large K) but kinetically slow, a catalyst would allow the reaction to proceed quickly enough in the exhaust system to significantly reduce the amounts of CO and NO emitted. This is a practical and scientifically sound approach.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about the reaction between carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen monoxide (NO) in car exhaust. The reaction given is CO(g) + NO(g) ⇌ CO₂(g) + ½ N₂(g), with a ΔH of -374.3 kJ·mol⁻¹ and a very large equilibrium constant K of 2.5 × 10^60. The problem states that the reaction rate is quite small, and we need to pick the correct statement from the options A to D.\n\nFirst, let me recall what I know about equilibrium constants and reaction rates. The equilibrium constant K tells us about the position of the equilibrium. A very large K means that the products are heavily favored at equilibrium. So, in this case, K is 2.5 × 10^60, which is an extremely large number. That suggests that when the reaction reaches equilibrium, almost all of the CO and NO would have been converted into CO₂ and N₂. However, the problem also mentions that the reaction rate is quite small. So even though the equilibrium favors the products, the reaction might be very slow to reach that equilibrium under normal conditions.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A says that because K is very large, NO and CO have completely reacted before being released into the atmosphere. But wait, if the reaction rate is small, even if the equilibrium is favorable, the reaction might not proceed quickly enough to reach that equilibrium before the gases are emitted. So maybe A is incorrect because it's about the reaction rate, not just the equilibrium constant. The high K means they should react completely if given enough time, but if the rate is slow, they might not have enough time in the exhaust system. So A might be wrong.\n\nOption B states that increasing the pressure shifts the equilibrium to the right and that K becomes greater than 2.5 × 10^60. Let's think about Le Chatelier's principle here. The reaction has 1 mole of CO and 1 mole of NO on the left (total 2 moles), and on the right, there's 1 mole of CO₂ and ½ mole of N₂, totaling 1.5 moles. So when pressure is increased, the system will shift to the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce the pressure. Since the right side has fewer moles (1.5 vs 2), increasing pressure should shift the equilibrium to the right. That part is correct. However, the value of K is temperature-dependent only. Changing the pressure doesn't change K. So the statement that K becomes larger is incorrect. Therefore, B is wrong because K remains the same when pressure is changed.\n\nOption C says raising the temperature increases both the reaction rate and K. The reaction is exothermic because ΔH is negative. For an exothermic reaction, increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left (favoring reactants), which would decrease K. However, the reaction rate generally increases with temperature because the molecules have more energy and collide more effectively. So while the rate does increase, the equilibrium constant K would decrease. Therefore, option C is incorrect because it claims both rate and K increase, but K actually decreases.\n\nOption D suggests using an appropriate catalyst can meet the exhaust emission standards. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy, which increases the reaction rate without affecting the equilibrium position (they don't change K). Since the problem states that the reaction rate is quite small, using a catalyst would help the reaction proceed faster to reach equilibrium, even though the equilibrium is already favorable. This would allow the reaction to occur more quickly in the exhaust system, reducing the amounts of CO and NO emitted. So D seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check each point. The key here is that the reaction has a very favorable thermodynamics (large K) but slow kinetics. Therefore, without a catalyst, the reaction doesn't proceed fast enough in the exhaust system. A catalyst would increase the rate, allowing the reaction to reach equilibrium (which is already product-favored) more quickly. Therefore, D is the correct answer. The other options have issues: A ignores the slow rate, B incorrectly says K changes with pressure, and C incorrectly states that K increases with temperature for an exothermic reaction.\n</think>"}
