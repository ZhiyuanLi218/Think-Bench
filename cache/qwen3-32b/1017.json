The wave is polarized parallel to the interface, which I think means it's p-polarized. The given refractive indices are n1 = 1.75 (medium 1) and n2 = 1.26 (medium 2). The angle of incidence is 80 degrees, which is more than the critical angle. The wavelength in medium 1 is 400 nm. The options are given, so I need to calculate the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should recall what lateral displacement means in this context. From what I remember, when a wave undergoes total internal reflection, even though there's no transmitted wave propagating into medium 2, there is an evanescent wave that decays exponentially. However, the reflected wave isn't exactly in phase with the incident wave, leading to a lateral shift known as the Goos-Hänchen shift. But I need to confirm if that's what the question is referring to as lateral displacement. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the penetration depth of the evanescent wave? Wait, no, penetration depth is how far the evanescent wave extends into medium 2, but the question mentions lateral displacement of the beam while getting reflected. So that's probably the Goos-Hänchen shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another formula for lateral displacement. Let me think. For total internal reflection, the reflection coefficient for p-polarized light is complex, leading to a phase shift upon reflection. This phase shift can cause a lateral displacement of the reflected beam. The formula for the lateral displacement (Δ) might involve the wavelength, the angle of incidence, and the properties of the media.\n\nI need to find the critical angle first. The critical angle i₀ is given by sin⁻¹(n2/n1). Let me calculate that.\n\nn2/n1 = 1.26 / 1.75 ≈ 0.719. So the critical angle i₀ = arcsin(0.719). Let me compute that. Let's see, arcsin(0.719) is approximately... Well, sin(45°) is about 0.707, and sin(46°) is about 0.719. So the critical angle is approximately 46 degrees. Since the angle of incidence is 80 degrees, which is more than 46 degrees, total internal reflection occurs.\n\nNow, for the lateral displacement. I need to recall the formula for the Goos-Hänchen shift. The formula for the lateral shift Δ is given by:\n\nΔ = (λ / (2π)) * (k_x / k_z) * tan(θ_i) * |Γ|² / (1 - |Γ|²)\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the penetration depth and then relate it to the lateral shift. Wait, no. Maybe I need to use the formula for the Goos-Hänchen shift which is approximately:\n\nΔ ≈ (λ / (2π)) * (tan θ_i) / (sqrt(sin² θ_i - n2²/n1²))\n\nBut I need to check the exact formula. Let me try to derive it or recall.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the lateral displacement can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔ = (d / cos θ_i) * sin(δ/2)\n\nWhere d is the distance the wave travels in medium 1 before reflection, and δ is the phase shift upon reflection. However, since the reflection occurs at the interface, maybe d is related to the penetration depth? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the complex transmission coefficient, but since it's total internal reflection, the transmission coefficient becomes evanescent. The phase shift upon reflection can be found from the Fresnel equations for p-polarization.\n\nThe Fresnel reflection coefficient for p-polarization is:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 sqrt(1 - (n1²/n2²) sin² θ_i)] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 sqrt(1 - (n1²/n2²) sin² θ_i)]\n\nWait, but since n2 < n1 and θ_i > θ_c, the term inside the sqrt becomes negative. So we can write sqrt( (n1²/n2²) sin² θ_i - 1 ). Let me define that.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor total internal reflection, the refracted angle θ_t is complex. However, the expression for the reflection coefficient becomes complex, leading to a phase shift. The formula for r_p in this case can be written as:\n\nr_p = [cos θ_i - i (sin² θ_i - (n2/n1)^2 )^{-1/2} sin θ_i ] / [cos θ_i + i (sin² θ_i - (n2/n1)^2 )^{-1/2} sin θ_i ]\n\nBut I need to recall the exact expression. Alternatively, using the formula for the phase shift for p-polarization during total internal reflection.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the lateral displacement Δ is given by:\n\nΔ = (λ / (2π)) * (1 / (k_z)) * tan θ_i * |r_p|² / (1 - |r_p|²)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I need to refer to the Goos-Hänchen shift formula. According to some references, the lateral displacement Δ can be approximated by:\n\nΔ ≈ (λ / (2π)) * (tan θ_i) / (sqrt(sin² θ_i - (n2/n1)^2))\n\nBut I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that during total internal reflection, the evanescent wave has a decay constant κ, given by:\n\nκ = (ω / c) * sqrt(n1² sin² θ_i - n2²)\n\nBut ω is the angular frequency, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. However, the wavelength in medium 1 is given as λ = 400 nm. The wavelength in medium 1 is λ1 = λ0 / n1, where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength. Wait, but the problem states \"the wavelength of the wave in the medium#1 is λ = 400 nm\". So λ1 = 400 nm. Therefore, the vacuum wavelength λ0 = λ1 * n1 = 400 nm * 1.75 = 700 nm. But maybe I need the wavelength in medium 1 for calculations. Let me note that.\n\nBut perhaps I need to compute the phase shift upon reflection. The phase shift for p-polarization can be calculated from the Fresnel equations. Let me try to compute r_p.\n\nGiven θ_i = 80 degrees, n1 = 1.75, n2 = 1.26.\n\nFirst, compute sin θ_i. sin(80°) ≈ 0.9848.\n\nCompute (n2/n1) = 1.26 / 1.75 ≈ 0.719. So sin θ_i = 0.9848, which is greater than 0.719, so total internal reflection occurs.\n\nFor p-polarization, the reflection coefficient r_p is given by:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 sqrt(1 - (n1²/n2²) sin² θ_i)] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 sqrt(1 - (n1²/n2²) sin² θ_i)]\n\nWait, but since it's total internal reflection, the term inside the sqrt becomes negative. Let me rearrange the formula. Actually, the standard formula for r_p during total internal reflection involves complex numbers. Let me use the formula:\n\nFor p-polarization during TIR,\n\nr_p = [tan(θ_i - θ_t)] / [tan(θ_i + θ_t)]\n\nBut θ_t is complex. Alternatively, using the formula from the Fresnel equations:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 sqrt(1 - (n2/n1)^2 sin² θ_i)] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 sqrt(1 - (n2/n1)^2 sin² θ_i)]\n\nLet me compute the term inside the square root:\n\nLet me compute (n2/n1)^2 sin² θ_i = (0.719)^2 * (0.9848)^2 ≈ 0.517 * 0.9698 ≈ 0.500.\n\nThen 1 - 0.500 = 0.5. Wait, but sqrt(0.5) is real? Wait, but that would mean that sqrt(1 - (n2/n1)^2 sin² θ_i) is sqrt(0.5). But that would be real, which contradicts the idea of total internal reflection. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the formula for r_p is:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 sqrt(1 - (n2/n1)^2 sin² θ_i)] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 sqrt(1 - (n2/n1)^2 sin² θ_i)]\n\nBut for total internal reflection, the term inside the sqrt should be negative. Wait, let's check:\n\nThe condition for total internal reflection is sin θ_i > n2/n1. So sin θ_i > n2/n1. Therefore, (n2/n1) sin θ_i > (n2/n1)^2. Wait, but the term inside the square root is 1 - (n2/n1)^2 sin² θ_i. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the general formula for the denominator in the Fresnel equations for p-polarization is sqrt(1 - (n1²/n2²) sin² θ_i). Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong.\n\nActually, the correct formula for r_p is:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 cos θ_t] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 cos θ_t]\n\nWhere θ_t is the transmitted angle. But for TIR, θ_t is complex. However, using Snell's law:\n\nn1 sin θ_i = n2 sin θ_t.\n\nBut since θ_i > θ_c, sin θ_t = (n1/n2) sin θ_i > 1, which is not possible for real θ_t. Therefore, θ_t becomes complex. Let me write cos θ_t in terms of θ_i.\n\nFrom Snell's law:\n\nsin θ_t = (n1/n2) sin θ_i.\n\nBut since this is greater than 1, we can write:\n\nsin θ_t = i sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1 )\n\nTherefore, cos θ_t = sqrt(1 - sin² θ_t) = sqrt(1 - (n1²/n2² sin² θ_i - 1)) = sqrt(2 - n1²/n2² sin² θ_i). Wait, but this seems problematic because sqrt of a negative number? Wait, no, because:\n\nWait, cos θ_t = sqrt(1 - sin² θ_t). But if sin θ_t is imaginary, then sin² θ_t is negative, so 1 - sin² θ_t is 1 + positive number. Therefore, cos θ_t is real?\n\nWait, let me do it step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet’s set sin θ_t = (n1/n2) sin θ_i. Since θ_i > θ_c, this is greater than 1. Let me write sin θ_t = i κ, where κ is real. Therefore, sin θ_t = i sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1 ). Therefore, cos θ_t = sqrt(1 - sin² θ_t) = sqrt(1 - (-κ²)) = sqrt(1 + κ²) = real number. Therefore, cos θ_t is real. Therefore, cos θ_t = sqrt(1 + (n1²/n2² sin² θ_i - 1)) = sqrt(n1²/n2² sin² θ_i). Wait, that can't be right. Wait:\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nIf sin θ_t = i κ, then:\n\nsin² θ_t = -κ².\n\nTherefore, cos θ_t = sqrt(1 - sin² θ_t) = sqrt(1 + κ²).\n\nBut κ² = (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1.\n\nTherefore, cos θ_t = sqrt(1 + (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1) = sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i ) = (n1/n2) sin θ_i.\n\nWait, that seems strange. Wait, but cos θ_t is supposed to be real? But then if θ_t is complex, how is cos θ_t real? Let me check with numbers.\n\nGiven n1 = 1.75, n2 = 1.26, θ_i = 80 degrees.\n\nsin θ_i ≈ 0.9848.\n\n(n1/n2) sin θ_i = (1.75 / 1.26) * 0.9848 ≈ 1.3889 * 0.9848 ≈ 1.368. So sin θ_t ≈ 1.368, which is imaginary. So sin θ_t = i * sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1 ) ≈ i * sqrt( (1.3889)^2 * 0.9698 - 1 ). Wait, maybe I need to compute:\n\n(n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1 = ( (1.75 / 1.26)^2 ) * sin²(80°) - 1 ≈ (1.3889²) * (0.9848²) - 1 ≈ 1.929 * 0.9698 - 1 ≈ 1.869 - 1 = 0.869. Therefore, sqrt(0.869) ≈ 0.932. Therefore, sin θ_t = i * 0.932. Therefore, cos θ_t = sqrt(1 + (0.932)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.869) ≈ sqrt(1.869) ≈ 1.367.\n\nTherefore, cos θ_t ≈ 1.367. Therefore, substituting back into the formula for r_p:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 cos θ_t] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 cos θ_t]\n\nCompute cos θ_i for θ_i = 80 degrees. cos(80°) ≈ 0.1736.\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumerator: n2 * cos θ_i - n1 * cos θ_t = 1.26 * 0.1736 - 1.75 * 1.367 ≈ 0.2187 - 2.392 ≈ -2.1733\n\nDenominator: n2 * cos θ_i + n1 * cos θ_t = 1.26 * 0.1736 + 1.75 * 1.367 ≈ 0.2187 + 2.392 ≈ 2.6107\n\nTherefore, r_p ≈ -2.1733 / 2.6107 ≈ -0.832. Wait, but this is a real number? But I thought r_p would have a phase shift, hence being complex. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Wait, because cos θ_t is real, but θ_t is complex. However, the formula for r_p is as above. But since cos θ_t is real, then r_p is real? But that would imply no phase shift, which contradicts the idea of Goos-Hänchen shift. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me check again. The formula for r_p is:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 cos θ_t] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 cos θ_t]\n\nBut θ_t is complex, but in our calculation, cos θ_t came out real. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I need to consider that when θ_t is complex, cos θ_t is complex? Wait, earlier steps led me to think it's real. Let me check again.\n\nFrom Snell's law:\n\nn1 sin θ_i = n2 sin θ_t\n\nFor TIR, sin θ_t = (n1/n2) sin θ_i > 1. Let me define sin θ_t = i κ, where κ is real. Then:\n\nsin θ_t = i κ\n\nTherefore, cos θ_t = sqrt(1 - sin² θ_t) = sqrt(1 + κ²). So cos θ_t is real. Therefore, yes, cos θ_t is real. Therefore, substituting into r_p gives real numbers? But then how does the phase shift come into play?\n\nWait, but if r_p is real, then the reflection coefficient is either positive or negative. However, for TIR, the reflection coefficient should have a phase shift, meaning it's complex. There's a contradiction here. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, the formula for r_p is valid for both transmission and reflection. However, when θ_t is complex, the formula still holds mathematically, but θ_t is not a real angle. However, the result is real? That seems odd. But according to the calculation above, with numbers plugged in, it gives a real number. But according to the theory, during TIR, the reflection coefficient should have a phase shift depending on polarization, hence complex. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my derivation.\n\nWait, let me check another source. The Fresnel equations for p-polarization:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 cos θ_t] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 cos θ_t]\n\nBut during TIR, θ_t is complex. However, cos θ_t is real as shown above. Therefore, r_p is real? But that can't be, because phase shift is expected. Wait, but perhaps the formula is different? Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the reflection coefficient during TIR. Let me recall that for s-polarization, the reflection coefficient is always -1, but for p-polarization, it varies. However, during TIR, both s and p polarizations have |r| = 1, but different phase shifts.\n\nWait, if |r_p| = 1, then r_p is a complex number of magnitude 1, i.e., e^{iδ}, where δ is the phase shift. But according to my previous calculation, r_p is -0.832, which has magnitude 0.832, which is less than 1. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The correct formula for the reflection coefficient for p-polarization is:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_t - n1 cos θ_i] / [n2 cos θ_t + n1 cos θ_i]\n\nWait, maybe I had the numerator and denominator reversed? Let me check the standard Fresnel equations.\n\nThe standard Fresnel equation for r_p is:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 cos θ_t] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 cos θ_t]\n\nBut for s-polarization, it's [n1 cos θ_i - n2 cos θ_t] / [n1 cos θ_i + n2 cos θ_t]. Wait, maybe I mixed up the order. Let me check a reference.\n\nAccording to the Fresnel equations, for p-polarization, the reflection coefficient is:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 cos θ_t] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 cos θ_t]\n\nYes, that's correct. But during TIR, cos θ_t is real? As per earlier calculation, yes. But how can r_p have magnitude less than 1? For TIR, |r_p| should be 1. Let me compute |r_p| from my previous numbers.\n\nNumerator ≈ -2.1733, denominator ≈ 2.6107. Therefore, r_p ≈ -0.832. The magnitude is 0.832, which is less than 1. That contradicts the fact that during TIR, the reflection is total, so |r_p| should be 1. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAh! Wait, I think I see the problem. When I calculated cos θ_t, I used:\n\ncos θ_t = sqrt(1 + κ²), where κ² = (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1. But actually, the relation between cos θ_t and sin θ_t for complex θ_t is not the same as for real θ_t? Wait, no. For any complex angle θ_t, we have:\n\nsin² θ_t + cos² θ_t = 1.\n\nTherefore, if sin θ_t is imaginary, say sin θ_t = i κ, then cos θ_t = sqrt(1 - sin² θ_t) = sqrt(1 + κ²). So that part is correct. Therefore, cos θ_t is real. Therefore, the formula for r_p gives a real number with magnitude less than 1? That can't be. Where is the error?\n\nWait, let me check with s-polarization. For s-polarization, the reflection coefficient is:\n\nr_s = [n1 cos θ_i - n2 cos θ_t] / [n1 cos θ_i + n2 cos θ_t]\n\nBut during TIR, cos θ_t is real. Let me compute it for s-polarization.\n\nUsing the same numbers:\n\nn1 = 1.75, n2 = 1.26, θ_i = 80°, cos θ_i ≈ 0.1736, cos θ_t ≈ 1.367.\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumerator: n1 cos θ_i - n2 cos θ_t ≈ 1.75 * 0.1736 - 1.26 * 1.367 ≈ 0.3038 - 1.722 ≈ -1.418\n\nDenominator: n1 cos θ_i + n2 cos θ_t ≈ 0.3038 + 1.722 ≈ 2.0258\n\nTherefore, r_s ≈ -1.418 / 2.0258 ≈ -0.7, magnitude ≈ 0.7. Again less than 1. But for TIR, |r_s| should be 1. So clearly, there is a problem here. What is the mistake?\n\nAh! I think I made a mistake in the expression for cos θ_t. Wait, let me re-derive cos θ_t properly.\n\nFrom Snell's law:\n\nn1 sin θ_i = n2 sin θ_t\n\nFor TIR, sin θ_t = (n1/n2) sin θ_i > 1. Let me define sin θ_t = i κ, where κ is real. Therefore, sin θ_t = i κ. Then using the identity:\n\ncos θ_t = sqrt(1 - sin² θ_t) = sqrt(1 - (-κ²)) = sqrt(1 + κ²). But this is assuming that θ_t is such that cos θ_t is positive? But θ_t is complex, so maybe I need to be careful with the square root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cos θ_t is imaginary? Wait, let me think again. Let me write θ_t as a complex number. Let me assume θ_t = π/2 + i φ, where φ is real. Then:\n\nsin θ_t = sin(π/2 + iφ) = cos(iφ) = cosh φ\n\ncos θ_t = cos(π/2 + iφ) = -sin(iφ) = -i sinh φ\n\nSo in this case, sin θ_t is real and greater than 1, and cos θ_t is imaginary. Therefore, perhaps my earlier assumption that cos θ_t is real is incorrect. Therefore, there is a mistake in my previous calculation.\n\nSo let me try this approach. Let me assume θ_t = π/2 + iφ, then:\n\nFrom Snell's law:\n\nn1 sin θ_i = n2 sin θ_t = n2 cosh φ\n\nTherefore, cosh φ = (n1/n2) sin θ_i\n\nTherefore, φ = arccosh[(n1/n2) sin θ_i]\n\nThen cos θ_t = -i sinh φ\n\nTherefore, substituting into the Fresnel equation for r_p:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 cos θ_t] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 cos θ_t] = [n2 cos θ_i - n1 (-i sinh φ)] / [n2 cos θ_i + n1 (-i sinh φ)] = [n2 cos θ_i + i n1 sinh φ] / [n2 cos θ_i - i n1 sinh φ]\n\nThis is a complex number. Therefore, the reflection coefficient is complex, which makes sense for TIR with phase shift.\n\nTherefore, my earlier mistake was in assuming that cos θ_t is real, but in reality, when θ_t is complex, cos θ_t is imaginary. Therefore, need to recalculate.\n\nLet me proceed with this corrected approach.\n\nGiven θ_t = π/2 + iφ, then:\n\ncosh φ = (n1/n2) sin θ_i\n\nTherefore, sinh φ = sqrt(cosh² φ - 1) = sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1 )\n\nTherefore, cos θ_t = -i sinh φ = -i sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin² θ_i - 1 )\n\nTherefore, substituting into r_p:\n\nr_p = [n2 cos θ_i + i n1 sinh φ] / [n2 cos θ_i - i n1 sinh φ]\n\nLet me compute this for our specific case.\n\nFirst, compute sinh φ:\n\n(n1/n2) sin θ_i = (1.75 / 1.26) * sin(80°) ≈ 1.3889 * 0.9848 ≈ 1.368\n\nTherefore, cosh φ = 1.368, so sinh φ = sqrt(1.368² - 1) ≈ sqrt(1.871 - 1) = sqrt(0.871) ≈ 0.933.\n\nTherefore, sinh φ ≈ 0.933.\n\nNow, compute numerator and denominator:\n\nn2 cos θ_i = 1.26 * cos(80°) ≈ 1.26 * 0.1736 ≈ 0.2187\n\ni n1 sinh φ = i * 1.75 * 0.933 ≈ i * 1.6328\n\nTherefore, numerator = 0.2187 + i * 1.6328\n\nDenominator = 0.2187 - i * 1.6328\n\nTherefore, r_p = (0.2187 + i * 1.6328) / (0.2187 - i * 1.6328)\n\nTo compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nDenominator's conjugate: 0.2187 + i * 1.6328\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumerator becomes: (0.2187 + i * 1.6328)(0.2187 + i * 1.6328) = (0.2187)^2 + 2 * 0.2187 * i * 1.6328 + (i * 1.6328)^2\n\n= 0.0478 + i * 0.715 - (1.6328)^2\n\n= 0.0478 + i * 0.715 - 2.666\n\n= -2.618 + i * 0.715\n\nDenominator becomes: (0.2187)^2 + (1.6328)^2 ≈ 0.0478 + 2.666 ≈ 2.7138\n\nTherefore, r_p ≈ (-2.618 + i * 0.715) / 2.7138 ≈ -0.964 + i * 0.263\n\nSo r_p ≈ -0.964 + i * 0.263\n\nLet me check the magnitude: |r_p| = sqrt((-0.964)^2 + (0.263)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.929 + 0.069) ≈ sqrt(0.998) ≈ 1. So that makes sense for TIR, |r_p| = 1. Good.\n\nNow, the phase shift δ is the argument of r_p. Since r_p is complex, we can write it as e^{iδ}. Let me compute δ.\n\nThe complex number is -0.964 + i * 0.263. This is in the second quadrant (real part negative, imaginary part positive). The angle δ can be calculated as π - arctan(0.263 / 0.964).\n\nCompute 0.263 / 0.964 ≈ 0.273. arctan(0.273) ≈ 15.3 degrees. Therefore, δ ≈ π - 15.3° ≈ 180° - 15.3° = 164.7° in radians, but let me convert to radians for calculation.\n\nWait, but I need δ in radians to compute the lateral displacement. Alternatively, maybe I can use the complex exponential to find the phase shift.\n\nAlternatively, the phase shift δ can be calculated as:\n\nδ = arctan(Im(r_p)/Re(r_p)) + π, since it's in the second quadrant.\n\nSo Im(r_p)/Re(r_p) = 0.263 / (-0.964) ≈ -0.273. Therefore, arctan(-0.273) ≈ -15.3°, so adding π gives 180° - 15.3° = 164.7°, which is approximately 2.875 radians (since 180° is π ≈ 3.1416, so 164.7° ≈ 2.875 radians).\n\nNow, the lateral displacement Δ is related to this phase shift. According to some sources, the lateral displacement Δ is given by:\n\nΔ = (λ / (2π)) * tan θ_i * δ / cos θ_i\n\nWait, I need to find the correct formula. The Goos-Hänchen shift Δ is approximately given by:\n\nΔ ≈ (λ / (2π)) * tan θ_i * δ / cos θ_i\n\nWait, or maybe Δ ≈ (λ / (2π)) * tan θ_i * δ / cos θ_t ?\n\nWait, let me think. The phase shift δ causes a shift in the reflected wave. The lateral displacement can be approximated by considering the phase shift as a path difference. The phase shift δ corresponds to a path difference of Δ = (δ / k) * sin θ_i, where k is the wave number in medium 1. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the lateral displacement Δ is given by:\n\nΔ = (δ / k) * tan θ_i\n\nWhere k is the wave number in medium 1.\n\nLet me check this. The wave number in medium 1 is k1 = 2π / λ1, where λ1 is the wavelength in medium 1. Given that λ1 = 400 nm, so k1 = 2π / (400 nm).\n\nIf the phase shift is δ, then the equivalent path length causing this phase shift is Δ * k1 * tan θ_i = δ. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the lateral displacement Δ can be found from the phase shift δ as Δ = δ / (k1 * sin θ_i). Wait, need to think carefully.\n\nThe phase shift δ corresponds to a shift in the wavefront. For a plane wave, a lateral shift Δ would result in a phase difference of Δ * k * sin θ, where k is the wavevector component along the interface. The wavevector component along the interface is k_parallel = k1 * sin θ_i. Therefore, the phase shift due to a lateral displacement Δ would be Δ * k_parallel = Δ * k1 * sin θ_i. Setting this equal to the phase shift δ gives Δ = δ / (k1 * sin θ_i).\n\nBut wait, the phase shift δ is already the phase difference between the incident and reflected wave. Therefore, equating:\n\nΔ * k1 * sin θ_i = δ => Δ = δ / (k1 * sin θ_i)\n\nBut k1 = 2π / λ1, so:\n\nΔ = δ * λ1 / (2π sin θ_i)\n\nAlternatively, I found some references stating that the Goos-Hänchen shift Δ is approximately:\n\nΔ ≈ (λ / (2π)) * (tan θ_i) * δ\n\nBut I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, according to the formula from Wikipedia or other sources, the Goos-Hänchen shift for p-polarization is given by:\n\nΔ ≈ - (λ / (2π)) * (tan θ_i) * (dδ/dθ_i)\n\nBut this is a more advanced formula involving derivative of the phase shift. However, this might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula from the paper or textbook: For small phase shifts, Δ ≈ (δ / k) * tan θ_i. Let me assume that.\n\nLet me proceed with Δ = (δ / k1) * tan θ_i.\n\nGiven that k1 = 2π / λ1, so Δ = (δ * λ1 / (2π)) * tan θ_i.\n\nLet me compute δ first. Earlier, I found δ ≈ 2.875 radians.\n\nLet me compute it more accurately. From the complex number r_p ≈ -0.964 + i * 0.263.\n\nThe phase angle δ is arctan(Im/Re) + π. Since Re is negative and Im is positive, angle is in second quadrant.\n\nCompute Im/Re = 0.263 / (-0.964) ≈ -0.2728. arctan(-0.2728) ≈ -15.3 degrees ≈ -0.267 radians. Therefore, δ ≈ π - 0.267 ≈ 2.875 radians, as before.\n\nNow, compute Δ:\n\nΔ ≈ (δ * λ1 / (2π)) * tan θ_i.\n\nGiven λ1 = 400 nm, θ_i = 80 degrees.\n\ntan θ_i ≈ tan(80°) ≈ 5.671.\n\nTherefore:\n\nΔ ≈ (2.875 * 400 nm / (2π)) * 5.671 ≈ (2.875 * 400 / 6.283) * 5.671 ≈ (1150 / 6.283) * 5.671 ≈ 183.1 * 5.671 ≈ 1038 nm.\n\nBut this is way larger than the given options (which are up to ~200 nm). Clearly, something is wrong here. My approximation must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is Δ ≈ (δ * λ1 / (2π)) / tan θ_i? Let me try that.\n\nΔ ≈ (2.875 * 400 nm / (2π)) / 5.671 ≈ (1150 / 6.283) / 5.671 ≈ 183.1 / 5.671 ≈ 32.3 nm. Still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Δ ≈ (δ * λ1 / (2π)) * something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the formula from the Goos-Hänchen shift, which is given by:\n\nΔ ≈ (λ / (2π)) * (tan θ_i) / (sqrt(sin² θ_i - (n2/n1)^2))\n\nLet me try this formula. Given that λ is the wavelength in medium 1, which is 400 nm.\n\nCompute denominator: sqrt(sin² θ_i - (n2/n1)^2) = sqrt( (0.9848)^2 - (0.719)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.9698 - 0.517) ≈ sqrt(0.4528) ≈ 0.673.\n\nThen tan θ_i ≈ 5.671.\n\nTherefore:\n\nΔ ≈ (400 nm / (2π)) * 5.671 / 0.673 ≈ (63.66 nm) * 8.427 ≈ 537 nm. Still too big.\n\nBut the given options are about 75-186 nm. So clearly, my approach is wrong.\n\nLet me look for another way. Maybe the lateral displacement is related to the penetration depth of the evanescent wave.\n\nThe penetration depth δ_pen is given by:\n\nδ_pen = (λ0 / (2π)) * 1 / sqrt(n1² sin² θ_i - n2²)\n\nWhere λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum. But we are given λ1 = 400 nm, which is λ0 / n1. Therefore, λ0 = λ1 * n1 = 400 nm * 1.75 = 700 nm.\n\nTherefore:\n\nδ_pen = (700 nm / (2π)) * 1 / sqrt( (1.75)^2 sin²(80°) - (1.26)^2 )\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n(1.75)^2 sin²(80°) - (1.26)^2 ≈ 3.0625 * 0.9698 - 1.5876 ≈ 2.969 - 1.5876 ≈ 1.381\n\nsqrt(1.381) ≈ 1.175\n\nTherefore:\n\nδ_pen ≈ (700 / 6.283) / 1.175 ≈ 111.4 / 1.175 ≈ 94.8 nm\n\nThis is the penetration depth. But how is this related to lateral displacement?\n\nAlternatively, the lateral displacement might be related to the product of the penetration depth and tan(θ_i - θ_t), but θ_t is complex. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the beam is incident at an angle θ_i, and the evanescent wave decays exponentially with distance into medium 2, the lateral shift could be approximated by considering the beam's width and the phase shift. But without knowing the beam's properties, it's hard to calculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the formula for the Goos-Hänchen shift which is given by:\n\nΔ = (λ / (2π)) * (tan θ_i) * (dδ/dθ_i)\n\nWhere dδ/dθ_i is the derivative of the phase shift with respect to the angle of incidence. This formula is more accurate but requires knowing how δ varies with θ_i.\n\nGiven that I have already calculated δ for θ_i = 80°, I need to estimate dδ/dθ_i. However, without knowing the exact function δ(θ_i), this is difficult. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it numerically.\n\nBut since I don't have time for that, maybe I can find another approach.\n\nWait, another formula I found online: The lateral displacement Δ is given by:\n\nΔ = (λ / (2π)) * (tan θ_i) / (sqrt(sin² θ_i - (n2/n1)^2))\n\nBut earlier calculation gave 537 nm, which is not in the options. But maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let me check the units. λ is in nm, and the other terms are dimensionless, so Δ is in nm. But 537 nm is not in the options. The options are much smaller. Perhaps I missed a factor of 1/n or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nΔ = (λ / (2π)) * (1 / (sqrt(sin² θ_i - (n2/n1)^2)))\n\nLet me try that:\n\nΔ ≈ (400 nm / (2π)) * 1 / 0.673 ≈ 63.66 nm * 1.486 ≈ 94.5 nm. Close to the penetration depth. But the options don't have this. The closest is 75.39 nm (option A). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nΔ = (λ / (2π)) * (tan θ_i) * sqrt(sin² θ_i - (n2/n1)^2)\n\nBut that would give 63.66 * 5.671 * 0.673 ≈ 63.66 * 3.815 ≈ 243 nm. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the phase shift δ calculated earlier and relate it to the lateral displacement through the beam's properties. For example, if the beam has a certain width, the phase shift causes a shift in the beam's position. However, without knowing the beam's width or other parameters, this is not feasible.\n\nWait, but the question says \"lateral displacement of the beam while getting reflected\". This might refer to the spatial shift of the reflected beam relative to the incident beam. For a plane wave, there is no lateral shift, but for a real beam (with finite width), the Goos-Hänchen shift occurs. However, since the problem gives a wavelength and asks for a numerical answer, it likely expects a formula-based calculation.\n\nLet me try to recall another approach. The lateral displacement Δ can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔ = (λ / (2π)) * (k_parallel / k_z) * tan θ_i * |r|^2 / (1 - |r|^2)\n\nWait, but earlier calculations showed |r| = 1, so this would be zero. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for the evanescent wave, the lateral displacement might be related to the decay length and the angle. But I need a better approach.\n\nLet me refer back to the complex reflection coefficient. The reflection coefficient r_p is complex: r_p ≈ -0.964 + i * 0.263. Let me write this in polar form. The magnitude is 1, as expected, and the phase δ ≈ 2.875 radians as before.\n\nThe lateral displacement Δ is related to this phase shift. For a plane wave, the phase shift δ corresponds to a shift in the wavefront. For a wave incident at angle θ_i, the wavefronts are tilted. The phase shift δ would result in a lateral displacement Δ such that the phase difference along the interface is δ. \n\nThe wavevector component along the interface is k_parallel = k1 * sin θ_i. The phase shift δ corresponds to a path difference of Δ * k_parallel = δ. Hence:\n\nΔ = δ / k_parallel = δ / (k1 * sin θ_i)\n\nSince k1 = 2π / λ1, this becomes:\n\nΔ = δ * λ1 / (2π sin θ_i)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nδ ≈ 2.875 rad\n\nλ1 = 400 nm\n\nsin θ_i ≈ 0.9848\n\nTherefore:\n\nΔ ≈ (2.875 * 400 nm) / (2π * 0.9848) ≈ (1150 nm) / (6.283 * 0.9848) ≈ 1150 / 6.187 ≈ 186 nm\n\nWhich is close to option D: 186.62 nm!\n\nYes! This seems promising. Let me verify the calculation step by step.\n\nFirst, compute denominator: 2π * sin θ_i ≈ 6.283 * 0.9848 ≈ 6.187\n\nNumerator: δ * λ1 ≈ 2.875 * 400 nm ≈ 1150 nm\n\nTherefore, Δ ≈ 1150 / 6.187 ≈ 186 nm. Which is option D: 186.62 nm. This must be the correct answer!\n\nTherefore, the lateral displacement is approximately 186.62 nm, which is option D.\n\nBut let me check the phase shift δ again for accuracy. Earlier, I approximated δ as 2.875 radians. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nGiven r_p ≈ -0.964 + i * 0.263.\n\nThe phase δ is arctan(Im/Re) + π. Since Re = -0.964, Im = +0.263.\n\nCompute Im/Re = 0.263 / -0.964 ≈ -0.2728\n\narctan(-0.2728) ≈ -15.3 degrees, which is -0.267 radians.\n\nTherefore, δ = π - 0.267 ≈ 3.1416 - 0.267 ≈ 2.8746 radians, which is what I had.\n\nSo δ ≈ 2.8746 rad.\n\nNow, let's compute Δ precisely:\n\nΔ = δ * λ1 / (2π * sin θ_i)\n\nPlugging in:\n\nδ = 2.8746 rad\n\nλ1 = 400 nm\n\nsin θ_i = sin(80°) ≈ 0.984807753012208\n\nCompute denominator: 2π * 0.984807753 ≈ 6.1866\n\nNumerator: 2.8746 * 400 ≈ 1149.84 nm\n\nΔ ≈ 1149.84 / 6.1866 ≈ 185.9 nm, which rounds to 186 nm. Given the options, D is 186.62 nm, which is very close. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nTherefore, the lateral displacement is approximately 186.62 nm, option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
