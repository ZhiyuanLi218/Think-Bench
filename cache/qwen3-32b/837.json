I need to figure out the impact force of an egg falling from the 25th floor. Hmm. The egg is 50 grams, which is 0.05 kg. The collision time is 2 milliseconds, so that's 0.002 seconds. \n\nFirst, I remember that force is related to momentum change over time. The formula is F = Δp / Δt. So I need to find the change in momentum of the egg when it hits the ground. To do that, I need to find its velocity right before impact. \n\nBut how do I find the velocity? Well, the egg falls from a height. Assuming it starts from rest, I can use the equations of motion under gravity. But wait, how high is the 25th floor? I think each floor is about 3 meters, so 25 floors would be 25 * 3 = 75 meters. Let me check if that's a reasonable assumption. Yeah, I think residential buildings are usually around 3 meters per floor. So height h = 75 m.\n\nNow, using the kinematic equation: v² = u² + 2gh. Since initial velocity u is 0, v = sqrt(2gh). Let me calculate that. g is 9.8 m/s². So 2 * 9.8 * 75 = 19.6 * 75. Let me compute that. 20 * 75 is 1500, minus 0.4*75=30, so 1500 - 30 = 1470. So v = sqrt(1470). Let me approximate sqrt(1470). Well, sqrt(1444) is 38, sqrt(1600) is 40. 1470 is 26 more than 1444. So maybe around 38.3 m/s? Let me check with a calculator. Wait, 38^2 is 1444, 38.3^2 is 38^2 + 2*38*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 1444 + 22.8 + 0.09 = 1466.89. Hmm, but we have 1470. So maybe 38.35 m/s? Let's say approximately 38.4 m/s. So velocity just before impact is roughly 38.4 m/s.\n\nNow, the momentum change Δp is mΔv. Assuming the egg comes to rest, so the change in velocity is from -v to 0 (assuming upward is positive, but direction might not matter here since we are taking magnitude). So Δp = m*v. So mass is 0.05 kg, so 0.05 kg * 38.4 m/s = 1.92 kg·m/s.\n\nThen the force is Δp / Δt. Δt is 0.002 seconds. So 1.92 / 0.002 = 960 N. So approximately 960 N. Looking at the options, option C is 10^3 N, which is 1000 N. So the closest answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did everything right. Did I account for direction? Well, since force is a vector, but we're just calculating magnitude here. Also, is there any air resistance? The problem probably assumes no air resistance because it's not mentioned. Also, maybe the collision time is approximate. If my calculation gives 960 N, which is about 10^3 N. So answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the height? Let me check again. 25 floors. If each floor is 3 meters, that's 75 m. But maybe in reality, the height is less? For example, maybe 2.5 meters per floor? Then 25 floors would be 62.5 m. Let me see. Let's try with h = 62.5 m. Then v² = 2 * 9.8 * 62.5 = 19.6 * 62.5. 20 * 62.5 = 1250, minus 0.4*62.5=25, so 1225. So v = sqrt(1225) = 35 m/s. Then momentum is 0.05 * 35 = 1.75 kg·m/s. Then force is 1.75 / 0.002 = 875 N. Still around 875 N, which is still closer to 10^3 N (1000) than 10^2 (100). So answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the egg might not be in free fall the entire time? But unless there's some other factor, I think the standard approach is to use the kinematic equations. Also, maybe the collision time is not just the time to stop, but the problem says collision time is approximately 2 ms. So I think the calculation is okay. So I think the answer is C.\n</think>"}
