The problem is about an electric heater connected to a DC power source and then to an AC power source. We need to find the maximum voltage of the AC source based on the power consumed in each case. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that power in electrical devices depends on the voltage and resistance. For DC, the power is straightforward, right? The formula is P = V² / R. Since the heater's resistance is constant, we can use that.\n\nSo when connected to 10 V DC, the power is P. Then, when connected to an AC source, the power is 0.5P. The question is about the maximum voltage (which I think is the peak voltage) of the AC source. \n\nBut wait, AC voltage is usually given as RMS (root mean square) when they talk about standard voltages. For example, the household voltage is 120 V RMS in some countries. The RMS value is what's used to calculate power because it's equivalent to the DC value that would deliver the same power. \n\nSo if the AC source is a sine wave, the relationship between peak voltage (V_peak) and RMS voltage (V_rms) is V_rms = V_peak / √2. Therefore, V_peak = V_rms * √2. \n\nBut here, the problem says when connected to the AC source, the power is half of what it is with DC. Let me write down the equations.\n\nFor DC: P = V_DC² / R. Given that V_DC is 10 V, so P = (10)^2 / R = 100 / R.\n\nFor AC: Power is 0.5P. Assuming that the AC voltage given is the RMS value, then the AC power would be P_AC = (V_AC_rms)^2 / R. \n\nAccording to the problem, P_AC = 0.5P. Therefore:\n\n(V_AC_rms)^2 / R = 0.5 * (100 / R)\n\nMultiplying both sides by R:\n\n(V_AC_rms)^2 = 0.5 * 100 = 50\n\nTherefore, V_AC_rms = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07 V. \n\nBut the question asks for the maximum output voltage of the AC power source, which is the peak voltage. Since V_peak = V_rms * √2, so:\n\nV_peak = sqrt(50) * √2 = sqrt(50 * 2) = sqrt(100) = 10 V.\n\nWait, so the peak voltage would be 10 V? But that's the same as the DC voltage. However, the power with AC is half. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal DC power is 100/R. The AC power is 0.5P, which is 50/R. So solving for V_AC_rms squared over R equals 50/R, so V_AC_rms squared is 50. Therefore V_AC_rms is sqrt(50) ≈7.07 V. Then peak voltage is sqrt(50)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(100) = 10 V. So the peak voltage is 10 V. Therefore, the answer is option C, 10 V? But let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\n(A) 5 V\n\n(B) 5√2 V ≈7.07 V\n\n(C) 10 V\n\n(D) 10√2 V ≈14.14 V\n\nBut according to my calculation, the peak voltage is 10 V. But why is the power only half? Because when you compare the RMS voltages. The DC voltage is 10 V, which is equivalent to an AC RMS voltage of 10 V. If the AC RMS was 10 V, then the power would be same as DC. But in this case, the AC power is half. Therefore, the RMS voltage must be lower. Let me check numbers again.\n\nOriginal DC: 10 V, power P.\n\nAC power is 0.5P. So if P_AC = (V_AC_rms^2)/R = 0.5*(100/R) => V_AC_rms^2 = 50 => V_AC_rms = sqrt(50) ≈7.07 V. Therefore, peak voltage is 7.07 * 1.414 ≈10 V. Exactly 10 V. Because sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2). Let me do that algebra again:\n\nsqrt(50) = sqrt(25*2) = 5*sqrt(2). Therefore, V_peak = 5*sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 5*2 = 10 V. Yes, exactly. So the maximum voltage is 10 V. Therefore, option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose the AC source has a peak voltage of 10 V. Then its RMS voltage is 10 / sqrt(2) ≈7.07 V. Then the power would be (7.07)^2 / R = 50 / R. Which is half of 100/R. Which is 0.5P. So that's exactly the case here. Therefore, the maximum voltage of the AC is 10 V. Therefore, answer is C. \n\nBut let me check why option B is 5√2. If someone thought that the RMS is 5√2, then peak would be 5√2 * √2 = 10. Wait, no. If the RMS voltage is 5√2, then peak is 5√2 * √2 = 5*2=10. Wait, so if someone thought that the RMS voltage was 5√2, which is approximately 7.07 V, which is correct, but if the question is asking for the maximum voltage, which is 10 V. Therefore, answer C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might confuse RMS and peak. For example, if they thought that since power is half, then the voltage is sqrt(0.5) times DC voltage, which is 10*sqrt(0.5)= 10/√2=5√2≈7.07 V, and that is the peak voltage. But that would be wrong because that value is actually the RMS. So if you take that as peak, then you would think RMS is 5√2 /√2=5 V. Then power would be 5²/R=25/R, which is 0.25P, which is not 0.5P. Therefore, that is wrong. Therefore, the correct way is that the 5√2 is the RMS voltage here. Therefore, peak is 5√2 * √2=10 V. Therefore, answer is C.\n\nBut let me check once again. \n\nGiven:\n\nP_DC = V_DC²/R = 10²/R = 100/R.\n\nP_AC = 0.5 * P_DC = 50/R.\n\nP_AC = V_RMS²/R => V_RMS² = 50 => V_RMS = sqrt(50) = 5*sqrt(2) ≈7.07 V.\n\nV_peak = V_RMS * sqrt(2) = 5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 5*2 = 10 V. \n\nYes, so the maximum voltage (peak) is 10 V. Therefore, answer is C. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are (A) 5 V, (B) 5√2 V, (C) 10 V, (D) 10√2 V. So answer C. \n\nBut wait, I have a doubt because sometimes in some contexts, people might directly relate the peak voltage to power. Let me think. Power is proportional to V_rms squared, not peak. So if you have a sine wave, the average power depends on V_rms. So even if the peak is 10 V, since V_rms is 10 / sqrt(2), but in our case, the V_rms is 5*sqrt(2), which is less than 10 V. So the peak is 10 V. \n\nAlternatively, if the AC source had a peak voltage of 10 V, then its RMS is 10 / sqrt(2) ≈7.07 V, which is exactly the V_rms we found. Therefore, the given AC source has a peak voltage of 10 V. Therefore, answer C. \n\nBut why is option B there? If someone thought that the RMS voltage is 5√2, which is correct, but thought that this is the peak voltage, then they would choose B. But no, 5√2 is the RMS. The peak is higher. Therefore, answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a different perspective. Let me check the math again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor DC: P = V_dc² / R.\n\nFor AC: P' = (V_ac_rms²)/ R = 0.5 P.\n\nTherefore, V_ac_rms² = 0.5 V_dc² => V_ac_rms = V_dc / sqrt(2) = 10 / 1.414 ≈7.07 V. Which is 10 / sqrt(2) = 5*sqrt(2). Because 10/sqrt(2) rationalized is (10*sqrt(2))/2 = 5*sqrt(2). So V_ac_rms is 5√2. Therefore, the peak voltage is 5√2 * sqrt(2) = 5*2=10. Therefore, answer is C. \n\nYes, so the maximum voltage is 10 V. Therefore, the answer is C. \n\nBut let me check once more with actual numbers. Suppose R is 10 ohms. Then DC power is 10^2 / 10 = 10 W. Then AC power is 5 W. For AC, 5 W = V_rms² / 10 => V_rms² = 50 => V_rms = sqrt(50) ≈7.07 V. Then peak voltage is 7.07 * 1.414 ≈10 V. Yep. So that works. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) 10 V. \n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes when dealing with AC and DC power, the peak-to-peak or peak values can be tricky. Let me think again. The key here is that power in AC depends on the RMS voltage. So regardless of the waveform (as long as it's a sine wave here), the RMS is what determines the power. So the question says \"sine wave AC power source\". Therefore, the relation between peak and RMS is fixed. \n\nSo the answer is C. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
