Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the spin of an electron is a quantum mechanical property, and its time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The magnetic field will cause the spin to precess, right? Since the magnetic field is along the z-axis, the spin should precess around the z-axis. But how does that affect the expectation value of S_x?\n\nLet me recall the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field. The Hamiltonian should be something like H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But for an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio is related to the Bohr magneton. However, maybe I can just work with the general form here. Since the magnetic field is along the z-direction, H = -γ B_0 S_z, where B_0 is the magnitude of the magnetic field. Wait, but electrons have a negative charge, so maybe there's a negative sign? Let me check. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ · B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is proportional to its spin, μ = -g_s (μ_B/ħ) S, where g_s is the electron g-factor (approximately 2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So putting it all together, H = g_s (μ_B / ħ) B · S. But maybe for simplicity, I can just take H proportional to S_z, since B is along z. The exact proportionality constant might not matter if I'm just looking for the expectation value's time dependence, because the time evolution will depend on the energy difference between the spin-up and spin-down states.\n\nBut maybe I need to be more precise. Let me write the Hamiltonian as H = ω S_z, where ω is some frequency proportional to the magnetic field strength. Wait, actually, the energy difference between spin-up and spin-down is ΔE = ħ ω, so H would be something like ħ ω S_z / ħ = ω S_z? Wait, no. Let me think again. The time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation iħ ∂/∂t |ψ> = H |ψ>. So if H = ω S_z, then the time evolution operator would be U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(-i ω S_z t / ħ). But S_z is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_z. Let me write S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. Therefore, H = ω (ħ/2) σ_z. Then the time evolution operator is exp(-i ω (ħ/2) σ_z t / ħ) = exp(-i ω σ_z t / 2). So that simplifies to exp(-i (ω t / 2) σ_z). \n\nBut maybe I should use the standard approach for spin precession. The time evolution of spin states in a magnetic field is similar to Larmor precession. The spin will precess around the direction of the magnetic field, which is the z-axis here. So if the initial spin is along y, then over time, it should precess in the x-y plane? Wait, if the magnetic field is along z, then the spin precesses around z. So if initially it's along y, then after some time, it will rotate towards x and then back? So the expectation value of S_x should oscillate sinusoidally?\n\nBut I need to calculate this properly. Let me recall that the time evolution of the expectation value of spin can be found using the Heisenberg equation of motion or by evolving the state vector in the Schrödinger picture and then taking the expectation value.\n\nLet me try the Schrödinger picture approach. First, I need to find the initial state of the electron. At t=0, the spin is measured to be along the positive y-direction. So the initial state |ψ(0)> is the eigenstate of S_y with eigenvalue +ħ/2.\n\nThe spin operators can be represented in terms of Pauli matrices:\n\nS_x = (ħ/2) σ_x,\n\nS_y = (ħ/2) σ_y,\n\nS_z = (ħ/2) σ_z,\n\nwhere σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices:\n\nσ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]],\n\nσ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]],\n\nσ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n\nSo the eigenstates of S_y. Let me recall that the eigenstates of σ_y with eigenvalue +1 are (1/√2)[1, i]^T and for -1 is (1/√2)[1, -i]^T. Therefore, the eigenstate of S_y with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is |+y> = (1/√2)[1, i]^T.\n\nTherefore, the initial state is |ψ(0)> = |+y> = (1/√2)[1, i]^T.\n\nNow, I need to find the time evolution of this state under the Hamiltonian H. As mentioned earlier, H is proportional to S_z. Let me define the Hamiltonian as H = ω S_z, where ω is the Larmor frequency. However, to be precise, the energy is related to the magnetic field. But maybe I can just keep it as H = ω S_z for simplicity. The exact value of ω might not be necessary for finding the time dependence of the expectation value, since it would just set the frequency of oscillation.\n\nBut let me check. The actual Hamiltonian for an electron in a magnetic field B along z is H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For an electron, γ = -g_s μ_B / ħ, where g_s ≈ 2, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But since the electron has negative charge, the magnetic moment is opposite to the spin. However, the exact value might not be necessary here. Since the problem is about the average polarization, which is proportional to the expectation value of S_x, and they just want the average polarization, so maybe the proportionality constant is not required. But perhaps I need to include factors of ħ and such.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the general form of the time evolution. Let me proceed with H = ω S_z. Let me define ω such that H = ħ ω S_z / (ħ/2) ??? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me write H = -γ B_0 S_z. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i γ B_0 S_z t / ħ). Since S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z, substituting gives U(t) = exp(i γ B_0 (ħ/2) σ_z t / ħ) = exp(i (γ B_0 t / 2) σ_z). So the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(i (γ B_0 t / 2) σ_z). However, since γ is negative for the electron, this would introduce a negative sign. But since we are dealing with the time evolution of the state, the overall phase might not matter, but relative phases do.\n\nBut perhaps I can just define ω = γ B_0, so H = -ω S_z? Wait, no. Let me not get bogged down here. Let me just proceed with H = ω S_z. The exact value of ω will determine the frequency, but since the question is about the average polarization, which is proportional to <S_x>, maybe the answer is sinusoidal with some frequency, and the question just wants the form. But maybe I need to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Heisenberg picture. The expectation value of S_x at time t is <ψ(0)| U† S_x U |ψ(0)>, where U is the time evolution operator. Alternatively, in the Heisenberg picture, S_x(t) = U† S_x U, and then the expectation value is <S_x(t)> = <ψ(0)| S_x(t) |ψ(0)>.\n\nBut since the time evolution is generated by H = ω S_z, the Heisenberg equation for S_x would be dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x]. Let me compute that. [H, S_x] = [ω S_z, S_x] = ω [S_z, S_x] = ω i ħ S_y. Therefore, dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)(ω i ħ S_y) ) = i^2 ω S_y = -ω S_y. Similarly, dS_y/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_y] = (i/ħ)[ω S_z, S_y] = (i/ħ)(ω [S_z, S_y]) = (i/ħ)(ω (-i ħ S_x)) ) = ω S_x. And dS_z/dt = 0, since [H, S_z] = 0.\n\nSo we have the equations:\n\ndS_x/dt = -ω S_y,\n\ndS_y/dt = ω S_x,\n\ndS_z/dt = 0.\n\nThese are the equations of a harmonic oscillator. Let me write them as a system:\n\nd/dt [S_x; S_y; S_z] = [ -ω S_y; ω S_x; 0 ].\n\nThis is similar to precession around the z-axis. If I think of the vector S = (S_x, S_y, S_z), then its time derivative is ω S × ê_z, where ê_z is the unit vector along z. Therefore, the spin vector is precessing around the z-axis with angular frequency ω.\n\nGiven that, if the initial spin is along the positive y-direction, then as time evolves, the spin will precess around the z-axis. So initially, S_x = 0, S_y = ħ/2, S_z = 0. Then as time goes on, S_x will become positive, reach a maximum when the spin is along x, then go back to zero, become negative, etc. So the expectation value of S_x should be sinusoidal, starting at zero, with amplitude ħ/2, and angular frequency ω.\n\nTherefore, <S_x(t)> = (ħ/2) sin(ω t). But wait, let me check the equations. Let me solve the differential equations.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\ndS_x/dt = -ω S_y,\n\ndS_y/dt = ω S_x.\n\nThis is a system of linear differential equations. Let me differentiate the first equation:\n\nd²S_x/dt² = -ω dS_y/dt = -ω (ω S_x) = -ω² S_x.\n\nTherefore, d²S_x/dt² + ω² S_x = 0. The solution is S_x(t) = A cos(ω t) + B sin(ω t). Similarly for S_y(t).\n\nGiven the initial conditions at t=0: S_x(0) = 0, S_y(0) = ħ/2.\n\nFrom S_x(0) = A cos(0) + B sin(0) = A = 0. Therefore, A=0. Then S_x(t) = B sin(ω t). To find B, note that from dS_x/dt = B ω cos(ω t) = -ω S_y(t). Therefore, S_y(t) = -B cos(ω t). At t=0, S_y(0) = -B = ħ/2, so B = -ħ/2. Therefore, S_x(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t). Wait, but that would give S_x(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t). However, let me check the sign.\n\nFrom dS_x/dt = -ω S_y(t). At t=0, dS_x/dt = -ω S_y(0) = -ω (ħ/2). On the other hand, dS_x/dt at t=0 is also B ω. Since S_x(t) = B sin(ω t), then dS_x/dt = B ω cos(ω t). At t=0, this is B ω. Therefore, B ω = -ω (ħ/2) => B = - ħ/2. Therefore, S_x(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t). However, this seems to suggest that initially, S_x(t) is negative? But if the spin is precessing around the z-axis from the positive y-direction, then at t=0+, the direction of precession (clockwise or counterclockwise) depends on the sign of ω. \n\nWait, let me think physically. If the magnetic field is along z, and the spin is initially along y, then the torque on the spin would cause it to precess. The direction of precession depends on the sign of the gyromagnetic ratio. For an electron, which has a negative charge, the precession should be clockwise when viewed along the direction of the magnetic field (z-axis). Let me recall the right-hand rule. The torque τ = μ × B. Since μ is opposite to S for the electron, τ = -γ S × B. If B is along +z, and S is along +y, then S × B is along +x (since y cross z is x). Therefore, τ is along -x. Torque is also dS/dt. So dS/dt is along -x. Therefore, the derivative of S at t=0 is along -x. That means that S starts to decrease in y and increase in -x direction? Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the equations.\n\nAlternatively, from the solution S_x(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t). At t=0+, sin(ω t) ~ ω t, so S_x(t) ~ - (ħ/2) ω t. So negative x-direction. But if the spin is precessing clockwise around z, starting from +y, then moving towards -x? Let me visualize: if you have a vector in the y-direction and it precesses clockwise around z, then yes, the next position would be towards -x. So that would mean that the x-component is negative initially. So the solution S_x(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t) seems correct.\n\nBut the question asks for the average polarization along the x-direction for t>0. So the expectation value <S_x(t)> is - (ħ/2) sin(ω t). However, polarization is often defined as the expectation value of the spin, so maybe they just want the magnitude? Wait, no, the average polarization is proportional to the expectation value, so the negative sign is important. But maybe the question is expecting a positive amplitude? Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, the sign of ω depends on the sign of the gyromagnetic ratio. Let me recall that for an electron, the magnetic moment is μ = -g_s (μ_B / ħ) S. Therefore, the Hamiltonian H = -μ · B = g_s (μ_B / ħ) B · S. So if B is along z, H = g_s (μ_B / ħ) B_0 S_z. Then the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ). Therefore, substituting H:\n\nU(t) = exp( -i g_s (μ_B / ħ) B_0 S_z t / ħ )\n\nBut S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z, so:\n\nU(t) = exp( -i g_s (μ_B / ħ) B_0 (ħ/2) σ_z t / ħ ) = exp( -i g_s μ_B B_0 t σ_z / (2 ħ) )\n\nBut g_s is about 2, μ_B is eħ/(2m_e), so let's compute the coefficient:\n\ng_s μ_B / ħ ≈ 2 * (eħ/(2m_e)) / ħ ) = e/m_e.\n\nBut maybe I don't need the exact value. Let me define ω = g_s μ_B B_0 / ħ. Therefore, H = ħ ω S_z / (ħ/2) ??? Wait, no. Wait, H = g_s μ_B B_0 S_z / ħ. Since μ_B = eħ/(2m_e), then H = g_s (eħ/(2m_e)) B_0 S_z / ħ = g_s e B_0 S_z / (2 m_e). Therefore, ω = g_s e B_0 / (2 m_e). But regardless, the important thing is that ω is positive. Therefore, in the previous equations, the equations of motion lead to S_x(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t). However, if the precession is clockwise, then maybe the frequency should be negative? Wait, no. The sign of ω in the equations depends on the sign of the Hamiltonian. If H = ħ ω S_z, then ω is positive, but for the electron, the Hamiltonian is H = positive constant times S_z. Therefore, the equations of motion would have the same sign as before, leading to clockwise precession when viewed along +z. However, the mathematical solution is S_x(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t). So if I plot this, it starts at 0, goes negative, reaches -ħ/2 at t= 3π/2? Wait, no, sin(ω t) starts at 0, goes to 1 at π/2, so - (ħ/2) sin(ω t) starts at 0, goes to -ħ/2 at π/2. Which would correspond to clockwise precession? Let me think again. If the spin is precessing clockwise around z, starting at +y, then at t=π/(2ω), it would be at -x. So <S_x> would be -ħ/2, which matches the solution. Then at t=π/ω, it would be at -y, then at t=3π/(2ω), +x, and so on. Therefore, the solution S_x(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t) is correct.\n\nBut the question says \"average polarization along the x direction for t>0 (proportional to the expectation value of S_x)\". So the answer is proportional to -sin(ω t). However, maybe the question is expecting a positive amplitude? Let me check my initial state again.\n\nWait, the initial state was |+y> = (1/√2)[1, i]^T. Let me confirm that. The eigenstates of S_y are obtained by solving (S_y - λ I) |ψ> = 0. For λ = +ħ/2, the matrix S_y - λ I is:\n\n(ħ/2) σ_y - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2)[σ_y - I] = (ħ/2)[ [ -1, -i ], [ i, -1 ] ].\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we get equations:\n\n-ψ_1 - i ψ_2 = 0,\n\ni ψ_1 - ψ_2 = 0.\n\nFrom the first equation: ψ_1 = -i ψ_2. Let me take ψ_2 = 1, then ψ_1 = -i. Therefore, the eigenvector is [-i, 1]^T. Normalizing, the norm squared is (-i)^2 + 1^2 = (-1) + 1 = 0? Wait no, norm squared is | -i |² + |1|² = 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, normalized eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ] / √2. Which can be written as (1/√2)[1, i]^T if we multiply numerator and denominator by i. Let me check: [ -i, 1 ] multiplied by i is [ (-i)(i), 1*(i) ] = [ 1, i ]. Therefore, yes, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[1, i]^T. Therefore, the initial state is correct.\n\nNow, let me evolve this state under the time evolution operator. Let me write the time evolution operator again. Assuming H = ω S_z, then U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(-i ω S_z t / ħ). Since S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z, then:\n\nU(t) = exp( -i ω (ħ/2) σ_z t / ħ ) = exp( -i ω σ_z t / 2 )\n\nTherefore, the time evolution operator is:\n\nU(t) = [ exp(-i ω t / 2), 0; 0, exp(i ω t / 2) ]\n\nTherefore, applying this to the initial state |ψ(0)> = (1/√2)[1, i]^T:\n\n|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-i ω t / 2), 0; 0, exp(i ω t / 2) ] [1; i] = (1/√2)[ exp(-i ω t / 2), i exp(i ω t / 2) ]^T.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\nFirst component: (1/√2) exp(-i ω t / 2),\n\nSecond component: (i / √2) exp(i ω t / 2).\n\nNow, to compute the expectation value of S_x, which is (ħ/2) <ψ(t)| σ_x |ψ(t)>.\n\nσ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so:\n\n<σ_x> = [first component* , second component*] σ_x [first component; second component]\n\n= first component* * second component + second component* * first component.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst component* is (1/√2) exp(i ω t / 2),\n\nSecond component* is (-i / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2),\n\nWait, because the second component is (i / √2) exp(i ω t / 2), so its complex conjugate is (-i / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2).\n\nTherefore:\n\n<σ_x> = [ (1/√2) exp(i ω t / 2) ] * [ (i / √2) exp(i ω t / 2) ] + [ (-i / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2) ] * [ (1 / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2) ].\n\nWait no, σ_x multiplied by the vector [first; second] gives [second; first], so the inner product is [first* second + second* first]. Therefore:\n\n<σ_x> = first* * second + second* * first.\n\nFirst* is (1/√2) exp(i ω t / 2),\n\nSecond is (i / √2) exp(i ω t / 2),\n\nTherefore, first* * second is (1/√2)(i / √2) exp(i ω t / 2) exp(i ω t / 2) = (i / 2) exp(i ω t).\n\nSimilarly, second* is (-i / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2),\n\nFirst is (1 / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2),\n\nSo second* * first is (-i / √2)(1 / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2) exp(-i ω t / 2) = (-i / 2) exp(-i ω t).\n\nTherefore, adding these two terms:\n\n<σ_x> = (i / 2) exp(i ω t) + (-i / 2) exp(-i ω t) = (i / 2)[ exp(i ω t) - exp(-i ω t) ] = i / 2 [ 2i sin(ω t) ] = i^2 sin(ω t) = - sin(ω t).\n\nTherefore, <σ_x> = - sin(ω t). Therefore, the expectation value of S_x is (ħ/2) <σ_x> = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t), which matches the previous result from solving the differential equations.\n\nTherefore, the average polarization along the x-direction is proportional to -sin(ω t). However, the problem says \"proportional to the expectation value of S_x\", so maybe they just want the functional form, which is sinusoidal. But let me check if there's a missing negative sign or something.\n\nBut let me think again about the physical meaning. If the spin is precessing clockwise around the z-axis starting from +y, then the x-component should start at 0, go negative, reach -ħ/2 at t=π/(2ω), then back to 0 at t=π/ω, then positive ħ/2 at t=3π/(2ω), etc. So the sinusoidal function is indeed -sin(ω t). However, depending on the definition of the frequency ω, the sign might be different. For example, if ω was defined with a negative sign, then it would be positive sine. But given that we derived it with the standard Hamiltonian, the negative sign is correct.\n\nBut let me check once again with another approach. Suppose I use the time evolution of the state and compute <S_x>.\n\nWe found that |ψ(t)> = (1/√2)[ exp(-i ω t / 2), i exp(i ω t / 2) ]^T.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nFirst component: (1/√2) e^{-i ω t / 2},\n\nSecond component: (i / √2) e^{i ω t / 2}.\n\nLet me write the second component as (i / √2) e^{i ω t / 2} = (1 / √2) e^{i (ω t / 2 + π/2)}.\n\nTherefore, the state can be written as:\n\n(1/√2) e^{-i ω t / 2} |↑> + (1/√2) e^{i (ω t / 2 + π/2)} |↓>.\n\nBut maybe I can factor out some phase. Let me write:\n\n|ψ(t)> = e^{-i ω t / 2} [ (1/√2)|↑> + (i / √2) e^{i ω t} |↓> ].\n\nBut the global phase e^{-i ω t / 2} doesn't affect the expectation value. Therefore, effectively, the state is:\n\n(1/√2)|↑> + (i / √2) e^{i ω t} |↓>.\n\nNow, to compute <S_x>, which is (ħ/2)(<↑| + <↓| (-i)) [ ... ] [ ... ] (|↑> + i e^{i ω t} |↓>).\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value using the state. Alternatively, we can think in terms of the Bloch sphere. The initial state is along +y. The time evolution under H = ω S_z corresponds to rotation around the z-axis with angular frequency ω. Therefore, the state at time t is the initial state rotated by angle -ω t around the z-axis (since the rotation operator is exp(-i ω S_z t / ħ), which for spin-1/2 is a rotation by angle -ω t around z). Therefore, rotating the +y direction by -ω t around z would bring it to some point on the equator of the Bloch sphere. The x-component would be sin(ω t), but with a sign depending on the direction of rotation.\n\nWait, rotation around z by angle θ is given by R_z(θ) = exp(-i θ S_z / ħ). For our case, θ = ω t. However, since S_z is (ħ/2) σ_z, the rotation is R_z(θ) = exp(-i θ σ_z / 2). The rotation of a state around z by θ changes the angles on the Bloch sphere. The initial state is along +y, which corresponds to angles θ = π/2, φ = π/2. Rotating this by -θ around z would change the azimuthal angle φ by -θ. So the new φ is π/2 - θ. The x-component of the polarization is proportional to sin(θ_polar) cos(φ), where θ_polar is the polar angle. Since the initial state is on the equator (θ_polar = π/2), after rotation, θ_polar remains π/2, and φ becomes π/2 - θ. Therefore, the x-component is cos(φ) = cos(π/2 - θ) = sin(θ). But θ here is the rotation angle, which is ω t. Therefore, the x-component is sin(ω t). However, earlier calculations gave -sin(ω t). There's a discrepancy in sign here. Why?\n\nBecause the rotation direction? If the rotation is by -θ around z, then the azimuthal angle decreases by θ. Starting from φ = π/2, going to φ = π/2 - θ. The x-component is sin(π/2 - θ) = cos(θ)? Wait no, the x-component is proportional to cos(φ) when polar angle is π/2. Wait, if the polar angle is π/2, then the coordinates on the Bloch sphere are (sin(π/2) cos φ, sin(π/2) sin φ, cos(π/2)) = (cos φ, sin φ, 0). Therefore, the x-component is cos φ. If φ becomes π/2 - θ, then cos(φ) = cos(π/2 - θ) = sin θ. Therefore, the x-component is sin θ = sin(ω t). But earlier calculations gave -sin(ω t). Where is the mistake?\n\nThis suggests that the expectation value of S_x should be positive sin(ω t), but earlier calculation gave -sin(ω t). Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check with specific time. Let me take t such that ω t = π/2. According to the Bloch sphere argument, the x-component should be sin(π/2) = 1, so positive. But according to our previous calculation, <S_x> = - (ħ/2) sin(ω t) = - (ħ/2). But according to the Bloch sphere, it should be + (ħ/2). Contradiction! Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous calculation.\n\nWait, let's recast the previous calculation. Earlier, I found <σ_x> = - sin(ω t). But according to the Bloch sphere, it should be + sin(ω t). Therefore, there's a sign error. Let me go back to the calculation where I computed <σ_x>.\n\nI had:\n\n<σ_x> = first* * second + second* * first.\n\nFirst component: (1/√2) exp(-i ω t / 2),\n\nSecond component: (i / √2) exp(i ω t / 2).\n\nTherefore, first* * second = (1/√2) exp(i ω t / 2) * (i / √2) exp(i ω t / 2) = i / 2 exp(i ω t).\n\nSimilarly, second* * first = (-i / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2) * (1 / √2) exp(-i ω t / 2) = -i / 2 exp(-i ω t).\n\nTherefore, adding them:\n\ni / 2 exp(i ω t) - i / 2 exp(-i ω t) = i / 2 [exp(i ω t) - exp(-i ω t)] = i / 2 * 2i sin(ω t) = i^2 sin(ω t) = - sin(ω t). \n\nBut according to the Bloch sphere, it should be + sin(ω t). Where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! The problem is in the definition of the rotation direction. In the Bloch sphere, the rotation operator exp(-i θ S_z / ħ) corresponds to a rotation by angle θ around the z-axis, but depending on the convention, it might be clockwise or counterclockwise. Let me recall that for spin-1/2, the rotation operator R_z(θ) = exp(-i θ S_z / ħ) corresponds to a rotation of the state by θ radians around the z-axis. However, the direction of rotation depends on the convention. For example, in the Bloch sphere, a rotation generated by S_z is such that increasing θ rotates the state clockwise when looking along the positive z-axis. \n\nBut when we rotate the state |+y> by θ around z, the azimuthal angle φ decreases by θ, leading to the x-component being sin(θ). However, according to our calculation, the expectation value is -sin(θ). Therefore, there is a discrepancy. Why?\n\nWait, perhaps the definition of the Hamiltonian had an incorrect sign. Let me check the time evolution operator again. The time evolution is given by U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). If H = ω S_z, then U(t) = exp(-i ω S_z t / ħ). But S_z is (ħ/2) σ_z, so:\n\nU(t) = exp(-i ω (ħ/2) σ_z t / ħ) = exp(-i ω σ_z t / 2). \n\nThis operator corresponds to a rotation around the z-axis by angle -ω t, because the standard rotation operator is exp(-i θ σ_z / 2) for rotation by θ around z. Therefore, if θ = -ω t, then the rotation is by -ω t, i.e., clockwise when looking along positive z-axis. Therefore, rotating the initial +y state by -ω t around z brings it to a position where the azimuthal angle decreases by ω t. Therefore, as before, the x-component is sin(ω t). But according to the calculation, it's -sin(ω t). \n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the calculation. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nLet me re-express the state |ψ(t)>:\n\nFirst component: (1/√2) e^{-i ω t / 2},\n\nSecond component: (i / √2) e^{i ω t / 2}.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n|ψ(t)> = [e^{-i ω t / 2}, i e^{i ω t / 2}] / √2.\n\nLet me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me take ω t = φ for simplicity.\n\nThen:\n\nFirst component: (cos(φ/2) - i sin(φ/2)) / √2,\n\nSecond component: i [cos(φ/2) + i sin(φ/2)] / √2 = [i cos(φ/2) - sin(φ/2)] / √2.\n\nTherefore, writing the state as:\n\n[cos(φ/2) - i sin(φ/2), i cos(φ/2) - sin(φ/2)] / √2.\n\nNow, let me compute the expectation value of σ_x, which is first* * second + second* * first.\n\nFirst*, the complex conjugate of the first component, is [cos(φ/2) + i sin(φ/2)] / √2.\n\nSecond component is [i cos(φ/2) - sin(φ/2)] / √2.\n\nSo first* * second is [cos(φ/2) + i sin(φ/2)] [i cos(φ/2) - sin(φ/2)] / 2.\n\nLet me multiply this out:\n\ncos(φ/2) * i cos(φ/2) = i cos²(φ/2),\n\ncos(φ/2) * (-sin(φ/2)) = -cos(φ/2) sin(φ/2),\n\ni sin(φ/2) * i cos(φ/2) = i² sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2) = - sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2),\n\ni sin(φ/2) * (-sin(φ/2)) = -i sin²(φ/2).\n\nAdding these terms together:\n\ni cos²(φ/2) - cos(φ/2) sin(φ/2) - sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2) - i sin²(φ/2)\n\n= i [cos²(φ/2) - sin²(φ/2)] - 2 cos(φ/2) sin(φ/2)\n\n= i cos(φ) - sin(φ).\n\nSimilarly, second* * first is the complex conjugate of first* * second. Since first* * second is [i cos²(φ/2) - ...] as above, its complex conjugate would be -i cos²(φ/2) - ... Wait no, let me compute second* * first.\n\nSecond* is the complex conjugate of the second component: [-i cos(φ/2) - sin(φ/2)] / √2.\n\nFirst component is [cos(φ/2) - i sin(φ/2)] / √2.\n\nSo second* * first is [-i cos(φ/2) - sin(φ/2)] [cos(φ/2) - i sin(φ/2)] / 2.\n\nLet me multiply this out:\n\n-i cos(φ/2) * cos(φ/2) = -i cos²(φ/2),\n\n-i cos(φ/2) * (-i sin(φ/2)) = -i^2 cos(φ/2) sin(φ/2) = cos(φ/2) sin(φ/2),\n\n-sin(φ/2) * cos(φ/2) = -cos(φ/2) sin(φ/2),\n\n-sin(φ/2) * (-i sin(φ/2)) = i sin²(φ/2).\n\nAdding these terms:\n\n-i cos²(φ/2) + cos(φ/2) sin(φ/2) - cos(φ/2) sin(φ/2) + i sin²(φ/2)\n\n= -i cos²(φ/2) + i sin²(φ/2)\n\n= -i [cos²(φ/2) - sin²(φ/2)]\n\n= -i cos(φ).\n\nTherefore, total <σ_x> = first* * second + second* * first = [i cos(φ) - sin(φ)] + [-i cos(φ)] = - sin(φ). \n\nWait, so this still gives <σ_x> = - sin(φ) = - sin(ω t). But according to the Bloch sphere argument, it should be + sin(ω t). What's going on here?\n\nLet me check with φ = 0. At φ = 0, the state should be |+y>, and <σ_x> should be zero. Indeed, -sin(0) = 0. At φ = π/2, according to the Bloch sphere, the x-component should be sin(π/2) = 1, but our calculation gives -sin(π/2) = -1. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in either the Bloch sphere reasoning or the calculation.\n\nWait, let me think about the Bloch sphere again. If I rotate the state |+y> by -φ around the z-axis, what is the resulting state? Let me recall that the rotation operator R_z(-φ) acting on |+y> gives a new state. Let me compute this explicitly.\n\nThe rotation operator R_z(-φ) = exp(i φ σ_z / 2). Acting on |+y>, which is (|↑> + i |↓>)/√2.\n\nLet me compute R_z(-φ)|+y>:\n\nexp(i φ σ_z / 2) * (|↑> + i |↓>)/√2 = [exp(i φ/2)|↑> + exp(-i φ/2) i |↓>]/√2.\n\nWhich is the same as our |ψ(t)> with φ = ω t. Therefore, this state is as we calculated. Now, what is the expectation value of σ_x for this state?\n\nLet me compute it. Let me denote the state as |ψ> = [exp(i φ/2), i exp(-i φ/2)] / √2. Wait, no, earlier we had [exp(-i ω t / 2), i exp(i ω t / 2)] / √2, which is equivalent to φ = ω t, and with the rotation being R_z(-φ). Let me take φ = ω t for simplicity.\n\nSo the state is:\n\n[exp(i φ/2), i exp(-i φ/2)] / √2.\n\nWait, no, earlier when we set φ = ω t, we had:\n\nFirst component: exp(-i φ / 2) ? No, earlier we had for |ψ(t)>:\n\nFirst component: exp(-i ω t / 2) = exp(-i φ / 2),\n\nSecond component: i exp(i ω t / 2) = i exp(i φ / 2).\n\nTherefore, the state is:\n\n[exp(-i φ / 2), i exp(i φ / 2)] / √2.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nFirst component: e^{-i φ/2} / √2,\n\nSecond component: i e^{i φ/2} / √2.\n\nLet me compute <σ_x> for this state.\n\n<σ_x> = first* * second + second* * first.\n\nFirst* is e^{i φ/2} / √2,\n\nSecond is i e^{i φ/2} / √2,\n\nSo first* * second is e^{i φ/2} * i e^{i φ/2} / 2 = i e^{i φ} / 2.\n\nSecond* is -i e^{-i φ/2} / √2,\n\nFirst is e^{-i φ/2} / √2,\n\nSo second* * first is -i e^{-i φ/2} * e^{-i φ/2} / 2 = -i e^{-i φ} / 2.\n\nTherefore, total <σ_x> = i e^{i φ}/2 - i e^{-i φ}/2 = i/2 [e^{i φ} - e^{-i φ}] = i/2 * 2i sin φ = - sin φ.\n\nSo again, we get <σ_x> = - sin φ. But according to the Bloch sphere argument, it should be + sin φ. What is the problem?\n\nAh! The issue is in the definition of the rotation and the direction of the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian H = ω S_z causes the spin to precess around the z-axis, but for an electron, the magnetic moment is opposite to the spin, so the torque causes the spin to precess in the opposite direction compared to classical intuition. Wait, earlier we had the torque τ = μ × B, and since μ = -γ S, τ = -γ S × B. For the electron, γ is positive? Wait, let me recall that the gyromagnetic ratio γ for the electron is γ = -g_s μ_B / ħ, so it is negative. Therefore, τ = -γ S × B = g_s μ_B / ħ S × B. If B is along +z, and S is along +y, then S × B is +x, so τ is +x. Therefore, the torque is in the +x direction, which means dS/dt is in +x direction. Therefore, initially, the derivative of S is in +x direction, which would mean that the x-component starts increasing from 0. But our calculation shows that <S_x> starts as -sin(φ), which for small φ is -φ. This suggests a negative derivative at t=0, which contradicts the torque calculation. What is wrong here?\n\nLet me recast the torque equation. The torque is τ = dS/dt = γ S × B. Wait, no, earlier I said τ = -γ S × B. Let me check the correct relation. The Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B. The time derivative of S is given by the Heisenberg equation: dS/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S] + ...? Wait, no, in the Heisenberg picture, dA/dt = (i/ħ)[H, A] + ∂A/∂t. For the Schrödinger picture, the expectation value's time derivative is given by the same equation if the state is evolving. \n\nBut earlier, we derived that for H = ω S_z, the equations of motion are dS_x/dt = -ω S_y, dS_y/dt = ω S_x, which leads to precession. However, according to the torque equation, if H = -μ · B, then dS/dt = γ S × B. Let me see. If H = -μ · B, then the time derivative of S is given by dS/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S]. Let me compute [H, S]. H = -μ · B, and μ = γ S, so H = -γ B · S. Therefore, [H, S] = -γ [B · S, S]. Since B is along z, this is -γ B [S_z, S]. The commutator [S_z, S_x] = iħ S_y, [S_z, S_y] = -iħ S_x, [S_z, S_z] = 0. Therefore, [B · S, S] = B [S_z, S] = B ([S_z, S_x], [S_z, S_y], [S_z, S_z]) = B (iħ S_y, -iħ S_x, 0). Therefore, [H, S] = -γ B (iħ S_y, -iħ S_x, 0). Then dS/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S] = (i/ħ)(-γ B)(iħ S_y, -iħ S_x, 0) = -γ B ( -S_y, -S_x, 0 ) = γ B (S_y, S_x, 0 ) = γ B (S × B)/B² × B? Wait, let me see. If B is along z, then S × B = S_x B ŷ - S_y B x̂. Therefore, γ S × B = γ B (S_x ŷ - S_y x̂). But according to the previous result, dS/dt = γ B (S_y, S_x, 0). Comparing components:\n\ndS_x/dt = γ B S_y,\n\ndS_y/dt = -γ B S_x,\n\ndS_z/dt = 0.\n\nWait, this contradicts our previous equations of motion where we had dS_x/dt = -ω S_y, dS_y/dt = ω S_x. So there must be a sign discrepancy here. Where is the error?\n\nEarlier, we had H = ω S_z, and derived dS_x/dt = -ω S_y, dS_y/dt = ω S_x. But according to the torque equation, with H = -γ B · S, we have dS_x/dt = γ B S_y. So if we equate the two expressions, we have -ω S_y = γ B S_y => ω = -γ B. So there is a sign difference. This suggests that our initial assumption about the sign of H might be incorrect.\n\nLet me re-express. Let me define H = -γ B · S. Then, for B along z, H = -γ B S_z. Then, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i γ B S_z t / ħ). Let me define ω = γ B, so H = -ω S_z. Then U(t) = exp(i ω S_z t / ħ). With S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z, this becomes exp(i ω (ħ/2) σ_z t / ħ) = exp(i ω σ_z t / 2). This is different from what I had before, where I had U(t) = exp(-i ω σ_z t / 2). So previously, I had H = ω S_z, but now with H = -ω S_z, the time evolution is exp(i ω σ_z t / 2). This changes the previous calculation. Let me redo the calculation with this correct sign.\n\nLet me redefine ω = γ B, and H = -ω S_z. Then the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(i ω S_z t / ħ). With S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z, this becomes exp(i ω σ_z t / 2). Therefore, the time evolution operator is:\n\nU(t) = [[exp(i ω t / 2), 0], [0, exp(-i ω t / 2)]].\n\nApplying this to the initial state |+y> = (1/√2)[1, i]^T:\n\n|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+y> = (1/√2)[exp(i ω t / 2), i exp(-i ω t / 2)]^T.\n\nLet me compute <σ_x> for this state. The state is:\n\nFirst component: exp(i ω t / 2) / √2,\n\nSecond component: i exp(-i ω t / 2) / √2.\n\nFirst*, the complex conjugate of the first component: exp(-i ω t / 2) / √2,\n\nSecond component: i exp(-i ω t / 2) / √2,\n\nWait no, the second component is i exp(-i ω t / 2) / √2, so its complex conjugate is -i exp(i ω t / 2) / √2.\n\nTherefore, <σ_x> = first* * second + second* * first = [exp(-i ω t / 2)/√2][i exp(-i ω t / 2)/√2] + [-i exp(i ω t / 2)/√2][exp(i ω t / 2)/√2].\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: exp(-i ω t / 2) * i exp(-i ω t / 2) / 2 = i exp(-i ω t) / 2.\n\nSecond term: -i exp(i ω t / 2) * exp(i ω t / 2) / 2 = -i exp(i ω t) / 2.\n\nAdding them together: i exp(-i ω t)/2 - i exp(i ω t)/2 = i/2 [exp(-i ω t) - exp(i ω t)] = i/2 [ -2i sin(ω t) ] = sin(ω t).\n\nTherefore, <σ_x> = sin(ω t). Therefore, the expectation value of S_x is (ħ/2) sin(ω t), which matches the Bloch sphere argument! The error was in the sign of the Hamiltonian. Initially, I had taken H = ω S_z, but the correct Hamiltonian is H = -ω S_z, leading to a different time evolution operator, which fixes the sign issue.\n\nTherefore, the correct average polarization along the x-direction is proportional to sin(ω t). This makes sense physically, as the torque equation suggests that initially, the derivative of S_x is positive, leading to a positive sine function.\n\nLet me recap the corrected derivation:\n\n- The Hamiltonian is H = -γ B · S. For B along z, H = -γ B S_z. For an electron, γ is negative, but let's not worry about the sign of γ, just define ω = |γ| B, so that the time evolution is properly accounted for.\n\n- The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(i ω S_z t / ħ). With S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z, this becomes exp(i ω σ_z t / 2).\n\n- Applying this to the initial state |+y> gives a state whose <σ_x> is sin(ω t), leading to <S_x> = (ħ/2) sin(ω t).\n\nThis matches the physical intuition from the torque and the Bloch sphere.\n\nTherefore, the average polarization along the x-direction for t > 0 is proportional to sin(ω t), where ω is the Larmor frequency, given by ω = γ B. For an electron, γ = -g_s μ_B / ħ, but since we're concerned with the magnitude of the frequency, the negative sign doesn't affect the sinusoidal dependence.\n\nThus, the final answer for the average polarization along x is proportional to sin(ω t). Since the question asks for the average polarization proportional to the expectation value of S_x, the answer is sin(ω t) multiplied by the proportionality constant (ħ/2). However, since the question says \"proportional to\", we can just state the functional form.\n\nBut let me check if there is a specific form expected. The problem says \"Find the average polarization along the x direction for t>0 (proportional to the expectation value of S_x).\" So they want the expectation value <S_x(t)>, which we found to be (ħ/2) sin(ω t). However, depending on the conventions used in the course or textbook, the Larmor frequency might be defined with a different sign or factor, but the essential time dependence is sinusoidal.\n\nHowever, let me recall that in the equations of motion derived from the Heisenberg picture, with the corrected sign, we had dS_x/dt = γ B S_y, dS_y/dt = -γ B S_x. Let me define ω = γ B, then the equations are dS_x/dt = ω S_y, dS_y/dt = -ω S_x. This system has solutions S_x(t) = A cos(ω t) + B sin(ω t), and similarly for S_y. With initial conditions S_x(0) = 0, S_y(0) = ħ/2, we find S_x(t) = (ħ/2) sin(ω t), which matches our calculation. Therefore, this confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the average polarization along the x-direction is (ħ/2) sin(ω t). Since the question says \"proportional to\", the answer is proportional to sin(ω t). However, if they want the explicit expression, it would be (ħ/2) sin(ω t), where ω is the Larmor frequency. But since the problem might expect an answer in terms of known constants or to express ω in terms of the magnetic field and electron properties, but since it says \"proportional to\", we can just give the sinusoidal function.\n\nBut let me check if there's any chance I missed a factor of 2 or something due to the g-factor. For an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is related to the g-factor. The Larmor frequency is ω = γ B, and γ = -g_s μ_B / ħ. Since g_s ≈ 2, and μ_B = eħ/(2m_e), then ω = -g_s e B / (2m_e). But since we're dealing with the magnitude, it's ω = g_s e B / (2m_e). However, since the question says \"proportional to\", the exact value of ω isn't needed, just the functional form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the average polarization along the x-direction is proportional to sin(ω t), where ω is the Larmor frequency. If they want it in terms of the given parameters, but since no specific parameters are given (like the magnitude of the magnetic field), just the direction, the answer is simply proportional to sin(ω t). However, in many textbooks, the expectation value is written as <S_x(t)> = (ħ/2) sin(ω t), so if they want the explicit expression, that would be it. But since they say \"proportional to\", the answer is sin(ω t).\n\nBut to confirm, let me check a textbook example. For example, in Sakurai's Modern Quantum Mechanics, the time evolution of spin-1/2 in a magnetic field is discussed. The expectation value of the spin precesses around the magnetic field direction. For a magnetic field along z, an initial state along y would precess in the x-y plane, and the expectation values of S_x and S_y would oscillate sinusoidally. The exact expression is <S_x> = (ħ/2) sin(ω t), <S_y> = (ħ/2) cos(ω t), assuming the initial state is along y. Wait, but earlier calculations gave <S_x> = (ħ/2) sin(ω t), and from the equations of motion, if S_x(t) = (ħ/2) sin(ω t), then S_y(t) = (ħ/2) cos(ω t). But let me check with our corrected calculation.\n\nFrom the state |ψ(t)> = [exp(i ω t / 2), i exp(-i ω t / 2)] / √2, we can compute <S_y> as well. Let me do that quickly. The operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The expectation value <σ_y> is first* * (-i) second + second* * i first.\n\nFirst* is exp(-i ω t / 2)/√2,\n\nSecond is i exp(-i ω t / 2)/√2,\n\nSo first* * (-i) second = exp(-i ω t / 2)/√2 * (-i) * i exp(-i ω t / 2)/√2 = exp(-i ω t / 2)/√2 * (1) exp(-i ω t / 2)/√2 = exp(-i ω t)/2.\n\nSecond* is -i exp(i ω t / 2)/√2,\n\nFirst is exp(i ω t / 2)/√2,\n\nSo second* * i first = -i exp(i ω t / 2)/√2 * i exp(i ω t / 2)/√2 = -i^2 exp(i ω t)/2 = exp(i ω t)/2.\n\nTherefore, total <σ_y> = exp(-i ω t)/2 + exp(i ω t)/2 = cos(ω t). Therefore, <S_y> = (ħ/2) cos(ω t). This makes sense: starting at t=0, <S_y> = ħ/2, and it decreases as cos(ω t), while <S_x> increases as sin(ω t), showing precession in the x-y plane. This confirms the correctness of the result.\n\nTherefore, the average polarization along the x-direction is proportional to sin(ω t). Since the question asks for this, the answer is proportional to sin(ω t). Depending on the context, the proportionality constant would be (ħ/2), but since they say \"proportional to\", we can just state the functional form.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average polarization along the $ x $-direction for $ t > 0 $ is proportional to $ \\sin(\\omega t) $, so the final answer is \\boxed{0} if considering the average over time, but since the question asks for the time-dependent average, the correct expression is \\boxed{\\sin(\\omega t)}. However, given the precise calculation and the expectation value derived, the correct boxed answer should reflect the sinusoidal dependence. But let me check once more.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Find the average polarization along the x direction for t>0 (proportional to the expectation value of S_x).\" Since we derived that it's proportional to sin(ωt), and the question says \"proportional to\", the answer is simply sin(ωt). But in the format requested, they might expect a box around the expression. However, the problem might expect a numerical coefficient if more information is given, but since no specific values are provided, and it's stated to be proportional, the answer is sin(ωt). But the problem might be expecting a specific form with constants, but since it's not specified, and given the standard result, the answer is \\boxed{0} if they consider average over time, but since it's time-dependent, and the question specifies for t>0, the correct answer is \\boxed{\\sin(\\omega t)}. However, in many textbooks, the expectation value is written as (ħ/2) sin(ωt), but since the question says \"proportional to\", the answer is simply sin(ωt). But I need to check if the average polarization is asked for, and if so, whether it's time-averaged or not. The question says \"average polarization along the x direction for t>0\", which likely means the time-dependent average, not time-averaged. Since at any time t>0, it's sin(ωt). Hence, the answer is proportional to sin(ωt), and the box should contain the expression. But since the problem might expect a numerical value or a specific form, but given the information, the answer is \\boxed{0} if they consider average over all time, but no, the question says for t>0, and the average polarization is time-dependent. Therefore, the correct answer is proportional to sin(ωt), and since the question asks to put the final answer within \\boxed{}, and assuming they want the functional form, I should write \\boxed{\\sin(\\omega t)}. However, in some contexts, the average polarization might refer to the time-averaged value, which would be zero, but the question specifies \"for t>0\", implying the time-dependent average. Given that, I think the correct answer is \\boxed{0} if it's time-averaged, but since the question says \"for t>0\" and asks for the expectation value, which is time-dependent, the correct answer is \\boxed{\\sin(\\omega t)}. But I need to check the exact wording again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Find the average polarization along the x direction for t>0 (proportional to the expectation value of S_x).\" The key here is that \"average polarization\" might refer to the expectation value, which is time-dependent and equal to (ħ/2) sin(ωt). Since they say \"proportional to\", the answer is sin(ωt). However, in some contexts, \"average\" might mean time-averaged, but given that it specifies \"for t>0\", it's more likely referring to the instantaneous expectation value. Therefore, the answer is proportional to sin(ωt), and I should box that. However, since the problem might expect an expression without ω, but since ω is the Larmor frequency, and it's defined by the magnetic field and electron properties, and since the question doesn't give specific values, the answer remains in terms of ω.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n\nWait, no! This contradicts our derivation. Earlier, we found that the expectation value is (ħ/2) sin(ωt), which is not zero. The confusion might be arising from the term \"average polarization\". If \"average\" is meant to imply time-averaged over all time, then yes, it would be zero. But if it's the average (expectation value) at time t>0, then it's (ħ/2) sin(ωt). The problem says \"average polarization along the x direction for t>0 (proportional to the expectation value of S_x)\". The phrase \"for t>0\" suggests that it's asking for the time-dependent expectation value, not the time-averaged value. Therefore, the correct answer is proportional to sin(ωt), and since the question says \"proportional to\", the answer is sin(ωt). However, the system might expect a numerical answer, but given the parameters, it's impossible without knowing ω. However, in quantum mechanics problems like this, often the expected answer is the time-dependent sinusoidal function. Given that, and the fact that the user might expect the answer in a box, I think the correct boxed answer is \\boxed{0} if they consider average over time, but based on the derivation, it's \\boxed{\\sin(\\omega t)}. But since the problem is from a textbook or exam, and given that similar problems often expect the time-averaged value (which is zero) or the expression in terms of sin(ωt), I need to decide.\n\nWait, let me think about what \"average polarization\" means. In the context of quantum mechanics, the \"average polarization\" is the expectation value of the polarization, which is time-dependent here. So it's not a time-averaged value, but the instantaneous expectation value. Therefore, the answer is proportional to sin(ωt), and the box should contain that. However, since the user might expect a numerical value, but since it's not possible without more information, and given the problem's phrasing, I must conclude that the answer is \\boxed{0} is incorrect, and the correct answer is \\boxed{\\sin(\\omega t)}. But since the problem says \"proportional to\", and the proportionality constant is (ħ/2), but they just want the form, the answer is \\boxed{\\sin(\\omega t)}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\sin(\\omega t)}\n</think>"}
