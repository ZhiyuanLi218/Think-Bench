Let me start by recalling what gravitational potential energy (GPE) is. For an object near the Earth's surface, GPE is usually calculated as $ U = mgh $, where $ m $ is mass, $ g $ is acceleration due to gravity, and $ h $ is the height of the center of mass above a reference point. \n\nSince the cylinder is being moved from a horizontal to a vertical position, the key here is to determine the center of mass (COM) in both configurations and then compute the difference in their heights. The cylinder's mass distribution is uniform, right? So the COM should be at its geometric center in both cases. Let me confirm that. For a uniform cylinder, yes, the COM is at the midpoint of its length and at the center of its cross-section. \n\nLet me define some variables. Let me denote the height of the cylinder when it's standing vertically as $ H $, and its radius as $ R $. When it's horizontal, the cylinder is lying on its side. So, when vertical, the COM is at a height of $ H/2 $ above the ground. When horizontal, the COM is at a height equal to the radius $ R $, since the cylinder is resting on its curved surface. Wait, is that correct? If the cylinder is lying horizontally on a flat surface, the distance from the ground to the COM would be equal to the radius, because the cylinder's cross-section is a circle with radius $ R $, and the COM is at the center of the circle. So yes, if it's lying on its side, the height of the COM is $ R $.\n\nTherefore, the gravitational potential energy when horizontal ($ E_0 $) would be $ mgR $, and when vertical ($ E_1 $) it would be $ mg(H/2) $. Therefore, the change in potential energy $ \\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = mg(H/2 - R) $. \n\nSo if $ H/2 > R $, then $ \\Delta E $ is positive, meaning that the potential energy increases when the cylinder is moved to the vertical position. Now, the problem mentions that the vertical position is unstable when $ \\Delta E > 0 $ or when $ H/2 > R $. I need to explain why that is the case.\n\nLet me recall some concepts about stability. An object is in a stable equilibrium if, when displaced slightly, it returns to its original position. If it moves away further, it's unstable. The potential energy is a key factor here. In a stable equilibrium, the potential energy is at a minimum. If you have to do work to move the object away from that position, then it's stable. Conversely, if moving it to a position requires increasing potential energy, and if that position is a maximum, then it's unstable.\n\nWait, so if the vertical position has a higher potential energy than the horizontal one, that suggests that the vertical position is at a higher potential energy. If the system tends to minimize potential energy, then the vertical position would be less stable. However, why is it unstable? Let me think about the balance. If the cylinder is standing vertically, its center of mass is higher. If you tilt it slightly, the center of mass will shift. If the vertical position is such that when you tilt it, the center of mass rises, then it would be stable? Wait, no. If tilting causes the center of mass to rise, then the object would tend to return to its original position because it's trying to lower its potential energy. But if tilting causes the center of mass to lower, then it will continue to fall, making it unstable.\n\nLet me visualize this. Suppose the cylinder is vertical. If I tilt it slightly, the COM will move in some direction. If the vertical position is such that the base of the cylinder (the area in contact with the ground) is small compared to the height, then tilting it could cause the COM to shift outside the base, leading to a torque that causes it to fall over. The critical factor here is the position of the COM relative to the base of support.\n\nIn the vertical position, the base of support is the circular face of the cylinder, which has a radius $ R $. Wait, no. If the cylinder is standing vertically on its circular base, then the base is a circle with radius $ R $, so the base of support is quite large. However, if the cylinder is standing vertically but on its side? Wait, no, if it's vertical, it's standing on one of its circular ends. If it's horizontal, it's lying on its curved side. So when vertical, the base is the circular face with radius $ R $, so the base is large. However, the height is $ H $. The stability of the vertical position depends on whether the COM is within the base when tilted. \n\nIf you tilt the cylinder slightly, the vertical line through the COM must still pass through the base for it to be stable. The maximum angle before it topples can be determined by the geometry. For a cylinder standing vertically, the critical angle $ \\theta $ before toppling occurs is given by $ \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{R}{H/2} $, because when the COM is directly above the edge of the base, any further tilt would cause it to fall. Wait, actually, the critical angle is when the horizontal displacement of the COM equals the radius. If the cylinder is tilted so that the COM is horizontally displaced by $ R $ from the vertical axis, then it will topple. \n\nBut how does this relate to the potential energy? If $ H/2 > R $, which would mean that the COM is higher than the radius. Wait, if the height of the COM in the vertical position is $ H/2 $, and when horizontal it's $ R $. So when $ H/2 > R $, the vertical position has a higher COM. Intuitively, a higher COM makes the object less stable because it can be toppled more easily. \n\nBut why is the vertical position unstable when $ \\Delta E > 0 $? Because if the potential energy is higher in the vertical position, then that position is like a potential energy \"hill\". If you can move to a position with lower potential energy (by falling over), then the vertical position is unstable. In contrast, if the potential energy is lower in the vertical position (i.e., $ H/2 < R $), then the vertical position is a lower potential energy state, and the horizontal position is higher. In that case, the vertical position would be stable because any displacement would require increasing the potential energy.\n\nWait, but if $ H/2 < R $, meaning the vertical position has lower potential energy, then moving to vertical is more stable. But if $ H/2 > R $, moving to vertical increases potential energy, so the vertical position is an unstable equilibrium. \n\nLet me think about the potential energy curve. If you imagine slowly tilting the cylinder from the vertical position, the potential energy would first increase to a maximum and then decrease as it falls over. If the vertical position is at a local maximum of potential energy, it's unstable. If it's at a local minimum, it's stable. \n\nTherefore, when $ \\Delta E > 0 $, the vertical position is at a higher potential energy than the horizontal position. Therefore, the vertical position is an unstable equilibrium because any small displacement lowers the potential energy, causing the cylinder to continue moving away from the vertical position. \n\nBut how does $ H/2 > R $ relate to this? Let me check with an example. Suppose the cylinder is very tall compared to its radius. So $ H $ is large, $ R $ is small. Then $ H/2 > R $, so vertical position has higher potential energy. If you tilt the cylinder, the COM moves in an arc. At some point, the COM will be lower than the vertical position, so the cylinder will tend to fall further. \n\nAlternatively, if $ H/2 < R $, meaning the cylinder is short and wide, then vertical position has lower potential energy. If you tilt it, the potential energy increases, so the cylinder would tend to return to vertical. \n\nTherefore, the condition for instability is when the vertical position is a local maximum in potential energy, which occurs when $ H/2 > R $. \n\nBut let me verify the calculation for $ \\Delta E $. If the cylinder is horizontal, the COM is at height $ R $. If vertical, the COM is at height $ H/2 $. Therefore, $ \\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = mg(H/2 - R) $. Therefore, if $ H/2 > R $, then $ \\Delta E > 0 $. \n\nSo the problem says to explain why vertical position is unstable when $ \\Delta E > 0 $ or $ H/2 > R $. So my explanation is that when vertical position has higher potential energy, it is an unstable equilibrium because any displacement results in a decrease in potential energy, leading the system to move away from the vertical position. \n\nBut to make this more precise, maybe I should consider the potential energy as a function of the tilt angle. Let me attempt that. \n\nLet me model the cylinder as a rigid body. When it's vertical, let's consider tilting it by an angle $ \\theta $. The question is, how does the height of the COM change as a function of $ \\theta $? \n\nAssuming the cylinder is standing on its base, which has radius $ R $. When you tilt it by an angle $ \\theta $, the point of contact with the ground changes. The maximum angle before toppling is when the COM is directly above the edge of the base. \n\nThe height of the COM as a function of tilt angle can be calculated. Let me imagine tilting the cylinder until it is about to topple. At that critical angle, the COM is directly above the edge of the base. The vertical line through the COM passes through the edge of the base. \n\nIn this case, the geometry would be such that the horizontal distance from the original vertical axis to the COM is $ R $. The height of the COM is still... Wait, no, when tilted, the height of the COM changes. Let me think again. \n\nActually, when you tilt the cylinder, the COM is displaced both horizontally and vertically. Let me consider the cylinder as a rectangular prism? No, it's a cylinder. Maybe it's easier to model it as a rectangular block for simplicity? Wait, no, the cylinder has a circular base. \n\nLet me consider the cylinder standing vertically. Its height is $ H $, radius $ R $. When it is tilted by an angle $ \\theta $, the center of mass will be displaced. The critical condition for toppling is when the projection of the COM onto the ground lies at the edge of the base. \n\nAt that critical angle $ \\theta_c $, the COM is directly above the edge of the base. The original vertical line through the COM is at distance $ R $ from the edge. When tilted, the horizontal displacement of the COM from the original axis is $ R $. \n\nBut how is this related to the angle? The cylinder's axis is tilted by $ \\theta $, so the COM, which is at a height $ H/2 $, will have its horizontal displacement equal to $ (H/2) \\sin \\theta $, and vertical position $ (H/2) \\cos \\theta $. Wait, is that correct? If the cylinder is tilted such that its axis makes an angle $ \\theta $ with the vertical, then yes, the COM, which is at half the length along the axis, will have coordinates relative to the original position. \n\nBut for the cylinder to be in the critical position, the horizontal displacement must equal $ R $. Therefore:\n\n$ (H/2) \\sin \\theta_c = R $\n\nSo,\n\n$ \\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{2R}{H} $\n\nTherefore, the critical angle is $ \\theta_c = \\arcsin(2R / H) $. However, this requires that $ 2R / H \\leq 1 $, so $ H \\geq 2R $. Wait, but if $ H < 2R $, then $ \\sin \\theta_c $ would be greater than 1, which is impossible, implying that the cylinder cannot be tilted to the critical angle; in other words, it is always stable. \n\nThis seems contradictory to my earlier thought. Wait, if $ H < 2R $, meaning that $ H/2 < R $, then according to this formula, there is no real critical angle. Which suggests that the cylinder cannot be tilted enough for the COM to reach the edge of the base, meaning that it is always stable. Conversely, if $ H > 2R $, then there is a critical angle beyond which it topples. \n\nBut how does this relate to the potential energy? Let me think. If the cylinder is in the vertical position and $ H > 2R $, then it can be tilted to a critical angle where it is in neutral equilibrium (balanced on the edge), and beyond that it falls. If $ H < 2R $, then no matter how you tilt it, the COM remains above the base, so it's stable. \n\nBut how does this tie into the potential energy? Let me consider the potential energy as a function of the tilt angle. The height of the COM when tilted by an angle $ \\theta $ is $ h(\\theta) = (H/2) \\cos \\theta $. Therefore, the potential energy is $ U(\\theta) = m g (H/2) \\cos \\theta $. \n\nWait, if that's the case, then the potential energy as a function of $ \\theta $ is $ U(\\theta) = mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $. Therefore, the vertical position corresponds to $ \\theta = 0 $, where $ U(0) = mg(H/2) $. If we tilt it slightly, $ \\theta $ increases, and $ \\cos \\theta $ decreases, so the potential energy decreases. Therefore, the vertical position is a local maximum of potential energy. \n\nWait, if $ U(\\theta) $ has a maximum at $ \\theta = 0 $, then that position is unstable. Because if you displace it slightly, the potential energy decreases, leading to a restoring torque? Wait, no. If potential energy decreases when you displace it, then the system will tend to move further in that direction, because it's going to lower potential energy. Therefore, the vertical position is unstable. \n\nBut this seems to suggest that regardless of $ H $ and $ R $, the vertical position is always a local maximum of potential energy. But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that when $ H < 2R $, the cylinder is stable. What's the problem here?\n\nAh, perhaps my model is incorrect. Because in reality, the cylinder cannot tilt beyond the critical angle where the COM is above the edge of the base. Beyond that angle, the cylinder falls over. But in the expression $ U(\\theta) = mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $, it assumes that the cylinder remains in contact with the ground at the original base point, which is only true until the critical angle. Beyond that, the point of contact changes, and the model is no longer valid. \n\nTherefore, if we consider only angles less than the critical angle $ \\theta_c $, then depending on whether the potential energy increases or decreases with small tilts, we can determine stability. However, according to $ U(\\theta) = mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $, the potential energy decreases with any tilt, implying that the vertical position is always unstable. But this contradicts the earlier geometric argument where if $ H < 2R $, the cylinder cannot be tilted enough to topple. \n\nClearly, there is a contradiction here. Let me resolve this. \n\nThe key is that when $ H < 2R $, the critical angle $ \\theta_c = \\arcsin(2R / H) $ would be greater than 90 degrees, which is not physically meaningful. Wait, actually, if $ H < 2R $, then $ 2R / H > 1 $, so $ \\theta_c $ would be undefined. Therefore, for any tilt angle $ \\theta $, the horizontal displacement $ (H/2) \\sin \\theta $ is less than $ R $, meaning that the COM remains above the base. Therefore, the cylinder can be tilted any amount and still remain in contact with the ground over its entire base. Therefore, in this case, what happens to the potential energy? \n\nIf the cylinder can be tilted arbitrarily without toppling, then the potential energy function $ U(\\theta) = mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $ would still hold. However, if we analyze the stability by looking at the second derivative of $ U(\\theta) $ at $ \\theta = 0 $, we can determine if it's a maximum or minimum. \n\nThe first derivative of $ U $ with respect to $ \\theta $ is $ dU/d\\theta = -mg(H/2) \\sin \\theta $. The second derivative is $ d²U/dθ² = -mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $. At $ \\theta = 0 $, the second derivative is negative, indicating a local maximum. Therefore, regardless of $ H $ and $ R $, the vertical position is a local maximum of potential energy. \n\nBut this seems to suggest that the vertical position is always unstable, which conflicts with the geometric argument that when $ H < 2R $, the cylinder cannot topple. What's the resolution?\n\nAh, perhaps the difference is between the potential energy function within the region where the cylinder can tilt without toppling. If the vertical position is a local maximum of potential energy, then it's unstable, but if there are constraints that prevent the system from moving away from the maximum (i.e., the cylinder cannot topple because the COM doesn't reach the edge), then effectively, within the allowed range of motion, the vertical position might be a metastable state? \n\nWait, but in reality, if the vertical position is a local maximum of potential energy, even if you can't topple it, it's still an unstable equilibrium. Because if you displace it slightly, the potential energy decreases, so the cylinder will have a tendency to continue moving in that direction. However, if the displacement is constrained (because you can't tilt beyond a certain angle without toppling), then maybe in practice, small displacements result in oscillations around the vertical position? \n\nWait, no. If the potential energy decreases when you tilt it, then there is a torque that tends to increase the tilt angle, making it unstable. However, if the tilt is constrained, such that when you tilt it, it can't go beyond a certain point, then maybe it's stable? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me think of a simple example. Consider a pencil standing on its tip. It's a vertical position with a very high COM. The potential energy is at a maximum, so it's unstable. Even though in theory, if you could balance it perfectly, it would stay, but any small perturbation causes it to fall. \n\nNow consider a short, wide cylinder, say a coin standing on its edge. The vertical position (standing on edge) has a higher COM than when it's lying flat. However, due to the short height and wide base, it's stable. Wait, but according to the potential energy function, standing on edge would still be a local maximum. How is that possible?\n\nWait, maybe my model is incorrect. Perhaps I need to consider the potential energy as a function of tilt angle with the correct geometry. \n\nLet me re-examine the potential energy when the cylinder is tilted. Suppose the cylinder is standing vertically on its base. When it tilts, the point of contact with the ground changes. However, for small angles, the cylinder can be considered to pivot around the edge of the base. Wait, but if the base is a circle, there isn't a single edge; it's a continuous surface. However, when tilting, the cylinder will eventually contact the ground at a new point on the circumference of the base. \n\nFor small tilts, before reaching the critical angle, the cylinder might still be supported over its entire base, but as it tilts more, the weight vector shifts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the cylinder as a rigid body and compute the potential energy as a function of tilt angle, considering the correct height of the COM. \n\nLet me consider the cylinder as a rigid cylinder of height $ H $, radius $ R $, mass $ m $, standing vertically on a flat surface. The COM is at height $ H/2 $. Now, if we tilt it by an angle $ \\theta $ from the vertical, what is the new height of the COM?\n\nAssuming that the cylinder remains in contact with the ground at all points under the base, which is only true until the tilt angle reaches the critical angle. However, for small angles, we can approximate that the cylinder is pivoting around its base. Wait, but if it's pivoting around a point on the edge of the base, then the height of the COM would change accordingly. \n\nLet me consider the cylinder pivoting about the lowest point on its base circumference. When tilted by angle $ \\theta $, the COM will be displaced. The height of the COM can be found by considering the geometry. \n\nThe original vertical axis of the cylinder is tilted by angle $ \\theta $. The COM is at a distance $ H/2 $ from the pivot point (the edge of the base). The vertical height of the COM would then be $ (H/2) \\cos \\theta $. Therefore, the potential energy is $ U = mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $. \n\nTherefore, the potential energy as a function of tilt angle is $ U(\\theta) = mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $. \n\nTaking the derivative, $ dU/d\\theta = -mg(H/2) \\sin \\theta $. At $ \\theta = 0 $, the first derivative is zero, indicating equilibrium. The second derivative is $ -mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $, which at $ \\theta = 0 $ is negative. This means the potential energy has a local maximum at $ \\theta = 0 $, implying that the vertical position is unstable. \n\nBut this seems to suggest that regardless of the cylinder's dimensions, the vertical position is always unstable. However, in reality, a short, wide cylinder (like a coin standing on its edge) can be stable. What's the issue here?\n\nAh, perhaps the assumption that the cylinder pivots around the edge of the base is incorrect for certain dimensions. If the cylinder is short enough (H small, R large), when you tilt it, the COM remains above the base, and the cylinder doesn't pivot around the edge but instead just rocks slightly while maintaining contact over the entire base. In this case, the model where the potential energy is $ U(\\theta) = mg(H/2) \\cos \\theta $ is not accurate, because the pivot point isn't fixed at the edge. \n\nThis suggests that my previous model is only valid when tilting beyond a certain angle where the cylinder begins to pivot around the edge. For small tilts where the COM is still above the base, the actual potential energy might not decrease, or the restoring torque might be present. \n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's consider the cylinder resting on a flat surface. The gravitational potential energy depends on the height of the COM. For the vertical position, it's $ H/2 $. For the horizontal position, it's $ R $. The difference is $ \\Delta E = mg(H/2 - R) $. \n\nIf $ H/2 > R $, then $ \\Delta E > 0 $, so the vertical position has higher potential energy. If the cylinder is in the vertical position, any small displacement that lowers the COM will result in a decrease in potential energy, which the system will tend to follow, making the vertical position unstable. \n\nConversely, if $ H/2 < R $, then the vertical position has lower potential energy. In this case, moving the cylinder to a tilted position would raise the COM, increasing potential energy, so the vertical position is stable because any small displacement results in a higher potential energy, creating a restoring force. \n\nBut how does this reconcile with the earlier analysis where the potential energy as a function of tilt angle had a maximum at $ \\theta = 0 $? It seems like there are two different scenarios depending on whether $ H/2 $ is greater than or less than $ R $. \n\nMaybe the key is that when $ H/2 < R $, tilting the cylinder actually raises the COM, whereas when $ H/2 > R $, tilting lowers the COM. Wait, how can that be? \n\nLet me think about tilting a short, wide cylinder (H/2 < R). Imagine tilting it slightly from the vertical. The COM moves in an arc. Depending on the dimensions, the vertical component of the COM's position might increase or decrease. \n\nLet me calculate the vertical position of the COM when tilted. Assume the cylinder is tilted such that its axis makes an angle $ \\theta $ with the vertical. The height of the COM is the vertical distance from the ground to the COM. \n\nIf the cylinder is tilted, but still in contact with the ground along its entire base, the height of the COM would still be... Wait, if the base remains flat on the ground, then the height of the COM is still $ H/2 $, regardless of tilt? No, that can't be. If you tilt a cylinder that's standing on its base, the base remains in contact with the ground, but the height of the COM doesn't change? That doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, no. If the cylinder is tilted but still resting on its entire base, the height of the COM is still measured vertically. However, the vertical height of the COM would depend on how the cylinder is tilted. Wait, actually, if the cylinder is tilted but still resting on its base, the vertical height of the COM is still $ H/2 $, because the base is flat and the COM is at the center. Wait, no! If you tilt the cylinder, the vertical height of the COM would actually depend on the tilt. \n\nLet me clarify with a diagram. Imagine a cylinder standing vertically on its base. The COM is at $ H/2 $. Now, if you tilt the cylinder forward, keeping the entire base in contact with the ground, the vertical position of the COM would actually decrease? Or increase? \n\nWait, if you tilt the cylinder forward, the top of the cylinder moves forward and down, while the bottom remains in place. The COM, being halfway up the cylinder, would also move forward and down. Therefore, its vertical height decreases. \n\nBut if the entire base remains in contact with the ground, how is this possible? It seems like the vertical height of the COM would decrease when tilted, implying that the potential energy decreases, which would suggest the vertical position is unstable. But this contradicts the idea that a short, wide cylinder can be stable when standing vertically. \n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the error is in assuming that the entire base remains in contact with the ground when tilted. In reality, for a cylinder, when you tilt it, the base remains in contact with the ground, but the vertical height of the COM decreases. Therefore, the potential energy decreases, suggesting the vertical position is unstable. However, in practice, short, wide cylinders can be stable when standing vertically. What gives?\n\nWait, maybe the difference is in the base of support. For a cylinder, the base of support is the entire circular base. When tilted, as long as the vertical projection of the COM remains within the base, the cylinder remains stable. If the projection moves outside, it topples. \n\nSo the stability depends on whether the COM stays within the base when tilted. For a short, wide cylinder (H/2 < R), even when tilted significantly, the vertical projection of the COM remains within the base. For a tall, thin cylinder (H/2 > R), tilting slightly causes the projection to move outside the base, leading to toppling. \n\nTherefore, the potential energy analysis needs to consider whether tilting causes the COM to rise or fall. If tilting causes the COM to rise, then the vertical position is stable; if it causes the COM to fall, it's unstable. \n\nBut earlier, I thought tilting always lowers the COM's vertical height. How can tilting cause the COM to rise? \n\nLet me do the math. Suppose the cylinder is tilted by an angle $ \\theta $, and we want to find the vertical height of the COM. If the cylinder is tilted such that its axis makes an angle $ \\theta $ with the vertical, and assuming it is still resting on its base (not yet toppling), then the height of the COM is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, consider the cylinder as a rigid body with its COM at $ (0, H/2) $ when vertical. When tilted by angle $ \\theta $, if it's pivoting around a point on the edge of the base, the height of the COM would be $ (H/2) \\cos \\theta $. But if it's not pivoting and the entire base is still in contact, the height is different. \n\nThis is getting too abstract. Let me look for a standard result. \n\nIn general, for a rigid body, the condition for stability is that the vertical line through the COM falls within the base of support. If it falls outside, the object topples. The potential energy is lowest when the COM is as low as possible. \n\nWhen the cylinder is vertical, its COM is at $ H/2 $. When it's horizontal, the COM is at $ R $. The difference $ \\Delta E = mg(H/2 - R) $. \n\nIf $ H/2 > R $, then the vertical position has higher potential energy. This suggests that the system can lower its potential energy by falling over, hence the vertical position is unstable. If $ H/2 < R $, the vertical position has lower potential energy, so the horizontal position has higher potential energy. In this case, the vertical position is stable because any displacement to a horizontal position increases potential energy. \n\nTherefore, the key is comparing $ H/2 $ to $ R $. If the vertical position has higher potential energy, it's unstable; if lower, it's stable. \n\nThis seems to be the main point. The confusion earlier about the potential energy function was due to incorrect assumptions about how the COM height changes with tilt. The correct approach is to compare the potential energies in the two extreme positions (vertical and horizontal) and determine based on that. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the change in gravitational potential energy is $ \\Delta E = mg(H/2 - R) $. When $ \\Delta E > 0 $, meaning $ H/2 > R $, the vertical position has higher potential energy. In such a case, the cylinder can lower its potential energy by toppling to the horizontal position, making the vertical position unstable. Conversely, if $ \\Delta E < 0 $, the vertical position is stable because any displacement would increase potential energy, leading to a restoring force.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe change in gravitational potential energy is \\boxed{\\dfrac{mgH}{2} - mgR}. The vertical position is unstable when $\\frac{H}{2} > R$ because the potential energy is higher, allowing the cylinder to lower its energy by toppling.\n</think>"}
