The CMB photons have an average energy of 10^-3 eV. The options are given in GeV, so I need to convert units appropriately. Let me start by recalling the process and the physics involved.\n\nFirst, the reaction is γγ → e⁺e⁻. So, a high-energy gamma-ray photon (let's call its energy E_γ) collides with a low-energy CMB photon (energy ε, which is given as 10^-3 eV) and they annihilate into an electron-positron pair. For this process to happen, the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so two electrons would be 1.022 MeV. Therefore, the threshold condition is that the center-of-mass energy squared, s, must be at least (2m_e c²)².\n\nThe center-of-mass energy squared for two photons is given by s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (|p_γ c + p_ε c|)^2. But since photons are moving at the speed of light, their momenta are p_γ = E_γ / c and p_ε = ε / c. However, because they are moving in opposite directions (assuming a head-on collision, which gives the maximum energy in the center-of-mass frame), their momenta would subtract. Wait, actually, if they are colliding, their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total momentum is E_γ/c - ε/c. But since ε is much smaller than E_γ, maybe we can approximate?\n\nBut let me recall the exact formula for the center-of-mass energy squared for two photons. The general formula for the Mandelstam variable s is:\n\ns = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1 + p2|c)^2\n\nBut since both are photons, their energies are E1 = hν1, E2 = hν2, and their momenta are p1 = E1/c, p2 = E2/c. Assuming they are moving in opposite directions, the angle between them is 180 degrees. However, in reality, the exact angle might affect the cross-section, but for the threshold energy, we consider the maximum possible s for a given E_γ and ε, which would be when they are moving directly towards each other.\n\nSo let's compute s:\n\ns = (E_γ + ε)^2 - ( (E_γ/c - ε/c ) c )^2\n\nWait, because if they are in opposite directions, then the magnitude of the total momentum is |E_γ/c - ε/c|. Then multiplying by c gives |E_γ - ε|. Therefore:\n\ns = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 c²/c² ?\n\nWait, no. Let me do it step by step.\n\nThe total energy is E_total = E_γ + ε.\n\nThe total momentum magnitude is |p_total| = |p_γ - p_ε| because they are in opposite directions. Since p_γ = E_γ / c and p_ε = ε / c, then |p_total| = |E_γ / c - ε / c| = |E_γ - ε| / c.\n\nTherefore, the square of the total momentum times c² is (|E_γ - ε| / c)^2 * c² = (E_γ - ε)^2.\n\nTherefore, the Mandelstam variable s is:\n\ns = (E_total)^2 - (|p_total| c)^2 = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2.\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\n(E_γ + ε)^2 = E_γ² + 2 E_γ ε + ε²\n\n(E_γ - ε)^2 = E_γ² - 2 E_γ ε + ε²\n\nSubtracting them:\n\ns = [E_γ² + 2 E_γ ε + ε²] - [E_γ² - 2 E_γ ε + ε²] = 4 E_γ ε.\n\nTherefore, s = 4 E_γ ε.\n\nAt threshold, s must equal (2 m_e c²)^2. Therefore:\n\n4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c²)^2 ⇒ E_γ ε = m_e² c^4.\n\nTherefore, solving for E_γ:\n\nE_γ = (m_e² c^4) / ε.\n\nWait, but let me check the units here. Let me recall that the rest energy of the electron is m_e c². So m_e c² is 0.511 MeV. Therefore, m_e² c^4 has units of (energy)^2. And ε is an energy. Therefore, E_γ would have units of energy, which is correct. So this formula seems okay.\n\nBut let me check again. If s = 4 E_γ ε, and s_threshold = (2 m_e c²)^2. Therefore:\n\n4 E_γ ε = 4 m_e² c^4 ⇒ E_γ ε = m_e² c^4 ⇒ E_γ = (m_e² c^4)/ε.\n\nBut since m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, then m_e² c^4 is (0.511 MeV)^2. Therefore:\n\nE_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / ε.\n\nGiven that ε is 10^-3 eV. Let me convert units so that everything is consistent.\n\nFirst, let me convert 0.511 MeV to eV: 0.511 MeV = 511 keV = 5.11 × 10^5 eV.\n\nTherefore, (m_e c²)^2 = (5.11 × 10^5 eV)^2 = 2.61 × 10^11 eV².\n\nThen, E_γ = (2.61 × 10^11 eV²) / ε.\n\nGiven that ε is 10^-3 eV, so:\n\nE_γ = 2.61 × 10^11 eV² / 10^-3 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV.\n\nConvert that to GeV: 1 GeV = 10^9 eV, so:\n\nE_γ = 2.61 × 10^14 eV / 10^9 eV/GeV = 2.61 × 10^5 GeV ≈ 2.6 × 10^5 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.6 × 10^5 GeV. So that would be the answer? Wait, but let me check if I did the calculation correctly.\n\nWait, let me recalculate (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV):\n\nFirst, 0.511 MeV = 5.11 × 10^5 eV.\n\nSo squared is (5.11 × 10^5)^2 = approx 26.1 × 10^10 eV². Wait, 5.11 squared is approx 26.1, so 26.1 × 10^10 eV².\n\nDivide by 10^-3 eV gives 26.1 × 10^13 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV.\n\nConvert to GeV: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 2.61 × 10^14 / 1e9 = 2.61 × 10^5 GeV. So 2.61 × 1e5 GeV. Which is option C: 2.6 × 1e5 GeV. So that would be the answer. But let me check if there are any factors I missed.\n\nWait, in the formula, we had s = 4 E_γ ε, and set equal to (2 m_e c²)^2. So 4 E_γ ε = 4 m_e² c^4 ⇒ E_γ = m_e² c^4 / ε. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there a relativistic formula I might have missed? For instance, sometimes in these threshold calculations, you have to consider the lab frame versus the center-of-mass frame, but in this case, since we derived the formula by considering the center-of-mass energy, and set it to threshold, it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The threshold condition is that the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. For electron-positron pair, that's 2 m_e c². The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt(s)/c². Wait, no. The Mandelstam variable s is equal to (E_total/c)^2 - |p_total|^2. Wait, earlier we found s = 4 E_γ ε. But in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, s would be equal to (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1 + p2| c)^2, but if we set c=1, then s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1 + p2|)^2. But in our case, we found s = 4 E_γ ε. So if we are working in regular units, then s has units of (energy)^2. Then, the threshold condition is s = (2 m_e c²)^2. Therefore, equating 4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c²)^2 ⇒ same as before. Therefore, yes, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems right. So the answer is approximately 2.6 × 10^5 GeV, which is option C. However, let me check if the average photon energy of CMB is really 1e-3 eV. The CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. The average energy of a blackbody photon is about 2.7 k_B T. Let me check that.\n\nk_B is Boltzmann constant, approximately 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K. So 2.7 K × 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K ≈ 2.3 × 10^-4 eV. Wait, but the question says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. Hmm, that's about a factor of 4 higher. Maybe they are using a different measure? For example, sometimes people use the most probable energy, or maybe the question is just giving an approximate value for simplicity. Since the question says \"average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3} eV\", we have to take that as given, regardless of real-world numbers. Therefore, proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, using 1e-3 eV for ε, the calculation gives 2.6 × 1e5 GeV, which is option C. However, let me check the options again:\n\nA:9.5*1e4 GeV → 9.5 × 1e4 = 9.5 × 10^4 = 0.95 × 10^5\n\nB:3.9*1e5 → 3.9 × 10^5\n\nC:2.6*1e5 → 2.6 × 10^5\n\nD:1.8*1e5 → 1.8 × 10^5\n\nSo my calculation gives approx 2.6 × 1e5 GeV, which is option C. However, let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10^6 eV = 5.11 × 10^5 eV.\n\nSo (m_e c²)^2 = (5.11 × 10^5 eV)^2 = 5.11² × 10^10 eV².\n\n5.11 squared is 26.1121, so approx 26.1 × 10^10 eV².\n\nThen divide by ε = 1e-3 eV:\n\nE_γ = 26.1 × 10^10 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 26.1 × 10^13 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV.\n\nConvert to GeV: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so divide by 1e9:\n\n2.61 × 10^14 / 1e9 = 2.61 × 10^5 GeV ≈ 2.6 × 10^5 GeV. So yes, that's option C. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a factor of 2 missing or something. For example, if the collision is not head-on, but in the lab frame where the CMB photon is at rest? Wait, no, because the threshold condition is determined by the maximum possible center-of-mass energy, which occurs for a head-on collision. Therefore, our calculation is correct for the threshold energy. Therefore, the gamma-ray must have energy E_γ ≈ 2.6 × 10^5 GeV to reach the threshold with a CMB photon of energy 1e-3 eV. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut let me check some references or similar problems. For example, I recall that the threshold for photon-photon pair production is when the energy of the gamma-ray is about (2 m_e c²)^2 / (4 ε). Wait, which is the same as we have. So for example, if the target photon has energy ε, then the threshold energy for the gamma is (2 m_e c²)^2 / (4 ε) = m_e² c^4 / ε. So same as above.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes this is written as E_γ = ( (1 + ε/E_γ ) 2 m_e c² )^2 / (4 ε) ) or something, but at threshold, when ε << E_γ, we can neglect ε in the numerator, so E_γ ≈ ( (2 m_e c² )^2 ) / (4 ε ) = m_e² c^4 / ε. So same thing. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
