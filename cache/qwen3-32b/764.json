Hmm, let me recall what I know about drift velocity. \n\nFirst, I remember that drift velocity is the average velocity that charged particles, like electrons, attain in a material due to an electric field. It's different from their random thermal motion, which is much faster. The drift velocity is actually quite slow, right? But how do I calculate it?\n\nI think there's a formula that relates drift velocity to electric field. Maybe something with current density? Oh yeah, the formula is something like J = n e v_d, where J is the current density, n is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, e is the elementary charge, and v_d is the drift velocity. \n\nBut wait, I also remember that current density J is related to electric field E through the conductivity σ: J = σ E. So combining these two equations, σ E = n e v_d. Therefore, solving for v_d gives v_d = σ E / (n e). \n\nSo I need to find the conductivity σ of copper, the number density n of electrons in copper, and then plug in E = 1.0 V/cm. Let me check the values for copper. \n\nFirst, conductivity σ. Copper is a good conductor, and I think its conductivity is around 5.96 × 10^7 S/m. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I remember that the conductivity of copper is approximately 5.96 × 10^7 siemens per meter. Okay.\n\nNext, the number density n of free electrons in copper. Since copper has one free electron per atom, I can calculate n by finding the number of atoms per unit volume. The atomic weight of copper is about 63.55 g/mol, and its density is around 8.96 g/cm³. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, find the number of moles per unit volume. The density is 8.96 g/cm³, so per cubic meter, that's 8.96 g/cm³ * 10^6 cm³/m³ = 8.96 × 10^6 g/m³. Then divide by the molar mass to get moles per m³: (8.96 × 10^6 g/m³) / (63.55 g/mol) ≈ let me calculate that. \n\nDividing 8.96e6 by 63.55: 8.96 / 63.55 ≈ 0.141, so 0.141 × 10^6 mol/m³? Wait, no, that would be 8.96e6 / 63.55 ≈ 1.41 × 10^5 mol/m³? Wait, 8.96 divided by 63.55 is approximately 0.141, so 0.141 × 10^6? Wait, 8.96 × 10^6 divided by 63.55 is (8.96 / 63.55) × 10^6 ≈ 0.141 × 10^6 ≈ 1.41 × 10^5 mol/m³. \n\nThen multiply by Avogadro's number to get number of atoms per m³. Avogadro's number is 6.022 × 10^23 mol⁻¹. So n = 1.41 × 10^5 mol/m³ * 6.022 × 10^23 atoms/mol ≈ let's compute that. \n\n1.41 × 6.022 ≈ 8.49, so 8.49 × 10^(5+23) = 8.49 × 10^28 atoms/m³. Since each atom contributes one free electron, n ≈ 8.49 × 10^28 electrons/m³. \n\nLet me check if that's correct. I think the typical value for copper's electron density is about 8.5 × 10^28 per m³, so that seems right.\n\nNow, let me write down the known values:\n\nσ = 5.96 × 10^7 S/m\n\nE = 1.0 V/cm. Wait, the units here are V/cm. I need to convert that to V/m for consistency with SI units. Since 1 V/cm = 100 V/m, so E = 1.0 V/cm = 100 V/m.\n\ne is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 × 10^-19 C.\n\nSo plugging into the formula v_d = σ E / (n e). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute σ E: (5.96 × 10^7 S/m) * (100 V/m) = 5.96 × 10^9 S·V/m². Since 1 S is 1 A/V, so S·V is A. Therefore, σ E has units of A/m², which is current density J. Then dividing by n e gives velocity, since J = n e v_d => v_d = J / (n e).\n\nSo numerically:\n\nv_d = (5.96 × 10^9) / (8.49 × 10^28 * 1.602 × 10^-19)\n\nLet me compute the denominator first: 8.49 × 10^28 * 1.602 × 10^-19 ≈ Let me multiply 8.49 * 1.602 ≈ 13.6 (approximating). Then the exponent is 10^(28 - 19) = 10^9. So denominator ≈ 13.6 × 10^9 ≈ 1.36 × 10^10.\n\nTherefore, v_d ≈ 5.96 × 10^9 / 1.36 × 10^10 ≈ (5.96 / 1.36) × 10^(-1) ≈ 4.38 × 0.1 ≈ 0.438 m/s.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high for drift velocity. Wait, I thought drift velocities are usually on the order of mm/s or less. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait let me check the numbers again.\n\nFirst, let's recalculate the denominator more accurately. Let me compute 8.49 × 1.602 first.\n\n8.49 * 1.602:\n\nLet me do 8 * 1.602 = 12.816\n\n0.49 * 1.602 ≈ 0.49 * 1.6 = 0.784 and 0.49 * 0.002 = 0.00098, so total ≈ 0.78498 ≈ 0.785.\n\nSo total is 12.816 + 0.785 ≈ 13.601. So yes, approximately 13.6. Therefore, 13.6 × 10^9, as before.\n\nSo numerator is 5.96 × 10^9. So 5.96 / 13.6 ≈ 0.438. So v_d ≈ 0.438 m/s. Hmm. Wait, 0.4 meters per second? That seems high. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that another formula for drift velocity is v_d = μ E, where μ is the electron mobility. Maybe I can check the mobility of copper and see if that gives a similar result.\n\nElectron mobility in copper is approximately 4.3 × 10^-3 m²/(V·s). Let me confirm that. If I recall, mobility μ is related to conductivity by σ = n e μ. Therefore, μ = σ / (n e). Let me compute that.\n\nUsing σ = 5.96 × 10^7 S/m, n = 8.49 × 10^28 /m³, e = 1.6 × 10^-19 C.\n\nμ = 5.96e7 / (8.49e28 * 1.6e-19) ≈ same as before, 5.96e7 / (1.36e10) ≈ 4.38 × 10^-3 m²/(V·s). Which matches the known value of copper's electron mobility around 4.3 × 10^-3 m²/(V·s). So that seems correct.\n\nThen, using v_d = μ E. E is 100 V/m. So v_d = 4.38 × 10^-3 m²/(V·s) * 100 V/m = 0.438 m/s. Same result. So according to this, the drift velocity is about 0.44 m/s. But I thought drift velocities are much smaller. Wait, maybe in copper with a high electric field, it's higher?\n\nWait, the electric field here is 1 V/cm, which is 100 V/m. Is that a typical electric field? Let me think. For example, in household wiring, the electric field might be lower. Let's see. Suppose you have a copper wire with 120 V and a length of, say, 1 meter. Then electric field would be 120 V/m. So 100 V/m is reasonable. \n\nBut even so, 0.4 m/s seems fast. Let me check with another example. Let's take a standard example: suppose a copper wire with 1 mm radius, 1 meter long, with 1 A current. What is the drift velocity?\n\nFirst, calculate current density J = I / A. Area A = π r². Radius 1 mm = 0.001 m. Area is π*(0.001)^2 ≈ 3.14e-6 m². So J = 1 A / 3.14e-6 m² ≈ 3.18e5 A/m².\n\nThen using J = n e v_d => v_d = J / (n e) = 3.18e5 / (8.49e28 * 1.6e-19) ≈ 3.18e5 / (1.36e10) ≈ 2.34e-5 m/s ≈ 0.0234 mm/s. That's a very slow drift velocity. But in this case, the electric field is E = J / σ = 3.18e5 / 5.96e7 ≈ 5.33e-3 V/m. So a very small electric field gives a small drift velocity. \n\nBut in our problem, the electric field is 100 V/m, which is much larger. Therefore, the drift velocity is higher. So if we have E = 100 V/m, which is much larger than the 0.005 V/m in the previous example, then the drift velocity would be higher by a factor of 100 / 0.00533 ≈ 18,750. So 0.0234 mm/s * 18,750 ≈ 0.439 m/s. Exactly what we calculated. \n\nTherefore, in this case, with a high electric field of 100 V/m, the drift velocity is indeed about 0.44 m/s. So even though it seems high compared to typical low-current situations, in this case with a strong electric field, it's correct. \n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct. The average drift velocity is approximately 0.44 m/s. Let me check with precise numbers again.\n\nLet me redo the calculation with exact numbers.\n\nσ = 5.96 × 10^7 S/m\n\nE = 100 V/m\n\nn = 8.49 × 10^28 electrons/m³\n\ne = 1.602 × 10^-19 C\n\nv_d = σ E / (n e) = (5.96e7 * 100) / (8.49e28 * 1.602e-19)\n\nCalculate numerator: 5.96e7 * 100 = 5.96e9\n\nDenominator: 8.49e28 * 1.602e-19 = 8.49 * 1.602 * 1e9 ≈ 13.597 * 1e9 ≈ 1.3597e10\n\nTherefore, v_d ≈ 5.96e9 / 1.3597e10 ≈ 0.4386 m/s ≈ 0.44 m/s. \n\nSo rounding to two decimal places, maybe 0.44 m/s. However, let me check if the numbers for σ, n are precise. \n\nThe conductivity of copper is often cited as 5.96 × 10^7 S/m, which is correct. The number density n: let me recalculate it precisely.\n\nDensity of copper: 8.96 g/cm³ = 8960 kg/m³. Molar mass of copper: 63.55 g/mol = 0.06355 kg/mol.\n\nNumber of moles per m³: 8960 kg/m³ / 0.06355 kg/mol ≈ 8960 / 0.06355 ≈ let me compute that.\n\nDividing 8960 by 0.06355:\n\nFirst, 8960 / 0.06355 ≈ 8960 / 6.355 × 10^1 ≈ approx 8960 / 6.355 ≈ let's calculate 8960 / 6.355.\n\nWell, 6.355 * 1400 = 6.355 * 1000 + 6.355 * 400 = 6355 + 2542 = 8897. Close to 8960. So approx 1400 + (8960 - 8897)/6.355 ≈ 1400 + 63 / 6.355 ≈ 1400 + 9.9 ≈ 1409.9 mol/m³.\n\nSo approx 1.41 × 10^3 mol/m³? Wait, no:\n\nWait, 8960 / 0.06355 kg/mol is equal to 8960 / 0.06355 ≈ 141,000 mol/m³? Wait, no, let me check units again.\n\nWait, density is 8960 kg/m³. Divided by molar mass 0.06355 kg/mol gives units of mol/m³. So 8960 / 0.06355 ≈ let me compute with calculator steps:\n\nFirst, 0.06355 kg/mol = 63.55 g/mol, which matches. \n\nSo 8.96 g/cm³ = 8960 kg/m³. \n\nMolar mass M = 63.55 g/mol = 0.06355 kg/mol.\n\nNumber of moles per m³ is n_moles = density / M = 8960 / 0.06355 ≈ let me compute 8960 / 0.06355.\n\nLet me write 8960 / 0.06355 ≈ 8960 / 6.355 × 10^1 = (approx 1410) × 10^1? Wait, no:\n\nWait 8960 divided by 0.06355 is equal to 8960 divided by (6.355 × 10^-2) = 8960 / 6.355 × 10^2 ≈ 1410 × 10^2 ≈ 1.41 × 10^5 mol/m³. Yes! Earlier I had 1.41 × 10^5 mol/m³. Then multiplied by Avogadro's number:\n\nn = 1.41 × 10^5 mol/m³ * 6.022 × 10^23 electrons/mol ≈ 8.49 × 10^28 electrons/m³. Correct. So that's accurate.\n\nTherefore, my calculation of n is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation of v_d ≈ 0.44 m/s is correct. So the average drift velocity is approximately 0.44 meters per second. \n\nBut let me check another source or example. For example, according to some references, the drift velocity in copper for 1 A/mm² current density is about 0.024 mm/s. Let me see if that aligns with our calculation. \n\nCurrent density J = 1 A/mm² = 1 A/(1e-6 m²) = 1e6 A/m². \n\nUsing J = σ E => E = J / σ = 1e6 / 5.96e7 ≈ 0.00168 V/m. Then using v_d = μ E, where μ = 4.3e-3 m²/(V·s), so v_d ≈ 4.3e-3 * 0.00168 ≈ 7.2e-6 m/s ≈ 7.2 μm/s. Wait, but earlier example said 0.024 mm/s = 24 μm/s. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, perhaps my value for mobility is wrong? Wait, let me recalculate μ. Earlier, I had μ = σ / (n e). Let me compute that again with precise numbers.\n\nσ = 5.96e7 S/m\n\nn = 8.49e28 /m³\n\ne = 1.602e-19 C\n\nμ = σ / (n e) = 5.96e7 / (8.49e28 * 1.602e-19) ≈ 5.96e7 / (1.36e10) ≈ 4.38e-3 m²/(V·s). So 4.38 × 10^-3 m²/(V·s). \n\nIf E is 0.00168 V/m, then v_d = 4.38e-3 * 0.00168 ≈ 4.38e-3 * 1.68e-3 ≈ 7.35e-6 m/s, which is 7.35 micrometers per second. But according to the example, for J=1e6 A/m², drift velocity should be higher. Wait, maybe I messed up the current density?\n\nWait, J = n e v_d => v_d = J / (n e). For J = 1e6 A/m², v_d = 1e6 / (8.49e28 * 1.602e-19) ≈ 1e6 / 1.36e10 ≈ 7.35e-5 m/s ≈ 73.5 micrometers per second. Which is higher than the 7.2 micrometers/s from before. Wait, why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because when I used μ E, I calculated E from J = σ E, so E = J / σ = 1e6 / 5.96e7 ≈ 0.00168 V/m. Then multiplied by μ = 4.38e-3 m²/(V·s) gives 0.00168 * 4.38e-3 ≈ 7.35e-6 m/s. But when I directly calculate v_d = J / (n e), I get 7.35e-5 m/s. There's a factor of 10 difference. Which is correct?\n\nWait, there must be a miscalculation here. Let me check:\n\nIf μ = σ / (n e), then σ = n e μ. Therefore, J = σ E = n e μ E. But also J = n e v_d, so v_d = μ E. Therefore, both methods should agree. But why in my calculation they don't?\n\nLet me recalculate E = J / σ. J is 1e6 A/m², σ is 5.96e7 S/m. Therefore, E = 1e6 / 5.96e7 ≈ 1 / 59.6 ≈ 0.0168 V/m? Wait earlier I said 0.00168, but that was a miscalculation. Wait 1e6 / 5.96e7 = 1 / 59.6 ≈ 0.0168 V/m, not 0.00168. I must have misplaced a decimal. So E ≈ 0.0168 V/m. Then v_d = μ E = 4.38e-3 * 0.0168 ≈ 4.38e-3 * 1.68e-2 ≈ 7.35e-5 m/s ≈ 73.5 micrometers/s. Which matches the direct calculation. So my earlier mistake was a decimal error. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, in the case of J = 1 A/mm² = 1e6 A/m², drift velocity is ~73 micrometers per second. Which is about 0.073 mm/s. Which is in the ballpark of the 0.024 mm/s I mentioned earlier, depending on exact current density. \n\nTherefore, returning to our original problem, with E = 100 V/m, which is much higher electric field, leading to higher drift velocity. So 0.44 m/s is correct. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check another source or formula. For example, the relation between drift velocity and electric field can also be expressed via the formula:\n\nv_d = (e τ / m) * E\n\nWhere τ is the relaxation time, and m is the electron mass. But since we don't have τ here, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, using mobility μ = e τ / m, so same as before. \n\nAlternatively, I can look up the typical drift velocity for copper under certain conditions. However, since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my calculations. Given that both methods (using J = σ E and J = n e v_d) give consistent results, and cross-checking with mobility gives the same answer, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the average drift velocity is approximately 0.44 m/s. Let me write that with appropriate significant figures. The given electric field is 1.0 V/cm, which is two significant figures. The conductivity and other constants I used have more significant figures, so the result should be two significant figures. Therefore, 0.44 m/s rounds to 0.44 m/s, which is two decimal places but actually two significant figures if the original data is two. Wait, 1.0 V/cm is two significant figures. The other values (σ, n, e) are known with more precision, so the limiting factor is the electric field. Therefore, the answer should be expressed with two significant figures: 0.44 m/s. \n\nBut let me check if there is a standard value or if I need to adjust units. The question asks for the average drift velocity, and the electric field is given in V/cm. I converted it to V/m correctly. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes drift velocity is expressed in cm/s. Let me convert 0.44 m/s to cm/s: 0.44 m/s = 44 cm/s. That seems quite fast, but as discussed earlier, with such a high electric field, it's correct. \n\nBut to confirm, let me think about the relation between electric field and voltage. For example, if you have a copper wire with 1 V applied over 1 cm, then E = 1 V / 0.01 m = 100 V/m, which is our case. So if you have a 1 cm long copper wire with 1 V applied, the electric field is 100 V/m, and the drift velocity is 0.44 m/s. \n\nBut how much current would that produce? Let's calculate. Using J = σ E = 5.96e7 * 100 = 5.96e9 A/m². That's an extremely high current density! For comparison, typical current densities in wires are on the order of 1e6 A/m² or less. For example, 1e6 A/m² is 1 A per mm². Here, J is 5.96e9 A/m², which is 5960 A/mm². That's extremely high and would cause the wire to heat up immensely, likely melting it. \n\nBut the question is purely theoretical, asking for the drift velocity given that electric field. So even though such an electric field would be impractical in real copper wires due to the high current density and heating, the calculation is still valid in the context of the question. \n\nTherefore, despite the high current density, the calculation is correct, and the average drift velocity is approximately 0.44 m/s. \n\nSo my final answer is approximately 0.44 m/s. To express it properly with units and significant figures, it's 0.44 m/s. However, let me check if there is a standard formula or if I missed a constant. \n\nWait, another thought: the formula v_d = μ E. If I use the mobility μ for copper. Let me check standard mobility values. The electron mobility in copper is about 4.3 × 10^-3 m²/(V·s) as we calculated. So with E = 100 V/m, v_d = 4.3 × 10^-3 * 100 = 0.43 m/s. Which is consistent with our previous result. \n\nYes, so that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is approximately 0.44 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average drift velocity of the electrons is \\boxed{0.44} $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n</think>"}
