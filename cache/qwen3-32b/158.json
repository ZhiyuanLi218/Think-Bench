This has several important thermodynamic implications, especially for an ideal gas, which is governed by the ideal gas law and specific assumptions about its behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Key Thermodynamic Properties of an Ideal Gas\n\n1. **Internal Energy (E) of an Ideal Gas**:\n   - For an ideal gas, the internal energy (E) is a function **only of temperature**.\n   - In an isothermal process (constant temperature), the internal energy of the gas does **not** change.\n   - Therefore, the **change in internal energy** is:\n\n     $$\n     \\Delta E = 0\n     $$\n\n2. **First Law of Thermodynamics**:\n   - The first law states:\n\n     $$\n     \\Delta E = q + w\n     $$\n\n     where:\n     - $ \\Delta E $ is the change in internal energy,\n     - $ q $ is the heat added to the system,\n     - $ w $ is the work done **on** the system.\n\n   - Since $ \\Delta E = 0 $ in an isothermal process, it follows that:\n\n     $$\n     q = -w\n     $$\n\n     This means the heat absorbed by the system is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work done by the system.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nLet’s now evaluate the options provided:\n\n- **A: $ q = 0 $**  \n  This would be true in an **adiabatic** process (no heat exchange), not an isothermal one. So this is **incorrect**.\n\n- **B: $ w = 0 $**  \n  This would be true if the gas expands **without doing any work**, which is not the case in a typical isothermal expansion. So this is also **incorrect**.\n\n- **C: $ E = 0 $**  \n  If $ E $ is interpreted as the **change in internal energy** (i.e., $ \\Delta E = 0 $), then this is **correct**. However, if $ E $ is interpreted as the **internal energy itself**, then it is **not zero**. But in the context of a process like expansion, and given that the question is likely using $ E $ to refer to $ \\Delta E $, this option is **valid**.\n\n- **D: $ q = -w $**  \n  This is a **direct consequence** of the first law and the fact that $ \\Delta E = 0 $. It is a **fundamental relationship** in isothermal processes for ideal gases. Therefore, this is **also correct**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWhile both **C** and **D** are correct under the standard interpretation (i.e., $ \\Delta E = 0 $ and $ q = -w $), the question asks:\n\n> \"Which one of the following is true?\"\n\nThis implies a **single correct answer** is expected. In such cases, **D** is often the preferred and more directly relevant answer when discussing isothermal processes. It emphasizes the **relationship between heat and work**, which is a key insight in the first law and the behavior of ideal gases.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D: q = -w}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these statements is true when an ideal gas expands isothermally. Let me start by recalling what an isothermal process means. Isothermal means the temperature is constant, right? So for an ideal gas, the internal energy (E) depends only on temperature. Since the temperature doesn't change during an isothermal process, the internal energy change (ΔE) should be zero. That might relate to one of the options here. Let me check the options again: C says E = 0, which I think refers to ΔE = 0. So maybe C is correct? But wait, let me not jump to conclusions.\n\nNow, when a gas expands, it's doing work on the surroundings. In an isothermal expansion, since the temperature is constant, the gas must be absorbing heat from the surroundings to keep the internal energy constant. So heat (q) should be positive, and work (w) should be negative because the system is doing work. The first law of thermodynamics is ΔE = q + w. Since ΔE is zero for isothermal processes, that would mean q = -w. So that would mean option D is correct: q = -w. But then why is option C there? Let me verify.\n\nOption C says E = 0. If E refers to the change in internal energy, then yes, ΔE = 0. But the problem is written as \"E = 0\". Depending on notation, sometimes E is used for internal energy, and ΔE would be the change. If the question is using E to mean the change in internal energy, then C is correct. But if E is the internal energy itself, then E wouldn't be zero unless the system has no internal energy, which isn't the case. However, in standard notation, ΔE is the change. The question might be using E to represent ΔE, which is common in some textbooks. So both C and D could be correct? Wait, but the options are A to D, and we have to pick one. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first law, ΔE = q + w. For an isothermal process, ΔE = 0, so q = -w. Therefore, both ΔE = 0 (option C) and q = -w (option D) are correct. But looking at the options given, the question is probably expecting only one correct answer. Wait, maybe the question is from a source where only one answer is correct. Let me check the options again: A: q=0, which would be true for adiabatic processes, not isothermal. B: w=0, which would be if the gas expands against zero pressure, but that's not isothermal. C: E=0 (assuming ΔE=0), which is true. D: q=-w, which is also true. But maybe in some contexts, the question is only looking for one answer. Wait, but both C and D are correct? Let me check the standard questions. In standard thermodynamics problems, for an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the internal energy change is zero, so ΔE=0, and q=-w. So both statements are true. However, looking at the options given, maybe the question is designed such that only one is correct. Wait, perhaps the options are presented as single-choice. Let me check the original question again: \"Which one of the following is true?\" So it's a single answer. Therefore, maybe there is a trick here.\n\nWait, in some cases, when they say \"E = 0\", if E is the internal energy itself, then it's not zero. But if E refers to the change in internal energy, then yes. So depending on notation. In many textbooks, ΔE is the change, and they might write ΔE = q + w. If the question uses E to mean ΔE, then C is correct. But if they use E as the internal energy itself, then E isn't zero. However, in most cases, when you see E in the context of the first law without a delta, it's often the change. For example, in the first law, it's written as ΔE = q + w. But sometimes, people might just write E for ΔE. So if the question is using E to mean ΔE, then C is correct. However, D is also correct because q = -w. But since the question asks for \"which one\", maybe both C and D are correct? But in the options given, only one can be correct. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where only one answer is considered correct. Let me think again. For an isothermal process of an ideal gas, ΔE is zero. Therefore, C is correct. Also, since ΔE = q + w = 0, then q = -w, so D is also correct. But if the question is multiple choice and only allows one answer, perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the options are presented differently. Let me check the original options again: A: q=0, B:w=0, C:E=0, D:q=-w. So if both C and D are correct, but the question is a single answer, then there's a problem. However, in standard exams, such as the AP or GRE, usually only one answer is correct. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the question is about the internal energy (E) being zero, not the change. But that doesn't make sense because the internal energy of an ideal gas isn't zero. The internal energy change is zero. So if the question is using E to mean the change in internal energy, then C is correct. But if the question is using E to mean the internal energy itself, then it's not zero. However, given that in the first law, ΔE is the change, and the question is about a process (expansion), it's more likely that E here refers to ΔE. Therefore, C is correct. But also D is correct. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, let me look up standard thermodynamics problems. For example, in an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, which of the following is true? The standard answers are that ΔE = 0 and q = -w. Therefore, both C and D are correct. However, if the options are presented as single-choice, there might be a mistake in the question. But since the user provided the options as A to D, and asks for one correct answer, perhaps there's a convention here. Maybe in the context of the question, only one is considered correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where E refers to the internal energy, not the change. But in that case, E wouldn't be zero. So that can't be. Therefore, it's more likely that the question is using E to mean ΔE. In that case, both C and D are correct. However, if I have to choose between them, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A to D. If the question is from a source where only one is correct, perhaps the intended answer is D: q = -w. Because in many textbooks, when they talk about isothermal processes, they emphasize that the heat absorbed is equal to the work done by the system. However, ΔE = 0 is also a fundamental point. Maybe the question is testing the understanding of the first law. If the question is from a chapter that focuses on the first law, then both C and D are correct. But if it's a multiple-choice question where only one answer is allowed, then perhaps the intended answer is D. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source where E refers to the internal energy, not the change. But that would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a context where E is the internal energy, and the question is about the internal energy being zero. But for an ideal gas, the internal energy isn't zero; it's (3/2)nRT for monatomic gases. So unless the temperature is zero, which it's not in an expansion, E isn't zero. Therefore, option C is incorrect if E refers to the internal energy itself. However, if E refers to the change in internal energy, then it is zero. Therefore, the notation is crucial here. In most thermodynamics problems, when you see E without a delta, it's often the internal energy itself. However, in the context of the first law, ΔE is the change. But the problem states \"which one of the following is true?\" when the gas expands isothermally. So if E refers to the change in internal energy, then C is correct. But if it refers to the internal energy itself, then it's not. Given that the options are A-D, and the question is likely from a standard test, I think the intended answer is C: E = 0 (meaning ΔE = 0), and D: q = -w is also correct. However, since the question asks for one answer, maybe the primary one is C. But I need to check standard multiple-choice questions.\n\nLooking up similar questions, for example, in standard textbooks like University Physics or Physical Chemistry, for an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the correct statements are that the internal energy change is zero and that q equals negative work. Therefore, both C and D are correct. However, if the options are presented as single-choice, there might be a mistake. But given that the user has presented this as a single-answer question, perhaps the intended answer is D: q = -w. Because sometimes in such questions, they focus on the relationship between heat and work rather than the internal energy change. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source where E is the internal energy and not the change, making C incorrect. Given the ambiguity, but knowing that for an ideal gas ΔE = 0 for isothermal processes, I think the correct answers are both C and D. But since the user asks for one, and the options are given as single-choice, I need to infer which one is more likely expected.\n\nIn many cases, when you have an isothermal process, the key point is that the heat transferred is equal to the work done, hence q = -w. So perhaps D is the intended answer. However, if the question is from a chapter that emphasizes internal energy, then C is correct. Given that the options are A to D, and the question is likely from a general chemistry perspective, the answer is probably D. But I'm a bit confused because both are correct. Let me check another angle. For an isothermal process, ΔE = 0 always for ideal gases. So regardless of the process (expansion or compression), ΔE is zero. Therefore, C is always true for isothermal processes of ideal gases. D is also true because of the first law. Therefore, both are correct. But if only one answer is allowed, maybe the question is designed to have multiple correct answers, but the user hasn't indicated that. Since the user is asking for one answer, and given that in some educational materials, they might emphasize different aspects, I think the safest answer is D: q = -w, because it directly relates the heat and work, which are the variables in the options. However, I'm still torn because C is also correct. Given that, I think the correct answers are both C and D, but since the user asks for one, and given that in the first law, ΔE = 0 leads to q = -w, maybe the primary answer is D. But I need to make a decision here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where E is the internal energy, not the change. In that case, E isn't zero, so C is incorrect. Therefore, D is the correct answer. Given that ambiguity in notation, but assuming that the question is using E to mean the internal energy itself, which isn't zero, then D is correct. However, if E refers to the change, then C is correct. Since the question is about a process (expansion), it's more likely referring to the change. Therefore, I think the correct answers are C and D. But since the user has to choose one, maybe the intended answer is D. Given the options, I'll go with D: q = -w as the correct answer.\n</think>"}
