The reaction given is between ethanol (C₂H₅OH) and hydrobromic acid (HBr) to form ethyl bromide (C₂H₅Br) and water (H₂O). It's an equilibrium reaction, so we need to consider Le Chatelier's principle for the effects of changes on the equilibrium.\n\nFirst, let me recall the boiling points: C₂H₅Br boils at 38.4°C and ethanol at 78.5°C. That might be relevant for distillation or volatility, but maybe not directly for the equilibrium unless the reaction is being carried out under conditions where some substances are being removed. But the question is about the statements regarding the reaction at equilibrium.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Adding NaOH can increase the amount of ethanol.\n\nIf we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it would react with HBr (a strong acid) to form NaBr and water. So, HBr is a reactant here. If we remove HBr by adding NaOH, according to Le Chatelier's principle, the system would shift to the left to produce more HBr and ethanol. Therefore, adding NaOH would decrease the amount of C₂H₅Br and increase the amount of ethanol. So option A seems correct. So A is a correct statement, so it's not the incorrect one we're looking for.\n\nOption B: Increasing the concentration of HBr is conducive to the formation of C₂H₅Br.\n\nIncreasing the concentration of a reactant (HBr) should shift the equilibrium to the right, producing more products. Therefore, more C₂H₅Br would be formed. So B is a correct statement. So B is not the incorrect one.\n\nOption C: If both reactants are increased to 2 mol, the ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants remains unchanged.\n\nHmm. Let's think. Initially, there's 1 mol each of ethanol and HBr. Suppose the reaction goes to some extent where x moles of each react. At equilibrium, conversion for each would be x/1 = x. If we double the amount of both reactants to 2 mol each, and let the reaction proceed, the new conversion would be y/2. The question is whether the ratio of their conversion rates (i.e., x for original vs y for the new) would have the same ratio? Wait, the statement says the \"ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants remains unchanged.\" Wait, since both reactants are in 1:1 stoichiometry, their conversion rates (i.e., how much they convert) should be the same in any case. Because for every mole of ethanol reacting, one mole of HBr reacts. So if you start with 1 mol each, their conversion rates (as in percentage) might depend on the equilibrium. If you double both, the conversion rate (as in percentage) might change, but since they are still in 1:1 ratio, their conversion rates would be the same as each other. The statement says \"the ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants remains unchanged.\" Wait, if they are both converted by the same fraction, their ratio of conversion rates (each divided by their initial amounts) would be the same as 1:1? Or maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose in the original case, the conversion rate for ethanol is α (so [ethanol] converted is α*1 mol). Similarly for HBr, it's also α*1 mol. So the conversion rate (as in fraction) is α for both. If you double both to 2 mol each, then let’s say the conversion is β. Then the fraction converted for each is β/2. But the question is about the ratio of the conversion rates. Wait, maybe the conversion rate here refers to the amount converted, not the fraction. For example, original conversion is x moles for each. When you double the initial amounts, the conversion is y moles for each. The ratio of the conversion rates (x for ethanol and x for HBr) would be x/x = 1 in original. In the new case, y/y = 1. Therefore, the ratio remains 1. So the ratio of the conversion rates (of the two reactants) remains unchanged. Therefore, statement C is correct? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"conversion rates\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"conversion rate\" here refers to the fraction converted. For example, if in the original case, the equilibrium conversion is α for both. When you double the amount, the new equilibrium conversion might be different. For example, if the reaction is not at 100% conversion, increasing the amount might affect the conversion fraction. But since both are increased proportionally, maybe the conversion fraction remains the same? Let me think about the equilibrium expression.\n\nThe reaction is C₂H₅OH + HBr ⇌ C₂H₅Br + H₂O. Let's assume the equilibrium constant K is [C₂H₅Br][H₂O]/([C₂H₅OH][HBr]).\n\nIf we start with 1 mol each of ethanol and HBr, and let x be the amount reacted, then at equilibrium:\n\n[C₂H₅OH] = 1 - x\n\n[HBr] = 1 - x\n\n[C₂H₅Br] = x\n\n[H₂O] = x\n\nSo K = (x²)/[(1 - x)²]\n\nNow, if we double the initial amounts to 2 mol each, then:\n\n[C₂H₅OH] = 2 - y\n\n[HBr] = 2 - y\n\n[C₂H₅Br] = y\n\n[H₂O] = y\n\nSo K = (y²)/[(2 - y)²]\n\nSince K is the same, we can set up:\n\n(x²)/(1 - x)² = (y²)/(2 - y)²\n\nTaking square roots:\n\nx/(1 - x) = y/(2 - y)\n\nSo solving for y:\n\ny = [2x - x²]/(1 + x)\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants. Since both reactants are in 1:1 ratio and their conversion amounts are same (x in first case, y in second case), their conversion rates (as in fraction) would be x/1 and y/2. The ratio of these fractions would be (x/1)/(y/2) = 2x/y. But according to the above equation, x/(1 - x) = y/(2 - y). Let me see if this ratio 2x/y is a constant.\n\nSuppose in the original case, let’s assume some K value. Let me take an example. Let’s suppose K is 4. Then in the original case:\n\nx/(1 - x) = 2, so x = 2(1 - x) => x = 2 - 2x => 3x = 2 => x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667\n\nSo conversion fraction is 2/3.\n\nIn the second case, with initial 2 mol each, K is still 4, so y/(2 - y) = 2 => y = 2(2 - y) => y = 4 - 2y => 3y = 4 => y = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 mol.\n\nConversion fraction is y/2 = (4/3)/2 = 2/3. So same as before. Therefore, the conversion fraction (i.e., fraction converted) remains same. Therefore, the ratio of the conversion rates (if conversion rate refers to fraction converted) for the two reactants would still be 1:1, same as before. Therefore, the ratio remains unchanged. So statement C is correct. Therefore, option C is correct, so it's not the incorrect one.\n\nOption D: If the initial temperature is raised to 60°C, it can shorten the time for the reaction to reach equilibrium.\n\nIncreasing temperature generally increases the reaction rate, so the time to reach equilibrium would be shorter. However, we need to know if the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. Because if the reaction is exothermic, increasing temperature would shift the equilibrium to the left, but regardless, the rate would be faster. The question is about the time to reach equilibrium, not the position. So even if the equilibrium position changes, the rate is faster at higher temperature. Therefore, statement D is correct. So D is a correct statement, so it's not the incorrect one.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the following statements are incorrect\". So we need to find the one that is incorrect. So far, all options A, B, C, D seem correct? But that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in analyzing option C.\n\nWait, let me check option C again. The statement says: \"If both reactants are increased to 2 mol, the ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants remains unchanged.\"\n\nEarlier, with the example, when K was 4, the conversion fraction (i.e., fraction converted) remained the same. Therefore, the conversion rate (as in fraction) for both reactants is same as before, so their ratio is same (1:1). Therefore, statement C is correct. But maybe the question is using \"conversion rates\" in a different way? Or perhaps there's a case where the ratio changes?\n\nWait, but suppose the reaction is not 1:1? But in this case, it is 1:1. So if you start with equimolar amounts and double them, the conversion fractions remain same. Therefore, the ratio of their conversion rates (each to their initial) remains same. Hence, the ratio remains unchanged. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\nBut then all options are correct? But the question says \"the following statements are incorrect\", so there must be one incorrect. Maybe my analysis of option C is wrong?\n\nWait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think again. The conversion rate of each reactant is the amount converted divided by the initial amount. For the original case, let's say conversion rate for ethanol is α = x/1, and for HBr also α = x/1. The ratio of their conversion rates is α/α = 1. In the case where we have 2 mol each, conversion rate for ethanol is β = y/2 and for HBr also β = y/2. The ratio is still 1. So the ratio remains unchanged. Therefore, statement C is correct. Hence, all options A, B, C, D are correct? But the problem must have one incorrect. Maybe I made a mistake in D?\n\nOption D: Raising the temperature to 60°C shortens the time to reach equilibrium. Well, higher temperature increases the rate of reaction, so yes, it would reach equilibrium faster. Unless the reaction is somehow negatively affected by temperature? But generally, increasing temperature increases the rate, regardless of whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. So D is correct.\n\nWait, but what if the reaction is exothermic? Then increasing temperature would shift the equilibrium to the left, but the rate is still faster. The question is about time to reach equilibrium, not the position. So D is correct.\n\nSo if all options are correct, but the question says one is incorrect. Then perhaps my analysis of option C is wrong? Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to the \"conversion rates\" as in the rate of conversion, not the extent. But no, the wording is \"equilibrium conversion rates\", which likely refers to the extent of conversion at equilibrium. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the conversion rates is not 1:1? For example, if the stoichiometry was different. But here it's 1:1. So their conversion rates (as in amount converted) are same. Therefore, their ratio is 1:1 in both cases. Therefore, the ratio remains unchanged. So statement C is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe when you increase the amount of both reactants, the conversion rate (as in the percentage) changes? But in my example with K=4, the conversion fraction remained same. So if K is fixed, then when you scale the initial concentrations proportionally, the conversion fraction remains same. Therefore, the ratio of their conversion rates (which are same for both reactants) remains same. So statement C is correct. Then why is this a question? There must be an incorrect statement here. Maybe I made a mistake in another option?\n\nLet me check option A again. Adding NaOH would neutralize HBr, removing it from the reaction. So the system would shift left to produce more HBr and ethanol. Therefore, the amount of ethanol would increase. So A is correct.\n\nOption B: Increasing HBr concentration shifts right, producing more C₂H₅Br. Correct.\n\nOption D: Higher temperature increases rate, so shorter time. Correct.\n\nSo all options are correct? But the problem says one is incorrect. Maybe I missed something?\n\nWait, the reaction is between ethanol and HBr. Ethanol is a liquid, HBr is aqueous. The reaction is likely to be in solution. However, the boiling point of C₂H₅Br is 38.4°C, which is lower than room temperature? Wait, room temperature is about 20-25°C. If the boiling point of C₂H₅Br is 38.4°C, then at room temperature, it's a liquid but volatile. However, if during the reaction, some of the C₂H₅Br evaporates, that would remove product, shifting the equilibrium to the right. But the question says \"reaching equilibrium after fully reacting.\" Wait, maybe the problem assumes that no substances are being removed? If the reaction is carried out in a closed system, then the evaporation wouldn't affect. But if it's an open system, then C₂H₅Br might evaporate, which would drive the reaction to the right. However, the question doesn't specify whether it's closed or open. But the problem states that the reaction reaches equilibrium, implying that it's a closed system where all substances are present. Therefore, maybe the boiling points are just extra info.\n\nBut maybe option C is incorrect? Let me think again. Suppose the reaction is not 1:1 in terms of conversion? Wait, no, the stoichiometry is 1:1. If you have equimolar amounts initially, then their conversion amounts are same. If you double both, they are still equimolar, so same conversion amounts. Therefore, the ratio of their conversion rates (i.e., each's conversion divided by initial) is same for both reactants in both cases. Therefore, the ratio remains unchanged. So C is correct. \n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to the conversion rate as in the rate of reaction, not the extent? Like, how fast they convert? But no, the wording is \"equilibrium conversion rates\", which refers to at equilibrium, how much has been converted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is incorrect because when you increase the amount of both reactants, the conversion rate (as in the fraction) changes? But in my example with K=4, it didn't. Unless K is different. Let me try with a different K. Suppose K is 1. Original case: x/(1 - x) = 1 => x = 1 - x => x = 0.5. Conversion fraction 0.5. With 2 mol each: y/(2 - y) = 1 => y = 2 - y => y = 1. Conversion fraction is 1/2 = 0.5. Same as before. So yes, conversion fraction remains same. Hence, the ratio of the conversion rates (which is 1:1) remains same. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\nHmm. If all options are correct, then maybe the question has a mistake. But since the user is asking for the answer, and the options are A, B, C, D, with one being incorrect, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, maybe option C is incorrect because when you increase the amount of both reactants, the conversion rates (as in the actual amounts converted) double? For example, if originally x moles converted, now 2x moles converted. But in reality, with K being same, when you double the initial amounts, the amount converted depends on K. In my previous example with K=4, when initial was 1 mol, x=2/3 ≈0.6667. When initial is 2 mol, y=4/3 ≈1.333, which is double. Wait, no, 4/3 is 1.333, which is double of 2/3 (which is 0.666). So yes, the amount converted doubles. But the conversion rate (as in fraction) remains same. So the ratio of the conversion rates (if \"conversion rates\" refers to the amount converted) between the two reactants is still 1:1, since both converted same amount. Therefore, the ratio remains unchanged. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"the ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants remains unchanged\". If \"conversion rates\" here refers to the amount converted, then for both reactants it's same, so ratio is 1:1 in both cases. Hence, ratio remains same. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nSo all statements are correct? But the question says one is incorrect. Maybe I made a mistake in option D?\n\nOption D says raising temperature to 60°C shortens the time to reach equilibrium. Well, higher temperature increases the rate, so it should be correct. Unless the reaction is too fast and becomes diffusion-controlled or something, but generally, higher temperature increases rate.\n\nWait, but what if the reaction is exothermic? Then increasing temperature would decrease the yield, but the question is about time to reach equilibrium, not yield. So even if it's exothermic, the rate is still faster at higher temperature. Hence, D is correct.\n\nIs there any possibility that one of these is incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe option C is incorrect. Suppose the reaction is not ideal or there's some activity coefficient changes? But in the absence of specific information, we assume ideal behavior. Also, in the example calculations, when doubling the initial moles, the conversion fraction remained same. Hence, the ratio of the conversion rates (which is 1:1) remains same. So C is correct.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in Chinese and there's a translation issue? The original problem mentions \"the ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants remains unchanged\". Maybe \"conversion rates\" here refers to something else. For example, if the conversion rate is defined as the rate at which they convert (i.e., the speed), but at equilibrium, the rates are zero. No, that doesn't make sense. It must refer to the extent of conversion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is saying that if you increase both reactants to 2 mol, the ratio of their conversion rates (i.e., α for ethanol / α for HBr) remains the same as before. Which it does, because they are always equal. Hence, the ratio is 1 in both cases. So C is correct.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the incorrect statement is none of them, but since the question says one is incorrect, I must have made a mistake. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, maybe option C is incorrect because when you increase both reactants, the conversion rates (fractions) are not the same? But no, in the example they were same. Wait, suppose the reaction is not 1:1? No, the reaction is 1:1. So their conversions are same. Therefore, the ratio remains same.\n\nWait, unless the initial amounts are not in stoichiometric ratio. But in this case, they are both 1 mol initially, so stoichiometric. When doubled to 2 mol each, still stoichiometric. Hence, same conversion fractions. Hence, C is correct.\n\nMaybe the problem is with option A? Let me think again. Adding NaOH would neutralize HBr, decreasing its concentration. The system shifts left, producing more ethanol. So adding NaOH increases the amount of ethanol. So A is correct.\n\nHmm. All options seem correct. But since the question asks for the incorrect one, perhaps I missed something. Let me check the boiling points again. C₂H₅Br boils at 38.4°C, which is lower than ethanol's 78.5°C. If during the reaction, the C₂H₅Br is being distilled off (if the reaction is carried out with distillation), then removing product would shift the equilibrium to the right. However, the question states that the reaction reaches equilibrium after fully reacting, implying that it's a closed system where no substances are being removed. Hence, the boiling points might be a red herring.\n\nBut maybe option D is incorrect? Suppose raising the temperature to 60°C causes some side reactions or decomposition? But the question doesn't mention that. Without additional info, we can't assume that. The standard Le Chatelier principle says increasing temperature increases rate, so D is correct.\n\nWait, another angle: the reaction might be exothermic or endothermic. If it's exothermic, increasing temperature would shift equilibrium left, but the question is about time to reach equilibrium, not position. So D is still correct.\n\nGiven all this, I'm forced to conclude that maybe all statements are correct, but since the question says one is incorrect, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C. But why?\n\nWait, let me think about the mathematical expression again. The conversion rate (as in fraction) for each reactant is α = x/n_initial. In the first case, n_initial = 1, so α₁ = x. In the second case, n_initial = 2, and the amount converted is y, so α₂ = y/2. From earlier, we saw that if K is the same, then x/(1 - x) = y/(2 - y). Let me solve for α₂ in terms of α₁.\n\nLet me denote α₁ = x/1 = x. Then from the equation:\n\nα₁ / (1 - α₁) = (y/2) / (1 - y/2) = α₂ / (1 - α₂)\n\nTherefore, α₁/(1 - α₁) = α₂/(1 - α₂)\n\nThis implies that α₁ = α₂.\n\nTherefore, the conversion fraction (α) remains the same. Hence, the ratio of the conversion rates (which are same for both reactants, hence ratio 1:1) remains unchanged. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\nTherefore, all options are correct? But that's impossible. Maybe the question is flawed? Or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe option C is incorrect because when you increase both reactants, the conversion rates (fractions) are not the same? But mathematically, they are same.\n\nWait, let me take a numerical example. Suppose K is very large, say K approaches infinity, meaning reaction goes to completion. Original case: 1 mol each. They react completely, x = 1. Conversion fraction α = 1. If we double to 2 mol each, they also react completely, y = 2. Conversion fraction α = 2/2 = 1. Same as before. Hence, ratio of conversion rates (1:1) remains same.\n\nAnother example: K approaches zero. Then x approaches 0. Conversion fraction α approaches 0. If we double the initial amounts, y also approaches 0. Conversion fraction α approaches 0. Same as before. Hence, ratio remains same.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the ratio remains same. Hence, statement C is correct.\n\nGiven all this, I'm forced to conclude that all statements are correct, but since the question asks for the incorrect one, perhaps there is a mistake in the question. However, since this is unlikely, I must have made an error.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem: the reaction is between ethanol and HBr. HBr is a strong acid, and ethanol is a weak base? The reaction is likely to be an acid-base reaction? Or is it a substitution reaction? Ethanol reacting with HBr to form ethyl bromide and water is a substitution reaction where the hydroxyl group is replaced by bromide. This reaction is typically acid-catalyzed and may have a certain mechanism. However, the equilibrium and Le Chatelier principles still apply.\n\nWait, but maybe the reaction is not 1:1 in terms of stoichiometry? Let me check: C₂H₅OH + HBr → C₂H₅Br + H₂O. Yes, it's 1:1. So stoichiometry is correct.\n\nMaybe the problem is with option C's wording: \"the ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants remains unchanged\". If the conversion rate for each is α for both, then their ratio is 1, and it remains 1, so unchanged. Hence, correct.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Since all seem correct, but the question requires one incorrect, perhaps the intended answer is C, and the mistake is in assuming that doubling the reactants keeps the same conversion fraction. Maybe in reality, due to activity coefficients or something else, it doesn't. But in ideal conditions, it does. Given that this is a textbook problem, likely assuming ideal behavior, then C is correct. Hence, perhaps the incorrect statement is none, but since it's multiple choice, I must pick one. Given that, and possibly the test-maker intended option C to be incorrect, perhaps due to a misunderstanding that increasing both reactants would change the ratio. But according to the math, it doesn't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the \"conversion rates\" as in the rate at which they convert, not the extent. But at equilibrium, the rates are equal and opposite, so that doesn't make sense. \n\nGiven the information, I think the most likely incorrect statement is C, but according to my analysis, it's correct. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A? No, A is correct. B is correct. D is correct. So I'm confused. But since the user asks for an answer, and given that in some cases, when you increase both reactants, the conversion rates (fractions) might not remain same if the reaction is not first order or something, but in this case, it's a 1:1 reaction and assuming ideal, it should. Given that, I think the intended incorrect answer is C, but I'm not sure. Or maybe there's another angle.\n\nWait, the question says \"the ratio of the equilibrium conversion rates of the two reactants remains unchanged\". If initially, the conversion rates (fractions) are α and α (same for both), and after doubling, they are still α and α, then the ratio is 1:1 in both cases, so it's unchanged. Hence, C is correct. Therefore, all are correct? But the question says one is incorrect. This is perplexing. Maybe there's a typo in the options?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is A? Let me think again. Adding NaOH would neutralize HBr, decreasing its concentration. The system shifts left, producing more ethanol. Hence, the amount of ethanol increases. So A is correct. \n\nMaybe the answer is D? If the reaction is exothermic, increasing temperature would shift equilibrium left, decreasing the amount of products. But the question is about the time to reach equilibrium, not the amount. So D is still correct. \n\nGiven that, I'm forced to conclude that perhaps the intended answer is C, but according to my analysis, it's correct. Alternatively, the problem might have a mistake. Given that, and since I need to provide an answer, I'll go with option C being incorrect, assuming that there's a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing. But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A? No, A makes sense. B is correct. D is correct. \n\nWait, another thought: when you add NaOH, it neutralizes HBr, but HBr is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. NaOH is a strong base, so it would neutralize HBr, forming NaBr and water. But the reaction is C₂H₅OH + HBr ⇌ C₂H₅Br + H₂O. If we remove HBr, the system shifts left, producing more ethanol. Hence, A is correct. \n\nGiven all this, I think the only possible incorrect statement is C, but I can't see why. Maybe the question meant to say \"the ratio of the equilibrium amounts\" instead of \"conversion rates\"? If it were about amounts, then doubling the initial amounts would double the amounts converted, so the ratio would still be same (1:1). Hence, still unchanged. \n\nI'm really stuck. Given the options, and my analysis, I think the answer must be C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A, but no. Given that, I'll go with option C as the incorrect one, possibly due to a misunderstanding in the problem's phrasing, even though mathematically it seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
