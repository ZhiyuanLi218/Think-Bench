The problem gives me some information: the planet's volume is 4.7 times Earth's, its mass is 25 times Earth's, and there's a near-Earth satellite with a period of 1.4 hours. They also give the gravitational constant G. The options for density are given, so I need to calculate it and see which one matches.\n\nFirst, let me recall what average density means. Density is mass divided by volume. The problem says the planet's mass is 25 times Earth's and its volume is 4.7 times Earth's. So, if I can find Earth's density, I can just multiply by 25/4.7 to get the planet's density. But wait, do I need to calculate Earth's density first? Or can I relate it using the given satellite period?\n\nHmm, maybe the satellite period is a hint to use Kepler's laws or something related to orbital mechanics. Let me think. The period of a satellite orbiting a planet depends on the planet's mass. Since they gave me the satellite's period around Earth, maybe I can use that to find Earth's density, and then use that to find the planet's density?\n\nLet me recall the formula for the period of a satellite in a circular orbit. The orbital period T is related to the radius of the orbit r and the mass of the planet M by the equation:\n\nT² = (4π²/GM) * r³\n\nBut since we're talking about a near-Earth satellite, the radius of the orbit is approximately equal to the Earth's radius, right? Because if it's a low orbit satellite, the altitude is negligible compared to Earth's radius. So, if I can write the formula for Earth's density using this information, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nDensity ρ is mass over volume. For Earth, ρ_earth = M_earth / V_earth. But how does that relate to the satellite's period?\n\nLet me try substituting M_earth = ρ_earth * V_earth into the period equation. Also, since the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πR³, so V_earth = (4/3)πR_earth³. Therefore, M_earth = ρ_earth * (4/3)πR_earth³.\n\nPlugging that into the period formula:\n\nT² = (4π² / [G * ρ_earth * (4/3)πR_earth³]) * r³\n\nBut since r ≈ R_earth for a near-Earth satellite, we can substitute r with R_earth.\n\nSo:\n\nT² = [4π² / (G * ρ_earth * (4/3)πR_earth³)] * R_earth³\n\nSimplifying:\n\nThe R_earth³ cancels out:\n\nT² = [4π² / (G * ρ_earth * 4/3 π)] \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe 4π² divided by 4π/3 is 4π² * 3/(4π) ) = 3π.\n\nTherefore:\n\nT² = 3π / (G * ρ_earth)\n\nSo solving for ρ_earth:\n\nρ_earth = 3π / (G * T²)\n\nOh! So that's a formula for the density of a planet based on the orbital period of a satellite very close to it. That's clever. So if I can calculate Earth's density using the given period of 1.4 hours, then I can use the mass and volume ratios of the new planet to find its density.\n\nLet me check the units. G is in N m²/kg², which is m³/(kg s²). T is in hours, but I need to convert that to seconds to keep the units consistent.\n\nFirst, let me convert T from hours to seconds. 1.4 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 1.4 * 3600. Let me calculate that:\n\n1.4 * 3600 = 5040 seconds.\n\nSo T = 5040 s.\n\nNow plug into the formula:\n\nρ_earth = 3π / [G * T²]\n\nLet me compute the denominator first: G*T².\n\nG = 6.67e-11 m³/(kg s²)\n\nT² = (5040)^2 s². Let me compute that:\n\n5040 squared. Let me calculate 5000² = 25,000,000, and then add (2*5000*40 + 40²) = 400,000 + 1,600 = 401,600. So total is 25,000,000 + 401,600 = 25,401,600. Wait, but actually, 5040 squared is (5.04e3)^2 = 25.4016e6 = 2.54016e7 s². Let me confirm with calculator steps:\n\n5040 * 5040:\n\nWell, 5000*5000 = 25,000,000\n\n5000*40 = 200,000\n\n40*5000 = 200,000\n\n40*40 = 1,600\n\nSo total is 25,000,000 + 2*200,000 + 1,600 = 25,000,000 + 400,000 + 1,600 = 25,401,600 seconds². So yes, 2.54016 × 10^7 s².\n\nSo G*T² = 6.67e-11 m³/(kg s²) * 2.54016e7 s² = Let me compute that:\n\nMultiply 6.67e-11 * 2.54016e7.\n\nFirst, 6.67 * 2.54 ≈ let me approximate. 6.67 * 2.5 is 16.675, and 6.67 * 0.04 ≈ 0.2668, so total ≈ 16.675 + 0.2668 ≈ 16.9418.\n\nSo approximately 16.94 × 10^(-11 + 7) = 16.94 × 10^-4 m³/kg.\n\nSo 16.94e-4 m³/kg.\n\nThen ρ_earth = 3π / (16.94e-4) kg/m³.\n\nCompute 3π ≈ 9.4248.\n\nSo 9.4248 / 16.94e-4 ≈ Let me compute that division.\n\nFirst, 16.94e-4 is 0.001694.\n\nSo 9.4248 / 0.001694 ≈ Let me divide 9.4248 by 0.001694.\n\nWell, dividing by 0.001 is multiplying by 1000, so 9.4248 / 0.001694 ≈ (9.4248 / 0.001) * (0.001 / 0.001694) = 9424.8 * (1 / 1.694) ≈ 9424.8 / 1.694 ≈ Let me compute that.\n\nDivide 9424.8 by 1.694. Let me approximate:\n\n1.694 × 5500 = 1.694 × 5000 + 1.694 × 500 = 8470 + 847 = 9317. That's close to 9424.8. The difference is 9424.8 - 9317 = 107.8. So 1.694 × x = 107.8. x ≈ 107.8 / 1.694 ≈ approx 63.6. So total is 5500 + 63.6 ≈ 5563.6 kg/m³.\n\nSo ρ_earth ≈ 5.56 × 10³ kg/m³. Wait, that seems familiar. Earth's actual average density is about 5514 kg/m³, so this approximation is in the right ballpark. Given that I approximated 6.67 * 2.54 as 16.94, maybe there's some rounding here.\n\nBut let me check with more precise numbers.\n\nLet me redo the calculation with more precision.\n\nFirst, G*T²:\n\nG = 6.67 × 10^-11\n\nT² = (5040)^2 = 25,401,600 s².\n\nSo G*T² = 6.67e-11 * 2.54016e7 = 6.67 * 2.54016 × 10^(-11 + 7) = 6.67 * 2.54016 × 10^-4.\n\nCalculating 6.67 * 2.54016:\n\nLet me compute 6 * 2.54016 = 15.24096\n\n0.67 * 2.54016 = Let's compute 0.6*2.54016 = 1.524096 and 0.07*2.54016 ≈ 0.1778112. Adding together: 1.524096 + 0.1778112 ≈ 1.7019072\n\nTotal is 15.24096 + 1.7019072 ≈ 16.9428672 × 10^-4 m³/kg.\n\nSo that's approximately 1.69428672 × 10^-3 m³/kg. Wait, no, 16.9428672 × 10^-4 is same as 1.69428672 × 10^-3.\n\nThen ρ_earth = 3π / (1.69428672 × 10^-3) kg/m³.\n\nCompute 3π ≈ 9.42477.\n\nSo 9.42477 / 1.69428672 × 10^3 ≈ Let me compute 9.42477 / 1.69428672 first.\n\nDividing 9.42477 by 1.69428672:\n\nLet me do this division step by step. Let me approximate:\n\n1.69428672 × 5.5 = 1.69428672 × 5 + 1.69428672 × 0.5 = 8.4714336 + 0.84714336 ≈ 9.31857696. That's very close to 9.42477. The difference is 9.42477 - 9.31857696 ≈ 0.106193. So how much more do we need to add to 5.5?\n\nEach 1 unit in multiplier adds 1.69428672. So 0.106193 / 1.69428672 ≈ approx 0.0627. Therefore total multiplier is 5.5 + 0.0627 ≈ 5.5627. Therefore, ρ_earth ≈ 5.5627 × 10³ kg/m³. So approximately 5.56 × 10³ kg/m³. That's about 5560 kg/m³. Which is in line with Earth's actual average density (~5514 kg/m³). The slight discrepancy is due to rounding in the given values (e.g., G is given as 6.67×10^-11, and maybe the satellite period is approximate).\n\nSo Earth's density is approximately 5.56 × 10³ kg/m³ according to this calculation.\n\nNow, the problem says the newly discovered planet has a mass 25 times Earth's and volume 4.7 times Earth's. Therefore, its density is (mass / volume) = (25 M_earth) / (4.7 V_earth) = (25 / 4.7) * (M_earth / V_earth) = (25 / 4.7) * ρ_earth.\n\nSo let's compute that factor: 25 / 4.7 ≈ 5.3191.\n\nTherefore, ρ_planet ≈ 5.3191 * 5.56 × 10³ kg/m³.\n\nLet me compute 5.3191 * 5.56:\n\nFirst, approximate 5 * 5.56 = 27.8.\n\nThen 0.3191 * 5.56 ≈ Let's compute 0.3 * 5.56 = 1.668, and 0.0191 * 5.56 ≈ approx 0.106. Adding together ≈ 1.668 + 0.106 ≈ 1.774. Total ≈ 27.8 + 1.774 ≈ 29.574 × 10³ kg/m³? Wait, no. Wait, 5.3191 * 5.56 ≈ 29.574? Wait, that would be 29.574 × 10³ kg/m³? But looking at the options, the highest is 2.9 × 10^4 kg/m³ which is 29 × 10³. So this is about 29.5 × 10³, which would be 2.95 × 10^4 kg/m³. But option D is 2.9 × 10^4 kg/m³. So that seems like the answer is D?\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because this seems high. Let me verify:\n\nFirst, Earth's density via the calculation was approx 5.56 × 10³ kg/m³.\n\nPlanet's density is 25 / 4.7 times that.\n\n25 divided by 4.7 is approximately 5.319.\n\nMultiply 5.56 × 5.319:\n\nLet me compute 5.56 × 5 = 27.8\n\n5.56 × 0.319 ≈ Let's compute 5.56 × 0.3 = 1.668, 5.56 × 0.019 ≈ 0.1056. Total ≈ 1.668 + 0.1056 ≈ 1.7736. So total is 27.8 + 1.7736 ≈ 29.5736 × 10³ kg/m³, which is 2.957 × 10^4 kg/m³. So approximately 2.96 × 10^4 kg/m³. Which is very close to option D, which is 2.9 × 10^4 kg/m³. Considering possible rounding errors in the calculation steps, this would make D the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nFirst, the formula for density: ρ = 3π/(G T²). Is that correct?\n\nLet me rederive it quickly. Starting from T² = (4π²/GM) r³. For a near-Earth satellite, r ≈ R_earth. Also, M_earth = ρ * V = ρ*(4/3 π R³). Therefore:\n\nT² = [4π² / (G * ρ * (4/3 π R³))] * R³ = [4π² / (G ρ 4/3 π)] * R³ / R³ = [ (4π² * 3) / (4π G ρ) ) ] = 3π / (G ρ). Therefore, T² = 3π/(G ρ). Therefore, solving for ρ: ρ = 3π/(G T²). Yes, that's correct. So the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation of Earth's density as ~5.56 × 10³ kg/m³ is correct given the numbers.\n\nThen the planet's density is 25/4.7 times that, which is approx 5.319 * 5.56 × 10³ ≈ 29.57 × 10³ kg/m³ ≈ 2.96 × 10^4 kg/m³. So option D is 2.9 × 10^4, which is very close. So answer D.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach where maybe I don't need to calculate Earth's density first. Maybe using ratios?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I consider the same formula for the planet. If we had a near-planet satellite with orbital period T', then ρ_planet = 3π/(G T'²). But we don't have T' for the planet. However, maybe we can relate the periods based on the mass and volume? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the mass ratio and volume ratio, and we can find Earth's density, then find the planet's density. Which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the formula for density in terms of the satellite's period, but since we don't have the satellite's period for the new planet, but we have Earth's satellite period. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to relate the densities of the two planets using their mass and volume ratios and the satellite period?\n\nBut since the problem gives us Earth's satellite period, and we can use that to find Earth's density, then use the mass and volume ratios to get the planet's density. Which is exactly what I did.\n\nTherefore, unless I made an arithmetic mistake, the answer should be D. But let me check if there's an error in unit conversions or calculations.\n\nFirst, converting 1.4 hours to seconds: 1.4 * 3600 = 5040 seconds. Correct.\n\nCalculating T²: 5040² = 25,401,600. Correct.\n\nCalculating G*T²: 6.67e-11 * 2.54016e7 = approx 1.694e-3 m³/kg. Correct.\n\nThen 3π / that value is approx 9.4248 / 0.001694 ≈ 5563 kg/m³. Correct.\n\nThen multiplying by 25/4.7 ≈ 5.319 gives approx 5563 * 5.319. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLet me take 5563 * 5 = 27,815\n\n5563 * 0.319:\n\nFirst compute 5563 * 0.3 = 1,668.9\n\n5563 * 0.019 = 5563 * 0.01 + 5563 * 0.009 = 55.63 + 50.067 ≈ 105.697\n\nTotal for 0.319 is approx 1,668.9 + 105.697 ≈ 1,774.597\n\nSo total density is approx 27,815 + 1,774.597 ≈ 29,589.597 kg/m³ ≈ 2.959 × 10^4 kg/m³. Which is indeed approximately 2.96 × 10^4 kg/m³. The given option D is 2.9 × 10^4 kg/m³. Considering that the given values in the problem are approximate (the satellite period is \"about 1.4 hours\", and the gravitational constant is given with three significant figures), the answer is likely rounded to two significant figures, making 2.9 × 10^4 kg/m³ the correct choice. Therefore, option D.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach where maybe I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem says \"a certain near-Earth satellite orbiting the Earth is about 1.4 hours\". But isn't the actual orbital period of a low Earth orbit satellite about 90 minutes? Wait, 1.4 hours is 84 minutes? Wait, no, 1.4 hours is 84 minutes? No, 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.4 hours is 60 + 0.4*60 = 60 + 24 = 84 minutes. Wait, but typical low Earth orbit satellites have periods around 90 minutes. For example, the International Space Station orbits about every 90-93 minutes. So 84 minutes is a bit shorter, but possible for a very low orbit. However, the given value here is 1.4 hours, so we have to go with that.\n\nBut if the actual value is different, but in the problem they give us 1.4 hours, so our calculation is based on that. Therefore, even though it's a bit shorter than typical, we proceed with the given data.\n\nTherefore, unless there is a miscalculation, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) 1.8 × 10³ kg/m³\n\n(B) 5.6 × 10³ kg/m³\n\n(C) 1.1 × 10⁴ kg/m³\n\n(D) 2.9 × 10⁴ kg/m³\n\nSo my calculation gives approx 2.96 × 10⁴, so D is correct.\n\nBut let me check if I messed up the ratio of mass and volume. The problem says the volume is 4.7 times Earth's, mass is 25 times. Therefore density is (25 / 4.7) * Earth's density. Yes. Because density is mass/volume. So if mass scales by 25 and volume by 4.7, then density scales by 25/4.7. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the density is (mass ratio) / (volume ratio), but since density is mass/volume, yes, exactly. So 25/4.7 times Earth's density. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way that someone might approach this problem and get a different answer, perhaps by miscalculating the Earth's density.\n\nFor example, if someone forgot to convert hours to seconds, they would get a wrong T. Let's see:\n\nIf someone used T = 1.4 hours without converting to seconds, they would have T in hours. But in the formula, T must be in seconds because G is in SI units. If someone mistakenly used T in hours, they would get a wrong value. For example, T = 1.4 hours = 1.4 * 3600 seconds, but if they used T = 1.4 seconds, then T² would be way too small, leading to a huge density. But since the problem says \"a near-Earth satellite orbiting the Earth is about 1.4 hours\", they have to convert to seconds. So as long as that step is done correctly, the calculation is okay.\n\nAlternatively, if someone messed up the formula for density, like using T² = (4π²/GM) r³ but not realizing that for near-Earth satellite r ≈ R, and not substituting M = ρ*(4/3 π R³), then they might have gone down a wrong path. But the derivation seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that density is mass divided by volume, so directly compute 25 M_earth / 4.7 V_earth, but without knowing Earth's density? But without knowing Earth's density, how would they compute the numerical value? They need Earth's density, which requires the given satellite period and G. Hence, the approach I took is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
