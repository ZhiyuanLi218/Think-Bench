Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that when you multiply terms with exponents, you add the exponents if the bases are the same. And when you divide, you subtract the exponents. Also, there are coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables) that I need to multiply and then divide. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with the numerator: (10r³)(4r⁶). Let me handle the coefficients first. 10 multiplied by 4. Hmm, 10 times 4 is 40. Okay, so the coefficient part of the numerator is 40. Now for the variables. Both terms have the base r, so I can add the exponents. The first term is r³ and the second is r⁶. Adding 3 and 6 gives me 9, so the variable part is r⁹. Therefore, the numerator simplifies to 40r⁹.\n\nNow the entire expression is 40r⁹ divided by 8r⁴. Let me write that as a fraction: 40r⁹ / 8r⁴. Now, simplifying this fraction. Again, coefficients first. 40 divided by 8. Let me do that division. 40 divided by 8 is 5. So the coefficient part is 5.\n\nNow the variables: r⁹ divided by r⁴. Since the base is the same, I subtract the exponents. 9 minus 4 is 5. So that would be r⁵. Putting it all together, the simplified expression is 5r⁵.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with multiplying the two terms in the numerator: 10 times 4 is indeed 40, and r³ times r⁶ is r^(3+6)=r⁹. Then dividing by 8r⁴: 40 divided by 8 is 5, and r⁹ divided by r⁴ is r^(9-4)=r⁵. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by simplifying before multiplying? Let me try that. The original expression is (10r³)(4r⁶)/(8r⁴). Maybe I can rearrange the terms to group coefficients and like variables together. So that would be (10 * 4 / 8) * (r³ * r⁶ / r⁴). Let's compute the coefficients first: 10*4 is 40, then divided by 8 is 5. Same as before. For the variables: r³ * r⁶ is r⁹, divided by r⁴ is r⁵. Yep, same result. So that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe simplify the coefficients first before dealing with the variables. Let's see. The original expression: 10/8 * 4 * r³ * r⁶ / r⁴. Wait, 10/8 can be simplified. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 10/8 = 5/4. Then multiplying by 4: 5/4 * 4 = 5. Then again, variables: r³ * r⁶ / r⁴ = r^(3+6-4) = r^5. So again, 5r⁵. Same answer. Okay, so regardless of the method, I get 5r⁵. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nLet me think if there's any chance I messed up the exponents. For example, when multiplying r³ and r⁶, adding exponents: 3 + 6 = 9. Then dividing by r⁴, subtract 4, so 9 - 4 = 5. So r⁵. That seems right. If I had done something like multiplying exponents instead of adding, that would be wrong. For example, if someone thought r³ * r⁶ was r^(3*6) which is r^18, but that's incorrect. But I remember the rule is add when multiplying, subtract when dividing. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: coefficients. 10*4=40. 40 divided by 8 is indeed 5. If I had messed up the multiplication or division, maybe if I thought 10*4 was 44 or something, but no, 10*4 is straightforward. Divided by 8: 40 divided by 8 is 5. Correct.\n\nIs there any other aspect to consider? Maybe negative exponents? But since all exponents are positive here, and after simplifying, the exponent is still positive. If the exponent had come out negative, I might need to write it as a denominator or something, but in this case, it's positive 5. So 5r⁵ is a simplified monomial with positive exponents. That should be the final answer.\n\nWait, let me plug in a number for r to test. Let me choose r = 2. Let me compute the original expression and my simplified expression to see if they match.\n\nOriginal expression: (10*(2)^3)*(4*(2)^6) / (8*(2)^4)\n\nFirst compute each part:\n\n10*(2)^3 = 10*8 = 80\n\n4*(2)^6 = 4*64 = 256\n\nMultiply those: 80*256. Let me compute that. 80*200=16,000; 80*56=4,480. Total is 16,000 + 4,480 = 20,480.\n\nDenominator: 8*(2)^4 = 8*16 = 128.\n\nSo overall value is 20,480 / 128. Let me divide that. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 16: 20,480 ÷16= 1,280; 128 ÷16=8. Now 1,280 /8= 160.\n\nNow my simplified expression: 5*(2)^5. 2^5 is 32. 5*32=160. Same result! So that checks out. Let me try another value, maybe r=1.\n\nOriginal expression: (10*1^3)(4*1^6)/ (8*1^4) = (10*1)(4*1)/8*1 = 10*4 /8 = 40/8=5.\n\nSimplified expression: 5*(1)^5=5*1=5. Same result. Good.\n\nAnother test with r=3.\n\nOriginal expression: (10*(3)^3)*(4*(3)^6)/(8*(3)^4)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n10*(27) = 270\n\n4*(3^6). 3^6 is 729. 4*729=2,916\n\nMultiply 270*2,916. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute 270*2,916. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, note that 270 = 27 * 10.\n\nSo 27*2,916 *10. Let me compute 27*2,916. Let me compute 2,916 * 27:\n\nWell, 2,916 * 20 = 58,320\n\n2,916 *7 = 20,412\n\nAdding together: 58,320 + 20,412 = 78,732\n\nMultiply by 10: 787,320.\n\nDenominator: 8*(3^4) = 8*81=648.\n\nSo original expression value is 787,320 / 648. Let me divide that.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 12: 787,320 ÷12=65,610; 648 ÷12=54.\n\nNow divide 65,610 /54. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 6: 65,610 ÷6=10,935; 54 ÷6=9.\n\nSo now 10,935 /9. Let me compute that: 9*1,215=10,935. So the result is 1,215.\n\nNow simplified expression: 5*(3)^5. 3^5 is 243. 5*243=1,215. Same result. Perfect. So my simplified expression works with different values. Therefore, I can be confident that 5r⁵ is the correct simplification.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5r⁵.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified expression is \\boxed{5r^5}.\n</think>"}
