Let me start by visualizing the problem. There's a big cylinder (radius a) rolling on a horizontal plane without slipping, with its center A moving at constant velocity u. Then there's a smaller cylinder (radius b) rolling on top of the big cylinder without slipping, and its center B is moving at a constant speed v relative to the first cylinder's coordinate system. The question is about the angular velocity of AB in the inertial frame.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when dealing with rolling without slipping, the instantaneous point of contact has zero velocity relative to the surface it's rolling on. For the first cylinder, since it's rolling on the horizontal plane without slipping, the velocity of its center A is u. The angular velocity of the first cylinder, let's call it ω₁, should be related to u and its radius a. Since it's rolling without slipping, the tangential velocity at the point of contact should equal the velocity due to rotation. The center is moving at u, so the angular velocity should be ω₁ = u / a. Wait, but direction? If it's rolling to the right, then the angular velocity would be clockwise, right? So maybe ω₁ = -u/a if we take clockwise as negative? Hmm, but maybe I need to be careful with coordinate systems here.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to worry about the direction of ω₁ for now. Let me think about the second cylinder. The center B is moving with velocity v relative to the first cylinder. Since the first cylinder is itself rotating, the velocity of B in the inertial frame will be a combination of the velocity of the first cylinder's center A plus the velocity due to the rotation of the first cylinder plus the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder.\n\nBut wait, the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first cylinder. So the point of contact between the two cylinders must have equal velocities. Let me try to model that.\n\nLet me denote the angular velocity of the second cylinder relative to the first cylinder as ω₂. Since it's rolling without slipping on the first cylinder, the tangential velocity at the point of contact between the two cylinders should be equal. The velocity of the point on the first cylinder at the contact point (relative to inertial frame) is the velocity of A plus the velocity due to the rotation of the first cylinder. The velocity of the point on the second cylinder at the contact point (relative to inertial frame) is the velocity of B plus the velocity due to the rotation of the second cylinder.\n\nBut since they are rolling without slipping relative to each other, these two velocities must be equal. Let me formalize that.\n\nLet me first figure out the angular velocity of the second cylinder relative to the first. Let me assume that the second cylinder is rolling on the first one. Let me think about the relative motion. If the center B is moving with velocity v relative to the first cylinder, then the angular velocity ω₂ (relative to the first cylinder) would be such that the no-slip condition is satisfied. The distance between the centers A and B is a + b, since they are both cylinders with radii a and b. So if the center B is moving with velocity v relative to the first cylinder along the surface of the first cylinder, then the angular velocity of the second cylinder relative to the first cylinder is ω₂ = v / (a + b). Wait, but direction? If the second cylinder is rolling on the first, depending on the direction of motion, the angular velocity could be clockwise or counterclockwise. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the first cylinder is rolling to the right. Let's say the second cylinder is rolling on top of it. If the center B is moving with velocity v relative to the first cylinder, say in the direction tangential to the first cylinder. If the first cylinder is rotating clockwise (since it's rolling to the right), then if the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first, depending on the direction of B's motion relative to the first cylinder, the angular velocity would be different. Let me try to imagine.\n\nIf the second cylinder is rolling on the first cylinder without slipping, then the point of contact must have zero relative velocity. Suppose that from the perspective of the first cylinder, the center B is moving with velocity v along the surface of the first cylinder. Let me assume that this velocity is tangential. Let me consider the relative angular velocity.\n\nThe relative angular velocity ω₂' (relative to the first cylinder) would need to satisfy that the tangential velocity at the point of contact is equal to the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder. The distance between the centers is a + b, so if the center B is moving with velocity v relative to the first cylinder, then the angular velocity of the second cylinder relative to the first is ω₂' = v / (a + b). But also, since the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first, the tangential velocity due to its rotation must match the velocity of the point on the first cylinder. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of relative velocities.\n\nAlternatively, the velocity of the point of contact on the second cylinder relative to the first cylinder is equal to the velocity of the point of contact on the first cylinder relative to the first cylinder, which is zero? No, wait. The point of contact on the first cylinder is moving with velocity due to the rotation of the first cylinder. But in the frame of the first cylinder, that point is rotating. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to write equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me first figure out the angular velocity of the first cylinder. Since it's rolling on the horizontal plane without slipping, its angular velocity ω₁ is equal to u / a. Let me take ω₁ as clockwise if the center is moving to the right, so in standard coordinates, if positive x is to the right and positive y is up, then the angular velocity vector would be in the negative z direction. But maybe I need to think in terms of magnitudes for now.\n\nNow, the second cylinder is rolling on the first. Let me consider the motion of the center B. In the inertial frame, the velocity of B is equal to the velocity of A plus the velocity of B relative to A. The velocity of B relative to A is due to both the rotation of the second cylinder around the first and its own rotation. But since it's rolling without slipping, these two are related.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the concept of instantaneous centers of rotation or something. Alternatively, think about the velocity of B in the inertial frame.\n\nLet me consider the motion of the second cylinder. Let me assume that the line AB makes some angle θ with the vertical or horizontal? Wait, the problem says that point B is moving at a constant rate v relative to the coordinate system fixed to the first cylinder. So in the frame of the first cylinder, which is rotating with angular velocity ω₁, the center B is moving with velocity v. But since the first cylinder is itself rotating, we need to be careful about how this translates to the inertial frame.\n\nBut the question is about the angular velocity of AB relative to the inertial frame. So maybe I need to find how fast the line AB is rotating in the inertial frame.\n\nLet me think of AB as a line connecting the centers of the two cylinders. Since the first cylinder is rolling on the plane, and the second is rolling on the first, the position of B relative to A is changing both because of the rotation of the first cylinder and the rotation of the second cylinder relative to the first.\n\nBut since the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder is constant, that suggests that in the frame of the first cylinder, B is moving with constant speed v along the surface of the first cylinder. Therefore, if we imagine the first cylinder as fixed (even though in reality it's rotating), the center B would be moving along a circular path around A with angular velocity ω₂' = v / (a + b). But since the first cylinder is itself rotating with angular velocity ω₁, the total angular velocity of AB in the inertial frame would be the sum of ω₁ and ω₂'? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, in the frame of the first cylinder, which is non-inertial because it's rotating, the center B is moving with angular velocity ω₂' = v / (a + b). Therefore, in the inertial frame, the angular velocity of AB would be the angular velocity of the first cylinder's frame plus the angular velocity of B relative to the first cylinder's frame. But angular velocities add vectorially. If the first cylinder is rotating with angular velocity ω₁ and the second cylinder is rotating around the first with angular velocity ω₂', then the total angular velocity of AB would be ω_total = ω₁ + ω₂'.\n\nBut need to check directions. Suppose the first cylinder is rotating clockwise with angular velocity ω₁ = u/a. In the frame of the first cylinder, if the center B is moving with angular velocity ω₂' around A, depending on the direction of v. If v is in the direction of rotation, or opposite?\n\nWait, the problem says \"point B moving at a constant rate v relative to a coordinate system fixed to the first cylinder\". So if the first cylinder is rotating clockwise, then a coordinate system fixed to it is also rotating clockwise. If the center B is moving with velocity v relative to that rotating frame, then the direction of v is important.\n\nBut since the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first, the direction of ω₂' is determined by the direction of v. Let me think. If the center B is moving in the direction such that the second cylinder rolls without slipping. For example, if the first cylinder is rolling to the right, then at the point where the second cylinder is sitting on top, the surface of the first cylinder is moving to the right (due to rotation). If the second cylinder is to roll without slipping on the first, then depending on the direction it moves relative to the first cylinder, it will have different rotation.\n\nSuppose in the frame of the first cylinder, the center B is moving clockwise around A. Then the second cylinder would be rotating such that its bottom point (in contact with the first cylinder) has a velocity opposite to its center's motion. Wait, if the center is moving clockwise around A, then to have no slipping, the rotation of the second cylinder must be such that the tangential velocity at the contact point cancels the relative motion.\n\nLet me formalize this. In the frame of the first cylinder, the velocity of B is tangential to the circle of radius (a + b) with angular velocity ω₂'. The velocity of B is v = ω₂' * (a + b). Therefore, ω₂' = v / (a + b). But also, since the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first, the angular velocity of the second cylinder relative to the first must satisfy that the tangential velocity at the contact point is equal to the velocity of the surface of the first cylinder at that point.\n\nWait, but in the frame of the first cylinder, the surface at the contact point is rotating. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to use the no-slip condition between the two cylinders.\n\nLet me consider the instantaneous velocities at the point of contact. Let me denote the point of contact between the two cylinders as P. In the inertial frame, the velocity of P on the first cylinder must equal the velocity of P on the second cylinder.\n\nThe velocity of P on the first cylinder is the velocity of A plus the velocity due to rotation of the first cylinder. Since A is moving at velocity u, and the angular velocity of the first cylinder is ω₁ = u/a, then the velocity of P relative to A is ω₁ × (vector from A to P). Depending on where P is located, but since P is the point of contact between the two cylinders, the vector from A to P has magnitude a, and direction towards B? Wait, no. The center of the second cylinder is at distance a + b from A, so the point P is located at distance a from A towards B, and also distance b from B towards A.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of P on the first cylinder is velocity of A plus ω₁ × (vector AP). Let me assume that the line AB is making some angle θ with the horizontal. But since we are dealing with general motion, maybe we can think in terms of relative angular velocities.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in the inertial frame. The velocity of P on the first cylinder is u (velocity of A) plus the velocity due to rotation. Since the first cylinder is rolling without slipping on the plane, the velocity at the top of the cylinder (if θ = 0) would be 2u, but here P is somewhere else.\n\nBut maybe I need to relate the angular velocities. Let me denote the angular velocity of the second cylinder in the inertial frame as ω₂. Then the velocity of P on the second cylinder is velocity of B plus ω₂ × (vector BP). Since BP is a radius of the second cylinder, pointing towards P, which is in the direction opposite to AP.\n\nTherefore, equating the two velocities at P:\n\nu + ω₁ × AP = v_B + ω₂ × BP.\n\nBut I need to figure out v_B, the velocity of B in the inertial frame. Also, note that AP is a vector from A to P, which is in the direction from A to B, with magnitude a. Similarly, BP is from B to P, magnitude b, opposite direction.\n\nBut how is v_B related to other variables? In the problem statement, it says that point B is moving at a constant rate v relative to the coordinate system fixed to the first cylinder. So in the frame of the first cylinder, which is rotating with angular velocity ω₁, the velocity of B is v. Therefore, in the inertial frame, the velocity of B is the velocity due to the rotation of the first cylinder's frame plus the velocity in the rotating frame. That is:\n\nv_B = v_A + ω₁ × (vector AB) + v_relative,\n\nwhere v_relative is the velocity of B relative to the rotating frame, which is given as v. But since v_A is u in the horizontal direction, and the vector AB is from A to B, which has magnitude (a + b), and direction depending on the rotation.\n\nBut since the problem states that the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder is constant, that implies that in the rotating frame of the first cylinder, B is moving with constant speed v along the surface. Therefore, in that frame, B is undergoing circular motion with angular speed ω₂' = v / (a + b). Therefore, in the inertial frame, the angular velocity of AB would be the sum of the angular velocity of the first cylinder's frame (ω₁) and the angular velocity of B relative to that frame (ω₂'). However, angular velocities add vectorially. If ω₁ and ω₂' are in the same direction, then they add; if opposite, they subtract.\n\nAssuming that both rotations are about axes perpendicular to the plane (since the cylinders are rolling on a horizontal plane, the axes are vertical, so angular velocities are along the z-axis). Let me assume that the first cylinder is rotating clockwise (so ω₁ is negative if we take counterclockwise as positive). If in the frame of the first cylinder, B is moving with angular velocity ω₂' around A. The direction of ω₂' depends on the direction of v. Since the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first, the direction of ω₂' must be such that it satisfies the no-slip condition.\n\nLet me think again about the no-slip condition between the two cylinders. In the inertial frame, the velocity of the contact point P on the first cylinder is u + ω₁ × AP. The velocity of P on the second cylinder is v_B + ω₂ × BP. These must be equal.\n\nBut also, in the rotating frame of the first cylinder, the velocity of B is v tangential to the circle of radius (a + b). Therefore, in the inertial frame, the velocity of B is v_A + ω₁ × AB + v. Wait, no. The velocity in the inertial frame is equal to the velocity in the rotating frame plus the velocity due to rotation of the frame. But since B is moving in the rotating frame, the total velocity is:\n\nv_B = v_A + [velocity due to rotation of frame] + [velocity of B in rotating frame].\n\nBut the velocity due to rotation of the frame at point B is ω₁ × AB. Wait, actually, the standard formula is that the velocity in the inertial frame is equal to the velocity in the rotating frame plus ω × r, where r is the position vector from the origin of the rotating frame. But here, if we consider the rotating frame fixed to the first cylinder, which is translating with velocity u and rotating with angular velocity ω₁. However, since the center A is moving at constant velocity u, the rotating frame is both translating and rotating. However, when dealing with velocities, the velocity in the inertial frame is:\n\nv_B = v_A + ω₁ × (AB) + v_relative,\n\nwhere v_relative is the velocity of B relative to the rotating frame. Since the problem states that v_relative has magnitude v and is tangential to the circle of radius (a + b) around A. Therefore, in the rotating frame, B is moving with angular velocity ω₂' = v / (a + b). Therefore, the direction of ω₂' depends on the direction of v.\n\nBut since the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first, we can relate ω₂' and ω₂ (the angular velocity of the second cylinder in the inertial frame). Let me consider the no-slip condition again. The velocity of P on the first cylinder is u + ω₁ × AP. The velocity of P on the second cylinder is v_B + ω₂ × BP. Setting them equal:\n\nu + ω₁ × AP = v_B + ω₂ × BP.\n\nBut AP is a vector from A to P, which is in the direction of AB with magnitude a. Similarly, BP is from B to P, magnitude b, opposite direction to AB. Let me denote AB as a vector of length (a + b). Let me assume that AB is a vector in some direction, say making an angle θ with the horizontal. However, since the problem says that the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder is constant, that suggests that the angular velocity ω₂' is constant, so the angle θ is changing at a constant rate, which would be ω_total, the angular velocity of AB we need to find.\n\nBut maybe I can express the cross products. Let me consider the direction. Let me assume that all motion is in the plane, so angular velocities are along the z-axis. Let me take counterclockwise as positive. Then:\n\nThe first cylinder is rolling without slipping on the plane with velocity u to the right. Therefore, its angular velocity ω₁ is clockwise, which would be negative: ω₁ = -u/a.\n\nIn the rotating frame of the first cylinder, the center B is moving with angular velocity ω₂' (which could be positive or negative). Since the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first, we need to determine ω₂'.\n\nLet me think about the direction. Suppose that in the rotating frame of the first cylinder, the center B is moving clockwise around A. Then ω₂' would be negative. Alternatively, if moving counterclockwise, positive. Depending on the direction, the rotation of the second cylinder will adjust to satisfy the no-slip condition.\n\nLet me consider that in the rotating frame of the first cylinder, the velocity of B is tangential, so if it's moving clockwise, then the velocity vector is clockwise around A. Then, for the second cylinder to roll without slipping on the first, the angular velocity ω₂ of the second cylinder must be such that the tangential velocity at P due to its rotation cancels the relative motion.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the equation from before:\n\nu + ω₁ × AP = v_B + ω₂ × BP.\n\nLet me express all terms. Let me take AB as a vector of magnitude (a + b). Let me consider the direction of AB. Let me suppose that AB is a radial vector from A to B. Then AP is a vector from A to P, which is along AB with magnitude a. Similarly, BP is from B to P, opposite direction, magnitude b.\n\nLet me express the cross products. Since everything is in the plane, cross products will be scalars with direction along z-axis. Let me take the z-axis as perpendicular to the plane, with positive direction upwards.\n\nAssume that ω₁ is clockwise, so negative: ω₁ = -u/a.\n\nThe term ω₁ × AP: since AP is a radial vector from A to P, which is along AB. The cross product ω₁ × AP would be ω₁ * |AP| in the tangential direction. But since ω₁ is clockwise, and AP is radial, the cross product would be tangential clockwise, which is negative. The magnitude is |ω₁| * a.\n\nSimilarly, for the term ω₂ × BP: BP is from B to P, which is opposite to AB. The cross product ω₂ × BP would depend on the direction of ω₂. If ω₂ is clockwise, then it would be negative; if counterclockwise, positive.\n\nBut let me write the equation in terms of magnitudes, considering directions.\n\nLet me denote the direction of the velocities. Let me assume that in the inertial frame, the velocity of P on the first cylinder is u (to the right) plus the velocity due to rotation. Since the first cylinder is rotating clockwise, the tangential velocity at point P (which is on top of the first cylinder if AB is vertical) would be to the right. Wait, but P is the contact point between the two cylinders. Depending on where B is, P could be anywhere on the first cylinder.\n\nBut perhaps instead of getting bogged down, let me think in terms of relative angular velocities. In the frame of the first cylinder, the velocity of B is v tangential, so angular velocity ω₂' = v / (a + b). Therefore, in the inertial frame, the angular velocity of AB is ω_total = ω₁ + ω₂', considering that the rotation of the first cylinder and the rotation of B around A add up.\n\nBut need to check the direction. Suppose ω₁ is clockwise (negative) and ω₂' is also clockwise (negative), then ω_total would be more negative. If ω₂' is counterclockwise (positive), then they would subtract.\n\nBut how do we know the direction of ω₂'? Since the second cylinder is rolling without slipping on the first. Let me think about the direction of motion. If the first cylinder is rotating clockwise, then in the frame of the first cylinder, if the second cylinder is rolling without slipping, the direction of its rotation depends on the direction of motion of B.\n\nSuppose that in the frame of the first cylinder, B is moving clockwise around A. That would mean that the point P on the first cylinder is moving clockwise, so to have no slipping, the second cylinder must rotate such that its tangential velocity at P matches. Let me think. If B is moving clockwise around A, then relative to the first cylinder, the velocity of B is clockwise. The point P on the second cylinder must have zero velocity relative to the first cylinder's surface at P. Therefore, the second cylinder must rotate in such a way that the tangential velocity at P due to its own rotation is opposite to the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder.\n\nWait, if B is moving clockwise around A in the frame of the first cylinder, then the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder is tangential clockwise. For the no-slip condition, the velocity of the contact point P on the second cylinder relative to the first cylinder must be zero. Therefore, the velocity of P on the second cylinder relative to B must be equal and opposite to the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder.\n\nThe velocity of P on the second cylinder relative to B is ω₂ × BP. So:\n\nω₂ × BP = -v_relative.\n\nSince v_relative is the velocity of B relative to the first cylinder, which is tangential clockwise with magnitude v. Therefore, ω₂ × BP must be tangential counterclockwise with magnitude v. Since BP is a vector from B to P, which is opposite to AB. Let me consider magnitudes:\n\n|ω₂| * b = v => ω₂ = v / b.\n\nBut direction? If the required velocity is counterclockwise, then ω₂ is counterclockwise, which is positive. However, in the frame of the first cylinder, the required direction is counterclockwise? Wait, if the velocity of B is clockwise relative to the first cylinder, then to cancel that, the rotation of the second cylinder must be such that the velocity at P is counterclockwise relative to B. Therefore, if BP is pointing towards A, then a counterclockwise rotation of the second cylinder would make P move towards the direction opposite to B's motion. Let me confirm:\n\nImagine the second cylinder on top of the first. If B is moving clockwise around A (in the frame of the first cylinder), then to prevent slipping, the second cylinder must rotate counterclockwise so that the bottom point P doesn't slip. Yes, because if B moves clockwise, the bottom of the second cylinder needs to move counterclockwise relative to B to stay in place. Therefore, ω₂ is counterclockwise, positive, with magnitude v / b.\n\nBut earlier, we had from the motion of B in the rotating frame that the angular velocity of B around A is ω₂' = v / (a + b). Since B is moving clockwise around A in the rotating frame, ω₂' is negative: ω₂' = -v / (a + b). However, the angular velocity of the second cylinder itself is ω₂ = +v / b.\n\nBut how does this relate to the angular velocity of AB in the inertial frame?\n\nThe line AB is rotating due to two things: the rotation of the first cylinder (which has angular velocity ω₁ = -u/a) and the motion of B around A in the frame of the first cylinder (which has angular velocity ω₂' = -v/(a + b)). Therefore, the total angular velocity of AB in the inertial frame is the sum of these two angular velocities:\n\nω_total = ω₁ + ω₂' = (-u/a) + (-v/(a + b)) = - [u/a + v/(a + b)].\n\nBut wait, if both are clockwise, then adding them gives the total angular velocity. However, I need to check if the direction of ω₂' is indeed negative. Since in the rotating frame, B is moving clockwise around A, which would correspond to negative angular velocity. Therefore, yes, ω_total is the sum of ω₁ and ω₂'.\n\nBut let me verify with another approach. Let me compute the angular velocity of AB by considering the velocity of B in the inertial frame.\n\nThe velocity of B in the inertial frame is:\n\nv_B = velocity of A + velocity due to rotation of first cylinder + velocity of B relative to first cylinder.\n\nVelocity of A is u to the right.\n\nVelocity due to rotation of first cylinder at point B: since in the frame of the first cylinder, B is at a distance (a + b) from A, so the velocity due to rotation is ω₁ × (a + b). But direction? Since ω₁ is clockwise, this velocity is tangential clockwise. However, since B is not fixed on the first cylinder, but moving relative to it, this term is actually the velocity that B would have if it were fixed on the first cylinder. But since it's moving relative to it, we have to add the relative velocity.\n\nThe velocity of B relative to the first cylinder is v tangential. So combining these, the total velocity of B is:\n\nv_B = u (to the right) + ω₁ × (a + b) (tangential clockwise) + v (tangential).\n\nBut since both ω₁ × (a + b) and v are tangential, but in which direction? If the angular velocity ω₂' of B around A in the rotating frame is clockwise (negative), then the total tangential velocity is ω₁*(a + b) + v. However, since ω₁ is negative, this could be a combination.\n\nBut how does this relate to the angular velocity of AB?\n\nThe angular velocity of AB can be found by taking the cross product of the velocity of B minus velocity of A, divided by the distance AB.\n\nSince velocity of A is u, velocity of B is v_B, then the relative velocity of B with respect to A is v_B - u. The angular velocity ω_AB is (v_B - u) cross product divided by |AB|. Since everything is in the plane, it's just the magnitude divided by |AB|.\n\nSo let me compute v_B - u. The velocity of A is u, so subtracting u from v_B gives the velocity of B relative to A in the inertial frame. But earlier, we had that in the inertial frame, v_B = u + ω₁ × (a + b) + v. Therefore, v_B - u = ω₁ × (a + b) + v. The direction of this vector is tangential to the circle of radius (a + b) around A. Therefore, the magnitude is |ω₁*(a + b) + v|, and since it's tangential, the angular velocity ω_AB is this magnitude divided by (a + b):\n\nω_AB = [ |ω₁*(a + b) + v| ] / (a + b) = |ω₁ + v/(a + b)|.\n\nBut considering directions, if ω₁ is negative and v/(a + b) is negative (if v is in the same direction as ω₁*(a + b)), then ω_AB is just ω₁ + v/(a + b). However, we need to figure out the sign of v/(a + b). Earlier, we saw that in the rotating frame, the angular velocity ω₂' is -v/(a + b), but here we have +v/(a + b). Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the inertial frame, the relative velocity of B with respect to A is ω₁*(a + b) + v. However, the direction of v depends on the direction of motion. If in the rotating frame, B is moving clockwise with angular velocity ω₂' = -v/(a + b), then in the inertial frame, the tangential velocity due to that motion is v = ω₂'*(a + b) = -v/(a + b)*(a + b) = -v. Wait, no:\n\nWait, if in the rotating frame, the angular velocity is ω₂' = -v/(a + b), then the tangential velocity is ω₂'*(a + b) = -v. Therefore, in the inertial frame, the relative velocity of B with respect to A is ω₁*(a + b) + (-v). Therefore:\n\nv_B - u = ω₁*(a + b) - v.\n\nTherefore, angular velocity ω_AB is [ω₁*(a + b) - v]/(a + b) = ω₁ - v/(a + b).\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was ω₁ + ω₂', where ω₂' was -v/(a + b). Which would give ω₁ + (-v/(a + b)) = same as above. So that matches. Therefore, ω_AB = ω₁ - v/(a + b).\n\nBut ω₁ is -u/a, so:\n\nω_AB = -u/a - v/(a + b).\n\nBut angular velocity can be negative, depending on direction. The question asks for the angular velocity of AB relative to the inertial frame. Depending on the directions of u and v, it could be clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nBut let me check again with the previous approach where I considered the no-slip condition. Earlier, I found that ω₂ = +v/b (counterclockwise). Is there a relation between ω_AB and ω₂?\n\nWell, ω_AB is the angular velocity of B around A, which is related to ω₂'. But we also have that from the no-slip condition, we found ω₂ = v/b. Is there a way to relate this to the previous result?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to make sure that all conditions are satisfied. Let me check with numbers. Suppose u = 0, so the first cylinder is not moving, just rotating in place with ω₁ = 0? No, if u = 0, then since it's rolling without slipping, ω₁ would also be zero. Wait, rolling without slipping on a horizontal plane requires that v = ω*r. If the center is not moving, then it's just spinning in place, but that's not rolling without slipping on a plane. So maybe u cannot be zero. Anyway, let's take some example.\n\nLet me take u positive to the right, so ω₁ = -u/a (clockwise). Let me assume that v is such that in the rotating frame, B is moving clockwise around A, so ω₂' = -v/(a + b). Then in the inertial frame, ω_AB = ω₁ + ω₂' = -u/a - v/(a + b). Which is what I had before.\n\nBut let me also check with the velocity of point P. Earlier, I had the equation:\n\nu + ω₁ × AP = v_B + ω₂ × BP.\n\nLet me plug in the values. Let me take magnitudes, assuming everything is in the same direction for simplicity. Let me suppose that AB is horizontal for a moment, with B to the right of A. Then AP is a vector from A to P (which is a distance a to the right), and BP is from B to P (a distance b to the left). The velocity of P on the first cylinder is u (to the right) plus ω₁ × AP. Since ω₁ is clockwise, the tangential velocity at P (which is on the right side of the first cylinder) is downward? Wait, no. Wait, if the cylinder is rolling to the right without slipping, then at the point P which is on the right side (the top?), no, if AB is horizontal with B to the right, then P is the point of contact between the two cylinders, which would be on the right side of the first cylinder. The velocity of P on the first cylinder is u (velocity of center) plus the velocity due to rotation. Since the first cylinder is rolling to the right, the velocity at the top of the cylinder is u + ω₁*a. But ω₁ = u/a, so total velocity is u + (u/a)*a = 2u to the right. Wait, but if P is on the right side, then depending on where exactly. If the cylinder is rolling to the right, then the bottom point has zero velocity, the top has 2u. But if P is the point where the second cylinder is in contact, which is on the side, then its velocity would be different.\n\nWait, if AB is horizontal, then P is the point where the two cylinders touch, which is on the right side of the first cylinder. The velocity of P on the first cylinder is velocity of center A (u to the right) plus velocity due to rotation. The rotation is clockwise, so at point P (on the right), the tangential velocity is downward. Wait, yes. If the cylinder is rolling to the right, the bottom of the cylinder is moving to the left relative to the center, but since it's rolling without slipping, the bottom point is instantaneously at rest. Wait, no, if it's rolling to the right, the rotation is clockwise. So at the rightmost point (P), the tangential velocity is downward. Therefore, the total velocity of P is u (right) + downward component. However, the second cylinder is resting on top? No, if AB is horizontal with B to the right, then the second cylinder is sitting on the first cylinder's right side. But if the first cylinder is rolling on the plane, the second cylinder would be in contact on the side, not on top. However, for it to roll without slipping, the velocities must match.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too specific. Let me try plugging in the values. Let me assume AB is horizontal, B to the right. The velocity of P on the first cylinder is u (right) plus ω₁ × AP. Since AP is horizontal to the right, and ω₁ is clockwise, the cross product ω₁ × AP is downward. So the velocity of P has a horizontal component u and a vertical component -ω₁*a. \n\nThe velocity of P on the second cylinder is v_B + ω₂ × BP. BP is from B to P, which is to the left (since P is on the first cylinder, to the left of B). The velocity of B, v_B, we found earlier as u + ω₁*(a + b) - v. Wait, no. Earlier, we had v_B - u = ω₁*(a + b) - v, so v_B = u + ω₁*(a + b) - v. But need to figure out direction.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is horizontal, and in the inertial frame, AB is rotating with angular velocity ω_AB = -u/a - v/(a + b) (clockwise). Therefore, the velocity of B relative to A is ω_AB × AB. Since AB is horizontal to the right, and ω_AB is clockwise (negative), the velocity is downward. Therefore, v_B = velocity of A (u to the right) plus downward velocity. Therefore, the total velocity of B is to the right and down.\n\nThen, the velocity of P on the second cylinder is velocity of B plus ω₂ × BP. BP is from B to P, which is to the left (horizontal). If ω₂ is the angular velocity of the second cylinder, which we found earlier as +v/b (counterclockwise), then ω₂ × BP would be upward (since counterclockwise rotation on BP to the left gives upward velocity at P). \n\nSo let me write the components. Velocity of P on first cylinder: right u, down ω₁*a.\n\nVelocity of P on second cylinder: right (from v_B) plus upward (from ω₂ × BP).\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFirst, ω₁ = -u/a (clockwise).\n\nVelocity of P on first cylinder: horizontal component u, vertical component -ω₁*a = -(-u/a)*a = u. Wait, that would be upward? Wait, if ω₁ is clockwise, then the tangential velocity at P (on the right side) is downward. But according to calculation, -ω₁*a = -(-u/a)*a = u. Wait, positive upward? That seems contradictory. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, perhaps my sign convention for cross product. Let me clarify. If we take the angular velocity as a vector, clockwise is negative z-direction. The cross product ω × r for a point P. If ω is in -z, and r is in +x (AP is to the right), then ω × r is (-ω_z * \\hat{k}) × (r_x * \\hat{i}) = -ω_z * r_x * (\\hat{k} × \\hat{i}) = -ω_z * r_x * \\hat{j}. Which is downward, as expected. Therefore, the vertical component is -ω_z * r_x. Since ω_z is -u/a, then vertical component is -(-u/a)*a = u. Wait, upward? But we expected downward. Contradiction. What is happening?\n\nWait, no. Let me do it carefully. Let me define coordinates: x-axis to the right, y-axis up, z-axis out of the plane (right-hand rule). Angular velocity clockwise is negative z-direction. The position vector AP is along +x. The cross product ω × AP is (-ω_z \\hat{k}) × (AP_x \\hat{i}) = -ω_z * AP_x (\\hat{k} × \\hat{i}) = -ω_z * AP_x * \\hat{j}. So direction is -\\hat{j} if ω_z is positive? Wait, no:\n\nWait, \\hat{k} × \\hat{i} = \\hat{j}, by right-hand rule. Therefore, (-ω_z \\hat{k}) × (AP_x \\hat{i}) = -ω_z * AP_x * \\hat{j}. So if ω_z is negative (clockwise), then -ω_z is positive, so overall it's positive * \\hat{j}, which is upward. But we expected the tangential velocity at P (on the right side of the first cylinder) to be downward. Contradiction. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! The tangential velocity due to rotation is ω × r, but if the cylinder is rolling to the right, the tangential velocity at P should be downward. However, according to this calculation, it's upward. That suggests a problem with sign conventions.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the cylinder is rolling to the right without slipping, the rotation is clockwise. At the rightmost point, the tangential velocity due to rotation is to the left? No, tangential velocity direction depends on the rotation. If it's rotating clockwise, a point on the right side moves downward. Wait, yes. If you have a wheel rotating clockwise, the top point moves to the right, the bottom to the left, the rightmost point moves downward, the leftmost moves upward. Therefore, at point P on the right side, the tangential velocity is downward. But according to our cross product, we have upward. So there must be a sign error.\n\nAh! The cross product ω × r gives the velocity due to rotation. But if the angular velocity vector is clockwise (-z), then the velocity at P should be downward, which is -y direction. However, according to our previous calculation, it was +y. Therefore, there must be an error in the cross product.\n\nWait, let's recast. The velocity due to rotation is ω × r. If ω is clockwise, which is -z direction. The position vector r is from the center A to P, which is +x direction. Then ω × r = (-ω \\hat{k}) × (r \\hat{i}) = -ω r (\\hat{k} × \\hat{i}) = -ω r \\hat{j}. Which is downward (-y), since \\hat{k} × \\hat{i} = \\hat{j}, so negative of that is -\\hat{j}. Ah! There we go. I had a sign error earlier. So the velocity is -ω r \\hat{j}, which is downward if ω is positive? Wait, no:\n\nWait ω is the magnitude. If ω is the angular velocity vector, then ω = -ω_z \\hat{k} where ω_z is positive (magnitude). Then ω × r = (-ω_z \\hat{k}) × (r \\hat{i}) = -ω_z r (\\hat{k} × \\hat{i}) = -ω_z r \\hat{j}. So this is downward (-\\hat{j}) if ω_z is positive? No, \\hat{j} is up, so -\\hat{j} is down. Yes! Therefore, the velocity is downward, as expected. So my previous calculation was correct, but I had confused myself with the sign.\n\nSo going back, velocity of P on the first cylinder is u \\hat{i} + (-ω₁ a) \\hat{j}. Given that ω₁ = -u/a (since it's clockwise), then -ω₁ a = -(-u/a)*a = u. Therefore, velocity of P is u \\hat{i} + u \\hat{j}. Wait, upward? That can't be. If the cylinder is rolling to the right, the velocity at the rightmost point should be to the right and down, not up. What's wrong here?\n\nHold on, if ω₁ is clockwise, then ω is -|ω| \\hat{k}. The velocity at P is ω × AP + velocity of A. Velocity of A is u \\hat{i}. The velocity due to rotation is ω × AP = -|ω| a \\hat{j}. Therefore, total velocity is u \\hat{i} - |ω| a \\hat{j}. But since for rolling without slipping, |ω| = u/a, so this becomes u \\hat{i} - u \\hat{j}. Ah! There we go. Earlier, I had a sign error in substituting ω₁. Since ω₁ is -u/a, then -ω₁ a is -(-u/a)*a = u. But if the velocity due to rotation is -|ω| a \\hat{j}, then with |ω| = u/a, it is -u \\hat{j}. Therefore, total velocity is u \\hat{i} - u \\hat{j}. So right and down, as expected. Great, now consistent.\n\nSo velocity of P on first cylinder is u \\hat{i} - u \\hat{j}.\n\nNow, velocity of P on second cylinder is v_B + ω₂ × BP.\n\nLet me compute v_B. Earlier, we had:\n\nv_B = u + ω₁*(a + b) - v (in some coordinate system). Wait, better to do it properly.\n\nFrom before, the relative velocity of B with respect to A is ω_AB × AB. Since AB is horizontal to the right, and ω_AB is clockwise (negative), then this velocity is downward. The magnitude is |ω_AB|*(a + b). Therefore, velocity of B is velocity of A (u to the right) plus downward velocity |ω_AB|*(a + b). Therefore, v_B = u \\hat{i} - ω_AB*(a + b) \\hat{j}.\n\nBut ω_AB is equal to ω₁ - v/(a + b). Earlier result. With ω₁ = -u/a, so:\n\nω_AB = -u/a - v/(a + b).\n\nTherefore, the downward velocity component is -ω_AB*(a + b) = [u/a + v/(a + b)]*(a + b) = u(a + b)/a + v.\n\nTherefore, velocity of B is u \\hat{i} - [u(a + b)/a + v] \\hat{j}.\n\nNow, velocity of P on second cylinder is v_B + ω₂ × BP.\n\nBP is the vector from B to P, which is to the left (since P is on the first cylinder, left of B). Let me define BP as - (a + b - a) \\hat{i}? Wait, no. The distance between A and B is a + b. Since P is on the first cylinder, the vector from B to P is towards A, so magnitude b, direction from B to A, which is to the left. So BP = -b \\hat{i}.\n\nTherefore, ω₂ × BP is ω₂ \\hat{k} × (-b \\hat{i}) = ω₂ b (\\hat{k} × -\\hat{i}) = ω₂ b (\\hat{j}) since \\hat{k} × \\hat{i} = \\hat{j}, so \\hat{k} × (-\\hat{i}) = -\\hat{k} × \\hat{i} = -\\hat{j}? Wait:\n\nWait, \\hat{k} × \\hat{i} = \\hat{j}, so \\hat{k} × (-\\hat{i}) = - \\hat{k} × \\hat{i} = -\\hat{j}. Therefore, ω₂ × BP = ω₂ b (-\\hat{j}).\n\nBut ω₂ is the angular velocity of the second cylinder. Earlier, we thought it was +v/b. Let me verify.\n\nFrom the no-slip condition, velocity of P on second cylinder equals velocity of P on first cylinder. So:\n\nv_B + ω₂ × BP = u \\hat{i} - u \\hat{j}.\n\nPlugging in v_B and ω₂ × BP:\n\nu \\hat{i} - [u(a + b)/a + v] \\hat{j} + ω₂ b (-\\hat{j}) = u \\hat{i} - u \\hat{j}.\n\nSubtract u \\hat{i} from both sides:\n\n- [u(a + b)/a + v] \\hat{j} - ω₂ b \\hat{j} = -u \\hat{j}.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n[u(a + b)/a + v] \\hat{j} + ω₂ b \\hat{j} = u \\hat{j}.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[u(a + b)/a + v + ω₂ b] = u.\n\nSolving for ω₂:\n\nω₂ b = u - u(a + b)/a - v = u [1 - (a + b)/a] - v = u [ - b/a ] - v.\n\nTherefore:\n\nω₂ = [ - (u b)/a - v ] / b = - u/a - v/b.\n\nSo ω₂ = -u/a - v/b.\n\nBut earlier, we thought that ω₂ was +v/b. There is a contradiction here. Where is the mistake?\n\nEarlier, we considered in the rotating frame that ω₂ (angular velocity of second cylinder) was +v/b, but according to this calculation, it's -u/a - v/b. This suggests that there was an error in the earlier reasoning about the direction of ω₂.\n\nLet me check this result. According to this, ω₂ = -u/a - v/b. Given that u and v are positive (u to the right, v clockwise in the rotating frame), this would make ω₂ negative, i.e., clockwise. Is that consistent with the no-slip condition?\n\nLet me think. If the second cylinder has to rotate clockwise, then at point P, the velocity due to its rotation would be downward (since BP is to the left, clockwise rotation would make P move downward). Adding that to the velocity of B, which has a downward component, would that match the velocity of P on the first cylinder?\n\nFrom the previous equation, we forced equality and found ω₂. Let me plug numbers. Suppose u = a = b = v = 1 for simplicity.\n\nThen ω₂ = -1/1 - 1/1 = -2. So angular velocity of second cylinder is -2 (clockwise). Velocity of P on second cylinder is v_B + ω₂ × BP.\n\nv_B is u \\hat{i} - [u(a + b)/a + v] \\hat{j} = 1 \\hat{i} - [ (1*(1 + 1)/1 + 1 ) ] \\hat{j} = 1 \\hat{i} - [2 + 1] \\hat{j} = 1i - 3j.\n\nω₂ × BP = -2 * 1 * (-j)? Wait, earlier we had ω₂ × BP = ω₂ b (-j). With ω₂ = -2, b = 1, so it's -2 * 1 * (-j)? Wait no:\n\nWait earlier, we had ω₂ × BP = ω₂ b (-\\hat{j}). With ω₂ = -2, this becomes -2 * 1 * (-\\hat{j})? No:\n\nWait the expression was:\n\nFrom before:\n\nω₂ × BP = ω₂ b (-\\hat{j}).\n\nWait no, let's re-derive it. BP is -b \\hat{i}. ω₂ is a scalar (angular velocity). The cross product ω₂ × BP is actually ω₂ \\hat{k} × BP. Since ω₂ is the z-component.\n\nSo ω₂ \\hat{k} × (-b \\hat{i}) = -b ω₂ (\\hat{k} × \\hat{i}) = -b ω₂ \\hat{j}.\n\nTherefore, with ω₂ = -2, this is -b*(-2)*\\hat{j} = 2b \\hat{j}. With b=1, it's 2 \\hat{j}.\n\nTherefore, velocity of P on second cylinder is v_B + ω₂ × BP = (1i - 3j) + 2j = 1i - j.\n\nVelocity of P on first cylinder is u i - u j = 1i - 1j. Which matches! Great, so it works out. Therefore, ω₂ = -u/a - v/b is correct. Earlier reasoning about the direction was incorrect because I forgot that the velocity of B itself has a downward component, which affects the total.\n\nTherefore, the angular velocity of the second cylinder is ω₂ = -u/a - v/b, which is clockwise.\n\nBut how does this relate to our previous result for ω_AB?\n\nWe had earlier found that ω_AB = -u/a - v/(a + b).\n\nBut the question is not asking about ω₂, it's asking about ω_AB. However, this calculation confirms that our earlier result for ω_AB is consistent with the no-slip condition.\n\nTherefore, the angular velocity of AB relative to the inertial frame is ω_AB = ω₁ - v/(a + b), and since ω₁ = -u/a, it becomes -u/a - v/(a + b).\n\nBut angular velocity is a vector, but since everything is in the plane, we can just give the magnitude with sign. Depending on the coordinate system, but the question probably expects the magnitude and direction, or expressed as a vector. However, since it just says \"angular velocity\", likely as a scalar with sign or expressed in terms of direction.\n\nBut let me check units. u has units of length/time, a and b are lengths. So u/a is 1/time, v/(a + b) is also 1/time. So the units are consistent.\n\nBut let me think again about the derivation of ω_AB. We had:\n\nThe relative velocity of B with respect to A is v_B - u = ω_AB × AB. Since AB is a vector, and ω_AB is the angular velocity, then |v_B - u| = ω_AB * |AB|.\n\nEarlier, we found that v_B - u = ω₁*(a + b) - v (in magnitude?), but actually, we did a vector calculation and found that ω_AB = -u/a - v/(a + b). Let me confirm with the numbers I used earlier: u = a = b = v = 1. Then ω_AB = -1/1 - 1/(1 + 1) = -1 - 0.5 = -1.5. Let's see if that matches.\n\nIn that case, AB is horizontal, length a + b = 2. The velocity of B relative to A is downward with magnitude [u(a + b)/a + v] = [1*2/1 + 1] = 3. Therefore, |v_B - u| = 3, and ω_AB = 3 / |AB| = 3 / 2 = 1.5, but since it's clockwise, it's -1.5. Which matches our result. So yes, ω_AB = -u/a - v/(a + b).\n\nTherefore, the angular velocity of AB relative to the inertial frame is - (u/a + v/(a + b)). Depending on the convention, if clockwise is considered negative, then this is the answer.\n\nBut let me check another case. Suppose v = 0. Then the second cylinder is not moving relative to the first cylinder. Therefore, the angular velocity of AB should just be the angular velocity of the first cylinder, which is -u/a. Plugging v = 0 into our formula gives -u/a - 0 = -u/a. Correct.\n\nAnother case: u = 0. If the first cylinder is not moving, but just rotating? Wait, but if it's rolling without slipping on a horizontal plane, u = 0 implies ω₁ = 0. Wait, no. Rolling without slipping requires v = ω*r. If the center is not moving, then it's spinning in place, which is not rolling without slipping on a plane. Therefore, u cannot be zero. So maybe that case is invalid. Let me take u approaching zero. If u approaches zero, then ω_AB approaches -v/(a + b). Which makes sense, since the first cylinder is almost stationary, and the second cylinder is moving around it with angular velocity -v/(a + b), hence the total angular velocity is just that.\n\nTherefore, the result seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the angular velocity of AB relative to the inertial frame is - (u/a + v/(a + b)). Depending on the convention, if they want the magnitude and direction, it would be clockwise with magnitude u/a + v/(a + b). But the question says \"angular velocity\", and in physics, angular velocity is a vector, but since it's in a plane, often expressed as a scalar with sign. Given that, and the problem doesn't specify direction, but asks for angular velocity relative to inertial frame, the answer is - (u/a + v/(a + b)). But let me check if there is a different convention.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have a sign error. Let me think about the direction. If the first cylinder is rolling to the right, then its angular velocity is clockwise. The second cylinder is rolling on it, with B moving relative to the first cylinder. If v is such that B is moving clockwise around A in the rotating frame, then the total angular velocity of AB is more clockwise. Hence negative. So the answer is negative of (u/a + v/(a + b)). Therefore, expressed as a vector, it would be into the plane (if using right-hand rule), but since it's clockwise, it's negative.\n\nBut the problem says \"angular velocity of the line AB relative to the inertial reference frame\". So likely expects the answer as a magnitude with direction specified, or expressed in terms of the given variables with proper sign.\n\nHowever, since the problem mentions \"angular velocity\", and in rotational dynamics, angular velocity is typically given as a vector, but in planar motion, it's often sufficient to specify the magnitude and direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). However, since the problem is likely expecting an algebraic expression, and given that in the calculation we arrived at - (u/a + v/(a + b)), but depending on the coordinate system.\n\nBut let me think again about the derivation of ω_AB. We had:\n\nω_AB = ω₁ + ω₂', where ω₂' is the angular velocity of B around A in the rotating frame. Earlier, we thought ω₂' = -v/(a + b), hence ω_AB = ω₁ + (-v/(a + b)) = -u/a - v/(a + b). Which matches.\n\nAlternatively, since in the inertial frame, the angular velocity of AB is the sum of the angular velocity of the first cylinder and the angular velocity of B relative to the first cylinder. Since the first cylinder is rotating at ω₁, and B is rotating around A at ω₂' = -v/(a + b), then yes, ω_AB = ω₁ + ω₂'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ω_AB = - (u/a + v/(a + b)).\n\nBut to confirm, let me check with another approach. Let me parameterize the motion.\n\nLet me assume that at time t, the angle of the first cylinder is θ₁(t), and the angle of the line AB relative to some fixed direction is θ(t). Since the first cylinder is rolling without slipping on the plane with velocity u, the angle θ₁(t) is related to the distance traveled by the center A. The distance traveled by A is x_A(t) = u t. For rolling without slipping, the rotation angle θ₁(t) = x_A(t)/a = (u t)/a. Therefore, θ₁(t) = (u/a) t. However, since it's rolling to the right, the rotation is clockwise, so if we take θ₁ as clockwise, then θ₁(t) = - (u/a) t if we take counterclockwise as positive.\n\nNow, in the rotating frame of the first cylinder, which is rotating with angular velocity ω₁ = -u/a, the center B is moving with angular velocity ω₂' = -v/(a + b) (clockwise). Therefore, the angle of AB in the rotating frame is θ'(t) = ω₂' t = - (v/(a + b)) t. Therefore, the angle of AB in the inertial frame is θ(t) = θ₁(t) + θ'(t) = - (u/a) t - (v/(a + b)) t = - [u/a + v/(a + b)] t. Therefore, the angular velocity is dθ/dt = - [u/a + v/(a + b)], which matches our previous result.\n\nYes! This confirms it. Therefore, the angular velocity of AB relative to the inertial frame is - (u/a + v/(a + b)). Depending on the convention, if they want the magnitude and specify direction, it's clockwise with magnitude u/a + v/(a + b). But since the problem asks for angular velocity, and in physics angular velocity can be negative depending on direction, so likely the answer is - (u/a + v/(a + b)). However, the problem might expect the magnitude, but given the derivation, I think the signed value is appropriate.\n\nBut let me check units again. u has units of velocity, a and b are lengths. u/a is 1/time, v/(a + b) is also 1/time. So adding them is okay. The result has units of 1/time, which is angular velocity. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be - (u/a + v/(a + b)). But let me check if there is a different expression. Alternatively, combining the terms:\n\n- [ u/a + v/(a + b) ] = - [ u(a + b) + v a ] / [a(a + b)].\n\nBut unless there is a reason to combine them, probably leave it as - (u/a + v/(a + b)).\n\nBut let me check if the problem specifies direction. The problem says \"angular velocity of the line AB relative to the inertial reference frame\". Since angular velocity is a vector, but in planar motion, it's conventional to specify the magnitude and direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). Given that both terms are negative (assuming u and v are positive in the direction of motion), the total angular velocity is clockwise. So the magnitude is u/a + v/(a + b), direction clockwise.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in vector form, but since it's a planar problem and the direction is fully specified by clockwise or counterclockwise, and given that the question is likely expecting an algebraic expression, I think writing it as - (u/a + v/(a + b)) is acceptable, with the understanding that clockwise is negative. However, depending on the convention used in the course or textbook, sometimes clockwise is considered positive. But since in physics the right-hand rule is standard, where counterclockwise is positive, I think negative is correct here.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the magnitude and specifies direction, it would be (u/a + v/(a + b)) clockwise. But since the problem says \"angular velocity\", and in vector terms, it's - (u/a + v/(a + b)) in the z-direction.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement: it says \"Determine the angular velocity of the line AB relative to the inertial reference frame.\" Given that it's a math/physics problem, and in such contexts, angular velocity is often expressed as a magnitude with direction specified. However, since the problem is likely expecting an expression in terms of u, v, a, b, and possibly specifying direction, but since it's in a plane, and given that both motions contribute to the same direction (clockwise), I think the answer is the sum of the two angular velocities, both clockwise.\n\nTherefore, the angular velocity is u/a + v/(a + b) clockwise. But since in our calculation it came out as negative, depending on the coordinate system.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a coordinate system, and just asks for the angular velocity, it's safer to give the magnitude and state the direction. However, since the answer needs to be in boxed notation, likely as an algebraic expression. Given that in rotational motion problems, especially in physics, angular velocity is often given with sign based on right-hand rule, but since the problem is about rolling cylinders, and given that both contributions are clockwise, the answer is likely expected to be expressed as the sum, with a note on direction. However, since the user hasn't specified, and given that in our derivation it came out as - (u/a + v/(a + b)), but depending on convention.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the parameterization approach, we had θ(t) = - [u/a + v/(a + b)] t, so angular velocity is dθ/dt = - [u/a + v/(a + b)]. If we define counterclockwise as positive, then this is negative, i.e., clockwise. Therefore, the magnitude is u/a + v/(a + b), direction clockwise.\n\nSince the problem asks for angular velocity, and in many contexts, especially in exams or textbooks, if direction is required, it's specified. However, given that it's a mathematical problem, and the answer is likely expected to be in terms of magnitude and direction, but since the user just said \"put the final answer within \\boxed{}\", and given that angular velocity can be a vector, but here it's in a plane, and the problem may expect the magnitude with direction indicated by sign based on a standard convention.\n\nBut since different conventions exist, and to match the derivation, I think the answer is - (u/a + v/(a + b)) with the understanding that clockwise is negative. However, if the problem expects a positive value with direction specified, it would be u/a + v/(a + b) clockwise. But since the question is from a physics context, and in physics angular velocity is a vector, but in planar problems often expressed as scalar with sign, I think the former is acceptable.\n\nBut to check, let me see if there's an alternative derivation that gives a positive value. Suppose we define clockwise as positive. Then ω₁ = u/a (clockwise positive), ω₂' = v/(a + b) (clockwise positive). Then total angular velocity would be ω₁ + ω₂' = u/a + v/(a + b). But in this case, the sign depends on the convention. Since the problem didn't specify, but in physics standard is counterclockwise positive, so our previous result of - (u/a + v/(a + b)) is correct.\n\nHowever, given that the problem is likely expecting a positive answer with direction, but since the user just wants the answer boxed, and in many cases such problems expect the magnitude, I need to infer.\n\nWait, let me check similar problems. In rolling without slipping problems, when you have a wheel rolling on another wheel, the angular velocities add or subtract depending on the direction. In this case, since both motions contribute to the same direction of rotation of AB, the total angular velocity should be the sum of the two angular velocities. Therefore, if I express it as a magnitude with direction, it's the sum, clockwise. However, since the problem says \"angular velocity\", and doesn't specify to give magnitude, I think safest is to give the signed value assuming standard coordinate system.\n\nBut since the problem is in English, and in many cases in physics, when you have rotation about a point, angular velocity is often given with sign. Given that, and our derivation shows it's negative, I think the answer is - (u/a + v/(a + b)). However, to make sure, let me check dimensions again.\n\nYes, units are correct. The expression is correct.\n\nTherefore, the angular velocity of AB relative to the inertial frame is - (u/a + v/(a + b)). But since the problem may expect the magnitude, but given that the derivation shows it's negative in standard coordinates, I will go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular velocity of the line $ AB $ relative to the inertial reference frame is \\boxed{-\\left( \\dfrac{u}{a} + \\dfrac{v}{a + b} \\right)}.\n</think>"}
