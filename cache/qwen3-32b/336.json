The problem gives me the energy dispersion relation for rotons as E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)². The density of states is a function that tells us how many states are available at a given energy E. Since this is in three dimensions and involves a volume V, I remember that the general formula for the density of states in 3D involves integrating over the momentum space.\n\nFirst, let me recall the general formula for the density of states. In three dimensions, the density of states g(E) is given by the integral over all momentum states that have energy between E and E + dE. The formula is usually something like:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2πħ³)) * ∫ d³p δ(E - E(p))\n\nBut since we need to convert this into an expression in terms of E, we can use the fact that for each E, there's a spherical shell in momentum space where E(p) = E. However, in this case, the dispersion relation is not linear (like for phonons) or simple quadratic around p=0, but instead has a minimum at p = p₀. So the usual approach for free particles (E(p) = p²/(2m)) might need some modification.\n\nLet me think. For a free particle, the density of states is proportional to sqrt(E) because the number of states with momentum between p and p + dp is proportional to p² dp, and since E ~ p², we can express p in terms of E and substitute. But here, the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)². So first, I need to invert this relation to express p in terms of E.\n\nLet me define q = p - p₀. Then E(q) = Δ + b q². So q² = (E - Δ)/b. Therefore, |q| = sqrt[(E - Δ)/b]. But since q is a vector, the magnitude |q| is sqrt[(E - Δ)/b]. Therefore, the magnitude of p is |p| = |q + p₀|. Wait, no. Actually, q = p - p₀, so p = q + p₀. However, since q is a vector, then p is the vector q shifted by p₀. But the energy depends only on the magnitude of q. Therefore, for each E ≥ Δ, the set of p's that satisfy E(p) = E is a sphere in momentum space centered at p₀ with radius sqrt[(E - Δ)/b]. \n\nTherefore, to compute the density of states, we need to find the number of states on this sphere and then integrate over the delta function. Alternatively, we can parametrize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can do a change of variables. Let me consider that the density of states in 3D is:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2πħ³)) * ∫ δ(E - E(p)) d³p\n\nLet me make a substitution. Let me define q = p - p₀. Then d³p = d³q. Then:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2πħ³)) * ∫ δ(E - Δ - b q²) d³q\n\nThis is similar to the standard free particle case, except that here the energy is E' = b q², so the density of states would be similar but scaled. Let me recall that for E' = (q²)/(2m), the density of states is:\n\ng'(E') = (V / (2π²ħ³)) * (2π (2m E')^(1/2)) * (2m E') )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the standard formula. For E = p²/(2m), the density of states is:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2π²ħ³)) * (4π p²) * (dp/dE)\n\nBut since E = p²/(2m), then p = sqrt(2mE), and dp/dE = sqrt(2m)/(2 sqrt(E)). Therefore:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2π²ħ³)) * 4π (2mE) * sqrt(2m)/(2 sqrt(E)) )\n\nSimplifying:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2π²ħ³)) * 4π * sqrt(2m) * sqrt(E) * 2m )\n\nWait, maybe I should do it step by step. Let me think again. The standard approach is:\n\nFor a given E, the number of states with energy between E and E + dE is equal to the volume of the spherical shell in momentum space multiplied by the density of states in momentum space. The volume of the shell is 4πp² dp. Then, since E = p²/(2m), dp/dE = (dE/dp)^{-1} = (p/m)^{-1} = m/p. Therefore, the density of states is:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2πħ)^3) * 4πp² (dp/dE)\n\nWhich gives:\n\ng(E) = V/(2π²ħ³) * 4π p² * m/(2p) )? Wait:\n\nWait, the standard formula is:\n\ng(E) dE = (V / (2πħ)^3) * 4π p² dp\n\nBut since dp = (dE/dp)^{-1} dE = (p/m) dE, so:\n\ng(E) dE = (V / (2πħ)^3) * 4π p² * (m/p) dE )\n\nTherefore:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2π²ħ³)) * 2π m p\n\nBut since p = sqrt(2mE), then:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2π²ħ³)) * 2π m * sqrt(2mE) ) = (V / (π ħ³)) * m^(3/2) sqrt(2E) / 2π ... Wait, maybe I need to do this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the delta function approach. For the standard case, E(p) = p²/(2m). Then,\n\ng(E) = (V/(2πħ)^3)) ∫ δ(E - p²/(2m)) d³p\n\nWe can switch to spherical coordinates:\n\ng(E) = (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π ∫₀^∞ δ(E - p²/(2m)) p² dp\n\nLet me make substitution x = p²/(2m), so p = sqrt(2m x), dp = sqrt(2m/(2 sqrt(x))) dx = sqrt(m/(2x)) dx. Wait, derivative of p with respect to x is dp/dx = (1/(2 sqrt(2m x))) * 2 sqrt(2m) )? Maybe better to do:\n\nLet me set E = p²/(2m). Then, p² = 2mE, so p = sqrt(2mE). Then, the delta function δ(E - p²/(2m)) can be written as δ(p²/(2m) - E). Let me use the formula for delta function of a function:\n\nδ(f(p)) = Σ δ(p - p_i)/|f’(p_i)|, where p_i are the roots of f(p) = 0.\n\nIn this case, f(p) = p²/(2m) - E. The roots are p = ±sqrt(2mE). But since we are integrating over p from 0 to ∞ (in spherical coordinates), we take the positive root. Therefore,\n\nδ(p²/(2m) - E) = δ(p - sqrt(2mE)) * (2m)/(2p) ) = δ(p - sqrt(2mE)) * m/p.\n\nTherefore,\n\ng(E) = (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π ∫₀^∞ [δ(p - sqrt(2mE)) * m/p ] p² dp\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π m ∫₀^∞ δ(p - sqrt(2mE)) p dp\n\nThe integral becomes sqrt(2mE), so:\n\ng(E) = (V/(2π²ħ³)) * 2π * m * sqrt(2mE)\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nAfter substitution, the integral becomes:\n\n4π * [m / p] * p² dp integrated over delta function. The [m/p] * p² = m p. Then:\n\ng(E) = (V/(2π²ħ³)) * 4π * m * sqrt(2mE) / 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original expression:\n\n(V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π * m ∫ p δ(p - sqrt(2mE)) dp\n\nThe integral ∫ p δ(...) dp is just sqrt(2mE). Therefore,\n\ng(E) = (V/(2π²ħ³)) * 4π * m * sqrt(2mE) ?\n\nWait, the original coefficient was (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π. Let me compute (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π:\n\n(4π V) / (2πħ)^3 ) = (4π V) / (8 π³ ħ³) ) * 2? Wait:\n\nWait (2πħ)^3 is 8 π³ ħ³. Therefore:\n\n(4π V) / (8 π³ ħ³) ) = V/(2 π² ħ³). So then multiplied by m * sqrt(2mE):\n\ng(E) = V/(2 π² ħ³) * m * sqrt(2mE)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\ng(E) = V m / (2 π² ħ³) * sqrt(2mE) = V / (2 π² ħ³) * (2m² E)^{1/2} * m^{1/2} ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait sqrt(2mE) is (2mE)^{1/2} and multiplied by m:\n\nm * (2mE)^{1/2} = 2^{1/2} m^{3/2} E^{1/2}\n\nTherefore, overall:\n\ng(E) = V * 2^{1/2} m^{3/2} / (2 π² ħ³) * E^{1/2}\n\nSimplify 2^{1/2}/2 = 1/√2:\n\ng(E) = V * m^{3/2} / ( √2 π² ħ³ ) * √E\n\nBut regardless of the exact coefficients, the point is that for the standard free particle case, the density of states goes as sqrt(E).\n\nBut in our problem, the dispersion is E(q) = Δ + b q², where q = p - p₀. So similar to the free particle case, but with a shift in momentum and a different coefficient.\n\nSo following the same approach as above, let's compute the density of states for E(q) = Δ + b q².\n\nSo starting again, the density of states is:\n\ng(E) = (V/(2πħ)^3)) ∫ δ(E - Δ - b q²) d³q\n\nAgain, switching to spherical coordinates in q:\n\ng(E) = (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π ∫₀^∞ δ(E - Δ - b q²) q² dq\n\nLet me define x = b q², so q² = (E - Δ)/b, so q = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ). Let me perform substitution.\n\nLet me let u = q², then du = 2q dq, so dq = du/(2q). But maybe better to use the delta function approach.\n\nLet me write f(q) = b q² + Δ - E. Wait, original delta function is δ(E - Δ - b q²) = δ( b q² - (E - Δ) ). Let me set f(q) = b q² - (E - Δ). The roots are at q = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ). Since q ≥ 0, only the positive root is considered.\n\nSo using the delta function formula:\n\nδ(f(q)) = δ(b q² - (E - Δ)) = δ(q - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )) / |df/dq| evaluated at the root.\n\ndf/dq = 2b q. At q = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ), this is 2b * sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) = 2b * sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) = 2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) ) * sqrt(1/b) ? Wait:\n\nWait sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) multiplied by b is b * sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) = sqrt( b² (E - Δ)/b ) = sqrt( b (E - Δ) ). Yes.\n\nSo |df/dq| = 2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) )\n\nTherefore, the delta function becomes:\n\nδ(b q² - (E - Δ)) = δ(q - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )) / [ 2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) ) ]\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the expression for g(E):\n\ng(E) = (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π ∫₀^∞ δ(b q² - (E - Δ)) q² dq\n\n= (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π * [ 1 / ( 2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) )) ) ] * [ q² ] evaluated at q = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )\n\nCompute q² at that point: q² = (E - Δ)/b.\n\nTherefore:\n\ng(E) = (V/(2πħ)^3)) * 4π * [ 1 / ( 2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) )) ) ] * (E - Δ)/b\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, note that 4π / (2πħ)^3 = 4π / (8 π³ ħ³) ) * 2? Wait:\n\nWait (2πħ)^3 is 8 π³ ħ³. Therefore:\n\n(V / (8 π³ ħ³)) * 4 π = V / (2 π² ħ³ )\n\nSo the coefficient becomes V/(2 π² ħ³ ) multiplied by the rest:\n\n[ 1 / ( 2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) )) ) ] * (E - Δ)/b = [ (E - Δ)/b ] / [ 2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) ) ] = [ sqrt(E - Δ)/sqrt(b) ) / b ] / 2 = [ sqrt(E - Δ) / b^(3/2) ] / 2 ?\n\nWait let me compute step by step:\n\nNumerator: (E - Δ)/b\n\nDenominator: 2 sqrt(b (E - Δ))\n\nSo overall:\n\n[(E - Δ)/b] / [2 sqrt(b (E - Δ))] = [ (E - Δ) / b ] * 1 / [ 2 (b (E - Δ))^{1/2} ) ] \n\n= [ (E - Δ) / b ] * 1 / [ 2 b^{1/2} (E - Δ)^{1/2} ) ]\n\n= [ (E - Δ)^{1 - 1/2} ] / [ 2 b^{1 + 1/2} ) ]\n\n= [ (E - Δ)^{1/2} ] / [ 2 b^{3/2} ) ]\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\ng(E) = [ V / (2 π² ħ³ ) ] * [ sqrt(E - Δ) / ( 2 b^{3/2} ) ) ] \n\nWait no, the previous step was:\n\ng(E) = [ V/(2 π² ħ³ ) ] * [ (E - Δ)^{1/2} / ( 2 b^{3/2} ) ) ]\n\nWait, no, let me check again:\n\nOriginal expression after substitution:\n\ng(E) = [V/(2 π² ħ³ ) ] * [ (E - Δ)/b ] / [ 2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) ) ]\n\nLet me write [ (E - Δ)/b ] divided by [ 2 sqrt(b (E - Δ)) ] as:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= (E - Δ)/b / [ 2 (b (E - Δ))^{1/2} ) ] \n\n= (E - Δ)^{1 - 1/2} / [ 2 b^{1 + 1/2} ) ]\n\n= (E - Δ)^{1/2} / [ 2 b^{3/2} ) ]\n\nTherefore:\n\ng(E) = [ V / (2 π² ħ³ ) ] * [ (E - Δ)^{1/2} / ( 2 b^{3/2} ) ) ] \n\n= V / (4 π² ħ³ b^{3/2} ) * sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nBut this seems different from the options given. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [ (E - Δ)/b + p₀ ] / [ 2 sqrt(b(E - Δ)) ]\n\nB: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ (p₀ - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ))² ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nC: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [ p₀² + (E - Δ)/b ] / sqrt( b(E - Δ) )\n\nD: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ (p₀ + sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ))² ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nWait, my result was g(E) = V / (4 π² ħ³ b^{3/2} ) * sqrt(E - Δ) = V/(4 π² ħ³) * sqrt(E - Δ)/b^{3/2} \n\nBut none of the options directly look like this. However, note that in my calculation, I considered the dispersion E(q) = Δ + b q² where q = p - p₀. However, the original problem says that the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2. So in my calculation, I changed variables to q = p - p₀, so the density of states depends only on q, and p₀ is just a shift in momentum. However, in the standard case, when you have a dispersion that depends on p - p₀, but you are calculating the density of states in terms of p, does the p₀ affect the density of states? \n\nWait, the density of states is a function of energy, and since the dispersion is shifted in momentum, but the density of states depends on the number of states at a given energy. However, in my calculation, I found that the density of states only depends on the curvature of the dispersion (the coefficient b) and not on p₀. However, in the given options, p₀ is present. This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation, or perhaps there's an additional consideration.\n\nWait, let me think again. The density of states is calculated based on the number of states with energy E. The shift in momentum p₀ would affect the position of the sphere in momentum space, but since we are integrating over all p, the volume of the sphere (i.e., the number of states) should not depend on where the sphere is located in momentum space, only on its radius. Therefore, p₀ should not appear in the density of states. However, in the given options, p₀ is present, which suggests that perhaps my approach is missing something.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"density of states for rotons\". However, in reality, the roton dispersion has a minimum at p₀, and the density of states might involve contributions from the curvature and the shift. However, according to the calculation, p₀ does not enter into the expression. But in the options given, all options except none have p₀ in them. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait in my calculation, I had q = p - p₀, and the density of states ended up depending only on b and E - Δ. However, in the options, there are terms with p₀. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. Maybe I missed a step where p₀ comes into play?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. The original dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2. But in my calculation, I changed variables to q = p - p₀, and then the density of states became that of a free particle with E(q) = Δ + b q². But when calculating the density of states, the shift in momentum should not affect the result because the number of states with a given energy depends only on the curvature of the dispersion, not on where the minimum is. However, the options suggest that p₀ is involved. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the substitution q = p - p₀ removes p₀ entirely. Maybe I need to consider that the original momentum p is related to q, and when converting the density of states, perhaps there's an additional term.\n\nWait, but no. The density of states is about how many states have a given energy, regardless of their position in momentum space. If the dispersion is shifted, the number of states at a given energy should still be determined by the radius of the sphere in momentum space, which is determined by the energy. So p₀ shouldn't matter. Therefore, if my calculation is correct, none of the options A-D would be correct because they all have p₀ terms. However, this seems unlikely. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again. It says \"density of states for rotons\". The density of states is usually defined as the number of states per unit energy. However, perhaps there is a different definition here? Or maybe the question is about the density of states in terms of momentum, but no, the question says \"for rotons\", which would be as a function of energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given dispersion is not E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2, but E(p) = Δ + b(p² - p₀²). Wait, no, the problem says \"grows quadratically from this minimum as E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2\". So it's definitely (p - p₀)^2.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, I found that the density of states does not depend on p₀, but the options do. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in my calculation, I changed variables to q = p - p₀. Therefore, the integral over p becomes integral over q. Then, the delta function becomes δ(E - Δ - b q²). Therefore, the result is independent of p₀. Therefore, the density of states does not depend on p₀. However, the options all have p₀. Therefore, perhaps the question is not about the density of states in the entire momentum space, but only for the roton branch? Or maybe there is an additional term?\n\nWait, but the density of states is a global property, not just for the roton branch. However, in reality, superfluid helium has multiple branches of excitations: phonons at low momenta and rotons at higher momenta. The problem is specifically about the roton branch. However, when calculating the density of states, you would include all states contributing to that energy. However, assuming that at the energy E, only the roton branch contributes (which is a good approximation if we are considering E above Δ and not too high), then the calculation should be as I did. Hence, p₀ shouldn't appear.\n\nBut since the options have p₀, I must have made a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider that the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)². Let me try to express p in terms of E. For a given E ≥ Δ, the solutions for p are:\n\np = p₀ ± sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )\n\nBut since p is a vector, there are infinitely many p's with |p - p₀| = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ). However, when calculating the density of states, we need to consider the Jacobian of the transformation from p to E. But perhaps the problem is considering some other definition?\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the density of states in terms of the magnitude of p? No, the density of states is usually a function of energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is confusion between the density of states in terms of p and in terms of E. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not about the density of states for the entire system, but for the roton excitation specifically, taking into account that the minimum is at p₀. However, even so, the density of states is determined by the number of states at a given energy, which should not depend on p₀.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a factor in the calculation? Let me redo the calculation carefully.\n\nStarting again:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2πħ)^3 ) ∫ δ(E - Δ - b(p - p₀)^2 ) d³p\n\nLet me make substitution q = p - p₀. Then d³p = d³q, and:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2πħ)^3 ) ∫ δ(E - Δ - b q² ) d³q\n\nAs before, switching to spherical coordinates:\n\n= (V / (2πħ)^3 ) * 4π ∫₀^∞ δ(E - Δ - b q² ) q² dq\n\nLet me make substitution x = q². Then q = sqrt(x), dq = dx/(2 sqrt(x)). But maybe better to use the delta function properties.\n\nLet me define f(q) = b q² + Δ - E. The roots are at q = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ). The derivative df/dq = 2b q. Therefore, using the delta function formula:\n\nδ(f(q)) = δ(b q² - (E - Δ)) = δ(q - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )) / |2b q| evaluated at the root.\n\nTherefore:\n\nδ(b q² - (E - Δ)) = δ(q - q₀) / (2b q₀), where q₀ = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )\n\nTherefore:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2πħ)^3 ) * 4π ∫₀^∞ [ δ(q - q₀) / (2b q₀) ] q² dq\n\n= (V / (2πħ)^3 ) * 4π * [ q₀² / (2b q₀) ) ] \n\n= (V / (2πħ)^3 ) * 4π * [ q₀ / (2b) ) ]\n\nNow, q₀ = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ), so:\n\ng(E) = (V / (2πħ)^3 ) * 4π * [ sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) / (2b) ) ] \n\nSimplify:\n\n4π / (2πħ)^3 = 4π / (8 π³ ħ³ ) = 1 / (2 π² ħ³ )\n\nThen:\n\ng(E) = [ 1 / (2 π² ħ³ ) ] * V * [ sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) / (2b) ) ] \n\n= V / (4 π² ħ³ b^{3/2} ) * sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nWhich is the same result as before. So the density of states is proportional to sqrt(E - Δ) and inversely proportional to b^{3/2}, and does not depend on p₀. However, the options given all have p₀ in them. This suggests that either the options are incorrect, or I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: it says \"density of states for rotons\". Perhaps the question is not about the standard density of states, but about something else? For example, in some contexts, the density of states might be expressed in terms of the momentum, or there might be an additional consideration of the effective mass?\n\nWait, the problem mentions that b is inversely related to the effective mass. For a free particle, E = p²/(2m), so comparing to E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2, we can think of b as 1/(2m*), where m* is the effective mass. So b = 1/(2m*). Therefore, m* = 1/(2b). However, this doesn't introduce p₀ into the density of states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the density of states in terms of the magnitude of momentum p, but that seems unlikely since the standard density of states is in terms of energy.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the dispersion relation. The problem says \"grows quadratically from this minimum as E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2\". However, usually, the dispersion for rotons is approximated as E(p) = Δ - α(p - p₀) + β(p - p₀)^2, which is a minimum at p = p₀. But in the problem, it's given as E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2, so purely quadratic. So no linear term. Hence, the minimum is at p = p₀, and the curvature is 2b.\n\nBut regardless, my calculation shows that the density of states does not depend on p₀. Therefore, if the options given all include p₀, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem, or I have missed something.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [ (E - Δ)/b + p₀ ] / [ 2 sqrt(b(E - Δ)) ]\n\nB: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ (p₀ - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ))² ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nC: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [ p₀² + (E - Δ)/b ] / sqrt( b(E - Δ) )\n\nD: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ (p₀ + sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ))² ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nLet me try to simplify option B and D to see if they reduce to my result when p₀ is zero.\n\nIf p₀ = 0, then the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b p², and the density of states should be what I calculated: g(E) = V/(4 π² ħ³ b^{3/2}) * sqrt(E - Δ).\n\nLet me check option B with p₀ = 0:\n\nOption B becomes:\n\n[V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ (0 - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ))² ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\n= [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ ( (E - Δ)/b ) ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\n= [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * sqrt(E - Δ)/sqrt(b)\n\n= [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [ sqrt(E - Δ) / (2 b^{3/2} ) ]\n\n= V/(4 π² ħ³ b^{3/2}) * sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nWhich matches my result! So option B, when p₀ = 0, gives the correct expression. However, when p₀ ≠ 0, it has an additional term. But according to my calculation, p₀ should not appear. However, when p₀ ≠ 0, the expression in option B includes terms with p₀. But according to my calculation, when p₀ ≠ 0, the density of states should be the same as when p₀ = 0. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. Wait, but if p₀ is non-zero, how does it affect the calculation?\n\nWait, in my calculation, when I did the substitution q = p - p₀, I effectively shifted the momentum, and the density of states became independent of p₀. However, in option B, when p₀ is non-zero, there is an extra factor. This suggests that there might be an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is about rotons, which have a dispersion with a minimum at p₀. However, in reality, the density of states might involve contributions from other branches, but the problem specifies that we are to consider only the roton branch. However, in our calculation, we considered only the roton branch, and found that the density of states is independent of p₀. But option B, when p₀ is non-zero, gives a different expression. Let me expand option B:\n\nOption B is:\n\n[V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [p₀ - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )]^2 / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n[p₀ - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )]^2 = p₀² - 2 p₀ sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) + (E - Δ)/b\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n[V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ p₀² - 2 p₀ sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) + (E - Δ)/b ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\n= [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] [ p₀² / sqrt(E - Δ) - 2 p₀ / sqrt(b) + sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) / 1 ]\n\nHmm, this seems to have terms that depend on p₀, which according to our previous calculation should not be there. But when p₀ = 0, it reduces to the correct expression. This suggests that maybe the question assumes that the dispersion is not E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2, but something else? Or perhaps there is a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the density of states not just for the roton branch, but including the contribution from the phonon branch? But the problem says \"roton-like elementary excitations\", so it should be only the roton branch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a misunderstanding in the dispersion relation. Suppose the dispersion is actually E(p) = Δ + b(p² - p₀²). This would make the minimum at p = p₀, since dE/dp = 2b p, which would be zero at p = 0, but if it's E(p) = Δ + b(p² - p₀²), then it's a parabola opening upwards with minimum at p = 0, but shifted by -b p₀² + Δ. Wait, no, that would give E(p) = Δ - b p₀² + b p², which has minimum at p=0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2 - b p₀², which would make it E(p) = Δ - b p₀² + b(p - p₀)^2 + b p₀²? No, this seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different definition of density of states. For example, in some contexts, people might define the density of states in terms of the magnitude of momentum, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is in 1D? No, the volume V suggests it's 3D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try to derive the density of states using another method. Let's consider that for each energy E, the number of states is the volume of the spherical shell in momentum space where E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2. This shell is a sphere with radius sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) centered at p₀. The volume of this sphere in momentum space is the number of states multiplied by (2πħ)^3 / V. Wait, no, the number of states in a volume d³p is V d³p / (2πħ)^3. Therefore, the number of states with energy between E and E + dE is V * (surface area of the sphere) * |dp/dE| / (2πħ)^3.\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is 4π q², where q = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ). Therefore, surface area is 4π ( (E - Δ)/b ). Then, dp/dE: since q = sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ), then dq/dE = 1/(2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) )). Therefore, the number of states is:\n\ng(E) dE = V / (2πħ)^3 * 4π q² * dq/dE dE\n\nThus:\n\ng(E) = V / (2πħ)^3 * 4π q² * dq/dE\n\nPlugging in q² = (E - Δ)/b, and dq/dE = 1/(2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) )):\n\ng(E) = V / (2πħ)^3 * 4π * (E - Δ)/b * 1/(2 sqrt( b (E - Δ) )) \n\n= V / (2πħ)^3 * 2π * (E - Δ)/b / sqrt( b (E - Δ) )\n\n= V / (2πħ)^3 * 2π * sqrt(E - Δ)/b^{3/2}\n\nSimplify:\n\n2π / (2πħ)^3 = 1 / (2 π² ħ³ )\n\nThus:\n\ng(E) = V / (2 π² ħ³ ) * sqrt(E - Δ)/b^{3/2}\n\nWhich is the same result as before. So again, no p₀. Therefore, if the correct answer is supposed to be one of the options, and when p₀ = 0, option B reduces to the correct expression, but when p₀ ≠ 0, it introduces extra terms, this suggests that perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps the given options are incorrect.\n\nHowever, since the problem gives options with p₀, and when p₀ = 0, option B gives the correct result, it's possible that the intended answer is B, assuming that there is an error in the derivation where p₀ should not appear but does due to some miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a different form of the dispersion.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the dispersion is not E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2, but E(p) = Δ + b(p² - p₀²). In that case, the minimum is at p = 0, and the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p² - p₀²). But this would give E(p) = Δ - b p₀² + b p², which has a minimum at p=0. However, the problem says the minimum is at p = p₀. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p² - 2 p p₀ + p₀²) = Δ + b p² - 2b p p₀ + b p₀². If we rearrange, this is E(p) = (Δ + b p₀²) + b p² - 2b p p₀. But this would have a minimum at p = p₀, since dE/dp = 2b p - 2b p₀ = 0 => p = p₀. The second derivative is 2b, so it is indeed a minimum. Therefore, this is the same as the given dispersion E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2, where Δ here is actually Δ + b p₀² from the previous expression. Wait, no, in this case, if we write E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2, expanding gives E(p) = Δ + b p² - 2b p p₀ + b p₀². So the original Δ in the problem is actually Δ = Δ' + b p₀², where Δ' is the minimum energy. But in the problem statement, it says \"starts with a finite value of Δ > 0 at momentum p = p0\", so at p = p₀, E(p₀) = Δ. Therefore, in the expanded form, Δ = Δ + b p₀² - 2b p p₀ + b p₀² evaluated at p = p₀? Wait no, at p = p₀, E(p₀) = Δ + b(p₀ - p₀)^2 = Δ, which matches.\n\nSo the dispersion is correct as given. Therefore, my calculation still holds, and the density of states should not depend on p₀. But since the options include p₀, and when p₀ = 0, option B is correct, perhaps the intended answer is B, assuming that there is a mistake in the problem's options or in the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about the density of states in terms of energy, but in terms of momentum? Let me check.\n\nIf the question were asking for the density of states in terms of momentum, but that seems unlikely since the options have E in them. The options have E - Δ, so they are functions of energy.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the question is about the density of states for the quasiparticle, taking into account the effective mass and other factors. But I don't see how p₀ would come into play.\n\nWait, let's look at option D. If I set p₀ = 0, option D becomes:\n\n[V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ (0 + sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ))² ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\n= [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [ (E - Δ)/b ] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\n= [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * sqrt(E - Δ)/b\n\n= [V/(2π²ħ³)] * sqrt(E - Δ)/(2 b^{3/2})\n\nWhich is the same as option B when p₀ = 0, and matches our result. So both B and D reduce to the correct expression when p₀ = 0. However, for non-zero p₀, they have different terms.\n\nBut according to our calculation, the correct expression should not have p₀. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering a different form of the dispersion, or there is an error in the options.\n\nWait, let me think again about the substitution. When I did the substitution q = p - p₀, I assumed that the entire momentum space is being considered, and the shift doesn't affect the number of states. However, perhaps in reality, the roton branch is only defined for certain ranges of momentum, and the density of states includes contributions from both the roton and phonon branches? But the problem specifies roton-like excitations, so it should be only the roton branch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different definition of the density of states, such as the density of states in terms of the magnitude of p, but integrated over all angles? No, that should still give the same result.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the question is about the density of states for a single direction, but no, the volume V implies 3D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in my part. Let me check the dimensions. Let me check the dimensions of the answer.\n\nThe density of states g(E) has dimensions of [states]/[energy]. Let's check the dimensions of my result and the options.\n\nMy result: g(E) = V * sqrt(E - Δ) / (4 π² ħ³ b^{3/2})\n\nLet's check dimensions. Let me denote [E] = energy, [b] is [energy]/[momentum]^2, since E = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2. Therefore, [b] = [E]/[p]^2 = [mass]/[time]^2 (since [p] = [mass][length]/[time], [p]^2 = [mass]^2[length]^2/[time]^2, [E] = [mass][length]^2/[time]^2, so [b] = [E]/[p]^2 = ([mass][length]^2/[time]^2) / ([mass]^2[length]^2/[time]^2) ) = 1/[mass].\n\nWait, [b] has dimensions of 1/[mass]. Let's confirm:\n\nE(p) has dimensions of energy. (p - p₀)^2 has dimensions of [momentum]^2. So b must have dimensions of [energy]/[momentum]^2 = ([mass][length]^2/[time]^2) / ([mass]^2[length]^2/[time]^2) ) = 1/[mass], yes.\n\nNow, my result: g(E) has dimensions of V * sqrt(E) / ( ħ³ b^{3/2} )\n\nLet's compute:\n\nV has dimensions [length]^3.\n\nsqrt(E) has [energy]^{1/2} = ([mass][length]^2/[time]^2)^{1/2} = [mass]^{1/2}[length]/[time].\n\nDenominator: ħ³ has dimensions ([energy][time])^3 = ([mass][length]^2/[time]^2 * [time]^2)^3 = ([mass][length]^2)^3 = [mass]^3[length]^6. Wait, no:\n\nWait ħ has dimensions of [energy][time] = [mass][length]^2/[time]. Therefore, ħ³ has dimensions [mass]^3[length]^6/[time]^3.\n\nb^{3/2} has dimensions ([mass]^{-1})^{3/2} = [mass]^{-3/2}.\n\nTherefore, overall denominator: [mass]^3[length]^6/[time]^3 * [mass]^{-3/2} = [mass]^{3 - 3/2}[length]^6/[time]^3 = [mass]^{3/2}[length]^6/[time]^3.\n\nNumerator: V * sqrt(E) has [length]^3 * [mass]^{1/2}[length]/[time] = [mass]^{1/2}[length]^4/[time].\n\nTherefore, overall dimensions of g(E) = [mass]^{1/2}[length]^4/[time] / ([mass]^{3/2}[length]^6/[time]^3) ) = [length]^4/[time] * [time]^3 / ([mass]^{1}[length]^6) ) = [time]^2 / ([mass][length]^2).\n\nBut the density of states should have dimensions [states]/[energy]. Since [states] is dimensionless, [g(E)] should be [1/[energy]].\n\nLet me check [time]^2 / ([mass][length]^2). Since [energy] = [mass][length]^2/[time]^2, so [1/[energy]] = [time]^2 / ([mass][length]^2). Yes! So my result has correct dimensions.\n\nNow, let's check option B. Let's take option B:\n\ng(E) = [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [p₀ - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )]^2 / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nLet me check the dimensions. Let's ignore constants for now. The term [p₀ - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )]^2 has dimensions [momentum]^2. Divided by sqrt(E - Δ), which has [energy]^{1/2}. So overall, the term has [momentum]^2 / [energy]^{1/2} = ([mass]^2[length]^2/[time]^2) / ([mass]^{1/2}[length]/[time]) ) = [mass]^{3/2}[length]^1/[time]^1.\n\nMultiply by 1/√b: since [b] is 1/[mass], 1/√b has [mass]^{1/2}. So overall, [mass]^{3/2}[length]/[time] * [mass]^{1/2} = [mass]^2[length]/[time].\n\nMultiply by V / ħ³: [length]^3 / ([mass]^3[length]^6/[time]^3) ) = [time]^3 / ([mass]^3[length]^3). Multiply by [mass]^2[length]/[time] gives [time]^2 / ([mass]^1[length]^2), which is the same as my result. So dimensions are correct. So option B has correct dimensions, as does my result. Similarly for other options.\n\nBut according to my calculation, when p₀ = 0, option B reduces to the correct expression. When p₀ ≠ 0, it introduces additional terms, but according to my derivation, these terms should not be there. This suggests that perhaps there is an error in the problem's options, or perhaps the question assumes a different form of the dispersion.\n\nWait, let me think: if the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p - p₀)^2, then for a given E, there are multiple p's that satisfy this equation. However, in my calculation, I considered the spherical shell in momentum space, which is correct. However, if the question is considering only the magnitude of p, and not the vector, then perhaps there is an additional consideration. For example, if we are to express the density of states as a function of |p|, but no, the question is about energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the density of states in terms of the magnitude of (p - p₀), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let's look at the options again. Let me expand option B:\n\nOption B: [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [p₀ - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )]^2 / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\nLet me expand the numerator:\n\n[p₀ - sqrt( (E - Δ)/b )]^2 = p₀² - 2 p₀ sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) + (E - Δ)/b\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n[V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [p₀² - 2 p₀ sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) + (E - Δ)/b] / sqrt(E - Δ)\n\n= [V/(2π²ħ³)] * [1/(2√b)] * [p₀² / sqrt(E - Δ) - 2 p₀ / sqrt(b) + sqrt( (E - Δ)/b ) / 1 ]\n\nNow, if we compare this to my result, which is [V/(4 π² ħ³ b^{3/2})] * sqrt(E - Δ), let's see if these can be equal.\n\nFor them to be equal, the extra terms must cancel out. But unless p₀ = 0, they don't. Therefore, this suggests that option B is only correct when p₀ = 0, but the problem does not specify that p₀ = 0. However, since the problem gives p₀ as a parameter in the dispersion relation, it must be that the correct answer includes p₀, but according to my derivation, it should not. This contradiction suggests that there might be an error in my derivation.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the density of states in terms of the magnitude of p, not in terms of energy? Let me try that.\n\nIf the question is asking for the density of states as a function of p, then it would be different. But the options have E in them, so it's more likely about energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the density of states for a single direction, but no.\n\nWait, let me think about the physical meaning. The density of states for rotons should depend on how the number of states increases with energy. Since the roton dispersion has a minimum at p₀, as the energy increases from Δ, the number of states increases as the radius of the sphere in momentum space increases. However, since the sphere is centered at p₀, the actual momentum vectors p are spread around p₀. However, the number of states should still depend only on the radius, not on the position of the sphere. Hence, p₀ should not appear. Therefore, I believe my derivation is correct, and the options provided might have errors, or perhaps there is a different interpretation.\n\nGiven that when p₀ = 0, option B gives the correct result, and the other options do not, and since the problem includes p₀ in the dispersion, it's possible that the intended answer is B, assuming that the extra terms somehow cancel out or are considered negligible, or there is a different derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the dispersion is E(p) = Δ + b(p² - p₀²), which would make the minimum at p = 0, but that contradicts the problem statement. Or perhaps there is a typo in the problem.\n\nGiven the options, and the fact that when p₀ = 0, option B reduces to the correct expression, and the other options do not, I think the intended answer is B. Therefore, despite the apparent contradiction, I will go with option B as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
