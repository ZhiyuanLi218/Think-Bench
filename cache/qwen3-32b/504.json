{"question":"A student pushes a puck across a table, moving it from position x = 0 to position x = 0.2 m. After he lets go, the puck continues to travel across the table, coming to rest at position x = 1.2 m. When the puck is at position x = 1.0 m, which of the following is a correct assertion about the net force on the puck? A:The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down. B:The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward. C:The net force is in the positive direction, because the student’s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.

During this phase, the puck is accelerating in the positive x-direction due to the applied force.\n\n2. **After the Push (0.2 m to 1.2 m):**  \n   Once the student lets go of the puck, the only horizontal force acting on it is **friction**, which opposes the motion. The puck continues to move forward (positive x-direction) but **slows down** due to the frictional force until it comes to rest at $ x = 1.2 \\, \\text{m} $.\n\n3. **At $ x = 1.0 \\, \\text{m} $:**  \n   At this point, the puck is still moving in the positive direction but **decelerating**. Deceleration is a **negative acceleration** (opposite to the direction of motion), and by Newton’s Second Law ($ \\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m \\vec{a} $), the **net force** must be in the **negative x-direction** to cause this deceleration.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Answer Choices\n\n- **A: The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.**  \n  ✅ **Correct.** This directly aligns with the physics of the situation: the puck is decelerating in the positive direction, so the net force is in the negative direction.\n\n- **B: The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s² downward.**  \n  ❌ **Incorrect.** While gravity does act downward, the **normal force** from the table counteracts it, resulting in **zero net vertical force**. The question is about **horizontal** motion and **net horizontal force**, so this is irrelevant.\n\n- **C: The net force is in the positive direction, because the student’s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.**  \n  ❌ **Incorrect.** The student is **no longer pushing** the puck at $ x = 1.0 \\, \\text{m} $, so the net force is **not** in the positive direction anymore.\n\n- **D: The net force is zero, because the student’s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.**  \n  ❌ **Incorrect.** The student is not pushing at this point, so the **only horizontal force** is friction, which is **not balanced** — it is **unbalanced**, causing a **non-zero net force**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out this physics problem about a puck moving on a table. Let me start by understanding the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, a student pushes a puck from x=0 to x=0.2 meters. Then, after letting go, the puck keeps moving but eventually stops at x=1.2 meters. The question is asking about the net force on the puck when it's at x=1.0 meters. The options are A, B, C, or D. \n\nLet me recall Newton's laws. Net force relates to acceleration. If there's a net force, the object accelerates in the direction of that force. Also, friction is usually present unless stated otherwise, so even if the student isn't pushing anymore, there's probably friction acting on the puck.\n\nSo the puck is moving from x=0.2 to x=1.2 after the push is released. At x=1.0, which is before the final position, it's still moving towards 1.2. But since it's coming to rest, that means it's decelerating. Deceleration is a negative acceleration (if we consider the direction of motion as positive). So if the puck is slowing down while moving in the positive direction, the acceleration is negative, which means the net force is also negative (since F=ma, direction of F is same as a).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Net force is negative because moving positive but slowing down. That makes sense. If something is moving in one direction and slowing down, the net force is opposite to the motion. So A could be correct.\n\nB: Net force is down due to gravity. Well, gravity is acting downward, but if the puck is on a table, the normal force from the table would balance the gravitational force. So vertically, net force is zero. The net force here is horizontal, so B is probably incorrect.\n\nC: Net force is positive because the student pushed it. But the student isn't pushing anymore once the puck is moving from 0.2 to 1.2. The only horizontal force after the push is friction, which is opposite to the direction of motion. So C is incorrect because the student's push isn't acting anymore.\n\nD: Net force is zero because the push equals friction. But the student isn't pushing at x=1.0. The student only pushed from 0 to 0.2. After that, the only horizontal force is friction. So if there's friction, then net force isn't zero. Unless there's no friction, but the puck is stopping, so friction must be present. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Let me check again.\n\nWhen the puck is moving from 0.2 to 1.2, the student is no longer pushing. So the only horizontal force is friction, which is acting opposite to the direction of motion (which is positive). So friction is negative. Therefore, the net force is negative. The puck is slowing down because the net force is opposite to its velocity. So A is correct. \n\nB is about vertical force, which is balanced, so no net vertical force. The question is about the net force in general, but since the horizontal net force is non-zero, the overall net force is the horizontal component. So A is correct. \n\nYes, I think A is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
