From what I remember, atom economy is a measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction. The ideal scenario is when all the atoms from the reactants are incorporated into the desired product, meaning there's no waste. So the reaction should have 100% atom economy, where all the reactants become the product.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one. \n\nOption A: The reaction of acetylene preparation using calcium carbide and water. The reaction is probably CaC2 + H2O → C2H2 + Ca(OH)2. Wait, so the reactants are calcium carbide and water. The products are acetylene gas and calcium hydroxide. But calcium hydroxide is a byproduct here. That means not all the atoms from the reactants go into the desired product (acetylene). So there's some waste, which would lower the atom economy. So maybe A isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B: Preparing ethylene by heating bromoethane with NaOH in ethanol. That sounds like an elimination reaction. The reaction would be something like CH3CH2Br + NaOH → CH2=CH2 + NaBr + H2O. So the reactants are bromoethane and NaOH. The products are ethylene, sodium bromide, and water. Again, there are byproducts (NaBr and H2O), so not all the atoms from the reactants end up in the desired product (ethylene). So B might not be ideal either.\n\nOption C: Preparing 2,4,6-tribromophenol using phenol and bromine water. The reaction here is phenol reacting with bromine. Phenol (C6H5OH) plus Br2 would form tribromophenol. The reaction would probably produce HBr as a byproduct. For example, each bromine substitution would release a hydrogen as HBr. So if three bromines are added, you might have 3 HBr molecules. So the reactants are phenol and Br2, and the products are tribromophenol and HBr. Since HBr is a byproduct, that means not all atoms are used in the desired product. So atom economy isn't 100% here either. So C might not be the answer.\n\nOption D: Preparing ethylene oxide using ethylene and oxygen under Ag catalysis. Ethylene oxide is a cyclic ether. The reaction is probably 2 C2H4 + O2 → 2 C2H4O, catalyzed by Ag. Let me check the stoichiometry. If you have two moles of ethylene reacting with one mole of oxygen to produce two moles of ethylene oxide. Let's count the atoms. On the left: 4 C, 8 H, 2 O. On the right: 4 C, 8 H, 2 O. Wait, that's balanced. So all the atoms from the reactants (ethylene and oxygen) are converted into the product (ethylene oxide). There are no byproducts. So this reaction would have 100% atom economy because every atom from the reactants ends up in the product. That seems ideal. \n\nLet me double-check each option again. For D, the reaction is direct oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide. If there are no byproducts, then yes, all atoms are used. In contrast, the other options produce byproducts. For example, in A, calcium hydroxide is formed; in B, NaBr and H2O; in C, HBr. Therefore, D is the only one where all atoms from the reactants become part of the desired product. \n\nI think that makes sense. The key is whether there are any byproducts. If a reaction produces only the desired product without any waste, that's the ideal atom economy. So the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
