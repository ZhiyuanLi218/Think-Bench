Then, express that ratio as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. Alright, let me start by recalling what a regular octahedron is. A regular octahedron is a Platonic solid with eight equilateral triangular faces, six vertices, and twelve edges. It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases.\n\nNow, the cube C is formed by connecting the centers of the faces of O. Since O has eight triangular faces, each face center will be a vertex of the cube. Wait, but a cube has eight vertices, so that matches up. Each triangular face's center becomes a vertex of the cube. Interesting. So there's a relationship between the octahedron and the cube here. In fact, I remember that the octahedron and cube are dual polyhedra. That means that the vertices of one correspond to the centers of the faces of the other. So if we take the dual of an octahedron, we get a cube, which is exactly what's happening here. So that checks out.\n\nSo, to find the volume ratio, I need to figure out the volumes of both the octahedron and the cube. But since they are duals, their dimensions are related. However, I need to establish a common reference to compare their volumes. Maybe I should assign a specific edge length to the octahedron and then compute the edge length of the cube based on that. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to model both shapes and compute their volumes.\n\nLet me try coordinates. Coordinates might be a good approach here. Let me recall that a regular octahedron can be represented with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), and (0, 0, ±1). Let me verify that. If we take those six points, each coordinate axis has a vertex at ±1, and the distance between any two adjacent vertices should be the same. For example, the distance between (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0) is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). Similarly, between (1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1), it's also sqrt(2). And between (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) is 2. Wait, but edges of the octahedron are the ones connecting vertices that are adjacent. In this coordinate system, the edges are between each pair of vertices that differ in exactly two coordinates? Wait no. Let me think. Each triangular face is formed by three vertices. For example, (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) form a triangular face. So each edge of the octahedron connects two vertices that differ in two coordinates? No, actually, each edge connects two vertices that are adjacent on the octahedron. Since each vertex is part of several edges.\n\nBut in this coordinate system, each vertex is connected to four others. Wait, no. Let me count. Each vertex is part of four edges? For example, take the vertex (1, 0, 0). It is connected to (0, 1, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, 1), and (0, 0, -1). So yes, four edges. Therefore, each vertex has four edges, which makes sense for an octahedron (each vertex is part of four triangular faces). So edges are between vertices that differ in one coordinate? Wait, (1, 0, 0) to (0, 1, 0) differs in two coordinates. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, actually, if you take the standard coordinates for a regular octahedron as (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1), then the edges are between each pair of vertices that are not antipodal. Wait, no. The antipodal points are like (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0). Each vertex is connected to four others. For example, (1, 0, 0) is connected to (0, 1, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, -1). So each vertex is connected to the four vertices that have a zero in the coordinate where it is non-zero. So, yes, the edges are between vertices that have exactly one non-zero coordinate each, and they are in different axes. Therefore, the edge length between those points is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 + ...] but since only two coordinates are non-zero and they are in different axes, the distance is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Therefore, the edge length of the octahedron in this coordinate system is sqrt(2). Wait, but if we want to have edge length something else, maybe we need to scale it.\n\nBut maybe for simplicity, let me take this octahedron with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), etc., and compute the cube whose vertices are the centers of the faces of this octahedron. Then compute the volumes.\n\nFirst, let me figure out the coordinates of the centers of the faces of the octahedron. Each face is a triangle. For example, take the face with vertices (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1). The center of this face would be the average of the coordinates of the three vertices. So ((1 + 0 + 0)/3, (0 + 1 + 0)/3, (0 + 0 + 1)/3) = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). Similarly, the center of the opposite face, which would be (-1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, -1), would be (-1/3, -1/3, -1/3). Similarly, there are other faces. Let me think how many faces there are.\n\nA regular octahedron has eight triangular faces. Each face corresponds to a combination of positive and negative directions? Wait, no. Let me think. The octahedron with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), etc., has eight triangular faces? Wait, no. Wait, a regular octahedron has eight faces? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, a regular octahedron has eight triangular faces? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, a regular octahedron has eight triangular faces? Let me check. The octahedron has 8 faces, 6 vertices, 12 edges. Yes, that's correct. For example, each of the eight faces corresponds to each combination of positive and negative in some way? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. For each of the eight faces, maybe they are oriented in different directions.\n\nBut in any case, each triangular face is determined by three vertices. For example, the ones I mentioned earlier: (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) is one face. Similarly, there's another face (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, -1); another (1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, 1); another (1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, -1); similarly for (-1, 0, 0)... So there are eight faces in total. Each face corresponds to a choice of sign for each coordinate? Wait, maybe not. Let me count. For each face, two of the coordinates are positive and one is negative? No, maybe not. Wait, actually, each face is adjacent to one of the eight octants. For example, the face (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) is in the all-positive octant. Similarly, there are faces in each of the other octants. But since the octahedron is symmetric, there are eight triangular faces, each lying in a different octant. Therefore, their centers would be in each octant, at coordinates (±1/3, ±1/3, ±1/3). But not all combinations, because each face is in a specific octant. Wait, for example, the face (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) is in the positive octant, so its center is (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). Similarly, the face (-1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, -1) is in the negative octant, with center (-1/3, -1/3, -1/3). Then, there are other faces that have two positive coordinates and one negative? For example, take the face (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, -1). That would be in the octant where x and y are positive, z is negative. Its center would be (1/3, 1/3, -1/3). Similarly, there are faces for each combination of two positive and one negative, and two negative and one positive. Since there are eight faces, and each octant has one face? Wait, no. Wait, there are eight octants, but each face lies in one octant? But each octant is defined by the sign of x, y, z. If the face has vertices with coordinates that are positive or negative, then the face lies in that octant. However, the octahedron has eight triangular faces, each in a different octant? Let me check. For example, the octant where x, y, z are all positive has one face; the octant where x, y positive, z negative has another; similarly for all others. Since there are eight octants, and each octant has one face of the octahedron? Wait, but the octahedron only has eight faces, so yes, each octant has one face.\n\nTherefore, the centers of the faces are at (±1/3, ±1/3, ±1/3). However, not all combinations. Wait, each face center has coordinates with all three components positive, or two positive and one negative, etc. Wait, for example, the face in the octant with x positive, y positive, z negative has center (1/3, 1/3, -1/3). Similarly, for each combination of signs. However, how many different sign combinations are there? For three coordinates, there are 2^3 = 8 combinations. Therefore, the centers of the faces are exactly the eight points (±1/3, ±1/3, ±1/3). Therefore, those eight points are the vertices of the cube C.\n\nSo the cube C has vertices at all points with coordinates (±1/3, ±1/3, ±1/3). Now, what is the edge length of this cube? Let me compute the distance between two adjacent vertices of the cube. For example, take (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) and (-1/3, 1/3, 1/3). Wait, but are those adjacent? Wait, in a cube, two vertices are adjacent if they differ in exactly one coordinate. Let me check. For example, (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) and (-1/3, 1/3, 1/3) differ in the x-coordinate. The distance between them is sqrt[(-1/3 - 1/3)^2 + 0 + 0] = sqrt[(-2/3)^2] = 2/3. However, in a cube, the edge length is the distance between adjacent vertices. So if that distance is 2/3, then the edge length of the cube is 2/3. However, let me check another pair. Take (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) and (1/3, -1/3, 1/3). Similarly, distance is 2/3. And (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) and (1/3, 1/3, -1/3) is also 2/3. Therefore, yes, the edge length of the cube is 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the cube C has edge length 2/3. Then, its volume is (2/3)^3 = 8/27.\n\nNow, what is the volume of the octahedron O? Let me recall that in our coordinate system, the octahedron has vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1). How do I compute its volume?\n\nOne way to compute the volume of a regular octahedron is to note that it can be split into two square pyramids with a square base. The base is a square in the plane z = 0, with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0). Wait, actually, if we consider the octahedron as two square pyramids glued at their square bases, then each pyramid has a square base and four triangular faces.\n\nBut in our case, the octahedron's vertices are at (±1, 0, 0), etc. So if we split it into two square pyramids, the base would be the square connecting (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (-1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0) in the plane z = 0? Wait, no. Wait, actually, if you take all the points with z = 0, the intersection with the octahedron is the square connecting (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (-1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0). But actually, connecting those points would form a square rotated 45 degrees relative to the axes. The side length of that square can be computed. The distance between (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0) is sqrt(2), so the edges of the square are sqrt(2), and the area of the square would be (sqrt(2))^2 = 2? Wait, no. Wait, if the square is rotated, the side length is sqrt(2), but the area is actually (diagonal^2)/2. Wait, the diagonal of the square would be the distance between (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0), which is 2. Therefore, if the diagonal is 2, then the area is (diagonal^2)/2 = 4/2 = 2. So the area of the base is 2. Then, the height of each pyramid is the distance from the apex to the base. The apex of the upper pyramid is at (0, 0, 1), and the base is in the plane z = 0. Therefore, the height is 1. Therefore, the volume of one pyramid is (1/3)*base_area*height = (1/3)*2*1 = 2/3. Since there are two pyramids, the total volume of the octahedron is 2*(2/3) = 4/3.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the octahedron O is 4/3, and the volume of the cube C is 8/27. Therefore, the ratio of the volume of O to that of C is (4/3) / (8/27) = (4/3)*(27/8) = (4*27)/(3*8) = (108)/24 = 9/2. Wait, 108 divided by 24 is 9/2? Let me check: 24*4 = 96, 24*4.5 = 108. Yes, so 108/24 = 9/2. Therefore, the ratio is 9/2, so m = 9, n = 2, which are coprime, so m + n = 11. But wait, let me check my calculations again because 9/2 seems a bit high. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, volume of octahedron: split into two square pyramids. Each pyramid has a square base with area 2 and height 1. Volume of each pyramid is 1/3 * 2 * 1 = 2/3. Total volume 4/3. Correct. Then the cube volume: edge length 2/3, so (2/3)^3 = 8/27. Then ratio O/C is (4/3) / (8/27) = (4/3)*(27/8) = (4*27)/(3*8) = (4/8)*(27/3) = (1/2)*9 = 9/2. Yes, that's correct. 9/2 is reduced, so m + n = 11. Hmm. But let me think again if I considered the correct octahedron and cube.\n\nWait, but in this coordinate system, the octahedron has vertices at distance 1 from the origin, but is that the regular octahedron? Yes, because all edges are of equal length. Wait, earlier we saw that the edges between adjacent vertices are sqrt(2). For example, between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0). So in this coordinate system, the edge length of the octahedron is sqrt(2). But if we want to check the cube's edge length is 2/3, and the octahedron's volume is 4/3. But maybe I need to check if there's another way to compute the octahedron's volume?\n\nAlternatively, there is a formula for the volume of a regular octahedron. Let me recall. For a regular octahedron with edge length a, the volume is (sqrt(2)/3) * a^3. Let me check that. If that's the case, then let's compute the edge length in our coordinate system. As we saw, the edge length a is sqrt(2). Then volume would be (sqrt(2)/3)*(sqrt(2))^3. Let's compute that: (sqrt(2)/3)*(2*sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2)*2*sqrt(2))/3 = (2*2)/3 = 4/3. Which matches our previous calculation. So that's correct. Therefore, the volume of the octahedron is indeed 4/3.\n\nThen the cube has volume 8/27, so the ratio is 9/2. Therefore, the answer is 9 + 2 = 11. However, I need to make sure that the cube is correctly defined. The cube has vertices at (±1/3, ±1/3, ±1/3). Let me confirm that those points form a cube. For a cube, all edges must be equal, and all angles 90 degrees. Since we computed the edge length as 2/3 by taking the distance between points differing in one coordinate, which is correct. Also, the cube is axis-aligned? Yes, because its vertices have coordinates with each component ±1/3. So the cube is axis-aligned with edges parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, its edge length is 2/3, volume is (2/3)^3 = 8/27. Correct.\n\nBut let me think again if the centers of the faces of the octahedron are indeed those points. Take a face of the octahedron, say, the one with vertices (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1). The centroid is indeed (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). Similarly, other centroids are obtained by averaging the coordinates. Therefore, yes, the centers of the faces are those eight points. Therefore, the cube C has those eight points as vertices. Therefore, the calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9/2, so m + n = 11. But wait, let me check again because sometimes with dual polyhedra, there might be scaling factors I haven't considered. Let me check if the edge length of the octahedron is sqrt(2) as in our coordinates, and the cube has edge length 2/3. But maybe the problem didn't specify the size of the octahedron, so we can choose a convenient size, which we did. Since we can scale the octahedron as needed, and since we are taking a ratio, the ratio should be independent of scaling. Therefore, our calculation is valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should do the calculation with a different normalization. Suppose I take the octahedron with edge length 1, then compute the cube's volume and then take the ratio. Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a regular octahedron with edge length a, the volume is (sqrt(2)/3) * a^3. So if we take a = 1, then volume is sqrt(2)/3. Now, we need to find the volume of the cube whose vertices are the centers of the faces of this octahedron.\n\nBut to find the cube's edge length, we need to find the distance between centers of adjacent faces. However, this requires knowing the positions of the face centers in terms of the octahedron's geometry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate the edge length of the octahedron to the edge length of the cube. Let me try to find the relationship.\n\nIn our previous coordinate system, the octahedron had edge length sqrt(2) and the cube had edge length 2/3. Therefore, if we want to find the ratio for a general octahedron, we can use scaling. Suppose we scale the octahedron so that its edge length is 1. The original octahedron had edge length sqrt(2), so we need to scale it down by a factor of 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the cube's edge length would also scale by the same factor. Therefore, original cube edge length was 2/3, scaled down by 1/sqrt(2), giving 2/(3*sqrt(2)).\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cube would be [2/(3*sqrt(2))]^3 = 8 / [27*(2*sqrt(2))] = 8 / [54*sqrt(2)] = 4 / [27*sqrt(2)].\n\nMeanwhile, the volume of the octahedron with edge length 1 is sqrt(2)/3. Therefore, the ratio O/C is [sqrt(2)/3] / [4/(27*sqrt(2))] = [sqrt(2)/3] * [27*sqrt(2)/4] = [ (2)/3 ] * [27/4 ] = (54)/12 = 9/2. Same result! Therefore, regardless of scaling, the ratio is 9/2. Therefore, the answer is 9 + 2 = 11. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\nBut let me think again if there's another way someone might approach this problem and perhaps get confused. For example, someone might think that the dual of the octahedron is the cube, but might miscalculate the positions of the face centers. But in our case, we did that by coordinates and verified. Alternatively, someone might think that the edge length of the cube relates to the octahedron's inradius or circumradius.\n\nLet me check that approach. The centers of the faces of the octahedron are the vertices of the cube. The position of each face center is also the centroid of the face. For a regular octahedron, the distance from the center of the octahedron to the center of a face is called the midradius. Maybe if I compute that, and then relate it to the cube's edge length.\n\nThe midradius of a regular octahedron is the radius of the sphere that touches the midpoints of the edges. Wait, no, the midradius is the radius of the sphere that touches the centers of the faces. Wait, different terms. Let me recall. For Platonic solids, there are several radii: circumradius (distance from center to vertices), midradius (distance from center to edges), and inradius (distance from center to faces).\n\nIn our case, the centers of the faces of the octahedron are at a distance equal to the inradius of the octahedron. Then, since those centers form a cube, the inradius of the octahedron is equal to half the space diagonal of the cube? Wait, no. Wait, the centers of the faces are the vertices of the cube. Therefore, the distance from the center of the octahedron (which is also the center of the cube) to each vertex of the cube is equal to the inradius of the octahedron. For a cube with edge length a, the distance from the center to a vertex is (a/2)*sqrt(3). Therefore, if we let R_oct_in = (a_cube / 2)*sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the inradius of the octahedron, then I can find the edge length of the cube.\n\nLet me compute the inradius of a regular octahedron. The formula for the inradius (radius of the inscribed sphere, tangent to the faces) of a regular octahedron with edge length a is r = (a * sqrt(6)) / 6. Let me verify that. For a regular octahedron with edge length a, the inradius can be calculated based on the volume and the surface area. The formula is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the surface area.\n\nGiven that for a regular octahedron with edge length a, volume V = (sqrt(2)/3) * a^3, and surface area A = 2 * sqrt(3) * a^2 (since it has 8 triangular faces, each with area (sqrt(3)/4)*a^2, so 8*(sqrt(3)/4)*a^2 = 2*sqrt(3)*a^2). Therefore, r = 3V / A = 3*(sqrt(2)/3 * a^3) / (2*sqrt(3)*a^2) ) = (sqrt(2)*a) / (2*sqrt(3)) ) = a * sqrt(2) / (2*sqrt(3)) ) = a * sqrt(6)/6. Yes, because sqrt(2)/sqrt(3) is sqrt(6)/3, so times 1/2 is sqrt(6)/6. Therefore, r = a * sqrt(6)/6.\n\nTherefore, the inradius of the octahedron is r_oct_in = a * sqrt(6)/6. On the other hand, for the cube whose vertices are these face centers, the distance from the center to a vertex is (a_cube / 2) * sqrt(3). Therefore, equating these two:\n\nr_oct_in = (a_cube / 2) * sqrt(3)\n\n=> a * sqrt(6)/6 = (a_cube / 2) * sqrt(3)\n\nSolving for a_cube:\n\na_cube = [a * sqrt(6)/6] / [sqrt(3)/2] = [a * sqrt(6) / 6] * [2 / sqrt(3)] = [a * 2 * sqrt(6) ] / [6 * sqrt(3)] = [a * sqrt(6) ] / [3 * sqrt(3)] = [a * sqrt(2) ] / 3.\n\nTherefore, a_cube = a * sqrt(2)/3.\n\nTherefore, if we know the edge length of the octahedron, we can find the edge length of the cube. Therefore, if we take the octahedron with edge length a, then the cube has edge length (a * sqrt(2))/3. Therefore, the volume of the cube is [ (a * sqrt(2))/3 ]^3 = (a^3 * 2*sqrt(2))/27.\n\nMeanwhile, the volume of the octahedron is V_oct = (sqrt(2)/3) * a^3. Therefore, the ratio V_oct / V_cube is [ (sqrt(2)/3) * a^3 ] / [ (2*sqrt(2)/27) * a^3 ] = (sqrt(2)/3) / (2*sqrt(2)/27) ) = (sqrt(2)/3) * (27 / (2*sqrt(2))) ) = (27)/(3*2) = 9/2. Same result! Therefore, regardless of the method, the ratio is 9/2. Therefore, the answer is 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. However, let me check once more with actual numbers. In our coordinate system, octahedron has edge length sqrt(2), cube has edge length 2/3. According to the formula above, a_cube = a_oct * sqrt(2)/3. Let's check: a_oct is sqrt(2). Then a_cube should be sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/3 = 2/3. Correct. Therefore, that's consistent. Therefore, the volume ratio is 9/2. Therefore, m + n is 11.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's any chance I mixed up the duals or something. For example, maybe the centers of the faces of the octahedron form a cube, but maybe scaled differently? But according to coordinates, they do form a cube with edge length 2/3 when octahedron has vertices at (±1, 0, 0), etc. And calculations confirm that. Therefore, I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that the cube is inscribed in the octahedron or vice versa, but in this case, the cube is derived from the octahedron's face centers, so their sizes are directly related as we calculated.\n\nTherefore, I think I can be confident the answer is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>"}
