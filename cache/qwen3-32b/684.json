Let me start by recalling what I know about phosphoric acid and pH calculations.\n\nFirst, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. However, each dissociation step has a different Ka value. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ⇌ H2PO4^- + H+, the second is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka values decrease with each step, so the first dissociation is the most significant contributor to H+ concentration, followed by the second, and the third is negligible in most cases.\n\nGiven that the pH is 2, that means the concentration of H+ ions is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M. Wait, but the question is about the number of H+ ions in one liter. So, if [H+] is 0.01 M, then in one liter, the moles would be 0.01 mol, and the number of ions would be 0.01 * NA. But option A says 0.02 NA. Hmm, so that seems incorrect. Unless there's something else contributing H+ ions. But wait, in a solution, the H+ comes from both the dissociation of the acid and water autoionization. However, at pH 2, the contribution from water autoionization is negligible because [H+] is already 0.01 M. So the total H+ concentration should be approximately 0.01 M. Therefore, option A is saying 0.02 NA, which would correspond to 0.02 M. That's double what it should be. So A is probably incorrect. Let me note that.\n\nNow, moving to option B. It states a charge balance equation: [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-]. Let me recall that in any solution, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges. For phosphoric acid, the species are H3PO4 (neutral), H2PO4^- (charge -1), HPO4^2- (charge -2), PO4^3- (charge -3). Also, there are H+ and OH^- from water.\n\nSo the charge balance equation should account for all charges. The positive charges are from H+ and any cations, but since we're dealing with H3PO4 alone, the only cation is H+. The negative charges come from the anions: H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and OH^-.\n\nSo the charge balance equation would be:\n\n[H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-]\n\nWhich is exactly what option B says. So B should be correct. Wait, but let me check again. Each H2PO4^- contributes -1, so multiplied by 1, HPO4^2- contributes -2, so multiplied by 2, etc. Yes, so the coefficients are correct. Therefore, B is correct. So B is a correct statement.\n\nOption C: Diluting with water increases the degree of ionization, and the solution pH decreases. Hmm. Let's think. For a weak acid, when you dilute it, the degree of ionization increases because Le Chatelier's principle says that the system will shift to produce more ions to counteract the dilution. However, the pH might not necessarily decrease. Wait, pH is related to [H+]. When you dilute an acid, even if the degree of ionization increases, the overall concentration of H+ might decrease because the solution is more dilute. Let's take an example. Suppose you have a weak acid HA with initial concentration c. The degree of ionization α increases when you dilute, but [H+] is α * c. If you dilute the solution, c decreases, and α increases. However, the product α * c might decrease or increase depending on how much each changes. For a weak acid, the [H+] is roughly sqrt(Ka * c) when it's not too dilute. So if you dilute, c decreases, so sqrt(Ka * c) decreases, meaning [H+] decreases, so pH increases. Wait, so if pH increases, that means the solution becomes less acidic. But the statement says that pH decreases. So that would be incorrect. Therefore, option C is incorrect because diluting would increase pH, not decrease it. However, the first part of the statement says the degree of ionization increases, which is correct. But the second part about pH decreasing is wrong. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: Adding NaH2PO4 solid enhances the acidity of the solution. NaH2PO4 is the sodium salt of H2PO4^-. When dissolved in water, it dissociates into Na+ and H2PO4^-. Now, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 and the conjugate acid of HPO4^2-. Adding H2PO4^- would affect the equilibrium. Let me think about the equilibria in the solution. The original solution has H3PO4 dissociating into H2PO4^- and H+. Adding more H2PO4^- would shift the equilibrium according to Le Chatelier's principle. Let me consider the first dissociation: H3PO4 ⇌ H2PO4^- + H+. If we add H2PO4^-, the system would shift to the left, decreasing the concentration of H+? Wait, but that would decrease acidity. However, maybe there's another perspective. Alternatively, H2PO4^- can also act as an acid itself, dissociating into HPO4^2- and H+. So adding more H2PO4^- could increase the source of H+ ions. But which effect dominates?\n\nActually, the overall effect depends on the position of the equilibrium. Since NaH2PO4 is a salt that provides H2PO4^-, which is an amphoteric species. In solution, the pH would depend on the balance between the dissociation of H2PO4^- and its ability to accept protons. However, in the presence of H3PO4, adding H2PO4^- would act as a common ion, suppressing the dissociation of H3PO4. But since H2PO4^- can also donate H+ (as the first dissociation is already considered), perhaps adding it would increase the concentration of H2PO4^-, which can then donate more H+? Wait, no. If you add H2PO4^-, you're increasing the concentration of that species. Let me think about the equilibria:\n\nOriginal solution: H3PO4 ⇌ H2PO4^- + H+ (K1)\n\nAdding NaH2PO4 increases [H2PO4^-], so according to Le Chatelier, the first equilibrium would shift left, decreasing [H+]. Therefore, the acidity (H+ concentration) would decrease. However, the question says that adding NaH2PO4 enhances acidity. So this would be incorrect. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Suppose the solution is already at pH 2. If you add H2PO4^-, which is a weaker acid than H3PO4? Wait, H3PO4 is a stronger acid than H2PO4^-. Adding H2PO4^- would add a species that can donate H+ (but less than H3PO4). However, if the solution is already at pH 2, which is quite acidic, maybe adding H2PO4^- doesn't contribute much H+? Or maybe the presence of more H2PO4^- allows for more H+? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the buffer solution? If you have H3PO4 and H2PO4^-, that's a buffer system. Adding NaH2PO4 would create a buffer, which resists pH changes. But does it make the solution more acidic? If the original solution is just H3PO4, adding its conjugate base would make it a buffer. Depending on the ratio, the pH would be around pKa1. The pKa1 of H3PO4 is around 2.1, so if the original solution is pH 2, which is slightly below pKa1, adding H2PO4^- would bring the pH closer to pKa1, which is 2.1. So pH would increase slightly. Therefore, the solution becomes less acidic. Therefore, adding NaH2PO4 would not enhance acidity; it would reduce it. Hence, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nA: Incorrect. The number of H+ is 0.01 NA, not 0.02 NA.\n\nB: Correct. Charge balance equation.\n\nC: Incorrect. Dilution increases degree of ionization (correct part), but pH increases, not decreases.\n\nD: Incorrect. Adding NaH2PO4 would decrease acidity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. For option A, is there any other source of H+? The problem states pH=2, so regardless of the origin of H+ (from H3PO4 dissociation, or from water?), the measured [H+] is 1e-2 M. Therefore, in one liter, moles of H+ is 0.01 mol, so number is 0.01 NA. So A is wrong. Correct.\n\nFor option B, the charge balance equation is indeed correct. The charges must balance. The left side is [H+] and [Na+] if any, but since there's no Na+ in the original solution, only H+ and OH-. The right side is the sum of anions multiplied by their charges. So B is correct.\n\nC: When diluting, the degree of ionization increases, but pH increases. So the statement says pH decreases, which is wrong. So C is incorrect.\n\nD: Adding NaH2PO4 would add H2PO4^- which is a weaker acid than H3PO4. But since the solution is already at pH 2, which is below pKa1 (~2.1), adding H2PO4^- would shift the equilibrium. Let me think in terms of buffer solution. The pH of a buffer is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, if we add H2PO4^- (base) to H3PO4 (acid), the pH would be pKa1 + log([H2PO4^-]/[H3PO4]). If originally, the solution is just H3PO4, then [H2PO4^-] is low. Adding H2PO4^- would increase the ratio, so pH would increase. Therefore, the solution becomes less acidic. Hence, D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
