The problem is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one (which is acetone, I think) reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are combinations of A and B with different reagents.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what kind of reactions these might be. For the first reaction, butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN is a cyanide ion. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, that's typically a nucleophilic addition reaction. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure: butan-2-one is CH3COCH2CH3. Adding CN- would form a hydroxynitrile. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that out. The parent chain is butanenitrile, so four carbons with the nitrile on the first carbon. The substituents are 2-hydroxy and 2-methyl. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2(OH)C(CN)(CH3)CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I need to draw it. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. Normally, a cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)CN. For acetone (CH3COCH3), adding CN- would give CH2(OH)C(CN)(CH3)2? Wait, but butan-2-one is CH3COCH2CH3, so adding CN- would give CH2(OH)C(CN)(CH2CH3)CH3? Wait, maybe I need to look at the product's name again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The nitrile is on the first carbon, and the hydroxy and methyl are on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(CN)C(OH)(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me parse the name again. The parent chain is butanenitrile (four carbons, nitrile at the end). The substituents are 2-hydroxy and 2-methyl. So the structure would be CH2CH(OH)CH(CH3)CN? Wait, that doesn't fit. Let me think again. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN (four carbons, nitrile at the first carbon). So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would mean the second carbon has both a hydroxy group and a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2(CN)C(OH)(CH3)CH2? Wait, but that would be a five-carbon chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is CH3COCH2CH3. Adding NaCN would lead to a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN (or NaCN in acidic conditions) to form a hydroxynitrile. The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one has four carbons. Adding a nitrile would make it five carbons? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is four carbons with a ketone on carbon 2. Adding a nitrile would add a carbon, making it five. But the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, maybe the product is actually a different structure. Let me check: butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the first carbon, and the second carbon has a hydroxy and a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2(CN)C(OH)(CH3)CH2? That seems like five carbons. Wait, maybe the product is a five-carbon chain. But the name says butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Let me think again. The starting material is butan-2-one (CH3COCH2CH3). Adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. The reaction would be CH3COCH2CH3 + HCN → CH2(OH)C(CN)(CH2CH3)CH3? Wait, that would be CH2(OH)C(CN)(CH2CH3)CH3? Let me count the carbons. The original ketone has four carbons. Adding HCN adds one carbon (the nitrile), so the product should have five carbons. But the product is called butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the product name is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me check the product name again. It's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The nitrile is on the first carbon, and the hydroxy and methyl are on the second. So the structure would be CH2(CN)C(OH)(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. But butanenitrile is four. Maybe the product is actually a different compound. Alternatively, maybe the starting ketone is different. Wait, butan-2-one is CH3COCH2CH3. Adding a nitrile would give a hydroxynitrile. Let me think of the reaction mechanism. The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, protonation gives the hydroxynitrile. The product would be CH2(OH)C(CN)(CH2CH3)CH3? That's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile? Wait, let's count the carbons. The original ketone has four carbons. The product has a nitrile group. If the product is butanenitrile, that's four carbons. But adding a nitrile would add a carbon. So perhaps the product is actually a different structure. Maybe the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Let me check. Propanenitrile is CH2CH2CN. If there's a hydroxy and methyl on the second carbon, that would be CH2(CN)C(OH)(CH3)2? That's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, which is four carbons. But the starting material is butan-2-one (four carbons). So adding HCN would give a five-carbon product. Hmm, this is conflicting. Maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the product name is a typo, and it should be pentanenitrile. But assuming the product name is correct, maybe the reaction is different. Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple cyanohydrin formation. Let me think about the reagents. The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. NaCN is a nucleophile. In acidic conditions, HCN is formed. But if NaCN is used with another reagent A, what could that be? For cyanohydrin formation, typically H2O is used, but sometimes other proton sources. Wait, but the options for A are NaHSO3, H3O+, etc. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Sodium bisulfite is often used to form sulfonic acid derivatives, but in some cases, it can act as a proton source. Alternatively, maybe the reaction requires an acidic workup to protonate the intermediate. So perhaps A is H3O+ or CH3COOH. But the options for A are given as either NaHSO3 or H3O+.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH\n\nB: A = H3O+, B = HCl\n\nC: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl\n\nD: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH\n\nSo for the first reaction, A is either NaHSO3 or H3O+. Let me think about what role A plays. In the formation of cyanohydrins, typically you need HCN. If you use NaCN, you need to provide a proton source. So if A is H3O+ or an acid like CH3COOH, that would protonate the cyanide to form HCN. Alternatively, NaHSO3 might act as a proton source? Not sure. Wait, sodium bisulfite is a weak acid. It can donate a proton. But in some reactions, it's used to form sulfonate esters, but I'm not sure here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a cyanohydrin formation but something else. Wait, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxy group. Another possibility is that the reaction is a nucleophilic addition followed by some other step. But I'm not sure. Let me check the product again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. If the starting ketone is butan-2-one, which is CH3COCH2CH3. Adding a nitrile would give a structure where the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxy group. Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone, followed by some protonation. So the reaction would be: butan-2-one + NaCN + H+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So in this case, the reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ or CH3COOH. So options B, C, D have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3. If A is H3O+, then options B or D. If A is NaHSO3, then options A or C. But why would NaHSO3 be used here? I'm not sure. Maybe NaHSO3 is acting as a proton source? Or perhaps it's part of another reaction. Wait, sodium bisulfite is often used to form sulfonic acid derivatives, but in this case, it's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bisulfite addition to the ketone first, but that would form a bisulfite adduct. But the product here is a nitrile. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a two-step process where NaCN is used with a proton source. So I think A is an acid, either H3O+ or CH3COOH. So options B, C, D for A. Now, looking at the options, the answer choices for A are either NaHSO3 or H3O+. So if A is H3O+, then the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid to protonate the cyanide. So that would be options B or D. Now, moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The reagent B is in the presence of water. The transformation here is from a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides, then to carboxylic acids. But complete hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually requires strong acid or base. The options for B are CH3COOH, HCl, etc. So if B is HCl, that's a strong acid, which would facilitate the hydrolysis. If B is CH3COOH, that's a weaker acid. However, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is more efficient with stronger acids. So perhaps B is HCl. Therefore, for the second reaction, B is HCl. So looking at the options, the correct combination would be where A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3 and B is HCl or CH3COOH. Let me recap: For the first reaction, A is likely an acid (H3O+ or CH3COOH) to protonate the cyanide. For the second reaction, B is a strong acid like HCl to hydrolyze the nitrile to carboxylic acid. So looking at the options: Option B: A = H3O+, B = HCl. Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. Option D: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. If A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that's option B. If A is NaHSO3 and B is HCl, that's option C. But earlier I thought A should be an acid. So why would A be NaHSO3? Unless there's a specific reason. Wait, maybe in some cases, sodium bisulfite is used to protonate the cyanide. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a bisulfite addition to the ketone, but that would form a bisulfite adduct, not a nitrile. So maybe that's not the case. Let me think again about the first reaction. The product is a hydroxynitrile, which is formed by the addition of HCN to the ketone. So if we have NaCN, we need a proton source to form HCN. So the proton source could be H3O+ or a weaker acid like CH3COOH. However, in some cases, sodium bisulfite might be used as a proton source. Wait, sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) can release H+ in solution. So if A is NaHSO3, then in the reaction, it would provide H+ to convert CN- to HCN. But I'm not sure if that's a common practice. Typically, HCl or H2SO4 is used. But in the options given, the possible acids for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. If the correct answer is A = H3O+, then the first part is H3O+. For the second reaction, hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid with HCl. So option B would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Option C is A = NaHSO3 and B = HCl. If A is NaHSO3, maybe it's acting as a proton source. But I'm not sure if that's standard. Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is a different mechanism. Wait, another possibility: the reaction of a ketone with NaCN and NaHSO3. Sodium bisulfite can add to the ketone first, forming a bisulfite adduct, but then with NaCN, maybe it's a different pathway. But I'm not sure. I think the standard reaction is that NaCN in acidic conditions forms HCN, which adds to the ketone. So if A is an acid, then the correct options for A would be H3O+ or CH3COOH. Given that, let's look at the options. If A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that's option B. If A is H3O+ and B is CH3COOH, that's option D. But for the second reaction, hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid with water and B. The hydrolysis is typically done with strong acid or base. For example, in acidic conditions (like HCl), the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid. If B is HCl, then option B or C. If B is CH3COOH, which is a weaker acid, maybe it's not sufficient. So likely B is HCl. Therefore, the correct answer would be option B: A = H3O+, B = HCl. But wait, let me check the options again. Option B says A = H3O+, B = HCl. Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. So if A is H3O+, then B is HCl. So option B. But what if the first reaction requires a milder acid? For example, if the reaction is done in a buffer solution, maybe acetic acid is used. But the product is a cyanohydrin, which is usually formed with a proton source. So if A is CH3COOH, then maybe that's also possible. But in the options, the choices for B in the second reaction are H2O with B being either CH3COOH or HCl. Wait, the second reaction is in the presence of B (H2O), so B is the reagent added with water. So for the second reaction, the hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid. The hydrolysis can be done with aqueous acid (like HCl) or base. But since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's likely done under acidic conditions. So B is HCl. Therefore, the second part is B = HCl. Then, for the first part, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. If A is H3O+, then option B or D. If A is NaHSO3, then option A or C. But why would A be NaHSO3? I'm not sure. Maybe there's a specific reason. For example, sometimes sodium bisulfite is used to generate HCN from NaCN in a controlled manner. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is a different type of addition. Let me think again: butan-2-one (ketone) + NaCN + A → hydroxynitrile. The standard reaction is with HCN. So if you have NaCN, you need a proton source to make HCN. The proton source could be H3O+ (like HCl) or a weaker acid like CH3COOH. But in the options, the possible acids for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. If the correct answer is H3O+, then option B. If it's NaHSO3, then option C. I need to recall if sodium bisulfite is used in such reactions. I think sodium bisulfite is more commonly used to form sulfonic acid derivatives or to protonate certain species. For example, in the case of adding to aldehydes/ketones to form bisulfite adducts, but that's a different reaction. In this case, the product is a hydroxynitrile, not a bisulfite adduct. Therefore, I think the correct reagent A is an acid to protonate the cyanide, making HCN. So A is H3O+ or CH3COOH. Between the options, the possible acids for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Since H3O+ is a stronger acid than NaHSO3, it would be more effective in protonating CN- to form HCN. Therefore, A is likely H3O+. So for the first reaction, A = H3O+, and for the second reaction, B = HCl. Therefore, the correct option is B: A = H3O+, B = HCl. But wait, let me check the options again. Option B is A = H3O+, B = HCl. Yes. So that's option B. Therefore, the answer should be option B.\n</think>"}
