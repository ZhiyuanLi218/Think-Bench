The problem mentions that the disk has an axially symmetric electric quadrupole moment, which has already been determined. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic concepts.\n\nFirst, electric potential due to a charge distribution is generally given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r'})}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r'}|} d^3r'\n$$\n\nBut since we're dealing with a disk, which is a two-dimensional charge distribution, I should probably use surface charge density σ instead of volume charge density ρ. So, the formula becomes:\n\n$$\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\sigma(\\mathbf{r'})}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r'}|} da'\n$$\n\nBut the problem states that the point is distant. So, I need to consider the multipole expansion of the potential. For distant points, the potential can be approximated by the monopole term, dipole term, quadrupole term, and so on. Since the problem mentions that the quadrupole moment is axially symmetric and has been determined, maybe the monopole and dipole terms are zero or need to be considered?\n\nWait, the disk has a total charge Q, so the monopole term should be non-zero. However, if the charge distribution is symmetric about the axis, then maybe the dipole moment is zero? Because for axial symmetry, any dipole moment would have to be along the axis, but if the charge distribution is symmetric around the axis, the dipole moments might cancel out. Let me think. For a dipole moment, it's given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{p} = \\int \\mathbf{r'} \\sigma(\\mathbf{r'}) da'\n$$\n\nBut if the disk is axially symmetric, then integrating over the angular coordinate would make the dipole moment zero. Because for every point on the disk, there's a symmetric point that cancels the dipole contribution. Therefore, the dipole term is zero. So the leading terms would be monopole and quadrupole.\n\nBut the problem says the quadrupole moment is known. So maybe we need to compute the potential up to the quadrupole term?\n\nSo, the general multipole expansion of the potential is:\n\n$$\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{Q}{r} + \\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,j} \\frac{Q_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j}{r^3} + \\cdots \\right]\n$$\n\nSince the dipole term is zero, we can ignore the second term. The quadrupole term involves the quadrupole moment tensor Q_{kj}. However, the problem states that the quadrupole moment is axially symmetric. So, maybe we can express the quadrupole term in a simpler form?\n\nFor an axially symmetric charge distribution, the quadrupole moment tensor can be diagonalized in the coordinate system aligned with the axis of symmetry. Let me recall that for axial symmetry, the quadrupole moment tensor has components such that Q_{zz} is different from Q_{xx} and Q_{yy}, but Q_{xx} = Q_{yy}. Also, all off-diagonal terms are zero.\n\nMoreover, the trace of the quadrupole moment tensor is zero. The trace is Q_{xx} + Q_{yy} + Q_{zz} = 0. Therefore, if Q_{xx} = Q_{yy} = q, then 2q + Q_{zz} = 0, so Q_{zz} = -2q.\n\nBut how does this help me? Well, when calculating the potential, the quadrupole term involves the contraction of the quadrupole tensor with the direction vector. So, for a point at position r, which we can take to be along the z-axis due to axial symmetry (since the quadrupole moment is axially symmetric, the potential should depend on the angle θ between the position vector and the axis). Wait, but the problem says \"a distant point,\" but doesn't specify the direction. However, since the quadrupole moment is axially symmetric, the potential should depend on θ.\n\nBut let me think again. The quadrupole term for a general quadrupole moment tensor is:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{quad} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,j} \\frac{Q_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j}{r^3}\n$$\n\nBut if the quadrupole moment is axially symmetric, then in spherical coordinates, we can express this contraction in terms of θ. Let me recall that for a quadrupole moment aligned along the z-axis, the potential at a point along the axis is different from that off the axis. But in general, for a point at angle θ, the contraction would involve terms like 3 cos²θ - 1 or something similar.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the quadrupole potential. For a quadrupole moment Q, the potential is given by:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{quad} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{4r^3} (3\\cos^2\\theta - 1)\n$$\n\nBut I need to verify this. Let me recall that the quadrupole term in multipole expansion for an axially symmetric case is usually expressed in terms of the Legendre polynomial P₂(cosθ) = (3cos²θ - 1)/2. Therefore, the potential would be proportional to P₂(cosθ)/r³.\n\nBut let me derive this properly. Suppose that the quadrupole tensor is diagonal with Q_xx = Q_yy = q and Q_zz = -2q. Then, for a point with direction given by unit vector (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), the contraction Q_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j would be:\n\nQ_xx sin²θ cos²φ + Q_yy sin²θ sin²φ + Q_zz cos²θ\n\n= q sin²θ (cos²φ + sin²φ) + (-2q) cos²θ\n\n= q sin²θ - 2q cos²θ\n\n= q (sin²θ - 2 cos²θ)\n\nBut since sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ, substituting:\n\nq (1 - cos²θ - 2 cos²θ) = q (1 - 3 cos²θ)\n\nTherefore, the quadrupole term becomes:\n\n(1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * [q (1 - 3 cos²θ)] / r³\n\nBut wait, the quadrupole tensor components are related to the actual quadrupole moment. However, there might be different definitions. Let me check.\n\nThe electric quadrupole moment tensor is defined as:\n\n$$\nQ_{kj} = \\int \\left( 3r'_k r'_j - r'^2 \\delta_{kj} \\right) \\rho(\\mathbf{r'}) d^3r'\n$$\n\nBut for a surface charge, this would be:\n\n$$\nQ_{kj} = \\int \\left( 3r'_k r'_j - r'^2 \\delta_{kj} \\right) \\sigma(\\mathbf{r'}) da'\n$$\n\nBut for axial symmetry, we can compute the quadrupole moment. However, the problem states that the quadrupole moment has been previously determined. So maybe I don't need to compute it from scratch? Wait, but the problem says \"Find the electric potential distribution...\". So maybe I need to express the potential in terms of the given quadrupole moment?\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify what the quadrupole moment is. Wait, maybe I need to compute it first? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem states: \"For a circular disk with radius a, it is known that its charge is Q, and its axially symmetric electric quadrupole moment has been previously determined. Find the electric potential distribution of this charged body at a distant point.\"\n\nSo, the quadrupole moment is already known. But since it's not given here, maybe I need to compute it? Wait, maybe the problem assumes that I know how to compute the quadrupole moment of a disk? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to write the potential in terms of the quadrupole moment, given that the monopole term is Q/r and the quadrupole term is something involving the quadrupole moment over r³. However, since the problem mentions that the quadrupole moment is axially symmetric and has been determined, perhaps I need to express the potential in terms of that quadrupole moment?\n\nBut without knowing the exact value of the quadrupole moment, how can I proceed? Wait, maybe I need to compute the quadrupole moment of the disk first?\n\nLet me try that. Let's compute the quadrupole moment of a uniformly charged disk. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if the charge distribution is uniform. Wait, the problem says \"it is known that its charge is Q\", but doesn't specify the charge distribution. However, since it's axially symmetric, maybe it's a uniform surface charge?\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Maybe I need to assume uniform surface charge? Or maybe the quadrupole moment is given in terms of Q and a, so that I can express the potential accordingly?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the quadrupole moment for a disk with charge Q. Let me proceed under the assumption that the disk has a uniform surface charge density. Let me check if that's a standard problem.\n\nFor a uniformly charged disk, the surface charge density is σ = Q/(πa²). But let me compute the quadrupole moment.\n\nUsing the definition:\n\n$$\nQ_{kj} = \\int \\left(3 r'_k r'_j - r'^2 \\delta_{kj} \\right) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nSince the disk lies in the xy-plane (let's assume that for simplicity), then for any point on the disk, z' = 0. Therefore, coordinates are (x', y', 0). Let's compute the components of Q_{kj}.\n\nFirst, note that due to axial symmetry, Q_{xx} = Q_{yy} and Q_{xy} = Q_{yx} = 0, etc. Let me compute Q_{xx}:\n\n$$\nQ_{xx} = \\int \\left( 3x'^2 - (x'^2 + y'^2) \\right) \\sigma da' = \\int (2x'^2 - y'^2) \\sigma da' ?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is 3x'x - r'^2 δ_{xx} for the component Q_xx. Wait, more precisely:\n\nFor Q_{xx}:\n\n$$\nQ_{xx} = \\int \\left( 3x'^2 - (x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2) \\right) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nBut since z' = 0 on the disk, this simplifies to:\n\n$$\nQ_{xx} = \\int (3x'^2 - x'^2 - y'^2) \\sigma da' = \\int (2x'^2 - y'^2) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nSimilarly, Q_{yy} would be:\n\n$$\nQ_{yy} = \\int (2y'^2 - x'^2) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nBut due to symmetry, if we consider integrating over the entire disk, integrating x'^2 and y'^2 should give the same result. Let me compute Q_{xx} + Q_{yy}:\n\n$$\nQ_{xx} + Q_{yy} = \\int [ (2x'^2 - y'^2) + (2y'^2 - x'^2) ] \\sigma da' = \\int (x'^2 + y'^2) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n$$\n\\int r'^2 \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nBut since for axial symmetry, Q_{zz} = - (Q_{xx} + Q_{yy}) because the trace of Q_{kj} is zero. Wait, the trace of the quadrupole moment tensor is:\n\nQ_{xx} + Q_{yy} + Q_{zz} = 0.\n\nTherefore, Q_{zz} = - (Q_{xx} + Q_{yy}).\n\nBut let's compute Q_{xx} and Q_{yy}.\n\nSince for a disk, by symmetry, Q_{xx} = Q_{yy}. Let me check:\n\nLet me compute Q_{xx}:\n\n$$\nQ_{xx} = \\int (2x'^2 - y'^2) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nBut since the disk is symmetric with respect to x and y, swapping x and y would leave the integral unchanged. However, Q_{yy} would be:\n\n$$\nQ_{yy} = \\int (2y'^2 - x'^2) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nIf we add Q_{xx} + Q_{yy}:\n\n$$\n\\int [2x'^2 - y'^2 + 2y'^2 - x'^2] \\sigma da' = \\int (x'^2 + y'^2) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nWhich is same as before. However, if we subtract Q_{yy} - Q_{xx}:\n\n$$\n\\int [2y'^2 - x'^2 - 2x'^2 + y'^2] \\sigma da' = \\int [3y'^2 - 3x'^2] \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nBut since the disk is symmetric with respect to x and y, this integral must be zero. Therefore, Q_{yy} - Q_{xx} = 0 => Q_{yy} = Q_{xx}. Therefore, Q_{xx} = Q_{yy} = q, say, and Q_{zz} = - (q + q) = -2q.\n\nTherefore, to compute q, let's compute Q_{xx}:\n\n$$\nQ_{xx} = \\int (2x'^2 - y'^2) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nBut since for a symmetric disk, integrating x'^2 over the disk is same as integrating y'^2. Let me express this in polar coordinates. Let me switch to polar coordinates (r', φ), where x' = r' cosφ, y' = r' sinφ. Then, x'^2 = r'^2 cos²φ, y'^2 = r'^2 sin²φ. The integral becomes:\n\n$$\nQ_{xx} = \\sigma \\int_0^a \\int_0^{2\\pi} [2 r'^2 \\cos^2\\phi - r'^2 \\sin^2\\phi] r' d\\phi dr'\n$$\n\nSimplify inside the integral:\n\n$$\n[2 \\cos^2\\phi - \\sin^2\\phi] r'^3 dr' d\\phi\n$$\n\nLet me compute the angular integral first:\n\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} [2 \\cos^2\\phi - \\sin^2\\phi] d\\phi\n$$\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, note that 2 cos²φ - sin²φ = 2 cos²φ - (1 - cos²φ) = 3 cos²φ - 1.\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} (3 \\cos^2\\phi - 1) d\\phi\n$$\n\nWe can compute this integral:\n\nThe integral of cos²φ over 0 to 2π is π, so 3π - 2π = π? Wait:\n\nWait, ∫0^{2π} cos²φ dφ = π, and ∫0^{2π} 1 dφ = 2π. Therefore, 3π - 2π = π. Therefore, the angular integral is π.\n\nTherefore, Q_{xx} becomes:\n\nσ * π ∫0^a r'^3 dr' = σ π [ r'^4 / 4 ] from 0 to a = σ π (a^4 / 4)\n\nBut σ is Q/(πa²), so substituting:\n\nQ_{xx} = (Q/(πa²)) * π * (a^4 / 4) ) = Q * a² / 4\n\nWait, that seems interesting. Therefore, Q_{xx} = Q a² / 4, and since Q_{zz} = -2 Q_{xx} = - Q a² / 2.\n\nTherefore, the quadrupole moment tensor components are Q_xx = Q_yy = Q a² / 4 and Q_zz = - Q a² / 2.\n\nBut wait, let me check the units. Quadrupole moment has units of charge times length squared. Since Q is charge and a² is length squared, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, if the quadrupole moment is known, then for our purposes, we can use these values. However, the problem says \"its axially symmetric electric quadrupole moment has been previously determined.\" So maybe they expect me to use that quadrupole moment? But since the problem didn't give me the value, but I just calculated it as Q a² / 4 for Q_xx and Q_yy, and -Q a² / 2 for Q_zz.\n\nBut in multipole expansion, the quadrupole term is usually expressed in terms of the quadrupole moment Q. However, different authors define the quadrupole moment differently. For example, sometimes the quadrupole moment is defined as Q_zz - (Q_xx + Q_yy)/2 or something else. Wait, but according to our calculation, the trace is zero, so Q_xx + Q_yy + Q_zz = 0, which is consistent.\n\nBut in the standard definition, for an axially symmetric quadrupole, the quadrupole moment is often denoted as Q, and it's related to the component Q_zz. For example, in some references, the quadrupole moment is defined as:\n\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2} \\int (3z'^2 - r'^2) \\rho(\\mathbf{r'}) d^3r'\n$$\n\nWhich would be exactly Q_zz as per our definition. Therefore, comparing, if we define the quadrupole moment as Q_quad = Q_zz, then in our case, Q_quad = - Q a² / 2. However, depending on the convention, sometimes the quadrupole moment is defined with a positive sign. Let me check.\n\nIn our calculation, Q_zz = - Q a² / 2. If we use the standard definition of the quadrupole moment for an axial symmetric case, which is often written as:\n\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2} \\int (3z'^2 - r'^2) \\rho dV\n$$\n\nWhich would be equal to our Q_zz. Therefore, in our case, since we have a surface charge, it's:\n\n$$\nQ_{quad} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int (3z'^2 - r'^2) \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nBut since z' = 0 for the disk, this becomes:\n\n$$\nQ_{quad} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\int r'^2 \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nWhich is:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot \\int_0^a r'^2 \\cdot 2\\pi r' dr' = - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{a^4}{4} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{Q}{\\pi a^2} \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{a^4}{4} = - \\frac{Q a^2}{4}\n$$\n\nWait, but according to our previous calculation, Q_zz was - Q a² / 2. There seems to be a discrepancy here. Let me check again.\n\nEarlier, we found Q_zz = -2 q, where q was Q_{xx} = Q a² / 4, so Q_zz = - Q a² / 2. However, using the standard quadrupole moment definition, we get Q_quad = - Q a² / 4. Therefore, there's a factor of 2 difference. This suggests that there might be different conventions for defining the quadrupole moment. Therefore, I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recast.\n\nThe quadrupole moment tensor component Q_zz is given by:\n\n$$\nQ_{zz} = \\int (3 z'^2 - r'^2) \\rho dV\n$$\n\nBut for our case, since the disk is in the xy-plane, z' = 0, so:\n\n$$\nQ_{zz} = \\int (- r'^2) \\sigma da' = - \\int r'^2 \\sigma da'\n$$\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n- σ * 2π ∫0^a r'^3 dr' = - σ * 2π [a^4 / 4] = - (Q / π a²) * 2π (a^4 / 4) ) = - Q * 2π a^4 / (4 π a²) ) = - Q a² / 2\n\nSo according to this, Q_zz = - Q a² / 2. However, the standard quadrupole moment (for axial symmetry) is often defined as Q = Q_{zz} / 2 or something else? Wait, according to the standard definition, the quadrupole moment is:\n\n$$\nQ = \\int (3 z'^2 - r'^2) \\rho dV\n$$\n\nWhich is exactly Q_zz. Therefore, according to this, the quadrupole moment is Q_zz = - Q a² / 2. However, in some references, they might define the quadrupole moment as half of that. For example, in some physics textbooks, the quadrupole moment is defined as:\n\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2} \\int (3 z'^2 - r'^2) \\rho dV\n$$\n\nIn which case, it would be - Q a² / 4. Therefore, the problem mentions that the quadrupole moment has been previously determined. Since I don't have the exact value from the problem statement, but I derived it here as - Q a² / 2 (assuming standard definition), I need to proceed with that.\n\nBut maybe the problem assumes that the quadrupole moment is known as, say, Q_q, and I can express the potential in terms of that. However, since the problem says \"Find the electric potential distribution...\", I need to write it in terms of Q, a, and the distance r, and the angle θ.\n\nSo, going back to the quadrupole potential. Earlier, I had derived that the contraction Q_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j equals q(1 - 3 cos²θ), where q = Q_{xx} = Q a² / 4. Wait, let me recap.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nQ_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j = q (sin²θ - 2 cos²θ) = q (1 - 3 cos²θ )\n\nBut since q = Q_{xx} = Q a² / 4, then substituting:\n\nQ_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j = (Q a² / 4)(1 - 3 cos²θ )\n\nBut then the quadrupole term in the potential is:\n\n(1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * [Q_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j ] / r³\n\nTherefore:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * [ (Q a² / 4)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) ] / r³\n\nSimplify:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q a² / 8) * (1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³\n\nAlternatively, since 1 - 3 cos²θ = - 2 ( (3 cos²θ - 1)/2 ), which is -2 P₂(cosθ), where P₂ is the second Legendre polynomial. Therefore:\n\nϕ_quad = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q a² / 8) * 2 P₂(cosθ) / r³ = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q a² / 4) * P₂(cosθ) / r³\n\nBut maybe there's another way to express this. However, regardless, combining with the monopole term:\n\nThe monopole term is:\n\nϕ_mon = (1/(4πε₀)) * Q / r\n\nTherefore, the total potential at a distant point is approximately:\n\nϕ ≈ ϕ_mon + ϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) [ Q / r + (Q a² / 8)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ ] \n\nWait, but earlier I had a factor of 1/2 from the quadrupole term expansion. Let me check again.\n\nThe general formula for the potential up to quadrupole term is:\n\nϕ = (1/(4πε₀)) [ Q / r + (1 / (4 r³)) Σ Q_{kj} n_k n_j + ... ]\n\nWait, different sources might have different coefficients. Let me check the standard multipole expansion.\n\nThe multipole expansion of the potential is:\n\n$$\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{Q}{r} + \\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,j} \\frac{Q_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j}{r^3} + \\cdots \\right]\n$$\n\nYes, so the coefficient for the quadrupole term is 1/2. Therefore, in our case:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * [ Q_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j ] / r³\n\nEarlier, we found Q_{kj} \\hat{r}_k \\hat{r}_j = q(1 - 3 cos²θ ) where q = Q a² / 4. Therefore:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * (Q a² / 4)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q a² / 8)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ \n\nTherefore, combining with the monopole term:\n\nϕ ≈ (1/(4πε₀)) [ Q / r + (Q a² / 8)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ ]\n\nBut let me check the dimensions. The monopole term has units of Q / (4πε₀ r). The quadrupole term has units of Q * a² / r³, which is Q / r * (a / r)^2, so as long as a << r (which is the case for distant points), it's a smaller term, which makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express this in terms of the quadrupole moment. Earlier, we found that Q_zz = - Q a² / 2. Let me denote the quadrupole moment as Q_q = Q_zz = - Q a² / 2. Therefore, Q a² = - 2 Q_q. Substituting into the potential:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-2 Q_q / 8)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ = (1/(4πε₀)) * (- Q_q / 4)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ \n\nBut 1 - 3 cos²θ = - 2 P₂(cosθ), so:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (- Q_q / 4)(-2 P₂(cosθ)) / r³ = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_q / 2) P₂(cosθ) / r³ \n\nWhich is the standard form of the quadrupole potential:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_q / 4) * (3 cos²θ - 1) / r³ \n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf Q_q is defined as the quadrupole moment (Q_zz), then:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_q / 4) * (3 cos²θ - 1) / r³ \n\nYes, because:\n\nFrom above, ϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_q / 2) * P₂(cosθ) / r³ \n\nBut P₂(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ - 1)/2, so:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_q / 2) * (3 cos²θ - 1)/2 / r³ = (1/(4πε₀)) * Q_q (3 cos²θ - 1) / (4 r³ )\n\nTherefore, the standard expression is ϕ_quad = [ Q_q (3 cos²θ - 1) ] / (4 π ε₀ 4 r³ ) ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, ϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ Q_q / 4 * (3 cos²θ - 1)/ r³ ] ?\n\nWait, no, let me do the math again.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_q / 2) * P₂(cosθ) / r³ \n\nBut P₂(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ - 1)/2, so:\n\nϕ_quad = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_q / 2) * (3 cos²θ - 1)/2 / r³ = (1/(4πε₀)) * Q_q (3 cos²θ - 1) / (4 r³ )\n\nYes. Therefore, if Q_q is the quadrupole moment (Q_zz), then:\n\nϕ_quad = [ Q_q (3 cos²θ - 1) ] / (16 π ε₀ r³ )\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, (1/(4πε₀)) * Q_q (3 cos²θ - 1) / (4 r³ ) = Q_q (3 cos²θ - 1) / (4 * 4 π ε₀ r³ ) = Q_q (3 cos²θ - 1) / (16 π ε₀ r³ )\n\nBut according to standard references, the quadrupole potential is:\n\nϕ_quad = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{8 r^3} (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1)\n\nWhere Q is the quadrupole moment. Wait, but here we have Q_q / 16 π ε₀ r³ ... Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy due to different definitions of the quadrupole moment. Since the problem says \"the axially symmetric electric quadrupole moment has been previously determined,\" perhaps we need to express the potential in terms of that given quadrupole moment.\n\nHowever, since in our case, we derived that Q_q = - Q a² / 2, and we expressed the potential as:\n\nϕ ≈ (1/(4πε₀)) [ Q / r + (Q a² / 8)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ ]\n\nAlternatively, substituting Q a² = - 2 Q_q:\n\nϕ ≈ (1/(4πε₀)) [ Q / r + (- 2 Q_q / 8)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ ] = (1/(4πε₀)) [ Q / r - (Q_q / 4)(1 - 3 cos²θ ) / r³ ]\n\nBut since Q_q is negative, this becomes adding a positive term. However, without knowing the exact definition used in the problem's context, it's hard to say. However, since the problem says that the quadrupole moment is known, maybe we can just express the potential as:\n\nϕ ≈ \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{Q}{r} + \\frac{Q_{\\text{quad}}}{4 r^3} (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1) \\right)\n\nBut we need to be careful with signs. Given that our Q_q was negative, and (3 cos²θ - 1) can be positive or negative, depending on θ. However, since the problem states that the quadrupole moment is known, we can denote it as Q_q and write the potential accordingly.\n\nBut since the problem didn't give us the value of Q_q, but we derived it here as Q_q = - Q a² / 2, we can write the potential in terms of Q, a, and r:\n\nϕ ≈ \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{Q}{r} + \\frac{- Q a^2 / 2}{4 r^3} (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1) \\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{Q}{r} - \\frac{Q a^2 (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1)}{8 r^3} \\right)\n\nAlternatively, simplifying:\n\nϕ ≈ \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{a^2 (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1)}{8 r^3} \\right)\n\nThis seems reasonable. However, let me verify with another approach.\n\nAnother way to think about the potential of a disk at a distant point is to consider that at large distances, the disk behaves like a combination of monopole and quadrupole. For a uniformly charged disk, the monopole term is Q/r, and the quadrupole term arises due to the non-spherical charge distribution.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the disk as a collection of rings, each ring contributes to the potential. However, expanding for large r would lead to the same multipole expansion. Therefore, the result we obtained via quadrupole moment seems valid.\n\nBut let me check dimensions again. The term a² / r³ has units of 1 / r, same as 1 / r, so the whole expression in the parenthesis is 1 / r (1 - ...), which is okay.\n\nTherefore, the electric potential at a distant point is approximately the monopole term plus the quadrupole term, given by:\n\nϕ ≈ \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{a^2 (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1)}{8 r^3} \\right)\n\nAlternatively, combining terms:\n\nϕ ≈ \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{a^2 (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1)}{8 r^2} \\right)\n\nBut this is valid for r >> a.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's a standard formula for the potential of a charged disk at large distances. For example, if we consider a disk as a charged ring, but a disk is more extended.\n\nWait, for a ring of radius a and charge Q, the potential on the axis at distance z is Q / (4πε₀ √(z² + a²)). Expanding for large z, we get Q / (4πε₀ z) * [1 - (a²)/(2 z²) + ...]. Therefore, the potential of a ring has a monopole term and a quadrupole term? Wait, but for a ring, the quadrupole moment is non-zero?\n\nWait, for a ring, the charge distribution is symmetric about the axis but has a quadrupole moment. Let me compute the quadrupole moment of a ring. For a ring of radius a, charge Q, lying in the xy-plane.\n\nUsing the quadrupole tensor definition:\n\nQ_{zz} = ∫ (3 z'^2 - r'^2) σ da'\n\nBut for the ring, z' = 0, and r' = a for all points on the ring. Therefore:\n\nQ_{zz} = ∫ (- a²) σ da' = - a² * Q = - Q a²\n\nBut for a ring, the quadrupole moment is different from the disk. For the disk, we found Q_zz = - Q a² / 2. So the disk's quadrupole moment is half that of a ring? That makes sense because the disk can be thought of as a collection of rings from radius 0 to a, each contributing to the quadrupole moment. The integral over r' would give a factor of 1/2 compared to a single ring at radius a.\n\nTherefore, returning, for the disk, the quadrupole term is indeed - Q a² / 2 for Q_zz, leading to the potential expression we derived.\n\nTherefore, unless there is a miscalculation in my steps, this should be correct. Therefore, the electric potential at a distant point due to the charged disk is approximately the monopole term plus the quadrupole term as derived.\n\nBut let me check once more with an example. Suppose θ = 0, i.e., along the axis of the disk. Then cosθ = 1, so 3 cos²θ - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2. Therefore, the potential along the axis is:\n\nϕ ≈ \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{a^2 * 2}{8 r^3} \\right ) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{a^2}{4 r^3} \\right )\n\nBut what is the actual potential along the axis of a charged disk? The exact potential at a point on the axis at distance z from the disk is:\n\nϕ = \\frac{\\sigma}{2 \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\sqrt{z² + a²} - |z| \\right )\n\nFor z > 0, this becomes:\n\nϕ = \\frac{\\sigma}{2 \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\sqrt{z² + a²} - z \\right )\n\nExpanding for large z:\n\nsqrt(z² + a²) ≈ z + a²/(2 z) - a^4/(8 z³) + ...\n\nTherefore,\n\nϕ ≈ \\frac{\\sigma}{2 \\epsilon_0} \\left( z + a²/(2 z) - z - ... \\right ) ≈ \\frac{\\sigma}{2 \\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{a²}{2 z} = \\frac{\\sigma a²}{4 \\epsilon_0 z}\n\nBut σ a² = Q, so ϕ ≈ Q / (4 π ε₀ z) * π ? Wait, hold on. σ is Q / (π a²), so σ a² = Q / π ?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nσ = Q / (π a²). Therefore, σ a² = Q / π. Therefore,\n\nϕ ≈ (Q / π) / (4 ε₀ z) ) = Q / (4 π ε₀ z) * 1/π ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the exact expression is:\n\nϕ ≈ σ a² / (4 ε₀ z) = (Q / π a²) * a² / (4 ε₀ z) ) = Q / (4 π ε₀ z )\n\nBut according to our multipole expansion, along the axis (θ = 0):\n\nϕ ≈ Q / (4 π ε₀) [ 1/z - a²/(4 z³) ]\n\nBut the exact expansion for large z gives ϕ ≈ Q / (4 π ε₀ z ). Wait, but according to our multipole expansion, there's an additional term - Q a² / (16 π ε₀ z³ ). But according to the exact expansion, there is no such term? That suggests a contradiction, which means I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nExact potential along axis:\n\nϕ = [σ / (2 ε₀)] [sqrt(z² + a²) - z] \n\nFor large z, sqrt(z² + a²) ≈ z + a²/(2 z) - a^4/(8 z³) + ..., so:\n\nϕ ≈ [σ / (2 ε₀)] [ z + a²/(2 z) - a^4/(8 z³) - z ] = [σ / (2 ε₀)] [ a²/(2 z) - a^4/(8 z³) ] \n\n= σ a² / (4 ε₀ z) - σ a^4 / (16 ε₀ z³ )\n\nBut σ = Q / (π a²), so substituting:\n\nϕ ≈ [ Q / (π a²) * a² / (4 ε₀ z ) ] - [ Q / (π a²) * a^4 / (16 ε₀ z³ ) ] \n\nSimplifies to:\n\nQ / (4 π ε₀ z ) - Q a² / (16 π ε₀ z³ )\n\nWhich matches our multipole expansion result:\n\nFrom earlier, our multipole expansion gave along θ = 0:\n\nϕ ≈ Q / (4 π ε₀) [ 1/z - a²/(4 z³ ) ] = Q / (4 π ε₀ z ) - Q a² / (16 π ε₀ z³ )\n\nYes! Perfect, it matches. Therefore, our quadrupole term is correct. Therefore, the potential expression we derived is correct.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the electric potential at a distant point (r >> a) due to a uniformly charged disk with total charge Q and radius a is approximately:\n\n$$\n\\phi(r, \\theta) \\approx \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{a^2 (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1)}{8 r^3} \\right)\n$$\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n$$\n\\phi(r, \\theta) \\approx \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{a^2 (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1)}{8 r^2} \\right)\n$$\n\nThis accounts for the monopole and quadrupole contributions. Since the disk is axially symmetric, there are no dipole terms, and higher-order terms (octupole, etc.) are negligible at large distances.\n\nTherefore, this should be the answer expected by the problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe electric potential at a distant point is approximately \\boxed{\\dfrac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{r} - \\dfrac{a^2 (3 \\cos^2\\theta - 1)}{8 r^3} \\right)}.\n</think>"}
