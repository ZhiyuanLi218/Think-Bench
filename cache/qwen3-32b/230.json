So, we have a function f, and its inverse f⁻¹. We're given some values of the function: f(1) = 2, f(2) = 6, and f(3) = 5. The question is asking for f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6)). Hmm, inverses can sometimes be tricky, but let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an inverse function is. If f is a function that takes an input x and gives an output y, then the inverse function f⁻¹ takes y as an input and gives back x. So, if f(a) = b, then f⁻¹(b) = a. That seems straightforward. So, basically, the inverse function undoes what the original function did.\n\nGiven that, let me note down the given information:\n\n- f(1) = 2 ⇒ f⁻¹(2) = 1\n- f(2) = 6 ⇒ f⁻¹(6) = 2\n- f(3) = 5 ⇒ f⁻¹(5) = 3\n\nSo, if I need to find f⁻¹(6), according to the second bullet point above, that should be 2. Let me check that again. Since f(2) = 6, then yes, applying the inverse function to 6 should give me back the original input, which is 2. So f⁻¹(6) = 2.\n\nBut the problem is asking for f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6)). So first, compute the inner f⁻¹(6), which we just found is 2. Then, we have to compute f⁻¹ of that result, which is f⁻¹(2). From the first bullet point, since f(1) = 2, then f⁻¹(2) = 1. Therefore, putting it all together, f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6)) = f⁻¹(2) = 1. So the answer should be 1?\n\nWait, let me verify again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me write out the steps:\n\n1. Start with f⁻¹(6). Since f(2) = 6, then by definition of inverse function, f⁻¹(6) = 2. So that's straightforward.\n\n2. Now take that result, which is 2, and plug it into f⁻¹ again: f⁻¹(2). Now, looking at our given function values, we have f(1) = 2, so again by definition of inverse function, f⁻¹(2) = 1. Therefore, f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6)) = f⁻¹(2) = 1. \n\nSeems correct. Let me just check if there's any possibility of confusion here. Sometimes with functions and inverses, people mix up the inputs and outputs, but in this case, since we're given direct mappings, it's pretty clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about building the inverse function's table. If f maps 1→2, 2→6, 3→5, then f⁻¹ would map 2→1, 6→2, 5→3. So, if I write down f⁻¹(x):\n\n- When x = 2, f⁻¹(x) = 1\n- When x = 6, f⁻¹(x) = 2\n- When x = 5, f⁻¹(x) = 3\n\nSo, if I want f⁻¹(6), looking at the table, it's 2. Then f⁻¹(2) is 1. So yes, again, f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6)) is 1. \n\nIs there a chance that the function f isn't one-to-one or something? Well, since it has an inverse, it must be one-to-one (injective) on its domain. Since we have different outputs for different inputs: f(1)=2, f(2)=6, f(3)=5. All outputs are unique for each input given here, so that's fine. So the inverse function is properly defined for these values.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let's try to write down f and f⁻¹ as sets of ordered pairs. For f, we have:\n\nf = { (1, 2), (2, 6), (3, 5) }\n\nThen, the inverse function f⁻¹ would be the set of ordered pairs with the coordinates swapped:\n\nf⁻¹ = { (2, 1), (6, 2), (5, 3) }\n\nTherefore, if we look up f⁻¹(6), we find the pair (6, 2), so f⁻¹(6) = 2. Then, looking up f⁻¹(2), we find the pair (2, 1), so f⁻¹(2) = 1. Therefore, the composition f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6)) is indeed 1. \n\nI think this confirms it again. So unless there's some hidden trick or more to the function f that isn't given here, but the problem doesn't provide any more information. The problem only gives three specific mappings for f, and asks about f⁻¹ composed with f⁻¹ at 6. Since we can directly compute it using the given values, and there's no ambiguity because the inverse is properly defined for these points, the answer must be 1.\n\nWait, just to check once more, maybe I misread the question? Let me check again:\n\n\"Suppose that f is a function and f⁻¹ is the inverse of f. If f(1)=2, f(2)=6, and f(3)=5, then what is f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6))?\"\n\nNo, I didn't misread. The key steps are:\n\n- f⁻¹(6) is the value x such that f(x) = 6. From the given, f(2)=6, so x=2. Hence, f⁻¹(6)=2.\n\n- Then, f⁻¹(2) is the value y such that f(y)=2. From the given, f(1)=2, so y=1. Hence, f⁻¹(2)=1.\n\nTherefore, f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6))=f⁻¹(2)=1. \n\nYes, that's consistent. I don't see any issues here. Maybe if there were more information or if the function was defined differently, but with what's given, 1 is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, if someone tried to overcomplicate it by trying to find an explicit formula for f or f⁻¹, but since only specific values are given, that's unnecessary. The problem is testing understanding of inverse functions and composition, and how to apply them with given mappings.\n\nAnother angle: Sometimes people confuse f⁻¹(f(x)) vs f(f⁻¹(x)). But in this case, we are dealing with f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6)), which is like applying inverse function twice. First to 6, then to the result. Since 6 is an output of f, applying f⁻¹ once brings us back to the input, then applying f⁻¹ again is like taking the inverse of that result. But since the first result is an input to f, which is now an output of f⁻¹. Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of f⁻¹ as a function, then f⁻¹(6) is 2, as established. Then f⁻¹(2) is 1. So the composition is 1. So, yeah, straightforward.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple ways. The answer is 1. Maybe to recap:\n\nf⁻¹(6) = 2 because f(2) = 6.\n\nThen f⁻¹(2) = 1 because f(1) = 2.\n\nTherefore, f⁻¹(f⁻¹(6)) = 1.\n\nYep, that's solid. I don't see any errors in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>"}
