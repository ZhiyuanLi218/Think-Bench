Hmm, let's start by recalling what resonance structures are. Resonance structures are different ways to represent the bonding in a molecule when a single Lewis structure can't fully capture the bonding due to delocalized electrons. In the case of the nitrate ion, there are multiple resonance structures where the double bonds can be in different positions.\n\nFirst, I should probably draw the Lewis structure of NO3⁻ to understand the bonding. Nitrogen is the central atom, and there are three oxygen atoms around it. The nitrate ion has a -1 charge. Let me count the valence electrons. Nitrogen has 5, each oxygen has 6, so 5 + (3×6) = 5 + 18 = 23. Then add one more for the negative charge, making it 24 valence electrons.\n\nNow, arranging the atoms: nitrogen in the center, connected to three oxygens. Each single bond would be a sigma bond. Let's start by connecting each oxygen with a single bond. That uses 3 bonds, so 6 electrons. Now we have 24 - 6 = 18 electrons left. Each oxygen needs 6 more electrons to complete their octet (since each already has 2 from the single bond), so 3 oxygens × 6 electrons = 18. But wait, nitrogen only has 6 electrons around it (3 bonds). It needs an octet, so maybe there's a double bond somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the formal charges. Let's see. If all are single bonds, nitrogen would have a formal charge of 5 - (0 + 6/2) = 5 - 3 = +2. Each oxygen would have 6 - (6 + 2/2) = 6 - (6 +1) = -1. So total charge would be +2 + 3×(-1) = -1, which matches the nitrate ion's -1 charge. But nitrogen with +2 and three oxygens with -1 each. However, nitrogen can have expanded octet? Wait, nitrogen is in the second period, so it can't have an expanded octet. So maybe there's a double bond here.\n\nLet me try forming one double bond. Suppose one N=O double bond and two N-O single bonds. Let's count the electrons. Each single bond is 2 electrons, each double bond is 4. So total bonds: 2×2 (for two single bonds) + 4 (for the double bond) = 8 electrons. Then we have 24 - 8 = 16 electrons left. Each oxygen in single bonds needs 6 more electrons (since they have 2 from the bond), so 2 oxygens × 6 = 12. The double-bonded oxygen has 4 electrons from the bond, so needs 4 more. Total 12 + 4 = 16. That works. So the Lewis structure would have one double bond and two single bonds, with the double bond able to be in any of the three positions, hence three resonance structures.\n\nNow, each single bond is a sigma bond. Each double bond is one sigma and one pi bond. So in each resonance structure, there are three N-O bonds: one double bond (sigma + pi) and two single bonds (each sigma). Therefore, total sigma bonds: 3 (each bond has at least one sigma). Total pi bonds: 1 (from the double bond). Wait, but the question is asking about each resonance form. So each resonance form would have three sigma bonds and one pi bond? But wait, in each resonance structure, there are three bonds: one double bond (which is one sigma and one pi) and two single bonds (each sigma). So total sigma bonds: 3 (each bond has a sigma component), and one pi bond. So the answer would be 3 sigma and 1 pi? But looking at the options, D is 3 sigma and 1 pi. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's count again. In each resonance structure, there are three bonds between N and O: one double bond and two single bonds. Each single bond is one sigma. The double bond is one sigma and one pi. Therefore, total sigma bonds: 3 (from the three bonds), and pi bonds: 1. So yes, 3 sigma and 1 pi. So option D is the answer. But wait, the options given are A:1 sigma and 2 pi, B:2 sigma and 1 pi, C:1 sigma and 1 pi, D:3 sigma and 1 pi. So D is the correct one. But let me think again. Is there a possibility that the question is asking per bond or overall?\n\nWait, the question says \"how many sigma and how many pi bonds?\" in each resonance form. So the entire structure. So yes, each resonance form has three sigma bonds and one pi bond. Therefore, the answer is D. But I need to make sure. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, sigma bonds are single bonds, and each double bond has one sigma and one pi. But wait, no. Wait, sigma bonds are the first bonds between two atoms, pi bonds are the second, third. So in a single bond: 1 sigma. In a double bond: 1 sigma + 1 pi. In a triple bond: 1 sigma + 2 pi. So for the nitrate ion, each resonance structure has three N-O bonds: one double bond (1 sigma + 1 pi) and two single bonds (each 1 sigma). So total sigma bonds: 1 (from double) + 2 (from singles) = 3. Total pi bonds: 1 (from the double bond). So yes, D:3 sigma and 1 pi. So the answer is D. But wait, the options include D as 3 sigma and 1 pi. So the correct answer is D. But let me check if I messed up the count of bonds.\n\nAnother way: in a molecule, the number of sigma bonds is equal to the number of single bonds plus the number of multiple bonds (since each multiple bond has one sigma). The number of pi bonds is equal to the number of multiple bonds minus the number of single bonds? No, more accurately, each double bond has one pi bond, each triple bond has two pi bonds. So for nitrate, each resonance structure has one double bond (so one pi bond) and three sigma bonds. So yes, D is correct. Therefore, the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
