The problem says that Al walks down an escalator that's moving up and counts 150 steps, while Bob walks up the same escalator and counts 75 steps. Also, Al's walking speed is three times Bob's. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the situation. There's an escalator that's moving upwards. Al is walking down against the escalator's direction, and Bob is walking up in the same direction as the escalator. Both count the number of steps they take during their respective journeys. The question is about finding the total number of steps on the escalator that you can see at any one time, which is probably the length of the escalator in steps.\n\nI remember that escalator problems often involve relative speeds. Since the escalator is moving, the effective speed of a person relative to the ground (or relative to the escalator steps) is their own walking speed plus or minus the escalator's speed. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me denote some variables:\n\nLet N be the total number of visible steps on the escalator. This is what we need to find.\n\nLet v_e be the speed of the escalator in steps per unit time. Since the escalator is moving up, it's contributing steps upwards.\n\nLet v_A be Al's walking speed in steps per unit time. Similarly, v_B is Bob's walking speed. According to the problem, v_A = 3*v_B.\n\nNow, when Al is walking down, he's moving against the escalator. So his effective speed relative to the ground would be his walking speed minus the escalator's speed. Wait, but since he's going down and the escalator is going up, his effective speed relative to the ground is v_A - v_e. However, relative to the escalator steps themselves, maybe it's different? Hmm, need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think about the time each person spends on the escalator and how many steps they take during that time.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFor Al:\n\nHe walks down the escalator and counts 150 steps. Let me denote the time he takes to walk down as t_A. In that time, he takes 150 steps, so his walking speed is v_A = 150 / t_A.\n\nBut during this time, the escalator is moving upwards. The escalator is also moving steps upwards. So, relative to the ground, the distance Al covers is equal to the length of the escalator, which is N steps. Wait, but how does that relate to his speed and the escalator's speed?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as relative motion. From Al's perspective, if the escalator wasn't moving, he would have to walk N steps to get down. But since the escalator is moving up, it's effectively shortening his journey? Or lengthening?\n\nWait, no. If the escalator is moving up, while Al is walking down, then relative to the escalator, Al's speed is his walking speed plus the escalator's speed? Wait, maybe I need to think about reference frames.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we are in a frame of reference where the escalator is stationary. Then, if Al is walking down, he would just walk N steps. But in reality, the escalator is moving. So maybe I need to consider the relative speeds.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. The total number of steps that Al covers is the number of steps he takes minus the number of steps the escalator moves during his walk? Wait, no. If the escalator is moving up, while he's moving down, the total number of steps he has to walk is equal to the number of steps on the escalator plus the number of steps that the escalator brings up during his walk? Wait, not sure.\n\nLet me think numerically. Suppose the escalator is not moving. Then, Al would have to walk N steps to get down. But if the escalator is moving up, then while Al is walking down, the escalator is bringing steps up. So, effectively, Al has to walk more steps? Wait, no. If the escalator is moving up, then it's helping Bob who is going up, but hindering Al who is going down. Therefore, Al has to walk more steps than N because while he is walking down, the escalator is bringing steps up, so he has to cover both the original N steps plus the ones that the escalator is moving up during his walk.\n\nWait, but he counts 150 steps. So maybe N is less than 150? Let me think.\n\nLet me try to model it with equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor Al:\n\nWhen he walks down, his speed relative to the ground is (v_A - v_e) steps per unit time. Because he's walking down, and the escalator is moving up. So his net speed relative to the ground is his speed minus the escalator's speed.\n\nBut the length of the escalator is N steps. However, the time it takes for him to walk down would be the time until he covers N steps relative to the ground? Wait, no. Wait, the escalator is moving, so the number of steps he needs to walk is not just N. Wait, maybe I need to think about the time he spends on the escalator.\n\nAlternatively, during the time Al is walking down, the escalator is moving up. So, the total number of steps he has to walk is equal to the number of steps on the escalator plus the number of steps the escalator moved up during his walk. Wait, that might make sense. Because if the escalator is moving up, while he is moving down, then relative to the escalator, he has to cover N steps plus the steps that the escalator is bringing up during his walk.\n\nBut how do we express that?\n\nLet me denote t_A as the time Al takes to walk down. In that time, he takes 150 steps. Since his walking speed is v_A steps per unit time, then t_A = 150 / v_A.\n\nDuring this time, the escalator has moved up v_e * t_A steps. Therefore, the total number of steps that Al had to walk is N + v_e * t_A, because he had to cover the original N steps plus the ones that the escalator brought up during his walk. Therefore:\n\nN + v_e * t_A = v_A * t_A => N = (v_A - v_e) * t_A\n\nWait, but since he took 150 steps, which is v_A * t_A = 150. Therefore, N = 150 - v_e * t_A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe N = v_A * t_A - v_e * t_A = (v_A - v_e) * t_A. That seems right. Because from the ground perspective, the length of the escalator is N steps. Al is moving down relative to the ground at speed (v_A - v_e), so the time to traverse the escalator is N / (v_A - v_e). But also, during that time, he took 150 steps, so t_A = 150 / v_A. Therefore:\n\nN / (v_A - v_e) = 150 / v_A => N = 150 * (v_A - v_e)/v_A = 150*(1 - v_e / v_A)\n\nSimilarly, for Bob, who is walking up. Let me do the same analysis.\n\nBob walks up the escalator, which is also moving up, so his effective speed relative to the ground is v_B + v_e. The time he takes is t_B, during which he takes 75 steps, so t_B = 75 / v_B. Also, the length of the escalator N is covered by his effective speed:\n\nN = (v_B + v_e) * t_B = (v_B + v_e) * (75 / v_B) => N = 75*(1 + v_e / v_B)\n\nSo now, we have two expressions for N:\n\nFrom Al: N = 150*(1 - v_e / v_A)\n\nFrom Bob: N = 75*(1 + v_e / v_B)\n\nAlso, we know that v_A = 3*v_B. Let me denote v_B as x, so v_A = 3x. Then, substituting into the equations:\n\nFrom Al: N = 150*(1 - v_e / (3x))\n\nFrom Bob: N = 75*(1 + v_e / x)\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n150*(1 - v_e/(3x)) = 75*(1 + v_e/x)\n\nLet me divide both sides by 75 to simplify:\n\n2*(1 - v_e/(3x)) = 1 + v_e/x\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n2 - (2*v_e)/(3x) = 1 + v_e/x\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n1 - (2*v_e)/(3x) = v_e/x\n\nMultiply both sides by 3x to eliminate denominators:\n\n3x - 2*v_e = 3*v_e\n\nBring terms with v_e to one side:\n\n3x = 5*v_e => v_e = (3/5)*x\n\nSo the escalator's speed is 3/5 of Bob's speed. Now, we can plug this back into one of the equations for N. Let's use the Bob equation:\n\nN = 75*(1 + v_e / x) = 75*(1 + (3/5)x / x) = 75*(1 + 3/5) = 75*(8/5) = 75*(1.6) = 120.\n\nAlternatively, check with Al's equation:\n\nN = 150*(1 - v_e/(3x)) = 150*(1 - (3/5)x/(3x)) = 150*(1 - (1/5)) = 150*(4/5) = 120. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, the number of visible steps on the escalator is 120.\n\nWait, let me just check my reasoning again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, for Al going down, his effective speed relative to ground is v_A - v_e, and the time he takes is t_A = N / (v_A - v_e). But also, since he took 150 steps, t_A = 150 / v_A. Therefore, equate them: N / (v_A - v_e) = 150 / v_A => N = 150*(v_A - v_e)/v_A. Which is 150*(1 - v_e / v_A). That seems right.\n\nSimilarly for Bob, going up, effective speed v_B + v_e, time t_B = N / (v_B + v_e) and also t_B = 75 / v_B. Therefore N = 75*(v_B + v_e)/v_B = 75*(1 + v_e / v_B). Correct.\n\nThen, substituting v_A = 3*v_B and solving gives N = 120. Seems correct.\n\nLet me check with numbers. Suppose Bob's speed is 5 steps per unit time. Then escalator speed is 3/5 * 5 = 3 steps per unit time. Then Al's speed is 3*5=15 steps per unit time.\n\nFor Bob: his effective speed is 5 + 3 = 8 steps per unit time. He counts 75 steps, so time taken is 75 / 5 = 15 units of time. In that time, escalator moved 3*15 = 45 steps. So total steps on escalator should be steps Bob walked minus escalator steps? Wait, no. Wait, from the ground perspective, Bob is moving up at 8 steps per unit time for 15 units of time, so total steps N = 8*15 = 120. Which matches. Alternatively, from Bob's perspective, he took 75 steps, but the escalator also brought up 45 steps. So total steps on escalator is 75 - 45 = 30? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, why?\n\nWait, no. If Bob is walking up, then the escalator is helping him. So the number of steps he has to walk is equal to the total steps N minus the steps that the escalator brings him up. Wait, maybe?\n\nLet me think. If the escalator wasn't moving, he would have to walk N steps. But since the escalator is moving up, during the time he walks, the escalator brings some steps up, so he doesn't have to walk all N steps. Therefore, N = steps he took + steps the escalator brought him? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the escalator is moving up at v_e steps per unit time. Bob is moving up at v_B steps per unit time relative to the escalator. Therefore, relative to the ground, his speed is v_B + v_e. The total number of steps on the escalator is N. The time to reach the top is t_B = N / (v_B + v_e). But during this time, Bob has taken v_B * t_B steps. Therefore:\n\nNumber of steps Bob took: v_B * t_B = v_B * (N / (v_B + v_e)) = N * v_B / (v_B + v_e). According to the problem, this is equal to 75. Therefore:\n\nN * v_B / (v_B + v_e) = 75 => N = 75*(v_B + v_e)/v_B, which is the same as before. So in numbers, with N=120, v_B=5, v_e=3:\n\nN * v_B / (v_B + v_e) = 120 * 5 / (5 + 3) = 600 / 8 = 75. Correct. So Bob took 75 steps. Makes sense.\n\nSimilarly for Al. If Al is going down, his speed relative to ground is v_A - v_e. Time to go down is N / (v_A - v_e). During that time, he took v_A * t_A steps, which is v_A * [N / (v_A - v_e)] = N * v_A / (v_A - v_e). According to problem, this is 150. So N = 150*(v_A - v_e)/v_A. In numbers, with v_A=15, v_e=3:\n\nN * v_A / (v_A - v_e) = 120 * 15 / (15 - 3) = 1800 / 12 = 150. Correct. So that works.\n\nTherefore, my answer of 120 seems to check out with the example numbers. Therefore, I think N=120 is correct.\n\nSo the number of visible steps on the escalator is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of visible steps on the escalator is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>"}
