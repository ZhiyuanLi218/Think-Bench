The first one is 5-isopropylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol reacting with HBr to form product A. The second reaction is hex-1-en-3-ol with HBr forming product B. I need to determine which of the options A to D is correct.\n\nStarting with the first reaction: 5-isopropylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol + HBr → A. Let me draw the structure in my mind. The molecule is a cyclohexene ring with an isopropyl group at position 5 and a hydroxyl group at position 1. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (since it's cyclohex-2-en). \n\nWhen an alcohol reacts with HBr, typically it undergoes an acid-catalyzed substitution where the hydroxyl group is protonated, making it a better leaving group (water), and then Br⁻ attacks the protonated oxygen, leading to the formation of an alkyl bromide. However, in this case, the molecule also has a double bond. Wait, but the hydroxyl is on a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So maybe there's a possibility of carbocation formation and rearrangement, or maybe some kind of addition reaction?\n\nBut wait, the starting material is an enol (a compound with a double bond adjacent to a hydroxyl group). In such cases, when HBr is added, there might be a possibility of addition to the double bond as well as substitution at the hydroxyl group. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group might influence the reaction pathway. \n\nLet me think. In the case of alcohols, HBr typically leads to substitution (S_N1 or S_N2) where the -OH is protonated, then Br⁻ attacks. However, if there's a double bond, maybe the HBr adds across the double bond. But the hydroxyl group is on a different carbon than the double bond. The structure is cyclohex-2-en-1-ol, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the hydroxyl is on carbon 1. \n\nWait, maybe the hydroxyl group is adjacent to the double bond? Let me visualize the structure again. Cyclohexane ring: positions 1 (OH), 2 (double bond start), 3 (double bond end), and 5 (isopropyl group). The hydroxyl is on carbon 1, adjacent to the double bond between 2 and 3. So the hydroxyl is on carbon 1, which is adjacent to the double bond. So the molecule is an enol. \n\nIn such a case, when HBr is added, perhaps there's a possibility of either adding HBr across the double bond or substituting the hydroxyl group. But which one is more likely? \n\nIn some cases, when an enol is treated with HBr, the reaction can proceed via a carbocation mechanism. Let me consider the possible mechanisms. \n\nIf the hydroxyl group is protonated first, making it a good leaving group (water), then the loss of water would generate a carbocation at carbon 1. But carbon 1 is adjacent to the double bond, so the carbocation could be stabilized by resonance with the double bond. Alternatively, maybe the HBr adds across the double bond. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the HBr adds to the double bond in a way that forms a more stable carbocation. Let's think about the addition of HBr to the double bond. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. According to Markovnikov's rule, the H would add to the less substituted carbon, and the Br would add to the more substituted carbon. But since the ring has an isopropyl group at position 5, maybe the stability of the carbocation is influenced by that. \n\nWait, the double bond is between 2 and 3. Carbon 2 is adjacent to the hydroxyl group on carbon 1. So adding H to carbon 2 and Br to carbon 3. But let me think about the carbocation formed. If the H adds to carbon 2, then the carbocation would be on carbon 3. However, carbon 3 is adjacent to carbon 4, which is adjacent to the isopropyl group at carbon 5. Maybe the carbocation can be stabilized by the adjacent isopropyl group through hyperconjugation or something else. Alternatively, the carbocation could be stabilized by resonance with the adjacent hydroxyl group. Wait, but the hydroxyl is on carbon 1, which is two carbons away from the double bond. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hydroxyl group is involved in the reaction. If the hydroxyl is protonated and leaves as water, forming a carbocation at carbon 1. Then Br⁻ could attack that carbocation. But carbon 1 is adjacent to the double bond, so maybe the carbocation can be stabilized by resonance with the double bond. \n\nLet me try to draw the possible structures. \n\nFirst possibility: the hydroxyl group is protonated, water leaves, forming a carbocation at carbon 1. The carbocation at carbon 1 is adjacent to the double bond (between 2 and 3). The positive charge could delocalize into the double bond, forming a resonance-stabilized carbocation. Then Br⁻ could attack at the carbon that was originally part of the double bond. \n\nIn this case, the attack would occur at carbon 2 or 3. The original carbocation is at carbon 1. The resonance would give a carbocation at carbon 2 or 3. Let's see: \n\nThe structure is cyclohex-2-en-1-ol. When the hydroxyl leaves, the carbocation is at carbon 1. The adjacent double bond (between 2 and 3) can resonate to place the positive charge at carbon 2 or 3. So the resonance would give a carbocation at carbon 2 (since the double bond is between 2 and 3, and the positive charge can be on 2 or 3). \n\nIf the carbocation is at carbon 2, then Br⁻ would attack there, giving a bromide at carbon 2. But the original question is about product A. The options given are: \n\nA: 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol \nB: 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene \nC: 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene \nD: 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol \n\nWait, but the options for A are either 3-bromo... with different ring structures. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption A: A = 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol, B = (E)-1-bromohex-2-ene \nOption B: A = 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene, B = 2-bromohexan-3-ol \nOption C: A = 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene, B = (E)-1-bromohex-2-ene \nOption D: A = 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol, B = 2-bromohexan-3-ol \n\nSo for product A, the question is whether the bromine is on carbon 3, and whether the ring is a cyclohexane (no double bond) or cyclohexene (still has a double bond). \n\nIf the hydroxyl is replaced by Br, then the ring would still have a double bond (since the hydroxyl was on a different carbon). However, if the reaction involves the double bond, then maybe the double bond is lost. \n\nLet me think again. If the hydroxyl group is protonated and leaves, forming a carbocation at carbon 1, which then is resonance-stabilized with the double bond. The attack by Br⁻ would give a bromide at carbon 2 or 3. However, if the attack occurs at carbon 2, then the double bond would still be between 2 and 3. But if the attack occurs at carbon 3, then the double bond might shift. \n\nAlternatively, if the HBr adds across the double bond. Let me consider that. The double bond is between 2 and 3. Adding HBr would give either H on 2 and Br on 3 or vice versa. According to Markovnikov, the H would go to the less substituted carbon. Since the double bond is between 2 and 3, and carbon 2 is adjacent to the hydroxyl on 1, which is more substituted. So carbon 2 is more substituted than carbon 3 (since carbon 3 is adjacent to carbon 4, which is adjacent to the isopropyl group at 5). Wait, maybe not. Let me think about the substituents. \n\nThe cyclohexene ring has an isopropyl group at position 5. Let me imagine the ring structure. Carbon 1 has the hydroxyl, carbon 2 is double bonded to carbon 3. Carbon 5 has the isopropyl. So carbon 2 is adjacent to carbon 1 (OH) and carbon 3. Carbon 3 is adjacent to carbon 2 and carbon 4. Carbon 4 is adjacent to carbon 3 and 5 (isopropyl). So carbon 3 is adjacent to carbon 4, which is adjacent to the isopropyl group. So carbon 3 is more substituted than carbon 2? Because carbon 2 is adjacent to carbon 1 (OH) and carbon 3, while carbon 3 is adjacent to carbon 2 and carbon 4 (which is adjacent to isopropyl). So maybe carbon 3 is more substituted. Therefore, Markovnikov addition would have the H add to the less substituted carbon, which would be carbon 2, and Br to carbon 3. \n\nSo adding HBr across the double bond would give a bromide at carbon 3. However, the hydroxyl group is still present at carbon 1. So the product would be 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol (since the double bond is now gone if HBr added across it, making it a cyclohexane ring). Wait, no—if the HBr adds across the double bond, then the double bond is consumed, and the ring becomes a cyclohexane with a bromide at 3 and hydroxyl at 1. So that would be 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol. Which is option A and D for product A. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction is a substitution at the hydroxyl group, leading to 1-bromo... but the options don't have that. So maybe the correct product for A is 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol, which is option A and D. \n\nNow for product B: hex-1-en-3-ol + HBr → B. \n\nHex-1-en-3-ol is an alcohol with a double bond. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-OH? No, wait. The name is hex-1-en-3-ol. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl is on carbon 3. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-OH? No, that would be hex-1-en-5-ol. Wait, the numbering is such that the hydroxyl is on carbon 3 and the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃? No, wait. Let me count: hexane is 6 carbons. The double bond is between 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-OH? No, because that would be the hydroxyl on carbon 6. Wait, if the double bond is between 1 and 2, then the hydroxyl on carbon 3 would be CH₂=CH-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃. Wait, but the correct numbering for the hydroxyl would be lower. Let me think again. \n\nThe correct IUPAC name for a six-carbon chain with a double bond between 1 and 2 and a hydroxyl on carbon 3 would be hex-1-en-3-ol. The structure is: \n\nCarbon 1: CH₂= \nCarbon 2: CH- \nCarbon 3: CH₂- \nCarbon 4: CH₂- \nCarbon 5: CH₂- \nCarbon 6: CH₃ \n\nWait, no. Let me write it properly. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-OH? No, that would be the hydroxyl on carbon 6. To have the hydroxyl on carbon 3, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃. So the hydroxyl is on carbon 3, and the double bond is between 1 and 2. \n\nNow, when this reacts with HBr, what happens? Again, there are two possibilities: addition to the double bond or substitution at the hydroxyl. \n\nIf we consider substitution at the hydroxyl group, then protonating the hydroxyl to make it a better leaving group, water leaves, forming a carbocation at carbon 3. However, carbon 3 is adjacent to the double bond (between 1 and 2). So the carbocation could be stabilized by resonance with the adjacent double bond. \n\nAlternatively, the HBr could add across the double bond. Let's consider both possibilities. \n\nFirst, substitution at the hydroxyl: protonate the hydroxyl, water leaves, forming a carbocation at carbon 3. The adjacent double bond (between 1 and 2) can stabilize the carbocation through resonance. The carbocation at carbon 3 can delocalize to carbon 2, forming a resonance-stabilized carbocation. Then Br⁻ attacks at the carbon with the positive charge. \n\nIf the carbocation is at carbon 2, then Br⁻ would attack there, leading to a bromide at carbon 2. The structure would be CH₂Br-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-OH? No, wait. Let me think again. \n\nOriginal structure is CH₂=CH-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃. After water leaves from the hydroxyl on carbon 3, the carbocation is at carbon 3. The adjacent double bond (between 1 and 2) can resonate to place the positive charge at carbon 2. So the resonance would give a carbocation at carbon 2. Then Br⁻ attacks at carbon 2, giving a bromide at carbon 2. The structure would be CH₂Br-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃? No, wait. Let me track the positions. \n\nOriginal structure: \n\n1: CH₂= \n2: CH- \n3: CH(OH)- \n4: CH₂- \n5: CH₂- \n6: CH₃ \n\nAfter substitution at 3, the product would have Br at 2. So the structure becomes CH₂Br-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃. But wait, the original double bond is between 1 and 2. If the H is added to carbon 1 and Br to carbon 2, then the double bond is gone. But in this case, if the substitution is at carbon 3, how does the double bond change? \n\nActually, if the hydroxyl on carbon 3 is replaced by Br, then the double bond between 1 and 2 remains. But the carbocation formation might lead to a shift. Wait, no. If the hydroxyl is on carbon 3, and we form a carbocation at carbon 3, and then resonance with the double bond between 1 and 2. \n\nWait, maybe the correct way is that the carbocation at carbon 3 (from the hydroxyl leaving) can resonate with the adjacent double bond. So the positive charge can move to carbon 2, making the structure CH₂=CH⁺-CH₂-... but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the original structure is CH₂=CH-CH(OH)-... When the hydroxyl leaves, forming a carbocation at carbon 3. The adjacent double bond can stabilize it by resonance. \n\nThe structure would be CH₂=CH-CH⁺-... but the positive charge is on carbon 3. The double bond between 1 and 2 can resonate to place the positive charge on carbon 2. So the resonance would look like CH₂⁺-CH-CH₂-... with a double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, that would be a resonance structure where the double bond is between 2 and 3, and the positive charge is on carbon 1. Hmm, I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the carbocation at carbon 3 can undergo hydride shifts or other rearrangements. But the most stable carbocation would be the one that is allylic (next to a double bond). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the HBr adds across the double bond. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Adding HBr would give either H on 1 and Br on 2 or vice versa. According to Markovnikov, the H would add to the less substituted carbon. Since the double bond is between 1 and 2, carbon 1 is CH₂ and carbon 2 is CH. Carbon 1 is less substituted (since it's a terminal carbon), so the H would add to carbon 1, and Br to carbon 2. The product would be CH₃-CHBr-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-OH. But wait, the hydroxyl is still on carbon 3. So the product would be CH₃-CHBr-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃? No, because the original hydroxyl is on carbon 3. Wait, the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃. Adding HBr across the double bond would give CH₃-CHBr-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃. But then the hydroxyl is still present. However, the question is about the product when HBr is added. \n\nBut in the presence of HBr, if the hydroxyl is also present, maybe the hydroxyl could be replaced by Br. But the options for product B are either (E)-1-bromohex-2-ene or 2-bromohexan-3-ol. \n\nWait, option B for product B is 2-bromohexan-3-ol. That would mean the hydroxyl is still on carbon 3 and a Br on carbon 2. Which is what we just thought. So if the HBr adds across the double bond, giving Br on 2 and keeping the hydroxyl on 3, then the product is 2-bromohexan-3-ol. \n\nAlternatively, if the substitution occurs at the hydroxyl group, leading to Br on 3. But the options don't have that. \n\nSo for product B, the correct product is 2-bromohexan-3-ol, which is option B and D. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: A = 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol, B = (E)-1-bromohex-2-ene \nOption B: A = 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene, B = 2-bromohexan-3-ol \nOption C: A = 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene, B = (E)-1-bromohex-2-ene \nOption D: A = 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol, B = 2-bromohexan-3-ol \n\nSo for product A, if the reaction leads to 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol (option A and D), and product B is 2-bromohexan-3-ol (option B and D), then the correct answer would be option D. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm again for product A. \n\nIn the first reaction, 5-isopropylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol + HBr → A. If the hydroxyl is replaced by Br, but the double bond is still present? Or if the HBr adds across the double bond, making the ring a cyclohexane with a Br at 3 and OH at 1. \n\nWait, earlier I thought that if HBr adds across the double bond, the double bond is consumed, so the ring becomes a cyclohexane (no double bond) with Br at 3 and OH at 1. So the product would be 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol. That's option A and D. \n\nIf the hydroxyl is replaced by Br without involving the double bond, then the double bond would still be present. But in that case, the product would be 1-bromo... but the options don't have that. \n\nTherefore, the correct product for A is 3-bromo-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol, and for B it's 2-bromohexan-3-ol. So the correct option is D. \n\nLet me just check if there's any other possibility. For product A, could the reaction be a substitution at the hydroxyl group leading to 1-bromo... but the options don't have that. The options have 3-bromo... So I think the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
