This effect is commonly experienced, for example, when a siren on an ambulance approaches and then passes by, causing the pitch to drop.\n\n---\n\nIn this scenario, a **400 Hz alarm** is **dropped** from a third-floor window and falls **away from the observer** (the student who dropped it). As the alarm falls, it accelerates due to gravity, meaning its **speed increases** over time as it moves away from the observer.\n\nThe Doppler effect for a **source moving away from a stationary observer** is described by the formula:\n\n$$\nf' = f \\cdot \\frac{v_{\\text{sound}}}{v_{\\text{sound}} + v_{\\text{source}}}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ f' $ is the **observed frequency**,\n- $ f $ is the **emitted frequency** (400 Hz),\n- $ v_{\\text{sound}} $ is the speed of sound in air,\n- $ v_{\\text{source}} $ is the speed of the source (the falling alarm).\n\nAs the alarm falls, $ v_{\\text{source}} $ increases, which **increases the denominator** of the fraction.

The question is about whether the measured frequency appears higher or lower than 400 Hz and how it changes as the alarm falls. The options are A through D, each combining two possibilities: higher or lower, and whether the frequency increases or decreases during the fall.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a sound source is moving relative to an observer, the Doppler effect comes into play. The Doppler effect causes a shift in the observed frequency. If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency increases, and if it's moving away, the frequency decreases. \n\nBut in this case, the alarm is being dropped from a window. So, the student is standing on the third floor, drops the alarm, and measures the frequency as it falls. Wait, but once it's dropped, the alarm is moving downward, away from the student. So, the source (the alarm) is moving away from the observer (the student). Therefore, the Doppler effect would cause the observed frequency to be lower than the actual frequency. \n\nBut wait, the student is the one who drops the alarm. So, if the alarm is falling away from the student, then the student would observe a lower frequency. However, as the alarm falls, it's accelerating due to gravity, so its speed is increasing. Since the speed of the source relative to the observer is increasing, the Doppler shift should become more pronounced over time. \n\nSo initially, when the alarm is just released, it's moving away from the student with some initial velocity (probably zero if just dropped), but as it falls, it speeds up. So the Doppler effect would cause the frequency to decrease more as the alarm falls faster. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking two things: what the measured frequency appears compared to 400 Hz, and whether the frequency increases or decreases as it falls. \n\nIf the alarm is moving away from the student, the observed frequency is lower than 400 Hz. And as it falls, it's moving away faster, so the observed frequency should keep decreasing. So the correct answer would be either C or D. Wait, C says \"appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls\", D says \"appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency increases as it falls\". Wait, no. Wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA: higher and increases\n\nB: higher and decreases\n\nC: lower and decreases\n\nD: lower and increases\n\nSo if the source is moving away, the observed frequency is lower than the actual. As the source accelerates away, the observed frequency would decrease further. So the frequency would start lower than 400 Hz and then get even lower. So the answer is C: appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, the student is measuring the frequency as the alarm falls. But the alarm is moving away from the student, so the Doppler effect would make the frequency lower. However, as the alarm falls, it's accelerating, so the speed at which it's moving away from the student is increasing. Therefore, the Doppler shift would become more significant, meaning the observed frequency would decrease further. So the measured frequency would start at 400 Hz when it's stationary, then as it starts moving away, it drops below 400 Hz, and as it falls faster, the frequency keeps decreasing. So the answer would be C: appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When the alarm is first dropped, it's not moving, so the frequency is 400 Hz. Then as it starts to fall, it begins to move away, so the frequency decreases. So the measured frequency is lower than 400 Hz and continues to decrease as the alarm accelerates. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nBut let me think again. The Doppler effect formula for a moving source is:\n\nf' = f * (v_sound) / (v_sound + v_source)\n\nWhere v_source is the velocity of the source moving away from the observer. So as v_source increases, the denominator increases, so f' decreases. So yes, as the alarm falls and its speed increases, the observed frequency f' decreases. Therefore, the frequency appears lower than 400 Hz and continues to decrease as it falls. So option C.\n\nBut I need to make sure there isn't another factor. For example, does the alarm itself change frequency as it falls? The problem states that the alarm has a frequency of 400 Hz, so assuming it's a constant frequency source, so the actual frequency doesn't change. The change is purely due to the Doppler effect because of the motion of the source.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
