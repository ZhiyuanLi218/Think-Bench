Let me recall what the Doppler effect is. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. It's commonly experienced when a siren passes by; the pitch sounds higher as it approaches and lower as it moves away.\n\nThe question is asking when there's NO perceived Doppler shift. So, in which scenario would the frequency detected be the same as the frequency emitted by the source?\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The source travels toward the stationary detector. If the source is moving towards a stationary detector, then the waves in front of the source get compressed, leading to a higher frequency detected. So there would be a Doppler shift here. So A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: The detector travels toward the stationary source. If the detector is moving towards a stationary source, the detector is intercepting more wavefronts per second, which also results in a higher detected frequency. So again, there's a Doppler shift. So B is not the answer.\n\nOption C: Both the source and detector travel in the same direction. Hmm. If they are moving in the same direction, the Doppler shift depends on their relative velocities. If they are moving at the same speed and direction, then their relative velocity is zero. In that case, there would be no Doppler shift. However, if they are moving in the same direction but at different speeds, then there would be a Doppler shift. The question doesn't specify their speeds, just that they are moving in the same direction. So maybe this is a possible scenario where there's no Doppler shift if their speeds are equal. But the question is phrased as \"is it possible that there is NO perceived Doppler shift?\" So if it's possible, even if not always, then C could be a candidate. But I need to check if the answer expects specific conditions or just the possibility.\n\nOption D: Both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, moving away from each other. In this case, the relative motion is away from each other, so the Doppler effect would result in a lower frequency. So there is a Doppler shift here. So D is not the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The key here is whether the relative motion between the source and the detector is zero. If the source and detector are moving in the same direction at the same speed, then their relative motion is zero. So even though they are both moving, since their relative velocity is zero, there's no Doppler shift. So in that case, option C could result in no Doppler shift. However, if they are moving in the same direction but at different speeds, then there would be a Doppler shift. The question is asking if it's possible that there is no shift, so as long as there's a scenario where C could result in no shift, then C is correct.\n\nBut wait, are there other possibilities? Let me check the other options again.\n\nA and B definitely involve relative motion towards each other, so Doppler shift upwards. D is moving away, so Doppler shift downwards. So only C could have zero if their speeds are equal. So the answer is C?\n\nBut wait, another thought. What if both the source and detector are moving in the same direction but at different speeds? Then there would be a Doppler shift. However, the question is phrased as \"is it possible that there is NO perceived Doppler shift?\" So if there exists at least one scenario under the given conditions where there's no shift, then that option is correct. Since in option C, if both are moving at the same speed and same direction, their relative velocity is zero, so no Doppler shift. Therefore, C is possible. Hence, the answer is C.\n\nBut let me also recall the formula for Doppler shift when both source and observer are moving. The general formula for sound is:\n\nf' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs)\n\nWhere:\n- f' is the observed frequency\n- f is the emitted frequency\n- v is the speed of sound\n- vo is the velocity of the observer towards the source\n- vs is the velocity of the source towards the observer\n\nIf both are moving in the same direction, say, the source is moving to the right at speed vs, and the observer is moving to the right at speed vo. Depending on their directions relative to each other, the formula would adjust. If they are moving in the same direction, then if the observer is moving towards the source (if the source is ahead), or away. Wait, maybe I need to think about their relative motion.\n\nSuppose the source and observer are moving in the same direction at the same speed. Let's say they are both moving to the right at speed u. Then, from the perspective of the medium (air), the source is moving at u, and the observer is moving at u. The Doppler shift formula would be:\n\nIf the observer is moving towards the source (but since they are moving in the same direction, if the observer is behind the source, moving towards it? Wait, if they are moving in the same direction at the same speed, they are maintaining a constant distance. So the observer is neither approaching nor receding from the source. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift. So yes, in this case, option C is possible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. But let me check again if there's another scenario where even if moving in opposite directions, maybe if they are moving at certain speeds? But no, if they are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is adding up, so there would be a Doppler shift. Unless they are moving in opposite directions but with velocities that somehow cancel out? Wait, no. If they are moving away from each other, the Doppler shift is definitely present. If they are moving towards each other, also a shift. So only when their relative velocity is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. However, let me check if there's another possibility. For example, if the source and detector are moving perpendicular to each other? But that's not one of the options here. The options given are A, B, C, D. So in the given options, only C allows for the possibility of zero relative velocity. Therefore, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
