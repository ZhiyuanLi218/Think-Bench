Each of them is going to order one dish. The question is asking how many different combinations of meals they can order if they refuse to order the same dish. Also, it's specified that the order matters, meaning that if Yann orders chicken and Camille orders fish, that's different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me recall some combinatorics principles. When dealing with combinations and permutations, it's important to know whether the order matters and whether repetition is allowed. In this case, repetition isn't allowed because they refuse to order the same dish. Also, since it matters who orders what, the order does matter here. So, this sounds like a permutation problem without repetition.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If there are 10 items on the menu, and each person orders one dish, but they can't order the same one. So, for the first person, say Yann, he has 10 choices. Then, once Yann has chosen his dish, Camille can't choose that same one, so she has 9 remaining choices. Therefore, the total number of combinations would be 10 multiplied by 9, which is 90. Is that right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as selecting two different dishes and then assigning them to Yann and Camille. If I first choose two different dishes from 10, that would be combination, which is C(10, 2). Then, since the order matters (who gets which dish), I need to multiply by 2! to account for the permutations. So, C(10, 2) is 45, and multiplying by 2 gives 90. So, same answer. So that seems to check out.\n\nBut let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything. Let's take the first approach. Yann has 10 options. For each of those options, Camille has 9 options left. So, using the multiplication principle, 10 * 9 = 90. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of all possible combinations without any restrictions, it would be 10 * 10 = 100, since each can choose independently. But then we have to subtract the cases where they order the same dish. There are 10 such cases (both order dish 1, both order dish 2, ..., both order dish 10). Therefore, total combinations where they don't order the same dish would be 100 - 10 = 90. Again, same answer. So that's a good consistency check.\n\nAnother way to think about permutations: when selecting r items from n where order matters and no repetition, the formula is nPr = n! / (n - r)!. In this case, n = 10, r = 2. So 10P2 = 10! / (10 - 2)! = 10! / 8! = 10 * 9 * 8! / 8! = 10 * 9 = 90. Yep, that's the same result again.\n\nSo, all different approaches lead me to 90. Therefore, I think the answer is 90. But just to make sure I haven't overlooked something. Let me think if there are any constraints or nuances in the problem that I might have missed.\n\nThe problem says \"different combinations of meals\" and specifies that it does matter who orders what. So, combinations in the general sense, but since order matters here, it's permutations. If order didn't matter, it would be combinations, so C(10, 2) = 45. But since Yann and Camille are distinct individuals, and swapping their dishes counts as a different combination, we need to consider permutations. Therefore, 90 is correct.\n\nAnother check: suppose there are 2 items on the menu. Then, how many combinations? If they can't order the same, then Yann has 2 choices, Camille has 1, so 2*1=2. Which is correct: if the dishes are A and B, then Yann-A and Camille-B, or Yann-B and Camille-A. Indeed 2, which is 2P2=2. If there are 3 items, then 3*2=6 permutations. Which would be all the possible ordered pairs without repetition: (A,B), (A,C), (B,A), (B,C), (C,A), (C,B). 6 in total, which is correct. Therefore, the formula holds in smaller cases. So scaling up, with 10 items, it's 10*9=90.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident the answer is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different combinations of meals they can order is \\boxed{90}.\n</think>"}
