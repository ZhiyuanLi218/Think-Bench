Substituting $ I = \\frac{V}{R} $ into $ P = IV $, we get:\n\n$$\nP = \\left(\\frac{V}{R}\\right)V = \\frac{V^2}{R}\n$$\n\nThis formula is especially useful when the voltage is constant, as in the case of an ideal battery.\n\n---\n\n### Applying the Change in Resistance\n\nSuppose the initial resistance is $ R $. Then the initial power is:\n\n$$\nP_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{V^2}{R}\n$$\n\nNow, if the resistance is doubled (i.e., becomes $ 2R $), the new power becomes:\n\n$$\nP_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{V^2}{2R} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{V^2}{R} = \\frac{1}{2} P_{\\text{initial}}\n$$\n\nThus, the total power dissipated in the circuit is **halved** when the resistance is doubled.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nSince the battery is ideal and the voltage remains constant, the only factor affecting the power is the resistance. Doubling the resistance reduces the power by half.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about an ideal battery with a constant voltage V supplying current to a circuit with total resistance R. Then if we double R, what happens to the total power dissipated by the circuit? The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas related to power in electrical circuits. I remember that power can be calculated in a few different ways depending on what variables you know. The most common ones are P = IV (power equals current times voltage), P = I²R (current squared times resistance), and P = V²/R (voltage squared over resistance). Since the battery has a constant voltage, maybe the third formula, P = V²/R, is the one to use here because V is constant.\n\nLet me think. If the voltage is constant and the resistance changes, then power is inversely proportional to resistance. So if R is doubled, the power should be halved. That would mean the answer is C: It will be halved. But wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, using Ohm's Law. The original current would be I = V/R. So original power is P = IV = (V/R)*V = V²/R. If R is doubled, the new current is I' = V/(2R). Then the new power is I'V = (V/(2R)) * V = V²/(2R) which is half the original power. So yes, that seems to confirm it. So the power is halved when resistance is doubled.\n\nBut wait, another way: using P = I²R. Original power is (V/R)² * R = V²/R² * R = V²/R. If R is doubled, then new power is (V/(2R))² * 2R = V²/(4R²) * 2R = V²/(2R). Again, same result. So regardless of the formula used, the power halves. So answer C.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no trick here. The question says \"total power dissipated by the circuit\". Since the battery is ideal (so no internal resistance), all the power is dissipated in the circuit's resistance. So yes, the formulas apply directly. If R is doubled, power halves. So answer C.\n\nHmm. But wait, sometimes people get confused between power formulas. For example, if you have P = IV, and if you think that increasing resistance would decrease current, but since voltage is fixed, how does that affect power? Let's see. Original current I = V/R. When R doubles, current becomes I' = V/(2R) = I/2. So current is halved. Then power P = IV. Original power was IV. New power is (I/2)*V = IV/2. So again, half. So same conclusion.\n\nSo all approaches lead to the same answer. So I think the answer is C: It will be halved.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
