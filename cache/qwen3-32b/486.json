Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the paramagnetic coupling term refers to the Zeeman effect, right? The Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. Since the magnetic field is along the z-axis (Oz), it's the normal Zeeman effect if we're considering orbital angular momentum only. But wait, the problem mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m, so maybe it's the orbital part. The paramagnetic term usually relates to the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moment of the atom, which for orbital angular momentum is given by the Zeeman Hamiltonian.\n\nThe Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For orbital angular momentum, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = - (e/(2m_e c)) L, where L is the angular momentum operator. But in SI units, I think the formula might be different. Let me check. The magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ = - (e/(2m_e)) L, because in SI units, the formula is μ = γ L, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For orbital motion, γ = -e/(2m_e). So the Zeeman Hamiltonian would be H = -μ·B = (e/(2m_e)) L·B. Since B is along the z-axis, this simplifies to H = (eB/(2m_e)) L_z. And since L_z is ħ m, then H = (eB/(2m_e)) ħ m. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be (eBħ m)/(2m_e).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"paramagnetic coupling term\". Is this the correct expression? Let me confirm. The paramagnetic term is the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field. Yes, that's the Zeeman term. So ⟨H⟩ is proportional to m, B, and ħ. Since m is small, maybe m=1 or something? The problem says \"small values of m\", so maybe m is around 1.\n\nNow, the transition energy ΔE corresponds to the energy difference between two states that the atom transitions between, which is related to the wavelength λ given. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, so the transition energy ΔE would be approximately hc/λ. Wait, but actually, ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels, and when an atom emits or absorbs a photon with wavelength λ, then ΔE = hc/λ. So yes, that's right. So I need to calculate ΔE = hc/λ, and compare it to ⟨H⟩.\n\nSo let's compute both quantities.\n\nFirst, compute ΔE. Given λ = 0.4861 micrometers. Let me convert that to meters. 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so λ = 0.4861e-6 m. Then ΔE = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that:\n\nΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 0.4861e-6 m.\n\nLet me calculate the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m:\n\nΔE ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 1.9878 / 0.4861 * 1e-19 ≈ Let me compute 1.9878 / 0.4861 ≈ 4.089. So ΔE ≈ 4.089e-19 J.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to convert this to electron volts because the other term might be in eV as well. Let me recall that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE in eV is 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Let me check with exact numbers. Let me recalculate ΔE:\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, since it's defined now), c = 299792458 m/s, but approximating as 3e8 m/s is fine for order of magnitude.\n\nSo ΔE ≈ (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 6.626 * 3 / 0.4861 * 1e-34 * 1e8 / 1e-6.\n\nWait, exponents: 1e-34 * 1e8 / 1e-6 = 1e(-34 + 8 + 6) = 1e-20? Wait:\n\nWait, denominator is 0.4861e-6 m, so it's 1e-34 * 3e8 divided by 0.4861e-6 = (6.626 * 3 / 0.4861) * 1e-34 * 1e8 / 1e-6.\n\nCompute exponents: 1e-34 * 1e8 is 1e-26, divided by 1e-6 is 1e-20. So 6.626 * 3 / 0.4861 ≈ 6.626 * 6.17 ≈ Let me compute 6.626 * 3 = 19.878, divided by 0.4861 ≈ 19.878 / 0.4861 ≈ 40.89. So ΔE ≈ 40.89e-20 J. Wait, 40.89e-20 J is 4.089e-19 J, which is what I had before. Converting to eV: 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Okay, so ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.\n\nNow, compute ⟨H⟩, the paramagnetic coupling term. As I mentioned earlier, ⟨H⟩ = (eBħm)/(2m_e). Let's note the constants:\n\ne = elementary charge = 1.602e-19 C\n\nB = 1 T\n\nħ = reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nm_e = electron mass ≈ 9.10938356e-31 kg\n\nm is the magnetic quantum number, which is small. Since m is small, maybe m=1? The problem says \"small values of m\", so perhaps m is 1 or 0? But since we are talking about a coupling term, maybe m is 1? Let me assume m=1 for the order of magnitude estimate.\n\nSo plug in the numbers:\n\n⟨H⟩ = (1.602e-19 C * 1 T * 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1) / (2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg)\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.602e-19 * 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 1.602 * 1.05457 ≈ 1.690e-53 C·T·J·s.\n\nWait, units: T is kg/(s·C), because magnetic field unit Tesla can be expressed in SI base units as kg/(s²·A), and since current I is in Amperes (C/s?), Wait, let me recall the units. The Tesla is defined such that 1 T = 1 N/(A·m). Also, 1 N = 1 kg·m/s². So 1 T = kg/(s²·A). Since 1 A = 1 C/s, then T = kg/(s²*(C/s)) ) = kg/(s·C). Yes, so T = kg/(s·C). Therefore, the units of e*B is C*(kg/(s·C)) ) = kg/s.\n\nThen, ħ has units of J·s = (kg·m²/s²)*s = kg·m²/s.\n\nSo multiplying e*B*ħ: (kg/s)*(kg·m²/s) ) = kg²·m²/s².\n\nDividing by m_e (kg) gives kg·m²/s², which is energy (Joules). So the units check out. Good.\n\nSo going back to the calculation:\n\nNumerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 1.602 * 1.05457 ≈ 1.690, so ≈ 1.690e-53 C·T·J·s? Wait, no, the numerical value is 1.602e-19 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ 1.690e-53 (C * J·s). Wait, but with the units, it's kg/s * kg·m²/s. Let me not get bogged down with units, just compute the number.\n\nSo numerator ≈ 1.602 * 1.05457 ≈ 1.690, times 1e-19 * 1e-34 = 1e-53.\n\nDenominator is 2 * 9.10938356e-31 ≈ 1.8218767e-30.\n\nTherefore, ⟨H⟩ ≈ 1.690e-53 / 1.8218767e-30 ≈ (1.690 / 1.8218767) * 1e-23 ≈ 0.927 * 1e-23 ≈ 9.27e-24 J.\n\nConvert this to eV by dividing by 1.602e-19 J/eV:\n\n9.27e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV ≈ 5.79 × 10^-5 eV.\n\nSo ⟨H⟩ ≈ 5.79 × 10^-5 eV, and ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV. Comparing these two, ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. Therefore, the answer should be option A: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, ΔE calculation:\n\nλ = 0.4861 micrometers = 486.1 nm, which is actually the wavelength for the Balmer alpha line (H-alpha), which is between n=2 and n=3 in hydrogen. The energy difference for H-alpha is indeed around 2.55 eV. So that seems correct.\n\nNow for ⟨H⟩:\n\nI used ⟨H⟩ = (eBħm)/(2m_e). Let me check the formula again. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for orbital angular momentum is μ = - (e/(2m_e)) L. Therefore, H = -μ·B = (e/(2m_e)) L·B. Since B is along z-axis, H = (eB/(2m_e)) L_z. The expectation value ⟨L_z⟩ is ħ m. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = (eB/(2m_e)) * ħ m. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = (eBħm)/(2m_e). So that formula is correct.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\ne = 1.602e-19 C\n\nB = 1 T\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nm_e = 9.10938356e-31 kg\n\nm = 1 (assuming)\n\nTherefore:\n\n⟨H⟩ = (1.602e-19 * 1 * 1.0545718e-34 * 1) / (2 * 9.10938356e-31)\n\nLet me compute the numerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.0545718e-34 = approx 1.602 * 1.05457 ≈ 1.690, times 1e-53.\n\nDenominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 ≈ 1.8218e-30.\n\nSo ⟨H⟩ ≈ 1.690e-53 / 1.8218e-30 ≈ 9.27e-24 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 9.27e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. Yes, that's 0.0000579 eV.\n\nComparing with ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV, so ⟨H⟩ is about 1e-4 eV vs ΔE of ~2.5 eV. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. So the order of magnitude difference is about 1e-4 vs 1, so 4 orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ << ΔE. So the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I missed any factors. For example, sometimes the Zeeman effect is given as μ_B B m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Let me recall that the Bohr magneton μ_B is eħ/(2m_e). So indeed, ⟨H⟩ = μ_B B m. So ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * B * m.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T. Therefore, for B=1 T and m=1, ⟨H⟩ = 9.27e-24 J, which is exactly what I calculated. Converting that to eV, as above, gives ~5.79e-5 eV. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is on the order of 1e-4 eV, while the transition energy is ~2.5 eV. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. Hence, option A is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The Zeeman splitting is usually much smaller than the transition energy unless the magnetic field is extremely strong (like in astrophysical contexts). For a 1 Tesla field, which is a laboratory-scale magnetic field, the Zeeman splitting is indeed tiny compared to the transition energies in the visible spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
