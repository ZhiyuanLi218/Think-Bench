The tetrahedron has side length 2. Let me start by recalling some properties of a regular tetrahedron. All edges are equal, so every edge is length 2. Each face is an equilateral triangle. Now, the problem mentions a plane that's parallel to edges AB and CD and lies halfway between them. I need to visualize this. \n\nFirst, let me try to sketch or imagine the tetrahedron. Let me label the vertices A, B, C, D. In a regular tetrahedron, every pair of opposite edges are skew lines, right? Wait, but the problem says the plane is parallel to edges AB and CD. But AB and CD are skew lines, not parallel. Wait, but maybe in some projection they can be considered parallel? Or maybe there is a plane that can be parallel to both? Hmm, maybe I need to think about the direction of the edges AB and CD. \n\nLet me recall that in a regular tetrahedron, opposite edges are not only skew but also they are orthogonal? Wait, no, in a regular tetrahedron, the angle between any two edges meeting at a vertex is arccos(1/3), but for skew edges... Hmm, maybe they are not orthogonal. Maybe I need to think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron will help. \n\nYes, coordinates might be a good approach here. Let me assign coordinates to the regular tetrahedron. There's a standard coordinate system for a regular tetrahedron. For example, one can place the vertices at (1,1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1), scaled appropriately. But maybe I need to adjust them so that the edge length is 2. Let me check.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the distance between (1,1,1) and (-1,-1,1) is sqrt[(-2)^2 + (-2)^2 + 0^2] = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). So if I want edge length 2, I need to scale these coordinates down. Let me denote the coordinates as (a, a, a), (-a, -a, a), etc. Then the distance between (a,a,a) and (-a,-a,a) is sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2a)^2 + 0] = sqrt(8a²) = 2√2 a. So if I want this to be 2, then 2√2 a = 2 => a = 1/√2. Therefore, the coordinates would be (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2), etc. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use another coordinate system where calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe place one vertex at the origin, another along the x-axis, another in the xy-plane, and the fourth somewhere in 3D space. Let me try that. Let me denote vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Let me take vertex B at (2, 0, 0), since the edge length is 2. Then, vertex C can be in the xy-plane. Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, coordinates of C can be (1, √3, 0). Then, the fourth vertex D is somewhere above the xy-plane. Let me find coordinates of D. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal. So the distance from D to A, B, C should be 2. Let me denote D as (x, y, z). Then:\n\nDistance from D to A: sqrt(x² + y² + z²) = 2\n\nDistance from D to B: sqrt((x - 2)² + y² + z²) = 2\n\nDistance from D to C: sqrt((x - 1)² + (y - √3)² + z²) = 2\n\nSo let me square these equations:\n\n1. x² + y² + z² = 4\n\n2. (x - 2)² + y² + z² = 4\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x - 2)² - x² = 0 => x² -4x +4 -x² = -4x +4 = 0 => x = 1.\n\nSo x = 1. Now, substitute x = 1 into equation 1 and 3.\n\nEquation 1 becomes 1 + y² + z² = 4 => y² + z² = 3.\n\nEquation 3 becomes (1 - 1)² + (y - √3)² + z² = 4 => 0 + (y - √3)² + z² = 4.\n\nExpanding (y - √3)^2: y² - 2√3 y + 3 + z² = 4.\n\nBut from equation 1, y² + z² = 3. Substitute into above:\n\n3 - 2√3 y + 3 = 4 => 6 - 2√3 y = 4 => -2√3 y = -2 => y = 1/√3.\n\nSo y = 1/√3. Then from y² + z² = 3:\n\n(1/√3)^2 + z² = 3 => 1/3 + z² = 3 => z² = 3 - 1/3 = 8/3 => z = ±2√(2/3) = ±(2√6)/3. Since the tetrahedron is above the xy-plane, we take the positive value: z = 2√6 / 3.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (1, 1/√3, 2√6 / 3). Let me check the distance from D to C, which is supposed to be 2. Coordinates of C are (1, √3, 0). So difference in coordinates:\n\nx: 1 - 1 = 0\n\ny: 1/√3 - √3 = 1/√3 - 3/√3 = -2/√3\n\nz: 2√6 / 3 - 0 = 2√6 / 3\n\nThen distance squared is 0 + ( -2/√3 )² + (2√6 / 3)^2 = 4/3 + (4*6)/9 = 4/3 + 24/9 = 4/3 + 8/3 = 12/3 = 4. Square root is 2. Correct. So coordinates are good.\n\nSo now, we have coordinates for all four vertices:\n\nA: (0, 0, 0)\n\nB: (2, 0, 0)\n\nC: (1, √3, 0)\n\nD: (1, 1/√3, 2√6 / 3)\n\nNow, the problem mentions edges AB and CD. Let me note that AB is from (0,0,0) to (2,0,0). CD is from C: (1, √3, 0) to D: (1, 1/√3, 2√6 / 3). \n\nNow, the plane is parallel to AB and CD and lies halfway between them. First, I need to figure out what this plane is. Since the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, its direction vectors should be parallel to AB and CD. Also, since it's halfway between AB and CD, I need to find the position of the plane.\n\nBut first, maybe I need to find the distance between AB and CD, then take the plane halfway. However, AB and CD are skew lines. The distance between skew lines can be computed, and then the plane is halfway in that distance. Alternatively, maybe there is another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, it must contain a line that is parallel to AB and a line parallel to CD. However, since it's cutting the tetrahedron, perhaps the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is a quadrilateral? Or maybe a triangle? Wait, if the plane is cutting between AB and CD, then maybe it intersects other edges?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parametrize the plane. Let me think. Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, then its normal vector is perpendicular to both direction vectors of AB and CD. Let me compute the direction vectors of AB and CD.\n\nDirection vector of AB is B - A = (2, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 0) = (2, 0, 0). So direction vector AB is (1, 0, 0) after normalizing.\n\nDirection vector of CD is D - C = (1, 1/√3, 2√6 / 3) - (1, √3, 0) = (0, 1/√3 - √3, 2√6 / 3 - 0) = (0, (1/√3 - 3/√3), 2√6 / 3) = (0, -2/√3, 2√6 / 3). Let me simplify this vector. Let me write it as (0, -2/√3, 2√6 / 3). Let me rationalize the denominators if needed, but maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, since the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, its normal vector should be perpendicular to both direction vectors AB and CD. Therefore, the normal vector n is the cross product of AB direction vector and CD direction vector.\n\nLet me compute that cross product. Let me denote AB direction vector as u = (1, 0, 0). CD direction vector as v = (0, -2/√3, 2√6 / 3). Then cross product n = u × v.\n\nCalculating cross product:\n\n|i   j   k|\n|1   0   0|\n|0 -2/√3 2√6/3|\n\nWhich is i*(0*2√6/3 - 0*(-2/√3)) - j*(1*2√6/3 - 0*0) + k*(1*(-2/√3) - 0*0)\n\nSimplify:\n\ni*(0 - 0) - j*(2√6 / 3 - 0) + k*(-2/√3 - 0) = (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3)\n\nTherefore, normal vector n is (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3). We can simplify this by multiplying by 3 to eliminate denominators: (0, -2√6, -2√3). But maybe we can just use this as is.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the plane can be written as n ⋅ (X - P) = 0, where P is a point on the plane. However, we need to determine the plane's position. Since it's halfway between AB and CD, perhaps we need to find the midpoint between AB and CD? But since AB and CD are skew lines, the concept of midpoint isn't straightforward. Instead, we need to find the plane that is parallel to both AB and CD and lies halfway in terms of distance between them.\n\nThe distance between two skew lines can be calculated using the formula:\n\nDistance = |(b - a) ⋅ (u × v)| / |u × v|,\n\nwhere a and b are points on the two lines, and u and v are direction vectors of the lines.\n\nLet me apply this formula. Let me take point A (on AB) as (0, 0, 0) and point C (on CD) as (1, √3, 0). Then vector b - a is vector AC = (1, √3, 0). The direction vectors u = AB direction (1, 0, 0) and v = CD direction (0, -2/√3, 2√6 / 3). Earlier, we computed u × v = (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3). Let me compute |u × v|:\n\n|n| = sqrt( (0)^2 + (-2√6 / 3)^2 + (-2 / √3)^2 ) = sqrt( (24 / 9) + (4 / 3) ) = sqrt( (8/3) + (4/3) ) = sqrt(12 / 3) = sqrt(4) = 2. Nice, so the magnitude of the cross product is 2. \n\nThen, the distance between AB and CD is |(AC) ⋅ n| / |n|. Wait, but AC is vector from a to b? Wait, the formula is |(b - a) ⋅ (u × v)| / |u × v|. Here, (b - a) is vector from A to C, which is (1, √3, 0). Then, compute (1, √3, 0) ⋅ (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3) = 1*0 + √3*(-2√6 / 3) + 0*(-2 / √3) = -2√18 / 3 = -2*(3√2)/3 = -2√2. Taking absolute value, so | -2√2 | = 2√2. Then divide by |u × v| = 2, so distance is 2√2 / 2 = √2. Therefore, the distance between AB and CD is √2. Therefore, the plane is halfway between them, so at distance √2 / 2 from each.\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the plane. Since the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, and lies halfway between them. How to find its equation?\n\nOne approach is to find a point that is halfway between AB and CD. Since the distance between AB and CD is √2, the plane is at distance √2 / 2 from each. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the plane.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the normal vector n = (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3), we can write the plane equation as:\n\nn ⋅ (X - P) = 0, where P is a point on the plane. To find P, we can take a point that is halfway between AB and CD. However, since AB and CD are skew lines, there isn't a unique midpoint, but there is a line of points that are at equal distance from both lines. However, since we know the distance from the plane to each line is √2 / 2, maybe we can find such a point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize a line that is perpendicular to both AB and CD, and then take the midpoint along that line. Since AB and CD are skew lines, they have a unique common perpendicular line. The direction of this common perpendicular is given by the cross product u × v, which we already calculated as (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3). Let me denote this direction vector as n. Therefore, the common perpendicular line can be parametrized by moving from AB in the direction of n until intersecting CD.\n\nAlternatively, since we already have the distance between AB and CD as √2, and we need the plane halfway, so moving √2 / 2 from AB towards CD along the common perpendicular.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can take a point on AB and move it halfway towards CD along the common perpendicular direction. Let me try this.\n\nTake a point on AB. Let me take point A, which is (0, 0, 0). The direction of the common perpendicular is n. However, n is (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3). But we need a unit vector in that direction. Since |n| = 2, as we found earlier, the unit vector is n / 2 = (0, -√6 / 3, -1 / √3). Therefore, moving from A in this direction by distance √2 / 2 gives us the point P on the plane.\n\nSo displacement vector is (unit vector) * (√2 / 2) = (0, -√6 / 3 * √2 / 2, -1 / √3 * √2 / 2). Let me compute components:\n\nFirst component: 0.\n\nSecond component: -√6 * √2 / (3 * 2) = -√12 / 6 = - (2√3) / 6 = -√3 / 3.\n\nThird component: -√2 / (2√3) = -√6 / 6. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, -1 / √3 * √2 / 2 = -√2 / (2√3) = multiply numerator and denominator by √3: -√6 / 6. Yes.\n\nTherefore, displacement vector is (0, -√3 / 3, -√6 / 6). Therefore, the point P is A + displacement = (0 + 0, 0 - √3 / 3, 0 - √6 / 6) = (0, -√3 / 3, -√6 / 6). However, this point is supposed to lie on the plane. Let me check if this is correct.\n\nBut wait, moving from AB towards CD along the common perpendicular. However, AB is from A(0,0,0) to B(2,0,0). The direction of the common perpendicular is towards CD. However, the coordinates of P we found are (0, -√3 / 3, -√6 / 6). But the original tetrahedron is above the xy-plane? Wait, point D has z-coordinate positive. But point P here has negative z-coordinate? That seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake here. Because if we move from AB towards CD, which is above the xy-plane, then the direction should be upwards? But according to our calculation, the unit vector is (0, -√6 / 3, -1 / √3). The z-component is negative. That suggests moving downward? That seems contradictory. Maybe the direction is actually opposite? Maybe I took the cross product in the wrong order?\n\nEarlier, we computed n = u × v, where u is AB direction (1,0,0) and v is CD direction (0, -2/√3, 2√6 / 3). The cross product u × v gave us (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3). If we had taken v × u, it would be the negative. Maybe the direction is actually opposite? Let me check.\n\nIf we take the vector from AB to CD, we need to see the direction of the common perpendicular. Let me think. The cross product u × v is direction of n. The formula for distance between lines is |(b - a) ⋅ n| / |n|. In our case, we had (b - a) ⋅ n = -2√2, which was negative. The absolute value was 2√2. Therefore, the actual direction of the common perpendicular from AB to CD is in the direction of n if we take the positive scalar. But since (b - a) ⋅ n is negative, maybe the direction from AB to CD is opposite to n? Therefore, perhaps I should have taken the opposite direction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have used a different point. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula for the distance is |(b - a) ⋅ (u × v)| / |u × v|. The sign of (b - a) ⋅ (u × v) depends on orientation. However, since we are moving from AB towards CD, we need to take the direction such that moving from AB in that direction reaches CD. Since (b - a) ⋅ n was negative, that suggests that the vector from AB to CD has a negative dot product with n, meaning that the direction from AB to CD is opposite to n. Therefore, the unit vector in the direction from AB to CD is -n / |n| = -n / 2. Therefore, the unit vector is (0, √6 / 3, 1 / √3). Therefore, moving from AB towards CD is in direction (0, √6 / 3, 1 / √3). Therefore, displacement vector should be (unit vector) * (√2 / 2). Let me recalculate:\n\nUnit vector: (0, √6 / 3, 1 / √3)\n\nMultiply by √2 / 2:\n\nSecond component: √6 / 3 * √2 / 2 = √12 / 6 = 2√3 / 6 = √3 / 3\n\nThird component: 1 / √3 * √2 / 2 = √2 / (2√3) = √6 / 6\n\nTherefore displacement vector is (0, √3 / 3, √6 / 6). Therefore, starting from point A (0, 0, 0), moving in this direction by distance √2 / 2 gives us point P = (0, 0 + √3 / 3, 0 + √6 / 6) = (0, √3 / 3, √6 / 6). \n\nLet me check if this point lies on the plane halfway between AB and CD. Also, since we are moving from AB towards CD by half the distance between them, this should be correct. Let me verify the distance from this point to AB and to CD.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to just use this point P to write the equation of the plane. Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, and contains point P, then its equation can be written using the normal vector n (but we need to be careful with direction). Wait, earlier, we had n as u × v = (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3). However, since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the normal vector should still be n. Wait, but if we move in the direction of the common perpendicular, then the plane equation can be constructed with that normal vector.\n\nAlternatively, since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, and passes through P, then the plane equation is n ⋅ (X - P) = 0. Wait, but n was computed as u × v. However, since we had to reverse the direction for the displacement, maybe the normal vector is actually pointing in the opposite direction? Let me check.\n\nThe normal vector n = u × v = (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3). If we take the plane equation n ⋅ (X - P) = 0, then substituting P into the equation would give 0. Let me check if P satisfies this. Let me compute n ⋅ (P - some point on AB). Let me take point A (0,0,0) on AB. Then vector from A to P is (0, √3 / 3, √6 / 6). Then n ⋅ (P - A) = (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3) ⋅ (0, √3 / 3, √6 / 6) = 0*0 + (-2√6 / 3)(√3 / 3) + (-2 / √3)(√6 / 6).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nSecond term: (-2√6 / 3)(√3 / 3) = -2√18 / 9 = -2*(3√2)/9 = -6√2 / 9 = -2√2 / 3.\n\nThird term: (-2 / √3)(√6 / 6) = -2√6 / (6√3) = -√6 / (3√3) = -√(6/3)/3 = -√2 / 3.\n\nTherefore total is -2√2 / 3 - √2 / 3 = -√2. Therefore, n ⋅ (P - A) = -√2 ≠ 0. Therefore, this suggests that P does not lie on the plane with normal vector n? Wait, but we were supposed to have the plane parallel to AB and CD. Maybe there is confusion here. Wait, the plane is parallel to AB and CD, so it should have normal vector n = u × v. But if we have a point P that is halfway between AB and CD, then the plane containing P and parallel to AB and CD would be the desired plane. But according to the calculation, n ⋅ (P - A) is not zero. Therefore, perhaps my calculation is wrong. \n\nWait, maybe the plane equation is not n ⋅ (X - P) = 0? Wait, if the plane is parallel to AB and CD, then its normal vector is perpendicular to both AB and CD, which is n. Therefore, the plane equation should be n ⋅ X = d for some constant d. To find d, plug in point P. Therefore, n ⋅ P = d. Let me compute n ⋅ P. \n\nPoint P is (0, √3 / 3, √6 / 6). n is (0, -2√6 / 3, -2 / √3). Therefore:\n\nn ⋅ P = 0*0 + (-2√6 / 3)(√3 / 3) + (-2 / √3)(√6 / 6) = same as before: -2√2 / 3 - √2 / 3 = -√2. Therefore, plane equation is n ⋅ X = -√2. Therefore, 0*x + (-2√6 / 3)y + (-2 / √3)z = -√2. Multiply both sides by -1 to make it look nicer: (2√6 / 3)y + (2 / √3)z = √2. Maybe simplify further. Let me rationalize denominators:\n\nMultiply all terms by √3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2√6 / 3 * √3 * y + 2 / √3 * √3 * z = √2 * √3\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: 2 * √(6*3) / 3 * y = 2 * √18 / 3 * y = 2*(3√2)/3 * y = 2√2 y\n\nSecond term: 2 * z\n\nRight side: √6\n\nTherefore, the equation simplifies to 2√2 y + 2 z = √6. Dividing both sides by 2: √2 y + z = √6 / 2.\n\nSo plane equation is √2 y + z = √6 / 2.\n\nLet me check if this plane is indeed halfway between AB and CD. For example, take a point on AB, say A(0,0,0). Plug into left side: √2*0 + 0 = 0. The distance from A to the plane is |0 - √6 / 2| / sqrt( (√2)^2 + 1^2 ) = | -√6 / 2 | / sqrt(2 + 1) = (√6 / 2) / √3 = (√6 / 2) / √3 = √(6)/ (2√3) = √2 / 2. Which is correct, as it should be half the distance between AB and CD. Similarly, take a point on CD, say point C(1, √3, 0). Plug into left side: √2*(√3) + 0 = √6. The distance from point C to the plane is |√6 - √6 / 2| / sqrt( (√2)^2 + 1^2 ) = |√6 / 2| / √3 = same as before √2 / 2. Correct. Therefore, the plane equation is correct: √2 y + z = √6 / 2.\n\nNow, with this plane equation, we need to find the surface area of one of the pieces. The original tetrahedron has surface area 4*(area of face). Each face is an equilateral triangle with side 2. Area of equilateral triangle is (√3 / 4)*a² = √3 / 4 * 4 = √3. Therefore, total surface area of tetrahedron is 4√3. However, when we cut the tetrahedron with the plane, each piece will have some original surface area plus the area of the new face created by the cut. However, the problem says \"surface area of one of these pieces\". Depending on which piece, the surface area would be different. Since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, probably one piece is closer to AB and the other to CD. But since the question says \"the plane... lying halfway between them cuts ABCD into two pieces\", so each piece's surface area would include parts of the original surface area and the new cut surface.\n\nBut the problem says \"surface area of one of these pieces\". Since the problem doesn't specify which one, but given the symmetry, maybe both pieces have the same surface area? Wait, no, because cutting a tetrahedron with a plane doesn't necessarily produce two congruent pieces. However, since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, perhaps the two pieces are congruent? Maybe not. Wait, a regular tetrahedron has a lot of symmetry, but depending on the cut, maybe they are congruent. However, since AB and CD are skew, maybe not. Let me check. Suppose we have a regular tetrahedron, and cut it halfway between two skew edges. Due to the symmetry, maybe the two pieces are congruent? Maybe yes. For example, there's a symmetry swapping AB with CD. Therefore, maybe the two pieces are congruent, so their surface areas are equal. Therefore, the problem is asking for the surface area of one piece, which would be half of the original surface area plus the area of the new face. Wait, but not exactly, because when you cut the tetrahedron, each piece loses some original faces and gains the new face. Wait, no, each piece retains some of the original faces and gains the new face. Therefore, the total surface area of each piece is (original surface area of tetrahedron / 2 + area of the new face)? Not necessarily, since the original surface area is distributed between the two pieces. For example, if the cut goes through some faces, then each piece will have parts of the original surface area. But in this case, since the plane is cutting between AB and CD, which are skew edges, the plane might intersect other edges of the tetrahedron, thereby creating a new face and modifying the original faces.\n\nTherefore, to compute the surface area of one of the pieces, I need to figure out:\n\n1. Which original faces are entirely on one side of the plane (and thus contribute fully to the surface area of that piece).\n\n2. Which original faces are intersected by the plane (and thus contribute partially to the surface area of each piece).\n\n3. The area of the new face created by the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron.\n\nGiven that, let me try to find the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron. The plane cuts through the tetrahedron, creating a section. Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the intersection should be a quadrilateral? Because if a plane is parallel to two skew lines, then it can intersect the tetrahedron in a quadrilateral? Or maybe a parallelogram? Since it's parallel to two directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rectangle? Let me check.\n\nBut first, I need to find where the plane intersects the edges of the tetrahedron. The tetrahedron has edges AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. The plane is parallel to AB and CD. Therefore, it cannot intersect AB or CD, since it's parallel to them. Therefore, the plane must intersect the other edges: AC, AD, BC, BD. Therefore, four intersection points, forming a quadrilateral. Therefore, the new face is a quadrilateral, and the surface area of each piece will be:\n\nFor one piece: original faces not cut by the plane + the area of the quadrilateral.\n\nBut need to figure out which original faces are included.\n\nAlternatively, since the plane is cutting the tetrahedron into two pieces, each piece will have:\n\n- The quadrilateral face from the cut.\n\n- Some of the original triangular faces.\n\nTherefore, need to figure out which original faces are on each piece.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the surface area by considering both pieces and then figuring out the area of the cut.\n\nBut let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find the intersection points of the plane with edges AC, AD, BC, BD.\n\nLet me parametrize each edge and find the intersection with the plane √2 y + z = √6 / 2.\n\nStarting with edge AC: from A(0,0,0) to C(1, √3, 0). Let me parametrize this edge as A + t(C - A) = (0 + t(1 - 0), 0 + t(√3 - 0), 0 + t(0 - 0)) = (t, t√3, 0), where t ∈ [0, 1].\n\nFind t such that √2*(t√3) + 0 = √6 / 2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n√2 * t√3 = √6 / 2 => t * √6 = √6 / 2 => t = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the intersection point on AC is at t = 1/2: (1/2, (√3)/2, 0). Let me denote this as point E.\n\nNext, edge AD: from A(0,0,0) to D(1, 1/√3, 2√6 / 3). Parametrize as (0 + t(1 - 0), 0 + t(1/√3 - 0), 0 + t(2√6 / 3 - 0)) = (t, t / √3, 2√6 t / 3), t ∈ [0,1].\n\nPlug into plane equation √2 y + z = √6 / 2:\n\n√2*(t / √3) + (2√6 t / 3) = √6 / 2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: √2 * t / √3 = t * √(2/3) = t * √6 / 3.\n\nSecond term: 2√6 t / 3.\n\nTherefore total: t*(√6 / 3 + 2√6 / 3) = t*(3√6 / 3) = t√6.\n\nSet equal to √6 / 2:\n\nt√6 = √6 / 2 => t = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, intersection point on AD is at t=1/2: (1/2, 1/(2√3), (2√6 / 3)*(1/2)) = (1/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3). Let me denote this as point F.\n\nNow edge BC: from B(2,0,0) to C(1, √3, 0). Parametrize as B + t(C - B) = (2 - t, 0 + t(√3 - 0), 0 + t(0 - 0)) = (2 - t, t√3, 0), t ∈ [0,1].\n\nPlug into plane equation √2 y + z = √6 / 2:\n\n√2*(t√3) + 0 = √6 / 2 => same as for edge AC. Therefore, √2 * t√3 = √6 / 2 => t = 1/2. Therefore, intersection point is (2 - 1/2, (1/2)√3, 0) = (3/2, √3 / 2, 0). Let me denote this as point G.\n\nEdge BD: from B(2,0,0) to D(1, 1/√3, 2√6 / 3). Parametrize as B + t(D - B) = (2 - t, 0 + t(1/√3 - 0), 0 + t(2√6 / 3 - 0)) = (2 - t, t / √3, 2√6 t / 3), t ∈ [0,1].\n\nPlug into plane equation √2 y + z = √6 / 2:\n\n√2*(t / √3) + 2√6 t / 3 = same as for edge AD. As before, this simplifies to t√6 = √6 / 2 => t = 1/2. Therefore, intersection point is (2 - 1/2, (1/2)/√3, 2√6 / 3 * 1/2) = (3/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3). Let me denote this as point H.\n\nTherefore, the four intersection points are E(1/2, √3 / 2, 0), F(1/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3), G(3/2, √3 / 2, 0), H(3/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3). \n\nTherefore, the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is the quadrilateral EFGH. Let me check if this is a parallelogram. Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, which are skew lines, but the intersection with the tetrahedron is a quadrilateral. Let me check if EFGH is a parallelogram. For that, vectors EF and GH should be equal, and vectors FG and HE should be equal.\n\nCompute vector EF: F - E = (1/2 - 1/2, 1/(2√3) - √3 / 2, √6 / 3 - 0) = (0, [1/(2√3) - √3 / 2], √6 / 3).\n\nCompute the y-component:\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n1/(2√3) - √3 / 2 = [1 - (√3)(√3)] / (2√3) ? Wait no, let me compute numerically:\n\nLet me rationalize 1/(2√3) = √3 / (6). And √3 / 2 = 3√3 / 6. Therefore, difference is √3 / 6 - 3√3 / 6 = -2√3 / 6 = -√3 / 3. Therefore, vector EF is (0, -√3 / 3, √6 / 3).\n\nSimilarly, vector GH: H - G = (3/2 - 3/2, 1/(2√3) - √3 / 2, √6 / 3 - 0) = same as EF: (0, -√3 / 3, √6 / 3). Therefore, EF = GH. Similarly, vector FG: G - F = (3/2 - 1/2, √3 / 2 - 1/(2√3), 0 - √6 / 3) = (1, [√3 / 2 - 1/(2√3)], -√6 / 3).\n\nCompute the y-component:\n\n√3 / 2 - 1/(2√3) = same as before: 3√3 / 6 - √3 / 6 = 2√3 / 6 = √3 / 3. Therefore, vector FG is (1, √3 / 3, -√6 / 3). Similarly, vector HE: E - H = (1/2 - 3/2, √3 / 2 - 1/(2√3), 0 - √6 / 3) = (-1, √3 / 3 - 1/(2√3), -√6 / 3). Wait, let me compute:\n\nFirst component: -1.\n\nSecond component: √3 / 2 - 1/(2√3) = same as before √3 / 3. Therefore vector HE is (-1, √3 / 3, -√6 / 3). Therefore, vector FG is (1, √3 / 3, -√6 / 3), which is -HE. Therefore, FG = -HE, meaning that HE is the opposite of FG, which is consistent with a parallelogram. Therefore, EFGH is a parallelogram.\n\nTherefore, the area of EFGH can be computed as the magnitude of the cross product of EF and FG. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, vectors EF and FG:\n\nEF = (0, -√3 / 3, √6 / 3)\n\nFG = (1, √3 / 3, -√6 / 3)\n\nCompute cross product EF × FG:\n\n|i           j             k           |\n|0   -√3/3   √6/3|\n|1    √3/3  -√6/3|\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\ni * [ (-√3/3)(-√6/3) - (√6/3)(√3/3) ] - j * [0*(-√6/3) - (√6/3)(1) ] + k * [0*(√3/3) - (-√3/3)(1) ]\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni-component:\n\n[ (√3 * √6) / 9 - (√6 * √3) / 9 ] = [ √18 / 9 - √18 / 9 ] = 0.\n\nj-component:\n\n- [ 0 - √6 / 3 * 1 ] = - [ -√6 / 3 ] = √6 / 3. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe j-component is - [ (EF_x * FG_z - EF_z * FG_x) ] ?\n\nWait, the formula for cross product:\n\ni*(EF_y*FG_z - EF_z*FG_y) - j*(EF_x*FG_z - EF_z*FG_x) + k*(EF_x*FG_y - EF_y*FG_x)\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nWait the cross product formula is:\n\nIf vector EF = (a1, a2, a3), vector FG = (b1, b2, b3), then cross product is:\n\n(a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nWait, but with signs according to the determinant. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation above. Let me recalculate using the standard cross product formula.\n\nEF × FG = (EF_y * FG_z - EF_z * FG_y, EF_z * FG_x - EF_x * FG_z, EF_x * FG_y - EF_y * FG_x)\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst component (i):\n\nEF_y * FG_z - EF_z * FG_y = (-√3 / 3) * (-√6 / 3) - (√6 / 3) * (√3 / 3) = (√18 / 9) - (√18 / 9) = 0.\n\nSecond component (j):\n\nEF_z * FG_x - EF_x * FG_z = (√6 / 3) * 1 - 0 * (-√6 / 3) = √6 / 3 - 0 = √6 / 3. But in cross product, the second component is subtracted in the determinant, so actually the cross product is (i, -j, k)... Wait no, the cross product formula is:\n\nIf you have vectors a × b = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1). Therefore, the components are:\n\nFirst component: a2b3 - a3b2\n\nSecond component: a3b1 - a1b3\n\nThird component: a1b2 - a2b1\n\nTherefore, in our case:\n\nFirst component: 0 as above.\n\nSecond component: EF_z * FG_x - EF_x * FG_z = (√6 / 3)(1) - (0)(-√6 / 3) = √6 / 3 - 0 = √6 / 3.\n\nThird component: EF_x * FG_y - EF_y * FG_x = (0)(√3 / 3) - (-√3 / 3)(1) = 0 + √3 / 3 = √3 / 3.\n\nTherefore, cross product EF × FG = (0, √6 / 3, √3 / 3). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (0)^2 + (√6 / 3)^2 + (√3 / 3)^2 ) = sqrt( 6/9 + 3/9 ) = sqrt(9/9) = sqrt(1) = 1. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram EFGH is |EF × FG| = 1. Therefore, the area of the new face is 1.\n\nTherefore, if I can figure out which original faces are part of one of the pieces, then I can compute the surface area. Let me consider one of the pieces. Let me think about which side of the plane the original vertices lie.\n\nOriginal vertices:\n\nA(0,0,0): plug into plane equation √2 y + z. √2*0 + 0 = 0 < √6 / 2 ≈ 1.2247. Therefore, A is on the side where √2 y + z < √6 / 2.\n\nSimilarly, check for B(2,0,0): √2*0 + 0 = 0 < √6 / 2. So B is also on that side.\n\nCheck C(1, √3, 0): √2*√3 + 0 ≈ 2.449 > √6 / 2 ≈ 1.2247. Therefore, C is on the other side.\n\nCheck D(1, 1/√3, 2√6 / 3): √2*(1/√3) + 2√6 / 3 ≈ √(2/3) + 2√6 / 3 ≈ 0.816 + 1.633 ≈ 2.449 > √6 / 2. Therefore, D is also on the other side.\n\nTherefore, the plane divides the tetrahedron such that vertices A and B are on one side (let's call it the lower piece), and vertices C and D are on the other side (upper piece). Therefore, the lower piece (containing A and B) will have original faces that are entirely on its side. Let's see:\n\nOriginal faces of the tetrahedron are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\n\nFace ABC: contains A, B, C. Since A and B are on the lower side, but C is on the upper side. Therefore, the plane cuts through this face. Similarly, face ABD: contains A, B, D. A and B are on lower, D on upper. Therefore, plane cuts through this face. Face ACD: contains A, C, D. A is lower, C and D upper. Plane cuts through this face. Face BCD: contains B, C, D. B is lower, C and D upper. Plane cuts through this face. Therefore, all original faces are intersected by the plane. Therefore, each piece (lower and upper) will have four faces: the original face cut into two parts, and the new face. Wait, but how does this work? Each original face is cut by the plane, so each piece will have a portion of each original face plus the new face.\n\nBut calculating the surface area would require calculating the area of each original face's portion on the piece plus the area of the new face.\n\nBut maybe there is a smarter way. Since the original tetrahedron's surface area is 4√3, and when we cut it, each piece will have:\n\n- The new face area (1, as computed)\n\n- Plus the sum of the areas of the parts of the original faces that lie on that piece.\n\nHowever, because of the symmetry, maybe each piece's total original surface area contribution is half of the original? But no, since the original faces are cut, and depending on the piece, different portions.\n\nAlternatively, note that when you cut the tetrahedron with the plane, each original face is divided into a smaller polygon (probably a triangle and a quadrilateral or something else). But since all original faces are being cut, maybe we can compute the surface area of the lower piece as follows:\n\nThe lower piece includes:\n\n- The original face AB (but AB is an edge, not a face). Wait, original faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD. The lower piece contains parts of these four faces.\n\nAlternatively, think of the lower piece as a polyhedron with vertices A, B, E, F, G, H? Wait, no. The intersection points are E, F, G, H. The lower piece would have vertices A, B, E, G, F, H? Let me think.\n\nActually, the lower piece is bounded by:\n\n- The original edges AB (since the plane is parallel to AB and doesn't intersect it).\n\n- The intersection points E (on AC), F (on AD), G (on BC), H (on BD).\n\nTherefore, the lower piece has the following faces:\n\n- The original face AB (edge, but not a face).\n\nWait, perhaps the lower piece has:\n\n- The quadrilateral EFGH (the new face).\n\n- The quadrilateral A, E, G, B. Because from A to E to G to B.\n\n- The quadrilateral A, F, H, B. From A to F to H to B.\n\n- And also the triangle A, E, F? Or maybe not. Wait, need to think carefully.\n\nActually, the lower piece is a kind of prismatoid. Let me try to figure out all its faces.\n\nThe intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is quadrilateral EFGH. The lower piece includes all points of the tetrahedron on the same side of the plane as A and B. Therefore, the lower piece's faces are:\n\n1. The quadrilateral EFGH (new face).\n\n2. The face between A, B, G, E. Wait, since AB is an edge, and the plane cuts AC at E and BC at G. Therefore, connecting A to E to G to B forms a quadrilateral? Or maybe a triangle?\n\nWait, if you look at face ABC of the original tetrahedron, which is a triangle. The plane cuts AC at E and BC at G. Therefore, the portion of face ABC on the lower piece is triangle A, E, G. Similarly, the portion on the upper piece is quadrilateral E, G, C, something? Wait, but the upper piece has vertices C and D, so maybe quadrilateral E, G, C, ... Hmm.\n\nSimilarly, for face ABD, which is triangle ABD. The plane cuts AD at F and BD at H. Therefore, the portion on the lower piece is triangle A, F, H. \n\nFor face ACD: original face ACD is triangle. The plane cuts AC at E and AD at F. Therefore, the portion on the lower piece is triangle A, E, F.\n\nFor face BCD: original face BCD is triangle. The plane cuts BC at G and BD at H. Therefore, the portion on the lower piece is triangle B, G, H.\n\nTherefore, the lower piece has the following faces:\n\n- The new face EFGH.\n\n- The four triangles: AEG, AFH, AEF, BGH.\n\nWait, but AEG, AFH, AEF, BGH? Wait:\n\n- From face ABC: triangle AEG.\n\n- From face ABD: triangle AFH.\n\n- From face ACD: triangle AEF.\n\n- From face BCD: triangle BGH.\n\nPlus the new face EFGH. Therefore, total surface area of lower piece is area(EFGH) + area(AEG) + area(AFH) + area(AEF) + area(BGH). \n\nBut wait, also need to check if there are other faces. For example, the edges AE, AF, BG, BH are part of the lower piece. However, since the lower piece is a polyhedron, we need to ensure all its faces are accounted for. However, since the original tetrahedron had four triangular faces, each contributing a triangle to the lower piece, and the new face EFGH. Therefore, total of five faces? But a polyhedron must satisfy Euler's formula. Let me check:\n\nVertices of lower piece: A, B, E, F, G, H. 6 vertices.\n\nEdges: Let's count.\n\nOriginal edges AB, AE, AF, BG, BH, EG, FH, EF, FG, GH, HE. Wait, need to be careful. The lower piece has:\n\n- Original edges AB.\n\n- Edges from A to E, A to F.\n\n- Edges from B to G, B to H.\n\n- Edges from E to G (part of original face ABC cut), from E to F (part of original face ACD cut), from F to H (part of original face ABD cut), from G to H (part of original face BCD cut).\n\n- And the new face edges EFGH: E to F, F to G? Wait, no, EFGH is a quadrilateral. From E to F to G to H to E? Wait, earlier we had E(1/2, √3 / 2, 0), F(1/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3), G(3/2, √3 / 2, 0), H(3/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3). Connecting E to F to H to G to E? Wait, no. Wait, the quadrilateral EFGH is E connected to F connected to G connected to H connected to E? Wait, earlier we saw that EFGH is a parallelogram with EF and GH as opposite sides, FG and HE as opposite sides. Therefore, the quadrilateral is E-F-G-H-E.\n\nTherefore, edges of the lower piece:\n\nOriginal edges: AB.\n\nEdges from A: AE, AF.\n\nEdges from B: BG, BH.\n\nEdges from E: EG, EF, EH? Wait, E is connected to G (from triangle AEG), E is connected to F (from triangle AEF and the new face EFGH), and E is connected to H? No, E is connected to G and F. Similarly, F is connected to A, H, and E. G is connected to B, E, and H? Wait, G is connected to B (from triangle B-G-H?), and to E (from triangle A-E-G), and to H? From the new face EFGH, G is connected to H. Similarly, H is connected to B, F, and G. \n\nTherefore, the faces of the lower piece are:\n\n- AB (edge, but not a face). Wait, no, faces are:\n\n1. Triangle AEG (from face ABC).\n\n2. Triangle AFH (from face ABD).\n\n3. Triangle AEF (from face ACD).\n\n4. Triangle BGH (from face BCD).\n\n5. Quadrilateral EFGH (new face).\n\nAdditionally, is there another face? For example, between A, B, G, E? Wait, if you connect A to B to G to E to A, that would be a quadrilateral. However, in reality, the original face ABC is cut into triangle AEG and quadrilateral EGC... but since we are only considering the lower piece, which includes AEG. However, the edge AB is part of the original tetrahedron. But in the lower piece, AB is still present. However, the face AB is not a face of the lower piece, because the lower piece has other faces adjacent to AB. Wait, actually, in the original tetrahedron, AB is part of two faces: ABC and ABD. In the lower piece, AB is part of the triangles AEG and AFH? No, AB is an edge, not a face. The faces adjacent to AB in the lower piece are:\n\n- The triangle AEG (which includes A and E and G, but not B).\n\n- The triangle AFH (which includes A and F and H, but not B).\n\n- The quadrilateral EFGH?\n\nNo, the edge AB is only connected to the original face, but since the lower piece includes AB as an edge, but the adjacent faces to AB in the lower piece would be the triangles AEG and AFH? No, those don't include AB. Wait, maybe there is another face? This suggests that my earlier analysis is missing some faces.\n\nWait, perhaps the lower piece also includes the original face AB? But AB is an edge, not a face. Wait, no, the original tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a triangle. When we cut the tetrahedron, the lower piece retains parts of each original face. For example, the original face ABC is cut into triangle AEG (on the lower piece) and quadrilateral EGC... (on the upper piece). Similarly, original face ABD is cut into triangle AFH (on lower) and quadrilateral FHDB... (on upper). Original face ACD is cut into triangle AEF (lower) and quadrilateral EFCD (upper). Original face BCD is cut into triangle BGH (lower) and quadrilateral GHDC (upper). Therefore, the lower piece has four triangular faces (AEG, AFH, AEF, BGH) and the new quadrilateral face EFGH. However, in addition, the lower piece must have another face connecting AB with something? Because AB is an edge, but in the lower piece, AB is connected to the rest of the polyhedron. However, since AB is not intersected by the plane, and the plane is parallel to AB, maybe there is another face?\n\nWait, no. Because the lower piece is bounded by the original faces (as cut) and the new face. Since AB is part of the original tetrahedron, but in the lower piece, AB is connected to the triangles AEG and AFH? No, AB is not part of those triangles. Wait, this suggests that my previous analysis is incomplete. There must be another face on the lower piece that includes AB. But where?\n\nWait, perhaps the lower piece has another quadrilateral face connecting AB with E and G or something? Let me think. Since AB is an edge, and the plane cuts AC at E and BC at G, then the portion of face ABC on the lower piece is triangle AEG. Similarly, the portion of face ABD on the lower piece is triangle AFH. However, the edge AB is still present. How is AB connected to the rest of the lower piece? It must be connected via another face. Wait, perhaps there is a quadrilateral face ABGE? But ABGE would be a four-sided figure: A to B to G to E to A. Is this a face?\n\nBut in reality, the original face ABC was cut into triangle AEG and quadrilateral EGC... So if you look at the lower piece, it has triangle AEG. But the edge AG is part of the lower piece? AG is from A to G? Wait, no. G is on BC. AG is not an original edge. Wait, in the lower piece, there is a triangle AEG. So A connected to E connected to G connected back to A. Therefore, the face AEG is a triangle. Similarly, there is a triangle BGH. But AB is an edge not connected to these triangles. Therefore, there must be another face connecting AB with something. Wait, maybe the lower piece has another face that is a quadrilateral ABHG? No, H is on BD. Similarly, maybe AB is connected to the new face? The new face is EFGH. AB is not connected to EFGH. Therefore, there must be another face. \n\nWait, maybe I missed that the lower piece also includes the original face AB? But AB is just an edge. Wait, no, the original tetrahedron's faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD. When you cut the tetrahedron, the lower piece does not include any of the original faces entirely, since all original faces are cut. Therefore, the lower piece's faces are only the portions of the original faces (the four triangles) and the new face. Therefore, how is AB connected? It must be connected via the triangles AEG and AFH? But AB is not part of those triangles. This suggests an inconsistency. Therefore, my analysis is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps there are two more triangular faces connecting AB to E and G? For example, triangle ABE and ABG? But those would be new faces. However, the plane cuts the tetrahedron, so the only new face is EFGH. Therefore, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the lower piece is not convex? No, the plane cut should produce convex pieces. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the lower piece only has those five faces. Let me think again. The intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is EFGH. The lower piece is the part containing A and B. Therefore, the boundary of the lower piece consists of:\n\n- The quadrilateral EFGH.\n\n- The parts of the original faces that are on the lower side.\n\nEach original face contributes a triangle to the lower piece:\n\n- Face ABC contributes triangle AEG.\n\n- Face ABD contributes triangle AFH.\n\n- Face ACD contributes triangle AEF.\n\n- Face BCD contributes triangle BGH.\n\nBut then, how are these triangles connected? For example, triangle AEG is connected to triangle AEF via edge AE, and to triangle BGH via edge EG? Wait, no. Triangle AEG has vertices A, E, G. Triangle AEF has vertices A, E, F. These share edge AE. Triangle EFGH has vertices E, F, G, H. So edge EF is shared between AEF and EFGH. Similarly, edge EG is shared between AEG and EFGH. Similarly, triangle AFH shares edge AF with AEF and edge FH with EFGH. Triangle BGH shares edge GH with EFGH and edge BG with... where? BG is part of triangle BGH and connected to... where? To the original face BCD? But triangle BGH is part of the lower piece. How is BG connected? It connects to B and G. B is connected to A and H (triangle AFH). G is connected to E and H? No, G is connected to E and H? No, G is connected to E (from AEG) and to H via the new face EFGH? No, in EFGH, G is connected to F and H? Wait, EFGH is E-F-G-H-E? Wait, earlier we saw that EFGH is a parallelogram with edges EF, FG, GH, HE. Therefore, G is connected to F and H. Therefore, triangle BGH shares edge GH with EFGH and edge BG with... where? BG is connected to B and G. B is connected to A and H (from triangle AFH). Therefore, triangle BGH is connected to triangle AFH via point H? No, triangle BGH has vertices B, G, H. Triangle AFH has vertices A, F, H. They share point H, but not an edge. Therefore, there must be another face connecting BGH to the rest. \n\nThis suggests that my previous analysis is missing some faces. Perhaps there are additional triangular faces? For example, connecting B to G to H and also B to H to A? But B to H to A is part of triangle AFH. Wait, triangle AFH is A-F-H. If we consider the edge BH, which is part of triangle BGH, how is BH connected? It connects to B and H. H is connected to F and G. Therefore, there must be another face connecting BH with something. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to use Euler's formula to check the number of faces, edges, vertices.\n\nVertices: A, B, E, F, G, H. 6 vertices.\n\nEdges:\n\nOriginal edges cut by plane: AE, AF, BG, BH, EG, FH, EF, FG, GH, HE. Wait:\n\nFrom the lower piece:\n\n- Original edges: AB.\n\n- Edges from cuts: AE, AF, BG, BH, EG, FH.\n\n- Edges from new face EFGH: EF, FG, GH, HE.\n\nWait, total edges:\n\nAB, AE, AF, BG, BH, EG, FH, EF, FG, GH, HE. That's 11 edges.\n\nFaces:\n\nLet me count:\n\n- Quadrilateral EFGH.\n\n- Triangles: AEG, AFH, AEF, BGH.\n\nPlus what else? If there are 6 vertices and 11 edges, let's use Euler's formula V - E + F = 2? For a convex polyhedron.\n\nV - E + F = 6 - 11 + F = 2 => F = 7. Currently, we have 1 quadrilateral + 4 triangles = 5 faces. Therefore, need two more faces. What are they?\n\nPossibly two more triangular faces: ABG and ABH? But ABG would be triangle A, B, G. Is this a face? Let me check if points A, B, G are coplanar with any existing face. Original face ABC contains A, B, C, and G is on BC. Therefore, triangle ABG is part of the original face ABC, which was cut into triangle AEG. However, triangle ABG is larger than AEG. But since the lower piece contains AEG, not ABG. Therefore, ABG is not a face of the lower piece. \n\nWait, but maybe there are two more triangular faces connecting AB with something? For example, AB connected to E and G? If you consider the polygon ABGE, which is a quadrilateral, but maybe it's divided into two triangles ABG and AEG? But AEG is already a face. If ABG is another face, then yes. But ABG would be a triangle on the lower piece? However, the plane cuts the original face ABC into AEG and EGC... So if ABG is part of the lower piece, then it would overlap with AEG? No, because G is on BC. So triangle ABG would include the triangle AEG? Not necessarily. Let me check coordinates.\n\nPoint A is (0,0,0), B is (2,0,0), G is (3/2, √3 / 2, 0). These three points are coplanar (they lie on the original face ABC, which is on the z=0 plane). The triangle ABG is indeed part of the original face ABC, and since G is between B and C, triangle ABG is on the lower piece? But earlier I thought the lower piece only has triangle AEG from face ABC. However, if ABG is also part of the lower piece, then there is inconsistency. \n\nWait, actually, when we cut the original face ABC with the plane, which intersects AC at E and BC at G, the portion of ABC on the lower piece is the quadrilateral ABGE? Because from A to B to G to E to A? But since the plane cuts ABC, the intersection is line segment EG. Therefore, the lower piece contains the part of ABC that is below the plane, which is the quadrilateral ABGE? But earlier I thought it was triangle AEG. Which is it?\n\nWait, let me think. The plane intersects ABC along EG. The side of the plane containing A and B is the lower piece. Therefore, the portion of ABC on the lower piece is the region of ABC that is on the same side of EG as A and B. Since EG is a line segment from E on AC to G on BC. In triangle ABC, the line EG divides it into two parts: triangle AEG and quadrilateral EGC... Wait, no, EG divides ABC into triangle AEG and quadrilateral EGC...? No, if you draw a line from E on AC to G on BC, it divides ABC into triangle AEG and quadrilateral EGB... Wait, no, triangle EGB? No. Actually, it divides ABC into triangle AEG and a quadrilateral EGB...? No, if you have triangle ABC and draw a line from E (on AC) to G (on BC), then it divides ABC into triangle AEG and a quadrilateral EGB... Wait, but EGB is not a quadrilateral. Wait, from E to G to B to A? No, it divides ABC into triangle AEG and triangle EGB? Wait, no. Because E is on AC and G is on BC. Connecting E to G would create triangle AEG and a four-sided figure E, G, B, C? But since we are only considering the part on the lower side of the plane. Wait, the plane cuts through EG. The lower piece contains A and B, so in triangle ABC, the lower piece would contain the area below EG, which is the quadrilateral ABGE? Because from A to B to G to E to A. However, since A, B, G, E are coplanar (on ABC's plane), this is a quadrilateral. But earlier I thought it was triangle AEG. This suggests my earlier analysis was incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the portion of face ABC on the lower piece is the quadrilateral ABGE, not triangle AEG. Similarly, for face ABD, the portion on the lower piece is quadrilateral ABHF, where H is on BD and F is on AD. Similarly, for face ACD and BCD, what happens?\n\nWait, this changes things. Let me re-examine.\n\nOriginal face ABC is cut by the plane along segment EG. The lower piece contains A and B, so the portion of ABC on the lower piece is quadrilateral ABGE. Similarly, original face ABD is cut by the plane along segment FH (connecting F on AD and H on BD). The lower piece contains A and B, so the portion of ABD on the lower piece is quadrilateral ABHF. \n\nOriginal face ACD is cut by the plane along segment EF (connecting E on AC and F on AD). The lower piece contains A, but not C or D. Therefore, the portion of ACD on the lower piece is triangle AEF. Similarly, original face BCD is cut by the plane along segment GH (connecting G on BC and H on BD). The lower piece contains B, but not C or D, so the portion of BCD on the lower piece is triangle BGH.\n\nTherefore, the lower piece has the following faces:\n\n1. Quadrilateral ABGE (from face ABC).\n\n2. Quadrilateral ABHF (from face ABD).\n\n3. Triangle AEF (from face ACD).\n\n4. Triangle BGH (from face BCD).\n\n5. Quadrilateral EFGH (new face).\n\nTherefore, total of five faces. Let's check Euler's formula again:\n\nVertices: 6.\n\nEdges: AB, AE, AF, AG, AH, BG, BH, EG, FH, EF, FG, GH, HE. Wait, need to list all edges properly.\n\nActually, edges are:\n\n- From quadrilateral ABGE: AB, BG, GE, EA.\n\n- From quadrilateral ABHF: AB, BH, HF, FA.\n\n- From triangle AEF: AE, EF, FA.\n\n- From triangle BGH: BG, GH, HB.\n\n- From quadrilateral EFGH: EF, FG, GH, HE.\n\nTherefore, listing all edges:\n\nAB, AE, AF, BG, BH, GE, EA (same as AE), FA (same as AF), BH (already listed), HF, GH, HB (same as BH), EF, FG, HE.\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Let me count carefully:\n\n- AB is one edge.\n\n- From ABGE: AB, BG, GE, EA.\n\n- From ABHF: AB, BH, HF, FA.\n\n- From AEF: AE, EF, FA.\n\n- From BGH: BG, GH, HB.\n\n- From EFGH: EF, FG, GH, HE.\n\nNow, unique edges:\n\nAB, AE, AF, BG, BH, GE, HF, EF, FG, GH, HE.\n\nTotal of 11 edges. Which matches our previous count. \n\nFaces: 5 faces as listed. Using Euler's formula:\n\nV - E + F = 6 - 11 + 5 = 0. Wait, for a polyhedron, it should be 2. What's wrong here? Maybe my face count is wrong. Let me recount faces:\n\n1. ABGE: quadrilateral.\n\n2. ABHF: quadrilateral.\n\n3. AEF: triangle.\n\n4. BGH: triangle.\n\n5. EFGH: quadrilateral.\n\nTotal 5 faces. V - E + F = 6 - 11 + 5 = 0. Hmm, which suggests it's not a closed polyhedron or my count is wrong. Maybe there are more faces? For example, the edge GE is part of ABGE and EFGH. Similarly, HF is part of ABHF and EFGH? No, HF is part of ABHF and maybe another face? \n\nWait, maybe there are two more triangular faces: AEF and BGH, but they are already counted. Or perhaps I missed some faces? For example, is there a face connecting E to H? Yes, HE is part of EFGH. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the lower piece is not a simple polyhedron? Or maybe my identification of faces is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula applies to connected planar graphs, and for non-convex or other polyhedrons, it might differ? Or maybe I made a mistake in the count. Let me try again.\n\nVertices: 6 (A, B, E, F, G, H).\n\nEdges: Let's list them:\n\n- AB.\n\n- AE, AF.\n\n- BG, BH.\n\n- GE, HF.\n\n- EF, FG, GH, HE.\n\nWait, GE is from G to E, HF is from H to F? No, HF is from H to F? In the face ABHF, we have HF as from H to F. Yes. So edges are:\n\nAB, AE, AF, BG, BH, GE, HF, EF, FG, GH, HE. Total 11 edges.\n\nFaces:\n\n1. ABGE: bounded by AB, BG, GE, EA.\n\n2. ABHF: bounded by AB, BH, HF, FA.\n\n3. AEF: bounded by AE, EF, FA.\n\n4. BGH: bounded by BG, GH, HB.\n\n5. EFGH: bounded by EF, FG, GH, HE.\n\nYes, five faces. Then V - E + F = 6 - 11 + 5 = 0. Hmm, which suggests it's not a polyhedron (which should have V - E + F = 2). This suggests there is a topological error, likely due to my incorrect identification of faces. Perhaps some faces are not properly closed or there are overlapping faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lower piece is not a simple polyhedron but has a \"hole\"? No, it should be a solid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are two more faces that I missed. For example, the face EHA or something? Let me think. If we consider the face connecting E, H, and A? But that would be triangle EHA, which is part of the original face ACD? Wait, original face ACD is cut into triangle AEF and the rest. Point H is not on ACD. Therefore, no. Alternatively, maybe there is a face connecting E, H, G? No, that's part of EFGH. \n\nWait, perhaps the face ABGE is not a single face but divided? No, ABGE is a quadrilateral on the original face ABC. Similarly for ABHF. \n\nThis suggests that my analysis is incorrect, and I need to rethink.\n\nMaybe it's better to calculate the surface area by considering that each original face is split into two parts, and the surface area of the lower piece is half the original surface area plus the area of the new face? But earlier I thought all original faces are cut, so it's not half. However, given the symmetry, since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, perhaps each original face is cut in such a way that the area on each piece is half of the original face's area? If that were true, then the surface area of the lower piece would be 2√3 (half of 4√3) + 1 (the new face). But let's check.\n\nOriginal surface area is 4√3. If each original face is split evenly, then each piece would have 2√3 from original faces plus the new face area 1, giving total surface area 2√3 + 1. But I need to verify if the original faces are indeed split evenly.\n\nTake face ABC: area is √3. If the lower piece has a portion of it, what is its area? Previously, I thought it was a triangle AEG or a quadrilateral ABGE. Let's calculate both.\n\nFirst, if it's triangle AEG: points A(0,0,0), E(1/2, √3 / 2, 0), G(3/2, √3 / 2, 0). This is a triangle in the z=0 plane. Let me calculate its area.\n\nVectors AE = E - A = (1/2, √3 / 2, 0)\n\nAG = G - A = (3/2, √3 / 2, 0)\n\nArea is 1/2 |AE × AG|.\n\nCompute cross product:\n\nAE × AG = |i   j   k|\n            1/2 √3/2 0\n            3/2 √3/2 0\n\n= i*( (√3/2 * 0 - 0 * √3/2 ) - j*(1/2 * 0 - 0 * 3/2 ) + k*(1/2 * √3/2 - √3/2 * 3/2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\ni*(0) - j*(0) + k*( (√3 / 4) - (3√3 / 4 )) = k*( -2√3 / 4 ) = -√3 / 2 k.\n\nMagnitude is √3 / 2. Therefore, area is 1/2 * √3 / 2 = √3 / 4.\n\nIf instead, the face ABGE is a quadrilateral, its area can be calculated as the area of ABC minus the area of EGC... But since we are on the lower piece, let's calculate it directly.\n\nPoints A(0,0,0), B(2,0,0), G(3/2, √3 / 2, 0), E(1/2, √3 / 2, 0). This is a quadrilateral in the z=0 plane. It can be divided into two triangles: ABG and AEG, or ABGE can be calculated as a trapezoid?\n\nAlternatively, since it's a quadrilateral, we can use the shoelace formula.\n\nOrder of points: A(0,0), B(2,0), G(3/2, √3 / 2), E(1/2, √3 / 2), back to A(0,0).\n\nShoelace formula:\n\nArea = 1/2 |sum_{i} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst, list the coordinates in order:\n\nA: (0, 0)\n\nB: (2, 0)\n\nG: (3/2, √3 / 2)\n\nE: (1/2, √3 / 2)\n\nBack to A: (0, 0)\n\nCompute terms:\n\nx_A * y_B - x_B * y_A = 0*0 - 2*0 = 0\n\nx_B * y_G - x_G * y_B = 2*(√3 / 2) - (3/2)*0 = √3\n\nx_G * y_E - x_E * y_G = (3/2)*(√3 / 2) - (1/2)*(√3 / 2) = (3√3 / 4 - √3 / 4) = 2√3 / 4 = √3 / 2\n\nx_E * y_A - x_A * y_E = (1/2)*0 - 0*(√3 / 2) = 0\n\nSum: 0 + √3 + √3 / 2 + 0 = (3√3)/2\n\nArea = 1/2 * |3√3 / 2| = 3√3 / 4.\n\nOriginal area of face ABC is √3, so the area of ABGE is 3√3 / 4, and the area of the remaining part (quadrilateral EGC... ) is √3 - 3√3 / 4 = √3 / 4. This matches the area of triangle AEG calculated earlier. Therefore, the lower piece has 3√3 / 4 from face ABC, not √3 / 4. This suggests that my initial assumption of the face being triangle AEG was incorrect, and it is indeed the quadrilateral ABGE with area 3√3 / 4.\n\nTherefore, returning to the surface area calculation, if the lower piece has portions of all four original faces, each contributing 3√3 / 4, 3√3 / 4, and so on? Wait, no, each original face is treated differently.\n\nWait, for face ABC, lower piece has 3√3 / 4.\n\nFor face ABD: similar calculation. Let's compute the area of ABHF.\n\nPoints A(0,0,0), B(2,0,0), H(3/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3), F(1/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3). This quadrilateral is in the plane of face ABD. Let me calculate its area.\n\nFirst, let me note that face ABD is a triangle with area √3. The plane cuts this face into ABHF (lower piece) and the remaining part. To calculate the area of ABHF, we can use shoelace formula, but need coordinates in 2D. However, since it's in 3D, it might be complex. Alternatively, note that by symmetry, the area of ABHF should be equal to the area of ABGE, which is 3√3 / 4. Since the cut is symmetric with respect to faces ABC and ABD? Given that the plane is halfway between AB and CD, and the tetrahedron is regular, it's plausible that the area of ABHF is also 3√3 / 4.\n\nFor face ACD: the lower piece has triangle AEF. Earlier calculation gave area √3 / 4.\n\nSimilarly, for face BCD: lower piece has triangle BGH, also area √3 / 4.\n\nTherefore, total original surface area contribution to the lower piece is:\n\nABGE: 3√3 / 4\n\nABHF: 3√3 / 4\n\nAEF: √3 / 4\n\nBGH: √3 / 4\n\nTotal: 3√3 / 4 + 3√3 / 4 + √3 / 4 + √3 / 4 = (3 + 3 + 1 + 1)√3 / 4 = 8√3 / 4 = 2√3.\n\nPlus the area of the new face EFGH, which is 1. Therefore, total surface area of the lower piece is 2√3 + 1. \n\nSimilarly, the upper piece would have the remaining original surface area: 4√3 - 2√3 = 2√3, plus the same new face area 1, giving also 2√3 + 1. But this seems contradictory, because cutting a tetrahedron should not produce two pieces with the same surface area if their shapes are different. But given the symmetry, maybe it's correct? Wait, the original surface area is 4√3. Each piece has 2√3 from original faces + 1 from the new face, totaling 2√3 + 1. But let's verify with numbers.\n\nIf original surface area is 4√3, and each piece has 2√3 + 1, then combined surface area would be 2*(2√3 + 1) = 4√3 + 2, which is greater than the original surface area. This is because each piece includes the new face, so when combined, the total surface area is original surface area + 2 * new face area. Which makes sense, since the cut introduces two new faces (one for each piece). Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the surface area of one of the pieces is 2√3 + 1. However, let me verify the calculation for face AEF and BGH.\n\nFor face AEF: points A(0,0,0), E(1/2, √3 / 2, 0), F(1/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3). Let me calculate its area.\n\nVectors AE = (1/2, √3 / 2, 0), AF = (1/2, 1/(2√3), √6 / 3).\n\nCross product AE × AF = |i   j   k|\n                         1/2 √3/2 0\n                         1/2 1/(2√3) √6/3\n\n= i*( (√3/2 * √6/3 - 0 * 1/(2√3)) ) - j*( (1/2 * √6/3 - 0 * 1/2) ) + k*(1/2 * 1/(2√3) - √3/2 * 1/2 )\n\nCalculate each component:\n\ni: (√3 * √6) / (2 * 3) - 0 = √18 / 6 = (3√2) / 6 = √2 / 2.\n\nj: - [ (√6 / 6 - 0) ] = -√6 / 6.\n\nk: [1/(4√3) - √3 / 4] = [1/(4√3) - 3/(4√3)] = (-2)/(4√3) = -1/(2√3).\n\nTherefore, cross product vector is (√2 / 2, -√6 / 6, -1/(2√3)).\n\nMagnitude squared: ( (√2 / 2)^2 + (-√6 / 6)^2 + (-1/(2√3))^2 )\n\n= (2/4) + (6/36) + (1/(4*3)) \n\n= 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/12 \n\n= 6/12 + 2/12 + 1/12 = 9/12 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, magnitude is √(3/4) = √3 / 2.\n\nTherefore, area is 1/2 * √3 / 2 = √3 / 4. Which matches our previous result. So area of AEF is √3 / 4. Similarly for BGH.\n\nTherefore, total original surface area contribution is indeed 2√3, and adding the new face area 1, total surface area of the piece is 2√3 + 1.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"surface area of one of these pieces.\" Given that, the answer should be 2√3 + 1. But let me check units and calculations again.\n\nWait, the new face area was calculated as 1. Let me confirm: we had the parallelogram EFGH with area 1. Yes, since the cross product magnitude was 1. Therefore, area is 1.\n\nOriginal surface area contribution is 2√3. Therefore, total surface area is 2√3 + 1. But let me check if the problem expects a simplified form or rationalized form. The answer is likely to be written as 1 + 2√3, but let me check if there is a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the assumption that the lower piece has 2√3 from original faces. Let me verify:\n\nFor face ABC: 3√3 / 4.\n\nFor face ABD: 3√3 / 4.\n\nFor face ACD: √3 / 4.\n\nFor face BCD: √3 / 4.\n\nTotal: 3√3 / 4 + 3√3 / 4 + √3 / 4 + √3 / 4 = 8√3 / 4 = 2√3. Correct.\n\nYes, so the total original surface area for the lower piece is 2√3, plus the new face 1, giving 2√3 + 1.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. The original surface area is 4√3. When we cut the tetrahedron, we add two new faces (one for each piece), each of area 1. So total surface area of both pieces combined is 4√3 + 2*1 = 4√3 + 2. Therefore, each piece has surface area (4√3 + 2)/2 = 2√3 + 1. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, this confirms that the surface area of one piece is 2√3 + 1.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"surface area of one of these pieces.\" So the answer should be 1 + 2√3. But let me check if the question wants it in a specific form or if there is a calculation mistake.\n\nBut let me verify with actual numbers. For example, if I calculate the numerical value:\n\n2√3 ≈ 2 * 1.732 ≈ 3.464\n\nAdding 1: ≈ 4.464.\n\nOriginal surface area is 4√3 ≈ 6.928. Divided into two pieces, each with ≈ 4.464, which is plausible since each piece gains an additional 1.\n\nBut let me think if there is another way this could be calculated, perhaps leading to a different answer. For example, if the new face area was miscalculated.\n\nEarlier, we found that the area of EFGH is 1, by calculating the cross product of EF and FG, which gave magnitude 1. Let me verify this again.\n\nVectors EF = (0, -√3 / 3, √6 / 3), FG = (1, √3 / 3, -√6 / 3). Cross product was (0, √6 / 3, √3 / 3), magnitude 1. Correct.\n\nYes, so area is 1. Therefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the surface area of one of the pieces is 1 + 2√3. Therefore, the answer is 1 + 2√3, which can be written as 2√3 + 1. \n\nBut let me check for any possible miscalculations in the original face areas. For example, for face ABGE, we calculated 3√3 / 4. Let me verify this with another method. Since the plane cuts the edge AC at midpoint (t=1/2) and BC at midpoint (t=1/2), so E and G are midpoints of AC and BC, respectively. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, earlier when we found the intersection points on AC and BC, we had t=1/2. For edge AC, from A(0,0,0) to C(1, √3, 0), midpoint is at t=1/2: (0.5, √3/2, 0), which is point E. Similarly, for edge BC, from B(2,0,0) to C(1, √3, 0), midpoint is at t=1/2: (1.5, √3/2, 0), which is point G. Therefore, E and G are midpoints of AC and BC. Therefore, segment EG is the midline of triangle ABC, parallel to AB and half its length. Wait, AB has length 2, so EG should have length 1. Let me check the distance between E(0.5, √3/2, 0) and G(1.5, √3/2, 0): distance is sqrt((1.5 - 0.5)^2 + 0 + 0) = sqrt(1^2) = 1. Correct. Therefore, quadrilateral ABGE is a trapezoid with bases AB (length 2) and EG (length 1), and height... what is the height?\n\nIn triangle ABC, which is equilateral with side length 2, the height is √3. The midline EG is at half the height, so the height of the trapezoid ABGE would be half of the height of the triangle, which is √3 / 2. Therefore, area of trapezoid ABGE is (AB + EG) / 2 * height = (2 + 1)/2 * √3 / 2 = (3/2) * (√3 / 2) = 3√3 / 4, which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for face ABHF, same logic applies since it's symmetric, giving area 3√3 / 4. For triangles AEF and BGH, since F and H are midpoints of AD and BD, respectively, and E and G are midpoints of AC and BC, then AEF is a smaller triangle. In an equilateral triangle, connecting midpoints divides it into four smaller triangles of equal area. But here, AEF is part of face ACD, which is an equilateral triangle. Let me think.\n\nFace ACD is triangle with vertices A, C, D. Points E is midpoint of AC, F is midpoint of AD. Connecting E and F gives a midline, parallel to CD and half its length. Therefore, triangle AEF is similar to triangle ACD with ratio 1/2, so area is (1/2)^2 * area of ACD = 1/4 * √3, which is √3 / 4. Correct. Similarly for BGH.\n\nTherefore, all calculations are consistent. Therefore, the surface area of one piece is 2√3 + 1.\n\nBut let me check units. The original tetrahedron has edge length 2, and all calculations are consistent with that. Therefore, the answer should be 1 + 2√3. However, let me check if the problem specifies which piece, but since it says \"the plane... lying halfway between them cuts ABCD into two pieces. Find the surface area of one of these pieces.\" Given the symmetry, both pieces have the same surface area, so the answer is 1 + 2√3.\n\nBut let me check if there is an alternative way to get this result, perhaps more elegantly, to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, and given the symmetry, the intersection is a parallelogram with area 1, as computed. The surface area of each piece is half the original surface area plus the area of the new face. Wait, but original surface area is 4√3, half is 2√3, plus 1, gives 2√3 + 1. Which is what we found. This seems to be a general result when cutting a convex polyhedron with a plane, the surface area of each piece is half the original surface area plus the area of the new face, assuming the cut is symmetric and divides each original face evenly. But in reality, it's not exactly half the original surface area, but in this case, due to the specific symmetry, it turns out that way.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the surface area of one of the pieces is 1 + 2√3. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1 + 2\\sqrt{3}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1 + 2\\sqrt{3}}\n</think>"}
