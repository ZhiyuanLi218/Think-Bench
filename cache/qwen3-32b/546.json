Understanding the Setup**\n\n- A **truck** is moving **towards the observer at 1 m/s**.\n- There are **two loudspeakers** on the truck:\n  - One **facing forward** (towards the observer).\n  - One **facing backward** (towards the building behind the truck).\n- Each loudspeaker **emits a sound at 1000 Hz** in its own frame of reference.\n- The **observer is stationary**, and the **building is also stationary**.\n- The **rear loudspeaker's sound** is reflected from the **building** and reaches the **observer**.\n- The **front loudspeaker's sound** reaches the observer **directly**.\n- The **frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers**, as observed (i.e., taking into account the Doppler effect), are given as:\n  - **Front loudspeaker**: 1003 Hz\n  - **Rear loudspeaker**: 997 Hz\n\n---\n\n### **2. Doppler Effect Analysis**\n\nThe Doppler effect causes a shift in frequency when a source of sound moves relative to a stationary observer (or vice versa). The relevant formula when the **source is moving** and the **observer is stationary** is:\n\n$$\nf' = f \\cdot \\frac{v}{v \\pm v_s}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ f' $ is the observed frequency,\n- $ f $ is the emitted frequency,\n- $ v $ is the speed of sound (assume $ v = 343 \\, \\mathrm{m/s} $),\n- $ v_s $ is the speed of the source,\n- Use $ - $ when the source moves **towards** the observer,\n- Use $ + $ when the source moves **away from** the observer.\n\n#### **Front Loudspeaker (Moving Toward Observer):**\n\n$$\nf_{\\text{front}}' = 1000 \\cdot \\frac{343}{343 - 1} \\approx 1003 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\n#### **Rear Loudspeaker (Moving Away from Building):**\n\n$$\nf_{\\text{rear}}' = 1000 \\cdot \\frac{343}{343 + 1} \\approx 997 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\nThis matches the given values, confirming that the **Doppler shift has already been applied** to the emitted frequencies.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

The truck is moving towards me at 1 m/s. Both loudspeakers are supposed to vibrate at 1000 Hz, but somehow the front one is producing 1003 Hz and the back one is producing 997 Hz. The question is asking for the beat frequency heard by an observer due to the direct sound and the echo reflected from a building behind the truck. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a source of sound is moving towards an observer, the Doppler effect causes the observed frequency to increase, and if it's moving away, the frequency decreases. The formula for Doppler effect when the source is moving towards a stationary observer is f' = f * (v_sound / (v_sound - v_source)), where v_source is the speed of the source towards the observer. Similarly, if the source is moving away, the formula is f' = f * (v_sound / (v_sound + v_source)). \n\nBut wait, in this case, there are two loudspeakers on the truck. One is facing forward (towards the observer) and the other is facing backward. The truck is moving towards the observer, so the front loudspeaker is moving towards the observer, while the back loudspeaker is moving away from the observer? Wait, no. The truck is moving towards the observer, so the back of the truck is moving away from the building behind it. Wait, the echo is reflected from a building behind the truck. So the echo would involve the sound from the back loudspeaker reflecting off the building and then coming back to the observer?\n\nBut the observer is in front of the truck, right? The truck is moving towards the observer. So the observer is in front, and the building is behind the truck. So the direct sound comes from the front loudspeaker, and the echo comes from the back loudspeaker's sound reflecting off the building. But how does that echo reach the observer?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about two separate Doppler shifts for the echo. The sound from the back loudspeaker is emitted towards the building, which is stationary. The building reflects the sound, so the echo is like a reflection. But since the truck is moving towards the observer, the back loudspeaker is moving away from the building. Therefore, when the back loudspeaker emits sound towards the building, the frequency of that sound as received by the building would be Doppler shifted because the source (the back loudspeaker) is moving away from the building. Then, when the building reflects the sound, it acts as a stationary source, so the observer (who is moving towards the building? Wait, the observer is stationary, and the truck is moving towards the observer. Wait, the observer is stationary, and the truck is moving towards them. So the building is behind the truck, so the building is stationary as well. \n\nSo the echo path is: back loudspeaker emits sound towards building, which reflects it back towards the observer. But the observer is in front of the truck, so the reflected sound would have to go from the building to the observer? Wait, but if the truck is moving towards the observer, and the building is behind the truck, then the reflected sound would go from the building to the truck and then... no, the building is behind the truck. So the sound from the back loudspeaker goes to the building, reflects, and then goes back towards the direction from which the truck came? But the observer is in front of the truck. So unless the observer is also behind the building? Wait, no, the problem says the truck is moving towards the observer. So the observer is in front of the truck, and the building is behind the truck. Therefore, the echo from the building would be going away from the observer. Wait, but how would the observer hear the echo? Maybe the problem assumes that the echo is reflected back towards the observer? That would require the building to be in front of the truck? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the setup.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n\"A truck equipped with two loudspeakers on its roof, one facing forward and another facing backward. This truck is moving towards you at a speed of 1 m/s. The loudspeakers both vibrate at a frequency of 1000 Hz. What is the beat frequency heard by an observer, which is formed by the direct sound and the echo reflected from a building behind the truck? It is known that the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, respectively.\"\n\nSo the truck is moving towards the observer (me). The building is behind the truck. The direct sound comes from the front loudspeaker (facing forward, towards me). The echo is from the sound from the back loudspeaker (facing backward, towards the building) reflecting off the building and then coming back... but if the building is behind the truck, then the echo would reflect back towards the direction opposite to where the observer is. Unless the building is positioned such that the echo reflects towards the observer? Maybe the building is not directly behind the truck but somewhere else? Wait, the problem says \"echo reflected from a building behind the truck\". So the building is behind the truck. So the sound from the back loudspeaker goes to the building, reflects, and then... if the observer is in front of the truck, how does the observer hear the echo? Maybe the problem assumes that the echo is reflected back towards the front? That would require the building to be at an angle, but maybe it's a flat building and the sound reflects back along the same path? So if the truck is moving towards me, and the building is directly behind it, then the sound from the back loudspeaker goes straight back to the building, reflects straight back towards the truck, and then maybe continues towards the observer? Wait, but the truck is moving towards the observer, so after reflection, the sound would go back towards the truck's previous position? Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to make some assumptions here.\n\nPerhaps the problem is considering that the echo is heard by the observer because the reflected sound from the building travels back towards the truck's direction, which is towards the observer. So maybe the building is positioned such that the echo comes back towards the observer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the echo is heard by the observer even if it's going in the opposite direction, which doesn't make much sense. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the observer hearing the echo from the building, but the truck itself is between the observer and the building? Wait, no. The truck is moving towards the observer, and the building is behind the truck. So the observer is in front of the truck, and the building is behind. Therefore, the direct sound from the front loudspeaker goes from the truck to the observer. The echo would be from the back loudspeaker's sound going to the building and reflecting. If the building is behind the truck, then the reflected sound would go back towards the direction from which the truck came, i.e., away from the observer. Therefore, the observer would not hear the echo. But the problem says that the observer hears the beat frequency formed by the direct sound and the echo. Therefore, there must be a way for the echo to reach the observer. Maybe the building is not directly behind but at some angle, or maybe the problem is considering that the echo is reflected towards the observer. Maybe it's a typo and the building is in front of the truck? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem says: \"echo reflected from a building behind the truck\". So building is behind the truck. Hmm. Maybe the observer is not in front of the truck but somewhere else? Wait, no, the problem says the truck is moving towards \"you\" (the observer). So the observer is in front of the truck. So unless the building is between the truck and the observer? But the problem says the building is behind the truck. This is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the echo is from the building that is behind the truck, but the sound from the back loudspeaker reflects off the building and then travels back towards the truck's direction, which is towards the observer. So the building is behind the truck, the back loudspeaker emits sound towards the building, which reflects it back towards the truck, which is moving towards the observer. So the reflected sound would then travel towards the observer? Wait, but the truck is in between the building and the observer. So if the sound reflects off the building towards the truck, then the truck is moving towards the observer, so the reflected sound would go from the building to the truck and then... maybe the truck is not blocking it? Or maybe the sound goes past the truck towards the observer? That might be possible. So the sound from the back loudspeaker goes to the building, reflects back towards the truck, goes past the truck (since the truck is moving forward), and reaches the observer. So the observer hears both the direct sound from the front loudspeaker and the echo from the back loudspeaker's sound reflected off the building. That seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, the observer hears two sounds: one directly from the front loudspeaker (which is moving towards the observer) and one from the echo of the back loudspeaker (which first had its sound emitted towards the building, reflected, and then moving towards the observer). Since the truck is moving, both the direct and the echo paths involve Doppler shifts.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, respectively. Wait, originally, they are supposed to vibrate at 1000 Hz, but somehow they are producing different frequencies. Is this due to the Doppler effect? Or is it given that their actual frequencies are 1003 and 997? The problem says \"It is known that the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, respectively.\" So maybe those frequencies already take into account the Doppler effect? Or is that an additional effect?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me parse the problem again:\n\n\"The loudspeakers both vibrate at a frequency of 1000 Hz. What is the beat frequency heard by an observer, which is formed by the direct sound and the echo reflected from a building behind the truck? It is known that the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, respectively.\"\n\nSo the loudspeakers are designed to vibrate at 1000 Hz, but due to the motion of the truck, the actual frequencies produced by them are 1003 and 997 Hz. Therefore, the front loudspeaker, which is facing forward (towards the observer), since the truck is moving towards the observer, its frequency is increased to 1003 Hz. Similarly, the rear loudspeaker, facing backward, since the truck is moving forward, the rear loudspeaker is moving away from the direction it is facing (i.e., the building), so its frequency is decreased to 997 Hz. Therefore, these 1003 and 997 Hz already account for the Doppler effect from the truck's motion. Then, the echo from the building involves another Doppler shift?\n\nWait, but if the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are already 1003 and 997 Hz, then maybe those are the frequencies that are emitted by the loudspeakers. Then, when the rear loudspeaker's sound reflects off the building, there might be another Doppler shift? Or is the echo just the same frequency as the rear loudspeaker? Hmm.\n\nBut if the building is stationary, then when the sound from the rear loudspeaker hits the building, it is reflected back with the same frequency, right? Because the building is stationary. However, if the truck is moving, then during the time the sound is traveling to the building and back, the truck has moved, but if we are considering the frequency of the echo, not the position, then maybe the frequency is the same as the frequency received by the building. However, the frequency received by the building is different from the frequency emitted by the rear loudspeaker, because the rear loudspeaker is moving away from the building. Therefore, the frequency received by the building is lower than the emitted frequency, and then the echo would have that same frequency. But then, when that echo comes back towards the observer, there might be another Doppler shift because the observer is stationary and the source (the building) is stationary, but the truck is moving. Wait, no, the echo is coming from the building, which is stationary. Therefore, the frequency of the echo as heard by the observer would be the same as the frequency that was reflected, unless the observer is moving. But the observer is stationary. Therefore, if the frequency received by the building is f, then the echo heard by the observer is also f. Therefore, the beat frequency would be the difference between the direct sound (front loudspeaker's frequency, 1003 Hz) and the echo (rear loudspeaker's frequency as received by the building, which is different from 997 Hz? Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe rear loudspeaker is moving away from the building, so the frequency of the sound it emits towards the building is Doppler shifted. The formula for the frequency received by a stationary observer (the building) when the source is moving away is f' = f * (v_sound / (v_sound + v_source)). Here, the source is the rear loudspeaker, moving away from the building at 1 m/s. The emitted frequency by the loudspeaker is given as 997 Hz. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"It is known that the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, respectively.\" So does that mean that the frequencies emitted by the loudspeakers are already 1003 and 997, taking into account the Doppler effect from the truck's motion? Or is it that the loudspeakers are emitting 1000 Hz, but due to the truck's motion, the observed frequencies are 1003 and 997?\n\nThis is critical. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"The loudspeakers both vibrate at a frequency of 1000 Hz. What is the beat frequency heard by an observer, which is formed by the direct sound and the echo reflected from a building behind the truck? It is known that the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, respectively.\"\n\nSo the loudspeakers are designed to vibrate at 1000 Hz, but the frequencies produced (i.e., the actual frequencies emitted) are 1003 and 997. This suggests that the motion of the truck causes the loudspeakers to produce different frequencies? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Loudspeakers produce a frequency based on the electrical signal they receive. If the truck is moving, that shouldn't change the frequency of the sound they emit. Unless there's something else going on. Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that due to the Doppler effect, the frequencies heard by the observer from the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 and 997 Hz. But the problem says \"frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers\", which might be ambiguous. It could mean the frequencies emitted by the loudspeakers, which would be 1000 Hz, but due to the Doppler effect, the observer hears different frequencies. However, the problem states that the frequencies produced are 1003 and 997, so maybe it's saying that due to the motion of the truck, the loudspeakers' emitted frequencies are shifted? But how?\n\nWait, maybe the loudspeakers are fixed to the truck, and as the truck moves, the motion affects the emitted frequency? No, that's not how sound works. The frequency of the sound emitted by a source depends on the source's motion relative to the medium (air). If the source is moving towards the medium, it compresses the waves in front, increasing the frequency. But the loudspeaker is vibrating at 1000 Hz in its own frame. So in the frame of the truck, the loudspeakers emit 1000 Hz. However, in the frame of the observer (or the air), the frequency is different due to the Doppler effect. Therefore, the front loudspeaker, moving towards the observer, emits a higher frequency, and the rear loudspeaker, moving away from the building, emits a lower frequency. Therefore, the \"frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers\" as heard by the observer (or by the building) are 1003 and 997 Hz. Therefore, the problem is giving us those Doppler-shifted frequencies already. Therefore, the direct sound from the front loudspeaker is 1003 Hz, and the echo from the rear loudspeaker is...?\n\nWait, the echo is the sound from the rear loudspeaker reflected off the building. The rear loudspeaker emits 997 Hz towards the building. The building reflects it, so the echo is also 997 Hz. However, if the truck is moving towards the observer, then when the echo is traveling back towards the observer, is there another Doppler shift? Because the echo is coming from the building, which is stationary, so if the observer is stationary, then the frequency of the echo would still be 997 Hz. Therefore, the beat frequency would be the difference between 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, which is 6 Hz. But that seems too straightforward, and maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but if the echo is from the rear loudspeaker, which is moving, then when the sound is reflected, does the motion of the truck affect the echo? Let me think. The rear loudspeaker is moving away from the building as it emits the sound. The frequency of the sound reaching the building is 997 Hz, as given. The building reflects it, so the reflected sound has the same frequency, 997 Hz, traveling back towards the direction from which it came. However, the truck is moving towards the observer, so the reflected sound is now traveling towards the truck, which is moving towards the observer. But the observer is stationary. Wait, the reflected sound is going from the building towards the truck's previous position? Or is the truck moving away from the reflected sound? Wait, the truck is moving towards the observer, so away from the building. Therefore, when the sound is reflected from the building, it is going towards the truck's previous position, but the truck has moved forward. However, the observer is in front of the truck. So the reflected sound is going away from the observer. Wait, this brings me back to the earlier confusion: how does the observer hear the echo?\n\nIf the echo is going from the building back towards the direction the truck came from, which is away from the observer, then the observer wouldn't hear it. Unless the echo is somehow redirected towards the observer. Maybe the problem assumes that the echo is reflected back towards the observer? For example, if the building is not directly behind the truck but at an angle such that the echo is reflected towards the observer. In that case, the echo would be traveling from the building towards the observer, and since the truck is moving towards the observer, the source of the original sound (the rear loudspeaker) is moving towards or away from the building?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to consider standard Doppler effect scenarios for echoes. Normally, when a sound reflects off a moving object, there can be two Doppler shifts, but in this case, the building is stationary. So the process is: moving source emits sound, stationary building reflects it, so the echo is like a stationary source. However, during the reflection, the source was moving. But once it's reflected, the echo is just a sound wave from a stationary source (the building) with the same frequency as the incident sound. However, if the observer is moving relative to the building, then there would be another Doppler shift. But in this problem, the observer is stationary.\n\nBut if the echo is going in a different direction, how does it reach the observer? Maybe the problem is assuming that the echo is reflected back along the same path, so the sound from the rear loudspeaker goes to the building and reflects back towards the truck. Then, since the truck is moving towards the observer, that reflected sound is moving towards the truck, which is moving towards the observer. However, the observer is not on the truck. So unless the observer is on the truck, which they are not. Wait, this is really confusing. Let me try to think of it as two separate Doppler effects for the echo.\n\nFirst, the rear loudspeaker is moving away from the building, emitting sound towards it. The frequency received by the building is f1 = f_rear * (v_sound / (v_sound + v_truck)). Then, the building reflects the sound, which now acts as a new source. If the observer is stationary, and the reflected sound is going back towards the original direction of the truck (i.e., away from the observer), then the observer would not hear it. However, if the reflected sound is going towards the observer, then we have another Doppler shift because the source (the building) is stationary, and the observer is stationary, so the frequency remains f1. But how does the sound get to the observer? Maybe the problem is considering that the echo is reflected back towards the observer, implying that the building is in front of the truck? But the problem says the building is behind the truck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Perhaps the building is in front of the truck, so that the echo from the front loudspeaker is considered. But the problem says the building is behind the truck. Alternatively, maybe the observer is not stationary? No, the problem says the truck is moving towards the observer, implying the observer is stationary.\n\nWait, maybe the key here is that the echo is not from the building behind the truck, but the truck is moving towards the building, which is in front? But the problem says \"building behind the truck\". Let me check once more.\n\nOriginal problem: \"echo reflected from a building behind the truck\". So building is behind the truck. The truck is moving towards the observer, so the observer is in front. The direct sound is from the front loudspeaker, moving towards the observer, with frequency 1003 Hz. The echo is from the back loudspeaker's sound reflecting off the building behind the truck. If the observer is to hear that echo, the sound must be reflected towards the observer. If the building is directly behind the truck, then the echo would be reflected back along the same path, i.e., back towards the direction the truck came from, which is away from the observer. Therefore, the observer wouldn't hear it. Therefore, there must be some other configuration. Perhaps the building is not directly behind but at an angle where the echo reflects towards the observer. For simplicity, maybe we assume that the echo is reflected towards the observer, so that we can calculate its frequency.\n\nAssuming that, then the echo's frequency would be the same as the frequency received by the building, which is the frequency emitted by the rear loudspeaker Doppler shifted due to the truck moving away from the building. Then, since the building reflects it towards the observer, and the observer is stationary, the echo's frequency is that same Doppler-shifted frequency. Therefore, the beat frequency is the difference between the direct sound (1003 Hz) and the echo (which we need to calculate).\n\nBut the problem says \"It is known that the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, respectively.\" So maybe those are the frequencies after Doppler shift? That is, the front loudspeaker's frequency as heard by the observer is 1003 Hz, and the rear loudspeaker's frequency as heard by the building is 997 Hz. Then, if the echo is reflected towards the observer, the observer would hear that same 997 Hz. Therefore, the beat frequency is 1003 - 997 = 6 Hz. But this seems too simple, and maybe the problem expects more steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1003 Hz and 997 Hz are the source frequencies in their own frames, and we need to apply Doppler shifts for both the direct and the echo paths. Let's try this approach.\n\nFirst, let's clarify: are the 1003 Hz and 997 Hz the frequencies emitted by the loudspeakers, or the frequencies heard by the observer? The problem states: \"The loudspeakers both vibrate at a frequency of 1000 Hz. What is the beat frequency heard by an observer... It is known that the frequencies produced by the front and rear loudspeakers are 1003 Hz and 997 Hz, respectively.\"\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. If \"frequencies produced\" refers to the frequencies emitted by the loudspeakers, then they are 1003 and 997, which would mean that the truck's motion has somehow altered the emitted frequency, which is not standard. Normally, the emitted frequency is determined by the source's vibration, independent of its motion. However, if the problem is saying that due to the truck's motion, the observed frequencies (i.e., the frequencies heard by the observer) are 1003 and 997, then we can work with that.\n\nLet me assume that the 1003 Hz is the frequency heard by the observer from the front loudspeaker, and 997 Hz is the frequency heard by the building from the rear loudspeaker. Then, the echo, when reflected back to the observer, would have the same frequency as what the building received, which is 997 Hz. Therefore, the beat frequency is 1003 - 997 = 6 Hz. But let's verify this with Doppler calculations.\n\nLet me do the Doppler calculations to see if the given frequencies make sense. Let's assume the speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s at 20°C, which is a standard value. Let's check the front loudspeaker: the truck is moving towards the observer at 1 m/s, emitting a frequency of 1000 Hz. The observed frequency would be f' = f * (v_sound / (v_sound - v_source)) = 1000 * (343 / (343 - 1)) = 1000 * (343 / 342) ≈ 1000 * 1.00292 ≈ 1002.92 Hz ≈ 1003 Hz. Okay, that matches the given 1003 Hz. Similarly, for the rear loudspeaker, which is moving away from the building. The frequency received by the building would be f' = f * (v_sound / (v_sound + v_source)) = 1000 * (343 / (343 + 1)) = 1000 * (343 / 344) ≈ 1000 * 0.99709 ≈ 997.09 Hz ≈ 997 Hz. So that matches the given 997 Hz. Therefore, the problem is telling us that the front loudspeaker's sound, when heard by the observer, is 1003 Hz due to the Doppler effect, and the rear loudspeaker's sound, when heard by the building, is 997 Hz due to the Doppler effect. Now, the echo is the sound that was received by the building (997 Hz) reflected back. Assuming the building reflects it without any change in frequency (since it's stationary), then the echo is 997 Hz. Now, how does this echo reach the observer?\n\nIf the echo is going back towards the truck's original direction, away from the observer, then the observer wouldn't hear it. However, if the echo is reflected towards the observer, then the observer would hear it as 997 Hz. Assuming that the problem intends for us to consider that the echo is indeed reflected towards the observer, then the beat frequency is the difference between the direct sound (1003 Hz) and the echo (997 Hz), which is 6 Hz. Therefore, the beat frequency is 6 Hz.\n\nBut let me think again: if the echo is reflected towards the observer, does the motion of the truck affect the echo's frequency? For example, if the echo is going from the building towards the truck, which is moving towards the observer, then the truck would be moving towards the echo, causing a Doppler shift. But the observer is not on the truck. The echo is going from the building to somewhere, but the observer is stationary. If the echo is going directly to the observer, then since the building is stationary and the observer is stationary, the frequency remains 997 Hz. If the echo is going past the truck towards the observer, then the truck's motion doesn't affect it. Therefore, the echo frequency is indeed 997 Hz. Therefore, the beat frequency is 1003 - 997 = 6 Hz.\n\nBut let me check if there is another Doppler shift when the echo comes back to the observer. Suppose the echo is reflected from the building and then travels back towards the observer. If during the time between the sound being emitted and the echo being heard, the truck has moved, does that affect the frequency? No, because the Doppler effect depends on the relative motion between the source and the observer at the time of emission and reception. In this case, the echo is a sound wave emitted by the building (stationary), so its frequency is 997 Hz, and since the observer is stationary, there's no Doppler shift. Therefore, the echo is heard at 997 Hz.\n\nTherefore, beat frequency is 1003 - 997 = 6 Hz. However, I need to make sure that there isn't another Doppler shift when the echo is reflected. For example, sometimes when you have a moving source and a reflector, you get a double Doppler shift. Let me recall: if a sound is emitted by a moving source, hits a moving reflector, and then is received by a moving observer, there are two Doppler shifts. But in this case, the reflector (building) is stationary, and the observer is stationary. So only one Doppler shift occurs when the source (rear loudspeaker) is moving away from the building. Therefore, the frequency of the echo is 997 Hz. So beat frequency is 6 Hz.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the beat frequency heard by an observer, which is formed by the direct sound and the echo reflected from a building behind the truck\". If the echo is indeed 997 Hz and the direct sound is 1003 Hz, then yes, the beat frequency is 6 Hz. However, I want to check if there is a miscalculation here. For example, if the echo is not 997 Hz but something else.\n\nWait, let's think again: the rear loudspeaker emits sound at 1000 Hz in its own frame. Because the truck is moving towards the observer at 1 m/s, the rear loudspeaker is moving away from the building at 1 m/s. Therefore, the frequency of the sound received by the building is f = f0 * (v_sound / (v_sound + v_source)) = 1000 * (343 / 344) ≈ 997.09 Hz ≈ 997 Hz. Then, the building reflects it, so the echo has the same frequency, 997 Hz, traveling back towards... where? If it's reflected back towards the truck, then the truck is moving towards the observer, so the echo is moving towards the truck which is moving away from the echo. If someone on the truck hears it, they would hear a Doppler shift. But the observer is not on the truck. If the echo is reflected back towards the original direction of the truck (i.e., towards where the truck came from), then the observer, who is in front of the truck, wouldn't hear it. However, if the echo is reflected towards the observer, then the observer hears 997 Hz. Given that the problem says the observer does hear it, we have to assume that. Therefore, beat frequency is 6 Hz.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose we don't assume the given frequencies and do all calculations from scratch. Let's say the speed of sound is 343 m/s.\n\nFront loudspeaker: source moving towards observer at 1 m/s, emitting 1000 Hz. Observed frequency is f' = f * (v / (v - vs)) = 1000 * (343 / (343 - 1)) ≈ 1000 * 343 / 342 ≈ 1002.92 Hz ≈ 1003 Hz. Which matches the given value.\n\nRear loudspeaker: source moving away from building at 1 m/s, emitting 1000 Hz. Frequency received by building is f'' = f * (v / (v + vs)) = 1000 * (343 / (343 + 1)) ≈ 997.09 Hz ≈ 997 Hz. Then, if the building reflects it back towards the observer, the frequency remains 997 Hz because the building is stationary. Therefore, the observer hears two frequencies: 1003 Hz directly from the front loudspeaker and 997 Hz from the echo. The beat frequency is the difference: 1003 - 997 = 6 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6 Hz.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when the echo is reflected, if the truck is moving towards the observer, then during the time the sound travels to the building and back, the truck has moved. However, beat frequency depends on the instantaneous frequencies, not the positions. Since both the direct sound and the echo are continuous sounds, their frequencies are constant (assuming the truck's speed is constant), so the beat frequency is just the difference. Therefore, 6 Hz.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 6 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe beat frequency heard by the observer is \\boxed{6} Hz.\n</think>"}
