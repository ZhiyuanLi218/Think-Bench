{"question":"The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2.

Let me start by recalling what makes a good nucleophile in aqueous solutions. Since water is a polar protic solvent, the nucleophilicity can be influenced by the solvent's ability to solvate the nucleophiles. In polar protic solvents, larger and less charged nucleophiles are generally better because they are less solvated, making them more available to attack the electrophile.\n\nFirst, let's list out the nucleophiles given:\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)\n3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)\n4. Methanol (CH₃OH)\n5. Ethanethiolate (CH₂CH₂S⁻)\n\nNow, I need to consider their basicity and size. In polar protic solvents like water, the nucleophilicity order is often the reverse of basicity for similar species. For example, among halides, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻ because it's less solvated despite being less basic. But for different functional groups, I need to compare their basicity and size.\n\nLet me think about each one:\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide. Alkoxides are generally strong bases and good nucleophiles. But compared to other species here, how does it rank?\n\n2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): Hydroxide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In polar protic solvents, its nucleophilicity is high.\n\n3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): This is a carboxylate anion. Carboxylates are weaker bases than alkoxides but stronger than, say, thiols. However, in polar protic solvents, their nucleophilicity might be lower than hydroxide.\n\n4. Methanol (CH₃OH): Methanol is neutral. Since it's a neutral molecule, it's less likely to be a good nucleophile compared to anions. But in some cases, the conjugate base (like methoxide) is a better nucleophile.\n\n5. Ethanethiolate (CH₂CH₂S⁻): Thiols are weaker acids than alcohols, so their conjugate bases (thiolates) are stronger bases. In polar protic solvents, thiols (like ethanethiolate) are better nucleophiles than alkoxides because they are larger and less solvated. So ethanethiolate should be more nucleophilic than hydroxide or alkoxide.\n\nLet me recall the general order for nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents. For similar species, the order is typically:\n\nRS⁻ > RO⁻ > ROH (neutral) > RCOO⁻\n\nBut wait, in polar protic solvents, larger anions are better nucleophiles because they are less solvated. So thiolate (RS⁻) is better than alkoxide (RO⁻), which is better than carboxylate (RCOO⁻). Hydroxide is an alkoxide, so it's more nucleophilic than propionate (a carboxylate). Methanol is neutral and a weak nucleophile.\n\nSo the order from most to least reactive in aqueous solution would be:\n\nEthanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4)\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the specific examples. For example, in the SN1 reaction, the nucleophilicity of different nucleophiles in aqueous solution can be ranked. For example, in the case of comparing RS⁻ and RO⁻, RS⁻ is a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents because of its larger size and less solvation.\n\nSo ethanethiolate (5) is more nucleophilic than hydroxide (2), which is more nucleophilic than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), which is more nucleophilic than propionate (3), and methanol (4) is the weakest.\n\nSo the correct order would be 5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4, which corresponds to option D:5, 2, 1, 3 and 4.\n\nWait, but let me check the options given:\n\nA:5, 2, 3, 1 and 4\n\nB:2, 5, 3, 4 and 3\n\nC:2, 5, 1, 4 and 3\n\nD:5, 2, 1, 3 and 4\n\nSo option D is 5, 2, 1, 3, 4 which matches the order I came up with.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (an alkoxide) more nucleophilic than propionate (a carboxylate)?\n\nYes, because alkoxides are stronger bases and in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order is often related to basicity but also size. Since carboxylates are weaker bases than alkoxides, they are less nucleophilic. So the order would be alkoxide > carboxylate.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (alkoxide) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol), which is option D.\n</think>"}
