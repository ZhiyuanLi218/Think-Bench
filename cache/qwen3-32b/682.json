Points D and E are on AB such that CD and CE trisect angle C, and the ratio DE/BE is 8/15. I need to find tan B in the specified form and compute m + n + p. Let me start by visualizing the problem.\n\nFirst, let me sketch triangle ABC with right angle at C. So, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. Points D and E are somewhere on AB between A and B. The lines CD and CE trisect angle C, which is 90 degrees. So, trisecting a 90-degree angle would mean each trisection angle is 30 degrees. Wait, but trisecting 90 degrees would divide it into three equal angles of 30 degrees each. So angle DCE and angle ECD? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nSince CD and CE trisect angle C, that means angle ACD, angle DCE, and angle ECB are all equal. Since angle C is 90 degrees, each angle would be 30 degrees. Therefore, angle ACD = 30 degrees, angle DCE = 30 degrees, and angle ECB = 30 degrees. Therefore, CD is the angle bisector of the first trisection, and CE is the angle bisector of the second trisection? Wait, no. If they trisect angle C, then CD and CE divide angle C into three equal parts. So starting from side AC, first trisection is angle ACD = 30 degrees, then angle DCE = 30 degrees, then angle ECB = 30 degrees. So CE is making a 60-degree angle with AC, and CD is making a 30-degree angle with AC. So CD and CE are two lines from C to AB such that they create angles of 30 and 60 degrees with AC.\n\nGiven that, I need to find tan B. Let me recall that in a right triangle, tan B is AC / BC. Wait, no. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C, tan B is opposite over adjacent, which is AC / BC. Wait, angle B is at point B, so the sides opposite to B is AC, and adjacent is BC. So yes, tan B = AC / BC. But maybe I need to find the ratio of AC to BC given the trisection condition and the ratio DE / BE = 8/15.\n\nSo perhaps I need to assign coordinates or use trigonometry to find relations between the sides. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote AC = b, BC = a, so that tan B = AC / BC = b / a. Our goal is to find b / a.\n\nSince angle C is 90 degrees, AB = sqrt(a² + b²). Points D and E are on AB such that CD and CE trisect angle C. Let me think about how to find coordinates of D and E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem or some trigonometric identities.\n\nBut since CD and CE are trisectors, maybe I can use the formula for the length of angle bisectors? Wait, but they are not bisectors, they are trisectors. The angle trisection is more complicated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me place point C at (0, 0), point B at (a, 0), and point A at (0, b). Then AB is the hypotenuse from (0, b) to (a, 0). The equation of AB can be found.\n\nFirst, coordinates:\n\nC: (0, 0)\n\nA: (0, b)\n\nB: (a, 0)\n\nThen AB has slope (0 - b)/(a - 0) = -b/a, so equation is y = (-b/a)x + b.\n\nPoints D and E lie on AB. Let me parametrize AB. Let me use a parameter t for points on AB. Let me let t be the parameter such that when t = 0, we are at A (0, b), and when t = 1, we are at B (a, 0). So the coordinates of a general point on AB can be written as (a*t, b*(1 - t)). Wait, let me check:\n\nAt t = 0: (0, b) which is A. At t = 1: (a, 0) which is B. So yes, parametric equations x = a*t, y = b*(1 - t). So points D and E correspond to some parameters t1 and t2 (with t1 < t2 since D is between A and E). Then D is (a*t1, b*(1 - t1)), E is (a*t2, b*(1 - t2)).\n\nNow, CD and CE make angles of 30 degrees and 60 degrees with AC. Wait, AC is along the y-axis from C(0,0) to A(0, b). So angle between CD and AC is 30 degrees. Similarly, angle between CE and AC is 60 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, since angle between CD and the y-axis is 30 degrees, so the line CD makes 30 degrees with the y-axis. Similarly, CE makes 60 degrees with the y-axis.\n\nAlternatively, since angle between CD and the x-axis? Let me think. Since AC is along the y-axis, angle between CD and AC is 30 degrees, so the angle between CD and the y-axis is 30 degrees. Therefore, the angle between CD and the x-axis is 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. Similarly, CE makes 60 degrees with AC (the y-axis), so angle between CE and x-axis is 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. Wait, but CE is closer to the x-axis? Wait, if angle between CE and AC is 60 degrees, then since AC is vertical, CE is going towards AB, which is going from A(0, b) to B(a, 0). So if CE is making 60 degrees with AC (the y-axis), then it is going more towards the x-axis. Similarly, CD is making 30 degrees with AC, so it is going less towards the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, line CD makes an angle of 60 degrees with the x-axis? Wait, if angle between CD and y-axis is 30 degrees, then angle between CD and x-axis is 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. Similarly, angle between CE and y-axis is 60 degrees, so angle between CE and x-axis is 30 degrees. Therefore, lines CD and CE have slopes tan(60°) and tan(30°), respectively.\n\nWait, slope of CD is tan(60°) = √3, and slope of CE is tan(30°) = 1/√3.\n\nBut CD is a line from C(0, 0) to D on AB. Similarly, CE is from C(0, 0) to E on AB. Therefore, we can find equations for CD and CE and find their intersection points with AB.\n\nSo line CD has slope √3, so its equation is y = √3 x. Line CE has slope 1/√3, so its equation is y = (1/√3)x.\n\nNow, find intersection points D and E of these lines with AB.\n\nEquation of AB: y = (-b/a)x + b.\n\nFind intersection of y = √3 x with AB:\n\nSet √3 x = (-b/a)x + b\n\n=> √3 x + (b/a)x = b\n\n=> x(√3 + b/a) = b\n\n=> x = b / (√3 + b/a) = (ab) / (a√3 + b)\n\nSimilarly, y-coordinate is √3 x = √3 * (ab) / (a√3 + b)\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are:\n\nx_D = (ab) / (a√3 + b)\n\ny_D = (√3 ab) / (a√3 + b)\n\nSimilarly for E, which is intersection of y = (1/√3)x with AB:\n\nSet (1/√3)x = (-b/a)x + b\n\nMultiply both sides by √3:\n\nx = - (b/a)√3 x + b√3\n\nBring terms together:\n\nx + (b/a)√3 x = b√3\n\nx [1 + (b√3)/a] = b√3\n\nx = [b√3] / [1 + (b√3)/a] = [b√3] / [(a + b√3)/a] ] = [a b √3] / [a + b√3]\n\nSimilarly, y_E = (1/√3)x = (1/√3) * [a b √3]/[a + b√3] = [a b]/[a + b√3]\n\nTherefore, coordinates of E:\n\nx_E = [a b √3]/[a + b√3]\n\ny_E = [a b]/[a + b√3]\n\nNow, we have coordinates of D and E. Now we need to compute DE and BE, then take their ratio.\n\nFirst, let's compute DE. Since D and E are on AB, which is a straight line, so DE can be calculated by distance between D and E.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is parameterized, maybe we can find t1 and t2 and compute DE in terms of AB's length? But maybe coordinates are easier.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nFor D: (ab/(a√3 + b), √3 ab/(a√3 + b))\n\nFor E: (a b √3 / (a + b√3), a b / (a + b√3))\n\nLet me denote denominator for D as a√3 + b, and for E as a + b√3. Let me compute coordinates numerically.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me compute x_D and x_E:\n\nx_D = (ab)/(a√3 + b)\n\nx_E = (ab√3)/(a + b√3)\n\nSimilarly for y-coordinates.\n\nTo compute DE, need to find sqrt[(x_E - x_D)^2 + (y_E - y_D)^2]. But since AB is a straight line, DE is also along AB, so maybe we can compute the distance as a fraction of AB?\n\nAlternatively, since AB has length sqrt(a² + b²), but maybe we can compute DE by difference in parameters? Wait, if we use the parameter t for AB, as earlier, points D and E correspond to certain t values. However, since we have coordinates, maybe we can compute the ratio DE / BE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute DE and BE using coordinates.\n\nFirst, let me compute coordinates of B: (a, 0)\n\nCoordinates of E: ( (ab√3)/(a + b√3), (ab)/(a + b√3) )\n\nSo vector BE is from E to B: (a - x_E, 0 - y_E)\n\nTherefore, BE length is sqrt[(a - x_E)^2 + ( - y_E)^2]\n\nSimilarly for DE.\n\nBut this might get messy. Alternatively, since AB is a straight line, maybe we can find the ratio of lengths by looking at the parameter t?\n\nEarlier, I had parametrized AB as (a t, b(1 - t)), with t from 0 to 1. Let me see if points D and E correspond to certain t values.\n\nFor point D, which is intersection of y = √3 x with AB.\n\nFrom earlier, coordinates of D are (ab/(a√3 + b), √3 ab/(a√3 + b)).\n\nComparing with parametrization x = a t, y = b(1 - t):\n\nSo equate x-coordinate:\n\na t = ab/(a√3 + b)\n\n=> t = b/(a√3 + b)\n\nSimilarly, check y-coordinate:\n\nb(1 - t) = b(1 - b/(a√3 + b)) = b [ (a√3 + b - b)/ (a√3 + b) ) ] = b [ a√3 / (a√3 + b) ) ] = (ab√3)/(a√3 + b)\n\nWhich matches the y-coordinate of D, which is √3 ab/(a√3 + b). Since √3 ab/(a√3 + b) equals (ab√3)/(a√3 + b). So yes, t for D is t_D = b/(a√3 + b)\n\nSimilarly for E: coordinates are (a b √3 / (a + b√3), a b / (a + b√3))\n\nCompare with parametrization x = a t, y = b(1 - t):\n\nx_E = a t_E = (ab√3)/(a + b√3) => t_E = [b√3]/[a + b√3]\n\nSimilarly, check y_E: b(1 - t_E) = b[1 - (b√3)/(a + b√3)] = b [ (a + b√3 - b√3)/ (a + b√3) ) ] = b [ a / (a + b√3) ) ] = (ab)/(a + b√3), which matches. So t_E = [b√3]/[a + b√3]\n\nTherefore, the parameters for D and E are t_D = b/(a√3 + b) and t_E = (b√3)/(a + b√3). Now, since AB is parameterized from t=0 to t=1, and D is between A and E, so t_D < t_E?\n\nWait, need to check if t_D < t_E. Let me compute t_D and t_E.\n\nLet me denote t_D = b / (a√3 + b)\n\nt_E = (b√3) / (a + b√3)\n\nCompare t_D and t_E:\n\nLet me cross multiply:\n\nCompare b*(a + b√3) vs (b√3)*(a√3 + b)\n\nLeft side: ab + b²√3\n\nRight side: b√3 * a√3 + b√3 * b = ab*3 + b²√3\n\nTherefore, Left side: ab + b²√3 vs Right side: 3ab + b²√3\n\nTherefore, Left side is less than Right side, since ab < 3ab (assuming a and b positive). Therefore, t_D < t_E. Therefore, D is between A and E, as given. Good.\n\nTherefore, the length DE can be calculated as the difference in parameters times the length of AB? Wait, no, because in the parametrization, t is not necessarily proportional to distance unless AB is parameterized by arc length, which it isn't. However, since AB is a straight line, the distance between two points with parameters t1 and t2 is |t2 - t1| multiplied by the length of AB. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, in our parametrization, when t goes from 0 to 1, the point moves from A to B. However, the parameter t is not necessarily proportional to distance unless AB is parameterized linearly with respect to distance. However, in our case, x(t) = a t, y(t) = b(1 - t). The derivative dx/dt = a, dy/dt = -b. So the speed is sqrt(a² + b²), which is constant. Therefore, this is a linear parameterization with respect to distance. Therefore, the distance from A to a point with parameter t is t * AB. Therefore, the distance between two points with parameters t1 and t2 is |t2 - t1| * AB. Therefore, DE = |t_E - t_D| * AB, and BE = |t_B - t_E| * AB, where t_B = 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio DE / BE is |t_E - t_D| / |1 - t_E|.\n\nSince t_E < 1, it's (t_E - t_D) / (1 - t_E). Given that DE / BE = 8 / 15, so:\n\n(t_E - t_D) / (1 - t_E) = 8 / 15.\n\nSo now, let's compute t_E - t_D and 1 - t_E.\n\nFirst, compute t_E - t_D:\n\nt_E - t_D = [ (b√3)/(a + b√3) ] - [ b/(a√3 + b) ]\n\nLet me compute this expression. Let me denote denominator terms:\n\nLet me note that denominators are a + b√3 and a√3 + b. Let me compute t_E - t_D:\n\nLet me write both terms with common denominators. Let me compute:\n\nNumerator:\n\nb√3*(a√3 + b) - b*(a + b√3)\n\nDenominator:\n\n(a + b√3)(a√3 + b)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term: b√3*(a√3 + b) = b√3 * a√3 + b√3 * b = ab * 3 + b²√3\n\nSecond term: -b*(a + b√3) = -ab - b²√3\n\nTherefore, numerator is:\n\n(ab * 3 + b²√3) - ab - b²√3 = 3ab - ab + b²√3 - b²√3 = 2ab.\n\nTherefore, t_E - t_D = 2ab / [ (a + b√3)(a√3 + b) ]\n\nNow compute denominator (a + b√3)(a√3 + b). Let me compute this:\n\nMultiply (a + b√3)(a√3 + b):\n\n= a * a√3 + a * b + b√3 * a√3 + b√3 * b\n\n= a²√3 + ab + a b * 3 + b²√3\n\n= a²√3 + ab + 3ab + b²√3\n\n= a²√3 + 4ab + b²√3\n\nTherefore, t_E - t_D = 2ab / [a²√3 + 4ab + b²√3]\n\nNow compute 1 - t_E:\n\n1 - t_E = 1 - [ (b√3)/(a + b√3) ] = [ (a + b√3) - b√3 ] / (a + b√3 ) = a / (a + b√3 )\n\nTherefore, the ratio DE / BE is [2ab / (a²√3 + 4ab + b²√3 ) ] / [ a / (a + b√3 ) ] = [2ab / denominator ] * [ (a + b√3 ) / a ] = 2b (a + b√3 ) / denominator.\n\nSo:\n\nDE / BE = [2b(a + b√3 ) ] / [a²√3 + 4ab + b²√3 ]\n\nLet me compute denominator:\n\na²√3 + 4ab + b²√3 = √3 (a² + b²) + 4ab.\n\nTherefore, DE / BE = [2b(a + b√3 ) ] / [ √3 (a² + b²) + 4ab ] = 8/15.\n\nSo now, set up the equation:\n\n[2b(a + b√3 ) ] / [ √3 (a² + b²) + 4ab ] = 8 / 15\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n15 * 2b(a + b√3 ) = 8 [ √3 (a² + b²) + 4ab ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n30b(a + b√3 ) = 8√3 (a² + b²) + 32ab\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n30b * a + 30b * b√3 = 30ab + 30√3 b²\n\nSo:\n\n30ab + 30√3 b² = 8√3 (a² + b²) + 32ab\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n30ab + 30√3 b² - 8√3 (a² + b²) - 32ab = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(30ab - 32ab) + (30√3 b² - 8√3 a² - 8√3 b²) = 0\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFor ab terms: -2ab\n\nFor √3 terms: 30√3 b² - 8√3 b² = 22√3 b² - 8√3 a²\n\nTherefore:\n\n-2ab + 22√3 b² - 8√3 a² = 0\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n-8√3 a² - 2ab + 22√3 b² = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n8√3 a² + 2ab - 22√3 b² = 0\n\nLet me divide both sides by 2 to simplify:\n\n4√3 a² + ab - 11√3 b² = 0\n\nSo, 4√3 a² + ab - 11√3 b² = 0.\n\nNow, this is an equation relating a and b. Let me recall that tan B = AC / BC = b / a. Let me set k = b / a. Then b = k a. Let me substitute into the equation.\n\nLet me substitute b = k a into the equation:\n\n4√3 a² + a*(k a) - 11√3 (k a)^2 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n4√3 a² + k a² - 11√3 k² a² = 0\n\nDivide both sides by a² (since a ≠ 0):\n\n4√3 + k - 11√3 k² = 0\n\nSo:\n\n-11√3 k² + k + 4√3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n11√3 k² - k - 4√3 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in k:\n\n11√3 k² - k - 4√3 = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n11√3 k² - k - 4√3 = 0\n\nLet me solve for k using quadratic formula. Let me denote:\n\nA = 11√3, B = -1, C = -4√3\n\nThen k = [1 ± sqrt(1^2 - 4 * 11√3 * (-4√3))]/(2 * 11√3)\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = B² - 4AC = 1 - 4*(11√3)*(-4√3) = 1 + 4*11√3*4√3\n\nCompute 4*11*4*(√3)^2 = 16*11*3 = 16*33 = 528\n\nTherefore, D = 1 + 528 = 529\n\nsqrt(D) = sqrt(529) = 23\n\nTherefore, k = [1 ± 23]/(2 * 11√3)\n\nCompute both possibilities:\n\nFirst, with +:\n\nk = (1 + 23)/(22√3) = 24/(22√3) = 12/(11√3) = rationalize denominator: 12√3/(11*3) = 4√3 / 11\n\nSecond, with -:\n\nk = (1 - 23)/(22√3) = (-22)/(22√3) = -1/√3. Since lengths are positive, k = b/a must be positive, so discard negative solution.\n\nTherefore, k = 4√3 / 11\n\nTherefore, tan B = b/a = 4√3 / 11\n\nSo m = 4, p = 3, n = 11. Check if they are relatively prime. 4 and 11 are coprime, 3 is square-free. So m + n + p = 4 + 11 + 3 = 18.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations again because sometimes I might have messed up signs or coefficients.\n\nLet me check the quadratic equation step again. Original equation after substitution:\n\n4√3 + k - 11√3 k² = 0 => rearranged as -11√3 k² + k + 4√3 = 0. Multiply by -1: 11√3 k² - k - 4√3 = 0. Correct.\n\nDiscriminant D = (-1)^2 - 4*(11√3)*(-4√3). Wait, hold on! Wait quadratic formula is for Ax² + Bx + C = 0, discriminant is B² - 4AC. However, in this case, equation is 11√3 k² - k - 4√3 = 0. Therefore, A = 11√3, B = -1, C = -4√3. Therefore discriminant is B² - 4AC = (-1)^2 - 4*(11√3)*(-4√3) = 1 - 4*(11√3)*(-4√3). Wait, but 4AC is 4*(11√3)*(-4√3). Therefore discriminant is 1 - [4*(11√3)*(-4√3)] = 1 + 4*(11√3)*(4√3). Which is 1 + 4*11*4*(√3)^2. Which is 1 + 16*11*3. Wait 16*11 is 176, 176*3 is 528. Then 1 + 528 = 529. Correct. sqrt(529)=23. Correct.\n\nThen k = [1 ± 23]/(2 * 11√3). So positive solution is 24/(22√3) = 12/(11√3) = 4√3/11. Correct. Therefore tan B = 4√3 / 11. Therefore m = 4, n = 11, p = 3. They are coprime? 4 and 11 share no common factors. p = 3 is square-free. Therefore answer is 4 + 11 + 3 = 18. Wait, but I need to check if this is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Let me assume tan B = 4√3 / 11. Then let me take a = 11, b = 4√3. Then check if DE / BE = 8/15.\n\nLet me compute with a = 11, b = 4√3.\n\nCompute t_D = b/(a√3 + b) = (4√3)/(11√3 + 4√3) = (4√3)/(15√3) = 4/15\n\nSimilarly t_E = (b√3)/(a + b√3) = (4√3 * √3)/(11 + 4√3 * √3) = (4*3)/(11 + 4*3) = 12/(11 + 12) = 12/23\n\nTherefore, DE / BE = (t_E - t_D)/(1 - t_E) = (12/23 - 4/15)/(1 - 12/23) = [ (180 - 92)/345 ] / (11/23) ) = (88/345) / (11/23) ) = (88/345) * (23/11) ) = (8/15). Correct! Therefore the ratio is indeed 8/15. Therefore, my answer is correct.\n\nTherefore tan B = 4√3 / 11, so m + n + p = 4 + 11 + 3 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{18}\n</think>"}
