The **Arrhenius definition** of a base is a substance that **donates OH⁻ ions** in aqueous solution. However, the **Brønsted-Lowry definition** is more general: a base is a **proton acceptor**, and it may not necessarily donate OH⁻ ions directly.\n\nFor example, **ammonia (NH₃)** is a weak base. It **does not contain OH⁻**, but when dissolved in water, it **accepts a proton** (H⁺) from water, forming **NH₄⁺** and **OH⁻** as a byproduct:\n\n$$\n\\text{NH}_3 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{NH}_4^+ + \\text{OH}^-\n$$\n\nThus, while OH⁻ is present in solution, it is **not directly donated** by the base. Therefore, **Option A is false**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: \"Only strong bases create solutions in which OH⁻ ions are present.\"**\n\nThis is also **false**. **Weak bases**, such as **ammonia (NH₃)** or **acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻)**, **do create OH⁻ ions** in solution, though in **smaller amounts** compared to strong bases. The OH⁻ is produced **indirectly** via the base's reaction with water.\n\nSo, **OH⁻ ions are present in solutions of both strong and weak bases**, just in **different concentrations**. Thus, **Option B is incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: \"Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\"**\n\nThis statement is **true** for all bases. **Conductivity** in aqueous solutions is due to the presence of **ions**. **Strong bases**, like **NaOH** or **KOH**, dissociate **completely** in water, producing a **large number of ions**, which makes the solution a **good conductor**.\n\nOn the other hand, **weak bases** only **partially dissociate**, resulting in **fewer ions** in solution. Therefore, their solutions are **poor conductors** compared to strong bases.\n\nThe phrasing of the statement — \"Only strong bases are good conductors\" — is **logically sound**. It implies that **if a base is a good conductor**, it **must be a strong base**, which is consistent with chemical principles.\n\nThus, **Option C is true** for all bases.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: \"For weak bases, the concentration of the OH⁻ ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution.\"**\n\nThis is **not true**. Weak bases **do not fully dissociate**, meaning they **produce fewer OH⁻ ions** than the initial concentration of the base. For example, if you dissolve **0.1 M NH₃**, the actual [OH⁻] will be **less than 0.1 M**, because only a small fraction of the base reacts with water.\n\nTherefore, **[OH⁻] < [base]** for weak bases, and **Option D is false**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Correct Answer: C**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about which statement is true for all bases. The options are A through D. I need to figure out which one is correct. \n\nFirst, I should recall what I know about bases. Bases are substances that can accept protons (H+ ions) or donate hydroxide ions (OH-) according to the Brønsted-Lowry and Arrhenius definitions. But I remember there are different types of bases, like strong and weak bases, and maybe even those that don't produce OH- directly but can accept H+.\n\nOption A says all bases donate OH- ions into solution. Hmm. Wait, not all bases do that. For example, weak bases like ammonia (NH3) don't donate OH- directly. Instead, they accept a proton to form NH4+, and in the process, they produce OH- by reacting with water. So maybe A is not correct because some bases don't directly donate OH- but produce it through reaction with water.\n\nOption B states that only strong bases create solutions with OH- ions present. That doesn't sound right. Weak bases also produce OH- ions, just not as much as strong bases. For example, ammonia is a weak base and it does increase the concentration of OH- in solution, just not completely. So B is false.\n\nOption C: Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved. Conductivity relates to the presence of ions in solution. Strong bases dissociate completely, producing more ions, so they should conduct electricity well. Weak bases don't dissociate as much, so their solutions would conduct but not as well. So C might be true. But the question is about what's true for all bases. But the statement says \"only strong bases are good conductors\". Wait, but if a weak base is in solution, it's a weak electrolyte, so it's a poor conductor compared to strong ones. So maybe C is correct because strong bases are good conductors, and weak ones are not. But the question is phrased as \"only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\" So yes, that's true because weak bases don't dissociate completely, so they don't have as many ions. So C could be correct. But wait, the question is which is true for all bases. So if the statement says \"only strong bases are good conductors,\" then that implies that weak bases are not. Which is true. So C might be a correct answer.\n\nOption D: For weak bases, the concentration of OH- ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution. Hmm. Let's think. For a weak base, let's take NH3. When it dissolves in water, it reacts with water to form NH4+ and OH-. The reaction is NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH-. The concentration of OH- produced depends on the extent of this reaction. Since it's a weak base, the reaction doesn't go to completion. So the concentration of OH- would be less than the initial concentration of the base. Because each molecule of NH3 can produce at most one OH- if it fully dissociates, but since it doesn't, the OH- concentration is less than the original base concentration. Therefore, D is false because it says the OH- concentration exceeds the base concentration, which can't be. Unless there's some other factor. Wait, but maybe if the base is polybasic? Like maybe if it's a base that can produce more than one OH-? But even then, for a weak base, the dissociation is partial. For example, if you have a weak base like carbonate ion, CO3^2-, which can accept two protons. But even so, in solution, the amount of OH- produced would depend on the stepwise dissociation. But generally, for a weak base, the OH- concentration is less than the initial concentration of the base. So D is false.\n\nSo reviewing the options:\n\nA: Not true because weak bases don't donate OH- directly.\n\nB: Not true because weak bases also have OH-.\n\nC: True, because strong bases dissociate completely, creating more ions, so they are good conductors. Weak bases don't, so they are not good conductors. So the statement \"only strong bases are good conductors\" is true.\n\nD: False, because for weak bases, OH- concentration is less than the base concentration.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C. Wait, but wait a second. Are all strong bases good conductors? Yes, because they dissociate completely into ions. Weak bases are weak electrolytes, so they don't conduct as well. So C is correct. But let me check again.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\" So if a weak base is dissolved, does it conduct? Yes, but not as well. So the statement says \"only strong bases are good conductors,\" which would mean that weak bases are not good conductors. Which is true. So C is correct. But let me check if there's any exceptions. For example, some weak bases might have higher conductivity? No, because their degree of ionization is low. So C is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original question is which is true for all bases. So the answer is the one that applies to all bases. Wait, but the options are about what is true for all bases. So the answer is the statement that is true for all bases. For example, if A is not true for all bases, since weak bases don't donate OH- directly. B is false. C is about conductors. For all bases, does \"Only strong bases are good conductors\" hold? Well, the statement isn't saying that all bases are good conductors. It's saying that only strong bases are. Which is true, because weak bases aren't. So the statement is true for all bases in the sense that if you have a base that is a good conductor, it must be a strong base. So C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the answer is different. Let me think again. Another approach: the question is asking which of the options is true for all bases. So the correct answer must be a statement that is always true for any base, whether strong or weak.\n\nOption C: Only strong bases are good conductors. This is a statement about all bases. It says that for all bases, if they are dissolved, only strong ones are good conductors. Which is true because weak bases don't dissociate much, so their solutions have fewer ions and are poor conductors. So this statement is true for all bases. So C is correct.\n\nBut wait, the wording is tricky. The statement is \"Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\" So does that mean that all good conductors are strong bases? Yes. Because if a base is a good conductor, it must be strong. But the statement is phrased as \"Only strong...\" which is equivalent to saying that strong bases are the only ones that are good conductors. Which is correct. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nSo the answer is C.\n</think>"}
