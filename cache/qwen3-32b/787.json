Let me start by recalling what the Pauli matrices are and their properties.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are 2x2 complex matrices that are fundamental in describing spin-1/2 particles. They are:\n\nσ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nσ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nσ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nEach of these matrices has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Also, the dot product σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.\n\nNow, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Since σ · n is a combination of Pauli matrices with components along the unit vector n, I need to find the eigenvalues of this operator multiplied by ε.\n\nI remember that for any unit vector n, the matrix σ · n is Hermitian and has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Let me verify this. For example, if n is along the z-axis, then σ · n is σ_z, which indeed has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Similarly, for any direction n, since the Pauli matrices all square to the identity matrix and anticommute, the eigenvalues should still be ±1. \n\nWait, more formally, the eigenvalues of σ · n can be found by noting that (σ · n)^2 = I. Let me check that. \n\nCalculating (σ · n)^2:\n\n(σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2\n\nExpanding this, we get terms like n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. Now, using the identity that σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_{ijk} σ_k. Therefore, when we square σ · n:\n\n= n_i n_j (δ_ij I + i ε_{ijk} σ_k)\n\nSumming over i and j. The cross terms involve ε_{ijk} σ_k multiplied by n_i n_j. However, since ε_{ijk} is antisymmetric in i and j, and n_i n_j is symmetric, their product will be zero when summed over i and j. Therefore, only the δ_ij terms survive:\n\n= n_i n_j δ_ij I = (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I = |n|² I = 1 * I, since n is a unit vector.\n\nTherefore, (σ · n)^2 = I, the identity matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n must satisfy λ² = 1, so λ = ±1. Therefore, σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. \n\nTherefore, H = ε σ · n would have eigenvalues ε * (+1) and ε * (-1), so +ε and -ε. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is +ε, -ε. Let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A is ± εħ/2. Wait, but the Pauli matrices themselves have factors that when multiplied by ħ/2 give the spin matrices. However, in the problem statement, σ is just the Pauli matrices, not the spin operators. The spin operators for spin-1/2 are usually written as S = ħ/2 σ. Therefore, if the Hamiltonian was written in terms of S · n, then the eigenvalues would be ± ħ ε /2. But here, the Hamiltonian is ε σ · n. Therefore, since σ has eigenvalues ±1, multiplying by ε would give ± ε. \n\nBut let me check if there is any missing factor of ħ/2 here. The problem says that ε is a constant with dimension of energy. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless. Therefore, σ · n is dimensionless, multiplied by ε (energy) gives H with energy dimension, which is correct. However, if the spin operator S = ħ/2 σ, then H would be ε σ · n = (2 ε / ħ) S · n. But since the question uses σ, not S, we don't need to include ħ. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are ± ε. So option C is correct. \n\nOption D is ± ħ/2, which would be the eigenvalues of S (spin operator), but here the Hamiltonian is written in terms of σ, so that's not the case. \n\nOption B is ±1, which would be eigenvalues of σ · n, but multiplied by ε here. So H's eigenvalues are ε times that. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
