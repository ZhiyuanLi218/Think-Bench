The options are given in different time units: per year, per minute, per millisecond, and per microsecond. Let me start by recalling what cosmic rays are. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, mostly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. They constantly bombard the Earth's atmosphere. But the question is about their flux at the Earth's surface. \n\nFirst, I should remember if there's any standard value or order of magnitude for cosmic ray flux that I've come across before. I think cosmic rays are pretty abundant, but they are mostly absorbed by the atmosphere. However, some secondary particles from their interactions in the atmosphere reach the surface. So maybe the flux is still significant? \n\nI remember that detectors like Geiger counters can detect cosmic rays. If I think about how often a Geiger counter clicks when not near any radioactive source, it's clicking because of cosmic rays. The rate is maybe a few clicks per minute? But a Geiger counter has a certain detection area and solid angle. Wait, the flux here is given per cm² per steradian. So maybe I need to think about the number of particles per unit area, per unit time, per steradian. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think. The flux is usually defined as the number of particles passing through a unit area per unit time. The units here are per cm², per steradian. So maybe they are considering the differential flux, which is the number of particles per unit area, per unit time, per steradian, per unit energy? But the question doesn't mention energy, so maybe it's integrated over all energies? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simplified, and they just want the approximate flux in terms of time. Let me try to find some numbers. \n\nI recall that the cosmic ray flux at sea level is on the order of tens of particles per square meter per second. Let me check that. For example, I think that at sea level, the flux is about 1 particle per cm² per hour. Wait, if it's per cm², that would be 1/(cm²·s·sr)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me convert the units. \n\nIf someone says 1 particle per cm² per hour, converting hours to seconds, that's 1/(cm²·hr) = 1/(3600 s·cm²). So that would be roughly 3×10⁻⁴ per cm² per second. But the options are in terms of per year, per minute, per millisecond, per microsecond. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the flux as, say, 100 particles per m² per second. Since 1 m² is 10^4 cm², so that would be 100/(10^4 cm²·s) = 0.01 per cm² per second. So 0.01 / (cm²·s). If we invert that, how many seconds between one particle per cm²? 1/0.01 = 100 seconds. So approximately one particle per cm² every 100 seconds. 100 seconds is about 1.6 minutes. So that would be roughly 1 per minute per cm². But the options also have per steradian. \n\nWait, so the units in the options are per year·cm⁻²·sr⁻¹, etc. So if the flux is 1 per minute per cm² per steradian, then option B is correct. But I need to think about the solid angle. \n\nWhat does \"per steradian\" mean here? In flux measurements, sometimes it's differential in angle. But if the particles are coming from all directions, or if we are considering the flux in a particular direction? For example, if you have a detector, it has a certain area and it detects particles coming into a certain solid angle. But if the cosmic rays are isotropic, then the flux per steradian would depend on how you define it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a standard flux definition where the flux is given as particles per unit area, per unit time, per steradian. If the total flux is, say, 1 per cm² per minute, and if the solid angle is 4π steradians, then the flux per steradian would be that total flux divided by 4π. But if the question is asking for the flux in a particular direction, or integrated over all directions?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to find a better approach. Let me recall some actual numbers. From what I remember, the flux of cosmic rays at the Earth's surface is roughly about 1 particle per cm² per hour. Let me check the units again. If it's 1 per cm² per hour, then converting to per second, that's 1/(3600 s) ≈ 2.78×10⁻⁴ per cm² per second. If the question is in terms of how often a particle arrives per cm², then 1 per hour is roughly 1/(3600 s). But the options are in terms of per year, per minute, etc. Let me convert 1 per hour into per minute: 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1/(60 min) ≈ 0.0167 per minute. Wait, but the options are like 1 per [time], so if it's 1 per hour, then the answer would be closer to option B (per minute) if the actual flux is higher than 1 per hour. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering the flux. Let me think again. If a Geiger counter clicks a few times per minute, and assuming that each click corresponds to a cosmic ray (though some might be from other sources), let's say 10 clicks per minute. Let's say the Geiger counter has a detection area. Suppose the window of the Geiger counter is, for example, 1 cm². If the detector has a certain efficiency, but let's assume 100% efficiency for simplicity. If it clicks 10 times per minute, then that would be 10 per minute per cm². If the solid angle is... Well, the detector is facing upwards, so maybe it's detecting particles coming from a certain direction. But if the question is about flux per steradian, then perhaps the total flux is integrated over all directions? \n\nAlternatively, if the flux is given per steradian, then if the particles are coming isotropically, the total flux would be integrated over 4π steradians. Suppose the flux is Φ per cm² per second per steradian. Then the total flux would be Φ × 4π per cm² per second. \n\nBut without knowing the exact definition, it's tricky. However, given that the options are orders of magnitude apart, maybe we can estimate. \n\nLet me look for approximate numbers. From what I recall, the cosmic ray flux at sea level is approximately about 1 particle per cm² per hour. Let me check this with some references. Wait, I can't actually look things up, but I can try to recall. \n\nIn some sources I remember, the flux of cosmic rays at sea level is about 10^4 particles per m² per second. Let me convert that. 1 m² is 10^4 cm², so 10^4 / (10^4 cm²·s) = 1 per cm² per second. So that would be 1 per cm² per second. If that is the case, then the flux is 1 per second per cm². But the options are per year, minute, ms, μs. So 1 per second would be equivalent to 1/(second·cm²·sr⁻¹)? Wait, but if the answer is 1 per second, then converting to the options, the closest would be option C or D? Wait no, the options are given as 1/[time]·cm⁻²·sr⁻¹. So if the flux is Φ = 1 / (cm²·s·sr), then that would correspond to option C or D depending on the time. But if Φ is 1 per cm² per second per steradian, then that would be 1 / (s·cm²·sr). However, if the flux is 1 per cm² per second, and if it's integrated over all solid angles, then per steradian would be that divided by 4π. \n\nBut I'm getting confused again. Let me think differently. Let me suppose that the flux is approximately 1 particle per cm² per minute. Then, in terms of the options, that would be 1 / (min·cm²·sr⁻¹), which is option B. If the flux is higher, like 1 per second, then it would be option C (per millisecond) because 1 per second is 1000 per second, so 1 per millisecond. But that seems high. \n\nAlternatively, if the flux is about 1 per minute, then option B. Let me try to think of another way. Suppose I have a detector of area A, and I measure the rate of cosmic rays. Let's say a typical detector might have an area of, say, 100 cm² (like 10 cm x 10 cm). If the flux is Φ per cm² per second, then the total rate would be Φ × A. \n\nSuppose I have a detector with area A and it detects cosmic rays at a rate R. Then Φ = R / A. \n\nIf I think of a typical cosmic ray detector rate. For example, a scintillator or a cloud chamber might detect maybe 1 event per second. If the area is, say, 100 cm², then Φ = 1 / (100 cm²·s) = 0.01 per cm² per second. Which is 0.01 / (cm²·s). To get how many seconds between one particle per cm², it would be 1 / 0.01 = 100 seconds, so roughly 1.6 minutes. So that would be about 1 per 1.6 minutes per cm². Which is close to option B (per minute). If the flux is approximately 1 per minute, then option B is correct. \n\nBut again, the question is about per steradian. If the flux is given per steradian, and assuming that the particles are coming from all directions, then maybe the flux per steradian is lower. For example, if the total flux is 1 per cm² per minute, and it's spread over 4π steradians, then the flux per steradian would be 1/(4π) per cm² per minute. But 4π is about 12.6, so roughly 0.08 per cm² per minute per steradian. But the options are about 1 per [time], so maybe the question is considering the total flux integrated over all solid angles? Or maybe the flux in a specific direction? \n\nAlternatively, if the flux is already integrated over all solid angles, then the per steradian part might not affect it. But usually, flux is given as per unit area per unit time, without considering solid angle. However, in astrophysics, sometimes flux is given as per steradian, especially when considering directional dependence. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Let me think again about approximate numbers. If I recall, the flux of cosmic rays at sea level is about 1 particle per cm² per hour. Let me convert that. 1 per hour is 1/(3600 s) ≈ 2.78×10⁻⁴ per second. If that's the case, then how does that compare to the options? \n\nOption B is per minute. If the flux is 2.78×10⁻⁴ per second, then per minute it's 2.78×10⁻⁴ × 60 ≈ 0.0167 per minute. So that would be roughly 0.0167 per minute, which is about 1 every 60 minutes / 0.0167 ≈ 60 / 0.0167 ≈ 3600 minutes, which is 2.5 days. That seems too low. But if I thought the flux was 1 per hour, then per minute it would be 1/60 ≈ 0.0167 per minute, which is what I just calculated. But that would mean that the flux is much lower than option B. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought about the detector with area 100 cm² detecting 1 per second, that implied a flux of 0.01 per cm² per second, which is 0.6 per cm² per minute. So that would be closer to option B, which is 1 per minute. So maybe the actual flux is around that. \n\nBut why the discrepancy? Maybe because the flux I recalled as 1 per hour is incorrect. Let me try to think of another approach. Let's consider the primary cosmic rays and the secondary particles. \n\nPrimary cosmic rays interact in the atmosphere, producing showers of secondary particles, including muons, which reach the Earth's surface. The flux of muons at the surface is a significant component of cosmic rays. \n\nI remember that the muon flux at sea level is about 1 per cm² per minute. Let me check. If I recall, the muon flux is approximately 100 particles per m² per second. Converting to cm²: 100 / (10^4 cm²) = 0.01 per cm² per second. Which is 0.01 × 60 = 0.6 per cm² per minute. So approximately 1 per cm² per minute. That matches with option B. \n\nTherefore, if the muon flux is about 1 per cm² per minute, and since muons are a major component of cosmic rays at the surface, then the total cosmic ray flux (which includes other particles like protons, electrons, etc.) would be roughly similar or slightly higher. Therefore, option B, which is 1 per minute per cm² per steradian, seems plausible. \n\nBut again, the steradians part. If the muon flux is isotropic, then the flux per steradian would depend on integrating over the solid angle. However, if the question is considering the flux in a particular direction (like the vertical direction), or if it's integrated over all directions, it's unclear. However, given that the options don't have a 1/(hour·cm²·sr⁻¹), and the closest is option B, which is per minute, and our calculation suggests about 1 per minute, then option B is likely correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the flux is given per steradian, and assuming that the total flux is integrated over 4π steradians, then the flux per steradian would be the total flux divided by 4π. For example, if total flux is 1 per minute per cm², then per steradian it would be 1/(4π) per minute per cm² per sr. Which is roughly 0.08 per minute per cm² per sr. But the options are 1 per [time], so this would suggest that the answer is lower than option B. However, since the options don't have such a value, maybe the question assumes that the flux is already per steradian? Or perhaps the question is using a different convention. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the flux in a specific direction, say, the vertical direction. If the flux is isotropic, then the flux in a specific direction would be the total flux divided by 2 (for a flat surface considering all angles above the surface). But this is getting too complicated. \n\nGiven that the muon flux is about 1 per cm² per minute, and considering that the question is likely looking for an approximate value, and given that option B is per minute, I think option B is the correct answer. \n\nAnother way to think: if you have a 1 m² detector, which is 10^4 cm², and the flux is 1 / (min·cm²), then the total number of particles per minute would be 1 / min·cm² × 10^4 cm² = 10^4 per minute, which is about 167 per second. This seems reasonable for a cosmic ray detector. For example, large detectors like those used in cosmic ray experiments have high rates, but for a 1 m² area, 167 per second is plausible. \n\nAlternatively, if the flux were 1 per second per cm² (option C), then for 1 m², that would be 10^4 per second, which is 10 kHz. That seems too high. I think the muon flux is lower than that. \n\nTherefore, considering all this, I think the correct answer is option B: $1 / \\text{min} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
