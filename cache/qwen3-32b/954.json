Hmm, this looks like a partial fractions problem. Let me recall how partial fractions work. If I have a rational expression, I can decompose it into simpler fractions, which in this case are already given as C/(x - 3) and D/(x + 8). \n\nFirst, let me check the denominator on the right-hand side. The denominator is x² + 5x - 24. Let me factor that to make sure it's factored into (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me multiply (x - 3)(x + 8):\n\n(x - 3)(x + 8) = x² + 8x - 3x - 24 = x² + 5x - 24. Yes, that's correct. So the denominator factors into (x - 3)(x + 8), which matches the denominators on the left-hand side. So, that means we can use partial fractions here.\n\nThe equation is already set up as the sum of two fractions equal to another fraction. The standard method is to combine the left-hand side over a common denominator and then equate the numerators.\n\nSo let me combine the left-hand side:\n\n$$\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n$$\n\nSince the denominators are equal on both sides, the numerators must be equal for the fractions to be equal. Therefore:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nSo, expanding the left-hand side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = (C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nSince this equation must hold for all x (except where the original equation is undefined), the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal. Therefore, we can set up a system of equations by equating the coefficients:\n\nFor the x term:\nC + D = 4\n\nFor the constant term:\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1) C + D = 4\n\n2) 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I need to solve this system for C and D. Let me do that.\n\nFrom equation 1), I can express C in terms of D or vice versa. Let me solve for C:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nThen substitute this into equation 2):\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nCompute 8*(4 - D):\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32 = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo D = 5. Then from equation 1):\n\nC + 5 = 4 => C = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nTherefore, C = -1 and D = 5. The problem asks for the product CD, so CD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify by plugging back into the original equation.\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side with C = -1 and D = 5:\n\nLeft-hand side:\n\n$$\n\\frac{-1}{x - 3} + \\frac{5}{x + 8}\n$$\n\nLet me combine these:\n\nCommon denominator is (x - 3)(x + 8):\n\nNumerator: -1*(x + 8) + 5*(x - 3) = -x - 8 + 5x - 15 = ( -x + 5x ) + ( -8 - 15 ) = 4x - 23\n\nWhich is exactly the numerator on the right-hand side. So yes, that checks out. Therefore, my values for C and D are correct.\n\nTherefore, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5. So the answer should be -5.\n\nBut let me just check my algebra again when solving the system. Let me go through solving the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nExpress C as 4 - D:\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = 32 - 8D - 3D = 32 - 11D = -23\n\nSo 32 - 11D = -23 => -11D = -23 - 32 => -11D = -55 => D = 5. Correct. Then C = 4 - 5 = -1. Correct. So that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve using elimination. Let me try that method as well to confirm.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3:\n\n3C + 3D = 12\n\nThen add to equation 2:\n\nEquation 2 is 8C - 3D = -23\n\nAdding 3C + 3D + 8C - 3D = 12 + (-23)\n\nWhich gives 11C = -11 => C = -1. Then D = 4 - C = 4 - (-1) = 5. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, CD = -1 * 5 = -5. So the answer is -5. I think that's solid. Let me check once again if I misread the problem.\n\nThe problem says \"Find the product CD of the integers C and D...\" and the equation is given for all real values except -8 and 3, which are the excluded values because they make denominators zero. Since we verified that with C=-1 and D=5, the decomposition works, so the product is indeed -5. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-5}\n</think>"}
