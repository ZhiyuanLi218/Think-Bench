Let me start by recalling what I know about the double-slit experiment. I remember that when light passes through two slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen. The pattern consists of bright and dark fringes, right? The bright fringes are where the light waves constructively interfere, and the dark ones are where they destructively interfere.\n\nThe question gives me the wavelength of the light, which is 589 nm. That's from a sodium lamp, which I think is the famous yellow sodium doublet, but maybe that's not important here. The screen is 1.00 meter away from the double slit. The center spacing between two adjacent bright fringes is 0.350 cm. I need to find the spacing of the double slits, which is usually denoted as 'd' in the formula.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the double-slit interference. The position of the bright fringes (constructive interference) is given by the equation:\n\nd * sinθ = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the slit spacing, θ is the angle from the central maximum to the m-th order maximum, m is the order number (an integer), and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nBut in experiments, especially when the angle θ is small, we can use the small-angle approximation. That is, when θ is small, sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ (in radians). Since the distance between the slits and the screen (L) is much larger than the distance from the central maximum to the fringe (y), tanθ = y / L, so sinθ ≈ y / L.\n\nTherefore, the formula simplifies to:\n\nd * (y / L) = m * λ\n\nSolving for d gives:\n\nd = (m * λ * L) / y\n\nBut here, they mention the center spacing between two adjacent bright fringes. Adjacent bright fringes correspond to a change in m by 1. So the distance between the m-th and (m+1)-th fringe is Δy = y_{m+1} - y_m. Let's compute that.\n\nFrom the equation above, rearranged for y:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nSo for the (m+1)-th fringe:\n\ny_{m+1} = ((m + 1) * λ * L) / d\n\nSubtracting y_m:\n\nΔy = y_{m+1} - y_m = ((m + 1) * λ * L / d) - (m * λ * L / d) = (λ * L / d) * (m + 1 - m) = λ * L / d\n\nSo the spacing between adjacent bright fringes is Δy = λ * L / d. Therefore, solving for d:\n\nd = (λ * L) / Δy\n\nOkay, so that's the formula I need. Let me check if I remember that correctly. Yes, the fringe spacing Δy is given by λL/d. So if I can plug in the numbers, I can find d.\n\nGiven:\n\nλ = 589 nm. Let me convert that to meters. 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 589 nm = 589e-9 m = 5.89e-7 m.\n\nL = 1.00 m.\n\nΔy is given as 0.350 cm. Wait, centimeters. Need to convert that to meters. 0.350 cm = 0.350 / 100 m = 0.00350 m = 3.50e-3 m.\n\nSo plugging into the formula:\n\nd = (λ * L) / Δy = (5.89e-7 m * 1.00 m) / 3.50e-3 m\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst multiply 5.89e-7 by 1.00: that's still 5.89e-7 m²? Wait, no, units: λ is in meters, L is in meters, so numerator is meters * meters? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, λ is in meters, L is in meters. The denominator Δy is in meters. So units:\n\n( (m) * (m) ) / m = m. Which is correct for d, which is a length. Okay.\n\nSo compute 5.89e-7 * 1.00 / 3.50e-3.\n\nLet me compute 5.89e-7 divided by 3.50e-3 first.\n\nDividing 5.89e-7 by 3.50e-3 is equal to (5.89 / 3.50) * 10^(-7 + 3) = (approx 1.682857...) * 10^-4.\n\nLet me do the exact division:\n\n5.89 divided by 3.50. Let me calculate that. 3.50 goes into 5.89 once (3.50), subtract, 2.39. Bring down a zero: 23.9 divided by 3.5. 3.5*6=21, so 6. 3.5*6.8= 23.8. So 6.8. So approximately 1.68.\n\nSo 1.68 * 10^-4 meters. So that would be 1.68e-4 m. Looking at the options, option C is 1.68 × 10^−4 m. So that would be option C.\n\nWait, let me check my calculation again. Let me compute 5.89 / 3.50 more accurately.\n\n3.5 times 1.68 is 3.5 * 1.68. Let's compute that:\n\n3.5 * 1.68 = 3.5 * 1 + 3.5 * 0.68 = 3.5 + 2.38 = 5.88. Oh! So 3.5 * 1.68 = 5.88, which is very close to 5.89. So 5.89 / 3.5 is approximately 1.68 + (5.89 - 5.88)/3.5 = 1.68 + 0.01 / 3.5 ≈ 1.68 + 0.002857 ≈ 1.682857. So approximately 1.682857 × 10^-4 m. So 1.68 × 10^-4 m when rounded to three significant figures.\n\nBut let me check the significant figures in the given data. The wavelength is given as 589 nm. That's three significant figures. The distance to the screen is 1.00 m, which is three significant figures. The fringe spacing is 0.350 cm, which is three significant figures as well (the leading zero is not significant, the decimal is there, so 0.350 has three: 3, 5, 0). Therefore, our answer should have three significant figures. Our calculation gives approximately 1.68 × 10^-4 m, which is option C.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) 2.06 × 10^-7 m\n\n(B) 2.06 × 10^-4 m\n\n(C) 1.68 × 10^-4 m\n\n(D) 1.68 × 10^-3 m\n\nYes, option C is correct. But just to make sure I didn't mix up any formulas.\n\nWait, let me check once again the formula. The fringe spacing Δy is λL/d. So solving for d: d = λL / Δy. Let me plug in numbers again:\n\nλ = 589 nm = 589 × 10^-9 m = 5.89 × 10^-7 m.\n\nL = 1.00 m.\n\nΔy = 0.350 cm = 0.00350 m.\n\nTherefore:\n\nd = (5.89 × 10^-7 m * 1.00 m) / 0.00350 m = (5.89 × 10^-7) / 0.00350 m.\n\nCalculating 5.89 × 10^-7 / 0.00350:\n\nFirst, 0.00350 is 3.5 × 10^-3.\n\nSo 5.89 × 10^-7 / 3.5 × 10^-3 = (5.89 / 3.5) × 10^(-7 + 3) = (approx 1.6828) × 10^-4, which is 1.68 × 10^-4 m. Yep, that's option C.\n\nSo why is option B 2.06 × 10^-4? Maybe if someone messed up the exponent? For example, if they forgot to convert cm to m? Let me check that. Suppose someone thought Δy was 0.350 m instead of 0.350 cm. Then Δy would be 0.35 m. Then d would be 5.89e-7 * 1.00 / 0.35 ≈ 1.68e-6 m, which is 1.68 × 10^-6 m, which is not any of the options. Alternatively, if someone used 0.350 mm instead of cm? Let's see. 0.350 mm is 0.00035 m = 3.5 × 10^-4 m. Then d would be 5.89e-7 / 3.5e-4 = approx 1.68e-3 m, which is option D. But no, the given Δy is 0.350 cm, so that's 0.0035 m.\n\nAlternatively, if someone confused the formula with d = Δy * d / λL? No, that seems not. Alternatively, if they thought Δy = d / λL or something. But no, I think the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal Δy is 0.350 cm. Convert cm to meters: 1 cm = 0.01 m. So 0.350 cm × (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.350 / 100 m = 0.0035 m. Yes, that's 3.5 × 10^-3 m. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation is correct, leading to option C. Therefore, the answer should be option C.\n\nBut let me check once again with precise numbers.\n\nLet me calculate 5.89 divided by 3.50 exactly. Let's do decimal division.\n\n5.89 ÷ 3.5.\n\nFirst, 3.5 goes into 5.8 once (1), 1 × 3.5 = 3.5. Subtract: 5.8 - 3.5 = 2.3. Bring down the 9: 23.9.\n\nNow, 3.5 goes into 23.9 how many times? 3.5 × 6 = 21.0, 3.5 × 6.8 = 23.8. So 6.8 times. So total is 1.68. Then the remainder is 23.9 - 23.8 = 0.1. Bring down a zero: 1.0. 3.5 goes into 1.0 0.2857 times... So total is approximately 1.6828... So 1.68 × 10^-4 m. So yes, 1.68 × 10^-4 m is option C. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
