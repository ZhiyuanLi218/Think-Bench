The question is about a nuclear reaction involving Beryllium-7 capturing a K-shell electron and emitting a neutrino. The problem is asking which of the four options (A to D) are correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens in electron capture. In electron capture, a proton in the nucleus captures an electron (usually from the K-shell) and converts into a neutron, emitting a neutrino. The general equation for electron capture is:\n\np + e⁻ → n + νₑ\n\nSo, the parent nucleus has a proton converted into a neutron, which means the atomic number (Z) decreases by 1, but the mass number (A) remains the same because a proton becomes a neutron. \n\nThe given reaction is:\n\n⁷₄Be + ⁰₋₁e → X + ⁰₀νₑ\n\nSo, Beryllium-7 (which has atomic number 4) captures an electron. Let's figure out what X is. \n\nSince Be has 4 protons and captures an electron, one of its protons will turn into a neutron. Therefore, the new nucleus X will have 4 - 1 = 3 protons. The element with atomic number 3 is Lithium (Li). The mass number should remain the same because the mass number is the number of protons plus neutrons. Since a proton is converted into a neutron, the total number of nucleons (mass number) stays at 7. So, X should be ⁷₃Li. That would make option A correct: X is ⁷Li. \n\nOption B says the total number of protons remains unchanged. But in this reaction, the number of protons decreases by 1 (from 4 to 3). So B is incorrect. \n\nOption C states the total mass number is different before and after. However, the mass number before is 7 (from Be) plus 0 (from the electron) = 7. After the reaction, X has mass number 7, and the neutrino has 0. So the total mass number remains 7. Therefore, C is incorrect. \n\nOption D claims the charge of the neutrino is the same as an electron. Electrons have a charge of -1. Neutrinos are electrically neutral, so their charge is 0. Therefore, D is incorrect. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option A. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal reaction: ⁷Be (Z=4) plus an electron (charge -1). After reaction, X must have Z=3 (Li), and neutrino is neutral. So yes, A is correct. B is wrong because protons decrease. C is wrong because mass number same. D is wrong because neutrino has no charge. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n</think>"}
