Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation given is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial. The problem is asking about when this equation has at least one real root. Since it's a quartic, it can have 0, 2, or 4 real roots (counting multiplicities), right? But we need to find the region in the a-b plane where there's at least one real root. So, maybe I need to find the conditions on a and b such that this equation has real roots.\n\nLet me write down the equation again:\n\nx⁴ + a x³ - b x² + a x + 1 = 0.\n\nHmm, quartic equations can be tricky. Maybe I can try to factor it or find some substitution. Let me check if there's any symmetry or pattern here. The coefficients are symmetric? Let me see:\n\nThe coefficients are 1 (for x⁴), a (for x³), -b (for x²), a (for x), and 1 (constant term). So, yes, the coefficients are symmetric. That suggests that this is a reciprocal polynomial. A reciprocal polynomial satisfies the condition that if you reverse the coefficients, you get the same polynomial. In this case, yes, because the coefficients are symmetric. For reciprocal polynomials, if r is a root, then 1/r is also a root. That might be useful.\n\nSo, for reciprocal polynomials, we can use substitution. Let me recall that for even degree reciprocal polynomials, we can use substitution y = x + 1/x. Let me try that here.\n\nFirst, let me divide both sides by x² to make it easier:\n\nx² + a x - b + a/x + 1/x² = 0.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx² + 1/x² + a(x + 1/x) - b = 0.\n\nNow, let me set y = x + 1/x. Then, note that x² + 1/x² = (x + 1/x)² - 2 = y² - 2.\n\nSo substituting that into the equation:\n\n(y² - 2) + a y - b = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ny² + a y - (b + 2) = 0.\n\nSo, the original quartic equation reduces to this quadratic in y: y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0.\n\nBut remember that y = x + 1/x. For real x ≠ 0, what are the possible values of y?\n\nWell, if x is real and non-zero, then y = x + 1/x. Let's consider real x. If x > 0, then by AM ≥ GM, x + 1/x ≥ 2. Similarly, if x < 0, let me set x = -t where t > 0. Then y = -t - 1/t = -(t + 1/t) ≤ -2. Therefore, y ∈ (-∞, -2] ∪ [2, ∞) when x is real and non-zero.\n\nTherefore, for the original quartic equation to have real roots, the quadratic equation in y must have at least one solution y such that |y| ≥ 2. So, the problem reduces to finding (a, b) such that the quadratic equation y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0 has at least one real solution y with |y| ≥ 2.\n\nSo, first, the quadratic equation in y must have real roots. The discriminant must be non-negative. Let me compute the discriminant:\n\nD = a² + 4(b + 2) ≥ 0. Since a and b are between 0 and 1, all terms here are non-negative. So D is always positive. Therefore, the quadratic equation always has two real roots. Therefore, the original quartic equation will have real roots if and only if at least one of the roots of the quadratic in y lies in (-∞, -2] ∪ [2, ∞).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: For (a, b) in [0, 1]x[0, 1], find when the quadratic equation y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0 has at least one root y with |y| ≥ 2.\n\nSo, how do I determine when a quadratic equation has a root in a certain interval? For quadratic equations, we can use the concept of roots lying in certain intervals. Let me recall that for a quadratic equation f(y) = y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0, the roots are given by:\n\ny = [-a ± sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2))]/2.\n\nWe need at least one of these roots to be ≤ -2 or ≥ 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the following approach: For the quadratic to have a root ≥ 2 or ≤ -2, we can use the following conditions:\n\nCase 1: There exists a root ≥ 2. For that, either:\n\n- The quadratic evaluated at y=2 is ≤ 0 (since the parabola opens upwards, if f(2) ≤ 0, then there is a root ≥ 2).\n\nOr,\n\n- The quadratic has a root ≥ 2 even if f(2) > 0. But since the parabola opens upwards, if the minimum of the quadratic is below zero, but maybe if the larger root is ≥ 2. However, since we already have two real roots, if the larger root is ≥ 2, then we can use the condition that the larger root is ≥ 2. Similarly for the smaller root ≤ -2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the following:\n\nFor quadratic equation f(y) = 0 to have at least one root ≥ 2, the following must hold:\n\nEither f(2) ≤ 0 or [the axis of symmetry is ≥ 2 and f(2) ≤ 0? Wait, maybe not. Let me recall the standard criteria.\n\nFor a quadratic equation f(y) = Ay² + By + C, with A > 0, the conditions for having a root ≥ k are:\n\nEither f(k) ≤ 0 or (the vertex is to the right of k and f(k) ≥ 0 and discriminant ≥ 0). Wait, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the roots, let me denote the roots as y₁ and y₂, with y₁ ≤ y₂ because the quadratic opens upwards. Then:\n\ny₁ ≤ y₂.\n\nWe want y₁ ≤ -2 or y₂ ≥ 2.\n\nSo, equivalently, the quadratic has a root in (-∞, -2] ∪ [2, ∞) if and only if y₁ ≤ -2 or y₂ ≥ 2.\n\nSo, how can we translate that into conditions on a and b?\n\nLet me recall that for quadratics:\n\ny₁ + y₂ = -a,\n\nand y₁ y₂ = - (b + 2).\n\nSo, sum of roots is -a, product is -(b + 2).\n\nGiven that, maybe we can use these relations to find conditions for y₁ ≤ -2 or y₂ ≥ 2.\n\nLet me first consider the case when y₂ ≥ 2. Since y₂ is the larger root, if y₂ ≥ 2, then we can use the following:\n\nThe larger root y₂ = [-a + sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2))]/2 ≥ 2.\n\nSimilarly, for the smaller root y₁ = [-a - sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2))]/2 ≤ -2.\n\nSo, let me handle these two cases separately.\n\nFirst, for y₂ ≥ 2:\n\n[-a + sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2))]/2 ≥ 2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n-a + sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) ≥ 4.\n\nThen, rearrange:\n\nsqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) ≥ 4 + a.\n\nSince sqrt(...) is non-negative, and 4 + a is positive (since a ≥ 0). Therefore, we can square both sides:\n\na² + 4(b + 2) ≥ (4 + a)².\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n(4 + a)² = 16 + 8a + a².\n\nTherefore:\n\na² + 4b + 8 ≥ 16 + 8a + a².\n\nSubtract a² from both sides:\n\n4b + 8 ≥ 16 + 8a.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4b ≥ 8 + 8a\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nb ≥ 2 + 2a.\n\nBut wait, our original constraints are 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1. However, b ≥ 2 + 2a would imply that b ≥ 2, since a ≥ 0. But since b ≤ 1, this inequality can never be satisfied. Therefore, there are no solutions for y₂ ≥ 2? That seems strange. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check. If we have sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) ≥ 4 + a. Let me check if squaring is valid here. Since both sides are positive? Let me see:\n\nsqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) is non-negative. 4 + a is positive because a ≥ 0. Therefore, squaring is allowed. Then, the result is 4b + 8 ≥ 16 + 8a, leading to 4b ≥ 8 + 8a, so b ≥ 2 + 2a. But since b ≤ 1, and 2 + 2a ≥ 2 > 1, there are no solutions. Therefore, there are no points (a, b) in our domain where y₂ ≥ 2. Therefore, the case y₂ ≥ 2 does not contribute anything. Therefore, the only possible case is y₁ ≤ -2.\n\nSo, let's check for y₁ ≤ -2.\n\nSimilarly, y₁ = [-a - sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2))]/2 ≤ -2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n-a - sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) ≤ -4.\n\nRearrange:\n\n- sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) ≤ -4 + a.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):\n\nsqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) ≥ 4 - a.\n\nNow, here, we have sqrt(...) ≥ 4 - a. Let me note that sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) is always non-negative. The right-hand side, 4 - a, since a ∈ [0,1], 4 - a ∈ [3,4], which is positive. Therefore, we can square both sides:\n\na² + 4(b + 2) ≥ (4 - a)².\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n(4 - a)² = 16 - 8a + a².\n\nTherefore:\n\na² + 4b + 8 ≥ 16 - 8a + a².\n\nSubtract a²:\n\n4b + 8 ≥ 16 - 8a.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4b ≥ 8 - 8a.\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nb ≥ 2 - 2a.\n\nSo, the condition for y₁ ≤ -2 is b ≥ 2 - 2a. However, we need to remember that this was derived under the assumption that sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) ≥ 4 - a. Since we squared both sides, we need to ensure that the original inequality holds. However, since both sides were positive, squaring is reversible here. Therefore, the condition is indeed b ≥ 2 - 2a.\n\nBut we also have the constraints 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1. Therefore, the set S is the set of (a, b) in [0,1]x[0,1] such that b ≥ 2 - 2a. However, we need to check for which a and b this inequality is possible.\n\nLet me analyze the inequality b ≥ 2 - 2a with 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1.\n\nFirst, note that 2 - 2a is a linear function in a. Let's find for which a ∈ [0,1], 2 - 2a ≤ 1 (since b cannot exceed 1). Let's solve 2 - 2a ≤ 1:\n\n2 - 2a ≤ 1 ⇒ -2a ≤ -1 ⇒ a ≥ 1/2.\n\nTherefore, when a ≥ 1/2, 2 - 2a ≤ 1. For a < 1/2, 2 - 2a > 1, which would mean that b ≥ something greater than 1, but since b ≤ 1, this is impossible. Therefore, the condition b ≥ 2 - 2a is only possible when a ≥ 1/2, and for those a, b must be ≥ 2 - 2a (but since b ≤ 1, the lower bound is max(2 - 2a, 0)), but since a ≥ 1/2, 2 - 2a ≤ 1, so it's just b ≥ 2 - 2a.\n\nTherefore, the set S is the region in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1] where a ≥ 1/2 and b ≥ 2 - 2a.\n\nTherefore, to compute the area of S, we need to integrate over a from 1/2 to 1, and for each a, b ranges from 2 - 2a up to 1.\n\nBut let me confirm this conclusion. Let me check if there are other cases where the quadratic equation has roots with |y| ≥ 2. Earlier, we considered only y₁ ≤ -2, and found that the condition is b ≥ 2 - 2a. However, we also need to make sure that there isn't another case where even though y₁ > -2 and y₂ < 2, but maybe one of the roots is exactly at -2 or 2? But since we already considered the case when y₁ ≤ -2, and the case y₂ ≥ 2 is impossible due to b needing to be ≥ 2 + 2a which is outside the domain. Therefore, the only contributing case is y₁ ≤ -2, leading to b ≥ 2 - 2a.\n\nTherefore, the area is the area under the line b = 2 - 2a from a = 1/2 to a = 1, within the unit square.\n\nLet me sketch this mentally. The line b = 2 - 2a can be rewritten as a = (2 - b)/2. When a = 1/2, b = 2 - 2*(1/2) = 2 - 1 = 1. When a = 1, b = 2 - 2*1 = 0. Therefore, the line connects the points (a, b) = (1/2, 1) to (1, 0). So, in the unit square, this is a straight line from the midpoint of the top edge (at a=1/2, b=1) down to the bottom right corner (a=1, b=0). The region S is above this line, from a=1/2 to a=1, and b from the line up to 1.\n\nTherefore, the area can be calculated as the integral from a=1/2 to a=1 of [1 - (2 - 2a)] da.\n\nCompute the integrand: 1 - (2 - 2a) = 1 - 2 + 2a = -1 + 2a.\n\nTherefore, the area is ∫ from 1/2 to 1 of (-1 + 2a) da.\n\nCompute the integral:\n\n∫(-1 + 2a) da = -a + a² + C.\n\nEvaluate from a=1/2 to a=1:\n\nAt a=1: -1 + (1)² = -1 + 1 = 0.\n\nAt a=1/2: - (1/2) + (1/2)² = -1/2 + 1/4 = -1/4.\n\nTherefore, the definite integral is 0 - (-1/4) = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the area of S is 1/4? Wait, but let me check again. Wait, the integral of (-1 + 2a) da from 1/2 to 1 is:\n\n[ -a + a² ] from 1/2 to 1.\n\nAt upper limit 1: -1 + 1² = -1 + 1 = 0.\n\nAt lower limit 1/2: - (1/2) + (1/2)^2 = -1/2 + 1/4 = -1/4.\n\nSubtracting lower limit from upper limit: 0 - (-1/4) = 1/4. Yes, so the area is 1/4. Therefore, the area of S is 1/4?\n\nBut wait, hold on. Is that the only region where the equation has real roots? Earlier, we concluded that only the region above the line b ≥ 2 - 2a for a ≥ 1/2. But maybe there are other regions?\n\nWait, for example, suppose a and b are such that the quadratic equation in y has both roots between -2 and 2. Then, the original quartic would have no real roots. However, if the quadratic equation in y has one root outside, then the quartic has real roots. Therefore, according to our previous analysis, the only region contributing is the one above the line b ≥ 2 - 2a for a ≥ 1/2. Therefore, the area is 1/4.\n\nBut let me test with specific values to see if that's correct. Let's take a=1, b=0. Then the equation becomes x⁴ + x³ - 0x² + x + 1 = x⁴ + x³ + x + 1 = 0. Let me check if this has real roots. Let me try x=-1: (-1)^4 + (-1)^3 + (-1) + 1 = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 0. Oh! So x=-1 is a root. Therefore, (a, b)=(1, 0) is in S, which is on the line we considered. So that's good.\n\nAnother test: take a=1/2, b=1. Then the equation is x⁴ + (1/2)x³ - 1x² + (1/2)x + 1 = 0. Let me check if it has real roots. Let me try x=-1: 1 - 1/2 - 1 - 1/2 + 1 = (1 - 1) + (-1/2 - 1/2) + ... Wait:\n\nx=-1: (-1)^4 + (1/2)(-1)^3 - 1*(-1)^2 + (1/2)(-1) + 1 = 1 - 1/2 - 1 - 1/2 + 1 = (1 - 1) + (-1/2 - 1/2) = 0 - 1 = -1 ≠ 0. Hmm, so x=-1 is not a root. Let me check if there is another real root. Maybe try x= -2? Let's compute:\n\nx=-2: 16 + (1/2)(-8) - 1*(4) + (1/2)(-2) + 1 = 16 - 4 - 4 - 1 + 1 = 16 - 4 - 4 -1 +1 = 8. Not zero. Maybe there's a real root somewhere else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the substitution again. Let me check for this case. When a=1/2, b=1, the quadratic in y is y² + (1/2)y - (1 + 2) = y² + (1/2)y - 3 = 0. The roots are y = [-1/2 ± sqrt(1/4 + 12)] / 2 = [-1/2 ± sqrt(49/4)] / 2 = [-1/2 ± 7/2]/2. Therefore:\n\nFirst root: (-1/2 + 7/2)/2 = (6/2)/2 = 3/2. Second root: (-1/2 -7/2)/2 = (-8/2)/2 = -2. So y=-2 is a root. Therefore, since y = -2, which corresponds to x + 1/x = -2. Let's solve x + 1/x = -2. Multiply by x: x² + 1 = -2x ⇒ x² + 2x + 1 = 0 ⇒ (x + 1)^2 = 0 ⇒ x = -1. Therefore, x=-1 is a double root. Therefore, the original equation has a real root (x=-1). Therefore, (a, b)=(1/2, 1) is indeed in S, which is on the boundary of our region.\n\nAnother test case: take a=3/4, b= something less than 2 - 2a. Let's compute 2 - 2*(3/4) = 2 - 3/2 = 1/2. So if we take b=0, which is less than 1/2. Then check if the equation has real roots. Let me compute the quadratic in y: y² + (3/4)y - (0 + 2) = y² + (3/4)y - 2 = 0. The roots are y = [-3/4 ± sqrt( (9/16) + 8 )]/2 = [-3/4 ± sqrt(137/16)]/2 = [-3/4 ± (√137)/4]/2 = [-3 ± √137]/8. Let me approximate √137 ≈ 11.7, so the roots are approximately (-3 + 11.7)/8 ≈ 8.7/8 ≈ 1.0875 and (-3 - 11.7)/8 ≈ -14.7/8 ≈ -1.8375. So the roots are approximately 1.0875 and -1.8375. The first root is less than 2, and the second root is greater than -2. Therefore, neither root is outside [-2, 2]. Therefore, the original quartic equation would not have real roots? Wait, but y = x + 1/x. If we have a solution y ≈ 1.0875, which is less than 2, then solving x + 1/x = 1.0875. Let me check if this equation has real solutions. For positive x, x + 1/x ≥ 2, so since 1.0875 < 2, there are no positive real solutions. For negative x, x + 1/x is ≤ -2. But 1.0875 is positive, so there are no solutions for this y. Similarly, for the other root y ≈ -1.8375. Since y = -1.8375 is greater than -2, so again, for negative x, x + 1/x ≤ -2. Since -1.8375 > -2, there are no real solutions for this y either. Therefore, the original quartic equation does not have real roots in this case. Therefore, (a, b) = (3/4, 0) is not in S, which is correct since b=0 < 2 - 2*(3/4)=0.5.\n\nTherefore, our region seems correct. Therefore, the area is 1/4. But wait, let me check another case where a < 1/2. For example, take a=0. Then the condition b ≥ 2 - 0 = 2 is impossible, as b ≤ 1. Therefore, for a=0, there are no b in [0,1] that satisfy the condition. Similarly, for a=1/4, 2 - 2*(1/4)= 2 - 0.5=1.5>1, so again no solutions. Therefore, only for a ≥ 1/2 do we have possible solutions, and the area is 1/4. Therefore, is the answer 1/4? Wait, but let me visualize the region again. The line from (1/2, 1) to (1, 0) divides the square. The area above the line in the square is a triangle? Wait, no. Wait, from a=1/2 to a=1, and for each a, b goes from 2 - 2a up to 1. Let me think of this as a region under the line b=2-2a from a=1/2 to a=1. Wait, but we are integrating 1 - (2 - 2a) da from 1/2 to 1, which is the area between the line and the top of the square. So this is a trapezoid or a triangle?\n\nWait, when a=1/2, 2 - 2a = 2 - 1 = 1, so the lower bound is 1, and upper bound is 1. Therefore, the region starts at (a=1/2, b=1) and goes down to (a=1, b=0). Therefore, this is a straight line from (1/2, 1) to (1, 0). The area above this line within the square is a triangle? Wait, if you connect (1/2, 1) to (1, 0) to (1, 1) and back to (1/2, 1). Wait, no. Actually, the region where b ≥ 2 - 2a for a ∈ [1/2, 1] is the area above the line from (1/2, 1) down to (1, 0). So in the square, this is a triangular region? Let me think. If you imagine the unit square, the line goes from the midpoint of the top side to the bottom right corner. The area above this line is a triangle with vertices at (1/2, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 0). Wait, no. Wait, if you go from (1/2, 1) to (1, 0), then the area above the line would be between the line, the top of the square, and the right side. So yes, it's a triangle with vertices at (1/2, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 0). Wait, but (1, 0) is not on the same line. Wait, the triangle would be formed by the points (1/2, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 0). The base is from (1, 1) to (1, 0), which is length 1. The height is from (1/2, 1) to (1, 1), which is 1/2. The area of a triangle is (base * height)/2 = (1 * 1/2)/2 = 1/4. Which matches our integral result. Therefore, the area is indeed 1/4. Therefore, the answer should be 1/4.\n\nBut let me check once more for another point. Let me take a=3/4, b=1/2. Since 2 - 2*(3/4)= 2 - 3/2=1/2, so b=1/2 is on the line. Therefore, (a, b)=(3/4, 1/2) is on the boundary. Let me check if the equation has a real root. The quadratic in y is y² + (3/4)y - (1/2 + 2) = y² + (3/4)y - 5/2 = 0. The roots are y = [-3/4 ± sqrt(9/16 + 10)] / 2 = [-3/4 ± sqrt(169/16)] / 2 = [-3/4 ± 13/4]/2. First root: (-3/4 + 13/4)/2 = (10/4)/2 = (5/2)/2 = 5/4. Second root: (-3/4 -13/4)/2 = (-16/4)/2 = -4/2 = -2. So y=-2 is a root. Therefore, solving x + 1/x = -2 gives x=-1 as before. Therefore, the equation has a real root. Therefore, (3/4, 1/2) is in S, which is on the boundary. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, it seems that our region is correct, and the area is indeed 1/4. Therefore, the answer is 1/4. But let me check once more if there's any other region where the equation has real roots.\n\nSuppose, for example, that the quadratic equation in y has both roots between -2 and 2. Then, the original equation would have no real roots. However, if the quadratic equation has exactly one root at y=-2 or y=2, but we already considered those cases. Also, if the quadratic equation has complex roots? Wait, no, we already established that discriminant is always positive, so quadratic has two real roots. Therefore, the only way the original equation has real roots is when at least one of the roots of the quadratic is ≤ -2 or ≥ 2, but we saw that the case ≥2 is impossible in our domain, so only ≤ -2, which gives us the line b ≥ 2 - 2a. Therefore, the area is indeed 1/4.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the quadratic equation. Suppose that both roots of the quadratic are between -2 and 2. Then, the original equation would have no real roots. So, the set S is the complement of that region in the unit square. Therefore, perhaps there's another way to compute the area? For example, if we can find the area where the quadratic has both roots in (-2, 2), then subtract that from 1. But maybe that's more complicated. But just to check consistency.\n\nAlternatively, since we have already found that the area is 1/4, and verified with examples, perhaps it's safe. However, let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have the quadratic equation y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0. For both roots to lie in (-2, 2), the following must hold:\n\n1. The quadratic has real roots (which it always does).\n\n2. Both roots are greater than -2 and less than 2.\n\nFor quadratics, the conditions for both roots lying in (k, m) can be given by:\n\n- The quadratic evaluated at k and m is positive (if leading coefficient is positive),\n\n- The discriminant is non-negative,\n\n- The axis of symmetry is between k and m,\n\n- The minimum value is below the maximum of the interval?\n\nWait, more systematically, for both roots to lie in (-2, 2), we need:\n\nf(-2) > 0,\n\nf(2) > 0,\n\nand the vertex is between -2 and 2,\n\nand the discriminant is non-negative.\n\nBut since discriminant is always positive, we can ignore that.\n\nGiven that the quadratic is f(y) = y² + a y - (b + 2). Since leading coefficient is positive (1), for both roots to lie in (-2, 2), we need:\n\nf(-2) > 0,\n\nf(2) > 0,\n\nand the vertex y = -a/2 ∈ (-2, 2).\n\nLet me compute f(-2):\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^2 + a*(-2) - (b + 2) = 4 - 2a - b - 2 = 2 - 2a - b > 0 ⇒ 2 - 2a - b > 0 ⇒ b < 2 - 2a.\n\nSimilarly, f(2) = (2)^2 + a*(2) - (b + 2) = 4 + 2a - b - 2 = 2 + 2a - b > 0 ⇒ 2 + 2a - b > 0 ⇒ b < 2 + 2a. Since a and b are between 0 and 1, 2 + 2a ≥ 2 > b, so this condition is always satisfied. Therefore, f(2) > 0 is always true. Therefore, the only condition from f(-2) and f(2) is f(-2) > 0 ⇒ b < 2 - 2a. Also, we need the vertex between -2 and 2. The vertex is at y = -a/2. Since a ∈ [0, 1], then y ∈ [-0.5, 0]. Therefore, the vertex is always between -0.5 and 0, which is within (-2, 2). Therefore, the only condition for both roots lying in (-2, 2) is b < 2 - 2a. Therefore, the region where the original equation has no real roots is when b < 2 - 2a. Therefore, the region S where the equation has at least one real root is the complement of that, i.e., b ≥ 2 - 2a, which is exactly what we found earlier. Therefore, the area of S is the area of the unit square minus the area where b < 2 - 2a. However, since the unit square has area 1, and the area where b < 2 - 2a is the area below the line from (1/2, 1) to (1, 0). But since we already calculated the area above the line as 1/4, then the area below the line would be 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. However, we need to check if the line b = 2 - 2a is entirely within the square. For a from 0 to 1/2, 2 - 2a goes from 2 down to 1. But since b cannot exceed 1, the region b < 2 - 2a for a ∈ [0, 1/2] is actually the entire square below b=1, since 2 - 2a ≥ 1 there. Therefore, the area below the line in the square is the area for a ∈ [0, 1/2] with b from 0 to 1, plus the area for a ∈ [1/2, 1] with b from 0 to 2 - 2a. Therefore, the total area below the line is:\n\nFor a from 0 to 1/2: width 1/2, height 1, area 1/2 * 1 = 1/2.\n\nFor a from 1/2 to 1: integral from 1/2 to 1 of (2 - 2a - 0) da = ∫(2 - 2a) da from 1/2 to 1.\n\nCompute integral:\n\n∫2 - 2a da = 2a - a² evaluated from 1/2 to 1.\n\nAt 1: 2*1 - 1² = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nAt 1/2: 2*(1/2) - (1/2)^2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the integral is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, total area below the line is 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4, so area above the line is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4. Therefore, confirming our previous result. Therefore, the area of S is indeed 1/4.\n\nTherefore, after thorough analysis and multiple checks, I conclude that the area of S is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\n</think>"}
