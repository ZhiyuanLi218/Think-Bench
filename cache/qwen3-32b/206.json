The reaction given is π⁻ p → (Λ⁰ or K⁰)(K⁰ or K̄⁰). Hmm, let me start by recalling what neutral K mesons are. There are two neutral K mesons: K⁰ and its antiparticle K̄⁰. These particles are their own antiparticles in some sense, but they are actually distinct particles. However, they can mix through weak interactions, forming the neutral K meson eigenstates, which are the short-lived (K₁⁰) and long-lived (K₂⁰) states. But the question is about producing a pure beam of either K⁰ or K̄⁰ without the other.\n\nNow, the reaction is π⁻ (pion) colliding with a proton (p) to produce either a Λ⁰ and a K⁰/K̄⁰ pair, or maybe some other combination? Wait, the reaction is written as producing either Λ⁰ or K⁰, and then another K⁰ or K̄⁰. Wait, maybe it's a two-body reaction? Let me parse the reaction again. The left side is π⁻ and p (proton), and the right side is either a Λ⁰ or a K⁰, and then another K⁰ or K̄⁰. So maybe it's a two-body reaction where the products are either Λ⁰ and K⁰, or Λ⁰ and K̄⁰, or K⁰ and K⁰, or K⁰ and K̄⁰? But the notation is a bit confusing. Wait, the way it's written is π⁻ p → (Λ⁰ or K⁰)(K⁰ or K̄⁰). So maybe it's two different reactions? Or perhaps it's a single reaction that can produce either Λ⁰ plus K⁰/K̄⁰ or K⁰ plus K⁰/K̄⁰? Hmm, perhaps I need to look at the possible reactions that produce neutral K mesons.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible reactions. When a pion (π⁻) collides with a proton (p), what kind of reactions can produce neutral K mesons? Let me recall some common reactions. For example, in hyperon production, a common reaction is π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰. That's a well-known reaction. Similarly, there might be a reaction π⁻ p → Σ⁰ K⁰, but Σ⁰ is not mentioned here. Also, there's the possibility of producing K⁰ and K̄⁰ pairs? Wait, but producing a K⁰ and K̄⁰ would require enough energy, but maybe in some reactions?\n\nBut the question is about which of these reactions can produce a pure K⁰ beam without K̄⁰. Since K⁰ and K̄⁰ can oscillate into each other, if they are produced as a coherent superposition, they will mix. However, if they are produced in a way that is CP eigenstate or something else, maybe they can be pure?\n\nWait, but the question is about the reaction itself producing a pure beam. So maybe depending on the reaction, the produced K⁰ is in a state that is not entangled with its antiparticle. Let me think about the quantum numbers. For example, in the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰, what is the CP of the initial and final states?\n\nFirst, let's recall that the pion π⁻ has a charge of -1, and is a pseudoscalar meson (spin 0, negative parity). The proton is a baryon with spin 1/2, positive parity. The Λ⁰ is a hyperon with spin 1/2, and the K⁰ is a pseudoscalar meson (spin 0, negative parity). \n\nIn strong interactions, which are responsible for producing particles in such reactions, the reaction must conserve various quantum numbers, including charge, baryon number, and (approximately) parity. Also, in strong interactions, CP is conserved (though there is the strong CP problem, but I think for the purposes of this question, we can assume CP is conserved in the strong interaction).\n\nSo let's consider the reaction π⁻ + p → Λ⁰ + K⁰. Let's check the quantum numbers. \n\nCharge: π⁻ has charge -1, proton has +1. Total initial charge is 0. Λ⁰ has charge 0, K⁰ has charge 0. So total final charge is 0. That's good.\n\nBaryon number: π⁻ has baryon number 0, proton has +1. Total initial baryon number is +1. Λ⁰ has +1, K⁰ has 0. So total final is +1. Good.\n\nNow, let's think about the CP. The initial state is π⁻ p. The π⁻ has CP of (-1)(-1) = +1? Wait, let me recall: for pions, π⁻ is a pseudoscalar meson, so its parity is negative. The charge conjugation of π⁻ is π⁺, so C(π⁻) = -π⁺. But since π⁻ is a pseudoscalar, its intrinsic parity is -1. For a pion, the CP is (+1)(-1) = -1? Wait, no. Wait, charge conjugation C acts on the pion by flipping its charge, so C|π⁻> = |π⁺>, so the charge conjugation eigenvalue for π⁻ is not straightforward unless it's neutral. For charged pions, they are not eigenstates of C. Similarly, the proton is a baryon, which has C=0 because it's a fermion. So the total CP of the initial state is not straightforward. Maybe I need to think about the overall CP of the reaction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in strong interactions, the produced particles must have the same CP as the initial state? Wait, but the initial state is π⁻ p, which is a hadronic system. However, the reaction is a strong interaction, so it should conserve CP. However, since the initial state is not a CP eigenstate, maybe the final state isn't either? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in certain reactions, the produced K⁰ is in a definite CP state, whereas in others, it's not. Wait, but K⁰ and K̄⁰ are not CP eigenstates. The CP eigenstates are (K⁰ ± K̄⁰)/√2, right? Wait, actually, if we consider the CP transformation, then for K⁰, which is a d s̄ quark, applying CP would give C P |K⁰> = C P |d s̄> = |s̄ d> = |K̄⁰>, so CP|K⁰> = |K̄⁰>. Therefore, if we have a state that is a superposition of K⁰ and K̄⁰, then under CP it would transform accordingly. But if a reaction produces a definite K⁰ or K̄⁰, then under CP it would transform into the other. However, since the strong interaction conserves CP, then if the initial state has a certain CP, the final state must have the same. Therefore, if the initial state has a certain CP, and the reaction is a strong interaction, then the final state must also have that CP. Therefore, if the final state is a superposition of K⁰ and K̄⁰, then that superposition must be a CP eigenstate. \n\nTherefore, if the reaction produces a K⁰, but because of CP conservation, it must produce a superposition of K⁰ and K̄⁰? Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the reaction is a strong interaction, so it must conserve CP. Therefore, the initial state has a certain CP, and the final state must have the same CP. So if the initial state has a certain CP, then the final state must also have that CP. Therefore, if the final state includes a K⁰, then the rest of the final state must combine with it such that the total CP is the same as the initial state. \n\nFor example, take the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰. Let's try to compute the CP of the initial and final states. \n\nFirst, initial state: π⁻ (which is ū d) and proton (uud). The π⁻ has negative intrinsic parity (P=-1). The proton has positive intrinsic parity (P=+1). So total parity of the initial state is P_initial = P_π * P_p * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between the π⁻ and p. But since we don't know the orbital angular momentum, maybe this approach is too vague. Alternatively, perhaps we can look at the overall CP of the reaction.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider that in the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰, the Λ⁰ and K⁰ are produced in a state that has the same CP as the initial state. Let me think about the CP of the final state. The Λ⁰ is a baryon with spin 1/2, and its CP? Well, baryons are fermions, so they have C=0 because they are not eigenstates of charge conjugation. Similarly, the K⁰ is a meson, so it has C and P. The K⁰ has P = -1 (pseudoscalar), and its charge conjugation? For a neutral K⁰, which is a d s̄, its charge conjugation eigenvalue is C = -1? Wait, charge conjugation acts on the meson by swapping the quark and antiquark. For a neutral meson like K⁰ (d s̄), applying C would give C|K⁰> = |K̄⁰>, so it's not an eigenstate of C. Therefore, the total CP of the final state would be... Hmm, since the Λ⁰ has C=0 (as it's a fermion), and the K⁰ has CP as discussed, perhaps the total CP of the final state is determined by the K⁰? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that in the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰, the Λ⁰ and K⁰ are produced in a way that their combined state has a definite CP. Since the initial state (π⁻ p) has a certain CP, and the reaction is a strong interaction (which conserves CP), the final state must have the same CP. If the final state includes a Λ⁰ (which is a fermion, so its C=0 and P=+1?), and a K⁰ (P=-1), then the total parity would be P_Λ * P_K * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between Λ⁰ and K⁰. But again, without knowing L, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Let me recall that in the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰, the produced K⁰ is in a definite state, not a superposition. Whereas in some other reactions, the K⁰ is produced in a superposition with K̄⁰. Wait, but how would that happen? \n\nWait, here's an idea. If the reaction produces a K⁰ and a baryon (like Λ⁰), then the K⁰ is produced in a definite state because the baryon is not its antiparticle. Whereas if the reaction produces two neutral mesons, like K⁰ and K̄⁰, then they might be produced in a CP eigenstate, which is a superposition of K⁰ and K̄⁰. For example, the reaction π⁻ p → K⁰ K̄⁰ would produce a state that is a CP eigenstate, hence a superposition of K⁰ and K̄⁰. Whereas the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ would produce a definite K⁰, because the Λ⁰ is a baryon and not its own antiparticle, so there's no mixing. \n\nTherefore, if the reaction produces a K⁰ along with a baryon (Λ⁰), then it's a pure K⁰ beam, whereas if it produces a K⁰ along with another meson (like K̄⁰), then it's a superposition. Therefore, the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ would produce a pure K⁰ beam without contamination from K̄⁰, whereas π⁻ p → K⁰ K̄⁰ would produce a beam that is a superposition of K⁰ and K̄⁰, hence not pure. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ can produce a pure neutral K beam, while the reaction π⁻ p → K⁰ K̄⁰ cannot. However, the question lists the reaction as π⁻ p → (Λ⁰ or K⁰)(K⁰ or K̄⁰), so it's a single reaction that can produce either Λ⁰ K⁰, Λ⁰ K̄⁰, K⁰ K⁰, or K⁰ K̄⁰? Or is it two separate reactions? The way it's written is a bit ambiguous. \n\nWait, the question says \"which of the following four reactions can produce a pure neutral K beam...\", but there's only one reaction given? Wait, the original problem might have had four different reactions, but in the user's input, only one is given. Wait, looking back at the user's question:\n\n\"(1) Explain which of the following four reactions can produce a pure neutral K beam, that is not contaminated by the presence of its antiparticle.\n\nπ⁻ p → (Λ⁰ or K⁰)(K⁰ or K̄⁰)\"\n\nHmm, maybe the user only provided one reaction here, but the actual problem had four different reactions, and the user only copied one? Or perhaps there was a formatting issue. Assuming that the user is referring to the reaction given, and maybe the four reactions are variations of this, but only one is provided here. Given the information available, I need to work with the given reaction.\n\nBut according to the given reaction, it's π⁻ p → (Λ⁰ or K⁰)(K⁰ or K̄⁰). So this is a reaction that can produce either Λ⁰ K⁰, Λ⁰ K̄⁰, K⁰ K⁰, or K⁰ K̄⁰. But the question is about which of these can produce a pure K beam. \n\nSo if the reaction produces Λ⁰ K⁰, then as discussed earlier, the K⁰ is produced in a pure state because it's paired with a baryon (Λ⁰) which doesn't have an antiparticle counterpart in the same reaction. Whereas if the reaction produces K⁰ K̄⁰, then the two mesons are produced in a CP eigenstate, which is a superposition of K⁰ and K̄⁰. Therefore, if you want to collect the K⁰ from the reaction, you would get a beam that is a superposition with its antiparticle, hence not pure. \n\nTherefore, the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ can produce a pure K beam, whereas π⁻ p → K⁰ K̄⁰ cannot. However, the given reaction is a combination of possibilities. If the reaction can produce both Λ⁰ K⁰ and K⁰ K̄⁰, then depending on which final state is produced, you get different beams. But the question is asking which of the four reactions (assuming there are four, but only this one is given) can produce a pure beam. Given only this reaction, the answer would depend on which of the possible final states is produced. \n\nBut perhaps the key is that in the reaction producing Λ⁰ K⁰, you can get a pure K⁰ beam, whereas in the reaction producing K⁰ K̄⁰, you get a beam that is a superposition. Therefore, if the reaction can produce Λ⁰ K⁰, then that is the one that can produce a pure beam. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ can produce a pure neutral K beam, while the other possible final states (Λ⁰ K̄⁰, K⁰ K⁰, K⁰ K̄⁰) cannot. However, since the question is about the given reaction, which includes the possibility of producing Λ⁰ K⁰, then this reaction can produce a pure beam if it goes into that channel. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"which of the following four reactions can produce...\", but only one reaction is written here. Assuming that in the original problem, there are four different reactions, each producing different combinations, and the user only provided one. But given the information, I have to work with this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is written as producing either Λ⁰ or K⁰ in one slot and K⁰ or K̄⁰ in the other, implying two different reactions: one producing Λ⁰ and (K⁰ or K̄⁰), and another producing K⁰ and (K⁰ or K̄⁰). If that's the case, then comparing these two possibilities:\n\n1. π⁻ p → Λ⁰ + (K⁰ or K̄⁰)\n2. π⁻ p → K⁰ + (K⁰ or K̄⁰)\n\nIn the first case, producing Λ⁰ and a K meson, since Λ⁰ is a baryon, the K meson is produced in a definite state (either K⁰ or K̄⁰), because the baryon doesn't mix with its antiparticle in the same reaction. Whereas in the second case, producing K⁰ and another K meson, if it's K⁰ K̄⁰, then they are produced in a CP eigenstate, hence a superposition, so you can't get a pure beam. If it's K⁰ K⁰, that would require some other mechanism, but K⁰ K⁰ would be a symmetric state, but since they are identical bosons, but they are neutral, so again, not sure. However, producing two K⁰s would not necessarily involve their antiparticles, so maybe that could be pure? But K⁰ and K̄⁰ are distinct particles. \n\nWait, if you produce two K⁰s, that would be a beam of K⁰s without any K̄⁰s, hence pure. But is that possible? For example, can you have a reaction π⁻ p → K⁰ K⁰? Let's check the quantum numbers. Charge: π⁻ (-1) + p (+1) = 0. K⁰ has charge 0, so two K⁰s would give total charge 0. Baryon number: π⁻ (0) + p (1) = 1. K⁰ has baryon number 0, so two K⁰s would give 0. Wait, that's a problem. Baryon number is not conserved. So π⁻ p → K⁰ K⁰ is not possible because baryon number is 1 on the left and 0 on the right. Therefore, that reaction is impossible. Therefore, the only possible reactions are π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ (or Λ⁰ K̄⁰) and π⁻ p → K⁰ K̄⁰ (since that would have baryon number 0 on both sides: initial is 1 (proton), but wait, π⁻ p → K⁰ K̄⁰ would have baryon number 0 on the right, but initial is 1. Wait, that's also a problem. Wait, hold on, baryon number: π⁻ has 0, proton has +1. On the right side, Λ⁰ has +1 baryon number, K⁰ has 0. So π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ is okay for baryon number (1=1+0). Whereas π⁻ p → K⁰ K̄⁰ would have baryon number 0 on the right, which doesn't match the initial 1. Therefore, that reaction is impossible. Similarly, π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K̄⁰ would have baryon number 1 (Λ⁰) + 0 (K̄⁰) = 1, which is okay. \n\nWait, so the possible reactions are π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ and π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K̄⁰. The other possibilities like K⁰ K⁰ or K⁰ K̄⁰ are either impossible due to baryon number or charge. \n\nTherefore, in the given reaction π⁻ p → (Λ⁰ or K⁰)(K⁰ or K̄⁰), the only possible reactions are π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ and π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K̄⁰. The others are forbidden by conservation laws. \n\nSo now, between these two, which one produces a pure K beam? If the reaction produces Λ⁰ K⁰, then you can collect the K⁰ and it's a pure beam. If it produces Λ⁰ K̄⁰, then you can collect the K̄⁰, which is also a pure beam. However, the question is about producing a pure neutral K beam, not specifying whether it's K⁰ or K̄⁰. So either reaction can produce a pure beam, depending on which antiparticle is produced. But the question is likely asking which reaction (among the four, presumably different ones) can produce a pure beam. Given that only the Λ⁰ K⁰ and Λ⁰ K̄⁰ reactions are possible, both can produce pure beams. \n\nBut maybe there's another consideration. For example, if the reaction produces Λ⁰ K⁰, the K⁰ is produced in a definite state, whereas if it produces Λ⁰ K̄⁰, the K̄⁰ is produced in a definite state. So depending on which one you collect, you get a pure beam. Therefore, the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ can produce a pure K⁰ beam, and π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K̄⁰ can produce a pure K̄⁰ beam. \n\nHowever, the question is phrased as \"which of the following four reactions can produce a pure neutral K beam...\". Assuming that among the four reactions, one is π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰, and others might be different, but given only this one, it can produce a pure beam. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ can produce a pure neutral K beam, while the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K̄⁰ can produce a pure neutral K̄ beam, but since the question is about K beam (not specifying K or K̄), both are acceptable. However, if the question is about which reaction (among possible ones) allows for a pure K beam, then the one producing Λ⁰ K⁰ is the one. \n\nAnother angle: in some reactions, the produced K⁰ is in a definite state because of the other particles in the reaction. For example, if you have a reaction that produces a Λ⁰ and a K⁰, since Λ⁰ is a baryon and not its own antiparticle, there's no way for the K⁰ to be mixed with K̄⁰ because that would require the Λ⁰ to be mixed with its antiparticle, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the K⁰ is produced in a pure state. Whereas if you have a reaction that produces two neutral mesons, like K⁰ and K̄⁰, then they are produced in a CP eigenstate, which is a superposition. However, as we saw earlier, producing two K mesons would violate baryon number, so that's not possible here. \n\nTherefore, the only possible reactions are the ones producing Λ⁰ and K⁰ or K̄⁰, and those can produce pure beams. Hence, the reaction π⁻ p → Λ⁰ K⁰ can produce a pure neutral K beam.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe reaction that can produce a pure neutral $ K $ beam is \\boxed{\\pi^{-} p \\rightarrow \\Lambda^{0} K^{0}}.\n</think>"}
