Atomic Radius Trend**\n\n- **Trend Across a Period:** Atomic radius **decreases** from left to right across a period due to increasing nuclear charge, which pulls electrons closer to the nucleus.\n- **Position in the Periodic Table:** Sodium (Na) is in **Group 1**, while magnesium (Mg) is in **Group 2**.\n- **Conclusion:** Since sodium is to the **left** of magnesium in the same period, it must have a **larger atomic radius** than magnesium.\n\nGiven that magnesium has an atomic radius of **160 pm**, sodium's atomic radius should be **greater than 160 pm**. Among the options, only **186 pm** satisfies this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ionization Energy Trend**\n\n- **Trend Across a Period:** First ionization energy **increases** from left to right due to the increasing effective nuclear charge, making it harder to remove an electron.\n- **Position in the Periodic Table:** Again, sodium is to the **left** of magnesium.\n- **Conclusion:** Sodium must have a **lower ionization energy** than magnesium.\n\nGiven that magnesium has a first ionization energy of **737 kJ/mol**, sodium's ionization energy should be **less than 737 kJ/mol**.

Final Evaluation of Options**\n\nLet’s examine the options:\n\n- **A: 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol** ✅ Matches both the atomic radius and ionization energy trends.\n- **B: 186 pm, 898 kJ/mol** ❌ Ionization energy is too high for sodium.\n- **C: 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol** ❌ Atomic radius is too small.\n- **D: 147 pm, 523 kJ/mol** ❌ Atomic radius is too small.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Correct Answer: A: 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium based on magnesium's data. Let me start by recalling what I know about the periodic trends for atomic radius and ionization energy.\n\nFirst, atomic radius. From what I remember, atomic radius generally decreases across a period from left to right and increases down a group. So, if magnesium and sodium are in the same period, which they are—both are in period 3—then sodium is to the left of magnesium. That means sodium should have a larger atomic radius than magnesium because as you go left across a period, the atomic radius increases. Wait, magnesium is in group 2, sodium is in group 1, so sodium is to the left of magnesium. So sodium's atomic radius should be larger than magnesium's. The given atomic radius for magnesium is 160 pm. So sodium's atomic radius should be larger than 160 pm. Looking at the options, option A is 186 pm, which is larger, so that's a possibility. The other options: B is 186 pm, same as A. C is 135 pm, which is smaller, so that's not right. D is 147 pm, also smaller. So based on atomic radius, the answer must be either A or B. \n\nNow, ionization energy. The first ionization energy generally increases across a period from left to right. So since sodium is to the left of magnesium, its ionization energy should be lower than magnesium's. Magnesium's first ionization energy is 737 kJ/mol. So sodium's should be less than that. Looking at the options, A is 496 kJ/mol, B is 898 kJ/mol. So B is higher, which would be incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer must be A: 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sodium is in group 1, period 3, and magnesium is group 2, period 3. So sodium is to the left. Atomic radius increases down a group and decreases across a period. So since sodium is to the left of magnesium in the same period, sodium has a larger atomic radius. Ionization energy increases across a period, so sodium has lower ionization energy than magnesium. So the answer should be A. Let me confirm with actual values. From memory, sodium's atomic radius is about 186 pm, and its first ionization energy is about 496 kJ/mol. Yes, that matches option A. So the answer is A.\n</think>"}
