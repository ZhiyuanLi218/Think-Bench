Gravity is the force that provides the necessary centripetal force to keep the Moon in its nearly circular path around the Earth. In the absence of this force, the Moon would no longer experience the pull that keeps it in orbit. Instead, it would continue moving in a straight line at a constant velocity, tangent to the point in its orbit where the force was removed — a behavior consistent with Newton’s first law of motion (the law of inertia).\n\n---\n\nRegarding the Moon's **rotation**, it is important to distinguish between **rotation** and **revolution**:\n\n- **Rotation** refers to the Moon spinning on its axis.\n- **Revolution** refers to the Moon orbiting around the Earth.\n\nCurrently, the Moon is **tidally locked** to the Earth, meaning that its rotational period is equal to its orbital period. This is a result of long-term gravitational interactions between the Earth and the Moon, which have gradually slowed the Moon’s rotation until it matches its orbital period. However, once the gravitational force is removed, this tidal locking would no longer be maintained.\n\nImportantly, **rotation is not inherently dependent on gravitational force**. The Moon, like any object in space, will continue to rotate on its axis at the same rate unless acted upon by an external torque. Since there is no such external force in this scenario (assuming no other celestial bodies are involved), the Moon would **continue to rotate on its axis** at the same rate it currently does.\n\n---\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the Moon’s motion in the absence of gravitational force is:\n\n- It **would continue rotating on its axis**, because there is no force to stop it.\n- It **would stop revolving around the Earth**, because there is no gravitational force to maintain its orbit.\n\n---\n\n**Correct Answer: B**  \n**It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth.**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so the question is about what would happen to the Moon if the force of gravity between it and the Earth suddenly stopped. The options are A to D, each giving a different scenario regarding the Moon's rotation and revolution.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how gravity affects the Moon. I know that the Earth's gravity is what keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth. Without gravity, the Moon wouldn't have the centripetal force needed to stay in orbit. So if gravity stopped, the Moon would no longer be held in its orbit. Instead, it would move in a straight line tangent to its orbit at the point where gravity ceased. So the Moon would stop revolving around the Earth.\n\nNow, about the rotation. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, meaning it rotates on its axis once per orbit. This is why we always see the same side of the Moon. But does the Moon's rotation depend on Earth's gravity? I think tidal locking is a result of gravitational interactions over time, but once the Moon is tidally locked, its rotation is synchronized with its orbit. If the gravity stops, the Moon would no longer be in orbit, but would it stop rotating? Or would it continue rotating on its axis as it moves off into space?\n\nWait, rotation is an inherent property of the Moon's motion. Unless there's a torque acting on it to change its rotation, it would continue rotating at the same rate. Since the gravitational force from the Earth was the one that caused tidal locking, if that force is removed, the Moon would still have its existing rotation. So if the Moon was rotating once per orbit (which is the current state due to tidal locking), and if it's no longer orbiting, but still rotating, then it would continue to rotate on its axis even though it's no longer revolving around the Earth. \n\nSo the correct answer would be that the Moon would continue rotating on its axis (since there's no force to stop it) but would stop revolving around the Earth. That matches option B.\n\nBut wait, is there any possibility that the Moon's rotation is somehow dependent on the gravitational force? For example, if the Moon is in orbit, its rotation is synchronized. If the orbit is removed, does the rotation also stop? No, I think rotation is independent once the tidal locking is achieved. Once tidal locking happens, the Moon's rotation is fixed relative to its orbital period. If the orbit is removed, the rotation would still continue. So the Moon would keep rotating on its axis, but since it's no longer orbiting, it wouldn't revolve around the Earth. So the answer should be B.\n</think>"}
