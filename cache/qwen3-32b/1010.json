The given information includes the dust sublimation temperature of 900 K and a bolometric luminosity of 1.5×10^46 erg/s. Also, there's a bolometric correction of 5 for the UV range luminosity. The answer choices are in parsecs, so I should end up with a value in that unit.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Barvainis model relates the inner radius of the torus to the luminosity of the AGN. The basic idea is that the dust in the torus sublimates when the temperature reaches a certain point, so the inner edge of the torus is determined by the temperature at which the dust can't exist anymore. The formula I think involves the luminosity and the sublimation temperature. \n\nThe standard formula for the radius is something like R = (L / (4πσT^4))^(1/2), but I need to recall the exact form. Wait, maybe it's derived from equating the flux from the AGN at the dust sublimation temperature to the flux that would cause the dust to sublimate. \n\nSo, the flux from the AGN at radius R is L / (4πR²), and this should equal σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So solving for R gives R = sqrt(L/(4πσT^4)). But I need to check the exact formula and also consider the bolometric correction.\n\nWait, the problem mentions a bolometric correction of 5 for the UV range. The bolometric luminosity is given as 1.5×10^46 erg/s. The bolometric correction is used to convert the UV luminosity to bolometric luminosity. But here, since we have the bolometric luminosity already, maybe the bolometric correction is actually used in the opposite way? Let me think. \n\nIf the Barvainis model uses the UV luminosity (L_uv) to calculate the radius, but we have the bolometric luminosity (L_bol), then we need to find L_uv using the bolometric correction. The bolometric correction (BC) is defined as BC = L_bol / L_uv. So if BC is 5, then L_uv = L_bol / BC = (1.5×10^46) / 5 = 3×10^45 erg/s. \n\nSo maybe the formula uses the UV luminosity instead of the bolometric. Therefore, I should use L_uv in the calculation of the radius. That makes sense because the original Barvainis model might have been based on UV observations. \n\nSo the formula would be R = sqrt(L_uv / (4πσT^4)). Let me plug in the numbers. \n\nFirst, let me note the values:\n\n- L_uv = 3×10^45 erg/s (after applying bolometric correction)\n- T = 900 K\n- σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) is approximately 5.67×10^-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4)\n\nSo R^2 = L_uv / (4πσT^4)\n\nCalculating T^4 first: 900^4 = (9×10^2)^4 = 9^4 × 10^8 = 6561 × 10^8 = 6.561×10^11 K^4\n\nThen, 4πσT^4 = 4 * π * 5.67×10^-5 * 6.561×10^11\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 4π ≈ 12.566\n\nThen, 12.566 * 5.67×10^-5 ≈ Let's calculate 12.566 * 5.67 ≈ 71.14 ×10^-5 = 7.114×10^-4\n\nThen multiply by 6.561×10^11: 7.114×10^-4 * 6.561×10^11 ≈ \n\nLet me compute 7.114 * 6.561 ≈ 46.7 (approximate). So 46.7 × 10^( -4 + 11 ) = 46.7 × 10^7 = 4.67×10^8 erg/s/cm²\n\nSo the denominator is approximately 4.67×10^8 erg/s/cm²\n\nNow, L_uv is 3×10^45 erg/s. Therefore, R^2 = 3×10^45 / 4.67×10^8 ≈ 6.42×10^37 cm²\n\nThen R = sqrt(6.42×10^37) cm ≈ 8×10^18 cm\n\nNow, converting cm to parsecs. I need to recall the conversion factor. 1 parsec is approximately 3.086×10^18 cm. So:\n\nR ≈ 8×10^18 cm / 3.086×10^18 cm/pc ≈ 2.59 pc\n\nHmm, that's approximately 2.6 parsecs. Looking at the options, option C is 3 pc. But my calculation gives around 2.6, which is closer to 3 than 0.6 or 0.1. However, maybe my approximations introduced some error. Let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, let me recalculate the exact value step by step.\n\nCompute T^4: 900^4 = 900*900*900*900. Let's compute that:\n\n900^2 = 810,000\n\n900^4 = (810,000)^2 = 8.1×10^5 squared = 6.561×10^11 K^4. Correct.\n\nThen 4πσT^4:\n\n4π = 12.566...\n\nσ = 5.67×10^-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4)\n\nSo 4πσT^4 = 12.566 * 5.67×10^-5 * 6.561×10^11\n\nLet me compute 12.566 * 5.67×10^-5 first:\n\n12.566 * 5.67 = let's calculate:\n\n12 * 5.67 = 68.04\n\n0.566 * 5.67 ≈ 3.20 (approx)\n\nTotal ≈ 68.04 + 3.20 = 71.24 ×10^-5 = 7.124×10^-4\n\nThen multiply by 6.561×10^11:\n\n7.124×10^-4 * 6.561×10^11 = 7.124 * 6.561 × 10^( -4 + 11 ) = ?\n\n7.124 * 6.561 ≈ Let me compute:\n\n7 * 6.561 = 45.927\n\n0.124 * 6.561 ≈ 0.8135\n\nTotal ≈ 45.927 + 0.8135 ≈ 46.74 ×10^7 = 4.674×10^8 erg/s/cm². Correct.\n\nSo denominator is 4.674×10^8 erg/s/cm².\n\nL_uv is 3×10^45 erg/s. So R² = 3×10^45 / 4.674×10^8 = (3 / 4.674) × 10^(45-8) ≈ 0.6415 × 10^37 = 6.415×10^36 cm². Wait, I previously wrote 6.42×10^37, but here it's 6.415×10^36. Wait, 3×10^45 divided by 4.674×10^8 is 3/(4.674) × 10^(45-8) = 0.6415 × 10^37? Wait no: 45-8 is 37, yes. So 3×10^45 / 4.674×10^8 = (3/4.674) × 10^37 ≈ 0.6415 ×10^37 = 6.415×10^36? Wait no, 0.6415 × 10^37 is 6.415×10^36? Wait, 0.6415 × 10^37 is 6.415 × 10^36? No, 0.6415 × 10^37 is 6.415 × 10^36. Yes. So R² = 6.415×10^36 cm². Therefore R is sqrt(6.415×10^36) cm = 8.01×10^18 cm.\n\nNow converting to parsecs: 1 pc = 3.086×10^18 cm.\n\nSo R = 8.01×10^18 / 3.086×10^18 ≈ 2.596 pc. So approximately 2.6 pc. The closest option is C: 3 pc. However, maybe there's a different version of the formula or a different value for the Stefan-Boltzmann constant or some other factor.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a factor in the formula. Let me check the standard formula again. The standard formula for the sublimation radius is R = (L / (4πσT^4))^(1/2). But sometimes, it's written as R = (L / (16πσT^4))^(1/2) because of the difference between the flux at the radius and the flux required to sublimate. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe flux from the AGN at radius R is L/(4πR²). The flux required to sublimate the dust is σT^4. So setting them equal:\n\nL/(4πR²) = σT^4\n\nSolving for R:\n\nR² = L/(4πσT^4)\n\nTherefore R = sqrt(L/(4πσT^4))\n\nSo my formula is correct. Therefore, the calculation should be correct. But maybe the bolometric correction was applied incorrectly. Let me check that again.\n\nThe problem says \"Assume bolometric correction of 5, for UV range luminosity.\" So if the Barvainis model uses the UV luminosity, and we have the bolometric luminosity, then the UV luminosity would be L_uv = L_bol / BC = 1.5×10^46 /5 = 3×10^45 erg/s. That's what I did. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the bolometric correction is defined as L_bol = BC * L_uv, then yes, that's right. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the Stefan-Boltzmann constant value is different? Let me check the exact value. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is σ = 5.670374419×10^-8 W/(m²·K⁴). Converting that to erg/(cm²·s·K⁴): 1 W = 10^7 erg/s, and 1 m² = 10^4 cm². So σ = 5.67×10^-8 W/(m²·K⁴) = 5.67×10^-8 * 10^7 erg/(s·m²·K⁴) = 5.67×10^-1 erg/(s·m²·K⁴). Then convert m² to cm²: 1 m² = 10^4 cm², so σ becomes 5.67×10^-1 / 10^4 erg/(s·cm²·K⁴) = 5.67×10^-5 erg/(s·cm²·K⁴). Which matches the value I used. So that's correct.\n\nSo my calculation is correct. The result is approximately 2.6 pc, which is closest to option C: 3 pc. However, the options are A:15, B:0.1, C:3, D:0.6. So 3 pc is option C. But maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me check if I used the correct luminosity.\n\nWait, the problem states the bolometric luminosity is 1.5×10^46 erg/s. Then using BC of 5, UV luminosity is 3×10^45 erg/s. But maybe the formula uses the bolometric luminosity directly without the correction? Wait, that would be inconsistent with the problem statement which mentions the BC. The problem says \"Assume bolometric correction of 5, for UV range luminosity\", so I think the BC is necessary here. Therefore, using L_uv is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses the bolometric luminosity directly. But then why mention the BC? Maybe the BC is not needed here. Wait, perhaps the Barvainis model uses the UV luminosity, and the bolometric correction is provided so that if the problem had given the UV luminosity, we could convert to bolometric. But since we have the bolometric luminosity, we divide by BC to get UV luminosity. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the BC is applied in the other direction. For example, if the model uses the bolometric luminosity, but the BC is 5, then maybe L_bol = 5 * L_uv, so L_uv = L_bol /5. Which is what I did. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. So the calculation gives approximately 2.6 pc. But the answer options don't have 2.6. The closest is 3 pc (option C). So I think the answer is C.\n\nBut let me check if there's a different formula or if I missed a factor. For example, sometimes the radius is calculated using R = (L / (16πσT^4))^(1/2). Wait, why would there be a 16π instead of 4π? Let me think again.\n\nThe flux from the AGN at radius R is L/(4πR²). The flux required to sublimate the dust is σT^4. So equating:\n\nL/(4πR²) = σT^4 → R² = L/(4πσT^4). So R = sqrt(L/(4πσT^4)). So the formula is correct. So no 16π factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different value for the Stefan-Boltzmann constant or a different temperature. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nLet me recalculate R in cm:\n\nR = sqrt(3×10^45 / (4π * 5.67×10^-5 * 6.561×10^11)) cm\n\nFirst compute denominator: 4π * 5.67×10^-5 * 6.561×10^11\n\nAs before, 4π*5.67×10^-5 ≈ 7.114×10^-4\n\nMultiply by 6.561×10^11: 7.114×10^-4 * 6.561×10^11 = 4.67×10^8 erg/s/cm².\n\nSo numerator is 3×10^45 erg/s.\n\nSo R² = 3×10^45 / 4.67×10^8 ≈ 6.42×10^36 cm²\n\nR ≈ 8.01×10^18 cm\n\nConvert to parsecs: 1 pc = 3.086×10^18 cm\n\nSo R ≈ 8.01×10^18 / 3.086×10^18 ≈ 2.596 pc ≈ 2.6 pc.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 2.6 pc, which is closest to option C:3 pc. Given the options, 3 pc is the correct choice.\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using more precise numbers.\n\nLet me compute the exact value of 3×10^45 / 4.67×10^8:\n\n3×10^45 / 4.67×10^8 = (3/4.67) × 10^(45-8) ≈ 0.642 × 10^37 = 6.42×10^36 cm².\n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(6.42×10^36) = sqrt(6.42) × 10^18 ≈ 2.534 × 10^18 cm? Wait no, sqrt(6.42×10^36) cm is sqrt(6.42) × 10^18 cm ≈ 2.534 × 10^18 cm? Wait no, 10^36 under sqrt is 10^18. So sqrt(6.42×10^36) = sqrt(6.42) × 10^18 cm ≈ 2.534 × 10^18 cm. Wait, but earlier I said it's 8×10^18 cm. Wait, this is a contradiction. Where did I go wrong here?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the R² is 6.42×10^36 cm². Therefore R is sqrt(6.42×10^36) cm = 2.534×10^18 cm? Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation where I had 8×10^18 cm. What's happening here?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, I said R² = 6.415×10^36 cm². Then R is sqrt(6.415×10^36) cm. Let's calculate sqrt(6.415×10^36). \n\nsqrt(6.415×10^36) = sqrt(6.415) × 10^18 cm ≈ 2.533 × 10^18 cm. \n\nBut earlier I said that R was 8×10^18 cm. That was a mistake! Wait, what's going on here? How did I get 8×10^18 cm before?\n\nWait, no, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me go back. \n\nWait, I had R² = 3×10^45 / 4.67×10^8 = 6.42×10^36 cm². Therefore R = sqrt(6.42×10^36) cm ≈ 2.53×10^18 cm. \n\nBut 1 pc is 3.086×10^18 cm. Therefore R ≈ 2.53×10^18 / 3.086×10^18 ≈ 0.82 pc. Wait, that's about 0.82 pc. But this contradicts my previous calculation where I thought R was 8×10^18 cm. Where did that mistake come from?\n\nAh! I see the mistake now. Earlier, I said R² = 6.42×10^37 cm², but that was incorrect. The correct R² is 6.42×10^36 cm². So sqrt(6.42×10^36) is 2.53×10^18 cm, not 8×10^18 cm. This was a critical error in the exponent. \n\nSo now, converting 2.53×10^18 cm to parsecs: \n\n2.53×10^18 cm / 3.086×10^18 cm/pc ≈ 0.82 pc. \n\nWhich is approximately 0.8 pc. The closest option is D:0.6 pc or B:0.1 pc. But 0.8 is closer to 0.6 than to 0.1, but maybe the calculation is off due to rounding. Let me recalculate with more precise numbers.\n\nLet me redo the entire calculation step by step carefully.\n\nGiven:\n\nL_uv = 3×10^45 erg/s\n\nT = 900 K\n\nσ = 5.67×10^-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4)\n\nR² = L_uv / (4πσT^4)\n\nFirst compute T^4:\n\n900^4 = 900 * 900 * 900 * 900\n\n900^2 = 810,000\n\n900^4 = 810,000^2 = 6.561×10^11 K^4\n\nNow compute denominator:\n\n4πσT^4 = 4 * π * 5.67×10^-5 * 6.561×10^11\n\nCalculate 4π ≈ 12.566370614\n\nMultiply by σ: 12.566370614 * 5.67×10^-5 ≈ \n\nLet me compute 12.566370614 * 5.67:\n\nFirst, 12 * 5.67 = 68.04\n\n0.566370614 * 5.67 ≈ 3.204 (approx)\n\nTotal ≈ 68.04 + 3.204 = 71.244 ×10^-5 = 7.1244×10^-4 erg/s/cm²\n\nNow multiply by T^4 (6.561×10^11 K^4):\n\n7.1244×10^-4 * 6.561×10^11 = \n\n7.1244 * 6.561 = let's calculate this more accurately:\n\n7 * 6.561 = 45.927\n\n0.1244 * 6.561 ≈ 0.8156\n\nTotal ≈ 45.927 + 0.8156 ≈ 46.7426 ×10^(-4 + 11) = 46.7426 ×10^7 = 4.67426×10^8 erg/s/cm²\n\nSo denominator is 4.67426×10^8 erg/s/cm²\n\nNow R² = 3×10^45 / 4.67426×10^8 ≈ \n\nCalculate 3 / 4.67426 ≈ 0.6415\n\nSo R² ≈ 0.6415 × 10^37 erg·cm²/s? Wait no, units are cm². Wait R² is in cm².\n\nSo R² ≈ 6.415×10^36 cm²\n\nThen R = sqrt(6.415×10^36) cm ≈ 2.533×10^18 cm\n\nNow convert to parsecs:\n\n1 parsec = 3.08567758×10^18 cm (exact value varies slightly, but commonly approximated as 3.086×10^18 cm)\n\nSo R ≈ 2.533×10^18 / 3.086×10^18 ≈ 0.821 pc\n\nSo approximately 0.82 parsecs. The options are B:0.1 pc, D:0.6 pc. 0.82 is closer to 0.6 than to 0.1? Well, 0.82 is 0.82, which is between 0.6 and 1.0. The closest option is D:0.6 pc. But the calculated value is about 0.82 pc, which is not exactly any of the options. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the bolometric correction. Let me check again. The problem says \"Assume bolometric correction of 5, for UV range luminosity\". So if the Barvainis model uses the UV luminosity, then L_uv = L_bol / BC = 1.5×10^46 /5 = 3×10^45 erg/s. That's correct. So no mistake there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula uses the bolometric luminosity directly, and the BC is not needed. Let me try that. Suppose I use L_bol instead of L_uv. Then:\n\nR² = 1.5×10^46 / (4.674×10^8) ≈ 3.21×10^37 cm²\n\nR = sqrt(3.21×10^37) ≈ 5.67×10^18 cm\n\nConvert to pc: 5.67×10^18 / 3.086×10^18 ≈ 1.84 pc. Still not matching any options. \n\nHmm. This suggests that there's a problem with the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (L / (16πσT^4))^(1/2) instead of 4π. Let's try that.\n\nIf R² = L_uv / (16πσT^4), then R² = 6.415×10^36 /4 = 1.604×10^36 cm², R ≈ 1.267×10^18 cm, which is 1.267×10^18 / 3.086×10^18 ≈ 0.41 pc. Closer to option D:0.6 pc. Still not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is R = (L / (4πσT^4))^(1/2) * (1/4), or some other factor. I'm confused now. Let me check literature or standard formula for the Barvainis model.\n\nWait, I remember that the standard formula for the torus radius is R_torus = (L / (16πσT^4))^(1/2). This comes from considering that the radiation from the AGN is isotropic and that the dust sublimation occurs when the flux equals σT^4. But maybe there's a factor of 4 difference due to the geometry or the assumption of the AGN being a blackbody. \n\nWait, another approach: the flux from the AGN at the dust radius is L/(4πR²). The flux required to sublimate the dust is σT^4. So setting them equal: L/(4πR²) = σT^4 → R = sqrt(L/(4πσT^4)). This is the same as before. So why am I getting 0.82 pc, which is not one of the options?\n\nThe options are A:15 pc, B:0.1 pc, C:3 pc, D:0.6 pc. My calculation gives 0.82 pc. The closest is D:0.6 pc. But maybe there's an error in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nLet me recalculate R in cm:\n\nR = sqrt(3×10^45 / (4π * 5.67×10^-5 * 6.561×10^11)) cm\n\nLet me compute the denominator numerically:\n\nFirst, 4π ≈ 12.566\n\nσ = 5.67×10^-5\n\nT^4 = 6.561×10^11\n\nMultiply them: 12.566 * 5.67×10^-5 = 7.114×10^-4\n\nThen multiply by 6.561×10^11: 7.114×10^-4 * 6.561×10^11 = 4.674×10^8\n\nSo denominator is 4.674×10^8 erg/s/cm²\n\nNumerator is 3×10^45 erg/s\n\nR² = 3×10^45 / 4.674×10^8 = 6.415×10^36 cm²\n\nR = sqrt(6.415×10^36) = 2.533×10^18 cm\n\nConvert to parsecs: 2.533×10^18 cm / 3.086×10^18 cm/pc ≈ 0.821 pc\n\nHmm. This is about 0.82 pc. The options are 0.6 pc (D) and 0.1 pc (B). Since 0.82 is closer to 0.6 than to 1.0, but it's not exactly any option. Maybe I missed a factor in the formula. Let me think about the standard formula for the torus radius.\n\nI recall that the standard formula is R = (L / (16πσT^4))^(1/2). If I use 16π instead of 4π, then R would be sqrt(1/4) = 1/2 of the previous value, so 0.41 pc. Still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the formula uses the bolometric luminosity directly without the bolometric correction. Let's try that. If I use L_bol = 1.5×10^46 erg/s, then R² = 1.5×10^46 / 4.674×10^8 = 3.21×10^37 cm², R = sqrt(3.21×10^37) ≈ 5.67×10^18 cm = 5.67×10^18 / 3.086×10^18 ≈ 1.84 pc. Still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the Stefan-Boltzmann constant was entered incorrectly. Let me double-check σ. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is σ = 5.67×10^-8 W/m²/K^4. Converting to erg/cm²/s/K^4: 1 W = 10^7 erg/s, and 1 m² = 10^4 cm². So σ = 5.67×10^-8 W/m²/K^4 = 5.67×10^-8 * 10^7 erg/(s·m²·K^4) = 5.67×10^-1 erg/(s·m²·K^4). Then divide by 10^4 cm²/m²: 5.67×10^-1 / 10^4 = 5.67×10^-5 erg/(s·cm²·K^4). Correct. So that's right.\n\nAnother possibility: the temperature is given as 900 K, but maybe the formula uses a different temperature, like the effective temperature or something else. But the problem states the sublimation temperature is 900 K, so that should be correct.\n\nWait, maybe the problem uses a different value for the bolometric correction? For example, if the BC is 5, but the actual BC used in the formula is different. Or maybe the BC is applied differently. For instance, if the BC is 5, but it's L_uv = 5 * L_bol, which would make L_uv = 7.5×10^46 erg/s, leading to a much larger R. Let's try that. If BC is defined as L_uv = BC * L_bol, then L_uv = 5 * 1.5×10^46 = 7.5×10^46 erg/s. Then R² = 7.5×10^46 / 4.674×10^8 ≈ 1.606×10^38 cm², R ≈ 4.01×10^19 cm. Convert to pc: 4.01×10^19 / 3.086×10^18 ≈ 13 pc. Which is option A:15 pc. But this would be if the BC is applied in the opposite way. \n\nThe problem says \"Assume bolometric correction of 5, for UV range luminosity\". The bolometric correction is typically defined as BC = L_bol / L_uv. So if you have the UV luminosity, you multiply by BC to get the bolometric. Conversely, if you have the bolometric, you divide by BC to get UV. So in this case, L_uv = L_bol / BC = 1.5e46 /5 = 3e45. But if the BC was defined as L_uv = BC * L_bol, then it would be 7.5e46. But that's not standard. The standard definition is BC = L_bol / L_uv, so L_uv = L_bol / BC. \n\nHowever, if the problem has a different definition, it could change the result. For example, if the BC is defined as L_uv = BC * L_bol, then L_uv = 5 * 1.5e46 = 7.5e46 erg/s, leading to R ≈ 13 pc, which is close to option A:15 pc. But this would be a non-standard definition. \n\nGiven that the problem states \"Assume bolometric correction of 5, for UV range luminosity\", it's likely that the BC is used to convert from UV to bolometric. So if you have UV luminosity, you multiply by BC to get bolometric. Therefore, if you have bolometric, you divide by BC to get UV. Hence, L_uv = 3e45 erg/s. \n\nBut with that, the calculation gives R ≈ 0.82 pc, which is not exactly any option. The closest is D:0.6 pc. Perhaps there's a rounding in the problem's constants. Let me try using more precise values for σ and π.\n\nLet me use π = 3.1416, σ = 5.670×10^-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4).\n\nRecalculate denominator:\n\n4πσT^4 = 4 * 3.1416 * 5.670×10^-5 * 6.561×10^11\n\nFirst, 4 * 3.1416 = 12.5664\n\n12.5664 * 5.670×10^-5 = 12.5664 * 5.670 = let's calculate:\n\n12 * 5.670 = 68.04\n\n0.5664 * 5.670 ≈ 3.204\n\nTotal ≈ 68.04 + 3.204 = 71.244 ×10^-5 = 7.1244×10^-4\n\nThen multiply by 6.561×10^11:\n\n7.1244×10^-4 * 6.561×10^11 = 7.1244 * 6.561 ×10^7 = 46.7426 ×10^7 = 4.67426×10^8 erg/s/cm². Same as before.\n\nSo no change. Hence, R is still ≈0.82 pc.\n\nGiven that the options are A:15, B:0.1, C:3, D:0.6, and the calculation gives ~0.82 pc, which is closest to D:0.6 pc. But it's not exact. Perhaps the problem expects using a different value for the Stefan-Boltzmann constant or some other approximation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula uses a different power of T. For example, if the formula is R ∝ L^0.5 / T^2, but with a different coefficient. Let me see.\n\nLet me try using R = (L / (4πσT^4))^(1/2) with L_uv = 3e45 erg/s.\n\nR = sqrt(3e45 / (4π * 5.67e-5 * 6.561e11)) cm\n\nAs before, this is sqrt(3e45 / 4.674e8) = sqrt(6.415e36) ≈ 2.53e18 cm.\n\nConvert to pc: 2.53e18 / 3.086e18 ≈ 0.82 pc.\n\nIf the problem expects an approximate value and rounds it, perhaps it's 0.6 pc (option D). Alternatively, maybe there's a missing factor of 4 in the denominator, leading to R = 0.41 pc, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is R = (L / (16πσT^4))^(1/2), which would give R = 0.82 / 2 = 0.41 pc. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses the luminosity in a different unit, like L_sun instead of erg/s? But the problem gives the luminosity in erg/s, so that's unlikely.\n\nAnother possibility: the temperature is 900 K, but the actual sublimation temperature is higher or lower. But the problem states it's 900 K, so that's given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is R = (L / (4πσT^4))^(1/2) * (1/4), which would give R = 0.82 / 2 = 0.41 pc. Still not matching.\n\nWait, let me check if the problem might have a typo in the bolometric correction. If the BC is 1/5 instead of 5, then L_uv = 1.5e46 *5 = 7.5e46, leading to R ≈ 13 pc, which is option A:15 pc. But that would be a huge mistake in the BC definition. \n\nAlternatively, if the BC is 5, but it's applied to the bolometric luminosity to get the UV, but the formula uses the bolometric directly, then R would be sqrt(1.5e46 / 4.674e8) ≈ sqrt(3.21e37) ≈ 5.67e18 cm = 1.84 pc, which is not an option either.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most plausible conclusion is that the correct answer is D:0.6 pc, assuming that the calculation rounds 0.82 pc to the nearest option. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me try using all precise numbers with more decimal places.\n\nLet me recalculate R in pc with precise calculation.\n\nR = sqrt(L_uv / (4πσT^4)) / (3.086×10^18 cm/pc)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nR = sqrt( (3×10^45) / (4 * π * 5.67×10^-5 * 900^4) ) / 3.086×10^18\n\nCompute numerator inside sqrt:\n\n3×10^45 / (4 * π * 5.67×10^-5 * 900^4)\n\nCalculate denominator inside sqrt:\n\n4 * π * 5.67×10^-5 * 900^4\n\nFirst, 900^4 = 6.561×10^11\n\nThen, 4 * π ≈ 12.566370614\n\n12.566370614 * 5.67×10^-5 = 12.566370614 * 5.67e-5 = let's calculate:\n\n12.566370614 * 5.67e-5 = 0.000711449\n\nThen multiply by 6.561e11:\n\n0.000711449 * 6.561e11 = 0.000711449 * 6.561e11 = 4.674e8\n\nSo denominator is 4.674e8, so the numerator inside sqrt is 3e45 / 4.674e8 = 6.415e36.\n\nSo R = sqrt(6.415e36) / 3.086e18 = (2.533e18) / 3.086e18 = 0.821 pc.\n\nSo it's precisely 0.821 pc. Given the options, the closest is D:0.6 pc, but it's not exact. Perhaps the problem uses a different value for σ or assumes a different temperature. For example, if T is 1000 K instead of 900 K, let's see:\n\nT = 1000 K, T^4 = 1e12 K^4.\n\nDenominator: 4πσT^4 = 4.674e8 * (1e12 / 6.561e11) = 4.674e8 * 1.524 = 7.12e8.\n\nR² = 3e45 / 7.12e8 = 4.21e36, R = 6.49e18 cm = 6.49e18 / 3.086e18 = 2.1 pc. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if T is 1200 K, T^4 = (1200/900)^4 * 6.561e11 = (1.333)^4 * 6.561e11 ≈ 3.16 * 6.561e11 ≈ 2.07e12 K^4.\n\nDenominator: 4πσT^4 = 4.674e8 * (2.07e12 / 6.561e11) ≈ 4.674e8 * 3.155 ≈ 1.473e9.\n\nR² = 3e45 / 1.473e9 ≈ 2.037e36, R ≈ 4.51e18 cm = 4.51e18 / 3.086e18 ≈ 1.46 pc. Still not matching.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 0.82 pc, which is closest to option D:0.6 pc. However, since the calculation is precise and the options are discrete, it's possible that there's an error in the problem's options or in my calculation. But given the steps, I think the answer should be D:0.6 pc.\n</think>"}
