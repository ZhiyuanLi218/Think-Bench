Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the function f is defined for non-negative integers i and j, where j is between 0 and 4 inclusive. The codomain is {0,1,2,3,4}, so all outputs are modulo 5 remainders. The definition is given with three cases:\n\n1. When i = 0, f(0, j) is mod5(j + 1). That seems straightforward. For example, if j is 0, then mod5(0 + 1) = 1; if j is 1, mod5(2) = 2, etc. So for i=0, f(0,j) is just j+1 mod 5.\n\n2. When i ≥ 1 and j = 0, f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). So to get f(i, 0), we look at the previous i level, but with j=1.\n\n3. When i ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). This is a recursive definition where to compute f(i, j), we need to compute f(i, j - 1) first, then use that result as the second argument to f(i - 1, ...).\n\nSo, since we need to compute f(2015, 2), which is a very high i value, I suspect that there is some periodicity or pattern that we can exploit here. Direct computation is impossible due to the size of i. So my goal is to find a pattern or formula for f(i, j) for different i and j.\n\nLet me start by computing some small values of i and j to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n\nFor i = 0, as per definition:\n\n- f(0, 0) = mod5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = mod5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = 3\n- f(0, 3) = 4\n- f(0, 4) = mod5(4 + 1) = 0\n\nSo f(0, j) = (j + 1) mod 5.\n\nNow let's compute i = 1.\n\nFor i = 1:\n\nFirst, f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2 (from above).\n\nNow for j = 1 to 4:\n\nf(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0)) = f(0, 2) = 3.\n\nf(1, 2) = f(0, f(1, 1)) = f(0, 3) = 4.\n\nf(1, 3) = f(0, f(1, 2)) = f(0, 4) = 0.\n\nf(1, 4) = f(0, f(1, 3)) = f(0, 0) = 1.\n\nSo for i=1, the values are:\n\nj=0: 2, j=1:3, j=2:4, j=3:0, j=4:1.\n\nSo f(1, j) = (j + 2) mod 5? Let's check:\n\nFor j=0: 0 + 2 = 2 mod5, yes.\n\nj=1: 1 + 2 = 3 mod5, yes.\n\nj=2: 4, which is 2 + 2 = 4, yes.\n\nj=3: 3 + 2 = 5 ≡ 0 mod5, yes.\n\nj=4: 4 + 2 = 6 ≡ 1 mod5, yes. So f(1, j) = (j + 2) mod5.\n\nInteresting. Let's check for i=2.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nFirst, f(2, 0) = f(1, 1) = 3.\n\nThen:\n\nf(2,1) = f(1, f(2,0)) = f(1, 3) = 0 (from i=1, j=3).\n\nf(2,2) = f(1, f(2,1)) = f(1, 0) = 2 (from i=1, j=0).\n\nf(2,3) = f(1, f(2,2)) = f(1, 2) = 4 (from i=1, j=2).\n\nf(2,4) = f(1, f(2,3)) = f(1, 4) = 1 (from i=1, j=4).\n\nSo for i=2, the values are:\n\nj=0:3, j=1:0, j=2:2, j=3:4, j=4:1.\n\nHmm, not sure if there's an obvious pattern here. Let's check if there's a formula. Maybe not straightforward addition. Let me note down the values:\n\ni=0: [1,2,3,4,0]\n\ni=1: [2,3,4,0,1]\n\ni=2: [3,0,2,4,1]\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as some operation. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute more values. Let's compute i=3.\n\nFor i=3:\n\nf(3, 0) = f(2, 1) = 0.\n\nThen:\n\nf(3,1) = f(2, f(3,0)) = f(2, 0) = 3.\n\nf(3,2) = f(2, f(3,1)) = f(2, 3) = 4.\n\nf(3,3) = f(2, f(3,2)) = f(2, 4) = 1.\n\nf(3,4) = f(2, f(3,3)) = f(2, 1) = 0.\n\nSo for i=3:\n\nj=0:0, j=1:3, j=2:4, j=3:1, j=4:0.\n\nHmm. Let's do i=4.\n\nf(4,0) = f(3,1) = 3.\n\nThen:\n\nf(4,1) = f(3, f(4,0)) = f(3, 3) = 1.\n\nf(4,2) = f(3, f(4,1)) = f(3, 1) = 3.\n\nf(4,3) = f(3, f(4,2)) = f(3, 3) = 1.\n\nf(4,4) = f(3, f(4,3)) = f(3, 1) = 3.\n\nSo for i=4:\n\nj=0:3, j=1:1, j=2:3, j=3:1, j=4:3.\n\nHmm. Let me do i=5.\n\nf(5,0) = f(4,1) = 1.\n\nThen:\n\nf(5,1) = f(4, f(5,0)) = f(4,1) = 1.\n\nf(5,2) = f(4, f(5,1)) = f(4,1) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, f(5,3) = f(4,1) = 1, and f(5,4) = f(4,1) = 1.\n\nSo for i=5:\n\nj=0:1, and all other j from 1 to 4: 1.\n\nSimilarly, for i=6:\n\nf(6,0) = f(5,1) = 1.\n\nThen f(6,1) = f(5, f(6,0)) = f(5,1) = 1. Similarly, all others will be 1. So for i ≥ 5, all f(i,j) = 1? Wait, but let me check i=5, j=0 is 1, and for j≥1, also 1. Then for i=6, same thing. So perhaps from i=5 onwards, all f(i,j) = 1?\n\nBut let me check i=4, j=0 is 3, j=1 is 1, etc. So maybe there's a pattern where after some point, the function stabilizes to 1 for all j?\n\nBut let me check i=5, j=0 is 1, then for i=5, j=1: f(4, f(5,0)) = f(4,1) = 1, yes. Similarly for all higher j. So once we hit i=5, all the f(i,j) become 1. Then for i=6, same thing. Therefore, if this pattern continues, then for all i ≥ 5, f(i,j) = 1 for all j. \n\nBut 2015 is way larger than 5. So if that's the case, then f(2015, 2) would be 1? But let me verify this more carefully. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me recap the values:\n\ni=0: [1,2,3,4,0]\n\ni=1: [2,3,4,0,1]\n\ni=2: [3,0,2,4,1]\n\ni=3: [0,3,4,1,0]\n\nWait, earlier I wrote for i=3: j=0:0, j=1:3, j=2:4, j=3:1, j=4:0. Yes.\n\ni=4: [3,1,3,1,3]\n\ni=5: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\ni=6: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo if this is correct, then for i ≥ 5, f(i,j)=1 for all j. Therefore, f(2015, 2) would be 1. However, I need to make sure that my calculation for i=3, i=4, i=5 is correct. Let me recheck them step by step.\n\nStarting with i=2:\n\nf(2,0) = f(1,1) = 3 (from i=1, j=1 is 3). Correct.\n\nf(2,1) = f(1, f(2,0)) = f(1, 3). From i=1, j=3 is 0. So f(2,1)=0. Correct.\n\nf(2,2) = f(1, f(2,1)) = f(1, 0) = 2 (from i=1, j=0 is 2). Correct.\n\nf(2,3) = f(1, f(2,2)) = f(1, 2) = 4. Correct.\n\nf(2,4) = f(1, f(2,3)) = f(1, 4) = 1. Correct. So i=2 is correct.\n\ni=3:\n\nf(3,0) = f(2,1) = 0. Correct.\n\nf(3,1) = f(2, f(3,0)) = f(2,0) = 3. Correct.\n\nf(3,2) = f(2, f(3,1)) = f(2,3) = 4. Correct.\n\nf(3,3) = f(2, f(3,2)) = f(2,4) = 1. Correct.\n\nf(3,4) = f(2, f(3,3)) = f(2,1) = 0. Correct. So i=3 is correct.\n\ni=4:\n\nf(4,0) = f(3,1) = 3. Correct.\n\nf(4,1) = f(3, f(4,0)) = f(3,3) = 1. Correct.\n\nf(4,2) = f(3, f(4,1)) = f(3,1) = 3. Correct.\n\nf(4,3) = f(3, f(4,2)) = f(3,3) = 1. Correct.\n\nf(4,4) = f(3, f(4,3)) = f(3,1) = 3. Correct. So i=4 is correct.\n\ni=5:\n\nf(5,0) = f(4,1) = 1. Correct.\n\nf(5,1) = f(4, f(5,0)) = f(4,1) = 1. Correct.\n\nf(5,2) = f(4, f(5,1)) = f(4,1) = 1. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for f(5,3) and f(5,4). So yes, i=5 gives all 1s. Then for i=6, f(6,0)=f(5,1)=1, and then all subsequent j's will be f(5, something) which is 1, so f(6,j) = 1 for all j. Therefore, for i ≥ 5, all outputs are 1.\n\nTherefore, since 2015 is much larger than 5, f(2015, 2) = 1. But let me check if there is a possibility that maybe the pattern changes again for higher i. For example, if i=5, all are 1s. Let me check i=6:\n\nf(6, 0) = f(5,1) = 1.\n\nf(6,1) = f(5, f(6,0)) = f(5,1) = 1. Similarly, f(6,2) = f(5, f(6,1)) = f(5,1)=1. So yes, it's stuck at 1 forever.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that for i ≥ 5, f(i,j) = 1 for all j. Therefore, f(2015, 2) = 1. But let me check if there's another way to think about this, perhaps in terms of hyperoperators or something similar, to see if this pattern is expected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a general formula for f(i,j). Let's think recursively. The function resembles the Ackermann function, which is known for its rapid growth and complex recursion. However, since we are working modulo 5, the values are bounded, so perhaps the recursion stabilizes.\n\nLooking at the results:\n\nFor i=0: f(0,j) = j+1 mod5.\n\nFor i=1: f(1,j) = j + 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but when j=4, 4 + 2 = 6 ≡ 1 mod5, which matches. But for i=2, the values don't follow j + something. For i=2, j=0:3; j=1:0; j=2:2; j=3:4; j=4:1. Not a simple shift. However, maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(i,j) corresponds to some kind of modular exponentiation or iteration. Let's think about what the recursion does.\n\nFor each i, f(i,j) is defined in terms of f(i-1,...). For j ≥ 1, it's f(i-1, f(i, j-1)). So for each j, we're applying f(i, j-1) as an argument to f(i-1, ...). This seems similar to function iteration. For example, f(i,j) could be thought of as applying the function f(i-1, ...) multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, for fixed i, f(i,j) can be seen as a function of j, built up recursively. For example, for i=1:\n\nf(1, j) = f(0, f(1, j-1)) with f(1,0)=f(0,1)=2. Since f(0,x) = x+1 mod5, then f(1,j) is essentially adding 1, j times? Wait, but starting from 2. Let's see:\n\nFor i=1, j=0: 2\n\nj=1: f(0, f(1,0)) = 0 + 1? Wait, f(1,0) is 2, so f(0, 2) is 3. So adding 1 once to 2?\n\nSimilarly, f(1,1) = 2 + 1 = 3, f(1,2) = 3 + 1 = 4, f(1,3) = 4 + 1 = 5 ≡ 0, f(1,4) = 0 + 1 = 1. So yes, f(1,j) = (2 + j) mod5. Which is same as (j + 2) mod5, which matches our previous result.\n\nSimilarly, for i=2, f(2,j). Let's think recursively. For i=2, f(2,j) = f(1, f(2, j-1)), with f(2,0) = f(1,1) = 3.\n\nSo starting with f(2,0) = 3. Then f(2,1) = f(1, f(2,0)) = f(1, 3) = 0. Then f(2,2) = f(1, 0) = 2, f(2,3) = f(1, 2) = 4, f(2,4) = f(1,4) = 1. \n\nSo for i=2, each step applies the i=1 function to the previous result. Since the i=1 function is adding 1 mod5, then f(2,j) is applying the \"add 1\" operation j times starting from 3? Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for i=2, j=1: apply f(1, ...) once to f(2,0). For j=2: apply f(1, ...) to f(2,1), which is applying it twice? Wait, maybe not. Let me think in terms of function iteration.\n\nIf we think of f(i, j) as applying some operation j times. For example, for i=1, it's adding 1, j times. For i=2, perhaps it's something else. But since f(2, j) = f(1, f(2, j-1)), which is like saying f(2, j) is f(1) applied to f(2, j-1). If we consider f(2, j) as the result of applying f(1, ...) j times to f(2, 0). \n\nSince f(2, 0) is 3, then f(2,1) is f(1, 3) = 0, f(2,2) is f(1, 0) = 2, f(2,3) is f(1, 2) = 3? Wait no, f(2,3) was 4. Wait:\n\nWait f(2,0)=3\n\nf(2,1)=f(1,3)=0\n\nf(2,2)=f(1,0)=2\n\nf(2,3)=f(1,2)=3 + 1? Wait f(1,2) is 4. Wait f(1,2)= (2 + 2) mod5? Wait no, earlier we saw that f(1,j)=j + 2 mod5. Wait for j=2, that would be 2 + 2 = 4 mod5. Yes. So f(1,2)=4. Therefore, f(2,3)=4. Then f(2,4)=f(1,4)= (4 + 2)=6≡1 mod5. So yes. \n\nSo if we think of f(2,j) as starting at 3 and applying the \"add 2\" operation j times? Wait, no. Because starting at 3, adding 2 once would be 5≡0, adding 2 again is 2, adding 2 again is 4, adding 2 again is 6≡1. Which matches the values for f(2,j). So if we think of f(2,j) as (3 + 2j) mod5? Let's check:\n\nFor j=0: 3 + 0 = 3 mod5, yes.\n\nj=1: 3 + 2(1)=5≡0, yes.\n\nj=2: 3 + 4=7≡2, yes.\n\nj=3: 3 + 6=9≡4, yes.\n\nj=4: 3 + 8=11≡1, yes. Perfect! So f(2,j) = (3 + 2j) mod5. Interesting. So maybe there's a general formula here?\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, f(1,j) = (j + 2) mod5 = (1* j + 2) mod5?\n\nWait, but for i=2, it's (2* j + 3) mod5? Wait 2j + 3? For j=0: 3, j=1: 5≡0, etc. Yes. But where do these coefficients come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(i,j) relates to some combination of i and j with coefficients. Let's see:\n\nFor i=0: f(0,j)=j +1 mod5.\n\ni=1: f(1,j)=j + 2 mod5.\n\ni=2: f(2,j)=2j + 3 mod5?\n\nWait for i=2, if we think of it as 2j + 3. For j=0: 3, yes. For j=1: 2 + 3=5≡0, yes. For j=2: 4 + 3=7≡2, yes. For j=3: 6 + 3=9≡4, yes. For j=4: 8 + 3=11≡1, yes. So yes, that works. Interesting. Let me check if this pattern continues for i=3.\n\nFor i=3, we had the values:\n\nj=0:0, j=1:3, j=2:4, j=3:1, j=4:0.\n\nLet me see if there is a formula here. Let me check if it's of the form something * j + something mod5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for i=3, f(3,j) = 2^{j} * something mod5? Let me see. Alternatively, since i=2 was linear in j, maybe i=3 is exponential?\n\nAlternatively, let's think recursively. For i=3, f(3,j) = f(2, f(3, j-1)), with f(3,0) = f(2,1)=0.\n\nSo f(3,0) = 0.\n\nf(3,1) = f(2, f(3,0)) = f(2, 0) = 3.\n\nf(3,2) = f(2, f(3,1)) = f(2, 3) = 4.\n\nf(3,3) = f(2, f(3,2)) = f(2, 4) = 1.\n\nf(3,4) = f(2, f(3,3)) = f(2, 1) = 0.\n\nSo if I think of f(3,j), starting from 0, then applying f(2, ...). Since f(2,x) is 2x + 3 mod5. Therefore, f(3,j) can be considered as iterating the function g(x) = 2x + 3 mod5, starting from x=0.\n\nLet me check:\n\nStart with x0 = 0.\n\nx1 = g(x0) = 2*0 + 3 = 3.\n\nx2 = g(x1) = 2*3 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 ≡ 4.\n\nx3 = g(x2) = 2*4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ≡ 1.\n\nx4 = g(x3) = 2*1 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 ≡ 0.\n\nWhich matches the values of f(3,j). Therefore, f(3,j) is the result of applying the function g(x) = 2x + 3 mod5, j times starting from 0. \n\nSimilarly, for i=4, f(4,j) = f(3, f(4, j-1)) with f(4,0) = f(3,1) = 3. So starting from 3 and applying the function h(x) = f(3,x). But f(3,x) is applying g(x) multiple times. However, since for i=3, the function is complicated, maybe we can find a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to compute f(4,j):\n\nFor i=4, starting with f(4,0) = 3.\n\nf(4,1) = f(3, f(4,0)) = f(3, 3) = 1.\n\nf(4,2) = f(3, f(4,1)) = f(3,1) = 3.\n\nf(4,3) = f(3, f(4,2)) = f(3,3) = 1.\n\nf(4,4) = f(3, f(4,3)) = f(3,1) = 3.\n\nSo the sequence is [3,1,3,1,3]. So for even j, starting from 0, it's 3, and for odd j, it's 1. Since j ranges from 0 to 4. So perhaps for i=4, f(4,j) = 3 if j is even, 1 if j is odd. Let me check:\n\nFor j=0 (even): 3, yes.\n\nj=1 (odd):1, yes.\n\nj=2 (even):3, yes.\n\nj=3 (odd):1, yes.\n\nj=4 (even):3, yes. Correct. So for i=4, f(4,j) alternates between 3 and 1 depending on the parity of j. Interesting.\n\nThen for i=5, f(5,0) = f(4,1) = 1. Then f(5,j) = f(4, f(5, j-1)). Let's see:\n\nStarting with f(5,0)=1.\n\nf(5,1) = f(4, f(5,0)) = f(4,1) = 1.\n\nf(5,2) = f(4, f(5,1)) = f(4,1) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, all subsequent f(5,j) will be 1. Therefore, once we reach i=5, it's stuck at 1.\n\nSo perhaps there's a pattern here where for each i, the function f(i,j) is some operation that eventually collapses to 1 for higher i. \n\nBut how can we generalize this? Maybe there's a way to model f(i,j) as some hyperoperation or in terms of the previous functions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think in terms of the number of times you have to apply previous operations. For example, for i=1, it's adding 1; for i=2, it's multiplying by 2 and adding 3; for i=3, it's iterating that linear function; for i=4, it's oscillating between values; and then for i=5, it's fixed. \n\nBut perhaps instead of trying to find a general formula, since we saw that for i ≥ 5, all f(i,j)=1, and since 2015 is much larger than 5, the answer is 1. But to make sure, let me check for i=5 and i=6 again.\n\nFor i=5, as we saw, all f(5,j)=1. For i=6, f(6,0)=f(5,1)=1, then f(6,1)=f(5, f(6,0))=f(5,1)=1, and so on. So indeed, once we hit 1, it remains 1. Therefore, for any i ≥ 5 and any j, f(i,j)=1. Therefore, f(2015,2)=1. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if maybe there's a cycle or something for lower i. For example, maybe for some i, the function cycles between values. However, since for i=5, we already reach 1 and it's fixed, and since the problem is about i=2015, which is way beyond 5, the answer is 1. \n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose we think of the function f(i,j) as similar to the Ackermann function. The Ackermann function is known for its rapid growth, but in our case, since we are working modulo 5, the values are bounded, so the recursion must eventually stabilize. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find for each i, the value of the minimal i where f(i,j) becomes 1 for all j. In our case, for i=5, it's already 1. Let me check if for i=4, f(4,2)=3, which then for i=5, f(5,2)=1. So yes, once i reaches 5, all outputs become 1.\n\nTherefore, given that 2015 is much larger than 5, f(2015,2)=1. Therefore, the answer is 1. \n\nHowever, just to be 100% sure, let me check for i=5 and j=2. Since for i=5, all j should be 1. Let me recompute f(5,2):\n\nf(5,2) = f(4, f(5,1)) = f(4,1) = 1. Correct. Similarly, for i=5, j=2: 1. Therefore, yes. \n\nTherefore, I think confidently that the answer is 1. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>"}
