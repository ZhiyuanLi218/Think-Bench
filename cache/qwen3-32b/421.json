I need to find the pH of a hypochlorous acid solution. The problem says they dissolved 0.1665 moles of HClO in 500 mL of water. The Ka is 3.0 × 10^-4. The options are given, but I need to work it out step by step.\n\nFirst, hypochlorous acid is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't completely dissociate in water. That means I can't just take the concentration and directly get the pH like with a strong acid. Instead, I need to use the Ka value to find the concentration of H+ ions.\n\nLet me start by calculating the initial concentration of HClO. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. So moles divided by volume gives me molarity. The moles are 0.1665, so 0.1665 / 0.5 = 0.333 M. Wait, let me check that. 0.1665 divided by 0.5 is indeed 0.333 M. Okay, so the initial concentration of HClO is 0.333 M.\n\nNow, since it's a weak acid, it will dissociate in water as HClO ⇌ H+ + ClO-. The Ka expression is [H+][ClO-]/[HClO] = 3.0 × 10^-4.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of H+ as x. At equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n\n[H+] = x\n\n[ClO-] = x\n\n[HClO] = 0.333 - x\n\nBut since Ka is small, maybe x is negligible compared to 0.333? Let me check if I can approximate 0.333 - x ≈ 0.333. If that's the case, the equation simplifies to:\n\nKa ≈ x² / 0.333\n\nSo solving for x:\n\nx² = Ka × 0.333 = 3.0 × 10^-4 × 0.333 ≈ 9.99 × 10^-5\n\nTaking the square root of that gives x ≈ sqrt(9.99 × 10^-5) ≈ 0.009995 M. So approximately 0.01 M. Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.333:\n\n3.0 × 0.333 = 0.999, so 0.999 × 10^-4 ≈ 9.99 × 10^-5. Then sqrt(9.99 × 10^-5) is sqrt(9.99) × 10^-2.5. Wait, sqrt(9.99) is about 3.16, so 3.16 × 10^-2.5? Wait, no. Wait, 10^-4 is (10^-2)^2, so sqrt(9.99 × 10^-5) = sqrt(9.99) × 10^-2.5? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of decimal exponents. Alternatively, sqrt(9.99 × 10^-5) is sqrt(9.99) × sqrt(10^-5) = 3.16 × 10^(-2.5). But 10^(-2.5) is 10^(-2) × 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.01 × 0.316 ≈ 0.00316. So 3.16 × 0.00316 ≈ 0.00999? Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe my approach is confusing.\n\nWait, let me just do it numerically. sqrt(9.99 × 10^-5) is sqrt(0.0000999). Let me compute that. The square of 0.01 is 0.0001, which is 1 × 10^-4. Our value is 9.99 × 10^-5, which is just slightly less than 1 × 10^-4. So sqrt(9.99 × 10^-5) is slightly less than 0.01. Let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nLet me use the approximation for sqrt(a - ε) ≈ sqrt(a) - ε/(2 sqrt(a)) where a is 1 × 10^-4 and ε is 1 × 10^-6 (since 9.99 × 10^-5 = 1 × 10^-4 - 1 × 10^-6). But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me note that 0.00995^2 = ?\n\n0.00995^2 = (0.01 - 0.00005)^2 = 0.0001 - 2*0.01*0.00005 + (0.00005)^2 ≈ 0.0001 - 0.000001 + negligible ≈ 0.000099. Which is 9.9 × 10^-5. Our target is 9.99 × 10^-5. So 0.00995^2 ≈ 9.9 × 10^-5. The difference between 9.9 × 10^-5 and 9.99 × 10^-5 is 0.09 × 10^-4. So to get a better approximation, maybe add a small delta to 0.00995. Let me call x = 0.00995 + δ. Then x^2 ≈ 9.9 × 10^-5 + 2*0.00995*δ. We want this to equal 9.99 × 10^-5. So:\n\n9.9 × 10^-5 + 2*0.00995*δ = 9.99 × 10^-5\n\nSo 2*0.00995*δ = 0.09 × 10^-4 = 9 × 10^-6\n\nTherefore, δ ≈ (9 × 10^-6) / (0.0199) ≈ 4.52 × 10^-4\n\nSo x ≈ 0.00995 + 0.000452 ≈ 0.0104 M. Wait, but that would give x^2 ≈ (0.0104)^2 = 0.000108, which is 1.08 × 10^-4, which is higher than our target. Hmm, maybe my linear approximation isn't sufficient here. Alternatively, maybe I can just accept that the value is approximately 0.009995 M, which is roughly 0.01 M. So x ≈ 0.01 M.\n\nBut let's check if the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.333 is valid. If x is 0.01, then 0.333 - 0.01 = 0.323, which is still approximately 0.333. So the approximation holds. Therefore, the concentration of H+ is approximately 0.01 M, so pH = -log(0.01) = 2. But wait, the answer options include B:2 and D:1.76. Let me check if my approximation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should solve the quadratic equation to be more accurate. Let's try that. The exact equation is:\n\nKa = x² / (0.333 - x) = 3.0 × 10^-4\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nx² = 3.0 × 10^-4 (0.333 - x)\n\nx² = 9.99 × 10^-5 - 3.0 × 10^-4 x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx² + 3.0 × 10^-4 x - 9.99 × 10^-5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where:\n\na = 1\n\nb = 3.0 × 10^-4\n\nc = -9.99 × 10^-5\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nPlugging in:\n\nDiscriminant D = b² - 4ac = (3.0 × 10^-4)^2 - 4*1*(-9.99 × 10^-5)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(3.0 × 10^-4)^2 = 9.0 × 10^-8\n\n-4ac = -4*1*(-9.99 × 10^-5) = 3.996 × 10^-4\n\nSo D = 9.0 × 10^-8 + 3.996 × 10^-4 ≈ 3.996 × 10^-4 + 0.00000009 ≈ approximately 3.996 × 10^-4\n\nSo sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(3.996 × 10^-4) ≈ sqrt(4 × 10^-4 - 0.004 × 10^-4) ≈ sqrt(0.0003996). Let me compute that. sqrt(0.0004) is 0.02. So sqrt(0.0003996) is slightly less than 0.02. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nLet me denote y = 0.02 - δ. Then y² = 0.0004 - 0.04δ + δ² ≈ 0.0004 - 0.04δ. We want this to equal 0.0003996. So:\n\n0.0004 - 0.04δ ≈ 0.0003996 → 0.04δ ≈ 0.0000004 → δ ≈ 0.0000004 / 0.04 = 0.00001. Therefore, y ≈ 0.02 - 0.00001 = 0.01999. So sqrt(D) ≈ 0.01999.\n\nTherefore, x = [-b ± sqrt(D)] / 2a. Since x must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\nx = [ -3.0 × 10^-4 + 0.01999 ] / 2 ≈ (0.01999 - 0.0003) / 2 ≈ 0.01969 / 2 ≈ 0.009845 M.\n\nSo x ≈ 0.009845 M. Therefore, the concentration of H+ is approximately 0.009845 M. Then pH = -log(0.009845). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, log(0.009845) = log(9.845 × 10^-3) = log(9.845) + log(10^-3) ≈ 0.993 - 3 = -2.007. Therefore, pH ≈ 2.007. So approximately 2.01. So the pH is about 2.01, which is very close to 2. So answer B:2 is correct?\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistakes in calculation. Let me recalculate the quadratic solution step by step.\n\nOriginal equation: x² + 3.0 × 10^-4 x - 9.99 × 10^-5 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = (3.0 × 10^-4)^2 + 4 * 9.99 × 10^-5. Wait, earlier I said D = b² - 4ac. Since c is negative, -4ac becomes positive. Let me recast:\n\na = 1, b = 3.0 × 10^-4, c = -9.99 × 10^-5\n\nD = b² - 4ac = (3.0 × 10^-4)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-9.99 × 10^-5) = 9.0 × 10^-8 + 3.996 × 10^-4 ≈ 3.996 × 10^-4 + 9.0 × 10^-8. Since 9.0 × 10^-8 is negligible compared to 3.996 × 10^-4, we can approximate D ≈ 3.996 × 10^-4. So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(3.996 × 10^-4) ≈ 0.01999 as before.\n\nThen x = [-3.0 × 10^-4 + 0.01999]/2 ≈ (0.01999 - 0.0003)/2 ≈ 0.01969/2 ≈ 0.009845 M. Correct.\n\nSo [H+] ≈ 0.009845 M. pH = -log(0.009845). Let me compute log(0.009845):\n\nFirst, log(1 × 10^-2) = -2. log(9.845 × 10^-3) = log(9.845) + log(10^-3) = log(9.845) - 3.\n\nNow, log(9.845) can be approximated. Since log(10) = 1, log(9.845) is slightly less than 1. Let me recall that log(9.845) ≈ 0.993. Let me verify:\n\nlog(9) = 0.9542, log(9.845) is closer to 1. Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me remember that log(9.8) is approximately 0.9912, and log(9.845) is a bit more.\n\nAlternatively, using linear approximation between log(9.8) and log(9.9):\n\nlog(9.8) ≈ 0.9912\n\nlog(9.9) ≈ 0.9956\n\nThe difference between 9.8 and 9.9 is 0.1. Our value is 9.845, which is 0.045 above 9.8. So fractionally, 0.045 / 0.1 = 0.45. The difference in log is 0.9956 - 0.9912 = 0.0044. So 0.45 * 0.0044 ≈ 0.00198. Therefore, log(9.845) ≈ 0.9912 + 0.00198 ≈ 0.9932. Therefore, log(9.845 × 10^-3) ≈ 0.9932 - 3 = -2.0068. Therefore, pH ≈ 2.0068, which is approximately 2.01. So pH ≈ 2.01.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option B is 2. But option D is 1.76. Wait, why is there a discrepancy? Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, let me check the initial concentration again. The problem says 0.1665 moles in 500 mL. 0.1665 divided by 0.5 is indeed 0.333 M. Correct. The Ka is 3.0 × 10^-4. Correct. The quadratic solution gave us pH ≈ 2.01. But option D is 1.76. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the quadratic solution. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nOriginal equation: x² + (3.0 × 10^-4)x - 9.99 × 10^-5 = 0.\n\nWait, the Ka is 3.0 × 10^-4. The initial concentration is 0.333 M. Therefore, the equation is x² / (0.333 - x) = 3.0 × 10^-4. So cross multiplying gives x² = 3.0 × 10^-4*(0.333 - x). Which is x² = 3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.333 - 3.0 × 10^-4 x. Which is x² = 9.99 × 10^-5 - 3.0 × 10^-4 x. Then bringing all terms to the left: x² + 3.0 × 10^-4 x - 9.99 × 10^-5 = 0. Correct.\n\nSo discriminant D is b² - 4ac. Wait, a is 1, b is 3.0 × 10^-4, c is -9.99 × 10^-5. So D = (3.0 × 10^-4)^2 - 4*(1)*(-9.99 × 10^-5) = 9.0 × 10^-8 + 3.996 × 10^-4 ≈ 3.996 × 10^-4 + 9.0 × 10^-8 ≈ 0.0003996 + 0.00000009 ≈ 0.00039969. So sqrt(D) is sqrt(0.00039969). Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLet me note that 0.02^2 = 0.0004. So sqrt(0.00039969) is very close to 0.02. Let me compute 0.02^2 = 0.0004. The difference between 0.0004 and 0.00039969 is 0.00000031. So we can approximate sqrt(0.00039969) as 0.02 - ε, where ε is small.\n\nLet me use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(x - δ) ≈ sqrt(x) - δ/(2 sqrt(x)).\n\nHere, x = 0.0004, δ = 0.00000031.\n\nsqrt(x - δ) ≈ sqrt(x) - δ/(2 sqrt(x)) = 0.02 - (0.00000031)/(2*0.02) = 0.02 - 0.00000031 / 0.04 ≈ 0.02 - 0.00000775 ≈ 0.01999225.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(D) ≈ 0.01999225.\n\nSo then x = [ -b + sqrt(D) ] / 2a = [ -3.0 × 10^-4 + 0.01999225 ] / 2.\n\nCalculating numerator: -0.0003 + 0.01999225 = 0.01969225.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.01969225 / 2 ≈ 0.009846125 M.\n\nSo [H+] ≈ 0.009846 M. Then pH = -log(0.009846).\n\nLet me calculate this more accurately. Let me use a calculator-like approach. Since I don't have a calculator, I need to estimate log(0.009846).\n\nFirst, note that 0.009846 is 9.846 × 10^-3. Let me recall that log(9.846 × 10^-3) = log(9.846) + log(10^-3) = log(9.846) - 3.\n\nAs before, log(9.846). Let me use more accurate approximation. Let me remember that log(9.846) is between log(9.8) ≈ 0.9912 and log(9.846). Let me use linear approximation between known points.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that log(9.846) = log(10 - 0.154). Maybe not helpful. Alternatively, use the Taylor series around log(10) = 1. Let me set x = 10 - 0.154 = 9.846. Let me write log(9.846) = log(10*(0.9846)) = log(10) + log(0.9846) = 1 + log(0.9846). Now, log(0.9846) can be approximated using the Taylor series for log(1 - ε) ≈ -ε - ε²/2 - ε³/3 - ... for small ε.\n\nHere, 0.9846 = 1 - 0.0154. So ε = 0.0154.\n\nThus, log(0.9846) ≈ -0.0154 - (0.0154)^2 / 2 - (0.0154)^3 / 3.\n\nFirst term: -0.0154\n\nSecond term: -(0.000237)/2 ≈ -0.0001185\n\nThird term: -(0.00000364)/3 ≈ -0.00000121\n\nAdding them together: -0.0154 - 0.0001185 - 0.00000121 ≈ -0.0155197.\n\nTherefore, log(9.846) ≈ 1 - 0.0155197 ≈ 0.98448. Wait, but earlier I thought it was around 0.993. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, log(9.846) is log(9.846 × 10^0). But earlier I said log(9.846) is approximated by log(10*(0.9846)) = 1 + log(0.9846). But actually, log(9.846) = log(9.846) directly. But if I want to express it in terms of log(10 - 0.154), that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I should use a better method.\n\nLet me use known values. For example, log(9.8) ≈ 0.9912, log(9.85) ?\n\nLet me recall that log(9.85) can be calculated as follows. Let me remember that log(9.85) is approximately?\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that log(9.846) = log(9.8 + 0.046). Let me use the derivative of log(x) at x=9.8. The derivative of log(x) is 1/x. So approximate log(9.8 + 0.046) ≈ log(9.8) + (0.046)/9.8.\n\nlog(9.8) ≈ 0.9912\n\n(0.046)/9.8 ≈ 0.00469\n\nTherefore, log(9.846) ≈ 0.9912 + 0.00469 ≈ 0.9959. Therefore, log(9.846 × 10^-3) ≈ 0.9959 - 3 = -2.0041, so pH ≈ 2.0041. So approximately 2.00. So that's about 2.00.\n\nBut earlier when I approximated using log(9.845) as 0.9932, I had pH ≈ 2.0068. Now with this method, I get pH ≈ 2.004. So both are around 2.00. So the pH is approximately 2.00. Therefore, the answer is B:2.\n\nBut why is option D:1.76 present? Maybe there was a miscalculation in the initial assumption? Let me check if I used the correct Ka value.\n\nThe problem states Ka is 3.0 × 10^-4. Correct. The initial concentration is 0.333 M. Correct. So the calculation seems right. Alternatively, maybe the student forgot to consider that the concentration is 0.333 M and did something else. Let me check if I messed up the initial concentration.\n\nOriginal problem: 0.1665 moles in 500 mL. 0.1665 / 0.5 L = 0.333 M. Correct. So that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution? Let me try plugging the value back into the Ka expression to check.\n\nIf [H+] = 0.009846 M, then [ClO-] = 0.009846 M, and [HClO] = 0.333 - 0.009846 ≈ 0.32315 M.\n\nThen Ka = (0.009846)^2 / 0.32315 ≈ (0.00009694) / 0.32315 ≈ 0.0003. Which is 3.0 × 10^-4. Exactly the given Ka. So the calculation checks out. Therefore, pH ≈ 2.00. So answer B:2 is correct.\n\nBut why is option D:1.76 present? Let me check if someone might have made a mistake by not using the quadratic equation and assuming x is 0.01, giving pH = 2, but maybe another approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the student forgot to divide by 2 in the quadratic solution? Let me see. If someone thought that x² ≈ 3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.333 ≈ 1 × 10^-4, then x ≈ 0.01, pH = 2. Which is correct. So why would someone get 1.76?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if they incorrectly used the concentration as 0.1665 M instead of 0.333 M? Let me check. If they thought the concentration was 0.1665 M instead of 0.333 M (because they forgot to divide by 0.5 L), then:\n\nKa = x² / (0.1665 - x) ≈ x² / 0.1665 = 3.0 × 10^-4 → x² ≈ 3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.1665 ≈ 5.0 × 10^-5 → x ≈ 7.07 × 10^-3 → pH ≈ -log(0.00707) ≈ 2.15. Still not 1.76.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the wrong formula? For example, if they thought that [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C), but then forgot to take the square root? For example, if they thought [H+] = Ka * C = 3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.333 ≈ 1 × 10^-4, then pH = 4. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the formula for a strong acid, assuming complete dissociation? If HClO were a strong acid, then [H+] = 0.333 M, pH = -log(0.333) ≈ 0.477. Not matching 1.76.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the Kb instead of Ka? But HClO is an acid, so Kb would be for its conjugate base, which is not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the wrong Ka value. If someone thought Ka was 3.0 × 10^-2 instead of 3.0 × 10^-4, then:\n\nKa = 0.03 = x² / 0.333 → x² ≈ 0.03 * 0.333 ≈ 0.01 → x ≈ 0.1, pH = 1. So that would give pH 1, which is option A. But the answer D is 1.76. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the formula for a diprotic acid or something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they did the calculation correctly but made an error in the log calculation. For example, if someone thought [H+] = 0.0176 M, then pH = 1.76. Let me see what [H+] would give that. 10^-1.76 ≈ 10^(-1.76). Let me approximate that. 10^-1.76 = 10^(-1 - 0.76) = 10^-1 * 10^-0.76. 10^-0.76 ≈ 10^(-0.76). Let me recall that 10^-0.7 ≈ 0.2, 10^-0.8 ≈ 0.158. Let me interpolate. Let me use the fact that log(0.174) ≈ -0.759. Because log(0.174) = log(1.74 × 10^-1) = log(1.74) + (-1). log(1.74) ≈ 0.2405, so total ≈ -0.7595. Therefore, 10^-0.76 ≈ 0.174. Therefore, 10^-1.76 ≈ 0.1 * 0.174 ≈ 0.0174 M. So if someone thought [H+] was 0.0174 M, then pH is 1.76. So why would they think [H+] is 0.0174?\n\nLet me check if there's a mistake in the quadratic solution. Suppose someone forgot to divide by 2 in the quadratic solution. Wait, x was calculated as [ -b + sqrt(D) ] / 2. If someone forgot to divide by 2, then x would be 0.01969 instead of 0.009845. Let me see what pH that would give.\n\nIf [H+] = 0.01969 M, then pH = -log(0.01969). Let's calculate that. log(0.01969) = log(1.969 × 10^-2) = log(1.969) + (-2). log(1.969) ≈ 0.294, so pH ≈ 0.294 - 2 = -1.706. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, pH = -log(0.01969) ≈ 1.706. Which is approximately 1.71, close to 1.76. So if someone forgot to divide by 2 in the quadratic solution, they would get x ≈ 0.01969, pH ≈ 1.71. Which is close to option D:1.76. Maybe due to rounding differences?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was an error in the quadratic solution steps. Let me check again.\n\nThe quadratic equation was x² + 3.0 × 10^-4 x - 9.99 × 10^-5 = 0.\n\nSolutions are x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a. With a = 1, b = 3.0 × 10^-4, c = -9.99 × 10^-5.\n\nSo sqrt(b² - 4ac) = sqrt( (3.0 × 10^-4)^2 + 4 * 9.99 × 10^-5 ) ≈ sqrt(9 × 10^-8 + 3.996 × 10^-4) ≈ sqrt(3.996 × 10^-4) ≈ 0.01999.\n\nThen x = [ -3.0 × 10^-4 + 0.01999 ] / 2 ≈ (0.01999 - 0.0003)/2 ≈ 0.01969 / 2 ≈ 0.009845. Correct. So if someone miscalculated and forgot to divide by 2, they would get x ≈ 0.01969, leading to pH ≈ 1.71. But the given option is 1.76, which is close but not exact. Maybe due to more precise calculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption that x is negligible was not made, but the student made an error in solving. Alternatively, perhaps the student used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation incorrectly?\n\nWait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is for buffers, which this is not. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the student used the formula for percent ionization. For example, if they calculated percent ionization as sqrt(Ka/C) * 100%? Wait, percent ionization is usually sqrt(Ka/C) * 100% for weak acids where Ka << C. Let's see, sqrt(3.0 × 10^-4 / 0.333) ≈ sqrt(9.0 × 10^-4) ≈ 0.03, so 3%. So [H+] = 0.333 * 0.03 ≈ 0.01 M. Which gives pH ≈ 2. So that's consistent with our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, if someone incorrectly used Ka = [H+]^2 / C, then [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C) = sqrt(3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.333) ≈ sqrt(1 × 10^-4) = 0.01, pH=2. So that's correct. So why would someone get 1.76?\n\nMaybe the student used the wrong concentration? For example, if they thought the concentration was 0.1 M instead of 0.333 M? Let's check: Ka = 3.0 × 10^-4 = x² / 0.1 → x = sqrt(3.0 × 10^-5) ≈ 0.00548, pH ≈ 2.26. Not 1.76.\n\nAlternatively, if they thought Ka was 1.8 × 10^-4 (like acetic acid), but no, the given Ka is 3.0 × 10^-4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they confused hypochlorous acid with another acid? No, the problem states HClO with Ka 3.0 × 10^-4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the student made a mistake in the calculation of the square root. For example, if they thought sqrt(3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.333) = sqrt(9.99 × 10^-5) ≈ 0.00999, but then incorrectly squared it again? No, that wouldn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the formula for a base? No, HClO is an acid.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that x is small. Let me check the exact value without approximation.\n\nWe found that [H+] ≈ 0.009845 M. Let me calculate the exact value of Ka using this:\n\nKa = (0.009845)^2 / (0.333 - 0.009845) ≈ (0.0000969) / 0.32315 ≈ 0.0003. Which is exactly 3.0 × 10^-4. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, pH ≈ 2.00.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer should be B:2. However, the options include D:1.76. Why is that? Maybe the given answer options are incorrect, or perhaps there was a miscalculation in the problem setup?\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the pH of a solution prepared by dissolving 0.1665 mole of hypochlorous acid (HClO) in enough water to make 500 mL of solution? The Ka is 3.0 × 10^-4\"\n\nYes, that's what was stated. So calculations are correct. So answer is B:2. However, maybe the question expects using the approximation without the quadratic, and maybe the given answer is different due to rounding? For example, if they used Ka = 3.0 × 10^-4 and C = 0.333 M, then x = sqrt(3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.333) ≈ sqrt(9.99 × 10^-5) ≈ 0.00999 M, pH = -log(0.00999) ≈ 2.00. So definitely answer B.\n\nBut why is option D present? Maybe the original problem had different numbers? For example, if the concentration was lower, say 0.01 M, then:\n\nKa = 3.0 × 10^-4 = x² / (0.01 - x). Assuming x is not negligible, solving quadratic:\n\nx² + 3.0 × 10^-4 x - 3.0 × 10^-6 = 0.\n\nDiscriminant D = (3.0 × 10^-4)^2 + 4 * 3.0 × 10^-6 = 9 × 10^-8 + 1.2 × 10^-5 ≈ 1.209 × 10^-5.\n\nsqrt(D) ≈ 0.003478.\n\nx = [ -3.0 × 10^-4 + 0.003478 ] / 2 ≈ 0.003178 / 2 ≈ 0.001589 M. pH ≈ 2.8. Still not 1.76.\n\nAlternatively, if the concentration was higher, say 1 M:\n\nKa = 3.0 × 10^-4 = x² / (1 - x). Assuming x is small: x ≈ sqrt(3.0 × 10^-4 * 1) ≈ 0.0173 M. pH ≈ 1.76. Ah! There we go. So if the concentration was 1 M instead of 0.333 M, then pH would be about 1.76. So perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement where the concentration was supposed to be 1 M, but it's given as 0.333 M here. Or maybe I made a mistake in calculating the concentration.\n\nWait, the problem says 0.1665 moles in 500 mL. 0.1665 / 0.5 L = 0.333 M. Correct. But if the problem had said, for example, 0.1665 grams instead of moles, that would be different. But the problem says moles. So calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the student used grams instead of moles? For example, if they thought 0.1665 grams of HClO, but that would be a different calculation. Let's check:\n\nMolar mass of HClO: H is 1, Cl is 35.45, O is 16. Total ≈ 52.45 g/mol.\n\n0.1665 grams / 52.45 g/mol ≈ 0.003176 moles. In 0.5 L, concentration ≈ 0.00635 M. Then Ka = 3.0 × 10^-4 = x² / 0.00635. x² = 3.0 × 10^-4 * 0.00635 ≈ 1.9 × 10^-6. x ≈ 0.00138 M. pH ≈ 2.86. Still not 1.76.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B:2. Perhaps option D is a distractor for a different problem or a miscalculation. Given that my calculations repeatedly show pH ≈ 2.00, I will go with answer B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
