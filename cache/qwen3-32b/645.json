The electron can't penetrate the conductor's surface. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a charge is near a conductor, there's an image charge effect. For a grounded conducting plane, the image charge is a mirror image with opposite sign. Since the electron is negatively charged, the image charge would be positive and located symmetrically on the other side of the plane. This image charge creates an attractive force on the electron, effectively creating a potential well that confines the electron above the conductor. \n\nSo maybe I can model this system as an electron in a potential due to its own image charge. The problem is similar to an electron in a one-dimensional potential well, but not exactly infinite because the potential isn't infinite at the surface. Wait, the conductor is grounded, so the potential there is zero. But the electron is confined above the surface. Let me recall the image charge method.\n\nIf the electron is at position z above the plane, the image charge is at -z. The potential energy of the electron due to the image charge can be calculated. The electric field from the image charge would create a potential that the electron experiences. Since the electron can't penetrate the conductor, z can't be negative. So the problem becomes a quantum mechanical problem of a particle in a potential well created by the image charge.\n\nLet me write down the potential energy. The image charge method for a point charge near a grounded conductor replaces the conductor with an image charge. The potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law. But here, the electron and its image are separated by a distance of 2z. So the potential energy U(z) should be:\n\nU(z) = - (e^2)/(4πε₀ * 2z)\n\nWait, the potential energy between two charges is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r. Here, q1 is -e, q2 is +e (image charge), and r is 2z. So the potential energy is (1/(4πε₀)) * (-e)(e)/(2z) = - e²/(8πε₀ z). Wait, no, 4πε₀ in the denominator? Let me check the formula again. The Coulomb potential energy is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r. So here, q1 = -e, q2 = +e, r = 2z. Therefore:\n\nU(z) = [1/(4πε₀)] * [(-e)(+e)]/(2z) = - e²/(8πε₀ z * 4πε₀)? Wait no, let me recast. Let me compute:\n\nU = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r. Here, q1 = -e, q2 = +e, r = 2z. Therefore:\n\nU = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-e^2)/(2z) = - e²/(8πε₀ z). Yes, that's correct. So the potential energy is negative and proportional to -1/z. \n\nTherefore, the electron is in a potential U(z) = - k / z, where k = e²/(8πε₀). However, since the electron can't penetrate the conductor, the boundary condition is that the wavefunction must be zero at z=0. So this is similar to a quantum mechanical problem of a particle in a potential -k/z with a boundary condition at z=0. \n\nBut wait, the potential -k/z is similar to the Coulomb potential in the hydrogen atom, but in one dimension? Or is it in three dimensions? Wait, the electron is moving above the conducting plane. Since the plane is infinite, the motion in the plane (x and y directions) is free, right? Because the potential doesn't depend on x and y. So the problem is separable into motion parallel to the plane and motion perpendicular to the plane. \n\nTherefore, the total wavefunction can be separated into ψ(x, y, z) = ϕ(x,y) * χ(z). The potential energy only depends on z, so the Schrödinger equation can be separated. The energy will be the sum of the energies from the two parts. \n\nFor the motion in x and y directions, since there is no potential (the potential is only in z), the electron is free to move in those directions. However, since we are looking for the ground state, we need the lowest energy state. In the ground state, the momentum in x and y directions would be zero? Wait, no. In quantum mechanics, even in free space, the lowest energy state would be zero, but since there's no confinement, the wavefunction would be spread out. However, since the problem is about the average distance from the conductor, which only depends on z, maybe the x and y parts don't affect the average z. Therefore, perhaps we can focus only on the z part of the wavefunction. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to solving the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a particle in a potential U(z) = -k/z with a boundary condition χ(0) = 0. \n\nBut wait, the potential -k/z is similar to the Coulomb potential, but in one dimension? Wait, in three dimensions, the Coulomb potential is -k/r, and we solve the hydrogen atom. But here, we have a one-dimensional problem? Or is it effectively two-dimensional? Wait, no. The motion in x and y is free, so the problem for z is one-dimensional. So the Schrödinger equation for χ(z) is:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * d²χ/dz² + U(z) * χ(z) = E χ(z)\n\nWith U(z) = -k/z, and χ(0) = 0.\n\nBut the Coulomb potential in three dimensions is -k/r, and we have bound states. Here, in one dimension, with potential -k/z, does a bound state exist? Let me think. \n\nIn one dimension, the potential -k/z for z > 0. But z is a coordinate, so it's like a one-dimensional potential that goes as -1/z. However, in one dimension, the Coulomb potential behaves differently. Let me recall that in one dimension, the potential between two charges would actually be different. Wait, but here we are using the image charge method, which is derived from three-dimensional electrostatics. So the potential energy of the electron is calculated in 3D, but the motion is constrained to z > 0, while x and y are free. So the effective potential for z is -k/z, but the Schrödinger equation is in one dimension for z. \n\nTherefore, we need to solve the 1D Schrödinger equation with potential -k/z and boundary condition at z=0. Let me check if such a potential can have bound states. \n\nIn one dimension, for a potential that goes to zero at infinity and is attractive, there are always bound states. For example, even a shallow potential well in 1D has at least one bound state. However, the potential here is -k/z, which is singular at z=0. But we have a boundary condition that χ(0) = 0. So perhaps we can find the ground state wavefunction and then compute the expectation value of z.\n\nBut how do we solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential? Let me write it down:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * χ''(z) - (k/z) χ(z) = E χ(z)\n\nWith χ(0) = 0.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nχ''(z) + [2m/ħ² (E + k/(z))] χ(z) = 0.\n\nThis looks similar to the radial equation for the hydrogen atom, but in 1D. However, the hydrogen atom equation in 3D is in terms of r, with effective potential involving 1/r and angular momentum terms. Here, in 1D, there is no angular momentum term, and the potential is -k/z. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution to relate this equation to a known differential equation. Let me consider changing variables. Let me set u(z) = z χ(z), to account for the boundary condition at z=0. Because if χ(0) = 0, then u(0) = 0 * χ(0) = 0, but maybe this substitution helps in simplifying the equation. Let me try.\n\nLet u(z) = z χ(z). Then χ(z) = u(z)/z. Let me compute the derivatives:\n\nFirst derivative: χ'(z) = [u'(z) z - u(z)] / z²\n\nSecond derivative: χ''(z) = [u''(z) z² - 2 u'(z) z + 2 u(z)] / z³\n\nPlugging into the Schrödinger equation:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * [u''(z) z² - 2 u'(z) z + 2 u(z)] / z³ - k/z * u(z)/z = E u(z)/z\n\nMultiply both sides by z³ / ħ² to simplify:\n\n- (1/(2m)) [u'' z² - 2 u' z + 2 u] - k z / ħ² * u = E z² / ħ² * u\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe there is another substitution. Alternatively, perhaps I can compare this equation to the equation for the hydrogen atom. \n\nIn the hydrogen atom, the radial equation is:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r²) d/dr (r² dR/dr) ] - (e²/(4πε₀ r)) R(r) = E R(r)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (d²R/dr²) + (2/r) dR/dr ] - (k'/r) R = E R\n\nWhere k' = e²/(4πε₀). \n\nComparing this with our equation for χ(z):\n\nχ''(z) + [2m/ħ² (E + k/z)] χ(z) = 0\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nχ''(z) + [ (2m E)/ħ² + (2m k)/(ħ² z) ] χ(z) = 0\n\nBut in the hydrogen atom equation, the radial equation has terms with 1/r² derivatives and 1/r terms. However, if we consider the substitution for the radial equation, if we set u(r) = r R(r), then the equation becomes:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) u''(r) - (k'/r) u(r) = E u(r)\n\nWhich is similar to our equation here. So in our case, if we set u(z) = z χ(z), then maybe we can get a similar equation. Let me try again.\n\nLet u(z) = z χ(z). Then χ(z) = u(z)/z.\n\nCompute χ''(z):\n\nFirst derivative:\n\nχ'(z) = [u'(z) z - u(z)] / z²\n\nSecond derivative:\n\nχ''(z) = [u''(z) z² - 2 u'(z) z + 2 u(z)] / z³\n\nSo plug into the Schrödinger equation:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * [u''(z) z² - 2 u'(z) z + 2 u(z)] / z³ - k/z * u(z)/z = E u(z)/z\n\nMultiply both sides by z³ / ħ²:\n\n- (1/(2m)) [u'' z² - 2 u' z + 2 u] - (k z / ħ²) u = (E z³ / ħ²) u / z ?\n\nWait, let me do it step by step. Starting from:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * χ''(z) - (k/z) χ(z) = E χ(z)\n\nSubstitute χ''(z) and χ(z):\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * [u''(z) z² - 2 u'(z) z + 2 u(z)] / z³ - (k/z) * [u(z)/z] = E [u(z)/z]\n\nMultiply all terms by z³ / ħ²:\n\n- (1/(2m)) [u'' z² - 2 u' z + 2 u] - (k z² / (ħ²)) [u(z)/z²] = (E z³ / ħ²) [u(z)/z]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: - (1/(2m)) [u'' z² - 2 u' z + 2 u]\n\nSecond term: - (k / ħ²) u(z)\n\nThird term: (E z² / ħ²) u(z)\n\nSo combining:\n\n- (1/(2m)) [u'' z² - 2 u' z + 2 u] - (k / ħ²) u(z) - (E z² / ħ²) u(z) = 0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the left side after multiplying by z³ / ħ² is equal to the right side multiplied by same factor. The original equation was:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * χ''(z) - (k/z) χ(z) = E χ(z)\n\nMultiply both sides by z³ / ħ²:\n\nLeft side:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * χ''(z) * z³ / ħ² - (k/z) χ(z) * z³ / ħ² \n\n= - (z³ / 2m) χ''(z) - (k z² / ħ²) χ(z)\n\nRight side:\n\nE χ(z) * z³ / ħ² \n\nTherefore, substituting χ''(z) and χ(z):\n\n- (z³ / 2m) [ (u'' z² - 2 u' z + 2 u)/z³ ] - (k z² / ħ²) [ u(z)/z ] = E [u(z)/z ] * z³ / ħ² \n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term:\n\n- (1/(2m)) [u'' z² - 2 u' z + 2 u]\n\nSecond term:\n\n- (k z / ħ²) u(z)\n\nThird term:\n\nE z² / ħ² * u(z)\n\nTherefore, bringing all terms to left:\n\n- (1/(2m)) [u'' z² - 2 u' z + 2 u] - (k z / ħ²) u(z) - E z² / ħ² * u(z) = 0 \n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I need to rearrange terms. Let me divide through by z²? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for variables to make the equation dimensionless.\n\nLet me define dimensionless variables. Let me set ζ = α z, where α is some constant to be determined. Let me also define energy in terms of some reference energy. Let me think about the hydrogen atom analogy. In the hydrogen atom, the ground state energy is -13.6 eV, and the Bohr radius is a₀ = 4πε₀ ħ²/(m e²). \n\nBut here, our potential is -k/z, with k = e²/(8πε₀). Let me write k in terms of the Coulomb constant. Let me recall that the Coulomb potential between two charges is usually written as (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r. In our case, the potential energy is - e²/(8πε₀ z), which can be written as - (1/(4πε₀)) * (e²/2)/z. So it's similar to a Coulomb potential with effective charge e/√2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about scaling. Let me define a length scale a and energy scale E₀ such that the equation becomes dimensionless. Let me set z = a ζ, and E = E₀ ε. Then substituting into the equation:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * χ''(z) - (k/z) χ(z) = E χ(z)\n\nLet me compute derivatives:\n\ndz = a dζ, so d/dz = (1/a) d/dζ, and d²/dz² = (1/a²) d²/dζ².\n\nSubstituting:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * (1/a²) χ''(ζ) - (k/(a ζ)) χ(ζ) = E₀ ε χ(ζ)\n\nMultiply through by -2m a² / ħ²:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ (2m k a ) / ( ħ² ζ ) + (2m E₀ a² / ħ² ) ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nWe want to choose a and E₀ such that the coefficients become constants. Let me set:\n\n(2m k a ) / ħ² = 1/ζ ?\n\nWait, no. Let me set the coefficient of 1/ζ to be a constant, say 1/ζ? Wait, maybe I want to have terms like -1/ζ and ε. Let me choose a and E₀ so that:\n\n(2m k a ) / ħ² = 1 \n\nand \n\n(2m E₀ a² ) / ħ² ) = - something. \n\nLet me set the coefficient of 1/ζ to be 1. So:\n\n(2m k a ) / ħ² = 1 => a = ħ² / (2m k )\n\nSimilarly, for the energy term, let me set E₀ = - ( ħ² ) / (2m a² ). Let me compute E₀:\n\nE₀ = - ħ² / (2m a² ) = - ħ² / [ 2m ( ħ^4 / (4 m² k² ) ) ] = - ħ² * 4 m² k² / (2m ħ^4 ) ) = - 2 m k² / ħ² \n\nTherefore, substituting back, the equation becomes:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ 1/ζ - ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nWait, let me check:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ (2m k a ) / ( ħ² ζ ) + (2m E₀ a² / ħ² ) ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nWith (2m k a ) / ħ² = 1 and (2m E₀ a² ) / ħ² ) = ?\n\nFrom E₀ = - ħ² / (2m a² ), then:\n\n(2m E₀ a² ) / ħ² ) = 2m * [ - ħ² / (2m a² ) ] * a² / ħ² ) = -1 \n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ 1/ζ - ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nWait, but χ(ζ) is u(ζ)/ζ? Or is it χ(z)? Wait, no, we did substitution z = a ζ, and we are working with χ(z), but we also had earlier substitution u(z) = z χ(z). Maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nActually, in this substitution, we are just scaling variables. Let me recap:\n\nWe have transformed the Schrödinger equation into a dimensionless form:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ 1/ζ - ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nBut this equation is similar to the radial equation for the hydrogen atom in 3D? Wait, no. In the hydrogen atom, after substitution u(r) = r R(r), the equation becomes:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) u''(r) - (k'/r) u(r) = E u(r)\n\nWhich, after scaling, becomes similar to:\n\nu''(r) + [ (2m k' / ħ² ) / r - (2m E / ħ² ) ] u(r) = 0 \n\nWhich is similar to our equation here, but with different coefficients. However, in our case, the equation is:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ 1/ζ - ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nThis is the same as the equation for the hydrogen atom if we set ζ = r and ε = something. However, in the hydrogen atom equation, there is also a term involving angular momentum. But here, there is no such term. \n\nThis equation is actually the same as the 1D Schrödinger equation for a Coulomb potential. Wait, but in 1D, the solutions might be different. However, I recall that the equation:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ 1/ζ - ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nIs similar to the modified Bessel equation or something else? Alternatively, perhaps we can recognize this as the equation for the Airy function? No, the Airy equation is y'' - xy = 0. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for bound states, ε is positive? Wait, our energy E is negative for bound states. Since E = E₀ ε, and E₀ was defined as negative. Let me check:\n\nEarlier, we set E₀ = - ħ² / (2m a² ). So if E is negative, then ε = E / E₀ would be positive. Therefore, the equation is:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ 1/ζ - ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nWith ε positive. \n\nThis equation is similar to the equation for the hydrogen atom, but without the angular momentum barrier. In the hydrogen atom, the effective potential includes a term from angular momentum, but here, there is no such term. Therefore, the solutions might be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can make another substitution. Let me consider ζ = 1/ρ or something. Alternatively, let me try to look for solutions in terms of known functions. Let me assume that for bound states, ε is a positive constant. \n\nLet me try to look for asymptotic behavior. For large ζ, the equation becomes:\n\nχ''(ζ) - ε χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nWhich has solutions exp(±√ε ζ). Since we want bound states, which are normalizable, we need χ(ζ) to go to zero as ζ → ∞. Therefore, we take the solution exp(-√ε ζ). \n\nFor small ζ, the equation is approximately:\n\nχ''(ζ) + (1/ζ) χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nLet me assume a solution of the form χ(ζ) ~ ζ^s. Then:\n\ns(s-1) ζ^{s-2} + (1/ζ) ζ^s = 0 \n\n=> s(s-1) ζ^{s-2} + ζ^{s-2} = 0 \n\n=> [s(s-1) + 1] ζ^{s-2} = 0 \n\nTherefore:\n\ns(s - 1) + 1 = 0 => s² - s + 1 = 0 \n\nSolutions:\n\ns = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4)] / 2 = [1 ± i√3]/2 \n\nComplex exponents. Therefore, the solution near ζ = 0 is oscillatory. However, we also have the boundary condition that χ(0) = 0. Since our substitution was u(z) = z χ(z), and χ(z) = u(z)/z, but if we have u(z) = z χ(z), then u(0) = 0, which is already satisfied. However, the original boundary condition is χ(0) = 0. Wait, but if we have χ(z) ~ ζ^{s} near zero, with complex exponents, then perhaps we need to take a combination that gives real solutions? This seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a better approach. Let me recall that the problem is analogous to the hydrogen atom but in 1D with a different potential. However, in 1D, the Coulomb potential -1/z may not have discrete energy levels? Or does it?\n\nWait, in general, for a potential that is attractive and goes to zero at infinity, in one dimension, there are infinitely many bound states. However, for the specific case of -1/z potential, which is singular at z=0, perhaps the solutions are different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a variational method to estimate the ground state energy and then find the average distance. Since solving the differential equation analytically seems difficult. \n\nBut since the problem asks for the average distance in the ground state, maybe there is a known solution or an analogy with the hydrogen atom. Let me think again about the hydrogen atom. \n\nIn the hydrogen atom, the ground state energy is E = - me^4/(8ε₀²h²), and the Bohr radius is a₀ = 4πε₀h²/(me²). But here, our potential is -k/z, where k = e²/(8πε₀). Let me write k = e²/(8πε₀) = (e²/(4πε₀)) * 1/(2). Therefore, it's half of the usual Coulomb potential. \n\nIf I compare this to the hydrogen atom, where the potential is - (e²/(4πε₀))/r. So if I imagine a particle with charge e interacting with a charge -e/2? Not sure. Alternatively, think of it as a scaled hydrogen atom. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that our effective potential is -k/z = - (e²/(8πε₀))/z. Let me define a new effective charge, say e' such that e'²/(4πε₀) = e²/(8πε₀), which would imply e' = e/√2. So the potential is equivalent to a Coulomb potential between charges e and -e/√2. But I don't know if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about the hydrogen atom solution. The ground state wavefunction is ψ(r) ∝ e^{-r/a₀}, with a₀ the Bohr radius. The expectation value ⟨r⟩ is 3a₀/2. But in our case, if we have a similar solution, maybe ⟨z⟩ can be found similarly. \n\nBut to do that, I need to find the analogous Bohr radius for our problem. Let me try to find the length scale. \n\nIn the hydrogen atom, the Bohr radius is a₀ = 4πε₀ħ²/(m e²). In our case, the potential is -k/z = - e²/(8πε₀ z). Let me find the length scale a for our problem. \n\nAssuming that the Schrödinger equation has a similar form, the length scale would be determined by balancing the kinetic and potential energy. In the variational approach, let's assume a trial wavefunction χ(z) = A e^{-z/a}, with a to be determined. \n\nThe kinetic energy is ⟨T⟩ = - (ħ²/(2m)) ∫ χ(z)'' χ(z) dz. Let's compute:\n\nχ''(z) = A/a² e^{-z/a}\n\nTherefore, ⟨T⟩ = - (ħ²/(2m)) ∫ [A/a² e^{-z/a}] [A e^{-z/a}] dz \n\n= - (ħ² A² / (2m a²)) ∫ e^{-2z/a} dz \n\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-2z/a} dz = a/2 \n\nTherefore, ⟨T⟩ = - (ħ² A² / (2m a²)) * (a/2) = - ħ² A² / (4m a) \n\nBut since the wavefunction must be normalized:\n\n∫₀^∞ |χ(z)|² dz = A² ∫₀^∞ e^{-2z/a} dz = A² (a/2) = 1 => A² = 2/a \n\nTherefore, ⟨T⟩ = - ħ² (2/a) / (4m a) ) = - ħ² / (2m a² )\n\nThe potential energy ⟨U⟩ = ∫₀^∞ [ -k/z ] |χ(z)|² dz \n\n= -k A² ∫₀^∞ e^{-2z/a} / z dz \n\nBut this integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-2z/a} / z dz is divergent at z=0. Oh no, that's a problem. The trial wavefunction leads to a divergent potential energy integral. Therefore, this trial wavefunction is not suitable because it doesn't account for the singularity at z=0. \n\nTherefore, maybe we need a trial wavefunction that goes to zero faster near z=0. For example, maybe χ(z) = A z e^{-z/a}, since we know that the wavefunction must be zero at z=0. \n\nLet me try that. Let χ(z) = A z e^{-z/a}. Then normalize it:\n\n∫₀^∞ |χ(z)|² dz = A² ∫₀^∞ z² e^{-2z/a} dz \n\nLet me compute this integral. Let me set y = 2z/a => z = (a/2)y, dz = (a/2) dy. Then:\n\n∫₀^∞ z² e^{-2z/a} dz = (a/2)³ ∫₀^∞ y² e^{-y} dy = (a³ / 8) Γ(3) = (a³ / 8) * 2! = (a³ / 8) * 2 = a³ / 4 \n\nTherefore, normalization: A² * a³ / 4 = 1 => A = 2 / a^{3/2}\n\nNow compute ⟨T⟩:\n\nFirst, compute χ''(z). \n\nχ(z) = A z e^{-z/a}\n\nFirst derivative: χ'(z) = A [ e^{-z/a} - z/a e^{-z/a} ] = A e^{-z/a} (1 - z/a )\n\nSecond derivative: χ''(z) = A e^{-z/a} [ ( -1/a )(1 - z/a ) - 1/a ] \n\n= A e^{-z/a} [ - (1/a - z/a² ) - 1/a ] \n\n= A e^{-z/a} [ -1/a + z/a² - 1/a ] \n\n= A e^{-z/a} [ -2/a + z/a² ] \n\nTherefore, ⟨T⟩ = - (ħ²/(2m)) ∫ χ''(z) χ(z) dz \n\n= - (ħ²/(2m)) ∫ [A e^{-z/a} ( -2/a + z/a² ) ] [A z e^{-z/a} ] dz \n\n= - (ħ² A² / (2m)) ∫ e^{-2z/a} z ( -2/a + z/a² ) dz \n\n= (ħ² A² / (2m)) [ (2/a) ∫ z e^{-2z/a} dz - (1/a²) ∫ z² e^{-2z/a} dz ] \n\nCompute the integrals:\n\nFirst integral: ∫ z e^{-2z/a} dz from 0 to ∞. Let me substitute y = 2z/a, z = a y / 2, dz = a/2 dy. Then:\n\n∫₀^∞ z e^{-2z/a} dz = (a/2)^2 ∫₀^∞ y e^{-y} dy = (a² / 4) Γ(2) = (a² / 4)(1!) = a² / 4\n\nSecond integral: ∫ z² e^{-2z/a} dz from 0 to ∞ = a³ / 4 as before.\n\nTherefore:\n\n⟨T⟩ = (ħ² A² / (2m)) [ (2/a)(a² / 4) - (1/a²)(a³ / 4) ] \n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term inside brackets: (2/a)(a² / 4) = a/2 \n\nSecond term: -(1/a²)(a³ / 4) = -a/4 \n\nTotal inside brackets: a/2 - a/4 = a/4 \n\nTherefore:\n\n⟨T⟩ = (ħ² A² / (2m)) * (a/4) \n\nBut A² = 4 / a³ (since A = 2 / a^{3/2}, so A² = 4 / a³ )\n\nTherefore:\n\n⟨T⟩ = (ħ² / (2m)) * (4 / a³) * (a / 4) ) = (ħ² / (2m)) * (1 / a² ) \n\nSo ⟨T⟩ = ħ² / (2m a² )\n\nWait, positive? But kinetic energy should be positive, yes. Because the expectation value of kinetic energy is positive. Earlier, I had a negative sign because of the integration by parts? Wait, in the calculation above, I think I might have messed up the signs. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal expression for ⟨T⟩ was:\n\n⟨T⟩ = - (ħ²/(2m)) ∫ χ''(z) χ(z) dz \n\nBut χ''(z) is [ -2/a + z/a² ] A e^{-z/a} \n\nTherefore, when I plug into the integral, it becomes:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) * [ ... ] \n\nBut after calculating, I ended up with a positive value. Let me verify the calculation again. \n\nThe integral became:\n\n(ħ² A² / (2m)) [ (2/a)(a² / 4) - (1/a²)(a³ / 4) ] \n\nWhich is (ħ² A² / (2m)) * [ a/2 - a/4 ] = (ħ² A² / (2m)) * a/4 \n\nYes, and since A² = 4 / a³, then:\n\n(ħ² / (2m)) * (4 / a³) * (a / 4) ) = (ħ² / (2m)) * (1 / a² )\n\nYes, correct. So ⟨T⟩ = ħ² / (2m a² )\n\nNow compute ⟨U⟩:\n\n⟨U⟩ = ∫₀^∞ [ -k/z ] |χ(z)|² dz \n\n= -k A² ∫₀^∞ z e^{-2z/a} dz \n\nWait, because |χ(z)|² = A² z² e^{-2z/a}, so ⟨U⟩ = -k A² ∫₀^∞ z e^{-2z/a} dz \n\nWait, no! Wait, |χ(z)|² is A² z² e^{-2z/a}, so:\n\n⟨U⟩ = -k ∫₀^∞ [A² z² e^{-2z/a} ] / z dz = -k A² ∫₀^∞ z e^{-2z/a} dz \n\nWhich is finite now! Because the z in the denominator from U(z) = -k/z cancels with one power of z from |χ(z)|². \n\nSo, ⟨U⟩ = -k A² * [a² / 4] \n\nWait, earlier we had ∫ z e^{-2z/a} dz = a² / 4 \n\nYes. Therefore:\n\n⟨U⟩ = -k A² (a² / 4 )\n\nWith A² = 4 / a³:\n\n⟨U⟩ = -k * (4 / a³) * (a² / 4 ) = -k / a \n\nTherefore, the total energy ⟨E⟩ = ⟨T⟩ + ⟨U⟩ = ħ²/(2m a² ) - k / a \n\nNow, to find the minimum energy, take derivative of ⟨E⟩ with respect to a and set to zero:\n\nd⟨E⟩/da = - ħ²/(m a³ ) + k / a² = 0 \n\n=> - ħ²/(m a³ ) + k / a² = 0 \n\nMultiply through by a³:\n\n- ħ²/m + k a = 0 => a = ( ħ² ) / (m k )\n\nTherefore, the optimal a is a = ħ²/(m k )\n\nThen, the minimum energy is:\n\n⟨E⟩ = ħ²/(2m a² ) - k / a \n\nSubstitute a = ħ²/(m k ):\n\n⟨E⟩ = ħ²/(2m ( ħ^4 / m² k² )) - k / ( ħ²/(m k )) \n\nSimplify first term:\n\n= ( ħ² m² k² ) / ( 2m ħ^4 ) ) = ( m k² ) / ( 2 ħ² )\n\nSecond term:\n\n- k * (m k ) / ħ² = - m k² / ħ² \n\nTherefore, total ⟨E⟩ = (m k² / 2 ħ² ) - (m k² / ħ² ) = - m k² / (2 ħ² )\n\nSo the ground state energy is - m k² / (2 ħ² )\n\nNow, we can find the average distance ⟨z⟩ using our trial wavefunction χ(z) = A z e^{-z/a} with a = ħ²/(m k )\n\n⟨z⟩ = ∫₀^∞ z |χ(z)|² dz = A² ∫₀^∞ z³ e^{-2z/a} dz \n\nLet me compute this integral. Again, substitute y = 2z/a => z = a y / 2, dz = a/2 dy \n\n∫₀^∞ z³ e^{-2z/a} dz = (a/2)^4 ∫₀^∞ y³ e^{-y} dy = (a^4 / 16) Γ(4) = (a^4 / 16)(6) = (3 a^4)/8 \n\nTherefore:\n\n⟨z⟩ = A² * 3 a^4 / 8 \n\nBut A² = 4 / a³ \n\nThus:\n\n⟨z⟩ = (4 / a³ ) * (3 a^4 / 8 ) = (12 a / 8 ) = (3 a ) / 2 \n\nTherefore, ⟨z⟩ = (3/2) a \n\nSince a = ħ²/(m k ), then:\n\n⟨z⟩ = (3/2) * ħ²/(m k )\n\nNow substitute k = e²/(8 π ε₀ )\n\n⟨z⟩ = (3/2) * ħ² / [ m * e²/(8 π ε₀ ) ] = (3/2) * 8 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ) \n\nSimplify:\n\n= 12 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² )\n\nWait, let me compute 3/2 * 8 π = 12 π. Yes.\n\nBut let me recall the Bohr radius a₀ = 4 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ). Therefore, ⟨z⟩ = 3 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ) * 4 = 3 a₀ / 2 * ?\n\nWait, let me express ⟨z⟩ in terms of a₀. Since a₀ = 4 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e² ), then:\n\n⟨z⟩ = (12 π ε₀ ħ² ) / (m e² ) = 3 * [4 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ) ] = 3 a₀ \n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, ⟨z⟩ = 12 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ) \n\nBut a₀ = 4 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² )\n\nTherefore, ⟨z⟩ = 3 * a₀ \n\nWait, 12 / 4 = 3. Yes. Therefore, ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀ \n\nBut wait, in the hydrogen atom, the expectation value ⟨r⟩ for the ground state is 3 a₀ / 2. Here, we get ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀. Is this a discrepancy? \n\nBut in our case, the potential is different. Remember that our k = e²/(8 π ε₀ ), whereas in the hydrogen atom, the Coulomb potential is - e²/(4 π ε₀ r ). So if we consider that our effective potential is -k/z = - e²/(8 π ε₀ z ), which is half as strong as the hydrogen atom potential. Therefore, the length scale here would be different. \n\nBut we derived ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀, where a₀ is the Bohr radius. But let me check the calculation again. \n\nWe found that a = ħ²/(m k ). With k = e²/(8 π ε₀ ), so:\n\na = ħ² / [ m * e²/(8 π ε₀ ) ] = 8 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ) \n\nBut the Bohr radius is a₀ = 4 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e² ), so a = 2 a₀. \n\nThen ⟨z⟩ = (3/2) a = (3/2)(2 a₀ ) = 3 a₀ \n\nYes. So the average distance is three times the Bohr radius. \n\nBut wait, is this correct? In our variational calculation, using a trial wavefunction χ(z) = A z e^{-z/a}, we found ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀. However, this is based on a variational method with a specific trial wavefunction. But is this the exact result?\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the Schrödinger equation we derived earlier, after scaling, became:\n\nχ''(ζ) + [ 1/ζ - ε ] χ(ζ) = 0 \n\nWith χ(0) = 0. If we assume that the solution is similar to the hydrogen atom, but with different boundary conditions, maybe there is an exact solution. \n\nBut given that our variational method gave ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀, and given that the trial wavefunction was similar to the hydrogen atom ground state (which is ψ ∝ r e^{-r/a₀} ), but in 1D, maybe this is the exact solution? \n\nAlternatively, let me think about the hydrogen atom solution. In the hydrogen atom, the radial wavefunction for the ground state is R(r) ∝ e^{-r/a₀}, and u(r) = r R(r) ∝ r e^{-r/a₀}. The expectation value ⟨r⟩ is 3 a₀ / 2. \n\nIn our case, the trial wavefunction was χ(z) = A z e^{-z/a}, which is similar to u(r) in hydrogen atom. However, our length scale a is 2 a₀, so substituting, ⟨z⟩ = 3/2 * a = 3/2 * 2 a₀ = 3 a₀. \n\nTherefore, it seems that the variational method gives ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀. But since we used a trial wavefunction that is similar to the exact solution of the hydrogen atom, and given that the differential equation is similar, it's plausible that this is the exact result. \n\nTherefore, the average distance between the electron and the conductor's surface is ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀, where a₀ is the Bohr radius. \n\nBut let me check units. The Bohr radius has units of length, so yes, ⟨z⟩ is in length. \n\nBut wait, let me write down the expression again. \n\n⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀ = 3 * (4 π ε₀ ħ² ) / (m e² )\n\nBut in our case, the potential was U(z) = - e²/(8 π ε₀ z ). Therefore, the Bohr radius here might be different. Wait, earlier I defined a₀ as the standard Bohr radius, but actually, in our problem, the effective potential is different, so the length scale is different. \n\nWait, in our calculation, we found that the optimal a is a = ħ²/(m k ), with k = e²/(8 π ε₀ ). Therefore:\n\na = ħ² / [ m * e²/(8 π ε₀ ) ] = 8 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ) \n\nWhich is twice the standard Bohr radius a₀ = 4 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e² ). Therefore, a = 2 a₀ \n\nThen ⟨z⟩ = 3/2 * a = 3/2 * 2 a₀ = 3 a₀ \n\nSo yes, the average distance is three times the Bohr radius. \n\nBut the question is about an electron above a grounded conductor. Is there a standard result for this? I think this problem is analogous to the image charge problem, and the average distance would be related to the image charge potential. Therefore, the average distance is ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀, where a₀ is the Bohr radius. \n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. The Bohr radius is approximately 0.529 angstroms. If the average distance is three times that, it would be about 1.587 angstroms. However, I need to make sure that the Bohr radius here is correctly defined for this problem. \n\nAlternatively, let me express ⟨z⟩ in terms of the given constants without referencing the Bohr radius. \n\nFrom above:\n\n⟨z⟩ = 3 * (8 π ε₀ ħ² ) / (2 m e² )? Wait no. Wait, ⟨z⟩ = 3 a, and a = 8 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ). Wait no:\n\nWait, ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀', where a₀' is the length scale for this problem, which is a = 8 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ). Therefore:\n\n⟨z⟩ = 3 * [ 8 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ) ] \n\nBut wait, no. Earlier we had:\n\n⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀, where a₀ = 4 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e² ). Wait no, in this problem, the length scale a is 8 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e² ), which is twice the standard Bohr radius. Therefore:\n\n⟨z⟩ = 3 a / 2 * 2? Wait, no. Earlier calculation said ⟨z⟩ = (3/2) a, where a = 8 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e² ). Therefore:\n\n⟨z⟩ = (3/2) * [ 8 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² ) ] = 12 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² )\n\nBut the standard Bohr radius is a₀ = 4 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e² ), so ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀. \n\nTherefore, the answer is ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀. \n\nBut let me check if this makes sense. The image charge creates a potential that confines the electron, similar to the Coulomb attraction in the hydrogen atom. However, since the potential is half as strong (because k = e²/(8 π ε₀ ) instead of e²/(4 π ε₀ )), the length scale is doubled. Then, the average distance is three times the Bohr radius. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the hydrogen atom ground state ⟨r⟩ = 3 a₀ / 2, then in our case, since the length scale is doubled, and the average ⟨z⟩ is (3/2) times the length scale, then ⟨z⟩ = (3/2)(2 a₀_hydrogen ) = 3 a₀_hydrogen. \n\nYes, if a₀_hydrogen is the Bohr radius for the hydrogen atom, then here, the length scale is a = 2 a₀_hydrogen, and ⟨z⟩ = 3/2 a = 3 a₀_hydrogen. \n\nTherefore, the average distance is three times the Bohr radius. \n\nBut let me check with literature. I recall that the problem of an electron above a grounded conductor is sometimes called the image charge problem, and the bound states are sometimes referred to as surface states. The ground state energy and wavefunction can be found by solving the Schrödinger equation with the image charge potential. \n\nHowever, I don't recall the exact solution, but our variational method suggests that ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀. Given that the variational method with a trial wavefunction that matches the exact solution's form (exponential multiplied by z) gives this result, and given the analogy to the hydrogen atom, I think this is plausible. \n\nTherefore, the average distance between the electron and the conductor's surface is three times the Bohr radius. \n\nBut let me write the final expression in terms of the given constants. The Bohr radius is a₀ = (4 π ε₀ ħ² ) / (m e² ). Therefore:\n\n⟨z⟩ = 3 * (4 π ε₀ ħ² ) / (m e² ) \n\nBut let me check units. Yes, since ε₀ has units of C² s²/(N m² ), ħ has units of J s, m is kg, e is C. Let me verify the units of a₀:\n\n[ε₀] = C² s² / (N m² ) \n\n[ħ²] = (J² s² ) = (kg² m⁴ / s² ) * s² = kg² m⁴ / s⁰ \n\nWait, maybe better to use SI units. The Bohr radius formula:\n\na₀ = 4 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² )\n\nUnits:\n\n[ε₀] = C² s² / (N m² ) \n\n[ħ] has units of J s = N m s \n\nTherefore, [ħ²] = N² m² s² \n\n[m e²] = kg * C² \n\nSo overall:\n\n[a₀] = [C² s² / (N m² )] * [N² m² s² ] / [kg * C² ] \n\nSimplify:\n\n= [C² s² * N² m² s² ] / [N m² * kg * C² ] \n\n= [N s⁴ ] / [kg ] \n\nSince N = kg m/s², so:\n\n= [ (kg m / s² ) * s⁴ ] / kg = [ m * s² ] \n\nWait, this is not meters. There must be a mistake in unit analysis. Let me try again. \n\nLet me recall that in SI units, the Coulomb's law is F = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r². Therefore, ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²). \n\nThe reduced Planck constant ħ has units of J·s = N·m·s. \n\nThe Bohr radius is a₀ = 4πε₀ħ²/(m e²). Let's compute units:\n\n[ε₀] = C²/(N·m²)\n\n[ħ²] = (N·m·s)² = N²·m²·s²\n\n[m e²] = kg·C²\n\nTherefore:\n\n[a₀] = [C²/(N·m²)] * [N²·m²·s²] / [kg·C²] \n\nSimplify numerator: C² * N² * m² * s² / (N·m²) ) = C² * N * s² \n\nDenominator: kg * C² \n\nSo overall: [N * s² / kg] \n\nBut N = kg·m/s², so:\n\n[kg·m/s² * s² / kg] = m \n\nYes, correct. So units are meters. Good. \n\nTherefore, the expression ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀ is dimensionally correct. \n\nTherefore, the average distance is three times the Bohr radius. \n\nBut the problem says \"for the ground state, find the average distance...\". Therefore, the answer is ⟨z⟩ = 3 a₀, where a₀ is the Bohr radius. \n\nBut the problem might expect the answer expressed in terms of the given constants without referencing the Bohr radius. Let me write it explicitly:\n\n⟨z⟩ = 3 * (4 π ε₀ ħ² ) / (m e² ) \n\nSimplify:\n\n⟨z⟩ = 12 π ε₀ ħ² / (m e² )\n\nAlternatively, since the potential energy between the electron and its image is - e²/(8 π ε₀ z ), maybe there is another way to express it. However, the answer is most naturally expressed in terms of the Bohr radius. \n\nTherefore, the average distance between the electron and the conductor's surface is three times the Bohr radius. \n\nBut to make sure, let me check if there's another approach. For example, in the hydrogen atom, the expectation value ⟨r⟩ is 3 a₀ / 2. Here, we have a similar potential but in 1D with a different coefficient. Given that our potential is -k/z with k = e²/(8 π ε₀ ), compared to hydrogen's - e²/(4 π ε₀ r ), so half as strong. The length scale is therefore doubled, and the average ⟨z⟩ is (3/2) * 2 a₀ = 3 a₀. This seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average distance between the electron and the conductor's surface is \\boxed{3a_0}, where $ a_0 $ is the Bohr radius.\n</think>"}
