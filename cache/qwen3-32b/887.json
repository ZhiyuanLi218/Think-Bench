One turns 33 and 1/3 times per minute, and the other turns 45 times per minute. Both have a mark that starts pointing north, and I need to figure out after how many seconds both marks will point north again at the same time. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem. Both gears start with their marks pointing north. As they turn, their marks will rotate around. I need to find the first time when both marks are back to pointing north simultaneously. So, essentially, I need to find when both gears have completed an integer number of rotations, right? Because if they complete an integer number of rotations, their marks will be back where they started.\n\nSo, the key here is probably to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods. But since they're given in rotations per minute, I might need to convert that to time per rotation first. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me convert the rotation rates to rotations per second since the answer needs to be in seconds. The first gear does 33 1/3 rotations per minute. Let me convert that mixed number to an improper fraction. 33 1/3 is equal to 100/3 rotations per minute. Similarly, the second gear does 45 rotations per minute.\n\nNow, to find how long it takes for each gear to complete one full rotation, I can take the reciprocal of their rotation rates. So for the first gear, time per rotation is 1 / (100/3) minutes, which is 3/100 minutes. Similarly, for the second gear, it's 1/45 minutes per rotation.\n\nBut since we need the answer in seconds, let me convert those times to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\nFirst gear: 3/100 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = (3*60)/100 = 180/100 = 1.8 seconds per rotation.\n\nSecond gear: 1/45 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 60/45 = 1.333... seconds per rotation. Which is 4/3 seconds per rotation? Wait, 60 divided by 45 is 4/3? Wait, 60 divided by 45 is 1.333..., which is 4/3? Wait, 4/3 is approximately 1.333... yes, so that's correct. 4/3 seconds per rotation for the second gear.\n\nSo, the first gear takes 1.8 seconds per rotation, and the second takes 4/3 seconds per rotation. Now, to find when both marks will point north again, we need the least common multiple of these two times. That is, find the smallest time t such that t is a multiple of both 1.8 seconds and 4/3 seconds.\n\nBut LCM is typically defined for integers, so how do I handle decimal numbers or fractions? Maybe I should convert them to fractions first.\n\nSo, 1.8 seconds is equal to 9/5 seconds. Let me check: 9 divided by 5 is 1.8. Yes. And 4/3 seconds is already a fraction.\n\nSo, LCM of 9/5 and 4/3. Hmm. How do I find the LCM of two fractions?\n\nI remember that there's a formula for LCM of fractions: LCM(numerator1/ denominator1, numerator2/denominator2) = LCM(numerator1, numerator2) / GCD(denominator1, denominator2). Wait, is that right? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, actually, I think the formula is LCM(a/b, c/d) = LCM(a, c) / GCD(b, d). Let me check with an example. Suppose we have 1/2 and 1/3. Their LCM should be 1, because LCM of 1/2 and 1/3 is the smallest number that both 1/2 and 1/3 divide into. 1 divided by 1/2 is 2, which is integer, and 1 divided by 1/3 is 3, which is integer. So LCM is 1. Using the formula: LCM(1,1)/GCD(2,3) = 1 / 1 = 1. Correct. Another example: LCM(1/2, 3/4). What is the LCM? Let's see. Let me convert them to decimal: 0.5 and 0.75. What's the LCM? Let me think. Let's find t such that t is multiple of both 0.5 and 0.75. Let's list multiples of 0.5: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0... Multiples of 0.75: 0.75, 1.5, 2.25, 3.0... So the LCM is 1.5. Let's see if the formula gives that. LCM(1, 3)/GCD(2, 4) = LCM(1,3)/GCD(2,4) = 3 / 2 = 1.5. Correct. So yes, the formula is LCM(numerators)/GCD(denominators). So that seems to work.\n\nSo applying this formula to our problem: LCM(9/5, 4/3) = LCM(9, 4)/GCD(5, 3). Let's compute that. LCM(9,4). The LCM of 9 and 4. Prime factors of 9 are 3^2, prime factors of 4 are 2^2, so LCM is 2^2 * 3^2 = 4*9=36. GCD(5,3). Since 5 and 3 are coprime, their GCD is 1. Therefore, LCM(9/5, 4/3) is 36 / 1 = 36 seconds. So the answer is 36 seconds?\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let me check if after 36 seconds, both gears have completed an integer number of rotations.\n\nFirst gear: takes 9/5 seconds per rotation. Number of rotations in 36 seconds is 36 / (9/5) = 36 * (5/9) = 4 * 5 = 20 rotations. Okay, that's an integer. Second gear: takes 4/3 seconds per rotation. Number of rotations in 36 seconds is 36 / (4/3) = 36 * (3/4) = 9 * 3 = 27 rotations. Also an integer. So yes, after 36 seconds, both gears have completed integer numbers of rotations (20 and 27 respectively), so their marks are pointing north again. And since 36 is the LCM, it's the first time when this happens. So the answer is 36 seconds.\n\nBut let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by converting their rotation rates to revolutions per second and then finding when both have integer numbers?\n\nFirst gear: 100/3 rpm. So revolutions per second is (100/3)/60 = 100/(3*60) = 100/180 = 5/9 revolutions per second. Similarly, second gear: 45 rpm is 45/60 = 3/4 revolutions per second.\n\nSo, the question is: find the smallest t such that t*(5/9) is integer and t*(3/4) is integer. So t must be such that 5t/9 and 3t/4 are integers.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nLet t be the time in seconds. Then:\n\n5t/9 = integer => t must be a multiple of 9/ gcd(5,9). Since gcd(5,9)=1, so t must be multiple of 9.\n\nSimilarly, 3t/4 = integer => t must be multiple of 4/gcd(3,4)=4.\n\nTherefore, t must be multiple of LCM(9,4) = 36. Therefore, t=36 seconds. Same answer. So that's consistent. Therefore, 36 seconds is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way: think in terms of how often each gear returns to north. The first gear returns every 9/5 seconds, the second every 4/3 seconds. So we need the smallest t such that t is a multiple of both 9/5 and 4/3. Which is the LCM of 9/5 and 4/3, which we already found as 36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe convert the problem to rotations. Let me think. Suppose we want the number of rotations when they both align. Let me denote that after t minutes, the first gear has done 100/3 * t rotations, and the second has done 45 * t rotations. We want both numbers to be integers, and find the minimal t>0 such that this is true. Then convert t minutes to seconds.\n\nSo, 100/3 * t and 45 * t must both be integers. Let me write equations:\n\nLet t be in minutes. Let me denote t = x minutes. Then:\n\n(100/3)x is integer, and 45x is integer.\n\nSo, find the minimal x such that both 100x/3 and 45x are integers. Let me write 100x/3 integer implies that 100x is divisible by 3. Since 100 and 3 are coprime (gcd(100,3)=1), so x must be divisible by 3. Let me write x = 3k, where k is a positive real number.\n\nThen substituting into 45x: 45*(3k) = 135k must be integer. Also, 100x/3 = 100*(3k)/3 = 100k must be integer. Therefore, both 100k and 135k must be integers. Therefore, k must be such that k is a common multiple of 1/100 and 1/135? Or rather, k must be a rational number such that 100k and 135k are integers. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote k as a fraction a/b in simplest terms. Then 100*(a/b) must be integer, so b divides 100a. Similarly, 135*(a/b) must be integer, so b divides 135a. Since a/b is in simplest terms, gcd(a,b)=1. Therefore, b divides 100 and b divides 135. Therefore, b divides gcd(100,135). Let me compute gcd(100,135). Prime factors of 100: 2^2 * 5^2. Prime factors of 135: 3^3 * 5. Therefore, gcd(100,135) is 5. Therefore, b divides 5. Therefore, possible values of b are 1, 5.\n\nSo, k = a/b where b is 1 or 5, and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\nMoreover, since we want the minimal x, which is 3k, we need the minimal k>0 such that 100k and 135k are integers. Let's find minimal k.\n\nCase 1: b=1. Then k is integer. Then minimal k is 1. Then x=3*1=3 minutes. Then check 100k=100*1=100 integer, 135k=135*1=135 integer. Okay, works. But maybe there's a smaller x?\n\nCase 2: b=5. Then k = a/5, with gcd(a,5)=1. Then 100k = 100*(a/5) = 20a must be integer, which it is. 135k = 135*(a/5) = 27a must be integer, which it is. Therefore, minimal a is 1. Therefore, k=1/5. Therefore, x=3*(1/5)= 3/5 minutes. Which is less than 3 minutes. Therefore, 3/5 minutes is 36 seconds. Which is the answer we had before. Therefore, the minimal x is 3/5 minutes, which is 36 seconds. Therefore, confirming again that 36 seconds is the answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 36 seconds. Therefore, I think that is correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nSo, the problem was about two gears with different rotation speeds, starting aligned with a mark pointing north. We need to find when they both align again. The key is to find when both have completed integer numbers of rotations, which can be found by LCM of their periods. Since their periods are fractions, we use the LCM formula for fractions, or convert to finding when their rotation counts are integers. Both approaches lead to 36 seconds.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just check with actual rotation counts:\n\nFirst gear: 33 1/3 rpm = 100/3 rpm. In 36 seconds, which is 0.6 minutes, rotations = 100/3 * 0.6 = 100/3 * 3/5 = 100/5 = 20 rotations. Correct.\n\nSecond gear: 45 rpm. In 0.6 minutes, rotations = 45 * 0.6 = 27 rotations. Correct. 20 and 27 are integers, so both marks are back to north. And since LCM(20, 27) is 540, but that's rotations... Wait, no, maybe not necessary. The key is that the time is the LCM of their individual periods.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of frequency. The first gear has a frequency of 100/3 rpm, which is 5/9 rps (revolutions per second). The second gear has 45 rpm, which is 3/4 rps. The question is similar to finding when both gears' marks align again, which relates to the beat frequency? Not sure if that helps here, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, think about the angular positions. Let me define theta1(t) = (5/9)*t * 2π mod 2π, and theta2(t) = (3/4)*t * 2π mod 2π. We want theta1(t) = theta2(t) = 0. Which is equivalent to (5/9)*t and (3/4)*t being integers, which is the same as before. So again, same condition.\n\nTherefore, I think 36 seconds is correct. I can't see any mistake in my reasoning. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe two gears will next have both their marks pointing due north after \\boxed{36} seconds.\n</think>"}
