The problem says that at the moment of release, the kinetic energy is exactly equal to the gravitational potential energy, taking the horizontal ground as the zero point. Alright, let me start by recalling some physics concepts here.\n\nFirst, gravitational potential energy (GPE) is given by U = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height above the ground. Kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv², where v is the velocity. The problem states that at the moment of release, KE equals GPE. So, setting them equal:\n\n(1/2)mv₀² = mgh\n\nWait, the block is thrown horizontally, so its initial velocity is entirely horizontal. Let me denote the initial velocity as v₀. Since it's thrown horizontally, the initial vertical velocity component is zero. So, at the moment of release, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv₀² and the potential energy is mgh. Setting them equal:\n\n(1/2)mv₀² = mgh\n\nI can cancel the mass m from both sides:\n\n(1/2)v₀² = gh\n\nSo, v₀² = 2gh. That gives me a relationship between the initial speed and the height from which it's thrown. Maybe I'll need this later.\n\nNow, the question is about the angle when it hits the ground. To find the angle, I need to know the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity at impact. The horizontal component should remain constant because there's no air resistance, so horizontal velocity is always v₀. The vertical component will increase due to gravity.\n\nLet me denote the vertical velocity at impact as v_y. Since the block starts with zero vertical velocity, we can use kinematic equations to find v_y. The formula for final velocity when you have constant acceleration is:\n\nv_y² = u_y² + 2a s\n\nWhere u_y is initial vertical velocity (which is 0), a is acceleration (g here, since it's downward), and s is displacement (which is h, but downward, so maybe positive h if we take downward as positive? Wait, let me be careful with signs.\n\nLet me take downward as positive for vertical motion. Then acceleration a = g, initial vertical velocity u_y = 0, displacement s = h. Then:\n\nv_y² = 0 + 2gh => v_y = sqrt(2gh)\n\nWait, but from earlier, we had v₀² = 2gh. Therefore, v_y = sqrt(v₀²) = v₀. So vertical component of velocity at impact is equal to the initial horizontal velocity?\n\nSo, the horizontal component is v₀, vertical component is v₀. Therefore, the velocity vector at impact has components (v₀, v₀). Therefore, the angle θ with the horizontal is given by tanθ = v_y / v_x = v₀ / v₀ = 1. Therefore θ = arctan(1) = π/4. Which is option B. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, let me verify the steps again. First, initial kinetic energy equals potential energy: (1/2)mv₀² = mgh => v₀² = 2gh. Then, for vertical motion, starting from rest, falling distance h, final vertical speed is sqrt(2gh). Therefore, vertical speed is sqrt(2gh) which is equal to v₀. Therefore, yes, vertical component is v₀, horizontal component is v₀. Therefore, velocity vector is at 45 degrees, so π/4. So answer is B?\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, if the vertical component is sqrt(2gh), and horizontal component is v₀, and since v₀² = 2gh, so v₀ = sqrt(2gh). Therefore, yes, both components are equal. Therefore, tan(theta) = 1, so theta is 45 degrees, π/4. So answer is B. But let me check if I made any wrong assumptions.\n\nWait, the problem says the block is thrown horizontally, so initial vertical velocity is zero. The horizontal velocity remains v₀. The vertical velocity at impact is sqrt(2gh). But since v₀² = 2gh, then v_y = sqrt(v₀²) = v₀. Therefore, yes, they are equal. So the velocity vector makes equal horizontal and vertical components, so 45 degrees. So angle is π/4. Therefore, option B. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose I didn't use the given condition that KE equals GPE initially. Suppose I just did the general case. Let's say, if you throw something horizontally from height h, then the vertical component of velocity when it lands is sqrt(2gh), and horizontal component is v₀. Then the angle is arctan( sqrt(2gh)/v₀ ). But in this case, since we have (1/2)mv₀² = mgh => v₀² = 2gh => v₀ = sqrt(2gh). Therefore, substituting back, arctan( sqrt(2gh)/sqrt(2gh) ) = arctan(1) = π/4. Therefore, yes, answer is B. So seems straightforward. But why is this a problem? Maybe I made a mistake?\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider total mechanical energy? Let me check.\n\nAt the moment of release, KE equals PE. So total mechanical energy is KE + PE = 2KE (since KE=PE). Then, when it hits the ground, the PE is zero, so all energy is KE. Therefore, the final KE is twice the initial KE. Since KE is (1/2)mv², then final kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_total² = 2*(1/2)mv₀² => v_total² = 2v₀² => v_total = v₀*sqrt(2). But the total velocity at impact is sqrt(v_x² + v_y²) = sqrt(v₀² + (sqrt(2gh))²) = sqrt(v₀² + 2gh). But since v₀² = 2gh, this becomes sqrt(2gh + 2gh) = sqrt(4gh) = 2*sqrt(gh). But v_total should also be v₀*sqrt(2). Since v₀² = 2gh, v₀ = sqrt(2gh), so v_total = sqrt(2)*sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(4gh) = 2*sqrt(gh). Which matches. So that's consistent. Therefore, the total speed is 2*sqrt(gh), but the horizontal and vertical components are each sqrt(2gh). Wait, sqrt(2gh) is v₀. So yes, components are v₀ and v₀. So angle is 45 degrees. So answer is B. So why is there an option D? Maybe I need to check again?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the relation between the velocity components? Let me think again. Suppose the horizontal velocity is v₀, vertical velocity is v_y = sqrt(2gh). And since v₀² = 2gh, then v₀ = sqrt(2gh). Therefore, both components are equal. Therefore, tan(theta) = v_y / v_x = 1. Therefore theta is 45 degrees. Therefore angle between velocity and horizontal is π/4. So answer is B. So maybe the answer is B?\n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. Suppose h is some value, say h = 5 meters. Let me take g = 10 m/s² for simplicity. Then, from the condition (1/2)mv₀² = mgh => v₀² = 2gh = 2*10*5 = 100 => v₀ = 10 m/s. Then, the vertical component when it hits the ground is sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2*10*5) = sqrt(100) = 10 m/s. Therefore, horizontal is 10, vertical is 10. So velocity vector is 45 degrees. So angle is π/4. So answer is B. So why is there an option C or D? Maybe I misunderstood the question? Wait, the problem says \"the angle between the direction of the block's velocity and the horizontal direction when it hits the ground\". So if horizontal is x-axis, velocity vector is going to be in fourth quadrant? But angle is measured from horizontal, so it's just the arctangent of vertical over horizontal. Since vertical component is downward, but since we're talking about the magnitude of the angle, it's just 45 degrees. So answer is B. So why is this confusing?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that vertical velocity is sqrt(2gh) is wrong? Let me check that. The formula v² = u² + 2as. Here, u = 0, a = g, s = h. Therefore, v = sqrt(2gh). Yes, that's correct. So that's the vertical speed. So with the given condition, horizontal speed is same as vertical speed. So angle is 45 degrees. So answer is B. So maybe the answer is B? But let me check other approaches.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about energy. At impact, all energy is kinetic. Initially, total mechanical energy is KE + PE = 2KE. Therefore, final KE is twice initial KE. The initial KE is (1/2)mv₀². Final KE is (1/2)mv² = 2*(1/2)mv₀² => v² = 2v₀². But the final velocity squared is v_x² + v_y². Since v_x = v₀, then v₀² + v_y² = 2v₀² => v_y² = v₀² => v_y = v₀. Therefore, same conclusion. So angle is 45 degrees. So answer is B. Therefore, I think the answer is B. But why is option C there? Maybe I made a mistake in relating the initial KE and PE?\n\nWait, let me check the initial condition again. The problem says \"its kinetic energy is exactly equal to its gravitational potential energy at the moment of release\". So KE = PE. So (1/2)mv₀² = mgh. Yes, so that gives v₀² = 2gh. So that is correct. So no problem here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the velocity components differently? For example, maybe the question is about the angle with respect to the horizontal direction, but considering the direction of velocity. Since the block is falling down, the velocity vector is downward and to the right (assuming it was thrown to the right). So the angle is measured from the horizontal to the velocity vector, going downward. But the angle itself is still arctangent of (v_y / v_x), which is 45 degrees. So regardless of direction, the angle between the velocity vector and horizontal is 45 degrees. Therefore, π/4. So answer is B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another approach where time of flight is considered? Let me try that approach. The time to fall from height h is given by h = (1/2)gt² => t = sqrt(2h/g). Then, the vertical component of velocity is v_y = gt = g*sqrt(2h/g) = sqrt(2h*g²/g) = sqrt(2gh). Which is same as before. And horizontal velocity is v₀. And since v₀² = 2gh, so v₀ = sqrt(2gh). Therefore, again, same conclusion. Therefore, angle is 45 degrees. Therefore, answer is B. \n\nBut wait, let me check if the question is perhaps not about the angle of velocity, but something else? The problem says \"the angle between the direction of the block's velocity and the horizontal direction when it hits the ground\". No, that's exactly what I calculated. So seems like answer is B. However, maybe there's a trick here? For example, maybe the question is in Chinese and there was a translation issue? No, the problem is presented in English here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the initial velocity not being purely horizontal? But no, it says \"thrown horizontally\", so initial vertical velocity is zero. So I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, answer is B. So the answer is option B, π/4. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are (A) π/6, (B) π/4, (C) π/3, (D) 5π/12. So π/4 is 45 degrees, π/6 is 30, π/3 is 60, 5π/12 is 75 degrees. So according to my calculation, answer is B. However, I remember sometimes in these problems, people might confuse the angle with respect to vertical or something else. But the question says \"angle between the direction of the block's velocity and the horizontal direction\", so it's definitely with respect to horizontal. So if the velocity vector is downward, the angle is measured from the horizontal to the velocity vector, which is 45 degrees. Therefore, π/4. So answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the total mechanical energy again? Let me think. Suppose the block is thrown horizontally with KE equal to GPE. Then, when it lands, all energy is KE. So total KE final is twice initial KE. Which would mean that the speed is sqrt(2) times the initial speed. Which is consistent with the components: horizontal component v₀, vertical component v₀, total speed sqrt(2)v₀. So that checks out. So angle is 45 degrees. Therefore, answer is B. \n\nTherefore, after checking multiple approaches and verifying each step, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
