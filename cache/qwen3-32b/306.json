The circle has a radius of √50 cm, which is approximately 7.07 cm, but I'll keep it as √50 for exactness. The problem mentions a notched circle, with points A, B, and C. AB is 6 cm, BC is 2 cm, and angle ABC is a right angle. There's also an Asymptote figure provided, which I can't see, but maybe I can visualize it based on the description.\n\nFirst, let me try to sketch mentally what the figure looks like. There's a circle with center O, and points A, B, C on or related to the circle. Since AB is 6 cm and BC is 2 cm with a right angle at B, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle. The Asymptote code seems to define point A as being on the circle at 45 degrees, then B is directly below A (since it says A.x and A.y - r, but maybe that's specific to their coordinate system). Then C is found by intersecting a horizontal line from B with the circle. The Asymptote code draws an arc from A to C, then connects C to B to A to B.\n\nBut maybe I need to assign coordinates to these points to solve the problem. Let me try to set up a coordinate system. Let me assume that the center of the circle O is at (0, 0). Let me denote coordinates for A, B, C accordingly.\n\nBut how? The Asymptote code says:\n\npair O=(0,0), A=r*dir(45),B=(A.x,A.y-r); path P=circle(O,r); pair C=intersectionpoint(B--(B.x+r,B.y),P);\n\nSo in their code, point A is at radius r in the direction of 45 degrees, so in coordinates, that would be (r*cos(45°), r*sin(45°)). Then point B is (A.x, A.y - r). Since r is 10 in their code (but in our problem, r is √50). Wait, in the problem, the radius is √50, so maybe the Asymptote code is using r=10 for illustration, but in reality, we need to use √50. Anyway, the key is that point B is directly below point A by a distance equal to the radius? Wait, if A is at (A.x, A.y), then B is (A.x, A.y - r). But if the radius is √50, then that would make AB vertical? But AB is given as 6 cm. Wait, but if AB is vertical and of length 6 cm, but the radius is √50 ≈ 7.07 cm, then that suggests that the distance from A to the center is √50, so if B is below A by 6 cm, then the distance from B to the center would be... Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, they have:\n\npair O=(0,0), A=r*dir(45), B=(A.x, A.y - r);\n\nSo if O is (0,0), A is at (r*cos(45°), r*sin(45°)), and B is (A.x, A.y - r). So the coordinates of B would be (r*cos(45°), r*sin(45°) - r) = (r*cos(45°), r(sin(45°) - 1)). Then, the distance AB is the vertical distance between A and B, which is r (since the y-coordinate difference is r). But in the problem statement, AB is 6 cm. However, in the Asymptote code, they have r=10, but in the problem, the radius is √50. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, AB is not vertical? Wait, but according to the problem, AB is 6 cm, BC is 2 cm, angle ABC is right angle. So maybe the Asymptote code is just an example, but with different numbers.\n\nTherefore, maybe I need to not rely too much on the Asymptote code's specific coordinates but instead use the given information: radius √50, AB=6, BC=2, right angle at B. Need to find the square of the distance from B to the center.\n\nLet me think. Let me denote the center as O. Let me assign coordinates. Maybe I can set coordinate system with point B at the origin? Or maybe with O at (0,0). Let me try O at (0,0). Let me suppose coordinates for points A, B, C.\n\nSince angle ABC is a right angle, and AB = 6, BC = 2, triangle ABC is right-angled at B, so AB ⊥ BC. Also, points A and C are on the circle with center O and radius √50. So OA = OC = √50. Point B is inside the circle? Or maybe outside? Since AB is 6 and OA is √50 ≈ 7.07, so if OA is √50 and AB is 6, then B could be inside the circle. Similarly, OC is √50, BC is 2, so B is inside the circle.\n\nTherefore, points A and C are on the circle, B is inside. The problem is to find |BO|².\n\nLet me denote coordinates. Let me assume coordinates with O at (0, 0). Let me assign coordinates to B as (h, k). Then, since AB = 6 and BC = 2 with ABC right-angled at B, I need to find coordinates for A and C such that A and C lie on the circle, and the distances and right angle hold.\n\nBut perhaps there is a better way. Maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates based on the right angle at B.\n\nLet me consider vector approach. Since ABC is right-angled at B, vectors BA and BC are perpendicular. So BA · BC = 0.\n\nLet me denote coordinates. Let me suppose that B is at (h, k). Let me suppose that vector BA is some vector (x, y) and vector BC is some vector perpendicular to (x, y). Since AB = 6 and BC = 2, the lengths are fixed. But points A and C are on the circle.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is 6 and BC is 2, and ABC is right-angled at B, coordinates can be set up such that B is at (0, 0), A is at (6, 0), and C is at (0, 2). But then points A and C must lie on the circle with center O somewhere, radius √50. Then need to find coordinates of O such that OA = OC = √50, then compute BO². Wait, maybe this is a better approach. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place coordinate system with B at (0, 0). Let me set B as origin. Since angle at B is right angle, let me let A be along x-axis and C along y-axis. So coordinates:\n\nB = (0, 0)\n\nA = (6, 0) because AB = 6\n\nC = (0, 2) because BC = 2\n\nNow, points A and C lie on the circle with center O (let's say O has coordinates (h, k)) and radius √50. Therefore:\n\nOA² = (h - 6)^2 + (k - 0)^2 = 50\n\nOC² = (h - 0)^2 + (k - 2)^2 = 50\n\nTherefore, we have two equations:\n\n1. (h - 6)^2 + k² = 50\n\n2. h² + (k - 2)^2 = 50\n\nWe can solve these two equations for h and k. Then, once we have h and k, the distance from B (which is at (0, 0)) to O is h² + k², so we need to find h² + k².\n\nLet me expand both equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(h² - 12h + 36) + k² = 50 ⇒ h² + k² -12h + 36 = 50 ⇒ h² + k² -12h = 14\n\nSecond equation:\n\nh² + (k² -4k + 4) = 50 ⇒ h² + k² -4k + 4 = 50 ⇒ h² + k² -4k = 46\n\nNow, let me denote S = h² + k². Then, the first equation becomes:\n\nS - 12h = 14\n\nSecond equation becomes:\n\nS - 4k = 46\n\nSo we have:\n\nS - 12h = 14 ...(1)\n\nS - 4k = 46 ...(2)\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(S - 4k) - (S - 12h) = 46 - 14 ⇒ -4k + 12h = 32 ⇒ 12h - 4k = 32 ⇒ Divide both sides by 4: 3h - k = 8 ⇒ k = 3h - 8\n\nSo k is expressed in terms of h. Now, let me substitute k = 3h - 8 into one of the equations. Let's take equation (1):\n\nS - 12h = 14. But S is h² + k². Therefore:\n\nh² + k² -12h = 14\n\nBut k = 3h - 8, so:\n\nh² + (3h - 8)^2 -12h = 14\n\nCompute (3h - 8)^2 = 9h² - 48h + 64\n\nThus:\n\nh² + 9h² - 48h + 64 -12h = 14 ⇒ 10h² - 60h + 64 = 14 ⇒ 10h² - 60h + 50 = 0 ⇒ Divide both sides by 10: h² - 6h + 5 = 0 ⇒ (h - 1)(h - 5) = 0 ⇒ h = 1 or h = 5.\n\nSo h can be 1 or 5. Let me find corresponding k:\n\nIf h = 1, then k = 3(1) - 8 = 3 - 8 = -5.\n\nIf h = 5, then k = 3(5) - 8 = 15 - 8 = 7.\n\nTherefore, we have two possible centers: O is either (1, -5) or (5, 7). Now, need to check if these are valid. Let me check with the original equations.\n\nFirst, check for O(1, -5):\n\nOA² = (1 - 6)^2 + (-5 - 0)^2 = (-5)^2 + (-5)^2 = 25 + 25 = 50. Correct.\n\nOC² = (1 - 0)^2 + (-5 - 2)^2 = 1 + (-7)^2 = 1 + 49 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for O(5, 7):\n\nOA² = (5 - 6)^2 + (7 - 0)^2 = (-1)^2 + 49 = 1 + 49 = 50. Correct.\n\nOC² = (5 - 0)^2 + (7 - 2)^2 = 25 + 25 = 50. Correct.\n\nSo both centers are valid. But since the Asymptote code seems to have the center at (0,0) and points arranged in a certain way, but since we have chosen coordinates with B at (0,0), maybe there are two possible positions for the circle? However, the problem says \"the center of the circle\", implying a unique answer. Therefore, perhaps both positions give the same distance from B to O? Let me check.\n\nFor O(1, -5): distance from B(0,0) is √(1² + (-5)^2) = √(1 + 25) = √26. Therefore, square is 26.\n\nFor O(5, 7): distance from B(0,0) is √(5² + 7²) = √(25 + 49) = √74. Square is 74.\n\nBut the problem says the radius is √50. Wait, but both centers are valid? How come?\n\nWait, maybe in the Asymptote code, the center is at (0,0), but in our coordinate system, we placed B at (0,0). So there's no conflict. However, the problem is asking for the square of the distance from B to the center. Depending on which center we take, it's 26 or 74. But the problem must have a unique answer. Therefore, perhaps only one of them is valid based on the diagram.\n\nLooking back at the Asymptote code, which defines point A at dir(45), which is 45 degrees, so in their coordinate system, A is in the first quadrant. Then point B is (A.x, A.y - r). If their radius is 10, then B would be below A. Then point C is intersection of horizontal line from B with the circle. In their code, the arc is drawn from A to C, so probably C is in the fourth quadrant if A is in first quadrant and B is below A.\n\nIn our coordinate system where B is at (0,0), A is at (6, 0) and C is at (0, 2). If O is at (1, -5), then coordinates:\n\nPoint A is (6, 0), O is (1, -5). The line from A to O goes from (6,0) to (1, -5). Similarly, point C is (0, 2), O is (1, -5). The line from C to O goes from (0, 2) to (1, -5). Depending on the diagram, maybe this is the correct position. Alternatively, O at (5,7): A(6,0), O(5,7): line from (6,0) to (5,7). Point C(0,2) to O(5,7): line from (0,2) to (5,7). Which one is consistent with the Asymptote code?\n\nIn the Asymptote code, point C is found by drawing a horizontal line from B to the right. In our coordinate system, with B at (0,0), horizontal line to the right would be along positive x-axis. However, point C is at (0,2), which is along the y-axis. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, in our coordinate system, we set A at (6,0) and C at (0,2). But according to the Asymptote code, point C is on the horizontal line from B going to the right (B--(B.x + r, B.y)), which would be horizontal line to the right from B. However, in our setup, point C is on the y-axis, which is vertical. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Therefore, perhaps my coordinate assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the directions. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the Asymptote code:\n\nAfter defining B as (A.x, A.y - r), which in their case A is at (r*cos(45°), r*sin(45°)), so B is directly below A by r units in the y-direction. Then, they define C as the intersection of the horizontal line from B going to the right (B.x + r, B.y) with the circle. Therefore, in their diagram, BC is horizontal, going to the right, and AB is vertical, going downward. Therefore, angle at B is between vertical AB and horizontal BC, hence right angle. Therefore, in their diagram, AB is vertical, BC is horizontal.\n\nTherefore, in my coordinate system, if I want to replicate this, I need AB vertical and BC horizontal. However, when I set B at (0,0), A at (0, something) and C at (something, 0). Wait, but AB is 6 cm. If AB is vertical, then A is either (0, 6) or (0, -6) if B is at (0,0). But BC is horizontal, length 2 cm, so C is (2, 0) or (-2, 0). However, in the Asymptote code, they go from B to (B.x + r, B.y), so positive x-direction. Therefore, C is at (2, 0). Then points A(0, 6), B(0,0), C(2, 0). Then OA and OC are radii.\n\nBut in this case, OA is distance from O to A(0,6), OC is distance from O to C(2, 0). Let me try this coordinate system.\n\nLet me redo the coordinates with AB vertical and BC horizontal.\n\nLet me place B at (0, 0). Let me let AB be vertical with length 6. Let me assume A is at (0, 6). Then BC is horizontal with length 2, so C is at (2, 0). Then points A(0,6) and C(2, 0) are on the circle with center O(h, k) and radius √50. Then:\n\nOA²: (h - 0)^2 + (k - 6)^2 = 50 ⇒ h² + (k - 6)^2 = 50 ...(1)\n\nOC²: (h - 2)^2 + (k - 0)^2 = 50 ⇒ (h - 2)^2 + k² = 50 ...(2)\n\nThen, expand both equations:\n\nEquation (1): h² + k² - 12k + 36 = 50 ⇒ h² + k² -12k = 14 ...(1a)\n\nEquation (2): h² - 4h + 4 + k² = 50 ⇒ h² + k² -4h = 46 ...(2a)\n\nLet S = h² + k² again. Then:\n\nFrom (1a): S -12k = 14\n\nFrom (2a): S -4h = 46\n\nTherefore:\n\nS = 14 + 12k\n\nand S = 46 + 4h\n\nTherefore, 14 + 12k = 46 + 4h ⇒ 12k - 4h = 32 ⇒ 3k - h = 8 ⇒ h = 3k - 8\n\nNow, substitute h = 3k - 8 into one of the equations. Let's take equation (1a):\n\nS -12k = 14. But S = h² + k² = (3k - 8)^2 + k².\n\nSo:\n\n(9k² - 48k + 64) + k² -12k = 14 ⇒ 10k² - 60k + 64 = 14 ⇒ 10k² -60k + 50 = 0 ⇒ divide by 10: k² - 6k + 5 = 0 ⇒ (k - 1)(k - 5) = 0 ⇒ k = 1 or k = 5.\n\nThen, h = 3k - 8:\n\nIf k = 1, h = 3(1) -8 = -5\n\nIf k = 5, h = 3(5) -8 = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nTherefore, centers are at (-5, 1) and (7, 5). Let me check OA² and OC².\n\nFor O(-5, 1):\n\nOA²: (-5 - 0)^2 + (1 - 6)^2 = 25 + 25 = 50. Correct.\n\nOC²: (-5 - 2)^2 + (1 - 0)^2 = (-7)^2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor O(7, 5):\n\nOA²: (7 - 0)^2 + (5 - 6)^2 = 49 + 1 = 50. Correct.\n\nOC²: (7 - 2)^2 + (5 - 0)^2 = 25 + 25 = 50. Correct.\n\nNow, distance from B(0,0) to O is sqrt(h² + k²). Therefore, square of distance is h² + k².\n\nFor O(-5, 1): (-5)^2 + 1^2 = 25 + 1 = 26.\n\nFor O(7, 5): 7² + 5² = 49 + 25 = 74.\n\nAgain, two possible answers. But which one is correct? The problem mentions a \"notched circle\", which probably implies that the notch is the right-angled corner at B. Depending on where the center is, the notch could be on different sides.\n\nLooking back at the Asymptote code, which defines point A at dir(45), which is 45 degrees in the first quadrant. Then point B is below A, so in their diagram, with center at (0,0), point A is in first quadrant, B is below A (so still in first or fourth?), and C is intersection of horizontal line from B to the right. If their center is at (0,0), then with A at dir(45), which is (cos45, sin45), then B is (A.x, A.y - r). If r is 10, then A is (approx 7.07, 7.07), B would be (7.07, 7.07 - 10) = (7.07, -2.93). Then drawing a horizontal line to the right from B would intersect the circle at some point C. Depending on the radius, but in their case, the arc is drawn from A to C. In our problem, with AB=6, BC=2, radius sqrt(50). So if we think of the Asymptote diagram, with center O at (0,0), then point B is inside the circle. Depending on the position of O, in our coordinate system where B is at (0,0), O is at (-5,1) or (7,5). Which one corresponds to the Asymptote diagram?\n\nIf in Asymptote, O is at (0,0), and point B is below A. In our coordinate system, if O is at (-5, 1), then point A is (0,6). The center is at (-5,1). So point A(0,6) is located to the right and above the center. Similarly, point B is at (0,0), which is below A. Then horizontal line from B to the right would go towards positive x-axis, intersecting the circle at C(2,0). In this case, the center is at (-5,1). The Asymptote diagram's center is at (0,0), but in our coordinate system it's different. However, since we have two solutions, maybe both are possible, but given the Asymptote code's construction, maybe only one makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another condition. Since in the Asymptote code, the arc is drawn from A to C, going through the part of the circle that forms the notch. Depending on the position of O, the arc from A to C could be the major or minor arc. If O is at (-5,1), then points A(0,6) and C(2,0): the arc from A to C would pass near the center? Let me see. Alternatively, if O is at (7,5), then points A(0,6) and C(2,0) are on the circle. The arc from A to C would be on the other side.\n\nBut how to figure out which one is correct? Maybe based on the position of the notch. If the notch is the right angle at B, which is inside the circle. If O is at (-5,1), then the distance from B(0,0) to O is sqrt(26) ≈ 5.1 cm, which is less than radius sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07 cm, so B is inside. Similarly for O at (7,5), distance is sqrt(74) ≈ 8.6 cm, which is greater than radius sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07 cm. Wait, that can't be! Wait sqrt(74) is approx 8.6, which is greater than sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07. But O is the center of the circle, so distance from O to B cannot be greater than radius unless B is outside. But earlier we had points A and C on the circle. If O is at (7,5), then distance from O to B is sqrt(74) ≈ 8.6, which is greater than radius sqrt(50). However, points A and C are on the circle. For example, OA is sqrt( (7 - 0)^2 + (5 - 6)^2 ) = sqrt(49 + 1) = sqrt(50). So OA is radius. But OB is sqrt( (7 - 0)^2 + (5 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(49 + 25) = sqrt(74) ≈ 8.6 cm. Therefore, B is outside the circle? But earlier we thought B is inside. Wait, how come?\n\nWait, if O is at (7,5), then point B(0,0) is outside the circle? But points A(0,6) and C(2,0) are on the circle. Let me check if B is inside or outside. The distance from O to B is sqrt(74) ≈ 8.6 cm, and radius is sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07 cm. Therefore, B is outside the circle. But in the problem statement, the tool is a notched circle, which probably implies that B is inside the circle, as the notch is a part removed from the circle. If B is outside, then the notch would be outside? Not sure. However, if O is at (-5,1), then distance from O to B is sqrt(26) ≈ 5.1 cm < 7.07 cm, so B is inside. Therefore, this seems more plausible. Therefore, probably the correct center is (-5,1), giving BO² = 26. Therefore, the answer is 26. However, let me check again.\n\nBut how do we know which center is correct? The problem didn't specify the position of the notch relative to the circle. But given that AB is 6 cm and BC is 2 cm, and radius is sqrt(50). Let me check for O at (-5,1):\n\nCoordinates:\n\nO(-5,1), A(0,6), B(0,0), C(2,0). Let me check if the notch makes sense. The notch is the right angle at B, so removing the part of the circle near B? If B is inside the circle, then the notch would be a cut from A to B to C. Since A and C are on the circle, and B is inside. So the tool is a circle with a notch cut out, forming the right angle at B. This seems plausible.\n\nIf O were at (7,5), then B is outside, so the notch would be outside the circle? That seems odd for a cutting tool. Usually, notches are cut into the object, so removing material from the circle. Therefore, B is inside the circle, so O at (-5,1) is correct. Therefore, BO² is 26.\n\nBut let me verify once more. Let me check if with O at (-5,1), the Asymptote code's construction makes sense. In the Asymptote code, point A is at dir(45), but in our case, with O at (-5,1), point A is at (0,6). The angle of point A with respect to center O(-5,1). Let me compute the angle. The vector from O to A is (0 - (-5), 6 - 1) = (5, 5). So direction is 45 degrees above the positive x-axis. Therefore, point A is at 45 degrees from the center, which matches the Asymptote code's A = r*dir(45). Therefore, this seems consistent. Then point B is (A.x, A.y - r). Wait in Asymptote code, B is (A.x, A.y - r). In their code, O is (0,0), A is at dir(45)*r, so coordinates (r*cos45, r*sin45). Then B is (A.x, A.y - r). In our case, with O at (-5,1), point A is at (0,6). If we think of translating coordinates so that O is at (0,0), then point A would be at (5,5) as we saw earlier (since O is at (-5,1), A is (0,6) which is 5 right and 5 up from O). Therefore, in O's coordinate system, A is (5,5), so dir(45) direction. Then B in their code is (A.x, A.y - r). In their code's coordinate system, that would be (5, 5 - sqrt(50)). But in our case, with O at (-5,1), point B is at (0,0). Let me check if (0,0) corresponds to (A.x, A.y - r) in O's coordinate system. In O's coordinate system, A is (5,5). Then A.y - r would be 5 - sqrt(50). But sqrt(50) is approx 7.07, so 5 - 7.07 ≈ -2.07. However, in our case, B is at (0,0). Therefore, there's a discrepancy. Wait, unless there's scaling or different coordinate systems.\n\nBut maybe the Asymptote code is just illustrative with r=10, while our problem has r=√50. Therefore, the exact positions differ, but the construction is similar. Therefore, perhaps it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my coordinate system is not aligned with the Asymptote code's, but since we arrived at BO² = 26 or 74, and based on B being inside the circle, 26 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach to verify.\n\nLet me consider coordinates again. Let me take O(-5,1), B(0,0). Then coordinates:\n\nA(0,6), C(2,0). Let me check if the line BC (from B(0,0) to C(2,0)) intersects the circle only at C? Since C is on the circle, and B is inside, so the line from B through C goes out of the circle at C. Similarly, line BA goes from B(0,0) up to A(0,6), which is on the circle. Therefore, the notch is between A and C, with B inside. This seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if O is at (7,5), then line BC is from B(0,0) to C(2,0). Since B is outside the circle, and C is on the circle, then the line from B to C would start outside and go into the circle at C. Similarly, line BA goes from B(0,0) to A(0,6). Since OA is radius, A is on the circle. Since B is outside, the line BA would go from outside to A on the circle. Therefore, in this case, the notch would be outside the circle? Not sure. But since the problem says it's a notched circle, meaning part of the circle is removed, which is more plausible if B is inside. Therefore, I think 26 is the answer.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Maybe coordinate-free.\n\nLet me consider the problem again. Given a circle with radius √50, points A and C on the circle, AB = 6, BC = 2, angle ABC = 90°. Find BO².\n\nLet me use coordinate geometry but with another method. Let me consider vectors or coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, use the British flag theorem? Wait, the British flag theorem says that for any point P in the plane of rectangle, PA² + PC² = PB² + PD². But we don't have a rectangle here. However, since ABC is a right-angled triangle, maybe we can construct a rectangle?\n\nAlternatively, since ABC is right-angled at B, let me consider completing the rectangle. Let me construct a rectangle with AB and BC as adjacent sides. Let me denote D as the fourth corner, so that ABDC is a rectangle. Wait, if ABC is right-angled at B, then D would be such that BD = AC, etc. But maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since OA² = OC² = 50, AB = 6, BC = 2, angle ABC = 90°, maybe use coordinate geometry as before.\n\nAlternatively, use complex numbers? Maybe not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that O lies on the perpendicular bisector of AC.\n\nSince OA = OC, O lies on the perpendicular bisector of AC. Let me find coordinates of A and C. Wait, but I don't know where A and C are. However, if I can express coordinates of A and C in terms of B.\n\nEarlier, when I set B at (0,0), A at (0,6), C at (2,0), then midpoint of AC is (1, 3). The slope of AC is (0 - 6)/(2 - 0) = -3. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector has slope 1/3. Equation: y - 3 = (1/3)(x - 1). Therefore, O lies somewhere on this line. Earlier solutions for O(-5,1) and (7,5): check if they lie on this line.\n\nFor O(-5,1):\n\nLeft side: y - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2\n\nRight side: (1/3)(-5 - 1) = (1/3)(-6) = -2. Yes, satisfies.\n\nFor O(7,5):\n\nLeft side: y - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nRight side: (1/3)(7 - 1) = (1/3)(6) = 2. Yes, also satisfies. So both centers lie on the perpendicular bisector of AC, as they should.\n\nBut how else can we determine which one?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that in the Asymptote code, the arc is drawn from A to C, so the center should be such that the arc from A to C is the one that forms the notch. If O is at (-5,1), then the arc from A(0,6) to C(2,0) would be the shorter arc or longer arc? Let me compute the angle AOC.\n\nFor O(-5,1), A(0,6), C(2,0). Compute vectors OA and OC.\n\nVector OA: from O(-5,1) to A(0,6): (5, 5)\n\nVector OC: from O(-5,1) to C(2,0): (7, -1)\n\nCompute the angle between OA and OC. The dot product:\n\n(5)(7) + (5)(-1) = 35 - 5 = 30\n\n|OA| = sqrt(5² + 5²) = sqrt(50)\n\n|OC| = sqrt(7² + (-1)^2) = sqrt(50)\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) = 30 / (sqrt(50)*sqrt(50)) = 30 / 50 = 3/5. Therefore, theta ≈ 53.13 degrees. Therefore, the arc from A to C is about 53 degrees, which is less than 180, so minor arc. Therefore, the arc drawn from A to C would be the minor arc, which makes sense for a notch. If O were at (7,5), let's compute angle AOC.\n\nFor O(7,5), A(0,6), C(2,0). Vectors OA: from O(7,5) to A(0,6): (-7, 1)\n\nVector OC: from O(7,5) to C(2,0): (-5, -5)\n\nDot product: (-7)(-5) + (1)(-5) = 35 - 5 = 30\n\n|OA| = sqrt( (-7)^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(49 + 1) = sqrt(50)\n\n|OC| = sqrt( (-5)^2 + (-5)^2 ) = sqrt(50)\n\nSame as before, cos(theta) = 30/50 = 3/5, so angle is same ≈53.13 degrees. Therefore, arc from A to C is also minor arc. So both positions of O give minor arc from A to C. Therefore, still can't determine based on that.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, the arc is drawn from A to C, and in their code, O is at (0,0). In their code, point A is at dir(45), and point C is on the horizontal line from B. Given that, maybe the center is located such that the notch is on one side. Given that in our coordinate system with B at (0,0), O at (-5,1) is on the opposite side of A relative to B, whereas O at (7,5) is on the opposite side of C relative to B. Depending on the diagram.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another condition. Let me think about the position of point C. In our coordinate system, with B at (0,0), C is at (2,0). For O at (-5,1), the line from B(0,0) to C(2,0) is along positive x-axis. The center is at (-5,1), which is to the left and above B. Therefore, the arc from A(0,6) to C(2,0) would curve downwards and to the right, passing near the center? Wait, the center is at (-5,1). The arc from A(0,6) to C(2,0) with center at (-5,1). Let me imagine this. The circle is centered far to the left of point A and below it. The arc from A to C would swing around to the right, passing through C(2,0). This seems plausible for a notch.\n\nIf the center is at (7,5), then the circle is centered far to the right and above. The arc from A(0,6) to C(2,0) would swing around to the left? Wait, but point C is at (2,0), which is to the right of B. If the center is at (7,5), then the arc from A(0,6) to C(2,0) would curve to the right? Wait, let me calculate another point on the circle. For example, with O(7,5), the circle includes A(0,6) and C(2,0). Let me check another point, say, the topmost point of the circle. The center is at (7,5), radius sqrt(50). The topmost point would be at (7, 5 + sqrt(50)*sin(theta)), but maybe it's easier to note that since A(0,6) is on the circle, and center at (7,5), the direction from O to A is (-7, 1). Similarly, direction from O to C is (-5, -5). The arc from A to C would go clockwise or counterclockwise? Depending on the orientation. Given that the Asymptote code draws an arc from A to C, probably in a particular direction. Without seeing the diagram, it's hard, but given that in our first case with O(-5,1), the arc from A(0,6) to C(2,0) would pass below the center, creating a notch at B, which is inside. In the other case, with O(7,5), the arc from A to C would pass above the center? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a property or another equation I can use to determine which one is correct. Wait, maybe considering that in the Asymptote code, after defining point C as intersection of B--(B.x + r, B.y) with the circle. In our case, with B at (0,0), and trying to find C as intersection of horizontal line from B (i.e., y=0) going to the right (positive x-axis) with the circle. Wait, in our coordinate system, point C is at (2, 0). Let me check if this lies on the horizontal line from B(0,0). Yes, since C is at (2, 0). Now, let me check if this point lies on both circles.\n\nFor O(-5,1): distance from O(-5,1) to C(2,0): sqrt( (2 + 5)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 ) = sqrt(49 + 1) = sqrt(50). Correct.\n\nFor O(7,5): distance from O(7,5) to C(2,0): sqrt( (2 - 7)^2 + (0 - 5)^2 ) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50). Correct.\n\nTherefore, both centers are valid. However, in the Asymptote code, point C is defined as intersectionpoint(B--(B.x + r, B.y), P). In our case, B is at (0,0), and the horizontal line from B is the x-axis. The intersection with the circle would be two points: C and possibly another point on the opposite side. But since they take the one going towards B.x + r, which in their code is to the right. In our case, with B at (0,0), and horizontal line to the right (positive x-axis), intersection with the circle would be at (something, 0). For O(-5,1), solving circle equation:\n\n(x + 5)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 50\n\nOn y = 0:\n\n(x + 5)^2 + 1 = 50 ⇒ (x + 5)^2 = 49 ⇒ x + 5 = ±7 ⇒ x = 2 or x = -12. Therefore, points (2,0) and (-12, 0). Since they take the one going to the right from B(0,0), it's (2,0). Similarly, for O(7,5):\n\n(x - 7)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 50\n\nOn y = 0:\n\n(x - 7)^2 + 25 = 50 ⇒ (x - 7)^2 = 25 ⇒ x - 7 = ±5 ⇒ x = 12 or x = 2. Therefore, points (12, 0) and (2, 0). Again, taking the one to the right from B(0,0) is (2, 0). Wait, so in both cases, point C is at (2,0). Therefore, both centers are possible? But in the Asymptote code, they define A at dir(45), which in their case corresponds to our point A(0,6) only if the center is at (-5,1). Because in their code, A is at dir(45) which is 45 degrees from the origin. In our coordinate system, with O at (-5,1), point A(0,6) is at 45 degrees from O(-5,1). Whereas with O at (7,5), point A(0,6) is not at 45 degrees. Therefore, the Asymptote code's construction suggests that O is at (-5,1), because A is at dir(45). Therefore, this must be the correct center. Therefore, the answer is 26.\n\nTherefore, I think the square of the distance from B to the center is 26 cm², so the answer is \\boxed{26}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{26}\n</think>"}
