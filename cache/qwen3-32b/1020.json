The question is about disinfectants and their active ingredients, specifically which one is a salt. The options are Potassium permanganate, Peracetic acid, Hydrogen peroxide, and Medical alcohol.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these substances is chemically. A salt is typically an ionic compound formed from the neutralization reaction of an acid and a base. So, if the active ingredient is a salt, it should be composed of a cation and an anion.\n\nStarting with option A: Potassium permanganate. I remember that potassium permanganate is KMnO4. Potassium is a metal, and permanganate is a polyatomic ion (MnO4^-). So this is definitely a salt because it's a combination of a metal cation and a polyatomic anion. That makes sense.\n\nOption B: Peracetic acid. The name itself includes \"acid,\" which suggests it's an acid, not a salt. Peracetic acid is CH3COOOH, I think. Acids typically donate protons, so they are not salts. So this is probably not the answer.\n\nOption C: Hydrogen peroxide. Its formula is H2O2. It's a compound but not an ionic compound. It's a covalent molecule, so not a salt. So this is out.\n\nOption D: Medical alcohol. Medical alcohol is usually ethanol, C2H5OH. Again, a covalent compound, not a salt. So that's not it either.\n\nSo the only one that fits the definition of a salt is option A, Potassium permanganate. Let me just double-check. Potassium permanganate is indeed a salt, as it's composed of K+ and MnO4^- ions. The others are acids or covalent compounds. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>"}
