It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In equation form, it is often written as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy,\n- $Q$ is the heat added to the system,\n- $W$ is the work done by the system.\n\nLet's now analyze each option in light of the first law:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A**:\n> *The working process of a refrigerator shows that heat can be transferred from a cooler object to a warmer object.*\n\nThis statement is **factually correct**—refrigerators do transfer heat from a cooler interior to a warmer exterior. However, this process is not a **direct consequence of the first law**, but rather **allowed by it**. The first law ensures that the total energy is conserved (i.e., the heat removed from the interior plus the work input equals the heat expelled to the exterior), but it does **not address the direction of heat flow**. That is governed by the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, which introduces the concept of entropy and the need for work to reverse natural heat flow.\n\nThus, while the statement is **true**, it is **more closely associated with the second law**. Therefore, it is **not the best choice** for a question specifically asking about the **first law**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B**:\n> *During the cooling process of an air conditioner, the heat absorbed from indoors is less than the heat released outdoors.*\n\nThis is **directly a consequence of the first law**. In air conditioning, the heat extracted from the indoor air ($Q_{\\text{in}}$) is combined with the work input ($W$) to produce the heat expelled to the outdoors ($Q_{\\text{out}}$):\n\n$$\nQ_{\\text{out}} = Q_{\\text{in}} + W\n$$\n\nThis clearly shows that the **heat released outdoors is greater** than the heat absorbed from indoors, and this is a **direct application of the first law of energy conservation**. Therefore, this statement is **correct according to the first law**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C**:\n> *Advances in technology can make internal combustion engines become heat engines with a single heat source.*\n\nThis is **incorrect**. According to the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, no heat engine can operate with a **single heat source** and convert all heat into work. Heat engines require a **temperature difference** between a hot and cold reservoir to function. Even with advances in technology, this is a fundamental thermodynamic limit. Hence, this statement is **not supported by the first law** and is **factually incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D**:\n> *Excessive consumption of energy will cause the energy in nature to continually decrease, leading to an energy crisis.*\n\nThis is **also incorrect**. The **First Law of Thermodynamics** states that **energy is conserved**—it cannot be created or destroyed. However, energy can be transformed into less usable forms (e.g., into heat dispersed in the environment), which is a concept related to the **Second Law of Thermodynamics** (entropy). The statement in D incorrectly suggests that total energy is decreasing, which **violates the first law**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\n\nAmong all the options, **Option B** is the **only one that is directly and unambiguously supported by the first law of thermodynamics**. It demonstrates a clear application of energy conservation in a thermodynamic system (an air conditioner), where the heat expelled is greater than the heat absorbed due to the addition of work input.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this question step by step. The question is about the first law of thermodynamics and which statement among the options is correct. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the first law of thermodynamics states. From what I remember, the first law is essentially the law of conservation of energy applied to thermodynamics. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. In equation form, it's usually written as ΔU = Q - W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system. \n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: \"The working process of a refrigerator shows that heat can be transferred from a cooler object to a warmer object.\" Hmm, I know that refrigerators work by moving heat from the inside (which is cooler) to the outside (which is warmer). But wait, doesn't the second law of thermodynamics say that heat naturally flows from hot to cold, and that to reverse this, work must be done? The first law is about conservation of energy, while the second law deals with the direction of heat flow. So, the refrigerator does transfer heat from a cooler to a warmer object, but this requires work input. The first law would account for the energy, but the second law explains why it's possible with work. So, the statement in A is correct in that it's possible with a refrigerator, but does this relate directly to the first law? Maybe not. The first law is about energy conservation, so the refrigerator's process would involve energy transfer (work and heat) in such a way that energy is conserved. But the statement itself is about the direction of heat transfer, which is more about the second law. However, the first law doesn't prohibit heat transfer from cold to hot if work is done. So maybe A is correct in the context of the first law because it's showing that energy is conserved (work is done to move heat against the temperature gradient). \n\nOption B: \"During the cooling process of an air conditioner, the heat absorbed from indoors is less than the heat released outdoors.\" Let's think. An air conditioner removes heat from the indoor air and releases it outside. The heat released outdoors should be equal to the heat absorbed indoors plus the work done by the air conditioner. Because the work done by the compressor (which is electrical work) is converted into heat and added to the outdoor heat. So, if Q_in is the heat absorbed from indoors, and W is the work input, then the heat released outdoors Q_out = Q_in + W. Therefore, Q_out should be greater than Q_in. So the statement in B says that the heat absorbed from indoors is less than the heat released outdoors. That would mean Q_in < Q_out, which is true. So this statement is correct. But how does this relate to the first law? The first law would state that the energy is conserved, so the heat released is the sum of the heat absorbed and the work done. So B is a correct statement according to the first law.\n\nOption C: \"Advances in technology can make internal combustion engines become heat engines with a single heat source.\" Wait, heat engines require a temperature difference between a hot reservoir and a cold reservoir to convert heat into work. The second law of thermodynamics (Carnot's theorem) states that no heat engine can be 100% efficient, and they must have a cold reservoir to reject waste heat. So a heat engine with a single heat source would violate the second law because you can't convert all the heat into work without a cold reservoir. The first law doesn't prevent this because it's about conservation, but the second law does. So even with technological advances, this isn't possible. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Excessive consumption of energy will cause the energy in nature to continually decrease, leading to an energy crisis.\" The first law says energy is conserved, so it can't be created or destroyed. However, energy can be transformed into less useful forms (like heat dispersed into the environment), which relates to the second law (entropy). So while the total energy in the universe remains constant, the usable energy decreases. However, the statement in D says energy in nature will decrease, which is a misunderstanding. The total energy doesn't decrease, but the usable energy does. So the energy crisis is about the availability of usable energy, not the total energy. Therefore, statement D is incorrect because it's conflating energy conservation with energy availability. The first law doesn't support the idea that energy is being \"used up\" in the sense of decreasing total energy.\n\nSo reviewing the options:\n\nA: Correct in that heat can be transferred from cold to hot with work, but this is more about the second law. However, the first law allows it as long as energy is conserved (work is done). The statement itself is factually correct, but is it directly a consequence of the first law? Maybe not. The first law doesn't address the direction, just the conservation.\n\nB: Correct, because the heat released outdoors is more than the heat absorbed indoors, which is a direct result of energy conservation (first law) since work is added.\n\nC: Incorrect, as per second law.\n\nD: Incorrect, because energy isn't decreasing, just becoming less usable.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the question is according to the first law of thermodynamics. So which of these statements is correct according to the first law?\n\nOption A: The refrigerator's process shows heat can be transferred from cooler to warmer. The first law doesn't prohibit this as long as energy is conserved. The process does require work, which is accounted for in the first law. So the statement is correct in that it's possible with work, and the first law allows it because energy is conserved (work is done). So A is correct in the context of the first law.\n\nBut B is also correct according to the first law. Wait, but the question is which of the options is correct according to the first law. So maybe both A and B are correct? But the options are A to D, and the answer is one of them. Wait, the original question is in Chinese, but the options are labeled A to D, and the user is asking which is correct according to the first law.\n\nWait, let me check again. The first law is conservation of energy. So for option A, the refrigerator transferring heat from cold to hot requires work. The first law allows this because the energy from the work is added. So the statement in A is correct. But the first law doesn't say anything about the direction of heat transfer; that's the second law. However, the statement in A is correct because it's possible with work, and the first law allows it. So A is correct.\n\nOption B: The heat absorbed from indoors is less than the heat released outdoors. This is true because Q_out = Q_in + W. Therefore, Q_out > Q_in, so the statement is correct. This is a direct application of the first law. So B is also correct.\n\nBut the options are A, B, C, D. The question is which is correct according to the first law. If both A and B are correct, but the options are single choice, then there's a problem. However, in the original question, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Chinese exams, sometimes the options are designed so that only one is correct. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption A: The refrigerator's process shows that heat can be transferred from a cooler to a warmer object. This is true, but the first law doesn't say anything about the direction. The first law is about conservation. So the refrigerator's process is allowed by the first law because energy is conserved (work is done). But the statement is about the direction of heat transfer, which is more about the second law. However, the first law allows it as long as energy is conserved. So the statement in A is correct, but does it directly follow from the first law? Maybe not. The first law doesn't prohibit it, but the statement is about the process being possible, which is allowed by the first law. So maybe A is correct according to the first law.\n\nOption B: The heat absorbed from indoors is less than the heat released outdoors. This is correct because Q_out = Q_in + W. Therefore, Q_out > Q_in, so the statement is correct. This is a direct consequence of the first law, which requires that energy is conserved. So B is correct.\n\nSo if both A and B are correct, but the options are single choice, then there's a mistake. However, perhaps in the original question, only one is correct. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a nuance. For example, the first law is about conservation, so in the case of a refrigerator, the energy input (work) plus the heat from the inside equals the heat expelled outside. So the process is allowed by the first law. Therefore, the statement in A is correct in that it's possible, which is allowed by the first law. However, the statement in B is also correct. \n\nBut in some cases, the options might have only one correct answer. Let me check if there's any mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, the first law is ΔU = Q - W (or ΔU = Q + W depending on the sign convention). For a refrigerator, it's a heat pump. The work done on the system (refrigerator) is W. The heat removed from the cold reservoir is Q_c, and the heat expelled to the hot reservoir is Q_h. The first law for the refrigerator would be Q_h = Q_c + W. So the heat expelled is greater than the heat removed. Therefore, B is correct. So the statement in B is correct according to the first law.\n\nBut the statement in A is also correct. However, the question is which is correct according to the first law. If both A and B are correct, but the options are A to D with only one correct answer, then perhaps the intended answer is B. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the question is from a Chinese exam where the options are designed such that only one is correct. Let me check again.\n\nOption A: The refrigerator's process shows that heat can be transferred from a cooler to a warmer object. This is correct, but the first law doesn't say anything about the direction. The first law allows it because energy is conserved. But the statement is about the process being possible, which is allowed by the first law. However, the first law doesn't state that heat can be transferred from cold to hot; it just says energy is conserved. So the statement in A is correct in that it's possible with work, which is allowed by the first law. So A is correct.\n\nOption B: The heat absorbed from indoors is less than the heat released outdoors. This is correct because of the first law (energy conservation). \n\nSo if both A and B are correct, but the options are A-D with only one answer, there must be something wrong. However, perhaps the options are designed so that only one is correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first law is about conservation of energy. So for the refrigerator (option A), the process is allowed by the first law because energy is conserved (work is done). So the statement in A is correct according to the first law. However, the statement in A is about the direction of heat transfer, which is more about the second law. The first law allows it, but doesn't state it. So maybe the question is testing whether the student knows that the first law allows such a process with work, making A correct. \n\nBut in the case of B, the statement is directly a consequence of the first law. So both A and B are correct according to the first law. However, if the options are single choice, perhaps there's a mistake in the question, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are designed to have only one correct answer. Let me think again.\n\nThe first law says energy is conserved. So for option B, the heat released is more than the heat absorbed because work is added. This is a direct application of the first law. So B is correct.\n\nFor option A, the refrigerator's process is possible because work is done, which is allowed by the first law. So the statement is correct. But the first law doesn't say anything about the direction of heat transfer. However, the statement in A is correct in that it's possible with work, which is allowed by the first law. So A is correct.\n\nBut in the options, if both A and B are correct, but the question is from a test where only one is correct, perhaps there's a trick. Let me check if any of the options are incorrect.\n\nOption C: Advances in technology can make internal combustion engines become heat engines with a single heat source. This is impossible according to the second law (Carnot's theorem), so C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: Excessive consumption of energy will cause the energy in nature to continually decrease. This is incorrect because energy is conserved (first law), so the total energy doesn't decrease. The problem is with usable energy, not total energy. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, between A and B, both are correct according to the first law. But the options are A to D, and the user is asking for the answer. Maybe in the original question, the correct answer is B, but I need to check why.\n\nWait, perhaps the first law is about energy conservation, so for the refrigerator, the process is allowed by the first law, but the statement in A is about the direction of heat transfer, which is not a direct consequence of the first law. The first law allows it, but the statement is about the process being possible, which is allowed by the first law. So A is correct.\n\nBut the statement in B is directly a consequence of the first law (Q_out = Q_in + W). So both A and B are correct. But the options are A-D, and the user is expecting one answer. This is confusing. However, in some cases, the options may have only one correct answer. Let me check if there's any other consideration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the correct answer is B. Let me think again.\n\nThe first law is about energy conservation. So for the refrigerator, the energy input (work) plus the heat from the inside equals the heat expelled outside. Therefore, the heat expelled is greater than the heat removed. So B is correct. \n\nThe statement in A is correct in that heat can be transferred from cold to hot with work, but the first law doesn't state that; it's the second law that allows it with work. However, the first law allows it as long as energy is conserved. So the statement in A is correct according to the first law because it's allowed by energy conservation. \n\nBut the question is which statement is correct according to the first law. Both A and B are correct. However, in some exams, the intended answer might be B because it's a direct application of the first law's energy conservation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are designed so that only one is correct. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A says the refrigerator shows that heat can be transferred from cooler to warmer. This is correct, but the first law doesn't say anything about the direction of heat transfer. The first law allows it as long as energy is conserved. So the statement in A is correct, but it's more about the second law. \n\nOption B is directly a consequence of the first law. So if the question is which is correct according to the first law, then B is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n</think>"}
