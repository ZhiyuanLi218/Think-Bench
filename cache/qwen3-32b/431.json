The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling what the partition function is. The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the system of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). \n\nSince there are three spins, each with two possible states, the total number of possible configurations is 2^3 = 8. So I need to list all 8 possible configurations, calculate the energy for each, then compute e^(-βE) for each, and sum them all up. Then see which option matches.\n\nLet me start by listing all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. Let me make a table:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nNow for each of these, compute E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nStarting with configuration 1: All +1.\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 1+1+1=3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J. Therefore, the Boltzmann factor is e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3Jβ}.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait the energy is E = -J[...], so when I compute e^{-βE}, that would be e^{-β*(-J[...])} = e^{βJ[...]}. Let me check again.\n\nYes, because E is negative of J times the sum. So E = -J*(sum). Therefore, -βE = βJ*(sum). Therefore, each Boltzmann factor is e^{βJ*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}. Maybe that's easier to compute. Let me recast.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute E for each configuration, then compute e^{-βE}.\n\nLet me try both ways. For configuration 1:\n\nE = -J*(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J. Then e^{-βE} = e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}.\n\nSame as before. Let me do this for all 8 configurations.\n\nConfiguration 1: All +1. E = -3J. Boltzmann factor e^{3βJ}.\n\nConfiguration 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nCompute S1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1, S1S3=(+1)(-1)=-1, S2S3=(+1)(-1)=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Therefore, E = -J*(-1) = +J. Then e^{-βE} = e^{-βJ}.\n\nConfiguration 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = +J. e^{-βE} = e^{-βJ}.\n\nConfiguration 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = +J. e^{-βE} = e^{-βJ}.\n\nConfiguration 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nSimilarly symmetric to configuration 2 and 3. Let me compute:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1)=-1, S1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3=(+1)(+1)=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Same as configuration 4. So E = +J, e^{-βE} = e^{-βJ}.\n\nConfiguration 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1)=-1, S1S3=(-1)(-1)=+1, S2S3=(+1)(-1)=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = +J. e^{-βE} = e^{-βJ}.\n\nConfiguration 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (+1), since (-1)(-1)=+1, S1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1. Sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. E = +J. e^{-βE} = e^{-βJ}.\n\nConfiguration 8: All -1. S1=S2=S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum is 1+1+1=3. Therefore, E = -J*(3) = -3J. Then e^{-βE} = e^{3βJ}.\n\nSo now, let's tally up the Boltzmann factors:\n\nConfigurations 1 and 8 contribute e^{3βJ} each. So total from these two is 2e^{3βJ}.\n\nThe other six configurations (2,3,4,5,6,7) each contribute e^{-βJ}. So total from them is 6e^{-βJ}.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nA: 2e^{2Jβ} + 6e^{-2Jβ}\n\nB: 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ} \n\nC: 2e^{-3Jβ} + 6e^{Jβ}\n\nD: 6e^{2Jβ} + 2e^{-2Jβ}\n\nSo my result is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}, which is exactly option B. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOption B says Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ). Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me verify the energies again for each configuration. For configurations where all spins are same (all +1 or all -1), the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is 3, so E=-3J. For all other configurations, which are six in number, the sum is -1, so E = -J*(-1) = +J? Wait hold on, let me check again:\n\nWait E is -J multiplied by the sum. So if the sum is -1, then E = -J*(-1) = +J. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, e^{-βE} is e^{-β*(+J)} = e^{-βJ}.\n\nTherefore, yes, the six configurations with two +1 and one -1 or two -1 and one +1, they all have sum -1. Wait, is that correct? Let me check configuration 2 again:\n\nConfiguration 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct. Similarly for configuration 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. Correct. Similarly for others. Therefore, yes, all six middle configurations have sum -1, so E= +J. Therefore, their Boltzmann factor is e^{-βJ}. Therefore, total Z is 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}, which is option B. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA: 2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ}\n\nB: 2 e^{3Jβ}+6e^{-Jβ}\n\nC: 2 e^{-3Jβ}+6e^{Jβ}\n\nD: 6e^{2Jβ}+2e^{-2Jβ}\n\nYes, so option B is correct. But let me check if I made any mistake in the energy expression. The energy is given by E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\n\nAnother way to think about this: Each pair interaction. For three spins, there are three pairs: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3. Each pair contributes -J S_i S_j, so total energy would be sum over pairs of -J S_i S_j. Which is exactly what is given here. So E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in Ising model, people write E = J S1 S2 S3 or something else, but here it's pairwise. So calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me think about what possible values this sum can take. Each term is product of two spins, which can be +1 or -1. Let me think:\n\nIf all three spins are same, say +1: each product is +1, so sum is 3.\n\nIf two are +1 and one is -1: Let's take S1=S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Similarly for other permutations. If two are -1 and one is +1: Let me take S1=S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is again 1 -1 -1 = -1. If all three are -1, then each product is +1, sum is 3. Therefore, the sum can be either 3 or -1. Therefore, the energy E can be -3J or +J. Therefore, the partition function Z = (number of states with sum 3)*e^{β*3J} + (number of states with sum -1)*e^{β*J} ?\n\nWait wait no. Wait E is -J*(sum). Therefore, if sum is 3, E = -3J. If sum is -1, E = +J. Therefore, the Boltzmann factor is e^{-βE} which is e^{-β*(-3J)}= e^{3βJ} for sum=3, and e^{-β*(+J)}=e^{-βJ} for sum=-1. Therefore, yes, exactly as I calculated. Therefore, since there are 2 states with sum=3 (all +1 and all -1) and 6 states with sum=-1, Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}. Which is option B. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are written as:\n\nA: 2e^(2Jβ) +6e^(-2Jβ)\n\nB: 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\n\nC: 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nD: 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nYes, so option B is correct. Therefore, the answer should be B. \n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of states? Let me check again. How many states have all spins same? There are two: all +1 and all -1. The rest 8-2=6 have two spins one way and one the other. Therefore, yes, 6 states with two +1 and one -1 or two -1 and one +1. Therefore, correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another approach. Let me think. Maybe using some symmetry or mathematical manipulation. For example, writing the partition function as sum over all S1, S2, S3 of e^{βJ(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}. Since E = -J(...), so e^{-βE} = e^{βJ(...)}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can relate this to something else. For example, for three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be written in terms of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 or something? Let me recall that (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each Si is ±1, their squares are 1. Therefore:\n\n(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, solving for the sum:\n\nS1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the exponent:\n\nβJ(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = βJ [ (M^2 - 3)/2 ] where M = S1 + S2 + S3.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z = sum_{all states} exp[ βJ (M² - 3)/2 ].\n\nBut maybe this complicates things more. However, let me see if this helps. Let's compute M for each state. For the all +1 state, M = 3. For the all -1 state, M = -3. For states with two +1 and one -1, M = 2 -1 = 1. For states with two -1 and one +1, M = -2 +1 = -1. \n\nTherefore, let's compute for each case:\n\nCase 1: M=3 or M=-3. Then M²=9. Then exponent is βJ*(9 - 3)/2 = βJ*(6)/2 = 3βJ. So e^{3βJ} for each of these states. There are 2 states (all +1 and all -1).\n\nCase 2: M=1 or M=-1. Then M²=1. Exponent is βJ*(1 - 3)/2 = βJ*(-2)/2 = -βJ. So e^{-βJ} for each of these states. How many states have M=1 or M=-1? For M=1: two +1 and one -1. There are C(3,2)=3 states with two +1 and one -1. Similarly, three states with two -1 and one +1, which have M=-1. So total of 6 states. Therefore, same result as before: Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}. So same conclusion. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nTherefore, I think confidently the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
