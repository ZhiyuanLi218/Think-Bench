A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances with different chemical properties. In contrast, a **physical change** involves changes in physical properties (e.g., state, shape, size) without the formation of new substances.\n\n---\n\n### **Option A**  \n> **\"Shendan can transform iron into copper\" recorded in \"Shen Nong's Herbal Classic\"**\n\nThis statement appears to describe a transformation of **iron into copper**. While alchemy historically attempted to perform such changes, **chemical processes cannot transform one element into another**. However, it's possible the statement refers to a **chemical reaction** in which copper is **extracted** from a compound using iron (e.g., a **displacement reaction** like Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu). In such a case, iron is **not turned into copper**, but copper is produced as a result of a **chemical reaction**. Therefore, this **involves a chemical change**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B**  \n> **Preparation of soda ash using the \"Hou's ammonia-soda process\"**\n\nThe **Hou's process** is a well-known **chemical method** for producing **sodium carbonate (soda ash)** from sodium chloride, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. This involves multiple **chemical reactions**, including the formation of **sodium bicarbonate** and its subsequent thermal decomposition. This is a **clear example of a chemical change**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C**  \n> **Scientists successfully convert CO₂ into starch or glucose**\n\nThis statement refers to **chemical synthesis** or **biochemical fixation** of carbon dioxide into **organic molecules** like **starch or glucose**, which are **new substances** with different chemical properties than CO₂. This process is a **chemical change**, as new chemical bonds are formed.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D**  \n> **Beijing Winter Olympic venues use CO₂ transcritical direct cooling for ice-making**\n\nThis process involves **CO₂ being used as a refrigerant** in a **transcritical cycle**, where it undergoes **phase changes** (e.g., gas to liquid and back to gas) under high pressure. However, **CO₂ remains CO₂** throughout the process. There is **no formation of new substances**—only **physical changes in state** and **thermodynamic conditions**. This is a **physical process**, not a chemical one.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAmong the four options, only **Option D** describes a process that **does not involve a chemical change**, as it is based purely on **phase transitions** and **thermodynamics** of CO₂, with no new substances being formed.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Correct Answer: (D)**  \n**Beijing Winter Olympic venues use CO₂ transcritical direct cooling for ice-making.**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these options does not involve a chemical change. Let me start by recalling what a chemical change is. A chemical change is when a substance undergoes a transformation to form one or more new substances with different chemical properties. This is different from a physical change, which doesn't produce new substances and is usually reversible, like melting ice or dissolving sugar in water.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: \"Shendan can transform iron into copper\" from \"Shen Nong's Herbal Classic.\" Hmm, Shendan might refer to alchemy or traditional Chinese alchemy. Transforming iron into copper sounds like a change in the elemental composition, which would require a nuclear reaction, not a chemical one. But wait, in ancient times, they might have thought they could do this through chemical processes. But actually, changing one element into another isn't possible through ordinary chemical reactions. So if this is a chemical process, then it's impossible, but maybe they were referring to something else? Or maybe it's a metaphor? But the question is about whether it involves a chemical change. Since transforming elements would require nuclear changes, not chemical, maybe this is a physical change or no change? But if they're claiming a transformation from iron to copper, which are different elements, that's not a chemical change. So maybe A is the answer? But I need to check the other options.\n\nOption B: Preparation of soda ash using the Hou's ammonia-soda process. Soda ash is sodium carbonate. The Hou's process is a method of producing sodium carbonate, which involves chemical reactions. For example, it's a chemical process where ammonia, carbon dioxide, and sodium chloride are used to produce sodium bicarbonate, which is then heated to form sodium carbonate. So this definitely involves chemical changes as new substances are formed.\n\nOption C: Scientists convert CO2 into starch or glucose. Converting carbon dioxide into starch or glucose would involve biochemical or chemical processes where CO2 is fixed into organic molecules. This is a chemical change because new substances (starch/glucose) are formed from CO2. For example, photosynthesis is a similar process, but here it's done by scientists, maybe through some catalytic or synthetic methods. Definitely a chemical change.\n\nOption D: Beijing Winter Olympic venues use CO2 transcritical direct cooling for ice-making. Transcritical direct cooling refers to a thermodynamic process where CO2 is used as a refrigerant. In this process, CO2 undergoes phase changes (from gas to liquid and back) under high pressure, but it doesn't change chemically. The CO2 remains CO2; it's just changing states or pressure conditions. So this is a physical change, not a chemical one. Therefore, D might be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. Let me double-check. The question asks which statements do not involve chemical changes. So if D is a physical change, then it's the correct answer. But what about A?\n\nIn option A, if they are trying to transform iron into copper through alchemy, which is supposed to be a chemical process, but in reality, it's impossible chemically. However, if the statement is recorded as a belief or a claim, but in reality, if such a transformation were possible, would it be chemical? But since elements can't be changed by chemical means, it's impossible. However, the question is about whether the process described in the statement involves a chemical change. If the statement is about a process that they believed was a chemical transformation, but in reality, it's not possible, but maybe in the context of the question, we have to take the statement at face value. If they say they transformed iron into copper, even if it's not possible, does that count as a chemical change? Or since changing elements requires nuclear reactions, which are not chemical changes, then even if they thought it was a chemical change, the actual process (if it were real) would not be a chemical change. But the question is about the statements as described. If the statement is about a chemical process that transforms iron into copper, but in reality, it's impossible, but perhaps in the context of the question, we need to evaluate based on whether the process as described involves a chemical change. Since changing elements isn't a chemical change, then A does not involve a chemical change. However, maybe in ancient times, they thought that they were performing a chemical process, but in reality, if they were just alloying or coating iron with copper, that would be a physical change. But the statement says \"transform iron into copper,\" which implies creating copper from iron. So if that's the case, then it's not a chemical change. So A and D both do not involve chemical changes? But the options are A, B, C, D. The question says \"the following statements do not involve chemical changes,\" so there might be more than one, but the options are single choice? Wait, the user hasn't specified if it's multiple choice or single choice, but the way the question is presented, it's likely one correct answer. Let me check again.\n\nOption D: CO2 transcritical direct cooling for ice-making. This is a physical process where CO2 is used as a refrigerant, undergoing phase changes but no chemical change. So D is a physical change. So D is a candidate.\n\nOption A: If they are claiming to transform iron into copper, which is impossible through chemical means. So if the process described is impossible chemically, then it's not a chemical change. But maybe the process is a metaphor or refers to something else. For example, maybe they were coating iron with copper through electroplating, which is a chemical process. But the statement says \"transform iron into copper,\" which would mean the iron becomes copper. If that's the case, then no chemical process can do that; that's nuclear transmutation. So in that case, the statement doesn't involve a chemical change. Therefore, A and D are the options that don't involve chemical changes. But the options given are A, B, C, D. The question is in Chinese context, maybe. The original options are (A) through (D). The question is likely a single answer. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the original question says \"the following statements do not involve chemical changes.\" So which of the four options is the one that doesn't involve a chemical change. If both A and D are candidates, but maybe the answer is D. Let me think again.\n\nOption A: \"Shendan can transform iron into copper\" – if this refers to a chemical process as described in an ancient text, but in reality, it's impossible. However, if the process they were using involved some chemical reactions that resulted in copper being produced from iron (e.g., through a displacement reaction where iron is used to get copper from copper sulfate solution), then it would be a chemical change. But the statement says \"transform iron into copper,\" which might imply that the iron is turned into copper, which would require a chemical change? Wait, no. In a displacement reaction, iron can displace copper from a copper salt solution, resulting in copper metal being deposited. In that case, iron is oxidized to Fe²+ and copper is reduced to Cu. The iron is converted into a compound (FeSO4 if it's copper sulfate), and copper metal is produced. So the iron is not transformed into copper; instead, copper ions are reduced to copper metal, and iron is oxidized. So the statement might be a misinterpretation or a poetic way of saying that they can obtain copper from iron through a chemical reaction. In that case, there is a chemical change involved. So option A might involve a chemical change. Therefore, the answer might be D.\n\nSo D is the one that doesn't involve a chemical change because it's a physical process (phase changes of CO2), while A involves a chemical reaction where copper is obtained from a compound using iron. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
