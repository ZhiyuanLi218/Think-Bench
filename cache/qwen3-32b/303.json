Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Isotopes of Chlorine**: Chlorine has two main isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. These isotopes have different masses due to varying numbers of neutrons in their nuclei.\n\n2. **Natural Abundance**: The isotopes do not occur in equal proportions. Chlorine-35 is more abundant (about 75.53%), while chlorine-37 is less abundant (about 24.47%).\n\n3. **Weighted Average Calculation**: To calculate the atomic mass, each isotope's mass is multiplied by its relative abundance (expressed as a decimal), and the results are summed:\n   $$\n   \\text{Atomic Mass} = (0.7553 \\times 35) + (0.2447 \\times 37) \\approx 26.4355 + 9.0539 = 35.4894 \\, \\text{amu}.\n   $$\n   This value is close to the reported atomic mass of 35.45 amu, confirming the validity of this method.\n\n4. **Elimination of Other Options**:\n   - **Option B** (Sum of isotope masses: 35 + 37 = 72 amu) is incorrect because atomic mass is not a sum but a weighted average.\n   - **Option C** (Equal distribution: 36 amu) ignores the actual abundance, which favors the lighter isotope.\n   - **Option D** (Predominant isotope mass: 35 amu) is incorrect because the atomic mass reflects contributions from all isotopes, not just the most abundant one.\n\n**Answer**: **A: Weighted average of isotopes: (0.7553×35 + 0.2447×37) amu = 35.46 amu**.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking why chlorine has an atomic mass of approximately 35.45 amu. The options are A, B, C, and D. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that atomic mass on the periodic table isn't just the mass of one isotope; it's an average of all the isotopes of that element, weighted by their natural abundance. So chlorine has different isotopes, right? The most common ones are chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. \n\nLooking at the options, option A says it's a weighted average of isotopes, calculating 0.7553 times 35 plus 0.2447 times 37. Let me check that. If those percentages are the abundances, then multiplying each isotope's mass by its abundance and adding them up would give the average. Let me do the math quickly. \n\n35 times 0.7553 is... 35 * 0.7553. Let me calculate that. 35 * 0.7 is 24.5, 35 * 0.05 is 1.75, 35 * 0.0053 is about 0.1855. Adding those together: 24.5 + 1.75 = 26.25 + 0.1855 ≈ 26.4355. Then 37 times 0.2447. Let's see, 37 * 0.2 is 7.4, 37 * 0.04 is 1.48, 37 * 0.0047 is approximately 0.1739. Adding those: 7.4 + 1.48 = 8.88 + 0.1739 ≈ 9.0539. Then adding 26.4355 + 9.0539 ≈ 35.4894 amu. The question states the atomic mass is 35.45 amu, so this answer is very close. That seems right. \n\nOption B says it's the sum of isotope masses, 35 + 37 = 72. That doesn't make sense because adding them would give a much higher number, and atomic mass isn't the sum. So B is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C suggests an equal distribution, so (35 +37)/2 = 36. But if the isotopes weren't equally abundant, this would be wrong. Since the actual atomic mass is 35.45, which is closer to 35, it must mean that the 35 isotope is more abundant. So C is not the right answer either.\n\nOption D says the predominant isotope mass is 35. But even though 35 is the more abundant, the atomic mass isn't exactly 35 because there's still some 37 contributing. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A. The weighted average of the isotopes, considering their natural abundances, gives the atomic mass listed on the periodic table. The calculation in option A gives approximately 35.46, which is very close to the given 35.45, so that's the right approach.\n</think>"}
