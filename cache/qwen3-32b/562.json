However, observe that:\n\n$$\nx^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}\n$$\n\nExpanding $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$ using the binomial theorem gives a term $(-x)^{2001} = -x^{2001}$, so the leading terms cancel:\n\n$$\nx^{2001} + (-x^{2001}) = 0\n$$\n\nTherefore, the equation simplifies to a **degree-2000** polynomial. This means the equation has 2000 distinct roots (as given in the problem statement).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Using Vieta's Formula\n\nLet the polynomial be written as:\n\n$$\nP(x) = x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}\n$$\n\nAfter cancellation of the leading terms, the highest degree is 2000. To apply Vieta's formulas, we need the coefficients of $x^{2000}$ and $x^{1999}$ in $P(x)$.\n\nWe can compute these using the binomial expansion of $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$:\n\n- The coefficient of $x^{2000}$ is:\n  $$\n  \\binom{2001}{2000} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1 \\cdot (-1)^{2000} = 2001 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2001}{2}\n  $$\n\n- The coefficient of $x^{1999}$ is:\n  $$\n  \\binom{2001}{1999} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot (-1)^{1999} = \\binom{2001}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{2001 \\cdot 2000}{8}\n  $$\n\nNow, using Vieta’s formula for the sum of the roots of a degree-2000 polynomial:\n\n$$\n\\text{Sum of roots} = -\\frac{\\text{coefficient of } x^{1999}}{\\text{coefficient of } x^{2000}} = -\\left( \\frac{-2001 \\cdot 2000 / 8}{2001 / 2} \\right)\n$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$\n\\text{Sum of roots} = \\frac{2001 \\cdot 2000 / 8}{2001 / 2} = \\frac{2000}{4} = 500\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Alternative Symmetry Argument\n\nWe can also approach this problem through symmetry. Suppose $x$ is a root of the equation:\n\n$$\nx^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = 0\n$$\n\nLet $y = \\frac{1}{2} - x$. Then $y$ satisfies the same equation:\n\n$$\ny^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - y\\right)^{2001} = x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = 0\n$$\n\nSo, if $x$ is a root, then $y = \\frac{1}{2} - x$ is also a root. This implies that the roots come in **pairs** $\\{x, \\frac{1}{2} - x\\}$, and the sum of each such pair is:\n\n$$\nx + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nSince the polynomial is of degree 2000, and each pair contributes 1/2 to the total sum, the total number of such pairs is 1000, and the total sum is:\n\n$$\n1000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 500\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{500}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the roots, both real and non-real, of the equation $x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = 0$. The problem also mentions that there are no multiple roots, which probably means all roots are distinct. Alright, let me start by recalling some algebra concepts that might help here.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any polynomial equation, the sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. Vieta's relates the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of its roots. However, in order to use Vieta's formulas, I need the equation to be in a standard polynomial form, right? The given equation is $x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = 0$. Let me see if I can expand this or rewrite it in a standard polynomial form.\n\nBut before expanding, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think. The equation is $x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = 0$. Let me denote $y = \\frac{1}{2} - x$. Then, substituting, we have $x^{2001} + y^{2001} = 0$, and since $y = \\frac{1}{2} - x$, maybe I can relate x and y somehow. Also, note that 2001 is an odd exponent, so $x^{2001} = -y^{2001}$ implies $x = -y$, because for odd exponents, the function is bijective over real numbers. Wait, but since we have complex roots as well, maybe there's more to it?\n\nBut if I consider real roots, then $x = -y$ would imply $x = -(\\frac{1}{2} - x)$, so solving for x:\n\n$x = -\\frac{1}{2} + x$, which simplifies to $0 = -\\frac{1}{2}$, which is impossible. Therefore, there are no real roots? Wait, but that seems strange. Let me check again.\n\nIf $x^{2001} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$, then taking both sides to the power of 1/2001 (since 2001 is odd), we get $x = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)$. Therefore, solving:\n\n$x = -\\frac{1}{2} + x$, which leads to $0 = -\\frac{1}{2}$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no real roots? Hmm. But that seems odd because for polynomials of odd degree, there must be at least one real root. Wait, but the equation here is of degree 2001? Let me check the degree.\n\nOriginal equation is $x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$. If we expand $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$, the leading term is $(-x)^{2001} = -x^{2001}$. Therefore, adding $x^{2001} + (-x^{2001})$ gives 0. Wait, so when we expand the entire equation, the leading terms cancel out? That means the equation is actually of degree less than 2001? That seems important.\n\nSo let me verify that. Let me expand $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = \\sum_{k=0}^{2001} \\binom{2001}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2001 - k} (-x)^k\n$$\n\nTherefore, the leading term (when k=2001) is $\\binom{2001}{2001} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0} (-x)^{2001} = -x^{2001}$. Therefore, when we add $x^{2001} + (-x^{2001})$, those leading terms cancel. Therefore, the next term is the term with $x^{2000}$. Let me compute the coefficient for $x^{2000}$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$:\n\nFor k=2000, the term is $\\binom{2001}{2000} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1} (-x)^{2000} = 2001 * \\frac{1}{2} * x^{2000} = \\frac{2001}{2} x^{2000}$. However, since the original equation is $x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = 0$, and the $x^{2001}$ term cancels, the next term is $\\frac{2001}{2} x^{2000}$ from the second expansion. However, there is no $x^{2000}$ term in the first part of the equation, so overall, the coefficient of $x^{2000}$ is $\\frac{2001}{2}$. Therefore, the equation is actually a polynomial of degree 2000? Because the leading degree 2001 terms cancel out?\n\nTherefore, the equation is a degree 2000 polynomial. Therefore, there are 2000 roots (real and non-real). Therefore, Vieta's formula applies here. The sum of the roots of a polynomial $a_n x^n + ... + a_0$ is $-a_{n-1}/a_n$. Therefore, if I can find the coefficients of $x^{2000}$ and $x^{2001}$ in the original equation, but since the original equation simplifies to a degree 2000 polynomial, let me denote P(x) = $x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$. Then, expanding P(x), as we saw, the leading term is 0, so P(x) is degree 2000. Therefore, to apply Vieta's formula, I need to find the coefficient of $x^{2000}$ and the leading coefficient (which is for $x^{2000}$).\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me denote P(x) = $x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$. As established, the leading terms cancel, so the degree is 2000. Let me write P(x) as a polynomial of degree 2000. Let me compute the coefficient of $x^{2000}$ in P(x). As above, from $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$, the coefficient of $x^{2000}$ is $\\binom{2001}{2000} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1} \\cdot (-1)^{2000}$. Since $(-1)^{2000} = 1$, so that term is $2001 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{2001}{2}$. The first term in P(x) is $x^{2001}$, which doesn't have an $x^{2000}$ term. Therefore, the coefficient of $x^{2000}$ in P(x) is $\\frac{2001}{2}$. However, since P(x) is equal to zero, we can write P(x) = 0, which is equivalent to the polynomial equation of degree 2000. Therefore, if I write P(x) as $a_{2000}x^{2000} + ... + a_0 = 0$, then the sum of the roots is $-a_{1999}/a_{2000}$. Wait, Vieta's formula says the sum is $-a_{n-1}/a_n$ for a degree n polynomial. So here, n = 2000, so sum is $-a_{1999}/a_{2000}$. Therefore, I need to find the coefficients of $x^{2000}$ and $x^{1999}$ in P(x).\n\nBut I already have the coefficient of $x^{2000}$ as $\\frac{2001}{2}$. Now I need the coefficient of $x^{1999}$ in P(x). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, from the term $x^{2001}$, there is no $x^{1999}$ term. So all the $x^{1999}$ term comes from the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$. Let's compute that.\n\nIn the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$, the coefficient of $x^{k}$ is $\\binom{2001}{k} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2001 - k} \\cdot (-1)^k$. Therefore, for k=1999, the coefficient is:\n\n$$\n\\binom{2001}{1999} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2001 - 1999} \\cdot (-1)^{1999}\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, $\\binom{2001}{1999} = \\binom{2001}{2} = \\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{2}$. Then, $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. And $(-1)^{1999} = -1$. Therefore, multiplying all together:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times (-1) = -\\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{8}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^{1999}$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$ is $-\\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{8}$. Since there is no $x^{1999}$ term in $x^{2001}$, the total coefficient of $x^{1999}$ in P(x) is just $-\\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{8}$.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial P(x) can be written as:\n\n$$\nP(x) = \\left( \\frac{2001}{2} \\right)x^{2000} + \\left( -\\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{8} \\right)x^{1999} + \\ldots = 0\n$$\n\nTherefore, according to Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is $-a_{1999}/a_{2000}$. Here, $a_{2000} = \\frac{2001}{2}$ and $a_{1999} = -\\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{8}$. Therefore:\n\nSum of roots = $- \\left( -\\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{8} \\right) / \\left( \\frac{2001}{2} \\right) = \\frac{2001 \\times 2000}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{2001} $.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 2001 cancels out, and 2/8 is 1/4. Therefore, Sum = $\\frac{2000}{4} = 500$.\n\nWait, so the sum of all roots is 500? Let me check that again.\n\nYes:\n\nNumerator: -a_{1999} is -(-2001*2000/8) = 2001*2000/8\n\nDivided by a_{2000} which is 2001/2.\n\nTherefore, (2001*2000/8) / (2001/2) = (2000/8) * 2 = 2000/4 = 500. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 500? Let me think again if there is another way to get this result, maybe more straightforwardly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is some symmetry or substitution that can make this easier. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider the equation $x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = 0$. Let me denote $y = x - \\frac{1}{4}$. Maybe shifting the variable? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps consider substituting $x = \\frac{1}{4} + t$, to center the equation? Maybe not. Alternatively, think about roots coming in pairs?\n\nAlternatively, since the equation is $x^{2001} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001}$. Taking magnitudes on both sides, if we think about complex roots. For complex numbers, if $z^{2001} = -w^{2001}$, then |z| = |w|. Therefore, |x| = |1/2 - x|. Which might imply that x lies on the perpendicular bisector of 0 and 1/2 in the complex plane. Which for real numbers would be x = 1/4. But since we have complex roots, maybe they lie on that line? However, maybe this is complicating.\n\nAlternatively, note that if r is a root, then maybe there's some relation between roots? For example, if we suppose that if x is a root, then something else is also a root?\n\nLet me check. Suppose x is a root. Then:\n\n$x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^{2001} = 0$\n\nLet me consider substituting $ \\frac{1}{2} - x $. Let me denote y = 1/2 - x. Let me check if y is also a root.\n\nCompute $y^{2001} + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - y \\right)^{2001}$. Substitute y = 1/2 - x:\n\nFirst term: $y^{2001} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - x \\right)^{2001}$\n\nSecond term: $\\frac{1}{2} - y = \\frac{1}{2} - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - x \\right) = x$. Therefore, the second term is $x^{2001}$. Therefore, the entire expression becomes $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} - x \\right)^{2001} + x^{2001} = 0$. Which is the original equation. Therefore, if x is a root, then y = 1/2 - x is also a root. Therefore, the roots come in pairs {x, 1/2 - x}. Therefore, each pair sums to x + (1/2 - x) = 1/2. \n\nTherefore, if all roots can be paired like that, then the total sum would be (number of pairs) * 1/2. Since the polynomial is of degree 2000, which is even, there are 2000 / 2 = 1000 pairs. Therefore, total sum is 1000 * 1/2 = 500. Which matches the previous result. Therefore, 500 is the answer. \n\nThis approach seems more elegant and confirms the earlier result. Therefore, regardless of whether the roots are real or complex, they come in pairs adding up to 1/2. Therefore, the total sum is 500. \n\nBut wait, why can we assume that all roots are paired like that? Suppose there is some root which is fixed under the transformation x → 1/2 - x. That is, roots satisfying x = 1/2 - x, which implies 2x = 1/2 ⇒ x = 1/4. So if x = 1/4 is a root, then it would not be paired with another distinct root. However, in that case, plugging x = 1/4 into the original equation:\n\nLeft-hand side: $(1/4)^{2001} + (1/2 - 1/4)^{2001} = 2*(1/4)^{2001} ≠ 0$. Therefore, x = 1/4 is not a root. Therefore, there are no roots fixed under this transformation. Therefore, all roots come in distinct pairs {x, 1/2 - x}, hence 1000 pairs for 2000 roots, each pair summing to 1/2, total sum 500. Therefore, this confirms the answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 500. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{500}\n</think>"}
