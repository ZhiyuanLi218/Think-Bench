{"question":"A coating is applied to a substrate resulting in a perfectly smooth surface. The measured contact angles of this smooth coating are 127° and 96° for water and oil respectively. The coating formulation is then modified and when now applied to the same type of substrate, a rough surface is produced. When a droplet of water or oil sits on the rough surface, pockets of air are now trapped in the cavities between the surface and the droplet. The droplets on the rough surface are now effectively in contact with 47% coating and 53% air. What would the measured water and oil contact angles of the rough surface be?

The problem says that the coating was originally smooth with contact angles of 127° for water and 96° for oil. Then, when the coating is modified to make a rough surface, the droplets are in contact with 47% coating and 53% air. The question is asking what the new contact angles would be. The options are given as A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm, I remember that when a surface becomes rough, the contact angle can change depending on whether the roughness enhances or reduces the wettability. There are two main theories here: the Wenzel model and the Cassie-Baxter model. The Wenzel model assumes that the liquid fully wets the rough surface, so the contact angle is modified by the roughness factor. The Cassie-Baxter model, on the other hand, considers that the liquid sits on top of the rough surface with air pockets underneath, which can lead to a different contact angle. \n\nIn this problem, the description says that \"pockets of air are now trapped in the cavities between the surface and the droplet,\" which sounds like the Cassie-Baxter model. The Cassie-Baxter equation relates the apparent contact angle on a composite surface (like a rough surface with air pockets) to the intrinsic contact angle on the smooth surface and the fraction of the surface in contact with the liquid. The formula is:\n\ncosθ_C = φ cosθ_Y + (1 - φ)\n\nWhere:\n- θ_C is the Cassie-Baxter contact angle\n- φ is the fraction of the surface area in contact with the liquid (in this case, 47% or 0.47)\n- θ_Y is the Young's contact angle on the smooth surface (given as 127° for water and 96° for oil)\n\nWait, let me confirm the formula. I think the Cassie-Baxter equation is indeed cosθ = f1 cosθ1 + f2 cosθ2, where f1 and f2 are the area fractions of the two phases (coating and air). Since air has a contact angle of 180° (as it's a gas), cosθ2 would be cos(180°) = -1. So substituting, it would be cosθ = φ cosθ_Y + (1 - φ)(-1). Let me rearrange that:\n\ncosθ_C = φ cosθ_Y - (1 - φ)\n\nSo substituting the given values for water first:\n\nFor water:\nφ = 0.47\nθ_Y = 127°\nSo cosθ_C = 0.47 * cos(127°) - (1 - 0.47)\n\nLet me calculate that. First, convert 127° to radians? Wait, no, I can just use a calculator for the cosine. Let me recall the value of cos(127°). Since 127° is in the second quadrant, cosine is negative there. Let me compute cos(127°):\n\ncos(127°) ≈ cos(90° + 37°) = -sin(37°) ≈ -0.6018 (approximate value). Alternatively, using calculator input:\n\ncos(127°) ≈ cos(127) ≈ -0.6040 (using calculator). Let me check with actual calculation. Let me use calculator steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use exact calculation. Let me do that.\n\nFirst, for water:\n\nθ_Y_water = 127°, φ = 0.47.\n\nCompute cosθ_C = 0.47 * cos(127°) - (1 - 0.47)\n\nLet me compute cos(127°):\n\nUsing calculator, cos(127°) ≈ cos(127 * π / 180) ≈ cos(2.216 radians) ≈ -0.6040.\n\nSo:\n\ncosθ_C = 0.47 * (-0.6040) - 0.53\n\nCalculate 0.47 * (-0.6040) ≈ -0.28388\n\nThen subtract 0.53: -0.28388 - 0.53 = -0.81388\n\nSo cosθ_C ≈ -0.8139\n\nThen θ_C = arccos(-0.8139). Let's compute that.\n\nArccos(-0.8139) is in the second quadrant. Let me find the angle whose cosine is -0.8139.\n\nFirst, find the reference angle: arccos(0.8139) ≈ 35.5 degrees (since cos(35°) ≈ 0.8192, which is close to 0.8139). So the actual angle is 180° - 35.5° ≈ 144.5°. Let me check with a calculator.\n\nIf I take arccos(-0.8139), using calculator:\n\nLet me compute the value. Let me use a calculator here. Let me approximate.\n\nAlternatively, since I don't have a calculator, but I can use known values. For example, cos(144°) is cos(180° - 36°) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090. Our value is -0.8139, which is a bit more negative than -0.8090. So the angle is a bit more than 144°. Let me check cos(145°):\n\ncos(145°) = cos(180° - 35°) = -cos(35°) ≈ -0.8192. Our value is -0.8139, which is between -0.8090 (cos144°) and -0.8192 (cos145°). Let me do a linear approximation.\n\nLet me denote x as the angle in degrees between 144° and 145°, where cos(x) = -0.8139.\n\nLet’s let’s suppose between 144° and 145°, the cosine decreases from -0.8090 to -0.8192. The difference between these two values is -0.8192 - (-0.8090) = -0.0102 over 1 degree.\n\nOur target is -0.8139, which is -0.8139 - (-0.8090) = -0.0049 below the value at 144°. So fractionally, that's -0.0049 / -0.0102 ≈ 0.48 of the interval. So approximately 144° + 0.48° ≈ 144.48°, so roughly 144.5°. Therefore, the contact angle for water would be approximately 144.5°, which is close to option D (144° for water).\n\nNow for oil:\n\nθ_Y_oil = 96°, φ = 0.47.\n\nAgain, using the Cassie-Baxter equation:\n\ncosθ_C = 0.47 * cos(96°) - (1 - 0.47)\n\nFirst compute cos(96°). 96° is 6° more than 90°, so it's in the second quadrant. cos(96°) is negative. Let me compute it.\n\ncos(96°) ≈ cos(90° + 6°) = -sin(6°) ≈ -0.1045. Alternatively, using calculator:\n\ncos(96°) ≈ cos(96 * π / 180) ≈ cos(1.6755 radians) ≈ -0.1045.\n\nSo:\n\ncosθ_C = 0.47 * (-0.1045) - 0.53\n\nCalculate 0.47 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0491\n\nThen subtract 0.53: -0.0491 - 0.53 = -0.5791\n\nTherefore, cosθ_C ≈ -0.5791\n\nNow find θ_C = arccos(-0.5791). Let me figure out the angle.\n\nAgain, arccos(-0.5791). The reference angle is arccos(0.5791). Let's see, cos(54.7°) ≈ 0.577 (since cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(45°) ≈ 0.707). Let me check cos(55°) ≈ 0.5736. So 0.5791 is a bit higher, so maybe around 54.5°. Therefore, the actual angle is 180° - 54.5° = 125.5°. Let me check with known values.\n\nFor example, cos(125°) is cos(180° - 55°) = -cos(55°) ≈ -0.5736. Our value is -0.5791, which is a bit more negative. So the angle is a bit more than 125°. Let's see:\n\nBetween 125° and 126°, cos(125°) ≈ -0.5736, cos(126°) = cos(180° - 54°) = -cos(54°) ≈ -0.5878. So our value is -0.5791, which is between -0.5736 and -0.5878. Let's find how much.\n\nThe difference between -0.5736 and -0.5878 is -0.0142 over 1 degree. Our target is -0.5791 - (-0.5736) = -0.0055 below the value at 125°. So fractionally, -0.0055 / -0.0142 ≈ 0.387. So approximately 0.387 degrees beyond 125°, so total angle ≈ 125.387°, which is approximately 125.4°. So the oil contact angle would be approximately 125.4°, which is close to option D (125° for oil).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Water = 140°, Oil = 118° → Not matching.\n\nB: Water = 151°, Oil = 136° → Higher than our calculation.\n\nC: Water = 148°, Oil = 131° → Still higher than our approx 144.5° and 125.4°.\n\nD: Water = 144°, Oil = 125° → Very close to our calculations (144.5° and 125.4°). So D seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor water:\n\ncosθ_C = 0.47 * cos(127°) - 0.53\n\ncos(127°) ≈ -0.6040\n\n0.47 * (-0.6040) ≈ -0.28388\n\nThen subtract 0.53: -0.28388 - 0.53 = -0.81388 → arccos(-0.81388) ≈ 144.5°. Correct.\n\nFor oil:\n\ncosθ_C = 0.47 * cos(96°) - 0.53\n\ncos(96°) ≈ -0.1045\n\n0.47 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0491\n\n-0.0491 - 0.53 = -0.5791 → arccos(-0.5791) ≈ 125.4°. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: Water = 144°, Oil = 125°.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nD: Water = 144°, Oil = 125°. Yes, that's exactly what I calculated. So D is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
