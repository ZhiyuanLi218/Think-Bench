Hmm, let's see. The units digit is the last digit of the number, right? So, for example, if I have 18 squared, that's 324, so the units digit is 4. But calculating 18^6 directly might be tedious because it's a big number. There must be a smarter way to figure out just the units digit without computing the entire value.\n\nI remember something about patterns in the units digits when raising numbers to powers. For example, numbers ending in 2 have a repeating pattern for their units digits when raised to powers. Let me check if that applies here. Since 18 ends with an 8, maybe I can focus just on the units digit of the base, which is 8, and figure out the pattern for powers of 8?\n\nLet me try writing out the powers of 8 and see if there's a cycle or pattern:\n\n8^1 = 8 (units digit 8)\n8^2 = 64 (units digit 4)\n8^3 = 512 (units digit 2)\n8^4 = 4096 (units digit 6)\n8^5 = 32768 (units digit 8)\n8^6 = 262144 (units digit 4)\n\nWait, so the units digits cycle every 4 powers: 8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4... So the pattern is 8, 4, 2, 6, then repeats. So the cycle length is 4. Therefore, if I can figure out where 8^6 falls in this cycle, I can determine the units digit.\n\nSince the cycle repeats every 4, I can divide the exponent by 4 and see the remainder. For 8^6, the exponent is 6. Dividing 6 by 4 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2. So the remainder is 2. That means 8^6 has the same units digit as 8^(remainder), but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, if the remainder is 1, it's like 8^1, remainder 2 is 8^2, etc. But if the remainder is 0, it would be 8^4, right? So for exponent 6, since 6 divided by 4 is 1 with remainder 2, so it's like the second position in the cycle. Let me check the earlier calculations:\n\n8^1: remainder 1: units digit 8\n8^2: remainder 2: units digit 4\n8^3: remainder 3: units digit 2\n8^4: remainder 0: units digit 6\nThen 8^5: remainder 1 (since 5 divided by 4 is 1 with remainder 1): units digit 8 again.\n\nTherefore, yes, if the exponent is 6, remainder 2, so units digit is 4? Wait, but when I actually calculated 8^6 above, the units digit was 4? Wait, let me check again:\n\nEarlier, I wrote 8^6 = 262144, which ends with 4. So according to the pattern, since 6 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2, the units digit is the same as 8^2, which is 4. That matches. Therefore, the units digit of 8^6 is 4, so the units digit of 18^6 is also 4?\n\nWait, but why can we just focus on the units digit of the base? Let me think. Suppose we have two numbers, say, a and b, where a and b have the same units digit. Then, when you raise them to a power, their units digits will follow the same pattern? For example, 18 and 28 both end with 8. Let's check 28^2: 28*28. 20*20=400, 20*8=160, 8*20=160, 8*8=64. Adding up: 400 + 160 + 160 + 64 = 784. Units digit 4, same as 18^2=324. So yes, the units digit of the power depends only on the units digit of the base. Therefore, since 18 ends with 8, 18^6 will have the same units digit as 8^6, which we determined is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut let me verify this another way, just to be sure. Maybe using modular arithmetic? Since we are interested in the units digit, which is equivalent to the number modulo 10. So, 18^6 mod 10. Since 18 ≡ 8 mod 10, so 18^6 ≡ 8^6 mod 10. So we just need to compute 8^6 mod 10.\n\nEarlier, we saw that 8^1 mod10=8, 8^2=64 mod10=4, 8^3=8*4=32 mod10=2, 8^4=8*2=16 mod10=6, 8^5=8*6=48 mod10=8, 8^6=8*8=64 mod10=4. Yep, same result. So 8^6 mod10=4. Therefore, 18^6 mod10=4. Therefore, units digit is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use Euler's theorem or something? Although Euler's theorem requires that the base and modulus are coprime. Since 8 and 10 are not coprime (they share a factor of 2), Euler's theorem doesn't apply here. But since we already found a pattern with the cyclicity, that's sufficient.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the cycle. Let me write out more terms. 8^1=8, 8^2=64, 8^3=512, 8^4=4096, 8^5=32768, 8^6=262144, 8^7=2097152, 8^8=16777216. So units digits: 8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6... Yep, so cycle length is 4. So exponents 1, 5, 9,... are 8; 2,6,10,... are 4; 3,7,11,... are 2; 4,8,12,... are 6. Therefore, 6 is in the second position, units digit 4. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute 8^6 mod 10 is to break it down:\n\nWe can note that 8^2=64 ≡ 4 mod10,\n\nthen 8^4 = (8^2)^2 ≡ 4^2 = 16 ≡ 6 mod10,\n\nthen 8^6 = 8^4 * 8^2 ≡ 6 * 4 = 24 ≡ 4 mod10. Yep, same answer. So that's another way to compute it, using exponents breakdown.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the units digit is 4.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 18^6 step by step, keeping track of the units digit only, since intermediate multiplications' other digits don't affect the units digit of the final result.\n\nStarting with 18:\n\n18^1 = 18, units digit 8.\n\n18^2 = 18 * 18. Let's compute the units digit: 8 * 8 = 64, units digit 4. So 18^2 has units digit 4.\n\n18^3 = 18^2 * 18. The units digit is 4 * 8. 4*8=32, units digit 2. So 18^3 has units digit 2.\n\n18^4 = 18^3 * 18. Units digit 2 * 8 = 16, units digit 6.\n\n18^5 = 18^4 * 18. Units digit 6 * 8 = 48, units digit 8.\n\n18^6 = 18^5 * 18. Units digit 8 * 8 = 64, units digit 4.\n\nSo following this step-by-step multiplication, focusing only on the units digit each time, we also end up with 4 as the units digit of 18^6. So that's consistent with all previous methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the units digit is indeed 4.\n\nAnother way someone might approach this is by recognizing that the units digit cycles every 4, so for exponent 6, subtract 4 once to get 2, so it's equivalent to 8^2, which is 4. That's essentially using Euler's theorem concept, but since 8 and 10 aren't coprime, φ(10)=4, but Euler's theorem says that a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n if a and n coprime. Since 8 and 10 aren't coprime, 8^4 mod10 is 6, not 1. So that's different. But the cyclicity still exists because of the patterns in the exponents.\n\nSo, in summary, regardless of the method used—observing the pattern in the units digits, using modular arithmetic step by step, breaking down the exponentiation—the units digit of 18^6 is 4. Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe units digit of $18^6$ is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>"}
