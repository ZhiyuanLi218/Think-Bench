Let me start by recalling what I know about physics, specifically momentum conservation. Since the problem says to ignore gravity and air resistance during the expulsion, I think that means we can consider the system (rocket + gas) as isolated during that short time. So, the total momentum should be conserved.\n\nBut wait, the rocket starts from rest, right? Before ignition, both the rocket and the gas are at rest, so the initial total momentum is zero. After the gas is expelled, there are two objects: the rocket moving upward and the gas moving downward (since it's expelled from the nozzle). Their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero. So, the momentum of the rocket should be equal to the momentum of the expelled gas but in the opposite direction. Therefore, the magnitude of the rocket's momentum should equal the magnitude of the gas's momentum.\n\nLet me check the numbers. The mass of the rocket is 1.00 kg, but the mass of the gas expelled is 50 grams. Oh, I need to convert grams to kilograms. 50 grams is 0.050 kg. The gas is expelled at 600 m/s. So, the momentum of the gas is mass times velocity: 0.050 kg * 600 m/s. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 600 = 30. So, the gas has a momentum of 30 kg·m/s downward. Therefore, the rocket must have a momentum of 30 kg·m/s upward. So, the answer should be option A, 30 kg·m/s.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"the magnitude of the rocket's momentum,\" so direction doesn't matter here. The calculation seems straightforward. The mass of the rocket is given as 1.00 kg, but actually, after expelling 0.05 kg of gas, the rocket's mass would be 1.00 kg - 0.05 kg = 0.95 kg. But wait, does the problem consider the mass of the rocket after expulsion or before? The problem states the rocket's mass is 1.00 kg. Hmm, but when calculating the rocket's momentum, we need to know its velocity. However, if we use conservation of momentum, the initial total momentum is zero, so the rocket's momentum is equal and opposite to the gas's momentum regardless of the rocket's mass. Wait, so maybe I don't need the rocket's mass? That seems odd. Let me think again.\n\nConservation of momentum: initial momentum = final momentum. Initial momentum is zero. Final momentum is momentum of gas + momentum of rocket = 0. Therefore, momentum of rocket = -momentum of gas. Therefore, the magnitude is equal to the momentum of the gas. Therefore, regardless of the rocket's mass or velocity, as long as there are no external forces, the rocket's momentum is equal in magnitude to the gas's. Therefore, even if the rocket's mass changes, since we are only asked for the momentum, not the velocity, it's just equal to the gas's momentum. Therefore, 30 kg·m/s. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's a trick here. For example, sometimes in rocket problems, you have to consider the expulsion over time and thrust, but the problem says \"in a short time,\" and we are to ignore gravity during that time. So, even though the rocket's mass is 1.00 kg, the expelled mass is 0.05 kg. The key is that the total momentum is conserved. So, if the gas has 30 kg·m/s downward, the rocket must have 30 kg·m/s upward. Therefore, the answer is A. The other options are way higher, like 5.7×10², which is 570, which seems too big. How could that be? Maybe someone thought that the rocket's velocity is 600 m/s? But no, the gas is expelled at 600 m/s, not the rocket. Since the gas has a smaller mass, but higher velocity, and rocket has larger mass but lower velocity. Let me compute the velocity of the rocket for practice. If rocket's momentum is 30 kg·m/s, and its mass is 0.95 kg (original 1.00 kg minus 0.05 kg gas), then velocity is p/m = 30 / 0.95 ≈ 31.58 m/s. That seems reasonable. So, the momentum is indeed 30 kg·m/s. So answer is A. Therefore, the correct option is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
