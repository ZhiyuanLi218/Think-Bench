Let me start by recalling what each term means. \n\nStarting with option A: \"32S and 34S are isotopes of each other.\" Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. Sulfur has the atomic number 16, so both 32S and 34S have 16 protons. The difference in mass number (32 vs. 34) would mean they have different neutrons (32-16=16 neutrons for 32S, and 34-16=18 for 34S). So they are indeed isotopes. So A is correct, not incorrect. So the incorrect options are not A.\n\nOption B: \"C70 and carbon nanotubes are allotropes of each other.\" Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element. Carbon has several allotropes like diamond, graphite, graphene, fullerenes (like C60, C70), and carbon nanotubes. So yes, C70 is a fullerene, and carbon nanotubes are another form of carbon. Therefore, they are allotropes. So B is correct. So not incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"CH2ClCH2Cl and CH3CHCl2 are isomers of each other.\" Isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures. Let me check their formulas. \n\nFor CH2ClCH2Cl: The formula would be C2H4Cl2. Let's count: 2 carbons, 4 hydrogens, 2 chlorines. \n\nFor CH3CHCl2: The formula is also C2H4Cl2. Carbon count: 2. Hydrogens: CH3 has 3, CHCl2 has 1 H (since each Cl replaces H), so total H is 3+1=4. Chlorines: each Cl on the second carbon, so 2 Cls. So same molecular formula. \n\nNow, their structures differ. CH2ClCH2Cl has two Cl atoms on different carbons (each on a CH2 group), whereas CH3CHCl2 has two Cls on the same carbon (the second carbon). So they are structural isomers. Therefore, C is correct. So not incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"C3H6 and C4H8 are definitely homologs of each other.\" Homologs are compounds that belong to the same homologous series, differing by a CH2 group. For alkanes, the formula is CnH2n+2. For alkenes, it's CnH2n. So C3H6 could be propene (an alkene) or cyclopropane (a cycloalkane, which also has formula CnH2n). Similarly, C4H8 could be butene or cyclobutane. \n\nIf both are alkenes, then they are homologs (since each subsequent member differs by CH2). However, if one is a cycloalkane and the other is an alkene, they are not homologs but have the same general formula. \n\nMoreover, C3H6 could also be isopropyl but not sure. Wait, but homologs require a difference of one CH2 unit. Since C3H6 and C4H8 differ by one CH2, if they are in the same series, they are homologs. But the problem is that the statement says \"definitely homologs of each other.\" However, if C3H6 is cyclopropane (cycloalkane) and C4H8 is cyclobutane (another cycloalkane), then they are homologs. But if C3H6 is propene (alkene) and C4H8 is butene (alkene), they are also homologs. However, what if C3H6 is something else? Wait, but the molecular formulas are set. Wait, C3H6 is either cyclopropane or propene. Similarly for C4H8. However, the problem is that the statement says \"definitely homologs\". But if they are both in the same series, yes, but if they are in different series, they aren't. Wait, but cycloalkanes and alkenes have the same general formula. For example, cyclopropane (C3H6) and propene (C3H6) are different structures but same formula. Similarly, cyclobutane (C4H8) and butene (C4H8). Therefore, if C3H6 is propene and C4H8 is butene, they are homologs. If C3H6 is cyclopropane and C4H8 is cyclobutane, they are also homologs. However, if C3H6 is propene and C4H8 is cyclobutane, then they are not homologs because they are in different series. Therefore, the statement says \"definitely homologs\", but depending on the actual structures, they might not be. So the statement is incorrect because it's not necessarily true. Hence, D is incorrect.\n\nSo the incorrect options are D. Wait, let me check again. The question asks for incorrect statements. The options are A, B, C, D. The user is to pick the incorrect ones. So if A, B, C are correct, D is incorrect. So the answer is D. But let me confirm once more.\n\nAnother angle: Homologs must differ by one CH2 and have same general formula. For alkenes, general formula CnH2n. C3H6 (n=3) and C4H8 (n=4) fit that. So if both are alkenes, they are homologs. But if one is a cycloalkane and the other is an alkene, they still have same general formula. However, cycloalkanes and alkenes are different series. Wait, but cycloalkanes have general formula CnH2n, same as alkenes. So cyclopropane (C3H6) and cyclobutane (C4H8) are homologs in the cycloalkane series. Similarly, propene and butene are homologs in the alkene series. However, if you have C3H6 as propene and C4H8 as cyclobutane, they have same formula but belong to different series (alkene vs cycloalkane). Therefore, they are not homologs. Therefore, the statement \"C3H6 and C4H8 are definitely homologs\" is incorrect because there are cases where they are not. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is D. So the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
