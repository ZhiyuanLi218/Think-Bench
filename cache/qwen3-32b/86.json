This substitution simplifies the denominators on the left-hand side.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations that have fractions, it's often helpful to find a common denominator or maybe make a substitution to simplify things. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the left side, each term has a denominator of the form $x^2 - k$, where k is 1, 2, 3, 4. The numerators are just the numbers 1 through 4. The right side is a linear function in x, which is 2010x minus 4. \n\nSince all denominators involve $x^2$, maybe I can let $y = x^2$ to simplify the equation? Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet $y = x^2$. Then the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n$$\n\nWait, but there's still an x on the right side. Hmm. If I substitute y = x², then x is related to y by x = ±√y. But since there's an x on the right side, maybe I need to express the equation in terms of x? Or perhaps I need to consider both possibilities for x?\n\nThis might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation to combine the left side and bring everything to one side? Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me denote the left side as L(y):\n\n$$\nL(y) = \\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n$$\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n$$\nL(y) = 2010x - 4.\n$$\n\nBut again, I still have x and y related by y = x². So perhaps I need to write everything in terms of y. However, since x is present on the right side, maybe I need to square both sides or something? Wait, but squaring might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that for each solution y, there are two solutions x (positive and negative square roots), unless y is zero or negative. But since y = x², y must be non-negative real numbers if x is real. However, since we are considering complex solutions, y can be any complex number except 1, 2, 3, 4 (since those would make denominators zero). \n\nBut the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions. So maybe I can find the sum of all x's that satisfy the equation. \n\nBut how to handle the equation with both y and x?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that if I can express the equation in terms of y and x, perhaps I can find a relationship between them. Let me try to rearrange the equation:\n\nLet me move the right side to the left:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n$$\n\nBut since y = x², maybe substitute that in:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n$$\n\nBut this brings me back to the original equation. Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that for each y, there are two x's (except when y is a perfect square, but since we are considering complex solutions, y can be any complex number except 1,2,3,4). Wait, but if y is complex, then x is also complex. \n\nBut maybe I can think of this equation as two separate equations? For example, once I solve for y, then for each y, x² = y, so x = ±√y. Therefore, if I can find all possible y's that satisfy the equation in terms of y and x, then for each such y, I can get two x's (unless y is zero, but even then, x would be zero, but then y would be zero, but denominators would be -1, -2, etc., so that's okay). \n\nHowever, the problem is that in the equation, we have both y and x. So unless there is a way to eliminate x, this seems difficult. Maybe there is a trick here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the right-hand side is 2010x - 4. If I consider that equation, perhaps I can consider that for each solution x, there is a corresponding y = x², and then the equation relates y and x. But unless there is some symmetry or way to combine these, maybe I need to consider that if I can write the equation as something involving x and y, and then use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that if I have the equation:\n\nLeft side is a function of y, and the right side is a function of x. So maybe I can write:\n\nLeft side (function of y) = Right side (function of x). But since y = x², perhaps I can write:\n\nLeft side (function of x²) - Right side (function of x) = 0.\n\nSo, the entire equation is a function of x, which we can denote as f(x) = 0, and we need to find the sum of all roots of f(x) = 0.\n\nIf I can write this equation as a polynomial equation in x, then the sum of the roots is given by Vieta's formula, which is - (coefficient of x^{n-1}) / (coefficient of x^n), where n is the degree of the polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is that the original equation is not a polynomial equation because of the denominators. So perhaps I need to manipulate the equation to turn it into a polynomial equation.\n\nTo do that, I need to eliminate denominators by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let me note that denominators on the left side are (x² - 1), (x² - 2), (x² - 3), (x² - 4). The LCM of these denominators would be (x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4). Let me denote that as D.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides of the equation by D:\n\n$$\nD \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} \\right) = D \\cdot (2010x - 4).\n$$\n\nLet me compute the left side term by term.\n\nFirst term: D / (x² - 1) = (x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4)\n\nSecond term: 2 * D / (x² - 2) = 2*(x² - 1)(x² - 3)(x² - 4)\n\nThird term: 3 * D / (x² - 3) = 3*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 4)\n\nFourth term: 4 * D / (x² - 4) = 4*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)\n\nTherefore, the left side becomes:\n\n$$\n(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) + 2(x² - 1)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 4) + 4(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)\n$$\n\nAnd the right side is:\n\n$$\n(2010x - 4)(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4)\n$$\n\nThis seems very complicated. Expanding all these terms would lead to a high-degree polynomial. However, maybe there is a smarter way to handle this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the left side is a function of y = x², so maybe first compute the left side as a function of y, set it equal to 2010x - 4, and then combine with y = x²?\n\nBut again, we have the problem of x and y. Let me try to compute the left side as a function of y.\n\nLet me denote y = x². Then the left side is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}\n$$\n\nLet me compute this sum. Let me combine them step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 1/(y - 1) + 2/(y - 2):\n\nLet me find common denominator (y - 1)(y - 2):\n\n$$\n\\frac{(y - 2) + 2(y - 1)}{(y - 1)(y - 2)} = \\frac{y - 2 + 2y - 2}{(y - 1)(y - 2)} = \\frac{3y - 4}{(y - 1)(y - 2)}\n$$\n\nThen add 3/(y - 3):\n\nCommon denominator is (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3):\n\n$$\n\\frac{(3y - 4)(y - 3) + 3(y - 1)(y - 2)}{(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)}\n$$\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\nFirst term: (3y - 4)(y - 3) = 3y(y) - 9y - 4y + 12 = 3y² - 13y + 12\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n(3y - 4)(y - 3) = 3y * y + 3y*(-3) -4*y -4*(-3) = 3y² -9y -4y +12 = 3y² -13y +12\n\nSecond term: 3*(y -1)(y -2) = 3*(y² -3y +2) = 3y² -9y +6\n\nAdding these two together:\n\n3y² -13y +12 +3y² -9y +6 = 6y² -22y +18\n\nTherefore, the sum after adding the third term is:\n\n(6y² -22y +18)/[(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)]\n\nNow, add the fourth term, 4/(y -4):\n\nCommon denominator is (y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4)\n\nSo:\n\n[ (6y² -22y +18)(y -4) + 4(y -1)(y -2)(y -3) ] / [(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4)]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst part: (6y² -22y +18)(y -4)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n6y² * y = 6y³\n\n6y² * (-4) = -24y²\n\n-22y * y = -22y²\n\n-22y * (-4) = +88y\n\n18 * y = 18y\n\n18 * (-4) = -72\n\nSo combining:\n\n6y³ -24y² -22y² +88y +18y -72 = 6y³ -46y² +106y -72\n\nSecond part: 4*(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)\n\nFirst compute (y -1)(y -2) = y² -3y +2\n\nMultiply by (y -3):\n\n(y² -3y +2)(y -3) = y³ -3y² -3y² +9y +2y -6 = y³ -6y² +11y -6\n\nMultiply by 4: 4y³ -24y² +44y -24\n\nTherefore, total numerator is:\n\nFirst part + second part:\n\n6y³ -46y² +106y -72 + 4y³ -24y² +44y -24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(6y³ +4y³) + (-46y² -24y²) + (106y +44y) + (-72 -24)\n\n= 10y³ -70y² +150y -96\n\nTherefore, the left side simplifies to:\n\n(10y³ -70y² +150y -96)/[(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4)]\n\nTherefore, the original equation becomes:\n\n(10y³ -70y² +150y -96)/[(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4)] = 2010x -4\n\nBut since y = x², we can write:\n\n(10y³ -70y² +150y -96)/[(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4)] + 4 = 2010x\n\nSo:\n\nLeft side: [ (10y³ -70y² +150y -96) + 4*(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4) ] / [(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4)] = 2010x\n\nTherefore, numerator:\n\nLet me compute 4*(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4) + 10y³ -70y² +150y -96\n\nFirst, let me compute (y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4). Let me denote this as P(y).\n\nLet me compute P(y):\n\nFirst, group them as [(y -1)(y -4)] * [(y -2)(y -3)].\n\nCompute (y -1)(y -4) = y² -5y +4\n\nCompute (y -2)(y -3) = y² -5y +6\n\nThen multiply them together:\n\n(y² -5y +4)(y² -5y +6). Let me let z = y² -5y, then it becomes (z +4)(z +6) = z² +10z +24.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(y² -5y)^2 +10(y² -5y) +24.\n\nCompute (y² -5y)^2 = y^4 -10y³ +25y²\n\nThen 10(y² -5y) = 10y² -50y\n\nAdding up:\n\ny^4 -10y³ +25y² +10y² -50y +24 = y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24\n\nTherefore, P(y) = y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24\n\nTherefore, 4*P(y) = 4y^4 -40y³ +140y² -200y +96\n\nNow add the other terms: 10y³ -70y² +150y -96\n\nTotal numerator:\n\n4y^4 -40y³ +140y² -200y +96 +10y³ -70y² +150y -96\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4y^4 + (-40y³ +10y³) + (140y² -70y²) + (-200y +150y) + (96 -96)\n\nWhich is:\n\n4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y +0\n\nSo numerator simplifies to 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y)/[(y -1)(y -2)(y -3)(y -4)] = 2010x\n\nBut note that the denominator is P(y) = y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24. However, our numerator is 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y. Let me check if this numerator can be simplified or factored with the denominator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the left side as:\n\n[4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y]/[y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24] = 2010x\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, maybe we can perform polynomial division of numerator by denominator?\n\nLet me try dividing 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y by y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24.\n\nLet me denote denominator as D(y) = y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24\n\nNumerator N(y) = 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y\n\nDivide N(y) by D(y):\n\nThe leading term is 4y^4 divided by y^4, which is 4. Multiply D(y) by 4:\n\n4D(y) = 4y^4 -40y³ +140y² -200y +96\n\nSubtract this from N(y):\n\nN(y) - 4D(y) = (4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y) - (4y^4 -40y³ +140y² -200y +96)\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n4y^4 -4y^4 = 0\n\n-30y³ - (-40y³) = 10y³\n\n70y² -140y² = -70y²\n\n-50y - (-200y) = 150y\n\n0 - 96 = -96\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 10y³ -70y² +150y -96.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nN(y)/D(y) = 4 + [10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y)\n\nWait, but earlier when we were simplifying the left side, we had:\n\nOriginal left side after substitution was:\n\n[10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) = 2010x -4 - previous steps?\n\nWait, no, in the previous steps, we had:\n\nOriginal equation became [N(y)] / D(y) = 2010x. But after division, N(y)/D(y) = 4 + [10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y). Therefore,\n\n4 + [10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) = 2010x.\n\nBut earlier, when we computed the left side of the original equation, we had:\n\nLeft side was [10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) = 2010x -4. Therefore, adding 4 to both sides gives:\n\n[10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) + 4 = 2010x. Which is the same as N(y)/D(y) = 2010x. Which is consistent with the division result. Therefore, perhaps this isn't helping me much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to set the remainder equal to something? Wait, from the division, we have:\n\nN(y) = 4*D(y) + (10y³ -70y² +150y -96). Therefore,\n\nN(y)/D(y) = 4 + [10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) = 2010x.\n\nBut earlier, we had:\n\nOriginal equation after combining terms was:\n\n[10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) + 4 = 2010x, which is the same as this. Therefore, this seems to be going in circles.\n\nPerhaps another approach is needed. Let me recall that Vieta's formula requires a polynomial equation. If I can write the equation as a polynomial in x, then I can find the sum of roots. However, given that the equation is complicated, maybe there is a trick here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that if we have an equation involving x and y = x², and if we can find a relationship between x and y, perhaps we can find that the equation implies some symmetry or allows substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the equation as follows: Let me write the entire equation again:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n$$\n\nLet me consider that the left side is a function of x². Suppose I denote t = x², then the left side is a function f(t), and the equation is f(t) = 2010x - 4. However, since t = x², if we can find solutions (t, x) such that t = x² and f(t) = 2010x - 4.\n\nBut solving this system might be difficult. However, perhaps if we consider that for each solution x, there is a corresponding t = x². Let me suppose that for each solution x, there is a corresponding t, and then if I can find a relationship between t and x, perhaps I can combine equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that if I have two equations:\n\nt = x²,\n\nand\n\nf(t) = 2010x - 4.\n\nIf I can eliminate t between these equations, I can get an equation in x. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that for each x, t is determined, so substituting t into the second equation. However, since f(t) is known once t is known, but t is x². Therefore, the equation is f(x²) = 2010x - 4. Which is the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the equation is f(x²) - 2010x + 4 = 0. Let me denote this as F(x) = 0. If I can write F(x) as a polynomial, then Vieta's formula applies. However, since F(x) has denominators, it's not a polynomial. However, if I multiply through by the denominators, which are (x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4), then I can get a polynomial equation. However, as I started earlier, this would result in a very high-degree polynomial. But maybe there is a way to find the sum of roots without expanding everything?\n\nLet me recall that if we have an equation P(x)/Q(x) = 0, then the roots are the roots of P(x) = 0, excluding the roots of Q(x) = 0. However, in our case, the equation is not just P(x)/Q(x) = 0, but P(x)/Q(x) = 2010x - 4. Therefore, bringing everything to one side:\n\nP(x)/Q(x) - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\nMultiplying through by Q(x):\n\nP(x) - (2010x - 4)Q(x) = 0.\n\nWhich is a polynomial equation. Therefore, if I can write this polynomial, then the sum of its roots is given by Vieta's formula. However, the problem is that this polynomial will have degree equal to the degree of Q(x) plus 1? Wait, Q(x) is (x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4), which is degree 8. Then P(x) is the numerator we computed earlier, which was 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y, but in terms of x, since y = x², so substituting back:\n\nWait, actually, when we multiplied both sides by Q(x), we had:\n\nLeft side was N(y) = 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y, which in terms of x is 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x².\n\nAnd the right side was (2010x - 4) * Q(x) = (2010x - 4)(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4). \n\nTherefore, moving everything to the left side:\n\n4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x² - (2010x - 4)(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) = 0.\n\nThis is a polynomial equation. Let me denote this as R(x) = 0. The degree of this polynomial would be the maximum of the degree of the first term (which is 8) and the degree of the second term. The second term is (2010x - 4) multiplied by an 8th-degree polynomial in x², which is degree 8. Therefore, multiplying by x gives degree 9. Therefore, the second term is degree 9. Therefore, R(x) is a degree 9 polynomial. Therefore, the sum of all roots of R(x) = 0 is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9). \n\nBut we need to be careful here. The original equation might have some restrictions. For example, the original equation has denominators (x² - k), so x cannot be ±√k for k = 1,2,3,4. Therefore, the polynomial R(x) = 0 may have roots at these points, which are excluded. Therefore, the actual solutions of the original equation are the roots of R(x) = 0 excluding those roots which make any denominator zero. However, if we can ensure that none of the excluded values are roots of R(x), then Vieta's formula would apply. However, it's possible that some roots of R(x) correspond to excluded x's, so we need to check. But since the problem says \"all complex solutions\", and complex solutions include those excluded real ones? Wait, no. The excluded solutions are those that make denominators zero, so they are not solutions. Therefore, if R(x) has roots at x = ±√k, then they need to be excluded. However, if we can show that R(±√k) ≠ 0, then Vieta's formula applies to all roots of R(x) = 0, which are exactly the solutions of the original equation.\n\nBut verifying whether R(±√k) = 0 might be tedious. However, maybe we can assume that since the original equation is undefined at those points, they are not solutions, so R(x) has roots there? Or maybe not? Let me check for one value, say x = 1. Let me compute R(1):\n\nFirst, compute left side: 4(1)^8 -30(1)^6 +70(1)^4 -50(1)^2 = 4 -30 +70 -50 = (4 -30) + (70 -50) = (-26) + 20 = -6\n\nThen compute the second term: (2010*1 - 4)*Q(1). Q(1) is (1 -1)(1 -2)(1 -3)(1 -4) = 0 * ... = 0. Therefore, R(1) = -6 - (2010*1 -4)*0 = -6 ≠ 0. Therefore, x=1 is not a root of R(x). Similarly for other excluded points. Therefore, R(x) does not have roots at x = ±√k. Therefore, all roots of R(x) = 0 are valid solutions of the original equation. Therefore, Vieta's formula applies.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the coefficient of x^9 and x^8 in R(x), then the sum of roots is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9).\n\nTherefore, my task reduces to finding the coefficient of x^9 and x^8 in R(x).\n\nRecall that R(x) = 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x² - (2010x - 4) * Q(x), where Q(x) = (x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4). \n\nFirst, let me find the expansion of Q(x). Earlier, we found that Q(y) = y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24 where y = x². Therefore, substituting back y = x²:\n\nQ(x) = (x²)^4 -10(x²)^3 +35(x²)^2 -50(x²) +24 = x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24.\n\nTherefore, Q(x) = x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24.\n\nTherefore, R(x) = 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x² - (2010x - 4)(x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24).\n\nNow, we need to compute the coefficient of x^9 and x^8 in R(x). Let me denote:\n\nLet me write R(x) = A(x) - (2010x - 4) * Q(x), where A(x) = 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x².\n\nTherefore, the term -(2010x -4)*Q(x) will contribute to the coefficients of R(x). Let me compute the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in -(2010x -4)*Q(x).\n\nFirst, expand (2010x -4)*Q(x):\n\n= 2010x * Q(x) - 4 * Q(x).\n\nTherefore, the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 will come from both terms.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficients of x^8 and x^9 in 2010x * Q(x):\n\nSince Q(x) is degree 8, multiplying by x gives degree 9. The coefficient of x^9 in 2010x * Q(x) is 2010 multiplied by the coefficient of x^8 in Q(x). From Q(x) = x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24, the coefficient of x^8 is 1. Therefore, coefficient of x^9 in 2010x * Q(x) is 2010 * 1 = 2010.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of x^8 in 2010x * Q(x) is 2010 multiplied by the coefficient of x^7 in Q(x). However, Q(x) is x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24. There is no x^7 term, so coefficient is 0. Therefore, coefficient of x^8 in 2010x * Q(x) is 2010 * 0 = 0.\n\nNext, consider -4 * Q(x). The coefficient of x^9 in -4 * Q(x) is 0, since Q(x) has no x^9 term. The coefficient of x^8 in -4 * Q(x) is -4 multiplied by the coefficient of x^8 in Q(x), which is -4 * 1 = -4.\n\nTherefore, combining both parts:\n\nCoefficient of x^9 in (2010x -4) * Q(x) is 2010 (from 2010x * Q(x)) + 0 (from -4 * Q(x)) = 2010.\n\nCoefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4) * Q(x) is 0 (from 2010x * Q(x)) + (-4) (from -4 * Q(x)) = -4.\n\nTherefore, in R(x) = A(x) - (2010x -4) * Q(x), the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 are:\n\nFor x^9: 0 (since A(x) has no x^9 term) - 2010 = -2010.\n\nFor x^8: coefficient from A(x) is 4, minus coefficient from -(2010x -4) * Q(x), which is -(-4) = +4? Wait, wait, let me be precise.\n\nWait, R(x) = A(x) - (2010x -4)*Q(x). Therefore, the coefficient of x^9 in R(x) is [coefficient of x^9 in A(x)] - [coefficient of x^9 in (2010x -4)*Q(x)].\n\nSince A(x) has no x^9 term, coefficient is 0 - 2010 = -2010.\n\nSimilarly, coefficient of x^8 in R(x) is [coefficient of x^8 in A(x)] - [coefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4)*Q(x)].\n\nCoefficient of x^8 in A(x) is 4. Coefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4)*Q(x) is -4. Therefore:\n\n4 - (-4) = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nWait, no: R(x) = A(x) - (2010x -4)*Q(x). Therefore, it's [A(x)] + [ - (2010x -4)*Q(x) ].\n\nTherefore, coefficient of x^8 is:\n\n[coefficient of x^8 in A(x)] + [coefficient of x^8 in - (2010x -4)*Q(x) ].\n\nCoefficient of x^8 in - (2010x -4)*Q(x) is - [coefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4)*Q(x) ] = -(-4) = 4? Wait earlier we found coefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4)*Q(x) is -4. Therefore, coefficient of x^8 in - (2010x -4)*Q(x) is -(-4) = +4. Therefore, adding to coefficient of x^8 in A(x) which is 4, total coefficient is 4 + 4 = 8. \n\nTherefore, in R(x), the coefficient of x^9 is -2010, and coefficient of x^8 is 8. \n\nTherefore, the polynomial R(x) is of degree 9, with leading term -2010x^9 + 8x^8 + ... \n\nTherefore, by Vieta's formula, the sum of all roots of R(x) = 0 is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9) = - (8)/(-2010) = 8/2010.\n\nSimplify 8/2010: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 4/1005. \n\nBut let me check again the calculation for the coefficient of x^8 in R(x). \n\nOriginal A(x) is 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x². So coefficient of x^8 is 4. \n\nThen, -(2010x -4) * Q(x). Earlier, we found that (2010x -4)*Q(x) has coefficient of x^8 equal to -4, so -(2010x -4)*Q(x) has coefficient of x^8 equal to -(-4) = +4. Therefore, total coefficient of x^8 in R(x) is 4 + 4 = 8. Yes, that's correct. \n\nCoefficient of x^9 in R(x) is 0 (from A(x)) minus 2010 (from -(2010x * Q(x))) which is -2010. \n\nTherefore, sum of roots is - (8)/(-2010) = 8/2010 = 4/1005. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"sum of all complex solutions\". However, complex solutions include both real and non-real solutions. However, Vieta's formula counts all roots of the polynomial, with multiplicity, and includes all complex roots. Since we have already considered that R(x) = 0 has no roots at the excluded points, then all roots of R(x) = 0 are valid solutions of the original equation. Therefore, the sum is 4/1005. \n\nBut let me check whether there is a mistake here. The polynomial R(x) is of degree 9, so there are 9 roots (counting multiplicities). However, the original equation is:\n\nLeft side: sum of fractions equals 2010x -4. The left side, for each x not in {±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2}, is defined. Therefore, R(x) is constructed such that its roots are exactly the solutions of the original equation. Therefore, Vieta's formula applies. Therefore, the sum is 8/2010 = 4/1005. \n\nBut let me check if I messed up signs. Vieta's formula for a polynomial of degree n:\n\nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 = 0, sum of roots is -a_{n-1}.\n\nBut in our case, the polynomial R(x) is:\n\n-2010x^9 + 8x^8 + ... = 0.\n\nTo apply Vieta, we can write it as:\n\n-2010x^9 + 8x^8 + ... = 0 ⇒ Multiply both sides by -1:\n\n2010x^9 -8x^8 + ... = 0.\n\nThen, the polynomial is 2010x^9 -8x^8 + ... = 0. Therefore, the sum of roots is (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9) with a sign. Wait, Vieta's formula says that for ax^n + bx^{n-1} + ... , sum of roots is -b/a. \n\nIn the polynomial 2010x^9 -8x^8 + ... = 0, the coefficient of x^9 is 2010, coefficient of x^8 is -8. Therefore, sum of roots is -(-8)/2010 = 8/2010 = 4/1005. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4/1005. However, let me check if there's any mistake in my calculation of coefficients. \n\nLet me recap:\n\nCoefficient of x^9 in R(x):\n\nFrom A(x): 0. From -(2010x -4)Q(x): - [coefficient from (2010x -4)Q(x) which is 2010]. Therefore total: 0 - 2010 = -2010. Correct.\n\nCoefficient of x^8 in R(x):\n\nFrom A(x): 4. From -(2010x -4)Q(x): - [coefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4)Q(x) which is -4] ⇒ -(-4) = +4. Therefore total 4 + 4 = 8. Correct.\n\nThus, Vieta gives 8 / 2010 = 4 / 1005. Simplify 4/1005: 4 and 1005 share a common divisor? Let's see. 1005 ÷ 5 = 201. 4 and 5 are coprime, so 4/1005 is reduced.\n\nBut let me check 1005: 1005 = 5 × 201 = 5 × 3 × 67. 4 and 1005 have no common factors, so yes, 4/1005 is simplest form.\n\nBut let me check once again if there is any error in reasoning. For example, maybe I missed some term in the coefficients?\n\nWait, when I calculated the coefficient of x^8 in -(2010x -4)*Q(x), I considered only the contribution from -4*Q(x). But is there another contribution from 2010x*Q(x)?\n\nEarlier, I said that coefficient of x^8 in 2010x*Q(x) is 0, because Q(x) has no x^7 term. Let me verify that. \n\nQ(x) = x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24. Therefore, multiplying by 2010x, we get:\n\n2010x^9 - 2010*10x^7 + 2010*35x^5 - 2010*50x^3 + 2010*24x. \n\nTherefore, indeed, there is no x^8 term in 2010x * Q(x). Therefore, coefficient of x^8 in 2010x * Q(x) is 0. Therefore, coefficient of x^8 in -(2010x -4)*Q(x) is - [0 - 4*1] = -[-4] = 4? Wait, no:\n\nWait, -(2010x -4)*Q(x) = -2010x*Q(x) + 4*Q(x). Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in this expression is:\n\nCoefficient from -2010x*Q(x): 0 (as established)\n\nPlus coefficient from +4*Q(x): 4*(coefficient of x^8 in Q(x)) = 4*1 = 4.\n\nTherefore total coefficient of x^8 is 0 + 4 = 4. Therefore, adding to the coefficient from A(x), which is 4, total is 8. Correct.\n\nTherefore, calculations are correct.\n\nHence, the sum of all complex solutions is 4/1005.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose we have a simpler equation. Let me take a simpler case where I can compute manually. For example, suppose the equation is 1/(x² - 1) = kx - c. Following similar steps, would Vieta give the correct sum?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to check. For example, suppose that the equation is symmetric in some way. However, given that the right-hand side is 2010x -4, which is linear, it's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that if I have an equation f(x²) = ax + b, then for each solution x, -x may or may not be a solution. Let me check.\n\nSuppose x is a solution, then is -x a solution? Let me check:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nLeft side for -x: same as for x, since x² is same as (-x)^2. Therefore, left side is same. Right side for -x: 2010*(-x) -4 = -2010x -4. \n\nTherefore, unless -2010x -4 equals 2010x -4, which would require -2010x = 2010x ⇒ x=0. \n\nBut for x=0, check if it's a solution:\n\nLeft side: 1/(0 -1) + 2/(0 -2) + 3/(0 -3) + 4/(0 -4) = -1 -1 -1 -1 = -4. Right side: 2010*0 -4 = -4. Therefore, x=0 is a solution. \n\nTherefore, x=0 is a solution. For other solutions, if x is a solution, then -x is a solution only if 2010x -4 = -2010x -4 ⇒ 4020x = 0 ⇒ x=0. Therefore, only x=0 is a solution that is its own negative. Therefore, other solutions come in pairs x and -x, but with different right-hand sides. Therefore, except for x=0, solutions do not come in pairs. Therefore, the sum of all solutions is not necessarily zero. \n\nBut according to our previous result, the sum is 4/1005 ≈ 0.00398... which is not zero. However, since there is a solution at x=0, and other solutions not paired, this is possible.\n\nBut how can we check if 4/1005 is correct? Well, since Vieta's formula was applied correctly given the polynomial, and the coefficients were calculated correctly, I think the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4/1005.\n\nBut let me check if 4/1005 can be simplified further or if there was a miscalculation in the coefficients.\n\nWait, 8 divided by 2010: 8/2010 = 4/1005. Yes. 1005 divided by 5 is 201, 4 and 5 are coprime. So yes, simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in some other form? Let me check if I made a mistake in signs.\n\nWait, Vieta's formula says that for the polynomial a_n x^n + ... + a_0, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n. \n\nIn our case, R(x) is equal to -2010x^9 + 8x^8 + ... So written as:\n\nR(x) = -2010x^9 + 8x^8 + ... = 0.\n\nTherefore, a_n = -2010, a_{n-1} = 8. Therefore, sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n = -8 / (-2010) = 8/2010 = 4/1005. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we write the polynomial as 2010x^9 - 8x^8 + ... = 0, then a_n = 2010, a_{n-1} = -8. Sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n = -(-8)/2010 = 8/2010. Same result. \n\nTherefore, yes, 4/1005 is correct.\n\nBut let me check if x=0 is indeed a root of R(x). Let me compute R(0):\n\nA(0) = 4*0 -30*0 +70*0 -50*0 = 0.\n\nThen -(2010*0 -4)*Q(0) = -(-4)*Q(0) = 4*Q(0). Q(0) is (0 -1)(0 -2)(0 -3)(0 -4) = (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4) = (2)(12) = 24. Therefore, 4*24 = 96. Therefore, R(0) = 0 + 96 = 96 ≠ 0. Wait, but earlier we saw that x=0 satisfies the original equation. What's happening here?\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. Earlier, when I checked x=0, the left side was -4 and the right side was -4, so x=0 is a solution. Therefore, R(0) should be zero. But according to my calculation, R(0) = 96. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my calculation of R(x). \n\nThis is a critical error. Let me trace back.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nAfter multiplying both sides by Q(x), we had:\n\nLeft side: N(y) = 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y, with y = x².\n\nBut when I converted back to x, I substituted y = x² into N(y):\n\nN(y) = 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y becomes 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x². That is correct.\n\nThen R(x) = N(y) - (2010x - 4)Q(x) = 0.\n\nBut when x=0, N(y) = 4*(0)^8 -30*(0)^6 +70*(0)^4 -50*(0)^2 = 0.\n\nThen -(2010x -4)*Q(x) evaluated at x=0 is -(-4)*Q(0) = 4*Q(0). Q(0) is (0^2 -1)(0^2 -2)... etc. Which is (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4) = (24). Therefore, 4*24 = 96. Therefore, R(0) = 0 + 96 = 96 ≠ 0. But x=0 is a solution. Therefore, there is a mistake here.\n\nThis suggests that my previous derivation is wrong. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me go back. The original equation after multiplying by Q(x) was:\n\nLeft side: N(y) = 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y.\n\nBut how was N(y) derived?\n\nPreviously, I had:\n\nOriginal left side after combining terms was [10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) = 2010x -4.\n\nThen adding 4 to both sides gives [10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) + 4 = 2010x.\n\nThen multiplying both sides by D(y):\n\n10y³ -70y² +150y -96 + 4D(y) = 2010x D(y).\n\nThen moving everything to left:\n\n10y³ -70y² +150y -96 + 4D(y) - 2010x D(y) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n4D(y) + 10y³ -70y² +150y -96 - 2010x D(y) = 0.\n\nBut D(y) is y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24.\n\nTherefore, 4D(y) is 4y^4 -40y³ +140y² -200y +96.\n\nAdding 10y³ -70y² +150y -96:\n\nTotal is 4y^4 -40y³ +140y² -200y +96 +10y³ -70y² +150y -96 =\n\n4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y + 0.\n\nTherefore, equation is:\n\n4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y - 2010x D(y) = 0.\n\nBut then, when I converted back to x, I substituted y = x² into 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y, getting 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x². However, the term -2010x D(y) becomes -2010x * D(x²). Wait, here is the mistake!\n\nEarlier, I thought that R(x) was equal to N(y) - (2010x -4)Q(x). But actually, the equation is:\n\nN(y) - 2010x D(y) = 0, where N(y) = 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y and D(y) = y^4 -10y³ +35y² -50y +24. Therefore, substituting back y = x², we get:\n\nR(x) = [4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x²] - 2010x * [x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24] = 0.\n\nBut previously, I had written R(x) = A(x) - (2010x -4)Q(x). This was incorrect. The correct expression is R(x) = A(x) - 2010x * Q(x), where A(x) = 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x² and Q(x) = x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24. The -4 term was already incorporated in the previous steps. \n\nWait, let me retrace. Originally, we had:\n\nStarting from:\n\n[10y³ -70y² +150y -96]/D(y) + 4 = 2010x.\n\nMultiply both sides by D(y):\n\n10y³ -70y² +150y -96 + 4D(y) = 2010x D(y).\n\nTherefore, bringing all terms to the left:\n\n10y³ -70y² +150y -96 + 4D(y) - 2010x D(y) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n4D(y) + 10y³ -70y² +150y -96 - 2010x D(y) = 0.\n\nBut earlier, we found that 4D(y) + 10y³ -70y² +150y -96 equals N(y) = 4y^4 -30y³ +70y² -50y. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nN(y) - 2010x D(y) = 0 ⇒ N(y) = 2010x D(y).\n\nTherefore, substituting back y = x²:\n\nA(x) = 2010x Q(x), where A(x) = 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x² and Q(x) = x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24.\n\nTherefore, R(x) = A(x) - 2010x Q(x) = 0.\n\nPreviously, I had mistakenly included a -4 term, which was incorrect. The correct R(x) is A(x) - 2010x Q(x). Therefore, my earlier calculation of R(x) was wrong because I incorrectly included -(2010x -4)Q(x). The -4 was already incorporated into the derivation when we added 4D(y). Therefore, this explains why R(0) was not zero before; I had an incorrect expression for R(x).\n\nNow, let's recalculate the coefficients of R(x) = A(x) - 2010x Q(x). \n\nGiven that:\n\nA(x) = 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x².\n\nQ(x) = x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24.\n\nTherefore, 2010x * Q(x) = 2010x^9 - 2010*10x^7 + 2010*35x^5 - 2010*50x^3 + 2010*24x.\n\nTherefore, R(x) = A(x) - 2010x * Q(x) is:\n\n(4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x²) - [2010x^9 - 20100x^7 + 70350x^5 - 100500x^3 + 48240x].\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= -2010x^9 + 4x^8 + 20100x^7 - 30x^6 - 70350x^5 + 70x^4 + 100500x^3 - 50x^2 - 48240x.\n\nTherefore, R(x) is a 9th-degree polynomial:\n\n-2010x^9 + 4x^8 + 20100x^7 - 30x^6 - 70350x^5 + 70x^4 + 100500x^3 - 50x^2 - 48240x = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all roots of this equation. Using Vieta's formula, it's - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9).\n\nCoefficient of x^9 is -2010.\n\nCoefficient of x^8 is +4.\n\nTherefore, sum of roots is - (4)/(-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nWait, previously I had 4/1005, but now it's 2/1005. But let's check with x=0. Let me compute R(0):\n\nR(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 - 0 - 0 + 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 = 0? Wait, according to the expanded R(x):\n\nR(x) = -2010x^9 + 4x^8 + 20100x^7 - 30x^6 - 70350x^5 + 70x^4 + 100500x^3 - 50x^2 - 48240x.\n\nAt x=0, all terms have x to some power ≥1, so R(0) = 0. However, earlier when I computed manually, I found that x=0 satisfies the original equation. Therefore, R(0) should be zero, which it is. Previously, my mistake was in the expression of R(x). Therefore, this corrected expression shows R(0)=0, which is correct. \n\nBut let me verify with another value. Take x=0, original equation:\n\nLeft side: -4, right side: -4. Correct.\n\nNow, let's recalculate the coefficients for Vieta's formula. The polynomial is:\n\n-2010x^9 + 4x^8 + ... \n\nSo leading term is -2010x^9, next term is +4x^8. Therefore, sum of roots is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9) = - (4)/(-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005 ≈ 0.00199...\n\nPreviously, I had 4/1005 due to a miscalculation. Now it's 2/1005. \n\nBut why did this happen? Because earlier I had incorrectly included a -4*Q(x) term, which was not there. Now, the correct R(x) is A(x) - 2010x Q(x), leading to coefficient of x^8 being +4, and coefficient of x^9 being -2010.\n\nTherefore, the correct sum is 4/2010 = 2/1005. \n\nBut let me check this calculation again. \n\nOriginal R(x) = A(x) - 2010x * Q(x). \n\nA(x) has a term 4x^8. \n\nThe term -2010x * Q(x) has no x^8 term, since multiplying Q(x) by x gives x^9 term and lower. The coefficient of x^8 in -2010x * Q(x) is zero, because Q(x) has no x^7 term. Therefore, coefficient of x^8 in R(x) is 4 (from A(x)) + 0 (from -2010x*Q(x)) = 4. \n\nYes, so Vieta's formula gives sum of roots as - (4)/(-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005. \n\nTherefore, my previous calculation was wrong due to an incorrect expression for R(x), and now it's corrected to 2/1005. \n\nBut let me verify with another approach. Let me consider that x=0 is a root. Suppose there are other roots. The sum is 2/1005. \n\nBut to check if this is correct, let me consider the original equation and think about symmetry or other properties. \n\nAs previously noted, except for x=0, solutions do not come in pairs. However, Vieta's formula gives the total sum as 2/1005. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another error. Let me check the coefficient of x^8 again. \n\nA(x) is 4x^8 -30x^6 + ... \n\n-2010x * Q(x) is -2010x*(x^8 -10x^6 + ...) = -2010x^9 + 20100x^7 - ... \n\nTherefore, when combining terms, there is no contribution to x^8 from this term. Therefore, coefficient of x^8 is indeed 4. \n\nTherefore, Vieta's formula gives sum of roots as 4/2010 = 2/1005. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 2/1005. \n\nBut let me check with another example. Let me take x=0, which is a solution. What about another solution? For example, suppose there is a solution x=a, then according to the equation:\n\nLeft side: sum of fractions equals 2010a -4. \n\nBut without knowing specific solutions, it's hard to verify. However, since Vieta's formula was applied correctly now, and R(0)=0 is satisfied, I think this is the correct result.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me simplify 2/1005. 1005 divided by 2 is 502.5, so no, 2 and 1005 share a common factor of... 1005 is 5*201=5*3*67. 2 is prime, so no common factors. Therefore, 2/1005 is reduced.\n\nBut let me check if there was a miscalculation in the coefficient of x^8. \n\nOriginal R(x) = A(x) - 2010x * Q(x). \n\nA(x) has 4x^8. \n\n-2010x * Q(x) has no x^8 term. Therefore, total coefficient of x^8 is 4. Correct.\n\nYes, so sum is 4 / 2010 = 2 / 1005. \n\nTherefore, my previous answer of 4/1005 was incorrect due to a miscalculation in the expression of R(x). The correct answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me check once more with x=0. If the sum is 2/1005, and x=0 is one of the roots, then the sum of the rest of the roots is 2/1005 - 0 = 2/1005. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other roots whose sum we can estimate? For example, if there is a root at x = something simple?\n\nBut given the complexity of the equation, it's unlikely. Therefore, trusting the Vieta's formula application now that R(x) is correctly derived, I think 2/1005 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation of the coefficient of x^8 again. \n\nOriginal R(x) = A(x) - 2010x * Q(x). \n\nA(x) is 4x^8 -30x^6 +70x^4 -50x². \n\nQ(x) is x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x² +24. \n\nMultiply by 2010x: 2010x^9 - 2010*10x^7 + 2010*35x^5 - 2010*50x^3 + 2010*24x. \n\nTherefore, when subtracting this from A(x), the x^8 term in R(x) is only from A(x), which is 4x^8. There is no x^8 term from the -2010x*Q(x) part. Therefore, coefficient of x^8 is indeed 4. \n\nTherefore, Vieta's formula gives sum of roots as - (4)/(-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005. \n\nYes, correct. Therefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me think about the original equation:\n\nLeft side is a rational function in x², and the right side is linear in x. Suppose we consider that equation as f(x²) = ax + b. If we consider complex solutions, then for each solution x, there might be a relationship between x and -x, but as discussed earlier, except x=0, they don't come in pairs. However, if we consider that for each solution x ≠ 0, there might be another solution related somehow?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the equation can be rewritten in terms of x and -x. But without more structure, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that the left side is even function in x (since it's function of x²), while the right side is odd function plus a constant. Wait, no, the right side is 2010x -4. It's linear, not odd. \n\nBut if I consider that for the equation f(x²) = 2010x -4, if I replace x by -x, I get f(x²) = -2010x -4. Therefore, if x is a solution, then unless 2010x -4 = -2010x -4, which implies x=0, there's no relation. Therefore, the only solution that is symmetric is x=0. Therefore, the rest of the solutions come without symmetric counterparts, so their contributions to the sum are arbitrary.\n\nTherefore, Vieta's formula is the correct approach here, giving sum of roots as 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me check with x=0. If x=0 is a root, and the sum is 2/1005, then the other roots sum to 2/1005. Given that there are 9 roots in total (degree 9), and one of them is 0, the remaining 8 roots sum to 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, I think this is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 2/1005 can be simplified further. 1005 factors into 5 × 201 = 5 × 3 × 67. 2 and 1005 have no common factors, so yes, 2/1005 is simplest form.\n\nBut let me check with another value. Suppose I take x approaching infinity. What's the behavior of both sides?\n\nLeft side: each term 1/(x² - k) ~ 1/x², so total left side ~ (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)/x² = 10/x² → 0 as x→infty.\n\nRight side: 2010x -4 ~ 2010x → infinity. Therefore, for large x, the equation is not satisfied. Therefore, there are no solutions at infinity. \n\nTherefore, all solutions are finite, and Vieta applies. \n\nTherefore, I conclude that the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}\n</think>"}
