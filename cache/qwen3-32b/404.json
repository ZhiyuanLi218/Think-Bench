Let me start by recalling what I know about fluid dynamics. \n\nFirst, the problem mentions an ideal fluid. I remember that for ideal fluids, we can use the equation of continuity, which states that the volume flow rate must remain constant if the fluid is incompressible and there are no leaks. The volume flow rate Q (which I should probably use a different symbol for to avoid confusion with radius Q) is given by the product of the cross-sectional area A of the pipe and the flow speed v. So, Q = A * v.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the main pipe splits into three separate paths. So the total volume flow rate in the main pipe should equal the sum of the volume flow rates in the three smaller pipes. That makes sense because the fluid has to go somewhere, right? So, the principle here is conservation of mass, which for incompressible fluids translates to conservation of volume flow rate.\n\nLet me write that down. Let me denote the main pipe's radius as R (since Q is already used in the problem statement, maybe the user meant radius R? Wait, the problem says radius Q. Hmm, maybe it's just a symbol, so I'll stick with Q for radius). The flow speed in the main pipe is V. Then, the cross-sectional area of the main pipe is A1 = π*(Q)^2. The volume flow rate here would be Q1 = A1 * V.\n\nThen, the pipe splits into three paths, each with radius Q/2. So each smaller pipe has radius r = Q/2. The cross-sectional area of each smaller pipe is A2 = π*(Q/2)^2 = π*Q²/4. Since there are three such pipes, the total cross-sectional area of the three smaller pipes is 3*A2 = 3*(π*Q²/4) = (3/4)*π*Q².\n\nNow, according to the equation of continuity, the total volume flow rate before the split must equal the total after the split. So Q1 = Q2_total. That is, A1*V = 3*A2*v, where v is the flow speed in each of the smaller pipes. \n\nLet me plug in the areas. A1 is πQ², so πQ² * V = 3*(πQ²/4)*v. \n\nHmm, let me simplify this equation. First, notice that πQ² appears on both sides, so we can divide both sides by πQ². That gives V = 3*(1/4)*v. \n\nSimplify the right-hand side: 3/4 * v. So V = (3/4)v. Solving for v, multiply both sides by 4/3: v = (4/3)V. \n\nSo the flow speed in each of the smaller pipes is 4/3 times the original speed. Looking at the options, option C is 4/3 V. \n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Calculated area of main pipe: πQ². Correct.\n2. Volume flow rate Q1 = πQ² * V. Correct.\n3. Each smaller pipe area: π*(Q/2)² = πQ²/4. Correct.\n4. Three smaller pipes total area: 3*(πQ²/4). Correct.\n5. Total volume flow rate after split: 3*(πQ²/4)*v. Correct.\n6. Equate Q1 and Q2_total: πQ² * V = 3*(πQ²/4)*v. Correct.\n7. Cancel πQ²: V = (3/4)v. Then v = (4/3)V. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo the answer should be option C: 4/3 V. Let me check if there's another way someone might approach this and get a different answer. For example, if someone thought that splitting into three pipes would divide the speed by three, but that would be incorrect because the cross-sectional area also changes. The key is that the area of each smaller pipe is smaller, so even though there are three of them, the total area is 3*(1/4) = 3/4 of the original area. Since area is inversely proportional to velocity (since Q is constant), velocity increases by 4/3. \n\nAlternatively, if someone forgot to square the radius when calculating the area, they might have thought that the area of each small pipe is proportional to Q/2, leading to total area 3*(Q/2) = 3Q/2. Then equating A1*V = A_total*v, so πQ² * V = 3*(π*(Q/2)) * v. But that would be wrong because area is proportional to radius squared, not radius. So that approach is incorrect. \n\nAnother possible mistake is thinking that since the radius is halved, the area is quartered, so each small pipe has 1/4 the area, and with three of them, total area is 3/4. Then, since the total area is less than the original area (original area was 1, now 3/4), velocity must increase. Since Q = A*v, if A decreases by 3/4, then v increases by 4/3. Exactly what I did. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 4/3 V. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
