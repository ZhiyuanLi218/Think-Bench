So we can proceed confidently.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Converting the Denominator to a Power of 10\n\nTo convert the denominator to a power of 10, we need to balance the exponents of 2 and 5. Currently, we have:\n\n- $2^2$\n- $5^7$\n\nTo make the denominator a power of 10, we need to make the exponents of 2 and 5 equal.

Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that a fraction will have a terminating decimal expansion if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. In this case, the denominator is already given as 2² multiplied by 5⁷, which only has 2 and 5 as prime factors. So, that means this fraction should indeed convert to a terminating decimal. Good, so I don't have to worry about repeating decimals here.\n\nNow, how do I actually convert this fraction into a decimal? Well, one method is to adjust the denominator to be a power of 10, since decimals are based on powers of 10. To do that, I need to figure out what power of 10 the denominator can be converted into by multiplying by some factor. Since the denominator is 2² * 5⁷, I can see that there are more 5s than 2s. To make this a power of 10, I need to have equal numbers of 2s and 5s. \n\nLet me write down the denominator: 2² * 5⁷. If I want to make this into 10^n, which is (2*5)^n = 2^n * 5^n. Comparing that to the current denominator, which has 2² and 5⁷, I need to multiply numerator and denominator by enough 2s to make the number of 2s equal to the number of 5s. Since there are 7 fives, I need 7 twos in total. Currently, there are 2 twos, so I need to multiply by 2^(7-2) = 2^5. \n\nSo, multiplying numerator and denominator by 2^5 will give me:\n\nNumerator: 21 * 2^5\n\nDenominator: (2² * 5⁷) * 2^5 = 2^(2+5) * 5^7 = 2^7 * 5^7 = (2*5)^7 = 10^7\n\nTherefore, the fraction becomes (21 * 2^5)/10^7. Then, I can compute the numerator and then divide by 10^7 by moving the decimal point seven places to the left. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 2^5. 2^5 is 32. So, 21 multiplied by 32. Let me calculate 21*32. \n\nWell, 20*32 = 640, and 1*32 = 32, so adding those together gives 640 + 32 = 672. So the numerator is 672, and the denominator is 10^7, which is 10,000,000. \n\nTherefore, the decimal is 672 divided by 10,000,000. To convert this to decimal form, I divide 672 by 10^7, which is moving the decimal point seven places to the left. Let me write 672 as 672.0 and move the decimal seven places left.\n\nStarting with 672.0:\n\n1st place: 67.20\n\n2nd place: 6.720\n\n3rd place: 0.6720\n\n4th place: 0.06720\n\n5th place: 0.006720\n\n6th place: 0.0006720\n\n7th place: 0.00006720\n\nSo after moving seven decimal places, it becomes 0.0000672. Wait, let me check that again. Let me count the places:\n\nOriginal number: 672.0\n\nDivide by 10 once: 67.2 (1)\n\nDivide by 10 twice: 6.72 (2)\n\nDivide by 10 thrice: 0.672 (3)\n\nDivide by 10 four times: 0.0672 (4)\n\nDivide by 10 five times: 0.00672 (5)\n\nDivide by 10 six times: 0.000672 (6)\n\nDivide by 10 seven times: 0.0000672 (7)\n\nYes, so seven decimal places would result in 0.0000672. Let me verify this answer another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the original fraction step by step. Let's recall that dividing by 2 and 5 is straightforward for decimal conversion.\n\nOriginal fraction: 21 / (2² * 5⁷). Let me write that as 21 divided by (4 * 78125) because 2² is 4 and 5⁷ is 5*5*5*5*5*5*5. Let me compute 5⁷:\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n5^3 = 125\n\n5^4 = 625\n\n5^5 = 3125\n\n5^6 = 15625\n\n5^7 = 78125\n\nSo denominator is 4 * 78125. Let me compute 4*78125. Well, 78125 * 4: 78125*2=156,250; times 2 again is 312,500. Therefore, denominator is 312,500. Therefore, the fraction is 21 divided by 312,500.\n\nNow let me compute 21 / 312,500. To do this division, perhaps I can simplify the fraction or convert it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since we already did the previous method and got 0.0000672, let me check if 21 divided by 312,500 equals that.\n\nFirst, note that 1 / 312,500 is equal to 1 / (3.125 * 10^5) = (1 / 3.125) * 10^(-5). Let me compute 1 / 3.125. \n\nWell, 3.125 is the same as 25/8, since 25 divided by 8 is 3.125. Therefore, 1 divided by (25/8) is 8/25, which is 0.32. Therefore, 1 / 3.125 = 0.32. Therefore, 1 / 312,500 is 0.32 * 10^(-5) = 0.0000032. Therefore, 21 / 312,500 is 21 * 0.0000032. Let me compute that.\n\n21 * 0.0000032. Let's compute 20 * 0.0000032 = 0.000064, and 1 * 0.0000032 = 0.0000032. Adding them together: 0.000064 + 0.0000032 = 0.0000672. \n\nYes! That matches the previous result. Therefore, the decimal is 0.0000672. So that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach by breaking down the original fraction. Let me try that.\n\nOriginal fraction: 21 / (2² * 5⁷). Let me write this as 21 divided by (2² * 5² * 5^5) = 21 divided by [(2*5)^2 * 5^5] = 21 divided by [10² * 5^5]. Then, 5^5 is 3125. Therefore, denominator is 100 * 3125 = 312,500. Which is the same as before. So again, 21 / 312,500 = 0.0000672. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the original fraction by multiplying numerator and denominator by something else. Wait, earlier I multiplied numerator and denominator by 2^5 to get denominator as 10^7. Let me check that again. \n\nOriginal denominator: 2² * 5⁷. Multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5: denominator becomes 2^(2+5)*5^7 = 2^7*5^7 = (2*5)^7 = 10^7. Numerator becomes 21 * 2^5 = 21*32 = 672. Therefore, 672 / 10^7. Since 10^7 is 10 million, which is 1 followed by seven zeros. Therefore, 672 divided by 10 million is 0.0000672. Yep, same result. \n\nSo all methods lead to the same decimal: 0.0000672. Let me just confirm once more with direct division. \n\nLet me try dividing 21 by 312,500 manually. \n\nFirst, note that dividing by 312,500 is the same as dividing by 3.125 * 10^5, so as we did before. But maybe another way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since decimals are base 10, perhaps I can write the original fraction as follows:\n\n21 / (2² * 5⁷) = 21 / (2² * 5² * 5^5) = 21 / [(2*5)^2 * 5^5] = 21 / [10^2 * 5^5] = (21 / 5^5) / 10^2. \n\nWe know 5^5 is 3125, so 21 divided by 3125, then divided by 100. Let me compute 21 / 3125 first. \n\nWell, 3125 goes into 21 zero times. Add decimal points and zeros. Let me perform the division step by step.\n\n21.00000 divided by 3125.\n\nSince 3125 is larger than 21, we write it as 0. and proceed.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10^something to make it easier? Alternatively, note that 1/3125 is 0.00032, as we saw earlier. Therefore, 21*(1/3125) is 21*0.00032 = 0.00672. Then divide by 100 (since we had /10^2) gives 0.00672 / 100 = 0.0000672. Yep, same result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, I get 0.0000672. Let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem, maybe by simplifying the exponents first.\n\nOriginal fraction: 21/(2² * 5⁷). Let me note that 2² * 5² = 10², so maybe separate that out:\n\n21 / [ (2² * 5²) * 5^5 ] = 21 / [10² * 5^5]. As above. Then 5^5 is 3125, so 21/(100 * 3125) = 21 / 312500. Which again is same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the original fraction as 21 * 2^(-2) * 5^(-7). Then, combining the exponents:\n\nSince 2^(-2) * 5^(-7) = 2^(-2 - (-5)) * (2^(-5) * 5^(-5))? Wait, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I can think of it as 2^(-2) * 5^(-7) = 2^(-2) * 5^(-2) * 5^(-5) = (2*5)^(-2) * 5^(-5) = 10^(-2) * 5^(-5). Which again leads back to same expression. \n\nAlternatively, maybe convert the exponents into decimal equivalents. For example, 5^(-1) is 0.2, 5^(-2) is 0.04, etc. But that might get complicated. Let me try.\n\nOriginal fraction: 21 * 2^(-2) * 5^(-7). Let's compute 2^(-2) is 1/4 = 0.25, and 5^(-7) is 1/78125 ≈ 0.0000128. Then multiplying 0.25 * 0.0000128 = 0.0000032, then multiplying by 21: 21 * 0.0000032 = 0.0000672. Yep, same answer. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, I keep getting 0.0000672. Let me check if that decimal is correctly placed. Let me count the decimal places again. \n\nIf we have 672 divided by 10^7, which is 10 million. 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 672 / 10,000,000. Let me write that as 0.0000672. Let me count the decimal places. Starting from 672.0, moving decimal seven places left:\n\n1: 67.2\n\n2: 6.72\n\n3: 0.672\n\n4: 0.0672\n\n5: 0.00672\n\n6: 0.000672\n\n7: 0.0000672\n\nYes, exactly. So seven decimal places. Therefore, 0.0000672 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, to make sure there are no leading zeros missed or misplaced decimals, let me write out the decimal places:\n\nThe number is 672 / 10^7. Let me think of 1/10^7 as 0.0000001. Therefore, 672 * 0.0000001 = 0.0000672. Because multiplying 672 by 0.0000001 shifts the decimal point seven places to the left. \n\nYes, 672.0000000\n\nShift decimal seven left:\n\nFirst shift: 67.2\n\nSecond: 6.72\n\nThird: 0.672\n\nFourth: 0.0672\n\nFifth: 0.00672\n\nSixth: 0.000672\n\nSeventh: 0.0000672\n\nYes, that's seven shifts. Therefore, correct. \n\nTherefore, I think I can be confident that 21 divided by (2² * 5⁷) is equal to 0.0000672. \n\nJust to recap, the key idea was recognizing that since the denominator is a product of only 2s and 5s, the decimal terminates. Then, by adjusting the denominator to be a power of 10 through multiplication by 2^5, we can easily convert the fraction by moving the decimal point. Alternatively, by breaking down the denominator into 10^2 * 5^5 and then performing division step by step, we arrive at the same decimal. All methods converge to 0.0000672. \n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and multiple methods have confirmed the same result. Therefore, I can conclude that the decimal representation is 0.0000672.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe terminating decimal is \\boxed{0.0000672}.\n</think>"}
