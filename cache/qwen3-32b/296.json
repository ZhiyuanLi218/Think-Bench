Let me start by recalling what the problem says. The reaction given is two deuterium nuclei (which is ²H, right?) fusing together to form helium-3 and a neutron. The equation is written as:\n\n₁²H⁺ + ₁²H → ³He + ⁰¹n\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the equation again. The problem says the reaction is ²H⁺ + ²H → ³He + ¹n. Hmm, but deuterium has one proton and one neutron. If two deuterium nuclei fuse, the total number of protons and neutrons should add up. Let me verify the reaction equation.\n\nLeft side: two deuterium nuclei. Each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons: 2, total neutrons: 2.\n\nRight side: ³He has 2 protons and 1 neutron (since helium-3 has 2 protons and 1 neutron), and a neutron (¹n). So total protons: 2, total neutrons: 1 (from He-3) + 1 (from neutron) = 2. That matches the left side. So the reaction equation is balanced in terms of nucleons. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is about calculating the energy released. For that, I need to use the mass defect and Einstein's equation E=Δmc². The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products. The energy released is then that mass defect multiplied by c². But since the masses are given in atomic mass units (u), and we have a conversion factor from u to MeV/c², which is 1 u = 931 MeV/c². So I can compute the mass defect in u, then multiply by 931 MeV/u to get the energy in MeV.\n\nLet me write down the given masses:\n\n- Mass of ²H (deuterium): 2.0136 u\n- Mass of ³He: 3.0150 u\n- Mass of neutron (¹n): 1.0087 u\n\nWait, but there are two deuterium nuclei on the left side. So total mass of the reactants is 2 * 2.0136 u. The products are one ³He and one neutron. So total mass of products is 3.0150 u + 1.0087 u.\n\nLet me compute these numbers.\n\nFirst, total mass of reactants:\n\n2 * 2.0136 u = 4.0272 u\n\nTotal mass of products:\n\n3.0150 u + 1.0087 u = 4.0237 u\n\nSo the mass defect Δm is mass_reactants - mass_products = 4.0272 u - 4.0237 u = 0.0035 u\n\nThen, the energy released is Δm * 931 MeV/u = 0.0035 u * 931 MeV/u ≈ ?\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.0035 * 931. Let's see:\n\nFirst, 0.003 * 931 = 2.793 MeV\n\nThen 0.0005 * 931 = 0.4655 MeV\n\nAdding them together: 2.793 + 0.4655 ≈ 3.2585 MeV\n\nSo approximately 3.26 MeV. Looking at the options, the closest one is (B) 3.3 MeV.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again for any possible errors.\n\nFirst, mass of reactants: two deuterium atoms. Each is 2.0136 u. So 2.0136 * 2 = 4.0272 u. Correct.\n\nMass of products: ³He is 3.0150 u and neutron is 1.0087 u. Adding them: 3.0150 + 1.0087. Let me add 3.0150 + 1.0087:\n\n3.0150 + 1.0087 = 4.0237 u. Correct.\n\nDifference: 4.0272 - 4.0237 = 0.0035 u. Correct.\n\nMultiply by 931 MeV/c² per u: 0.0035 * 931.\n\nLet me compute 931 * 0.0035:\n\nWell, 931 * 0.0035 = 931 * (3.5 × 10⁻³) = ?\n\nAlternatively, 3.5 × 931 / 1000.\n\nBut 3.5 × 931:\n\nLet me compute 3 * 931 = 2793, 0.5 * 931 = 465.5, so total is 2793 + 465.5 = 3258.5, then divide by 1000: 3.2585 MeV. So approximately 3.26 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options: (A) 3.7, (B) 3.3, (C) 2.7, (D) 0.93. So 3.26 is closest to option B, 3.3 MeV. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in the reaction equation. Wait, the problem says it's a tritium nuclear fusion reaction. Wait, hold on. Wait, tritium is ³H, which is a hydrogen isotope with two neutrons. But the reaction given is deuterium (²H) plus deuterium (²H) → helium-3 (³He) plus neutron. So that's deuterium-deuterium fusion, producing helium-3 and a neutron. But tritium isn't directly involved here. Wait, the problem says \"tritium nuclear fusion reaction\". Is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the problem has a typo? Because tritium is ³H, not ²H. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem says: \"the tritium nuclear fusion reaction equation is: ₁²H⁺ ₁²H → ³He + ¹n\". Wait, so the equation is deuterium plus deuterium. But tritium is ³H. So why is it called a tritium nuclear fusion reaction? Maybe that's a mistranslation or a misnomer. Maybe the problem is referring to the reaction involving tritium in some way? Or perhaps it's a translation error. For example, maybe \"tritium\" here is being used incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \"deuterium-tritium\" fusion? Or maybe the problem is referring to the fact that tritium is produced in the process?\n\nWait, let's think. The reaction given is deuterium-deuterium fusion. The products are helium-3 and a neutron. But in reality, there are different deuterium-deuterium fusion reactions. For example, another possible product is tritium plus a proton. But in this case, the problem states that the products are helium-3 and neutron. So the reaction is D + D → He-3 + n. This is one of the possible D-D fusion reactions, yes. The other is D + D → T + p, which produces tritium and a proton. But in this case, the problem is referring to the reaction producing helium-3 and neutron. However, the problem mentions it's a \"tritium nuclear fusion reaction\". That seems conflicting because tritium isn't in the reaction. Maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe the problem is referring to tritium being involved in another step of the process? Or perhaps mistranslation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the overall process of the \"Artificial Sun\" project, which might involve tritium in other reactions. But for the specific reaction given, it's deuterium-deuterium fusion. Since the question gives the reaction equation, perhaps regardless of the name, we should just proceed with the given equation.\n\nAssuming that the reaction equation is correct as given, then my calculation of 3.26 MeV is correct, leading to option B. However, let me check if there's another way the problem might be approached, perhaps considering binding energies or something else, but I don't think so. The standard way is to calculate the mass defect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the number of particles? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"tritium nuclear fusion reaction\", but tritium is ³H. However, the equation given is ²H + ²H → ³He + n. So tritium isn't involved here. Maybe there's confusion between tritium and helium-3? Or perhaps a translation issue? For example, in Chinese, maybe the term used for \"tritium\" is being misapplied here. But since the reaction equation is given, we have to go by that. So I think the problem might have a misnomer, but the calculation is based on the given equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the tritium being produced in another reaction, but for the specific reaction given, it's D-D fusion. So proceeding with that.\n\nAnother thing to check: the masses given. Let me verify the masses. The problem says:\n\n- ²H mass is 2.0136 u. That seems correct. The actual atomic mass of deuterium (²H) is about 2.014101778 u, but the problem gives 2.0136. Close enough for this problem's purposes.\n\n- ³He mass is 3.0150 u. The actual atomic mass of ³He is approximately 3.0160293 u. The problem's value is 3.0150, which is a bit lower, but again, for the sake of the problem, we have to use the given numbers.\n\n- Neutron mass is 1.0087 u. The actual neutron mass is about 1.008664 u, so the problem's value is 1.0087, which is accurate.\n\nSo the given masses are approximate, but we have to use them.\n\nSo using the given numbers:\n\nMass of reactants: 2 * 2.0136 = 4.0272 u\n\nMass of products: 3.0150 + 1.0087 = 4.0237 u\n\nMass defect: 4.0272 - 4.0237 = 0.0035 u\n\nEnergy: 0.0035 u * 931 MeV/u ≈ 3.2585 MeV ≈ 3.26 MeV.\n\nWhich rounds to 3.3 MeV, so option B. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n\nBut let me check if there's any chance I miscalculated the mass defect. Let me subtract again:\n\n4.0272 minus 4.0237:\n\n4.0272  \n-4.0237  \n= 0.0035. Yes, correct.\n\nAnother thing: sometimes in nuclear reactions, you have to consider the binding energy or the difference between atomic masses and nuclear masses, but since all the masses are given here (assuming they are atomic masses), and the reaction is between nuclei, but since the problem provides the masses directly, we can just use them as given.\n\nWait, but in reality, when dealing with nuclear reactions, we need to consider whether the masses given are atomic masses or nuclear masses. Because atomic masses include electrons. However, in this case, the reaction is between two deuterium nuclei (which are ions, as indicated by the + charge on the first ²H?), but the problem statement has a strange notation: it says ₁²H⁺ stacked with ₂¹H? Wait, looking back at the original problem:\n\nThe reaction equation is written as: ₁²H⁺ ₂¹H → ³He + ¹n. Wait, maybe there was a formatting issue. The original LaTeX is:\n\n{}_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\stackrel{2}{1} \\mathrm{H} \\rightarrow {}^{3} \\mathrm{He} + {}^{1} \\mathrm{n}\n\nHmm, the notation might be a bit messed up. Let me parse it.\n\nFirst term: {}_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}^{+}: that's a deuterium nucleus (isotope with A=2, Z=1) with a + charge, so a deuterium ion missing one electron.\n\nSecond term: \\stackrel{2}{1} \\mathrm{H}: This is a bit unclear. Normally, isotopes are written with the mass number as a superscript on the left. The \\stackrel{2}{1} would place a 2 above a 1, which might be intended to represent the same as {}_{1}^{2}H. So perhaps it's another deuterium nucleus. So the reaction is D + D → He-3 + n. So two deuterium nuclei fusing into He-3 and a neutron.\n\nAssuming that, then the calculation is correct. The charges on the nuclei might affect the calculation if we were considering electrons, but since we are given the masses of the nuclei or the atomic masses, and the problem provides the masses directly, I think we can proceed as before.\n\nBut let's consider if there are electrons involved. For example, if the given masses are atomic masses (which include electrons), then when we have a deuterium ion (H⁺), which is a bare nucleus (proton + neutron), whereas the other deuterium is neutral, having one electron. But this would complicate the mass calculation because of the different number of electrons. However, given that the problem provides the masses of ²H as 2.0136 u, which is likely the atomic mass (since isotopic masses are usually given as atomic masses), and if one of the deuterium is ionized (H⁺) and the other is neutral, then there would be a discrepancy in the number of electrons. But since the problem is probably intended for high school or introductory college level, it's likely that we are to ignore such subtleties and treat all masses as given, regardless of charge.\n\nMoreover, in nuclear reactions, typically the masses used are nuclear masses, but since those are not commonly tabulated, atomic masses are used instead, and adjustments are made for the electrons. However, in this problem, since the reaction is between two deuterium nuclei (assuming they are both ions, as in a plasma), and the products are a He-3 nucleus and a neutron, the electron binding is not part of the nuclear reaction. However, if the given masses are atomic masses, then we need to adjust for the electrons. But given that the problem does not provide any information about electron masses or binding energies, we must assume that the given masses are the appropriate ones for the calculation, i.e., either all nuclear masses or all atomic masses with the electron effects already accounted for.\n\nSince the problem gives the mass of ²H as 2.0136 u, which is the atomic mass, and the same for ³He and neutron. But if we are considering the nuclear masses, we would have to subtract the mass of the electrons. However, since the reaction involves two deuterium atoms (assuming they are neutral), but one is written as H⁺ (a bare nucleus), there would be an inconsistency. But again, given that this is likely a simplification for the problem, and given that the calculation works out with the given numbers to give 3.26 MeV, which matches option B, I think we can safely proceed with the calculation as done.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option B, 3.3 MeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
