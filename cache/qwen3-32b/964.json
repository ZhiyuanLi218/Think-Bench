First, I need to recall what 2-phenylpropene is. The name suggests it's an alkene with a phenyl group attached to the second carbon of a propene chain. So the structure would be CH2=CH-Ph, where Ph is the phenyl group (C6H5). Wait, actually, propene is three carbons: CH2=CH2, but with a phenyl on the second carbon. So maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH2Ph)? No, wait, the position is important. The correct IUPAC name would be 2-phenylpropene, so the propene is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the phenyl is on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2Ph)? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. If the phenyl is on the second carbon, then it's CH2=C(C6H5)CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The parent chain is propene (three carbons with a double bond between C1 and C2). The substituent is a phenyl group on carbon 2. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2Ph)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. If we add a phenyl group to the central carbon (C2), then the structure would be CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. But wait, the correct IUPAC name for that would be 2-phenylpropene. So yes, that's the structure. So the molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2, and a phenyl group on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3? Or is it CH2=CH-C6H5? Wait, no, that would be styrene. Styrene is phenyl ethylene, which is CH2=CH-C6H5. But the question is about 2-phenylpropene. Hmm. Let me check. The correct structure of 2-phenylpropene is CH2=C(CH2Ph)CH3? Or maybe the phenyl is directly attached to the double bond. Wait, the correct IUPAC name would be based on the longest chain. If the parent chain is propene (three carbons), then the phenyl is on C2. So the structure would be CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. But that would be 2-phenylpropene. Alternatively, if the phenyl is on the first carbon, it would be 1-phenylpropene, which would be Ph-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's more complicated. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. Wait, but in that case, the phenyl is on the central carbon of the propene. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CH2=CH-C6H5, which is styrene. But the name 2-phenylpropene suggests that the phenyl is on the second carbon of the propene chain. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. However, I think that's not correct. Wait, maybe the parent chain is three carbons with a double bond, and the phenyl is attached to the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(C6H5)CH2? No, that would be four carbons. Wait, propene is three carbons. Let me draw it out mentally. Carbon 1: CH2-, carbon 2: CH-, with a double bond between 1 and 2, and a phenyl on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3? Wait, that would be three carbons: the first is CH2, the second is C (with a double bond to the first and a single bond to the third carbon CH3 and the phenyl group). So yes, that's 2-phenylpropene. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. Alternatively, maybe the phenyl is on the first carbon? No, the question says 2-phenyl. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. \n\nNow, the options given are A to D. Let's analyze each one.\n\nOption A: Cannot decolorize dilute potassium permanganate solution. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in dilute solution is a mild oxidizing agent. For alkenes, KMnO4 can oxidize the double bond under certain conditions. If the solution is dilute and perhaps under acidic or neutral conditions, the reaction may produce diols (syn addition) or cleave the double bond. However, if the alkene is conjugated with a benzene ring, maybe the reaction is different. Wait, in 2-phenylpropene, the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and there's a phenyl group on C2. The presence of the phenyl group might affect the reactivity. But regardless, alkenes generally can decolorize KMnO4 solution because the MnO4^- is reduced, causing the purple color to fade. So if the compound has a double bond, it should decolorize KMnO4. So option A says it cannot, which would be incorrect. Therefore, A is false.\n\nOption B: Can undergo addition polymerization reaction. Alkenes can undergo addition polymerization. Since 2-phenylpropene has a double bond, it should be able to polymerize. However, the presence of the phenyl group might affect the ease of polymerization. But in general, alkenes with substituents can still polymerize. For example, styrene (which is similar, with a phenyl group on the double bond) can polymerize. So 2-phenylpropene should also be able to undergo addition polymerization. Therefore, B is correct.\n\nOption C: All atoms in the molecule are coplanar. For this, we need to consider the geometry of the molecule. The phenyl group is a benzene ring, which is planar. The double bond in the alkene (CH2=C(C6H5)CH3) is also planar. However, the rest of the molecule (the CH3 group attached to the C2) is not in the same plane. The double bond has a trigonal planar geometry around each carbon. The phenyl group is attached to the C2 of the double bond. The CH3 is attached to the same C2. So the phenyl group and the CH3 are both on the same carbon (C2). The phenyl group is planar, but the CH3 is a tetrahedral group. However, the question is about all atoms in the molecule being coplanar. The double bond and the phenyl group are likely to be in the same plane because of conjugation or steric factors? Wait, the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. The phenyl is on the C2 (the double bond carbon). The CH2 is on C1, and the CH3 is on C2. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The phenyl is attached to C2. The phenyl ring is planar, and the double bond is also planar. However, whether they are in the same plane depends on the possibility of conjugation. If the phenyl is conjugated with the double bond, the planes might be aligned. However, in 2-phenylpropene, the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. The phenyl is attached to the C2 (the double bond carbon), but there's a single bond between the C2 and the phenyl. So the phenyl can rotate around that single bond, unless there's some conjugation. Wait, if there's conjugation, the double bond and the phenyl ring could be in the same plane. But in this case, the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. The C2 has a double bond to C1, a single bond to the phenyl, and a single bond to the CH3. Since there's only one double bond and the phenyl is attached via a single bond, there's no conjugation. Therefore, the phenyl ring can rotate freely around the single bond, so the phenyl ring and the double bond may not be coplanar. Therefore, not all atoms are coplanar. The CH3 is definitely not coplanar. So option C is incorrect. Therefore, C is false.\n\nOption D: Easily soluble in water and toluene. Solubility in water depends on the polarity. Since 2-phenylpropene is a nonpolar molecule (alkene and phenyl group are both nonpolar), it would not be soluble in water. Water is polar and forms hydrogen bonds, so nonpolar compounds are not soluble. Toluene is a nonpolar solvent, so the compound should be soluble in toluene. Therefore, option D says it's easily soluble in both, which is incorrect. So D is false.\n\nSo the correct options are B. Let me double-check each one.\n\nA: Cannot decolorize KMnO4. Since it has a double bond, it should decolorize KMnO4. So A is incorrect.\n\nB: Can undergo addition polymerization. Yes, because of the double bond. Correct.\n\nC: All atoms coplanar. No, because of the CH3 and rotation. Incorrect.\n\nD: Soluble in water and toluene. Only toluene. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n</think>"}
