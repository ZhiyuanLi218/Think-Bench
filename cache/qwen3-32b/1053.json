I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll take it step by step. Let me start by recalling what each of these statements is saying and then check them against what I know about acid-base equilibria and solution chemistry.\n\nStarting with option (a): In a 0.1 mol/L H3PO4 solution, the concentration order is H3PO4 > H2PO4^- > HPO4^2- > PO4^3-. \n\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons in solution. Each deprotonation step has its own dissociation constant. The first dissociation (H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-) has a Ka1, the second (H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-) has a Ka2, and the third (HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-) has a Ka3. \n\nI remember that for polyprotic acids, the first dissociation constant (Ka1) is much larger than the second (Ka2), which is larger than the third (Ka3). So, each subsequent deprotonation is less likely to occur. Therefore, in a solution of H3PO4, the majority of the acid will remain in the H3PO4 form, with some H2PO4^- and very little HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. \n\nThe statement says that the concentration of H3PO4 is greater than H2PO4^-, which is greater than HPO4^2-, which is greater than PO4^3-. Given that each subsequent species is formed in smaller amounts, this order seems plausible. So, option (a) might be correct. Let me just check the typical Ka values to confirm. \n\nFor H3PO4: Ka1 ≈ 7.5 × 10^-3, Ka2 ≈ 6.2 × 10^-8, Ka3 ≈ 4.8 × 10^-13. These values are from memory, but they show that each step is significantly weaker. So yes, the concentration order should follow H3PO4 > H2PO4^- > HPO4^2- > PO4^3-. Therefore, statement (a) is correct.\n\nMoving on to option (b): In a 0.1 mol/L Na2SO4 solution, the equation given is C(Na+) + C(H+) = C(HSO4^-) + 2C(SO4^2-). \n\nWait, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) is a salt that dissociates completely in water into 2 Na+ and SO4^2-. However, the sulfate ion (SO4^2-) can act as a weak base and hydrolyze in water to form HSO4^- and OH^-: \n\nSO4^2- + H2O ⇌ HSO4^- + OH^- \n\nBut since Na2SO4 is a strong electrolyte, the Na+ ions are fully dissociated. The sulfate ion, however, is the conjugate base of HSO4^-, which is a weak acid. The hydrolysis of sulfate is likely minimal because the Kb for sulfate would be very small (since HSO4^- is a stronger acid than water). \n\nNow, looking at the charge balance equation. In any aqueous solution, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges. For sodium sulfate solution, the main ions would be Na+, HSO4^- (from hydrolysis), SO4^2-, and possibly some H+ and OH^- from water autoionization. \n\nBut the given equation is C(Na+) + C(H+) = C(HSO4^-) + 2C(SO4^2-). Let me think about the charge balance. \n\nThe charge balance equation should be:\n\n[Na+] + [H+] = [HSO4^-] + 2[SO4^2-] + [OH^-]\n\nBut the given equation omits [OH^-]. Also, in a sodium sulfate solution, since sulfate is a weak base, the solution should be slightly basic, so [OH^-] would be greater than [H+]. However, if the hydrolysis is negligible, then maybe [HSO4^-] is negligible and [OH^-] is also negligible. But the equation given in option (b) doesn't include [OH^-], so it's incomplete. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that in a Na2SO4 solution, the sulfate ion doesn't hydrolyze (which isn't true, but if we assume that, then HSO4^- concentration is zero and OH^- is also negligible). But even so, the charge balance would need to account for all ions. \n\nLet me calculate the concentrations. For 0.1 mol/L Na2SO4, each formula unit gives 2 Na+ and 1 SO4^2-. So [Na+] = 0.2 M. Assuming no hydrolysis, [SO4^2-] = 0.1 M, and [HSO4^-] ≈ 0. Then the charge balance would be [Na+] + [H+] = 2[SO4^2-] + [OH^-]. But since [H+] and [OH^-] are both very small (assuming no hydrolysis), they might be neglected. However, the equation given in (b) is [Na+] + [H+] = [HSO4^-] + 2[SO4^2-]. This is missing [OH^-] on the right side. \n\nTherefore, the equation in option (b) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the hydroxide ions. Hence, option (b) is incorrect.\n\nOption (c): In a 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 solution, the concentration order is H2CO3 > HCO3^- > CO3^2-.\n\nSodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) dissociates completely into Na+ and HCO3^-. The bicarbonate ion (HCO3^-) is amphiprotic, meaning it can act as an acid or a base. \n\nIn solution, HCO3^- can donate a proton to form CO3^2- or accept a proton to form H2CO3. The relevant equilibrium reactions are:\n\nHCO3^- ⇌ H+ + CO3^2- (Ka2)\n\nHCO3^- + H2O ⇌ H2CO3 + OH^- (Kb)\n\nThe Ka for the second deprotonation of carbonic acid (H2CO3) is around 4.7 × 10^-11, while the Kb for HCO3^- can be calculated from Kw/Ka1, where Ka1 is the first dissociation constant of H2CO3 (~4.3 × 10^-7). So Kb = Kw / Ka1 ≈ 1e-14 / 4.3e-7 ≈ 2.3e-8. \n\nSince Kb (2.3e-8) is larger than Ka2 (4.7e-11), this means that HCO3^- is more likely to act as a base (accepting a proton to form H2CO3) than as an acid (donating a proton to form CO3^2-). Therefore, in a solution of NaHCO3, the concentration of H2CO3 should be higher than that of CO3^2-.\n\nBut what about the concentration of HCO3^- itself? In a 0.1 M solution of NaHCO3, the main species is HCO3^-, with some H2CO3 formed from hydrolysis and some CO3^2- from dissociation. Since Kb > Ka2, the hydrolysis (formation of H2CO3) is more significant than the dissociation into CO3^2-. However, the exact concentrations depend on the extent of these reactions.\n\nBut the statement says that [H2CO3] > [HCO3^-] > [CO3^2-]. Wait, that would mean that the concentration of H2CO3 is higher than the original concentration of HCO3^-. But the original concentration of HCO3^- is 0.1 M. However, since HCO3^- is hydrolyzing to form H2CO3, but the extent of hydrolysis is limited because Kb is 2.3e-8. Let me do a rough calculation.\n\nLet’s denote the concentration of HCO3^- as 0.1 M initially. Let’s assume that x is the concentration of H2CO3 formed. Then:\n\nKb = [H2CO3][OH^-]/[HCO3^-]\n\nBut since Kb is small, x will be small compared to 0.1, so we can approximate [HCO3^-] ≈ 0.1 M. Also, [H2CO3] ≈ x, and [OH^-] ≈ x. So:\n\nKb ≈ x^2 / 0.1 => x ≈ sqrt(0.1 * Kb) = sqrt(0.1 * 2.3e-8) ≈ sqrt(2.3e-9) ≈ 4.8e-5 M.\n\nSo [H2CO3] ≈ 4.8e-5 M, which is much less than 0.1 M. Therefore, [HCO3^-] is still much higher than [H2CO3]. So the order should be [HCO3^-] > [H2CO3] > [CO3^2-]. But the statement in (c) says [H2CO3] > [HCO3^-], which contradicts this. Therefore, option (c) is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The statement in (c) is: In a 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 solution, C(H2CO3) > C(HCO3^-) > C(CO3^2-). But according to my calculation, [H2CO3] is about 4.8e-5 M, while [HCO3^-] is approximately 0.1 M. So [HCO3^-] is much larger than [H2CO3], which means the order should be [HCO3^-] > [H2CO3] > [CO3^2-]. Therefore, option (c) is incorrect because it claims [H2CO3] > [HCO3^-], which is not true. So option (c) is wrong.\n\nMoving to option (d): Ammonia solution and CH3Cl mixed, forming a solution with pH=9, where [Cl^-] > [NH4^+] > [OH^-].\n\nFirst, let's parse this. Ammonia (NH3) is a weak base, and CH3Cl is chloromethane. Wait, but chloromethane is a neutral molecule. However, the notation might be a typo or maybe it's supposed to be NH4Cl? Because Cl^- is mentioned. If it's NH4Cl, then when mixed with ammonia, you get a buffer solution. Let me think.\n\nAssuming that the question refers to mixing ammonia (NH3) and NH4Cl (ammonium chloride), which would form a buffer solution. If the pH is 9, then we can analyze the concentrations.\n\nIn a buffer solution of NH3 and NH4Cl, the major species are NH3, NH4^+, Cl^-, and some OH^- from the base. The Cl^- comes from the dissociation of NH4Cl, which is a strong electrolyte. So [Cl^-] should be equal to the concentration of NH4Cl added.\n\nThe NH3 is a weak base: NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4^+ + OH^-\n\nThe NH4^+ from NH4Cl will suppress the dissociation of NH3 due to the common ion effect. \n\nIn such a buffer solution, the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])\n\nHere, the base is NH3 and the acid is NH4^+. The pKa of NH4^+ is around 9.25 (since pKb of NH3 is 4.75, so pKa = 14 - 4.75 = 9.25). If the pH is 9, which is less than pKa, then the ratio [base]/[acid] is less than 1, meaning [NH4^+] > [NH3]. \n\nBut the question states that [Cl^-] > [NH4^+] > [OH^-]. Let's check if this is possible.\n\nFirst, [Cl^-] comes from NH4Cl. If the solution is made by mixing NH3 and NH4Cl, then [Cl^-] = [NH4Cl] added. The [NH4^+] comes from both NH4Cl and the dissociation of NH3. However, since NH4Cl is a strong electrolyte, [NH4^+] ≈ [NH4Cl] + [NH4^+] from NH3. But if the solution is a buffer, the [NH4^+] is mainly from NH4Cl. However, the exact relationship depends on the concentrations of NH3 and NH4Cl.\n\nBut the question says the solution has pH=9. Let's consider the buffer equation again. pH = 9, pKa = 9.25. So:\n\n9 = 9.25 + log([NH3]/[NH4^+])\n\nlog([NH3]/[NH4^+]) = -0.25\n\n[NH3]/[NH4^+] = 10^(-0.25) ≈ 0.56. So [NH3] ≈ 0.56 [NH4^+]. Therefore, [NH4^+] > [NH3]. \n\nBut how does [NH4^+] compare to [Cl^-]? If the solution is made by adding NH4Cl and NH3, then [Cl^-] = [NH4Cl] added. Assuming that the solution is made by mixing equimolar amounts or some other ratio, but without specific concentrations, it's hard to say. However, in a typical buffer solution, if you have more NH4Cl than NH3, then [NH4^+] would be higher than [NH3], and [Cl^-] would be equal to the concentration of NH4Cl. \n\nBut the question states [Cl^-] > [NH4^+]. Wait, if [Cl^-] comes from NH4Cl, and [NH4^+] comes from NH4Cl plus a bit from NH3, then [NH4^+] should be slightly higher than [Cl^-]. Unless there's some other source of NH4^+? No, because NH3 is a weak base and contributes very little NH4^+ compared to NH4Cl. Therefore, [NH4^+] ≈ [NH4Cl] = [Cl^-]. But the question says [Cl^-] > [NH4^+], which would imply that [NH4Cl] > [NH4^+], which is not possible unless there's some other factor. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me think again. If the solution is made by mixing NH3 and NH4Cl, then:\n\n[NH4^+] = [NH4Cl] + [NH4^+] from NH3 dissociation.\n\nBut since NH3 is a weak base, the amount of NH4^+ from its dissociation is negligible compared to that from NH4Cl. Therefore, [NH4^+] ≈ [NH4Cl] = [Cl^-]. Therefore, [NH4^+] ≈ [Cl^-]. However, the question says [Cl^-] > [NH4^+], which would only be true if there's some other source of Cl^- or if the NH4^+ is consumed. But in a buffer solution, NH4^+ is from NH4Cl and the NH3 doesn't consume it. Therefore, this seems contradictory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution is not made by mixing NH3 and NH4Cl, but by some other method. Wait, the question says \"ammonia solution and CH3Cl mixed\". Wait, CH3Cl is chloromethane, a neutral molecule. Chloromethane is not an ionic compound and doesn't dissociate in water. So if you mix ammonia (NH3) with CH3Cl, you would have a solution with NH3 and CH3Cl. But CH3Cl is not a source of Cl^- ions. Therefore, the presence of Cl^- in the solution is confusing. Unless there's a typo and it's supposed to be NH4Cl instead of CH3Cl. \n\nIf the question has a typo and it's NH4Cl (ammonium chloride) instead of CH3Cl, then the analysis would make sense. In that case, the solution would have Cl^- from NH4Cl, NH4^+ from NH4Cl and NH3, and OH^- from the base. Then, in a buffer solution with pH=9, as discussed earlier, [NH4^+] ≈ [Cl^-], so the statement [Cl^-] > [NH4^+] would not hold unless there's more NH4Cl than NH4^+... Wait, no, if you have NH4Cl dissociating into NH4^+ and Cl^-, then [NH4^+] should be equal to [Cl^-] if there's no other source or sink for NH4^+. \n\nBut the question says [Cl^-] > [NH4^+]. This would only happen if some NH4^+ is converted into something else. For example, if there's a reaction that consumes NH4^+, but in a buffer solution, NH4^+ is in equilibrium with NH3 and H+. Unless there's another reaction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution is not a buffer but a solution of NH3 and some other compound. But if it's NH3 and CH3Cl, which is neutral, then Cl^- wouldn't be present. So this seems like a problem. \n\nGiven that the question mentions Cl^- in the solution, but CH3Cl doesn't provide Cl^-, it's likely a typo and should be NH4Cl. Assuming that, then let's proceed. \n\nIf the solution is made by mixing NH3 and NH4Cl, then [Cl^-] = [NH4Cl] added. The [NH4^+] is approximately equal to [NH4Cl] because NH3 contributes negligible NH4^+. Therefore, [Cl^-] ≈ [NH4^+]. However, the statement says [Cl^-] > [NH4^+], which would require that [NH4Cl] > [NH4^+], which isn't possible unless there's some other factor. \n\nWait, unless the NH4^+ is partially neutralized by OH^-? But in a basic solution (pH=9), there's excess OH^-, but NH4^+ is a weak acid and would react with OH^-: NH4^+ + OH^- ⇌ NH3 + H2O. However, in a buffer solution, the concentrations are such that this reaction is minimal. The buffer resists changes in pH, so even though there's OH^-, the amount of NH4^+ reacting would be small. \n\nLet me calculate the concentrations. Suppose the solution is a buffer with pH=9, made from NH3 and NH4Cl. Let's assume that the concentration of NH4Cl is higher than NH3 to get pH < pKa. \n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again:\n\npH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])\n\n9 = 9.25 + log([NH3]/[NH4^+])\n\nlog([NH3]/[NH4^+]) = -0.25 => [NH3]/[NH4^+] ≈ 0.56 => [NH3] ≈ 0.56 [NH4^+]\n\nThis means that [NH4^+] is about 1.78 times [NH3]. \n\nBut [Cl^-] comes from NH4Cl, so if the solution is made by adding NH4Cl and NH3, then [Cl^-] = [NH4Cl] added. Let's denote [NH4Cl] = x and [NH3] = y. Then, [NH4^+] in solution is x + (some from NH3 dissociation). But since NH3 is a weak base, the amount of NH4^+ from it is negligible compared to x. Therefore, [NH4^+] ≈ x. \n\nBut from the ratio, [NH3]/[NH4^+] ≈ 0.56 => y/x ≈ 0.56 => y ≈ 0.56x. \n\nSo [Cl^-] = x, [NH4^+] ≈ x, [NH3] ≈ 0.56x. \n\nTherefore, [Cl^-] ≈ [NH4^+], so the statement [Cl^-] > [NH4^+] would not hold unless x > x, which is not possible. Therefore, the statement in option (d) is incorrect. \n\nHowever, if there's some other source of NH4^+ consumption, but in a buffer solution, it's unlikely. Alternatively, if the solution is not a buffer but something else. \n\nBut given the presence of Cl^- and NH4^+, and assuming it's NH4Cl and NH3, then [Cl^-] ≈ [NH4^+], so the statement [Cl^-] > [NH4^+] is false. Hence, option (d) is incorrect. \n\nWait, but the question says \"ammonia solution and CH3Cl mixed\". If it's actually CH3Cl (chloromethane), then there's no Cl^- in the solution. So this must be a typo. Given that the option (d) mentions Cl^-, it's likely supposed to be NH4Cl instead of CH3Cl. Assuming that, then as we saw, [Cl^-] ≈ [NH4^+], so the statement is incorrect. \n\nBut let's also check the other part of the statement: [NH4^+] > [OH^-]. At pH=9, [OH^-] = 1e-5 M (since pH=9 means [H+]=1e-9, [OH^-]=1e-5). Now, [NH4^+] in the buffer is approximately equal to [NH4Cl], which depends on the concentrations. For example, if we have a 0.1 M NH4Cl and 0.056 M NH3, then [NH4^+] ≈ 0.1 M, which is much greater than [OH^-] (1e-5 M). So [NH4^+] > [OH^-] is true. \n\nBut the first part of the statement, [Cl^-] > [NH4^+], is false. Therefore, option (d) is incorrect. \n\nWait, but if the solution is made with excess NH4Cl, then [Cl^-] would equal [NH4Cl], and [NH4^+] would be [NH4Cl] plus a little from NH3. So [Cl^-] would be slightly less than [NH4^+], not greater. Therefore, the statement [Cl^-] > [NH4^+] is incorrect. \n\nThus, option (d) is incorrect. \n\nSo, after analyzing all options:\n\n(a) is correct.\n\n(b) is incorrect.\n\n(c) is incorrect.\n\n(d) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (a).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe correct statement is \\boxed{a}.\n</think>"}
