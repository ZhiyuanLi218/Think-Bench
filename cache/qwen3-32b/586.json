The question is asking about the heat transfer during the process, given that the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings. The options are A to D, with different amounts of heat added or removed. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an isothermal process is. Isothermal means that the temperature remains constant. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. Since the temperature isn't changing during an isothermal process, the change in internal energy (ΔU) should be zero. That’s from the first law of thermodynamics, right? The first law is ΔU = Q - W, where Q is the heat added to the system and W is the work done by the system.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have the signs right. The first law is ΔU = Q - W, where Q is the heat added to the system and W is the work done by the system. So if the gas does work on the surroundings, that's positive W. Since ΔU is zero for isothermal, then 0 = Q - W, so Q = W. That would mean the heat added to the system is equal to the work done by the system. \n\nBut in this problem, the gas does 150 J of work. So according to this, Q should be equal to 150 J. So that would mean 150 J of heat was added to the gas. Let me check the options. Option A says 150 J added, which would be correct. But wait, let me think again. Is the work done by the gas positive or negative in the equation?\n\nLet me confirm the sign conventions. In the equation ΔU = Q - W, W is the work done by the system. So if the gas does 150 J of work, then W is +150 J. Since ΔU is zero, then Q must be equal to W. Therefore, Q is +150 J, meaning heat is added to the system. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, sometimes different textbooks might use different sign conventions. For example, some might define W as the work done on the system. But I think the standard in most physics courses is that W is work done by the system. Let me check my notes. Yeah, the first law is usually written as ΔU = Q - W, with W being work done by the system. So if the gas is expanding, it's doing work on the surroundings, so W is positive. Therefore, Q must be positive as well, meaning heat is added to the gas.\n\nBut wait, during an expansion, if the gas is doing work, and temperature is constant, how does heat come into play? Well, since the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature, and temperature is constant, the internal energy doesn't change. Therefore, all the work done by the gas must be compensated by heat flowing into the gas from the surroundings. So yes, heat is added to the gas. So option A is correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't confuse heat added or removed. If the gas is expanding isothermally, it needs to absorb heat to keep the internal energy constant while doing work. If it were compressed isothermally, it would have to expel heat. So in this case, expansion means heat is added. So 150 J of work done by the gas requires 150 J of heat added. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nI don't see any other factors here. The problem says it's an ideal gas, so no complications with real gas behavior. The process is isothermal, so temperature is constant. The calculation seems straightforward. So I think the correct answer is A: 150 J of heat was added to the gas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
