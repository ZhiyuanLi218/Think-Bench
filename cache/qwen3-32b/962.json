The question gives multiple choices, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical components of the motion can be treated separately. Since we're neglecting air resistance, the only acceleration acting on the ball after it's been kicked is due to gravity, which acts vertically downward. That means the horizontal component of the velocity remains constant throughout the flight, while the vertical component changes due to acceleration from gravity.\n\nThe key here is that the total flight time depends on the vertical motion. The ball goes up, reaches its peak, and then comes back down to the ground. The time it takes to go up is equal to the time it takes to come back down, assuming it lands at the same vertical level it was kicked from. So if I can find the time it takes for the ball to reach its peak, I can double that to get the total flight time.\n\nTo find the vertical component of the initial velocity, I need to use trigonometry. The initial velocity is 10 m/s at a 30-degree angle. The vertical component (let's call it v_y) is given by v * sin(theta), where v is the initial velocity and theta is the launch angle. So plugging in the numbers:\n\nv_y = 10 m/s * sin(30°)\n\nI remember that sin(30°) is 0.5, so:\n\nv_y = 10 * 0.5 = 5 m/s\n\nSo the vertical component of the velocity is 5 m/s. Now, I need to find the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height. At the peak, the vertical velocity becomes zero because it stops going up and starts coming down. The acceleration due to gravity is acting against the upward motion, so it's negative. The formula to use here is:\n\nv_final = v_initial + a*t\n\nWhere v_final is the final velocity (which is 0 m/s at the peak), v_initial is the initial vertical velocity (5 m/s), a is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s², negative because it's acting downward), and t is the time to reach the peak.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n0 = 5 m/s + (-9.8 m/s²) * t\n\nSolving for t:\n\n-5 m/s = -9.8 m/s² * t\n\nDivide both sides by -9.8 m/s²:\n\nt = (-5 m/s) / (-9.8 m/s²) = 5 / 9.8 ≈ 0.5102 seconds\n\nSo that's the time to reach the peak. Since the time up is equal to the time down, the total flight time is twice this value:\n\nTotal flight time = 2 * 0.5102 ≈ 1.0204 seconds\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the closest one is B: 1 s. The options given are 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 seconds. My calculation gives approximately 1.02 seconds, which is very close to 1 second. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the time to reach the peak.\n\nv_y = 5 m/s, a = -9.8 m/s².\n\nTime to reach peak: t = (v_final - v_initial)/a\n\nBut since v_final is 0, t = -v_initial / a\n\nSo t = -5 / (-9.8) = 5 / 9.8 ≈ 0.5102 s. That's correct. Then doubling that gives about 1.02 s. Given that the options are in whole numbers, 1 s is the closest. So answer B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using g = 10 m/s² for simplicity? Let me check that.\n\nIf we take g as 10 m/s² instead of 9.8, then t = 5 / 10 = 0.5 s, so total flight time is 1.0 s. That would exactly give answer B. Since in many physics problems, especially at the high school level, g is approximated as 10 m/s² for simplicity. So maybe the question expects that approximation here. In that case, the answer is exactly 1 s. Either way, whether using 9.8 or 10, the answer rounds to 1 s. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total flight time is 1 second, so the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
