Let me start by recalling Ohm's Law, which is probably the key here. Ohm's Law states that V = I * R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. So if I want to find out how current (I) changes, I can rearrange the formula to I = V / R. \n\nSo current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance. That means if voltage goes up, current goes up, assuming resistance stays the same. Conversely, if resistance goes up, current goes down, assuming voltage is constant. \n\nNow, the question is asking which combination of changes to voltage and resistance will always result in an increase in current. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Increased voltage and increased resistance. So both V and R are increasing. Since current is V/R, if both numerator and denominator increase, the effect on current depends on the relative amounts of increase. For example, if voltage doubles and resistance doubles, the current would stay the same. If voltage increases more than resistance, current increases. If resistance increases more than voltage, current decreases. So this option doesn't guarantee an increase in current. Therefore, A might not be the right answer.\n\nOption B: Decreased voltage and decreased resistance. Here both V and R are decreasing. Let's see: current is V/R. If both decrease, again, it depends on the ratio. Suppose voltage is halved and resistance is halved. Then current remains the same. If voltage decreases less than resistance, then current increases. If resistance decreases less than voltage, then current decreases. So this is also not a guaranteed increase. So B might not be correct.\n\nOption C: Increased voltage and decreased resistance. So V is up, R is down. Since current is V/R, increasing the numerator and decreasing the denominator would definitely increase the current. For example, if V goes up by 10% and R goes down by 10%, the current would increase by a factor of (1.1 / 0.9) ≈ 1.22, so about 22%. No matter how much you increase V and decrease R, as long as both happen, the current has to go up. So this seems like a solid choice. Let me check with some numbers. Suppose original V is 10V and R is 5Ω, so current is 2A. If we increase voltage to 20V and decrease resistance to 2Ω, current becomes 20/2 = 10A. Definitely higher. If we increase voltage a little and decrease resistance a little, say V=15V and R=4Ω, current is 3.75A. Still higher. So this seems like it will always work. So C is a candidate.\n\nOption D: Decreased voltage and increased resistance. Both V and R are going in directions that lower the current. So current is V/R. If V decreases and R increases, current will definitely decrease. For example, original V=10V, R=5Ω, I=2A. If V=5V and R=10Ω, I=0.5A. So D definitely decreases current, so not the answer.\n\nSo between the options, only option C has both factors working together to increase current. The other options have conflicting changes that could either increase, decrease, or have no effect depending on the magnitude. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n</think>"}
