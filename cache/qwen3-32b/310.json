Both pass through the points (16, 54) and (20, 53). Also, their leading coefficients are 2 and -2 respectively. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a quadratic polynomial has the general form ax² + bx + c. Since P(x) has a leading coefficient of 2, it would be 2x² + bx + c. Similarly, Q(x) has a leading coefficient of -2, so it would be -2x² + dx + e. The problem is asking for P(0) + Q(0). Since P(0) is just the constant term c of P(x), and Q(0) is the constant term e of Q(x), so I need to find c + e.\n\nSo, my goal is to find the constants c and e for each polynomial. To do that, I need to use the information that both polynomials pass through (16, 54) and (20, 53). That gives me equations for each polynomial.\n\nStarting with P(x):\n\nFor P(16) = 54:\n2*(16)² + b*(16) + c = 54\n\nFor P(20) = 53:\n2*(20)² + b*(20) + c = 53\n\nSimilarly, for Q(x):\n\nFor Q(16) = 54:\n-2*(16)² + d*(16) + e = 54\n\nFor Q(20) = 53:\n-2*(20)² + d*(20) + e = 53\n\nSo, if I can solve for b and c in P(x), and d and e in Q(x), then I can add c and e together.\n\nLet me first work on P(x). Let me compute 2*(16)² and 2*(20)².\n\nCalculating 16²: 256, so 2*256 = 512. Similarly, 20² is 400, so 2*400 = 800.\n\nTherefore, the equations for P(x) become:\n\n512 + 16b + c = 54 ...(1)\n\n800 + 20b + c = 53 ...(2)\n\nSimilarly for Q(x):\n\nFirst calculate -2*(16)² and -2*(20)².\n\nAgain, 16² is 256, so -2*256 = -512. 20² is 400, so -2*400 = -800.\n\nTherefore, equations for Q(x):\n\n-512 + 16d + e = 54 ...(3)\n\n-800 + 20d + e = 53 ...(4)\n\nNow, let me solve equations (1) and (2) for b and c. Similarly, equations (3) and (4) for d and e.\n\nStarting with equations (1) and (2):\n\nEquation (1): 16b + c = 54 - 512 = -458\n\nEquation (2): 20b + c = 53 - 800 = -747\n\nSo, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(20b + c) - (16b + c) = -747 - (-458)\n\nWhich simplifies to 4b = -747 + 458 = -289\n\nTherefore, b = -289 / 4. Let me compute that. 289 divided by 4 is 72.25, so b = -72.25. Alternatively, as a fraction, -289/4.\n\nThen, substitute b back into equation (1):\n\n16*(-289/4) + c = -458\n\nSimplify 16*( -289 /4 ) = 4*(-289) = -1156\n\nTherefore, -1156 + c = -458 => c = -458 + 1156 = 698.\n\nSo c = 698.\n\nNow, moving on to Q(x). Let's solve equations (3) and (4):\n\nEquation (3): 16d + e = 54 + 512 = 566\n\nEquation (4): 20d + e = 53 + 800 = 853\n\nSubtract equation (3) from equation (4):\n\n(20d + e) - (16d + e) = 853 - 566\n\nWhich simplifies to 4d = 287 => d = 287 / 4 = 71.75 or as a fraction, 287/4.\n\nThen substitute back into equation (3):\n\n16*(287/4) + e = 566\n\nSimplify 16*(287/4) = 4*287 = 1148\n\nTherefore, 1148 + e = 566 => e = 566 - 1148 = -582.\n\nTherefore, e = -582.\n\nTherefore, P(0) + Q(0) = c + e = 698 + (-582) = 698 - 582. Let me compute that.\n\n698 - 500 is 198, then subtract 82 more: 198 - 82 = 116. So 116?\n\nWait, let me check that again. 698 - 582:\n\nStart with 698 - 500 = 198\n\nThen subtract 82 more: 198 - 80 - 2 = 118 - 2 = 116. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I do arithmetic in my head, I make mistakes.\n\nFirst, for P(x):\n\nEquation (1): 16b + c = -458\n\nEquation (2): 20b + c = -747\n\nSubtracting gives 4b = -747 + 458. Let me compute 747 - 458 first:\n\n747 - 400 = 347, then -58 more: 347 - 58 = 289. So 4b = -289 => b = -289/4. Correct.\n\nThen 16b is 16*(-289/4) = 4*(-289) = -1156. Then -1156 + c = -458 => c = -458 + 1156. Let's compute 1156 - 458:\n\n1156 - 400 = 756\n\n756 - 58 = 698. Correct. So c = 698.\n\nFor Q(x):\n\nEquation (3): 16d + e = 566\n\nEquation (4): 20d + e = 853\n\nSubtracting gives 4d = 853 - 566. Let me compute 853 - 566:\n\n853 - 500 = 353, then subtract 66 more: 353 - 66 = 287. So 4d = 287 => d = 287/4. Correct.\n\nThen 16d is 16*(287/4) = 4*287. Let me compute 4*287:\n\nWell, 287*4: 200*4=800, 80*4=320, 7*4=28. So 800+320=1120 +28=1148. Correct. Then 1148 + e = 566 => e = 566 - 1148. Let me compute 1148 - 566:\n\n1148 - 500 = 648\n\n648 - 66 = 582. Therefore, e = -582. Correct.\n\nTherefore, c + e = 698 - 582 = 116. So P(0) + Q(0) is 116.\n\nWait, but let me check once again. Maybe there's a trick here? Because sometimes problems can have shortcuts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem?\n\nLet me think. Since both quadratics pass through the same two points, but have different leading coefficients. Maybe we can consider their difference?\n\nLet me consider R(x) = P(x) + Q(x). Then R(x) is a quadratic polynomial with leading coefficient 2 + (-2) = 0. Therefore, R(x) is a linear polynomial. So R(x) is linear. Since P and Q both pass through (16, 54) and (20, 53), then R(16) = P(16) + Q(16) = 54 + 54 = 108? Wait, no. Wait, P(16) = 54 and Q(16) = 54? Wait, no, the problem says that the graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points (16, 54) and (20, 53). Therefore, P(16) = 54 and Q(16) = 54, same for (20, 53). Therefore, R(16) = P(16) + Q(16) = 54 + 54 = 108, and R(20) = 53 + 53 = 106. Therefore, R(x) is a linear function passing through (16, 108) and (20, 106). Then R(x) can be found, and since R(0) = P(0) + Q(0), which is exactly what we need. Therefore, if we find R(0), that's the answer. That seems like a better approach. Let me try this.\n\nSo, R(x) is linear: R(x) = mx + n. Then R(16) = 16m + n = 108, and R(20) = 20m + n = 106. Let me solve for m and n.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: 4m = 106 - 108 = -2 => m = -2 / 4 = -1/2.\n\nThen plug back into first equation: 16*(-1/2) + n = 108 => -8 + n = 108 => n = 108 + 8 = 116. Therefore, R(0) = n = 116. Therefore, P(0) + Q(0) = 116. Which matches the previous result. So that's a much more straightforward way. So the answer is 116. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 116. Therefore, probably correct.\n\nBut let me check my previous calculations again, just to make sure I didn't make any errors. Because in the first method, I found c = 698 and e = -582. Let me check P(0) + Q(0) = 698 + (-582) = 116. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another point. For example, if I can compute R(x) as -1/2 x + 116, then R(0) is 116. Let me check R(16): -1/2 * 16 + 116 = -8 + 116 = 108. Which is 54 + 54, correct. R(20): -1/2 * 20 + 116 = -10 + 116 = 106. Which is 53 + 53, correct. So that works. Therefore, answer is 116. So maybe the first method was correct, but the second method is more efficient.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if my values for P(x) and Q(x) actually work.\n\nFor P(x): 2x² + bx + c, with b = -289/4 and c = 698. Let me check P(16):\n\n2*(16)^2 + (-289/4)*16 + 698.\n\nCompute 2*(256) = 512.\n\n(-289/4)*16 = -289*4 = -1156.\n\nTherefore, 512 - 1156 + 698 = (512 + 698) - 1156 = 1210 - 1156 = 54. Correct. Similarly, P(20):\n\n2*(20)^2 + (-289/4)*20 + 698.\n\n2*400 = 800.\n\n(-289/4)*20 = -289*5 = -1445.\n\nTherefore, 800 - 1445 + 698 = (800 + 698) - 1445 = 1498 - 1445 = 53. Correct. So that works.\n\nFor Q(x): -2x² + dx + e, with d = 287/4 and e = -582. Let me check Q(16):\n\n-2*(16)^2 + (287/4)*16 + (-582).\n\nCompute -2*256 = -512.\n\n(287/4)*16 = 287*4 = 1148.\n\nTherefore, -512 + 1148 - 582 = (1148 - 512) - 582 = 636 - 582 = 54. Correct.\n\nQ(20):\n\n-2*(20)^2 + (287/4)*20 + (-582).\n\n-2*400 = -800.\n\n(287/4)*20 = 287*5 = 1435.\n\nTherefore, -800 + 1435 - 582 = (1435 - 800) - 582 = 635 - 582 = 53. Correct. So that works as well.\n\nTherefore, all the values check out. Therefore, P(0) + Q(0) is indeed 698 + (-582) = 116, and through the R(x) method as well, 116. Therefore, answer is 116. Therefore, I can be confident that 116 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to recap the second method, which is smarter:\n\nSince both quadratics pass through the same two points, their sum is a linear function (because the quadratic terms cancel out). Then, knowing two points on that linear function allows us to determine the entire function, and thus evaluate it at 0. Since R(0) = P(0) + Q(0), which is exactly what we need. This method is much cleaner and avoids solving for all the coefficients. Definitely a better approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 116. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in my calculations. All checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{116}\n</think>"}
