Let me start by recalling the formulas for the volumes of these shapes. \n\nFirst, the volume of a cylinder. I think the formula is π times radius squared times height. So, for the beaker, which is a cylinder, the volume would be π * r² * h. The problem says the beaker is 8 cm high with a radius of 3 cm. Let me write that down:\n\nVolume of beaker (V_beaker) = π * (3 cm)² * 8 cm. Let me calculate that. 3 squared is 9, so 9 times 8 is 72. So, V_beaker = 72π cm³. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. The radius of the tank is 6 cm. Let me write that:\n\nVolume of tank (V_tank) = (4/3) * π * (6 cm)³. Let me compute that. First, 6 cubed is 6*6*6. 6*6 is 36, then 36*6 is 216. So, V_tank = (4/3) * π * 216 cm³. Let me compute 4/3 of 216. Dividing 216 by 3 gives 72, and multiplying by 4 gives 288. So, V_tank = 288π cm³.\n\nNow, to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I need to divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. So, number of beakers (N) = V_tank / V_beaker. Plugging in the numbers:\n\nN = 288π / 72π. Oh, the π cancels out, which makes sense because both volumes have π. Then, 288 divided by 72 is... let me do that division. 72 times 4 is 288. So, 288 / 72 = 4. So, N = 4. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, it would take 4 beakers to fill the spherical tank. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the cylinder volume: radius 3 cm, height 8 cm. πr²h = π*9*8 = 72π cm³. That's correct.\n\nSphere volume: radius 6 cm. (4/3)πr³. 6³ is 216, times 4/3 is 288π cm³. Correct.\n\nDivide 288π by 72π, get 4. Yep. So, 4 beakers. Hmm. Let me think if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, is there any chance that the beaker's volume is supposed to be calculated differently? Maybe if the beaker isn't completely full? But the problem says \"such beakers of water,\" so I assume each beaker is filled to the top, meaning their full volume is used. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's some consideration about the shape or something else? But no, when you fill a tank with water from beakers, it's just about the volume. So unless there's some practical issue like spilling or something, but mathematically, we just consider the volumes. \n\nAnother check: Let's compute numerical values without π. If I actually compute the volumes with π, but since π cancels, it's not necessary. But just to confirm:\n\nV_beaker = π * 9 * 8 = 72π ≈ 72 * 3.14 ≈ 226.08 cm³.\n\nV_tank = 288π ≈ 288 * 3.14 ≈ 904.32 cm³.\n\nDividing 904.32 / 226.08 ≈ 4. So, yes, exactly 4. That checks out numerically as well. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 4. It will take 4 beakers to fill the spherical tank. \n\n**Final Answer**\nIt will take \\boxed{4} beakers of water to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>"}
