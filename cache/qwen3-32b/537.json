It also accounts for the distributed mass of the rod, unlike a simple pendulum of the same length and mass.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the average of the square of the displacement of the pendulum's end, given that it's a homogeneous rod of mass M and length L, pivoted at the top, and weakly coupled to a heat reservoir at temperature T. The displacement x is much smaller than L. Alright, let me start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, since it's a pendulum made of a homogeneous rod, I remember that for small angles, the motion should be approximately simple harmonic. The problem mentions that x << L, so we can use the small angle approximation. But since it's coupled to a heat reservoir, this is probably a statistical mechanics problem where thermal fluctuations are considered. So maybe I need to use the equipartition theorem or something related to thermal energy?\n\nLet me recall: In thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy for each degree of freedom is (1/2)k_B T. But pendulums have potential energy as well. For a simple harmonic oscillator, the average potential energy is also (1/2)k_B T, so total energy would be k_B T. But here, it's not a simple pendulum; it's a physical pendulum, specifically a rod pivoted at one end.\n\nFirst, let me think about the physical pendulum. The period of a physical pendulum is given by T = 2π√(I/(mgh)), where I is the moment of inertia about the pivot, m is the mass, g is gravity, and h is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass. For a rod of length L pivoted at one end, the center of mass is at L/2, and the moment of inertia is (1/3)ML². So substituting those in, the period would be 2π√[( (1/3)ML² ) / (Mg(L/2))] ) = 2π√( ( (1/3)L² ) / ( (g L)/2 )) ) = 2π√( (2L)/(3g) ). But maybe I don't need the period directly here.\n\nBut the question is about the average displacement squared. Since the pendulum is in contact with a heat reservoir, it's undergoing Brownian motion, small thermal fluctuations around the equilibrium position. So maybe I need to model this as a harmonic oscillator and find the mean square displacement using equipartition?\n\nBut for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the average potential energy is (1/2)k_B T, so then ⟨x²⟩ = k_B T / k. However, here the pendulum's potential energy isn't exactly (1/2)k x², but for small angles, we can approximate it as such.\n\nLet me try to model the potential energy of the pendulum. When the pendulum is displaced by a small angle θ from the vertical, the center of mass is raised by a height of approximately (L/2)(1 - cosθ). For small angles, cosθ ≈ 1 - θ²/2, so the height difference is approximately (L/2)(θ²/2) = L θ² /4. Therefore, the potential energy relative to the lowest point is U = M g h = M g (L θ² /4) = (1/4) M g L θ².\n\nBut the displacement x of the end of the rod is related to θ. Since x ≈ L θ (for small θ), θ ≈ x / L. Therefore, substituting into U, we get U ≈ (1/4) M g L (x² / L²) ) = (1/4) M g x² / L. Wait, so U ≈ (M g / (4 L)) x². So the effective \"spring constant\" k here is M g / (4 L). Therefore, if I use the equipartition theorem, the average potential energy would be (1/2)k_B T, so ⟨U⟩ = (1/2)k_B T = (1/2)(M g / (4 L)) ⟨x²⟩. Solving for ⟨x²⟩ gives ⟨x²⟩ = ( (1/2)k_B T ) / ( (1/2)(M g / (4 L)) ) )? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, if U = (1/2)k x², then ⟨U⟩ = (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, (1/2)k ⟨x²⟩ = (1/2)k_B T => ⟨x²⟩ = k_B T / k. In our case, U ≈ (M g / (4 L)) x². Comparing with (1/2)k x², we have (1/2)k = M g / (4 L) => k = M g / (2 L). Therefore, ⟨x²⟩ = k_B T / k = k_B T / (M g / (2 L)) ) = 2 L k_B T / (M g). Wait, but hold on, is the potential energy here correctly modeled as (1/2)k x²?\n\nLet me re-examine the potential energy. Earlier, I had:\n\nθ ≈ x / L, where x is the displacement of the end. But θ is the angular displacement. The center of mass is at L/2, so its vertical position is lowered by (L/2)(1 - cosθ) ≈ (L/2)(θ²/2) = L θ² /4. So potential energy is U = M g (L θ² /4). But θ = x / L, so U = M g L (x² / L²) /4 = (M g / (4 L)) x². Therefore, yes, U = (M g / (4 L)) x². So if we compare this with the standard harmonic oscillator potential (1/2)k x², then k = M g / (2 L). Therefore, ⟨x²⟩ = k_B T / k = 2 L k_B T / (M g). But is this correct?\n\nWait, but in the standard case, the total energy is k_B T, with half in kinetic and half in potential. But here, are we sure that equipartition applies? The pendulum is a rotating system, so maybe I need to think in terms of angular variables?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the system as a harmonic oscillator in angular displacement θ, then relate ⟨θ²⟩ to ⟨x²⟩.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's consider the potential energy as a function of θ. For small θ, U(θ) ≈ (1/2) κ θ², where κ is the \"torsional spring constant\". For the pendulum, the potential energy is U = M g h = M g (L/2)(1 - cosθ) ≈ M g (L/2)(θ²/2) = (1/4) M g L θ². Therefore, κ = d²U/dθ² evaluated at θ=0. Let's compute that. The second derivative of U with respect to θ is d²U/dθ² = (1/4) M g L * 2 = (1/2) M g L. Wait, no. Wait, U(θ) ≈ (1/4) M g L θ². Therefore, the second derivative is (1/4) M g L * 2 = (1/2) M g L. Therefore, κ = (1/2) M g L. Therefore, the equation of motion for the pendulum is I α = -κ θ, where α is angular acceleration. So I d²θ/dt² + κ θ = 0. Therefore, the angular frequency is ω = √(κ / I).\n\nBut for thermal fluctuations, using equipartition, the average energy per degree of freedom is (1/2)k_B T. However, here we have rotational motion. The energy is (1/2) I ω² + (1/2) κ θ². In thermal equilibrium, each quadratic degree of freedom has (1/2)k_B T. So the average potential energy ⟨(1/2) κ θ²⟩ = (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / κ. Since κ = (1/2) M g L, then ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / [ (1/2) M g L ] = 2 k_B T / (M g L).\n\nThen, since x ≈ L θ, ⟨x²⟩ ≈ L² ⟨θ²⟩ = L² * 2 k_B T / (M g L) ) = 2 L k_B T / (M g). Which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, ⟨x²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). But let me check again the steps because I might have confused something.\n\nWait, in the rotational case, the moment of inertia I for the rod about the pivot is (1/3) M L². But in the equipartition approach, are we considering the kinetic energy? The kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω², and the potential energy is (1/2) κ θ². So each of these terms is a quadratic degree of freedom, so each would have average energy (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, total average energy is k_B T. Therefore, ⟨(1/2) κ θ²⟩ = (1/2)k_B T => ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / κ. And since κ = (1/2) M g L, then ⟨θ²⟩ = 2 k_B T / (M g L). Then x ≈ L θ, so ⟨x²⟩ ≈ L² ⟨θ²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). So that's the result.\n\nBut let me check if this is dimensionally correct. Let's see, [k_B T] is energy, so Joules. Then ⟨x²⟩ has dimensions of length squared. Let's check 2 L k_B T / (M g): [L] is meters, [k_B T] is Joules (kg m²/s²), denominator [M g] is kg m/s². Therefore, overall: (m * kg m²/s² ) / (kg m/s² ) ) = m³ / (m) ) = m². Correct. So dimensions check out.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is using the equipartition theorem directly on the displacement. But since the potential energy is quadratic in θ, which relates to x, we can use that. So seems okay.\n\nBut let me think again: Is the equipartition theorem applicable here? The pendulum is a system in contact with a heat bath, so it's in thermal equilibrium. Assuming that the system is classical and the energy is quadratic in the coordinates and momenta, then yes, equipartition applies. However, if there are damping forces or if the system is not in equilibrium, it might not. But since it's weakly coupled to a heat reservoir, and we're looking for the average in equilibrium, equipartition should hold.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as a Brownian motion problem, where the mean square displacement is determined by the balance between the restoring torque and thermal fluctuations. But that would lead to the same result as equipartition.\n\nBut let me also think about the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia of the rod about the pivot is I = (1/3) M L². However, in the calculation of κ, the torsional spring constant, we had κ = (1/2) M g L. The angular frequency ω is sqrt(κ / I) = sqrt( [ (1/2) M g L ] / [ (1/3) M L² ] ) ) = sqrt( ( (3/2) g ) / L ) = sqrt( 3g / (2L) ). Which is the same as the earlier expression for the period. The period T is 2π / ω = 2π sqrt( 2L / (3g) ), which matches the standard formula for a physical pendulum. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation for ⟨x²⟩ seems correct. But let me check if there is another approach. Maybe using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem? But for that, I might need to know the damping coefficient, which isn't given here. Since the problem says \"weakly coupled with a heat reservoir\", perhaps implying that we can use equipartition.\n\nAlternatively, if I model the pendulum as undergoing small oscillations, then its motion is governed by the equation:\n\nI d²θ/dt² + b dθ/dt + κ θ = 0,\n\nwhere b is the damping coefficient. In the presence of thermal fluctuations, there would be a stochastic torque, but in equilibrium, the average energy is determined by temperature. However, if we are only interested in the equilibrium average, then the damping and fluctuations are balanced such that equipartition holds. Therefore, even with damping, the average potential energy is (1/2)k_B T. So the result remains the same.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is ⟨x²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). But let me check if I made any mistake in the potential energy.\n\nEarlier, I considered the potential energy of the rod when displaced by angle θ. The center of mass is at height h = (L/2)(1 - cosθ). For small θ, 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2, so h ≈ (L/2)(θ²/2) = L θ² /4. Therefore, U = M g h ≈ (M g L /4 ) θ². Therefore, if I write U ≈ (1/2) κ θ², then κ = (M g L / 4 ) * 2 = M g L / 2. Therefore, κ = (1/2) M g L. Which is what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / κ = k_B T / [ (1/2) M g L ] = 2 k_B T / (M g L). Then ⟨x²⟩ = ⟨(L θ)^2⟩ = L² ⟨θ²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). So yes.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the end of the rod as a point mass, but no, it's a homogeneous rod. But maybe if I compare with a simple pendulum? For a simple pendulum of length L and point mass M, the potential energy for small angles is U = M g L (1 - cosθ) ≈ (1/2) M g L θ². Then ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / [ (1/2) M g L ] = 2 k_B T / (M g L), so ⟨x²⟩ = L² ⟨θ²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). Wait, same result! So even though this is a physical pendulum, the result for ⟨x²⟩ of the end is same as for a simple pendulum with the same length and mass? That seems surprising, but maybe because when considering the displacement of the end, the potential energy ends up having the same form?\n\nBut for the physical pendulum, the moment of inertia is different, but in terms of potential energy, since we are looking at the displacement of the end, the potential energy ends up being similar to the simple pendulum? Wait, for the simple pendulum, the potential energy is (1/2) M g L θ², whereas for the physical pendulum, it's (1/4) M g L θ²? No, wait, earlier we had for the physical pendulum U ≈ (1/4) M g L θ²? Wait, no, no. Wait, for the physical pendulum (rod), the center of mass is at L/2, so when the rod is displaced by angle θ, the center of mass is raised by (L/2)(1 - cosθ) ≈ (L/2)(θ²/2) = L θ² /4. Therefore, U = M g * L θ² /4. Whereas for a simple pendulum of length L with mass M at the end, the potential energy is M g L (1 - cosθ) ≈ M g L θ² /2. Therefore, the potential energy for the rod is half that of the simple pendulum for the same angular displacement. Therefore, the effective spring constant κ for the rod is half that of the simple pendulum. Therefore, ⟨θ²⟩ for the rod would be twice that of the simple pendulum. But since ⟨x²⟩ for the rod is (L θ)^2, same as for the simple pendulum, then ⟨x²⟩ for the rod would be twice that of the simple pendulum? Wait, let's check:\n\nFor the simple pendulum, ⟨θ²⟩ = 2 k_B T / (M g L), so ⟨x²⟩ = L² * 2 k_B T / (M g L) ) = 2 L k_B T / (M g). For the rod, ⟨θ²⟩ = 2 k_B T / (M g L) as well? Wait, no. Wait, for the rod, κ = (1/2) M g L. Therefore, ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / κ = k_B T / [ (1/2) M g L ] = 2 k_B T / (M g L). Therefore, same ⟨θ²⟩ as the simple pendulum? But the potential energy is different. How come?\n\nBecause even though the potential energy is different, the κ is different. For the simple pendulum, κ is d²U/dθ² = M g L. For the rod, κ is (1/2) M g L. Therefore, ⟨θ²⟩ is inversely proportional to κ, so for the rod it's twice as much as for the simple pendulum? Wait, no, if κ is half, then ⟨θ²⟩ is double. Therefore, for the rod, ⟨θ²⟩ is double that of the simple pendulum. However, since x = L θ, ⟨x²⟩ is also double. But for the simple pendulum, ⟨x²⟩ would be 2 L k_B T / (M g). For the rod, ⟨x²⟩ is also 2 L k_B T / (M g). Wait, same result? How?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nFor the simple pendulum:\n\nU = (1/2) κ_simple θ² = (1/2) M g L θ². Therefore, κ_simple = M g L. ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / κ_simple = k_B T / (M g L). Therefore, ⟨x²⟩ = L² ⟨θ²⟩ = L² * k_B T / (M g L) ) = L k_B T / (M g).\n\nFor the rod:\n\nU = (1/2) κ_rod θ² = (1/2)*(1/2 M g L) θ² = (1/4) M g L θ². Therefore, κ_rod = (1/2) M g L. Then ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / κ_rod = 2 k_B T / (M g L). Then ⟨x²⟩ = L² * 2 k_B T / (M g L) ) = 2 L k_B T / (M g). So indeed, the ⟨x²⟩ for the rod is twice that of the simple pendulum. Which makes sense because the rod has a lower κ, leading to larger fluctuations in θ, but since x is proportional to θ, ⟨x²⟩ ends up being larger. So in this case, the answer is ⟨x²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's use the equipartition theorem considering the rotational kinetic energy. The total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. For the rod, the kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω², where I = (1/3) M L², and ω is the angular velocity. The potential energy is (1/2) κ θ², with κ = (1/2) M g L. In thermal equilibrium, each quadratic degree of freedom has (1/2)k_B T. There are two quadratic terms here: kinetic energy and potential energy. Therefore, the average kinetic energy is (1/2)k_B T and the average potential energy is (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, ⟨(1/2) I ω²⟩ = (1/2)k_B T and ⟨(1/2) κ θ²⟩ = (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, ⟨θ²⟩ = k_B T / κ = 2 k_B T / (M g L), same as before. Therefore, ⟨x²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). So this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of the center of mass displacement, but the problem asks for the displacement of the pendulum's end. So if I had considered the displacement of the center of mass, it would be half of x, but since we need the end, we stick with x = L θ.\n\nAnother check: Let's consider units again. ⟨x²⟩ has units of m². Let's check 2 L k_B T / (M g):\n\nk_B has units J/K. T is in K, so k_B T is J. Then numerator: L * J = m * N m = m² * kg / s². Denominator: M g has units kg * m / s². Therefore, overall units: (m² * kg / s² ) / (kg m / s² ) = m². Correct. So units are good.\n\nAnother sanity check: If gravity increases, the displacement decreases, which makes sense. If temperature increases, displacement increases. If mass increases, displacement decreases. All makes sense.\n\nBut let me think if there is another factor I might have missed. For example, is the moment of inertia playing any role here? In the equipartition approach, we considered the potential energy, but what about the kinetic energy? The kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω². Since I is (1/3) M L², but in the equipartition, we said that ⟨(1/2) I ω²⟩ = (1/2)k_B T. However, does this affect ⟨x²⟩? No, because ⟨x²⟩ comes from the potential energy side. But let me check if the relation between potential and kinetic energy is correct.\n\nIn a harmonic oscillator, the average kinetic energy equals the average potential energy, both being (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, even though the kinetic energy depends on the moment of inertia, the average is still (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, regardless of I, as long as the system is a harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium, the average potential energy is (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, the calculation of ⟨θ²⟩ from the potential energy is valid.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. So ⟨x²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). Therefore, the average of the square of the displacement of the pendulum's end is (2 L k_B T)/(M g).\n\nBut let me check literature or similar problems. For example, the mean square displacement of a pendulum in thermal equilibrium. I recall that for a simple pendulum, ⟨x²⟩ = k_B T / (M g / L), which would be L k_B T / (M g). Wait, but earlier I found for the simple pendulum ⟨x²⟩ = L k_B T / (M g), and for the rod it's twice that. Which seems to match with our previous conclusion. So if the question had been about a simple pendulum, the answer would be different. But since it's a physical pendulum (rod), the answer is twice that. So this seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think is that the effective mass at the end? But no, because it's a distributed mass. However, the potential energy ends up being equivalent to having half the mass at the center. But in terms of the displacement of the end, it's still connected to the angular displacement.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of the effective spring constant. If we want to model the end of the rod's motion as a linear harmonic oscillator, what would be the effective spring constant? The potential energy is U = (1/4) M g L θ², and since x = L θ, θ = x / L. Therefore, U = (1/4) M g L (x² / L²) ) = (M g / (4 L)) x². Therefore, the effective spring constant k_eff is M g / (4 L). Then, using ⟨x²⟩ = k_B T / k_eff = 4 L k_B T / (M g). Wait, hold on! This contradicts our previous result. Wait, what is happening here?\n\nEarlier, using angular variables, we found ⟨x²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g). But if I model it as a linear oscillator with U = (1/2) k x², then here U = (M g / (4 L)) x² = (1/2)(M g / (2 L)) x², so k_eff = M g / (2 L). Therefore, ⟨x²⟩ = k_B T / k_eff = 2 L k_B T / (M g). Ah! There we go. So here, if you write U = (1/2) k x², then k is M g / (2 L), so ⟨x²⟩ is k_B T / k = 2 L k_B T / (M g). Which matches the previous result. Earlier, when I mistakenly thought of U = (M g / (4 L)) x² as (1/2) k x², I had k = M g / (2 L). Therefore, no contradiction. So that was my confusion earlier when I thought there was a discrepancy. So this confirms the result again.\n\nTherefore, I think I can be confident that ⟨x²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g).\n\nBut let me check once more with dimensional analysis and known limits. Suppose L increases, then ⟨x²⟩ increases linearly, which makes sense because the displacement is at the end. If M increases, ⟨x²⟩ decreases, which is intuitive. If g decreases (say, on the moon), ⟨x²⟩ increases, which is also intuitive. Temperature increasing leads to larger fluctuations. All good.\n\nIs there any chance I missed a factor due to the moment of inertia? For example, if I had considered the kinetic energy, would that affect ⟨x²⟩? Let's see. The kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω². The angular velocity ω is dθ/dt. If we relate this to the linear velocity of the end, v = L dθ/dt. Therefore, the kinetic energy can also be written as (1/2) I (dθ/dt)^2 = (1/2)(1/3 M L²)(dθ/dt)^2. On the other hand, the kinetic energy of a point mass at the end would be (1/2) M L² (dθ/dt)^2. Therefore, the actual kinetic energy is 1/3 of that. However, in the equipartition theorem, each quadratic degree of freedom has (1/2)k_B T. Here, the kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω², which is a quadratic term, so it should have (1/2)k_B T. Similarly, the potential energy is (1/2) κ θ², which is another quadratic term, also (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, regardless of the specific form of I or κ, the average potential energy is (1/2)k_B T. Therefore, the calculation of ⟨θ²⟩ from the potential energy is correct, and the moment of inertia doesn't affect that part. Therefore, even though the kinetic energy is different, it doesn't influence the ⟨θ²⟩ calculation because we're only using the potential energy side for that.\n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is solid. The average of the square of the displacement of the pendulum's end is ⟨x²⟩ = 2 L k_B T / (M g).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average of the square of the displacement of the pendulum's end is \\boxed{\\dfrac{2 L k_B T}{M g}}.\n</think>"}
