The object has a volume of 2 × 10^-3 m³ and a weight of 6 N. Hmm, let me recall what I know about buoyancy and floating objects.\n\nFirst, I remember that when an object floats, the buoyant force equals the weight of the object. The buoyant force is also equal to the weight of the displaced water. So, maybe I can use that to find out how much of the object is submerged and then subtract that from the total volume to find the part above?\n\nLet me write down the given information:\n\n- Volume of the object, V_total = 2 × 10^-3 m³\n- Weight of the object, W = 6 N\n- Density of water, ρ_water = 1000 kg/m³ (I think that's standard)\n- Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m/s²\n\nSo, buoyant force equals the weight of displaced water. The formula for buoyant force is:\n\nBuoyant force, F_b = ρ_water * V_submerged * g\n\nSince the object is floating, F_b = W. So:\n\nρ_water * V_submerged * g = W\n\nI can solve for V_submerged:\n\nV_submerged = W / (ρ_water * g)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nV_submerged = 6 N / (1000 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s²)\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 1000 * 9.8 is 9800. So 6 divided by 9800. Let me do that division.\n\n6 / 9800 ≈ 0.0006122 m³\n\nWait, the total volume of the object is 2 × 10^-3 m³, which is 0.002 m³. So the submerged volume is approximately 0.0006122 m³. Let me convert that into a fraction of the total volume.\n\nFraction submerged = V_submerged / V_total = 0.0006122 / 0.002\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 0.000001 to make it easier:\n\nWait, actually, 0.0006122 divided by 0.002 is the same as multiplying numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals. Wait, maybe another way. 0.0006122 is 6.122 × 10^-4, and 0.002 is 2 × 10^-3. So dividing them:\n\n(6.122 × 10^-4) / (2 × 10^-3) = (6.122 / 2) × 10^(-4 + 3) = 3.061 × 10^-1 = 0.3061\n\nSo approximately 0.3061, which is 30.61%. So that's the fraction submerged. Therefore, the fraction above water is 100% - 30.61% = 69.39%. Let me check my calculation again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, 6 divided by 9800 is 6/9800. Let me compute that again. 6 divided by 9800. Let's see, 9800 is 9.8 × 10^3. So 6 divided by 9.8 is approximately 0.6122, and then divided by 10^3 is 0.0006122 m³. Yes, that's right. Then 0.0006122 / 0.002 is indeed 0.3061, so 30.61% submerged. Therefore, 69.39% above. The answer choices are A:12%, B:30%, C:60%, D:70%. So closest is D:70%. Hmm. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the calculation correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the decimal places or the formula. Let me recheck.\n\nThe formula: V_submerged = W / (ρ_water * g). Yes, because buoyant force is ρ_water * V_submerged * g = W. So solving for V_submerged gives that. So that's correct.\n\nCalculating 6 N divided by (1000 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s²) = 6 / 9800 ≈ 0.0006122 m³. Correct. Total volume is 0.002 m³. So ratio is 0.0006122 / 0.002 = 0.3061. So 30.61% submerged. Therefore, 69.39% above. So approximately 70%, so answer D.\n\nBut let me check if there is another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the density of the object?\n\nAlternatively, the density of the object can be calculated. Since density is mass over volume. The mass of the object can be found from its weight. Weight W = m * g, so m = W / g = 6 N / 9.8 m/s² ≈ 0.6122 kg. Then density of the object, ρ_object = m / V_total = 0.6122 kg / 0.002 m³ = 306.1 kg/m³.\n\nThe density of water is 1000 kg/m³. The fraction submerged is equal to the ratio of the object's density to water's density. So fraction submerged = ρ_object / ρ_water = 306.1 / 1000 ≈ 0.3061, which is 30.61%, same as before. Therefore, the percentage above is 69.39%, so 70%. So answer D:70%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D:70%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
