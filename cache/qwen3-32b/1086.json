I have this question about three gas containers with different gases, and I need to figure out which statement is false. The containers are the same size and temperature. The gases are helium (4.0 g), nitrogen (28.0 g), and carbon dioxide (44.0 g). The options are A to D, and I need to pick the false one.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with gases, the ideal gas law is important: PV = nRT. Since all containers are the same size (same volume) and same temperature, the pressure should depend on the number of moles of gas, right? So if the number of moles is the same, then the pressure should be the same. But wait, the masses given are different. So maybe the number of moles isn't the same?\n\nLet me check that. For each gas, calculate the number of moles. \n\nHelium (He) has a molar mass of about 4.0 g/mol. So 4.0 g divided by 4.0 g/mol is 1.0 mol. \n\nNitrogen (N₂) has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol (since nitrogen is diatomic, 14*2=28). So 28.0 g divided by 28.0 g/mol is also 1.0 mol.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO₂) has a molar mass of 44.0 g/mol (12 + 16*2 = 44). So 44.0 g divided by 44.0 g/mol is 1.0 mol. \n\nOh! So all three containers have 1.0 mole of gas each. Therefore, according to PV = nRT, since V, T, and n are the same for all, the pressure P should be the same. So option C says the pressure is the same, which would be true. So C is true, not false. So maybe the false one is another option.\n\nNow looking at option B: The number of molecules in all the containers is the same. Since each has 1.0 mole, and 1 mole is Avogadro's number (6.022e23 molecules), then yes, the number of molecules is the same. So B is true. So B is not false.\n\nOption A: The densities increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide. Density is mass/volume. Since all containers have the same volume, the density is proportional to the mass. The masses given are 4.0g, 28.0g, 44.0g. So densities would be 4.0/V, 28.0/V, 44.0/V. So indeed, density order is He < N2 < CO2. So A is true. Therefore, A is not false.\n\nOption D: The average speed of all the molecules is the same. Hmm. Wait, average speed of gas molecules depends on their molar mass. The lighter the molecule, the faster the average speed at the same temperature. Since temperature is the same for all containers, the average speed is different. For example, helium is much lighter than nitrogen or CO2, so its molecules move faster. So the average speed isn't the same. Therefore, statement D is false. So D is the false statement.\n\nLet me double-check. The average kinetic energy is the same for all gases at the same temperature, but the average speed depends on molar mass. The formula for root-mean-square speed is sqrt(3RT/M), so as molar mass M increases, speed decreases. So helium (M=4) has higher average speed than nitrogen (M=28), which in turn is higher than CO2 (M=44). Therefore, D is false because the average speeds aren't the same. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
