Given angles BAC is 54 degrees and ABC is 52 degrees. Hmm, let me start by drawing a rough sketch of triangle ABC. Let me recall that in any triangle, the altitudes intersect at a point called the orthocenter, which is H here. \n\nFirst, let me note down the given angles. Angle at A, which is angle BAC, is 54°, and angle at B, angle ABC, is 52°. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, I can find the third angle at C. Let me calculate that first. \n\nSo, angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180°. Plugging in the known values: 54° + 52° + angle ACB = 180°. Adding 54 and 52 gives 106°, so angle ACB must be 180° - 106° = 74°. Okay, angle C is 74 degrees.\n\nNow, I need to find angle AHB. H is the orthocenter. I remember that in acute triangles, the orthocenter lies inside the triangle. Since all angles here are less than 90° (54°, 52°, 74°), triangle ABC is acute, so H is inside the triangle. \n\nTo find angle AHB, maybe I can use some properties related to orthocenters or cyclic quadrilaterals? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the measure of an angle formed by two altitudes relates to the original angles of the triangle. \n\nAnother approach: Let me recall that in triangle ABC, the measure of angle AHB is equal to 180° minus angle ACB. Wait, is that true? Let me verify. \n\nIn general, for the orthocenter, there are relations between the angles at H and the angles of the triangle. Let me try to recall. For example, in triangle ABC, angle AHB should be equal to 180° minus angle ACB. Let me check this. \n\nWhy would that be? Let me think. Because if we consider quadrilateral AEHD, where E and D are the feet of the altitudes from B and A respectively. Since AD and BE are altitudes, they meet at H. Then, AEHD might be cyclic? Wait, or maybe another cyclic quadrilateral? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that angles involving the orthocenter relate to the original triangle's angles through some supplementary relationships. Let me try to derive it. \n\nLet me consider triangle AHB. What are the angles in this triangle? We need to find angle at H, which is angle AHB. To find this angle, maybe I can find the other angles in triangle AHB and then use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180°. \n\nSo, if I can find angles HAB and HBA, then angle AHB = 180° - HAB - HBA. \n\nLet me think about angle HAB. Since AD is an altitude, AD is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, angle BAD is 90° minus angle ABC. Wait, let me explain. \n\nIn triangle ABC, altitude AD is perpendicular to BC, so angle ADB is 90°. Therefore, in triangle ABD, which is right-angled at D, angle BAD = 90° - angle ABD. Since angle ABD is angle ABC, which is 52°, so angle BAD = 90° - 52° = 38°. \n\nSimilarly, angle ABE is part of altitude BE. Since BE is an altitude, it is perpendicular to AC. Therefore, angle ABE is 90° minus angle BAC. Wait, let me check. In triangle ABE, right-angled at E, angle ABE = 90° - angle BAE. Since angle BAE is angle BAC, which is 54°, so angle ABE = 90° - 54° = 36°. \n\nTherefore, in triangle AHB, angle HAB is angle BAD = 38°, and angle HBA is angle ABE = 36°, so angle AHB = 180° - 38° - 36° = 180° - 74° = 106°. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought angle AHB might be 180° - angle ACB. Since angle ACB is 74°, 180° - 74° is 106°, which matches this result. So that seems to check out. Therefore, angle AHB is 106 degrees. \n\nBut let me verify this with another method to make sure. Another way to think about this is using the properties of the orthocenter. In triangle ABC, the orthocenter H creates several triangles with the vertices of ABC, and there are relationships between their angles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry? Let me try assigning coordinates to the triangle and compute the coordinates of H, then compute the angle. Although this might be more involved, but perhaps a good check. \n\nLet me try this approach. Let me place triangle ABC such that point A is at the origin, point B is along the x-axis, and point C somewhere in the plane. Let me assign coordinates. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set point A at (0, 0). Let me let AB be along the x-axis. Let me denote AB as length c, BC as a, and AC as b. However, maybe assigning specific lengths might complicate. Alternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates based on angles. \n\nAlternatively, since I know angles at A and B, maybe I can assign AB to be of length 1 for simplicity. Let me try that. Let me set point A at (0, 0), point B at (1, 0). Now, need to find coordinates of point C such that angle at A is 54°, angle at B is 52°, so angle at C is 74°, as before. \n\nTo find coordinates of point C, I can use the Law of Sines. Let me compute the lengths of sides. \n\nLaw of Sines says that a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C. Wait, here, standard notation is a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. \n\nGiven that, angle at A is 54°, angle at B is 52°, angle at C is 74°. Let me denote AB = c, BC = a, AC = b. \n\nSo, according to Law of Sines:\n\na / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C.\n\nBut if I set AB = c = 1, then:\n\na / sin 54° = 1 / sin 74°, so a = sin 54° / sin 74°, and similarly b = sin 52° / sin 74°.\n\nLet me calculate these values numerically.\n\nFirst, compute sin 54°, sin 52°, sin 74°.\n\nConverting degrees to decimals:\n\nsin 54° ≈ 0.8090\n\nsin 52° ≈ 0.7880\n\nsin 74° ≈ 0.9613\n\nTherefore,\n\na ≈ 0.8090 / 0.9613 ≈ 0.8413\n\nb ≈ 0.7880 / 0.9613 ≈ 0.8199\n\nTherefore, BC ≈ 0.8413, AC ≈ 0.8199, AB = 1.\n\nNow, coordinates of point C. Since point A is at (0, 0), point B is at (1, 0). Let me find coordinates of C.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of C as (x, y). Then, distance from A to C is b ≈ 0.8199, so:\n\nx² + y² ≈ (0.8199)² ≈ 0.6722.\n\nDistance from B to C is a ≈ 0.8413, so:\n\n(x - 1)² + y² ≈ (0.8413)² ≈ 0.7078.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 1)² + y² - x² - y² ≈ 0.7078 - 0.6722 => (x² - 2x + 1) - x² ≈ 0.0356 => -2x + 1 ≈ 0.0356 => -2x ≈ -0.9644 => x ≈ 0.4822.\n\nThen, from x ≈ 0.4822, plug back into x² + y² ≈ 0.6722:\n\n(0.4822)² + y² ≈ 0.6722 => 0.2325 + y² ≈ 0.6722 => y² ≈ 0.4397 => y ≈ sqrt(0.4397) ≈ 0.6631.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of C are approximately (0.4822, 0.6631).\n\nNow, need to find the orthocenter H. The orthocenter is the intersection of altitudes. We have altitudes AD and BE. Let me find equations for these altitudes and find their intersection.\n\nFirst, altitude AD: this is the altitude from A to BC. Since A is at (0, 0), and it goes to BC. Let me find the equation of BC to determine the slope of BC, then find the slope of altitude AD which is perpendicular to BC.\n\nCoordinates of B (1, 0) and C (0.4822, 0.6631). Let me compute the slope of BC.\n\nSlope of BC: m_BC = (0.6631 - 0) / (0.4822 - 1) = 0.6631 / (-0.5178) ≈ -1.280.\n\nTherefore, the altitude AD is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of m_BC. So slope of AD is 1 / 1.280 ≈ 0.7813. \n\nSince altitude AD passes through A (0, 0), its equation is y = 0.7813 x.\n\nNow, altitude BE: this is the altitude from B to AC. Let me find the equation of AC first, then find the slope of BE which is perpendicular to AC.\n\nCoordinates of A (0, 0) and C (0.4822, 0.6631). Slope of AC is (0.6631 - 0)/(0.4822 - 0) ≈ 0.6631 / 0.4822 ≈ 1.375. \n\nTherefore, slope of BE is the negative reciprocal: -1 / 1.375 ≈ -0.7273.\n\nAltitude BE passes through B (1, 0), so its equation is y - 0 = -0.7273(x - 1), which is y = -0.7273x + 0.7273.\n\nNow, find intersection point H of AD and BE. \n\nAD: y = 0.7813x\n\nBE: y = -0.7273x + 0.7273\n\nSet equal:\n\n0.7813x = -0.7273x + 0.7273\n\n0.7813x + 0.7273x = 0.7273\n\n(0.7813 + 0.7273)x ≈ 0.7273\n\n1.5086x ≈ 0.7273\n\nx ≈ 0.7273 / 1.5086 ≈ 0.482\n\nThen y ≈ 0.7813 * 0.482 ≈ 0.3766\n\nTherefore, coordinates of H are approximately (0.482, 0.3766)\n\nNow, need to compute angle AHB. Points A (0,0), H (0.482, 0.3766), B (1, 0). Let me compute vectors HA and HB, then find the angle between them.\n\nVector HA is A - H = (0 - 0.482, 0 - 0.3766) = (-0.482, -0.3766)\n\nVector HB is B - H = (1 - 0.482, 0 - 0.3766) = (0.518, -0.3766)\n\nThe angle between vectors HA and HB can be found using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(theta) = (HA • HB) / (|HA| |HB|)\n\nFirst compute HA • HB:\n\n(-0.482)(0.518) + (-0.3766)(-0.3766) ≈ (-0.2499) + (0.1418) ≈ -0.1081\n\nCompute |HA|:\n\nsqrt((-0.482)^2 + (-0.3766)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.2323 + 0.1418) ≈ sqrt(0.3741) ≈ 0.6116\n\nCompute |HB|:\n\nsqrt((0.518)^2 + (-0.3766)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.2683 + 0.1418) ≈ sqrt(0.4101) ≈ 0.6404\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos(theta) ≈ -0.1081 / (0.6116 * 0.6404) ≈ -0.1081 / 0.3915 ≈ -0.2761\n\nTherefore, theta ≈ arccos(-0.2761) ≈ 106 degrees. \n\nSince arccos(-0.2761) is in the second quadrant, and since cos(106°) ≈ cos(90° + 16°) = -sin(16°) ≈ -0.2756, which is very close to -0.2761. Therefore, angle AHB is approximately 106°, which matches our previous result. \n\nTherefore, this confirms that angle AHB is 106 degrees. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is using the formula for the angle between two lines. Since we have coordinates for points A, H, B, we could also compute the slopes of HA and HB and use the arctangent formula for angles between lines. But since we already did vectors and got 106°, and the first method also gave 106°, I feel confident that 106° is correct. \n\nBut just to recap the first method: \n\nWe found angle BAD = 90° - angle ABC = 90° - 52° = 38°, angle ABE = 90° - angle BAC = 90° - 54° = 36°, then in triangle AHB, angles at A and B are 38° and 36°, so angle at H is 180 - 38 - 36 = 106°. \n\nThis method is straightforward and relies on properties of altitudes and right triangles. \n\nAnother way to think about angle AHB is using the fact that in the orthocenter configuration, angle AHB is equal to 180° minus angle ACB. Since angle ACB is 74°, then 180 - 74 = 106°, which again gives the same answer. \n\nLet me try to understand why angle AHB is 180° - angle ACB. Is there a general theorem for this? \n\nYes, in fact, in any triangle, the measure of the angle formed by two altitudes (i.e., angle AHB) is equal to 180° minus the measure of the third angle (angle ACB). \n\nHere's a quick proof. Consider quadrilateral AEHD, where E and D are the feet of the altitudes from B and A. However, maybe considering cyclic quadrilaterals. \n\nAlternatively, consider that in triangle ABC, with orthocenter H. Then, angles at H relate to the original angles. Let me recall that in triangle ABC, angles involving H can be found by considering that each altitude creates right angles with the opposite side. \n\nLet me consider triangle AHB. The sum of angles in triangle AHB is 180°, so angle AHB = 180° - angle HAB - angle HBA. \n\nAs before, angle HAB is equal to 90° - angle ABC, because in triangle ABD (right-angled at D), angle BAD = 90° - angle ABD = 90° - angle ABC. Similarly, angle HBA is 90° - angle BAC. Therefore:\n\nangle AHB = 180° - (90° - angle ABC) - (90° - angle BAC) = 180° - 90° + angle ABC - 90° + angle BAC = angle BAC + angle ABC. \n\nWait, hold on! Wait, according to this, angle AHB equals angle BAC + angle ABC? But angle BAC is 54°, angle ABC is 52°, so 54 + 52 = 106°, which matches our previous result. But then angle AHB equals angle BAC + angle ABC. But angle BAC + angle ABC = 180° - angle ACB. Therefore, angle AHB = 180° - angle ACB. \n\nYes, exactly. Therefore, in general, angle AHB = 180° - angle ACB. So in this case, since angle ACB is 74°, angle AHB is 180° - 74° = 106°, which is consistent. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 106 degrees. \n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that angle AHB is 106 degrees. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe measure of angle $ \\angle AHB $ is $\\boxed{106}$ degrees.\n</think>"}
