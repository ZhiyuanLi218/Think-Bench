Structural Interpretation of the SMILES**\n\nThe SMILES string `C1CNC1C(=O)CO` can be parsed as follows:\n\n- **C1CNC1** represents a 4-membered ring with three carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom (an azetidine ring).\n- **C(=O)CO** represents a carbon atom (C) that is:\n  - Double-bonded to an oxygen atom (C=O),\n  - Single-bonded to another carbon (C),\n  - Which in turn is single-bonded to an oxygen (O) that likely has a hydrogen attached to it (OH).\n\nSo the full structure is: **Azetidine ring connected to a carbon (C) that is part of a carboxylic acid group (–C(=O)CH2OH)**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Molecular Formula Determination**\n\nBased on the structure:\n\n- **Azetidine ring** contributes:\n  - 3 carbon atoms\n  - 6 hydrogen atoms\n  - 1 nitrogen atom\n\n- **Substituent (–C(=O)CH2OH)** contributes:\n  - 2 carbon atoms\n  - 3 hydrogen atoms\n  - 2 oxygen atoms\n\nTotal molecular formula:\n- **C: 3 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 5**\n- **H: 6 (ring) + 3 (substituent) = 9**\n- **N: 1**\n- **O: 2**\n\nSo the molecular formula is **C₅H₉NO₂**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Molar Mass Calculation**\n\nUsing standard atomic weights:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 5 = **60.05 g/mol**\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 9 = **9.072 g/mol**\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol × 1 = **14.01 g/mol**\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol × 2 = **32.00 g/mol**\n\n**Total molar mass = 60.05 + 9.072 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 115.132 g/mol**\n\n---\n\n### **4.

I need to find the molar weight of the molecule with the SMILES string 'C1CNC1C(=O)CO'. Hmm, first I should probably figure out what molecule this is. Let me try to parse the SMILES.\n\nStarting from the beginning: C1CNC1... So there's a ring here. The '1' is a ring closure indicator. The first part is a six-membered ring? Wait, let me break it down. The SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nThe SMILES notation is a way to represent molecular structures as strings. The ring closures are indicated by numbers. The first 'C1' starts a ring. Then 'CN' is a carbon connected to a nitrogen. Then another 'C1' which probably closes the ring. So maybe this is a five-membered ring? Let me count the atoms between the 1s. The first C1, then C, N, C, and then the second 1. So that's four atoms between the closure points, making a five-membered ring? Wait, the first 'C1' is the first atom in the ring. Then the next atoms are C, N, C, and then the second 1 closes the ring back to the first atom. So that would be a five-membered ring with three carbons and one nitrogen. So that's a pyrrolidine ring? Or maybe a piperidine? Wait, piperidine is a six-membered ring with one nitrogen. Wait, if it's a five-membered ring with one nitrogen, that's pyrrolidine. But the SMILES here is C1CNC1... Let me count again. The first C is 1, then another C, then N, then C, then closing the ring. So that's four atoms in the ring? Wait, the first C1 is the first atom. Then the next atoms are C, N, C, and then the ring closes back to the first C. So that's four atoms in the ring? Wait, no. The ring is formed between the first C (with the 1) and the fourth C (where the 1 is again). So that would be a four-membered ring? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the ring closure.\n\nWait, in SMILES, the first occurrence of a ring closure number (like 1) marks the start of a ring, and the second occurrence of the same number marks the end. So the SMILES C1CNC1 would be a five-membered ring. Let's see: the first C is labeled 1. Then the next atoms are C, N, C, and then the ring closes back to the first C. So that's four atoms between the closure points (C, N, C, and then closing), which would make a five-membered ring. Because the first C is connected to the fourth C, making a total of five atoms in the ring. So yes, that would be a five-membered ring with three carbons and one nitrogen. So that's a pyrrolidine ring. So the molecule is a pyrrolidine derivative.\n\nThen the rest of the SMILES is C(=O)CO. So after the ring, there's a carbon connected to the ring, which has a double bond to oxygen (a carbonyl group) and a hydroxyl group (OH). Wait, the SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. Let me parse that again. The ring is C1CNC1, then connected to a carbon (C) which has a double bond to oxygen (=O) and a hydroxyl group (O). So the structure is a pyrrolidine ring connected to a carbon that has a carbonyl (C=O) and a hydroxyl (OH) group. Wait, but a carbon can't have both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl attached to it unless it's a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the structure would be a carboxylic acid. However, the SMILES is written as C(=O)CO, which is a carbon with a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. So that would be a carboxylic acid group. But wait, in SMILES, sometimes the order matters. Let me check: C(=O)CO. The central carbon is connected to the ring, then has a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. So that would be a carboxylic acid group. So the molecule is pyrrolidin-1-yl acetic acid? Or something like that.\n\nWait, but the ring is C1CNC1. Let me think. The ring is a five-membered ring with three carbons and one nitrogen. If the ring is connected to a carbon that has a carboxylic acid group, then the molecule would be 1-pyrrolidinylacetic acid. But I need to confirm the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ring is a six-membered ring. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me try again. The SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. Let's break it down:\n\n- C1: Start of the ring at carbon 1.\n- C: Next carbon.\n- N: Nitrogen.\n- C: Next carbon.\n- 1: Closing the ring back to carbon 1.\n\nSo the ring is C-N-C-C, but that's only four atoms. Wait, no. The first carbon (1) is connected to the next carbon, then nitrogen, then carbon, then back to the first carbon. So that's four atoms in the ring? Wait, no, the ring is formed between the first carbon (1) and the fourth atom, which is the carbon after the N. So that would be a four-membered ring? But four-membered rings are less common. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me visualize this. The SMILES is C1CNC1. Let's draw it as:\n\n1-C-N-C-1. So that's a four-membered ring? Wait, that would be a four-membered ring with two carbons and one nitrogen. But the SMILES is C1CNC1. Let me count again. The first carbon is labeled 1. Then the next atoms are C, N, C, and then the ring closes back to the first carbon. So that's four atoms in the ring. So the ring is C-C-N-C. So that's a four-membered ring with three carbons and one nitrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the first carbon (C1), then another carbon (C), then nitrogen (N), then another carbon (C), and then closing back to the first carbon. So that's four atoms in the ring: C, C, N, C. So three carbons and one nitrogen in a four-membered ring. That seems unusual, but possible. However, four-membered rings with heteroatoms are possible, like oxetane or azetidine. Azetidine is a four-membered ring with one nitrogen. So that would be the case here. So the ring is azetidine. Then the rest of the molecule is C(=O)CO. So the azetidine ring is connected to a carbon that has a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be azetidin-1-yl acetic acid.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. The SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. The ring is azetidine (four-membered with one N), and the substituent is a carbon connected to the ring, which has a C=O and an -OH. So that's a carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the molecule is 1-azetidinylacetic acid.\n\nNow, to calculate the molar mass, I need to count all the atoms.\n\nFirst, let's break down the molecule into its constituent atoms. Let's do that step by step.\n\nThe ring is azetidine: four-membered ring with three carbons and one nitrogen. So that's 3 C and 1 N.\n\nThen, the substituent: the ring is connected to a carbon (C) which is attached to the ring. Then this carbon is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydroxyl group (OH). Wait, but the SMILES is C(=O)CO. Let me parse that. The carbon (C) is connected to the ring, has a double bond to O (=O), and a single bond to another O (O). So that carbon has the following bonds: one to the ring (azetidine), one double bond to O, and one single bond to another O (which is OH). Therefore, the substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Wait, but the carbon is connected to the ring, then has a double bond to O and a single bond to OH. So the structure is -CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Wait, the SMILES is C(=O)CO. The central carbon is connected to the ring, has a double bond to O, and a single bond to another O. But in reality, a carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which is a carbon double bonded to O and single bonded to -OH. So that would be the case here. So the substituent is a carboxylic acid group attached to the ring.\n\nSo the molecule is azetidine connected to a CH2 group that is part of a carboxylic acid? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon that is part of the ring is connected directly to the carboxylic acid? Let me think again. The SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. So the ring is C1CNC1, and then there's a carbon (C) connected to the ring. This carbon is connected to a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. Wait, the SMILES is written as C(=O)CO. So the carbon is connected to the ring (C1CNC1), then has a double bond to O (=O) and a single bond to another O (O). So the carbon is part of a carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the structure is: the ring is connected to a carbon that has a carboxylic acid group. So the formula would be:\n\nAzetidine ring (C3H6N) + CH(COOH). Wait, no. Let's count all the atoms.\n\nFirst, the azetidine ring. Each carbon in the ring is part of the ring. Let's count all the atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe ring: C1CNC1. So there are four atoms in the ring: three carbons and one nitrogen. But wait, each carbon in the ring is bonded to other atoms. However, when calculating molar mass, we just need the total number of each atom in the entire molecule.\n\nSo the ring has three carbons and one nitrogen. Then there's the substituent: the carbon connected to the ring (let's call it C4), which is connected to the ring. Then this C4 has a double bond to O (so one oxygen in a double bond), and a single bond to another O (which is part of an -OH group). So the substituent is -C(=O)OH. Wait, but where is the hydrogen? In a carboxylic acid, the structure is -COOH, which is a carbon double bonded to O and single bonded to -OH. So that carbon is connected to two oxygens: one double bond and one single bond. Additionally, the carbon must have two more bonds. Wait, carbon has four bonds. Let me check:\n\nThe carbon in the carboxylic acid group is connected to:\n\n1. The ring (azetidine) via a single bond.\n\n2. A double bond to one oxygen.\n\n3. A single bond to another oxygen (which is part of the hydroxyl group).\n\nBut that's only three bonds. Where is the fourth bond? Wait, in a carboxylic acid, the carbon is connected to the ring, the double bond to O, and the single bond to the hydroxyl group. Wait, but that's three bonds. Wait, no. The carboxylic acid group is -COOH. The carbon is connected to two oxygens (one double bond, one single bond) and to the ring. But that's three bonds. Where's the fourth? Oh, right, the carbon is also connected to a hydrogen? No, in a carboxylic acid, the carbon is connected to the ring, the two oxygens, and there's no hydrogen on that carbon. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The carboxylic acid group is:\n\nO\n||\nC-OH\n|\nRing\n\nBut the carbon must have four bonds. The ring is one bond, the double bond to O is one (but counts as two bonds?), no, in terms of valence, each bond counts as one. Wait, carbon has four valence bonds. The carbon is connected to the ring (single bond), double bond to O (counts as two bonds), and single bond to OH (one bond). That's a total of four bonds: 1 (ring) + 2 (double bond) + 1 (OH) = 4. Yes, that works. So the carbon is connected to the ring, has a double bond to O, and a single bond to OH. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on. The total atoms in the molecule:\n\n- Carbons: Let's count all the carbons.\n\nThe azetidine ring has three carbons. Then there's the carbon connected to the ring (C4) which is part of the carboxylic acid group. Then the carboxylic acid group has another carbon? Wait, no. The carboxylic acid group is -C(=O)OH. So the carbon in the ring is connected to the carbon that is part of the carboxylic acid. Wait, no. Wait, the SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. Let me parse the connectivity again. The ring is C1CNC1, and then there's a carbon (C) connected to the ring. This carbon has a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. Wait, the SMILES is written as C(=O)CO. Let me think about the order. The carbon is connected to the ring, then has a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. But the order in SMILES is important. The SMILES is written as C(=O)CO. So the central carbon is connected to the ring (which is the previous part of the SMILES), then has a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. The O in the end is a hydroxyl group. So the total carbons in the molecule are:\n\n- 3 from the ring\n\n- 1 from the carbon attached to the ring (the one with the carboxylic acid)\n\nSo total of 4 carbons.\n\nOxygens: The carboxylic acid group has two oxygens (one double bond, one single bond to OH). So total of 2 oxygens.\n\nNitrogen: 1 from the azetidine ring.\n\nHydrogens: We'll need to account for all the hydrogens, but maybe there's a better way to calculate the molar mass by considering the molecular formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can determine the molecular formula by counting each atom.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nAzetidine ring (C3H6N) connected to a carbon that has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Wait, but the ring is azetidine, which is a four-membered ring with three carbons and one nitrogen. The formula for azetidine is C3H6N. But when it's substituted, we have to consider the substituent.\n\nWait, the ring is C1CNC1. Let me count the atoms in the ring. Each carbon in the ring is bonded to other atoms. Let's think about the ring structure. In azetidine (a four-membered ring with one N), each carbon is bonded to two other ring atoms and has substituents. Wait, maybe it's easier to draw the structure or think about the molecular formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the SMILES to determine the molecular formula.\n\nLet's parse the SMILES step by step:\n\n- C1: First carbon, start of the ring.\n\n- C: Second carbon.\n\n- N: Third atom, nitrogen.\n\n- C: Fourth carbon.\n\n- 1: Close the ring back to the first carbon.\n\nThen, connected to this ring is a carbon (C) which has a double bond to O (=O) and a single bond to O (O). So the SMILES is C(=O)CO.\n\nSo the full SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO.\n\nNow, let's count each atom:\n\nCarbons:\n\n- In the ring: 3 carbons (C1, C, C).\n\n- The carbon attached to the ring: 1 carbon.\n\n- The carbon in the carboxylic acid group? Wait, no. The carbon in the carboxylic acid is the same as the carbon attached to the ring. Wait, the carbon that is attached to the ring is the one that has the carboxylic acid group. So that's one carbon.\n\nSo total carbons: 3 (ring) + 1 (carboxylic acid carbon) = 4 carbons.\n\nNitrogens: 1 (from the ring).\n\nOxygens: 2 (from the carboxylic acid group: one in the double bond, one in the hydroxyl).\n\nHydrogens: Need to calculate based on valence.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the molecular formula and then compute the molar mass.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula.\n\nThe ring is azetidine (C3H6N). But when it's substituted, we need to consider the substituent.\n\nThe substituent is a carbon attached to the ring, which has a carboxylic acid group. So the substituent is -CH2-COOH? Or is it directly attached?\n\nWait, the SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. Let me think about the connectivity. The ring is C1CNC1, then there's a carbon (C) connected to the ring. This carbon is connected to the ring and has a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. So the structure is:\n\nRing-C(=O)OH.\n\nSo the carbon attached to the ring is directly part of the carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the substituent is -C(=O)OH. So the carbon is connected to the ring and has the carboxylic acid group.\n\nSo the molecular formula would be:\n\nRing: C3H?N. Let's figure out the hydrogens in the ring.\n\nAzetidine (a four-membered ring with one N) has the formula C3H6N. But when it's substituted, we have to consider the substituent.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count all atoms in the molecule.\n\nLet me try to count all atoms:\n\n- Carbons: 4 (3 in ring, 1 in carboxylic acid group)\n\n- Nitrogen: 1\n\n- Oxygens: 2\n\nHydrogens: Let's calculate based on valence.\n\nEach carbon has 4 bonds. Let's count the bonds for each carbon and see how many hydrogens are needed.\n\nFirst, the ring carbons. In azetidine, each carbon is part of the ring and has substituents. Let me think about the structure of azetidine. Azetidine is a four-membered ring with one nitrogen. The structure is:\n\nN\n|\nC-C\n| |\nC-C (with one C missing, since it's a four-membered ring)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about each carbon's bonds.\n\nLet's consider each carbon in the ring:\n\n1. First carbon (C1): connected to the next carbon (C2), the nitrogen (N), and the substituent carbon (the one with the carboxylic acid group). Wait, no. The ring is C1-C2-N-C3, then back to C1. Wait, the SMILES is C1CNC1. So the ring is C1-C2-N-C3, then closing back to C1. So each carbon in the ring is connected to two other ring atoms and possibly other substituents.\n\nWait, the first carbon (C1) is connected to C2 and N, and also to the substituent carbon (the one with the carboxylic acid group).\n\nThe second carbon (C2) is connected to C1 and N.\n\nThe nitrogen is connected to C2 and C3.\n\nThe third carbon (C3) is connected to N and C1.\n\nSo each carbon in the ring has two bonds within the ring and one bond to another atom (for C1, it's the substituent carbon; for C2 and C3, they have one bond within the ring and one to the nitrogen or another carbon).\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to calculate the molecular formula by considering the SMILES and the bonds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the SMILES to determine the molecular formula.\n\nThe SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO.\n\nLet me count each atom:\n\n- C: Let's count all the Cs.\n\nIn the SMILES:\n\n- The first C is C1.\n\n- Then another C.\n\n- Then N.\n\n- Then another C.\n\n- Then the ring closure 1.\n\nThen, after the ring, we have C(=O)CO.\n\nSo the carbon after the ring is C, which has a double bond to O and a single bond to O.\n\nSo total carbons:\n\nIn the ring: 3 Cs (C1, C, C).\n\nAfter the ring: 1 C.\n\nTotal: 4 Cs.\n\nNitrogens: 1 N.\n\nOxygens: 2 O (from the =O and the O in CO).\n\nHydrogens: Need to calculate based on valence.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's use the molecular formula approach.\n\nThe molecular formula is C4H?N O2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of hydrogens.\n\nEach carbon has 4 bonds. Let's calculate the total number of bonds and then use the formula:\n\nFor a molecule, the number of hydrogens can be calculated based on the valence.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula:\n\nFor a neutral molecule, the number of hydrogens can be calculated using the formula:\n\nH = 2C + 2 + N - X - (2/3)(3C - 2H - X + N - ...)\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to use the concept of valence electrons and bonds.\n\nAlternatively, since I know the molecular formula is C4HxNO2, I can calculate x.\n\nBut I need to know the structure to determine the number of hydrogens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of degrees of unsaturation.\n\nDegrees of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\n\nDoU = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, X is the number of halogens (which is 0 here), and N is the number of nitrogens.\n\nBut since I don't know H, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, since I know the structure, I can count the hydrogens.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe molecule has:\n\n- Azetidine ring (C3H?N) + substituent (C-COOH).\n\nLet's consider the azetidine ring. Azetidine itself has the formula C3H6N. But when it's substituted, we need to consider the substituent.\n\nThe substituent is a carbon attached to the ring, which has a carboxylic acid group. So the substituent is -CH2-COOH? Or is it directly attached?\n\nWait, the carbon attached to the ring is part of the carboxylic acid group. So the substituent is -C(=O)OH. So the carbon is directly attached to the ring and has the carboxylic acid group.\n\nSo the substituent is -COOH, which has the formula -CH1O2 (since a carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which is -C(=O)OH, so one carbon, two oxygens, and one hydrogen (from the -OH).\n\nBut the carbon is attached to the ring, so the substituent is -COOH. So the entire molecule's formula is:\n\nAzetidine (C3H6N) + -COOH.\n\nBut wait, the azetidine ring is substituted with a -COOH group. But when you substitute a hydrogen in azetidine with a -COOH group, you lose one hydrogen and add the -COOH group.\n\nAzetidine has the formula C3H6N. If we substitute one hydrogen with -COOH, the formula becomes C3H6N - H + COOH = C3H5N + C2H2O2 = C5H7NO2. Wait, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Azetidine has the formula C3H6N. If we attach a -COOH group to it, we replace one hydrogen with the -COOH group. So the formula becomes:\n\nC3H6N - H + COOH = C3H5N + C2H2O2 = C3 + C2 = C5, H5 + H2 = H7, N1, O2. So C5H7NO2.\n\nBut earlier, I counted 4 carbons in the molecule. Where is the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because the substituent is -COOH, which is one carbon (the C in COOH). So the total carbons would be 3 (from azetidine) + 1 (from COOH) = 4 carbons. But according to the formula above, it's C5H7NO2. That suggests I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the -COOH group is -C(=O)OH, which is one carbon, two oxygens, and one hydrogen (from the -OH). So if the azetidine is substituted with this group, the total formula would be:\n\nAzetidine (C3H6N) - H + (C1O2H1) = C3H5N + C1O2H1 = C4H6NO2.\n\nWait, but that would give us 4 carbons, 6 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 2 oxygens.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think about the actual structure.\n\nThe azetidine ring has three carbons and one nitrogen in a four-membered ring. Each carbon in the ring is bonded to two other ring atoms and possibly other substituents.\n\nThe carbon that is attached to the ring (let's call it C4) is bonded to the ring and has the carboxylic acid group. So C4 is bonded to the ring, a double bond to O, and a single bond to OH. That's three bonds for C4. Where is the fourth bond? It must be a hydrogen? No, because the carbon is already bonded to the ring, the double bond to O, and the single bond to OH. That's three bonds. Wait, but carbon needs four bonds. So there must be another bond. Is there a hydrogen on that carbon?\n\nNo, because in a carboxylic acid, the carbon is bonded to the ring, the double bond to O, and the single bond to OH. That's three bonds, so there must be a fourth bond. Where is it? Ah, the carbon is also bonded to a hydrogen? No, that would make it -CH(=O)OH, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Let me think about the actual structure of a carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which is:\n\nO\n||\nC-OH\n|\nRing\n\nBut the carbon is bonded to the ring, the double bond to O, and the single bond to OH. That's three bonds. Where is the fourth? It must be a single bond to another atom. Wait, no. Maybe the carbon is bonded to the ring and has the carboxylic acid group. Let me think about the bonding.\n\nThe carbon in the carboxylic acid group is bonded to:\n\n1. The ring (single bond).\n\n2. A double bond to one oxygen.\n\n3. A single bond to another oxygen (in the hydroxyl group).\n\nThat's three bonds. Where is the fourth? It must be a single bond to a hydrogen. So the carbon has a hydrogen attached. So the structure is -CH(=O)OH. Wait, but that would be a hydroxymethyl group with a carbonyl, which is not a carboxylic acid. A carboxylic acid has the structure -COOH, which is a carbon double bonded to O and single bonded to -OH. So the carbon is bonded to the ring, the double bond to O, and the single bond to -OH. Where is the fourth bond? It must be a single bond to a hydrogen. So the carbon has a hydrogen attached. Therefore, the substituent is -CH(=O)OH, which is a hydroxymethyl group with a carbonyl. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again. In a carboxylic acid, the carbon is bonded to two oxygens (one double bond, one single bond) and to the ring. That's three bonds. The fourth bond must be to a hydrogen. So the carbon has a hydrogen attached. So the structure is -CH(=O)OH. But that would be a hydroxymethyl group with a carbonyl, which is not a standard group. I'm getting confused here.\n\nMaybe I should use the SMILES to determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms directly.\n\nThe SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO.\n\nLet's count each atom:\n\n- C: Let's count all the Cs in the SMILES.\n\nThe SMILES has: C1, C, N, C, 1, C(=O)CO.\n\nSo the ring has 3 Cs (C1, C, C). Then there's the C in C(=O)CO. So total of 4 Cs.\n\n- N: 1 N in the ring.\n\n- O: 2 Os in the C(=O)CO part.\n\nSo the molecular formula is C4HxNO2.\n\nNow, to find x, the number of hydrogens, we need to determine the valence.\n\nEach carbon has 4 bonds. Let's calculate the total number of bonds and then determine the number of hydrogens.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe molecule has:\n\n- 4 carbons\n\n- 1 nitrogen\n\n- 2 oxygens\n\nTotal atoms: 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 atoms.\n\nBut we need to calculate the bonds.\n\nLet's start with the ring: C1CNC1.\n\nThis is a four-membered ring with three carbons and one nitrogen. Let's assume the ring has the following bonds:\n\n- Each carbon is bonded to two other ring atoms.\n\n- The nitrogen is bonded to two ring atoms.\n\nSo for the ring:\n\n- Carbon 1 is bonded to carbon 2 and nitrogen.\n\n- Carbon 2 is bonded to carbon 1 and nitrogen.\n\n- Nitrogen is bonded to carbon 2 and carbon 3.\n\n- Carbon 3 is bonded to nitrogen and carbon 1.\n\nSo the ring has four bonds (each bond is counted once).\n\nNow, the substituent is C(=O)CO. Let's parse this part.\n\nThe carbon (let's call it C4) is bonded to the ring (carbon 1), has a double bond to O (let's call it O1), and a single bond to another O (O2). So for C4:\n\n- One bond to the ring (C1).\n\n- One double bond to O1.\n\n- One single bond to O2.\n\nThat's three bonds for C4. Where is the fourth bond? It must be a bond to a hydrogen. So C4 is bonded to a hydrogen. So C4 has one hydrogen.\n\nNow, for O1 (double bonded to C4), it has a double bond to C4 and is bonded to nothing else (since it's a carbonyl group).\n\nFor O2 (single bonded to C4), it is bonded to C4 and has a single bond to a hydrogen (since it's a hydroxyl group). So O2 has one bond to C4 and one bond to H.\n\nSo the substituent has:\n\n- C4 with one hydrogen.\n\n- O1 with no hydrogens (double bonded).\n\n- O2 with one hydrogen.\n\nNow, let's calculate all the bonds and then determine the number of hydrogens.\n\nFirst, the ring bonds:\n\n- Carbon 1 is bonded to carbon 2, nitrogen, and C4 (the substituent carbon).\n\n- Carbon 2 is bonded to carbon 1 and nitrogen.\n\n- Nitrogen is bonded to carbon 2 and carbon 3.\n\n- Carbon 3 is bonded to nitrogen and carbon 1.\n\n- Carbon 4 (substituent) is bonded to carbon 1, double bonded to O1, single bonded to O2, and has one hydrogen.\n\nNow, let's count the bonds for each atom:\n\nCarbon 1 (C1):\n\n- Bonds to C2 (1), N (1), C4 (1), and has bonds to other atoms?\n\nWait, carbon has four bonds. C1 is bonded to C2, N, and C4. That's three bonds. Where is the fourth bond? It must be a bond to a hydrogen. So C1 has one hydrogen.\n\nCarbon 2 (C2):\n\n- Bonds to C1 (1), N (1), and needs two more bonds. Since it's in a ring, it's bonded to two ring atoms (C1 and N), and what else? It must have two more bonds. Wait, carbon has four bonds. C2 is bonded to C1 and N, and what else? It must have two more bonds. But in the ring, it's only bonded to C1 and N. Where are the other bonds? It must have two more bonds, which could be to hydrogens. So C2 has two hydrogens.\n\nCarbon 3 (C3):\n\n- Bonds to N (1) and C1 (1), needs two more bonds. So it has two hydrogens.\n\nCarbon 4 (C4):\n\n- Bonds to C1 (1), double bond to O1 (counts as one bond but has two electrons), single bond to O2 (1), and one hydrogen. Total bonds: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Wait, but the double bond is one bond (but it has two bonds in terms of valence). Wait, for the purpose of counting bonds, each single bond is one, double bond is one, triple bond is one. So C4 has four bonds: one to C1, one double bond to O1, one single bond to O2, and one single bond to a hydrogen. So that's four bonds.\n\nOxygen 1 (O1):\n\n- Double bond to C4 (one bond), no other bonds. So it has one bond.\n\nOxygen 2 (O2):\n\n- Single bond to C4 (one bond), single bond to a hydrogen (one bond). Total two bonds.\n\nNitrogen (N):\n\n- Bonds to C1 (1), C2 (1), and C3 (1). That's three bonds. Nitrogen has five valence electrons, so it needs one more bond or a lone pair. In azetidine, the nitrogen has a lone pair, so it's bonded to three atoms. So no additional bonds.\n\nNow, let's count all the hydrogens:\n\n- C1 has one hydrogen.\n\n- C2 has two hydrogens.\n\n- C3 has two hydrogens.\n\n- C4 has one hydrogen.\n\n- O2 has one hydrogen (from the hydroxyl group).\n\nTotal hydrogens: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo the molecular formula is C4H7NO2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the molar mass.\n\nCarbon (C): 4 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 48.04 g/mol\n\nHydrogen (H): 7 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 7.056 g/mol\n\nNitrogen (N): 1 atom × 14.01 g/mol = 14.01 g/mol\n\nOxygen (O): 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n\nAdding these up:\n\n48.04 + 7.056 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 101.106 g/mol\n\nWait, but none of the given options (A:145.200, B:115.130, C:169.250, D:144.210) match this. What did I do wrong?\n\nHmm, this suggests that my molecular formula is incorrect. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, I calculated the molecular formula as C4H7NO2 with a molar mass of about 101 g/mol, but the options are much higher. Clearly, I made a mistake in determining the molecular formula.\n\nLet me go back and re-examine the SMILES.\n\nThe SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe ring is C1CNC1, which is a four-membered ring with three carbons and one nitrogen. Then there's a carbon (C) connected to the ring, which has a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. So the substituent is C(=O)CO. Let me parse this part again.\n\nThe substituent is C(=O)CO. This is a carbon (C) that has a double bond to O (=O) and a single bond to another O (O). The O at the end is a hydroxyl group (OH). So the substituent is -C(=O)OH.\n\nBut wait, the SMILES is written as C(=O)CO. Let me think about the order. The carbon is connected to the ring, then has a double bond to O and a single bond to another O. The O at the end is part of the hydroxyl group. So the substituent is -C(=O)OH.\n\nBut in terms of atoms, this substituent has:\n\n- One carbon (C)\n\n- Two oxygens (O)\n\n- One hydrogen (from the OH)\n\nSo the substituent adds C1O2H1.\n\nNow, the ring is C3H?N. Let's determine the hydrogens in the ring.\n\nLet's consider the azetidine ring. Azetidine has the formula C3H6N. But when it's substituted, we need to consider the substituent.\n\nIf the azetidine ring is substituted with a -C(=O)OH group, we replace one hydrogen with the substituent.\n\nSo the formula becomes C3H6N - H + C1O2H1 = C4H6N + O2H1 = C4H7NO2. Wait, that's what I had before. But the molar mass calculation gives about 101 g/mol, which doesn't match any of the options. Clearly, I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the molecular formula. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me use the SMILES to determine the molecular formula by counting all atoms.\n\nThe SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO.\n\nLet's list all the atoms explicitly:\n\n- C1: carbon\n\n- C: carbon\n\n- N: nitrogen\n\n- C: carbon\n\n- 1: ring closure, not an atom\n\n- C: carbon\n\n- (=O): oxygen (double bond)\n\n- C: carbon\n\n- O: oxygen\n\nSo total atoms:\n\n- Carbon: 4 (from C1, C, C, C)\n\n- Nitrogen: 1\n\n- Oxygen: 2 (from (=O) and O)\n\nWait, but the last O is part of the hydroxyl group, so it's one oxygen. The (=O) is another oxygen. Total of 2 oxygens.\n\nBut wait, the SMILES is C(=O)CO. Let me parse this part again. The carbon is connected to the ring, has a double bond to O (=O), and a single bond to another O (O). So that's two oxygens.\n\nSo the molecular formula is C4HxNO2.\n\nNow, to find x, let's calculate the number of hydrogens.\n\nLet me use the degree of unsaturation formula.\n\nDegrees of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\n\nDoU = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, X is the number of halogens (0 here), N is the number of nitrogens.\n\nBut I don't know H, so let's rearrange the formula to solve for H.\n\nDoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nBut I need to know DoU. DoU is the number of rings + number of double bonds + number of triple bonds (each triple bond counts as 2).\n\nIn this molecule, we have:\n\n- One four-membered ring (azetidine): 1 ring.\n\n- One double bond (from the carbonyl group): 1 double bond.\n\n- No triple bonds.\n\nSo DoU = 1 (ring) + 1 (double bond) = 2.\n\nNow, using the formula:\n\n2 = 4 - (H/2) + (1/2) + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 = 4 - H/2 + 0.5 + 1\n\n2 = 5.5 - H/2\n\nRearranging:\n\nH/2 = 5.5 - 2 = 3.5\n\nH = 7\n\nSo the number of hydrogens is 7. So the molecular formula is C4H7NO2, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, calculating the molar mass:\n\nC: 4 × 12.01 = 48.04\n\nH: 7 × 1.008 = 7.056\n\nN: 1 × 14.01 = 14.01\n\nO: 2 × 16.00 = 32.00\n\nTotal: 48.04 + 7.056 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 101.106 g/mol\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the given options (A:145.200, B:115.130, C:169.250, D:144.210). This suggests that my molecular formula is incorrect. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me re-examine the SMILES. Perhaps I miscounted the number of carbons.\n\nThe SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO.\n\nLet me count the number of carbons again:\n\n- C1: 1st carbon\n\n- C: 2nd carbon\n\n- N: nitrogen\n\n- C: 3rd carbon\n\n- 1: ring closure\n\n- C: 4th carbon\n\n- (=O): oxygen\n\n- C: 5th carbon?\n\nWait, no. The SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe part after the ring is C(=O)CO. Let's break it down:\n\n- C: a carbon\n\n- (=O): this carbon has a double bond to an oxygen\n\n- CO: this carbon is also bonded to another carbon and oxygen? Wait, the SMILES is C(=O)CO. The part after the ring is C(=O)CO. Let me think about the order.\n\nThe carbon (C) is connected to the ring, has a double bond to O, and is also connected to another O. But the SMILES is written as C(=O)CO. The last part is CO, which is a carbon and an oxygen. Wait, but where is the bond?\n\nWait, the SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO. Let me parse it as:\n\n- The ring is C1CNC1.\n\n- Then, there's a carbon (C) connected to the ring.\n\n- This carbon has a double bond to O (=O) and a single bond to another carbon (C), which is connected to an oxygen (O).\n\nWait, that would change the structure. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO.\n\nAfter the ring (C1CNC1), the next part is C(=O)CO. Let's break it down:\n\n- C(=O)CO: this is a carbon (C) that has a double bond to O (=O) and is connected to another carbon (C), which is connected to an oxygen (O).\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nRing-C(=O)-C-O\n\nSo the carbon attached to the ring has a double bond to O and is connected to another carbon (C), which is connected to an oxygen (O). So the substituent is -C(=O)-CH2-OH? No, because the last O is not part of a hydroxyl group unless there's a hydrogen.\n\nWait, the SMILES is C(=O)CO. Let me think about it as a carbon (C) with a double bond to O (=O) and a single bond to another carbon (C), which is connected to an oxygen (O). But where is the hydrogen?\n\nThe SMILES is written as C(=O)CO. Let me parse it as:\n\n- The central carbon is connected to the ring, has a double bond to O, and a single bond to another carbon (C), which is connected to an oxygen (O). But the SMILES ends with O, which is a single bond to O. So the last O is a single bond to the previous carbon. But where is the hydrogen?\n\nThis suggests that the substituent is -C(=O)-CH2-OH, but the SMILES is written as C(=O)CO, which would be -C(=O)-C-O. But without a hydrogen on the last O, it would be a carboxylate ion, but the SMILES doesn't indicate a negative charge. So perhaps the last O is part of a hydroxyl group, implying a hydrogen.\n\nWait, in SMILES, the order of atoms is important. The SMILES C(=O)CO would mean that the carbon has a double bond to O and a single bond to another carbon, which is connected to an oxygen. But the oxygen at the end would need a hydrogen to be a hydroxyl group. So the structure is:\n\nRing-C(=O)-C-OH\n\nSo the carbon attached to the ring is connected to the ring, has a double bond to O, and is connected to another carbon (C), which is connected to an -OH group. So the substituent is -C(=O)-CH2-OH. But wait, that would be a carboxylic acid group? No, that would be a carboxylic acid group if it's -C(=O)OH, but here it's -C(=O)-CH2-OH, which is a hydroxyacetic acid derivative.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If the SMILES is C(=O)CO, it would mean:\n\n- A carbon (C) with a double bond to O (=O) and a single bond to another carbon (C), which is connected to an oxygen (O). But where is the hydrogen on the last O?\n\nThe SMILES doesn't explicitly show the hydrogen, but in a hydroxyl group, it would be there. So the structure is -C(=O)-CH2-OH.\n\nSo the substituent is -C(=O)CH2OH. Wait, but that would add more atoms. Let me count again.\n\nIf the substituent is -C(=O)CH2OH, then it has:\n\n- One carbon (C) with the double bond to O.\n\n- One carbon (CH2) connected to it.\n\n- One oxygen (OH) on the CH2.\n\nSo that would add:\n\n- 2 carbons (C and CH2)\n\n- 3 oxygens (from =O and OH)\n\nWait, no. Let's count:\n\n- C(=O) is one carbon and one oxygen.\n\n- CH2 is one carbon and two hydrogens.\n\n- OH is one oxygen and one hydrogen.\n\nSo total:\n\n- Carbons: 2 (C and CH2)\n\n- Oxygens: 2 (from =O and OH)\n\n- Hydrogens: 2 (from CH2) + 1 (from OH) = 3\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me try to determine the molecular formula again with this new understanding.\n\nIf the substituent is -C(=O)-CH2-OH, then the entire molecule is:\n\nAzetidine ring (C3H6N) + -C(=O)-CH2-OH.\n\nSo the molecular formula would be:\n\nC3H6N + C2H3O2 = C5H9NO2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the molar mass:\n\nC: 5 × 12.01 = 60.05\n\nH: 9 × 1.008 = 9.072\n\nN: 14.01\n\nO: 2 × 16.00 = 32.00\n\nTotal: 60.05 + 9.072 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 115.132 g/mol\n\nThis matches option B:115.130.\n\nAh! So my initial mistake was misinterpreting the SMILES. I thought the substituent was -C(=O)OH, but it's actually -C(=O)CH2OH. Let me confirm this by re-parsing the SMILES.\n\nThe SMILES is C1CNC1C(=O)CO.\n\nAfter the ring (C1CNC1), the part is C(=O)CO. Let's break it down:\n\n- C(=O)CO: This is a carbon (C) with a double bond to O (=O) and a single bond to another carbon (C), which is connected to an oxygen (O). So the structure is:\n\nRing-C(=O)-C-O\n\nBut the O at the end needs a hydrogen to be a hydroxyl group, making it -OH. So the structure is -C(=O)-CH2-OH.\n\nTherefore, the substituent is -C(=O)CH2OH, which adds two carbons, three oxygens, and three hydrogens.\n\nWait, let me count the atoms again for the entire molecule:\n\n- Azetidine ring: C3H6N\n\n- Substituent: -C(=O)CH2OH\n\nThis substituent has:\n\n- 2 carbons (C and CH2)\n\n- 3 oxygens (one from =O, one from OH, and one from the CH2? No, wait: -C(=O)CH2OH has one carbon with a double bond to O, one carbon (CH2), and an OH group. So:\n\n- Carbons: 2 (C and CH2)\n\n- Oxygens: 2 (from =O and OH)\n\n- Hydrogens: 2 (from CH2) + 1 (from OH) = 3\n\nSo the total molecular formula is:\n\nC3H6N + C2H3O2 = C5H9NO2.\n\nNow, calculating the molar mass:\n\nC: 5 × 12.01 = 60.05 g/mol\n\nH: 9 × 1.008 = 9.072 g/mol\n\nN: 14.01 g/mol\n\nO: 2 × 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol\n\nTotal: 60.05 + 9.072 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 115.132 g/mol, which is approximately 115.130 g/mol, matching option B.\n\nSo the correct answer is B:115.130.\n</think>"}
