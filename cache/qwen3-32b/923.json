Let me start by working through each step of the reaction to determine what each product is.\n\nFirst, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a cage-like structure with three equivalent carbon atoms at the 1, 3, and 5 positions of a cube. The bromines are on positions 1 and 3. When this is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, that's a high-temperature condition, which might lead to elimination reactions. Since there are two bromines, maybe a double elimination?\n\nAdamantane is highly symmetric, so the positions of the substituents will affect the product. Let me recall that in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three other carbons. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent, so maybe an E2 elimination could form a double bond between them. But with two bromines, maybe two eliminations? However, adamantane is a tricyclic molecule, so forming a double bond would create a cyclopropane-like strain? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, adamantane is a tetrahedral structure, with each face being a six-membered ring. The 1 and 3 positions are on the same face? Maybe adjacent? Let me sketch a mental picture. If I have a cube, the 1, 3, and 5 positions are each on opposite corners. Wait, perhaps the 1 and 3 positions are two adjacent carbons? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, in the adamantane structure, each carbon is connected to three others. The positions are such that 1 is connected to 2, 4, and 8. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elimination of HBr would lead to the formation of a double bond. Since the starting material is dibrominated, maybe two eliminations occur, leading to two double bonds? But that might not be possible due to the structure. Alternatively, maybe one elimination leads to a single double bond.\n\nBut considering the product's 1H NMR: the spectrum has a peak at 4.79 (2H), then 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl stretch. Wait, but how does a carbonyl come into play here? The starting material is dibromoadamantane, and elimination would give alkenes. So maybe the product is an aldehyde or ketone?\n\nWait, but how? Unless there's a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the KOH in high temperature causes some kind of oxidation or other reaction. Wait, but KOH is a base, so elimination is more likely. However, the IR suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the product isn't just an alkene. Perhaps there's a different reaction pathway.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a cyclopropanone derivative? Cyclopropanone has a carbonyl group in a three-membered ring. But how would that form from adamantane?\n\nWait, maybe the elimination is followed by some kind of ring expansion or rearrangement? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 is more indicative of a carbonyl than an epoxide. Epoxides typically have C-O stretches around 820-860 cm-1.\n\nWait, so the product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe during the reaction, the dibromoadamantane is first dehydrobrominated to form a diene, and then perhaps some kind of Diels-Alder reaction? But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a strained ring with a carbonyl.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is not an elimination but a substitution? But with two bromines and a strong base, elimination is more likely. Let me think again.\n\nIf we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and we eliminate two HBr molecules, perhaps forming a 1,3-diene. But adamantane is a rigid structure. Let me consider the structure. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent? If they are adjacent, eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the two eliminations form a conjugated diene?\n\nBut then why would the product have a carbonyl? Maybe there's another step. Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but some kind of oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless under high temperature, maybe some oxidation occurs. But that's less likely.\n\nWait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. How can that form from adamantane? Let me think of possible reactions that can introduce a carbonyl. Maybe a Grignard reaction? No, the starting material is dibrominated. Alternatively, maybe a nucleophilic substitution leading to a carbonyl? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the product is an aldehyde or ketone. If adamantane has a carbonyl group, maybe it's a derivative like adamantane-1-carboxaldehyde or something. But how would that form from dibromoadamantane with KOH?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bromines are replaced by hydroxyl groups, forming a diol, which is then oxidized. But again, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a oxidation? But the problem states that product 1 is formed directly from the dibromoadamantane with KOH. So perhaps there's a different mechanism.\n\nWait, another thought: in some cases, elimination with a strong base can lead to formation of a carbonyl if there's a possibility of a carbocation intermediate. For example, maybe the bromide is eliminated, forming a carbocation which then undergoes some kind of rearrangement leading to a carbonyl.\n\nBut how? Let me think. If a carbocation forms, perhaps a hydride shift could lead to a more stable carbocation, but how does that lead to a carbonyl? Maybe if the carbocation is attacked by a base, but that would give an alkene. Alternatively, maybe there's a rearrangement to form a cyclic ether with a carbonyl? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the product is an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But again, how would that happen from the starting material.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then under the high temperature and basic conditions, the alkene is oxidized to a carbonyl. But oxidation would require an oxidizing agent, which isn't present here. Unless the base itself can oxidize under certain conditions. Not sure.\n\nWait, let me check the NMR data again. Product 1 has a 4.79 ppm peak (2H), which is a pretty high deshielding, typical for protons adjacent to an electronegative atom or a carbonyl. For example, protons on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl usually show up around 2.0-2.5 ppm, but 4.79 is higher. Maybe it's an alpha-hydrogen to a carbonyl in a strained ring? Or maybe it's a hydroxyl proton? But hydroxyl protons are usually around 1-5 ppm depending on solvent and structure, but they usually exchange with D2O. The problem says to exclude those that exchange with deuterated solvent, so maybe the 4.79 is not a hydroxyl.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. No. So that's not it. Wait, maybe it's a proton on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl in a strained ring, leading to a higher chemical shift. For example, in cyclopropanone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl might be deshielded.\n\nWait, cyclopropanone has a carbonyl group in a three-membered ring. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be in a very strained environment, leading to high deshielding. Let me check approximate chemical shifts for such protons. I think cyclopropanone has protons around 4.5-5 ppm. So maybe the 4.79 ppm is such a proton. If product 1 is cyclopropanone, but how?\n\nWait, but cyclopropanone is a small molecule. How would it come from adamantane? Let me think. Adamantane is a cage structure. If you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and you eliminate two HBr molecules, perhaps forming a three-membered ring with a double bond? No, elimination would form a double bond. Wait, maybe a [2+2] cycloaddition? But under elimination conditions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring. Wait, if you eliminate two HBr molecules from adjacent positions, you could form a cyclopropane. But how?\n\nWait, in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, if the bromines are on adjacent carbons, then eliminating HBr from each could lead to a cyclopropane. But adamantane's structure is such that the 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent? Let me try to visualize. In the adamantane structure, each carbon is connected to three others. The positions 1 and 3 are connected through a bridge? Maybe they are two carbons apart, so eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between them? But in a rigid structure, maybe that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a bicyclic system with a carbonyl. Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe product 1 has an IR at 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl), and the 1H NMR has a 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Let me count the total protons. The 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. Adamantane has 10 protons (each of the 10 equivalent protons in the structure). Wait, no. Wait, the parent adamantane has a molecular formula of C10H16. Each of the 10 carbons is equivalent? No, the structure has different types of protons. Wait, in adamantane, there are three types of protons: the bridgehead protons (each equivalent), and others. But maybe in the product, the symmetry is different.\n\nBut the product has 14H. Let me think about the starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The molecular formula of adamantane is C10H16. Adding two Br atoms would make it C10H14Br2. After reaction with KOH, which is a strong base, if two HBr molecules are eliminated, we would lose two H and two Br, so the formula becomes C10H14Br2 - 2HBr → C10H12. But product 1 has 14H? Wait, no. Wait, the product has 14H. Let me check again.\n\nThe 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). Total protons: 2 + 10 + 2 = 14H. So the molecular formula would be C?H14O? since there's a carbonyl. The starting material after elimination would have C10H12 (if two HBr eliminated), but product 1 has 14H. That suggests that maybe instead of elimination, there was a substitution. But with excess KOH, elimination is more likely. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nOriginal starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Molecular formula: C10H16-2H + 2Br? Wait, no. Adamantane is C10H16. Adding two Br atoms would replace two H atoms, so the formula is C10H14Br2. If two HBr are eliminated, that would remove 2H and 2Br, leading to C10H14Br2 - 2HBr → C10H12. But product 1 has 14H. Therefore, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. For example, if each Br is replaced by OH, forming a diol, which would be C10H16(OH)2. But then the molecular formula would be C10H14(OH)2? Wait, original is C10H14Br2. Replacing Br with OH would add 2(OH) - 2Br. The molecular formula would be C10H14(OH)2. The number of H would be 14 + 2 (from OH) - but wait, the original H was 14 (since adamantane is C10H16, minus 2H for Br substitution: 16-2=14). Adding two OH groups would add two H, making 14 + 2 = 16 H. But product 1 has 14H. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a substitution reaction where Br is replaced by something else. But with KOH, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Br atoms and excess base, maybe two SN2 reactions? If each Br is replaced by OH, then the formula would be C10H16(OH)2. But original was C10H14Br2. So replacing Br with OH adds H. Wait, Br is replaced by OH. The formula would be C10H14Br2 → C10H16(OH)2. Let's see: each Br is replaced by OH. Each Br is -Br, each OH is -OH. So for each substitution, we lose Br and gain OH. The number of H would increase by 1 (since OH has an H, and Br is a single substituent). So starting with C10H14Br2 (14 H), after two substitutions, adding 2 H (from OH groups), total H becomes 16. But product 1 has 14 H. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe it's not substitution. Let's go back. If product 1 has 14 H, and the starting material was C10H14Br2, then the product must have C?H14O? (since there's a carbonyl). Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula would be C10H14O (assuming one O from the carbonyl). Wait, but carbonyl is one oxygen. Let me use the formula for degree of unsaturation.\n\nFor a compound with formula C10H14O, degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here. Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl, so O is present. But the starting material had Br, but product 1 probably doesn't. So formula is C10H14O? Let's compute degree of unsaturation: (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = (22 -14)/2 = 8/2 = 4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be two double bonds, or one double bond and one ring, etc. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which is one degree of unsaturation. So remaining three degrees could be from other rings or double bonds.\n\nBut how does this fit with the NMR? The NMR has 14 H. Let me think of possible structures. If the product is cyclopropanone, which has the formula C3H4O. But that's much smaller than adamantane. Wait, but maybe the product is a derivative of adamantane with a cyclopropanone group? How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. For example, if a carbonyl group is introduced into the adamantane structure. Let's say we have a ketone group, which would add one oxygen and reduce the number of H by 2 (since a CH2 becomes a C=O). But the original starting material was C10H14Br2. If two Br are eliminated as HBr, then the formula becomes C10H12. Adding an oxygen would be C10H12O. But product 1 has 14 H. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's a hydroxyl group as well? For example, a ketone and a hydroxyl group. But the IR only shows a carbonyl peak. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester? But where would the ester come from?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think about the NMR again. The most deshielded proton is at 4.79 ppm (2H). This suggests protons adjacent to an electronegative group or in a strained environment. The next is a multiplet from 2.41-2.23 (10H), which is a large number of protons. Then another 1.94 ppm (2H). The total is 14H.\n\nAdamantane has 16 H in its parent form. If product 1 has 14 H, that's two fewer. So maybe two H have been removed, perhaps as HBr. So starting from C10H14Br2, eliminating two HBr would give C10H12, but product 1 has 14 H. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but some other process. Maybe the KOH is causing a ring expansion or something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: the reaction forms a cyclic ether with a carbonyl. For example, a lactone or something. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the product is a diene with a carbonyl? No, but the IR is specific for a carbonyl.\n\nLet me think of possible structures. If the product has a carbonyl and 14 H, maybe it's a cyclic ketone. For example, if one of the bridgehead positions in adamantane has a carbonyl group. But adamantane's structure is a tricyclic system. Adding a carbonyl would require removing two H atoms (since a CH2 becomes a C=O). So starting from C10H16, removing two H and adding O gives C10H14O. The degree of unsaturation would be (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4, as before. Which includes the carbonyl (1 degree) and three more, possibly from the existing rings.\n\nBut how would such a carbonyl form from dibromoadamantane? If the two Br are on adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination leads to a carbonyl? No, elimination would lead to a double bond. Unless there's some kind of oxidation.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but some kind of oxidation. For example, if the dibromide is oxidized to a diketone. But oxidation typically requires an oxidizing agent, not KOH. Unless under high temperature, maybe the base acts as an oxidizing agent? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bromines are replaced by hydroxyl groups, forming a diol, which is then oxidized to a diketone. But again, oxidation would require an oxidizing agent. The problem states that product 1 is formed directly from the dibromoadamantane with KOH, so maybe there's a different mechanism.\n\nWait, another thought: in some cases, elimination can lead to the formation of a carbonyl if there's a possibility of a carbocation that collapses to form a carbonyl. For example, if a carbocation forms and loses a proton to form a double bond, but if there's a possibility of forming a carbonyl via some rearrangement.\n\nBut how? Let me think. Suppose we have a carbocation adjacent to a bromide. If the bromide is eliminated, forming a carbocation, and then maybe some kind of hydride shift or other rearrangement leads to a carbonyl. For example, if the carbocation is at a position where losing another proton could form a carbonyl. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elimination forms a bicyclic compound with a strained ring that can undergo some kind of rearrangement to form a carbonyl. For example, if the elimination forms a cyclopropane ring, which then undergoes a [1,2]-H shift to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the specifics.\n\nWait, let's consider the possibility that product 1 is a cyclic ketone. For example, if one of the bridgehead positions in adamantane has a carbonyl group. Let's say the structure is 1-adamantone. The formula would be C10H14O. Let's check the NMR. In 1-adamantone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be more deshielded. The NMR data shows a 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be the protons adjacent to the carbonyl. The other protons would be in a range, and the multiplet from 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the remaining protons. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another set. But how does this fit?\n\n1-adamantone has a single carbonyl group. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be two protons (since it's a bridgehead position), which might show up at around 4.7 ppm. The other protons in the adamantane framework would be in the lower field. The multiplet from 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the remaining bridge protons and other equivalent sets. The 1.94 ppm might be another set of protons. This seems plausible.\n\nIf product 1 is 1-adamantone, then the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at high temperature leads to formation of 1-adamantone. How? Maybe through a carbocation mechanism. For example, elimination of HBr to form a carbocation, which then loses another HBr and undergoes some kind of rearrangement to form the carbonyl.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two bromines are in positions that allow for a ring contraction or expansion to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure. However, given the NMR and IR data, it's plausible that product 1 is 1-adamantone (or 3-adamantone, but given the symmetry, it would be the same).\n\nAssuming product 1 is 1-adamantone, then moving on to product 2. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong base and a catalyst for certain reactions. In the context of carbonyl compounds, heating with a base might lead to an aldol condensation or some kind of elimination. But 1-adamantone is a ketone. If it's heated with a base, maybe it undergoes a decarbonylation? Or some kind of elimination to form an alkene?\n\nWait, but 1-adamantone is a ketone in a very rigid, strained ring. Maybe under these conditions, it undergoes a retro-aldol reaction? Or perhaps some kind of ring expansion. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to elimination of CO to form an alkene. For example, if the ketone is deprotonated and then loses CO, forming an alkene. But I'm not sure if that's a known reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the aluminum isopropoxide is used in a different type of reaction. For example, in the presence of a base, maybe the ketone is deprotonated and undergoes some kind of coupling. But since there's only one ketone group, maybe it's an intramolecular reaction. However, in a rigid structure like adamantane, intramolecular reactions might not be feasible.\n\nWait, another possibility: the ketone is reduced? But aluminum isopropoxide is not a reducing agent; it's a base. So probably not reduction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is an enolization. The ketone can form an enolate, which might then undergo some kind of reaction. But with excess base and heating, perhaps elimination of CO2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ketone is converted into an enol ether or something. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, if the ketone is heated with a base, maybe it undergoes decarboxylation if there's a carboxylic acid group, but there isn't one here. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is part of a larger molecule that can lose a small molecule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ketone is involved in a [1,2]-H shift to form a different structure. For example, if the ketone is in a position where it can form a more stable ring by losing CO. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think of possible reactions of ketones with strong bases at high temperatures. One possibility is the formation of enolates, which can undergo various reactions. But without another electrophile, maybe it's an intramolecular reaction. However, in adamantane's case, it's a rigid structure, so maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the ketone is part of a ring that can undergo ring-opening under basic conditions. For example, if the ketone is in a strained ring, maybe it opens up. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ketone is involved in a Claisen condensation-like reaction, but that requires two carbonyl groups.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction forms an alkene. If the ketone is deprotonated and then loses a leaving group. But there's no leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is deprotonated and then loses CO as a leaving group, forming an alkene. For example:\n\nR2C=O → R2C- + O- → then lose CO to form R2C=CH2? But that would require specific conditions. However, in a strained ketone like 1-adamantone, maybe the loss of CO is favored.\n\nIf that's the case, then product 2 would be an alkene derived from adamantane. Let's assume that. For example, if 1-adamantone loses CO to form 1-adamantene. But I need to check if such a reaction is plausible.\n\nAssuming product 2 is an alkene, then moving on to the next step: ozonolysis. Ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide to form product 3. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it to form carbonyl groups. The product would depend on the structure of the alkene.\n\nBut first, I need to determine what product 2 is. If product 1 is 1-adamantone and it undergoes some reaction to form product 2, which is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. Let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, if product 2 is an alkene, and ozonolysis is performed, then product 3 would be the ozonolysis product. The coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3 is what we need to determine.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the structures step by step.\n\nStarting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (1-adamantone). Then product 1 heated with aluminum isopropoxide → product 2. If product 2 is an alkene formed by loss of CO from the ketone, then product 2 would be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. Let's say the double bond is between the former carbonyl carbon and an adjacent carbon. But in adamantane's structure, the carbonyl is at a bridgehead position. Removing CO would leave a double bond in a strained position.\n\nAssuming product 2 is such an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. The structure of the alkene would determine the ozonolysis product.\n\nFor example, if the double bond is between two bridgehead positions, then ozonolysis might form a carbonyl group at each end. However, given the symmetry of adamantane, the product might be a symmetric diketone or something else.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Let me try to think of the actual structures.\n\nAdamantane is a tricyclic system. The 1-adamantone would have a carbonyl group at the bridgehead. If this ketone is heated with a base and loses CO to form an alkene, the structure would have a double bond at the former carbonyl position. Ozonolysis of such a double bond would cleave it, forming two carbonyl groups. However, given the symmetry, maybe it forms a single compound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ozonolysis product is a cyclic compound. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if product 2 is a simple alkene, then ozonolysis would give carbonyl compounds. For example, if the double bond is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 would then have protons adjacent to these carbonyls.\n\nThe question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3. The options are triplet, doublet of triplets, pentet, or triplet of triplets.\n\nTo determine the coupling pattern, I need to know the structure of product 3 and the neighboring protons.\n\nLet me assume that product 2 is an alkene with a double bond in a position that, when cleaved by ozonolysis, gives a diketone or similar. For example, if the double bond is between two carbons that, when cleaved, give two carbonyl groups.\n\nBut let's think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is 1-adamantene, with a double bond between the former carbonyl position and an adjacent carbon. Ozonolysis would cleave this double bond to form a carbonyl group at each end. Given the symmetry of adamantane, this might result in a molecule with two carbonyl groups in symmetric positions.\n\nThe NMR of product 3 would then have protons adjacent to these carbonyl groups. The most deshielded protons would be those adjacent to the carbonyl groups.\n\nLet's say product 3 is a symmetric diketone. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be in a specific coupling environment.\n\nFor example, if each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, the protons on that CH2 would be coupled to the adjacent protons. Depending on the number of neighboring protons, the coupling pattern would vary.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the question gives the options, so perhaps there's a standard coupling pattern for such a scenario.\n\nLet me think again. The most deshielded proton in product 3. If product 3 is a diketone with two carbonyl groups, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be the most deshielded. Let's say each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. If the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, then the protons would be coupled to both neighboring protons. But if the structure is symmetric, maybe each CH2 is adjacent to one carbonyl and another CH2.\n\nAlternatively, if the ozonolysis product has a single carbonyl group, but that's less likely if the starting alkene was symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe product 3 is a single ketone. For example, if the ozonolysis of the double bond gives a single carbonyl group. But that would be the case if the double bond is at the end of a chain, but in a cyclic molecule, it might give two carbonyls.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let me try to think of the coupling patterns. The options are triplet, doublet of triplets, pentet, or triplet of triplets.\n\nA triplet would mean coupling to two equivalent protons. A doublet of triplets would mean coupling to two different sets of protons. A pentet would be coupling to four equivalent protons. A triplet of triplets would be coupling to two different protons with different coupling constants.\n\nIf the most deshielded proton is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then the protons would be coupled to the adjacent CH2's protons. If the CH2 is between two other CH2 groups, the coupling would be more complex.\n\nBut let's think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like:\n\nO=C-CH2-CH2-...\n\nThe protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. If each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, then the coupling would be a triplet (from the two adjacent protons). However, if there are multiple couplings, it could be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, if the proton is part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to two different sets of protons, it could give a doublet of triplets.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure, I need to make an educated guess based on the reaction steps.\n\nLet me go back. Product 1 is likely 1-adamantone. Heating with aluminum isopropoxide... Maybe it's a decarbonylation reaction to form 1-adamantene. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond to form a diketone. In that case, the diketone would have two carbonyl groups. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be the most deshielded.\n\nIn a symmetric diketone derived from adamantane, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be in a symmetric environment. For example, if each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, and each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group. The coupling pattern would depend on the number of neighboring protons.\n\nIf the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each proton would be coupled to two equivalent protons (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet. However, if there are multiple couplings from different J values, it could be a more complex pattern.\n\nBut given the symmetry of adamantane derivatives, it's possible that the coupling is simple. For example, if the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group that is adjacent to one other CH2 group, leading to a triplet. Hence, option A.\n\nAlternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to two different sets of protons, leading to a doublet of triplets. But in a symmetric molecule, the couplings might be equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, if the proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a single CH group, but that seems less likely in a symmetric structure.\n\nGiven the options, I think the most likely answer is a triplet (option A), because the most deshielded protons are likely on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, coupled to two equivalent protons from an adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet. However, I need to confirm.\n\nWait, another possibility: if the ozonolysis product has a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2 group that is part of a three-membered ring, leading to more complex coupling. For example, if the structure has protons with multiple couplings.\n\nBut without the exact structure, it's hard. Let me think about the original NMR of product 1: the 4.79 ppm (2H) likely corresponds to protons adjacent to the carbonyl. In product 3, after ozonolysis, if there are more carbonyl groups, those adjacent protons would be even more deshielded.\n\nIf product 3 has a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups, the protons would be very deshielded and might show a coupling pattern based on adjacent protons. For example, if it's a CH2 group between two carbonyls, the protons would be coupled to each other (since they're on the same CH2), leading to a singlet, but that's not an option. Or if it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2, leading to a triplet.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for standard coupling patterns in ozonolysis products.\n\nWhen ozonolysis cleaves a double bond, it typically forms carbonyl groups. For example, if the double bond is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis gives two aldehydes or ketones. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be in a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. In such a case, the protons would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 protons. For example, if the structure is R-CH2-CH2-C(=O), the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be coupled to the next CH2's protons, leading to a triplet.\n\nBut if the structure is more complex, like in a cyclic system, the coupling could be different. Given the symmetry of adamantane derivatives, it's plausible that the coupling is a triplet.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A: triplet.\n</think>"}
