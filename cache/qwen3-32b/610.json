That is, at **any point** on the surface, the electric field just outside the conductor is determined by the local surface charge density at that point.\n\n3. **Field Outside the Conductor:**\n   - The electric field outside the conductor is **not zero** unless the net charge is zero.\n   - The field is **not necessarily uniform** and does **not vary linearly** with distance from the center of mass (especially for non-spherical objects or non-uniform charge distributions).\n   - However, **near the surface**, the field can be approximated locally by the surface charge density at that point.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n- **Option A:** *The electric field outside the object is zero.*\n\n  ❌ **Incorrect.** A charged conductor produces an electric field outside of it. The field is not zero unless the net charge is zero, which is not the case here.\n\n- **Option B:** *The electric field outside the object is equal to the electric field inside the object.*\n\n  ❌ **Incorrect.** The electric field **inside** a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is **zero**, while the field **outside** is generally non-zero. Therefore, they cannot be equal.\n\n- **Option C:** *The electric field outside the object is directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object.*\n\n  ❌ **Incorrect.** This is not a general rule. The electric field outside a conductor depends on the shape and charge distribution of the object, not simply on the distance from the center of mass.\n\n- **Option D:** *The electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.*\n\n  ✅ **Correct.** This is a well-established result in electrostatics: the electric field just outside the surface of a conductor is given by:\n\n  $$\n  E = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0}\n  $$\n\n  This is **true locally** at every point on the surface, even if the charge distribution is non-uniform.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about a solid metal object with a non-uniform charge distribution on its surface. The question is asking which of the four options is correct regarding the electric field. Let me try to work through each option step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But this question is about a solid metal object that's isolated and has a non-uniform charge distribution. Wait, but even if the charge distribution is non-uniform, the charges should arrange themselves on the surface such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. That's because if there were an electric field inside, the free electrons would move until the field is canceled out. So maybe the electric field inside is zero regardless of the charge distribution? That might be important for option B.\n\nOption A says the electric field outside the object is zero. Hmm. Well, if the object has a net charge, then outside the conductor, there should be an electric field due to the charges on the surface. For example, a charged metal sphere has an electric field outside just like a point charge. Even if the charge distribution isn't uniform, the field outside might not be zero. So A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B: The electric field outside is equal to the electric field inside. But we just thought that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So if the electric field outside isn't zero (as in option A is wrong), then the field outside can't be equal to the field inside (which is zero). So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: The electric field outside is directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass. Wait, for a spherical object, the electric field outside would be proportional to 1/r² (like Coulomb's law), not directly proportional to r. But this object isn't necessarily spherical, and the charge distribution is non-uniform. So the field outside might not follow a simple relation like that. Unless it's talking about very close to the surface? But the option says \"outside the object, but very close to the surface\" isn't mentioned here. So maybe C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: The electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density divided by permittivity of free space. Hmm. I recall that for a conductor, the electric field just outside the surface is σ/ε₀, where σ is the surface charge density. Is that only true for a flat surface or for any conductor? Wait, yes, I think that's a general result. Because at the surface of a conductor, the electric field is perpendicular to the surface and has magnitude σ/ε₀. Even if the charge distribution is non-uniform, at any given point on the surface, the local electric field just outside is σ/ε₀. So even if σ varies across the surface, at each point, the field just outside that point is σ/ε₀ there. So D seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check. The formula E = σ/ε₀ is derived for a flat conductor surface, but in general, for any conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field right outside the surface is σ/ε₀. So even if the charge distribution isn't uniform, this relation holds locally. So D is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
