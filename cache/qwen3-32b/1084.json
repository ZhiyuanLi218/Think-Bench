The problem mentions expressing the answer in terms of angular momentum J. Alright, let me start by recalling what the effective potential energy is in the context of central force problems.\n\nIn classical mechanics, when dealing with central forces, the effective potential energy combines the actual potential energy and the centrifugal potential due to angular momentum. The formula for the effective potential U_eff(r) is usually given by:\n\nU_eff(r) = V(r) + (J²)/(2μr²)\n\nwhere μ is the reduced mass of the system, and J is the angular momentum. However, in this problem, they mention expressing the maximum value in terms of J, so maybe the reduced mass is not needed here? Or perhaps it cancels out? Wait, the question says \"expressed in terms of angular momentum J\", so maybe they just want the expression involving J without other constants? Hmm, but I need to check if there are other constants involved.\n\nWait, the given potential is V(r) = -c r⁻⁴. So substituting into the effective potential, we have:\n\nU_eff(r) = -c r⁻⁴ + (J²)/(2μr²)\n\nBut the problem says \"Find the maximum value of the effective potential energy expressed in terms of angular momentum J, denoted as U₀.\"\n\nBut the problem didn't mention reduced mass μ. Maybe this is a quantum mechanical problem? Or perhaps in some context where μ is considered to be 1? Or maybe the question assumes that we are to consider the effective potential in terms of J without other constants? Wait, maybe I need to check if there's a standard way to write effective potential for this kind of potential.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in a context where the centrifugal term is considered as part of the effective potential, and we need to find its maximum. So, regardless of μ, maybe the problem is expecting me to write U_eff(r) as given by combining V(r) and the centrifugal term, then find its maximum value as a function of r, and express that maximum value U₀ in terms of J (and c? Or maybe c is expressed in terms of other constants?).\n\nGiven that c is given as c = e² p_a² / 2, but since the problem says \"expressed in terms of angular momentum J\", maybe c is treated as a constant here, and we need to express U₀ in terms of J and c?\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, write the effective potential:\n\nU_eff(r) = V(r) + (J²)/(2μr²)\n\nBut the problem didn't mention μ. Maybe in this case, the problem is in a unit system where μ is 1? Or maybe it's a different convention? Wait, the original problem says \"Find the maximum value of the effective potential energy expressed in terms of angular momentum J, denoted as U₀.\"\n\nSo perhaps the problem assumes that the effective potential is only the combination of the given potential and the centrifugal term, and we need to find its maximum value. However, without knowing μ, we can't express it in terms of J unless μ is incorporated somehow. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"The interaction between an atom and an ion can be described by the potential energy V(r) = -c r^{-4}, where c = e² p_a² / 2, e is the ion charge, and p_a is the polarizability of the atom. Find the maximum value of the effective potential energy expressed in terms of angular momentum J, denoted as U₀.\"\n\nSo, they want the maximum value of the effective potential energy, which is U_eff(r) = V(r) + centrifugal term. But since they didn't mention mass or reduced mass, maybe they are considering the effective potential in a way that the centrifugal term is expressed differently? Wait, in some contexts, especially in quantum mechanics, the effective potential might be written with different factors. However, in classical mechanics, the centrifugal term is (J²)/(2μr²). \n\nBut since the problem is about an atom and an ion, which is a quantum system, but the question is phrased in terms of potential energy and angular momentum, maybe they are using the classical expression for the effective potential. However, without knowing the reduced mass μ, how can we express U₀ in terms of J? There must be some relation or assumption here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that the motion is in two dimensions or something? Or perhaps the problem is considering the effective potential in terms of energy units where mass is incorporated into J? Wait, angular momentum J has units of [mass × length² / time], so if we have terms with J²/(r²), then J²/(r²) has units [mass² × length² / time²]. Therefore, if we have U_eff(r) = -c r^{-4} + (J²)/(2μr²), then to have consistent units, c must have units of [energy × length^4]. Let me check:\n\nGiven V(r) = -c r^{-4}, so c must have units of [Energy × Length^4]. Let's confirm:\n\nEnergy has units of [Mass × Length² / Time²]. So c has units [Mass × Length² / Time² × Length^4] = [Mass × Length^6 / Time²]. Wait, no, if V(r) is -c r^{-4}, then c must be Energy × Length^4. So if Energy is [Mass × Length² / Time²], then c is [Mass × Length² / Time² × Length^4] = [Mass × Length^6 / Time²]. \n\nBut J²/(2μr²) has units of [Mass² × Length^4 / Time²] / [Mass × Length²] = [Mass × Length² / Time²], which is Energy. So that's consistent. Therefore, in the effective potential, we have two terms: one with -c r^{-4} and another with + J²/(2μ r²). Therefore, to find the maximum of U_eff(r), we need to take derivative with respect to r, set to zero, solve for r, then plug back into U_eff(r) to find U₀.\n\nBut the problem is that the answer needs to be expressed in terms of J. However, the expression will also involve c and μ. But the problem didn't mention μ. Wait, perhaps in the problem's context, μ is considered to be 1? Or maybe there is a different approach here?\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. It says \"Find the maximum value of the effective potential energy expressed in terms of angular momentum J, denoted as U₀.\" So maybe the problem assumes that we are to use the given c and J, and somehow μ is incorporated into the constants? But since c is given in terms of e and p_a, which are properties of the system, but J is another variable here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in a unit system where μ is absorbed into J? But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in my approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not considering the centrifugal term? But the question says \"effective potential energy,\" which usually includes the centrifugal term. However, maybe in this case, they define the effective potential differently? For example, in some contexts, when people talk about effective potential, they might include other terms. But given that the problem is about an atom and an ion, it's likely that the effective potential is the sum of the actual potential and the centrifugal term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the potential energy curve for the interaction, and the maximum of the effective potential is the point where the particle can be in a circular orbit? But in that case, the maximum would correspond to an unstable equilibrium. However, regardless, the process would be the same: take derivative of U_eff(r), set to zero, find r, then compute U_eff(r) at that r.\n\nBut again, without knowing μ, how can we express U₀ in terms of J? Unless there is another way. Wait, maybe the problem is in a quantum mechanical context where the angular momentum is quantized, but they still want an expression in terms of J? Or maybe there's a different approach here.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"Find the maximum value of the effective potential energy expressed in terms of angular momentum J, denoted as U₀.\" Maybe they are considering only the potential V(r) and not the centrifugal term? But that wouldn't make sense because the maximum of V(r) is just zero as r approaches infinity, but since V(r) is negative, it goes to zero from below. So the maximum of V(r) is zero. But that seems trivial. However, the effective potential includes the centrifugal term which goes to infinity as r approaches zero, so the effective potential will have a maximum somewhere between r=0 and infinity.\n\nTherefore, the effective potential U_eff(r) = -c r^{-4} + J²/(2μ r²). To find its maximum, take derivative with respect to r:\n\ndU_eff/dr = 4c r^{-5} - J²/(μ r³)\n\nSet derivative to zero:\n\n4c r^{-5} - J²/(μ r³) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by r^5:\n\n4c - J²/(μ) r² = 0\n\nSolving for r²:\n\nJ²/(μ) r² = 4c => r² = (4c μ)/J² => r = sqrt(4c μ / J²) = 2 sqrt(c μ)/J\n\nSo the radius at which the effective potential is maximum is r = 2 sqrt(c μ)/J.\n\nNow plug this back into U_eff(r):\n\nU_eff(r) = -c r^{-4} + J²/(2μ r²)\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: -c r^{-4} = -c [r^4]^{-1} = -c [ (2 sqrt(c μ)/J )^4 ]^{-1}? Wait no:\n\nWait r = 2 sqrt(c μ)/J, so r^4 = [2 sqrt(c μ)/J]^4 = 16 (c μ)^2 / J^4\n\nTherefore, first term is -c / [16 (c μ)^2 / J^4] = -c * J^4 / [16 c² μ²] = - J^4 / [16 c μ²]\n\nSecond term: J²/(2μ r²). Let's compute r²:\n\nr² = [2 sqrt(c μ)/J]^2 = 4 c μ / J²\n\nTherefore, second term is J² / [2μ * 4 c μ / J²] = J² * J² / [8 μ * c μ] = J^4 / [8 c μ²]\n\nTherefore, total U_eff(r) is:\n\n- J^4 / (16 c μ²) + J^4 / (8 c μ²) = [ -1/16 + 1/8 ] J^4 / (c μ²) = (1/16) J^4 / (c μ²)\n\nTherefore, U₀ = J^4 / (16 c μ²)\n\nBut the problem says \"expressed in terms of angular momentum J\", but here we have μ and c. However, c is given in terms of e and p_a, but the problem says \"expressed in terms of angular momentum J\", so maybe we need to write it in terms of J and c? Since c is a constant here, given by e² p_a² / 2, but unless we have more information about μ, I don't see how to eliminate μ from the expression.\n\nBut the problem didn't mention μ. Maybe there's something missing here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in a context where the reduced mass μ is 1? For example, if we are working in natural units where certain constants are set to 1? But the problem didn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach where μ is incorporated into J? For example, if angular momentum is given as J = μ r² ω or something? But no, angular momentum is J = μ r² θ˙ in classical mechanics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually referring to a quantum mechanical system where the angular momentum is quantized as J² = ħ² l(l+1), but again, without knowing the relation between ħ and other constants, I don't see how to proceed. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"expressed in terms of angular momentum J\", so perhaps they just want the expression in terms of J and c, accepting that μ is a constant? But in that case, the answer would be U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c μ²). However, since the problem didn't mention μ, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. The potential is given as V(r) = -c r^{-4}, with c = e² p_a² / 2. The question is about the effective potential energy. In some contexts, especially in scattering problems, the effective potential is considered as the centrifugal barrier plus the potential. However, maybe in this case, the problem is considering the effective potential in a way that does not involve mass? For example, in a purely classical problem where mass is considered to be incorporated into the definition of J?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in error, or maybe I need to assume that the mass is 1? But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to model the effective potential here?\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the potential energy for a rigid rotor or something similar? But no, the potential is given as -c r^{-4}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the potential energy in the context of a particle moving under the influence of V(r) and angular momentum, but without considering mass? That seems inconsistent with physics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a unit system where the mass μ is absorbed into the definition of c? For example, if c already includes μ? But according to the given c = e² p_a² / 2, there is no μ in there. Polarizability p_a has units of [Charge × Length² / Electric Field], but I need not get bogged down in units here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the effective potential in the context of energy, where the kinetic energy is not considered? But no, the effective potential is specifically the potential plus the centrifugal term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different expression for the effective potential here. Wait, in some cases, when dealing with potentials that have a specific form, you can write the effective potential differently. For example, for a gravitational or Coulomb potential, the effective potential is V(r) + l²/(2μ r²). But here, the potential is different. But I don't see how that would change the expression for the effective potential.\n\nWait, unless the problem is referring to the potential energy in a different way. For example, if the potential is already including the angular momentum dependence? But no, the potential is given as V(r) = -c r^{-4}, which is a central potential.\n\nWait, unless the problem is referring to the potential energy for a rigid rotor, but that is usually just the centrifugal term. But here, the potential is given as -c r^{-4}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion between potential energy and effective potential energy? For example, if someone refers to the effective potential energy as just the centrifugal term? But that doesn't make sense because then the maximum would be infinity as r approaches zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the total mechanical energy, which includes kinetic and potential energy? But the question specifically says \"effective potential energy\".\n\nHmm. Since the problem is from an unspecified source, perhaps I need to go back to my previous calculation and check if there's a way to express μ in terms of other quantities? For example, if we consider the system's energy or something else?\n\nWait, another approach: maybe in this problem, the motion is considered in a way that relates angular momentum J to the potential? For example, if we consider circular orbits, where the centripetal force is provided by the force from the potential. However, even then, we would need to relate J to the radius of the orbit, which would involve mass.\n\nLet me try that approach. For a circular orbit, the centripetal acceleration is provided by the force from the potential. The force is F(r) = -dV/dr. Given V(r) = -c r^{-4}, then F(r) = -d/dr (-c r^{-4}) = 4c r^{-5}. The direction is positive, meaning it's a repulsive force? Wait, if V(r) is negative and becomes less negative as r increases, then the force is positive, meaning it's repulsive? Wait, but if an ion and an atom are interacting, the potential is given as -c r^{-4}. Depending on the sign of c, but since c is e² p_a² / 2, and e² is positive (assuming e is the magnitude of the ion charge), then c is positive. Therefore, V(r) is negative, and the force is positive (repulsive?), but let's check:\n\nForce is F(r) = -dV/dr. V(r) = -c r^{-4}, so dV/dr = 4c r^{-5}, so F(r) = -4c r^{-5}. Therefore, the force is negative, meaning attractive? Because if you have a particle at position r, the force is pulling it towards the origin? Wait, if F(r) is negative, then it's towards decreasing r? So if the potential is V(r) = -c r^{-4}, then the force is F(r) = -dV/dr = - [4c r^{-5}] = -4c r^{-5}. So if c is positive, then F(r) is negative, meaning the force is attractive (towards the origin). \n\nSo for a circular orbit, we have F(r) = - (J²)/(μ r³). Wait, the centripetal force required for circular motion is F = μ v² / r, and since angular momentum J = μ r² ω, and v = ω r, so J = μ r v, so v = J/(μ r). Therefore, centripetal acceleration is v² / r = J² / (μ² r³), so force is μ v² / r = J² / (μ r³). Since the force is attractive, it should be negative, so equating:\n\nF(r) = - J² / (μ r³)\n\nBut earlier, we have F(r) = -4c r^{-5}\n\nTherefore:\n\n-4c r^{-5} = - J² / (μ r³)\n\nSimplify:\n\n4c r^{-5} = J² / (μ r³)\n\nMultiply both sides by r^5:\n\n4c = J² / (μ r²)\n\nWhich gives:\n\nr² = J² / (4c μ)\n\nTherefore, r = J / (2 sqrt(c μ))\n\nWhich is the same as before when we found the radius for maximum effective potential. Wait, so in this case, the radius for circular orbit is the same as the radius where the effective potential has its maximum? That seems contradictory because usually, the circular orbit occurs at a minimum or maximum of the effective potential. In fact, extrema of the effective potential correspond to possible circular orbits. However, whether it's a minimum or maximum depends on the potential. In this case, since we found that the effective potential has a maximum at that radius, that would correspond to an unstable circular orbit.\n\nBut regardless, this approach also leads us to the same expression for r. However, again, we still need μ to express U₀ in terms of J.\n\nBut the problem says \"Find the maximum value of the effective potential energy expressed in terms of angular momentum J, denoted as U₀.\" Given that the problem provides c in terms of e and p_a, but doesn't mention μ, maybe there is a different interpretation?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a different definition of effective potential where the centrifugal term is already incorporated into V(r)? That seems unlikely. Or perhaps the problem is in error, and they actually want the maximum of the given potential V(r), not the effective potential? But as I thought before, V(r) = -c r^{-4} approaches zero from below as r increases, so its maximum is zero. But that seems trivial and probably not what they want.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the potential energy curve for the interaction, considering some other factors? For example, in van der Waals forces, you have potentials like -C/r^6, but this is -c/r^4. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the potential energy in the context of a particle with angular momentum J moving under V(r), and the effective potential is being considered as V(r) plus something else? But in standard physics, the effective potential is V(r) plus the centrifugal term.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's phrasing. Maybe \"effective potential energy\" here refers to something else, like the potential energy adjusted for some other effect? For example, in some contexts, when you have a charged particle moving in a magnetic field, you get an effective potential, but that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the potential energy in the center-of-mass frame or something? But again, that would not change the expression for the potential.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the problem is in a one-dimensional context? But no, angular momentum is involved, which implies at least two dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the motion is purely radial, and angular momentum is zero? But then the effective potential would just be V(r), and its maximum would be zero, which again seems trivial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the potential energy of the system in terms of angular momentum, considering some other relation? For example, in the case of a rigid body, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the given potential V(r) is already the effective potential? But that seems unlikely because effective potential usually includes the centrifugal term.\n\nWait, let me check the units again. If the effective potential is U_eff(r) = -c r^{-4} + J²/(2μ r²), then the maximum value U₀ depends on J, c, and μ. Since the problem asks to express U₀ in terms of J, but doesn't mention μ or c, maybe there is a standard relation between these quantities in this specific physical system?\n\nFor example, in some cases, you can relate angular momentum to other constants via the condition for circular motion. Earlier, we found that for a circular orbit, 4c = J²/(μ r²). So if we solve for μ, we get μ = J²/(4c r²). But unless we have a specific r, we can't substitute this into the expression for U₀.\n\nBut if we use the radius at which the effective potential is maximum, which is r = 2 sqrt(c μ)/J, we can express μ in terms of r and other quantities. But again, without knowing r, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eliminate μ by using another relation? For example, if we consider the energy of the system? But the problem doesn't mention energy.\n\nWait, unless the problem is assuming that the system is at the maximum of the effective potential, which would mean that the total energy is equal to U₀, and there's no kinetic energy? But in reality, at the maximum of the effective potential, the radial kinetic energy is zero, but the tangential kinetic energy (related to angular momentum) is non-zero. However, the effective potential already includes the centrifugal term, which is part of the potential energy accounting for angular momentum. So the total mechanical energy would be the effective potential plus the radial kinetic energy. At the maximum of U_eff(r), the radial kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is equal to U₀. But without knowing the total energy, I don't see how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to leave μ in the expression, and since c is given in terms of e and p_a, and J is given, then U₀ is expressed as J⁴/(16 c μ²). But since the problem says \"expressed in terms of angular momentum J\", and c is given in terms of e and p_a, which are constants, but μ is not mentioned. Perhaps the problem assumes that μ is 1? Or maybe there is a typo and they meant to include μ in terms of other variables?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to re-express μ using the given c? But c is e² p_a² / 2, and μ is the reduced mass of the ion and the atom. Unless there is a standard expression for μ in terms of e and p_a, which I don't think there is.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in error, and they actually want the maximum of the potential V(r) = -c r^{-4} under some constraint related to angular momentum? For example, in a collision problem, the impact parameter is related to angular momentum, but I don't see how that would give a maximum of the potential.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are referring to the potential energy in the context of a rotating frame or something else?\n\nAt this point, I might need to consider that perhaps the problem assumes that the centrifugal term is the only term in the effective potential, and they want the maximum of that? But that doesn't make sense because the centrifugal term increases as r decreases, so it doesn't have a maximum—it goes to infinity as r approaches zero. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the maximum of the negative of the effective potential? No, the question specifically says \"maximum value of the effective potential energy.\"\n\nGiven that I can't seem to eliminate μ from the expression, and the problem statement does not provide information about μ, I might have to consider that perhaps the original problem assumes that the reduced mass μ is incorporated into the constant c, or that there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, let me check the expression for c again. It says c = e² p_a² / 2. The polarizability p_a usually has units of volume times charge squared or something like that? Wait, polarizability α is defined such that the induced dipole moment p = α E, where E is the electric field. The units of α would be [p]/[E] = [C·m]/[N/C] = [C²·m/N]. In SI units, electric field E has units of N/(C·m), so polarizability α has units of C²·m²/N. However, in the given expression, c = e² p_a² / 2, so let's check the units:\n\ne is charge, so e² has units [C²]. p_a is polarizability, which has units [C²·m²/N]. So p_a² has units [C^4·m^4/N²]. Therefore, e² p_a² has units [C^6·m^4/N²]. Divided by 2, still same units. But c is supposed to have units [Energy × Length^4], which is [Mass × Length^6 / Time²]. So unless there are other constants involved, these units don't match. This suggests that either there is a missing constant in the expression for c, or there's a different unit system being used.\n\nFor example, if we are in Gaussian units or another system where electric field has different units, but this might complicate things further. Given that the problem is likely intended for an introductory physics or upper-level undergraduate course, maybe there's a simplification or assumption being made here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not in SI units, and the expression for c is simplified. For example, if we consider the interaction between an ion with charge e and an atom with polarizability α (let's use α instead of p_a to avoid confusion with dipole moment p), the potential energy can be derived as follows:\n\nWhen an ion with charge e is near an atom, it induces a dipole moment in the atom. The induced dipole moment p is given by p = α E, where E is the electric field due to the ion at the position of the atom. The electric field of the ion at distance r is E = e / r² (in some unit system). Then, the potential energy of the dipole in the electric field is U = -p · E / 2, but wait, actually the potential energy of a dipole in an electric field is U = -p · E, but in this case, the dipole is induced by the field, so the total potential energy is the energy of the dipole in the external field minus the work done to polarize the atom. This is a bit more complex.\n\nActually, the standard derivation for the ion-atom interaction (also known as ion-induced dipole interaction) gives a potential energy of the form V(r) = - (α e²) / (2 r^4). Which matches the given expression V(r) = -c r^{-4} with c = α e² / 2. So in this case, c = α e² / 2. So the units would be consistent if α has units of [length³], which it does in SI units (polarizability has units of C·m²/V, which is equivalent to C²·m²/(N·C) = C·m³/N, since E = N/C). Wait, let me check:\n\nIn SI units, electric field E is N/C. Polarizability α is defined by p = α E, so α has units of p/E, which is (C·m) / (N/C) = C²·m / N. To relate this to length cubed, note that 1 C²·m / N = 1 (C²/(N·m)) × m². Since electric permittivity ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²), so α has units of ε₀ × m³. Therefore, α has units of m³ in SI units if we include ε₀. But in the expression for c, we have c = e² α / 2, which would have units of (C²) × (C²·m / N) = C⁴·m / N, which doesn't seem to match [Energy × Length^4]. Wait, maybe I need to include ε₀?\n\nActually, the correct formula for the ion-induced dipole potential is V(r) = - (α e²) / (2 ε₀ r^4) in SI units. So if the problem is using a unit system where ε₀ = 1 (like Gaussian units), then c = α e² / 2. But if not, then there's a missing ε₀. However, given that the problem provides c as e² p_a² / 2, maybe they are using a unit system where ε₀ is absorbed or set to 1.\n\nRegardless, the units issue aside, going back to the problem, since I cannot resolve the μ issue, perhaps the problem assumes that μ is incorporated into the definition of J? For example, if J is defined such that J²/(2μ) is part of the centrifugal term, but without knowing μ, I can't see how to proceed.\n\nWait, here's a thought: maybe the problem is referring to the effective potential in a quantum mechanical context, where the angular momentum is quantized, and the effective potential is being considered for a specific quantum state. However, without knowing the specific quantum numbers or the relation between J and other constants, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in error, and the potential is supposed to be V(r) = -c r^{-4} + J²/(2μ r²), and they want the maximum in terms of J and c, accepting that μ is a constant. In that case, the answer would be U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c μ²). But since the problem says \"expressed in terms of angular momentum J\", and c is given, maybe μ is supposed to be expressed in terms of c and other given quantities? But there is no information about μ in the problem statement.\n\nWait, unless there's a standard relation between μ and c in this specific interaction? For example, if we consider the system's energy or something else? But I don't see a direct relation.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck here, perhaps I should re-express my earlier result in terms of c and J, acknowledging that μ is a constant, and see if the problem expects that answer despite not mentioning μ. The problem says \"Find the maximum value of the effective potential energy expressed in terms of angular momentum J, denoted as U₀.\" If they consider that c already includes μ, or if μ is supposed to be expressed in terms of other quantities, but there's no way to do that with the given information, then maybe the answer is U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c²) ? Wait, no, in my calculation it was J⁴ / (16 c μ²). If somehow c includes μ, but there's no indication of that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in my earlier steps. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting from U_eff(r) = -c r^{-4} + J²/(2μ r²)\n\nTaking derivative:\n\ndU_eff/dr = 4c r^{-5} - J²/(μ r³)\n\nSetting to zero:\n\n4c r^{-5} = J²/(μ r³) => 4c = J² r² / μ => r² = 4c μ / J² => r = 2 sqrt(c μ)/J\n\nSubstitute back into U_eff(r):\n\nFirst term: -c / r^4 = -c / [ (2 sqrt(c μ)/J )^4 ] = -c / [ 16 (c μ)^2 / J^4 ] = -c J^4 / [16 c² μ²] = - J^4 / (16 c μ²)\n\nSecond term: J²/(2μ r²) = J² / [2μ * (4c μ / J²)] = J^4 / [8 μ² c]\n\nAdding both terms: - J^4 / (16 c μ²) + J^4 / (8 c μ²) = ( -1 + 2 ) J^4 / (16 c μ²) = J^4 / (16 c μ²)\n\nYes, that's correct. So U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c μ²). Since the problem asks to express it in terms of J, and c is given, but μ is not mentioned, I'm forced to conclude either:\n\n1. There is a typo or omission in the problem statement, and they forgot to mention μ or provide a relation to it.\n\n2. The problem assumes that μ is 1 in some unit system, making U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c).\n\n3. The problem expects the answer in terms of J and c, accepting that μ is a constant, so U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c μ²).\n\nGiven that the problem provides c as e² p_a² / 2, and asks for the answer in terms of J, I think the most plausible is that they expect the answer in terms of J and c, assuming that μ is a known constant, so the answer is U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c μ²). However, since the problem does not mention μ, it's possible that in the context where this problem is given, μ is considered to be 1, or perhaps it's a different convention where the effective potential is defined without μ. \n\nWait, in some contexts, especially in problems where the mass cancels out, or when considering dimensionless quantities, μ might be incorporated into other constants. However, without explicit information, it's risky to assume. Given that the problem is likely from a textbook or course material, and given that similar problems often assume that the reduced mass μ is incorporated into the potential constant or is otherwise known, perhaps the intended answer is U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c²). Wait, why squared? No, in our calculation it's J⁴ / (16 c μ²). If there's a missing relation, like μ = something in terms of c, but there isn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem had a different potential, like V(r) = -c r^{-n} and asked for a general solution, and in this case n=4, and there's a standard formula. For example, for a general potential V(r) = -k r^{-n}, the effective potential maximum can be found, but again, it would depend on n and the angular momentum.\n\nWait, let's try to think of it dimensionally. Suppose we want to find U₀ in terms of J and c. Let's assume that U₀ has dimensions of energy, and we need to construct an energy from J and c. Given that J has dimensions [M L² T^{-1}], and c has dimensions [Energy × L^4] = [M L² T^{-2} × L^4] = [M L^6 T^{-2}]. To get energy [M L² T^{-2}], we need to combine J and c appropriately.\n\nLet's see: Let's suppose U₀ = k * J^a * c^b, where k is dimensionless. Let's find a and b.\n\nDimensions of J^a: [M^a L^{2a} T^{-a}]\n\nDimensions of c^b: [M^b L^{6b} T^{-2b}]\n\nCombined: [M^{a + b} L^{2a + 6b} T^{-a - 2b}]\n\nThis should equal [M^1 L^2 T^{-2}]. Therefore:\n\nFor mass: a + b = 1\n\nFor length: 2a + 6b = 2\n\nFor time: -a - 2b = -2\n\nLet's solve these equations.\n\nFrom mass: a = 1 - b\n\nSubstitute into time equation:\n\n-(1 - b) - 2b = -2 => -1 + b - 2b = -2 => -1 - b = -2 => -b = -1 => b = 1\n\nThen a = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nCheck length: 2*0 + 6*1 = 6 ≠ 2. Not consistent. So this suggests that it's not possible to construct an energy solely from J and c. Therefore, there must be another constant involved, which is μ. This confirms that my earlier result is dimensionally correct, and that without μ, it's impossible to express U₀ in terms of J and c alone.\n\nGiven this, I must conclude that either the problem is missing information, or there is a different interpretation. Since the problem is given as is, and assuming that it's from a standard physics context, perhaps the intended answer is U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c μ²), and the mention of expressing in terms of J is meant to indicate that μ and c are constants, so it's expressed in terms of J along with those constants. However, since the problem says \"expressed in terms of angular momentum J\", it's possible that there is a different approach or a simplification.\n\nWait, let me go back to the original effective potential. If we assume that the problem is in a unit system where μ = 1, then U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c). This would be the case if, for example, the units are chosen such that the reduced mass is 1. If that's the case, then the answer would be U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c). Given that the problem does not mention μ, this might be the intended answer, assuming μ = 1.\n\nGiven that in many physics problems, especially in theoretical contexts, constants like mass are often set to 1 for simplicity, this might be the case here. Therefore, assuming μ = 1, the maximum value of the effective potential energy is U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c).\n\nGiven that the problem provides c in terms of e and p_a, and asks for U₀ in terms of J, this seems plausible. Therefore, I think this is the intended answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c). Substituting c = e² p_a² / 2, it would be U₀ = J⁴ / [16 * (e² p_a² / 2)] = J⁴ / (8 e² p_a²), but the problem says to express it in terms of J and c, so we leave it as U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c).\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration and checking, I think the answer is U₀ = J⁴ / (16 c).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum value of the effective potential energy is \\boxed{\\dfrac{J^4}{16c}}.\n</think>"}
