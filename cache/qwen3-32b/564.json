It is important to note that **K is only affected by changes in temperature**. Here's a breakdown of the options:\n\n- **A: The pressure of reactants**  \n  Changing the pressure of reactants or products shifts the position of equilibrium (per Le Chatelier’s principle) but does not alter the value of K. K remains constant as long as temperature is unchanged.\n\n- **B: The pressure of products**  \n  Similar to A, altering product pressure affects equilibrium position but not the value of K.\n\n- **C: The temperature**  \n  Temperature directly impacts the value of K. This is because the equilibrium constant is tied to the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction, which is temperature-dependent. For exothermic reactions, increasing temperature decreases K; for endothermic reactions, increasing temperature increases K.\n\n- **D: The total mass of the chemicals present**  \n  The amount of substance (mass or moles) does not affect K, as it is a ratio of concentrations or partial pressures. Changes in total mass proportionally affect all components, leaving the ratio (and thus K) unchanged.\n\n**Correct Answer: C: The temperature**  \nTemperature is the only factor listed that changes the numerical value of the equilibrium constant.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these options changes the numerical value of the equilibrium constant. Let me start by recalling what the equilibrium constant is. From what I remember in chemistry, the equilibrium constant, K, is a value that expresses the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants at equilibrium, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. \n\nNow, the question is asking which of the given factors will change the numerical value of K. The options are A through D, each a different factor. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: The pressure of reactants. Hmm, I think that changing the pressure of reactants or products can shift the position of the equilibrium, according to Le Chatelier's principle. For example, if you increase the pressure of reactants, the system might shift towards the products to counteract that change. But does that affect the value of K? I think not. Because K is a constant at a given temperature. Changes in concentration or pressure can shift the equilibrium but not change K itself. So maybe A isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B: The pressure of products. Similar to A, changing the pressure of products would shift the equilibrium position, but not the value of K. So B is probably also not the correct answer.\n\nOption C: The temperature. Wait, I remember that temperature is the only factor that can actually change the value of the equilibrium constant. Because K depends on the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction, which is temperature-dependent. If the reaction is exothermic or endothermic, changing the temperature will shift the equilibrium and also change the value of K. For example, increasing the temperature for an exothermic reaction will decrease K, while for an endothermic reaction, increasing temperature will increase K. So temperature definitely affects K. So C is a candidate for the correct answer.\n\nOption D: The total mass of the chemicals present. Hmm, if you have more mass, but the concentrations or partial pressures are adjusted proportionally, then the ratio (which K depends on) might stay the same. For example, if you just add more of all substances, the concentrations change, but the ratio of products to reactants remains the same, so K doesn't change. Unless the total mass affects something else... but I don't think so. K is independent of the amount of substance because it's a ratio. So D probably doesn't affect K.\n\nSo putting it all together, the only factor here that changes K is temperature. Therefore, the answer should be option C.\n</think>"}
