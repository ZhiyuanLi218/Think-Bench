Let me start by recalling how to balance redox reactions in acidic conditions. \n\nFirst, the unbalanced half-reaction is BrO3^- → Br2. Since it's a half-reaction, I need to balance the atoms and the charges by adding H2O, H+, and electrons. \n\nLet me start by balancing the bromine atoms. On the left, there's one Br in BrO3^-, and on the right, there are two Br in Br2. To balance the Br atoms, I can multiply BrO3^- by 2. So:\n\n2 BrO3^- → Br2\n\nNow, there are 2 Br atoms on both sides. Next, I need to balance the oxygen atoms. There are 6 O atoms on the left (from 2 BrO3^-), and none on the right. To balance oxygen, I add H2O to the side that needs oxygen. So, I add 6 H2O molecules to the right:\n\n2 BrO3^- → Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nNow, the oxygen is balanced (6 O on each side). Next, balance the hydrogen atoms. There are 12 H atoms on the right (from 6 H2O), so I add H+ ions to the left to balance them. Let me count: each H2O has 2 H, so 6 H2O has 12 H. Therefore, I need 12 H+ on the left:\n\n2 BrO3^- + 12 H+ → Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nNow, the hydrogens are balanced. Now, I need to balance the charges by adding electrons. Let me calculate the total charge on each side.\n\nLeft side: 2 BrO3^- has a charge of -2 (since each is -1), and 12 H+ is +12. Total charge: -2 + 12 = +10.\n\nRight side: Br2 is neutral, and 6 H2O is neutral. Total charge: 0.\n\nSo, the left side has +10 charge, and the right side is 0. To balance the charges, electrons are added to the left or right. Since oxidation is loss of electrons and reduction is gain. Here, since BrO3^- is going to Br2, which is a reduction (bromine goes from +5 oxidation state in BrO3^- to 0 in Br2), so it's a reduction, meaning electrons are gained (added to the left side).\n\nThe difference in charge is +10 on the left and 0 on the right. To balance this, we need to add electrons to the left side to reduce the positive charge. The amount of electrons needed is such that the total charge on both sides is equal.\n\nLet me denote the number of electrons as 'n'. Adding n electrons to the left side:\n\nTotal charge on left becomes +10 - n. This should equal the charge on the right, which is 0.\n\nSo:\n\n+10 - n = 0 → n = 10\n\nWait, so 10 electrons are added to the left side? But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the charges.\n\nLeft side: 2 BrO3^- is 2*(-1) = -2, and 12 H+ is +12. Total charge: -2 +12 = +10. Correct.\n\nRight side: Br2 is 0, 6 H2O is 0. Total charge 0. Correct.\n\nSo to balance the charge, we need to add electrons. Since the left side is more positive, we need to add electrons to the left side to make it less positive. So:\n\nTotal charge left: +10 - (number of electrons). Set equal to 0:\n\n+10 - e = 0 → e = +10. Wait, electrons have a charge of -1 each. So adding 10 electrons to the left side would add -10 charge. So total left charge becomes +10 -10 = 0. Correct. So the balanced half-reaction is:\n\n2 BrO3^- + 12 H+ + 10 e^- → Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nTherefore, there are 10 electrons on the left side. But the options given are A:6 left, B:6 right, C:3 left, D:10 left. So D would be the answer. But wait, let me check the oxidation states again to confirm.\n\nIn BrO3^-, the oxidation state of Br is +5. In Br2, it's 0. So each Br atom gains 5 electrons. Since there are 2 Br atoms in BrO3^- (but wait, no, the 2 BrO3^- gives 1 Br2 molecule with 2 Br atoms). So total change per Br atom: from +5 to 0, which is a gain of 5 electrons. For two Br atoms in BrO3^- (each +5) going to 2 Br atoms in Br2 (each 0), total electrons gained is 2*(5) = 10 electrons. Therefore, since it's reduction, electrons are on the left side. So yes, 10 electrons on the left. Therefore, the answer is D:10 electrons on the left.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the stoichiometry is correct. Let me write the balanced equation again:\n\n2 BrO3^- + 12 H+ + 10 e^- → Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nCheck the atoms:\n\nBr: 2 on left, 2 on right. Good.\n\nO: 6 on left (from 2 BrO3^-), 6 on right (from 6 H2O). Good.\n\nH: 12 H+ on left, 12 H in 6 H2O (6*2=12). Good.\n\nCharge: Left side: 2*(-1) + 12*(+1) + 10*(-1) = -2 +12 -10 = 0. Right side: 0. Charge balanced. Correct.\n\nYes, so the balanced half-reaction has 10 electrons on the left. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
