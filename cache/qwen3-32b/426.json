Hmm, arithmetic sequences... let me recall. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. So, if the first term is, let's say, 'a' and the common difference is 'd', then the nth term can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = a + (n - 1)d\n\nRight? So, for example, the fourth term would be a + 3d, the fifth term is a + 4d, and so on. The problem says the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500. So, maybe I can set up two equations with these pieces of information and solve for 'a' and 'd', and then use that to find the sixth term?\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nFourth term: a + 3d = 200\n\nEighth term: a + 7d = 500\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1) a + 3d = 200\n\n2) a + 7d = 500\n\nIf I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, I can eliminate 'a' and solve for 'd'. Let me try that.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\n\nSimplify left side:\n\na + 7d - a - 3d = 4d\n\nRight side: 300\n\nSo, 4d = 300 => d = 300 / 4 = 75\n\nOh, so the common difference is 75. That seems pretty big, but let's check if that makes sense.\n\nIf d = 75, then we can plug back into equation 1 to find 'a'.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + 3*75 = 200 => a + 225 = 200 => a = 200 - 225 = -25\n\nSo, the first term is -25 and the common difference is 75. Let me verify if the eighth term is indeed 500.\n\nEighth term is a + 7d = -25 + 7*75 = -25 + 525 = 500. Yes, that checks out. Good.\n\nNow, the question asks for the sixth term. Let's compute that. The sixth term is a + 5d.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na + 5d = -25 + 5*75 = -25 + 375 = 350.\n\nWait, so the sixth term is 350? Let me cross-verify this another way. Since the fourth term is 200, and each term increases by 75, the fifth term should be 200 + 75 = 275, sixth term is 275 + 75 = 350, seventh term 350 + 75 = 425, eighth term 425 + 75 = 500. Yep, that matches the given eighth term. So, the sixth term is indeed 350.\n\nAlternatively, since the arithmetic sequence is linear, maybe there's another way to think about it without solving for 'a' and 'd'. For instance, the fourth term to the eighth term is 4 terms apart. The difference between the eighth term and the fourth term is 500 - 200 = 300. Since there are 4 terms from the fourth to the eighth, the common difference would be 300 divided by 4, which is 75, same as before. Then, the sixth term is two terms after the fourth term. So, starting from the fourth term (200), adding 2*d would be 2*75 = 150, so 200 + 150 = 350. Same answer. So, that's another way to think about it.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the sixth term is 350.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's go through the steps again quickly.\n\nGiven:\n\nTerm 4: a + 3d = 200\n\nTerm 8: a + 7d = 500\n\nSubtracting gives 4d = 300 => d = 75. Then a = 200 - 3*75 = 200 - 225 = -25. Term 6: a + 5d = -25 + 375 = 350. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, difference between term 8 and term 4 is 4d = 300, so d=75. Term 6 is term 4 + 2d = 200 + 150 = 350. Correct.\n\nSeems solid. Therefore, the sixth term is 350.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sixth term is \\boxed{350}.\n</think>"}
