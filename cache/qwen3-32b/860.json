Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with different bases, it's sometimes easier to convert the numbers to base 10, perform the division there, and then convert the result back to base 5. Let me try that method first. \n\nFirst, let me convert 413 base 5 to decimal. In base 5, each digit represents a power of 5. The rightmost digit is 5^0 (which is 1), then 5^1 (which is 5), then 5^2 (which is 25), and so on. \n\nSo, for 413 base 5:\n- The rightmost digit is 3, which is 3 * 5^0 = 3 * 1 = 3\n- The middle digit is 1, which is 1 * 5^1 = 1 * 5 = 5\n- The leftmost digit is 4, which is 4 * 5^2 = 4 * 25 = 100\n\nAdding them up: 100 + 5 + 3 = 108 in decimal. So, 413 base 5 is 108 in base 10.\n\nNext, converting 2 base 5 to decimal. Well, that's straightforward because it's a single digit. 2 in base 5 is just 2 in decimal.\n\nSo now, the division problem becomes 108 divided by 2 in decimal. Let me calculate that. 108 ÷ 2 = 54. So the result in decimal is 54. Now, I need to convert 54 back to base 5.\n\nTo convert 54 from decimal to base 5, I need to figure out the coefficients for the powers of 5. The powers of 5 are 1 (5^0), 5 (5^1), 25 (5^2), 125 (5^3), etc. Since 54 is less than 125, the highest power needed is 25 (5^2).\n\nLet me divide 54 by 25. 25 goes into 54 twice (2 * 25 = 50), with a remainder of 4 (54 - 50 = 4). Now, take the remainder 4 and divide by the next lower power of 5, which is 5^1 = 5. 4 divided by 5 is 0 with a remainder of 4. Finally, divide the remainder by 5^0 = 1, which is 4 / 1 = 4.\n\nSo, the coefficients are 2 (for 25), 0 (for 5), and 4 (for 1). Therefore, 54 in decimal is 2*5^2 + 0*5^1 + 4*5^0, which is written as 204 in base 5.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I convert 204 base 5 back to decimal: 2*25 + 0*5 + 4*1 = 50 + 0 + 4 = 54. Yep, that works. So the result of the division is 204 base 5. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Let me verify each part again.\n\nFirst, converting 413 base 5 to decimal. Starting from the right: 3*1 = 3, 1*5 = 5, 4*25 = 100. Total is 3 + 5 + 100 = 108. Correct.\n\nDividing 108 by 2 gives 54. Correct. Converting 54 to base 5. Let's do it step by step. \n\nHow many times does 25 go into 54? 2*25 = 50, 3*25 = 75 which is too much. So 2, remainder 4. Then how many times does 5 go into 4? 0 times, remainder 4. Then 4 ones. So digits are 2, 0, 4. So 204 base 5. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to convert decimal to base 5 is by dividing by 5 and keeping track of the remainders. Let me try that method as a check.\n\nTake 54. Divide by 5: 54 ÷ 5 = 10 with a remainder of 4. Then divide 10 by 5: 10 ÷ 5 = 2 with a remainder of 0. Then divide 2 by 5: 0 with a remainder of 2. Now, writing the remainders from last to first: 2, 0, 4. So 204 base 5. Same result. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the quotient is 204 base 5. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to perform the division directly in base 5 without converting to decimal. Maybe that's a good idea to confirm. Although division in base 5 might be trickier for me since I'm more used to base 10.\n\nSo, let's attempt long division in base 5. Dividing 413_5 by 2_5.\n\nFirst, let me recall how long division works. In base 10, we divide, multiply, subtract, bring down. The same steps apply here, but all operations must be done in base 5.\n\nSo, let me write down the problem: 2_5 ) 413_5.\n\nFirst, note that 2_5 is 2 in decimal, but I need to perform operations in base 5. Let me try to figure out how many times 2_5 goes into the first digit of 413_5.\n\nThe first digit is 4_5. Let me think: 2_5 times what in base 5 gives me something less than or equal to 4_5. Well, 2_5 * 2_5 = 4_5. Because 2*2 = 4 in decimal, which is 4 in base 5 as well. So, 2_5 goes into 4_5 exactly 2_5 times. \n\nSo, I put 2_5 as the first digit of the quotient. Multiply 2_5 by 2_5: 2*2=4, so 4_5. Subtract that from 4_5: 4_5 - 4_5 = 0_5. Then bring down the next digit, which is 1_5. \n\nNow, we have 01_5. How many times does 2_5 go into 1_5? Since 2_5 is larger than 1_5, it goes 0 times. So we put 0_5 as the next digit in the quotient. Multiply 0_5 by 2_5 is 0_5. Subtract that from 1_5, we still have 1_5. Bring down the next digit, which is 3_5. Now we have 13_5.\n\nNow, how many times does 2_5 go into 13_5? Let me figure this out. First, convert 13_5 to decimal to see how much it is. 1*5 + 3 = 8. 2_5 is 2 decimal. So 8 divided by 2 is 4. So 4 times. But 4 in base 5 is still 4. So, does 2_5 * 4_5 equal 13_5?\n\nLet me check: 2_5 * 4_5. Let me compute this in base 5. Alternatively, convert both to decimal: 2 * 4 = 8 decimal. Convert 8 decimal to base 5: 5*1 + 3 = 13_5. Yes, so 2_5 * 4_5 = 13_5. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, 2_5 goes into 13_5 exactly 4_5 times. So we put 4_5 as the last digit of the quotient. Multiply 4_5 by 2_5 gives 13_5, subtract that from 13_5 gives 0. So there's no remainder.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the quotient is 2 (from first step) 0 (second step) 4 (third step), so 204_5. Which matches the previous result. Great, so that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, converting to decimal or performing division directly in base 5, I arrive at the same answer, 204 base 5. \n\nJust to make sure, let me perform a multiplication check in base 5. If I multiply 204_5 by 2_5, I should get 413_5. Let me verify that.\n\nFirst, let me compute 204_5 * 2_5.\n\nMultiplying in base 5:\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n     204_5\n   x   2_5\n   --------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit: 4_5 * 2_5. Let me compute that. 4*2=8 decimal. Convert 8 to base 5: 1*5 + 3 = 13_5. So we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 0_5 * 2_5 + carryover 1. 0*2=0 + 1 = 1. So we write down 1.\n\nNext digit: 2_5 * 2_5. 2*2=4 decimal, which is 4_5. No carryover. So the result is 4 1 3, i.e., 413_5. Perfect! That matches the original dividend. So this confirms that 204_5 * 2_5 = 413_5, so the division is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the quotient is indeed 204 in base 5.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to do the multiplication entirely in base 5 without converting to decimal, let me try that as well.\n\nMultiplying 4_5 * 2_5:\n\nIn base 5, 4*2. Well, 4*2 in decimal is 8. Since base 5 digits go up to 4, 8 divided by 5 is 1 with remainder 3, so 13_5. So yes, same as before.\n\nThen 0*2 + 1 (carryover) is 1, as above.\n\nThen 2*2 is 4. So the result is 413_5. Yep.\n\nTherefore, everything checks out. \n\nAnother thing to consider: when I did the division in base 5, I had to figure out how many times 2_5 goes into various numbers. For the first digit, 4_5 divided by 2_5 is straightforward. For the second digit, when I had 1_5, since 2_5 doesn't go into 1_5, I put a 0 and brought down the next digit. Then, for 13_5 divided by 2_5, I needed to figure out that it was 4_5. Since I was working in base 5, it's helpful to remember or quickly calculate that 2_5 * 4_5 is 13_5. If I had forgotten, converting to decimal would have been a good way to check.\n\nSo, overall, whether converting to decimal or doing operations in base 5, I arrive at the same answer. The key steps were careful conversion between bases and verifying through multiplication. It's easy to make a mistake in the conversion steps, so cross-verifying with alternative methods is essential.\n\nLet me recap all steps once more:\n\n1. Convert 413_5 to decimal:\n   - 4*25 + 1*5 + 3*1 = 100 + 5 + 3 = 108\n2. Convert 2_5 to decimal:\n   - 2\n3. Divide 108 / 2 = 54\n4. Convert 54 back to base 5:\n   - 54 / 5 = 10, remainder 4\n   - 10 / 5 = 2, remainder 0\n   - 2 / 5 = 0, remainder 2\n   - Reading remainders from last to first: 2, 0, 4 => 204_5\n5. Verify via base 5 division:\n   - 2_5 into 413_5 gives 204_5\n6. Verify via multiplication:\n   - 204_5 * 2_5 = 413_5\n\nAll steps confirm that the result is 204_5. Therefore, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nAnother thing I thought about: sometimes when dividing in different bases, there might be a remainder, but in this case, since 413_5 is divisible by 2_5 (as 108 is divisible by 2), there's no remainder. If there had been a remainder, I would need to express it appropriately in base 5 as well. But since the division is exact, we don't have to worry about that here.\n\nJust to explore, let's say if there was a remainder. For example, if we had something like 414_5 divided by 2_5. Converting 414_5 to decimal: 4*25 + 1*5 + 4 = 100 + 5 + 4 = 109. Divided by 2 is 54.5, which would be 54 with a remainder of 1. Converting back, 54 is 204_5 with a remainder of 1, which is 1_5. But in this problem, since there's no remainder, we don't have to do that.\n\nAnother check: if I add 204_5 + 204_5, I should get 413_5. Let me verify that.\n\nAdding 204_5 + 204_5:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8 decimal. In base 5, 8 is 1*5 + 3, so write down 3, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 0 + 0 + 1 (carryover) = 1. Write down 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 + 2 = 4. Write down 4.\n\nSo the result is 4 1 3, which is 413_5. Perfect! That's another verification that 204_5 + 204_5 = 413_5, hence 204_5 * 2_5 = 413_5. Therefore, the division is correct.\n\nThis gives me even more confidence in the answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered multiple methods, verified through conversion, direct division in base 5, and multiplication checks. All methods led to the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I believe the quotient is indeed 204 in base 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe quotient of $413_5 \\div 2_5$ in base 5 is \\boxed{204_5}.\n</think>"}
