First, I need to understand the question and figure out which elements X and Y could be. The problem states that X and Y are elements in the third period. The algebraic sum of the highest positive valence and the lowest negative valence of Y is 6. Also, they form a compound that exists as [XY4]+ [XY6]-. Then, I need to determine which of the given statements (A to D) is incorrect.\n\nAlright, let's start by analyzing the valence information for Y. The highest positive valence and the lowest negative valence add up to 6. Let me recall that for elements in the main groups, the highest positive oxidation state is usually equal to the group number minus 8 (for elements in periods beyond the first), but maybe I should think in terms of group numbers. Wait, third period elements, so group 1 to group 18 (but third period has elements from Na to Ar, groups 1-18, but in the third period specifically, groups 1, 2, 13-18).\n\nWait, oxidation states. For nonmetals, the highest oxidation state is typically the group number minus 8. For example, chlorine (group 17) can have +7 oxidation state. The lowest negative oxidation state is usually -(8 - group number). For example, chlorine can have -1. So if Y is a nonmetal, then the highest positive oxidation state would be (group number - 8) but wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, for example, for oxygen (group 16), the highest oxidation state is +6 (in compounds like H2O2? No, wait, oxygen usually has -2, but in some cases, like OF2, it's +2. Wait, maybe this is more complicated. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the highest positive oxidation state for a nonmetal is usually equal to its group number minus 8. For example, group 17 elements (like Cl) can have +7, group 16 can have +6 (like in SO3, sulfur is +6). The lowest negative oxidation state is -(8 - group number). So for group 17, it's -1, group 16 is -2, group 15 is -3, etc. So if we take the algebraic sum of the highest positive and lowest negative oxidation states, that would be (group number - 8) + [-(8 - group number)].\n\nLet me compute this. Let me denote group number as G. Then the sum is (G - 8) + [-(8 - G)] = G - 8 -8 + G = 2G - 16. According to the problem, this sum is 6. So 2G - 16 = 6 → 2G = 22 → G = 11. But group 11? Wait, third period elements are groups 1, 2, 13-18. Group 11 is copper, silver, gold, which are in the d-block. But third period only goes up to group 18. So group 11 is not in the third period. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculation or reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me check again. Let me think of specific elements. Let's take sulfur (group 16). Highest positive oxidation state is +6 (like in SO4^2-), and lowest negative is -2. Sum is +6 + (-2) = 4. Not 6. How about chlorine (group 17)? Highest +7, lowest -1. Sum is 7 + (-1) = 6. Oh! There we go. So if Y is in group 17, the sum is 6. So Y is a group 17 element in the third period, which is chlorine (Cl). Because third period group 17 is Cl. So Y is Cl.\n\nSo Y is Cl. Now, the compound formed by X and Y is [XY4]+ [XY6]-. Let's think about that. The cation is [XY4]+ and the anion is [XY6]-. Let's figure out what X could be. Let's consider the oxidation states here. Let's take the cation [XY4]+. Let me denote the oxidation state of X as x, and Y (Cl) as y. In the cation, the total charge is +1. So x + 4y = +1. Similarly, in the anion [XY6]-, x + 6y = -1.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. x + 4y = +1\n2. x + 6y = -1\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x + 6y) - (x + 4y) = -1 - 1 → 2y = -2 → y = -1\n\nSo the oxidation state of Y (Cl) in these ions is -1? Wait, but Cl typically has -1 oxidation state in many compounds, but in some cases, like in ClO4-, it's +7. However, here in both ions, the oxidation state of Y is -1. Let's check.\n\nIf y = -1, then plugging into equation 1: x + 4*(-1) = +1 → x - 4 = +1 → x = +5.\n\nSo X has an oxidation state of +5 in the cation [XY4]+, and same in the anion? Wait, in the anion, x + 6*(-1) = -1 → x -6 = -1 → x = +5. So yes, X is +5 in both ions. So X can exhibit +5 oxidation state. Now, X is an element in the third period. Let's think about which third period element can have +5 oxidation state.\n\nThird period elements: Na (group 1), Mg (group 2), Al (group 13), Si (group 14), P (group 15), S (group 16), Cl (group 17), Ar (group 18). But X is different from Y (which is Cl). So X could be, for example, P (phosphorus) which can have +5 oxidation state (like in H3PO4). Or maybe another element.\n\nBut let's check the formula [XY4]+. If X is P and Y is Cl, then [PCl4]+. What is that? PCl4+ is a known ion, for example, in phosphorus pentachloride, but PCl5 is neutral. Wait, but PCl4+ would be like if you have PCl5 losing a Cl-? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is another element. Let's think about the possible ions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is Al? But Al typically has +3 oxidation state. If X is Al, then in [AlCl4]-, but here it's [XY4]+. So if X is Al, then [AlCl4]- is a known anion, but here the cation is [XY4]+. So maybe not Al.\n\nWait, if X is in group 15, like P, then +5 is possible. Let's think about [PCl4]+. For example, in some compounds, like when PCl5 is in a non-aqueous solvent, it can dissociate into PCl4+ and PCl6- ions. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the case. PCl5 can exist as [PCl4]+ [PCl6]- in solution. So if X is P (phosphorus) and Y is Cl (chlorine), then the compound would be PCl5, which can dissociate into [PCl4]+ and [PCl6]-. Therefore, X is phosphorus (P) in group 15, third period.\n\nSo X is P (group 15), Y is Cl (group 17), both third period elements. Now, let's check the options given.\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) Atomic radius: X > Y\n\n(B) Reducing property of simple hydrides: X > Y\n\n(C) The element formed by elements of the same period: Y has the strongest oxidizing property\n\n(D) The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X\n\nFirst, let's check each option.\n\nStarting with (A): Atomic radius X (P) vs Y (Cl). In the same period, atomic radius decreases from left to right. Since P is group 15 and Cl is group 17, P is to the left of Cl, so atomic radius of P is larger than Cl. Therefore, (A) is correct. So (A) is correct, so it's not the incorrect statement.\n\n(B): Reducing property of simple hydrides: X > Y. The hydrides of X (P) is PH3, and Y (Cl) is HCl. Reducing property refers to how easily the hydride donates electrons, acts as a reducing agent. PH3 is a stronger reducing agent than HCl? Let me recall. HCl is a strong acid, but not a good reducing agent. PH3 is a weak acid but is a good reducing agent. For example, PH3 can reduce AgNO3 to Ag, while HCl does not do that. Therefore, PH3 has stronger reducing property than HCl. Therefore, (B) says reducing property of X's hydride (PH3) is greater than Y's (HCl), which is correct. So (B) is correct, not the incorrect statement.\n\n(C): The element formed by elements of the same period: Y has the strongest oxidizing property. Since Y is Cl (group 17), in the same period (third period), the elements are from Na to Ar. The oxidizing property for nonmetals increases from left to right. The strongest oxidizing agent in the third period would be Cl? Wait, but Ar is a noble gas, which is inert. The halogens, Cl, are strong oxidizing agents. However, in the third period, the elements in group 17 (Cl) is the strongest oxidizing agent? Let me think. Fluorine is the strongest oxidizing agent, but F is in the second period. In the third period, Cl is the only halogen. So among third period elements, Cl would have the strongest oxidizing property? Let me check. For example, compared to sulfur (group 16), Cl is a stronger oxidizing agent. Yes, Cl2 can oxidize S^2- to S, or something like that. So (C) is correct. Therefore, (C) is correct.\n\n(D): The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X. Wait, the statement says \"The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X\". Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again. The original statement is: \"The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X\". Maybe it's supposed to say \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\"? Or maybe \"The first ionization energy of the element in the same period is less than that of X\"? The wording is ambiguous. Wait, the original Chinese might have been translated to English. Let me check the original statement again:\n\n\"(D) The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X\"\n\nPossibly mistranslated. Maybe it's supposed to be \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y in the same period.\" Or perhaps \"The first ionization energy of the element (Y?) in the same period is less than that of X.\" Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the original statement is saying that \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\", or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is saying that for the same period, the first ionization energy is less than that of element X. But that doesn't make much sense. Let me think again. Since X is P (group 15) and Y is Cl (group 17) in the third period. Let me recall the trend for first ionization energy in the third period.\n\nIn general, first ionization energy increases across a period, but there are exceptions. For third period:\n\nNa (group 1) < Mg (group 2) < Al (group 13) < Si (group 14) < P (group 15) > S (group 16) < Cl (group 17) < Ar (group 18)\n\nWait, the trend is that from Na to Ar, IE generally increases, but with dips at Al (lower than Mg) and S (lower than P). So for group 15 (P) and group 17 (Cl):\n\nThe first ionization energy of P is higher than that of S but lower than that of Cl. Wait, let me check actual values. The first ionization energy of P is about 1012 kJ/mol, Cl is about 1251 kJ/mol. So Cl has higher first ionization energy than P. So if statement (D) is saying that the first ionization energy of X (P) is less than that of Y (Cl), then (D) would be correct. But the problem says \"The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X\". Maybe it's mistranslated. If the original statement is supposed to be \"The first ionization energy of Y is less than that of X\", then it would be incorrect. But if it's \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\", then it's correct.\n\nLooking back at the original options:\n\n(D) The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X.\n\nPossibly the intended meaning is that \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y in the same period.\" If that's the case, then since X (P) has lower IE than Y (Cl), the statement is correct. But if the statement is phrased incorrectly and actually claims something else, like that the first ionization energy of X is higher than Y, then it would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is trying to say that \"The first ionization energy of the element in the same period (as X or Y?) is less than that of X.\" But without clearer wording, it's challenging. However, given that X is P and Y is Cl, and knowing their IE values, let's assume that option D is saying that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y. Therefore, since P has lower IE than Cl, the statement is correct. Therefore, if (D) is correct, then the incorrect statement would be another option. But the question says \"the following statement is incorrect\", so we need to find which one is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me re-express option D as per possible correct translation. If the original Chinese was something like “The first ionization energy of X is less than that of the element in the same period,” but that's not specific. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to say \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y in the same period.\" If that's the case, then since P (X) has lower IE than Cl (Y), then (D) is correct. Hence, all options (A)-(D) would be correct except one.\n\nWait, but let's check each again:\n\n(A) Atomic radius X > Y: P (X) has larger radius than Cl (Y). Correct.\n\n(B) Reducing property of hydrides X > Y: PH3 > HCl. Correct.\n\n(C) Y has the strongest oxidizing property in the same period. In third period, Cl is the strongest oxidizing element (among nonmetals). Correct.\n\n(D) If the statement is that first ionization energy of X is less than Y, then correct. But if the statement is phrased incorrectly, maybe it's saying something else. Let me check the exact wording again:\n\n\"(D) The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X\"\n\nPossibly mistranslated. Maybe it's supposed to be \"The first ionization energy of the element in the same period is less than that of X\". For example, if there's another element in the same period with lower IE than X. But since X is P, which has IE lower than Cl but higher than S and Al, etc. But the statement is unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to compare X's IE with another element's IE in the same period. Without clear wording, it's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original statement is saying that \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of the element in the same period,\" but which element? If it's comparing to Y, then as above. However, given that the options are given in Chinese and translated, perhaps there's a standard way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is saying that \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of the element in the same period,\" but since X is in the same period as Y, perhaps it's comparing to another element. This is too ambiguous. However, considering that all other options seem correct, and if we assume that option D is supposed to say that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y, then (D) is correct. However, if the statement is saying that the first ionization energy of X is greater than Y, then it would be incorrect.\n\nWait, let me think again. The original statement is: \"The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X\". Maybe it's supposed to mean that \"The first ionization energy of the element in the same period (as X?) is less than that of X\". But which element? If it's referring to Y being in the same period, then maybe it's saying that Y's IE is less than X's. But we know Y (Cl) has higher IE than X (P). So if the statement is claiming that Y's IE is less than X's, then it's incorrect. But the wording is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is trying to say that \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of the element in the same period,\" but without specifying which element. This is too vague. However, given that in the third period, there are elements with lower IE than X (P), like S (group 16), Al (group 13), Si (group 14), etc. But the statement doesn't specify which element. If the statement is saying that there exists an element in the same period with lower IE than X, then it's correct. But if it's saying that all elements have higher IE than X, which is not true. But the wording is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, if the statement is \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of the element in the same period,\" but the element is unspecified. Since the problem is about X and Y, maybe it's supposed to compare X and Y. Given that, and considering that in Chinese, sometimes the translation might have issues, perhaps option D is intended to say that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y. If that's the case, then since X (P) has lower IE than Y (Cl), then the statement is correct. Hence, all options are correct, which can't be, since the question says one is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in identifying X and Y. Let me double-check.\n\nEarlier, I concluded that Y is Cl (group 17) because the sum of highest positive and lowest negative oxidation states is 6. For Cl: highest is +7 (as in HClO4), lowest is -1. Sum is 7 + (-1) = 6. Correct. So Y is Cl. Then, the compound [XY4]+ [XY6]-, which I thought was PCl5 dissociating into [PCl4]+ and [PCl6]-. Therefore, X is P (phosphorus). Is there another possibility?\n\nLet me check other elements. Suppose Y is another element. Let's see. If Y is group 17, sum is 6. Suppose Y is group 15? Let me recalculate. For group 15, highest oxidation state is +5, lowest is -3. Sum is +5 + (-3) = +2 ≠ 6. Group 16: +6 and -2 → sum 4. Group 14: +4 and -4? Wait, group 14 elements like Si can have +4 and -4? But sum would be 0. Not 6. Group 13: +3 and -5? No, group 13 elements typically don't have negative oxidation states. So only group 17 gives sum 6. Hence Y is Cl.\n\nThen X is P. So X is group 15, third period. Now, let's check the ionization energies again. First ionization energy of P is about 1012 kJ/mol. For Cl, it's 1251 kJ/mol. So Cl has higher IE than P. Therefore, if option D says \"The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X,\" maybe it's supposed to say that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of another element in the same period, which is true. But if the statement is phrased as \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y,\" then it's correct. But if the statement is phrased as \"The first ionization energy of X is greater than that of Y,\" then it's incorrect. Given the ambiguity, but since the other options seem correct, and if we assume that option D is incorrectly stating that X has higher IE than Y or something, but need to figure out.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n(D) The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X.\n\nIf we interpret this as \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of the element in the same period,\" which element? If it's referring to Y, then since X (P) has lower IE than Y (Cl), then the statement would be correct if it says \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y,\" but if the statement is phrased as \"The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X,\" maybe it's saying that there exists an element in the same period with lower IE than X. Which is true, because elements like S, Al, Si, etc., have lower IE than P? Wait, no. Let me check the actual IE values:\n\nThird period elements first ionization energies (approximate):\n\nNa: ~496 kJ/mol\n\nMg: ~738 kJ/mol\n\nAl: ~577 kJ/mol (exception, lower than Mg)\n\nSi: ~786 kJ/mol\n\nP: ~1012 kJ/mol\n\nS: ~1000 kJ/mol (lower than P)\n\nCl: ~1251 kJ/mol\n\nAr: ~1520 kJ/mol\n\nSo P (1012) has higher IE than S (1000), Al (577), Si (786), Mg (738), Na (496). So there are elements in the same period with lower IE than X (P). Therefore, if the statement is saying that there exists an element in the same period with lower IE than X, then it's correct. However, if the statement is saying that all elements in the same period have lower IE than X, which is not true because Cl and Ar have higher IE. But the wording is unclear.\n\nBut given the options, and if we consider that option D might be incorrectly stating that the first ionization energy of X is greater than that of Y, which would be incorrect, but since the wording is confusing, perhaps the intended meaning is that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y, which is correct. However, if the statement is actually saying the opposite, then it would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original statement (D) is saying \"The first ionization energy of X is less than that of the element in the same period,\" but since there are elements with both higher and lower IE, it's ambiguous. However, given that all other options seem correct, and if there must be one incorrect, perhaps (D) is incorrect. Wait, but why?\n\nWait, let's check the options again. If (D) is supposed to say that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y, then it's correct. If it's saying that the first ionization energy of X is greater than Y, then it's incorrect. Given that the original Chinese might have been clearer, but given the translation provided, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another error in my identification of X and Y. Let me check if there's another possible X. Suppose Y is Cl, and the compound is [XY4]+ [XY6]-. What if X is another element?\n\nFor example, if X is S (sulfur), then could there be such ions? Let's check oxidation states. For [SX4]+ and [SX6]-. But sulfur usually has oxidation states like -2, +4, +6. If in [SX4]+, assuming X is Cl, then [SCl4]+? Not a common ion. Whereas PCl4+ is known. So likely X is P.\n\nTherefore, X is P, Y is Cl. Now, regarding option D: if it's saying that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y, then it's correct. But if the option is saying something else, like that the first ionization energy of X is higher than Y, then it's incorrect. Given the translation provided, I think the intended meaning is likely that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y, making (D) correct. But then all options are correct, which can't be.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in option (C). Let's re-examine option (C): \"The element formed by elements of the same period: Y has the strongest oxidizing property.\" So in the same period (third period), Y is Cl. Are there other elements in the same period that have stronger oxidizing properties? For example, oxygen? But oxygen is in the second period. In the third period, the nonmetals are P, S, Cl. Among these, Cl is the strongest oxidizing agent. Sulfur is less, phosphorus is even less. So (C) is correct. Hence, (C) is correct.\n\nSo if all options are correct except one, but according to my analysis, they all seem correct. But the question says one is incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's check option (B) again: \"Reducing property of simple hydrides: X > Y\". X is P, hydride PH3; Y is Cl, hydride HCl. Reducing property: PH3 is a stronger reducing agent than HCl. This is correct because HCl is a strong acid and not a good reducing agent, while PH3 can act as a reducing agent. For example, PH3 reduces AgNO3 to metallic silver, while HCl does not. Therefore, (B) is correct.\n\nOption (A): Atomic radius X > Y. P has larger atomic radius than Cl. Correct.\n\nSo if all options are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, there must be an error in my reasoning. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying X and Y. Let me check the algebra again for the oxidation states.\n\nGiven that Y is Cl, and the compound is [XY4]+ and [XY6]-. We found that in these ions, Y has -1 oxidation state, and X has +5. But for X to have +5 oxidation state, what element in the third period can do that? P can have +5 (like in PCl5), S can have +6, but also +4. Al is +3. Si can have +4. So P is the likely candidate. But let's think about another possibility: what if X is S?\n\nIf X is S, then in [SCl4]+, oxidation state of S would be x + 4*(-1) = +1 → x = +5. Sulfur can have +5 oxidation state? For example, in H2SO3, sulfur is +4; in H2SO4, +6. Is there a compound where sulfur is +5? Maybe in some intermediates or less common compounds. However, it's less common compared to phosphorus having +5 oxidation state. The more likely candidate for +5 is P. Hence, X is P.\n\nTherefore, my identification of X as P and Y as Cl seems correct.\n\nNow, let's look again at option (D). If the statement is saying that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y, then it's correct. If it's saying that the first ionization energy of X is greater than Y, then it's incorrect. Given the translation is ambiguous, but given that the options must have one incorrect statement, and all others seem correct, perhaps the error is in option (D). Maybe the statement is actually claiming that the first ionization energy of X is greater than that of Y, which would be incorrect. Given that the original Chinese might have said something like \"The first ionization energy of X is greater than that of Y,\" which would be incorrect because P has lower IE than Cl. But due to translation issues, it's phrased as \"The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X.\" If we interpret this as \"The first ionization energy of Y is less than that of X,\" then it would be incorrect because Y (Cl) has higher IE than X (P). But the phrasing is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is trying to say that the first ionization energy of X is less than that of the element in the same period with the highest ionization energy. Since Ar has the highest IE in the third period, and X (P) has lower IE than Ar, then it would be correct. But this is too speculative.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering that in standard tests, such questions usually have clear comparisons between X and Y, and given that the other options are correct, I think the intended incorrect statement is (D), assuming that it is claiming that the first ionization energy of X is greater than Y, which is false. Hence, the incorrect statement is (D).\n\nWait, but let me check another angle. The first ionization energy of X (P) is 1012 kJ/mol. The first ionization energy of Y (Cl) is 1251 kJ/mol. So the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y. So if option (D) says \"The first ionization energy in the same period is less than the element X,\" it might mean that the first ionization energy of the element (Y?) is less than X, which would be incorrect. For example, if the statement is saying that Y's IE is less than X's, which is false, then (D) is incorrect. Given the translation issues, this is plausible. Therefore, assuming that option (D) is incorrectly stating that Y has lower IE than X, making (D) incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is (D).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
