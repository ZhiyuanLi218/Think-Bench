The question is about a chemical reaction between sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), producing sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and water (H2O). The task is to identify which of the four given statements is incorrect.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reaction. Let me write it down again to make sure I have the correct formulas:\n\nH2SO4 + Na2SO3 → Na2SO4 + SO2↑ + H2O\n\nI should check if this equation is balanced. Let's count the atoms on each side.\n\nLeft side:\n- H: 2 (from H2SO4) + 2 (from Na2SO3?) Wait, Na2SO3 doesn't have H. So total H is 2 from H2SO4.\n- S: 1 (from H2SO4) + 1 (from Na2SO3) = 2 S\n- O: 4 (from H2SO4) + 3 (from SO3 in Na2SO3) = 7 O? Wait, H2SO4 has 4 O, Na2SO3 has 3 O. Total O is 4 + 3 = 7. But also, there are O in water and SO2 on the right. Let me check the right side.\n\nRight side:\n- Na2SO4: 4 O\n- SO2: 2 O\n- H2O: 1 O\nTotal O: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. So O is balanced. H: On the right, H2O has 2 H, so left side has 2 H (from H2SO4). So H is balanced. Sulfur: Left has 2 S (1 from H2SO4 and 1 from Na2SO3). On the right, Na2SO4 has 1 S, SO2 has 1 S. So total 2 S. So balanced. Sodium: 2 on left (Na2SO3) and 2 on right (Na2SO4). So balanced. So the equation is balanced as written. Okay.\n\nNow, the question is about the statements. Let's go through each option.\n\nOption A: H2SO4 is the oxidizing agent in this reaction.\n\nTo determine if H2SO4 is an oxidizing agent, I need to look at oxidation states of sulfur in the reactants and products.\n\nIn H2SO4: Sulfur's oxidation state. Let's calculate. H is +1, O is -2. So for H2SO4: 2*(+1) + S + 4*(-2) = 0. So 2 + S - 8 = 0 → S = +6.\n\nIn Na2SO3: Sulfur's oxidation state. Na is +1, O is -2. So 2*(+1) + S + 3*(-2) = 0 → 2 + S -6 = 0 → S = +4.\n\nIn Na2SO4: Same as H2SO4, S is +6.\n\nIn SO2: S is +4? Wait, O is -2, so S + 2*(-2) = 0 → S = +4. Wait, but in the reaction, Na2SO3 (S +4) is reacting with H2SO4 (S +6) to produce Na2SO4 (S +6) and SO2 (S +4). Wait, so sulfur goes from +4 in Na2SO3 to +6 in Na2SO4, and also from +6 in H2SO4 to +4 in SO2?\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal reactants: H2SO4 (S +6), Na2SO3 (S +4). Products: Na2SO4 (S +6), SO2 (S +4), H2O.\n\nSo for the sulfur in Na2SO3: it goes from +4 to +6 in Na2SO4. That is oxidation (increase in oxidation state). For the sulfur in H2SO4: it goes from +6 to +4 in SO2. That is reduction (decrease in oxidation state). Therefore, H2SO4 is acting as an oxidizing agent because it is being reduced. The Na2SO3 is being oxidized. So statement A is correct. So A is a correct statement, not the incorrect one. So A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: Na2SO3 is easily oxidized by O2 in the air.\n\nSodium sulfite, Na2SO3. If it's exposed to air, which contains oxygen, would it oxidize? Sulfite (SO3^2-) is a reducing agent and can be oxidized by oxygen in the air to sulfate (SO4^2-). For example, in the presence of moisture and oxygen, sodium sulfite can oxidize to sodium sulfate. So this is a known reaction. So statement B is correct. Therefore, B is not the incorrect answer.\n\nOption C: Na2SO4 is an ionic compound containing covalent bonds.\n\nSodium sulfate is an ionic compound composed of Na+ ions and SO4^2- ions. The sulfate ion itself has covalent bonds between sulfur and oxygen. So yes, the compound is ionic (between Na+ and sulfate), but within the sulfate ion, there are covalent bonds. Therefore, statement C is correct. So C is not the incorrect answer.\n\nOption D: SO2 is the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain.\n\nSulfur dioxide is a major contributor to acid rain. When SO2 is released into the atmosphere, it reacts with water vapor to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which contributes to acid rain. However, another major contributor is nitrogen oxides (NOx), especially NO2, which forms nitric acid (HNO3). However, the question states \"major harmful pollutant\". Depending on the source, in some cases SO2 is considered a major contributor. For example, coal-fired power plants emit a lot of SO2. But is SO2 the \"major\" one? Or is it considered that both SO2 and NOx are major? However, the statement says \"major harmful pollutant causing acid rain\". I think SO2 is indeed a major one. But maybe the question is trying to trick us here. Let me think again.\n\nAcid rain is primarily caused by sulfuric acid and nitric acid. SO2 leads to sulfuric acid, and NOx leads to nitric acid. The contribution can vary by region. For example, in areas with heavy coal burning, SO2 might be the bigger contributor. In other areas, like near cities with lots of vehicle emissions (which produce NOx), nitric acid might be more significant. However, generally, both are considered major contributors. But the statement says \"the major harmful pollutant\". If the question is from a textbook or standard curriculum, it's possible that they consider SO2 as a major one. However, is there a case where this statement is incorrect?\n\nWait, the question is about whether the statement is incorrect. So if the statement says SO2 is the major, but in reality, maybe it's not the only or not the major? For example, if in some contexts, other substances are more significant. But the question is about the statement being incorrect in general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the major harmful pollutant for acid rain is considered to be NOx? Or is SO2 considered a major one?\n\nI need to recall. From what I remember, both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are primary contributors. In the US, for example, the EPA has regulations on both. However, historically, sulfur dioxide was a bigger problem, but with regulations, nitrogen oxides have become a larger component in some regions. However, the question is about whether SO2 is the major. The term \"major\" is a bit vague, but if the statement is presented as correct, then maybe it is. However, maybe the answer is D, because while SO2 is a major contributor, the primary cause of acid rain is actually a combination, and maybe the major is considered to be something else. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is incorrect because the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain is actually sulfuric acid (H2SO4) rather than SO2. But SO2 is the precursor. However, the question is about the substances involved in the reaction. The reaction produces SO2. So in the context of this reaction, maybe the SO2 is a byproduct that contributes to acid rain. But is the statement correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain is considered to be NOx. But I think both are considered major. However, if the question states that SO2 is the major, and in reality, it's not the only or not the primary, then D would be incorrect.\n\nBut I need to think about standard educational material. For example, in many textbooks, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are both cited as the primary causes of acid rain. However, if the question is from a source that considers only one as the major, then the answer would vary. However, given that the question is in Chinese (the original user might be Chinese, given the structure), but I need to rely on general knowledge.\n\nIn general, sulfur dioxide is a major contributor to acid rain. So statement D is correct. Therefore, if all statements A, B, C, D are correct, then the question is wrong. But the question says that one statement is incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me check again the oxidation states. Let me confirm the roles of oxidizing and reducing agents.\n\nOriginal reaction:\n\nH2SO4 + Na2SO3 → Na2SO4 + SO2 + H2O\n\nSulfur in Na2SO3 is +4. In Na2SO4, it's +6. So it's oxidized. Therefore, Na2SO3 is the reducing agent. H2SO4 has sulfur in +6. In the product SO2, sulfur is +4. So it's reduced. Therefore, H2SO4 is acting as the oxidizing agent. Therefore, statement A is correct.\n\nStatement B: Na2SO3 is easily oxidized by O2. Yes, because sulfite is a reducing agent and can be oxidized by oxygen. For example, 2 Na2SO3 + O2 → 2 Na2SO4. So B is correct.\n\nStatement C: Na2SO4 is ionic with covalent bonds. Yes, as the sulfate ion has covalent bonds. So C is correct.\n\nStatement D: SO2 is the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain. If this is incorrect, then D is the answer. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the major harmful pollutant is considered to be sulfuric acid (H2SO4) rather than SO2. However, SO2 is the precursor. But SO2 itself is a harmful pollutant. However, in terms of acid rain formation, the actual acid is H2SO4. But the question says \"major harmful pollutant causing acid rain\" is SO2. Is that incorrect?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the major pollutant is considered to be NOx. For example, in some regions, nitrogen oxides contribute more. However, the question is not about specific regions but in general. In general, both are considered major. However, if the statement says \"the major\", implying it's the primary, then perhaps it's incorrect because there are other major ones. But the question is about which statement is incorrect. If the statement is presented as correct, but in reality, it's not the only one, but the question says \"the major\", maybe that's incorrect. However, the wording is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe SO2 is not the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain. For example, maybe the primary pollutant is NO2. But I need to check. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), acid rain is caused by both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. So SO2 is a major contributor. Therefore, the statement D is correct. Hence, if all statements are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, there must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me check the reaction again. Is H2SO4 acting as an oxidizing agent? Let me think about the oxidation states again. In H2SO4, sulfur is +6. In the product SO2, sulfur is +4. So it is reduced. Therefore, H2SO4 is acting as an oxidizing agent. So statement A is correct.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the reaction is not a redox reaction? Let me check. If there is a change in oxidation states, it is a redox reaction. Yes, sulfur in Na2SO3 goes from +4 to +6 (oxidized) and sulfur in H2SO4 goes from +6 to +4 (reduced). Therefore, it is a redox reaction. So H2SO4 is the oxidizing agent. Therefore, A is correct.\n\nSo if all statements A, B, C, D are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, then there must be a mistake. However, I need to re-examine each statement again.\n\nOption D: \"SO2 is the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain.\" Is this incorrect? Let me check some facts.\n\nAcid rain is caused by acidic compounds in the atmosphere, mainly sulfuric and nitric acids. These are formed when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere. Therefore, SO2 is a precursor to sulfuric acid, which contributes to acid rain. However, SO2 itself is a harmful pollutant, but in the context of acid rain, the actual acid is H2SO4. However, the question refers to SO2 as the \"major harmful pollutant causing acid rain.\" The term \"causing\" here could be ambiguous. If the question is asking about the direct cause of acid rain, it's the acids (H2SO4 and HNO3). But if it's asking about the precursors, then SO2 and NOx are the major pollutants. However, the statement says SO2 is the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain. Depending on interpretation, this could be correct if considering precursors. However, if the question is referring to the actual acidic components, then SO2 is not the acid itself but a precursor. Therefore, the statement might be incorrect because the major harmful pollutants causing acid rain are the acids (H2SO4 and HNO3), not the precursors like SO2. However, in common terminology, when people refer to the pollutants causing acid rain, they often mean the precursors like SO2 and NOx. For example, the EPA states that \"the primary causes of acid rain are sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)\" which are released into the atmosphere and then form the acids. Therefore, in that context, statement D is correct. Hence, if all statements are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, there's a problem. However, maybe I made a mistake in another statement.\n\nWait, looking back at option C: \"Na2SO4 is an ionic compound containing covalent bonds.\" Sodium sulfate is composed of Na+ ions and sulfate ions (SO4^2-). The sulfate ion has covalent bonds between sulfur and oxygen. So the compound is ionic, but the sulfate ion has covalent bonds. Therefore, the statement is correct. So C is correct.\n\nIf all four statements are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, there must be an error. But since the question is presented as having one incorrect statement, I must have missed something.\n\nWait, let me check statement D again. Maybe the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain is not SO2. For example, in terms of contribution, maybe nitrogen oxides are more significant. But that's region-dependent. However, globally, sulfur dioxide emissions are still a major contributor. According to the World Bank, in 2020, global SO2 emissions were about 94 million metric tons, while NOx emissions were higher, around 120 million metric tons. However, the contribution to acid rain might depend on the chemical processes. For example, each molecule of SO2 can form one molecule of H2SO4, whereas NOx can form HNO3. However, the relative amounts can vary. But the question is about whether SO2 is the major harmful pollutant. If the statement says \"the major,\" implying it's the primary, then perhaps it's incorrect if there are other equally major ones. However, in many educational contexts, both are considered major. But the question might be from a source that considers NOx as the major, making D incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the statement is incorrect because SO2 is not the major, but rather the primary cause is something else. However, without specific context, it's hard to say. Given that the question is in a chemistry context, and the reaction produces SO2, which is a known precursor to acid rain, I think statement D is correct. Therefore, if all statements are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's consider another angle. Maybe the reaction is not a redox reaction? Let me check oxidation states again.\n\nIn H2SO4: S is +6.\n\nIn Na2SO3: S is +4.\n\nIn Na2SO4: S is +6.\n\nIn SO2: S is +4.\n\nSo sulfur is both oxidized (from +4 to +6 in Na2SO4) and reduced (from +6 to +4 in SO2). Therefore, it's a disproportionation reaction? No, because the same element is both oxidized and reduced. But here, two different sulfur atoms are involved. One from Na2SO3 is oxidized, and one from H2SO4 is reduced. So it's a redox reaction with two different sulfur sources. Therefore, H2SO4 is acting as an oxidizing agent (it is reduced), and Na2SO3 is acting as a reducing agent (it is oxidized). Therefore, statement A is correct.\n\nTherefore, if all statements are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, there must be an error in the question. However, given the options, the most likely incorrect statement is D. Why? Because maybe the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain is not SO2 but something else. For example, maybe the major is sulfuric acid itself. However, the question says \"substances involved in the reaction,\" and SO2 is a product. The statement says SO2 is the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain. If the statement is incorrect because SO2 is not the major, but another substance is, then D would be the answer. But I need to verify.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), acid rain is caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These gases can rise into the atmosphere, where chemical reactions turn them into sulfuric and nitric acids. These acids then fall to the ground as acid rain. So SO2 is a precursor, and the actual acid is H2SO4. However, when people refer to the pollutants causing acid rain, they often mean the precursors like SO2 and NOx. Therefore, the statement D is correct in that context. Hence, if all statements are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, there's a problem. However, maybe I made a mistake in another statement.\n\nWait, statement B: \"Na2SO3 is easily oxidized by O2 in the air.\" Is this true? Sodium sulfite can be oxidized by oxygen in the air, especially in the presence of moisture. For example, the reaction is 2 Na2SO3 + O2 → 2 Na2SO4. Therefore, statement B is correct.\n\nSo all statements A, B, C, D seem correct. But the question states that one is incorrect. This suggests that there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nLet me check statement C again: \"Na2SO4 is an ionic compound containing covalent bonds.\" Sodium sulfate is an ionic compound composed of Na+ ions and sulfate ions (SO4^2-). The sulfate ion has covalent bonds between sulfur and oxygen. So the statement is correct. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the statement is incorrect because the sulfate ion has dative bonds or something else? No, covalent bonds include dative bonds. So the statement is correct.\n\nIf all statements are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, perhaps the question is flawed. However, since this is a multiple-choice question with four options, and I need to choose the incorrect one, I have to consider which one might be incorrect based on possible misconceptions.\n\nPerhaps statement D is incorrect because while SO2 contributes to acid rain, the major harmful pollutant is considered to be something else, like NOx. For example, in some contexts, NOx is considered more significant. However, without specific context, it's hard to say. But if I have to choose based on general knowledge, I might say that both are major, but the statement says \"the major,\" implying it's the primary, which might not be accurate. Hence, D is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is correct, and there's another incorrect statement. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another possibility: In the reaction, is H2SO4 acting as an oxidizing agent? Let me think about the reaction mechanism. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and a strong oxidizing agent. In this reaction, it's reacting with sodium sulfite. Sodium sulfite is a reducing agent. The reaction produces sodium sulfate, sulfur dioxide, and water. Since sulfuric acid is being reduced to SO2, it is indeed acting as an oxidizing agent. So statement A is correct.\n\nTherefore, if all statements are correct, but the question says one is incorrect, there must be an error. However, since the user has presented this as a valid question, I need to find the incorrect one.\n\nLet me think about statement D again. Maybe the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain is not SO2 but something else. For example, maybe the major is sulfuric acid (H2SO4), but the question says SO2. Or maybe the major is considered to be NOx. If the statement says SO2 is the major, but in reality, it's not, then D is incorrect.\n\nAccording to the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), in the United States, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the primary causes of acid rain. However, the contribution of each can vary by region. For example, in areas with high coal-fired power plant emissions, SO2 is a larger contributor. In urban areas with more vehicle traffic, NOx might be a larger contributor. However, globally, both are major contributors. The statement says \"the major harmful pollutant causing acid rain,\" implying that SO2 is the primary one. If the question is from a source that considers both as equally major, then the statement is incorrect because it singles out SO2 as the major. However, if the source considers SO2 as a major, then it's correct. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nIn many textbooks, both are cited as major contributors. Therefore, stating that SO2 is the major might be incorrect because it's not the only major one. However, the wording is \"the major,\" which could imply it's the primary. If the question considers that SO2 is one of the major pollutants, then the statement is correct. But if it's supposed to be the primary, then it's incorrect. Given that the question is likely testing knowledge of acid rain causes, and given that both are major, the statement might be incorrect for implying exclusivity. Hence, D is the incorrect statement.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is D.\n</think>"}
