The options are CH4, KI, NaOH, and CH3COOH. Let me start by recalling what an electrolyte is. From what I remember, an electrolyte is a substance that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water, allowing the solution to conduct electricity. Non-electrolytes, on the other hand, don't dissociate into ions and therefore don't conduct electricity when dissolved.\n\nSo, I need to check which of these compounds doesn't dissociate into ions in solution. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: CH4. Methane. I know that methane is a hydrocarbon, a covalent compound. Covalent compounds typically don't dissociate into ions in water unless they're acids or bases. Methane is a neutral molecule, right? It's a gas at room temperature and is non-polar. Since it's non-polar, it probably doesn't dissolve well in water, and even if it does, it wouldn't dissociate into ions. So maybe CH4 is a non-electrolyte. But I should check the others to be sure.\n\nOption B: KI. Potassium iodide. That's an ionic compound. When dissolved in water, it should dissociate into K+ and I- ions. So KI is definitely an electrolyte. So B is out.\n\nOption C: NaOH. Sodium hydroxide. That's a strong base and an ionic compound. When dissolved in water, it dissociates completely into Na+ and OH- ions. So NaOH is a strong electrolyte. So C is also an electrolyte.\n\nOption D: CH3COOH. Acetic acid. Now, acetic acid is a weak acid. It's a covalent compound, but when dissolved in water, it can partially dissociate into H+ and CH3COO- ions. However, since it's a weak acid, the dissociation is incomplete. But even partial dissociation means it's an electrolyte, just a weak one. So D is a weak electrolyte, not a non-electrolyte.\n\nSo comparing all options, A (CH4) doesn't dissociate into ions at all. Even if it's dissolved, which it might not be, it remains as molecules. So it's a non-electrolyte. The rest are either strong or weak electrolytes.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again about acetic acid. If it's a weak electrolyte, then it's still considered an electrolyte. So non-electrolyte would be something that doesn't ionize at all. So yes, CH4 is non-electrolyte. But another thought: are there any exceptions or something I might be missing here?\n\nFor example, some covalent compounds like sugar (C12H22O11) are non-electrolytes because they dissolve but don't ionize. Methane, being a hydrocarbon, similar to sugar in that aspect, would also not ionize. So yes, A is the answer.\n\nSo the answer should be option A, CH4.\n</think>"}
