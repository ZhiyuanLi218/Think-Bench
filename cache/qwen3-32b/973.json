In a well-insulated system, **the heat lost by the solid should equal the heat gained by the water**, regardless of the magnitude of the temperature change. The **temperature change** reflects the **product of mass and specific heat capacity**, not the total energy transfer.\n\n#### **Option B**  \n> *\"Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\"*\n\n- **Correct**. This is in line with the conservation of energy. Even though the solid experienced a larger temperature change (from 100°C to 37°C, a ΔT of 63°C), the water gained an equivalent amount of thermal energy due to its higher mass and specific heat. The **total energy lost by the solid is equal to the energy gained by the water**, assuming no heat loss to the environment.\n\n#### **Option C**  \n> *\"The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\"*\n\n- **Incorrect**. A **greater temperature change** indicates **lower** heat capacity (mass × specific heat). The solid experienced a larger temperature change (63°C) compared to the water (11°C), suggesting that the solid has **lower** heat capacity than the water, not greater.\n\n#### **Option D**  \n> *\"The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\"*\n\n- **Incorrect**. The **equilibrium constant** is a concept from **chemical equilibrium**, not thermal equilibrium. The final temperature being less than the average of the initial temperatures is a result of the **heat capacities** of the two substances and has **no bearing** on an equilibrium constant.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that accurately reflects the physical principles of energy conservation and heat transfer in an insulated system is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{B}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here where a 25 g sample of a solid is heated to 100°C and then put into 100 g of water at 26°C. The final temperature is 37°C. I need to figure out which conclusion is correct from the options A to D. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a hot object is placed in water, heat transfers from the hot object to the water until they reach the same temperature. The heat lost by the hot object should equal the heat gained by the water, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings. But wait, the problem says the container is insulated, so maybe that's the case here. So the basic idea is that the thermal energy lost by the sample equals the thermal energy gained by the water. But let me check the options to see what they're saying.\n\nOption A says the sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the temperature change was more. But if the system is insulated, then according to the law of conservation of energy, the heat lost by the sample should equal the heat gained by the water. So A might be incorrect because it's saying they are not equal. Unless there's some inefficiency, but the container is insulated. So maybe A is wrong.\n\nOption B says even though the sample's temperature changed more, the thermal energy lost equals the energy gained. That sounds more in line with what I just thought. But why does the temperature change more? Because the specific heat or the mass might be different. Let me think. The formula is q = mcΔT, where q is heat, m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change. For the water, the heat gained would be q_water = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water). For the sample, q_sample = m_sample * c_sample * (T_final - T_initial_sample). But since the sample is cooling down, its ΔT would be negative, so the heat lost by the sample is positive. So in reality, q_sample (lost) = -q_water (gained). So the magnitudes should be equal. So B says they are equal, which is correct. But let me check the other options.\n\nOption C says the sample's temperature changed more, so its heat capacity is greater. Wait, heat capacity is mass times specific heat. The sample had a bigger temperature change. Let me think. If the sample lost heat and the water gained it, then the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water. So q_sample = -q_water. Let me plug in the numbers. Let's calculate the heat gained by the water first. The mass of water is 100 g, specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g°C. The temperature change is 37°C - 26°C = 11°C. So q_water = 100 g * 4.184 J/g°C * 11°C = 100 * 4.184 * 11. Let me calculate that. 4.184 * 11 is about 46.024, times 100 is 4602.4 J. So the water gained about 4602 J of heat.\n\nNow the sample lost that amount of heat. The sample's mass is 25 g. Its temperature change is from 100°C to 37°C, so ΔT is -63°C. So q_sample = 25 g * c_sample * (-63°C). The magnitude is 25 * c_sample * 63 = 4602 J. So solving for c_sample: c_sample = 4602 J / (25 g * 63°C) = 4602 / (1575) ≈ 2.92 J/g°C. So the specific heat of the sample is about 2.92 J/g°C, which is less than that of water (4.184). So the heat capacity of the sample (mass * specific heat) is 25 g * 2.92 ≈ 73 J/°C. The heat capacity of the water is 100 g * 4.184 ≈ 418.4 J/°C. So the water's heat capacity is much higher. Therefore, the sample's heat capacity is lower. But option C says the sample's heat capacity must be greater. That's the opposite of what I found. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D talks about the equilibrium constant being less than 1. Wait, the problem is about heat transfer, not about a chemical reaction. Equilibrium constants are for reactions, not for thermal equilibrium. So D is probably a distractor. The final temperature being less than the average starting temperatures... Let's check. The starting temperatures are 100°C for the sample and 26°C for water. The average of 100 and 26 is (100 + 26)/2 = 63°C. The final temperature is 37°C, which is less than 63°C. But why does that matter? The equilibrium constant isn't relevant here. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo going back, the correct answer should be B: Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained. Because in an insulated system, the heat lost by the hot object equals the heat gained by the cold one. The temperature change difference is due to differences in mass and specific heat, not the amount of energy transferred.\n\nLet me check again. The sample's temperature changed by 63°C, while the water's changed by 11°C. The sample had a much larger ΔT but a smaller mass and lower specific heat. So even with a small mass and lower specific heat, the large ΔT makes the total energy equal. So B is correct. A is wrong because they should be equal. C is wrong because the heat capacity of the sample is actually lower. D is irrelevant. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
