So the question is about the Tianzhou-1 cargo spacecraft docking with the Tiangong-2 space laboratory. The key here is understanding orbital mechanics and how the combination of two objects affects their orbital parameters.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the combination continues to run along the original orbit of the Tiangong-2, which is a circular orbit. So, the altitude of the orbit doesn't change when they dock. That's important because many orbital parameters depend on the radius of the orbit. Since the orbit remains the same, the radius (r) stays constant.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: Period increases. The orbital period (T) of a satellite in a circular orbit is given by Kepler's third law: T² = (4π²/GM) * r³. Here, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the orbital radius. Since the radius r is the same before and after docking, the period T should remain unchanged. Therefore, the period doesn't increase. So option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Velocity increases. The orbital velocity (v) is given by v = √(GM/r). Again, since r is the same, the velocity should also remain the same. However, wait—this formula assumes that the mass of the orbiting object is negligible compared to the mass of the Earth. But when the two spacecraft dock, the combined mass is larger. Does this affect the orbital velocity? Hmm. Actually, the orbital velocity depends on the mass of the central body (Earth) and the orbital radius, not on the mass of the orbiting object. So even though the combined mass is larger, the velocity required to maintain the orbit at that radius is still the same. So the velocity shouldn't change. So option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Kinetic energy increases. Kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². If the velocity remains the same but the mass increases (since the two spacecraft are now combined), then the kinetic energy should increase. Because m is larger, even though v is the same, the KE increases. So option C is correct.\n\nOption D: Centripetal acceleration increases. Centripetal acceleration (a) is v²/r. Since v and r are the same, the centripetal acceleration should remain the same. Alternatively, centripetal acceleration can also be expressed as GM/r². Since r is the same, a remains the same. So option D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Kinetic energy increases. Let me just verify again. The key here is that when the two objects dock, the total mass of the system increases, but the orbit remains the same. So kinetic energy, which depends on mass, increases. The velocity and period, which depend on the orbital radius and the mass of the Earth, stay the same. Centripetal acceleration also depends on the same factors as velocity. Therefore, the only correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
