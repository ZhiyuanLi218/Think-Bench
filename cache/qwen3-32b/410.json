The initial conditions are pressure P = 1 × 10^5 Pa, volume V = 20 cm³, and temperature T = 273 K. Then the piston is moved downward slowly, allowing heat to escape so the temperature remains constant. The final volume is 5 cm³, and we need to find the resulting pressure. The options are A through D.\n\nHmm. Since the temperature is constant, this sounds like an isothermal process. For an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, Boyle's Law applies, right? Boyle's Law states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional when temperature is constant. The formula is P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.\n\nLet me confirm: if the temperature doesn't change, then according to the ideal gas law PV = nRT, since n and R are constant (assuming the amount of gas doesn't change), then PV must be constant. So yes, P1V1 = P2V2.\n\nSo given that, we can plug in the numbers. The initial pressure P1 is 1 × 10^5 Pa. The initial volume V1 is 20 cm³. The final volume V2 is 5 cm³. We need to find P2.\n\nBut wait, do we need to convert the volumes to cubic meters? Because in the ideal gas law, volume is usually in cubic meters. However, since we're taking a ratio, maybe the units will cancel out? Let me think. If we use V1 and V2 both in cm³, then when we take V1/V2, the units cancel, so we can just use the numerical values. So maybe conversion isn't necessary here.\n\nLet me check with the formula:\n\nP1 * V1 = P2 * V2\n\nSo solving for P2: P2 = P1 * (V1 / V2)\n\nPlugging in numbers: P2 = 1 × 10^5 Pa * (20 cm³ / 5 cm³) = 1 × 10^5 Pa * 4 = 4 × 10^5 Pa.\n\nSo that would be option C. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Since pressure and volume are inversely proportional, if the volume decreases, the pressure should increase. The volume goes from 20 to 5, which is a factor of 1/4, so pressure should increase by a factor of 4. So 1 × 10^5 Pa times 4 is indeed 4 × 10^5 Pa. That seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's a trick here. The problem says the piston is moved downward allowing heat to escape. So the temperature remains constant. So yes, that's an isothermal process. So Boyle's Law applies. So the calculation is straightforward.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, people might confuse Celsius temperature with Kelvin, but here the temperature is given as 273 K, which is 0°C, but since it's already in Kelvin, there's no conversion needed. But since the temperature is constant, we don't even need to worry about its value. The key is that it's constant.\n\nAnother possible mistake: mixing up the initial and final volumes. If someone thought that the pressure increases when volume increases, they might flip the ratio. Let me confirm: if V decreases, P increases. Since V1 is 20, V2 is 5, so volume is decreased, hence pressure increases. So P2 should be higher than P1. Since P1 is 1e5, multiplying by 4 gives 4e5, which is option C. The options are:\n\nA:0.25 × 10^5 Pa (which would be if pressure decreased by factor of 4, which would happen if volume increased by factor of 4)\n\nB:2 × 10^5 Pa (factor of 2, maybe if someone thought volume halved? But here volume is quartered.)\n\nC:4 × 10^5 Pa (our calculation)\n\nD:8 × 10^5 Pa (factor of 8, which would be if, say, adiabatic process with some exponent, but here it's isothermal)\n\nSo D is higher than needed. So answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, if someone made a mistake in calculation: 20 / 5 is 4, so 1e5 * 4 is 4e5. Yes. So answer is C.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option C: 4 × 10^5 Pa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
