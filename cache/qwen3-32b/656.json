Hmm, first, I need to remember what an optically active saturated hydrocarbon is. Optically active means that the molecule has a chiral center, right? So it must have a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Since it's a saturated hydrocarbon, it's an alkane, which means all single bonds and no double or triple bonds. Alkanes have the general formula CnH2n+2. \n\nNow, looking at the options, each gives a percentage composition of carbon and hydrogen, and the EI-MS (electron impact mass spectrometry) data with m/z values. I need to analyze each option step by step.\n\nFirst, let's check the percentage composition. For a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane), the ratio of C to H should fit the formula CnH2n+2. Let's calculate the empirical formula for each option to see if it matches an alkane.\n\nStarting with option A: C 83.72% and H 16.27%. Let's assume 100g of the compound, so we have 83.72g C and 16.27g H. Converting to moles: Carbon is 83.72 / 12 ≈ 6.977 moles, Hydrogen is 16.27 / 1 ≈ 16.27 moles. The ratio is approximately 6.977 : 16.27. Dividing by the smaller number (6.977): C ≈ 1, H ≈ 2.33. To get whole numbers, multiply by 3: C3H7. But for an alkane, the formula should be CnH2n+2. Let's check if C3H8 is possible. Wait, C3H7 would be for an alkyl group, but the actual compound would need to be C3H8. But the ratio here is approximately C:H ≈ 1:2.33, which is close to 3:7. If the molecular formula is C6H14 (hexane), then the ratio would be 6:14, which simplifies to 3:7. So maybe the empirical formula is C3H7, but the actual molecular formula is C6H14. Let's check the molecular weight. If the molecular formula is C6H14, then the molecular weight is (6*12) + (14*1) = 72 +14=86 g/mol. The EI-MS for option A has a peak at m/z=86, which would be the molecular ion (M+). So that's promising. Also, the other peaks like 57, 43, 29 are common fragments for alkanes. For example, 57 could be C4H9+ (which is 4*12 +9=57), 43 is C3H7+ (3*12+7=43), and 29 could be C2H5+ (2*12+5=29). So option A seems plausible. Also, if the molecular formula is C6H14, then it's hexane. But for it to be optically active, it must have a chiral center. However, hexane is straight-chain and doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, but there are branched isomers of C6H14. For example, 3-methylpentane? Wait, no. Let me think. The isomers of C6H14 include 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, etc. Among these, which have chiral centers? A chiral center requires four different groups. Let's take 3-methylpentane. The central carbon (carbon 3) is connected to a methyl group, a pentyl group? Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. 3-methylpentane: the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, maybe better to think of 2-methylpentane. Wait, actually, for C6H14, the isomer with a chiral center would be 3-methylpentane. Let me check. The structure of 3-methylpentane is CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, pentane is five carbons. So 3-methylpentane would be CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of the structure. If the molecule is 2-methylpentane (which is actually 2-methylpentane, but I need to check if any of its carbons have four different groups). Alternatively, maybe 2,3-dimethylbutane. Let me consider that. 2,3-dimethylbutane: the central carbons (positions 2 and 3) each have two methyl groups. So no chiral centers there. How about 3-methylpentane? The structure would be CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. The central carbon (the one with the methyl branch) is connected to two CH2CH3 groups? No, maybe not. Wait, perhaps I need to look for an example. The isomer of C6H14 that is optically active is 3-methylpentane. Wait, no, actually, 3-methylpentane has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Wait, maybe another isomer. Let me think. The correct isomer is 2-methylpentane? No. Wait, actually, the correct optically active isomer of C6H14 is 3-methylpentane? Or maybe another one. Wait, perhaps 2-methylpentane. Let me check. The structure of 2-methylpentane is CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no. Wait, pentane is five carbons. 2-methylpentane would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The correct structure for an optically active C6H14 isomer is 3-methylpentane. Wait, but in 3-methylpentane, the central carbon is connected to two ethyl groups? No. Wait, let me try to draw it properly. The structure is CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, maybe not. Let me consider the carbon positions. If the main chain is pentane (5 carbons), and there's a methyl group on the third carbon, then the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2. Wait, that's not right. Wait, pentane is five carbons in a row. If there's a methyl group on the third carbon, the structure would be CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So the third carbon is connected to a methyl group, a CH2CH3 group (which is ethyl?), a CH2CH2 group? No, wait. Let me write it as:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: CH2-\n\nCarbon 3: CH(CH3)-\n\nCarbon 4: CH2-\n\nCarbon 5: CH3\n\nSo the structure is CH3CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. That's 3-methylpentane. Now, looking at the central carbon (the one with the methyl branch), it's connected to:\n\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n\n- A CH2CH3 group (which is ethyl)\n\n- Another CH2CH3 group (since the main chain is pentane, the carbon on the left side is CH2CH3 and the right side is CH2CH3?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, in this structure, the central carbon (carbon 3) is connected to:\n\n- One methyl group (from the branch)\n\n- Two CH2CH3 groups (since on the left side, it's connected to CH2CH3 (carbon 2) and on the right side, connected to CH2CH3 (carbon 4). So actually, the central carbon has two identical CH2CH3 groups. Therefore, it's not a chiral center because two substituents are the same. Therefore, 3-methylpentane is not chiral. Hmm, so maybe another isomer. Let's consider 2-methylpentane. The structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me think again. 2-methylpentane is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3. The central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:\n\n- A CH3 group (from the main chain carbon 1)\n\n- A CH2CH2CH2CH3 group (which is butyl?)\n\nWait, no. Let me write the structure properly. The main chain is pentane (five carbons), with a methyl branch on carbon 2. So:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: CH(CH2CH3)-\n\nCarbon 3: CH2-\n\nCarbon 4: CH2-\n\nCarbon 5: CH3\n\nSo the structure is CH3CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Now, looking at carbon 2: it's connected to:\n\n- A CH3 group (from carbon 1)\n\n- A CH2CH3 group (the branch)\n\n- A CH2CH2CH3 group (carbon 3 onwards). Wait, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (CH2), and the branch (CH2CH3). So the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- CH3 (from carbon 1)\n\n- CH2CH3 (the branch)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (from carbon 3 to 5)\n\nWait, but carbon 3 is CH2, so the substituent from carbon 2 to 3 is CH2CH2CH3? No, the substituent would be a CH2 group attached to the rest. So maybe the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- CH3 (from left)\n\n- CH2CH3 (the branch)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (from the right side)\n\nBut that would be three different groups. Wait, no. Wait, the carbon at position 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1: CH3-\n\n- Carbon 3: CH2-\n\n- The branch: CH2CH3\n\nSo the four groups attached to carbon 2 are:\n\n- CH3 (from carbon 1)\n\n- CH2CH3 (the branch)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (from carbon 3 to 5)\n\nWait, but actually, the substituents would be:\n\n- CH3 (from the left)\n\n- CH2CH3 (the branch)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (from the right)\n\n- And a hydrogen? Wait, no. Carbon 2 has four bonds. Let me count. Carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (CH3-)\n\n- Carbon 3 (CH2-)\n\n- The branch (CH2CH3)\n\n- And a hydrogen?\n\nWait, no. Carbon 2 in this structure has four bonds. Let me check again. The structure is CH3-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So carbon 2 has:\n\n- One bond to carbon 1 (CH3)\n\n- One bond to carbon 3 (CH2)\n\n- One bond to the branch (CH2CH3)\n\n- And one bond to a hydrogen?\n\nNo, wait. Carbon 2 has four bonds. The structure is CH3-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- CH3 (carbon 1)\n\n- CH2CH3 (branch)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (carbon 3 to 5)\n\nWait, no. Carbon 2 is connected to carbon 3, which is CH2. So the substituent on carbon 2 from the right side is a CH2 group. But since carbon 2 has four bonds, it's connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1: CH3-\n\n- Carbon 3: CH2-\n\n- The branch: CH2CH3\n\n- And one more bond. Wait, but carbon 2 is already connected to three groups. Where's the fourth? Oh, there's a hydrogen. So the four groups on carbon 2 are:\n\n- CH3 (from left)\n\n- CH2CH3 (branch)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (from right side, which is actually just CH2CH2CH3?)\n\nWait, but the substituent from the right side is a CH2 group connected to the rest. So maybe the four groups are:\n\n- CH3\n\n- CH2CH3\n\n- CH2CH2CH3\n\n- and a hydrogen?\n\nNo, that would be four different groups. Wait, but the hydrogen is a fourth group. So if carbon 2 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. Wait, but in reality, the substituent from the right side is a CH2CH2CH3, which is a propyl group. The substituent from the left is a methyl group. The branch is an ethyl group. And then there's a hydrogen. So yes, four different groups: methyl, ethyl, propyl, and hydrogen. Therefore, carbon 2 in 2-methylpentane is a chiral center. Therefore, 2-methylpentane is an optically active isomer of C6H14. So if option A corresponds to C6H14 (which it does, since molecular weight is 86, as calculated earlier), then option A could be the correct answer. But wait, the EI-MS data for option A has m/z=86 (M+), 57, 43, 29. The fragmentation pattern of alkanes typically involves losing methyl or ethyl groups. For example, C6H14 (hexane) would fragment into C4H9+ (57), C3H7+ (43), C2H5+ (29), etc. So that matches the EI-MS data given for option A. Therefore, option A is a possible candidate.\n\nNow, let's check the other options to see if any of them could be optically active.\n\nOption B: % composition C 82.75%, H 17.25%. Let's calculate the ratio. 82.75 / 12 ≈ 6.896 moles C, 17.25 /1 = 17.25 moles H. Ratio C:H ≈ 6.896 :17.25 ≈ 1 : 2.5. Multiply by 2 to get whole numbers: C2H5. The empirical formula is C2H5. But for an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2. Let's see if this ratio fits. For example, C2H5 would be for an alkyl group. The actual molecule would be C2H6 (ethane), which has a ratio of 2:6 = 1:3. But here, the ratio is 1:2.5, which is 2:5. So that doesn't fit the alkane formula. Maybe the molecular formula is C4H10? Let's check. C4H10 has a ratio of 4:10 = 2:5. Yes, that's 2:5. So the molecular formula would be C4H10 (butane). The molecular weight is 4*12 + 10= 48+10=58 g/mol. The EI-MS for option B has a peak at 58, which would be the molecular ion. The other peaks are 43, 27, 15. For butane (C4H10), the fragmentation would include C3H7+ (43), C2H5+ (29), and maybe CH3+ (15). But the given peaks are 43, 27, 15. Wait, 27 is not a typical fragment for butane. Maybe it's a different compound. Also, if the molecular formula is C4H10, then it's butane. But butane is not optically active because it's either straight-chain or branched (isobutane), but isobutane (2-methylpropane) has a central carbon with three methyl groups and one hydrogen, so no chiral center. Therefore, option B's compound is not optically active. So option B is out.\n\nOption C: % composition C 84%, H 16%. Let's calculate. 84 /12 =7 moles C, 16 /1 =16 moles H. Ratio C:H = 7:16. For an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2. Let's see if 7:16 fits. Let's solve 2n+2 = (16/7)*n. Wait, maybe better to find n such that H = 2n+2. Let's see. Let's suppose the molecular formula is C7H16. Then H/C ratio is 16/7 ≈ 2.285. Let's check if the given % composition matches. For C7H16, the percentage of carbon is (7*12)/(7*12 +16*1) *100 = 84/(84+16)=84/100=84%. Yes! So the % composition is exactly 84% C and 16% H, which matches option C. The molecular weight is 100 g/mol (7*12 +16=84+16=100). The EI-MS data for option C has m/z=100 (M+), 71, 57, 43. For heptane (C7H16), the fragmentation would include losing methyl or ethyl groups. For example, losing a methyl group (15) would give C6H13+ (which is 84-15=69?), wait. Alternatively, common fragments for alkanes: C5H11+ is 71 (5*12 +11=60+11=71). So 71 is a possible fragment. 57 is C4H9+ (57), 43 is C3H7+ (43). So the EI-MS data matches. Now, is heptane optically active? Well, straight-chain heptane is not. But there are branched isomers of C7H16. For example, 3-methylhexane. Let's check if any of the isomers have a chiral center. For example, 3-methylhexane: the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, let me think. The structure would be CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)... Wait, maybe better to consider specific isomers. For example, 2-methylhexane: the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to a methyl group, a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, a CH2CH2CH3 group, and a hydrogen? Wait, similar to the previous case. If there's a chiral center in one of the isomers, then it's possible. For example, 3-methylhexane. Let's imagine the structure: CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3. The central carbon (carbon 3) is connected to a methyl group, a CH2CH3 group, a CH2CH2CH3 group, and another CH2CH2CH3 group? No, maybe not. Wait, if the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3, then the central carbon (carbon 3) is connected to:\n\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n\n- A CH2CH3 group (from the branch)\n\n- Two CH2CH2CH3 groups (on either side). Wait, no. Let me write it properly. The main chain is hexane (six carbons), with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: CH2-\n\nCarbon 3: CH(CH2CH3)-\n\nCarbon 4: CH2-\n\nCarbon 5: CH2-\n\nCarbon 6: CH3\n\nSo the structure is CH3CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Now, looking at carbon 3 (the branched carbon), it is connected to:\n\n- A CH2CH3 group (from the branch)\n\n- Carbon 2 (CH2-)\n\n- Carbon 4 (CH2-)\n\n- And a hydrogen?\n\nWait, carbon 3 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 2 (CH2-)\n\n- Carbon 4 (CH2-)\n\n- The branch (CH2CH3)\n\n- And a hydrogen?\n\nSo the four substituents are:\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (from carbon 2 side)\n\nWait, no. Carbon 3 is connected to carbon 2 (which is CH2-), so the substituent from the left is a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. The substituent from the left (carbon 2) is a CH2 group attached to the rest of the chain. So the substituent is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Let me think again. The substituent from the left side (carbon 2) is a CH2 group attached to the rest of the chain, which is CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the four groups on carbon 3 are:\n\n- CH2CH3 (the branch)\n\n- CH2CH2CH2CH3 (from the left side)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (from the right side)\n\n- and a hydrogen?\n\nIf those are all different, then it's a chiral center. But I'm not sure. Let's consider specific substituents. The substituent from the left (carbon 2) is a CH2 group connected to the rest of the chain, which is CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, maybe it's better to name the substituents. The left side is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH2-), the right side is an ethyl group (CH2CH2-), and the branch is a methyl group (CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me try again. Carbon 3 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 2: which is CH2- attached to carbon 1 (CH3-), so the substituent from the left is a CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, carbon 3 is connected to carbon 2, which is CH2- attached to carbon 1 (CH3-). So the substituent from the left is CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. The substituent would be the entire chain on the left side of carbon 3. If the main chain is six carbons, and the branch is on carbon 3, then the left side of carbon 3 is two carbons (carbon 1 and 2), and the right side is three carbons (carbon 4,5,6). Wait, maybe not. Let me count:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: CH2-\n\nCarbon 3: CH(CH2CH3)-\n\nCarbon 4: CH2-\n\nCarbon 5: CH2-\n\nCarbon 6: CH3\n\nSo from carbon 3, the left side is carbon 2 (CH2-) connected to carbon 1 (CH3-), so the substituent from the left is a CH2CH3 group. The right side is carbon 4 (CH2-) connected to carbon 5 and 6 (CH2CH3), so the substituent from the right is a CH2CH2CH3 group. The branch is a CH2CH3 group. And there's a hydrogen. Wait, so the four substituents on carbon 3 are:\n\n- CH2CH3 (from the left)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (from the right)\n\n- CH2CH3 (from the branch)\n\n- and a hydrogen.\n\nBut two of them are CH2CH3 groups. Therefore, carbon 3 has two identical substituents, so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, this isomer is not optically active. Are there other isomers of C7H16 that have chiral centers? For example, 2,3-dimethylpentane. Let's consider that. The structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. In this case, the central carbons (positions 2 and 3) each have two methyl groups and a CH2 group, so no chiral centers. Another isomer: 3-methylhexane. Wait, we already considered that. How about 2-methylhexane? Let's take the structure CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, similar to the previous case. Carbon 2 has a methyl branch. The structure is CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3. Carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1: CH3-\n\n- Carbon 3: CH2-\n\n- The branch: CH2CH2CH3 (propyl)\n\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nSo the four groups are:\n\n- CH3 (from left)\n\n- CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (from right side)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (branch)\n\n- and hydrogen.\n\nThese four groups are all different, so carbon 2 is a chiral center. Therefore, 2-methylhexane (an isomer of C7H16) is optically active. Therefore, option C's compound (C7H16) could be an optically active isomer. However, the EI-MS data for option C has m/z=100 (M+), 71, 57, 43. For C7H16, the molecular ion is 100, and fragments like 71 (C5H11+), 57 (C4H9+), and 43 (C3H7+) are common. So the EI-MS data matches. Therefore, option C is also a candidate.\n\nNow, comparing options A and C. Both have molecular formulas that can be optically active isomers. How to decide between them?\n\nLet's check the other options first.\n\nOption D: % composition C 83.33%, H 16.66%. Let's calculate. 83.33 /12 ≈ 6.944 moles C, 16.66 /1 ≈ 16.66 moles H. Ratio C:H ≈ 6.944 :16.66 ≈ 1 : 2.4. Multiply by 3 to get whole numbers: C3H7.2. Hmm, not a whole number. Wait, maybe let's try to find the molecular formula. For an alkane, H = 2n+2. Let's suppose the formula is C6H14. For C6H14, the ratio is 6:14=3:7≈0.428. The given % composition is C 83.33% and H 16.66%. Let's check what the actual % would be for C6H14. Carbon percentage is (6*12)/(6*12 +14*1)*100 = 72/86*100 ≈ 83.72%. But option D says 83.33% C. Close but not exact. Alternatively, maybe C5H12. For C5H12, %C is (60/72)*100≈83.33%. Yes! 5*12=60, 5*12 +12*1=72. 60/72=0.8333. So the % composition is 83.33% C and 16.66% H. So the molecular formula is C5H12 (pentane). The molecular weight is 72 g/mol. The EI-MS for option D has m/z=72 (M+), 57, 43, 29. For pentane, the fragmentation would include C4H9+ (57), C3H7+ (43), C2H5+ (29). So the EI-MS data matches. Now, is pentane optically active? Straight-chain pentane is not. But there are branched isomers. For example, 2-methylbutane (isopentane). Does it have a chiral center? The structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me think. The structure of 2-methylbutane is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to two CH3 groups, a CH2CH3 group, and a hydrogen. So it has two identical methyl groups, so no chiral center. Another isomer: 3-methylbutane? No, that would be 2-methylbutane. How about 2,2-dimethylpropane? That's neopentane, which is highly symmetrical. No chiral centers. Therefore, none of the isomers of C5H12 are optically active. Therefore, option D is out.\n\nSo now, between options A and C. Both have molecular formulas that can be optically active isomers. Let's see if there are other clues. The EI-MS data for option A has m/z=86 (C6H14), and option C has m/z=100 (C7H16). The question is which one is optically active. Both could be, depending on the isomer. But the question asks which data set corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon. Since both A and C are possible, but the options are only one correct answer, perhaps there's another way to check.\n\nWait, the problem is from an exam, so maybe there's only one correct answer. Let me think again.\n\nFor option A: C6H14. The isomer with a chiral center is 2-methylpentane. Let me confirm that 2-methylpentane is indeed an isomer of hexane. Yes, 2-methylpentane is one of the isomers of hexane (C6H14). Therefore, if the compound is 2-methylpentane, it's optically active. The EI-MS data for option A includes 86 (M+), 57 (C4H9+), 43 (C3H7+), 29 (C2H5+). That's typical for hexane isomers.\n\nFor option C: C7H16. The isomer with a chiral center is 2-methylhexane. The EI-MS data includes 100 (M+), 71 (C5H11+), 57 (C4H9+), 43 (C3H7+). That's typical for heptane isomers.\n\nNow, the question is which of these options is correct. Since both are possible, but the options are A, B, C, D, and only one is correct, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's check the percentage composition again for option C. For C7H16, the %C is (7*12)/(7*12 +16*1) *100 = 84/100=84%, which matches option C's % composition of 84% C and 16% H. For option A, it's C 83.72% and H 16.27%, which is for C6H14 (72/86≈83.72%). So both are correct.\n\nBut the question is which one corresponds to an optically active compound. Since both A and C are possible, but the answer options only have one correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the isomers.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. Let's check the molecular ion (M+) in the EI-MS. For option A, M+ is 86 (C6H14), and for option C, M+ is 100 (C7H16). The question is whether the compound is optically active. Since both can be, but maybe the question expects the smallest possible molecule. However, both are possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a detail I missed.\n\nWait, let's check the EI-MS fragments again. For option A: 86, 57, 43, 29. These are common for alkanes. For option C: 100, 71, 57, 43. Also common. However, the question is about an optically active compound. Are there any other constraints?\n\nAnother approach: the molecular formula must have at least one chiral center. For a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane), the molecular formula must allow for a chiral center. Both C6H14 and C7H16 can have chiral centers. However, maybe the question is looking for the correct percentage composition and EI-MS data. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: C 83.72% and H 16.27% (C6H14, 86 g/mol), EI-MS peaks at 86, 57, 43, 29.\n\nOption C: C 84% and H 16% (C7H16, 100 g/mol), EI-MS peaks at 100, 71, 57, 43.\n\nNow, the EI-MS for option C includes 71, which is C5H11+ (5*12 +11=71). For option A, the EI-MS doesn't have 71, but has 29 (C2H5+).\n\nSince both options are possible, but the answer must be one of them, perhaps I need to look for another clue.\n\nWait, maybe the molecular formula. For an optically active alkane, the minimal number of carbons required is 7? No, 6 is sufficient (as in 2-methylpentane, C6H14). Therefore, both A and C are possible. But since the options are given, and the answer is likely one of them, perhaps there's an error in my previous analysis.\n\nWait, let me check the percentage composition again for option A. The given % composition is C 83.72% and H 16.27%. Let's calculate the molecular formula again. Assume 100g: 83.72g C and 16.27g H. Moles of C: 83.72 /12 ≈ 6.977, moles of H: 16.27 /1 ≈ 16.27. The ratio is approximately 6.977 :16.27 ≈ 1 : 2.33. Multiply by 3 to get 3:7. So empirical formula is C3H7. For an alkane, the molecular formula would be twice the empirical formula: C6H14. Yes, which is correct. So the molecular weight is 86, which matches the M+ at 86 in option A.\n\nFor option C, the empirical formula is C7H16, which is already the molecular formula. So both are correct.\n\nBut the question is which one is optically active. Since both can be, but the options are A, B, C, D, and the answer is likely one of them. Maybe the correct answer is A because it's a common example. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option C's isomer. Let me check if 2-methylhexane (C7H16) is indeed optically active. The structure is CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3. Carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- CH3 (from carbon 1)\n\n- CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (from carbon 3 to 6)\n\n- CH2CH2CH3 (the branch)\n\n- and a hydrogen.\n\nWait, no. Let me write the structure properly. The main chain is six carbons (hexane), with a methyl branch on carbon 2. Wait, no, C7H16's isomer with a methyl branch would be 2-methylhexane. The main chain is six carbons, and the branch is a methyl group on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. The main chain is six carbons: carbon 1 to 6. The branch is a methyl group on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's 2-methylhexane. Now, carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1: CH2-\n\n- Carbon 3: CH2-\n\n- The branch: CH3\n\n- and a hydrogen.\n\nWait, the four groups on carbon 2 are:\n\n- CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (from the left side, but actually, it's just a CH2 group attached to the rest)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think of the substituents. Carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- A CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 group (from the left side, but actually, since it's the main chain, it's a CH2 group attached to the rest of the chain)\n\nWait, no. Carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (CH2-)\n\n- Carbon 3 (CH2-)\n\n- The branch (CH3)\n\n- and a hydrogen.\n\nSo the four substituents are:\n\n- CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (from the left side, but actually, since the main chain is six carbons, the substituent from the left is a CH2 group attached to the rest of the chain, which is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's a pentyl group.\n\nWait, maybe I should name the substituents. The left side of carbon 2 is a CH2 group attached to the rest of the chain, which is a pentyl group (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3). The right side is a CH2 group attached to the rest of the chain, which is a butyl group (CH2CH2CH2CH3). The branch is a methyl group. And there's a hydrogen. So the four substituents are:\n\n- Pentyl (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)\n\n- Butyl (CH2CH2CH2CH3)\n\n- Methyl (CH3)\n\n- Hydrogen.\n\nThese are all different, so carbon 2 is a chiral center. Therefore, 2-methylhexane is optically active. Therefore, option C is also a valid answer.\n\nBut since the options are given, and both A and C are possible, but the answer must be one of them, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the correct answer based on the EI-MS data. Let me check the EI-MS data again.\n\nOption A's EI-MS has a peak at 29, which is C2H5+ (29). Option C's EI-MS has a peak at 71, which is C5H11+ (71). Both are possible.\n\nAnother approach: the molecular ion (M+) for option A is 86, which corresponds to C6H14 (hexane). The molecular ion for option C is 100, which is C7H16 (heptane). Now, the question is which of these is more likely to be optically active. Since both can be, but maybe the answer is A because it's a more common example. However, without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, let's check the percentage composition again for option A. The given % composition is C 83.72% and H 16.27%. For C6H14, the exact %C is (72/86)*100 ≈ 83.72%, which matches exactly. For option C, the % composition is exactly 84% and 16%, which matches C7H16. So both are exact.\n\nNow, the question is which one is optically active. Since both are possible, but the answer options only allow one, perhaps there's an error in my previous analysis. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with option C's EI-MS. Let's check. For C7H16, the EI-MS peaks include 100 (M+), 71 (C5H11+), 57 (C4H9+), 43 (C3H7+). These are typical fragments. For example, losing a C2H5 group (29) would give C5H11+ (71). Yes. So that's correct.\n\nBut why would the question have two possible answers? Maybe I missed something. Let me check the original question again. The question says \"optically active saturated hydrocarbon\". A saturated hydrocarbon is an alkane. Both C6H14 and C7H16 can have chiral centers. But maybe the correct answer is A because it's the only one with a molecular weight that allows a chiral center. Wait, no, both can.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the EI-MS data. For example, option C has a peak at 100, which is the molecular ion, but maybe the question is looking for a specific fragmentation pattern. However, both are valid.\n\nWait, another thought: the EI-MS for option C has a peak at 71, which is C5H11+. For C7H16, losing a C2H5 group (29) would give C5H11+ (71). For option A, the EI-MS has a peak at 29, which is C2H5+. So both are possible.\n\nSince I can't determine based on the given information, but in standard exams, usually, the smallest possible molecule is the answer. However, both are possible. But since the options are given and the answer must be one of them, perhaps the correct answer is A because it's a common example. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C. But I need to find a way to decide.\n\nWait, let's think about the number of isomers. For C6H14, there are 5 isomers. One of them is 2-methylpentane (optically active). For C7H16, there are 9 isomers, and several of them are optically active. But the question is about the data set, not the isomer itself. The data set provides the percentage composition and EI-MS. Both A and C have correct data for their respective molecular formulas. Since the question is from an exam, perhaps the intended answer is A. However, I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the percentage composition for option C. Let me recalculate for option C: %C is (7*12)/100 *100= 84%, which is correct. So no error there.\n\nWait, another angle: the question says \"optically active saturated hydrocarbon\". Saturated hydrocarbons are alkanes. For an alkane to be optically active, it must have at least one chiral center. The minimal number of carbons required for a chiral alkane is 7? No, as we've seen, C6H14 can have a chiral isomer. So both A and C are possible. However, perhaps the EI-MS data can help. For example, the peak at 71 in option C is specific to heptane, whereas option A's data is for hexane. But without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that both A and C are possible, but the options are presented as single-choice, I might have to consider which one is more likely. In standard chemistry problems, 2-methylpentane (C6H14) is a common example of an optically active alkane. Therefore, the answer is likely option A.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. However, given the options and the data provided, I'll go with option A as the correct answer.\n</think>"}
