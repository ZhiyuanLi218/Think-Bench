Hmm, let me start by recalling what current density is. Current density J is current per unit area, but more fundamentally, it's the amount of charge passing through a unit area per unit time. For a charged particle, like an electron in a conductor, when an electric field is applied, they experience a force and start to drift, which contributes to the current.\n\nBut wait, how exactly does the electric field relate to the current density? I remember something about drift velocity. The current density J can be expressed as J = n e v_d, where n is the number density of charge carriers, e is the charge of each carrier, and v_d is the drift velocity. Right, so if I can find the drift velocity in terms of the electric field, then I can express J in terms of E and get the conductivity σ from J = σ E.\n\nSo the next step is to find v_d in terms of E. In a conductor, electrons don't move freely; they collide with ions or other obstacles. These collisions cause them to lose energy and change direction. The average time between collisions is called the relaxation time τ. Wait, but the question mentions average relaxation time τ₀. Maybe that's the same thing?\n\nI think the model to use here is the Drude model. Let me recall. The Drude model treats electrons as classical particles undergoing acceleration due to the electric field but experiencing collisions that randomize their motion. The average time between collisions is τ. So the idea is that between collisions, electrons accelerate, but over time, the average velocity (drift velocity) is determined by the balance between acceleration from the electric field and the scattering events.\n\nLet me try to derive the drift velocity. The force on an electron in an electric field E is F = -e E (since electrons are negatively charged). The acceleration a is F/m = -e E / m. However, due to collisions, the electrons don't keep accelerating indefinitely. Instead, they have a mean free time τ between collisions. So the average drift velocity v_d would be the acceleration multiplied by the average time between collisions. So v_d = a τ = (-e E / m) τ. Therefore, J = n e v_d = n e (-e E / m) τ = - (n e² τ / m) E. \n\nBut conductivity σ is defined by J = σ E. Comparing the two equations, σ would be -n e² τ / m. But since conductivity is a positive quantity, maybe we take the magnitude? Or perhaps in the definition of J, the direction is already considered. Wait, actually, the current density J is a vector, and for a conductor with negative charge carriers (electrons), the current direction is opposite to the electron drift. However, the conductivity σ itself is a positive scalar quantity. So the formula would be σ = n e² τ / m. \n\nSo that seems to give the desired result. But let me check if I missed any factors. For example, in the Drude model, is the relaxation time τ the same as the average time between collisions? Or is there a factor of 1/2 or something? Let me think again. \n\nIn the Drude model derivation, the average drift velocity is obtained by considering the average time between collisions. The derivation starts from the equation of motion for the average velocity. The idea is that between collisions, electrons accelerate, and after each collision, their velocity is randomized. So the average velocity is determined by how much they accelerate during the average time between collisions. \n\nSo starting from Newton's law, considering the average velocity. The rate of change of the average velocity ⟨v⟩ is equal to the acceleration due to the electric field minus some term due to collisions. In the Drude model, it's often written as:\n\nm d⟨v⟩/dt = -e E - m ⟨v⟩ / τ\n\nThis is a differential equation where the second term on the right represents a frictional force that brings the velocity back to zero over a time τ. Solving this equation in steady state (when d⟨v⟩/dt = 0), we get:\n\n-e E = m ⟨v⟩ / τ ⇒ ⟨v⟩ = - (e E τ)/m\n\nWhich is the same as before. Therefore, J = n e ⟨v⟩ = - n e² τ E / m. \n\nBut again, since J is in the direction opposite to E for electrons, but if we consider the current density's magnitude, then σ is positive. Therefore, σ = n e² τ / m. \n\nBut the question mentions \"average relaxation time\" τ₀. So maybe τ₀ is the same as τ here. Therefore, the formula σ = n e² τ₀ / m is proven. \n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. For example, using the concept of mobility. The mobility μ is defined as μ = e τ / m. Then the drift velocity is v_d = μ E. Then current density J = n e μ E, so σ = n e μ = n e² τ / m. Same result. \n\nAlternatively, using kinetic theory. The current density can be derived from the distribution of velocities. In the absence of an electric field, the average velocity is zero. When an electric field is applied, the distribution gets a small drift velocity. The Drude model assumes that after each collision, the distribution is randomized, so the average velocity is determined by the acceleration during the time between collisions. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that the problem mentions a \"weak electric field\". Why is that? Because the Drude model assumes that the electric field is weak enough that the electrons don't gain too much energy between collisions, so that the acceleration can be treated linearly. If the field is too strong, the electrons might gain enough energy to cause non-linear effects, like increasing the collision frequency or other non-linear responses. But for weak fields, the linear relation J = σ E holds. \n\nTherefore, under the Drude model assumptions, with weak electric fields, the derivation holds and we get σ = n e² τ₀ / m. \n\nBut let me check units to make sure. Conductivity σ has units of ( Siemens per meter ) which is (C² s / (kg m³)) ? Let me check. \n\nn is number per volume (m⁻³), e is Coulombs, τ is seconds, m is kg. \n\nSo n e² τ / m has units (m⁻³)(C²)(s)/kg. Let me see what the units of conductivity are. Conductivity σ is (A/(V/m)) = (A m)/V. Since 1 A is C/s, 1 V is J/C = (kg m²)/(C s²). Therefore, σ has units (C/s * m) / (kg m² / (C s²)) ) = (C/s * m) * (C s² / (kg m²)) ) = (C² s) / (kg m). \n\nBut our expression n e² τ / m has units (m⁻³ * C² * s)/kg. Wait, that would be C² s/(kg m³). But according to the above, σ has units C² s/(kg m). There is a discrepancy here. Wait, did I do the unit analysis correctly?\n\nWait, let me recast. Conductivity σ is measured in siemens per meter (S/m). 1 S = 1 A/V. Therefore, σ has units (A/V)/m = A/(V m). But 1 A = 1 C/s, and 1 V = 1 J/C. Therefore, σ has units (C/s)/( (J/C) m ) = (C²)/(J m s). Since J is kg m²/s², substituting gives (C² s)/(kg m³). Wait, so σ has units of C² s/(kg m³). But according to our expression, n e² τ / m has units (m⁻³) * C² * s / kg = C² s/(kg m³). Which matches! Okay, so the units check out. Therefore, the formula is dimensionally correct. \n\nTherefore, the derivation seems correct. \n\nBut let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. \n\n1. Start with current density J = n e v_d.\n\n2. Determine v_d from the balance between electric force and scattering. \n\n3. In Drude model, electrons accelerate between collisions, with acceleration a = -e E / m.\n\n4. The average drift velocity is then v_d = a * τ = - e E τ / m.\n\n5. Substitute into J: J = -n e² τ / m * E.\n\n6. Since J = σ E, σ = n e² τ / m. \n\nYes, that seems correct. The negative sign indicates direction, but since conductivity is a scalar magnitude, we take the absolute value. \n\nTherefore, the conductivity σ is indeed given by σ = n e² τ₀ / m, where τ₀ is the average relaxation time. \n\nBut let me check if there's another factor in the derivation. For example, in some derivations, there is a factor of 1/2 or something else? For instance, in the kinetic theory, the average time between collisions is τ, but maybe the relaxation time in the Drude model is different? \n\nWait, in the Drude model, the relaxation time τ is the average time between collisions. The derivation of the current uses this τ directly. Therefore, τ₀ here is the same τ. \n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, relaxation time might refer to a different time constant, but in the Drude model, τ is indeed the average time between collisions. Therefore, the formula holds. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that the Drude model is a classical model and has limitations, but for the purpose of this question, it's probably acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, if we approach this from the Boltzmann transport equation, considering linear response theory, we might get the same result. But that's more complicated. Since the question seems to be at an introductory level, the Drude model approach is sufficient. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\nCurrent density J = n e v_d. \n\nDrift velocity v_d = - (e τ / m) E. \n\nTherefore, J = - (n e² τ / m) E. \n\nConductivity σ is positive, so σ = n e² τ / m. \n\nHence, proved. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just check if there is a standard textbook derivation that includes this. For example, in Ashcroft and Mermin's Solid State Physics, the Drude model is discussed, and they derive the conductivity as σ = n e² τ / m, where τ is the relaxation time. Therefore, this seems to be a standard result. \n\nTherefore, I think the proof is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe conductivity is \\boxed{\\sigma = \\frac{n e^2 \\bar{\\tau}_0}{m}}.\n</think>"}
