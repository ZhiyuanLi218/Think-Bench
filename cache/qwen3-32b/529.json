Hmm, let me start by recalling some complex number properties. \n\nFirst, let me denote $ z $ as a complex number. Since the imaginary part is 164, I can write $ z = a + 164i $, where $ a $ is a real number. That makes sense because any complex number can be expressed as $ \\text{Re}(z) + i\\text{Im}(z) $, and here the imaginary part is given as 164.\n\nSo, substituting $ z = a + 164i $ into the equation $ \\frac{z}{z + n} = 4i $. Let me write that out:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a + 164i}{a + 164i + n} = 4i\n$$\n\nSince $ n $ is a positive integer, adding it to $ z $ just affects the real part of the denominator. Let me simplify the denominator: $ a + n + 164i $.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a + 164i}{(a + n) + 164i} = 4i\n$$\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for $ a $ and $ n $. Since $ n $ is a positive integer, and $ a $ is a real number, I need to find such $ a $ and $ n $ that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet me cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:\n\n$$\na + 164i = 4i \\cdot \\left( (a + n) + 164i \\right)\n$$\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side. Multiplying $ 4i $ by each term inside the parentheses:\n\nFirst, $ 4i \\times (a + n) = 4(a + n)i $, and $ 4i \\times 164i = 656i^2 $. Remembering that $ i^2 = -1 $, so the second term becomes $ 656(-1) = -656 $.\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side simplifies to:\n\n$$\n4(a + n)i - 656\n$$\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n$$\na + 164i = -656 + 4(a + n)i\n$$\n\nNow, let me write both sides in terms of their real and imaginary parts. The left-hand side has real part $ a $ and imaginary part 164. The right-hand side has real part $ -656 $ and imaginary part $ 4(a + n) $.\n\nSince two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal, I can set up two equations:\n\n1. Real parts: $ a = -656 $\n2. Imaginary parts: $ 164 = 4(a + n) $\n\nOkay, so from the first equation, I immediately get $ a = -656 $. Let me plug this into the second equation to find $ n $.\n\nSubstituting $ a = -656 $ into the second equation:\n\n$$\n164 = 4(-656 + n)\n$$\n\nLet me solve for $ n $:\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 4:\n\n$$\n\\frac{164}{4} = -656 + n\n$$\n\nCalculating $ 164 / 4 $:\n\nWell, 4 × 40 = 160, so 164 - 160 = 4, so 40 + 1 = 41. Therefore, 164 / 4 = 41.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n41 = -656 + n\n$$\n\nSolving for $ n $:\n\nAdd 656 to both sides:\n\n$$\nn = 41 + 656\n$$\n\nCalculating 41 + 656:\n\nWell, 656 + 40 = 696, then +1 = 697. So, n = 697.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify.\n\nStarting with:\n\nOriginal equation: $ \\frac{z}{z + n} = 4i $, with Im(z) = 164. Let me check if plugging back z = -656 + 164i and n = 697 satisfies the equation.\n\nCompute z + n: z + n = (-656 + 164i) + 697 = (697 - 656) + 164i = 41 + 164i.\n\nSo z/(z + n) is (-656 + 164i)/(41 + 164i). Let me compute this.\n\nFirst, maybe rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 41 + 164i is 41 - 164i.\n\nSo:\n\nNumerator: (-656 + 164i)(41 - 164i)\n\nDenominator: (41 + 164i)(41 - 164i)\n\nLet me compute denominator first:\n\nDenominator: 41² - (164i)². Wait, but since we are multiplying (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². However, note that b here is 164i, so b² is (164i)^2. Let me compute:\n\nBut actually, since we are dealing with complex numbers, the formula is still (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² + b². Wait, because (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² - (bi)^2 = a² - b²i² = a² - b²(-1) = a² + b². Therefore, in this case, denominator is 41² + 164².\n\nBut let me compute that. However, maybe I don't need to compute the actual value. Let me check if z/(z + n) equals 4i.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let me recall that earlier we had:\n\nFrom the equation, we found z = -656 + 164i and z + n = 41 + 164i. Let me compute the ratio.\n\nSo z / (z + n) = [ -656 + 164i ] / [ 41 + 164i ]\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator. Let me see if there's a common factor. Let me note that 164 is 4 × 41. Wait, 4 × 41 is 164. So 164i = 4×41 i. Also, 41 is in the denominator's real part.\n\nLet me write numerator:\n\n-656 + 164i. Let me note that 656 divided by 41 is... Let me compute 41 × 16 = 656. Yes! 41 × 16 = 656. Therefore, -656 = -41 × 16. And 164i = 4 × 41 i. Therefore, numerator can be written as:\n\n-41 × 16 + 4 × 41 i = 41(-16 + 4i)\n\nSimilarly, the denominator is 41 + 164i = 41(1) + 4×41 i = 41(1 + 4i)\n\nTherefore, z/(z + n) = [41(-16 + 4i)] / [41(1 + 4i)] = (-16 + 4i)/(1 + 4i)\n\nThe 41 cancels out. Now compute (-16 + 4i)/(1 + 4i). Let me multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 1 - 4i:\n\nNumerator: (-16 + 4i)(1 - 4i)\n\nDenominator: (1 + 4i)(1 - 4i) = 1² + 4² = 1 + 16 = 17\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst, expand (-16)(1) + (-16)(-4i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-4i)\n\n= -16 + 64i + 4i - 16i²\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-16 + (64i + 4i) -16i²\n\n= -16 + 68i -16(-1) [since i² = -1]\n\n= -16 + 68i + 16\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-16 + 16) + 68i = 0 + 68i = 68i\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 68i / 17 = 4i. Which matches the original equation. Perfect! So the calculation checks out. Therefore, n = 697 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nBut let me recap the steps once more to make sure I didn't skip anything. \n\nStarting with z = a + 164i. Then setting up the equation z/(z + n) = 4i. Cross-multiplied to get z = 4i(z + n). Then expanded, separated real and imaginary parts, solved for a and n. Got a = -656, then substituted into the equation for the imaginary parts and found n = 697. Then verified by plugging back in, and it worked. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 697. But let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem, just to make sure there isn't an alternative solution or if I missed a possible case.\n\nAlternatively, suppose someone decides to let z = x + 164i, and then write the equation as z = 4i(z + n). Then:\n\nz = 4i z + 4i n\n\nBring terms with z to one side:\n\nz - 4i z = 4i n\n\nz(1 - 4i) = 4i n\n\nTherefore, z = [4i n]/[1 - 4i]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 1 + 4i:\n\nz = [4i n (1 + 4i)] / [(1 - 4i)(1 + 4i)] = [4i n (1 + 4i)] / (1 + 16) = [4i n (1 + 4i)] / 17\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n4i n (1 + 4i) = 4i n + 16i² n = 4i n - 16n (since i² = -1)\n\nTherefore, z = (-16n + 4i n)/17 = (-16n/17) + (4n/17)i\n\nBut we know that the imaginary part of z is 164, so:\n\nIm(z) = 4n / 17 = 164\n\nTherefore, solving for n:\n\n4n = 164 × 17\n\nn = (164 × 17)/4\n\nSimplify 164 divided by 4 is 41, so:\n\nn = 41 × 17\n\nCompute 41 × 17:\n\nWell, 40 × 17 = 680, and 1 × 17 = 17, so total is 680 + 17 = 697. Same result. So this alternative method also gives n = 697, which confirms the answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, n is 697. Thus, the answer is 697.\n\nBut just to check once more, let me compute 4n / 17 = 164. If n = 697, then 4 × 697 / 17. Let me compute 697 divided by 17 first. 17 × 41 is 697, because 17 × 40 = 680, plus 17 = 697. Therefore, 697 / 17 = 41. Then 4 × 41 = 164. Perfect, that's exactly the imaginary part. And the real part is -16n / 17 = -16 × 41 = -656, which matches the earlier result. Therefore, z = -656 + 164i, and n = 697. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 697. Seems solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So I think that's the correct value of n.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ n $ is \\boxed{697}.\n</think>"}
