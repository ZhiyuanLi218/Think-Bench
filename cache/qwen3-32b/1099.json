The question is asking which is the most massive subatomic particle among the options given: proton, neutron, alpha particle, or beta particle. Hmm, I need to remember the masses of these particles.\n\nFirst, I know that protons and neutrons are both found in the nucleus of an atom. They have similar masses, right? I think the mass of a proton is about 1 atomic mass unit (amu), and the neutron is slightly heavier, maybe around 1.008 amu. But I'm not 100% sure if that's correct. Wait, actually, I recall that the neutron is a bit heavier than the proton, but the difference is small. So between A and B, the neutron is more massive than the proton. So if the options were just A and B, B would be the answer. But there are also C and D options: alpha and beta particles.\n\nAn alpha particle is a helium nucleus, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. So if each proton and neutron is about 1 amu, then an alpha particle would have a mass of 4 amu. That's definitely more than a single proton or neutron. So an alpha particle is heavier than both A and B. \n\nThen there's the beta particle. A beta particle is an electron or a positron emitted during radioactive decay. Electrons are much lighter than protons or neutrons. The mass of an electron is about 1/1836 of a proton's mass. So a beta particle is way lighter than the others. \n\nSo putting it all together: alpha particle (4 amu) is heavier than neutron (about 1 amu) and proton (about 1 amu), and beta particle is the lightest. Therefore, the most massive subatomic particle among the options is the alpha particle, which is option C. \n\nWait, but the question says \"subatomic particle.\" Is an alpha particle considered a subatomic particle? Because it's a nucleus, but it's made up of protons and neutrons. So maybe the term here is a bit tricky. However, in the context of the options given, the other choices are individual particles or particles emitted in decay. Since the alpha particle is a composite particle (but still subatomic), and it's more massive than the others, the answer should be C.\n</think>"}
