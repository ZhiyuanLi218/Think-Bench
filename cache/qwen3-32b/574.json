Let the side length of $ABCD$ be $S$, so its area is $S^2 = 2016$. We can parameterize square $IJKL$ by choosing a parameter $t$ such that:\n\n- The vertices of $IJKL$ lie on the sides of $ABCD$ at coordinates:\n  $$\n  (t, S/2), (S/2, -t), (-t, -S/2), (-S/2, t)\n  $$\n- The area of $IJKL$ is:\n  $$\n  A_{IJKL} = S^2/2 + 2t^2 = 1008 + 2t^2\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Area of Square EFGH\n\nWe are told that square $EFGH$ is axis-aligned and centered, and each of its vertices lies on a side of $IJKL$. The area of $EFGH$ is related to $t$ as:\n$$\nA_{EFGH} = \\left( \\frac{2(a^2 + t^2)}{a + t} \\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $a = S/2 = \\sqrt{504}$, since $S^2 = 2016$.\n\nSubstituting $a^2 = 504$, we get:\n$$\nA_{EFGH} = 2016 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1 + x^2}{1 + x} \\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $x = t/a$, and $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nLet’s define:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1 + x^2}{1 + x}\n\\quad \\text{so that} \\quad A_{EFGH} = 2016 \\cdot r^2\n$$\n\nWe are told that $A_{EFGH}$ must be an integer less than 2016.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.\n\nWe have two squares, ABCD and EFGH, with a common center. The sides AB and EF are parallel. The area of ABCD is 2016, and the area of EFGH is a smaller positive integer. Then, there's another square IJKL constructed such that each of its vertices lies on a side of ABCD, and each vertex of EFGH lies on a side of IJKL. We need to find the difference between the largest and smallest positive integer values for the area of IJKH.\n\nAlright, so the problem is about squares with the same center, aligned so that their sides are parallel. Then there's a third square sandwiched between them. The key here is probably understanding the relationship between the areas of these squares.\n\nFirst, since all squares have the same center and their sides are parallel, their positions are related by scaling and rotation. But since AB is parallel to EF, there's no rotation involved between ABCD and EFGH. So EFGH is just a smaller square centered at the same center as ABCD, scaled down.\n\nNow, square IJKL is constructed such that each vertex is on a side of ABCD. So IJKL is inscribed in ABCD. But also, each vertex of EFGH lies on a side of IJKL. So EFGH is inscribed in IJKL. Therefore, IJKL is sandwiched between ABCD and EFGH. So we need to find possible areas of IJKL such that EFGH fits inside IJKL, and IJKL fits inside ABCD. And since EFGH has an integer area smaller than 2016, we need to find the possible integer areas for IJKL and then find the difference between the largest and smallest possible ones.\n\nFirst, maybe I should recall some properties about squares inscribed in squares. If you have a square inscribed in another square with sides parallel, the inscribed square can be rotated or aligned. But in this case, since all squares are aligned (AB || EF), IJKL must also be aligned with ABCD and EFGH? Wait, but if IJKL is inscribed in ABCD with each vertex on a side, there are different possibilities. For example, if you have a square rotated 45 degrees inside another square, but in that case, the sides aren't parallel. However, if they are aligned, then the inscribed square would have sides parallel, but how?\n\nWait, if you have a square inscribed in another square with sides parallel, then it's just a smaller square centered inside. But if each vertex lies on a side of ABCD, then maybe it's similar to the case where each vertex is at the midpoint? But that would be a square rotated 45 degrees. Wait, confusion here.\n\nWait, maybe there are two different ways to inscribe a square in another square: one rotated and one axis-aligned. If it's axis-aligned, then it's just a smaller square centered inside. However, in that case, each side of the inner square would lie on the sides of the outer square? No, if they are axis-aligned, the inner square's sides would be parallel and centered, but the vertices of the inner square would lie along the sides of the outer square only if the inner square is scaled appropriately.\n\nLet me visualize. Suppose ABCD is a square. If I want to inscribe another square IJKL with sides parallel to ABCD, such that each vertex of IJKL is on a side of ABCD. Let me think of coordinates.\n\nLet me place square ABCD on a coordinate system with center at the origin. Let’s assume ABCD has side length S, so coordinates would be from (-S/2, -S/2) to (S/2, S/2). If IJKL is a square inside ABCD, with sides parallel, then let me denote the side length of IJKL as s. If it's centered at the origin, then its coordinates would be from (-s/2, -s/2) to (s/2, s/2). However, in this case, the vertices of IJKL are at the centers of the sides of ABCD only if s is smaller? Wait, no. If IJKL is centered and axis-aligned, then its vertices are just points along the sides of ABCD if it's scaled appropriately. Wait, for example, if the inner square is smaller, then its vertices would lie inside the sides of ABCD. But how?\n\nWait, let's think of it this way. Suppose ABCD is a square with side length S, centered at the origin. Let me parameterize the inner square IJKL. Let me suppose that each vertex of IJKL lies on a side of ABCD. Let me consider one vertex of IJKL on side AB of ABCD. Let me parametrize where it is. Let me think of coordinates again.\n\nLet’s assume ABCD has coordinates: A(-a, a), B(a, a), C(a, -a), D(-a, -a). Wait, if the square is centered at the origin with sides aligned with axes, then if the side length is 2a, then coordinates would be from -a to a. But the area of ABCD is 2016, so if the side length is 2a, then area is (2a)^2 = 4a² = 2016. Therefore, a² = 504, so a = sqrt(504). But maybe I can just work with variables for now.\n\nLet me think. Suppose square IJKL is inside ABCD, with sides parallel, each vertex on a side of ABCD. Let me consider one vertex on AB, one on BC, one on CD, and one on DA. Let me suppose that each vertex is at some distance from the corner.\n\nLet me parameterize the position of the vertices. Let me suppose that on side AB, which goes from (-a, a) to (a, a), the vertex of IJKL is at (t, a), where t is between -a and a. Similarly, on side BC, which goes from (a, a) to (a, -a), the vertex is at (a, -t). On side CD, (-t, -a), and on side DA, (-a, t). Then connecting these points would form a square. Let me check.\n\nSo if we connect (t, a), (a, -t), (-t, -a), (-a, t), then connecting these points would form a square. Let me verify.\n\nFirst, let's compute the distance between (t, a) and (a, -t). The distance squared is (a - t)^2 + (-t - a)^2 = (a - t)^2 + (-a - t)^2 = (a² - 2at + t²) + (a² + 2at + t²) = 2a² + 2t². Similarly, the distance between (a, -t) and (-t, -a) is (-t - a)^2 + (-a + t)^2 = same as above, so same distance. Therefore, all sides are equal. Also, the slopes of the sides can be checked for perpendicularity.\n\nSlope between (t, a) and (a, -t): ( -t - a ) / (a - t ) = (- (a + t)) / (a - t)\n\nSlope between (a, -t) and (-t, -a): (-a + t)/(-t - a) = (t - a)/(- (a + t)) = (a - t)/(a + t)\n\nMultiplying the two slopes: [ - (a + t)/(a - t) ] * [ (a - t)/(a + t) ) ] = -1. Therefore, the sides are perpendicular. Therefore, this is indeed a square. Therefore, the square IJKL with vertices at (t, a), (a, -t), (-t, -a), (-a, t) is a square inscribed in ABCD with sides parallel? Wait, no. Wait, if we connect those points, the sides of IJKL are not parallel to ABCD. Wait, the slope between (t, a) and (a, -t) is not horizontal or vertical. Therefore, even though the square is inscribed with vertices on the sides of ABCD, it's actually rotated. Therefore, my initial thought was wrong. So even though the problem says that square IJKL is constructed so that each of its vertices lies on a side of ABCD, and each vertex of EFGH lies on a side of IJKL. But if IJKL is rotated, then EFGH, which is axis-aligned, would have vertices lying on the sides of IJKL. But since EFGH is axis-aligned and IJKL is rotated, this seems possible.\n\nBut maybe there is another way to inscribe IJKL with sides parallel to ABCD? For example, if IJKL is axis-aligned, then each vertex would lie on the sides of ABCD only if it's scaled down. Let me think. Suppose IJKL is axis-aligned, centered at the origin, with side length s. Then its vertices are at (s/2, s/2), etc. These points must lie on the sides of ABCD. The sides of ABCD are at x = ±a, y = ±a. Therefore, for the vertex (s/2, s/2) to lie on the side of ABCD, it must be that either x = a or y = a. But since (s/2, s/2) is inside ABCD, unless s = 2a, which is the same as ABCD. Therefore, if IJKL is axis-aligned and smaller, its vertices are inside ABCD, not on the sides. Therefore, if we want each vertex of IJKL to lie on a side of ABCD, then IJKL must be rotated. Therefore, the square IJKL is rotated 45 degrees relative to ABCD? Or some other angle?\n\nWait, but in the previous example, with vertices at (t, a), (a, -t), etc., that square is rotated by 45 degrees only when t = 0? No, actually, when t = 0, the square would have vertices at (0, a), (a, 0), (0, -a), (-a, 0), which is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at midpoints of the sides of ABCD if a is half the side length. Wait, in that case, if ABCD has side length 2a, then the rotated square inside has vertices at midpoints, and its side length can be calculated.\n\nBut in general, for any t, the square IJKL is rotated and has different side lengths. Therefore, in our problem, since EFGH is axis-aligned, and it's inscribed in IJKL, which is rotated. Therefore, EFGH's vertices lie on the sides of IJKL.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the relationship between the areas of ABCD, IJKL, and EFGH.\n\nGiven that ABCD has area 2016, EFGH has a smaller integer area, and IJKL is sandwiched between them. The problem asks for the difference between the largest and smallest possible integer areas of IJKL.\n\nSo perhaps we need to find the possible areas of IJKL given that it can contain EFGH inside it, with EFGH axis-aligned and centered.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s let ABCD have side length S, so area S² = 2016. Therefore, S = sqrt(2016). Let me compute that. 2016 factors: 2016 = 16 * 126 = 16 * 9 * 14 = 16 * 9 * 2 * 7, so sqrt(2016) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(14) = 12√14. But maybe I don't need the exact value.\n\nLet me consider coordinates again. Let me place ABCD with center at origin, sides aligned with axes, side length S. Then coordinates of ABCD are from (-S/2, -S/2) to (S/2, S/2). Then square IJKL is the square with vertices at (t, S/2), (S/2, -t), (-t, -S/2), (-S/2, t) for some t between 0 and S/2. Wait, earlier I used a different parameterization, but here, if we take t as the coordinate along the side, then yes. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, if we take t between -S/2 and S/2, but since of symmetry, we can assume t is positive and between 0 and S/2.\n\nEarlier, we saw that this square IJKL has side length squared equal to 2*( (S/2 - t)^2 + (S/2 + t)^2 )? Wait, no. Wait, earlier calculation said that the squared distance between (t, S/2) and (S/2, -t) is (S/2 - t)^2 + (-t - S/2)^2 = (S/2 - t)^2 + (-S/2 - t)^2 = same as before. Which is:\n\nFirst term: (S/2 - t)^2 = (S²/4 - S t + t²)\n\nSecond term: (-S/2 - t)^2 = (S²/4 + S t + t²)\n\nAdding them together: S²/4 - S t + t² + S²/4 + S t + t² = S²/2 + 2 t².\n\nTherefore, the distance squared between two adjacent vertices is S²/2 + 2 t². Therefore, the side length of IJKL is sqrt(S²/2 + 2 t²). Wait, but that seems odd. Wait, no, because in reality, the distance between (t, S/2) and (S/2, -t) is the length of the side of the square? Wait, no, because those two points are adjacent vertices?\n\nWait, no, in the square IJKL, the vertices are (t, S/2), (S/2, -t), (-t, -S/2), (-S/2, t). Connecting these points in order would make a square. Let me check the distance between (t, S/2) and (S/2, -t): yes, that is one side. Then between (S/2, -t) and (-t, -S/2): another side, etc. So each side has the same length sqrt(S²/2 + 2 t²). Wait, but that formula seems to suggest that as t increases, the side length of IJKL increases. When t = 0, the side length is sqrt(S²/2) = S / sqrt(2), which is the square rotated 45 degrees inside ABCD, with vertices at the midpoints of ABCD's sides. When t approaches S/2, the side length approaches sqrt(S²/2 + 2*(S²/4)) = sqrt(S²/2 + S²/2) = sqrt(S²) = S, which is the original square ABCD. Therefore, this parameter t controls the size of IJKL between the rotated square and ABCD itself.\n\nTherefore, the area of IJKL is [sqrt(S²/2 + 2 t²)]² = S²/2 + 2 t². Therefore, Area(IJKL) = (S²)/2 + 2 t². Since S² is 2016, Area(IJKL) = 2016/2 + 2 t² = 1008 + 2 t². Therefore, t can range from 0 to S/2, so t² ranges from 0 to S² / 4 = 2016 / 4 = 504. Therefore, Area(IJKL) ranges from 1008 + 0 = 1008 up to 1008 + 2*(504) = 1008 + 1008 = 2016. Which makes sense, because when t = 0, it's the rotated square with half the area? Wait, no. Wait, when t = 0, Area(IJKL) is 1008, which is half of 2016. But a square rotated 45 degrees inside another square has half the area? Let me check with a unit square. Suppose ABCD is a unit square. Then the rotated square with vertices at midpoints would have side length sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2), so area is (sqrt(1/2))² = 1/2. Yes, exactly. Therefore, that formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the area of IJKL can be any value between 1008 and 2016, depending on t. However, we have another condition: square EFGH is inside IJKL, with each of its vertices on a side of IJKL. And EFGH is axis-aligned, with area smaller than 2016. Therefore, we need to find the possible areas of IJKL such that there exists an axis-aligned square EFGH inside IJKL, with integer area.\n\nTherefore, we need to relate the area of EFGH to the area of IJKL.\n\nSo let's think about how an axis-aligned square EFGH can be inscribed in a rotated square IJKL.\n\nWait, but IJKL is rotated relative to EFGH? Wait, no. Wait, EFGH is axis-aligned, same as ABCD, and IJKL is rotated. Therefore, EFGH is inside IJKL, axis-aligned. Therefore, we need to find the maximum possible axis-aligned square that can fit inside IJKL. Since EFGH has to be smaller than ABCD, but since IJKL is between ABCD and the rotated square, maybe EFGH is determined by the dimensions of IJKL.\n\nSo given a square IJKL, which is rotated, what is the maximum area axis-aligned square that can fit inside it?\n\nAlternatively, given that EFGH is axis-aligned and inscribed in IJKL, what is the relation between their areas?\n\nAlternatively, since EFGH is axis-aligned and centered, same as IJKL. Let me try to model this.\n\nFirst, let me consider square IJKL, which is rotated. Let me try to find the maximum axis-aligned square that can fit inside IJKL. The area of such square would be related to the dimensions of IJKL.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the coordinates of IJKL, perhaps we can find the coordinates of EFGH.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for the largest axis-aligned square inside a rotated square.\n\nAlternatively, since we have parameterized IJKL in terms of t, perhaps we can find the relation between t and the area of EFGH.\n\nLet me try to proceed with coordinates.\n\nGiven square IJKL with vertices at (t, S/2), (S/2, -t), (-t, -S/2), (-S/2, t). Let me find the equations of the sides of IJKL.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the side between (t, S/2) and (S/2, -t). The slope of this side is (-t - S/2)/(S/2 - t) = (- (t + S/2)) / (S/2 - t) = let's rationalize. Let me write it as [ - (t + a) ] / (a - t) where a = S/2. Which is equal to - (a + t)/ (a - t). Therefore, slope m1 = - (a + t)/(a - t).\n\nSimilarly, the equation of this line can be written using point-slope form. Let me take the point (t, a) where a = S/2.\n\nSo equation is y - a = m1 (x - t). Similarly for other sides.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Since IJKL is a square, maybe we can find the boundaries for an axis-aligned square inside it.\n\nAlternatively, since EFGH is axis-aligned and centered, let's denote its side length as s, so area s². We need to find s in terms of t, then relate s² to the area of IJKL.\n\nSince EFGH is centered and axis-aligned, its sides are horizontal and vertical. Let me imagine EFGH inside IJKL. The maximum axis-aligned square that can fit inside IJKL would depend on how much space IJKL allows in the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nAlternatively, since IJKL is a rotated square, the maximum axis-aligned square inside it would be determined by the intersection points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the distance from the center to the sides of IJKL along the axes.\n\nSince EFGH is axis-aligned, its sides are horizontal and vertical. For EFGH to fit inside IJKL, the horizontal and vertical distances from the center to the sides of IJKL must be at least half the side length of EFGH.\n\nTherefore, if we can find the horizontal and vertical \"reach\" of IJKL, then the maximum possible EFGH would have half-side length equal to the minimum of horizontal and vertical reach.\n\nBut since IJKL is symmetric, the horizontal and vertical reach should be the same? Wait, no. Wait, IJKL is a square rotated by some angle, so depending on the rotation, the horizontal and vertical reach could differ. Wait, but in our case, the square IJKL is symmetric with respect to both axes, because of the way it's constructed (vertices at (t, a), etc.). Therefore, the horizontal and vertical reach should be the same.\n\nTherefore, the maximum axis-aligned square EFGH that fits inside IJKL would have its sides touching IJKL at points along the horizontal and vertical axes.\n\nLet me try to compute the horizontal reach of IJKL. That is, the maximum x-coordinate of IJKL along the horizontal axis. Since IJKL is a square, symmetric about the origin, its horizontal reach would be the maximum x-value it attains. Looking at the vertices of IJKL: (t, a), (a, -t), (-t, -a), (-a, t). The maximum x-coordinate among these is a (from the point (a, -t)), and similarly the minimum x-coordinate is -a. However, the sides of IJKL might extend beyond those vertices? Wait, no. Wait, the square IJKL has those four vertices. Wait, but when you connect them, the sides are between those vertices, so the square is actually a diamond shape relative to ABCD? Wait, no. Wait, if you connect (t, a) to (a, -t), then that side crosses the horizontal axis somewhere. Let me find where the sides of IJKL intersect the horizontal and vertical axes.\n\nLet me find the intersection of the side between (t, a) and (a, -t) with the x-axis (y=0). Let me parametrize this line.\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx = t + (a - t)*k\n\ny = a + (-t - a)*k, where k ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSet y = 0:\n\na - (a + t)k = 0 => k = a / (a + t)\n\nTherefore, x = t + (a - t)*(a / (a + t)) = t + [a(a - t)] / (a + t) = [ t(a + t) + a(a - t) ] / (a + t ) = [ ta + t² + a² - at ] / (a + t ) = (a² + t²) / (a + t )\n\nTherefore, the intersection point with the x-axis is at ( (a² + t²)/(a + t), 0 )\n\nSimilarly, the intersection with the y-axis can be found by setting x=0. Let me do that for another side. Let's take the side between (a, -t) and (-t, -a). Let me find where this side crosses the y-axis (x=0).\n\nParametric equations for this side:\n\nx = a + (-t - a)*k\n\ny = -t + (-a + t)*k, where k from 0 to 1.\n\nSet x=0:\n\na - (a + t)k = 0 => k = a / (a + t)\n\nTherefore, y = -t + (-a + t)*(a / (a + t)) = -t + [ -a(a) + a t ] / (a + t ) = -t + [ -a² + a t ] / (a + t )\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= [ -t(a + t) - a² + a t ] / (a + t ) = [ -a t - t² - a² + a t ] / (a + t ) = ( - t² - a² ) / (a + t ) = - (a² + t² ) / (a + t )\n\nTherefore, the intersection with the y-axis is at (0, - (a² + t² ) / (a + t ) )\n\nTherefore, similarly, the intersection points with the axes are symmetric. Therefore, the horizontal reach of IJKL is (a² + t² ) / (a + t ), and similarly for vertical reach. Therefore, since EFGH is axis-aligned and centered, its half-side length must be less than or equal to this value. Therefore, if EFGH has half-side length m, then m = (a² + t² ) / (a + t ). Therefore, the side length of EFGH is 2m = 2(a² + t² ) / (a + t ), and area is [2(a² + t² ) / (a + t )]^2.\n\nBut we need EFGH to be inscribed in IJKL, meaning that its vertices lie on the sides of IJKL. However, if EFGH is the maximal axis-aligned square inside IJKL, then its vertices would lie on the sides of IJKL. Therefore, in this case, the area of EFGH is [2(a² + t² ) / (a + t )]^2.\n\nBut in our problem, EFGH is given to have integer area, smaller than 2016. Therefore, given that ABCD has area S² = 2016, where S = 2a (since earlier we considered ABCD with coordinates from -a to a, so side length 2a). Therefore, S² = (2a)^2 = 4a² = 2016 => a² = 504. Therefore, a = sqrt(504). Therefore, substituting back, the area of EFGH is [ 2(a² + t² ) / (a + t ) ]².\n\nLet me compute that expression. Let me denote A = area of EFGH.\n\nA = [ 2(a² + t² ) / (a + t ) ]².\n\nBut we also know that the area of IJKL is 1008 + 2t², as established earlier.\n\nOur goal is to relate A and the area of IJKL. But since we need A to be an integer, and we need to find possible areas of IJKL such that A is integer and smaller than 2016.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to find the possible areas of IJKL given that A is integer, we need to find t such that A is integer, and then find the corresponding area of IJKL.\n\nBut since the problem says that EFGH has a smaller positive integer area, and we need to find the difference between the largest and smallest possible integer areas of IJKL. Therefore, we need to find all possible integer values of A (area of EFGH) such that there exists t where A = [ 2(a² + t² ) / (a + t ) ]², and then for each such A, compute the corresponding area of IJKL = 1008 + 2t², then find the min and max of those areas and take their difference.\n\nBut since a² = 504, let me substitute that into the expression for A.\n\nA = [ 2(504 + t² ) / (sqrt(504) + t ) ]².\n\nWait, but this seems complicated because of the square roots. Maybe we can simplify the expression 2(a² + t²)/(a + t).\n\nLet me compute 2(a² + t²)/(a + t). Let me note that a² + t² = (a + t)^2 - 2 a t. Therefore:\n\n2(a² + t²)/(a + t) = 2[ (a + t)^2 - 2 a t ] / (a + t ) = 2(a + t) - 4 a t / (a + t )\n\nBut not sure if helpful. Alternatively, maybe perform polynomial division on a² + t² divided by a + t.\n\nDividing a² + t² by a + t:\n\na² + t² = (a + t)(a - t) + 2 t². Wait, no:\n\nWait, (a + t)(a - t) = a² - t², so a² + t² = (a + t)(a - t) + 2 t². Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rationalizing:\n\nLet me denote x = t / a. Let me set x as a variable between 0 and 1, since t ranges from 0 to a (since t goes up to S/2 = a). Therefore, t = a x, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nTherefore, substituting into A:\n\nA = [ 2(a² + t² ) / (a + t ) ]² = [ 2(a² + a² x² ) / (a + a x ) ]² = [ 2 a² (1 + x² ) / (a (1 + x )) ]² = [ 2 a (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]² = 4 a² [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]².\n\nSince a² = 504, then A = 4 * 504 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]² = 2016 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]².\n\nTherefore, A = 2016 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]².\n\nTherefore, since A must be an integer less than 2016, we have that [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]² must be a rational number such that when multiplied by 2016 gives an integer less than 2016. Therefore, [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]² < 1, so (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) < 1. Let me check that.\n\nSince x is between 0 and 1, let me compute (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Let me note that 1 + x² - (1 + x ) = x² - x = x(x - 1). Since x is between 0 and 1, x(x - 1) is negative, so 1 + x² < 1 + x, hence (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) < 1. Therefore, A < 2016, as required.\n\nTherefore, A is 2016 multiplied by something less than 1. Therefore, our problem reduces to finding x in [0, 1] such that A is integer, and then compute the corresponding area of IJKL.\n\nBut how does x relate to the area of IJKL?\n\nEarlier, we had that area of IJKL is 1008 + 2 t². Since t = a x, and a² = 504, then t² = a² x² = 504 x². Therefore, area of IJKL is 1008 + 2 * 504 x² = 1008 + 1008 x² = 1008(1 + x² ). Therefore, area(IJKL) = 1008(1 + x² ).\n\nBut we also have that A = 2016 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]². Let me write down both expressions:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s denote y = 1 + x².\n\nThen area(IJKL) = 1008 y.\n\nAnd A = 2016 * [ y / (1 + x ) ]².\n\nBut since y = 1 + x², and we can relate y and x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express A in terms of area(IJKL).\n\nLet me note that area(IJKL) = 1008 y => y = area(IJKL)/1008.\n\nAlso, since A = 2016 * [ y / (1 + x ) ]².\n\nBut we need another relation between y and x. Since y = 1 + x², and we need to express 1 + x in terms of y and x. Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express 1 + x in terms of y?\n\nAlternatively, note that since y = 1 + x², then 1 + x = ?\n\nNot directly. Alternatively, perhaps express A in terms of area(IJKL):\n\nLet me denote K = area(IJKL) = 1008(1 + x² )\n\nTherefore, 1 + x² = K / 1008.\n\nAlso, note that A = 2016 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]² = 2016 * [ (K / 1008 ) / (1 + x ) ]² = 2016 * (K² ) / (1008² (1 + x )² ) = (2016 / 1008² ) * K² / (1 + x )² = (2 / 1008 ) * K² / (1 + x )² = (1 / 504 ) * K² / (1 + x )².\n\nBut this seems more complex. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider that A = 2016 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]² and K = 1008(1 + x² ). Let me express A in terms of K:\n\nLet me note that [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]² = [ (K / 1008 ) / (1 + x ) ]². Therefore, A = 2016 * [ K / 1008 / (1 + x ) ]² = 2016 * K² / (1008² (1 + x )² ) = 2 * K² / (1008 (1 + x )² ). Therefore:\n\nA = (2 / 1008 ) * K² / (1 + x )² = (1 / 504 ) * K² / (1 + x )².\n\nBut still not helpful unless we can relate (1 + x ) to K.\n\nAlternatively, since K = 1008(1 + x² ), and we need to find A as integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express A in terms of K and some other variable.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about rational solutions. Since A must be integer, and 2016 is divisible by many numbers, perhaps we can find rational numbers for [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]² such that when multiplied by 2016 gives integer. Let me denote r = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Then A = 2016 r² must be integer. Also, since x is between 0 and 1, r is between (1 + 0)/ (1 + 0) = 1 and (1 + 1)/ (1 + 1) = 1, but wait, earlier we saw that r < 1. Wait, for x in (0, 1):\n\nAt x = 0: r = 1 / 1 = 1.\n\nAt x approaching 1: r approaches (1 + 1)/ (1 + 1) = 1, but earlier we saw that r < 1. Wait, actually, when x approaches 1, let me compute r:\n\n(1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). For x approaching 1, it approaches (2)/2 = 1. For x approaching 0, it approaches 1. Wait, but in between?\n\nLet me take x = 0.5: (1 + 0.25)/ (1 + 0.5) = 1.25 / 1.5 ≈ 0.833...\n\nSo r decreases from 1 to some minimum and then increases back to 1? Wait, let me check derivative.\n\nLet me consider r(x) = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Compute derivative:\n\nr’(x) = [ 2x(1 + x ) - (1 + x² )(1) ] / (1 + x )² = [ 2x + 2x² - 1 - x² ] / (1 + x )² = [ x² + 2x - 1 ] / (1 + x )².\n\nSet derivative to zero: x² + 2x - 1 = 0 => x = [ -2 ± sqrt(4 + 4 ) ] / 2 = [ -2 ± sqrt(8) ] / 2 = [ -2 ± 2√2 ] / 2 = -1 ± √2. Since x is in [0, 1], the critical point is at x = -1 + √2 ≈ -1 + 1.414 ≈ 0.414. Therefore, r(x) has a minimum at x ≈ 0.414. Therefore, r(x) decreases from x=0 to x≈0.414, then increases back to 1 at x=1. Therefore, the minimum value of r(x) is r(-1 + √2).\n\nCompute that:\n\nLet me compute r(-1 + √2):\n\nLet x = √2 - 1 ≈ 0.414.\n\nCompute 1 + x²:\n\nx = √2 - 1, so x² = (√2 - 1)^2 = 2 - 2√2 + 1 = 3 - 2√2.\n\nTherefore, 1 + x² = 1 + 3 - 2√2 = 4 - 2√2.\n\nDenominator 1 + x = 1 + √2 - 1 = √2.\n\nTherefore, r(x) = (4 - 2√2)/√2 = [4 / √2] - [2√2 / √2] = 2√2 - 2 ≈ 2.828 - 2 = 0.828, which matches the approximate value earlier. Therefore, the minimum value of r(x) is 2√2 - 2 ≈ 0.828, and maximum is 1.\n\nTherefore, A ranges from 2016*(2√2 - 2)^2 up to 2016*1 = 2016. However, since A must be integer and less than 2016, we need A in (something, 2016). But our goal is to find for which K (area of IJKL) there exists an integer A.\n\nBut how do we relate K and A?\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nK = 1008(1 + x² )\n\nand A = 2016 * r² = 2016 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]².\n\nLet me express A in terms of K:\n\nLet me denote y = 1 + x², so K = 1008 y.\n\nLet me denote z = 1 + x. Then note that:\n\ny = 1 + x² = z² - 2x.\n\nBut z = 1 + x => x = z - 1. Therefore:\n\ny = 1 + (z - 1)^2 = 1 + z² - 2z + 1 = z² - 2z + 2.\n\nTherefore, A = 2016*(y / z )² = 2016*( (z² - 2z + 2)/z )² = 2016*( z - 2 + 2/z )². Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since K = 1008 y and A = 2016*(y/z )², we can write:\n\nA = 2 * 1008 * (y/z )² = 2 * (K) * (y/z )² / y ? Wait, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, express z in terms of y and x, but not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since K = 1008 y and A = 2016*(y/z )², then:\n\nLet me solve for z:\n\nFrom A = 2016*(y/z )² => (y/z )² = A / 2016 => y/z = sqrt(A / 2016 ) => z = y / sqrt(A / 2016 ) = y * sqrt(2016 / A )\n\nBut z = 1 + x, and y = 1 + x². Also, since x = z - 1, then y = 1 + (z - 1)^2 = z² - 2z + 2. Therefore:\n\nz² - 2z + 2 = y = z * sqrt(2016 / A ) * (K / 1008 ) ?\n\nWait, no, since K = 1008 y => y = K / 1008. Therefore:\n\nz² - 2z + 2 = K / 1008.\n\nBut also z = y * sqrt(2016 / A ) = (K / 1008 ) * sqrt(2016 / A ). Therefore:\n\nLet me denote z = (K / 1008 ) * sqrt(2016 / A ). Therefore:\n\nz² - 2z + 2 = K / 1008.\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me think numerically. Since A must be integer, and A = 2016 * r² where r is between approx 0.828 and 1, then A is between approx 2016*(0.828)^2 ≈ 2016*0.685 ≈ 1380 and 2016. Therefore, possible integer values of A are integers from 1381 up to 2015. However, not all integers in this range are achievable. Also, since A must be such that there exists x in [0,1] making A = 2016 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]². Therefore, we need to find integers A such that sqrt(A / 2016 ) = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) for some x in [0,1].\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(A / 2016 ). Then s = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Since s ∈ [2√2 - 2, 1], as established earlier.\n\nTherefore, for each integer A between approx 1380 and 2015, check if s = sqrt(A / 2016 ) can be expressed as (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) for some real x in [0,1]. However, since A must be integer, and we need to find such A that this equation holds for some x.\n\nAlternatively, since s = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ), let me solve for x in terms of s:\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x ):\n\ns(1 + x ) = 1 + x² => s + s x = 1 + x² => x² - s x + (1 - s ) = 0.\n\nSolving quadratic equation for x:\n\nx = [ s ± sqrt(s² - 4 * 1 * (1 - s )) ] / 2 = [ s ± sqrt(s² - 4 + 4s ) ] / 2 = [ s ± sqrt(s² + 4s - 4 ) ] / 2.\n\nFor real solutions, discriminant must be non-negative:\n\ns² + 4s - 4 ≥ 0 => s² + 4s - 4 ≥ 0.\n\nSolving s² + 4s - 4 = 0:\n\ns = [ -4 ± sqrt(16 + 16 ) ] / 2 = [ -4 ± sqrt(32) ] / 2 = [ -4 ± 4√2 ] / 2 = -2 ± 2√2.\n\nSince s is positive (as A is positive), we consider s ≥ -2 + 2√2 ≈ -2 + 2.828 ≈ 0.828. Which matches our previous result that s ∈ [≈0.828, 1]. Therefore, for s in [ -2 + 2√2, 1 ], there exists real solutions for x.\n\nBut since we need x ∈ [0,1], we need to check whether the solutions for x are in that interval.\n\nLet me take x = [ s ± sqrt(s² + 4s - 4 ) ] / 2. Let me analyze the two roots.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(s² + 4s - 4 ) as sqrt(D). Since D = s² + 4s - 4.\n\nFor s ∈ [ -2 + 2√2, 1 ]:\n\nAt s = -2 + 2√2 ≈ 0.828, D = s² + 4s - 4. Let me compute:\n\nLet me compute s = -2 + 2√2. Then s + 2 = 2√2. Therefore, s² = ( -2 + 2√2 )² = 4 - 8√2 + 8 = 12 - 8√2 ≈ 12 - 11.31 = 0.69.\n\nThen D = s² + 4s - 4 = (12 - 8√2 ) + 4*(-2 + 2√2 ) - 4 = 12 - 8√2 - 8 + 8√2 - 4 = 0. Therefore, discriminant is zero. Therefore, x = [ s ] / 2 = s / 2 ≈ 0.414, which is in [0,1].\n\nFor s approaching 1 from below, D approaches 1 + 4 - 4 = 1. Therefore sqrt(D) approaches 1. Therefore, x approaches [1 ± 1]/2, i.e., 1 or 0. Therefore, for s approaching 1, the solutions for x approach 0 and 1. Since x must be in [0,1], both roots are valid. However, since x is between 0 and 1, we need to check which roots are valid.\n\nBut for general s in [ -2 + 2√2, 1 ], we have two solutions for x. However, since x must be in [0,1], we need to see which of the roots lie in that interval.\n\nLet me consider the \"+\" and \"-\" solutions:\n\nx₁ = [ s + sqrt(D) ] / 2\n\nx₂ = [ s - sqrt(D) ] / 2\n\nGiven that s ∈ [≈0.828, 1], and sqrt(D) is between 0 and 1.\n\nAt s = 0.828, sqrt(D) = 0, so x₁ = x₂ = s / 2 ≈ 0.414.\n\nAt s approaching 1, sqrt(D) approaches 1, so x₁ approaches (1 + 1)/2 = 1, and x₂ approaches (1 - 1)/2 = 0. Therefore, both x₁ and x₂ are in [0,1] for s ∈ [≈0.828, 1]. Therefore, for each s in that interval, there are two x's in [0,1], symmetric around s/2?\n\nWait, but since x₁ + x₂ = [s + sqrt(D) + s - sqrt(D)] / 2 = 2s / 2 = s. So the two roots add up to s. Given that s ∈ [≈0.828, 1], and x₁ ∈ [≈0.414, 1], x₂ ∈ [0, ≈0.414]. Therefore, both roots are valid, but since x is a parameter between 0 and 1, both correspond to different positions.\n\nHowever, since our problem doesn't specify any particular condition on IJKL other than containing EFGH with integer area, both values of x would correspond to the same s and hence same A. However, since area of IJKL is 1008(1 + x² ), which depends on x, different x's would give different K (area of IJKL). Therefore, for each A, there are two possible K's? Or maybe not?\n\nWait, let me check. For a given s, which corresponds to a given A, there are two different x's, which would give different 1 + x², hence different K. Therefore, for each A, there are two possible K's. However, since the problem asks for the possible integer areas of IJKL, we need to consider both possibilities.\n\nHowever, since we need to find the difference between the largest and smallest possible K, maybe for each A, there are two K's, but we need to collect all possible K's over all valid A's, then find max K - min K.\n\nBut how do we find all integer A's such that s = sqrt(A / 2016 ) is in [ -2 + 2√2, 1 ], i.e., A is between [2016*( -2 + 2√2 )², 2016].\n\nCompute 2016*( -2 + 2√2 )²:\n\nFirst, (-2 + 2√2 )² = 4 - 8√2 + 8 = 12 - 8√2 ≈ 12 - 11.3137 ≈ 0.6863.\n\nTherefore, A_min ≈ 2016 * 0.6863 ≈ 2016 * 0.686 ≈ Let me compute 2000 * 0.686 = 1372, 16 * 0.686 ≈ 10.98. Total ≈ 1372 + 11 = 1383. Therefore, A must be integer between 1384 and 2015 inclusive? Wait, but exact value?\n\nWait, exact value is A_min = 2016*(12 - 8√2 ). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, note that (-2 + 2√2 )² = 4(√2 - 1)^2 = 4*(3 - 2√2 ). Wait:\n\nWait, (√2 - 1)^2 = 2 - 2√2 + 1 = 3 - 2√2. Therefore, (-2 + 2√2 )² = 4*(√2 - 1)^2 = 4*(3 - 2√2 ). Therefore, A_min = 2016 * 4*(3 - 2√2 ). Wait, no:\n\nWait, A_min = 2016 * [ (-2 + 2√2 )² ] = 2016 * [ 4*(√2 - 1)^2 ] = 2016 * 4*(3 - 2√2 ). Wait, no:\n\nWait, (-2 + 2√2 )² = 4*(√2 - 1)^2 = 4*(3 - 2√2 ). Therefore, A_min = 2016 * 4*(3 - 2√2 ). Wait, no, A_min = 2016 * [ (-2 + 2√2 )² ] = 2016 * [ 4*(√2 - 1)^2 ] = 2016 * 4*(3 - 2√2 ). Wait, but 4*(3 - 2√2 ) is about 4*(3 - 2.828) ≈ 4*(0.172) ≈ 0.688, so 2016*0.688 ≈ 1385. So exact value is messy, but approximate value is ≈1383. Therefore, integer A's from 1384 to 2015.\n\nBut since A must be integer, and for each integer A in that range, we can check if s = sqrt(A / 2016 ) can be expressed as (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) for some x in [0,1]. However, since we derived that for any s in [ -2 + 2√2, 1 ], there exists such x, then for each integer A in that range, there exists x. However, not necessarily. Because even though mathematically for each s in that interval there exists x, when we impose that A must be integer, there might be constraints on A.\n\nBut since A = 2016 * r², and r = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ), and x is real, then A can take any real value in [A_min, 2016). Therefore, there are infinitely many real A's in that interval, but we need only integer A's. Therefore, all integers from ceil(A_min) up to 2015 inclusive are possible? But not necessarily. Because even though for each real A in that interval there exists x, when A is rational, does there exist x such that (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) is rational? Because A must be integer, so r² must be rational, since 2016 is integer. Therefore, r must be rational or irrational? If A is integer, then r² = A / 2016 must be rational. Therefore, r is sqrt(A / 2016 ). Therefore, unless A / 2016 is a square of rational number, r would be irrational, but x would still exist as real number. However, our problem doesn't require x to be rational, just that A is integer. Therefore, for any integer A between ceil(A_min) and 2015, there exists real x such that A = 2016 * [ (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) ]². Therefore, all integers in that range are possible?\n\nBut that can't be true because the mapping from x to A is continuous, so between A_min and 2016, every real number is achievable, hence every integer in that interval is achievable. Therefore, the number of possible integer areas A is 2015 - ceil(A_min) + 1. However, the problem states that EFGH has a smaller positive integer area, so A is integer between 1 and 2015, but due to the construction, A must be between approx 1383 and 2015. Therefore, all integers from 1384 up to 2015 are possible. However, this seems too broad, and the problem asks for the difference between the largest and smallest possible integer areas for IJKL. If all integer A are possible, then for each A, there are two K's (area of IJKL). Therefore, we need to find the range of K's.\n\nBut how does K relate to A?\n\nRecall that K = 1008(1 + x² ) and A = 2016*( (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) )².\n\nLet me express K in terms of A and x.\n\nFrom A = 2016*( (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) )² => sqrt(A / 2016 ) = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Let me denote this as:\n\nLet me write sqrt(A / 2016 ) = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) => Let me call this equation (1).\n\nAlso, K = 1008(1 + x² ). Let me call this equation (2).\n\nLet me solve equations (1) and (2) for K in terms of A.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n(1 + x² ) = sqrt(A / 2016 ) * (1 + x )\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\nK = 1008(1 + x² ) = 1008 * sqrt(A / 2016 ) * (1 + x ) = 1008 * sqrt(A / 2016 ) * (1 + x )\n\nTherefore:\n\nK = 1008 * sqrt(A / 2016 ) * (1 + x )\n\nLet me simplify sqrt(A / 2016 ):\n\nsqrt(A / 2016 ) = sqrt(A ) / sqrt(2016 )\n\nTherefore:\n\nK = 1008 * [ sqrt(A ) / sqrt(2016 ) ] * (1 + x ) = [ 1008 / sqrt(2016 ) ] * sqrt(A ) * (1 + x )\n\nNote that 1008 / sqrt(2016 ) = 1008 / sqrt(2 * 1008 ) = 1008 / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(1008 )) = sqrt(1008 ) / sqrt(2 ) = sqrt(1008 / 2 ) = sqrt(504 )\n\nTherefore, K = sqrt(504 ) * sqrt(A ) * (1 + x )\n\nBut from equation (1), we have:\n\n(1 + x ) = (1 + x² ) / sqrt(A / 2016 )\n\nBut from equation (2), 1 + x² = K / 1008. Therefore:\n\n(1 + x ) = (K / 1008 ) / sqrt(A / 2016 ) = K / 1008 * sqrt(2016 / A ) = K * sqrt(2016 ) / (1008 * sqrt(A )) = K * sqrt(2016 ) / (1008 * sqrt(A )).\n\nBut sqrt(2016 ) = sqrt(2 * 1008 ) = sqrt(2 ) * sqrt(1008 ). Therefore:\n\n(1 + x ) = K * sqrt(2 ) * sqrt(1008 ) / (1008 * sqrt(A )) = K * sqrt(2 ) / sqrt(1008 ) / sqrt(A ) * sqrt(1008 ) = K * sqrt(2 ) / sqrt(A ) / sqrt(1008 ) * sqrt(1008 )? Wait:\n\nWait:\n\nLet me recompute:\n\n(1 + x ) = K * sqrt(2016 ) / (1008 * sqrt(A )) = K * sqrt(2 * 1008 ) / (1008 * sqrt(A )) = K * sqrt(2 ) * sqrt(1008 ) / (1008 * sqrt(A )) = K * sqrt(2 ) / (sqrt(1008 ) * sqrt(A )) * sqrt(1008 ) ? No:\n\nWait, sqrt(2 ) * sqrt(1008 ) divided by 1008 is sqrt(2 ) / sqrt(1008 ). Because sqrt(1008 ) * sqrt(1008 ) = 1008. Therefore:\n\n(1 + x ) = K * sqrt(2 ) / sqrt(1008 ) / sqrt(A ) * sqrt(1008 ) ? No, sorry:\n\nWait:\n\nsqrt(2 ) * sqrt(1008 ) divided by 1008 is sqrt(2 ) / sqrt(1008 ), since sqrt(1008 ) / 1008 = 1 / sqrt(1008 ). Therefore:\n\n(1 + x ) = K * sqrt(2 ) / sqrt(1008 ) / sqrt(A ) ?\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me go back.\n\nWe had:\n\nK = sqrt(504 ) * sqrt(A ) * (1 + x )\n\nBut we also have from equation (1):\n\n(1 + x ) = (1 + x² ) / sqrt(A / 2016 ) = [ K / 1008 ] / sqrt(A / 2016 )\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1 + x ) = [ K / 1008 ] / [ sqrt(A ) / sqrt(2016 ) ] = [ K / 1008 ] * [ sqrt(2016 ) / sqrt(A ) ] = K * sqrt(2016 ) / (1008 sqrt(A )).\n\nTherefore, substituting back into K:\n\nK = sqrt(504 ) * sqrt(A ) * [ K * sqrt(2016 ) / (1008 sqrt(A )) ] => K = sqrt(504 ) * sqrt(A ) * K * sqrt(2016 ) / (1008 sqrt(A )) => simplifies to:\n\nK = sqrt(504 ) * K * sqrt(2016 ) / 1008.\n\nDivide both sides by K (assuming K ≠ 0, which it isn't):\n\n1 = sqrt(504 ) * sqrt(2016 ) / 1008.\n\nLet me check if this is true:\n\nsqrt(504 ) * sqrt(2016 ) = sqrt(504 * 2016 ). Compute 504 * 2016:\n\nNote that 504 * 2016 = 504 * 2016. Let me compute 504 * 2016:\n\nBut 504 is half of 1008, and 2016 is double of 1008. Therefore, 504 * 2016 = (1008 / 2 ) * 2 * 1008 ) = 1008². Therefore sqrt(504 * 2016 ) = sqrt(1008² ) = 1008. Therefore, 1 = 1008 / 1008 = 1. Yes, correct. Therefore, the equation is valid. Therefore, this doesn't give us new information. Therefore, we need another approach.\n\nLet me think again. Since K = 1008(1 + x² ) and A = 2016*( (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) )², let me express K in terms of A and x. From A's equation:\n\nLet me denote that (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) = sqrt(A / 2016 ). Let me square both sides:\n\n(1 + x² )² / (1 + x )² = A / 2016.\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n2016(1 + x² )² = A(1 + x )².\n\nBut from K = 1008(1 + x² ), so 1 + x² = K / 1008. Substitute:\n\n2016*(K / 1008 )² = A(1 + x )² => 2016*(K² / 1008² ) = A(1 + x )² => 2*K² / 1008 = A(1 + x )² => K² / 504 = A(1 + x )².\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1 + x )² = K² / (504 A ).\n\nBut also, from earlier, we had that K = sqrt(504 ) * sqrt(A ) * (1 + x ). Let me square both sides:\n\nK² = 504 A (1 + x )².\n\nBut this is exactly the same as the above equation. Therefore, again, no new info.\n\nTherefore, I need another way to relate K and A.\n\nLet me consider that for each A, there are two values of x leading to two values of K. Therefore, for each A, there are two K's. Therefore, if I can express K in terms of A, I can find the range of K.\n\nLet me recall that K = 1008(1 + x² ) and A = 2016*( (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) )².\n\nLet me denote u = 1 + x. Then x = u - 1, so 1 + x² = 1 + (u - 1)^2 = 1 + u² - 2u + 1 = u² - 2u + 2.\n\nTherefore, K = 1008(u² - 2u + 2), and A = 2016*( (u² - 2u + 2)/u )².\n\nLet me write A as:\n\nA = 2016 * [ (u² - 2u + 2)/u ]² = 2016 * [ u - 2 + 2/u ]².\n\nTherefore, for each u in [something], we can express A and K.\n\nBut since x ∈ [0, 1], u = 1 + x ∈ [1, 2]. Therefore, u ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nTherefore, for u ∈ [1, 2], we can express A and K. Therefore, for each u in [1, 2], there is a corresponding A and K. Therefore, to find all possible K for integer A, we need to consider u ∈ [1, 2] such that A is integer.\n\nBut since u can be any real number in [1, 2], and A is a continuous function of u, as before, for every integer A between approx 1383 and 2016, there exists u in [1, 2] giving that A. Therefore, for each such A, there are two u's (since for each A, two x's leading to two u's). Therefore, for each A, two K's.\n\nTherefore, to find the range of K, we need to find the min and max of K over all u ∈ [1, 2], given that A is integer.\n\nBut since u ranges from 1 to 2, let's analyze K as a function of u:\n\nK(u) = 1008(u² - 2u + 2). Let's analyze this function.\n\nCompute derivative dK/du = 1008(2u - 2) = 2016(u - 1). Since u ∈ [1, 2], derivative is non-negative (0 at u=1, positive for u > 1). Therefore, K(u) is increasing on [1, 2]. Therefore, minimum K is at u=1, maximum at u=2.\n\nCompute K(1) = 1008(1 - 2 + 2) = 1008(1) = 1008.\n\nK(2) = 1008(4 - 4 + 2) = 1008(2) = 2016.\n\nTherefore, K ranges from 1008 to 2016 as u increases from 1 to 2. Therefore, since K is continuous and strictly increasing, for every K in [1008, 2016], there is a unique u in [1, 2]. However, we have the constraint that A must be integer. Therefore, for each integer A in [A_min, 2016), there is a corresponding K in [1008, 2016). Therefore, the possible values of K are all values between 1008 and 2016, but only those K for which there exists an integer A such that A = 2016 * [ (u² - 2u + 2)/u ]², where u corresponds to K via K = 1008(u² - 2u + 2).\n\nBut since K is strictly increasing, and A is some function of u, we need to find the min and max K such that A is integer. However, since A can be any integer in [A_min, 2016), and K ranges from 1008 to 2016, the min K is 1008 (when A is minimal) and max K is 2016 (when A approaches 2016). But since A must be smaller than 2016, K approaches 2016 but doesn't reach it. However, the problem says that the area of EFGH is a smaller positive integer, so A < 2016. Therefore, K approaches 2016 but doesn't include it. However, since K is continuous and A is dense in the interval, there are K's arbitrarily close to 2016 with A integer. But since we need integer areas for IJKL, which are between 1008 and 2016, inclusive? Wait, K ranges from 1008 to 2016, but can K be 2016? When u=2, which corresponds to x=1. Let me check what A is when u=2.\n\nWhen u=2, A = 2016 * [ (u² - 2u + 2)/u ]² = 2016 * [ (4 - 4 + 2)/2 ]² = 2016 * [ 2 / 2 ]² = 2016 * 1 = 2016. But the problem states that EFGH has a smaller area, so A must be less than 2016. Therefore, u=2 is excluded. Therefore, K approaches 2016 but doesn't reach it. However, since K is continuous and we are to find integer values of K, the maximum possible integer value of K less than 2016 is 2015? But wait, K is not necessarily integer. The problem says that the area of IJKL must be a positive integer. Wait, no! Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"Find the difference between the largest and smallest positive integer values for the area of IJKL.\"\n\nWait, the area of IJKL must be an integer? Wait, let me check the problem statement:\n\n\"Find the difference between the largest and smallest positive integer values for the area of IJKL.\"\n\nYes! So the area of IJKL must be an integer. Earlier, I thought A (area of EFGH) must be integer, which it is, but also the area of IJKL must be integer. Therefore, both A and K must be integers. Therefore, we need to find integer K in [1008, 2016) such that there exists an integer A < 2016 with A = 2016 * [ (u² - 2u + 2)/u ]² and K = 1008(u² - 2u + 2).\n\nTherefore, since K = 1008 * (u² - 2u + 2), and A = 2016 * [ (u² - 2u + 2)/u ]², we need both K and A to be integers.\n\nGiven that K is integer, since 1008 is integer and (u² - 2u + 2) must be rational? Because K is integer, so (u² - 2u + 2) must be rational. Let me denote v = u, which is in [1, 2]. Since u = 1 + x and x is real, u can be any real in [1, 2]. But for K to be integer, v² - 2v + 2 must be rational. Let me denote that as:\n\nLet’s let’s set v = p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors, and since v ∈ [1, 2], p and q satisfy q ≤ p ≤ 2q.\n\nThen v² - 2v + 2 = (p/q)² - 2(p/q) + 2 = (p² - 2 p q + 2 q² ) / q².\n\nFor this to be rational, it already is. But for K = 1008 * (p² - 2 p q + 2 q² ) / q² to be integer, we need q² to divide 1008 * (p² - 2 p q + 2 q² ). This seems complex.\n\nAdditionally, A = 2016 * [ (v² - 2v + 2 ) / v ]² must also be integer. Let me substitute v = p/q:\n\nA = 2016 * [ (p² - 2 p q + 2 q² ) / q² / (p/q) ]² = 2016 * [ (p² - 2 p q + 2 q² ) / (p q ) ]².\n\nTherefore, A = 2016 * [ (p² - 2 p q + 2 q² )² / (p² q² ) ] = 2016 * (p² - 2 p q + 2 q² )² / (p² q² ).\n\nFor A to be integer, the denominator must divide 2016 * (p² - 2 p q + 2 q² )².\n\nThis seems very involved. Perhaps there's a better way. Since both K and A must be integers, and they are related through u, maybe we can find rational solutions for u such that both K and A are integers.\n\nAlternatively, since K = 1008 * (u² - 2u + 2) and A = 2016 * [(u² - 2u + 2)/u]^2, let me set t = u² - 2u + 2. Then K = 1008 t, and A = 2016 * (t / u )². Therefore, since K is integer, t must be rational (since 1008 is integer). Let me denote t = m / n, where m and n are integers with no common factors. Then K = 1008 * m / n must be integer, so n divides 1008 m. Since m and n are coprime, n divides 1008. Similarly, A = 2016 * (m / n / u )². But u is related to t via t = u² - 2u + 2. Let me solve for u:\n\nt = u² - 2u + 2 => u² - 2u + (2 - t ) = 0 => u = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 4(2 - t ))]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(4t - 4 )]/2 = [2 ± 2 sqrt(t - 1 )]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(t - 1 ). Since u ∈ [1, 2], we take the positive root: u = 1 + sqrt(t - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, u = 1 + sqrt(t - 1 ). Therefore, A = 2016 * (t / u )² = 2016 * [ t / (1 + sqrt(t - 1 )) ]².\n\nBut since t = m / n, this becomes:\n\nA = 2016 * [ (m/n ) / (1 + sqrt( m/n - 1 )) ]².\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps if we let sqrt(t - 1 ) be rational, then u would be rational, and t would be rational. Let me set sqrt(t - 1 ) = r / s, where r and s are integers with no common factors. Then t - 1 = r² / s² => t = 1 + r² / s² = (s² + r² ) / s². Therefore, u = 1 + r / s = (s + r ) / s. Therefore, u is rational, as expected.\n\nTherefore, with this substitution, t = (s² + r² ) / s², and u = (s + r ) / s.\n\nTherefore, let me substitute back into K and A.\n\nK = 1008 * t = 1008 * (s² + r² ) / s².\n\nA = 2016 * (t / u )² = 2016 * [ ( (s² + r² ) / s² ) / ( (s + r ) / s ) ]² = 2016 * [ (s² + r² ) / (s² ) * s / (s + r ) ]² = 2016 * [ (s² + r² ) / (s (s + r )) ]².\n\nSimplify numerator s² + r²:\n\ns² + r² = (s + r )² - 2 s r.\n\nBut not sure if helpful. Let me write A:\n\nA = 2016 * [ (s² + r² ) / (s (s + r )) ]².\n\nTherefore, both K and A must be integers. Given that r and s are positive integers with s > r (since u = (s + r ) / s < 2 => s + r < 2s => r < s), and gcd(r, s) = 1 (since we set sqrt(t - 1 ) = r / s in lowest terms).\n\nTherefore, our problem reduces to finding positive integers r and s with r < s, gcd(r, s) = 1, such that both K = 1008 * (s² + r² ) / s² and A = 2016 * [ (s² + r² ) / (s (s + r )) ]² are integers. Then, collect all such K, find the minimum and maximum, and subtract.\n\nThis seems like a feasible approach. Let me try to work with this.\n\nFirst, note that K = 1008 * (s² + r² ) / s² = 1008 * [1 + (r² / s² ) ] = 1008 + 1008 * r² / s². For K to be integer, 1008 * r² / s² must be integer. Since gcd(r, s) = 1, s² divides 1008 * r². Since gcd(r², s² ) = 1, s² divides 1008. Therefore, s² divides 1008. Therefore, s must be a divisor of sqrt(1008). But 1008 = 16 * 63 = 16 * 9 * 7 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 7^1. Therefore, s² must divide 2^4 * 3^2 * 7^1. For s² to divide this, all exponents in the prime factorization of s² must be less than or equal to those in 1008. Therefore, for each prime:\n\nFor 2: exponent in s² is ≤ 4 => exponent in s is ≤ 2.\n\nFor 3: exponent in s² is ≤ 2 => exponent in s is ≤ 1.\n\nFor 7: exponent in s² is ≤ 1 => exponent in s is ≤ 0 (since exponent in s² must be even and ≤ 1, so only 0). Therefore, s can only have prime factors 2 and 3, with exponents:\n\n- For 2: 0, 1, or 2 (since s can have up to 2^2)\n- For 3: 0 or 1 (since s can have up to 3^1)\n- No factor of 7.\n\nTherefore, possible values for s are the divisors of 2^2 * 3^1 = 12, but considering exponents:\n\nPossible s values are:\n\n- 2^0 * 3^0 = 1\n- 2^1 * 3^0 = 2\n- 2^2 * 3^0 = 4\n- 2^0 * 3^1 = 3\n- 2^1 * 3^1 = 6\n- 2^2 * 3^1 = 12\n\nTherefore, possible s ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.\n\nNow, for each s in {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}, we can find possible r values such that r < s, gcd(r, s) = 1, and then compute K and A to check if A is integer.\n\nLet me go through each s:\n\n1. s = 1:\n\nPossible r: r < 1 => r = 0, but r must be positive integer. No solutions.\n\n2. s = 2:\n\nPossible r: 1 (since r < 2, gcd(1, 2) = 1).\n\nCompute K = 1008*(2² + 1²)/2² = 1008*(4 + 1)/4 = 1008*5/4 = 1008*(1.25) = 1260. Integer.\n\nCompute A = 2016 * [ (s² + r² ) / (s (s + r )) ]² = 2016 * [ (4 + 1 ) / (2*(2 + 1 )) ]² = 2016 * [ 5 / 6 ]² = 2016 * 25 / 36 = 2016 / 36 * 25 = 56 * 25 = 1400. Integer. So A = 1400, which is valid (integer, less than 2016).\n\nSo this gives K = 1260.\n\n3. s = 3:\n\nPossible r: 1, 2 (since r < 3 and gcd(r, 3) = 1).\n\nFor r = 1:\n\nK = 1008*(9 + 1)/9 = 1008*10/9 = 1008*(10)/9 = 112*10 = 1120. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (9 + 1 ) / (3*(3 + 1 )) ]² = 2016 * [10 / 12 ]² = 2016 * (5/6)^2 = same as before? Wait, 10/12 = 5/6. Yes, same as previous case. So A = 1400 again. Wait, but different s and r? Let me compute:\n\nYes, same value. So A = 1400, K = 1120.\n\nFor r = 2:\n\nCheck gcd(2, 3) = 1, yes.\n\nK = 1008*(9 + 4)/9 = 1008*13/9 = 1008/9 *13 = 112*13 = 1456. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (9 + 4 ) / (3*(3 + 2 )) ]² = 2016 * [13 / 15 ]² = 2016 * 169 / 225. Let me compute this:\n\n2016 / 225 = 8.96, 8.96 * 169 ≈ 1515. But need exact value. Let's see if 2016 * 169 is divisible by 225.\n\nFactor 2016: 2^5 * 3^2 * 7.\n\nFactor 225: 3^2 * 5^2.\n\nSo 2016 / 225 = (2^5 * 3^2 * 7 ) / (3^2 * 5^2 ) = (32 * 7 ) / 25 = 224 / 25.\n\nTherefore, A = (224 / 25 ) * 169 = (224 * 169 ) / 25. Check if this is integer.\n\n224 * 169: Let me compute 224 * 170 - 224 = 38080 - 224 = 37856.\n\nDivide by 25: 37856 / 25 = 1514.24, which is not integer. Therefore, A is not integer. Therefore, this case is invalid. Therefore, for s=3, r=2 gives invalid A. So only r=1 is valid, giving K=1120.\n\n4. s = 4:\n\nPossible r: 1, 3 (since r < 4, gcd(r,4)=1).\n\nFor r = 1:\n\nK = 1008*(16 + 1)/16 = 1008*17/16 = 1008/16 *17 = 63 *17 = 1071. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (16 + 1 ) / (4*(4 + 1 )) ]² = 2016 * [17 / 20 ]² = 2016 * 289 / 400. Check if integer.\n\n2016 / 400 = 5.04, 5.04 * 289 ≈ 1456. But exact value:\n\nFactor 2016 = 2^5 * 3^2 * 7.\n\n400 = 2^4 * 5^2.\n\nSo 2016 / 400 = (2^5 * 3^2 * 7 ) / (2^4 * 5^2 ) = 2 * 9 * 7 / 25 = 126 / 25.\n\nTherefore, A = 126/25 * 289 = (126 * 289 ) / 25. Check divisibility:\n\n126 and 25 are coprime. 289 is 17². 25 doesn't divide 126 or 289, so A is not integer. Therefore invalid.\n\nFor r = 3:\n\ngcd(3, 4) = 1.\n\nK = 1008*(16 + 9)/16 = 1008*25/16 = 1008/16 *25 = 63 * 25 = 1575. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (16 + 9 ) / (4*(4 + 3 )) ]² = 2016 * [25 / 28 ]² = 2016 * 625 / 784.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2016 / 784 = 2016 ÷ 784. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 16: 126 / 49 = 18 / 7. Wait:\n\nWait 784 = 28² = (4*7)² = 16*49.\n\n2016 / 784 = (2016 ÷ 16 ) / (784 ÷ 16 ) = 126 / 49 = 18 / 7.\n\nTherefore, A = (18 / 7 ) * 625 = (18 * 625 ) / 7. 625 / 7 is not integer, so A is not integer. Therefore invalid. So for s=4, no valid r.\n\nWait, but K was integer for r=1 and r=3, but A wasn't. So s=4 gives no valid solutions.\n\n5. s = 6:\n\nPossible r: integers < 6 with gcd(r, 6) = 1. These are r=1, 5.\n\nFor r=1:\n\nK = 1008*(36 + 1)/36 = 1008*37/36 = 1008/36 *37 = 28 *37 = 1036. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (36 + 1 ) / (6*(6 + 1 )) ]² = 2016 * [37 / 42 ]² = 2016 * 1369 / 1764.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2016 / 1764 = 2016 ÷ 1764 = 1.142857... Let me factor:\n\n2016 = 2^5 * 3^2 * 7.\n\n1764 = 42² = (2*3*7)^2 = 2² * 3² * 7².\n\nTherefore, 2016 / 1764 = (2^5 * 3^2 * 7 ) / (2^2 * 3^2 * 7^2 ) = 2^3 / 7 = 8 / 7.\n\nTherefore, A = (8 / 7 ) * 1369 = (8 * 1369 ) / 7. Check if 1369 divisible by 7: 7*195 = 1365, 1369 - 1365 = 4. Not divisible. Therefore A not integer. Invalid.\n\nFor r=5:\n\ngcd(5, 6) = 1.\n\nK = 1008*(36 + 25)/36 = 1008*61/36 = 1008/36 *61 = 28 *61 = 1708. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (36 + 25 ) / (6*(6 + 5 )) ]² = 2016 * [61 / 66 ]² = 2016 * 3721 / 4356.\n\nSimplify:\n\nFactor 2016 and 4356:\n\n2016 = 2^5 * 3^2 * 7.\n\n4356 = 66² = (6*11)^2 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 11^2.\n\nTherefore, 2016 / 4356 = (2^5 * 3^2 * 7 ) / (2^2 * 3^2 * 11^2 ) = 2^3 * 7 / 11^2 = 56 / 121.\n\nTherefore, A = 56/121 * 3721. Compute 3721 / 121 = 30.75... Wait, 121*30 = 3630, 3721 - 3630 = 91. Not divisible. Therefore A not integer. Invalid. So s=6 gives no valid solutions.\n\n6. s = 12:\n\nPossible r: integers < 12 with gcd(r, 12) = 1. These are r=1, 5, 7, 11.\n\nFor each r:\n\nr=1:\n\nK = 1008*(144 + 1)/144 = 1008*145/144 = 1008/144 *145 = 7 *145 = 1015. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (144 + 1 ) / (12*(12 + 1 )) ]² = 2016 * [145 / 156 ]² = 2016 * (145²)/ (12² * 13² ). Let me compute:\n\nSimplify 2016 / (12² * 13² ) ? Wait, better to factor:\n\nA = 2016 * (145²) / (12 * 13 )². Wait, denominator is [12*(12+1)]² = [12*13]^2 = (156)^2 = (12*13)^2.\n\nSo A = 2016 * 145² / (12² * 13² ). Let me compute:\n\n2016 / 12² = 2016 / 144 = 14.\n\nTherefore, A = 14 * 145² / 13². Compute 145² = 21025, 13² = 169.\n\nA = 14 * 21025 / 169. Check if 21025 divisible by 169:\n\n169 * 124 = 169*(120 + 4) = 20280 + 676 = 20956. 21025 - 20956 = 69. Not divisible. Therefore A not integer.\n\nFor r=5:\n\ngcd(5, 12)=1.\n\nK = 1008*(144 + 25)/144 = 1008*169/144 = 1008/144 *169 = 7 *169 = 1183. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (144 + 25 ) / (12*(12 + 5 )) ]² = 2016 * [169 / (12*17 ) ]² = 2016 * (169² ) / (204² ). Compute:\n\nDenominator: 204² = (12*17)^2 = 144*289.\n\nA = 2016 * (169² ) / (144 * 289 ). Simplify 2016 / 144 = 14.\n\nA = 14 * 169² / 289. Note that 169 = 13², 289 = 17².\n\nA = 14 * (13^4 ) / (17^2 ). Not sure if integer. Let me compute:\n\n14 * (28561 ) / 289 ≈ 14 * 99 = 1386. But exact value: 28561 / 289 = 99. (17² = 289; 17*17=289, 17*99=1683, wait no. Let me divide 28561 by 289:\n\n289*99 = 289*(100 - 1) = 28900 - 289 = 28611. But 28561 is less than that. Let me try 289*98 = 289*(100 - 2) = 28900 - 578 = 28322. Still less. 28561 - 28322 = 239. Not divisible. Therefore A not integer.\n\nFor r=7:\n\ngcd(7, 12) = 1.\n\nK = 1008*(144 + 49)/144 = 1008*193/144 = 1008/144 *193 = 7*193 = 1351. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (144 + 49 ) / (12*(12 + 7 )) ]² = 2016 * [193 / (12*19 ) ]² = 2016 * (193² ) / (228² ). Compute:\n\nDenominator: 228² = (12*19)^2 = 144*361.\n\nA = 2016 / 144 * 193² / 361 = 14 * (193² ) / 361. Since 361 = 19², and 193 is prime (I think). 193 divided by 19 is 10.15... Not integer. Therefore, A not integer.\n\nFor r=11:\n\ngcd(11, 12)=1.\n\nK = 1008*(144 + 121)/144 = 1008*265/144 = 1008/144 *265 = 7 *265 = 1855. Integer.\n\nA = 2016 * [ (144 + 121 ) / (12*(12 + 11 )) ]² = 2016 * [265 / (12*23 ) ]² = 2016 * (265² ) / (276² ). Compute:\n\nDenominator: 276² = (12*23)^2 = 144*529.\n\nA = 2016 / 144 * 265² / 529 = 14 * (265² ) / 529. 529 = 23². 265 divided by 23 is 11.52... Not integer. Therefore A not integer. So s=12 gives no valid solutions.\n\nSo, compiling all valid (s, r) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- s=2, r=1: K=1260, A=1400\n- s=3, r=1: K=1120, A=1400\n- Any others? Let me check if I missed something.\n\nWait, for s=3, r=1 gives K=1120 and A=1400. For s=2, r=1 gives K=1260 and A=1400. So same A but different K.\n\nAre there other (s, r) pairs?\n\nWait, let me check if there are other s and r where K and A are integers. From our analysis above, only the cases for s=2, r=1 and s=3, r=1 give valid integer A. But perhaps there are more solutions where s² doesn't divide 1008 but due to other factors? Wait, earlier assumption was that s² divides 1008 because K = 1008*(s² + r²)/s² must be integer, and since gcd(r, s)=1, s² must divide 1008. But is this necessarily true?\n\nWait, suppose that s² doesn't divide 1008, but 1008*(s² + r²)/s² is integer. Let me denote K = 1008*(s² + r²)/s² = 1008*(1 + r²/s²). For this to be integer, the fractional part must cancel out. However, since r and s are coprime, r² and s² are coprime. Therefore, unless s² divides 1008*r², which since gcd(s², r²)=1, s² must divide 1008. Therefore, our initial assumption was correct. Therefore, there are no other s values beyond those we considered. Therefore, only the two cases above.\n\nTherefore, the only integer values of K are 1120 and 1260. Wait, but that seems too few. But according to our analysis, only these two. However, this contradicts the earlier thought that K ranges from 1008 to 2016. But according to this, only 1120 and 1260 are possible. But this can't be correct, because there must be more solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps there are other (s, r) pairs where s² divides 1008, but we didn't consider them? Wait, we considered all s where s² divides 1008. s ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. For s=1, no r. For s=2, one valid. For s=3, one valid. For s=4, none. For s=6, none. For s=12, none. So only two K's? But this seems unlikely. For example, take s= sqrt(1008 / t ), but we already considered all s with s² dividing 1008.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other ways where s² doesn't divide 1008, but K is still integer? But according to the earlier logic, no. Because K = 1008*(s² + r²)/s² = 1008 + 1008*r²/s². For this to be integer, 1008*r²/s² must be integer. Since r and s are coprime, s² divides 1008*r² implies s² divides 1008. Hence, our analysis is correct.\n\nTherefore, only K=1120 and K=1260 are valid? But that seems to contradict the problem's implication that there are multiple possible integer areas for IJKL. However, maybe there are more solutions where s and r are not coprime? Wait, but we set gcd(r, s)=1 because we assumed sqrt(t - 1) = r/s in lowest terms. However, maybe there are solutions where r and s are not coprime, but after simplifying, they reduce to the cases we already considered?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other rational numbers u where K and A are integers, not necessarily covered by our parametrization? For example, if u is rational but not of the form (s + r)/s with s² dividing 1008?\n\nThis is possible. Our parametrization assumed that sqrt(t - 1) is rational, leading to u rational. But there might be other rational u's where t - 1 is irrational, but K and A still end up integers. But this seems unlikely. Since if u is rational, then t = u² - 2u + 2 is rational, and sqrt(t - 1) would need to be rational for u to be rational. Therefore, our parametrization covers all rational u's leading to rational t and hence integer K and A.\n\nTherefore, if only two K's are valid, then the difference between the largest and smallest is 1260 - 1120 = 140. But this seems too small, and the problem says \"the difference between the largest and smallest positive integer values for the area of IJKL\". Given that the area of ABCD is 2016, and IJKL is between 1008 and 2016, getting only 1120 and 1260 seems too restrictive. Perhaps there's an error in my analysis.\n\nLet me double-check the cases where K and A are integers.\n\nFirst, for s=2, r=1: K=1260, A=1400. Let me verify A=1400 is integer. Yes, as calculated earlier.\n\nFor s=3, r=1: K=1120, A=1400. Same A.\n\nIs there another way to get different K's with integer A?\n\nWait, what if there are other (s, r) pairs where s² divides 1008 but we missed them? For example, s= sqrt(1008 / t ), but we considered all s with s² dividing 1008. Our list was s ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. Correct?\n\nYes, because s² must divide 2^4 * 3^2 * 7^1. For s² to divide this, s can have at most 2^2, 3^1, and no 7. Hence the possible s's are as above.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps there are other rational numbers u where K and A are integers, not covered by our parametrization because u is not of the form (s + r)/s? For example, suppose u is a fraction where s doesn't divide into 1008, but due to cancellation, K becomes integer. But according to our earlier logic, since K = 1008*(s² + r²)/s², and for this to be integer, s² must divide 1008*(s² + r²). Since s and r are coprime, s² divides 1008*s², which it does, but also s² divides 1008*r². Which requires s² divides 1008. Therefore, our earlier logic holds.\n\nTherefore, only two K's? But then the answer would be 140. However, given the problem is from an Olympiad, likely the answer is larger. Therefore, likely there is an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Perhaps my assumption that s² must divide 1008 is incorrect. Let me revisit.\n\nWe have K = 1008 * (s² + r²)/s² = 1008 + 1008*(r²/s²). For K to be integer, 1008*(r²/s²) must be integer. Let me denote that as 1008*(r²/s²) = integer. Let me write it as (1008 / s² ) * r² must be integer. Let me denote d = gcd(r, s). Let me set r = d * r', s = d * s', where gcd(r', s') = 1. Then:\n\n(1008 / (d² s'² )) * d² r'² = 1008 * r'² / s'² must be integer. Therefore, s'² divides 1008 * r'². Since gcd(r', s') = 1, s'² divides 1008. Therefore, s' must be one of the s values we considered earlier. Therefore, our previous analysis holds, but now allowing for d ≠ 1. Therefore, there might be other solutions where s is not in our list, but s' is, with d scaling.\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nLet me let s = d * s', r = d * r', where gcd(r', s') = 1, and s' ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.\n\nThen, K = 1008 * (s² + r²)/s² = 1008 * [ (d² s'² + d² r'² ) / d² s'² ] = 1008 * [ (s'² + r'² ) / s'² ] = same as before. Therefore, K is the same as if we took s' and r'. Therefore, scaling r and s by d doesn't change K. Therefore, our earlier analysis still holds, and there are no new K's.\n\nTherefore, the only integer K's are 1120 and 1260, leading to difference 140. But this seems unlikely. Let me check with specific examples.\n\nTake K=1120: area of IJKL is 1120. Then, according to our earlier relation, A=1400. Let me verify if with K=1120, there exists an integer A=1400.\n\nFrom K=1120, which corresponds to s=3, r=1. Let me compute u = (s + r)/s = (3 + 1)/3 = 4/3. Then, A = 2016 * [ (u² - 2u + 2)/u ]² = 2016 * [ (16/9 - 8/3 + 2 ) / (4/3) ]². Compute inside:\n\n16/9 - 8/3 + 2 = 16/9 - 24/9 + 18/9 = (16 - 24 + 18)/9 = 10/9. Divide by 4/3: (10/9) / (4/3) = 10/9 * 3/4 = 10/12 = 5/6. Square: 25/36. Multiply by 2016: 2016 * 25 / 36 = 56 * 25 = 1400. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for K=1260, u = (2 + 1)/2 = 3/2. Compute A = 2016 * [ ( (9/4 - 3 + 2 ) / (3/2) ) ]² = 2016 * [ (9/4 - 1 ) / (3/2) ]² = 2016 * [5/4 / 3/2]² = 2016 * [5/6]² = same as before, 1400. Correct.\n\nTherefore, these are valid.\n\nBut according to this, there are only two integer values for K: 1120 and 1260. Hence, difference is 140. But the problem says \"the difference between the largest and smallest positive integer values for the area of IJKL\". If there are only two, then 1260 - 1120 = 140. But this seems too straightforward for an Olympiad problem. Let me check if there are more solutions.\n\nWait, let's think outside the box. Perhaps there are other rational u's leading to integer K and A, not covered by our parametrization. For example, let's take u = 3/2, which we already did (leading to K=1260). What about u=5/3?\n\nLet me try u=5/3. Then t = u² - 2u + 2 = 25/9 - 10/3 + 2 = 25/9 - 30/9 + 18/9 = 13/9. Then K = 1008 * t = 1008 * 13/9 = 1008/9 *13 = 112*13 = 1456. Is K integer? Yes, 1456. Now check if A is integer.\n\nA = 2016 * (t / u )² = 2016 * ( (13/9 ) / (5/3 ) )² = 2016 * (13/15 )² = 2016 * 169 / 225. As computed earlier, this is not integer. So no good.\n\nWhat about u=5/4? Let's try:\n\nt = (25/16) - 2*(5/4) + 2 = 25/16 - 10/4 + 2 = 25/16 - 40/16 + 32/16 = 17/16. K = 1008 * 17/16 = 1008/16 *17 = 63*17 = 1071. Integer. A = 2016 * (17/16 / (5/4 ))² = 2016 * (17/16 * 4/5 )² = 2016 * (17/20 )² = 2016 * 289 / 400. As before, not integer.\n\nWhat about u=4/3? We did this earlier, leading to K=1071, A non-integer.\n\nWhat about u=5/2? But u must be ≤ 2, since u ∈ [1, 2]. 5/2 = 2.5 > 2, invalid.\n\nWhat about u= sqrt(2)? No, irrational.\n\nWhat about u= 1 + 1/√2? No, irrational.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other rational u's where s² doesn't divide 1008, but K is still integer. For example, let's take u= 5/4, K=1071, which is integer, but A is not. What if we take u such that 1008*(r²/s²) is integer, but s² doesn't divide 1008? For example, suppose s= sqrt(1008 / k), but this seems vague.\n\nWait, let's take K=1008 + 1008*(r²/s²) = integer. Let me denote that 1008*(r²/s²) is integer. Let me write this as (r/s)^2 = m / 1008, where m is integer. Therefore, r/s = sqrt(m / 1008). For r/s to be rational, m must be a multiple of 1008's square factors. Let me write 1008 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 7. Therefore, sqrt(m / 1008) is rational iff m is of the form 1008 * k², where k is rational. Let me set m = 1008 * k². Then (r/s)^2 = k² => r/s = k. Therefore, k is rational, say k = p/q, reduced fraction. Then m = 1008 * p² / q². Since m must be integer, q² divides 1008 * p². Since gcd(p, q)=1, q² divides 1008. This brings us back to our earlier analysis where q is in {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. Therefore, no new solutions.\n\nTherefore, it seems that only K=1120 and 1260 are valid. Therefore, the difference is 140. But let me check with the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says \"the area of EFGH is a smaller positive integer\". In our cases, A=1400, which is smaller than 2016. But is 1400 the only possible A? If yes, then there are only two K's: 1120 and 1260. But maybe there are other A's with multiple K's?\n\nWait, suppose there are other A's where multiple (s, r) pairs give integer A and K. But according to our analysis, no. For example, A=1400 is achieved by two different K's. Are there other A's?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there is another A, say A= something else, with corresponding K's. How?\n\nFor example, let's take s=2, r=1 and s=3, r=1 give A=1400. What if there are other (s, r) pairs giving other A's? For example, let me try s=1, but no r. What about s=4, r=1: K=1071, A non-integer. What about s=4, r= something else? No. s=6, no. s=12, no. So no other A's.\n\nTherefore, the only possible integer areas for IJKL are 1120 and 1260, leading to difference 140. But this seems too small, and also, the problem says \"the difference between the largest and smallest positive integer values for the area of IJKL\". If there are only two, then it's 140. But let me verify with another approach.\n\nLet me recall that K = 1008(1 + x² ) and A = 2016*( (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) )². Let me set y = 1 + x, then x = y - 1, so 1 + x² = y² - 2y + 2. So K = 1008(y² - 2y + 2), A = 2016*( (y² - 2y + 2)/y )². Let me let y be rational, say y = p/q in reduced terms. Then K = 1008(p² - 2pq + 2q²)/q². For K to be integer, q² divides 1008(p² - 2pq + 2q²). Since gcd(p, q)=1, q² divides 1008*2q², which it does, but more specifically, q² divides 1008*(...). This is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, since we found two solutions, maybe there are more by scaling? For example, if we take the solutions we have and scale them.\n\nBut scaling what? The square IJKL has area K, and EFGH has area A. If we scale the entire figure, but since the centers are fixed and areas are fixed (ABCD is fixed at 2016), scaling is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other rational values of y between 1 and 2 leading to integer K and A. For example, let me assume y = 5/4, leading to K=1071, A non-integer. What if y= 8/5?\n\nLet me try y=8/5 (1.6). Compute t = y² - 2y + 2 = 64/25 - 16/5 + 2 = 64/25 - 80/25 + 50/25 = 34/25. K = 1008 * 34/25 = (1008/25)*34. 1008 ÷ 25 = 40.32, 40.32 * 34 ≈ 1370.88, not integer.\n\nWhat about y= 5/3 ≈ 1.666... t = 25/9 - 10/3 + 2 = 25/9 - 30/9 + 18/9 = 13/9. K=1008 * 13/9 = 1456, which is integer. A = 2016 * (13/9 / (5/3 ))² = 2016 * (13/15)^2 = 2016 * 169 / 225 ≈ 1514.24, not integer. So no good.\n\nWhat about y= 3/2, which we did: K=1260, A=1400.\n\nWhat about y= 4/3: K=1008*(16/9 - 8/3 + 2) = 1008*(16/9 - 24/9 + 18/9) = 1008*(10/9) = 1120, which is integer. A=1400.\n\nWhat about y= 5/2: invalid, as y ≤ 2.\n\nWhat about y= sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, but irrational.\n\nWhat about y= 1.5, which is 3/2, already done.\n\nWhat about y= 1.25 = 5/4, already done.\n\nWhat about y= 1.2 = 6/5?\n\nt = (36/25) - 12/5 + 2 = 36/25 - 60/25 + 50/25 = 26/25. K = 1008 * 26/25 = (1008/25)*26 ≈ 40.32 * 26 ≈ 1048.32, not integer.\n\nWhat about y= 7/5 = 1.4?\n\nt = 49/25 - 14/5 + 2 = 49/25 - 70/25 + 50/25 = 29/25. K = 1008 * 29/25 ≈ 1008 * 1.16 = 1169.28, not integer.\n\ny= 7/4 = 1.75:\n\nt = 49/16 - 14/4 + 2 = 49/16 - 56/16 + 32/16 = 25/16. K = 1008 * 25/16 = 1008/16 *25 = 63 * 25 = 1575, which is integer. A = 2016 * (25/16 / (7/4 ))² = 2016 * (25/16 * 4/7 )² = 2016 * (25/28 )² = 2016 * 625 / 784. As before, this is 2016 / 784 * 625 = 2.571 * 625 ≈ 1607.14, not integer.\n\nSo no good.\n\nTherefore, only y= 4/3 and 3/2 give integer K and A. Hence, only K=1120 and 1260. Therefore, difference is 140.\n\nBut let me check if there are other solutions where A is integer, but not necessarily derived from our parametrization. For example, let me take A=1008. Is this possible?\n\nIf A=1008, then r² = A / 2016 = 1008 / 2016 = 1/2. Therefore, r = 1/√2, which is irrational. Therefore, no solution.\n\nWhat about A= 1296? Let me check.\n\nA=1296. Then r² = 1296 / 2016 = 1296/2016 = 9/14. r = 3/√14, irrational. No.\n\nA= 1400, which we have.\n\nA= 1600? r² = 1600/2016 = 25/49, r=5/7. Then r=5/7, which is rational. Let me see if this leads to integer K.\n\nFrom r = 5/7, and r = (s² + r² ) / (s (s + r )) ? Wait, no, r here is sqrt(A / 2016 ) = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Wait, let me recall.\n\nWait, r = sqrt(A / 2016 ) = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). If A=1600, then r = sqrt(1600/2016) = sqrt(25/49) = 5/7. So 5/7 = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Let me solve for x:\n\n5/7 = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) => 5(1 + x ) = 7(1 + x² ) => 5 + 5x = 7 + 7x² => 7x² - 5x + 2 = 0. Discriminant: 25 - 56 = -31 < 0. No real solution. Therefore, no such x. Hence, A=1600 is invalid.\n\nWhat about A= 1225? r = sqrt(1225/2016) = 35/sqrt(2016). Not rational.\n\nA= 1296: as above.\n\nA= 1134: r² = 1134/2016 = 27/48 = 9/16, r=3/4. Let's see if this leads to solution.\n\nr = 3/4 = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Solve:\n\n3/4 = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) => 3(1 + x ) = 4(1 + x² ) => 3 + 3x = 4 + 4x² => 4x² - 3x + 1 = 0. Discriminant: 9 - 16 = -7 < 0. No solution.\n\nA= 980: r² = 980/2016 = 245/504 = 35/72. Not a square.\n\nA= 1400: already valid.\n\nA= 1764: r² = 1764/2016 = 49/56 = 7/8. Not a square.\n\nA= 1587.6: but must be integer.\n\nTherefore, seems like only A=1400 is valid, leading to K=1120 and 1260.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1260 - 1120 = 140.\n\nBut to confirm, let me check if there are other A's. Let me take A= 1400, and see if there are other K's. For example, if there are other (s, r) pairs giving A=1400 and different K.\n\nFrom earlier, we have two K's for A=1400: 1120 and 1260. Are there more?\n\nFor example, suppose there is another (s, r) giving A=1400 and different K.\n\nLet me assume A=1400, so r = sqrt(1400/2016) = sqrt(25/36) = 5/6. Therefore, 5/6 = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Let me solve for x:\n\n5/6 = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) => 5(1 + x ) = 6(1 + x² ) => 5 + 5x = 6 + 6x² => 6x² - 5x + 1 = 0.\n\nSolve: x = [5 ± sqrt(25 - 24 )]/12 = [5 ± 1]/12 => x= 6/12=1/2 or x=4/12=1/3.\n\nTherefore, two solutions: x=1/2 and x=1/3.\n\nTherefore, for x=1/2:\n\nK = 1008(1 + (1/2)^2 ) = 1008(1 + 1/4) = 1008 * 5/4 = 1260.\n\nFor x=1/3:\n\nK = 1008(1 + (1/3)^2 ) = 1008(1 + 1/9) = 1008 * 10/9 = 1120.\n\nThese are the two K's we found earlier. Therefore, no other K's for A=1400. Therefore, only two K's.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 1260 - 1120 = 140. Hence, the answer is 140.\n\nBut to ensure this is correct, let me check if there are other A's. For example, let me try x=1/√2 - 1, but this is irrational. Let me think of another rational x.\n\nLet me take x=1/4. Then:\n\nr = (1 + (1/4)^2 ) / (1 + 1/4 ) = (1 + 1/16 ) / (5/4 ) = (17/16 ) / (5/4 ) = 17/20. Then A = 2016 * (17/20)^2 = 2016 * 289 / 400. As before, not integer.\n\nx=1/1: r = (1 + 1)/2 = 1, A=2016*1=2016, which is invalid.\n\nx=0: r=1/1=1, A=2016*1=2016, invalid.\n\nx=2/3: r = (1 + (4/9 )) / (1 + 2/3 ) = (13/9 ) / (5/3 ) = 13/15. A=2016*(13/15)^2, not integer.\n\nx=3/4: r = (1 + 9/16 ) / (1 + 3/4 ) = (25/16 ) / (7/4 ) = 25/28. A=2016*(25/28)^2 = 2016 * 625 / 784 = 2016/784 * 625 = 2.571 * 625 ≈ 1607.14, not integer.\n\nx=1/2: already done.\n\nx=2/5: r = (1 + 4/25 ) / (1 + 2/5 ) = (29/25 ) / (7/5 ) = 29/35. A=2016*(29/35)^2, not integer.\n\nTherefore, no other rational x giving integer A. Hence, only A=1400, with K=1120 and 1260.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 140.\n\nBut the problem says \"the area of EFGH is a smaller positive integer\". Since 1400 is smaller than 2016, it is valid. Hence, the answer is 140.\n\nBut let me check with the initial problem statement: \"Find the difference between the largest and smallest positive integer values for the area of IJKL.\"\n\nIf there are only two integer areas for IJKL, 1120 and 1260, then the difference is 140. Therefore, the answer is 140, so I should put \\boxed{140}.\n\nHowever, I have a lingering doubt because Olympiad problems often have more complex solutions. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, let me think about the parametrization. We found that for A=1400, there are two K's: 1120 and 1260. Are there other A's with other K's?\n\nFor example, let me consider if there are other rational solutions for r = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) leading to integer A.\n\nLet me assume r is rational, say r = p/q in lowest terms. Then:\n\np/q = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ). Let me solve for x:\n\np(1 + x ) = q(1 + x² ) => qx² - px + (q - p ) = 0.\n\nFor x to be real, discriminant must be non-negative: p² - 4q(q - p ) ≥ 0 => p² - 4q² + 4pq ≥ 0 => p² + 4pq - 4q² ≥ 0. Let me divide by q²: (p/q )² + 4(p/q ) - 4 ≥ 0. Let me set k = p/q, then k² + 4k - 4 ≥ 0. Solving k² + 4k - 4 = 0, k = [-4 ± sqrt(16 + 16 )]/2 = [-4 ± sqrt(32)]/2 = -2 ± 2√2. Since k = p/q > 0 (since p and q are positive integers), we have k ≥ -2 + 2√2 ≈ 0.828. Therefore, r ≥ -2 + 2√2 ≈ 0.828, which we already knew.\n\nNow, for r = p/q, to get A = 2016*(p/q)^2 integer, 2016*(p²/q²) must be integer. Therefore, q² divides 2016p². Since p and q are coprime, q² divides 2016. Hence, q is one of the divisors we considered earlier: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. For each q, p must satisfy the equation qx² - px + (q - p ) = 0, and x must be between 0 and 1.\n\nLet me try q=2, p=1 (which we did, leading to x=1/2 and x=1/3).\n\nFor q=3, p=1: equation is 3x² - 1x + (3 - 1 ) = 3x² - x + 2 = 0. Discriminant 1 - 24 = -23 < 0. No solution. Wait, but earlier for q=3, r=1/3, but that was in a different context. Wait, no, in this case, r = p/q = 1/3, but earlier we had r = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) = 1/3. Let me check if this is possible.\n\nWait, if r = 1/3, then 1/3 = (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ) => 1 + x = 3(1 + x² ) => 3x² - x + 2 = 0, which has no real roots. Hence, no solution. Therefore, for q=3, p=1, no solution. But earlier, with s=3, r=1, we had a solution. Wait, no, in the previous parametrization, we had s=3, r=1, leading to u=4/3, and r in this context is different. This r is (1 + x² ) / (1 + x ), while in the earlier parametrization, we had another r. This is confusing.\n\nIn any case, for q=3, p=2: r=2/3. Then equation: 3x² - 2x + (3 - 2 ) = 3x² - 2x + 1 = 0. Discriminant 4 - 12 = -8 < 0. No solution.\n\nq=3, p=2: no solution.\n\nq=4, p=3: r=3/4. Equation: 4x² - 3x + (4 - 3 ) = 4x² - 3x + 1 = 0. Discriminant 9 - 16 = -7 < 0. No solution.\n\nq=4, p=1: r=1/4. Equation: 4x² - 1x + (4 - 1 ) = 4x² - x + 3 = 0. Discriminant 1 - 48 = -47 < 0.\n\nq=4, p=3: no solution.\n\nq=6, p=5: r=5/6. Equation: 6x² - 5x + (6 - 5 ) = 6x² - 5x + 1 = 0. Discriminant 25 - 24 = 1 > 0. Solutions: x = [5 ± 1]/12 => x=6/12=1/2 or x=4/12=1/3. These are the solutions we had earlier, leading to K=1260 and 1120. So this is the same as before.\n\nq=6, p=5: gives the same solutions.\n\nq=6, other p: let's say p=1: r=1/6. Equation: 6x² - 1x + 5 = 0. Discriminant 1 - 120 < 0.\n\nq=12, p=... let's say p= something. For example, p=7, r=7/12. Equation: 12x² - 7x + (12 - 7 ) = 12x² - 7x + 5 = 0. Discriminant 49 - 240 < 0.\n\nTherefore, the only valid rational r's leading to real x are r=5/6 (from q=6, p=5), which gives x=1/2 and 1/3, leading to K=1260 and 1120. Hence, confirming our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the only possible integer areas for IJKL are 1120 and 1260, so the difference is 140. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{140}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{140}\n</think>"}
