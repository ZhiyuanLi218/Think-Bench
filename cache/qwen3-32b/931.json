Controlling **temperature and humidity** is essential for preserving ancient artworks. High humidity can lead to **mold growth** or **chemical degradation**, while extreme temperatures can cause **physical stress** or **chemical instability** in the pigments and the medium. Therefore, **A is correct**.\n\n---\n\n### Option B:  \n> **\"Malachite and azurite are not easily oxidized by air.\"**\n\nThis is also a **correct** statement. Both malachite and azurite are **basic copper salts**, and their chemical structures are **relatively stable** under normal atmospheric conditions. While copper is a **transition metal** that can undergo oxidation, these specific compounds are **not easily oxidized** in air unless exposed to **strong oxidizing agents** or **acidic environments**. Thus, **B is correct**.\n\n---\n\n### Option C:  \n> **\"Malachite and azurite pigments are resistant to acid and alkali.\"**\n\nThis is the **incorrect** statement. The pigments are **basic in nature** due to the presence of **Cu(OH)₂** and **CuCO₃**, both of which are **reactive to acids**. For example:\n\n- **CuCO₃** reacts with **acid** to form **CO₂**, **water**, and **copper salts**, causing **degradation**.\n- **Cu(OH)₂** also reacts with acids to produce **copper salts** and **water**.\n\nWhile they may be **more stable** in **alkaline** conditions, they are **not resistant to acids**, especially **strong acids** like sulfuric acid. Therefore, the claim of resistance to **both acid and alkali** is **not accurate**. So, **C is incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### Option D:  \n> **\"The mass fraction of copper in Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃ is higher than in Cu(OH)₂·2CuCO₃.\"**\n\nThis is a **correct** statement. By calculating the **mass fraction of copper** in both compounds:\n\n- **Malachite (Cu₂(OH)₂CO₃)**: ~57.5% Cu\n- **Azurite (Cu₃(OH)₂(CO₃)₂)**: ~55.3% Cu\n\nSince **malachite has a higher proportion of copper by mass**, this statement is **accurate**. Therefore, **D is correct**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about the pigments used in the Song Dynasty's painting \"A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains.\" The options are about whether certain statements are incorrect regarding malachite and azurite pigments. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the chemical formulas given. Malachite is Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃, and azurite is Cu(OH)₂·2CuCO₃. The question is asking which statement is incorrect.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. To preserve the painting, temperature and humidity must be controlled. That makes sense because high humidity could cause degradation of the pigments or the paper/canvas. Also, temperature affects chemical reactions, so controlling it would help preserve the artwork. So A seems correct, not the incorrect one.\n\nB. Malachite and azurite are not easily oxidized by air. Copper compounds can sometimes be oxidized, but if they are already in a stable form, maybe they aren't. However, I remember that copper compounds like these might be stable under normal conditions. For example, malachite is a green pigment that's been used historically because it's stable. So B could be correct, but maybe there's a catch here.\n\nC. The pigments are resistant to acid and alkali. Wait, copper hydroxide and carbonate are basic compounds. If they are exposed to acid, they would react. For example, CuCO3 reacts with acid to produce CO2, water, and copper salts. Similarly, Cu(OH)2 would neutralize acids. So if the pigments are exposed to acidic or alkaline environments, they might degrade. Therefore, if option C says they are resistant to acid and alkali, that might be incorrect. Because they are basic, they would not be resistant to acids. So C is likely incorrect. But need to check the options again.\n\nD. The mass fraction of copper in Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃ is higher than in Cu(OH)₂·2CuCO₃. Let's calculate. Let me compute the molar mass for each compound and then the percentage of copper.\n\nFirst, for malachite: Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃. Let's break it down. That's two Cu atoms, two OH groups, and one CO3. Wait, the formula is Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃. So that's two Cu atoms? Because the first part is Cu(OH)₂ and the second is CuCO₃. So total Cu is 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no, the formula is written as Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃, which would mean one Cu in the hydroxide part and another Cu in the carbonate part. So total Cu per formula unit is 2.\n\nFor azurite: Cu(OH)₂·2CuCO₃. That would be 1 Cu in the hydroxide part and 2 Cu in the carbonate part, so total 3 Cu per formula unit.\n\nSo the mass fraction of Cu would be (mass of Cu in formula)/(total molar mass of formula).\n\nFor malachite (Cu₂(OH)₂CO3? Wait, the formula given is Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃. Let me check the actual formula. Wait, the formula given is Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃. Let me calculate the molar masses.\n\nLet me write both formulas properly.\n\nMalachite: Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃. Let's combine the formula. That would be Cu₂(OH)₂CO3. Because combining the two parts. So the formula is Cu₂(OH)₂CO3. The molar mass would be:\n\nCu: 63.55 g/mol × 2 = 127.1 g/mol\n\nO in OH: 16 × 2 = 32 g/mol (since there are two OH groups, each has 1 O and 1 H. Wait, but in the formula Cu₂(OH)₂CO3, the OH is part of the formula. Let me calculate the entire molar mass.\n\nCu₂(OH)₂CO3: Let's break it down:\n\nCopper: 2 × 63.55 = 127.1 g/mol\n\nO in OH: 2 × (16 + 1) = 2 × 17 = 34 g/mol (but actually, the OH group has O and H, but when calculating molar mass, we need to sum all atoms.\n\nWait, the formula is Cu₂(OH)₂CO3. So:\n\nCopper: 2 Cu\n\nHydroxide: 2 OH → 2 O and 2 H\n\nCarbonate: CO3 → 1 C, 3 O\n\nSo total:\n\nCu: 2 × 63.55 = 127.1 g/mol\n\nO: 2 (from OH) + 3 (from CO3) = 5 O? Wait, no. Wait, the OH groups contribute 2 O and 2 H. The CO3 contributes 3 O. So total O is 2 + 3 = 5 O.\n\nH: 2 H from OH.\n\nC: 1 C from CO3.\n\nSo molar mass is:\n\nCu: 127.1\n\nC: 12.01\n\nO: 5 × 16 = 80\n\nH: 2 × 1.008 = 2.016\n\nTotal molar mass = 127.1 + 12.01 + 80 + 2.016 ≈ 221.126 g/mol.\n\nMass of Cu is 127.1 g/mol. So mass fraction of Cu is 127.1 / 221.126 ≈ 0.575 or 57.5%.\n\nNow for azurite: Cu(OH)₂·2CuCO3. Let's write the formula as Cu3(OH)₂(CO3)₂. Let me confirm:\n\nOriginal formula is Cu(OH)₂·2CuCO3. So combining, that would be 1 Cu from the hydroxide and 2 Cu from the carbonate part, totaling 3 Cu. The hydroxide is 2 OH, and the carbonate is 2 CO3.\n\nSo formula is Cu3(OH)₂(CO3)₂.\n\nCalculating molar mass:\n\nCu: 3 × 63.55 = 190.65 g/mol\n\nO in OH: 2 O and 2 H\n\nO in CO3: 2 × 3 = 6 O\n\nCarbon: 2 × 12.01 = 24.02 g/mol\n\nHydrogen: 2 × 1.008 = 2.016 g/mol\n\nOxygen total: 2 (from OH) + 6 (from CO3) = 8 O → 8 × 16 = 128 g/mol\n\nSo total molar mass:\n\nCu: 190.65\n\nC: 24.02\n\nO: 128\n\nH: 2.016\n\nTotal ≈ 190.65 + 24.02 + 128 + 2.016 ≈ 344.686 g/mol.\n\nMass of Cu is 190.65 g/mol. So mass fraction is 190.65 / 344.686 ≈ 0.553 or 55.3%.\n\nSo comparing the two, the mass fraction of Cu in malachite (57.5%) is higher than in azurite (55.3%). Therefore, statement D is correct. So D is not the incorrect one.\n\nSo the incorrect statement would be C. Because if the pigments contain CuCO3 and Cu(OH)2, which are basic, they would react with acids. For example, acid rain could cause them to degrade. Similarly, in a very alkaline environment, maybe they would react as well, but perhaps they are more sensitive to acids. Therefore, statement C claims they are resistant to acid and alkali, which is incorrect. Hence, option C is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer is C.\n</think>"}
