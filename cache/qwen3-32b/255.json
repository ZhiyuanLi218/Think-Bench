The options are LiOH, CBr4, Mg(NO3)2, and AlCl3. Let me start by recalling what affects solubility. I remember that the common ion effect plays a role here. If a solution already has ions that are part of the salt, adding more of the same salt might decrease its solubility because of the common ion. On the other hand, if there's no common ion, the solubility might be higher.\n\nFirst, let me break down MgCl2. Magnesium chloride dissociates into Mg²+ and Cl⁻ ions when dissolved in water. So, MgCl2 → Mg²+ + 2Cl⁻. Now, I need to check each of the given solutions to see if they contain either Mg²+ or Cl⁻ ions.\n\nStarting with option A: LiOH(aq). Lithium hydroxide is a strong base, I think. It dissociates into Li+ and OH⁻ ions. So LiOH → Li+ + OH⁻. There's no Mg²+ or Cl⁻ here, so there's no common ion. Therefore, adding MgCl2 here shouldn't have a common ion effect. So the solubility might be normal. But wait, maybe the OH⁻ could react with Mg²+ to form Mg(OH)2, which is a precipitate. Since Mg(OH)2 is not very soluble, if MgCl2 is added to LiOH, the Mg²+ and OH⁻ might combine, causing precipitation. That would mean that MgCl2 isn't very soluble in LiOH because it forms a precipitate. So maybe A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: CBr4(aq). Carbon tetrabromide. Wait, is that soluble in water? Carbon tetrachloride isn't soluble in water, and similarly, carbon tetrabromide is probably a nonpolar molecule. Since MgCl2 is ionic and polar, it would dissolve in polar solvents. But CBr4 is nonpolar, so MgCl2 probably won't dissolve in it. So B is probably not the answer.\n\nOption C: Mg(NO3)2(aq). Magnesium nitrate. This dissociates into Mg²+ and NO3⁻. So Mg(NO3)2 → Mg²+ + 2NO3⁻. Here, Mg²+ is a common ion with MgCl2. So if we add MgCl2 to this solution, there's already Mg²+ present. According to the common ion effect, the presence of Mg²+ would shift the solubility equilibrium of MgCl2 to the left, decreasing its solubility. So MgCl2 would be less soluble here. Therefore, C is probably not the answer.\n\nOption D: AlCl3(aq). Aluminum chloride. This dissociates into Al³+ and Cl⁻ ions. AlCl3 → Al³+ + 3Cl⁻. Now, MgCl2 has Cl⁻ ions. So adding MgCl2 to AlCl3 solution would introduce more Cl⁻ ions. The common ion here is Cl⁻. The presence of Cl⁻ would affect the solubility of MgCl2. However, MgCl2 is already highly soluble in water. Wait, but if there's a lot of Cl⁻, would that decrease the solubility? Let me think. The solubility product (Ksp) for MgCl2 is very high, so even with some Cl⁻ present, maybe the effect is minimal. But compared to the other options, maybe D is better?\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about option A where Mg²+ and OH⁻ would form a precipitate. So in A, MgCl2 would have Mg²+ and Cl⁻, but the OH⁻ would react with Mg²+ to form Mg(OH)2, which is not very soluble. So in that case, adding MgCl2 to LiOH would cause precipitation, meaning that MgCl2 isn't soluble there. In contrast, in D, AlCl3 provides Cl⁻, but MgCl2's solubility is affected by the common ion Cl⁻. However, since MgCl2 is very soluble, maybe the decrease in solubility due to Cl⁻ isn't as significant as the precipitation in A. So perhaps D is better than A?\n\nBut wait, I need to compare all options. Let me recap:\n\n- A: LiOH provides OH⁻, which can precipitate Mg(OH)2. So solubility of MgCl2 is low here.\n\n- B: CBr4 is non-aqueous? Or is it aqueous? Wait, the question says \"solutions\", so all options are aqueous. But if CBr4 is a nonelectrolyte and not soluble in water, then the solution is not really aqueous. Wait, but the question says \"CBr4(aq)\", which implies that it's dissolved in water. However, carbon tetrabromide is a nonpolar molecule and likely doesn't dissolve well in water. Therefore, MgCl2, which is ionic, would not dissolve in a nonpolar solvent. So B is a bad choice.\n\n- C: Mg(NO3)2 has Mg²+ as a common ion, so solubility of MgCl2 is lower due to common ion effect.\n\n- D: AlCl3 has Cl⁻ as a common ion, so solubility of MgCl2 is lower, but maybe not as much as in C? Because MgCl2 has two Cl⁻ per formula unit. If AlCl3 provides Cl⁻, then adding MgCl2 would have more Cl⁻, but since AlCl3 has three Cl⁻ per formula unit, maybe the concentration of Cl⁻ is higher here?\n\nBut how does that affect the solubility? Let's think in terms of the solubility product. For MgCl2, the dissolution is:\n\nMgCl2(s) ⇌ Mg²+ + 2Cl⁻\n\nThe solubility product Ksp = [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2.\n\nIn pure water, the solubility is determined by this Ksp. If we add MgCl2 to a solution that already has some Cl⁻ (like in D), then the [Cl⁻] is higher, so the [Mg²+] must be lower to keep Ksp constant. Therefore, the solubility of MgCl2 decreases.\n\nSimilarly, in C, adding MgCl2 to Mg(NO3)2 solution, which has Mg²+ ions. The presence of Mg²+ would also decrease the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nBut between C and D, which common ion has a greater effect? Let's compare. The common ion effect depends on the concentration of the common ion. However, since all solutions are just given as solutions without concentrations, we can't know exact concentrations, but perhaps we can assume that the common ion effect is more significant when the common ion is from a higher valence? Or maybe not. Let's think about the stoichiometry.\n\nIn Mg(NO3)2, each formula unit gives 1 Mg²+ ion. In AlCl3, each formula unit gives 3 Cl⁻ ions. So if we have 1 M Mg(NO3)2, it gives 1 M Mg²+ and 2 M NO3⁻. If we have 1 M AlCl3, it gives 1 M Al³+ and 3 M Cl⁻. So when adding MgCl2 to these solutions, the existing ion concentration is higher for Cl⁻ in D than for Mg²+ in C? Wait, if the concentrations are the same, then for example, if both solutions are 1 M, then [Mg²+] in C is 1 M, and [Cl⁻] in D is 3 M. But how does that affect the solubility?\n\nLet me try to calculate the approximate solubility in each case.\n\nLet’s denote the solubility of MgCl2 as 's'. In pure water, the dissolution gives s mol/L of Mg²+ and 2s mol/L of Cl⁻. So Ksp = s*(2s)^2 = 4s³. Therefore, s = (Ksp/4)^(1/3).\n\nIn solution C (Mg(NO3)2), let's say the concentration of Mg²+ is 'c'. When adding MgCl2, the total [Mg²+] becomes c + s, and [Cl⁻] is 2s. Assuming that s is small compared to c (if c is large), then approximately:\n\nKsp ≈ c*(2s)^2 → s ≈ sqrt(Ksp/(4c)).\n\nSimilarly, in solution D (AlCl3), let's say the concentration of Cl⁻ is 'd'. When adding MgCl2, the total [Cl⁻] becomes d + 2s, and [Mg²+] is s. Assuming d >> 2s, then:\n\nKsp ≈ s*(d)^2 → s ≈ Ksp / d².\n\nNow, comparing the two expressions for s. In solution C, s is proportional to 1/sqrt(c), and in solution D, s is proportional to 1/d². Which is smaller? It depends on the values of c and d. If c and d are similar in magnitude, then 1/d² would be smaller than 1/sqrt(c) if d is similar to c. For example, if c = d = 1 M, then s in C is proportional to 1/sqrt(1) = 1, and in D, proportional to 1/(1)^2 = 1. But if c and d are different?\n\nBut in reality, if the solutions are all prepared at the same concentration (say 1 M), then for Mg(NO3)2, [Mg²+] = 1 M, and for AlCl3, [Cl⁻] = 3 M. Therefore, in solution D, the existing Cl⁻ concentration is higher than in solution C's existing Mg²+ concentration. So the solubility of MgCl2 would be lower in D than in C? Wait, no. Because in solution D, s ≈ Ksp / d². If d is 3 M (from 1 M AlCl3), then s ≈ Ksp / (3)^2 = Ksp /9. In solution C, s ≈ sqrt(Ksp/(4*1)) = sqrt(Ksp)/2. Which is larger?\n\nAssuming that Ksp is a constant. Let's plug in hypothetical numbers. Let's say Ksp is 1 (for simplicity). Then in solution C, s ≈ sqrt(1)/2 ≈ 0.5. In solution D, s ≈ 1/9 ≈ 0.11. Therefore, solubility is lower in D than in C. Wait, so that would mean that MgCl2 is less soluble in D than in C. But earlier I thought that in C, the common ion is Mg²+ and in D it's Cl⁻. But according to this, if the concentration of the common ion is higher in D (because AlCl3 gives 3 Cl⁻ per formula unit), then the solubility is lower in D. Therefore, between C and D, MgCl2 is less soluble in D. So then, which of the four options is the most soluble?\n\nEarlier analysis:\n\n- A: Precipitation due to Mg(OH)2, so very low solubility.\n\n- B: Nonpolar solvent, so very low solubility.\n\n- C: Common ion Mg²+, lower solubility than pure water.\n\n- D: Common ion Cl⁻, lower solubility than pure water, but maybe less than in C?\n\nWait, according to the calculation above, in solution C, if the existing Mg²+ is 1 M, solubility is ~0.5 (hypothetically), while in solution D with existing Cl⁻ 3 M, solubility is ~0.11. So D is worse (lower solubility) than C. Therefore, between the four options, the solubility would be highest in which one?\n\nThe question is asking which solution would have MgCl2 most soluble. The options are A, B, C, D. So the best option would be the one with the least common ion effect or no common ion effect.\n\nA has no common ion but causes precipitation. So even though there's no common ion, the Mg²+ and OH⁻ form a precipitate, making MgCl2 less soluble.\n\nB is nonpolar, so very low solubility.\n\nC has common ion Mg²+.\n\nD has common ion Cl⁻.\n\nSo between these, which is the most soluble? The answer would be the one where the common ion effect is least, or where precipitation is not happening.\n\nIf A causes precipitation, then solubility is very low. If B is nonpolar, also very low. Between C and D, which has lower solubility? As per the previous hypothetical, D has lower solubility than C. Therefore, the order of solubility would be:\n\nMost soluble: ??? Wait, the question is which solution would have MgCl2 most soluble. The options are all solutions where MgCl2 is added. So we need to pick the solution where adding MgCl2 would result in the highest solubility.\n\nThe only solution without common ions is... none of them. A has no common ion (LiOH gives Li+ and OH-), but causes precipitation. B is nonpolar. So the only solutions with common ions are C and D. If between C and D, solubility is lower in D than in C, then the solubility in C is lower than in pure water, but higher than in D. However, the question is which of the four options is the most soluble. So if in pure water solubility is higher than in C and D, but the options don't include pure water. Therefore, among the given options, which is the best?\n\nWait, but the options are all solutions where MgCl2 is added. So the answer is the one where the common ion effect is least, or where precipitation is avoided. Since A causes precipitation, and B is nonpolar, the only possible candidates are C and D. But earlier calculation suggested that D has lower solubility than C. So then the most soluble would be in C? But that seems counterintuitive. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me re-examine the solubility expressions.\n\nIn solution C (Mg²+ common ion):\n\nMgCl2(s) ⇌ Mg²+ + 2Cl⁻\n\nInitial concentrations:\n\n[Mg²+] = c (from Mg(NO3)2)\n\n[Cl⁻] = 0\n\nChange:\n\n[Mg²+] increases by s → c + s\n\n[Cl⁻] increases by 2s → 0 + 2s\n\nKsp = (c + s)(2s)^2\n\nAssuming s << c, then c + s ≈ c. So:\n\nKsp ≈ c*(2s)^2 → s ≈ sqrt(Ksp/(4c))\n\nIn solution D (Cl⁻ common ion):\n\nMgCl2(s) ⇌ Mg²+ + 2Cl⁻\n\nInitial concentrations:\n\n[Mg²+] = 0\n\n[Cl⁻] = d (from AlCl3)\n\nChange:\n\n[Mg²+] increases by s → 0 + s\n\n[Cl⁻] increases by 2s → d + 2s\n\nKsp = (s)(d + 2s)^2\n\nAssuming d >> 2s, then d + 2s ≈ d. So:\n\nKsp ≈ s*d² → s ≈ Ksp / d²\n\nNow, comparing the two expressions for s. Let's say that in both cases, the concentration of the common ion is the same. For example, if in solution C, c = 1 M, and in solution D, d = 1 M. Then:\n\ns_C ≈ sqrt(Ksp/(4*1)) = sqrt(Ksp)/2\n\ns_D ≈ Ksp / 1² = Ksp\n\nSo if Ksp is a constant, then s_D would be much larger than s_C if Ksp is large. Wait, but MgCl2 is very soluble. Wait, actually, MgCl2 is highly soluble in water, so its solubility isn't governed by a Ksp like sparingly soluble salts. Wait, this might be a key point I missed. MgCl2 is actually a very soluble salt, so its solubility isn't limited by a solubility product in the same way as, say, Mg(OH)2. Instead, when we talk about the common ion effect for highly soluble salts, the effect is minimal because the solution can accommodate more ions without reaching saturation. Therefore, perhaps the common ion effect isn't significant here, and the solubility remains high.\n\nBut wait, the question is about which solution would have MgCl2 most soluble. If all the options are aqueous solutions, then MgCl2 is already very soluble, but adding it to a solution with common ions would slightly decrease its solubility. However, since MgCl2 is so soluble, maybe the decrease is negligible. However, the question is still which of these four solutions would have the highest solubility. So among the four, which has the least common ion effect?\n\nLet me think again. If MgCl2 is added to:\n\nA: LiOH, which can form Mg(OH)2 precipitate. So adding MgCl2 to LiOH would cause precipitation of Mg(OH)2, meaning that the solubility of MgCl2 is limited by the solubility of Mg(OH)2. Therefore, the solubility of MgCl2 in LiOH solution would be very low because it's forming a precipitate.\n\nB: CBr4 is nonpolar, so MgCl2, being ionic, won't dissolve in it. So solubility is very low.\n\nC: Mg(NO3)2 has Mg²+ as a common ion. The presence of Mg²+ would decrease the solubility of MgCl2 slightly, but since MgCl2 is already very soluble, maybe the decrease is not too much.\n\nD: AlCl3 has Cl⁻ as a common ion. Similarly, presence of Cl⁻ would decrease solubility slightly.\n\nSo between C and D, which has a greater common ion effect? If the concentration of the common ion is higher in one of them, that would have a greater effect. For example, if we have 1 M Mg(NO3)2, then [Mg²+] = 1 M. If we have 1 M AlCl3, then [Cl⁻] = 3 M. Since the Cl⁻ concentration is higher in D, the common ion effect would be more significant there, leading to a greater decrease in solubility. Therefore, between C and D, MgCl2 is more soluble in C than in D. Therefore, among all options, the most soluble would be in C? No, wait—if the common ion effect is less in C than in D, then solubility is higher in C than in D. But compared to pure water, both C and D have lower solubility. However, the question is which of the four options is the most soluble. Since A and B are much worse, the answer would be between C and D. And since C has less common ion effect than D, then the answer is C?\n\nWait, but I'm confused because I thought earlier that the common ion effect in D is greater because of higher Cl⁻ concentration. If that's the case, then solubility is lower in D, so higher in C. Therefore, among the four options, the most soluble would be in C? But that seems odd because adding MgCl2 to a solution that already has Mg²+ would decrease solubility. But compared to adding it to a solution with Cl⁻, which has a higher common ion concentration, so the decrease is more in D. Therefore, C is better than D. So the order of solubility would be: C > D > ... but A and B are much lower. So the answer would be C?\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. If I add MgCl2 to Mg(NO3)2 solution, which already has Mg²+, the solubility decreases. But since MgCl2 is very soluble, maybe the decrease isn't significant. However, the question is which of the four options is the most soluble. So if C and D both decrease solubility, but C's decrease is less than D's, then the most soluble is C. Therefore, the answer is C? But I need to check if there's another factor I'm missing.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that MgCl2's solubility is governed by a solubility product. In reality, MgCl2 is highly soluble, so when you add it to water, it dissolves completely. However, when you add it to a solution with common ions, the solubility is still high, but slightly less. But in the case of option A, adding MgCl2 to LiOH, the Mg²+ and OH⁻ would form Mg(OH)2, which is not very soluble. The solubility product of Mg(OH)2 is Ksp = [Mg²+][OH⁻]^2. If the solution has excess OH⁻ from LiOH, then the [OH⁻] is high, so [Mg²+] must be low to satisfy Ksp. Therefore, the amount of Mg²+ that can stay in solution is limited, so adding MgCl2 would result in precipitation of Mg(OH)2, making the solubility of MgCl2 very low in LiOH. Therefore, option A is a bad choice.\n\nTherefore, the best option is between C and D. Since in C, the common ion is Mg²+, and in D it's Cl⁻. Which common ion has a greater effect? As discussed earlier, if the concentration of the common ion is higher in D (because AlCl3 provides 3 Cl⁻ per formula unit), then the common ion effect is stronger in D, making solubility lower there. Therefore, between C and D, C is better (higher solubility), so the answer is C? But wait, that seems contradictory to the earlier thought that common ion effect in C would decrease solubility. But if the decrease is less in C than in D, then C is better.\n\nBut another way to think about it: if you have two solutions, one with Mg²+ and one with Cl⁻, and you add MgCl2 to both, which one will have more dissolved MgCl2? Since MgCl2 provides both Mg²+ and Cl⁻, the solution that has fewer of those ions already will allow more dissolution. Since Mg(NO3)2 has Mg²+ but no Cl⁻, and AlCl3 has Cl⁻ but no Mg²+, adding MgCl2 to Mg(NO3)2 will increase Cl⁻, and adding to AlCl3 will increase Mg²+. But since MgCl2 has two Cl⁻ per formula unit, maybe the Cl⁻ concentration increases more in D than Mg²+ in C?\n\nWait, but the question is about which solution would have MgCl2 most soluble. If we assume that all solutions are 1 M, then:\n\n- In 1 M Mg(NO3)2: [Mg²+] = 1 M, [NO3⁻] = 2 M. Adding MgCl2 would add Mg²+ and Cl⁻.\n\n- In 1 M AlCl3: [Al³+] = 1 M, [Cl⁻] = 3 M. Adding MgCl2 would add Mg²+ and Cl⁻.\n\nThe solubility of MgCl2 is limited by the common ion effect. In solution C, the common ion is Mg²+; in solution D, it's Cl⁻. Which effect is stronger?\n\nFor solution C: The presence of Mg²+ reduces the solubility of MgCl2. For solution D: The presence of Cl⁻ reduces the solubility. Which reduction is greater?\n\nSince the stoichiometry of MgCl2 is 1 Mg²+ to 2 Cl⁻, the concentration of Cl⁻ is double that of Mg²+ when dissolved. If the existing Cl⁻ is 3 M (from AlCl3), then when adding MgCl2, the [Cl⁻] becomes 3 + 2s. If existing Mg²+ is 1 M (from Mg(NO3)2), then when adding MgCl2, the [Mg²+] becomes 1 + s.\n\nAssuming that the solubility s is small compared to the existing concentrations (which might not be true for highly soluble salts), then:\n\nFor solution C: Ksp ≈ (1)(2s)^2 = 4s² → s ≈ sqrt(Ksp/4)\n\nFor solution D: Ksp ≈ (s)(3)^2 = 9s → s ≈ Ksp/9\n\nIf Ksp is large, then both s values would be large, but comparing the two expressions:\n\nIf Ksp is large, then in solution C, s ≈ sqrt(Ksp)/2, and in D, s ≈ Ksp/9. Which is larger? Let's assume Ksp is, say, 100 (hypothetically). Then in C: s ≈ 10/2 = 5. In D: s ≈ 100/9 ≈ 11. So in this case, s is larger in D, meaning solubility is higher in D. But this contradicts the previous conclusion. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, here I assumed that in solution C, the existing Mg²+ is 1 M, and in solution D, existing Cl⁻ is 3 M. But for solution C, the Ksp expression would actually be:\n\nKsp = [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2 = (1 + s)(2s)^2 ≈ 1*(2s)^2 = 4s² → s ≈ sqrt(Ksp/4)\n\nFor solution D: Ksp = [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2 = (s)(3 + 2s)^2 ≈ s*(3)^2 = 9s → s ≈ Ksp/9\n\nIf Ksp is large, then in solution C, s is proportional to sqrt(Ksp), while in solution D, it's proportional to Ksp. Since Ksp is large, Ksp grows faster than sqrt(Ksp), so s in D would be much larger. Therefore, solubility is higher in D. This contradicts the earlier conclusion. What's the issue here?\n\nThe problem is that MgCl2 is actually a highly soluble salt, so the assumption that s is small compared to existing concentrations might not hold. For example, if MgCl2 is very soluble, then adding it to a solution with existing ions might not significantly change the concentration of those ions. Therefore, the approximations [Mg²+] ≈ 1 and [Cl⁻] ≈ 3 might not be valid, and we can't make the simplifications.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the common ion effect isn't significant for highly soluble salts like MgCl2, and the solubility remains high in both C and D. But then why would the question ask this? There must be a way to determine which one is better.\n\nAnother angle: the activity of the ions. In solutions with high ionic strength, the activity coefficients decrease, which might affect solubility. But this is more advanced and probably beyond the scope of the question.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in solution C (Mg(NO3)2), adding MgCl2 introduces Cl⁻ ions. In solution D (AlCl3), adding MgCl2 introduces Mg²+ ions. Which of these would be more affected by the common ion?\n\nSince MgCl2 provides two Cl⁻ per formula unit, adding it to AlCl3 (which already has Cl⁻) would significantly increase the Cl⁻ concentration. Whereas adding MgCl2 to Mg(NO3)2 would increase the Mg²+ concentration. But since MgCl2 has a 1:2 ratio, the Cl⁻ increase is double the Mg²+ increase.\n\nBut how does this affect solubility? The solubility product is [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2. If we add MgCl2 to a solution that already has some Mg²+ or Cl⁻, the product [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2 must remain equal to Ksp.\n\nLet me think of it in terms of the reaction quotient. If we add MgCl2 to a solution with existing ions, the reaction quotient Q would be [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2. If Q is less than Ksp, more MgCl2 can dissolve. If Q is greater, precipitation occurs.\n\nBut since MgCl2 is very soluble, its dissolution would proceed until Q reaches Ksp. However, in solutions with existing ions, Q might already be higher, limiting the amount that can dissolve.\n\nFor example, in solution C (Mg(NO3)2), if there's already 1 M Mg²+ and 0 Cl⁻, adding MgCl2 would increase both Mg²+ and Cl⁻. The Q would be (1 + s)(2s)^2. To reach Ksp, this must equal Ksp. If Ksp is large, then s can be large.\n\nIn solution D (AlCl3), if there's already 3 M Cl⁻ and 0 Mg²+, adding MgCl2 would increase Mg²+ and Cl⁻. The Q would be (s)(3 + 2s)^2. Again, for large Ksp, s can be large.\n\nBut comparing the two, which one allows for a larger s? It depends on the values. If we set Q = Ksp for both and solve for s, it's complex without knowing Ksp. However, since MgCl2 is very soluble, its Ksp is extremely large, so both s values would be large, but which is larger?\n\nLet's take a real Ksp value for MgCl2. Wait, actually, MgCl2 is so soluble that it's not typically described by a solubility product in the same way as sparingly soluble salts. Instead, its solubility is considered to be essentially complete in water. However, when adding it to a solution with common ions, the solubility would still decrease slightly due to the common ion effect.\n\nBut since the question is about which solution would have the highest solubility, and given that in option A there's precipitation due to Mg(OH)2, and in B it's nonpolar, the answer must be between C and D.\n\nGiven that in D, the existing Cl⁻ concentration is higher (3 M from 1 M AlCl3), and the common ion effect for Cl⁻ would be stronger than for Mg²+ in C (1 M from 1 M Mg(NO3)2), then the solubility of MgCl2 would be lower in D than in C. Therefore, the most soluble would be in C.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the hypothetical with Ksp=100, I found that in C, s=5 and in D, s=11, implying higher solubility in D. But this was under the assumption that existing concentrations are much larger than s, which may not hold for highly soluble salts. If s is large, then the approximations break down.\n\nLet me try with actual numbers. Let's say Ksp is 1000 (hypothetically very high).\n\nFor solution C: Q = (1 + s)(2s)^2 = 1000\n\nAssume s is large, so 1 + s ≈ s, and 2s is large. Then approximately:\n\ns*(2s)^2 = 4s³ = 1000 → s ≈ cube root(250) ≈ 6.3\n\nFor solution D: Q = s*(3 + 2s)^2 = 1000\n\nAssume s is large, so 3 + 2s ≈ 2s. Then:\n\ns*(2s)^2 = 4s³ = 1000 → s ≈ 6.3 as well.\n\nSo in this case, both solutions give the same solubility. But this is under the assumption that s is large, making the existing concentrations negligible. However, if the existing concentrations are not negligible, then the results differ.\n\nIf we don't make the approximation, let's solve for solution C with Ksp=1000:\n\n(1 + s)(2s)^2 = 1000\n\nLet's try s=6.3:\n\n(1 + 6.3)*(2*6.3)^2 = 7.3*(12.6)^2 ≈ 7.3*158.76 ≈ 1158, which is greater than 1000. So s needs to be smaller. Let's try s=5:\n\n(1 + 5)*(10)^2 = 6*100 = 600 < 1000. s=6: 7*12²=7*144=1008 ≈ 1000. So s≈6. So in this case, with existing Mg²+ of 1 M, s≈6.\n\nFor solution D with Ksp=1000:\n\ns*(3 + 2s)^2 = 1000\n\nLet's try s=6: 6*(3 + 12)^2 = 6*(15)^2 = 6*225=1350 >1000. Try s=5: 5*(3 + 10)^2 = 5*169=845 <1000. Try s=5.5: 5.5*(3 + 11)^2=5.5*(14)^2=5.5*196=1078 >1000. Try s=5.3: 5.3*(3 + 10.6)^2=5.3*(13.6)^2≈5.3*184.96≈979. Which is close to 1000. So s≈5.3.\n\nSo in this case, solubility in solution C is about 6, and in D about 5.3. Therefore, solubility is higher in C than in D. This suggests that even with a very high Ksp, the solubility is slightly higher in C than in D. Therefore, between C and D, the most soluble is C.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, the answer is C: Mg(NO3)2(aq)? Wait, but that seems odd because adding MgCl2 to a solution with Mg²+ would decrease its solubility. But according to this calculation, it's slightly higher than in D. But why?\n\nBecause in solution D, the existing Cl⁻ concentration is higher (3 M vs 1 M Mg²+ in C), and since the Cl⁻ is squared in the Ksp expression, its effect is more pronounced. Therefore, even though both have common ions, the effect is stronger in D, leading to lower solubility there. Hence, the most soluble is C.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive. Let me check with another example. Suppose we have 0.1 M Mg(NO3)2 and 0.1 M AlCl3.\n\nFor solution C (0.1 M Mg²+):\n\nQ = (0.1 + s)(2s)^2 = Ksp\n\nFor solution D (0.3 M Cl⁻):\n\nQ = s*(0.3 + 2s)^2 = Ksp\n\nAgain, with Ksp=1000.\n\nFor solution C, solving (0.1 + s)(4s²) = 1000. Let's assume s is large, so 0.1 + s ≈ s. Then 4s³ ≈ 1000 → s ≈ 6.3, as before.\n\nFor solution D, solving s*(0.3 + 2s)^2 = 1000. If s is large, 0.3 + 2s ≈ 2s, so s*(2s)^2 = 4s³ ≈ 1000 → s ≈ 6.3. But with lower concentrations, let's see:\n\nIf we take s=6.3, then for solution D: 6.3*(0.3 + 12.6)^2 = 6.3*(12.9)^2 ≈ 6.3*166.41 ≈ 1048, which is close to 1000. So similar to before, the solubility is slightly less in D than in C due to the existing 0.3 M Cl⁻. Therefore, the trend holds: solubility is higher in C than in D.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that between C and D, MgCl2 is more soluble in C. Since A and B are much worse, the answer is C.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the most soluble. If C has lower solubility than pure water, but higher than D, then C is the best among the options. So the answer is C?\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA: LiOH(aq) - causes precipitation, very low solubility.\n\nB: CBr4(aq) - nonpolar, very low solubility.\n\nC: Mg(NO3)2(aq) - some decrease in solubility due to Mg²+.\n\nD: AlCl3(aq) - more decrease in solubility due to Cl⁻.\n\nTherefore, the most soluble would be in C.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because I initially thought the answer might be D, but after calculations, it's C. Let me verify with another approach.\n\nAnother way: the solubility of a salt is decreased by the presence of a common ion. The extent of decrease depends on the concentration of the common ion. Since AlCl3 provides more Cl⁻ per formula unit, the common ion concentration is higher, leading to a greater decrease in solubility. Hence, between C and D, D has a greater common ion effect, making solubility lower in D. Therefore, the most soluble is C.\n\nYes, this makes sense. So the correct answer is C: Mg(NO3)2(aq)? Wait, but wait, Mg(NO3)2 has Mg²+ as the common ion. Adding MgCl2 to it would add Cl⁻. But since MgCl2 is already providing both Mg²+ and Cl⁻, the existing Mg²+ in solution C would mean that adding MgCl2 would mainly add Cl⁻, while in solution D, adding MgCl2 would mainly add Mg²+. Since the Cl⁻ concentration is squared in the Ksp expression, the effect of Cl⁻ is more significant. Hence, adding to a solution with Cl⁻ (D) would have a greater effect on decreasing solubility than adding to a solution with Mg²+ (C). Therefore, the most soluble is C.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial intuition, but calculations support it. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because usually, when you have a salt with multiple ions, the common ion with higher concentration or higher stoichiometry has a greater effect. Since MgCl2 has two Cl⁻ per formula unit, the presence of Cl⁻ in solution D would have a more pronounced effect because the Cl⁻ concentration is squared in the Ksp expression. Hence, even though AlCl3 provides three Cl⁻, the effect on solubility is greater than the effect of Mg²+ from Mg(NO3)2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Mg(NO3)2(aq).\n\nWait, but wait, the options are:\n\nA: LiOH(aq)\n\nB: CBr4(aq)\n\nC: Mg(NO3)2(aq)\n\nD: AlCl3(aq)\n\nSo the correct answer is C? But I need to make sure.\n\nLet me check with actual solubility product values. Wait, MgCl2 is actually very soluble in water (about 54.3 g/100 mL at 20°C), so its solubility is not limited by a solubility product in the traditional sense. However, when added to a solution with common ions, the solubility would still decrease slightly. But since the question is about which solution would have the highest solubility, and given the options, the best choice is the one with the least common ion effect, which is C (Mg(NO3)2) compared to D (AlCl3), because the common ion effect is less in C.\n\nYes, I think this is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, another angle: the presence of Mg²+ in solution C would mean that when you add MgCl2, you're adding more Mg²+ and Cl⁻. However, since Mg(NO3)2 is already dissociated into Mg²+ and NO3⁻, and MgCl2 adds Cl⁻, the main common ion here is Mg²+ from the solution, but the added salt provides Cl⁻. In contrast, in D, the solution has Cl⁻, and the added salt provides Mg²+. Since the Ksp expression is [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2, the effect of increasing [Cl⁻] (which is squared) is more significant than increasing [Mg²+]. Therefore, adding MgCl2 to a solution with existing Cl⁻ (D) would cause a greater decrease in solubility than adding it to a solution with existing Mg²+ (C). Hence, the most soluble is C.\n\nYes, this makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Mg(NO3)2(aq).\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because I initially thought the answer might be D, but after careful analysis, it's C. To confirm, let me think of another example. Suppose I have NaCl and I want to know where it's more soluble: in NaNO3 solution or in KCl solution. Since NaCl has Na+ and Cl⁻, adding to NaNO3 (common ion Na+) or KCl (common ion Cl⁻). The solubility would be lower in KCl because the common ion Cl⁻ is squared in the Ksp expression (for a 1:1 salt, it's [Na+][Cl⁻], so both ions are first power). But for MgCl2, it's [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2, so the Cl⁻ effect is more significant. Therefore, adding to a solution with Cl⁻ would have a greater effect. Hence, MgCl2 is more soluble in Mg(NO3)2 solution (C) than in AlCl3 solution (D). Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nYes, this makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
