Let's evaluate each one systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Option A: \"Sodium silicate is an insoluble silicate in water\"**  \nThis statement is **incorrect**. Sodium silicate, commonly referred to as \"water glass,\" is actually **soluble in water**. It is widely used in various industrial applications due to its solubility and its ability to form gels and adhesives when mixed with water. Therefore, the claim that it is \"insoluble\" is false.\n\n---\n\n**Option B: \"Magnesium burns in air to produce magnesium oxide and magnesium nitride\"**  \nThis statement is **correct**. Magnesium reacts with oxygen in the air to form **magnesium oxide (MgO)** and with nitrogen to form **magnesium nitride (Mg₃N₂)**. The resulting product is a mixture of both compounds when magnesium burns in air.\n\n---\n\n**Option C: \"Sodium reacts with water to generate sodium hydroxide and hydrogen\"**  \nThis statement is **correct**. The reaction between sodium and water is well-known and exothermic. It produces **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**, **hydrogen gas (H₂)**, and heat. The balanced equation is:\n\n$$\n2\\text{Na} + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NaOH} + \\text{H}_2\\uparrow + \\text{heat}\n$$\n\n---\n\n**Option D: \"At room temperature, aluminum becomes passivated when exposed to concentrated nitric acid or concentrated sulfuric acid\"**  \nThis statement is **correct**. When aluminum comes into contact with concentrated **nitric acid (HNO₃)** or **sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)**, a thin, protective **aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃)** layer forms on its surface. This layer prevents further reaction and is referred to as **passivation**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which of the given statements is incorrect. The options are A to D. I need to figure out which one is wrong.\n\nStarting with option A: Sodium silicate is an insoluble silicate in water. Hmm. I remember that sodium silicate is actually soluble in water. It's commonly known as water glass, right? So if it's called water glass, that suggests it dissolves in water. So statement A says it's insoluble, which would be incorrect. But let me check the other options just in case.\n\nOption B: Magnesium burns in air to produce magnesium oxide and magnesium nitride. Yes, magnesium reacts with oxygen to form MgO and with nitrogen to form Mg3N2. So when it burns in air, which has both O2 and N2, both products are formed. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: Sodium reacts with water to generate sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. Yes, sodium reacts vigorously with water to form NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. The reaction is 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2↑ + heat. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: At room temperature, aluminum becomes passivated when exposed to concentrated nitric acid or concentrated sulfuric acid. Passivation is when a metal forms a protective oxide layer that prevents further reaction. I recall that concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 can passivate aluminum by forming a thin oxide layer. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is A. Sodium silicate is actually soluble in water, so saying it's insoluble is wrong. So the answer should be A.\n</think>"}
