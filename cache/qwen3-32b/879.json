Let me break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out the proper divisors of 284, add them up, and then find the proper divisors of that resulting sum and add those up as well. Let me start with the first part: finding the proper divisors of 284.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder, and it's less than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. So, for 284, I need to find all numbers less than 284 that divide 284 evenly.\n\nTo do this systematically, maybe I should factorize 284 into its prime factors. Prime factorization can help in determining all the divisors. Let me try dividing 284 by small primes. \n\nFirst, check if it's even. 284 divided by 2 is 142. So, 2 is a prime factor. Then divide 142 by 2 again: 142 divided by 2 is 71. Now, 71 is a prime number, right? Let me check. 71 isn't divisible by 2, 3 (7+1=8, not divisible by 3), 5 (ends with 1), 7? 7*10=70, 71-70=1, so no. 11? 11*6=66, 11*7=77, which is too big. So yeah, 71 is prime. Therefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2² × 71¹.\n\nNow, using the prime factorization, I can find all the divisors. The formula for the number of divisors is (exponent + 1) for each prime factor and multiply them. But here, I need the actual divisors. For exponents of 2² and 71¹, the divisors are generated by taking exponents from 0 up to their maximum for each prime.\n\nSo, for 2², exponents can be 0, 1, 2. For 71¹, exponents can be 0, 1. Therefore, all divisors are:\n\n2⁰×71⁰ = 1\n\n2¹×71⁰ = 2\n\n2²×71⁰ = 4\n\n2⁰×71¹ = 71\n\n2¹×71¹ = 2×71=142\n\n2²×71¹ = 4×71=284\n\nSo, the divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284. But proper divisors are those less than 284. Therefore, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nLet me check that. 1 divides everything. 2 divides 284, as we saw. 4 divides 284, yes. 71 divides 284, and half of 284 is 142, so 142 is also a divisor. So those are all the proper divisors. Now, let me add them up.\n\nCalculating the sum: 1 + 2 is 3, plus 4 is 7, plus 71 is 78, plus 142. Let me do that step by step. 78 + 142. 70 + 140 is 210, and 8 + 2 is 10, so total is 220. Wait, 78 + 142. Let me check again. 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142. Let me add them in another order. 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 71 = 78, 78 + 142. 78 + 142. 78 + 100 is 178, plus 42 is 220. Yes, so the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. So now I need to find all proper divisors of 220 and add them up.\n\nAgain, let's start by prime factorizing 220. 220 is an even number, so divide by 2: 220 / 2 = 110. Divide by 2 again: 110 / 2 = 55. Now, 55 is 5 × 11. So the prime factors are 2² × 5¹ × 11¹.\n\nSo, prime factorization is 2² × 5 × 11. Now, to find all divisors, we can use the exponents. For 2², exponents 0,1,2; for 5¹, exponents 0,1; for 11¹, exponents 0,1. Therefore, the divisors can be generated by multiplying combinations of these primes.\n\nBut maybe instead of listing all divisors, there is a formula for the sum of divisors? Yes, the formula for the sum of all divisors is (p₁⁰ + p₁¹ + ... + p₁^a) × ... × (p_n⁰ + p_n¹ + ... + p_n^b) for each prime factor. Then, since we need the sum of proper divisors, we subtract the number itself.\n\nBut maybe I can use this formula here. Let me recall. The sum of all divisors of N is σ(N). Then, the sum of proper divisors is σ(N) - N.\n\nSo, if I can compute σ(220), then subtract 220, that will give me the sum of proper divisors of 220.\n\nLet me compute σ(220). Given that 220 factors into 2² × 5¹ × 11¹, then:\n\nσ(220) = σ(2²) × σ(5¹) × σ(11¹)\n\nCalculating each part:\n\nσ(2²) is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\nσ(5¹) is 1 + 5 = 6\n\nσ(11¹) is 1 + 11 = 12\n\nMultiply them all together: 7 × 6 × 12. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 7 × 6 is 42. Then, 42 × 12. 40 × 12 = 480, 2 × 12 = 24, so total is 480 + 24 = 504. Therefore, σ(220) = 504. Therefore, the sum of proper divisors of 220 is 504 - 220 = 284.\n\nWait, so the sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284? That seems interesting because we started with 284, whose proper divisors summed to 220. So, they are amicable numbers! 220 and 284 are an amicable pair. That's a known pair, I think. So, if that's the case, then the sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284. But the question is asking for the sum of the proper divisors of that sum. Wait, so first sum was 220, then sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284. But then we need the sum of proper divisors of that sum, which is 284 again. Wait, but we already calculated the sum of proper divisors of 284 as 220. So then, if we take the sum of proper divisors of 284, which is 220, then take the sum of proper divisors of 220, which is 284, then take the sum of proper divisors of 284 again... Wait, but the question is only asking for two layers: sum of proper divisors of 284, then sum of proper divisors of that sum.\n\nWait, let me check the original question again: \"What is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284?\" So first compute sum of proper divisors of 284, which is 220, then compute sum of proper divisors of 220, which is 284. Therefore, the answer would be 284? But let me verify this because maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me recast this. First step: sum of proper divisors of 284 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220. Correct. Then, sum of proper divisors of 220. Let me recalculate that manually, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake with the formula.\n\nSo, 220. Let's find all its proper divisors. First, prime factors are 2² × 5 × 11. So divisors can be found by multiplying combinations of these primes. Let me list them:\n\nStart with 1.\n\nThen primes: 2, 5, 11.\n\nThen products of two primes: 2×2=4, 2×5=10, 2×11=22, 5×11=55.\n\nThen products of three primes: 2×2×5=20, 2×2×11=44, 2×5×11=110.\n\nThen the product of all four primes (but note that 2² × 5 × 11 is 220 itself, which is not a proper divisor).\n\nSo all divisors are:\n\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, and 220. Therefore, the proper divisors exclude 220, so they are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110.\n\nLet me add them up. Let me do this step by step:\n\nStart adding:\n\n1 + 2 = 3\n\n3 + 4 = 7\n\n7 + 5 = 12\n\n12 + 10 = 22\n\n22 + 11 = 33\n\n33 + 20 = 53\n\n53 + 22 = 75\n\n75 + 44 = 119\n\n119 + 55 = 174\n\n174 + 110 = 284.\n\nYes! So the sum of proper divisors of 220 is indeed 284. Therefore, the answer to the original question is 284. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nOriginal question: sum of proper divisors of sum of proper divisors of 284. Sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220. Sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284. Therefore, the answer is 284. But let me check once more if there is a miscalculation here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another approach. For example, since we know that 220 and 284 are amicable pairs, meaning that sum of proper divisors of each is equal to the other. Therefore, if we take sum of proper divisors of 284, it is 220, and then sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284. Therefore, the answer is 284.\n\nBut let me check if there's a trick here. For example, maybe the question is trying to lead me into a loop? Like if I have to do it again? But no, the question specifically says \"the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284\", which is two layers. So first layer: sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220. Second layer: sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284. Therefore, answer is 284. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if there's a miscalculation in the first step? Let me check again the sum of proper divisors of 284. The proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142. Adding them: 1 + 2 is 3, plus 4 is 7, plus 71 is 78, plus 142 is 220. Correct. So that's right.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 284. But let me check once more for the second step. The proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110. Adding them up again:\n\nLet me group them:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110.\n\nGroup them as (1 + 2 + 4) + (5 + 10 + 11) + (20 + 22) + (44 + 55) + 110.\n\nCalculating each group:\n\n1+2+4 = 7\n\n5+10+11 = 26\n\n20+22 = 42\n\n44+55 = 99\n\nThen add 110.\n\nSo total is 7 + 26 = 33, 33 + 42 = 75, 75 + 99 = 174, 174 + 110 = 284. Yep, same result. Therefore, the answer is indeed 284.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 284. But wait, that seems a bit circular. But since 220 and 284 are amicable numbers, this is their defining property. So it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone isn't familiar with amicable numbers, they might have to go through the calculation, which I did, and arrive at the same conclusion. So I think this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 284.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is \\boxed{284}.\n</think>"}
