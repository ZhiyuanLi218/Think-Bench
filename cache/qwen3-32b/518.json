Both have different Lorentz factors, and the photons end up going in upper-right and lower-right directions. The key here is that their energies are the same. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some physics. When an electron and a positron annihilate, they produce two photons to conserve momentum and energy. In the center-of-momentum frame, the photons are emitted in opposite directions. However, since the electron and positron here are moving with different Lorentz factors, the center-of-momentum frame isn't the lab frame. So the photons' directions might not be directly opposite in the lab frame. But the problem states that the energies of both photons are the same. That's interesting because usually, in asymmetric collisions, the photons might have different energies. But here they have the same energy. So maybe the frame of reference here is such that the total momentum is zero? Wait, but if the electron and positron have different Lorentz factors, their momenta might not be equal and opposite. So perhaps the collision isn't in the center-of-momentum frame? But the photons still have equal energy. That must mean that the total momentum of the system is zero in some frame? Hmm, maybe I need to analyze this in the lab frame or find the center-of-momentum frame.\n\nLet me start by calculating the velocities of the electron and positron. The Lorentz factor γ is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. The Lorentz factor is defined as γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can find their velocities.\n\nFor the electron (moving to the right, let's say positive x-direction):\n\nγ_e = 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²)\n\nSo sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²) = 1/4\n\nSquaring both sides: 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/16\n\nTherefore, v_e²/c² = 15/16 => v_e = c * sqrt(15)/4 ≈ c * 0.9682\n\nSimilarly for the positron (moving to the left, so negative x-direction):\n\nγ_p = 2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²)\n\nsqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) = 1/2\n\nSquaring: 1 - v_p²/c² = 1/4 => v_p²/c² = 3/4 => v_p = c * sqrt(3)/2 ≈ c * 0.8660\n\nSo the electron is moving faster than the positron in the lab frame. Now, the total momentum of the system before collision is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Let's compute that.\n\nMomentum of a relativistic particle is γmv. Since the electron and positron have the same mass, but opposite charges, but their masses are the same. Let me denote m as the mass of the electron/positron.\n\nMomentum of electron (to the right): p_e = γ_e * m * v_e\n\nMomentum of positron (to the left): p_p = γ_p * m * v_p, but since it's moving to the left, it's -γ_p * m * v_p in the x-direction.\n\nSo total momentum P_total = p_e - p_p.\n\nLet me compute p_e and p_p.\n\nFirst, let's compute p_e:\n\nγ_e = 4, v_e = c*sqrt(15)/4.\n\nSo p_e = 4 * m * c * sqrt(15)/4 = m c sqrt(15)\n\nSimilarly, p_p:\n\nγ_p = 2, v_p = c*sqrt(3)/2.\n\np_p = 2 * m * c * sqrt(3)/2 = m c sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, total momentum P_total = m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ m c (3.872 - 1.732) ≈ m c (2.14)\n\nSo the total momentum is not zero. That means in the lab frame, the system has a net momentum to the right. After annihilation, the two photons must carry this total momentum. But the problem says that the two photons have equal energies. Since photons have energy E = pc, their momenta are equal in magnitude. So each photon has momentum p_photon = E / c. Since both have same energy, their momenta have same magnitude. Let me denote each photon's momentum as p.\n\nNow, the total momentum of the two photons must equal the total momentum before collision. So vectorially, p1 + p2 = P_total.\n\nBut since their energies are equal, |p1| = |p2| = p. Let me consider their directions. One is going upper-right and the other lower-right. So they are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. Let me denote the angle between each photon's direction and the horizontal axis as θ. So one is at +θ above the x-axis, the other at -θ below.\n\nTherefore, their momentum vectors are:\n\np1 = p (cosθ, sinθ)\n\np2 = p (cosθ, -sinθ)\n\nAdding them together:\n\nTotal momentum P_total = p1 + p2 = p (2 cosθ, 0)\n\nSo the total momentum is horizontal, which matches the initial total momentum (which was along x-axis). Therefore, the vertical components cancel out, which is good. The horizontal component is 2 p cosθ.\n\nThis must equal the initial total momentum, which is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo:\n\n2 p cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ... (1)\n\nNow, we also need to consider energy conservation. The total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. After collision, it's the sum of the energies of the two photons. Since each photon has energy E, total energy after collision is 2E. Therefore:\n\nE_electron + E_positron = 2E.\n\nLet me compute E_electron and E_positron. The relativistic energy is γmc².\n\nFor the electron, E_electron = γ_e m c² = 4 m c².\n\nFor the positron, E_positron = γ_p m c² = 2 m c².\n\nTherefore, total energy before collision: 4 m c² + 2 m c² = 6 m c².\n\nSo 2E = 6 m c² => E = 3 m c².\n\nBut the energy of each photon is E = pc, so p = E / c = 3 m c.\n\nTherefore, each photon has momentum p = 3 m c.\n\nNow, plug this into equation (1):\n\n2 * 3 m c * cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m c cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nDivide both sides by m c:\n\n6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nCompute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093\n\nSo 6 cosθ ≈ 2.14093 => cosθ ≈ 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nTherefore, θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ let me calculate that. Let's see, cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584, which is very close. So θ ≈ 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +θ and the other at -θ, the angle between them is 2θ. So if θ ≈ 69°, then angle between them is ≈ 138°. Which is option C.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again to make sure.\n\nFirst, let's recalculate sqrt(15) - sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(15) ≈ 3.872983346\n\nsqrt(3) ≈ 1.732050808\n\nSubtracting: 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 ≈ 2.140932538\n\nDivide by 6: ≈ 0.3568220897\n\nNow arccos(0.356822). Let me check with calculator.\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5, cos(69°) ≈ let me compute cos(69°):\n\nUsing calculator input: 69 degrees.\n\ncos(69°) ≈ 0.35836795, which is very close to 0.3568. The difference is about 0.35837 vs 0.3568. Let me find the exact angle.\n\nLet me compute arccos(0.3568). Let me use a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, since I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate.\n\nLet me denote θ where cosθ ≈ 0.3568.\n\nLet me consider that cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584, as I said. Our value is 0.3568, which is slightly less. So angle is slightly larger than 69°, since cosine decreases as angle increases.\n\nLet me compute the difference. Let me denote Δθ such that θ = 69° + Δθ.\n\nUsing the approximation cos(69° + Δθ) ≈ cos(69°) - sin(69°) * Δθ (in radians).\n\nWe have:\n\ncos(θ) ≈ 0.3584 - sin(69°) * Δθ = 0.3568\n\nSo 0.3584 - 0.3568 = sin(69°) * Δθ => 0.0016 = sin(69°)*Δθ\n\nCompute sin(69°): ≈ 0.9336\n\nTherefore, Δθ ≈ 0.0016 / 0.9336 ≈ 0.001714 radians. Convert to degrees: 0.001714 * (180/π) ≈ 0.098 degrees. So θ ≈ 69.098 degrees. So approximately 69.1 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138.2 degrees. Which is very close to option C: 138 degrees. So the answer is C.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in earlier steps.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nTotal energy before collision: 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc². Therefore each photon has energy 3mc². Therefore p_photon = 3mc. Then total momentum of photons is 2p cosθ = 6mc cosθ. Which equals initial momentum m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet me recheck the initial momentum calculation.\n\nFor the electron: γ_e = 4, v = c*sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ?\n\nWait, actually, another way to compute momentum is p = γmv. But since γ and v are known, we can compute p.\n\nAlternatively, since for the electron, γ_e = 4, and we can compute p_e = γ_e m v_e. But earlier I found that p_e = m c sqrt(15). Let me check that.\n\nGiven γ_e = 4, and v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nFrom γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) => v = c sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)\n\nSo for electron:\n\nv_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * sqrt(15)/4. Which is what I had before. Then p_e = γ m v = 4 m * c sqrt(15)/4 = m c sqrt(15). Correct.\n\nSame for positron: γ_p = 2, so v_p = c sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c sqrt(3/4) = c sqrt(3)/2. Then p_p = 2 m * c sqrt(3)/2 = m c sqrt(3). Correct. Then total momentum is sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) times m c. Correct.\n\nSo that's correct. Then the rest follows. So angle between photons is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees. So answer is C.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using the center-of-momentum frame?\n\nAlternatively, since in the lab frame the photons have equal energy, and their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, then their angle between them is 2θ. But perhaps there's another way to compute θ?\n\nAlternatively, since the photons have equal energy, which implies that their momenta are equal in magnitude and symmetric with respect to the direction of the total momentum. Since the total momentum is along x-axis, their angles are symmetric as we considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using invariant quantities? Let me think. The invariant total energy squared minus the total momentum squared times c² should be equal before and after.\n\nBut before collision, total energy is 6 m c², total momentum is P_total = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nTherefore, the invariant is (E_total)^2 - (P_total c)^2.\n\nAfter collision, the two photons have total energy 2E and total momentum P_total (same as before).\n\nBut since each photon's energy is E and their momenta are p, with E = pc.\n\nSo for the invariant:\n\n(2E)^2 - ( (2p cosθ) c )^2 = ?\n\nBut since E = pc, so substituting:\n\n(2pc)^2 - (2p cosθ c)^2 = 4p²c² - 4p²c² cos²θ = 4p²c²(1 - cos²θ) = 4p²c² sin²θ.\n\nThis should equal the invariant before collision:\n\n(6 m c²)^2 - (m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c)^2 = 36 m² c^4 - m² c^4 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))².\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))² = 15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(15*3) = 18 - 2*sqrt(45) = 18 - 6*sqrt(5) ≈ 18 - 6*2.236 ≈ 18 - 13.416 ≈ 4.584.\n\nBut let me do exact calculation:\n\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))² = 15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(45) = 18 - 6*sqrt(5). Therefore:\n\nInvariant before collision is 36 m² c^4 - m² c^4*(18 - 6√5) = m² c^4 [36 - 18 + 6√5] = m² c^4 [18 + 6√5].\n\nOn the other hand, invariant after collision is 4p²c² sin²θ * c²? Wait no:\n\nWait the invariant is (E_total² - (P_total c)^2). After collision, E_total is 2E = 6 m c², and P_total is 2 p cosθ. Therefore, the invariant is:\n\n(6 m c²)^2 - (2 p cosθ c)^2 = 36 m² c^4 - 4 p² c² cos²θ * c²? Wait no, units:\n\nWait E_total is in joules, P_total is momentum, so (P_total c) has units of energy. Therefore:\n\n(E_total² - (P_total c)^2) has units of energy squared.\n\nSo after collision:\n\nE_total² - (P_total c)^2 = (2E)^2 - ( (2 p cosθ) c )^2.\n\nBut since E = p c, then:\n\n= 4 p² c² - 4 p² c² cos²θ = 4 p² c² (1 - cos²θ) = 4 p² c² sin²θ.\n\nSet equal to before collision:\n\n4 p² c² sin²θ = m² c^4 [18 + 6√5]\n\nBut from earlier, we found p = 3 m c. Therefore:\n\n4*(9 m² c²)*c² sin²θ = 36 m² c^4 sin²θ = m² c^4 [18 + 6√5]\n\nTherefore:\n\n36 sin²θ = 18 + 6√5 => divide both sides by 6:\n\n6 sin²θ = 3 + √5 => sin²θ = (3 + √5)/6\n\nCompute (3 + √5)/6:\n\n√5 ≈ 2.236, so 3 + 2.236 ≈ 5.236 / 6 ≈ 0.8727\n\nSo sin²θ ≈ 0.8727 => sinθ ≈ sqrt(0.8727) ≈ 0.9342. Then θ ≈ arcsin(0.9342). Let me compute that. arcsin(0.9342). Well, sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397, sin(69°) ≈ 0.9336. So 0.9342 is between 69° and 70°, closer to 69.1°, which matches our previous result. Therefore, θ ≈ 69.1°, so angle between photons is 2θ ≈ 138.2°, which is option C: 138.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to compute sin²θ = (3 + √5)/6. Maybe exact angle?\n\nLet me see. Let me compute (3 + √5)/6. Suppose θ is such that sin²θ = (3 + √5)/6. Let me compute cos²θ = 1 - (3 + √5)/6 = (6 - 3 - √5)/6 = (3 - √5)/6 ≈ (3 - 2.236)/6 ≈ 0.764/6 ≈ 0.127. Wait earlier we had cosθ ≈ 0.3568, and 0.3568² ≈ 0.127. So yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an exact expression for θ. Let me think. Let me note that 2θ is the angle between the photons. Let me see if 2θ corresponds to some known angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate this to the golden ratio or something. But maybe not necessary. Since our approximate calculation gives 138 degrees, which is one of the options, and the exact value would be 2θ where θ satisfies cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 ≈ 0.3568. But regardless, the approximate value is 138 degrees. So answer is C.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C:138.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
