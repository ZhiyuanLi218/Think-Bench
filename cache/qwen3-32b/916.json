So, the question is asking which of the given quantities decreases as the inverse square of distance from the objects producing the fields. The options are A to D, each describing a different electric or magnetic field setup. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how electric and magnetic fields behave at distances far from their sources. The inverse square law is something I remember is associated with point charges or maybe spherical distributions because the field spreads out in three dimensions. For example, the electric field from a point charge decreases with 1/r². But when dealing with extended objects like rods, cylinders, planes, or wires, the field behavior might be different depending on their geometry.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod. Hmm. If the rod is finite, then at a distance far away from it, maybe it can be approximated as a point charge? Because if you're far away, the details of the rod's length become negligible, and it looks like a point. In that case, the electric field would follow the inverse square law, right? So maybe A is a candidate? But wait, maybe not? Wait, when you're close to a finite rod, the field doesn't follow inverse square, but when you're very far away, it does? Let me think. The electric field from a finite rod can be calculated by integrating the contributions from each infinitesimal charge element. If the distance from the rod is much larger than the length of the rod, then the rod can be treated as a point charge, so yes, E ~ 1/r². But if the distance isn't much larger, then the field depends on the position relative to the rod. However, the question specifies \"distances far from the objects,\" so in that case, maybe A does follow inverse square. But wait, I need to check the other options too.\n\nOption B: The electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder. An infinitely long cylinder... For such a case, using Gauss's Law, the electric field outside the cylinder depends on the linear charge density. The formula I remember is E = (λ)/(2πε₀r), where λ is the charge per unit length and r is the distance from the cylinder's axis. So here, the electric field decreases as 1/r, not 1/r². So B does not follow inverse square law. So B is out.\n\nOption C: The electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge. For an infinite plane, again using Gauss's Law, the electric field is constant and doesn't depend on distance from the plane. The formula is E = σ/(2ε₀), where σ is the surface charge density. So it doesn't decrease with distance at all. Therefore, C is not the answer.\n\nOption D: The magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire. The magnetic field around such a wire is given by Ampère's Law: B = (μ₀I)/(2πr). So here, the magnetic field decreases as 1/r, similar to the cylinder case. So D also doesn't follow inverse square.\n\nSo going back to option A. If the rod is finite, but we are considering distances far away, then the field should decrease as 1/r². However, if the rod were infinitely long, then maybe the field would decrease as 1/r, similar to the cylinder. But since the rod here is finite, at far distances, it's like a point charge. Therefore, A would follow inverse square.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me think about the derivation. For a finite line charge, the electric field at a point along the perpendicular bisector (for simplicity) at a distance r from the rod can be calculated. If the rod has length L and total charge Q, then the electric field at distance r is proportional to (1/(r√(r² + (L/2)²))) or something like that. But when r >> L, then √(r² + (L/2)²) ≈ r, so the field becomes proportional to 1/r². Therefore, in the far field, yes, the electric field from a finite rod does decrease as 1/r². So A would be the correct answer?\n\nBut wait, the question is about which one decreases as inverse square. The options are A, B, C, D. So according to this reasoning, A is correct. However, I need to check if there's any catch here. For example, sometimes in physics, even if something is far away, depending on the orientation or the way the field is measured, maybe the behavior changes. But the question is general, just saying \"distances far from the objects producing the fields.\" So assuming that the distance is much larger than any dimension of the object, then A would behave like a point charge, hence 1/r².\n\nBut let me check again. Let me think about the electric field of a finite rod. Suppose the rod is along the x-axis from -L/2 to +L/2. Let me calculate the electric field at a point along the y-axis at (0, y). The electric field from each infinitesimal charge element dq on the rod would have components. Due to symmetry, the horizontal components (x-direction) would cancel out, and only the vertical components (y-direction) would add up. The electric field from a small charge dq at position x is dE = k dq / r², where r is the distance from dq to the point (0, y). The vertical component is dE_y = dE * (y / r). So integrating over the rod:\n\nE = ∫ (k dq / r²) * (y / r) = k y ∫ dq / r³.\n\nBut r = sqrt(x² + y²). So substituting dq = λ dx (assuming linear charge density λ), we get:\n\nE = k y λ ∫_{-L/2}^{L/2} dx / (x² + y²)^{3/2} }.\n\nThis integral can be solved. Let me recall that ∫ dx / (x² + a²)^{3/2} } = x / (a² sqrt(x² + a²)) ) evaluated from -L/2 to L/2. Wait, or maybe there's a standard integral. Let me compute it.\n\nLet me make substitution x = a tanθ, so dx = a sec²θ dθ. Then denominator becomes (a² tan²θ + a²)^{3/2} = (a² sec²θ)^{3/2} = a³ sec³θ. Then dx / denominator is [a sec²θ dθ] / [a³ sec³θ] = (1/a²) cosθ dθ. Integrating from θ1 to θ2 gives (1/a²)(sinθ2 - sinθ1). \n\nBut in our case, a is y. Wait, let me check. In our case, the integral is ∫ dx / (x² + y²)^{3/2}. So a is y. Then the integral from x=-L/2 to x=L/2 is [x]/[y² sqrt(x² + y²)] evaluated from -L/2 to L/2. So:\n\nE = k y λ [ (L/2)/(y² sqrt( (L/2)^2 + y² )) - (-L/2)/(y² sqrt( (L/2)^2 + y² )) ) ] \n\nSimplify:\n\nE = k y λ [ (L/2 + L/2) / (y² sqrt( (L/2)^2 + y² )) ) ] = k y λ [ L / (y² sqrt( (L/2)^2 + y² )) ) ]\n\nSimplify further:\n\nE = k λ L / [ y sqrt( (L/2)^2 + y² ) ]\n\nBut k λ L is k Q, since λ L = Q. Therefore:\n\nE = k Q / [ y sqrt( (L/2)^2 + y² ) ]\n\nSo if y >> L, then sqrt( (L/2)^2 + y² ) ≈ y + (L²)/(8 y). So approximately y. Therefore, E ≈ k Q / y², which is the electric field of a point charge. Therefore, yes, for distances far from the rod, the electric field decreases as 1/r². Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check the other options again to make sure.\n\nOption B: Infinitely long cylinder. As I said before, E = λ/(2πε₀r). So 1/r dependence. So not inverse square.\n\nOption C: Infinite plane, E is constant. So no.\n\nOption D: Magnetic field from long straight wire: B = μ₀I/(2πr), again 1/r. Not inverse square.\n\nTherefore, only option A follows inverse square law at large distances.\n\nWait, but wait. The question says \"distances far from the objects producing the fields.\" For an infinitely long object, even if you go far away, it's still infinitely long. So for example, for an infinite cylinder, no matter how far you go, it's still like an infinite cylinder, so the field remains 1/r. Similarly for the infinite plane. But for a finite object, going far away makes it look like a point. So A is the only one here that would have inverse square dependence.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possibility. For example, maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking about dipoles or something else? For example, if you have a dipole, the field falls off as 1/r³. But here, the finite rod is a collection of charges, but if you are far away, it's just a point charge, so 1/r². Unless the rod is neutral? Wait, no, the question says \"charged rod,\" so it's a finite rod with some charge. So yes, it's equivalent to a point charge at far distances.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me check some references in my mind. For example, electric field of a line charge (infinite) is 1/r, finite line charge at far field is 1/r². Yes, that's correct. So A is the answer.\n\nSo the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
