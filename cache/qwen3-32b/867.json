The options are the Rydberg equation, Gibbs free energy equation, Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and Arrhenius equation.\n\nFirst, I'll try to recall what each of these equations is used for. Let's start with the Rydberg equation. I remember that the Rydberg equation is related to atomic spectra and the wavelengths of light emitted by hydrogen atoms. It's used in quantum mechanics, so probably not related to vapor pressure. So maybe A is not the right answer.\n\nNext, the Gibbs free energy equation. The Gibbs free energy is related to the spontaneity of reactions and the maximum reversible work. The equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. While this is important in thermodynamics, I don't think it directly relates vapor pressure and heat of vaporization. Maybe there's a connection through thermodynamic principles, but I think the question is looking for a specific equation that links vapor pressure and heat of vaporization directly. So B might not be it.\n\nThen there's the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. I remember this one from my chemistry classes. It's used to describe the relationship between vapor pressure and temperature for a substance undergoing a phase change, like evaporation. The equation involves the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) and the vapor pressure. The basic form is ln(P) = -ΔHvap/(R) * (1/T) + C, where P is vapor pressure, T is temperature, R is gas constant, and C is a constant. So this equation relates vapor pressure and heat of vaporization, making C a strong candidate.\n\nLastly, the Arrhenius equation. This one is related to the rate constants of chemical reactions and how they depend on temperature. The Arrhenius equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(RT)), where Ea is the activation energy. While it does involve temperature and exponential terms similar to the Clausius-Clapeyron, it's about reaction rates, not vapor pressure. So D is probably not the right answer.\n\nTo double-check, let me think about the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again. It's derived from thermodynamics and is used to calculate the vapor pressure at different temperatures if you know the heat of vaporization. The equation can be rearranged to solve for ΔHvap if you have vapor pressure measurements at two different temperatures. That definitely ties vapor pressure and heat of vaporization together. \n\nThe other equations don't make that specific connection. Rydberg is for atomic spectra, Gibbs free energy is more general thermodynamics, and Arrhenius is for kinetics. So the correct answer must be C: Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\n</think>"}
