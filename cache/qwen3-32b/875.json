It states that:\n\n> **Electrons will fill each orbital in a subshell singly with parallel spins before any pairing occurs.**\n\nThis is important because electrons repel each other due to their like charges, and they tend to minimize repulsion by occupying different orbitals when possible. The rule helps explain the electron configurations of atoms and the magnetic properties of elements.\n\n---\n\nLet's evaluate the given options in light of this:\n\n- **Option A: \"No two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers.\"**  \n  This is the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, not Hund's rule.

Let me start by recalling what I know about Hund's rule. From my chemistry class, I remember that Hund's rule is about the filling of electrons in atomic orbitals. It has something to do with electrons filling orbitals in a way that maximizes their total spin. \n\nLet me break it down. Electrons in the same subshell (like p, d, f orbitals) will fill each orbital singly before pairing up. This is because electrons repel each other due to their negative charges, so they prefer to be in different orbitals to minimize repulsion. Also, each of these single electrons will have parallel spins. This is related to the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers. Wait, but that's the Pauli exclusion principle, not Hund's rule. \n\nSo, the Pauli exclusion principle is about no two electrons having the same set of four quantum numbers, which means each orbital can hold at most two electrons with opposite spins. Hund's rule is different. It's about the order in which electrons fill orbitals when there are multiple orbitals of the same energy (degenerate orbitals). \n\nLet me think of an example. Take carbon, which has the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p². The 2p subshell has three orbitals. According to Hund's rule, the two electrons in the 2p subshell will each go into separate orbitals with parallel spins before pairing up. So each of the first two orbitals will have one electron each with the same spin, and the third orbital will be empty. Only when all orbitals have one electron each will the next electron start pairing up.\n\nSo, applying this to the options given:\n\nOption A: \"No two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers.\" That sounds like the Pauli exclusion principle, not Hund's rule. So A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: \"No two electrons with the same spin can occupy an orbital.\" Wait, an orbital can hold two electrons with opposite spins. So if two electrons have the same spin, they can't be in the same orbital. But this is again part of the Pauli exclusion principle. Because each electron must have a unique set of quantum numbers, which includes spin. So if two electrons are in the same orbital, their n, l, m_l are the same, so their spin quantum numbers must differ. So B is also Pauli, not Hund. So B is not the answer.\n\nOption C: \"No two electrons can occupy separate orbitals.\" That doesn't make sense. Electrons definitely can and do occupy separate orbitals. In fact, that's what Hund's rule is about. So C seems incorrect. Maybe a trick option.\n\nOption D: \"No two electrons can pair up if there is an empty orbital at the same energy level available.\" This sounds like what I was thinking earlier. Electrons will fill each orbital singly before pairing up. So if there's an empty orbital of the same energy (same subshell), electrons will occupy that instead of pairing up in an already occupied orbital. That matches with Hund's rule. So D is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me check again. Hund's rule states that electrons will fill orbitals singly with parallel spins before pairing up. So when there are multiple orbitals of the same energy (like the three p orbitals), electrons will go into each one individually before any pairing occurs. So yes, if there's an empty orbital at the same energy level, electrons won't pair up until all orbitals have one electron each. Therefore, option D is the correct statement of Hund's rule.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
