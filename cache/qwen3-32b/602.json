The given ratio $k = \\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{2a}{2b} = \\frac{a}{b}$, so we can express $a = kb$, and thus the rectangle is defined by the vertices:\n\n- $A = (-a, b)$\n- $B = (a, b)$\n- $C = (a, -b)$\n- $D = (-a, -b)$\n\nWe are to find the probability that a randomly chosen point $(x, y)$ in the rectangle is closer to $O$ than to any vertex.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Strategy**\n\n- The set of points equidistant to $O$ and a vertex lies on the **perpendicular bisector** of the segment from $O$ to that vertex.\n- The region where the point is closer to $O$ than to a vertex is the **half-plane** on the side of the perpendicular bisector that contains $O$.\n- The region where the point is **closer to $O$ than to any vertex** is the **intersection** of the four half-planes defined by the perpendicular bisectors of $O$ with each vertex.\n\nDue to the **symmetry** of the rectangle and the location of the center $O$, we can exploit this to simplify the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Coordinate Transformation and Area Calculation**\n\nLet’s normalize the rectangle by setting $b = 1$, so that $a = k$.

By examining the intersection of the four half-planes (closer to $O$ than each vertex), and using symmetry, it turns out that the area of this region is **always exactly half** the area of the rectangle.\n\nThis result is counterintuitive at first glance, but it is mathematically consistent across various values of $k$.

The rectangle has a ratio of AB/AD = k. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the rectangle. The rectangle has center O, which is the intersection point of its diagonals. Since it's a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. The ratio of AB to AD is given as k. Let me denote AB as the length of the horizontal side and AD as the vertical side. So if AB is the horizontal side, then AB = length, and AD = width. Therefore, AB/AD = k implies that the rectangle's aspect ratio is k:1.\n\nTo approach this problem, I think I need to use coordinate geometry. Let me set up a coordinate system with the center O at the origin (0, 0). Then, the rectangle can be represented with coordinates. Since O is the center, the rectangle extends equally in all directions from O. Let me denote half the length of AB as 'a' and half the length of AD as 'b'. Therefore, AB = 2a and AD = 2b. Given that AB/AD = k, so (2a)/(2b) = k => a/b = k => a = k*b. So the rectangle's half-length is k times the half-width.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the rectangle's vertices can be given as follows:\n- A: (-a, b)\n- B: (a, b)\n- C: (a, -b)\n- D: (-a, -b)\n\nBut since O is the origin (0, 0), that's the center.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability that a randomly selected point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So, for a point (x, y) inside the rectangle, we need the distance from (x, y) to O is less than the distance to A, B, C, and D.\n\nSince the rectangle is symmetric, maybe I can focus on one region and multiply accordingly? Let me think. The rectangle is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis. Therefore, the regions where the point is closer to O than to any vertex should also be symmetric. Therefore, I can consider the first quadrant (where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0) and find the area there, then multiply by 4 to get the total area where the condition is satisfied. Alternatively, maybe even exploit symmetry further?\n\nBut first, let me formalize the condition. For a point (x, y), the distance to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The distance to vertex A (-a, b) is sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²). Similarly, the distance to vertex B (a, b) is sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²), to C (a, -b) is sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²), and to D (-a, -b) is sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²).\n\nThe point (x, y) must satisfy sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²), sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²), sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²), and sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²).\n\nBut due to the symmetry, maybe in each quadrant, the condition simplifies? For example, in the first quadrant (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0), the closest vertices are B (a, b) and maybe others? Wait, but depending on where the point is, the closest vertex could be different. But since we need the point to be closer to O than to any vertex, perhaps in each quadrant, we can compare to the closest vertex in that quadrant?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that in each quadrant, the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex.\n\nYes, that's a good approach. In general, the set of points equidistant to two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting them. Therefore, the region where points are closer to O than to a vertex is the region on the O side of the perpendicular bisector between O and that vertex.\n\nTherefore, for each vertex, we can find the perpendicular bisector between O and that vertex, and the intersection of all four half-planes defined by being closer to O than each vertex would give the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex.\n\nSince there are four vertices, we need to find the intersection of four regions: closer to O than A, closer to O than B, closer to O than C, closer to O than D.\n\nBut again, due to symmetry, maybe we can focus on one quadrant? Let me try that.\n\nLet me consider the first quadrant where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. In this quadrant, the closest vertices to a point would be B (a, b) and maybe A (-a, b) or D (-a, -b)? Wait, but in the first quadrant, points are closer to B and C? Wait, no. For a point in the first quadrant, the closest vertex would be either B or maybe another one?\n\nActually, for a point in the first quadrant, the distance to vertex B (a, b) would be the closest among all four vertices. However, depending on where the point is, maybe the distance to O is compared to distances to B and maybe to other vertices? But due to the symmetry, perhaps in the first quadrant, the region where the point is closer to O than any vertex is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors between O and B, and between O and A? Wait, but if we are in the first quadrant, maybe the relevant perpendicular bisectors are between O and B, and between O and A? Wait, but A is in the second quadrant. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each quadrant, the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is bounded by the bisectors between O and the two adjacent vertices in that quadrant? For example, in the first quadrant, between O and B, and between O and maybe another vertex? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of all four bisectors. Therefore, in each quadrant, the boundary is formed by the bisectors between O and each vertex.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to find the equations for these bisectors and then find the intersection region.\n\nLet me try to find the perpendicular bisector between O (0, 0) and vertex A (-a, b). The perpendicular bisector of OA is the set of points equidistant to O and A.\n\nLet me compute that equation. For a general point (x, y), equidistant to O (0,0) and A (-a, b):\n\nsqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nx² + y² = (x + a)² + (y - b)²\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\nx² + 2ax + a² + y² - 2by + b²\n\nTherefore, simplifying:\n\nx² + y² = x² + 2ax + a² + y² - 2by + b²\n\nCancel x² and y²:\n\n0 = 2ax + a² - 2by + b²\n\nRearranged:\n\n2ax - 2by + (a² + b²) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nax - by + (a² + b²)/2 = 0\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Wait:\n\nWait, original equation after squaring:\n\nx² + y² = (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2\n\nExpanding RHS:\n\nx² + 2ax + a² + y² - 2by + b²\n\nTherefore, subtract LHS:\n\n0 = 2ax + a² - 2by + b²\n\nTherefore, equation is 2ax - 2by + a² + b² = 0?\n\nWait, no. Wait, moving x² + y² to RHS would be 0 = 2ax + a² - 2by + b². So equation is:\n\n2ax - 2by + (a² + b²) = 0.\n\nYes. So that's the equation for the perpendicular bisector between O and A. Similarly, we can find equations for the bisectors between O and B, O and C, O and D.\n\nBut since we have symmetry, maybe in the first quadrant, the relevant bisectors are between O and B, and between O and maybe another vertex? Wait, in the first quadrant, if we are considering points closer to O than to B, then the bisector between O and B would be one boundary. Similarly, points closer to O than to A? But A is in the second quadrant, so maybe for points in the first quadrant, being closer to O than to A is automatically true? Wait, not necessarily. For example, a point near the edge of the rectangle close to vertex A might be closer to A than to O even if it's in the first quadrant? Wait, but vertex A is at (-a, b). If a point is in the first quadrant, x ≥ 0, so the distance to A would be sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2), while the distance to O is sqrt(x² + y²). Depending on where the point is, maybe it can be closer to A?\n\nFor example, take a point very close to (0, b). The distance to O is sqrt(0² + b²) = b. The distance to A is sqrt((0 + a)^2 + (b - b)^2) = sqrt(a²) = a. Therefore, if a < b, then the point is closer to A. If a > b, then closer to O. Since a = k*b, so if k < 1, then a < b, so point near (0, b) is closer to A. If k > 1, then closer to O. Therefore, depending on the value of k, the region where points are closer to O than to A may or may not include parts of the first quadrant.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector between O and A would cut through the first quadrant when k < 1? Hmm, this complicates things. Therefore, perhaps the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is bounded by all four bisectors, and depending on the value of k, the shape of that region changes. Therefore, maybe I need to find the equations of all four bisectors and find their intersection within the rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since the problem is asking for a probability, which is the area of the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex divided by the area of the rectangle. The area of the rectangle is AB * AD = (2a)(2b) = 4ab.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the area of the region where for all four vertices, the distance to O is less than the distance to each vertex.\n\nAlternatively, since distance functions are convex, the region where distance to O is less than distance to each vertex is the intersection of four regions, each defined by being closer to O than to a vertex. Each of these regions is a half-plane defined by the perpendicular bisector between O and the respective vertex.\n\nTherefore, the region we want is the intersection of these four half-planes. So if I can find the equations of these four bisectors, find their intersection polygon, compute its area, and divide by 4ab, that would give the probability.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find equations of the four bisectors:\n\n1. Between O(0,0) and A(-a, b): as above, 2ax - 2by + (a² + b²) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other vertices:\n\n2. Between O(0,0) and B(a, b):\n\nEquation: sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt((x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nx² + y² = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2\n\nExpanding RHS:\n\nx² - 2ax + a² + y² - 2by + b²\n\nSubtract LHS:\n\n0 = -2ax + a² - 2by + b²\n\nTherefore, equation: -2ax - 2by + a² + b² = 0 => 2ax + 2by = a² + b² => ax + by = (a² + b²)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for the bisector between O and C(a, -b):\n\nEquation would be sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt((x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2)\n\nSquaring:\n\nx² + y² = (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2\n\nExpanding RHS:\n\nx² - 2ax + a² + y² + 2by + b²\n\nSubtract LHS:\n\n0 = -2ax + a² + 2by + b² => -2ax + 2by + a² + b² = 0 => 2ax - 2by = a² + b² => ax - by = (a² + b²)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for the bisector between O and D(-a, -b):\n\nsqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2)\n\nSquaring:\n\nx² + y² = x² + 2ax + a² + y² + 2by + b² => 0 = 2ax + a² + 2by + b² => 2ax + 2by + a² + b² = 0 => ax + by = - (a² + b²)/2.\n\nBut since a and b are positive lengths, this equation ax + by = - (a² + b²)/2 would represent a line in the negative quadrant. However, since our rectangle is from -a to a in x and -b to b in y, the line ax + by = - (a² + b²)/2 would lie outside the rectangle. Similarly, the bisector between O and A: 2ax - 2by + a² + b² = 0, which can be rewritten as ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2. Depending on the value of k, this line might intersect the rectangle or not.\n\nTherefore, the four bisectors are:\n\n1. ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2 (bisector OA)\n2. ax + by = (a² + b²)/2 (bisector OB)\n3. ax - by = (a² + b²)/2 (bisector OC)\n4. ax + by = - (a² + b²)/2 (bisector OD)\n\nBut again, equations 1 and 3: ax - by = ± (a² + b²)/2, and equations 2 and 4: ax + by = ± (a² + b²)/2. However, equations 4 and 1/3 might lie outside the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the region we want is the intersection of the four half-planes defined by:\n\n- For each vertex, the half-plane closer to O.\n\nFor example, for vertex A(-a, b), the bisector is ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2. The half-plane closer to O would be where ax - by > - (a² + b²)/2? Wait, how do we determine which side of the bisector is closer to O?\n\nLet me check with a test point. For the bisector between O and A: ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2. Let me take O(0,0) and plug into the left-hand side: 0 - 0 = 0. Compare to - (a² + b²)/2. Since 0 > - (a² + b²)/2, the half-plane containing O is ax - by > - (a² + b²)/2. Similarly for the other bisectors.\n\nTherefore, the region closer to O than to A is ax - by > - (a² + b²)/2.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Closer to O than to B: ax + by < (a² + b²)/2.\n\n- Closer to O than to C: ax - by < (a² + b²)/2.\n\n- Closer to O than to D: ax + by > - (a² + b²)/2.\n\nTherefore, combining all four inequalities, the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is:\n\n- (a² + b²)/2 > ax + by > - (a² + b²)/2,\n\nand\n\n- (a² + b²)/2 > ax - by > - (a² + b²)/2.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n|ax + by| < (a² + b²)/2 and |ax - by| < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nTherefore, the region is defined by both |ax + by| < (a² + b²)/2 and |ax - by| < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nThis seems like a diamond or a square rotated by 45 degrees? Wait, maybe. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since these are inequalities involving linear combinations of x and y, the region defined by |ax + by| < C and |ax - by| < C is the intersection of two bands. The intersection would be a rectangle rotated by 45 degrees? Or maybe another shape?\n\nAlternatively, if we make a coordinate transformation. Let me consider u = ax + by and v = ax - by. Then the region is |u| < (a² + b²)/2 and |v| < (a² + b²)/2. Therefore, in the uv-plane, this is a square centered at the origin with sides parallel to the axes, from - (a² + b²)/2 to + (a² + b²)/2 in both u and v.\n\nBut we need to find the area of this region within the original rectangle ABCD. However, the original rectangle in xy-coordinates is from x ∈ [-a, a], y ∈ [-b, b]. Therefore, the transformation from (x, y) to (u, v) is linear. The area in the uv-plane corresponding to the original rectangle can be found using the determinant of the transformation matrix.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the inequalities |ax + by| < (a² + b²)/2 and |ax - by| < (a² + b²)/2, we can try to find the region in the xy-plane.\n\nLet me consider the first quadrant where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. In this quadrant, the inequalities become:\n\nax + by < (a² + b²)/2,\n\nand\n\nax - by < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nBut since x and y are positive, ax - by can be positive or negative depending on the values of x and y. However, since we have absolute values, maybe in the first quadrant, we need to consider the inequalities without absolute values but considering the signs?\n\nWait, no. The original combined region is |ax + by| < (a² + b²)/2 and |ax - by| < (a² + b²)/2. In the first quadrant, ax + by is positive, so |ax + by| = ax + by. For |ax - by|, depending on whether ax - by is positive or negative. If ax - by is positive, then |ax - by| = ax - by; if negative, it's -(ax - by). However, since we have both inequalities, in the first quadrant, we need to ensure that ax - by is between - (a² + b²)/2 and + (a² + b²)/2. But since in the first quadrant, ax and by are positive, so ax - by can be positive or negative. Therefore, we need both ax + by < (a² + b²)/2 and - (a² + b²)/2 < ax - by < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nBut perhaps in the first quadrant, we can split into regions where ax - by is positive or negative? However, maybe it's easier to consider all four inequalities together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the intersection curves. Let me try to sketch mentally. The region defined by |ax + by| < C and |ax - by| < C is the intersection of two regions, each being between two parallel lines. The intersection would be a square rotated by 45 degrees, but scaled.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of ax + by = ±(a² + b²)/2 and ax - by = ±(a² + b²)/2, these four lines form a square centered at the origin. The intersection of the regions between these lines is that square.\n\nTherefore, the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is a square centered at O, with sides determined by those equations. However, this square might be entirely inside the rectangle, or it might be clipped by the rectangle's boundaries, depending on the value of k.\n\nTherefore, we need to check if the square defined by those inequalities lies entirely within the rectangle or not. If it does, then the area is simply the area of that square. If not, then we need to compute the area of the intersection between the square and the rectangle.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nFirst, let's compute the coordinates of the square's vertices. The square is formed by the intersection of the four lines:\n\n1. ax + by = (a² + b²)/2\n\n2. ax + by = - (a² + b²)/2\n\n3. ax - by = (a² + b²)/2\n\n4. ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2\n\nThe intersection points of these lines will form a square. For example, the intersection of 1 and 3:\n\nSolving ax + by = (a² + b²)/2 and ax - by = (a² + b²)/2.\n\nAdding both equations:\n\n2ax = (a² + b²)/2 + (a² + b²)/2 = a² + b² => x = (a² + b²)/(2a)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n2by = 0 => y = 0.\n\nTherefore, one vertex is at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0). Similarly, intersection of 1 and -3:\n\nax + by = (a² + b²)/2 and ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2.\n\nAdding: 2ax = 0 => x = 0. Subtracting: 2by = (a² + b²)/2 - (- (a² + b²)/2) = a² + b² => y = (a² + b²)/(2b). Therefore, another vertex is (0, (a² + b²)/(2b)).\n\nSimilarly, the other vertices can be found as (- (a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and (0, - (a² + b²)/(2b)), but since we are considering the square formed by all four lines, it's actually a square rotated by 45 degrees? Wait, the four vertices we found are ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0), (0, (a² + b²)/(2b)), (- (a² + b²)/(2a), 0), (0, - (a² + b²)/(2b)). Connecting these points would form a diamond shape (a square rotated by 45 degrees) centered at the origin.\n\nBut the problem is whether this diamond lies entirely within the rectangle ABCD. The rectangle extends from x = -a to x = a, and y = -b to y = b. Therefore, we need to check if (a² + b²)/(2a) ≤ a and (a² + b²)/(2b) ≤ b.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFor the x-coordinate: (a² + b²)/(2a) ≤ a?\n\nMultiply both sides by 2a (positive):\n\na² + b² ≤ 2a² => b² ≤ a² => b ≤ a.\n\nSimilarly, for the y-coordinate: (a² + b²)/(2b) ≤ b => a² + b² ≤ 2b² => a² ≤ b² => a ≤ b.\n\nTherefore, depending on the relationship between a and b, which is determined by k = a/b.\n\nGiven that k = a/b, so a = k*b.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the inequalities:\n\nFor the x-coordinate: ( (k² b²) + b² ) / (2k b) ) ≤ a = k b ?\n\nSimplify numerator: b²(k² + 1). Denominator: 2k b. Therefore:\n\n(b²(k² + 1)) / (2k b) ) = b(k² + 1)/(2k) ≤ k b ?\n\nDivide both sides by b (positive):\n\n(k² + 1)/(2k) ≤ k => Multiply both sides by 2k:\n\nk² + 1 ≤ 2k² => 1 ≤ k² => k² ≥ 1 => |k| ≥ 1. Since k is a ratio of lengths, positive, so k ≥ 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the y-coordinate: (a² + b²)/(2b) ≤ b ?\n\nSubstitute a = k b:\n\n( (k² b² + b² ) / (2b) ) = b(k² + 1)/2 ≤ b => (k² + 1)/2 ≤ 1 => k² + 1 ≤ 2 => k² ≤ 1 => k ≤ 1.\n\nTherefore, depending on the value of k:\n\n- If k ≥ 1, then (a² + b²)/(2a) ≤ a (so the diamond's vertex on x-axis is inside the rectangle), but (a² + b²)/(2b) ≤ b only if k ≤ 1. Since k ≥ 1 here, this would only hold if k = 1. Therefore, if k > 1, then (a² + b²)/(2b) > b, meaning that the diamond's vertex on the y-axis is outside the rectangle. Similarly, if k < 1, then the diamond's vertex on the x-axis is outside the rectangle, but the one on the y-axis is inside.\n\nTherefore, the diamond defined by the four bisectors is entirely inside the rectangle only when k = 1, i.e., when the rectangle is a square. For other values of k, parts of the diamond lie outside the rectangle, so the region where points are closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the diamond with the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, we need to handle two cases:\n\nCase 1: k ≥ 1 (a ≥ b)\n\nIn this case, the diamond's vertex on the x-axis is inside the rectangle, but the one on the y-axis is outside. Therefore, the intersection region is bounded by the diamond's lines on the x-axis side and by the rectangle's top and bottom sides on the y-axis side.\n\nCase 2: k ≤ 1 (a ≤ b)\n\nSymmetric to Case 1, with x and y swapped.\n\nTherefore, due to the problem's symmetry, we can compute the area for one case (say, k ≥ 1) and then express the general probability in terms of k.\n\nLet me proceed with Case 1: k ≥ 1 (a ≥ b). Then, the diamond's vertex on the x-axis is at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0). Since a ≥ b, let me compute this x-coordinate:\n\nx = (a² + b²)/(2a) = a/2 + b²/(2a). Since a ≥ b, then b²/(2a) ≤ b²/(2b) = b/2. Therefore, x ≤ a/2 + b/2. Since a ≥ b, this is less than a (because if a = b, x = a/2 + a/2 = a; if a > b, then x < a/2 + a/2 = a). Therefore, this x is within the rectangle's x-range [-a, a].\n\nHowever, the diamond's vertex on the y-axis is at (0, (a² + b²)/(2b)). Let me compute that:\n\ny = (a² + b²)/(2b) = a²/(2b) + b/2. Since a ≥ b, a²/(2b) ≥ a/2. Therefore, y ≥ a/2 + b/2. Since a ≥ b, this is at least b/2 + b/2 = b. But since a ≥ b, if a > b, then a²/(2b) > a/2. Therefore, y > b/2 + b/2 = b. Therefore, this point is outside the rectangle's y-range [-b, b]. Therefore, the intersection of the diamond with the rectangle in this case is bounded by the lines ax + by = (a² + b²)/2 and ax - by = (a² + b²)/2, but clipped by the rectangle's top and bottom sides y = ±b.\n\nTherefore, to compute the area in this case, I need to find the region within the rectangle where |ax + by| < (a² + b²)/2 and |ax - by| < (a² + b²)/2. However, since the diamond extends beyond the rectangle in the y-direction, the actual region is the intersection.\n\nGiven the symmetry, I can compute the area in the first quadrant and multiply by 4.\n\nIn the first quadrant, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0. The inequalities become:\n\nax + by < (a² + b²)/2,\n\nand\n\nax - by < (a² + b²)/2,\n\nand\n\nax - by > - (a² + b²)/2,\n\nand\n\nax + by > - (a² + b²)/2.\n\nBut since x, y ≥ 0, ax + by ≥ 0 and ax - by can be positive or negative. However, since we are in the first quadrant, let's consider:\n\nThe inequalities simplify to:\n\nax + by < (a² + b²)/2,\n\nand\n\n- (a² + b²)/2 < ax - by < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nBut since ax - by can be negative or positive, depending on x and y.\n\nBut given that in the first quadrant, and considering that we have a ≥ b (Case 1), maybe ax - by can be negative or positive? Let's see. For example, take a point near (0, 0): ax - by is 0 - 0 = 0. Take a point near (a, 0): ax - by = a² - 0 = a². Take a point near (0, b): ax - by = 0 - b² = -b². Therefore, in the first quadrant, ax - by ranges from -b² to a². Therefore, the inequality - (a² + b²)/2 < ax - by < (a² + b²)/2 will cut off parts of the first quadrant.\n\nBut since we are in Case 1 (a ≥ b), let's see what these inequalities mean.\n\nFirst inequality: ax + by < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: ax - by < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nThird inequality: ax - by > - (a² + b²)/2.\n\nBut since in the first quadrant, ax + by ≥ 0 and ax - by can be from -b² to a².\n\nTherefore, combining all, in the first quadrant, the region is bounded by:\n\nax + by < (a² + b²)/2,\n\nax - by < (a² + b²)/2,\n\nand ax - by > - (a² + b²)/2.\n\nBut perhaps we can find the boundaries where these inequalities intersect the rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, since the region is symmetric, maybe we can parametrize the boundaries.\n\nLet me focus on the first quadrant. The region we want is the set of points (x, y) in [0, a] × [0, b] such that ax + by < (a² + b²)/2 and |ax - by| < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nBut since in Case 1, a ≥ b, and the line ax - by = (a² + b²)/2 intersects the rectangle? Let me check where the line ax - by = (a² + b²)/2 intersects the rectangle in the first quadrant.\n\nSolving for y:\n\nax - by = (a² + b²)/2 => by = ax - (a² + b²)/2 => y = [ax - (a² + b²)/2]/b.\n\nIn the first quadrant, x ranges from 0 to a, y from 0 to b.\n\nFind where this line intersects the rectangle. Let me find intersection with y = 0:\n\nSet y = 0: ax = (a² + b²)/2 => x = (a² + b²)/(2a). As before, which is within [0, a] because for a ≥ b, (a² + b²)/(2a) ≤ a? Let's check:\n\n(a² + b²)/2a ≤ a => a² + b² ≤ 2a² => b² ≤ a², which is true since a ≥ b. Therefore, the line ax - by = (a² + b²)/2 intersects the x-axis at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0).\n\nSimilarly, find intersection with x = a:\n\nSet x = a: a² - by = (a² + b²)/2 => -by = -a²/2 + b²/2 => y = (a²/2 - b²/2)/b = (a² - b²)/(2b).\n\nSince a ≥ b, this y is non-negative. Now check if it's ≤ b:\n\n(a² - b²)/(2b) ≤ b ?\n\nMultiply both sides by 2b:\n\na² - b² ≤ 2b² => a² ≤ 3b². But since a ≥ b, this depends on the value of a/b = k. For example, if k = 2 (a = 2b), then a² = 4b², which is greater than 3b². Therefore, y = (4b² - b²)/(2b) = 3b/2 > b. Therefore, this intersection point is outside the rectangle. Therefore, the line ax - by = (a² + b²)/2 intersects the rectangle in the first quadrant at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and somewhere on y = b? Wait, let's check intersection with y = b:\n\nSet y = b: ax - b² = (a² + b²)/2 => ax = (a² + b²)/2 + b² = (a² + 3b²)/2 => x = (a² + 3b²)/(2a).\n\nCheck if this x is within [0, a]:\n\n(a² + 3b²)/(2a) ≤ a ?\n\nMultiply both sides by 2a:\n\na² + 3b² ≤ 2a² => 3b² ≤ a² => which is true if a ≥ √3 b. Since in Case 1, a ≥ b, but not necessarily ≥ √3 b. Therefore, depending on k, this intersection point may be inside or outside the rectangle.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead of trying to find intersections, I can parametrize the region.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two inequalities in the first quadrant:\n\n1. ax + by < (a² + b²)/2,\n\n2. |ax - by| < (a² + b²)/2.\n\nLet me consider solving these inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: ax + by < C, where C = (a² + b²)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: -C < ax - by < C.\n\nLet me consider the second inequality as two separate inequalities:\n\nax - by < C,\n\nand\n\n-ax + by < C => ax - by > -C.\n\nTherefore, in total, in the first quadrant, we have three inequalities:\n\nax + by < C,\n\nax - by < C,\n\nand\n\nax - by > -C.\n\nBut since x and y are positive, let's analyze these.\n\nLet me consider the first inequality ax + by < C. This is a line that cuts the first quadrant. Similarly, the other inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two inequalities involving ax ± by, perhaps we can combine them.\n\nLet me consider adding and subtracting the inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, think of ax + by < C and ax - by < C. If we add them:\n\n2ax < 2C => ax < C => x < C/a = (a² + b²)/(2a) = a/2 + b²/(2a).\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the second inequality from the first:\n\n(ax + by) - (ax - by) < C - (-C) => 2by < 2C => by < C => y < C/b = (a² + b²)/(2b) = a²/(2b) + b/2.\n\nTherefore, combining these, we have x < [a/2 + b²/(2a)] and y < [a²/(2b) + b/2].\n\nBut since we are in the first quadrant and also have ax - by > -C, which is ax - by > -C => ax + C > by => y < (ax + C)/b. Not sure if helpful.\n\nBut these bounds on x and y are helpful. However, we also need to ensure that ax + by < C and ax - by > -C. Therefore, perhaps the region is a polygon bounded by these lines and the rectangle's edges.\n\nAlternatively, given that this is getting too abstract, maybe I can use integration to find the area.\n\nBut before that, let me recall that the problem is to find the probability, which is the area of the region divided by the area of the rectangle (which is 4ab). Therefore, maybe I can compute the area in the first quadrant and multiply by 4.\n\nLet me attempt to find the area in the first quadrant.\n\nIn the first quadrant, the region is bounded by:\n\n1. ax + by < C,\n\n2. ax - by < C,\n\n3. ax - by > -C,\n\nand\n\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, x ≤ a, y ≤ b.\n\nBut with C = (a² + b²)/2.\n\nLet me try to sketch this mentally. The line ax + by = C intersects the x-axis at x = C/a = a/2 + b²/(2a) and the y-axis at y = C/b = a²/(2b) + b/2. Similarly, the line ax - by = C intersects the x-axis at x = C/a and goes upwards, while the line ax - by = -C intersects the y-axis at y = C/b and goes downwards.\n\nBut since in Case 1 (a ≥ b), the intersection points of ax + by = C with the axes may be inside or outside the rectangle.\n\nFor example, the intersection with the y-axis for ax + by = C is at y = C/b = (a² + b²)/(2b) = a²/(2b) + b/2. As discussed earlier, if a ≥ b, then a²/(2b) ≥ a/2. Therefore, this y-coordinate is ≥ a/2 + b/2. Since a ≥ b, this is ≥ b/2 + b/2 = b when a = b. If a > b, then it's greater than b. Therefore, in Case 1, this intersection point is outside the rectangle. Therefore, in the first quadrant, the line ax + by = C intersects the rectangle only at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) on the x-axis and somewhere on the top edge y = b?\n\nWait, let me find where ax + by = C intersects y = b:\n\nax + b*b = C => ax = C - b² = (a² + b²)/2 - b² = (a² - b²)/2 => x = (a² - b²)/(2a).\n\nWhich is (a/2 - b²/(2a)). Since a ≥ b, this x is positive. And since a ≥ b, let's check if x ≤ a:\n\n(a² - b²)/(2a) ≤ a ?\n\nMultiply both sides by 2a:\n\na² - b² ≤ 2a² => -b² ≤ a², which is always true. Therefore, this intersection point is at ((a² - b²)/(2a), b). Therefore, in the first quadrant, the line ax + by = C goes from ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) to ((a² - b²)/(2a), b). However, note that (a² - b²)/(2a) is less than (a² + b²)/(2a), since we subtract b² instead of adding.\n\nTherefore, in the first quadrant, the region defined by ax + by < C is below this line from ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) to ((a² - b²)/(2a), b).\n\nSimilarly, the line ax - by = C intersects the x-axis at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and goes upwards. Let me find where it intersects y = b:\n\nax - b*b = C => ax = C + b² = (a² + b²)/2 + b² = (a² + 3b²)/2 => x = (a² + 3b²)/(2a). As discussed earlier, this is greater than a if a² + 3b² > 2a² => 3b² > a² => a < √3 b. Therefore, if a ≥ √3 b, then this x is less than or equal to a. If a < √3 b, then x > a, meaning the intersection is outside the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, in Case 1 (a ≥ b):\n\n- If a ≥ √3 b, then the line ax - by = C intersects the rectangle at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and ((a² + 3b²)/(2a), b). But since a ≥ √3 b, then (a² + 3b²)/(2a) ≤ a ?\n\nLet me check with a = √3 b:\n\n( (√3 b)^2 + 3b² ) / (2 * √3 b ) = (3b² + 3b²)/(2√3 b) = 6b² / (2√3 b) = 3b / √3 = √3 b = a. Therefore, equality holds. If a > √3 b, then (a² + 3b²)/(2a) < a ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n(a² + 3b²)/(2a) < a ?\n\nMultiply both sides by 2a:\n\na² + 3b² < 2a² => 3b² < a² => which is true since a ≥ √3 b. Therefore, for a ≥ √3 b, the line ax - by = C intersects the rectangle at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and ((a² + 3b²)/(2a), b), which is within the rectangle.\n\nHowever, if √3 b > a ≥ b, then the intersection with y = b is outside the rectangle, so the line ax - by = C intersects the rectangle only at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and somewhere on x = a?\n\nLet me check intersection with x = a:\n\nax - by = C => a² - b y = (a² + b²)/2 => -b y = -a²/2 + b²/2 => y = (a² - b²)/(2b). Since a ≥ b, this y is positive. Check if it is ≤ b:\n\n(a² - b²)/(2b) ≤ b => a² - b² ≤ 2b² => a² ≤ 3b² => a ≤ √3 b. Which is exactly our condition here. Therefore, for b ≤ a ≤ √3 b, the line ax - by = C intersects the rectangle at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and (a, (a² - b²)/(2b)).\n\nTherefore, in Case 1 (a ≥ b), we have two subcases:\n\nSubcase 1a: a ≥ √3 b. The line ax - by = C intersects the rectangle at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and ((a² + 3b²)/(2a), b).\n\nSubcase 1b: b ≤ a ≤ √3 b. The line ax - by = C intersects the rectangle at ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and (a, (a² - b²)/(2b)).\n\nThis complicates things further. Therefore, perhaps I need to handle these subcases separately. However, given that the problem asks for a general k, which is a/b, I need to find an expression that works for all k ≥ 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better approach by using coordinates transformation or by observing that the region is a polygon whose vertices can be determined based on the intersections, and then compute its area accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about probability, maybe we can use coordinate normalization. Let me set b = 1 (since the ratio k = a/b is given, so set b = 1, then a = k). Therefore, let me let b = 1, so a = k. Then, the rectangle has width 2a = 2k and height 2b = 2. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 4k.\n\nNow, the region we want is defined by |kx + y| < (k² + 1)/2 and |kx - y| < (k² + 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, with this substitution, let me re-express the problem.\n\nIn the first quadrant (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0), the inequalities are:\n\nkx + y < (k² + 1)/2,\n\nand\n\n|kx - y| < (k² + 1)/2.\n\nWhich breaks down to:\n\nkx + y < (k² + 1)/2,\n\nand\n\n- (k² + 1)/2 < kx - y < (k² + 1)/2.\n\nBut since x, y ≥ 0, the second inequality becomes:\n\nkx - y > - (k² + 1)/2,\n\nand\n\nkx - y < (k² + 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, combining with the first inequality, we have:\n\nkx + y < (k² + 1)/2,\n\nand\n\n- (k² + 1)/2 < kx - y < (k² + 1)/2.\n\nBut perhaps we can find the intersection of these inequalities in the first quadrant.\n\nLet me consider solving for y from the inequalities.\n\nFrom the first inequality:\n\ny < (k² + 1)/2 - kx.\n\nFrom the second inequality:\n\n- (k² + 1)/2 < kx - y < (k² + 1)/2.\n\nLet me split into two:\n\nLower bound: - (k² + 1)/2 < kx - y => y < kx + (k² + 1)/2.\n\nUpper bound: kx - y < (k² + 1)/2 => y > kx - (k² + 1)/2.\n\nBut since y ≥ 0, we have y > max(kx - (k² + 1)/2, 0).\n\nTherefore, combining with the first inequality, in the first quadrant, the region is defined by:\n\nmax(kx - (k² + 1)/2, 0) < y < min( (k² + 1)/2 - kx, 1).\n\nBecause y is also limited by the rectangle's top at y = 1 (since b = 1).\n\nTherefore, to find the area in the first quadrant, we need to integrate over x from 0 to some upper limit, the difference between the upper and lower bounds of y.\n\nHowever, determining the limits of integration requires knowing where the bounds intersect the rectangle and each other.\n\nThis seems complex, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find the x-values where the upper bound (k² + 1)/2 - kx equals 1 (the top of the rectangle):\n\n(k² + 1)/2 - kx = 1 => kx = (k² + 1)/2 - 1 = (k² + 1 - 2)/2 = (k² - 1)/2 => x = (k² - 1)/(2k).\n\nThis x must be within [0, k]. Let's check:\n\nFor k ≥ 1, (k² - 1)/(2k) = (k/2 - 1/(2k)). Since k ≥ 1, this is ≥ (1/2 - 1/2) = 0. And for k approaching infinity, it approaches k/2, which is less than k. Therefore, valid.\n\nSimilarly, find where the lower bound kx - (k² + 1)/2 equals 0:\n\nkx - (k² + 1)/2 = 0 => x = (k² + 1)/(2k) = k/2 + 1/(2k).\n\nThis x must be within [0, k]. For k ≥ 1, this is clearly positive and less than k/2 + 1/(2*1) = k/2 + 1/2, which is less than k for k ≥ 1.\n\nTherefore, the region in the first quadrant can be divided into intervals based on these x-values.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nx1 = (k² - 1)/(2k): the x where upper bound meets y = 1.\n\nx2 = (k² + 1)/(2k): the x where lower bound meets y = 0.\n\nBut note that x2 is greater than x1 because:\n\n(k² + 1)/(2k) - (k² - 1)/(2k) = [ (k² + 1) - (k² - 1) ] / (2k) = 2 / (2k) = 1/k > 0.\n\nTherefore, x1 < x2.\n\nHowever, depending on the value of k, x2 might be within the rectangle's x-range [0, k] or not? Wait, x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k) = k/2 + 1/(2k). For k ≥ 1, this is always less than k/2 + 1/2 < k/2 + k/2 = k (since 1/(2k) < k/2 for k > 1). Wait, for k = 1, x2 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1, which is equal to k. For k > 1, x2 < k. Therefore, x2 is within [0, k].\n\nTherefore, the first quadrant region can be split into two parts:\n\n1. From x = 0 to x = x1, where the upper bound is y < (k² + 1)/2 - kx and the lower bound is y > 0 (since kx - (k² + 1)/2 is negative here).\n\n2. From x = x1 to x = x2, where the upper bound is y < 1 and the lower bound is y > kx - (k² + 1)/2.\n\n3. From x = x2 to x = k, the lower bound y > 0 would be above the lower bound kx - (k² + 1)/2, but need to check if the upper bound is still valid.\n\nWait, actually, need to check if for x beyond x2, the upper bound (k² + 1)/2 - kx is still above y = 0? Let's see:\n\nAt x = x2, (k² + 1)/2 - kx2 = (k² + 1)/2 - k*( (k² + 1)/(2k) ) = (k² + 1)/2 - (k² + 1)/2 = 0. Therefore, beyond x2, the upper bound becomes negative, which is below y ≥ 0. Therefore, the region only exists up to x = x2.\n\nTherefore, in summary, in the first quadrant, the region is from x = 0 to x = x2, with two subintervals:\n\n- From 0 to x1: y between 0 and (k² + 1)/2 - kx.\n\n- From x1 to x2: y between kx - (k² + 1)/2 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the area in the first quadrant is:\n\nA1 = ∫ from 0 to x1 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx - 0 ] dx + ∫ from x1 to x2 [ 1 - (kx - (k² + 1)/2 ) ] dx.\n\nLet me compute these integrals.\n\nFirst integral:\n\n∫₀^{x1} [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nThe antiderivative is [ (k² + 1)/2 * x - (k/2)x² ] from 0 to x1.\n\nSecond integral:\n\n∫_{x1}^{x2} [ 1 - kx + (k² + 1)/2 ] dx = ∫_{x1}^{x2} [ (1 + (k² + 1)/2 ) - kx ] dx.\n\nSimplify the constant term:\n\n1 + (k² + 1)/2 = (2 + k² + 1)/2 = (k² + 3)/2.\n\nTherefore, the second integral becomes:\n\n∫_{x1}^{x2} [ (k² + 3)/2 - kx ] dx.\n\nCompute antiderivative:\n\n[ (k² + 3)/2 * x - (k/2)x² ] from x1 to x2.\n\nNow, let me compute these expressions.\n\nFirst, let's compute x1 and x2:\n\nx1 = (k² - 1)/(2k),\n\nx2 = (k² + 1)/(2k).\n\nLet me compute the first integral:\n\nA1_first = [ (k² + 1)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1² ].\n\nSimilarly, the second integral:\n\nA1_second = [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² ] - [ (k² + 3)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1² ].\n\nTherefore, total area in first quadrant:\n\nA1 = A1_first + A1_second = [ (k² + 1)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1² ] + [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² - (k² + 3)/2 * x1 + (k/2)x1² ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe - (k/2)x1² and + (k/2)x1² cancel out.\n\nTherefore:\n\nA1 = [ (k² + 1)/2 * x1 ] + [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² - (k² + 3)/2 * x1 ].\n\nGroup terms:\n\nA1 = [ (k² + 1)/2 - (k² + 3)/2 ] * x1 + [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² ].\n\nSimplify the coefficient of x1:\n\n[ (k² + 1 - k² - 3)/2 ] * x1 = [ (-2)/2 ] * x1 = -x1.\n\nTherefore:\n\nA1 = -x1 + [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² ].\n\nNow compute this expression.\n\nFirst, substitute x1 = (k² - 1)/(2k) and x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k).\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: -x1 = - (k² - 1)/(2k).\n\nSecond term: (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2².\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me denote x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k).\n\nCompute term1 = (k² + 3)/2 * x2:\n\n= (k² + 3)/2 * (k² + 1)/(2k) = [(k² + 3)(k² + 1)] / (4k).\n\nCompute term2 = (k/2)x2²:\n\n= (k/2) * [ (k² + 1)^2 / (4k²) ] = [k * (k² + 1)^2 ] / (8k²) = (k² + 1)^2 / (8k).\n\nTherefore, the second term is term1 - term2:\n\n[(k² + 3)(k² + 1) / (4k)] - [(k² + 1)^2 / (8k)].\n\nFactor out (k² + 1)/(8k):\n\n= [2(k² + 3)(k² + 1) - (k² + 1)^2 ] / (8k).\n\nFactor out (k² + 1):\n\n= [ (k² + 1) [ 2(k² + 3) - (k² + 1) ] ] / (8k).\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2(k² + 3) - (k² + 1) = 2k² + 6 - k² - 1 = k² + 5.\n\nTherefore, the second term becomes:\n\n(k² + 1)(k² + 5) / (8k).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nA1 = - (k² - 1)/(2k) + (k² + 1)(k² + 5)/(8k).\n\nLet me combine these terms:\n\nConvert - (k² - 1)/(2k) to -4(k² - 1)/(8k) to have the same denominator:\n\nA1 = [ -4(k² - 1) + (k² + 1)(k² + 5) ] / (8k).\n\nNow compute the numerator:\n\n-4(k² - 1) + (k² + 1)(k² + 5).\n\nFirst expand (k² + 1)(k² + 5):\n\n= k^4 + 5k² + k² + 5 = k^4 + 6k² + 5.\n\nThen subtract 4(k² - 1):\n\n= k^4 + 6k² + 5 - 4k² + 4 = k^4 + 2k² + 9.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, it's -4(k² - 1) added to the above. So:\n\nk^4 + 6k² + 5 - 4k² + 4 ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, original expression:\n\n-4(k² - 1) + k^4 + 6k² + 5.\n\nWhich is k^4 + 6k² + 5 - 4k² + 4 ?\n\nWait, no, -4(k² - 1) = -4k² + 4. Therefore:\n\nk^4 + 6k² + 5 - 4k² + 4 = k^4 + 2k² + 9.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nYes:\n\nk^4 + 6k² + 5 - 4k² + 4 = k^4 + (6k² - 4k²) + (5 + 4) = k^4 + 2k² + 9.\n\nTherefore, numerator is k^4 + 2k² + 9.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again because when I expanded (k² + 1)(k² + 5), I think I might have made an error.\n\nWait, (k² + 1)(k² + 5) = k²*k² + k²*5 + 1*k² + 1*5 = k^4 + 5k² + k² + 5 = k^4 + 6k² + 5. Correct. Then adding -4k² + 4 gives k^4 + 6k² + 5 - 4k² + 4 = k^4 + 2k² + 9. Correct.\n\nTherefore, A1 = (k^4 + 2k² + 9) / (8k).\n\nWait, but this seems odd. Let me check with a specific value of k where I can compute manually. For example, let's take k = 1 (square case). If k = 1, then the rectangle is a square, and the region closer to center than to any vertex should be the square diamond entirely inside the square.\n\nFor k = 1, let's compute A1:\n\nNumerator: 1^4 + 2*1^2 + 9 = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12.\n\nDenominator: 8*1 = 8.\n\nThus, A1 = 12 / 8 = 3/2.\n\nBut the total area in the first quadrant of the square should be 1/4 of the diamond's area. The diamond in the square (k=1) has vertices at ((1 + 1)/2, 0) = (1, 0), similarly (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1). But since the square has side 2 (from -1 to 1 in x and y), the diamond is the square rotated by 45 degrees with vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), etc. The area of this diamond is 2 (since area of square rotated by 45 degrees with diagonals of length 2√2? Wait, no. Wait, the diamond has diagonals of length 2 (along x-axis and y-axis). The area of a rhombus is (d1*d2)/2 = (2*2)/2 = 2. Therefore, total area is 2, so area in first quadrant is 2/4 = 0.5. However, according to our calculation, A1 = 3/2 = 1.5, which is three times larger. This indicates an error in my calculation.\n\nClearly, there is a mistake here. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nFirst, when k = 1, x1 = (1 - 1)/(2*1) = 0. x2 = (1 + 1)/(2*1) = 1. Therefore, the first integral from 0 to x1 = 0 is zero. The second integral is from x1 = 0 to x2 = 1 of [ (k² + 3)/2 - kx ] dx. Wait, no:\n\nWait, when k = 1, the second integral is from x1 to x2, which is from 0 to 1 of [ (k² + 3)/2 - kx ] dx. For k = 1, this becomes [ (1 + 3)/2 - 1*x ] dx from 0 to 1, i.e., [2 - x] dx from 0 to 1. The integral is [2x - x²/2] from 0 to 1 = 2(1) - 1/2 - 0 = 2 - 1/2 = 3/2. Then A1 = 3/2. But since in reality, the area in the first quadrant should be 0.5, this suggests that my calculation is wrong.\n\nWhere is the mistake? Let me check.\n\nEarlier, I said that A1 = -x1 + [ ... ]. But with k = 1, x1 = 0, so A1 = 0 + [ ... ] which was computed as 3/2, but the correct area is 0.5. Therefore, my mistake must be in the derivation of A1.\n\nLet me go back. When I combined the integrals, I think I made an error.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nA1 = [ (k² + 1)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1² ] + [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² - (k² + 3)/2 * x1 + (k/2)x1² ].\n\nThen I said that - (k/2)x1² and + (k/2)x1² cancel. However, in the second bracket, it's - (k² + 3)/2 * x1 + (k/2)x1². Wait, no, the second integral was:\n\nA1_second = [term evaluated at x2] - [term evaluated at x1] = [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² ] - [ (k² + 3)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1² ].\n\nTherefore, when adding A1_first + A1_second, it's:\n\nA1_first + [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² - (k² + 3)/2 * x1 + (k/2)x1² ].\n\nBut A1_first is [ (k² + 1)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1² ].\n\nTherefore, total A1 = [ (k² + 1)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1² ] + [ (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² - (k² + 3)/2 * x1 + (k/2)x1² ].\n\nNotice that - (k/2)x1² and + (k/2)x1² cancel, so we have:\n\nA1 = (k² + 1)/2 * x1 + (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2² - (k² + 3)/2 * x1.\n\nThen grouping terms:\n\n= [ (k² + 1)/2 - (k² + 3)/2 ] * x1 + (k² + 3)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2².\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n= [ -2/2 * x1 ] + ... = -x1 + ... \n\nSo that part was correct.\n\nBut with k = 1, x1 = 0, so A1 = 0 + [ (1 + 3)/2 * x2 - (1/2)x2² ].\n\nWith x2 = 1, this becomes [ (4/2)*1 - (1/2)*1² ] = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5, which contradicts the known correct value of 0.5. Therefore, there must be an error in the setup of the integrals.\n\nLet me check the setup again. The area in the first quadrant was claimed to be:\n\nA1 = ∫ from 0 to x1 [upper - lower] dx + ∫ from x1 to x2 [upper - lower] dx.\n\nBut with k = 1, x1 = 0, x2 = 1. The upper bound for x from 0 to x1 (which is 0) is trivial, so A1_first = 0. The upper bound from x1 to x2 is y < 1, and lower bound is y > kx - (k² + 1)/2 = x - (1 + 1)/2 = x - 1. But since x is between 0 and 1, x - 1 ranges from -1 to 0. Therefore, the lower bound is y > max(x - 1, 0) = 0. Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1 of [1 - 0] dx = 1 * 1 = 1. But according to my previous calculation, it was 1.5, which is wrong. Therefore, my mistake was in the second integral's setup.\n\nWait, previously I said that the second integral was ∫ [ (k² + 3)/2 - kx ] dx, but that seems incorrect. Let me go back to the derivation.\n\nEarlier, I said that in the second integral, the expression is ∫ [ (k² + 3)/2 - kx ] dx. Where did this come from?\n\nInitially, I said that the second integral is ∫ [1 - (kx - (k² + 1)/2 ) ] dx = ∫ [1 - kx + (k² + 1)/2 ] dx = ∫ [ (1 + (k² + 1)/2 ) - kx ] dx = ∫ [ (k² + 3)/2 - kx ] dx. But for k = 1, this becomes ∫ [ (1 + 3)/2 - x ] dx = ∫ [2 - x] dx from 0 to 1, which gives [2x - x²/2] from 0 to 1 = 2 - 1/2 = 3/2, but the correct value should be ∫ [1 - 0] dx = 1. Therefore, there is a mistake here.\n\nThe error is in the assumption that the upper bound is 1 and the lower bound is kx - (k² + 1)/2. But actually, the upper bound is min( (k² + 1)/2 - kx, 1 ), and the lower bound is max( kx - (k² + 1)/2, 0 ). Therefore, in the second integral, from x1 to x2, the upper bound is 1 and the lower bound is kx - (k² + 1)/2, but only if kx - (k² + 1)/2 ≤ 1. However, for k = 1 and x from 0 to 1, the lower bound is x - 1, which ranges from -1 to 0, so max(x - 1, 0) = 0. Therefore, the integral should be ∫ [1 - 0] dx = 1. But according to my previous calculation, I incorrectly included the (k² + 3)/2 term, which is wrong.\n\nWhere did this error come from? Let me re-express the second integral correctly.\n\nThe upper bound is min( (k² + 1)/2 - kx, 1 ). For x from x1 to x2, we have (k² + 1)/2 - kx ≤ 1. Therefore, the upper bound is (k² + 1)/2 - kx. Wait, no! Earlier, we found that x1 is the x where (k² + 1)/2 - kx = 1. For x > x1, (k² + 1)/2 - kx < 1. But in the region x ≥ x1, the upper bound is still (k² + 1)/2 - kx, but since this is less than 1, and the rectangle's upper limit is y ≤ 1, the upper bound is actually (k² + 1)/2 - kx. Wait, but if (k² + 1)/2 - kx is less than 1, then the upper bound is that value, not 1. Wait, no! Wait, originally, the upper bound is min( (k² + 1)/2 - kx, 1 ). But for x from x1 to x2, we have (k² + 1)/2 - kx ≤ 1, so the upper bound is (k² + 1)/2 - kx, not 1. But earlier, I thought that the upper bound was 1, but that's incorrect. The upper bound is still (k² + 1)/2 - kx, which is less than 1, and the lower bound is kx - (k² + 1)/2, but since this is negative, the lower bound is 0. Therefore, the integral should be ∫ from x1 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx - 0 ] dx.\n\nWait, this is a critical mistake! Earlier, I incorrectly assumed that the upper bound was 1, but it's actually (k² + 1)/2 - kx. Therefore, the second integral should be the same as the first integral, but from x1 to x2. Therefore, the entire area in the first quadrant is just ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx - max( kx - (k² + 1)/2, 0 ) ] dx.\n\nBut since for x from 0 to x2, the lower bound is max( kx - (k² + 1)/2, 0 ). For x from 0 to x2, kx - (k² + 1)/2 is negative because at x = x2, it's zero, and for x < x2, it's more negative. Therefore, the lower bound is 0 for all x from 0 to x2. Therefore, the entire area in the first quadrant is ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous subdivision into x1 and x2. What is x1? Earlier, x1 was defined as the x where (k² + 1)/2 - kx = 1, but if the upper bound is always (k² + 1)/2 - kx, and we are integrating up to x2 where (k² + 1)/2 - kx = 0, then x1 is the x where (k² + 1)/2 - kx = 1, which may or may not be less than x2.\n\nWait, for k = 1, x1 = (1 - 1)/2 = 0, and x2 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1. Therefore, for k = 1, the upper bound (k² + 1)/2 - kx is 1 - x, which goes from 1 to 0 as x goes from 0 to 1. Therefore, the area is ∫ from 0 to 1 (1 - x) dx = [x - x²/2] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, which is correct. Therefore, my earlier mistake was incorrectly splitting the integral into two parts, when actually, for all x from 0 to x2, the lower bound is 0, and the upper bound is (k² + 1)/2 - kx, so the entire area is just ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx.\n\nBut why did I think there was a x1? Because I mistakenly thought that for x > x1, the upper bound is 1, but that is not the case. The upper bound is always (k² + 1)/2 - kx, which for x from 0 to x2 goes from (k² + 1)/2 down to 0. Therefore, the correct area in the first quadrant is:\n\nA1 = ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx, where x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k).\n\nLet me compute this integral.\n\nThe antiderivative is [ (k² + 1)/2 * x - (k/2)x² ] evaluated from 0 to x2.\n\nPlugging in x2:\n\nA1 = (k² + 1)/2 * x2 - (k/2)x2².\n\nNow substitute x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k):\n\nA1 = (k² + 1)/2 * (k² + 1)/(2k) - (k/2) * [(k² + 1)/(2k)]².\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: [(k² + 1)^2]/(4k).\n\nSecond term: (k/2) * (k² + 1)^2/(4k²) = (k² + 1)^2 / (8k).\n\nTherefore, A1 = [(k² + 1)^2 / (4k)] - [(k² + 1)^2 / (8k)] = (k² + 1)^2 / (8k).\n\nNow, let's check with k = 1: (1 + 1)^2 / (8*1) = 4/8 = 1/2, which is correct. Great!\n\nTherefore, the area in the first quadrant is (k² + 1)^2 / (8k). Since the region is symmetric in all four quadrants, the total area is 4 * A1 = 4 * (k² + 1)^2 / (8k) = (k² + 1)^2 / (2k).\n\nBut wait, this is the total area of the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex? Let me verify with k = 1 (square). Total area would be (1 + 1)^2 / (2*1) = 4/2 = 2, which matches the area of the diamond (which we said was 2). Therefore, correct.\n\nHowever, this result assumes that the entire diamond is within the rectangle, but earlier analysis showed that for k > 1, the diamond extends beyond the rectangle in the y-direction. However, in this calculation, we set x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k), which for the upper bound of x in the first quadrant is x2, but what about the y-bound? For example, in the first quadrant, the upper y is 1 (since b = 1), but the calculation assumes that (k² + 1)/2 - kx is always ≤ 1 for x from 0 to x2. Is this true?\n\nLet me check for general k ≥ 1. The maximum value of (k² + 1)/2 - kx occurs at x = 0, which is (k² + 1)/2. We need to ensure that this is ≤ 1 (the top of the rectangle), but for k ≥ 1, (k² + 1)/2 ≥ (1 + 1)/2 = 1, with equality only when k = 1. For k > 1, (k² + 1)/2 > 1, which means that at x = 0, the upper bound y < (k² + 1)/2 exceeds the rectangle's top y = 1. Therefore, my previous calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the upper bound is always within the rectangle, but for k > 1, this is not the case. The error arises because for k > 1, the line ax + by = C intersects the rectangle's top side y = 1 at x1 = (k² - 1)/(2k), and beyond x1, the upper bound should be y = 1, not (k² + 1)/2 - kx.\n\nThis means that my previous correction was incomplete. I need to properly account for the fact that for k > 1, the upper bound is min( (k² + 1)/2 - kx, 1 ), and therefore, the integral must be split into two parts: from x = 0 to x = x1, where the upper bound is (k² + 1)/2 - kx, and from x = x1 to x = x2, where the upper bound is 1. The lower bound remains 0 in both cases, since kx - (k² + 1)/2 is negative for x ≤ x2.\n\nThis brings us back to the original split into x1 and x2, but with the correct expression for the second integral.\n\nLet me recompute the area in the first quadrant, properly accounting for the two regions.\n\nFirst quadrant area A1 = ∫ from 0 to x1 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx + ∫ from x1 to x2 [ 1 - 0 ] dx.\n\nWhere x1 = (k² - 1)/(2k), x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k).\n\nCompute first integral:\n\n∫ from 0 to x1 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx = [ (k² + 1)/2 * x - (k/2)x² ] from 0 to x1 = (k² + 1)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1².\n\nSecond integral:\n\n∫ from x1 to x2 [1] dx = x2 - x1.\n\nTherefore, A1 = (k² + 1)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1² + x2 - x1.\n\nNow, substitute x1 and x2:\n\nx1 = (k² - 1)/(2k), x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k).\n\nFirst, compute (k² + 1)/2 * x1:\n\n= (k² + 1)/2 * (k² - 1)/(2k) = [(k^4 - 1)/4k].\n\nNext, compute (k/2)x1²:\n\n= (k/2) * [(k² - 1)^2 / (4k²)] = (k/2) * (k^4 - 2k² + 1) / (4k²) = (k^4 - 2k² + 1) / (8k).\n\nThen, x2 - x1 = [(k² + 1)/(2k) - (k² - 1)/(2k)] = [ (k² + 1 - k² + 1) / (2k) ] = 2/(2k) = 1/k.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nA1 = [(k^4 - 1)/4k] - [(k^4 - 2k² + 1)/8k] + 1/k.\n\nLet me combine these terms. First, express all terms with denominator 8k:\n\n= [2(k^4 - 1)/8k] - [(k^4 - 2k² + 1)/8k] + 8/(8k).\n\nCombine numerators:\n\n[2(k^4 - 1) - (k^4 - 2k² + 1) + 8] / (8k).\n\nExpand the numerator:\n\n2k^4 - 2 - k^4 + 2k² - 1 + 8 = (2k^4 - k^4) + 2k² + (-2 - 1 + 8) = k^4 + 2k² + 5.\n\nTherefore, A1 = (k^4 + 2k² + 5) / (8k).\n\nNow, let's verify with k = 1:\n\nA1 = (1 + 2 + 5)/8 = 8/8 = 1. But wait, the correct area in the first quadrant for k = 1 is 0.5. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, no, when k = 1, x1 = (1 - 1)/2 = 0, so the first integral is 0, and the second integral is x2 - x1 = 1 - 0 = 1. But the correct area is 0.5. This indicates another error.\n\nWait, when k = 1, the upper bound for the second integral should be from x1 = 0 to x2 = 1, but the upper bound is 1, and the lower bound is 0, so the area should be ∫ from 0 to 1 [1 - 0] dx = 1. But in reality, for the square, the area in the first quadrant is 0.5. This suggests that my current expression for A1 is incorrect.\n\nBut why? Because when k = 1, the region defined by |kx + y| < (k² + 1)/2 and |kx - y| < (k² + 1)/2 is the diamond, which has area 2, so first quadrant area is 0.5. But according to this calculation, A1 = 1. This suggests that there is an error in the limits or in the understanding of the region.\n\nWait, when k = 1, the region in the first quadrant is bounded by kx + y < 1, and |kx - y| < 1. But with k = 1, this becomes x + y < 1 and |x - y| < 1. Let's analyze this.\n\nThe inequalities x + y < 1 and |x - y| < 1 in the first quadrant (x, y ≥ 0).\n\nThe |x - y| < 1 is equivalent to -1 < x - y < 1, which in the first quadrant simplifies to x - y > -1 (always true since x, y ≥ 0, x - y ≥ -y ≥ -∞, but combined with x + y < 1, and x - y < 1.\n\nBut x - y < 1 is always true since x < 1 - y ≤ 1, and y ≥ 0, so x - y < 1 - y - y = 1 - 2y ≤ 1.\n\nWait, actually, for x, y ≥ 0 and x + y < 1, the maximum value of x - y is when x is maximum and y is minimum, i.e., x approaches 1 and y approaches 0, giving x - y approaches 1. Therefore, the inequality x - y < 1 is automatically satisfied. The other inequality is x - y > -1, which is also always true since x - y > -y ≥ -∞, but with x + y < 1, we can derive x - y > -1.\n\nIndeed, from x + y < 1 and x, y ≥ 0, we have x - y = (x + y) - 2y < 1 - 2y. Since y ≥ 0, this is ≤ 1, but also, x - y > -y (since x ≥ 0). But to ensure x - y > -1, we need -y > -1 => y < 1, which is true since x + y < 1 and x ≥ 0 implies y < 1. Therefore, the region is defined by x + y < 1 in the first quadrant, which is a triangle with area 0.5. But according to my calculation, A1 = 1. This suggests that my limits are incorrect.\n\nWait, in the case of k = 1, x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k) = (1 + 1)/2 = 1. Therefore, the integral ∫ from 0 to x2 [1 - 0] dx = 1, but the actual area is 0.5. This implies that my upper bound is incorrect. The upper bound should not be 1, but rather the minimum of 1 and (k² + 1)/2 - kx. But when k = 1, (k² + 1)/2 - kx = 1 - x, and we are integrating from 0 to x2 = 1, where at x = 0, the upper bound is 1, and at x = 1, it is 0. Therefore, the integral should be ∫ from 0 to 1 (1 - x) dx = 0.5, not 1. But according to my current setup, I have ∫ from x1 to x2 [1 - 0] dx, where x1 = 0, x2 = 1, giving 1. This suggests that I incorrectly set the upper bound as 1, but it should be (k² + 1)/2 - kx, which for k = 1 is 1 - x. Therefore, the correct expression for A1 is ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx, which for k = 1 gives 0.5, as desired. But previously, when I tried to split the integral, I mistakenly used 1 as the upper bound in part of the integral, leading to errors.\n\nLet me go back. The correct area in the first quadrant is ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx, where x2 is the x where (k² + 1)/2 - kx = 0, i.e., x2 = (k² + 1)/(2k). This integral gives the correct result for k = 1, as we saw. For k > 1, this integral may or may not be fully inside the rectangle. Wait, but for k > 1, at x = 0, the upper bound is (k² + 1)/2, which is greater than 1 (since k > 1). Therefore, the line kx + y = (k² + 1)/2 intersects the rectangle's top side y = 1 at x1 = (k² - 1)/(2k). Therefore, the correct area should be ∫ from 0 to x1 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx + ∫ from x1 to x2 [1 - 0] dx, where x1 is the x where the line meets y = 1, and x2 is where it meets y = 0. But in this case, the first integral is from 0 to x1, and the second is from x1 to x2. However, when I calculated this, for k = 1, x1 = 0, and the second integral becomes ∫ from 0 to x2 [1 - 0] dx, which is incorrect, as it should be ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx. This suggests that my x1 is defined differently.\n\nLet me redefine x1 as the x where (k² + 1)/2 - kx = 1, which is x1 = (k² + 1)/2k - 1/k = (k² + 1 - 2)/2k = (k² - 1)/2k, as before. For k > 1, this x1 is positive. For x from 0 to x1, the upper bound is (k² + 1)/2 - kx, and for x from x1 to x2, the upper bound is 1. Therefore, the correct area is:\n\nA1 = ∫ from 0 to x1 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx + ∫ from x1 to x2 [1] dx.\n\nLet me compute this for general k ≥ 1.\n\nFirst integral: [ (k² + 1)/2 * x - (k/2)x² ] from 0 to x1.\n\nSecond integral: x2 - x1.\n\nAs before, let's compute this.\n\nFirst, compute the first integral:\n\nAt x1 = (k² - 1)/(2k), the first integral is:\n\n(k² + 1)/2 * x1 - (k/2)x1².\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me denote x1 = (k² - 1)/(2k).\n\nFirst term: (k² + 1)/2 * x1 = (k² + 1)/2 * (k² - 1)/(2k) = [(k^4 - 1)/4k].\n\nSecond term: (k/2)x1² = (k/2) * [(k² - 1)^2 / (4k²)] = [(k² - 1)^2]/(8k).\n\nTherefore, first integral = [(k^4 - 1)/4k] - [(k^4 - 2k² + 1)/8k] = [2(k^4 - 1) - (k^4 - 2k² + 1)] / 8k = [2k^4 - 2 - k^4 + 2k² - 1] / 8k = [k^4 + 2k² - 3] / 8k.\n\nSecond integral: x2 - x1 = [(k² + 1)/(2k) - (k² - 1)/(2k)] = [2/(2k)] = 1/k.\n\nTherefore, total A1 = [k^4 + 2k² - 3]/8k + 1/k = [k^4 + 2k² - 3 + 8]/8k = [k^4 + 2k² + 5]/8k.\n\nWait, this is the same result as before! But for k = 1, this gives [1 + 2 + 5]/8 = 8/8 = 1, which is incorrect. What is the issue here?\n\nWhen k = 1, x1 = (1 - 1)/2 = 0, x2 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1. The first integral is from 0 to 0, which is 0, and the second integral is 1 - 0 = 1. But the correct area is 0.5. This suggests that the second integral should not be 1, but rather the integral of (1 - 0) from x1 to x2, but with x2 = 1, it is 1, but the correct area is 0.5. This implies that the upper limit x2 is not (k² + 1)/(2k) but something else.\n\nWait, when k = 1, the line kx + y = (k² + 1)/2 is x + y = 1, which meets y = 1 at x = 0, and meets x-axis at x = 1. Therefore, in this case, the region in the first quadrant is the triangle under x + y < 1, which has area 0.5. However, according to our calculation, it is 1, which is wrong. The error is in the second integral, which is from x1 to x2 of 1 dx, but this is incorrect because the region is not the full rectangle from x1 to x2, but the region under the line. When k = 1, x1 = 0, x2 = 1, but the region is under x + y < 1, which is a triangle, not a rectangle. Therefore, my mistake is in assuming that from x1 to x2, the upper bound is 1, but it is actually still the line (k² + 1)/2 - kx, which for k = 1 is 1 - x, and the lower bound is 0. Therefore, the correct area is ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx, which for k = 1 gives 0.5, as it should. The error in the previous calculation was introducing x1 and incorrectly splitting the integral, leading to incorrect results.\n\nTherefore, the correct area in the first quadrant is:\n\nA1 = ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx = [(k² + 1)^2 / (8k)].\n\nBut for k > 1, this integral may extend beyond the rectangle's top edge y = 1, but in reality, the upper bound is min( (k² + 1)/2 - kx, 1). Therefore, to correctly compute the area, we need to determine if (k² + 1)/2 - kx ≤ 1 for all x in [0, x2], or if it exceeds 1 for some x.\n\nThe maximum value of (k² + 1)/2 - kx occurs at x = 0, which is (k² + 1)/2. This is greater than 1 for k > 1, so we need to find x1 such that (k² + 1)/2 - kx1 = 1, which is x1 = (k² - 1)/(2k), as before. Therefore, the correct area is:\n\nA1 = ∫ from 0 to x1 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx + ∫ from x1 to x2 [ 1 ] dx.\n\nBut when we calculated this, for k = 1, it gave 1, which is wrong. Let me recompute this for k = 1:\n\nx1 = (1 - 1)/2 = 0, x2 = 1. First integral is 0, second integral is 1. But the correct area is 0.5. This suggests that the upper limit x2 should not be (k² + 1)/(2k) but the x where the line kx - y = (k² + 1)/2 intersects the rectangle, which for the y-bound. Wait, no, x2 is where kx + y = (k² + 1)/2 intersects the x-axis, which is at y = 0, x = (k² + 1)/(2k). For k = 1, this is 1, but the region under kx + y < (k² + 1)/2 and |kx - y| < (k² + 1)/2 is the intersection with the rectangle. However, for k = 1, this intersection is the triangle under x + y < 1, which has area 0.5, but our calculation gives 1. This suggests that the region defined by |kx + y| < (k² + 1)/2 and |kx - y| < (k² + 1)/2 is actually the intersection of two regions, and in the first quadrant, it is the region under both kx + y < (k² + 1)/2 and kx - y < (k² + 1)/2 and -kx + y < (k² + 1)/2. But in the first quadrant, the last inequality is automatically satisfied, so it reduces to kx + y < (k² + 1)/2 and kx - y < (k² + 1)/2. But for k = 1, this is x + y < 1 and x - y < 1. The second inequality x - y < 1 is always true in the first quadrant, since x - y < x ≤ 1. Therefore, the region is just x + y < 1, which has area 0.5, but our integral calculation gives 1. This indicates that my limits are incorrect.\n\nThe problem is that the region is not just under kx + y < C, but also under |kx - y| < C. For k = 1, this adds the condition |x - y| < 1, which in the first quadrant is x - y < 1 (always true) and y - x < 1, which is y < x + 1 (also always true since y ≤ 1 and x ≥ 0). Therefore, for k = 1, the region is indeed x + y < 1, but my calculation of A1 as ∫ from 0 to x2 [ (k² + 1)/2 - kx ] dx = 0.5 is correct, but earlier when I split the integral, I got 1, which was a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation of A1 = [(k² + 1)^2 / (8k)] for k = 1: (1 + 1)^2 / (8*1) = 4/8 = 0.5, which is correct! Earlier, when I mistakenly split the integral and got 1, that was an error, but the correct expression is [(k² + 1)^2 / (8k)].\n\nTherefore, the correct area in the first quadrant is A1 = (k² + 1)^2 / (8k), and the total area is 4 * A1 = (k² + 1)^2 / (2k).\n\nBut wait, for k = 1, total area is (1 + 1)^2 / (2*1) = 4/2 = 2, which is correct, as the diamond has area 2. For k > 1, this total area is (k² + 1)^2 / (2k). However, we need to ensure that this area is fully within the rectangle. For example, when k is very large, say k approaches infinity, the rectangle becomes very wide. The total area of the region would be approximately (k^4)/2k = k^3/2, which grows faster than the area of the rectangle, which is 4k. This is impossible, indicating another error.\n\nWait, this suggests a fundamental mistake. The total area cannot exceed the area of the rectangle, which is 4ab = 4k (since b = 1, a = k). For k approaching infinity, (k² + 1)^2 / (2k) ≈ k^4 / (2k) = k^3/2, which is much larger than 4k. This is impossible, so there must be a mistake in the derivation.\n\nThe error must be in assuming that the region defined by |kx + y| < (k² + 1)/2 and |kx - y| < (k² + 1)/2 is entirely within the rectangle, which is not the case for k > 1. The calculation of A1 = (k² + 1)^2 / (8k) assumes that the entire region defined by these inequalities is within the rectangle, which is only true when the diamond is fully inside the rectangle, i.e., when k = 1. For k > 1, the region extends outside the rectangle, so the correct area is the intersection of the diamond with the rectangle, which is less than (k² + 1)^2 / (2k).\n\nThis suggests that my previous approach is incorrect, and I need to find a different method.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's consider that the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of four regions, each defined by being closer to O than to a vertex. For a rectangle, this region is a polygon whose vertices are the intersections of the perpendicular bisectors with the rectangle.\n\nGiven the symmetry, let's focus on the first quadrant and find the intersection points of the bisectors with the rectangle, then determine the polygon vertices.\n\nIn the first quadrant, the relevant bisectors are those between O and B (a, b) and between O and A (-a, b). The bisector between O and B is ax + by = (a² + b²)/2, and the bisector between O and A is ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2. However, in the first quadrant, the bisector between O and A is outside the rectangle, so the relevant bisector is between O and B.\n\nWait, no, in the first quadrant, the region closer to O than to B is below the bisector ax + by = (a² + b²)/2, and closer to O than to A is above the bisector ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2. But since we are in the first quadrant, let's check if these bisectors intersect the rectangle.\n\nFor the bisector between O and B: ax + by = (a² + b²)/2. In the first quadrant, this line intersects the x-axis at x = (a² + b²)/(2a) and the y-axis at y = (a² + b²)/(2b).\n\nFor the bisector between O and A: ax - by = - (a² + b²)/2. In the first quadrant, this line would intersect the y-axis at y = (ax + (a² + b²)/2)/b. At x = 0, y = (0 + (a² + b²)/2)/b = (a² + b²)/(2b). This is the same y-intercept as the bisector between O and B. However, this line also intersects the x-axis at x = - (a² + b²)/(2a), which is negative, outside the first quadrant. Therefore, in the first quadrant, the relevant part of this bisector is from (0, (a² + b²)/(2b)) to some point on the boundary of the first quadrant.\n\nBut since we are in the first quadrant, the region closer to O than to A is above this line, but since the line extends from (0, (a² + b²)/(2b)) to outside the first quadrant, in the first quadrant, the region closer to O than to A is all points above this line segment.\n\nTherefore, the region in the first quadrant where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is bounded by:\n\n- Below the bisector between O and B: ax + by < (a² + b²)/2.\n\n- Above the bisector between O and A: ax - by > - (a² + b²)/2.\n\n- And within the rectangle: 0 ≤ x ≤ a, 0 ≤ y ≤ b.\n\nThis region is a polygon whose vertices are the intersections of these lines with the rectangle.\n\nLet me find these intersection points.\n\nFirst, find where the bisector between O and B (ax + by = C, where C = (a² + b²)/2) intersects the rectangle in the first quadrant. As before, it intersects the x-axis at x = C/a = (a² + b²)/(2a) and the y-axis at y = C/b = (a² + b²)/(2b).\n\nSimilarly, the bisector between O and A (ax - by = -C) in the first quadrant intersects the y-axis at y = (ax + C)/b. At x = 0, this is y = C/b = (a² + b²)/(2b), same as above. To find where this line intersects the x-axis, set y = 0: ax - 0 = -C => x = -C/a, which is negative, outside the first quadrant. To find where it intersects the top edge y = b:\n\nax - b*b = -C => ax = -C + b² = - (a² + b²)/2 + b² = (-a² - b² + 2b²)/2 = (-a² + b²)/2.\n\nTherefore, x = (-a² + b²)/(2a). Since in Case 1, a ≥ b, this x is negative or zero, so it's outside the first quadrant. Therefore, in the first quadrant, the bisector between O and A intersects the rectangle only at (0, C/b).\n\nTherefore, the region in the first quadrant is bounded by:\n\n- From (0, 0) to the intersection of the bisector between O and B with the x-axis, but only if this x is ≤ a.\n\n- From (0, 0) to the intersection of the bisector between O and B with the y-axis, but only if this y is ≤ b.\n\nBut since for a ≥ b, the y-intercept of the bisector between O and B is (a² + b²)/(2b), which is greater than b (since a ≥ b), this point is outside the rectangle. Similarly, the x-intercept is (a² + b²)/(2a), which is ≤ a since a ≥ b.\n\nTherefore, in the first quadrant, the region is bounded by:\n\n- The bisector between O and B from x = 0 to x = (a² + b²)/(2a), y = 0 up to the line.\n\n- The top of the rectangle y = b from x = 0 to x where the line ax + by = C intersects y = b.\n\nWait, let me find where the line ax + by = C intersects y = b:\n\nax + b*b = C => x = (C - b²)/a = [(a² + b²)/2 - b²]/a = (a² - b²)/(2a).\n\nThis x is positive since a ≥ b.\n\nTherefore, in the first quadrant, the region is a polygon with vertices at:\n\n1. (0, 0) - but wait, is (0, 0) part of the region? At (0, 0), distance to O is 0, which is less than distance to any vertex. Yes.\n\nBut the region is bounded by the bisectors. Let me think. The region in the first quadrant is the set of points above the bisector between O and A and below the bisector between O and B.\n\nThe bisector between O and A in the first quadrant is from (0, C/b) down to outside the first quadrant, so within the first quadrant, it's just the point (0, C/b). However, since C/b = (a² + b²)/(2b) > b (since a ≥ b), this point is outside the rectangle. Therefore, within the rectangle, the region is bounded below by y = 0 and above by the line ax + by = C, and on the right by x = (a² - b²)/(2a) at y = b.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to draw it mentally. The region closer to O than to B is below the line ax + by = C. The region closer to O than to A is above the line ax - by = -C. In the first quadrant, the line ax - by = -C is from (0, C/b) to (-C/a, 0), but only (0, C/b) is in the first quadrant. Since C/b > b, this point is outside the rectangle. Therefore, within the rectangle, the condition ax - by > -C is always true because for any (x, y) in the first quadrant, ax - by ≥ -b² (when x=0, y=b), and -C = - (a² + b²)/2. Since -b² ≥ - (a² + b²)/2 (because a ≥ b, so a² ≥ b², so (a² + b²)/2 ≥ b²), this inequality is always satisfied. Therefore, in the first quadrant, the region closer to O than to any vertex is simply the region below the line ax + by = C and within the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the area in the first quadrant is the area under the line ax + by = C from x = 0 to x = (a² - b²)/(2a) at y = b, and from x = (a² - b²)/(2a) to x = (a² + b²)/(2a) at y = 0.\n\nWait, no. The line ax + by = C intersects the rectangle in the first quadrant at two points: on the x-axis at x = (a² + b²)/(2a) and on the y-axis at y = (a² + b²)/(2b) (outside the rectangle), and on the top edge at x = (a² - b²)/(2a), y = b.\n\nTherefore, the region in the first quadrant is a trapezoid with vertices at (0, 0), (0, b), ((a² - b²)/(2a), b), and ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0).\n\nWait, but (0, b) is not necessarily part of the region. Let me check.\n\nAt (0, b), the distance to O is sqrt(0 + b²) = b. The distance to vertex A (-a, b) is sqrt(a² + 0) = a. Since a ≥ b, the distance to O is less than the distance to A. Similarly, distance to B is sqrt(a² + 0) = a, which is greater than b. Distance to D is sqrt(a² + (2b)^2) which is larger. Therefore, (0, b) is closer to O than to any vertex. Therefore, (0, b) is part of the region.\n\nSimilarly, (0, 0) is part of the region.\n\nThe line ax + by = C passes through ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and ((a² - b²)/(2a), b). Therefore, the region in the first quadrant is a trapezoid with vertices at (0, 0), (0, b), ((a² - b²)/(2a), b), and ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0).\n\nThe area of this trapezoid can be calculated as the average of the two parallel sides multiplied by the distance between them. The two parallel sides are from (0, 0) to ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) on the x-axis, length L1 = (a² + b²)/(2a), and from (0, b) to ((a² - b²)/(2a), b), length L2 = (a² - b²)/(2a). The distance between these two sides is b (the height of the trapezoid).\n\nWait, no, in a trapezoid, the parallel sides are the two bases. Here, the bases are the segment on the x-axis from (0, 0) to ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0) and the segment on the line y = b from (0, b) to ((a² - b²)/(2a), b). These two segments are parallel? No, they are both horizontal, so yes, they are parallel. The height of the trapezoid is the vertical distance between y = 0 and y = b, which is b.\n\nTherefore, area = (L1 + L2)/2 * b = [ ( (a² + b²)/(2a) + (a² - b²)/(2a) ) / 2 ] * b = [ (2a²/(2a)) / 2 ] * b = [ (a/a) / 2 ] * b = (1/2) * b = b/2.\n\nWait, this is a constant? For any a and b, the area in the first quadrant is b/2? For example, when a = b (square), the area in the first quadrant should be 0.5, and since b = 1, it is 1/2, which is correct. For a > b, say a = 2, b = 1, the area in the first quadrant would be 1/2, and the total area would be 2, while the area of the rectangle is 4*2*1 = 8, giving probability 2/8 = 1/4. Let me check this with a specific example.\n\nLet a = 2, b = 1 (k = 2). The region in the first quadrant is a trapezoid with area 1/2. Total area is 4*(1/2) = 2. The area of the rectangle is 4*2*1 = 8. Probability is 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nLet me verify this by another method. For a = 2, b = 1, the region closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the four bisectors. The bisector between O and B (2, 1) is 2x + y = (4 + 1)/2 = 2.5. This line goes from (1.25, 0) to (0, 2.5), but since the rectangle goes up to y = 1, it intersects the top at y = 1 at x = (2.5 - 1)/2 = 0.75. Therefore, the trapezoid in the first quadrant has vertices at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0.75, 1), (1.25, 0). The area of this trapezoid is ((1.25 + 0.75)/2) * 1 = (2.0/2) * 1 = 1.0, which is 1/2 of the first quadrant of the rectangle (which is 2*1/4 = 0.5? Wait, no, the first quadrant of the rectangle is from x=0 to 2, y=0 to 1, area 2*1 = 2, so first quadrant area is 2, and the region is 1.0, which is 1/2 of the first quadrant, giving total region area 4*1.0 = 4, and probability 4/8 = 1/2. Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation of total area 2. There is a mistake here.\n\nWait, the trapezoid area is ((1.25 + 0.75)/2) * 1 = 1.0, and since the first quadrant of the rectangle has area 2, the probability contribution is 1.0/2 = 0.5, and total probability is 4 * 0.5 = 2, but the area of the region is 2, and the area of the rectangle is 8, giving probability 2/8 = 1/4, which is correct. My mistake was in thinking the trapezoid area is 1.0, which is half of the first quadrant's area of 2.0, so the total area is 4 * 1.0 = 4, but no, the total area is 4 * (1.0) = 4, but the total area of the rectangle is 8, so 4/8 = 1/2. Wait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let me calculate the trapezoid area again. The trapezoid has bases of length 1.25 (on x-axis) and 0.75 (on y=1), and height 1 (the vertical distance between y=0 and y=1). The area is (1.25 + 0.75)/2 * 1 = 2.0/2 * 1 = 1.0. The first quadrant of the rectangle has area 2*1 = 2.0, so the region is 1.0, which is half of the first quadrant. Therefore, total area is 4 * 1.0 = 4.0, and the probability is 4.0 / 8.0 = 0.5. But according to the previous formula (k² + 1)^2 / (2k) with k = 2, it would be (4 + 1)^2 / 4 = 25/4 = 6.25, which is greater than the area of the rectangle, which is clearly wrong. This indicates that the correct total area is 4.0 for k = 2, and the previous formula was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct area in the first quadrant is (L1 + L2)/2 * b, where L1 = (a² + b²)/(2a), L2 = (a² - b²)/(2a), and the height is b. Therefore, the area is [ ( (a² + b²)/(2a) + (a² - b²)/(2a) ) / 2 ] * b = [ (2a²/(2a)) / 2 ] * b = (a/a / 2) * b = (1/2) * b. Therefore, the area in the first quadrant is b/2, and total area is 4 * (b/2) = 2b.\n\nWait, for a = 2, b = 1, total area is 2*1 = 2, which matches the example calculation where the total area was 4.0? No, in the example, with a = 2, b = 1, the total area of the region is 4.0, but according to this formula, it's 2b = 2*1 = 2. There is a contradiction here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the example, the trapezoid area in the first quadrant was 1.0, and total area is 4 * 1.0 = 4.0. According to the formula, it should be 2b = 2*1 = 2.0. Where is the error?\n\nThe error is in the calculation of the trapezoid area. The trapezoid has bases of length L1 and L2, but these are along the x-axis and along y = b. However, the height of the trapezoid is not b, but the horizontal distance between the two bases? No, in a trapezoid, the height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases. Since the bases are horizontal, the height is the vertical distance, which is b. But in the example, with bases of 1.25 and 0.75, and height 1, the area is (1.25 + 0.75)/2 * 1 = 1.0, which is correct. If the first quadrant area is 2.0, then the region is 1.0, and total area is 4.0, while the formula says 2b = 2.0. This suggests that the formula is wrong.\n\nWait, where did the formula come from? I said that the area in the first quadrant is b/2, but in the example, it is 1.0, and b = 1, so 1.0 = b/2 implies b = 2, but b = 1. This is a contradiction. Let me re-derive the formula.\n\nThe trapezoid area is [(L1 + L2)/2] * height, where L1 = (a² + b²)/(2a), L2 = (a² - b²)/(2a), and height = b.\n\nSo:\n\nArea = [ ( (a² + b²)/(2a) + (a² - b²)/(2a) ) / 2 ] * b = [ (2a²/(2a)) / 2 ] * b = [ (a/a) / 2 ] * b = (1/2) * b.\n\nBut in the example, this gives 1/2 * 1 = 0.5, but the actual area is 1.0. Therefore, there is a mistake in the derivation.\n\nWait, the error is in the height. The height of the trapezoid is not b, but the distance between the two parallel sides. Since the two bases are on y = 0 and y = b, the height is b, but in the example, with bases of 1.25 and 0.75, and height 1, the area is 1.0, which is correct. According to the formula, it should be (1.25 + 0.75)/2 * 1 = 1.0, which is correct. But according to the general formula, it is (1/2) * b = 0.5, which is wrong. Where is the mistake in the general derivation?\n\nLet me recompute the general expression:\n\nL1 = (a² + b²)/(2a)\n\nL2 = (a² - b²)/(2a)\n\nAverage of L1 and L2: [ (a² + b² + a² - b²)/2a ] / 2 = [ 2a² / 2a ] / 2 = [ a / 1 ] / 2 = a/2.\n\nWait, no, the average of L1 and L2 is (L1 + L2)/2 = [ (a² + b² + a² - b²)/2a ] / 2? No, the average is (L1 + L2)/2 = [ (a² + b²)/(2a) + (a² - b²)/(2a) ] / 2 = [ (2a²)/(2a) ] / 2 = [ a ] / 2 = a/2.\n\nThen, multiply by the height b: (a/2) * b = (ab)/2.\n\nAh! I see, I made a mistake in the previous calculation. The area is (a/2) * b, not (1/2) * b. Therefore, the area in the first quadrant is (ab)/2, and the total area is 4 * (ab)/2 = 2ab. Since the area of the rectangle is 4ab, the probability is 2ab / 4ab = 1/2. But this is impossible, as for a square (a = b), the probability should be 2ab / 4ab = 1/2, but we know that in the square, the region is the diamond with area 2, and the rectangle has area 4, giving probability 2/4 = 1/2, which is correct. For the example with a = 2, b = 1, the total area of the region is 2ab = 2*2*1 = 4, and the rectangle has area 4*2*1 = 8, giving probability 4/8 = 1/2, which matches the example calculation. Therefore, the correct total area is 2ab, and the probability is 2ab / (4ab) = 1/2, independent of k? This cannot be, because for a very elongated rectangle, the region where points are closer to the center than to any vertex should be smaller.\n\nWait, this suggests that the probability is always 1/2, which contradicts intuition. For example, in a very long and narrow rectangle, most points should be closer to the center than to the vertices, but according to this, it's 1/2. Wait, no, actually, in a very long and narrow rectangle, the distance to the center might not be significantly different from the distance to the nearest vertex. Let me think with an example.\n\nTake a rectangle with a = 100, b = 1 (k = 100). The region where points are closer to O than to any vertex is 2ab = 2*100*1 = 200, and the area of the rectangle is 4*100*1 = 400, giving probability 1/2. This suggests that no matter how elongated the rectangle is, the probability is always 1/2, which seems counterintuitive, but mathematically, it might be correct.\n\nWait, let's take a point near the center, say (0, 0). It is closer to O than to any vertex. A point near the midpoint of the long side, say (0, 0). Wait, let's take a point (x, 0) on the x-axis. The distance to O is |x|. The distance to the nearest vertex is the distance to B (100, 1) or to D (-100, -1). The distance to B is sqrt((x - 100)^2 + 1). For x near 0, this is sqrt(100^2 + 1) ≈ 100, which is much larger than |x|, so the point is closer to O. For x near 100, the distance to O is 100, and the distance to B is sqrt(0 + 1) = 1, so the point is closer to B. The bisector between O and B is 100x + 1*y = (100^2 + 1)/2. At y = 0, x = (100^2 + 1)/200 ≈ (10000 + 1)/200 ≈ 50.005. Therefore, for x < 50.005, the point (x, 0) is closer to O, and for x > 50.005, closer to B. The length of x where it is closer to O is 50.005, and the total length of the x-axis in the first quadrant is 100. Therefore, the probability along the x-axis is 50.005 / 100 ≈ 1/2, which matches the overall probability of 1/2. Similarly, this applies to other regions. Therefore, it seems that the probability is indeed always 1/2, regardless of k. This is surprising, but mathematically, it appears to be correct.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial intuition, but the mathematics shows that for any rectangle, the region where points are closer to the center than to any vertex has area half of the rectangle. This is because the region is defined by the intersection of four half-planes, and due to the symmetry, it ends up being exactly half the area.\n\nHowever, let's verify this with the square case. For a square, the region is a diamond with area 2, and the square has area 4, giving probability 1/2. This is correct. For a very elongated rectangle, as shown, the probability is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability is always 1/2, regardless of k.\n\nBut the problem states \"a point is randomly chosen from the interior of rectangle ABCD. What is the probability that it is closer to O than to any of the four vertices?\" According to this, the answer is 1/2, but this seems too simple, and the problem provides a ratio k = AB/AD, which suggests that the answer might depend on k. This indicates that there must be a mistake in the derivation.\n\nWait, let's go back to the trapezoid area calculation. For the first quadrant, the area is (ab)/2, and total area is 2ab, giving probability 1/2. But where does this come from? Let me re-derive it.\n\nThe trapezoid in the first quadrant has bases L1 = (a² + b²)/(2a) and L2 = (a² - b²)/(2a), and height b. The area is (L1 + L2)/2 * b = [ ( (a² + b²) + (a² - b²) ) / (4a) ] * b = [ (2a²)/4a ] * b = (a/2) * b = (ab)/2. Yes, correct. Therefore, total area is 4 * (ab)/2 = 2ab, and since the area of the rectangle is 4ab, the probability is 2ab / 4ab = 1/2.\n\nThis suggests that the probability is always 1/2, regardless of the rectangle's aspect ratio. This is a surprising result, but mathematically it checks out in the examples. Therefore, the answer is 1/2, or 1/2, which is 0.5, so the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut why does the problem provide the ratio k = AB/AD? It seems like it's a red herring, or perhaps there is a mistake in the reasoning. Let me check with another example.\n\nTake a rectangle with a = 1, b = 1 (square). The probability is 1/2, which is correct.\n\nTake a rectangle with a = 1, b = 0.5 (k = 2). The area of the region is 2ab = 2*1*0.5 = 1. The area of the rectangle is 4*1*0.5 = 2. Probability is 1/2, correct.\n\nTake a rectangle with a = 1, b = 2 (k = 0.5). The area of the region is 2ab = 2*1*2 = 4. The area of the rectangle is 4*1*2 = 8. Probability is 4/8 = 1/2, correct.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the probability is always 1/2, regardless of k. This is a surprising result, but it seems to be mathematically consistent.\n\nHowever, this contradicts my initial intuition, but the derivation shows that due to the symmetry and the way the regions are defined, the area is always half of the rectangle. This is likely the correct answer, and the problem's mention of k is to lead the solver through the derivation, but the final probability is independent of k.\n\nBut let me verify with a different approach. Consider that for any point in the rectangle, either it is closer to O than to all vertices, or it is closer to at least one vertex. Due to the symmetry, for every point closer to a vertex, there is a corresponding point closer to the opposite vertex, and the regions might balance out. However, this is too hand-wavy.\n\nAnother approach: the set of points closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of four regions: closer to O than to A, B, C, D. Each of these regions is a half-plane. The intersection of these four half-planes is a convex region. Due to the symmetry, the area of this region is half of the rectangle. This might be a known result, but I am not aware of it.\n\nGiven the consistent results in examples and the derivation, I must conclude that the probability is 1/2, regardless of k.\n\nBut the problem asks for the probability in terms of k. This suggests that either the answer is indeed 1/2, or there is a mistake in the derivation.\n\nWait, let me think about the definition of the region. The region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of four regions: closer to O than to A, closer to O than to B, closer to O than to C, and closer to O than to D. Due to the symmetry, the area of this intersection is half the area of the rectangle. This is because for every point closer to O than to all vertices, there is a symmetric point on the other side, and the regions might complement each other. However, this is not a rigorous proof, but the calculations for specific cases support it.\n\nGiven the calculations for specific cases and the general derivation leading to 1/2, I will conclude that the probability is 1/2, or 1/2, and the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}\n</think>"}
