The question is asking how many rotatable bonds are in the molecule with the canonical SMILES 'CC(=O)CCCO'. The options are A:3, B:6, C:12, D:9. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I should probably draw the structure of the molecule based on the SMILES. Let me break down the SMILES string. The SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let's parse it step by step. \n\nStarting from the left, the first carbon is connected to another carbon (C-), then there's a branch. The branch is (C=O), which would be a carbonyl group (a double bond between carbon and oxygen). So the structure is something like CH2-C(=O)- followed by CCCO. Wait, maybe I should write the full structure.\n\nBreaking down the SMILES:\n\n- The first carbon (C) is connected to another carbon (C). So the first part is CH3-? Wait, the first two Cs might form a CH2 group if there's a branch. Wait, maybe I need to reconstruct the actual molecule.\n\nLet me try again. The SMILES 'CC(=O)CCCO' can be interpreted as follows:\n\nThe molecule starts with a carbon (C) connected to another carbon (C). The second carbon has a branch: (C=O). So the second carbon is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O). Then after that branch, there are two more carbons (CC) and then an oxygen (O). So the full structure would be:\n\nCH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-OH? Wait, no. Wait, the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let's see:\n\nThe first carbon is connected to the next carbon (so maybe CH3-?), then the second carbon (the one after the first) has a double bond to oxygen (C=O). Then after that, there are three carbons and an oxygen? Wait, the SMILES is C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O. So the structure would be:\n\nCH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-OH? Wait, but the last part is CO. So the oxygen is connected to a carbon? Wait, the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. So after the carbonyl group, there are three carbons and an oxygen. Let me count the atoms:\n\nThe SMILES is:\n\n1. C\n2. C(=O)\n3. C\n4. C\n5. C\n6. O\n\nSo the structure is: C1 connected to C2, which is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O). Then C2 is connected to C3, which is connected to C4, which is connected to C5, which is connected to O. Wait, but how are the bonds arranged?\n\nWait, the SMILES is written as: C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O. So the main chain is C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O. So the molecule is something like propanal but extended. Let me try to write the structure properly.\n\nFirst carbon (C1) is connected to the second carbon (C2). C2 has a double bond to oxygen (so a ketone if it's connected to two other carbons, or an aldehyde if connected to one carbon). In this case, C2 is connected to C1 and then to C3 (since after the (C=O) branch, there's another C). So C2 is connected to C1, C3, and the carbonyl oxygen. Therefore, C2 is a ketone group (since it's connected to two carbons and has a double bond to oxygen). So the structure is:\n\nCH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-OH? Wait, no. Wait, the last part is CO. So the O is at the end. Wait, the SMILES is C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O. So the last carbon (C5) is connected to the oxygen. So the O is a single bond to the last carbon. So the molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-O? But that doesn't make sense because the O at the end would need to have a hydrogen or another bond. Wait, maybe it's an ether? Or maybe the O is part of an alcohol? Wait, the SMILES is written as 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let me check again.\n\nThe SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let's parse it as:\n\n- The first carbon (C1) is connected to the second carbon (C2).\n- C2 has a double bond to oxygen (so C2=O).\n- Then, C2 is connected to the third carbon (C3).\n- C3 is connected to C4.\n- C4 is connected to C5.\n- C5 is connected to O.\n\nSo the full structure would be:\n\nCH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-O? But O is at the end. Wait, but O is a terminal atom here. Unless there's a hydrogen attached. So maybe it's an alcohol? But the SMILES doesn't show a hydrogen. Wait, in SMILES notation, terminal oxygens without explicit hydrogens are usually part of an ether or hydroxyl group. But in this case, since it's written as 'O' at the end, maybe it's a hydroxyl group. So the molecule would be:\n\nCH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, but the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let me count the atoms again.\n\nThe SMILES has 5 carbons and one oxygen. Wait, the SMILES is:\n\nC (1), C (2), (C=O) (branch on C2?), then C (3), C (4), C (5), O (6). Wait, maybe the structure is:\n\nC1 connected to C2, which has a double bond to O and is connected to C3. Then C3 connected to C4, C4 connected to C5, and C5 connected to O. So the full molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-O? But again, the O is at the end. Unless the O is connected to another carbon, but there's no more carbons. Wait, maybe it's a terminal hydroxyl group. So the molecule is 3-oxopentanol? Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES is written as:\n\nC-C(=O)-C-C-C-O. Let me think of the actual molecule. The SMILES 'CC(=O)CCCO' can be converted to a structure. Let me try to write the IUPAC name to make it clearer.\n\nStarting from the left, the first carbon is CH3. Then, the next carbon (C2) is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), making it a ketone. Then, after that, there are three more carbons and an oxygen. So the main chain is five carbons long? Let's see: C1 (CH3)-C2(=O)-C3-C4-C5-O. So the main chain would be C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-O. Wait, but the O is attached to C5. So the molecule is 2-oxopentyl alcohol? Or maybe it's an ester? No, because there's no O connected to a carbonyl.\n\nWait, maybe the correct structure is pentane-2-one with a hydroxymethyl group? No, the SMILES is CC(=O)CCCO. Let me try to count the bonds again. The molecule has five carbons and one oxygen. The SMILES is:\n\nC-C(=O)-C-C-C-O. So the structure is:\n\nCH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. But that would be pentane-2-one with a hydroxymethyl group? Wait, no. If the O is at the end of the chain, then it's a hydroxyl group on the fifth carbon. So the molecule would be 2-pentanone with a hydroxyl group on the fifth carbon. But the SMILES doesn't show the hydroxyl, but in SMILES, sometimes the hydroxyl is written as 'O' at the end. Wait, no, the hydroxyl would be written as 'OH' if there's an explicit hydrogen. But in the given SMILES, it's just 'O'. Hmm, maybe the O is part of an ether, but there's no other carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let's look at each part:\n\n- The first carbon is 'C', which is connected to the next 'C'.\n- The second carbon has a branch: (C=O). So that carbon is connected to a carbonyl group.\n- Then, after that, there are three more carbons (CCC) and an oxygen (O). So the structure is:\n\nC1-C2(=O)-C3-C4-C5-O. So the O is attached to C5. But O is a terminal atom here. Unless there's a hydrogen, making it an alcohol. However, in SMILES notation, if there's a hydroxyl group, it's usually written as 'OH'. But in this case, the SMILES ends with 'O', which might indicate that the O is connected to a hydrogen. Wait, maybe the SMILES is missing some hydrogens, but in reality, the O would have a hydrogen. So the actual molecule is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. So the IUPAC name would be 2-oxopentan-5-ol? Or maybe pentane-2,5-diol? No, because only the fifth carbon has the hydroxyl.\n\nBut regardless of the name, the key is to figure out the rotatable bonds.\n\nNow, what is a rotatable bond? A rotatable bond is a single bond that is not part of a ring, not part of a double bond, and not restricted in rotation due to some other factor (like being adjacent to a double bond in a way that restricts rotation). Typically, single bonds between saturated carbon atoms are rotatable.\n\nSo, to count the rotatable bonds, I need to look at all single bonds in the molecule that are not in rings, not in double bonds, and not adjacent to double bonds in a way that restricts rotation.\n\nFirst, let's draw the structure properly. Let me try again:\n\nThe molecule is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, but the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let me check the number of atoms. The SMILES has 5 carbons and 1 oxygen. Wait, the SMILES is:\n\nC (1), C (2), (C=O) (branch on C2?), then C (3), C (4), C (5), O (6). Wait, that's 5 carbons and 1 oxygen. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1 connected to Carbon 2, which is connected to a carbonyl (C=O). Then Carbon 2 connected to Carbon 3. Carbon 3 connected to Carbon 4, Carbon 4 connected to Carbon 5, and Carbon 5 connected to Oxygen. So the structure is:\n\nCH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. So Carbon 1 is CH3, Carbon 2 is CH (since it's connected to O, C1, and C3), Carbon 3 is CH2, Carbon 4 is CH2, Carbon 5 is CH2-OH.\n\nWait, but Carbon 2 is connected to three groups: C1, C3, and the carbonyl oxygen. So Carbon 2 is a CH group. Then Carbon 3 is connected to Carbon 2 and Carbon 4. So Carbon 3 is CH2. Carbon 4 is CH2, Carbon 5 is CH2-OH.\n\nSo the molecule is:\n\nCH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. That's 3-oxopentanol? Or pentane-2,5-diol? No, only the hydroxyl on carbon 5. So it's 2-oxopentan-5-ol.\n\nNow, to count the rotatable bonds. Let's look at each single bond and see if it's rotatable.\n\nFirst, the bond between Carbon 1 and Carbon 2: C1-C2. Carbon 1 is CH3, Carbon 2 is CH (connected to O and C3). This is a single bond between two saturated carbons. Is this bond rotatable? Yes, unless restricted. But Carbon 2 is connected to a carbonyl group. However, the rotation around the C1-C2 bond is not restricted by the carbonyl group. The carbonyl is on Carbon 2, but the bond to Carbon 1 is a single bond. So this bond is rotatable.\n\nNext, the bond between Carbon 2 and Carbon 3: C2-C3. Carbon 2 is CH connected to O (double bond), C1, and C3. Carbon 3 is CH2. This bond is between a CH and CH2. However, Carbon 2 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Does this affect the rotatability? The bond between Carbon 2 and Carbon 3 is a single bond. However, if the bond is adjacent to a double bond, sometimes the rotation is restricted. Wait, but the double bond is on Carbon 2. The bond between C2 and C3 is a single bond. However, the presence of a carbonyl group on Carbon 2 might restrict rotation around the C2-C3 bond? Or not? Typically, the presence of a carbonyl group on Carbon 2 does not restrict rotation around the single bond between C2 and C3. The restriction would be if there was a double bond adjacent to the single bond, but in this case, the double bond is on the same carbon. So the bond between C2 and C3 is a single bond between a CH and CH2. Since Carbon 2 is connected to a double bond, but the bond in question is a single bond. Rotational freedom here is not restricted. Therefore, this bond is rotatable.\n\nWait, but sometimes, when a single bond is adjacent to a double bond, it's considered non-rotatable. Wait, but here the single bond is adjacent to a double bond. Wait, Carbon 2 has a double bond (C=O) and a single bond to Carbon 3. So the bond between C2 and C3 is adjacent to the double bond. In such cases, sometimes the rotation is restricted because of the adjacent double bond. Wait, but in reality, the double bond is on Carbon 2, which is connected to the O. The bond between C2 and C3 is a single bond. The presence of the double bond on Carbon 2 doesn't directly restrict rotation around the C2-C3 bond. However, sometimes, when a single bond is adjacent to a double bond (i.e., in a structure like R1-C(=O)-R2), the single bond between C and R2 is considered non-rotatable because the double bond's electron density might influence the rotation. But I'm not sure. According to some definitions, a rotatable bond is a single bond not in a ring, not adjacent to a double bond, and not part of a ring. Wait, no, the exact definition is a single bond not in a ring, not part of a double bond, and not part of a ring. Wait, perhaps the key is whether the bond is adjacent to a double bond. If the single bond is adjacent to a double bond, then it's considered non-rotatable? Or is that only in certain cases?\n\nLet me recall. In computational chemistry, the number of rotatable bonds is often calculated by counting the number of single bonds not in a ring and not adjacent to a double bond. Wait, but adjacent to a double bond can be ambiguous. For example, in a structure like CH2-C(=O)-CH2, the single bond between the carbonyl carbon and the next CH2 is considered a rotatable bond. Because the double bond is on the same carbon, but the single bond is between the carbonyl carbon and another CH2. In such cases, the bond is rotatable. However, if the single bond is between two carbons, one of which is part of a double bond (like in CH2-CH2-CH2, where one CH2 is part of a double bond), then the bond adjacent to the double bond may be considered non-rotatable. But in our case, the bond between C2 and C3 is between a carbon with a double bond (C=O) and a CH2. So, according to some definitions, this bond is considered rotatable. For example, in the case of a ketone, the single bond adjacent to the carbonyl is considered rotatable. Therefore, the bond between C2 and C3 is rotatable.\n\nNext, the bond between Carbon 3 and Carbon 4: C3-C4. Both are CH2 groups connected by a single bond. This is clearly rotatable.\n\nThe bond between Carbon 4 and Carbon 5: C4-C5. Both are CH2 groups connected by a single bond. Rotatable.\n\nThe bond between Carbon 5 and Oxygen: C5-O. This is a single bond between a carbon and an oxygen. However, rotatable bonds are typically considered between two carbon atoms. Wait, but sometimes, bonds involving heteroatoms (like C-O) can be considered rotatable. For example, in the case of an ether (R-O-R), the bond between O and R is not considered rotatable because the oxygen has lone pairs and the rotation is restricted. However, in the case of a hydroxyl group (R-OH), the bond between C and O is considered rotatable? Or not? There's some debate here. According to some sources, a rotatable bond is a single bond between two non-hydrogen atoms where at least one of the atoms is a carbon. So, the C-O bond in a hydroxyl group is a single bond between C and O. However, the rotation around this bond is considered restricted because of the lone pairs on oxygen. Therefore, in many computational methods, the C-O bond in a hydroxyl group is not counted as a rotatable bond. However, in other cases, like in an ether (R-O-R'), the C-O-C bond is considered non-rotatable. But the C-O bond in a hydroxyl group (R-OH) is a single bond between C and O. So, is this considered rotatable? \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's check the standard definitions. According to the RDKit definition, a rotatable bond is a single bond not in a ring, not adjacent to a double bond, and not part of a ring. Additionally, bonds to heteroatoms (like O) are considered rotatable only if both sides of the bond are connected to carbon. Wait, no. The standard definition from the RDKit (a cheminformatics library) is that a rotatable bond is a single bond not in a ring, not adjacent to a double bond, and not part of a ring. So, for example, in a hydroxyl group (R-OH), the bond between R and O is a single bond between C and O. Since one of the atoms is not a carbon, this bond is not considered rotatable. Therefore, the C-O bond in a hydroxyl group is not counted as a rotatable bond. \n\nTherefore, in our molecule, the bond between Carbon 5 and Oxygen is not a rotatable bond.\n\nSo, let's tally up the rotatable bonds:\n\n1. C1-C2: Yes\n2. C2-C3: Yes\n3. C3-C4: Yes\n4. C4-C5: Yes\n5. C5-O: No\n\nSo that's four rotatable bonds? Wait, but the options given are A:3, B:6, C:12, D:9. So four isn't one of the options. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of single bonds. Let me re-examine the structure.\n\nThe molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Let's list all the single bonds:\n\n1. C1-C2 (CH3-CH)\n2. C2-C3 (CH-CH2)\n3. C3-C4 (CH2-CH2)\n4. C4-C5 (CH2-CH2)\n5. C5-O (CH2-OH)\n\nSo that's five single bonds. Now, which of these are rotatable?\n\nAccording to the definition, a rotatable bond is a single bond not in a ring, not adjacent to a double bond, and not part of a ring. \n\nBond 1: C1-C2. This is a single bond between two carbons. Is it adjacent to a double bond? The double bond is on Carbon 2 (C=O). The bond between C1 and C2 is adjacent to the double bond (C=O) on Carbon 2. Wait, is that considered adjacent? If a single bond is adjacent to a double bond, then it's not considered rotatable. So in this case, Bond 1 (C1-C2) is adjacent to the double bond on Carbon 2. Therefore, it might not be considered rotatable. \n\nWait, this is a key point. If a single bond is adjacent to a double bond, then it's not considered rotatable. So, in this case, the bond between C1 and C2 is adjacent to the double bond on C2. Therefore, it's not a rotatable bond. Similarly, Bond 2 (C2-C3) is adjacent to the double bond on C2. Wait, the double bond is on C2. So, the bond between C2 and C3 is adjacent to the double bond. Therefore, it's not rotatable. \n\nWait, this changes everything. So my previous assumption was wrong. The bonds adjacent to the double bond are not rotatable. \n\nSo let's re-analyze:\n\nBond 1: C1-C2. Adjacent to a double bond (C=O on C2). Not rotatable.\n\nBond 2: C2-C3. Adjacent to the double bond (C=O on C2). Not rotatable.\n\nBond 3: C3-C4. Not adjacent to any double bond. Rotatable.\n\nBond 4: C4-C5. Not adjacent to any double bond. Rotatable.\n\nBond 5: C5-O. Not a C-C bond. Not rotatable.\n\nSo that gives us two rotatable bonds. But the options are A:3, B:6, C:12, D:9. Two isn't an option. Hmm. So where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the adjacency to a double bond. Let me check again. The double bond is on Carbon 2 (C=O). The bonds adjacent to the double bond would be the bonds that are connected to the double-bonded carbon. So, for the C=O group on Carbon 2, the bonds adjacent to the double bond would be the bonds connected to Carbon 2. Carbon 2 is connected to three groups: C1, C3, and the double bond to O. So the bonds C1-C2 and C2-C3 are adjacent to the double bond. Therefore, those bonds are considered adjacent to a double bond and thus not rotatable. So only bonds C3-C4 and C4-C5 are rotatable. That's two bonds. But the options don't have two. So clearly, I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the molecule isn't as I thought. Let me double-check the SMILES. The SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let me try to parse it again. \n\nThe SMILES is written as:\n\nC (1) connected to C (2), which has a double bond to O and is connected to C (3). Then, C (3) is connected to C (4), which is connected to C (5), which is connected to O. So the structure is:\n\nC1-C2(=O)-C3-C4-C5-O. \n\nWait, but Carbon 5 is connected to O. So the O is a terminal group. So the molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. \n\nWait, but perhaps there's another bond that I'm missing. Let me count the number of single bonds again. \n\nIn the structure:\n\n- C1 is CH3 connected to C2 (single bond)\n- C2 is CH connected to O (double bond), C1, and C3 (single bond)\n- C3 is CH2 connected to C2 and C4 (single bond)\n- C4 is CH2 connected to C3 and C5 (single bond)\n- C5 is CH2 connected to C4 and O (single bond)\n- O is connected to C5 (single bond)\n\nSo the single bonds are:\n\n1. C1-C2\n2. C2-C3\n3. C3-C4\n4. C4-C5\n5. C5-O\n\nNow, according to the definition, bonds adjacent to a double bond are not rotatable. The double bond is on C2 (C=O). The bonds adjacent to this double bond are the bonds connected to C2, which are C1-C2 and C2-C3. So these two bonds are not rotatable. The remaining bonds are C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-O. Of these, C3-C4 and C4-C5 are single bonds between carbons and are not adjacent to any double bonds. The C5-O bond is between carbon and oxygen. \n\nSo, if we consider only C-C single bonds not adjacent to double bonds, then we have two rotatable bonds: C3-C4 and C4-C5. But the options don't include 2. So perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has more rotatable bonds. Let me think again. Perhaps I missed some bonds. Let me consider all possible single bonds in the molecule.\n\nWait, the molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Let me draw this out:\n\nCH3-CH(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. So the main chain is five carbons long, with a ketone on the second carbon and a hydroxyl on the fifth carbon.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the bond between C1 and C2 is a single bond between two carbons. If it's not adjacent to a double bond, then it would be rotatable. But earlier, I thought that because C2 has a double bond, the bond between C1-C2 is adjacent to the double bond. But maybe the adjacency is only considered if the double bond is on the other carbon. For example, if you have a structure like R1-C(=O)-R2, then the bond between R1 and C is adjacent to the double bond, and the bond between C and R2 is also adjacent. So in that case, both bonds are adjacent to the double bond and thus non-rotatable. \n\nSo in our case, the bond between C1 and C2 is adjacent to the double bond on C2, and the bond between C2 and C3 is also adjacent to the double bond on C2. Therefore, both bonds are not rotatable. So only the bonds after C3 are rotatable. \n\nBut that gives us two rotatable bonds (C3-C4 and C4-C5). But the options don't have 2. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the number of single bonds. Let me check again. The molecule is:\n\nCH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH.\n\nSo the single bonds are:\n\n1. Between CH3 and CH(=O): C1-C2\n2. Between CH(=O) and CH2: C2-C3\n3. Between first CH2 and second CH2: C3-C4\n4. Between second CH2 and third CH2: C4-C5\n5. Between third CH2 and OH: C5-O\n\nSo five single bonds. Of these, bonds 1 and 2 are adjacent to the double bond (C=O), so not rotatable. Bonds 3 and 4 are between CH2 groups, so rotatable. Bond 5 is C-O, not rotatable. So total of 2 rotatable bonds. But the options are A:3, B:6, C:12, D:9. None of these options include 2. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the SMILES or the structure.\n\nLet me try to draw the molecule again from the SMILES. The SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let me use a SMILES parser or try to think of it differently.\n\nThe SMILES is written as follows:\n\n- The first carbon is connected to the second carbon.\n- The second carbon has a double bond to oxygen.\n- The second carbon is also connected to the third carbon.\n- The third carbon is connected to the fourth carbon.\n- The fourth carbon is connected to the fifth carbon.\n- The fifth carbon is connected to oxygen.\n\nSo the molecule is: C1-C2(=O)-C3-C4-C5-O.\n\nWait, but how many carbons are there? Let's count:\n\n- C1, C2, C3, C4, C5: five carbons.\n- One oxygen from the double bond, and one oxygen at the end: two oxygens? No, the SMILES has only one oxygen at the end. The double bond is to oxygen, so the molecule has two oxygens: one in the carbonyl group and one at the end. But the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO', which has one 'O' at the end. Wait, but the double bond to oxygen is part of the SMILES as (C=O). So the total number of oxygens is two: one in the ketone and one in the hydroxyl group. But the SMILES as written only shows one oxygen at the end. Wait, no. The SMILES is written as CC(=O)CCCO. The (C=O) is part of the SMILES, and the final 'O' is another oxygen. So the molecule has two oxygens: one in the ketone and one at the end. But in the structure I drew, there are two oxygens. So the molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. \n\nBut if that's the case, then there are two oxygens. But the SMILES as written is CC(=O)CCCO. Let me count the number of atoms in the SMILES:\n\n- C, C, (C=O), C, C, C, O. So total of 5 carbons and 2 oxygens. Yes. So the molecule has two oxygens: one in the carbonyl and one at the end.\n\nBut the problem is that according to this structure, there are only two rotatable bonds, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps my initial interpretation of the SMILES is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the SMILES is different. Let me try to parse it again. The SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let me think about the branching. The (C=O) is a branch on the second carbon. So the structure is:\n\nC1-C2(=O)-C3-C4-C5-O. So the main chain is five carbons, with the second carbon having a carbonyl group and the fifth carbon having an oxygen. But perhaps there's another interpretation of the SMILES. For example, maybe the 'CC(=O)CCCO' is structured differently.\n\nWait, maybe the SMILES is written as C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O, but the last part is CO, which could be a carbonyl group? No, because it's written as 'CO' without an equals sign. So it's a single bond between C and O. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a ring involved? But the SMILES doesn't show any ring closures. \n\nWait, let's think about another possibility. Maybe the molecule is not linear. For example, the SMILES could be interpreted as:\n\nC connected to C(=O), which is connected to C, C, and C-O. But that might not make sense. Let me try to write it out. The SMILES is CC(=O)CCCO. The (C=O) is a branch on the second carbon. So the second carbon is connected to C1, the carbonyl oxygen, and C3. Then C3 is connected to C4 and C5? Wait, no. The SMILES after the (C=O) is CCCO. So after the branch, the main chain continues with three carbons and an oxygen. So the full structure is:\n\nC1-C2(=O)-C3-C4-C5-O.\n\nSo five carbons and one oxygen. Wait, but earlier I thought there were two oxygens. No, the SMILES has one oxygen in the carbonyl (C=O) and one at the end. So two oxygens. But the SMILES is written as CC(=O)CCCO, which includes the carbonyl oxygen as part of the (C=O) and the final O as a terminal oxygen. \n\nBut regardless, the number of rotatable bonds is still two, which isn't an option. So I must be missing something. Let me think about other possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the molecule has more single bonds that I'm not considering. For example, the hydroxyl group (OH) on the fifth carbon has a bond between O and H, but that's a single bond and not between two carbons, so it's not counted. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule has more branches or rings? The SMILES doesn't indicate any rings. \n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the SMILES is not as I interpreted. Let me try to draw it using a SMILES parser. Since I can't do that right now, let me think of another way. \n\nThe SMILES 'CC(=O)CCCO' can be broken down into fragments. Let's see:\n\n- The first part is 'CC(=O)', which is a carbon connected to a carbon with a double bond to oxygen. So that's a ketone group attached to a methyl group: CH3-C(=O)-.\n\n- Then, the rest is 'CCCO', which is three carbons and an oxygen. So the full structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. \n\nBut in this case, there are only two rotatable bonds. But the options don't have 2. Let me check if there are other single bonds that I'm missing. \n\nWait, perhaps the bond between the carbonyl carbon (C2) and the oxygen is a double bond, but that's not a single bond, so it's not counted. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing that the molecule has more single bonds. For example, the hydroxyl group's oxygen has bonds to other atoms, but those are not between carbons. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the definition of rotatable bonds includes some bonds adjacent to double bonds. For example, in some cases, even if a bond is adjacent to a double bond, it's still considered rotatable. Let me check the standard definition.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia page on rotatable bonds: \"A rotatable bond is a single bond in a molecule that is not part of a ring and not adjacent to a double bond.\" So, if a single bond is adjacent to a double bond, it's not considered rotatable. \n\nIn our case, the bonds adjacent to the double bond (C=O) are C1-C2 and C2-C3. These are not rotatable. The remaining single bonds are C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-O. Of these, only C3-C4 and C4-C5 are between carbons. The C5-O bond is not between two carbons, so it's not counted. So total of 2 rotatable bonds. \n\nSince the options don't have 2, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the SMILES. Let me try to think of another possible structure for the SMILES 'CC(=O)CCCO'. \n\nWait, perhaps the SMILES is written as C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O, but the last part is a different group. For example, maybe the 'CCCO' is part of an ester? But an ester would have a structure like R-C(=O)-O-R'. In this case, the SMILES would be CC(=O)OCCC, but our SMILES is CC(=O)CCCO. \n\nWait, maybe the 'O' at the end is part of an ether? For example, the structure could be CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CH3, but the SMILES would have to show the other carbon. Since the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO', it ends with O, implying a terminal oxygen. \n\nWait, let me count the number of bonds again. Maybe there are more single bonds. Let me think of the molecule as having five carbons and one oxygen, with a ketone group and a hydroxyl group. \n\nStructure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH.\n\nSingle bonds:\n\n1. C1-C2 (single)\n2. C2-C3 (single)\n3. C3-C4 (single)\n4. C4-C5 (single)\n5. C5-O (single)\n\nOf these, bonds 1 and 2 are adjacent to the double bond (C=O), so not rotatable. Bonds 3 and 4 are rotatable. Bond 5 is not between carbons, so not counted. Total of 2. \n\nBut the options are A:3, B:6, C:12, D:9. So none of these. This suggests that either the question is incorrect, or my interpretation is wrong. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule is not what I think it is. Let me try to think of another way to parse the SMILES. \n\nThe SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let's consider that the (C=O) is a branch on the second carbon, but perhaps the rest of the SMILES is structured differently. \n\nFor example, the SMILES could be: C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O, where the three carbons after the (C=O) are connected in a different way. But I don't see how that would change the number of rotatable bonds. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a different branching. Let me try to parse the SMILES again. The SMILES is written as:\n\nC (1) connected to C (2), which has a branch: (C=O). Then, after the branch, the SMILES continues with CCCO. So the main chain after the branch is three carbons and an oxygen. So the full structure is C1-C2(=O)-C3-C4-C5-O. \n\nWait, perhaps the bond between C2 and C3 is a single bond, and the bond between C2 and the oxygen is a double bond. So, the structure is as before. \n\nAnother possibility: maybe the molecule has more single bonds that I'm not considering. For example, each carbon has multiple bonds to other atoms. But in a saturated molecule, each carbon has four bonds. Let me check the degrees of each carbon in the structure.\n\nCarbon 1 (CH3): connected to C2 (single bond) and three hydrogens. So four bonds.\n\nCarbon 2 (CH): connected to C1 (single), C3 (single), and double bond to O. Total of four bonds.\n\nCarbon 3 (CH2): connected to C2 (single), C4 (single), and two hydrogens.\n\nCarbon 4 (CH2): connected to C3 (single), C5 (single), and two hydrogens.\n\nCarbon 5 (CH2): connected to C4 (single), O (single), and two hydrogens.\n\nOxygen (OH): connected to C5 (single) and one hydrogen.\n\nYes, all atoms have correct valence. \n\nSo the only single bonds are the ones I listed. \n\nBut since the answer isn't among the options, perhaps the question is about a different molecule. Let me check if I made a mistake in the SMILES parsing. \n\nWait, the canonical SMILES for the molecule I described (CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH) would be different. Let me try to generate it. \n\nThe correct canonical SMILES for 2-oxopentan-5-ol might not be 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let me think. \n\nThe molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. To generate the canonical SMILES, we need to consider the order of atoms. \n\nThe correct canonical SMILES might be 'CC(=O)CCCO' if the hydroxyl group is on the end. But perhaps there's another way to write it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is 3-oxopentanal, which would have a different structure. But the SMILES would be different. \n\nWait, let's try to think of another possibility. What if the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO' representing a different structure. For example, maybe the 'CCCO' part is a branch. But the SMILES is written as CC(=O)CCCO, which implies that after the (C=O) branch, the main chain continues with CCCO. \n\nAnother possibility: the SMILES might represent a different connectivity. For example, maybe the structure is C-C(=O)-C(C)-CO, but that would require a different SMILES. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written as C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O, with the O being part of a different group. But I don't see how that would add more rotatable bonds. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule has more rotatable bonds if we consider that some bonds adjacent to the double bond are still rotatable. For example, in some definitions, only the bond directly part of the double bond is non-rotatable, and adjacent bonds are allowed. But according to the standard definition, bonds adjacent to a double bond are not considered rotatable. \n\nLet me check an example. Take acetone (propan-2-one), which has the structure CH3-C(=O)-CH3. The single bonds in acetone are the two C-C bonds between the central carbon and the methyl groups. Are these bonds rotatable? According to the definition, they are adjacent to a double bond and thus not rotatable. In reality, acetone has no rotatable bonds because the two methyl groups are symmetrically attached to the carbonyl carbon, and there are no single bonds that are not adjacent to the double bond. So acetone has zero rotatable bonds. \n\nIf that's the case, then in our molecule, the bonds adjacent to the double bond (C1-C2 and C2-C3) are not rotatable. The remaining bonds are C3-C4 and C4-C5, giving two rotatable bonds. But the options don't have 2. \n\nThis suggests that either the question is incorrect, or I'm misinterpreting the SMILES. \n\nWait, let me try to think of the molecule as having more single bonds. Perhaps the SMILES is not as I thought. Let me try to draw it using a different approach. \n\nThe SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. Let's parse it step by step using SMILES rules. \n\n- Start with C (carbon 1)\n- Next is C (carbon 2)\n- Then (C=O) is a branch on carbon 2. So carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1, a double bond to oxygen, and a single bond to carbon 3.\n- Then the main chain continues with C (carbon 3), C (carbon 4), C (carbon 5), and O (oxygen).\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: connected to carbon 2 (single bond)\nCarbon 2: connected to carbon 1 (single), carbon 3 (single), and double bond to oxygen\nCarbon 3: connected to carbon 2 (single), carbon 4 (single)\nCarbon 4: connected to carbon 3 (single), carbon 5 (single)\nCarbon 5: connected to carbon 4 (single), oxygen (single)\nOxygen: connected to carbon 5 (single)\n\nSo the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. \n\nNow, let's count the rotatable bonds again. \n\n- C1-C2: adjacent to double bond → not rotatable\n- C2-C3: adjacent to double bond → not rotatable\n- C3-C4: between two CH2 groups → rotatable\n- C4-C5: between two CH2 groups → rotatable\n- C5-O: between carbon and oxygen → not rotatable\n\nTotal of 2 rotatable bonds. \n\nSince the options don't include 2, I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the question is referring to a different molecule, or there's a misunderstanding in the definition. \n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the definition of rotatable bonds includes the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the oxygen? No, that's a double bond, not a single bond. \n\nWait, what if the molecule is not what I think it is. Let me try to think of the SMILES 'CC(=O)CCCO' as representing a different structure. \n\nFor example, if the SMILES is written as C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O, but the 'CCCO' part is a branch. But the SMILES doesn't show a branch there. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written as C-C(=O)-C-C-C-O, with the O being a carbonyl group. But that would require a double bond, which is not indicated. \n\nWait, let me try to think of the SMILES as representing a molecule with more rotatable bonds. For example, if the molecule has more single bonds not adjacent to double bonds. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule is not linear. For example, if there's a branch that I'm not considering. Let me try to parse the SMILES again. \n\nThe SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO'. The (C=O) is a branch on the second carbon. The rest of the SMILES is CCCO, which is three carbons and an oxygen. So the main chain after the branch is three carbons and an oxygen. \n\nWait, perhaps the structure is: \n\nCarbon 1: CH3\nCarbon 2: CH(=O)\nCarbon 3: CH2\nCarbon 4: CH2\nCarbon 5: CH2\nOxygen: OH\n\nBut that's what I had before. \n\nWait, maybe the bond between the carbonyl carbon (C2) and the oxygen is a single bond, making it an alcohol? No, because it's written as (C=O), which is a double bond. \n\nWait, if the bond were single, it would be written as CO, not C=O. So it's definitely a double bond. \n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the molecule has more single bonds because of hydrogen atoms. But no, hydrogen atoms don't contribute to rotatable bonds. \n\nWait, maybe the question is about the number of single bonds, not rotatable bonds. But the question specifically asks for rotatable bonds. \n\nGiven that the options don't include 2, but the correct answer based on the structure I derived is 2, I must conclude that either the question has an error, or I'm missing something. \n\nWait, let me check if the bond between C2 and C3 is actually not adjacent to the double bond. The double bond is on C2, and the bond between C2 and C3 is a single bond. Is this bond considered adjacent to the double bond? In the definition, adjacent means directly connected to the double bond. Since the double bond is on C2, and the bond between C2 and C3 is connected to C2, it is adjacent. Therefore, it's not rotatable. \n\nBut what if the double bond is on a different carbon? For example, if the double bond were on C3, then the bond between C2-C3 would be adjacent. But in our case, the double bond is on C2. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look up the number of rotatable bonds for a similar molecule. For example, if we have a molecule like pentane-2-one (acetone extended), how many rotatable bonds does it have?\n\nPentane-2-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The structure is similar to our molecule, but with a methyl group at the end instead of a hydroxyl. \n\nIn this case, the rotatable bonds would be:\n\n- C3-C4 (between the two CH2 groups)\n- C4-C5 (between CH2 and CH3)\n\nSo two rotatable bonds. \n\nIf our molecule is similar, with a hydroxyl group at the end instead of a methyl, it would still have two rotatable bonds. \n\nBut the options don't have 2. This suggests that the correct answer is not listed, or there's a mistake in the question. \n\nHowever, since the options are given, and the user expects one of them, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me try to think of another possibility. \n\nWait, perhaps the SMILES is 'CC(=O)CCCO' representing a different molecule, such as a cyclic structure. But the SMILES doesn't show any ring closures. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has more single bonds that I'm not considering. For example, if the hydroxyl group is part of an ether or another group that adds more single bonds. \n\nWait, if the molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH3, but the SMILES would be longer. \n\nGiven the SMILES provided, I can't see how it would have more than two rotatable bonds. \n\nPerhaps the question is referring to the total number of single bonds, not rotatable ones. Let's count the single bonds: 5 single bonds. But the options are up to 12, so that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number of bonds that can rotate, including those adjacent to double bonds. But according to the standard definition, those are not counted. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is A:3, and try to see why. \n\nIf there are three rotatable bonds, where could they be? Let's assume that one of the bonds adjacent to the double bond is considered rotatable. For example, if the bond between C1-C2 is considered rotatable. Then, we would have:\n\n- C1-C2: rotatable (1)\n- C3-C4: rotatable (2)\n- C4-C5: rotatable (3)\n\nTotal of 3. This would give option A:3. \n\nBut why would the bond between C1-C2 be considered rotatable? If the definition excludes only bonds directly part of a double bond, and not those adjacent. But standard definitions say adjacent bonds are not rotatable. \n\nHowever, some sources might have different criteria. For example, some might consider that only the bond itself is restricted, not the adjacent ones. But in the case of a ketone, the single bond adjacent to the carbonyl is not restricted. Wait, in reality, the rotation around the C1-C2 bond in our molecule is not restricted by the carbonyl group. The rotation would be possible, even though it's adjacent to the double bond. \n\nWait, this is a crucial point. In reality, the rotation around the single bond adjacent to a double bond is possible, but it's sometimes considered restricted due to the adjacent double bond's influence. However, in computational chemistry, the standard definition is that a single bond adjacent to a double bond is not considered rotatable. But in reality, it might still rotate, and some definitions might include it. \n\nIf the question is using a different definition, where only the double bond itself is excluded, and adjacent single bonds are included, then the number of rotatable bonds would be 3: C1-C2, C3-C4, and C4-C5. \n\nIn that case, the answer would be A:3. \n\nGiven that the options include A:3, and this is the closest to what I derived, I think the intended answer is A:3, assuming that the bond between C1-C2 is considered rotatable despite being adjacent to the double bond. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A:3.\n</think>"}
