They form an ideal solution, which probably means I can use Raoult's Law here. Let me recall what Raoult's Law says. If I remember correctly, it states that the partial vapor pressure of each component in the mixture is proportional to its mole fraction and its vapor pressure when pure. So the total vapor pressure would be the sum of the partial pressures of each component.\n\nAlright, the problem gives me the vapor pressures of pure A and pure B. Solvent A has a vapor pressure of 345 torr, and solvent B has 213 torr at room temperature. The mole fraction of A in the mixture is 0.285. Since there are only two components, the mole fraction of B should be 1 minus the mole fraction of A. Let me check that. So mole fraction of B would be 1 - 0.285 = 0.715. That makes sense.\n\nNow, applying Raoult's Law for each component. The partial pressure of A would be the mole fraction of A multiplied by the vapor pressure of pure A. Similarly for B. Then add them together for the total vapor pressure.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nPartial pressure of A (P_A) = X_A * P_A°\nPartial pressure of B (P_B) = X_B * P_B°\nTotal vapor pressure (P_total) = P_A + P_B\n\nGiven:\nX_A = 0.285\nP_A° = 345 torr\nX_B = 0.715\nP_B° = 213 torr\n\nCalculating P_A first:\n0.285 * 345 torr. Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.285 times 345. Let me break it down. 0.2 * 345 = 69, 0.08 * 345 = 27.6, 0.005 * 345 = 1.725. Adding them together: 69 + 27.6 = 96.6 + 1.725 = 98.325 torr. So approximately 98.325 torr for P_A.\n\nNow P_B: 0.715 * 213 torr. Let me calculate that. Maybe breaking down 0.7 * 213 and 0.015 * 213. \n\n0.7 * 213 = 149.1\n0.015 * 213 = 3.195\nAdding them together: 149.1 + 3.195 = 152.295 torr.\n\nSo total vapor pressure is 98.325 + 152.295. Let me add those numbers. 98 + 152 is 250, and 0.325 + 0.295 is 0.62. So total is approximately 250.62 torr. Rounding to the nearest whole number, that would be about 251 torr. Looking at the options given, option D is 251 torr. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors. \n\nFirst, X_A is 0.285, so 0.285 * 345. Let me do it another way. 345 * 0.285. Let me convert 0.285 to a fraction. 0.285 is 285/1000, which simplifies to 57/200. So 345 * 57 / 200. Let me compute 345 * 57 first. \n\nWell, 345 * 50 = 17,250\n345 * 7 = 2,415\nTotal is 17,250 + 2,415 = 19,665. Then divide by 200: 19,665 / 200 = 98.325. So that's correct. So P_A is indeed 98.325 torr.\n\nFor P_B: 0.715 * 213. Let me verify. 213 * 0.7 = 149.1. 213 * 0.015 = 3.195. Total 149.1 + 3.195 = 152.295. Correct. Then total pressure is 98.325 + 152.295 = 250.62 torr. So approximately 251 torr. The options given are A:213, B:345, C:568, D:251. So D is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was applying Raoult's Law correctly and calculating the partial pressures. The mole fractions add up to 1, and the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures. The answer seems to be D:251 torr.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
