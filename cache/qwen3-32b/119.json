The internal energy U is given for one mole of gas as:\n\nU = (N_A/2)ħω₀ + (N_A ħω₀)/(exp(βħω₀) - 1)\n\nFirst, I remember that the molar specific heat capacity at constant volume, c_vib, is the derivative of the internal energy with respect to temperature, divided by the number of moles. Since this is already per mole (because N_A is Avogadro's number), taking the derivative of U with respect to T should give me the specific heat capacity directly, right?\n\nSo, c_vib = (dU/dT). Let me confirm that. Yes, for molar specific heat, since U is given per mole, differentiating with respect to T would give the molar specific heat capacity.\n\nNow, let me write down the given U again:\n\nU = (N_A ħ ω₀)/2 + (N_A ħ ω₀)/(exp(β ħ ω₀) - 1)\n\nWhere β is 1/(k_B T), right? Because in statistical mechanics, β is often defined as inverse temperature in units of energy, so β = 1/(k_B T). Let me check that. Yes, β is typically 1/(k_B T), so βħω₀ would be ħω₀/(k_B T). So, β is 1/(k_B T).\n\nTherefore, to find dU/dT, I need to differentiate both terms with respect to T. Let me note that the first term is (N_A ħ ω₀)/2, which is a constant with respect to temperature. Therefore, its derivative is zero. So, only the second term contributes to the specific heat.\n\nSo, focusing on the second term:\n\nU_second = (N_A ħ ω₀)/(exp(β ħ ω₀) - 1)\n\nLet me denote x = β ħ ω₀ = (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T). So, x is inversely proportional to T. Therefore, when taking the derivative with respect to T, I need to use the chain rule.\n\nLet me write U_second as:\n\nU_second = N_A ħ ω₀ * [exp(x) - 1]^{-1}\n\nBut x = (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T), so dx/dT = - (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T²) = -x/(T). Wait, let me compute dx/dT properly.\n\nx = (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T)\n\nTherefore, dx/dT = - (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T²) = -x * (1/T). Because x = (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T) implies that x * T = (ħ ω₀)/k_B, so dx/dT = -x / T.\n\nSo, to compute dU_second/dT, I need to differentiate [exp(x) - 1]^{-1} with respect to T. Using the chain rule:\n\nd/dT [exp(x) - 1]^{-1} = - [exp(x) - 1]^{-2} * exp(x) * dx/dT\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\ndU_second/dT = N_A ħ ω₀ * [ - exp(x) / (exp(x) - 1)^2 ] * dx/dT\n\nSubstituting dx/dT:\n\ndx/dT = - (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T²) = -x / T\n\nTherefore:\n\ndU_second/dT = N_A ħ ω₀ * [ - exp(x) / (exp(x) - 1)^2 ] * (-x / T )\n\nSimplify the negatives:\n\n= N_A ħ ω₀ * [ exp(x) / (exp(x) - 1)^2 ] * (x / T )\n\nNow, let me write x in terms of T again. Remember x = (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T). Also, note that the term x / T is equal to (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T²). But maybe there's a better way to express this. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we want to write the specific heat capacity c_vib, which is dU/dT, and since U_second is the only term contributing, then:\n\nc_vib = [N_A ħ ω₀ * x * exp(x)] / [T (exp(x) - 1)^2 ]\n\nBut x is (ħ ω₀)/(k_B T). Let me substitute that back in.\n\nBut also, note that T is in the denominator here. Let me see if I can express this in terms of k_B and T. Let me write:\n\nFirst, let me note that x = ħ ω₀ / (k_B T). Therefore, x / T = ħ ω₀ / (k_B T²). Also, the term 1/T is present. Wait, but in the expression above, we have:\n\nc_vib = N_A * [ ħ ω₀ * x * exp(x) ] / [ T (exp(x) - 1)^2 ]\n\nBut x is ħ ω₀/(k_B T), so substituting:\n\nc_vib = N_A * [ ħ ω₀ * (ħ ω₀ / (k_B T)) * exp(ħ ω₀/(k_B T)) ] / [ T (exp(ħ ω₀/(k_B T)) - 1)^2 ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: N_A * [ (ħ ω₀)^2 / (k_B T) ) * exp(x) ]\n\nDenominator: T [exp(x) - 1]^2\n\nTherefore, overall:\n\nc_vib = N_A * (ħ ω₀)^2 / (k_B) * [ exp(x) / (T^2 (exp(x) - 1)^2) ) ]\n\nBut T^2 is in the denominator, and since x is proportional to 1/T, perhaps we can write this in terms of x again. Alternatively, maybe there's a more standard form for this expression. Let me recall the Einstein model for specific heat.\n\nIn the Einstein model, the specific heat for vibrational modes is given by:\n\nC_v = 3Nk [ (ħ ω / (2k_B T)) * (ħ ω / (k_B T)) / sinh²(ħ ω/(2k_B T)) ) ]\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, the standard formula for the specific heat capacity in the Einstein model is:\n\nC_v = 3Nk_B ( (θ_E / T)^2 (e^{θ_E / T}) / (e^{θ_E / T} - 1)^2 )\n\nWhere θ_E is the Einstein temperature, defined as ħ ω / k_B. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for a single oscillator, the specific heat is:\n\nC = k_B (x^2 e^x)/(e^x - 1)^2 ), where x = ħ ω / (k_B T). Therefore, if we have N oscillators, then C = N k_B (x^2 e^x)/(e^x - 1)^2 )\n\nBut in our case, since we are dealing with molar specific heat, N would be N_A, and k_B N_A is R, the gas constant. Therefore, perhaps our expression is:\n\nc_vib = R (x^2 e^x)/(e^x - 1)^2 ), where x = ħ ω₀ / (k_B T). Let me check my derivation again.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nc_vib = N_A * (ħ ω₀)^2 / (k_B) * [ exp(x) / (T^2 (exp(x) - 1)^2) ) ]\n\nBut since x = ħ ω₀ / (k_B T), then ħ ω₀ = x k_B T. Therefore, (ħ ω₀)^2 = x² k_B² T². Let me substitute that:\n\nc_vib = N_A * (x² k_B² T²) / k_B * [ exp(x) / (T² (exp(x) - 1)^2) ) ] =\n\nSimplify:\n\nN_A * x² k_B T² * exp(x) / [ T² (exp(x) - 1)^2 ) ] =\n\nThe T² cancels:\n\nN_A x² k_B exp(x) / (exp(x) - 1)^2 )\n\nBut N_A k_B is R, the gas constant. Therefore:\n\nc_vib = R * [x² exp(x)] / [ (exp(x) - 1)^2 ]\n\nBut x = ħ ω₀ / (k_B T). Therefore, the molar specific heat capacity is:\n\nc_vib = R * [ (ħ ω₀ / (k_B T))² exp(ħ ω₀ / (k_B T)) ] / [exp(ħ ω₀ / (k_B T)) - 1]^2\n\nAlternatively, if we define the Einstein temperature θ_E = ħ ω₀ / k_B, then x = θ_E / T, so:\n\nc_vib = R * (θ_E / T)^2 * exp(θ_E / T) / [exp(θ_E / T) - 1]^2\n\nWhich matches the standard Einstein model formula for the molar specific heat capacity. Therefore, my derivation seems correct.\n\nSo, the expression for c_vib is R times [x² e^x / (e^x - 1)^2], where x is ħω₀/(k_B T).\n\nNow, the problem also asks to determine its limits at high and low temperatures. Let me consider those.\n\nFirst, high temperature limit: T → ∞, so x = ħ ω₀/(k_B T) → 0.\n\nWe can expand the exponential functions in Taylor series for small x.\n\nFirst, let me note that for small x, e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + ...\n\nTherefore, e^x - 1 ≈ x + x²/2 + ...\n\nTherefore, the denominator [e^x - 1]^2 ≈ x² + x³ + ...\n\nThe numerator is x² e^x ≈ x² (1 + x + x²/2 + ...)\n\nTherefore, the entire fraction becomes:\n\n[x² (1 + x + ...)] / [x² + x³ + ...] ≈ [1 + x + ...]/[1 + x + ...] ≈ 1 as x → 0.\n\nTherefore, c_vib ≈ R * 1 = R.\n\nBut wait, let me check with more precise expansion.\n\nLet me compute the limit as x → 0 of [x² e^x]/[e^x - 1]^2.\n\nLet me write e^x - 1 ≈ x + x²/2 + x³/6 + ..., so squared is x² + x³ + (x^4)/3 + ...\n\nThe numerator is x² e^x ≈ x² (1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + ...)\n\nSo, dividing numerator and denominator:\n\n[ x² + x³ + (x^4)/2 + ... ] / [ x² + x³ + (x^4)/3 + ... ] = [1 + x + (x²)/2 + ...] / [1 + x + (x²)/3 + ...]\n\nUsing division of series, for small x:\n\nApproximately, 1 + x + (x²)/2 divided by 1 + x + (x²)/3. Let me write as:\n\n[1 + x + (x²)/2] / [1 + x + (x²)/3] ≈ [1 + x + (x²)/2] * [1 - x - (x²)/3 + ...] using 1/(1 + ε) ≈ 1 - ε + ...\n\nMultiplying out:\n\n1*(1 - x - x²/3) + x*(1 - x - x²/3) + (x²/2)*(1 - x - x²/3) + ...\n\n= 1 - x - x²/3 + x - x² - x³/3 + x²/2 - ... \n\nNow, collect terms:\n\nConstant term: 1\n\nx terms: -x + x = 0\n\nx² terms: -x²/3 - x² + x²/2 = (-1/3 -1 + 1/2)x² = (-1/3 - 3/3 + 3/6)x² = (-4/3 + 1/2)x² = (-8/6 + 3/6)x² = (-5/6)x²\n\nSo up to x², the ratio is approximately 1 - (5/6)x². Therefore, as x approaches 0, the limit is 1. Therefore, the leading term is 1. Therefore, c_vib approaches R * 1 = R.\n\nBut wait, in the high temperature limit, what is the expected specific heat? For vibrational modes, in classical statistical mechanics, each vibrational mode contributes k_B per degree of freedom. However, a harmonic oscillator has two degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energy), so per oscillator, the specific heat would be k_B. But since we have one mole, and assuming one vibrational mode per molecule, then the molar specific heat would be R. Therefore, this matches. Therefore, the high temperature limit is c_vib → R. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the low temperature limit, T → 0, so x = ħ ω₀/(k_B T) → ∞. So we need to evaluate the limit of [x² e^x]/[e^x - 1]^2 as x → ∞.\n\nNote that for large x, e^x - 1 ≈ e^x, so the denominator is approximately [e^x]^2 = e^{2x}. The numerator is x² e^x. Therefore, the ratio is x² e^x / e^{2x} = x² e^{-x} → 0 as x → ∞. Therefore, c_vib approaches zero.\n\nThis also makes sense physically. At low temperatures, the thermal energy k_B T is much smaller than the energy spacing ħ ω₀, so the vibrational modes are frozen out, and the specific heat goes to zero. This is in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nThe molar specific heat capacity is c_vib = R * [x² e^x / (e^x - 1)^2], where x = ħ ω₀/(k_B T). At high temperatures (T → ∞), c_vib approaches R, and at low temperatures (T → 0), c_vib approaches 0.\n\nBut let me check if there is a more precise way to write the expression. Since the problem says \"derive the expression\", so I need to present it properly.\n\nStarting from the given U:\n\nU = (N_A/2)ħω₀ + (N_A ħ ω₀)/(exp(β ħ ω₀) - 1)\n\nThen c_vib = dU/dT.\n\nAs we saw, derivative of the first term is zero. The second term's derivative led us to:\n\nc_vib = R * [x² e^x / (e^x - 1)^2], where x = ħ ω₀/(k_B T)\n\nAlternatively, we can write this in terms of β. Since β = 1/(k_B T), then x = β ħ ω₀. Therefore, x = β ħ ω₀. But since β = 1/(k_B T), maybe another way to write it.\n\nAlternatively, since x = θ_E / T where θ_E is the Einstein temperature, but perhaps the problem expects the answer expressed in terms of the given variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want it expressed in terms of ω₀, T, etc., without introducing θ_E.\n\nSo, writing the expression:\n\nc_vib = R * [ (ħ ω₀ / (k_B T))² e^{ħ ω₀ / (k_B T)} ] / [ e^{ħ ω₀ / (k_B T)} - 1 ]²\n\nAlternatively, since R = N_A k_B, we can write:\n\nc_vib = N_A k_B [ (ħ ω₀ / (k_B T))² e^{ħ ω₀ / (k_B T)} ] / [ e^{ħ ω₀ / (k_B T)} - 1 ]²\n\nSimplify:\n\nc_vib = N_A [ (ħ ω₀)^2 / (k_B T^2) ) * e^{ħ ω₀/(k_B T)} / (e^{ħ ω₀/(k_B T)} - 1)^2 ) ]\n\nBut perhaps the first expression with R is more concise.\n\nTherefore, the derived expression is c_vib = R [x² e^x / (e^x - 1)^2] with x = ħ ω₀/(k_B T). And the limits are high T → R, low T → 0.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to write this expression. Alternatively, using hyperbolic functions? For example, sinh(x/2) or something. Let me recall that:\n\n[e^x - 1]^2 = e^{2x} - 2 e^x + 1\n\nBut maybe not helpful here. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as:\n\n[x² e^x]/[e^x - 1]^2 = [x²]/[e^x - 1]^2 * e^x = [x²]/[ (e^{x/2} - e^{-x/2})^2 * e^x ] * e^x ?\n\nWait, e^x - 1 = e^{x/2}(e^{x/2} - e^{-x/2}) = 2 e^{x/2} sinh(x/2). Therefore, [e^x - 1]^2 = 4 e^x sinh²(x/2). Therefore:\n\n[x² e^x]/[e^x - 1]^2 = [x² e^x]/[4 e^x sinh²(x/2)] = x² / [4 sinh²(x/2)].\n\nTherefore, c_vib can also be written as R * x² / [4 sinh²(x/2)].\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't require this form. The original derivation gives the expression in terms of exponentials, so unless specified, the first form is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nc_vib = R [ (ħ ω₀ / (k_B T))² e^{ħ ω₀/(k_B T)} ] / [ e^{ħ ω₀/(k_B T)} - 1 ]²\n\nOr using x as defined.\n\nAnd the limits are:\n\nAs T → ∞, c_vib → R.\n\nAs T → 0, c_vib → 0.\n\nTherefore, the vibrational specific heat approaches the classical equipartition value at high temperatures and goes to zero at low temperatures, consistent with quantum effects freezing out the vibrational modes.\n\nLet me recap the steps to ensure no mistakes were made:\n\n1. Start with U given as a function of T through β.\n\n2. Recognize that c_vib is dU/dT.\n\n3. Differentiate the second term of U with respect to T, using chain rule and substitution of x = β ħ ω₀.\n\n4. Simplify the derivative, recognizing that N_A k_B is R.\n\n5. Analyze the high and low temperature limits by expanding exponentials or considering their asymptotic behavior.\n\nAll steps seem consistent. The differentiation was carefully done with substitution of x, and the limits make physical sense.\n\nTherefore, the derived expression and limits are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe molar specific heat capacity is $ c_{\\text{vib}} = R \\left( \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T} \\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\hbar \\omega_0/(k_B T)}}{\\left( e^{\\hbar \\omega_0/(k_B T)} - 1 \\right)^2} $, with high-temperature limit $ R $ and low-temperature limit $ 0 $.
