I need to figure out which of the given options has the correct chemical formula. Let me go through each one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: White phosphorus is P2. Hmm, I remember that phosphorus can exist in different allotropic forms. The common ones are white, red, and black phosphorus. For white phosphorus, I think the molecules are P4, not P2. So maybe A is incorrect. Let me confirm. Yeah, I think white phosphorus is P4 molecules, so A is wrong.\n\nOption B: 2-Methylbutane is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Let me draw the structure. 2-Methylbutane. Butane has four carbons. Adding a methyl group on the second carbon. Wait, butane is CH3CH2CH2CH3. If we add a methyl group on carbon 2, that would make it CH2(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me count again. The parent chain is butane (4 carbons). The methyl group is on carbon 2. So the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that's 2-methylbutane. But wait, butane is four carbons. If you add a methyl group on the second carbon, the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that's five carbons? No, the parent chain is butane, which is four. Adding a methyl group makes it a five-carbon molecule? Wait, no, because the parent chain is the longest chain. Wait, if you have 2-methylbutane, the longest chain is butane (four carbons) with a methyl branch on carbon 2. Let me think. The structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's four carbons in the main chain, with a methyl on the second carbon. So the formula would be (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? Let me check. The first carbon is CH3, the second carbon has a CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH3. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the formula given is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Let's break it down: (CH3)2CH- is the isopropyl group, then CH2CH3. So combining them: (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Let me count the carbons. The isopropyl group is (CH3)2CH-, which is three carbons. Then CH2CH3 is two more, making total of five? Wait, but butane is four. Wait, maybe the parent chain here is pentane? But the name is 2-methylbutane. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Because if you have a methyl group on butane, the total number of carbons would be five. So the correct IUPAC name should be 2-methylbutane, but actually, the longest chain might be pentane if there's a longer chain possible. Wait, but maybe in this case, the longest chain is indeed four carbons. Let me think again. If you have a structure where there's a four-carbon chain with a methyl on the second carbon, then the correct name is 2-methylbutane. However, sometimes the numbering might change. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is different. Wait, maybe the formula given is actually 2-methylbutane. Let me check another way. The formula (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: (CH3)2CH is three carbons (two methyl groups attached to a central carbon), then CH2CH3 is two more. So total of five carbons? Wait, but that would be pentane. If there's a methyl branch, maybe the structure is 2-methylpropane? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall that 2-methylbutane is actually 2-methylbutane, which is a five-carbon molecule with a methyl branch on the second carbon. Wait, no, butane is four carbons. Adding a methyl group would make it five. But the correct IUPAC name would be 2-methylbutane? Or is it pentane with a different numbering? Wait, maybe the correct name is 3-methylpentane? No. Let me think of the structure. If the main chain is four carbons, then the methyl is on the second. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Which is 2-methylbutane. The formula would be C5H12. Let me check the formula given. The formula (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Let's count the Hs. The first part is (CH3)2CH which is (CH3)2CH. Each CH3 has 3 Hs, so two CH3 groups contribute 2*3=6 Hs. Then the CH has one H. Then the next part is CH2CH3. The CH2 has 2 Hs, and the CH3 has 3 Hs. So total Hs: 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 12 Hs. The carbons: (CH3)2CH is 2 CH3 groups (2 carbons) plus the central carbon (total 3 carbons), then CH2CH3 is two more (total 5 carbons). So C5H12. Which is correct for pentane isomer. So the name 2-methylbutane is correct? Because the main chain is four carbons, with a methyl on the second. So the formula given is correct. So maybe B is correct? Wait, but I thought earlier that maybe there's a longer chain. Let me check. If the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, is there a longer chain? Let me see. If you take the central carbon with the methyl group, maybe another way to number? Let's try. If you start from the other end, it's still 2-methylbutane. Because the methyl is on the second carbon. So the name is correct. Therefore, option B is correct? Hmm. Maybe I was wrong earlier. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: Blue vitriol is FeSO4·7H2O. Blue vitriol is copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, which is CuSO4·5H2O. Wait, but FeSO4·7H2O is ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, which is green vitriol, not blue. So blue vitriol is copper sulfate, so C is incorrect. Therefore, option C is wrong.\n\nOption D: Stearic acid is C15H31COOH. Stearic acid is a saturated fatty acid with 18 carbons. The formula would be CH3(CH2)16COOH. Let me count. The carboxylic acid group is COOH, and the rest is the alkyl chain. So for stearic acid, 18 carbons total. The formula would be C17H35COOH? Wait, no. Let me think. The general formula for a saturated fatty acid is CnH2nO2. For stearic acid, n is 18. So the formula is C18H36O2. But written as R-COOH. So R would be C17H35-. Therefore, the formula would be C17H35COOH. But the option D is C15H31COOH. That would be C16H32O2? Wait, let me check. If the R group is C15H31-, then the total formula would be C15H31COOH, which is C16H33COO? Wait, no. Let me count properly. The R group is C15H31-, then adding COOH gives C15H31-COOH. So total carbons: 15 + 1 (from COOH) + 1 (from COOH?) Wait, no. The COOH group is -COOH, which is one carbon. So total carbons would be 15 (from R) + 1 (from COOH) = 16. The formula would be C16H32O2? Because for a saturated chain, the formula of the entire molecule would be C16H32O2? Wait, but stearic acid is C18H36O2. So if option D is C15H31COOH, that's C16H32O2, which would be palmitic acid? Because palmitic acid is C16H32O2. So D is incorrect. Therefore, option D is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct options are B and D? Wait, no, D is incorrect. So only B is correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, option D: Stearic acid is C15H31COOH. If that's the case, then the formula is C16H32O2. But stearic acid is C18H36O2. So D is incorrect. So only B is correct? But let me check again for B. The formula given is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Which is 2-methylbutane. Let me check the IUPAC name. The structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me write it properly. The formula is (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH3. So the structure is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH3-CH-C-CH2-CH3\n\nWait, no. Let me write it step by step. The formula is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Breaking it down:\n\nThe first part is (CH3)2CH which is CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. (CH3)2CH is CH2CH(CH3)? No. Wait, (CH3)2CH is the isopropyl group: CH(CH3)2? No, (CH3)2CH is CH2CH(CH3)? Wait, no. Let me think. The group (CH3)2CH is CH(CH3)2? No, (CH3)2CH is CH2CH(CH3)? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me write the structure properly. The formula is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Let me count the carbons in each part. The first part, (CH3)2CH, is two methyl groups attached to a central carbon, which is connected to the next part. So:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH3-C-CH2-CH3\n        |\n       H ?\n\nWait, no. The formula is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Let's parse it as:\n\nThe molecule is (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH3. So the first carbon is connected to two CH3 groups and a CH2CH3? No. Let me think of it as a chain. Let me write out all the bonds:\n\nStarting from the left: (CH3)2CH is a branch. So the main chain would be CH2-CH2-CH3? No. Maybe I should draw it as:\n\nThe central carbon has two CH3 groups attached (so that's the isopropyl group), then connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH3. So the structure is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2-CH-C-CH2-CH3 ?\n\nNo, perhaps I need to think of it as:\n\nThe molecule is (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH3. So the structure is:\n\nCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 ?\n\nYes, that's correct. So the central carbon (the second carbon in the main chain) has a methyl group. So the main chain is four carbons, with a methyl on the second carbon. So the IUPAC name is 2-methylbutane. Therefore, the formula given in option B is correct. So B is correct.\n\nSo among the options, only B is correct. Let me check again.\n\nA: White phosphorus is P4, so A is wrong.\n\nB: Correct.\n\nC: Blue vitriol is CuSO4·5H2O, so C is wrong.\n\nD: Stearic acid is C17H35COOH, so D is wrong (it's C15H31COOH which would be palmitic acid, C16H32O2). Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe correct option is \\boxed{B}.\n</think>"}
