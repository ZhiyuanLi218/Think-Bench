It is given that the distance from Earth to the Sun is less than the distance from Mars to the Sun, i.e., Earth has a smaller orbital radius.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Orbital Period (Option A)**\n\nAccording to **Kepler’s Third Law**, the square of the orbital period $ T $ is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (orbital radius) $ r $:\n\n$$\nT^2 \\propto r^3\n$$\n\nSince Earth is closer to the Sun, its orbital radius is smaller, and hence its orbital period is **shorter** than that of Mars. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Orbital Velocity (Option B)**\n\nThe orbital velocity $ v $ of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,\n- $ M $ is the mass of the Sun,\n- $ r $ is the orbital radius.\n\nA smaller $ r $ (as in Earth's case) results in a **greater** orbital velocity. Thus, **Option B is incorrect** since it claims the opposite.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Orbital Acceleration (Option C)**\n\nThe centripetal acceleration $ a $ of a planet in circular motion is:\n\n$$\na = \\frac{v^2}{r} = \\frac{GM}{r^2}\n$$\n\nAgain, because Earth is closer to the Sun, its orbital acceleration is **greater** than that of Mars. Therefore, **Option C is also incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Orbital Angular Velocity (Option D)**\n\nThe angular velocity $ \\omega $ is related to the orbital period $ T $ by:\n\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}\n$$\n\nSince Earth has a **shorter orbital period**, its angular velocity is **greater** than that of Mars. Thus, **Option D is correct**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the options A to D is correct based on the given information that Earth and Mars are both in uniform circular motion around the Sun, and Earth is closer to the Sun than Mars. Let me recall what I know about orbital mechanics.\n\nFirst, I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period of a planet to its distance from the Sun. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since both Earth and Mars are in circular orbits, their semi-major axes are just their distances from the Sun. So if Earth is closer, its orbital period should be shorter than Mars's. That would mean option A says Earth's period is greater, which would be wrong. So A is incorrect.\n\nNext, orbital velocity. The formula for orbital velocity in a circular orbit is v = sqrt(GM/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Sun, and r is the orbital radius. Since Earth is closer (smaller r), the velocity should be higher. So Earth's orbital velocity is greater than Mars's. Therefore, option B says Earth's is less, which is incorrect. So B is wrong.\n\nOrbital acceleration. The centripetal acceleration for circular motion is a = v²/r or also can be written as GM/r². Since Earth is closer (smaller r), the acceleration should be greater. Therefore, Earth's acceleration is greater than Mars's. So option C says Earth's acceleration is less, which is wrong. C is incorrect.\n\nAngular velocity. Angular velocity ω is related to the period T by ω = 2π/T. Since Earth's period is shorter, its angular velocity should be higher. So option D says Earth's angular velocity is greater, which is correct. Therefore, D is the right answer.\n\nLet me double-check. Kepler's third law: T² ∝ r³. So if Earth's r is smaller, T is smaller. So shorter period means higher angular velocity because ω = 2π/T. Yes. And velocity v = sqrt(GM/r) so higher for smaller r. Acceleration a = GM/r², so higher for smaller r. All that makes sense. So D is correct. The answer should be D.\n</think>"}
