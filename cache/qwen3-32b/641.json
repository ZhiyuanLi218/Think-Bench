Heinrich Hertz experimentally confirmed this by generating and detecting electromagnetic waves in 1887, which validated Maxwell’s predictions. This was a pivotal moment in physics.\n\n✅ **Correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option B:**\n> *Chadwick obtained recoil nucleus $_8^{17}\\mathrm{O}$ by bombarding $_7^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ with $\\alpha$ ions and discovered neutrons.*\n\n**Analysis:**  \nChadwick did discover the neutron in 1932 by bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. The emitted neutrons were detected by observing their interactions with paraffin wax (which contains hydrogen). The nitrogen bombardment described here is not associated with Chadwick’s experiment but rather with earlier work by Rutherford (which led to the discovery of the proton).\n\n❌ **Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option C:**\n> *Becquerel discovered the phenomenon of natural radioactivity, indicating that atomic nucleus has a complex structure.*\n\n**Analysis:**  \nHenri Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity in 1896 by observing that uranium salts could expose photographic plates without light. This discovery showed that atoms emit radiation spontaneously, which was a groundbreaking insight into the internal structure of the atom. While Becquerel did not explicitly discover the nucleus or its composition (protons and neutrons), his work laid the foundation for understanding that the atom has an internal structure. The phenomenon of radioactivity itself implies that the nucleus is not a simple, indivisible particle but rather capable of emitting particles like alpha and beta, which suggests a complex structure.\n\n✅ **Correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option D:**\n> *Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of atomic structure through research on cathode rays.*\n\n**Analysis:**  \nRutherford proposed the nuclear model of the atom in 1911 based on the **alpha particle scattering experiment**, not cathode rays. Cathode rays were studied by J.J. Thomson, who discovered the electron. Rutherford’s model introduced the idea of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom.\n\n❌ **Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe statements that are consistent with the facts of physics history are:\n\n- **(A)** Hertz verified Maxwell's electromagnetic theory.\n- **(C)** Becquerel's discovery of natural radioactivity indicated the nucleus has a complex structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A and C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which of these options are correct based on my understanding of physics history.\n\nStarting with option A: Hertz verified Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light through a series of experiments. I remember that Maxwell proposed the theory of electromagnetism, and it was Hertz who conducted experiments that demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves, which would support Maxwell's theory. So A seems correct.\n\nOption B: Chadwick obtained recoil nucleus 17O by bombarding 14N with α ions and discovered neutrons. Wait, I think Chadwick did discover the neutron, but I recall that he used beryllium, not nitrogen. The experiment where nitrogen was bombarded with alpha particles was done by Rutherford, which led to the first artificial nuclear transmutation. So B might be incorrect because the nucleus used here is different. Chadwick's experiment involved beryllium, so B is probably wrong.\n\nOption C: Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity, indicating the nucleus has a complex structure. Becquerel did discover radioactivity, right? But the fact that the nucleus has a complex structure was more realized after the discovery of protons and neutrons. Becquerel's discovery showed that atoms could emit radiation spontaneously, suggesting the nucleus isn't just a simple entity. So maybe C is correct? Or does it take the discovery of the nucleus's components to show complexity? Hmm, I think the discovery of radioactivity indicated that atoms are not indivisible and have internal structure, but the complex structure of the nucleus (like protons and neutrons) came later. So maybe C is correct because the phenomenon of radioactivity does suggest the nucleus isn't simple. But I need to confirm.\n\nOption D: Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of atomic structure through research on cathode rays. Wait, Rutherford's gold foil experiment involved alpha particles, not cathode rays. The nuclear model came from his alpha particle scattering experiments. Cathode rays are electrons, and the study of them was done by Thomson, who discovered the electron. So D is incorrect because Rutherford didn't use cathode rays for the nuclear model. Therefore, D is wrong.\n\nSo reviewing:\n\nA: Correct (Hertz confirmed Maxwell's EM waves)\n\nB: Incorrect (Chadwick used beryllium, not nitrogen)\n\nC: Becquerel discovered radioactivity, which indicated nucleus isn't simple. But does it directly indicate complex structure? Maybe. The fact that atoms can emit alpha and beta particles (which are helium nuclei and electrons) suggests that the nucleus has components. So C might be correct.\n\nD: Incorrect because Rutherford's nuclear model came from alpha scattering, not cathode rays.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C. But let me check each again.\n\nWait, the question says \"statements are consistent with the facts\" and we have to choose from A-D. The options are A, B, C, D. The answer is to select which ones are correct.\n\nBut the original problem is presented as a multiple-choice question where the user is to select the correct options. However, the way the question is written, in Chinese context, it might be a single choice or multiple. But the original instruction here is to answer with the correct options from A-D.\n\nBut the user says \"Options: (A)... (B)... (C)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" and the user wants me to pick which ones are correct.\n\nSo according to my analysis:\n\nA is correct (Hertz confirmed Maxwell's theory through experiments).\n\nB is incorrect because Chadwick discovered neutrons by bombarding beryllium with alpha particles, not nitrogen. The nitrogen bombardment was Rutherford's experiment leading to proton discovery?\n\nWait, let me check Chadwick's experiment again. Chadwick's experiment was to confirm the existence of neutrons. He bombarded beryllium with alpha particles, which emitted neutrons. These neutrons then collided with paraffin wax, causing protons to be ejected. By measuring the energy of the protons, he deduced the existence of neutral particles (neutrons). So the recoil nucleus in B is oxygen-17, but the target nucleus was nitrogen-14. That seems incorrect. So B is wrong.\n\nC: Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity. Yes, he discovered uranium salts emitting radiation. This showed that atoms have internal structure, leading to the understanding that the nucleus is complex. So C is correct.\n\nD: Rutherford's nuclear model came from alpha particle scattering experiments, not cathode rays. Cathode rays are electrons, and Rutherford didn't use them for the nuclear model. So D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C. However, in some cases, the options might be single choice, but here since it's multiple options, but the user hasn't specified. Wait, the original question is in Chinese, and the options are given as A to D. In Chinese exams, sometimes multiple choices are possible. However, the user hasn't specified whether it's multiple correct or single. But looking at the way the options are presented, it's possible that more than one is correct.\n\nBut let me check again each point:\n\nA: Hertz did verify Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. Maxwell's equations were theoretical, and Hertz's experiments (generating and detecting radio waves) confirmed the existence of electromagnetic waves as predicted. So A is correct.\n\nC: Becquerel's discovery of natural radioactivity indicated that the nucleus has a complex structure. Actually, the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel showed that atoms are not indivisible and that there is some internal activity. However, the realization that the nucleus has a complex structure (protons and neutrons) came later with the discovery of the proton and neutron. But the fact that Becquerel's discovery indicated that the nucleus is not a simple entity is acceptable. So C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and C. However, looking at the options, maybe only one is correct? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original question says \"statements are consistent with the facts. Options: (A)... (B)... (C)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So it's possible that more than one is correct. But in some cases, maybe only one is correct. Let me check each again.\n\nFor option B: Chadwick discovered neutrons by bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. The option says he bombarded nitrogen-14 with alpha ions and got oxygen-17 as recoil. That's not Chadwick's experiment. The nitrogen bombardment with alpha particles was done by Rutherford, which led to the proton's discovery. So B is incorrect.\n\nD: Rutherford's nuclear model was based on alpha scattering experiments, not cathode rays. Cathode rays are electrons, and the study of them was done by J.J. Thomson, who discovered the electron. Rutherford's model was from the gold foil experiment. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and C. However, in some textbooks, the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel is considered as showing that the atom is not indivisible, but the complex structure of the nucleus (i.e., protons and neutrons) was discovered later. However, the question says \"indicating that atomic nucleus has a complex structure\". If the nucleus is considered complex because it can emit alpha and beta particles, then maybe C is correct. But if the complex structure refers to protons and neutrons, then that came after the discovery of the neutron. So perhaps C is correct because the phenomenon of radioactivity (which Becquerel discovered) does indicate that the nucleus isn't simple. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nSo the correct options are A and C. But if the options are single choice, maybe there's a mistake. However, in Chinese multiple-choice questions, sometimes multiple options can be correct. The original question might expect multiple correct answers. But the way the user presented the question, they might want me to select all correct ones.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A and C. However, looking back, maybe the options are presented as single-select? Let me check the original options again.\n\nThe options are given as (A) ... (B) ... (C) ... (D) ... and the user says \"we should choose\", which in Chinese tests often implies multiple correct answers. However, sometimes it's single answer. But given the analysis, A and C are correct. However, let me check if there's any mistake.\n\nWait, Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light: Maxwell's theory predicted that light is an electromagnetic wave. Hertz's experiments confirmed the existence of electromagnetic waves, which validated Maxwell's theory. So A is correct.\n\nBecquerel's discovery of natural radioactivity: Yes, and this showed that atoms can emit radiation spontaneously, indicating that the nucleus is not a simple, indivisible particle. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nSo the correct options are A and C. However, in some cases, maybe only one is correct. But according to the analysis, both A and C are correct. But let me check if the options are presented as multiple correct. In Chinese exams, sometimes the options are labeled with letters, and you can have multiple correct answers. However, the way the user wrote the question, they might expect to select all correct ones. But since the user hasn't specified whether it's multiple correct or not, but in the original problem statement, the options are listed as A-D, and the answer is to choose from them. In Chinese tests, sometimes each question is single answer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, option C says \"Becquerel discovered the phenomenon of natural radioactivity, indicating that atomic nucleus has a complex structure.\" Is this correct? Becquerel discovered radioactivity, but the realization that the nucleus has a complex structure came later. Radioactivity showed that atoms have a nucleus and that it can emit particles, but the complex structure (protons and neutrons) was discovered after the neutron was found by Chadwick. So maybe the statement in C is not entirely accurate. The fact that the nucleus has a complex structure was more clearly shown after the discovery of protons and neutrons. Becquerel's discovery indicated that atoms are not indivisible and have internal structure, but not necessarily that the nucleus itself is complex. So maybe C is incorrect. If that's the case, then only A is correct.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let me think again.\n\nNatural radioactivity (Becquerel) showed that atoms can spontaneously emit alpha, beta, and gamma rays. This indicated that the atom has a nucleus (as per Rutherford's model) and that the nucleus can undergo changes. The fact that the nucleus can emit alpha particles (helium nuclei) suggests that the nucleus is made up of smaller particles. However, the discovery of protons and neutrons came later. So the statement that Becquerel's discovery \"indicates that atomic nucleus has a complex structure\" might be considered correct in the sense that it showed the nucleus isn't a simple, indivisible particle. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and C.\n\nBut in some textbooks, the credit for showing the nucleus has a complex structure might be given to later discoveries. However, the question says \"statements are consistent with the facts.\" So if the statement is that Becquerel's discovery indicated the nucleus has a complex structure, and given that radioactivity involves the nucleus emitting particles, it's reasonable to say that it indicates the nucleus isn't simple. So I think C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C. But let me check if the original question allows multiple answers. In Chinese exams, sometimes options are single answer, but sometimes multiple. Since the user hasn't specified, but in the original problem, the way it's written, it's possible that more than one is correct.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, maybe there's only one correct answer. For example, if the question is from a Chinese textbook, perhaps only one is considered correct. Let me check each again carefully.\n\nOption A: Hertz verified Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light. Maxwell's theory included that light is an electromagnetic wave. Hertz's experiments demonstrated electromagnetic waves, which confirmed Maxwell's theory. So this is correct.\n\nOption C: Becquerel's discovery of natural radioactivity indicated that the nucleus has a complex structure. Becquerel's work showed that atoms can emit radiation, which led to the understanding that the nucleus can change and emit particles, implying it's not a simple structure. So this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and C. However, in some cases, if the options are single-select, but the user allows multiple, then the answer would be A and C. But since the user is asking to select from A-D, and in Chinese tests sometimes multiple can be correct, I think the answer is A and C. However, I need to check if the options are presented as multiple correct or not.\n\nBut since the user hasn't specified, and given the analysis, I think A and C are correct. Therefore, the answer should be A and C.\n</think>"}
