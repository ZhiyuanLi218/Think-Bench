So, there's a particle with mass m, charge Q, and velocity V going into a uniform electric field E, and it travels a distance d. Now, they want to know how far it would travel if the original velocity is doubled and the mass is cut in half. The options are A:4d, B:2d, C:d, D:1/2d.\n\nHmm, first, I need to recall how electric fields affect charged particles. The electric force on a charge is F = Q*E. Since the particle is moving in an electric field, there should be an acceleration (or deceleration) depending on the direction of the field relative to the velocity. But the problem doesn't specify the direction of the electric field. Wait, maybe it's assuming the electric field is opposing the motion? Or maybe it's accelerating it? Hmm, the problem says the particle is directed toward the electric field. Wait, maybe the electric field is in a direction such that the force is opposite to the velocity? Or maybe the particle is moving into the field region, and the field is causing a force on it. Maybe the particle is slowing down? \n\nWait, the problem states that it \"travels a distance d.\" So maybe the electric field is causing a deceleration until the particle stops? Or maybe it's moving in a direction where the electric force is in the same direction as the velocity, causing it to speed up? But the problem says \"directed toward a uniform electric field.\" Hmm, maybe the electric field is in a direction that causes a force opposite to the velocity, so the particle decelerates and stops after traveling distance d. That seems like a common type of problem. For example, if a charged particle is fired into an electric field that opposes its motion, it will decelerate until it comes to rest. Then the distance it travels can be calculated using kinematic equations.\n\nLet me assume that the electric field is opposing the motion of the particle. So the force is F = -Q*E (assuming the field direction is opposite to the velocity). Then acceleration a = F/m = -Q*E/m.\n\nThen, using the kinematic equation: v^2 = u^2 + 2*a*s, where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity, a is acceleration, s is displacement. If the particle comes to rest, then final velocity v = 0. So 0 = u^2 + 2*a*s => s = -u^2/(2*a). Since acceleration a is negative (deceleration), substituting that in, the negatives cancel, so s = u^2/(2*(Q*E/m)) ) = (m*u^2)/(2*Q*E). So the distance d = (m*V^2)/(2*Q*E). \n\nSo if we double the velocity (V becomes 2V) and halve the mass (m becomes m/2), then the new distance d' would be:\n\nd' = ( (m/2)*(2V)^2 ) / (2*Q*E ) = ( (m/2)*4V^2 ) / (2*Q*E ) = (2*m*V^2) / (2*Q*E ) = (m*V^2)/(Q*E )\n\nComparing to original d = (m*V^2)/(2*Q*E ), so d' is twice that. So d' = 2d. Therefore, answer B:2d.\n\nWait, but let me check if my assumption about the direction of the field is correct. If the electric field is in the same direction as the velocity, then the particle would be accelerating, and the distance traveled would depend on how long it's in the field. But the problem says \"travels a distance d\". Maybe it's not about stopping but about something else? For example, maybe the electric field is perpendicular to the velocity, causing a deflection? But the question says the particle is directed toward the electric field. Hmm, maybe the electric field is in the direction of motion or opposite.\n\nBut if it's a uniform electric field, and the particle is moving in the field direction, then the force is constant. If the problem is about how far it travels before stopping, then my previous analysis applies. But if it's about the distance traveled during some time interval, then maybe different. However, since the problem doesn't mention time, but mentions distance d, and asks how the distance changes with velocity and mass, it's likely that the problem is about the stopping distance, or the distance over which the particle is brought to rest by the electric field. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the particle is moving in the electric field, which is causing an acceleration, and the distance is how far it goes in some time? But without time given, that seems less likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the particle is moving perpendicular to the electric field, like in a cathode ray tube, where the electric field causes a deflection. Then the distance traveled in the field might depend on the time it takes to go through the field, which would depend on the velocity. But the problem says \"directed toward a uniform electric field\", which is a bit unclear. \n\nBut given the answer choices, and the variables given (mass, charge, velocity, electric field strength, distance), the most straightforward scenario is probably the one where the electric field is causing a deceleration until the particle stops. \n\nLet me verify my equations again. Starting from kinematics:\n\nIf the particle has initial velocity V, and is decelerated by acceleration a until it stops, then:\n\nv² = u² + 2a s\n\n0 = V² + 2a d => d = -V²/(2a)\n\nSince a is negative (deceleration), let me write a = -F/m = - (Q E)/m. Therefore,\n\nd = -V²/(2*(-Q E/m)) ) = (m V²)/(2 Q E)\n\nYes, that's correct. So original d is proportional to m V².\n\nIf we double V to 2V, and halve m to m/2, then the new d' is:\n\nd' = ( (m/2) * (2V)^2 ) / (2 Q E ) = ( (m/2)*4V² ) / (2 Q E ) = (2 m V²) / (2 Q E ) = (m V²)/(Q E )\n\nOriginal d was (m V²)/(2 Q E ), so d' is 2d. Therefore, answer B.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about the distance traveled under the influence of the electric field for a certain time, but since time isn't mentioned, I think the stopping distance is the right approach.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the electric field is causing an acceleration, and the particle is moving in the direction of the field or opposite, but the distance d is given for some condition. However, without more information, the standard problem is the one where the particle is slowed down to rest, so I think my analysis is correct. Therefore, answer B: 2d.\n\nBut let me check another approach. Suppose the electric field is causing an acceleration, and the distance traveled is under constant acceleration. Suppose the particle is moving in the direction of the electric field, so acceleration is in the direction of motion. Then the distance traveled would depend on how long it's accelerating. But again, without time, maybe they are considering the same scenario where maybe the particle is moving in a region of length d, and we need to see how long it takes to traverse it? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the electric field is causing a force, and work done by the electric field is Q*E*d, which equals change in kinetic energy. So initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m V². If the work done by the electric field is Q E d, then:\n\nAssuming the electric field is doing work against the motion, so negative work:\n\n- Q E d = ΔKE = 0 - (1/2) m V² => d = (m V²)/(2 Q E ), same as before. So again, same result. Therefore, if velocity is doubled and mass is halved:\n\nd' = [ (m/2)*(2V)^2 ] / [2 Q E ] = [ (m/2)*4 V² ] / [ 2 Q E ] = [ 2 m V² ] / [ 2 Q E ] = [ m V² ] / [ Q E ] = 2d. So answer B. \n\nYes, this is consistent. So regardless of whether I think in terms of kinematics or work-energy, I get the same result. Therefore, the answer should be B: 2d.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
