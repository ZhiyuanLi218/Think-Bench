Let me start by writing down the unbalanced equation again to make sure I have it right:\n\nAl2(SO4)3·15H2O + Ca(HCO3)2 → Al(OH)3 + CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O\n\nHmm, okay. Let me first identify all the elements involved here. On the left side, we have aluminum (Al), sulfur (S), oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), calcium (Ca), and carbon (C). On the right side, we have aluminum hydroxide, calcium sulfate, carbon dioxide, and water. \n\nFirst, I should probably count the number of each atom on both sides. Let me start by listing them out.\n\nLeft side (reactants):\n- Al2(SO4)3·15H2O: This is aluminum sulfate with 15 water molecules. Let's break it down:\n  - Al: 2\n  - S: 3 (since there are 3 SO4 groups)\n  - O: (3*4) from sulfate + (15*1) from water. Wait, actually, each sulfate has 4 O, so 3*4=12, and each H2O has 1 O, so 15*1=15. Total O in sulfate and water? Wait, no, the formula is Al2(SO4)3·15H2O. So the sulfate is part of the main compound, and the 15H2O are separate. So O in sulfate: 3*4=12. O in water: 15*1=15. So total O from sulfate and water in the first compound? Wait, but the formula is Al2(SO4)3·15H2O. So the O in sulfate is 12, and the O in the 15H2O is 15. So total O from the first compound is 12 + 15 = 27? Wait, but maybe I should count each element separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to separate the formula. Let me think. The first compound is Al2(SO4)3·15H2O. So it's a hydrate. So the formula is Al2(SO4)3 with 15 H2O. So the elements in the first compound are:\n\n- Al: 2\n- S: 3\n- O: (from sulfate: 3*4=12) + (from water: 15*1=15) = 27 O? Wait, but each H2O has 1 O, so 15 H2O would have 15 O. So the total O in the first compound is 12 (from sulfate) + 15 (from water) = 27 O. Also, H in the first compound: from the water, 15 H2O gives 30 H. Also, the sulfate has no H. So H is 30.\n\nThen the second compound is Ca(HCO3)2. Let's break that down:\n\n- Ca: 1\n- H: 2 (from each HCO3^- group)\n- C: 2 (since there are 2 HCO3 groups)\n- O: 2*3=6 (each HCO3 has 3 O)\n\nSo total elements from the second compound:\n\n- Ca: 1\n- H: 2\n- C: 2\n- O: 6\n\nNow, adding all the elements from the left side:\n\nAl: 2\nS: 3\nO: 27 (from first compound) + 6 (from second compound) = 33\nH: 30 (from first compound) + 2 (from second compound) = 32\nCa: 1\nC: 2\n\nNow the right side:\n\nAl(OH)3: Al: 1, O: 3, H: 3 per molecule.\n\nCaSO4: Ca: 1, S: 1, O: 4 per molecule.\n\nCO2: C: 1, O: 2 per molecule.\n\nH2O: H: 2, O: 1 per molecule.\n\nLet me count the elements on the right side. Let's denote the coefficients as variables. Let me assign variables to each compound to balance them.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s say the coefficients are:\n\na Al2(SO4)3·15H2O + b Ca(HCO3)2 → c Al(OH)3 + d CaSO4 + e CO2 + f H2O\n\nWe need to find a, b, c, d, e, f such that the number of each element is equal on both sides.\n\nLet me set up equations for each element.\n\nAl: On left, 2a; on right, c. So 2a = c.\n\nS: On left, 3a; on right, d. So 3a = d.\n\nCa: On left, b; on right, d. So b = d. Wait, but from above, d = 3a. Therefore, b = 3a.\n\nC: On left, 2b; on right, e. So 2b = e. Since b = 3a, then e = 2*(3a) = 6a.\n\nH: On left, 30a (from 15H2O) + 2b (from Ca(HCO3)2) = total H on left. On right: 3c (from Al(OH)3) + 2f (from H2O). So:\n\n30a + 2b = 3c + 2f.\n\nBut since c = 2a (from Al), and b = 3a, let's substitute:\n\n30a + 2*(3a) = 3*(2a) + 2f → 30a + 6a = 6a + 2f → 36a = 6a + 2f → 30a = 2f → f = 15a.\n\nO: This is a bit more complex. Let's count O on both sides.\n\nLeft side O:\n\nFrom Al2(SO4)3·15H2O: 12 (from sulfate) + 15 (from water) = 27a.\n\nFrom Ca(HCO3)2: 6b. So total O left: 27a + 6b.\n\nRight side O:\n\nFrom Al(OH)3: 3c each → 3c.\n\nFrom CaSO4: 4d each → 4d.\n\nFrom CO2: 2e each → 2e.\n\nFrom H2O: f each → f.\n\nTotal O right: 3c + 4d + 2e + f.\n\nSo equation:\n\n27a + 6b = 3c + 4d + 2e + f.\n\nAgain, substitute known variables in terms of a.\n\nc = 2a, d = 3a, e = 6a, f = 15a, b = 3a.\n\nSo left side O: 27a + 6*(3a) = 27a + 18a = 45a.\n\nRight side O: 3*(2a) + 4*(3a) + 2*(6a) + 15a = 6a + 12a + 12a + 15a = 45a. Okay, that checks out. So O is balanced.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied with the relations:\n\na is a variable, and all other coefficients are in terms of a.\n\nSo we can choose a value for a. Let's choose a = 1 for simplicity.\n\nThen:\n\na = 1\n\nb = 3a = 3\n\nc = 2a = 2\n\nd = 3a = 3\n\ne = 6a = 6\n\nf = 15a = 15\n\nSo the balanced equation would be:\n\n1 Al2(SO4)3·15H2O + 3 Ca(HCO3)2 → 2 Al(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4 + 6 CO2 + 15 H2O\n\nLet me check again to make sure.\n\nLeft side elements:\n\nAl: 2*1 = 2. On right: 2*1 = 2. Good.\n\nS: 3*1 = 3. On right: 3*1 = 3. Good.\n\nCa: 3*1 = 3. On right: 3*1 = 3. Good.\n\nC: 2*3 = 6. On right: 6*1 = 6. Good.\n\nH: Left: 30*1 + 2*3 = 30 + 6 = 36. Right: 3*2 (from Al(OH)3) + 2*15 (from H2O) = 6 + 30 = 36. Good.\n\nO: Left: 27*1 + 6*3 = 27 + 18 = 45. Right: 3*2 (Al(OH)3) + 4*3 (CaSO4) + 2*6 (CO2) + 15 (H2O) = 6 + 12 + 12 + 15 = 45. Perfect.\n\nSo the balanced equation is indeed:\n\nAl2(SO4)3·15H2O + 3 Ca(HCO3)2 → 2 Al(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4 + 6 CO2 + 15 H2O\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just write it out with the coefficients to make sure there are no typos.\n\nYes, that seems to be balanced for all elements. The coefficients are 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 15. All elements are balanced. Looks good.\n</think>"}
