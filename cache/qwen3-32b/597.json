Hmm, let me think. First, the domain of a square root function requires that the expression inside the square root be non-negative. That means I need to solve the inequality:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0\n\nAlright, let me expand both squares. Let me recall that (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2. So let's compute each term.\n\nFirst, (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nThen, (x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64.\n\nSo subtracting them: (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64). Let me distribute the negative sign:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64.\n\nSimplify term by term. The x^2 terms cancel out: x^2 - x^2 = 0.\n\nThen for the x terms: -6x + 16x = 10x.\n\nFor the constants: 9 - 64 = -55.\n\nSo overall, the expression simplifies to 10x - 55.\n\nTherefore, the inequality becomes:\n\n10x - 55 ≥ 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n10x ≥ 55\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\nx ≥ 55/10\n\nSimplify:\n\nx ≥ 11/2 or x ≥ 5.5\n\nSo the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to 5.5. Therefore, the smallest real number in the domain is 5.5, which is 11/2.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal function: sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2]\n\nExpanding:\n\n(x - 3)^2 = x² -6x +9\n\n(x - 8)^2 = x² -16x +64\n\nSubtracting: (x² -6x +9) - (x² -16x +64) = x² -6x +9 -x² +16x -64 = (x² - x²) + (-6x +16x) + (9 -64) = 10x -55. That's correct.\n\nSo inequality 10x -55 ≥ 0 => x ≥ 5.5. So the domain is [5.5, ∞). Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5. So expressed as a fraction, 11/2. So the answer is 11/2. Let me check with x=5.5, does the expression inside the sqrt become zero?\n\nLet me compute (5.5 - 3)^2 - (5.5 - 8)^2.\n\nFirst, 5.5 - 3 = 2.5, and 5.5 - 8 = -2.5.\n\nSo (2.5)^2 - (-2.5)^2 = 6.25 - 6.25 = 0. So sqrt(0) is 0, which is defined. So yes, 5.5 is indeed in the domain.\n\nTherefore, the minimal x is 5.5. So in box form, it's \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I made a mistake in expanding the squares? Let me check once more.\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Alternatively, maybe I can use the difference of squares formula: a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set a = (x - 3), b = (x - 8). Then the expression becomes:\n\na² - b² = (a - b)(a + b) = [(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)].\n\nCompute each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: (x - 3 - x + 8) = (0x + 5) = 5.\n\nSecond bracket: (x - 3 + x - 8) = 2x - 11.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 5*(2x - 11) = 10x - 55. Which matches my previous result. Therefore, the inequality 10x -55 ≥ 0 => x ≥ 5.5. So same result. So that confirms that my earlier calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal x is 11/2. So the answer is 11/2. Therefore, the smallest real number in the domain is 11/2.\n\nBut let me check with another value. Let's take x = 5. Then compute inside the sqrt:\n\n(5 - 3)^2 - (5 - 8)^2 = (2)^2 - (-3)^2 = 4 - 9 = -5. Which is negative, so sqrt(-5) is not real. Therefore, x=5 is not in the domain, which is consistent with x ≥ 5.5.\n\nHow about x=6?\n\n(6 - 3)^2 - (6 - 8)^2 = (3)^2 - (-2)^2 = 9 - 4 = 5. sqrt(5) is defined. So x=6 is in the domain. And 6 is greater than 5.5, so that works.\n\nTherefore, seems like my answer is correct. Therefore, the minimal x is 11/2, which is 5.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem? Let me think. For instance, suppose I didn't notice the difference of squares. But I think my approach was solid. Expanding both squares and simplifying. Then, solving the linear inequality. Since after expanding, it turned out to be a linear expression, not quadratic. So the domain is just a ray. Therefore, the minimal x is 5.5.\n\nAlternatively, if I had a quadratic expression, I might have to find the roots and test intervals, but here it's linear, so straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest real number in the domain of $ g(x) $ is \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}.\n</think>"}
