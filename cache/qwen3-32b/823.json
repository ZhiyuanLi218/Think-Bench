I need to figure out how much current a 60 W light bulb draws when it's operating at 120 volts. Hmm, so the question is about electrical power, right? I remember there's a formula that relates power, current, and voltage. Let me think... Oh yeah, power equals voltage multiplied by current. So P = V * I.\n\nAlright, so if the power is 60 watts and the voltage is 120 volts, I can rearrange the formula to solve for current. That would be I = P / V. Plugging in the numbers, that's 60 divided by 120. Let me do the math. 60 divided by 120 is 0.5. So the current should be 0.5 amperes. Let me check the answer choices. The options are A: 0.25 A, B: 0.5 A, C: 2.00 AM, D: 4.00 AM. Wait, C and D have AM in them, which probably is a typo and should be A. But even so, 0.5 A is option B. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. Power is 60 W, voltage is 120 V. Current is power divided by voltage. 60 divided by 120 is indeed 0.5. Yeah, that makes sense. A typical household bulb at 60 watts on 120 volts would draw half an amp. The other options don't seem right. 0.25 A would be 30 watts, and 2 or 4 amps would be much higher power, like 240 or 480 watts, which is way more than a standard bulb. So yeah, B is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
