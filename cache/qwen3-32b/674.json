The question is about a phosphoric acid (H3PO4) solution with pH 2 at room temperature. There are four options (A to D) to evaluate for correctness. I need to figure out which statements are correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about H3PO4 and pH.\n\nFirst, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons (H+ ions) in solution. However, the dissociation occurs in steps. The first dissociation is the strongest, and each subsequent one is weaker. The pH of the solution is given as 2, which is quite acidic. At room temperature, the pH is related to the concentration of H+ ions by the formula pH = -log[H+]. So, if pH is 2, then [H+] = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The number of H+ ions per liter of solution is 0.02 NA. \n\nWait, if the concentration of H+ is 0.01 M, then in 1 liter of solution, the number of moles of H+ is 0.01 mol. Since Avogadro's number (NA) is the number of particles per mole, the number of H+ ions would be 0.01 NA. But the option says 0.02 NA. That seems incorrect. However, maybe I need to consider that H3PO4 can donate more than one H+? But in reality, the pH is determined primarily by the first dissociation. However, the total H+ concentration isn't just from the first dissociation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the pH is 2, which directly gives [H+] = 0.01 M. The total H+ ions in 1 liter would be 0.01 moles, so 0.01 NA. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it says 0.02 NA. So A is wrong. But maybe there's something else? For example, if the solution is 0.01 M H3PO4, but since it's a weak acid, maybe it's not fully dissociated? Wait, but the pH is given as 2, so regardless of the source, the [H+] is 0.01 M. Therefore, the number of H+ ions per liter is indeed 0.01 NA, not 0.02 NA. So A is incorrect. So A is not correct.\n\nOption B: c(H+) = c(H2PO4^-) + 2c(HPO4^2-) + 3c(PO4^3-) + c(OH-)\n\nHmm. This looks like a charge balance equation. Let me recall that in any solution, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges. For H3PO4 solution, the cations are H+ and the anions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and OH-.\n\nSo, the charge balance equation should be:\n\n[H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]\n\nYes, that seems right. Each anion contributes its charge: H2PO4^- has -1, so multiply by 1; HPO4^2- has -2, so multiply by 2; PO4^3- has -3, so multiply by 3. OH- is -1. The H+ is +1. So the equation is correct. Therefore, option B is correct. \n\nOption C: Diluting with water increases ionization degree, and the solution pH decreases.\n\nWait, when you dilute an acid, the concentration of H+ ions decreases, so pH should increase (since pH is -log[H+], lower [H+] means higher pH). But the ionization degree (alpha) might increase because dilution shifts the equilibrium to produce more ions. However, the overall effect on pH is that it becomes less acidic (pH increases). So the first part of the statement is correct (ionization degree increases), but the second part (pH decreases) is incorrect. Therefore, option C is incorrect. \n\nBut wait, maybe I need to think about the specifics of H3PO4. Since it's a weak acid, diluting it would increase the degree of ionization, but because the solution is being diluted, the actual concentration of H+ might decrease. Let me think numerically. Suppose you have a solution with pH 2. If you dilute it 10 times, the concentration of H+ would be 0.001 M, pH 3, which is higher. So pH increases, not decreases. So the statement in C says pH decreases, which is wrong. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: Adding solid NaH2PO4 enhances the acidity of the solution.\n\nNaH2PO4 is the sodium salt of dihydrogen phosphate. When dissolved in water, it dissociates into Na+ and H2PO4^-. Now, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4. Adding H2PO4^- to a solution of H3PO4 would act as a common ion effect. According to Le Chatelier's principle, adding H2PO4^- (the product of the first dissociation of H3PO4) would shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the dissociation of H3PO4. Therefore, this would decrease the concentration of H+ ions, making the solution less acidic. However, the option says it enhances the acidity. So that would be incorrect. But wait, maybe I need to think again. \n\nAlternatively, if the solution is already H3PO4, adding NaH2PO4 would create a buffer solution. A buffer resists changes in pH. However, if you add more H2PO4^- (the conjugate base), the pH would increase slightly, making it less acidic. Therefore, the acidity would decrease, not enhance. Hence, option D is incorrect. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. If the original solution is H3PO4 with pH 2, which is already partially dissociated. Adding NaH2PO4, which is a salt that provides H2PO4^- ions. Since H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to become HPO4^2-), but in this case, adding it would increase the concentration of H2PO4^-, which is the conjugate base. The presence of more H2PO4^- would suppress the dissociation of H3PO4, leading to lower [H+], hence higher pH, less acidic. Therefore, the acidity is not enhanced. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nA: Incorrect. B: Correct. C: Incorrect. D: Incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each part again to be sure.\n\nFor option B, the charge balance equation: [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]. Yes, that's correct. In any solution, the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges. Since the only cation here is H+ (assuming Na+ isn't present unless added, but the original solution is H3PO4, so no Na+ unless added). Therefore, the equation is correct. So B is correct.\n\nOption D: Adding NaH2PO4. Let me think again. Suppose the original solution is H3PO4. Adding NaH2PO4 adds H2PO4^- which is a conjugate base. The H3PO4 dissociates into H+ and H2PO4^-. Adding more H2PO4^- would shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing [H+], making the solution less acidic. Therefore, the acidity is reduced. So D is incorrect. Hence, the answer is B.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where adding H2PO4^- could increase acidity? For example, if the solution was not H3PO4 but something else. But in this case, the solution is H3PO4. So adding a salt that provides H2PO4^- would act as a buffer. The pH of the buffer would depend on the ratio of H3PO4 and H2PO4^-. However, the question says \"enhances the acidity\", which would mean making it more acidic (lower pH). But adding H2PO4^- would buffer the solution, making it resist changes. If the original solution is H3PO4, which is a weak acid, adding its conjugate base would make it a buffer with a pH higher than the original solution. Hence, less acidic. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
