The committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. Let me start by recalling some combinatorial principles related to circular permutations and grouping.\n\nFirst, when arranging people around a circular table, the number of linear arrangements is divided by the number of seats because rotations are considered the same. For example, n people can be arranged in (n-1)! ways around a circular table. But here, we have additional constraints: each party must sit together. So, maybe I can treat each party as a single \"block\" first and then consider the arrangements within each block?\n\nLet me think. If we consider each party as a single unit, there are 3 units: Democrats (D), Republicans (R), and Independent (I). Since it's a circular table, arranging these 3 units around the table. Normally, for circular permutations of k units, it would be (k-1)! So here, that would be (3-1)! = 2! ways. But wait, the Independent is just one person, but they still count as a block, right? Yes, even though there's only one person, we can still think of them as a block. So arranging the three blocks around the table: 2! ways.\n\nBut then, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways. The Independent is just one person, so there's only 1! = 1 way to arrange them. Therefore, the total number of arrangements would be 2! * 5! * 5! * 1!.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if there's something missing here. The problem says \"all the members of each party all sit next to each other.\" Since the Independent is a party of one, they just need to sit next to themselves, which is trivially satisfied. So treating them as a block is correct.\n\nBut let me think again about circular permutations with blocks. When arranging the blocks around the table, since it's circular, fixing one position to account for rotational symmetry. So if we have three blocks, the number of ways to arrange them is indeed (3-1)! = 2. So that part seems okay.\n\nSo multiplying by the internal arrangements of each block: Democrats can be arranged in 5! ways, Republicans in 5! ways, and Independent in 1 way. Therefore, total arrangements: 2! * 5! * 5!.\n\nBut let me verify if there's a catch here. For example, sometimes with circular permutations and blocks, there can be issues with reflections or something else? Wait, the problem says two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other. It doesn't mention reflections. So reflections are considered different. For example, if you have a clockwise arrangement versus counter-clockwise, they are different. Therefore, in our calculation, we accounted for rotations by fixing the position of the blocks, but reflections would be different arrangements. Since reflections aren't considered equivalent, our calculation is okay.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If we fix one block to account for rotational symmetry, then arrange the others relative to it. For example, fix the Democrats block in a position, then arrange the other two blocks (Republicans and Independent) around the table. Since it's a circle, fixing one block removes the rotational symmetry. Then, arranging the remaining two blocks can be done in 2! ways. So that gives 2! for the blocks. Then multiply by internal arrangements. So yes, same result: 2! * 5! * 5!.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't fix positions, the number of circular permutations of three blocks is (3-1)! = 2, which is the same as 2!.\n\nSo, that seems okay.\n\nBut let me check with numbers. Let's take a simpler case. Suppose there are 2 blocks around a circular table. How many arrangements? It should be (2-1)! = 1. But if you have two blocks, they can be arranged in only 1 way around a circular table? Wait, no. Wait, if you have two blocks, say A and B, around a circular table. If you fix block A in a position, then block B can be either to the left or to the right. But in a circular table, left and right are relative. Wait, actually, if you fix block A, then block B can only be arranged in 1 way because rotating the table can make left and right equivalent. Wait, but if you have two blocks, the number of distinct arrangements is 1, because you can rotate the table so that block A is in any position, and block B is opposite. But if you consider direction, like clockwise or counter-clockwise?\n\nWait, actually, for two blocks around a circular table, there is only 1 unique arrangement, because you can rotate the table so that the first block is anywhere, and the second block is just opposite. However, if reflections are considered different, then if you have two blocks, there is only one way to arrange them. Wait, but if you have two blocks, and you can have them in two different orders? For example, if you have block A and block B, then going clockwise around the table, you can have A followed by B or B followed by A. But since it's a circle, these two are rotations of each other if you consider the entire table. Wait, no. If you have two blocks, then rotating the table by half the table's circumference would turn A followed by B into B followed by A. Therefore, if rotations are considered equivalent, then these two are equivalent. Therefore, there is only 1 way to arrange two blocks around a circular table. But if reflections are considered different, then reflections would be different. Wait, but reflections would require flipping the table, which is not a rotation.\n\nSo, in our problem, the question says that two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other. So reflections are considered different. Therefore, if we have two blocks, there is only 1 arrangement up to rotation. However, if we have three blocks, the number of arrangements is 2. Let me check with three blocks. Suppose blocks A, B, C. Fix block A in a position. Then blocks B and C can be arranged in 2 ways: B then C or C then B clockwise. Therefore, (3-1)! = 2, which matches. Therefore, in our problem, with three blocks, we have 2! arrangements for the blocks.\n\nTherefore, going back, our calculation of 2! * 5! * 5! seems okay.\n\nBut let me check again the problem statement: \"all the members of each party all sit next to each other\". So each party is a block. The Independent is a block of size 1. So yes, we need to arrange three blocks around the table, which can be done in 2! ways, then multiply by permutations within each block: 5! for Democrats, 5! for Republicans, 1! for Independent. Therefore total number of seating arrangements is 2! * 5! * 5! * 1!.\n\nCalculating that: 2 * 120 * 120 * 1 = 2 * 14400 = 28,800.\n\nBut wait, before finalizing, let me check if there is a mistake here. Sometimes with circular permutations and blocks, there might be an overcounting or undercounting.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think of each block as a single entity. So first, arrange the three blocks around the circular table. As mentioned, that is (3-1)! = 2 ways. Then, for each block, arrange the people inside. For the Democrats, 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways, same for Republicans, and the Independent is 1 way. Therefore, total arrangements: 2 * 5! * 5!.\n\nYes, same as before. So 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800. So 28,800 ways. Is that the answer?\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, but sometimes when dealing with circular permutations with blocks, if the blocks have symmetries themselves, you have to consider that. But in this case, each block is a linear arrangement. Since the blocks are arranged in a circle, but within each block, the arrangement is linear. However, when you rotate the entire block, that is already accounted for in the circular permutation of the blocks. Wait, no. For example, once we fix the arrangement of the blocks around the table, the blocks themselves can be rotated? No, because within each block, we have considered all possible linear arrangements. For example, for the Democrats block, we have considered all 5! permutations. Since the block is treated as a single unit in the circular arrangement, but internally, the order matters. Therefore, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of it as a linear arrangement first and then adjust for circularity. If we had arranged the three blocks in a line, that would be 3! ways, and then multiplied by internal arrangements. But since it's a circle, we divide by the number of rotations, which is 3? Wait, no. Wait, in linear arrangements, it's 3! * 5! * 5! * 1! But for circular arrangements, it's (3-1)! * 5! * 5! * 1! So same as before. Therefore, 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800. So that seems okay.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example. Suppose there are 2 Democrats (D1, D2), 2 Republicans (R1, R2), and 1 Independent (I). How many circular arrangements with each party sitting together?\n\nUsing the same logic: 3 blocks, circular permutations: (3-1)! = 2. Internal arrangements: 2! for Democrats, 2! for Republicans, 1! for Independent. Total: 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 8.\n\nLet me enumerate them to check. First, fix the blocks. Let's fix the Democrats block. Then the other two blocks can be [R, I] or [I, R]. So two possibilities for the order of blocks.\n\nFor each of these, Democrats can be arranged as D1D2 or D2D1 (2 ways), Republicans as R1R2 or R2R1 (2 ways), and Independent is fixed. Therefore total arrangements: 2 (block orders) * 2 * 2 = 8. Let's imagine the actual seating.\n\nIf we fix Democrats in positions 1-2, then:\n\nCase 1: Block order D, R, I.\n\nPossible arrangements:\n\nD1 D2 R1 R2 I\n\nD1 D2 R2 R1 I\n\nD2 D1 R1 R2 I\n\nD2 D1 R2 R1 I\n\nThen rotated versions? Wait, but since it's a circular table, we fixed the Democrats block. However, the actual positions would be:\n\nBut since we fixed the Democrats block, rotations are already accounted for. However, the problem is that the Independent is a single person. Let me think of the circular table with the three blocks: D, R, I. If we fix the D block, then the arrangement is either D-R-I or D-I-R going clockwise. Each of these is different because you can't rotate one into the other (since there are three blocks). So two possibilities. Then multiplied by internal arrangements.\n\nSo in total 2*2*2=8. Let me see if that's correct. If I consider all possible circular arrangements without fixing anything, how many would there be?\n\nIn linear terms, arranging the three blocks: 3! * 2! * 2! * 1! = 6*2*2=24. But since circular, divide by 3 (number of blocks?), getting 8. Yes, same result. Therefore, our formula works here.\n\nTherefore, returning to original problem, with 5 D, 5 R, 1 I. So answer is 2! * 5! * 5! = 2*120*120=28,800.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose we didn't treat the blocks first. How would we approach it?\n\nFirst, since it's a circular table, let's fix the position of the Independent to eliminate rotational symmetry. Since the Independent is a single person, but they have to sit with their party (themselves). Wait, but fixing the Independent's position would be one way to handle circular permutations.\n\nIf we fix the Independent in a specific seat, then the rest of the arrangement is determined relative to that. Now, since each party must sit together, the Democrats must form a consecutive block and the Republicans must form a consecutive block.\n\nSo, with the Independent fixed in one seat, we need to arrange the two blocks (D and R) around the table. Since the table is circular but we've fixed the Independent's position, the problem reduces to arranging the two blocks in the remaining seats.\n\nBut how many ways are there? Once the Independent is fixed, the two blocks can be placed in two different ways: Democrats to the left of the Independent and Republicans to the right, or Republicans to the left and Democrats to the right. However, since it's a circular table, but we fixed the Independent's position, left and right are specific directions. Therefore, there are 2 ways to arrange the blocks: D then R or R then D relative to the Independent.\n\nWait, but once the Independent is fixed, the arrangement is linear in a way. Let me visualize. Imagine the table with the Independent fixed at the top. Then, going clockwise around the table, we can have the Democrats block followed by the Republicans block, or the Republicans block followed by the Democrats block. So two possibilities.\n\nThen, for each of these, the Democrats can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways, and Republicans in 5! ways. Therefore, total arrangements: 2 * 5! * 5! = same as before, 2*120*120=28,800. Therefore, same answer. So this method also gives the same result. Therefore, this reinforces that the answer is 28,800.\n\nBut let me think if there is another way someone might approach this problem and perhaps make a mistake. For example, someone might think that since there are three blocks, the number of circular arrangements is (3-1)! and then multiply by the permutations within each block. Which is exactly what I did. So that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, someone might forget that the Independent is a single person and think that there are two blocks (D and R) and the Independent is not a block, but that would be incorrect because the problem states that all members of each party must sit next to each other. Since the Independent is a party (even though only one person), they need to sit next to themselves, which they inherently do. Therefore, they must be considered as a block as well. Therefore, three blocks total.\n\nAnother possible mistake: thinking that because the Independent is only one person, maybe they can be placed between the two other blocks in some way that affects the count. But no, since we already considered the three blocks.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that the Independent can be part of another block, but the problem states that members of each party must sit together. Since the Independent is a separate party, they cannot be part of the Democrats or Republicans.\n\nTherefore, all possibilities seem to be covered.\n\nWait, but let me check if there is an issue with the blocks themselves. For example, when arranging the blocks around the table, each block is a group of people sitting consecutively. However, in circular arrangements, sometimes the starting point can affect things, but since we've already accounted for rotational symmetry by using (number of blocks - 1)!.\n\nTherefore, I think that the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, final answer is 2! * 5! * 5! = 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800. Therefore, 28,800 ways.\n\nBut let me check once more with another method. Suppose we consider the entire seating arrangement as a permutation where each party is a block. In linear arrangements, the number would be 3! * 5! * 5! * 1! because we can arrange the three blocks in 3! ways and each block internally in their respective factorials. But since it's a circular table, we divide by the number of seats? Wait, no. Wait, in circular permutations, when converting from linear to circular, you divide by the number of positions because rotations are equivalent. However, when dealing with blocks, perhaps we need to adjust accordingly.\n\nBut here's another way: if we have three blocks, let's consider the number of linear arrangements as 3! * 5! * 5! * 1!. To convert this to circular arrangements, we divide by the number of blocks, because in circular permutations, rotating the blocks would lead to equivalent arrangements. Therefore, circular arrangements would be (3! / 3) * 5! * 5! * 1! = 2! * 5! * 5! * 1! which is the same as before. Therefore, this method also gives 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think that this confirms the answer is 28,800. Therefore, I can write that as the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of ways is \\boxed{28800}.\n</think>"}
