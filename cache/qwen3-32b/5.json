Let me write that down first to make sure I have it right. \n\nThe numerator is the square root of (2.5 squared minus 0.7 squared), and the denominator is 2.7 minus 2.5. Alright. Let me start by simplifying the denominator first because that looks straightforward. \n\n2.7 minus 2.5... Hmm, subtracting those decimals. Let me do that. 2.7 minus 2.5 is 0.2. So the denominator is 0.2. Got that part. \n\nNow the numerator is the square root of (2.5 squared minus 0.7 squared). Let me compute 2.5 squared and 0.7 squared separately. \n\nFirst, 2.5 squared. 2.5 times 2.5... Well, 2 times 2.5 is 5, and 0.5 times 2.5 is 1.25, so adding them together gives 5 + 1.25 = 6.25. Wait, no, actually, that's not the right way to think about it. Wait, 2.5 squared is just 2.5 multiplied by itself. Let me do it step by step. \n\n2.5 * 2.5. Let me convert them to fractions maybe? 2.5 is 5/2, right? So (5/2) squared is 25/4, which is 6.25. Yeah, that's correct. Alternatively, 2.5 * 2.5: 2*2 is 4, 2*0.5 is 1, 0.5*2 is 1, and 0.5*0.5 is 0.25. Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 0.25 = 6.25. Yep, same result. So 2.5 squared is 6.25. \n\nNow 0.7 squared. 0.7 * 0.7. Well, 0.7 is 7/10, so (7/10)^2 is 49/100, which is 0.49. Alternatively, multiplying decimals: 0.7*0.7. 7*7 is 49, and since there are two decimal places, it's 0.49. Correct. \n\nSo the numerator inside the square root is 6.25 - 0.49. Let me compute that. \n\n6.25 minus 0.49. Let me do this subtraction. Starting with 6.25 - 0.49. Let me think of it as 6.25 - 0.45 - 0.04. 6.25 - 0.45 is 5.80, and then subtract 0.04 gives 5.76. Alternatively, I can do it straight:\n\n6.25\n-0.49\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit: 5 - 9. Hmm, can't do that, so borrow. The tenths place is 2, so borrow from the units place. Wait, 6.25 is 6 units, 2 tenths, 5 hundredths. So subtract 0.49 which is 0 units, 4 tenths, 9 hundredths. \n\nStarting with hundredths: 5 - 9. Need to borrow. So take 1 tenth from the tenths place. The tenths place is 2, so becomes 1, and the hundredths become 15. Then 15 - 9 = 6. \n\nNow tenths place: 1 (after borrowing) minus 4. Again, can't do that, so need to borrow from the units. The units are 6, so borrow 1, making it 5, and the tenths become 11. Then subtract 4 tenths: 11 - 4 = 7. \n\nUnits place: 5 (after borrowing) minus 0 is 5. \n\nSo altogether, 5.76. So the numerator inside the square root is 5.76. \n\nSo now the numerator is sqrt(5.76). Let me figure out what sqrt(5.76) is. Hmm. \n\nI know that 2.4 squared is 5.76? Let me check. 2.4 * 2.4. 2*2 is 4, 2*0.4 is 0.8, 0.4*2 is 0.8, 0.4*0.4 is 0.16. Adding them up: 4 + 0.8 + 0.8 + 0.16 = 5.76. Yes! So sqrt(5.76) is 2.4. \n\nTherefore, the numerator simplifies to 2.4 and the denominator is 0.2. So the entire expression becomes 2.4 divided by 0.2. \n\nNow, dividing 2.4 by 0.2. Let me think. Dividing by 0.2 is the same as multiplying by 5, since 1/0.2 is 5. So 2.4 * 5. Let me compute that. \n\n2.4 * 5. Well, 2 * 5 is 10, and 0.4 * 5 is 2, so total is 10 + 2 = 12. Therefore, 2.4 divided by 0.2 is 12. \n\nSo the simplified value of the expression is 12. Let me just recap all the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, denominator: 2.7 - 2.5 = 0.2. Correct. \n\nNumerator: sqrt(2.5² - 0.7²). Calculated 2.5² as 6.25 and 0.7² as 0.49. Then 6.25 - 0.49 is 5.76. Square root of 5.76 is 2.4. Then 2.4 divided by 0.2 is 12. Seems all steps check out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach the numerator? Let me think. The numerator is sqrt(a² - b²). Which can be factored as sqrt((a - b)(a + b)). Maybe that would make it easier? Let me try that approach. \n\nSo, sqrt[(2.5 - 0.7)(2.5 + 0.7)]. Let me compute 2.5 - 0.7 and 2.5 + 0.7. \n\n2.5 - 0.7 is 1.8. \n\n2.5 + 0.7 is 3.2. \n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes sqrt(1.8 * 3.2). Let me compute 1.8 * 3.2. \n\nHmm, 1.8 * 3.2. Let me do 1.8 * 3 + 1.8 * 0.2. \n\n1.8 * 3 is 5.4. \n\n1.8 * 0.2 is 0.36. \n\nAdding them together: 5.4 + 0.36 = 5.76. Same as before. Then sqrt(5.76) is 2.4. So same result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, we get 2.4 / 0.2 = 12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to see this without decimal calculations? Let me try converting all decimals to fractions. \n\nOriginal expression: sqrt(2.5² - 0.7²)/(2.7 - 2.5). \n\nFirst, convert 2.5 to 5/2, 0.7 to 7/10, 2.7 to 27/10, and 2.5 is 5/2. \n\nSo let's rewrite the expression:\n\nNumerator: sqrt[( (5/2)^2 - (7/10)^2 )]\n\nDenominator: 27/10 - 5/2. \n\nLet me compute the denominator first. \n\n27/10 - 5/2. To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator. The common denominator is 10. \n\n5/2 is equal to 25/10. \n\nSo 27/10 - 25/10 = 2/10 = 1/5. \n\nSo denominator is 1/5. \n\nNow numerator: sqrt[ (25/4 - 49/100) ]\n\nCompute 25/4 - 49/100. Let's convert them to have a common denominator. The common denominator is 100. \n\n25/4 is equal to (25 * 25)/100? Wait, no. Wait, 25/4 multiplied by 25? Wait, no. To convert 25/4 to 100 denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by 25? Wait, 4 * 25 is 100. Yes. \n\nSo 25/4 = (25 * 25)/ (4 * 25) = 625/100. \n\nWait, 25 * 25 is 625. Yes. \n\nThen subtract 49/100. \n\nSo 625/100 - 49/100 = (625 - 49)/100 = 576/100. \n\nTherefore, the numerator is sqrt(576/100). \n\nsqrt(576)/sqrt(100) = 24/10 = 12/5. \n\nSo numerator is 12/5 and denominator is 1/5. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is (12/5) divided by (1/5) = (12/5) * (5/1) = 12. \n\nSame result! So converting to fractions also gives 12. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, decimal or fractions, the answer is 12. \n\nLet me check once more with decimal calculations. \n\nOriginal expression: sqrt(2.5² - 0.7²)/(2.7 - 2.5). \n\n2.5 squared is 6.25, 0.7 squared is 0.49. 6.25 - 0.49 is 5.76. Square root of 5.76 is 2.4. Denominator is 0.2. 2.4 divided by 0.2 is 12. Yep. \n\nSo all methods confirm that the answer is 12. Therefore, the simplified value of the given expression is 12. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. All steps make sense and cross-verifying with different methods gives the same answer, so I'm confident that 12 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>"}
