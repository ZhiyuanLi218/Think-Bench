As a result, the W bosons possess **non-Abelian self-interactions**. These include both **triple (W-W-W)** and **quartic (W-W-W-W)** interaction vertices in the SM Lagrangian.

The QCD Lagrangian includes **three-gluon (g-g-g)** and **four-gluon (g-g-g-g)** interaction terms.

However, in the SM, all quark interactions are **mediated by gauge bosons** (gluons, photons, W/Z bosons). There is **no four-fermion (qqqq) interaction** in the SM Lagrangian at the fundamental level. All quark interactions are through **three-point vertices** (e.g., quark-quark-gluon, quark-quark-photon), and four-fermion processes (like qq → qq) must occur via **exchange of a gauge boson**, not a single vertex.\n\n❌ **Cannot occur at a single vertex.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: HH → HH**\n\nThe Higgs boson has a **self-interaction potential** in the SM, which includes a **quartic term** in the Higgs field.

The options are WW→WW, gg→gg, qq→qq, and HH→HH. Let me start by recalling what the Standard Model interactions are and which particles interact directly through a single vertex.\n\nFirst, let me remember the SM particles and their interactions. The SM includes quarks (q), leptons, gauge bosons (like W, Z, photon, gluons g), and the Higgs boson H. The interactions are governed by the gauge symmetries SU(3)c × SU(2)L × U(1)Y.\n\nFor each process, I need to check if there is a direct interaction vertex in the SM that allows that process. If there is, then it can occur at a single vertex. If not, then it can't.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: WW→WW. Are there interactions between four W bosons? I know that gauge bosons can self-interact because of the non-Abelian nature of the SU(2)L and SU(3)c groups. For example, gluons (which are part of SU(3)c) have three and four-gluon vertices. Similarly, W bosons, being part of the SU(2)L group, should have self-interactions. So, there should be a four-W vertex? Or maybe three-W vertices? Wait, the three-W vertex exists, but for four Ws, maybe through some combination? Let me think. In the SM, the gauge boson interactions come from the field strength tensors. For non-Abelian groups, the field strength tensor includes a term with the structure constants times the gauge fields. When you write down the Lagrangian, you get terms like (Wμν)^2, which would include terms with two Ws, but also when you expand the field strength tensor, you get terms with three and four gauge bosons. Therefore, there are three-point and four-point interactions for the W bosons. So, a four-W vertex exists. Therefore, WW→WW can occur at a single vertex. So A is possible.\n\nOption B: gg→gg. Gluons are the gauge bosons of SU(3)c, which is non-Abelian. Therefore, similar to the Ws, gluons have three and four-gluon vertices. The QCD Lagrangian includes terms like f^{abc}f^{ade}g^μνg^ρσ... (I'm not writing the exact terms, but the point is that there are three and four-gluon vertices). Therefore, there is a four-gluon vertex? Or is it only three-gluon? Wait, the four-gluon vertex does exist. For example, in QCD, the four-gluon interaction is present in the Lagrangian. So, gg→gg can occur via a single four-gluon vertex. Therefore, B is possible.\n\nOption C: qq→qq. Quarks interact via the strong force (gluons), weak force (W and Z), and electromagnetic (photon). But the question is about a direct interaction at a single vertex. So, for quarks, can they interact directly with each other without exchanging another particle? Well, in QED, electrons interact via photons, but there's no direct electron-electron vertex. Similarly, quarks interact via gluons in QCD. However, in the Standard Model, there isn't a direct four-fermion interaction (like two quarks going to two quarks) at the tree level except for some specific cases. Wait, except for the case of weak interactions. For example, in the weak interaction, there are processes like quark-antiquark → quark-antiquark via Z boson or photon exchange. But is there a direct four-fermion interaction? In the SM, the only four-fermion interactions are the ones that are generated by the exchange of W, Z, or photons at low energies (as effective interactions), but they aren't part of the fundamental vertices of the SM. The fundamental vertices are three-point: like quark-quark-gluon, quark-quark-photon, quark-quark-Z, quark-quark-W (for transitions), etc. Therefore, a direct qq→qq process would require a four-fermion vertex, which is not present in the SM. Therefore, such a process cannot occur at a single vertex. Wait, but wait, maybe in some other way? For example, if two quarks annihilate into a gluon which then splits into two quarks? But that would be a two-step process (s-channel gluon exchange), not a single vertex. Similarly for other bosons. So, there is no single vertex for qq→qq. Therefore, option C cannot occur at a single SM vertex. But wait, let me check again. Are there any four-fermion interactions in the SM? The SM does not have four-fermion contact interactions as fundamental interactions. All interactions between fermions are via gauge boson exchange. Therefore, the answer for C is that it cannot occur at a single vertex. But hold on, what about the case of quarks interacting via a Higgs? For example, if two quarks go into a Higgs and then out into two quarks? But again, that would be a s-channel Higgs exchange, which is two vertices. There's no four-fermion Higgs vertex. So, no. Therefore, C cannot occur at a single vertex.\n\nOption D: HH→HH. The Higgs boson in the SM has a self-interaction potential. The Higgs potential is given by -μ²Φ†Φ + λ(Φ†Φ)^2, where Φ is the Higgs doublet. After symmetry breaking, this gives rise to a potential for the physical Higgs boson. The quartic term λ(Φ†Φ)^2 leads to a trilinear and a quartic coupling for the Higgs. Specifically, the quartic coupling would give a four-Higgs vertex? Wait, no, the quartic term is (H^4) if we consider the physical Higgs field. Wait, let me think. The Higgs potential is written as:\n\nV(Φ) = -μ² Φ†Φ + λ (Φ†Φ)^2.\n\nAfter symmetry breaking, Φ = (0, v + H/√2)^T, where v is the vacuum expectation value. Then, substituting into the potential, we get terms like λ v² H² + ... and also a term λ H^4. So, the Higgs self-interactions include a quartic term λ H^4. Therefore, there is a four-Higgs vertex with coupling λ. Therefore, HH→HH can occur at a single vertex. So D is possible.\n\nTherefore, the one that cannot occur is option C: qq→qq. But wait, let me check again. Wait, is there any case where quarks can have a four-fermion interaction? For example, in the case of neutrinoless double beta decay, there are four-fermion interactions, but those are effective interactions from the exchange of W bosons. But in the SM itself, there is no fundamental four-fermion vertex. All quark interactions are through gauge bosons. So yes, qq→qq cannot happen at a single vertex. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, let me cross-verify. Let me think about each of the four options again.\n\nA: WW→WW. Yes, because there is a four-W vertex in the SM. For example, in the electroweak theory, the W's have triple and quartic gauge couplings. So this is allowed.\n\nB: gg→gg. Yes, because QCD has a four-gluon vertex.\n\nC: qq→qq. No, because there's no four-fermion interaction in the SM. Quarks interact via gauge bosons, so this would require two vertices (like a quark-quark-gluon and then gluon-quark-quark), so it's a two-step process, not a single vertex.\n\nD: HH→HH. Yes, as the Higgs has a quartic self-coupling.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, wait, I just thought of another possibility. What about the case of quark-antiquark → quark-antiquark? For example, in QED, e+ e- → e+ e- can occur via a t-channel photon exchange, but is there a four-fermion contact interaction? No, unless you have some high-energy effective theory. In the SM, the fundamental interactions are three-point. So same with quarks. So even quark-antiquark → quark-antiquark is done via gauge boson exchange, not a single vertex. So yes, option C is impossible at a single vertex.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: qq→qq.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Let me think about the vertices in the SM Lagrangian.\n\nThe SM Lagrangian includes terms like:\n\n- For gauge bosons: terms like (W^a_{μν})^2, which expand to include three and four W vertices.\n\n- For gluons: similar terms with structure constants leading to three and four-gluon vertices.\n\n- For Higgs: the quartic term λ H^4, so four-Higgs vertex.\n\n- For fermions: Yukawa couplings (fermion-fermion-Higgs), and gauge couplings (fermion-fermion-gauge boson).\n\nTherefore, there is no four-fermion term in the SM Lagrangian. All interactions between fermions are either via a gauge boson or a Higgs. Therefore, a process like qq→qq cannot proceed via a single vertex. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the answer is option C.\n</think>"}
