Let me start by recalling what I know about thermodynamic equilibrium and the conditions under which diamond and graphite are stable.\n\nFirst, I remember that the stability of different phases (like diamond vs. graphite) depends on temperature and pressure. The phase with the lower Gibbs free energy is the stable one under given conditions. Since they are in equilibrium in the magma chamber, the Gibbs free energy of diamond and graphite must be equal at the original temperature and pressure. When the temperature increases, the pressure must also change to keep them in equilibrium. \n\nThe problem gives me the molar volumes and molar entropies for both diamond and graphite. I need to relate the change in temperature and pressure to maintain equilibrium. I think the key here is the Gibbs free energy change with temperature and pressure. \n\nThe fundamental equation for Gibbs free energy is dG = VdP - SdT. Since the system is at equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy of diamond and graphite must remain equal. So, the change in Gibbs free energy for diamond and graphite should be the same when temperature and pressure change. \n\nLet me write that out. For diamond and graphite, the change in Gibbs free energy when going from initial to final conditions should be equal. So:\n\ndG_diamond = V_diamond dP - S_diamond dT\ndG_graphite = V_graphite dP - S_graphite dT\n\nBut since they are in equilibrium, dG_diamond = dG_graphite = 0. Therefore:\n\nV_diamond dP - S_diamond dT = V_graphite dP - S_graphite dT\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n(V_diamond - V_graphite) dP = (S_diamond - S_graphite) dT\n\nSolving for dP:\n\ndP = [(S_diamond - S_graphite) / (V_diamond - V_graphite)] dT\n\nWait, let me check the signs. Let me do the algebra again. \n\nStarting from:\n\nV_d dP - S_d dT = V_g dP - S_g dT\n\nBring terms with dP to one side and terms with dT to the other:\n\n(V_d - V_g) dP = (S_d - S_g) dT\n\nSo:\n\ndP = [ (S_d - S_g) / (V_d - V_g) ] dT\n\nBut let's plug in the numbers. Let me note the given values:\n\nFor diamond:\n- Molar volume, V_d = 3.417 cm³/mol = 3.417 × 10⁻⁶ m³/mol (since 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³)\n- Molar entropy, S_d = 2.38 J/K/mol\n\nFor graphite:\n- Molar volume, V_g = 5.298 cm³/mol = 5.298 × 10⁻⁶ m³/mol\n- Molar entropy, S_g = 5.74 J/K/mol\n\nTemperature change, dT = +100.0 K\n\nSo, compute numerator: S_d - S_g = 2.38 - 5.74 = -3.36 J/K/mol\n\nDenominator: V_d - V_g = 3.417 - 5.298 = -1.881 cm³/mol = -1.881 × 10⁻⁶ m³/mol\n\nTherefore:\n\ndP = [ (-3.36 J/K/mol) / (-1.881 × 10⁻⁶ m³/mol) ] × 100 K\n\nThe negatives cancel out, so:\n\ndP = (3.36 / 1.881 × 10⁻⁶) × 100 J/(m³·K) × K\n\nWait, let's check the units. The entropy is in J/K/mol, and molar volume is in m³/mol. So when we divide entropy by volume, we get (J/K/mol) / (m³/mol) = J/(K·m³). Then multiply by dT (K), so the units become J/m³. Since 1 J/m³ is 1 Pa. Therefore, the result will be in Pascals.\n\nLet me compute the numerical value:\n\nFirst compute 3.36 / 1.881 ≈ 1.786\n\nThen multiply by 100: 1.786 × 100 = 178.6\n\nThen divide by 1e-6 (since denominator is 1.881e-6):\n\nWait, no. Wait the calculation is:\n\n(3.36 / 1.881) × 100 / 1e-6 ?\n\nWait, let me redo the calculation step by step:\n\nNumerator: 3.36 J/K/mol * 100 K = 336 J/mol\n\nDenominator: 1.881 × 10⁻⁶ m³/mol\n\nSo dP = (336 J/mol) / (1.881 × 10⁻⁶ m³/mol) = 336 / 1.881 × 10⁶ Pa\n\nBecause J/m³ is Pa. And the mol cancels out.\n\nCalculating 336 / 1.881 ≈ let's compute that.\n\nFirst approximate 1.881 × 178 ≈ 1.881 × 178. Let me compute 1.881 × 178:\n\nWell, 1.881 × 100 = 188.1\n\n1.881 × 70 = 131.67\n\n1.881 × 8 = 15.048\n\nTotal ≈ 188.1 + 131.67 = 319.77 + 15.048 ≈ 334.818. So 1.881 × 178 ≈ 334.8. Which is very close to 336. So 336 / 1.881 ≈ 178.6 (since 1.881 × 178.6 ≈ 336). Therefore:\n\ndP ≈ 178.6 × 10⁶ Pa\n\nConvert Pascals to bars. I know that 1 bar = 10⁵ Pa. Therefore:\n\ndP ≈ 178.6 × 10⁶ Pa × (1 bar / 10⁵ Pa) = 178.6 × 10¹ bar = 1786 bar.\n\nSo the pressure must increase by approximately 1786 bar. Let me check the options. Option B is 1786 bar. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me check if I made any sign errors. The original equation was dP = [(S_d - S_g)/(V_d - V_g)] dT. Since S_d - S_g is negative and V_d - V_g is also negative, their ratio is positive. Therefore, dP is positive. So the pressure should increase, which matches with the options given (all options are increases). Therefore, the answer is B: 1786 bar.\n\nLet me verify the calculation again for accuracy.\n\nCompute S_d - S_g = 2.38 - 5.74 = -3.36 J/K/mol.\n\nV_d - V_g = 3.417 - 5.298 = -1.881 cm³/mol. Converting to m³/mol: -1.881 × 10⁻⁶ m³/mol.\n\ndT = +100 K.\n\nSo dP = [(-3.36 J/K/mol) / (-1.881 × 10⁻⁶ m³/mol)] × 100 K.\n\nWhich is (3.36 / 1.881 × 10⁻⁶) × 100 J/(m³·K) × K → J/m³ = Pa.\n\nSo 3.36 / 1.881 = approx 1.786. Then 1.786 × 100 = 178.6. Then divided by 1e-6? Wait no, it's multiplied by 1/(1e-6). Because denominator is 1.881e-6, so 3.36 / 1.881e-6 = 3.36 / 1.881 * 1e6.\n\nYes, exactly. So 3.36 / 1.881 is approx 1.786. Then 1.786 × 1e6 Pa × 100? Wait no, wait the 100 is already included. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe formula is dP = [ (S_d - S_g) / (V_d - V_g) ] × dT\n\nSo plugging numbers:\n\n( (-3.36) / (-1.881e-6) ) × 100 = (3.36 / 1.881e-6) × 100\n\nWhich is (3.36 × 100 / 1.881) × 1e6 Pa? Wait no:\n\nWait, 3.36 / 1.881e-6 = 3.36 / 1.881 × 1e6 ≈ 1.786 × 1e6 Pa per K. Then multiplied by 100 K gives 1.786 × 1e6 × 100 Pa = 1.786 × 1e8 Pa. Then converting to bar:\n\nSince 1 bar = 1e5 Pa, then 1.786 × 1e8 Pa / 1e5 Pa/bar = 1.786 × 1e3 bar = 1786 bar. Exactly. So yes, 1786 bar. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me check if there's any possible mistake in the formula. The derivation was based on the equality of Gibbs free energy changes. Since dG = 0 for both phases at equilibrium, so setting their dG expressions equal. That seems right. Also, the formula dP/dT = (S2 - S1)/(V2 - V1) is known from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the slope of the phase boundary. Wait, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is usually written as dP/dT = (ΔS)/(ΔV), where ΔS and ΔV are the differences in entropy and volume between the two phases. In this case, since we're dealing with two phases (diamond and graphite), the same applies. So the formula I used is indeed the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Therefore, the approach is correct.\n\nSo yes, the answer is B: The pressure has to increase by 1786 bar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
