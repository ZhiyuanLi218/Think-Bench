The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian and tells me the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to determine which of the options A, B, C, D is correct.\n\nFirst, the interaction term is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(y) = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\left( \\upsilon + X(y) \\right) \\psi_f(y)\n$$\n\nSo, this looks like a Yukawa-type interaction. The general form of a Yukawa coupling is something like $ -g \\bar{\\psi} \\phi \\psi $, where $ \\phi $ is a scalar field and $ \\psi $ is a fermion field. In this case, the scalar field is X, and there's also a vacuum expectation value (vev) $ \\upsilon $. The presence of the vev would typically give mass to the fermions, but here we are concerned with the interaction term involving X.\n\nSo, the coupling between X and fermions is linear in X, meaning that when we expand around the vev, the term with X will mediate interactions. The strength of the coupling is given by $ \\lambda_f $, which might depend on the fermion type f. However, the problem doesn't specify different couplings for different fermions, so maybe we can assume they all couple with the same strength? Although in reality, Yukawa couplings vary, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we don't need to worry about that for the purposes of kinematics.\n\nNow, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. We need to find which decays are kinematically allowed. Kinematically allowed means that the decay is permitted by energy-momentum conservation, i.e., the mass of X must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products.\n\nThe possible decay modes are into fermion-antifermion pairs. The options given are various quark pairs and lepton pairs.\n\nFirst, let's recall the masses of the fermions involved. I need to remember approximate masses of quarks and leptons. Let me jot them down:\n\nQuarks (in GeV/c², roughly):\n\n- Up (u): ~2.3 MeV\n- Down (d): ~4.8 MeV\n- Strange (s): ~96 MeV\n- Charm (c): ~1.28 GeV\n- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV\n- Top (t): ~173 GeV\n\nLeptons (in GeV/c²):\n\n- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV\n- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV\n- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV\n\nNote: These are approximate values and can vary slightly depending on the source, but these should be close enough for this problem.\n\nNow, since X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of X (6 GeV) needs to be greater than twice the mass of the fermion (since each fermion and antifermion need to have at least their rest mass energy). Let's check for each possible decay:\n\nFor quark pairs:\n\n- uū: 2 * 2.3 MeV ≈ 4.6 MeV < 6 GeV → allowed\n- d̄d: same as uū, allowed\n- s̄s: 2 * 96 MeV ≈ 192 MeV = 0.192 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed\n- c̄c: 2 * 1.28 GeV ≈ 2.56 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed\n- b̄b: 2 * 4.7 GeV ≈ 9.4 GeV. Wait, X is only 6 GeV, so 9.4 GeV is more than 6 GeV. Therefore, X cannot decay into b quarks because the combined mass is larger than X's mass. So this decay is not allowed.\n- t̄t: 2 * 173 GeV ≈ 346 GeV, way too heavy, obviously not allowed.\n\nLepton pairs:\n\n- e⁺e⁻: 2 * 0.511 MeV ≈ 1.02 MeV < 6 GeV → allowed\n- μ⁺μ⁻: 2 * 105.7 MeV ≈ 211 MeV = 0.211 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed\n- τ⁺τ⁻: 2 * 1.777 GeV ≈ 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed\n\nSo, possible allowed decays are:\n\n- uū, d̄d, s̄s, c̄c, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻, τ⁺τ⁻\n\nBut not b̄b or t̄t.\n\nNow let's look at the options given:\n\nOption A: X → b̄b, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, e⁺e⁻\n\nBut we saw that b̄b is not allowed because 2*4.7 GeV = 9.4 GeV > 6 GeV. So A includes b̄b which is forbidden. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: X → c̄c, s̄s, uū, d̄d, t̄t, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻\n\nHere, t̄t is included, which is forbidden (needs 346 GeV). So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: X → c̄c, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻\n\nThis includes all the allowed ones except b̄b and t̄t and μ⁺μ⁻? Wait, no, μ⁺μ⁻ is included here. Wait, let me check:\n\nOption C includes c̄c, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. All of these are allowed. And it doesn't include b̄b or t̄t. So this looks correct.\n\nOption D: X → b̄b, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻\n\nThis includes b̄b which is forbidden. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The options:\n\nOption C: c̄c, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. All of these are allowed. Yes, because:\n\n- c̄c: 2.56 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- s̄s: 0.192 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- uū, d̄d: allowed\n- τ⁺τ⁻: 3.55 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- μ⁺μ⁻: 0.211 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- e⁺e⁻: allowed\n\nNo forbidden decays here. So option C is correct.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The problem lists options A, B, C, D. Let me confirm once more.\n\nOption C includes c̄c, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. All allowed. So yes.\n\nBut wait, why isn't charm included in some options? Let me check the options again.\n\nOriginal options:\n\nA: b̄b, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, e⁺e⁻ (missing μ and c? No, A includes b̄b which is wrong)\n\nB: c̄c, s̄s, uū, d̄d, t̄t, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻ (includes t̄t which is wrong)\n\nC: c̄c, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻ (all correct)\n\nD: b̄b, s̄s, uū, d̄d, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻ (includes b̄b which is wrong)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other constraints. For example, is there a possibility that some decays are forbidden by other conservation laws? Like, for example, lepton or baryon number?\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian given is a scalar coupling, so when X decays, it would produce a fermion and antifermion, which conserves both baryon and lepton numbers. For example, decaying into quark-antiquark pairs conserves baryon number (each quark is 1/3, antiquark -1/3, total 0). Similarly, leptons: τ⁺τ⁻ conserves lepton number. So there are no issues with conservation laws here. So the only constraint is kinematics.\n\nTherefore, the only allowed decays are those where the total mass of the decay products is less than 6 GeV. As we saw, this excludes b̄b, t̄t. Also, the muon pair is allowed since 0.211 GeV is much less than 6 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>"}
