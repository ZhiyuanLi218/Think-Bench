Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from algebra that dividing polynomials can be done using long division or synthetic division. Maybe I should try synthetic division since it might be faster? But wait, synthetic division works best when the divisor is of the form $ x - c $, right? Here the divisor is $ x + 1 $, which can be rewritten as $ x - (-1) $. So maybe synthetic division is still applicable here with $ c = -1 $. Let me confirm that. Yes, synthetic division can be used when the divisor is linear, regardless of the sign. So I can use synthetic division with -1 as the value.\n\nAlright, let me set up the synthetic division. First, I need to write down the coefficients of the dividend, which is $ x^6 - 3 $. But wait, the dividend is $ x^6 - 3 $, which is a 6th-degree polynomial. However, the coefficients for the missing terms (like $ x^5 $, $ x^4 $, etc.) will be zero. So the coefficients should be: 1 (for $ x^6 $), 0 (for $ x^5 $), 0 (for $ x^4 $), 0 (for $ x^3 $), 0 (for $ x^2 $), 0 (for $ x $), and -3 (constant term). Let me write that down:\n\nCoefficients: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3\n\nDivisor: $ x + 1 $, so c = -1.\n\nNow, setting up synthetic division:\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n     ---------------------------\n     \n\nNow, I need to bring down the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n     ---------------------------\n      1\n\nNext, multiply -1 by 1 and write the result under the next coefficient (which is 0):\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n      -1\n     ---------------------------\n      1  -1\n\nNow, add the numbers in the second column: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n      -1\n     ---------------------------\n      1  -1\n\nMultiply -1 by -1 to get 1, and place it under the next coefficient (which is 0):\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n      -1   1\n     ---------------------------\n      1  -1   1\n\nAdd the numbers in the third column: 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nNow multiply -1 by 1 to get -1, place under the next 0:\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n      -1   1  -1\n     ---------------------------\n      1  -1   1  -1\n\nAdd the numbers in the fourth column: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1 to get 1, place under the next 0:\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n      -1   1  -1   1\n     ---------------------------\n      1  -1   1  -1   1\n\nAdd the numbers in the fifth column: 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nMultiply -1 by 1 to get -1, place under the next 0:\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n      -1   1  -1   1   -1\n     ---------------------------\n      1  -1   1  -1   1   -1\n\nAdd the numbers in the sixth column: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1 to get 1, place under the last term (-3):\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n      -1   1  -1   1   -1   1\n     ---------------------------\n      1  -1   1  -1   1   -1   -2\n\nNow, the last addition in the last column is -3 + 1 = -2. This is the remainder. Since we're dividing by a linear term, the remainder should be a constant. Therefore, the quotient polynomial will be of degree 5, with coefficients 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and the remainder is -2.\n\nBut the question asks for the quotient, not the remainder. So the quotient is:\n\n$ x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 $ with a remainder of -2. However, since we're just asked for the quotient, we can ignore the remainder? Wait, no. Wait, if we are dividing $ x^6 - 3 $ by $ x + 1 $, then the division would be:\n\n$ x^6 - 3 = (x + 1) \\times Q(x) + R $, where Q(x) is the quotient and R is the remainder. Since the question says \"find the quotient when...\", I think they just want Q(x), regardless of the remainder. So even though there is a remainder, the quotient is still the polynomial part. Therefore, the answer is $ x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 $.\n\nBut let me verify this. Let me multiply $ x + 1 $ by the quotient and see if adding the remainder gives me back the original polynomial.\n\nLet me compute $ (x + 1)(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1) + (-2) $.\n\nFirst, multiply $ x + 1 $ with the quotient:\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, multiply $ x $ by each term in the quotient:\n\n$ x \\times x^5 = x^6 $\n\n$ x \\times (-x^4) = -x^5 $\n\n$ x \\times x^3 = x^4 $\n\n$ x \\times (-x^2) = -x^3 $\n\n$ x \\times x = x^2 $\n\n$ x \\times (-1) = -x $\n\nNow multiply 1 by each term in the quotient:\n\n$ 1 \\times x^5 = x^5 $\n\n$ 1 \\times (-x^4) = -x^4 $\n\n$ 1 \\times x^3 = x^3 $\n\n$ 1 \\times (-x^2) = -x^2 $\n\n$ 1 \\times x = x $\n\n$ 1 \\times (-1) = -1 $\n\nNow add all these together:\n\nStart with $ x^6 $\n\nThen for $ -x^5 + x^5 = 0 $\n\nThen $ x^4 - x^4 = 0 $\n\nThen $ -x^3 + x^3 = 0 $\n\nThen $ x^2 - x^2 = 0 $\n\nThen $ -x + x = 0 $\n\nAnd then the constant term is -1.\n\nSo altogether, the product is $ x^6 - 1 $. Then adding the remainder -2 gives:\n\n$ x^6 - 1 + (-2) = x^6 - 3 $, which is the original dividend. Perfect! So that checks out. Therefore, the quotient is indeed $ x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 $.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is by using polynomial long division. Let me try that as a cross-check to ensure I didn't make a mistake with synthetic division.\n\nSo, dividing $ x^6 - 3 $ by $ x + 1 $.\n\nSet up the division:\n\nDividend: $ x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 $\n\nDivisor: $ x + 1 $\n\nStart by dividing the leading term $ x^6 $ by $ x $, which gives $ x^5 $. This is the first term of the quotient.\n\nMultiply the divisor $ x + 1 $ by $ x^5 $: $ x^5 \\times x + x^5 \\times 1 = x^6 + x^5 $.\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n$ (x^6 + 0x^5 + ...) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 $.\n\nBring down the terms, but since we already have them written, it's just -x^5 + ... Next term is -x^5 divided by x, which is -x^4. Add that to the quotient.\n\nMultiply divisor by -x^4: $ -x^4 \\times x + -x^4 \\times 1 = -x^5 - x^4 $.\n\nSubtract this from the current dividend:\n\n$ (-x^5 + 0x^4 + ...) - (-x^5 - x^4) = (-x^5 + 0x^4) + x^5 + x^4 = 0x^5 + x^4 + ... $.\n\nSo now we have x^4 + 0x^3 + ... Next term is x^4 divided by x, which is x^3. Add to quotient.\n\nMultiply divisor by x^3: $ x^3 \\times x + x^3 \\times 1 = x^4 + x^3 $.\n\nSubtract this from current dividend:\n\n$ (x^4 + 0x^3 + ...) - (x^4 + x^3) = -x^3 + ... $.\n\nNext term is -x^3 divided by x is -x^2. Add to quotient.\n\nMultiply divisor by -x^2: -x^3 -x^2.\n\nSubtract: (-x^3 + 0x^2 + ...) - (-x^3 -x^2) = 0x^3 + x^2 + ... \n\nNext term is x^2 divided by x is x. Add to quotient.\n\nMultiply divisor by x: x^2 + x.\n\nSubtract: (x^2 + 0x + ...) - (x^2 + x) = -x + ... \n\nNext term is -x divided by x is -1. Add to quotient.\n\nMultiply divisor by -1: -x -1.\n\nSubtract: (-x - 3) - (-x -1) = -x -3 + x +1 = -2. Which is the remainder.\n\nSo the quotient is $ x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 $, same as before, and remainder -2. Perfect, so this confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this? For example, using the Remainder Factor Theorem? Well, the Remainder Factor Theorem tells us that the remainder when a polynomial f(x) is divided by x - c is f(c). In our case, the divisor is x + 1, which is x - (-1), so the remainder is f(-1). Let me compute that.\n\nGiven f(x) = x^6 - 3. Then f(-1) = (-1)^6 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2. Which matches the remainder we found earlier. However, this only gives the remainder, not the quotient. So that doesn't help us find the quotient directly, but it's a good check.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps using the formula for dividing polynomials. If we know that f(x) = (x + 1) * Q(x) + R, and we found R = -2, then Q(x) = (f(x) - R)/(x + 1) = (x^6 - 3 - (-2))/(x + 1) = (x^6 - 1)/(x + 1). Wait, but x^6 - 1 is a difference of squares? Or difference of cubes?\n\nWait, x^6 - 1 can be factored. Let me recall that x^n - 1 factors as (x - 1)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + ... + x + 1). But here we have x^6 - 1, which can be factored as (x^3)^2 - 1^2 = (x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1). Then each of those can be factored further: x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) and x^3 + 1 = (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1). Therefore, x^6 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1). Therefore, if we divide x^6 - 1 by x + 1, we get (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1). Let me multiply that out to see if it equals the quotient we found earlier.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. However, since we have f(x) - R = x^6 - 1, and we know that dividing this by x + 1 gives us Q(x). So Q(x) = (x^6 - 1)/(x + 1). If we can compute this, maybe it's simpler?\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series? Because x^6 - 1 divided by x + 1... Wait, x^6 - 1 divided by x - 1 is x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1. But here we are dividing by x + 1. Is there a similar formula?\n\nYes, in general, x^n - a^n can be factored as (x - a)(x^{n-1} + a x^{n-2} + a^2 x^{n-3} + ... + a^{n-1}).\n\nBut here, we have x^6 - (-1)^6, since x^6 - 1 = x^6 - (-1)^6 (since (-1)^6 = 1). Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, x^6 - (-1)^something?\n\nWait, if we think of x^6 - (-1)^something. Let me see. Let me consider that x^6 - 1 divided by x + 1. Let me write x^6 - 1 as (x^3)^2 - 1^2 = (x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1) as before. Then divide by x + 1. Since x^3 + 1 factors as (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1). Therefore, x^6 - 1 divided by x + 1 is (x^3 - 1)(x^2 - x + 1). Then x^3 - 1 factors further as (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1). Therefore, the full factorization is (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1). But if we just want to perform the division, maybe we can perform polynomial division on x^6 - 1 divided by x + 1.\n\nAlternatively, note that x^6 - 1 divided by x + 1 can be considered as evaluating the sum x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1, which is what we found earlier. Let me check by multiplying (x + 1)(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1) = x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1. Combine like terms:\n\nx^6 + (-x^5 + x^5) + (x^4 - x^4) + (-x^3 + x^3) + (x^2 - x^2) + (-x + x) - 1 = x^6 - 1. Perfect. Therefore, Q(x) = x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1. Therefore, this confirms our result again.\n\nSo whether I use synthetic division, polynomial long division, or factoring, I get the same quotient. Therefore, I can be confident that the quotient when $ x^6 - 3 $ is divided by $ x + 1 $ is $ x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 $, with a remainder of -2, but since the question only asks for the quotient, that is the answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize that dividing by $ x + 1 $ can be done via synthetic division with c = -1.\n\n2. Set up synthetic division with coefficients of the dividend, remembering to include zeros for missing terms.\n\n3. Perform synthetic division step by step, keeping track of the carries and additions.\n\n4. Verify the result by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding the remainder to ensure it equals the original dividend.\n\n5. Cross-check using polynomial long division and alternative factoring methods to confirm consistency.\n\nTherefore, after multiple methods and checks, I'm confident the quotient is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe quotient is \\boxed{x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1}.\n</think>"}
