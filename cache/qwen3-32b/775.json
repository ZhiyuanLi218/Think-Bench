I need to find the value of N such that the probability of drawing two balls of the same color from each urn is 0.58. The first urn has 4 green and 6 blue balls. The second urn has 16 green and N blue balls. Hmm. \n\nFirst, let me recall that probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities if they are independent. Since the balls are drawn from different urns, I think these events are independent. So, the probability that both balls are green plus the probability that both balls are blue should equal 0.58.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(both green) + P(both blue) = 0.58\n\nCalculating each probability:\n\nFor the first urn, the probability of drawing a green ball is 4/(4+6) = 4/10. For the second urn, it's 16/(16 + N). So, the probability both are green is (4/10)*(16/(16 + N)).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing a blue ball from the first urn is 6/10. The probability of drawing a blue ball from the second urn is N/(16 + N). Therefore, the probability both are blue is (6/10)*(N/(16 + N)).\n\nAdding these two probabilities together gives 0.58. So:\n\n(4/10)*(16/(16 + N)) + (6/10)*(N/(16 + N)) = 0.58\n\nHmm. Let me write that equation more clearly:\n\n( (4 * 16) / (10*(16 + N)) ) + ( (6 * N) / (10*(16 + N)) ) = 0.58\n\nSince both terms have the same denominator, I can combine them:\n\n[ (4*16) + 6N ] / [10*(16 + N) ] = 0.58\n\nCalculating 4*16: 64. So:\n\n(64 + 6N) / [10*(16 + N)] = 0.58\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n(64 + 6N) / [10*(16 + N)] = 0.58\n\nNow, I need to solve for N. Let me cross multiply to eliminate the denominator.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 10*(16 + N):\n\n64 + 6N = 0.58 * 10 * (16 + N)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n0.58 * 10 = 5.8, so:\n\n64 + 6N = 5.8*(16 + N)\n\nLet me compute 5.8*(16 + N). Let me expand that:\n\n5.8*16 + 5.8*N\n\nCalculate 5.8*16. Let me do 5*16 = 80, 0.8*16 = 12.8, so total is 80 + 12.8 = 92.8. Therefore:\n\n64 + 6N = 92.8 + 5.8N\n\nNow, let me collect like terms. Subtract 5.8N from both sides:\n\n64 + 6N - 5.8N = 92.8\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n64 + 0.2N = 92.8\n\nNow, subtract 64 from both sides:\n\n0.2N = 92.8 - 64\n\nCalculate 92.8 - 64: 28.8\n\nTherefore:\n\n0.2N = 28.8\n\nSolving for N:\n\nN = 28.8 / 0.2 = 144\n\nWait, 28.8 divided by 0.2. Since 0.2 is 1/5, dividing by 1/5 is multiplying by 5. 28.8 * 5 = ?\n\n28 * 5 = 140, 0.8 * 5 = 4, so total is 144. So N = 144.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the probability equation:\n\nP(both same color) = P(both green) + P(both blue) = 0.58. Correct.\n\nCalculations for probabilities:\n\nFirst urn green: 4/10, second urn green: 16/(16 + N). Multiply them: 4/10 * 16/(16 + N). Correct.\n\nFirst urn blue: 6/10, second urn blue: N/(16 + N). Multiply them: 6/10 * N/(16 + N). Correct.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(64 + 6N)/[10*(16 + N)] = 0.58. Correct.\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n64 + 6N = 5.8*(16 + N). Correct, since 0.58*10 is 5.8.\n\nThen expanding 5.8*(16 + N) = 92.8 + 5.8N. Correct.\n\nSubtracting 5.8N:\n\n64 + 0.2N = 92.8. Correct.\n\nSubtract 64:\n\n0.2N = 28.8. Correct.\n\nDivide by 0.2: N = 144. That seems right.\n\nBut let me verify with N = 144.\n\nSo second urn has 16 green and 144 blue, total balls = 16 + 144 = 160.\n\nCompute P(both green): (4/10)*(16/160) = (0.4)*(0.1) = 0.04.\n\nWait, 4/10 is 0.4, 16/160 is 0.1, so 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04.\n\nP(both blue): (6/10)*(144/160) = 0.6 * (144/160). Let's calculate 144/160: divide numerator and denominator by 16: 9/10. Wait, 144 divided by 16 is 9, 160 divided by 16 is 10. So 9/10 = 0.9. Therefore, 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.54.\n\nAdding 0.04 + 0.54 = 0.58. Which matches the given probability. Therefore, N = 144 is correct.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a very large number. 144 blue balls? The first urn has only 10 balls, but the second urn has 160? Maybe, but math checks out. Let me check my calculation again for P(both green). First urn green: 4/10. Second urn green: 16/(16 + 144) = 16/160 = 1/10. So 4/10 * 1/10 = 4/100 = 0.04. Correct. Then blue: first urn blue is 6/10, second urn blue is 144/160 = 9/10. 6/10 * 9/10 = 54/100 = 0.54. Total is 0.58. Correct. Therefore, N is indeed 144. So the answer is 144. \n\nBut let me check if there is another way to approach this problem, just to confirm. Maybe using algebra differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the equation again:\n\n(64 + 6N) / [10*(16 + N)] = 0.58\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me write 0.58 as 58/100 = 29/50. Maybe fractions are easier.\n\nSo:\n\n(64 + 6N)/[10*(16 + N)] = 29/50\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n50*(64 + 6N) = 29*10*(16 + N)\n\nSimplify:\n\n50*(64 + 6N) = 290*(16 + N)\n\nCompute left side: 50*64 + 50*6N = 3200 + 300N\n\nRight side: 290*16 + 290*N\n\nCalculate 290*16: Let's do 300*16 - 10*16 = 4800 - 160 = 4640\n\nTherefore:\n\n3200 + 300N = 4640 + 290N\n\nSubtract 290N:\n\n3200 + 10N = 4640\n\nSubtract 3200:\n\n10N = 4640 - 3200 = 1440\n\nTherefore, N = 1440 / 10 = 144. Same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, N is 144. So I think that's correct. The answer is 144.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ N $ is \\boxed{144}.\n</think>"}
