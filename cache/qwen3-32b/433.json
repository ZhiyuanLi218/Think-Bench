The question is asking which liquid element is a dark-colored, nonconducting substance at room temperature. The options are mercury, bromine, iodine, and bismuth.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the physical states of these elements at room temperature. Room temperature is typically around 20-25°C. So, which of these are liquids? I remember that mercury is a metal and is liquid at room temperature. Bromine is also a liquid, I think. Iodine is a solid, right? It sublimes into a violet gas. Bismuth is a solid metal, I believe.\n\nSo, the candidates are mercury and bromine. Now, the question mentions it's a dark-colored, nonconducting substance. Let's break that down. Conductivity: mercury is a metal, so it should conduct electricity. Bromine is a nonmetal, so it's likely a nonconductor. Iodine is a nonmetal but it's a solid. So if the element is a nonconductor, then it's probably bromine.\n\nNow, color. Mercury is a shiny, silvery liquid metal. Bromine is a reddish-brown liquid. So dark-colored would fit bromine better. Mercury is more of a metallic silver, not dark. Iodine is a dark solid, but it's not a liquid at room temperature. So the answer should be bromine. Let me check again: mercury is liquid, but it's a conductor and light-colored. Bromine is liquid, nonconductor, dark-colored. Yes, that matches the description.\n</think>"}
