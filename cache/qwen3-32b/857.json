Therefore, Jupiter's orbital path is an ellipse with the Sun at a focus, not at the center.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B:**\n> *The magnitude of the orbital velocities of Mars and Jupiter around the Sun is always equal.*\n\nThis is also **incorrect**. **Kepler's Second Law** tells us that a planet's **velocity varies** as it moves along its orbit. It moves faster when it is closer to the Sun (at perihelion) and slower when it is farther (at aphelion). Furthermore, since **Mars and Jupiter have different orbital distances and periods**, their velocities cannot be equal at all times.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C:**\n> *The square of the ratio of the orbital periods of Mars and Jupiter is equal to the cube of the ratio of their semi-major axes.*\n\nThis is **correct**. **Kepler's Third Law** states that the **square of the orbital period** of a planet is proportional to the **cube of the semi-major axis** of its orbit. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_1}{a_2}\\right)^3\n$$\n\nwhere $T$ is the orbital period and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit. This directly matches the statement in option C.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D:**\n> *Within the same time frame, the area swept by the line connecting Mars and the Sun is equal to the area swept by the line connecting Jupiter and the Sun.*\n\nThis is **incorrect**. Kepler's Second Law ensures that **each planet individually** sweeps out equal areas in equal times. However, this does **not** imply that **two different planets** (e.g., Mars and Jupiter) sweep out the same area in the same time frame. Their orbital speeds and distances from the Sun differ, so the swept areas will not be equal.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final Answer:**\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about Kepler's laws of planetary motion and which statement is correct regarding Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is right based on Kepler's laws.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Kepler's three laws are. From what I remember, Kepler's first law states that planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths with the Sun at one of the two foci. So the Sun isn't at the center of the ellipse, but at a focus. That makes me think option A might be incorrect because it says the Sun is at the center of Jupiter's orbital path. Since it's an ellipse, the Sun is at a focus, not the center. So A is probably wrong.\n\nNext, option B says the magnitude of the orbital velocities of Mars and Jupiter around the Sun is always equal. Hmm. Kepler's second law is about equal areas swept in equal times, which means that a planet moves faster when it's closer to the Sun (perihelion) and slower when it's farther (aphelion). So the velocity isn't constant. But here, the option is comparing Mars and Jupiter's velocities. Since they have different orbital radii (Jupiter is much farther out than Mars), their average velocities would be different. Also, their velocities vary at different points in their orbits. So B seems incorrect because their velocities aren't always equal. So B is out.\n\nOption C states that the square of the ratio of the orbital periods of Mars and Jupiter is equal to the cube of the ratio of their semi-major axes. That rings a bell. Kepler's third law is about the relationship between the orbital period and the semi-major axis. The law is usually stated as (T1/T2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3, where T is the orbital period and a is the semi-major axis. So this seems correct. Let me check again. Yes, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So when taking the ratio of two planets, the square of the period ratio equals the cube of the semi-major axis ratio. So option C is correct. That makes me think C is the right answer.\n\nOption D: Within the same time frame, the area swept by the line connecting Mars and the Sun is equal to the area swept by the line connecting Jupiter and the Sun. Kepler's second law says that a line connecting a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. But this is per planet. So for each individual planet, the area swept is equal in equal times. However, comparing different planets (Mars and Jupiter), their swept areas in the same time frame wouldn't necessarily be equal. For example, Mars has a shorter orbital period and different distance, so the area it sweeps in a given time would be different from Jupiter's. So D is incorrect because it's comparing different planets, not the same planet's areas over the same time.\n\nSo putting it all together: A is wrong (Sun at focus, not center), B is wrong (velocities vary and differ between planets), C is correct (Kepler's third law), D is wrong (swept areas differ between planets). So the answer should be option C.\n</think>"}
