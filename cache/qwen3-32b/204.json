The problem mentions that in the S' frame, which I assume is the rest frame of the K⁰ meson, each pion is moving at 0.827c. Now, if the K⁰ is moving at 0.6c in the S frame, I need to find the maximum speed of a π meson in that frame.\n\nFirst, let me recall some concepts. When a particle decays, the decay products will have certain velocities in the rest frame of the parent particle. If the parent particle is moving relative to another frame (the lab frame, for example), then we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the velocities of the decay products in that lab frame.\n\nSo, the key here is to use the Lorentz velocity transformation equations. Since the K⁰ meson is moving at 0.6c in the S frame, the S' frame is moving at 0.6c relative to S. The pions are moving at ±0.827c in the S' frame (since they are emitted in opposite directions in the rest frame of the K⁰ to conserve momentum). Therefore, depending on the direction of the pion's velocity in the S' frame relative to the direction of the K⁰'s motion in the S frame, the velocity in the S frame will be different. To get the maximum speed, we should consider the pion that is moving in the same direction as the K⁰'s motion in the S frame. The other pion would be moving in the opposite direction in the S' frame, so its speed in the S frame would be less.\n\nTherefore, I need to apply the velocity addition formula to the pion moving in the same direction as the K⁰'s motion. Let me write down the formula.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n\nu = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )\n\nWhere:\n- u is the velocity in the S frame (lab frame)\n- u' is the velocity in the S' frame (rest frame of the K⁰)\n- v is the velocity of the S' frame relative to S (which is 0.6c here)\n- c is the speed of light\n\nSo plugging in the numbers, for the pion moving in the same direction as the K⁰'s motion, u' is +0.827c, and v is +0.6c. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me compute the numerator:\n\nu' + v = 0.827c + 0.6c = 1.427c\n\nDenominator:\n\n1 + (u' v)/c² = 1 + (0.827c * 0.6c)/c² = 1 + (0.827 * 0.6) = 1 + 0.4962 = 1.4962\n\nTherefore, u = (1.427c) / 1.4962 ≈ let me compute that division.\n\nDividing 1.427 by 1.4962. Let me approximate this. Let me note that 1.427 / 1.4962 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 1.427 / 1.4962 ≈ Let me compute 1.427 divided by approximately 1.5. 1.427 / 1.5 ≈ 0.9513. But since the denominator is slightly less than 1.5 (it's 1.4962), the actual value will be slightly higher. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLet me compute 1.427 / 1.4962.\n\nFirst, multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to remove decimals:\n\n1427 / 1496.2 ≈ ?\n\nLet me approximate this fraction. Let me divide numerator and denominator by something? Maybe approximate decimal division.\n\nAlternatively, use calculator-like steps.\n\nLet me note that 1.4962 × 0.95 = 1.4962 × 0.95 = ?\n\nWell, 1.4962 × 0.95 = 1.4962 × (1 - 0.05) = 1.4962 - 0.07481 = 1.42139\n\nCompare with numerator 1.427. The difference between 1.427 and 1.42139 is 0.00561.\n\nSo, 0.95 + (0.00561 / 1.4962). Let me compute 0.00561 / 1.4962 ≈ 0.00375.\n\nTherefore, total is approximately 0.95 + 0.00375 ≈ 0.95375.\n\nTherefore, u ≈ 0.95375c.\n\nSo approximately 0.954c.\n\nBut let me check with more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, use decimal approximations.\n\nLet me compute 1.427 / 1.4962:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nDivide 1.427 by 1.4962.\n\nLet me use the fact that 1 / 1.4962 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 1 / 1.4962 ≈ 0.6685 (since 1 / 1.5 ≈ 0.6667, so 1.4962 is slightly less than 1.5, so reciprocal is slightly more than 0.6667. Let me compute 1 / 1.4962:\n\nLet me approximate using Newton-Raphson method or something. Let me take an initial guess of x₀ = 0.668.\n\nCompute 1.4962 * 0.668 = ?\n\nWell, 1.4962 * 0.6 = 0.89772\n\n1.4962 * 0.06 = 0.089772\n\n1.4962 * 0.008 = 0.0119696\n\nAdding up: 0.89772 + 0.089772 = 0.987492 + 0.0119696 ≈ 0.9994616\n\nSo 1.4962 * 0.668 ≈ 0.99946, which is very close to 1. Therefore, 1 / 1.4962 ≈ 0.668.\n\nTherefore, 1.427 / 1.4962 ≈ 1.427 * 0.668 ≈ Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 1 * 0.668 = 0.668\n\n0.4 * 0.668 = 0.2672\n\n0.02 * 0.668 = 0.01336\n\n0.007 * 0.668 = 0.004676\n\nAdding up: 0.668 + 0.2672 = 0.9352 + 0.01336 = 0.94856 + 0.004676 ≈ 0.953236.\n\nTherefore, approximately 0.9532c. So about 0.953c.\n\nSo approximately 0.953c. Let me check with calculator steps again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can do exact fraction.\n\nBut maybe I need to carry more decimals. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe the exact value is needed?\n\nWait, but the question says \"what is the maximum possible speed of one of the π mesons?\" So they might expect an exact expression or maybe a decimal value?\n\nBut given that the initial speed is 0.827c, which is likely a precise value from the decay (probably from energy and momentum conservation in the rest frame), but since we are given that in S', the speed is 0.827c, we can take that as exact for the purposes of the problem.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with the calculation:\n\nu = (0.827c + 0.6c) / (1 + (0.827 * 0.6)) = (1.427c) / (1 + 0.4962) = 1.427c / 1.4962 ≈ 0.953c.\n\nBut let me compute 0.827 * 0.6:\n\n0.8 * 0.6 = 0.48\n\n0.027 * 0.6 = 0.0162\n\nTotal: 0.48 + 0.0162 = 0.4962. Correct.\n\nSo denominator is 1 + 0.4962 = 1.4962.\n\nSo 1.427 / 1.4962. Let me do this division more accurately.\n\nLet me write 1.427 divided by 1.4962.\n\nLet me use decimal division:\n\nLet me consider 1.427 ÷ 1.4962.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10,000 to make it easier? No, maybe decimal division.\n\nLet me note that 1.4962 goes into 1.427 how many times?\n\nSince 1.4962 is larger than 1.427, it goes 0. times. Let me add decimal places.\n\nLet me write 1.4270 divided by 1.4962.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10 to get 14.270 / 14.962.\n\nStill, 14.962 goes into 14.270 0.95... times?\n\nLet me compute 14.962 × 0.95 = ?\n\n14.962 × 0.95 = 14.962 × (1 - 0.05) = 14.962 - 0.7481 = 14.2139.\n\nSubtract that from 14.270: 14.270 - 14.2139 = 0.0561.\n\nBring down a zero (making it 0.5610). Now, how many times does 14.962 go into 0.5610? Approximately 0.0375 times (since 14.962 × 0.0375 ≈ 0.561). Therefore, total is approximately 0.95 + 0.0375 = 0.9875? Wait no, wait. Wait, we had 0.95 as the first approximation, then we have 0.0375 in the next decimal place? Wait, actually, the previous step was 14.962 × 0.95 = 14.2139, subtracted from 14.270 gives 0.0561. Then, we have 0.0561 / 14.962 ≈ 0.00375. Therefore, total is 0.95 + 0.00375 ≈ 0.95375. Therefore, 0.95375. Therefore, the value is approximately 0.9538c.\n\nSo approximately 0.954c. If I round to three decimal places, 0.954c. However, maybe I need more precise value? Let me check with calculator-like precision.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives 0.827c as the speed in S', which is three decimal places, perhaps we need to carry out the calculation with more precision?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me try to compute 1.427 / 1.4962 with more precision.\n\nLet me consider that 1.4962 × 0.953 = ?\n\nCompute 1.4962 × 0.953:\n\nFirst compute 1.4962 × 0.9 = 1.34658\n\n1.4962 × 0.05 = 0.07481\n\n1.4962 × 0.003 = 0.0044886\n\nAdding up:\n\n1.34658 + 0.07481 = 1.42139 + 0.0044886 ≈ 1.4258786\n\nCompare to numerator 1.427. The difference is 1.427 - 1.4258786 ≈ 0.0011214.\n\nTherefore, 1.4962 × 0.953 ≈ 1.42588. The numerator is 1.427, so we need to find how much more than 0.953 is needed.\n\nLet me denote x = 0.953 + δ, such that 1.4962 × x = 1.427.\n\nWe have 1.4962 × 0.953 + 1.4962 × δ = 1.427.\n\nWe know 1.4962 × 0.953 ≈ 1.42588, so:\n\n1.42588 + 1.4962 × δ = 1.427\n\nTherefore, 1.4962 × δ ≈ 1.427 - 1.42588 = 0.00112\n\nTherefore, δ ≈ 0.00112 / 1.4962 ≈ 0.000748.\n\nTherefore, total x ≈ 0.953 + 0.000748 ≈ 0.953748.\n\nTherefore, u ≈ 0.9537c, which is approximately 0.954c.\n\nTherefore, the maximum speed is approximately 0.954c. Depending on the problem's requirement, maybe we need to present it with three decimal places? Let me check if 0.9537 rounds to 0.954, yes. So 0.954c.\n\nBut let me check with exact fractions? Wait, but the given value is 0.827c, which is likely a precise number from the problem's context, but since it's given as a decimal, maybe we are supposed to carry out the calculation with decimals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different approach? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use beta (β) notation where β = v/c.\n\nLet me define β = 0.6, β' = 0.827. Then, the relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n\nβ = (β' + β) / (1 + β' β)\n\nWait no, sorry. Wait, in the formula, u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). So if I let β = u/c, β' = u'/c, and β_K = v/c (velocity of K meson). Then,\n\nβ = (β' + β_K) / (1 + β' β_K)\n\nTherefore, plugging in numbers:\n\nβ = (0.827 + 0.6) / (1 + 0.827 * 0.6) = 1.427 / (1 + 0.4962) ≈ 1.427 / 1.4962 ≈ 0.9537.\n\nTherefore, β ≈ 0.9537, so speed is ≈ 0.9537c.\n\nSo approximately 0.954c. If the problem expects an exact answer, maybe we need to carry more decimals or present it as a fraction? But since all given values are decimals, probably decimal is fine. However, maybe I made an error in assuming the direction? Let me check.\n\nIn the rest frame of the K meson (S'), the two pions are moving in opposite directions. Let me confirm that. Yes, because in the rest frame of the K meson, to conserve momentum, the two pions must have equal and opposite momenta. Assuming they have the same mass (which they do, since π+ and π- have the same mass), they must have equal and opposite velocities. Therefore, one is moving at +0.827c and the other at -0.827c in S'.\n\nTherefore, when transforming to the lab frame S, where the K meson is moving at 0.6c (let's assume along the same axis as the pion's motion in S'), then the pion moving in the same direction as the K meson will have its velocity boosted, while the one moving opposite will have its velocity reduced. Therefore, the maximum speed is indeed the one moving in the same direction.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.954c. However, let me check if I can get a more precise value.\n\nLet me compute 1.427 divided by 1.4962 with more precision. Let me use cross multiplication.\n\nLet me note that 1.4962 × 0.9537 = ?\n\nCompute 1.4962 × 0.95 = 1.42139 as before.\n\nCompute 1.4962 × 0.0037 = ?\n\nFirst, 1.4962 × 0.003 = 0.0044886\n\n1.4962 × 0.0007 = 0.00104734\n\nTotal: 0.0044886 + 0.00104734 ≈ 0.00553594\n\nTherefore, total 1.4962 × 0.9537 ≈ 1.42139 + 0.00553594 ≈ 1.42692594, which is very close to 1.427. The difference is 1.427 - 1.42692594 ≈ 0.00007406. Therefore, to get a more precise value, we can do:\n\nLet me denote that 1.4962 × 0.9537 ≈ 1.426926. The target is 1.427. The difference is +0.000074. So, how much more δ needs to be added to 0.9537 to get the remaining 0.000074?\n\nSo, 1.4962 × δ ≈ 0.000074 => δ ≈ 0.000074 / 1.4962 ≈ 4.946 × 10^-5 ≈ 0.0000495.\n\nTherefore, total β ≈ 0.9537 + 0.0000495 ≈ 0.9537495. Therefore, approximately 0.95375c. So, approximately 0.9538c. Rounded to four decimal places, 0.9538c. If we want three decimal places, it's 0.954c.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an exact fraction? Wait, but the given speed is 0.827c. Where does that come from? In reality, the kaon decays into two pions, but the exact speed depends on their masses. However, since the problem gives us that in the rest frame, each pion is moving at 0.827c, we don't need to calculate that part. So we can take 0.827c as given.\n\nTherefore, given that, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the maximum speed is approximately 0.954c.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me use the formula for relativistic addition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Lorentz transformations for velocities.\n\nThe general formula for velocity transformation is:\n\nu = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )\n\nYes, which is what I used. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use beta and gamma notation.\n\nBut no, the formula is straightforward. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.954c. Depending on the problem's required precision, maybe we need more decimals. Let me check using calculator-like computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use decimal expansion:\n\nLet me compute 1.427 / 1.4962:\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nDividend: 1.427\n\nDivisor: 1.4962\n\nLet me perform the division step by step.\n\nFirst, since 1.4962 > 1.427, we write it as 1.427.000...\n\nWe can write this as 1.427 divided by 1.4962 equals ?\n\nLet me multiply numerator and denominator by 10^4 to make it 14270 / 14962.\n\nNow perform the division 14270 ÷ 14962.\n\nSince 14962 goes into 14270 0. times. Let me compute how many times 14962 fits into 142700 (adding decimal places).\n\nWait, this might get too tedious. Alternatively, use approximation:\n\nWe know that 1 / 1.4962 ≈ 0.6685 as before.\n\nTherefore, 1.427 × 0.6685 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 1.427 × 0.6685:\n\nFirst, compute 1 × 0.6685 = 0.6685\n\n0.4 × 0.6685 = 0.2674\n\n0.02 × 0.6685 = 0.01337\n\n0.007 × 0.6685 = 0.0046795\n\nAdding up:\n\n0.6685 + 0.2674 = 0.9359 + 0.01337 = 0.94927 + 0.0046795 ≈ 0.95395.\n\nTherefore, approximately 0.954c. So that's consistent with prior results.\n\nTherefore, I think 0.954c is the correct answer here.\n\nBut let me check if there is another factor I might have missed. For example, is there a possibility that the maximum speed isn't just the one in the direction of motion? For example, could there be a relativistic effect where the speed is higher in some other direction? But no, because the maximum speed would be achieved when the pion is moving in the same direction as the K meson's motion. Because adding the velocities in the same direction gives the highest possible speed. If the pion were moving perpendicular, we would have to use the velocity transformation for perpendicular directions, but that would result in a lower speed. Therefore, the maximum is indeed when they are colinear.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the maximum speed is approximately 0.954c. However, let me check with exact computation using more precise decimal values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use fractions. Let me try:\n\nLet me write 1.427 / 1.4962.\n\nBut these are decimal numbers. Alternatively, perhaps convert them to fractions? Probably messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use more precise decimal values. Let me use more decimal places for the intermediate steps.\n\nLet me take u' = 0.827c, v = 0.6c.\n\nCompute numerator: 0.827 + 0.6 = 1.427.\n\nDenominator: 1 + (0.827 × 0.6) = 1 + 0.4962 = 1.4962.\n\nSo, 1.427 / 1.4962.\n\nLet me use a calculator here. Wait, since I don't have a calculator, but I can approximate it better.\n\nLet me note that 1.4962 × 0.9537 ≈ 1.4269 as before. The difference between 1.427 and 1.4269 is 0.0001. Therefore, to get a better approximation:\n\nLet me assume that β = 0.9537 + x, such that:\n\n1.4962*(0.9537 + x) = 1.427\n\nWe have 1.4962*0.9537 + 1.4962*x = 1.427\n\nWe already calculated 1.4962*0.9537 ≈ 1.4269, so:\n\n1.4269 + 1.4962*x = 1.427\n\nTherefore, 1.4962*x ≈ 0.0001 => x ≈ 0.0001 / 1.4962 ≈ 0.0000668.\n\nTherefore, β ≈ 0.9537 + 0.0000668 ≈ 0.9537668, which is approximately 0.9538c. Therefore, 0.9538c.\n\nSo, rounding to four decimal places, 0.9538c. If we want three decimal places, it's 0.954c. If the problem expects three decimal places, then 0.954c. However, maybe the exact value is something like 0.954c. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a calculation mistake. Let me verify once again:\n\nGiven u' = 0.827c, v = 0.6c.\n\nCompute u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )\n\nPlugging in:\n\nu = (0.827c + 0.6c) / [1 + (0.827 * 0.6)(c²/c²)] = (1.427c) / (1 + 0.4962) = 1.427 / 1.4962 c ≈ 0.9538c.\n\nYes, correct. Therefore, unless there is a calculation mistake here, this should be correct. Therefore, the maximum speed is approximately 0.954c.\n\nBut to check if this is correct, let me think about the limits. For example, if the pion was moving at speed c in S', then in S frame, using velocity addition, it would still be c. Since 0.827c is less than c, the result should be less than c, which it is (≈0.954c < c). Also, if the K meson was moving at, say, 0.5c, and the pion at 0.6c in S', then the addition would be (0.6 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.3) = 1.1 / 1.3 ≈ 0.846c. Which seems reasonable. So our calculation here seems in line with that.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the maximum speed is approximately 0.954c. Depending on the problem's requirement for decimal places, maybe we need to write more decimals. But since the given value is 0.827c (three decimal places), maybe we should present three decimal places. Let me compute 1.427 / 1.4962 with more precision.\n\nLet me use the linear approximation. Let me define f(x) = 1.427 / x. We want to find f(1.4962). Let me take a point close to 1.4962 where I know the value. For example, we know that f(1.4962) ≈ 0.9538. But maybe I can use calculus?\n\nLet me take x = 1.4962, and approximate f(x) = 1.427 / x. Let me take a nearby point where I know the value. For example, at x = 1.4962, we can take a Taylor expansion around x = 1.496.\n\nBut this might not help. Alternatively, since I have already approximated it as 0.9538c, and given that in most physics problems, three decimal places are sufficient, I think 0.954c is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an exact fraction? Let me check the numbers:\n\nGiven that 0.827 is likely a precise value from the problem. However, since it is given as a decimal, perhaps we need to keep three decimal places. If I compute 1.427 / 1.4962:\n\nLet me do this division with more precise long division.\n\nLet me write 1.427 ÷ 1.4962.\n\nLet me rewrite this as 1.427000... ÷ 1.4962.\n\nSince 1.4962 × 0.9 = 1.34658\n\nSubtract that from 1.42700: 1.42700 - 1.34658 = 0.08042\n\nBring down a zero: 0.80420\n\nNow, 1.4962 × 0.05 = 0.07481\n\nSubtract that from 0.08042: 0.08042 - 0.07481 = 0.00561\n\nBring down a zero: 0.05610\n\n1.4962 × 0.003 = 0.0044886\n\nSubtract that: 0.05610 - 0.0044886 = 0.0516114\n\nBring down a zero: 0.516114\n\n1.4962 × 0.0003 = 0.00044886\n\nSubtract that: 0.516114 - 0.00044886 ≈ 0.515665\n\nThis is getting too small compared to the divisor. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach. Let me note that after the first steps, we had:\n\nTotal so far: 0.9 + 0.05 + 0.003 = 0.953, with a remainder of approximately 0.05156...\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent with prior calculations. Wait, no, let me retrace:\n\nWait, initial value was 1.427 divided by 1.4962.\n\nFirst step: 0.9 gives 1.34658, remainder 0.08042.\n\nSecond step: 0.05 gives 0.07481, remainder 0.08042 - 0.07481 = 0.00561.\n\nThird step: 0.003 gives 0.0044886, remainder 0.00561 - 0.0044886 = 0.0011214.\n\nThen bring down a zero: 0.011214.\n\nNow, how much is 1.4962 × x = 0.011214?\n\nApproximately x ≈ 0.011214 / 1.4962 ≈ 0.0075. Therefore, add 0.0075 to the total, making it 0.953 + 0.0075 = 0.9605? Wait no, wait. Wait, the total so far was 0.9 + 0.05 + 0.003 = 0.953, and then adding 0.0075 would make it 0.9605? No, no, because each step is adding to the decimal places. Wait, after 0.953, the next value is 0.0075 in the next decimal place? Wait, no, let me think.\n\nActually, after the first three steps, we had 0.9 + 0.05 + 0.003 = 0.953, and then the remainder is 0.0011214. Then bringing down a zero makes it 0.011214. Now, how many times does 1.4962 go into 0.011214? It's approximately 0.0075 times. So we add 0.0075 to the current quotient, making the total quotient ≈ 0.953 + 0.0075 = 0.9605? No, no, because we are in the division process. Wait, no. Wait, the quotient is being built step by step. After the first 0.9, then adding 0.05, then 0.003, and now adding 0.000075 or something?\n\nWait, perhaps my long division approach is getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nLet me consider that after the decimal:\n\nWe have 1.427 divided by 1.4962.\n\nLet me write this as 1.427000... / 1.4962 = ?\n\nLet me adjust the decimal places so that the divisor is 1.4962 and the dividend is 1.427000...\n\nSince 1.4962 goes into 1.427 about 0.95 times, as established.\n\nLet me write it as 0.95...\n\nMultiply 1.4962 by 0.95 = 1.42139, as before.\n\nSubtract that from 1.42700: 1.42700 - 1.42139 = 0.00561.\n\nNow, bring down a zero: 0.05610.\n\nNow, how many times does 1.4962 go into 0.05610? Approximately 0.0375 times (since 1.4962 * 0.0375 ≈ 0.0553575). So, we add 0.0375 to the quotient, making it 0.95 + 0.0375 = 0.9875? No, no, because we are dealing with decimal places. Wait, the previous quotient was 0.95, and now we're adding 0.0375 in the next decimal places? No, actually, after the decimal, we have 0.95, and then we're dealing with the next decimal places.\n\nActually, after subtracting and bringing down a zero, we have 0.05610, which is five decimal places? No, let me clarify:\n\nOriginal dividend: 1.427000...\n\nAfter subtracting 1.42139, we have remainder 0.00561, then bringing down a zero gives 0.05610. So this is 0.05610, which is five decimal places? No, let me think in terms of decimal positions.\n\nThe original division is:\n\nDividend: 1.427000...\n\nDivisor: 1.4962\n\nAfter the first step (quotient 0.9), remainder 0.08042.\n\nThen adding 0.05 to the quotient (total 0.95), remainder 0.00561.\n\nThen bringing down a zero: 0.05610.\n\nNow, how many times does 1.4962 go into 0.05610? It goes approximately 0.0375 times, as before. So we add 0.0375 to the quotient, making the total quotient 0.95 + 0.0375 = 0.9875? No, no! Wait, no. The quotient is built incrementally. After the first 0.9, then we added 0.05, making it 0.95. Now, we are adding 0.00375? Wait, no, because the remainder is 0.05610, which is in the third decimal place?\n\nThis is getting too confusing without actually writing it down. Given that previous approximations have given me around 0.9537 to 0.9538, and knowing that the exact value is approximately 0.9538c, I think it's safe to go with 0.954c as the answer, especially since in most physics problems, three decimal places are standard.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible speed of one of the π mesons is approximately 0.954 times the speed of light.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check with another example. Suppose u' = c, then u should be c. Let me test the formula:\n\nu = (c + v)/(1 + v/c) = [c + v]/[(c + v)/c] = c. Correct. So the formula works for u' = c.\n\nAnother test case: if v = 0, then u = u', which is correct.\n\nIf u' = 0, then u = v, which is also correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula is working. Therefore, applying it to u' = 0.827c and v = 0.6c is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the maximum speed is approximately 0.954c.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum possible speed of one of the $ \\pi $ mesons is \\boxed{0.954c}.\n</think>"}
