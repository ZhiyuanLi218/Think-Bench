Let me start by writing down the equation and then count the atoms on each side. \n\nFirst, let's list out the elements involved. On the left side, we have Strontium (Sr), Sulfur (S), Oxygen (O), and on the right side, we also have Sr, S, and O. The O2 is a diatomic molecule, so that's just oxygen. \n\nLet me write the unbalanced equation again:\n\nSrSO4 + O2 → SrO + Sr2(SO4)3\n\nNow, let me count each element on both sides. \n\nLeft side:\n- Sr: 1 (from SrSO4)\n- S: 1 (from SrSO4)\n- O: 4 (from SrSO4) + 2 (from O2) = 6\n- O2 is separate, so total O is 4 + 2 = 6? Wait, actually, when I count oxygen, I need to be careful. The SrSO4 has 4 oxygen atoms, and O2 has 2. So total oxygen on the left is 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nRight side:\n- SrO: 1 Sr and 1 O\n- Sr2(SO4)3: Let's break that down. Sr2 means 2 Sr atoms. Then (SO4)3 means 3 sulfates. Each sulfate has 1 S and 4 O. So 3 sulfates would have 3 S and 12 O. So Sr2(SO4)3 has 2 Sr, 3 S, and 12 O.\n\nSo total right side:\n- Sr: 1 (from SrO) + 2 (from Sr2(SO4)3) = 3 Sr\n- S: 3 (from Sr2(SO4)3)\n- O: 1 (from SrO) + 12 (from Sr2(SO4)3) = 13 O\n\nLeft side:\n- Sr: 1\n- S: 1\n- O: 6\n\nSo the right side has more Sr, S, and O. Let me see how to balance this.\n\nLet me start with Sr. On the left, there's 1 Sr in SrSO4. On the right, there's 1 Sr in SrO and 2 Sr in Sr2(SO4)3, totaling 3 Sr. So to balance Sr, maybe I need 3 SrSO4 on the left? Let me try that.\n\nLet me put a coefficient of 3 in front of SrSO4:\n\n3 SrSO4 + O2 → SrO + Sr2(SO4)3\n\nNow, let's count Sr again. Left side: 3 Sr. Right side: 1 + 2 = 3. Good, Sr is balanced now.\n\nNext, sulfur (S). Left side: 3 S (from 3 SrSO4). Right side: 3 S (from Sr2(SO4)3). So sulfur is balanced.\n\nNow oxygen. Let's check. Left side: Each SrSO4 has 4 O, so 3 * 4 = 12 O from SrSO4. Plus O2 which is 2 O. Total O on left: 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nRight side: SrO has 1 O, and Sr2(SO4)3 has 12 O. Total O: 1 + 12 = 13. So left has 14 O, right has 13. Not balanced. So need to adjust O2 and maybe other coefficients.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to adjust other coefficients as well. Let me see. Also, the SrO on the right side is only 1. Since we have 3 Sr on the left, maybe we need more SrO? Let me think. Wait, the Sr is already balanced with 3 Sr on both sides. But SrO is only 1 on the right. So perhaps there's more SrO? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the right side has SrO and Sr2(SO4)3. So total Sr is 1 (from SrO) + 2 (from Sr2(SO4)3) = 3. So if we have 3 SrSO4 on the left, that's 3 Sr, which matches. So Sr is balanced. But oxygen is not. Let's see. Maybe I need to adjust the coefficient of SrO? Let me try putting a coefficient in front of SrO. Suppose I put 3 in front of SrO? Wait, but that would add more Sr. Let me think.\n\nWait, the right side has SrO and Sr2(SO4)3. Let me denote coefficients as follows:\n\nLet me assign variables. Let me let a be the coefficient for SrSO4, b for O2, c for SrO, and d for Sr2(SO4)3. Then:\n\nFor Sr: a = c + 2d\nFor S: a = 3d\nFor O: 4a + 2b = c + 12d\nFor O in SrO and Sr2(SO4)3: as above.\n\nAlso, the oxygen from O2 is 2b.\n\nLet me try solving these equations.\n\nFrom S: a = 3d. Let me set d = 1, then a = 3. Let's see.\n\nIf d = 1, then a = 3.\n\nFrom Sr: a = c + 2d → 3 = c + 2(1) → c = 1. So c = 1.\n\nNow O equation: 4a + 2b = c + 12d → 4*3 + 2b = 1 + 12*1 → 12 + 2b = 13 → 2b = 1 → b = 0.5. Hmm, fractional coefficient. Maybe we can multiply all coefficients by 2 to eliminate the fraction.\n\nSo if we multiply all coefficients by 2:\n\na = 6, d = 2, c = 2, b = 1.\n\nLet me check:\n\nSr: a = 6, c + 2d = 2 + 2*2 = 6. Good.\n\nS: a = 6, 3d = 3*2 = 6. Good.\n\nO: 4a + 2b = 4*6 + 2*1 = 24 + 2 = 26.\n\nOn the right: c + 12d = 2 + 12*2 = 2 + 24 = 26. Perfect, balanced.\n\nSo the balanced equation would be:\n\n6 SrSO4 + 1 O2 → 2 SrO + 2 Sr2(SO4)3\n\nBut let me check the coefficients again. Let me write it out:\n\n6 SrSO4 + O2 → 2 SrO + 2 Sr2(SO4)3\n\nLet me verify each element:\n\nStrontium (Sr):\n\nLeft: 6 (from 6 SrSO4)\n\nRight: 2 (from 2 SrO) + 4 (from 2 Sr2(SO4)3) = 2 + 4 = 6. Good.\n\nSulfur (S):\n\nLeft: 6 (from 6 SrSO4)\n\nRight: 6 (from 2 Sr2(SO4)3, since each has 3 S, so 2*3=6). Good.\n\nOxygen (O):\n\nLeft: 6*4 (from SrSO4) + 2 (from O2) = 24 + 2 = 26.\n\nRight: 2*1 (from SrO) + 2*12 (from Sr2(SO4)3) = 2 + 24 = 26. Good.\n\nSo all elements are balanced. Therefore, the balanced equation is 6 SrSO4 + O2 → 2 SrO + 2 Sr2(SO4)3. \n\nBut let me check if there is a simpler set of coefficients. For example, can we divide all coefficients by something? Let's see:\n\n6, 1, 2, 2. The coefficients are 6, 1, 2, 2. The greatest common divisor is 1, so this is the simplest form. So the balanced equation is:\n\n6 SrSO4 + O2 → 2 SrO + 2 Sr2(SO4)3\n\nBut maybe there's another way. Let me try another approach just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with SrO. Suppose I let the coefficient for SrO be 1. Then since Sr is 1 on the right, and from SrSO4 on the left, which is 1 Sr. But then the Sr in Sr2(SO4)3 would be 2, so total Sr on right would be 1 + 2 = 3. So need 3 SrSO4 on the left. Then proceed as before. Which is what I did earlier. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different set of coefficients? Let me see. Suppose I set d = 1, then a = 3, c = 1, and b = 0.5. But fractional coefficients are not preferred, so multiplying by 2 gives the same as before. So yes, the balanced equation is 6 SrSO4 + O2 → 2 SrO + 2 Sr2(SO4)3.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a way to have smaller coefficients. For example, if I let d = 1, then a = 3, c = 1, and b = 0.5. If I can find another way to balance without fractions. Maybe adjust O2?\n\nBut with the current approach, it seems that 0.5 O2 is needed. So doubling all gives us 6, 1, 2, 2. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal unbalanced equation:\n\nSrSO4 + O2 → SrO + Sr2(SO4)3\n\nBalanced:\n\n6 SrSO4 + O2 → 2 SrO + 2 Sr2(SO4)3\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me count once more:\n\nLeft side:\n\nSr: 6 (from 6 SrSO4)\n\nS: 6 (from 6 SrSO4)\n\nO: 6*4 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nRight side:\n\nSr: 2 (from 2 SrO) + 4 (from 2 Sr2(SO4)3) = 6\n\nS: 2*3 = 6 (from 2 Sr2(SO4)3)\n\nO: 2*1 + 2*12 = 2 + 24 = 26\n\nAll elements balanced. So the answer is 6 SrSO4 + O2 → 2 SrO + 2 Sr2(SO4)3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to balance it? Let me try another approach. Let me look at the oxygen. The problem is that the O2 is diatomic. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nBut I think the method I used is standard. Assign variables, solve equations. Since the equations led to fractional coefficients which we can eliminate by multiplying, the result is correct. Therefore, the balanced equation is as above.\n</think>"}
