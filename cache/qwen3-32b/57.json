The formula is C4H9NO2. The options are A to D. The 1H NMR has a triplet, quartet, and singlet. Also, the mass spec has peaks at m/z 30 and 58.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each structure and see which one fits the NMR and mass spec data. Let's start with the NMR. The triplet and quartet usually indicate a CH3-CH2- group, which gives a triplet (from the CH3 next to CH2) and a quartet (from the CH2 next to CH3). The singlet could be a CH3 group that's not adjacent to any other protons, like in a methyl ester or something. Also, the exchangeable proton (like NH) is not seen, so maybe the NH is not a proton that's active in the NMR.\n\nNow, looking at the structures:\n\nOption A: CH3CH2NHCOOCH3. Let's break it down. The structure would be ethyl group (CH3CH2-) attached to NHCOOCH3. The ester part is NHCOOCH3. So the protons: the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would give a triplet (CH3) and a quartet (CH2). The methyl on the ester (OCH3) would be a singlet. That matches the NMR: triplet, quartet, singlet. So that seems possible.\n\nOption B: CH3OCH2CONHCH3. This is a methyl group attached to an OCH2CONHCH3. The ethyl group here is part of the OCH2-... The ethyl part would be OCH2-CH2? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the formula is C4H9NO2. Let me count the carbons. For option B: CH3OCH2CONHCH3. That's OCH2CONHCH3 with a methyl on the oxygen. So the carbons would be: OCH2 (2 carbons), CONH (1 carbon?), but the CONH part is part of the amide. Wait, the formula for option B is CH3OCH2CONHCH3. So the carbons: CH3O (methyl and oxygen), then CH2 (another carbon), then CONH (the carbonyl carbon is part of the CONH group), and then another CH3. Wait, maybe the total carbons are: CH3O (1) + CH2 (1) + CO (1) + NHCH3 (another 1?), so total 4 carbons? Let me count again. The structure is CH3-O-CH2-C(=O)-NH-CH3. So that's 4 carbons: CH3 (1), OCH2 (2), CO (3), and NHCH3 (4th carbon? No, the NHCH3 is a methyl group attached to NH. So the carbons are: 1 from CH3O, 1 from CH2, 1 from CO, and 1 from the NHCH3. So total 4 carbons. But the formula is C4H9NO2. Let me check the formula for option B. The formula for CH3OCH2CONHCH3 would be C3H7O2NHCH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me write it properly. The formula for option B is C4H9NO2. Let me count the elements. For CH3OCH2CONHCH3: Carbon: 3 (from CH3O) + 1 (from CH2) + 1 (from CO) + 1 (from NHCH3)? Wait, the CONH is part of the amide, so the carbonyl carbon is one. The rest: the CH3O is 1 carbon (CH3) attached to O, then CH2 (another carbon), then CO (third carbon), and the NHCH3 is another carbon. So total 4 carbons. Hydrogens: CH3O has 3 H, CH2 has 2 H, CO has no H, NH has no H, and CH3 has 3 H. But the formula is C4H9NO2. Let me count the hydrogens. The structure is CH3-O-CH2-C(=O)-NH-CH3. The hydrogens: CH3 has 3, CH2 has 2, the NH has 2 (since it's NHCH3?), and the other CH3 has 3. Wait, the NH is attached to CH3, so the NH would have one H (since it's NH-CH3, so the NH would have one H if it's NH2, but here it's NH-CH3. So the NH would have one H? Or maybe no H? Wait, the formula is C4H9NO2. Let me count the H in option B. The structure is CH3-O-CH2-C(=O)-NH-CH3. The H's: CH3 (3 H), CH2 (2 H), the NH group (probably 1 H if it's NH-CH3), and the other CH3 (3 H). So total H: 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 9 H. Which matches the formula C4H9NO2. So the formula is correct for option B. Now, the NMR. The protons would be: the CH3O (methyl) would be a singlet? Wait, the CH3O is attached to an oxygen. If it's CH3-O-CH2..., then the CH3O would be adjacent to the CH2. Wait, the structure is CH3-O-CH2-C(=O)-NH-CH3. The protons here would be:\n\n1. The CH3O group: attached to O, so it's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. The CH3O would have 3 H's, which are adjacent to a CH2 (the CH2OCH3). So the CH3O would be a quartet (since it's adjacent to a CH2, which has 2 H's), but wait, the splitting depends on the neighbors. The CH3O is attached to O-CH2-, so the CH3O is next to a CH2. So the CH3O would be split by the CH2 (2 H's), so it would be a triplet (n+1 where n=2). Wait, no, the splitting is based on the number of adjacent protons. The CH3O is adjacent to the CH2, so the CH3O protons are split by the 2 protons of the CH2. So the CH3O would be a triplet (n+1=2+1=3). But the CH2 is adjacent to the CH3O and the CO group. The CH2 is between CH3O and CO-NH-CH3. The CH2 has 2 H's. It's adjacent to the CH3O (3 H's) and the CO group. The CO group doesn't have H's, so the CH2 would be split by the 3 H's of the CH3O, so it would be a quartet (n+1=3+1=4). Then, the NH-CH3 group: the CH3 has 3 H's, adjacent to the NH group. But the NH has no protons (since the NH is attached to the CO and CH3). So the CH3 would be a singlet. So the NMR would have a triplet (from CH3O), a quartet (from CH2), and a singlet (from CH3). That matches the observed NMR: triplet, quartet, singlet. So option B also fits the NMR data.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the exchangeable hydrogen (NH) is not observed. In option B, the NH is present but not seen in the NMR. So that's okay. So both options A and B could fit the NMR data. Let's check the other options.\n\nOption C: CH3NHCOOCH2CH3. The structure would be CH3-NH-CO-O-CH2CH3. The formula is C4H9NO2. Let's check the NMR. The protons here would be:\n\n1. The CH3 attached to NH: adjacent to NH. The NH has no H's (since it's NH-), so the CH3 would be a singlet. \n\n2. The ester part: OCH2CH3. The CH2CH3 would give a triplet (CH3) and a quartet (CH2). So the NMR would have a singlet (from CH3-NH), a triplet (from CH2CH3), and a quartet (from CH2). That would be a triplet, quartet, and singlet. So the same as before. So option C also fits the NMR data.\n\nOption D: CH3CH2OCH2CONH2. Wait, the formula here would be C4H9NO2? Let me check. The structure is CH3CH2OCH2CONH2. Let's count the elements. Carbon: CH3CH2OCH2CONH2. The carbons are: 2 from CH3CH2, 1 from OCH2, 1 from CO, and 1 from CONH2? Wait, the CONH2 is part of the amide. So total carbons: 2 (CH3CH2) + 1 (OCH2) + 1 (CO) = 4. The formula would be C4H... Let me count the H. CH3CH2 has 3+2=5 H. OCH2 has 2 H. CONH2 has no H? Wait, the CONH2 would have two H's on the NH2. So total H: 5 (from CH3CH2) + 2 (from OCH2) + 2 (from NH2) = 9 H. So formula is C4H9NO2. Now, the NMR. The protons would be:\n\n1. The CH3CH2OCH2CONH2. The CH3CH2 is ethyl group. The OCH2 is adjacent to CO. The NH2 is exchangeable but not observed. The ethyl group (CH2CH3) would give a triplet (CH3) and quartet (CH2). The OCH2 would be adjacent to CO, so the OCH2 has 2 H's, adjacent to CO (no H's) and the ethyl group. Wait, the OCH2 is between the ethyl group and CO. So the OCH2 is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2 (which has 2 H's). So the OCH2 would be split by the CH2 (2 H's), so a triplet. The ethyl group's CH2CH3 would give a quartet (CH2) and triplet (CH3). Wait, but the problem states three signals: triplet, quartet, singlet. Here, the OCH2 would be a triplet, the ethyl group's CH2 would be a quartet (split by CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet (split by CH2). But that would give two triplets and a quartet. However, the problem says three signals: triplet, quartet, singlet. So maybe the OCH2 is part of the quartet? Wait, maybe the OCH2 is adjacent to the ethyl group. Let me think again. The structure is CH3CH2-O-CH2-C(=O)-NH2. The protons:\n\n- The ethyl group (CH3CH2): CH2CH3. The CH3 is adjacent to CH2, so triplet. The CH2 is adjacent to CH3 and OCH2. Wait, the CH2 is between CH3 and OCH2. So the CH2 (from ethyl) has 2 H's adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and OCH2 (2 H's). But splitting is based on the number of adjacent protons. The CH2 (from ethyl) is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's), so it would split into a quartet. The OCH2 is adjacent to the CH2 (from ethyl) and the CO. The OCH2 has 2 H's adjacent to CH2 (2 H's), so it would split into a triplet (n+1=2+1=3). The CH3 (from ethyl) is adjacent to CH2 (2 H's), so it would split into a triplet. So the NMR would have three signals: two triplets and one quartet. But the problem states a triplet, quartet, and singlet. So option D does not fit the NMR data. So D is out.\n\nNow, we're left with A, B, and C. Let's check the mass spectrometry data. The mass spec has peaks at m/z=30 and 58. Let's see what those could be.\n\nFirst, m/z=30. Common fragments with m/z=30 include CH2O (30), which is formaldehyde, but that's unlikely. Another possibility is CH2=O (30) but that's also formaldehyde. Alternatively, maybe a methylamine fragment? Or a fragment from the molecule. Let's think about each compound.\n\nFor option A: CH3CH2NHCOOCH3. The molecular ion would be the molecular weight. Let's calculate the molecular weight. C4H9NO2. Carbon: 4*12=48, H:9*1=9, N:14, O:2*16=32. Total: 48+9+14+32=103. So the molecular ion is m/z=103. Now, the peaks at 30 and 58. What fragments could give 30 and 58?\n\nFor m/z=30, perhaps a methylamine fragment (CH3NH2) has a molecular weight of 31. Close to 30. Maybe a fragment like CH2NH2 (30). Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3O (31) but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe a loss of a fragment leading to a peak at 30. Another possibility is the methyl group (15) but that's too low. Wait, maybe the COOH fragment? No. Let me think of the possible fragments.\n\nFor option A: The structure is CH3CH2-NH-CO-O-CH3. If it loses the ethyl group (C2H5, 29), then the remaining would be NH-CO-O-CH3, which would have a molecular weight of 103-29=74. Not 30. Alternatively, if it loses the methyl ester group (OCH3, 31), then the remaining would be CH3CH2NHCO (molecular weight 103-31=72). Not 30. Maybe a fragment like CO (28) or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the methylamine (CH3NH2) is a fragment. The molecular weight of CH3NH2 is 31. So close to 30. Maybe a loss of H? If there's a fragment like CH2NH2 (30), that's possible. How would that form? If the molecule breaks between the NH and CO, maybe. Let's see: CH3CH2NHCOOCH3. If the bond between NH and CO breaks, then you get CH3CH2NH+ and COOCH3. The COOCH3 would have a molecular weight of 75 (C2H3O3?), wait, no. Wait, COOCH3 is -COOCH3. The molecular weight of COOCH3 is 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) + 12 (CH3) + 3*1 (H) = 12 + 32 + 12 + 3 = 59. So if the fragment is CH3CH2NH+, which is C2H5NH (2*12 +5*1 +14=24+5+14=43). Not 30. Alternatively, maybe a different fragmentation. Maybe the molecule loses the ethyl group (C2H5, 29) and some other part. Not sure. Let's check another option.\n\nFor option B: CH3OCH2CONHCH3. The molecular weight is same as others, 103. The structure is CH3-O-CH2-C(=O)-NH-CH3. Possible fragments: If it loses the methyl group (CH3, 15), then the remaining would be OCH2CONHCH3, which is 103-15=88. Not 30. If it loses the OCH2 group (CH2O, 30). Wait, OCH2 has a molecular weight of 12 (CH2) + 16 (O) = 28. Close to 30. But maybe with a proton? If the fragment is OCH2+H, that's 28 +1=29. Still not 30. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3O (31) or something. Alternatively, if the molecule breaks between the CO and NH, then you get OCH2CO+ and NHCH3. The OCH2CO would be 12 (C) + 2*1 (H) + 16 (O) + 12 (C) + 16 (O) = 12+2+16+12+16=58. Oh! So if the molecule breaks between CO and NH, then you get a fragment with m/z=58. That matches the given peak at m/z=58. And the other fragment would be NHCH3 (31). But the peak at m/z=30 is close to 31. Maybe due to some loss of a proton or something. Alternatively, maybe the NHCH3 loses a proton to become 30. If NHCH3 is 31, losing a proton would give 30. So the peak at m/z=30 could be NHCH2 (30). That makes sense. So for option B, the fragmentation would give peaks at 30 and 58. That fits the mass spec data. So option B seems to fit both NMR and mass spec.\n\nFor option C: CH3NHCOOCH2CH3. The structure is CH3-NH-CO-O-CH2CH3. The molecular weight is 103. Let's see the fragmentation. If it loses the ethyl group (C2H5, 29), then the remaining would be CH3NHCOO (103-29=74). Not 30. If it loses the methyl group (CH3, 15), then the remaining would be NHCOOCH2CH3 (103-15=88). Not 30. If it breaks between NH and CO, then you get CH3NH+ and COOCH2CH3. The COOCH2CH3 has a molecular weight of 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) + 12 (CH2) + 2*1 (H) + 12 (CH3) + 3*1 (H) = 12+32+12+2+12+3=73. The CH3NH+ would be 15 (CH3) +14 (NH) = 29. Close to 30. Maybe due to some proton addition. So the peak at m/z=30 could be CH3NH+ (29) with a proton, making it 30. And the peak at m/z=58 could be the COOCH2CH3 fragment. Wait, COOCH2CH3 would be 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) + 12 (CH2) + 2*1 (H) + 12 (CH3) + 3*1 (H) = 12+32+12+2+12+3=73. Not 58. Alternatively, maybe the COOCH2CH3 loses some part. If it loses the CH2CH3 (29), then you get COO (44). Not 58. Alternatively, maybe a different fragmentation. Let me think again. If the molecule breaks between the CO and O, then you get CH3NHCO+ and OCH2CH3. The OCH2CH3 is ethyl group with O, which is 45 (C2H5O). The CH3NHCO+ would be 15 (CH3) +14 (NH) +12 (CO) + 1 (O?) Wait, no. The CO is part of the molecule. Wait, the fragment would be CH3NHCO+ which is 15 (CH3) +14 (NH) +12 (C) +16 (O) = 57. Close to 58. Maybe due to a proton addition, making it 58. So the peak at 58 could be CH3NHCO+ (57) with a proton, making it 58. And the peak at 30 could be the OCH2CH3 fragment losing some parts. Wait, the OCH2CH3 is 45. If it loses 15 (CH3), then you get 30. So OCH2CH3 losing CH3 would give OCH2 (29). Close to 30. Maybe due to a proton addition. So the peak at 30 could be OCH2+H (29+1=30). And the peak at 58 could be CH3NHCO+ (57) +1=58. So option C also fits the mass spec data.\n\nNow, both options B and C fit the NMR and mass spec data. How to distinguish between them?\n\nLooking back at the NMR data. For option B: CH3OCH2CONHCH3. The protons are:\n\n- CH3O (methyl) adjacent to CH2: triplet.\n\n- CH2 adjacent to CH3O and CO: quartet.\n\n- NHCH3 (methyl) adjacent to NH: singlet.\n\nFor option C: CH3NHCOOCH2CH3. The protons are:\n\n- CH3 attached to NH: singlet.\n\n- CH2CH3 (ethyl group) adjacent to O: triplet (CH3) and quartet (CH2).\n\nSo the NMR would have triplet, quartet, singlet in both cases. But the positions might differ. Wait, in option C, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. The CH2CH3 would give a triplet (CH3) and quartet (CH2). The singlet is from CH3-NH. So the same pattern as B. But how to tell them apart?\n\nMaybe looking at the coupling constants or the exact chemical shifts, but the problem doesn't give that info. So maybe we need to look at the mass spec again. For option B, the peak at 58 is from the COOCH2 fragment? Wait, earlier I thought it was from breaking between CO and NH, giving OCH2CO+ which is 58. For option C, the peak at 58 is from CH3NHCO+ (57) with a proton, making 58. Both are possible. But maybe the more likely fragmentation is for option B. Alternatively, maybe the peak at m/z=30 in option C is from OCH2+H (30), but in option B, it's from NHCH2 (30). \n\nAnother approach: look at the molecular formula and possible fragments. For option B, the fragment at 58 is OCH2CO+ (which is 12 (C) + 2 (H) + 16 (O) + 12 (C) + 16 (O) = 12+2+16+12+16=58). Yes. For option C, the fragment at 58 is CH3NHCO+ (15+14+12+16=57) with a proton, 58. Both are plausible. But which one is more likely? In mass spectrometry, the loss of a neutral fragment can lead to peaks. For option B, losing NHCH3 (31) would leave OCH2CO+ (58). For option C, losing OCH2CH3 (45) would leave CH3NHCO+ (58). Both are possible. \n\nBut the problem says that the mass spectrum contains many peaks, including one at m/z=30 and another at m/z=58. So both options B and C have these peaks. How to decide between them?\n\nLooking back at the NMR. For option B, the singlet is from the NHCH3. For option C, the singlet is from the CH3-NH. The other signals are triplet and quartet. But the positions might be different. For example, in option B, the triplet is from CH3O, which is a methyl group attached to oxygen. The chemical shift for a methyl group attached to oxygen is usually around 3.3-3.5 ppm. The quartet is from CH2 adjacent to OCH3, which would be around 3.4-3.7 ppm. The singlet from NHCH3 would be around 2.0-2.5 ppm (since it's a methyl group attached to NH). \n\nFor option C, the triplet is from the CH3 of the ethyl group (CH2CH3), which is around 0.9-1.0 ppm. The quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the ester oxygen, which would be around 3.8-4.0 ppm. The singlet from CH3-NH would be around 2.0-2.5 ppm. \n\nThe problem doesn't give chemical shifts, but maybe the integration of the signals can help. The formula is C4H9NO2, so total 9 H. The NMR has three signals: triplet, quartet, singlet. Let's check the number of protons in each signal.\n\nFor option B: triplet (CH3O, 3 H), quartet (CH2, 2 H), singlet (NHCH3, 3 H). Total 3+2+3=8 H. Wait, but the formula has 9 H. Where is the missing H? Wait, the NHCH3 has 3 H on the CH3 and 1 H on the NH? Wait, no. The structure is CH3-O-CH2-C(=O)-NH-CH3. The NH here is attached to the CO and CH3. The NH would have one H if it's NH-CH3. Wait, the NH is connected to the CO and CH3. If it's NH-CH3, then the NH has one H. So the NH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So the singlet would be the CH3 (3 H), and the NH has 1 H which is exchangeable and not observed. So the total protons observed are 3 (CH3O) + 2 (CH2) + 3 (NHCH3) = 8 H. But the formula has 9 H. Where is the missing H? The NH has 1 H, which is exchangeable and not observed. So the total observed protons are 8, plus the 1 H (NH) which is not observed. That matches the formula: 8 observed + 1 unobserved = 9 H. So that's correct.\n\nFor option C: triplet (CH3 of ethyl, 3 H), quartet (CH2 of ethyl, 2 H), singlet (CH3-NH, 3 H). Total observed protons: 3+2+3=8. The missing 1 H is the NH, which is exchangeable and not observed. That also matches the formula. So both options B and C have the same number of protons observed and unobserved.\n\nSo how to decide between B and C? Maybe the mass spec again. Let's think about the peak at m/z=30. For option B, it's likely to be NHCH2 (30), which is from losing the NHCH3 (31) and losing a proton. For option C, the peak at 30 could be OCH2+H (30), which is from the ethyl group's OCH2CH3 losing the CH3 and adding a proton. Both are possible. \n\nAnother approach: look at the possible structures and see which one is more likely to fragment in that way. In option B, the fragmentation between CO and NH would give a peak at 58 (OCH2CO+). In option C, the fragmentation between CO and O would give a peak at 58 (CH3NHCO+). Both are plausible, but maybe the fragmentation in option B is more likely because the CO-NH bond is a common site for fragmentation in amides. Alternatively, the CO-O bond is also a common site for fragmentation in esters. \n\nBut the problem states that the product is an unknown with formula C4H9NO2. The options are given. Let me check the possible structures again. \n\nOption A: CH3CH2NHCOOCH3. This is ethylamino methyl ester. \n\nOption B: CH3OCH2CONHCH3. This is methoxymethyl amide of methyl amine.\n\nOption C: CH3NHCOOCH2CH3. This is methylamino ethyl ester.\n\nOption D: already ruled out.\n\nThe problem might be looking for the correct structure based on the NMR and mass spec. Given that both B and C fit, but the mass spec peaks at 30 and 58 are more consistent with option B. Because in option B, the peak at 58 is from the OCH2CO+ fragment, which is a common fragmentation pattern for esters and amides. For option C, the peak at 58 is from CH3NHCO+, which is also possible but maybe less common. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the peak at m/z=30 in option B is from the NHCH2 fragment, and in option C it's from OCH2+H. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Another way is to check the molecular ion. The molecular ion for all options is 103. The base peak or other peaks might help, but the problem doesn't give more data. \n\nWait, maybe the integration of the NMR signals. The problem says the NMR has three signals: a triplet, quartet, and singlet. For option B, the triplet is 3 H (CH3O), quartet is 2 H (CH2), and singlet is 3 H (NHCH3). For option C, the triplet is 3 H (CH3 of ethyl), quartet is 2 H (CH2 of ethyl), and singlet is 3 H (CH3-NH). So the integration ratios are the same: 3:2:3. The problem doesn't mention integration, so it's not helpful. \n\nAnother angle: the formula C4H9NO2. Let's look at the possible functional groups. It has an amide (CONH) and an ester (COO). So the compound is an amide ester. The possible structures are:\n\n- For option B: methoxymethyl amide of methyl amine. Structure: CH3-O-CH2-C(=O)-NH-CH3. This has an ester (OCH2CO) and an amide (CONHCH3).\n\n- For option C: methylamino ethyl ester. Structure: CH3-NH-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3. This has an amide (CONHCH3) and an ester (OCH2CH3).\n\nBoth have similar functional groups. The difference is the position of the ester and amide groups. In option B, the ester is on the OCH2, and the amide is on the NHCH3. In option C, the amide is on the NHCH3, and the ester is on the OCH2CH3.\n\nThe mass spec peaks at 30 and 58 could be more consistent with option B because the fragmentation of the ester part (OCH2CO) is a common fragmentation. For example, the loss of the NHCH3 (31) would leave OCH2CO+ (58). The NHCH3 losing a proton would give 30. This seems plausible. \n\nIn option C, the fragmentation would involve losing the ester part (OCH2CH3, 45), leaving CH3NHCO+ (58). The loss of OCH2CH3 would leave a peak at 58, and the OCH2CH3 fragment could lose a CH3 to give OCH2 (29), which could be 30 with a proton. Both are possible, but I think the fragmentation in option B is more likely. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely option B: CH3OCH2CONHCH3.\n</think>"}
