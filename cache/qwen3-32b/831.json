The given equation is:\n\nH⁺ + Cr₂O₇²⁻ + C₂H₅OH → Cr³⁺ + C₂H₃OOH + H₂O\n\nHmm, first, I need to identify the oxidation states of each element to see what's being oxidized and what's being reduced. Let me start by breaking down each compound.\n\nStarting with dichromate (Cr₂O₇²⁻). Chromium in dichromate usually has an oxidation state of +6. Let me check that. The overall charge is -2, and oxygen is -2 each. So for Cr₂O₇²⁻:\n\n2Cr + 7(-2) = -2 → 2Cr -14 = -2 → 2Cr = +12 → Cr = +6. Yes, that's right. So each Cr is +6.\n\nOn the product side, Cr³⁺, so each Cr is +3. That means chromium is being reduced, gaining electrons. So that's a reduction half-reaction.\n\nNow, looking at ethanol (C₂H₅OH) and acetic acid (C₂H₃OOH, which I think is acetic acid, CH₃COOH). Let me check the oxidation states of carbon here.\n\nIn ethanol (C₂H₅OH), the oxidation state of carbon can be a bit tricky. Let me consider each carbon. Let's denote the molecule as C₂H₅OH. Let me think of it as C₂H₅OH. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write it as C₂H₅OH. Let me consider the structure: ethanol is CH₃CH₂OH. So the two carbon atoms. The first carbon is bonded to three hydrogens and the second carbon. The second carbon is bonded to two hydrogens, an oxygen (in the OH group), and the first carbon.\n\nTo find the oxidation state of each carbon in ethanol. Let me use the formula. For each carbon, the oxidation state is calculated by considering bonds. Alternatively, maybe a simpler way is to use the overall molecule.\n\nThe formula for ethanol is C₂H₆O. Wait, no. Wait, ethanol is C₂H₅OH, which is C₂H₅OH. Let me count the atoms: 2 C, 6 H, and 1 O. Wait, ethanol's formula is C₂H₅OH, which is C₂H₅OH. Let me count: 2 C, 5 H in the ethyl group, and then the OH group adds another H and O. So total H is 5 + 1 = 6? Wait, no. Wait, ethanol is CH₃CH₂OH. So the first carbon (CH₃) has 3 H, the second carbon (CH₂) has 2 H, and then the OH group. So total H is 3 + 2 + 1 (from OH) = 6? Wait, no, the OH group has one H. So total H in ethanol is 3 (from CH₃) + 2 (from CH₂) + 1 (from OH) = 6 H. So the formula is C₂H₆O. Wait, but oxygen is 1. So maybe I should use the oxidation state method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use the standard approach for balancing redox reactions. Let me consider the ethanol to acetic acid conversion. Acetic acid is CH₃COOH, which is C₂H₄O₂. So the formula for acetic acid is C₂H₄O₂. Comparing ethanol (C₂H₆O) to acetic acid (C₂H₄O₂), so each molecule of ethanol is losing 2 H and gaining one O. That suggests oxidation. So ethanol is being oxidized to acetic acid. So that's an oxidation half-reaction.\n\nSo, the two half-reactions are:\n\n1. Reduction: Cr₂O₇²⁻ → Cr³⁺\n2. Oxidation: C₂H₅OH → C₂H₃OOH (acetic acid)\n\nNow, let me balance each half-reaction separately.\n\nStarting with the reduction half-reaction:\n\nCr₂O₇²⁻ → Cr³⁺\n\nFirst, balance the chromium atoms. There are 2 Cr on the left, so need 2 Cr on the right:\n\nCr₂O₇²⁻ → 2Cr³⁺\n\nNext, balance oxygen by adding H₂O. There are 7 O on the left, so add 7 H₂O on the right:\n\nCr₂O₇²⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O\n\nNow balance hydrogen by adding H⁺. On the right, there are 14 H from 7 H₂O. So add 14 H⁺ on the left:\n\nCr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O\n\nNow balance the charges. Left side: Cr₂O₇²⁻ has -2 charge, 14 H⁺ is +14. Total charge is +12. Right side: 2Cr³⁺ is +6, 7 H₂O is neutral. Total charge is +6. So need to add electrons to the left side to make the charges equal. The difference is +12 (left) vs +6 (right). So need to add 6 electrons to the left to reduce the charge from +12 to +6.\n\nSo the balanced reduction half-reaction is:\n\nCr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ + 6e⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O\n\nNow the oxidation half-reaction:\n\nC₂H₅OH → C₂H₃OOH\n\nLet me write the formula for ethanol and acetic acid more clearly. Ethanol is C₂H₅OH, which is C₂H₆O. Acetic acid is C₂H₄O₂. Let me write the oxidation half-reaction:\n\nC₂H₅OH → C₂H₃OOH\n\nFirst, balance the carbon atoms. There are 2 C on each side, so that's balanced.\n\nNow, balance the oxygen. On the left, there's 1 O in ethanol. On the right, there are 2 O in acetic acid. So add 1 O on the left. How? Maybe by adding H₂O? Wait, but we need to consider the reaction in acidic solution (since H⁺ is present in the original equation). Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, ethanol to acetic acid. Let me write the formula:\n\nC₂H₅OH → C₂H₃OOH\n\nLet me write the oxidation states of carbon in ethanol and acetic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the standard method for balancing redox reactions.\n\nLet me consider the oxidation half-reaction. Let me balance O by adding H₂O. On the left, there's 1 O in ethanol; on the right, 2 O in acetic acid. So need to add 1 O on the left. How? Maybe by adding H₂O? Wait, but ethanol is being oxidized. Let me think again. The ethanol is C₂H₅OH (C₂H₆O). Acetic acid is C₂H₄O₂. The difference is that ethanol has 6 H and 1 O, while acetic acid has 4 H and 2 O. So to get from ethanol to acetic acid, we need to lose 2 H and gain 1 O. In acidic solution, we can add H₂O to balance O and H⁺ to balance H.\n\nSo let's balance the O first. On the right, there are 2 O in acetic acid. On the left, 1 O. So add 1 H₂O on the left? Wait, no. Wait, to balance O, if there's 1 O on the left and 2 on the right, we need to add 1 H₂O to the left? Wait, no. Wait, in redox reactions, to balance O, you add H₂O to the side that needs O. So if there's more O on the right, we add H₂O to the left. Wait, in this case, ethanol has 1 O, acetic acid has 2. So to balance O, add 1 H₂O to the left? Wait, but that would add another O. Wait, maybe I need to add H₂O to the right? No, let me recall the standard method.\n\nIn acidic solution, to balance O, add H₂O to the side that needs O. For each O needed, add 1 H₂O. Then balance H with H⁺.\n\nSo for the oxidation half-reaction:\n\nC₂H₅OH → C₂H₃OOH\n\nLeft: 1 O; Right: 2 O. So add 1 H₂O to the left:\n\nC₂H₅OH + H₂O → C₂H₃OOH\n\nNow O is balanced: left has 1 (from ethanol) + 1 (from H₂O) = 2 O; right has 2 O. Good.\n\nNow balance H. Left side has: C₂H₅OH has 6 H, H₂O has 2 H → total 8 H. Right side: C₂H₃OOH has 4 H. So difference is 8 - 4 = 4 H. In acidic solution, add H⁺ to the right side:\n\nC₂H₅OH + H₂O → C₂H₃OOH + 4H⁺\n\nNow check charges. Let me find the charges. Let's assume the oxidation half-reaction is neutral? Wait, no, in redox reactions, the charges must be balanced by adding electrons.\n\nBut first, let me check the oxidation states to confirm it's oxidation.\n\nIn ethanol, the oxidation state of each carbon. Let's calculate for ethanol (C₂H₅OH). Let me consider the molecule as C₂H₅OH. Let me assign oxidation states. The molecule is neutral, so the sum of oxidation states is 0. Let me denote each carbon.\n\nLet me consider the structure: CH₃-CH₂-OH. The first carbon (CH₃) is bonded to 3 H and the second carbon. The second carbon (CH₂) is bonded to 2 H, the first carbon, and the OH group.\n\nCalculating oxidation states for each carbon:\n\nFor the first carbon (CH₃): Let oxidation state be x. It is bonded to 3 H (each +1), 1 C (neutral), and the rest. The oxidation state is calculated by considering bonds. Alternatively, using the formula: for each bond to H, subtract 1 (since H is +1), and for each bond to O, add 1 (since O is more electronegative). But maybe a simpler approach is to use the overall molecule.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the standard method. For ethanol (C₂H₅OH), the formula can be considered as C₂H₆O. Let me use the oxidation state formula. The oxidation state of C in a compound can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each molecule, the sum of oxidation states equals the charge. For ethanol, which is neutral, sum is 0.\n\nEach H is +1, each O is -2. Let me calculate:\n\n2C + 6(+1) + 1(-2) = 0 → 2C + 6 - 2 = 0 → 2C + 4 = 0 → 2C = -4 → C = -2. So the average oxidation state of carbon in ethanol is -2.\n\nIn acetic acid (C₂H₄O₂), let's do the same. The formula is C₂H₄O₂. Sum is 0.\n\n2C + 4(+1) + 2(-2) = 0 → 2C + 4 - 4 = 0 → 2C = 0 → C = 0. So the average oxidation state of carbon in acetic acid is 0. So ethanol is being oxidized from -2 to 0, which is an increase in oxidation state, so oxidation.\n\nSo the oxidation half-reaction is losing electrons. Now back to balancing the charges.\n\nIn the oxidation half-reaction:\n\nC₂H₅OH + H₂O → C₂H₃OOH + 4H⁺\n\nLet me check the charges. Left side: ethanol and water are neutral. Right side: acetic acid is neutral, 4 H⁺ is +4. So total charge on the right is +4. To balance the charge, we need to add electrons to the right side (since it's an oxidation, electrons are products).\n\nSo the left side has 0 charge, right side has +4. To balance, add 4 electrons to the right:\n\nC₂H₅OH + H₂O → C₂H₃OOH + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻\n\nSo that's the balanced oxidation half-reaction.\n\nNow, we have two half-reactions:\n\nReduction: Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ + 6e⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O\n\nOxidation: C₂H₅OH + H₂O → C₂H₃OOH + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻\n\nNow, we need to balance the electrons. The reduction half-reaction has 6 electrons gained, and the oxidation has 4 electrons lost. To make the number of electrons equal, we can multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2. Wait, no. Wait, to balance the electrons, the number of electrons lost should equal the number gained. So the oxidation half-reaction gives 4 electrons per reaction. To get a common multiple with 6, we can multiply oxidation by 3 and reduction by 2. Let me check:\n\nReduction: 2*(Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ + 6e⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O) → gives 12 electrons gained.\n\nOxidation: 3*(C₂H₅OH + H₂O → C₂H₃OOH + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻) → gives 12 electrons lost.\n\nYes, that works. Now, combine the two half-reactions.\n\nFirst, write out the multiplied half-reactions:\n\nReduction (multiplied by 2):\n\n2Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 28H⁺ + 12e⁻ → 4Cr³⁺ + 14H₂O\n\nOxidation (multiplied by 3):\n\n3C₂H₅OH + 3H₂O → 3C₂H₃OOH + 12H⁺ + 12e⁻\n\nNow add them together:\n\n2Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 28H⁺ + 12e⁻ + 3C₂H₅OH + 3H₂O → 4Cr³⁺ + 14H₂O + 3C₂H₃OOH + 12H⁺ + 12e⁻\n\nNow cancel out the electrons and simplify the equation.\n\nElectrons (12e⁻) cancel out on both sides.\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\nOn the left: 2Cr₂O₇²⁻, 28H⁺, 3C₂H₅OH, 3H₂O.\n\nOn the right: 4Cr³⁺, 14H₂O, 3C₂H₃OOH, 12H⁺.\n\nNow, let's handle the H⁺ and H₂O.\n\nLeft side H⁺: 28H⁺\n\nRight side H⁺: 12H⁺\n\nSo subtract 12H⁺ from both sides to move them to the left:\n\nLeft side H⁺: 28H⁺ - 12H⁺ = 16H⁺\n\nSo now, left side has 16H⁺.\n\nWater molecules: Left has 3H₂O; right has 14H₂O.\n\nSo subtract 3H₂O from both sides, right has 14H₂O - 3H₂O = 11H₂O.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 16H⁺ + 3C₂H₅OH → 4Cr³⁺ + 11H₂O + 3C₂H₃OOH\n\nNow check if all elements are balanced.\n\nCr: 2*2 = 4 on left; 4 on right. Good.\n\nO: Let's count O on left and right.\n\nLeft: 2Cr₂O₇²⁻ has 2*7 = 14 O. 3C₂H₅OH has 3*1 = 3 O. Total O on left: 14 + 3 = 17.\n\nRight: 3C₂H₃OOH has 3*2 = 6 O. 11H₂O has 11 O. Total O on right: 6 + 11 = 17. Good.\n\nH: Let's check H.\n\nLeft: 16H⁺ is 16 H. 3C₂H₅OH has 3*6 = 18 H (since ethanol is C₂H₅OH which has 6 H). So total H on left: 16 + 18 = 34.\n\nRight: 3C₂H₃OOH (acetic acid). Each acetic acid has 4 H (C₂H₄O₂). So 3*4 = 12 H. 11H₂O has 22 H. Total H on right: 12 + 22 = 34. Good.\n\nCharge check:\n\nLeft side: 2Cr₂O₇²⁻ is 2*(-2) = -4. 16H⁺ is +16. 3C₂H₅OH is neutral. Total charge: -4 +16 = +12.\n\nRight side: 4Cr³⁺ is +12. 11H₂O and 3C₂H₃OOH are neutral. Total charge: +12. Balanced.\n\nSo the balanced equation is:\n\n2Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 16H⁺ + 3C₂H₅OH → 4Cr³⁺ + 3C₂H₃OOH + 11H₂O\n\nBut let me check if the acetic acid is written correctly. The original equation has C₂H₃OOH. Acetic acid is usually written as CH₃COOH, which is C₂H₄O₂. So the formula here is C₂H₃OOH. Let me confirm the formula. If we write it as C₂H₃OOH, that's C₂H₄O₂ (since the two OH groups would be H-O-O? Wait no. Wait, maybe it's C₂H₃OOH meaning CH₃COOH. Let me check the number of H. The formula C₂H₃OOH would have 3 H from C₂H₃ and then 1 H from the OH, total 4 H. So yes, it's C₂H₄O₂. So the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the balanced equation is as above. Now, let me write it in the standard form with all the coefficients.\n\nOriginal equation was:\n\nH⁺ + Cr₂O₇²⁻ + C₂H₅OH → Cr³⁺ + C₂H₃OOH + H₂O\n\nAfter balancing, the coefficients are:\n\n2Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 16H⁺ + 3C₂H₅OH → 4Cr³⁺ + 3C₂H₃OOH + 11H₂O\n\nSo the balanced equation is:\n\n16H⁺ + 2Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 3C₂H₅OH → 4Cr³⁺ + 3C₂H₃OOH + 11H₂O\n\nLet me check once more for any possible mistakes. The stoichiometry seems correct. All elements are balanced, charges are balanced. So this should be the correct balanced equation.\n</think>"}
