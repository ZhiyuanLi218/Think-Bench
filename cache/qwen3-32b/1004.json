Let me try to visualize it. There's a block attached to a horizontal spring, oscillating back and forth. Then, at some point, another block of the same mass falls on top of it and sticks. The question is asking how this affects the amplitude of the oscillations. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what factors affect the amplitude of a spring-block oscillator. The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. In a simple harmonic motion, the total mechanical energy is conserved if there's no friction or other non-conservative forces. The energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. The formula for the total mechanical energy in a spring system is (1/2)kA², where k is the spring constant and A is the amplitude. So, if energy changes, the amplitude would change accordingly.\n\nNow, when the second block falls on the first, they stick together. This is an inelastic collision. Since the collision is inelastic, kinetic energy isn't conserved, but momentum might be. But wait, in which direction is the collision happening? The original block is moving horizontally, and the second block falls on top of it. Assuming the second block is falling vertically and then sticks to the first block, which is moving horizontally. So, the collision is in the vertical direction, but the motion of the first block is horizontal. Hmm, that might be important.\n\nLet me think. If the second block is falling vertically and lands on the first block, which is moving horizontally, then the collision is in a direction perpendicular to the motion of the first block. In such a case, the horizontal momentum of the system should be conserved because there are no external horizontal forces during the collision (assuming the spring force is negligible during the brief collision time). But the vertical motion of the second block would result in a new mass on the spring system.\n\nWait, but the spring is horizontal, so gravity is acting vertically. However, since the spring is horizontal, the equilibrium position is determined by the horizontal forces. The vertical forces (gravity and normal force) would balance out, so maybe the vertical motion of the second block doesn't affect the horizontal spring system directly. But once the second block sticks to the first, the total mass of the oscillating system increases. \n\nSo, the key here is whether the collision affects the total mechanical energy of the system. Let's consider two scenarios: before and after the collision.\n\nBefore the collision, the system has some kinetic energy and some potential energy. The total energy is (1/2)kA₁², where A₁ is the initial amplitude.\n\nAfter the collision, the mass of the block doubles (since two blocks of equal mass stick together). Let's denote the original mass as m, so the new mass is 2m. Now, what happens to the velocity?\n\nSince the collision is in the vertical direction and the original block is moving horizontally, the vertical component of the second block's velocity would be stopped by the normal force from the first block. But the horizontal component of the first block's velocity would be affected by the collision. Wait, actually, the second block is falling vertically, so its horizontal velocity is zero before the collision. The first block is moving horizontally with some velocity v. When the second block lands on it, since there's no horizontal force during the collision (assuming it's instantaneous), the horizontal momentum should be conserved. \n\nSo, the initial horizontal momentum is m*v. After the collision, the combined mass is 2m, so the new velocity v' is (m*v)/(2m) = v/2. So, the velocity is halved. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy before the collision is (1/2)m*v². After the collision, it's (1/2)(2m)(v/2)² = (1/2)(2m)(v²/4) = (1/4)m*v². So the kinetic energy is reduced by half. \n\nBut what about the potential energy? At the moment of collision, the spring is at some position. Let's assume that the collision happens when the block is at a certain point in its oscillation. However, the problem doesn't specify where in the cycle the collision occurs. But the answer options include D, which says it depends on where the block was in its cycle. Hmm. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"a horizontal spring-block oscillator is in motion when a second block... falls on top of the oscillating block.\" So, the collision happens while the block is moving. But depending on where it is in the cycle (i.e., whether it's at maximum displacement or passing through equilibrium), the kinetic and potential energy will be different. \n\nBut let's think again. The total mechanical energy before collision is (1/2)kA₁². After the collision, the total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy at that moment plus the potential energy. But because the mass has changed, the system's behavior will change. However, the spring constant k doesn't change. \n\nBut here's the thing: if we consider the collision, the velocity is reduced as I calculated before. However, the position of the block (the displacement from equilibrium) at the moment of collision might affect how the energy is distributed between kinetic and potential. \n\nLet me consider two cases: one where the collision occurs at the equilibrium position (maximum velocity, zero potential energy) and one where it occurs at maximum displacement (zero velocity, maximum potential energy). \n\nCase 1: Collision at equilibrium. Before collision, all energy is kinetic: E_initial = (1/2)kA₁² = (1/2)mv². After collision, the velocity is v/2, so kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (1/4)mv². So the total energy is halved. Therefore, the new amplitude A₂ satisfies (1/2)kA₂² = (1/4)kA₁² → A₂² = (1/2)A₁² → A₂ = A₁ / √2. So amplitude decreases.\n\nCase 2: Collision at maximum displacement. Before collision, all energy is potential: E_initial = (1/2)kA₁². At this point, the velocity is zero, so when the second block lands on it, since the original block is at rest, the velocity remains zero (because the second block has zero horizontal velocity). Therefore, the kinetic energy after collision is still zero, and the potential energy is the same. Therefore, the amplitude remains the same? Wait, but the mass has changed. But since the block is at maximum displacement, the spring is stretched or compressed to that point. However, the new system has more mass but the same potential energy. \n\nBut wait, the potential energy in the spring is (1/2)kx², which doesn't depend on mass. So if the collision occurs at maximum displacement, the potential energy is the same, and the kinetic energy is zero both before and after. Therefore, the total energy remains the same. Therefore, the amplitude should remain the same? But that seems contradictory to the previous case. \n\nBut how can that be? If the collision occurs at different points, the amplitude changes or not? \n\nBut in reality, the amplitude depends on the total mechanical energy. If the collision occurs at equilibrium, where all energy is kinetic, and the kinetic energy is reduced, then the total energy decreases, leading to a smaller amplitude. If the collision occurs at maximum displacement, where all energy is potential, and since potential energy isn't affected by the collision (because velocity is zero and mass doesn't affect potential energy), then the total energy remains the same, so amplitude remains the same. \n\nTherefore, the effect on amplitude depends on where the collision occurs. If it's at equilibrium, amplitude decreases; if it's at maximum displacement, amplitude stays the same. Therefore, the answer would be D, it depends on where the original block was in its cycle when the second block fell. \n\nBut wait, let me check this again. When the collision happens at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero. The second block lands on it, but since the original block is not moving, the new block just adds mass but doesn't change the position. So the spring is still at the same displacement x = A₁. The potential energy is (1/2)kA₁². The total mechanical energy of the new system is still (1/2)kA₁², so the amplitude remains A₁. \n\nHowever, the period of oscillation will change because the mass has changed. The period T = 2π√(m/k). With double the mass, the period increases by √2. But the question is about amplitude. \n\nTherefore, if the collision occurs at different points, the amplitude might stay the same or decrease. Therefore, the answer is D. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose the collision occurs somewhere between equilibrium and maximum displacement. Let's say the block is at some position x with velocity v. The total energy before collision is (1/2)kA₁² = (1/2)kx² + (1/2)mv². After the collision, the velocity becomes v', and the position is still x. The new total energy is (1/2)kx² + (1/2)(2m)(v')². Since momentum is conserved in the horizontal direction, m*v = 2m*v' → v' = v/2. Therefore, the new total energy is (1/2)kx² + (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (1/2)kx² + (1/4)mv². \n\nBut the original total energy was (1/2)kx² + (1/2)mv². So the new energy is (original energy) - (1/4)mv². Therefore, the new total energy is less than the original. Therefore, regardless of where the collision occurs (except at maximum displacement), the total energy decreases, leading to a smaller amplitude. However, if the collision occurs at maximum displacement, where v=0, then the new energy is the same as before, so amplitude remains. \n\nTherefore, the answer depends on where in the cycle the collision occurs. So option D is correct. \n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose the collision happens at a general position. Let me denote the original mass m, original amplitude A₁. At the moment of collision, the block is at position x with velocity v. The total energy is (1/2)kA₁² = (1/2)kx² + (1/2)mv². After collision, the new mass is 2m, velocity is v/2. The new total energy is (1/2)kx² + (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (1/2)kx² + (1/4)mv². \n\nCompare this to the original total energy: (1/2)kx² + (1/2)mv². The difference is that the kinetic energy is reduced by half. Therefore, the new total energy is less than the original. Therefore, the new amplitude A₂ is such that (1/2)kA₂² = (1/2)kx² + (1/4)mv². \n\nBut since originally (1/2)kA₁² = (1/2)kx² + (1/2)mv², we can write the new energy as (1/2)kA₂² = [(1/2)kA₁² - (1/2)mv² + (1/2)mv²] - (1/4)mv²? Wait, maybe not. Let me express it differently. \n\nOriginal energy: E_initial = (1/2)kA₁² = (1/2)kx² + (1/2)mv².\n\nNew energy: E_final = (1/2)kx² + (1/4)mv².\n\nSo, E_final = E_initial - (1/4)mv².\n\nTherefore, E_final is less than E_initial. Therefore, the new amplitude A₂ must satisfy (1/2)kA₂² = E_final < E_initial = (1/2)kA₁². Therefore, A₂ < A₁. Wait, but this is only if E_final is less than E_initial. However, if the collision occurs at maximum displacement, then v=0. In that case, E_final = (1/2)kx² + 0 = E_initial. Therefore, A₂ = A₁. \n\nSo in that case, if the collision occurs at maximum displacement, the amplitude doesn't change. If it occurs at any other point, the amplitude decreases. Therefore, the answer depends on where the collision occurs. Therefore, D is correct. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a horizontal spring-block oscillator is in motion when a second block... falls on top of the oscillating block.\" It doesn't specify where. So the answer is D. \n\nBut let me check another way. Suppose we consider energy conservation. If the collision is perfectly inelastic and occurs at a random point, then the energy loss depends on the velocity at that point. Therefore, the amplitude change depends on the velocity, which varies with position. Therefore, the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, if the collision occurs when the block is passing through equilibrium (maximum velocity), then the kinetic energy is maximum, and reducing it by half would lead to a significant decrease in total energy, hence amplitude. If it occurs at maximum displacement, no change. So the answer depends on the phase. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
