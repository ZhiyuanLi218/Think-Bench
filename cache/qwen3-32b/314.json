To determine the correct one, we need to analyze the nature of intermolecular forces in argon.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Nature of Argon\n\nArgon is a **noble gas**, which means it is **monatomic** and has a **complete valence shell** of electrons. As a result, it does **not form permanent dipoles**, nor does it engage in **hydrogen bonding**, since it is not bonded to hydrogen or electronegative atoms. Therefore, **dipole-dipole interactions (option A)** and **hydrogen bonding (option B)** are not relevant in the case of argon.\n\n---\n\n### Interpreting the Options\n\n- **Option A (Dipole-dipole attractive forces)** is incorrect because argon does not have permanent dipoles.\n- **Option B (Hydrogen bonding)** is also incorrect because argon does not form hydrogen bonds.\n- **Option C (Instantaneous and induced dipoles)** refers to **London dispersion forces**, which are **temporary dipoles** caused by the random movement of electrons. These forces are **present in all atoms and molecules**, including nonpolar ones like argon.\n- **Option D (The very low temperature)** is a **condition** that allows liquefaction, but it does not **explain the mechanism** by which it occurs. The question is asking for the **reason**, not just the condition.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reason argon can be liquefied at low temperatures is due to **London dispersion forces**, also known as **instantaneous and induced dipoles**. These are the **only intermolecular forces** acting between argon atoms. While these forces are weak, they become significant at **very low temperatures**, where the kinetic energy of the atoms is reduced, allowing the weak attractions to bring the atoms close enough to form a liquid.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C: instantaneous and induced dipoles}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so the question is about why argon can be liquefied at low temperatures, and the options are A to D. Let me think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about argon. Argon is a noble gas, right? Noble gases are all in group 18 of the periodic table, and they are known for being inert, meaning they don't react much because they have a full valence shell of electrons. Since they're monatomic (existing as single atoms rather than molecules), they don't form molecules like H2 or O2. \n\nNow, when a gas liquefies, it's because the intermolecular forces between the particles are strong enough to overcome the kinetic energy of the particles, allowing them to come together into a liquid state. So the question is essentially asking which intermolecular force is responsible for argon's ability to liquefy at low temperatures.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: dipole-dipole attractive forces. These occur between polar molecules that have permanent dipoles. But argon is a noble gas, and since it's monatomic, it doesn't have permanent dipoles. So I don't think this is correct.\n\nB: hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when hydrogen is bonded to a highly electronegative atom like N, O, or F. Again, argon doesn't form molecules with hydrogen, so this is probably not the right answer.\n\nC: instantaneous and induced dipoles. These are also known as London dispersion forces. These are temporary dipoles that occur due to the movement of electrons in atoms or molecules. Even though argon is nonpolar, the electrons are in constant motion, and at any given moment, there might be an uneven distribution of electrons, creating a temporary dipole. These temporary dipoles can induce dipoles in neighboring atoms, leading to attraction. Since argon is a noble gas, this must be the type of intermolecular force it experiences.\n\nD: the very low temperature. This seems more like a statement of the condition under which liquefaction occurs rather than the reason. The question is asking why argon can be liquefied at low temperatures, not just stating that low temperature is the condition. So while low temperature is necessary, it's the intermolecular forces that make it possible. So D might be a distractor.\n\nSo putting this together, the correct answer should be C: instantaneous and induced dipoles, which are London dispersion forces. These are the only intermolecular forces present in noble gases like argon. Even though these forces are weak, at sufficiently low temperatures, the kinetic energy of the argon atoms decreases enough that these weak attractions can cause the gas to condense into a liquid.\n\nI can also cross-check this with other examples. For instance, other noble gases like helium, neon, etc., also liquefy due to London dispersion forces. So this seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
