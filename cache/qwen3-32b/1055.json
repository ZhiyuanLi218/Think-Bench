Let's evaluate each option carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Option A**  \n- **Statement I**: *Rough silicon is produced using coke and quartz sand*  \n  This is **true**. In the industrial production of silicon, quartz sand (SiO₂) is reduced with carbon (coke) in an electric arc furnace, yielding silicon and carbon monoxide:  \n  $$\n  \\mathrm{SiO_2} + 2\\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Si} + 2\\mathrm{CO}\n  $$\n\n- **Statement II**: *$\\mathrm{SiO_2}$ can be used to make optical fibers*  \n  This is also **true**. Optical fibers are typically made from ultra-pure silica (SiO₂), which has excellent optical transmission properties.\n\n- **Causal Relationship?**  \n  While both statements involve **SiO₂**, the fact that it is used in optical fibers is **not causally related** to its use in silicon production. The former is a **material application**, and the latter is a **chemical transformation**. They are two distinct uses of the same substance, but not causally linked.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B**  \n- **Statement I**: *Bromine and magnesium are extracted from seawater*  \n  This is **true**. Seawater contains dissolved bromide ions and magnesium ions, and both can be extracted through chemical and electrochemical processes.\n\n- **Statement II**: *$\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$ can be oxidized, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ can be reduced*  \n  This is also **true**. In bromine extraction, $\\mathrm{Br}^-$ is oxidized to $\\mathrm{Br}_2$, and in magnesium extraction, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is reduced to metallic $\\mathrm{Mg}$.\n\n- **Causal Relationship?**  \n  These redox reactions **are the basis** for the extraction of bromine and magnesium from seawater. Therefore, the two statements **are causally related**, and this option is **not** the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C**  \n- **Statement I**: *Petroleum cracking gas can decolorize bromine $\\mathrm{CCl_4}$ solution*  \n  This is **true**. Petroleum cracking produces unsaturated hydrocarbons like **ethylene**, which can react with bromine in $\\mathrm{CCl_4}$, causing the bromine color to fade.\n\n- **Statement II**: *Petroleum cracking can produce ethylene and other unsaturated hydrocarbons*  \n  This is also **true**. Cracking breaks down large hydrocarbons into smaller ones, including unsaturated hydrocarbons like ethylene.\n\n- **Causal Relationship?**  \n  The decolorization of bromine in $\\mathrm{CCl_4}$ is a **direct result** of the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons from cracking. Thus, the two statements **are causally related**, and this is not the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D**  \n- **Statement I**: *Hydrolysis of $\\mathrm{FeCl_3}$ can produce $\\mathrm{Fe(OH)_3}$ colloid*  \n  This is **true**. When $\\mathrm{FeCl_3}$ is hydrolyzed in water, it forms a colloid of $\\mathrm{Fe(OH)_3}$, a key step in coagulation.\n\n- **Statement II**: *$\\mathrm{FeCl_3}$ can be used as a water purifying agent*  \n  This is also **true**. $\\mathrm{FeCl_3}$ is commonly used in water treatment to coagulate suspended impurities.\n\n- **Causal Relationship?**  \n  The formation of $\\mathrm{Fe(OH)_3}$ colloid during hydrolysis is the **reason** $\\mathrm{FeCl_3}$ is effective in water purification. Hence, the two statements **are causally related**, and this is not the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Conclusion**  \nOnly **Option A** has both statements correct **and not causally related**. The first involves a **chemical production process**, and the second involves a **material application**, with no direct cause-effect link between them.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**:  \n$$\n\\boxed{A}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this question. The question is asking which option has both statements correct but not causally related. So I need to check each option, see if both statements are true, and then determine if they are related by cause and effect or not. If they are correct but not causally linked, that's the right answer.\n\nStarting with Option A: Statement I says rough silicon is produced using coke and quartz sand. I remember that in the production of silicon, they use a process where they heat quartz sand (which is SiO2) with coke (carbon) in an electric furnace. The reaction is SiO2 + 2C → Si + 2CO. So that's correct. Statement II says SiO2 can be used to make optical fibers. Yes, optical fibers are made from very pure silica (SiO2) because it can transmit light with low loss. So both statements are correct. Now, are they causally related? Well, the fact that SiO2 is used in optical fibers doesn't directly relate to how rough silicon is produced. The production of silicon uses SiO2 as a raw material, but the second statement is about a different use of SiO2. So maybe they are not causally related. So A could be a candidate.\n\nOption B: Statement I says bromine and magnesium are extracted from seawater. I know that magnesium is indeed extracted from seawater through processes involving precipitation and electrolysis. Bromine is also obtained from seawater, though it's less common. So that's correct. Statement II says Br⁻ can be oxidized and Mg²+ can be reduced. For bromine extraction, Br⁻ is oxidized (like to Br2), and for magnesium, Mg²+ is reduced to Mg metal during electrolysis. So both statements are correct. Now, are they causally related? Yes, because the reason why bromine and magnesium can be extracted is because of these redox reactions. The ability to oxidize Br⁻ and reduce Mg²+ is the basis for their extraction. So they are related, so B is not the answer.\n\nOption C: Statement I says petroleum cracking gas can decolorize bromine CCl4 solution. Petroleum cracking produces unsaturated hydrocarbons like alkenes. Alkenes can react with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, causing the solution to decolorize because the alkene adds Br2 across the double bond. Statement II says petroleum cracking can produce ethylene and other unsaturated hydrocarbons. That's definitely true. So both statements are correct. Now, are they causally related? Yes, because the reason the cracking gas decolorizes bromine is because it contains unsaturated hydrocarbons like ethylene. So the two statements are related. Therefore, C is not the answer.\n\nOption D: Statement I says hydrolysis of FeCl3 can produce Fe(OH)3 colloid. When FeCl3 is hydrolyzed, it forms Fe(OH)3 colloid, which is used in some cases. The hydrolysis is usually done by boiling the solution. Statement II says FeCl3 can be used as a water purifying agent. FeCl3 is a coagulant; when added to water, it helps in flocculation by forming a precipitate that traps impurities. The colloid formation might be part of that process. So both statements are correct. Are they causally related? Yes, because FeCl3's ability to form a colloid (Fe(OH)3) during hydrolysis is why it's effective in water purification. So the hydrolysis producing the colloid is the reason for its use as a purifying agent. Therefore, D is related, so not the answer.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A. Let me check again. In option A, the production of rough silicon uses SiO2 and carbon, and SiO2 is also used for optical fibers. These are two separate uses of SiO2, so the fact that one is produced (as in the first statement) doesn't cause the other use (second statement). They are both correct but not causally linked. The other options have statements that are related. So A is the correct choice.\n</think>"}
