Hmm, let me start by trying to factor this polynomial. \n\nFirst, maybe I can look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the divisors of the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. The constant term here is -4, and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4. Let me test them.\n\nTesting x=1: $1^8 + 3*1^4 -4 = 1 + 3 -4 = 0. Oh, so 1 is a root. That means (x - 1) is a factor. Similarly, let me check x=-1: $(-1)^8 + 3*(-1)^4 -4 = 1 + 3 -4 = 0. So -1 is also a root. So (x + 1) is another factor. \n\nSo maybe I can factor out (x - 1)(x + 1) = x² - 1. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division. Let me try dividing the original polynomial by x² - 1. Alternatively, since x² - 1 divides the polynomial, maybe I can write the original polynomial as (x² - 1) * Q(x), where Q(x) is another polynomial. Let me try to find Q(x).\n\nLet me set up the division. Let me write the original polynomial as x^8 + 0x^7 + 0x^6 + 0x^5 + 3x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 4. Dividing by x² - 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe substitution. Let me note that x^8 - 1 would factor as (x² - 1)(x^6 + x^4 + x² + 1). But our polynomial is x^8 + 3x^4 - 4. Let me see if I can relate this to x^8 - 1. \n\nOriginal polynomial: x^8 + 3x^4 - 4. Let me write this as (x^8 - 1) + 3x^4 - 3. Which is (x^8 - 1) + 3(x^4 - 1). Then, since x^8 - 1 = (x^4)^2 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1), so substituting:\n\nOriginal polynomial becomes (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1) + 3(x^4 - 1) = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1 + 3) = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4). \n\nOh! That's a nice factorization. So we have:\n\n$x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4)$. \n\nNow, let me check if these factors can be factored further. \n\nStarting with $x^4 - 1$. This is a difference of squares: $x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)$. And $x^2 - 1$ factors further into (x - 1)(x + 1). So, so far we have:\n\n$x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 4)$.\n\nNow, need to check if $x^2 + 1$ and $x^4 + 4$ can be factored further over integers. \n\nStarting with $x^2 + 1$. This is irreducible over integers because it doesn't have real roots (discriminant is -4) and since it's quadratic, if it factors, it would have linear factors, which it doesn't. So $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible.\n\nNow, what about $x^4 + 4$? Hmm, maybe this can be factored. Let me try. Sometimes, quartic polynomials can be factored into quadratics. Let me attempt to factor $x^4 + 4$ as a product of two quadratics with integer coefficients.\n\nAssume $x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$. Multiplying out:\n\n$x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd$.\n\nSet equal to $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4$. Therefore, we have the following equations:\n\n1. $a + c = 0$ (coefficient of x^3)\n2. $ac + b + d = 0$ (coefficient of x^2)\n3. $ad + bc = 0$ (coefficient of x)\n4. $bd = 4$ (constant term)\n\nFrom equation 1: c = -a.\n\nPlugging c = -a into equation 3:\n\nad + b(-a) = 0 => a(d - b) = 0. So either a = 0 or d = b.\n\nCase 1: a = 0. Then c = 0. Then equation 2 becomes 0 + b + d = 0 => b + d = 0. Equation 4: bd = 4. So we have two numbers b and d such that b + d = 0 and bd = 4. Then d = -b, so -b² = 4 => b² = -4. No real solutions, so no integer solutions. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.\n\nCase 2: d = b. Then equation 4: b*d = b² = 4 => b = ±2. Let's check for b = 2 and b = -2.\n\nFirst, b = 2. Then d = 2. From equation 2: ac + b + d = (-a²) + 2 + 2 = -a² + 4 = 0 => -a² + 4 = 0 => a² = 4 => a = ±2. Therefore, possible a = 2 or a = -2. Let's check equation 3. Since equation 3 is satisfied because we are in case 2 (d = b). Wait, equation 3 was already used to get here. Let me check if there are any contradictions. \n\nIf a = 2, c = -2, b = d = 2. Let's check the coefficients. The quadratic factors would be (x² + 2x + 2)(x² - 2x + 2). Let me multiply them:\n\nFirst, multiply (x² + 2x + 2)(x² - 2x + 2). Let me compute:\n\n= x²(x² - 2x + 2) + 2x(x² - 2x + 2) + 2(x² - 2x + 2)\n\n= x^4 - 2x³ + 2x² + 2x³ - 4x² + 4x + 2x² - 4x + 4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4 + (-2x³ + 2x³) + (2x² - 4x² + 2x²) + (4x - 4x) + 4\n\nSimplifies to:\n\nx^4 + 0x³ + 0x² + 0x + 4 = x^4 + 4. Perfect! So that works. \n\nSimilarly, if a = -2, then c = 2, and b = d = 2. Then factors would be (x² - 2x + 2)(x² + 2x + 2), which is same as above. \n\nSo $x^4 + 4$ factors into $(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)$. \n\nTherefore, our original polynomial factors as:\n\n$(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)$.\n\nNow, need to check if these factors are irreducible over integers. \n\n- $x - 1$ and $x + 1$ are linear, so they are irreducible.\n- $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over integers, as discussed before.\n- $x^2 + 2x + 2$: Let's check if it factors. The discriminant is $b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4 < 0$, so no real roots. Since it's quadratic, it's irreducible over integers.\n- Similarly, $x^2 - 2x + 2$ has discriminant $4 - 8 = -4 < 0$, so also irreducible over integers. \n\nTherefore, the complete factorization into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients is:\n\n$(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)$.\n\nSo there are 5 factors: p1, p2, p3, p4, p5. Now, need to compute p1(1) + p2(1) + p3(1) + p4(1) + p5(1).\n\nLet me compute each one:\n\np1(x) = x - 1. So p1(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\np2(x) = x + 1. p2(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\np3(x) = x² + 1. p3(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\np4(x) = x² + 2x + 2. p4(1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\np5(x) = x² - 2x + 2. p5(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1.\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\np1(1) = 0\n\np2(1) = 2\n\np3(1) = 2\n\np4(1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5? Wait 1² is 1, 2*1 is 2, so 1 + 2 + 2 = 5? Yes.\n\np5(1) = 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. Correct. \n\nTotal sum: 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10. \n\nBut let me check if I have all factors. Original polynomial factors into 5 polynomials? Let me count:\n\n(x - 1), (x + 1), (x² + 1), (x² + 2x + 2), (x² - 2x + 2). Yes, five factors. \n\nBut let me check if maybe the problem requires ordering? The problem says \"Compute p1(1) + p2(1) + ... + pk(1)\" where the factors are p1,...,pk. However, the problem says \"cannot be factored further over the integers\", so as long as they are irreducible. But the order? The problem says \"each non-constant polynomial p_i(x) is monic with integer coefficients...\". The question is, does the order matter? For example, if there are multiple factors of same degree, how are they ordered? The problem says \"compute the sum\", which is independent of the order. So regardless of how they are ordered, the sum is 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10. \n\nBut let me verify my factorization again. Let me multiply all factors and check if we get the original polynomial. \n\nFirst multiply (x - 1)(x + 1) = x² - 1.\n\nMultiply by (x² + 1): (x² - 1)(x² + 1) = x^4 - 1.\n\nMultiply by (x² + 2x + 2)(x² - 2x + 2). Earlier we saw that this product is x^4 + 4. Therefore, multiplying x^4 - 1 by x^4 + 4 gives (x^4)^2 + 4x^4 - 1*x^4 - 4 = x^8 + 3x^4 - 4, which is the original polynomial. So factorization is correct. \n\nTherefore, the sum is 10. But let me check again each p_i(1):\n\np1(1) = 0, p2(1)=2, p3(1)=2, p4(1)=5, p5(1)=1. Total 10. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the factorization? Let me check if there are other factors. For example, could x^4 + 4 factor further? No, we already factored it into two quadratics, which are irreducible. So the factorization is complete. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to factor the original polynomial? Let me check. Suppose I didn't think of the substitution. Let me try another approach. \n\nOriginal polynomial is x^8 + 3x^4 - 4. Let me make substitution y = x^4. Then polynomial becomes y² + 3y - 4. Let me factor that. y² + 3y - 4 factors as (y + 4)(y - 1). Therefore, substituting back, (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1). Which is same as before. Then same factorization. So yes, same result. \n\nTherefore, the factorization is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 10. \n\nWait, but let me check once more the sum. Let me write all factors again:\n\n1. p1(x) = x - 1, p1(1) = 0\n\n2. p2(x) = x + 1, p2(1) = 2\n\n3. p3(x) = x² + 1, p3(1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. p4(x) = x² + 2x + 2, p4(1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n\n5. p5(x) = x² - 2x + 2, p5(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1\n\nAdding them: 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10. \n\nYes, seems correct. \n\nBut let me check if maybe there is a different factorization where some of these factors are combined? For example, if there was a higher degree polynomial. But since we already factored into irreducible polynomials, we can't combine them further. For example, (x - 1) is degree 1, irreducible. Same with (x + 1). The rest are quadratics which are irreducible. Therefore, the factorization is complete. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the factors to be ordered in some specific way? For example, ordering by degree or lexicographically? But regardless, the sum would be same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the number of factors? Let me check:\n\nOriginal factors after full factorization: (x - 1), (x + 1), (x² + 1), (x² + 2x + 2), (x² - 2x + 2). That's five factors. So k = 5. \n\nBut let me check if maybe (x² + 1) can be factored further? Over integers, no. Over real numbers, yes, but problem says over integers. \n\nTherefore, conclusion is sum is 10. \n\nBut let me check once again by evaluating the original polynomial at x=1 and see if the product of p_i(1) equals the original polynomial evaluated at 1. \n\nOriginal polynomial at x=1: 1^8 + 3*1^4 - 4 = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0. \n\nProduct of p_i(1): 0 * 2 * 2 * 5 * 1 = 0. Which matches. \n\nBut since one of the factors is zero, the product is zero. So that checks out. \n\nBut the question is about the sum of p_i(1), not the product. So 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 10. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10}\n</think>"}
