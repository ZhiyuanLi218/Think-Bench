The question is about oxygen gas being heated from 50°C to 100°C, and we need to figure out which statement correctly describes the change in the gas molecules. The options are about velocity and kinetic energy increasing by certain factors.\n\nFirst, I remember that the kinetic theory of gases relates temperature to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. The formula that comes to mind is that the average kinetic energy (KE) is proportional to the absolute temperature (in Kelvin). So KE_avg = (3/2)kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant. So if the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy should increase proportionally.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives temperatures in Celsius, so I need to convert them to Kelvin. Let me do that. The initial temperature is 50°C, which is 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K. The final temperature is 100°C, which is 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 K. So the ratio of temperatures is 373.15 / 323.15 ≈ 1.154. So the temperature increases by a factor of about 1.154. Therefore, the average kinetic energy should also increase by the same factor, since KE is proportional to T. So looking at the options, option D says kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2. Since 1.154 is less than 2, that would make D correct for kinetic energy. But let me check the options again. The options for kinetic energy are C: increases by factor of 2, and D: less than 2. So D is correct for kinetic energy.\n\nNow for the velocity part. The average velocity (or root-mean-square velocity) of gas molecules is related to temperature. The formula for root-mean-square speed is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and M is molar mass. So velocity is proportional to the square root of temperature. So if temperature increases by a factor of 1.154, then the velocity should increase by the square root of 1.154. Let me calculate that. sqrt(1.154) ≈ 1.074. So the velocity increases by about 7.4%. That's nowhere near a factor of two (which would be doubling) or four. So options A and B are incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer for velocity-related options would not be A or B. But the question is asking which statement best describes the behavior. The options are A and B for velocity, C and D for KE.\n\nSo the correct statements are D for kinetic energy. The options are:\n\nA: Velocity doubles. No, since sqrt(2) would require temperature to quadruple. Because if T doubles, velocity increases by sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, but here T only increased by ~1.154, so velocity increases by ~1.074.\n\nB: Velocity increases by factor of four. Even worse. To get velocity to quadruple, temperature would need to increase by a factor of 16 (since velocity is sqrt(T)), which is way beyond here.\n\nC: KE increases by factor of 2. But the actual increase is ~1.154, so C is incorrect.\n\nD: KE increases by factor of less than 2. Yes, since 1.154 < 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Sometimes people might mistakenly use Celsius temperatures directly instead of Kelvin. Let's see what would happen if someone forgot to convert to Kelvin. Initial T is 50°C, final is 100°C, so ratio is 100/50 = 2. Then KE would double, which would make option C correct. But that's wrong because the formulas require absolute temperature. So the correct approach is to use Kelvin, leading to D. So the answer is D.\n\nAnother point: The question says \"oxygen gas\", but since it's an ideal gas, the type of gas doesn't affect the relation between temperature and KE or velocity, as long as we're considering the same gas (so molar mass is constant). So the fact that it's oxygen doesn't change the proportional relationships here.\n\nSo yes, D is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
