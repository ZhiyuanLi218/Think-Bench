We are asked to identify the **correct** statement among four options (A to D). Let's evaluate each in turn.\n\n---\n\n### Option A:  \n**\"The irregular motion of particles suspended in a liquid is called Brownian motion.\"**\n\nThis is **correct**.  \nBrownian motion refers to the **random, irregular motion** of **small particles suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas)**. This motion results from **collisions with the fluid molecules**, which are in constant thermal motion. The phenomenon was first observed by botanist Robert Brown in 1827 and later explained by Einstein in terms of kinetic theory.\n\nSo, **Option A is valid**.\n\n---\n\n### Option B:  \n**\"The irregular motion of liquid molecules is called Brownian motion.\"**\n\nThis is **incorrect**.  \nThe **motion of the liquid molecules** themselves is a result of **thermal motion**, not Brownian motion. Brownian motion **specifically refers to the motion of the suspended particles**, not the fluid molecules.\n\n---\n\n### Option C:  \n**\"When an object absorbs heat from the external environment, its internal energy is bound to increase.\"**\n\nThis is **not necessarily true**.  \nAccording to the **first law of thermodynamics**:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ \\Delta U $ is the change in internal energy,\n- $ Q $ is the heat added to the system,\n- $ W $ is the work done **by** the system.\n\nIf the object **absorbs heat** (i.e., $ Q > 0 $), but **also does work** (i.e., $ W > 0 $), the **internal energy may not increase**. For instance, if $ Q = W $, then $ \\Delta U = 0 $. Therefore, the internal energy **is not guaranteed to increase**, so this statement is **not always true**.\n\n---\n\n### Option D:  \n**\"When an object does work on the external environment, its internal energy is bound to decrease.\"**\n\nThis is also **not necessarily true**.  \nAgain using the first law of thermodynamics:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n$$\n\nIf the object **does work** ($ W > 0 $), but **also receives heat** ($ Q > 0 $), the internal energy **could still increase**. For example, if $ Q > W $, then $ \\Delta U > 0 $. So the internal energy **is not bound to decrease**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong the four options, only **Option A** is **correct** in both its **description** and **scientific accuracy**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:  \n**Option (A)**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the correct answer here. The question is about thermodynamics and Brownian motion. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"The irregular motion of particles suspended in a liquid is called Brownian motion.\" I remember that Brownian motion is the random movement of particles in a fluid due to collisions with the molecules of the fluid. So if the particles are suspended in a liquid, their irregular motion would indeed be Brownian motion. But wait, isn't Brownian motion also observed in gases? But the option says \"in a liquid,\" which is correct. So A might be correct.\n\nOption B: \"The irregular motion of liquid molecules is called Brownian motion.\" Hmm, no, because the liquid molecules themselves are the ones causing Brownian motion by colliding with the suspended particles. The motion of the liquid molecules is just their normal thermal motion, not Brownian motion. Brownian motion refers to the suspended particles' movement, not the fluid's molecules. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"When an object absorbs heat from the external environment, its internal energy is bound to increase.\" According to the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W, where Q is heat added to the system and W is work done by the system. If the object absorbs heat (Q positive), but if it does work (W positive), then the internal energy might not increase. For example, if Q equals W, then ΔU is zero. So the internal energy doesn't necessarily increase. Therefore, C is not necessarily true.\n\nOption D: \"When an object does work on the external environment, its internal energy is bound to decrease.\" Again, using the first law: ΔU = Q - W. If the object does work (W is positive), but if heat is added to the system (Q positive), the internal energy might not decrease. For instance, if Q is greater than W, ΔU is positive. So D is not necessarily true.\n\nSo the correct statements are A. Let me check again. Yes, A is correct. B is incorrect because it's the suspended particles, not the liquid molecules. C and D are incorrect because internal energy change depends on both heat and work. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n</think>"}
