The problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer in the lab. The speed of light in vacuum is given as c=1. The options are A to D. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, especially when dealing with light, special relativity might come into play. But wait, the problem mentions the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's a simple velocity addition problem? But in classical mechanics, if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, you might just add the velocities. However, since light is involved and the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames according to special relativity, I need to recall how velocities add in relativity.\n\nWait, but the light is propagating through a medium (glass) that has an index of refraction n. In vacuum, the speed of light is c=1, but in the glass, the speed is usually c/n. But here the glass is moving. So maybe I need to find the speed of light in the glass's rest frame first, and then apply the relativistic velocity addition formula to get the speed in the lab frame?\n\nLet me break it down. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light would be 1/n (since c=1). Now, the glass is moving with velocity v in the lab frame, same direction as the light. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be the combination of the glass's speed and the light's speed in the glass's frame.\n\nBut in classical terms, if you just added them, you might say (1/n) + v. But since we are dealing with relativity, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula for adding two velocities u' (in the moving frame) and v (the velocity of the moving frame relative to the lab) is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). Since c=1, this simplifies to u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).\n\nSo in this case, u' is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, which is 1/n. Then plugging into the formula, u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ). Let me write that out:\n\nu = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (v / n) ]\n\nTo simplify the expression, multiply numerator and denominator by n:\n\nNumerator becomes 1 + v n\n\nDenominator becomes n + v\n\nTherefore, u = (1 + v n) / (n + v)\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that would be option C. Let me check the options again:\n\nA: (1 + n v)/(n - v)\n\nB: 1\n\nC: (1 + n v)/(n + v)\n\nD: (1 - n v)/(n + v)\n\nYes, so option C matches the result from the relativistic velocity addition. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, if the glass is moving toward the observer, then the direction of the glass's velocity is same as the direction of the light beam? Wait, if the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light beam is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's movement, then depending on the setup, maybe the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. For example, if the glass is moving to the right, and the light beam is also moving to the right through the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving to the right at speed 1/n. Then the lab frame sees the glass moving to the right at v, so using velocity addition, we add the velocities as I did before.\n\nBut if the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then if the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving toward them, then the direction of the light beam would also be toward the observer? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the direction.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory.\" So the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and that direction is toward the observer. So imagine the observer is on the left, and the glass is moving to the left (toward the observer), and the light beam is also moving to the left through the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving to the left at speed 1/n. Then the glass is moving to the left at speed v in the lab frame. So when applying the velocity addition formula, we need to be careful about the signs.\n\nBut since the problem says to take c=1, and we are to compute the speed relative to the lab. Let me think again. Let me define the direction toward the observer as positive. Let me assume that in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity +v (toward the observer), and the light is moving in the same direction (toward the observer) through the glass. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving toward the observer (same direction as the glass's motion in lab) with speed 1/n. So when transforming back to the lab frame, we need to apply the velocity addition formula where the glass is moving at +v, and the light is moving at +u' = +1/n in the glass's frame.\n\nTherefore, using the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nu = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v )\n\nWhich gives us:\n\nu = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )\n\nWhich is the same as before. Multiplying numerator and denominator by n:\n\nu = (1 + n v)/ (n + v )\n\nWhich is option C. Therefore, the answer should be C. But let me check if there's another approach or if I might have mixed up the direction.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that since the glass is moving, maybe you just add velocities classically? But in that case, it would be (1/n + v), but that would be greater than c if v is significant. However, since we are to use relativity, the correct formula is the relativistic one. Therefore, option C is correct. Also, if n=1 (vacuum), then u=(1 + v)/ (1 + v )=1, which is correct. If v=0, then u=1/n, which is correct. So the formula makes sense in limits. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nAnother check: if the glass is moving in the opposite direction, but the problem says same direction as the beam. But in this case, direction is same as beam and toward observer. So I think my reasoning holds. Hence, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
