Let me start by visualizing the problem. There's a thin-walled cylindrical plunger with one end closed and the open end facing downward. It's inserted into a liquid of density ρ. Initially, there's some gas trapped inside, and when the external pressure increases, the plunger sinks. The temperature is constant, so this is an isothermal process. \n\nFirst, let me recall that for an ideal gas at constant temperature, Boyle's Law applies: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂. That might come into play here. But there are also forces involved because the plunger is sinking into the liquid. The pressure inside the gas will depend on the external pressure and the depth it's submerged to.\n\nLet me define some variables. Let me assume the cross-sectional area of the plunger is A. Since it's a cylinder, the volume of the gas is V = A * h, where h is the height of the gas column inside the plunger. However, the problem mentions the sinking depth x. So, when the plunger sinks deeper into the liquid, the depth x increases, which affects the pressure on the gas inside. \n\nWait, but how exactly is x defined? Is x the depth from the surface of the liquid to the open end of the plunger? Or is it the depth from the original position? Maybe I need to clarify that. \n\nLet me think. Initially, before the pressure change, the plunger is inserted into the liquid to some depth. When the external pressure increases, the plunger sinks further. The problem says \"sinking depth x,\" so maybe x is the depth from the original position? Or maybe it's the total depth from the surface? The problem isn't entirely clear, but perhaps I can define it as the depth from the surface to the open end of the plunger. \n\nBut let me try to draw a diagram mentally. The plunger is like a cylinder, open end down. Initially, it's floating or inserted into the liquid with some gas trapped inside. The external pressure is p₀, which I assume is atmospheric pressure? Then, the pressure inside the gas would be equal to the external pressure plus the pressure due to the column of liquid above it. Wait, no—if the plunger is submerged into the liquid, the pressure inside the gas would balance the external pressure (which is atmospheric) plus the pressure from the liquid column above the plunger. Wait, but if the open end is facing downward, then the gas is pushing up against the liquid. Hmm.\n\nLet me think again. The plunger is inserted into the liquid with the open end down. So, the gas is trapped inside, and the open end is submerged. The pressure of the gas inside would need to balance the external pressure at the depth where the open end is located. \n\nSo, if the plunger is at a depth x (assuming x is the depth from the surface to the open end), then the pressure of the gas inside would be equal to the external pressure at that depth. The external pressure at depth x is p₀ + ρgx, where p₀ is the atmospheric pressure (or whatever the pressure is at the surface). But in this problem, the external pressure suddenly increases from p₀ to 2p₀. Wait, does that mean the pressure at the surface of the liquid is increased from p₀ to 2p₀? For example, maybe someone pressurizes the tank or something? \n\nSo, initially, the external pressure at the surface is p₀. When it increases to 2p₀, then the pressure at depth x would be 2p₀ + ρgx? Wait, no. If the external pressure at the surface is increased to 2p₀, then the pressure at depth x would be 2p₀ + ρgx? Or is it that the pressure is increased by Δp? The problem says \"external pressure suddenly increases from p₀ to 2p₀\". So, the external pressure at the surface is now 2p₀. Therefore, the pressure at depth x would be 2p₀ + ρgx? But that seems like a lot. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the external pressure is the pressure acting on the plunger from outside. Wait, the plunger is in the liquid. The pressure on the outside of the plunger would be the liquid pressure. Wait, but the external pressure mentioned in the problem is probably the atmospheric pressure or some other external pressure that is applied to the liquid. For example, if you have a tank of liquid open to the atmosphere, then the pressure at the surface is atmospheric pressure p₀. If you somehow increase the external pressure on the liquid (like by putting a lid and pumping more pressure in), then the pressure at the surface becomes 2p₀. Then, the pressure at depth x would be 2p₀ + ρgx. \n\nBut then, how does this relate to the pressure inside the gas in the plunger? The pressure inside the gas has to balance the pressure outside at the depth where the open end of the plunger is. Since the open end is facing down, the gas is pushing up against the liquid. Therefore, the pressure of the gas must equal the pressure of the liquid at that depth. Otherwise, there would be a net force causing the plunger to move. \n\nSo, initially, before the pressure increases, let me denote some variables. Let me assume that initially, the plunger is at some depth x₀, and the volume of the gas is V₀. The pressure inside the gas is p_inside = p₀ + ρg x₀. \n\nBut when the external pressure is doubled to 2p₀, the pressure at depth x becomes 2p₀ + ρg x. Therefore, the new pressure inside the gas must be equal to 2p₀ + ρg x, where x is the new depth. \n\nBut since the temperature is constant, we can use Boyle's Law: p₁ V₁ = p₂ V₂. \n\nSo initially, the pressure p₁ is p₀ + ρg x_initial, and volume V₁. After the pressure increases, the pressure p₂ is 2p₀ + ρg x, and volume V_x. \n\nBut wait, what is x_initial? Is it given? The problem doesn't specify any initial conditions except that when the external pressure increases, the plunger sinks. So maybe we need to relate V_x and x without knowing the initial volume? \n\nWait, but the problem says \"find the relationship between the current volume V_x of the gas inside the plunger and the sinking depth x\". So, maybe we need an equation that relates V_x and x, considering that when the external pressure changes, the depth x changes, and the volume changes accordingly. \n\nBut how do we relate x and V_x? \n\nLet me think. The plunger is a cylinder. Let me denote the cross-sectional area as A. Then, the volume of the gas is V_x = A * h, where h is the length of the gas column inside the plunger. \n\nBut how does the depth x relate to h? If the plunger is sinking into the liquid, then the total length of the plunger might be something, but since it's thin-walled, maybe we can assume that the cross-sectional area is constant and that the depth x is related to how much the plunger has sunk. Wait, perhaps the depth x is the depth of the open end of the plunger, and the length of the gas column inside is h. Then, if the plunger is sinking deeper, x increases, and h decreases? \n\nBut how are x and h related? If the plunger is a cylinder, then the total length of the plunger is fixed? Or is it flexible? Wait, the problem says it's a thin-walled cylindrical plunger. Maybe it's like a piston? But it's inserted into the liquid. If the plunger is rigid, then h would be fixed, but the problem says that when the external pressure increases, the plunger sinks. So, perhaps the plunger is like a tube that can be compressed? Or maybe it's a piston that can move, allowing the gas volume to change. \n\nWait, maybe the plunger is like a cylinder that can move vertically, with the open end down. So, as it sinks deeper, the gas is compressed. So, the depth x is the depth of the open end, and the length of the gas column is h. Therefore, the total length of the plunger is h plus whatever is submerged? Wait, no. If the open end is at depth x, and the plunger has a closed end, then the entire plunger is submerged up to the open end. Wait, maybe the plunger is like a tube with the closed end at the top and open end at the bottom. If you push it into the liquid, the depth of the open end is x, and the length of the tube is h. But if it's sinking, maybe the length h is changing? \n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to define variables more clearly.\n\nLet me assume that the plunger has a total length L, but since it's thin-walled, maybe we don't need to consider that? Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention the total length. Maybe instead, we can think of the volume of the gas as V_x = A * (L - x)? No, that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the plunger is inserted into the liquid such that the open end is at depth x, and the closed end is at depth x + h, where h is the length of the plunger? But if the plunger is sinking deeper, then x increases, and h would also increase? No, if it's sinking deeper, the open end is deeper, but the length of the gas column inside would decrease if the plunger is being compressed. \n\nWait, maybe the plunger is like a vertical cylinder with the open end down. Initially, it's partially submerged, with some gas inside. When external pressure increases, it sinks further, compressing the gas. The volume of the gas is related to how much it's compressed, which is related to the depth. \n\nBut to relate V_x and x, we need to know how the depth affects the pressure inside the gas, and how the volume relates to the depth. \n\nLet me try to think of it as follows. Suppose the cross-sectional area of the plunger is A. The volume of the gas is V_x = A * h, where h is the height of the gas column inside the plunger. \n\nWhen the plunger is submerged to a depth x (depth of the open end), the pressure inside the gas must balance the external pressure at that depth. The external pressure at depth x is p_external = 2p₀ + ρ g x (since the external pressure at the surface is now 2p₀). \n\nTherefore, the pressure of the gas is p_gas = 2p₀ + ρ g x. \n\nSince the temperature is constant, we can relate the initial state to the final state with Boyle's Law. \n\nBut what is the initial state? Before the pressure increase, the external pressure at the surface was p₀, so the pressure at depth x_initial (the initial depth of the open end) was p₀ + ρ g x_initial. \n\nAssuming that initially, the plunger was in equilibrium, so the gas pressure was equal to that. \n\nBut the problem doesn't give us any initial conditions. It just says that when the external pressure suddenly increases from p₀ to 2p₀, the plunger sinks. So, maybe we need to consider the initial state just before the pressure increase and relate it to the new state after the pressure increase. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nBefore the pressure increase:\n\np₁ = p₀ + ρ g x₁\n\nV₁ = A h₁\n\nAfter the pressure increase:\n\np₂ = 2p₀ + ρ g x\n\nV₂ = A h = V_x\n\nBut since the temperature is constant, p₁ V₁ = p₂ V₂.\n\nBut we need to relate x and V_x. However, we have two unknowns here: x₁ and V₁? Unless there is another relationship between x and the plunger's position. \n\nWait, but when the pressure increases, the plunger sinks, so the depth x is changing. However, is there a force balance that relates the depth x to the volume? \n\nThe plunger is submerged in the liquid. Assuming it's in equilibrium, the forces on the plunger must balance. The forces on the plunger would include the pressure forces and the weight of the plunger. But the problem says it's a thin-walled cylindrical plunger. Is the weight of the plunger considered? The problem doesn't mention it. Maybe we can assume that the plunger is weightless? Or maybe the weight is negligible? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that the only forces are the pressure forces. \n\nWait, if the plunger is in equilibrium, then the pressure inside the gas must balance the external pressure at the depth of the open end. Therefore, regardless of the weight, as long as it's in equilibrium, p_gas = external pressure at depth x. \n\nTherefore, maybe the weight isn't a factor here? Maybe the plunger is massless and just moves to adjust the gas pressure to balance the external pressure. \n\nIf that's the case, then before the pressure increase, the gas pressure was p₀ + ρ g x_initial, and after the pressure increase, it's 2p₀ + ρ g x. \n\nBut we need to relate V_x and x. Using Boyle's Law: p₁ V₁ = p₂ V₂. \n\nBut we need to know p₁ and V₁. However, we don't have information about the initial state. Unless the initial state is when the external pressure was p₀, and the plunger was at some depth x_initial, and after the pressure increases, it moves to a new depth x. \n\nBut without knowing x_initial or V₁, how can we relate V_x and x? \n\nWait, perhaps there is another relationship. If the plunger is sinking, the depth x is related to the volume through the geometry of the plunger. For example, if the plunger is a cylinder, then the volume of gas is A times the length of the gas column. If the plunger is sinking into the liquid, the length of the gas column is related to how much it's been submerged. \n\nBut how exactly? Let me think. Suppose the plunger has a total length L. Initially, it is inserted into the liquid so that the open end is at depth x_initial, and the closed end is at depth x_initial + h_initial, where h_initial is the length of the gas column. Wait, but if it's sinking deeper, then the open end is at depth x, and the closed end is at depth x + h, where h is the new length of the gas column. \n\nBut if the plunger is sinking, then the depth x increases, but the length h decreases because the gas is compressed. However, unless we know the total length of the plunger, we can't relate h and x. \n\nBut the problem doesn't mention the total length of the plunger. Therefore, maybe we need to assume that the plunger is long enough that we don't have to consider its total length, or that the depth x is measured from the surface to the open end, and the length of the gas column is h, so that the closed end is at depth x + h. However, if the plunger is sinking, then x increases and h decreases. But how are they related? \n\nWait, maybe there's no direct relationship between x and h unless there's some other constraint. But since the problem is asking for a relationship between V_x (which is A*h) and x, there must be some connection. \n\nPerhaps the key is that when the pressure increases, the plunger is allowed to sink until the gas pressure equals the new external pressure at the new depth. However, without knowing the initial conditions, maybe we need to express the relationship in terms of the initial volume? But the problem doesn't mention initial volume. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that before the pressure change, the plunger was in equilibrium with the original pressure. Let me denote that initial state. \n\nLet me define:\n\nInitial state (before pressure increase):\n\nExternal pressure at surface: p₀\n\nDepth of open end: x_initial\n\nPressure inside gas: p₁ = p₀ + ρ g x_initial\n\nVolume of gas: V₁ = A h_initial\n\nAfter pressure increase:\n\nExternal pressure at surface: 2p₀\n\nDepth of open end: x (this is the sinking depth mentioned in the problem)\n\nPressure inside gas: p₂ = 2p₀ + ρ g x\n\nVolume of gas: V_x = A h\n\nSince temperature is constant, p₁ V₁ = p₂ V_x.\n\nBut we need another equation to relate x and V_x. However, we don't know x_initial or V₁. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another condition. If the plunger is sinking, perhaps it's moving until some equilibrium is reached. However, without knowing the initial position, how can we find a relationship? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is implying that before the pressure increase, the plunger was at some equilibrium depth, and after the pressure increases, it moves to a new equilibrium depth. However, since we don't have specific values, maybe we need to express V_x in terms of x using the fact that the product pV is constant. \n\nBut how? Let me think. If we consider that initially, the plunger was at some depth x_initial, so p₁ = p₀ + ρ g x_initial and V₁ = A h_initial. After the pressure increases, p₂ = 2p₀ + ρ g x and V_x = A h. \n\nBut since p₁ V₁ = p₂ V_x, we have:\n\n(p₀ + ρ g x_initial) * A h_initial = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * A h\n\nSimplify:\n\n(p₀ + ρ g x_initial) * h_initial = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * h\n\nBut since V_x = A h, and V₁ = A h_initial, then:\n\n(p₀ + ρ g x_initial) * V₁ / A = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * V_x / A \n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(p₀ + ρ g x_initial) * V₁ = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * V_x \n\nBut we still have two unknowns here: x_initial and V₁. \n\nIs there another relationship? Maybe the fact that the plunger was in equilibrium initially and finally? But how does that help? \n\nWait, if the plunger is in equilibrium, then the pressure inside equals the external pressure at the depth of the open end. But that's already considered in p₁ and p₂. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a buoyancy consideration? The buoyant force on the plunger would be equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. But if the plunger is massless, then the buoyant force must be balanced by something else. However, if the plunger has mass, we need to consider that. \n\nBut the problem doesn't mention the mass of the plunger. It just says it's a thin-walled cylindrical plunger. Maybe we can assume it's weightless? If so, then the only force balance is the pressure inside the gas balancing the external pressure at the depth of the open end. \n\nBut then, without knowing the initial depth or volume, how can we relate V_x and x? \n\nWait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The problem says \"the current volume V_x of the gas inside the plunger and the sinking depth x\". Maybe \"sinking depth\" refers to how much it has sunk from its original position? Let me denote the original depth as x₀, and the sinking depth as x, so the new depth is x₀ + x. Then, we can write equations in terms of x. \n\nBut again, without knowing x₀ or the initial volume, how can we get a relationship? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to express V_x as a function of x, considering that before the pressure change, the plunger was at some depth where the gas volume was V₀, and after the pressure change, it's at depth x with volume V_x, and relate them via Boyle's law. However, without knowing V₀ or x₀, maybe we need to eliminate them. \n\nLet me try. Let me assume that initially, before the pressure increase, the plunger was at depth x₀, with volume V₀. Then:\n\np₀ + ρ g x₀ = p_initial = p₀_initial_gas\n\nAfter the pressure increases to 2p₀, the new pressure at depth x is 2p₀ + ρ g x, and the new volume is V_x. So:\n\n( p₀ + ρ g x₀ ) * V₀ = ( 2p₀ + ρ g x ) * V_x \n\nBut we need another equation to relate x₀ and V₀. If we consider that initially, the plunger was also in equilibrium, so maybe there was some condition. If the plunger is weightless, then the initial pressure inside was p₀ + ρ g x₀. But without knowing anything else, we can't relate x₀ and V₀. \n\nWait, maybe the initial volume V₀ is related to the initial depth x₀ through the geometry of the plunger. For example, if the plunger is a cylinder with cross-sectional area A, then V₀ = A * h₀, where h₀ is the initial length of the gas column. If the plunger is inserted into the liquid so that the open end is at depth x₀, then the closed end is at depth x₀ + h₀. However, if the plunger is sinking, then the new depth x (of the open end) and the new length h (of the gas column) would satisfy that the closed end is at depth x + h. \n\nBut unless we have some constraint on the total length of the plunger or something else, we can't relate h and x. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that the plunger is like a piston that can move freely, and the sinking depth x is the displacement from the original position. For example, suppose initially the open end is at depth x₀, and after sinking, it's at depth x₀ + x. Then, the volume of the gas would depend on how much the plunger has been compressed. \n\nBut again, without knowing the initial volume or initial depth, how can we relate V_x and x? \n\nIs there something missing here? Maybe I need to consider that the external pressure increase causes an immediate change, and the plunger moves until the gas pressure equals the new external pressure at the new depth. However, without knowing the initial conditions, maybe the relationship is expressed in terms of the initial volume? But the problem doesn't mention that. \n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \n\n\"A thin-walled cylindrical plunger with one end closed and the open end facing downward is inserted into a liquid with density ρ. The gas trapped inside is an ideal gas. When the external pressure suddenly increases from p₀ to 2p₀, the plunger sinks. Assuming the temperature of the liquid remains constant, find the relationship between the current volume V_x of the gas inside the plunger and the sinking depth x.\"\n\nSo, there's no mention of initial depth or initial volume. Maybe the key is that before the pressure increase, the plunger was at the surface? If x = 0 initially, then the open end is at the surface. But if the open end is at the surface, then the pressure inside the gas is p₀. But then, when the external pressure increases to 2p₀, the plunger sinks until the gas pressure equals 2p₀ + ρ g x. \n\nBut if initially, the open end was at the surface (x=0), then initially, the gas pressure was p₀. After the pressure increase, the gas pressure must be 2p₀ + ρ g x. Since temperature is constant, p₁ V₁ = p₂ V_x. \n\nSo, if initially, p₁ = p₀, V₁ is the initial volume. After, p₂ = 2p₀ + ρ g x, V_x. \n\nBut what is V₁? If initially the plunger was at the surface with open end down, then the entire plunger is above the liquid? No, because it's inserted into the liquid with open end down. If the open end is at the surface, then part of the plunger is submerged? Wait, no. If it's inserted into the liquid with open end down, then if the open end is at the surface, the plunger is just touching the surface. If you push it down, the open end goes under the liquid. \n\nBut if initially, before the pressure increase, the plunger was just at the surface (x=0), then the gas pressure is p₀. When you increase the external pressure to 2p₀, the plunger sinks until the gas pressure is 2p₀ + ρ g x. \n\nBut then, using Boyle's Law: p₀ * V₁ = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * V_x. \n\nBut what is V₁? If initially, the plunger was just at the surface, then the volume of gas is V₁ = A * L, where L is the length of the plunger. But since the problem doesn't mention L, maybe we need to express the relationship without knowing L? \n\nBut the problem asks for the relationship between V_x and x. If we can express V_x in terms of V₁ and x, but since V₁ is constant (the initial volume before sinking), then maybe the answer is expressed as V_x = [p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)] * V₁. \n\nBut the problem says \"find the relationship between the current volume V_x... and the sinking depth x\". If we don't know V₁, how can we express it? \n\nWait, maybe there's another consideration. The sinking depth x is related to the volume change. If the plunger is sinking into the liquid, the volume of gas decreases as it is compressed. However, the volume of gas is also related to how much liquid has been displaced. But without knowing the mass or buoyancy, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sinking depth x is the length by which the plunger has been submerged. For example, if the plunger has cross-sectional area A, and it sinks a depth x, then the volume of liquid displaced is A * x? Wait, no. If the plunger is a cylinder inserted into the liquid with open end down, then sinking it deeper would displace more liquid. However, the volume displaced would depend on the cross-sectional area and how much it's submerged. \n\nBut if the plunger is sinking until the gas pressure equals the external pressure at depth x, then maybe we can combine the buoyancy force with the pressure balance. \n\nLet me try that approach. Assume the plunger has mass m. Then, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. The buoyant force is ρ * g * V_displaced, where V_displaced is the volume of the plunger submerged in the liquid. \n\nBut the plunger is a cylinder with open end down. If it's submerged to a depth x, then the entire plunger is submerged? Or just part of it? If the open end is at depth x, then the length submerged is x? No, because if the plunger is of length L, then if you submerge it so that the open end is at depth x, the closed end is at depth x + h, where h is the length of the gas column. Therefore, the length of the plunger submerged in liquid is x + h - 0? Wait, no. The plunger is a cylinder with open end down. The part of the plunger that is submerged is from the open end down to the closed end. But the gas is inside the plunger, so the liquid is only filling up to the open end. Wait, no. If the open end is submerged, then the liquid would enter the plunger until the pressure inside balances. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing without a diagram. Let me think of it as follows: the plunger is like a test tube with the open end down, partially submerged in water. The air inside is compressed by the water pressure. When you increase the external pressure on the water, the water level inside the test tube goes down, compressing the air further. \n\nIn this case, the volume of the gas is related to the depth of the open end. For example, if the open end is at depth x, then the pressure inside the gas is p = external pressure at the surface + pressure from the water column of height x. \n\nBut how is the volume of the gas related to x? If the plunger has cross-sectional area A, and the length of the gas column is h, then V = A*h. If the plunger is submerged so that the open end is at depth x, and the closed end is at depth x + h, then the length of the gas column is h. However, if the plunger is sinking deeper, x increases and h decreases. \n\nBut how can we relate h and x? If the plunger is rigid, then h is fixed, but the problem says that when the pressure increases, the plunger sinks, implying that h changes. Therefore, the plunger must be flexible or movable. \n\nAssume that the plunger is a piston that can move vertically, with the open end always facing down into the liquid. The volume of the gas is determined by the position of the piston. \n\nIn this case, if the plunger is moved down by a distance Δx, the volume of the gas decreases by A*Δx. But how does this relate to the depth? \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that when the plunger is at depth x, the pressure inside the gas is p = 2p₀ + ρ g x (after the pressure increase). The volume is V_x. Initially, before the pressure increase, the pressure was p₀ + ρ g x_initial, and the volume was V_initial. \n\nSince temperature is constant, p_initial * V_initial = p * V_x. \n\nBut we need to relate x and V_x. If we can express V_initial in terms of x_initial, and then find a relationship between x_initial and x, but without additional information, this seems impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that before the pressure increase, the plunger was at the surface (x_initial = 0). This is a common assumption in such problems when no initial conditions are given. Let me try that. \n\nAssume initially, the plunger is just at the surface with the open end at x_initial = 0. Therefore, the pressure inside the gas is p_initial = p₀ + ρ g * 0 = p₀. The volume is V_initial = A * L, where L is the length of the plunger. \n\nAfter the pressure increases to 2p₀, the plunger sinks to a depth x, and the pressure inside the gas is p = 2p₀ + ρ g x. The volume is now V_x = A * h, where h is the new length of the gas column. \n\nBy Boyle's Law: p_initial * V_initial = p * V_x \n\n=> p₀ * A * L = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * A * h \n\nCancel A:\n\np₀ * L = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * h \n\nBut h is the new length of the gas column. If the plunger has total length L, then when it's submerged to depth x, the length of the gas column h is L - x? No, that would be if the plunger is being submerged such that the liquid fills it up. Wait, if the open end is at depth x, and the plunger is of length L, then if it were fully submerged, the gas would be compressed to zero volume, which isn't possible. \n\nAlternatively, if the plunger is like a syringe, where the closed end is fixed, and the open end is submerged. As it sinks, the gas is compressed. If the plunger is initially at the surface with the open end at x=0, then the entire length L is above the water. When it sinks to depth x, the open end is at depth x, and the gas is compressed to a length h = L - x? No, because if you push the plunger down into the liquid, the liquid would enter the plunger, compressing the gas. So if the plunger is pushed down by a distance x, then the gas is compressed by x, so the new length is h = L - x. Therefore, V_x = A*(L - x). \n\nBut if that is the case, then we can write:\n\np₀ * A * L = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * A * (L - x)\n\nCancel A:\n\np₀ * L = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * (L - x)\n\nThen, expanding:\n\np₀ L = 2p₀ L - 2p₀ x + ρ g x L - ρ g x²\n\nRearranging:\n\n0 = p₀ L - 2p₀ x + ρ g x L - ρ g x²\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nρ g x² - ρ g L x - 2p₀ x + p₀ L = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x:\n\nρ g x² - (ρ g L + 2p₀) x + p₀ L = 0\n\nBut the problem asks for the relationship between V_x and x, not x itself. Since V_x = A(L - x), then x = L - V_x / A. \n\nBut this seems complicated. Also, we introduced L, the length of the plunger, which wasn't given in the problem. The problem doesn't mention the length of the plunger, so maybe this assumption is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the relationship between V_x and x is simply given by Boyle's Law, assuming that initially the plunger was at some depth where the gas volume was V₀, and now it's at depth x with volume V_x. But without knowing V₀ or the initial depth, we can't eliminate them. \n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Since the plunger is sinking, maybe the sinking depth x is the depth from the original position. Let me assume that initially, the plunger was at depth x = 0 with volume V₀. When the pressure increases, it sinks to depth x, and the volume becomes V_x. \n\nThen, initially, p_initial = p₀ + ρ g * 0 = p₀ \n\nAfter, p_final = 2p₀ + ρ g x \n\nBy Boyle's Law: p_initial V₀ = p_final V_x => V_x = V₀ * p_initial / p_final = V₀ * p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x) \n\nBut the problem asks for the relationship between V_x and x, which would be V_x = [V₀ p₀] / [2p₀ + ρ g x]. However, since V₀ is a constant (initial volume), this is a valid relationship, but the problem doesn't give V₀. \n\nBut maybe the sinking depth x is defined such that initially x = 0 and V = V₀, and the problem wants an expression for V_x in terms of x. If so, then the answer is V_x = [V₀ p₀] / [2p₀ + ρ g x]. But since V₀ is not given, maybe we need to express it in terms of other variables? \n\nWait, but maybe there is another condition. If initially, before the pressure increase, the plunger was in equilibrium, so p_initial = p₀ + ρ g * 0 = p₀, which is consistent. But if the plunger was inserted to depth x=0, which might mean it's at the surface. But again, without knowing the initial volume, how can we proceed? \n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to assume that the initial volume is such that when the external pressure is p₀, the plunger is at some equilibrium depth, and after the pressure increases, it moves to a new depth. However, without knowing the specifics, it's impossible to derive a numerical relationship. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that the sinking depth x is the depth that the plunger has moved from its original position, and the volume change is related to that movement. For example, if the plunger moves down by x, then the volume decreases by A*x. \n\nBut if the plunger is a cylinder with cross-sectional area A, and it moves down by x, then the volume change ΔV = -A*x. However, the initial volume V₀ = A*L, where L is the initial length of the gas column. After moving down x, the volume is V_x = V₀ - A*x. \n\nBut combining this with Boyle's Law: p₀ * V₀ = p * V_x = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * (V₀ - A x) \n\nThis would give an equation relating x and V₀, but again, without knowing V₀ or A, we can't eliminate them. \n\nBut the problem asks for the relationship between V_x and x. If we express V_x = V₀ - A x, and from Boyle's Law p₀ V₀ = (2p₀ + ρ g x) V_x, then we can write:\n\nV_x = p₀ V₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)\n\nBut since V_x = V₀ - A x, then:\n\nV₀ - A x = p₀ V₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)\n\nThis is an equation relating x and V₀, but it still contains V₀ and A. \n\nThis seems too complex and likely not what the problem expects. \n\nMaybe I need to revisit the problem statement and see if I missed something. \n\n\"A thin-walled cylindrical plunger with one end closed and the open end facing downward is inserted into a liquid with density ρ. The gas trapped inside is an ideal gas. When the external pressure suddenly increases from p₀ to 2p₀, the plunger sinks. Assuming the temperature of the liquid remains constant, find the relationship between the current volume V_x of the gas inside the plunger and the sinking depth x.\"\n\nThe key might be in the phrase \"sinking depth x\". Perhaps x is the depth from the surface to the open end of the plunger, and the volume V_x is related to x through the pressure balance. \n\nSo, after the pressure increase, the pressure inside the gas is p = 2p₀ + ρ g x, and since it's an ideal gas at constant temperature, pV = constant. \n\nBut what is the constant? Initially, before the pressure increase, the pressure inside was p_initial = p₀ + ρ g x_initial, and volume V_initial. After, p = 2p₀ + ρ g x and volume V_x. \n\nBut without knowing x_initial or V_initial, we can't write a specific relationship. Unless x_initial is zero? \n\nIf we assume that initially, before the pressure increase, the plunger was at the surface (x_initial = 0), then p_initial = p₀, and V_initial = V₀. After the pressure increases, p = 2p₀ + ρ g x, and V_x. Then, p₀ V₀ = (2p₀ + ρ g x) V_x. \n\nBut since V_x is the current volume, and the problem wants the relationship between V_x and x, this would be V_x = [p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)] * V₀. \n\nBut since V₀ is the initial volume, which is a constant, this is a valid relationship. However, the problem doesn't specify V₀, so maybe we need to express it in terms of other variables. \n\nWait, if the plunger is at the surface initially, then the volume V₀ is equal to the volume of the plunger, since it's not submerged. If the plunger has cross-sectional area A and length L, then V₀ = A*L. But again, without knowing L or A, we can't express it numerically. \n\nHowever, the problem might be expecting a general relationship where V_x is inversely proportional to (2p₀ + ρ g x), with a proportionality constant that depends on initial conditions. But since the problem doesn't provide initial conditions, maybe it's acceptable to leave it in terms of V₀? \n\nBut the problem says \"find the relationship between the current volume V_x... and the sinking depth x\". It's possible that the expected answer is simply V_x = k / (2p₀ + ρ g x), where k is a constant, but expressed in terms of initial conditions. However, since the problem doesn't give initial conditions, maybe there's another approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the sinking depth x is such that the pressure inside the gas is equal to the external pressure at that depth, and the volume is related to x through the geometry of the plunger. For example, if the plunger is a cylinder with cross-sectional area A, then the volume V_x = A * h, where h is the height of the gas column. If the open end is at depth x, then the closed end is at depth x + h. The total length of the plunger is x + h. But if initially, the plunger had a certain length, say L, then initially x_initial + h_initial = L. After sinking, x + h = L. Therefore, x + h = constant. \n\nAh! This might be the missing link. If the plunger has a fixed total length L, then the depth of the closed end is always x + h = L. Wait, no. If the plunger is inserted into the liquid, and it has total length L, then if the open end is at depth x, the closed end is at depth x + L. But that would mean that the entire plunger is submerged, and the gas is compressed to zero volume, which isn't possible. \n\nWait, no. If the plunger is a cylinder of length L, with the closed end at the top and open end at the bottom, and you submerge it into the liquid so that the open end is at depth x, then the closed end is at depth x + L. But the gas inside would occupy some volume, so the liquid would rise into the plunger, compressing the gas. The length of the gas column would be h = L - y, where y is the length of the plunger filled with liquid. But if the open end is at depth x, and the closed end is at depth x + L, then the liquid inside the plunger would be from the open end up to some point, leaving a gas column of length h. \n\nHowever, without knowing how much of the plunger is filled with liquid, it's hard to relate x and h. But if the total length of the plunger is L, then the depth of the closed end is x + h? No, if the open end is at depth x, and the gas column has length h, then the closed end is at depth x + h. Therefore, the total length of the plunger is h + y, where y is the length submerged in liquid? No, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nWait, let's think of it as the plunger has total length L. Initially, it is partially submerged, with the open end at depth x_initial, and the gas column has length h_initial = L - y_initial, where y_initial is the length of the plunger submerged in liquid. After the pressure increases, it sinks further, so the open end is at depth x, and the gas column has length h = L - y, where y is the new submerged length. \n\nBut since the total length L is fixed, we have x + h = L? No, if the open end is at depth x, and the gas column has length h, then the closed end is at depth x + h. Therefore, x + h = L_total? If the total length of the plunger is L_total, then yes. So, x + h = L_total. Therefore, h = L_total - x. \n\nTherefore, the volume of the gas is V_x = A * h = A * (L_total - x). \n\nBut then, using Boyle's Law: p_initial * V_initial = p_final * V_x. \n\nIf initially, the plunger was at some depth x_initial, then initially, h_initial = L_total - x_initial, V_initial = A*(L_total - x_initial), and p_initial = p₀ + ρ g x_initial. \n\nAfter the pressure increases to 2p₀, the new pressure is p_final = 2p₀ + ρ g x, and V_x = A*(L_total - x). \n\nSo, (p₀ + ρ g x_initial) * A*(L_total - x_initial) = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * A*(L_total - x) \n\nCancel A:\n\n(p₀ + ρ g x_initial)(L_total - x_initial) = (2p₀ + ρ g x)(L_total - x)\n\nThis is a relationship between x and x_initial, but we need a relationship between V_x and x. Since V_x = A(L_total - x), and if we assume that initially, before the pressure increase, the plunger was in equilibrium, maybe at x_initial = 0? \n\nIf initially, x_initial = 0 (open end at surface), then:\n\n(p₀ + 0)(L_total - 0) = (2p₀ + ρ g x)(L_total - x)\n\n=> p₀ L_total = (2p₀ + ρ g x)(L_total - x)\n\nThis is the same equation I derived earlier. But since V_x = A(L_total - x), we can write L_total - x = V_x / A. Substituting into the equation:\n\np₀ L_total = (2p₀ + ρ g x)(V_x / A)\n\nSolving for V_x:\n\nV_x = [p₀ L_total A] / (2p₀ + ρ g x)\n\nBut L_total and A are constants related to the plunger's dimensions. However, the problem doesn't provide these, so unless we can express L_total in terms of initial conditions, this might not help. \n\nBut if initially, the plunger was at x_initial = 0, then the initial volume was V_initial = A * L_total. Let's call this V_initial = V₀. Then, V_x = V₀ * p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x). \n\nSo, the relationship is V_x = [p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)] * V₀. \n\nBut the problem asks for the relationship between V_x and x. Since V₀ is a constant, this is a valid relationship, but it includes V₀. However, the problem might expect us to leave it in terms of V₀, or maybe there's a way to eliminate V₀ using another condition. \n\nWait, if initially, the plunger was at x_initial = 0, then the initial pressure inside the gas was p₀, and the initial volume was V₀ = A*L_total. If there were no external pressure increase, and the plunger was in equilibrium, then this is consistent. But without additional information, we can't eliminate V₀. \n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify initial conditions, but asks for the relationship between V_x and x, it's possible that the expected answer is simply V_x = k / (2p₀ + ρ g x), where k is a constant, but expressed in terms of the initial state. Since the problem might expect an expression in terms of initial volume, which could be denoted as V₀, then V_x = (p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)) * V₀. \n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't mention V₀, maybe it's assumed that the initial volume is such that when x = 0, V_x = V₀. Therefore, the relationship is V_x = V₀ * p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x). \n\nBut the problem might want it in terms of the sinking depth x without reference to V₀. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sinking depth x is the depth that the plunger has moved from its original position, and the volume change is related to x through the cross-sectional area. For example, if the plunger moves down by x, then the volume decreases by A*x, so V_x = V₀ - A*x. Combining this with Boyle's Law: p₀ V₀ = (2p₀ + ρ g x)(V₀ - A x). \n\nThis would give a quadratic equation in x, but the problem asks for V_x in terms of x, not solving for x. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of additional information, I think the most plausible answer is that, assuming the initial volume V₀ and using Boyle's Law, the relationship is V_x = V₀ * p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x). Since the problem might expect this form, even though V₀ is not specified, it's the only way to relate V_x and x given the information. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the sinking depth x is such that the pressure inside the gas is p = 2p₀ + ρ g x, and since it's an isothermal process, pV = constant, then V_x = constant / (2p₀ + ρ g x). The constant would depend on initial conditions, but since it's not given, this is as far as we can go. \n\nTherefore, the relationship is V_x is inversely proportional to (2p₀ + ρ g x), with the constant of proportionality depending on the initial state. Since the problem asks for the relationship, this might be acceptable. \n\nSo, the final answer is V_x = C / (2p₀ + ρ g x), where C is a constant. But to express it in terms of the initial conditions, if initially at x = 0, the volume was V₀, then C = V₀ * (2p₀ + ρ g * 0) = 2p₀ V₀? No, wait, initially, before the pressure increase, the pressure was p₀, and the volume was V₀. After the pressure increase, the relationship is p₀ V₀ = (2p₀ + ρ g x) V_x, so V_x = (p₀ V₀) / (2p₀ + ρ g x). \n\nYes, this makes sense. Therefore, the relationship is V_x = (p₀ V₀) / (2p₀ + ρ g x). \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify V₀, maybe it's acceptable to leave it as V_x ∝ 1/(2p₀ + ρ g x), or to define V₀ in terms of the plunger's dimensions. However, since the problem mentions the plunger is thin-walled and doesn't give dimensions, it's likely that the expected answer is V_x = (p₀ V_initial) / (2p₀ + ρ g x), where V_initial is the initial volume. \n\nBut since the problem says \"current volume V_x of the gas inside the plunger and the sinking depth x\", and doesn't mention initial volume, maybe there's another approach I'm missing. \n\nWait, let's think about forces. The plunger is in equilibrium, so the force from the gas pressure upwards equals the force from the external pressure downwards plus the weight of the plunger. But the problem says it's thin-walled, so maybe the weight is negligible? If we neglect the weight, then the pressure inside equals the external pressure at the depth of the open end. \n\nSo, p_gas = p_external_at_depth_x = 2p₀ + ρ g x. \n\nSince it's an ideal gas at constant temperature, pV = constant. Let's call this constant K. Therefore, V_x = K / (2p₀ + ρ g x). \n\nBut what is K? Initially, before the pressure increase, the pressure was p_initial = p₀ + ρ g x_initial, and the volume was V_initial, so K = p_initial * V_initial = (p₀ + ρ g x_initial) * V_initial. \n\nBut without knowing x_initial or V_initial, we can't determine K. However, the problem might want the relationship expressed in terms of the current variables, acknowledging that it's inversely proportional to (2p₀ + ρ g x). \n\nSince the problem asks for the relationship, and not the exact function with constants, perhaps the answer is simply V_x ∝ 1/(2p₀ + ρ g x), or more precisely, V_x = constant / (2p₀ + ρ g x). But to write it properly, since it's a physics problem, we need to express it with the constant. \n\nIf we assume that initially, before the pressure increase, the plunger was in equilibrium with p_initial = p₀ + ρ g x_initial and V_initial, then after the pressure increase, the relationship is V_x = [ (p₀ + ρ g x_initial) / (2p₀ + ρ g x) ] * V_initial. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't give x_initial or V_initial, I think the most precise answer we can give, based on the information provided, is V_x = K / (2p₀ + ρ g x), where K is a constant determined by initial conditions. However, since the problem is likely expecting an expression in terms of given quantities, and assuming that initially the plunger was at a depth where the gas volume was such that it could be expressed in terms of the plunger's geometry, but since geometry isn't given, maybe the answer is simply V_x = V_initial * p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x). \n\nGiven that, and since the problem asks for the relationship, I think this is the expected answer, even though V_initial is not specified. \n\nTherefore, the relationship between the current volume V_x and the sinking depth x is V_x is inversely proportional to (2p₀ + ρ g x), with the proportionality constant depending on the initial volume and pressure. \n\nSince the problem is likely expecting an equation, I'll write it as:\n\nV_x = \\frac{p_0 V_0}{2p_0 + \\rho g x}\n\nWhere V_0 is the initial volume of the gas. But since V_0 is not given, maybe it's expressed differently. \n\nWait, another thought: if the plunger is thin-walled, maybe we can assume it's massless and the only force is the pressure balance. Initially, before the pressure increase, the gas pressure was p₀ + ρ g x_initial, and after, it's 2p₀ + ρ g x. Since temperature is constant, pV = constant. But without knowing the initial state, we cannot eliminate the constant. \n\nHowever, the problem says \"when the external pressure suddenly increases from p₀ to 2p₀, the plunger sinks.\" This suggests that initially, the plunger was in equilibrium with the external pressure p₀. So, initially, the pressure inside the gas was equal to p₀ + ρ g x_initial, and after the pressure increase, it becomes 2p₀ + ρ g x. \n\nBut if we assume that initially, the plunger was at some depth x_initial where the gas pressure was p₀ + ρ g x_initial, and after the pressure increase, it moves to a new depth x. The relationship between V_x and x is given by p_initial V_initial = p_final V_x, but we need to relate V_initial and x_initial. \n\nIf we assume that the plunger's volume is related to its depth, like V_initial = A * h_initial, and if the plunger's geometry is such that h_initial = L - x_initial (assuming total length L), then we have V_initial = A(L - x_initial). \n\nBut again, without knowing L, we cannot proceed. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, and considering that in many similar problems, the relationship is derived assuming that initially the plunger was at the surface (x_initial = 0), I'll proceed with that assumption, even though it's an assumption not stated in the problem. \n\nAssuming x_initial = 0, so initially, p_initial = p₀, V_initial = A*L. After the pressure increase, V_x = A(L - x), and p_final = 2p₀ + ρ g x. \n\nBoyle's Law: p_initial V_initial = p_final V_x => p₀ * A*L = (2p₀ + ρ g x) * A*(L - x) => p₀ L = (2p₀ + ρ g x)(L - x). \n\nSolving for L - x, which is h = V_x / A:\n\nL - x = p₀ L / (2p₀ + ρ g x) => V_x / A = p₀ L / (2p₀ + ρ g x) => V_x = (p₀ L / A) * A / (2p₀ + ρ g x) => V_x = (p₀ V_initial / p₀) * p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)? Wait, no. \n\nWait, V_initial = A*L, so p₀ * V_initial = p₀ * A*L. And V_x = A*(L - x). So from above, V_x = [p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)] * A*L = [p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)] * V_initial. \n\nTherefore, V_x = (p₀ / (2p₀ + ρ g x)) * V_initial. \n\nSince the problem asks for the relationship between V_x and x, and if we denote V_initial as the initial volume, this is the relationship. Since the problem doesn't provide V_initial, but asks for the relationship, this is as far as we can go. \n\nTherefore, the answer is V_x is equal to the initial volume multiplied by p₀ divided by (2p₀ + ρ g x). \n\nHowever, since the problem might expect an expression without V_initial, perhaps there is another way. Let me think. If we consider that the sinking depth x is such that the volume change is related to the displacement of the liquid, but without knowing the mass or buoyancy, it's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, if we assume that initially, the plunger was at a depth where the gas volume was such that when the pressure doubled, it sank to a depth x, and the relationship is derived purely from the pressure-volume relationship, then the answer is V_x = K / (2p₀ + ρ g x), where K is a constant. \n\nSince the problem is likely expecting an equation in terms of given quantities, and since p₀, ρ, g are given, but V_initial is not, I think the expected answer is V_x = V_0 * p_0 / (2p_0 + ρ g x), where V_0 is the initial volume. However, since V_0 is not given, maybe it's expressed in terms of the plunger's cross-sectional area and initial length, but since those are not given either, I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the problem's wording, and the common types of problems like this, I think the expected answer is V_x = V_initial * p_0 / (2p_0 + ρ g x), and since the problem says \"find the relationship\", this is acceptable. \n\nSo, the relationship is V_x is inversely proportional to (2p_0 + ρ g x), with the proportionality constant being the initial volume times p_0. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nV_x = \\frac{p_0 V_0}{2p_0 + \\rho g x}\n\nBut since the problem might want it in terms of the current variables without V_0, and given that I might have overcomplicated it, perhaps there's a simpler way. \n\nLet me try one more approach. Let's denote the volume of the gas as V_x, and the sinking depth as x. The pressure inside the gas is p = 2p_0 + ρ g x. Since it's an ideal gas at constant temperature, pV = constant. Let's call this constant C, so V_x = C / (2p_0 + ρ g x). The constant C depends on the initial conditions, but since the problem doesn't specify them, this is as far as we can go. \n\nTherefore, the relationship is V_x = C / (2p_0 + ρ g x). But since the problem asks for the relationship, and not the value of C, this is the answer. However, in physics problems, usually, you express it in terms of given quantities. Since initially, before the pressure increase, the gas had a certain volume and pressure, let's say V_1 and p_1, then C = p_1 V_1. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't give V_1 or p_1, we cannot specify C further. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer expected is V_x = (constant) / (2p_0 + ρ g x), and since the problem is likely from a textbook or exam question, the constant might be expressed in terms of the initial volume, which is often denoted as V_0. \n\nTherefore, I'll conclude that the relationship is V_x = (p_0 V_0) / (2p_0 + ρ g x), where V_0 is the initial volume of the gas. \n\nSince the problem asks for the relationship, and not the exact expression with numerical values, this should be acceptable.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe relationship between the current volume $ V_x $ and the sinking depth $ x $ is given by \\boxed{V_x = \\frac{p_0 V_0}{2p_0 + \\rho g x}}.\n</think>"}
