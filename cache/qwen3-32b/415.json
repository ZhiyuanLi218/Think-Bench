Hmm, let me recall what I know about mirrors and the mirror formula. \n\nFirst, diverging mirrors are also known as convex mirrors, right? They always form virtual images, which are upright and smaller than the object. Since the image is behind the mirror, that makes sense for a convex mirror. \n\nThe mirror formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance. But wait, I need to remember the sign conventions here. Different sources might use different conventions, but I think in the standard convention for mirrors, distances are measured from the mirror's surface. For concave mirrors, the focal length is positive, and for convex (diverging) mirrors, it's negative. \n\nObject distance (u) is usually taken as negative if the object is in front of the mirror, but wait, actually, in the standard sign convention, the object distance for real objects is always positive. Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think again. \n\nIn the Cartesian sign convention, distances to real objects and images are positive, but for mirrors, the direction is different. Wait, actually, for mirrors, the convention is that distances are measured from the mirror's vertex. For concave mirrors, the center of curvature is in front, so positive. For convex mirrors, it's behind, so negative. \n\nWait, maybe I should use the standard sign convention for mirrors where: \n\n- Object distance (u) is positive if the object is in front of the mirror (real object). \n\n- Image distance (v) is positive if the image is in front of the mirror (real image) and negative if behind (virtual image). \n\n- Focal length (f) is positive for concave mirrors and negative for convex mirrors. \n\nYes, that seems right. So since this is a diverging (convex) mirror, the focal length should be negative. \n\nGiven that, the object is placed 10 cm in front of the mirror, so u = +10 cm. The image is 2 cm behind the mirror, which is a virtual image, so v = -2 cm. \n\nSo plugging into the mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. \n\nLet me compute 1/f = 1/(-2) + 1/(10). \n\nCalculating that: 1/f = -0.5 + 0.1 = -0.4 cm⁻¹. \n\nTherefore, f = 1 / (-0.4) = -2.5 cm, which is -5/2 cm. \n\nWait, so the focal length is -5/2 cm? Let me check my steps again. \n\nYes, u is +10 cm because the object is in front. v is -2 cm because the image is behind. \n\nSo 1/f = (-1/2 + 1/10) = (-5/10 + 1/10) = -4/10 = -2/5. Wait, hold on, wait, my previous calculation said -0.5 + 0.1 = -0.4, which is -2/5? Wait, -0.4 is -2/5? Let me verify. \n\nYes, -0.4 is equal to -2/5. Wait, but earlier I thought 1/f was -0.4, which is -2/5, so f is -5/2? Wait, no. Wait, 1/f is -2/5 cm⁻¹, so f is -5/2 cm? Wait, no. Wait, if 1/f = -2/5, then f is -5/2? Let me do the math again. \n\nIf 1/f = -2/5, then f is -5/2. Yes, because reciprocal of -2/5 is -5/2. So f = -5/2 cm, which is -2.5 cm. \n\nLooking at the options, D is -5/2 cm. So the answer should be D. \n\nBut let me double-check with the formula again. Maybe I made an error in signs. \n\nMirror formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. \n\nBut some sources might have different sign conventions. For example, in some conventions, the focal length for convex mirrors is negative, image distance for virtual images is negative. So if u is positive, v is negative, and f is negative. \n\nSo let me plug in the numbers again: \n\n1/f = 1/v + 1/u = 1/(-2) + 1/(10) = (-1/2) + (1/10) = (-5/10 + 1/10) = -4/10 = -2/5. \n\nTherefore, 1/f = -2/5 → f = -5/2 cm. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the focal length is -5/2 cm, which is option D. \n\nBut let me check if I used the right formula. For mirrors, the formula is indeed 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. But sometimes people might use different sign conventions. For example, in some conventions, the formula is 1/f = 1/u - 1/v or something else. Wait, no, the standard mirror formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u with proper signs. \n\nLet me check with an example. Suppose an object is placed in front of a convex mirror. The image is virtual, behind the mirror. So if I have u positive, v negative, and f negative. \n\nYes, so for example, if we take a convex mirror with f = -|f|, then using the formula, we can calculate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the relation that for convex mirrors, the focal length is half the radius of curvature, but since it's convex, it's negative. \n\nBut regardless, the formula gives me f = -5/2 cm. \n\nSo looking at the options, D is -5/2 cm. Therefore, the answer is D. \n\nBut let me check if I messed up the fractions. \n\nOriginal calculation: \n\n1/f = 1/v + 1/u \n\nv = -2 cm \n\nu = +10 cm \n\nSo 1/f = (-1/2) + (1/10) \n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 10: \n\n(-5/10) + (1/10) = -4/10 = -2/5 \n\nTherefore, 1/f = -2/5 \n\nTherefore, f = -5/2 \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the answer is D: -5/2 cm. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
