So, we have Compound X, and we need to identify the final product after it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D. Let me start by analyzing the given IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is, and then see what reaction occurs with red phosphorus and HI.\n\nFirst, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The broad peak from 3400-2500 is probably an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or maybe some kind of hydrogen bonding. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 cm⁻¹ might be a C=C stretch in an aromatic ring. The 1450 cm⁻¹ could be a C-H bending in aliphatic groups or maybe part of the aromatic ring.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data: \n\n- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids typically have a very downfield signal, around 10-12 ppm, so this makes sense. The broad signal is due to exchange with D2O, maybe. So that suggests there's a -COOH group.\n\n- 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's likely aromatic protons. Aromatic protons usually come in multiple peaks. The doublet here could be para to some substituent. For example, if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, the protons adjacent to it might split into a doublet. Since there are two protons, maybe two equivalent protons on the ring.\n\n- 7.2 ppm, doublet, 2H. Similarly, another set of aromatic protons. If we have two doublets each with two protons, that might suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the ortho and meta protons could split into doublets. Wait, but in a para-disubstituted ring, the protons would be equivalent? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. If there's a single substituent on the benzene ring, then the aromatic protons would split into a doublet (ortho) and another doublet (meta)? No, maybe in a meta or para position. Let me recall. For example, toluene has a methyl group, and the aromatic protons are split into a doublet (ortho) and a singlet (para), but actually toluene has three protons in a plane, but maybe with different splitting. Wait, perhaps this is a para-disubstituted ring? Wait, the two doublets each with two protons. If the ring has a substituent that causes the aromatic protons to split into doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would be equivalent? No, if there's only one substituent, then the aromatic protons would have different chemical shifts. Wait, maybe this is a para-substituted ring with another substituent. Let me check the options. The options are all about benzene rings with different substituents. Let's hold that thought.\n\n- 2.9 ppm, multiplet, 1H. That's probably a methine proton (CH), adjacent to some groups. Maybe next to a carbonyl group or part of a chain. \n\n- 1.7 ppm, multiplet, 2H. That could be CH2 group adjacent to the CH mentioned before. \n\n- 1.4 ppm, doublet, 3H. A doublet with 3H is a CH3 group adjacent to a CH (since the CH splits the CH3 into a doublet). \n\n- 0.9 ppm, triplet, 3H. A triplet with 3H is a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2 (which would have two protons, so the CH3 would split into a triplet).\n\nPutting the NMR data together: \n\nThe carboxylic acid proton at 10.5 ppm. Then aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Then there's a CH (2.9 ppm), two CH2 (1.7 ppm?), a CH3 (1.4 ppm), and another CH3 (0.9 ppm). \n\nLet me try to sketch a structure. The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests that the molecule has a COOH group. The aromatic protons suggest a benzene ring substituted with something. The other protons suggest aliphatic chains attached to the aromatic ring. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So this is propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. The structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position. \n\nB: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Benzoic acid (COOH directly attached to benzene) with a sec-butyl group in the para position. Sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), so the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position.\n\nC: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. This is a benzene ring with an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. No COOH group here, so probably not C or D because the IR has a COOH.\n\nD: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Similar to C but with a sec-butyl group. Again, no COOH, so not D.\n\nSo options A and B are benzoic acid derivatives. Let's check which one fits the NMR data.\n\nFirst, for option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The structure would be:\n\nPh-CH2CH2-COOH, where Ph is a 4-ethylphenyl group. Wait, no, the propanoic acid part is the 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the propanoic acid would be CH2CH2COOH? Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to a 4-ethylphenyl group. Wait, but the position is 2. So the propanoic acid is at position 2 of the phenyl group. Wait, maybe the phenyl is attached to the CH2 of the propanoic acid? Let me clarify.\n\nThe compound is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The propanoic acid part is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-(4-ethylphenyl) would mean that the phenyl group is attached at the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure would be:\n\nCH2(Ph)CH2COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl. So the propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the first CH2 has a phenyl group attached. Wait, the IUPAC name would be propanoic acid with a phenyl group at the second carbon. So the structure is:\n\nPh-CH2-CH2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl. So the phenyl is para to an ethyl group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phenyl is attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. Let me draw it as:\n\nCH2-Ph-CH2-COOH. Wait, but propanoic acid is three carbons. So the propanoic acid is CH2-CH2-COOH. If the phenyl is attached to the second carbon, it would be CH2-Ph-CH2-COOH? Wait, that would be four carbons. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check the correct structure.\n\nThe correct structure for 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be:\n\nThe propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2 position is the middle carbon (since propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, the carbons are 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (COOH)). So attaching the 4-ethylphenyl group to the second carbon would give CH2(Ph)CH2COOH. So the structure is:\n\nCH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH. The phenyl group is para-ethyl. So the aromatic ring has an ethyl group in the para position relative to the phenyl group attached to the propanoic acid.\n\nNow, for option B: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. The sec-butyl group is attached at the para position. The structure would be:\n\nThe benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), which is 2-butyl. So the sec-butyl group is attached to the benzene ring.\n\nSo comparing the two options, A and B. Let's see which one fits the NMR data.\n\nStarting with option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.\n\nThe aromatic protons would be part of the 4-ethylphenyl group. The ethyl group is para to the phenyl group attached to the propanoic acid. The aromatic protons would have two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. That could be due to the aromatic ring with two substituents. Wait, but in this case, the aromatic ring has an ethyl group and the phenyl group attached to the propanoic acid. Wait, no, the 4-ethylphenyl group is attached to the propanoic acid. So the aromatic ring has an ethyl group in the para position relative to the point of attachment. So the aromatic ring would have one substituent (the ethyl group) and the phenyl group is attached to the propanoic acid. Wait, no. The phenyl group is part of the 4-ethylphenyl. So the aromatic ring has an ethyl group in the para position and the rest of the ring's protons.\n\nIn that case, the aromatic protons would have two doublets. For example, in a para-substituted benzene ring with a single substituent (like ethyl), the aromatic protons would typically show a singlet? No, wait. If the ring has only one substituent (ethyl in para position?), no, a single substituent would be in one position, but para would require another substituent. Wait, confusion here. Let me think again. If the aromatic ring is 4-ethylphenyl, that means the ethyl group is in the para position relative to the point where the phenyl group is attached to the propanoic acid. So the aromatic ring has an ethyl group at para position. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions. For example, in a monosubstituted benzene ring with a substituent in the para position, the aromatic protons would have two equivalent sets: two protons ortho and two protons meta. But depending on the substituent, their chemical shifts would differ. However, if the substituent is para to the attachment point, then the aromatic protons would have two doublets? Wait, maybe not. Let me recall the splitting patterns. For a monosubstituted benzene ring (e.g., toluene), the aromatic protons are in different positions. But if there's a para-substituent, the splitting is more complex. Wait, perhaps in this case, the aromatic ring has an ethyl group in the para position, so the protons would be split into two doublets. For example, if the ring has a para-ethyl group, then the aromatic protons adjacent to the ethyl (ortho) would be in a different chemical shift than those opposite (meta), but since it's para, the symmetry might make them equivalent? No, in a para-substituted benzene ring, the protons are in two equivalent sets. Wait, actually, if there's a single substituent in the para position, the ring has two equivalent protons in the ortho and two equivalent in the meta. For example, in para-xylene, but that's two substituents. Wait, if there's only one substituent, like para-ethylbenzene (which is actually impossible, because a single substituent can't be in para to itself). Wait, no, if the substituent is at position 1, then para is position 4. So the aromatic ring has a substituent at position 4. Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho) would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 (meta) would be equivalent. So their NMR would show two doublets if there's some splitting. But in reality, the protons at ortho and meta positions would have different chemical shifts. However, if there's no coupling, they might appear as two singlets. But in the given data, we have two doublets each with 2H. So maybe each set of protons (ortho and meta) is split into a doublet by some other protons. But in a monosubstituted benzene ring, the protons are not coupled to each other because they are all equivalent in a way? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's move to option B.\n\nOption B: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure is benzoic acid (COOH directly attached to the benzene ring) with a sec-butyl group in the para position. The aromatic ring would have the COOH group and the sec-butyl group in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to these substituents. The COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the sec-butyl is a bulky group. The aromatic protons would again have two sets. If the ring has two substituents (COOH and sec-butyl) in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions. However, if the substituents are para to each other, then the ring would have two substituents, leading to different splitting patterns. But in this case, the benzoic acid has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and 3 and 5 (meta to COOH), but since there's a sec-butyl in position 4 (para to COOH), the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOH and the sec-butyl? Wait, no. Let me draw it:\n\nBenzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4 (para to COOH). Then positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to both COOH and the sec-butyl group? No, position 2 is adjacent to COOH (position 1) and position 3. The sec-butyl is at position 4. So position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (COOH) and position 3. Position 4 (sec-butyl) is adjacent to positions 3 and 5. So the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be influenced by the COOH group and the sec-butyl group? Maybe their chemical shifts would be different. However, in the NMR, we have two doublets each with 2H. If the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, that might suggest coupling between adjacent protons. For example, in a para-disubstituted ring, but here it's a meta and para? Hmm.\n\nBut let's compare the NMR data. The key is to figure out the aliphatic protons. Let's look at the aliphatic part. The NMR has a CH (2.9 ppm), two CH2 (1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm?), and a CH3 (1.4 ppm). \n\nFor option A: the propanoic acid part is CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a phenyl group attached at the CH2. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH. So the propanoic acid is CH2-CH2-COOH with the first CH2 having a phenyl group. So the protons would be:\n\n- The CH2 adjacent to the phenyl group (CH2-Ph). This CH2 would be next to the aromatic ring. Then the next CH2 (CH2-COOH). Then the COOH.\n\nSo the protons would be:\n\n- The CH2 next to the aromatic ring: maybe around 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H)? Wait, no, it's a CH2 group. Wait, the NMR has a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That suggests a CH proton. So maybe there's a CH group in the structure. Let's check.\n\nOption A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The propanoic acid is CH2-CH2-COOH, with the first CH2 attached to the 4-ethylphenyl group. So the structure is:\n\nPh-CH2-CH2-COOH. The protons would be:\n\n- The aromatic protons (already discussed).\n\n- The CH2 adjacent to the phenyl group (Ph-CH2-...). This CH2 would be at a higher chemical shift, maybe around 2.5-3.0 ppm. \n\n- The next CH2 (CH2-COOH). This would be adjacent to the carbonyl group, so the protons might be around 2.0-2.5 ppm, but depending on the splitting.\n\nBut in the NMR data, there's a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That suggests a single proton, so maybe a CH group. So maybe the structure has a CH group. Let's look at option B: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? Or is it CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3? No. Let me clarify the structure of sec-butyl. The sec-butyl group is the secondary butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. The correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 is n-butyl. The sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)? Wait, no. Let me recall. The butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The sec-butyl is when the point of attachment is on a secondary carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 is n-butyl. The sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) is isobutyl? Wait, no. Let me look it up mentally. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2CH2CH2CH3 is n-butyl. The sec-butyl is when the central carbon is attached to two other carbons. For example, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) would be isobutyl. Wait, no. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon: -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes sec-butyl as -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's n-butyl. To make it sec-butyl, the point of attachment is on a secondary carbon. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 but attached at the middle carbon. So the correct structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No. Let me think. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the point of attachment is on the second carbon: -CH2-CH(-CH2CH3). Wait, no. If the point of attachment is on the second carbon, then the structure would be CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3 where R is the point of attachment. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: the sec-butyl group is the second carbon of the butyl chain. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3, where R is the point of attachment. Therefore, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the R on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. Therefore, when attached to a benzene ring, the sec-butyl group would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that would be isobutyl. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The sec-butyl group is also known as 1-methylpropyl. The structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. Therefore, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the R on the second carbon. Therefore, the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the R on the second carbon. Therefore, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. Therefore, the structure is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. So when R is attached to the benzene ring, the sec-butyl group would look like -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me think of the sec-butyl group as having the formula C4H9. The sec-butyl group is one of the isomers of butyl. The possible isomers are:\n\n- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3\n\n- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)\n\n- isobutyl: CH2CH(CH3)CH2-\n\n- tert-butyl: C(CH3)3\n\nWait, no, the sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the R on the second carbon. Therefore, the sec-butyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the R on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. Therefore, when attached to a benzene ring, the sec-butyl group would have a CH2 group attached to the ring, followed by a CH2 group, then another CH2 group and a CH3. Wait, no. If the point of attachment is on the second carbon, then the structure is R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So the sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. Therefore, the sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. So when attached to a benzene ring (R is the ring), the group is -CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. Therefore, the structure would be a benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH group (which is attached to another CH2 and CH3). \n\nBut let's go back to the NMR data. The NMR has:\n\n- 10.5 ppm (COOH)\n\n- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\n\n- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)\n\n- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)\n\n- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)\n\n- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)\n\n- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)\n\nSo there are four aliphatic groups: a CH (2.9), two CH2 (1.7 and 0.9), a CH3 (1.4), and another CH3 (0.9). \n\nLooking at option B: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The sec-butyl group would have the following protons:\n\nAssuming the sec-butyl is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3, where R is the benzene ring. So the protons would be:\n\n- The CH2 adjacent to the ring (CH2-): this would be near the ring, maybe around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n\n- The CH (CH(R)): attached to the ring and a CH2. This would be a CH proton, maybe around 1.4-2.0 ppm.\n\n- The CH2 next to the CH: this would be adjacent to the CH, so maybe around 1.2-1.6 ppm.\n\n- The CH3 at the end: this would be a triplet at around 0.9 ppm.\n\nBut the NMR data has a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) which is a CH proton. If the sec-butyl group has a CH proton, that could fit. Then the CH2 next to the CH would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), the CH3 next to that CH2 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), and another CH3? Wait, the sec-butyl group is four carbons long. If the structure is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3, then the protons would be:\n\n- CH2 (attached to ring): maybe around 2.5 ppm (but in the data it's 2.9 ppm, which is higher, maybe due to being adjacent to the ring and some deshielding).\n\n- CH (attached to ring and CH2): around 1.4 ppm (doublet if adjacent to CH2, but the data has a multiplet).\n\n- CH2 adjacent to CH: around 1.7 ppm (multiplet).\n\n- CH3: triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n\nBut in the data, there's also a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (doublet). That suggests another CH3 group adjacent to a CH. If the sec-butyl group has a CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3 structure, then there's only one CH3 group at the end. So where does the other CH3 come from? Maybe the ethyl group in option A? Let's check option A again.\n\nOption A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The propanoic acid part is CH2-CH2-COOH with a phenyl group attached at the first CH2. The 4-ethylphenyl group means the aromatic ring has an ethyl group in the para position. The ethyl group would contribute a CH2 and a CH3. Let's see:\n\nThe ethyl group on the aromatic ring would have a CH2 (attached to the ring) and a CH3. The NMR would show:\n\n- The CH2 attached to the ring: maybe around 2.5-3.0 ppm (multiplet, 2H)\n\n- The CH3 of the ethyl group: triplet at around 1.2 ppm (but in the data we have 1.4 ppm as a doublet for 3H). Hmm, not matching directly. \n\nBut the propanoic acid part would have a CH2 adjacent to the aromatic ring (maybe around 2.5-3.0 ppm), then another CH2 adjacent to the COOH (maybe around 2.0-2.5 ppm). However, the NMR data has a single CH proton at 2.9 ppm, not a CH2. So this suggests that option A might not have a CH proton, unless there's another group.\n\nWait, the propanoic acid in option A is CH2-CH2-COOH. So two CH2 groups. If the first CH2 is attached to the aromatic ring, then the protons would be CH2 (attached to ring) and CH2 (attached to COOH). But these would be CH2 groups, not a CH. So why is there a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) in the NMR? That suggests a CH proton. Therefore, option A might not be the correct structure for Compound X. \n\nOn the other hand, option B has a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group has a CH proton. If the sec-butyl is attached to the benzene ring, then the structure would have a CH proton. Let me think again about the sec-butyl group. If the sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), then the protons would be:\n\n- The CH2 attached to the ring: maybe around 2.0 ppm.\n\n- The CH (CH(CH2CH3)): around 1.4 ppm (doublet if adjacent to a CH2).\n\n- The CH2 adjacent to the CH: around 1.7 ppm (multiplet).\n\n- The CH3 at the end: triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n\nBut there's also a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H) in the NMR data. Where would that come from? If the sec-butyl group has a CH(CH2CH3), then the CH2CH3 part would be a CH2 and a CH3. But in that case, the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, leading to the CH2 protons being a multiplet and the CH3 protons being a triplet. However, in the data, there's a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (doublet). This suggests that there's a CH3 group adjacent to a CH group (since the CH splits the CH3 into a doublet). If the sec-butyl group has a CH(CH2CH3), then the CH2CH3 would be a CH2 adjacent to the CH, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So maybe there's another CH3 group in the structure. Wait, the benzoic acid part doesn't have any CH3 groups. Unless the sec-butyl group has another CH3. Let me think. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). The CH2CH3 is an ethyl group? No, the CH2CH3 is a CH2 and a CH3. Wait, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. Therefore, the sec-butyl group has a CH2 attached to R (the benzene ring), then a CH group attached to another CH2, and then a CH3. So the protons would be:\n\n- CH2 (attached to R): maybe around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n\n- CH (attached to CH2 and CH2): around 1.4-1.6 ppm (doublet if adjacent to CH2).\n\n- CH2 (attached to CH and CH3): around 1.2-1.5 ppm (multiplet).\n\n- CH3: triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n\nBut in the NMR data, there's also a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (doublet). This suggests another CH3 group adjacent to a CH. If the sec-butyl group has a CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3 structure, then there's only one CH3 group at the end. So where is the other CH3? Maybe there's a methyl group on the aromatic ring? But in option B, it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The benzoic acid has a COOH group directly on the ring, and the sec-butyl in the para position. There's no other methyl group on the ring. So maybe this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, let's go back to the options. The options are A and B for benzoic acid derivatives. Let me try to count the protons in the NMR for each option.\n\nFor option B (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid):\n\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each with 2H.\n\n- The sec-butyl group: CH2 (attached to ring), CH, CH2, CH3.\n\n- The benzoic acid COOH: 10.5 ppm.\n\nSo the aliphatic protons would be:\n\n- CH2 (attached to ring): 2H.\n\n- CH: 1H.\n\n- CH2: 2H.\n\n- CH3: 3H.\n\nPlus the COOH.\n\nIn the NMR data, we have:\n\n- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely the CH.\n\n- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): likely the CH2 adjacent to CH.\n\n- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): this is a CH3 adjacent to a CH (since the CH splits it into a doublet). But in the sec-butyl group, the CH3 is at the end, adjacent to a CH2, which would make it a triplet, not a doublet. Unless there's another CH3 group. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. If the sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3, then the CH3 is adjacent to a CH2, so the CH3 protons would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2 (which has two protons). The CH2 adjacent to the CH would have two protons, splitting the CH into a triplet? No, the CH has one proton, so the adjacent CH2 would split the CH proton into a triplet (since n+1, where n is the number of adjacent protons). But in the data, the CH is a multiplet (m), which could be due to coupling with multiple protons. The CH2 adjacent to the CH would split the CH into a triplet, and if there are other couplings, it might appear as a multiplet. The CH2 adjacent to the CH would be split by the CH (1H) into a doublet, but since it's a CH2, it would actually be split into a doublet of doublets if there are other couplings. However, in the data, we have a 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be the CH2 adjacent to the CH. \n\nBut the CH3 at the end of the sec-butyl group would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). The data also has a 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which matches. Then where is the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? This suggests another CH3 group adjacent to a CH. If the sec-butyl group doesn't have another CH3, maybe the benzoic acid has another group? No, in option B, it's just the sec-butyl and the COOH. So this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the structure of the sec-butyl group. Let me think again. The sec-butyl group is also known as the secondary butyl group. Its structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. Therefore, the group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the R on the second carbon. Wait, no, that would be the same as n-butyl. To make it sec-butyl, the point of attachment must be on a secondary carbon. So the correct structure is CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. So when R is attached to the benzene ring, the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. Therefore, the protons are:\n\n- CH2 (attached to R): 2H.\n\n- CH (attached to R and CH2): 1H.\n\n- CH2 (attached to CH and CH3): 2H.\n\n- CH3: 3H.\n\nSo the NMR would have:\n\n- The CH2 attached to the ring: maybe around 2.0-2.5 ppm (multiplet, 2H).\n\n- The CH: around 1.4 ppm (doublet if adjacent to CH2, but likely a multiplet due to coupling with both adjacent CH2 and the CH2).\n\n- The CH2 adjacent to CH: around 1.2-1.5 ppm (multiplet, 2H).\n\n- The CH3: triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).\n\nBut the data has a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). This suggests another CH3 group adjacent to a CH. Unless there's a methyl group on the aromatic ring, but option B doesn't have that. So this doesn't fit. \n\nLet's go back to option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The structure is CH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl. The Ph group has an ethyl group in the para position. The ethyl group would have a CH2 (attached to the ring) and a CH3. The propanoic acid part has two CH2 groups. \n\nSo the aliphatic protons would be:\n\n- The CH2 attached to the aromatic ring (Ph-CH2-...): 2H.\n\n- The CH2 adjacent to COOH: 2H.\n\n- The ethyl group on the aromatic ring: CH2 (attached to ring) and CH3.\n\nBut where is the CH proton at 2.9 ppm? This suggests there's a CH group in the structure. Neither the propanoic acid part (which has CH2 groups) nor the ethyl group (which has CH2 and CH3) has a CH group. So this suggests that option A doesn't have a CH proton, which conflicts with the NMR data. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the structure of option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2 position is the CH2 attached to the aromatic ring. So the structure is:\n\nPh-CH2-CH2-COOH. The protons would be:\n\n- Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH.\n\nThe CH2 adjacent to the aromatic ring (Ph-CH2-) would have protons around 2.5-3.0 ppm. The next CH2 (CH2-COOH) would have protons around 2.0-2.5 ppm. The COOH proton at 10.5 ppm. The aromatic protons as two doublets. The ethyl group on the aromatic ring would contribute a CH2 (attached to the ring) and a CH3. \n\nSo the aliphatic protons would be:\n\n- Ph-CH2-: 2H at around 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n\n- CH2-COOH: 2H at around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n\n- Ethyl group on the ring: CH2 (attached to ring) and CH3.\n\nBut the NMR data has a CH proton at 2.9 ppm. This suggests that there's a CH group in the structure, which isn't present in option A. Therefore, option A might not be correct. \n\nWait, unless the propanoic acid part is different. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the structure should be CH3-CH2-COOH. But in option A, it's 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which would mean the phenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Propanoic acid has three carbons: CH3-CH2-COOH. The second carbon is CH2. So attaching the phenyl group to the second carbon would give CH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH? Wait, that would be four carbons. No, the propanoic acid has three carbons. Attaching the phenyl to the second carbon would give CH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH, but that's four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write it out:\n\nPropanoic acid: CH3-CH2-COOH.\n\nThe second carbon is CH2. Attaching the phenyl group to the second carbon would give CH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH? No, that would require adding a phenyl to the CH2, making it CH2-Ph-CH2-COOH. But that would be four carbons: CH2 (phenyl), CH2, COOH. Wait, but the propanoic acid is three carbons. So attaching the phenyl to the second carbon would give CH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH, which is four carbons. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-Ph-CH2-COOH, where the phenyl is attached to the first CH2, making it a butanoic acid? No, the name is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. This suggests that the propanoic acid is the parent chain, and the phenyl group is at the second carbon. Therefore, the correct structure should be CH2(Ph)-CH2-COOH, which is four carbons. This inconsistency suggests that maybe option A is not the correct structure. \n\nGiven this confusion, let's try to approach it differently. The NMR has a CH proton at 2.9 ppm, a CH2 at 1.7 ppm, a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (doublet), and a CH3 at 0.9 ppm (triplet). This suggests a sec-butyl group: the CH, CH2, and two CH3 groups. The sec-butyl group has the structure CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, the sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the R on the second carbon. Therefore, the group is -CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3. So the protons are:\n\n- CH2 attached to R: 2H.\n\n- CH(R): 1H.\n\n- CH2 adjacent to CH: 2H.\n\n- CH3: 3H.\n\nThis matches the NMR data if the CH is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), the CH2 adjacent to CH is at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH3 is at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The other CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is confusing. Unless there's another CH3 group in the structure. Wait, maybe the aromatic ring has a methyl group? But in option B, it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which doesn't have a methyl group on the ring. However, if there's a methyl group on the aromatic ring, that would add a CH3. But option B doesn't have that. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the structure of the sec-butyl group. Let me consider the possibility that the sec-butyl group is actually an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that would have a CH2 and a CH(CH2CH3). The protons would be:\n\n- CH2 attached to the ring: around 2.0 ppm.\n\n- CH(CH2CH3): around 1.4 ppm (doublet if adjacent to CH2).\n\n- CH2CH3: around 1.0 ppm (triplet).\n\nBut this would give a CH3 at 1.0 ppm (triplet) and a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (doublet). This matches the NMR data: 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). So if the sec-butyl group is actually an isobutyl group, then this fits. But sec-butyl and isobutyl are different. Wait, is there confusion between sec-butyl and isobutyl? Yes, sometimes people get confused between them. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3). No, the correct structure for isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the isobutyl group is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Wait, no. The isobutyl group is the isomer of butyl where the point of attachment is on a branch. The correct structure for isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, the correct structure for isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) is actually the same as sec-butyl. Wait, I think I'm getting tangled up here. Let me recall:\n\n- n-butyl: straight chain, -CH2CH2CH2CH3.\n\n- sec-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the point of attachment on the second carbon, so -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes -CH2-CH(R)-CH2-CH3.\n\n- isobutyl: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure for isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) is actually the same as sec-butyl. I think I'm stuck here. Let's try to think of the protons in the NMR data. \n\nThe NMR has a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and a CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). This suggests a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 structure, where the CH3 at 1.4 ppm is adjacent to a CH group, and the CH3 at 0.9 ppm is adjacent to a CH2 group. This is the structure of isobutyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, the correct structure is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? I think I need to look up the correct structure mentally. \n\nThe isobutyl group is one of the isomers of butyl, where the point of attachment is on a branch. The structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) is actually the same as sec-butyl. I'm getting confused. Let's think about the splitting patterns. The CH3 at 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which suggests it's adjacent to a CH group (n+1=2, so n=1). The CH3 at 0.9 ppm is a triplet, adjacent to a CH2 group. This suggests the structure is CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that's isobutyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, that would be sec-butyl. Wait, if the structure is CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3, then the CH2CH3 is attached to the CH group. But this is getting too complicated. Let me try to draw it:\n\nIf there's a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3, and another CH3 adjacent to a CH2, it would look like:\n\nCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. But this is actually the structure of 2-methylpropane, which is not correct. Wait, no. Let me think of it as a branch. If there's a central carbon (CH) attached to a CH2CH3, a CH2, and a CH3. This would be CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3, which is 3-methylpentane? No, this is getting too complex. \n\nAlternatively, the structure could be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is the sec-butyl group. The protons would be:\n\n- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2H.\n\n- The CH(CH2CH3): 1H.\n\n- The CH2 adjacent to the CH: 2H.\n\n- The CH3 at the end: 3H.\n\nBut where is the other CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? This suggests there's another CH3 group adjacent to a CH. If the sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH2CH3 is a CH2 attached to a CH3. So the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH and the CH3. The CH2 protons would be split by both the CH and the CH3. This might result in a multiplet. The CH3 at the end of the CH2CH3 would be a triplet. But where is the CH3 at 1.4 ppm? Maybe the CH2CH3 is actually a CH(CH3)CH2-? No, I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the confusion, let's try to make an educated guess. The NMR data has a CH proton at 2.9 ppm, which suggests a CH group. This is present in option B (sec-butyl group) but not in option A (which has only CH2 groups). Therefore, Compound X is likely option B: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. \n\nNow, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Barton decarboxylation or some other reaction? Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the conversion of carboxylic acids to alkanes via the Hunsdiecker reaction. In the Hunsdiecker reaction, a silver salt of a carboxylic acid is treated with bromine and red phosphorus to form an alkyl bromide. But here it's HI instead of HBr. Alternatively, it could be a decarboxylation reaction. \n\nWait, another possibility: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo a reduction or some substitution. For example, the carboxylic acid could be reduced to an alkane. The general reaction for the Hunsdiecker reaction is RCOOH + Br2 + P → RBr + CO2 + HPO3. But with HI instead of HBr, it might form RI. However, the question is about the final product. \n\nIf Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option B), then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would likely convert the benzoic acid group into an alkyl iodide via the Hunsdiecker reaction. The benzoic acid (COOH) would be converted to an iodide (I) on the carbon adjacent to where the COOH was. Wait, no, the Hunsdiecker reaction converts the carboxylic acid to an alkyl halide by cleaving the carbon chain. For example, RCOOH would become RI, losing CO2. But in this case, the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the benzene ring. So the reaction would convert the benzoic acid into a phenyl iodide. But the phenyl group is attached to the ring. Wait, if the carboxylic acid is on the benzene ring, then the Hunsdiecker reaction would remove the COOH group and replace it with an iodide on the same carbon. So the benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) would become C6H5I. But in our case, the carboxylic acid is part of the 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)iodobenzene. \n\nBut looking at the options, none of them are iodobenzenes. The options are A-D, which are all hydrocarbons with different substituents. Wait, the question says \"Identify the final product\" after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The options are all organic compounds without iodide. This suggests that maybe the reaction is not the Hunsdiecker reaction, or that there's another step involved. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction could be a reduction of the carboxylic acid. Red phosphorus and HI might reduce the carboxylic acid to an alkane. For example, the COOH group could be reduced to a CH2 group. If that's the case, then 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene? No, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, if the COOH is reduced to CH2, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene? No, because the original compound is benzoic acid, so reducing COOH to CH3 would give toluene with a sec-butyl group. But option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is exactly that: a benzene ring with a sec-butyl at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. But in the original compound, the COOH is on the benzene ring, so reducing it to CH3 would add a methyl group at that position. If the original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the COOH is at position 1 (assuming the sec-butyl is at position 4), so reducing it would give 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI could reduce the COOH to a CH3 group. This is possible through a series of reductions, though typically, the reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes is done with more vigorous conditions, like HI and red phosphorus. \n\nTherefore, if Compound X is option B (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), then the product after reaction would be option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has the COOH directly attached to the benzene ring at position 1 (assuming the sec-butyl is at position 4). Reducing the COOH to CH3 would give a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4, which is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Yes, that matches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
