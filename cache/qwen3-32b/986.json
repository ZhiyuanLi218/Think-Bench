The reaction is often used in the lab to generate SO₂ gas.\n\n---\n\n### **Oxidation States of Sulfur**\n\nLet’s examine the oxidation states of sulfur in the compounds involved:\n\n- **H₂SO₄**: Sulfur is in the +6 oxidation state.\n- **Na₂SO₃**: Sulfur is in the +4 oxidation state.\n- **Na₂SO₄**: Sulfur is again in the +6 oxidation state.\n- **SO₂**: Sulfur is in the +4 oxidation state.\n\nFrom this, we observe that:\n\n- Sulfur in **Na₂SO₃** goes from +4 to +6 in **Na₂SO₄** (oxidation).\n- Sulfur in **Na₂SO₃** also remains at +4 in **SO₂** (no change).\n- Sulfur in **H₂SO₄** remains at +6 in **Na₂SO₄** (no change).\n\nThus, **only part of the sulfite is oxidized**, but **no reduction** occurs in the sulfur from H₂SO₄. This means the reaction **is not a redox reaction**—it is primarily an **acid-base reaction with gas evolution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's now assess the correctness of each option:\n\n#### **(A) H₂SO₄ is an oxidizing agent in this reaction**\n\n- This is **incorrect**. As shown above, the sulfur in H₂SO₄ remains at +6 throughout the reaction. Since there is no reduction of sulfur or any other element from H₂SO₄, it **does not act as an oxidizing agent**.\n- The reaction is **not redox**, and H₂SO₄ is acting as a **strong acid**, providing H⁺ ions to drive the reaction forward.\n\n#### **(B) Na₂SO₃ is easily oxidized by O₂ in the air and deteriorates**\n\n- This is **correct**. Sodium sulfite is **prone to oxidation** by atmospheric oxygen to form sodium sulfate:\n  $$\n  2\\mathrm{Na}_2\\mathrm{SO}_3 + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{Na}_2\\mathrm{SO}_4\n  $$\n- Hence, it **deteriorates over time** when exposed to air.\n\n#### **(C) Na₂SO₄ is an ionic compound containing covalent bonds**\n\n- This is **correct**.

The **sulfate ion itself contains covalent bonds** between sulfur and oxygen atoms.\n\n#### **(D) SO₂ is the main harmful pollutant causing acid rain**\n\n- This is **correct**.

Let me start by breaking down each part of the question and analyzing the options one by one.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each of the substances involved is and what their roles might be in the reaction. The reaction given is between sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and sodium sulfite (Na₂SO₃), producing sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄), sulfur dioxide gas (SO₂), and water (H₂O). \n\nI think the key here is to determine the oxidation states of sulfur in each compound to see if there's a redox reaction occurring, which would help in identifying oxidizing agents and reducing agents. Let me jot down the oxidation states of sulfur in each compound:\n\n1. H₂SO₄: Sulfuric acid. The sulfate ion is SO₄²⁻. Let's calculate the oxidation state of sulfur here. Oxygen is -2 each, so total from oxygen is 4*(-2) = -8. The overall charge is -2, so sulfur must be +6 because -8 + S = -2 → S = +6.\n\n2. Na₂SO₃: Sodium sulfite. The sulfite ion is SO₃²⁻. Oxygen is -2 each, so 3*(-2) = -6. Total charge is -2, so sulfur is +4. Because -6 + S = -2 → S = +4.\n\n3. Na₂SO₄: Sodium sulfate. Same as the sulfate ion again. So sulfur here is +6, same as in H₂SO₄.\n\n4. SO₂: Sulfur dioxide. Oxygen is -2 each, two oxygens so total -4. Since the molecule is neutral, sulfur is +4. Wait, no. Wait, sulfur dioxide is SO₂. Let me recalculate. Oxygen is -2 each. Let me call sulfur's oxidation state x. x + 2*(-2) = 0 → x -4 = 0 → x = +4. So sulfur is +4 here.\n\nSo, looking at the oxidation states of sulfur in the reactants and products:\n\nIn the reactants: H₂SO₄ has S at +6, Na₂SO₃ has S at +4.\n\nIn the products: Na₂SO₄ has S at +6 (so no change from H₂SO₄), and SO₂ has S at +4 (same as in Na₂SO₃). Wait, so sulfur in Na₂SO₃ is going from +4 to +4 in SO₂? That seems like no change? Or maybe I need to look at all the sulfur atoms involved.\n\nWait, the reaction is H₂SO₄ + Na₂SO₃ → Na₂SO₄ + SO₂↑ + H₂O. Let me write the balanced equation first to make sure. Let me check if the equation is balanced as written. Let's see:\n\nLeft side: H₂SO₄ and Na₂SO₃.\n\nRight side: Na₂SO₄, SO₂, H₂O.\n\nLet me count each element:\n\nSulfur: Left side: 1 (from H₂SO₄) + 1 (from Na₂SO₃) = 2 sulfurs. Right side: 1 (in Na₂SO₄) + 1 (in SO₂) = 2. So sulfur is balanced.\n\nSodium: Left side: 2 (from Na₂SO₃). Right side: 2 (from Na₂SO₄). Balanced.\n\nHydrogen: Left side: 2 (from H₂SO₄). Right side: 2 (from H₂O). Balanced.\n\nOxygen: Let's see. Left side: 4 (from H₂SO₄) + 3 (from Na₂SO₃) = 7 oxygens. Right side: 4 (from Na₂SO₄) + 2 (from SO₂) + 1 (from H₂O) = 7. So oxygen is balanced. So the equation is balanced as written. Okay.\n\nNow, looking at the oxidation states of sulfur. Let me track each sulfur atom:\n\nIn H₂SO₄, sulfur is +6. In Na₂SO₄, sulfur is also +6. So that sulfur didn't change oxidation state. In Na₂SO₃ (sulfite), sulfur is +4. Then in SO₂, sulfur is also +4. So that sulfur didn't change either? Wait, but that can't be. If there's no change in oxidation states, then it's not a redox reaction? But the question is talking about oxidizing agents and such, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the entire reaction. Let me check again. Let me write the reaction with oxidation states:\n\nH₂SO₄ (S +6) + Na₂SO₃ (S +4) → Na₂SO₄ (S +6) + SO₂ (S +4) + H₂O.\n\nSo sulfur from H₂SO₄ remains at +6. Sulfur from Na₂SO₃ is +4, and in the products, some of it goes to +6 in Na₂SO₄ and some stays at +4 in SO₂. Wait, no. Wait, the Na₂SO₃ is split into Na₂SO₄ and SO₂. So one sulfur atom from Na₂SO₃ is going to Na₂SO₄ (oxidized to +6) and another sulfur atom is going to SO₂ (remains at +4)? But that doesn't make sense because there's only one sulfur in Na₂SO₃. Wait, perhaps I need to think about the actual reaction mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a redox reaction here. Let me think. If Na₂SO₃ is reacting with H₂SO₄ to produce Na₂SO₄ and SO₂, then perhaps the sulfite is acting as a reducing agent. Let me check oxidation states again.\n\nIn Na₂SO₃, the sulfur is +4. In Na₂SO₄, the sulfur is +6. So that's an oxidation (increase in oxidation state). Therefore, Na₂SO₃ is being oxidized to Na₂SO₄. But then, where is the reduction happening? Because if something is oxidized, something else must be reduced.\n\nLooking at H₂SO₄, sulfur is +6. In the products, sulfur is in Na₂SO₄ (still +6) and in SO₂ (which is +4). So the sulfur in H₂SO₄ is not changing, but the sulfur in Na₂SO₃ is going to both Na₂SO₄ (oxidized) and SO₂ (same as original? Wait, no. Wait, in the Na₂SO₃, sulfur is +4. In the product SO₂, sulfur is also +4. So that part is not changing. But the other part, the Na₂SO₃ is being oxidized to Na₂SO₄. So perhaps only part of the sulfur is oxidized? But how?\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is that H₂SO₄ is acting as an acid, protonating the sulfite ion, and then the sulfite is acting as a reducing agent, causing the sulfuric acid to be reduced? Wait, but sulfuric acid's sulfur is already at +6. How can it be reduced? Unless there's another component.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a redox reaction where Na₂SO₃ is oxidized and H₂SO₄ is reduced. Let me check if there's any change in oxidation states for other elements. For example, maybe hydrogen or oxygen? But H and O are usually not involved in redox reactions unless in specific cases. Let me check:\n\nHydrogen in H₂SO₄ is +1, and remains +1 in H₂O. Oxygen in H₂SO₄ is -2, same as in H₂O and SO₂. Sodium is +1 in Na₂SO₃ and remains +1 in Na₂SO₄. So the only element changing oxidation state is sulfur. But how?\n\nWait, in Na₂SO₃, sulfur is +4. In the products, some of it goes to +6 (in Na₂SO₄) and some stays at +4 (in SO₂). So the oxidation state of sulfur in Na₂SO₃ is partially oxidized and partially remains the same. But that doesn't make sense unless there's another species being reduced. Wait, but if the sulfur in H₂SO₄ is at +6 and doesn't change, then there's no reduction happening. So this would imply that the reaction is not a redox reaction? But that contradicts the options given, which mention oxidizing agents and such. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the sulfur in Na₂SO₃ is being oxidized to +6 in Na₂SO₄, and the sulfur in H₂SO₄ is being reduced? But how? If H₂SO₄ is acting as an oxidizing agent, then it should be reduced. But sulfur in H₂SO₄ is already at +6, which is its highest oxidation state. How can it be reduced? Unless there's another component in the sulfuric acid that's being reduced. Wait, maybe the hydrogen? But hydrogen is at +1 and would need to be reduced to a lower oxidation state, but in the products, hydrogen is in H₂O where it's still +1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is not a redox reaction. But then why is SO₂ being released? SO₂ is a product, which is a common product when sulfites react with acids. For example, sulfite ions reacting with acids produce SO₂ gas. The general reaction is: SO₃²⁻ + 2H+ → SO₂↑ + H₂O. In this case, the sulfur remains in +4 oxidation state. So that's not a redox reaction. However, in the given reaction, there is also Na₂SO₄ formed. So maybe part of the sulfite is oxidized and part is reduced?\n\nWait, perhaps in this reaction, the sulfite is acting as both an oxidizing and reducing agent? Or maybe the sulfuric acid is acting as an oxidizing agent. Let me think again.\n\nIf the reaction is H₂SO₄ + Na₂SO₃ → Na₂SO₄ + SO₂ + H₂O, then perhaps the Na₂SO₃ is being oxidized to Na₂SO₄ (sulfur from +4 to +6), and the H₂SO₄ is acting as an oxidizing agent. But where is the reduction happening? Because if H₂SO₄ is the oxidizing agent, it should be reduced. But sulfur is already at +6. Unless the sulfuric acid is causing the oxidation and another component is being reduced. Wait, but there's no other element involved. Unless maybe the sulfur in H₂SO₄ is not changing, but another part of the molecule is. But I don't see any other elements. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is not a redox reaction. If that's the case, then the statements about oxidizing agents and such would be incorrect. But the options include (A) H₂SO₄ is an oxidizing agent in this reaction. If the reaction is not redox, then statement A would be incorrect. But how to confirm?\n\nLet me check the oxidation states again. If Na₂SO₃ is being converted to Na₂SO₄ and SO₂, then for each Na₂SO₃ molecule, one sulfur is going to +6 (in Na₂SO₄) and another... Wait, but there's only one sulfur in Na₂SO₃. So maybe the reaction is that the sulfite is acting as a reducing agent, and something else is being oxidized? But what? If the reaction is between H₂SO₄ and Na₂SO₃, and the products are Na₂SO₄, SO₂, and H₂O, then perhaps the sulfite is acting as a reducing agent, causing the sulfuric acid to be reduced? But sulfuric acid's sulfur is at +6. How can that be reduced?\n\nWait, maybe the hydrogen in H₂SO₄ is being reduced? But hydrogen is at +1 and in the products, it's in H₂O, still +1. So no. Alternatively, maybe the oxygen is involved? But oxygen is usually -2 and doesn't change. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different redox process here. Let me think about the reaction again. When a sulfite reacts with an acid, it typically produces SO₂. For example, Na₂SO₃ + 2HCl → 2NaCl + SO₂↑ + H₂O. In this case, the sulfite is acting as a reducing agent? Or is it just a proton transfer? Because in that reaction, the sulfite ion (SO₃²⁻) reacts with H+ to form SO₂ and H₂O. Let me check oxidation states here. In SO₃²⁻, sulfur is +4. In SO₂, sulfur is also +4. So there's no change in oxidation state. Therefore, it's not a redox reaction. It's an acid-base reaction where the sulfite is acting as a base, accepting protons, and decomposing into SO₂ and water. \n\nBut in the given reaction, there is also Na₂SO₄ formed. So why is there Na₂SO₄? Maybe because the reaction is between a strong acid (H₂SO₄) and a weaker acid salt (Na₂SO₃), leading to the formation of the weaker acid (SO₂ and H₂O) and a stronger salt (Na₂SO₄). But why would Na₂SO₄ form? Maybe the sulfuric acid is acting as an oxidizing agent here, causing the sulfite to be oxidized to sulfate. \n\nWait, let me check some standard reactions. For example, when concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with sodium sulfite, it can act as an oxidizing agent. The reaction might be:\n\nNa₂SO₃ + H₂SO₄ → Na₂SO₄ + SO₂ + H₂O.\n\nBut in this case, is there a redox process? Let's check oxidation states again. Sulfur in Na₂SO₃ is +4, in Na₂SO₄ it's +6 (oxidation), and in SO₂ it's +4 (same as original). So only part of the sulfite is oxidized. But where is the reduction happening? If sulfuric acid is acting as an oxidizing agent, then it must be reduced. However, sulfur in H₂SO₄ is already at +6. How can it be reduced? Maybe the sulfuric acid is acting as an acid, not an oxidizing agent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a redox reaction. If that's the case, then the formation of Na₂SO₄ and SO₂ is just a result of acid-base reaction and decomposition. But how? Let me think. The sulfite ion reacts with H+ to form HSO₃⁻, which then decomposes into SO₂ and H₂O. But why would Na₂SO₄ form? Maybe because the sulfuric acid is in excess and reacts with the sulfite to form sulfate. \n\nWait, but in the reaction as written, the stoichiometry is 1:1. Let me check the balanced equation again. Original equation: H₂SO₄ + Na₂SO₃ → Na₂SO₄ + SO₂↑ + H₂O. Let me verify the stoichiometry. If we have 1 mole of H₂SO₄ and 1 mole of Na₂SO₃, we get 1 mole of Na₂SO₄, 1 mole of SO₂, and 1 mole of H₂O. \n\nLet me write the ionic equation. H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so it dissociates into 2H+ + SO₄²⁻. Na₂SO₃ is a salt, dissociating into 2Na+ + SO₃²⁻. The reaction would be:\n\nSO₃²⁻ + 2H+ → SO₂↑ + H₂O.\n\nBut according to this, the sulfate ion (from H₂SO₄) would remain in solution as spectator ions. However, in the given reaction, Na₂SO₄ is formed. So maybe the reaction is:\n\nNa₂SO₃ + H₂SO₄ → Na₂SO₄ + SO₂↑ + H₂O.\n\nIn ionic terms, this would be:\n\nSO₃²⁻ + 2H+ → SO₂↑ + H₂O,\n\nand the sulfate ion from H₂SO₄ would combine with Na+ from Na₂SO₃ to form Na₂SO₄. But in reality, the sulfate ion from sulfuric acid is a spectator ion here. So the actual reaction is just between H+ and SO₃²⁻. Therefore, it's not a redox reaction. \n\nBut then why does the question mention oxidizing agents? Maybe the given reaction is different from the typical reaction. Let me check if there's a possibility that under certain conditions, like with concentrated sulfuric acid, the reaction becomes redox. \n\nConcentrated sulfuric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. For example, when it reacts with non-metallic sulfites, it might oxidize them. But in the case of sodium sulfite, perhaps the reaction is as written. However, if it's concentrated sulfuric acid, maybe it oxidizes sulfite to sulfate and itself is reduced to SO₂. Let me check oxidation states in that scenario.\n\nSuppose H₂SO₄ is acting as an oxidizing agent. It would be reduced. Let's say sulfur in H₂SO₄ goes from +6 to +4 in SO₂. So in that case, H₂SO₄ is reduced to SO₂. Meanwhile, Na₂SO₃ is oxidized to Na₂SO₄. Let me check:\n\nFor the oxidation: S in Na₂SO₃ is +4 → +6 in Na₂SO₄. Change of +2 per S atom.\n\nFor the reduction: S in H₂SO₄ is +6 → +4 in SO₂. Change of -2 per S atom.\n\nSo the number of electrons lost and gained would be equal if one molecule of H₂SO₄ is reduced and one molecule of Na₂SO₃ is oxidized. Therefore, the reaction would be a redox reaction where H₂SO₄ is the oxidizing agent and Na₂SO₃ is the reducing agent. \n\nWait, this makes sense! So in this case, the reaction is a redox reaction. The sulfur in Na₂SO₃ is oxidized from +4 to +6 (in Na₂SO₄), and the sulfur in H₂SO₄ is reduced from +6 to +4 (in SO₂). Therefore, H₂SO₄ is acting as an oxidizing agent, which would make option A correct. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that the reaction between H+ and SO₃²⁻ to form SO₂ and H₂O isn't a redox reaction. However, if the sulfuric acid is acting as an oxidizing agent, then it must be part of the redox process. \n\nSo perhaps the confusion arises from the concentration of sulfuric acid. Dilute sulfuric acid would just act as an acid, leading to a non-redox reaction producing SO₂. However, concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong oxidizing agent and can oxidize sulfites to sulfates while itself being reduced to SO₂. \n\nIn the given reaction, since the product includes Na₂SO₄ (a sulfate), it's likely that the sulfuric acid is acting as an oxidizing agent, oxidizing the sulfite to sulfate, and itself being reduced to SO₂. Therefore, the reaction is a redox reaction. \n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\n(A) H₂SO₄ is an oxidizing agent in this reaction. If the reaction is redox and H₂SO₄ is being reduced, then yes, it's an oxidizing agent. So A is correct.\n\n(B) Na₂SO₃ is easily oxidized by O₂ in the air and deteriorates. Sodium sulfite is indeed prone to oxidation by oxygen in air to form sodium sulfate. For example, 2Na₂SO₃ + O₂ → 2Na₂SO₄. So B is correct.\n\n(C) Na₂SO₄ is an ionic compound containing covalent bonds. Sodium sulfate is an ionic compound composed of Na+ ions and SO₄²⁻ ions. The sulfate ion itself has covalent bonds between sulfur and oxygen. So yes, ionic compound with covalent bonds in the sulfate ion. So C is correct.\n\n(D) SO₂ is the main harmful pollutant causing acid rain. Acid rain is primarily caused by sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). SO₂ reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), which contributes to acid rain. So D is correct.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the following statement is incorrect\". So if all options A-D are correct, but the question states that one is incorrect, then I must have made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait let me check again. \n\nIf the reaction is a redox reaction where H₂SO₄ is acting as oxidizing agent (A is correct), Na₂SO₃ is easily oxidized by O₂ (B is correct), Na₂SO₄ is ionic with covalent bonds (C is correct), and SO₂ is a main pollutant causing acid rain (D is correct). But the question says one of them is incorrect. So where is the error?\n\nWait perhaps option D is incorrect? Let me think. Acid rain is mainly caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. However, the primary acids formed are sulfuric acid (from SO₂) and nitric acid (from NOx). So SO₂ is a precursor to acid rain, but is it the main harmful pollutant? Or is the main pollutant sulfuric acid? The question says \"SO₂ is the main harmful pollutant causing acid rain\". But actually, SO₂ contributes to acid rain, but the main harmful pollutant is the resulting sulfuric acid. However, SO₂ itself is a harmful pollutant and contributes significantly to acid rain. So maybe D is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different issue. Let me check each option again.\n\nOption A: If the reaction is a redox reaction, then H₂SO₄ is the oxidizing agent. Earlier analysis suggests that yes, because it's reduced from +6 to +4 in SO₂. So A is correct.\n\nOption B: Sodium sulfite is easily oxidized by O₂. Yes, because in air, it can oxidize to sulfate. For example, 2Na₂SO₃ + O₂ → 2Na₂SO₄. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: Sodium sulfate is an ionic compound with covalent bonds. Yes, because the sulfate ion has covalent bonds between S and O, while the overall compound is ionic between Na+ and SO₄²⁻. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: SO₂ is the main harmful pollutant causing acid rain. Well, SO₂ is a major contributor to acid rain, but it's not the only one. However, the statement says \"main\", and depending on the region, it might be the main one. For example, in some areas, SO₂ is the primary cause, while in others, NOx might be more prevalent. However, generally, both are considered main causes. However, the question says \"the main harmful pollutant causing acid rain\". If the question is from a textbook that states that the main one is SO₂, then D is correct. But if the question considers that the main pollutant is sulfuric acid (which is formed from SO₂), then D would be incorrect. However, SO₂ is a gas that is directly emitted and contributes to acid rain. So I think D is correct.\n\nBut the question says that one of the options is incorrect. So perhaps my earlier analysis about the redox reaction is wrong. Let me re-examine the oxidation states.\n\nIn the reaction H₂SO₄ + Na₂SO₃ → Na₂SO₄ + SO₂ + H₂O.\n\nLet me track the sulfur atoms:\n\nOriginal compounds:\n\n- H₂SO₄: S is +6.\n\n- Na₂SO₃: S is +4.\n\nProducts:\n\n- Na₂SO₄: S is +6.\n\n- SO₂: S is +4.\n\nSo the sulfur from Na₂SO₃ is split into two parts: one part goes to Na₂SO₄ (oxidized from +4 to +6), and the other part goes to SO₂ (remains at +4). The sulfur from H₂SO₄ is in Na₂SO₄, still +6. So the sulfur in H₂SO₄ is not reduced. Therefore, there is no reduction happening here. Only oxidation of part of the sulfite to sulfate. Therefore, the reaction is not a redox reaction. So my earlier conclusion that it is a redox reaction is incorrect. Therefore, option A is incorrect because H₂SO₄ is not acting as an oxidizing agent in this reaction. \n\nWait, but how can that be? If there is oxidation (of sulfite to sulfate), but no reduction, then it's not a redox reaction. But oxidation without reduction is impossible. Therefore, there must be reduction somewhere. \n\nLet me think again. If Na₂SO₃ is oxidized to Na₂SO₄, then something must be reduced. Where is the reduction happening? \n\nLet me check other elements. Hydrogen: in H₂SO₄ it's +1, and in H₂O it's +1. No change. Oxygen: in all compounds it's -2. Sodium: +1 in both sides. So no change. \n\nWait, unless the sulfur in H₂SO₄ is being reduced? But in the products, sulfur is in Na₂SO₄ at +6 (same as in H₂SO₄) and in SO₂ at +4. So the sulfur in H₂SO₄ is not being reduced overall. However, the sulfur in SO₂ is +4, which is lower than +6. But where is that sulfur coming from? It must be from the Na₂SO₃. So the sulfur in Na₂SO₃ is going to both Na₂SO₄ and SO₂. So part of it is oxidized and part remains. But that doesn't involve reduction of anything else. \n\nWait, unless there's another redox process. Let me consider the entire reaction in terms of electrons. \n\nFor the oxidation part: S in Na₂SO₃ goes from +4 to +6 in Na₂SO₄. That's a loss of 2 electrons per S atom.\n\nFor the reduction part: If there is any, but where? \n\nIf there is no reduction, then this reaction is not a redox reaction. But oxidation without reduction is impossible. Therefore, there must be reduction somewhere. \n\nWait, maybe the hydrogen in H₂SO₄ is being reduced? But hydrogen is +1 in H₂SO₄ and +1 in H₂O. No change. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the oxygen is involved? But oxygen is -2 in all compounds. \n\nWait, unless there's a disproportionation reaction? But in this case, the same substance isn't acting as both oxidizing and reducing agent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the sulfur in SO₂ comes from the sulfite. Let me think about the reaction again. \n\nThe reaction is between H₂SO₄ and Na₂SO₃. The products are Na₂SO₄, SO₂, and H₂O. \n\nLet me write the reaction as ionic. H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so it dissociates into 2H+ + SO₄²⁻. Na₂SO₃ dissociates into 2Na+ + SO₃²⁻. \n\nThe reaction can be written as:\n\nSO₃²⁻ + 2H+ → SO₂↑ + H₂O.\n\nThis is a common reaction where sulfite reacts with acid to produce SO₂. In this case, the oxidation state of sulfur remains +4. Therefore, it's not a redox reaction. The sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) from sulfuric acid is a spectator ion and combines with Na+ to form Na₂SO₄. \n\nSo in this case, the reaction is not a redox reaction. Therefore, option A is incorrect because H₂SO₄ is not acting as an oxidizing agent; it's acting as an acid, providing H+ ions. \n\nSo earlier confusion was because I thought the sulfate ion was part of the redox process, but actually, it's not. The reaction is just an acid-base reaction with decomposition, not a redox reaction. \n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect. So the answer is A. \n\nLet me confirm again. If the reaction is not redox, then there is no oxidizing agent involved in the reaction. Hence, statement A is incorrect. \n\nNow, checking the other options:\n\nB: Sodium sulfite is easily oxidized by O₂. Yes, because in air, it can oxidize to sodium sulfate. Correct.\n\nC: Sodium sulfate is ionic with covalent bonds. Yes, the sulfate ion has covalent bonds. Correct.\n\nD: SO₂ is a main pollutant causing acid rain. Yes. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is option A. \n\nBut wait, the original question is in Chinese, and the options are labeled A to D. The user provided the options as:\n\nOptions: (A) H₂SO₄ is an oxidizing agent in this reaction \n\n(B) Na₂SO₃ is easily oxidized by O₂ in the air and deteriorates \n\n(C) Na₂SO₄ is an ionic compound containing covalent bonds \n\n(D) SO₂ is the main harmful pollutant causing acid rain\n\nSo if A is incorrect, then the answer is A. \n\nBut earlier I thought that if the reaction is not redox, then A is incorrect. But I initially thought it was redox, but upon closer inspection, it's not. So the correct answer is A. \n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is option A.\n</think>"}
