Freshly extracted oils, often referred to as \"new oil,\" contain moisture that can lead to hydrolysis and oxidation, both of which promote rancidity and spoilage. Timely drying and dehydration are standard practices to preserve the oil's quality.\n\n---\n\n**Option B: \"Polyvinyl chloride can be used to make food inner packaging materials.\"**\n\nThis is the **incorrect** statement. While **polyvinyl chloride (PVC)** is used in some packaging applications, it is **not typically approved for direct contact with food** in many countries due to the potential leaching of harmful additives like plasticizers (e.g., phthalates), which can migrate into the food and pose health risks. Therefore, PVC is **not considered safe for food inner packaging materials**, making this statement **false**.\n\n---\n\n**Option C: \"Vitamin C can serve as an antioxidant for pre-packaged food.\"**\n\nThis is a **correct** statement. **Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)** is a well-known antioxidant used in food preservation. It helps prevent oxidative spoilage and is commonly used in pre-packaged foods to maintain freshness and color.\n\n---\n\n**Option D: \"Brine tofu coagulation essentially belongs to protein precipitation.\"**\n\nThis is also **correct**. Tofu is made by coagulating soy milk, and brine (often containing calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride) acts as a coagulant. The process involves the **precipitation of soy proteins**, forming the curds that become tofu.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out which of the given statements is incorrect. The options are A through D. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: \"New oil is prone to spoilage if not dried and dehydrated in a timely manner.\" Hmm. New oil, like freshly extracted oil, probably has a higher moisture content. If not dried properly, moisture can promote oxidation or microbial growth, leading to spoilage. That makes sense. So A might be correct.\n\nOption B: \"Polyvinyl chloride can be used to make food inner packaging materials.\" Polyvinyl chloride is PVC. I remember that PVC is a plastic, but is it food-safe? Wait, some plastics are used for food packaging, like PET (polyethylene terephthalate) or LDPE. PVC is used in some food packaging, like cling film, but there might be concerns about additives or phthalates leaching into food. However, in some cases, it's approved for short-term use. But the question is whether it's used. I'm a bit unsure here. Maybe in some inner packaging? Not sure if it's allowed or considered safe. Maybe B is incorrect?\n\nOption C: \"Vitamin C can serve as an antioxidant for pre-packaged food.\" Vitamin C is ascorbic acid, which is a common antioxidant. It's used in foods to prevent oxidation, like in fruit juices or in packaging to keep food fresh. So C sounds correct.\n\nOption D: \"Brine tofu coagulation essentially belongs to protein precipitation.\" Tofu is made by coagulating soy milk. Brine (like calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride) is used as a coagulant. The process of coagulation in tofu does involve protein precipitation. So D is correct.\n\nSo the incorrect one is likely B. PVC might not be suitable for food packaging, or maybe it's not allowed. Wait, but some sources say that PVC is approved for certain food contact applications, though it's less common than other plastics. However, there are regulations about which plastics can be used. If the question is about standard practice, maybe B is incorrect because PVC is not typically used for food inner packaging. Alternatively, maybe the statement is correct. Hmm. I need to verify. Let me think again. For example, in some countries, PVC is used for food packaging, like for cheese wraps, but there are restrictions. However, in China, for example, PVC is not allowed for certain food uses. But the question is in English, so maybe general knowledge. Alternatively, maybe the issue is that PVC is not used as inner packaging. Wait, inner packaging materials are the ones that directly contact the food. If PVC is used, but maybe it's not allowed because of potential harmful substances leaching. So the statement B is incorrect because PVC isn't suitable for food inner packaging. Therefore, the answer is B.\n</think>"}
