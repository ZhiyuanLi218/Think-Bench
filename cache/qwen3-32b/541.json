Fossil fuels are formed over millions of years through the decomposition of organic matter and are therefore **non-renewable**. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and biomass, can be replenished naturally in a short period. Kerosene does not fall into this category.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: \"In the combustion process of $\\mathrm{H}_2$, thermal energy is converted into chemical energy.\"**\n\nThis statement is also **incorrect**.  \nHydrogen combustion is an exothermic chemical reaction:  \n$$\n2\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} + \\text{Energy}\n$$  \nDuring this process, **chemical energy stored in the bonds** of hydrogen and oxygen is **converted into thermal energy** (heat and light). The reverse is not true; the energy is being **released**, not stored.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: \"The mass number of ${ }^{20} \\mathrm{Ne}$ in Martian meteorites is 20.\"**\n\nThis statement is **correct**.  \nThe notation ${ }^{20} \\mathrm{Ne}$ refers to an isotope of **neon** with a mass number of 20. The mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Neon has an atomic number of 10 (10 protons), so ${ }^{20} \\mathrm{Ne}$ has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. The **mass number remains 20**, regardless of the source (Martian meteorites or elsewhere). This is a factual and consistent property of the isotope.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: \"${ }^{3} \\mathrm{He}$ in lunar soil and ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{H}$ on Earth are isotopes of each other.\"**\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**.  \nIsotopes are atoms of the **same element** with different numbers of neutrons.  \n- ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{He}$ (helium-3) has 2 protons and 1 neutron.  \n- ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{H}$ (tritium) has 1 proton and 2 neutrons.  \n\nSince they belong to **different elements** (helium vs. hydrogen), they are **not isotopes**. Isotopes must have the same number of protons (i.e., be the same element). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Correct Answer: (C)**  \nOnly **Option C** is scientifically accurate.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to work through this question step by step. The question is about chemistry-related facts related to China's space missions like Tianwen-1 and Chang'e-5. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which ones are correct.\n\nFirst, let me read each option carefully and analyze them one by one.\n\nOption A: Kerosene is a renewable energy source. Hmm, kerosene is a type of fuel derived from crude oil, right? Crude oil is a fossil fuel, which takes millions of years to form. Since it's a fossil fuel, it's non-renewable because we can't replenish it on a human timescale. So A is probably incorrect. Renewable energy sources would be things like solar, wind, or biomass. Kerosene isn't renewable, so A is wrong.\n\nOption B: In the combustion process of H2 (hydrogen), thermal energy is converted into chemical energy. Wait, combustion is a chemical reaction where a substance reacts with oxygen, releasing energy. For hydrogen combustion, the reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, releasing energy. So during combustion, chemical energy stored in the bonds of H2 and O2 is converted into thermal energy (heat) and light. So the statement says thermal energy is converted into chemical energy, which is the opposite of what actually happens. So B is incorrect. The correct conversion is chemical energy to thermal energy.\n\nOption C: The mass number of ²⁰Ne in Martian meteorites is 20. The notation ²⁰Ne refers to an isotope of neon where the mass number is 20. The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Neon has an atomic number of 10, so ²⁰Ne has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. The mass number is indeed 20, so regardless of where it's found (Martian meteorites or elsewhere), the mass number is 20. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nOption D: ³He in lunar soil and ³H on Earth are isotopes of each other. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. ³He is helium-3, which has 2 protons and 1 neutron (since 3 - 2 = 1 neutron). ³H is tritium, hydrogen-3, which has 1 proton and 2 neutrons (3 -1 = 2). Since they have different numbers of protons (helium vs. hydrogen), they are not isotopes. Isotopes must be the same element (same number of protons). So D is incorrect. They are different elements, so they can't be isotopes. Instead, ³He and ⁴He are isotopes of each other because they're both helium with different neutrons.\n\nSo reviewing the options:\n\nA: Incorrect (kerosene is non-renewable)\n\nB: Incorrect (chemical to thermal, not the other way around)\n\nC: Correct (mass number is 20)\n\nD: Incorrect (different elements, not isotopes)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>"}
