Applying the Given Constraints**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- $ s_{12} = 0 $: particles 1 and 2 form a **singlet** state, i.e., their total spin is zero.\n- $ s = \\frac{1}{2} $: the total spin of the system is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFrom the first condition, we know:\n\n$$\nS_{12} = S_1 + S_2 = 0\n$$\n\nThis implies that:\n\n$$\nS_1 \\cdot S_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(S_{12}^2 - S_1^2 - S_2^2 \\right)\n$$\n\nSince $ S_{12}^2 = 0 $ for $ s_{12} = 0 $, and each individual spin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, we have:\n\n$$\nS_1^2 = S_2^2 = \\frac{3}{4} \\hbar^2\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nS_1 \\cdot S_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(0 - \\frac{3}{4} \\hbar^2 - \\frac{3}{4} \\hbar^2 \\right) = -\\frac{3}{4} \\hbar^2\n$$\n\nSo the first term of the Hamiltonian becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{A}{\\hbar^2} S_1 \\cdot S_2 = \\frac{A}{\\hbar^2} \\left(-\\frac{3}{4} \\hbar^2 \\right) = -\\frac{3A}{4}\n$$\n\nNow consider the second term:\n\n$$\n\\frac{B}{\\hbar^2} S_{12} \\cdot S_3\n$$\n\nSince $ S_{12} = 0 $, this term vanishes:\n\n$$\nS_{12} \\cdot S_3 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{B}{\\hbar^2} S_{12} \\cdot S_3 = 0\n$$\n\nHence, the **entire Hamiltonian** reduces to:\n\n$$\nH = -\\frac{3A}{4}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **3.

The conditions are that the combined spin of particles 1 and 2 is zero (s₁₂ = 0) and the total spin of the system is s = 1/2. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the Hamiltonian looks like. It's given by:\n\nH = (A/ħ²) S₁·S₂ + (B/ħ²)(S₁ + S₂)·S₃\n\nHmm, so there are two terms here. The first term is the interaction between spins 1 and 2, and the second term is the interaction between the combined spin of 1 and 2 with spin 3. Since the particles are non-identical, I don't have to worry about symmetrizing the wavefunction or anything like that. But the problem specifies that s₁₂ = 0 and s = 1/2. So maybe I can use that to simplify things?\n\nLet me start by considering the first term, S₁·S₂. I remember that for two spin-1/2 particles, the dot product can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared. The formula is:\n\nS₁·S₂ = [S_total² - S₁² - S₂²]/2\n\nIn this case, since particles 1 and 2 combine to s₁₂ = 0, their total spin squared would be S_total² = 0(0+1)ħ² = 0. Then S₁² and S₂² are each (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Therefore:\n\nS₁·S₂ = [0 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²]/2 = (-3/2 ħ²)/2 = -3/4 ħ²\n\nSo the first term in the Hamiltonian becomes (A/ħ²)(-3/4 ħ²) = -3A/4. So that term is just a constant? Wait, that seems strange. If s₁₂ is fixed to 0, then S₁·S₂ is fixed, so that term is just a constant energy contribution. Interesting. So maybe the first term just contributes a constant energy of -3A/4, and the rest of the Hamiltonian comes from the second term?\n\nNow, the second term is (B/ħ²)(S₁ + S₂)·S₃. But since S₁ + S₂ is the total spin of particles 1 and 2, which we already know is zero because s₁₂ = 0. Therefore, S₁ + S₂ = 0. Therefore, the entire second term becomes zero? Wait, that would mean the Hamiltonian is just -3A/4? But that can't be right, can it?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again. If s₁₂ = 0, then the total spin of particles 1 and 2 is zero. Therefore, their vector sum S₁ + S₂ is zero. Therefore, (S₁ + S₂)·S₃ is zero. Therefore, the second term in the Hamiltonian is zero. Therefore, the entire Hamiltonian is just -3A/4? But then the energy would be just that constant. However, the problem says to calculate the energy levels and their degeneracy when s₁₂ = 0 and s = 1/2. Maybe I need to consider the total spin of the system?\n\nWait, the total spin of the system is s = 1/2. But if particles 1 and 2 are in a spin-0 state, and particle 3 is spin-1/2, then combining spin-0 and spin-1/2 should give total spin s = 1/2. So there's only one way to combine them, right? So maybe there is only one state here? But then the degeneracy would be... Well, the spin-1/2 state has 2(1/2)+1 = 2 states. But if s₁₂ is fixed to 0, and then combining with s₃ gives s = 1/2, then maybe there is a two-fold degeneracy? But if the Hamiltonian is just a constant, then the energy level is non-degenerate? Wait, but the problem is asking for degeneracy. Maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that even though s₁₂ is fixed to 0, there might be different states with that property? But for two spin-1/2 particles, the spin-0 state is unique (up to normalization). So there is only one state for s₁₂ = 0. Then combining with particle 3's spin-1/2, you get a total spin of 1/2. Since combining spin-0 and spin-1/2 can only give spin-1/2. So the total Hilbert space here is 1 (from s₁₂=0) multiplied by 2 (from s₃=1/2), but since combining gives s=1/2, which has 2 states. Therefore, the total Hilbert space is two-dimensional. But if the Hamiltonian is just a constant, then the energy is the same for both states, so the degeneracy is 2?\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"calculate the energy levels and their degeneracy for the system when s₁₂ = 0 and s = 1/2\". So maybe I need to think about the states with s₁₂=0 and total spin s=1/2. Since the Hamiltonian is a constant, the energy is just -3A/4, and the degeneracy is 2? But that seems too easy. Maybe I missed something?\n\nWait, let me check again the second term. The second term is (S₁ + S₂)·S₃. Since s₁₂=0, then S₁ + S₂ = 0. Therefore, that term is zero. Therefore, the entire Hamiltonian is just -3A/4. Therefore, the energy is fixed. Therefore, regardless of the state, as long as s₁₂=0, the energy is -3A/4. But since we are also given that the total spin s=1/2, but since s₁₂=0 and s₃=1/2, combining them gives s=1/2. Therefore, the total Hilbert space for this case is two states, both with energy -3A/4. Therefore, the energy level is -3A/4 with degeneracy 2. Is that the answer?\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions the Hamiltonian has terms involving B. If the second term is zero, then B doesn't contribute? But why is B there? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that (S₁ + S₂)·S₃ is zero? Let me think again.\n\nIf s₁₂ = 0, then the total spin vector S₁₂ = S₁ + S₂ = 0. Therefore, any operator that involves S₁ + S₂ would act as zero. Therefore, (S₁ + S₂)·S₃ is zero. Therefore, the second term is zero. Therefore, B doesn't contribute. But why is B in the Hamiltonian? Maybe the problem is considering that even though s₁₂=0, there is still some dependence? Or maybe I need to consider the total spin?\n\nWait, but the total spin is s = 1/2. However, since the total spin is S_total = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0 + S₃ = S₃. Therefore, the total spin is just the spin of particle 3. Therefore, the total spin s=1/2 is automatically satisfied because particle 3 is spin-1/2. Therefore, there is no additional constraint here. Therefore, the states are just the singlet state of particles 1 and 2 combined with the two states of particle 3. However, since the total spin is s=1/2, but since S_total = S₃, then the total spin is just determined by particle 3. Therefore, there are two states here. But since the Hamiltonian is a constant, the energy is non-degenerate? But the two states have the same energy, so the degeneracy is 2. Therefore, the energy level is -3A/4 with degeneracy 2. Is that the answer?\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I need to express the Hamiltonian in terms of total spins? Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire system.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = (A/ħ²) S₁·S₂ + (B/ħ²)(S₁ + S₂)·S₃.\n\nLet me try to write this in terms of total spins. Let me denote S₁₂ = S₁ + S₂, and then the total spin S = S₁₂ + S₃. Then perhaps I can express S₁·S₂ in terms of S₁₂². As before:\n\nS₁·S₂ = [S₁₂² - S₁² - S₂²]/2\n\nSimilarly, (S₁ + S₂)·S₃ = S₁₂·S₃. Which can be expressed in terms of total spin S²:\n\nS₁₂·S₃ = [S² - S₁₂² - S₃²]/2\n\nTherefore, substituting into the Hamiltonian:\n\nH = (A/ħ²) [ (S₁₂² - S₁² - S₂²)/2 ] + (B/ħ²)[ (S² - S₁₂² - S₃²)/2 ]\n\nBut given that particles 1, 2, 3 are all spin-1/2, their individual spin squared are all (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².\n\nTherefore:\n\nH = (A/(2ħ²)) [S₁₂² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²] + (B/(2ħ²))[S² - S₁₂² - 3/4 ħ²]\n\nSimplify:\n\nH = (A/(2ħ²))[S₁₂² - 3/2 ħ²] + (B/(2ħ²))[S² - S₁₂² - 3/4 ħ²]\n\nNow, the problem states that s₁₂ = 0, so S₁₂² = 0(0 + 1)ħ² = 0. Also, the total spin s = 1/2, so S² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, substituting these values:\n\nH = (A/(2ħ²))[0 - 3/2 ħ²] + (B/(2ħ²))[ (3/4 ħ²) - 0 - 3/4 ħ² ]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (A/(2ħ²))(- 3/2 ħ²) = - (3A)/4\n\nSecond term: (B/(2ħ²))( 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) = 0\n\nTherefore, H = -3A/4 + 0 = -3A/4. So indeed, the energy is just -3A/4. Therefore, regardless of the value of B, since in this particular case the second term cancels out. Therefore, the energy level is -3A/4. And the degeneracy is 2, since the total spin s=1/2 has multiplicity 2.\n\nWait, but why does the problem mention the Hamiltonian includes B? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check again. The problem says \"when s₁₂ = 0 and s = 1/2\". So in this subspace of states where s₁₂=0 and total s=1/2, the Hamiltonian reduces to a constant. Therefore, all states in this subspace have the same energy. Since the subspace has dimension 2 (as s=1/2), the degeneracy is 2. Therefore, the energy level is -3A/4 with degeneracy 2. Therefore, the answer is that the energy is -3A/4 and degeneracy 2.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? For example, considering the eigenstates?\n\nThe state with s₁₂=0 is the singlet state of particles 1 and 2. Let me denote this state as |0, 0⟩ for the combined spin-1/2 and spin-1/2. Then, particle 3 is in a spin-1/2 state. The total state would be the tensor product of |0, 0⟩ and the state of particle 3. However, since we want the total spin s=1/2, combining |0⟩ and |1/2⟩ gives only s=1/2. Therefore, there are two states: |0⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ and |0⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩, but these are not eigenstates of total spin. Wait, actually, when combining spin 0 and spin 1/2, the total spin is uniquely 1/2. Therefore, the two states are the two possible spin states of the total system. However, since the Hamiltonian is a scalar (constant), it acts as a multiple of the identity matrix on this two-dimensional subspace. Therefore, the energy is the same for both states, hence degeneracy 2.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the energy level is -3A/4 with degeneracy 2. Therefore, the answer is energy E = -3A/4, degeneracy 2.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more if there's any possibility that the second term isn't zero. Suppose that even though S₁ + S₂ = 0 in expectation value, maybe there are off-diagonal terms? But no, because if we are in the subspace where s₁₂ = 0, then S₁ + S₂ = 0 as operators in that subspace. Therefore, (S₁ + S₂)·S₃ = 0 in that subspace. Therefore, the second term is zero. Therefore, the entire Hamiltonian is just the first term, which is a constant. Therefore, the energy is fixed.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is correct. The energy is -3A/4 and the degeneracy is 2. Therefore, I think that's the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy level is $\\boxed{-\\dfrac{3A}{4}}$ with degeneracy 2.\n</think>"}
