Then, I also need to calculate the magnetic induction of the external field. Let me start by recalling what each of these effects entails and how they differ from each other.\n\nFirst, the Normal Zeeman Effect occurs when the spectral lines split into three components in the presence of an external magnetic field. This effect is observed in atoms with zero spin, such as hydrogen in certain transitions where the spin-orbit interaction is negligible. In this case, the splitting is due purely to the interaction between the magnetic field and the orbital angular momentum of the electron. The energy levels split according to the magnetic quantum number m_l, and the splitting is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.\n\nOn the other hand, the Anomalous Zeeman Effect is observed in atoms with non-zero spin. Here, the splitting is more complex because both the orbital and spin angular momenta contribute to the total angular momentum. The splitting depends on the total angular momentum quantum number j and the Landé g-factor. The term \"anomalous\" is historical, as it was observed before the understanding of electron spin.\n\nThe Paschen-Back Effect is a strong magnetic field regime where the external magnetic field is so strong that it disrupts the coupling between the orbital and spin angular momenta. In this case, the splitting reverts to a pattern similar to the Normal Zeeman Effect, but because the spin is now also interacting with the magnetic field, the splitting is more complex. However, the key here is that the Paschen-Back Effect occurs in strong fields where the spin-orbit coupling is overcome by the external field, leading to a breakdown of the LS coupling.\n\nGiven that the problem mentions a splitting of spectral lines with an energy difference between adjacent lines of ΔE_z = 4.50 × 10^-4 eV, I need to determine which effect this corresponds to. The key here is to calculate the magnetic field strength and see if it falls into the regime typical for the Normal Zeeman, Anomalous, or Paschen-Back Effect.\n\nBut first, let me recall the formula for the Zeeman splitting. For the Normal Zeeman Effect, the energy splitting is given by ΔE = μ_B * B * Δm_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field, and Δm_l is the difference in magnetic quantum numbers between adjacent levels. Since in the Normal Zeeman Effect, the splitting is between m_l values differing by 1 (since each level is separated by Δm = 1), the energy difference between adjacent lines would be ΔE = μ_B * B * 1. \n\nFor the Anomalous Zeeman Effect, the splitting is given by ΔE = g_j * μ_B * B * Δm_j, where g_j is the Landé g-factor for the particular energy level. The Landé g-factor depends on the quantum numbers L, S, and J. The value of Δm_j here can also be 1, but because g_j is different from 1 (for example, for S-state electrons, the g-factor can be around 2), the splitting would be different. However, the problem mentions \"adjacent lines,\" so regardless of the g-factor, the splitting between adjacent m_j levels would be ΔE = g_j * μ_B * B * 1. \n\nThe Paschen-Back Effect is more complicated because the spin and orbital angular momenta are decoupled, and the splitting is determined by the individual contributions of orbital and spin angular momenta. However, in practice, the Paschen-Back Effect occurs in very strong magnetic fields where the Zeeman splitting becomes larger than the spin-orbit coupling. So, if the magnetic field is strong enough, the splitting would be larger. But without knowing the specific atom or transition, it's hard to say. However, maybe we can calculate the magnetic field strength and see if it's in the range where the Paschen-Back Effect is expected.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step. Let me first assume that this is the Normal Zeeman Effect. Then, using the formula ΔE = μ_B * B. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T. Therefore, solving for B gives B = ΔE / μ_B.\n\nLet me compute that. Given ΔE_z = 4.50 × 10^-4 eV.\n\nSo, B = (4.50 × 10^-4 eV) / (5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T) ≈ let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 4.50 / 5.788 ≈ 0.777. Then, 10^-4 / 10^-5 = 10^1. So total is 0.777 × 10^1 ≈ 7.77 Tesla.\n\nHmm, 7.77 Tesla is a fairly strong magnetic field. Let me recall typical magnetic fields for different effects. The Normal Zeeman Effect is typically observed in relatively weak magnetic fields, but it's possible. However, the Paschen-Back Effect occurs in much stronger fields, where the Zeeman splitting becomes comparable to or larger than the spin-orbit coupling energy. For example, in hydrogen, the spin-orbit coupling is on the order of 10^-4 eV or smaller, so if the Zeeman splitting is 4.5 × 10^-4 eV, that might be comparable or larger. However, hydrogen is a case where the Normal Zeeman Effect is observed when the spin is not involved (e.g., singlet transitions), but for other atoms with significant spin-orbit coupling, a splitting of 4.5 × 10^-4 eV would be in the regime of the Paschen-Back Effect if the spin-orbit coupling is smaller than that. \n\nBut without knowing the specific atom or transition, perhaps we can assume that if the splitting is due to the Normal Zeeman Effect, then the magnetic field is around 7.77 T. However, if the splitting is due to the Anomalous Zeeman Effect, then the Landé g-factor would modify the effective splitting. For example, if the Landé g-factor is 2 (as in a pure spin contribution), then the splitting would be ΔE = 2 * μ_B * B. In that case, solving for B would give B = ΔE / (2 * μ_B) = 4.50 × 10^-4 / (2 * 5.788 × 10^-5) ≈ 4.50 / 1.1576 × 10^-4 / 10^-5 ≈ 3.89 × 10^1 ≈ 3.89 T. Wait, but that would mean if the splitting was due to a Landé g-factor of 2, the magnetic field would be lower. But the problem doesn't specify which effect it is, so we need to figure it out based on the given energy difference.\n\nBut how? The problem is that without knowing the Landé g-factor or the specific transition, we can't directly determine whether it's Anomalous or Normal. However, perhaps we can make an assumption based on typical values. Let me think.\n\nThe Normal Zeeman Effect is a special case where the splitting is purely due to orbital angular momentum (since spin is zero). The Anomalous Zeeman Effect is when spin is involved, leading to a more complex splitting pattern, but the splitting per unit magnetic field is modified by the Landé g-factor. The Paschen-Back Effect is when the magnetic field is so strong that the spin and orbital angular momenta are decoupled, and the splitting is again more like the Normal Zeeman but with contributions from both spin and orbital.\n\nBut how can we determine which effect is happening here? Well, if the splitting is due to the Normal Zeeman Effect, then the splitting is given by ΔE = μ_B * B. If it's Anomalous, then it's ΔE = g_j * μ_B * B. However, since we don't know g_j, unless we can assume a value. Alternatively, if the splitting is between adjacent lines, perhaps the number of lines can help. For example, the Normal Zeeman splits into three lines (for a transition with Δm_l = -1, 0, +1), so adjacent lines have a splitting of 2μ_B B (between m_l = -1 and +1?), no, wait, adjacent m_l levels differ by 1, so between m_l = -1 and 0 is ΔE = μ_B B, and between 0 and +1 is also μ_B B. So the adjacent lines have spacing of μ_B B. Similarly, for Anomalous Zeeman, adjacent m_j levels would have spacing of g_j μ_B B. However, if the Landé g-factor is different for different levels, then the splitting might not be uniform. However, in the problem, they mention \"the energy difference between adjacent lines\", implying that the splitting is uniform, which would be the case for the Normal Zeeman Effect. In the Anomalous Zeeman Effect, unless the Landé g-factors are the same for both levels involved in the transition, the splitting might not be uniform. However, in some cases, especially for transitions between levels with the same Landé g-factor, the splitting can be uniform. \n\nBut without knowing the specific transition, perhaps we can assume that if the splitting is uniform and corresponds to the Bohr magneton, it's the Normal Zeeman Effect. If it's larger, then maybe Anomalous with a g-factor greater than 1. However, given that the calculated field is about 7.77 T if it's Normal, which is a strong field but not extremely so. The Paschen-Back Effect is in the regime where the magnetic field is so strong that it overcomes the spin-orbit coupling. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in the hydrogen atom, the spin-orbit coupling energy is on the order of 10^-4 eV or less. If the Zeeman splitting is 4.5 × 10^-4 eV, which is larger than the spin-orbit coupling, then in hydrogen, this would be in the Paschen-Back regime. However, the Normal Zeeman Effect in hydrogen is observed only in specific transitions where the total spin is zero (so no spin-orbit coupling). For other atoms with significant spin-orbit coupling, if the Zeeman splitting becomes larger than the spin-orbit coupling, then the Paschen-Back Effect occurs. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the atom or transition, it's challenging. However, given that the question is asking whether it's Normal, Anomalous, or Paschen-Back, and given that the splitting is uniform (as implied by \"adjacent lines\" with a given ΔE), it's possible that this is the Normal Zeeman Effect. However, if the magnetic field is strong enough to cause Paschen-Back, then the splitting would also be uniform? Wait, in the Paschen-Back Effect, the splitting is more complex because the spin and orbital momenta are decoupled, but in that case, the splitting might not be uniform. However, if the spin and orbital are decoupled, then the energy levels split according to the individual contributions of L and S. For example, for a given level with orbital angular momentum l and spin s, the splitting would be (m_l * μ_B + m_s * g_s * μ_B) * B. If the spin is 1/2, then m_s is ±1/2. So, the splitting would have different components. However, if we consider transitions where the spin doesn't change (Δm_s = 0), then the splitting would be based on Δm_l. However, in general, the Paschen-Back splitting is more complex and may not result in uniform spacing between adjacent lines. Therefore, if the problem states that the energy difference between adjacent lines is a certain value, and it's uniform, that suggests the splitting is due to the Normal Zeeman Effect.\n\nTherefore, tentatively, I can assume that this is the Normal Zeeman Effect, calculate the magnetic field accordingly, and then check if that magnetic field strength is in the regime where the Paschen-Back Effect would occur. If it is, then maybe the answer is Paschen-Back. But without knowing the spin-orbit coupling energy of the specific transition, it's hard to be certain. However, given that the question is likely expecting us to calculate the magnetic field assuming it's the Normal Zeeman Effect, and then perhaps based on the field strength determine which effect it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed such that the given ΔE_z corresponds to the Normal Zeeman Effect. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, using ΔE = μ_B * B, solving for B:\n\nB = ΔE / μ_B\n\nGiven ΔE_z = 4.50 × 10^-4 eV\n\nμ_B = 5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T\n\nTherefore:\n\nB = (4.50 × 10^-4 eV) / (5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T) ≈ let's calculate this.\n\nFirst, divide 4.50 by 5.788:\n\n4.50 / 5.788 ≈ 0.777\n\nThen, 10^-4 / 10^-5 = 10^1\n\nTherefore, B ≈ 0.777 × 10^1 T ≈ 7.77 T\n\nSo approximately 7.8 Tesla.\n\nNow, is this magnetic field strength in the regime of the Normal Zeeman Effect, Anomalous Zeeman Effect, or Paschen-Back?\n\nThe Normal Zeeman Effect typically occurs when the magnetic field is weak enough that the spin-orbit coupling dominates over the Zeeman splitting. The Anomalous Zeeman Effect is when the spin is involved and the field is not strong enough to decouple spin and orbital angular momenta. The Paschen-Back Effect occurs when the magnetic field is strong enough to decouple spin and orbital angular momenta, i.e., when the Zeeman energy is much larger than the spin-orbit coupling energy.\n\nTo determine which effect it is, we need to compare the Zeeman energy (ΔE_z) with the spin-orbit coupling energy (ΔE_SO). However, since we don't have the specific atom or transition, we can make an estimate. For example, in hydrogen, the spin-orbit coupling is very small (on the order of 10^-4 eV for the fine structure splitting). If ΔE_z is 4.5 × 10^-4 eV, then in hydrogen, this would mean that the Zeeman splitting is larger than the spin-orbit coupling, so the Paschen-Back Effect would occur. However, in hydrogen, the Normal Zeeman Effect is only observed in transitions where the total spin is zero (so no spin-orbit coupling). Therefore, if the given transition is in hydrogen, and if the Zeeman splitting is larger than the fine structure splitting, then it would be the Paschen-Back Effect. However, if the transition is in an atom with a much larger spin-orbit coupling, such that ΔE_z is smaller than ΔE_SO, then it would be the Anomalous Zeeman Effect.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the atom, it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem is asking to identify the effect based solely on the energy difference and the calculated magnetic field, perhaps there's another approach. For example, in the Anomalous Zeeman Effect, the splitting would depend on the Landé g-factor. If we assume a typical Landé g-factor, say for a term with L=0 (pure spin), the Landé g-factor is 2. In that case, the splitting would be ΔE = 2 * μ_B * B. If we solve for B, then B = ΔE / (2 * μ_B) = 4.50 × 10^-4 / (2 * 5.788 × 10^-5) ≈ 4.50 / 1.1576 × 10^-4 / 10^-5 ≈ 3.89 × 10^1 ≈ 3.89 T. But we calculated 7.77 T for the Normal Zeeman. However, without knowing the Landé g-factor, we can't determine this. \n\nBut the question is likely expecting us to assume that since the splitting is given as ΔE_z between adjacent lines, and if we assume that this is the Normal Zeeman Effect (as the simplest case), then calculate the magnetic field as approximately 7.8 T. Then, determine whether this field strength is in the regime of Normal, Anomalous, or Paschen-Back. \n\nGiven that 7.8 T is a fairly strong magnetic field, but not extremely so. For example, in many laboratory settings, magnetic fields up to a few Tesla are common. However, whether it's strong enough to cause Paschen-Back depends on the spin-orbit coupling. For example, in hydrogen, the fine structure (which is the spin-orbit coupling) is about 10^-4 eV. Let me check that. The fine structure splitting in hydrogen is on the order of 10^-4 eV. For example, the 2p fine structure splitting is about 0.000048 eV (4.8 × 10^-5 eV). If the Zeeman splitting is 4.5 × 10^-4 eV, which is about 10 times larger than the fine structure splitting, then this would be in the Paschen-Back regime for hydrogen. Therefore, if the transition in question is from hydrogen, then the effect would be Paschen-Back. However, if the transition is from an atom with a much larger spin-orbit coupling, say on the order of 1 eV, then 4.5 × 10^-4 eV is negligible, and the effect would be Anomalous Zeeman. \n\nBut since the problem does not specify the atom, perhaps we can assume that the splitting is due to the Normal Zeeman Effect if the spin is zero, or the Anomalous otherwise. However, since the energy difference is given, and assuming that the splitting is uniform (as in the Normal Zeeman), and given that the calculated magnetic field is 7.8 T, which for hydrogen would be in the Paschen-Back regime, but for other atoms might not be. \n\nBut the problem is likely expecting us to answer based on the calculated field strength and standard expectations. Since the Paschen-Back Effect occurs in strong magnetic fields where the Zeeman splitting is larger than the spin-orbit coupling. If we take the example of hydrogen, which is a common case, and given that 7.8 T would produce a Zeeman splitting larger than the fine structure splitting, then the answer would be Paschen-Back. However, if the question assumes that it's a case where spin is zero (so Normal Zeeman), then it would be Normal Zeeman. \n\nBut how can we decide? The problem says \"the splitting of spectral lines in an external magnetic field results in an energy difference...\". The question is whether this is Normal, Anomalous, or Paschen-Back. The key is that the Normal Zeeman Effect is when the splitting is into three lines (for a transition with Δm_l = ±1, 0), and the splitting is uniform. The Anomalous Zeeman Effect is when the splitting is into more lines, and the splitting is not necessarily uniform. The Paschen-Back is when the splitting is similar to Normal but occurs in strong fields. \n\nHowever, the problem states \"the splitting of spectral lines\", which could be any number of lines. But since they mention \"adjacent lines\" with a given ΔE, and if the splitting is uniform, then it could be either Normal or Paschen-Back. But Paschen-Back is typically associated with more complex splitting patterns. However, if the spin is decoupled, but the splitting is uniform between adjacent m_l or m_s levels, it might still look similar. \n\nBut given that the problem is likely expecting a straightforward answer, and given that the calculated magnetic field is about 7.8 T, which is a strong field, and assuming that for a typical atom with significant spin-orbit coupling, this field would be in the Paschen-Back regime. However, without knowing the specific atom, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the given ΔE_z corresponds to the Normal Zeeman Effect. For example, if we consider that the Normal Zeeman Effect is when the splitting is due to orbital angular momentum only (spin zero), and the energy difference between adjacent lines is ΔE = μ_B * B, then the answer would be Normal Zeeman Effect with B ≈ 7.8 T. \n\nBut how can we be sure? Let me check standard magnetic field strengths for each effect. The Normal Zeeman Effect is typically observed in weak magnetic fields, maybe up to a few Tesla. The Anomalous Zeeman Effect can occur in a range of fields, and the Paschen-Back in strong fields. However, there's no strict cutoff. For example, 7.8 T is a strong field, but whether it's enough for Paschen-Back depends on the atom. \n\nBut given that the problem gives a specific energy difference and asks to identify the effect, perhaps we need to consider that if the splitting is uniform and can be explained by the Normal Zeeman formula, then it's the Normal Zeeman Effect. However, the Anomalous Zeeman Effect can also have uniform splitting if the Landé g-factor is the same for both levels. For example, if both the upper and lower levels have the same Landé g-factor, then the transition would have a uniform splitting. In such a case, the splitting would be ΔE = g * μ_B * B * Δm_j. If the Landé g-factor is different from 1, then the magnetic field would be different. \n\nBut since we don't know the Landé g-factor, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that it's the Normal Zeeman Effect. Alternatively, maybe the question is designed to recognize that the given energy difference corresponds to the Paschen-Back Effect because of the strength of the magnetic field. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use another approach. The Paschen-Back Effect occurs when the magnetic field is strong enough that the Zeeman energy becomes comparable to or larger than the spin-orbit coupling energy. The spin-orbit coupling energy is given by:\n\nΔE_SO ≈ (μ_B^2 / ħ^2) * (L·S) / r^3\n\nBut this is complicated. Alternatively, for an electron with orbital angular momentum l and spin s, the spin-orbit coupling energy can be approximated as:\n\nΔE_SO ≈ (1/2) * (μ_B^2 / ħ^2) * (j(j+1) - l(l+1) - s(s+1)) / (m_e c^2 r^3)\n\nBut this is too vague. Alternatively, for hydrogen, the fine structure splitting is on the order of α^4 * 13.6 eV, where α ≈ 1/137. So α^4 is about 10^-8, so fine structure splitting is about 10^-4 eV, as I mentioned earlier. If the Zeeman splitting ΔE_z = 4.5 × 10^-4 eV is larger than this, then in hydrogen it would be in the Paschen-Back regime. \n\nAssuming that the transition is in hydrogen, then the effect would be Paschen-Back. However, if it's in another atom with stronger spin-orbit coupling, then maybe not. But since hydrogen is a common example, and given that the problem might be using hydrogen as the context, perhaps the answer is Paschen-Back. \n\nBut the question is in general, not specifying hydrogen. However, given that the energy difference is given, and assuming that the spin-orbit coupling is of the order of ΔE_SO ~ 10^-4 eV (as in hydrogen), then since ΔE_z = 4.5 × 10^-4 eV is larger than ΔE_SO, it would be Paschen-Back. \n\nTherefore, if we assume that the spin-orbit coupling is smaller than the Zeeman splitting, then it's Paschen-Back. If it's larger, then it's Anomalous Zeeman. Since we don't know, but the given ΔE_z is 4.5 × 10^-4 eV, which is larger than typical spin-orbit coupling in hydrogen, the answer would be Paschen-Back. \n\nBut wait, the Normal Zeeman Effect occurs when there is no spin-orbit coupling, so if the atom has zero spin, then the splitting is Normal Zeeman regardless of the magnetic field strength. Therefore, if the atom in question has zero spin (e.g., a singlet state transition), then even in a strong magnetic field, it would be the Normal Zeeman Effect. \n\nTherefore, the problem is ambiguous without knowing the specific atom or transition. However, given that the question is asking to identify the effect based solely on the energy difference and the calculated magnetic field, and given that the calculated magnetic field is about 7.8 T, which for hydrogen would be in the Paschen-Back regime, but for other atoms with zero spin, it would still be Normal Zeeman. \n\nBut since the question is likely expecting a specific answer, and given that the Paschen-Back Effect is associated with strong magnetic fields where the Zeeman splitting is larger than the spin-orbit coupling, and assuming that the transition is in an atom with non-zero spin and spin-orbit coupling comparable to hydrogen's, then the answer is Paschen-Back. \n\nHowever, to check this, let me calculate the magnetic field required for the Paschen-Back regime. For example, in hydrogen, the fine structure splitting is about 10^-4 eV. The Zeeman splitting is ΔE_z = g * μ_B * B * Δm. For the Paschen-Back Effect, we need ΔE_z > ΔE_SO. Assuming ΔE_SO ≈ 10^-4 eV, then solving for B:\n\nB > ΔE_SO / (g * μ_B * Δm)\n\nAssuming g ≈ 2 (for spin contribution), Δm = 1:\n\nB > 10^-4 eV / (2 * 5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T * 1) ≈ 10^-4 / (1.1576 × 10^-4) ≈ 0.864 T\n\nSo in hydrogen, a magnetic field greater than about 0.86 T would cause the Paschen-Back Effect. Our calculated field is 7.8 T, which is much larger, so definitely in the Paschen-Back regime. Therefore, if the transition is in hydrogen, it's Paschen-Back. If it's in an atom with much larger spin-orbit coupling, say ΔE_SO = 1 eV, then B would need to be on the order of 1 eV / (g * μ_B) ≈ 1 / (2 * 5.788 × 10^-5) ≈ 8,640 T, which is way beyond our 7.8 T. Therefore, for such an atom, the magnetic field is not sufficient for Paschen-Back, and the splitting would be Anomalous Zeeman. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, but given that the Paschen-Back Effect is associated with strong magnetic fields where the Zeeman splitting exceeds the spin-orbit coupling, and since 7.8 T is sufficient for hydrogen (which is a common example), the answer is likely Paschen-Back Effect. \n\nBut wait, the Normal Zeeman Effect is a special case where the spin is zero. If the atom has zero spin, then there is no spin-orbit coupling, and the splitting is purely Normal Zeeman, regardless of the magnetic field strength. Therefore, if the transition is between singlet states (zero total spin), then even in a 7.8 T field, it's the Normal Zeeman Effect. \n\nTherefore, without knowing the specific atom, it's ambiguous. However, given that the question is likely testing the understanding that the Paschen-Back Effect occurs in strong magnetic fields where the Zeeman splitting is larger than the spin-orbit coupling, and assuming that the atom in question has non-zero spin and spin-orbit coupling comparable to hydrogen's, then the answer is Paschen-Back. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the splitting is due to the Normal Zeeman Effect. For example, if the problem is from a textbook chapter discussing the Normal Zeeman Effect, then the answer would be Normal Zeeman. However, since the question asks to determine which effect it is, it's expecting the student to analyze based on the given data. \n\nGiven that the energy difference is given and the calculated magnetic field is about 7.8 T, which is a strong field, and if we assume that the spin-orbit coupling is smaller than this splitting, then it's Paschen-Back. Otherwise, if the spin is zero, it's Normal. \n\nSince the problem doesn't specify, but given that the Anomalous Zeeman Effect would require knowledge of the Landé g-factor which is not provided, and since the splitting is uniform (suggesting either Normal or Paschen-Back), and given that Paschen-Back is in strong fields, I think the intended answer is Paschen-Back Effect with a magnetic field of approximately 7.8 Tesla. \n\nHowever, to be thorough, let me check another angle. The energy difference between adjacent lines in the Normal Zeeman Effect is ΔE = μ_B * B. In the Anomalous Zeeman Effect, it's ΔE = g * μ_B * B. If we don't know g, we can't tell. However, if we can assume that the Landé g-factor is approximately 2 (for a pure spin case), then the magnetic field would be about 3.89 T, which is less strong. However, since the problem gives a specific value, and without additional information, we can't assume g. Therefore, if the problem is designed to use the Normal Zeeman formula, then it's Normal Zeeman. \n\nBut given that the question is asking to determine which effect it is, and given that the calculated field is strong enough for Paschen-Back in hydrogen, and since the Paschen-Back Effect is a strong field regime, I think the intended answer is Paschen-Back. \n\nHowever, there's another possibility. The Anomalous Zeeman Effect can also produce uniform splitting if the Landé g-factor is the same for both levels. For example, if both the upper and lower levels have the same g-factor, then the transition would have uniform splitting. In such a case, the splitting would be ΔE = g * μ_B * B. If the Landé g-factor is, say, 1.5, then the magnetic field would be B = ΔE / (g * μ_B) = 4.5 × 10^-4 / (1.5 * 5.788 × 10^-5) ≈ 4.5 / 0.868 ≈ 5.18 T. \n\nBut again, without knowing g, we can't determine this. Therefore, the problem might be expecting us to assume that it's the Normal Zeeman Effect because it's the simplest case, and the question is testing the ability to calculate the magnetic field using the Bohr magneton. \n\nGiven that the problem is likely from a textbook chapter on the Zeeman Effect, and if it's in a section discussing the Normal Zeeman Effect, then the answer would be Normal Zeeman. If it's in a section discussing the Paschen-Back Effect, then that would be the answer. Since I don't have context, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nGiven that the Paschen-Back Effect is a more advanced topic and the question mentions all three effects, it's possible that the question is testing whether the student can recognize that a strong magnetic field leads to Paschen-Back. Therefore, since the calculated field is 7.8 T, which is strong, and assuming typical spin-orbit coupling, the answer is Paschen-Back. \n\nHowever, to confirm, let me check the typical magnetic field strengths for each effect:\n\n- Normal Zeeman Effect: Weak fields, typically less than 1 Tesla.\n- Anomalous Zeeman Effect: Intermediate fields, could be up to several Tesla.\n- Paschen-Back Effect: Strong fields, typically above several Tesla.\n\nBut this is a rough estimate. For example, some sources say that the Paschen-Back Effect occurs at magnetic fields above 1 Tesla. Given that our calculated field is 7.8 T, which is well above 1 T, it would be in the Paschen-Back regime. Therefore, the answer is Paschen-Back Effect.\n\nTherefore, after considering all possibilities and the context, I conclude that the splitting is due to the Paschen-Back Effect, and the magnetic induction is approximately 7.8 Tesla.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculation for the magnetic field.\n\nΔE_z = 4.50 × 10^-4 eV.\n\nμ_B = 5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T.\n\nB = ΔE_z / μ_B = (4.50 × 10^-4) / (5.788 × 10^-5) = (4.50 / 0.05788) ≈ 77.7 T? Wait, no, wait, 4.50 × 10^-4 divided by 5.788 × 10^-5 is equal to (4.50 / 5.788) × 10^( -4 + 5 ) = 0.777 × 10^1 = 7.77 T. Yes, correct. So 7.77 T, which is approximately 7.8 T.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic induction is approximately 7.8 Tesla.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- The energy difference between adjacent lines is given.\n- Assuming it's due to the Normal Zeeman Effect, the magnetic field is about 7.8 T.\n- Given that this is a strong magnetic field, and assuming the spin-orbit coupling is smaller than this splitting, the effect is Paschen-Back.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the Paschen-Back Effect with B ≈ 7.8 T.\n\nBut to ensure, let me check if there's a way to determine it's Anomalous. For example, if the Landé g-factor is 1.5, then the magnetic field would be 7.8 / 1.5 ≈ 5.2 T, which is still a strong field but not as strong. However, without knowing g, we can't determine this. Since the problem asks to identify the effect, and given the options are Normal, Anomalous, or Paschen-Back, and given that the field is strong enough to be in the Paschen-Back regime for typical atoms, the answer is Paschen-Back.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe effect is the \\boxed{\\text{Paschen-Back Effect}} with a magnetic induction of \\boxed{7.8\\,\\text{T}}.\n</think>"}
