This is a **strong candidate**. The **6H singlet** is likely from **two equivalent methyl groups**, and the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is consistent with a **CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen**. The **1.7 ppm** value is **slightly upfield** for methyl groups but is **plausible** if the methyl groups are near the **anhydride ring** (which is electron-withdrawing), causing a **small downfield shift**.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. So, there's a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. Both have the same molecular formula C13H16O3. Then, the NOESY NMR of the major product shows a cross-peak that's absent in the minor one. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information.\n\nStarting with the dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. Since it's a cis-alkene, maybe the anhydride has some symmetry? The anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the protons in the aromatic or conjugated system are equivalent. Wait, but anhydrides usually have carbonyl groups. Wait, maybe it's not aromatic. Wait, 7 ppm is typical for aromatic protons. Hmm. But if it's an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, maybe the anhydride is cyclic? Like maleic anhydride? Maleic acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Maleic acid dehydrates to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has a cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups and a double bond. Let me check the NMR data for maleic anhydride.\n\nIn maleic anhydride, the 1H NMR would have protons on the double bond. But if it's symmetric, maybe the protons are equivalent? Wait, maleic anhydride has a trans double bond? Wait no, maleic acid is cis, and the anhydride would have a trans double bond? Or maybe the anhydride is symmetric. Let me recall. Maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride with a five-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and one double bond. The structure is like O=C-O-C(=CH)-CH(=O)-O? Wait, maybe not. The actual structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a CH2 group. Wait, no, maleic anhydride is (CH2)CO-O-COCH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Dehydration would remove a water molecule between the two carboxylic acids. So, for maleic acid, the two carboxylic acids are on adjacent carbons, connected by a double bond. Dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. So the structure would be a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a CH2 group. Wait, but the double bond is part of the ring? No, maybe the structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a single bond. Wait, maybe the structure is like O=C-O-C(=CH2)-CO-O? No, perhaps the correct structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a CH2 group. The actual structure of maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride where the two carboxylic acid groups form a five-membered ring. The ring includes two carbonyl groups (C=O) and a CH2 group. The remaining part is a double bond? Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-O-C(=CH2)-CO-O? Not sure. Maybe I should look up the structure of maleic anhydride. But since I can't do that, I'll have to think.\n\nAlternatively, the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. If that's the case, maybe all the protons are equivalent. For example, in maleic anhydride, there are two protons on the CH2 group. If they are equivalent, maybe due to symmetry. If the molecule is symmetric, then those two protons would be equivalent. But maleic anhydride has a trans double bond? Wait, no, the starting acid is cis. So maybe the anhydride has a cis double bond? Or maybe the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl groups. Anyway, the key point is that the anhydride has a single proton peak at 7 ppm. Let's suppose that the anhydride is maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride's 1H NMR typically has a singlet around 7 ppm for the two protons on the CH2 group. Wait, but two protons would give a 2H singlet. However, the problem states that the anhydride has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR. So maybe that's a 2H singlet. Then the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let's see: maleic anhydride has several carbon atoms. The five-membered ring would have two carbonyl carbons, two CH2 carbons (but maybe equivalent?), and maybe the double bond carbon. Wait, maybe there are two types of carbons. For example, the two carbonyl carbons (C=O) would be at higher ppm (like 165 ppm), and the CH2 carbon (maybe at 137 ppm). But there are two CH2 groups? No, in maleic anhydride, there is one CH2 group in the ring. Wait, perhaps the two carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are equivalent. So, in total, there would be two types of carbons: the two carbonyl carbons (equivalent?) and the CH2 carbon. Wait, but in maleic anhydride, the ring is O=C-O-CH2-CH(=O)-O? No, maybe the structure is O=C-O-CH2-CH(=O)-O? Not sure. Maybe the correct structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a single CH2 group. In that case, the carbon atoms would be: two carbonyl carbons (C=O), the CH2 carbon, and two oxygen atoms. But 13C NMR would have peaks for the carbonyl carbons and the CH2 carbon. However, if the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, then there would be two peaks: one for the carbonyl (say 165 ppm) and one for the CH2 (137 ppm). That matches the given data: two peaks in 13C NMR. So the anhydride is likely maleic anhydride.\n\nNow, moving on. The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let me visualize that molecule. The structure is cyclopentadiene with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. So, the cyclopentadiene ring has four methyl groups attached at positions 1,2,3,4. The original cyclopentadiene has a conjugated diene system. But with four methyl groups, it's 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Wait, but the name is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, positions 1 and 3 are the ones with double bonds? Let me think. Cyclopentadiene has a structure like 1,3-pentadiene in a five-membered ring. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4? Wait, no. The standard cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So, the structure is:\n\n1 (CH2) connected to 2 (CH), double bond to 3 (CH), single bond to 4 (CH2), double bond to 5 (CH2), and back to 1. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally as a five-membered ring with alternating double bonds. But with four methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4. So, positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group. Let me imagine the molecule: the ring has a double bond between 1 and 2 (since it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene), and methyl groups on 1,2,3,4. Wait, but in 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4? No, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have a conjugated diene with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4? Or maybe it's a single double bond between 1-3? Wait, the term 1,3-cyclopentadiene might refer to the positions of the methyl groups? No, the name is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the cyclopentadiene part is 1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the cyclopentadiene has a double bond between 1 and 3? Wait, in a five-membered ring, a 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have a double bond between 1-2 and 3-4? Or maybe it's a single double bond between 1-3? But in a five-membered ring, a single double bond between 1-3 would leave two single bonds. But cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. Wait, maybe the correct structure is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So positions 1 and 2 are double bonded, then 3 and 4 are double bonded. Then position 5 is single bonded to position 1 and 4. So the molecule has two double bonds. But with methyl groups on 1,2,3,4. So, each of these positions has a methyl group. Let me try to imagine that. So positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group. The ring has double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So the molecule is:\n\n- Position 1: CH2 (double bonded to 2)\n- Position 2: CH (double bonded to 1 and 3? Wait, no. If the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4, then positions 1-2 and 3-4 are double bonds. Position 5 is single bonded to position 4 and 1. So the structure is like:\n\n1 (CH2) = 2 (CH) - 3 (CH) = 4 (CH2) - 5 (CH2) - back to 1. But with methyl groups on 1,2,3,4. So:\n\n- Position 1: CH2CH3 (methyl group)\n- Position 2: CH(CH3) (but wait, the original is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, so each of those positions has a methyl group. So position 1 has a methyl group on the CH2, position 2 has a methyl on the CH, etc. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think that the molecule is a cyclopentadiene ring (with conjugated double bonds) where each of the four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. Position 5 is the one without a methyl. So the structure is:\n\nCH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. But each of the positions 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group. Wait, position 1 is CH2CH3, position 2 is CH(CH3), position 3 is CH(CH3), position 4 is CH2CH3, and position 5 is CH2. So the molecule would have four methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4, and the ring has conjugated double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. This is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Now, when this reacts with maleic anhydride, what kind of reaction is this?\n\nMaleic anhydride is a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions. The Diels-Alder reaction between a diene and a dienophile. The given molecule, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is a diene. Wait, but cyclopentadiene is already a conjugated diene (with two double bonds?), but with methyl groups. Wait, but the molecule has two double bonds? If it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene, then it's a conjugated diene with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a 1,3-pentadiene in a ring. So, yes, it's a conjugated diene. Maleic anhydride, being a cyclic anhydride with a double bond, would act as a dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring between the diene and the dienophile.\n\nHowever, the cyclopentadiene has two double bonds. Wait, but in the Diels-Alder, you need a conjugated diene (four consecutive atoms with alternating double bonds). Wait, cyclopentadiene as a diene: if it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the structure is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So between positions 1-2-3-4-5-1. Wait, maybe the conjugated diene is the 1-2-3-4 positions, with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, but that's not a conjugated diene because there's a single bond between 2-3. Wait, no. If the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4, then between positions 2-3 is a single bond, and 4-5 is a single bond, and 5-1 is a single bond. Wait, that would not be a conjugated diene. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think again. The correct structure for 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. The standard cyclopentadiene has a conjugated diene with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. But that would mean there's a single bond between 2-3 and 4-5, and another single bond between 5-1. Wait, but that would not be conjugated. Wait, maybe the correct structure is a five-membered ring with a single double bond between 1-2 and another between 3-4, but separated by a single bond between 2-3 and 4-5. That's not conjugated. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is a five-membered ring with a conjugated triene? No, cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. Wait, maybe the structure is actually a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system where the double bonds are between 1-2 and 2-3, making it a 1,2,3-triene? No, that would be three double bonds. Wait, I'm confused. Let me recall that cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene with alternating double bonds. The standard structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, with single bonds between 2-3 and 4-5. Wait, but that would leave the double bonds separated by a single bond, making them conjugated. So, the diene is the 1-2 and 3-4 double bonds, with a single bond between them. But for a Diels-Alder reaction, you need a conjugated diene (four atoms with alternating double bonds). Wait, in the cyclopentadiene, if you have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, then the diene is actually the 1-2-3-4 atoms. Wait, but between 2-3 is a single bond, and between 3-4 is a double bond. So the diene is 1-2 (double), 2-3 (single), 3-4 (double). So that's a conjugated diene (alternating double and single bonds). So the 1,2,3,4 positions form a conjugated diene. Therefore, when reacting with maleic anhydride (the dienophile), the Diels-Alder reaction would occur between the diene and the dienophile.\n\nSo the reaction would form a six-membered ring between the diene and the maleic anhydride. However, since the diene is part of a five-membered ring, the product would be a bicyclic compound. Now, the reaction can proceed in two different ways depending on which double bond is involved in the Diels-Alder. Wait, but in this case, the diene is a conjugated diene with two double bonds. Wait, no, in the cyclopentadiene, there are two double bonds, but the Diels-Alder uses one of them. Wait, perhaps the molecule can act as a diene in two different ways, leading to different products. But in this case, the problem states that two products are formed: a major and a minor. The major product has a cross-peak in NOESY that the minor does not.\n\nNow, the Diels-Alder reaction between the diene and maleic anhydride. Let's think about the possible orientations. The Diels-Alder can proceed in either endo or exo orientation, depending on the dienophile's substituents. Maleic anhydride has two carbonyl groups and a double bond. The endo rule says that the substituents on the dienophile should be on the same face as the newly formed bridge. So, in the case of maleic anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups, the endo product would have these groups on the same side as the bridge.\n\nBut in this case, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The structure is a five-membered ring with four methyl groups. Let me try to draw the possible Diels-Alder adducts. The diene is the conjugated diene (positions 1-2-3-4) with methyl groups on each of those positions. The dienophile is maleic anhydride. The Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring between the diene and the maleic anhydride. The two possible products could be based on the orientation of the diene and dienophile. However, since the diene is symmetric (due to the four methyl groups), maybe there are two different ways to approach the reaction.\n\nWait, but the diene is symmetric? Let me think. If the molecule is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, the structure is symmetric with respect to the double bonds. For example, positions 1 and 4 have methyl groups on CH2 groups, and positions 2 and 3 have methyl groups on CH groups. Depending on how the Diels-Alder occurs, the maleic anhydride could approach from different sides. However, since the diene is symmetric, maybe the two different orientations would lead to different products. But the problem states that there are two products with the same molecular formula. So they must be diastereomers or something like that.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak indicates through-space interactions. In NOESY, cross-peaks arise from nuclei that are close in space. So, in the major product, there is a cross-peak between two protons that are close in space, but in the minor product, this cross-peak is absent or very weak. Therefore, the major product has a conformation where those two protons are close, while the minor product does not.\n\nNow, the question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak. The options are:\n\nA: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nB: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nC: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nD: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure of the products. The starting diene has four methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4. After Diels-Alder with maleic anhydride, the product would have those methyl groups plus the anhydride part. The molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let's check the molecular formula.\n\nOriginal diene: cyclopentadiene is C5H6. With four methyl groups, that's adding 4*(CH3) = 4*CH3 = 4C and 12H. So total for the diene is C5+4C = C9, H6+12H = H18. But wait, the molecular formula of the diene is C5H6 for cyclopentadiene. Adding four methyl groups would be C5H6 + 4CH3 → C9H6 + 4H3? Wait, no. The original cyclopentadiene has five carbon atoms. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) would add 4 carbon atoms and 12 hydrogens. So total carbon: 5 + 4 = 9. Hydrogens: original cyclopentadiene has 6 H. Adding 4 methyl groups adds 4*3 = 12 H, but each methyl group is attached to a carbon in the ring, so replacing one H? Wait, no. The original cyclopentadiene has five carbon atoms. Each methyl group is added to a carbon in the ring. For example, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, each of the four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So each methyl group is attached to a carbon in the ring. So, for each methyl group, we add a -CH3 group. So total carbon in the diene is 5 (ring) + 4 (methyls) = 9. Hydrogens: each methyl group adds 3 H, but the original ring's Hs are replaced? Wait, no. The original cyclopentadiene has five carbons. Each carbon in the ring has a certain number of Hs. When you add a methyl group to a carbon, you're replacing one H on that carbon with a methyl group. For example, if a carbon originally had two Hs, adding a methyl group would replace one H with -CH3, leaving one H. But the exact count depends on the structure. However, for the purpose of the molecular formula, the diene is C9H...? Let me think again. The molecular formula of the diene is C5H6 (cyclopentadiene). Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) would be adding 4*CH3. So total formula would be C5H6 + 4CH3 = C5+4= C9, H6 + 4*3= H18. But wait, that would be C9H18, but that's not correct because when you add a methyl group to a carbon, you're not just adding CH3 but replacing an H. So actually, adding a methyl group to a carbon would be replacing one H with a CH3 group. So each methyl group addition adds 2 Hs (since CH3 - H = CH2). Wait, no. Let me think of it as adding a methyl group to a carbon. Suppose a carbon has one H. Adding a methyl group would be adding CH3, so the total for that carbon would be CH3 and the original H. Wait, but in reality, the original carbon would have a certain number of Hs. For example, in cyclopentadiene, each carbon in the ring has a certain number of Hs. Adding a methyl group would replace one H with a CH3. So for each methyl group added, the total Hs would decrease by 1 (since one H is replaced by CH3, which has 3 Hs). So the net change is +2 H per methyl group. So four methyl groups would add 4*2=8 H. Original cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each adding CH3) would give C5+4= C9, and H6 + 8 = H14. So the diene is C9H14. Then, adding maleic anhydride (C4H2O3). Wait, maleic anhydride is C4H2O3? Let me check. Maleic anhydride is C4H2O3. Yes, because maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and dehydrating to anhydride would remove one H2O. So molecular formula of maleic anhydride is C4H2O3. So the total product would be C9H14 + C4H2O3 = C13H16O3. Which matches the given molecular formula for the products. So the Diels-Alder product is correct.\n\nNow, the structure of the products. The Diels-Alder reaction between the diene and maleic anhydride would form a six-membered ring. The product would have the structure of the diene fused to the maleic anhydride ring. The two products (major and minor) are likely diastereomers arising from different stereochemistry in the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak indicates through-space proximity. In Diels-Alder reactions, the endo and exo products have different spatial arrangements. The endo product has substituents on the same face as the newly formed bridge, while the exo product has them on the opposite face. Depending on the structure, certain protons would be close in space.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. After Diels-Alder with maleic anhydride, the product would have the anhydride ring attached to the diene. Let's consider the positions of the methyl groups.\n\nIn the diene, positions 1,2,3,4 each have methyl groups. After the Diels-Alder, the six-membered ring formed with maleic anhydride would connect to the diene at positions 1-2-3-4. The exact positions depend on how the Diels-Alder proceeds. Assuming the diene is the 1,2,3,4 positions with methyl groups, and the maleic anhydride is the dienophile, the Diels-Alder would connect the diene to the maleic anhydride's double bond.\n\nIn the Diels-Alder product, the methyl groups on positions 1 and 4 (which are the ends of the diene) would be on the same side as the anhydride ring or opposite, depending on the stereochemistry.\n\nNow, the NOESY cross-peak. Let's think about which protons would be close in space. For example, if the major product is the endo, then certain methyl groups would be close to protons on the anhydride ring.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options refer to different proton signals. Let's analyze the possible proton signals in the product.\n\nThe product has the following protons:\n\n- The methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4. Depending on their environment, they might show different signals. For example, positions 1 and 4 might be equivalent if the molecule is symmetric. Similarly, positions 2 and 3 might be equivalent. So, if the molecule is symmetric, we might have two sets of methyl groups: those on positions 1 and 4 (which are CH2 groups?), and those on positions 2 and 3 (which are CH groups?). Wait, the original diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So positions 1 and 4 are likely to have methyl groups on CH2 groups, while positions 2 and 3 have methyl groups on CH groups. But after the Diels-Alder, the structure changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all the methyl groups are equivalent in the product. But given the options, there are 6H singlets and other signals. For example, option A and D mention 6H singlets. A 6H signal would correspond to two equivalent methyl groups (each 3H). So, if there are two equivalent methyl groups, their combined signal would be 6H.\n\nIn the product, if the molecule is symmetric, the methyl groups on positions 1 and 4 might be equivalent, and those on 2 and 3 might be equivalent. So, for example, two sets of two methyl groups each. So, two 6H singlets if each set is equivalent and not coupled. But the options have different possibilities.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (likely methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (maybe a methine proton).\n\nOption B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (maybe a methylene group near oxygen?).\n\nOption C: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\nOption D: Two 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm.\n\nNow, thinking about the structure. The product has the anhydride ring attached to the diene. The anhydride ring has two carbonyl groups and a double bond. The protons on the anhydride part might be in the 3.5 ppm region if they are near oxygen (like a methylene adjacent to an oxygen). Alternatively, protons on the diene part might be in lower ppm.\n\nIf the cross-peak is between a methyl group (6H singlet) and another proton, that suggests that the methyl group is close in space to that other proton. In the Diels-Alder product, if the major product is the endo, then the methyl groups on the \"endo\" side would be close to certain protons in the anhydride ring.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross-peak is between two methyl groups, that would suggest they are close in space. Option D is two 6H singlets, which would be two sets of methyl groups. If they are close in space, that would be a cross-peak between them. But why would that be the case?\n\nLet me think about the structure. Suppose the Diels-Alder product has the anhydride ring attached to the diene in such a way that two methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring. In the endo product, certain methyl groups might be close to each other or to protons on the anhydride ring.\n\nAlternatively, considering the NOESY cross-peak, which indicates spatial proximity. If the major product has a certain conformation where a methyl group is close to a methylene group (for example), that would show a cross-peak.\n\nLet me consider the possible protons in the product. The anhydride part might have protons that are part of the ring. For example, in the Diels-Alder product, the maleic anhydride would have been incorporated into the six-membered ring. The original maleic anhydride has a double bond. In the Diels-Alder product, that double bond becomes part of the six-membered ring. The protons on the six-membered ring might be in the 1.5-3.5 ppm range, depending on their environment.\n\nIf the cross-peak is between a methyl group (6H singlet) and a methylene group (2H singlet at 3.5 ppm), that might correspond to the methyl group being close to the methylene adjacent to the oxygen. This could happen if the methyl group is on the same face as the methylene, leading to through-space interaction.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. Option C is a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. Option D is two 6H singlets. Option A is a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet.\n\nNow, thinking about the possible protons. The methyl groups on the diene might be in the 1 ppm region. If they are in a 6H singlet, that suggests two equivalent methyl groups. The 1.7 ppm might be another methyl group or a methylene. The 3.5 ppm is likely a methylene adjacent to an oxygen (since that's a typical chemical shift for such protons).\n\nIn the Diels-Alder product, if the anhydride ring is attached to the diene, there might be a methylene group adjacent to the anhydride ring. For example, in the six-membered ring formed by Diels-Alder, there might be a CH2 group next to the anhydride oxygen. That CH2 would have protons around 3.5 ppm. If a methyl group is close to this CH2 in space, there would be a NOESY cross-peak between them.\n\nSo, if the major product has a methyl group close to this CH2 group, then option B (6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm) or option D (if two methyl groups are close). But option D is two 6H singlets, which would be two methyl groups close to each other. But why would two methyl groups be close? Maybe if they are on adjacent carbons in the ring, but given the symmetry, maybe in the endo product they are on the same face.\n\nAlternatively, option B: a methyl group (6H) and a CH2 (2H). If the methyl group is close to the CH2 adjacent to the anhydride oxygen, that would make sense. The 6H singlet would be from two equivalent methyl groups (like those on positions 1 and 4 of the diene), and the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm is from the CH2 adjacent to oxygen.\n\nBut why would the methyl group be close to the CH2? In the endo product, the methyl groups on the same face as the anhydride bridge would be close to the anhydride part. So, if the methyl groups are on the same side as the anhydride ring, they would be close to the protons on the anhydride ring. For example, if the methyl groups are near the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen, then a NOESY cross-peak would exist between them.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross-peak is between two methyl groups, like option D, that would suggest they are close in space. For example, if two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons in the ring and are on the same face, they might be close enough for a NOESY cross-peak. But the options for D are two 6H singlets. If those are from two different sets of methyl groups, like those on positions 1 and 4 (each a 6H singlet if they are equivalent), but why would they be close? If the molecule is folded in a way that these two methyl groups are close, but that depends on the conformation.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the cross-peak is present in the major product but not in the minor. This suggests that the major product has a specific spatial arrangement that the minor lacks. In Diels-Alder reactions, the endo product is usually the major product due to the favorable orbital interactions. So, the endo product would have the methyl groups on the same face as the anhydride bridge, making them close to the anhydride protons. Whereas the exo product would have the methyl groups on the opposite face, making them farther away.\n\nSo, if the major product is the endo, then the methyl groups on the same face as the anhydride bridge would be close to the protons on the anhydride ring. For example, if the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen is in the anhydride ring, its protons would be near the methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak would be between the methyl protons (6H singlet) and the CH2 protons (2H singlet at 3.5 ppm), which is option B. Alternatively, if the methyl protons are at ~1 ppm and the CH2 is at ~1.5 ppm, but the options have different ppm values.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\nOption D: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\nIf the methyl groups are at ~1 ppm (option D), and another set at ~1.7 ppm, but why would they be close? Maybe if they are on adjacent carbons. However, the NOESY cross-peak between two methyl groups would require them to be close in space. In the endo product, maybe two methyl groups are close. For example, if the molecule is folded such that two methyl groups are near each other. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm is the CH2 adjacent to the anhydride oxygen. If that CH2 is close to the methyl groups at 1 ppm, then the cross-peak would be between them. But the options have the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm (option B) instead of 1 ppm. Maybe the methyl groups are at 1.7 ppm? That would be unusual for methyl groups, which are usually at lower ppm (like 1 ppm). Unless they are near electronegative atoms.\n\nWait, the 1.7 ppm is a bit higher than typical methyl protons. Typical methyl protons are around 0.8-1.5 ppm. If they are near a carbonyl or oxygen, they might shift upfield or downfield. For example, if the methyl group is adjacent to an oxygen, it might shift downfield. But 1.7 ppm is still relatively low. Maybe the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm is not methyl groups but something else. But 6H would imply two equivalent CH3 groups. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the 6H singlet is at 1 ppm, that would be typical for methyl groups. The 1.5 ppm could be a methine proton (CH) that is a doublet due to coupling. But the options have a 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm (option A) and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm (option B).\n\nIf the cross-peak is between a methyl group (6H at 1 ppm) and a methine proton (1H at 1.5 ppm), that would be option A. But why would they be close? Maybe if they are on adjacent carbons in the ring.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross-peak is between the methyl group and the CH2 at 3.5 ppm, that's option B.\n\nTo decide between these, let's think about the structure. In the Diels-Alder product, the anhydride ring would be attached to the diene. The six-membered ring formed by Diels-Alder would have the anhydride's double bond incorporated. The protons on this ring would be in the 1.5-3.5 ppm range. The methyl groups on the original diene would be in the 1 ppm region. If the methyl group is close to a CH2 adjacent to the anhydride oxygen, then there would be a cross-peak between them. This would be option B if the methyl is at 1.7 ppm, but that seems odd. Or maybe the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm is not methyl groups but something else. Wait, maybe the 6H singlet is from two equivalent CH2 groups? No, 6H would be three CH2 groups or two CH3 groups. If it's two CH3 groups, then it's likely at lower ppm. So maybe there's a mistake in the options' ppm values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm is from two CH2 groups with three protons each? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 6H would be six protons, so two equivalent CH3 groups (each 3H) would give a total of 6H. If they are at 1.7 ppm, that might be due to being near the anhydride ring, causing a slight downfield shift. So maybe it's possible.\n\nIf the methyl groups are at 1.7 ppm and close to the CH2 at 3.5 ppm, then option B is correct. Alternatively, if the methyl groups are at 1 ppm and close to the CH2 at 3.5 ppm, but the option doesn't have that. The options have A: 1 ppm and 1.5 ppm, B: 1.7 ppm and 3.5 ppm, etc.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the integrals. The molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let's count the protons in the product. The diene part has 16 - (protons from anhydride). Wait, the product has the same molecular formula as the starting materials combined: C9H14 (diene) + C4H2O3 (maleic anhydride) = C13H16O3. So the product has 16 protons. Let's think about how they are distributed.\n\nThe diene has four methyl groups (each CH3) and the rest of the structure. After the Diels-Alder, the anhydride is attached. The protons would include:\n\n- The four methyl groups from the diene. If they are two equivalent sets of two methyl groups each, that's 2*(2*3) = 12 H.\n\n- The remaining protons would come from the rest of the molecule. The total is 16 H, so 16 - 12 = 4 H left. These could be from the six-membered ring and the anhydride part.\n\nThe six-membered ring from the Diels-Alder would have some protons. For example, if it's a cyclohexene ring with certain substituents. The anhydride part has two carbonyl groups and a double bond. The protons in the anhydride part might be part of the six-membered ring.\n\nAssuming the six-membered ring has four protons (since total is 16, and 12 from methyls), then those four protons could be, for example, two CH2 groups (each 2H) or other combinations.\n\nIf there is a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm, that could be one CH2 group adjacent to oxygen. Another CH2 group might be at a lower ppm. But the integrals in the options need to add up to the total protons.\n\nOption B suggests a 6H (methyls) and a 2H (CH2), totaling 8 H. But the total protons in the product are 16, so there are other protons not mentioned in the options. The question is about which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak, not all protons.\n\nThe options are specific to certain signals. The key is to determine which two signals are close in space in the major product.\n\nGiven that the major product is likely the endo, and the cross-peak indicates proximity between methyl groups and a CH2 adjacent to oxygen, option B seems plausible. The 6H singlet would be from two methyl groups (positions 1 and 4, perhaps), and the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm is from the CH2 adjacent to the anhydride oxygen. These two would be close in the endo product.\n\nAlternatively, option D suggests two 6H singlets, which would be two sets of methyl groups. If they are close in space, that could be the case if the molecule is folded such that these methyl groups are near each other. However, this is less likely compared to a methyl group being close to a CH2 group near an oxygen.\n\nAnother angle: the 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm (option A and C) would correspond to a methine proton (CH), which might be part of the six-membered ring. If this CH is close to a methyl group, that could be a cross-peak. But why would it be a doublet? It might be coupled to another proton, suggesting it's adjacent to another CH or CH2.\n\nHowever, without more structural information, it's challenging. But given the typical Diels-Alder products and NOESY cross-peaks, the most plausible is option B: the methyl groups (6H) close to the CH2 (2H) adjacent to oxygen. This would make sense in the endo product where the methyl groups are on the same face as the anhydride ring, leading to proximity with the CH2 protons.\n</think>"}
