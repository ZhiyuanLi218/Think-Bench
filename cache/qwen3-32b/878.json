This step is essential because it removes the organic material and releases the iodide ions (I⁻) from the kelp into a form that can be chemically extracted and analyzed.\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  This statement is **correct**. Ashing is a necessary step in the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Option (B):**  \n> *\"When separating iron ions and copper ions using the paper chromatography method, the sample spot on the filter paper strip cannot be immersed in the developing solvent.\"*\n\n- **Analysis:**  \n  In **paper chromatography**, the sample spot must be placed **above the level of the developing solvent**. If it is immersed, the sample dissolves directly into the solvent and does not migrate up the paper, resulting in no separation.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  This statement is **correct**. The spot must not be submerged in the solvent.\n\n---\n\n### **Option (C):**  \n> *\"When a test tube containing a turbid mixture of phenol and water is immersed in hot water at $80^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for a period of time, the turbid mixture becomes clear.\"*\n\n- **Analysis:**  \n  At room temperature, phenol and water are only partially miscible and form a **cloudy (turbid)** mixture. However, when heated above their **consolute temperature** (approximately **66°C**), phenol and water become fully miscible and form a **clear solution**. At **80°C**, the mixture should indeed become clear.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  This statement is **correct**. The mixture will become clear at 80°C.\n\n---\n\n### **Option (D):**  \n> *\"Leftover pieces of sodium metal used in the laboratory cannot be returned to the original reagent bottle.\"*\n\n- **Analysis:**  \n  Sodium is **highly reactive** with water and air. Leftover sodium, especially if it has been exposed to air or moisture, may be **contaminated** and **dangerous** to return to the original reagent bottle. Returning it could cause a **violent reaction** if any moisture is present in the bottle.\n\n  Laboratory safety guidelines generally **prohibit** returning reactive metals like sodium to their original storage.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  This statement is **correct**. Leftover sodium should **not** be returned to the original bottle.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Evaluation:\n\nAll four statements are **correct** in the context of standard laboratory practice and chemical theory. Therefore, **none of the statements are incorrect**.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to identify the **incorrect** statements. Given that all four are correct, the question is either flawed or is a **trick question** where the correct answer is that **none of the options are incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{All statements are correct; none are incorrect.}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which of these statements are incorrect. I need to go through each option one by one and analyze them based on my knowledge of chemistry experiments.\n\nStarting with option (A): \"In the 'Separation and detection of iodine elements in kelp' experiment using the burning method, the kelp must be ashed.\" Hmm, I remember that in the kelp experiment, we usually burn the kelp to ash it. Ashing is part of the process to break down the organic material and release the iodine compounds. So, maybe this is correct. Wait, but the question says which statements are incorrect. If the statement says \"must be ashed,\" and that's part of the process, then (A) would be correct, not incorrect. But maybe I'm mixing up steps. Let me think again. The process involves burning the kelp to produce ash, which is then treated with acid to dissolve the iodide ions. So yes, the kelp must be ashed. So (A) is correct, so it's not an incorrect statement. Therefore, if the question is asking which are incorrect, then (A) is correct, so it's not an answer.\n\nOption (B): \"When separating iron ions and copper ions using the paper chromatography method, the sample spot on the filter paper strip cannot be immersed in the developing solvent.\" In paper chromatography, the sample spot should be above the solvent level so that the solvent can travel up the paper by capillary action. If the spot is immersed, the sample might dissolve into the solvent and not move up, leading to poor separation. So the statement is correct. Therefore, (B) is correct, so it's not an incorrect statement. Wait, but the question is about incorrect statements. So if (B) is correct, then it's not the answer.\n\nOption (C): \"When a test tube containing a turbid mixture of phenol and water is immersed in hot water at 80°C for a period of time, the turbid mixture becomes clear.\" Phenol and water are immiscible at room temperature, forming a cloudy mixture. However, when heated above their mutual solubility temperature (which is around 66°C, I think), they form a clear solution. So heating to 80°C would make it clear. Therefore, (C) is correct. So it's not an incorrect statement. So not the answer.\n\nOption (D): \"Leftover pieces of sodium metal used in the laboratory cannot be returned to the original reagent bottle.\" Sodium is highly reactive with water and air. If you return leftover sodium to the reagent bottle, it could react with any moisture or contaminants inside, causing a hazard. Therefore, leftover sodium should not be returned. The statement says they cannot be returned, which is correct. Therefore, (D) is correct, so not an incorrect statement.\n\nWait, but all options are correct? That can't be. The question says the following statements are incorrect, so at least one of them is wrong. Maybe I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nLet me check again. Let's go through each again.\n\nOption (A): \"must be ashed.\" In the kelp experiment, yes, the kelp is burned to ash. So (A) is correct. So the statement is correct, not incorrect.\n\nOption (B): Sample spot cannot be immersed in developing solvent. Yes, because if it's immersed, the sample dissolves in the solvent and doesn't move up the paper. So the statement is correct. Therefore, (B) is correct.\n\nOption (C): Phenol and water mixture becomes clear at 80°C. Phenol has a solubility in water that increases with temperature. At room temperature, phenol is only slightly soluble, but above the consolute temperature (~66°C), it becomes miscible. So heating to 80°C would make the mixture clear. Therefore, (C) is correct.\n\nOption (D): Leftover sodium cannot be returned. Yes, because returning reactive metals like sodium could cause reactions. So (D) is correct.\n\nWait, but the question says the following statements are incorrect. But according to my analysis, all are correct. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake with one of them.\n\nWait, maybe (D) is incorrect. Let me think again. If sodium is left over, what do you do with it? You can't return it to the reagent bottle because it's contaminated. Also, returning reactive metals can be dangerous. So the statement says they cannot be returned. Therefore, (D) is correct. So all statements are correct? But the question is asking which are incorrect. That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps option (A) is incorrect. Let me check the kelp experiment again. The process is: kelp is burned to ash, then treated with acid to release iodide ions. So if the statement says \"must be ashed,\" then yes, that's correct. So (A) is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe in some methods, they don't ash it but use other methods. But the standard method uses ashing. So the statement is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (D) is incorrect. Suppose in some cases, small pieces can be returned if they are not contaminated. But generally, sodium is not returned. So (D) is correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the incorrect one is (D). Let me check. For sodium, leftover pieces should be disposed of properly, not returned to the bottle. So the statement says they cannot be returned, which is correct. So (D) is correct.\n\nBut the problem says the following statements are incorrect. If all are correct, then none are incorrect, but that's not possible. The options are (A)-(D), and the question is which are incorrect. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake with one of the options.\n\nWait, maybe (C) is incorrect. Let me think again. Phenol and water form a cloudly solution at room temperature because they are immiscible. When heated above the consolute temperature (~66°C), they become miscible and form a clear solution. So heating to 80°C would make it clear. Therefore, (C) is correct.\n\nHmm. All statements are correct? But the question is presented as a multiple-choice question where one or more are incorrect. Maybe the problem is that the question is in Chinese, and there's a translation issue. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption (D): Leftover sodium cannot be returned. In lab practice, sodium is usually stored in mineral oil or paraffin. If you have leftover sodium, you should not return it to the original bottle because it may have reacted with air or moisture, making it impure. So the statement is correct. Therefore, (D) is correct.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is (D). Suppose in some cases, you can return it if it's not contaminated. But generally, it's not safe. So the statement is correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake with option (A). Let me check again. The experiment to separate iodine from kelp: The process is to burn the kelp to ash, then add acid and oxidizing agent to release iodine. So the kelp must be ashed. Therefore, (A) is correct.\n\nBut the question is about incorrect statements. If all are correct, then none are incorrect, but that's not possible. There must be an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, maybe (B) is incorrect. Let me think. In paper chromatography, the sample spot must not be immersed in the developing solvent. Yes, because if it's immersed, the sample dissolves into the solvent and doesn't move up the paper. So the statement (B) is correct. Therefore, all statements are correct. But the question is asking which are incorrect. This suggests that there's a mistake in the options or in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. If all statements are correct, then the answer is none of them are incorrect. But since the options are given, and the question is presented as having incorrect ones, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe (A) is incorrect. Suppose the experiment doesn't require ashing, but uses another method. But in standard practice, burning the kelp to ash is necessary to release the iodide ions. So (A) is correct.\n\nWait, maybe (D) is incorrect. Suppose that leftover sodium can be returned to the original bottle. But that's dangerous because of contamination. So the statement (D) is correct.\n\nThis is perplexing. All options seem correct. But the question states that the following statements are incorrect. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake with one of them.\n\nWait, maybe (C) is incorrect. Phenol and water form a clear solution when heated. But phenol is a weak acid, and maybe when heated, it's still immiscible. No, the consolute temperature is around 66°C, so at 80°C, they are miscible. So (C) is correct.\n\nWait, maybe (D) is incorrect. Suppose that in the lab, leftover sodium can be returned to the bottle. But no, because sodium is reactive. So the statement is correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. According to my analysis, all statements are correct, but the question implies that some are incorrect. Maybe there's a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps one of the statements is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nOption (A): \"must be ashed.\" If the experiment uses a different method, like dissolving in a solvent without ashing, then (A) would be incorrect. But the standard method for kelp iodine extraction involves ashing. So (A) is correct.\n\nOption (B): Sample spot not immersed in solvent. Correct.\n\nOption (C): Phenol and water clear at 80°C. Correct.\n\nOption (D): Leftover sodium cannot be returned. Correct.\n\nSo all are correct. Therefore, the answer is none of the options are incorrect. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is (D). Maybe in some lab practices, it's allowed to return small pieces. But generally, it's not safe. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a specific textbook or source where one of these is considered incorrect. For example, maybe in option (A), the kelp doesn't need to be ashed. But I'm not sure. Given the information I have, I think all statements are correct, but since the question says they are incorrect, perhaps the answer is (D). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) is incorrect, and the correct practice is to return it. But I don't think so.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is (D). Let me check a lab manual. Sodium is highly reactive, and leftover pieces should be disposed of properly, not returned to the bottle. Therefore, (D) is correct. So the answer is none of the options are incorrect. But that's not possible. Maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is all are correct. But since the options are given, maybe the answer is (D). I'm really confused now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (A). Suppose that in the experiment, the kelp doesn't need to be ashed. But no, the process requires ashing to release the iodide. So (A) is correct.\n\nGiven that, I have to conclude that all statements are correct, but the question is flawed. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, and I have to choose from the options, maybe the intended answer is (D). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (A). Wait, if the kelp is not ashed but just boiled, but no, the standard method uses ashing. So I'm stuck. Given my analysis, all options are correct, but since the question asks for incorrect ones, maybe the answer is (D). But I'm not confident.\n</think>"}
