The problem gives me two equations:\n\nFirst, xy + x + y = 71.\n\nSecond, x²y + xy² = 880.\n\nHmm, let me think. These equations look a bit complex, but maybe I can manipulate them to find x and y. Let me start with the first equation. \n\nThe first equation is xy + x + y = 71. I remember that sometimes adding 1 to both sides can help factor expressions. Let me try that:\n\nxy + x + y + 1 = 72.\n\nNow, if I factor the left side, does it factor nicely? Let's see:\n\nxy + x + y + 1 = (x + 1)(y + 1). Yes! Because if you expand (x + 1)(y + 1), you get xy + x + y + 1. Perfect!\n\nSo, (x + 1)(y + 1) = 72. That seems useful. Maybe I can use this later.\n\nNow, looking at the second equation: x²y + xy² = 880. Let me factor that. Both terms have xy, so:\n\nxy(x + y) = 880.\n\nSo, xy(x + y) = 880. \n\nNow, if I let S = x + y and P = xy, maybe I can rewrite both equations in terms of S and P. Let me try that.\n\nFrom the first equation, we had (x + 1)(y + 1) = 72. Expanding that gives xy + x + y + 1 = 72, which is P + S + 1 = 72. Therefore, P + S = 71. Wait, that's just the original first equation. So maybe that substitution isn't giving me anything new yet.\n\nBut the second equation is P * S = 880. Because S is x + y and P is xy, so P*S = xy(x + y) which is exactly the left-hand side of the second equation. So, we have:\n\nEquation 1: P + S = 71\n\nEquation 2: P * S = 880\n\nSo now we have two equations with variables S and P. Let me write them down:\n\n1. P + S = 71\n\n2. P * S = 880\n\nSo, if I can solve for S and P, then maybe I can find x and y. Since x and y are positive integers, S and P must also be positive integers. \n\nThis looks like a system of equations where S and P are roots of the quadratic equation t² - (S + P)t + S*P = 0. Wait, no. Let me recall: if we have two numbers with sum Q and product R, then they are roots of t² - Qt + R = 0. But here, we have S and P with sum 71 and product 880. Therefore, S and P are roots of t² - 71t + 880 = 0.\n\nLet me try solving this quadratic equation for t. Let's compute the discriminant:\n\nD = 71² - 4*1*880.\n\nCalculating 71²: 70² + 2*70 + 1 = 4900 + 140 + 1 = 5041.\n\nThen 4*880 = 3520.\n\nSo D = 5041 - 3520 = 1521. \n\nWhat is the square root of 1521? Let me think. 39² is 1521 because 40² is 1600, and 39² = 1521. Yes. So sqrt(1521) = 39.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are t = [71 ± 39]/2.\n\nCalculating:\n\nFirst solution: (71 + 39)/2 = 110/2 = 55.\n\nSecond solution: (71 - 39)/2 = 32/2 = 16.\n\nTherefore, S and P are 55 and 16. But which one is which?\n\nWe have S = x + y and P = xy. Since S and P are positive integers, and x and y are positive integers, we need to check which combination works. Let me note that S must be greater than P? Not necessarily. Let me think.\n\nBut let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S = 55 and P = 16.\n\nSo x + y = 55 and xy = 16.\n\nBut if x and y are positive integers adding up to 55 and multiplying to 16, then we can try solving for them. The quadratic equation would be t² - 55t + 16 = 0. The discriminant would be 55² - 4*16 = 3025 - 64 = 2961. Let me check if that's a perfect square. Hmm, sqrt(2961)... Well, 54² is 2916, 55² is 3025. So between 54 and 55. Not a perfect square. Therefore, no integer solutions here. So this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: S = 16 and P = 55.\n\nSo x + y = 16 and xy = 55. Let's check if there are integer solutions here. The quadratic equation is t² - 16t + 55 = 0.\n\nDiscriminant: 256 - 220 = 36. sqrt(36) = 6. Therefore, solutions are [16 ± 6]/2 = 22/2 = 11 and 10/2 = 5. Therefore, x and y are 11 and 5. Since they are positive integers, this works. \n\nTherefore, S = 16 and P = 55. Therefore, x + y = 16 and xy = 55. Therefore, x and y are 5 and 11. \n\nTherefore, x² + y² is 5² + 11² = 25 + 121 = 146. \n\nWait, but let me check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: xy + x + y = 55 + 16 - 1? Wait, original first equation is xy + x + y = 55 + (x + y)? Wait, no. Wait, original first equation is given as 71. Wait, but according to our previous steps, P + S = 55 + 16 = 71. Which matches the first equation. So that's correct. \n\nSecond equation: xy(x + y) = 55 * 16 = 880. Which is exactly the second equation. So that's correct. Therefore, x and y are 5 and 11, so x² + y² is 25 + 121 = 146. Therefore, the answer is 146.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me verify with actual x and y.\n\nLet me take x = 5, y = 11.\n\nFirst equation: 5*11 + 5 + 11 = 55 + 5 + 11 = 71. Correct.\n\nSecond equation: (5² * 11) + (5 * 11²) = 25*11 + 5*121 = 275 + 605 = 880. Correct. \n\nAlternatively, x = 11, y = 5. Same result.\n\nTherefore, x² + y² is 5² + 11² = 25 + 121 = 146. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 146.\n\nBut let me think again if there could be other possibilities. For example, when we solved for S and P, we had two possibilities but only one worked. But just to make sure there are no other factorizations or something.\n\nWait, originally, we had (x + 1)(y + 1) = 72. Maybe I can approach the problem from that angle as well, just to cross-verify.\n\nSo if (x + 1)(y + 1) = 72, and x and y are positive integers, then x + 1 and y + 1 are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, and their product is 72. So we can list all pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that a*b = 72, a ≥ 2, b ≥ 2, and then subtract 1 from each to get x and y. Then check which of those pairs satisfy the second equation.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFirst, factor pairs of 72 (since a and b are positive integers greater than or equal to 2):\n\n1*72, but since a and b must be at least 2, starting from:\n\n2*36, 3*24, 4*18, 6*12, 8*9. Also considering the reverse, but since x and y are interchangeable, we can consider them once.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\nCase 1: (2, 36). Then x = a - 1 = 1, y = b - 1 = 35. Check if xy(x + y) equals 880?\n\nCompute xy(x + y): 1*35*(1 + 35) = 35*36 = 1260 ≠ 880. Not good.\n\nCase 2: (3, 24). x = 2, y = 23. xy(x + y) = 2*23*(25) = 46*25 = 1150 ≠ 880.\n\nCase 3: (4, 18). x = 3, y = 17. xy(x + y) = 3*17*20 = 51*20 = 1020 ≠ 880.\n\nCase 4: (6, 12). x = 5, y = 11. Then xy(x + y) = 5*11*(16) = 55*16 = 880. Which matches! So this is our solution. \n\nCase 5: (8, 9). x = 7, y = 8. Then xy(x + y) = 7*8*15 = 56*15 = 840 ≠ 880. \n\nOther factor pairs would be duplicates, like (9,8), (12,6), etc., which we already checked.\n\nTherefore, only the case (6,12) gives us the correct second equation. Therefore, x and y are 5 and 11, leading to x² + y² = 25 + 121 = 146. \n\nSo both methods confirm that the answer is 146. Therefore, I can be confident that 146 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check if there are other factor pairs if we consider 1*72. Although x and y are positive integers, so x + 1 and y + 1 can technically be 1 and 72, but then x would be 0, which is not positive. Since the problem states x and y are positive integers, we can disregard those. Similarly for 72*1. So all possible pairs are considered. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 146.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{146}\n</think>"}
