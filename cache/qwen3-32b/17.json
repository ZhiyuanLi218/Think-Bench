Inertial mass is defined as the **resistance of an object to changes in its state of motion**, which is precisely what is being measured in this experiment.\n\n   - **Gravitational mass**, on the other hand, refers to how much gravitational force an object experiences in a gravitational field. While in practice, gravitational and inertial mass are equivalent (as per the **equivalence principle** in physics), the method of measurement is different. In this case, the measurement is based on applying a force and measuring the resulting acceleration—so it’s a measurement of **inertial mass**.\n\n3. **Eliminating the Other Options**:\n   - **Weight** is a force, not a mass, and is defined as $ W = mg $. It is not a quantity measured by the slope of this graph.\n   - **Velocity** is a kinematic quantity and is not directly related to the slope of a force vs. acceleration graph.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe **slope** of a graph with **net force on the vertical axis** and **acceleration on the horizontal axis** gives the **inertial mass** of the object.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which quantity is measured by the slope of a graph where net force is on the vertical axis and acceleration is on the horizontal axis. The options are gravitational mass, weight, velocity, or inertial mass. Let me start by recalling some basic physics concepts.\n\nFirst, Newton's second law comes to mind. It states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass times acceleration, right? So F = ma. In this equation, F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. If I rearrange that equation to solve for mass, it would be m = F/a. Wait, but the question is about the slope of a graph where force is on the vertical axis and acceleration is on the horizontal. The slope of a graph is calculated as rise over run, which would be F/a here. So if I plot F vs. a, the slope is F/a, which equals mass. So the slope would give mass. But which type of mass?\n\nThe options are gravitational mass and inertial mass. I remember that inertial mass is the mass in Newton's second law, which resists acceleration. Gravitational mass is the one in Newton's law of universal gravitation, which relates to how much gravity an object experiences. But in most cases, like in an experiment where you apply a force and measure acceleration, you're dealing with inertial mass. So the slope here would be inertial mass. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.\n\nWeight is the force due to gravity, so that's mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. So weight is a force, not mass. Velocity is acceleration times time, but that's not related here. So the options are between gravitational mass and inertial mass. Since the experiment involves applying a net force and measuring acceleration, which directly relates to Newton's second law, the mass obtained here is the inertial mass. Therefore, the slope of the F vs. a graph gives inertial mass. So the answer should be D: Inertial mass.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in experiments, when you use a spring scale, are you measuring gravitational mass? For example, if you hang an object on a spring scale, it measures the weight, which is mg, so if you know g, you can find mass. But in this case, the question says the spring scale is measuring the net force applied. So maybe the setup is different. The spring scale measures the net force, not just the weight. So if you're applying a net force and measuring acceleration, then using F=ma, the slope is mass. Since this is about resistance to acceleration, it's inertial mass. So yeah, D makes sense.\n\nAnother thought: Einstein's equivalence principle states that gravitational mass and inertial mass are equivalent, but in experiments, when you measure mass by applying a force and measuring acceleration, you're determining inertial mass. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
