So, the question is about the probability of rain on Saturday and Sunday. We need to find the probability that it rains at least one day this weekend, and then express that as a reduced fraction a/b and find a + b. \n\nFirst, let me parse the information given:\n\n- Probability of rain on Saturday is 40%, which is 0.4. Let me denote Saturday rain as event S, and Sunday rain as event N. So P(S) = 0.4, and P(N) = 0.3. \n\nBut there's a catch: it says \"it is twice as likely to rain on Sunday if it rains on Saturday than if it does not rain on Saturday.\" Hmm, okay. So that's a conditional probability statement. So, the probability of rain on Sunday given that it rained on Saturday is twice the probability of rain on Sunday given that it did not rain on Saturday. \n\nSo, in symbols, P(N | S) = 2 * P(N | not S). \n\nBut we also know the overall probability of rain on Sunday is 30%, which is P(N) = 0.3. \n\nSo maybe we can use the law of total probability here? Let me recall that formula. The total probability of N is equal to P(N | S) * P(S) + P(N | not S) * P(not S). \n\nYes, so that should let us solve for P(N | S) and P(N | not S). Let me write that down:\n\nP(N) = P(N | S) * P(S) + P(N | not S) * P(not S)\n\nWe know P(N) is 0.3, P(S) is 0.4, so P(not S) is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. And we know that P(N | S) = 2 * P(N | not S). Let me denote P(N | not S) as x. Then P(N | S) is 2x. \n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n0.3 = 2x * 0.4 + x * 0.6\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.3 = 0.8x + 0.6x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n0.3 = 1.4x\n\nTherefore, x = 0.3 / 1.4. Let me calculate that. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 0.1: 3 / 14 ≈ 0.214285...\n\nSo x is 3/14, which is P(N | not S). Therefore, P(N | S) is 2x = 6/14 = 3/7 ≈ 0.42857...\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If it rains on Saturday, then the chance of rain on Sunday is 3/7 ≈ 42.86%, and if it doesn't rain on Saturday, it's 3/14 ≈ 21.43%. Let's verify that the total probability is indeed 0.3:\n\nP(N) = P(N | S) * P(S) + P(N | not S) * P(not S) = (3/7)(0.4) + (3/14)(0.6)\n\nConvert 0.4 and 0.6 to fractions to make it easier. 0.4 is 2/5, 0.6 is 3/5. Wait, but maybe decimals are easier here. Let me compute:\n\n(3/7)(0.4) is approximately 0.4 * 0.42857 ≈ 0.1714\n\n(3/14)(0.6) is approximately 0.2143 * 0.6 ≈ 0.1286\n\nAdding them together: 0.1714 + 0.1286 ≈ 0.3, which checks out. Good.\n\nSo now, we need to find the probability that it rains at least one day this weekend. That is P(S or N). \n\nWe know that P(S or N) = P(S) + P(N) - P(S and N). \n\nWe know P(S) is 0.4, P(N) is 0.3, so we need to find P(S and N). \n\nBut P(S and N) is equal to P(N | S) * P(S). Which we already calculated earlier. \n\nEarlier, we found that P(N | S) is 3/7, so P(S and N) = 3/7 * 0.4. Let me compute that. \n\nAgain, 0.4 is 2/5. So 3/7 * 2/5 = 6/35 ≈ 0.1714. Which matches our earlier approximate calculation. \n\nTherefore, P(S or N) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 6/35. Let me convert all terms to fractions to avoid decimal errors. \n\n0.4 is 2/5, 0.3 is 3/10. \n\nSo:\n\nP(S or N) = 2/5 + 3/10 - 6/35\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. Let's find the least common denominator of 5, 10, and 35. The prime factors:\n\n- 5 is 5\n- 10 is 2 * 5\n- 35 is 5 * 7\n\nSo LCD is 2 * 5 * 7 = 70. \n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n2/5 = (2 * 14)/(5 * 14) = 28/70\n\n3/10 = (3 * 7)/(10 * 7) = 21/70\n\n6/35 = (6 * 2)/(35 * 2) = 12/70\n\nTherefore, P(S or N) = 28/70 + 21/70 - 12/70 = (28 + 21 - 12)/70 = (49 - 12)/70 = 37/70.\n\nWait, 28 + 21 is 49? Wait, 28 + 21 is 49? Wait, 28 + 21 is 49? Wait, 28 + 21 = 49? Wait, 20 + 20 is 40, 8 + 1 is 9, so yes, 49. Then 49 - 12 is 37. So 37/70. \n\nIs 37 and 70 coprime? Let's check. 37 is a prime number, right? 37 divides 70? 37*1=37, 37*2=74>70. So no. Therefore, 37 and 70 share no common divisors except 1. Therefore, the fraction is reduced, so a is 37, b is 70, so a + b is 107. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when converting fractions, mistakes can happen. Let me verify each step again.\n\nOriginal formula: P(S or N) = P(S) + P(N) - P(S and N). \n\nP(S) is 0.4, which is 2/5. P(N) is 0.3, which is 3/10. \n\nP(S and N) is P(N | S) * P(S) = (3/7) * (2/5) = 6/35. \n\nSo converting all to 70 denominator:\n\n2/5 is 28/70, 3/10 is 21/70, 6/35 is 12/70. \n\nSo 28 + 21 = 49. 49 - 12 = 37. So 37/70. \n\nYes, that seems correct. 37 is prime, so 37 and 70 have no common factors. So yes, the answer is 37/70, so a + b = 37 + 70 = 107. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me approach this problem another way to confirm. \n\nAnother way to compute P(S or N) is 1 - P(not S and not N). Let me compute that. \n\nSo P(not S and not N) = P(not S) * P(not N | not S). Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Wait, P(not N | not S) is not directly given. Wait, but we can compute P(not N | not S) = 1 - P(N | not S) = 1 - 3/14 = 11/14. \n\nBut is P(not S and not N) equal to P(not S) * P(not N | not S)? Yes, because if we think of it as:\n\nP(not S and not N) = P(not S) * P(not N | not S). \n\nTherefore, P(not S and not N) = 0.6 * (11/14). Let me compute that. \n\n0.6 is 3/5. So 3/5 * 11/14 = 33/70. Therefore, P(S or N) = 1 - 33/70 = 37/70. \n\nSame result. So that confirms that 37/70 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute P(S or N) by considering all possibilities:\n\n- It rains on Saturday and Sunday: P(S and N) = 6/35 ≈ 0.1714\n\n- It rains on Saturday but not Sunday: P(S and not N) = P(S) - P(S and N) = 0.4 - 6/35. Let me compute 0.4 is 14/35, so 14/35 - 6/35 = 8/35 ≈ 0.2286\n\n- It does not rain on Saturday but rains on Sunday: P(not S and N) = P(N) - P(S and N) = 0.3 - 6/35. 0.3 is 21/70, which is 10.5/35? Wait, maybe better to convert 6/35 to 12/70. 0.3 is 21/70, so 21/70 - 12/70 = 9/70 ≈ 0.1286. Alternatively, in 35 denominator: 0.3 is 3/10, which is 10.5/35? Wait, maybe not. Let me do fractions:\n\nP(not S and N) = P(N | not S) * P(not S) = (3/14) * (3/5) = 9/70. Which is ≈ 0.1286. \n\n- It does not rain on either day: P(not S and not N) = 33/70 as above. \n\nSo total P(S or N) is the sum of the first three probabilities: 6/35 + 8/35 + 9/70. Let me convert them to 70 denominator:\n\n6/35 = 12/70\n\n8/35 = 16/70\n\n9/70 = 9/70\n\nAdding them: 12 + 16 + 9 = 37, over 70. So again, 37/70. \n\nSo all methods lead to 37/70, so that must be correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 37 + 70 = 107. \n\nBut just to recap the steps, because sometimes when problems are multi-step, it's easy to have made an error in the beginning. \n\nOriginal problem: Given P(S) = 0.4, P(N) = 0.3, and P(N | S) = 2 * P(N | not S). \n\nWe used the law of total probability to find P(N | S) and P(N | not S). Then, we calculated P(S and N) to use in the formula for P(S or N). \n\nAlternatively, we could have thought about it as solving for the conditional probabilities first. \n\nLet me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and maybe get confused. \n\nSuppose someone thought that P(N) is 0.3 regardless of dependence, but the problem says there is dependence between Saturday and Sunday. So if you ignore the conditional probability part, you might incorrectly assume independence and compute P(S or N) as 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.4*0.3 = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.12 = 0.58, which is 29/50, but that's wrong because the events are not independent. The correct answer here is 37/70 ≈ 0.5286, which is different. \n\nSo the key was recognizing that we need to use the conditional probability given in the problem to find the joint probability P(S and N), which isn't simply the product of the two probabilities. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 37/70, so a + b = 107. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{107}\n</think>"}
