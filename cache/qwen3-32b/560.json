The sides are given as AB=21, AC=22, and BC=20. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Let me start by recalling some concepts.\n\nFirst, since DE is parallel to BC, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem). That means the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. So if I can find the ratio of similarity between triangle ADE and ABC, I can find DE.\n\nBut DE also passes through the incenter of triangle ABC. So I need to figure out where the incenter is located in relation to the sides AB and AC, and then determine the ratio of similarity such that DE passes through that incenter.\n\nLet me recall that the incenter is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. The coordinates of the incenter can be found using the formula that weights the vertices by the lengths of the sides. Alternatively, maybe I can find the distances from the incenter to the sides?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me try setting up coordinates for triangle ABC. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (21, 0). Wait, but then AC is 22 and BC is 20. Hmm, maybe coordinate geometry would work here. Let me try that approach.\n\nBut before that, maybe there's a way without coordinates. Let me think about the ratios. Since DE is parallel to BC, the ratio of DE to BC is equal to the ratio of AD to AB (or AE to AC). Let me denote the ratio as k, so DE = k * BC = 20k. Therefore, if I can find k, I can find DE.\n\nNow, the key is that DE passes through the incenter. So I need to find k such that the incenter lies on DE. Let me recall that the inradius can be calculated, and the coordinates of the incenter. Alternatively, maybe I can find the distances from A to D and A to E?\n\nAlternatively, since DE is parallel to BC, the distance between DE and BC will be proportional. Wait, but maybe I need to find where the incenter is located along the altitude or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use mass point geometry? Or perhaps coordinate geometry is the way to go here.\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let me set coordinates:\n\nLet me place point A at (0, 0). Let me place point B at (21, 0). Now, point C is somewhere in the plane. Given that AC = 22 and BC = 20. Let me find coordinates for point C.\n\nLet me denote coordinates for C as (x, y). Then, distance from A to C is √(x² + y²) = 22, so x² + y² = 22² = 484. The distance from B to C is √((x - 21)² + y²) = 20, so (x - 21)² + y² = 400. Subtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 21)² + y² - x² - y² = 400 - 484 => (x² - 42x + 441) - x² = -84 => -42x + 441 = -84 => -42x = -525 => x = 525 / 42 = 12.5. So x = 25/2 = 12.5. Then, plugging back into x² + y² = 484:\n\n(25/2)² + y² = 484 => 625/4 + y² = 484 => y² = 484 - 625/4. Let me convert 484 to fourths: 484 = 1936/4. So y² = (1936 - 625)/4 = 1311/4. Therefore, y = √(1311)/2. Let me check if 1311 is correct. Let me compute 484 * 4 = 1936? Wait, 484 is 22². 22*22=484. Then 22² * 4 is 1936? Wait, no. Wait, 484 * 4 is indeed 1936. Then subtract 625? 1936 - 625 is 1311. Yes. So y = sqrt(1311)/2. Hmm, okay. Maybe I don't need to compute the exact value, but maybe I need coordinates for the incenter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me recall that the coordinates of the incenter can be found using the formula:\n\nIf the triangle has vertices at (x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B), (x_C, y_C), and sides opposite to these vertices have lengths a, b, c respectively, then the incenter (I_x, I_y) is given by:\n\nI_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c),\n\nI_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c).\n\nWait, actually, I think it's weighted by the lengths of the sides. Let me confirm. The incenter coordinates are given by ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c), same for y). Wait, no, actually, it's weighted by the lengths opposite the respective vertices. Wait, actually, the formula is:\n\nIf the side lengths opposite to A, B, C are a, b, c respectively, then incenter is ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ) / (a + b + c ), same for y).\n\nWait, but in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. Wait, let me check.\n\nStandard notation: In triangle ABC, a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. Then, the incenter coordinates are ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ) / (a + b + c ), ... )\n\nWait, no, actually, it's weighted by the lengths of the sides adjacent to the vertices. Wait, no, I think it's weighted by the lengths of the sides opposite the respective vertices. Let me check with a reference.\n\nWait, actually, according to formula, the incenter can be calculated as:\n\nI_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c),\n\nwhere a, b, c are lengths of sides opposite to A, B, C. Wait, but in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.\n\nWait, let me check with coordinates. Suppose we have triangle with coordinates A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1). Then sides: a = BC = √2, b = AC = 1, c = AB = 1. Then incenter should be at (r, r), where r is inradius. Let me compute via formula:\n\nI_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c) = (√2 * 0 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 0)/(√2 + 1 + 1) = 1/(2 + √2). Similarly, I_y = (√2 * 0 + 1 * 0 + 1 * 1)/(same denominator) = 1/(2 + √2). So coordinates (1/(2 + √2), 1/(2 + √2)), which simplifies to (√2 - 1)/ ( (2 + √2)(√2 - 1) )? Wait, maybe not necessary. The key point is that the formula uses the lengths opposite the respective vertices. So in our case, for triangle ABC, with AB=21, AC=22, BC=20. So let me define:\n\nStandard notation: Let me denote a = BC = 20, b = AC = 22, c = AB = 21. Then, the incenter coordinates would be:\n\nI_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c),\n\nI_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c).\n\nBut in our coordinate system, A is (0, 0), B is (21, 0), and C is (12.5, sqrt(1311)/2). Therefore, plugging into the formula:\n\nI_x = [a x_A + b x_B + c x_C]/(a + b + c) = [20*0 + 22*21 + 21*12.5]/(20 + 22 + 21).\n\nSimilarly, I_y = [20*0 + 22*0 + 21*(sqrt(1311)/2)]/(63).\n\nLet me compute I_x first. Let me compute numerator:\n\n22*21 = 462,\n\n21*12.5 = 21*(25/2) = 525/2 = 262.5,\n\nSo total numerator: 462 + 262.5 = 724.5. Denominator is 20 + 22 + 21 = 63. Therefore, I_x = 724.5 / 63. Let me compute that. 724.5 divided by 63. Let me note that 63 * 11 = 693. 724.5 - 693 = 31.5. 31.5 / 63 = 0.5. Therefore, total is 11.5. Therefore, I_x = 11.5 = 23/2.\n\nWait, that's nice! So the x-coordinate of the incenter is 23/2. Let me check my calculation again:\n\n22*21: 22*20=440, plus 22*1=22, so 462. Correct.\n\n21*12.5: 12.5*20=250, 12.5*1=12.5, total 262.5. Correct.\n\nTotal numerator: 462 + 262.5 = 724.5. Divided by 63. 63*11=693, 724.5-693=31.5, 31.5/63=0.5, so total 11.5. Correct. So I_x is 23/2. Okay. Now for I_y:\n\n[20*0 + 22*0 + 21*(sqrt(1311)/2)] / 63 = [21*(sqrt(1311)/2)] / 63 = [sqrt(1311)/2]/3 = sqrt(1311)/6. So I_y = sqrt(1311)/6. Okay, so the incenter is at (23/2, sqrt(1311)/6). \n\nNow, DE is a line segment parallel to BC passing through the incenter. Since DE is parallel to BC, and D is on AB, E is on AC. Let me find the equation of DE. Since it's parallel to BC, it has the same slope as BC. Let me compute the slope of BC. Coordinates of B(21, 0) and C(12.5, sqrt(1311)/2). The slope is [ (sqrt(1311)/2 - 0) / (12.5 - 21) ] = [sqrt(1311)/2] / (-8.5) = -sqrt(1311)/17. Therefore, the slope of DE is -sqrt(1311)/17.\n\nNow, DE passes through the incenter (23/2, sqrt(1311)/6). Therefore, the equation of DE is:\n\ny - sqrt(1311)/6 = [-sqrt(1311)/17] (x - 23/2).\n\nNow, I need to find where this line intersects AB and AC to find points D and E. Let me first find point D on AB. AB is the line from A(0,0) to B(21, 0), which is the x-axis. Therefore, AB is y = 0. So to find D, set y = 0 in the equation of DE:\n\n0 - sqrt(1311)/6 = [-sqrt(1311)/17] (x - 23/2).\n\nMultiply both sides by 17 to eliminate denominators:\n\n- [sqrt(1311)/6 * 17] = -sqrt(1311) (x - 23/2).\n\nDivide both sides by -sqrt(1311):\n\n(1/6 * 17) = (x - 23/2)\n\nSo 17/6 = x - 23/2 => x = 23/2 + 17/6 = (69 + 17)/6 = 86/6 = 43/3 ≈ 14.333...\n\nWait, but AB is from x=0 to x=21. 43/3 is approximately 14.333, which is between 0 and 21, so that's okay. Therefore, point D is at (43/3, 0).\n\nNow, let me check if this is correct. Let me verify:\n\nStarting from equation:\n\ny - sqrt(1311)/6 = [-sqrt(1311)/17] (x - 23/2)\n\nSet y = 0:\n\n- sqrt(1311)/6 = [-sqrt(1311)/17] (x - 23/2)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nsqrt(1311)/6 = [sqrt(1311)/17] (x - 23/2)\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(1311):\n\n1/6 = (1/17)(x - 23/2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 17:\n\n17/6 = x - 23/2 => x = 17/6 + 23/2 = 17/6 + 69/6 = 86/6 = 43/3. Yes, correct. So D is at (43/3, 0). \n\nNow, let me find point E on AC. AC is from A(0, 0) to C(12.5, sqrt(1311)/2). Let me parametrize AC. Let me find the parametric equations or find the equation of line AC. Alternatively, since DE is parallel to BC and passes through E on AC, perhaps we can use the ratio?\n\nBut since we have coordinates, maybe we can find the intersection of DE with AC.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of AC. Points A(0,0) and C(12.5, sqrt(1311)/2). The slope of AC is [ (sqrt(1311)/2 - 0) / (12.5 - 0) ] = [sqrt(1311)/2] / 12.5 = sqrt(1311)/25. Therefore, equation of AC is y = [sqrt(1311)/25] x.\n\nNow, equation of DE is y - sqrt(1311)/6 = [-sqrt(1311)/17] (x - 23/2). Let me solve for intersection with AC. So substitute y = [sqrt(1311)/25] x into DE's equation:\n\n[sqrt(1311)/25] x - sqrt(1311)/6 = [-sqrt(1311)/17] (x - 23/2)\n\nLet me divide both sides by sqrt(1311) to simplify:\n\n( x / 25 - 1/6 ) = - (1/17)(x - 23/2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 17*25*6 to eliminate denominators. Let me compute LCM of 25, 6, 17. Since they are all prime factors: 25=5², 6=2*3, 17 is prime. So LCM is 2*3*5²*17 = 2*3*25*17 = 6*25*17 = 150*17 = 2550. Let me multiply both sides by 2550:\n\n2550*(x/25 - 1/6) = 2550*(-1/17)(x - 23/2)\n\nCompute left side:\n\n2550*(x/25) - 2550*(1/6) = 102x - 425\n\nRight side:\n\n2550*(-1/17)*(x - 23/2) = -150*(x - 23/2) = -150x + 150*(23/2) = -150x + (3450/2) = -150x + 1725\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n102x - 425 = -150x + 1725\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n102x - 425 + 150x - 1725 = 0 => 252x - 2150 = 0 => 252x = 2150 => x = 2150 / 252.\n\nSimplify this fraction. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 2: 1075 / 126. Let me check if 1075 and 126 have common factors. 126 factors: 2*3²*7. 1075 divided by 5 is 215. 215 divided by 5 is 43. So 1075 = 5²*43. 126 is 2*3²*7. No common factors. Therefore, x = 1075/126. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me check the equation again:\n\nOriginal equation after dividing by sqrt(1311):\n\nx/25 - 1/6 = - (1/17)(x - 23/2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2550:\n\nLeft side: 2550*(x/25 - 1/6) = 102x - 425. Correct because 2550 /25 = 102, 2550 /6 = 425.\n\nRight side: -2550/17*(x - 23/2) = -150*(x - 23/2). Correct because 2550 /17 = 150.\n\nThen expanding:\n\n-150x + 150*(23/2) = -150x + (150/2)*23 = -150x + 75*23 = -150x + 1725. Correct.\n\nThen 102x - 425 = -150x + 1725 => 102x + 150x = 1725 + 425 => 252x = 2150 => x = 2150 / 252. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 1075 / 126. Yes, as above. So x = 1075/126. Let me check decimal value to see if it makes sense. 126*8 = 1008, 1075 - 1008 = 67, so 8 + 67/126 ≈ 8.53... But AC is from x=0 to x=12.5 (which is 25/2 = 12.5). 8.53 is between 0 and 12.5, so okay. Therefore, point E is at x = 1075/126, and y = [sqrt(1311)/25] * x. \n\nNow, having found coordinates of D(43/3, 0) and E(1075/126, [sqrt(1311)/25]*(1075/126)), we can compute DE's length. However, since DE is parallel to BC, and triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC, we can find the ratio of similarity and then compute DE = k * BC. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe compute DE's length directly. However, since BC is 20, and DE is parallel, perhaps the ratio is easier.\n\nBut since we have coordinates, maybe we can compute the ratio. Let me see. Let me compute AD and AB. AB is 21. AD is the distance from A(0,0) to D(43/3, 0), which is 43/3. Therefore, the ratio k is AD / AB = (43/3)/21 = 43/(3*21) = 43/63. Therefore, DE = k * BC = (43/63)*20 = 860/63. Let me check if that reduces. 860 divided by 63. 63*13=819, 860-819=41. So 860/63 = 13 + 41/63. 41 and 63 are coprime? 41 is prime, 63 is 7*9. Yes. So 860/63. Therefore, m=860, n=63. Check if they are coprime. GCD(860,63). 63 divides into 860 how many times? 63*13=819, 860-819=41. Then GCD(63,41). 63 ÷ 41 = 1 with remainder 22. GCD(41,22). 41 ÷ 22 = 1 r19; GCD(22,19); 22 ÷ 19=1 r3; GCD(19,3); 19 ÷ 3=6 r1; GCD(3,1)=1. Therefore, GCD(860,63)=1? Wait, no. Wait, GCD(860,63). Since 860 = 63*13 + 41, then GCD(860,63) = GCD(63,41). Which we saw is 1. Therefore, 860/63 is reduced. Therefore, DE = 860/63, so m + n = 860 + 63 = 923. \n\nBut let me confirm this result by another method to be sure. Because I might have made a mistake in assuming the ratio k is AD / AB. Wait, since DE is parallel to BC, by similar triangles, yes, the ratio should be AD / AB = AE / AC = DE / BC. Therefore, if AD / AB is 43/3 divided by 21 = 43/63, then DE is 20*(43/63)=860/63. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with coordinates. Let me compute DE's length. Coordinates of D(43/3, 0) and E(1075/126, y_E). Let me compute the difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates.\n\nFirst, compute x_E - x_D = 1075/126 - 43/3. Convert 43/3 to 43*42/126 = 1806/126. Wait, 43/3 = (43*42)/ (3*42) )= (43*14)/42? Wait, no, better to convert 43/3 to denominator 126: 43/3 = (43 * 42)/126. Because 3*42=126. So 43 * 42 = let me compute 40*42 + 3*42 = 1680 + 126 = 1806. Therefore, x_D = 43/3 = 1806/126. Therefore, x_E - x_D = 1075/126 - 1806/126 = (1075 - 1806)/126 = (-731)/126. \n\nSimilarly, y_E - y_D. y_D is 0, so it's just y_E. y_E = [sqrt(1311)/25] * x_E = [sqrt(1311)/25] * (1075/126). Let me compute that. 1075 / 25 = 43. So y_E = sqrt(1311) * 43 / 126. Therefore, the difference in y-coordinates is sqrt(1311)*43 / 126.\n\nTherefore, DE's length is sqrt[ ( (-731/126)^2 + (sqrt(1311)*43 / 126)^2 ) ].\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nsqrt[ (731² + 1311 * 43² ) / 126² ] = [ sqrt(731² + 1311 * 43² ) ] / 126.\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\nFirst, compute 731². Let me note that 700² = 490000, 31²=961, and 2*700*31=43400. Therefore, 731² = (700 + 31)^2 = 700² + 2*700*31 + 31² = 490000 + 43400 + 961 = 490000 + 43400 = 533400 + 961 = 534,361.\n\nNow compute 1311 * 43². First compute 43² = 1849. Then 1311 * 1849. Let me compute this. Hmm, this seems tedious. Let me see if there is a relationship between 731 and 43?\n\nWait, note that earlier, we had the ratio k = 43/63. If DE is 20*(43/63) = 860/63, then the length squared would be (860/63)^2. Let me check if the numerator squared equals that.\n\nAlternatively, since DE is parallel to BC, and BC has length 20, then DE should be k*20. Therefore, if my previous calculation is correct, DE should be 860/63 ≈ 13.65. Let me check if the numerator sqrt(...) equals 860/63 * 126 = 860 * 2 = 1720. Therefore, sqrt(731² + 1311 * 43² ) should be 1720. Let me check if 731² + 1311 * 43² = 1720².\n\nCompute 1720²: 1720² = (1700 + 20)^2 = 1700² + 2*1700*20 + 20² = 2,890,000 + 68,000 + 400 = 2,958,400.\n\nNow compute 731² + 1311 * 43²:\n\nWe already have 731² = 534,361.\n\nNow compute 1311 * 43² = 1311 * 1849.\n\nLet me compute 1311 * 1849. Let me note that 1311 is 1300 + 11. So:\n\n1300 * 1849 + 11 * 1849.\n\nFirst compute 1300 * 1849:\n\nWell, 1000 * 1849 = 1,849,000\n\n300 * 1849 = 554,700\n\nTherefore, 1300 * 1849 = 1,849,000 + 554,700 = 2,403,700\n\nNow compute 11 * 1849:\n\n10*1849 = 18,490\n\n1*1849 = 1,849\n\nTotal: 18,490 + 1,849 = 20,339\n\nTherefore, total 1311 * 1849 = 2,403,700 + 20,339 = 2,424,039.\n\nThen, adding 731² which is 534,361:\n\nTotal numerator squared: 2,424,039 + 534,361 = 2,958,400. Which is equal to 1720². Therefore, sqrt(2,958,400) = 1720. Therefore, DE length is 1720 / 126 = 860 / 63. Which confirms our previous result. Therefore, DE = 860/63. Therefore, m = 860, n = 63. Are they coprime?\n\nAs checked before, GCD(860, 63). Prime factors of 63: 3² * 7. 860 divided by 2 is 430, divided by 2 is 215, which is 5*43. Therefore, prime factors of 860: 2² * 5 * 43. 63 is 3² * 7. No common factors. Therefore, 860/63 is reduced, so m + n = 860 + 63 = 923.\n\nBut let me check once more if there's another way to get this ratio without coordinates. Maybe using the formula for the inradius and the distance from A to the incenter?\n\nLet me recall that in a triangle, the inradius r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nFirst, compute semiperimeter s = (21 + 22 + 20)/2 = (63)/2 = 31.5.\n\nCompute area using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)] = sqrt[31.5*(31.5 - 21)(31.5 - 22)(31.5 - 20)] = sqrt[31.5*(10.5)(9.5)(11.5)]. Let me compute this. But maybe I can compute the area another way. Alternatively, since I already have coordinates for the triangle, maybe compute area as base * height / 2.\n\nEarlier, coordinates of A(0,0), B(21,0), C(12.5, sqrt(1311)/2). The base AB is 21, height is the y-coordinate of C, which is sqrt(1311)/2. Therefore, area is (21 * sqrt(1311)/2)/2 = (21 sqrt(1311))/4. Alternatively, using Heron's formula:\n\nCompute s = 63/2, s - AB = 63/2 - 21 = 63/2 - 42/2 = 21/2, s - AC = 63/2 - 22 = 63/2 - 44/2 = 19/2, s - BC = 63/2 - 20 = 63/2 - 40/2 = 23/2. Therefore, area squared is 63/2 * 21/2 * 19/2 * 23/2. Let me compute that:\n\n(63 * 21 * 19 * 23) / 16. Let me compute numerator:\n\nFirst compute 63 * 21 = 1323, then 19 * 23 = 437. Then multiply 1323 * 437. This seems complicated, but since we already have the area as (21 sqrt(1311))/4, squaring it gives (441 * 1311)/16. Therefore, equate:\n\n(63 * 21 * 19 * 23)/16 = (441 * 1311)/16. Therefore, 63*21*19*23 = 441*1311. Let me check 441 is 21². Therefore, 21² * 1311. On the left side, 63*21 = 21*3*21 = 21² * 3. Therefore, left side is 21² * 3 * 19 * 23. Therefore, 21² * 3 * 19 * 23 vs 21² * 1311. Therefore, 3*19*23 should be 1311. Let me compute 3*19=57, 57*23. 57*20=1140, 57*3=171, total 1140 + 171 = 1311. Yes, correct. Therefore, Heron's formula gives same area. Therefore, area is (21 sqrt(1311))/4. Therefore, inradius r = area / s = [ (21 sqrt(1311))/4 ] / (63/2) ) = [21 sqrt(1311)/4] * [2/63] = [42 / 252] sqrt(1311) = [1/6] sqrt(1311). Which matches our previous calculation of I_y = sqrt(1311)/6. Since incenter coordinates were (23/2, sqrt(1311)/6). Therefore, the y-coordinate of the incenter is the inradius? Wait, no, in general, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but in this coordinate system, since AB is on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the incenter is indeed the distance from the incenter to AB, which is the inradius. Therefore, r = sqrt(1311)/6. \n\nNow, since DE is parallel to BC and passes through the incenter. Let me think in terms of distances. The distance between AB and DE would be r, since the inradius is the distance from the incenter to AB. Wait, no, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to all sides. But DE is parallel to BC, so the distance between DE and BC would be something? Wait, maybe not directly helpful. Alternatively, since DE is parallel to BC, the ratio of distances from A would be the same as the ratio of similarity. Let me denote that.\n\nLet me denote that the distance from A to DE is k times the distance from A to BC. Since DE is parallel to BC, then the ratio of similarity k is equal to (distance from A to DE) / (distance from A to BC). The distance from A to BC is the height of the triangle, which we already have as sqrt(1311)/2 (since area is (base BC * height)/2 = (20 * h)/2 = 10h, and area is also (21 sqrt(1311))/4. Therefore, 10h = 21 sqrt(1311)/4 => h = 21 sqrt(1311)/40. Wait, earlier I thought the height was sqrt(1311)/2, but that was the y-coordinate of point C. Wait, actually, the height from A to BC is different. Wait, no, in our coordinate system, AB is the base on x-axis, and C is at (12.5, sqrt(1311)/2). Therefore, the height from C to AB is indeed sqrt(1311)/2, which would be the height of the triangle with base AB. However, if we consider BC as the base, then the height from A to BC is different. Let me clarify.\n\nBut since DE is parallel to BC, the ratio k can be found by the ratio of distances from A. Let me denote H as the distance from A to BC, and h as the distance from A to DE. Then k = h / H. However, since DE passes through the incenter, which is at distance r from AB. Wait, but the incenter is at distance r from AB, BC, and AC. However, the distance from A to DE is not directly r. Wait, perhaps I need to find the distance from A to DE and the distance from A to BC?\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe not necessary. But perhaps another approach. Let me think. Since we know the ratio k = AD / AB = 43/63, as found earlier, and DE = k * BC = 860/63. Therefore, maybe that's sufficient. However, let me see if I can derive k using the inradius.\n\nAlternatively, since DE passes through the incenter, which is located at a certain position along the angle bisector. But since DE is parallel to BC, maybe we can use the formula for a line parallel to BC passing through a particular point.\n\nAlternatively, think of mass point or similar triangles. Let me consider the ratio in which the incenter divides the angle bisector. But since DE is parallel to BC, it might divide AB and AC proportionally.\n\nAlternatively, since the incenter is located along DE, which is parallel to BC, then the ratio k can be determined by considering the position of the incenter along the line from A to the incenter. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me denote that the coordinates of the incenter are (23/2, r) where r = sqrt(1311)/6. Also, since DE is parallel to BC, which has slope -sqrt(1311)/17 as calculated earlier, and passes through the incenter. \n\nAlternatively, since we found through coordinates that k = AD / AB = 43/63, and verified that DE = 860/63, which reduces to 860 + 63 = 923. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me recall that in a triangle, if a line is drawn parallel to one side passing through the incenter, then the ratio can be found by some formula?\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the distance from A to DE. Since DE is parallel to BC, and passes through the incenter. The distance from A to DE over the distance from A to BC equals k. Let me compute distance from A to DE. Since A is (0,0), and DE has equation y - sqrt(1311)/6 = [-sqrt(1311)/17] (x - 23/2). The distance from A(0,0) to DE can be calculated using the formula for distance from a point to a line.\n\nThe general formula is |Ax + By + C| / sqrt(A² + B²). Let me rewrite the equation of DE in standard form.\n\nStarting from y - sqrt(1311)/6 = [-sqrt(1311)/17](x - 23/2)\n\nMultiply out:\n\ny = [-sqrt(1311)/17]x + [sqrt(1311)/17 * 23/2] + sqrt(1311)/6\n\nLet me combine the constants:\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(1311)/17 * 23/2] + sqrt(1311)/6 = sqrt(1311) [23/(34) + 1/6] = sqrt(1311) [ (23*6 + 34)/204 ] = sqrt(1311) [ (138 + 34)/204 ] = sqrt(1311) [172 / 204] = sqrt(1311) [43 / 51].\n\nTherefore, equation of DE is y = [-sqrt(1311)/17]x + [43 sqrt(1311)/51]. Therefore, rearranged:\n\n[sqrt(1311)/17]x + y - [43 sqrt(1311)/51] = 0.\n\nTherefore, standard form: [sqrt(1311)/17]x + y - [43 sqrt(1311)/51] = 0. \n\nTherefore, distance from A(0,0) to DE is | [sqrt(1311)/17 * 0 + 1 * 0 - 43 sqrt(1311)/51 ] | / sqrt( (sqrt(1311)/17)^2 + 1^2 )\n\nSimplify numerator: | -43 sqrt(1311)/51 | = 43 sqrt(1311)/51.\n\nDenominator: sqrt( (1311 / 289) + 1 ) = sqrt( (1311 + 289)/289 ) = sqrt(1600 / 289 ) = 40/17.\n\nTherefore, distance from A to DE is [43 sqrt(1311)/51] / [40/17] = [43 sqrt(1311)/51] * [17/40] = [43 sqrt(1311) * 17 ] / [51 * 40]. Simplify 17/51 = 1/3. Therefore, distance is [43 sqrt(1311)/3 ] / 40 = 43 sqrt(1311) / 120.\n\nNow, the distance from A to BC is the height of the triangle with base BC. Wait, earlier we had two different heights: one from A to BC and one from C to AB. Wait, let me compute distance from A to BC. Since BC is the base, let me compute it.\n\nAlternatively, since area is (base BC * height from A)/2. Area is 21 sqrt(1311)/4. Therefore, height from A to BC is (2 * area)/BC = (2 * 21 sqrt(1311)/4)/20 = (21 sqrt(1311)/2)/20 = 21 sqrt(1311)/40. \n\nTherefore, the ratio k is (distance from A to DE) / (distance from A to BC) = [43 sqrt(1311)/120] / [21 sqrt(1311)/40] = (43 / 120) / (21 / 40) = (43 / 120) * (40 / 21) = (43 / 3) * (1 / 21) = 43 / 63. Which matches our previous result! Therefore, DE = k * BC = 43/63 * 20 = 860/63. Therefore, confirming again the same answer. Therefore, m + n = 860 + 63 = 923.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident the answer is 923.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{923}\n</think>"}
