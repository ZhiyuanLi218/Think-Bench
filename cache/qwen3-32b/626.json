So, we have two electrons in a p orbital, which means each has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l₁ and l₂ both equal to 1. We're told to ignore their spin, so we're only considering the orbital angular momentum here. The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩. The question is asking for the joint probability that when we measure L₁z and L₂z, we get both eigenvalues as -ħ. The options are 0, 1, 1/2, or 2/3. \n\nFirst, let me recall some angular momentum coupling concepts. When two angular momenta are coupled, the total angular momentum state |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ is a linear combination of the uncoupled states |l₁, m₁⟩ ⊗ |l₂, m₂⟩. The coefficients in this linear combination are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. So, if I can express |1,1,2,-1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m₁, m₂⟩, then I can find the probability of each (m₁, m₂) pair, including the specific case where m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1.\n\nGiven that each electron is in a p orbital (l=1), their individual m values can be -1, 0, +1. The total angular momentum quantum number l can range from |l₁ - l₂| to l₁ + l₂. Since l₁ = l₂ = 1, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. But in our case, the total l is given as 2. So we are in the case of maximum total angular momentum, l=2. The state |l=2, m=-1⟩ is a combination of different |m₁, m₂⟩ states where m₁ + m₂ = m_total = -1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the state |1,1,2,-1⟩. The general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be complex, but maybe there's a simpler way or a known table for l=1 and l=1 coupling.\n\nAlternatively, I can think recursively or use ladder operators. Let me recall that for coupling two l=1 states to get l=2. The state with maximum m=2 would be |m₁=1, m₂=1⟩. Then, applying the lowering operator to get down to m=-1. But maybe there's a more straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l=2, m⟩ is a combination of |m₁, m₂⟩ such that m₁ + m₂ = m. For m_total = -1, the possible pairs (m₁, m₂) are:\n\n(-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1)? Wait, wait. Let me check. If m₁ + m₂ = -1, then possible combinations for m₁ and m₂ (each can be -1, 0, +1) are:\n\n- m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → sum -1\n\n- m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → sum -1\n\n- m₁ = +1, m₂ = -2 → but m₂ can't be -2 since l=1, so m₂ ranges from -1 to +1. Similarly, m₁ can't be lower than -1. So only the first two combinations. Wait, but if m₁ + m₂ = -1, then the possible pairs are:\n\n(-1, 0), (0, -1), and (1, -2)? No, the last one is invalid. So only two possibilities? Wait, but let me check again. If m₁ can be -1, 0, +1 and same for m₂, then:\n\nFor m_total = -1:\n\nPossible (m₁, m₂):\n\n(-1, 0), (0, -1), and also (1, -2)? No, since m₂ can't be -2. Wait, but what about (-1, 0) and (0, -1) and maybe (-1, -1) would give sum -2, which is not -1. Wait, so only two possibilities? That seems odd. Wait, for example, if m_total is -1, then m₁ + m₂ = -1. Let me list all possible pairs:\n\nIf m₁ = -1, then m₂ must be 0.\n\nIf m₁ = 0, then m₂ must be -1.\n\nIf m₁ = +1, then m₂ must be -2, which is invalid. Similarly, m₁ can't be less than -1. So only two possible combinations: (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Therefore, the state |2, -1⟩ is a combination of | -1, 0 ⟩ and | 0, -1 ⟩. Therefore, there is no component with both m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1 because that would give m_total = -2, which is not our case here. Therefore, if the question is asking for the probability that both L₁z and L₂z are -ħ, which corresponds to m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1, but since m_total would be -2, and our state is |l=2, m=-1⟩, which doesn't have that component, then the probability would be zero?\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify with Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me recall the standard Clebsch-Gordan table for coupling two l=1 states to get l=2.\n\nThe state |l=2, m=2⟩ is |1,1⟩ ⊗ |1,1⟩.\n\nThe state |l=2, m=1⟩ is a combination of |1,0⟩⊗|1,1⟩ and |1,1⟩⊗|1,0⟩.\n\nSimilarly, |l=2, m=0⟩ would be combination of |1,-1⟩⊗|1,1⟩, |1,0⟩⊗|1,0⟩, and |1,1⟩⊗|1,-1⟩.\n\nFor m=-1, the state |l=2, m=-1⟩ should be a combination of |1,-1⟩⊗|1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩⊗|1,-1⟩. And for m=-2, it would be |1,-1⟩⊗|1,-1⟩.\n\nTherefore, if that's the case, then |2,-1⟩ is a combination of | -1, 0 ⟩ and | 0, -1 ⟩. Therefore, there is no component with both m₁=-1 and m₂=-1. Therefore, the amplitude for (m₁=-1, m₂=-1) is zero, so the probability is zero. Therefore, the answer is A: 0?\n\nBut let me check the coefficients to be sure. Let me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get l=2.\n\nThe general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be found in tables or derived using recursion relations. For example, the state |l=2, m⟩ can be written as:\n\nFor m=2: |2,2⟩ = |1,1⟩|1,1⟩\n\nFor m=1: |2,1⟩ = √(1/2)( |1,1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,1⟩ )\n\nFor m=0: |2,0⟩ = √(1/6)( |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩ + |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩ ) + √(2/3)|1,0⟩|1,0⟩\n\nFor m=-1: |2,-1⟩ = √(1/2)( |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ )\n\nFor m=-2: |2,-2⟩ = |1,-1⟩|1,-1⟩\n\nSo yes, the state |2,-1⟩ is √(1/2)( | -1, 0 ⟩ + | 0, -1 ⟩ ). Therefore, the expansion of |2,-1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled basis has only two terms: |m₁=-1, m₂=0⟩ and |m₁=0, m₂=-1⟩, each with coefficient √(1/2). Therefore, the probability of each term is |√(1/2)|² = 1/2. But since there are two terms, each contributes 1/2? Wait, no. The total probability is the sum of the squares of the coefficients. Wait, if the state is a normalized combination, then the coefficients squared give the probabilities. Here, the state is ( | -1, 0 ⟩ + | 0, -1 ⟩ ) / √2. Therefore, each term has coefficient 1/√2, so the probability for | -1, 0 ⟩ is 1/2, and same for |0, -1⟩. Therefore, the total probability for getting m₁=-1 and m₂=0 is 1/2, and same for m₁=0 and m₂=-1. Therefore, the probability of getting both m₁=-1 and m₂=-1 is zero, since that term isn't present. Therefore, the answer should be A: 0.\n\nBut let me check again. Suppose we have two electrons. The total state is |2,-1⟩. When we measure L₁z and L₂z, the possible outcomes are the pairs (m₁, m₂) that contribute to this state. As per the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, only (-1,0) and (0,-1) contribute. Therefore, getting both -1 and -1 is not possible. Therefore, the probability is zero. Hence, the answer is A.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's another approach. Let me consider that the state |l=2, m=-1⟩ is symmetric under exchange of the two particles? Since electrons are identical particles, but the problem says to ignore spin. Wait, but electrons are fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. However, the problem says to ignore spin angular momentum. So perhaps we are considering only the spatial part? In that case, if we are ignoring spin, then the spatial wavefunction can be symmetric or antisymmetric depending on the context. However, since the problem is giving us a coupled angular momentum state |l1, l2, l, m⟩, which is a symmetric state? Because when you couple two l=1 states to l=2, the state is symmetric under exchange of the two particles. For example, the state |2, m⟩ is symmetric. Whereas the states coupled to l=0 and l=1 would have different symmetry. But since we are in l=2, which is symmetric, the spatial wavefunction is symmetric. However, since electrons are fermions, if their spin is ignored, does that matter? Wait, the problem says to ignore their spin angular momentum. So perhaps we are treating them as distinguishable particles? Or as indistinct but only considering spatial part? Hmm. However, the question is about the probability of measuring L₁z and L₂z. The operators L₁z and L₂z are associated with each particle's angular momentum. If the particles are indistinct, but we are measuring each one's component, does that affect the probabilities? Hmm. But since the problem gives us a state |l1, l2, l, m⟩, which is a coupled state, and asks for the probability in terms of the individual m₁ and m₂, I think the Clebsch-Gordan approach still holds, regardless of the symmetry, because we are decomposing the state into the product basis. The symmetry would come into play if we had to consider exchange effects or if there were constraints due to the Pauli exclusion principle. However, since we are ignoring spin, and the problem is purely about orbital angular momentum, perhaps the Pauli principle is not enforced here. Wait, but electrons are fermions, so even if we ignore spin, the total wavefunction (which would be spatial times spin) must be antisymmetric. However, since we are told to ignore spin, perhaps the problem is assuming that we are in a situation where the spin part is not considered, so maybe we are allowed to have symmetric spatial wavefunctions? Or maybe the problem is treating the electrons as distinguishable for the sake of the problem? Because otherwise, if you have two electrons in the same spatial state, that would violate the Pauli exclusion principle if their spins are the same. But since we are told to ignore spin, maybe we are to assume that their spins are different? But the problem doesn't mention spin at all, so maybe we can just treat them as distinguishable particles for the purpose of angular momentum coupling. In any case, the given state is |2,-1⟩, which is a valid coupled state regardless of the symmetry, and the question is about the decomposition into m₁ and m₂. So regardless of whether the particles are distinguishable or not, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients give the decomposition. Therefore, the answer remains zero. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about possible mistakes here. Suppose someone might think that since the total m is -1, and each electron can contribute, maybe there's a way to have both m₁ and m₂ as -1? But m₁ + m₂ must equal m_total. If m_total is -1, then m₁ + m₂ = -1. If both m₁ and m₂ are -1, then their sum is -2, which is not equal to -1. Therefore, that combination is impossible. Therefore, the probability is zero. Therefore, answer A: 0.\n\nSo I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
