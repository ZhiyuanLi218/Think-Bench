The problem says that for each integer k between 1 and 100 inclusive, the number x_k is k less than the sum of the other 99 numbers. And then I need to find x₅₀ expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and give m + n. Alright, let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, let me try to translate the given condition into equations. For each k from 1 to 100, x_k is equal to the sum of all the other numbers minus k. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, for each k:\n\nx_k = (Sum of all x_i from i=1 to 100) - x_k - k\n\nWait, hold on. The problem says \"x_k is k less than the sum of the other 99 numbers.\" So that would mean:\n\nx_k = (sum of the other 99 numbers) - k\n\nBut the sum of the other 99 numbers is equal to the total sum S minus x_k. So:\n\nx_k = (S - x_k) - k\n\nWhere S is the total sum of all numbers from x₁ to x₁₀₀. Let me write that equation:\n\nx_k = S - x_k - k\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for S in terms of x_k and k. Let me add x_k to both sides:\n\n2x_k = S - k\n\nTherefore:\n\nS = 2x_k + k\n\nSo for each k, the total sum S is equal to 2x_k + k. Interesting. That seems like a key equation here.\n\nBut since S is the same regardless of which k we choose, we can set up equations for different k's and find relations between the x_k's. Let me think.\n\nFor example, take two different values, say k and m. Then:\n\nS = 2x_k + k\n\nand\n\nS = 2x_m + m\n\nTherefore, 2x_k + k = 2x_m + m\n\nWhich implies that 2(x_k - x_m) = m - k\n\nTherefore, x_k - x_m = (m - k)/2\n\nWhich implies that x_k = x_m + (m - k)/2\n\nSo this suggests that the difference between any two terms x_k and x_m is (m - k)/2. Therefore, the sequence is an arithmetic sequence? Wait, let me check.\n\nIf I fix m, say m is a particular index, then for any other index k, x_k = x_m + (m - k)/2. Let me rearrange that:\n\nx_k = (-1/2)k + (x_m + m/2)\n\nWhich is a linear function in k. Therefore, the entire sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each term is linear in its index. Therefore, the general term is x_k = a*k + b for some constants a and b? Wait, but according to the above, it's x_k = (-1/2)k + c, where c is a constant. Let me check.\n\nSuppose we take m as a fixed index, then c would be x_m + m/2. So if I denote c as a constant for the entire sequence, then x_k = (-1/2)k + c. Therefore, all terms are linear in k with slope -1/2. Therefore, if I can find c, then I can find all x_k, including x_50. Then, once I have x_50, I need to check if it's in reduced terms and compute m + n.\n\nBut how do I find c? Well, we can use the earlier relation S = 2x_k + k. Since S is the sum of all x_i from i=1 to 100. If x_i is (-1/2)i + c, then S would be the sum_{i=1}^{100} [ (-1/2)i + c ].\n\nLet me compute that. Let's compute S:\n\nS = sum_{i=1}^{100} [ (-1/2)i + c ] = (-1/2) * sum_{i=1}^{100} i + c * sum_{i=1}^{100} 1\n\nWe know that sum_{i=1}^n i = n(n + 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 100, that's 100*101/2 = 5050. Therefore:\n\nS = (-1/2)(5050) + c * 100 = -2525 + 100c\n\nBut also, from the earlier equation S = 2x_k + k for any k. Let me pick a specific k. Let me pick k = 1. Then S = 2x₁ + 1. But x₁, according to our formula, is (-1/2)(1) + c = -1/2 + c. Therefore:\n\nS = 2*(-1/2 + c) + 1 = -1 + 2c + 1 = 2c\n\nTherefore, S = 2c. But we also have S = -2525 + 100c. Therefore:\n\n2c = -2525 + 100c\n\nSolving for c:\n\n2c - 100c = -2525\n\n-98c = -2525\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n98c = 2525\n\nTherefore, c = 2525 / 98\n\nLet me check if this reduces. Let me compute GCD of 2525 and 98.\n\nDivide 2525 by 98. 98*25 = 2450. 2525 - 2450 = 75. So GCD(98,75). 98 divided by 75 is 1 with remainder 23. GCD(75,23). 75 divided by 23 is 3 with remainder 6. GCD(23,6). 23 divided by 6 is 3 with remainder 5. GCD(6,5). GCD(5,1). GCD is 1. Therefore, 2525/98 is reduced? Wait, 2525 divided by 5 is 505, 98 divided by 5 is not integer. Wait, 2525 is 25*101? Let me check 25*100 is 2500, so 25*101 = 2525. Yes. And 98 is 49*2. So 2525 and 98 share no common factors? Since 101 is prime, 25 is 5², and 98 is 2*7². Therefore, yes, GCD(2525,98)=1? Wait, no, 2525 is 5²*101, 98 is 2*7². No common factors. Therefore, c = 2525/98. Therefore, x_k = (-1/2)k + 2525/98.\n\nBut we need to compute x_50. Let me compute x_50:\n\nx_50 = (-1/2)(50) + 2525/98 = -25 + 2525/98\n\nLet me convert -25 to 98 denominator:\n\n-25 = -25 * 98 / 98 = -2450 / 98\n\nTherefore, x_50 = (-2450 + 2525)/98 = (75)/98\n\nWait, 2525 - 2450 is 75? Let me check 2525 - 2450. 2525 - 2450 = 75. Yes. Therefore, x_50 = 75/98.\n\nNow check if 75 and 98 are coprime. 75 factors into 3*5², 98 factors into 2*7². No common factors, so yes, 75/98 is reduced. Therefore, m = 75, n = 98, so m + n is 75 + 98 = 173.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the key equation was x_k = S - x_k - k, leading to S = 2x_k + k. Then, using that S is the same for all k, so 2x_k + k = 2x_m + m. Then solving for x_k - x_m = (m - k)/2. Therefore, the sequence is linear in k with slope -1/2. Then, expressing x_k as -k/2 + c. Then computing S as sum_{i=1}^{100} (-i/2 + c) = - (sum i)/2 + 100c = -5050/2 + 100c = -2525 + 100c. Then also, since S = 2x_k + k. Taking k=1, x₁ = -1/2 + c, so S = 2*(-1/2 + c) + 1 = -1 + 2c + 1 = 2c. Therefore, equate to previous expression: 2c = -2525 + 100c => -98c = -2525 => c=2525/98. Then x_50 is -50/2 + 2525/98 = -25 + 2525/98. Converting to 98 denominator: -25*98 is -2450, so total is 75/98. Which reduces to 75/98. So m + n = 75 + 98 = 173. That seems right.\n\nBut let me check with another value of k to see if my value of c is correct. Let me take another k, say k = 100. Then S = 2x_100 + 100. According to our formula, x_100 = -100/2 + c = -50 + c. Therefore, S = 2*(-50 + c) + 100 = -100 + 2c + 100 = 2c. Which is the same as before, so that checks out. Also, if we compute S via the sum, it's -2525 + 100c. And since S = 2c, then 2c = -2525 + 100c, which is how we solved for c. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with k=50. According to our result, x_50 = 75/98. Let's check if S = 2x_50 + 50. Compute 2*(75/98) + 50 = 150/98 + 50 = 75/49 + 50 ≈ 1.53 + 50 ≈ 51.53. But also S is 2c = 2*(2525/98) = 5050/98 = 2525/49 ≈ 51.53. Which is equal to 75/49 + 50? Let me check:\n\n2525 / 49: Let me divide 2525 by 49. 49*50 = 2450. 2525 - 2450 = 75. Therefore, 2525 / 49 = 50 + 75/49. Wait, but that contradicts my previous assertion? Wait, no. Wait, S = 2c = 2*(2525/98) = 2525/49 ≈ 51.53. But 2525 divided by 49 is indeed 50 + 75/49? Wait, 75/49 is 1 + 26/49. Therefore, 50 + 1 + 26/49 = 51 + 26/49 ≈ 51.53. Which is the same as 2x_50 + 50. Since x_50 is 75/98, then 2x_50 is 75/49, so 2x_50 + 50 is 50 + 75/49, which is indeed 2525/49. Therefore, that checks out. So my calculations seem consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. x_50 is 75/98, so m + n = 75 + 98 = 173.\n\nWait, but let me check once more if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me consider the equations for all k. For each k, x_k = S - x_k - k => 2x_k = S - k => x_k = (S - k)/2. Therefore, each term x_k is (S - k)/2. Therefore, the entire sequence is defined in terms of S. Therefore, if we can find S, then we can find all x_k.\n\nTherefore, since x_k = (S - k)/2, then the sum S is sum_{k=1}^{100} x_k = sum_{k=1}^{100} [ (S - k)/2 ] = (1/2) [ 100S - sum_{k=1}^{100} k ] = (1/2)[100S - 5050]\n\nBut S is equal to this sum. Therefore:\n\nS = (1/2)(100S - 5050)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2S = 100S - 5050\n\nThen:\n\n-98S = -5050\n\nTherefore:\n\nS = 5050 / 98\n\nSimplify 5050 / 98. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 2: 2525 / 49. Which is the same as before. Therefore, S = 2525 / 49.\n\nTherefore, x_k = (S - k)/2 = (2525/49 - k)/2. Therefore, for k = 50:\n\nx_50 = (2525/49 - 50)/2. Let me compute 2525/49 - 50. 50 is 2450/49. Therefore, 2525/49 - 2450/49 = 75/49. Then divide by 2: 75/49 / 2 = 75/98. Same result as before. So this alternative approach gives the same answer. Therefore, I think this confirms that 75/98 is correct. Therefore, m + n = 75 + 98 = 173.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 173.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{173}\n</think>"}
