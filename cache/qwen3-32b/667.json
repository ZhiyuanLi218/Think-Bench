The ellipse equation is given as x² + 4y² = 4. One vertex is at (0,1), one altitude is along the y-axis, and I need to find the length of each side, which is expressed as sqrt(m/n), then find m + n. Alright, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the ellipse equation: x² + 4y² = 4. Maybe I should write it in standard form. Dividing both sides by 4 gives (x²)/4 + y² = 1. So, this is an ellipse centered at the origin, with semi-major axis of length 2 along the x-axis and semi-minor axis of length 1 along the y-axis. That makes sense because the standard form is (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1. So here, a² = 4, so a = 2, and b² = 1, so b = 1. So the ellipse is stretched horizontally.\n\nNow, there's an equilateral triangle inscribed in this ellipse. One of the vertices is at (0,1), which is the top of the ellipse since the semi-minor axis is 1. Also, one altitude is contained in the y-axis. Since an altitude is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side, and this altitude is along the y-axis, which is the vertical axis. Given that one vertex is at (0,1), which is on the y-axis, so maybe that vertex is the one with the altitude?\n\nWait, in a triangle, the altitude from a vertex goes to the opposite side. If the altitude is along the y-axis, and the vertex is at (0,1), then the altitude is from (0,1) to the opposite side, which is horizontal? Wait, no, the altitude is perpendicular to the opposite side. If the altitude is along the y-axis, which is vertical, then the opposite side must be horizontal, because the altitude is perpendicular to the side. Therefore, the side opposite the vertex (0,1) is horizontal. Since the altitude is along the y-axis, that altitude would be from (0,1) down to the midpoint of the opposite side? Wait, in an equilateral triangle, all altitudes are also medians and angle bisectors, right? So in an equilateral triangle, the altitude from a vertex goes to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\nTherefore, if the altitude is along the y-axis, then the opposite side is horizontal and its midpoint is on the y-axis. Therefore, the opposite side is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the two other vertices of the triangle are symmetric across the y-axis. Let me denote them as (a, b) and (-a, b), since they are symmetric across the y-axis. Because their midpoint is (0, b), which lies on the y-axis. Since the altitude is along the y-axis, going from (0,1) to (0, b), so the length of the altitude is |1 - b|.\n\nBut since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Let me try to find coordinates of the other two vertices. Let me denote them as (a, b) and (-a, b). So the three vertices are (0,1), (a, b), (-a, b). Now, since the triangle is equilateral, the distance between (0,1) and (a, b) should be equal to the distance between (a, b) and (-a, b), and also equal to the distance between (-a, b) and (0,1). Wait, but since (a, b) and (-a, b) are symmetric, the distance between them is 2a, right? Because the horizontal distance is 2a and vertical distance is 0. So that distance is 2|a|. The distance between (0,1) and (a, b) is sqrt[(a - 0)^2 + (b - 1)^2] = sqrt(a² + (b - 1)^2). Since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so:\n\nsqrt(a² + (b - 1)^2) = 2|a|. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\na² + (b - 1)^2 = 4a².\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b - 1)^2 = 3a².\n\nSo that's one equation.\n\nAdditionally, since the points (a, b) and (-a, b) lie on the ellipse x² + 4y² = 4, so plugging in:\n\nFor (a, b): a² + 4b² = 4.\n\nSimilarly for (-a, b): same equation.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) (b - 1)^2 = 3a²\n\n2) a² + 4b² = 4\n\nSo we can solve these equations for a and b.\n\nLet me express a² from equation 1:\n\nFrom equation 1: a² = [(b - 1)^2]/3\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n[(b - 1)^2]/3 + 4b² = 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n\n(b - 1)^2 + 12b² = 12.\n\nExpand (b - 1)^2:\n\nb² - 2b + 1 + 12b² = 12.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n13b² - 2b + 1 = 12.\n\nSubtract 12:\n\n13b² - 2b - 11 = 0.\n\nSo quadratic equation in b: 13b² - 2b - 11 = 0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation.\n\nDiscriminant D = (-2)^2 - 4*13*(-11) = 4 + 572 = 576.\n\nsqrt(D) = 24.\n\nSolutions:\n\nb = [2 ± 24]/(2*13) = [2 + 24]/26 or [2 - 24]/26.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst solution: 26/26 = 1.\n\nSecond solution: (-22)/26 = -11/13.\n\nSo b = 1 or b = -11/13.\n\nBut if b = 1, then from equation 1: (1 - 1)^2 = 3a² => 0 = 3a² => a = 0. But then the two other vertices would be (0,1) and (0,1), which is the same point as the first vertex, so that can't form a triangle. Therefore, b = -11/13 is the valid solution.\n\nTherefore, b = -11/13.\n\nThen, compute a² from equation 1:\n\na² = [(b - 1)^2]/3 = [(-11/13 - 1)^2]/3 = [(-24/13)^2]/3 = (576/169)/3 = 576/(169*3) = 192/169.\n\nTherefore, a = ±sqrt(192/169) = ±(8*sqrt(3))/13. Wait, sqrt(192) is sqrt(64*3) = 8*sqrt(3). Therefore, a = ±8√3/13.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the other two vertices are (8√3/13, -11/13) and (-8√3/13, -11/13).\n\nNow, we need to confirm that these points lie on the ellipse. Let me check for (8√3/13, -11/13):\n\nx² + 4y² = ( (8√3/13)^2 ) + 4*( (-11/13)^2 ) = (64*3)/169 + 4*(121)/169 = 192/169 + 484/169 = (192 + 484)/169 = 676/169 = 4. Which matches the ellipse equation x² + 4y² = 4. Good.\n\nSo now, we have all three vertices of the triangle: (0,1), (8√3/13, -11/13), (-8√3/13, -11/13). Now, we need to find the length of each side. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides should be equal. Let me compute the distance between (0,1) and (8√3/13, -11/13), then check if the distance between the other two points is the same.\n\nFirst, distance between (0,1) and (8√3/13, -11/13):\n\nsqrt[ (8√3/13 - 0)^2 + (-11/13 - 1)^2 ].\n\nCompute each component:\n\nx-component squared: (8√3/13)^2 = 64*3 / 169 = 192/169.\n\ny-component: (-11/13 - 13/13) = -24/13. Squared: ( -24/13 )^2 = 576/169.\n\nTotal distance squared: 192/169 + 576/169 = 768/169.\n\nTherefore, distance is sqrt(768/169) = sqrt(768)/13. Simplify sqrt(768):\n\nsqrt(768) = sqrt(256 * 3) = 16√3. Therefore, distance is 16√3 / 13.\n\nAlternatively, the distance between the other two points: between (8√3/13, -11/13) and (-8√3/13, -11/13):\n\nsqrt[ (-8√3/13 - 8√3/13)^2 + (-11/13 - (-11/13))^2 ] = sqrt[ (-16√3/13)^2 + 0 ] = sqrt( (256*3)/169 ) = sqrt(768)/13 = same as before. So yes, both sides are equal, as expected. Therefore, each side has length 16√3 / 13. Therefore, the problem says the length is sqrt(m/n). Let me check if 16√3 / 13 can be written as sqrt(m/n).\n\nCompute (16√3 / 13)^2 = (256 * 3) / 169 = 768 / 169. Therefore, the length is sqrt(768/169). Therefore, m = 768 and n = 169. Are they coprime? Let me check.\n\nFind GCD of 768 and 169. 169 is 13². 768 divided by 13: 13*59 = 767, so 768 is 13*59 + 1, so remainder 1. Therefore, GCD(768,169) = GCD(169,1) = 1. Therefore, 768 and 169 are coprime? Wait, but 768 is 256*3, which is 2^8 * 3. 169 is 13². No common factors. Therefore yes, they are coprime. Therefore, m = 768, n = 169. Therefore, m + n = 768 + 169 = 937.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Wait 768/169. Let me confirm if my calculation is correct. The distance squared between (0,1) and (8√3/13, -11/13) is 192/169 + 576/169 = 768/169. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the length is sqrt(768/169). Therefore, m is 768, n is 169, which are coprime. Therefore, answer is 768 + 169 = 937. Hmm. But let me check if that's the case.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there is an error in my reasoning. The problem says \"each side is sqrt(m/n)\", so if my calculation is correct, that's the answer. However, 768 seems a bit large. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate the distance squared between (0,1) and (8√3/13, -11/13):\n\nx-coordinate difference is 8√3/13 - 0 = 8√3/13. Squared is (64 * 3)/169 = 192/169.\n\ny-coordinate difference is -11/13 - 1 = -11/13 - 13/13 = -24/13. Squared is 576/169. Total is 192 + 576 = 768 over 169. Yes, correct. So sqrt(768/169). So that's correct. Therefore, m is 768 and n is 169, which are coprime. Therefore, 768 + 169 = 937. Hmm.\n\nBut let me check if the problem says \"each side is sqrt(m/n)\", so sqrt(768/169) is equal to sqrt(768)/sqrt(169) = (16√3)/13, which is what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me check if there is another way to approach this problem, maybe I missed something. For example, maybe there are other vertices? Wait, but according to the problem statement, one altitude is along the y-axis. Since we have an equilateral triangle with one vertex at (0,1) and altitude along y-axis, which we used to deduce the other two points are symmetric across y-axis. So seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another triangle? But given the constraints, probably unique. Let me check if the points are correct.\n\nSo points are (0,1), (8√3/13, -11/13), (-8√3/13, -11/13). Let me check if they form an equilateral triangle. We checked two sides, but maybe check another side? For example, between (-8√3/13, -11/13) and (0,1). It should be same as before. Yes, symmetric, so same calculation. So yes, same distance. So all sides equal. So seems correct.\n\nTherefore, answer is 768 + 169 = 937. But let me check if 768 and 169 are co-prime. 169 is 13 squared. 768 divided by 13 is 59.07... Let me do exact division: 13*59 = 767. So 768 = 13*59 + 1, so remainder 1. Therefore, GCD(768, 169) is GCD(169,1) = 1. Therefore yes, co-prime. Therefore, m + n is 768 + 169 = 937. Therefore, answer is 937. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in solving the quadratic equation. Let me check again:\n\nWe had 13b² - 2b - 11 = 0. Then discriminant D = 4 + 4*13*11. Wait, discriminant is b² - 4ac. Wait, original quadratic is 13b² - 2b - 11 = 0. Therefore, discriminant is (-2)^2 - 4*13*(-11) = 4 + 572 = 576. Correct. sqrt(576) = 24. Therefore, solutions [2 ± 24]/26. So [2 + 24]/26 = 26/26 = 1, and [2 - 24]/26 = -22/26 = -11/13. Correct. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, seems like the answer is 937. But let me check with another approach. Maybe parametrize the ellipse?\n\nAlternatively, since the ellipse is x² + 4y² = 4, parametric equations can be written as x = 2 cos θ, y = sin θ, since (2 cos θ)^2 + 4 (sin θ)^2 = 4 cos² θ + 4 sin² θ = 4 (cos² θ + sin² θ) = 4. So parametric equations are x = 2 cos θ, y = sin θ.\n\nSo the three points of the triangle can be parametrized. Given that one point is (0,1), which corresponds to θ = π/2, since cos(π/2) = 0, sin(π/2) = 1. The other two points are symmetric across the y-axis, so their angles would be θ and -θ. Let me denote them as θ and -θ. Therefore, their coordinates are (2 cos θ, sin θ) and ( -2 cos θ, sin θ). Therefore, same as before, since they are symmetric across y-axis.\n\nTherefore, we can use this parametrization to find θ. Then, since the triangle is equilateral, the distance between (0,1) and (2 cos θ, sin θ) should be equal to the distance between (2 cos θ, sin θ) and (-2 cos θ, sin θ). Which is same as before. The distance between (2 cos θ, sin θ) and (-2 cos θ, sin θ) is sqrt[ ( -2 cos θ - 2 cos θ )² + ( sin θ - sin θ )² ] = sqrt[ (-4 cos θ )² + 0 ] = 4 |cos θ|. The distance between (0,1) and (2 cos θ, sin θ) is sqrt[ (2 cos θ - 0 )² + ( sin θ - 1 )² ] = sqrt[ 4 cos² θ + (sin θ - 1 )² ].\n\nSetting equal to 4 |cos θ|:\n\nsqrt[ 4 cos² θ + (sin θ - 1 )² ] = 4 |cos θ|.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n4 cos² θ + (sin θ - 1 )² = 16 cos² θ.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(sin θ - 1 )² = 12 cos² θ.\n\nExpand left side:\n\nsin² θ - 2 sin θ + 1 = 12 cos² θ.\n\nReplace cos² θ with 1 - sin² θ:\n\nsin² θ - 2 sin θ + 1 = 12 (1 - sin² θ )\n\nExpand right side:\n\nsin² θ - 2 sin θ + 1 = 12 - 12 sin² θ.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nsin² θ - 2 sin θ + 1 - 12 + 12 sin² θ = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n13 sin² θ - 2 sin θ - 11 = 0.\n\nWhich is same equation as before, except in terms of sin θ. Let me check:\n\nYes, if we let b = sin θ, then this is 13b² - 2b - 11 = 0, same as before. Therefore, solutions are b = [2 ± 24]/26, which gives sin θ = 1 or sin θ = -11/13. As before, sin θ = 1 gives degenerate triangle, so sin θ = -11/13. Therefore, θ is an angle where sin θ = -11/13, so cos θ = sqrt(1 - sin² θ ) = sqrt(1 - 121/169) = sqrt(48/169) = 4√3 / 13. But since θ could be in different quadrants, but since we have points (2 cos θ, sin θ) and (-2 cos θ, sin θ), cos θ can be positive or negative, but since we already have ±a, so cos θ is positive here. Therefore, cos θ = 4√3 /13. Therefore, 2 cos θ = 8√3 /13, which matches our previous value of a. Therefore, same result. Therefore, the length of the side is 4 |cos θ| = 4*(4√3 /13) = 16√3 /13, same as before. Therefore, same result. Therefore, seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 768 + 169 = 937.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's another possible configuration. The problem states that one altitude is contained in the y-axis. In our case, the altitude from (0,1) is along the y-axis to the midpoint of the opposite side. However, in an equilateral triangle, all altitudes are the same, so if there was another altitude along the y-axis, but given that the triangle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, maybe another altitude? But since the triangle is symmetric across the y-axis, the altitude from the midpoint of the left and right vertices would be along the y-axis? Wait, the midpoint of the two other vertices is (0, b) which is on the y-axis. Therefore, the altitude from that midpoint? Wait, in an equilateral triangle, all altitudes coincide with medians and perpendicular bisectors. Therefore, the line from (0, b) to (0,1) is both a median and altitude. So yes, that altitude is along the y-axis. So our configuration is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that another altitude is along the y-axis, but given the vertex is at (0,1), probably the altitude from there is along the y-axis. So seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another triangle where a different altitude is along the y-axis? For example, if one of the other vertices had an altitude along the y-axis. But given that the triangle is symmetric across the y-axis, if another altitude is along the y-axis, it would have to be from one of the other vertices. But let me think.\n\nSuppose we have vertex at (a, b), and altitude from there is along the y-axis. Then, the altitude is a vertical line, so the opposite side must be horizontal. The opposite side would be between (0,1) and (-a, b). Wait, but that side is not horizontal. The midpoint of (0,1) and (-a, b) is (-a/2, (1 + b)/2). The altitude from (a, b) would go to that midpoint. If the altitude is vertical, then the line from (a, b) to (-a/2, (1 + b)/2) must be vertical. Therefore, the x-coordinate must be same. Therefore, a must equal -a/2. Therefore, a + a/2 = 0 => 3a/2 = 0 => a = 0. But if a = 0, then points are (0, b) and (0, b), which again collapses. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, only possible altitude along the y-axis is from (0,1). Therefore, our initial assumption is correct. Therefore, unique triangle under given constraints. Therefore, answer is 937.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 937.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{937}\n</think>"}
