The sum is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (ir)^k = \\frac{1}{1 - ir}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the complex coordinate of $ B $ is:\n\n$$\nB = (1 - r) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - ir}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Expression\n\nTo find the distance from the origin to $ B $, we compute the modulus of $ B $:\n\n$$\n|B| = \\left| (1 - r) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - ir} \\right| = \\frac{1 - r}{|1 - ir|}\n$$\n\nNow compute $ |1 - ir| $:\n\n$$\n|1 - ir| = \\sqrt{1^2 + r^2} = \\sqrt{1 + r^2}\n$$\n\nSo the distance from the origin to $ B $ is:\n\n$$\n|B| = \\frac{1 - r}{\\sqrt{1 + r^2}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Plugging in $ r = \\frac{11}{60} $\n\nWe compute:\n\n- $ 1 - r = 1 - \\frac{11}{60} = \\frac{49}{60} $\n- $ r^2 = \\left(\\frac{11}{60}\\right)^2 = \\frac{121}{3600} $\n- $ 1 + r^2 = 1 + \\frac{121}{3600} = \\frac{3721}{3600} $\n- $ \\sqrt{1 + r^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3721}{3600}} = \\frac{61}{60} $, since $ 61^2 = 3721 $\n\nSo the distance becomes:\n\n$$\n|B| = \\frac{49/60}{61/60} = \\frac{49}{61}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Computation\n\nGiven that the distance is $ \\frac{49}{61} $, with numerator and denominator relatively prime, the problem asks for $ m + n $ where the distance is $ \\frac{m}{n} $.\n\n$$\nm + n = 49 + 61 = \\boxed{110}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about circles and points. Let me try to understand the problem step by step. \n\nWe have circle C₀ with radius 1, and a point A₀ on it. Then there's circle C₁ with radius r (which is less than 1) that is internally tangent to C₀ at A₀. Then point A₁ is on C₁, 90 degrees counterclockwise from A₀ on C₁. Then circle C₂ has radius r² and is internally tangent to C₁ at A₁, and so on. Each subsequent circle is smaller by a factor of r and turned 90 degrees counterclockwise. All these circles have a common point B inside them, and when r is 11/60, we need to find the distance from the center of C₀ (which I assume is the origin) to point B, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The first circle C₀ is radius 1, let's say centered at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Point A₀ is on C₀. Let me assume without loss of generality that A₀ is at (1, 0), since we can rotate the coordinate system as needed. \n\nThen circle C₁ is tangent to C₀ at A₀, and has radius r. Since it's internally tangent, the center of C₁ must be along the line connecting the centers of C₀ and the point of tangency. Since C₀ is centered at (0,0) and tangent at (1,0), the center of C₁ must be r units away from A₀ towards the interior of C₀. Wait, the distance between centers of C₀ and C₁ should be equal to the difference in radii because they are internally tangent. The radius of C₀ is 1, and the radius of C₁ is r, so the distance between centers is 1 - r. Since they are tangent at A₀, which is on the circumference of both circles. Therefore, the center of C₁ is located at (1 - (1 - r), 0) = (r, 0)? Wait, no. Wait, if the center of C₀ is at (0,0) and the point of tangency is at (1,0), then the center of C₁ lies along the line connecting (0,0) to (1,0). The distance between centers is 1 - r. Therefore, starting from (0,0), moving towards (1,0) by a distance of 1 - r? Wait no, if the center of C₁ is inside C₀, then from C₀'s center, moving towards the point of tangency (which is on C₀'s circumference), the center of C₁ is located at a distance of 1 - r from C₀'s center. Therefore, coordinates would be ( (1 - r), 0 ). Wait, but the point of tangency is at (1,0). The center of C₁ must be located at a distance of 1 - r from (0,0), and also at a distance of r from (1,0). Let me verify that.\n\nLet me denote center of C₁ as O₁. Then |O₁ - (0,0)| = 1 - r, and |O₁ - (1,0)| = r. Let me solve for O₁. Let me assume O₁ is on the x-axis at (h, 0). Then distance from (0,0) is h = 1 - r. Distance from (1,0) is |h - 1| = |(1 - r) - 1| = | - r | = r. Perfect, so that works. Therefore, center of C₁ is at (1 - r, 0).\n\nNow, point A₁ is on C₁, 90 degrees counterclockwise from A₀ on C₁. Let me think about how to find coordinates of A₁. Since A₀ is the point of tangency between C₀ and C₁, which is (1,0). On circle C₁, starting at A₀ (which is (1,0)), moving 90 degrees counterclockwise around C₁. Since circle C₁ is centered at (1 - r, 0) with radius r. Let me parametrize circle C₁. The center is at (h, 0) where h = 1 - r. So, parametric equations for C₁ can be written as (h + r cos θ, 0 + r sin θ), where θ is the angle parameter. \n\nAt point A₀, which is (1, 0), let's see what θ is. So:\n\nh + r cos θ = 1  \n0 + r sin θ = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, sin θ = 0, so θ = 0 or π. But since the circle is inside C₀, and tangent at (1,0), the center is at (h, 0) = (1 - r, 0). Therefore, the point (1, 0) is in the direction of θ = 0 from the center. So θ = 0 corresponds to (h + r*1, 0 + 0) = (h + r, 0) = (1 - r + r, 0) = (1, 0). Correct. Therefore, θ = 0 corresponds to A₀. Then moving 90 degrees counterclockwise on C₁ would be θ = π/2. Therefore, coordinates of A₁ would be:\n\nx = h + r cos(π/2) = (1 - r) + r * 0 = 1 - r  \ny = 0 + r sin(π/2) = 0 + r * 1 = r  \nTherefore, A₁ is at (1 - r, r).\n\nOkay, so that's A₁. Then circle C₂ is tangent to C₁ at A₁, has radius r², and is internally tangent. So similar logic applies. Let me find the center of C₂. Let's denote the center of C₂ as O₂. Since it's internally tangent to C₁ at A₁, the distance between O₁ and O₂ should be equal to the difference in radii of C₁ and C₂, which is r - r² = r(1 - r). Also, O₂ lies along the line connecting O₁ and A₁. \n\nO₁ is at (1 - r, 0), and A₁ is at (1 - r, r). So the line connecting O₁ to A₁ is vertical, going from (1 - r, 0) up to (1 - r, r). Therefore, the center O₂ is along this line, at a distance of r - r² from O₁ towards A₁. Wait, since it's internally tangent, the center O₂ is located towards A₁ from O₁ by a distance equal to radius of C₁ minus radius of C₂. Wait, radius of C₁ is r, radius of C₂ is r², so the distance between O₁ and O₂ is r - r². Therefore, starting at O₁, moving towards A₁ by r - r². The vector from O₁ to A₁ is (0, r). So moving a distance of r - r² along this vector. The total length of the vector is r, so moving a fraction of (r - r²)/r = 1 - r. Therefore, the coordinates of O₂ would be:\n\nStarting at (1 - r, 0), moving up by (1 - r)*r in the y-direction? Wait, no. Wait, the vector from O₁ to A₁ is (0, r). If we move a distance of (r - r²) from O₁ towards A₁, then since the total length is r, the fraction is (r - r²)/r = 1 - r. Therefore, the coordinates are:\n\nO₂_x = 1 - r + 0*(1 - r) = 1 - r  \nO₂_y = 0 + r*(1 - r) = r(1 - r)  \nTherefore, center of C₂ is at (1 - r, r(1 - r)).\n\nNow, point A₂ is on C₂, 90 degrees counterclockwise from A₁ on C₂. Let me figure out coordinates of A₂. \n\nFirst, circle C₂ is centered at (1 - r, r(1 - r)) with radius r². Point A₁ is the point of tangency between C₁ and C₂, which is (1 - r, r). Let me check if that's on circle C₂. The distance from O₂ to A₁ is sqrt[( (1 - r) - (1 - r) )² + ( r - r(1 - r) )²] = sqrt[0 + ( r - r + r² )²] = sqrt[ (r²)² ] = r². Wait, but radius of C₂ is r², so yes, A₁ is on C₂. Correct.\n\nNow, moving 90 degrees counterclockwise from A₁ on C₂. Let me parametrize circle C₂. Let me consider the angle parameter θ for circle C₂. Since A₁ is a point on C₂, let me find what angle corresponds to A₁. \n\nThe center of C₂ is at (h, k) = (1 - r, r(1 - r)). The point A₁ is at (1 - r, r). Let me compute the vector from O₂ to A₁: (1 - r - h, r - k) = (0, r - r(1 - r)) = (0, r - r + r²) = (0, r²). Therefore, this vector is straight up along the positive y-axis. Therefore, if we consider the standard parametrization of the circle, θ = 0 corresponds to the direction of the positive x-axis from the center. However, the point A₁ is along the positive y-axis from the center, which would correspond to θ = π/2. Therefore, moving 90 degrees counterclockwise from A₁ on C₂ would be θ = π/2 + π/2 = π. Therefore, the coordinates of A₂ would be:\n\nx = h + r² cos(π) = (1 - r) + r² * (-1) = 1 - r - r²  \ny = k + r² sin(π) = r(1 - r) + 0 = r(1 - r)\n\nWait, let me check. If θ = π, then cos π = -1, sin π = 0, so yes. Therefore, A₂ is at (1 - r - r², r(1 - r)).\n\nAlternatively, moving 90 degrees counterclockwise from A₁ on C₂. Since A₁ is at the top of C₂ (in the direction of positive y-axis from O₂), moving 90 degrees counterclockwise would point towards the negative x-direction from O₂. Therefore, coordinates would be O₂_x - r², O₂_y. Which is (1 - r - r², r(1 - r)). Correct.\n\nOkay, so A₂ is at (1 - r - r², r(1 - r)).\n\nNow, moving on to circle C₃, which is tangent to C₂ at A₂, radius r³, internally tangent. Let me find the center of C₃, O₃. The distance between O₂ and O₃ is r² - r³ = r²(1 - r). The direction from O₂ to A₂ is the direction towards which O₃ lies. \n\nPoint A₂ is on C₂ at (1 - r - r², r(1 - r)). The center of C₂ is at O₂ = (1 - r, r(1 - r)). Therefore, the vector from O₂ to A₂ is (-r², 0). So it's pointing to the left along the x-axis. Therefore, moving from O₂ towards A₂ by a distance of r² - r³. \n\nThe vector from O₂ to A₂ is (-r², 0), which has length r². Therefore, moving a distance of r² - r³ along this vector is scaling the vector by (r² - r³)/r² = 1 - r. Therefore, the coordinates of O₃ are:\n\nO₂_x + (-r²)(1 - r) = (1 - r) - r²(1 - r)  \nO₂_y + 0*(1 - r) = r(1 - r)  \n\nCalculating O₃_x:\n\n(1 - r) - r²(1 - r) = (1 - r)(1 - r²) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, expanding:\n\n(1 - r) - r²(1 - r) = (1 - r)[1 - r²]? No. Wait, 1 - r - r² + r³. Wait, perhaps factor differently. Let me compute it directly:\n\nO₃_x = 1 - r - r²(1 - r)  \n= 1 - r - r² + r³  \nSimilarly, O₃_y remains r(1 - r).\n\nSo center of C₃ is at (1 - r - r² + r³, r(1 - r)).\n\nNow, point A₃ is on C₃, 90 degrees counterclockwise from A₂ on C₃. Let me find coordinates of A₃.\n\nFirst, circle C₃ is centered at O₃ = (1 - r - r² + r³, r(1 - r)) with radius r³. The point A₂ is the point of tangency between C₂ and C₃, which is at (1 - r - r², r(1 - r)). Let me check the vector from O₃ to A₂. \n\nO₃_x = 1 - r - r² + r³  \nA₂_x = 1 - r - r²  \nSo difference in x-coordinate: A₂_x - O₃_x = [1 - r - r²] - [1 - r - r² + r³] = - r³  \nDifference in y-coordinate: A₂_y - O₃_y = r(1 - r) - r(1 - r) = 0  \nTherefore, vector from O₃ to A₂ is (-r³, 0), which is pointing to the left along the x-axis. Therefore, similar to previous steps, θ for A₂ on circle C₃ is π (pointing to the left), so moving 90 degrees counterclockwise would be θ = π + π/2 = 3π/2, which points downward. Therefore, coordinates of A₃ would be:\n\nx = O₃_x + r³ cos(3π/2) = O₃_x + 0 = O₃_x  \ny = O₃_y + r³ sin(3π/2) = O₃_y - r³  \n\nTherefore, coordinates of A₃:\n\nx = 1 - r - r² + r³  \ny = r(1 - r) - r³ = r - r² - r³\n\nSo A₃ is at (1 - r - r² + r³, r - r² - r³).\n\nNow, continuing this pattern, each subsequent circle is turning 90 degrees counterclockwise, and the centers and points are being adjusted accordingly. \n\nNow, the problem mentions that there is a common point B inside all these circles. I need to find the coordinates of B, which is the limit of the centers of the circles? Or perhaps the limit of the points A_n? Or maybe the intersection point of all circles? Since all circles are nested and shrinking, by the nested interval theorem (in 2D), there should be a unique common point B. \n\nBut how do I find B? It seems that each circle is tangent to the previous one at A_{n-1}, and the point B is inside all circles. Perhaps B is the limit of the centers of the circles? Or maybe the limit of the points A_n? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since each circle is tangent to the previous one, and each subsequent circle is rotated 90 degrees, maybe the position of B can be found by considering the infinite series of movements from each center to the next. \n\nLooking at the centers of the circles:\n\n- O₀ is the center of C₀, which is (0,0).\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"the center C₀\" – probably a typo, should be the center of C₀, which we can take as (0,0).\n\nThen O₁ is at (1 - r, 0)\n\nO₂ is at (1 - r, r(1 - r))\n\nO₃ is at (1 - r - r² + r³, r(1 - r))\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me try to find a recursive relationship for the centers.\n\nAlternatively, since each circle is tangent to the previous one, and each time we move in a direction rotated 90 degrees from the previous direction. Let me think in terms of complex numbers. Maybe that would make it easier to handle rotations.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me model the centers as complex numbers. Let me denote O₀ = 0 (the origin). Then O₁ is at position (1 - r) on the real axis, which is the complex number z₁ = 1 - r.\n\nThen, to get from O₁ to O₂, we moved upward by r(1 - r). Wait, but in complex plane, moving upward is multiplying by i. However, the displacement from O₁ to O₂ is a vector. Let me think about the displacement between centers.\n\nEach time, when going from O_{n-1} to O_n, the displacement is a vector of length (r^{n-1} - r^n) = r^{n-1}(1 - r) in a direction that is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from the previous displacement.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFrom O₀ to O₁: displacement is z₁ - z₀ = (1 - r) - 0 = 1 - r, which is along the real axis (direction 0 degrees).\n\nFrom O₁ to O₂: displacement is z₂ - z₁. From earlier, O₂ is at (1 - r, r(1 - r)), so z₂ - z₁ is 0 + r(1 - r)i, which is purely imaginary, direction 90 degrees (counterclockwise from previous direction).\n\nFrom O₂ to O₃: displacement is z₃ - z₂. Earlier, O₃ is at (1 - r - r² + r³, r(1 - r)), so z₃ - z₂ is [ - r² + r³ ] + 0i = - r²(1 - r). Wait, but according to earlier calculation, O₃_x = 1 - r - r² + r³, so displacement from O₂ (which has x-coordinate 1 - r - r²?) Wait, no, earlier O₂ was at (1 - r, r(1 - r)), then O₃_x was 1 - r - r² + r³. Therefore, displacement from O₂ to O₃ is ( - r² + r³, 0 ). So in complex plane, that is (- r²(1 - r), 0 ), which is along the negative real axis, direction 180 degrees from the previous displacement direction (which was 90 degrees). So another 90 degrees counterclockwise. \n\nSimilarly, displacement from O₃ to O₄ would be in direction 270 degrees (i.e., downward), and so on. So each displacement is multiplied by i (rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise) and scaled by r each time?\n\nWait, let's check the magnitudes. The displacement from O₀ to O₁ has magnitude 1 - r. Then displacement from O₁ to O₂ has magnitude r(1 - r). Then displacement from O₂ to O₃ has magnitude r²(1 - r). Etc. So each displacement is (1 - r) multiplied by r^{k} for the k-th displacement. And each displacement is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from the previous one. \n\nTherefore, if I consider the position of the center O_n as the sum of all these displacements from O₀. Therefore, the position of B, which is inside all circles, is the limit of the centers O_n as n approaches infinity? Or is it the limit of some other sequence?\n\nWait, actually, since each subsequent circle is smaller and tangent to the previous, the centers are approaching point B? Or maybe not. Alternatively, since each circle contains the next one, and they are all tangent at points A_n, perhaps B is the limit of points A_n? \n\nAlternatively, since B is inside all circles, and each circle C_n is tangent to the next one, perhaps B is the common point of tangency? But since each circle is tangent to the next at a different point A_n, which are different points. Therefore, B must be a different point.\n\nAlternatively, since all circles pass through B? Wait, no, because they are tangent to each other, so they only share the point of tangency. But each circle C_n is tangent to C_{n-1} at A_{n-1}, so B cannot be on all circles unless it's the common intersection point, but since each subsequent circle is smaller and rotated, there's only one common point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is the common intersection point of all the circles. But how to find it?\n\nAlternatively, since each center O_n is approaching B? Let me think. If we consider the centers O_n, each subsequent center is obtained by adding a displacement vector. If we take the limit of O_n as n approaches infinity, that might be point B. Let me check with the Asymptote code figure. The figure shows circles getting smaller and rotated, and there's a common point B inside all of them. If the centers are spiraling towards B, then yes, taking the limit of O_n would give B. \n\nAssuming that, then the coordinates of B can be found by summing the infinite series of displacements from O₀ to O₁, O₁ to O₂, etc. \n\nSo, in complex numbers, let me model this. Let me denote each displacement as a complex number. The first displacement is d₁ = (1 - r). The next displacement is d₂ = i * r(1 - r). The next displacement is d₃ = i² * r²(1 - r). The next is d₄ = i³ * r³(1 - r), etc. \n\nTherefore, the total displacement from O₀ to B is the sum:\n\nB = d₁ + d₂ + d₃ + d₄ + ...  \n= (1 - r) + i r(1 - r) + i² r²(1 - r) + i³ r³(1 - r) + ...  \n= (1 - r) * Σ_{k=0}^∞ (i r)^k  \n\nBecause each term is (i r)^k multiplied by (1 - r). Wait, let's check:\n\nFor k=0: (i r)^0 = 1, multiplied by (1 - r): term is (1 - r)\n\nFor k=1: (i r)^1 = i r, multiplied by (1 - r): term is i r (1 - r)\n\nWait, but in our sum above, we have (1 - r) * Σ_{k=0}^∞ (i r)^k ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum is:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^∞ (i r)^k * (1 - r) ?\n\nWait, actually, the first term is (1 - r) = (1 - r) * (i r)^0\n\nSecond term is i r (1 - r) = (1 - r) * (i r)^1\n\nThird term is i² r² (1 - r) = (1 - r) * (i r)^2\n\nYes! Therefore, the entire sum is (1 - r) * Σ_{k=0}^∞ (i r)^k.\n\nNow, Σ_{k=0}^∞ (i r)^k is a geometric series with common ratio (i r). Since |i r| = r < 1 (given r < 1), the series converges. The sum is 1 / (1 - i r).\n\nTherefore, total displacement B is:\n\nB = (1 - r) * [1 / (1 - i r)].\n\nTherefore, we can compute this complex number and then find its magnitude, which is the distance from the origin (center of C₀) to point B.\n\nLet me compute this. \n\nFirst, compute 1 / (1 - i r). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i r):\n\n1 / (1 - i r) = (1 + i r) / [ (1 - i r)(1 + i r) ] = (1 + i r) / (1 + r²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nB = (1 - r) * (1 + i r) / (1 + r²)  \n= [ (1 - r)(1 + i r) ] / (1 + r²)\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nMultiply out numerator:\n\n(1 - r)(1 + i r) = 1*(1) + 1*(i r) - r*(1) - r*(i r)  \n= 1 + i r - r - i r²  \n= (1 - r) + i r (1 - r i) ?\n\nWait, let me write it step by step:\n\nFirst term: 1 * 1 = 1  \nSecond term: 1 * i r = i r  \nThird term: -r * 1 = -r  \nFourth term: -r * i r = -i r²  \nTherefore, combining real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal: 1 - r  \nImaginary: r - r² i? Wait, no. Wait, the fourth term is -i r², so imaginary part is r - r², multiplied by i?\n\nWait, the total expression is:\n\nReal part: 1 - r  \nImaginary part: r - r²  \nWait, because:\n\nOriginal expression: 1 + i r - r - i r²  \nGroup real parts: 1 - r  \nGroup imaginary parts: r - r²  \nTherefore, the numerator is (1 - r) + i (r - r²)  \nTherefore, B = [ (1 - r) + i r (1 - r) ] / (1 + r²)  \nWait, because r - r² = r(1 - r). So:\n\nB = [ (1 - r) + i r (1 - r) ] / (1 + r²)  \nFactor out (1 - r):\n\nB = (1 - r) [ 1 + i r ] / (1 + r²)\n\nWait, but we already had that earlier. Anyway, regardless, breaking into real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: (1 - r)/(1 + r²)  \nImaginary part: (1 - r) * r / (1 + r²)\n\nTherefore, coordinates of B are ( (1 - r)/(1 + r²), r(1 - r)/(1 + r²) )\n\nTherefore, the distance from the origin (center of C₀) to B is the modulus of this complex number, which is sqrt[ (Real part)^2 + (Imaginary part)^2 ].\n\nBut since B is obtained by summing the geometric series, and since the modulus of B is |B| = |(1 - r)| * |1 / (1 - i r)|. Since |1 - i r| = sqrt(1 + r²), then |B| = (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²). Wait, but if I compute sqrt[ ( (1 - r)^2/(1 + r²)^2 ) + ( r²(1 - r)^2/(1 + r²)^2 ) ] = sqrt[ (1 - r)^2 (1 + r²) / (1 + r²)^2 ) ] = sqrt[ (1 - r)^2 / (1 + r²) ) ] = (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²). \n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, when r = 11/60, we need to compute this distance. However, according to my calculation, it's (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²). But let me check if this is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning was that B is the limit of centers O_n, which is given by the sum of displacements. However, let me verify with the first few terms.\n\nFor example, take r approaching 0. Then B should approach (1 - 0)/sqrt(1 + 0) = 1, which makes sense because if r is 0, then the first circle C₁ would have radius 0 at point A₀, so all subsequent circles are zero, and the common point B is A₀, which is at distance 1 from the origin. So that checks out.\n\nAnother check: take r = 0, but that's trivial. Maybe take r = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7, but r < 1. Then distance would be (1 - 1/√2)/sqrt(1 + 1/2) = (1 - 1/√2)/sqrt(3/2) = ... Not sure if that helps. \n\nBut according to the problem, when r = 11/60, compute this distance. However, according to my calculation, the distance is (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²). Let me compute that.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, according to my previous reasoning, B is the limit of centers O_n. However, is that actually correct? Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says there is one point B inside all of these circles. So B must satisfy being inside every circle C_n. Each circle C_n is centered at O_n with radius r^n. Therefore, for B to be inside all circles, the distance between B and O_n must be less than or equal to r^n for all n ≥ 0. However, if B is the limit of O_n, then as n approaches infinity, the distance between B and O_n approaches zero, which is certainly less than r^n (since r < 1). Therefore, that seems plausible. But how do we know that B is inside all the circles? For example, for n = 0, circle C₀ is radius 1, centered at O₀ (origin). The distance from B to O₀ is |B|, which according to my formula is (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²). For r = 11/60, let's compute this value and check if it's less than 1. But since r is positive and less than 1, numerator is less than 1, denominator is greater than 1, so overall it's less than 1. So yes, inside C₀. For n = 1, circle C₁ is radius r, centered at O₁. The distance between B and O₁ should be less than or equal to r. Let me check:\n\nDistance between B and O₁: |B - O₁|. Since O₁ is at (1 - r, 0), and B is at ( (1 - r)/(1 + r²), r(1 - r)/(1 + r²) ). Therefore, the difference in coordinates:\n\nΔx = (1 - r)/(1 + r²) - (1 - r) = (1 - r)[1/(1 + r²) - 1] = (1 - r)[ (1 - (1 + r²)) / (1 + r²) ) ] = (1 - r)[ (- r²) / (1 + r²) ) ] = - r² (1 - r)/(1 + r²)\n\nΔy = r(1 - r)/(1 + r²) - 0 = r(1 - r)/(1 + r²)\n\nTherefore, distance squared is [ - r² (1 - r)/(1 + r²) ]² + [ r(1 - r)/(1 + r²) ]²\n\n= r^4 (1 - r)^2 / (1 + r²)^2 + r² (1 - r)^2 / (1 + r²)^2  \n= [ r^4 + r² ] (1 - r)^2 / (1 + r²)^2  \n= r² (r² + 1) (1 - r)^2 / (1 + r²)^2  \n= r² (1 - r)^2 / (1 + r²)\n\nTherefore, distance is r (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²)\n\nWhich is equal to r times the distance from origin to B. Since r < 1, and distance from origin to B is (1 - r)/sqrt(...), then the distance from B to O₁ is r*(distance from origin to B). Therefore, since for B to be inside C₁, this distance must be ≤ r. Let's check:\n\ndistance(B, O₁) = r * |B|  \nWe need r * |B| ≤ r ⇒ |B| ≤ 1, which is true as we saw earlier. Therefore, equality holds when |B| = 1, but since |B| = (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²) < 1, then indeed distance(B, O₁) < r. Therefore, B is inside C₁. Similarly, for each subsequent circle C_n, the distance from B to O_n would be r^n * |B|, which is less than r^n, since |B| < 1. Therefore, B is indeed inside all circles. \n\nTherefore, my calculation for |B| is correct. Therefore, when r = 11/60, compute |B| = (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²).\n\nLet me compute that. First compute 1 - r:\n\n1 - 11/60 = 49/60\n\nCompute r²:\n\n(11/60)^2 = 121/3600\n\nTherefore, 1 + r² = 1 + 121/3600 = 3600/3600 + 121/3600 = 3721/3600\n\nTherefore sqrt(1 + r²) = sqrt(3721/3600) = sqrt(3721)/sqrt(3600) = 61/60. Because 61² = 3721 (since 60²=3600, 61²=3600 + 120 + 1 = 3721). Yes.\n\nTherefore, |B| = (49/60) / (61/60) = 49/61.\n\nWait, so the distance from the origin to B is 49/61. Therefore, m is 49, n is 61, which are coprime (since 49 is 7², 61 is prime, and 61 doesn't divide 49). Therefore, m + n is 49 + 61 = 110.\n\nBut wait, let me check my steps again because this seems straightforward, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming B is the limit of centers?\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, there is a point B inside all circles. My calculation shows that the distance from the origin is 49/61 when r = 11/60. However, let me check with an example. Let me take r approaching 0. If r approaches 0, then |B| approaches (1 - 0)/sqrt(1 + 0) = 1, which is correct because all circles would be shrinking towards the point A₀, which is on the circumference of C₀ at distance 1. However, if r approaches 1, then |B| approaches (1 - 1)/sqrt(1 + 1) = 0, which also makes sense because the circles would be getting larger and approaching C₀, so the common point would be the center?\n\nWait, if r approaches 1, then C₁ is almost the same size as C₀, tangent at A₀, then C₂ is almost the same size as C₁, etc. But since each subsequent circle is rotated 90 degrees, they might spiral towards the center? If r approaches 1, the distance |B| approaches 0. That seems plausible because with r near 1, each subsequent circle is almost the same size, but rotated, so the centers spiral towards the center of C₀. Therefore, the formula seems to hold in edge cases.\n\nTherefore, given that, with r = 11/60, the distance is 49/61. Therefore, m + n = 49 + 61 = 110. However, let me check the problem statement again to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the distance from the center C₀ to B\". Assuming that \"center C₀\" refers to the center of circle C₀, which we took as (0,0). Our calculation gives 49/61. However, let me check my calculation again step by step.\n\nGiven r = 11/60.\n\nCompute 1 - r = 49/60.\n\nCompute 1 + r² = 1 + (121/3600) = 3721/3600. Square root of that is 61/60. Therefore, (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²) = (49/60)/(61/60) = 49/61. Yes, correct.\n\nBut let me think again if there is a different approach. For example, maybe the coordinates of B are the limit of points A_n? Let me check with the first few points.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nA₀ = (1, 0)\n\nA₁ = (1 - r, r)\n\nA₂ = (1 - r - r², r(1 - r))\n\nA₃ = (1 - r - r² + r³, r(1 - r) - r³) = (1 - r - r² + r³, r - r² - r³)\n\nIf we consider the limit of A_n as n approaches infinity, would that also approach B? Let me see. Since each A_n is on circle C_n, which has radius r^n, and B is inside all circles. But unless A_n approaches B, which is possible. Let me try to model the coordinates of A_n as a series.\n\nLooking at the x-coordinates of A_n:\n\nA₀_x = 1  \nA₁_x = 1 - r  \nA₂_x = 1 - r - r²  \nA₃_x = 1 - r - r² + r³  \nA₄_x = ... ?\n\nWait, let me see the pattern. Let me think recursively. Each time, moving 90 degrees, so each coordinate alternates between subtracting and adding terms? \n\nAlternatively, considering complex numbers again. Let me model the points A_n as complex numbers. Starting from A₀ = 1 + 0i.\n\nTo get A₁, we move from A₀ along C₁ 90 degrees counterclockwise. But how does this relate to the centers?\n\nAlternatively, since each A_n is obtained by moving from A_{n-1} along circle C_n 90 degrees counterclockwise. However, this seems complicated. However, if B is the limit of the centers O_n, and also perhaps the limit of points A_n?\n\nBut if we consider that each circle C_n contains B, then as n increases, the radius r^n approaches zero, so the point A_n, which is on C_n, must approach B. Therefore, the limit of A_n as n approaches infinity is B. Therefore, coordinates of B can be found as the limit of A_n.\n\nTherefore, let me try to compute the coordinates of B as the sum of an infinite series based on A_n coordinates.\n\nLooking at the x-coordinate of A_n:\n\nFrom above:\n\nA₀_x = 1  \nA₁_x = 1 - r  \nA₂_x = 1 - r - r²  \nA₃_x = 1 - r - r² + r³  \nA₄_x = 1 - r - r² + r³ + r⁴  \nWait, no, let me recast:\n\nWait, A₃_x was 1 - r - r² + r³. How did we get there?\n\nFrom A₂_x = 1 - r - r². Then moving to A₃_x involves moving on circle C₃. But maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think in terms of complex numbers again.\n\nIf I consider the displacement from A₀ to A₁ to A₂ etc., but it might be complex. Alternatively, since B is the limit of A_n, and each A_n is obtained by moving from A_{n-1} around circle C_n by 90 degrees. However, since each circle C_n is centered at O_n, and A_{n} is obtained by moving 90 degrees from A_{n-1} on C_n. \n\nAlternatively, since we already have an expression for B as the limit of centers, which gave us 49/61, and verified with edge cases, and the problem gives a specific r value where the answer is a reduced fraction, which 49/61 is (since 49 and 61 are coprime), then perhaps this is correct. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check with the coordinates of A_n. For example, let me compute the x-coordinate of B as the limit of A_n_x.\n\nLooking at A₀_x = 1  \nA₁_x = 1 - r  \nA₂_x = 1 - r - r²  \nA₃_x = 1 - r - r² + r³  \nA₄_x = 1 - r - r² + r³ + r⁴  \nWait, no, let me think again. How was A₃_x obtained? From previous steps, A₃_x was 1 - r - r² + r³. Then for A₄_x, following the pattern, it might involve another term? Let me try to compute A₄.\n\nTo compute A₃, we had circle C₃, centered at O₃ with radius r³, point A₃ is 90 degrees counterclockwise from A₂ on C₃. Then circle C₄ is tangent to C₃ at A₃, radius r⁴, and A₄ is 90 degrees CCW from A₃ on C₄. \n\nFollowing previous steps, the center of C₃ is O₃ = (1 - r - r² + r³, r(1 - r)). Then displacement from O₃ to A₃ is downward (for A₃), then moving 90 degrees CCW would be... Let me recall the direction. \n\nFor circle C₃, point A₃ is at (O₃_x, O₃_y - r³). Then moving 90 degrees CCW on C₄. The center of C₄, O₄, is along the line from O₃ to A₃, distance r³ - r⁴. The vector from O₃ to A₃ is (0, -r³). Therefore, moving from O₃ towards A₃ by r³ - r⁴, which is scaling by (1 - r). Therefore, O₄ is at O₃ + (0, -r³(1 - r)) = (O₃_x, O₃_y - r³(1 - r)).\n\nTherefore, coordinates of O₄ are:\n\nx: 1 - r - r² + r³  \ny: r(1 - r) - r³(1 - r) = r(1 - r)(1 - r) = r(1 - r)^2\n\nThen point A₄ is on C₄, 90 degrees CCW from A₃. The vector from O₄ to A₃ is (O₃_x - O₄_x, O₃_y - O₄_y) ?\n\nWait, O₄ is the center of C₄, and A₃ is the point of tangency between C₃ and C₄. Therefore, A₃ lies on both C₃ and C₄. The vector from O₄ to A₃ has length equal to radius of C₄, which is r⁴. The direction from O₄ to A₃ is along the line connecting O₄ and A₃, which was the direction we moved to get from O₃ to O₄. Since O₄ is obtained by moving from O₃ towards A₃ by r³ - r⁴, then the vector from O₄ to A₃ is in the same direction as from O₃ to A₃, which was downward (negative y-axis). Therefore, A₃ is located below O₄ along the negative y-axis. Therefore, moving 90 degrees CCW on C₄ from A₃ would be towards the positive x-direction. Therefore, coordinates of A₄ would be O₄_x + r⁴, O₄_y. \n\nTherefore, A₄_x = O₄_x + r⁴ = [1 - r - r² + r³] + r⁴  \nA₄_y = O₄_y + 0 = r(1 - r)^2\n\nSo A₄_x = 1 - r - r² + r³ + r⁴\n\nContinuing this, the x-coordinate of A_n seems to follow the pattern:\n\nFor even n? Let me see:\n\nA₀_x = 1  \nA₁_x = 1 - r  \nA₂_x = 1 - r - r²  \nA₃_x = 1 - r - r² + r³  \nA₄_x = 1 - r - r² + r³ + r⁴  \nA₅_x = 1 - r - r² + r³ + r⁴ - r^5  \n... etc.\n\nThis looks like an alternating series where the sign alternates every term, but actually, the sign alternates every two terms? Wait, no. Let me write exponents:\n\nTerm 0: +1  \nTerm 1: - r  \nTerm 2: - r²  \nTerm 3: + r³  \nTerm 4: + r⁴  \nTerm 5: - r^5  \nTerm 6: - r^6  \n... etc.\n\nSo the pattern of signs is -, -, +, +, -, -, +, +,... repeating every four terms? Wait:\n\nFrom A₀_x to A₁_x: subtract r  \nA₁_x to A₂_x: subtract r²  \nA₂_x to A₃_x: add r³  \nA₃_x to A₄_x: add r⁴  \nA₄_x to A₅_x: subtract r^5  \nA₅_x to A₆_x: subtract r^6  \n... \n\nYes, so every two terms, the sign alternates. So if we consider the x-coordinate of B as the limit of A_n_x, it is the infinite series:\n\n1 - r - r² + r³ + r⁴ - r^5 - r^6 + r^7 + r^8 - ... \n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate would have its own series.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can express it as a power series and find a closed-form expression. Let me try.\n\nLet me denote S_x = 1 - r - r² + r³ + r⁴ - r^5 - r^6 + r^7 + r^8 - ... \n\nNotice that the pattern of signs repeats every four terms: -, -, +, +, -, -, +, +,...\n\nThis can be represented as grouping terms in pairs:\n\nGroup 1: - r - r²  \nGroup 2: + r³ + r⁴  \nGroup 3: - r^5 - r^6  \nGroup 4: + r^7 + r^8  \n... etc.\n\nSo S_x = 1 + Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k (r^{2k - 1} + r^{2k})  \nWait, for k starting at 1:\n\nWhen k=1: - (r^1 + r^2)  \nk=2: + (r^3 + r^4)  \nk=3: - (r^5 + r^6)  \n... \n\nSo S_x = 1 + Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k (r^{2k - 1} + r^{2k})  \n= 1 + Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k r^{2k - 1} (1 + r)  \nFactor out (1 + r):\n\nS_x = 1 + (1 + r) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k r^{2k - 1}  \n= 1 + (1 + r) r^{-1} Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k r^{2k}  \n= 1 + ( (1 + r)/r ) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k (r²)^k  \nThe sum Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k (r²)^k is a geometric series with first term -r² and ratio -r²:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ (-r²)^k = (-r²) / (1 + r²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nS_x = 1 + ( (1 + r)/r ) * [ (-r²) / (1 + r²) ) ]  \n= 1 - ( (1 + r)/r ) * ( r² / (1 + r²) )  \n= 1 - ( (1 + r) r / (1 + r²) )  \n= [ (1 + r²) - r(1 + r) ] / (1 + r²)  \nExpand numerator:\n\n1 + r² - r - r² = 1 - r\n\nTherefore, S_x = (1 - r)/(1 + r²)\n\nWhich matches the x-coordinate of B we found earlier! Similarly, if we do the same analysis for the y-coordinate of B, we would get r(1 - r)/(1 + r²). Therefore, confirming that the coordinates of B are indeed ((1 - r)/(1 + r²), r(1 - r)/(1 + r²)), and hence the distance is (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²). Therefore, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, plugging in r = 11/60:\n\nDistance = (1 - 11/60)/sqrt(1 + (11/60)^2) = (49/60)/sqrt(1 + 121/3600) = (49/60)/sqrt(3721/3600) = (49/60)/(61/60) = 49/61.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 49 + 61 = 110.\n\nBut to be 100% sure, let me check if there's an alternative interpretation of the problem where the answer might be different. For example, maybe the rotation is not of the displacement vector but something else? Or maybe my assumption that B is the limit of centers is wrong? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of another approach. Suppose we model the position of B as a point that is obtained by successive rotations and scalings. Since each step involves moving a certain distance and turning 90 degrees, similar to a geometric series in the complex plane.\n\nEarlier, we did this and found B = (1 - r)/(1 - i r). Then |B| = (1 - r)/sqrt(1 + r²). So same result. Therefore, seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a complex geometric series. The total displacement from O₀ to B is the sum we did earlier. Therefore, I think this is solid.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 49/61, so m + n is 110.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{110}\n</think>"}
