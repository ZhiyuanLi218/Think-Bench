Then express that area as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. Alright, let me start by understanding what the floor functions here mean.\n\nFirst, let's recall that floor(z) is the greatest integer less than or equal to z. So for example, if z is 2.3, floor(z) is 2. If z is exactly an integer, like 3, then floor(z) is 3. So, the problem says that floor(log₂(1/x)) is even and floor(log₅(1/y)) is even. \n\nLet me first analyze the x part. Let's consider floor(log₂(1/x)) being even. Let me denote that as k, which is even. So floor(log₂(1/x)) = k, where k is an even integer. Similarly for y, floor(log₅(1/y)) = m, where m is an even integer.\n\nLet me first work on the x side. Let me think about how log₂(1/x) relates to x. Since 0 < x ≤ 1, 1/x is ≥ 1. Therefore, log₂(1/x) is ≥ 0. So log₂(1/x) is a non-negative real number. The floor of that is an integer k ≥ 0. And we want k to be even.\n\nSimilarly for y. Let me first handle the x part. Let me write down what floor(log₂(1/x)) = k implies for x. Let me recall that if floor(z) = k, then k ≤ z < k + 1. So substituting z = log₂(1/x), we get k ≤ log₂(1/x) < k + 1. Let me solve for x here.\n\nFirst, exponentiating all parts with base 2. Remember that log₂(a) = b is equivalent to a = 2^b. So if k ≤ log₂(1/x) < k + 1, then 2^k ≤ 1/x < 2^{k + 1}. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because we're taking reciprocals of positive numbers), we get 1/(2^{k + 1}) < x ≤ 1/(2^k). Therefore, for each integer k ≥ 0, the values of x in the interval (1/(2^{k + 1}), 1/(2^k)] satisfy floor(log₂(1/x)) = k.\n\nSimilarly for y. Let me check that again. If floor(log₂(1/x)) = k, then x is in (1/(2^{k + 1}), 1/(2^k)]. So for each even k, we can take the union of all such intervals for even k, and the total length of those intervals will be the measure for x. Similarly for y with log base 5.\n\nTherefore, the set S is the union over all even integers k and m of the rectangles (1/(2^{k + 1}), 1/(2^k)] × (1/(5^{m + 1}), 1/(5^m)]. Wait, no, hold on. For y, it's log base 5. Let me check that again.\n\nFor y: floor(log₅(1/y)) = m. Let me do the same steps. If floor(log₅(1/y)) = m, then m ≤ log₅(1/y) < m + 1. Then exponentiating with base 5: 5^m ≤ 1/y < 5^{m + 1}. Taking reciprocals again: 1/(5^{m + 1}) < y ≤ 1/(5^m). Therefore, similar to x. So for each even m, y is in (1/(5^{m + 1}), 1/(5^m)].\n\nTherefore, the set S is the union over all even integers k ≥ 0 and even integers m ≥ 0 of the rectangles (1/(2^{k + 1}), 1/(2^k)] × (1/(5^{m + 1}), 1/(5^m)]. The area of S would then be the sum over all even k of the length of the x-interval times the sum over all even m of the length of the y-interval. Since the x and y parts are independent, the total area is the product of the two sums.\n\nTherefore, I can compute the total area by first computing the measure for x (sum over even k of [1/(2^k) - 1/(2^{k + 1})]) and similarly for y (sum over even m of [1/(5^m) - 1/(5^{m + 1})]), then multiply them together.\n\nLet me compute the x part first. Let me note that for each k, the length of the interval (1/(2^{k + 1}), 1/(2^k)] is 1/(2^k) - 1/(2^{k + 1}) = 1/(2^{k + 1}).\n\nWait, because 1/(2^k) - 1/(2^{k + 1}) = (2 - 1)/2^{k + 1} = 1/2^{k + 1}. So each interval for x contributes 1/2^{k + 1} to the total length, where k is even. Therefore, the total length for x is the sum over even k ≥ 0 of 1/2^{k + 1}.\n\nSimilarly for y, the length of each interval is 1/(5^m) - 1/(5^{m + 1}) = (5 - 1)/5^{m + 1} = 4/5^{m + 1}. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait 1/(5^m) - 1/(5^{m + 1}) = 1/(5^m) - 1/(5*5^m) = (1 - 1/5)/5^m = (4/5)/5^m = 4/(5^{m + 1}). Yes, that's correct. So for each even m, the length is 4/(5^{m + 1}).\n\nTherefore, the total measure for x is sum_{k even ≥ 0} 1/(2^{k + 1}), and for y it's sum_{m even ≥ 0} 4/(5^{m + 1}).\n\nTherefore, the area of S is [sum_{k even ≥ 0} 1/(2^{k + 1})] * [sum_{m even ≥ 0} 4/(5^{m + 1})].\n\nNow I need to compute these two sums. Let me start with the x sum. Let me denote k as even integers. Let me write k = 2n where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...). Similarly for m.\n\nTherefore, substituting k = 2n, the x sum becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/(2^{2n + 1}) = (1/2) * sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/(4^n) = (1/2) * [1 / (1 - 1/4)] by the formula for a geometric series. Since sum_{n=0}^∞ r^n = 1/(1 - r) for |r| < 1. Here, r = 1/4, so sum is 1/(1 - 1/4) = 4/3. Therefore, the x sum is (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nOriginal x sum: sum_{k even} 1/(2^{k + 1}).\n\nLet me list the terms:\n\nFor k = 0: 1/(2^{0 + 1}) = 1/2\n\nk = 2: 1/(2^{2 + 1}) = 1/8\n\nk = 4: 1/(2^5) = 1/32\n\nk = 6: 1/(2^7) = 1/128\n\n...\n\nSo the sum is 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/128 + ... which is a geometric series with first term a = 1/2 and common ratio r = 1/4. Because each term is (1/4) times the previous term: 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8, 1/8 * 1/4 = 1/32, etc. Therefore, the sum is a / (1 - r) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3. Correct. So that's the x part: 2/3.\n\nNow for the y part: sum_{m even ≥ 0} 4/(5^{m + 1}).\n\nSimilarly, let me substitute m = 2n where n ≥ 0. Therefore, substituting m = 2n:\n\nsum_{n=0}^∞ 4 / (5^{2n + 1}) = (4/5) * sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/(25^n) = (4/5) * [1 / (1 - 1/25)] = (4/5) * [25/24] = (4/5)*(25/24) = (4*25)/(5*24) = (100)/120 = 5/6.\n\nWait let me check:\n\nOriginal sum is 4/(5^{m + 1}) for m even. Let me write m = 0, 2, 4,...\n\nFor m = 0: 4/(5^{0 + 1}) = 4/5\n\nm = 2: 4/(5^{2 + 1}) = 4/125\n\nm = 4: 4/(5^5) = 4/3125\n\n...\n\nSo the terms are 4/5 + 4/125 + 4/3125 + ... which is 4/5 * [1 + 1/25 + 1/25^2 + ...]. The series inside the brackets is a geometric series with a = 1, r = 1/25. Therefore, the sum is 1/(1 - 1/25) = 25/24. Therefore, total sum is (4/5)*(25/24) = (4*25)/(5*24) = (100)/120 = 5/6. Correct. Therefore, the y sum is 5/6.\n\nTherefore, the total area is (2/3) * (5/6) = 10/18 = 5/9. Wait, but 2/3 times 5/6 is (2*5)/(3*6) = 10/18 = 5/9. So 5/9. However, let me check if this is correct. Wait, but before I accept that, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that both floor(log₂(1/x)) and floor(log₅(1/y)) are even. So we have considered all even k and even m, and took the product of the measures. But is there any overlap or something? No, because the intervals for different k are disjoint, same for m, so the total measure is indeed the product of the two sums. So 2/3 * 5/6 = 5/9. Therefore, the area is 5/9, so m = 5, n = 9, m + n = 14. But wait, hold on. Wait 5 and 9 are coprime? Yes, since gcd(5,9)=1. Therefore, the answer is 5 + 9 = 14. However, wait, let me check again because sometimes there can be a mistake in the sums.\n\nWait let me check again the x sum. The x sum is over even k of 1/(2^{k + 1}).\n\nBut k is even, starting at 0. For k=0, 1/(2^{1}) = 1/2. For k=2, 1/(2^{3})=1/8. For k=4, 1/(2^5)=1/32, etc. So the sum is 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + ... which is a geometric series with first term 1/2 and ratio 1/4. So sum is (1/2)/(1 - 1/4) = (1/2)/(3/4) = 2/3. Correct. Similarly for y: sum is 4/5 + 4/5^3 + 4/5^5 + ... which is 4/5 * [1 + 1/25 + 1/25^2 + ...] = 4/5 * [1 / (1 - 1/25)] = 4/5 * 25/24 = 5/6. Correct. So 2/3 * 5/6 = 10/18 = 5/9. Therefore, the area is 5/9. Therefore, m + n is 5 + 9 = 14. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait the problem says \"the area of the graph of S\". Is there a possibility that I missed something? Let me think again. The set S is defined by 0 < x ≤ 1, 0 < y ≤ 1, with those floor conditions. The way I approached it was by considering that for each x in those intervals, and similarly for y, so the total area is the product of the measures. Since x and y are independent, that should be correct.\n\nBut let me check with specific intervals. For example, take k=0 (even). Then x is in (1/2^{1}, 1/2^0] = (1/2, 1]. The length here is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Then k=2: (1/2^{3}, 1/2^2] = (1/8, 1/4]. Length is 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8. Similarly for k=4: (1/32, 1/16], length 1/16 - 1/32 = 1/32. So adding up these lengths: 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + ... which is 2/3 as before. Similarly for y. So seems okay.\n\nBut let me check for y. For m=0: (1/5^{1}, 1/5^0] = (1/5, 1]. Length is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. For m=2: (1/5^3, 1/5^2] = (1/125, 1/25]. Length is 1/25 - 1/125 = 4/125. Then m=4: (1/5^5, 1/5^4] = (1/3125, 1/625], length is 1/625 - 1/3125 = 4/3125. So adding up: 4/5 + 4/125 + 4/3125 + ... which is 4/5 * [1 + 1/25 + 1/25^2 + ...] = 4/5 * 1/(1 - 1/25) = 4/5 * 25/24 = 5/6. Correct. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying 2/3 and 5/6 gives 5/9. Therefore, the answer should be 5 + 9 = 14. However, I remember that sometimes floor functions can have edge cases where the endpoints are included or excluded, but since we are dealing with intervals where the left end is excluded and the right end is included, and since the total area is a measure, which doesn't care about single points (they have measure zero), so even if there was some overlap at the endpoints, it wouldn't affect the area. So I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, 5/9, m + n is 14. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the floor function. Let me take an example. For x in (1/2, 1], floor(log₂(1/x)) is floor(log₂(1/x)). Let me take x = 1/2, then 1/x = 2, log₂(2) = 1, floor(1) = 1, which is odd. But our interval is (1/2, 1], so x=1/2 is excluded. So for x approaching 1/2 from the right, 1/x approaches 2 from above, so log₂(1/x) approaches 1 from above? Wait no, if x approaches 1/2 from the right, then 1/x approaches 2 from below. For example, x = 1/2 + ε, so 1/x ≈ 2 - 2ε. Therefore, log₂(1/x) approaches log₂(2) = 1 from below. Therefore, floor(log₂(1/x)) would be 0 when it's less than 1? Wait no. Wait if log₂(1/x) is approaching 1 from below, then floor(log₂(1/x)) is 0? Wait no. Wait if log₂(1/x) is between 0 and 1, floor would be 0. Wait when is log₂(1/x) between 0 and 1? When 1/x is between 1 and 2, which is when x is between 1/2 and 1. Therefore, floor(log₂(1/x)) is 0 when x is in (1/2, 1]. Wait 0 is even! So that is included. Therefore, k=0 is even, so that interval is included. Similarly, for x in (1/8, 1/4], 1/x is in [4, 8). Therefore, log₂(1/x) is in [2, 3). Therefore floor(log₂(1/x)) = 2, which is even. Correct. Then x in (1/32, 1/16], 1/x is in [16, 32), log₂(1/x) is in [4, 5), floor is 4, even. So yes, the intervals are correct. Similarly for odd k, they would be excluded.\n\nSimilarly for y. For example, m=0: y in (1/5, 1], 1/y in [1, 5), log₅(1/y) in [0, 1), floor is 0, even. For m=2: y in (1/125, 1/25], 1/y in [25, 125), log₅(1/y) in [2, 3), floor is 2, even. Correct. So the intervals are correct. Therefore, the measure calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the area is indeed 2/3 * 5/6 = 5/9. So m + n = 5 + 9 = 14. Therefore, the answer is 14. But wait, hold on. Wait let me check once again with another approach. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming independence?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the x part as follows: For x in (0, 1], floor(log₂(1/x)) is even. Let me think of the intervals where k is even. So the total measure is sum_{n ≥ 0} [1/(2^{2n}) - 1/(2^{2n + 1})] ?\n\nWait no, earlier we had that for each even k, the interval is (1/(2^{k + 1}), 1/(2^k)] with length 1/(2^{k + 1}). Which when k is even, say k=2n, gives length 1/(2^{2n + 1}), and sum over n ≥ 0. Which is what we did. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire interval (0, 1] partitioned into intervals where floor(log₂(1/x)) is constant. For each integer k ≥ 0, the interval (1/(2^{k + 1}), 1/(2^k)] corresponds to floor(log₂(1/x)) = k. Therefore, the measure where floor(log₂(1/x)) is even is the sum over even k of the lengths of those intervals, which is sum_{n ≥ 0} [1/(2^{2n}) - 1/(2^{2n + 1})] ?\n\nWait, no, because the length of (1/(2^{k + 1}), 1/(2^k)] is 1/(2^k) - 1/(2^{k + 1}) = 1/(2^{k + 1}), which is the same as before. So for k = 2n, the length is 1/(2^{2n + 1}), so sum_{n ≥ 0} 1/(2^{2n + 1}) = 1/2 * sum_{n ≥ 0} 1/(4^n) = 1/2 * 4/3 = 2/3. Same result. So that's correct. Therefore, same for y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the measure for x as follows. Let me note that floor(log₂(1/x)) is even if and only if x is in (1/(2^{2m + 1}), 1/(2^{2m})] for some integer m ≥ 0. Therefore, the total length is sum_{m ≥ 0} [1/(2^{2m}) - 1/(2^{2m + 1})] = sum_{m ≥ 0} 1/(2^{2m + 1}) = same as before. Which is 2/3. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think recursively. Let me denote A as the measure of x in (0, 1] where floor(log₂(1/x)) is even. Let me try to write an equation for A. Let me note that for x in (0, 1/2], 1/x ≥ 2, so log₂(1/x) ≥ 1. Let me make a substitution: let x' = 1/x. But maybe not helpful. Alternatively, notice that the intervals where floor(log₂(1/x)) is even can be considered recursively. For example, when x is in (1/2, 1], floor(log₂(1/x)) = 0, which is even. Then for x in (1/4, 1/2], floor(log₂(1/x)) = 1, which is odd, excluded. For x in (1/8, 1/4], floor(log₂(1/x)) = 2, even, included. For x in (1/16, 1/8], floor(log₂(1/x)) = 3, odd, excluded. Etc. So the measure A is the sum of the lengths of (1/2, 1], (1/8, 1/4], (1/32, 1/16], etc. So A = (1 - 1/2) + (1/4 - 1/8) + (1/16 - 1/32) + ... = 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + ... which is same as before. So again, 2/3. Therefore, same result. Therefore, confident that x part is 2/3.\n\nSame for y. Let me think for y. Let me denote B as the measure for y. For y in (1/5, 1], floor(log₅(1/y)) = 0, even. For y in (1/25, 1/5], floor(log₅(1/y)) = 1, odd, excluded. For y in (1/125, 1/25], floor(log₅(1/y)) = 2, even, included. For y in (1/625, 1/125], floor(log₅(1/y)) = 3, odd, excluded. Etc. Therefore, measure B is (1 - 1/5) + (1/25 - 1/125) + (1/625 - 1/3125) + ... = 4/5 + 4/125 + 4/3125 + ... which is same as before, 5/6. Therefore, same result. Therefore, the total area is 2/3 * 5/6 = 5/9. So answer is 5 + 9 = 14. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check with specific numbers. Let me compute partial sums for x and y.\n\nFor x sum: first term is 1/2. Second term adds 1/8, total 5/8 = 0.625. Third term adds 1/32, total 5/8 + 1/32 = 21/32 ≈ 0.65625. Fourth term adds 1/128, total ≈ 0.65625 + 0.0078125 = 0.6640625. The limit is 2/3 ≈ 0.6666..., so yes, approaching that.\n\nFor the y sum: first term is 4/5 = 0.8. Second term adds 4/125 = 0.032, total 0.832. Third term adds 4/3125 ≈ 0.00128, total ≈ 0.83328. Fourth term adds 4/(5^7) ≈ 4/78125 ≈ 0.0000512, total ≈ 0.8333312. Which approaches 5/6 ≈ 0.833333..., so correct. Therefore, multiplying 0.666... * 0.8333... equals (2/3)*(5/6) = 10/18 = 5/9 ≈ 0.5555...\n\nSo seems correct. Therefore, I think the answer is 14.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a possibility that when k or m is zero, there is some issue. For example, floor(log₂(1/x)) = 0 when x ∈ (1/2, 1]. Similarly floor(log₅(1/y)) = 0 when y ∈ (1/5, 1]. So the region (1/2, 1] × (1/5, 1] is included in S. The area of that is (1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/5) = (1/2)*(4/5) = 2/5. Then adding the next regions: for x in (1/8, 1/4] and y in (1/125, 1/25], etc. But since we already did the infinite sum, and the partial sums approach 5/9 ≈ 0.5555, which is bigger than 2/5 = 0.4, that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute 2/3 * 5/6 = 5/9 ≈ 0.5555. Let me check with the first term of x and first term of y: (1/2)*(4/5) = 2/5 = 0.4. Then adding the next terms: for x next term is 1/8, and for y next term is 4/125, so area contribution is 1/8 * 4/125 = 4/(1000) = 0.004. Then next term for x is 1/32 and for y is 4/3125, so 1/32 * 4/3125 = 4/(100000) = 0.00004. So total area so far is approx 0.4 + 0.004 + 0.00004 ≈ 0.40404. Then higher terms contribute even less. But according to our previous calculation, the total area is 5/9 ≈ 0.5555. Therefore, there must be more contributions. Wait, no! Wait, no, because the total area is the product of the two sums. So if I take the partial sums for x and partial sums for y and multiply them, I get an approximation. For example, if I take the first term of x sum (1/2) and first term of y sum (4/5), their product is 2/5. If I take the first two terms of x sum (1/2 + 1/8 = 5/8) and first two terms of y sum (4/5 + 4/125 = 104/125), then the product is (5/8)*(104/125) = (520)/1000 = 0.52. Then taking more terms: x sum up to third term is 21/32 ≈ 0.65625, y sum up to third term is ≈ 0.83328. Their product is ≈ 0.65625 * 0.83328 ≈ 0.547. Which is approaching 0.5555. So yes, seems plausible. Therefore, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5/9, so m + n = 5 + 9 = 14. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{14}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{14}\n</think>"}
