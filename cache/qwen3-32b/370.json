Each can be inscribed in a circle with radius 1. The problem gives me the sine of the acute angles between the diagonals for each quadrilateral: sinφ_A = 2/3, sinφ_B = 3/5, and sinφ_C = 6/7. All three quadrilaterals have the same area K, and I need to find K in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. A cyclic quadrilateral is one where all four vertices lie on a circle. For such quadrilaterals, there are several formulas related to their area, sides, angles, and diagonals. One important formula is Brahmagupta's formula, which gives the area of a cyclic quadrilateral in terms of its sides. However, since the problem mentions the angle between the diagonals and relates it to the area, maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the area of a quadrilateral in terms of its diagonals and the angle between them. For any quadrilateral, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*d1*d2*sinθ, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals and θ is the angle between them. However, this formula is for any quadrilateral, not necessarily cyclic. But in this problem, we are told that all three quadrilaterals have the same area K. Also, each is cyclic and inscribed in a circle of radius 1. So maybe I can use both Brahmagupta's formula and this other formula to relate the sides, diagonals, and angles?\n\nBut since the problem gives me sinφ for each quadrilateral, where φ is the acute angle between the diagonals, perhaps I can use the formula K = (1/2)*d1*d2*sinφ. However, since each quadrilateral is cyclic, there might be relations between the diagonals and the sides. Also, since they are cyclic quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle of radius 1, the sides can be related to the central angles subtended by them.\n\nLet me think. For a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d, inscribed in a circle of radius R, each side can be expressed as 2R*sin(α/2), where α is the central angle corresponding to that side. Wait, is that correct?\n\nActually, the length of a chord in a circle is given by chord length = 2R*sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle subtended by the chord. So yes, if I have a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d, then each side corresponds to a central angle, say θ_a, θ_b, θ_c, θ_d, such that a = 2R*sin(θ_a/2), etc. Since R is 1, the radius is 1, so a = 2*sin(θ_a/2), and similarly for the other sides.\n\nMoreover, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the sum of opposite central angles should be 2π? Wait, no. Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is π radians. But central angles are different. Wait, maybe I need to relate the central angles to the inscribed angles?\n\nLet me recall that in a circle, the central angle subtended by an arc is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. So, for example, if in the cyclic quadrilateral, one of the internal angles is θ, then the central angle subtended by the corresponding arc would be 2θ. But since in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to π, so if we have angles α and γ opposite each other, then α + γ = π. Therefore, their corresponding central angles would be 2α and 2γ, which would sum to 2π. Therefore, the sum of opposite central angles is 2π. Therefore, for the four central angles θ_a, θ_b, θ_c, θ_d, we have θ_a + θ_c = 2π and θ_b + θ_d = 2π. Therefore, θ_a + θ_b + θ_c + θ_d = 4π, which makes sense because they cover the whole circle.\n\nTherefore, the sides of the cyclic quadrilateral are determined by four central angles θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, with θ1 + θ3 = 2π and θ2 + θ4 = 2π. So, if we fix θ1, θ2, then θ3 = 2π - θ1 and θ4 = 2π - θ2. Therefore, the four sides can be written as:\n\na = 2 sin(θ1/2)\n\nb = 2 sin(θ2/2)\n\nc = 2 sin(θ3/2) = 2 sin(π - θ1/2) = 2 sin(θ1/2) ?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, θ3 is 2π - θ1. Therefore, θ3/2 is π - θ1/2. Then sin(θ3/2) = sin(π - θ1/2) = sin(θ1/2). Therefore, c = 2 sin(θ1/2) = a. Similarly, d = 2 sin(θ4/2) = 2 sin(π - θ2/2) = 2 sin(θ2/2) = b. Therefore, the sides would be a, b, a, b? But that would make the quadrilateral a kite? But the problem says that David found four sticks of different lengths. Therefore, this suggests that my reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, if θ3 = 2π - θ1, then θ3/2 = π - θ1/2, so sin(θ3/2) = sin(θ1/2). Therefore, the side opposite to side a is also a? But that would mean that the quadrilateral has two pairs of equal sides. However, the problem says that David found four sticks of different lengths. Therefore, there must be something wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake is in assuming that θ_a is the central angle corresponding to side a? Let me check again.\n\nIn a cyclic quadrilateral, each side corresponds to a chord of the circle. The central angle for that chord can be calculated based on the chord length. However, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the internal angles are related to the arcs. Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the internal angle at a vertex is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to that angle.\n\nWait, suppose we have a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD. The internal angle at vertex A is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it, which is arc BCD. Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact relationship.\n\nActually, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In a cyclic quadrilateral, each internal angle intercepts an arc opposite to it. For example, angle A intercepts arc BCD, which is the arc from B to D passing through C. However, since the total circumference is 2π, the measure of angle A is half the measure of arc BCD, which is equal to half of (2π - arc BAD). Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to π, if angle A + angle C = π, then their intercepted arcs must sum to 2π. Each angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc, so angle A intercepts arc BCD, angle C intercepts arc BAD. Therefore, measure of arc BCD is 2*angle A, measure of arc BAD is 2*angle C. Therefore, 2*angle A + 2*angle C = measure of arc BCD + measure of arc BAD = measure of the whole circle = 2π. Therefore, angle A + angle C = π, which matches the cyclic quadrilateral property. Therefore, the central angles corresponding to arcs BC and CD and DA?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me denote the arcs subtended by the sides. Let me denote the arcs between the vertices. Let me say that between points A and B, there is an arc of measure α, between B and C an arc of measure β, between C and D an arc of measure γ, and between D and A an arc of measure δ. Then, since the total circumference is 2π, we have α + β + γ + δ = 2π.\n\nIn this case, the internal angle at vertex A is half the measure of the arc opposite to it, which is arc BCD, which is β + γ. Therefore, angle A = (β + γ)/2. Similarly, angle B intercepts arc CDA = γ + δ, so angle B = (γ + δ)/2. Similarly, angle C = (δ + α)/2, angle D = (α + β)/2. Since opposite angles sum to π, angle A + angle C = [(β + γ)/2 + (δ + α)/2] = (α + β + γ + δ)/2 = 2π / 2 = π, which checks out. Similarly for angle B + angle D.\n\nNow, the sides of the quadrilateral can be related to their subtended arcs. The length of side AB is the chord subtending arc α, so AB = 2R sin(α/2). Similarly, BC = 2R sin(β/2), CD = 2R sin(γ/2), DA = 2R sin(δ/2). Since R = 1, AB = 2 sin(α/2), etc.\n\nTherefore, the four sides of the quadrilateral are determined by the four arcs α, β, γ, δ, which satisfy α + β + γ + δ = 2π. Also, since the problem says that David found four sticks of different lengths, that implies that all four arcs α, β, γ, δ are such that their corresponding chord lengths are different. So, for example, if two arcs are equal, their chord lengths would be equal, but since all four sticks are different, all four arcs must be different? Or maybe not necessarily? For example, arcs could be different but still result in same chord lengths? Wait, chord length depends on the arc measure. Since chord length is 2 sin(θ/2), where θ is the arc measure. Since sin is injective on [0, π], chord lengths will be unique if the arcs are in (0, π). However, arcs in a quadrilateral can be larger than π? Wait, arcs between two points on a circle can be measured in two ways, the minor arc and the major arc. However, in the context of a cyclic quadrilateral, the arcs we are considering are the ones that are intercepted by the sides, so they should be less than π? Or not necessarily?\n\nWait, if you have a cyclic quadrilateral, each side subtends an arc. If the quadrilateral is convex, then each arc should be less than π. Because if an arc were greater than π, the corresponding chord would be on the other side of the circle, making the quadrilateral concave. Therefore, since the quadrilaterals are convex, each arc α, β, γ, δ must be between 0 and π. Therefore, since chord lengths are 2 sin(arc/2), and arcs are between 0 and π, then arc/2 is between 0 and π/2, so sin(arc/2) is injective. Therefore, different arcs will correspond to different chord lengths. Therefore, since all four sticks are of different lengths, all four arcs α, β, γ, δ must be distinct.\n\nTherefore, each quadrilateral A, B, C has four distinct sides, determined by four arcs α, β, γ, δ adding up to 2π. Now, the problem says that there are three different quadrilaterals A, B, C, each with the same four sticks? Wait, no. Wait, David found four sticks of different lengths that can be used to form three non-congruent convex cyclic quadrilaterals. So, the same four sticks can be arranged in different ways to form different quadrilaterals. However, since cyclic quadrilaterals are determined up to rotation and reflection by their side lengths and the order of the sides. Therefore, different orderings of the sides can lead to different quadrilaterals. However, since the sticks are four different lengths, the different quadrilaterals must be different permutations of the sides.\n\nBut cyclic quadrilaterals can be formed by different orderings of the sides, but some permutations might lead to the same quadrilateral up to congruence. However, since they are non-congruent, they must be different in terms of their side orderings. For example, if you have sides a, b, c, d, then arranging them as a, b, c, d vs. a, c, b, d could lead to different quadrilaterals.\n\nHowever, since the problem mentions three non-congruent convex cyclic quadrilaterals, each with the same four sticks. Therefore, the same four sticks can be arranged in three different ways to form three different cyclic quadrilaterals. Each of these quadrilaterals has the same area K. Also, each has a specific angle φ between the diagonals with given sine values.\n\nSo, given that, perhaps we need to relate the angle between the diagonals to the arcs or sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the angle between the diagonals in a cyclic quadrilateral. Let me think. For a cyclic quadrilateral, there are relations between the sides, the diagonals, and the angles.\n\nAlternatively, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, we can use coordinates or complex numbers to model it, but that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use trigonometric identities and the law of sines or cosines in the circle.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals can be related to the sum of products of opposite sides? Wait, Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides: ac + bd = ef, where a, b, c, d are the sides and e, f the diagonals. However, since the problem involves the angle between the diagonals, maybe combining Ptolemy's theorem with the area formula?\n\nThe area K can be expressed as (1/2)*d1*d2*sinφ, where φ is the angle between the diagonals. Also, Brahmagupta's formula says that for a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d, the area is sqrt[(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)], where s is the semiperimeter. But since all three quadrilaterals have the same area K, perhaps we can set up equations?\n\nBut since the sides are the same for all three quadrilaterals, just arranged differently, the Brahmagupta's formula would give the same area regardless of the order of the sides. Wait, is that true? Wait, Brahmagupta's formula depends only on the lengths of the sides, not on their order. Therefore, if all three quadrilaterals have the same four sides, then they should all have the same area. However, the problem says that they have the same area K, so that is consistent. However, the problem says that they can be formed by four sticks of different lengths, so perhaps the same four sticks, arranged in different orders, forming different quadrilaterals, but since Brahmagupta's formula gives the same area regardless of order, they all have same area. Therefore, maybe the given information about sinφ_A, sinφ_B, sinφ_C is redundant? But no, the problem says that we need to find K, so maybe we need to use both Brahmagupta's formula and the formula involving the diagonals and angle between them. Since we have three different angles, but same area, we can set up equations to solve for the sides?\n\nBut since there are four sticks of different lengths, let me denote them as a, b, c, d. However, since the problem does not give us the lengths of the sticks, we need to find them? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find relations between the diagonals and the angle between them. Let me think. For each quadrilateral, we have:\n\nK = (1/2)*d1*d2*sinφ.\n\nBut also, by Ptolemy's theorem, for a cyclic quadrilateral, d1*d2 = ac + bd, where a, b, c, d are the sides? Wait, no, Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the opposite sides. So, if the sides are a, b, c, d in order, then Ptolemy's theorem says that d1*d2 = ac + bd. However, depending on the order of the sides in the quadrilateral, the products of opposite sides will change. Therefore, for different permutations of the sides, the value of d1*d2 will be different. Therefore, since each quadrilateral A, B, C has different permutations of the sides, their d1*d2 will be different, but since K is same, and sinφ is different, we can set up equations for each quadrilateral.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let me denote for quadrilateral A, suppose that the product of the diagonals is P_A, then K = (1/2)*P_A*(2/3). Similarly for quadrilateral B: K = (1/2)*P_B*(3/5). For quadrilateral C: K = (1/2)*P_C*(6/7). Therefore, we can write:\n\n(1/2)*P_A*(2/3) = (1/2)*P_B*(3/5) = (1/2)*P_C*(6/7) = K.\n\nTherefore, simplifying:\n\nP_A*(2/3) = P_B*(3/5) = P_C*(6/7) = 2K.\n\nTherefore, we can express P_A, P_B, P_C in terms of K:\n\nP_A = (2K) * (3/2) = 3K,\n\nP_B = (2K) * (5/3) = (10K)/3,\n\nP_C = (2K) * (7/6) = (7K)/3.\n\nTherefore, the products of the diagonals for each quadrilateral are 3K, (10/3)K, and (7/3)K respectively.\n\nBut also, each P_A, P_B, P_C is equal to the sum of the products of the opposite sides for that quadrilateral. However, since the sides are the same four sticks arranged differently, depending on the permutation, the products of opposite sides will differ.\n\nTherefore, if we can denote the four sticks as w, x, y, z (distinct lengths), then for each quadrilateral, depending on the order, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of products of opposite sides. For example, if quadrilateral A has sides in the order w, x, y, z, then P_A = wy + xz. If quadrilateral B has sides in a different order, say w, x, z, y, then P_B would be wz + xy. Similarly, quadrilateral C might have another permutation leading to a different product.\n\nTherefore, if we can figure out which permutations correspond to which P_A, P_B, P_C, we can set up equations.\n\nBut since there are three different products (3K, 10K/3, 7K/3), and four sticks, we need to find permutations of the four sticks such that the sum of products of opposite sides gives these three different values.\n\nHowever, since there are three quadrilaterals, each with different permutations, we need to figure out what those permutations are. But without knowing the specific permutations, how can we proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that for four numbers w, x, y, z, there are three different ways to pair them as products of opposite sides. Wait, for a quadrilateral, there are two pairs of opposite sides. However, depending on the order, different pairings occur. For example, if we fix the order of the sides as w, x, y, z, then the opposite sides are w and y, x and z. Therefore, the products are wy and xz. If we rearrange the sides as w, x, z, y, then the opposite sides are w and z, x and y, so products wz and xy. Another permutation could be w, y, x, z, which would have opposite sides w and x, y and z, products wx and yz. Wait, but that would be another product. Therefore, there are three different ways to pair the sides into two pairs of products: (wy + xz), (wz + xy), (wx + yz). Therefore, these three expressions correspond to the three different P_A, P_B, P_C.\n\nTherefore, if we denote S1 = wy + xz = 3K,\n\nS2 = wz + xy = 10K/3,\n\nS3 = wx + yz = 7K/3.\n\nTherefore, we have three equations:\n\n1) wy + xz = 3K,\n\n2) wz + xy = 10K/3,\n\n3) wx + yz = 7K/3.\n\nAdditionally, since Brahmagupta's formula gives the area K in terms of the sides. However, Brahmagupta's formula is K = sqrt[(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)], where s = (a + b + c + d)/2. However, since the sides are w, x, y, z, we can write:\n\nK = sqrt[(s - w)(s - x)(s - y)(s - z)].\n\nBut we don't know the values of w, x, y, z or s. However, perhaps we can find relations between w, x, y, z using the equations above?\n\nMoreover, since the quadrilaterals are cyclic and inscribed in a circle of radius 1, we can also relate the sides to the circle. As I thought earlier, each side is equal to 2 sin(arc/2), where arc is the central angle subtended by the side. Since the four arcs α, β, γ, δ add up to 2π, and each side is 2 sin(arc/2). Let me denote:\n\nLet me denote the sides as:\n\nw = 2 sin(α/2),\n\nx = 2 sin(β/2),\n\ny = 2 sin(γ/2),\n\nz = 2 sin(δ/2),\n\nwith α + β + γ + δ = 2π.\n\nMoreover, since the quadrilateral is convex, each arc is between 0 and π, so each sin(arc/2) is between 0 and 1, so each side is between 0 and 2.\n\nBut how does this help? Perhaps we can use some trigonometric identities?\n\nAlternatively, since we have four variables w, x, y, z and three equations from the products, and another equation from Brahmagupta's formula, but we need more relations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals can also be expressed in terms of the sides and the cosine of the angle between them? Wait, maybe using the law of cosines on the triangles formed by the diagonals?\n\nAlternatively, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, we can use the formula for the angle between the diagonals in terms of the sides.\n\nI found a formula here (but since I can't actually look it up, I need to derive it). Let me consider a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d. Let me denote the diagonals as e and f. The angle φ between the diagonals can be found using the formula involving the sides and the diagonals. Alternatively, using vector methods or coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since the area is also given by Brahmagupta's formula, and also by (1/2)*e*f*sinφ, so equating them:\n\nsqrt[(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)] = (1/2)*e*f*sinφ.\n\nBut we also have from Ptolemy's theorem e*f = ac + bd (depending on the pairing). Therefore, combining:\n\nsqrt[(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)] = (1/2)*(ac + bd)*sinφ.\n\nTherefore, sinφ = 2*sqrt[(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)] / (ac + bd).\n\nBut since we know sinφ for each quadrilateral, and since the area K is equal to sqrt[(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)], then:\n\nsinφ = 2K / (ac + bd).\n\nTherefore, for each quadrilateral:\n\nFor A: sinφ_A = 2K / P_A => 2/3 = 2K / P_A => P_A = 3K,\n\nSimilarly, for B: 3/5 = 2K / P_B => P_B = (10/3)K,\n\nFor C: 6/7 = 2K / P_C => P_C = (7/3)K,\n\nWhich is exactly what I had earlier. Therefore, this gives us the three equations for P_A, P_B, P_C.\n\nBut since we already have those equations, perhaps we need another approach. Since we also know that the sides are related to the circle of radius 1. Each side is 2 sin(arc/2). Also, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, there is a relation between the sides and the radius. However, since the radius is 1, perhaps we can use another formula?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that for any cyclic quadrilateral, there's a relation between the sides and the radius. However, I don't recall a direct formula, but maybe we can derive it.\n\nFor a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d and circumradius R, there is a formula that relates them. However, I don't remember it off the top of my head. Maybe I can derive it?\n\nAlternatively, consider that each side is a chord of the circle. Therefore, for each side, say a = 2R sin(α/2), where α is the central angle. Since R = 1, a = 2 sin(α/2). Similarly for other sides. Also, as before, α + γ = 2π and β + δ = 2π if we consider opposite arcs. Wait, earlier I had confusion about the sides, but now, if we consider that the sides correspond to arcs α, β, γ, δ with α + β + γ + δ = 2π, and angle between sides... Wait, but how does this relate to the sides?\n\nAlternatively, if we take all four arcs α, β, γ, δ, then we have:\n\na = 2 sin(α/2),\n\nb = 2 sin(β/2),\n\nc = 2 sin(γ/2),\n\nd = 2 sin(δ/2),\n\nand α + β + γ + δ = 2π.\n\nBut since α + γ = 2π - (β + δ)? Wait, no, α + β + γ + δ = 2π. So if we take opposite arcs... Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the internal angles are related to the arcs. However, maybe we can use some trigonometric identities here.\n\nLet me consider that if we have four arcs α, β, γ, δ adding to 2π. Let me suppose that γ = 2π - α - β - δ? No, since α + β + γ + δ = 2π. Wait, perhaps I need to find relations between the sides. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we have four variables (w, x, y, z) and three equations from the products S1, S2, S3, and another equation from Brahmagupta's formula. But we need more equations. However, we also have that each side is 2 sin(arc/2), and arcs add up to 2π. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assume specific variables. Let me denote w, x, y, z as the sides. Let me also note that since they are chords of a unit circle, each side is less than or equal to 2. Also, since they are four different lengths, they are four different numbers between 0 and 2.\n\nBut how can I proceed? Maybe I need to find w, x, y, z such that:\n\nwy + xz = 3K,\n\nwz + xy = 10K/3,\n\nwx + yz = 7K/3,\n\nand also Brahmagupta's formula:\n\nK^2 = (s - w)(s - x)(s - y)(s - z),\n\nwhere s = (w + x + y + z)/2.\n\nBut this seems like a system of equations with variables w, x, y, z, K. It's a lot of variables, but maybe we can find relations between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the three equations involving the products can be manipulated. Let me write them again:\n\n1) wy + xz = 3K,\n\n2) wz + xy = (10/3)K,\n\n3) wx + yz = (7/3)K.\n\nLet me consider subtracting equations to find relations between variables.\n\nFor example, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(wz + xy) - (wy + xz) = (10/3)K - 3K = (10/3 - 9/3)K = (1/3)K.\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nwz + xy - wy - xz = w(z - y) + x(y - z) = (w - x)(z - y) = - (x - w)(z - y).\n\nTherefore:\n\n(w - x)(y - z) = (1/3)K.\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n(wx + yz) - (wz + xy) = (7/3)K - (10/3)K = (-3/3)K = -K.\n\nLeft side:\n\nwx + yz - wz - xy = w(x - z) + y(z - x) = (w - y)(x - z).\n\nTherefore:\n\n(w - y)(x - z) = -K.\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(wx + yz) - (wy + xz) = (7/3)K - 3K = (7/3 - 9/3)K = (-2/3)K.\n\nLeft side:\n\nwx + yz - wy - xz = w(x - y) + z(y - x) = (w - z)(x - y).\n\nTherefore:\n\n(w - z)(x - y) = -2K/3.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\nA) (w - x)(y - z) = (1/3)K,\n\nB) (w - y)(x - z) = -K,\n\nC) (w - z)(x - y) = -2K/3.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can assign variables to differences. Let me denote:\n\nLet me let a = w - x,\n\nb = w - y,\n\nc = w - z,\n\nand so on, but this may not help directly. Alternatively, think of variables as differences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume some relations between variables. Let me think if there is a way to solve these equations. Let me note that equations A, B, C are multiplicative relations between differences of variables and K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of others. Let me consider equations A, B, C.\n\nLet me note that equations A, B, C can be considered as:\n\nLet me write:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation A: (w - x)(y - z) = K/3,\n\nEquation B: (w - y)(x - z) = -K,\n\nEquation C: (w - z)(x - y) = -2K/3.\n\nLet me try to find ratios between these equations.\n\nFor example, take equation B divided by equation A:\n\n[(w - y)(x - z)] / [(w - x)(y - z)] = (-K) / (K/3) = -3.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[(w - y)(x - z)] / [(w - x)(y - z)] = -3.\n\nLet me denote variables as follows:\n\nLet me let p = w - x,\n\nq = x - y,\n\nr = y - z,\n\ns = z - w,\n\nbut since they are differences, they might be related. Alternatively, express in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign variables to the differences. Let me consider:\n\nLet me let u = w - x,\n\nv = y - z,\n\nso equation A is u * v = K / 3.\n\nSimilarly, equation B: (w - y)(x - z) = -K.\n\nNote that w - y = (w - x) + (x - y) = u - q (if I let q = x - y),\n\nand x - z = (x - y) + (y - z) = q + v.\n\nTherefore, equation B becomes (u - q)(q + v) = -K.\n\nSimilarly, equation C: (w - z)(x - y) = -2K/3.\n\nw - z = (w - x) + (x - z) = u + q + v ?\n\nWait, w - z = (w - x) + (x - z) = u + (x - z). But x - z = (x - y) + (y - z) = q + v. Therefore, w - z = u + q + v.\n\nTherefore, equation C becomes (u + q + v) * q = -2K / 3.\n\nBut this seems getting complicated with introducing q. Perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we let variables as follows:\n\nLet me assume that w, x, y, z are four numbers such that we can assign them in terms of some parameters. However, without knowing more, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that equations A, B, C can be thought of as linear equations if we consider the products. However, they are multiplicative.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as w, x, y, z and try to express them in terms of K. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the three equations as a system that can be solved for the differences. For example, if we consider equations A, B, C as three equations with three unknowns (differences), but it's still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume specific values. For example, suppose that K is some rational number, and the sides are rational multiples? But since the sides are 2 sin(arc/2), which might not be rational, unless arcs are specific angles.\n\nAlternatively, think back to the fact that the sides are chords of the unit circle. Therefore, each side is 2 sin(arc/2). Therefore, if we denote the arcs as α, β, γ, δ, then:\n\nw = 2 sin(α/2),\n\nx = 2 sin(β/2),\n\ny = 2 sin(γ/2),\n\nz = 2 sin(δ/2),\n\nwith α + β + γ + δ = 2π.\n\nMoreover, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, we can use other relations. For example, in a cyclic quadrilateral, there is a relation between the sides and the radius, but I need to recall or derive it.\n\nAlternatively, since each side is a chord of the circle, we can use the formula for the circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral. There is a formula for the circumradius R of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d:\n\nR = sqrt[(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)] / [4K].\n\nSince R = 1, we have:\n\nsqrt[(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)] / [4K] = 1,\n\nso:\n\nsqrt[(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)] = 4K.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc) = 16K².\n\nBut from our earlier equations, we have:\n\nLet me note that:\n\nFor quadrilateral A, P_A = ab + cd = 3K,\n\nFor quadrilateral B, P_B = ac + bd = 10K/3,\n\nFor quadrilateral C, P_C = ad + bc = 7K/3.\n\nWait, hold on! If we consider that depending on the permutation of sides, the products ab + cd, ac + bd, ad + bc correspond to P_A, P_B, P_C. Therefore, if we take the three products:\n\n(ab + cd) = 3K,\n\n(ac + bd) = 10K/3,\n\n(ad + bc) = 7K/3.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the formula for R:\n\n(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc) = 3K * (10K/3) * (7K/3) = 3K * 10K/3 * 7K/3 = 10*7*K³ / 3 = 70K³ / 3.\n\nBut we also have from the formula that this product equals 16K². Therefore:\n\n70K³ / 3 = 16K².\n\nDivide both sides by K² (assuming K ≠ 0, which it isn't):\n\n70K / 3 = 16 => K = (16 * 3)/70 = 48/70 = 24/35.\n\nSimplify 24/35: 24 and 35 are coprime? 24 factors: 2^3 * 3; 35 is 5*7. Yes, they are coprime. Therefore, K = 24/35, so m = 24, n = 35, m + n = 59.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward! Did I miss something? Let me check again.\n\nSo, using the formula for the circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral:\n\nR = sqrt[(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)] / (4K).\n\nGiven R = 1, then:\n\n(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc) = 16K².\n\nBut we have from Ptolemy's theorem and the given angles:\n\n(ab + cd) = 3K,\n\n(ac + bd) = 10K/3,\n\n(ad + bc) = 7K/3.\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n(3K)(10K/3)(7K/3) = 3K * 10K/3 * 7K/3 = (3 * 10 * 7) / (3 * 3) * K³ = 70/3 * K³.\n\nSet equal to 16K²:\n\n70/3 * K³ = 16K² => 70/3 * K = 16 => K = 16 * 3 / 70 = 48/70 = 24/35. Yes, that's correct. And 24 and 35 are coprime, so m + n = 24 + 35 = 59.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 59.\n\nBut let me check if all steps are correct. First, I used the formula for the circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral. Let me verify that formula.\n\nYes, the formula for the circumradius R of a cyclic quadrilateral is given by:\n\nR = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{K^2}}.\n\nWait, let me check again. Wait, the formula I used was:\n\nR = sqrt[(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)] / (4K).\n\nBut let me check derivation. For a cyclic quadrilateral, there is a formula that relates R to the sides and the area.\n\nAnother way to derive it: For a cyclic quadrilateral, each side is 2R sin θ, where θ is half the central angle. Wait, earlier we had that each side is 2 sin(arc/2), since R = 1. So in general, for R, side a = 2R sin(α/2), etc. But combining this with other relations might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, there is a formula for the circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral:\n\nR = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{K^2}}}.\n\nWait, let me check with a reference (but since I can't, I need to verify).\n\nAlternatively, recall that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the following formula holds:\n\nK = \\frac{ef \\sin \\phi}{2},\n\nwhere e and f are the diagonals and φ the angle between them. Also, from Ptolemy: e*f = ac + bd (depending on the sides). But also, there are formulas connecting R with sides.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for R in terms of the sides and the area is:\n\nR = \\frac{\\sqrt{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}}{4K}\n\nYes, this formula is known. For example, from the formula for the circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral:\n\nR = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{K^2}}}.\n\nTherefore, squaring both sides:\n\nR² = \\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{16K²}.\n\nTherefore, since R = 1, we have:\n\n1 = \\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{16K²} => (ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc) = 16K².\n\nTherefore, my previous calculation is correct. Therefore, substituting the values:\n\n(ab + cd) = 3K,\n\n(ac + bd) = 10K/3,\n\n(ad + bc) = 7K/3,\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n3K * 10K/3 * 7K/3 = 70K³ / 3 = 16K² => 70K / 3 = 16 => K = 48/70 = 24/35. Yes.\n\nTherefore, K = 24/35, so m + n = 24 + 35 = 59.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 59. Let me check if there are any inconsistencies or missing steps.\n\nWe assumed that the three products (ab + cd), (ac + bd), (ad + bc) correspond to 3K, 10K/3, 7K/3. But how do we know which product corresponds to which? For example, is (ab + cd) necessarily 3K? But since we multiplied all three together, regardless of the order, the product would be same. Therefore, even if we permuted which product is which, multiplying them would still give same result. Therefore, regardless of the assignments, the equation would hold. Therefore, this approach is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 24/35, so 24 + 35 = 59. Seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{59}\n</think>"}
