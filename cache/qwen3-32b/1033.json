This represents a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to a nitrogen.\n- `N(C=O)O`: The nitrogen atom is bonded to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a single-bonded oxygen.\n\nThus, the structure is composed of:\n\n- 4 carbon atoms\n- 3 oxygen atoms (two in carbonyl groups and one in a hydroxyl group)\n- 2 nitrogen atoms (one in the branch and one in the main chain)\n- Several hydrogen atoms (implicitly present to satisfy valence rules)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nFrom the above parsing and valence considerations (ensuring each atom has a full valence), the molecular formula is:\n\n- **Carbon (C)**: 4 atoms\n- **Hydrogen (H)**: 8 atoms\n- **Oxygen (O)**: 3 atoms\n- **Nitrogen (N)**: 2 atoms\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C₄H₈O₃N₂**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Molar Mass\n\nUsing the following average atomic weights:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.011 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.007 g/mol\n\nNow calculate the molar mass:\n\n- Carbon: 4 × 12.011 = **48.044 g/mol**\n- Hydrogen: 8 × 1.008 = **8.064 g/mol**\n- Oxygen: 3 × 16.00 = **48.000 g/mol**\n- Nitrogen: 2 × 14.007 = **28.014 g/mol**\n\n**Total molar mass = 48.044 + 8.064 + 48.000 + 28.014 = 132.122 g/mol**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Match with the Given Options\n\nThe calculated molar mass is **132.122 g/mol**, which corresponds most closely to:\n\n**A: 132.120 g/mol**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n**A: 132.120 g/mol**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the molar weight of this molecule with the SMILES 'CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O'. Hmm, I remember that SMILES notation is a way to represent chemical structures as strings. So I need to parse this and figure out the atoms and their counts.\n\nStarting from the beginning: 'CC' means two carbon atoms connected together. Then there's a branch starting with 'C(=O)N'. The equals sign indicates a double bond, so that's a carbonyl group, C=O. Then attached to that carbon is a nitrogen, N. So that part is like a CON group. Then the next part is 'N(C=O)O'. Let me parse that. The nitrogen is connected to a carbonyl group again (C=O) and also to an oxygen? Wait, maybe the structure is a bit more complex. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe full SMILES is CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O. Let me visualize this. The main chain starts with two carbons. The second carbon (the one after the first C) has a branch. The branch is C(=O)N. So that carbon is connected to a carbonyl (C=O) and a nitrogen. Then the main chain continues with N(C=O)O. So the nitrogen is connected to another carbonyl group and an oxygen? Or maybe the oxygen is part of a hydroxyl group?\n\nWait, maybe I should draw this out. Let me think. The SMILES can be parsed as:\n\nC - C(=O)N - N(C=O)O\n\nWait, no. Let me parse the SMILES properly. The SMILES is: C C ( C ( = O ) N ) N ( C = O ) O\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first two Cs are connected in a chain: C-C.\n\n- The second C has a branch: (C(=O)N). So that carbon is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a nitrogen. So the second carbon has two bonds: one to the first C, one to the third C (the main chain), and then the branch with C=O and N?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's use the standard way to parse SMILES. Each atom and its branches are indicated by parentheses. So the main chain is C-C-N-O. But with branches?\n\nWait, the SMILES is CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O. Let me parse this as:\n\nThe main chain is C-C-N-O. But with branches on the second carbon and the nitrogen.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1 is connected to Carbon 2. Carbon 2 has a branch: C(=O)N. Then Carbon 2 is connected to a nitrogen (N) which has a branch: C=O and is connected to an O.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to count each atom:\n\n- The first C is just a methyl group? Wait, no. The SMILES is CC(...)... So the first two carbons are connected. The second carbon has a branch: C(=O)N. So that branch is a carbon connected to an oxygen double bond and a nitrogen. So that's a carbonyl group (C=O) and a nitrogen attached to the carbon. So the branch is a CON group. Then the main chain continues with N(C=O)O. So the nitrogen is connected to a carbonyl group and an oxygen. So that nitrogen has two substituents: a carbonyl and an oxygen? Wait, but oxygen is usually a single bond. Maybe it's an amide or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the nitrogen is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen with a single bond. But oxygen typically forms two bonds. If it's a hydroxyl group, that would be -OH. So maybe the structure is an amide with a hydroxyl group?\n\nWait, perhaps the molecule is something like 2-(carbamoyl)aminoacetic acid or similar. Let me try to count the atoms properly.\n\nLet me list all the atoms in the SMILES:\n\n- The first two Cs: 2 carbons.\n\n- The branch on the second carbon: C(=O)N. That's a carbon (which is connected to the second main carbon), a double bond to oxygen, and a single bond to nitrogen. So that's 1 carbon, 1 oxygen (double bond), 1 nitrogen.\n\nThen the main chain continues with N(C=O)O. The nitrogen here is connected to the main chain. The nitrogen has a branch of C=O (another carbonyl group) and is connected to an O. So that's another carbon (for the carbonyl), another oxygen (double bond), and another oxygen (single bond to nitrogen? But oxygen typically has two bonds. If it's a hydroxyl group, that would be -OH. So maybe that O is an -OH group. So that's another oxygen.\n\nSo total atoms:\n\nCarbons: 2 (from main chain) + 1 (from C(=O)N branch) + 1 (from N(C=O)O branch) = 4 carbons.\n\nOxygens: 1 (from C=O in branch) + 1 (from C=O in N branch) + 1 (from O in N(C=O)O) = 3 oxygens.\n\nNitrogens: 1 (from C(=O)N) + 1 (from N(C=O)O) = 2 nitrogens.\n\nHydrogens? Well, we need to consider valence. But for molar weight, we just need the counts of each atom.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some atoms. Let me check again.\n\nThe SMILES is CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main chain is C-C-N-O. But with branches.\n\nWait, the second carbon (the one after the first C) has a branch of C(=O)N. So that carbon is connected to the first C, the next N, and the branch.\n\nWait, the main chain is C-C-N-O? Or is it C-C connected to a branch, then connected to N which is connected to O?\n\nAlternatively, the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1 is connected to Carbon 2. Carbon 2 has a branch: C(=O)N. Then Carbon 2 is connected to a nitrogen (N) which has a branch: C=O and is connected to an O. So the nitrogen is connected to Carbon 2, a carbonyl group, and an oxygen.\n\nSo the atoms:\n\nCarbon 1: C\n\nCarbon 2: C (connected to C1, the branch C(=O)N, and the N in the main chain)\n\nBranch on Carbon 2: C(=O)N. So that's another carbon (C3), double bond to O (O1), and single bond to N1.\n\nThen the main chain from Carbon 2 goes to N (N1). N1 is connected to Carbon 2, and has a branch: C=O (C4 double bond to O2) and is connected to O3 (single bond).\n\nSo total atoms:\n\nCarbons: C1, C2, C3, C4 → 4 carbons.\n\nOxygens: O1 (from C=O in branch), O2 (from C=O in N's branch), O3 (single bonded to N) → 3 oxygens.\n\nNitrogens: N1 (connected to C3 and Carbon 2), and N2 (is there another N? Wait, no. The N in the branch is N1. Then the main N is N1 connected to O3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the SMILES is CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O. Let me parse each part:\n\n- The first two Cs: C-C.\n\n- The second C has a branch: (C(=O)N). So that branch is a carbon connected to a double-bonded O and a single-bonded N. So that's C(=O)N.\n\nThen the main chain continues with N(C=O)O. So the nitrogen is connected to the main chain (the second C) and has a branch of C=O and is connected to an O. So that N has two substituents: a carbonyl group and an oxygen.\n\nSo for the N(C=O)O part: the nitrogen is bonded to the main chain (the second C), a carbonyl group (C=O), and an oxygen. Wait, but nitrogen typically has three bonds. So if it's bonded to the main chain, a carbonyl group (which would be a single bond to a carbon with a double bond to O), and another oxygen. But how is that structured?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the N is part of an amide group. For example, if it's N connected to a carbonyl (like in an amide), and then another oxygen. But that might not make sense. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is like this: The second carbon (C2) is connected to a methyl group (C1), a branch (C(=O)N), and then to a nitrogen (N1). N1 is connected to C2, a carbonyl group (C=O), and an oxygen (O). But how is that possible? Nitrogen can have up to three bonds. So N1 is connected to C2, a carbonyl carbon (which is double bonded to O), and an oxygen. But the oxygen would need to have a single bond. So maybe it's an amide with a hydroxyl group? Like an amide and a hydroxyl on the same nitrogen?\n\nBut that might not be possible because the amide nitrogen is already bonded to two groups (the carbonyl and the main chain). Adding another oxygen would require another bond. Wait, maybe the oxygen is part of a hydroxyl group attached to the nitrogen. So the structure would be N-(carbonyl)-O-H. That would make sense. So the nitrogen has three bonds: to the main chain, to a carbonyl group, and to an -OH group. That's possible.\n\nIn that case, the atoms would be:\n\nCarbons: 4 (as before)\n\nOxygens: 3 (from the two carbonyls and one hydroxyl)\n\nNitrogens: 2 (the N in the first branch and the N in the main chain)\n\nHydrogens: Well, for molar weight, we don't need to count H explicitly, but we need to make sure the valence is correct. However, for the molar weight calculation, we just need the counts of each atom.\n\nSo total atoms:\n\nCarbon: 4\n\nOxygen: 3\n\nNitrogen: 2\n\nHydrogen: Let's see, but since we're calculating molar weight, maybe we don't need H's because the question is about the molar weight of the molecule as written, which includes all H's. Wait, but how do we know the number of H's? Because in SMILES, the H's are implicit unless specified. So we need to calculate the number of H's based on the valence of each atom.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Instead of trying to count all the atoms, maybe I can use a molecular formula approach.\n\nLet me try to derive the molecular formula from the SMILES.\n\nStarting with the SMILES: CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O\n\nLet's break it down into fragments:\n\n1. The first two carbons: C-C. So two carbons.\n\n2. The branch on the second carbon: C(=O)N. This is a carbon double bonded to oxygen and single bonded to nitrogen. So that's one carbon, one oxygen (double bond), one nitrogen.\n\n3. The main chain continues with N(C=O)O. The nitrogen is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen. Let's analyze this part.\n\nThe nitrogen here is bonded to the main chain (the second carbon), a carbonyl group (C=O), and an oxygen. So the nitrogen has three bonds: to the carbon, to the carbonyl carbon, and to the oxygen. The oxygen here is likely a hydroxyl group (OH), so that would be one oxygen with one bond to the nitrogen and one bond to hydrogen. But in the SMILES, it's written as O, which is just an oxygen atom. Since the SMILES doesn't include hydrogens explicitly, we need to infer the number of hydrogens based on valence.\n\nBut maybe instead of getting bogged down in the structure, I can use a systematic approach.\n\nLet me list all the atoms in the SMILES:\n\n- The SMILES is CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O.\n\nEach atom is represented by its symbol, with branches in parentheses.\n\nSo the atoms are:\n\n- C (first carbon)\n\n- C (second carbon)\n\n- C (from the branch C(=O)N)\n\n- O (from the =O in the branch)\n\n- N (from the branch)\n\n- N (from the N(C=O)O)\n\n- C (from the C=O in the N(C=O)O part)\n\n- O (from the =O in the N(C=O)O part)\n\n- O (from the O at the end)\n\nSo total atoms:\n\nCarbon: 1 (first C) + 1 (second C) + 1 (branch C) + 1 (C from C=O in N(C=O)O) = 4 carbons.\n\nOxygen: 1 (from branch =O) + 1 (from N(C=O)O's =O) + 1 (from the O at the end) = 3 oxygens.\n\nNitrogen: 1 (from branch) + 1 (from N in N(C=O)O) = 2 nitrogens.\n\nHydrogen: Not explicitly mentioned, but we need to calculate based on valence.\n\nNow, to find the molecular formula, we need to determine the number of each atom, including hydrogen. Let's calculate the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor each carbon, the number of hydrogens is determined by its valence. Carbon typically has four bonds. Let's go through each carbon:\n\n1. First carbon (C1): It's bonded to the second carbon (C2) and three hydrogens (since it's a methyl group). So 3 H.\n\n2. Second carbon (C2): It's bonded to C1, the branch carbon (C3), the nitrogen (N1), and possibly one hydrogen. Wait, C2 has four bonds. Let's see:\n\n- Bond to C1\n\n- Bond to C3 (branch)\n\n- Bond to N1 (main chain)\n\n- So that's three bonds. The fourth bond would be a hydrogen? Or is there another bond?\n\nWait, the SMILES is CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O. The second carbon (C2) has a branch (C(=O)N) and is connected to the nitrogen (N1). So C2 is connected to C1, the branch, and N1. That's three bonds. So the fourth bond would be a hydrogen. So C2 has one H.\n\n3. Branch carbon (C3): It's bonded to C2, a double bond to O (O1), and a single bond to N1. That's four bonds (single to C2, double to O1, single to N1). Wait, carbon can have four bonds. A double bond is two bonds. So C3 has one bond to C2, two bonds to O1, and one bond to N1. Total of four bonds. So no hydrogen here.\n\n4. The carbon in the C=O of N(C=O)O (let's call it C4): It's double bonded to O2 and single bonded to N2. That's three bonds. So it needs one more bond. Since it's in the C=O part, maybe it's a carbonyl carbon, which is double bonded to O2 and single bonded to N2. But that's three bonds. Wait, carbon usually has four bonds. So maybe it's bonded to N2 and has a double bond to O2, and one more bond? But in the SMILES, it's written as C=O, which is a carbonyl group. So C4 is double bonded to O2 and single bonded to N2. That's three bonds. Where's the fourth? Maybe there's a hydrogen? Or is there another bond?\n\nWait, the SMILES is N(C=O)O. The nitrogen (N2) is bonded to C2, the C=O (C4), and the O3. So N2 has three bonds: to C2, to C4, and to O3. That's three bonds, which is fine for nitrogen (it can have three bonds with a positive charge or with a lone pair). But the carbon in C=O (C4) is bonded to N2, double bonded to O2, and needs one more bond. Where is that? Maybe it's a hydrogen? Or is there another bond?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to calculate the molecular formula using the atoms we have and then adjust for hydrogen based on valence.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nMolecular formula so far (excluding hydrogen):\n\nC4H?O3N2\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of hydrogen atoms required for each atom to satisfy their valence.\n\nFor each carbon:\n\n- C1: bonded to C2 and three H → 3 H.\n\n- C2: bonded to C1, C3, N2, and one H → 1 H.\n\n- C3: bonded to C2, O1 (double bond), N1 → no H.\n\n- C4: bonded to N2, O2 (double bond), and one more bond. If it's a carbonyl carbon, it should have four bonds. But it's bonded to N2 and O2 (double bond). That's three bonds. Where is the fourth? Maybe it's bonded to another atom not mentioned? Or is there a hydrogen?\n\nWait, in the SMILES, the C=O is part of the N(C=O)O. So the C=O is a carbonyl group attached to the nitrogen. So the carbon is double bonded to O2 and single bonded to N2. That's three bonds. Where is the fourth? Maybe it's a hydrogen? Or is there another bond?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to think of possible structures. If the SMILES is N(C=O)O, then the nitrogen is connected to a carbonyl group and an oxygen. This could be an amide with a hydroxyl group, but that's not typical. Alternatively, it could be a hydroxylamine derivative, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is N-C(=O)-O, which would be a nitro group? No, nitro is NO2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the oxygen is part of a hydroxyl group attached to the nitrogen, and the nitrogen is part of an amide. So the structure would be N-(carbonyl)-OH. That's possible. In this case, the nitrogen has three bonds: to the main chain, to the carbonyl carbon, and to the hydroxyl group. The carbonyl carbon has four bonds: double to O, single to N, and one more bond. Where is that? Maybe there's a hydrogen? Or maybe it's bonded to another atom?\n\nWait, maybe the SMILES is written in a way that the C=O is part of the branch on the nitrogen. So the nitrogen has a branch of C=O and is connected to an O. So the nitrogen has two branches: one is C=O and one is O. But in SMILES, branches are indicated by parentheses. So N(C=O)O means the nitrogen has a branch of C=O and is connected to an O. So the nitrogen is bonded to the main chain, a carbonyl group (C=O), and an oxygen. But how is that possible? Nitrogen can have three bonds. So it's bonded to three groups: the main chain (carbon), the carbonyl group (carbon), and an oxygen. That's three bonds. The oxygen is likely a hydroxyl group (OH), so that's one bond to the oxygen and one to hydrogen. But in the SMILES, it's written as O, which is just an oxygen atom. So we need to account for the hydrogen.\n\nBut since the SMILES doesn't include hydrogens, we need to calculate them based on valence.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the molecular formula by considering valence.\n\nFor each atom:\n\n- Carbon: valence 4\n\n- Nitrogen: valence 3\n\n- Oxygen: valence 2\n\n- Hydrogen: valence 1\n\nLet's calculate the total number of bonds.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the concept of valence electrons and determine the number of hydrogens needed.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a molecular formula calculator or a tool, but since I'm doing this manually, let's try.\n\nLet's start with the carbon atoms:\n\n- C1: connected to C2 and three H → 3 H.\n\n- C2: connected to C1, C3, N2, and one H → 1 H.\n\n- C3: connected to C2, O1 (double bond), N1 → no H.\n\n- C4: connected to N2, O2 (double bond), and one more bond. Let's assume it's bonded to a hydrogen. So one H.\n\n- N1: connected to C3 and C2 → but wait, N1 is part of the branch on C2. Wait, N1 is connected to C3 and to C2? Or is it connected to C3 and something else?\n\nWait, the branch on C2 is C(=O)N. So C3 is connected to C2, double bonded to O1, and single bonded to N1. So N1 is connected to C3 and possibly other groups. Wait, in the SMILES, after the branch, the main chain continues with N(C=O)O. So N1 is part of the main chain? Or is it part of the branch?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for the correct molecular formula by considering the SMILES as a known compound.\n\nWait, the SMILES is CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O. Let me try to find what compound this is. Alternatively, maybe I can use a tool to calculate the molecular weight, but since I can't do that, I'll have to proceed manually.\n\nAnother approach: Let's count all the atoms explicitly, including hydrogen.\n\nStart with the SMILES: CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O\n\nLet's parse each atom and their bonds:\n\n1. First carbon (C1): connected to C2 and three H → C1H3.\n\n2. Second carbon (C2): connected to C1, the branch (C(=O)N), and the nitrogen (N1). So C2 is bonded to C1, the branch carbon (C3), and N1. That's three bonds, so it needs one more bond, which is a hydrogen → C2H1.\n\n3. Branch carbon (C3): connected to C2, double bonded to O1, and single bonded to N1. No hydrogen here.\n\n4. Oxygen (O1): double bonded to C3. No hydrogen.\n\n5. Nitrogen (N1): connected to C3 and to the main chain (C2). But wait, N1 is part of the branch, so it's connected to C3 and to... what? The branch is C(=O)N, so N1 is the end of the branch. But in the SMILES, after the branch, the main chain continues with N(C=O)O. So maybe N1 is connected to the main chain? No, the main chain is C2 connected to N1, which is then connected to the rest. Wait, the SMILES is CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O. So after the branch, it's N(C=O)O. So the main chain after C2 is N(C=O)O. So N1 is the nitrogen in the main chain after C2. Wait, no. The branch is on C2, and then the main chain continues with N(C=O)O. So C2 is connected to C1, the branch, and to N1. Then N1 is connected to C2 and has a branch of C=O and is connected to O2.\n\nSo N1 is bonded to C2, a carbonyl group (C4=O2), and an oxygen (O3). So N1 has three bonds: to C2, to C4, and to O3.\n\nNow, let's look at the carbonyl group in N(C=O)O. The carbon (C4) is double bonded to O2 and single bonded to N1. That's three bonds, so it needs one more bond. Where is that? It could be a hydrogen, so C4H1.\n\nThen the oxygen (O3) is connected to N1. Since oxygen has two bonds, and it's single bonded to N1, it needs one more bond, which is likely a hydrogen → O3H1.\n\nSo now, let's count all atoms:\n\nCarbon: C1, C2, C3, C4 → 4 carbons.\n\nOxygen: O1 (double bonded to C3), O2 (double bonded to C4), O3 (single bonded to N1) → 3 oxygens.\n\nNitrogen: N1 (bonded to C3, C2, and O3), and the N in the branch? Wait, no, the branch is C(=O)N, so N is part of the branch. Wait, in the branch, it's C(=O)N, so that's a nitrogen (N2) bonded to C3. So N2 is connected to C3 and what else? Since it's part of the branch, it might be bonded to hydrogen(s). Let's see.\n\nN2 is connected to C3. Nitrogen has three bonds. So N2 is bonded to C3 and two hydrogens? Or is it bonded to something else? In the SMILES, after the branch, it's just N, so it's likely that N2 is connected to C3 and two hydrogens. But wait, if it's part of the branch, maybe it's part of a larger group. Wait, the branch is C(=O)N, so it's a carbon double bonded to O and single bonded to N. The N is at the end of the branch. So N2 is connected to C3 and two hydrogens? Or is it part of an amine group? Let's say it's NH2, so two hydrogens.\n\nBut let's go back to counting all atoms.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\n- C: 4\n\n- O: 3\n\n- N: N1 and N2 (two nitrogens)\n\nNow, let's count hydrogen atoms:\n\n- C1H3: 3 H\n\n- C2H1: 1 H\n\n- C4H1: 1 H\n\n- O3H1: 1 H\n\n- N2: if it's bonded to C3 and two H, that's 2 H.\n\n- N1: bonded to C2, C4, and O3. Nitrogen has three bonds, so no hydrogen here.\n\n- O1: double bonded to C3, no H.\n\n- O2: double bonded to C4, no H.\n\n- Any other hydrogens? Let's check.\n\nWait, what about the hydrogens on the nitrogens and oxygens? For example, if N2 is bonded to C3 and two H, that's 2 H. O3 is bonded to N1 and one H, that's 1 H. C4 has one H. C2 has one H. C1 has three H. Are there any other hydrogens?\n\nWhat about the carbon atoms? C1 has three H, C2 has one H, C3 has no H, C4 has one H. That's 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 5 H from carbons.\n\nFrom N2: 2 H.\n\nFrom O3: 1 H.\n\nTotal H: 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 H?\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Let's go through each atom:\n\n- C1: 3 H\n\n- C2: 1 H\n\n- C3: 0 H\n\n- C4: 1 H\n\n- N1: 0 H (bonded to C2, C4, O3)\n\n- N2: 2 H (bonded to C3 and two H)\n\n- O1: 0 H (double bonded to C3)\n\n- O2: 0 H (double bonded to C4)\n\n- O3: 1 H (bonded to N1 and one H)\n\nTotal H: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8 H?\n\nWait, that's 3 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C4) + 2 (N2) + 1 (O3) = 8 H.\n\nSo the molecular formula would be C4H8O3N2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the molar mass.\n\nCarbon: 4 * 12.01 = 48.04 g/mol\n\nHydrogen: 8 * 1.008 = 8.064 g/mol\n\nOxygen: 3 * 16.00 = 48.00 g/mol\n\nNitrogen: 2 * 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass = 48.04 + 8.064 + 48.00 + 28.02 = let's add them up:\n\n48.04 + 8.064 = 56.104\n\n56.104 + 48.00 = 104.104\n\n104.104 + 28.02 = 132.124 g/mol\n\nSo approximately 132.12 g/mol, which matches option A:132.120.\n\nBut wait, let me check if my hydrogen count is correct. Because if there are any errors in the hydrogen count, the molar mass will be off.\n\nLet me recheck the hydrogen count:\n\n- C1: CH3 → 3 H\n\n- C2: CH → 1 H\n\n- C3: CH0 → 0 H (bonded to C2, O1, N2)\n\nWait, C3 is bonded to C2, double bonded to O1, and single bonded to N2. That's four bonds (single to C2, double to O1, single to N2). So no H.\n\n- C4: CH → 1 H (bonded to N1, double to O2, and one H)\n\n- N2: bonded to C3 and two H → 2 H\n\n- O3: bonded to N1 and one H → 1 H\n\n- Other atoms: no H.\n\nTotal H: 3 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C4) + 2 (N2) + 1 (O3) = 8 H. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo molecular formula is C4H8O3N2, molar mass ≈ 132.12 g/mol, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options include A:132.120, B:143.180, C:144.170, D:133.110.\n\nSo according to my calculation, the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any mistake in the molecular formula.\n\nIs there a possibility that I missed some atoms or counted incorrectly?\n\nLet me recheck the SMILES: CC(C(=O)N)N(C=O)O\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- C: 4 (as per earlier)\n\n- O: 3 (from two carbonyls and one hydroxyl)\n\n- N: 2 (from the two nitrogens)\n\n- H: 8\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nCalculating the molar mass again:\n\nCarbon: 4 * 12.01 = 48.04\n\nHydrogen: 8 * 1.008 = 8.064\n\nOxygen: 3 * 16.00 = 48.00\n\nNitrogen: 2 * 14.01 = 28.02\n\nTotal: 48.04 + 8.064 = 56.104; 56.104 + 48.00 = 104.104; 104.104 + 28.02 = 132.124 g/mol.\n\nYes, approximately 132.12 g/mol, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any possibility that the oxygen at the end is a double bond or something else. The SMILES ends with O, which is a single bond. So it's a hydroxyl group, which is one bond to the nitrogen and one bond to hydrogen.\n\nAlternatively, could it be an oxide or something else? No, because the SMILES doesn't indicate a double bond there.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the nitrogen in the branch is part of an amide, so it has one hydrogen. Let me see.\n\nIf the branch is C(=O)N, and the nitrogen has one hydrogen, then N2 has one H instead of two. Let's recalculate.\n\nIf N2 has one H instead of two, then total H would be 3 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C4) + 1 (N2) + 1 (O3) = 7 H.\n\nThen molar mass would be:\n\nCarbon: 48.04\n\nHydrogen: 7 * 1.008 = 7.056\n\nOxygen: 48.00\n\nNitrogen: 28.02\n\nTotal: 48.04 + 7.056 = 55.096 + 48.00 = 103.096 + 28.02 = 131.116 g/mol. That's close to option D:133.110, but not exactly.\n\nBut why would the nitrogen have one H instead of two? In an amide, the nitrogen typically has one hydrogen. Wait, the branch is C(=O)N. If it's an amide, the nitrogen would have one hydrogen. But in the SMILES, it's written as N, not NH. So does that mean it has no hydrogens? Or is it assumed to have one or two?\n\nThis is a critical point. In SMILES notation, explicit hydrogens are sometimes included, but often omitted. For nitrogen, the number of implicit hydrogens depends on the valence.\n\nLet's reevaluate the nitrogen in the branch (N2). It's part of C(=O)N. The carbon is double bonded to O and single bonded to N. The nitrogen has one bond to the carbon. Nitrogen typically has three bonds. So it needs two more bonds. If it's an amide nitrogen, it would have one hydrogen and one bond to another group. But in this case, the branch ends at N, so it would have two hydrogens. But if it's part of an amide, it would have one hydrogen and one bond to another group. But in this SMILES, the branch ends at N, so it must have two hydrogens to satisfy valence.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation of 2 H on N2 is correct. Hence, the molar mass is approximately 132.12 g/mol, which is option A.\n\nBut let me cross-verify with another approach. Let's use the molecular formula C4H8O3N2 and calculate the exact molar mass using more precise atomic weights.\n\nCarbon: 12.011 g/mol\n\nHydrogen: 1.008 g/mol\n\nOxygen: 16.00 g/mol\n\nNitrogen: 14.007 g/mol\n\nCalculating:\n\nCarbon: 4 * 12.011 = 48.044\n\nHydrogen: 8 * 1.008 = 8.064\n\nOxygen: 3 * 16.00 = 48.000\n\nNitrogen: 2 * 14.007 = 28.014\n\nTotal = 48.044 + 8.064 + 48.000 + 28.014 = 132.122 g/mol.\n\nRounded to three decimal places, that's 132.122 g/mol, which matches option A:132.120.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n</think>"}
