The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, specifically looking at the yield of the para-isomer for different substituted benzene compounds. The task is to arrange the substances 1 to 6 in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. The options are given as A to D, each with a different order.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how substituents on a benzene ring affect the position of electrophilic substitution. Substituents can be either activating or deactivating, and they also direct the incoming electrophile to specific positions (ortho, meta, para). \n\nElectrophilic substitution reactions in aromatic compounds are directed by the substituents present. Activating groups (like -CH3, -OCH3, -OH) usually direct the substitution to the ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups can be either meta directors or ortho/para directors depending on their electron-withdrawing nature and resonance effects.\n\nThe key here is to determine for each substituent whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's an ortho/para director or a meta director. Then, based on that, we can predict the ratio of ortho to para isomers formed. If a substituent is an ortho/para director, the product will be a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The relative amounts of ortho and para isomers can vary depending on the substituent's influence. Some substituents might favor para over ortho due to steric hindrance, even if they are ortho/para directors. However, in this problem, it's stated that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, no, the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, no, the problem states that \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Because in reality, when you do electrophilic substitution on a substituted benzene, you usually get a mixture of ortho and para isomers if the substituent is an ortho/para director. So maybe the question is assuming that only the major isomer is considered, but the wording is confusing. Wait, the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". That can't be true unless the substituent is a meta director, which would direct the incoming group to the meta position, resulting in only one isomer. But the question is about the yield of the para-isomer, so perhaps it's a misstatement. Maybe it's supposed to say that only monobromination occurs (i.e., one substitution), not that only one isomer is formed. That makes more sense. So, the question is about the yield of the para-isomer among the possible isomers (ortho and para if the substituent is ortho/para director, or meta if it's a meta director). Wait, but if the substituent is a meta director, then the product is meta, so the para yield would be zero. Therefore, the compounds with meta directors would have the lowest para yield (zero), and those with ortho/para directors would have some para yield, depending on the directing effect.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine for each substituent whether it's an ortho/para director or a meta director. Then, for ortho/para directors, we need to determine which ones favor the para isomer more, leading to a higher weight fraction of para isomer. For meta directors, the para yield is zero, so they will be at the bottom of the order.\n\nLet's go through each compound:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene): The methyl group is an activating group and an ortho/para director. Methyl groups tend to direct substitution to both ortho and para positions, but due to steric hindrance, the para isomer might be favored slightly over the ortho isomers. However, the exact ratio can vary. Typically, toluene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers with para being more (maybe 60-40 split?).\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating group. Esters have a carbonyl group which is electron-withdrawing through induction, but the oxygen has lone pairs that can participate in resonance. Wait, but the ester group is attached to the benzene via a carbonyl. The ester group is a meta director? Wait, the directing effect of ester groups. Let me recall. The -COOR group is a meta director because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing through resonance (the -R effect), which deactivates the ring and directs substitution to the meta position. Therefore, the ester group is a meta director. Therefore, if the substituent is a meta director, the incoming bromine would go to the meta position, so the para yield would be zero. Wait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". If the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would go to the meta position, so there's only one product. Therefore, the para yield is zero. So for compound 2, the para yield is zero. Wait, but the options given don't have all the same starting points. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no. The substituent's directing effect. For example, the nitro group is a meta director. So when you have nitrobenzene, the incoming group goes to the meta position, so there's only one product (if only one substitution occurs). Therefore, for such compounds, the para yield is zero. Therefore, compounds with meta directors would have para yield zero. So in the list, if any of the compounds have meta directors, they will be at the bottom (lowest para yield). If they have ortho/para directors, they will have some para yield, depending on their directing ability.\n\nSo let's go through each compound:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: ortho/para director. Para yield is significant.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a meta director. So para yield is zero.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is an ortho/para director. Chlorine is deactivating but ortho/para directing. Para yield would be some.\n\n4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a meta director. Para yield is zero.\n\n5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl group is an activating group, ortho/para director. Similar to methyl, but with a larger alkyl group. The para yield might be higher than methyl due to steric hindrance in the ortho positions? Or maybe similar? The directing effect of ethyl group is similar to methyl.\n\n6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a meta director. Deactivating, meta director. So para yield is zero.\n\nTherefore, compounds 2,4,6 have meta directors (para yield zero). The rest (1,3,5) have ortho/para directors. So the order must start with the compounds with para yield zero. But the options given have different orders. Let's check the options:\n\nOption A:4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOption B:3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOption C:4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOption D:6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nWait, first, the compounds with para yield zero are 2 (COOCH2CH3), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH). So these should come first in the order. However, the options vary. Let's check the options:\n\nOption A:4<6<2<... So 4,6,2 are first. But 4 is NO2 (meta director), 6 is COOH (meta), 2 is COOC2H5 (meta). So all three have zero para yield. So the order between them? Since they all have zero, their order among themselves doesn't affect the overall ranking. However, the options may differ in how they order these. For example, if in the options the first part is 4<6<2, then they are ordered as 4, then 6, then 2. But why? Since all have zero, they are equal, but maybe the question assumes that some have lower para yield than others? Wait, but if they have zero, they are all equal. But maybe the question is considering the possibility that some substituents might have a very small amount of para isomer due to some minor effects, even if they are meta directors. However, typically, meta directors are considered to direct substitution to the meta position almost exclusively, so the para yield is negligible. Therefore, in the options, these three (4,6,2) should be considered equal, but the options may have different orderings. However, the correct order must have all three (2,4,6) at the beginning. Let's check the options:\n\nOption C:4<2<6<... So 4,2,6. Option D:6<2<4<... So 6,2,4. Option A:4<6<2. Option B: starts with 3, which is wrong. So options B and C and D have different orders for the first three. But if all three have zero, then the order between them is arbitrary. However, perhaps there's a reason why they are ordered differently. Maybe the question is not about para yield being zero, but about the directing effect. Wait, the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, maybe I misinterpreted that. If only one monobromo derivative is formed, that would mean that the substituent is directing to only one position. For example, a strong meta director would give only the meta isomer. But for ortho/para directors, if there is steric hindrance, maybe only one isomer is formed. Wait, but the problem says \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\". That is a strange assumption. For example, in reality, when you brominate toluene, you get a mixture of ortho and para isomers. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So maybe the question is assuming that the reaction is such that only the major isomer is formed. Or perhaps the question is about the major product. So, for example, if a substituent is an ortho/para director, but due to steric effects, only the para isomer is formed. In that case, the yield of para isomer would be 100% for those compounds. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the relative yield of the para isomer in the mixture. For example, if a substituent gives 90% para and 10% ortho, then the weight fraction is 90%. If another gives 60% para and 40% ortho, then the weight fraction is 60%. So the order would be based on the directing effect of the substituents towards para vs. ortho. So for ortho/para directors, we need to determine which ones favor para more, leading to higher para yield.\n\nTherefore, the key is to determine for each substituent (those that are ortho/para directors) the relative directing effect towards para. For example, electron-donating groups (activators) like -CH3, -C2H5, -Cl (wait, Cl is deactivating but ortho/para director) may have different directing effects. Also, the strength of the directing effect.\n\nLet me recall the directing effects of the substituents:\n\n- Strong ortho/para directors (activators): -NH2, -NHR, -NR2, -OH, -OCH3, -CH3, -C2H5, etc.\n\n- Weak ortho/para directors (deactivators): -Cl, -Br, -F (halogens are deactivating but ortho/para directors)\n\n- Meta directors (deactivators): -NO2, -CN, -SO3H, -COOH, -COOR, -CHO, -COR, etc.\n\nSo for our compounds:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: ortho/para director (activating)\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: meta director (deactivating)\n\n3) C6H5-Cl: ortho/para director (deactivating)\n\n4) C6H5-NO2: meta director (deactivating)\n\n5) C6H5-C2H5: ortho/para director (activating)\n\n6) C6H5-COOH: meta director (deactivating)\n\nTherefore, compounds 2,4,6 have zero para yield (assuming only one monobromo derivative is formed). But if the question is about the yield of para isomer in the mixture (i.e., the fraction of para isomer when multiple isomers are formed), then compounds 1,3,5 would have some para yield. The problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". That is confusing. If only one is formed, then for meta directors, it's the meta isomer, so para is zero. For ortho/para directors, if only one is formed, it would be either ortho or para. But which one? That depends on the directing effect. For example, if the substituent strongly favors para, then the product is para; if it favors ortho, then ortho. So the question is, for each ortho/para director, which isomer is the major one. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para isomer would be 100% if the major isomer is para, and 0% if the major isomer is ortho (but in reality, both are formed, but the question is assuming only one is formed). So the problem is likely asking us to assume that for ortho/para directors, the major isomer is either para or ortho, and we need to determine which ones have higher para yield.\n\nTherefore, we need to know for each substituent whether it directs more to para or ortho. For example, methyl groups (-CH3) in toluene give a mixture of ortho and para isomers, with para being more due to steric hindrance. The ratio is approximately 65% para and 35% ortho. Similarly, ethyl groups (-C2H5) would have similar directing effects, maybe even more para due to larger size causing more steric hindrance in ortho positions. For halogens like -Cl, the directing effect is ortho/para, but since they are deactivating, the ratio might be different. Chlorobenzene, when nitrated, gives mainly ortho and para, but the para isomer is more (around 60% para and 40% ortho). So for -Cl, the para yield is higher than ortho. So in that case, the para yield would be higher. So among the ortho/para directors, we need to rank them based on their para directing effect.\n\nSo the order of para yield (from highest to lowest) for ortho/para directors would be:\n\nStrongest para director: ?\n\nLet me recall the directing effects. For activating groups, the order of directing effect (ortho/para) can vary. For example, -OH is a strong ortho/para director, but due to steric hindrance, para is favored. Similarly, -NH2 is a strong director, but again para is favored. For alkyl groups like -CH3 and -C2H5, the directing effect is similar, but the larger the alkyl group, the more steric hindrance, leading to more para isomer. Therefore, -C2H5 might have a higher para yield than -CH3. For halogens like -Cl, the directing effect is ortho/para, but because of the deactivating nature and the possibility of resonance (the lone pairs on Cl can donate via resonance, but the inductive effect is electron-withdrawing), the directing effect is weaker compared to activating groups. However, the ratio between ortho and para is still in favor of para, but perhaps not as much as for alkyl groups.\n\nSo the order from highest para yield to lowest among ortho/para directors would be:\n\n1. -C2H5 (compound 5)\n2. -CH3 (compound 1)\n3. -Cl (compound 3)\n\nTherefore, the para yield fractions would be highest for 5, then 1, then 3.\n\nFor the meta directors (compounds 2,4,6), the para yield is zero. Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield (increasing) would be:\n\nFirst the meta directors (2,4,6) with zero, then the ortho/para directors in order of lowest para yield to highest: 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nSo the full order would be: 2,4,6 < 3 < 1 < 5. However, the options given are:\n\nA:4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nB:3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nC:4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nD:6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nWait, the correct order should be the meta directors first (all with zero para yield), then the ortho/para directors in order of 3 < 1 < 5. But the options don't have this exact order. Let's check each option:\n\nOption A: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3. So the order is 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOC2H5), then 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5), 3 (Cl). But according to our reasoning, the ortho/para directors should come after all the meta directors. However, in option A, after 4,6,2 (meta directors), the next is 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5), then 3 (Cl). But according to our analysis, 3 (Cl) should come after 1 and 5. So this order is 3 at the end, which would mean the para yield of 3 is higher than 1 and 5, which contradicts our earlier analysis. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: 3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4. This starts with 3 (Cl), which is an ortho/para director, but it's placed before the meta directors (6,2,4). This is incorrect because meta directors should have lower para yield. So option B is wrong.\n\nOption C: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5. Here, the first three are meta directors (4,2,6), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5). This matches our reasoning: meta directors first, then 3 < 1 < 5. So this would be the correct order. Let's check: 4 (NO2), 2 (COOC2H5), 6 (COOH) are meta directors with zero para yield. Then 3 (Cl) has lower para yield than 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5). Then 1 has lower para yield than 5. So option C is 4<2<6<3<1<5. Which is option C. \n\nOption D: 6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3. The first three are meta directors (6,2,4), then 5 (C2H5), then 1 (CH3), then 3 (Cl). But according to our analysis, the ortho/para directors should be ordered 3 < 1 < 5. So in option D, it's ordered as 5 < 1 < 3, which is the reverse. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: 4<2<6<3<1<5.\n\nWait, but let's verify the order between the meta directors. Are there any differences in their para yields? Since they are all meta directors, their para yield is zero, so their order among themselves shouldn't matter. However, the options have different orders. For example, option C has 4 < 2 < 6, while option A has 4 < 6 < 2, and option D has 6 < 2 < 4. But since they are all zero, the order between them is arbitrary. However, maybe there's a reason why they are ordered differently. Perhaps the question is considering the strength of the meta directing effect. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) is a stronger meta director than -COOH or -COOC2H5. However, since the para yield is zero for all, their order shouldn't affect the overall ranking. But the options may have different orders for the meta directors. However, since the question is about the para yield, which is zero for all three, their order is irrelevant. However, in the options, the correct one must have the meta directors first, followed by the ortho/para directors in order of 3 < 1 < 5. Therefore, option C is the correct one.\n\nBut let me double-check the directing effect of the substituents:\n\n-NO2 is a strong meta director.\n\n-COOH is a meta director.\n\n-COOC2H5 is a meta director.\n\nBetween these, the strength of deactivation and directing effect may vary, but since they all have zero para yield, the order between them is not important. However, in option C, the order is 4 < 2 < 6. Let's think if there's any reason for that. For example, if the deactivating strength affects the rate of reaction, but the question is about the yield of para isomer, which is zero for all. So their order among themselves is arbitrary. Therefore, any order of the meta directors is acceptable as long as they are first. But the options have different orders, so we need to see which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not assuming that only one isomer is formed for the meta directors, but rather that only one monobromination occurs (i.e., one substitution), but the product is a mixture of isomers. In that case, for the meta directors, there is only one isomer (meta), so the para yield is zero. For the ortho/para directors, there is a mixture, and we need to order them by the percentage of para isomer.\n\nSo the correct order is: meta directors (zero) first, then ortho/para directors ordered by increasing para yield. As discussed, the order of ortho/para directors is 3 < 1 < 5. Therefore, the full order is 4,2,6 < 3 < 1 < 5. But the options have different orders for the meta directors. However, since all meta directors have zero, any order among them is acceptable. However, the options may have specific orders based on some other consideration.\n\nWait, but the options given have different orders for the meta directors. For example, option C has 4 < 2 < 6. Let's think: why would they be ordered like that? Maybe based on the strength of the meta directing effect. The stronger the meta director, the more the reaction is directed to meta, but since the para yield is zero, the order between them is not relevant. However, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. If the question assumes that the meta directors have different rates of reaction, but the para yield is still zero, then their order is arbitrary. Therefore, the correct answer must have the meta directors first in any order, followed by the ortho/para directors in order of 3 < 1 < 5. Therefore, among the options, option C is the only one that follows this pattern: 4<2<6<3<1<5. The other options either place the ortho/para directors before the meta directors (B and D) or have the wrong order for the ortho/para directors (A and D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>"}
