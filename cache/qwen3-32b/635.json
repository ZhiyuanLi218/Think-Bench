The problem is about a textbook weighing 30 N at sea level, and we need to find out its weight on a mountain peak 6,000 meters above sea level. The options are given as A:60 N, B:15 N, C:30 N, D:7.5 N. Hmm. Alright, so the key here is understanding how gravity changes with altitude.\n\nFirst, I remember that the weight of an object is the force due to gravity, which is mass times gravitational acceleration (W = mg). The gravitational acceleration on Earth's surface is approximately 9.8 m/s², but it decreases as you move away from the Earth's center. So, if we go up a mountain, the distance from the center of the Earth increases, which should slightly reduce the gravitational acceleration, hence the weight of the textbook.\n\nBut how do we calculate that? Well, Newton's law of universal gravitation says that the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of the two objects. In this case, the Earth and the textbook. The formula is F = G*(M*m)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, m is the textbook's mass, and r is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nAt sea level, the distance r is the Earth's radius, which is given as 6,400 km. Converting that to meters, that's 6,400,000 meters. The mountain is 6,000 meters above sea level, so the new distance r' would be 6,400,000 + 6,000 = 6,406,000 meters.\n\nSo, the weight at the mountain peak compared to sea level should be the ratio of the distances squared. Since weight is proportional to 1/r², the new weight W' = W * (r / r')².\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The original weight W is 30 N. The original radius r is 6,400,000 m, and the new radius r' is 6,406,000 m. So the ratio r/r' is 6,400,000 / 6,406,000. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the numbers. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 1,000 to make it 6,400 / 6,406. That's approximately 1 / (1 + 6/6400). Wait, 6,406 is 6,400 + 6, so the denominator is the original radius plus 6 km. Wait, no, the mountain is 6,000 meters, which is 6 km. So the increase in radius is 6 km. So the ratio is (original radius) / (original radius + 6 km). The original radius is 6,400 km, so the ratio is 6,400 / (6,400 + 6) = 6,400 / 6,406.\n\nTo compute this ratio, maybe approximate it as 1 / (1 + 6/6400). Since 6/6400 is a small number, we can use the binomial approximation. The formula (1 + x)^-1 ≈ 1 - x when x is small. Similarly, (1 + x)^-2 ≈ 1 - 2x. Wait, since we have (r/r')² = [1/(1 + x)]² ≈ 1 - 2x, where x = 6/6400.\n\nSo let's compute x first. 6 divided by 6400. Let's see, 6/6400 = 0.0009375. So x ≈ 0.0009375. Then, the ratio squared is approximately 1 - 2x = 1 - 2*(0.0009375) = 1 - 0.001875 = 0.998125.\n\nTherefore, the new weight W' ≈ 30 N * 0.998125 ≈ 30 * 0.998 ≈ 29.94 N. That's almost 30 N. So the weight would decrease slightly, but the options given are 60 N, 15 N, 30 N, 7.5 N. The closest is C:30 N. But wait, the options are A to D, and the question says \"best estimate\". Since the decrease is only about 0.1875%, which is 0.56 N decrease from 30 N, so 30 - 0.56 ≈ 29.44 N. Still, that's very close to 30 N. So the answer should be C:30 N.\n\nBut let me check if I did the approximation correctly. Maybe I should compute the exact ratio instead of using the binomial approximation.\n\nOriginal radius r = 6,400,000 m\n\nNew radius r' = 6,406,000 m\n\nRatio r/r' = 6,400,000 / 6,406,000 = 6,400 / 6,406 = divide numerator and denominator by 2: 3,200 / 3,203 ≈ Let's compute 3,203 - 3,200 = 3. So, 3,200 / 3,203 = 1 - 3/3,203 ≈ 1 - 0.0009366. So squaring that: (1 - 0.0009366)² ≈ 1 - 2*(0.0009366) + (0.0009366)² ≈ 1 - 0.001873 + negligible. So same as before, approximately 0.998127. Multiply by 30 N gives 30 * 0.998127 ≈ 29.9438 N, which is about 29.94 N. So, indeed, very close to 30 N. So the best estimate among the options is C:30 N.\n\nBut wait, the options are A:60 N, B:15 N, C:30 N, D:7.5 N. So C is the correct answer. The weight doesn't change much because the mountain is only 6,000 meters high, which is tiny compared to Earth's radius of 6,400 km (which is 6,400,000 meters). So 6,000 is 0.09375% of the radius. So the change in distance is minuscule, hence the change in weight is also minuscule. Therefore, the best estimate is still 30 N.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's another approach. The formula for gravitational acceleration at a height h above Earth's surface is approximately g' = g*(1 - 2h/R), where R is Earth's radius. Let me check that formula. Yes, if h is much smaller than R, then the approximation g' ≈ g*(1 - 2h/R) is used. Let's apply this.\n\nGiven h = 6,000 m = 6 km, R = 6,400 km = 6,400,000 m.\n\nSo 2h/R = 2*6,000 / 6,400,000 = 12,000 / 6,400,000 = 0.001875. Therefore, g' ≈ g*(1 - 0.001875) = g*0.998125. So the gravitational acceleration decreases by about 0.1875%, which is the same as before. Therefore, the weight would be 30 N * 0.998125 ≈ 29.94 N, so again, very close to 30 N. So the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the weight halves or doubles, they might pick B or A, but that's incorrect because the distance is not doubling or halving. The distance is increasing by a tiny amount. So the answer is definitely C:30 N.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate is option C.\n</think>"}
