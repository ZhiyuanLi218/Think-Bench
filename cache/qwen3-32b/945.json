So, there are two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, and after they're done, the products are combined and analyzed using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. The question is asking how many peaks each chromatogram will show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each reaction does. Let's start with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones and esters to alcohols. But wait, in this case, the compound is a ketone (since it's a -one). LAH usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. However, LAH is a very strong reducing agent. Wait, but for ketones, I think that sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is sufficient. LAH might also reduce esters, but here the starting material is a ketone. So the product here should be the corresponding secondary alcohol. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: it's a six-carbon chain with a ketone at carbon 3 and a methoxy group at carbon 5. The (S) configuration is at the chiral center, which would be the carbon where the ketone is attached? Wait, the ketone is at C3. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3 with the rest of the chain. Wait, hexan-3-one would be CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3. But with a 5-methoxy group. So maybe the structure is CH3CH2COCH2CH(OCH3)CH3? Wait, maybe I need to draw it out mentally. Let me think: hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3. So positions 1-2-3-4-5-6. The ketone is between C3 and C4? No, the numbering for ketones is such that the ketone is at the lowest possible number. So for hexan-3-one, the ketone is at C3. So the structure would be CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3. Now, adding a 5-methoxy group. So the 5th carbon (which is the second to last carbon in the chain) would have a methoxy group. So the structure is CH3CH2COCH2CH(OCH3)CH3? Wait, but the original compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the chiral center is at C3? Because the ketone is at C3, so the carbon adjacent to the ketone (C3) would be a chiral center? Wait, the ketone is at C3. So the carbon at C3 is double bonded to oxygen, so that carbon is part of the ketone. The chiral center would be at C3? No, wait. Let me think again. The ketone is at C3, so the structure is R-C(=O)-R'. The R group would be CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me try to write the correct structure. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3. Now, the 5-methoxy group is on the fifth carbon. So counting from the left, the first carbon is CH3, second CH2, third CO, fourth CH2, fifth CH2, sixth CH3. Wait, no, the fifth carbon would be the one adjacent to the sixth. So maybe the structure is CH3CH2COCH2CH(OCH3)CH3. So the fifth carbon (counting from the left) has a methoxy group. So the carbon chain is: C1: CH3, C2: CH2, C3: CO, C4: CH2, C5: CH(OCH3), C6: CH3. Therefore, the chiral center is at C5? Wait, because the 5-methoxy group is on C5. Wait, but C5 is a CH(OCH3) group. Wait, but the original compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the configuration is (S) at C5? Or at C3? Wait, the ketone is at C3, which is a ketone group. The chiral center would be at C5 because that's where the methoxy group is attached. Wait, no, the methoxy group is on C5, but the ketone is on C3. The carbon at C3 is part of the ketone (C=O), so that carbon isn't chiral. The chiral center is at C5? Let me check. The structure is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So the C5 is CH(OCH3), which has four different groups? Let's see: the CH(OCH3) at C5 is connected to: - a CH2CO group (from C4), - a CH3 group (C6), - an OCH3 group (the methoxy), and - a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon at C5 is CH(OCH3). So it's connected to: - the C4 (which is CH2), so that's a CH2 group, - the C6 (CH3), - the OCH3, and - a hydrogen. So yes, four different groups: the CH2 from C4, the CH3 from C6, the OCH3, and a hydrogen. Therefore, C5 is a chiral center. The configuration is given as (S). So the original compound has an S configuration at C5.\n\nNow, when we treat this with LAH. LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a ketone (hexan-3-one) with a methoxy group. So LAH would reduce the ketone (C=O at C3) to a CH2OH group? Wait, no. Wait, LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The ketone is at C3, so reduction would give a secondary alcohol at C3. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxy-3-hexanol. But wait, the original compound has an S configuration at C5. However, when we reduce the ketone at C3, that carbon becomes a CH2OH group. The reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol would not affect the configuration at C5, right? Because the reduction is happening at C3, and the chiral center at C5 remains. So the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxy-3-hexanol. So that's the product from Reaction I.\n\nNow, Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone. The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So two ketone groups at C2 and C4. NaBH4 is a reducing agent. It can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. However, in the case of a diketone, each ketone can be reduced. So each ketone would become a secondary alcohol. So the product would be 2,4-pentanediol. Let me write the structure: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So both ketones are reduced to alcohols. Since there's excess NaBH4, both ketones are reduced. The product is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, is this molecule chiral? Let's see. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Each of the hydroxyl groups is on C2 and C4. Each of these carbons (C2 and C4) is adjacent to a CH2 group. Let me check for chirality. For C2: connected to -CH3, -OH, -CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So for C2: it's connected to CH3, OH, CH2 (to C3), and H. Wait, the carbon at C2 is CH(OH). So it has four different groups? Let's see: the CH(OH) at C2 is connected to: - a CH3 group (from C1), - an OH group, - a CH2 group (to C3), and a hydrogen. So yes, four different groups. Similarly, C4 is the same. So each of these carbons is a chiral center. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If you look at the molecule, it's symmetric around the center carbon (C3). So the configuration at C2 and C4 are related by the plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is a meso compound. Because even though there are two chiral centers, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image due to the internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, the product from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is not optically active. Therefore, there are no enantiomers, and the molecule is not chiral overall. So the product is a single compound, a meso diol.\n\nNow, after both reactions are complete, the products are combined. Let's list the products:\n\nFrom Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxy-3-hexanol. This is a secondary alcohol with a chiral center at C5 (since the original compound had an S configuration there, and the reduction at C3 didn't affect that). Wait, but wait, when we reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, does that create a new chiral center at C3? Let me think. The original compound was (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is at C3. Reduction of the ketone (C=O) to a CH2OH group. Wait, no. Wait, the ketone is R2-C(=O)-R. Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol would give R2-CH(OH)-R. So in this case, the ketone at C3 would become a CH(OH) group. Therefore, the carbon at C3 becomes a chiral center. Wait, the original compound had a chiral center at C5 (S configuration). After reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes a secondary alcohol, which introduces a new chiral center at C3. So now, the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. Wait, but the original compound had only one chiral center at C5. So when we reduce the ketone at C3, which was not a chiral center before, we create a new chiral center at C3. Therefore, the product of Reaction I would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. Now, what is the configuration at C3? Since LAH is a strong reducing agent, does it affect the stereochemistry? Wait, LAH is a reducing agent that typically adds hydride from the re face or si face? Hmm. The reduction of a ketone with LAH is usually stereoselective, but since the ketone is in a molecule with existing chirality, the product's stereochemistry at the new chiral center depends on the approach of the hydride. However, since the question doesn't specify any stereoselectivity, I think we can assume that the reduction proceeds with some stereochemistry, but since the starting material already has an S configuration at C5, and the new chiral center at C3 is formed, we need to determine if the product is a single enantiomer or a mixture. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but in the case of a ketone with existing chirality, the reduction can lead to a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture? Hmm. Wait, for example, when you reduce a ketone with LAH, the hydride attack can be from either face of the carbonyl group. In the absence of any other stereoelectronic factors, this would lead to a racemic mixture. However, if the carbonyl group is in a chiral environment, the approach of the hydride may be hindered from one side, leading to a single enantiomer. But without specific information about the reaction conditions or the mechanism, I think we have to assume that the reduction leads to a single enantiomer. Wait, but wait, in the original compound, there is a chiral center at C5. The carbonyl group is at C3. So when reducing the carbonyl group at C3, the existing chirality at C5 might influence the approach of the hydride. However, without specific knowledge of the stereochemistry of the reduction, it's hard to say. However, in most cases, unless specified otherwise, when you reduce a ketone in a chiral environment with LAH, you might get a single enantiomer. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at the new chiral center. Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent. For example, when you reduce a ketone with LAH, you typically get a racemic mixture because the hydride can attack from either face. However, in a chiral environment, maybe the approach is not symmetric. For example, if the carbonyl is adjacent to a chiral center, the approach from one face might be more hindered, leading to a single enantiomer. But I think in the absence of specific information, we can assume that the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at the new chiral center. Wait, but the problem states that the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the product of Reaction I would be a secondary alcohol with two chiral centers: C3 and C5. The original compound had an S configuration at C5. The reduction of the ketone at C3 would create a new chiral center at C3. Depending on the stereochemistry of the reduction, this could be either R or S. However, since the starting material is (S) at C5, maybe the reduction proceeds with a specific stereochemistry. But without knowing the exact mechanism, I think the problem is testing knowledge about the number of stereoisomers. Wait, but maybe the product is a single enantiomer. Let me think again. If the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and we reduce the ketone at C3, which is adjacent to the chiral center at C5. The carbonyl group is in a chiral environment. The hydride attack could be from the Re or Si face. If the attack is from one face, you get one enantiomer; from the other face, the opposite enantiomer. However, in a chiral environment, the approach might be stereoselective. For example, in the case of a prochiral ketone adjacent to a chiral center, the reduction might proceed with a specific stereochemistry. However, without specific information, perhaps the problem assumes that the reduction leads to a single enantiomer. Alternatively, maybe the product is a racemic mixture. This is a bit ambiguous. Wait, but in the problem statement, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The product after reduction would have two chiral centers. If the reduction is not stereoselective, then we would have a racemic mixture at the new chiral center (C3). However, if the reduction is stereoselective, then we would get a single enantiomer. Since the question is about the number of peaks in HPLC, which depends on the number of different compounds, I need to figure out how many different compounds are present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product from Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers. But if the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, then the product would be a mixture of two enantiomers (since C3 and C5 are both chiral, but if the reduction at C3 is racemic, then the overall product would be a mixture of two enantiomers, each having R and S at C3, while C5 remains S). Wait, but if the original compound had S at C5, and the reduction at C3 is racemic, then the product would be two enantiomers: one with R at C3 and S at C5, and the other with S at C3 and S at C5. These two would be enantiomers. However, since they are enantiomers, they would co-elute in a normal-phase HPLC (since enantiomers have the same physical properties except for their interaction with chiral stationary phases). Therefore, in normal-phase HPLC, these two would be one peak. But in chiral HPLC, they would separate into two peaks. However, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the product of Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The product after LAH reduction is 5-methoxy-3-hexanol. The structure is CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2CH(OCH3)CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the original compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes a CH(OH) group. So the structure would be CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2CH(OCH3)CH3? Wait, let me count the carbons again. Hexan-3-one is six carbons. The 5-methoxy group is on C5. After reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes a CH(OH) group. So the structure is CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2CH(OCH3)CH3. Wait, but that would be a six-carbon chain. Let me write it out:\n\nCarbon positions 1-2-3-4-5-6.\n\nOriginal ketone at C3: so positions 1-2-3(=O)-4-5-OCH3-6.\n\nAfter reduction, C3 becomes CH(OH). So the structure is CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2CH(OCH3)CH3. Now, the chiral centers are at C3 and C5. The original compound had (S) at C5. The reduction at C3 creates a new chiral center. If the reduction is not stereoselective, then we would have a racemic mixture at C3. So the product would be a mixture of two enantiomers: one with R at C3 and S at C5, and the other with S at C3 and S at C5. These two enantiomers would be present in equal amounts. Therefore, in total, the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. However, if the reduction is stereoselective, leading to a single enantiomer, then the product would be a single compound with two chiral centers. But without knowing the exact stereochemistry of the reduction, it's hard to say. However, in most cases, unless specified otherwise, the reduction of a ketone in a chiral environment with LAH would lead to a single enantiomer. Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent, and in the absence of specific stereoelectronic effects, the reduction would be racemic. However, the presence of the existing chiral center at C5 might influence the approach of the hydride. For example, the hydride could attack from the less hindered face. This is a common scenario in such reductions. For example, in the case of a prochiral ketone adjacent to a chiral center, the hydride attack is stereoselective, leading to a single enantiomer. Therefore, the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer with (S) configuration at C5 and a specific configuration at C3. Therefore, the product is a single compound with two chiral centers. Therefore, the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer.\n\nNow, moving to Reaction II: the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. As discussed earlier, it has two chiral centers but is not chiral overall due to the internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's a single compound, not a mixture of enantiomers or diastereomers.\n\nNow, after combining the products of Reaction I and Reaction II, we have two compounds: the product from Reaction I (a single enantiomer with two chiral centers) and the product from Reaction II (a meso compound with two chiral centers but not chiral overall).\n\nNow, we need to determine how many peaks they would show in normal-phase HPLC and in chiral HPLC.\n\nFirst, normal-phase HPLC. In normal-phase HPLC, the separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. Enantiomers will have the same retention time in normal-phase HPLC because they have identical physical properties except for their interaction with chiral stationary phases. Diastereomers, on the other hand, will have different retention times and thus show separate peaks.\n\nSo, let's analyze the two products:\n\n1. Product from Reaction I: a single enantiomer with two chiral centers. Let's call this Compound A.\n\n2. Product from Reaction II: a meso compound (Compound B).\n\nAre these two compounds different in structure? Yes. Compound A is a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group, while Compound B is a diol. Therefore, they have different structures and different polarities. Therefore, they will show as two separate peaks in normal-phase HPLC. So that's two peaks from these two compounds.\n\nWait, but wait. What if there are multiple isomers or stereoisomers? Let me check again.\n\nProduct from Reaction I: if it's a single enantiomer, then it's one compound. Product from Reaction II: one compound (meso). So total two compounds. Therefore, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. However, wait, what if the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture? Earlier, I was considering that the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, but if it's a racemic mixture, then in normal-phase HPLC, the two enantiomers would co-elute as one peak. So, if Reaction I gives a racemic mixture, then we have two compounds: racemic mixture (one peak) and meso compound (another peak). So total two peaks. If Reaction I gives a single enantiomer, then it's two compounds (single enantiomer and meso compound), two peaks. Either way, two peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\nBut wait, what if the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer (Compound A) and the product from Reaction II is the meso compound (Compound B). Are they different enough in structure to show as separate peaks? Yes. So two peaks.\n\nNow, for chiral HPLC. In chiral HPLC, enantiomers will be separated into two peaks. Diastereomers will also be separated, but since the meso compound is not chiral, it will be a single peak. Let's analyze.\n\nProduct from Reaction I: if it's a single enantiomer, then in chiral HPLC, it will be one peak. Wait, but if it's a single enantiomer, then in chiral HPLC, it's one peak. However, if the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, then it would be two peaks. But earlier, we considered that the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer. Wait, but the question is about the products after the reactions are 100% completed. The starting material for Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. If the reduction is stereoselective, then the product is a single enantiomer. If not, then it's a racemic mixture. But the problem doesn't specify. However, given that the starting material is a specific enantiomer, and LAH is used, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer. Therefore, in chiral HPLC, the product from Reaction I would be one peak (the single enantiomer). The product from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is not chiral, so it would be one peak. Therefore, total of two peaks. But wait, that's only two peaks. However, the answer options don't have 2 peaks in chiral HPLC. Let me check the answer options again. The options are:\n\nA: 3 peaks in both\n\nB: 4 in chiral, 2 in normal\n\nC: 3 in chiral, 2 in normal\n\nD: 5 in chiral, 4 in normal\n\nHmm. So according to my current analysis, normal-phase would have two peaks (Compound A and B), and chiral HPLC would have two peaks (Compound A as one peak, Compound B as one peak). But none of the options match this. Therefore, my previous analysis must be incorrect. Let me re-examine.\n\nPerhaps the product from Reaction I is not a single enantiomer but a racemic mixture. Let me reconsider. If the reduction of the ketone in Reaction I leads to a racemic mixture at the new chiral center (C3), then the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Each enantiomer has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. However, since the original compound had an S configuration at C5, and the reduction at C3 is racemic, the two enantiomers would have configurations (R at C3 and S at C5) and (S at C3 and S at C5). These are two enantiomers. In normal-phase HPLC, they would co-elute as one peak. In chiral HPLC, they would separate into two peaks. Therefore, the product from Reaction I would be one peak in normal-phase and two peaks in chiral HPLC. The product from Reaction II is the meso compound, which is one peak in both. Therefore, when combined, the total in normal-phase would be two peaks (the racemic mixture from Reaction I as one peak, and the meso compound as another peak). In chiral HPLC, the racemic mixture from Reaction I would be two peaks, and the meso compound would be one peak, totaling three peaks. Therefore, the answer would be C: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. Which is option C.\n\nBut why would the reduction lead to a racemic mixture? Because LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols in a racemic manner unless there's a chiral environment that controls the stereochemistry. However, in this case, the ketone is adjacent to a chiral center (C5). The presence of the chiral center at C5 might influence the approach of the hydride, making the reduction stereoselective. However, in the absence of specific information, perhaps the problem assumes that the reduction is not stereoselective, leading to a racemic mixture. Therefore, the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Therefore, in normal-phase HPLC, it's one peak, and in chiral HPLC, it's two peaks. The product from Reaction II is a meso compound, one peak in both. So combined, in normal-phase: 2 peaks (racemic mixture and meso compound), in chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (two from the racemic mixture and one from the meso compound). Hence, option C.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. The product from Reaction II is a meso compound. In chiral HPLC, would it show as one peak or two? Since it's not chiral, it would not interact with the chiral stationary phase, so it would elute as a single peak. Therefore, in chiral HPLC, the three peaks would be: the two enantiomers from Reaction I's racemic mixture, and the meso compound. Hence, three peaks in chiral HPLC, two in normal-phase. Therefore, option C.\n\nBut let's also check if there are any other products. For example, in Reaction I, is there only one product? The reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol. Yes, only one product. But if it's a racemic mixture, then two enantiomers. In Reaction II, only one product, the meso compound. So when combined, two compounds (racemic mixture and meso compound). Therefore, in normal-phase: two peaks. In chiral HPLC: two peaks from the racemic mixture (split into two enantiomers) and one peak from the meso compound, totaling three peaks. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nAnother angle: Let's count the number of stereoisomers present in the combined products.\n\nProduct from Reaction I: if it's a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, that's two stereoisomers.\n\nProduct from Reaction II: one stereoisomer (meso compound).\n\nTotal stereoisomers: 3. In chiral HPLC, each stereoisomer would be a separate peak. However, the meso compound is not chiral, so it would be one peak. The two enantiomers from Reaction I would be two peaks. So total three peaks in chiral HPLC. In normal-phase HPLC, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would be one peak, and the meso compound another peak. So two peaks. Therefore, option C: 3 in chiral, 2 in normal.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
