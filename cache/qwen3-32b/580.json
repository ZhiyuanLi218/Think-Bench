Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about holes in semiconductors. \n\nA hole is essentially the absence of an electron in the valence band, right? When an electron is removed, it creates a hole, and this hole behaves like a positive charge carrier. The velocity of the hole should be related to how the electron's velocity changes with respect to its wave vector k. But wait, since the hole is a quasiparticle, its effective mass and velocity might be different from the actual electron. \n\nThe energy of the electron is given by E = -1×10⁻³⁷ k² J. The negative sign here is interesting. In typical semiconductor physics, the valence band has a maximum at k=0, so the energy decreases as k increases. But here, the energy is negative and proportional to -k². Wait, maybe that's just a different way of writing it. Let me think. In most cases, the energy near the bottom of the conduction band is written as E = (ħ² k²)/(2m*), which is positive. But for the valence band, near the top, sometimes people use a similar expression but with a negative coefficient because the curvature is downward. So maybe this equation is just modeling the valence band with a parabolic dispersion relation around its maximum. So the top of the valence band is at k=0, and as k increases, the energy becomes more negative. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the velocity of an electron in a crystal is given by the group velocity, which is the derivative of the energy with respect to k. The formula is v = (1/ħ) dE/dk. Since the hole is the absence of an electron, its velocity should be opposite to the velocity of the electron that would have been there. So if the electron's velocity is v_e, the hole's velocity v_h should be -v_e. \n\nLet me verify that. When an electron is missing from a state with velocity v_e, the hole's velocity is considered to be in the opposite direction. So yes, v_h = -v_e. \n\nSo first, let's compute the velocity of the electron at k₁. Given E = -A k², where A is 1×10⁻³⁷ J. So dE/dk = -2 A k. Then the group velocity v_e = (1/ħ) * dE/dk = (1/ħ)(-2 A k). Therefore, v_e = -2 A k / ħ. \n\nThen the hole's velocity is v_h = -v_e = 2 A k / ħ. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers. Let me note the constants:\n\nA = 1×10⁻³⁷ J\n\nk₁ = 1×10⁹ m⁻¹\n\nħ is the reduced Planck constant. I need to remember its value. Planck constant h ≈ 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s, so ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s. \n\nSo let me compute 2*A*k₁ / ħ.\n\nFirst compute numerator: 2 * 1×10⁻³⁷ J * 1×10⁹ m⁻¹ = 2×10⁻²⁸ J·m⁻¹.\n\nWait, units: J is kg·m²/s². So J·m⁻¹ is kg·m/s². Divided by ħ which is J·s, so overall units would be (kg·m/s²) / (J·s) = (kg·m/s²) / (kg·m²/s² · s) )? Wait let me check:\n\nWait, let's check units again. The numerator is 2*A*k₁, which has units of J * m⁻¹? Wait, A is J, k is m⁻¹, so A*k is J/m? Wait no:\n\nWait E has units of J, and A is J, so A*k² must have units of J. Therefore, A must have units of J/m²? Wait hold on, original equation is E = -A k², so units of A must be J/m²? Wait if k is in m⁻¹, then k² is m⁻². Therefore, A must have units of J·m² so that A*k² has units of J. Wait that's correct. So A is 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m². Wait the original question says \"E = -1×10⁻³⁷ k² (J)\", so maybe they just omitted the units for A? So actually, A is -1×10⁻³⁷ J·m²? Wait no, the equation is E = -1×10⁻³⁷ k². If k is in m⁻¹, then k² is m⁻². Therefore, the coefficient must have units of J·m² to make E in J. Therefore, A = 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m². So I think I made a mistake earlier when I said A is 1×10⁻³⁷ J. Actually, A is 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m². Therefore, when taking derivative dE/dk, it's -2 A k, with A in J·m², k in m⁻¹, so the derivative has units of J·m² * m⁻¹ = J·m. Wait, but dE/dk should have units of J/m? Wait no, E is in J, k is in m⁻¹, so dE/dk has units of J·m. Wait, because derivative of E (J) with respect to k (m⁻¹) is J/(m⁻¹) = J·m. Then multiplying by 1/ħ (which is 1/(J·s)) gives velocity units? Let me check:\n\nv = (1/ħ) * dE/dk. \n\nSo units of dE/dk is J·m. Units of ħ is J·s. Therefore, v has units (J·m)/(J·s) ) = m/s. Correct. So that works.\n\nSo going back, let me recast the calculation with correct units. \n\nA = 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m²\n\nk₁ = 1×10⁹ m⁻¹\n\nSo numerator: 2*A*k₁ = 2 * 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m² * 1×10⁹ m⁻¹ = 2×10⁻²⁸ J·m\n\nħ ≈ 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nTherefore, velocity v_h = (2×10⁻²⁸ J·m) / (1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s) ) = (2 / 1.055) × 10⁶ m/s ≈ 1.896 × 10⁶ m/s\n\nWait, let me compute 2 / 1.055 first. 1.055 × 1.89 ≈ 2? Let me do 2 / 1.055. Let me calculate:\n\n1.055 × 1.89 = 1.055 * 1.8 + 1.055 * 0.09 ≈ 1.899 + 0.09495 ≈ 1.99395 ≈ 2. So approximately 1.896. So approximately 1.896 × 10⁶ m/s. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\n2 / 1.055 ≈ 1.896. Yes. So approximately 1.896 × 10⁶ m/s. \n\nBut let me check if I did the exponents correctly. 10⁻²⁸ divided by 10⁻³⁴ is 10⁶. Correct. So yes, 2×10⁻²⁸ / 1.055×10⁻³⁴ ≈ 1.896×10⁶ m/s. \n\nSo the velocity of the hole is approximately 1.9 ×10⁶ m/s. \n\nBut wait, let me check again the formula. The hole velocity is 2 A k / ħ? Wait, original formula:\n\nv_e = (1/ħ) * dE/dk. \n\ndE/dk = -2 A k. \n\nTherefore, v_e = -2 A k / ħ. \n\nTherefore, hole velocity v_h = -v_e = 2 A k / ħ. \n\nYes, so that's correct. So with the numbers plugged in, that gives us ~1.896×10⁶ m/s. \n\nBut let me check if there is something wrong here. The energy is E = -A k². The curvature of the band is given by the second derivative of E with respect to k, which is d²E/dk² = -2 A. In semiconductor physics, the effective mass is given by 1/m* = ħ²/(d²E/dk²). Wait, the formula is:\n\nThe effective mass is given by:\n\n1/m* = (ħ² / (d²E/dk²))\n\nBut here, d²E/dk² = -2 A. Therefore,\n\n1/m* = ħ² / (-2 A) => m* = - ħ²/(2 A)\n\nBut since the effective mass is negative here, which is typical for the valence band. However, when considering holes, the effective mass of the hole is positive and equal to the absolute value of the electron's effective mass. \n\nBut how does this relate to the velocity? Alternatively, the velocity of the hole can be related to the effective mass. But since we already derived the velocity via group velocity, maybe that's sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, if we think of the hole's effective mass, m_h* = -m_e*, and since the velocity is related to the derivative of energy, but maybe we don't need to go that route here. \n\nBut just to check consistency, let me compute the effective mass. \n\nFrom above, m* = - ħ²/(2 A). Let me compute that. \n\nA = 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m². \n\nħ² = (1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s)² ≈ 1.113×10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²\n\nTherefore, m* = - (1.113×10⁻⁶⁸) / (2 * 1×10⁻³⁷) ) kg·m²/s²? Wait, units?\n\nWait, let's check units. The effective mass should have units of kg. Let me check:\n\nThe numerator is ħ² which has units (J²·s²). Denominator is 2 A, which has units J·m². Therefore, overall units:\n\n(J²·s²) / (J·m²) ) = J·s² / m². \n\nBut J is kg·m²/s². Therefore:\n\n(kg·m²/s² * s² / m²) ) = kg. Correct. \n\nSo m* = - ħ²/(2 A). \n\nSo plugging numbers:\n\nm* ≈ - (1.113×10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (2 * 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m²) ) \n\n= - (1.113×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2×10⁻³⁷ ) * (J·s² / m²) \n\nBut J is kg·m²/s², so substituting:\n\n= - (1.113×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2×10⁻³⁷ ) * ( (kg·m²/s²) · s² / m² ) \n\n= - (1.113×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2×10⁻³⁷ ) * kg \n\nCalculating the coefficient:\n\n1.113 / 2 ≈ 0.5565\n\nExponent: 10⁻⁶⁸ / 10⁻³⁷ = 10⁻³¹\n\nTherefore, m* ≈ - 0.5565 × 10⁻³¹ kg ≈ -5.565 × 10⁻³² kg\n\nCompare that to the free electron mass, which is ~9.11×10⁻³¹ kg. So the effective mass here is about -0.061 times the free electron mass. So a very light effective mass, negative. \n\nThen, the velocity of the hole can also be calculated using the relation v = (1/m_h*) * p, where p is the momentum. But since the hole has positive effective mass, but how does that relate to the group velocity? Maybe it's more straightforward to stick with the previous calculation. \n\nBut in any case, since we already calculated the velocity via group velocity, and got ~1.9×10⁶ m/s, which seems reasonable. Let me check with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, the velocity of the hole is related to the derivative of the hole's energy with respect to its crystal momentum. However, since the hole is the absence of an electron, the hole's crystal momentum is opposite to that of the electron. So if the electron has momentum ħk, the hole has momentum -ħk. But I need to be careful here. \n\nIn semiconductor physics, the crystal momentum of a hole is defined as p_h = -p_e. Therefore, if the electron has crystal momentum ħk, the hole has crystal momentum -ħk. \n\nBut the energy of the hole would be related to the energy of the electron. If the electron energy is E_e = -A k², then the hole energy E_h is measured from the top of the valence band. Wait, if the top of the valence band is at E = 0 (for simplicity), then removing an electron from E = -A k² would create a hole with energy E_h = A k². But maybe that's complicating things. \n\nBut if we consider the hole's energy, then E_h = -E_e (if we set the top of the valence band as zero). But regardless, the group velocity of the hole would be the derivative of its energy with respect to its crystal momentum. \n\nAssuming that the hole's crystal momentum is p_h = -ħk, then let's express E_h as a function of p_h. \n\nIf E_e = -A k², then E_h = -E_e = A k². Since p_h = -ħk => k = -p_h / ħ. Therefore, E_h = A (p_h² / ħ²). Therefore, the group velocity of the hole is v_h = dE_h / dp_h = 2 A p_h / ħ². \n\nBut p_h = -ħk, so substituting:\n\nv_h = 2 A (-ħk) / ħ² = - 2 A k / ħ. \n\nWait, but earlier we had v_h = 2 A k / ħ. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct? \n\nHmm. According to this approach, the hole's velocity is -2 A k / ħ, whereas previously we had v_h = 2 A k / ħ. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check again. \n\nEarlier approach: hole velocity is opposite of electron velocity. \n\nElectron velocity: v_e = (1/ħ) dE_e/dk = (1/ħ)(-2 A k) = -2 A k / ħ. Therefore, hole velocity v_h = -v_e = 2 A k / ħ. \n\nBut in the second approach, using hole's energy and momentum, we get v_h = -2 A k / ħ. \n\nThese two results contradict. There must be a mistake in one of the reasonings. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nIf the hole's crystal momentum is p_h = -p_e = -ħk, then the hole's energy is E_h = A k². \n\nExpress E_h in terms of p_h: since p_h = -ħk => k = -p_h / ħ. Therefore, E_h = A (p_h² / ħ²). \n\nThen, group velocity is dE_h/dp_h = 2 A p_h / ħ². \n\nSubstituting p_h = -ħk:\n\ndE_h/dp_h = 2 A (-ħk)/ ħ² = -2 A k / ħ. \n\nBut according to this, the hole's velocity is -2 A k / ħ. However, previously, we thought hole's velocity is opposite to electron's velocity, which was -2 A k / ħ, so hole's velocity would be +2 A k / ħ. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check standard semiconductor theory. \n\nIn semiconductor physics, the hole velocity is given by v_h = (1/ħ) dE_h/dk_h, where k_h is the hole's wave vector. However, the relation between the hole's k and the electron's k is such that k_h = -k_e. \n\nAssuming that the hole's energy E_h is measured from the top of the valence band, and if the electron energy is E_e = E_v - (1/2) ħ² k² / m* (for example), then E_h = (1/2) ħ² k² / m*. But in our case, the given energy is E_e = -A k². If we take the top of the valence band as E = 0, then E_e = -A k² implies that the hole energy would be E_h = A k². \n\nThen, if we define the hole's wave vector k_h = -k_e, then E_h = A k_h². Therefore, the group velocity of the hole is v_h = (1/ħ) dE_h/dk_h = (1/ħ)(2 A k_h) = 2 A k_h / ħ. \n\nBut since k_h = -k_e, and in our case, the electron was removed from k_e = k₁, so the hole has k_h = -k₁. Therefore, substituting into v_h:\n\nv_h = 2 A (-k₁)/ ħ = -2 A k₁ / ħ. \n\nBut according to the previous approach where hole velocity is -v_e, since v_e = -2 A k₁ / ħ, then v_h = 2 A k₁ / ħ. \n\nNow there is a contradiction. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's think physically. If an electron has a certain velocity, the hole should have velocity opposite to that. Let's take an example. Suppose the electron is moving to the right (positive velocity), then the hole should move to the left (negative velocity). \n\nBut according to the first approach, if v_e is negative (from our calculation), then v_h is positive. According to the second approach, v_h is negative. \n\nWait let's check the direction. Let me consider the electron's velocity. \n\nGiven E = -A k². Let's take derivative dE/dk = -2 A k. Then v_e = (1/ħ) dE/dk = -2 A k / ħ. \n\nSo if k is positive, then v_e is negative. So an electron with positive k has negative velocity. Which means it's moving in the negative direction. \n\nBut in a crystal, the relationship between k and velocity isn't always intuitive because of the periodic potential. However, in a free electron model, positive k corresponds to positive velocity. But here, because of the negative sign in the energy, it's inverted. \n\nSo if an electron is at positive k, it has negative velocity. Therefore, if you remove that electron, the hole would have velocity opposite to the electron's velocity. So if the electron's velocity is negative, the hole's velocity is positive. Therefore, v_h = +2 A k / ħ. \n\nBut according to the second approach, using the hole's wave vector k_h = -k, and calculating v_h = 2 A k_h / ħ = -2 A k / ħ. Which is negative. Contradiction. \n\nWhat is the problem here? \n\nAh! I think the issue is in how the hole's energy is defined. If the hole's energy is E_h = A k_h², then taking derivative with respect to k_h gives dE_h/dk_h = 2 A k_h, so v_h = (1/ħ) dE_h/dk_h = 2 A k_h / ħ. \n\nBut if k_h = -k_e, then v_h = 2 A (-k_e)/ ħ. But the electron's velocity is v_e = -2 A k_e / ħ. Therefore, v_h = + v_e. Which contradicts the expectation that v_h = -v_e. \n\nThis suggests an error in the assumption. \n\nWait, maybe the hole's energy is not E_h = -E_e? Maybe there's more to it. \n\nIn reality, the hole's energy is not simply the negative of the electron's energy. It's more nuanced. The hole's energy is measured from the top of the valence band. If the electron is removed from a state at energy E_e (relative to some reference), the hole's energy is such that the total energy change is -E_e. However, the velocity of the hole is determined by how the energy of the hole varies with its wave vector. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mistake is in the relation between the hole's k and the electron's k. In some conventions, the hole's k is the same as the electron's k, but with the effective mass positive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the effective mass approach. \n\nThe effective mass of the electron is m* = -ħ²/(2 A). Then, the velocity of the electron is v_e = (1/ħ) dE/dk = -2 A k / ħ. \n\nBut also, velocity can be expressed as v_e = ħ k / m*. Let me check this relation. \n\nIn general, for a free particle, v = p/m = ħk / m. In semiconductor physics, with effective mass, it's v = ħ k / m*. \n\nLet me check if this holds here. \n\nGiven m* = -ħ²/(2 A). Then, ħ k / m* = ħ k / [ -ħ²/(2 A) ] = - 2 A k / ħ. Which matches the previous result for v_e. \n\nTherefore, v_e = ħ k / m* = -2 A k / ħ. \n\nSo that's consistent. \n\nNow, for the hole, the effective mass is positive, m_h* = |m*| = ħ²/(2 A). \n\nAssuming that the hole's wave vector is the same as the electron's wave vector? Or is it opposite? \n\nThis is the crux of the problem. In some references, the hole's wave vector is considered to be the same as the electron's wave vector from which it was removed. However, because the effective mass is positive, the velocity would be in the opposite direction. \n\nWait, if the hole has effective mass m_h* = +ħ²/(2 A), and if its wave vector is the same as the electron's, then its velocity would be v_h = ħ k / m_h* = ħ k / [ ħ²/(2 A) ] = 2 A k / ħ. Which is the same as the previous result where v_h = -v_e. Since v_e = -2 A k / ħ, then v_h = +2 A k / ħ = -v_e. \n\nTherefore, if we take the hole's wave vector as the same as the electron's, and use the positive effective mass, we get the correct result. \n\nBut why is the hole's wave vector the same as the electron's? In some treatments, the hole's k is considered to be the same as the electron's k because when you remove an electron from a state with k, the hole is said to have that same k. However, because the effective mass is positive, the velocity ends up being in the opposite direction. \n\nAlternatively, if you consider the hole's k to be -k_e, then with positive effective mass, you get v_h = ħ (-k_e) / m_h* = - ħ k_e / m_h*. But since m_h* = +ħ²/(2 A), this would be - ħ k_e / [ ħ²/(2 A) ] = - 2 A k_e / ħ. Which is same as v_e. Which would mean v_h = v_e, which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to take the hole's k as same as the electron's k, and with positive effective mass, giving v_h = +2 A k / ħ = -v_e. \n\nTherefore, the earlier second approach had an error in assuming k_h = -k_e. It should instead keep k_h = k_e, and adjust the effective mass sign. \n\nTherefore, going back, our initial calculation was correct: v_h = 2 A k / ħ ≈ 1.896×10⁶ m/s. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 1.9×10⁶ m/s. Let me check the exact calculation again. \n\nGiven:\n\nA = 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m²\n\nk = 1×10⁹ m⁻¹\n\nħ = 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nv_h = 2 * A * k / ħ = 2 * 1e-37 * 1e9 / 1.055e-34 \n\nCalculating numerator: 2 * 1e-37 * 1e9 = 2e-28 \n\nDenominator: 1.055e-34 \n\nSo 2e-28 / 1.055e-34 ≈ (2 / 1.055) * 1e6 ≈ 1.896 * 1e6 ≈ 1.896×10⁶ m/s \n\nRounded to two decimal places, maybe 1.90×10⁶ m/s. Depending on significant figures. The given values are A = 1×10⁻³⁷ (one significant figure?), k₁ = 1×10⁹ (also one significant figure?), but maybe they are considered exact? The problem says \"calculate the velocity\", so maybe we can present it as approximately 1.9×10⁶ m/s. \n\nBut let me check if I have any miscalculations in exponents. \n\nA is 1e-37 J·m². \n\nk is 1e9 m⁻¹. \n\nMultiply A and k: 1e-37 * 1e9 = 1e-28 J·m. \n\nMultiply by 2: 2e-28 J·m. \n\nDivide by ħ (1.055e-34 J·s): \n\n(2e-28 J·m) / (1.055e-34 J·s) ) = (2 / 1.055) * (1e-28 / 1e-34) * (J·m / J·s) ) \n\n= approx 1.896 * 1e6 * (m/s) \n\nYes, correct. \n\nSo the velocity is approximately 1.896×10⁶ m/s. Depending on the precision required, maybe we can write it as 1.9×10⁶ m/s. \n\nBut let me check if there is any other factor I missed. For example, in some cases, the hole's velocity might have a different factor, but according to the derivation, since hole velocity is -v_e, and v_e was negative, then v_h is positive with magnitude 2 A k / ħ. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about units again. \n\nA is 1e-37 J·m². \n\nk is 1e9 1/m. \n\nSo A*k² is 1e-37 * (1e9)^2 = 1e-37 * 1e18 = 1e-19 J. Wait, but the given E is -1e-37 k². Wait, if k is 1e9 m⁻¹, then E = -1e-37*(1e9)^2 = -1e-37*1e18 = -1e-19 J. \n\nBut the energy is negative, which is fine for the valence band. \n\nBut how does that relate to velocity? \n\nBut we already did the calculation, so I think it's correct. \n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the hole's velocity is approximately 1.9×10⁶ m/s. \n\nBut let me check with exact numbers. \n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.055 exactly. \n\n1.055 × 1.89 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.055 × 1.89:\n\nFirst compute 1 × 1.89 = 1.89\n\nThen 0.05 × 1.89 = 0.0945\n\nThen 0.005 × 1.89 = 0.00945\n\nAdding up: 1.89 + 0.0945 = 1.9845 + 0.00945 = 1.99395. So 1.055 × 1.89 ≈ 1.994, which is very close to 2. Therefore, 2 / 1.055 ≈ 1.894. \n\nTherefore, more accurately, it's approximately 1.894 × 10⁶ m/s. \n\nIf I want to be more precise, using calculator-like computation:\n\nLet me take ħ as 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ J·s (more precise value). \n\nSo let me use ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. \n\nCompute 2e-28 / 1.0545718e-34 \n\n= 2 / 1.0545718 × 1e6 \n\n≈ 1.897 × 1e6 m/s. \n\nSo approximately 1.897×10⁶ m/s. \n\nDepending on how precise we need to be, but since the given values are in one significant figure (A = 1×10⁻³⁷, k = 1×10⁹), maybe we should present it with one significant figure, which would be 2×10⁶ m/s. However, sometimes problems expect you to ignore significant figures and just compute with the given numbers as exact. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \n\nIt says \"calculate the velocity of the hole\". The given values are A = -1×10⁻³⁷ k² (but actually A is 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m²), and k₁ = 1×10⁹ m⁻¹. If these are considered exact, then we can compute the precise value. \n\nBut since in the problem statement, the energy is written as E = -1×10⁻³⁷ k² (J). So they probably intended A to be 1×10⁻³⁷ J·m², and k is given as 1×10⁹ m⁻¹. So we can take those numbers as exact for the purpose of calculation. \n\nTherefore, using ħ ≈ 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ J·s, the precise calculation is:\n\nv_h = (2 * 1e-37 J·m² * 1e9 m⁻¹) / 1.0545718e-34 J·s \n\n= (2e-28 J·m) / 1.0545718e-34 J·s \n\n= 2 / 1.0545718 * 1e6 m/s \n\n≈ 1.897 * 1e6 m/s \n\n≈ 1.897 × 10⁶ m/s \n\nRounded to three decimal places, 1.897×10⁶ m/s. Depending on what's expected, maybe two decimal places, so 1.90×10⁶ m/s. \n\nAlternatively, if they want an exact fraction, but since it's physics, decimal is fine. \n\nSo the answer is approximately 1.9×10⁶ m/s. \n\nBut let me check once more for any miscalculations. \n\nYes, all steps seem correct. The key was recognizing that hole velocity is opposite to electron velocity, which required careful consideration of the definitions. Initially, there was confusion when using the hole's wave vector, but upon re-examining the effective mass approach and the relation v = ħk/m*, it became clear that taking the same k for the hole and positive effective mass gives the correct result. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be approximately 1.9×10⁶ m/s. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe velocity of the hole is \\boxed{1.9 \\times 10^6}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}.\n</think>"}
