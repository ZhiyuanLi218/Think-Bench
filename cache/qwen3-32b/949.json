Alice and Bob alternate turns, with each flipping a fair coin. The game ends when either Alice flips heads (Alice wins) or Bob flips tails (Bob wins).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Define the Probability\n\nLet $ P $ denote the probability that **Alice wins the game**. Since Alice goes first, she immediately has a $ \\frac{1}{2} $ chance of flipping heads and winning.\n\nIf she flips tails (also with probability $ \\frac{1}{2} $), the turn passes to Bob. Bob then has a $ \\frac{1}{2} $ chance of flipping tails and winning. If Bob flips heads (also $ \\frac{1}{2} $), the game returns to Alice, and the situation is identical to the beginning.\n\nTherefore, the game has a recursive nature. We can express $ P $ as:\n\n$$\nP = \\text{Alice wins on first turn} + \\text{Game continues to Alice again} \\times P\n$$\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Alice wins on her first turn with probability $ \\frac{1}{2} $\n- The game continues to Bob with probability $ \\frac{1}{2} $\n- Bob then has a $ \\frac{1}{2} $ chance of winning, and a $ \\frac{1}{2} $ chance of flipping heads, returning the turn to Alice.\n\nSo, the game returns to Alice with probability:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nThis leads to the recursive equation:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}P\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Equation\n\n$$\nP - \\frac{1}{4}P = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{3}{4}P = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Alternative Confirmation via Infinite Series\n\nAnother way to look at this is by considering all the scenarios in which Alice can win:\n\n- Alice wins on the first turn: $ \\frac{1}{2} $\n- Alice and Bob both fail, then Alice wins on her second turn: $ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} $\n- Both fail twice, then Alice wins: $ \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{32} $\n- And so on...\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with first term $ \\frac{1}{2} $ and common ratio $ \\frac{1}{4} $:\n\n$$\nP = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^n = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe probability that Alice wins the game is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns flipping a coin. Alice goes first. If she gets heads, she wins immediately. If she gets tails, then Bob gets to flip. If Bob gets tails, he wins; if he gets heads, then it goes back to Alice, and so on. I need to find the probability that Alice wins the game. Hmm, let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when dealing with probabilities of games like this, especially ones that can theoretically go on indefinitely, we often use recursive equations or infinite series. Maybe I can model this with recursion. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote the probability that Alice wins the game as P. Since Alice starts first, she has an initial chance to win right away. The coin is fair, I assume? Wait, the problem didn't specify if the coin is fair. Hmm. Wait, actually, the problem didn't mention anything about the coin's bias. Hmm. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I should assume it's a fair coin? Because otherwise, the probability would depend on the bias. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Alice flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn.\" It doesn't specify if the coin is fair or not. Wait, maybe the coin is fair? Maybe I need to assume that? Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable as stated. Let me assume that the coin is fair, so probability of heads or tails is 1/2 each. Maybe that's the intended assumption here.\n\nSo, assuming a fair coin, each flip has probability 1/2 of heads and 1/2 of tails. Now, let's think about the game. Alice goes first. She has a 1/2 chance to flip heads and win immediately. If she flips tails (probability 1/2), then Bob gets to flip. Bob then has a 1/2 chance to flip tails and win. If Bob flips heads (probability 1/2), then it goes back to Alice, and the situation is the same as the start. So, the game kind of resets.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Alice wins can be thought of as the probability she wins on her first turn, plus the probability the game gets back to Alice's turn again multiplied by the probability she wins from there.\n\nSo, mathematically, let me define P as the probability that Alice wins. Then:\n\nP = Probability Alice wins on her first turn + Probability game gets back to Alice's turn * P\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nProbability Alice wins on her first turn is 1/2.\n\nProbability the game gets back to Alice's turn is the probability Alice flips tails (1/2) times the probability Bob flips heads (1/2), so (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\nP = 1/2 + (1/4)*P\n\nThen solving for P:\n\nP - (1/4)P = 1/2\n\n(3/4)P = 1/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 4/3:\n\nP = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3.\n\nWait, so is the probability that Alice wins 2/3? Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this with states. Let me think.\n\nFirst, when it's Alice's turn, let's call that State A. When it's Bob's turn, State B.\n\nIn State A, Alice flips the coin. With probability 1/2, she gets heads and wins (so probability of Alice winning from here is 1). With probability 1/2, she gets tails, moving to State B.\n\nIn State B, Bob flips the coin. With probability 1/2, he gets tails and wins (so probability of Alice winning from here is 0). With probability 1/2, he gets heads, moving back to State A.\n\nSo, let me define P_A as the probability Alice wins starting from State A (which is what we want), and P_B as the probability Alice wins starting from State B.\n\nWe can write the equations:\n\nP_A = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*P_B\n\nP_B = (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*P_A\n\nSo substituting P_B into the first equation.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\nP_B = (1/2)*P_A\n\nSubstituting into first equation:\n\nP_A = 1/2 + (1/2)*(1/2 * P_A) = 1/2 + (1/4) P_A\n\nWhich gives:\n\nP_A - (1/4) P_A = 1/2 => (3/4) P_A = 1/2 => P_A = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3.\n\nSame result as before. So that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the probability Alice wins is 2/3. But let me check another way, maybe using infinite series.\n\nAnother approach: think about all the possible ways Alice can win.\n\nAlice can win on the first turn, or if both she and Bob fail on their first attempts, then Alice wins on her second turn, etc.\n\nSo, the probability Alice wins can be expressed as:\n\nP = P(Alice wins on first turn) + P(Alice loses first, Bob loses first, Alice wins on second turn) + P(Alice loses first, Bob loses first, Alice loses second, Bob loses second, Alice wins third turn) + ... etc.\n\nSo, breaking that down:\n\nFirst term: 1/2.\n\nSecond term: (1/2 * 1/2) * 1/2 = (1/4) * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nWait, why? Because Alice loses (1/2), Bob loses (1/2), then Alice wins (1/2). But wait, no. Wait, after Alice loses and Bob loses, it goes back to Alice's turn. So, the second term is the probability that the game goes back to Alice's turn once, then she wins. The probability that the game goes back to Alice's turn once is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4, as before, then multiplied by 1/2 chance she wins. So total 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, the third term would be the game going through two full cycles: Alice loses, Bob loses, Alice loses, Bob loses, then Alice wins. The probability is (1/4)^2 * 1/2 = 1/16 * 1/2 = 1/32? Wait, no. Wait, each cycle (Alice and Bob both failing) is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4. Then, after n cycles, Alice wins on her nth turn. So, the probability is sum_{n=0}^\\infty (1/4)^n * 1/2.\n\nWait, because for each n, the game goes through n cycles (each cycle being Alice and Bob both not winning) and then Alice wins on her (n+1)th turn. Each cycle has probability 1/4, as Alice must flip tails (1/2) and Bob must flip heads (1/2). Wait, hold on, no. Wait, if we think of a cycle as both Alice and Bob taking a turn without someone winning, then for the game to continue, Alice must flip tails (prob 1/2) and then Bob must flip heads (prob 1/2). So yes, the probability of continuing to the next round is 1/4. Then, after n such cycles, Alice has probability 1/2 to win on her turn.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is sum_{n=0}^\\infty (1/4)^n * 1/2.\n\nWhich is a geometric series with first term a = 1/2 and common ratio r = 1/4.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3. Same result. So that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method—recursive equations, states, or infinite series—the probability that Alice wins is 2/3. Therefore, the answer should be 2/3.\n\nBut let me just check once more for errors. Let me think of another approach. Suppose we simulate the game for a few steps and see if the probabilities add up.\n\nFirst, Alice has a 1/2 chance to win immediately. If she doesn't (1/2), Bob has a 1/2 chance to win. So the chance Bob wins on his first turn is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4. Then, if Bob doesn't win (which is another 1/2 chance after Alice's first tail and Bob's first head), it goes back to Alice. So after two turns, the game is back to Alice's turn with probability 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. Then the situation is the same as the start. Therefore, the total probability Alice wins is 1/2 + 1/4 * P, leading to P = 1/2 + 1/4 P, which again gives P = 2/3. Yep, same equation.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the probability that Alice wins as the sum over all possible numbers of rounds. For example:\n\n- Probability Alice wins on first round: 1/2.\n\n- Probability Alice wins on second round: Probability game gets back to her after one full cycle (Alice tails, Bob heads) times 1/2. Which is (1/2 * 1/2) * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\n- Probability Alice wins on third round: (1/4)^2 * 1/2 = 1/16 * 1/2 = 1/32? Wait, no. Wait, each cycle is 1/4, so after two cycles, it's (1/4)^2, then Alice wins, which is 1/2. Wait, so each term is (1/4)^{n} * 1/2 where n is the number of prior cycles. For the first term, n=0: (1/4)^0 * 1/2 = 1/2. Second term n=1: 1/4 * 1/2. Third term n=2: (1/4)^2 * 1/2, etc. Therefore, the total sum is 1/2 * sum_{n=0}^\\infty (1/4)^n = 1/2 * [1 / (1 - 1/4)] = 1/2 * 4/3 = 2/3. Yep, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using expectation or other methods, but since we have consistent results across different methods, I think 2/3 is solid.\n\nBut let me think if there is a possibility that I made an assumption that isn't valid. For example, assuming the coin is fair. The problem didn't specify, but since it's a standard coin flip problem without any mention of bias, it's safe to assume fairness. If the coin wasn't fair, say probability p of heads for Alice and q of tails for Bob, the problem would be more complex, but since it's not mentioned, 1/2 is standard.\n\nAnother check: Intuitively, Alice has the first move advantage. Since she can win immediately, whereas Bob only gets a chance if Alice fails. So, intuitively, Alice should have a higher chance than Bob. Since the game is symmetric in some way but with Alice going first. The result 2/3 for Alice and 1/3 for Bob makes sense. Because if you think about each \"cycle\", the probability that Alice wins before the cycle is 1/2, Bob wins in the first cycle is 1/4, and then it repeats. So overall, the probabilities are in ratio 1/2 : 1/4 : 1/8 : 1/16... etc. So Alice has twice the probability of Bob in each corresponding term. Hence, overall, Alice's total probability is twice Bob's. Since total probability is 1, Alice has 2/3, Bob 1/3. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if we let Q be the probability that Bob wins, then P + Q = 1. Also, Q is the probability that Alice loses first, then Bob wins. Which is 1/2 * [probability Bob wins from his turn]. When it's Bob's turn, he has a 1/2 chance to win immediately, and 1/2 chance to pass back to Alice. So similar recursive equation for Q:\n\nQ = Probability Alice loses first * [probability Bob wins from his turn]\n\nProbability Alice loses first is 1/2. Let me define Q_B as the probability Bob wins from his turn. Then Q_B = 1/2 + 1/2 * (1 - Q_B)? Wait, no. Wait, when Bob is flipping, he can win with 1/2, or pass back to Alice with 1/2. If it passes back to Alice, then Bob's chance to win is 1 - P, where P is Alice's chance to win from her turn. Wait, but since P + Q = 1, then 1 - P = Q. Therefore:\n\nQ_B = 1/2 + 1/2 * Q\n\nBut Q is the total probability that Bob wins, which is equal to Probability Alice loses first * Q_B = 1/2 * Q_B.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ = 1/2 * [1/2 + 1/2 * Q] = 1/4 + 1/4 Q\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ - 1/4 Q = 1/4 => 3/4 Q = 1/4 => Q = 1/3. Therefore, P = 1 - Q = 2/3. Yep, same result. So that's another way to get there. So that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, all methods point to 2/3. Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that Alice wins the game is \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}}.\n</think>"}
