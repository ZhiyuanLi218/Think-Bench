The options are A, B, C, D. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about redox reactions. In a redox reaction, oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons. The substance that is oxidized is the reducing agent, and the one that is reduced is the oxidizing agent. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the oxidation states of iodine in each compound because iodine is involved in both the reactants and products, which likely means it's undergoing some redox process. Let me start by figuring out the oxidation state of iodine in K₂H₃IO₆. \n\nPotassium (K) has a +1 charge, hydrogen (H) is usually +1, and oxygen is -2. Let me write down the formula: K₂H₃IO₆. Let me denote the oxidation state of iodine as x. \n\nSo, the total charge of the compound should be zero because it's a neutral molecule. \n\nCalculating the oxidation states:\n\nFor K₂H₃IO₆:\n2*(+1) for K + 3*(+1) for H + 1*(x) for I + 6*(-2) for O = 0\n\nSo:\n\n2 + 3 + x - 12 = 0  \n(2 + 3) = 5; 5 + x - 12 = 0 → x - 7 = 0 → x = +7\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of I in K₂H₃IO₆ is +7.\n\nNow, let's look at HI. Hydrogen is +1, so iodine (I) in HI must be -1. \n\nIn the products, KI has K (+1) and I (-1), so iodine is -1 here. \n\nI₂ is elemental iodine, so its oxidation state is 0. \n\nSo, in the reaction, iodine is changing from +7 in K₂H₃IO₆ to -1 in KI and 0 in I₂. Also, HI has I at -1, which might be oxidized or reduced? Wait, HI is acting as a reactant. Let me check all the iodine species involved. \n\nThe reactants have two sources of iodine: K₂H₃IO₆ (I at +7) and HI (I at -1). The products have KI (I at -1) and I₂ (I at 0). \n\nSo, let me think about the redox processes. \n\nFirst, the iodine in K₂H₃IO₆ (oxidation state +7) is going to products where iodine is in KI (-1) and I₂ (0). So, that iodine is being reduced because it's going from +7 to lower oxidation states. \n\nThen, the iodine in HI (oxidation state -1) can be either oxidized or reduced. For example, in the products, some of it becomes I₂ (oxidation state 0), which is oxidation (loss of electrons), and some remains as -1 in KI. \n\nSo, in this reaction, K₂H₃IO₆ is acting as an oxidizing agent because it is being reduced (since it's the species that causes oxidation in another substance). Conversely, HI is acting as a reducing agent because some of its iodine is being oxidized (from -1 to 0 in I₂). \n\nLet me try to write the half-reactions. \n\nFirst, the reduction half-reaction: I in +7 goes to something. Let's see. The I from K₂H₃IO₆ is going to products. Where does it end up? In the products, there is KI and I₂. Let me check the stoichiometry. \n\nThe reaction is: K₂H₃IO₆ + 9 HI → 2 KI + 4 I₂ + 6 H₂O. \n\nSo, on the left, we have 1 I from K₂H₃IO₆ and 9 I from HI, total of 10 I. On the right, we have 2 I from KI and 4*2=8 I from I₂, total of 10 I. So balanced. \n\nNow, the iodine from K₂H₃IO₆ (let's call it I^+7) is going to where? In the products, there is KI (I^-1) and I₂ (I^0). So, perhaps it is being reduced to both I^-1 and I^0? Or maybe there's a specific path. Alternatively, perhaps the I^+7 is reduced to I^-1 and I^0? Wait, but how does that happen? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the I^+7 is reduced to I^0? But there's also I^-1. Hmm. Let me try to figure out the half-reactions. \n\nLet me consider the reduction of I^+7 to something. Let's suppose it's reduced to I^0. Then, the reduction half-reaction would be:\n\nI^+7 + electrons → I^0\n\nSimilarly, the oxidation half-reaction would be I^-1 (from HI) losing electrons to become I^0. \n\nBut also, some of the I^-1 from HI remains as I^-1 in KI. So perhaps part of the HI is oxidized and part is not. \n\nThis seems a bit complex. Let me try to write the half-reactions properly. \n\nFirst, the reduction half-reaction: I in +7 (from K₂H₃IO₆) is reduced. Let's write the formula for that. \n\nThe formula for K₂H₃IO₆ is K2H3IO6. Let me think about the ion here. Probably, the formula can be considered as K2[H3IO6]^-, but maybe it's a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a polyatomic ion. Let me think about the formula. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to write the formula as H3IO6^2-? Since K is +1, so two K would give +2, and the rest would need to be -2. So H3IO6^2-? Let me check the charges. \n\nIf K₂H₃IO₆ is neutral, then the H3IO6 part must be -2. So, H3IO6^2-.\n\nSo, in the reduction half-reaction, H3IO6^2- is being converted into something. Let me write the reduction half-reaction. \n\nAssuming that the I^+7 is being reduced to I^0 (I₂). Let me try:\n\nH3IO6^2- → I₂\n\nBut need to balance this. Let me start. \n\nFirst, balance the iodine. There is 1 I on the left and 2 I on the right. Let me adjust:\n\nH3IO6^2- → I₂\n\nMultiply left side by 2:\n\n2 H3IO6^2- → I₂\n\nNow, balance O by adding H2O. There are 12 O on the left (2*6), so add 12 H2O on the right. \n\n2 H3IO6^2- → I₂ + 12 H2O\n\nNow balance H. On the left, there are 2*3 = 6 H from H3. On the right, there are 12*2 = 24 H from H2O. So total H on right is 24. To balance H, add H+ to the left. \n\nSo, how many H+?\n\nLeft side H: 6 (from H3) + n H+ = right side H: 24. \n\nSo, 6 + n = 24 → n = 18. So add 18 H+ to the left. \n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ → I₂ + 12 H2O\n\nNow, balance the charges. Left side: each H3IO6^2- is -2, so 2*(-2) = -4. 18 H+ is +18. Total charge on left: -4 + 18 = +14. \n\nRight side: I₂ is neutral, H2O is neutral. Total charge is 0. \n\nSo, need to add electrons to the left side to make the charge balance. \n\nLeft side is +14, right is 0. So, need to add 14 electrons to the left to reduce the charge by 14. \n\nSo:\n\n2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 e- → I₂ + 12 H2O\n\nThis is the reduction half-reaction. Each I^+7 is gaining 7 electrons to become I^0 (since 2 I atoms each gaining 7 electrons? Wait, let me check. \n\nOriginal oxidation state of I in H3IO6^2- is +7, as calculated earlier. In I₂, each I is 0. So each I atom gains 7 electrons. Since there are 2 I atoms on the left (from 2 H3IO6^2-), total electrons gained is 2*7=14. Which matches the 14 e- added. So this half-reaction is correct. \n\nNow, the oxidation half-reaction. The HI is providing I^- which is being oxidized to I₂. Let me write that. \n\nHI → I₂\n\nBut HI dissociates into H+ and I^-.\n\nSo, considering I^- is being oxidized to I₂. Let me write:\n\nI^- → I₂\n\nBalance I: 2 I^- → I₂\n\nNow balance charge. Left side: 2*(-1) = -2. Right side: 0. So need to add electrons to the right side (since oxidation is loss of electrons). \n\nSo:\n\n2 I^- → I₂ + 2 e^-\n\nThat's the oxidation half-reaction. \n\nNow, to combine the two half-reactions. The reduction half-reaction has 14 e^-, and the oxidation half-reaction has 2 e^-. To balance electrons, multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 7 so that 14 e^- are lost. \n\nSo:\n\nReduction: 2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 e^- → I₂ + 12 H2O  \nOxidation: 7*(2 I^- → I₂ + 2 e^-) → 14 I^- → 7 I₂ + 14 e^-\n\nNow add both equations:\n\n2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 e^- + 14 I^- → I₂ + 12 H2O + 7 I₂ + 14 e^-\n\nSimplify: the 14 e^- cancels out. \n\nCombine I₂ and 7 I₂ to 8 I₂. \n\nSo:\n\n2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 I^- → 8 I₂ + 12 H2O\n\nNow, let me check if this matches the given reaction. The given reaction is:\n\nK₂H₃IO₆ + 9 HI → 2 KI + 4 I₂ + 6 H₂O\n\nLet me see. Let me adjust the coefficients. The above equation is for 2 H3IO6^2- reacting. Let me check the stoichiometry. \n\nIn the given reaction, the coefficient for K₂H₃IO₆ is 1, and for HI is 9. Let me see if my derived equation can be scaled accordingly. \n\nIn my combined equation, there are 2 H3IO6^2- and 14 I^- (from HI, since each HI gives one I^-). Also, 18 H+ comes from HI dissociation? Wait, HI is a strong acid, so HI → H+ + I^-. \n\nSo, in the overall reaction, the H+ comes from HI. Let me check. \n\nIn the combined equation, we have 18 H+ and 14 I^-. Since each HI provides one H+ and one I^-, so the total number of HI would be 18 H+ +14 I^- = 32 HI? Wait, no. Wait, if you have 18 H+ and 14 I^-, but each HI gives one H+ and one I^-. However, in reality, the H+ and I^- may come from different sources. Wait, but in the reaction, the H+ is coming from HI. Let me think. \n\nBut in the reaction given, the HI is a reactant. So, in the overall equation, the H+ and I^- are from HI. However, in the combined equation, we have 18 H+ and 14 I^-. So that would correspond to 18 HI molecules providing H+ and I^-, but we also have 14 I^-. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the oxidation half-reaction, the I^- comes from HI. Each HI gives one I^-. The 14 I^- in the oxidation half-reaction would come from 14 HI. Also, the 18 H+ would come from HI as well? But each HI gives one H+ and one I^-. So, if we have 14 I^- from 14 HI, and 18 H+ from HI, but each HI gives one H+, so to get 18 H+, we need 18 HI. However, that would mean that total HI is 14 + 18 = 32? But that's not matching the given reaction. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check the stoichiometry again. Let me look at the given reaction:\n\n1 K₂H₃IO₆ + 9 HI → 2 KI + 4 I₂ + 6 H₂O\n\nLet me count the I atoms. On the left: 1 (from K₂H₃IO₆) + 9 (from HI) = 10 I. On the right: 2 (from KI) + 4*2=8 (from I₂) = 10 I. So balanced. \n\nIn my derived equation from the half-reactions, after combining, we have:\n\n2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 I^- → 8 I₂ + 12 H2O\n\nBut in the given reaction, the stoichiometry is 1 K₂H₃IO₆ and 9 HI. Let me see if scaling my equation can match. \n\nIf I divide my equation by 2:\n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O\n\nYes! So, if I take half of the combined equation, it becomes:\n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O\n\nNow, in this case, the H3IO6^2- is from K₂H₃IO₆. Also, the H+ and I^- come from HI. Since each HI provides one H+ and one I^-, the total number of HI molecules needed would be the number of H+ plus the number of I^- from the oxidation. Wait, but in this equation, we have 9 H+ and 7 I^- from the left side. However, each HI provides both H+ and I^-. Therefore, if we need 9 H+ and 7 I^-, but each HI gives one H+ and one I^-, then we need 9 HI to provide the 9 H+ and 9 I^-, but we only need 7 I^-. Therefore, there is an excess of 2 I^-? Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the equation H3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O, the 9 H+ and 7 I^- must come from HI. However, each HI provides one H+ and one I^-. So if we need 9 H+ and 7 I^-, we need 9 HI molecules to provide the 9 H+ and 9 I^-, but we only need 7 I^-. Therefore, there are 2 extra I^- which would be on the left side. But in the given reaction, the HI is only 9 molecules. Let me check the given reaction. \n\nOriginal reaction: K₂H₃IO₆ + 9 HI → 2 KI + 4 I₂ + 6 H₂O\n\nSo, on the left: 1 K₂H₃IO₆ and 9 HI. On the right: 2 KI, 4 I₂, 6 H2O. \n\nLet me write the ions involved. K₂H₃IO₆ dissociates into 2 K+ and H3IO6^2-. HI dissociates into H+ and I^-. \n\nSo the left side has 2 K+, H3IO6^2-, 9 H+, and 9 I^-.\n\nOn the right side, 2 KI is 2 K+ and 2 I^-, 4 I₂, and 6 H2O. \n\nSo combining the left side ions:\n\nTotal K+ is 2. \n\nTotal H+ is 9 + from H3IO6? Wait, the H3IO6^2- has 3 H+? Or is it part of the ion? \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to just check the stoichiometry from the half-reaction. \n\nEarlier, after dividing by 2, we had:\n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O\n\nComparing with the given reaction:\n\nK₂H₃IO₆ + 9 HI → 2 KI + 4 I₂ + 6 H₂O\n\nLet me see. The left side of the given reaction has 1 K₂H₃IO₆ and 9 HI. Let me write the ions from these:\n\nK₂H₃IO₆ → 2 K+ + H3IO6^2-\n\nHI → H+ + I^-\n\nSo total from left side:\n\n2 K+ + H3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 9 I^-\n\nOn the right side:\n\n2 KI → 2 K+ + 2 I^-\n\n4 I₂\n\n6 H2O\n\nSo combining the left side ions:\n\nTotal K+ is 2. \n\nTotal H+ is 9. \n\nTotal I^- is 9. \n\nH3IO6^2- is 1. \n\nOn the right side, K+ is 2 (from KI), I^- is 2 (from KI), and 4 I₂. \n\nSo, the equation from the half-reaction is:\n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O + ... ?\n\nBut in reality, on the left side, we have H3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 9 I^-. \n\nComparing to the half-reaction equation, which requires 7 I^-. Therefore, there are 9 I^- on the left, 7 are used in the reaction, and 2 remain as I^- on the right side. Which matches the 2 I^- in 2 KI. \n\nTherefore, the overall reaction can be seen as:\n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O + 2 I^-\n\nWhich, when combined with the 2 K+ from K₂H₃IO₆, gives 2 KI on the right. \n\nTherefore, the given reaction is balanced. \n\nNow, back to the redox analysis. \n\nThe reduction half-reaction: I^+7 → I^0 (in I₂). \n\nThe oxidation half-reaction: I^- → I^0 (in I₂). \n\nSo, in this reaction, the K₂H₃IO₆ is the oxidizing agent (因为它 is being reduced), and HI is acting as the reducing agent (因为它 is being oxidized). \n\nNow, let's check each option. \n\nOption A: K₂H₃IO₆ undergoes an oxidation reaction. \n\nBut oxidation is loss of electrons. However, K₂H₃IO₆ is being reduced (I goes from +7 to 0), so it's undergoing reduction. Therefore, A is incorrect. \n\nOption B: KI is a reduction product. \n\nKI has I^- which is -1. Where does this come from? The I^- in KI comes from HI (which is -1) and not from the reduction of K₂H₃IO₆. Wait, no. Wait, in the half-reaction, we had that some I^- remains as I^- in KI. But where does that I^- come from? It comes from HI. However, the reduction of K₂H₃IO₆ also leads to some I^-? Wait, no. Wait in the overall reaction, the I^- in KI comes from HI. Because the K₂H₃IO₆ is reduced to I₂, and the I^- in KI comes from HI. Wait, but earlier in the half-reaction, we had:\n\nThe combined equation is H3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O + 2 I^-\n\nTherefore, the 2 I^- on the right side comes from the left side's 9 I^-, meaning that 7 I^- are oxidized to I₂, and 2 remain as I^-. Therefore, the I^- in KI comes from the excess HI that wasn't oxidized. Therefore, the KI is not a product of reduction of K₂H₃IO₆, but rather of the unoxidized HI. Therefore, the reduction product is I₂ (from the K₂H₃IO₆ being reduced). Therefore, KI is not a reduction product. Wait, but KI contains I^- which is lower in oxidation state than I₂ (which is 0). But since the I^- comes from HI (which was already -1), it's not a product of reduction. Reduction is when something is reduced. Since the I in HI was already -1, and it remains -1 in KI, there's no reduction there. The reduction is the I^+7 going to 0. Therefore, the reduction products are I₂. The KI is formed from the I^- that was already in HI. Therefore, option B says \"KI is a reduction product\", which is incorrect. Therefore, B is incorrect. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to check again. The KI is formed from K+ from K₂H₃IO₆ and I^- from HI. The K+ is not involved in redox. The I^- in KI comes from HI. Since HI's I is -1, which is not changed. Therefore, KI is not a product of reduction. Therefore, B is incorrect. \n\nOption C: When 12.7 g I₂ is produced, 0.1 mol of electrons are transferred. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of I₂. The molar mass of I₂ is 2*126.9 g/mol ≈ 253.8 g/mol. \n\nGiven 12.7 g I₂. \n\nMolar mass of I is approximately 127 g/mol, so I₂ is 254 g/mol. \n\nSo moles of I₂ = 12.7 g / 254 g/mol ≈ 0.05 mol. \n\nNow, need to find how many moles of electrons are transferred when 0.05 mol of I₂ is produced. \n\nLooking back at the half-reactions. \n\nThe reduction half-reaction: 2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 e^- → I₂ + 12 H2O. Wait, no, earlier we scaled it down. The actual reduction half-reaction per molecule is when we divided by 2: \n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 e^- → (1/2) I₂ + 6 H2O ?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine. \n\nEarlier, the reduction half-reaction (for 2 H3IO6^2-) produced 1 I₂. Wait, no, when we had 2 H3IO6^2- being reduced to I₂. Then, when we divided by 2, it's 1 H3IO6^2- producing 0.5 I₂? Wait, no. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal reduction half-reaction (before scaling):\n\n2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 e^- → I₂ + 12 H2O \n\nSo, per 2 moles of H3IO6^2-, 1 mole of I₂ is produced, and 14 moles of e^- are gained. \n\nTherefore, per mole of I₂, 14/1 = 14 moles of e^- are transferred. \n\nBut wait, also in the oxidation half-reaction, per 7 I₂ produced (from oxidation), 14 e^- are lost. \n\nBut in the overall reaction, how much I₂ is produced? \n\nIn the overall reaction derived from the half-reactions, after scaling, we had 8 I₂ produced. Let me check again. \n\nEarlier, when combining the two half-reactions, the total I₂ was 8. But in the given reaction, it's 4 I₂. \n\nYes, because we divided by 2. \n\nSo in the given reaction, 4 moles of I₂ are produced. \n\nNow, for the electrons transferred. \n\nIn the reduction half-reaction (for producing 1 I₂ from 2 H3IO6^2-), 14 e^- are gained. \n\nIn the oxidation half-reaction, for producing 7 I₂, 14 e^- are lost. \n\nSo overall, in the combined reaction producing 8 I₂, 14 electrons are transferred (since reduction and oxidation are balanced). \n\nBut in the given reaction, which is half of that, producing 4 I₂, then the number of electrons transferred is 7. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nOriginal combined equation (before dividing by 2):\n\n2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 I^- → 8 I₂ + 12 H2O \n\nThis corresponds to 8 moles of I₂ and 14 moles of e^- transferred. \n\nTherefore, per mole of I₂, the electrons transferred would be 14 / 8 = 1.75 moles of e^- per mole of I₂. \n\nBut in the given reaction, 4 moles of I₂ are produced, so electrons transferred would be 14 / 2 = 7 moles? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nIf producing 8 moles of I₂ involves 14 moles of e^-, then producing 4 moles of I₂ would involve 7 moles of e^-. \n\nTherefore, when 4 moles of I₂ are produced, 7 moles of e^- are transferred. \n\nBut the question is about when 12.7 g of I₂ is produced, which is 0.05 mol (as calculated earlier). \n\nSo, if 4 moles I₂ correspond to 7 moles e^-, then 0.05 moles I₂ corresponds to (7/4)*0.05 = 0.0875 moles e^-. \n\nBut the option C says 0.1 mol electrons are transferred. \n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by looking at the oxidation and reduction processes. \n\nIn the reaction, each molecule of K₂H₃IO₆ (which is 1 mole) is reduced, gaining 7 electrons (as per earlier half-reaction: for 1 H3IO6^2-, the reduction half-reaction is:\n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 e^- → 4 I₂? Wait no, earlier we had:\n\nAfter dividing by 2, the equation was H3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O + 2 I^-\n\nWait, but in the half-reactions, the reduction half-reaction for 1 H3IO6^2- would involve gaining 7 e^-. \n\nLet me check again. \n\nOriginal reduction half-reaction (for 2 H3IO6^2-): 2 H3IO6^2- + 18 H+ + 14 e^- → I₂ + 12 H2O \n\nTherefore, per 1 H3IO6^2-, it would be:\n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 e^- → (1/2) I₂ + 6 H2O \n\nBut in reality, in the overall reaction, we have more I₂ produced. \n\nBut perhaps I need to consider the total electrons transferred in the entire reaction. \n\nIn the given reaction, 1 mole of K₂H₃IO₆ reacts with 9 moles of HI to produce 4 moles of I₂. \n\nIn this reaction, how many electrons are transferred? \n\nFrom the half-reactions:\n\nThe reduction half-reaction (for 1 mole of H3IO6^2-): gains 7 e^-\n\nThe oxidation half-reaction: 7 moles of I^- are oxidized to 7/2 moles of I₂ (since 2 I^- → I₂). Wait, no. The oxidation half-reaction was multiplied by 7 to get 14 I^- → 7 I₂. \n\nSo in the overall reaction, 7 moles of I^- are oxidized, losing 7*1 = 7 moles of e^- (since each 2 I^- lose 2 e^- to form 1 I₂). Wait, the oxidation half-reaction is 2 I^- → I₂ + 2 e^-, so per mole of I₂, 2 moles of e^- are lost. \n\nIn the overall reaction, we have 7 I₂ from oxidation. Therefore, electrons lost from oxidation is 7 * 2 = 14 moles? Wait, no. Wait the oxidation half-reaction after multiplying by 7 is 14 I^- → 7 I₂ + 14 e^-. So yes, 14 moles of e^- lost. \n\nThe reduction half-reaction for 1 H3IO6^2- (since in the given reaction we have 1 mole of it) would be gaining 7 e^-. \n\nTherefore, total electrons transferred is 7 moles (from reduction) and 14 moles from oxidation? Wait no, in a balanced redox reaction, the electrons gained and lost should be equal. \n\nAh, right! In the overall reaction, the electrons lost in oxidation must equal the electrons gained in reduction. \n\nSo, in the combined reaction, the reduction half-reaction (for 1 H3IO6^2-) gains 7 e^-, and the oxidation half-reaction loses 14 e^-. Wait, that can't be balanced. \n\nWait earlier, when combining the two half-reactions, we had to multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 7 so that 14 e^- are lost, matching the 14 e^- gained in the reduction half-reaction (original before dividing by 2). \n\nBut when we divided by 2 to get the given reaction, the reduction half-reaction would be gaining 7 e^-, and the oxidation half-reaction would be losing 7 e^-. \n\nWait let me clarify. \n\nOriginal reduction half-reaction (for 2 H3IO6^2-): gains 14 e^-\n\nOriginal oxidation half-reaction (for 14 I^-): loses 14 e^-\n\nCombined, they balance. \n\nThen, when we divide by 2, the reduction half-reaction becomes for 1 H3IO6^2-: gains 7 e^-\n\nThe oxidation half-reaction becomes for 7 I^-: loses 7 e^-\n\nTherefore, in the given reaction (which is this scaled-down version), the total electrons transferred is 7 moles. \n\nTherefore, in the given reaction (1 mole of K₂H₃IO₆ and 9 HI producing 4 I₂), 7 moles of electrons are transferred. \n\nSo, if 4 moles of I₂ correspond to 7 moles of e^-, then 1 mole of I₂ corresponds to 7/4 moles of e^-. \n\nTherefore, 0.05 moles of I₂ would correspond to (7/4)*0.05 = 0.0875 moles of e^-, which is 0.0875 mol ≈ 0.088 mol. \n\nBut option C says 0.1 mol. Therefore, option C is incorrect. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the stoichiometry again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the total electrons transferred in the entire reaction. \n\nIn the given reaction, 1 mole of K₂H₃IO₆ is reduced, gaining 7 moles of e^-, and 7 moles of HI are oxidized (since 7 I^- are oxidized to I₂). \n\nEach oxidation of 2 I^- to 1 I₂ loses 2 e^-. So for 7 I₂, it would be... Wait, the oxidation half-reaction in the given reaction produces 7 I₂? No, in the given reaction, total I₂ produced is 4. \n\nWait, let me go back. \n\nThe given reaction is:\n\nK₂H₃IO₆ + 9 HI → 2 KI + 4 I₂ + 6 H₂O\n\nFrom earlier analysis, in this reaction:\n\n- The reduction half-reaction: 1 mole of I^+7 (from K₂H₃IO₆) is reduced to I^0 (in I₂). How much I₂ is produced from this reduction? \n\nIn the half-reaction, originally, 2 moles of I^+7 produce 1 mole of I₂. But when scaled down to 1 mole of I^+7, it would produce 0.5 moles of I₂. \n\nBut in the given reaction, total I₂ is 4 moles. How much comes from reduction and how much from oxidation? \n\nFrom the combined half-reactions, in the overall reaction, we have:\n\nReduction produces some I₂, and oxidation produces some I₂. \n\nEarlier, when combining the half-reactions, the total I₂ was 8 moles (before dividing by 2). After dividing by 2, it's 4 moles. \n\nIn that case, the 4 moles of I₂ consist of how much from reduction and oxidation? \n\nLooking back at the combined equation:\n\nH3IO6^2- + 9 H+ + 7 I^- → 4 I₂ + 6 H2O + 2 I^-\n\nThis equation shows that the 4 I₂ comes from both the reduction of H3IO6^2- and the oxidation of I^-? Or is there a specific amount? \n\nActually, in the combined half-reactions, the reduction half-reaction produced I₂ and the oxidation half-reaction also produced I₂. \n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the electrons. \n\nIn the given reaction, total electrons transferred is 7 moles (as per earlier). \n\nSo if 7 moles of electrons are transferred, and the question is about 0.05 moles of I₂, then we need to relate moles of I₂ to moles of electrons. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the total electrons transferred per mole of reaction. \n\nIn one mole of reaction (as written), 7 moles of electrons are transferred. And this produces 4 moles of I₂. \n\nTherefore, moles of electrons per mole of I₂ is 7/4. \n\nTherefore, for n moles of I₂, moles of e^- = (7/4) * n. \n\nGiven n = 0.05 mol I₂:\n\nmoles e^- = 7/4 * 0.05 = 0.0875 mol ≈ 0.088 mol. \n\nBut option C says 0.1 mol. So it's not correct. Hence, option C is incorrect. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles of I₂? Let me check again. \n\nGiven mass of I₂ is 12.7 g. \n\nMolar mass of I₂ is 253.8 g/mol. \n\nSo moles = 12.7 / 253.8 ≈ 0.05 mol. Yes. \n\nSo 0.05 mol I₂ corresponds to 0.0875 mol e^-, which is not 0.1. So option C is incorrect. \n\nOption D: The molar ratio of the reducing agent to the oxidizing agent is 7:1. \n\nThe reducing agent is HI (since it's being oxidized), and the oxidizing agent is K₂H₃IO₆ (since it's being reduced). \n\nIn the reaction, the stoichiometric coefficients are 1 mole of K₂H₃IO₆ and 9 moles of HI. \n\nBut not all of the HI is acting as a reducing agent. Because in the reaction, some HI provides H+ and I^- that don't participate in redox. Specifically, in the reaction:\n\nK₂H₃IO₆ + 9 HI → 2 KI + 4 I₂ + 6 H₂O\n\nOut of the 9 HI, how many are acting as reducing agents (i.e., their I^- is being oxidized to I₂), and how many are just providing I^- that ends up in KI? \n\nFrom earlier analysis, in the reaction, 7 I^- are oxidized to I₂, and 2 I^- remain as I^- in KI. Therefore, out of 9 HI, 7 are acting as reducing agents (their I^- is oxidized), and 2 are not (their I^- remains as I^-). \n\nTherefore, the amount of reducing agent (HI) is 7 moles, and the oxidizing agent (K₂H₃IO₆) is 1 mole. \n\nTherefore, the molar ratio of reducing agent to oxidizing agent is 7:1. \n\nTherefore, option D is correct. \n\nSo summarizing:\n\nA: Incorrect (K₂H₃IO₆ is reduced, not oxidized)\n\nB: Incorrect (KI is not a reduction product; I₂ is)\n\nC: Incorrect (0.0875 mol e^- transferred, not 0.1)\n\nD: Correct (7:1 ratio)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \n\nBut wait, let me check again for option B. \n\nOption B says \"KI is a reduction product\". \n\nKI contains I^- which is -1. Where does this I^- come from? It comes from HI, which is -1. Since there is no change in oxidation state, it's not a product of reduction. Reduction is when something is reduced (oxidation state decreases). Since the I in HI is already at -1, and remains at -1 in KI, it's not a reduction product. The reduction product is I₂ (from the I^+7 being reduced to 0). Therefore, B is incorrect. \n\nYes, so D is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
