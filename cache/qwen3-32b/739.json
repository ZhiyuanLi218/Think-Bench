Let me write that down again to make sure I have it right. It's (2/3) = (4)/(x - 5). Alright, so I need to find the value of x that makes this equation true. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a proportion like this, where two fractions are equal to each other, you can cross-multiply to solve for the variable. That means multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and setting them equal. Let me try that here.\n\nSo, if I cross-multiply, that would be 2 times (x - 5) equals 3 times 4. Let me check that again. The left side numerator is 2, and the right side denominator is (x - 5). The right side numerator is 4, and the left side denominator is 3. So yes, cross-multiplying gives 2*(x - 5) = 3*4. \n\nCalculating the right side first, 3 times 4 is 12. So now the equation is 2*(x - 5) = 12. Now I need to solve for x. To do that, I can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. That would give me (x - 5) = 12/2, which simplifies to x - 5 = 6. \n\nThen, to solve for x, I just need to add 5 to both sides. So x = 6 + 5, which is 11. Let me check if that makes sense. If x is 11, then the denominator on the right side of the original equation is 11 - 5, which is 6. So 4 divided by 6 is 2/3, which matches the left side. Wait, 4 divided by 6 simplifies to 2/3? Let me confirm that. \n\nYes, 4 divided by 6 can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 2, which gives 2/3. Perfect, that matches the left side of the equation. So x = 11 is the correct solution. \n\nBut let me go through the steps again just to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake. Starting with 2/3 = 4/(x - 5). Cross-multiplying gives 2*(x - 5) = 3*4. Then 2x - 10 = 12. Wait, hold on, if I distribute the 2 on the left side, it's 2*x minus 2*5, so 2x - 10. Then adding 10 to both sides gives 2x = 22, and then dividing by 2 gives x = 11. Oh, so another way to look at it is distributing first. Either way, I still get x = 11. \n\nSo both methods confirm that x is 11. Let me also check if there's any restriction on x. The original equation has a denominator of (x - 5), so x cannot be 5 because that would make the denominator zero, which is undefined. But since our solution is x = 11, which is not 5, that's fine. So there are no issues with the solution. \n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by manipulating the equation differently? Let's see. Suppose I wanted to isolate x step by step without cross-multiplying. Let me try that. \n\nStarting with 2/3 = 4/(x - 5). If I want to solve for x, maybe I can first multiply both sides of the equation by (x - 5) to get rid of the denominator. Let's try that. \n\nMultiplying both sides by (x - 5) gives (2/3)*(x - 5) = 4. Then, to isolate (x - 5), I can multiply both sides by 3/2. Let me do that. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 3/2: (3/2)*(2/3)*(x - 5) = 4*(3/2). On the left side, the 3/2 and 2/3 cancel each other out, leaving just (x - 5). On the right side, 4 times 3/2 is (4*3)/2 = 12/2 = 6. So again, x - 5 = 6, so x = 11. \n\nSame result. So regardless of the method I use, I end up with x = 11. \n\nAnother check: Let's plug x = 11 back into the original equation and verify both sides are equal. \n\nLeft side: 2/3. \n\nRight side: 4/(11 - 5) = 4/6 = 2/3. \n\nYes, both sides are equal. \n\nWait, maybe I can also think about the relationship between the fractions. The left side is 2/3, and the right side is 4 over something. Since 4 is twice 2, maybe the denominator has to be twice 3? Wait, no, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me see. \n\nIf 2/3 equals 4 divided by something, then since 4 is double 2, to keep the fraction equivalent, the denominator must also be double. But in fractions, if you multiply numerator and denominator by the same number, you get an equivalent fraction. However, here the numerator is multiplied by 2 (from 2 to 4), so if we want to keep the value of the fraction the same, the denominator must also be multiplied by 2. \n\nSo, starting with 2/3, multiply numerator and denominator by 2: (2*2)/(3*2) = 4/6. Therefore, 4/6 is equal to 2/3. Therefore, the denominator must be 6. Therefore, x - 5 = 6, so x = 11. \n\nThat's another way to think about it. Since 2/3 is equivalent to 4/6, so x - 5 must be 6, so x is 11. \n\nSo all methods lead to the same answer. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in cross-multiplying? Let me check that step again. \n\nOriginal equation: 2/3 = 4/(x - 5). Cross-multiplying: 2*(x - 5) = 3*4. \n\nYes, because in proportions, a/b = c/d implies ad = bc. So here, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4, d = (x - 5). Therefore, ad = 2*(x - 5), and bc = 3*4. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother common mistake might be mixing up the numerator and denominator when cross-multiplying, but I don't think I did that here. \n\nAlternatively, someone might incorrectly set 2*4 = 3*(x - 5), but that would be wrong because cross-multiplication is (a*d) = (b*c), not (a*c) = (b*d). So as long as I remember that, it's okay. \n\nSo, 2*(x - 5) = 12. Then solving that gives x - 5 = 6, so x = 11. \n\nAnother possible mistake could be distributing the 2 incorrectly. For example, if I forgot to multiply both terms inside the parentheses. Let me check that step again. \n\n2*(x - 5) = 2*x - 2*5 = 2x - 10. That's correct. If I set that equal to 12, then 2x - 10 = 12. Adding 10 to both sides: 2x = 22. Dividing by 2: x = 11. \n\nYes, that's all correct. \n\nAlternatively, if someone added 10 instead of subtracted or something, they might get a different answer, but I followed the steps correctly. \n\nSo, after multiple checks and different methods, I can confidently say that x = 11 is the correct solution. \n\nJust to recap:\n\nOriginal equation: 2/3 = 4/(x - 5)\n\nCross-multiplying: 2(x - 5) = 12\n\nSolving: x - 5 = 6 => x = 11\n\nCheck: 4/(11 - 5) = 4/6 = 2/3, which matches the left side.\n\nAll steps are valid and the solution is correct. \n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered different methods to solve it, checked my work each time, made sure there were no restrictions on x that would invalidate the solution, and verified by plugging the answer back into the original equation. Everything checks out. \n\nI guess another thing to note is that equations with variables in the denominator require checking that the denominator isn't zero. In this case, x - 5 ≠ 0 => x ≠ 5. Since our solution is x = 11, which is not 5, we're good. If, for some reason, we had gotten x = 5, that would be an extraneous solution and we'd have to reject it, but that's not the case here. \n\nSo yeah, x = 11 is definitely the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{11}.\n</think>"}
