The conductor effectively shields the external region from internal charge configurations.\n   - The induced charge on the outer surface of the conductor behaves as if it were a point charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n3. **Gauss’s Law**:\n   - For a spherical Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total enclosed charge and the radius of the surface.\n   - This is because the symmetry of the sphere ensures that the field is uniform and radial over the surface.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying These Principles**\n\nGiven:\n- The conductor is uncharged initially.\n- A charge $ +q $ is placed inside the cavity.\n- The cavity is off-center by a distance $ s $ from the center of the conductor.\n- The point $ P $ lies outside the conductor at a distance $ L > R $ from the center.\n\nNow consider the induced charges:\n- The inner surface of the cavity will have a charge $ -q $ induced due to the $ +q $ inside.\n- The outer surface of the conductor will have a charge $ +q $ induced.\n- The total charge on the outer surface is $ +q $, and it will distribute uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.\n\nTherefore, for an external point $ P $, the electric field is determined by the total induced charge $ +q $ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\nUsing **Gauss’s Law** for a spherical surface of radius $ L $ centered at the conductor’s center:\n\n$$\nE \\cdot 4\\pi L^2 = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0} \\Rightarrow E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{L^2}\n$$\n\nThis result shows that the electric field at $ P $ is independent of the cavity's position or orientation.

Let me start by recalling some basic principles about conductors and electric fields.\n\nFirst, I remember that in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. Any excess charge on a conductor resides on its outer surface. Also, if there's a cavity inside a conductor, and there's a charge inside the cavity, then the conductor will have induced charges on the inner surface of the cavity. The outer surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside the cavity. Wait, but the conductor is initially uncharged. So if we place a +q charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the cavity will have -q induced, and the outer surface of the conductor will have +q induced. Since the conductor was initially neutral, this makes sense because the total charge would then be zero: -q on the inner cavity surface, +q on the outer surface, and the rest of the conductor is neutral.\n\nNow, the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Since the conductor is a sphere with radius R, and point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor (with L > R), I need to consider how the induced charges on the outer surface contribute to the electric field at P.\n\nBut here's a thought: For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface will distribute themselves uniformly if there's no external electric field. However, in this case, there is a cavity with a charge inside. But since the conductor is isolated (uncharged initially, then a charge is placed inside the cavity), the induced charges on the outer surface should still distribute themselves uniformly, right? Wait, does the position of the cavity affect the distribution of charges on the outer surface?\n\nHmm. Let me think. The presence of a cavity with a charge inside will induce charges on the inner surface of the cavity. But the conductor's outer surface should only depend on the total charge enclosed by the conductor. Since the conductor was initially neutral, and we placed +q inside the cavity, the outer surface will have +q. The distribution of this +q on the outer surface... if the conductor is a perfect sphere, and there are no external fields, then the charges on the outer surface should redistribute uniformly. Because the conductor's outer surface is symmetric, regardless of where the cavity is located inside. Wait, but the cavity is not at the center; it's offset by a distance s from the center. Does this asymmetry affect the charge distribution on the outer surface?\n\nI think not. Because the conductor is a sphere, and the cavity's position is internal. The charges on the outer surface of a conductor only depend on the total charge enclosed, not on the internal distribution. Therefore, even though the cavity is displaced, the outer surface charges will still spread out uniformly. This is because the conductor's outer surface is symmetric, and any internal asymmetries are shielded by the conductor. This is the idea behind electrostatic shielding.\n\nTherefore, for someone outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if all the charge on the conductor's outer surface were concentrated at its center. So the electric field at point P would be the same as that of a point charge +q located at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field E at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². \n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose the cavity was at the center. Then the charge +q inside would induce -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. The outer surface charge would be symmetric, so the field outside would be like a point charge at the center. Now, if the cavity is shifted, but the conductor is still a sphere, the induced charge on the outer surface is still +q. However, is the distribution still uniform?\n\nI think yes. Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere. The charges on the outer surface will repel each other and arrange themselves to minimize potential energy, which in the absence of external fields, leads to a uniform distribution. The internal cavity's position doesn't affect this because the electric field inside the conductor (the material part) is zero. The charges on the outer surface don't \"feel\" the internal charge because the conductor shields them. Therefore, regardless of where the cavity is and where the charge is inside the cavity, the external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. \n\nSo even though the problem mentions the distance l from P to the center of the cavity and the angle θ between l and s, those details are probably there to test if you get confused. The correct answer should depend only on L, the distance from the center of the conductor. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's use Gauss's law. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, say a sphere of radius L centered at the conductor's center. The total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface is +q (since the conductor's outer surface has +q). Therefore, Gauss's law says that the electric flux through this surface is Q_enc / ε₀. Since the Gaussian surface is a sphere, the electric field is uniform over the surface and radial. Therefore, E * 4πL² = q / ε₀ → E = q/(4πε₀ L²). Therefore, this confirms that the electric field outside depends only on L and not on the position of the cavity or the charge inside. Therefore, answer C is correct.\n\nSo options A and B are suggesting that the field depends on l and s, which are distances related to the cavity's position. But since the cavity is inside the conductor, and we are outside, those details don't matter. Option D suggests E depends on l, but since l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, but since the cavity is inside the conductor, and we don't know what's going on inside, but Gauss's law tells us that the field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge. So D is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
