Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since P lies on the line y = -x + 6, its coordinates must satisfy this equation. Let me denote the coordinates of P as (a, b). Then, according to the line equation, b = -a + 6. So, I can express P as (a, -a + 6). That simplifies things because I can work with one variable instead of two.\n\nNow, the problem states that PA = PO. That means the distance from P to A is equal to the distance from P to O. I remember the distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So, I can set up equations using this formula for PA and PO and then set them equal.\n\nLet me write down the expressions for PA and PO.\n\nPA is the distance from P(a, -a + 6) to A(10, -10):\n\nPA^2 = (a - 10)^2 + [(-a + 6) - (-10)]^2\n\nSimilarly, PO is the distance from P(a, -a + 6) to O(0, 0):\n\nPO^2 = (a - 0)^2 + [(-a + 6) - 0]^2\n\nSince PA = PO, their squares should be equal too. So I can set PA^2 = PO^2 and solve for a. That might be easier than dealing with square roots.\n\nLet me compute PA^2 first:\n\nPA^2 = (a - 10)^2 + [(-a + 6) + 10]^2\n\nSimplify the second term: (-a + 6) + 10 = -a + 16\n\nSo PA^2 = (a - 10)^2 + (-a + 16)^2\n\nSimilarly, compute PO^2:\n\nPO^2 = a^2 + (-a + 6)^2\n\nNow set them equal:\n\n(a - 10)^2 + (-a + 16)^2 = a^2 + (-a + 6)^2\n\nNow I need to expand all these terms and solve for a. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (a - 10)^2:\n\n(a - 10)^2 = a^2 - 20a + 100\n\nThen, expand (-a + 16)^2:\n\n(-a + 16)^2 = (-a)^2 + 2*(-a)*(16) + 16^2 = a^2 - 32a + 256\n\nSo PA^2 becomes:\n\na^2 - 20a + 100 + a^2 - 32a + 256 = 2a^2 - 52a + 356\n\nNow compute PO^2:\n\na^2 + (-a + 6)^2\n\nFirst expand (-a + 6)^2:\n\na^2 - 12a + 36\n\nSo PO^2 is:\n\na^2 + a^2 - 12a + 36 = 2a^2 - 12a + 36\n\nSet PA^2 equal to PO^2:\n\n2a^2 - 52a + 356 = 2a^2 - 12a + 36\n\nHmm, let's subtract 2a^2 from both sides:\n\n-52a + 356 = -12a + 36\n\nNow, let's bring all terms to one side. Let me add 52a to both sides and subtract 36:\n\n356 - 36 = 52a - 12a\n\n320 = 40a\n\nSo, 40a = 320 => a = 320 / 40 = 8\n\nSo a = 8. Then, since b = -a + 6, substitute a = 8:\n\nb = -8 + 6 = -2\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of P are (8, -2). Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let me verify the distances PA and PO.\n\nFirst, PA: distance between (8, -2) and (10, -10):\n\nDifference in x: 10 - 8 = 2\n\nDifference in y: -10 - (-2) = -8\n\nPA^2 = 2^2 + (-8)^2 = 4 + 64 = 68\n\nPO: distance between (8, -2) and (0, 0):\n\nDifference in x: 8 - 0 = 8\n\nDifference in y: -2 - 0 = -2\n\nPO^2 = 8^2 + (-2)^2 = 64 + 4 = 68\n\nYes, PA^2 = PO^2 = 68, so PA = PO. So that checks out. Therefore, the coordinates are (8, -2). Wait, but let me think again—is there another possible solution?\n\nWait, when I set up the equation, I squared both sides, which sometimes can introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, we only got one solution. Also, since we have a line and a condition, maybe there is only one such point. Let me visualize.\n\nThe line y = -x + 6. The set of points equidistant from O(0,0) and A(10, -10) is the perpendicular bisector of OA. Maybe I can find the perpendicular bisector and find its intersection with the given line. Let me try that approach to confirm.\n\nFirst, find the midpoint of OA. O(0,0) and A(10, -10). Midpoint M is ((0 + 10)/2, (0 + (-10))/2) = (5, -5). The slope of OA is (-10 - 0)/(10 - 0) = -10/10 = -1. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of -1, which is 1. Therefore, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is y - (-5) = 1*(x - 5), which simplifies to y + 5 = x - 5, so y = x - 10.\n\nTherefore, the set of points equidistant from O and A lie on the line y = x - 10. Therefore, the point P must lie on both y = -x + 6 and y = x - 10. Let me solve these two equations:\n\nSet -x + 6 = x - 10\n\n6 + 10 = x + x\n\n16 = 2x => x = 8. Then y = 8 - 10 = -2. So same result: (8, -2). Therefore, this confirms that (8, -2) is indeed the correct answer. Therefore, the coordinates are (8, -2). So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again if there's another intersection point. The line y = -x + 6 and the perpendicular bisector y = x - 10. Since they are two straight lines with slopes -1 and 1, they intersect at one point only. Therefore, there is only one such point P. Therefore, my answer is correct.\n\nBut let me also check if there is a possibility that the point P is such that PA = PO in some other way. For example, maybe there is another point on the line y = -x + 6 that satisfies PA = PO? But according to the perpendicular bisector method, there is only one such point. So, I think that's the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if I made any mistake in my algebra when expanding the terms. Let me go back through my steps again.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nPA^2 = (a - 10)^2 + (-a + 16)^2\n\nExpanding (a - 10)^2 = a² - 20a + 100\n\n(-a + 16)^2 = a² - 32a + 256. Sum is 2a² -52a + 356.\n\nPO^2 = a² + (-a + 6)^2 = a² + a² -12a + 36 = 2a² -12a + 36.\n\nSet equal: 2a² -52a + 356 = 2a² -12a + 36.\n\nSubtract 2a²: -52a + 356 = -12a + 36.\n\nThen moving terms: 356 - 36 = 52a -12a => 320 = 40a => a = 8. Correct. So algebra is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (8, -2). So I think that's correct.\n\nBut let me also check if the point (8, -2) lies on the line y = -x + 6. Let me compute -8 + 6 = -2. Yes, y = -2. Correct. So all conditions are satisfied. Therefore, I think the answer is (8, -2). Therefore, I can write that as the ordered pair.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coordinates of point $ P $ are \\boxed{(8, -2)}.\n</think>"}
