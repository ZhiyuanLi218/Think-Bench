The problem is about particles being collided in a spherical detector, producing new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of them reach the detector walls. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed to have about two thirds of the particles reach the walls. The radius is 30 meters, and the options are 68, 28, 54, or 40.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Lorentz factor has to do with the particles reaching the detector walls. Since the particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime in the lab frame must be related to their proper lifetime and their velocity. The key here is probably the time dilation effect. The particles have a certain proper lifetime (tau), and in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma * tau. So, if they travel farther before decaying, more of them would reach the detector walls.\n\nBut how does this translate to the fraction of particles reaching the walls? The problem states that currently, with gamma ~20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma that would result in two thirds reaching the walls. \n\nLet me think about the decay process. The number of particles that survive a distance x is given by the exponential decay formula: N = N0 * e^(-x/(gamma * beta * c * tau)). Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the mean lifetime. The mean free path before decay would be gamma * beta * c * tau. But if the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, beta is close to 1. However, since they are ultra-relativistic, maybe beta is approximately 1. So the distance they can travel before decaying is proportional to gamma. \n\nBut the problem is about the fraction that reach the detector. If the radius is 30 meters, then the distance they need to travel is 30 meters. The survival probability is e^(-t / (gamma * tau)), where t is the time it takes to reach the wall. But t is distance divided by speed. Since the particles are moving at v ≈ c, t ≈ 30 meters / c. \n\nSo the survival probability is e^(- (30 m / c) / (gamma * tau)). Let me denote this as e^(- (30 / (gamma * c * tau)) ). Let me define the proper lifetime as tau. \n\nBut how does the fraction of particles reaching the wall relate to gamma? If the survival probability is proportional to e^(-L/(gamma * beta * c * tau)), where L is the distance to the wall. Assuming beta ≈ 1, since gamma is large (around 20 or higher), then beta ≈ 1. So the survival probability is e^(-L/(gamma * c * tau)). \n\nBut the problem states that for gamma ~20, the fraction is 1/3. Let's denote that fraction as f = e^(-L/(gamma * c * tau)) = 1/3. We need to find the gamma' such that f' = e^(-L/(gamma' * c * tau)) = 2/3. \n\nSo we can set up the equations:\n\nFor gamma = 20: e^(-L/(gamma * c * tau)) = 1/3.\n\nFor gamma' (which we need to find): e^(-L/(gamma' * c * tau)) = 2/3.\n\nTaking natural logs of both equations:\n\n- L/(gamma * c * tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n\nand \n\n- L/(gamma' * c * tau) = ln(1/ (2/3)) = -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2).\n\nSo we have:\n\nL/(gamma * c * tau) = ln(3)\n\nand \n\nL/(gamma' * c * tau) = ln(3/2)\n\nDividing the first equation by the second equation:\n\n(L/(gamma * c * tau)) / (L/(gamma' * c * tau)) ) = ln(3)/ln(3/2)\n\nSimplify:\n\ngamma' / gamma = ln(3)/ln(3/2)\n\nTherefore:\n\ngamma' = gamma * [ln(3)/ln(3/2)]\n\nGiven that the original gamma is 20, then:\n\ngamma' = 20 * [ln(3)/ln(3/2)]\n\nLet me calculate that. Let me compute ln(3) and ln(3/2):\n\nln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.7095\n\nTherefore, gamma' ≈ 20 * 2.7095 ≈ 54.19\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 54. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because the problem says \"about two thirds\" and the options are given. Also, maybe my assumption that beta is 1 is correct? For ultra-relativistic particles, gamma is large, so beta is approximately 1 - 1/(2 gamma^2), but for the purposes of this problem, since the exact value of beta isn't given, and the initial gamma is 20, which is already quite large, so beta is very close to 1. Therefore, the approximation beta ≈ 1 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if they had considered beta as exactly 1, then the calculation is as above. But if beta isn't exactly 1, then the formula would be different. However, since the problem states that the particles are ultra-relativistic and centered around gamma ~20, so beta is very close to 1, so the difference is negligible here.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. The gamma needed is approximately 54.19, which is closest to option C (54). Therefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
