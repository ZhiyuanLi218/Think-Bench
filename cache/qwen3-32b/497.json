So, we have a synchrocyclotron where a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy and it undergoes two accelerations to reach 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], with Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are A:3536, B:5300, C:1864, D:2500.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a cyclotron does. A cyclotron accelerates charged particles using a high-frequency alternating voltage and a perpendicular magnetic field. The particles spiral outward as they gain energy, making multiple revolutions while being accelerated each time they cross the gap between the \"dees\" (the two D-shaped electrodes). In a standard cyclotron, the frequency of the alternating voltage is constant, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is adjusted to account for relativistic effects as the particles gain speed. However, the problem mentions a synchrocyclotron, but the voltage given is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The notation ν(α) suggests that the frequency depends on some parameter α, which might be related to relativistic effects. However, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Wait, two accelerations? That might mean that the proton is accelerated twice per revolution? Or maybe it's accelerated once per revolution? Wait, in a cyclotron, particles are accelerated twice per revolution—once when moving from one dee to the other and once when moving back. But actually, in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they cross the gap. Since they go back and forth between the dees, each full revolution (which would be two crossings of the gap) would result in two accelerations. But depending on the design, maybe each half revolution? Wait, actually, let me think. In a cyclotron, the particle is accelerated once per half-circle. So each full revolution would have two accelerations? Wait, no. Let me check. The particle starts in one dee, and when it exits the dee to cross the gap, it's accelerated by the electric field. Then it goes into the other dee, and when it comes back to the gap, it's accelerated again. So each full revolution (two half-circles) would result in two accelerations. But if the frequency is adjusted properly, the timing is such that each time the particle crosses the gap, it's accelerated. So if the particle makes N revolutions, it would cross the gap 2N times, hence being accelerated 2N times. But the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Wait, that seems contradictory. If it undergoes two accelerations, then maybe it's accelerated twice, meaning that it makes one revolution? But that would not make sense because the kinetic energy would be too low. Wait, perhaps the wording is different. Maybe \"undergoes two accelerations\" means that it's accelerated twice, i.e., crosses the gap twice, hence making one full revolution? But the problem says \"to reach the kinetic energy T1 = 950 MeV\". So maybe the number of accelerations is equal to the number of times it crosses the gap, each time gaining some kinetic energy. Therefore, if it undergoes two accelerations, that would mean two crossings, hence one revolution? But then how does it reach 950 MeV with just two accelerations? That seems extremely high. Maybe the question is mistyped? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"undergoes two accelerations\". Maybe \"two accelerations\" refers to two voltage cycles? Or maybe it's a translation issue. Alternatively, perhaps \"two accelerations\" is a mistranslation or misnomer, and actually refers to the number of times the proton is accelerated per revolution. Wait, maybe the problem is that in a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated once per revolution? But in a standard cyclotron, it's twice. However, if the synchrocyclotron is designed such that the proton is accelerated once per revolution, then the number of revolutions would be equal to the number of times it's accelerated. But the problem states \"undergoes two accelerations\", so maybe two times, so one revolution? But again, getting to 950 MeV with just two accelerations seems impossible with 190 kV. Let me check the numbers.\n\nLet me recall the kinetic energy gained per acceleration. Each time the proton crosses the gap, it gains kinetic energy equal to q * U, where q is the charge of the proton (1.6e-19 C), and U is the voltage. However, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...). The timing has to be such that the proton is accelerated when the voltage is at its maximum? Or when the electric field is in the right direction. Since the proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, and the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So maybe we need to calculate how much energy is gained each time the proton crosses the gap.\n\nBut the problem says \"undergoes two accelerations\". Maybe \"two accelerations\" means that it is accelerated twice, i.e., crosses the gap twice, and each time it's accelerated by the full voltage U0? If that's the case, then total kinetic energy would be 2 * q * U0. Let me calculate that. U0 is 190 kV, so 190,000 V. 2 * 1.6e-19 C * 190,000 V = 2 * 1.6e-19 * 1.9e5 = 2 * 3.04e-14 = 6.08e-14 J. Let's convert that to MeV. 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1 MeV is 1.6e-13 J. So 6.08e-14 J / 1.6e-13 J/MeV = 0.38 MeV. But the problem says the kinetic energy is 950 MeV. So that's way too low. Therefore, my assumption that the proton is accelerated twice with the full voltage is wrong. Therefore, the term \"undergoes two accelerations\" must mean something else.\n\nWait, perhaps in a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated once per revolution? So if it makes N revolutions, it is accelerated N times? Then total kinetic energy would be N * q * U0. But again, same problem. Let me check. If N * q * U0 = 950 MeV. Let's compute N. Let me convert 950 MeV to Joules. 950 MeV = 950 * 1e6 eV = 950e6 * 1.6e-19 J = 1.52e-10 J. Then N * q * U0 = N * 1.6e-19 C * 1.9e5 V = N * 3.04e-14 J. So N = (1.52e-10 J) / (3.04e-14 J) ≈ 5000. So N ≈ 5000. Looking at the options, B is 5300 and D is 2500. Hmm. So if the number of accelerations is equal to the number of revolutions, then N ≈ 5000, which is close to option B. But the problem says \"undergoes two accelerations\". Wait, maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"A proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, i.e., T≈0 undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV.\" The wording is a bit confusing. Maybe \"undergoes two accelerations\" means that it is accelerated twice per revolution? So if it makes N revolutions, it is accelerated 2N times. Then total energy would be 2N * q * U0. Let's compute 2N * q * U0 = 950 MeV. Then N would be 950 MeV / (2 * q * U0). Let's calculate 2 * q * U0 in MeV. q * U0 is 1.6e-19 C * 1.9e5 V = 3.04e-14 J. As before, that is 3.04e-14 / 1.6e-13 = 0.19 MeV. Then 2 * q * U0 is 0.38 MeV. Therefore, N would be 950 / 0.38 ≈ 2500. Which is option D. So if the number of accelerations is 2N, then N ≈ 2500. So the number of revolutions would be 2500. But why does the problem say \"undergoes two accelerations\"? Maybe there's a mistranslation or misstatement. Perhaps it should say \"undergoes two accelerations per revolution\", which would make sense. If so, then the number of revolutions would be 2500, which is option D. Alternatively, maybe \"undergoes two accelerations\" is a typo and should be \"undergoes multiple accelerations\", and the question is to find how many. Given that with two accelerations per revolution, you get 2500 revolutions, which is option D. However, in standard cyclotron theory, particles are accelerated twice per revolution. Therefore, if we assume that, then total number of accelerations is 2N, where N is number of revolutions. Therefore, total kinetic energy is 2N * q * U0. Wait, but relativistic effects might complicate things. However, since the kinetic energy is 950 MeV, which is a significant fraction of the rest mass energy of the proton (which is about 938 MeV). So relativistic effects are definitely important here. Therefore, the assumption that each acceleration gives q * U0 might not hold because as the proton gains speed, its velocity approaches the speed of light, so the time between accelerations changes, and the frequency of the voltage must be adjusted accordingly. However, the problem gives a voltage function U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The ν(α) suggests that the frequency is a function of some parameter α, which might be related to the relativistic gamma factor. However, the problem does not provide specific information about how ν(α) behaves or what α is. Therefore, maybe we are supposed to ignore relativistic effects? But with kinetic energy of 950 MeV, which is comparable to the rest mass energy of the proton (which is about 938 MeV), so relativistic effects can't be ignored. Hmm. This complicates things. However, the problem might be simplified, assuming that even with relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is approximately the number of accelerations multiplied by q * U0. Maybe for the sake of the problem, we are supposed to ignore relativistic effects? Let me check the numbers. If we proceed with the non-relativistic approach, even though it's not strictly valid, maybe that's what is expected here. Let me try that.\n\nSo, assuming that each time the proton crosses the gap, it gains kinetic energy q * U0. In a standard cyclotron, particles are accelerated twice per revolution. So if the proton makes N revolutions, it is accelerated 2N times. Therefore, total kinetic energy T = 2N * q * U0. Solving for N:\n\nN = T / (2 q U0)\n\nBut T is given as 950 MeV. Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, convert T to joules:\n\nT = 950 MeV = 950 * 10^6 eV * 1.6 * 10^-19 J/eV = 950 * 1.6 * 10^-13 J = 1.52 * 10^-10 J.\n\nq * U0 = 1.6 * 10^-19 C * 190 * 10^3 V = 1.6 * 190 * 10^-16 J = 304 * 10^-16 J = 3.04 * 10^-14 J.\n\nThen 2 * q * U0 = 6.08 * 10^-14 J.\n\nTherefore, N = T / (2 q U0) = (1.52 * 10^-10 J) / (6.08 * 10^-14 J) ≈ 2500. Exactly option D. Therefore, the answer is D:2500. However, this assumes that each acceleration gives q * U0, and that there are 2N accelerations for N revolutions. However, in reality, with relativistic effects, the energy gain per acceleration would be less because the time between accelerations increases as the protons get heavier (due to relativistic mass increase), so the frequency has to be adjusted. But since the problem gives a specific voltage function with ν(α), which presumably accounts for that, but without more information on ν(α), we can't do a proper relativistic calculation. Therefore, maybe the problem expects us to ignore relativistic effects and just do the classical calculation, which gives 2500, option D. Additionally, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so maybe the problem is designed to use the simple non-relativistic approach. Also, given that the answer comes out neatly to 2500, which is one of the options, this seems plausible.\n\nBut let me think again why the problem mentions \"undergoes two accelerations\". Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If the proton is injected and undergoes two accelerations, meaning that it is accelerated twice, then N would be 1 revolution? But that gives only 0.38 MeV as I calculated before, which is way too low. Therefore, the wording must mean something else. Perhaps the problem is in Chinese or another language, and \"undergoes two accelerations\" is a translation of something like \"is accelerated twice per revolution\", which would make sense. In that case, the number of revolutions would be 2500, option D. Given that the calculation gives exactly 2500, which is one of the options, I think this is the intended approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D:2500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
