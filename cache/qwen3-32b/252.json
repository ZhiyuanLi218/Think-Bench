Let me start by writing down the equation again to make sure I have it right: 2³ * 3^x = 72. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should simplify the left side as much as possible. 2³ is 8, right? So substituting that in, the equation becomes 8 * 3^x = 72. Hmm, okay. Now, I need to solve for x. Since 3^x is being multiplied by 8, maybe I can divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate the term with x. Let me try that.\n\nDividing both sides by 8 gives me 3^x = 72 / 8. Calculating 72 divided by 8... that's 9. So now the equation is 3^x = 9. Alright, now I need to solve for x in this exponential equation. I remember that if I can express 9 as a power of 3, then I can set the exponents equal to each other. Since 3 squared is 9, right? 3² = 9. Therefore, 3^x = 3² implies that x must be 2. So, x equals 2?\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation: 2³ * 3^x = 72. Calculating 2³ is 8, so 8 * 3^x = 72. Dividing both sides by 8 gives 3^x = 9. Then since 3 squared is 9, x must be 2. Let me verify by plugging x = 2 back into the original equation. 2³ is 8, and 3² is 9, so 8 * 9 is indeed 72. Yep, that checks out.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this problem? Let me think. Perhaps using logarithms? Although since 9 is a power of 3, it's straightforward, but just to practice, let me try taking the logarithm of both sides. So starting from 3^x = 9. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(3^x) = ln(9). Using the logarithm power rule, that becomes x * ln(3) = ln(9). Then x = ln(9)/ln(3). Now, ln(9) is the same as ln(3²), which is 2*ln(3). Therefore, x = 2*ln(3)/ln(3) = 2. So same answer. Okay, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor 72 into its prime factors and see how that relates to 2³ * 3^x. Let me try that. Prime factorization of 72: 72 divided by 2 is 36, divided by 2 again is 18, divided by 2 again is 9, then divided by 3 is 3, and divided by 3 again is 1. So that's 2³ * 3². Therefore, 72 is 2³ * 3². Comparing that to the original equation, which is 2³ * 3^x, so if 2³ * 3^x equals 2³ * 3², then x must be 2. Yep, that's another way to see it. So regardless of the method, I end up with x = 2. \n\nIs there any chance I could have messed up the prime factorization? Let me check again. 2*2*2*3*3 is 8*9, which is 72. Yep, that's correct. So the exponent on 3 is indeed 2. Therefore, x is 2.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the prime factors, maybe I could list out multiples of 3 until I get to 9? But that seems unnecessary here. Since 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, so again, x is 2. \n\nI think all methods point to x being 2. Let me just recap all steps once more to ensure no step was overlooked. Original equation: 2³ * 3^x = 72. 2³ is 8. 72 divided by 8 is 9. 3^x = 9. Since 3 squared is 9, x is 2. Verified through multiple methods: direct computation, logarithms, prime factorization. All confirm x = 2. \n\nI guess another way someone might approach it is by trial and error. Let's say x is 1: 3^1 is 3, 8*3 is 24, which is less than 72. x is 2: 8*9=72. There we go. If x was 3: 8*27=216, way too big. So x=2 is the only reasonable answer here. \n\nNo other integer exponents would make sense here. If someone tried fractions or decimals, but since 9 is a power of 3, it's straightforward. If it wasn't, we would need logarithms. For example, if it was 3^x = 10, we would need to use logs, but here it's simple. \n\nTherefore, after all these checks and different methods, I'm confident that x equals 2 is the correct solution. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ x $ is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>"}
