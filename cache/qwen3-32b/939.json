The problem is about radioactive decay of iodine-125. The half-life is given as 60 days, and we need to find the fraction remaining after 180 days. Hmm. Alright, so half-life means the time it takes for half of the substance to decay, right? So each half-life, the amount is reduced by half.\n\nSo first, I need to figure out how many half-lives have passed in 180 days. Since each half-life is 60 days, I can divide 180 by 60. Let me do that: 180 divided by 60 is 3. So there are 3 half-lives in 180 days.\n\nNow, starting with the original mass, after each half-life, the remaining mass is multiplied by 1/2. So after the first half-life (60 days), it's 1/2 of original. After the second (120 days total), it's 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. Then after the third half-life (180 days total), it's 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8. Wait, so that would be 1/8 of the original mass left?\n\nBut let me check again. Let me write it step by step. The formula for remaining quantity is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where T is the half-life. So here, t is 180 days, T is 60 days. So exponent is 180 / 60 = 3. So (1/2)^3 = 1/8. Yes, so the fraction remaining is 1/8. So the answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think of another way. If I start with, say, 100 grams. After 60 days: 50 grams. After 120 days: 25 grams. After 180 days: 12.5 grams. So 12.5 is 1/8 of 100. Yes, because 100 / 8 is 12.5. So that's correct. So the fraction is 1/8. So option B is the answer. The options given are (A) 1/16, (B) 1/8, (C) 1/4, (D) 1/2. So B is correct. I think that's right. No, I don't see any errors in this reasoning. The key was calculating the number of half-lives correctly and applying the exponent. Yep, 3 half-lives, so 1/2^3 = 1/8.\n</think>"}
