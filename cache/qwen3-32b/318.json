Let me start by recalling what a bound state is. A bound state is a quantum state where the particle is localized, meaning its wavefunction tends to zero as x approaches infinity (or in this case, as x approaches the boundaries of the system). Since the potential here is a delta function at x=0 for x > -d and infinite for x < -d, the particle is confined to the region x ≥ -d. \n\nFirst, let me sketch the potential. For x > -d, it's a delta function well at x=0 with strength -V₀ (since it's -V₀ δ(x)), and for x < -d, it's an infinite potential, so the wavefunction must be zero there. So the particle is in a semi-infinite region from x = -d to infinity, with a delta function well at x=0. \n\nI remember that for a single delta function potential in free space (i.e., without the infinite wall at x = -d), there is always one bound state regardless of the strength V₀. But here, the presence of the infinite potential wall at x = -d complicates things. So the question is, how does this infinite wall affect the existence of bound states?\n\nLet me think about the general approach. For bound states, the energy E is negative. The wavefunction must satisfy the Schrödinger equation in the regions where the potential is defined. Since the potential is piecewise defined, I need to solve the Schrödinger equation in different regions and match the boundary conditions.\n\nLet me write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE):\n\n- (ħ²/2m) ψ''(x) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nGiven that E is negative for bound states, let me define κ = sqrt(-2mE)/ħ, so that κ is real and positive. Then, the solutions to the Schrödinger equation in regions without the delta function will be exponential functions.\n\nBut first, let me consider the regions. The potential is infinite for x < -d, so ψ(x) = 0 for x < -d. For x > -d, the potential is -V₀ δ(x). However, the delta function is only at x=0. So the region from -d to 0 and from 0 to infinity. Wait, but the delta function is at x=0, so we need to split the region x > -d into two parts: -d < x < 0 and x > 0. But since the delta function is only at x=0, the Schrödinger equation in those regions (excluding x=0) will have V(x)=0 except at the point x=0.\n\nBut let me think again. The potential is -V₀ δ(x) for x > -d. So for x > -d, except at x=0, the potential is zero, and there's a delta function at x=0. Therefore, the regions are:\n\n1. -d < x < 0: V(x) = 0\n2. x = 0: V(x) = -V₀ δ(x)\n3. x > 0: V(x) = 0\n\nBut also, for x approaching -d from the right, the wavefunction must go to zero because of the infinite potential there. So ψ(-d) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to solving the Schrödinger equation in these regions with appropriate boundary conditions.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for x > 0, since V(x) = 0, the general solution is:\n\nψ(x) = A e^{-κ x} + B e^{κ x}\n\nBut since we are looking for bound states, the wavefunction must be square-integrable. For x approaching infinity, the wavefunction must go to zero. Therefore, B must be zero. Hence, ψ(x) = A e^{-κ x} for x > 0.\n\nFor -d < x < 0, V(x) = 0, so the general solution is similar:\n\nψ(x) = C e^{κ x} + D e^{-κ x}\n\nBut here, we need to consider the boundary condition at x = -d. At x = -d, ψ(-d) = 0. Let me apply that.\n\nSo, for x approaching -d from the right (which is in the region -d < x < 0):\n\nψ(-d) = C e^{-κ d} + D e^{κ d} = 0\n\nTherefore,\n\nC e^{-κ d} + D e^{κ d} = 0 --> Equation (1)\n\nNow, we also need to consider the continuity of the wavefunction at x=0 and the discontinuity in the derivative due to the delta function.\n\nAt x=0, the wavefunction must be continuous. So:\n\nψ(0^+) = ψ(0^-)\n\nFrom x > 0: ψ(0^+) = A e^{0} = A\n\nFrom -d < x < 0: ψ(0^-) = C e^{0} + D e^{0} = C + D\n\nTherefore, A = C + D --> Equation (2)\n\nNext, the derivative discontinuity. The delta function potential introduces a discontinuity in the derivative of the wavefunction. The standard treatment for delta function potentials is that the derivative has a jump proportional to the strength of the delta function.\n\nIntegrate the Schrödinger equation from x=0^- to x=0^+:\n\n∫_{-ε}^{ε} [ - (ħ²/2m) ψ''(x) + V(x)ψ(x) ] dx = ∫_{-ε}^{ε} E ψ(x) dx\n\nAs ε approaches 0, the integral of the potential term becomes:\n\n∫_{-ε}^{ε} -V₀ δ(x) ψ(x) dx = -V₀ ψ(0)\n\nThe other terms:\n\nThe integral of Eψ(x) dx goes to zero as ε→0 because E is finite and ψ is continuous.\n\nThe integral of - (ħ²/2m) ψ''(x) dx becomes - (ħ²/2m)[ψ'(ε) - ψ'(-ε)] as ε→0.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- (ħ²/2m)[ψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-)] - V₀ ψ(0) = 0\n\nTherefore:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = - (2m / ħ²)(-V₀) ψ(0) = (2m V₀ / ħ²) ψ(0)\n\nBut let's compute the derivatives.\n\nFor x > 0, ψ(x) = A e^{-κ x}, so ψ'(x) = -κ A e^{-κ x}, so ψ'(0^+) = -κ A\n\nFor -d < x < 0, ψ(x) = C e^{κ x} + D e^{-κ x}, so ψ'(x) = κ C e^{κ x} - κ D e^{-κ x}, so ψ'(0^-) = κ C - κ D\n\nTherefore, the jump condition is:\n\n[ -κ A ] - [ κ C - κ D ] = (2m V₀ / ħ²) A\n\nWait, let me check again. The left-hand side is ψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-):\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = (-κ A) - [κ C - κ D] = -κ A - κ C + κ D\n\nWhich equals κ ( -A - C + D )\n\nBut from equation (2), A = C + D, so -A - C + D = - (C + D) - C + D = -C - D - C + D = -2C\n\nTherefore, ψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = κ (-2 C )\n\nTherefore, according to the jump condition:\n\nκ (-2 C ) = (2m V₀ / ħ²) A\n\nBut since A = C + D, we can write:\n\n-2 κ C = (2m V₀ / ħ²) (C + D) --> Equation (3)\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\nEquation (1): C e^{-κ d} + D e^{κ d} = 0\n\nEquation (2): A = C + D\n\nEquation (3): -2 κ C = (2m V₀ / ħ²) A\n\nOur unknowns are A, C, D, and κ. But since we are looking for non-trivial solutions, we can set up a system of equations to find the condition on κ (and hence on E) such that non-zero solutions exist.\n\nLet me express D from Equation (1):\n\nFrom Equation (1):\n\nC e^{-κ d} + D e^{κ d} = 0 => D = - C e^{-κ d} / e^{κ d} = - C e^{-2 κ d}\n\nTherefore, D = - C e^{-2 κ d}\n\nThen from Equation (2):\n\nA = C + D = C - C e^{-2 κ d} = C [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nFrom Equation (3):\n\n-2 κ C = (2m V₀ / ħ²) A = (2m V₀ / ħ²) C [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nAssuming C ≠ 0 (otherwise trivial solution), we can divide both sides by C:\n\n-2 κ = (2m V₀ / ħ²) [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n-2 κ = (2m V₀ / ħ²) [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n2 κ = - (2m V₀ / ħ²) [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nκ = - (m V₀ / ħ²) [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nBut V₀ is a positive constant? Wait, in the potential, it's -V₀ δ(x). So the delta function potential is attractive if V₀ is positive. So in the standard delta function well, we have -α δ(x) with α > 0. In our case, the potential is -V₀ δ(x), so V₀ is positive for an attractive potential. Therefore, the strength of the delta function is -V₀, so if V₀ is positive, it's an attractive potential.\n\nBut in the jump condition, we had:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = (2m / ħ²)(V₀) ψ(0)\n\nWait, earlier I had written:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = (2m V₀ / ħ²) A\n\nBut let me check the sign again. The integral of the potential term was -V₀ δ(x) ψ(x), so integrating gives -V₀ ψ(0). Then the equation was:\n\n- (ħ²/2m)[ψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-)] - V₀ ψ(0) = 0 => rearranged:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = - (2m / ħ²)( -V₀ ψ(0) ) = (2m V₀ / ħ²) ψ(0)\n\nYes, so the right-hand side is positive if V₀ is positive. Therefore, the equation:\n\nκ (-2 C ) = (2m V₀ / ħ²) A\n\nBut then proceeding, we had:\n\n-2 κ C = (2m V₀ / ħ²) A\n\nThen substituting A = C [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]:\n\n-2 κ C = (2m V₀ / ħ²) C [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nCanceling C:\n\n-2 κ = (2m V₀ / ħ²) [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nWhich gives:\n\nκ = - (m V₀ / ħ²) [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nBut since κ is positive (as defined earlier, κ = sqrt(-2mE)/ħ, and E is negative), the right-hand side must also be positive. Therefore, the RHS is negative times [1 - e^{-2 κ d}]. Let me check the sign:\n\nGiven that V₀ is positive (attractive potential), then the RHS is - (positive) * [1 - e^{-2 κ d}]. Therefore, for the RHS to be positive, we need:\n\n- [1 - e^{-2 κ d}] > 0 => 1 - e^{-2 κ d} < 0 => e^{-2 κ d} > 1 => -2 κ d > 0 => κ < 0. But κ is positive, so this is impossible. Wait, this suggests a contradiction. That can't be right. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me check again. The equation was:\n\n-2 κ = (2m V₀ / ħ²) [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\n-2 κ / (2m V₀ / ħ²) = [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nWhich is:\n\n- (ħ² / m V₀) κ = [ 1 - e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nBut since κ > 0 and V₀ > 0, the left-hand side is negative, and the right-hand side is [1 - e^{-something}]. Since e^{-something} is always positive and less than or equal to 1 (since the exponent is negative, so e^{-2 κ d} is between 0 and 1). Therefore, 1 - e^{-2 κ d} is positive. Therefore, we have a negative equals a positive? That can't be. Therefore, there's a mistake in my derivation.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nStarting from the jump condition:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = (2m / ħ²) * (-V₀) * ψ(0)? Wait, no. Let me rederive the jump condition carefully.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is:\n\n- (ħ²/2m) ψ''(x) + V(x)ψ(x) = E ψ(x)\n\nIntegrate from -ε to +ε:\n\n∫_{-ε}^{ε} [ - (ħ²/2m) ψ''(x) + V(x)ψ(x) ] dx = ∫_{-ε}^{ε} E ψ(x) dx\n\nAs ε → 0, the right-hand side goes to zero. The integral of the potential term becomes ∫_{-ε}^{ε} (-V₀ δ(x)) ψ(x) dx = -V₀ ψ(0). The integral of - (ħ²/2m) ψ''(x) dx is - (ħ²/2m) [ψ'(ε) - ψ'(-ε)].\n\nTherefore:\n\n- (ħ²/2m)[ψ'(ε) - ψ'(-ε)] - V₀ ψ(0) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -2m/ħ²:\n\n[ψ'(ε) - ψ'(-ε)] + (2m / ħ²) V₀ ψ(0) = 0\n\nTherefore:\n\nψ'(ε) - ψ'(-ε) = - (2m / ħ²) V₀ ψ(0)\n\nTaking the limit ε → 0:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = - (2m / ħ²) V₀ ψ(0)\n\nAh! Previously, I had a sign error here. Earlier, I thought the RHS was positive, but actually, it's negative. Let me correct that.\n\nSo the correct equation is:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = - (2m / ħ²) V₀ ψ(0)\n\nPreviously, I had a positive sign, but it's actually negative. Therefore, going back:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = - (2m / ħ²) V₀ ψ(0)\n\nSo let's recompute the left-hand side.\n\nFrom before:\n\nψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = -κ A - [κ C - κ D] = -κ A - κ C + κ D = -κ (A + C) + κ D\n\nBut since A = C + D, then A + C = C + D + C = 2C + D. Hmm, maybe better to substitute A = C + D.\n\nAlternatively, let's redo the left-hand side:\n\nψ'(0^+) = -κ A\n\nψ'(0^-) = κ C - κ D\n\nTherefore, ψ'(0^+) - ψ'(0^-) = -κ A - κ C + κ D = -κ (A + C) + κ D\n\nBut A = C + D, so substituting:\n\n-κ (C + D + C) + κ D = -κ (2C + D) + κ D = -2 κ C - κ D + κ D = -2 κ C\n\nTherefore, left-hand side is -2 κ C, and right-hand side is - (2m / ħ²) V₀ ψ(0) = - (2m / ħ²) V₀ A\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n-2 κ C = - (2m / ħ²) V₀ A\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 κ C = (2m / ħ²) V₀ A\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nκ C = (m / ħ²) V₀ A\n\nNow, from Equation (2): A = C + D, and from Equation (1): D = - C e^{-2 κ d}\n\nTherefore, A = C - C e^{-2 κ d} = C (1 - e^{-2 κ d})\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nκ C = (m / ħ²) V₀ * C (1 - e^{-2 κ d})\n\nAssuming C ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by C:\n\nκ = (m V₀ / ħ²) (1 - e^{-2 κ d})\n\nSo this is the corrected equation. Now, since κ is positive, and V₀ is positive (attractive potential), the RHS is positive, as (1 - e^{-2 κ d}) is positive because e^{-2 κ d} < 1. Therefore, this equation makes sense.\n\nSo now, the transcendental equation is:\n\nκ = (m V₀ / ħ²) (1 - e^{-2 κ d})\n\nOur goal is to find conditions on V₀ and d such that there exists at least one solution κ > 0 to this equation.\n\nLet me define some constants to simplify notation. Let me set:\n\nLet’s define α = m V₀ / ħ², so the equation becomes:\n\nκ = α (1 - e^{-2 κ d})\n\nWe need to find if there exists κ > 0 satisfying this equation.\n\nAlternatively, rearranged:\n\ne^{-2 κ d} = 1 - κ / α\n\nBut since the exponential is always positive, the RHS must also be positive. Therefore:\n\n1 - κ / α > 0 => κ < α\n\nSo κ must be less than α. Also, since e^{-2 κ d} is between 0 and 1, the RHS 1 - κ / α must be between 0 and 1, which requires 0 < κ < α.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nLet me consider the function f(κ) = α (1 - e^{-2 κ d}) - κ. We need to find if f(κ) = 0 has a solution for κ > 0.\n\nAlternatively, define f(κ) = κ - α (1 - e^{-2 κ d}) = 0.\n\nLet me analyze the behavior of f(κ):\n\nAt κ = 0:\n\nf(0) = 0 - α (1 - 1) = 0 - 0 = 0. Wait, but that suggests κ=0 is a solution? But κ is defined as sqrt(-2mE)/ħ, so E is negative, so κ must be positive. However, κ approaching zero would correspond to E approaching zero from below. But if we plug κ=0 into the equation, we get 0 = α (1 - 1) => 0 = 0. However, this is trivial. But we need non-trivial solutions where κ > 0. Let me check the derivative of f(κ) near zero.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of f(κ):\n\ndf/dκ = 1 - α [ 0 - (-2 d) e^{-2 κ d} ] = 1 - α [ 2 d e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nAt κ = 0:\n\ndf/dκ |_{κ=0} = 1 - 2 α d\n\nTherefore, if df/dκ at κ=0 is positive, then f(κ) increases from zero, so there might be no solution. If it's negative, then f(κ) decreases from zero, implying there is a solution.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's analyze the function f(κ) = κ - α (1 - e^{-2 κ d}).\n\nAt κ=0, f(0)=0.\n\nAs κ increases from 0, what happens to f(κ)? Let's compute the derivative:\n\ndf/dκ = 1 - α * derivative of [1 - e^{-2 κ d} ] = 1 - α * [ 2 d e^{-2 κ d} ]\n\nSo at κ=0:\n\ndf/dκ = 1 - 2 α d.\n\nIf df/dκ at κ=0 is positive, that means the function is increasing at κ=0. If it's negative, the function is decreasing at κ=0.\n\nIf the derivative is positive at κ=0, then since f(0)=0 and increasing, f(κ) becomes positive for κ > 0. However, we need to check the behavior as κ approaches α (since κ < α as per earlier). What happens as κ approaches α from below?\n\nAs κ approaches α, the RHS of the original equation is α (1 - e^{-2 κ d}), but since κ approaches α, let's see:\n\nIf κ approaches α, then e^{-2 κ d} approaches e^{-2 α d}. Therefore, the RHS approaches α (1 - e^{-2 α d}).\n\nBut we need to check if f(κ) tends to something negative or positive. Wait, f(κ) = κ - α (1 - e^{-2 κ d}).\n\nAs κ approaches α, f(κ) approaches α - α (1 - e^{-2 α d}) = α e^{-2 α d} > 0.\n\nTherefore, if at κ=0, df/dκ is positive (i.e., 1 - 2 α d > 0 => α d < 1/2), then f(κ) increases from 0 and remains positive, so there is no solution for κ > 0. However, if at κ=0, the derivative is negative (i.e., 1 - 2 α d < 0 => α d > 1/2), then f(κ) decreases from 0, and since as κ approaches α, f(κ) approaches α e^{-2 α d} > 0, there must be some point where f(κ) crosses zero. Therefore, there is a solution.\n\nTherefore, the condition for existence of at least one bound state is α d > 1/2, i.e.,\n\n(m V₀ / ħ²) d > 1/2 => V₀ > (ħ² / 2 m d)\n\nTherefore, the condition is that V₀ must be greater than ħ²/(2 m d). \n\nBut let me verify this conclusion with another approach. Let me consider the case when there is no infinite wall, i.e., d approaches infinity. In that case, our problem reduces to the standard delta function potential. For the standard delta function potential, there is always one bound state regardless of the strength. However, according to our condition, if d approaches infinity, then the condition becomes V₀ > (ħ² / 2 m d) which tends to zero. Therefore, for any V₀ > 0, there is a bound state, which matches the standard result. Therefore, our condition seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if d is very small, then ħ²/(2 m d) becomes large, so V₀ needs to be large to satisfy V₀ > ħ²/(2 m d). So if the infinite wall is very close to the delta function (small d), then the potential needs to be stronger (larger V₀) to have a bound state. This makes sense because the particle is confined to a smaller region, making it harder to localize, hence requiring a stronger attractive potential.\n\nTherefore, the rigorous condition is that V₀ must satisfy V₀ > ħ²/(2 m d). \n\nBut let me check the exact derivation again. The critical case is when α d = 1/2. Let me see if at α d = 1/2, there is exactly one solution or not.\n\nAt α d = 1/2, the derivative at κ=0 is 1 - 2*(α d) = 1 - 1 = 0. So the function f(κ) has a horizontal tangent at κ=0. In this case, we need to check if there is a solution. Let's suppose α d = 1/2. Let me set α = 1/(2d). Then the equation becomes:\n\nκ = α (1 - e^{-2 κ d}) = (1/(2d)) (1 - e^{-2 κ d})\n\nLet me set y = 2 κ d. Then κ = y/(2d). Substitute into the equation:\n\ny/(2d) = (1/(2d)) (1 - e^{-y})\n\nMultiply both sides by 2d:\n\ny = 1 - e^{-y}\n\nRearranged:\n\ny + e^{-y} = 1\n\nLet me solve this equation for y. Let me check y=0: 0 + 1 = 1, which satisfies the equation. So y=0 is a solution. But y=0 corresponds to κ=0. However, we need non-zero solutions. Let me check the derivative of the function g(y) = y + e^{-y} - 1.\n\ng'(y) = 1 - e^{-y}\n\nAt y=0, g'(0) = 1 - 1 = 0. The second derivative is g''(y) = e^{-y} > 0. Therefore, y=0 is a minimum. Since g(0) = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0, and the function has a minimum there, and for y > 0, g(y) increases. Therefore, the only solution is y=0. Therefore, when α d = 1/2, the only solution is κ=0, which corresponds to E=0, which is not a bound state. Therefore, the critical case α d = 1/2 does not yield a bound state. Therefore, the condition must be strict inequality: α d > 1/2, i.e., V₀ > ħ²/(2 m d).\n\nTherefore, the rigorous condition is that the product of V₀ and d must satisfy V₀ d > ħ²/(2m). \n\nBut let me check units to make sure. The units of V₀ should be energy × length, since the delta function potential has units of energy × length (because δ(x) has units of 1/length, so -V₀ δ(x) must have units of energy). Therefore, V₀ has units of energy × length. Then, V₀ d has units of energy × length². On the other hand, ħ²/(2m) has units of (J² s²)/(kg) = (kg² m^4/s² * s²)/kg) = kg m²/s² = J m². Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nħ has units of J·s. Then ħ²/(m) has units (J² s²)/kg. But J = kg m²/s², so substituting:\n\n( (kg² m^4 / s^4) * s² ) / kg ) = (kg m^4 / s²) / kg = m^4 / s². Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to check the units of the condition V₀ d > ħ²/(2m). \n\nLeft-hand side: V₀ [E·L] × d [L] = E·L²\n\nRight-hand side: ħ²/(2m) has units (J² s²)/kg. Let me express ħ in terms of energy and time. Since ħ has units of energy × time. Therefore, ħ² / mass has units (energy² × time²) / mass. Let me relate this to E·L²:\n\nLet me recall that [ħ²/(2m)] has units of energy × length². Because for example, in the kinetic energy term, (ħ²/(2m)) k² has units of energy, so ħ²/(2m) has units energy / k². Since k has units 1/length, then ħ²/(2m) has units energy × length². Therefore, yes, the right-hand side has units of energy × length². Therefore, the left-hand side V₀ d has units energy × length². Therefore, the inequality is dimensionally consistent.\n\nTherefore, the condition is V₀ d > ħ²/(2m). Therefore, the rigorous conditions are that V₀ and d must satisfy V₀ d > ħ²/(2m).\n\nBut let me recall that in the equation we had α = m V₀ / ħ², so α d > 1/2 => (m V₀ / ħ²) d > 1/2 => V₀ > ħ²/(2 m d). Yes, same thing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there must exist at least one bound state if V₀ exceeds the threshold value ħ²/(2 m d). Therefore, the rigorous conditions are that V₀ must be greater than ħ²/(2 m d).\n\nBut let me check with a specific example. Suppose d is very large. Then the threshold value is very small, so even a small V₀ would satisfy the condition. Which makes sense, because if the infinite wall is far away (large d), the delta function potential is in a large region, so it's easier to have a bound state. Conversely, if d is very small, the threshold is large, so V₀ needs to be large.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the product of V₀ and d must be greater than ħ²/(2m). Therefore, the condition is V₀ d > ħ²/(2m).\n\nBut the question says \"rigorous conditions must V₀ and d satisfy\". So the answer is that V₀ must be greater than ħ²/(2 m d). So written as:\n\nV₀ > \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m d}\n\nBut depending on the notation used in the course, sometimes ħ is written as ħ, or sometimes h-bar. Assuming standard notation, yes.\n\nTherefore, the rigorous condition is that the product of V₀ and the distance d must exceed ħ²/(2m). Therefore, the answer is that there must be at least one bound state if V₀ > ħ²/(2 m d).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe condition is that $ V_0 $ must satisfy $ V_0 > \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m d} $. Thus, the rigorous conditions are \\boxed{V_0 > \\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m d}}.\n</think>"}
