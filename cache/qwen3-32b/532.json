The question is about choosing the best star to observe at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. The key factors here are the observatory's location and airmass considerations. \n\nFirst, I remember that airmass is the amount of atmosphere the light from a celestial object has to pass through before reaching the observer. Lower airmass is better because it means less atmospheric interference, which leads to better observing conditions. Airmass is minimized when the object is directly overhead (at the zenith), and it increases as the object is lower on the horizon.\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is at 24°S latitude and 70°W longitude. So, the observatory is in the southern hemisphere. The declination of the stars will be important here because the declination relates to the observer's latitude. \n\nThe formula for the altitude of a star at its highest point (transit) is: altitude = 90° - |observer's latitude - star's declination|. But since the observer is at 24°S, their latitude is -24°. So, for a star with declination δ, the maximum altitude (when it's due south) would be 90° - |(-24°) - δ|. Let me simplify that. \n\nWait, maybe another way: The altitude at transit is given by altitude = 90° - |latitude - declination|. Since the latitude is -24°, we can plug that in. So for each star, we can calculate the maximum altitude and thus the airmass. Lower airmass corresponds to higher altitude (closer to the zenith).\n\nLet's go through each star:\n\nStar1: RA = 15 deg, Dec = -26 deg. Let's convert RA to hours if needed, but since RA isn't directly used in altitude calculation, maybe not. The declination is -26°. The latitude is -24°. So the difference between declination and latitude is |-26 - (-24)| = |-2| = 2 degrees. So altitude at transit is 90 - 2 = 88 degrees. That's very high, almost overhead. So airmass would be very low here. But wait, the formula is altitude = 90 - |latitude - declination|. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check. \n\nActually, the formula for the maximum altitude of a star is: altitude = 90° - |observer's latitude - star's declination|. So for Star1, observer's latitude is -24°, star's declination is -26°. So | -24 - (-26)| = |2| = 2 degrees. So altitude = 90 - 2 = 88°, which is correct. So that's a very high altitude, meaning low airmass.\n\nStar2: Dec = +14°. So | -24 - 14 | = |-38| = 38 degrees. Altitude = 90 - 38 = 52 degrees. That's lower than Star1, so higher airmass.\n\nStar3: Dec = -34°. | -24 - (-34)| = |10| = 10 degrees. Altitude = 90 - 10 = 80 degrees. So that's also high, but lower than Star1's 88°. So airmass is higher than Star1 but lower than Star2.\n\nStar4: RA is 5 hours, but RA isn't needed for altitude calculation. Declination is +70°. So | -24 - 70 | = |-94| = 94 degrees. Altitude = 90 - 94 = -4 degrees. Wait, negative altitude means the star never rises above the horizon from Paranal's location. Because the declination is +70°, and the latitude is -24°. So a star with declination +70° would be way north of the observer's position. Since the observer is at 24°S, the northern celestial pole is at 24° above the southern horizon. A star at +70° declination would be 70° north of the celestial equator. The observer's latitude is 24° south, so the maximum altitude of a star with +70° declination would be... Let me think again. The formula altitude = 90° - |observer's latitude - star's declination|. Wait, if the observer is at latitude -24°, and the star's declination is +70°, then | -24 - 70 | = 94°. So altitude = 90 - 94 = -4°, which is below the horizon. So Star4 is never visible from Paranal. Therefore, it's not a good candidate.\n\nSo the stars that are visible are Star1, Star2, Star3. Among these, Star1 has the highest altitude (88°), followed by Star3 (80°), then Star2 (52°). So the best in terms of airmass is Star1. But wait, the answer options are A to D. The options are A:Star2, B:Star4, C:Star3, D:Star1. So the correct answer should be D:Star1. But let me check again.\n\nWait, but the question says \"which of the following stars would you recommend for observation in terms of airmass\". So the one with the lowest airmass is best, which corresponds to the highest altitude. So Star1 is the best. But the options include Star4 as option B, which is not visible. So the answer is D:Star1. But let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation for Star3.\n\nStar3 has Dec = -34°. Observer's latitude is -24°. So | -24 - (-34)| = 10°. So altitude is 90 - 10 = 80°, which is correct. So Star1 is higher. So the best is Star1. Therefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
