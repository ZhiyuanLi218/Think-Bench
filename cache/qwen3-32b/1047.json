Let me recall the formula for gravitational force. I think the gravitational force on the surface of a planet is given by Newton's law of gravitation. The formula should be F = (G * M * m) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, m is the mass of the object, and r is the radius of the planet. \n\nSince we're looking for the ratio of the gravitational force on Mars to that on Earth, I can set up a ratio of the two forces. Let me denote F_mars / F_earth. \n\nGiven that the mass of Mars is 1/10 of Earth's mass, so M_mars = (1/10) M_earth. And the radius of Mars is 1/2 of Earth's radius, so r_mars = (1/2) r_earth. \n\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n\nF_mars / F_earth = [ (G * M_mars * m) / r_mars² ] / [ (G * M_earth * m) / r_earth² ]\n\nI notice that G and m will cancel out in numerator and denominator, so that simplifies things. Let me write that:\n\n= [ M_mars / r_mars² ] / [ M_earth / r_earth² ]\n= (M_mars / M_earth) * (r_earth² / r_mars²)\n\nNow plug in the given ratios:\n\nM_mars / M_earth = 1/10\n\nr_earth / r_mars = 2/1, so (r_earth / r_mars)² = (2)² = 4. Therefore, r_earth² / r_mars² = 4.\n\nSo multiplying those together: (1/10) * 4 = 4/10 = 0.4.\n\nLooking at the options, 0.4 is option B. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I messed up the reciprocal somewhere? Let me go through again.\n\nOriginal ratio: (M_mars/M_earth) * (r_earth / r_mars)^2. Yes, because it's divided by r_mars squared over r_earth squared. So yes, it's (r_earth squared divided by r_mars squared). Since r_mars is half of r_earth, then r_earth is twice r_mars, so squared is 4. Multiply by 1/10 gives 0.4. So yes, 0.4 is option B. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought maybe the ratio was (r_mars / r_earth)^2, but no, since when you invert the division, it becomes reciprocal. Let me make sure.\n\nOriginal formula after cancelling: [M_mars / r_mars² ] divided by [M_earth / r_earth² ] equals [M_mars / M_earth] * [r_earth² / r_mars²]. Yes, because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So that's correct. So the calculation is right.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, 0.4.\n</think>"}
