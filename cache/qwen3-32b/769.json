So, we have two stars, star_1 and star_2. The question is about their effective temperatures, T₁ and T₂. The key information given is that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between those levels is 1.38×10⁻²³ J. And we need to pick the correct equation from the options A to D that relates T₁ and T₂.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the population of energy levels in atoms relates to temperature. Since the problem mentions that the stellar photospheres are in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), I think the Saha equation or the Boltzmann distribution might come into play here. Wait, the Saha equation deals with ionization, right? Whereas the Boltzmann distribution deals with the distribution of particles among different energy levels. Since the question is about excitation levels (specific energy levels), probably the Boltzmann distribution is the right approach here.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference over kT. The formula is something like:\n\nN₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE/(kT))\n\nWhere N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the two energy levels, g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels, ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nBut in this problem, it's stated that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, maybe they are comparing the ratio N₂/N₁ for the same energy level in each star. Let me think.\n\nAssuming that the energy levels we're talking about are the same for both stars (since they're both iron atoms), the degeneracies g₂ and g₁ would be the same for both stars. Therefore, the ratio N₂/N₁ would be proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)) for each star. However, the problem states that the population of the specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, but which energy level are we talking about? Let me clarify.\n\nSuppose we have two energy levels, say level 1 and level 2. The problem mentions that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Let me assume that they mean that the population of a higher energy level (let's say level 2) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So N₂(star_1)/N₁(star_1) = 2 * [N₂(star_2)/N₁(star_2)] ?\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" So maybe it's the ratio of the population in that specific higher energy level to the lower one is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So if we denote the ratio for star_1 as (N_upper/N_lower)_1 and for star_2 as (N_upper/N_lower)_2, then (N_upper/N_lower)_1 = 2*(N_upper/N_lower)_2.\n\nGiven that, using the Boltzmann equation for each star, we can write:\n\nFor star_1: (N₂/N₁)_1 = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE/(k T₁))\n\nFor star_2: (N₂/N₁)_2 = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE/(k T₂))\n\nGiven that (N₂/N₁)_1 = 2*(N₂/N₁)_2, so:\n\n(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE/(k T₁)) = 2 * (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE/(k T₂))\n\nThe (g₂/g₁) terms cancel out on both sides, so:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T₂))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-ΔE/(k T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T₂)\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n-ΔE/(k T₁) + ΔE/(k T₂) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out ΔE/k:\n\nΔE/k [ -1/T₁ + 1/T₂ ] = ln(2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nΔE/k [ (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁ T₂) ) ] = ln(2)\n\nWait, let's do the algebra step by step.\n\nStarting from:\n\n-ΔE/(k T₁) + ΔE/(k T₂) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out ΔE/k:\n\nΔE/k [ -1/T₁ + 1/T₂ ] = ln(2)\n\nWhich is:\n\nΔE/k [ ( -T₂ + T₁ ) / (T₁ T₂) ) ] = ln(2)\n\nSo:\n\nΔE/k * (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁ T₂) ) = ln(2)\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nln(2) = ΔE/k * (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁ T₂)\n\nBut the problem gives us the value of ΔE as 1.38×10⁻²³ J. Let me check the value of Boltzmann's constant. Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K. Wait, that's interesting. The given ΔE is 1.38×10⁻²³ J, and k is also approximately 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K. So ΔE/k would be (1.38×10⁻²³ J) / (1.38×10⁻²³ J/K) ) = 1 K⁻¹? Wait, units:\n\nΔE has units of J, k is J/K, so ΔE/k has units of K. So ΔE/k is in Kelvin.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf ΔE is in J, and k is J/K, then ΔE/k has units of K. So ΔE/k is a temperature. Therefore, in the equation above, ln(2) equals ΔE/k multiplied by (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁ T₂). Let's write that:\n\nln(2) = [ΔE/k] * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ T₂) ]\n\nBut since ΔE/k is equal to 1.38×10⁻²³ J / 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K = 1 K. Because ΔE is given as 1.38×10⁻²³ J, and k is 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, ΔE/k = 1 K. Therefore, substituting that into the equation:\n\nln(2) = [1 K] * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ T₂) ]\n\nSo then:\n\nln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ T₂)\n\nLooking at the answer options, option D is ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ T₂) ]\n\nSo that would be option D. Let me check the options again:\n\nA: ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂)^2 ]\n\nB: ln(2) = [ T₂ / T₁ ]\n\nC: ln(2) = [ (T₁ + T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\nD: ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\nYes, D matches the equation we derived. So the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the derivation again.\n\nStarting with the Boltzmann equation:\n\n(N₂/N₁)_1 = 2*(N₂/N₁)_2\n\nAssuming same degeneracy ratios for both stars, so:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T₁)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T₂))\n\nTaking natural log:\n\n-ΔE/(k T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T₂)\n\nRearranging:\n\n-ΔE/(k T₁) + ΔE/(k T₂) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out ΔE/k:\n\nΔE/k [ -1/T₁ + 1/T₂ ] = ln(2)\n\nWhich is:\n\nΔE/k [ (T₂ - T₁)/(T₁ T₂) ) ] = ln(2)\n\nWait, hold on! Wait, -1/T₁ + 1/T₂ is equal to ( -T₂ + T₁ ) / (T₁ T₂ ) = (T₁ - T₂)/ (T₁ T₂ )\n\nYes, that's correct. So the numerator is T₁ - T₂. Therefore:\n\nΔE/k * (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁ T₂) ) = ln(2)\n\nSince ΔE/k is 1 K, then:\n\n1 K * (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁ T₂) ) = ln(2)\n\nBut the units here? Let's see:\n\n(T₁ - T₂) has units of K, T₁ T₂ has units of K². So (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁ T₂) is 1/K. Then multiplying by 1 K gives dimensionless, which matches ln(2), which is dimensionless. So the units check out.\n\nTherefore, the equation is ln(2) equals (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁ T₂), which is option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a possibility that I misapplied the Boltzmann equation. For example, maybe I should have considered the ratio of the upper level population to the lower level? But in the problem, it's stated that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the population of that specific higher energy level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Assuming that the lower level population is the same? No, that's not necessarily the case. The ratio of upper to lower depends on temperature. So the correct approach is to take the ratio N_upper/N_lower for each star and set the ratio for star_1 equal to twice that of star_2, which is what I did.\n\nAnother check: Let's suppose T₁ > T₂. Then (T₁ - T₂) is positive, so the right-hand side would be positive, and ln(2) is positive (~0.693), which makes sense. If T₁ < T₂, then the RHS would be negative, which would not equal ln(2), so that would not be possible. But given that higher temperature would lead to higher population in the upper energy level, so if star_1 has a higher population in that upper level, then T₁ should be higher than T₂. Therefore, (T₁ - T₂) is positive, which gives a positive value, matching ln(2). So that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think my derivation is correct, and the answer is D.\n</think>"}
