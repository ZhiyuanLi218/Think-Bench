In a system of particles (such as gas molecules), the **higher the temperature**, the **faster the particles move**, and hence, the **greater their average kinetic energy**.\n\nThis principle is especially clear in the **kinetic theory of gases**, where temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n- **(A)** *\"When the temperature of an object decreases, the average kinetic energy of its molecular thermal motion increases.\"*  \n  This is **incorrect**. A decrease in temperature corresponds to a **decrease** in the average kinetic energy of the particles.\n\n- **(B)** *\"When the temperature of an object increases, the average kinetic energy of its molecular thermal motion increases.\"*  \n  This is **correct**. As temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the particles also increases, in line with the principles of thermal physics.\n\n- **(C)** *\"When the temperature of an object decreases, its internal energy must increase.\"*  \n  This is **not necessarily true**. Internal energy is the **total energy** of the system, including both kinetic and potential energies. A decrease in temperature usually implies a **decrease** in internal energy, unless there is a phase change or other external energy input. So this statement is **not always true**.\n\n- **(D)** *\"When the temperature of an object remains constant, its internal energy must remain unchanged.\"*  \n  This is **also incorrect**. For example, during a **phase change** (e.g., melting or boiling), the temperature remains constant while the internal energy **increases** due to the absorption of latent heat.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAmong the four options, **only option (B)** correctly reflects the relationship between temperature and the average kinetic energy of molecular motion.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about which statement regarding temperature, kinetic energy, and internal energy is correct. The options are A through D. I need to figure out which one is right based on what I remember from physics.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. When the temperature increases, the particles move faster, so their kinetic energy should increase. So if the temperature goes up, the average kinetic energy goes up. That sounds like option B. Let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A says when temperature decreases, the average kinetic energy increases. That seems opposite. If the temperature is lower, the particles should be moving slower, so lower kinetic energy. So A is probably wrong.\n\nOption C states that when temperature decreases, internal energy must increase. Hmm. Internal energy is the total energy of all the particles, including kinetic and potential. If the temperature decreases, that might mean the kinetic energy is decreasing, but internal energy also depends on other factors like phase changes. For example, if a substance is melting, the temperature stays the same while the internal energy increases due to latent heat. But if the temperature is decreasing, like cooling down, then internal energy might be decreasing too. So C says internal energy must increase when temperature decreases, which doesn't seem right in general. Unless there's some specific scenario where that's true, but the question is about a general case. So C is likely incorrect.\n\nOption D: When temperature remains constant, internal energy must remain unchanged. Again, thinking about phase changes. For example, during melting or boiling, temperature stays constant, but the internal energy increases because heat is being added (latent heat). So even though temperature is constant, internal energy is changing. Therefore, D is not always true. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B. Let me just double-check. Temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in an ideal gas. For real substances, it's a bit more complex, but the general idea holds that increasing temperature means higher average kinetic energy. So B is correct.\n</think>"}
