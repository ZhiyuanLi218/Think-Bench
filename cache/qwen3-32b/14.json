The table gives percentages for each grade, and there are 300 males and 300 females surveyed in each grade. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. We have four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, there are 300 male students and 300 female students. The percentages in the table represent the percentage of each group (males and females) who ride the bus. The question is asking for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders in the same grade.\n\nSo, for each grade, I need to compute:\n\n- Number of male bus riders = 300 * (percentage for males)\n- Number of female bus riders = 300 * (percentage for females)\n- Then compute 135% of the number of female bus riders: 1.35 * (number of female bus riders)\n- Then find the difference between the number of male bus riders and this 135% value. The grade with the smallest difference is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do this with percentages directly, since the number of students is the same (300 each). Let me think.\n\nIf I consider the percentages, then:\n\nNumber of male bus riders = 300 * (M% / 100)\nNumber of female bus riders = 300 * (F% / 100)\n135% of female bus riders = 1.35 * 300 * (F% / 100) = 300 * 1.35 * (F% / 100)\n\nWe want Male riders ≈ 1.35 * Female riders, so:\n\n300 * (M% / 100) ≈ 300 * 1.35 * (F% / 100)\n\nDivide both sides by 300:\n\nM% / 100 ≈ 1.35 * F% / 100\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\nM% ≈ 1.35 * F%\n\nSo actually, if I just check for each grade whether the male percentage is approximately 1.35 times the female percentage, that would give me the same result. Therefore, I can avoid dealing with the actual numbers and just work with percentages.\n\nTherefore, for each grade, compute M% / F% and see which one is closest to 1.35. Alternatively, compute 1.35 * F% and compare it to M%.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me compute 1.35 times the female percentage for each grade and compare it to the male percentage. The grade where these two numbers are closest is the answer.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nFor 9th grade:\nFemale % = 39.4%\n1.35 * 39.4% = ?\n\nLet me calculate that. 39.4 * 1.35. Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 39.4 * 1.35.\n\nWell, 39.4 * 1 = 39.4\n\n39.4 * 0.35 = ?\n\nCompute 39.4 * 0.3 = 11.82\n\n39.4 * 0.05 = 1.97\n\nSo total 11.82 + 1.97 = 13.79\n\nSo total 1.35 * 39.4 = 39.4 + 13.79 = 53.19%\n\nMale % is 41.1%. So difference is 53.19 - 41.1 = 12.09 percentage points.\n\nFor 10th grade:\n\nFemale % = 33.1%\n\n1.35 * 33.1 = ?\n\nAgain, compute 33.1 * 1.35.\n\n33.1 * 1 = 33.1\n\n33.1 * 0.35 = ?\n\n33.1 * 0.3 = 9.93\n\n33.1 * 0.05 = 1.655\n\nTotal: 9.93 + 1.655 = 11.585\n\nTotal 1.35 * 33.1 = 33.1 + 11.585 = 44.685%\n\nMale % is 34.4%. Difference is 44.685 - 34.4 = 10.285 percentage points.\n\nFor 11th grade:\n\nFemale % = 13.8%\n\n1.35 * 13.8 = ?\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n13.8 * 1.35.\n\nAgain, 13.8 * 1 = 13.8\n\n13.8 * 0.35 = ?\n\n13.8 * 0.3 = 4.14\n\n13.8 * 0.05 = 0.69\n\nTotal: 4.14 + 0.69 = 4.83\n\nTotal 1.35 * 13.8 = 13.8 + 4.83 = 18.63%\n\nMale % is 20.6%. Difference is 20.6 - 18.63 = 1.97 percentage points.\n\nFor 12th grade:\n\nFemale % = 8.6%\n\n1.35 * 8.6 = ?\n\nCalculating:\n\n8.6 * 1.35.\n\n8.6 * 1 = 8.6\n\n8.6 * 0.35 = ?\n\n8.6 * 0.3 = 2.58\n\n8.6 * 0.05 = 0.43\n\nTotal: 2.58 + 0.43 = 3.01\n\nTotal 1.35 * 8.6 = 8.6 + 3.01 = 11.61%\n\nMale % is 11.6%. Difference is 11.61 - 11.6 = 0.01 percentage points.\n\nWait, that seems really close. Let me check my calculations again for 12th grade.\n\nFemale % is 8.6%, so 1.35 times that is 1.35 * 8.6.\n\nLet me compute 8.6 * 1.35:\n\nAnother way: 8.6 * 1.35 = 8.6 * (1 + 0.3 + 0.05) = 8.6 + 2.58 + 0.43 = 8.6 + 2.58 is 11.18 + 0.43 is 11.61. Yes, that's correct.\n\nMale % is 11.6%. So difference is 11.61 - 11.6 = 0.01%. That's very small.\n\nSo for each grade, the differences are:\n\n9th: ~12.09\n\n10th: ~10.285\n\n11th: ~1.97\n\n12th: ~0.01\n\nTherefore, the 12th grade has the smallest difference, so it is the closest. However, let me check again if I did the calculations correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check for 11th grade again. Male % is 20.6, 1.35*F% is 18.63. So difference is 20.6 - 18.63 = 1.97. Correct.\n\nFor 12th grade, male is 11.6, 1.35*F is 11.61. So difference is 0.01. So that is indeed much smaller.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\".\n\nBut since we did the percentages, but the actual numbers are 300 students. Let me check if there is a possibility that when converting percentages to actual numbers, the difference might change in terms of absolute numbers.\n\nWait, but since we are dealing with proportions, multiplying both sides by 300 would scale the difference by 300 as well. Therefore, the percentage difference corresponds directly to the actual number difference. For example, if the percentage difference is 1%, then the actual number difference is 300 * 1% = 3 students. Therefore, since we found that for 12th grade, the percentage difference is 0.01%, the actual difference is 300 * 0.01% = 0.03 students. Which is almost zero. Whereas for 11th grade, difference is 1.97%, so 300 * 1.97% = approx 5.91 students. So yes, 12th grade is closest.\n\nBut let me verify by actually computing the numbers.\n\nFor 12th grade:\n\nNumber of male bus riders: 11.6% of 300.\n\nCompute 10% of 300 is 30, 1.6% is 30*(1.6/10) = 4.8. So total 30 + 4.8 = 34.8? Wait, no. Wait 11.6% is 10% + 1.6%?\n\nWait 10% of 300 is 30, 1% is 3, so 1.6% is 4.8. Therefore, 11.6% is 30 + 4.8 = 34.8 male bus riders.\n\nNumber of female bus riders: 8.6% of 300. Similarly, 8% is 24, 0.6% is 1.8, so total 24 + 1.8 = 25.8.\n\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 25.8. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 1 * 25.8 = 25.8\n\n0.35 * 25.8 = ?\n\nWell, 0.3 * 25.8 = 7.74\n\n0.05 * 25.8 = 1.29\n\nTotal 7.74 + 1.29 = 9.03\n\nSo total 25.8 + 9.03 = 34.83\n\nNumber of male riders is 34.8. So difference is 34.83 - 34.8 = 0.03. So about 0.03 students. Which is indeed very close.\n\nFor 11th grade:\n\nMale riders: 20.6% of 300. Let's calculate that. 20% is 60, 0.6% is 1.8, so total 60 + 1.8 = 61.8? Wait no, 20.6% is 20% + 0.6%. 20% of 300 is 60, 0.6% is 1.8, so total 61.8. Wait, no: 20.6% is 20.6/100 * 300 = 20.6 * 3 = 61.8. Yes.\n\nFemale riders: 13.8% of 300. 10% is 30, 3% is 9, 0.8% is 2.4, so total 30 + 9 + 2.4 = 41.4. Alternatively, 13.8 * 3 = 41.4.\n\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 41.4. Let me compute that.\n\nAgain, 1 * 41.4 = 41.4\n\n0.35 * 41.4 = ?\n\n0.3 * 41.4 = 12.42\n\n0.05 * 41.4 = 2.07\n\nTotal: 12.42 + 2.07 = 14.49\n\nTotal: 41.4 + 14.49 = 55.89\n\nNumber of male riders is 61.8, so difference is 61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91. Which is about 5.91 students. Which is much bigger than 0.03. Therefore, 12th grade is much closer.\n\nFor 10th grade:\n\nMale riders: 34.4% of 300. 34.4 * 3 = 103.2\n\nFemale riders: 33.1% of 300. 33.1 * 3 = 99.3\n\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 99.3 = ?\n\nCompute 1 * 99.3 = 99.3\n\n0.35 * 99.3 = ?\n\nWell, 0.3 * 99.3 = 29.79\n\n0.05 * 99.3 = 4.965\n\nTotal: 29.79 + 4.965 = 34.755\n\nTotal: 99.3 + 34.755 = 134.055\n\nMale riders: 103.2. Difference is 134.055 - 103.2 = 30.855. Which is way bigger.\n\nFor 9th grade:\n\nMale riders: 41.1% of 300 = 41.1 * 3 = 123.3\n\nFemale riders: 39.4% of 300 = 39.4 * 3 = 118.2\n\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 118.2 = ?\n\nCompute 1 * 118.2 = 118.2\n\n0.35 * 118.2:\n\n0.3 * 118.2 = 35.46\n\n0.05 * 118.2 = 5.91\n\nTotal: 35.46 + 5.91 = 41.37\n\nTotal: 118.2 + 41.37 = 159.57\n\nDifference: 159.57 - 123.3 = 36.27. Also way bigger.\n\nTherefore, the differences in actual numbers are 36.27, 30.855, 5.91, and 0.03. So clearly, 12th grade is the closest.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The question says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\". In the 12th grade, the male riders are 34.8 and 135% of female riders is 34.83. So male riders are slightly less than 135% of female riders. But the question is about \"closest to\". So even though it's slightly less, the difference is minimal. So 12th grade is the answer.\n\nBut let me check once again if I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFor 12th grade:\n\nMale percentage: 11.6%, so 0.116 * 300 = 34.8\n\nFemale percentage: 8.6%, so 0.086 * 300 = 25.8\n\n135% of female riders: 25.8 * 1.35. Let me compute 25.8 * 1.35.\n\nFirst, note that 25 * 1.35 = 33.75, and 0.8 * 1.35 = 1.08. Therefore, 25.8 * 1.35 = 33.75 + 1.08 = 34.83. Yes, that's correct. So 34.83 vs. 34.8. The difference is 0.03. Which is 0.03 students. Since we can't have fractions of students, but since the question is about the actual number, which is a real number (since it's an average or something?), so 0.03 is very small.\n\nTherefore, 12th grade is the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's a possibility that maybe I miscalculated for another grade? For example, maybe 11th grade?\n\nMale riders: 20.6% of 300 is 61.8\n\nFemale riders: 13.8% of 300 is 41.4\n\n135% of female riders is 41.4 * 1.35 = 55.89, as above. The male riders are 61.8, so difference is 61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91. Which is about 6 students difference. Which is way bigger than 0.03.\n\nTherefore, 12th grade is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and perhaps get confused.\n\nAnother way: Maybe someone would think that 135% implies that males are 135% of females, so they might set up equations for each grade.\n\nBut that's exactly what I did. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, someone might try to calculate for each grade the ratio of male to female riders and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nLet me try that approach as a check.\n\nFor each grade, compute Male% / Female%, then see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nFor 9th grade: 41.1 / 39.4 ≈ let's calculate.\n\nDivide 41.1 / 39.4.\n\nWell, 39.4 * 1.04 ≈ 39.4 + 1.576 = 40.976, which is close to 41.1. So approx 1.04. So roughly 1.04, which is way less than 1.35.\n\nFor 10th grade: 34.4 / 33.1 ≈ 1.039. Also way less than 1.35.\n\nFor 11th grade: 20.6 / 13.8 ≈ let me compute. 13.8 * 1.5 = 20.7. So 20.6 / 13.8 ≈ 1.5 - 0.1/13.8 ≈ 1.5 - 0.007 ≈ 1.493. So approximately 1.493. Which is close to 1.5, which is higher than 1.35. The difference between 1.493 and 1.35 is about 0.143.\n\nFor 12th grade: 11.6 / 8.6 ≈ let me calculate. 8.6 * 1.35 = 11.61, as before. Therefore, 11.6 / 8.6 ≈ 1.35 - (0.01 / 8.6). Since 8.6 * 1.35 = 11.61, so 11.6 is 0.01 less. Therefore, the ratio is 1.35 - (0.01 / 8.6). Let me compute 0.01 / 8.6 ≈ 0.00116. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 1.35 - 0.00116 ≈ 1.3488. Which is very close to 1.35. Therefore, the ratio Male / Female ≈ 1.3488, which is very close to 1.35. The difference is about 0.00116, which is much smaller than the difference in 11th grade, which was about 0.143. Therefore, 12th grade is much closer.\n\nTherefore, this method also confirms that 12th grade is the answer.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the correct answer is 12th grade.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe grade for which the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders is \\boxed{12}.\n</think>"}
