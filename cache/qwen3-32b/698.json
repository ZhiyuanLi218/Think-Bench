I need to figure out the form of the particle's wave function with respect to r, given the probability conditions. The problem states that the probability of finding the particle between d1 and 2d1 is P, and the same between 2d1 and 3d1. The wave function is time-independent, spherically symmetric, and has no imaginary part. The outer sphere radius is 100 times the inner one, but I'm not sure how that plays in yet.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is given by the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over that region. Since the wave function is spherically symmetric and real, the probability density should depend only on r. For a spherically symmetric wave function, the probability density is |ψ(r)|² times the volume element. In spherical coordinates, the volume element for a spherical shell between r and r+dr is 4πr²dr. So the probability of finding the particle between r and r+dr is 4πr²|ψ(r)|² dr.\n\nThe problem says that the probability between d1 and 2d1 is P, and between 2d1 and 3d1 is also P. Since the total probability should add up to some value, maybe these are equal parts of the total probability? But the problem doesn't specify the total probability, just that these two intervals have equal probabilities. So I need to find ψ(r) such that the integral of 4πr²|ψ(r)|² dr from d1 to 2d1 equals the integral from 2d1 to 3d1.\n\nLet me denote the probability density as P(r) = 4πr²|ψ(r)|². The problem states that the integral of P(r) dr from d1 to 2d1 is equal to the integral from 2d1 to 3d1. So:\n\n∫_{d1}^{2d1} P(r) dr = ∫_{2d1}^{3d1} P(r) dr\n\nBut P(r) is 4πr²|ψ(r)|². So:\n\n∫_{d1}^{2d1} 4πr²|ψ(r)|² dr = ∫_{2d1}^{3d1} 4πr²|ψ(r)|² dr\n\nAssuming that the wave function is such that these integrals are equal. Let me think about what form of ψ(r) would make these integrals equal.\n\nLet me suppose that ψ(r) is proportional to some power of r. Let's assume ψ(r) = A r^n, where A is a normalization constant and n is an exponent we need to find. Then |ψ(r)|² = A² r^{2n}.\n\nSo P(r) = 4πr² * A² r^{2n} = 4πA² r^{2n + 2}\n\nThen the integral from a to b of P(r) dr is 4πA² ∫_{a}^{b} r^{2n + 2} dr\n\nLet me compute the integrals for the two regions.\n\nFirst integral from d1 to 2d1:\n\nIntegral1 = 4πA² [ r^{2n + 3} / (2n + 3) ] evaluated from d1 to 2d1\n\nSimilarly, Integral2 from 2d1 to 3d1:\n\nIntegral2 = 4πA² [ r^{2n + 3} / (2n + 3) ] evaluated from 2d1 to 3d1\n\nSince the problem states Integral1 = Integral2, so:\n\n[ ( (2d1)^{2n + 3} - d1^{2n + 3} ) ] = [ ( (3d1)^{2n + 3} - (2d1)^{2n + 3} ) ]\n\nBecause the 4πA²/(2n + 3) cancels out on both sides.\n\nLet me factor out d1^{2n + 3}:\n\nLeft side: d1^{2n + 3} [ (2)^{2n + 3} - 1 ]\n\nRight side: d1^{2n + 3} [ 3^{2n + 3} - 2^{2n + 3} ]\n\nDivide both sides by d1^{2n + 3}:\n\n(2^{2n + 3} - 1) = (3^{2n + 3} - 2^{2n + 3})\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2^{2n + 3} - 1 = 3^{2n + 3} - 2^{2n + 3}\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2^{2n + 3} - 1 - 3^{2n + 3} + 2^{2n + 3} = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2*2^{2n + 3} - 1 - 3^{2n + 3} = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n2^{2n + 4} - 3^{2n + 3} - 1 = 0\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me go back.\n\nOriginal equation after dividing by d1^{...}:\n\n2^{2n + 3} - 1 = 3^{2n + 3} - 2^{2n + 3}\n\nSo moving terms:\n\n2^{2n + 3} + 2^{2n + 3} = 3^{2n + 3} + 1\n\nWhich is:\n\n2*2^{2n + 3} = 3^{2n + 3} + 1\n\nWhich is:\n\n2^{2n + 4} = 3^{2n + 3} + 1\n\nThis is a transcendental equation in n, which might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I need to try specific values for n from the given options.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA: r² → ψ(r) ~ r² → n=2\n\nB: 1/r² → ψ(r) ~ 1/r² → n=-2\n\nC: r → ψ(r) ~ r → n=1\n\nD: 1/r → ψ(r) ~ 1/r → n=-1\n\nLet me test each option.\n\nOption A: n=2\n\nCompute 2^{2*2 + 4} = 2^{8} = 256\n\nRight side: 3^{2*2 +3} +1 = 3^7 +1 = 2187 +1 = 2188\n\n256 ≠ 2188. Not equal. So A is out.\n\nOption B: n=-2\n\nLeft side: 2^{-4 + 4} = 2^0 = 1\n\nRight side: 3^{-4 +3} +1 = 3^{-1} +1 = 1/3 +1 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333...\n\nNot equal. So B is out.\n\nOption C: n=1\n\nLeft side: 2^{2*1 +4} = 2^6 = 64\n\nRight side: 3^{2*1 +3} +1 = 3^5 +1 = 243 +1 = 244. Not equal. C is out.\n\nOption D: n=-1\n\nLeft side: 2^{2*(-1) +4} = 2^{-2 +4} = 2^2 = 4\n\nRight side: 3^{2*(-1) +3} +1 = 3^{1} +1 = 3 +1 = 4. Oh! Equal!\n\nSo 4=4. So this works. Therefore, n=-1, which means ψ(r) is proportional to 1/r. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nFor n=-1:\n\nLeft side: 2^{2*(-1) + 3} - 1 = 2^{1} -1 = 2 -1 =1\n\nRight side: 3^{2*(-1)+3} - 2^{2*(-1)+3} = 3^{1} - 2^{1} = 3 -2 =1. Yes, so 1=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the equation holds when n=-1. Therefore, ψ(r) ~ 1/r. So answer D.\n\nBut let me think again. The wave function is ψ(r), and the probability density is |ψ(r)|² times 4πr². If ψ(r) is proportional to 1/r, then |ψ(r)|² is 1/r², and multiplying by 4πr² gives 4π/r² * r² = 4π, a constant? Wait, no. Wait:\n\nWait, P(r) dr = 4πr² |ψ(r)|² dr. If ψ(r) ~ 1/r, then |ψ(r)|² ~ 1/r². So P(r) ~ 4πr²*(1/r²) = 4π. So P(r) is constant? Then the integral over any interval would be proportional to the length of the interval. But in our problem, the two intervals (d1 to 2d1 and 2d1 to 3d1) both have length d1. So if P(r) is constant, then the integrals would be equal. Which matches the given condition. Therefore, if ψ(r) is proportional to 1/r, then the probability of finding the particle in any interval of length d1 (between multiples of d1) would be the same. So that works. Therefore, answer D.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the probability between d1 and 2d1 is P, and same between 2d1 and 3d1. If P(r) is constant, then the probability would depend on the width of the interval. Since both intervals are of width d1, they have the same probability. So yes, that works. Therefore, the wave function is proportional to 1/r. So answer D.\n\nBut let me check another way. Suppose ψ(r) is proportional to 1/r. Then the radial probability density is 4πr² |ψ(r)|². Let me compute that. Let’s say ψ(r) = A / r. Then |ψ(r)|² = A² / r². Multiply by 4πr²: 4πA². So the radial probability density is constant. Therefore, the probability of finding the particle between r1 and r2 is 4πA² (r2 - r1). So if the intervals are of equal length, the probabilities are equal. In our problem, the intervals from d1 to 2d1 and 2d1 to 3d1 both have length d1, so same probability. So this fits. Therefore, answer D.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the particle can exist between an outer and inner sphere, with outer radius 100 times inner. But does that affect the answer? The problem says that the probability between d1 and 2d1 is P, and same between 2d1 and 3d1. The rest of the space (up to 100d1) isn't mentioned. But since the question is only about the form of the wave function, and given the conditions on those two intervals, we can deduce that the radial probability density must be constant in those regions. But if the wave function is 1/r, then the radial probability density is constant throughout the entire region (assuming ψ(r) is 1/r in the entire region between d1 and 100d1). However, we need to check if such a wave function is physically possible. For example, in quantum mechanics, the radial wave function for certain potentials can have forms like 1/r, but we also have to consider boundary conditions. The wave function must be finite and square-integrable over the entire region.\n\nIf ψ(r) is proportional to 1/r, then integrating |ψ(r)|² over all space (from d1 to 100d1) would be ∫ (A² / r²) * 4πr² dr from d1 to 100d1 = 4πA² ∫ dr from d1 to 100d1 = 4πA² (100d1 - d1) = 4πA² *99d1. Which is finite, so it's square-integrable. So that works. Therefore, answer D is valid.\n\nAlternatively, if the wave function were proportional to r, then the radial probability density would be 4πr²*(A² r²) = 4πA² r^4, which would not give equal probabilities for the two intervals. Similarly for other options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 1/r.\n</think>"}
