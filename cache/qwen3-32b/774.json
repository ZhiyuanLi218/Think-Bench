So, the question is about adding 100 mL of 3 mol/L HCl to 2.8 g of Fe, and Fe completely dissolves. Then we have four options (A to D) and need to determine which one is correct. Alright, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the reaction between iron (Fe) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). From what I remember, when a metal reacts with an acid, it usually produces a salt and hydrogen gas. In this case, iron reacting with HCl should produce iron chloride and hydrogen gas. The specific reaction depends on the oxidation state of iron. I think iron can form either Fe²+ or Fe³+ ions, but with HCl, which is a relatively dilute acid, I believe it forms Fe²+ because HCl isn't a strong enough oxidizing agent to produce Fe³+. So the reaction is probably:\n\nFe(s) + 2HCl(aq) → FeCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)\n\nLet me check the stoichiometry here. Iron is oxidized from 0 to +2, and hydrogen is reduced from +1 to 0. Each Fe atom loses 2 electrons, and each H+ gains 1 electron. So for every Fe atom, two H+ ions are reduced. So the stoichiometric ratio is 1 mole of Fe to 2 moles of HCl, producing 1 mole of FeCl₂ and 1 mole of H₂ gas. That seems right.\n\nNow, the problem gives me specific quantities: 100 mL of 3 mol/L HCl and 2.8 g of Fe. I need to check if Fe is in excess or if HCl is the limiting reagent. Because the problem states that Fe completely dissolves, so all of the Fe is consumed. Therefore, HCl must be in sufficient quantity to react with all the Fe. Let me verify that.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of Fe. The molar mass of Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. The given mass is 2.8 g. So moles of Fe = 2.8 g / 55.85 g/mol ≈ 0.05 mol. Let me compute that more accurately. 2.8 divided by 55.85. Let's see, 55.85 times 0.05 is 2.7925 g. So 2.8 g is approximately 0.05 mol. Let me check with a calculator: 2.8 / 55.85 ≈ 0.0501 mol. So approximately 0.05 moles of Fe.\n\nNow, moles of HCl. The concentration is 3 mol/L, and volume is 0.1 L. So moles of HCl = 3 * 0.1 = 0.3 mol. According to the reaction, each mole of Fe requires 2 moles of HCl. So for 0.05 mol Fe, we need 0.1 mol HCl. Since we have 0.3 mol HCl, which is more than enough, HCl is in excess and Fe is the limiting reagent. Therefore, all Fe will dissolve, as stated.\n\nNow let's look at the options.\n\nOption A: The reaction transfers 0.1 mol of electrons.\n\nWell, in the reaction, each Fe atom loses 2 electrons. If there's 0.05 mol Fe, then total electrons transferred is 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol. So that would make option A correct? Wait, but let me confirm. The oxidation half-reaction is Fe → Fe²+ + 2e⁻. So per mole Fe, 2 moles of electrons are transferred. So for 0.05 mol Fe, 0.1 mol electrons. So A is correct? But let me check the other options as well because the question says \"the following statement is correct\" and there might be more than one correct? Wait, no, in multiple choice questions like this, usually only one is correct. Let me check all options.\n\nOption B: The number of Cl⁻ in HCl solution is 3 N_A.\n\nOriginal HCl solution is 3 mol/L, 0.1 L, so 0.3 mol HCl. Assuming HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely, so each HCl gives one Cl⁻ ion. Therefore, moles of Cl⁻ is 0.3 mol. The number of Cl⁻ ions is 0.3 N_A. But option B says 3 N_A. That's 10 times more. So B is incorrect. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: The number of neutrons in 2.8 g of ⁵⁶Fe is 1.3 N_A.\n\nOkay, ⁵⁶Fe. The isotope notation ⁵⁶Fe means the mass number is 56. The atomic number of Fe is 26 (since Fe is element 26). Therefore, number of neutrons per atom is 56 - 26 = 30. So each ⁵⁶Fe atom has 30 neutrons. Now, how many moles of ⁵⁶Fe are in 2.8 g?\n\nThe molar mass of ⁵⁶Fe is 56 g/mol. So moles of Fe is 2.8 g / 56 g/mol = 0.05 mol. Then, number of neutrons is moles * Avogadro's number * neutrons per atom. So 0.05 mol * 30 * N_A = 1.5 N_A. But option C says 1.3 N_A. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"2.8 g Fe\" but specifies it's ⁵⁶Fe? Wait, the option C says \"2.8 g ⁵⁶Fe\". Let me check the wording. Option C says: \"The number of neutrons contained in 2.8 g ⁵⁶Fe is 1.3 N_A\". So yes, it's ⁵⁶Fe. So molar mass is 56 g/mol. 2.8 g / 56 g/mol = 0.05 mol. Each mole has 30 neutrons. So 0.05 * 30 = 1.5 mol of neutrons. So number of neutrons is 1.5 N_A. But option C says 1.3 N_A. So that's incorrect. Therefore, option C is wrong. So why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I miscalculated? Let me check again.\n\nWait, 56 - 26 = 30. Correct. 2.8 / 56 = 0.05 mol. 0.05 * 30 = 1.5. So 1.5 N_A. So option C is wrong. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: The reaction generates 3.36 L of gas under standard conditions.\n\nStandard conditions are usually 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L. From the reaction, each mole of Fe produces 1 mole of H2 gas. Since we have 0.05 mol Fe, we should get 0.05 mol H2. Volume would be 0.05 * 22.4 L = 1.12 L. But option D says 3.36 L, which is 0.15 mol * 22.4 L. Wait, why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If the reaction is Fe + 2HCl → FeCl₂ + H₂. So 1 mole Fe gives 1 mole H₂. So 0.05 mol Fe gives 0.05 mol H₂. Volume is 0.05 * 22.4 = 1.12 L. But option D says 3.36 L. 3.36 L divided by 22.4 L/mol is 0.15 mol. So why is there a difference? Is there a mistake in my reaction?\n\nWait, maybe I got the wrong reaction? Let me check again. Iron can react with HCl to produce FeCl₂ and H₂. Let me confirm the balanced equation:\n\nFe + 2HCl → FeCl₂ + H₂. Yes, that's balanced. 1 Fe, 2 H, 2 Cl on both sides. So yes, 1 mole Fe gives 1 mole H2. So 0.05 mol Fe gives 0.05 mol H2. 0.05 * 22.4 = 1.12 L. Therefore, option D is incorrect. But why does option D say 3.36 L? 3.36 is 0.15 mol. Maybe the problem assumes that Fe is in excess and HCl is limiting? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, earlier I said that HCl is in excess. Let's verify. Moles of HCl is 0.3 mol. The reaction requires 2 moles HCl per mole Fe. If Fe is 0.05 mol, then required HCl is 0.1 mol. Since we have 0.3 mol, HCl is in excess. Therefore, Fe is the limiting reagent, so H2 produced is 0.05 mol. Therefore, D is wrong. So why is option D given as an option? Maybe there's a miscalculation here?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not using standard conditions? No, the question says \"under standard conditions\". So 22.4 L/mol. So 0.05 * 22.4 = 1.12 L. So D is incorrect. Then, according to my analysis, only option A is correct. But let me check again.\n\nWait, option A says the reaction transfers 0.1 mol of electrons. As per earlier, each Fe loses 2 electrons. 0.05 mol Fe * 2 = 0.1 mol electrons. So that's correct. So A is correct. But let me check again if there is any possibility of another answer.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of moles of Fe? Let me recalculate. The mass of Fe is 2.8 g. The molar mass of Fe is approximately 55.85 g/mol. So 2.8 divided by 55.85. Let me do this more accurately. 55.85 times 0.05 is 2.7925 g. The given mass is 2.8 g, which is 2.8 - 2.7925 = 0.0075 g more. So 0.0075 g / 55.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000134 mol. So total moles of Fe is approximately 0.05 + 0.000134 ≈ 0.050134 mol. So approximately 0.05 mol. So even with precise calculation, it's roughly 0.05 mol. Therefore, 0.05 mol * 2 = 0.1 mol electrons. So A is correct.\n\nBut let me check if the problem is considering Fe³+? If somehow the reaction produces Fe³+ instead of Fe²+, then the electrons transferred would be different. For example, if Fe → Fe³+ + 3e⁻, then electrons would be 0.05 * 3 = 0.15 mol. But in that case, the reaction would need more HCl. Let me think. If Fe is oxidized to Fe³+, then the reaction would be:\n\nFe + 6HCl → 2FeCl₃ + 3H₂?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The oxidation of Fe to Fe³+ would require more H+? Let me write the half-reactions.\n\nOxidation: Fe → Fe³+ + 3e⁻\n\nReduction: 2H+ + 2e⁻ → H₂(g)\n\nTo balance electrons, multiply oxidation by 2 and reduction by 3:\n\n2Fe → 2Fe³+ + 6e⁻\n\n6H+ + 6e⁻ → 3H₂\n\nSo overall reaction: 2Fe + 6HCl → 2FeCl₃ + 3H₂\n\nBut in this case, the stoichiometry is 2 moles Fe reacting with 6 moles HCl. However, HCl is 3 mol/L * 0.1 L = 0.3 mol. So for 2 moles Fe, need 6 moles HCl. For 0.05 mol Fe, need (6/2)*0.05 = 0.15 mol HCl. But we have 0.3 mol HCl, which is sufficient. However, if Fe is oxidized to Fe³+, then the amount of HCl required is 0.15 mol, which is less than 0.3 mol, so HCl is still in excess. Then, in this case, electrons transferred would be 0.05 mol Fe * 3 = 0.15 mol. But then, which reaction is correct?\n\nBut the problem states that Fe completely dissolves. However, in reality, when Fe reacts with dilute HCl, it usually forms FeCl₂, not FeCl₃. FeCl₃ would require a stronger oxidizing agent. So unless the problem is assuming something different, the correct reaction is Fe²+.\n\nBut let me check the problem again. The problem says \"Fe completely dissolves\". If the reaction were to Fe³+, then the amount of HCl required is 0.15 mol, which is still less than 0.3 mol. So Fe would still completely dissolve. However, the electrons transferred would be 0.15 mol. But in that case, option A (0.1 mol) would be wrong. But how do we know which reaction is correct?\n\nThis is a critical point. The problem might be expecting the Fe²+ reaction, but if someone assumes Fe³+, then the answer changes. How can we determine which one is correct?\n\nIn standard chemistry, the reaction between iron and dilute HCl is:\n\nFe(s) + 2HCl(aq) → FeCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)\n\nTherefore, the correct oxidation state is +2. Hence, the electrons transferred is 0.1 mol, making option A correct. However, if the problem assumes Fe³+, then option A would be wrong. But given that HCl is not a strong oxidizing agent, the reaction should produce Fe²+.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is correct. Let me check again the options. If A is correct, then others are incorrect as we discussed.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other factors. For example, maybe the problem is in a different context where Fe is oxidized to +3? But without more information, the standard reaction is to Fe²+.\n\nTherefore, I think A is correct. Let me check again the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: Number of Cl⁻ is 3 N_A. We have 0.3 mol HCl, so 0.3 N_A Cl⁻. Option B says 3 N_A, which is 10 times more. So definitely wrong.\n\nOption C: Neutrons in ⁵⁶Fe. As calculated, it's 1.5 N_A, but option says 1.3. So wrong.\n\nOption D: Gas volume. As per Fe²+ reaction, 0.05 mol H2, 1.12 L. Option D says 3.36 L, which is three times as much. If the reaction were producing 0.15 mol H2 (as in Fe³+ case), then 0.15 * 22.4 = 3.36 L. So if someone incorrectly assumes the Fe³+ reaction, they might think D is correct. However, since the correct reaction produces Fe²+, D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, only option A is correct. But let me check once more for calculation errors.\n\nMolar mass of Fe: 55.85 g/mol. 2.8 g / 55.85 g/mol ≈ 0.05 mol. Correct.\n\nHCl moles: 0.3 mol. Correct.\n\nReaction stoichiometry: 1 Fe : 2 HCl : 1 FeCl2 : 1 H2. Correct.\n\nElectrons transferred per Fe: 2. So 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol. Correct. So A is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The problem says \"the following statement is correct\". So maybe there is another correct option? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe option C. Let me recalculate. The problem says \"the number of neutrons contained in 2.8 g ⁵⁶Fe is 1.3 N_A\". Let me recalculate.\n\nMolar mass of ⁵⁶Fe is 56 g/mol. 2.8 g / 56 g/mol = 0.05 mol. Each ⁵⁶Fe has 56 - 26 = 30 neutrons. So total neutrons is 0.05 mol * 30 = 1.5 mol. So number of neutrons is 1.5 N_A. Option C says 1.3 N_A. So that's incorrect. So C is wrong. Therefore, no.\n\nIs there any other possibility? For example, maybe the problem is considering natural iron, not ⁵⁶Fe? But option C specifically says ⁵⁶Fe. So no, that's not it.\n\nTherefore, only option A is correct. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check once more for any possible mistakes. For example, in the calculation of electrons transferred. The oxidation reaction is Fe → Fe²+ + 2e⁻. So yes, 2 electrons per Fe. 0.05 mol Fe gives 0.1 mol e⁻. So A is correct. Yes.\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
