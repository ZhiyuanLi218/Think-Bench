First, I need to recall what 2-phenylpropene is. The structure should be a propene (which is CH₂=CHCH₃) with a phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to the second carbon. So the structure is CH₂=C(CH₃)-C₆H₅. Wait, actually, propene is CH₂=CH₂CH₃, but when you attach a phenyl group to the second carbon, it would be CH₂=C(CH₂Ph)? No, wait. The IUPAC name is 2-phenylpropene. Let me think. Propene is CH₂=CHCH₃. The phenyl group is on the second carbon. So the correct structure is CH₂=C(C₆H₅)CH₃? No, wait. If it's 2-phenylpropene, the phenyl is on carbon 2 of the propene chain. So the propene chain is three carbons: carbon 1 is CH₂, carbon 2 is CH, and carbon 3 is CH₃. But with a double bond between carbon 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂Ph? No, because if the phenyl is on carbon 2, which is the central carbon in the double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH₂=C(CH₂Ph)CH₃? Or maybe it's CH₂=C(C₆H₅)CH₃? That would be 2-phenylpropene. So the central carbon of the double bond has a phenyl group attached. So the structure is CH₂=C(C₆H₅)CH₃. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Cannot decolorize dilute potassium permanganate solution. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in dilute solution is an oxidizing agent. For alkenes, KMnO4 can cause oxidation, leading to cleavage of the double bond. If the compound has a double bond, it can decolorize KMnO4. Since 2-phenylpropene has a double bond, it should decolorize KMnO4. Therefore, option A says it cannot decolorize, which would be incorrect. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B: Can undergo addition polymerization. Alkenes can undergo addition polymerization. Since 2-phenylpropene has a double bond, it should be able to polymerize. For example, styrene (which is similar, with a phenyl group on the second carbon of a propene) polymerizes to form polystyrene. So 2-phenylpropene would also undergo addition polymerization. So option B is correct.\n\nOption C: All atoms in the molecule are coplanar. Let's think about the structure. The molecule has a benzene ring (phenyl group) and a double bond. In alkenes, the double bond is planar with trigonal geometry. The phenyl group is also planar. However, the question is whether all atoms are in the same plane. The central carbon of the double bond is attached to the phenyl group. The phenyl group is a benzene ring, which is planar. The double bond (C=C) is also planar. However, the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the terminal carbon of the double bond would be in a different plane. Wait, the structure is CH₂=C(C₆H₅)CH₃. The central carbon (C2) is connected to the phenyl group. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The C1 is CH₂, C2 is CH with the phenyl and the CH₃ group. Wait, actually, maybe I need to draw it out mentally. Let me clarify the structure again. The correct structure is CH₂=C(CH₂Ph)CH₃? Or CH₂=C(C₆H₅)CH₃? The latter. So the central carbon (C2) is connected to the phenyl group, and the terminal carbons are CH₂ and CH₃. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The geometry around the double bond is planar. The phenyl group is attached to C2. So the phenyl ring is in a plane, and the double bond is in a plane. However, whether all atoms are coplanar depends on the spatial arrangement. The methyl group (CH₃) on C3 is a single bond, so it can rotate. However, the molecule's overall planarity is affected by the double bond and the phenyl group. The phenyl ring is in the same plane as the double bond? Because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the phenyl is on C2. The phenyl ring is attached to C2, which is part of the double bond. In such a case, the phenyl ring can be in the same plane as the double bond. However, the methyl group on C3 (the CH₃) is a single bond, so it can be out of plane. Therefore, not all atoms are coplanar. The hydrogen atoms on the CH₂ and the CH₃ groups would be out of plane. So option C is incorrect. Therefore, C is wrong.\n\nOption D: Easily soluble in water and toluene. Solubility in water depends on the polarity. 2-phenylpropene is a nonpolar molecule because it's an alkene with a benzene ring. Water is polar, so nonpolar substances are not soluble in water. Therefore, it would not be easily soluble in water. Toluene is a nonpolar solvent, so it should be soluble in toluene. So option D says it's easily soluble in both, which is incorrect because it's not soluble in water. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct options are B. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for option C: All atoms in the molecule are coplanar. The structure is CH₂=C(C₆H₅)CH₃. The double bond is between the first and second carbon. The phenyl is attached to the second carbon. The phenyl ring is in the same plane as the double bond? Let me think about the geometry. The double bond has a trigonal planar geometry. The phenyl group is attached to the second carbon (C2), which is part of the double bond. The phenyl ring's plane would be in the same plane as the double bond. However, the methyl group (CH₃) on the third carbon (C3) is a single bond, so it can be in any direction. Therefore, the hydrogen atoms on the methyl group are not coplanar. The CH₂ group on C1 is also part of the double bond's plane. So the atoms in the double bond and the phenyl ring are coplanar, but the methyl group's hydrogens are not. Therefore, not all atoms are coplanar. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption B is correct because it can polymerize. So the correct answer is B.\n</think>"}
