Let me start by recalling what I know about isospin and Pauli matrices.\n\nFirst, protons and neutrons are considered as two states of a nucleon with isospin 1/2. The isospin operators ti for each nucleon are analogous to spin-1/2 operators, represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by 1/2. The total isospin T is the sum of all individual ti's. So, T = t1 + t2 + ... + tN.\n\nNow, the problem is about expressing the sum of ti·tj over all i > j in terms of the total isospin T. I remember that for spin systems, there's a similar identity where the sum of Si·Sj over pairs can be related to the total spin squared. Maybe this is analogous?\n\nLet me recall that identity. For spin, the total squared spin S² = (S1 + S2 + ... + SN)². Expanding this gives S² = sum_i Si² + 2 sum_{i<j} Si·Sj. Therefore, solving for the sum of Si·Sj gives [S² - sum_i Si²]/2. \n\nIn our case, since each ti is like a spin-1/2 operator, each ti² would be (1/2)^2 times the identity matrix, right? Because for spin-1/2, S² = (3/4) I. Wait, more precisely, for each individual ti, since they are 1/2 * Pauli matrices, their square would be (1/2)^2 * Pauli matrix squared. And since Pauli matrices squared are identity, so ti² = (1/2)^2 * I. Therefore, sum_i ti² = N*(1/2)^2 * I = N/4 * I.\n\nSo if we do the same for total T²:\n\nT² = [sum_i ti]^2 = sum_i ti² + 2 sum_{i<j} ti·tj\n\nTherefore, rearranging:\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T² - sum_i ti²]/2 = [T² - N/4]/2\n\nBut wait, the problem says the answer is 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3N/4]. Let me check my steps.\n\nWait, T² is the total isospin squared operator. For a given total isospin T, the eigenvalue of T² is T(T+1). However, here we are dealing with operators. But in the expression above, we have T² - sum ti². Let me write that again.\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T² - sum_i ti²]/2\n\nBut sum_i ti² is N*( (1/2)^2 * I ) = N*(1/4) I. Therefore,\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T² - N/4 I ] / 2\n\nBut the problem states that the sum is equal to 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3N/4]. Hmm. There is a discrepancy here. According to my calculation, it's [T² - N/4]/2. But the problem's answer has [T(T+1) - 3N/4]/2. So maybe there's a miscalculation here?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be careful with the definition of T². Let me think again. T² is the square of the total isospin operator. For each individual ti, since they are 1/2 * Pauli matrices, ti² = (1/2)^2 * I. Therefore, sum_i ti² is N*(1/4) I. Then T² is sum_i ti² + 2 sum_{i<j} ti·tj. Therefore:\n\nT² = sum_i ti² + 2 sum_{i<j} ti·tj\n\nHence, solving for sum_{i<j} ti·tj:\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T² - sum_i ti²]/2 = [T² - (N/4) I ] / 2\n\nBut the problem says that sum_{i>j} ti·tj = 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3N/4]. Let me check the difference between T² and T(T+1). For a system with total isospin T, T² has eigenvalue T(T+1). However, here we have operator T². So if we take the expectation value, it would be T(T+1). But in the expression above, we have T² - N/4. So if we write T² as T(T+1) when acting on a state with definite T, but here we are dealing with operators. However, the problem statement wants an operator expression. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that T² is expressed in terms of T(T+1) as an operator? Wait, no, T² is already the operator. Wait, perhaps I need to check dimensions?\n\nWait, let me check for a specific case. Let's take N=2. For two nucleons, each with isospin 1/2. The total isospin T can be 1 or 0. Let's compute sum_{i>j} ti·tj. For two particles, i>j is only one pair: t1·t2.\n\nWhat is t1·t2? Since ti are 1/2 Pauli matrices, t1·t2 = (1/2)(σ1·σ2 / 2)? Wait, no. Wait, ti is already 1/2 times Pauli matrices. So if Pauli matrices are σ, then ti = σ_i / 2. Therefore, t1·t2 = (σ1 · σ2)/4. And σ1·σ2 = 2 t1·t2 * 4? Wait, let me compute:\n\nIf ti = (1/2) σ_i, then ti·tj = (1/2)^2 σ_i · σ_j. For i ≠ j, σ_i · σ_j = σ_x σ_x + σ_y σ_y + σ_z σ_z. But actually, for two different particles, the dot product would be σ1·σ2 = σ1x σ2x + σ1y σ2y + σ1z σ2z. The expectation value of this is something, but as an operator, σ1·σ2 = 2 P_swap - I, where P_swap is the swap operator? Or maybe another identity. Alternatively, we know that for two spins, (σ1 + σ2)^2 = σ1² + σ2² + 2 σ1·σ2. Therefore, σ1·σ2 = [(σ1 + σ2)^2 - σ1² - σ2²]/2. Since σ1² = σ2² = 3 I? Wait, no. Wait, for each individual σ², for example, σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z² = 3 I. But σ1·σ2 is σ1x σ2x + σ1y σ2y + σ1z σ2z. \n\nBut for two particles, the total spin squared S² = (S1 + S2)^2. If S is 1/2, then ti = (1/2) σ_i. So total T = t1 + t2 = (σ1 + σ2)/2. Therefore, T² = [(σ1 + σ2)/2]^2 = [σ1² + σ2² + 2 σ1·σ2]/4. Since σ1² = σ2² = 3 I, then T² = [3I + 3I + 2 σ1·σ2]/4 = [6I + 2 σ1·σ2]/4 = [3I + σ1·σ2]/2. Therefore, solving for σ1·σ2: σ1·σ2 = 2 T² - 3I. \n\nBut ti·tj = (σ1·σ2)/4. Therefore, t1·t2 = [2 T² - 3I]/4. For N=2, sum_{i>j} ti·tj = t1·t2 = [2 T² - 3I]/4. \n\nNow, according to the formula we are supposed to prove, it should be 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3N/4]. For N=2, this would be 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3*2/4] = 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3/2]. \n\nBut let's compute T² for N=2. T can be 1 or 0. For T=1, T(T+1) = 1*2 = 2. Then the formula gives 1/2 [2 - 3/2] = 1/2 [1/2] = 1/4. \n\nOn the other hand, from our previous expression: [2 T² - 3I]/4. For T=1, T² = T(T+1) = 2, so [2*2 - 3I]/4 = [4 - 3]/4 = 1/4. Which matches. For T=0, T(T+1) = 0*1 = 0. The formula gives 1/2 [0 - 3/2] = -3/4. From our expression, T² = 0(0+1) = 0. Then [2*0 - 3I]/4 = -3/4. Which also matches. Therefore, the formula for N=2 is consistent with the given formula. \n\nBut according to our general derivation earlier, sum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T² - N/4]/2. For N=2, this would be [T² - 2/4]/2 = [T² - 1/2]/2. Let's compare with the correct expression [T(T+1) - 3N/4]/2. For N=2, that's [T(T+1) - 3/2]/2. \n\nBut T² is equal to T(T+1) for the eigenstates. However, in the operator expression, T² is the operator whose eigenvalues are T(T+1). So in the general case, if we have operator expressions, then T² is the operator, and when acting on a state with definite T, it gives T(T+1). However, in our previous derivation, we had sum ti·tj = [T² - N/4]/2. But in the N=2 case, that would be [T² - 1/2]/2. However, the correct expression is [T(T+1) - 3/2]/2. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here. So my initial derivation must be wrong.\n\nWait, why? Let me check again. For N=2, T² = [sum ti]^2 = t1² + t2² + 2 t1·t2. Therefore, sum ti·tj = [T² - sum ti²]/2. For N=2, sum ti² = t1² + t2². Each ti² is (1/2)^2*(σ_i²). Since σ_i² = 3I? Wait, no! Wait, σ is Pauli matrix. For a single Pauli matrix, σ_x² = σ_y² = σ_z² = I. Therefore, σ_i² = σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z²? No, wait, σ_i is a vector of matrices. Wait, confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nEach ti is a vector operator. For example, ti has components tx, ty, tz. Each component is (1/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix. Therefore, ti·ti = tx² + ty² + tz². Each tx² is [(1/2)σx]^2 = (1/4)σx² = (1/4)I, since σx² = I. Similarly for ty² and tz². Therefore, ti·ti = 3*(1/4)I = 3/4 I. Therefore, sum_i ti² = N*(3/4) I. Wait, this is different from my previous conclusion. Earlier I thought ti² was (1/2)^2 I, but that was incorrect. Because ti is a vector operator, and ti·ti is the sum of squares of each component. Each component squared is (1/2)^2 times σ², which is (1/4) I. Therefore, three components give 3*(1/4) I = 3/4 I. Therefore, sum_i ti² = N*(3/4) I. \n\nAh! So my mistake was in thinking that ti² was (1/2)^2 I, but actually ti·ti is 3*(1/2)^2 I = 3/4 I. Therefore, sum_i ti² = 3N/4 I. Therefore, going back to the expansion:\n\nT² = sum_i ti² + 2 sum_{i<j} ti·tj\n\nTherefore,\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T² - sum_i ti²]/2 = [T² - 3N/4 I]/2\n\nWhich is exactly the formula given in the problem: 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3N/4]. Wait, but here it's [T² - 3N/4]/2. However, the problem says 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3N/4]. So if T² is the total isospin operator squared, then when acting on a state with definite total isospin T, T² has eigenvalue T(T+1). Therefore, in operator terms, if we are expressing the sum in terms of T², then it's [T² - 3N/4]/2. However, if we want to write it in terms of the eigenvalue T(T+1), then for a specific state, it would be [T(T+1) - 3N/4]/2. But the problem says \"Prove that ∑... = 1/2 [T(T+1) - 3N/4]\". So perhaps they are considering that T² is replaced by its eigenvalue T(T+1)? But the question says \"where T is the total isospin quantum number of the system\". So maybe the problem is in the context of states with definite total isospin T, so that T² = T(T+1) in that case. Therefore, the operator expression ∑ ti·tj becomes [T(T+1) - 3N/4]/2. \n\nTherefore, the correct derivation is:\n\nStart with T² = (sum ti)^2 = sum ti² + 2 sum_{i<j} ti·tj\n\nEach ti² is (for each nucleon) ti·ti = 3/4 I, as shown above. Therefore, sum ti² = 3N/4 I. Therefore:\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T² - 3N/4 I]/2 \n\nBut if we are talking about the expectation value or in a state with definite T, then T² = T(T+1), so:\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T(T+1) - 3N/4]/2 \n\nWhich is exactly the formula we needed to prove. Therefore, the key mistake was in calculating ti·ti. Initially, I thought ti² was (1/2)^2 I, but actually ti·ti is the sum over the squares of each component, which gives 3*(1/2)^2 I = 3/4 I. \n\nSo the correct steps are:\n\n1. Recognize that T = sum_i ti.\n\n2. Compute T² = (sum ti)·(sum tj) = sum ti² + 2 sum_{i<j} ti·tj.\n\n3. Calculate ti² for each nucleon. Since ti is a vector operator with components (1/2 σx, 1/2 σy, 1/2 σz), then ti·ti = (1/2)^2 (σx² + σy² + σz²) = (1/4)(I + I + I) = 3/4 I.\n\n4. Therefore, sum_i ti² = N*(3/4) I.\n\n5. Substitute into the expression for T²:\n\nT² = (3N/4) I + 2 sum_{i<j} ti·tj.\n\n6. Solve for the sum:\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T² - (3N/4) I]/2.\n\n7. In the problem statement, they refer to T as the total isospin quantum number, so when acting on a state with definite T, T² = T(T+1) I. Therefore, substituting:\n\nsum_{i<j} ti·tj = [T(T+1) - 3N/4]/2.\n\nWhich is the desired result.\n\nTherefore, the key was correctly computing ti·ti for each nucleon. Initially, I confused ti² with just one component squared, but since ti is a vector operator, we need to take the dot product, which includes all three components. Each component squared contributes (1/2)^2 I, so three components give 3*(1/2)^2 I = 3/4 I. \n\nLet me check another example for N=1. If N=1, then the sum over i>j is zero. According to the formula, it should be [T(T+1) - 3*1/4]/2. For N=1, the total isospin T is 1/2. Therefore, T(T+1) = (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4. Then [3/4 - 3/4]/2 = 0/2 = 0. Which matches, since there are no pairs. Good.\n\nAnother check for N=3. Suppose we have three nucleons. The total isospin can be T=3/2 or T=1/2. Let me not get into specifics, but the formula should hold regardless. The derivation is general, so as long as the steps are correct, it should be valid. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the sum over ti·tj pairs is [T² - 3N/4]/2, and since T² for a state with total isospin T is T(T+1), the expression becomes [T(T+1) - 3N/4]/2. Therefore, the problem's required identity is proven.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[T(T+1)-\\frac{3}{4} N\\right]}\n</think>"}
