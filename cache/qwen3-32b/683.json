The camera has a 50 mm focal length lens and an f-number of 2. Hmm, let me start by recalling what resolving power means. I think it's related to the ability of an optical system to distinguish between two closely spaced objects. There's something called the Rayleigh criterion, right? Which states that two point sources are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. \n\nSo, the Rayleigh criterion formula is something like θ = 1.22 λ / D, where θ is the angular resolution, λ is the wavelength of light, and D is the diameter of the lens aperture. But wait, how do I find D? The problem gives me the focal length and the f-number. The f-number is defined as the focal length divided by the diameter of the aperture. So, f-number = f / D. Therefore, D = f / f-number. \n\nGiven that the focal length f is 50 mm and the f-number is 2, the aperture diameter D would be 50 mm / 2 = 25 mm. That's 0.025 meters. Okay, so D = 0.025 m. \n\nNow, I need to calculate the angular resolution θ. But I need the wavelength λ. The problem doesn't specify the wavelength, but car headlights typically emit light in the visible spectrum. Let me assume an average wavelength. Maybe around 550 nm, which is green light, since that's the peak sensitivity for the human eye. But car headlights are usually white, which is a mix of wavelengths. However, for estimation purposes, maybe 550 nm is okay. Let me note that λ = 550 nm = 550 x 10^-9 meters. \n\nSo plugging into the Rayleigh criterion: θ = 1.22 * λ / D. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, compute 1.22 * 550e-9 m / 0.025 m. Let me do the math. \n\n1.22 * 550 = approx 671. So 671 x 10^-9 / 0.025. \n\nWhich is 671e-9 / 0.025 = 671 / 0.025 * 1e-9. \n\n671 divided by 0.025 is 671 / 0.025. Since 1 / 0.025 is 40, so 671 * 40 = 26,840. So θ ≈ 26,840 x 1e-9 radians. \n\nWhich is 2.684 x 10^-5 radians. Let me check the calculation again to be sure. \n\nWait, 1.22 * 550 = 671? Let me calculate 1.22 * 500 = 610, and 1.22 * 50 = 61, so total 610 + 61 = 671. Yes, that's correct. \n\nThen 671e-9 divided by 0.025 m. 0.025 m is 2.5 cm. So 671e-9 / 0.025 ≈ 2.684e-5 radians. \n\nSo θ ≈ 2.684 x 10^-5 radians. \n\nNow, I need to compare this angular resolution to the angular separation of the two car headlights. If the angular separation is greater than θ, then they can be resolved; otherwise, they cannot. \n\nSo, what is the typical distance between two car headlights? Let me think. On a car, the distance between the two headlights is usually about... maybe 1.5 meters? I think it's roughly that. Let me check my memory. For example, if a car is about 1.8 meters wide, and the headlights are on the front corners, maybe they are spaced about 1.5 meters apart. Let me take that as an approximate value. Let me denote that as d = 1.5 m. \n\nThe distance from the satellite to the car is given as 100 km, which is 100,000 meters. Let's call that distance L = 100,000 m. \n\nThe angular separation α of the two headlights is approximately d / L, assuming small angles where tan(α) ≈ α in radians. \n\nSo α ≈ 1.5 m / 100,000 m = 1.5 / 1e5 = 1.5e-5 radians. \n\nComparing that to the angular resolution θ ≈ 2.684e-5 radians. \n\nSo since α (1.5e-5) is less than θ (2.684e-5), that means the angular separation is smaller than the resolving power. Therefore, the two headlights cannot be resolved. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my numbers. Maybe my assumption about the distance between headlights is wrong? If the headlights are farther apart, say 2 meters, then α would be 2 / 1e5 = 2e-5 radians, which is still less than θ. If they are 3 meters apart, then 3e-5 radians, which is still less than 2.68e-5? Wait, no. 3e-5 is 0.00003, while θ is ~0.0000268. So if the angular separation is larger than θ, then they can be resolved. So if α > θ, then yes. \n\nSo if the actual angular separation is less than θ, they can't be resolved. \n\nBut in my case, if the headlights are 1.5 m apart, then α is 1.5e-5, which is less than θ, so they can't be resolved. If they are 2.684e-5 radians apart, that would correspond to a separation d = α * L = 2.684e-5 * 1e5 = 2.684 meters. So if the headlights are more than ~2.68 meters apart, then they can be resolved. But if they are less than that, they can't. \n\nSince typical car headlight spacing is about 1.5 meters, then they can't be resolved. \n\nBut let me check again the calculation for θ. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. \n\nθ = 1.22 * λ / D. \n\nλ = 550 nm = 550e-9 m. \n\nD = 25 mm = 0.025 m. \n\nSo θ = 1.22 * 550e-9 / 0.025. \n\nLet me compute 550 / 0.025 first. 550 / 0.025 = 550 / (2.5e-2) = 550 / 2.5 * 1e2 = 220 * 100 = 22,000. \n\nThen multiply by 1.22: 22,000 * 1.22 = 26,840. \n\nThen multiply by 1e-9: 26,840e-9 radians = 2.684e-5 radians. Yes, same as before. \n\nSo θ ≈ 2.684e-5 radians. \n\nAngular separation α = d / L. Let's take d as 1.5 m, L = 1e5 m. \n\nα = 1.5 / 1e5 = 1.5e-5 radians. \n\nSo θ is bigger than α, meaning that the two headlights are not resolved. \n\nAlternatively, if I take a different wavelength? For example, if car headlights are more in the red or blue? Let me check. \n\nIf the wavelength is shorter, say 450 nm (blue), then θ would be smaller, so maybe they can be resolved? \n\nLet me try with λ = 450 nm. \n\nθ = 1.22 * 450e-9 / 0.025. \n\nCompute 1.22 * 450 = 549. Then 549e-9 / 0.025. \n\nSame as before, 549 / 0.025 = 21,960. Multiply by 1e-9: 2.196e-5 radians. \n\nSo θ ≈ 2.196e-5 radians. \n\nThen α is 1.5e-5, which is still less than θ. Wait, no. 1.5e-5 is 0.000015, θ is ~0.00002196. Wait, no, θ is larger than α. Wait, if θ is 2.196e-5, which is ~2.2e-5, and α is 1.5e-5, then θ is bigger, so still can't resolve. \n\nWait, but if θ is smaller, then α would be larger than θ? No, θ is the minimum angular separation that can be resolved. So if θ is smaller, that means the system can resolve smaller angles. \n\nWait, if θ is smaller, then since α is fixed (depends on the actual separation and distance), if θ is smaller than α, then you can resolve. \n\nBut in this case, θ is 2.196e-5 (for blue light) versus α = 1.5e-5. Wait, θ is bigger than α. Wait, no, θ is 2.196e-5, which is bigger than 1.5e-5. Therefore, even with blue light, the angular separation is still smaller than θ, so still can't resolve. \n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the comparison. Let me clarify. \n\nThe Rayleigh criterion says that two objects are resolvable if their angular separation is greater than θ. So if α > θ, resolvable; if α < θ, not resolvable. \n\nIn our case, α is 1.5e-5 radians. θ is about 2.68e-5 radians (for green) or 2.19e-5 (for blue). Either way, θ is bigger than α. Therefore, α < θ, so they cannot be resolved. \n\nBut if we take a longer wavelength, say red light, 700 nm. \n\nθ = 1.22 * 700e-9 / 0.025. \n\nCompute 1.22 * 700 = 854. \n\n854 / 0.025 = 34,160. Multiply by 1e-9: 3.416e-5 radians. \n\nSo θ is even bigger, so worse resolution. So even worse. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the wavelength (assuming visible light), θ is in the range of ~2.2e-5 to 3.4e-5 radians, and α is 1.5e-5, so α < θ, so not resolvable. \n\nBut wait, maybe my assumption about the headlight separation is wrong. Maybe the distance between headlights is more than 1.5 meters? Let me check. \n\nLooking up typical distances between car headlights... Well, I can't actually look it up, but let me think. For example, a car that's 1.8 meters wide. If the headlights are on the outer edges, then the distance between them would be roughly the width of the car. So maybe 1.5 to 2 meters? If it's 2 meters, then α would be 2 / 1e5 = 2e-5 radians. \n\nCompare to θ. For green light, θ was 2.68e-5. So if α is 2e-5, which is less than θ. Still can't resolve. \n\nIf the headlights are 3 meters apart, then α is 3e-5 radians. Then for green light θ is 2.68e-5. Then α > θ, so they can be resolved. \n\nBut are car headlights 3 meters apart? That seems quite wide. Maybe for some large vehicles? Maybe trucks? But for regular cars, probably not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming some standard value? Maybe I need to check standard headlight separation? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating θ? Let me check again. \n\nθ = 1.22 * λ / D. \n\nD is 0.025 m. \n\nλ is in meters. \n\nSo θ is 1.22 * 550e-9 / 0.025 ≈ 1.22 * 550 / 0.025 * 1e-9 ≈ 1.22 * 22000 * 1e-9 ≈ 2.684e-5 radians. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider something else? Like the pixel size of the camera? Wait, the problem didn't mention anything about the sensor or pixel size. It only gives the focal length and f-number. So probably the question is purely about the diffraction limit, not the pixelation. \n\nSo assuming that the camera is diffraction-limited, then the resolving power is given by the Rayleigh criterion. Therefore, if the angular separation is less than θ, then even a diffraction-limited system cannot resolve them. \n\nTherefore, given that the angular separation is 1.5e-5 radians and θ is ~2.68e-5 radians, the answer would be no, the lights cannot be resolved. \n\nBut let me think again: is the Rayleigh criterion the right approach here? Or is there another way to calculate the resolving power? \n\nAlternatively, the resolving power can also be calculated using the formula: \n\nResolution (in radians) ≈ 1.22 λ / D. \n\nYes, that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes in optics, the formula is presented as: \n\nThe minimum resolvable angle θ ≈ λ / D, neglecting the 1.22 factor. But the 1.22 is for circular apertures (which is the case here, since the lens is circular). For rectangular apertures or other shapes, it might be different. But for the Rayleigh criterion, it's 1.22 λ / D. \n\nSo I think my approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the f-number in a different way? Let me check. \n\nThe f-number is f / D = 2, so D = f / 2 = 50 mm / 2 = 25 mm, which is what I did. So that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute the size of the Airy disk on the sensor? Let me think. The angular resolution θ is related to the linear resolution on the sensor. But since the problem is about resolving two lights at a distance, maybe that's not necessary. \n\nBut let me try. The angular resolution θ is related to the linear resolution on the image sensor. The size of the Airy disk on the sensor would be θ multiplied by the focal length. \n\nBut perhaps that's complicating things. Since the question is about whether two lights can be resolved at 100 km, which is about the angular resolution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the formula for resolving power in terms of distance. \n\nThe resolving power (minimum distance between two objects that can be resolved) is given by: \n\nd_min = 1.22 λ L / D \n\nWhere L is the distance to the objects. \n\nLet me check. \n\nYes, since θ ≈ d_min / L ≈ 1.22 λ / D => d_min ≈ 1.22 λ L / D \n\nSo plugging numbers: \n\nd_min = 1.22 * 550e-9 m * 1e5 m / 0.025 m \n\nCompute numerator: 1.22 * 550e-9 * 1e5 = 1.22 * 550 * 1e-4 = 1.22 * 0.055 = 0.0671 meters. \n\nThen divide by D = 0.025 m? Wait, no, the formula is d_min = 1.22 * λ * L / D \n\nSo 1.22 * 550e-9 m * 1e5 m / 0.025 m \n\nLet me compute step by step: \n\nFirst, 550e-9 m * 1e5 m = 550e-9 * 1e5 = 550e-4 = 0.0055 m²? Wait, no, units? Wait, λ is in meters, L is in meters. Multiplying them gives m²? Then dividing by D (meters) gives meters. \n\nSo yes, units are okay. \n\nSo compute 1.22 * 550e-9 * 1e5 / 0.025 \n\nFirst compute 550e-9 * 1e5 = 550e-4 = 0.0055 \n\nThen multiply by 1.22: 0.0055 * 1.22 ≈ 0.00671 \n\nThen divide by 0.025: 0.00671 / 0.025 ≈ 0.2684 meters. \n\nSo d_min ≈ 0.2684 meters. \n\nSo the minimum distance between two objects that can be resolved at 100 km is approximately 0.268 meters, or 26.8 centimeters. \n\nBut the headlights are 1.5 meters apart, which is much larger than 0.268 meters. Wait, this contradicts my previous conclusion! \n\nWait, what? If d_min is 0.268 m, and the actual separation is 1.5 m, which is larger than d_min, then they can be resolved! \n\nBut earlier, when I calculated angular separation α = 1.5e-5 radians and θ = 2.68e-5 radians, I thought that α < θ, meaning not resolvable. But according to this formula, since d = 1.5 m > d_min = 0.268 m, they can be resolved. \n\nThere must be a miscalculation here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in the first approach, θ was 2.68e-5 radians, and α was 1.5e-5 radians. So θ is larger than α, meaning that the angular separation is smaller than the resolution limit. Therefore, not resolvable. \n\nBut according to the second approach, d_min = 0.268 m, and actual separation is 1.5 m, which is larger, so resolvable. \n\nThese two approaches should be consistent. Where is the mistake? \n\nLet me check the second approach. \n\nd_min = 1.22 * λ * L / D \n\nPlugging numbers: \n\nλ = 550e-9 m \n\nL = 1e5 m \n\nD = 0.025 m \n\nSo 1.22 * 550e-9 * 1e5 / 0.025 \n\nLet me compute 550e-9 * 1e5 first. \n\n550e-9 * 1e5 = 550 * 1e-9 * 1e5 = 550 * 1e-4 = 0.055 \n\nWait, previously I had 0.0055. Wait, which is correct? \n\nWait, 550e-9 is 5.5e-7. \n\nMultiply by 1e5: 5.5e-7 * 1e5 = 5.5e-2 = 0.055. Yes, I had previously miscalculated it as 0.0055. That was my mistake. \n\nSo correcting that: \n\nNumerator: 1.22 * 0.055 ≈ 1.22 * 0.055 ≈ 0.0671 \n\nThen divide by D = 0.025 m: \n\n0.0671 / 0.025 ≈ 2.684 meters. \n\nAh! So d_min ≈ 2.684 meters. Therefore, if the separation is larger than 2.68 meters, they can be resolved. Since the headlights are 1.5 meters apart, which is less than 2.68 meters, they cannot be resolved. \n\nTherefore, this is consistent with the first approach. \n\nEarlier, I had made a calculation mistake where I thought d_min was 0.268 m, but actually it is 2.68 m. \n\nTherefore, the two headlights with separation d = 1.5 m cannot be resolved, since d < d_min. \n\nTherefore, both approaches agree. \n\nSo my initial conclusion was correct, the mistake was in the intermediate calculation where I miscalculated 550e-9 * 1e5. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\nUsing θ = 1.22 λ / D ≈ 2.68e-5 radians. \n\nAngular separation α = d / L = 1.5 / 1e5 = 1.5e-5 radians. \n\nSince α < θ, cannot resolve. \n\nUsing d_min = 1.22 λ L / D ≈ 2.68 meters. Since actual d = 1.5 m < d_min, cannot resolve. \n\nTherefore, answer is no, they cannot be resolved. \n\nBut wait, let me check once more with corrected numbers. \n\nd_min = 1.22 * 550e-9 * 1e5 / 0.025 \n\n= 1.22 * 550e-9 * 1e5 / 0.025 \n\n= 1.22 * 550 / 0.025 * 1e-9 * 1e5 \n\n= 1.22 * 550 / 0.025 * 1e-4 \n\nCalculate 550 / 0.025 = 22,000 \n\nMultiply by 1.22: 22,000 * 1.22 = 26,840 \n\nMultiply by 1e-4: 26,840 * 1e-4 = 2.684 meters. \n\nYes, correct. \n\nSo the minimum separation that can be resolved is ~2.68 meters. \n\nTherefore, since car headlights are typically about 1.5 meters apart, they cannot be resolved. \n\nTherefore, the answer is no. \n\nBut let me check if there are other factors. For example, maybe the lights are not point sources? Or maybe the human eye can see them, but the camera can't? But the question is about the camera resolving them. \n\nAlso, perhaps the lights are bright enough that the diffraction isn't the limiting factor? But in reality, for such a long distance, diffraction would dominate. \n\nAnother thing: the wavelength. If the headlights are more in the blue, maybe the resolution is better. But even with blue light, as we saw earlier, the d_min was ~2.2 meters. Still higher than 1.5 meters. \n\nAlternatively, if the headlights are red, d_min is higher. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the color, they cannot be resolved. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is no, the two car headlights cannot be resolved at 100 km with the given camera parameters. \n\nBut let me think again if I made a mistake in the Rayleigh criterion. The Rayleigh criterion is for two point sources of the same wavelength. In reality, car headlights are extended sources, but for the purpose of resolution, treating them as point sources is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the formula for resolution in terms of f-number? Let me think. \n\nThe formula θ ≈ 1.22 λ / D, and since D = f / N (where N is f-number), then θ ≈ 1.22 λ N / f. \n\nYes, substituting D = f / N. \n\nSo θ ≈ 1.22 * λ * N / f \n\nPlugging numbers: \n\nλ = 550e-9 m \n\nN = 2 \n\nf = 50e-3 m \n\nθ ≈ 1.22 * 550e-9 * 2 / 50e-3 \n\nCalculate denominator: 50e-3 = 0.05 \n\nSo 1.22 * 550e-9 * 2 / 0.05 \n\nFirst compute 1.22 * 2 / 0.05 = 1.22 * 40 = 48.8 \n\nThen multiply by 550e-9: 48.8 * 550e-9 ≈ 48.8 * 5.5e-7 ≈ 268.4e-7 ≈ 2.684e-5 radians. Same result. \n\nSo same θ as before. \n\nTherefore, calculations are consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is no, the lights cannot be resolved. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{No}\n</think>"}
