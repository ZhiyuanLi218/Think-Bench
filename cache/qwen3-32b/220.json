I need to find the electric potential inside and outside a spherical shell with a surface charge density σ(θ) = 4 cosθ. Hmm, right. So the shell has radius R, and there are no charges inside or outside, just on the surface. The problem is to determine φ_in and φ_out. The options are given as A to D.\n\nFirst, I remember that for problems involving spherical symmetry and charge distributions, using Legendre polynomials or multipole expansions might be useful. Since the charge distribution is given as a function of θ, which is cosθ, that might correspond to a specific term in the Legendre polynomial expansion. Let me recall that the general solution for the potential outside and inside a spherical shell can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials if the charge distribution is axisymmetric, which it is here because σ depends only on θ.\n\nThe general form for the potential inside a sphere (r < R) is a series of terms involving r^l P_l(cosθ), and outside (r > R) it's a series involving 1/r^(l+1) P_l(cosθ). The coefficients for these terms are determined by matching the boundary conditions at the surface of the sphere, specifically the potential and the discontinuity in the electric field due to the surface charge.\n\nGiven σ(θ) = 4 cosθ, let's think about how this can be expressed in terms of Legendre polynomials. The Legendre polynomial P_1(cosθ) is just cosθ. So σ(θ) is proportional to P_1(cosθ). That suggests that only the l=1 term will be non-zero in the expansion. So maybe we can use that to find the potential.\n\nThe surface charge density σ is related to the discontinuity in the electric field across the shell. The electric field discontinuity is given by ΔE_r = σ / ε₀. Also, the potential inside and outside can be written as:\n\nInside: φ_in(r, θ) = Σ [A_l * r^l * P_l(cosθ)]\n\nOutside: φ_out(r, θ) = Σ [B_l / r^(l+1) * P_l(cosθ)]\n\nSince there's no charge inside or outside, the potential must satisfy Laplace's equation in those regions. Also, for the potential inside, as r approaches zero, it must remain finite. For l=1, r^l would be linear in r, which is okay. For higher l, same thing. But since our σ is only l=1, maybe only l=1 terms are present.\n\nSo let's focus on l=1. Let me write:\n\nφ_in(r, θ) = A_1 r cosθ\n\nφ_out(r, θ) = B_1 cosθ / r²\n\nBecause for l=1, outside, it's proportional to 1/r².\n\nNow, at r=R, the potential must be continuous. So:\n\nφ_in(R, θ) = φ_out(R, θ)\n\nWhich gives:\n\nA_1 R cosθ = B_1 cosθ / R²\n\nSo A_1 R = B_1 / R² => B_1 = A_1 R³.\n\nNext, the electric field discontinuity. The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential. Since we are dealing with spherical coordinates and axisymmetric case (no φ dependence), the radial component is -dφ/dr.\n\nInside, E_in(r) = -dφ_in/dr = -A_1 cosθ\n\nOutside, E_out(r) = -dφ_out/dr = -d/dr [B_1 cosθ / r²] = 2 B_1 cosθ / r³\n\nThe discontinuity in E_r at r=R is E_out(R) - E_in(R) = [2 B_1 cosθ / R³] - [ -A_1 cosθ ] = 2 B_1 cosθ / R³ + A_1 cosθ. But since inside the shell, there's no charge, the electric field inside should be zero? Wait, no. Wait, the potential inside is given by φ_in, which we have as A_1 r cosθ. But if there are no charges inside, then the electric field inside should satisfy Laplace's equation. However, unless A_1 is zero, there is an electric field. But why would there be an electric field inside if there's no charge?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the charge is on the shell. So inside the shell (r < R), there is no charge, so by Gauss's law, the electric field should be zero. Wait, but if the potential is A_1 r cosθ, then the electric field is -A_1 cosθ. For that to be zero everywhere inside, A_1 must be zero. But that contradicts unless... Wait, but Gauss's law says that the electric field inside a spherical shell with charge on the surface is zero. But here, the charge distribution is not uniform. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, Gauss's law in its integral form gives the total flux through a closed surface, but if the charge distribution is not spherically symmetric, then the electric field isn't necessarily uniform or zero. However, for a conducting shell with static charges, the charges arrange themselves to make the electric field inside zero, but here it's an insulating shell with a given charge distribution. So in this case, since the charge is on the surface and there's no charge inside, the electric field inside might not be zero. Wait, but Laplace's equation says that in a charge-free region, the potential satisfies Laplace's equation. So φ_in must satisfy ∇²φ_in = 0. Let's check if φ_in(r, θ) = A_1 r cosθ satisfies Laplace's equation inside the sphere.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, for axisymmetric case, Laplace's equation is:\n\n(1/r²) d/dr (r² dφ/dr) + (1/(r² sinθ)) d/dθ (sinθ dφ/dθ) ) = 0\n\nLet me compute that for φ_in = A_1 r cosθ.\n\nFirst term: d/dr (r² dφ/dr) = d/dr [ r² (-A_1 cosθ) ] = -A_1 cosθ * d/dr(r²) = -A_1 cosθ * 2r. Then multiplied by 1/r²: (-2 A_1 cosθ r)/r² = -2 A_1 cosθ / r.\n\nSecond term: (1/(r² sinθ)) d/dθ [ sinθ dφ/dθ ].\n\nCompute dφ/dθ = -A_1 r sinθ.\n\nThen sinθ * (-A_1 r sinθ) = -A_1 r sin²θ.\n\nThen derivative with respect to θ: d/dθ (-A_1 r sin²θ) = -A_1 r * 2 sinθ cosθ.\n\nMultiply by 1/(r² sinθ): [ -2 A_1 r sinθ cosθ ] / (r² sinθ ) = -2 A_1 cosθ / r.\n\nSo total Laplace equation: first term + second term is (-2 A_1 cosθ / r) + (-2 A_1 cosθ / r ) = -4 A_1 cosθ / r ≠ 0 unless A_1 = 0 or something else. Wait, that can't be. Wait, but if φ_in is supposed to satisfy Laplace's equation, then ∇²φ_in must be zero. But according to this calculation, it's -4 A_1 cosθ / r. Which is only zero if A_1 is zero. But that would mean the potential inside is zero. But that contradicts unless we made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the Laplace equation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, φ_in(r, θ) = A_1 r cosθ. Let me write that as A_1 r P_1(cosθ). For l=1, the general solution inside is A_1 r P_1(cosθ). The Laplace equation in spherical coordinates for this term should be satisfied. Wait, but why is my calculation giving non-zero?\n\nWait, maybe I did the derivatives wrong. Let me try again.\n\nLet me recall that for a potential of the form φ(r, θ) = (A r^l + B / r^{l+1}) P_l(cosθ), then ∇²φ = 0. So for l=1, inside, we take A r P_1(cosθ), and outside B / r² P_1(cosθ). Then Laplace's equation is satisfied. But why in my previous calculation I found non-zero?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the derivatives. Let me try again.\n\nCompute ∇²φ for φ(r, θ) = A r cosθ.\n\nFirst, compute radial derivatives:\n\ndφ/dr = A cosθ\n\nd/dr (r² dφ/dr) = d/dr (A r² cosθ) = 2 A r cosθ\n\nThen divide by r²: (2 A r cosθ)/r² = 2 A cosθ / r.\n\nNow angular derivatives:\n\nCompute dφ/dθ = -A r sinθ\n\nsinθ * dφ/dθ = -A r sin²θ\n\nd/dθ [ -A r sin²θ ] = -A r * 2 sinθ cosθ\n\nDivide by r² sinθ: (-2 A r sinθ cosθ) / (r² sinθ ) = -2 A cosθ / r.\n\nSo total ∇²φ = [2 A cosθ / r] + [ -2 A cosθ / r ] = 0. Oh! Wait, earlier I had a sign error. The first term was positive 2A cosθ / r, and the second term was negative 2A cosθ / r. So they cancel. Therefore, ∇²φ = 0. Okay, so my previous calculation was wrong because I had a sign error. So φ_in(r, θ) = A_1 r cosθ does satisfy Laplace's equation. Phew. So that's okay.\n\nSo back to the boundary conditions. At r=R, continuity of potential gives:\n\nA_1 R cosθ = B_1 cosθ / R² => B_1 = A_1 R³.\n\nThen, the electric field discontinuity. The electric field just outside the shell is E_out = -dφ_out/dr evaluated at r=R. Let's compute that:\n\nφ_out = B_1 cosθ / r²\n\ndφ_out/dr = -2 B_1 cosθ / r³\n\nSo E_out(r=R) = -dφ_out/dr = 2 B_1 cosθ / R³\n\nInside, E_in(r=R) = -dφ_in/dr = -A_1 cosθ\n\nThe discontinuity in E_r is E_out - E_in = [2 B_1 cosθ / R³] - [ -A_1 cosθ ] = 2 B_1 cosθ / R³ + A_1 cosθ\n\nBut this must equal σ / ε₀, which is 4 cosθ / ε₀.\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 B_1 / R³ + A_1 = 4 / ε₀\n\nBut since B_1 = A_1 R³, substitute:\n\n2 (A_1 R³) / R³ + A_1 = 2 A_1 + A_1 = 3 A_1 = 4 / ε₀ => A_1 = 4 / (3 ε₀)\n\nTherefore, A_1 is 4/(3 ε₀). Then B_1 = A_1 R³ = 4 R³ / (3 ε₀)\n\nTherefore, the potentials are:\n\nInside: φ_in(r, θ) = A_1 r cosθ = (4/(3 ε₀)) r cosθ\n\nOutside: φ_out(r, θ) = B_1 cosθ / r² = (4 R³ / (3 ε₀)) cosθ / r² = (4 R³ cosθ) / (3 ε₀ r²)\n\nLooking at the options, let's check the options:\n\nOption D says φ_in = (4r / 3ε₀) cosθ, φ_out = (4 R³ / 3ε₀ r²) cosθ. Which matches exactly what I found.\n\nBut let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B: φ_out = (4 R³ / 3ε₀ r²) cosθ, which matches. But φ_in is zero. But according to my calculation, φ_in is non-zero. However, earlier I thought that Gauss's law might imply that the field inside is zero. But no, Gauss's law in integral form would give the total flux, but for a non-uniform charge distribution, the electric field isn't necessarily zero. However, in the case of a conducting shell, charges rearrange to make the field inside zero, but here it's an insulating shell with a fixed charge distribution. So the field inside isn't zero. Therefore, the potential inside isn't zero. Hence, option D is correct, and option B is incorrect because it says φ_in is zero.\n\nOther options:\n\nOption C has φ_in with sinθ, but our solution is cosθ, so no.\n\nOption A has φ_in zero and φ_out with sinθ, which is also wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut let me cross-verify with another approach. Maybe using the method of multipole expansion.\n\nThe potential due to a surface charge distribution can be written using the formula involving the Legendre polynomials. For a surface charge σ(θ) on a sphere of radius R, the potential outside is given by:\n\nφ_out(r, θ) = Σ [ (R^{2l+1} / ε₀) ( (2l + 1)/ (4π)) ∫ σ(θ') P_l(cosθ') sinθ' dθ' ) / r^{l+1} ] P_l(cosθ)\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula. Alternatively, using the general expression for the potential outside a charged shell:\n\nφ_out(r, θ) = Σ [ (B_l / r^{l+1}) P_l(cosθ) ]\n\nWhere B_l = ( (2l + 1) ε₀ )^{-1} ∫ σ(θ') R^l P_l(cosθ') dΩ'\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the coefficients can be found by expanding σ(θ) in terms of Legendre polynomials. Since σ(θ) = 4 cosθ = 4 P_1(cosθ), then only l=1 term is present.\n\nFor the potential outside, the coefficient B_1 is related to the integral of σ(θ) P_1(cosθ) over the sphere. Let me recall the formula for the potential outside a spherical shell:\n\nφ_out(r, θ) = Σ [ (1 / (4π ε₀)) ( (R^{l+1} / r^{l+1}) ) ∫ σ(θ') P_l(cosθ') dΩ' ) P_l(cosθ) ]\n\nBut maybe I need to derive it. Alternatively, using the boundary condition at r=R.\n\nBut since we already did the method with matching boundary conditions and found D as the answer, which seems consistent, I think D is correct. Also, the inside potential is linear in r, which makes sense for a dipole-like field inside. Since the charge distribution is a dipole (cosθ), the potential inside would be linear in r, and outside would fall off as 1/r², which is dipole behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
