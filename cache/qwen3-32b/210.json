The question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms total. So, the aromatic ring is 6 carbons, and there are two substituents. Since there are 8 carbon atoms in total, the two substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, 6 in the ring plus two substituents. If the ring is 6 carbons, then two substituents would mean two more carbons? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the total number of carbon atoms is 8. So the aromatic ring is 6 carbons, and there are two substituents. Let's do the math: 6 (ring) + x + y = 8. So x + y = 2. So the two substituents must be single carbon groups? Like methyl or something? But maybe one of them is a two-carbon group? Wait, but if the total is 8, then if one substituent is two carbons, the other would be zero? That can't be. So probably each substituent is one carbon. But substituents can be more than one carbon. Let me think again. Wait, the compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. The ring is 6-carbon. So the two substituents together contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? Like two methyl groups? Or maybe one substituent is a two-carbon group and the other is zero? But that's not possible. So each substituent is one carbon. So maybe two methyl groups? Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen? Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has a carbonyl group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nSo the aromatic ring is substituted with two groups: one is a carbonyl (like a ketone or an acid derivative) and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). But how many carbon atoms do these substituents contribute? A carbonyl group is a C=O, so if it's a ketone, that would be a carbonyl attached to the ring. So that would add one carbon (the carbonyl carbon) to the ring. The halogen is just a substituent, which doesn't add a carbon. So if the ring is 6-carbon, and there's a carbonyl (adding one carbon) and a halogen (no carbon), then total carbons would be 6 + 1 + 0 = 7. But the total is supposed to be 8. So maybe the carbonyl is part of an ester or acid chloride, which would have an oxygen and maybe a methyl group? Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl (like in a ketone) and a methyl group? Let's see. If the ring is 6-carbon, a ketone substituent (like a methyl ketone) would be a carbonyl attached to a methyl group. So that would add two carbons (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon). Then the halogen is another substituent. Wait, but that would make 6 (ring) + 2 (from the ketone and methyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8. So that works. So the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring with a ketone group (like acetophenone) and a halogen (like chloro). But acetophenone has a methyl group and a carbonyl group. So if there's also a halogen, then the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 2 (from the methyl and carbonyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8. That fits.\n\nSo the structure would be something like a chloroacetophenone. Let's check the substituents: the ring is 6 carbons, the acetophenone part adds a carbonyl and a methyl (2 carbons), and the halogen is another substituent. Wait, but if there are two substituents, then the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 2 (from the carbonyl and methyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8. So that works. So the compound is chloroacetophenone or something similar.\n\nNow, looking at the 1H NMR options. Let's analyze each option.\n\nOption A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n\nThe 9.9 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton (but aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm). However, if it's a ketone, there's no aldehyde proton. Wait, but maybe it's a carboxylic acid? But carboxylic acids have broad peaks around 10-12 ppm. But the question says FTIR shows a carbonyl, not necessarily a carboxylic acid. If the 9.9 ppm is a singlet, maybe it's an aldehyde, but the structure we're considering is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrazone or something else? Wait, maybe the 9.9 ppm is an enol proton? Not sure. Let's hold on.\n\nOption B: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)\n\nThis has two aromatic doublets and a methyl singlet. If the structure is acetophenone (which has a methyl group and a ketone), the aromatic protons would be around 7.5-8 ppm as doublets (depending on substitution pattern), and the methyl would be around 2.5 ppm. But here the methyl is at 2.3 ppm, which is a bit low. Also, there's no peak for the carbonyl in the NMR. Wait, the carbonyl doesn't show up in 1H NMR. The problem is that the options don't mention the carbonyl, but the FTIR does. So the NMR data should be consistent with the structure.\n\nOption C: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)\n\nThis has a singlet at 6.9 (maybe an aromatic proton?), then two doublets around 4.8 and 4.6 (could be protons adjacent to oxygen or something), and a 1.3 ppm singlet. This seems more like an ether or something with methylene groups. But the aromatic protons are at 6.9, which is lower than usual for aromatic protons (usually 6.5-8.5). Also, the 4.8 and 4.6 ppm could be protons adjacent to oxygen, but in a di-substituted aromatic ring? Not sure.\n\nOption D: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)\n\nThis has two doublets around 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, and a methyl singlet at 1.3. This could be something like a compound with two methylene groups adjacent to oxygen (like two -O-CH2- groups) and a methyl. But again, not sure how that fits with a di-substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl and a halogen.\n\nBack to the structure. If the compound is chloroacetophenone (chloro group and a ketone with a methyl group), the aromatic protons would depend on the substitution pattern. Let's assume para or meta substitution. For example, if the ring has a methyl group (from acetophenone) and a chlorine. Let's say the acetophenone is para to the chlorine. Then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets (for ortho and meta protons), but the exact pattern depends on the substitution.\n\nBut the NMR data options don't have all the aromatic protons. Let's look again. The ring is 6-membered, so if it's di-substituted, there are four aromatic protons. Depending on the substitution pattern (para or meta), they would split into different patterns. For example, in para-substitution (like para-chloroacetophenone), the aromatic protons would be two doublets (each set of two protons), leading to two doublets. In meta-substitution, there might be more complex splitting.\n\nLooking at Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The 7.8 and 7.6 ppm doublets could correspond to two sets of aromatic protons. The 9.9 ppm singlet is unusual unless it's an aldehyde. But if the compound is a ketone, like acetophenone, there's no aldehyde proton. However, if it's an aldehyde with a halogen, like chlorobenzaldehyde, then the aldehyde proton would be around 9.8-10 ppm. But chlorobenzaldehyde has a total of 7 carbons (6 in ring + 1 aldehyde + 1 chlorine? Wait, no. The aldehyde is CHO, so that's one carbon. So total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (aldehyde) + 0 (chlorine) = 7. But the question says 8 carbons. So maybe it's a methyl ketone with a halogen. For example, chloroacetophenone: ring (6 C), acetophenone (2 C: one from the carbonyl and one from the methyl), and chlorine. Total is 6 + 2 = 8. That fits.\n\nIn acetophenone, the methyl group is at around 2.5 ppm as a singlet (since it's adjacent to a carbonyl). However, in Option A, the methyl is at 3.7 ppm. That seems higher than usual for a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl. Usually, methyl ketones have the methyl at around 2.2-2.5 ppm. So 3.7 ppm is more like a methoxy group (OCH3) which is around 3.7-4.0 ppm. But we have a carbonyl, not an ether. Hmm. Maybe if the methyl is adjacent to an oxygen? Like in an ester? Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen. If it's an ester, the carbonyl would be from the ester, and maybe the substituents are a methyl and a halogen. Let's consider that.\n\nIf the compound is a chloro ester, like methyl 4-chlorobenzoate. The structure would be a benzene ring with a COOCH3 group and a Cl group. Let's count the carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (COOCH3: one from the carbonyl and one from the methyl) + 0 (Cl) = 8. Yes. So that fits. The 1H NMR of methyl 4-chlorobenzoate would have aromatic protons, the methyl ester protons, and the methyl group from the ester. The aromatic protons would be around 7.5-8 ppm. The methyl ester protons (OCH3) would be around 3.7-4.0 ppm. The aliphatic protons from the ester (the CH2? No, it's a methyl ester: COOCH3, so the methyl is directly attached to the oxygen. So the OCH3 would be a singlet around 3.7 ppm. If the ring is para-substituted with Cl and the ester, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets (since para substitution would split into two sets of protons). So for example, two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. Then the OCH3 would be a singlet at 3.7 ppm. Also, there's the ester carbonyl, but that doesn't show up in 1H NMR. Additionally, the FTIR would show a carbonyl peak and an aromatic-halogen (C-Cl) peak. So this fits with Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). Wait, but where does the 9.9 ppm singlet come from? In methyl 4-chlorobenzoate, there's no aldehyde proton. The ester doesn't have a proton on the carbonyl. So that's confusing. Unless the 9.9 ppm is something else. Maybe it's a mistake? Or maybe the 9.9 ppm is not a proton signal? Wait, no, the options are 1H NMR data. So maybe the 9.9 ppm is an error. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a nitrile? No, the FTIR indicates a carbonyl, not a nitrile. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the 9.9 ppm is a proton from a different group. If the compound is a chloro ester with a hydroxyl group? But the FTIR would show an -OH peak. The question doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrazide or something else. This is getting complicated. Let's consider another possibility.\n\nIf the compound is a ketone with a halogen, like chloroacetophenone. The structure is a benzene ring with a COCH3 and a Cl. The 1H NMR would have aromatic protons (depending on substitution), a methyl group adjacent to the carbonyl (around 2.5 ppm), and no other aliphatic protons. If the aromatic protons are split into two doublets (para substitution), then the NMR would be something like: aromatic protons at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm (each 2H, doublets), methyl at 2.3 ppm (singlet). That matches Option B: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). But Option B doesn't have the 9.9 ppm singlet. However, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group, which is present in both ketone and ester. So why is there a 9.9 ppm in Option A? Maybe the 9.9 ppm is an error in the option, or maybe it's a different compound. Alternatively, maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. Let's check the carbon count again. If it's an aldehyde (CHO) and a halogen, then the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (aldehyde) + 0 (halogen) = 7. But the question says 8 carbons. So that doesn't fit. Unless there's another carbon in the substituent. For example, if the compound is an aldehyde with a methyl group and a halogen. But that would add more carbons. Let's see: 6 (ring) + 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (methyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8. So maybe a methyl group, a halogen, and an aldehyde. But that would be three substituents. The question says di-substituted. So that's not possible. So the 9.9 ppm must be something else. Maybe it's a proton from a different group, like a hydroxyl or amino, but the FTIR doesn't indicate that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with a methoxy group and a halogen. For example, a methyl ketone with a methoxy and a halogen. But that would add two more carbons (from the methyl and methoxy), making total 6 + 2 = 8. So that works. The 1H NMR would have aromatic protons, a methyl ketone (around 2.5 ppm), and a methoxy group (around 3.7 ppm). If the aromatic protons are split into two doublets (para substitution), then the NMR would be similar to Option A but with the 9.9 ppm replaced by the methyl ketone. However, Option A has a 9.9 ppm singlet. Unless that's a mistake. Maybe the 9.9 ppm is supposed to be the methyl ketone? But 2.5 ppm is more typical for a methyl ketone. So 9.9 is too high. This is confusing.\n\nLet's go back. The key points are: di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (so two substituents), 8 carbons total (so substituents add up to 2 carbons), FTIR shows carbonyl and aromatic-halogen bond. The correct NMR should have signals consistent with these.\n\nOption B: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). This could be a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. The aromatic protons are two doublets (each 2H), and a methyl singlet at 2.3 ppm. This fits with a ketone (methyl group) and a halogen. For example, para-chloroacetophenone. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets because of the para substitution. The methyl group is at 2.3 ppm (singlet), which is typical for a methyl ketone. The FTIR would show a carbonyl peak and a C-Cl bond. This matches the given information. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (methyl and carbonyl) = 8. So this seems correct.\n\nOption A has a 9.9 ppm singlet, which doesn't fit with a ketone. It might be an aldehyde, but that would require only 7 carbons. So Option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C and D have lower ppm values for aromatic protons and more aliphatic protons, which don't fit with the presence of a carbonyl and a halogen. So the correct answer is likely Option B.\n</think>"}
