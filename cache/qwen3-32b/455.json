The reaction involves a **nucleophilic base** that replaces the azido group **on the β-carbon**.

This is **not specific evidence** of the proposed mechanism.\n- **Conclusion**: **Not strong evidence**.\n\n#### **Option B: Difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**\n- **Analysis**: A **change in optical rotation** implies a **change in stereochemistry**. In the proposed mechanism, the Michael addition introduces a new chiral center at the β-carbon (or modifies an existing one). The resulting compound would have a **different configuration**, leading to a **different optical rotation** compared to the starting dipeptide. This is a **direct consequence** of the proposed mechanism.\n- **Conclusion**: **Strong evidence** for the mechanism.\n\n#### **Option C: Two new LCMS peaks appear during the course of the reaction, both of which have the same mass spectrum**\n- **Analysis**: If two new peaks appear with the **same mass**, it suggests the formation of **isomers** (e.g., stereoisomers or regioisomers). This could support a **stereoselective Michael addition**, which is part of the mechanism. However, the **same mass** implies that the **molecular weight** of both products is the same, which would only happen if the nucleophile and the leaving group (azide) are of **equal mass**—a rare scenario.

The question is about a peptide chemistry reaction where the dipeptide Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe is treated with a nucleophilic base, and the azido group gets replaced. The user is asking which evidence best supports the proposed β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism. The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a β-elimination and Michael addition reaction involves. β-elimination typically involves the removal of a β-hydrogen and a leaving group, forming a double bond. Then, a Michael addition is a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, combining these two steps, the mechanism would involve first eliminating the azide (which is a good leaving group) and forming a double bond, then the nucleophilic base adding to that double bond.\n\nThe key here is to determine what kind of evidence would confirm that both steps happened. The question is about the strongest evidence. Let's go through each option.\n\nOption A: Solubility changes. Solubility can change for various reasons, maybe due to different functional groups or ionization. But solubility changes aren't specific to the mechanism. It's more about physical properties, which might not directly indicate a specific reaction pathway. So probably not the best evidence.\n\nOption B: Difference in optical rotation. The starting dipeptide and product might have different configurations if a chiral center was involved. However, in the given dipeptide, the azido group is on the β-carbon of the alanine. If a β-elimination occurs, the β-carbon is where the azide is. If the elimination forms a double bond, maybe the stereochemistry changes. But the question is about a nucleophilic base adding to the β-carbon. Wait, the problem states that the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon. Wait, if the azide is replaced by the nucleophile on the β-carbon, that would change the substituent there. However, the original amino acid is 3-azido-L-alanine. The β-carbon here is the third carbon in the side chain? Wait, for alanine, the side chain is a methyl group. But 3-azido-L-alanine would have the azide on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I need to visualize the structure.\n\nWait, in alanine, the side chain is a CH3 group attached to the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). The β-carbon would be the next carbon in the side chain. But for alanine, the side chain is just a methyl group, so there's no β-carbon in the side chain. Wait, maybe the question is referring to the β-carbon of the amino acid in the peptide backbone? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn amino acids, the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino group, carboxyl group, and the side chain. The β-carbon would be the next one along the side chain. For example, in valine, the side chain is isopropyl, so the β-carbon would be the central carbon in the isopropyl group. But for alanine, the side chain is a methyl group, so there's no β-carbon in the side chain. Wait, maybe the question is using \"β-carbon\" in a different way. Maybe it's referring to the carbon adjacent to the α-carbon in the backbone? Wait, the backbone is: the amino group is on the α-carbon, the carboxyl group is on the same α-carbon. The next carbon in the backbone would be the γ-carbon, but maybe in this case, the azide is on the β-carbon of the amino acid. Wait, perhaps the 3-azido in the name refers to the position on the side chain. For example, if the amino acid is based on alanine but with an azide on the third carbon of the side chain. But alanine's side chain is only one carbon (methyl), so maybe it's a modified amino acid where the side chain is longer. Maybe it's like a three-carbon side chain with the azide on the third carbon. So the β-carbon would be the second carbon in the side chain, and the third is where the azide is. But when the question says the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon, that suggests that after elimination, a double bond forms between β and γ carbons, then the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the azide is on the β-carbon of the amino acid. For example, in the case of a modified amino acid where the side chain is longer. Let me think: the standard alanine has a methyl group as a side chain. If it's 3-azido-L-alanine, perhaps the side chain is three carbons long, with the azide on the third carbon. So the structure would be: the α-carbon (attached to the amino and carboxyl groups) has a side chain that's a three-carbon chain, with the azide on the third carbon. So the β-carbon would be the second carbon in that side chain. If a β-elimination occurs, the azide would leave from the third carbon (γ?), and a double bond forms between the β and γ carbons. Then a Michael addition could happen where the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of that conjugated system.\n\nBut the key here is that the mechanism involves a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. The question is about what evidence supports this mechanism.\n\nOption D: Absence of azide absorption in IR. The azide group has a characteristic IR absorption, so if it's replaced, that band would disappear. However, this is just evidence that the azide is gone, not necessarily about the mechanism. The mechanism could involve other reactions that remove the azide. So while D shows the azide is removed, it doesn't confirm the specific mechanism of β-elimination followed by Michael addition.\n\nOption C: Two new LCMS peaks with the same mass spectrum. If two new peaks appear with the same mass spectrum, that might suggest that the reaction is forming two different products with the same molecular weight. But why would that be evidence for the proposed mechanism? If the mechanism is a two-step process, maybe intermediates are formed. But if two peaks have the same mass spectrum, maybe they are stereoisomers or different regioisomers but same molecular weight. However, this is a bit vague. It could be due to different products, but it's not directly linking to the mechanism.\n\nOption B: Change in optical rotation. If the reaction involves a change in configuration at a chiral center, that would affect optical rotation. The starting material is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. If the azide is on the β-carbon of the alanine, and the reaction involves a β-elimination, which would create a double bond. Then, the Michael addition would add the nucleophile to the β-carbon. If the Michael addition is stereoselective, it could create a new chiral center or change the configuration of an existing one. However, the original alanine is L, so if the addition creates a new chiral center, the product might have a different configuration. But the problem states that the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon. If the β-carbon was previously part of a chiral center, changing the substituent there could alter the optical rotation. However, if the β-carbon wasn't chiral before, maybe it becomes chiral after the addition. But I'm not sure if the starting material's optical rotation would differ from the product's in a way that directly indicates the mechanism. It could be a possibility, but maybe not the strongest.\n\nOption D is about the absence of azide, which is a product change but not mechanism-specific. Option C suggests two products with same mass, maybe intermediates. Option B suggests a configuration change. Option A is about solubility, which is not specific.\n\nThe question is about the β-elimination–Michael addition. The key evidence would be something that shows both steps happened. For example, if the elimination creates a double bond (which can be detected by IR, maybe a new C=C stretch), and then the Michael addition adds the nucleophile. However, the options don't mention IR for C=C. But the question is about what is given in the options.\n\nOption C says two new LCMS peaks with same mass spectrum. If the mechanism involves a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, perhaps the reaction goes through an intermediate (like an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl) and then the nucleophile adds. If the intermediate is short-lived and not detected, but two products are formed from the Michael addition (maybe due to different stereochemistry or different attack directions), then two peaks with same mass but different retention times (hence different LCMS peaks) would appear. However, if their mass spectra are the same, that suggests same molecular weight. But the question states that the nucleophile replaces the azide. Wait, if the azide is replaced by the nucleophile, the molecular weight should change. Wait, unless the nucleophile has the same mass as the azide. But that's unlikely. Wait, the nucleophile is a base, maybe like a hydroxide or amine. The azide is N3. So unless the nucleophile is something that when added and the azide is removed, the molecular weight stays the same. For example, if the elimination and addition don't change the overall mass. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are the intermediate and the product. But the question says two new peaks appear during the reaction. If the reaction has an intermediate, you might see a peak for it. But the question says both have the same mass spectrum. Maybe they are tautomers or stereoisomers. If the mechanism involves a conjugate addition (Michael addition), you might get different regioisomers or stereoisomers. For example, if the nucleophile adds from different sides, leading to different configurations but same molecular weight. In that case, the two peaks would have same mass but different optical rotations (which is option B). But if they have same mass spectrum, that's option C. So option C could be evidence of two products formed via the proposed mechanism, which would support the mechanism. Whereas if only one product was formed, maybe it's a different mechanism. However, the question is about the strongest evidence. \n\nAlternatively, the absence of azide (option D) is just showing that azide is gone, but not about the mechanism. The question is asking for evidence that the specific mechanism (β-elimination followed by Michael addition) occurred. The presence of two peaks with same mass spectrum might indicate that the reaction went through a conjugated system (unsaturated carbonyl) allowing for Michael addition, leading to different addition products. Therefore, option C could be the answer. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in a β-elimination-Michael addition, the first step is elimination forming a double bond, then the Michael addition. If the reaction is monitored by LCMS and two new peaks appear, one might be the intermediate (the α,β-unsaturated dipeptide) and the other the final product after Michael addition. However, the question says \"both of which have the same mass spectrum.\" If they have the same mass spectrum, that would imply they have the same molecular weight. But if the first step is elimination (losing azide) and then Michael addition (adding nucleophile), the molecular weight would change. Unless the nucleophile adds and the azide is lost in such a way that the overall mass remains the same. For example, if the leaving group is azide (mass ~42) and the nucleophile is something like OH (mass ~17) plus some other groups, but that doesn't add up. Wait, unless it's a substitution where the azide is replaced by the nucleophile. Wait, the problem states that the azide is replaced by the nucleophile. So the molecular weight of the product would be the original dipeptide minus azide (mass) plus the nucleophile's mass. Unless the nucleophile is a base that deprotonates and then adds, but that's part of the mechanism. However, if the two peaks have the same mass spectrum, that suggests the same molecular weight. So maybe the reaction is a [2+2] type or some other process where the mass stays the same. This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two peaks are the starting material and the product. But the question says \"new peaks appear during the reaction,\" so they must be products. If the mechanism involves a reversible step or multiple pathways, but the mass is the same. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: if the β-elimination forms a double bond, and the Michael addition adds the nucleophile, then the overall reaction would involve the loss of azide and the addition of the nucleophile. Therefore, the molecular weight should change. Unless the nucleophile is H- or something. But the problem states that the nucleophile is a base, which could be, for example, an amine or hydroxide. So the molecular weight would change. Therefore, if two peaks have the same mass spectrum, that would not fit unless there's some other reason. Therefore, option C might not be correct.\n\nBack to option D: absence of azide in IR. This is a straightforward observation that the azide is gone. But the question is about the mechanism. The absence of azide just shows that the azide was replaced, but not the specific mechanism. However, the question states that the mechanism is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. If the elimination forms a double bond (which would have a C=C stretch in IR), then the presence of a new C=C band would support the mechanism. But the options don't mention that. Option D is about the absence of azide, which is expected if the azide was replaced. So maybe D is not the best evidence for the mechanism.\n\nOption B: difference in optical rotation. If the reaction involves a change in the configuration at a chiral center, this would be reflected in the optical rotation. For example, if the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon in a way that changes the configuration, leading to a different optical rotation. However, the original amino acid is L-alanine, which has a specific configuration. If the addition creates a new chiral center or modifies an existing one, the optical rotation would change. But the question is about the mechanism involving β-elimination and Michael addition. If the Michael addition is stereoselective, then the product would have a different configuration than the starting material. Therefore, a change in optical rotation would indicate that a stereospecific reaction occurred, which is part of the mechanism. So option B could be evidence that the reaction proceeded through a specific pathway that involves stereochemical changes, supporting the proposed mechanism.\n\nBut wait, the starting material is a dipeptide with Boc and OMe protecting groups. The azide is on the β-carbon of the alanine. If the β-elimination creates a double bond, then the Michael addition would add the nucleophile to the β-carbon. If the β-carbon was previously not a chiral center (since the azide is on the third carbon of the side chain, maybe the β-carbon is a CH2 group), then forming a double bond and adding a nucleophile could create a new chiral center. For example, if the β-carbon becomes a CH(R) group after addition. This would result in a new chiral center, changing the optical rotation. Therefore, a difference in optical rotation between the starting material and product would indicate that a new chiral center was formed or that an existing one changed configuration, which would be consistent with the proposed mechanism. Thus, option B would be strong evidence.\n\nAlternatively, if the mechanism didn't involve a stereospecific step, the optical rotation might not change. So if the optical rotation does change, it supports that the mechanism involves a step that affects the stereochemistry, like the Michael addition being stereoselective.\n\nComparing this with option C: if two peaks with same mass appear, but the question is about the mechanism. If the mechanism involves a reversible step or multiple products, but the question is about the mechanism being β-elimination followed by Michael addition. The presence of two peaks might indicate that the Michael addition is stereoselective, giving two diastereomers. If they have the same mass but different optical rotations, then both B and C could be relevant. However, the question asks for the strongest evidence. If the optical rotation changes (option B), that's a direct indication of a change in stereochemistry, which would be a key part of the mechanism (Michael addition's stereochemistry). Therefore, option B would be the strongest evidence.\n\nBut wait, the starting dipeptide has a specific configuration. If the product has a different configuration due to the addition, then B is correct. However, if the product is a new chiral center, the starting material might not have that chiral center. For example, if the β-carbon wasn't chiral before but becomes chiral after the addition, then the product would have a new chiral center, and the optical rotation would be different. However, the starting material's optical rotation is from the Phe and Ala residues. If the product has a new chiral center, the overall optical rotation could change. Therefore, option B would indicate that a new chiral center was formed or that an existing one changed, which is part of the mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, if the mechanism didn't involve such stereochemistry, maybe the optical rotation wouldn't change. Therefore, the change in optical rotation would support the proposed mechanism involving a stereospecific Michael addition.\n\nSo between B and C. The question is about the mechanism being β-elimination followed by Michael addition. The strongest evidence would be something that directly relates to the steps of the mechanism. The absence of azide (D) is a product change, not mechanism. Two peaks with same mass (C) could indicate two products from the Michael addition, but if they have same mass, it's not clear unless they are stereoisomers. However, if the optical rotation changes (B), that's a direct result of the stereochemistry change in the Michael addition step, which is part of the proposed mechanism. Therefore, B is stronger evidence.\n\nBut wait, another angle: in a β-elimination-Michael addition, the first step is elimination (losing azide) and forming a double bond, then the Michael addition. The presence of two LCMS peaks (C) could indicate the intermediate (unsaturated dipeptide) and the final product. However, the question states that the nucleophile replaces the azide. If the intermediate is the unsaturated compound, and the final product is the Michael adduct, then their masses would be different. The intermediate would have lost the azide (mass decrease), and the final product would have the nucleophile added. Therefore, their masses would be different. Hence, option C (same mass spectrum) wouldn't make sense. Therefore, option C is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the strongest evidence is B: difference in optical rotation, indicating a change in stereochemistry due to the Michael addition step.\n</think>"}
