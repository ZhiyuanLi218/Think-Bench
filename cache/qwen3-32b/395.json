The options are A through D. I remember that lenses and mirrors can form different types of images depending on their shape and how light interacts with them. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of concave and convex lenses and mirrors. Concave and convex refer to the curvature of the optical elements. For lenses, a concave lens is thinner in the middle and thicker at the edges, which causes light rays to diverge. A convex lens is thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges, causing light rays to converge. Mirrors work a bit differently: concave mirrors curve inward like a cave, and convex mirrors bulge outward.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Images produced by concave lenses are always real.\" Hmm, I think concave lenses are diverging lenses. When you pass light through a concave lens, the rays spread out. Real images are formed when light rays actually converge at a point. But since concave lenses diverge the light, they can't form real images. Instead, they always form virtual images, right? So statement A is false. So A is not the correct answer.\n\nOption B: \"Images produced by concave mirrors are always real.\" Concave mirrors can form both real and virtual images depending on the object's position relative to the focal point. If the object is outside the focal length, the mirror forms a real image. If the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual. For example, when you use a concave mirror as a makeup mirror, you're close to it (inside the focal length), and the image is virtual and enlarged. So B is false because they aren't always real. So B is not correct.\n\nOption C: \"Images produced by convex lenses can be both real and virtual.\" Convex lenses are converging lenses. Depending on where the object is placed, they can form real or virtual images. If the object is beyond the focal length, the image is real and inverted. If the object is within the focal length, the image is virtual, upright, and magnified. So yes, convex lenses can produce both. So C seems true. Let me check if that's correct. For example, in a magnifying glass, which is a convex lens, when you hold it close to an object (within the focal length), you get a virtual image. But if you use it to focus sunlight to start a fire, the image is real (the focused point of light). So C is correct.\n\nOption D: \"Images produced by convex mirrors can be both real and virtual.\" Convex mirrors are diverging mirrors. They always produce virtual images, regardless of where the object is placed. Because the mirror curves outward, any light reflecting off it diverges, so the image can't be formed on a screen (virtual). For example, car side mirrors are convex and always show virtual images. So D is false because convex mirrors can't form real images. So D is not correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct answer should be C. Let me just double-check each statement to be sure.\n\nA: Concave lenses always real? No, they always virtual. Correct.\nB: Concave mirrors always real? No, can be real or virtual. Correct.\nC: Convex lenses can be both. Yes, correct.\nD: Convex mirrors can be both? No, always virtual. Correct.\n\nYes, so the answer is C.\n</think>"}
