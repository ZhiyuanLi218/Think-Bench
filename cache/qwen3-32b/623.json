So, the question is about a rocket engine ejecting gas and generating thrust. We need to find out the mass of gas ejected per second. The given information is that the gas is ejected at a speed of about 3 km/s, which is 3000 meters per second, and the thrust is 4.8 × 10^6 Newtons. The options are given from A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, thrust in rockets... I remember that thrust is related to the momentum change of the ejected gas. The basic formula for thrust (F) is F = Δp/Δt, where Δp is the change in momentum and Δt is the time. Since the gas is being ejected, the momentum per second would be mass flow rate multiplied by the velocity of the gas. So maybe the formula is F = (mass flow rate) × velocity?\n\nLet me write that down. Thrust F equals the mass flow rate (which is mass per unit time, so Δm/Δt) multiplied by the exhaust velocity (v). So, F = (Δm/Δt) × v. Therefore, if we want to find Δm/Δt, which is the mass ejected per second, we can rearrange the formula: Δm/Δt = F / v.\n\nAlright, let's plug in the numbers. The thrust F is 4.8 × 10^6 N, and the velocity v is 3 km/s, which is 3000 m/s. So Δm/Δt = (4.8 × 10^6 N) / (3000 m/s). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 4.8 × 10^6 divided by 3 × 10^3. Dividing the coefficients: 4.8 / 3 = 1.6. Then the exponents: 10^6 / 10^3 = 10^3. So multiplying those together gives 1.6 × 10^3 kg/s. So the mass ejected per second is 1.6 × 10^3 kg. Looking at the options, that's option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Thrust equals mass flow rate times velocity. Yes, that seems right. Because each second, the rocket is ejecting some mass Δm with velocity v, so the momentum per second is Δm/Δt * v. And since force is rate of change of momentum, that gives the thrust. So the formula is correct. So 4.8e6 divided by 3e3 is indeed 1.6e3. So option B is the correct answer. The other options don't make sense. For example, option A is 1.6e2, which would be 160 kg/s, but that would require lower mass flow for same thrust? No, since if velocity is 3000 m/s, then to get higher force you need more mass. So 4.8e6 N divided by 3e3 m/s gives 1.6e3 kg/s. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be B.\n</think>"}
