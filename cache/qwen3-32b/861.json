Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that for a weak monoprotic acid, HA, it ionizes in water as follows: HA ⇌ H+ + A-. The Ka expression would be [H+][A-]/[HA]. Since it's monoprotic, the concentration of H+ ions should be equal to the concentration of A- ions, right? \n\nGiven the pH is 2.0, that means the concentration of H+ ions is 10^-pH. So, pH = 2.0 implies [H+] = 10^-2.0 = 0.01 M. \n\nWait, but let me check that. Yes, pH is -log[H+], so solving for [H+] gives 10^(-pH). So, 10^-2 is indeed 0.01 M. \n\nSo, [H+] = 0.01 M. Since the acid is monoprotic, the [A-] should also be 0.01 M. \n\nNow, the initial concentration of HA is 0.060 M. But some of it has dissociated into H+ and A-. The amount dissociated would be equal to [H+] which is 0.01 M. Therefore, the concentration of HA at equilibrium would be the initial concentration minus the amount dissociated. That is, [HA] = 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.050 M. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure. If HA dissociates into H+ and A-, then for every mole of HA that dissociates, you get one mole of H+ and one mole of A-. So, if the initial concentration is 0.060 M, and the change is -x for HA, and +x for H+ and A-, then at equilibrium, [H+] = x = 0.01 M. So, x is 0.01. Therefore, [HA] at equilibrium is 0.060 - x = 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.050 M. \n\nSo, substituting into the Ka expression: \n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA] = (0.01)(0.01)/0.050 = (0.0001)/0.050. \n\nCalculating that, 0.0001 divided by 0.05. Let me do that division. 0.0001 / 0.05 = 0.002. Which is 2.0 × 10^-3. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option A is 2.0 × 10^-3. So that would be the answer? But wait, let me check if I made any mistakes here. \n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with weak acids, you have to consider whether the approximation is valid, like assuming x is small compared to the initial concentration. But in this case, x is 0.01, and the initial concentration is 0.060. So 0.01 is 1/6th of 0.06, which is about 16.6%. So that's not negligible. Normally, if x is less than 5% of the initial concentration, we can approximate, but here it's more than 5%, so maybe the approximation isn't valid? Wait, but in this case, we didn't make an approximation. We directly used the given [H+] to find x. So even though x is a significant fraction of the initial concentration, the calculation should still be correct. Because the problem gives us the actual [H+] (from the pH), so we don't need to approximate. \n\nLet me verify. Suppose we didn't make the assumption that [HA] ≈ 0.060 - x. But since we know x is 0.01, we can directly calculate [HA] as 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.050. Therefore, the calculation is exact in this case. \n\nTherefore, Ka = (0.01)^2 / 0.050 = 0.0001 / 0.05 = 0.002 = 2.0 × 10^-3. Which is option A. \n\nBut wait, let me check the answer choices again. The options are:\n\nA: 2.0 × 10^-3 \n\nB: 2.0 × 10^-1 \n\nC: 1.7 × 10^-1 \n\nD: 5.0 × 10^-3 \n\nSo A is 0.002, D is 0.005. So according to my calculation, A is correct. But maybe I did something wrong here? Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using molarity (m) instead of molality? But the question says \"0.060 molar solution\", so that's molarity (M), so concentration is 0.060 M. So that's okay. \n\nAnother possible mistake: Did I use the right formula for Ka? Yes, because for HA dissociating into H+ and A-, the expression is [H+][A-]/[HA]. Since [H+] equals [A-], and both are 0.01, so squared. \n\nAnother check: Let's suppose that the answer is A, then let's see if that makes sense. If Ka is 2.0 × 10^-3, then for a 0.06 M solution, the [H+] would be sqrt(Ka * C) if the approximation is valid. Wait, but here the approximation isn't valid because Ka is not small compared to C. \n\nWait, let me try to calculate [H+] using the exact formula. \n\nFor a weak acid, HA, the exact expression is:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA] = x^2 / (C - x)\n\nWhich rearranges to x^2 + Ka x - Ka C = 0. \n\nBut in this problem, we are given x = 0.01, and C = 0.06. So plugging into the equation:\n\n(0.01)^2 + Ka*(0.01) - Ka*(0.06) = 0 ?\n\nWait, no, the quadratic equation is x^2 + Ka x - Ka*C = 0? Wait, let me rederive it. \n\nStarting from Ka = x^2 / (C - x). Multiply both sides by (C - x):\n\nKa (C - x) = x^2 \n\nKa*C - Ka x = x^2 \n\nRearranged:\n\nx^2 + Ka x - Ka C = 0 \n\nSo yes, quadratic in x. \n\nBut here, we can solve for Ka if we know x, C. \n\nFrom Ka (C - x) = x^2 \n\nTherefore, Ka = x^2 / (C - x) \n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier. So Ka = (0.01)^2 / (0.06 - 0.01) = 0.0001 / 0.05 = 0.002. \n\nTherefore, Ka is 0.002, which is 2.0 × 10^-3. So answer A. \n\nBut let me check if the answer choices might have a trick. For example, if someone forgot to subtract x from C, they might have done x^2 / C = (0.01)^2 / 0.06 = 0.0001 / 0.06 ≈ 0.001666..., which is approximately 1.7 × 10^-3, which is close to option D? Wait, no. 0.001666 is 1.666 × 10^-3, which is approximately 1.7 × 10^-3, which is option C? Wait, looking back:\n\nOption C is 1.7 × 10^-1, which is 0.17. That can't be. Wait, no:\n\nOriginal answer choices:\n\nA: 2.0 × 10^-3 \n\nB: 2.0 × 10^-1 \n\nC: 1.7 × 10^-1 \n\nD: 5.0 × 10^-3 \n\nAh, so option C is 0.17, which is way bigger. Option D is 0.005. So if someone forgot to subtract x, they would get 0.0001 / 0.06 ≈ 0.001666, which is 1.666 × 10^-3 ≈ 1.7 × 10^-3. But none of the options have that. Wait, option A is 2.0 × 10^-3, which is 0.002. So if you do the exact calculation, you get 0.002. If you do the approximation (assuming x is small), you get 0.001666. But since in this case, x is not small, the exact calculation is necessary. Therefore, answer A is correct. \n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in calculation. \n\n0.01 squared is 0.0001. Divided by (0.06 - 0.01) which is 0.05. 0.0001 / 0.05. Let me compute that again. \n\n0.05 goes into 0.0001 how many times? 0.05 * 0.002 = 0.0001. Yes. So 0.0001 / 0.05 = 0.002. So that is 2.0 × 10^-3. So answer A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A, B, C, D. The problem is from a test, maybe there's a trick? For example, sometimes when dealing with weak acids, people might confuse Ka with Kb, but that's not the case here. Also, maybe the solution is not assuming that [H+] equals [A-]?\n\nWait, in reality, for a weak acid, the [H+] comes not only from the acid dissociation but also from water autoionization. However, in this case, the pH is 2.0, which is quite low, so the contribution from water is negligible. So assuming [H+] ≈ [A-] is valid. \n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. The answer is A. \n\nBut let me check if the question says \"monoprotic\" which it does. So yes, one H+ per molecule. \n\nAnother possible mistake: Maybe the student confuses molarity with molality? But the question says \"0.060 molar solution\", so that's molarity (M), not molality (m). So no problem there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the student thought that the concentration of HA is 0.060 M and forgot to subtract the dissociated part? But as I showed, that would give a different answer. But since the answer is not among the options except for A, I think my reasoning is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: 2.0 × 10^-3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
