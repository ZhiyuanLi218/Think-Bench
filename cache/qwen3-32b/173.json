The user provided an unbalanced chemical equation: Zn + HBr = ZnBr2H2. Hmm, first I need to figure out what the correct products should be here. Wait, the right side is written as ZnBr2H2. That might be a typo or shorthand. In reality, when zinc reacts with hydrobromic acid (HBr), the products should be zinc bromide (ZnBr2) and hydrogen gas (H2). So maybe the user meant ZnBr2 + H2 instead of ZnBr2H2. Let me confirm that.\n\nZinc is a metal, and when it reacts with an acid like HBr, a single displacement reaction occurs. The general reaction is metal + acid → salt + hydrogen gas. So Zn (zinc) reacting with HBr (hydrobromic acid) should produce ZnBr2 (zinc bromide) and H2 (hydrogen gas). So the correct unbalanced equation should be Zn + HBr → ZnBr2 + H2.\n\nNow, let's balance this equation. Let's start by counting the atoms on each side. On the left, we have 1 Zn, 1 H, 1 Br. On the right, we have 1 Zn, 2 Br, and 2 H in the H2. So first, let's balance the bromine atoms. There's 1 Br in HBr on the left and 2 Br in ZnBr2 on the right. To balance Br, we need 2 HBr molecules on the left. That gives us 2 Br and 2 H on the left. Now the equation is Zn + 2HBr → ZnBr2 + H2.\n\nNow check the hydrogen. On the left, we have 2 H from 2 HBr. On the right, H2 has 2 H. So hydrogen is balanced. Zinc is 1 on each side. Bromine is 2 on each side. So the balanced equation is Zn + 2HBr → ZnBr2 + H2.\n\nWait, but the user wrote the product as ZnBr2H2. Maybe they combined the two products into one formula? That's not standard. The correct products are separate: ZnBr2 and H2. So the correct balanced equation is Zn + 2HBr → ZnBr2 + H2. Let me double-check by counting all atoms again. Left side: 1 Zn, 2 H, 2 Br. Right side: 1 Zn, 2 Br (from ZnBr2) and 2 H (from H2). Yep, all balanced. So the balanced equation is Zn + 2HBr → ZnBr2 + H2. That should be the answer.\n</think>"}
