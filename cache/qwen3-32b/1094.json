The problem mentions that there are 18 electrons, but since they say to assume no interaction between the electrons, I guess I can treat each electron independently, right? So it's like a particle on a ring problem. Let me recall what I know about particles on a ring.\n\nFirst, the particle on a ring is a quantum mechanics problem where a particle is confined to move in a circular path. The solutions to the Schrödinger equation for this system are similar to the particle in a box but in polar coordinates. The wavefunctions should be periodic in angle, so they need to satisfy boundary conditions that make them single-valued when going around the ring.\n\nLet me start by writing down the Schrödinger equation for a single particle on a ring. The ring has radius r, so the circumference is 2πr. Let me denote the angle around the ring as φ, which goes from 0 to 2π. The kinetic energy operator in this case would involve the angular part of the Laplacian. Since the particle is moving in one dimension (the circumference of the ring), the Hamiltonian should be the kinetic energy operator.\n\nThe kinetic energy is given by (p²)/(2m), where p is the momentum. But in polar coordinates, the angular momentum operator is important here. For a ring, the angular momentum L is related to the linear momentum p by L = r × p. Since the motion is purely tangential, the angular momentum magnitude is L = r*p. Therefore, the kinetic energy can also be written as L²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia for a particle on a ring is I = m*r², so substituting back, the kinetic energy becomes L²/(2m*r²). \n\nBut maybe it's easier to write the Schrödinger equation in terms of φ. The Laplacian in polar coordinates for a ring reduces to the second derivative with respect to φ, scaled by (r²). So the Hamiltonian H is:\n\nH = - (ħ²/(2m)) * (1/r²) * d²/dφ²\n\nWait, let me check. The Laplacian in polar coordinates for a 2D problem is (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dφ²). But since our particle is constrained to the ring of radius r, there's no radial dependence, so dr/dφ is zero. Therefore, the Laplacian reduces to (1/r²)(d²/dφ²). Therefore, the Hamiltonian is:\n\nH = - (ħ²/(2m)) * (1/r²) * d²/dφ²\n\nYes, that seems right. So the time-independent Schrödinger equation is:\n\nHψ(φ) = Eψ(φ)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m r²)) * d²ψ/dφ² = Eψ\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nd²ψ/dφ² + (2m E r² / ħ²) ψ = 0\n\nLet me define a constant k² = (2m E r²)/ħ². Then the equation becomes:\n\nd²ψ/dφ² + k² ψ = 0\n\nThis is the same differential equation as the particle in a ring or the free particle on a circle. The general solution is:\n\nψ(φ) = A e^{i k φ} + B e^{-i k φ}\n\nBut we need to apply boundary conditions. Since the ring is a closed loop, the wavefunction must be single-valued. That means ψ(φ + 2π) = ψ(φ). Let's apply this condition.\n\nSuppose ψ(φ) = A e^{i m φ} where m is some integer. Then ψ(φ + 2π) = A e^{i m (φ + 2π)} = A e^{i m φ} e^{i m 2π} = A e^{i m φ} * e^{i 2π m} = ψ(φ) * e^{i 2π m}. For this to equal ψ(φ), we need e^{i 2π m} = 1. Which is true if m is an integer. Therefore, m must be an integer. So the solutions are ψ_m(φ) = A e^{i m φ}, where m is integer.\n\nBut in the general solution above, k must be such that k φ is dimensionless. Wait, φ is dimensionless (it's an angle), so k is dimensionless? Wait, no. Let me check the units. The original equation:\n\nd²ψ/dφ² + k² ψ = 0, where k² = (2m E r²)/ħ². Therefore, k² must be dimensionless, since φ is dimensionless. So k is dimensionless. Therefore, m must be dimensionless. So m is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the allowed values of k are integers. Let me denote m as integer, then k = m. Therefore, the energy levels are given by:\n\nE_m = (ħ² k²)/(2m r²) = (ħ² m²)/(2m r²) ?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, k² = (2m E r²)/ħ², so solving for E:\n\nE = (ħ² k²)/(2m r²). But k is equal to m (the integer)? Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express. Earlier, I set k² = (2m E r²)/ħ². Then, the differential equation is d²ψ/dφ² + k² ψ = 0. The solutions are e^{i m φ} where m is integer. Therefore, comparing with the general solution, if we have ψ = e^{i m φ}, then d²ψ/dφ² = -m² ψ. Therefore, substituting into the equation:\n\n- m² ψ + k² ψ = 0 => k² = m² => k = ±m. Therefore, the energy E is:\n\nE = (ħ² k²)/(2m r²) = (ħ² m²)/(2m r²) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original expression was k² = (2m E r²)/ħ². Therefore, solving for E:\n\nE = (ħ² k²)/(2m r²). Since k² = m² (where m is integer), then:\n\nE_m = (ħ² m²)/(2m r²) ?\n\nWait, that seems like m cancels? Wait, no. Wait, hold on. The k here is dimensionless, but in the equation k² = (2m E r²)/ħ². So solving for E:\n\nE = (ħ² k²)/(2m r²). But k is m (the integer)? Wait, no. Wait, let me check again.\n\nIf the differential equation is d²ψ/dφ² + k² ψ = 0, and the solution is ψ = e^{i m φ}, then substituting gives:\n\nd²ψ/dφ² = -m² e^{i m φ}, so:\n\n- m² ψ + k² ψ = 0 => k² = m² => k = ±m. Therefore, k is m. So substituting back into E:\n\nE = (ħ² k²)/(2m r²) = (ħ² m²)/(2m r²). Wait, but here m is the integer. Wait, but the m in the denominator is mass? Wait, hold on! There's confusion between the integer m and the mass m. Oh no! That's a problem. Let me correct that.\n\nLet me use different notation. Let me denote the integer as n instead of m to avoid confusion with mass. So let me rewrite:\n\nFrom the differential equation, we have k² = (2M E r²)/ħ², where M is the mass of the electron. Then, solving for E:\n\nE = (ħ² k²)/(2M r²). And since k² = n² (from the boundary conditions where n is integer), then:\n\nE_n = (ħ² n²)/(2M r²). Okay, that makes sense. So the energy levels are quantized with quantum number n, which is integer (positive or negative? Well, since n² is same for n and -n, so energy levels are degenerate for ±n except n=0).\n\nTherefore, the energy eigenfunctions are ψ_n(φ) = A e^{i n φ}, where n is integer. Now, we need to normalize these wavefunctions.\n\nThe normalization condition is ∫ |ψ(φ)|² r dφ = 1, since the circumference is 2πr, and dφ is the angle element. Wait, but when integrating around the ring, the infinitesimal arc length is r dφ. However, since we are dealing with a one-dimensional problem where φ is the coordinate, the integration measure is just dφ multiplied by the circumference? Wait, no. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the wavefunction is defined such that the integral of |ψ|² over all space is 1. Here, the \"space\" is the ring, which has length L = 2πr. However, if we parametrize the ring by φ from 0 to 2π, then the actual arc length is r dφ. But if we are treating φ as the coordinate, then the integration measure is dφ. Wait, but in reality, the wavefunction is defined per unit length. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me think. If we have a particle on a ring of radius r, parametrized by angle φ. The actual position along the ring is s = r φ, where s is the arc length. The wavefunction ψ(s) must satisfy ∫ |ψ(s)|² ds = 1. Since ds = r dφ, then ∫ |ψ(s)|² ds = ∫ |ψ(φ)|² r dφ = 1. Therefore, if we write ψ(φ) as a function of φ, then the normalization is ∫₀^{2π} |ψ(φ)|² r dφ = 1. Therefore, if we have ψ_n(φ) = A e^{i n φ}, then:\n\n|ψ_n(φ)|² = |A|².\n\nTherefore, ∫₀^{2π} |A|² r dφ = |A|² r ∫₀^{2π} dφ = |A|² r * 2π = 1 => |A|² = 1/(2π r) => A = 1/√(2π r).\n\nTherefore, the normalized wavefunctions are:\n\nψ_n(φ) = 1/√(2π r) e^{i n φ}, where n is integer.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Let me recall standard particle on a ring. In some references, they might use different coordinates. For example, if you consider the ring as a 1D system with periodic boundary conditions, the wavefunctions are similar to free particles with periodic boundary conditions. The normalization can depend on how you define the coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider φ as a dimensionless coordinate from 0 to 2π, then the integral over φ would be from 0 to 2π, and the normalization would be 1/√(2π) e^{i n φ} because ∫ |ψ|² dφ = 1. However, in our case, the actual physical length is 2πr, so the integral over φ must include the factor of r. Therefore, the correct normalization is 1/√(2π r).\n\nTherefore, the normalized single-particle energy eigenfunctions are ψ_n(φ) = 1/√(2π r) e^{i n φ}, with n integer.\n\nBut let me check again. Suppose r is given as 4, but in the problem statement, they say \"Ring radius r = 4\". Wait, units? The problem says \"radius r = 4\", but no units. Maybe it's in angstroms or something, but since we are just writing the eigenfunctions, the numerical value of r is 4, so we can just plug that in.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenfunctions would be ψ_n(φ) = 1/√(2π * 4) e^{i n φ} = 1/√(8π) e^{i n φ} ?\n\nBut maybe they just want the general form with r, so since the problem says \"radius r = 4\", perhaps we can write it with r = 4. But the question says \"Write down the normalized single-particle energy eigenfunctions...\", so probably they want the expression in terms of r, with r given as 4. However, since the problem didn't specify units, maybe we can just leave it in terms of r, but since r is given, perhaps substitute r = 4. Let me check the exact wording.\n\nThe problem says: \"Ring radius r = 4 (units not specified). Write down the normalized single-particle energy eigenfunctions...\" So I think they just want the form with r plugged in as 4. So the answer would be ψ_n(φ) = 1/√(8π) e^{i n φ}, with n integer.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. The normalization integral:\n\n∫ |ψ(φ)|² r dφ from 0 to 2π equals 1. If ψ(φ) = A e^{i n φ}, then |A|² ∫ r dφ from 0 to 2π is |A|² * r * 2π = 1 => |A| = 1/√(2π r). Therefore, with r = 4, A = 1/√(8π). So yes.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenfunctions are ψ_n(φ) = 1/√(8π) e^{i n φ}, where n is any integer (positive, negative, zero). These are the single-particle energy eigenfunctions.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"assuming there is no interaction between the electrons.\" Since electrons are fermions, we would usually have to consider the Pauli exclusion principle, but the question specifically says to write down the normalized single-particle energy eigenfunctions. So they are not asking about the many-body wavefunction or filling the orbitals with electrons; they just want the single-particle states. Therefore, even though there are 18 electrons, each electron would occupy these single-particle states, with appropriate quantum numbers considering spin and exclusion. But the question is only about the single-particle energy eigenfunctions, so the answer is as above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is ψ_n(φ) = 1/√(8π) e^{i n φ} for integer n. But let me check if there is another way to write this. Sometimes, the wavefunctions are written as a combination of sine and cosine, but since we are dealing with complex exponentials, the standard form is the complex exponential. Also, sometimes people write the wavefunctions as ψ_n(φ) = (1/√(2π r)) e^{i n φ} with n integer. Since r is given as 4, substituting gives 1/√(8π).\n\nAlternatively, if they expect the answer in terms of r, even though r is given as 4, maybe they want it written with r. But the problem says \"write down the normalized...\", so probably they want the numerical value since r is given. Therefore, with r = 4, it's 1/√(8π).\n\nBut let me check if there's another convention. For example, sometimes the normalization is done such that the integral over φ (without the r factor) is 1. But that would not account for the actual length of the ring. Since the wavefunction depends on position, which is along the circumference, the correct normalization must include the factor of r. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/√(2π r).\n\nTherefore, with r = 4, it is 1/√(8π). Therefore, the eigenfunctions are:\n\nψ_n(φ) = (1/√(8π)) e^{i n φ}, where n is any integer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check with dimensional analysis. The wavefunction ψ has units of 1/√(length), because ∫ |ψ|² ds = 1, and ds has units of length. Therefore, |ψ|² has units 1/length, so ψ has units 1/√(length). In our case, the normalization factor is 1/√(8π), which is 1/√(length) because r has units of length. Since r = 4 (assuming units of length), then yes, 1/√(8π) has units 1/√(length). Therefore, this is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct answer. The normalized single-particle energy eigenfunctions are ψ_n(φ) = 1/√(8π) e^{i n φ} with integer n.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe normalized single-particle energy eigenfunctions are \\boxed{\\psi_n(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8\\pi}} e^{i n \\phi}} where $ n $ is any integer.\n</think>"}
