To analyze its motion, we must consider the **Lorentz force law**, which governs the force experienced by a charged particle in a magnetic field:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = q (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ q $ is the charge of the particle (positive for a proton),\n- $ \\mathbf{v} $ is the velocity vector of the proton,\n- $ \\mathbf{B} $ is the magnetic field vector.\n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n- **Direction of Motion and Magnetic Field:** In this scenario, the proton's velocity vector is **parallel** to the magnetic field vector (since it is moving along the axis of the solenoid).\n  \n- **Cross Product Implication:** The cross product $ \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} $ becomes zero when $ \\mathbf{v} $ is parallel to $ \\mathbf{B} $, because the sine of the angle between them is zero. Hence, the **magnetic force is zero**.\n\n- **No Acceleration:** Since the magnetic force is zero, the proton experiences **no acceleration** in any direction. Therefore, it continues to move in a **straight line at constant velocity**.\n\n- **No External Forces Mentioned:** The problem does not mention any electric field or other forces acting on the proton, so the only force to consider is the magnetic one — and it is zero in this case.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n- **Option A (Parabolic path):** This would occur if the proton were subject to a **constant perpendicular force**, such as in an electric field. Not the case here.\n\n- **Option B (Circular path):** This would occur if the proton's velocity were **perpendicular** to the magnetic field, leading to a centripetal force. Again, not applicable here.\n\n- **Option C (Straight path at constant velocity):** This is consistent with the analysis. No net force implies no change in motion.\n\n- **Option D (Straight path and slowing down):** Slowing down would require a **force opposite** to the direction of motion. Since the magnetic force is zero, this is not possible in this scenario.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what happens to a proton when it enters a solenoid. Let me start by recalling what a solenoid is. A solenoid is basically a coil of wire, right? When you pass an electric current through it, it creates a magnetic field inside. I remember that the magnetic field inside a solenoid is pretty uniform and runs parallel to the axis of the solenoid. The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule: if you curl your fingers in the direction of the current, your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nNow, the question says that a proton enters the solenoid and is moving along the axis. So, the proton's velocity is in the same direction as the magnetic field inside the solenoid. I need to remember how charged particles move in magnetic fields. The force on a moving charge in a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force law. The formula is F = q(v × B), where q is the charge, v is the velocity vector, and B is the magnetic field vector. The cross product here means that the force depends on the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field.\n\nSince the proton is moving along the axis of the solenoid, its velocity vector is parallel to the magnetic field vector. When two vectors are parallel, their cross product is zero because the sine of the angle between them (which is 0 degrees) is zero. So, the magnetic force on the proton should be zero. If there's no force acting on the proton, then according to Newton's first law, it should continue moving in a straight line at constant velocity. \n\nLet me check if there are any other factors I might be missing. The solenoid's magnetic field is uniform and only along the axis. There's no electric field mentioned here, so the only force would be the magnetic one. Since the proton's motion is aligned with the magnetic field, there's no perpendicular component causing it to bend. Therefore, the proton shouldn't experience any force that would make it change direction or speed. \n\nLooking at the answer choices: \n\nA says it will be bent in a parabolic path. That would happen if there was a force acting perpendicular to the motion, like in an electric field, but here the magnetic field is parallel, so no. \n\nB is a circular path. That would happen if the velocity was perpendicular to the magnetic field, causing centripetal force. But again, here the velocity is parallel, so no circular motion. \n\nC says it continues straight at constant velocity. That seems to fit with what I was thinking because no force means no acceleration. \n\nD says it continues straight but slows down. Slowing down would require a force opposite to the direction of motion. But since the magnetic force is zero, there's no reason for it to slow down unless there's another force, which the problem doesn't mention. \n\nSo the correct answer should be C. Wait, but I should make sure I didn't confuse electric and magnetic fields. If the proton were moving perpendicular to the magnetic field, then it would go in a circle. If it's moving parallel, no force. So yes, C makes sense. The proton keeps going straight with the same speed. So answer C.\n</think>"}
