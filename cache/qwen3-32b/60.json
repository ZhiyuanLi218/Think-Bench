In traditional Chinese porcelain, the blue coloration in glazes—especially in famous blue-and-white porcelain—is typically derived from **cobalt oxide**, not iron oxide. Iron oxides usually produce more **red, brown, or green** hues, depending on the firing conditions. The poetic description of the blue color may refer to a **celadon** or **blue glaze**, but these are not caused by iron. Therefore, **Option A is scientifically inaccurate**.\n\n---\n\n**Option B**: *\"The world-renowned Terracotta Warriors are pottery products, made by high-temperature sintering of clay.\"*\n\nThis is **correct**. The Terracotta Army, created during the Qin Dynasty, is indeed made from **clay** and formed using **high-temperature sintering**, a process typical in pottery and ceramics. This statement aligns with archaeological and historical evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Option C**: *\"Ceramics are one of the earliest artificial materials used, and their main chemical component is silicate.\"*\n\nThis is **correct**. Ceramics, including pottery and porcelain, are among the **oldest artificial materials**. Their primary chemical composition is **silicates**, particularly **aluminosilicates** in the case of clay, which is the main raw material in ceramic production.\n\n---\n\n**Option D**: *\"Ceramics have stable chemical properties, with advantages such as resistance to acid and alkali erosion, and oxidation resistance.\"*\n\nThis is **correct**. Ceramics are known for their **chemical stability**, **acid and alkali resistance**, and **high thermal and oxidation resistance**, making them suitable for various industrial and artistic applications.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about ceramics and which statement is incorrect. The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each statement says. \n\nOption A: The porcelain's blue color described as \"after the rain, the sky clears and the clouds break\" comes from iron oxide. Hmm, I remember that in ceramics, different metal oxides are used as colorants. For example, cobalt oxide is known for producing blue colors in porcelain. Iron oxide usually gives a different color, maybe a brown or red when fired. The phrase \"after the rain, the sky clears and the clouds break\" might refer to a specific type of blue glaze, like celadon or something else. Wait, celadon is a greenish color from iron in reduction firing. So if the blue is from iron oxide, maybe that's incorrect because iron typically gives a different color. So A might be wrong.\n\nOption B: Terracotta Warriors are pottery products made by high-temperature sintering of clay. Terracotta is a type of earthenware, and the Terracotta Warriors were made using clay. They were fired at high temperatures, so B sounds correct. Sintering is part of the process, so B is probably correct.\n\nOption C: Ceramics are among the earliest artificial materials, with main component silicate. Yes, ceramics like pottery are ancient. The main components are usually silicates, like clay, which is aluminum silicate. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: Ceramics have stable chemical properties, resistant to acid/alkali, oxidation. Ceramics are known for their chemical stability. They are generally resistant to acids and bases, and don't oxidize easily. So D is correct.\n\nSo the incorrect statement is A. The blue color is more likely from cobalt oxide, not iron oxide. Iron would give a different color. Therefore, the answer is A.\n</think>"}
