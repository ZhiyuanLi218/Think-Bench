I need to figure out the mass ratio between two binary star systems based on their orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. Hmm. So, binary stars orbit each other, right? And when they eclipse, that means they're in a configuration where their orbital plane is edge-on from our perspective. The period between primary eclipses is the orbital period. So system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.\n\nNow, the radial velocity amplitudes. For each star in a binary system, their velocities vary sinusoidally as they orbit the center of mass. The amplitude of that velocity is related to their orbital radius and the mass of the other star. The formula that connects these is probably the one from Kepler's laws, modified for binary systems. \n\nI remember that for a binary system, the orbital period relates to the semi-major axis and the total mass. The formula is something like P² = (a³)/(M_total), where P is in years, a is in AU, and M_total is in solar masses. But wait, that's the simplified version assuming circular orbits and using astronomical units. But here, we might need to use the more general form involving velocities and the center of mass.\n\nLet me recall. The radial velocity amplitude (K) of a star in a binary system is given by K = (2π a₁)/P, where a₁ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass. But since the stars are orbiting each other, the semi-major axes of their orbits relate to their masses. Specifically, a₁/a₂ = m₂/m₁. So the ratio of their velocities would be related to the ratio of their masses as well. \n\nAlso, the total mass of the system can be found using the formula that combines the velocities and the period. There's a formula called the mass function, which is something like f(m) = (m₂ sin i)^3 / (m_total)^2 = (P K^3)/(2π G). But since we have eclipses, the inclination i is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. That simplifies things. \n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula that combines the velocities and the period to get the total mass. Let me think. If each star's velocity is K1 and K2, then their orbital speeds are related to their distances from the center of mass. Since they orbit with the same period, their velocities are proportional to their orbital radii. \n\nLet me denote m1 and m2 as the masses of the two stars in a system. Then, their distances from the center of mass (a1 and a2) satisfy m1 a1 = m2 a2. Also, the orbital velocities are v1 = 2π a1 / P and v2 = 2π a2 / P. Therefore, v1/v2 = a1/a2 = m2/m1. \n\nSo, if we have the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 for each star, then K1/K2 = m2/m1. Therefore, m1/m2 = K2/K1. For example, in system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5? Wait, but that would mean m1 is half of m2. But if K1 is larger, that would mean the star is moving faster, so it's less massive. Yeah, because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit. So if one star is moving faster, it's less massive. So in system_1, the ratio of masses is m1/m2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 m2. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2. Wait, but maybe I need to express it in terms of the velocities and the period. \n\nBut actually, to get the total mass of the system, we can use Kepler's third law. Let me recall the formula. For a binary system, the total mass M_total = m1 + m2 = ( (a^3 ) / P^2 ) where a is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit. But we need to express a in terms of the velocities. \n\nAlternatively, using the radial velocities. Since each star's velocity is K1 = (2π a1)/P and K2 = (2π a2)/P. Then, since a1 + a2 = a, the semi-major axis of the relative orbit. Also, from the center of mass condition, m1 a1 = m2 a2. So, a2 = (m1/m2) a1. Therefore, a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + m1/m2). \n\nBut we also know that K1 = 2π a1 / P => a1 = (K1 P)/(2π). Similarly, a2 = (K2 P)/(2π). Then, adding them, a = (K1 + K2) P / (2π). \n\nNow, using Kepler's third law. In SI units, it's P² = (4π²/G(M_total)) a³. But if we use astronomical units and years, maybe we can avoid the constants. Let me check. \n\nIn the astronomical unit system where G is set so that for the sun, 1 year period and 1 AU, the formula is P² = a³ / M_total, where M_total is in solar masses. Wait, no, actually Kepler's third law is P² = (a³)/(M_total) when P is in years, a in AU, and M_total in solar masses. But here, we need to express a in AU. \n\nBut how do we get a from the velocities? Let me think. The semi-major axis a is (K1 + K2) P / (2π). But the units here are velocity times time over length? Wait, velocity is in km/s, P is in years. Hmm. Maybe I need to convert units properly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula that combines the velocities, period, and gives the total mass. Let me recall. The mass function for eclipsing binaries where inclination is 90 degrees (so sin i = 1) can be given by:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( G * (2π)^2 )\n\nBut that seems complicated. Wait, maybe using the formula derived from combining Kepler's law and the velocity expressions. Let me try again. \n\nWe have:\n\na = (K1 + K2) * P / (2π)\n\nBut a³ / P² = G M_total / (4π²)\n\nTherefore, substituting a:\n\n[( (K1 + K2) * P / (2π) )³ ] / P² = G M_total / (4π²)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n( (K1 + K2)^3 * P³ ) / (8 π³) ) / P² = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (8 π³ )\n\nSet equal to right side:\n\n( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (8 π³ ) = G M_total / (4 π² )\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 π³:\n\n(K1 + K2)^3 * P = 2 G π M_total\n\nTherefore:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G π )\n\nBut this requires knowing G and converting all units properly. However, since we need to compare the masses of the two systems, maybe we can take the ratio of M_total for system 1 to M_total for system 2, which would eliminate G and π and other constants, as long as we use consistent units. \n\nSo, M1 / M2 = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) ] / [ ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) ]\n\nWhere K1a and K1b are the velocity amplitudes for system 1, and similarly for system 2. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. For system 1, K1a = 10 km/s, K1b = 5 km/s. So sum is 15 km/s. For system 2, K2a = 15 km/s, K2b = 10 km/s. Sum is 25 km/s. The periods are P1 = 2 years, P2 = 1 year. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is [ (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) ) ] \n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst compute 15³ = 3375\n\n25³ = 15625\n\nSo numerator: 3375 * 2 = 6750\n\nDenominator: 15625 * 1 = 15625\n\nSo ratio is 6750 / 15625. Let me compute that. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 ÷25 = 270, 15625 ÷25 = 625.\n\n270 / 625. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 5: 54 / 125. \n\nWhich is 0.432. So approximately 0.43. The answer options are 0.7, 0.6, 1.2, 0.4. So closest is 0.4, which is option D. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again. Because I might have made a mistake in the formula. \n\nEarlier, I derived M_total proportional to ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ). But is that correct? Let me check again. \n\nWe had:\n\nFrom Kepler's law:\n\na³ / P² = G M_total / (4 π² )\n\nAnd a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π )\n\nSo substituting a into the first equation:\n\n[ ( (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π ) )³ ] / P² = G M_total / (4 π² )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n( (K1 + K2)^3 * P³ ) / (8 π³ ) ) / P² = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (8 π³ )\n\nSet equal to right side:\n\n( K1 + K2 )³ * P / (8 π³ ) = G M_total / (4 π² )\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 π³:\n\n( K1 + K2 )³ * P = 2 π G M_total \n\nTherefore:\n\nM_total = ( K1 + K2 )³ * P / ( 2 π G )\n\nSo yes, M_total is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So when taking the ratio between two systems, the constants cancel out. Therefore, the ratio is indeed [ (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) ] = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. So approximately 0.43, which is closest to option D: ~0.4. \n\nBut let me check if there's an error in assuming that (K1 + K2) is the sum of the velocities. Wait, in the formula for a, we said a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π ). But K1 and K2 are the velocities of each star. Since each star's orbit has a semi-major axis a1 and a2, with a1 + a2 = a (the semi-major axis of the relative orbit). And since K1 = 2 π a1 / P, K2 = 2 π a2 / P, then adding gives K1 + K2 = 2 π (a1 + a2)/P = 2 π a / P. Therefore, solving for a gives a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π ). So that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the formula for M_total is correct. So the ratio is indeed approximately 0.43, which is closest to 0.4. Therefore, the answer is D. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The question says \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if the ratio M1/M2 ≈ 0.43, that would mean system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2, i.e., less massive. But the options are phrased as \"by what factor is system_1 more massive...\" So if the answer is less than 1, that would mean system_1 is less massive. However, the options given are 0.7, 0.6, 1.2, 0.4. So if the ratio is ~0.4, then system_1 is 0.4 times the mass of system_2, which is answer D. But the question is phrased as \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if the factor is less than 1, that would mean system_1 is less massive. However, the options include 0.4 as D. The question might be a bit ambiguous. Wait, the options are labeled as A to D. Let me check the exact wording again. \n\nThe question says: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.\" \n\nSo if M1 is less than M2, then the factor is less than 1, and the answer is D: ~0.4. But the options are given as A: ~0.7, B: ~0.6, C: ~1.2, D: ~0.4. So according to my calculation, the answer is D. \n\nBut let me check once more if I messed up the formula. For example, maybe I should have used the individual velocities and mass ratios. Wait, another approach. Let me try to compute the individual masses for each system. \n\nFor system_1: K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s. Period P1 = 2 years. \n\nFrom the velocity ratio, K1/K2 = v1/v2 = m2/m1. Therefore, m1/m2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 m2. \n\nTotal mass M1 = m1 + m2 = 1.5 m2. \n\nNow, using Kepler's law to find m2. \n\nBut how? Let me recall that for a binary system, the formula involving the velocities and period can be used to get the individual masses. \n\nThe formula for the mass of each star is:\n\nm1 = (K2^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G ) * (1 / (K1 + K2)^2 ) * something... Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, using the mass function. \n\nBut since we have eclipses, i = 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. The mass function for each star is:\n\nFor star 1: f(m1) = (m2 sin i)^3 / (m1 + m2)^2 = (K1^3 * P ) / (2 π G )\n\nSimilarly for star 2. \n\nBut maybe combining these. Let me try. \n\nFor system 1:\n\nLet me write the mass function for star 1:\n\nm2³ / (m1 + m2)² = (K1³ P ) / (2 π G )\n\nSimilarly, for star 2:\n\nm1³ / (m1 + m2)² = (K2³ P ) / (2 π G )\n\nTherefore, taking the ratio of the two equations:\n\n(m2³ / m1³ ) = (K1³ / K2³ )\n\nWhich gives (m2/m1)^3 = (K1/K2)^3 => m2/m1 = K1/K2, which is consistent with what we had before. So m1/m2 = K2/K1 = 0.5. \n\nSo m1 = 0.5 m2, and total mass M1 = 1.5 m2. \n\nNow, to find m2, we can use the total mass formula. Let me recall that M_total = ( (a)^3 ) / (P² ), where a is in AU, P in years, and M_total in solar masses. But we need to express a in terms of velocities. \n\nEarlier, we had a = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π ). But we need to convert the units of velocity and period into AU and years. \n\nLet me do that. \n\nFirst, convert K1 and K2 into AU/year. \n\nThe velocity is given in km/s. Let's convert that to AU/year. \n\nFirst, 1 AU = 1.496 × 10^8 km. \n\n1 year ≈ 3.154 × 10^7 seconds. \n\nSo velocity in AU/year is (km/s) * (seconds per year) / (km per AU). \n\nSo for system 1, K1 + K2 = 15 km/s. \n\nConvert 15 km/s to AU/year:\n\n15 km/s * 3.154e7 s/year / 1.496e8 km/AU \n\nCalculate that:\n\nNumerator: 15 * 3.154e7 ≈ 4.731e8 km/year \n\nDivide by 1.496e8 km/AU: ≈ 4.731e8 / 1.496e8 ≈ 3.16 AU/year \n\nSo a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π ) \n\nFor system 1, P = 2 years. \n\nSo a = 3.16 AU/year * 2 years / (2 π ) ≈ 3.16 * 2 / (6.283) ≈ 6.32 / 6.283 ≈ 1.006 AU \n\nSo a ≈ 1 AU. \n\nThen, using Kepler's third law, P² = a³ / M_total. \n\nSo for system 1: (2)^2 = (1)^3 / M_total => 4 = 1 / M_total => M_total = 1/4 solar masses? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, Kepler's third law is P² = a³ / M_total when M_total is in solar masses, P in years, a in AU. So if P² = a³ / M_total, then M_total = a³ / P². \n\nFor system 1, a ≈ 1 AU, P = 2 years. \n\nM_total = (1)^3 / (2)^2 = 1 / 4 = 0.25 solar masses. \n\nBut earlier, we had M_total = 1.5 m2. So 1.5 m2 = 0.25 solar masses => m2 = 0.25 / 1.5 ≈ 0.167 solar masses. \n\nBut let's check if the calculation of a is correct. \n\nWait, I approximated a ≈ 1 AU. Let me redo the calculation more accurately. \n\nFirst, compute K1 + K2 = 15 km/s. \n\nConvert to AU/year:\n\n15 km/s * 3.154e7 s/yr / 1.496e8 km/AU \n\nCalculate 15 * 3.154e7 = 15 * 3.154 × 10^7 ≈ 47.31 × 10^7 km/yr \n\nDivide by 1.496 × 10^8 km/AU: \n\n47.31 × 10^7 / 1.496 × 10^8 ≈ (47.31 / 1.496) × (10^7 / 10^8) ≈ 31.63 × 0.1 ≈ 3.163 AU/yr \n\nSo yes, 3.163 AU/yr. \n\nThen, a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π ) \n\nFor system 1, P = 2 years. \n\nSo a = 3.163 AU/yr * 2 yr / (2 π ) = 3.163 / π ≈ 1.008 AU \n\nSo a ≈ 1.008 AU. \n\nThen, M_total = a³ / P² ≈ (1.008)^3 / (2)^2 ≈ 1.024 / 4 ≈ 0.256 solar masses. \n\nSo approximately 0.256 solar masses for system 1. \n\nNow, let's do the same for system 2. \n\nSystem 2 has K1 = 15 km/s, K2 = 10 km/s. So sum is 25 km/s. Period P2 = 1 year. \n\nConvert 25 km/s to AU/year: \n\n25 * 3.154e7 / 1.496e8 ≈ 25 * 3.154 / 1.496 * 0.1 ≈ 25 * 2.108 * 0.1 ≈ 25 * 0.2108 ≈ 5.27 AU/yr \n\nWait, let me calculate more accurately:\n\n25 km/s * 3.154e7 s/yr = 25 * 3.154 × 10^7 ≈ 78.85 × 10^7 km/yr \n\nDivide by 1.496 × 10^8 km/AU: \n\n78.85 × 10^7 / 1.496 × 10^8 = 78.85 / 1.496 × 10^(7-8) = 52.7 × 10^-1 = 5.27 AU/yr \n\nSo a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π ) \n\nFor system 2, P = 1 year. \n\na = 5.27 AU/yr * 1 yr / (2 π ) ≈ 5.27 / 6.283 ≈ 0.839 AU \n\nThen, M_total = a³ / P² = (0.839)^3 / (1)^2 ≈ 0.590 solar masses. \n\nSo system 1 has ~0.256 solar masses, system 2 has ~0.590 solar masses. \n\nTherefore, the ratio M1 / M2 ≈ 0.256 / 0.590 ≈ 0.434, which is approximately 0.43, which rounds to 0.4, so answer D. \n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.4. The question asks \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" Since the factor is less than 1, it means system_1 is less massive, but the answer options include 0.4 as D. So the answer is D. \n\nBut just to make sure there's no other approach where the answer might be different. For example, if someone forgot to cube the velocity sum, but I don't think so. The formula does require cubing because the mass depends on a³, and a is proportional to velocity times period. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the mass ratio from individual stars? For system_1, we found M1 = 0.256 solar masses. For system_2, let's check the mass ratio. \n\nFor system_2: K1 = 15 km/s, K2 = 10 km/s. So K1/K2 = 15/10 = 1.5 = m2/m1. So m2 = 1.5 m1. Total mass M2 = m1 + m2 = 2.5 m1. \n\nUsing Kepler's law, we found M2 ≈ 0.590 solar masses. Let's check if this is consistent. \n\nFrom the total mass formula, M_total = 0.590 solar masses = 2.5 m1 => m1 ≈ 0.590 / 2.5 ≈ 0.236 solar masses. \n\nBut maybe this isn't necessary. The main point is that the ratio between M1 and M2 is ~0.43, so answer D. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: ~0.4.\n</think>"}
