The matrix M is defined by how it transforms two specific vectors: it takes the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and the vector (1, -3) to (7, -1). \n\nFirst, I remember that a matrix transformation is linear, so if I can figure out what the matrix M is, then I can apply it to any vector on the line y = 2x + 1. But to find the matrix M, I need to use the information given about how it transforms those two vectors. \n\nSince we're dealing with 2x2 matrices, and we have two vectors and their images, we can set up equations to solve for the entries of M. Let me recall that a matrix M = [[a, b], [c, d]] when multiplied by a vector [x, y] gives [ax + by, cx + dy]. \n\nSo, applying M to the first vector (2, -1) gives:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9  \nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to the second vector (1, -3) gives:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7  \nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9  \n2) 2c - d = 3  \n3) a - 3b = 7  \n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve these equations for a, b, c, d. Let me start with equations 1 and 3 for a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9  \nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for b: b = 2a - 9\n\nThen substitute into equation 3:\n\na - 3*(2a - 9) = 7  \na - 6a + 27 = 7  \n-5a + 27 = 7  \n-5a = 7 - 27  \n-5a = -20  \na = 4\n\nThen substitute a = 4 into b = 2a - 9:  \nb = 2*4 - 9 = 8 - 9 = -1\n\nSo a = 4, b = -1. Now let me check equations 2 and 4 for c and d.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2c - d = 3  \nFrom equation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for d: d = 2c - 3\n\nSubstitute into equation 4:\n\nc - 3*(2c - 3) = -1  \nc - 6c + 9 = -1  \n-5c + 9 = -1  \n-5c = -10  \nc = 2\n\nThen substitute c = 2 into d = 2c - 3:  \nd = 2*2 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo c = 2, d = 1. Therefore, the matrix M is:\n\n[4, -1]  \n[2, 1]\n\nLet me verify these values with the original transformations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, applying M to (2, -1):\n\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1) = 8 + 1 = 9 ✔️  \n2*2 + 1*(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 ✔️\n\nApplying M to (1, -3):\n\n4*1 + (-1)*(-3) = 4 + 3 = 7 ✔️  \n2*1 + 1*(-3) = 2 - 3 = -1 ✔️\n\nPerfect, the matrix is correct.\n\nNow, moving on to finding the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how linear transformations affect lines. Since a line can be represented parametrically or in terms of points, perhaps I can take two points on the line, apply the transformation, and then find the equation of the new line through the transformed points. Alternatively, since the transformation is linear, maybe I can find the transformation of the general point on the line. Let me think.\n\nBut first, note that linear transformations map lines to lines (or to a point if the line is in the null space, but since M is invertible here, probably maps to a line). So if I can find two points on the original line, apply M to them, and then find the equation of the line through the transformed points, that should work.\n\nAlternatively, since the transformation is linear, maybe I can find the image of the line by considering how M acts on vectors. Let me try both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: pick two points on y = 2x + 1, transform them, then find the equation.\n\nLet me pick two points. Let's take x=0: y=1, so point A is (0,1). Then another point, say x=1: y=3, so point B is (1,3). Let me transform these points with M.\n\nBut wait, need to be careful here. The matrix M operates on vectors, but when we talk about points, we need to remember that linear transformations fix the origin. However, lines not passing through the origin will be transformed in a way that depends on their position. However, since we have a matrix transformation (which is linear), it's actually a linear transformation, not an affine transformation. Therefore, to properly transform the entire line, we might need to consider it as a set of points, but since linear transformations don't account for translation, if the original line doesn't pass through the origin, the image will be a line passing through the origin? Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Wait, if we have a line not passing through the origin, and we apply a linear transformation, the image will be a line passing through the image of the origin. But since linear transformations satisfy M(0) = 0, so the image of the origin is the origin. Therefore, if we transform a line not passing through the origin, the image will be a line passing through the origin. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose we have a line y = 2x + 1. Let me take two points on it, say (0,1) and (1,3). Let me apply M to these two points.\n\nFirst, applying M to (0,1):\n\n[4, -1] [0]   = 4*0 + (-1)*1 = -1  \n[2, 1] [1]      2*0 + 1*1 = 1\n\nSo transformed point A' is (-1, 1).\n\nApplying M to (1,3):\n\n[4, -1] [1]   = 4*1 + (-1)*3 = 4 - 3 = 1  \n[2, 1] [3]      2*1 + 1*3 = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nTransformed point B' is (1, 5).\n\nNow, if I find the line through (-1, 1) and (1, 5), what is its equation?\n\nFirst, compute the slope m:\n\nm = (5 - 1)/(1 - (-1)) = 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nSo the slope is 2. Then using point-slope form with point (-1, 1):\n\ny - 1 = 2(x - (-1))  \ny - 1 = 2(x + 1)  \ny = 2x + 2 + 1  \ny = 2x + 3\n\nWait, but if the transformation is linear, shouldn't the image pass through the origin? But according to this, the transformed line is y = 2x + 3, which does not pass through the origin. That seems contradictory. What did I do wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe my mistake is in thinking that linear transformations map lines through the origin to lines through the origin, but lines not through the origin are mapped to lines not through the origin? Wait, no. Wait, linear transformations must map the origin to itself. Therefore, if you have a line that does not pass through the origin, its image under a linear transformation will be a line that does pass through the image of the origin, which is the origin. Therefore, the image should be a line through the origin. But according to my calculation, the transformed line is y = 2x + 3, which does not pass through the origin. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check my transformed points again. Let me recalculate M*(0,1):\n\nOriginal matrix M is:\n\n[4, -1]  \n[2, 1]\n\nSo multiplying by vector (0, 1):\n\nFirst component: 4*0 + (-1)*1 = -1  \nSecond component: 2*0 + 1*1 = 1  \nSo (-1, 1). Correct.\n\nMultiplying by (1, 3):\n\nFirst component: 4*1 + (-1)*3 = 4 - 3 = 1  \nSecond component: 2*1 + 1*3 = 2 + 3 = 5  \nSo (1, 5). Correct.\n\nSo the line through (-1, 1) and (1, 5) is y = 2x + 3. But this line does not pass through the origin. However, since M is a linear transformation, the image of the origin (which is (0,0)) should be (0,0). But (0,0) is not on y = 2x + 3. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, but why? Maybe because when I take two points on the original line and transform them, the image is not just those two points, but the entire line. However, if the original line does not pass through the origin, then the image under a linear transformation is not a line through the origin? But linear transformations are supposed to preserve linear subspaces. A line not passing through the origin is not a subspace, it's an affine subspace. Therefore, the image of an affine subspace under a linear transformation is another affine subspace. However, if I want to find the image of the line, which is an affine subspace, I need to consider that the transformation is linear. Therefore, perhaps my mistake was in assuming that I can just take two points and find the line between them. However, since the original line is affine, perhaps I need to represent it in terms of a point and a direction vector, and then apply the transformation accordingly.\n\nLet me recall that any line can be written as a point plus a direction vector times a parameter. For the line y = 2x + 1, we can write parametric equations. Let me do that.\n\nLet me parametrize the line. Let x = t, then y = 2t + 1. So parametric equations:\n\nx = t  \ny = 2t + 1\n\nSo any point on the line can be written as (t, 2t + 1) = t*(1, 2) + (0, 1). Therefore, this is the point (0,1) plus t times direction vector (1, 2). \n\nTherefore, applying the linear transformation M to this line would transform the point (0,1) to M*(0,1) and the direction vector (1,2) to M*(1,2). Therefore, the image of the line is the set { M*(0,1) + t*M*(1,2) | t ∈ R }, which is a line with direction vector M*(1,2) and passing through M*(0,1). \n\nTherefore, if I compute M*(0,1) and M*(1,2), then I can write the equation of the line.\n\nEarlier, I computed M*(0,1) = (-1, 1). Let me compute M*(1,2):\n\n[4, -1] [1] = 4*1 + (-1)*2 = 4 - 2 = 2  \n[2, 1] [2]     2*1 + 1*2 = 2 + 2 = 4  \nSo the direction vector is (2, 4). \n\nTherefore, the transformed line is parametrized as:\n\n(x, y) = (-1, 1) + t*(2, 4)\n\nSo to write this in standard form, let's eliminate the parameter t.\n\nFrom the parametric equations:\n\nx = -1 + 2t  \ny = 1 + 4t\n\nSolve for t from the first equation:\n\nt = (x + 1)/2\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\ny = 1 + 4*( (x + 1)/2 ) = 1 + 2*(x + 1) = 1 + 2x + 2 = 2x + 3\n\nSo the equation is y = 2x + 3, which is what I found earlier. But why does this line not pass through the origin? Because the original line didn't pass through the origin, and we translated it by the image of the point (0,1). However, since the transformation is linear, shouldn't the origin be mapped to itself? Let me check where (0,0) is mapped.\n\nM*(0,0) = (0,0). Correct. But our transformed line is y = 2x + 3, which does not pass through (0,0). Therefore, how come?\n\nAh! Because the original line does not pass through the origin, so when we apply the linear transformation, we get a line that does not pass through the origin. The image of the origin is still the origin, but the image of the original line is another line, which does not necessarily pass through the origin. The key is that the original line is not a subspace, so its image is not a subspace either. Therefore, the image is an affine line, which is fine. Therefore, my calculation is correct, and the image is y = 2x + 3. \n\nBut let me verify with another point to be sure. Let me take another point on the original line. Let me take x = -1, then y = 2*(-1) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1. So the point (-1, -1). Let me apply M to it:\n\n[4, -1] [-1] = 4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = -4 + 1 = -3  \n[2, 1] [-1]     2*(-1) + 1*(-1) = -2 -1 = -3  \nSo transformed point is (-3, -3). \n\nNow, check if (-3, -3) lies on y = 2x + 3:\n\nLeft-hand side y = -3  \nRight-hand side: 2*(-3) + 3 = -6 + 3 = -3 ✔️\n\nGood. Let me check another point. Take x = 0.5, then y = 2*(0.5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. So original point (0.5, 2). Apply M:\n\n[4, -1] [0.5] = 4*0.5 + (-1)*2 = 2 - 2 = 0  \n[2, 1] [2]       2*0.5 + 1*2 = 1 + 2 = 3  \nTransformed point (0, 3). Check if this is on y = 2x + 3: 2*0 + 3 = 3 ✔️. Correct.\n\nTherefore, seems like y = 2x + 3 is indeed the correct image. However, let me think again about why the line does not pass through the origin. The original line didn't pass through the origin. The transformation maps the origin to itself, but the rest of the line is transformed accordingly. Therefore, the image line is shifted because of the translation component introduced by the image of the point (0,1). Since (0,1) is not the origin, its image is (-1,1), which causes the image line to be shifted. Therefore, the result is an affine line, not passing through the origin. \n\nAlternatively, if I had taken two points on the original line and computed their images, and then found the line through those two images, that should also work. Which I did, and got the same result. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by using the matrix M to transform the equation of the line directly. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe original line is y = 2x + 1. Let me represent a general point (x, y) on this line. Then, applying the transformation M, which is a linear transformation, will take (x, y) to (X, Y) where:\n\nX = 4x - y  \nY = 2x + y\n\nBecause the matrix M is [[4, -1], [2, 1]], so multiplying by (x, y) gives X = 4x - y, Y = 2x + y.\n\nBut since (x, y) is on the line y = 2x + 1, we can substitute y = 2x + 1 into the equations for X and Y.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nX = 4x - (2x + 1) = 4x - 2x - 1 = 2x - 1  \nY = 2x + (2x + 1) = 4x + 1\n\nNow, I need to eliminate x from these equations to find the relationship between X and Y.\n\nFrom X = 2x - 1, solve for x:\n\nx = (X + 1)/2\n\nSubstitute into Y:\n\nY = 4*( (X + 1)/2 ) + 1 = 2*(X + 1) + 1 = 2X + 2 + 1 = 2X + 3\n\nTherefore, Y = 2X + 3. Therefore, in terms of the original variables (since X and Y are the coordinates after transformation), the equation is y = 2x + 3. \n\nThis matches the previous result! Therefore, this confirms that the image of the line under M is y = 2x + 3. \n\nTherefore, despite my confusion about the origin, the answer is correct. The key was realizing that even though the transformation is linear, the line being transformed is affine (not passing through the origin), so its image is another affine line, which can be found by either transforming points and direction vectors or by substituting the line equation into the transformation.\n\nJust to recap:\n\nOriginal line: y = 2x + 1  \nAfter transformation: y = 2x + 3\n\nTherefore, the answer is y = 2x + 3.\n\nBut let me check once more with another method. Maybe using the inverse transformation or something else. Wait, perhaps I can check if the direction vector is transformed properly.\n\nOriginal direction vector of the line y = 2x + 1 is (1, 2). Applying M to this direction vector:\n\n[4, -1] [1] = 4*1 -1*2 = 4 - 2 = 2  \n[2, 1] [2]     2*1 + 1*2 = 2 + 2 = 4  \nSo direction vector (2, 4), which simplifies to (1, 2) if we divide by 2. Therefore, the slope of the transformed line is 2/1 = 2, which matches the slope we found earlier. Therefore, the slope of the image line is 2. Then, since we know it passes through (-1, 1), we can write the equation as y - 1 = 2(x + 1), which simplifies to y = 2x + 3. Yep, same result. \n\nTherefore, all methods converge to the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under the matrix M is y = 2x + 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe image of the line under the matrix transformation is \\boxed{y = 2x + 3}.\n</think>"}
