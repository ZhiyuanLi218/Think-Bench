Since both gases are at the **same temperature**, their **average kinetic energy per molecule is the same**, regardless of their mass. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.**\n\nThe **force** exerted on the container walls is related to the **pressure** of the gas. Pressure is defined as force per unit area:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{F}{A}\n$$\n\nFor the force to be greater, the pressure would need to be greater. However, the pressure of an ideal gas is given by:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{nRT}{V}\n$$\n\nWe are not told how the containers were \"filled\"—whether with the same number of moles, the same pressure, or some other condition. Since the number of moles $n$ is not specified, we **cannot conclude** whether the force (or pressure) is greater for hydrogen. **Option B cannot be confirmed and is therefore incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.**\n\nThe **density** of a gas is given by:\n\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{m}{V} = \\frac{nM}{V}\n$$\n\nWhere $M$ is the molar mass. Assuming that both gases are at the **same pressure and temperature**, and the **volumes are the same**, then from the ideal gas law $PV = nRT$, the number of moles $n$ will also be the same. This is a **standard assumption** in problems where gases are compared in identical containers at the same temperature and pressure.\n\nGiven that the molar mass of hydrogen (2 g/mol) is much less than that of nitrogen (28 g/mol), and assuming the number of moles is the same, the **density of hydrogen will be less** than that of nitrogen.\n\nThus, **Option C is correct** under the standard assumption that the gases are at the same pressure and temperature, which is consistent with the context of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.**\n\nThis statement is **partially true** in a general sense. Without knowing the number of moles $n$, we cannot determine the pressure of the gas using the ideal gas law. However, the question is asking about a comparison of **properties** after the containers are filled and brought to thermal equilibrium. In such a standard physics problem, unless stated otherwise, it is **reasonable to assume** that the containers are filled to the **same pressure**, since they are identical and in the same environment.\n\nTherefore, **Option D is not the best answer**, because the question allows for a valid comparison under a standard assumption.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that is **definitely correct** under the standard assumptions of ideal gas behavior and identical conditions (same volume, same temperature, and same pressure) is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there are two identical containers filled with different gases: hydrogen in one and nitrogen in the other. Both are allowed to come to thermal equilibrium with the room. The question is asking which of the given options correctly compares their properties.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic gas laws and concepts. Since they are in thermal equilibrium with the room, their temperatures should be the same as the room temperature. That means both gases have the same temperature. \n\nNow, the containers are identical, so their volumes are the same. But the gases are different: hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2). The molar masses are different. Hydrogen is much lighter; H2 has a molar mass of about 2 g/mol, while N2 is around 28 g/mol. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\n\nHmm. I remember that the average kinetic energy of gas particles depends only on temperature. The formula for average kinetic energy is (3/2)kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. Since both gases are at the same temperature, their average kinetic energies per molecule should be the same. So option A is incorrect because it says hydrogen's average kinetic energy is greater. Wait, but kinetic energy is also related to mass and velocity squared. So even though hydrogen is lighter, they move faster to have the same kinetic energy? Yeah, that's right. So A is false. \n\nB: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\n\nForce on the container... Well, pressure is force per area. If the pressure is the same, then the force would be the same since the containers are identical. But are the pressures the same? Let's think. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. If the containers are identical (same volume V), same temperature T, but different gases. However, the problem doesn't mention the number of moles (n) in each container. Wait, but the containers are \"filled\" with the gases. Does that mean they are filled to the same pressure? Or same number of moles? The question isn't explicit. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"Each container is set on a lab table and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium with the room.\" So they are at the same temperature. But the initial filling might have different pressures. But the question is about the properties after they are in equilibrium. However, the problem doesn't specify whether they are filled to the same pressure or same amount. Wait, the problem states they are \"filled\" but doesn't say how. So maybe we need to assume something? Wait, maybe the key is that they are identical containers and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium. But without knowing the number of molecules, we can't directly compare pressure? Wait, but if they are filled with different gases, maybe they have the same pressure? Or not? Hmm. \n\nWait, the problem says \"filled with different gases\". If the containers are filled, perhaps implying that they are filled to the same pressure? Like, when you fill a container with a gas, you might fill it to a certain pressure. But the problem doesn't specify. So maybe we need to assume that the number of moles is different? For example, if the containers are filled to the same pressure and temperature, then n would be the same for both gases (since PV=nRT, same P, V, T implies same n). But if they are filled with different gases, maybe they have the same pressure? But the problem doesn't say. Wait, maybe the key is that they are allowed to come to thermal equilibrium with the room. So their temperatures are the same. But the pressure depends on n, which is not given. So maybe the answer is D? Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D says \"The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.\" That might be correct if we don't know n. But wait, the problem says the containers are filled with different gases. How are they filled? If they are filled to the same volume, same temperature, but different gases, unless they are filled to the same pressure, which would require different number of moles because their molar masses are different. Wait, but if you fill a container with a gas, you could fill it with a certain amount of moles. But unless specified, we can't assume anything about the number of moles. So perhaps the pressure can't be compared without knowing n? But the problem says they are \"filled\", so maybe they are filled to the same pressure? For example, if you fill a container with gas until it reaches atmospheric pressure. But that's an assumption. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe D is correct. However, let's check other options first.\n\nOption C: The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.\n\nDensity is mass per volume. Since the containers are the same volume, the one with more mass will have higher density. The mass depends on the number of moles times molar mass. So if both containers have the same number of moles, then the one with higher molar mass (N2) would have higher density. But if the number of moles is different... For example, if they are at the same pressure and temperature, then n = PV/RT. Since P, V, T are same, n would be same. Then density would be (n * molar mass)/V. Since molar mass of N2 is higher, density is higher. So in that case, C would be correct. But if the number of moles is different, then density could vary. But again, the problem doesn't specify how they are filled. Wait, but maybe we can assume that they are filled to the same pressure? Because otherwise, there's no way to answer the question. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. \n\nWait, the problem states that the containers are \"filled with different gases\". In a typical lab scenario, when you fill a container with a gas, you might fill it to a certain pressure, say atmospheric pressure. So if both containers are filled to the same pressure (say, room pressure) and same temperature, then using PV = nRT, since P, V, T are same, n is same. Then density would be mass/volume = (n * molar mass)/V. Since molar mass of N2 is higher, density of N2 is higher. Therefore, C is correct. But if they are not filled to the same pressure, then maybe not. But the problem doesn't specify. However, given that the containers are identical and set on the same lab table, perhaps they are at the same pressure? For example, if they are open containers? Wait, no, the problem says they are \"filled\", so probably sealed containers. But how they were filled isn't specified. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me think again. The question is about which of the options correctly compares the properties. Let's consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Average kinetic energy. As discussed, since temperature is same, average kinetic energy per molecule is same. So A is false.\n\nOption B: Average force on container. If pressure is same, then force on the container walls would be same (since pressure is force per area, and containers are identical). If pressure is different, then force would be different. But again, without knowing pressure, can't say. However, if they are filled to same pressure, then B is false. If not, maybe B is true? But again, the problem doesn't specify. So maybe B is not necessarily correct.\n\nOption C: Density. If they have same number of moles, then density is proportional to molar mass. Since H2 has lower molar mass, density is lower. So C is correct. But again, only if n is same. If they are filled to same pressure and temp, then n is same. If not, maybe not. But given that the problem states they are filled with gases and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium, maybe it's implied that they are at same pressure? Because otherwise, you can't determine. Since the question is from an exam, probably expects us to assume that pressure is same. Hence, C is correct.\n\nOption D: Pressures cannot be compared without knowing number of molecules. If the problem didn't specify how the containers were filled, then yes, you can't compare pressure. But if they are filled in a way that pressure is same, then D is wrong. However, the problem doesn't say they are filled to same pressure. So maybe D is correct. Wait, but the question is about properties after they are in thermal equilibrium. The filling process is not described. So if the containers are just set on the table, maybe they are at same temperature but different pressures? For example, if one container was filled with more gas, it would have higher pressure. Since the problem doesn't specify, we can't assume they have same pressure. Therefore, D is correct. But then, how about option C? If we can't compare pressures, can we compare densities? Because density depends on n and molar mass. If we don't know n, can we compare densities? For example, if container 1 has n1 moles of H2 and container 2 has n2 moles of N2, then density of H2 is (n1 * 2 g/mol)/V and N2 is (n2 * 28 g/mol)/V. Without knowing n1 and n2, can we compare? Unless there's some other info. But the problem doesn't say anything about the amount of gas. So maybe we can't compare densities either? Then C would be incorrect. But then, how can we answer?\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the containers are \"filled\". If they are filled to the same volume and same pressure and same temperature, then n is same. But if they are filled with different gases, maybe they are filled to the same pressure? Like, if you fill them from a gas cylinder at the same pressure. But this is an assumption. In real life, when you fill a container with gas, you can fill it to a certain pressure. But the problem doesn't specify. So in an exam question like this, usually, when they say containers are filled with gas and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium, they usually assume that they are at the same pressure and temperature. But maybe not. Wait, no. If you fill a container with gas, you could have different pressures. For example, if you have two containers of same volume, one filled with H2 and one with N2, but not necessarily same pressure. So unless told otherwise, you can't assume same pressure. Therefore, without knowing n, you can't compare pressure, density, etc. So options B and C would depend on n, which is unknown. So then D would be correct: pressures cannot be compared without knowing number of molecules. But then, what about option C? If you don't know n, can you compare densities? Let's think. Suppose container 1 has n1 moles of H2, container 2 has n2 moles of N2. Then density1 = (n1 * 2 g/mol)/V and density2 = (n2 * 28 g/mol)/V. To compare density1 and density2, you need to know the ratio n1/n2. If n1 and n2 are same, then density1 < density2. But if n1 is much larger than n2, maybe density1 could be larger. Since the problem doesn't specify, we can't say for sure. Therefore, option C is not necessarily correct. Therefore, the correct answer would be D? But wait, the problem says \"filled with different gases\". Maybe \"filled\" implies that they are filled to the same pressure? For example, if you fill a container with gas until it's full, meaning until it reaches a certain volume, but since the containers are rigid, maybe filled to the same pressure? Not sure. This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the concept that at same temperature, the lighter gas (H2) has higher rms speed, but same average kinetic energy. But that relates to A, which we already said is false. \n\nWait, let's think again. If the containers are identical and filled with different gases, but no info on pressure or amount. However, in a typical lab setting, when you fill a container with gas, you might fill it to a certain pressure. For example, if you have a gas cylinder and you fill the container until it reaches a certain pressure. So if both containers are filled to the same pressure, then PV = nRT. Since P, V, T are same, n is same. Then, as discussed, density of H2 is less than N2 because molar mass is less. Therefore, option C is correct. \n\nBut if they are not filled to same pressure, then C might not be correct. But the problem doesn't specify. However, in most textbook problems, when comparing gases in containers of same volume and temperature, and asking about properties, they usually assume same pressure unless stated otherwise. Therefore, maybe we are to assume same pressure. Hence, option C is correct. Then D is incorrect because pressure can be compared if we assume same pressure. But the problem doesn't state that. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the containers are filled with the same number of moles? If they are filled with same number of moles, then at same temperature and volume, pressure would be same (PV = nRT). Then again, same as before. So if the problem is from a textbook chapter that assumes same number of moles, then C is correct. But the problem doesn't specify. \n\nThis is really ambiguous. However, looking at the options, D says pressures cannot be compared without knowing number of molecules. But if the problem is from a chapter that assumes ideal gas law with same P, V, T, then n is same. But since the problem doesn't say, maybe D is correct. \n\nBut wait, in the real world, when you fill a container with a gas, you have to specify either pressure or amount. Since the problem says they are \"filled\", maybe it implies that they are filled to the same pressure. Otherwise, the problem would have to specify the amount. Therefore, in the absence of specific information, but given that they are \"filled\" and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium, it's reasonable to assume that they are at the same pressure and temperature. Hence, same n (since PV=nRT), and thus density of H2 is less than N2. So option C is correct. \n\nBut I'm still not 100% sure. Let's check another angle. If the containers are identical and filled with different gases, and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium with the room, then their temperatures are same as room temp. But the pressures could be different if they have different number of moles. However, if they were filled in a way that they have same pressure, then yes. But the problem doesn't say. However, in most standard problems, when comparing gases in containers of same volume and temperature, and no mention of pressure or moles, they usually assume same pressure. For example, in gas law problems, if you have two containers at same temp and volume, and you're comparing something, they often assume same pressure. So maybe in this case, we are to assume same pressure, leading to same n, hence C is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
