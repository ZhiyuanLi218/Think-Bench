Hmm, I remember that concave mirrors can form real or virtual images depending on the object's position. Let me recall the rules for image formation in concave mirrors.\n\nFirst, when the object is very far away (at infinity), the image is formed at the focal point, right? And it's a real, inverted, and diminished image. So the image is small and located at the focal point. Now, as the object moves closer to the mirror but still beyond the center of curvature (C), the image is between the center of curvature and the focal point. It's still real, inverted, and smaller than the object. Wait, no, maybe when it's at C, the image is same size. Let me get this straight.\n\nThe center of curvature (C) is at twice the focal length (2f). So when the object is at C, the image is also at C, same size, inverted. If the object is between C and F (the focal point), the image is beyond C, larger, and still real and inverted. When the object is at F, the image is at infinity, so it's not formed. And if the object is between F and the mirror, the image becomes virtual, upright, and magnified.\n\nSo the question is about moving the object from far away (infinity) towards the focal point. Let's track the image's position and size.\n\nStarting at infinity: image at F, small. As the object moves closer (say from infinity to C), the image moves from F to C. So the image is moving away from the mirror as the object approaches from infinity to C. Wait, if the object moves from infinity to C, the image moves from F to C. Since F is closer to the mirror than C, the image is moving away from the mirror. Also, the size of the image increases from a point (infinitesimally small) to the same size as the object when the object is at C.\n\nThen, as the object moves from C to F, the image moves from C to beyond C (towards infinity). So the image is moving away from the mirror even more. The size increases from same size to magnified.\n\nSo overall, as the object moves from far away to near the focal point (from infinity to F), the image moves away from the mirror (from F to beyond C) and the image gets taller (from small to magnified). So the correct answer would be B: The image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nWait, let me check again. When the object is at infinity, image is at F, very small. As object moves closer, image moves away from F towards C, getting larger until object is at C. Then, when object moves between C and F, image moves beyond C, getting even larger. So yes, image is moving away from the mirror and getting taller. So answer B. The other options: A says gets shorter, which is wrong. C says moves toward the mirror, which is wrong. D says moves toward and gets taller, no. So B is correct.\n</think>"}
