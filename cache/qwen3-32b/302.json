Structure of the Starting Material**\n\nThe compound **1-bromobenzene-2-d** is a benzene ring where:\n- A **bromine (Br)** is located at **position 1**.\n- A **deuterium (D)** is located at **position 2**.\n- All other positions are assumed to be normal hydrogen (H).\n\nThis labeling is critical because it allows us to distinguish between different reaction pathways that would otherwise give identical products in the absence of deuterium.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Reaction Conditions and Mechanism**\n\nThe reagent used is **sodium amide (NaNH₂)** in **liquid ammonia**, which is a **very strong base**. Under these conditions, **bromobenzene** can undergo a **dehydrohalogenation** to form a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\nThe mechanism involves:\n- **Deprotonation** of a hydrogen (or deuterium) from a position **adjacent to the bromine**.\n- **Elimination of HBr (or DBr)** to form a **benzyne intermediate**, a highly reactive species with a **triple bond** between two adjacent carbons in the ring.\n- The **benzyne** can then react with a **nucleophile**, such as **NH₂⁻** (from NaNH₂), to form an **aniline derivative**.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A:2, B:3, C:4, D:1. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should recall what 1-bromobenzene-2-d is. The \"-2-d\" part probably refers to the deuterium isotope at the 2-position. So the structure is bromobenzene where the bromine is at position 1 and the carbon at position 2 has a deuterium instead of hydrogen. So the molecule is a benzene ring with Br at C1 and D at C2. \n\nNow, the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. Sodium amide is a strong base, and ammonia as a solvent. I remember that NaNH2 in ammonia is used for deprotonation reactions, like in the Birch reduction, but maybe here it's a different reaction. Wait, but bromobenzene with a strong base... Hmm, maybe an elimination reaction? But elimination would require adjacent hydrogen atoms. However, bromobenzene typically doesn't undergo elimination easily because the benzene ring isn't a good leaving group. Wait, but sodium amide is a very strong base. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution? But aryl halides don't usually undergo nucleophilic substitution via SN1 or SN2 mechanisms because the carbon is sp² hybridized and the leaving group is on a benzene ring. Unless there's some other pathway.\n\nWait, maybe this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction? But dehydrohalogenation usually requires adjacent hydrogens. Let me think. If we have 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the Br is at position 1, and the D is at position 2. So, the positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has a deuterium, and position 6 has a hydrogen (assuming the deuterium is only at position 2). If we use a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps we can abstract a proton (or deuterium) from position 2 to form a double bond between C1 and C2, eliminating HBr? But wait, elimination usually forms an alkene. However, in this case, if we eliminate Br and a proton from adjacent positions, we would form a benzene ring with a double bond? But benzene already has conjugated double bonds. Wait, maybe it's forming a benzyne intermediate?\n\nAh, yes! Aryl halides can undergo elimination reactions under very strong base conditions to form benzyne intermediates. For example, when bromobenzene is treated with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia, it can form benzyne. The mechanism involves deprotonation of a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, followed by elimination of HBr, generating a highly reactive benzyne intermediate. However, benzyne is a very strained and reactive species, and it can undergo further reactions.\n\nBut in this case, the starting material has a deuterium at position 2. Let me draw this out mentally. The structure is:\n\nBromine at position 1, deuterium at position 2. So, positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), and adjacent to Br are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, and position 6 has H (assuming the rest are hydrogens unless specified otherwise). \n\nIf the base abstracts the deuterium from position 2, then elimination would occur between positions 1 and 2, forming a double bond between 1 and 2 and eliminating HBr. But wait, the base would need to abstract a proton (or deuterium) from the beta position. In this case, the beta positions are 2 and 6. Since position 2 has D and position 6 has H, the base could abstract either. However, the deuterium is less acidic than a regular proton, so maybe the abstraction is slower? But in the presence of a very strong base like NaNH2, maybe both are possible?\n\nBut if the base can abstract either the D at position 2 or the H at position 6, then two different elimination pathways are possible. However, the question is about possible organic products. Let me think about what happens after elimination. \n\nIf elimination occurs from position 2 (D), then we form a double bond between 1 and 2. The benzyne intermediate would be formed. Similarly, if elimination occurs from position 6 (H), we form a double bond between 1 and 6, but since the ring is symmetric, maybe that's equivalent to another position? Wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are symmetric. If you eliminate from position 6 (which is opposite to position 1?), no, position 1 and 6 are adjacent? Wait, in a benzene ring, positions are numbered consecutively. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. If we eliminate between 1 and 2, forming a double bond there. If we eliminate between 1 and 6, forming a double bond there. However, in a benzene ring, the double bonds are conjugated, so forming a specific double bond isn't really isolated. But benzyne is a triple bond? No, benzyne is a highly strained aromatic compound with a triple bond? Wait, no, benzyne is a dihydrobenzene with a triple bond? Or is it a dihydrobenzene with a double bond? Wait, no, benzyne is a compound with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons in the benzene ring. Wait, but benzene has three double bonds. If you remove two hydrogens from adjacent carbons and form a triple bond, that's benzyne. So, for example, if you eliminate HBr from bromobenzene, you get benzyne. \n\nBut in this case, the starting material has a deuterium at position 2. So if the base abstracts the deuterium at position 2, elimination would occur between 1 and 2, forming benzyne. Alternatively, if the base abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, elimination would occur between 1 and 6, forming another benzyne. However, are these two benzyne intermediates different? In reality, benzyne is a symmetrical molecule? No, depending on which two hydrogens are eliminated, but in this case, the starting material is not symmetrical because of the deuterium at position 2. \n\nWait, but once benzyne is formed, it's a highly reactive species. However, in the reaction conditions, if the benzyne is formed, what happens next? Typically, benzyne can react with nucleophiles. But in this reaction, the solvent is ammonia, and the base is NaNH2. So maybe the benzyne reacts with NH2^-? Wait, but the reaction is NaNH2 in ammonia. So perhaps the benzyne is quenched by the solvent or the amide ion. However, if the question is about the organic products, maybe the benzyne doesn't react further and just forms a product? Or maybe the benzyne is not the final product. Wait, but the question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in ammonia. If the reaction is elimination to form benzyne, but benzyne is unstable, perhaps the actual product is something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. \n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the deuterium is a label here. Since the question is about how many possible organic products, considering the deuterium position. Let me think again. If the elimination can occur from two different positions (position 2 and 6), leading to different benzyne intermediates. However, since the ring is symmetrical, eliminating from position 6 would be equivalent to eliminating from another position if there were no deuterium. But because there is a deuterium at position 2, eliminating from position 2 vs. 6 would lead to different products? \n\nWait, if benzyne is formed by elimination between C1 and C2, then the resulting benzyne would have a deuterium at position... Wait, no, when you eliminate the deuterium from position 2 and the bromine at position 1, you form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But in that case, where is the deuterium? The deuterium was at position 2, which is eliminated. Wait, no. Let me clarify the mechanism. \n\nThe mechanism for elimination to form benzyne would involve deprotonation of a beta hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine. For example, in bromobenzene, the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 or 6, leading to the formation of a double bond (or triple bond in the case of benzyne) between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6. \n\nBut in this case, the starting material has a deuterium at position 2. So, if the base abstracts the deuterium from position 2, elimination occurs between C1 and C2, forming benzyne. However, the deuterium is removed as a proton (or deuterium) during the elimination. Wait, no. The elimination would remove the deuterium from position 2 and the bromine from position 1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. However, the deuterium is not part of the leaving group; the leaving group is Br. The elimination would be H (or D) from position 2 and Br from position 1, forming a double bond between C1 and C2 and releasing HBr. Wait, but benzyne is formed by elimination of HBr, so the H comes from a beta position. \n\nSo, if the beta hydrogen is deuterated at position 2, then eliminating D from position 2 would form benzyne. Alternatively, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6 (which is normal H), then elimination would occur between C1 and C6, forming another benzyne. \n\nBut since the ring is symmetrical, eliminating from position 6 would give a benzyne that's equivalent to eliminating from position 2 if there were no deuterium. However, because there is a deuterium at position 2, the two elimination pathways might lead to different products. Wait, but after elimination, the deuterium is gone? No, the deuterium is at position 2. If we eliminate from position 2 (D), then we remove the D and form a double bond between C1 and C2. But the deuterium is part of the eliminated species? No, the elimination would involve removing a D from position 2 and the Br from position 1 to form a double bond between C1 and C2 and release HBr (but with D instead of H? Wait, no. The elimination is removing a D and a Br. Let me think of the mechanism step by step. \n\nThe base (NH2^-) abstracts the deuterium from position 2, forming a carbanion. Then, the bromide leaves, and the carbanion forms a double bond with the adjacent carbon (C1), resulting in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2 and the release of HBr (with the D from position 2). Wait, but the D is abstracted by the base as a D^-? No, the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) as a proton. The mechanism would be:\n\nBase abstracts a proton (or deuterium) from the beta position, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then loses the leaving group (Br^-), forming a double bond. \n\nBut in this case, the leaving group is Br, and the elimination is of HBr. However, since the H (or D) is from the beta position, the elimination would be E2 mechanism. \n\nSo if the beta position has D, then the eliminated HBr would have D instead of H? No, the elimination would be of HBr, but if the beta hydrogen is D, then the eliminated molecule would be DBr? Wait, no. The elimination is of HBr, but if the H is replaced by D, then it's DBr. However, in this case, the base abstracts the D from the beta position, so the eliminated molecule would be DBr instead of HBr. But the product would still be the same benzyne intermediate, just with a different byproduct (DBr vs. HBr). However, the organic product is the benzyne, which would be the same regardless of which beta hydrogen was eliminated? Or is there a difference?\n\nWait, no. If you eliminate from position 2 (with D), you form a benzyne where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. If you eliminate from position 6 (with H), you form a benzyne with triple bond between C1 and C6. Are these two benzyne isomers different? In reality, benzyne has two equivalent forms because of the aromaticity, but perhaps in this case, due to the deuterium label, they are different?\n\nWait, but the starting material has a deuterium at position 2. If elimination occurs from position 2, the deuterium is removed. If elimination occurs from position 6, the deuterium remains at position 2. Wait, no. The deuterium is at position 2. If elimination occurs from position 6, the deuterium at position 2 is still present. But the elimination from position 6 would form a benzyne between C1 and C6, leaving the deuterium at position 2. However, the benzyne would then be a different species. \n\nBut how does the deuterium affect the product? If the benzyne is formed and then reacts with something, but in this case, the reaction is just NaNH2 in ammonia. Maybe the benzyne doesn't react further and the product is the benzyne? But benzyne is too unstable. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Wait, another thought: maybe this is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S_NAr) reaction. But for that, the ring needs to have electron-withdrawing groups. Bromobenzene isn't typically reactive in S_NAr unless there are activating groups. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the NaNH2 is acting as a nucleophile. But again, aryl halides don't usually undergo S_NAr without activating groups. \n\nWait, going back. The key here is the deuterium. The question is about the number of possible organic products. If elimination can occur from two different positions (position 2 and 6), leading to different benzyne intermediates, but since benzyne is unstable, perhaps the actual products are different when they react with something. However, in the given reaction conditions, maybe the benzyne doesn't react further, or maybe it reacts with the amide ion or ammonia. \n\nAlternatively, maybe after forming benzyne, it could insert into another molecule or react with NH2^- to form a substituted product. But without more information, it's hard to say. However, the question is about the number of possible organic products in the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in ammonia. \n\nLet me think again. If the elimination can occur from two different positions (position 2 and 6), leading to two different benzyne intermediates. However, since the deuterium is at position 2, eliminating from position 2 would remove the deuterium, while eliminating from position 6 would leave the deuterium intact. But what is the final product? \n\nIf the benzyne is formed and then reacts with NH3 (the solvent), maybe it adds ammonia across the triple bond? For example, benzyne reacting with NH3 could form an aniline derivative. However, if the benzyne is formed between C1 and C2, adding NH2 group would give aniline with substitution. But since the starting material has a deuterium at position 2, if elimination occurs from position 2, then the deuterium is removed, and the product would be aniline with substitution at C1 and maybe some other positions. Whereas if elimination occurs from position 6, the deuterium at position 2 remains, and the product would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the benzyne intermediate is not the final product, and the actual product is a substitution product where the bromine is replaced. But how? \n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a substituted benzene. For example, eliminating HBr to form a double bond. But in benzene, forming a double bond would disrupt the aromaticity, making it less favorable. However, if the double bond is formed in a way that maintains aromaticity? No, aromaticity requires conjugated double bonds. If you have a double bond between C1 and C2, and the rest of the ring has the usual double bonds, it's still aromatic. Wait, but benzene already has that. So maybe the product is still benzene? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is forming a substituted benzene with a deuterium. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nThe starting material is 1-bromo-2-deuteriobenzene. The reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. Sodium amide is a very strong base. In such conditions, aryl halides can undergo elimination reactions to form benzyne intermediates. \n\nThe mechanism involves the base abstracting a proton (or deuterium) from a position adjacent to the bromine. In this case, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a deuterium, and position 6 has a hydrogen. \n\nIf the base abstracts the deuterium from position 2, then elimination of HBr (with D instead of H?) occurs, forming benzyne between C1 and C2. If the base abstracts the hydrogen from position 6, elimination occurs between C1 and C6, forming another benzyne. \n\nNow, benzyne is a reactive intermediate. In ammonia solvent, it might react with the solvent or with the amide ion. For example, the amide ion could attack the benzyne, leading to substitution. However, the exact product depends on the position of the benzyne. \n\nBut since the question is about the number of possible organic products, we need to consider how many different products can form from these elimination pathways. \n\nIf elimination occurs from position 2 (D), the benzyne formed is between C1 and C2. If it reacts with NH2^- (from NaNH2), it might form an aniline derivative. Similarly, elimination from position 6 would form benzyne between C1 and C6, which might also react with NH2^- to form another aniline derivative. However, due to the deuterium label at position 2, these products might be different. \n\nWait, let's think about the products after benzyne formation. \n\nCase 1: Elimination from position 2 (D). Benzyne between C1 and C2. If this reacts with NH2^-, the attack could occur at either end of the triple bond. For example, the amide ion could attack C1 or C2. However, since there's a triple bond between C1 and C2, attacking C1 would give a different product than attacking C2. But in reality, benzyne is symmetrical? No, benzyne has a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, so it's not symmetrical if there are substituents. However, in our case, the starting material has a deuterium at position 2. If elimination from position 2 forms benzyne between C1 and C2, then the deuterium was at position 2, but it was eliminated. Wait, no. If the deuterium is at position 2 and we eliminate it, then after elimination, there's no deuterium left at position 2. The benzyne would be between C1 and C2, and the rest of the ring would have hydrogens. If the amide ion attacks the benzyne, it would form a new carbon-nitrogen bond. Depending on where it attacks, the substitution pattern changes. \n\nAlternatively, if the benzyne is formed between C1 and C6, and there's still a deuterium at position 2, then attacking that benzyne would give a different product with the deuterium still present. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible products:\n\n1. If elimination occurs from position 2 (D), forming benzyne between C1 and C2. The benzyne then reacts with NH2^- to form an aniline derivative. Since the deuterium at position 2 was eliminated, the product would have an amino group attached to C1 or C2? Wait, if the benzyne is between C1 and C2, and the amide ion attacks, it could add to either C1 or C2. However, in reality, the attack is more likely to occur at the carbon adjacent to the triple bond where there's more electron density. But I'm not sure. Assuming it adds to C1, the product would be aniline with substitution at C1, but since the original bromine was at C1, maybe the amino group replaces the bromine? Wait, no. The original bromine is eliminated as Br^- along with the deuterium. \n\nActually, when benzyne is formed, the bromine is gone. The benzyne is a triple bond between two carbons. If the amide ion attacks, it would add to one end of the triple bond, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond. For example, if benzyne is between C1 and C2, and the amide ion attacks C1, the product would be a compound with an NH2 group at C1 and a hydrogen (or deuterium?) at C2. But wait, in this case, the deuterium at position 2 was eliminated, so position 2 would have a hydrogen now? Or was it part of the triple bond? \n\nThis is getting too detailed. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's consider that the elimination can occur in two different ways (from position 2 and 6), leading to two different benzyne intermediates. Each benzyne can react with the amide ion or ammonia to form different products. \n\nHowever, if the deuterium is only at position 2, then eliminating from position 2 would remove the deuterium, while eliminating from position 6 would leave the deuterium intact. Therefore, the products would differ based on whether the deuterium was eliminated or not. \n\nAssuming that the benzyne reacts with NH3 to form a substituted product, we could have two different products: one where the deuterium is gone (eliminated from position 2) and another where the deuterium remains (eliminated from position 6). However, there's also the possibility of different regiochemistry in the attack on the benzyne. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each elimination pathway leads to one product, and since there are two elimination pathways, there are two products. But considering the deuterium label, maybe there are more. \n\nWait, let's think about the possible organic products. \n\nIf elimination occurs from position 2 (D), the deuterium is removed, forming benzyne between C1 and C2. This benzyne then reacts with NH3 to form aniline (with substitution at C1 or C2). However, since the original bromine was at C1, maybe the substitution is at C1. But I'm not sure. \n\nIf elimination occurs from position 6 (H), the deuterium remains at position 2, and benzyne is formed between C1 and C6. This benzyne would react with NH3 to form another product, possibly with substitution at C1 or C6. \n\nBut since the question is about the number of possible organic products, considering the deuterium labeling, we need to account for different positions of substitution and the presence or absence of deuterium. \n\nLet me consider that each elimination pathway leads to one product, and each product may have different deuterium positions. \n\nCase 1: Elimination from position 2 (D). Product has no deuterium at position 2. The substitution product might be aniline with substitution at C1. \n\nCase 2: Elimination from position 6 (H). Product still has deuterium at position 2. The substitution product might be aniline with substitution at C1 or C6. \n\nBut if the substitution occurs at C1 in both cases, then the only difference is the presence of deuterium at position 2. However, if the substitution occurs at a different position, then there might be more products. \n\nAlternatively, if the benzyne formed from elimination at position 2 can be attacked at two different positions (C1 or C2), leading to two products, and similarly for the other benzyne. \n\nThis is getting too complex without a clear mechanism. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. \n\nIn the absence of deuterium (i.e., normal 1-bromobenzene), treatment with NaNH2 in ammonia would lead to elimination forming benzyne, which then reacts with NH3 to form aniline. However, since there are two possible elimination pathways (from positions 2 and 6), but the resulting products are the same due to symmetry. But in this case, the deuterium at position 2 breaks the symmetry. \n\nIf the deuterium is at position 2, eliminating from position 2 would remove the deuterium, leading to a product without deuterium at position 2. Eliminating from position 6 would leave the deuterium at position 2, leading to a product with deuterium still there. \n\nAssuming that the substitution product is aniline with the amino group at C1 (since the original bromine was at C1), then in one case, position 2 has no deuterium, and in the other, it still has deuterium. So two different products. \n\nHowever, there's also the possibility of the amino group being at a different position if the attack on benzyne occurs at the other end. For example, if the benzyne is between C1 and C2, and the attack occurs at C2, then the amino group would be at C2, and the original bromine at C1 is gone. But this would give a different product. \n\nSo for each elimination pathway, there might be two products (depending on where the nucleophile attacks the benzyne). \n\nIf elimination from position 2 leads to benzyne between C1 and C2, which can be attacked at C1 or C2, giving two products. Similarly, elimination from position 6 leads to benzyne between C1 and C6, which can be attacked at C1 or C6, giving two more products. \n\nBut with the deuterium label, some of these might be distinct. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Elimination from position 2 (D), forming benzyne between C1 and C2. Attack at C1: product is aniline with amino group at C1, no deuterium at position 2. Attack at C2: product is aniline with amino group at C2, no deuterium at position 2. \n\n2. Elimination from position 6 (H), forming benzyne between C1 and C6. Attack at C1: product is aniline with amino group at C1, deuterium still at position 2. Attack at C6: product is aniline with amino group at C6, deuterium at position 2. \n\nSo that's four possible products. However, some might be identical due to symmetry. For example, aniline with amino group at C1 and deuterium at position 2 is different from aniline with amino group at C1 and no deuterium at position 2. Similarly, aniline with amino group at C2 and no deuterium is different from others. \n\nBut wait, in the case of elimination from position 6 and attack at C6, the product would be aniline with amino group at C6 and deuterium at position 2. However, in the ring, position 6 is equivalent to position 2 in terms of symmetry? No, because position 2 has deuterium. So if the amino group is at C6 and deuterium at C2, it's a different compound than amino at C1 and deuterium at C2. \n\nTherefore, if all four possibilities are distinct, the answer would be 4. But I need to verify if these are indeed distinct. \n\nLet me consider the structures:\n\nProduct 1: Aniline with NH2 at C1, no D at C2. \n\nProduct 2: Aniline with NH2 at C2, no D at C2. Wait, no— if the attack is at C2, then the NH2 is at C2, and since the elimination was from position 2, the D was removed. So position 2 now has a hydrogen (since the D was eliminated). Wait, but the original position 2 had D, which was eliminated. So after elimination, position 2 has a hydrogen? Or is it part of the triple bond? \n\nActually, when you eliminate from position 2 (D), you form a triple bond between C1 and C2, and the D is removed. After the triple bond reacts with NH2^-, if the attack is at C1, then the product has NH2 at C1, and C2 would have a hydrogen (since the triple bond is broken). If the attack is at C2, then NH2 is at C2, and C1 would have a hydrogen. However, in the original molecule, the bromine was at C1. So after elimination, the bromine is gone, and the triple bond is between C1 and C2. \n\nThis is getting too detailed, but assuming that each attack leads to a different substitution pattern, we have four possible products. However, some might be identical. For example, if the amino group is at C2 and there's no D at C2, versus the amino group at C2 with D at C2, those are different. \n\nTherefore, if there are two elimination pathways, each leading to two products, that's four products. Hence, the answer would be C:4. \n\nBut wait, the options are A:2, B:3, C:4, D:1. \n\nHowever, I need to check if some of these products are actually the same. For example, if the amino group is at C1 and there's no D at C2, versus the amino group at C1 with D still at C2. These are two distinct products. Similarly, amino at C2 with no D and amino at C2 with D. So that's four products. \n\nBut another thought: maybe the attack on the benzyne is not regioselective, or maybe only one regioisomer is formed. For example, in the case of benzyne, the nucleophile usually attacks the carbon adjacent to the triple bond that is not directly opposite the leaving group. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack always occurs at the carbon that was originally the one with the leaving group. In this case, since the leaving group was at C1, the attack might occur at C2 (for the benzyne between C1 and C2), leading to substitution at C2. Similarly, for the benzyne between C1 and C6, the attack would occur at C6, leading to substitution at C6. \n\nIf that's the case, then elimination from position 2 would lead to substitution at C2 (with no D), and elimination from position 6 would lead to substitution at C6 (with D at position 2). Additionally, if there's another possibility where the attack occurs at C1, but that might not be favorable. \n\nAssuming only one regioisomer is formed per elimination pathway, then we have two products: one with substitution at C2 and no D, and one with substitution at C6 and D at C2. However, substitution at C6 is equivalent to substitution at C2 in terms of symmetry if there's no D. But since there is a D at C2 in one case, substitution at C6 is different from substitution at C2 with D at C2. \n\nWait, substitution at C6 would be a meta position relative to the original bromine at C1. Substitution at C2 is ortho. So they are different positions. Hence, two products. \n\nBut then why would there be more? Maybe there's also the possibility of substitution at C1? If the attack occurs at C1, then the product would have substitution at C1, but since the original bromine was at C1, that would mean replacing Br with NH2, but the elimination already removed Br. Wait, no. The elimination removed Br and a proton, forming the triple bond. The attack on the triple bond would add the NH2 group to one of the carbons involved in the triple bond. \n\nIf the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the attack occurs at C1, then the product has NH2 at C1, and the rest of the ring has hydrogens (except for position 2, which might have a hydrogen if the D was eliminated). \n\nBut in the original molecule, the bromine was at C1. After elimination, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the bromine is gone. If the attack occurs at C1, the NH2 group is added to C1, which was originally the bromine position. \n\nThis would be analogous to a nucleophilic substitution at C1. However, in the case of benzyne, the attack is addition to the triple bond, not substitution. \n\nThis is quite complex, but considering that the question is about the number of possible organic products, and given that there are two elimination pathways and potentially two attack positions per pathway, leading to four products, I think the answer might be C:4. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that maybe the deuterium doesn't affect the product count. For example, if the deuterium is just a label and doesn't lead to different products. But the question specifically mentions 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so the deuterium is part of the molecule and likely affects the product count. \n\nAnother angle: in the reaction, the deuterium is at position 2. If elimination occurs from position 2, the deuterium is removed, leading to a product without it. If elimination occurs from position 6, the deuterium remains. So two different products based on the presence of deuterium. But if each elimination pathway also leads to two products due to different substitution positions, that's four. \n\nBut maybe the substitution only occurs at one position, leading to two products. For example, if the nucleophile attacks the carbon that was originally the beta position, leading to substitution at that position. \n\nIf elimination from position 2 leads to substitution at position 2 (now without deuterium), and elimination from position 6 leads to substitution at position 6 (with deuterium at position 2), then two products. \n\nBut substitution at position 6 is equivalent to substitution at position 2 in a symmetrical ring, but since position 2 has deuterium, they are different. Hence, two products. \n\nWait, but substitution at position 6 would be a meta position relative to the original bromine at position 1. Substitution at position 2 is ortho. These are different positions, so two different products. \n\nTherefore, if each elimination pathway leads to one product, that's two products. Hence, answer A:2. \n\nBut earlier I thought there might be four. I'm confused now. \n\nLet me try to find a reference or example. In the case of bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2, treatment with NaNH2 in ammonia would lead to elimination. The possible elimination pathways are from position 2 (D) and position 6 (H). \n\nIf the elimination from position 2 gives a product with substitution at position 2 (without D), and elimination from position 6 gives substitution at position 6 (with D at position 2), then two products. \n\nAlternatively, if both eliminations lead to substitution at position 1, but with or without D, but substitution at position 1 would be the same position as the original bromine. \n\nBut I think the substitution occurs at the position adjacent to the triple bond. For example, if the triple bond is between C1 and C2, the nucleophile attacks C2, giving substitution at C2. Similarly, if the triple bond is between C1 and C6, the attack occurs at C6, giving substitution at C6. Hence, two products: substitution at C2 (no D) and substitution at C6 (with D at C2). \n\nSince these are two different positions (C2 and C6), they are distinct products. Hence, two products. Answer A:2. \n\nBut wait, substitution at C6 in a benzene ring with a deuterium at C2 is different from substitution at C2 with no deuterium. Yes, because the deuterium is at a specific position. Hence, two products. \n\nHowever, another possibility is that after elimination, the deuterium is still present, and the substitution occurs at a different position, leading to more products. \n\nBut I think the key here is that there are two possible elimination pathways, each leading to one product, hence two products. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Given the options, and considering that the deuterium is a label that distinguishes between products, I think the answer is either 2 or 4. \n\nIf there are two elimination pathways and each gives one product, then 2. If each pathway gives two products due to different substitution positions, then 4. \n\nIn the absence of specific knowledge about the regioselectivity of the attack on benzyne, I might lean towards two products, assuming that the substitution occurs at the position adjacent to the original triple bond. Hence, two products: one with substitution at C2 (no D) and one with substitution at C6 (with D at C2). \n\nTherefore, the answer is A:2. \n\nBut I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: in the absence of deuterium, the reaction would give one product (aniline), but with deuterium, it might give two products based on the elimination pathway. Hence, two products. \n\nYes, that makes sense. The deuterium allows distinguishing between the two elimination pathways, leading to two products. Hence, answer A:2.\n</think>"}
