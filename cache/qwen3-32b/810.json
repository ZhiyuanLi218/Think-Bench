The equation given is:\n\n$$ (3)5^2 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63 $$\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the equation correctly. There's a multiplication here, right? The first term is 3 times 5 squared. Then we subtract four times (5 minus a) squared divided by 3, and that equals 63. Let me write it down again to visualize better:\n\n$$ 3 \\times 5^2 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63 $$\n\nAlright, let's compute the first term. 5 squared is 25, and then multiplied by 3. So 3 times 25 is 75. So the equation becomes:\n\n$$ 75 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63 $$\n\nNow, I need to solve for 'a'. Let me isolate the term with 'a' in it. Let me subtract 75 from both sides first? Wait, actually, maybe I should move the fraction to the other side. Let me think.\n\nStarting with:\n\n$$ 75 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63 $$\n\nI can subtract 75 from both sides:\n\n$$ - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63 - 75 $$\n\nCalculating 63 - 75 gives me -12. So:\n\n$$ - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = -12 $$\n\nNow, if I multiply both sides by -1 to eliminate the negative signs:\n\n$$ \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 12 $$\n\nOkay, so now I have:\n\n$$ \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 12 $$\n\nTo solve for (5 - a)^2, I can multiply both sides by 3/4. Let me do that:\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n$$ 4(5 - a)^2 = 36 $$\n\nThen divide both sides by 4:\n\n$$ (5 - a)^2 = 9 $$\n\nAlright, so now we have a square equals 9. Taking square roots on both sides, we need to remember that there are two solutions, positive and negative.\n\nSo:\n\n$$ 5 - a = \\pm 3 $$\n\nTherefore, solving for 'a':\n\nFirst case:\n\n$$ 5 - a = 3 $$\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n$$ -a = 3 - 5 $$\n$$ -a = -2 $$\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n$$ a = 2 $$\n\nSecond case:\n\n$$ 5 - a = -3 $$\n\nAgain, subtract 5:\n\n$$ -a = -3 - 5 $$\n$$ -a = -8 $$\nMultiply by -1:\n\n$$ a = 8 $$\n\nSo the solutions are a = 2 and a = 8. The question asks for the sum of the values of a. So 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nWait, let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n3*5² - [4(5 - a)²]/3 = 63\n\nCalculating 3*25 = 75. Then subtract [4(5 - a)^2]/3 equals 63. So 75 - something equals 63. Therefore, that something is 12. Which led me to [4(5 - a)^2]/3 = 12. Multiply both sides by 3: 4(5 - a)^2 = 36. Divide by 4: (5 - a)^2 = 9. Square roots: 5 - a = ±3. Then solving gives a = 2 and 8. Sum is 10. Seems okay.\n\nLet me plug back the values into the original equation to check.\n\nFirst, a = 2:\n\nCompute 3*5² - [4*(5 - 2)^2]/3.\n\n3*25 - [4*(3)^2]/3 = 75 - [4*9]/3 = 75 - 36/3 = 75 - 12 = 63. Correct.\n\nNow, a = 8:\n\n3*25 - [4*(5 - 8)^2]/3 = 75 - [4*(-3)^2]/3 = 75 - [4*9]/3 = same as before, 75 - 12 = 63. Correct.\n\nTherefore, both solutions work. The sum is 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10. So the sum of the values of a is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the values of $ a $ is \\boxed{10}.\n</think>"}
