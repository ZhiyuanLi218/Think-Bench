The question is asking for the probability that the frog ever reaches pad 7. The answer needs to be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can model this as a probability problem where we want the probability of reaching pad 7 starting from pad 1. Since the frog can jump either +1 or +2 each time, randomly. It seems like a recursive problem. Let me try to think recursively. Let's denote P(k) as the probability that the frog reaches pad 7 starting from pad k. Our goal is to find P(1).\n\nNow, if the frog is already on pad 7, then the probability is obviously 1. So P(7) = 1. If the frog is on a pad beyond 7, like pad 8 or higher, then it has already passed 7, so the probability is still 1? Wait, but the problem says \"visits pad 7\". So if the frog starts on pad 8, it can't go back to 7, right? Because it can only jump forward. Therefore, once it passes 7, it can't come back. Therefore, for k ≥ 7, P(k) = 1. But actually, if the frog starts on pad 7, it's already there, so P(7) = 1. For k > 7, since the frog can't go back, starting from k > 7, it never visits 7 again, but wait, actually, if it starts at k > 7, it has already passed 7. Wait, but the problem says \"the probability that the frog visits pad 7\". So if it starts on pad 8, does that count as visiting? No, because it starts on 8. So if the frog starts on pad k where k ≥ 7, then P(k) is 1 only if k = 7. For k > 7, the frog never visits pad 7, so P(k) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, if k > 7, starting from k, the frog can't go back to 7, so the probability of visiting 7 is 0. Therefore, P(k) = 0 for k ≥ 8? Wait, but the problem says \"the probability that the frog visits pad 7\". So starting from pad 7, it's already there, so P(7) = 1. Starting from pad 8 or higher, since the frog can't go backwards, it can't reach 7, so P(k) = 0 for k ≥ 8. Therefore, for k < 7, P(k) = 1/2 * P(k+1) + 1/2 * P(k+2). Because from pad k, the frog jumps to k+1 or k+2 with probability 1/2 each, and then the probability of eventually reaching 7 is the average of the probabilities from those two pads.\n\nTherefore, we can set up recursive equations for P(1) through P(6). Let me write them down:\n\nFor k = 7: P(7) = 1\n\nFor k ≥ 8: P(k) = 0\n\nFor k = 1 to 6: P(k) = (1/2) * P(k+1) + (1/2) * P(k+2)\n\nSo we need to solve these equations. Let me write them out for each k from 1 to 6.\n\nStarting with k=6:\n\nP(6) = (1/2) * P(7) + (1/2) * P(8) = (1/2)(1) + (1/2)(0) = 1/2\n\nSimilarly, k=5:\n\nP(5) = (1/2) * P(6) + (1/2) * P(7) = (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1) = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4\n\nk=4:\n\nP(4) = (1/2) P(5) + (1/2) P(6) = (1/2)(3/4) + (1/2)(1/2) = 3/8 + 1/4 = 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8\n\nk=3:\n\nP(3) = (1/2) P(4) + (1/2) P(5) = (1/2)(5/8) + (1/2)(3/4) = 5/16 + 3/8 = 5/16 + 6/16 = 11/16\n\nk=2:\n\nP(2) = (1/2) P(3) + (1/2) P(4) = (1/2)(11/16) + (1/2)(5/8) = 11/32 + 5/16 = 11/32 + 10/32 = 21/32\n\nk=1:\n\nP(1) = (1/2) P(2) + (1/2) P(3) = (1/2)(21/32) + (1/2)(11/16) = 21/64 + 11/32 = 21/64 + 22/64 = 43/64\n\nWait, so according to this, the probability is 43/64? Let me check my calculations step by step because sometimes when doing fractions, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with P(6):\n\nP(6) = 1/2 * 1 + 1/2 * 0 = 1/2. That seems right.\n\nP(5) = 1/2 * P(6) + 1/2 * P(7) = 1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1 = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4. Correct.\n\nP(4) = 1/2 * P(5) + 1/2 * P(6) = 1/2 * 3/4 + 1/2 * 1/2 = 3/8 + 1/4 = 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8. Correct.\n\nP(3) = 1/2 * P(4) + 1/2 * P(5) = 1/2 * 5/8 + 1/2 * 3/4 = 5/16 + 3/8. Converting 3/8 to 6/16, total 11/16. Correct.\n\nP(2) = 1/2 * P(3) + 1/2 * P(4) = 1/2 * 11/16 + 1/2 * 5/8. Let's compute 11/16 * 1/2 = 11/32. 5/8 * 1/2 = 5/16 = 10/32. So total 21/32. Correct.\n\nP(1) = 1/2 * P(2) + 1/2 * P(3) = 1/2 * 21/32 + 1/2 * 11/16. Let me convert to 64 denominators. 21/32 is 42/64, half of that is 21/64. 11/16 is 44/64, half is 22/64. So total 21 + 22 = 43/64. So 43/64. So the probability is 43/64. Are 43 and 64 coprime? 43 is prime, right? 43 divides 64? No, 43 is less than 64 and doesn't divide it. So yes, 43 and 64 are coprime. Therefore, the answer is 43 + 64 = 107. Wait, but before I get too confident, let me think again if my approach is correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering all possible paths the frog can take from 1 to 7, and summing their probabilities? But that might be complicated because there are infinitely many paths? Wait, no, actually, since the frog can't go backwards, once it passes 7, it can't come back, but to reach 7, the frog must eventually get there. Wait, but the frog could in theory keep jumping +1 forever? But the probability of that is zero. So the probability of never reaching 7 is the probability that the frog somehow keeps avoiding 7 forever. However, since the frog is moving forward, the only way it never reaches 7 is if it jumps to the right in such a way that it skips over 7. Wait, but with the frog starting at 1, can it skip over 7? For example, starting from 1, if it keeps jumping +2, then the positions would be 1, 3, 5, 7, so it would reach 7. Alternatively, if it does some combination of +1 and +2. Wait, actually, no matter what combination of +1 and +2 jumps the frog makes, starting from 1, it can't skip over 7 unless it jumps over it. For example, if the frog is on pad 6, it can jump to 7 or 8. If it's on pad 5, it can jump to 6 or 7. So to skip over 7, the frog would have to be on pad 6 and jump to 8, or on pad 5 and jump to 6 then later jump to 8, but actually, even if you are on pad 6 and jump to 8, you have to pass through 6 first. Wait, starting from 1, the frog can only move forward, so the only way it never reaches 7 is if it reaches some pad beyond 7 without ever stepping on 7. For example, starting from 1, going to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9,... etc. So the frog could reach 6 and then jump to 8, bypassing 7. Similarly, from 5 it could jump to 7 or 6; if it jumps to 6, then from 6 it could jump to 8. So the probability of never reaching 7 is the probability that the frog eventually reaches 6 and then jumps to 8, or reaches some higher pad and keeps going. But calculating that seems complex. However, our initial approach using recursion seems straightforward and gave us 43/64. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think in terms of linear recursions. The recursion formula is P(k) = 1/2 * P(k+1) + 1/2 * P(k+2) for k < 7, with P(7) = 1 and P(k) = 0 for k ≥ 8. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 2P(k) = P(k+1) + P(k+2)\n\nRearranged: P(k+2) = 2P(k) - P(k+1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it as:\n\nP(k+2) + (-1)P(k+1) - 2P(k) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation would be r^2 - r - 2 = 0? Wait, let me check. If we assume solutions of the form P(k) = r^k, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nr^{k+2} = 2 r^k - r^{k+1}\n\nDivide both sides by r^k:\n\nr^2 = 2 - r\n\nTherefore, r^2 + r - 2 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation: r = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [-1 ± 3]/2. Therefore, roots are (2)/2 = 1 and (-4)/2 = -2. Therefore, the general solution is P(k) = A(1)^k + B(-2)^k = A + B(-2)^k.\n\nBut we have boundary conditions. However, note that for k ≥ 8, P(k) = 0. Wait, but our general solution is for the recurrence relation which is valid for k < 7. Wait, maybe we can use this general solution for k ≤ 7?\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is valid for k from 1 to 6. So the solution P(k) = A + B(-2)^k must satisfy the boundary conditions. However, we also have P(7) = 1 and for k ≥ 8, P(k) = 0. But how does that tie in?\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the general solution for k ≤ 7. Let me think. If the recurrence is valid for k from 1 to 6, then P(7) is given as 1, and P(8) is 0. But our recurrence for k=6 would be P(6) = [P(5) + P(7)] / 2, as per original equation. But according to the general solution, P(7) = A + B(-2)^7, and P(6) = A + B(-2)^6, etc. However, we also know that for k ≥ 8, P(k) = 0. Let me see if that can be reconciled.\n\nWait, if we consider that for k ≥ 8, P(k) = 0. But according to the general solution, if we extend it beyond k=7, then P(k) = A + B(-2)^k. If we want P(k) = 0 for k ≥ 8, then we need A + B(-2)^k = 0 for all k ≥ 8. The only way this can be true is if A = 0 and B = 0, which is trivial, but we have non-trivial solutions. Therefore, perhaps my approach here is flawed? Maybe I need to consider that the recurrence is only valid up to k=6, and we have boundary conditions at k=7 and k=8. Therefore, perhaps solving the recurrence with boundary conditions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the general solution for k from 1 to 7, with P(7) = 1, and then ensure that the solution doesn't conflict with P(8) = 0? Wait, but since the recurrence for k=6 relates P(6) to P(7) and P(8). So if we use the general solution up to k=7, then P(8) would be determined by the recurrence? But we have P(8) = 0. Therefore, perhaps we need to set up equations accordingly.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me assume that P(k) = A + B(-2)^k for k from 1 to 7. Then, since we have P(7) = 1:\n\n1 = A + B(-2)^7 = A - 128B.\n\nAdditionally, we need another condition. Since the recurrence should hold for k=6:\n\nFrom the recurrence relation, P(6) = 2P(5) - P(6+1) = 2P(5) - P(7). Wait, no, original recurrence was P(k+2) = 2P(k) - P(k+1). For k=6, P(8) = 2P(6) - P(7). But we know P(8) = 0, so:\n\n0 = 2P(6) - P(7) => 2P(6) = P(7) = 1 => P(6) = 1/2. Which matches our previous calculation. Also, according to the general solution, P(6) = A + B(-2)^6 = A + 64B. Therefore:\n\nA + 64B = 1/2.\n\nWe also have from P(7): A - 128B = 1.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) A + 64B = 1/2\n\n2) A - 128B = 1\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(A - 128B) - (A + 64B) = 1 - 1/2 => -192B = 1/2 => B = -1/(384).\n\nThen plugging back into equation 1: A + 64*(-1/384) = 1/2 => A - 64/384 = 1/2 => A - 1/6 = 1/2 => A = 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666...\n\nSo A = 2/3 and B = -1/384.\n\nTherefore, the general formula for P(k) is:\n\nP(k) = 2/3 + (-1/384)(-2)^k = 2/3 + (1/384)(2)^k * (-1)^{k+1} ?\n\nWait, let me compute it properly:\n\nP(k) = A + B(-2)^k = 2/3 - (1/384)(-2)^k.\n\nWait, B is -1/384, so:\n\nP(k) = 2/3 + (-1/384)(-2)^k = 2/3 + ( (-1)^{k+1} * 2^k ) / 384.\n\nBut let's check for k=7:\n\nP(7) = 2/3 + [(-1)^{8} * 2^7]/384 = 2/3 + (1 * 128)/384 = 2/3 + 128/384 = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Correct. And for k=6:\n\nP(6) = 2/3 + [(-1)^7 * 2^6]/384 = 2/3 - (64)/384 = 2/3 - 1/6 = 4/6 - 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. Correct. So that works. Therefore, we can use this formula to compute P(1):\n\nP(1) = 2/3 + [(-1)^{2} * 2^1]/384 = 2/3 + (1 * 2)/384 = 2/3 + 2/384 = 2/3 + 1/192. Let's compute this:\n\nConvert 2/3 to 128/192. Then 128/192 + 1/192 = 129/192. Simplify this fraction. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 129 ÷ 3 = 43, 192 ÷ 3 = 64. Therefore, 43/64. Which matches our previous result! Therefore, this confirms that P(1) = 43/64. Therefore, the answer is 43 + 64 = 107. Therefore, the answer is 107.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check another value. Let's check P(2):\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nP(2) = 2/3 + [(-1)^{3} * 2^2]/384 = 2/3 + [ -1 * 4 ] / 384 = 2/3 - 4/384 = 2/3 - 1/96. Convert 2/3 to 64/96. 64/96 - 1/96 = 63/96 = 21/32. Which matches our previous calculation. Similarly, P(3):\n\nP(3) = 2/3 + [(-1)^{4} * 2^3]/384 = 2/3 + (8)/384 = 2/3 + 1/48. Convert 2/3 to 32/48. 32/48 + 1/48 = 33/48 = 11/16. Which is correct. So yes, this formula works. Therefore, our answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this problem is using generating functions or counting the number of paths, but since the probabilities are weighted by 1/2 per step, it might complicate things. However, let's try to think in terms of expected number of ways or something.\n\nBut since the frog has a probability of 1/2 at each step, each path from 1 to 7 has a probability of (1/2)^n, where n is the number of jumps. However, the number of paths from 1 to 7 with a certain number of steps... Wait, to reach 7 from 1, the number of jumps required depends on the number of +1 and +2 steps. Let me think. Let me denote that to get from 1 to 7, the frog needs to cover 6 units. Each +1 contributes 1, each +2 contributes 2. Let me say the frog makes m jumps of +2 and n jumps of +1. Then total distance covered is 2m + n = 6. Also, the total number of jumps is m + n. However, the number of ways to arrange these jumps is C(m + n, m). However, each path has probability (1/2)^{m + n}.\n\nTherefore, the total probability would be the sum over all valid m and n of [C(m + n, m) * (1/2)^{m + n}]. But we need to find all non-negative integers m, n such that 2m + n = 6. Let's find all possible (m, n):\n\nFor m = 0: n = 6. Number of paths: C(6, 0) = 1. Probability: 1 * (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n\nFor m = 1: n = 6 - 2 = 4. Number of paths: C(5, 1) = 5. Probability: 5*(1/2)^5 = 5/32.\n\nFor m = 2: n = 6 - 4 = 2. Number of paths: C(4, 2) = 6. Probability: 6*(1/2)^4 = 6/16 = 3/8.\n\nFor m = 3: n = 6 - 6 = 0. Number of paths: C(3, 3) = 1. Probability: 1*(1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nTotal probability would be 1/64 + 5/32 + 6/16 + 1/8. Let me compute that:\n\nConvert all to 64 denominators:\n\n1/64 + 10/64 + 24/64 + 8/64 = (1 + 10 + 24 + 8)/64 = 43/64. Which matches our previous result! Wow, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the probability is indeed 43/64. Therefore, the answer is 43 + 64 = 107. \n\nBut hold on, this approach only considers the paths that reach 7 directly, without considering the possibility of the frog overshooting 7? Wait, no. Wait, actually, in this approach, we are counting all paths that start at 1 and end at 7, with any number of jumps, but each path is a sequence of jumps that takes the frog from 1 to 7 without overshooting? No, actually, no. Wait, actually, in this approach, we're assuming that the frog takes a certain number of +1 and +2 jumps that sum up to 6, which is the difference between pad 1 and pad 7. However, in reality, the frog could overshoot 7 if it makes a jump that takes it beyond 7. But in this calculation, we are only considering paths that land exactly on 7. Therefore, is this approach correct?\n\nWait, here's a problem. The previous methods (recursion and characteristic equation) gave us 43/64 by considering that once the frog passes 7, it's a failure, but in this path-counting approach, we are only counting paths that end exactly on 7. However, isn't there a possibility that the frog could reach 7 in some jumps and then later jump over it? But once it reaches 7, the problem is already satisfied. Therefore, actually, the total probability isn't just the probability of reaching 7 in some number of steps, because once it reaches 7, the process could continue, but the frog has already visited 7. Therefore, the path-counting approach here is actually undercounting? Wait, no, because once the frog reaches 7, we can consider that path as successful, regardless of what happens after. However, in reality, the probability calculation using recursion already accounts for all possibilities, including paths that reach 7 and then continue. However, in the path-counting approach above, we considered only the first time the frog reaches 7. Wait, but in reality, each path that reaches 7 is unique and once it reaches 7, the rest of the path is irrelevant. Therefore, actually, the total probability should be equal to the sum over all possible ways to reach 7 for the first time, multiplied by their probabilities. However, in our calculation above, we counted all paths that end at 7, regardless of whether they had previously reached 7 before. Wait, but if we consider that once the frog reaches 7, it stops? No, the problem doesn't say the frog stops. The frog keeps jumping indefinitely, but we want the probability that at some point it visits 7. Therefore, the probability is 1 minus the probability that it never visits 7. However, in our recursion approach, we calculated the probability of eventually reaching 7 starting from each pad. Therefore, the recursion approach is correct because it inherently considers all possible paths, including those that reach 7 at different times.\n\nBut in our second approach, where we calculated the number of paths that end exactly at 7 with certain numbers of +1 and +2 jumps, multiplied by their probabilities, and added them up, we got 43/64. But how is that possible? Because if the frog could reach 7 in multiple ways, including paths that reach 7 multiple times. However, in reality, the probability of reaching 7 is not just the sum of probabilities of first passage, but since the events are non-overlapping (each path is unique), the total probability is indeed the sum over all possible paths that reach 7, considering that once it reaches 7, it's counted as success. Wait, but in reality, if you have a path that reaches 7 and then continues, how do you count it? Actually, in probability theory, when we want the probability that the frog eventually reaches 7, it's equivalent to the sum over all n ≥ 1 of the probability that the frog first reaches 7 at the nth step. Therefore, our calculation above is actually computing that, because we considered all possible ways to reach 7 for the first time with different numbers of jumps. Wait, but in our calculation above, when we considered the number of paths that result in reaching 7, we didn't specify first passage. However, given that the frog starts at 1 and moves forward only, any path that ends at 7 must be a first passage, because you can't reach 7 twice without going back, which the frog can't do. Therefore, in this case, all paths that end at 7 are first passage paths. Therefore, our calculation is correct. Therefore, the total probability is indeed 43/64, which matches our recursion approach. Therefore, this gives me more confidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 43/64, so p + q is 43 + 64 = 107. Therefore, the answer is 107.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{107}\n</think>"}
