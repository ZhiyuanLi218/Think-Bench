I need to check each option one by one. \n\nStarting with option (A): Base converted to acid salt. The equation given is OH⁻ + 2H⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → HCO₃⁻ + 2H₂O. Hmm, base converted to an acid salt. Sodium compounds are involved, probably sodium hydroxide turning into sodium bicarbonate? Let me think. If a base (like NaOH) reacts with an acid, it should neutralize. But here, the reaction has OH⁻, H⁺, and carbonate. Wait, maybe it's sodium carbonate reacting with an acid to form bicarbonate? But the equation shows OH⁻ combining with H⁺. Normally, when you add acid to a carbonate, you get bicarbonate first. But the equation here seems to have OH⁻ and CO₃²⁻ both reacting with H⁺. Let me balance the charges and atoms. \n\nLeft side: 1 OH⁻, 2 H⁺, 1 CO₃²⁻. Let's count the H and O. On the left, OH⁻ has 1 H and 1 O. 2 H⁺ adds 2 H. CO₃²⁻ has 3 O. So total O is 1 + 3 = 4 O. H is 1 + 2 = 3 H. Charge: -1 (from OH⁻) + 2*(+1) (H⁺) + (-2) (CO₃²⁻) = -1 + 2 - 2 = -1. \n\nRight side: HCO₃⁻ has 1 H, 1 C, 3 O. 2 H₂O has 4 H and 2 O. Total H: 1 + 4 = 5 H? Wait, HCO₃⁻ has 1 H, and each H₂O has 2 H. So total H is 1 + 2*2 = 5? Wait, but the right side is HCO₃⁻ + 2 H₂O. Let me recount. HCO₃⁻ has 1 H, 3 O. The 2 H₂O has 4 H and 2 O. Total O: 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, but on the left side, O was 4? That's a problem. Also, the H count on the left is 3, but on the right it's 5. So maybe this equation isn't balanced. Also, charge on the right: HCO₃⁻ is -1, 2 H₂O is neutral. Total charge -1. So charge is balanced. But the oxygen and hydrogen atoms aren't balanced. So maybe the equation is wrong? For example, if you have OH⁻ reacting with H⁺, normally that would make H₂O. But here, there's also carbonate. Let me think of a real reaction. Suppose sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reacts with carbonic acid (H2CO3). But maybe it's adding H+ to carbonate. If you have CO₃²⁻ + H⁺ → HCO₃⁻. But that would be one H+. If you have two H+ added, you get H2CO3. But here, there's also an OH⁻. Maybe this is not a typical reaction. Perhaps the equation is incorrect because of the stoichiometry. So maybe option A is wrong.\n\nMoving to option (B): Base converted to two salts. The equation is 2 OH⁻ + Cl₂ → ClO⁻ + Cl⁻ + H₂O. This looks like the reaction of chlorine with a base, like sodium hydroxide. For example, the disproportionation reaction of Cl₂ in a basic solution. The standard reaction is Cl₂ + 2 NaOH → NaCl + NaClO + H₂O. The ionic equation would be Cl₂ + 2 OH⁻ → Cl⁻ + ClO⁻ + H₂O. Which matches option B. So the equation here is correct. Let me check the balance. Left side: 2 OH⁻, 1 Cl₂. Right side: 1 ClO⁻, 1 Cl⁻, 1 H₂O. Let's check atoms: Cl: 2 on left, 2 on right. O: 2 on left (from OH⁻), 1 in ClO⁻ and 1 in H2O, total 2. H: 2 from OH⁻, 2 in H2O. Charges: Left side: 2*(-1) = -2. Right side: (-1) + (-1) + 0 = -2. Balanced. So option B seems correct. But wait, the question says \"base converted to two salts\". The base here is OH⁻, and the products are Cl⁻ (sodium chloride) and ClO⁻ (sodium hypochlorite), so two salts. Yes, that's correct. So option B looks good.\n\nOption (C): Peroxide converted to base. Equation: 2 O₂²⁻ + 2 H₂O → 4 OH⁻ + O₂↑. Sodium peroxide (Na₂O₂) reacting with water to form NaOH and O₂. The standard reaction is Na₂O₂ + H₂O → 2 NaOH + ½ O₂. Let me write the ionic equation. The peroxide ion is O₂²⁻. So O₂²⁻ + H₂O → 2 OH⁻ + ½ O₂. But in the equation given here, it's 2 O₂²⁻ + 2 H₂O → 4 OH⁻ + O₂. Let me check the balance. Left side: 2 O₂²⁻ (so 4 O) and 2 H₂O (2 O). Total O: 6. Right side: 4 OH⁻ (4 O) and 1 O₂ (2 O). Total O: 6. H: 2 H₂O has 4 H. Right side: 4 OH⁻ has 4 H. Good. Charges: Left side: 2*(−2) = −4. Right side: 4*(−1) = −4 (from OH⁻) + 0 (O₂) = −4. Balanced. So the equation is correct. But wait, sodium peroxide reacting with water does produce O₂ and NaOH. So option C is correct? But wait, the question is about conversion reactions between compounds of Na. If the peroxide is Na₂O₂, then in the reaction, the O₂²⁻ is reacting. But in reality, the reaction of sodium peroxide with water is: Na₂O₂ + 2 H₂O → 2 NaOH + H₂O₂. Wait, no, actually, I think it directly gives O₂. Let me recall. Sodium peroxide in water: 2 Na₂O₂ + 2 H₂O → 4 NaOH + O₂↑. So the ionic equation would be 2 O₂²⁻ + 2 H₂O → 4 OH⁻ + O₂↑. Which is exactly option C. So option C is correct. Wait, but earlier I thought B was correct. Now, both B and C seem correct? But maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again. For option C: the reaction is 2 O₂²⁻ + 2 H₂O → 4 OH⁻ + O₂. This is correct. So option C is correct. But the question is which one is written correctly. But maybe there's another option?\n\nOption D: Salt converted to another salt: Na₂SiO₃ + 2 H+ → H₂SiO₃↓ + 2 Na+. This is the reaction of sodium silicate with acid to form silicic acid, which is a precipitate. Sodium silicate is a salt, and adding H+ converts it to H2SiO3, another salt? Wait, silicic acid is a weak acid, so in the presence of H+ ions, it precipitates. The ionic equation would be SiO₃²⁻ + 2 H+ → H₂SiO₃↓. The given equation includes the Na+ as a spectator ion, which is correct. So the equation is correct. So D seems correct as well?\n\nBut the question says \"which of the following is written correctly\". If more than one is correct, but the options are (A)-(D), and it's a single choice question. Wait, the original question didn't specify if multiple can be correct, but usually in such questions, only one is correct. Let me check each again.\n\nOption A: As discussed, the equation isn't balanced for H and O. So incorrect.\n\nOption B: Correct, as per the disproportionation of Cl2 in base.\n\nOption C: Correct, as per the sodium peroxide reaction.\n\nOption D: Correct, because adding acid to sodium silicate gives silicic acid precipitate. \n\nBut maybe there's an error in one of them. Let me check D again. The formula for sodium silicate is Na2SiO3. The silicate ion is SiO3^2-. Adding 2 H+ gives H2SiO3. Yes. And the Na+ remains in solution. So the ionic equation is correct. So D is correct. But in some cases, the formula for silicic acid is written as H4SiO4, but maybe H2SiO3 is also acceptable as a condensed form. Let me check. Silicic acid can be written as H2SiO3 or H4SiO4 depending on the context. However, in the reaction of silicate with acid, SiO3^2- + 2 H+ → H2SiO3(s). So if the formula is correct, then D is correct. But if the correct formula is H4SiO4, then the equation would need 2 more H+ ions. However, the question uses H2SiO3, so assuming that's acceptable, then D is correct.\n\nSo if B, C, D are all correct, but maybe the options are designed to have only one correct. Let me check again.\n\nOption C: 2 O2^2- + 2 H2O → 4 OH^- + O2↑. But sodium peroxide (Na2O2) in water: the reaction is Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2O2. Wait, but then H2O2 might decompose? Or does it directly produce O2? I think in reality, sodium peroxide reacts with water to produce oxygen gas and hydroxide ions. Let me check the actual reaction. The correct reaction is 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So the ionic equation is 2 O2^2- + 2 H2O → 4 OH^- + O2↑. Which is exactly option C. So option C is correct.\n\nSo if B, C, D are correct, but the problem is from a test where only one is correct. Let me check each for possible errors.\n\nOption B: 2 OH⁻ + Cl2 → ClO⁻ + Cl⁻ + H2O. Yes, that's correct. In the reaction, chlorine is both oxidized and reduced. The oxidation states: Cl2 is 0. In ClO⁻, Cl is +1. In Cl⁻, it's -1. So yes, disproportionation. Correct.\n\nOption C: Correct as shown.\n\nOption D: The equation is written as Na2SiO3 + 2 H+ → H2SiO3↓ + 2 Na+. Since Na2SiO3 dissociates into 2 Na+ and SiO3^2-, adding 2 H+ gives H2SiO3. So the net ionic equation is SiO3^2- + 2 H+ → H2SiO3(s). The given equation includes the Na+ ions, which are spectators. But in ionic equations, we usually omit the spectator ions. However, the question says \"ionic equations\", which can sometimes include all ions. But in standard practice, the net ionic equation would exclude the Na+. However, if the question allows for full ionic equations (not net), then D's equation is correct. For example, if Na2SiO3 is written as 2 Na+ + SiO3^2- and H+ is added, then combining gives the products. So if the question considers full ionic equations (including all ions), then D is correct. However, if it's supposed to be net ionic, then D is not correct because it includes Na+ which are spectators. But the way the equation is written in D is as a molecular equation converted to ionic? Wait, the equation given in D is written as a formula equation with ions. Let me parse it:\n\nNa2SiO3 is a salt, which in solution is 2 Na+ + SiO3^2-. Adding 2 H+ gives H2SiO3(s) and 2 Na+. So the ionic equation would be:\n\nSiO3^2- + 2 H+ → H2SiO3↓ \n\nBut the given equation is Na2SiO3 + 2 H+ → H2SiO3↓ + 2 Na+. This is correct if we consider that Na2SiO3 is a solid or in solution? Wait, Na2SiO3 is a soluble salt, so in the ionic equation, it should be dissociated. Therefore, the correct ionic equation is the net one without Na+. However, if the question presents it as a full ionic equation (including all ions), then D's equation is correct. But typically, in ionic equations, we write the dissociated ions for soluble compounds. So the correct net ionic equation would exclude Na+. Therefore, option D's equation is not the correct ionic equation because it should not include Na+ on both sides as they are spectators. Therefore, D is incorrect. \n\nSo that means only B and C are correct? Let me check again. \n\nOption D: If the question is about the conversion of a salt to another salt, then sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) is converted to silicic acid (H2SiO3), which is considered a salt? Or is H2SiO3 an acid? Silicic acid is a weak acid, so in the presence of excess H+ it precipitates. The conversion here is from a salt (Na2SiO3) to an acid (H2SiO3), not another salt. Therefore, maybe the description in option D is incorrect. The question says \"salt converted to another salt\". But H2SiO3 is an acid, not a salt. Therefore, the description in option D is wrong. Therefore, option D is incorrect. \n\nSo now, only B and C are left. But let me check the original question again. The options are (A)-(D), and the question is which is written correctly. If both B and C are correct, but in the options only one is correct, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check option C again.\n\nOption C: 2 O2^2- + 2 H2O → 4 OH^- + O2↑. But sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacting with water. The actual reaction is Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2O2. But H2O2 can decompose into H2O and O2. However, under standard conditions, does the reaction directly produce O2? Or does it first form H2O2 which then decomposes? In the presence of catalysts or heat, H2O2 decomposes. But in the reaction of sodium peroxide with water, the overall reaction is considered to produce O2 directly. So the ionic equation is as given in option C. Therefore, option C is correct. \n\nBut then, if both B and C are correct, but the options are single choice, perhaps there's a mistake. However, looking back, maybe I made a mistake with option C. Let me check oxidation states. In O2^2- (peroxide ion), each O is -1. In H2O, O is -2. In OH^-, O is -2. In O2 gas, O is 0. Let's check the redox. \n\nThe O in O2^2- goes to O in OH^- (-2) and O in O2 (0). So some O is reduced (from -1 to -2) and some is oxidized (from -1 to 0). This is a disproportionation reaction. The balanced equation should have 2 O2^2- → 2 O^2- (as in OH^-) and 1 O2 (from oxidation). Let me do the electron transfer. \n\nFor reduction: O goes from -1 to -2 → gain 1 electron per O. Since there are two O in O2^2-, if both are reduced, that would be 2 electrons. But in reality, only some O is reduced. Let me think. Let's take the reaction:\n\n2 O2^2- + 2 H2O → 4 OH^- + O2↑\n\nLet me split into half-reactions. \n\nReduction half-reaction: O in O2^2- is reduced to OH^-.\n\nOxidation half-reaction: O in O2^2- is oxidized to O2.\n\nLet me balance each.\n\nFor reduction: O2^2- → OH^-\n\nEach O in O2^2- is -1. In OH^-, O is -2. So each O is gaining 1 electron. Let's say we have two O's. Suppose we split the O2^2- into two OH^-? Wait, maybe it's better to handle per O.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in the overall reaction, there are 2 O2^2- (total 4 O atoms). On the product side, there are 4 OH^- (4 O atoms) and 1 O2 (2 O atoms). So total O is 6 on both sides. \n\nFor the oxidation: some O goes from -1 (in O2^2-) to 0 (in O2). Let's say x O atoms are oxidized. For each O oxidized, loss of 1 electron. For reduction, some O goes from -1 to -2, gain of 1 electron. Let y O atoms be reduced. \n\nTotal electrons lost: x*(1) \n\nTotal electrons gained: y*(1) \n\nSince electrons lost = gained, x = y. \n\nBut total O atoms: 4 O from O2^2- → 4 O in OH^- and 2 O in O2. So total O is 6. Wait, but original O is 4. Where does the extra 2 O come from? Wait, no, the H2O also contributes O. Let me think again. \n\nThe reaction is 2 O2^2- + 2 H2O → 4 OH^- + O2↑. \n\nO from O2^2-: 2 * 2 O = 4 O.\n\nO from H2O: 2 * 1 O = 2 O. \n\nTotal O on left: 6 O.\n\nOn the right: 4 OH^- has 4 O, and O2 has 2 O. Total 6 O. \n\nSo the O in the products comes from both the peroxide and the water. The oxidation and reduction involve only the O from the peroxide? Or also from water?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to balance the equation using oxidation numbers.\n\nIn O2^2-: each O is -1. \n\nIn OH^-: O is -2. \n\nIn O2: 0. \n\nIn H2O: O is -2. \n\nSo the O in H2O is already at -2, so it doesn't change. \n\nTherefore, the O undergoing redox is only from the O2^2-.\n\nSo for each O in O2^2-:\n\nSome go to -2 (in OH^-), others to 0 (in O2).\n\nLet me assume that in the reaction, for each O2^2- (two O atoms), one O is oxidized and one is reduced. \n\nFor example, take one O2^2-: one O goes to O^0 (oxidation) and the other goes to O^-2 (reduction). \n\nFor oxidation: O^-1 → O^0 + 1 e^- \n\nFor reduction: O^-1 + 1 e^- → O^-2 \n\nSo for one O2^2-, total electrons: 1 lost and 1 gained → net 0. \n\nBut we have two O2^2- in the reaction. Let's do it for two O2^2-:\n\nTotal O atoms: 4. Let’s say two O are oxidized to O2 and two are reduced to OH^-.\n\nBut O2 is diatomic. So to form O2, we need even number of O atoms. Suppose two O atoms are oxidized to form 1 O2 molecule. \n\nEach oxidation: O^-1 → O^0 + 1 e^-. For two O atoms, total 2 e^- lost.\n\nFor reduction: Two O atoms are reduced. Each O^-1 + 1 e^- → O^-2. Total 2 e^- gained. \n\nSo overall balanced. \n\nNow, let's write the half-reactions:\n\nOxidation: 2 O^-1 → O2 + 2 e^-\n\nReduction: 2 O^-1 + 2 e^- → 2 O^-2 \n\nCombine them:\n\n2 O^-1 → O2 + 2 e^-\n\n2 O^-1 + 2 e^- → 2 O^-2 \n\nTotal: 4 O^-1 → O2 + 2 O^-2 \n\nWhich simplifies to: 2 O2^2- → O2 + 4 O^-2 \n\nBut O^-2 is in OH^-. \n\nNow, we need to add H2O and H+ or OH^- depending on the solution. Since this is in water, and the reaction produces OH^-, it's in basic conditions? Wait, the reaction is between O2^2- and H2O. \n\nLet me reconstruct the overall reaction. \n\nFrom the half-reactions:\n\nOxidation: 2 O^2- (from O2^2-?) Wait, no. Let me start over.\n\nThe oxidation half-reaction is:\n\nO^-1 → O^0 + 1 e^-\n\nMultiply by 2 to get O2:\n\n2 O^-1 → O2 + 2 e^-\n\nReduction half-reaction:\n\nO^-1 + 1 e^- → O^-2 \n\nMultiply by 2:\n\n2 O^-1 + 2 e^- → 2 O^-2 \n\nCombine:\n\nTotal: 4 O^-1 → O2 + 2 O^-2 \n\nBut where do these O come from? They come from the O2^2- ions. Since each O2^2- has two O atoms, 2 O2^2- provide 4 O atoms. \n\nSo the overall reaction is:\n\n2 O2^2- → O2 + 4 O^-2 \n\nNow, these O^-2 are in the form of OH^- since the reaction is in water. \n\nSo to balance the O and H, we need to add H2O and OH^-.\n\nLet me write the overall equation:\n\n2 O2^2- + 2 H2O → 4 OH^- + O2↑ \n\nWhich is exactly option C. Therefore, option C is correct. \n\nSo both B and C are correct? But let me check the options again. The question says \"which of the following ionic equations... is written correctly?\" implying only one correct answer. Maybe there is a mistake in my analysis. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption B: 2 OH⁻ + Cl2 → ClO⁻ + Cl⁻ + H2O. This is correct for cold, dilute NaOH solution. However, in concentrated or hot solutions, the products differ. But assuming standard conditions, this is correct. \n\nOption C: Correct as shown. \n\nOption D: As discussed, the description says \"salt converted to another salt\", but H2SiO3 is an acid, so it's incorrect in description. \n\nSo if both B and C are correct, but the options are single-choice, there might be an error. However, in some cases, maybe one of them has an error. Let me check the stoichiometry again for B. \n\nThe equation for B is 2 OH⁻ + Cl2 → ClO⁻ + Cl⁻ + H2O. Let's count the atoms:\n\nCl: 2 on left (from Cl2), 1 in ClO⁻ and 1 in Cl⁻ → total 2. Good.\n\nO: 2 in OH⁻, 1 in ClO⁻ and 1 in H2O → total 2. Good.\n\nH: 2 in OH⁻, 2 in H2O → balanced. \n\nCharge: Left side: 2*(-1) = -2. Right side: (-1) + (-1) + 0 = -2. Balanced. \n\nYes, correct. \n\nFor option C, the equation is balanced as shown. \n\nBut maybe in some contexts, option C is incorrect. For example, if the reaction of sodium peroxide with water actually produces hydrogen peroxide first, then decomposes. But the overall reaction is still producing O2 and OH^-, so the net equation is as in option C. Therefore, option C is correct. \n\nHowever, in some textbooks, the reaction of peroxides with water is written as:\n\nNa2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2O2\n\nBut H2O2 can further decompose into H2O and O2. If the question assumes that H2O2 is not formed and directly produces O2, then option C is correct. However, if the reaction is considered to first form H2O2 and then decompose, the ionic equation would be different. But since the question provides option C as a single step, it's acceptable. \n\nGiven that both B and C are correct, but in a multiple-choice question with single answer, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, or I missed something. Let me check the original problem statement again. \n\nThe question is about conversion reactions between compounds of Na. Let's check each option's context:\n\nOption A: Base (NaOH?) converted to acid salt (NaHCO3). The equation is OH⁻ + 2 H+ + CO3^2- → HCO3^- + 2 H2O. This seems incorrect because adding H+ to OH⁻ and carbonate would first neutralize the OH⁻. For example, if you have a solution with OH⁻ and CO3^2-, adding H+ would first react with OH⁻: OH⁻ + H+ → H2O. Then any excess H+ would react with CO3^2-: CO3^2- + H+ → HCO3^-. So the overall reaction would be OH⁻ + H+ → H2O and CO3^2- + H+ → HCO3^-. But option A combines them into one equation with 2 H+ per OH⁻ and CO3^2-, which is not correct. The correct combined equation would be OH⁻ + CO3^2- + 2 H+ → HCO3^- + H2O. Wait, let me think. Suppose you have 1 OH⁻ and 1 CO3^2- and add 2 H+. The H+ would first neutralize the OH⁻: OH⁻ + H+ → H2O. Then the remaining H+ reacts with CO3^2-: CO3^2- + H+ → HCO3^-. Total equation: OH⁻ + CO3^2- + 2 H+ → HCO3^- + H2O. But option A has OH⁻ + 2 H+ + CO3^2- → HCO3^- + 2 H2O. Which would mean that two H+ are reacting with OH⁻ and CO3^2-. But the correct equation should have only one H2O from OH⁻ and one H2O from... no. Let me balance properly. \n\nLet me write it step by step:\n\n1. OH⁻ + H+ → H2O\n\n2. CO3^2- + H+ → HCO3^-\n\nAdding these two equations: OH⁻ + CO3^2- + 2 H+ → HCO3^- + H2O \n\nBut option A says OH⁻ + 2 H+ + CO3^2- → HCO3^- + 2 H2O. Which implies an extra H2O. This suggests that there's an error in option A. Therefore, option A is incorrect. \n\nSo back to B and C. If the question is from a Chinese textbook or similar, sometimes there might be specific conventions. For example, in option C, sodium peroxide reacting with water produces O2 and NaOH. The equation given in option C is correct. \n\nBut if I have to choose between B and C, which one is more likely to be the intended correct answer? Let me think. \n\nOption B is a classic disproportionation reaction of chlorine in base, which is a standard reaction. Option C is about sodium peroxide reacting with water, which is also a standard reaction. Both are correct. However, looking at the options, maybe there's a typo or mistake in one of them. \n\nWait, let me check the charges again for option C. Left side: 2 O2^2- is -4 charge. 2 H2O is neutral. Total -4. Right side: 4 OH^- is -4, O2 is neutral. Total -4. Charges balanced. Correct. \n\nSo both B and C are correct. But the problem is presented as a single-answer question. This suggests that there might be an error in the options, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe one of the options is incorrect in another way. \n\nWait, looking at option C again: the reaction produces O2 gas. The equation shows O2↑, which is correct. \n\nGiven that, and if the original question allows multiple correct answers, but in the context of a typical test question with single correct answer, perhaps there is a trick. Let me check the descriptions again. \n\nFor option C: \"Peroxide converted to base\". Sodium peroxide is converted to NaOH (base). The equation shows O2^2- converting to OH^-, so yes. Correct. \n\nFor option B: \"Base converted to two salts\". The base (NaOH) is converted to NaCl and NaClO, which are two salts. Correct. \n\nSo both B and C are correct. However, looking back at the original options, maybe there is a mistake in the options provided. Alternatively, maybe I misread the equations. Let me check the equations again. \n\nOption B: 2 OH⁻ + Cl2 = ClO⁻ + Cl⁻ + H2O. Yes, correct. \n\nOption C: 2 O2^2- + 2 H2O = 4 OH⁻ + O2↑. Correct. \n\nBut if the question is from a source that expects only one correct answer, perhaps there's a mistake in the options. However, since I have to choose based on the analysis, and both B and C are correct, but the options are labeled (A)-(D), it's possible that the intended answer is B and C, but since I need to choose one, maybe there's another error. \n\nWait, let me check the original question again. The user provided the options as (A)-(D). Maybe there's a mistake in my analysis of one of them. \n\nLet me check option D again. The description says \"salt converted to another salt\". Sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) is a salt. Adding H+ converts it to H2SiO3, which is silicic acid, not a salt. Therefore, the description in D is incorrect, making option D wrong. \n\nSo between B and C. If I have to choose, and assuming the question has only one correct answer, perhaps there's a standard answer expected. In many textbooks, the reaction in option B is a common one, whereas the reaction in C might be less commonly tested. However, both are correct. \n\nBut looking back at the initial problem statement, perhaps there's a detail I missed. For example, in option C, the peroxide is O2^2-, and the reaction produces OH^- and O2. This is correct. \n\nSince both B and C are correct, but the options are single-choice, I might have to consider if there's a standard answer. However, given that the user is asking for the correct one, and both B and C seem correct, but in the absence of further information, I'll have to go with the most likely intended answer. \n\nIn many standard tests, the reaction of Cl2 with NaOH is a classic example, so option B is likely intended as correct. However, option C is also correct. Given that, but since the user might expect one answer, I'll have to choose based on possible errors. \n\nWait, let me check the stoichiometry in option C again. The equation is 2 O2^2- + 2 H2O → 4 OH^- + O2↑. Let me count the oxygen atoms:\n\nLeft side: 2*2 (from O2^2-) + 2*1 (from H2O) = 4 + 2 = 6 O.\n\nRight side: 4*1 (from OH^-) + 2 (from O2) = 4 + 2 = 6 O. Correct. \n\nHydrogen: Left side: 2*2 = 4 H (from H2O). Right side: 4*1 (from OH^-) = 4 H. Correct. \n\nCharge: Left side: -4 (from 2 O2^2-). Right side: -4 (from 4 OH^-). Correct. \n\nSo option C is correct. \n\nGiven that, and if the question allows for multiple correct answers, but the user hasn't specified, but since it's presented as options (A)-(D), likely only one is correct. Perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of option C. \n\nWait, another angle: the question says \"conversion reactions between compounds of Na\". For option C, the peroxide is a compound of Na (Na2O2), and it's converted to NaOH (a base). The equation shows O2^2- converting to OH^-, which is part of NaOH. So it's a conversion between compounds of Na. Correct. \n\nFor option B, Cl2 is not a compound of Na, but the reaction is with NaOH (a compound of Na), converting the base (NaOH) into two salts (NaCl and NaClO). So it is a conversion between compounds of Na. Correct. \n\nSo both B and C are conversions between compounds of Na. \n\nGiven this, and since both are correct, but the options are single-choice, I might have to conclude that there's an error in the question. However, since I need to provide an answer, and considering that sometimes in such questions, the most straightforward or commonly tested reaction is the intended answer, I'll go with option B and C both being correct. But since I can't choose both, perhaps the intended answer is B. \n\nBut given the detailed analysis, both B and C are correct. However, looking back at the options, let me check if there's any other error. \n\nWait, in option C, the formula for peroxide is O2^2-. Yes. The reaction is correct. \n\nIn option B, the equation is correct. \n\nSince both are correct, but the options don't allow multiple selections, it's possible that the intended answer is B, as it's a classic reaction, while C might have been overlooked. However, based on the analysis, both are correct. \n\nBut since I have to choose one, and given that in some educational systems, certain reactions are emphasized more, I'll go with B as the correct answer. But I'm conflicted because C is also correct. \n\nWait, let me check once more for any possible mistake in option C. For example, is the coefficient correct? \n\nThe balanced equation is 2 O2^2- + 2 H2O → 4 OH^- + O2↑. Yes. \n\nYes, correct. \n\nGiven that, I think the question might have two correct answers, but since the options are given as single-choice, it's possible that there's a mistake. However, since the user is asking for the correct one, and I have to choose, I'll go with both B and C as correct. But since the options are A-D, and the user might expect one answer, I'll check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where only one is correct. For example, in some sources, option C might be incorrect due to the reaction producing H2O2 first, but as a net reaction, it's still producing O2 and OH^-. \n\nGiven the information I have, I'll conclude that both B and C are correct, but since I must choose one, and given that in some contexts, option B is more commonly tested, I'll select B and C. However, since I can only provide one answer, and the user might expect one, I'll go with B and C. But this is conflicting. \n\nWait, looking at the initial problem statement, the user might have intended only one correct answer. Given that, and since in some sources, option C might be considered incorrect due to the reaction not being directly producing O2 (but instead H2O2), but in reality, the overall reaction is correct, I'll proceed with both B and C being correct. However, since the user might expect one, and given that the description in option C says \"peroxide converted to base\", which is correct (producing OH^-), and the equation is balanced, I'll conclude that both B and C are correct. But since the options are A-D, and the user is likely expecting one, I'll have to check if there's any other mistake. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I think both B and C are correct. However, since the user might have intended only one, and given the options, I'll select B and C. But since I can't, I'll have to choose based on the most likely intended answer. Given that, I'll go with B and C, but since I must pick one, I'll have to say the correct answers are B and C. However, since the user might expect one, perhaps the intended answer is B. \n\nBut given the analysis, I'll state that both B and C are correct, but if forced to choose one, I'll go with B. However, this is not satisfactory. \n\nWait, let me check once more for any possible mistake in option C. For example, is the reaction of sodium peroxide with water actually producing oxygen gas? Yes. Sodium peroxide reacts with water to release oxygen gas and form sodium hydroxide. The equation is correct. \n\nTherefore, I must conclude that both B and C are correct. However, since the options are given as single-choice, there might be a mistake in the question. But given the information, I'll proceed to list both as correct. However, since the user might have intended only one, and in some contexts, option C might be less commonly known, I'll go with B as the correct answer. \n\nBut strictly based on the analysis, both B and C are correct. Since the user is asking for which is written correctly, and both are, but the options are single-choice, there's likely an error. But since I must choose, I'll go with B and C. However, since I can only provide one answer, I'll have to choose based on the most likely intended answer. \n\nGiven the prevalence of the Cl2 + NaOH reaction in standard chemistry, I'll go with B as the correct answer. But I'm conflicted because C is also correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C}\n\nBut since multiple answers are not allowed, and assuming the question expects one, I'll have to go with \\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C} if allowed, but since the user might expect one, I'll check again. \n\nHowever, the original problem might have intended only one correct answer. Given that, and the possibility that option C is incorrect due to the reaction producing H2O2 instead of O2 directly, but in reality, the net reaction is correct. Given the detailed analysis, I'll conclude both are correct. But since I can't select both, and the user might have intended one, I'll proceed with \\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C} if possible. However, in standard multiple-choice settings, only one is correct. Given that, and the possibility that option C is incorrect due to the reaction not being directly producing O2, but in reality it does, I'll stick with both. \n\nBut since I must provide one answer, and given the prevalence of option B in standard curriculum, I'll go with \\boxed{B} as the correct answer.\n</think>"}
