Let me start by recalling what I know. The system has two energy eigenstates, |1⟩ and |2⟩, but these might not be eigenstates of P, Q, or R. The given data is the expectation values of R, R², and R³ in the state |1⟩. Specifically, ⟨1|R|1⟩ = 1, ⟨1|R²|1⟩ = 5/4, and ⟨1|R³|1⟩ = 7/4. \n\nSince the system is two-dimensional, the operator R can be represented as a 2x2 matrix. Let me denote the matrix elements of R in the energy eigenbasis as follows:\n\nR = [ [⟨1|R|1⟩, ⟨1|R|2⟩],\n      [⟨2|R|1⟩, ⟨2|R|2⟩] ]\n\nBut since R is an observable, it must be Hermitian. That means the off-diagonal elements are complex conjugates of each other. So if I let ⟨1|R|2⟩ = a, then ⟨2|R|1⟩ = a*, where a* is the complex conjugate of a. However, since we're dealing with expectation values and the given data doesn't mention any complex numbers, maybe a is real? Or maybe not. Hmm. Well, maybe I can assume that a is real without loss of generality? Or perhaps not. Let me think. If the system is such that all the observables have real matrix elements in this basis, maybe because of some symmetry? But I don't have information about that. So perhaps I need to keep track of the complex conjugate. However, the given expectation values are all real numbers. The expectation value ⟨1|R|1⟩ is 1, which is real. Similarly for ⟨1|R²|1⟩ and ⟨1|R³|1⟩. Since R is Hermitian, R² and R³ are also Hermitian, so their expectation values should be real. Therefore, even if a is complex, the expectation values will still be real. \n\nBut maybe I can choose a basis where a is real? For example, if I rotate the basis states by a phase, I can make ⟨1|R|2⟩ real. Since the problem doesn't specify any particular phase conventions, I can probably assume that a is real. Let me go with that for simplicity. So R can be written as:\n\nR = [ [r11, a],\n      [a, r22] ]\n\nWhere r11 = ⟨1|R|1⟩ = 1, and r22 is ⟨2|R|2⟩, which I don't know yet. And a is ⟨1|R|2⟩, which is real. \n\nNow, since the system is two-dimensional, the eigenvalues of R can be found by solving the characteristic equation. Let me denote the eigenvalues of R as λ₁ and λ₂. Then, the trace of R is λ₁ + λ₂ = r11 + r22 = 1 + r22. The determinant of R is λ₁λ₂ = r11r22 - a² = (1)(r22) - a². \n\nBut I don't know r22 or a yet. However, I also have information about ⟨1|R²|1⟩ and ⟨1|R³|1⟩. Let me compute those in terms of r11, r22, and a.\n\nFirst, let's compute R². \n\nR² = R * R = [ [r11² + a², r11a + a r22],\n               [r11a + a r22, a² + r22²] ]\n\nTherefore, ⟨1|R²|1⟩ is the (1,1) element of R², which is r11² + a². According to the given data, this is equal to 5/4. Since r11 is 1, we have:\n\n1² + a² = 5/4 ⇒ 1 + a² = 5/4 ⇒ a² = 5/4 - 1 = 1/4 ⇒ a = ±1/2.\n\nSo a is either 1/2 or -1/2. Since I assumed a is real, and I can choose the sign based on convention (since the phase can be absorbed, as I thought earlier), maybe I can take a = 1/2 without loss of generality. Although, actually, since a is ⟨1|R|2⟩, which is real, and the sign might affect the eigenvalues. Let me keep both possibilities for now. \n\nNow, moving on. Let me note that a² = 1/4. \n\nNext, let's compute ⟨1|R³|1⟩. To compute this, I need R³. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that R³ = R² * R. Since I already have R², let me compute R³.\n\nFirst, R² is:\n\n[ [1 + a², a(1 + r22)],\n  [a(1 + r22), a² + r22²] ]\n\nBut since a² is 1/4, R² becomes:\n\n[ [1 + 1/4, a(1 + r22)],\n  [a(1 + r22), 1/4 + r22²] ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[ [5/4, a(1 + r22)],\n  [a(1 + r22), 1/4 + r22²] ]\n\nNow, R³ = R² * R. Let me compute the (1,1) element of R³, which is ⟨1|R³|1⟩. \n\nThe (1,1) element is computed as the dot product of the first row of R² and the first column of R. \n\nSo:\n\n(5/4)(r11) + [a(1 + r22)](a) \n\nWhich is:\n\n(5/4)(1) + a²(1 + r22)\n\nWe know that a² = 1/4, so substituting:\n\n5/4 + (1/4)(1 + r22) = 5/4 + 1/4 + (r22)/4 = 6/4 + r22/4 = 3/2 + r22/4\n\nAccording to the given data, ⟨1|R³|1⟩ = 7/4. Therefore:\n\n3/2 + r22/4 = 7/4\n\nLet me solve for r22:\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n6 + r22 = 7 ⇒ r22 = 1\n\nWait, so r22 = 1? Let me check my calculation again.\n\nStarting from ⟨1|R³|1⟩:\n\nFirst, R³'s (1,1) element is [R² * R]_{1,1} = R²_{1,1} * R_{1,1} + R²_{1,2} * R_{2,1}\n\nWhich is (5/4)(1) + [a(1 + r22)] * a. Since R_{2,1} is a (because R is symmetric here, as we assumed a is real). Therefore, yes, that term is a²(1 + r22). \n\nSo substituting:\n\n5/4 + (1/4)(1 + r22) = 5/4 + 1/4 + r22/4 = 6/4 + r22/4 = 3/2 + r22/4. \n\nSet equal to 7/4:\n\n3/2 + r22/4 = 7/4\n\nConvert 3/2 to 6/4:\n\n6/4 + r22/4 = 7/4 ⇒ (6 + r22)/4 = 7/4 ⇒ 6 + r22 = 7 ⇒ r22 = 1. \n\nSo r22 is 1? Wait, but if r11 is also 1, then the diagonal elements of R are both 1, and the off-diagonal elements are ±1/2. \n\nBut then, if R is [[1, 1/2],[1/2, 1]], then what are its eigenvalues?\n\nThe eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[b, c]] are [ (a + c)/2 ± sqrt( ((a - c)/2)^2 + b² ) ]\n\nSo here, a = 1, c = 1, so (a + c)/2 = 1, and ((a - c)/2)^2 + b² = 0 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the eigenvalues are 1 ± 1/2, so 3/2 and 1/2. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of R are 1/2 and 3/2. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's consistent with the given expectation values. Let me verify.\n\nIf R has eigenvalues 1/2 and 3/2, then the expectation value ⟨1|R|1⟩ is 1. Let me see if that's possible. \n\nSuppose the state |1⟩ is not an eigenstate of R, but a superposition of the eigenstates of R. Let me denote the eigenstates of R as |r1⟩ and |r2⟩ with eigenvalues 1/2 and 3/2. \n\nAssume |1⟩ can be written as α|r1⟩ + β|r2⟩, with |α|² + |β|² = 1. \n\nThen ⟨1|R|1⟩ = |α|² (1/2) + |β|² (3/2). According to the given data, this equals 1. Therefore:\n\n(1/2)|α|² + (3/2)|β|² = 1. \n\nBut since |α|² + |β|² = 1, let me denote |α|² = x, so |β|² = 1 - x. Then:\n\n(1/2)x + (3/2)(1 - x) = 1 ⇒ (1/2)x + 3/2 - (3/2)x = 1 ⇒ (-x) + 3/2 = 1 ⇒ -x = -1/2 ⇒ x = 1/2. \n\nTherefore, |α|² = 1/2 and |β|² = 1/2. So the state |1⟩ is an equal superposition of the two eigenstates of R. \n\nThen, let's compute ⟨1|R²|1⟩. Since R² acting on |r1⟩ gives (1/2)^2 |r1⟩ = 1/4 |r1⟩, and similarly for |r2⟩, 9/4 |r2⟩. Therefore:\n\n⟨1|R²|1⟩ = (1/2)(1/4) + (1/2)(9/4) = (1/8 + 9/8) = 10/8 = 5/4. Which matches the given data. \n\nSimilarly, ⟨1|R³|1⟩ would be (1/2)( (1/2)^3 ) + (1/2)( (3/2)^3 ) = (1/2)(1/8) + (1/2)(27/8) = (1/16 + 27/16) = 28/16 = 7/4. Which also matches the given data. \n\nSo all the given expectation values are consistent with R having eigenvalues 1/2 and 3/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues of R are 1/2 and 3/2. \n\nBut let me check if there's another possibility. For example, if a was -1/2 instead of 1/2. If a = -1/2, then R would be [[1, -1/2], [-1/2, 1]], which is also symmetric. The eigenvalues would still be 1 ± sqrt( ((-1/2)^2 )) = same as before, 1 ± 1/2. So eigenvalues are still 1/2 and 3/2. Therefore, regardless of the sign of a, the eigenvalues are the same. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of R are 1/2 and 3/2. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that for any state |ψ⟩, the expectation values ⟨R⟩, ⟨R²⟩, ⟨R³⟩ can be related to the possible eigenvalues if we know the probabilities of being in each eigenstate. \n\nBut since the system is two-level, let me denote that when in state |1⟩, the probabilities of being in the eigenstates of R are p and 1 - p. Then:\n\n⟨R⟩ = pλ₁ + (1 - p)λ₂ = 1,\n\n⟨R²⟩ = pλ₁² + (1 - p)λ₂² = 5/4,\n\n⟨R³⟩ = pλ₁³ + (1 - p)λ₂³ = 7/4.\n\nWe have three equations with three unknowns: p, λ₁, λ₂. \n\nBut we also know that for a two-level system, the eigenvalues λ₁ and λ₂ are the solutions to the characteristic equation, which we found earlier as 1/2 and 3/2. However, let me try solving these equations to confirm. \n\nLet me denote λ₁ and λ₂ as the eigenvalues. Let me assume that λ₁ < λ₂. \n\nFrom the first equation:\n\npλ₁ + (1 - p)λ₂ = 1 ⇒ p(λ₁ - λ₂) + λ₂ = 1 ⇒ p = (1 - λ₂)/(λ₁ - λ₂)\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\npλ₁² + (1 - p)λ₂² = 5/4.\n\nSubstituting p from above:\n\n[(1 - λ₂)/(λ₁ - λ₂)] λ₁² + [1 - (1 - λ₂)/(λ₁ - λ₂)] λ₂² = 5/4\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n[ ( (λ₁ - λ₂) - (1 - λ₂) ) / (λ₁ - λ₂) ] λ₂² = [ (λ₁ - λ₂ - 1 + λ₂ ) / (λ₁ - λ₂) ] λ₂² = [ (λ₁ - 1) / (λ₁ - λ₂) ] λ₂²\n\nTherefore, the entire equation becomes:\n\n(1 - λ₂)λ₁² / (λ₁ - λ₂) + (λ₁ - 1)λ₂² / (λ₁ - λ₂) = 5/4\n\nCombine terms:\n\n[ (1 - λ₂)λ₁² + (λ₁ - 1)λ₂² ] / (λ₁ - λ₂) = 5/4\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(1 - λ₂)λ₁² + (λ₁ - 1)λ₂² \n\n= λ₁² - λ₁²λ₂ + λ₁λ₂² - λ₂² \n\n= λ₁² - λ₂² - λ₁²λ₂ + λ₁λ₂² \n\nFactor terms:\n\n= (λ₁² - λ₂²) - λ₁λ₂(λ₁ - λ₂) \n\n= (λ₁ - λ₂)(λ₁ + λ₂) - λ₁λ₂(λ₁ - λ₂) \n\n= (λ₁ - λ₂)[λ₁ + λ₂ - λ₁λ₂]\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n[ (λ₁ - λ₂)[λ₁ + λ₂ - λ₁λ₂] ] / (λ₁ - λ₂) ) = λ₁ + λ₂ - λ₁λ₂ = 5/4 \n\nTherefore:\n\nλ₁ + λ₂ - λ₁λ₂ = 5/4 \n\nSimilarly, we can use the third equation for ⟨R³⟩. Let me do that. \n\nThird equation:\n\npλ₁³ + (1 - p)λ₂³ = 7/4 \n\nAgain, substitute p = (1 - λ₂)/(λ₁ - λ₂)\n\nSo:\n\n[(1 - λ₂)/(λ₁ - λ₂)] λ₁³ + [ (λ₁ - 1)/(λ₁ - λ₂) ] λ₂³ = 7/4 \n\nFollowing similar steps as before, the numerator becomes:\n\n(1 - λ₂)λ₁³ + (λ₁ - 1)λ₂³ \n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= λ₁³ - λ₁³λ₂ + λ₁λ₂³ - λ₂³ \n\n= λ₁³ - λ₂³ - λ₁³λ₂ + λ₁λ₂³ \n\nFactor terms:\n\nGroup first two terms and last two terms:\n\n= [λ₁³ - λ₂³] - λ₁λ₂[λ₁² - λ₂²] \n\nNote that λ₁³ - λ₂³ = (λ₁ - λ₂)(λ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂²)\n\nAnd λ₁² - λ₂² = (λ₁ - λ₂)(λ₁ + λ₂)\n\nTherefore:\n\n= (λ₁ - λ₂)(λ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂²) - λ₁λ₂(λ₁ - λ₂)(λ₁ + λ₂)\n\nFactor out (λ₁ - λ₂):\n\n= (λ₁ - λ₂)[λ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂² - λ₁λ₂(λ₁ + λ₂)/ (λ₁ - λ₂)? Wait:\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nIt is (λ₁ - λ₂)[λ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂² - λ₁λ₂(λ₁ + λ₂)/something? Wait:\n\nWait, no, the second term is -λ₁λ₂*(λ₁ - λ₂)(λ₁ + λ₂). Wait, no:\n\nWait, the entire expression is:\n\n(λ₁ - λ₂)(λ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂²) - λ₁λ₂(λ₁ - λ₂)(λ₁ + λ₂)\n\nFactor out (λ₁ - λ₂):\n\n= (λ₁ - λ₂)[λ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂² - λ₁λ₂(λ₁ + λ₂)]\n\nLet me compute the term in brackets:\n\nλ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂² - λ₁²λ₂ - λ₁λ₂² \n\nHmm. Let me factor terms:\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n= λ₁²(1 - λ₂) + λ₂²(1 - λ₁) + λ₁λ₂(1 - λ₁ - λ₂ + ...? Maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of previous results. \n\nAlternatively, since we already have from the second equation that λ₁ + λ₂ - λ₁λ₂ = 5/4, perhaps we can find relations between λ₁ + λ₂ and λ₁λ₂. Let me denote S = λ₁ + λ₂ and P = λ₁λ₂. Then the equation from ⟨R²⟩ becomes S - P = 5/4. \n\nSimilarly, for the third equation, let me see:\n\nThe numerator we had was (λ₁ - λ₂)[...], and after dividing by (λ₁ - λ₂), we get [...] = 7/4*(λ₁ - λ₂). Wait, no, the third equation was:\n\n[ (λ₁ - λ₂)[...] ] / (λ₁ - λ₂) ) = [...] = 7/4. Therefore:\n\nThe term in brackets must equal 7/4. Let me denote the term in brackets as:\n\nλ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂² - λ₁λ₂(λ₁ + λ₂) \n\nLet me express this in terms of S and P. \n\nNote that λ₁² + λ₂² = S² - 2P. Therefore:\n\nλ₁² + λ₁λ₂ + λ₂² = S² - 2P + P = S² - P.\n\nThen subtract λ₁λ₂(λ₁ + λ₂) = P*S. Therefore, the entire term is:\n\nS² - P - P*S = S² - P(1 + S)\n\nTherefore, from the third equation, we have:\n\nS² - P(1 + S) = 7/4 \n\nBut from the second equation, we had S - P = 5/4 ⇒ P = S - 5/4. \n\nTherefore, substitute P = S - 5/4 into the third equation:\n\nS² - (S - 5/4)(1 + S) = 7/4 \n\nLet me expand (S - 5/4)(1 + S):\n\n= S(1 + S) - 5/4(1 + S) = S + S² - 5/4 - (5/4)S \n\n= S² + S - (5/4)S - 5/4 \n\n= S² + ( -1/4 )S - 5/4 \n\nTherefore, the third equation becomes:\n\nS² - [ S² - (1/4)S - 5/4 ] = 7/4 \n\nWait, no. The equation is:\n\nS² - [S² - (1/4)S - 5/4] = 7/4 ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nS² - P(1 + S) = 7/4, with P = S - 5/4.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nS² - (S - 5/4)(1 + S) = 7/4 \n\nWhich equals:\n\nS² - [S² + S - (5/4)S - 5/4] = 7/4 \n\nWait, expanding (S - 5/4)(1 + S):\n\n= S*(1 + S) - 5/4*(1 + S) \n\n= S + S² - 5/4 - (5/4)S \n\n= S² + S - (5/4)S - 5/4 \n\n= S² + ( -1/4 )S - 5/4 \n\nTherefore:\n\nS² - [ S² - (1/4)S - 5/4 ] = 7/4 \n\nCompute left-hand side:\n\nS² - S² + (1/4)S + 5/4 = (1/4)S + 5/4 \n\nSet equal to 7/4:\n\n(1/4)S + 5/4 = 7/4 ⇒ (1/4)S = 2/4 ⇒ S = 2 \n\nTherefore, S = λ₁ + λ₂ = 2. \n\nFrom the second equation, P = S - 5/4 = 2 - 5/4 = 3/4. \n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nλ₁ + λ₂ = 2 \n\nλ₁λ₂ = 3/4 \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues λ₁ and λ₂ satisfy the quadratic equation:\n\nx² - Sx + P = 0 ⇒ x² - 2x + 3/4 = 0 \n\nSolving this quadratic equation:\n\nx = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 3)] / 2 = [2 ± 1]/2 ⇒ (2 + 1)/2 = 3/2, (2 - 1)/2 = 1/2. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are 1/2 and 3/2, as before. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the eigenvalues of R are 1/2 and 3/2. \n\nJust to recap, using the matrix approach, we found that R has eigenvalues 1/2 and 3/2. Using the probabilistic approach with the expectation values, we also arrived at the same conclusion. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the eigenvalues of R are 1/2 and 3/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe eigenvalues of $ R $ are \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} and \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{2}}.\n</think>"}
