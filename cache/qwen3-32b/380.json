Particle A has a charge of 2Q, and particle B has a charge of Q. The question is asking for the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B. The options are A:4:01, B:2:01, C:1:01, D:1:02. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that electric force between two charges is governed by Coulomb's Law. Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant. \n\nSo, applying Coulomb's Law here, the force on A due to B should be F_A = k * |(2Q) * Q| / (4 m)². Similarly, the force on B due to A would be F_B = k * |Q * 2Q| / (4 m)². Wait, but isn't that the same thing? Because multiplication is commutative, so (2Q * Q) is the same as (Q * 2Q). Therefore, F_A and F_B should be equal in magnitude, right?\n\nBut hold on, the question is about the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B. If both forces are calculated using the same formula and result in the same value, then the ratio should be 1:1. That would correspond to option C. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something here.\n\nNewton's Third Law comes to mind. It states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, the force that A exerts on B should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that B exerts on A. Therefore, regardless of the charges, the forces should be equal. So even if one charge is twice as big as the other, the forces they exert on each other are still equal. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing electric field with force. The electric force depends on both charges, but each charge experiences a force due to the other. So, even though particle A has a larger charge, the force it experiences is still determined by the product of both charges. Therefore, changing the charge of A or B affects both forces equally. \n\nLet me plug in some numbers to verify. Suppose Q is 1 Coulomb for simplicity, then particle A has 2 Coulombs. The distance is 4 meters. Then F_A = k * |2 * 1| / 4² = k * 2 / 16 = k / 8. Similarly, F_B = k * |1 * 2| / 4² = same thing, k / 8. So they are equal. Therefore, the ratio is 1:1. \n\nBut wait, the options given are A:4:01, B:2:01, C:1:01, D:1:02. So option C is 1:1. Therefore, the answer should be C. \n\nBut why do they give this question? Maybe to test if someone mistakenly thinks that because one charge is bigger, the force on it is bigger. But no, according to Coulomb's Law and Newton's Third Law, the forces are equal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that since F is proportional to q1*q2, if you look at the force on A, maybe it's proportional to qA*qB, and same for force on B. But actually, the force on each is proportional to their own charge times the other's charge. Since multiplication is commutative, they are equal. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes in problems with electric fields, the electric field from one charge on another is different, but the force is the electric field times the charge. For example, the electric field of A at the location of B would be E_A = k*2Q / r², and the force on B would be E_A * Q. Similarly, the electric field of B at the location of A is E_B = k*Q / r², and the force on A is E_B * 2Q. So let's calculate both forces:\n\nForce on B: E_A * Q = (k*2Q / r²) * Q = 2kQ² / r².\n\nForce on A: E_B * 2Q = (k*Q / r²) * 2Q = 2kQ² / r².\n\nSame result. Therefore, the forces are equal. Therefore, ratio is 1:1. \n\nSo the answer is C. \n\nBut let me check if there's any trick here. The problem says \"two isolated particles,\" so no other charges around. The distance is 4 meters. Charges are 2Q and Q. The question is about the ratio of the magnitudes. So no direction involved, just magnitude. \n\nIs there a possibility that the forces are different because of something else? Like if they are in different media? But the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So assuming vacuum or same medium. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might confuse the electric field produced by each particle with the force. For example, particle A produces a stronger electric field than B, but the force also depends on the charge experiencing the field. So even though A's electric field is stronger at B's location, B's smaller charge might result in same force. Wait, but we already saw that the forces are same. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the force on A is proportional to its own charge, and the force on B proportional to its own charge, then they might think the ratio is 2Q/Q = 2:1. But that's wrong because the force isn't just proportional to the charge of the particle, but also the other charge. \n\nSo if you think F_A is proportional to 2Q, and F_B proportional to Q, but actually F_A is proportional to 2Q * Q, and F_B is proportional to Q * 2Q. Hence same. \n\nSo yeah, answer is C. \n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. Let me take Q = 1 C, so 2Q = 2 C. Distance = 4 m. \n\nCoulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². \n\nForce on A due to B: F = k * |qA * qB| / r² = 8.988e9 * (2*1) / 16 = 8.988e9 * 2 / 16 ≈ 8.988e9 * 0.125 ≈ 1.1235e9 N.\n\nForce on B due to A: same calculation, since it's |qB * qA| / r², which is same as above. So same value. \n\nTherefore, ratio is 1:1. So answer C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C:1:01.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
