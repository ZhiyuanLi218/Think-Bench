I need to figure out which method among A, B, C, D doesn't work for removing the impurity from the gas. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: SO2 with H2S impurity, using acidic potassium permanganate solution. Hmm. I remember that potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. H2S is a reducing agent. So maybe the H2S reacts with KMnO4. Let me think about the reactions. H2S can be oxidized to sulfur or sulfate, depending on the conditions. SO2 is also a reducing agent but maybe less so than H2S. The acidic KMnO4 would oxidize H2S. Let me check: For example, in acidic solution, MnO4^- is reduced to Mn²+. H2S would be oxidized. The reaction might be something like 5 H2S + 2 MnO4^- + 6 H+ → 5 S + 2 Mn²+ + 8 H2O. So the H2S gets removed by reacting with KMnO4, while SO2 might not react as readily? Or does SO2 also react? Wait, SO2 can also be oxidized by KMnO4. For example, 5 SO2 + 2 MnO4^- + 2 H2O → 5 SO4^2- + 2 Mn²+ + 4 H+. So if both H2S and SO2 are present, they might both react. But the question is about removing H2S impurity from SO2. If the acidic KMnO4 oxidizes both, then it would remove H2S but also react with the desired gas SO2. That would not be good. Wait, but maybe the problem is that the method is supposed to remove H2S without affecting the main gas. If the main gas is SO2 and the impurity is H2S, and the method is through acidic KMnO4, which would remove H2S but also oxidize SO2. Therefore, this method would not be suitable because it removes the impurity but also affects the main gas. So option A might be the incorrect method. But I need to check the other options first.\n\nOption B: Cl2 (HCl) through saturated salt water. I remember that HCl is very soluble in water, and saturated NaCl solution has high concentration of Cl- ions. So when the gas mixture goes through the solution, HCl would dissolve into the water, while Cl2 is less soluble because the solution is already saturated with Cl- ions. Therefore, HCl is removed, and Cl2 remains. That seems correct. So B is a valid method.\n\nOption C: N2 (O2) through red-hot copper mesh. The classic way to remove O2 from N2 is to pass it over heated copper. The copper reacts with O2 to form CuO, removing the O2. The reaction is 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. So this method works. So option C is correct.\n\nOption D: NO (NO2) through NaOH solution. NO2 is a basic oxide? Wait, NO2 is an acidic oxide. It reacts with NaOH. The reaction for NO2 with NaOH is something like 2 NO2 + 2 NaOH → NaNO3 + NaNO2 + H2O. But NO is a neutral oxide, right? Or does it react with NaOH? I think NO doesn't react with NaOH solution under normal conditions. Therefore, passing the gas through NaOH would remove NO2, leaving NO. So D is a valid method.\n\nSo going back to A. The problem is that if you have SO2 as the main gas and H2S as impurity, using acidic KMnO4 would oxidize both. Therefore, you remove H2S but also oxidize some of the SO2. Therefore, this method is not suitable. Hence, option A cannot achieve the purpose. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Suppose the H2S is in small amounts. Maybe the acidic KMnO4 is more reactive towards H2S? Or maybe the reaction conditions allow selective oxidation? For example, maybe H2S is more readily oxidized than SO2 under acidic KMnO4? Let me think. The standard reduction potentials might help here. The MnO4^- in acidic solution has a high reduction potential. For H2S, the oxidation potential... Let me compare the two. For example, the oxidation of H2S to S is H2S → S + 2 H+ + 2 e^-; the E° for this is around -0.27 V. The reduction of MnO4^- in acidic solution is MnO4^- + 8 H+ + 5 e^- → Mn²+ + 4 H2O, E° = 1.51 V. So overall, the reaction between H2S and MnO4^- would be spontaneous. For SO2, oxidation to SO4^2-: SO2 + 2 H2O → SO4^2- + 4 H+ + 2 e^-, E° for this reaction? I think the standard potential for the oxidation of SO2 is lower than that of H2S. Let me check. The standard reduction potential for SO4^2- + 4 H+ + 2 e^- → SO2 + 2 H2O is around 0.17 V. Therefore, the reverse reaction (oxidation of SO2) would have a potential of -0.17 V. Comparing to H2S oxidation (-0.27 V), both are less than the MnO4^- reduction. However, the reaction with H2S would have a larger E° difference (1.51 - (-0.27) = 1.78 V) versus for SO2 (1.51 - (-0.17) = 1.68 V). Therefore, H2S is more likely to react with MnO4^- than SO2. Therefore, maybe in practice, the acidic KMnO4 would remove H2S impurity without significantly affecting the SO2. Therefore, method A is valid. Wait, so maybe my initial thought was wrong? Then which one is the incorrect method?\n\nHmm. Let me re-examine. If H2S is more easily oxidized than SO2, then in the presence of both, the KMnO4 would first oxidize H2S, and only if there is excess would it oxidize SO2. Therefore, if the amount of H2S is small, maybe the acidic KMnO4 can remove H2S without reacting with the main gas SO2. Therefore, method A is correct. Then which of the options is incorrect?\n\nWait, maybe another angle. Let me think about the actual reactions. Suppose the gas is SO2 with H2S impurity. If you pass it through acidic KMnO4 solution, both H2S and SO2 can be oxidized. However, if the concentration of H2S is low, maybe the KMnO4 is in sufficient quantity to only remove H2S. But in reality, both would react. Therefore, this method would remove H2S but also remove some of the desired SO2. Therefore, it's not a good method. But maybe the question is about whether the method \"cannot achieve the purpose\". If the purpose is to remove H2S, then even if some SO2 is also removed, maybe it's considered not achieving the purpose? Or is the method considered acceptable if it removes the impurity regardless?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another reason. For example, maybe H2S can be removed by acidic KMnO4, but SO2 doesn't react? Is there a possibility that SO2 doesn't react under these conditions? I need to verify.\n\nLooking up, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indeed oxidized by acidic KMnO4. The reaction is as I mentioned before: 5 SO2 + 2 MnO4^- + 2 H2O → 5 SO4^2- + 2 Mn²+ + 4 H+. Therefore, if you pass SO2 through acidic KMnO4, it will be oxidized. Therefore, if the main gas is SO2 and you pass it through acidic KMnO4, you're removing both H2S and some of the SO2. Therefore, this method would not be suitable because it removes the impurity but also the main gas. Therefore, option A cannot achieve the purpose of purifying SO2 from H2S. Instead, it would decrease the amount of SO2. Therefore, option A is the incorrect method. Hence, the answer is A.\n\nBut earlier I thought maybe the potentials suggest H2S is more easily oxidized, so maybe the H2S is removed first. However, in reality, both would react. Therefore, the method is not suitable. Therefore, the answer is option A. So the answer should be (A) A.\n\nWait, but let me check other options again to make sure. For example, option D: NO with NO2 impurity through NaOH. NO2 reacts with NaOH, but NO does not. Therefore, the NO2 is removed, and NO remains. That works. Option C: passing N2 with O2 over hot copper, which removes O2. Correct. Option B: Cl2 with HCl through saturated NaCl solution. Since HCl is more soluble, it dissolves, while Cl2's solubility is low due to the high Cl- concentration (Le Chatelier's principle). Correct. Therefore, only option A is problematic. Therefore, the answer is A, option (A).\n</think>"}
