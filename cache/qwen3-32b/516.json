Let me start by recalling what I know about electric charge and electrons. \n\nFirst, I remember that the charge of a single electron is a fundamental constant. I think it's something like -1.6 times 10 to the negative 19 coulombs. Let me check... Yeah, the elementary charge, which is the charge of a proton or the magnitude of the charge of an electron, is approximately 1.602 × 10^-19 C. Since electrons are negative, their charge is -1.602 × 10^-19 C each. \n\nSo if the object has a total charge of -1 C, that means it has an excess number of electrons contributing to that negative charge. To find the number of electrons, I need to divide the total charge by the charge per electron. \n\nLet me write that down as a formula. The number of electrons (n) would be equal to the total charge (Q) divided by the charge of one electron (e). So:\n\nn = Q / e\n\nBut wait, since the charge of the electron is negative, and the total charge is also negative, dividing them should give a positive number of electrons, which makes sense because you can't have a negative number of electrons. Let me confirm that. If Q is -1 C and e is -1.6 × 10^-19 C, then dividing them gives (-1)/(-1.6 × 10^-19) = 1/(1.6 × 10^-19), which is positive. So that works out.\n\nNow plugging in the numbers:\n\nQ = -1 C\ne = -1.6 × 10^-19 C (but as magnitude, we can use 1.6 × 10^-19 C for calculation)\n\nSo n = 1 C / (1.6 × 10^-19 C/electron)\n\nLet me calculate that. 1 divided by 1.6 is 0.625. So 0.625 × 10^19 electrons. To express that in proper scientific notation, that would be 6.25 × 10^18 electrons. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option A is 6.25 × 10^18. So that seems to be the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCharge per electron: 1.6 × 10^-19 C. Number of electrons needed to make 1 C: 1 / (1.6 × 10^-19). Let me compute 1 / 1.6 first. 1 divided by 1.6 equals 0.625. Then multiplying by 10^19 gives 6.25 × 10^18. Yep, that checks out. \n\nHmm, just to be thorough, maybe I should use more precise numbers. The exact value of the elementary charge is approximately 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C. But since the problem gives options with two significant figures (like 6.25 × 10^18, which is three significant figures, but the options are given as A, B, C, D with different numbers), maybe they expect using 1.6 × 10^-19 as the charge. Let me see. If we use the exact value, 1 / 1.602176634 × 10^-19 would be approximately 6.2417 × 10^18, which rounds to 6.24 × 10^18. But the closest option is A: 6.25 × 10^18. So that's probably the intended answer here. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A.\n</think>"}
