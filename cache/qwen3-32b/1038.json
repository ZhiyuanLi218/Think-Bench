First, I need to understand what's happening in the decomposition of PH3. The problem says that 500 mL of PH3 decomposes and the total volume becomes 600 mL. Then, the hydrogen gas obtained is used in a fuel cell, and we need to find the volume of unreacted H2 when only 50 mL of O2 is used. The answer choices are given, so maybe I can work through the stoichiometry.\n\nStarting with the decomposition of PH3. I remember that PH3 (phosphine) decomposes into phosphorus and hydrogen gas. The balanced equation for this reaction is important. Let me think... Phosphine (PH3) breaks down into P4 (tetraphosphorus) and H2. Let me write the reaction:\n\nPH3 → P4 + H2\n\nBut I need to balance it. Let me count the atoms. On the left, there's 1 P and 3 H. On the right, P4 has 4 P atoms and H2 has 2 H. So to balance the phosphorus, I need 4 PH3 molecules to get 1 P4 molecule. Let me try:\n\n4 PH3 → P4 + 6 H2\n\nYes, because 4 PH3 gives 4 P and 12 H. On the right, P4 has 4 P, and 6 H2 has 12 H. That's balanced. So the balanced equation is 4 PH3 → P4 + 6 H2.\n\nNow, the problem says that 500 mL of PH3 decomposes, and the total volume becomes 600 mL. Let me think about the gas volumes here. PH3 is a gas, and H2 is a gas, but P4 is a solid (assuming standard conditions, though I need to confirm if that's correct). If P4 is a solid, then only PH3 and H2 contribute to the gas volume.\n\nSo initially, there's 500 mL of PH3 gas. After decomposition, the volume increases to 600 mL. Let me calculate how much H2 is produced.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 4 moles of PH3 produce 6 moles of H2. Assuming ideal gas behavior, the volume ratio is the same as the mole ratio. So for every 4 volumes of PH3 decomposed, you get 6 volumes of H2.\n\nBut here, the total volume after decomposition is 600 mL. Let me denote the volume of PH3 that decomposed as x. Then, the volume of PH3 remaining is 500 - x. The volume of H2 produced would be (6/4)x = 1.5x. Since P4 is a solid, it doesn't contribute to the volume. Therefore, the total volume after decomposition is (500 - x) + 1.5x = 500 + 0.5x = 600 mL.\n\nSolving for x:\n\n500 + 0.5x = 600  \n0.5x = 100  \nx = 200 mL\n\nSo, 200 mL of PH3 decomposed. Therefore, the volume of H2 produced is 1.5 * 200 = 300 mL. And the remaining PH3 is 500 - 200 = 300 mL. Wait, but the total volume is 300 mL PH3 + 300 mL H2 = 600 mL, which matches the given. Okay, that seems right.\n\nSo the total H2 obtained from decomposition is 300 mL. Now, this H2 is used in a fuel cell with O2. The question is, when only 50 mL of O2 is used, what is the volume of unreacted H2?\n\nIn a fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen react to form water. The balanced equation is:\n\n2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O\n\nSo the stoichiometry is 2 volumes of H2 reacting with 1 volume of O2. Therefore, if 50 mL of O2 is used, it would react with 100 mL of H2 (since 2:1 ratio).\n\nSo if there's 300 mL of H2, and 100 mL reacts with 50 mL O2, then the remaining H2 is 300 - 100 = 200 mL. Therefore, the answer would be 200 mL, which is option C or D (but both C and D are 200 mL here? Wait, the options given are A:180, B:100, C:200, D:200. Wait, that's a typo? Maybe the user made a mistake in listing the options, but assuming that C is 200 and D is maybe a duplicate or typo. Anyway, the answer is 200 mL.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps. First, decomposition of PH3 gives 300 mL H2. Then, reaction with O2: 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 50 mL O2 would require 100 mL H2. So unreacted H2 is 300 - 100 = 200 mL. Yes, that seems right.\n\nIs there any possibility that the PH3 remaining also affects something? No, because the question specifically says the H2 obtained is used in the fuel cell. So the unreacted PH3 isn't involved here. The fuel cell only uses the H2 produced, right?\n\nSo the answer should be 200 mL, which is option C or D. Since both C and D are 200 mL, maybe it's a typo. But looking back at the original question, the user wrote:\n\n\"A:180 mL B:100 mL C:200 mL D:200 mL\"\n\nThat seems like a mistake, perhaps. But assuming that the correct answer is 200 mL, which is both C and D. But in the original problem statement, maybe there was a different option for D. Maybe the user made a typo. However, given the options as presented, the answer is 200 mL. So probably the intended answer is C:200 mL.\n\nWait, let me check again the decomposition step. Suppose that maybe the P4 is a gas? No, phosphorus is typically a solid at standard conditions. If P4 were a gas, that would change the volume calculations. Let me confirm. Phosphorus exists in several allotropes, but white phosphorus is P4 molecules. At standard temperature and pressure, it's a solid. So in the decomposition reaction, P4 is a solid, so it doesn't contribute to the gas volume. Therefore, the calculation of the volume is correct: initial PH3 volume minus decomposed part plus H2 produced. So 500 - x + 1.5x = 500 + 0.5x = 600 → x=200. Then H2 is 300 mL. Then fuel cell uses 100 mL H2 with 50 mL O2, leaving 200 mL. So answer is 200 mL. Therefore, the correct answer is C or D. Since the user wrote both C and D as 200 mL, but maybe in the original problem it was different. But given the options here, the answer is 200 mL. So I think the correct answer is C or D. But since in the options given, both C and D are 200, maybe it's a duplicate. The user might have intended option C. So I'll go with 200 mL, which is option C or D. But since the user lists both C and D as 200 mL, perhaps there was an error, but assuming that the answer is 200 mL, and given the options, the answer is C or D. But in most cases, the options are unique, so likely a typo. But since the user wrote \"D:200 mL\", maybe they meant to put different options, but regardless, based on the given, the answer is 200 mL.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
