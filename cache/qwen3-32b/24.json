We are to find the perpendicular distance from the center $ O $ to the plane containing triangle $ ABC $, and express it in the form $ \\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}{k} $, where $ m, n, k $ are positive integers, $ m $ and $ k $ are relatively prime, and $ n $ is square-free. Then, we are to compute $ m + n + k $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Use the Geometry of the Sphere and Triangle\n\nSince triangle $ ABC $ lies on the surface of the sphere, all three points are at distance 20 from the center $ O $. The perpendicular distance from $ O $ to the plane of triangle $ ABC $ is denoted $ d $, and the triangle lies on a plane whose distance from $ O $ is $ d $. The triangle's circumradius $ R $ is the distance from the circumcenter (in the plane of the triangle) to each vertex.\n\nBy the 3D geometry of spheres, the triangle's circumradius $ R $ and the distance $ d $ from the sphere's center to the triangle's plane satisfy the Pythagorean relationship:\n\n$$\nd^2 + R^2 = 20^2 = 400\n$$\n\nSo, if we can compute $ R $, we can solve for $ d $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Area of Triangle $ ABC $\n\nWe use **Heron’s formula** to compute the area of triangle $ ABC $. The semi-perimeter is:\n\n$$\ns = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n$$\n\nThen the area $ A $ is:\n\n$$\nA = \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Circumradius $ R $\n\nThe formula for the circumradius of a triangle with side lengths $ a, b, c $ and area $ A $ is:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{abc}{4A}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{13 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 15}{4 \\cdot 84} = \\frac{2730}{336}\n$$\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{65}{8}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Distance $ d $\n\nNow use the equation:\n\n$$\nd^2 + \\left( \\frac{65}{8} \\right)^2 = 400\n\\Rightarrow d^2 = 400 - \\frac{4225}{64} = \\frac{25600 - 4225}{64} = \\frac{21375}{64}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nd = \\frac{\\sqrt{21375}}{8}\n$$\n\nWe now simplify $ \\sqrt{21375} $:\n\n$$\n21375 = 5^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 19 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{21375} = 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5 \\cdot 19} = 15\\sqrt{95}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nd = \\frac{15\\sqrt{95}}{8}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nWe are given that the distance is of the form $ \\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}{k} $, and from the above:\n\n- $ m = 15 $\n- $ n = 95 $\n- $ k = 8 $\n\nThese values satisfy all the conditions: $ m $ and $ k $ are coprime, and $ n $ is square-free.

The sphere has a radius of 20, and the triangle has sides AB=13, BC=14, and CA=15. The answer needs to be in the form m√n / k, where m, n, k are positive integers, m and k are coprime, and n is square-free. Then find m + n + k. \n\nFirst, I remember that when points lie on a sphere, they are all equidistant from the center, which is the radius. So OA = OB = OC = 20. The distance from O to the triangle ABC would be the length of the perpendicular from O to the plane containing ABC. Let me denote this distance as d. \n\nIf I can find the distance d, then since O is the center of the sphere, and the triangle is on the sphere's surface, there must be some relationship between d, the radius of the sphere, and the circumradius of triangle ABC. \n\nLet me recall that for any triangle lying on a plane, the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane can be found using the formula involving the circumradius of the triangle. Specifically, if R is the circumradius of triangle ABC, then the distance d satisfies the equation:\n\nd² + R² = (sphere radius)²\n\nWhich in this case would be:\n\nd² + R² = 20² = 400\n\nTherefore, if I can find R, the circumradius of triangle ABC, then I can solve for d. \n\nSo my task reduces to finding the circumradius of triangle ABC with sides 13, 14, 15. \n\nI remember that the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is:\n\nR = (a b c) / (4 A)\n\nWhere A is the area of the triangle. \n\nSo I need to compute the area of triangle ABC first. Since the sides are 13, 14, 15, which I think is a well-known triangle with integer sides and integer area. Let me check.\n\nUsing Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (13 + 14 + 15)/2 = (42)/2 = 21.\n\nThen the area A = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[21(21 - 13)(21 - 14)(21 - 15)] = √[21 * 8 * 7 * 6]. Let me compute that:\n\n21 * 8 = 168; 7 * 6 = 42; then 168 * 42. Let me compute 168 * 40 = 6720, and 168 * 2 = 336, so total is 6720 + 336 = 7056. Therefore, A = √7056. \n\nWhat is √7056? Let me check. 84² = 7056, because 80²=6400, 85²=7225, so between 80 and 85. 84² = (80 + 4)² = 80² + 2*80*4 + 4² = 6400 + 640 + 16 = 7056. Yes! So the area is 84. \n\nTherefore, R = (a b c) / (4 A) = (13 * 14 * 15) / (4 * 84). Let me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst numerator: 13 * 14 = 182; 182 * 15. Let me compute 180*15=2700, 2*15=30, so total 2730. Denominator: 4 * 84 = 336. Therefore, R = 2730 / 336. Let me simplify this fraction. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 42? Let's see: 336 ÷ 42 = 8. 2730 ÷ 42: 42*60 = 2520, 2730 - 2520 = 210. 210 ÷ 42 = 5. So total is 60 + 5 = 65. Therefore, R = 65 / 8. \n\nWait, 42*65 = 2730? Let me check: 40*65 = 2600, 2*65=130; 2600 + 130 = 2730. Yes. And 42*8=336. So R is 65/8. \n\nTherefore, going back to the previous equation:\n\nd² + (65/8)² = 400\n\nCompute (65/8)²: 65² is 4225, 8² is 64. Therefore:\n\nd² = 400 - 4225/64. \n\nConvert 400 to 64ths: 400 = 400 * 64 / 64 = 25600 / 64. Therefore:\n\nd² = (25600 - 4225)/64 = (25600 - 4225)/64. Let me compute 25600 - 4225. \n\nFirst, 25600 - 4000 = 21600. Then subtract 225 more: 21600 - 225 = 21375. Therefore, d² = 21375 / 64. \n\nTherefore, d = √(21375 / 64) = √21375 / 8. Let me simplify √21375. \n\nFactor 21375. Let me divide by 25 first: 21375 ÷ 25 = 855. Then 855 ÷ 5 = 171. So 21375 = 25 * 5 * 171 = 125 * 171. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait 25 * 5 is 125, and 171. Let me factor 171: 171 = 9 * 19. Therefore, 21375 = 125 * 9 * 19. \n\nSo √(125 * 9 * 19) = √(25 * 5 * 9 * 19) = 5 * 3 * √(5 * 19) = 15√95. \n\nTherefore, √21375 = 15√95, so d = 15√95 / 8. \n\nTherefore, the distance is 15√95 / 8. Let me check if 95 has any square factors. 95 factors into 5 * 19, both primes. Neither 5 nor 19 are squares, and they are distinct primes, so 95 is square-free. \n\nTherefore, m = 15, n = 95, k = 8. Check if m and k are coprime: 15 and 8 share no common factors besides 1. Yes. \n\nTherefore, m + n + k = 15 + 95 + 8 = 118. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, the area of triangle ABC with sides 13, 14, 15. Heron's formula gives 84, which I remember is correct. Then the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4 A) = (13*14*15)/(4*84). Let me recompute:\n\n13*14*15 = 13*210 = 2730. 4*84 = 336. Then 2730 / 336. Dividing numerator and denominator by 42 gives 65 / 8. Correct. \n\nThen d² + (65/8)^2 = 20². 20² is 400. 65 squared is 4225, so 4225 / 64. Then 400 - 4225/64. Converting 400 to 25600/64. 25600 - 4225 is 21375. Then sqrt(21375/64) = sqrt(21375)/8. Factoring 21375:\n\nDivide by 25: 21375 / 25 = 855. 855 / 5 = 171. 171 is 9*19. So total factors: 25 * 5 * 9 * 19 = 5^3 * 3^2 * 19. Therefore sqrt(5^3 * 3^2 * 19) = 5^(1) * 3 * sqrt(5*19) = 15√95. Correct. \n\nSo d = 15√95 / 8. Therefore m=15, n=95, k=8. Sum is 15+95+8=118. \n\nBut wait, I recall that sometimes with spheres and tetrahedrons, there might be another formula, but in this case, since ABC lies on the sphere, and O is the center, then the distance from O to the plane is indeed found by that formula. Let me just verify that reasoning. \n\nImagine the triangle ABC lying on a plane. The circumradius of ABC is R. The center of the sphere O is at distance d from the plane. Then, since OA = OB = OC = 20, which are the hypotenuses of right triangles with legs d and R. Therefore, by Pythagoras, d² + R² = 20². That seems correct. \n\nSo the formula is correct. Therefore, my answer seems correct. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Maybe using coordinates? Although that might be more complicated, but let me try. \n\nLet me suppose triangle ABC is on the plane z = 0 for simplicity, and O is at (0, 0, d). Then the coordinates of A, B, C must satisfy being on the sphere x² + y² + (z - d)^2 = 20². But since they are on the plane z=0, their z-coordinate is 0, so x² + y² + d² = 400. Therefore, each of A, B, C lies on the intersection of the plane z=0 and the sphere, which is a circle with radius sqrt(400 - d²). However, the circumradius of triangle ABC is also sqrt(400 - d²). Therefore, R = sqrt(400 - d²). Wait, but earlier I had d² + R² = 400, which is the same thing. Therefore, R = sqrt(400 - d²). Wait, but in my previous calculation, I had d² + R² = 400. So solving for d gives the same. Therefore, yes, the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, since I calculated R as 65/8, then d² = 400 - (65/8)^2 = 400 - 4225/64 = (25600 - 4225)/64 = 21375/64. Therefore, d = sqrt(21375)/8 = 15√95 / 8. \n\nTherefore, answer is 15 + 95 + 8 = 118. \n\nBut let me check if 21375 is correctly factored. \n\n21375 divided by 25 is 855. 855 divided by 5 is 171. 171 divided by 9 is 19. So 21375 is 25 * 5 * 9 * 19. So that is 5^3 * 3^2 * 19. Taking square root gives 5^(1) * 3 * sqrt(5*19) = 15√95. Correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if the circumradius of triangle ABC is indeed 65/8. \n\nGiven triangle with sides 13,14,15, area 84. Then R = (a b c)/(4 A) = (13*14*15)/(4*84). Let me compute numerator and denominator again. \n\n13*14 is 182. 182*15. Let me compute 182*10=1820, 182*5=910, so total 1820 + 910 = 2730. Denominator is 4*84=336. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 42: 2730 / 42 = 65, 336 / 42 = 8. Therefore R = 65/8. Correct. \n\nAlternatively, another formula for circumradius is a/(2 sin A). Maybe I can check with that. For example, take angle opposite to side a=13, which is angle A. Let me compute sin A. \n\nUsing the area formula: Area = (1/2) bc sin A. So 84 = (1/2)*14*15*sin A => 84 = 105 sin A => sin A = 84 / 105 = 4 / 5. Therefore, sin A = 4/5. Therefore, R = a / (2 sin A) = 13 / (2*(4/5)) = 13 / (8/5) = 13 * 5 / 8 = 65/8. Correct. \n\nTherefore, R is indeed 65/8. So my calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the distance from O to the triangle is 15√95 / 8. \n\nWait, but just to make sure that 15√95 / 8 is in the required form. The problem states that m, n, k are positive integers, m and k are coprime, n is square-free. \n\n15 and 8 are coprime (since 15 factors into 3*5 and 8 is 2^3; no common factors). n is 95, which is 5*19, both primes, neither squared, so square-free. Therefore, yes, this is in the required form. \n\nTherefore, m + n + k = 15 + 95 + 8 = 118. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 118. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{118}\n</think>"}
