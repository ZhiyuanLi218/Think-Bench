A rational expression is undefined when its **denominator equals zero**, because division by zero is undefined in mathematics.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Denominator\n\nThe denominator of the expression is:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 9\n$$\n\nThis is a **difference of squares**, which factors as:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find When the Denominator is Zero\n\nSet the factored form equal to zero:\n\n$$\n(x - 3)(x + 3) = 0\n$$\n\nSolving this equation gives:\n\n$$\nx - 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 3 \\\\\nx + 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -3\n$$\n\nSo, the expression is undefined at $ x = 3 $ and $ x = -3 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check for Cancellation\n\nNow, check whether the numerator and denominator share any common factors that could cancel out:\n\n- The numerator is $ x - 5 $\n- The denominator is $ (x - 3)(x + 3) $\n\nThere is **no common factor** between the numerator and the denominator. So, the discontinuities at $ x = 3 $ and $ x = -3 $ are **not removable**; they are **vertical asymptotes**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSince the denominator becomes zero at two distinct real values — $ x = 3 $ and $ x = -3 $ — the expression is undefined for **two** values of $ x $.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out for how many values of x the expression (x - 5)/(x² - 9) is not defined. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, I remember that a rational expression like this is undefined when the denominator is zero because you can't divide by zero. So, my job is to find all the x-values that make the denominator x² - 9 equal to zero. Then, count how many such values there are. \n\nAlright, let me set the denominator equal to zero and solve for x. So:\n\nx² - 9 = 0\n\nHmm, this looks like a difference of squares. The formula for difference of squares is a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Let me apply that here. \n\nx² - 9 can be written as x² - 3², right? Because 3 squared is 9. So, applying the formula:\n\n(x - 3)(x + 3) = 0\n\nSo, the equation becomes (x - 3)(x + 3) = 0. To solve this, I can set each factor equal to zero:\n\nFirst factor: x - 3 = 0 → x = 3\n\nSecond factor: x + 3 = 0 → x = -3\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 3 and x = -3. Therefore, when x is 3 or -3, the denominator becomes zero, making the expression undefined. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other factors or if I made a mistake in factoring. Let me expand (x - 3)(x + 3) to confirm:\n\n(x - 3)(x + 3) = x*x + x*3 - 3*x - 3*3 = x² + 3x - 3x - 9 = x² - 9. Yep, that's correct. So, the factoring is right. \n\nTherefore, there are two values of x that make the denominator zero: 3 and -3. Hence, the expression is undefined for these two values. \n\nBut wait, let me also check if the numerator and denominator have any common factors. Maybe there's a case where a factor cancels out, which could affect the answer? Let me see. \n\nThe numerator is (x - 5), and the denominator is (x - 3)(x + 3). There are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator because x - 5 doesn't factor further and it's not a multiple of x - 3 or x + 3. \n\nSo, there are no common factors to cancel. Therefore, the original expression doesn't simplify in a way that would remove these discontinuities. That means both x = 3 and x = -3 are indeed points where the function is undefined, and they aren't removable discontinuities or anything like that. \n\nTherefore, the number of values where the expression is undefined is 2. \n\nBut hold on, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The question is asking \"for how many values of x\" the expression is not defined. Since we have a quadratic denominator, which can have at most two real roots, and we found two real roots, that should be all. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve x² - 9 = 0 another way? Let's try moving the 9 to the other side:\n\nx² = 9\n\nTaking square roots of both sides:\n\nx = ±√9 → x = ±3. Yep, same answers. So, that confirms it again. \n\nTherefore, there are exactly two real numbers where the expression is undefined. \n\nIs there a possibility of any other type of undefinedness? For example, sometimes with more complicated functions, you can have other issues, but here we just have a rational function. The only reasons a rational function is undefined are when you divide by zero. There's no even roots here or anything that would require the expression inside to be non-negative. \n\nTherefore, the only problematic points are the ones where the denominator is zero. \n\nSo, to recap: denominator is zero at x = 3 and x = -3. Therefore, two values. Therefore, the answer should be 2. \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe plug in those values into the original expression to confirm that they make the denominator zero. \n\nFirst, x = 3:\n\nDenominator: (3)^2 - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0. Yep, undefined.\n\nx = -3:\n\nDenominator: (-3)^2 - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0. Also undefined. Perfect. \n\nAnd if I pick another value, say x = 0:\n\nDenominator: 0 - 9 = -9 ≠ 0, so defined. \n\nx = 5:\n\nDenominator: 25 - 9 = 16 ≠ 0, defined. \n\nSo, all other x's are okay. \n\nTherefore, conclusion: two values. \n\nI think that's thorough. Maybe I overcomplicated it, but better safe than sorry. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe expression is not defined for \\boxed{2} values of $ x $.\n</think>"}
