For nonmetal elements, the lowest negative oxidation state is typically equal to the number of valence electrons (negative), and the highest positive oxidation state is usually 8 minus the number of valence electrons.

Both P and Cl are in the third period. In the periodic table, P is to the left of Cl, with a smaller atomic number and the same number of electron shells but a weaker nuclear charge.

Hmm, so we have elements X and Y from the third period. The algebraic sum of the highest positive and lowest negative valency of Y is 6. Also, there's a compound [XY4]+[XY6]^- formed by them. We need to figure out which statement among the options is incorrect.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. The third period elements are from sodium (Na) to argon (Ar). Valency refers to the combining capacity of an element. The highest positive valency is usually the group number minus 4 for main group elements, but I need to be careful here. The lowest negative valency is typically 8 minus the group number. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of oxidation states.\n\nThe algebraic sum of the highest positive and lowest negative valency of Y is 6. Let me denote the highest positive oxidation state as +n and the lowest negative as -m. So, according to the problem, n + (-m) = 6? Wait, algebraic sum, so if they are +n and -m, then n - m = 6. But I need to find n and m such that this equation holds.\n\nFor main group elements, the highest oxidation state is typically equal to the number of valence electrons (for nonmetals) or 8 minus the group number (for metals?), but maybe I should think about specific elements.\n\nLet me consider the third period elements:\n\nGroup 1: Na, Group 2: Mg, Group 13: Al, Group 14: Si, Group 15: P, Group 16: S, Group 17: Cl, Group 18: Ar.\n\nFor nonmetals, the highest positive oxidation state is usually equal to the group number minus 10. For example, Cl (Group 17) has +7, S (Group 16) has +6, P (Group 15) has +5, etc. The lowest negative oxidation state is (8 - group number). For example, Cl: 8-17? Wait, no, maybe it's - (group number - 8). For Cl (Group 17), it's -1, since 17 - 16 = 1? Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum negative oxidation state is - (number of electrons needed to complete the octet). For Group 15 elements (like N, P), they need 3 electrons, so -3; Group 16 (O, S): -2; Group 17 (halogens): -1. The highest positive oxidation state is usually equal to the group number minus 10 for the third period nonmetals. For example:\n\n- P (Group 15): +5\n- S (Group 16): +6\n- Cl (Group 17): +7\n\nSo, if Y is a nonmetal, then for the algebraic sum of highest positive and lowest negative valency:\n\nLet's take Y as Cl (Group 17). Highest positive: +7, lowest negative: -1. Sum: 7 + (-1) = 6. That fits the condition given (algebraic sum is 6). So Y could be Cl.\n\nSimilarly, check for S (Group 16): highest positive +6, lowest negative -2. Sum: 6 + (-2) = 4, not 6. For P (Group 15): +5 and -3. Sum is 5 + (-3) = 2. Not 6. So only Cl in third period satisfies this condition. Therefore Y is Cl.\n\nSo Y is Cl (chlorine), which is in Group 17, third period.\n\nNow, the compound formed is [XY4]+ [XY6]^-.\n\nSo in [XY4]+, the overall charge is +1. In [XY6]^-, the charge is -1. Let me figure out the oxidation states of X and Y here.\n\nFirst, let's consider [XY4]+. Let's denote the oxidation state of X as x, and Y as y. Since Y is Cl, its common oxidation states include -1, but in compounds with more electropositive elements, it might have positive oxidation states? Wait, but in [XY4]^+, if X is a metal, maybe Y (Cl) is in a negative oxidation state. Let me think.\n\nIn [XY4]^+, the total charge is +1. Assuming Y is Cl, which is more electronegative than X (since X is from third period as well). So likely Cl is in -1 oxidation state. Then, for [XY4]^+:\n\nx + 4(-1) = +1 → x - 4 = +1 → x = +5.\n\nSimilarly, in [XY6]^-, the charge is -1. If Y is Cl in -1 oxidation state, then:\n\nx + 6(-1) = -1 → x - 6 = -1 → x = +5.\n\nWait, that would mean that in both ions, X has the same oxidation state of +5? That seems odd. Unless X can have +5 in both cases. But how can the same element have +5 oxidation state in both complexes?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in one of the complexes, Cl has a different oxidation state. But that seems unlikely because Cl is more electronegative and would typically have -1 in such compounds. Unless X is a very electronegative element, but since X is in the third period, if it's to the right of Cl, but Cl is in Group 17. The only element to the right of Cl is Ar, which is noble gas. So X can't be Ar. Therefore, X must be to the left of Cl. So X could be elements like Si, P, S, etc. Wait, but if X is to the left of Cl, then it's less electronegative, so Cl would have -1 oxidation state.\n\nBut if in both complexes, X is +5, then let's think about what element in third period can have +5 oxidation state. For example, P can have +5, S can have +6, Cl can have +7, etc. But if X is in the third period, and if X has +5 oxidation state, possible candidates are P (Group 15) or maybe S (but S usually goes up to +6). Let me check.\n\nIf X is P (phosphorus), then in [XY4]^+ would be [PCl4]^+ which is a known ion, like in phosphorus pentachloride, but PCl4+ is part of some salts. Similarly, [PCl6]^- is another known ion. For example, in PCl5, it can act as a Lewis acid and form [PCl4]+[PCl6]^- in solution. So yes, that makes sense. Therefore, X is phosphorus (P), and Y is chlorine (Cl).\n\nTherefore, X is P (Group 15, third period), Y is Cl (Group 17, third period).\n\nNow, let's check the options.\n\nOption A: Atomic radius: X > Y. Since X is P and Y is Cl. In the same period, atomic radius decreases from left to right. So P (Group 15) is to the left of Cl (Group 17), so P has a larger atomic radius than Cl. Therefore, A is correct. So this statement is correct, so not the incorrect one we are looking for.\n\nOption B: Reducing ability of simple hydrides: X > Y. The hydrides are PH3 (for X = P) and HCl (for Y = Cl). The reducing ability refers to how easily the hydride donates electrons. PH3 is a weaker acid than HCl. Wait, but reducing ability... HCl is a strong acid, but PH3 is a weak base? Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the stability of the hydride. Less stable hydrides are better reducing agents because they decompose more easily.\n\nPH3 is less stable than HCl. However, HCl is a strong acid and doesn't act as a reducing agent much. PH3 can act as a reducing agent. For example, PH3 can reduce silver nitrate to metallic silver. On the other hand, HCl can act as a reducing agent in some cases (like with strong oxidizing agents), but generally, PH3 is a stronger reducing agent than HCl. Therefore, reducing ability: PH3 > HCl, so X's hydride (PH3) has greater reducing ability than Y's hydride (HCl). Therefore, statement B is correct. So B is correct, not the incorrect one.\n\nOption C: Among the simple substances formed by elements of the same period, Y has the strongest oxidizing ability. Y is Cl. In the third period, the elements are Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar. The simple substances are Na metal, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl2, Ar. The oxidizing ability refers to how readily they gain electrons. The strongest oxidizing agent in the period would be the most electronegative element, which is Cl. However, oxidizing ability of the element in its elemental form. For example, F2 is a strong oxidizing agent, but here we are in third period. Cl2 is a stronger oxidizing agent than S, P, etc. For example, Cl2 can oxidize Br^- to Br2, but in the same period, since we are talking about third period elements, Cl2 would be the strongest oxidizing agent among them. Therefore, statement C is correct. So C is correct, not the incorrect one.\n\nOption D: In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X. X is P. First ionization energy generally increases across a period, but there are exceptions. For third period, the trend is Na < Mg < Al < Si < P < S < Cl < Ar. Wait, but there are exceptions. For example, Al has lower ionization energy than Mg because of the electron being removed from a p-orbital vs s-orbital. Similarly, S has lower ionization energy than P because of the electron pairing in p-orbitals. Let me recall exact values:\n\nFirst ionization energies (approximate, in kJ/mol):\n\nNa: ~496\n\nMg: ~738\n\nAl: ~578\n\nSi: ~786\n\nP: ~1012\n\nS: ~999\n\nCl: ~1251\n\nAr: ~1521\n\nSo for third period, the order is Na < Al < Mg < Si < S < P < Cl < Ar. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, Mg is 738, Al is 578, so Al < Mg. Then Si is 786, which is higher than Mg. Then P is 1012, which is higher than Si. S is 999, which is slightly less than P. Cl is 1251, higher than S. Ar is 1521.\n\nSo the order is:\n\nNa (496) < Al (578) < Mg (738) < Si (786) < S (999) < P (1012) < Cl (1251) < Ar (1521). Wait, but S is 999 and P is 1012, so P has higher ionization energy than S. So the order is correct.\n\nSo the elements with first ionization energy less than X (which is P, 1012) would be all elements before P in the period. In the same period (third period), the elements with first ionization energy less than P are Na, Al, Mg, Si, S. Wait, S has 999, which is less than P's 1012. So yes, S is included. So the statement says \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\". But what is the exact wording? The option D says: \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X...\" Wait, maybe the original Chinese might be slightly different, but the translation here is a bit unclear. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal option D: \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\". Wait, maybe the original is phrased as \"Among the same period, the first ionization energy of elements less than X...\"? Or perhaps the statement is incomplete? Wait, the user wrote:\n\n(D) In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\n\nBut the statement is presented as a statement that could be correct or incorrect. Wait, maybe the original option is saying something like \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than Y\" or something else? Wait, no, the user wrote:\n\n(D) In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\n\nBut this seems like an incomplete statement. Wait, maybe there was a mistranslation or formatting issue. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem says: \"The following statement is incorrect: Options: ... (D) In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\"\n\nWait, maybe the original Chinese might have been clearer. But given the translation, perhaps it's supposed to say something like \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\" or \"there are elements with first ionization energy less than that of X in the same period\". Given that X is phosphorus (P), in the third period, as per our earlier analysis, there are elements with lower ionization energy than P. For example, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S. So if the statement is \"In the same period, there are elements with first ionization energy less than that of X\", then it's true. However, if the statement is phrased as \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\", which is incomplete, but assuming that the intended meaning is that there are such elements, then the statement would be correct. However, if the option is claiming something else, like X has the lowest ionization energy in the period, then it's incorrect. But given the ambiguity, let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the original option D is supposed to be \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of elements is less than that of X\". If that's the case, then the statement would be saying that all elements in the same period have lower ionization energy than X, which is not true. But since X is P, which has a higher ionization energy than Na, Mg, Al, Si, and S, but lower than Cl and Ar. Therefore, there are elements in the same period with both lower and higher ionization energy than X. Therefore, if the statement is claiming that all elements in the same period have lower ionization energy than X, that would be incorrect. But if the statement is saying that there exist elements with lower ionization energy than X in the same period, then it's correct.\n\nBut the way option D is written is ambiguous. However, given that the problem is from a Chinese source, perhaps there was a mistranslation. In Chinese exams, sometimes the options are phrased as statements that may be correct or not. Let me think again. If the original statement is: \"In the same period, the number of elements with first ionization energy less than X is...\" or something. But given the translation provided, I have to work with what's given.\n\nAssuming that the intended meaning of option D is \"In the same period, there are elements with first ionization energy less than that of X\", which is true because, as we saw, there are several elements (Na, Al, Mg, Si, S) with lower ionization energy than P (X). Therefore, if the statement is asserting that such elements exist, then D is correct. However, if the statement is phrased as \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than Y\", but that's not what's written.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original statement is \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\", but since X is P and Y is Cl, then first ionization energy of P (1012) is less than Cl (1251)? No, P's is higher. Wait, P (1012) is higher than S (999) but lower than Cl (1251). So if the statement was about X (P) vs Y (Cl), then P's ionization energy is less than Cl's. But the option D as written is unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps there's a different approach. Since the other options A, B, C seem correct, maybe D is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nIf option D is supposed to say something like \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\", then since X is P (1012) and Y is Cl (1251), then P's ionization energy is less than Cl's, so the statement would be correct. But that's not option D as written.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original statement in option D is \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X have...\" something else. Given the confusion, perhaps I need to check other options again to see which one is incorrect.\n\nWe already determined that A, B, C are correct. If D is also correct, but the question says one of them is incorrect, then there must be an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's re-examine option B: Reducing ability of simple hydrides: X > Y. X is P, hydride PH3; Y is Cl, hydride HCl. Reducing ability refers to the tendency to donate electrons and be oxidized. PH3 is a stronger reducing agent than HCl. For example, PH3 can reduce AgNO3 to Ag, while HCl is a strong acid but not a good reducing agent. Therefore, statement B is correct, so B is not the incorrect one.\n\nOption C says that among the simple substances formed by elements of the same period, Y has the strongest oxidizing ability. Since Y is Cl2, and in the third period, the elements are Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl2, Ar. The oxidizing ability is highest for Cl2 because it's the most electronegative. For example, Cl2 can oxidize other halides like Br^- or I^-, but in the same period, compared to S, P, etc., Cl2 is the strongest oxidizing agent. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\nOption D: If the statement is saying that in the same period, there are elements with first ionization energy less than X (which is P), then yes, there are (Na, Mg, Al, Si, S). Therefore, the statement would be correct. However, if the option is phrased as \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\", then since X is P and Y is Cl, then yes, P's is less than Cl's. But since the option is about elements in the same period with first ionization energy less than X, and there are such elements, then D is correct. But the problem says that one of the options is incorrect. Since all A, B, C, D seem correct, but that can't be. There must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming Y is Cl. Let me check again the initial condition. The algebraic sum of highest positive and lowest negative valency of Y is 6. For Cl: highest positive oxidation state is +7, lowest negative is -1. Sum is 7 + (-1) = 6. Correct. For S: highest +6, lowest -2, sum 6 + (-2) = 4. For P: +5 and -3, sum 5 + (-3)=2. So only Cl fits. So Y is Cl. Then X is P because of the compound [PCl4]+[PCl6]^-.\n\nNow, let's check option D again. The original option D is written as: \"(D) In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\". If this is supposed to be a complete statement, maybe it's implying that there are no elements with first ionization energy less than X in the same period, which would be incorrect. But since there are elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, S) with lower ionization energy than P, then if the statement claims there are none, it would be incorrect. However, if the statement is simply stating that there are elements with first ionization energy less than X, then it's correct. The ambiguity here is critical.\n\nGiven that the problem is from a standardized test, likely the option is phrased as something like \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\" or similar. But given the translation provided, perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe the statement is saying that in the same period, there are elements with first ionization energy less than that of X, which is true, so D is correct. But since the problem says one option is incorrect, and we have to choose among A-D, and all others seem correct, maybe there's an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, let's check option D again. If the statement is \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\", maybe it's missing something. For example, if it's supposed to say \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X have higher metallic character\", but no. Alternatively, maybe the original statement is about the number of elements. For example, maybe the statement is \"In the same period, there are more elements with first ionization energy less than X than those with higher\", which would be true since there are 5 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, S) with lower and 2 (Cl, Ar) with higher. But the option as given doesn't specify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original statement is \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\", where Y is another element in the period. But since X is P and Y is Cl, then P's first ionization energy is less than Cl's. If the statement was about X having lower ionization energy than Y, then it's correct. But since the option D is not clearly stated, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. The Chinese might have said something like \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is less than that of Y\", which would be true because P (X) has 1012 and Cl (Y) has 1251. So if the statement was that X has lower ionization energy than Y, it's correct. But if the statement was claiming the opposite, it would be incorrect. Given the ambiguity, and since all other options seem correct, perhaps option D is the incorrect one. How?\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the statement in option D is \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\" implies that X has the lowest first ionization energy in the period, which is not true. Since there are elements with lower ionization energy than X (P), but X is not the one with the lowest. If the statement is claiming that X has the lowest ionization energy in the period, then it's incorrect. But the wording is unclear. If the statement is simply stating that there are elements with first ionization energy less than X, then it's correct. But if it's implying that X has the lowest, then it's incorrect. Given the ambiguity, but since the other options are correct, and the question states one is incorrect, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier analysis of the elements. Let me verify the compound again. The compound is [XY4]+[XY6]^-.\n\nIf X is P and Y is Cl, then [PCl4]+ and [PCl6]^- are correct. Yes, PCl5 can dissociate into these ions. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for option D: If the statement is \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\", and if the intended meaning is that X has a higher first ionization energy than all other elements in the period, which is not true because Cl and Ar have higher ionization energies than P. Wait, no, if the statement is about elements with first ionization energy less than X, then since there are elements with both lower and higher, the statement might be incomplete. For example, if the statement is \"In the same period, the number of elements with first ionization energy less than X is...\" but since it's not specified, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the problem's requirement to choose the incorrect statement, and considering that options A, B, C are correct, the only possibility is that option D is incorrect. Perhaps the original statement in option D is saying that in the same period, there are no elements with first ionization energy less than X, which is false. Or maybe it's saying something else. Given that I have to choose, and since all other options are correct, I will go with option D being the incorrect one.\n\nBut why? Let me think again. If the statement is \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\", and if it's supposed to be a complete statement, maybe it's saying that there are elements with first ionization energy less than X, which is true. So then D is correct. But since the question says one is incorrect, perhaps there is another mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the first ionization energy of P. Phosphorus has a higher first ionization energy than sulfur. Wait, earlier I said that S has 999 and P has 1012, so P has higher. Yes, that's correct. So in the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X (P) are Na, Mg, Al, Si, S. So five elements. Therefore, the statement \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\" is a true statement, assuming it's asserting their existence. Hence, if D is presented as a true statement, it's correct. But if the statement is claiming something else, like X has the lowest first ionization energy, which it doesn't, then it's incorrect. Given the ambiguity, but since all other options are correct, I might have made a mistake in another part.\n\nWait, let me check option B again. Reducing ability of simple hydrides: X > Y. X is PH3, Y is HCl. PH3 is a stronger reducing agent than HCl. For example, PH3 can reduce AgNO3 to Ag, while HCl does not. Also, in terms of thermal stability, less stable hydrides are better reducing agents. PH3 is less stable than HCl, so it's a better reducing agent. Hence, B is correct.\n\nOption C: Among the simple substances formed by elements of the same period, Y has the strongest oxidizing ability. Since Y is Cl2, and in the third period, Cl2 is the strongest oxidizing agent. Correct.\n\nOption A: Atomic radius X > Y. P has larger atomic radius than Cl. Correct.\n\nTherefore, all options A-D seem correct, but the problem says one is incorrect. This suggests I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the initial assumption about Y.\n\nWait, the algebraic sum of the highest positive and lowest negative valency of Y is 6. I assumed Y is Cl with +7 and -1, sum 6. But what if Y is sulfur? Wait, highest positive oxidation state for S is +6, lowest negative is -2, sum is 6 + (-2) = 4, not 6. Not matching. What about if Y is silicon? No, it's a metalloid. Highest positive for Si is +4, lowest negative is -4 (since it's in Group 14), sum 0. Not 6. What about P? Highest +5, lowest -3, sum 2. Not 6. Cl is the only one in third period that fits.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the valency is not oxidation state. Valency can sometimes be the absolute value. For example, highest positive valency is +7 for Cl, lowest negative valency is -1, so algebraic sum is +7 + (-1) = 6. Correct. But if valency is considered as absolute values, then it would be 7 + 1 = 8, but the question says algebraic sum, so signs matter. Hence, Y is Cl.\n\nSo X is P, Y is Cl. Now, let's think about option D again. Maybe the statement is saying \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X have higher electronegativity\", but no. Given the ambiguity, and since all other options are correct, I must have made a mistake in one of them.\n\nWait, option B: Reducing ability of simple hydrides: X > Y. PH3 vs HCl. PH3 is a weaker acid than HCl. In terms of reducing ability, PH3 is a stronger reducing agent. For example, in reactions with strong oxidizing agents, PH3 can act as a reducing agent, whereas HCl typically acts as an acid. Hence, statement B is correct.\n\nOption D: Maybe it's referring to first ionization energy of X being less than Y. Since X is P (1012) and Y is Cl (1251), P has lower ionization energy than Cl. If option D is saying that in the same period, there are elements with first ionization energy less than X, which is true, then it's correct. But if the option is saying that X has lower ionization energy than Y, which is true, then it's correct. But the option is phrased as \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\". If this is supposed to mean that X has the lowest first ionization energy in the period, which it doesn't, then it's incorrect. But since there are elements with lower ionization energy, the statement is correct if it's asserting their existence.\n\nGiven that I cannot find any incorrect statement among A, B, C, D based on my analysis, but the problem states one is incorrect, I must have an error. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, the question says \"the algebraic sum of the highest positive and lowest negative valency of Y is 6\". Valency is sometimes defined as the combining capacity, which is the absolute value. But the problem says \"algebraic sum\", which implies considering signs. So for Y, highest positive oxidation state + lowest negative oxidation state = 6. For Cl, +7 + (-1) = 6. Correct. For S, +6 + (-2) = 4. For P, +5 + (-3) = 2. So Y is Cl.\n\nNow, the compound [XY4]+[XY6]^- is [PCl4]+[PCl6]^-.\n\nNow, let's check the first ionization energies again. For third period:\n\nNa: 496, Mg: 738, Al: 578, Si: 786, P: 1012, S: 999, Cl: 1251, Ar: 1521.\n\nSo elements with first ionization energy less than P (1012) are Na, Al, Mg, Si, S. So five elements. If option D is saying that there are elements with first ionization energy less than X, which is true, then D is correct. If the statement is saying something else, like X has the lowest first ionization energy in the period, it's incorrect. But the wording is unclear.\n\nGiven the problem's requirement, and if I have to choose, perhaps the intended incorrect statement is D, assuming that the statement is claiming that X has a higher first ionization energy than all other elements in the period, which is not true because Cl and Ar have higher. But the statement is about elements with less, which is true. Therefore, I'm confused.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the statement in option D is \"In the same period, elements with first ionization energy less than X\" is incorrect because X is in the third period, and maybe there's a translation error. If the original statement was about the second ionization energy or something else, but no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the first ionization energy of X being less than that of Y, but since X is P and Y is Cl, P has lower ionization energy, so if the statement was \"In the same period, the first ionization energy of X is greater than that of Y\", it would be incorrect. But without knowing the exact wording, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that I have to make a decision, and since all other options are correct, I think the incorrect statement is D. Perhaps the original statement in D is saying that in the same period, there are no elements with first ionization energy less than X, which is false, making D the incorrect statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
