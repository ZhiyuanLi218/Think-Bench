Lithium-ion batteries, if improperly disposed of, can leach toxic metals and cause environmental harm. Recycling not only prevents pollution but also allows for the recovery of valuable metals like lithium, iron, and aluminum.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B**:  \n> **\"The metal elements that can be recovered from the 'cathode sheet' are $\\mathrm{Al}$, $\\mathrm{Fe}$, $\\mathrm{Li}$.\"**  \n\nThis is also **correct**. The cathode sheet in a lithium iron phosphate battery typically contains:\n- **Lithium (Li)** as part of the active material ($\\mathrm{LiFePO}_4$),\n- **Iron (Fe)** in the same compound,\n- **Aluminum (Al)** as the current collector.\n\nThese metals are commonly targeted for recovery in hydrometallurgical processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C**:  \n> **\"The metal ion in the 'precipitation' reaction is $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$.\"**  \n\nThis is **likely correct**. In many recovery processes involving $\\mathrm{LiFePO}_4$, the leaching step dissolves iron in the +2 oxidation state. However, to form a stable precipitate (e.g., $\\mathrm{Fe(OH)}_3$), iron is often oxidized to $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. The precipitation step often involves raising the pH to induce hydroxide formation, and this is typically done using a base like sodium carbonate. Therefore, the metal ion involved in the precipitation is indeed $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D**:  \n> **\"In the above process, sodium sulfate can be used instead of sodium carbonate.\"**  \n\nThis is the **incorrect** statement. **Sodium carbonate** is used in such processes because it is **basic** and helps to raise the pH of the solution, which is crucial for the **precipitation of metal hydroxides**, such as $\\mathrm{Fe(OH)}_3$ or $\\mathrm{Al(OH)}_3$. \n\nIn contrast, **sodium sulfate** is **neutral** and does **not significantly affect the pH**. Therefore, using sodium sulfate would not provide the necessary conditions for the precipitation of metal hydroxides, and thus **would not serve the same purpose** as sodium carbonate in the process.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final Answer:**  \n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{D}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which statement is incorrect based on the given information about the hydrometallurgical process for recovering metals from waste LiFePO4 battery cathode sheets.\n\nFirst, let me recall what I know about lithium iron phosphate batteries and their recycling processes. The cathode material is LiFePO4, and the cathode sheet would also contain other components, like the current collector, which is often aluminum. So the metals present might include Al, Fe, and Li. \n\nThe process mentioned is hydrometallurgical, which typically involves using aqueous solutions to recover metals. The steps mentioned are \"alkaline dissolution\" and then \"precipitation.\" So maybe the first step is dissolving certain metals in an alkaline solution, and then precipitating others.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A says proper disposal is good for the environment and recycling. That seems correct because battery waste can be harmful if not disposed of properly, so A is probably correct.\n\nOption B states that the recoverable metals are Al, Fe, Li. Given that the cathode material is LiFePO4, and the current collector is Al, these three metals should be recoverable. So B seems correct.\n\nOption C says the metal ion in the precipitation reaction is Fe³+. Now, I need to think about what happens during precipitation. If the process is alkaline dissolution first, maybe certain metals are dissolved, and others remain. For example, Al might dissolve in strong alkali, while Fe and Li might not. Then, in the precipitation step, perhaps Fe is precipitated. However, Fe in LiFePO4 is in +2 or +3 oxidation state? In LiFePO4, the formula is LiFePO4. Let's check oxidation states. Li is +1, P is +5, O is -2. So each O is -2, so 4 O's are -8. The total for Fe and P must balance with Li. The formula is LiFePO4. So total charge is 0. Li is +1, P is +5, O is -2*4= -8. So Fe's oxidation state is: +1 (Li) + Fe +5 (P) -8 (O) = 0. So Fe +1 +5 -8 = Fe -2 = 0 → Fe is +2. So Fe is in +2 oxidation state in LiFePO4. If during the process, Fe is being precipitated, maybe it's oxidized to Fe³+? For example, if Fe²+ is in solution and then oxidized to Fe³+ which can precipitate as Fe(OH)3. So if the precipitation reaction is for Fe³+, then option C is correct. But maybe in the process, Fe is not in +3? Let me think. If the dissolution is alkaline, maybe Al is dissolved as aluminate (AlO2^-), while Li and Fe might be leached out in acidic conditions. Wait, but the dissolution is alkaline. So maybe Li and Fe are not dissolved in the alkaline step. If the alkaline dissolution is to dissolve Al, then the remaining material would contain Li, Fe, P, etc. Then, perhaps in the next step, like leaching with acid, Li and Fe are dissolved, and then precipitation occurs. But the question mentions a \"precipitation\" reaction, and the metal ion there is Fe³+. So if Fe is in +2, but precipitated as Fe³+, then maybe there's an oxidation step. If the process does involve oxidizing Fe²+ to Fe³+ before precipitation, then option C is correct. If not, then maybe it's Fe²+. But the question states that option C says the metal ion is Fe³+. So if the precipitation step is for Fe³+, then C is correct. But I need to verify if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe during the process, Fe is in +3. For example, if the material is treated with an oxidizing agent, but the question doesn't mention that. The process is described as alkaline dissolution followed by precipitation. So perhaps after dissolving Al, the remaining material is treated with something else to dissolve Li and Fe. If they use an acid, maybe Fe is in +2. Then, when precipitating, maybe they oxidize it. But without more details, I need to rely on standard processes. In some recycling processes for LiFePO4, the leaching is done with sulfuric acid, and then Fe is precipitated as Fe(OH)3 by adjusting pH, which would require Fe³+. So if Fe is in +3 during precipitation, then C is correct. So maybe C is correct. But maybe the statement is incorrect? Wait, the question says \"The following statement is incorrect.\" So which one is wrong?\n\nOption D says sodium sulfate can be used instead of sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate is a common reagent in precipitation reactions, maybe to provide carbonate ions for precipitation. If sodium sulfate is used instead, would that work? Sodium carbonate is basic and can adjust pH, whereas sodium sulfate is neutral. If the precipitation step requires a certain pH, maybe sodium carbonate is needed to raise the pH to precipitate the metal hydroxide. Sodium sulfate wouldn't do that. For example, if you need to precipitate Fe(OH)3, you need a high pH, which sodium carbonate can help with by being a base. Sodium sulfate is neutral, so maybe it can't. Therefore, using sodium sulfate instead of sodium carbonate would not achieve the same result. Therefore, D is incorrect. So the incorrect statement is D.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If the process is using sodium carbonate for precipitation, perhaps to provide CO3^2- ions for a carbonate precipitate. If sodium sulfate is used, maybe sulfate ions are used for another type of precipitate. But for Fe, common precipitates are hydroxides or sulfates. If the intention is to precipitate Fe as hydroxide, then adding sodium carbonate would raise the pH via carbonate ions reacting with water to form OH- ions. Sodium sulfate wouldn't do that. So if the precipitation step relies on carbonate ions to adjust pH and precipitate Fe(OH)3, then using sodium sulfate instead would not work. Therefore, D is incorrect. So the incorrect statement is D.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n</think>"}
