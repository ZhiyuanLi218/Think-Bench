The problem gives me the length of the string, which is 31.6 cm, and the linear density is 0.65 g/m. The oscillator's frequency is changed from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, and the string vibrates at 880 Hz. Hmm, let me recall what I know about vibrating strings.\n\nFirst, I remember that the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string is given by the formula:\n\n$$ f = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nwhere:\n- $ f $ is the fundamental frequency,\n- $ L $ is the length of the string,\n- $ T $ is the tension in the string,\n- $ \\mu $ is the linear mass density.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't mention the tension $ T $. Hmm, maybe I need to find the tension first? But how? Let me check the given data again. The linear density is given as 0.65 g/m. Wait, grams per meter? That seems very light. Let me convert that to kg/m because standard SI units are kg, meters, seconds. So 0.65 g/m is 0.00065 kg/m. Let me note that down: $ \\mu = 0.00065 \\, \\text{kg/m} $.\n\nBut I still don't know the tension. However, maybe I don't need to find the tension directly. Since the string is vibrating at 880 Hz due to the loudspeaker, which is an external driving frequency, this is a case of resonance. When a string is driven at one of its natural frequencies, it resonates, and the mode of vibration depends on which harmonic is being excited.\n\nThe natural frequencies of a string fixed at both ends are given by:\n\n$$ f_n = n \\cdot f_1 $$\n\nwhere $ f_1 $ is the fundamental frequency, and $ n $ is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), representing the mode number. So, if I can find $ f_1 $, I can determine which harmonic $ n $ corresponds to 880 Hz.\n\nBut again, without knowing the tension, how can I find $ f_1 $? Maybe there's another way. Let me think. The problem says the oscillator's frequency is changed from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, and the string vibrates at 880 Hz. So 880 Hz must be one of the harmonics of the string. Therefore, if I can figure out the possible harmonics in that range, I can determine which one it is.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know the fundamental frequency. Wait, maybe I can express the harmonics in terms of the given parameters. Let me rearrange the formula for the fundamental frequency:\n\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nBut since I don't know $ T $, maybe I need another approach. Let me recall that when a string resonates with a driving frequency, the frequency must match one of its harmonics. So:\n\n$$ f_{\\text{driving}} = n \\cdot f_1 $$\n\nTherefore, if I can find $ n $, such that $ n = f_{\\text{driving}} / f_1 $, but again, without knowing $ f_1 $, this seems difficult. Wait, but maybe there is something else here. The problem gives me the length of the string and the linear density. Maybe I need to find the tension from another piece of information? But there isn't any other numerical data given. Wait, unless the fact that the string is a violin string implies something? Hmm, maybe not. I think I need to work with the given data.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express the possible harmonics in terms of the given frequency? Let me think. Let me write the general formula for the nth harmonic:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nBut since the string is vibrating at 880 Hz, that is:\n\n$$ 880 = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nBut without knowing $ T $, I can't solve for $ n $. However, maybe there's a way to relate this to the fundamental frequency? Let me think. If I consider that the fundamental frequency is:\n\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nTherefore, $ \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} = 2L f_1 $\n\nSubstituting back into the equation for $ f_n $:\n\n$$ 880 = \\frac{n}{2L} \\cdot 2L f_1 = n f_1 $$\n\nWhich just gives me the same equation as before: $ f_n = n f_1 $. Therefore, I need to find $ n $, but how?\n\nWait, maybe there is another piece of information here. The problem says that when the oscillator's frequency is changed from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, the string vibrates at 880 Hz. So, 880 Hz is within that range. Also, the string is a violin string, which typically has certain frequencies. But maybe I need to figure out the possible harmonics. However, without knowing the fundamental frequency, how?\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the fundamental frequency if I can find the tension? But there's no information about tension here. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the given linear density and length to find the fundamental frequency? But without tension, that's impossible. Wait, maybe the problem is missing some information? Or perhaps I need to realize that the string is vibrating in a particular mode when it resonates with the loudspeaker, and maybe there is another way.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use the fact that the string is vibrating at 880 Hz, which is a musical note (A above middle C). But I don't know if that helps here. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that the mode number is determined by the ratio of the given frequency to the fundamental frequency, but without knowing the fundamental frequency, how?\n\nWait, perhaps there is a way to relate the possible harmonics with the given data? Let me think. Suppose that the string is vibrating in the nth mode at 880 Hz. Then:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n v}{2L} $$\n\nwhere $ v $ is the wave speed on the string. The wave speed is given by:\n\n$$ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nBut again, without knowing $ T $, we can't find $ v $. However, perhaps we can express $ n $ in terms of $ v $:\n\n$$ n = \\frac{2L f_n}{v} $$\n\nBut since we don't know $ v $, this seems unhelpful. Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Let me think about the possible harmonics. If I can find the fundamental frequency, then I can divide 880 Hz by it to get $ n $. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the information that when the oscillator is varied from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, only 880 Hz causes resonance. Therefore, 880 Hz must be one of the harmonics of the string. So if I can find the fundamental frequency, then check which multiple of it is 880 Hz. However, without knowing the fundamental frequency, this is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the fundamental frequency in terms of the given parameters. Let me write down the formula again:\n\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nBut since we don't know $ T $, maybe there's a standard tension for violin strings? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that. Maybe the problem is missing some data? Wait, let me check the problem again.\n\n\"The length of a violin string is 31.6 cm, and the linear density is 0.65 g/m. The violin string is placed near a loudspeaker, which is driven by an audio oscillator with variable frequency. When the frequency of the oscillator is continuously changed from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, the violin string is found to vibrate at 880 Hz. What is the mode of vibration of the string at this frequency?\"\n\nWait, so they give me length, linear density, and the frequency at which resonance occurs. But not tension. Is there a way to find the mode without knowing the tension?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the fact that the string is vibrating at 880 Hz, and given the length and linear density, compute the possible mode. But how?\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula for the nth harmonic is:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for $ n $:\n\n$$ n = \\frac{2L f_n \\sqrt{\\mu}}{\\sqrt{T}} $$\n\nBut without knowing $ T $, I can't compute $ n $. Therefore, there must be something missing here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The frequency of the nth harmonic is:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n v}{2L} $$\n\nwhere $ v $ is the wave speed. And the wave speed is:\n\n$$ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nTherefore, combining them:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nSo, if I have two different frequencies, I can set up a ratio? But here I only have one frequency. Wait, but maybe the problem expects me to assume that 880 Hz is the fundamental? But 880 Hz is quite high for a fundamental frequency of a violin string. Wait, standard violin strings have A (which is 440 Hz) as the D string? Wait, actually, the A string on a violin is 440 Hz. The G string is lower, D string is middle D, and E string is higher. But this string's fundamental frequency would depend on its length, tension, and linear density. However, since we are not given the tension, maybe we need to find the mode?\n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. Let me consider that the problem is giving me the linear density in grams per meter. Let me check the units again. The length is 31.6 cm, which is 0.316 meters. The linear density is 0.65 g/m, which is 0.00065 kg/m. So, converting units properly.\n\nBut still, without tension, how to find the mode? Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the mode is determined by the frequency range? The oscillator is varied from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, and only 880 Hz causes resonance. Therefore, 880 Hz is a harmonic of the string. But how to find which harmonic?\n\nWait, maybe there's a standard tension for violin strings? For example, if I can find the typical tension of a violin string, then compute the fundamental frequency? But since this is a physics problem, maybe I need to use the given data to compute it? But how?\n\nWait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding here. Let me check the problem again. It says the linear density is 0.65 g/m. Wait, that seems extremely low. Let me check the units. 0.65 grams per meter is 0.00065 kg/m. Is that realistic? For a violin string? Let me recall that typical linear densities for violin strings are much higher. For example, a steel string might have a linear density on the order of grams per meter? Wait, maybe. For example, if a string is made of steel, with a diameter of, say, 0.3 mm, then the linear density would be:\n\nThe volume per meter is πr² * length, so π*(0.00015 m)^2 * 1 m ≈ 7.07e-8 m³. The density of steel is about 8000 kg/m³, so mass per meter is 7.07e-8 * 8000 ≈ 5.65e-4 kg/m = 0.565 g/m. Oh! So 0.65 g/m is actually reasonable for a steel violin string. So, okay, the linear density is given correctly.\n\nBut still, how do I find the tension? Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the fact that the string is vibrating at 880 Hz and that this is the nth harmonic, and use the formula for the nth harmonic to solve for n? But without knowing the tension, I need another equation. Wait, but maybe there is a way to relate it to the frequency range?\n\nWait, the oscillator is varied from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, and only at 880 Hz does the string resonate. Therefore, 880 Hz must be the only harmonic of the string in that frequency range. Therefore, if I can find the possible harmonics in that range, then 880 Hz must be one of them, and we can find n.\n\nBut how? Without knowing the fundamental frequency, how can I know which harmonics are in that range?\n\nWait, perhaps there's an assumption that the tension is such that the fundamental frequency is below 500 Hz? Or maybe that the string has only one harmonic in that range? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that the mode is determined by the frequency and the length, given the linear density? But without tension, I can't compute the wave speed.\n\nWait, this seems impossible. Maybe there is a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. The length is 31.6 cm, linear density is 0.65 g/m. The oscillator is varied from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, and the string vibrates at 880 Hz. What is the mode?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the formula for the nth harmonic and express n in terms of the given frequency, length, and linear density, assuming that the tension is such that only one harmonic is in that range? But how?\n\nLet me try writing the formula again:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nLet me rearrange for T:\n\n$$ T = \\mu \\left( \\frac{2L f_n}{n} \\right)^2 $$\n\nBut without knowing T, this is not helpful. Wait, but maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that the mode number n must be an integer, and given that the oscillator is swept from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, there is only one possible n such that 880 Hz is a harmonic. But how?\n\nWait, maybe if I assume that the fundamental frequency is such that when you multiply by n you get 880 Hz, and that n is an integer. Also, the fundamental frequency must be such that other harmonics are outside the 500-1500 Hz range. But how can I find n?\n\nWait, for example, if n=1, then the fundamental frequency would be 880 Hz. Then other harmonics would be 1760 Hz, 2640 Hz, etc. But since the oscillator only goes up to 1500 Hz, then only the first harmonic (880 Hz) is in the range. But is that possible? Then the mode would be n=1. But how do I know if the fundamental is 880 Hz?\n\nAlternatively, if n=2, then the fundamental frequency would be 440 Hz. Then the harmonics would be 440, 880, 1320, 1760... So in the range 500-1500, we would have 880 Hz and 1320 Hz. But the problem says that when the oscillator is swept, it vibrates at 880 Hz. Maybe there are two resonances? But the problem says \"the violin string is found to vibrate at 880 Hz\". Maybe only one resonance occurs in that range? If the fundamental is 440 Hz, then both 880 Hz and 1320 Hz would be in the range. However, the problem says that it vibrates at 880 Hz. Maybe there is only one resonance? Then perhaps the fundamental is such that only 880 Hz is in the range. For example, if the fundamental is between 500 Hz and 880 Hz / 2 = 440 Hz? Wait, no. If the fundamental is, say, 400 Hz, then harmonics would be 400, 800, 1200, 1600... So in the range 500-1500, there would be 800, 1200, 1600. So three harmonics. But the problem says only 880 Hz. So maybe the fundamental frequency is such that only one harmonic falls into the 500-1500 Hz range. But how can I determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to assume that the tension is such that the string is tuned to a specific note, but since we aren't given that, maybe not. Wait, but maybe there's a standard tension for violin strings? For example, if I can estimate the tension based on typical violin string tensions?\n\nLet me try that. Let me look up typical tension for violin strings. Wait, but since I can't actually look things up, I need to recall. For example, the tension in a violin string is typically around 50-70 Newtons? Let me check with some example calculations.\n\nSuppose the tension is, say, 50 N. Then, let's compute the fundamental frequency.\n\nGiven:\n\n- $ L = 0.316 $ m\n- $ \\mu = 0.00065 $ kg/m\n- $ T = 50 $ N (assumed)\n\nThen,\n\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} = \\frac{1}{2 * 0.316} * \\sqrt{50 / 0.00065} $$\n\nFirst compute $ \\sqrt{50 / 0.00065} $:\n\n50 / 0.00065 ≈ 50 / 0.00065 ≈ 76923.08\n\n√76923.08 ≈ 277.35 Hz\n\nThen divide by 2 * 0.316 ≈ 0.632\n\nSo f1 ≈ 277.35 / 0.632 ≈ 438.8 Hz ≈ 440 Hz. Oh! That's interesting. So if the tension is about 50 N, the fundamental frequency is approximately 440 Hz, which is the standard A note. So maybe this string is the A string of the violin, which is normally tuned to 440 Hz. Therefore, if the fundamental frequency is 440 Hz, then the harmonics are multiples of that. So the first harmonic (n=1) is 440 Hz, second harmonic (n=2) is 880 Hz, third harmonic (n=3) is 1320 Hz, fourth harmonic (n=4) is 1760 Hz, etc.\n\nGiven that the oscillator is swept from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, the harmonics in this range would be 880 Hz (n=2), 1320 Hz (n=3). But the problem says the string vibrates at 880 Hz. Maybe there are two resonances, but the problem specifically mentions 880 Hz. However, without more information, maybe we are to assume that it's the second harmonic, n=2? But why would the problem say \"the mode of vibration\" if there are multiple possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tension is different. Let's try with a different tension. Suppose the tension is higher. Let's say T=70 N.\n\nThen, compute sqrt(70 / 0.00065) ≈ sqrt(107692.3) ≈ 328.17 Hz\n\nThen f1 = 328.17 / 0.632 ≈ 519 Hz.\n\nSo fundamental frequency would be ~519 Hz. Then harmonics are 519, 1038, 1557, etc. In the range 500-1500 Hz, we have 519 Hz (n=1), 1038 Hz (n=2), 1557 Hz (n=3). But the problem says the resonance is at 880 Hz. So if the fundamental is ~519 Hz, then 880 Hz is not a harmonic. Therefore, this would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, suppose the tension is lower, say T=30 N.\n\nThen sqrt(30 / 0.00065) ≈ sqrt(46153.8) ≈ 214.8 Hz\n\nf1 = 214.8 / 0.632 ≈ 340 Hz. Then harmonics are 340, 680, 1020, 1360, 1700... In the 500-1500 range, we have 680, 1020, 1360. Still, 880 Hz is not a harmonic here. So none of these would give 880 Hz.\n\nBut earlier, with T=50 N, the fundamental is ~440 Hz, so harmonics are 440, 880, 1320... So in the 500-1500 range, 880 and 1320 Hz. The problem says the string vibrates at 880 Hz. It's possible that both 880 and 1320 are in the range, but the problem says \"is found to vibrate at 880 Hz\". Maybe the question is only asking about that specific frequency, which would be the second harmonic (n=2). So maybe the answer is n=2?\n\nBut how do I know that the tension is 50 N? Because I assumed that. But the problem didn't give me the tension. However, since the calculated fundamental frequency with T=50 N is 440 Hz, which is standard for a violin A string, and given that the length is 31.6 cm, which is reasonable for a violin string (violin strings are typically around 30-33 cm), it's plausible that this is the A string. Therefore, the mode would be the second harmonic, n=2.\n\nBut since the problem didn't give me the tension, I had to assume it based on typical values. Is there another way to do this without assuming the tension?\n\nWait, let's think again. The problem gives me linear density, length, and the frequency at which resonance occurs. If I can write the equation:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nLet me rearrange for n:\n\n$$ n = \\frac{2L f_n}{\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}} $$\n\nBut without knowing T, I can't find n. However, if I consider that the tension must be such that the fundamental frequency is a reasonable value for a violin string, then I can estimate n. Since we saw that with T=50 N, n=2 gives 880 Hz, which fits with the standard A string, maybe that's the intended approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to relate the given data without knowing the tension by considering the ratio of frequencies? But since only one frequency is given, I don't see how.\n\nWait, another thought. If the problem is from a textbook or standard problem set, maybe it's expecting the student to recognize that the given linear density is in grams per meter, which is very small, and that the length is in centimeters, so converting to meters is essential. Perhaps there is a calculation that I missed?\n\nLet me try plugging in the numbers again. Let me write down all the given values:\n\n- Length, L = 31.6 cm = 0.316 m\n- Linear density, μ = 0.65 g/m = 0.00065 kg/m\n- Frequency at resonance, f = 880 Hz\n- Need to find mode number, n.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nBut we need to find n. If I can express T in terms of something else... Wait, unless there is another condition? The problem says the string is placed near a loudspeaker, which is driven by an oscillator with variable frequency. When the frequency is changed from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, the string vibrates at 880 Hz. So maybe there is only one possible n for which this frequency is in the range? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a unique integer n such that when you compute f_n = n * f_1, and given that f_n = 880 Hz, and that other harmonics would be outside the 500-1500 Hz range. But without knowing f_1, how?\n\nWait, let me think about the possible values of n. Suppose that n is an integer. Let me assume that the fundamental frequency is such that when multiplied by n gives 880 Hz. Let me denote f_1 = 880 / n.\n\nNow, since the oscillator is swept from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, other harmonics would be at frequencies n*f_1. If n is such that (n-1)*f_1 is below 500 Hz and (n+1)*f_1 is above 1500 Hz, then only the nth harmonic would be in the range. But how can I determine n?\n\nFor example, let's suppose n=2. Then f_1 = 440 Hz. Then other harmonics are 440, 880, 1320, etc. So in the range 500-1500, we have 880 and 1320. So if n=2, then there is another harmonic (n=3, 1320 Hz) in the range. But the problem says that the string vibrates at 880 Hz. Maybe both 880 and 1320 would cause resonance, but the problem only mentions 880. Maybe the question is only asking about the specific frequency mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, if n=3, then f_1 ≈ 293 Hz. Then harmonics are 293, 586, 879, 1172, 1465, etc. In the 500-1500 range, we have 586, 879, 1172, 1465. So if the resonance is at 879 Hz ≈ 880 Hz, then n=3. But this would require f_1 ≈ 293 Hz.\n\nBut how can I know which one is correct? Without knowing the tension or the fundamental frequency, it's impossible to determine n uniquely. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my approach.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"What is the mode of vibration of the string at this frequency?\" Maybe the question is not asking for the harmonic number, but the mode, like whether it's the first harmonic (fundamental), second harmonic, etc. But without knowing the fundamental frequency, how can we know?\n\nWait, maybe I need to use the given data to calculate the wave speed? But no, because wave speed depends on tension. Wait, but if I assume that the string is vibrating in a certain mode, I can relate the frequency to the length and linear density? No, because wave speed is still unknown.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's suppose that the mode is n, so:\n\n$$ f_n = \\frac{n v}{2L} $$\n\nBut also, the wave speed is:\n\n$$ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nBut since we don't know T, we can't find v. However, if we consider that the tension in the string is the same as the tension required to have the string vibrate at 880 Hz in mode n, then maybe we can write:\n\n$$ T = \\mu \\left( \\frac{2L f_n}{n} \\right)^2 $$\n\nBut since we don't have T, this equation can't help us unless we have more information. However, maybe there is a constraint on T? For example, violin strings have a certain range of tensions. If we assume that T is within a typical range for violin strings, we can estimate n.\n\nEarlier, I assumed T=50 N and found n=2. Let me check what T would be for other n.\n\nFor example, suppose n=1 (fundamental mode):\n\n$$ T = \\mu (2L f_n / n)^2 = 0.00065 kg/m * (2 * 0.316 m * 880 Hz / 1)^2 $$\n\nCalculating inside:\n\n2 * 0.316 * 880 ≈ 0.632 * 880 ≈ 555.36\n\nThen squared: (555.36)^2 ≈ 308,423\n\nMultiply by μ: 0.00065 * 308,423 ≈ 200.47 N\n\nSo T ≈ 200 N for n=1. Is that a reasonable tension for a violin string? Earlier, I thought typical tension is around 50 N. 200 N seems very high. For example, if a violinist has a string with 200 N tension, that would be extremely tight. So maybe n=1 is unlikely.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nT = 0.00065 * (2 * 0.316 * 880 / 2)^2\n\nSimplify: 2L f_n / n = 2 * 0.316 * 880 / 2 = 0.316 * 880 ≈ 278.08\n\nThen squared: (278.08)^2 ≈ 77326\n\nMultiply by μ: 0.00065 * 77326 ≈ 50.26 N\n\nWhich is the 50 N we assumed earlier, which seems reasonable. So for n=2, T≈50 N, which is plausible.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nT = 0.00065 * (2 * 0.316 * 880 / 3)^2\n\nCalculate 2*0.316*880 ≈ 555.36 as before, divided by 3 ≈ 185.12\n\nSquared: (185.12)^2 ≈ 34,265\n\nMultiply by μ: 0.00065 * 34,265 ≈ 22.27 N\n\nThat's about 22 N, which is quite low for a violin string tension. Violin strings typically have tensions in the range of 40-70 N, so 22 N seems low. Therefore, n=3 would imply a very low tension, which is less likely.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nT = 0.00065 * (2 * 0.316 * 880 / 4)^2\n\nCalculate 555.36 / 4 ≈ 138.84\n\nSquared: ≈ 19,277\n\nMultiply by μ: 0.00065 * 19,277 ≈ 12.53 N, which is even lower.\n\nTherefore, based on typical violin string tensions, n=2 with T≈50 N is the most plausible. Therefore, the mode of vibration is the second harmonic, which corresponds to n=2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the second harmonic, so the mode is n=2, which is the second mode or the first overtone.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check what the fundamental frequency would be for n=2 case. If T=50 N, then:\n\nf1 = 1/(2L) * sqrt(T/μ) = 1/(2*0.316) * sqrt(50 / 0.00065) ≈ 1/0.632 * 277.35 ≈ 438.8 Hz ≈ 440 Hz, which is standard for the A string. So, yes, this makes sense. When the A string is driven at 880 Hz, which is the second harmonic, it resonates. This is the octave above the A note.\n\nTherefore, the mode is the second harmonic, which is n=2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mode of vibration of the string at 880 Hz is the \\boxed{2}nd harmonic.\n</think>"}
