Let me start by visualizing the problem. There's a cylinder with radius r rolling without slipping on a plane. The axis of the cylinder, point O, is moving with a constant velocity v₀. Attached to the edge of the cylinder is a rectangular plate of length l. One edge, B, is hinged to the cylinder, and the other end, A, is resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder. At time t=0, the angle φ is zero. I need to write the kinematic equations of the AB plate using point B as the reference.\n\nFirst, since the cylinder is rolling without slipping, the velocity of the cylinder's axis O is v₀, which should be related to its angular velocity. For rolling without slipping, the velocity of the center is related to the angular velocity ω by v₀ = ωr. So maybe I can express angular velocity in terms of v₀ and r, which is ω = v₀ / r. That might come into play later.\n\nNow, the plate AB is hinged at point B, which is on the edge of the cylinder. So as the cylinder rolls, point B moves along a cycloid path? Wait, no. Wait, when a cylinder rolls without slipping, a point on the edge has a cycloidal trajectory. But since the plate is hinged at B, the motion of point B is important here. However, since the plate is connected to the cylinder, maybe I need to consider the rotation of the plate relative to the cylinder?\n\nBut the problem says to take B as the reference point. So maybe we need to describe the motion of point A relative to point B? The kinematic equations would probably involve position, velocity, and acceleration of points on AB, but since it's a rigid body, maybe we need to describe its angular position, velocity, and acceleration?\n\nGiven that φ is the angle at time t, starting at zero. So φ(t) is the angle of the plate AB with respect to some reference line. Since the cylinder is rolling, and the plate is connected to it, φ(t) is likely related to the rotation of the cylinder and the movement of point A.\n\nLet me think about the coordinates. Let's assume the plane is the horizontal plane, and the cylinder is rolling to the right. Let me set up a coordinate system with origin at some fixed point, but since the cylinder is moving with constant velocity, maybe it's easier to use a moving coordinate system attached to the cylinder's axis O? Or maybe not. Alternatively, since the problem mentions taking B as a reference point, perhaps we need to use coordinates relative to B?\n\nBut kinematic equations usually require absolute positions. Wait, the question says \"write the kinematic equations of the AB plate.\" So maybe they want the position, velocity, and acceleration of points on the plate, or perhaps the angular position, velocity, and acceleration?\n\nSince the plate is hinged at B, which is moving, and the other end A is moving with the cylinder. Let me try to figure out how the angle φ(t) evolves.\n\nAt t=0, φ=0. Let me imagine the cylinder rolling forward. As it rolls, point B moves along the cycloid path, but since the plate AB is hinged at B and the other end A is on the plane, the plate must be rotating as the cylinder rolls. Let me try to find φ(t).\n\nLet me consider the position of point A. Since it's resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder, its velocity should be equal to the velocity of the plane? Wait, the plane is stationary, but point A is moving with the cylinder? Wait, no. Wait, if the cylinder is rolling on the plane, the plane is stationary. But point A is resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder. That suggests that point A is instantaneously at rest relative to the plane? But if the cylinder is rolling without slipping, the point on the cylinder in contact with the plane is instantaneously at rest. However, point A is not on the cylinder; it's on the plate. So maybe point A is always in contact with the plane and moving with velocity v₀? Wait, if the cylinder is moving with velocity v₀, then if point A is moving with the cylinder, its velocity should also be v₀. But since it's in contact with the plane, which is stationary, that would mean there's slipping unless v₀ is zero. But that can't be. Therefore, maybe point A is instantaneously at rest relative to the plane, similar to the contact point of the cylinder?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the other end, edge A, resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder.\" So maybe there's no slipping at point A? But how? If the plate is connected to the cylinder, as the cylinder rolls, point B moves, and point A must adjust its position on the plane. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let me denote the position of the cylinder's axis O at time t as x_O(t) = v₀ t. Since it's rolling without slipping, the rotation angle of the cylinder θ(t) is related to x_O(t) by θ(t) = (v₀ / r) t. Because for rolling without slipping, the arc length rolled out is equal to the distance moved, so θ(t) * r = x_O(t) => θ(t) = x_O(t)/r = v₀ t / r.\n\nNow, point B is on the edge of the cylinder. Let me find its coordinates. In the coordinate system where the plane is the x-axis, and the cylinder is rolling along the x-axis. At time t, the center O is at (v₀ t, r). The position of point B, which is on the edge of the cylinder, depends on the rotation angle θ(t). Since the cylinder has rotated by θ(t) = v₀ t / r, point B, which is initially at the top of the cylinder at t=0, would have coordinates relative to O as (r cos θ(t), r sin θ(t))? Wait, if θ(t) is the angle of rotation of the cylinder, then if at t=0, the cylinder is such that point B is at the top, then as it rolls, point B would move clockwise? Assuming the cylinder rolls to the right.\n\nBut actually, the standard cycloid parametric equations are x = r(θ - sin θ), y = r(1 - cos θ), but that's for a point on the rim. Wait, no, if θ is the angle of rotation, then the absolute position of point B would be the position of the center plus the vector from the center to the point on the rim. However, since the cylinder is rolling to the right, the rotation is clockwise. Therefore, if the center is at (v₀ t, r), then the coordinates of point B would be:\n\nx_B = x_O - r sin θ(t)\n\ny_B = r + r cos θ(t)\n\nWait, let me think. If the cylinder rotates clockwise by angle θ, then the coordinates of a point on the rim relative to the center would be (-r sin θ, -r cos θ + r)? Wait, if θ is measured from the downward vertical? Hmm, perhaps I need to be more precise.\n\nLet me consider θ(t) as the angle between the upward vertical and the line from the center O to point B, measured clockwise. At t=0, θ(0) = 0, so point B is at the top of the cylinder, coordinates relative to O would be (0, r). As the cylinder rolls to the right, θ(t) increases clockwise. Therefore, the coordinates of point B relative to O are (r sin θ(t), - r cos θ(t)). Therefore, absolute coordinates of point B are:\n\nx_B = x_O + r sin θ(t) = v₀ t + r sin θ(t)\n\ny_B = r - r cos θ(t)\n\nBut θ(t) is equal to the rotation angle of the cylinder. Since it's rolling without slipping, θ(t) = x_O(t)/r = (v₀ t)/r. Therefore:\n\nx_B = v₀ t + r sin(v₀ t / r)\n\ny_B = r - r cos(v₀ t / r)\n\nBut let me check this. For a standard cycloid, the parametric equations are x = r(θ - sin θ), y = r(1 - cos θ). But here, x_B is v₀ t + r sin θ(t). Since θ(t) = v₀ t / r, so substituting:\n\nx_B = v₀ t + r sin(v₀ t / r) = r(v₀ t / r) + r sin(v₀ t / r) = r θ(t) + r sin θ(t) = r(θ(t) + sin θ(t))\n\nBut standard cycloid is x = r(θ - sin θ). So this seems different. Wait, maybe I have the direction of θ wrong. If θ is the rotation angle of the cylinder, then if the cylinder rolls to the right, the rotation is clockwise. However, in the standard cycloid, θ is typically measured as the angle through which the circle has rolled, which for a counterclockwise rotation would correspond to the standard parametrization. So perhaps my sign is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to define θ(t) as the angle rotated counterclockwise. Let me think again. If the cylinder rolls to the right without slipping, then the rotation is clockwise. So if I define θ(t) as positive clockwise, then θ(t) = v₀ t / r. But in standard math, angles are usually measured counterclockwise. Maybe this is causing confusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use θ(t) as the angle of rotation of the cylinder in the counterclockwise direction, which would be negative if rolling to the right. However, since the relationship between translation and rotation for rolling without slipping is that the arc length is equal to the distance rolled, regardless of direction. So θ(t) = x_O(t)/r, but with sign depending on direction. Since it's rolling to the right, θ(t) would be clockwise, so if we take θ(t) as positive clockwise, then yes, θ(t) = v₀ t / r.\n\nBut regardless, the position of point B is following a cycloid. However, in this case, since the cylinder is moving to the right with velocity v₀, and rotating clockwise, point B's coordinates are as I derived before:\n\nx_B = v₀ t + r sin θ(t)\n\ny_B = r - r cos θ(t)\n\nBut θ(t) = v₀ t / r. Therefore:\n\nx_B = v₀ t + r sin(v₀ t / r)\n\ny_B = r - r cos(v₀ t / r)\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the plate AB is hinged at B, and the other end A is resting on the plane. So point A is on the plane, so its y-coordinate is zero. Let me denote the coordinates of A as (x_A, 0). Since AB is a rigid plate of length l, the distance between A and B must be l. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - 0)^2 = l²\n\nSo:\n\n(x_B - x_A)^2 + y_B² = l²\n\nTherefore, solving for x_A:\n\nx_A = x_B ± sqrt(l² - y_B²)\n\nBut since the plate is connected such that A is resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder, we need to figure out the correct sign. Since the cylinder is rolling to the right, and assuming the plate is initially horizontal at t=0 (φ=0), then at t=0, point B is at (0, r) relative to O, but O is at (0, r). Wait, no. Wait, at t=0, x_O(0) = 0, θ(0) = 0. Therefore, x_B(0) = 0 + r sin(0) = 0, y_B(0) = r - r cos(0) = r - r(1) = 0? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if θ(t) = v₀ t / r, then at t=0, θ(0)=0. Therefore, x_B(0) = 0 + r sin(0) = 0, y_B(0) = r - r cos(0) = r - r = 0. Wait, but that would mean at t=0, point B is at (0, 0), which is the contact point of the cylinder with the plane. But the problem says φ=0 at t=0, with B as a reference. Maybe my coordinate system is off.\n\nWait, maybe my earlier assumption about the coordinates of point B is wrong. Let me re-examine.\n\nIf the cylinder is rolling without slipping, and O is the center at (v₀ t, r). Let me consider a point B on the edge of the cylinder. The position of B depends on the rotation. If at t=0, the cylinder is such that point B is at the top of the cylinder, then as it rolls forward, point B will trace a cycloid.\n\nBut in standard cycloid equations, the parametric equations are:\n\nx = r(θ - sin θ)\n\ny = r(1 - cos θ)\n\nWhere θ is the angle of rotation. However, in this case, the center of the cylinder is moving to the right with velocity v₀, so the position of the center is x_O = v₀ t. For rolling without slipping, θ = x_O / r = v₀ t / r. Therefore, substituting into the cycloid equations:\n\nx_B = r(θ - sin θ) = r(v₀ t / r - sin(v₀ t / r)) = v₀ t - r sin(v₀ t / r)\n\ny_B = r(1 - cos θ) = r(1 - cos(v₀ t / r))\n\nAh! So previously, I had the sign wrong on the sine term. So my earlier equations for x_B were incorrect. The correct coordinates of point B, following a cycloid, are:\n\nx_B = v₀ t - r sin(v₀ t / r)\n\ny_B = r(1 - cos(v₀ t / r))\n\nTherefore, at t=0, x_B = 0 - 0 = 0, y_B = 0. So point B is at the contact point at t=0? But the problem states that φ=0 at t=0. If φ is the angle of the plate AB, then perhaps at t=0, the plate is horizontal? But if point B is at (0, 0) at t=0, and point A is also on the plane, then if AB is horizontal, point A would be at ( - l, 0). But the cylinder is moving to the right, so maybe the plate is attached on the right side? Wait, maybe my initial assumption about where point B is located is wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says \"edge B is hinged to the edge of the cylinder\". Maybe at t=0, point B is at the top of the cylinder? Let me think again. If φ=0 at t=0, perhaps the plate AB is horizontal, with B at the top of the cylinder and A touching the plane. In that case, at t=0, the coordinates of B would be (x_O, 2r)? No, because the cylinder has radius r, so the top of the cylinder is at (x_O, 2r). But if the center is at (x_O, r), then the top is at (x_O, r + r) = (x_O, 2r). Therefore, if at t=0, point B is at the top of the cylinder, then x_B(0) = x_O(0) = 0, y_B(0) = 2r. But according to the cycloid equations, at t=0, x_B = 0, y_B = 0. Therefore, there is a discrepancy here.\n\nThis suggests that my parametrization of point B is incorrect if we want it to start at the top of the cylinder. Therefore, perhaps I need to adjust the parametrization. Let me consider that point B is not the point in contact with the plane, but a different point on the edge of the cylinder. If at t=0, point B is at the top of the cylinder, then as the cylinder rolls, it will trace a different cycloid.\n\nActually, the general equation for a cycloid depends on where the point is on the circle. If the point is on the rim, but not the contact point, then it's still a cycloid, but if it's at the top, then at t=0, it's at (0, 2r). However, according to the standard parametric equations, if θ is the angle of rotation, then the position relative to the center is (r sin θ, - r cos θ). If θ=0, that would be (0, -r), which is the bottom of the circle. Therefore, if we want point B to be at the top of the cylinder at θ=0, we need to adjust the parametrization. For example, if θ is measured from the downward vertical, then to have the point at the top, we need θ = π. Therefore, maybe my earlier definition of θ is conflicting with the initial condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to define θ such that at t=0, point B is at the top. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define θ(t) as the angle between the upward vertical and the line from the center O to point B, measured clockwise. At t=0, θ(0) = 0°, so point B is at the top. As the cylinder rolls clockwise (to the right), θ(t) increases. Then, the coordinates of point B relative to O would be:\n\nx'_B = r sin θ(t)\n\ny'_B = r cos θ(t) - r\n\nWait, if θ is measured clockwise from the upward vertical, then:\n\nIf θ=0, then relative to O, the coordinates are (0, r - r) = (0, 0)? No, wait. If θ is measured from upward vertical, then when θ=0, point B is at the top, which is (0, r) relative to O. If θ increases clockwise, then for θ, the coordinates relative to O would be:\n\nx'_B = r sin θ(t)\n\ny'_B = r cos θ(t)\n\nBut then adding the center coordinates:\n\nx_B = x_O + x'_B = v₀ t + r sin θ(t)\n\ny_B = r + y'_B = r + r cos θ(t)\n\nBut then, for rolling without slipping, θ(t) is related to the rotation of the cylinder. Since the cylinder is rolling to the right, the rotation is clockwise, so θ(t) = ω t = (v₀ / r) t. Therefore, substituting:\n\nx_B = v₀ t + r sin(v₀ t / r)\n\ny_B = r + r cos(v₀ t / r)\n\nAt t=0, this gives x_B = 0 + 0 = 0, y_B = r + r(1) = 2r? No, cos(0) is 1, so y_B = r + r*1 = 2r. Yes! So at t=0, point B is at (0, 2r), which is the top of the cylinder. Perfect. Therefore, this is the correct parametrization. Earlier confusion was due to different definitions of θ. So now, the coordinates of point B are:\n\nx_B(t) = v₀ t + r sin(φ(t)) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait θ(t) = v₀ t / r. Therefore, φ(t) is the angle of the plate AB. Wait, but the problem says φ=0 at t=0, taking B as a reference. So perhaps φ(t) is the angle between the plate AB and some reference line, maybe the vertical or horizontal?\n\nThe problem says \"taking B as a reference point\", so maybe we need to express the kinematic equations of the plate AB with respect to point B. Since AB is a rigid body, its motion can be described by the angular position φ(t), angular velocity, angular acceleration, and the position of point A relative to B.\n\nGiven that, perhaps φ(t) is the angle between the plate AB and the vertical line passing through B? Or maybe the horizontal? The problem doesn't specify, but since φ=0 at t=0, and at t=0, if the plate is horizontal (assuming A is on the plane and B is at the top), then φ=0 would correspond to AB being horizontal. Let me assume that φ(t) is the angle between AB and the horizontal line. At t=0, φ=0, meaning AB is horizontal.\n\nGiven that, we need to find φ(t) as a function of time, and then write the kinematic equations. Since point A is on the plane, its y-coordinate is zero. Let me denote the coordinates of A as (x_A(t), 0). The distance between A and B must be l:\n\n(x_B(t) - x_A(t))² + (y_B(t) - 0)² = l²\n\nTherefore:\n\n(x_A(t)) = x_B(t) ± √[l² - y_B(t)²]\n\nBut since the plate is attached such that A is moving with the cylinder, we need to figure out the correct sign. At t=0, point B is at (0, 2r), and if AB is horizontal, then point A is to the left or right of B? If the cylinder is rolling to the right, and the plate is horizontal with A on the plane, then since B is at (0, 2r) at t=0, A must be directly below B on the plane, which would be at (0, 0). But the length of AB is l, so the distance between (0, 2r) and (0, 0) is 2r. Therefore, l must be equal to 2r? But the problem says the plate has length l. Therefore, unless l = 2r, this would not hold. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my assumption.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the other end, edge A, resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder.\" So at t=0, point A is on the plane, moving with the cylinder. Since the cylinder's velocity is v₀ to the right, point A must also be moving to the right with velocity v₀. But if at t=0, point A is directly below B at (0, 0), then as the cylinder starts rolling, point B moves to the right and down, while point A must move to the right with velocity v₀. Therefore, the plate AB must be rotating as the cylinder rolls.\n\nBut if l is arbitrary, not necessarily 2r, then the position of A is not directly below B unless l = 2r. Therefore, my previous assumption that AB is horizontal at t=0 with A directly below B is only valid if l = 2r. However, the problem states a general length l. Therefore, perhaps at t=0, the plate AB is not horizontal, but makes some angle φ=0 with respect to a certain reference. The problem says φ=0 at t=0, taking B as a reference. Maybe φ is the angle between AB and the vertical line through B? If at t=0, φ=0, then AB is vertical. But then point A would be at (0, 2r - l), but since it's resting on the plane, 2r - l = 0 => l = 2r again. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there is a specific relationship between l and r? Or maybe my entire approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps φ(t) is the angle between AB and the tangent to the cycloid at point B? Not sure. Let me try again.\n\nGiven that AB is a rigid plate of length l, hinged at B (which is moving along a cycloid), and point A is on the plane. Therefore, the position of A is constrained to the plane (y=0), and the distance between A and B is always l. Therefore, for any position of B, point A lies at the intersection of the plane y=0 and a circle of radius l centered at B.\n\nTherefore, mathematically, given B(t) = (x_B(t), y_B(t)), then A(t) = (x_A(t), 0) where:\n\n(x_A(t) - x_B(t))² + (0 - y_B(t))² = l² => x_A(t) = x_B(t) ± √(l² - y_B(t)²)\n\nTherefore, there are two possible positions for A, symmetric with respect to B's projection on the plane. Given that the plate is moving with the cylinder, we need to determine which sign to take. At t=0, if φ=0, we need to figure out which sign corresponds to the plate being in a certain orientation.\n\nAt t=0, x_B(0) = 0, y_B(0) = r + r cos(0) = r + r = 2r. Therefore, x_A(0) = 0 ± √(l² - (2r)^2). For real solutions, we need l ≥ 2r. Assuming l ≥ 2r, then at t=0, x_A(0) is either 0 + √(l² - 4r²) or 0 - √(l² - 4r²). If we take the negative sign, x_A(0) is to the left of B, and if we take the positive sign, to the right. Since the cylinder is rolling to the right, and the plate is attached such that A is moving with the cylinder, likely the plate is on the side where A moves with the cylinder, so maybe the correct sign is such that as the cylinder rolls, A moves to the right. At t=0, if we take x_A(0) = -√(l² - 4r²), then as the cylinder rolls to the right, point A would have to move right to stay under the plate. Alternatively, if we take the positive sign, x_A(0) is to the right, but as the cylinder rolls further right, maybe the plate would have to swing down. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that l = 2r? If so, then at t=0, x_A(0) = 0 ± 0 => x_A(0)=0. Therefore, point A is at (0, 0), directly below B at (0, 2r). Then as the cylinder rolls, point B moves along the cycloid, and point A moves along the plane. For l = 2r, this would make sense. However, the problem states a general length l. Maybe it's safe to assume l ≥ 2r? Or perhaps there's another way to define φ(t).\n\nAlternatively, maybe φ(t) is the angle between AB and the vertical line through B. At t=0, if AB is vertical (φ=0), then point A is at (0, 2r - l). For A to be on the plane, 2r - l = 0 => l=2r again. So again, maybe the problem assumes l=2r? But since it's given as a general length l, perhaps not. Maybe I need to proceed with the general case.\n\nLet me proceed with the general case. So we have:\n\nx_A(t) = x_B(t) ± √(l² - y_B(t)²)\n\nGiven that, and knowing x_B(t) and y_B(t), we can write x_A(t). Then, since AB is a rigid body hinged at B, its angular position φ(t) can be determined based on the position of A.\n\nLet me define φ(t) as the angle between AB and the vertical line passing through B. Then, tan φ(t) would be the horizontal distance between A and B divided by the vertical distance between A and B. The vertical distance between A and B is y_B(t) - 0 = y_B(t). The horizontal distance is |x_A(t) - x_B(t)|. Therefore:\n\ntan φ(t) = |x_A(t) - x_B(t)| / y_B(t)\n\nBut since we have x_A(t) - x_B(t) = ±√(l² - y_B(t)^2), then tan φ(t) = √(l² - y_B(t)^2)/y_B(t). Therefore:\n\ntan φ(t) = √(l² - y_B(t)^2)/y_B(t)\n\nWhich simplifies to tan φ(t) = √( (l/y_B(t))² - 1 )\n\nAlternatively, since AB has length l, and the vertical distance from B to A is y_B(t), then the angle φ(t) satisfies:\n\nsin φ(t) = horizontal distance / l = √(l² - y_B(t)^2)/l => sin φ(t) = √(1 - (y_B(t)/l)^2 )\n\nTherefore:\n\nφ(t) = arcsin( √(1 - (y_B(t)/l)^2 ) )\n\nBut y_B(t) = r + r cos(θ(t)) = r(1 + cos(θ(t))) where θ(t) = v₀ t / r.\n\nTherefore:\n\nφ(t) = arcsin( √(1 - [ r(1 + cos(v₀ t / r)) / l ]² ) )\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can simplify it. Let me compute y_B(t):\n\ny_B(t) = r(1 + cos(θ(t))) = r(1 + cos(v₀ t / r))\n\nTherefore:\n\nφ(t) = arcsin( √(1 - [ r(1 + cos(v₀ t / r)) / l ]² ) )\n\nThis is an expression for φ(t). However, this seems quite complex, and I need to write the kinematic equations of the AB plate. Perhaps there is a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is a rigid body rotating about point B, its angular velocity can be found by differentiating φ(t). But first, we need φ(t) as a function of time.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the coordinates of A and B, we can find the angular velocity of AB by considering the velocity of point A relative to point B.\n\nSince AB is a rigid body, the velocity of A is equal to the velocity of B plus the angular velocity of AB crossed with the vector from B to A.\n\nLet me denote ω_AB as the angular velocity of the plate AB. Then:\n\nv_A = v_B + ω_AB × r_{BA}\n\nWhere r_{BA} is the vector from B to A.\n\nSince point A is on the plane, its velocity v_A has only horizontal component (since it's moving with the cylinder, which has velocity v₀). Wait, earlier we had confusion about whether point A is moving with velocity v₀ or is instantaneously at rest. The problem states \"the other end, edge A, resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder.\" Therefore, \"moving with the cylinder\" suggests that point A has velocity v₀. Therefore, v_A = (v₀, 0).\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nv_A = v_B + ω_AB × r_{BA}\n\nLet me compute v_B first. The velocity of point B is the derivative of its position:\n\nv_B(t) = d/dt [x_B(t), y_B(t)] = [v₀ + r*(v₀ / r) cos(v₀ t / r), 0 + r*(v₀ / r) sin(v₀ t / r)]\n\nSimplify:\n\nv_B(t) = [v₀ + v₀ cos(φ_angle), v₀ sin(φ_angle)]\n\nWait, θ(t) = v₀ t / r, so:\n\nv_B(t) = [v₀ + v₀ cos(θ(t)), v₀ sin(θ(t))]\n\nYes, because derivative of x_B(t) = v₀ t + r sin(θ(t)) is v₀ + r*(dθ/dt) cos(θ(t)) = v₀ + v₀ cos(θ(t)), since dθ/dt = v₀ / r.\n\nSimilarly, derivative of y_B(t) = r + r cos(θ(t)) is -r*(dθ/dt) sin(θ(t)) = -v₀ sin(θ(t)).\n\nWait, hold on:\n\nWait y_B(t) = r + r cos(θ(t)), so dy_B/dt = -r sin(θ(t)) * dθ/dt = -r sin(θ(t)) * (v₀ / r) = -v₀ sin(θ(t)). Therefore, velocity of B is:\n\nv_B(t) = [v₀ + v₀ cos(θ(t)), -v₀ sin(θ(t))]\n\nWait earlier I had the y-component as positive, but it's actually negative? Let me check:\n\nOriginal y_B(t) = r(1 + cos(θ(t))). Therefore, derivative is -r sin(θ(t)) * dθ/dt = -v₀ sin(θ(t)). Yes, correct. So velocity of B is:\n\nv_Bx = v₀ + v₀ cos(θ(t))\n\nv_By = -v₀ sin(θ(t))\n\nNow, vector from B to A is r_{BA} = (x_A - x_B, 0 - y_B). Let me denote this as (Δx, Δy) = (x_A - x_B, - y_B). The angular velocity ω_AB is a scalar (since it's 2D motion) and the cross product in 2D becomes ω_AB * ( -Δy, Δx ). Because ω_AB × r_{BA} would be a vector perpendicular to the plane, but since we're in 2D, the effect on velocity is:\n\nIf ω_AB is the angular velocity (positive counterclockwise), then the velocity due to rotation is ω_AB × r_{BA} = ( -ω_AB * Δy, ω_AB * Δx )\n\nTherefore, the equation v_A = v_B + ω_AB × r_{BA} becomes:\n\n(v₀, 0) = (v₀ + v₀ cos θ, -v₀ sin θ) + ( -ω_AB * (-y_B), ω_AB * (x_A - x_B) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(v₀, 0) = (v₀ + v₀ cos θ, -v₀ sin θ) + ( ω_AB y_B, ω_AB (x_A - x_B) )\n\nTherefore, equating components:\n\nFor x-component:\n\nv₀ = v₀ + v₀ cos θ + ω_AB y_B\n\n=> 0 = v₀ cos θ + ω_AB y_B\n\n=> ω_AB = -v₀ cos θ / y_B\n\nFor y-component:\n\n0 = -v₀ sin θ + ω_AB (x_A - x_B)\n\nBut from earlier, we have (x_A - x_B)^2 + y_B^2 = l^2 => x_A - x_B = ±√(l² - y_B²). Let's denote this as Δx = ±√(l² - y_B²). Therefore:\n\n0 = -v₀ sin θ + ω_AB * Δx\n\nSubstitute ω_AB from x-component:\n\n0 = -v₀ sin θ + [ -v₀ cos θ / y_B ] * Δx\n\n=> v₀ sin θ = - [ -v₀ cos θ / y_B ] * Δx\n\nWait:\n\nWait 0 = -v₀ sin θ + ω_AB * Δx => ω_AB * Δx = v₀ sin θ\n\nBut ω_AB = -v₀ cos θ / y_B, so:\n\n(-v₀ cos θ / y_B) * Δx = v₀ sin θ\n\n=> -cos θ * Δx / y_B = sin θ\n\n=> Δx = - y_B tan θ\n\nBut Δx = ±√(l² - y_B²). Therefore:\n\n±√(l² - y_B²) = - y_B tan θ\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nl² - y_B² = y_B² tan² θ\n\n=> l² = y_B² (1 + tan² θ) = y_B² sec² θ\n\n=> l = y_B sec θ\n\n=> y_B = l cos θ\n\nBut y_B = r(1 + cos θ), so:\n\nr(1 + cos θ) = l cos θ\n\n=> r + r cos θ = l cos θ\n\n=> r = (l - r) cos θ\n\n=> cos θ = r / (l - r)\n\nWait, this suggests that cos θ is a constant, which would mean θ is constant, but θ(t) = v₀ t / r, which varies with time. This is a contradiction unless l is chosen such that this holds for all t, which is impossible unless l is infinite or something. This suggests that there is a mistake in my derivation.\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nStarting from the y-component equation:\n\n0 = -v₀ sin θ + ω_AB * Δx\n\nWe had from x-component:\n\nω_AB = -v₀ cos θ / y_B\n\nSubstituting into y-component:\n\n0 = -v₀ sin θ + (-v₀ cos θ / y_B) * Δx\n\n=> v₀ sin θ = - (-v₀ cos θ / y_B) * Δx ?\n\nWait no:\n\nOriginal equation is:\n\n0 = -v₀ sin θ + ω_AB * Δx\n\nSubstituting ω_AB:\n\n0 = -v₀ sin θ + [ -v₀ cos θ / y_B ] * Δx\n\n=> v₀ sin θ = - [ -v₀ cos θ / y_B ] * Δx ?\n\nWait no:\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n[ -v₀ cos θ / y_B ] * Δx = v₀ sin θ\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n[ v₀ cos θ / y_B ] * Δx = -v₀ sin θ\n\nDivide both sides by v₀:\n\n[ cos θ / y_B ] * Δx = -sin θ\n\n=> Δx = - y_B sin θ / cos θ = - y_B tan θ\n\nWhich is what I had earlier. Then, since Δx = ±√(l² - y_B²):\n\n±√(l² - y_B²) = - y_B tan θ\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nl² - y_B² = y_B² tan² θ\n\n=> l² = y_B² (1 + tan² θ) = y_B² sec² θ\n\n=> l = y_B sec θ => y_B = l cos θ\n\nBut we also have y_B = r(1 + cos θ). Therefore:\n\nr(1 + cos θ) = l cos θ => r + r cos θ = l cos θ => r = (l - r) cos θ => cos θ = r / (l - r)\n\nThis implies that cos θ is constant, which would mean θ is constant, but θ(t) = v₀ t / r, which increases with time. This is only possible if either l approaches infinity (making cos θ approach zero) or some other condition, but in general, this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my assumptions.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption that point A has velocity v₀ might be incorrect. The problem states \"the other end, edge A, resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder.\" The phrase \"moving with the cylinder\" could mean that point A is instantaneously moving with the same velocity as the cylinder's surface at that point, which for rolling without slipping, the velocity at the contact point is zero. But if point A is not the contact point, but somewhere else on the plane, then its velocity would depend on its position.\n\nWait, if the cylinder is rolling without slipping, then the instantaneous velocity of any point on the plane is zero only at the contact point. Other points on the plane are stationary, but if point A is in contact with the plane and not slipping, then its velocity should be zero? But the problem says it's moving with the cylinder. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"moving with the cylinder\" means that point A has the same horizontal velocity as the cylinder's axis, v₀. But if that's the case, then our previous derivation leads to a contradiction unless l and r satisfy specific conditions. This suggests that perhaps my earlier approach is missing something.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe instead of assuming v_A = (v₀, 0), I should derive v_A from the fact that point A is on the plane and AB is a rigid body.\n\nSince point A is on the plane, its y-coordinate is always zero. Let me denote its coordinates as (x_A(t), 0). The velocity of A is then (dx_A/dt, 0). Since AB is a rigid body, the distance between A and B is constant:\n\n(x_B(t) - x_A(t))² + y_B(t)^2 = l²\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to time:\n\n2(x_B - x_A)(dx_B/dt - dx_A/dt) + 2y_B dy_B/dt = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n(x_B - x_A)(v_Bx - v_Ax) + y_B v_By = 0\n\nWe know v_Ax = dx_A/dt, v_By = dy_B/dt = -v₀ sin θ(t), and v_Bx = v₀ + v₀ cos θ(t). Let me substitute these:\n\n(x_B - x_A)([v₀ + v₀ cos θ] - v_Ax) + y_B (-v₀ sin θ) = 0\n\nSolving for v_Ax:\n\n(x_B - x_A)(v₀ + v₀ cos θ - v_Ax) = v₀ y_B sin θ\n\n=> v₀ + v₀ cos θ - v_Ax = [v₀ y_B sin θ] / (x_B - x_A)\n\n=> v_Ax = v₀ + v₀ cos θ - [v₀ y_B sin θ] / (x_B - x_A)\n\nBut from the earlier equation (x_B - x_A)^2 + y_B^2 = l², we have x_B - x_A = ±√(l² - y_B²). Let me denote Δx = x_B - x_A = ±√(l² - y_B²). Therefore:\n\nv_Ax = v₀ + v₀ cos θ - [v₀ y_B sin θ] / Δx\n\nThis gives us the velocity of point A. Now, since point A is on the plane, its velocity is (v_Ax, 0). Now, since AB is a rigid body, the angular velocity ω_AB can be found from the relation between the velocities of A and B.\n\nAlternatively, since we have v_A and v_B, we can compute ω_AB.\n\nThe angular velocity ω_AB is given by:\n\nω_AB = (v_A - v_B) × r_{BA} / |r_{BA}|²\n\nWhere r_{BA} is the vector from B to A, which is (Δx, -y_B). In 2D, the cross product is scalar magnitude: (v_Ax - v_Bx) * (-y_B) - (v_Ay - v_By) * Δx. Since v_Ay = 0 and v_By = -v₀ sin θ, this becomes:\n\nω_AB = [ (v_Ax - v_Bx)(-y_B) - (0 - (-v₀ sin θ))Δx ] / |r_{BA}|²\n\nBut |r_{BA}|² = l².\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n= -y_B(v_Ax - v_Bx) - v₀ sin θ * Δx\n\nSubstitute v_Ax from earlier:\n\n= -y_B[ v₀ + v₀ cos θ - [v₀ y_B sin θ / Δx ] - v_Bx ] - v₀ sin θ * Δx\n\nBut v_Bx = v₀ + v₀ cos θ, so:\n\n= -y_B[ v₀ + v₀ cos θ - [v₀ y_B sin θ / Δx ] - (v₀ + v₀ cos θ) ] - v₀ sin θ * Δx\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n= -y_B[ - [v₀ y_B sin θ / Δx ] ] - v₀ sin θ * Δx\n\n= y_B * [v₀ y_B sin θ / Δx ] - v₀ sin θ * Δx\n\nFactor out v₀ sin θ:\n\n= v₀ sin θ [ y_B² / Δx - Δx ]\n\n= v₀ sin θ [ (y_B² - Δx²) / Δx ]\n\nBut from Δx² + y_B² = l² => y_B² - Δx² = y_B² - (l² - y_B²) = 2y_B² - l². Wait, no:\n\nWait Δx² = l² - y_B² => y_B² - Δx² = y_B² - (l² - y_B²) = 2y_B² - l². Therefore:\n\n= v₀ sin θ [ (2y_B² - l²) / Δx ]\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps there is a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, since we have expressions for v_Ax, maybe we can relate it to the angular velocity.\n\nThe velocity of A relative to B is v_A - v_B = ω_AB × r_{BA}. In 2D, this gives:\n\nv_Ax - v_Bx = -ω_AB * y_B\n\n0 - v_By = ω_AB * Δx\n\nFrom the second equation: -v_By = ω_AB * Δx => ω_AB = -v_By / Δx\n\nWe know v_By = -v₀ sin θ, so:\n\nω_AB = -(-v₀ sin θ) / Δx = v₀ sin θ / Δx\n\nBut Δx = ±√(l² - y_B²). Therefore:\n\nω_AB = v₀ sin θ / ±√(l² - y_B²)\n\nThe sign depends on the choice of Δx. Earlier, we had from the y-component equation that Δx = - y_B tan θ, which led to a contradiction. But now, using this relation, we can check.\n\nFrom ω_AB = v₀ sin θ / Δx, and from earlier, we also had from the x-component equation:\n\nFrom the x-component equation in the previous approach, we had ω_AB = -v₀ cos θ / y_B. Therefore, equating the two expressions for ω_AB:\n\nv₀ sin θ / Δx = -v₀ cos θ / y_B\n\n=> sin θ / Δx = -cos θ / y_B\n\n=> Δx = - y_B tan θ\n\nWhich is the same result as before. And this leads to the same contradiction when substituted into Δx = ±√(l² - y_B²). Therefore, this suggests that our initial assumption that point A is moving with velocity v_Ax is leading to a contradiction unless specific conditions on l and r are met. This implies that there might be an error in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me revisit the problem statement: \"There is a rectangular plate of length l, with edge B hinged to the edge of the cylinder, and the other end, edge A, resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder.\" The phrase \"moving with the cylinder\" might mean that point A is instantaneously at rest relative to the cylinder's surface at the point of contact. But since the cylinder is rolling without slipping, the instantaneous velocity of the cylinder's surface at the contact point is zero. If point A is always in contact with the plane, then its velocity should also be zero, implying no slipping. However, if the plate is hinged at B, which is moving, then point A would need to have both zero velocity and be connected to B, which is moving. This seems possible only if the plate is instantaneously rotating such that the velocity of A is zero.\n\nLet me try this approach: assume that point A has velocity zero. Then, in the equation v_A = v_B + ω_AB × r_{BA}, we have 0 = v_B + ω_AB × r_{BA}. This would give us:\n\nFrom x-component: 0 = v_Bx + ω_AB * y_B\n\nFrom y-component: 0 = v_By - ω_AB * Δx\n\nFrom x-component: ω_AB = -v_Bx / y_B = -[v₀ + v₀ cos θ] / y_B\n\nFrom y-component: ω_AB = v_By / Δx = [-v₀ sin θ] / Δx\n\nTherefore, equating:\n\n-[v₀ + v₀ cos θ] / y_B = -v₀ sin θ / Δx\n\n=> [1 + cos θ] / y_B = sin θ / Δx\n\n=> Δx = y_B sin θ / (1 + cos θ)\n\nBut Δx = x_B - x_A = ±√(l² - y_B²)\n\nAnd y_B = r(1 + cos θ)\n\nTherefore:\n\nΔx = [r(1 + cos θ) * sin θ] / (1 + cos θ) = r sin θ\n\nSo Δx = r sin θ\n\nBut Δx = ±√(l² - y_B²) = ±√(l² - [r(1 + cos θ)]²)\n\nTherefore:\n\n±√(l² - r²(1 + cos θ)^2) = r sin θ\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nl² - r²(1 + 2cos θ + cos² θ) = r² sin² θ\n\nSimplify right side: r² sin² θ = r²(1 - cos² θ)\n\nLeft side: l² - r² - 2r² cos θ - r² cos² θ\n\nTherefore:\n\nl² - r² - 2r² cos θ - r² cos² θ = r² - r² cos² θ\n\nSimplify:\n\nl² - r² - 2r² cos θ - r² cos² θ - r² + r² cos² θ = 0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nl² - 2r² - 2r² cos θ = 0\n\n=> l² = 2r²(1 + cos θ)\n\nBut θ = v₀ t / r, so this would require l to vary with time unless 1 + cos θ is constant, which it isn't. This suggests another contradiction, unless l² = 2r²(1 + cos θ) for all t, which is only possible if θ is constant, but θ varies with time. Hence, this approach also leads to a contradiction.\n\nThis indicates that my understanding of the problem is flawed. Let me go back to the problem statement.\n\n\"A cylinder with a radius of r rolls without slipping along a plane, with its axis O maintaining a constant velocity v₀. There is a rectangular plate of length l, with edge B hinged to the edge of the cylinder, and the other end, edge A, resting on the plane and moving with the cylinder. If φ=0 at time t=0, taking B as a reference point, write the kinematic equations of the AB plate.\"\n\nMaybe \"moving with the cylinder\" means that point A is instantaneously moving with the same velocity as the cylinder's axis, v₀. But as we saw, this leads to contradictions unless specific conditions are met. Alternatively, maybe \"moving with the cylinder\" means that point A is part of the cylinder, but it's stated that it's the other end of the plate, which is resting on the plane.\n\nWait, perhaps the plate is like a spoke, attached at B to the cylinder, and free to rotate about B, with A always touching the ground. As the cylinder rolls, the plate AB will swing under the cylinder, maintaining contact with the ground at A. This is similar to a pendulum attached to a moving cart.\n\nIn this case, the motion of A is constrained to the plane, and the length of AB is l. This is a constrained motion problem, where we need to find the angular position of the plate φ(t) as the cylinder rolls.\n\nLet me try to model this as a pendulum attached to a moving pivot. The pivot B is moving along a cycloid, and the pendulum AB has length l, with A constrained to y=0.\n\nThis is a complex system, but perhaps we can derive φ(t) by relating the positions.\n\nLet me define φ(t) as the angle between AB and the vertical line through B. At t=0, φ=0, so AB is vertical, and point A is at (x_B(0), y_B(0) - l). At t=0, x_B(0) = 0, y_B(0) = 2r, so A is at (0, 2r - l). For A to be on the plane, 2r - l = 0 => l = 2r. Therefore, the problem likely assumes that l = 2r, even though it's given as general l. Perhaps it's a typo or oversight, or maybe I need to proceed with general l.\n\nAssuming l = 2r, then at t=0, A is at (0, 0). As the cylinder rolls, B moves along the cycloid, and A moves along the plane. Let's proceed with this assumption for now, since it resolves the earlier contradiction.\n\nSo, with l = 2r, we have:\n\nAt any time t, the coordinates of B are:\n\nx_B(t) = v₀ t + r sin(θ(t))\n\ny_B(t) = r + r cos(θ(t)) = r(1 + cos(θ(t)))\n\nWhere θ(t) = v₀ t / r.\n\nThe coordinates of A are (x_A(t), 0), and the distance between A and B is 2r. Therefore:\n\n(x_B - x_A)^2 + y_B^2 = (2r)^2\n\n=> (x_B - x_A)^2 + [r(1 + cos θ)]^2 = 4r²\n\n=> (x_B - x_A)^2 = 4r² - r²(1 + 2cos θ + cos² θ) = 4r² - r² - 2r² cos θ - r² cos² θ = 3r² - 2r² cos θ - r² cos² θ\n\nThis seems complicated, but with l = 2r, maybe we can find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, since φ(t) is the angle between AB and the vertical through B, and AB has length 2r, the vertical distance from B to A is 2r cos φ(t), and the horizontal distance is 2r sin φ(t). Therefore:\n\nVertical distance: y_B(t) = 2r cos φ(t)\n\nHorizontal distance: x_B(t) - x_A(t) = ±2r sin φ(t)\n\nFrom the vertical distance:\n\nr(1 + cos θ(t)) = 2r cos φ(t) => 1 + cos θ(t) = 2 cos φ(t) => cos φ(t) = (1 + cos θ(t))/2\n\nFrom the horizontal distance:\n\nx_B(t) - x_A(t) = ±2r sin φ(t)\n\nBut since the plate is attached such that A moves with the cylinder, we need to determine the sign. At t=0, θ(0)=0, so cos φ(0) = (1 + 1)/2 = 1 => φ(0) = 0, which matches the problem statement. The horizontal distance at t=0 is x_B(0) - x_A(0) = 0 - 0 = 0, which should equal ±2r sin φ(0) = 0, which is consistent. As the cylinder rolls forward, let's assume the plate swings to the right, so x_A(t) < x_B(t), hence x_B - x_A = +2r sin φ(t). Therefore:\n\nx_A(t) = x_B(t) - 2r sin φ(t)\n\nBut from above, φ(t) is related to θ(t) by cos φ(t) = (1 + cos θ(t))/2. Let me solve for φ(t):\n\nLet me recall the double-angle identity: 1 + cos θ = 2 cos²(θ/2). Therefore:\n\ncos φ(t) = (2 cos²(θ/2))/2 = cos²(θ/2)\n\nTherefore, φ(t) = arccos(cos²(θ/2))\n\nBut this is complicated. Alternatively, using the identity:\n\ncos φ = cos²(θ/2) = (1 + cos θ)/2\n\nThis can be rewritten using the half-angle formula. Let me recall that cos φ = cos²(θ/2) implies that φ = ±θ/2 + some function, but it's not straightforward. Let me instead express φ in terms of θ.\n\nLet me set φ = θ/2. Then cos φ = cos(θ/2), which is not equal to cos²(θ/2). Alternatively, if φ = θ/2, then cos φ = cos(θ/2), and we have:\n\ncos φ = sqrt((1 + cos θ)/2). Wait, that is the half-angle identity: cos(θ/2) = sqrt((1 + cos θ)/2). Therefore, if cos φ = (1 + cos θ)/2, then this is not the same as the half-angle identity. Let me square both sides:\n\ncos² φ = [(1 + cos θ)/2]^2\n\nBut from the half-angle identity, we have:\n\ncos²(θ/2) = (1 + cos θ)/2\n\nTherefore, if we let φ = arccos(sqrt((1 + cos θ)/2)), but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me use substitution. Let θ(t) = 2α(t). Then:\n\ncos φ = (1 + cos(2α))/2 = cos² α\n\nTherefore, φ = ±α + 2πn, but since φ and α are angles, we can take φ = α, so φ = α = θ/2.\n\nWait, if θ = 2α, then cos φ = cos² α, which implies φ = ±α + ...? Let me take α = φ, then θ = 2φ, and cos φ = cos²(φ/2). Wait, this seems recursive. Let me try specific values. Let's say θ = 0, then cos φ = 1, so φ = 0, which is correct. If θ = π, then cos φ = (1 - 1)/2 = 0, so φ = π/2. If θ = π, then φ = π/2. If θ = 2π, cos φ = (1 + 1)/2 = 1, φ = 0, which makes sense as the plate returns to vertical. This suggests that φ = θ/2. Let me check:\n\nIf φ = θ/2, then cos φ = cos(θ/2), and according to our earlier equation, cos φ = (1 + cos θ)/2. But from the double-angle identity, cos θ = 2cos²(θ/2) - 1, so (1 + cos θ)/2 = cos²(θ/2). Therefore, our equation is cos φ = cos²(θ/2). If φ = θ/2, then cos φ = cos(θ/2), which is not equal to cos²(θ/2) unless cos(θ/2) is 0 or 1. Therefore, this suggests that φ is not simply θ/2, but another function.\n\nLet me instead solve for φ in terms of θ. Let me set x = θ/2, then:\n\ncos φ = (1 + cos 2x)/2 = cos² x\n\nTherefore, φ = arccos(cos² x). This doesn't simplify easily, but perhaps we can express it in terms of other trigonometric functions. Alternatively, we can leave it as is.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of writing kinematic equations, perhaps we don't need to explicitly solve for φ(t), but instead relate it through the position.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed. We have:\n\ncos φ(t) = (1 + cos θ(t))/2, where θ(t) = v₀ t / r.\n\nTherefore, φ(t) = arccos[(1 + cos(v₀ t / r))/2]\n\nThis is an expression for φ(t). To find the angular velocity, we can differentiate φ(t) with respect to t.\n\nLet me compute dφ/dt:\n\nLet me set u = v₀ t / r, so θ = u, and φ = arccos[(1 + cos u)/2].\n\nLet me denote f(u) = arccos[(1 + cos u)/2]. Let's find df/du.\n\nLet me set y = (1 + cos u)/2. Then f = arccos y.\n\ndf/du = (d/dy arccos y) * dy/du = (-1 / sqrt(1 - y²)) * (-sin u / 2)\n\nCompute 1 - y² = 1 - [(1 + cos u)/2]^2 = [4 - (1 + 2cos u + cos² u)] / 4 = [3 - 2cos u - cos² u]/4\n\nThis seems complex, but let's proceed:\n\ndf/du = [1 / sqrt(1 - y²)] * (sin u / 2) = [1 / sqrt([3 - 2cos u - cos² u]/4)] * (sin u / 2) = [2 / sqrt(3 - 2cos u - cos² u)] * (sin u / 2) = sin u / sqrt(3 - 2cos u - cos² u)\n\nThis is quite complicated. Perhaps there's a trigonometric identity to simplify the denominator.\n\nLet me compute the denominator: 3 - 2cos u - cos² u.\n\nLet me rewrite it:\n\n3 - 2cos u - cos² u = 3 - cos² u - 2cos u\n\nLet me recall that cos² u = 1 - sin² u, but not sure if helpful. Alternatively, let me consider:\n\nLet me write it as -cos² u - 2cos u + 3 = - (cos² u + 2cos u - 3). Let me solve for cos u.\n\nBut maybe it's better to use the earlier relation: from cos φ = (1 + cos u)/2, and we have from the double-angle identity: cos φ = cos²(u/2). Therefore, φ = ±u/2 + 2πn, but since φ and u are related continuously and φ=0 when u=0, we take φ = u/2. Wait, but earlier we saw that this leads to cos φ = cos²(u/2), which is not equal to (1 + cos u)/2. Wait, no, actually, (1 + cos u)/2 is equal to cos²(u/2). Yes! The double-angle identity is:\n\ncos u = 2cos²(u/2) - 1 => 1 + cos u = 2cos²(u/2) => (1 + cos u)/2 = cos²(u/2). Therefore, our equation is:\n\ncos φ = cos²(u/2) = [cos(u/2)]²\n\nThis implies that φ = arccos([cos(u/2)]²). This is not a standard identity, but if we let φ = arccos([cos(u/2)]²), it's a valid expression, though it doesn't simplify to a simple function of u. However, this suggests that φ is a function that depends on the square of the cosine of half the angle, which is complex.\n\nHowever, if we consider the relationship between φ and u, perhaps we can find a relationship between their derivatives. Let me differentiate both sides of cos φ = cos²(u/2):\n\n- sin φ * dφ/dt = 2 cos(u/2) * (-sin(u/2)) * (1/2) * du/dt\n\nSimplify:\n\n- sin φ * dφ/dt = -cos(u/2) sin(u/2) * du/dt\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nsin φ * dφ/dt = cos(u/2) sin(u/2) * du/dt\n\nUsing the identity sin(2α) = 2 sin α cos α, we have:\n\nsin φ * dφ/dt = (1/2) sin u * du/dt\n\nBut du/dt = d/dt (v₀ t / r) = v₀ / r\n\nTherefore:\n\nsin φ * dφ/dt = (1/2) sin u * (v₀ / r)\n\n=> dφ/dt = [v₀ / (2r)] * [sin u / sin φ]\n\nBut u = v₀ t / r, and φ is related to u through cos φ = cos²(u/2). Let me express sin φ in terms of u.\n\nFrom cos φ = cos²(u/2), we have sin φ = sqrt(1 - cos² φ) = sqrt(1 - cos^4(u/2)) = sqrt((1 - cos²(u/2))(1 + cos²(u/2))) = sin(u/2) * sqrt(1 + cos²(u/2))\n\nThis seems complex, but let's substitute back into the expression for dφ/dt:\n\ndφ/dt = [v₀ / (2r)] * [sin u / (sin(u/2) * sqrt(1 + cos²(u/2)) ) ]\n\nSimplify sin u = 2 sin(u/2) cos(u/2):\n\ndφ/dt = [v₀ / (2r)] * [2 sin(u/2) cos(u/2) / (sin(u/2) * sqrt(1 + cos²(u/2)) ) ] = [v₀ / (2r)] * [2 cos(u/2) / sqrt(1 + cos²(u/2)) ] = [v₀ / r] * [cos(u/2) / sqrt(1 + cos²(u/2)) ]\n\nThis is still complex, but it gives the angular velocity of the plate AB.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the kinematic equations are best expressed in terms of φ(t) as defined by φ = arccos[(1 + cos(v₀ t / r))/2], with angular velocity and acceleration derived from this.\n\nHowever, the problem asks to \"write the kinematic equations of the AB plate.\" This likely includes the position, velocity, and acceleration of points on the plate, or the angular position, velocity, and acceleration.\n\nSince we have φ(t) defined in terms of θ(t) = v₀ t / r, and we have expressions for the angular velocity, we can write:\n\nφ(t) = arccos[(1 + cos(θ(t)))/2] = arccos[cos²(θ(t)/2)]\n\nAngular velocity: ω(t) = dφ/dt = [v₀ / r] * [cos(θ(t)/2) / sqrt(1 + cos²(θ(t)/2))]\n\nAngular acceleration: α(t) = dω/dt, which would require differentiating the above expression, which is quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the relation sin φ * dφ/dt = (v₀ / (2r)) sin u, where u = θ(t), and φ is related to u by cos φ = (1 + cos u)/2, we can write:\n\nω(t) = dφ/dt = (v₀ / (2r)) * sin u / sin φ\n\nBut since sin u = 2 sin(u/2) cos(u/2), and from cos φ = cos²(u/2), we have sin φ = sqrt(1 - cos^4(u/2)) = sin(u/2) * sqrt(1 + cos²(u/2)), as before.\n\nThis shows the relationship between the angular velocity of the plate and the angle u = θ(t).\n\nGiven the complexity of these expressions, it's possible that the problem expects a simpler answer, perhaps assuming small angles or a specific condition, but since the problem states φ=0 at t=0 and asks for the general kinematic equations, we have to proceed with what we have.\n\nTo summarize, the kinematic equations for the plate AB, taking B as a reference, involve:\n\n1. Angular position: φ(t) = arccos[(1 + cos(v₀ t / r))/2]\n\n2. Angular velocity: ω(t) = dφ/dt, as derived above\n\n3. Angular acceleration: α(t) = dω/dt\n\nHowever, these expressions are quite complex. Alternatively, if we use the relation φ = arccos[cos²(θ/2)], we might express it using inverse trigonometric functions, but it's still non-trivial.\n\nAlternatively, if we parameterize the motion using θ(t) = v₀ t / r, and express φ in terms of θ, then the angular velocity and acceleration can be expressed in terms of θ and its derivatives.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of θ(t), recognizing that φ is related to θ through the geometry of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the position of point A, which is (x_A(t), 0), and we have x_A(t) = x_B(t) - 2r sin φ(t), and x_B(t) = v₀ t + r sin θ(t), then:\n\nx_A(t) = v₀ t + r sin θ(t) - 2r sin φ(t)\n\nBut from earlier, we have cos φ(t) = (1 + cos θ(t))/2, and we can relate sin φ(t) to θ(t).\n\nFrom cos φ = (1 + cos θ)/2, we have:\n\nsin φ = sqrt(1 - [(1 + cos θ)/2]^2) = sqrt([4 - (1 + 2cos θ + cos² θ)] / 4) = sqrt([3 - 2cos θ - cos² θ]/4)\n\nThis is the same expression as before. Therefore, x_A(t) can be written as:\n\nx_A(t) = v₀ t + r sin θ(t) - 2r * sqrt([3 - 2cos θ - cos² θ]/4) = v₀ t + r sin θ(t) - r * sqrt(3 - 2cos θ - cos² θ)\n\nThis is the position of point A as a function of time, but it's still complex.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity of the expressions, I think the expected answer might be to express the angular position φ(t) in terms of the cylinder's rotation angle θ(t), and then write the angular velocity and acceleration based on that relationship, even if the expressions are complex.\n\nTherefore, the kinematic equations of the AB plate, taking B as a reference, are:\n\n1. Angular position: φ(t) = arccos[(1 + cos(θ(t)))/2], where θ(t) = v₀ t / r.\n\n2. Angular velocity: ω(t) = dφ/dt = (v₀ / (2r)) * sin θ(t) / sin φ(t).\n\n3. Angular acceleration: α(t) = dω/dt, which would require further differentiation.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the relation between φ and θ, and express everything in terms of θ, we might write:\n\nSince φ = arccos[(1 + cos θ)/2], and θ = v₀ t / r, we can write the angular velocity as:\n\nω = dφ/dt = (dφ/dθ) * (dθ/dt) = (dφ/dθ) * (v₀ / r)\n\nTo find dφ/dθ, let's differentiate φ = arccos[(1 + cos θ)/2] with respect to θ:\n\nLet y = (1 + cos θ)/2, so φ = arccos y.\n\ndφ/dθ = (dφ/dy) * (dy/dθ) = (-1 / sqrt(1 - y²)) * (-sin θ / 2) = (sin θ / 2) / sqrt(1 - y²)\n\nAs before, 1 - y² = 1 - [(1 + cos θ)/2]^2 = [4 - (1 + 2cos θ + cos² θ)] / 4 = [3 - 2cos θ - cos² θ]/4.\n\nThus, dφ/dθ = (sin θ / 2) / sqrt([3 - 2cos θ - cos² θ]/4) = (sin θ / 2) / (sqrt(3 - 2cos θ - cos² θ)/2) = sin θ / sqrt(3 - 2cos θ - cos² θ)\n\nTherefore, ω = (v₀ / r) * [sin θ / sqrt(3 - 2cos θ - cos² θ)]\n\nThis is the angular velocity in terms of θ.\n\nTo write this in terms of φ, we can use the earlier relation sin φ * ω = (v₀ / (2r)) sin θ, but it might not simplify further.\n\nGiven the problem's context, it's possible that the expected answer is to express φ(t) in terms of θ(t) and provide the angular velocity and acceleration in terms of θ(t) and its derivatives, as above.\n\nTherefore, the kinematic equations of the AB plate, taking B as a reference, are:\n\n- Angular position: φ(t) = arccos[(1 + cos(v₀ t / r))/2]\n\n- Angular velocity: ω(t) = (v₀ / r) * [sin(v₀ t / r) / sqrt(3 - 2cos(v₀ t / r) - cos²(v₀ t / r))]\n\n- Angular acceleration: α(t) = dω/dt, which would involve differentiating the above expression.\n\nHowever, these expressions are quite complex, and it's possible that the problem expects a simpler form, perhaps under the assumption that the plate is always making a certain angle or under small angle approximations, but since no such assumptions are given, this is the most accurate derivation I can provide.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem expects the use of relative motion analysis, expressing the position vector of A with respect to B, and then finding the angular variables from that.\n\nGiven that, let me try to express the position vector of A with respect to B as:\n\nr_{AB} = l * e_{φ}, where e_{φ} is the unit vector at angle φ from B.\n\nSince point A is at (x_A, 0), and B is at (x_B, y_B), the vector from B to A is (x_A - x_B, -y_B). This vector should have magnitude l and direction -φ (since φ is measured from the vertical, assuming φ is the angle from the vertical to AB). Wait, if φ is the angle from the vertical, then the direction of r_{AB} is -φ from the vertical, or π/2 - φ from the horizontal?\n\nThis is getting too abstract. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think it's best to present the angular position φ(t) as derived, and the angular velocity and acceleration in terms of θ(t), as above, even if they are complex.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular position of the plate AB is given by $\\boxed{\\varphi(t) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{v_0 t}{r}\\right)}{2}\\right)}$.\n</think>"}
