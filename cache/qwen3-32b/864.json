I need to figure out the constant speed at which this electric motor can lift a 6 kg mass. The motor's input is 120 volts AC at 1 ampere, 60 Hz, and it has an efficiency of 75%. The options are given, so I need to calculate the correct speed.\n\nFirst, I remember that power is involved here. The motor's input power is electrical, and the output power is mechanical, which is used to lift the mass. Since there's an efficiency given, I need to account for that. Efficiency is the ratio of output power to input power, right? So, the input power is the electrical power, and the output power is the mechanical power used to lift the mass.\n\nLet me recall the formula for electrical power. For an electric motor, the input power (P_input) is voltage multiplied by current. So P_input = V * I. The voltage is 120 V, and the current is 1.0 A. So that would be 120 V * 1.0 A = 120 watts. But wait, the efficiency is 75%, so the output power is 75% of that. So P_output = 0.75 * P_input = 0.75 * 120 W = 90 watts. That's the mechanical power available to lift the mass.\n\nNow, the mechanical power needed to lift a mass at a constant speed is equal to the force required to lift the mass multiplied by the velocity. The force required to lift the mass is the weight of the mass, which is mass times gravity. So force F = m * g. Here, m is 6 kg, and g is 9.8 m/s². Let me calculate that: 6 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 58.8 Newtons.\n\nPower in mechanics is force multiplied by velocity (P = F * v). So rearranging that to solve for velocity, v = P / F. The mechanical power is 90 watts, so v = 90 W / 58.8 N. Let me compute that. 90 divided by 58.8... Let me do the division. 58.8 goes into 90 once, with 31.2 remaining. 58.8 * 1.5 is 88.2, so 90 - 88.2 is 1.8. So approximately 1.54... Hmm. Wait, 58.8 * 1.5 = 88.2, so 90 / 58.8 = 1.529... So approximately 1.53 m/s. The options given are A:0.5, B:1.0, C:1.5, D:2.0. So 1.53 is closest to option C:1.5 m/s. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Input power is 120V * 1A = 120W. Efficiency is 75%, so output is 90W. Then force is 6kg * 9.8 = 58.8N. Then velocity is 90 / 58.8 ≈ 1.529 m/s. Yeah, that's correct. So the closest option is C:1.5 m/s. So I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use g as 10 m/s² for simplification? Let me try that. If g is 10, then F = 6*10=60N. Then velocity is 90 / 60 = 1.5 m/s exactly. So that gives exactly 1.5 m/s. So maybe the problem expects using g=10 m/s² for simplification. In that case, answer is C. So either way, with exact calculation or with g=10, the answer is C. Therefore, the correct answer is C:1.5 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
