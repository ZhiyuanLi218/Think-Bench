The plasma is made up of free charges with mass m and charge e, and there are n charges per unit volume. The interactions between charges are negligible. A plane electromagnetic wave with frequency ω and wave number k is incident on this plasma. Also, the plasma frequency is given by ω_pe² = n e² / (ε₀ m). \n\nFirst, I remember that conductivity relates the current density to the electric field. In general, σ is a complex quantity when dealing with electromagnetic waves because the current can have a phase difference with the electric field. Since we're dealing with a plasma, which is a collection of free charges, I think the conductivity will depend on how the charges respond to the oscillating electric field of the wave.\n\nLet me start by recalling the basic equation of motion for a charge in an electric field. If there's an electric field E, then the force on a charge e is F = e E. But since the charges are moving, there should be some damping or resistance, which could be due to collisions or other effects. However, the problem states that the interactions between charges can be neglected. Hmm, but even without inter-particle interactions, there might be another damping term. Wait, in the Drude model, the conductivity is derived by considering a damping term due to collisions. Maybe I need to use something similar here?\n\nIn the Drude model, the equation of motion for an electron is:\n\nm (dv/dt) = -e E - m γ v\n\nWhere γ is the collision frequency. But since the problem says interactions between charges are negligible, maybe the damping term is not due to collisions but something else? Or maybe the problem is assuming no collisions, so γ = 0? Wait, but if there's no damping, the conductivity would be purely imaginary and lead to resonant behavior. However, in reality, there's always some damping. But since the problem doesn't mention collisions, maybe we can assume γ = 0? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the wave is oscillating, we can consider the linear response of the charges to the electric field. Let me think. The charges are free, so their acceleration is due to the electric field. Let me try to write down the equation of motion.\n\nAssume that the electric field is oscillating as E(t) = E₀ e^{-i ω t}, using complex notation. The charges will respond to this field. Let me consider the force on a single charge: F = e E(t). Then Newton's second law gives:\n\nm d²x/dt² = -e E(t)\n\nWait, but if there is no damping term, then this is a simple harmonic oscillator equation. However, if the electric field is oscillating at frequency ω, then solving this equation would give the acceleration of the charges. But how does this relate to current density?\n\nThe current density J is given by the charge density times the velocity. Since each charge has charge e and there are n per unit volume, the current density should be J = n e v, where v is the velocity of the charges. So if I can find v in terms of E, then J = σ E gives σ.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. Let me denote the position of the charge as x(t). Then velocity v(t) = dx/dt, and acceleration a(t) = dv/dt. The equation of motion is:\n\nm a(t) = -e E(t)\n\nAssuming no other forces (no damping). So:\n\nd²x/dt² = -(e/m) E(t)\n\nBut E(t) is oscillating as E₀ e^{-i ω t}. Let me take E(t) = E₀ e^{-i ω t}, then:\n\nd²x/dt² = -(e/m) E₀ e^{-i ω t}\n\nIntegrate once to get velocity:\n\nv(t) = dx/dt = (i e/(m ω)) E₀ e^{-i ω t} + C\n\nAssuming that the system is in steady state, the transient term C would be zero. So:\n\nv(t) = (i e/(m ω)) E(t)\n\nTherefore, the current density J = n e v = n e * (i e/(m ω)) E(t) = (i n e² / (m ω)) E(t)\n\nBut J = σ E, so σ = i n e² / (m ω)\n\nBut wait, this seems too simple. Also, the plasma frequency is given by ω_pe² = n e²/(ε₀ m). So if I write σ in terms of ω_pe, then σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nBut is this correct? Let me check the units. Conductivity σ has units of S/m (siemens per meter), which is equivalent to (C² s / (kg m³)). Let me check the units of i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nε₀ has units of C²/(N m²) = C² s²/(kg m³). ω_pe² has units of 1/s². So ε₀ ω_pe² has units of C² s²/(kg m³) * 1/s² = C²/(kg m³). Divided by ω (1/s) gives C² s/(kg m³), which matches the units of conductivity. So that checks out. \n\nBut why does this result not have any dependence on the wavevector k? The problem mentions that the wave has frequency ω and wave number k, but in our derivation, we only used ω. Is that okay? Well, in the derivation, we considered the response of the charges to the electric field, which is a local response. Since we neglected interactions between charges, the conductivity is a local quantity, independent of k. Therefore, in the Drude model (without collisions), the conductivity is indeed σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. However, usually the Drude model includes a damping term and has a term like σ = [i n e² / (m (ω + i γ))], which would lead to σ = [ε₀ ω_pe² / (ω + i γ)]. But here, since there is no damping (γ = 0?), we get σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω.\n\nBut wait, in our derivation, we didn't include a damping term. However, the problem says that the plasma is dilute and interactions are neglected. So perhaps there is no damping? But in reality, even in a plasma, there can be collisions or radiation damping. However, since the problem does not mention collisions, perhaps we can assume γ = 0. \n\nBut let me think again. If we have a conductor with no damping, then the conductivity would be purely imaginary and proportional to 1/ω. However, in the case of plasma, there is a different approach. The dispersion relation of plasma is usually given by ω² = ω_pe² + c² k². But how does that relate to conductivity?\n\nAlternatively, we can derive the conductivity by considering Maxwell's equations. Let me try that approach. In a medium, Maxwell's equations are:\n\n∇×E = -∂B/∂t\n\n∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )\n\nAssuming J = σ E. In a plasma, J is also given by J = n e v. \n\nBut we can also relate the current density to the polarization or magnetization, but since the charges are free, we can directly relate J to σ E. \n\nAssume a plane wave solution: E = E₀ e^{i(k z - ω t)}, similarly for B. Then, taking the curl of E:\n\n∇×E = i k E × \\hat{z} = -∂B/∂t => B = (μ₀ ε₀ ω /k ) E\n\nThen ∇×B = μ₀ J + i ω μ₀ ε₀ E \n\nBut ∇×B for a plane wave is similar, i k B × \\hat{z}. So:\n\ni k B = μ₀ J + i ω μ₀ ε₀ E \n\nSubstitute B from above:\n\ni k (μ₀ ε₀ ω /k ) E = μ₀ J + i ω μ₀ ε₀ E \n\nSimplify left side: i μ₀ ε₀ ω E \n\nTherefore:\n\ni μ₀ ε₀ ω E = μ₀ J + i ω μ₀ ε₀ E \n\nSubtract i ω μ₀ ε₀ E from both sides:\n\n0 = μ₀ J => J = 0?\n\nWait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I need to be careful with the directions. Let me write more carefully.\n\nAssume E is in the x-direction, propagating in z-direction. Then:\n\nE = E₀ e^{i(k z - ω t)} \\hat{x}\n\nThen ∇×E = (∂E_x/∂z) \\hat{y} - ... Wait, more precisely:\n\n∇×E = [∂E_z/∂y - ∂E_y/∂z] \\hat{x} + [∂E_x/∂z - ∂E_z/∂x] \\hat{y} + [∂E_y/∂x - ∂E_x/∂y] \\hat{z}\n\nSince E has only x-component and varies only with z, this becomes:\n\n∇×E = ∂E_x/∂z \\hat{y} = i k E₀ e^{i(k z - ω t)} \\hat{y} = i k E \\hat{y}\n\nThen -∂B/∂t = i k E \\hat{y} => B = (1/(i ω)) (-∂B/∂t) = (i k E / i ω) \\hat{y} = (k / ω) E \\hat{y}\n\nBut B is in the y-direction. Now take ∇×B:\n\nB is in y-direction, varying with z. So ∇×B = ∂B_y/∂z \\hat{x} - ... \n\nWhich is ∂B_y/∂z \\hat{x} = i k B \\hat{x}\n\nThus:\n\n∇×B = i k B \\hat{x} \n\nOn the other hand, from Ampere's law:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t \n\nCompute ∂E/∂t: -i ω E \n\nSo:\n\ni k B \\hat{x} = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ (-i ω E ) \n\nBut B = (k / ω) E, so substitute:\n\ni k (k / ω) E \\hat{x} = μ₀ J - i ω μ₀ ε₀ E \n\nLeft side: i k² / ω E \n\nTherefore:\n\ni k² / ω E = μ₀ J - i ω μ₀ ε₀ E \n\nBring the term with E to the left:\n\ni k² / ω E + i ω μ₀ ε₀ E = μ₀ J \n\nFactor out E:\n\nE [ i k² / ω + i ω μ₀ ε₀ ] = μ₀ J \n\nDivide both sides by μ₀:\n\nJ = E [ i k² / (ω μ₀ ) + i ω ε₀ ] \n\nBut J = σ E, so:\n\nσ = i [ k² / (ω μ₀ ) + ω ε₀ ] \n\nHmm, but this seems different from what I derived earlier. However, in a plasma, we usually have a relation between k and ω. Let me recall that in a plasma, the dielectric function is ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω². Then the wave equation gives k² = ε μ₀ ε₀ ω². \n\nAlternatively, let's use the previous expression for J. Earlier, from the equation of motion, I found J = i n e² / (m ω) E. Let me plug this into the above expression.\n\nFrom the equation of motion: J = σ E, with σ = i n e²/(m ω). From the Maxwell equation approach, we have σ = i [k²/(ω μ₀ ) + ω ε₀ ].\n\nTherefore, equate the two expressions:\n\ni n e²/(m ω) = i [k²/(ω μ₀ ) + ω ε₀ ]\n\nCancel i:\n\nn e²/(m ω) = k²/(ω μ₀ ) + ω ε₀ \n\nMultiply both sides by ω:\n\nn e²/m = k² / μ₀ + ω² ε₀ \n\nRearranged:\n\nk² = μ₀ ε₀ ω² - μ₀ n e²/m \n\nWhich is:\n\nk² = μ₀ ε₀ (ω² - ω_pe² )\n\nTherefore, k² = μ₀ ε₀ ω² (1 - ω_pe² / ω² )\n\nWhich is the standard dispersion relation for a plasma, where the dielectric constant is ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω². Since ε = ε₀ (1 - ω_pe² / ω² ), then k² = μ₀ ε₀ ω² ε = μ₀ ε₀ ω² (1 - ω_pe² / ω² ), which matches. \n\nSo this shows that the two approaches are consistent. Therefore, the conductivity derived from the equation of motion is correct. Therefore, σ = i n e² / (m ω ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nBut wait, in the expression from Maxwell's equations, σ is also equal to i [k²/(ω μ₀ ) + ω ε₀ ] which, when combined with the dispersion relation, gives the same thing. Therefore, the conductivity is indeed σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nHowever, usually in the Drude model, the conductivity is σ = [i ω_pe² ε₀ ] / [ω (ω + i γ )], where γ is the collision frequency. In our case, since there is no damping (γ = 0), it's σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nBut why is there no real part? Because without damping, the conductivity is purely imaginary. This suggests that the medium does not have a real conductivity (i.e., no dissipation), and the imaginary part relates to the polarization response. In a plasma, when ω > ω_pe, the wave can propagate, and when ω < ω_pe, it is evanescent. \n\nBut the problem asks for the conductivity σ as a function of ω. So according to our derivation, it's σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nBut let me check another way. The current density J is n e v. The velocity v can be obtained from the equation of motion. \n\nLet me rederive it again. \n\nThe electric field is E e^{-i ω t}. The equation of motion is:\n\nm dv/dt = -e E e^{-i ω t}\n\nAssuming no damping. Let me take the time derivative:\n\ndv/dt = (i ω) v \n\nWait, no, let me solve the equation. Let me write:\n\ndv/dt = -(e/m) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nIntegrate over time:\n\nv(t) = v(0) + (e/(i m ω )) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nAssuming that we are in steady state, the homogeneous solution v(0) e^{i ω t} would be zero? Wait, no. Wait, solving the differential equation:\n\ndv/dt + (i ω ) v = - (e/m) E e^{-i ω t} ?\n\nWait, no. Let me do it properly. \n\nLet me write the equation:\n\ndv/dt = -(e/m) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nIntegrate both sides from -infty to t:\n\nv(t) = v(-infty) - (e/m) E ∫_{-infty}^t e^{-i ω t'} dt'\n\nAssuming that the initial velocity v(-infty) = 0 (no electric field initially), then:\n\nv(t) = - (e/m) E ( -1/(i ω )) e^{-i ω t} } \n\nWhich is v(t) = (i e)/(m ω) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nTherefore, J = n e v = n e * (i e)/(m ω) E = i (n e² / (m ω )) E \n\nWhich gives σ = i n e²/(m ω ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nYes, same result. So this seems consistent. \n\nBut in some references, the conductivity of a plasma is given as σ = [i ω_pe² ε₀ ] / [ω (ω + i γ )], but here γ is zero. Therefore, σ is purely imaginary. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. However, sometimes conductivity is written with a negative sign. Let me check the direction. \n\nIn the equation of motion, we have m dv/dt = -e E. If E is in some direction, then the acceleration is opposite to E. But integrating gives velocity proportional to E. However, the sign in the conductivity depends on the charge's sign. Since the problem says the charge is e. If e is positive, then the velocity is in the direction opposite to E? Wait:\n\nWait, m dv/dt = -e E. So if E is positive, then dv/dt is negative if e is positive. Therefore, the acceleration is opposite to E. Integrating, velocity is v = - (e/(i m ω )) E. Wait, earlier I had v(t) = (i e)/(m ω) E e^{-i ω t}. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nLet me do the integral again. \n\ndv/dt = - (e/m) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nIntegrate from -infty to t:\n\nv(t) = - (e/m) E ∫_{-infty}^t e^{-i ω t'} dt'\n\nLet me make substitution τ = t', so integral becomes:\n\n∫_{-infty}^t e^{-i ω τ} dτ = e^{-i ω τ}/(-i ω ) | from -infty to t \n\nWhich is [ e^{-i ω t}/(-i ω ) - lim_{τ→-infty} e^{-i ω τ}/(-i ω ) ]\n\nAssuming that the electric field has been on for a long time, and we are looking for the steady-state response. The limit as τ approaches -infty of e^{-i ω τ} oscillates, but if we consider the principal value or use Fourier transform conventions, this integral is often taken as π δ(ω) + ... but since we are looking for the response at frequency ω, perhaps we need to consider the steady-state solution. \n\nAlternatively, in phasor notation, assuming the solution is of the form v = v₀ e^{-i ω t}, then substituting into the equation:\n\ndv/dt = -i ω v₀ e^{-i ω t} = - (e/m) E e^{-i ω t} \n\nTherefore:\n\n-i ω v₀ = - e/m E => v₀ = (e)/(i m ω ) E \n\nTherefore, v = (e)/(i m ω ) E e^{-i ω t} = - i (e)/(m ω ) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nTherefore, J = n e v = -i n e²/(m ω ) E \n\nTherefore, σ = -i n e²/(m ω ) \n\nAh! There's a sign difference. Earlier I had a positive i, but now with this phasor approach, I get a negative i. Where did I go wrong before?\n\nIn my previous derivation, I had:\n\nv(t) = (i e)/(m ω ) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nBut with this phasor approach, it's -i e/(m ω ) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nSo which is correct? Let me check the units again. The sign might depend on the definition of the electric field's time dependence. If E(t) = E₀ e^{-i ω t}, then the derivative d/dt = -i ω. \n\nLet me do the phasor method again. \n\nEquation of motion: m dv/dt = - e E \n\nIn phasor form, assuming v = v₀ e^{-i ω t}, E = E₀ e^{-i ω t}:\n\nm (-i ω v₀ e^{-i ω t}) = - e E₀ e^{-i ω t}\n\nCancel e^{-i ω t}:\n\n- i ω m v₀ = - e E₀ => v₀ = e/(i ω m ) E₀ \n\nTherefore, v₀ = -i e/(ω m ) E₀ \n\nTherefore, v(t) = -i e/(ω m ) E₀ e^{-i ω t}\n\nTherefore, J = n e v = -i n e²/(ω m ) E₀ e^{-i ω t} \n\nTherefore, σ = -i n e²/(ω m ) \n\nWhich is σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nBecause ω_pe² = n e²/(ε₀ m ), so n e²/m = ε₀ ω_pe² \n\nThus σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nAh! So there was a sign error in my previous calculation. Where did I go wrong before? Let me check. \n\nEarlier, I had:\n\ndv/dt = - (e/m) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nIntegrate to get v(t) = (i e)/(m ω ) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nBut according to the phasor method, it should be -i e/(m ω ) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nSo where is the mistake? Let me redo the integral.\n\nLet me compute the integral ∫_{-infty}^t e^{-i ω τ} dτ \n\nThis integral is equal to [ e^{-i ω τ}/(-i ω ) ] from -infty to t \n\nWhich is [ e^{-i ω t}/(-i ω ) - lim_{τ→-infty} e^{-i ω τ}/(-i ω ) ]\n\nAssuming that we are considering the Fourier transform in the sense of distributions, the integral of e^{-i ω τ} from -infty to t is π δ(ω) + (i / (2 ω )) sgn(ω) e^{-i ω t}... but maybe that's complicating. In the context of linear response, we can assume that the system is in steady state, so that the particular solution is what we are looking for. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as solving the differential equation with the driving force. The particular solution can be found by assuming v_p = A e^{-i ω t}\n\nThen dv_p/dt = -i ω A e^{-i ω t} = - (e/m) E e^{-i ω t} => A = e/(i ω m ) E \n\nTherefore, v_p = e/(i ω m ) E e^{-i ω t} = -i e/(ω m ) E e^{-i ω t}\n\nWhich is the same as the phasor method. Therefore, my initial integration had a sign error. I must have messed up the sign during integration. \n\nTherefore, the correct expression is σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nBut why is there a negative sign? Let me think physically. If the electric field is in some direction, the acceleration is opposite to the electric field (because m dv/dt = -e E; if e is positive, then acceleration is opposite to E). Therefore, the velocity should have a phase difference. \n\nBut with the negative sign in σ, how does that affect the current? Let me think. \n\nIf σ is -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω, then J = σ E. So if E is real, then J has a phase difference of -π/2 with respect to E. Which means that the current lags the electric field by π/2? Or leads?\n\nIn complex notation, multiplying by -i is equivalent to multiplying by e^{-i π/2}, which means that J lags E by π/2. \n\nIn a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by π/2, which corresponds to an impedance with a positive imaginary part. But here, the conductivity is negative imaginary, which would imply that the current lags the field by π/2. \n\nBut in the case of a plasma, when ω > ω_pe, the wave can propagate, and the plasma behaves like a dielectric with ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω². The conductivity can be related to the dielectric function. \n\nThe relation between conductivity and dielectric function is given by ε = 1 + i σ/(ε₀ ω ). \n\nWait, let me recall. In linear response, the displacement field D = ε₀ E + P, where P is the polarization. For a medium with free charges, the current density J is related to the movement of charges. \n\nAlternatively, in terms of Maxwell's equations, Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction is:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t \n\nIf we assume J = σ E, then:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ (σ E + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ ε₀ (σ/(ε₀ ω )) (-i ω E )\n\nWait, in frequency domain, ∂/∂t → -i ω. Therefore, \n\n∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ (-i ω E ) + μ₀ σ E \n\nTherefore:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ [ σ - i ω ε₀ ] E \n\nBut also, from the wave equation, we can relate this to the dielectric function. In a medium with dielectric function ε, we have D = ε₀ ε E, and then ∇×B = μ₀ ∂D/∂t = μ₀ ε₀ ε (-i ω ) E \n\nTherefore:\n\nμ₀ ε₀ ε (-i ω ) E = μ₀ [ σ - i ω ε₀ ] E \n\nDivide both sides by μ₀ E:\n\nε₀ ε (-i ω ) = σ - i ω ε₀ \n\nRearrange:\n\nσ = i ω ε₀ - i ω ε₀ ε \n\nσ = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε )\n\nTherefore, σ = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε )\n\nBut in our case, for plasma, the dielectric function is ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω². Therefore:\n\nσ = i ω ε₀ (1 - (1 - ω_pe² / ω² )) = i ω ε₀ (ω_pe² / ω² ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nBut according to this, σ is positive imaginary. However, earlier from the equation of motion, we found σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. There is a discrepancy in the sign. \n\nWhere is the mistake here? Let me check the relation between σ and ε. \n\nStarting again, D = ε₀ E + P. The polarization P is related to the bound charges. However, in a medium with free charges, the current J is also present. \n\nIn terms of constitutive relations, for a medium with both polarization and conduction current, we can write:\n\nD = ε₀ E + P \n\nand \n\nJ = σ E \n\nBut how does P relate to E? For linear media, P = χ_e ε₀ E, so D = ε₀ (1 + χ_e ) E = ε₀ ε_r E. However, in our case, the polarization might be due to the displacement of charges. Wait, but in a plasma, the charges are free, so their motion contributes to the current J, not to the polarization. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the displacement current and the conduction current are both present. \n\nIn the plasma, the current J comes from the free charges. The polarization P would be zero if we consider only free charges moving as a current. Therefore, D = ε₀ E. Then Ampere's law is:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t \n\nBut J comes from the free charges. \n\nFrom our previous result, we have J = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω E \n\nTherefore, substituting into Ampere's law:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ (-i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω ) E + μ₀ ε₀ (-i ω ) E \n\nFactor out μ₀ ε₀ (-i ω ) E:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ (-i ω ) E [ ε₀ ω_pe² / (ω² ε₀ ) + 1 ] \n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nFirst term: μ₀ (-i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω ) E \n\nSecond term: μ₀ ε₀ (-i ω ) E \n\nSo altogether:\n\nμ₀ (-i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω - i ω ε₀ ) E \n\nFactor out μ₀ (-i ε₀ ) E:\n\nμ₀ (-i ε₀ ) E [ ω_pe² / ω + ω ] \n\nWhich is:\n\n- i μ₀ ε₀ E [ ω_pe² / ω + ω ] \n\nBut from the wave equation approach earlier, we had:\n\n∇×B = i k B = ... leading to the dispersion relation. \n\nAlternatively, using the dielectric function approach, if we define ε such that ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ε (-i ω ) E, then:\n\nμ₀ ε₀ ε (-i ω ) E = - i μ₀ ε₀ E [ ω_pe² / ω + ω ] \n\nCancel terms:\n\nε (-i ω ) = - i [ ω_pe² / ω + ω ] \n\nMultiply both sides by -i:\n\nε ω = ω_pe² / ω + ω \n\nTherefore:\n\nε = [ ω_pe² / ω² + 1 ] \n\nBut this contradicts the known dielectric function ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω². \n\nClearly, there is a sign error somewhere. Let me trace back. \n\nEarlier, from the equation of motion, we found J = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω E \n\nBut according to the dielectric function relation, if ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², then from σ = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε ) = i ω ε₀ (ω_pe² / ω² ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nBut according to our equation of motion, σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nTherefore, there is a sign discrepancy. This suggests that there is an error in one of the derivations. \n\nLet me check the derivation of σ from the equation of motion again. \n\nFrom the equation of motion: m dv/dt = -e E \n\nAssuming E = E₀ e^{-i ω t}, then dv/dt = -e E / m \n\nIntegrate to get v = - (e / (i ω m )) E \n\nTherefore, J = n e v = - n e² / (i ω m ) E \n\nWhich is J = i n e² / (ω m ) E \n\nBecause 1/i = -i \n\nTherefore, σ = i n e² / (ω m ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nAh! Here is the mistake! Earlier, I had said v = -i e/(m ω ) E, but when calculating J = n e v, that would be J = -i n e²/(m ω ) E. However, 1/i = -i, so -i = i * (-1)/i = ... Wait, let me compute:\n\nIf v = -i e/(m ω ) E, then J = n e v = -i n e²/(m ω ) E \n\nBut -i = i * (-1)/i = i * i^2 = i * (-1) ??? Wait, no. \n\nWait, -i = i * (-1). But in terms of expressing as a positive imaginary unit, note that -i = i * (-1) = i * e^{i π} = e^{-i π/2} e^{i π} = e^{i π/2} = i ??? No, this is confusing. \n\nLet me just compute the expression:\n\nJ = -i n e²/(m ω ) E \n\nBut σ = J / E = -i n e²/(m ω ) \n\nBut n e²/m = ε₀ ω_pe² \n\nTherefore, σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nBut earlier, from the dielectric function approach, we have σ = +i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nThere is a contradiction. \n\nLet me check another source. In the Drude model, the conductivity is σ = [i ω_pe² ε₀ ] / [ω (ω + i γ )]. For γ = 0, this is σ = i ω_pe² ε₀ / ω. \n\nBut according to our equation of motion, we have a negative sign. Where is the error? \n\nLet me check the equation of motion. The force on the electron is F = -e E. But the current is J = n e v. However, if the charges are electrons, then e would be negative. But in the problem statement, it says the charges have charge e. It doesn't specify if e is positive or negative. If e is the charge of the particle, and if it's an electron, e is negative. However, in our derivation, we treated e as a positive constant. \n\nBut in the plasma frequency definition, ω_pe² = n e² / (ε₀ m ), which is positive regardless of the sign of e. \n\nLet me assume that e is positive. Then, if the electric field is in the +x direction, the force on the particle is -e E, which would be in the -x direction. Therefore, the acceleration is in the -x direction. Integrating, the velocity would be in the -x direction. Therefore, the current J = n e v would be in the -x direction, opposite to E. \n\nBut in terms of complex numbers, with the time dependence e^{-i ω t}, the relation between J and E would have a phase factor. \n\nLet me think in terms of energy. If the current is out of phase with the electric field, whether it leads or lags determines if the medium is capacitive or inductive. \n\nBut let's think about the dielectric function. If ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², then for ω > ω_pe, ε is positive, and the wave can propagate. For ω < ω_pe, ε is negative, and the wave is evanescent. \n\nFrom the relation σ = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε ), if ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², then:\n\nσ = i ω ε₀ (ω_pe² / ω² ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nWhich is positive imaginary. This suggests that the conductivity is such that the current leads the electric field by π/2 (since multiplying by +i is e^{+i π/2}). \n\nBut from the equation of motion, we have σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω, which would mean current lags by π/2. \n\nThis contradiction suggests a sign error in one of the derivations. \n\nLet me go back to the equation of motion. Let me use a different approach. \n\nAssume the electric field is E(t) = E₀ e^{-i ω t}. \n\nThe equation of motion for an electron (assuming e is negative, but let's keep e as a positive constant for now, and later consider the actual charge):\n\nm dv/dt = -e E(t) \n\nSolution for v(t) is v(t) = v₀ e^{-i ω t} \n\nPlugging in:\n\nm (-i ω v₀ e^{-i ω t}) = -e E₀ e^{-i ω t} \n\n=> -i ω m v₀ = -e E₀ \n\n=> v₀ = e / (i ω m ) E₀ \n\nTherefore, v(t) = e / (i ω m ) E₀ e^{-i ω t} = -i e / (ω m ) E₀ e^{-i ω t} \n\nTherefore, J = n e v = -i n e² / (ω m ) E₀ e^{-i ω t} \n\nSo σ = -i n e² / (ω m ) \n\nBut n e²/m = ε₀ ω_pe² \n\nTherefore, σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nBut according to the dielectric function approach, σ should be +i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nWhere is the mistake? Let me check the relation between σ and ε. \n\nEarlier, I said that ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t \n\nIf J = σ E, then:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ σ E + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t \n\nIn frequency domain, this is:\n\n∇×B = μ₀ σ E - i ω μ₀ ε₀ E \n\nBut also, from the wave equation, if we assume D = ε₀ ε E, then ∇×B = μ₀ ∂D/∂t = -i ω μ₀ ε₀ ε E \n\nTherefore:\n\n- i ω μ₀ ε₀ ε E = μ₀ σ E - i ω μ₀ ε₀ E \n\nDivide both sides by μ₀ E:\n\n- i ω ε₀ ε = σ - i ω ε₀ \n\nRearranged:\n\nσ = i ω ε₀ - i ω ε₀ ε = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε )\n\nSo σ = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε )\n\nIf ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², then σ = i ω ε₀ (ω_pe² / ω² ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nBut from the equation of motion, we have σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nThis suggests that either the sign in the equation of motion is wrong, or the relation between σ and ε is wrong. \n\nLet me check the standard result. In plasma physics, the dielectric function is indeed ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², and the conductivity is related to it. \n\nFrom the relation σ = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε ), if ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², then σ = i ω ε₀ (ω_pe² / ω² ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nBut according to our equation of motion, σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nThis suggests that there is a missing negative sign in our equation of motion derivation. \n\nLet me revisit the equation of motion. The key step is m dv/dt = -e E \n\nBut if the charges are electrons, their charge is -|e|. Let me define e as the magnitude of the charge, and the actual charge is -e. Let me redefine: let the charge be -e, where e > 0. Then the equation of motion is:\n\nm dv/dt = -(-e) E = e E \n\nWait, no: force is F = q E. If the charge is -e, then F = -e E. \n\nSo m dv/dt = -e E \n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So the equation of motion is the same, regardless of the sign of the charge, as long as e is the magnitude. \n\nBut in our derivation, we obtained σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω, but according to the dielectric function, it should be +i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nLet me check the current direction. If the electric field is in the +x direction, and the charges are electrons (-e), then the force on them is -e E, which is in the -x direction. Therefore, the acceleration is in the -x direction. The velocity, after integrating, would be in the -x direction. Therefore, the current J = n e v would be in the -x direction. But if E is in +x, and J is in -x, then J = -σ E, where σ is positive. But in our case, we have J = σ E, so σ would be negative. \n\nBut in complex notation, we have J = σ E. If J is in the -x direction, and E is in +x, then σ is negative real. But in our case, σ is imaginary. \n\nWait, let me think in terms of complex numbers. Suppose E is real, oscillating as E(t) = E₀ cos(ω t). Let me take the real part of our complex expressions. \n\nIf σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω, then J = σ E = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω * E₀ e^{-i ω t} \n\nTaking real parts, if E(t) = E₀ cos(ω t) = Re[E₀ e^{-i ω t}], then J(t) = Re[ -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω * E₀ e^{-i ω t} ] = Re[ ε₀ ω_pe² / ω * E₀ e^{-i (ω t - π/2)} ] = ε₀ ω_pe² / ω * E₀ cos(ω t - π/2) = ε₀ ω_pe² / ω * E₀ sin(ω t) \n\nSo the current is in phase with the derivative of the electric field, which is characteristic of a capacitive current, where the current leads the voltage by π/2. But in this case, the current leads the electric field by π/2. \n\nBut according to the dielectric function ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², for ω > ω_pe, ε is positive, and the wave can propagate. For a positive ε, the medium is dielectric, and the relation between D and E is D = ε₀ ε E. In this case, the conductivity is related to the dielectric function as σ = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε ). If ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², then σ = i ω ε₀ (ω_pe² / ω² ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω, which would mean that the current leads the electric field by π/2, which is what we have in our equation of motion result when we take σ = +i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. But our equation of motion gave σ = -i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω, which would lead to current lagging by π/2. \n\nThis suggests that there is a sign error in our equation of motion derivation. Where? \n\nLet me go back to the equation of motion. Let me use a different convention for the time dependence. Sometimes, the time dependence is taken as e^{+i ω t} instead of e^{-i ω t}. Let me check if this could be the source of the sign error. \n\nIn our derivation, we assumed E(t) = E₀ e^{-i ω t}. Let's instead assume E(t) = E₀ e^{+i ω t}. Then, the derivative d/dt = +i ω. Let's redo the equation of motion with this convention. \n\nEquation of motion: m dv/dt = -e E \n\nAssume v = v₀ e^{+i ω t}, E = E₀ e^{+i ω t} \n\nThen: m (i ω v₀ e^{+i ω t}) = -e E₀ e^{+i ω t} \n\n=> i ω m v₀ = -e E₀ \n\n=> v₀ = -e / (i ω m ) E₀ = i e / (ω m ) E₀ \n\nTherefore, v = i e / (ω m ) E₀ e^{+i ω t} \n\nThen J = n e v = i n e² / (ω m ) E₀ e^{+i ω t} \n\nThus σ = i n e² / (ω m ) = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω \n\nWhich matches the dielectric function result! \n\nAh! The issue is the convention for the time dependence. In our initial derivation, we used e^{-i ω t}, which led to a negative sign, but with e^{+i ω t}, we get the positive sign. \n\nTherefore, the discrepancy is due to the choice of the time dependence convention. In physics, both conventions are used, and it's important to be consistent. \n\nIn many electromagnetism texts, the time dependence is taken as e^{-i ω t}, but in other contexts, it might be e^{+i ω t}. The key is to be consistent with the convention when deriving equations. \n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the convention, but the standard dispersion relation for plasma is ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², which is derived assuming the correct sign, it suggests that the conductivity should be σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nTherefore, the error in our initial derivation using e^{-i ω t} was in the sign, likely due to inconsistency with the convention used in the dielectric function derivation. \n\nTo resolve this, let's stick with the standard result. Given that the plasma dielectric function is ε = 1 - ω_pe² / ω², and using the relation σ = i ω ε₀ (1 - ε ), we get σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the conductivity is σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nTo confirm, let's look at the units and the physical meaning. If the conductivity is positive imaginary, it implies that the medium is storing energy in the electric field, similar to a capacitor, which makes sense for a plasma where the free charges oscillate in response to the electric field without dissipation. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nBut let me check one more source. In the book \"Introduction to Plasma Physics\" by Francis F. Chen, the conductivity tensor for a cold plasma is derived. For simplicity, considering electrons and assuming no collisions, the electric conductivity is given by σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / (ω), which matches our corrected result. \n\nYes, for example, in a cold, collisionless plasma, the conductivity tensor components are indeed σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. This is because the displacement current dominates, and there is no dissipation (since γ = 0). \n\nTherefore, the correct expression for σ is σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\nSo, to summarize, after correcting the sign issue due to the time dependence convention, the conductivity of the dilute plasma as a function of ω is σ = i ε₀ ω_pe² / ω. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe conductivity is \\boxed{\\sigma = i \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}}^2}{\\omega}}.\n</think>"}
