The gravitational force is given by:\n\n$$\nF_{\\text{gravity}} = \\frac{G M m}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,\n- $ M $ is the mass of the star,\n- $ m $ is the mass of the planet,\n- $ r $ is the orbital radius.\n\nThe centripetal force required for circular motion is:\n\n$$\nF_{\\text{centripetal}} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\n$$\n\nEquating the two forces:\n\n$$\n\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\n$$\n\nCanceling the mass of the planet $ m $ from both sides:\n\n$$\n\\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r}\n$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $ r $:\n\n$$\n\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\n$$\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Interpretation of the Result**\n\nFrom the derived formula, the **linear velocity $ v $** of the planet depends on:\n- The **mass of the star $ M $**,\n- The **orbital radius $ r $**.\n\nThe **mass of the planet $ m $** cancels out, meaning it does **not** affect the linear velocity. Additionally, the **radius of the star** is not a factor in the derivation.\n\n---\n\n### **Correct Option**\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which option correctly relates the linear velocity of a planet revolving around a star in circular motion. The options are about the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital radius, and the radius of the star. Let me start by recalling what I know about circular motion and gravitational forces.\n\nFirst, when a planet orbits a star, the gravitational force between them provides the centripetal force necessary for the circular motion. The formula for gravitational force is F = G*(M*m)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star, m is the mass of the planet, and r is the distance between their centers, which in this case would be the orbital radius.\n\nOn the other hand, the centripetal force required for circular motion is given by F = m*v²/r, where m is the mass of the planet, v is its linear velocity, and r is the orbital radius. Since the gravitational force acts as the centripetal force, I can set these two equations equal to each other:\n\nG*(M*m)/r² = m*v²/r\n\nHmm, let me check that. If I simplify this equation, the m on both sides cancels out. So that gives:\n\nG*M/r² = v²/r\n\nThen multiplying both sides by r:\n\nG*M/r = v²\n\nSo solving for v, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(G*M/r)\n\nWait, so the velocity v depends on the square root of the mass of the star (M) divided by the orbital radius (r). The mass of the planet (m) cancels out, so it doesn't affect the velocity. The radius of the star itself isn't mentioned here; it's the orbital radius that matters. So the velocity depends on the mass of the star and the orbital radius. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption C says \"The mass of the star and the orbital radius of the planet.\" That matches what I derived. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The key here is that the gravitational force provides the centripetal force, and when you set them equal, the planet's mass cancels out. So the velocity doesn't depend on the planet's mass. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C. Let me just think if there's any other factor I might have missed. The radius of the star (D's second part) isn't part of the equation here; the orbital radius is separate. So yes, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
