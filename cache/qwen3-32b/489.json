For oxygen:\n\n- In **acidic conditions**, the reduction reaction is:\n  $$\n  \\text{O}_2 + 4\\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\quad (E^\\circ = +1.23\\ \\text{V})\n  $$\n- In **basic conditions**, the reduction reaction is:\n  $$\n  \\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 4e^- \\rightarrow 4\\text{OH}^- \\quad (E^\\circ = +0.40\\ \\text{V})\n  $$\n\nThe lower standard potential in basic solutions indicates that oxygen is **a weaker oxidant** in basic environments. Thus, the first blank should be filled with **\"weaker\"**.\n\n---\n\n### **Kinetic Consideration (Acidic Solutions)**\n\nKinetically, the rate of a reaction depends on factors like activation energy and the availability of reaction participants. In acidic solutions:\n\n- Protons (H⁺) are more abundant.\n- The reaction pathway for oxygen reduction is more favorable due to the presence of H⁺ ions, which participate in the reaction.\n- This leads to **faster** reaction rates in acidic environments.\n\nTherefore, the second blank should be filled with **\"faster\"**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Statement and Answer**\n\nThe completed statement becomes:\n\n> \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\"\n\nThis matches **Option A: weaker – faster**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer: **A: weaker – faster**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about oxygen acting as an oxidant in basic vs. acidic solutions, both thermodynamically and kinetically. The student has to choose the correct combination of terms for the blanks. The options are A: weaker – faster, B: weaker – slower, C: stronger – faster, D: stronger – slower.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some electrochemistry concepts. Thermodynamic stability of oxygen as an oxidizing agent depends on the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant because the standard reduction potential for O2 to H2O is higher. The reaction in acidic conditions is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O with a standard reduction potential of around +1.23 V. In basic solutions, the reaction would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- with a standard potential of about +0.40 V. So, since the potential is lower in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically there. So the first blank should be \"weaker\".\n\nNow, the kinetic part. Kinetically, the rate of reaction depends on the activation energy and the conditions. In acidic solutions, the presence of H+ ions might facilitate the reaction by providing protons needed for the reduction process. Lower pH (acidic) might lead to faster reactions because the protons are more available, lowering the activation energy. So in acidic solutions, oxygen reacts faster kinetically. Therefore, the second blank should be \"faster\".\n\nPutting it together: Thermodynamically weaker in basic, kinetically faster in acidic. So the combination is weaker – faster, which is option A. Wait, but the question says \"in basic solutions\" for the first part and \"in acidic solutions\" for the second. So the first blank is about basic solutions (weaker), the second is about acidic solutions (faster). Therefore, the correct answer would be A: weaker – faster.\n\nBut let me double-check. Thermodynamically, in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant. So the first blank is \"weaker\". Kinetically, in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster. So the second blank is \"faster\". Therefore, the answer is A: weaker – faster. Hmm, but wait, the options are presented as first blank (thermodynamic) and second blank (kinetic). So the first part is about basic solutions, the second about acidic. So the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.\" So the combination is weaker – faster, which is option A. That seems right.\n</think>"}
