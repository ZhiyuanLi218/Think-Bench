A pure substance consists of **only one type of atom or molecule** and has a **fixed composition and distinct chemical properties**. This includes **elements** (e.g., oxygen, gold) and **compounds** (e.g., water, sodium chloride), but **not mixtures**, which can have variable compositions.\n\nLet’s examine each option:\n\n---\n\n**(A) Gasoline**  \nGasoline is a **mixture** of various **hydrocarbons** (like octane, heptane, and others). Its composition can vary depending on the refining process and the grade of gasoline. Therefore, it is **not a pure substance**.\n\n---\n\n**(B) Vinegar**  \nVinegar is primarily a **solution** of **acetic acid in water**, with possible additives or flavoring agents. Since it is a **homogeneous mixture** (a solution), it is **not a pure substance**.\n\n---\n\n**(C) Bleaching powder**  \nBleaching powder typically refers to **calcium hypochlorite**, which **is a pure compound**. However, in some commercial contexts, it may refer to a **mixture** containing calcium hypochlorite along with other substances like calcium chloride and calcium hydroxide. This ambiguity makes it **less certain** whether it is a pure substance in all contexts.\n\n---\n\n**(D) Baking soda**  \nBaking soda is **sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃)**, a **single, well-defined chemical compound**. It has a **fixed composition** and **distinct chemical properties**, making it a **pure substance**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer: **(D) Baking soda**  \nBaking soda is the only option that is a **pure substance**, as it is a single compound with a fixed chemical composition.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the options is a pure substance. Let me start by recalling what a pure substance is. From what I remember, a pure substance is a material that has a consistent composition and distinct chemical properties. It can be an element or a compound, right? So elements are pure substances made of one type of atom, and compounds are made of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio. Mixtures, on the other hand, are combinations of two or more substances where each retains its own properties and can vary in proportion.\n\nNow, looking at the options: Gasoline, Vinegar, Bleaching powder, and Baking soda. Let me go through each one by one.\n\nGasoline: I know gasoline is a fuel for cars. I think it's a mixture of different hydrocarbons. Since it's a mixture, it's not a pure substance. So A is probably not the answer.\n\nVinegar: Vinegar is something you use in cooking. I remember that vinegar is mostly acetic acid dissolved in water, along with some other flavoring agents. So that sounds like a mixture. Acetic acid is a compound, but vinegar itself is a solution, which is a type of homogeneous mixture. So B is likely a mixture, not a pure substance.\n\nBleaching powder: I'm a bit less sure about this one. Bleaching powder is used for cleaning and disinfecting. I think it's a mixture of different chemicals, maybe calcium hypochlorite and other compounds. If it's a mixture, then it's not a pure substance. But I need to confirm. Wait, sometimes commercial products have names that might be a single compound. Let me think. Bleaching powder is typically calcium hypochlorite, but maybe in some contexts it's a mixture. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should check the other option first.\n\nBaking soda: Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, right? I remember that sodium bicarbonate is a compound with the formula NaHCO3. It's a single chemical compound, so it's a pure substance. So D is a pure substance.\n\nComparing with the other options, if D is baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), then it's a pure substance. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the bleaching powder. Let me think again. If bleaching powder is calcium hypochlorite, then that's a single compound. However, sometimes bleaching powder refers to a mixture of compounds. For example, in some contexts, it's a mixture of calcium hypochlorite, calcium chloride, and calcium hydroxide. So depending on the exact composition, it could be a mixture. But if the question is from a textbook or standard exam, it's more likely that they consider baking soda as a pure substance. So between C and D, D is more likely the correct answer.\n\nYes, I think D is the correct choice here. Baking soda is a compound, so it's a pure substance. The other options are mixtures.\n</think>"}
