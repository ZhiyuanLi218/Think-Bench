They satisfy three equations: xyz = 1, x + 1/z = 5, y + 1/x = 29, and I need to find z + 1/y, which will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n. Alright, let me start by writing down all the given equations and see how I can relate them.\n\nFirst, the equations:\n\n1. $ xyz = 1 $\n2. $ x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5 $\n3. $ y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29 $\n4. Find $ z + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{m}{n} $, then m + n.\n\nSince there are three variables and three equations, it should be solvable. Let me think about how to manipulate these equations.\n\nStarting with equation 2: $ x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5 $. Maybe I can express 1/z in terms of x? Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation 2: $ \\frac{1}{z} = 5 - x $. Therefore, $ z = \\frac{1}{5 - x} $.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3: $ y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29 $. Let me solve for y here: $ y = 29 - \\frac{1}{x} $.\n\nNow, since we have expressions for z and y in terms of x, maybe we can plug them into equation 1, which is $ xyz = 1 $.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n$ x \\times y \\times z = 1 $\n\nSubstituting y and z:\n\n$ x \\times \\left(29 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5 - x}\\right) = 1 $\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. First, multiply x with the term in the first parenthesis:\n\n$ x \\times \\left(29 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 29x - 1 $\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n$ (29x - 1) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5 - x}\\right) = 1 $\n\nMultiply both sides by (5 - x) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n$ 29x - 1 = 5 - x $\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n29x - 1 - 5 + x = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n30x - 6 = 0\n\nSo, 30x = 6 => x = 6 / 30 = 1/5.\n\nWait, x = 1/5? Let me check if that makes sense. Let me verify if substituting back into equation 2 gives a valid z.\n\nFrom equation 2: x + 1/z = 5. If x is 1/5, then 1/z = 5 - 1/5 = 24/5, so z = 5/24. That seems okay.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3: y + 1/x = 29. Since x = 1/5, 1/x = 5. Therefore, y = 29 - 5 = 24. So y = 24. Let me check if xyz = 1.\n\nx is 1/5, y is 24, z is 5/24. Multiply them: (1/5) * 24 * (5/24). Let's compute:\n\n(1/5) * 24 * (5/24) = (1/5)*(5/24)*24 = (1/5)*5 = 1. Yes, that works. So the values are consistent.\n\nSo now, we need to find z + 1/y. Let's compute that.\n\nz is 5/24, and 1/y is 1/24. Therefore, z + 1/y = 5/24 + 1/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Wait, 1/4? But 1/4 is 0.25. But let me check again.\n\nWait, z is 5/24 and 1/y is 1/24? Wait, y is 24, so 1/y is 1/24. Then z + 1/y is 5/24 + 1/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. So that would be m/n = 1/4, so m + n = 5? But 1 and 4 are coprime, so yes. But that seems too straightforward. Is this correct?\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other steps where I might have made a mistake. Let me go through again.\n\nStarting with equation 2: x + 1/z = 5. Solved for z: z = 1/(5 - x). Then equation 3: y = 29 - 1/x. Then plug into xyz = 1:\n\nx*(29 - 1/x)*(1/(5 - x)) = 1. Then simplifying:\n\nMultiply x into (29 - 1/x): 29x - 1. Then divide by (5 - x): (29x - 1)/(5 - x) = 1. Multiply both sides by (5 - x):\n\n29x - 1 = 5 - x. Then 29x + x = 5 + 1 => 30x = 6 => x = 1/5. Then y = 29 - 1/x = 29 - 5 = 24. z = 1/(5 - x) = 1/(5 - 1/5) = 1/(24/5) = 5/24. Then z + 1/y = 5/24 + 1/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. So m/n is 1/4, so m + n = 5. But the problem says \"three positive numbers\" and all steps seem okay. But maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, but 1/4 seems too simple for an Olympiad problem. Maybe I need to check again?\n\nWait, let me check z + 1/y again. z is 5/24, 1/y is 1/24. So adding them gives 6/24 = 1/4. So 1/4 is correct? Let me check if there's an alternative way to get z + 1/y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another relation. Let me think. Since xyz = 1, so z = 1/(xy). Let me try expressing z + 1/y in terms of x and y.\n\nz + 1/y = 1/(xy) + 1/y = (1 + x)/xy. Wait, because 1/(xy) + 1/y = (1 + x)/xy. But since xyz = 1, then xy = 1/z. Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, since we know x and y, maybe just compute directly. But we already did that. So seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach the problem. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nLet me consider that xyz = 1. So we can write variables in terms of each other. Let me try expressing everything in terms of z.\n\nFrom equation 2: x + 1/z = 5 => x = 5 - 1/z.\n\nFrom equation 1: xyz = 1 => (5 - 1/z) * y * z = 1 => (5z - 1) * y = 1 => y = 1/(5z - 1).\n\nThen equation 3: y + 1/x = 29. Let's plug in y and x:\n\ny = 1/(5z - 1), and 1/x = 1/(5 - 1/z) = z/(5z - 1). Therefore, equation 3 becomes:\n\n1/(5z - 1) + z/(5z - 1) = 29. Combine the terms:\n\n(1 + z)/(5z - 1) = 29. Therefore:\n\n1 + z = 29*(5z - 1)\n\nExpand the right side: 145z - 29\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n1 + z - 145z + 29 = 0 => 1 + 29 - 144z = 0 => 30 - 144z = 0 => 144z = 30 => z = 30/144 = 5/24. Which is same as before. Then z = 5/24. Then 1/y = 5z - 1 from earlier? Wait, y = 1/(5z - 1). Therefore, 1/y = 5z - 1. So z + 1/y = z + 5z - 1 = 6z - 1. Let me check that:\n\nIf z + 1/y = z + (5z - 1) = 6z - 1. Since z = 5/24, then 6*(5/24) - 1 = 30/24 - 1 = 5/4 - 1 = 1/4. Same result. So that's consistent. So that gives same answer. Therefore, answer is 1/4, m + n = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"three positive numbers\", and all steps are consistent. Maybe it's correct? Maybe the answer is 5? Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if z + 1/y is indeed 1/4. Given z = 5/24 and y = 24. Then 1/y = 1/24. So z + 1/y = 5/24 + 1/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Yes. So that's correct. Therefore, m/n is 1/4, so m + n is 5. Therefore, the answer is 5. But let me check if 1 and 4 are coprime. Yes, they are. So 5 is the answer. But maybe I need to check if the problem is from an Olympiad, maybe expecting a harder answer? Maybe I made a miscalculation?\n\nWait, let me check the equations again with x = 1/5, y = 24, z = 5/24.\n\nCheck equation 2: x + 1/z = 1/5 + 24/5 = 25/5 = 5. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: y + 1/x = 24 + 5 = 29. Correct.\n\nEquation 1: xyz = (1/5)*24*(5/24) = 1. Correct. All equations are satisfied. Therefore, z + 1/y = 1/4. Therefore, answer is 5.\n\nBut maybe the problem is designed to trick us? Let me think again. Maybe there is another solution?\n\nWait, suppose that when solving 29x - 1 = 5 - x, leading to 30x = 6, x = 1/5. Is there another solution? For example, if I made a mistake in signs? Let me check.\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying both sides by (5 - x):\n\n29x - 1 = 5 - x. Then adding x to both sides and adding 1 to both sides:\n\n30x = 6. So x = 6/30 = 1/5. Correct. So no mistake here. Therefore, unique solution. Since all variables are positive, we need to check that denominators are not zero and variables positive.\n\nFor x = 1/5, then 5 - x = 5 - 1/5 = 24/5 > 0, so z is positive. y = 29 - 1/x = 29 - 5 = 24 > 0. All variables are positive. Therefore, unique solution. Therefore, answer is 1/4. Therefore, m + n is 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if there is an alternative interpretation of the problem? For example, maybe equations are different? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"Suppose that x, y, and z are three positive numbers that satisfy the equations xyz = 1, x + 1/z = 5, and y + 1/x = 29. Then z + 1/y = m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n.\"\n\nNo, the problem is as I interpreted. Therefore, unless there is a calculation mistake, which I can't find, answer is 5.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscalculated z + 1/y? Let me check again. z is 5/24, 1/y is 1/24. Adding them: 5/24 + 1/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Yes. So 1/4. Therefore, m + n is 1 + 4 = 5. So answer is 5.\n\nBut maybe the problem is from an old contest, and maybe answer is different? Wait, but I need to trust my calculations here. Since all steps check out. Therefore, maybe the answer is 5. Therefore, I think the answer is 5.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me try another approach. Let me consider multiplying all three equations or something.\n\nWe have:\n\nEquation 2: x + 1/z = 5. Let me note that 1/z = xy, since xyz = 1. Therefore, 1/z = xy. Therefore, equation 2 can be written as x + xy = 5 => x(1 + y) = 5. Similarly, equation 3: y + 1/x = 29. Since 1/x = yz (because xyz = 1 => 1/x = yz). Therefore, equation 3 can be written as y + yz = 29 => y(1 + z) = 29. Similarly, if we want to write equation for z + 1/y, note that 1/y = xz. Therefore, z + xz = z(1 + x). So if we can find z(1 + x), that would be the desired value.\n\nSo let me note:\n\nFrom equation 2: x(1 + y) = 5.\n\nFrom equation 3: y(1 + z) = 29.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me call equation 2 as: x(y + 1) = 5. Equation 3: y(z + 1) = 29. And we need to find z(x + 1).\n\nLet me denote A = x(y + 1) = 5, B = y(z + 1) = 29, and we need to find C = z(x + 1) = ?\n\nLet me try to relate these three expressions. Since xyz = 1.\n\nLet me express A, B, C in terms of each other.\n\nFirst, note that A = x(y + 1) = xy + x. Since xyz = 1, then xy = 1/z. Therefore, A = 1/z + x. But that's exactly equation 2. Which checks out. Similarly for B.\n\nBut perhaps multiplying A, B, C?\n\nBut maybe if I can find relations between them.\n\nLet me write:\n\nFrom A: x(y + 1) = 5 => x = 5 / (y + 1)\n\nFrom B: y(z + 1) = 29 => z + 1 = 29 / y => z = (29 / y) - 1\n\nFrom xyz = 1: x * y * z = 1. Substitute x and z:\n\n[5 / (y + 1)] * y * [ (29 / y) - 1 ] = 1\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, simplify [ (29 / y) - 1 ] = (29 - y)/y.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n[5 / (y + 1)] * y * [ (29 - y)/y ] = 1\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nThe y in the numerator and denominator cancels:\n\n[5 / (y + 1)] * [29 - y] = 1\n\nTherefore:\n\n5*(29 - y) / (y + 1) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by (y + 1):\n\n5*(29 - y) = y + 1\n\nExpand left side:\n\n145 - 5y = y + 1\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n145 - 5y - y - 1 = 0 => 144 - 6y = 0 => 6y = 144 => y = 24. Which is same as before. Therefore, y = 24. Then from equation B: z + 1 = 29 / y = 29 / 24 => z = 29/24 - 1 = 5/24. Same as before. Then x = 5 / (y + 1) = 5 / (24 + 1) = 5 / 25 = 1/5. Same as before. Therefore, again, z + 1/y = 5/24 + 1/24 = 1/4. Therefore, same result. Therefore, answer is 5. Therefore, I think this confirms that answer is indeed 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if there's another way people might approach this problem and perhaps get a different answer? For example, suppose someone tried substitution in another order?\n\nAlternatively, let me try expressing variables in terms of z. Wait, already did that. Or in terms of y?\n\nAlternatively, since xyz = 1, take logarithms? Probably not helpful here, since equations are additive and multiplicative.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as reciprocals. Let me define a = 1/x, b = 1/y, c = 1/z. Then, since xyz = 1, then (1/a)(1/b)(1/c) = 1 => 1/(abc) = 1 => abc = 1.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nEquation 2: x + 1/z = 5 => 1/a + c = 5.\n\nEquation 3: y + 1/x = 29 => 1/b + a = 29.\n\nWe need to find z + 1/y = c + b.\n\nSo now, variables a, b, c with abc = 1, 1/a + c = 5, 1/b + a = 29, find b + c.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nFrom 1/a + c = 5 => c = 5 - 1/a.\n\nFrom 1/b + a = 29 => 1/b = 29 - a => b = 1/(29 - a).\n\nFrom abc = 1 => a * b * c = 1. Substitute b and c:\n\na * [1/(29 - a)] * [5 - 1/a] = 1.\n\nCompute:\n\nMultiply terms:\n\n[a / (29 - a)] * [5 - 1/a] = 1.\n\nSimplify [5 - 1/a] = (5a - 1)/a. Therefore:\n\n[a / (29 - a)] * [(5a - 1)/a] = [ (5a - 1) / (29 - a) ] = 1.\n\nTherefore, 5a - 1 = 29 - a => 5a + a = 29 + 1 => 6a = 30 => a = 5. Therefore, a = 5. Therefore, from equation for b: b = 1/(29 - a) = 1/(29 - 5) = 1/24. From equation for c: c = 5 - 1/a = 5 - 1/5 = 24/5. Therefore, need to find b + c = 1/24 + 24/5. Wait, hold on. Wait, z + 1/y = c + b? Wait, original variables:\n\nz + 1/y = c + b? Wait, z is 1/c? Wait, c = 1/z? Wait, original substitution: c = 1/z? Wait no, c was defined as 1/z? Wait:\n\nOriginal substitution: a = 1/x, b = 1/y, c = 1/z. Therefore, z = 1/c. Therefore, z + 1/y = 1/c + b. Which is b + 1/c. Wait, but earlier I thought it was b + c. Wait, no, I must have miscalculated here.\n\nWait, the problem asks for z + 1/y. Since z = 1/c, and 1/y = b. Therefore, z + 1/y = 1/c + b. But in this substitution approach, I need to calculate 1/c + b.\n\nBut from above, c = 5 - 1/a = 5 - 1/5 = 24/5. Therefore, 1/c = 5/24. And b = 1/24. Therefore, z + 1/y = 5/24 + 1/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Same as before. Therefore, same answer. Therefore, no problem here. Therefore, answer is 1/4. So m + n is 5. Therefore, I think this confirms again that answer is 5.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5. Maybe I was overthinking because I thought it might be a trick question, but all approaches lead to the same result, so I think it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>"}
