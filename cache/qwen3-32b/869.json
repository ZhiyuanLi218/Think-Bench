So, the setup is a double-slit apparatus where white light is used, which produces interference fringes. Now, the question is what happens when we add a red filter between the light source and the single slit. The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a double-slit interference works with white light. Normally, when you use white light in a double-slit experiment, the interference pattern is a bit different than with monochromatic light. White light is a combination of all visible wavelengths, so each wavelength produces its own set of interference fringes. The central maximum (zeroth order) is white because all the colors overlap there. Then, for the first-order maxima, different colors will be at different positions because their wavelengths are different. This results in colored fringes, with red (longer wavelength) on the outside and blue (shorter wavelength) on the inside. Beyond the first order, the fringes overlap because the different wavelengths don't align, so the higher-order fringes become less distinct and eventually the colors blend together, making the pattern hard to see.\n\nNow, adding a red filter between the light source and the single slit. A red filter allows only red light (or at least the red wavelengths) to pass through and blocks other colors. So if we put a red filter, the light that reaches the single slit is predominantly red. Therefore, the light passing through the single slit is now almost monochromatic (red light), except for maybe some other colors that the filter might not completely block. But assuming an ideal red filter, we can consider it as only allowing red light.\n\nIf the light is now red, the interference pattern should resemble that of monochromatic light. For monochromatic light, the central fringe is bright, and the other fringes are equally spaced bright and dark fringes. Since red light has a longer wavelength, the spacing between the fringes would be larger compared to blue light. However, in the original white light case, the central fringe is white. Now, with the red filter, the central fringe would be red, and the other fringes would be spaced out as red fringes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) The interference fringes disappear. That doesn't seem right. If we have monochromatic red light, we should still see interference fringes. So A is probably incorrect.\n\nB) The red fringes in the colored fringes disappear. Hmm. Wait, originally with white light, the fringes are colored. If we add a red filter, then the light is red, so the interference pattern would be red fringes. But the central fringe is red. However, the question says \"the red fringes in the colored fringes disappear.\" Wait, maybe the original pattern with white light has red fringes at the edges of each order. If we filter out non-red light, then the red fringes would still be there. But maybe in the original case, the central fringe is white, and the other fringes are colored. If we use a red filter, the central fringe would be red (since only red is passing), and the other fringes would still be there but maybe the other colors are gone. Wait, but if the light is now red, then the interference pattern is just red fringes. So maybe the central fringe is red, and the other fringes are red as well, but spaced out. So perhaps the original colored fringes (with multiple colors) are replaced by red fringes. So the red fringes in the original pattern (which are part of the colored fringes) would now be more prominent. But the option B says the red fringes in the colored fringes disappear. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when using white light without the red filter, the central fringe is white, and then there are colored fringes around it. When we add the red filter, the light is now red, so the central fringe becomes red. The other fringes would be spaced according to red light's wavelength. But since all the light is red, the other fringes would also be red. So the pattern is just a series of red bright and dark fringes. So the central fringe becomes red (option D). The other options don't seem to fit. Option C says the central fringe becomes a dark fringe, which is incorrect because the central maximum is always bright in interference (constructive interference at the center). So C is wrong. Option D says the central fringe becomes red. Since originally it was white (because all colors are present), adding the red filter would make it red. So D is correct. Therefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
