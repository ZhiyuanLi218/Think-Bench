This is true for all isotopes of potassium, including **potassium-40**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Neutrons in Potassium-40**\nThe **mass number** of potassium-40 is **40**, which is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\n\n$$\n\\text{Neutrons} = \\text{Mass number} - \\text{Protons} = 40 - 19 = 21\n$$\n\nSo, potassium-40 has **21 neutrons**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Electrons in Potassium in K₂SO₄**\nIn the compound **K₂SO₄**, potassium exists as **K⁺ ions** (since sulfate is a -2 ion and two K⁺ ions are needed to balance the charge).\n\n- A **neutral potassium atom** has **19 electrons**, matching the number of protons.\n- As a **K⁺ ion**, potassium has **lost one electron**, so it has:\n\n$$\n\\text{Electrons} = 19 - 1 = 18\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n- **Protons**: 19  \n- **Neutrons**: 21  \n- **Electrons**: 18  \n\nThis matches **Option C**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **C: 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about potassium-40 in K2SO4. I need to find the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons. \n\nFirst, potassium has an atomic number of 19, right? So the number of protons is 19. The isotope is potassium-40, so the mass number is 40. To find the number of neutrons, I subtract the protons from the mass number. So 40 minus 19 gives 21 neutrons. \n\nNow, electrons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the protons, so 19. But wait, K2SO4 is a compound. Potassium in sulfate is usually K+ ions. So potassium in this compound is an ion with a +1 charge. That means it has lost one electron. So electrons would be 19 minus 1, which is 18. \n\nLooking at the options, option C says 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons. That matches what I calculated. Let me double-check. Atomic number 19 for K, mass number 40, so 40-19=21 neutrons. As K+ ion, electrons are 18. Yep, so C is the answer.\n</think>"}
