Let's take them one by one and check the number of atoms on each side. \n\nStarting with option A: Na2SO4 + Ba(NO3)2 → BaSO4 + NaSO4. \n\nFirst, let's break down the compounds. On the left side, we have Na2SO4, which is sodium sulfate. It has 2 Na, 1 S, and 4 O. Then Ba(NO3)2 is barium nitrate. Barium is 1 Ba, nitrate is NO3, so two nitrate groups would be 2 N and 6 O. So total on the left: Na2, S, 4 O (from sulfate) + 1 Ba, 2 N, 6 O (from nitrate). \n\nOn the right side, BaSO4 is barium sulfate. That's 1 Ba, 1 S, 4 O. Then NaSO4 is sodium sulfate? Wait, sodium sulfate is Na2SO4. But here it's written as NaSO4, which would have 1 Na, 1 S, 4 O. So the product has NaSO4 instead of Na2SO4. Let me count the atoms.\n\nLeft side: Na: 2 from Na2SO4, Ba:1, S:1 from sulfate, O: 4 (from sulfate) + 6 (from nitrate) = 10 O. N: 2 from nitrate. \n\nRight side: BaSO4: Ba:1, S:1, O:4. NaSO4: Na:1, S:1, O:4. So total Na on right is 1, but on left it's 2. So sodium is unbalanced. Also, nitrate (N and O) on left is 2 N and 6 O, but on the right, there's no nitrate in the products. Wait, the product is BaSO4 and NaSO4. So nitrate is not present on the right. Therefore, nitrogen is unbalanced. So option A is not balanced.\n\nMoving to option B: AgNO3 + K2CrO4 → Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3.\n\nLet me check each element. Left side: AgNO3 is silver nitrate. So Ag:1, N:1, O:3. K2CrO4 is potassium chromate: K:2, Cr:1, O:4. \n\nRight side: Ag2CrO4: Ag:2, Cr:1, O:4. 2 KNO3: K:2, N:2, O:6 (since each KNO3 has 3 O, times 2 is 6). \n\nNow count each element on both sides.\n\nLeft side: Ag:1, N:1, O:3 + 4 (from K2CrO4) = total O:7? Wait, no. Wait, O from AgNO3 is 3, and from K2CrO4 is 4. Total O on left is 3 + 4 = 7. \n\nRight side: Ag2CrO4 has O:4, and 2 KNO3 has O:6. Total O: 4 + 6 = 10. So O is unbalanced. Let me check other elements.\n\nAg on left is 1, on right is 2. So Ag is unbalanced. K on left is 2, on right is 2 (from 2 KNO3). K is balanced. Cr on left is 1, on right is 1. N on left is 1, on right is 2. So N is unbalanced. \n\nSo the reaction as written is not balanced. Wait, but maybe there's a coefficient missing? The given reaction is written as AgNO3 + K2CrO4 → Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3. Let's check coefficients. If the coefficient for AgNO3 is 2, then:\n\n2 AgNO3 + K2CrO4 → Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3. Let's check that.\n\nLeft side: Ag:2, N:2, O:6 (from 2 AgNO3) + K2CrO4: K:2, Cr:1, O:4. Total O:6 +4=10. \n\nRight side: Ag2CrO4: Ag:2, Cr:1, O:4. 2 KNO3: K:2, N:2, O:6. Total O:4 +6=10. \n\nSo with 2 AgNO3, the reaction would be balanced. But the given reaction in option B is written as AgNO3 (1) + K2CrO4 → Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3. So the coefficient for AgNO3 is missing. Therefore, the reaction as written is not balanced. So option B is not balanced. Wait, but the answer given in option B has 2 KNO3 on the right. Maybe the original reaction is correct with coefficients? Let me check again. \n\nOriginal equation in B: AgNO3 + K2CrO4 → Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3. If we balance Ag, we need 2 AgNO3 on the left. So the correct balanced equation would be 2 AgNO3 + K2CrO4 → Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3. But the given reaction in option B is written without the coefficient 2 in front of AgNO3. Therefore, the given reaction is not balanced. So option B is incorrect.\n\nNow option C: 5 FeCl2 + 8 HCl + KMnO4 → 5 FeCl3 + MnCl2 + 4 H2O + KCl.\n\nThis looks more complex. Let's check each element. \n\nLeft side: 5 FeCl2: Fe:5, Cl:10. 8 HCl: H:8, Cl:8. KMnO4: K:1, Mn:1, O:4. \n\nTotal left: Fe:5, Cl:10 +8 =18, H:8, K:1, Mn:1, O:4.\n\nRight side: 5 FeCl3: Fe:5, Cl:15. MnCl2: Mn:1, Cl:2. 4 H2O: H:8, O:4. KCl: K:1, Cl:1.\n\nTotal right: Fe:5, Cl:15 +2 +1=18, H:8, O:4, K:1, Mn:1.\n\nComparing left and right:\n\nFe:5 on both sides. Cl:18 on both sides. H:8 on both. O:4 on both. K:1. Mn:1. So all elements are balanced. Wait, that seems balanced. Let me check again.\n\nLeft side Cl: 5 FeCl2 has 5*2=10 Cl, 8 HCl has 8 Cl. Total Cl:10+8=18. Right side: 5 FeCl3 has 5*3=15 Cl, MnCl2 has 2 Cl, KCl has 1 Cl. Total Cl:15+2+1=18. Yes. \n\nH: left side 8 H from HCl. Right side 4 H2O gives 4*2=8 H. \n\nO: left side KMnO4 has 4 O. Right side 4 H2O has 4 O. \n\nK:1 on both. Mn:1 on both. Fe:5 on both. \n\nSo all elements are balanced. So option C is balanced. \n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe there's a redox reaction here? Because Fe is going from +2 in FeCl2 to +3 in FeCl3. Mn in KMnO4 is +7, and in MnCl2 it's +2. So oxidation and reduction. Let's check if the electrons are balanced. \n\nFe is oxidized from +2 to +3. Each Fe loses 1 electron. 5 Fe, so total 5 electrons lost.\n\nMn is reduced from +7 in KMnO4 to +2 in MnCl2. So each Mn gains 5 electrons. 1 Mn, so total 5 electrons gained. \n\nSo electrons lost and gained are balanced. Therefore, the reaction is balanced in terms of redox as well. So option C is balanced. \n\nNow option D: Al(NO3)3 + 3 KOH → Al(OH)3 + KNO3.\n\nLet me check each element.\n\nLeft side: Al(NO3)3: Al:1, N:3, O:9 (each NO3 is 3 O, times 3 is 9). 3 KOH: K:3, O:3, H:3.\n\nTotal left: Al:1, N:3, O:9 +3=12, K:3, H:3.\n\nRight side: Al(OH)3: Al:1, O:3, H:3. KNO3: K:1, N:1, O:3.\n\nTotal right: Al:1, O:3 +3=6 (from Al(OH)3 and KNO3), H:3, K:1, N:1.\n\nComparing left and right:\n\nAl: balanced (1 each). K: left has 3, right has 1. Unbalanced. N: left has 3, right has 1. Unbalanced. O: left has 12, right has 6. Unbalanced. H: left has 3, right has 3. H is balanced. \n\nSo clearly, K, N, O are unbalanced. So the reaction is not balanced. The correct balanced equation would require coefficients. For example, if we have 1 Al(NO3)3 + 3 KOH → Al(OH)3 + 3 KNO3. Let's check that.\n\nLeft: Al:1, N:3, O:9 + 3* (O from KOH: each KOH has 1 O, so 3 O total). Total O:9+3=12. K:3, H:3.\n\nRight: Al(OH)3: Al:1, O:3, H:3. 3 KNO3: K:3, N:3, O:9. Total O:3 +9=12. \n\nNow check each element:\n\nAl:1. K:3. N:3. O:12. H:3. All balanced. So the correct balanced equation would have 3 KNO3. But in option D, it's written as KNO3 without a coefficient. So the given reaction in option D is not balanced. \n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n</think>"}
