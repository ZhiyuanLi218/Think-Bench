The engine operates between object 1 (mass m₁, temperature T₁, specific heat c) and the heat reservoir at temperature T₀. There's also object 2 with mass m₂ and temperature T₂, but since the engine is operating between object 1 and the reservoir, maybe object 2 is part of another process? Wait, the problem says the system consists of two objects and a heat reservoir. But the engine operates between object 1 and the heat reservoir. Maybe object 2 is just part of the system but not directly involved in this engine? Or perhaps there's more to it? Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"An ideal Carnot engine R operates within a system consisting of two objects and a heat reservoir. The masses of the two objects are m₁ and m₂, and their temperatures are T₁ and T₂, respectively. Both objects have a specific heat capacity that is a constant c. The temperature of the heat reservoir is T₀. Assume T₁ > T₀ > T₂. The Carnot engine operates between object 1 and the heat reservoir T₀. What are the amounts of heat Q' received by the heat reservoir and the work W₁ done by the engine R on the surroundings?\"\n\nHmm. So the engine is between object 1 and the reservoir. Object 2 is part of the system but maybe not directly involved in this engine. Maybe the problem is considering some interaction where the engine uses object 1 as a hot reservoir and the heat reservoir T₀ as the cold reservoir? But then where does object 2 come into play? Wait, maybe the process continues until object 1 cools down to T₀? Or maybe there's another engine involved with object 2? The problem doesn't mention another engine, though. It just mentions engine R operating between object 1 and the heat reservoir. So perhaps object 2 is irrelevant for this particular question? Or maybe there's more to the problem?\n\nWait, the question is about the heat received by the reservoir and the work done by the engine. Since the engine is operating between object 1 and the reservoir, maybe we need to consider how much heat is extracted from object 1 until it reaches the temperature of the reservoir? Because once object 1 cools down to T₀, the engine can't operate anymore. So maybe the process is until object 1's temperature equals T₀. In that case, we need to calculate the total heat extracted from object 1, the total work done, and the total heat dumped into the reservoir.\n\nBut why is object 2 mentioned? Maybe there's a follow-up question or maybe it's part of a larger problem? The problem as stated is only about engine R operating between object 1 and the reservoir. Maybe object 2 is a distractor here, or perhaps there's an assumption that the heat rejected by the engine goes into object 2? But the problem says the heat reservoir is T₀, so maybe the heat rejected is going into the reservoir? Wait, the question is about the heat received by the heat reservoir, so Q' is the heat dumped into the reservoir by the engine. And W₁ is the work done by the engine.\n\nBut how do we calculate that? For a Carnot engine, the efficiency is 1 - T_cold / T_hot. But since the temperatures of the reservoirs are changing? Wait, no. Wait, the engine is operating between object 1 and the heat reservoir. If the heat reservoir is at a constant temperature T₀, then maybe object 1 is cooling down as it gives heat to the engine. So the temperature of object 1 is changing during the process. However, a Carnot engine requires reservoirs at constant temperatures. So if object 1 is cooling down, how can the engine operate reversibly? Maybe it's operating in infinitesimal cycles, where each cycle occurs at a slightly lower temperature, so that the process is quasi-static?\n\nTherefore, we need to integrate over the temperature change of object 1 from T₁ to T₀. So let me think. The total heat extracted from object 1 when it cools from T₁ to T₀ is Q₁ = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀). But since the engine is Carnot, the work done would be the integral of (1 - T₀ / T) dQ, where T is the temperature of object 1 at each step.\n\nAlternatively, since the Carnot engine's efficiency at any instant is η = 1 - T₀ / T, where T is the temperature of object 1 (the hot reservoir) at that moment. The heat input from object 1 is dQ₁ = -m₁ c dT (since dT is negative as temperature decreases). Then, the work done would be dW = η dQ₁ = (1 - T₀ / T)(-m₁ c dT). Integrating this from T = T₁ to T = T₀.\n\nSimilarly, the heat dumped into the reservoir would be Q' = Q₁ - W, where Q₁ is the total heat extracted from object 1.\n\nAlternatively, since for each infinitesimal step, dQ₁ is the heat extracted from object 1, dW is the work done, and dQ₀ is the heat dumped into the reservoir. For Carnot, dQ₀ = dQ₁ * (T₀ / T). Therefore, Q' = integral from T₁ to T₀ of (T₀ / T) dQ₁. Since dQ₁ = -m₁ c dT, then Q' = integral from T₁ to T₀ of (T₀ / T)(-m₁ c dT) = m₁ c T₀ integral from T₀ to T₁ (1 / T) dT = m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀). Then, the total heat extracted from object 1 is Q₁ = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀). Therefore, the work done is W = Q₁ - Q' = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀) - m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀). But wait, let me check the signs.\n\nWait, when object 1 is cooling down, the heat leaving object 1 is positive for the engine, so Q₁ is positive. The heat dumped into the reservoir is Q', which is positive as well. The work done by the engine is W = Q₁ - Q'.\n\nBut let me do the integrals properly. Let me define:\n\nFor each infinitesimal step, the engine takes in dQ₁ from object 1 (which is cooling), does work dW, and dumps dQ₀ into the reservoir. For a Carnot cycle, we have dQ₁ / T₁ = -dQ₀ / T₀, because the entropy change of the hot reservoir (object 1) is dQ₁ / T, and the entropy change of the cold reservoir (heat reservoir at T₀) is dQ₀ / T₀. Since the process is reversible, total entropy change is zero. Therefore, dQ₁ / T + dQ₀ / T₀ = 0 => dQ₀ = - dQ₁ * T₀ / T. Here, T is the temperature of object 1 at that step.\n\nBut since object 1 is losing heat, dQ₁ is negative. Let me think again. If the object is cooling down, the heat leaving the object is dQ₁ = - m₁ c dT, where dT is positive (since T decreases, dT is negative, so -dT is positive). Wait, maybe I need to be careful with the signs.\n\nLet me consider that when the object cools from T to T - dT, the heat lost by the object is dQ₁ = - m₁ c dT (if dT is negative, meaning T is decreasing). Alternatively, if we let T go from T₁ to T₀, then integrating from T₁ to T₀, dT is negative. But maybe it's easier to write the magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, let me define that the heat extracted from the object is Q₁ = ∫ dQ₁ = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀). Since the object is cooling, the heat transferred out is positive.\n\nThen, for each infinitesimal amount of heat dQ₁ extracted from the object at temperature T, the heat dumped into the reservoir is dQ₀ = dQ₁ * (T₀ / T). Therefore, total Q' = ∫ (T₀ / T) dQ₁. But since Q₁ = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀) = ∫_{T₀}^{T₁} m₁ c dT, but actually, the integral of dQ₁ is from T₁ to T₀. Wait, maybe I need to express dQ₁ in terms of T.\n\nSince the object has a heat capacity m₁ c, then dQ₁ = m₁ c dT, but since the temperature is decreasing, dT is negative. However, if we consider the magnitude, then |dQ₁| = m₁ c |dT|. But for integration purposes, let's express Q' as:\n\nQ' = ∫_{T₁}^{T₀} (T₀ / T) dQ₁. But since dQ₁ = m₁ c dT, and when T goes from T₁ to T₀, dT is negative. Therefore:\n\nQ' = ∫_{T₁}^{T₀} (T₀ / T) * m₁ c dT = m₁ c T₀ ∫_{T₁}^{T₀} (1 / T) dT = m₁ c T₀ [ln T]_{T₁}^{T₀} = m₁ c T₀ (ln T₀ - ln T₁) = - m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀). But since Q' is the heat received by the reservoir, it should be positive. Therefore, taking absolute value? Or maybe I have a sign error.\n\nWait, if we consider that when the object cools down, it is losing heat, so dQ₁ is negative. Therefore, if we write:\n\ndQ₀ = - (T₀ / T) dQ₁. Wait, from the second law, for the Carnot cycle, the heat dumped into the cold reservoir is dQ₀ = dQ₁ * (T₀ / T). But since dQ₁ is negative (heat leaving the hot reservoir), then dQ₀ is negative? No, the heat dumped into the cold reservoir should be positive. Maybe I need to think in terms of absolute values.\n\nLet me recall that for a Carnot engine, the relation between heat absorbed from the hot reservoir Q₁, heat rejected to the cold reservoir Q₀, and work done W is:\n\nQ₁ / T₁ = Q₀ / T₀ (for entropy), but actually, it's Q₁ / T₁ = Q₀ / T₀ in magnitude? Wait, no, the actual relation is Q₁ / T₁ = - Q₀ / T₀ because the heat leaving the hot reservoir is positive Q₁, and the heat entering the cold reservoir is positive Q₀. Therefore:\n\nQ₁ / T₁ = Q₀ / T₀ => Q₀ = Q₁ * T₀ / T₁ for the case of constant temperatures. However, in our case, T₁ is changing, so for each infinitesimal step, we have dQ₁ / T = dQ₀ / T₀ => dQ₀ = dQ₁ * T₀ / T.\n\nBut since the object is the hot reservoir, which is losing heat, dQ₁ is negative. Therefore, dQ₀ is negative? That can't be. Wait, if the engine takes heat dQ₁ from the hot reservoir (object 1), which is negative because the object is losing heat, then dQ₀, the heat dumped into the cold reservoir, should be positive. Let me think about the signs again.\n\nLet me define all heats as positive when they enter the engine. So the engine receives heat |dQ₁| from the hot reservoir (object 1) and dumps heat |dQ₀| into the cold reservoir (T₀). Then, the first law says |dQ₁| - |dQ₀| = dW. And the second law for Carnot says |dQ₁| / T₁ = |dQ₀| / T₀. Therefore, |dQ₀| = |dQ₁| * T₀ / T₁. But in our case, T₁ is changing, so T₁ is actually T, the temperature of the object at that moment. Therefore, |dQ₀| = |dQ₁| * T₀ / T.\n\nBut |dQ₁| is equal to the heat lost by the object, which is m₁ c dT', where dT' is the magnitude of the temperature change. Wait, if the object is cooling by dT, then |dQ₁| = m₁ c dT, where dT is positive. But integrating from T₁ to T₀, the total |Q₁| = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀). Therefore, Q' = ∫ |dQ₀| = ∫ (T₀ / T) |dQ₁| = T₀ ∫ (1 / T) m₁ c dT from T = T₁ to T = T₀. Which is m₁ c T₀ ∫_{T₁}^{T₀} (1 / T) dT = m₁ c T₀ [ln T]_{T₁}^{T₀} = m₁ c T₀ (ln T₀ - ln T₁) = - m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀). But since Q' is the heat received by the reservoir, it's positive, so maybe I should write it as m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀). Because ln(T₀ / T₁) is negative, so multiplying by -1 gives positive. Therefore, Q' = m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀).\n\nThen, the total work done is W = |Q₁| - Q' = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀) - m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀).\n\nTherefore, the answers should be Q' = m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀) and W₁ = m₁ c [T₁ - T₀ - T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀)].\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense. For example, if T₀ approaches T₁, then ln(T₁ / T₀) approaches 0, so Q' approaches 0, and W approaches m₁ c (T₁ - T₀), which makes sense because if the reservoir is almost at the same temperature as object 1, the engine can't do much work, but actually, if T₀ approaches T₁, the work should approach zero as well? Wait, no. Wait, if T₀ approaches T₁, the efficiency approaches zero, so even though the heat extracted Q₁ approaches m₁ c (T₁ - T₀) which approaches zero as well. So the product might be finite? Wait, let's take T₀ = T₁ - ε, with ε small. Then Q₁ ≈ m₁ c ε, and the efficiency is approximately 1 - (T₁ - ε)/T₁ ≈ ε / T₁. Then work W ≈ Q₁ * ε / T₁ ≈ m₁ c ε² / T₁, which goes to zero as ε goes to zero. Meanwhile, our expression for W is m₁ c [ε - (T₁ - ε) ln(T₁ / (T₁ - ε))]. Let's approximate ln(T₁ / (T₁ - ε)) ≈ ln(1 + ε / (T₁ - ε)) ≈ ε / T₁. Therefore, the second term is approximately (T₁ - ε) * ε / T₁ ≈ ε. Therefore, W ≈ m₁ c [ε - ε] = 0. So that checks out. So maybe the expression is okay.\n\nAnother check: suppose T₀ is 0 K (which is not physical, but for the sake of check). Then ln(T₁ / 0) is undefined, but approaching zero, ln(T₁ / T₀) approaches infinity, but Q' would be infinite? But if T₀ approaches 0, then the heat dumped into the reservoir Q' would be m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀). As T₀ approaches zero, T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀) approaches zero because T₀ dominates. For example, let T₀ approach zero, then ln(T₁ / T₀) ~ - ln T₀, but T₀ (- ln T₀) approaches zero. Therefore, Q' approaches zero. Which makes sense, because if the cold reservoir is at 0 K, then the efficiency is 1 - 0 / T = 1, so all heat from object 1 is converted to work, so W = Q₁, and Q' = 0. Which matches the limit. So our expression for Q' approaches zero, and W approaches Q₁. Therefore, our expressions seem to hold in these limits.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is:\n\nQ' = m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀)\n\nand\n\nW₁ = m₁ c [T₁ - T₀ - T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀)]\n\nBut let me check units. The specific heat c has units of J/(kg·K). Multiplying by mass m₁ (kg) gives J/K. Then multiplied by T (K), gives Joules. So yes, units are correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there is another approach. The total change in entropy of object 1 is ΔS₁ = m₁ c ln(T₀ / T₁). The total change in entropy of the heat reservoir is ΔS₀ = Q' / T₀. Since the engine is Carnot, the total entropy change of the universe should be zero. Therefore:\n\nΔS₁ + ΔS₀ = 0 => m₁ c ln(T₀ / T₁) + Q' / T₀ = 0 => Q' = - m₁ c T₀ ln(T₀ / T₁) = m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀). Which matches our previous result. Great! Therefore, this confirms Q'.\n\nThen, since the work done is W = Q₁ - Q', where Q₁ is the heat extracted from object 1. The heat extracted from object 1 is Q₁ = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀). Therefore, W = m₁ c (T₁ - T₀) - m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀). Which is what we had before.\n\nTherefore, the answers should be:\n\nQ' = m₁ c T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀)\n\nand\n\nW₁ = m₁ c [T₁ - T₀ - T₀ ln(T₁ / T₀)]\n\nBut the problem mentions two objects and a heat reservoir. Why is object 2 mentioned? The problem says \"the system consisting of two objects and a heat reservoir\". Maybe there is a follow-up where we also consider object 2, but the question is only about engine R operating between object 1 and the reservoir. Therefore, object 2 is just part of the overall system but not involved in this particular engine operation. Therefore, our answer doesn't involve m₂ or T₂. So maybe the presence of object 2 is just to set up a more complex problem, but for this specific question, it's irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, I think these are the correct expressions for Q' and W₁.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe amount of heat received by the heat reservoir is $\\boxed{m_1 c T_0 \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{T_1}{T_0}\\right)}$ and the work done by the engine is $\\boxed{m_1 c \\left[T_1 - T_0 - T_0 \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{T_1}{T_0}\\right)\\right]}$.\n</think>"}
