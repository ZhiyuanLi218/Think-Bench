Let me start by recalling what I know about gas laws. The problem says the pressure is constant, so that probably means Charles's Law applies here. Charles's Law relates volume and temperature at constant pressure, right? The formula is V1/T1 = V2/T2, where V is volume and T is temperature. But wait, temperature has to be in Kelvin for these gas laws, right? So I need to convert the given temperatures to Kelvin first.\n\nThe initial volume is 5.00 L, and the initial temperature is 127°C. Let me convert that to Kelvin by adding 273.15. So 127 + 273.15 equals... let me calculate that. 127 + 273 is 400, so approximately 400.15 K. But maybe for simplicity, since 127°C is a whole number, they might expect me to use 400 K? Hmm, but let me check: 127°C + 273.15 = 400.15 K. Maybe I should use 400.15 K for accuracy. Although sometimes in these problems, they approximate 273 as 273.15, so maybe 400.15 is okay.\n\nThe initial pressure is 875 mm Hg, but since the pressure is constant, I don't think I need to use the pressure value in my calculations for Charles's Law. The problem says the sample was heated at constant pressure until the volume became 10.00 L. So the final volume V2 is 10.00 L. I need to find the final temperature T2.\n\nSo rearranging Charles's Law formula, T2 = (V2 * T1) / V1. Plugging in the numbers: T2 = (10.00 L * 400.15 K) / 5.00 L. Let me compute that. The liters cancel out, so 10 divided by 5 is 2, so 2 * 400.15 K is 800.3 K. So the final temperature in Kelvin is approximately 800.3 K.\n\nBut the question asks for the final temperature in degrees Celsius. To convert back to Celsius, I subtract 273.15. So 800.3 K - 273.15 = 527.15°C. Let me check that subtraction again. 800.3 minus 273.15. Let's do 800 - 273 = 527, and then 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.15. So total is 527.15°C. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option B is 527°C. That seems to match. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. \n\nWait, let me double-check the initial temperature conversion. 127°C to Kelvin: 127 + 273.15 = 400.15 K. Correct. Then using Charles's Law: V1/T1 = V2/T2. Since pressure is constant, yes. So solving for T2: T2 = T1*(V2/V1). Which is 400.15 K * (10.00 / 5.00) = 400.15 * 2 = 800.3 K. Converting back: 800.3 - 273.15 = 527.15°C. So rounding to the nearest whole number, it's 527°C. Which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check if the question expects a different approach. For example, sometimes people use 273 instead of 273.15 for conversion. Let me see. If I use 273, then initial temperature is 127 + 273 = 400 K. Final temperature in Kelvin is 800 K. Then converting back to Celsius: 800 - 273 = 527°C. Same result. So either way, it rounds to 527°C. So answer B is correct. \n\nI don't think any of the other options make sense. Let me check the options again: A is 454°C. If someone forgot to convert to Kelvin and just did a proportion with Celsius, they might have done (5.00 / 10.00) = (127 / T2), but that's wrong because Charles's Law requires absolute temperature. Let me see what that would give. If someone incorrectly used Celsius, they might set up V1/V2 = T1/T2, but that's not correct. Wait, actually Charles's Law is V1/T1 = V2/T2. So if they messed up the formula, they might get a different answer. But since we did the right steps, converting to Kelvin, it's 527°C. \n\nAnother possible mistake could be if someone thought the temperature doubles when volume doubles, so 127°C times 2 is 254°C, but that's not right because you have to use Kelvin. For example, doubling the Kelvin temperature would be 400 K * 2 = 800 K, which is 527°C, which is correct. If you just double Celsius, you get an incorrect answer. So answer B is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: 527°C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
