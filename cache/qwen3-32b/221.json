Let me start by recalling what I know about spin states and measurements.\n\nFirst, the spin-1/2 system. The eigenstates of S_z are usually denoted as |+> and |->, corresponding to spin up and down along the z-axis. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle, right? Because S_z can be +1/2 or -1/2 in units of ħ. Wait, but the problem mentions S_z is +1. Hmm. Maybe they are using units where ħ=1? Or maybe it's a spin-1 particle? Wait, the question says \"the eigenstate where S_z is +1\". For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues are ±1/2. So maybe this is a spin-1 system? But usually, when people talk about spin measurements without specifying, they often refer to spin-1/2. Maybe the question is in units where ħ=1? Let me check.\n\nIf it's spin-1/2, then the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. If ħ is set to 1, then they would be ±1/2. But the question says S_z is +1. So perhaps this is a spin-1 particle? Spin-1 particles have eigenvalues -1, 0, +1. But the question is about measuring spin along a direction, so maybe it's still spin-1/2? Maybe they just scaled the units? Hmm. Maybe I need to assume spin-1/2 with ħ=1? Or maybe the question is using a different notation. Wait, the problem says \"the eigenstate where S_z is +1\". If it's spin-1/2, then that would be impossible. So maybe it's spin-1? Let me check the context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about spin-1/2 and the +1 is a typo or shorthand for +1/2. But I can't assume that. Let me try to think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction -n(θ, φ) is a direction in space, and the question is about measuring the spin along that direction. So regardless of the system, if we have a spin state that is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 (assuming spin-1/2), then we want to find the probability that measuring the spin along the direction -n(θ, φ) gives a particular value. Wait, but the question says \"the probability of measuring the spin along the direction -n(θ, φ)\". So maybe they mean the probability of getting +ħ/2 along that direction? Or maybe the probability of getting -ħ/2?\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"the probability of measuring the spin along the direction -n(θ, φ)\". Typically, when you measure spin along a direction, you get either + or -, so maybe they want the probability of getting + along that direction? Or maybe the probability of getting - along that direction?\n\nBut the problem is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the original state is the eigenstate where S_z is +1. So if the system is in the state |+z>, what is the probability that a measurement along the direction -n(θ, φ) yields a particular result?\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"the probability of measuring the spin along the direction -n(θ, φ)\". Maybe they mean the probability of measuring spin-up along that direction? Or maybe spin-down? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the probability of measuring the spin in the direction opposite to n(θ, φ). So if n(θ, φ) is a direction in space, then -n(θ, φ) is the opposite direction. So measuring the spin along -n(θ, φ) would be equivalent to measuring the spin in the direction opposite to n(θ, φ). So if the original state is |+z>, then the probability of measuring spin-up along -n(θ, φ) would be...?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the probability of measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ)? Because measuring along -n(θ, φ) could be equivalent to measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ). But I need to be precise.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's suppose we have a spin-1/2 particle in the state |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's set ħ=1 for simplicity. Now, we want to measure the spin along the direction -n(θ, φ). The direction n(θ, φ) is given in spherical coordinates, so θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle. The direction -n(θ, φ) would be the antipodal point on the sphere, which is equivalent to adding π to both angles? Wait, no. If n(θ, φ) is a direction, then -n(θ, φ) would be the direction opposite to n(θ, φ). So if n is (θ, φ), then -n is (π - θ, φ + π)? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Suppose we have a unit vector n(θ, φ) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Then -n(θ, φ) would be (-sinθ cosφ, -sinθ sinφ, -cosθ). Which is equivalent to a vector pointing in the direction with polar angle π - θ and azimuthal angle φ + π? Let me check.\n\nIf θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, then π - θ would be the polar angle from the -z-axis. So if you have a direction n(θ, φ), then -n(θ, φ) is equivalent to a direction with polar angle π - θ and azimuthal angle φ + π. So yes, the direction -n(θ, φ) can be represented as (π - θ, φ + π). Alternatively, since azimuthal angle is defined modulo 2π, φ + π is equivalent to φ - π. So maybe it's easier to think of it as a direction with angles (π - θ, φ + π).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this. The key is that we need to find the probability that a spin-1/2 particle in the |+z> state will be measured to have spin-up along the direction -n(θ, φ). Alternatively, the probability of measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ). Because measuring spin along -n(θ, φ) is equivalent to measuring spin in the opposite direction. So maybe there's a relation between the two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the general formula for the probability of measuring a spin in a particular direction. For a spin-1/2 particle in state |ψ>, the probability of measuring spin-up along direction n(θ, φ) is |<n(θ, φ)|ψ>|². So if our state is |+z>, then the probability of measuring spin-up along direction n(θ, φ) is |<n(θ, φ)|+z>|².\n\nBut here, we want the probability of measuring spin-up along direction -n(θ, φ). So we need to compute |<-n(θ, φ)|+z>|². Alternatively, maybe we can find the relation between <-n|+z> and <n|+z>.\n\nAlternatively, since -n(θ, φ) is equivalent to the direction n'(θ', φ') where θ' = π - θ and φ' = φ + π, then we can compute the inner product <n'(θ', φ')|+z>.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's recall that the spin eigenstates along a direction n(θ, φ) can be written as:\n\n|n(θ, φ)> = e^{-iφ S_z} e^{-iθ S_y} |+z>\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, the spin-up state along direction n(θ, φ) is:\n\n|n(θ, φ)+> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |->z>\n\nWait, no. Let me recall the standard expression. The spin-up state along direction n(θ, φ) is:\n\n|n(θ, φ)+> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |->z>\n\nWait, actually, I think it's:\n\n|n(θ, φ)+> = e^{-iφ S_z} e^{-iθ S_y} |+z>\n\nWhich, when expanded, gives:\n\n|n(θ, φ)+> = cos(θ/2) |+z> - e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |->z>\n\nWait, there's a sign difference depending on the convention. Let me check.\n\nThe standard spinor for a spin-up state along direction n(θ, φ) is:\n\n|n+> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |->z>\n\nWait, but depending on the rotation operators. Let me recall. If you rotate the z-axis to the direction n(θ, φ), you can do it by first rotating around the y-axis by θ, then around the z-axis by φ. The rotation operator is e^{-iφ J_z} e^{-iθ J_y}. For spin-1/2, J is replaced by S.\n\nSo applying this to |+z>, we get:\n\n|n+> = e^{-iφ S_z} e^{-iθ S_y} |+z>\n\nLet me compute this. Let me recall that e^{-iθ S_y} |+z> can be calculated. The operator e^{-iθ S_y} is a rotation around y by θ. The eigenstates of S_y are different, but here we are rotating |+z>.\n\nThe rotation operator around y by angle θ is:\n\ne^{-iθ S_y} = cos(θ/2) I - i sin(θ/2) (2 S_y)\n\nFor spin-1/2, S_y = ħ/2 σ_y. Let's set ħ=1, so S_y = σ_y / 2. Then:\n\ne^{-iθ S_y} = e^{-iθ σ_y / 2} = cos(θ/2) I - i sin(θ/2) σ_y\n\nSo applying this to |+z>:\n\ne^{-iθ S_y} |+z> = cos(θ/2) |+z> - i sin(θ/2) σ_y |+z>\n\nNow, σ_y |+z> = i |->z>, because σ_y |↑> = i |↓>, if |↑> is |+z> and |↓> is |->z>.\n\nSo:\n\ne^{-iθ S_y} |+z> = cos(θ/2) |+z> - i sin(θ/2) (i |->z>) = cos(θ/2) |+z> - i^2 sin(θ/2) |->z> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |->z>\n\nThen we apply e^{-iφ S_z} to this result. Since S_z |+z> = +1/2 |+z> and S_z |->z> = -1/2 |->z> (assuming ħ=1), then:\n\ne^{-iφ S_z} |+z> = e^{-iφ (1/2)} |+z> = e^{-iφ/2} |+z>\n\nSimilarly,\n\ne^{-iφ S_z} |->z> = e^{-iφ (-1/2)} |->z> = e^{+iφ/2} |->z>\n\nTherefore,\n\ne^{-iφ S_z} [cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |->z>] = cos(θ/2) e^{-iφ/2} |+z> + sin(θ/2) e^{+iφ/2} |->z>\n\nTherefore, the spin-up state along direction n(θ, φ) is:\n\n|n(θ, φ)+> = cos(θ/2) e^{-iφ/2} |+z> + sin(θ/2) e^{+iφ/2} |->z>\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\n|n(θ, φ)+> = e^{-iφ/2} [cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |->z>]\n\nBut since the global phase doesn't matter, we can write:\n\n|n(θ, φ)+> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |->z>\n\nWhich is a common expression. So that's the spin-up state along direction n(θ, φ).\n\nNow, the spin-down state along n(θ, φ) is orthogonal to this, and can be written as:\n\n|n(θ, φ)-> = -sin(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) |->z>\n\nBut maybe I don't need that.\n\nNow, our problem is to find the probability that the state |+z> (which is the eigenstate with S_z = +1/2, assuming ħ=1) yields a measurement along direction -n(θ, φ). Let's clarify what that means.\n\nIf we want to measure spin along direction -n(θ, φ), which is the opposite direction, then the spin-up state along -n(θ, φ) would be the same as the spin-down state along n(θ, φ). Because if you reverse the direction, the spin-up becomes spin-down.\n\nAlternatively, the spin-up state along -n(θ, φ) is the same as the spin-down state along n(θ, φ). Therefore, the probability of measuring spin-up along -n(θ, φ) is the same as the probability of measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ).\n\nBut since our initial state is |+z>, the probability of measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ) is |<n(θ, φ)-|+z>|². Alternatively, since the spin-down state along n(θ, φ) is orthogonal to the spin-up state along n(θ, φ), and the inner product of |+z> with |n(θ, φ)-> would be?\n\nAlternatively, since we have expressions for |n(θ, φ)+> and |n(θ, φ)->, we can compute the inner product <n(θ, φ)+|+z> and <n(θ, φ)-|+z>.\n\nBut our problem is about the direction -n(θ, φ). Let me denote m = -n(θ, φ). Then, the spin-up state along m is |m+> which is the same as |n->. Therefore, the probability we need is |<m+|+z>|² = |<n-|+z>|².\n\nAlternatively, since |n-> is orthogonal to |n+>, and we can write |n-> as:\n\n|n(θ, φ)-> = -sin(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) |->z>\n\nTherefore, <n-|+z> is the inner product of the bra <n-| with |+z>, which is the coefficient of |+z> in |n-> multiplied by its conjugate.\n\nLooking at |n(θ, φ)-> = -sin(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) |->z>, so the coefficient of |+z> is -sin(θ/2). Therefore, <n-|+z> is the conjugate of -sin(θ/2), which is -sin(θ/2) since it's real. Therefore, |<n-|+z>|² = sin²(θ/2).\n\nWait, but that would be the probability of measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ) when the state is |+z>, which is sin²(θ/2). Therefore, since measuring spin-up along -n(θ, φ) is the same as measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ), the probability is sin²(θ/2). Is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, let's verify this with another approach. Let's compute the inner product between |+z> and the spin-up state along -n(θ, φ).\n\nLet me denote m = -n(θ, φ). The direction m can be parametrized as (π - θ, φ + π), as discussed earlier. Let me compute |m+> using the formula:\n\n|m+> = cos(θ'/2) |+z> + e^{iφ'} sin(θ'/2) |->z>\n\nWhere θ' = π - θ and φ' = φ + π.\n\nSo θ'/2 = (π - θ)/2 = π/2 - θ/2.\n\ncos(θ'/2) = cos(π/2 - θ/2) = sin(θ/2).\n\nSimilarly, sin(θ'/2) = sin(π/2 - θ/2) = cos(θ/2).\n\nAnd φ' = φ + π, so e^{iφ'} = e^{i(φ + π)} = -e^{iφ}.\n\nTherefore, substituting into |m+>:\n\n|m+> = sin(θ/2) |+z> + (-e^{iφ}) cos(θ/2) |->z> = sin(θ/2) |+z> - e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) |->z>\n\nTherefore, the inner product <m+|+z> is the coefficient of |+z> in |m+>, which is sin(θ/2). Therefore, |<m+|+z>|² = sin²(θ/2). Which matches the previous result. Therefore, the probability is sin²(θ/2). So the answer is sin²(θ/2).\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let's use the general formula for transition probability between two spin states. The inner product between |+z> and |n(θ, φ)+> is cos(θ/2), as per the expression:\n\n|n+> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |->z>\n\nTherefore, <n+|+z> = cos(θ/2). Therefore, the probability of measuring spin-up along n(θ, φ) when in state |+z> is cos²(θ/2). Therefore, the probability of measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ) is 1 - cos²(θ/2) = sin²(θ/2), which matches. Therefore, since measuring spin-up along -n(θ, φ) is equivalent to measuring spin-down along n(θ, φ), the probability is sin²(θ/2). Therefore, the answer is sin²(θ/2).\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a dependence on φ. Wait, in the calculation above, when we computed |m+>, we had a term with -e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) |->z>, but the inner product <m+|+z> only depends on the coefficient of |+z>, which is sin(θ/2), so the inner product is sin(θ/2), regardless of φ. Therefore, the probability is sin²(θ/2), independent of φ. That seems counterintuitive? Wait, if we measure along a direction that is in the x-z plane, say, then φ=0, but if it's in another direction with different φ, does the probability depend on φ?\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose θ is fixed, say θ = π/2, so n(θ, φ) is along the x-direction (if φ=0). Then -n(θ, φ) would be along -x. The probability of measuring |+z> to be spin-up along -x. Let's compute it. If θ=π/2, then sin²(θ/2) = sin²(π/4) = 1/2. Which makes sense, because the probability of measuring spin-up along -x for a |+z> state is 1/2. Similarly, if θ=0, then n(θ, φ) is along z, so -n is -z. Then sin²(θ/2) = sin²(0) = 0. Which makes sense, because if you're in |+z>, measuring along -z will give spin-up with probability zero (since spin-up along -z is spin-down along z). Wait, no: spin-up along -z is spin-down along z. So if you're in |+z>, the probability of measuring spin-up along -z is zero. Which matches sin²(0) = 0. Similarly, if θ=π, then n(θ, φ) is along -z, and -n is +z. Then sin²(π/2) = 1. Which makes sense, because measuring spin-up along +z (which is -n in this case) when the state is |+z> is 1. So that works. So the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut what about φ? Let me take θ=π/2, φ arbitrary. Then the direction n(θ, φ) is on the equator, direction φ. Then -n(θ, φ) is the opposite direction on the equator, direction φ + π. The probability is sin²(θ/2) = 1/2 regardless of φ. Which is correct, because for any direction on the equator, the probability of measuring |+z> to be spin-up along that direction is 1/2. Similarly, spin-up along the opposite direction on the equator is also 1/2. Therefore, the result is independent of φ, which is correct. Therefore, the probability is indeed sin²(θ/2).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be sin²(θ/2). However, let me check again with another method.\n\nAnother approach: the probability of measuring spin along direction -n(θ, φ) is given by the expectation value of the projection operator onto that direction. Wait, no. The probability is given by the square of the amplitude. Alternatively, using the Bloch sphere, the state |+z> corresponds to the north pole. The direction -n(θ, φ) is the antipodal point of n(θ, φ). The probability of measuring the state to be in the direction -n(θ, φ) can be calculated as the overlap squared.\n\nBut on the Bloch sphere, the inner product between two states |a> and |b> is given by <a|b> = cos(Δ/2), where Δ is the angle between them on the Bloch sphere. Therefore, if our state is |+z> (north pole) and the direction we're measuring is -n(θ, φ), which is the antipodal point of n(θ, φ). The angle between |+z> and -n(θ, φ) is π - θ. Because n(θ, φ) makes an angle θ with the z-axis, so -n(θ, φ) makes an angle π - θ with the z-axis. Therefore, the angle between |+z> and -n(θ, φ) is π - θ. Therefore, the inner product is cos( (π - θ)/2 ) = cos(π/2 - θ/2) = sin(θ/2). Therefore, the probability is |<a|b>|² = sin²(θ/2). Which matches our previous result. Therefore, this confirms the answer is sin²(θ/2).\n\nTherefore, the probability is sin²(θ/2).\n\nBut let me check once more with matrix mechanics. Let me take specific angles. Let me take θ = π/2, φ arbitrary. Then the direction -n(θ, φ) is along -x (if φ=0). The spin-up state along -x is |->x = (|+z> - |->z>)/√2. The inner product of |+z> with |->x is <+z|->x> = 1/√2. Therefore, the probability is |1/√2|² = 1/2. Which is sin²(π/4) = 1/2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: θ = π/3, so θ/2 = π/6. Then sin²(θ/2) = sin²(π/6) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Let's compute the inner product. The direction -n(π/3, φ) is (π - π/3, φ + π) = (2π/3, φ + π). The spin-up state along this direction is |m+> = sin(π/6) |+z> - e^{iφ} cos(π/6) |->z> = 1/2 |+z> - e^{iφ} (√3/2) |->z>. Therefore, the inner product with |+z> is 1/2, so the probability is 1/4. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is sin²(θ/2). Therefore, the probability is sin squared theta over two.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions S_z is +1. If we are in a spin-1 system, the calculation might be different. Wait, let me think again. The problem says \"in the eigenstate where S_z is +1\". For a spin-1/2 system, S_z can be ±1/2. So if the question is using units where ħ=1, then S_z is ±1/2. But the question says \"+1\". Therefore, maybe it's a spin-1 system? Let me check.\n\nIn a spin-1 system, the eigenstates of S_z are |+1>, |0>, and |−1>. If the system is in |+1>, and we want to measure the spin along direction -n(θ, φ). The probability calculation would be different for spin-1. However, the problem didn't specify the spin, but usually when people talk about spin measurements without specifying, it's spin-1/2. Also, the question says \"the eigenstate where S_z is +1\". If it's spin-1, then that's possible. But the formula for the probability might be different. Let me check.\n\nFor spin-1, the inner product between |+z> and the state |n+> (spin +1 along direction n(θ, φ)) is different. The general formula for spin-1 is more complicated. However, the question might still be about spin-1/2, with a typo or using units where ħ=2? Or maybe the question is in natural units where ħ=1 and spin is 1/2, but the eigenvalues are ±1/2. But the question says \"+1\". Maybe it's a typo, or maybe they mean +1/2. Alternatively, maybe the question is about spin-1 and wants the probability of measuring +1 along -n(θ, φ).\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify, and given that the standard spin measurements are usually for spin-1/2, and the answer sin²(θ/2) is standard for spin-1/2, I think the question is about spin-1/2, and the \"+1\" is probably a typo or shorthand for +1/2. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different notation where S_z is +1 for spin-1/2. However, in standard notation, it's ±1/2. Given that, I think the answer is sin²(θ/2), assuming spin-1/2.\n\nAlternatively, if it's spin-1, the calculation would be different. For spin-1, the state |+z> (with S_z=+1) and measuring along direction -n(θ, φ). The probability would require more work. Let me try to think about that briefly.\n\nFor spin-1, the eigenstates along direction n(θ, φ) can be constructed, but the inner product between |+z> and |n+> is more complex. However, given that the problem didn't specify spin-1, and given that the answer for spin-1/2 is sin²(θ/2), and that's a standard result, I think the question is about spin-1/2. Therefore, the answer is sin²(θ/2).\n\nTherefore, after all these considerations and checks, I conclude that the probability is sin²(θ/2).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}.\n</think>"}
