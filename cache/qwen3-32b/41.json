Let me try to figure it out. The question is asking how far the box slides before coming to rest, given its mass m, initial speed v0, and the coefficient of kinetic friction μ. The options are A through D, each with different expressions. Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about friction and motion.\n\nFirst, the box is sliding on a horizontal surface. The forces acting on it are gravity and the normal force from the surface, right? But since it's moving, there's also kinetic friction opposing the motion. The problem says there are no other forces, so we don't have to worry about anything else like air resistance or applied forces after the initial push.\n\nSo, the key here is probably to use the concept of work done by friction to stop the box. The initial kinetic energy of the box will be dissipated by the work done against friction until the box comes to rest. That sounds like an energy approach. Alternatively, I could use kinematics equations with the acceleration caused by friction. Let me try both methods to see if I get the same answer.\n\nStarting with energy. The initial kinetic energy of the box is (1/2)mv0². The work done by friction should equal this kinetic energy because that's how much energy needs to be dissipated to bring the box to rest. The work done by friction is force of friction multiplied by the distance slid. The force of friction is μ times the normal force. Since the box is on a horizontal surface, the normal force equals the weight, which is mg. Therefore, the frictional force is μmg. \n\nSo, work done by friction is force times distance, so W = μmg * d. Setting this equal to the initial kinetic energy:\n\n(1/2)mv0² = μmg * d\n\nThen solving for d:\n\nd = (1/2)mv0² / (μmg) \n\nThe mass m cancels out:\n\nd = v0² / (2μg)\n\nSo that's option A. Hmm. Let me check if that makes sense. If the coefficient of friction is higher, the distance should be less, which it is because μ is in the denominator. If initial speed is higher, distance increases with the square of speed, which also makes sense. Gravity is in the denominator, so on a planet with higher gravity, the box stops quicker, which seems right. Okay, that seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, let me try the kinematics approach. The acceleration (deceleration) caused by friction is a = -F_friction / m. The friction force is μmg, so acceleration is -μmg / m = -μg. So the acceleration is -μg. \n\nNow, using the kinematic equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and distance. The equation is:\n\nv² = v0² + 2a d\n\nHere, final velocity v is 0, so:\n\n0 = v0² + 2*(-μg)*d\n\nSolving for d:\n\n0 = v0² - 2μg d  \n=> 2μg d = v0²  \n=> d = v0² / (2μg)\n\nSame result as before. So that's option A again. So both methods lead to the same answer, which is good. Let me check the options again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in algebra.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA: v0²/(2μg)  \nB: v0²/(μg)  \nC: 2v0²/(μg)  \nD: mv0²/(μg)\n\nYes, so A is the one we got. Let me think if there's any possibility I messed up the signs or something. The acceleration is negative because it's opposing the motion, so in the kinematic equation, the acceleration is subtracted. The calculation seems right. The mass cancels out in both approaches, which is why options B, C, and D have different factors. For example, option D has mass in the numerator, but since mass cancels, it shouldn't be there. So D is incorrect. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if you double the mass, the distance should remain the same because although friction increases with mass, so does the inertia. Hence, mass doesn't affect the distance, which is why it cancels out. Therefore, any answer with mass in it (option D) is wrong. Similarly, checking units. Let's check the units for option A. v0² is (m²/s²). μ is dimensionless, g is m/s². So denominator is (1)*(m/s²) => overall units are (m²/s²) / (m/s²) )= meters. Which is correct for distance. For option B, same units, but denominator is μg, so same units, but the answer is half of B. So units are okay for all options except D, which has mass*velocity squared over (μg). Mass is kg, velocity squared is m²/s², so kg*m²/(s²). Divided by μg (which is m/s²). So overall units would be kg*m²/(s²) * 1/(m/s²) )= kg*m. Which is kg*m, which is not meters. So option D has incorrect units. Therefore, D is wrong. So that's another check. So A is correct.\n\nSo, after multiple checks, I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
