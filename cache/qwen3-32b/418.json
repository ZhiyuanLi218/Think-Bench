The operation is a & b equals the square root of (ab + a) divided by the square root of (ab - b). Let me write that down to make sure I have it right:\n\na & b = √(ab + a) / √(ab - b)\n\nAlright, so for 9 & 2, I just substitute a = 9 and b = 2 into that formula. Let me do that step by step. First, let me compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the numerator: √(ab + a). Let's compute ab first. a is 9 and b is 2, so 9*2 is 18. Then add a, which is 9, so 18 + 9 = 27. Therefore, the numerator is √27.\n\nNow the denominator: √(ab - b). Again, ab is 18, and then subtract b, which is 2. So 18 - 2 = 16. Therefore, the denominator is √16.\n\nSo putting it all together, 9 & 2 is √27 divided by √16. Let me compute those square roots. √16 is straightforward, that's 4. √27... Hmm, 27 is 9*3, so √27 is √(9*3) which is √9 * √3 = 3√3. Therefore, the numerator simplifies to 3√3 and the denominator is 4. Therefore, 9 & 2 is (3√3)/4.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me go through the steps again. First, ab is 9*2=18. Then ab + a is 18 + 9=27, correct. ab - b is 18 - 2=16, correct. Square roots: √27 is 3√3 and √16 is 4. So yes, dividing them gives 3√3 / 4. That seems right.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to simplify the original expression before plugging in numbers. Maybe there's a way to factor or manipulate the expression algebraically? Let me see:\n\nOriginal formula: √(ab + a)/√(ab - b). Let's factor numerator and denominator inside the square roots. In the numerator, ab + a can be factored as a(b + 1). In the denominator, ab - b can be factored as b(a - 1). So then:\n\n√[a(b + 1)] / √[b(a - 1)] = √[a(b + 1)/b(a - 1)]\n\nBut maybe that's not necessarily simpler. Let's see if plugging in a=9 and b=2 gives the same result. So:\n\nNumerator inside sqrt: 9*(2 + 1) = 9*3 = 27. Denominator inside sqrt: 2*(9 - 1) = 2*8=16. So again, sqrt(27/16)=sqrt(27)/sqrt(16)=3√3 / 4. Yep, same result. So that seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the entire expression as sqrt[a(b + 1)/b(a - 1)]? For a=9 and b=2, that would be sqrt[9*(3)/2*8] = sqrt[27/16], same thing. So that's another way to think about it, but in any case, the answer is 3√3 over 4.\n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in arithmetic? Let me check again:\n\na=9, b=2:\n\nab = 18. Correct.\n\nab + a = 18 + 9. 18 + 9 is 27. Correct.\n\nab - b = 18 - 2. 18 - 2 is 16. Correct.\n\nSquare roots:\n\n√27. Since 27 is 9*3, square root of 9 is 3, so 3√3. Correct.\n\n√16 is 4. Correct.\n\nSo 3√3 divided by 4. The problem says to express as a common fraction in simplest radical form. So 3√3 / 4 is already a fraction, and since √3 cannot be simplified further, and 3 and 4 have no common factors, that is simplest radical form. Therefore, the answer is 3√3 over 4.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, is there any step where I might have messed up the order? For example, is the operation a & b defined as sqrt(ab + a) divided by sqrt(ab - b), or is there any chance I misread it? Let me check the original problem again:\n\n\"The operation & is defined for positive integers a and b as a & b = sqrt(ab + a)/sqrt(ab - b). What is the value of 9 & 2? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\"\n\nYes, that's exactly how I interpreted it. So numerator sqrt(ab + a), denominator sqrt(ab - b). So no issue there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they meant sqrt[(ab + a)/(ab - b)]? But that would be the same as sqrt(ab + a)/sqrt(ab - b). Because sqrt(x)/sqrt(y) is sqrt(x/y). So whether you write it as sqrt(x)/sqrt(y) or sqrt(x/y), it's the same thing. So in this case, both interpretations are same. So regardless, the calculation is same. So that's fine.\n\nAnother thing to check: positive integers a and b. Since a and b are positive integers, we need to make sure that the expressions inside the square roots are positive. For the numerator, ab + a = a(b + 1). Since a and b are positive integers, this is definitely positive. For the denominator, ab - b = b(a - 1). Since b is positive, then we need a - 1 > 0, so a > 1. In our case, a is 9, which is greater than 1, so denominator is positive. So that's okay. If a was 1, then denominator would be zero, which is undefined, but since a and b are positive integers and in this case a=9, no problem.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. 3√3 over 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $9 \\& 2$ is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}}.\n</think>"}
