Let me start by recalling what I know about electromagnetic waves and their properties in different media.\n\nFirst, I remember that the time-averaged power (or intensity) of an electromagnetic wave is related to the electric and magnetic field amplitudes. The formula for intensity in a medium is given by:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} c n \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n\nWait, actually, I think the general formula for the intensity (which is power per unit area) is:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} E_0 B_0 $$\n\nBut since $ B_0 = \\frac{E_0}{v} $, where $ v $ is the speed of light in the medium, maybe I need to adjust that. Let me check. The intensity can also be written using the Poynting vector, which is $ \\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} $. For a plane wave, the time-averaged value of the Poynting vector is:\n\n$$ \\langle S \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2 \\mu_0} E_0 B_0 $$\n\nAnd since $ B_0 = \\frac{E_0}{v} $, substituting that in gives:\n\n$$ \\langle S \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2 \\mu_0} E_0 \\left( \\frac{E_0}{v} \\right) = \\frac{E_0^2}{2 \\mu_0 v} $$\n\nBut $ v = \\frac{c}{n} $, where $ n $ is the refractive index of the medium. So substituting that:\n\n$$ \\langle S \\rangle = \\frac{E_0^2 n}{2 \\mu_0 c} $$\n\nAlternatively, since $ \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 c^2 = 1 $, maybe I can express this in terms of $ \\epsilon_0 $. Let me recall that $ v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon}} $, but in a non-magnetic medium, $ \\mu \\approx \\mu_0 $, so $ v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon}} $. However, the refractive index $ n = \\frac{c}{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}} $, assuming non-magnetic material. Therefore, $ \\epsilon = \\epsilon_0 n^2 $. \n\nSo maybe another way to write the intensity is:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\mu}} E_0^2 $$\n\nBut since $ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\mu}} = \\frac{v}{\\mu_0} $, because $ v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon}} $, so $ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\mu}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu v} $. Hmm, getting a bit confused here. Let me try to stick with the earlier expression.\n\nGiven that the intensity $ I $ is given as 100 mW/cm², which I need to convert into SI units. Let me note that 1 mW is 0.001 W, and 1 cm² is $ (0.01 \\, \\text{m})^2 = 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2 $. Therefore, 100 mW/cm² is:\n\n$$ 100 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{W} / 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2 = 1000 \\, \\text{W/m}^2 $$\n\nSo the intensity $ I = 1000 \\, \\text{W/m}^2 $.\n\nNow, I need to relate this intensity to the electric field amplitude $ E_0 $ in water. For that, I need to know the refractive index of water at the wavelength of the ruby laser. The ruby laser emits at 6943 Angstroms, which is 694.3 nm. Let me check the refractive index of water at this wavelength.\n\nI recall that the refractive index of water varies slightly with wavelength, but for visible light, it's approximately around 1.33. However, since the wavelength here is in the red part of the spectrum, maybe I need a more precise value. Let me try to recall or estimate. For water, the refractive index at 650 nm (which is close to 694 nm) is approximately 1.332 or so. Let me check some references... Well, since I can't actually look it up, I'll assume that the refractive index of water is approximately 1.33 for this purpose. However, to be precise, maybe I should use a more accurate value. Wait, the problem doesn't give the refractive index, so perhaps I need to state my assumption? But maybe the problem expects me to use a standard value. Let me proceed with $ n = 1.33 $.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the relation with the speed of light in water. Let me recall that the intensity in a medium can also be expressed as:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} c n \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n\nWait, let me derive this properly. Starting from the Poynting vector. In a medium, the wave impedance is $ \\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\epsilon}} $. For non-magnetic materials, $ \\mu \\approx \\mu_0 $, and $ \\epsilon = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r $, where $ \\epsilon_r $ is the relative permittivity. The refractive index $ n = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_r \\mu_r} \\approx \\sqrt{\\epsilon_r} $, so $ \\epsilon_r = n^2 $. Therefore, the wave impedance is:\n\n$$ \\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0}} \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{c}{n} $$\n\nBecause $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0}} = c $. Therefore, the wave impedance in the medium is $ \\eta = \\frac{c}{n} $.\n\nThe time-averaged Poynting vector (intensity) is:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{E_0^2}{\\eta} $$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{E_0^2 n}{c} $$\n\nWait, since $ \\eta = c/n $, so $ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{E_0^2}{\\eta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{E_0^2 n}{c} $. Therefore:\n\n$$ E_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I c}{n}} $$\n\nIs that correct? Let me check the units. Intensity $ I $ is in W/m², which is J/(s·m²). $ c $ is m/s, so multiplying by $ c $ gives J/(s·m²) * m/s = J/(s²·m). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let me use dimensional analysis for the formula.\n\nLet me recall that in vacuum, the intensity is:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} c \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n\nWhich comes from $ I = \\frac{1}{2} E_0 B_0 / \\mu_0 $, and since $ B_0 = E_0 / c $, so substituting:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2 \\mu_0} E_0^2 / c $$\n\nBut since $ \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2 $, so $ 1/\\mu_0 = c^2 \\epsilon_0 $. Therefore:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} c^2 \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 / c = \\frac{1}{2} c \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n\nWhich matches. So in a medium with refractive index $ n $, the speed of light is $ v = c/n $, and the permittivity is $ \\epsilon = n^2 \\epsilon_0 $. Therefore, the intensity in the medium would be:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} v \\epsilon E_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{c}{n} (n^2 \\epsilon_0) E_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2} c n \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n\nTherefore, solving for $ E_0 $:\n\n$$ E_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I}{c n \\epsilon_0}} $$\n\nWait, so that's different from my previous expression. Which is correct?\n\nEarlier, using the wave impedance, I had:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{E_0^2 n}{c} $$\n\nBut according to this derivation, using the permittivity, it's:\n\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} c n \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n\nTherefore, solving for $ E_0 $:\n\n$$ E_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I}{c n \\epsilon_0}} $$\n\nSo which is correct? Let me check units. Let's take the second formula:\n\n$ c $ is in m/s, $ n $ is dimensionless, $ \\epsilon_0 $ is in F/m (C²/(N·m²)). So the denominator is (m/s * dimensionless * C²/(N·m²)).\n\nWait, let me compute units of $ \\frac{I}{c n \\epsilon_0} $:\n\nI is in W/m² = (J/s)/m² = (N·m/s)/m² = N/(s·m).\n\nDivide by c (m/s), n (dimensionless), and ε₀ (F/m = C²/(N·m²)):\n\nSo overall units:\n\n(N/(s·m)) / [ (m/s) * (C²/(N·m²)) ) ] \n\nLet me compute denominator first:\n\n(m/s) * (C²/(N·m²)) ) = (C²/(N·s·m))\n\nTherefore, overall units:\n\n(N/(s·m)) / (C²/(N·s·m)) ) = (N/(s·m)) * (N·s·m)/C² ) = N² / C²\n\nTherefore, sqrt(N²/C²) is N/C, which is electric field units. Correct. So the formula is correct. Therefore, the correct formula is:\n\n$$ E_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I}{c n \\epsilon_0}} $$\n\nSo I need to use this formula.\n\nGiven that, let me note the values:\n\n- $ I = 1000 \\, \\text{W/m}^2 $\n- $ c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} $\n- $ n $ for water at 694 nm. Let me check... Well, if I can't recall exactly, but since the problem doesn't provide it, maybe I need to assume a value. Let me check standard refractive index of water. At 650 nm, n is approximately 1.332. Let me use n = 1.33 for simplicity. However, to be more precise, perhaps I can use a value from a table. For example, at 650 nm, n ≈ 1.332; at 700 nm, maybe slightly less? Wait, refractive index of water decreases with increasing wavelength (normal dispersion). So at 694 nm, which is longer than 650 nm, the refractive index would be slightly less than 1.332. For example, if at 650 nm it's 1.332, maybe at 700 nm it's about 1.33? But since the problem gives the wavelength as 6943 Angstroms, which is 694.3 nm, so close to 700 nm. Let me check some approximate numbers. \n\nAccording to standard data, the refractive index of water at 589 nm (sodium D line) is about 1.333. At 656 nm (hydrogen alpha), it's about 1.331. At 700 nm, it's approximately 1.330. Let me use n = 1.33 for this problem. However, if more precision is required, but since the problem doesn't give a specific value, maybe I should state my assumption. However, perhaps the problem expects me to use n = 1.33. Let me proceed with n = 1.33.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the formula:\n\n$$ E_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1000}{3.00 \\times 10^8 \\times 1.33 \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-12}}} $$\n\nWait, let me note that $ \\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{F/m} $. Let me compute the denominator first:\n\nFirst compute $ c n \\epsilon_0 $:\n\n$ 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\times 1.33 \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-12} $\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, 3.00 × 1.33 = 3.99\n\nThen, 3.99 × 8.85 ≈ Let me compute 4 × 8.85 = 35.4, subtract 0.01 × 8.85 = 0.0885, so ≈ 35.4 - 0.0885 ≈ 35.3115\n\nTherefore, approximately 35.3115 × 10^{-4} because 10^8 × 10^{-12} = 10^{-4}\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nOriginal calculation:\n\nc is 3e8 m/s\n\nn is 1.33\n\nepsilon_0 is 8.85e-12 F/m\n\nSo multiplying together:\n\n3e8 * 1.33 * 8.85e-12 = 3 * 1.33 * 8.85 * 1e8 * 1e-12 = 3 * 1.33 * 8.85 * 1e-4\n\nCompute 3 * 1.33 = 3.99\n\nThen 3.99 * 8.85 ≈ Let's calculate 4 * 8.85 = 35.4, minus 0.01 * 8.85 = 0.0885, so 35.4 - 0.0885 = 35.3115\n\nTherefore, total is 35.3115 × 1e-4 ≈ 3.53115 × 1e-3 ≈ 3.531 × 10^{-3}\n\nSo the denominator is approximately 3.531 × 10^{-3} (units? Let me check. The units of c n ε₀ are (m/s) * dimensionless * (F/m) = (F·m/s). But F is C²/(N·m²), so (C²/(N·m²)) * m/s = C²/(N·m·s). Not sure, but the numerical value is 3.531 × 10^{-3}.\n\nThen, the numerator is 2 * I = 2 * 1000 = 2000 W/m².\n\nTherefore, the entire fraction is:\n\n2000 / 3.531 × 10^{-3} ≈ 2000 / 0.003531 ≈ Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 2000 / 0.003531 ≈ 2000 / 0.0035 ≈ 2000 / 0.0035 = 2000 / (3.5 × 10^{-3}) ) = 2000 / 3.5 × 10^3 ≈ 571.4 × 10^3 ≈ 5.714 × 10^5\n\nBut with the exact denominator 0.003531, so:\n\nLet me compute 2000 / 0.003531 ≈ 2000 / 0.003531 ≈ 2000 * 283.2 ≈ 566,400 (since 1 / 0.003531 ≈ 283.2). Therefore approximately 5.664 × 10^5.\n\nTherefore, E_0 = sqrt(5.664 × 10^5) ≈ Let me compute sqrt(5.664 × 10^5).\n\nFirst, sqrt(10^5) = 316.23, sqrt(5.664) ≈ 2.38, so total is approx 2.38 * 316.23 ≈ 752 V/m.\n\nWait, let me check with more precise calculation:\n\nsqrt(5.664 × 10^5) = sqrt(5.664) × sqrt(10^5) ≈ 2.38 × 316.23 ≈ 2.38 * 300 = 714, 2.38 * 16.23 ≈ 38.6, total ≈ 714 + 38.6 ≈ 752.6 V/m.\n\nSo approximately 753 V/m. Let me check with more precise numbers.\n\nBut let me go back to the exact numbers:\n\nOriginal calculation:\n\nDenominator was 3.531 × 10^{-3}, numerator 2000:\n\nSo 2000 / 3.531 × 10^{-3} = 2000 / 0.003531 ≈ 566,400 (as above). Therefore sqrt(566,400) ≈ 752.6 V/m.\n\nSo E_0 ≈ 753 V/m. Let me check if my approximated numbers are correct.\n\nBut let me redo the calculation with more precise intermediate steps.\n\nFirst, let's compute c * n * ε₀:\n\nc = 3.00 × 10^8 m/s\n\nn = 1.33\n\nε₀ = 8.85 × 10^{-12} F/m\n\nSo c * n * ε₀ = 3.00 × 1.33 × 8.85 × 10^{8 - 12} = 3.00 × 1.33 × 8.85 × 10^{-4}\n\nCompute 3.00 × 1.33 = 3.99\n\nThen 3.99 × 8.85:\n\nLet me compute 3.99 × 8.85:\n\nFirst, 4 × 8.85 = 35.4\n\nMinus 0.01 × 8.85 = 0.0885\n\nSo 35.4 - 0.0885 = 35.3115\n\nTherefore, c * n * ε₀ = 35.3115 × 10^{-4} = 3.53115 × 10^{-3} (correct)\n\nThen 2I / (c n ε₀) = 2 * 1000 / 3.53115 × 10^{-3} = 2000 / 0.00353115 ≈ 566,400\n\nSo sqrt(566,400) ≈ 752.6 V/m. So approximately 753 V/m. Let me check with a calculator.\n\nWait, 750^2 = 562,500\n\n753^2 = (750 + 3)^2 = 750^2 + 2*750*3 + 3^2 = 562,500 + 4,500 + 9 = 567,009. So 567,009 is 753^2. Our value is 566,400, which is a bit less. Let me compute sqrt(566,400):\n\nLet me compute 752.6^2:\n\nWell, since 752.6 is 753 - 0.4.\n\nSo (753 - 0.4)^2 = 753^2 - 2*753*0.4 + 0.4^2 ≈ 567,009 - 602.4 + 0.16 ≈ 567,009 - 602.4 = 566,406.6 + 0.16 ≈ 566,406.76. Which is very close to 566,400. Therefore, sqrt(566,400) ≈ 752.6 V/m. So E_0 ≈ 752.6 V/m. Let me round it to 753 V/m.\n\nBut let me check if I made an error in calculation steps. Let me recheck:\n\nGiven:\n\nI = 1000 W/m²\n\nc = 3.00e8 m/s\n\nn = 1.33\n\nε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m\n\nSo:\n\nE_0 = sqrt(2 * I / (c * n * ε₀))\n\nCompute denominator:\n\nc * n * ε₀ = 3.00e8 * 1.33 * 8.85e-12\n\nLet me compute 3.00e8 * 8.85e-12 first:\n\n3.00 * 8.85 = 26.55\n\nSo 26.55e-4 (since 1e8 * 1e-12 = 1e-4)\n\nThen multiply by 1.33:\n\n26.55 * 1.33 ≈ Let me compute 26.55 * 1.3 = 34.515, plus 26.55 * 0.03 = 0.7965 → total ≈ 34.515 + 0.7965 ≈ 35.3115, so 35.3115e-4 ≈ 3.53115e-3. Correct.\n\nSo 2 * I / (c n ε₀) = 2000 / 3.53115e-3 ≈ 566,400. Then sqrt(566,400) ≈ 752.6 V/m. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the electric field amplitude is approximately 753 V/m.\n\nNow, for the magnetic field amplitude, since in a plane wave, the magnetic field amplitude is related to the electric field by:\n\n$$ B_0 = \\frac{E_0}{v} $$\n\nWhere $ v $ is the speed of light in the medium, which is $ c/n $.\n\nAlternatively, since $ B_0 = \\frac{E_0}{c} n $, because $ v = c/n $, so $ 1/v = n/c $, so $ B_0 = E_0 / v = E_0 n / c $.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$ B_0 = \\frac{n}{c} E_0 $$\n\nSo substituting the numbers:\n\nn = 1.33, c = 3.00e8 m/s, E_0 ≈ 752.6 V/m:\n\n$$ B_0 = \\frac{1.33}{3.00 \\times 10^8} \\times 752.6 $$\n\nCompute numerator: 1.33 * 752.6 ≈ Let me calculate 1.33 * 750 = 1.33 * 700 + 1.33 * 50 = 931 + 66.5 = 997.5. Then 1.33 * 2.6 ≈ 3.458. Total ≈ 997.5 + 3.458 ≈ 1000.958 T? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, 1.33 * 752.6 ≈ Let me do 1.33 * 752.6:\n\nFirst, 752.6 * 1 = 752.6\n\n752.6 * 0.3 = 225.78\n\n752.6 * 0.03 = 22.578\n\nTotal: 752.6 + 225.78 = 978.38 + 22.578 ≈ 1000.958\n\nTherefore, numerator ≈ 1000.958 T·m/s ?\n\nWait, no, units:\n\nE_0 is in V/m, which is equivalent to T·m/s (since 1 V/m = 1 T·m/s). Therefore, multiplying by n (dimensionless) and dividing by c (m/s) gives:\n\nB_0 = (n / c) * E_0 → units: (dimensionless / (m/s)) * (T·m/s) ) = T. Correct.\n\nSo the numerical value is approximately 1000.958 / 3.00e8 ≈ 3.3365 × 10^{-6} T ≈ 3.34 × 10^{-6} T.\n\nWhich is 3.34 microtesla.\n\nLet me check with precise numbers:\n\n1000.958 / 3.00e8 = approx 1000.958 / 3e8 ≈ 3.3365e-6 T ≈ 3.34 × 10^{-6} T.\n\nTherefore, B_0 ≈ 3.34 μT.\n\nAlternatively, using exact numbers:\n\nSince E_0 ≈ 752.6 V/m, then B_0 = E_0 / v = E_0 * n / c.\n\nSo:\n\nB_0 = 752.6 * 1.33 / 3.00e8 ≈ 752.6 * 1.33 ≈ 1000.958 as before, divided by 3e8 ≈ 3.34e-6 T.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the amplitudes are approximately E_0 ≈ 753 V/m and B_0 ≈ 3.34 × 10^{-6} T.\n\nBut let me check if I used the correct formula for B_0. Another way is from the intrinsic impedance of the medium. The intrinsic impedance η = sqrt(μ/ε) ≈ μ_0 / sqrt(ε_0 ε_r) ) = μ_0 / (sqrt(ε_0) sqrt(ε_r)) ) = μ_0 / (sqrt(ε_0) n) ) because ε_r = n². Since μ_0 ε_0 = 1/c², so sqrt(ε_0) = 1/(c sqrt(μ_0)) ). Therefore:\n\nη = μ_0 / [ (1/(c sqrt(μ_0)) ) * n ] = μ_0 * c sqrt(μ_0) / n = c μ_0^{3/2} / n. Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, since earlier we had η = c/n, but that was in another approach. Wait, earlier I had η = c/n? Wait, no, earlier I had η = sqrt(μ/ε) = sqrt(μ_0 / (ε_0 n²)) ) = (1/n) sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) ) = (1/n) * sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0). But sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) is sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) = sqrt( (4π × 10^{-7} H/m) / (8.85 × 10^{-12} F/m) )) ≈ sqrt( (4π / 8.85) × 10^5 ) ≈ sqrt( (1.414) × 10^5 ) ≈ 377 Ω, which is the impedance of free space. Therefore, η_medium = η_0 / n ≈ 377 Ω / n. Therefore, since η = E_0 / B_0, then B_0 = E_0 / η = E_0 n / η_0. Therefore, B_0 = E_0 n / (377 Ω). Let me compute that.\n\nGiven E_0 ≈ 753 V/m, n = 1.33:\n\nB_0 = (753 * 1.33) / 377 ≈ 1000.958 / 377 ≈ 2.655 T? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, η_0 is 377 Ω, so B_0 = E_0 / η_0 * n? Wait:\n\nWait, η_medium = η_0 / n. Therefore, η_medium = E_0 / B_0 → B_0 = E_0 / η_medium = E_0 * n / η_0. Therefore:\n\nB_0 = (753 V/m * 1.33) / 377 Ω ≈ (1000.958) / 377 ≈ 2.655 T? Wait, that can't be right. Earlier calculation gave 3.34e-6 T. There is a discrepancy here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, let me check units. η is in ohms. E_0 is in V/m. B_0 is in T. Let me check the relation:\n\nFrom η = E_0 / B_0 → B_0 = E_0 / η.\n\nSo η_medium = η_0 / n, so B_0 = E_0 * n / η_0.\n\nBut η_0 is 377 Ω. Let me compute:\n\nE_0 is 753 V/m. Multiply by n=1.33: 753 * 1.33 ≈ 1000 V/m.\n\nDivide by 377 Ω: 1000 / 377 ≈ 2.65 T? But that contradicts the previous result of ~3.34e-6 T. There's a problem here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, there must be a mistake in the units. Wait, E_0 is in V/m, η is in ohms (Ω), which is V/A. But B_0 is in tesla. Let me recall the relation between E and B in terms of impedance. The intrinsic impedance η is defined as E/H, where H is the magnetic field intensity (A/m). The magnetic flux density B is μ H. Therefore, B = μ H. Therefore, H = B / μ. Therefore, η = E / H = E μ / B → B = E μ / η.\n\nBut in a medium, η = sqrt(μ/ε). Therefore, B = E sqrt(ε/μ) * μ / sqrt(μ/ε) )? Wait, this seems confusing. Let me do it step by step.\n\nGiven that η = E_0 / H_0, where H_0 is the magnetic field intensity (A/m). And B_0 = μ H_0. Therefore, B_0 = μ H_0 = μ E_0 / η.\n\nBut η = sqrt(μ / ε) → η^2 = μ / ε → μ = η^2 ε. Therefore:\n\nB_0 = μ E_0 / η = η^2 ε E_0 / η = η ε E_0.\n\nBut η = sqrt(μ / ε) = sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) / n = η_0 / n. Therefore:\n\nB_0 = (η_0 / n) * ε * E_0.\n\nBut ε = ε_0 n². Therefore:\n\nB_0 = (η_0 / n) * ε_0 n² * E_0 = η_0 ε_0 n E_0.\n\nBut η_0 = sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) = 377 Ω. Also, μ_0 ε_0 = 1/c². Therefore:\n\nB_0 = sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) * ε_0 n E_0 = sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) * ε_0 n E_0 = sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) * ε_0 n E_0.\n\nWait, sqrt(μ_0 / ε_0) is η_0 = 377 Ω. Then:\n\nB_0 = 377 * ε_0 * n * E_0.\n\nBut ε_0 is 8.85e-12 F/m. Let me compute that:\n\nB_0 = 377 * 8.85e-12 * 1.33 * 753.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst compute 377 * 8.85e-12 ≈ 377 * 8.85 ≈ Let's approximate:\n\n377 * 8.85 ≈ 377 * 8 + 377 * 0.85 ≈ 3016 + 320.45 ≈ 3336.45 → 3336.45e-12 ≈ 3.336e-9.\n\nThen multiply by 1.33 * 753 ≈ 1.33 * 753 ≈ 1000 as before.\n\nSo total B_0 ≈ 3.336e-9 * 1000 ≈ 3.336e-6 T ≈ 3.34 μT. Which matches the previous result. So earlier when I did B_0 = E_0 * n / η_0, I forgot that η_0 is 377 Ω, and the correct formula is B_0 = η_0 ε_0 n E_0. However, if I use the relation B_0 = E_0 / v, where v = c/n, then:\n\nB_0 = E_0 n / c.\n\nLet me compute that with numbers:\n\nE_0 ≈ 753 V/m, n = 1.33, c = 3e8 m/s:\n\nB_0 ≈ 753 * 1.33 / 3e8 ≈ 1000 / 3e8 ≈ 3.33e-6 T. Correct. So my previous calculation was correct, and the confusion came from incorrectly applying the intrinsic impedance formula without considering the proper relations between B and H. So the correct value is indeed ~3.34 μT.\n\nTherefore, the amplitudes are approximately:\n\nElectric field: ~753 V/m\n\nMagnetic field: ~3.34 × 10^{-6} T\n\nLet me check if these numbers make sense. In vacuum, for the same intensity, what would E_0 be?\n\nIn vacuum, using I = 1000 W/m²:\n\nE_0 = sqrt(2 I / (c ε_0)) = sqrt(2 * 1000 / (3e8 * 8.85e-12)) ≈ sqrt(2000 / 2.655e-3) ≈ sqrt(753,000) ≈ 868 V/m. Which is higher than in water because the refractive index is higher (slower wave, same intensity implies lower E field amplitude). Wait, but in water, n=1.33, so the speed is lower, but the permittivity is higher. So in water, since ε is higher, for the same intensity, E_0 would be lower? Wait, no, according to the formula E_0 = sqrt(2 I / (c n ε_0)). Since in vacuum, n=1, so in water, with n=1.33, the denominator is larger, so E_0 is smaller. Which is what we found: 753 V/m in water vs 868 V/m in vacuum. Makes sense because in water, the wave has lower speed, but higher permittivity. So the E field is lower for same intensity. Correct.\n\nAlso, the magnetic field in vacuum would be B_0 = E_0 / c ≈ 868 / 3e8 ≈ 2.89e-6 T. In water, B_0 is 3.34e-6 T, which is higher, because B_0 = E_0 * n / c. Since E_0 decreased by ~sqrt(n) (from 868 to 753, which is approx 868 / 1.33 ≈ 653, but actually it's 753 which is higher than that... Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, formula is E_0 = sqrt(2 I / (c n ε_0)). So if n increases, E_0 decreases as 1/sqrt(n). For n = 1.33, sqrt(n) ≈ 1.15. So E_0 in water is E_0_vacuum / sqrt(n) ≈ 868 / 1.15 ≈ 755 V/m, which matches our calculation. Then B_0 in water is E_0 * n / c = (E_0_vacuum / sqrt(n)) * n / c = E_0_vacuum * sqrt(n) / c. Which is sqrt(n) times higher than in vacuum. Since B_0_vacuum = E_0_vacuum / c. So in water, B_0 = sqrt(n) * B_0_vacuum ≈ 1.15 * 2.89e-6 ≈ 3.32e-6 T, which matches our result. So all consistent.\n\nTherefore, my calculations seem correct.\n\nNow, let me present the final answers. The problem says \"amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields\". So I need to box both values. Let me check if I need to consider any other factors, like absorption or anything else. The problem states it's propagating through water and gives the time-averaged power, so I assume water is treated as a lossless medium for this ruby laser wavelength. So no absorption considered here, just the refractive index.\n\nTherefore, the amplitudes are approximately:\n\nElectric field amplitude $ E_0 \\approx 753 \\, \\text{V/m} $\n\nMagnetic field amplitude $ B_0 \\approx 3.34 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{T} $\n\nBut let me check my calculation again for E_0 with precise numbers. Let me use more exact values for constants.\n\nLet me use exact values:\n\nc = 2.99792 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 3.00 × 10^8 m/s (as given earlier)\n\nε₀ = 8.854187817 × 10^{-12} F/m ≈ 8.85 × 10^{-12} F/m\n\nn = 1.33\n\nI = 1000 W/m²\n\nSo let me recalculate E_0 with more precise numbers:\n\nFirst compute denominator: c * n * ε₀\n\nc = 3.00 × 10^8 m/s\n\nn = 1.33\n\nε₀ = 8.85 × 10^{-12} F/m\n\nSo:\n\n3.00 × 1.33 × 8.85 × 10^{-4} = 3 * 1.33 * 8.85 × 10^{-4} = 3 * 11.7555 × 10^{-4} = 35.2665 × 10^{-4} = 3.52665 × 10^{-3}\n\nThen 2I / denominator = 2000 / 3.52665 × 10^{-3} ≈ 2000 / 0.00352665 ≈ Let's compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me calculate 1 / 0.00352665 ≈ 283.6 (since 1 / 0.0035 ≈ 285.7). Let me do precise division:\n\nLet me note that 0.00352665 × 283.6 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 0.00352665 × 283.6 ≈ Let me approximate:\n\nFirst, 0.0035 × 283.6 ≈ 1.0 (since 0.0035 * 285.7 ≈ 1.0). So 0.00352665 is slightly larger than 0.0035, so 1 / 0.00352665 ≈ slightly less than 285.7. Let me compute:\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps:\n\nLet me denote x = 0.00352665\n\nFind 1/x.\n\nLet me approximate using Newton-Raphson method. Let me take an initial guess y₀ = 283.6.\n\nCompute y₀ * x = 283.6 * 0.00352665 ≈ Let me compute 283.6 * 0.0035 = 1.0, and 283.6 * 0.00002665 ≈ 283.6 * 2.665e-5 ≈ approx 283.6 * 2.665e-5 ≈ 0.00756. So total ≈ 1.0 + 0.00756 ≈ 1.00756. Therefore, y₀ * x ≈ 1.00756. The error is 1.00756 - 1 = 0.00756. Using Newton-Raphson:\n\ny₁ = y₀ - y₀*(y₀*x - 1) = y₀ - y₀*(error) = 283.6 - 283.6 * 0.00756 ≈ 283.6 - 2.143 ≈ 281.46.\n\nNow compute y₁ * x = 281.46 * 0.00352665 ≈ Let me approximate:\n\nFirst, 281.46 * 0.0035 ≈ 0.985, and 281.46 * 0.00002665 ≈ approx 281.46 * 2.665e-5 ≈ 0.0075. Total ≈ 0.985 + 0.0075 ≈ 0.9925. Error is 0.9925 - 1 = -0.0075. Next iteration:\n\ny₂ = y₁ - y₁*(y₁*x - 1) = 281.46 - 281.46*(-0.0075) ≈ 281.46 + 2.11 ≈ 283.57.\n\nCompute y₂*x ≈ 283.57 * 0.00352665 ≈ Let's approximate as before:\n\n≈ 283.57 * 0.0035 + 283.57 * 0.00002665 ≈ 0.9925 + 0.00756 ≈ 1.000. So y₂ ≈ 283.57 gives y*x ≈ 1.000. Therefore, 1/x ≈ 283.57. Therefore, 2000 / x ≈ 2000 * 283.57 ≈ 567,140.\n\nTherefore, E_0 = sqrt(567,140) ≈ sqrt(5.6714 × 10^5) ≈ sqrt(5.6714) × sqrt(10^5) ≈ 2.38 × 316.23 ≈ 755 V/m.\n\nSo with more precise calculation, E_0 ≈ 755 V/m. Previously I had 753, so it's about 755 V/m. Let me take it as approximately 755 V/m.\n\nSimilarly, B_0 = E_0 * n / c = 755 * 1.33 / 3.00e8 ≈ 755 * 1.33 ≈ 1003.15 / 3.00e8 ≈ 3.3438e-6 T ≈ 3.34 × 10^{-6} T.\n\nTherefore, rounding to three significant figures, since the given intensity is 100 mW/cm² (which is two significant figures? Wait, 100 mW/cm² is given as 100, which could be one or two or three significant figures depending on context. But since it's written as 100, maybe it's two significant figures. However, the wavelength is given as 6943 Å, which is four significant figures. But since the problem says \"an appropriate approximation\", maybe the wavelength is not precise. Anyway, since the refractive index was assumed as 1.33 (three significant figures), and constants are known with more precision, I think we can present the answers with three significant figures.\n\nTherefore:\n\nE_0 ≈ 755 V/m ≈ 7.55 × 10² V/m\n\nB_0 ≈ 3.34 × 10^{-6} T\n\nBut let me check if the question expects symbolic expressions or numerical values. The problem says \"What are the amplitudes...\", so numerical values are expected.\n\nBut to ensure accuracy, let me redo the calculation with precise constants.\n\nLet me take:\n\nc = 2.99792 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 3.00 × 10^8 m/s (error ~0.1%)\n\nε₀ = 8.854187817 × 10^{-12} F/m\n\nn = 1.33\n\nI = 1000 W/m²\n\nCompute E_0:\n\nE_0 = sqrt(2 * I / (c * n * ε₀)) \n\nLet me compute denominator:\n\nc * n * ε₀ = 2.99792e8 * 1.33 * 8.854187817e-12 \n\nFirst compute 2.99792 * 1.33 ≈ 3.98723\n\nThen multiply by 8.854187817e-12:\n\n3.98723 * 8.854187817 ≈ Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 4 * 8.854 ≈ 35.416, subtract 0.01277 * 8.854 ≈ approx 0.113, so ≈ 35.416 - 0.113 ≈ 35.303.\n\nTherefore, denominator ≈ 35.303e-4 = 3.5303e-3.\n\nTherefore, 2 * I / denominator = 2000 / 3.5303e-3 ≈ 2000 / 0.0035303 ≈ 566,500.\n\nThen sqrt(566,500) ≈ 752.7 V/m. Wait, but earlier with more precise calculation, I had approx 755 V/m. The discrepancy comes from the precise value of c. If I use c = 3.00e8, then the denominator is 3.53e-3, and 2000 / 3.53e-3 ≈ 566,572, sqrt ≈ 753 V/m. But with precise c, it's slightly less. However, since in the problem they probably expect using c = 3.00e8 m/s, let's stick with that.\n\nTherefore, using c = 3.00e8 m/s, E_0 ≈ 753 V/m, B_0 ≈ 3.34e-6 T.\n\nBut let me do the exact calculation with c = 3.00e8 m/s:\n\nE_0 = sqrt(2 * 1000 / (3.00e8 * 1.33 * 8.85e-12)) \n\nCalculate denominator:\n\n3.00e8 * 1.33 = 3.99e8\n\n3.99e8 * 8.85e-12 = 3.99 * 8.85 * 1e-4 = 35.3115 * 1e-4 = 3.53115e-3\n\nSo 2 * 1000 / 3.53115e-3 = 2000 / 0.00353115 ≈ 566,400\n\nsqrt(566,400) ≈ 752.6 V/m. So 753 V/m when rounded to three significant figures.\n\nSimilarly, B_0 = 752.6 * 1.33 / 3.00e8 ≈ 1000.56 / 3.00e8 ≈ 3.335e-6 T ≈ 3.34e-6 T.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nElectric field amplitude: approximately 753 V/m\n\nMagnetic field amplitude: approximately 3.34 × 10^{-6} T\n\nBut let me check with another approach for E_0. For example, using the relation between intensity and electric field in terms of the intrinsic impedance.\n\nThe intensity is also given by I = (E_0^2) / (2 η), where η is the intrinsic impedance of the medium. For water, η = η_0 / n, where η_0 ≈ 377 Ω.\n\nTherefore:\n\nI = E_0^2 / (2 * η_0 / n) ) = E_0^2 * n / (2 η_0)\n\nSolving for E_0:\n\nE_0 = sqrt(2 I η_0 / n)\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nI = 1000 W/m²\n\nη_0 = 377 Ω\n\nn = 1.33\n\nSo:\n\nE_0 = sqrt(2 * 1000 * 377 / 1.33) ≈ sqrt(2000 * 377 / 1.33)\n\nCompute 2000 * 377 = 754,000\n\nDivide by 1.33: 754,000 / 1.33 ≈ 566,917\n\nThen sqrt(566,917) ≈ 753 V/m. Exactly the same result! So this confirms the previous calculation. Therefore, E_0 ≈ 753 V/m.\n\nTherefore, the answers are consistent across different methods. Hence, I can be confident in these results.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields are $\\boxed{753 \\, \\text{V/m}}$ and $\\boxed{3.34 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{T}}$, respectively.\n</think>"}
