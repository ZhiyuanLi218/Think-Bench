So the problem is about a car moving up an incline. The car is going at speed v when it reaches the bottom of a hill inclined at angle θ. It coasts up without using the engine, and we have to figure out the horizontal and vertical components of its acceleration, neglecting friction and air resistance. The options are A through D, each giving different combinations of ax and ay.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when an object moves up an incline without any applied force. Since there's no friction or air resistance, the only force acting on the car once it's on the incline is gravity. So, the acceleration must be due to gravity. But how does that break down into horizontal and vertical components?\n\nWait, the question is about the acceleration components. Let me think. When you have an object on an incline, usually we resolve the acceleration along the incline and perpendicular to it. But here, they're asking for horizontal and vertical components. Hmm.\n\nSo, gravity acts downward, which is vertically. But when the car is moving up the incline, its acceleration vector will be directed down the incline, right? Because gravity is decelerating it as it goes up. But how does that translate into horizontal and vertical components?\n\nLet me draw a mental picture. The incline is at angle θ. The car is moving up the incline. The acceleration due to gravity is straight down. But if we want to find the horizontal and vertical components of the car's acceleration, we need to resolve the acceleration vector into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions.\n\nBut first, what is the direction of the acceleration? Since the car is coasting up the incline, it's slowing down. The acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion, which is down the incline. So the acceleration vector is pointing down the incline. Therefore, we need to take that acceleration vector and break it into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to first find the acceleration along the incline and then resolve that into horizontal and vertical components. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe acceleration along the incline is due to gravity. The component of gravity along the incline is g*sinθ, directed down the incline. Therefore, the acceleration along the incline is -g*sinθ (negative because it's opposite to the direction of motion). Now, we need to resolve this acceleration into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nLet me consider the coordinate system. Let's assume that the x-axis is horizontal and the y-axis is vertical. The incline makes an angle θ with the horizontal. The acceleration vector is directed down the incline, which is at angle θ above the horizontal? Wait, no. The incline is θ above the horizontal, so the direction down the incline is θ below the horizontal? Wait, if the incline is going up at angle θ, then the direction down the incline would be θ below the horizontal? Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the incline is at angle θ with respect to the horizontal, then the direction of the acceleration (down the incline) is θ below the horizontal? No, actually, if the incline is rising at θ, then the direction down the incline is θ below the horizontal? Wait, maybe it's better to draw a diagram.\n\nAlternatively, think about the angle between the acceleration vector and the horizontal. The acceleration is directed down the incline. So if the incline is θ above the horizontal, then the acceleration vector is θ below the horizontal? Wait, if the incline is going up θ degrees from the horizontal, then the direction down the incline is θ degrees below the horizontal. So the acceleration vector makes an angle θ with the horizontal, but downward.\n\nYes, that seems right. So if I have an acceleration vector of magnitude a = g*sinθ, directed down the incline, which is θ below the horizontal. Then, the horizontal component of acceleration ax would be a*cosθ, and the vertical component ay would be -a*sinθ (negative because it's downward). Let me check that.\n\nIf the acceleration vector is at angle θ below the horizontal, then:\n\nax = a * cosθ\n\nay = -a * sinθ\n\nSince a = g*sinθ, substituting:\n\nax = g*sinθ * cosθ\n\nay = -g*sinθ * sinθ = -g*sin²θ\n\nBut the question is about the magnitude of ax and ay. So magnitude of ax is g*sinθ*cosθ, and magnitude of ay is g*sin²θ.\n\nNow, comparing these to g. For ax, since sinθ*cosθ is less than 1 (because both sinθ and cosθ are less than 1 for θ between 0 and 90 degrees), then ax is less than g. Similarly, ay is g*sin²θ, which is less than g as well, since sin²θ is less than 1. Therefore, both ax and ay are less than g. However, looking at the answer options, none of them say both are less than g. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA: ax = 0; ay < g\n\nB: ax = 0; ay = g\n\nC: ax < g; ay < g\n\nD: ax < g; ay = g\n\nWait, according to my calculation, ax is g*sinθ*cosθ which is less than g, and ay is g*sin²θ which is less than g. So that would be option C. But wait, is this correct?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in resolving the components. Let me check again. The acceleration is directed down the incline. Let me consider another approach. The only force acting on the car is gravity, which is straight down. So the acceleration is straight down, with magnitude g. But the problem is asking for the components of acceleration in the horizontal and vertical directions. Wait, if the acceleration is straight down, then the horizontal component of acceleration should be zero? Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion.\n\nWait, hold on. If the only force is gravity, which is vertical, then the acceleration is purely vertical, downward, with magnitude g. Therefore, the horizontal component of acceleration ax should be zero, and the vertical component ay should be -g. But that's in the case when the car is in free fall. However, the car is on an incline. Wait, no. Wait, the car is moving up the incline, but the only force is gravity. So the acceleration is still due to gravity. But the car is on the incline, so does that affect the acceleration? Wait, no. If there is no friction, then the only force is gravity. The normal force is also acting perpendicular to the incline, but since the car is on the incline, the normal force would balance the component of gravity perpendicular to the incline. But the acceleration is only due to the component of gravity along the incline.\n\nWait, so maybe I confused something here. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen the car is on the incline, there are two forces: gravity downward, and the normal force perpendicular to the incline. The net force on the car is the component of gravity along the incline, which causes acceleration down the incline. The normal force cancels the component of gravity perpendicular to the incline.\n\nSo the acceleration of the car is along the incline, with magnitude g*sinθ. Therefore, this acceleration is a vector pointing down the incline. Now, if I want to find the horizontal and vertical components of this acceleration, I need to resolve the acceleration vector into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the acceleration vector is at angle θ below the horizontal, but actually, if the incline is at angle θ above the horizontal, then the direction down the incline is θ below the horizontal? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nImagine the incline is a slope going up to the right at angle θ. The direction down the incline is along the slope towards the left and downward. So relative to the horizontal axis, the acceleration vector is pointing down the slope. The angle between the acceleration vector and the vertical?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use coordinate systems. Let me define the horizontal as x-axis and vertical as y-axis. The acceleration vector is along the incline, which is at angle θ from the horizontal. But the acceleration is directed down the incline, so if the incline is rising at θ, the acceleration vector is at angle θ below the horizontal? Wait, no. If the incline is at θ above the horizontal, then the direction down the incline is θ below the horizontal? No, actually, if you are moving up the incline, then the direction down the incline is along the slope. The slope is at angle θ above the horizontal, so the direction down the slope is θ below the horizontal? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nIf the incline is θ above the horizontal, then the slope makes angle θ with the horizontal. So, if you are going up the slope, the direction down the slope is the same as the slope's direction but downward. So, if the slope is going up θ from horizontal, then the direction down the slope is θ below the horizontal? Yes, that seems correct. So the acceleration vector is at angle θ below the horizontal. Therefore, to resolve it into horizontal and vertical components, we can use trigonometry.\n\nIf the acceleration has magnitude a = g*sinθ and is directed θ below the horizontal, then:\n\nHorizontal component ax = a*cosθ = g*sinθ*cosθ\n\nVertical component ay = -a*sinθ = -g*sinθ*sinθ = -g*sin²θ\n\nSo the magnitude of ax is g*sinθ*cosθ and magnitude of ay is g*sin²θ. Both of these are less than g because sinθ and cosθ are less than 1 for 0 < θ < 90 degrees. Therefore, ax < g and ay < g. So the correct answer would be option C.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that if the only force is gravity, then the acceleration is purely vertical. But that's not the case here because the car is constrained to move along the incline. The normal force is acting on the car, which affects the acceleration. The net acceleration is not just due to gravity alone but due to the combination of gravity and the normal force. However, since the car is on the incline, the normal force cancels the component of gravity perpendicular to the incline, leaving only the component along the incline. Therefore, the net acceleration is along the incline with magnitude g*sinθ. Therefore, resolving that into horizontal and vertical components gives non-zero horizontal and vertical components. So ax is not zero. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect because they say ax is zero. So between C and D.\n\nBut according to my calculation, both ax and ay are less than g. So option C. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Let me try another approach. Let's use coordinate system aligned with the incline. Let me consider the acceleration along the incline is -g*sinθ (negative because it's down the incline). Now, if I want to convert this acceleration into the horizontal and vertical components, I need to relate the coordinate systems.\n\nLet me denote the coordinate system with x horizontal and y vertical. The acceleration along the incline (let's call that direction 's') is a_s = -g*sinθ. The acceleration in x and y can be found by projecting a_s onto x and y.\n\nIf the incline is at angle θ above the horizontal, then the direction of 's' (the incline) makes an angle θ with the horizontal. So the acceleration vector a_s is in the direction opposite to the incline, i.e., down the incline, which is θ below the horizontal. Therefore, as before, the components are:\n\na_x = a_s * cosθ = -g*sinθ*cosθ\n\na_y = a_s * sinθ = -g*sinθ*sinθ\n\nTherefore, the magnitudes are |a_x| = g*sinθ*cosθ and |a_y| = g*sin²θ. Both are less than g. So ax is less than g and ay is less than g. So option C. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: if there's no horizontal forces, why is there a horizontal acceleration? Because the acceleration is along the incline, which has a horizontal component. The normal force is perpendicular to the incline, which does have a horizontal component. Wait, but earlier I thought the net acceleration is along the incline. Let me think about forces.\n\nThe forces on the car are gravity (mg downward) and normal force (N perpendicular to incline). The net force is mg sinθ down the incline. Therefore, acceleration is g sinθ down the incline. Therefore, the acceleration vector is down the incline. Therefore, breaking that into horizontal and vertical components gives ax and ay as above. Therefore, ax is not zero. Therefore, options A and B are wrong. Between C and D.\n\nBut another approach: if I consider the acceleration components. Since the only external force is gravity (vertical), but the car is constrained to move along the incline. However, the normal force is also acting. So the net acceleration isn't just g downward. The normal force affects the acceleration. But the net acceleration is along the incline. Therefore, the acceleration has both horizontal and vertical components. Therefore, ax is not zero. Therefore, options A and B are out.\n\nBut let's check if ay is equal to g or less. If there were no incline, and the car was in free fall, then ay would be g downward. But here, the car is on an incline, so the vertical component of acceleration is less because part of the gravitational force is being countered by the normal force. Therefore, ay is less than g. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute ay from the components. The acceleration down the incline has a vertical component. Since the acceleration vector is down the incline, which is at angle θ below the horizontal, then the vertical component is negative (downward) and equal to a*sinθ where a is the magnitude of acceleration along the incline. Since a is g*sinθ, then ay = -g*sin²θ. So magnitude is g*sin²θ < g. Therefore, ay < g. Hence, option C: ax < g and ay < g.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Suppose θ = 0 degrees, meaning the incline is flat, horizontal. Then the acceleration along the incline would be g*sin(0) = 0. Therefore, ax = 0 and ay = 0. But θ=0 is a horizontal surface. If the car is moving on a horizontal surface with no friction, then there is no acceleration, so ax=0 and ay=0. Which matches. If θ approaches 90 degrees, meaning vertical, then the incline is vertical. The acceleration along the incline is g*sin(90°) = g downward. Then, resolving into horizontal and vertical components: if θ is 90°, then the acceleration is straight down, so ax = 0 (because cos(90°)=0), and ay = -g. But according to our formula, ax = g*sinθ*cosθ. For θ=90°, sinθ=1, cosθ=0, so ax=0. ay = g*sin²θ = g*1 = g. Wait, but earlier I said ay would be -g*sin²θ, magnitude g*sin²θ. But when θ=90°, the acceleration is straight down with magnitude g, so ay should be -g. But according to the formula, ay = -g*sin²θ = -g*(1) = -g. So magnitude is g. Therefore, when θ approaches 90°, ay approaches g. But according to our previous conclusion, ay < g. But in this case, when θ=90°, ay = g. So perhaps there is a mistake here?\n\nWait, if θ=90°, the incline is vertical, so the car is in free fall. Therefore, the acceleration is g downward, so ay = -g, magnitude g. But according to our formula, ay = g*sin²θ, which when θ=90°, gives g. So that is correct. But for angles less than 90°, it's less than g. Therefore, in general, ay ≤ g. Similarly, ax when θ=90° is zero. For angles less than 90°, ax is positive. Therefore, for θ between 0 and 90°, ax is between 0 and g*(1/2) (maximum when θ=45°, sinθ*cosθ=0.5). Therefore, ax < g. So for all θ between 0 and 90°, ax < g and ay < g (except when θ=90°, where ay=g). But since θ is an incline, presumably it's less than 90°, so ay < g. Hence, option C is correct.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D says ax < g and ay = g. But we just saw that when θ=90°, ay = g, but for any incline less than 90°, ay < g. Since the problem says \"incline of angle θ\", which presumably is between 0 and 90°, not including 90°, so ay < g. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If we consider that the only vertical force is gravity, then why isn't the vertical acceleration equal to g? Because there is also a normal force acting on the car. The normal force has a vertical component as well. Let me try calculating the vertical acceleration using forces.\n\nThe forces on the car are gravity (mg downward) and the normal force (N perpendicular to the incline). Let's resolve these forces into vertical components.\n\nThe normal force is perpendicular to the incline, which is at angle θ from horizontal. Therefore, the normal force makes an angle θ with the vertical. Therefore, the vertical component of the normal force is N*cosθ upward. The vertical component of gravity is mg downward. The net vertical force is N*cosθ - mg. Then, the vertical acceleration ay = (N*cosθ - mg)/m.\n\nSimilarly, the horizontal component of the normal force is N*sinθ to the left (assuming the incline is rising to the right). The horizontal component of gravity is zero. Therefore, the net horizontal force is -N*sinθ, and horizontal acceleration ax = -N*sinθ/m.\n\nBut what is N? From the perpendicular to the incline direction, the normal force balances the component of gravity perpendicular to the incline. So N = mg*cosθ. Because the component of gravity perpendicular to the incline is mg*cosθ, and since there's no acceleration in that direction (assuming the car stays on the incline), N = mg*cosθ.\n\nTherefore, substituting N = mg*cosθ into the expressions for ax and ay:\n\nax = -N*sinθ/m = - (mg*cosθ)*sinθ/m = -g*sinθ*cosθ\n\nay = (N*cosθ - mg)/m = (mg*cosθ * cosθ - mg)/m = g*(cos²θ - 1)/1 = -g*sin²θ\n\nSo we get the same results as before. Therefore, ax = -g*sinθ*cosθ and ay = -g*sin²θ. Therefore, the magnitudes are |ax| = g*sinθ*cosθ and |ay| = g*sin²θ. Both are less than g, since sinθ*cosθ ≤ 1/2 and sin²θ ≤ 1 for all θ. Therefore, option C: ax < g and ay < g is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA: ax = 0; ay < g\n\nB: ax = 0; ay = g\n\nC: ax < g; ay < g\n\nD: ax < g; ay = g\n\nYes, so C is the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
