Let me think about the physics involved here. Hmm, starting from rest means the initial velocity is zero. The car is accelerating uniformly, so the acceleration is constant. The question is about time, distance, and acceleration. \n\nI remember there are some kinematic equations for uniformly accelerated motion. Let me recall them. The basic ones are:\n\n1. v = u + at\n2. s = ut + (1/2)at²\n3. v² = u² + 2as\n\nWhere:\n- v is the final velocity\n- u is the initial velocity\n- a is the acceleration\n- t is the time\n- s is the displacement\n\nSince we need to find the time (t) and we know the displacement (s), acceleration (a), and the initial velocity (u = 0 because it starts from rest), the second equation seems relevant here: s = ut + (1/2)at². \n\nLet me plug in the values. The initial velocity u is 0, so the first term ut becomes 0. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\ns = (1/2) * a * t²\n\nWe need to solve for t. Let me rearrange the formula. \n\nStarting with:\n\n200 m = 0.5 * 5 m/s² * t²\n\nFirst, calculate 0.5 * 5. That's 2.5. So:\n\n200 = 2.5 * t²\n\nTo solve for t², divide both sides by 2.5:\n\nt² = 200 / 2.5\n\nLet me compute that. 200 divided by 2.5. Hmm, 2.5 times 80 is 200, right? Because 2.5 * 80 = 200. So t² = 80.\n\nThen, take the square root of both sides to find t. The square root of 80. Let me calculate that. \n\nWell, sqrt(81) is 9, sqrt(64) is 8, so sqrt(80) is between 8.9 and 9. Let me compute it more accurately. \n\n80 is 16 * 5, so sqrt(16*5) = 4*sqrt(5). Since sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, so 4 * 2.236 ≈ 8.944. So t ≈ 8.944 seconds. \n\nLooking at the answer choices: A is 9.0 s, B is 10.5 s, C is 12.0 s, D is 15.5 s. So my calculation gives approximately 8.944 seconds, which is closest to option A, 9.0 s. \n\nWait, but let me check my math again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me redo the calculation step by step.\n\nGiven:\ns = 200 m\na = 5 m/s²\nu = 0 m/s\n\nEquation: s = ut + (1/2) a t²\n\nPlugging in:\n200 = 0 * t + 0.5 * 5 * t²\n200 = 0 + 2.5 t²\n2.5 t² = 200\nt² = 200 / 2.5\nt² = 80\nt = sqrt(80) ≈ 8.944 seconds\n\nYes, that's correct. So approximately 8.944 seconds, which rounds to 8.94 seconds. The answer options are given to one decimal place. So 8.94 is approximately 8.9 seconds, which is option A: 9.0 s. \n\nBut wait, 8.94 is closer to 8.9 than to 9.0? If the options are A:9.0, then maybe they expect rounding up? But 8.94 is 8.9 when rounded to one decimal place. Wait, 8.94 is 8.9 when rounded to one decimal place because the next digit is 4, which is less than 5. So it should be 8.9, but the option is 9.0. Hmm. Is there a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me check again.\n\n200 divided by 2.5. Let me do this division again. 2.5 times 80 is 200. So 200 divided by 2.5 is 80. Correct. So t squared is 80. Square root of 80 is indeed approximately 8.944. So why is option A 9.0? Maybe the question expects an exact value or there's a different approach?\n\nWait, perhaps I used the wrong formula? Let me check another formula to cross-verify. For example, using the first equation v = u + at. But we don't know v here. Alternatively, using the third equation: v² = u² + 2as. Maybe I can find the final velocity and then use that to find time?\n\nLet me try that. So v² = 0 + 2 * 5 * 200 = 2000. Therefore, v = sqrt(2000). Let me compute that. sqrt(2000) is sqrt(100*20) = 10*sqrt(20) ≈ 10*4.472 ≈ 44.72 m/s. Then, using v = u + at, so 44.72 = 0 + 5*t => t = 44.72 / 5 ≈ 8.944 seconds. Same result. So again, same answer. So 8.944 seconds. So why is the answer option A: 9.0 s? Maybe the question expects rounding to two significant figures? Wait, the given values: acceleration is 5 m/s², which is one significant figure? Wait, but 5 m/s² could be considered as one or maybe exact. The distance is 200 m, which is also possibly one or two or three significant figures depending on context. If 200 is considered as three significant figures, then the answer should be more precise. But since the options are given as decimals, maybe they just want approximate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the calculation. Let me check with another method. Let me compute t = sqrt(80). Let me compute sqrt(80):\n\nWe know that 8.9^2 = 79.21\n\n8.9^2 = (9 - 0.1)^2 = 81 - 2*9*0.1 + 0.1² = 81 - 1.8 + 0.01 = 79.21\n\nThen 8.9^2 = 79.21\n\nThen 8.94^2 = ?\n\nLet me compute 8.94^2:\n\nFirst, 8.9^2 is 79.21. Let me compute 8.94^2:\n\n(8.9 + 0.04)^2 = 8.9² + 2*8.9*0.04 + 0.04² = 79.21 + 0.712 + 0.0016 = 79.21 + 0.712 is 79.922 + 0.0016 ≈ 79.9236\n\nSo 8.94^2 ≈ 79.9236, which is still less than 80. The difference is 80 - 79.9236 = 0.0764.\n\nNow, let me try 8.94 + x, where x is small, such that (8.94 + x)^2 = 80.\n\nApproximate using linear approximation:\n\nLet f(x) = (8.94 + x)^2 ≈ 79.9236 + 2*8.94*x = 79.9236 + 17.88x\n\nSet equal to 80:\n\n79.9236 + 17.88x = 80\n\n17.88x = 0.0764\n\nx ≈ 0.0764 / 17.88 ≈ 0.00427 seconds.\n\nTherefore, t ≈ 8.94 + 0.00427 ≈ 8.9443 seconds. So approximately 8.944 seconds, which is about 8.94 seconds. So 8.94 seconds is the precise value. \n\nSo the answer is approximately 8.94 seconds. The options given are A:9.0 s, B:10.5 s, C:12.0 s, D:15.5 s. So the closest answer is A:9.0 s. Even though 8.94 is technically closer to 8.9 than to 9.0, depending on how it's rounded. If we round to one decimal place, 8.94 is 8.9. But if the question expects rounding to the nearest tenth, then 8.94 rounds to 8.9. However, the answer options don't have 8.9, they have 9.0. So maybe there's an error in the problem or in my calculation? Wait, let me check once more.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 200 divided by 2.5? Let me do that division again. 2.5 times 80 is 200. So 200 divided by 2.5 is indeed 80. So t squared is 80, so t is sqrt(80). Which is approximately 8.944. So that's correct. So perhaps the answer is supposed to be 9.0 s, and the question is rounded? Maybe the question expects us to use g = 10 or something? No, the acceleration is given as 5 m/s². \n\nAlternatively, maybe I used the wrong formula? Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula s = ut + 0.5*a*t² is correct for constant acceleration. Yes. Since initial velocity is zero, s = 0.5*a*t². Correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, maybe they meant deceleration? No, it says accelerating uniformly. So no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic? Let me check:\n\nIf a car accelerates at 5 m/s² for 9 seconds, starting from rest, how far does it go?\n\ns = 0.5 * 5 * 9² = 2.5 * 81 = 202.5 meters. Which is more than 200 meters. So at 9 seconds, the car would have gone 202.5 meters. Therefore, the time needed to reach 200 meters is less than 9 seconds. Since at 9 seconds it's already past 200 m. Therefore, the answer is less than 9 seconds. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, it's approximately 8.94 seconds. So if the options are A:9.0 s, which is slightly more than the actual time. But since at 9 seconds it has already covered more than 200 m, then the correct answer is less than 9 seconds. However, none of the options have 8.9 s. The closest is A:9.0 s. But perhaps in the options, they rounded up? Or maybe there's a miscalculation here?\n\nWait, let me check again. If t is 8.944 seconds, then the distance is 0.5 * 5 * (8.944)^2. Let me compute 8.944 squared. Well, we already know that 8.944 squared is approximately 80. So 0.5 * 5 * 80 = 0.5 * 400 = 200. Correct. So the exact value is sqrt(80) ≈ 8.944. So the answer is approximately 8.94 seconds. \n\nGiven the answer choices, the closest is A:9.0 s. However, depending on the context of the question, maybe they expect an exact fractional value? Let me check if sqrt(80) can be expressed as a fraction or something. But sqrt(80) is irrational. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the problem setup? \n\nWait, let me check if the acceleration was meant to be different? The problem says 5 m/s². The distance is 200 m. Maybe I should check with another approach. For example, average velocity. Since the car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly, the average velocity is (initial + final)/2. But we don't know the final velocity. However, since we know the acceleration and time, final velocity is a*t. Therefore, average velocity is (0 + a*t)/2 = (a*t)/2. Then, distance s = average velocity * time = (a*t)/2 * t = (1/2) a t². Which is the same equation as before. So again, same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use another formula or there's a typo in the options? Let me see. If I consider option B:10.5 s, let's check what distance that would give. \n\ns = 0.5 * 5 * (10.5)^2 = 2.5 * 110.25 = 275.625 m. Which is way more than 200. So no. Option C:12.0 s, s= 2.5*(144)= 360 m. D:15.5 s, s=2.5*(15.5)^2= 2.5*240.25=600.625 m. So all other options are way off. \n\nTherefore, only option A is close. However, since the exact answer is ~8.94 s, which is less than 9.0 s, but the options don't have a more precise choice. So maybe the question expects rounding to one decimal place, and 8.94 rounds to 8.9, but since there's no 8.9, maybe the answer is A:9.0? Or perhaps there was a mistake in creating the answer options? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me check once again. \n\nGiven:\n\ns = 200 m\n\na = 5 m/s²\n\nu = 0 m/s\n\nt = ?\n\nFormula: s = 0.5 * a * t²\n\nt = sqrt(2s / a) = sqrt( (2 * 200) / 5 ) = sqrt(400 / 5) = sqrt(80) ≈ 8.944 s. Yes. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 8.94 s, which is closest to option A:9.0 s. Given that in multiple-choice questions sometimes rounding is expected, and since 8.94 is very close to 9.0, maybe option A is the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using g = 10 m/s² for some reason, but no, the acceleration is given as 5 m/s². \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. \n\n\"How long would it take a car, starting from rest and accelerating uniformly in a straight line at 5 m/s², to cover a distance of 200 m?\"\n\nYes, that's what I used. So no, the numbers are correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A:9.0 s, even though strictly speaking it's approximately 8.94 s. Given the options, A is the closest. So I think the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
