So, there's a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder, all with the same mass. They're released from rest at the top of a short incline. The incline is really slick, so there's no friction, and the objects don't rotate—they just slide. The question is which one gets to the bottom first. The options are the sphere, cube, cylinder, or all at the same time.\n\nHmm. First, I remember that when objects are on an incline, their acceleration depends on the forces acting on them. Since there's no friction, I don't have to worry about rotational motion or different moments of inertia. Wait, the problem says they don't rotate, so it's pure sliding without rolling. That simplifies things because if they were rolling, their moments of inertia would affect their acceleration. But here, since they don't rotate, maybe they all accelerate the same?\n\nLet me recall Newton's laws. For an object sliding down a frictionless incline, the acceleration is determined by the component of gravity along the incline. The formula is a = g * sin(theta), where theta is the angle of the incline. This formula is usually derived for a block sliding down, but does it apply to other shapes if they are sliding without rotating?\n\nSince all three objects have the same mass and the incline is frictionless, the only force causing acceleration is the component of their weight along the incline. The mass cancels out in the equation, so regardless of the object's shape, as long as they are sliding without friction, they should all have the same acceleration. Therefore, they should all reach the bottom at the same time.\n\nWait, but why are the different shapes mentioned? In other problems where objects roll without slipping, their moments of inertia affect their acceleration. For example, a solid sphere, a cylinder, and a hoop would have different accelerations because their moments of inertia are different. But in this case, since there's no rotation, the moment of inertia doesn't come into play. The problem states that the objects do not rotate when released but slide instead. So the shape shouldn't matter here.\n\nBut let me double-check. If they are sliding, the only factor affecting acceleration is the gravitational component. Since they all have the same mass, and mass cancels out in F=ma, the acceleration is the same. So the cube, sphere, and cylinder would all have the same acceleration and start from rest, so they would reach the bottom simultaneously. Therefore, the answer should be D: All reach the base at the same time.\n\nBut wait, could there be any other factors? For example, the sphere might have a different contact area, but since the surface is frictionless, contact area doesn't matter. In reality, friction can depend on contact area, but since there's no friction here, it's irrelevant. Also, air resistance isn't mentioned, so we can assume it's negligible. The problem states \"short incline,\" so maybe the time is too short for air resistance to have an effect anyway. But since all objects are same mass and presumably similar size (assuming they are of similar dimensions to have equal mass?), but the problem doesn't specify their sizes. Wait, the problem says they have equal mass, but doesn't say they have the same volume or radius or side length. However, since the incline is the same for all, and they are sliding without rotation, their mass distribution doesn't affect the acceleration because there's no rotation. So regardless of their shape, as long as they slide without friction, they should all accelerate at the same rate. Therefore, they all reach the bottom at the same time. So the answer is D.\n\nBut let me think again. For example, if they were rolling, the sphere would have a lower moment of inertia compared to a cylinder or cube (assuming cube can't roll). But since they are sliding, no rotation, so no rotational kinetic energy. So all potential energy is converted to translational kinetic energy. But since they are released from rest and slide down, their acceleration is only determined by gravity component. So same acceleration, same time. So D is correct. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>"}
