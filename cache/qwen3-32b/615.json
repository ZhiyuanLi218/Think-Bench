Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the license plate has two parts: letters and numbers. The letters come first, then the numbers. Each part has specific requirements: the letters must be different from each other, and the digits must also be different from each other. Let me tackle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with the letters. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, from A to Z. The license plate requires two different letters. So, for the first letter, I can choose any of the 26 letters. But once I've chosen the first letter, the second letter has to be different. That means for the second letter, there are only 25 letters left to choose from. \n\nWait, so does that mean the number of possible combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25? Let me think. If I have 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second, then yes, multiplying them gives the total number of two-letter combinations where the letters are different. For example, if the first letter is A, the second can be B, C, ..., Z. If the first letter is B, the second can be A, C, D,...Z, and so on. So, 26*25 makes sense here. Let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose there are 3 letters (A, B, C) and we want two different letters. Then the combinations would be AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB. That's 6 combinations, which is 3*2=6. Yep, that works. So applying the same logic, 26*25 should be correct for the letters part.\n\nNow moving on to the numbers. The problem states that there are two different one-digit numbers. One-digit numbers are from 0 to 9, so there are 10 possible digits. Again, similar to the letters, the first digit can be any of the 10 digits, and the second digit has to be different from the first. Therefore, for the first digit, 10 choices, and for the second digit, 9 choices. Multiplying them together, 10*9, gives the number of possible two-digit combinations with different digits.\n\nLet me check with a smaller example again. Suppose digits are from 0 to 1 (so two digits) and we want two different digits. Then possible combinations would be 01 and 10. That's 2 combinations, which is 2*1=2. If digits are 0-2, then combinations are 01, 02, 10, 12, 20, 21. That's 6, which is 3*2=6. So yes, the formula holds. Therefore, for digits 0-9, it's 10*9=90.\n\nNow, to find the total number of license plates, I need to combine the number of possibilities for the letters and the numbers. Since each part is independent (the choice of letters doesn't affect the choice of numbers and vice versa), I can multiply the two results together.\n\nSo total license plates = (number of letter combinations) * (number of digit combinations) = (26*25) * (10*9). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 26*25. Let me do 26*25. Well, 25*26. 25*20 is 500, and 25*6 is 150, so 500+150=650. So 26*25=650.\n\nThen 10*9=90. So total is 650*90. Let me compute that. 650*90. Breaking it down: 600*90 + 50*90. 600*90 is 54,000. 50*90 is 4,500. Adding them together, 54,000 + 4,500 = 58,500. So total license plates would be 58,500.\n\nWait, let me confirm that multiplication again. Alternatively, 650*90. Since 65*9 = 585, then adding two zeros (because 650 is 65*10 and 90 is 9*10), so 585*10*10=58,500. Yep, that's the same. So that seems right.\n\nBut let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in the initial assumptions. So letters are two different letters, digits are two different digits. The problem says \"2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers.\" So yes, that seems to be exactly what I calculated.\n\nWait, but hold on. Are the letters case-sensitive? The problem says \"letters (A through Z)\", so I think it's uppercase only, and typically license plates are case-insensitive or only use one case. Since it's not mentioned, we can assume that it's just uppercase, so 26 letters. So no problem there. Also, the problem says \"different letters\", so no repetition. Same with numbers, different digits, no repetition.\n\nAnother thing to check: is the order important? For example, is AB different from BA? Yes, because license plates are ordered. So AB12 is different from BA12. Therefore, using permutations is correct here, not combinations. Because in permutations, order matters. Since we calculated 26*25, which is permutations of 26 letters taken 2 at a time, and 10*9, permutations of 10 digits taken 2 at a time, that is correct.\n\nIf it were combinations, it would be C(26,2) and C(10,2), but since order matters in license plates, permutations are the right approach. Let me verify with numbers. For example, if you have two letters, the combination count would be 26*25 / 2! = 325, but since AB and BA are different plates, we need to use permutations, which is 650. So yes, multiplying 26*25 is correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying permutations for letters and permutations for digits gives the total number of license plates. Therefore, 650 * 90 = 58,500.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose someone might think that letters can repeat? But the problem says \"2 different letters\", so repetition is not allowed. Similarly for digits. So no, repetition is not allowed here.\n\nAnother possible mistake: confusing digits with numbers. The problem says \"2 different one digit (0-9) numbers\". Wait, does that mean two different numbers, each being a one-digit number? Which is what I assumed. So each of the two numbers is a single digit, and they have to be different. So yes, 10 choices for the first, 9 for the second. So 10*9.\n\nAlternatively, if it had said \"a two-digit number\", but it says \"2 different one digit numbers\". So two separate digits. So yeah, that's two digits, each one being a single digit number, different from each other. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. So 26*25*10*9 = 58,500.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's compute permutations.\n\nThe number of permutations of 26 letters taken 2 at a time is P(26,2) = 26! / (26-2)! = 26! / 24! = 26*25*24! / 24! = 26*25 = 650. Same as before.\n\nSimilarly, permutations of 10 digits taken 2 at a time is P(10,2) = 10! / (10-2)! = 10! / 8! = 10*9*8! / 8! = 10*9 = 90. Same as before.\n\nMultiply them together: 650 * 90. As before, 58,500. So that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 58,500 different license plates.\n\nBut let me think again if there's another angle. For example, sometimes license plates can have letters and numbers in different positions or with different rules, but in this problem, it's explicitly stated: 2 different letters followed by 2 different digits. So the format is LL NN, where L is letter, N is number, each with no repetition.\n\nTherefore, no other factors to consider. So the total number is indeed 26*25*10*9 = 58,500.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 26*25 first:\n\n26*25: 25*26. Well 25*26 is 650. Correct.\n\nThen 10*9 is 90. Then 650*90. Let me compute 650*90:\n\nFirst, 650*9 = 5,850. Then times 10 is 58,500. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 58,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of possible license plates is \\boxed{58500}.\n</think>"}
