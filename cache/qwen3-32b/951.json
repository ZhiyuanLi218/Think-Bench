Then I have to find the sum of all possible values of N. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the three positive integers as a, b, and c. The problem states two main conditions:\n\n1. The product N = a * b * c is equal to 6 times their sum, so:\n   N = 6(a + b + c)\n\n2. One of the integers is the sum of the other two. Without loss of generality, let's assume that c = a + b. (I can check later if there are other possibilities by permuting the variables.)\n\nSo substituting c = a + b into the first equation, we get:\nN = a * b * (a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 6(2a + 2b) = 12(a + b)\n\nTherefore, we have:\na * b * (a + b) = 12(a + b)\n\nSince a, b, and c are positive integers, a + b is not zero, so we can divide both sides of the equation by (a + b):\n\na * b = 12\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding all pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that a * b = 12, and then computing N for each case. However, we also need to ensure that the third integer c = a + b is a positive integer, which it will be since a and b are positive integers.\n\nLet me list all the positive integer pairs (a, b) where a ≤ b and a * b = 12:\n\n1. (1, 12)\n2. (2, 6)\n3. (3, 4)\n\nThese are the factor pairs of 12. Since we assumed c = a + b, we can compute c for each pair:\n\n1. For (1, 12): c = 1 + 12 = 13\n2. For (2, 6): c = 2 + 6 = 8\n3. For (3, 4): c = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nNow, let's compute N for each case:\n\n1. N = 1 * 12 * 13 = 156\n2. N = 2 * 6 * 8 = 96\n3. N = 3 * 4 * 7 = 84\n\nSo, the possible values of N are 156, 96, and 84. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of N is 156 + 96 + 84. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 156 + 96 = 252\n\nThen, 252 + 84 = 336\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there are other possibilities where instead of c = a + b, maybe a = b + c or b = a + c. Since the problem says \"one of the integers is the sum of the other two,\" I assumed c was that one, but maybe there are other cases where a different variable is the sum. However, due to the symmetry of the problem, these cases should be covered by permutations of a, b, c. For example, if instead a = b + c, then we would have similar equations. Let me check if considering different variables as the sum gives any new solutions.\n\nLet me suppose that instead of c = a + b, we have a = b + c. Let's try that.\n\nSo, suppose a = b + c. Then substituting into N = a * b * c = 6(a + b + c):\n\nFirst, a + b + c = (b + c) + b + c = 2b + 2c = 2(b + c)\n\nSo N = 6 * 2(b + c) = 12(b + c)\n\nBut also N = a * b * c = (b + c) * b * c\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n(b + c) * b * c = 12(b + c)\n\nAgain, since b + c ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by (b + c):\n\nb * c = 12\n\nSo this is exactly the same equation as before. Therefore, regardless of which variable is the sum of the other two, we end up with the product of the other two variables being 12. Therefore, the possible pairs (b, c) are again (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4), leading to a = 13, 8, 7 respectively. Then N would be 1 * 12 * 13, 2 * 6 * 8, 3 * 4 * 7, same as before. Therefore, even if we consider different variables being the sum, we get the same set of N values. Therefore, there are no additional solutions.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other factor pairs if we don't restrict to a ≤ b. For example, (1, 12), (12, 1), (2, 6), (6, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3). However, since multiplication is commutative, these would lead to the same values of N. For example, (12, 1) would give c = 13, same as (1, 12). Therefore, N is still 1*12*13, same as before. So no new N values.\n\nTherefore, the possible N values are 156, 96, and 84, and their sum is 336. Wait, but let me check if there are any constraints that I might have missed. For example, are all the integers positive? Yes, since we are considering positive integers. Also, the problem says \"three positive integers,\" so that's satisfied.\n\nBut let me verify each case to make sure that they actually satisfy the original equation N = 6(a + b + c):\n\nFirst case: a=1, b=12, c=13. Then N=1*12*13=156. The sum is 1+12+13=26. 6 times the sum is 6*26=156. Correct.\n\nSecond case: a=2, b=6, c=8. N=2*6*8=96. Sum is 2+6+8=16. 6*16=96. Correct.\n\nThird case: a=3, b=4, c=7. N=3*4*7=84. Sum is 3+4+7=14. 6*14=84. Correct.\n\nSo all three cases check out. Therefore, the possible Ns are indeed 156, 96, 84. Sum is 156 + 96 + 84 = 336. Wait, but let me check again the addition:\n\n156 + 96: 156 + 96. 156 + 90 = 246, 246 + 6 = 252. Then 252 + 84: 252 + 80 = 332, 332 + 4 = 336. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut hold on, I have a feeling that maybe there is another solution. Let me think again. Are there other factor pairs for 12? Well, 12 can also be expressed as 4 * 3, 6 * 2, 12 * 1, but we already considered those. What about if one of the numbers is larger? Wait, but we derived that a*b=12, so given that a and b are positive integers, there are only those three unique pairs. Therefore, no other possibilities.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose that the three integers are not distinct? For example, could there be a case where two numbers are same? For example, if a = b, then c = 2a. Then, a * a * 2a = 2a^3. And 6(a + a + 2a) = 6*4a = 24a. Therefore, 2a^3 = 24a => 2a^3 -24a = 0 => 2a(a^2 - 12) = 0. Since a is positive integer, a^2 = 12 => a = sqrt(12), which is not integer. Therefore, no solution here. So no solutions with two numbers equal.\n\nAlternatively, if all three numbers are same? Then, c = a + b, but if all three are same, then c = a + b = 2a, so a = 2a => a = 0, which is invalid. So no solution there.\n\nTherefore, no other solutions from equal numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where the numbers are not in the factor pairs? Wait, but we derived that if one number is the sum of the other two, then the product of the other two numbers must be 12. Therefore, unless there's a mistake in that derivation, there are no other solutions.\n\nLet me check the derivation again. Starting from N = a*b*c = 6(a + b + c), with c = a + b. Then substituting:\n\na*b*(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) => a*b*(a + b) = 6(2a + 2b) = 12(a + b). Then dividing both sides by (a + b) gives a*b = 12. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, as long as a + b ≠ 0, which it isn't because a and b are positive integers. Therefore, that derivation is correct. Therefore, only possible when a*b=12, so the factor pairs are limited as above.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 156 + 96 + 84 = 336. However, wait, let me check if maybe there are other possibilities where the equation could hold if we don't assume that c = a + b but instead consider that maybe two different variables could be expressed as sums? Wait, but in three variables, if one is the sum of the other two, there are three possibilities: a = b + c, b = a + c, or c = a + b. However, in each case, we end up with similar equations. However, in each case, the product of the other two variables equals 12. Therefore, we have considered all possibilities by taking c = a + b and considering all factor pairs for a*b=12. Therefore, there are no other solutions.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other triples where one of the numbers is the sum of the other two, but the product is 12 for different variables. For example, suppose in the case where a = b + c, then b*c = 12. So if we take (b, c) as (1, 12), then a = 13, same as before, leading to N = 1*12*13. Similarly, if (b, c) is (2, 6), then a = 8, leading to N = 2*6*8. Similarly for (3, 4). So same N values. Therefore, regardless of which variable is the sum, we get same N. Therefore, no new Ns.\n\nTherefore, the three Ns are unique? Wait, 156, 96, 84. Are these all distinct? Yes. So adding them up gives 336.\n\nBut let me check again if there are any other factor pairs if we consider 12 as a product of more than two numbers? Wait, no, because in our derivation we have a*b=12, so only two numbers. Therefore, the factor pairs are only those three. Therefore, I think that's all.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose someone says, what if a=4, b=3, then c=7, which is same as one of our cases. Similarly, if a=1, b=12, c=13. So all cases covered.\n\nWait, but just to be 100% sure, let me check if there are other ways to get a*b=12 with positive integers. For example, if a or b is greater than 12? For example, a=12, b=1, which we have. If a=24, then b=0.5, but b must be positive integer, so no. Similarly, negative numbers? No, since they have to be positive. Therefore, only the three pairs.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 336.\n\nWait, but I vaguely recall that in some similar problems, sometimes there are more solutions. Let me think again. Suppose that maybe the variables are not in the order I considered? For example, if in the case where a=1, b=12, c=13, but what if there is another triple where one of the numbers is the sum but not in the way we considered? Wait, no, because we already considered all possibilities by saying that if any one variable is the sum of the other two, then the product of those two is 12, so all possibilities are covered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a case where more than one of the variables is the sum of the other two? For example, if all three numbers are zero? No, they have to be positive integers. Or if two of them are sums? For example, if a = b + c and b = a + c? Let's see: If a = b + c and b = a + c, substituting the first into the second gives b = (b + c) + c => b = b + 2c => 0 = 2c => c=0, which is invalid. Similarly, other combinations would lead to contradictions or zeros, which are invalid. Therefore, only one of the variables can be the sum of the other two. Therefore, no overlap.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct. The sum of all possible N is 336.\n\nBut let me check online if this problem is known. Wait, no, I shouldn't do that. Since this is a problem-solving scenario, I need to rely on my own calculations. However, just to be thorough, let me check once again if there are other factor pairs.\n\nFactors of 12:\n\n1 and 12\n\n2 and 6\n\n3 and 4\n\n4 and 3\n\n6 and 2\n\n12 and 1\n\nSo those are all. So when considering unordered pairs, there are three unique ones. Therefore, three solutions. Therefore, three Ns. Therefore, adding them gives 336. Therefore, I think that is the answer.\n\nBut let me check once again with another approach. Suppose we let variables be x, y, z, with z = x + y. Then, xyz = 6(x + y + z). Then, substituting z:\n\nxy(x + y) = 6(x + y + x + y) => xy(x + y) = 6(2x + 2y) => xy(x + y) = 12(x + y). Then cancelling x + y:\n\nxy = 12. Therefore, same result. Therefore, no other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we didn't assume which variable is the sum. Let me think. Let me consider all possibilities. Let me suppose that the three numbers are a, b, c, with one of them being the sum. Let me think of all possible triples where one is the sum of the other two and their product is 6 times their sum. But since we have shown that regardless of which variable is the sum, we get that the product of the other two is 12, so all such triples are generated by taking two numbers multiplying to 12 and the third being their sum. Therefore, the set of all such triples is exactly those generated by the factor pairs of 12. Therefore, no more, no less. Therefore, the possible Ns are as calculated.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 336.\n\nWait, but let me check another thing. Suppose that the three numbers are 6, 6, and 12. Let me check if this satisfies the conditions. Is one of them the sum of the other two? 6 + 6 = 12, yes. Then product N = 6*6*12 = 432. Sum is 6 + 6 + 12 = 24. 6 times the sum is 144. 432 ≠ 144. Therefore, this does not satisfy the condition. But according to our previous logic, since one of them is the sum of the other two, then the product of the other two should be 12. Here, the other two are 6 and 6, product is 36 ≠ 12. Therefore, this is not a solution. Therefore, our derivation was correct. Because in our derivation, we said that if one is the sum, then the product of the other two is 12. Therefore, in this case, since 6*6 ≠ 12, it is not a solution. Therefore, our logic holds.\n\nAnother example: Let's take numbers 2, 2, 4. Then, product is 16. Sum is 8. 6 times sum is 48 ≠ 16. Also, product of the other two is 2*2 = 4 ≠ 12, so not a solution. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Let me take numbers 1, 3, 4. Since 1 + 3 = 4. Then product N = 1*3*4 = 12. Sum is 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. 6 times sum is 48 ≠ 12. Therefore, not a solution. According to our logic, product of the two smaller numbers should be 12. Here, 1*3 = 3 ≠ 12. Therefore, not a solution. Correct.\n\nTherefore, our logic seems sound.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 336. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of N is 336.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{336}\n</think>"}
