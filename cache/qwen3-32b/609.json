Assuming the thiocarbonate ion (CS₃²⁻) has the following oxidation states:\n\n- Carbon: +4  \n- Each sulfur: -2/3 (since 3 sulfur atoms contribute to -2 overall)\n\nHowever, this is not a standard oxidation state for sulfur, and more accurately, sulfur is typically -2 in such anions. If each sulfur is -2, then:\n\n$$\n\\text{Carbon} + 3 \\times (-2) = -2 \\Rightarrow \\text{Carbon} = +4\n$$\n\nIn this case, sulfur is in a -2 oxidation state, which is typically reducible but can be **oxidized** in certain conditions (e.g., to +4 or +6 oxidation states). Since sulfur can be oxidized, the entire compound can also be oxidized. Therefore, **Na₂CS₃ can be oxidized**, and **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: \"Na₂CS₃ solution is alkaline\"**\n\nSodium thiocarbonate is a salt of a **strong base** (Na⁺) and a **weak acid** (the corresponding acid of CS₃²⁻ would be H₂CS₃, a weak acid, analogous to H₂CO₃ for carbonates). \n\nSalts of strong bases and weak acids typically **hydrolyze** in water to form **basic** (alkaline) solutions. For example, sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) is basic due to the hydrolysis of the carbonate ion.\n\nGiven this analogy, the thiocarbonate ion (CS₃²⁻) is likely to hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻, making the solution **alkaline**.\n\n$$\n\\text{CS}_3^{2-} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{HCS}_3^- + \\text{OH}^-\n$$\n\nHence, **Option B is correct**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: \"This preparation reaction is an entropy-decreasing process\"**\n\nTo determine the entropy change (ΔS), we analyze the phases of the reactants and products:\n\n- **Reactants**: 2 moles of solid (NaHS), 1 mole of liquid (CS₂)\n- **Products**: 1 mole of solid (Na₂CS₃), 1 mole of gas (H₂S)\n\nThe most significant change is the **formation of a gas** from non-gaseous reactants. Gases have much higher entropy than solids or liquids.

The question is about sodium thiocarbonate (Na₂CS₃) and its preparation, as well as some properties related to the reaction and the compounds involved. The options given are A to D, and I need to determine which statements are correct.\n\nFirst, let me recall what I know about the reaction provided:\n\n2 NaHS (solid) + CS₂ (liquid) → Na₂CS₃ (solid) + H₂S (gas)\n\nThe question asks which of the four statements (A-D) are correct.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Na₂CS₃ cannot be oxidized.\n\nHmm. Sodium thiocarbonate... I need to think about its chemical properties. Thiocarbonates are similar to carbonates but with sulfur replacing one of the oxygen atoms. In carbonates (CO₃²⁻), the carbon is in a +4 oxidation state. In thiocarbonate (CS₃²⁻), the sulfur atoms would have different oxidation states. Let me calculate the oxidation state of carbon here. \n\nIn CS₃²⁻, the overall charge is -2. Let’s assume each sulfur is in -2 oxidation state. Let me check. Carbon's oxidation state would be x + 3*(-2) = -2 → x - 6 = -2 → x = +4. Wait, that's the same as in carbonate. But thiocarbonate has sulfur instead of oxygen. However, sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so maybe the oxidation states are different? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nActually, in thiocarbonate ions, the structure is different. The thiocarbonate ion (CS₃²⁻) is similar to carbonate but with a sulfur atom replacing one oxygen. Wait, but in the formula given here, it's CS₃²⁻, so three sulfur atoms. Carbonate is CO₃²⁻. If we replace one oxygen with sulfur, we get COS₂²⁻? Or maybe the structure is different. Wait, maybe the actual structure of Na₂CS₃ is different. Maybe it's a different arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the oxidation state of carbon in CS₃²⁻ is different. Let me recalculate. If the ion is CS₃²⁻, and assuming each sulfur is -2, then carbon's oxidation state would be:\n\nx + 3*(-2) = -2 → x = +4. So same as carbonate. So carbon is in +4 oxidation state here. \n\nNow, can Na₂CS₃ be oxidized? If carbon is in +4, which is its maximum oxidation state (since carbon can go up to +4, like in CO₂), then maybe it can't be oxidized further. However, sulfur in the compound is in -2 oxidation state (assuming that). Wait, but sulfur can have various oxidation states. However, if the thiocarbonate ion is CS₃²⁻, and each sulfur is -2, then the carbon is +4. If the thiocarbonate can be oxidized, perhaps the sulfur can be oxidized. For example, if sulfur is in -2, it can be oxidized to higher oxidation states like +4 or +6. So maybe Na₂CS₃ can be oxidized, depending on the conditions. \n\nTherefore, statement A says it cannot be oxidized. But if sulfur is in -2, then it can be oxidized. So A might be incorrect. But I need to verify if the oxidation states are correct. Maybe my assumption that sulfur is -2 is wrong here. \n\nWait, in thio compounds, sometimes sulfur can have different oxidation states. For example, in thiosulfate (S₂O₃²⁻), the oxidation states are different. Let me think. In thiosulfate, the central sulfur is in +2 oxidation state, while the terminal sulfurs are -1. But thiocarbonate might have a different structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in CS₃²⁻, the carbon is +4 and each sulfur is -2/3? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The total charge is -2. Let me do the math again. If the formula is CS₃²⁻, then the total charge is -2. Let me assume that each sulfur is in -2 oxidation state. Then:\n\nCarbon's oxidation state + 3*(-2) = -2 → Carbon's oxidation state is +4. So same as in carbonate. So if the sulfur is in -2, then it's possible for it to be oxidized. Therefore, Na₂CS₃ can be oxidized, so statement A is incorrect. So A is not correct. \n\nOption B: Na₂CS₃ solution is alkaline.\n\nSodium thiocarbonate. If it's dissolved in water, what would happen? Let's think about its hydrolysis. Thiocarbonates can hydrolyze in water. Let me recall. For example, sodium thiosulfate (Na₂S₂O₃) is a known compound that can hydrolyze. Thiocarbonates might behave similarly. \n\nIf Na₂CS₃ is dissolved in water, perhaps it hydrolyzes. Let me try to write a possible hydrolysis reaction. Assuming that in water, the thiocarbonate ion (CS₃²⁻) reacts with water. \n\nCS₃²⁻ + H₂O → ?\n\nIn thiosulfate hydrolysis, S₂O₃²⁻ + H₂O → S + SO₃²⁻ + 2H⁺ or something like that. But for thiocarbonate, maybe similar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's similar to carbonate hydrolysis. Carbonate ions hydrolyze to produce OH⁻, making the solution alkaline. If thiocarbonate is similar, maybe it also hydrolyzes to produce OH⁻, making the solution alkaline. \n\nBut wait, thiocarbonate has sulfur instead of oxygen. Sulfur is less electronegative, so maybe the hydrolysis is different. Let me think. If the thiocarbonate ion is a weak base, then its solution would be alkaline. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis of CS₃²⁻ produces H₂S or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sodium salt of a weak acid would hydrolyze. Let me think about the acidity/basicity of the thiocarbonate ion. \n\nIf the parent acid of CS₃²⁻ is H₂CS₃. What's the strength of this acid? If H₂CS₃ is a weak acid, then its sodium salt would hydrolyze to produce OH⁻, making the solution alkaline. \n\nBut I don't know much about H₂CS₃. Let me try to think. Carbon disulfide (CS₂) is a neutral molecule. Thiocarbonic acid... I'm not sure if it exists. Maybe the thiocarbonate is more stable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe when Na₂CS₃ is dissolved in water, it reacts with water to form H₂S and some other products. For example:\n\nCS₃²⁻ + H₂O → H₂S + ... ?\n\nBut I need to balance it. Let me try:\n\nSuppose CS₃²⁻ + H₂O → H₂S + ... \n\nCarbon is +4 in CS₃²⁻. If it forms H₂S, sulfur would be -2. So maybe some redox reaction here. Alternatively, maybe the thiocarbonate ion is a weak base. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, considering that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is a strong base? Wait, NaHS is the sodium salt of hydrosulfuric acid (H₂S), which is a weak acid. So NaHS would hydrolyze to give a basic solution. \n\nBut Na₂CS₃ is a different compound. Let me think about its possible hydrolysis. If the thiocarbonate ion is a conjugate base of a weak acid, then it would hydrolyze to produce OH⁻. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution is not alkaline. But given that sodium salts of weak acids tend to be basic, if the corresponding acid is weak, then the salt would be basic. \n\nBut I don't know the exact strength of the acid. However, considering that CS₂ is a neutral molecule, and if the thiocarbonate is derived from a weak acid, then maybe the solution is alkaline. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the thiocarbonate ion is a stronger base than carbonate. But without specific data, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the reaction given. The reaction produces H₂S gas. H₂S is a weak acid. If the product is H₂S, then maybe the reaction is producing a weak acid, and the other product is Na₂CS₃. If the sodium thiocarbonate is a salt of a weak acid, then its solution would be basic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sodium thiocarbonate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base (since Na is from a strong base, NaOH). Therefore, the solution would be alkaline. \n\nSo perhaps statement B is correct. \n\nOption C: This preparation reaction is an entropy-decreasing process.\n\nThe reaction is 2 NaHS (solid) + CS₂ (liquid) → Na₂CS₃ (solid) + H₂S (gas)\n\nTo determine if the entropy decreases, we need to look at the change in the number of moles of gas and the phases of the substances. \n\nEntropy tends to increase when going from solid/liquid to gas, and when the number of moles of gas increases. \n\nIn the reactants, we have 2 moles of solid NaHS and 1 mole of liquid CS₂. In the products, we have 1 mole of solid Na₂CS₃ and 1 mole of gaseous H₂S. \n\nSo the reactants have no gas, and the products have 1 mole of gas. So the entropy increases because gas is produced. Therefore, the entropy change (ΔS) is positive. \n\nBut the question is whether the process is entropy-decreasing, i.e., ΔS < 0. If the entropy increases, then the statement C is incorrect. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to consider. Let me count the number of moles of gas. On the reactant side: 0 moles of gas. On the product side: 1 mole of gas. So the number of gas moles increases by 1, which is a large positive contribution to entropy. \n\nAdditionally, the solids and liquids: we have 2 moles of solid NaHS and 1 mole of liquid CS₂ turning into 1 mole of solid Na₂CS₃. The number of solid moles decreases from 2 to 1, which would contribute to a decrease in entropy (since solids are more ordered). But the formation of a gas would have a much larger effect. \n\nSo overall, the entropy change is positive. Therefore, the process is entropy-increasing, so statement C is incorrect. \n\nOption D: The thermal stability of CS₂ is higher than that of CO₂.\n\nThermal stability refers to how stable a compound is at high temperatures. Which is more stable, carbon disulfide (CS₂) or carbon dioxide (CO₂)?\n\nI know that CO₂ is a very stable compound, being a major component of the atmosphere and not easily decomposed. CS₂, on the other hand, is more reactive. For example, CS₂ can react with oxygen to form CO₂ and SO₂:\n\nCS₂ + 3 O₂ → CO₂ + 2 SO₂\n\nThis reaction is exothermic and occurs readily, indicating that CS₂ is less thermally stable than CO₂. \n\nTherefore, CO₂ is more thermally stable than CS₂. Hence, statement D is correct because it says CS₂'s thermal stability is higher than CO₂'s, which is false. Wait, no. Wait the statement says \"The thermal stability of CS₂ is higher than that of CO₂.\" If CO₂ is more stable, then CS₂ is less stable. Therefore, the statement D is incorrect. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Thermal stability can depend on the decomposition reactions. For example, if CS₂ decomposes more readily upon heating than CO₂, then CO₂ is more stable. \n\nCarbon dioxide is a very stable molecule due to the strong double bonds between carbon and oxygen. Carbon disulfide has double bonds as well, but sulfur is larger and bonds are weaker. Therefore, CS₂ is less thermally stable than CO₂. Therefore, statement D is incorrect because it claims CS₂ is more stable, which is not true. \n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nA: Incorrect (Na₂CS₃ can be oxidized)\n\nB: Correct (solution is alkaline)\n\nC: Incorrect (entropy increases)\n\nD: Incorrect (CO₂ is more stable)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check again. \n\nFor option B, I need to confirm whether the solution is indeed alkaline. Since Na₂CS₃ is a salt of a strong base (NaOH) and a weak acid (assuming that the corresponding acid of CS₃²⁻ is weak), then yes, the solution would be alkaline. \n\nAlternatively, if the corresponding acid is strong, then the solution would be neutral or acidic. But how do I know?\n\nLet me think about the analogous case. For example, sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) is basic because CO₃²⁻ is the conjugate base of a weak acid (HCO₃⁻). Similarly, if CS₃²⁻ is the conjugate base of a weak acid, then its solution would be basic. \n\nAssuming that the parent acid of CS₃²⁻ is something like H₂CS₃, which is probably a weak acid (since H₂S is a weak acid and CS₂ is a neutral molecule), then the salt would hydrolyze to produce OH⁻. \n\nTherefore, B is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \n\nBut wait, the options are (A)-(D), and the question says \"the following statements are correct\". So if only B is correct, then the answer is B. \n\nBut let me check once more for any possible mistakes. \n\nFor option D: thermal stability. Carbon dioxide is more stable than carbon disulfide. Therefore, statement D is incorrect. \n\nFor option C: the reaction produces a gas, so entropy increases. Therefore, the process is entropy-increasing, so statement C (entropy-decreasing) is wrong. \n\nTherefore, only B is correct. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
