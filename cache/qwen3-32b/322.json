{"question":"Potassium Hydrogen Tartrate is quite insoluble in water, but readily dissolves in both acid and base.  Why is this potassium salt so insoluble while the full double acid and full double salt are very water soluble? How could this be experimentally verified? A:Only D or L hydrogen tartrate is able to chelate the potassium ion in such as way that it precipitates.  Comparably, the solubility of meso potassium hydrogen tartrate should be much higher than either D or L. B:The way the single salt chelates the potassium ion as to fill all of the coordination sites in such a way that the neutral complex is a self-contained unit. The addition of methyl chloride would make methyl ethers from the alcohols that would not coordinate the same way. C:The way the single salt chelates the potassium ion as to fill all of the coordination sites in such a way that the neutral complex is a self-contained unit.  Oxidation of the alcohols to ketones would change the geometry of carbons 2 and 3 to sp2, thereby preventing the correct chelation.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and experimental verification:\n\n---\n\n### **Why is potassium hydrogen tartrate insoluble?**\n- **Chelation mechanism**: The hydrogen tartrate ion (HC₄H₄O₆⁻) contains two adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups on its central carbon atoms (C2 and C3). These hydroxyl groups can coordinate with potassium ions (K⁺) to form a **neutral, self-contained chelated complex**. This complex is stable and does not dissociate into ions in water, leading to low solubility.\n- **Contrast with full salts**: The full double salt (K₂C₄H₄O₆) and the full double acid (H₂C₄H₄O₆) lack this chelation. Instead, they dissociate into ions (e.g., 2 K⁺ + C₄H₄O₆²⁻ or 2 H⁺ + C₄H₄O₆²⁻), which interact strongly with water, enhancing solubility.\n\n---\n\n### **Experimental Verification**\nTo verify the role of hydroxyl groups in chelation, the **hydroxyls must be chemically modified** to prevent their interaction with potassium ions. This would disrupt the chelated complex, increasing solubility if the hypothesis is correct.\n\n- **Option D** is the correct choice:\n  - **Mechanism**: Acetone forms a **ketal** with the hydroxyl groups of hydrogen tartrate. This converts the hydroxyls into a non-coordinating acetal (ketal) group, preventing them from chelating potassium ions.\n  - **Result**: The modified compound (with ketal groups) would no longer form a stable chelated complex, leading to increased solubility in water. This directly supports the hypothesis that chelation is the reason for the original low solubility.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect**\n- **Option A**: While chirality (D/L vs. meso) affects molecular symmetry, it does not directly explain the solubility difference. The key factor is the ability of hydroxyl groups to chelate potassium, not the stereochemistry of the molecule.\n- **Option B**: Methyl chloride is not a typical reagent for methylating hydroxyl groups. More common reagents (e.g., methyl iodide) would be required, and the method is less practical compared to ketal formation.\n- **Option C**: Oxidizing hydroxyls to ketones would alter the geometry of the molecule (from sp³ to sp²), but this process is less straightforward and less selective than ketal formation. It also risks over-oxidizing the molecule, complicating the interpretation of results.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe correct answer is **D**. By forming a ketal with acetone, the hydroxyl groups are blocked from chelating potassium ions. If this increases solubility, it confirms that the chelated complex is responsible for the low solubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate. This experimental approach directly tests the hypothesis and aligns with the structural and chemical principles involved. \n\n**Answer: D**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about why potassium hydrogen tartrate is insoluble in water but dissolves in acid and base, whereas the full double acid and the full double salt are very soluble. The options given are A, B, C, D, and the user wants to know which one is correct and how to experimentally verify it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what potassium hydrogen tartrate is. Tartrate is the conjugate base of tartaric acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid. So, potassium hydrogen tartrate would be the potassium salt of the hydrogen tartrate ion. The full double acid would be tartaric acid (H2C4H4O6), and the full double salt might be something like K2C4H4O6, which is potassium tartrate. \n\nNow, solubility in water. Generally, salts are more soluble if they can form strong ionic interactions with water. But potassium hydrogen tartrate (KHC4H4O6) is not very soluble. Why? The options suggest something about chelation of potassium ions. \n\nChelation involves the formation of multiple bonds between a ligand and a metal ion, creating a ring structure. If the hydrogen tartrate ion can chelate the potassium ion, that might make the complex more stable, leading to lower solubility because the complex is already a self-contained unit that doesn't dissociate easily in water. In contrast, the full double salt (like K2C4H4O6) would have two potassium ions, maybe not chelated in the same way, so they dissociate into ions more readily, increasing solubility.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Talks about D or L hydrogen tartrate chelating potassium, leading to precipitation. Meso would be more soluble. But the question is about why the single salt is insoluble. The mention of chirality (D/L vs meso) might relate to the ability to chelate. However, I'm not sure how chirality directly affects chelation here. The question is about the structure allowing chelation.\n\nB: Suggests that the single salt chelates potassium, filling all coordination sites, making a neutral complex. Adding methyl chloride would make methyl ethers, which don't coordinate the same. But the question is about solubility. If the complex is neutral and self-contained, it might not dissociate, hence less soluble. But how does methyl chloride affect this? Methyl chloride is a reagent that could react with alcohols (if any) to form ethers. Wait, tartrate has hydroxyl groups? No, tartaric acid is HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH. So, hydrogen tartrate would have one COO- and one COOH group, but the hydroxyl groups are still present. So, if the hydroxyls are involved in chelating potassium, then modifying them (like forming ethers) would prevent chelation. But B says adding methyl chloride (which would methylate the hydroxyls) would make them not coordinate. If the complex is less stable, maybe solubility increases. But the option is about verifying by adding methyl chloride, which would test if the solubility is due to chelation. But the answer part is about why it's insoluble, so B's explanation might be part of the answer, but the experimental verification part is about methyl chloride. However, the question asks for the reason and how to verify. So maybe B is a possible answer.\n\nC: Similar to B, but talks about oxidation of alcohols to ketones. Oxidizing would change the geometry from sp3 to sp2, preventing correct chelation. If you oxidize the hydroxyl groups to ketones, then the chelation is prevented. So if you do that and the solubility increases, that would support the chelation theory. So C's explanation is about the reason (chelation) and the verification by oxidation.\n\nD: Also similar, but suggests forming a ketal with acetone. Ketals are formed from diols reacting with ketones. If the hydroxyl groups form a ketal, they can't chelate potassium anymore. So adding acetone would form a ketal, and if solubility increases, that supports the chelation idea. So D is about the same reasoning as B and C but uses a different reagent.\n\nThe question is which option correctly explains the solubility difference. The key is that the single salt (KHC4H4O6) forms a chelated complex with potassium, making it less soluble because the complex is neutral and doesn't dissociate. The full double salt (like K2C4H4O6) would have two potassium ions, maybe not chelated in the same way, so they dissociate into ions, increasing solubility.\n\nLooking at the options, all B, C, D talk about the chelation filling coordination sites. The difference is in the experimental verification part. The question asks how this could be experimentally verified. So the correct answer would be the one that gives a valid experimental method to test the chelation hypothesis.\n\nOption C suggests oxidation of alcohols to ketones. If you oxidize the hydroxyl groups to ketones, the structure changes from sp3 to sp2, preventing chelation. If you then test solubility and find it's higher, that supports the idea that chelation was the reason for low solubility. Similarly, D suggests forming a ketal with acetone, which would block the hydroxyls from chelating. If that increases solubility, that supports the idea.\n\nOption B mentions adding methyl chloride to form methyl ethers. But methyl chloride is a methylating agent, but typically, methylating agents like methyl iodide or dimethyl sulfate are used. Methyl chloride might not be a good reagent for this, but assuming it works, forming ethers would prevent chelation. So if you treat the salt with methyl chloride, form methyl ethers, and then check solubility, if it increases, that supports the chelation theory.\n\nBut which of these is a standard method? Forming a ketal (option D) is a common method to protect diol groups. Oxidation (option C) would change the structure more permanently. However, oxidation might not be feasible if the hydroxyls are in a 1,2-diol, which can be oxidized to a diketone (if using a strong oxidizing agent), but that would require specific conditions. Methylating agents (option B) could work but methyl chloride is a less common reagent for that.\n\nThe question is about how to experimentally verify the hypothesis. The correct answer would be the one where modifying the structure (blocking the hydroxyls) leads to increased solubility, thus proving that the hydroxyls were involved in chelation.\n\nBetween B, C, D: The answer is likely C or D. Let me think again. The hydrogen tartrate ion has hydroxyl groups that can coordinate to potassium. If you form a ketal with acetone, those hydroxyls are converted into an acetal (ketal), which can't coordinate. So adding acetone would form a ketal, making the compound more soluble. If that's the case, then D is correct. Alternatively, oxidation to ketones (option C) would also prevent coordination, but oxidation might not be the best method. \n\nWait, the structure of tartaric acid is HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH. The two hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons (C2 and C3). If you oxidize them, you would need a strong oxidizing agent, but those hydroxyls are primary or secondary? The hydroxyls are on the second and third carbons, which are adjacent to the carboxylic acid groups. If you try to oxidize them, you might get different products. For example, if you use a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4, you might oxidize the hydroxyls to carboxylic acids or ketones, but that might not be straightforward. Whereas forming a ketal with acetone is a standard method to protect diols, so D is more feasible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The experimental verification would involve adding acetone to form a ketal, which would prevent the hydroxyls from chelating potassium, leading to increased solubility. Therefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
