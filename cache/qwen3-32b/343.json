The operator $\\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given by specific 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\\hbar/2$. The question provides the matrices for each component, and I need to figure out the normalized eigenvector. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in quantum mechanics, operators corresponding to spin components are usually represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by $\\hbar/2$. The given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ look like the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by $\\hbar/2$, which makes sense because for spin-1/2 particles like muons, the spin operators are indeed proportional to the Pauli matrices.\n\nSo, the Pauli matrices are:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the given operator components $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$, $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$, and $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the eigenvector of the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$, where $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Since $\\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, its direction can be parametrized by an angle $\\theta$ from the z-axis (or x-axis, depending on convention). Let me define $\\vec{n}$ as making an angle $\\theta$ with the z-axis. So, the components of $\\vec{n}$ would be $(\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$ if we consider the angle from the z-axis. Wait, actually, if it's in the x-z plane, then the direction can be parametrized by an angle from the z-axis or x-axis. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we define $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane with polar angle $\\theta$ from the z-axis. Then, the components would be:\n\n$$\n\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)\n$$\n\nAlternatively, if it's from the x-axis, it would be $(\\cos\\theta, 0, \\sin\\theta)$. Hmm. Depending on the convention. But since the problem mentions the x-z plane, and since the answer options involve $\\theta/2$, it's likely that the standard parametrization is being used where the angle is from the z-axis. But let me confirm.\n\nIn any case, the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ would be:\n\n$$\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z\n$$\n\nBut since $\\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$. So,\n\n$$\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z\n$$\n\nLet me denote $n_x = \\sin\\theta$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$ assuming $\\theta$ is measured from the z-axis. Alternatively, if $\\theta$ is measured from the x-axis, $n_x = \\cos\\theta$ and $n_z = \\sin\\theta$. But since the answer options have $\\theta/2$, perhaps we need to check both possibilities.\n\nBut first, let's proceed. The operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2} (n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z)\n$$\n\nSo, substituting the matrices:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}\nn_z & n_x \\\\\nn_x & -n_z\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let me write out $n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z$:\n\n$$\nn_x \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + n_z \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \n\\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nYes, that's correct. So the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Let's denote the matrix as $M = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$. So, we need to solve:\n\n$$\nM \\psi = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\psi\n$$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\psi = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\psi\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\hbar/2$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{pmatrix} \\psi = \\psi\n$$\n\nSo, the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{pmatrix} \\psi = \\psi\n$$\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\psi = 0\n$$\n\nWait, no. The original equation is $M \\psi = \\lambda \\psi$, where $\\lambda = \\hbar/2$. After dividing by $\\hbar/2$, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{pmatrix} \\psi = \\psi\n$$\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\psi = 0\n$$\n\nWait, actually, the matrix equation is $M \\psi = \\lambda \\psi$, so $M - \\lambda I$ times $\\psi$ equals zero. Since $\\lambda = 1$ (because we divided by $\\hbar/2$), then:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\psi = 0\n$$\n\nWhich gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\psi = 0\n$$\n\nBut since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Also, the eigenvalues of the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ should be $\\pm \\hbar/2$, since for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues are $\\pm \\hbar/2$ along any direction. Let me check that.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} (n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z)$ can be found by computing the eigenvalues of $n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z$. The eigenvalues of a Pauli vector $\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ are $\\pm 1$, so multiplying by $\\hbar/2$ gives $\\pm \\hbar/2$, which matches the question. Therefore, our setup is correct.\n\nSo, going back to solving:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n\nWhich gives us two equations:\n\n1. $(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0$\n2. $n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0$\n\nThese two equations should be consistent because the determinant of the matrix should be zero for a non-trivial solution. Let me check the determinant:\n\n$$\n(n_z - 1)(-n_z - 1) - (n_x)^2 = (-n_z^2 - n_z + n_z + 1) - n_x^2 = (-n_z^2 + 1) - n_x^2 = 1 - (n_x^2 + n_z^2) = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\n\nYes, determinant is zero, so the equations are consistent.\n\nSo, let's take the first equation:\n\n$$\n(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 \\implies b = \\frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} a\n$$\n\nAssuming $n_x \\neq 0$. If $n_x = 0$, then $\\vec{n}$ is along the z-axis, and the eigenvector is straightforward. But since $\\vec{n}$ is arbitrary in the x-z plane, let's proceed with general $n_x$ and $n_z$.\n\nLet me express $n_z$ and $n_x$ in terms of an angle. Let me assume that $\\vec{n}$ is parametrized by an angle $\\theta$ from the z-axis. Therefore:\n\n$$\nn_z = \\cos\\theta, \\quad n_x = \\sin\\theta\n$$\n\nSo substituting into the expression for $b$:\n\n$$\nb = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} a\n$$\n\nRecall that $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$. Therefore:\n\n$$\nb = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} a = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} a = \\tan(\\theta/2) a\n$$\n\nTherefore, $b = \\tan(\\theta/2) a$. Let me write the eigenvector as:\n\n$$\n\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo normalize this vector, let's compute the norm squared:\n\n$$\n|a|^2 [1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)] = |a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2)\n$$\n\nTherefore, to make the norm 1, we set:\n\n$$\n|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1 \\implies |a| = \\cos(\\theta/2)\n$$\n\nAssuming $a$ is real and positive for simplicity (since the overall phase doesn't matter in quantum states), we can write:\n\n$$\na = \\cos(\\theta/2), \\quad b = \\sin(\\theta/2)\n$$\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check this. If $b = \\tan(\\theta/2) a$, and $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, then $b = \\sin(\\theta/2)$. Yes, that's correct. So the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nBut wait, let me check for specific cases. For example, if $\\theta = 0$, meaning $\\vec{n}$ is along the z-axis, then the eigenvector should be the eigenstate of $P_z$ with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. However, according to our formula, when $\\theta = 0$, $\\cos(0/2) = 1$, $\\sin(0/2) = 0$, so we get $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is correct. Similarly, if $\\theta = \\pi$, meaning $\\vec{n}$ is along the negative z-axis, the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ would correspond to the spin-down state? Wait no, if $\\vec{n}$ is along the negative z-axis, then the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = -P_z$, so the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ would correspond to the eigenstate of $-P_z$ with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$, which would be the eigenstate of $P_z$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar/2$, i.e., $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let's check our formula with $\\theta = \\pi$:\n\n$$\n\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0, \\sin(\\pi/2) = 1 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWhich is correct. So that seems to check out.\n\nAnother test case: $\\theta = \\pi/2$, so $\\vec{n}$ is along the x-axis. The eigenvector should be the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The eigenstates of $P_x$ are $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. According to our formula, when $\\theta = \\pi/2$:\n\n$$\n\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{2}/2 \\\\ \\sqrt{2}/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWhich is indeed the correct eigenvector for $+\\hbar/2$ eigenvalue of $P_x$. Perfect. Therefore, our general formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nBut looking at the answer options, option D is $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$, which matches exactly. However, let me check if there are any other considerations. For example, sometimes when you have a direction in the x-z plane, you might have a phase factor depending on the orientation. But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane (i.e., y-component is zero), there's no azimuthal angle $\\phi$ involved. However, in the answer options, option C is $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$, which is the general case for a direction on the Bloch sphere with polar angle $\\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\\phi$. But since our direction is in the x-z plane, $\\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$, but since we are in the x-z plane, there's no $\\phi$, so the general formula reduces to option D. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nBut let me check the other options. Option A is $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$. Wait, the eigenvector we found doesn't have any $\\hbar$ in it. The operator $\\vec{P}$ has $\\hbar/2$ factors, but the eigenvectors are just vectors in the Hilbert space, independent of $\\hbar$. The eigenvalues are $+\\hbar/2$, but the eigenvectors themselves are just spinors with complex numbers. So the presence of $\\hbar$ in options A and B seems incorrect. The eigenvector is a dimensionless vector (assuming we're working in units where $\\hbar$ is just a constant), so the elements shouldn't have $\\hbar$ in them. Therefore, options A and B can be eliminated because they include $\\hbar$ in the components of the eigenvector, which is not correct. Similarly, option C has $e^{i\\phi}$, but since $\\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, $\\phi = 0$, so $e^{i\\phi} = 1$, and then it would be $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$, which is not the same as our result. Wait, but our result is in terms of $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$. Therefore, option C is different. However, if $\\phi$ is zero, then option C would be $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$, which is not the same as our result. So option C is incorrect. Therefore, option D is the correct one.\n\nBut let me just think again. In the standard Bloch sphere parametrization, a general spin state for a direction given by polar angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ is:\n\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta/2) |0\\rangle + e^{i\\phi} \\sin(\\theta/2) |1\\rangle\n$$\n\nWhich corresponds to the vector:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ e^{i\\phi} \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nIn our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, $\\phi = 0$ (if we take the direction in the x-z plane with polar angle $\\theta$ from the z-axis, then the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ is zero). Therefore, the eigenvector would be:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWhich matches option D. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there is any possible mistake in my derivation. For example, sometimes the angle is defined differently. Suppose instead that $\\theta$ is the angle from the x-axis. Let me try that. Let me assume that $\\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, making an angle $\\theta$ with the x-axis. Then the components would be $n_x = \\cos\\theta$, $n_z = \\sin\\theta$. Then following the same steps:\n\nThe ratio $b/a = (1 - n_z)/n_x = (1 - \\sin\\theta)/\\cos\\theta$. Let's compute that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{(1 - \\sin\\theta)}{\\cos\\theta} \\times \\frac{1 + \\sin\\theta}{1 + \\sin\\theta} = \\frac{1 - \\sin^2\\theta}{\\cos\\theta(1 + \\sin\\theta)} = \\frac{\\cos^2\\theta}{\\cos\\theta(1 + \\sin\\theta)} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{1 + \\sin\\theta}\n$$\n\nNow, using the identity:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{1 + \\sin\\theta} = \\tan\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right )\n$$\n\nAlternatively, let's express in terms of half-angle formulas. Let me write:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{1 + \\sin\\theta} = \\frac{ \\cos\\theta }{ 1 + \\sin\\theta } = \\frac{ \\cos\\theta }{ 1 + \\sin\\theta } \\times \\frac{1 - \\sin\\theta}{1 - \\sin\\theta} = \\frac{ \\cos\\theta (1 - \\sin\\theta) }{ 1 - \\sin^2\\theta } = \\frac{ \\cos\\theta (1 - \\sin\\theta) }{ \\cos^2\\theta } = \\frac{1 - \\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} = \\tan\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right )\n$$\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Let me try specific angles. Suppose $\\theta = 0$, meaning $\\vec{n}$ is along the x-axis. Then:\n\n$$\nb/a = (1 - 0)/1 = 1, so b = a. Then the eigenvector is [a, a], normalized to [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct for the +1 eigenvalue of σ_x. According to our formula above, if θ is the angle from the x-axis, then with θ=0:\n\ncos(θ/2) = cos(0) = 1, sin(θ/2) = sin(0) = 0. But according to our previous result, the eigenvector would be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] = [1, 0], which is incorrect for θ=0 (direction along x-axis). Therefore, this suggests that if θ is measured from the x-axis, our previous derivation is invalid. Therefore, our original assumption that θ is measured from the z-axis is correct because when θ=0 (along z-axis), we get [1, 0], which is correct, and when θ=π/2 (along x-axis), we get [cos(π/4), sin(π/4)] = [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct. Therefore, θ is measured from the z-axis.\n\nTherefore, the correct eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which is option D. The other options have issues:\n\n- A and B have $\\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect.\n\n- C has $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$, and also includes a phase factor $e^{i\\phi}$, which is unnecessary here since $\\phi=0$ for the x-z plane. However, if the angle were in the general case with $\\phi$, then C would be correct. But since we are restricted to the x-z plane, $\\phi=0$ and the angle is θ/2, not θ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
