The greater the difference, the more **polar** the bond is.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding Electronegativity and Bond Polarity**\n\nElectronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons in a covalent bond. The **Pauling scale** is commonly used to quantify this, and it ranges from approximately 0.7 (for very electropositive elements like cesium) to 4.0 (for fluorine, the most electronegative element).\n\nBond **polarity** increases with the **difference in electronegativity** between the two bonded atoms. If the difference is large, the bond is **polar covalent** or even **ionic** in nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option**\n\nWe will use the Pauling electronegativity values for the elements involved:\n\n| Element | Electronegativity (Pauling scale) |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|\n| Fluorine (F) | 3.98 |\n| Oxygen (O) | 3.44 |\n| Nitrogen (N) | 3.04 |\n| Sulfur (S) | 2.58 |\n| Carbon (C) | 2.55 |\n| Phosphorus (P) | 2.19 |\n| Boron (B) | 2.04 |\n\n#### **A: S–O**\n- Electronegativity of S = 2.58\n- Electronegativity of O = 3.44\n- **Difference** = 3.44 – 2.58 = **0.86**\n\n#### **B: P–F**\n- Electronegativity of P = 2.19\n- Electronegativity of F = 3.98\n- **Difference** = 3.98 – 2.19 = **1.79**\n\n#### **C: C–B**\n- Electronegativity of C = 2.55\n- Electronegativity of B = 2.04\n- **Difference** = 2.55 – 2.04 = **0.51**\n\n#### **D: C–N**\n- Electronegativity of C = 2.55\n- Electronegativity of N = 3.04\n- **Difference** = 3.04 – 2.55 = **0.49**\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison of Differences**\n\n| Bond | Electronegativity Difference |\n|------|-----------------------------|\n| S–O | 0.86 |\n| P–F | **1.79** |\n| C–B | 0.51 |\n| C–N | 0.49 |\n\nThe bond with the **largest electronegativity difference** is **P–F**, with a difference of **1.79**, indicating the **strongest bond polarity** among the options.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe bond with the **largest bond polarity** is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these bonds has the largest bond polarity. The options are S–O, P–F, C–B, and C–N. Hmm, bond polarity... I remember that bond polarity has to do with the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved in the bond. The greater the difference, the more polar the bond is. So, I need to compare the electronegativities of the atoms in each pair and see which pair has the highest difference.\n\nFirst, let me recall the general trends in electronegativity. Electronegativity increases as you move across a period (row) in the periodic table from left to right and decreases as you move down a group (column). So, elements on the top right of the periodic table have higher electronegativity. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, right?\n\nLet me list out the elements involved here:\n\n- Sulfur (S)\n- Oxygen (O)\n- Phosphorus (P)\n- Fluorine (F)\n- Carbon (C)\n- Boron (B)\n- Nitrogen (N)\n\nNow, I need to find the electronegativity values for each of these elements. I might not remember the exact numbers, but I can approximate based on the periodic table trends and common knowledge.\n\nStarting with S–O. Sulfur is in group 16, period 3. Oxygen is in group 16, period 2. Since electronegativity increases up a group, oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. The difference here would be moderate. Let me think, sulfur's electronegativity is about 2.5, and oxygen is about 3.5. So the difference is 1.0. Wait, is that right? I might need to double-check these numbers. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Pauling scale values. From memory, oxygen is around 3.44 and sulfur is around 2.58. So the difference is approximately 0.86. That's a moderate difference.\n\nNext is P–F. Phosphorus is in group 15, period 3. Fluorine is in group 17, period 2. Fluorine is very electronegative, about 3.98. Phosphorus is less so. Let me recall, phosphorus is around 2.19. So the difference here would be 3.98 - 2.19 = 1.79. That's a larger difference compared to S–O. So P–F is more polar.\n\nNow C–B. Carbon is group 14, period 2. Boron is group 13, period 2. Electronegativity for boron is around 2.04, carbon is around 2.55. The difference is 2.55 - 2.04 = 0.51. That's a smaller difference, so less polar than the previous two.\n\nC–N. Carbon and nitrogen. Carbon is 2.55, nitrogen is around 3.04. The difference is 3.04 - 2.55 = 0.49. Wait, that's even smaller than C–B? Hmm, that seems odd. Wait, maybe I mixed up the electronegativity values. Let me check again. Carbon is 2.55, nitrogen is 3.04. So the difference is 0.49. So that's actually a small difference. So C–N is less polar than P–F and S–O.\n\nSo comparing all the differences:\n\n- S–O: ~0.86\n- P–F: ~1.79\n- C–B: ~0.51\n- C–N: ~0.49\n\nSo the largest difference is in P–F, so the bond polarity should be highest there. Therefore, the answer should be B: P–F.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Let me cross-verify the electronegativity values. For example, I remember that fluorine is the most electronegative at 4.0, oxygen is 3.5, nitrogen is 3.0, carbon is 2.5, boron is 2.0. So:\n\n- S (2.5) and O (3.5): difference 1.0\n- P (2.1) and F (4.0): difference 1.9\n- C (2.5) and B (2.0): difference 0.5\n- C (2.5) and N (3.0): difference 0.5\n\nSo using these rounded numbers, the difference for P–F is 1.9, which is higher than S–O's 1.0. So yes, P–F is the most polar. Therefore, the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes bond polarity also depends on the type of bond, like single vs double bonds. But the question doesn't specify, so I think we can assume it's referring to single bonds. Also, bond polarity is purely based on electronegativity difference, regardless of bond type. So even if there's a double bond, the polarity is still determined by the electronegativity difference. So in this case, the main factor is the difference in electronegativity.\n\nAnother check: let me recall some standard electronegativity values. According to the Pauling scale:\n\n- Fluorine: 3.98\n- Oxygen: 3.44\n- Nitrogen: 3.04\n- Chlorine: 3.16\n- Carbon: 2.55\n- Sulfur: 2.58\n- Phosphorus: 2.19\n- Boron: 2.04\n\nSo recalculating:\n\nS–O: 3.44 (O) - 2.58 (S) = 0.86\n\nP–F: 3.98 (F) - 2.19 (P) = 1.79\n\nC–B: 2.55 (C) - 2.04 (B) = 0.51\n\nC–N: 3.04 (N) - 2.55 (C) = 0.49\n\nYes, so the differences are as above. So P–F has the highest difference. Therefore, the correct answer is B: P–F.\n</think>"}
