I need to solve this problem about an arithmetic sequence. The original sequence has terms that add up to 715. Then, each term is increased by the kth odd positive integer, and the new sum is 836. I need to find the sum of the first, last, and middle term of the original sequence. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if the first term is a and the common difference is d, then the terms are a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., up to some number of terms.\n\nLet me denote the number of terms in the sequence as n. Then, the sum of the original arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = (n/2) * [2a + (n - 1)d]\n\nAnd this sum is given as 715. So,\n\n(n/2)[2a + (n - 1)d] = 715.  --- (1)\n\nNow, the problem says that each term is increased by the kth odd positive integer. The kth odd positive integer is 2k - 1. For example, when k=1, it's 1; k=2, it's 3; k=3, it's 5, etc. So, the new sequence is:\n\nOriginal term + (2k - 1) for each term.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the new sequence is the original sum plus the sum of these increments. The original sum is 715, and the new sum is 836. Therefore, the total increment is 836 - 715 = 121.\n\nSo, the sum of the increments is 121. Let me write that down:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = 121.  --- (2)\n\nSo, I need to compute this sum and set it equal to 121. Let me recall that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n². Wait, is that true?\n\nYes! The sum of the first n odd numbers is n². For example, 1 + 3 = 4 (which is 2²), 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 (which is 3²), etc. So, Sum_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = n². Therefore, equation (2) becomes:\n\nn² = 121 => n = 11. Since n is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nOkay, so the number of terms in the sequence is 11. That's good progress.\n\nSo now, we know n = 11. Let me plug that back into equation (1):\n\n(11/2)[2a + (11 - 1)d] = 715\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/2)[2a + 10d] = 715\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n11[2a + 10d] = 1430\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\n2a + 10d = 1430 / 11\n\nLet me compute 1430 divided by 11. Let's see:\n\n11 * 130 = 1430, right? 11*100=1100, 11*30=330, so 1100+330=1430. Yes! So,\n\n2a + 10d = 130\n\nSimplify that equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\na + 5d = 65. --- (3)\n\nSo, equation (3) is a relation between a and d. Now, since we need to find the sum of the first, last, and middle term of the original sequence, let's figure out what those terms are.\n\nFirst term: a\n\nLast term: Since there are 11 terms, the last term is the 11th term. In an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is a + (n - 1)d. So, the 11th term is a + 10d.\n\nMiddle term: Since there are 11 terms, which is odd, the middle term is the 6th term. The 6th term is a + 5d.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first, last, and middle term is:\n\na + [a + 10d] + [a + 5d] = 3a + 15d.\n\nBut from equation (3), we have a + 5d = 65. Therefore, 3a + 15d is just 3*(a + 5d) = 3*65 = 195.\n\nWait, so is the answer 195? That seems straightforward. Let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nFirst, I found n by using the fact that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n², which equals 121, so n=11. Then, using the sum formula for arithmetic sequences, I found that 2a + 10d = 130, which simplifies to a + 5d = 65. Then, since the first term is a, the last term is a + 10d, and the middle term is a + 5d. Adding them together gives 3a + 15d, which is 3*(a + 5d) = 3*65 = 195. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify if my initial assumption that the sum of increments is n² is correct. Let me compute Sum_{k=1}^n (2k - 1). Let's take n=11. The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2*11 - 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 21. How many terms is that? 11 terms. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). So that would be (11/2)*(1 + 21) = (11/2)*22 = 11*11 = 121. Which matches the difference between 836 and 715. So that checks out. Therefore, n=11 is correct.\n\nThen, the original sum is 715. Let me check if with n=11, the formula gives us the correct relation. The original sum is (11/2)[2a + 10d] = 715. Which simplifies to 11*(a + 5d) = 715. Therefore, a + 5d = 715 / 11. Let me compute 715 divided by 11. 11*65 = 715. Yes, because 11*70=770, which is 55 more than 715, so subtract 5*11=55, so 70 - 5 = 65. Therefore, 11*65=715. Therefore, a + 5d = 65. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first, last, and middle term is 3*(a + 5d) = 3*65=195. So the answer is 195. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{195}.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any wrong assumptions. Let me think again.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by actually trying to find a and d?\n\nWell, if I need to find a and d, I need another equation, but with the given information, we only have one equation (a + 5d = 65). However, since the problem doesn't ask for a and d individually, but rather the sum 3a + 15d, which is 3*(a + 5d), we don't need to find a and d separately. Therefore, even with just equation (3), we can compute the required sum. Therefore, the answer is indeed 195.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute a and d just for fun. Suppose I assume some value for d. But since we only have one equation, there are infinitely many solutions. However, maybe there are constraints on a and d? For example, terms of the sequence should be integers? Wait, the problem doesn't specify that. The problem just says an arithmetic sequence. So unless there's more constraints, there are infinitely many arithmetic sequences with 11 terms summing to 715. However, regardless of a and d, the required sum is always 3*(a + 5d) = 195. Therefore, regardless of specific a and d, the answer is 195. Therefore, I think this is correct.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Let me pick a value for d and compute a, then check if the sum of first, last, and middle term is 195.\n\nFor example, let me choose d = 0. Then the sequence is all a's. Then, sum is 11a = 715 => a = 715 / 11 = 65. Then, the first term is 65, last term is 65, middle term is 65. Sum is 65 + 65 + 65 = 195. Correct. So that works.\n\nAnother example, let me choose d = 1. Then, from equation (3): a + 5*1 = 65 => a = 60. So the original sequence starts at 60, with difference 1. The first term is 60, last term is a + 10d = 60 + 10 = 70, middle term is a + 5d = 65. Sum is 60 + 70 + 65 = 195. Correct again. Another example.\n\nLet me take d = 2. Then a + 5*2 = 65 => a = 65 - 10 = 55. First term is 55, last term is 55 + 10*2 = 55 + 20 = 75, middle term is 55 + 5*2 = 55 + 10 = 65. Sum is 55 + 75 + 65 = 195. Yep, same result. So regardless of d, the answer is 195. Therefore, the answer is 195. Therefore, I think this is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any possible mistake in interpreting the problem. For example, the problem says \"the terms of the new sequence add to 836\". The new sequence is each term increased by the kth odd positive integer. So, the increment is adding 1, 3, 5,... to each term. Therefore, the total increment is sum_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = n² = 121. Which gives n=11. Then, the rest follows. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the problem statement? For example, maybe \"the kth term is increased by the kth odd positive integer\"—does that mean each term is increased by the kth odd integer, where k is the position? Which is how I interpreted it. For example, first term (k=1) increased by 1st odd integer (1), second term increased by 2nd odd integer (3), etc. So that seems right. Therefore, the total increment is sum_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = n². Therefore, n² = 121 => n=11. All steps seem correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The sum of the first, last, and middle term is 195.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{195}\n</think>"}
