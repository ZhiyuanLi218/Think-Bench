Let me start by recalling what beta decay is. Beta decay involves the transformation of a neutron into a proton, which emits a beta particle. A beta particle is an electron, right? So the symbol for a beta particle is usually written as either β⁻ or as ⁰₋₁e. \n\nIn beta decay, the atomic number (the number of protons) increases by one because a neutron becomes a proton. The mass number should stay the same because a neutron is just converting into a proton and an electron. So the parent isotope will have one more proton and the same mass number. \n\nThe element in question is Iodine-131, which has an atomic number of 53. After beta decay, the new element should have an atomic number of 54. Let me check the options to see which one matches this.\n\nLooking at option B: it shows the decay to Xe-131 (Xenon has atomic number 54) and a positron? Wait, no, the beta particle here is written as ⁰₁e. Wait, hold on. The beta particle is usually ⁰₋₁e for beta minus decay. If it's ⁰₊₁e, that would be a positron, which is beta plus decay (positron emission). But Iodine-131 undergoes beta minus decay, right? So the emitted particle should be an electron, so the beta particle would have a -1 charge. \n\nSo option B is written as 1⁰e with a superscript plus? Wait, the notation in the options might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the options again. \n\nOption B: _{53}^{131}I → _{54}^{131}Xe + _{1}^{0}e. Wait, the subscript for the electron here is 1, which would imply a charge of +1? Because the standard notation for a positron is _{+1}^0e. But maybe there's a formatting issue here. If the beta particle is _{-1}^0e, then in beta minus decay, the equation would have the daughter element with atomic number increased by 1, and the beta particle as _{-1}^0e. \n\nSo if option B is written as _{53}I → _{54}Xe + _{1}^0e, that would actually be incorrect because the electron should have a -1 subscript. Unless there's a typo in the option. Alternatively, maybe the plus sign is misplaced. Let me think. \n\nIn beta minus decay, the equation is: _Z^A P → _{Z+1}^A D + _{-1}^0e. So the correct product should have Z+1, and the beta particle with -1. So for I-131, Z is 53, so daughter should be 54. Looking at the options, option B shows daughter as 54Xe, which is correct. The beta particle is written as _{1}^0e with a plus sign. Maybe that's a formatting error, and it's supposed to be _{-1}^0e? If that's the case, then option B would be correct. But if the beta particle is actually a positron (which would be _{+1}^0e), then that's beta plus decay, which is different. \n\nBut Iodine-131 is known to undergo beta minus decay. Let me confirm. Yes, I-131 decays by beta emission to Xe-131. So the correct equation should have Xe-131 and a beta particle (electron). So if option B is supposed to show the electron with a -1 subscript, but due to formatting it's written as +1, then maybe there's confusion. Alternatively, maybe the option is written correctly. Let me check the notation again. \n\nIn standard notation, a beta particle is written as ⁰₋₁β or ⁰₋₁e. A positron is ⁰₊₁β or ⁰₊₁e. So if option B is written as _{53}^{131}I → _{54}^{131}Xe + _{1}^{0}e, that would actually be a positron, which would be beta plus decay. But I-131 does beta minus decay. Therefore, option B is incorrect if it's a positron. But maybe there's a typo in the option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the option is written with the charge as a superscript. For example, sometimes people write the beta particle as ⁰β⁻ or ⁰e⁻. If the option is written with a plus sign, maybe it's a formatting mistake. Alternatively, perhaps in the original question, the notation is different. \n\nLet me check the other options. \n\nOption A: I-131 decaying into Sb-127 and two helium-4 nuclei. Helium-4 is an alpha particle. So this would be alpha decay, but with two alphas? Let's check the numbers. The mass number of I is 131. If two He-4 (each mass 4) are emitted, total mass lost is 8, so daughter would have mass 131-8=123. But Sb here is 127, which doesn't add up. So this can't be right. So option A is incorrect. \n\nOption C: I-131 decaying into I-130 and a neutron. The neutron is written as _0^1n? Wait, the neutron's symbol is _0^1n. But here the option is written as _0 1 n? Maybe formatting issue. If it's a neutron, then the mass number would decrease by 1? But I-131 losing a neutron would become I-130, which has same atomic number (53), since neutrons don't affect atomic number. But this is neutron emission, which is a rare type of decay. Iodine-131 doesn't undergo neutron emission; it undergoes beta decay. So option C is incorrect. \n\nOption D: I-131 decaying into Te-130 and a proton (Hydrogen-1). The mass numbers: 131 → 130 + 1, which adds up. The atomic numbers: 53 → 52 (Te has Z=52) + 1 (for H), so 52 +1 =53. That works. But this would be proton emission. However, I-131 doesn't emit protons; it undergoes beta decay. So option D is incorrect. \n\nSo back to option B. If the decay is to Xe-131 and a beta particle, then the equation is correct. But the notation for the beta particle in option B is written as _{1}^0 e. If that's supposed to be _{-1}^0 e, then it's correct. But if it's written as _{+1}^0 e, then it's a positron, which is incorrect. \n\nGiven that in the options, the notation might be a bit off due to formatting. Let me check the original question's options again. \n\nThe user wrote for option B: _{53}^{131}I → _{54}^{131}Xe + _{1}^{0} e. The subscript on the e is 1 with a superscript plus? Wait, the original question might have a formatting error. If it's written as 1^0 e with a plus sign, maybe it's a positron. However, in standard beta decay of I-131, the emitted particle is an electron. \n\nBut maybe the plus sign is just part of the notation. For example, sometimes people write the charge as a superscript. For example, beta particle is e⁻, which could be written with a minus sign after the symbol. If the option is written as _{54}Xe + _{1}^0 e^+, then it's a positron. But if it's just _{1}^0 e, that would imply a charge of +1? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me think again. In standard notation, the beta minus particle is an electron, which is represented as ⁰β⁻ or ⁰e⁻, which in the notation with subscript for atomic number (charge) would be _{-1}^0 e. \n\nSo if option B is written as _{53}I → _{54}Xe + _{+1}^0 e, that would be a positron, which is incorrect. But if it's written as _{-1}^0 e, then it's correct. However, the user's option B is written as _{1}^0 e. So the subscript is 1, which would mean a charge of +1? That would be a positron. \n\nBut I-131 does beta minus decay, not beta plus. Therefore, option B would be incorrect if it's a positron. But none of the other options are correct. Wait, but maybe the notation in the option is different. Maybe the plus sign is not part of the subscript? For example, maybe it's written as _{54}^{131}Xe^+ and then _{1}^0 e? That is, the Xe has a positive charge and the e is a regular electron? But in nuclear equations, charges are usually not shown because the emitted particles are considered as particles, not ions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formatting issue where the plus sign is misplaced. For example, maybe the beta particle is supposed to be _{-1}^0 e, but due to formatting, it's written as _{1}^0 e with a plus sign somewhere else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is B, assuming that the beta particle is an electron, and the notation is just written incorrectly. Because all other options are clearly wrong. \n\nGiven that, even though the notation might be confusing, option B is the only one that shows the correct daughter isotope (Xe-131 with Z=54) and the correct mass number (131 remains same). The emitted particle should be an electron. If the option has a typo and the subscript is -1 instead of +1, then it's correct. Since the other options are wrong, I think the intended correct answer is B. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n</think>"}
