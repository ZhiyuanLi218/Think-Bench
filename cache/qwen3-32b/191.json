The problem says that the container has a constant volume, and it's holding an ideal gas at volume V1, temperature T1, and pressure P1. Then the temperature is increased in an isochoric process. The question is asking which of the options is NOT true. The options are A through D, and I need to figure out which one isn't correct.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an isochoric process is. Isochoric means that the volume is constant. So, if the container is rigid and solid, that makes sense because it can't change its volume. So during this process, the volume V remains the same, which is V1. The temperature is increased, so T goes from T1 to a higher temperature, let's say T2 where T2 > T1. The question is about what happens when you increase the temperature of an ideal gas in a container that can't change its volume.\n\nLet me think about the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. In this case, since the volume is constant (isochoric), and assuming the amount of gas (n) doesn't change (which is a standard assumption unless stated otherwise), then if temperature T increases, pressure P must increase as well because V and n are constant. So P is directly proportional to T here. So that would mean that when temperature increases, pressure increases. So option B says \"The pressure increases,\" which should be true. So B is a true statement, so the answer is not B.\n\nOption D says \"The volume increases.\" But since it's an isochoric process, the volume is constant. So if the container is rigid, the volume can't change. Therefore, the volume doesn't increase. So D is saying the volume increases, which is false. So D is NOT true. But let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: \"The average speed of the molecules increases.\" The average speed of gas molecules is related to temperature. For an ideal gas, the root-mean-square speed is given by v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and M is molar mass. So if temperature increases, the average speed (or root-mean-square speed) should increase. Therefore, A is true. So A is a correct statement, so not the answer.\n\nOption C: \"The kinetic energy of the system increases.\" The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature. For an ideal gas, the internal energy U is a function of temperature only, and for monatomic gases, it's (3/2)nRT. Even for diatomic or polyatomic gases, the internal energy increases with temperature. Since the temperature is increasing, the kinetic energy (which contributes to internal energy) should increase. Therefore, C is true. So C is a correct statement.\n\nTherefore, the only one that is NOT true is D, because the volume doesn't increase in an isochoric process. The container is rigid, so volume is constant. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut let me just double-check. Sometimes, there might be nuances. For example, is there any scenario where even though temperature increases, the volume doesn't increase? Well, in an isochoric process by definition, volume is constant. So if the container is rigid, then yes, volume can't change. So D is definitely false. The other options are all consequences of increasing temperature at constant volume. So yes, D is the correct answer here.\n</think>"}
