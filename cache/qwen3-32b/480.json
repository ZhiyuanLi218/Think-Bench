The sequence starts with 0, and then each subsequent term is made by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer starting from 1. The example given is:\n\n- First term: 0\n- Second term: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Third term: 1 × 1 = 1\n- Fourth term: 1 + 2 = 3\n- Fifth term: 3 × 3 = 9\n- Sixth term: 9 + 4 = 13? Wait, the problem says the sixth term is 9... Hmm, wait let me check again.\n\nWait the problem says the sequence is 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27... Let me verify the example:\n\nFirst term is 0.\n\nSecond term: add 1 to first term: 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nThird term: multiply second term by 1: 1 × 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nFourth term: add 2 to third term: 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nFifth term: multiply fourth term by 3: 3 × 3 = 9. Wait, the problem says fifth term is 6? Wait, hold on, the problem says the sequence is 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27... So according to the problem, fifth term is 6? Wait that contradicts my calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the operations. The problem says \"alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1.\" So starting with the first operation, which is adding 1, then multiplying by 1, then adding 2, then multiplying by 2? Or is it adding/multiplying with the next integer each time?\n\nWait the problem says: \"the first term is 0. Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1. For instance, the second term is produced by adding 1 to the first term; the third term is produced by multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so on.\"\n\nAh, okay, so the operations alternate between adding and multiplying, starting with adding. The integers used for adding and multiplying also start at 1 and increase by 1 each time. So:\n\nTerm 1: 0\n\nTerm 2: Term1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nTerm3: Term2 × 1 = 1 × 1 = 1\n\nTerm4: Term3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTerm5: Term4 × 2 = 3 × 2 = 6\n\nTerm6: Term5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nTerm7: Term6 × 3 = 9 × 3 = 27\n\nTerm8: Term7 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31\n\nTerm9: Term8 × 4 = 31 × 4 = 124\n\nTerm10: Term9 + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129\n\nWait, so according to this, the sequence is 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, 31, 124, 129,...\n\nSo the problem asks for the first term that is greater than 125. Let me check the terms:\n\nTerm1: 0\n\nTerm2: 1\n\nTerm3: 1\n\nTerm4: 3\n\nTerm5: 6\n\nTerm6: 9\n\nTerm7: 27\n\nTerm8: 31\n\nTerm9: 124\n\nTerm10: 129\n\nSo term10 is 129, which is the first term greater than 125. But let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with term1: 0.\n\nTerm2: add 1 (the first integer) to term1: 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nTerm3: multiply by 1 (the same integer? Or next integer? Wait according to the problem statement:\n\n\"For instance, the second term is produced by adding 1 to the first term; the third term is produced by multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so on.\"\n\nSo after adding 1, then multiplying by 1, then adding 2, multiplying by 2? Wait, term4 is adding 2, term5 is multiplying by 2? Wait term5 in the example given in the problem is 6, which would be term4 (3) multiplied by 2: 3×2=6. Then term6 is adding 3: 6 + 3 = 9. Then term7 is multiplying by 3: 9×3=27. Then term8 is adding 4: 27 + 4 = 31. Term9 is multiplying by 4: 31×4=124. Term10 is adding 5: 124 + 5=129. Then term11 is multiplying by 5: 129×5=645. So term10 is 129, which is the first term exceeding 125. Therefore, the answer is 129?\n\nBut let me check again step by step:\n\nTerm1: 0\n\nTerm2: Term1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nTerm3: Term2 × 1 = 1 × 1 = 1\n\nTerm4: Term3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTerm5: Term4 × 2 = 3 × 2 = 6\n\nTerm6: Term5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nTerm7: Term6 × 3 = 9 × 3 = 27\n\nTerm8: Term7 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31\n\nTerm9: Term8 × 4 = 31 × 4 = 124\n\nTerm10: Term9 + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129\n\nTerm11: Term10 × 5 = 129 × 5 = 645\n\nSo yes, term10 is 129, which is the first term greater than 125. Therefore, the answer is 129. But let me check once again to make sure I didn't skip any terms or miscalculate.\n\nLet me write down all terms up to term10:\n\nn: term\n\n1: 0\n\n2: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3: 1 × 1 = 1\n\n4: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5: 3 × 2 = 6\n\n6: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n7: 9 × 3 = 27\n\n8: 27 + 4 = 31\n\n9: 31 × 4 = 124\n\n10: 124 + 5 = 129\n\nYes, that seems right. So term9 is 124, which is less than 125, term10 is 129 which is greater. So the first term exceeding 125 is 129.\n\nBut let me check term9 again. 31 × 4: 31×4 is 124, correct. Then term10 is adding 5: 124 + 5 = 129. Correct. Then term11 would be multiplying by 5, which is 129×5=645. So yes, 129 is the first term over 125.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 129. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe first term greater than 125 is \\boxed{129}.\n</think>"}
