This can happen in two possible scenarios:\n1. $ RT = 1 $, which is a very specific and unlikely condition unless the temperature is precisely chosen to satisfy this.\n2. $ \\Delta n = 0 $, meaning the number of moles of gaseous products equals the number of moles of gaseous reactants. In this case, $ (RT)^0 = 1 $, and hence $ K_p = K_c $.\n\n---\n\nLet's evaluate the given answer choices:\n\n- **A: At absolute zero for all reactions**  \n  While $ T = 0 $ would make $ RT = 0 $, this leads to undefined or problematic values in the equation (e.g., $ 0^0 $ is undefined). Moreover, the statement \"for all reactions\" is incorrect, because only reactions with $ \\Delta n = 0 $ would have $ K_p = K_c $, regardless of temperature. So this is **not correct**.\n\n- **B: When the concentrations are at standard state**  \n  Standard state refers to specific reference conditions (e.g., 1 atm for gases, 1 M for concentrations). However, $ K_c $ and $ K_p $ are equilibrium constants and are not directly tied to standard state values. This is **not a sufficient condition** for $ K_p = K_c $.\n\n- **C: When the concentrations are all 1.00 molar**  \n  If all concentrations are 1.00 M, $ K_c $ would be 1. However, $ K_p $ depends on the partial pressures, which are related to concentrations by $ P = cRT $. Unless $ RT = 1 $ or $ \\Delta n = 0 $, $ K_p $ will not necessarily equal $ K_c $. Thus, this condition is **not sufficient** on its own.\n\n- **D: When the reaction exhibits no change in pressure at constant volume**  \n  This is a key insight. At constant volume, pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas ($ P \\propto n $, from the ideal gas law $ PV = nRT $). If the pressure does not change, the number of moles of gas must remain constant, i.e., $ \\Delta n = 0 $. When $ \\Delta n = 0 $, then $ K_p = K_c $, which is exactly the condition we are looking for. Therefore, this is the **correct answer**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out when Kp and Kc have the same numerical value. Let me start by recalling what Kp and Kc are. Kp is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of partial pressures of the gaseous reactants and products, while Kc is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of concentrations (usually molarity) of the species involved. \n\nI remember there's a relationship between Kp and Kc, which involves the ideal gas law. The formula connecting them is Kp = Kc(RT)^(Δn), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Δn is the change in moles of gas between products and reactants. So Δn is calculated as (moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants). \n\nSo if Kp and Kc are to have the same numerical value, then the term (RT)^(Δn) must equal 1. That means either R*T must be 1, or Δn must be 0. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, R is the gas constant. Its value depends on the units used. For example, if we use R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), then R*T would be a number that varies with temperature. So unless T is specifically chosen so that R*T equals 1, which would be a particular temperature, this term won't be 1. However, the question is asking for when Kp and Kc have the same numerical value, regardless of specific temperature unless specified. So maybe the other condition is when Δn is zero. If Δn is zero, then regardless of R and T, the exponent makes (RT)^0 = 1, so Kp = Kc*1 => Kp = Kc. \n\nSo the key here is that when the change in moles of gas (Δn) is zero, then Kp equals Kc. That would happen when the number of moles of gaseous products is equal to the number of moles of gaseous reactants. For example, a reaction like H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g) has Δn = 2 - (1+1) = 0, so Kp would equal Kc here.\n\nNow looking at the answer choices:\n\nA: At absolute zero for all reactions. Absolute zero is 0 K. If T is 0 K, then R*T would be zero, so unless Δn is negative or positive, but even then, if T is zero, the term (RT)^Δn would be problematic (since you can't have T=0 in real systems and also, mathematically, zero raised to any power is zero unless the exponent is zero). But even if Δn is zero, then (RT)^0 is 1 regardless of T, so even at absolute zero, if Δn is zero, Kp would still equal Kc. However, the answer says \"for all reactions\", which would not be true because only reactions with Δn=0 would satisfy this. So A is incorrect.\n\nB: When the concentrations are at standard state. Standard state for concentrations is 1 M, but Kc is calculated using concentrations at equilibrium, not necessarily standard state. Also, standard state refers to specific conditions (like 1 M for solutions, 1 atm for gases, etc.), but Kc and Kp are equilibrium constants that depend on the reaction conditions. The numerical value of Kc or Kp isn't directly tied to standard state concentrations unless you're talking about standard Gibbs free energy, which is a different concept. So B might not be the right answer.\n\nC: When the concentrations are all 1.00 molar. If all concentrations are 1.00 M, then Kc would be 1 (since it's products over reactants each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients, all being 1). However, Kp would depend on the partial pressures. If concentrations are 1.00 M, using the ideal gas law PV = nRT, so P = (n/V)RT = concentration*RT. If concentration is 1.00 M, then P = RT. So unless RT is 1, the partial pressures wouldn't be 1 atm. Therefore, Kp would be (RT)^Δn. So unless Δn is zero, Kp would not equal Kc. However, if concentrations are 1.00 M, but Δn is not zero, then Kp would not be 1. Therefore, this answer is not universally correct unless Δn is zero. But the answer choice C says \"when the concentrations are all 1.00 molar\", which doesn't necessarily imply Δn is zero. So maybe C is not the right answer.\n\nD: When the reaction exhibits no change in pressure at constant volume. Hmm. If there's no change in pressure at constant volume, what does that imply? Let's think. For a reaction at constant volume, if pressure doesn't change, that might mean that the number of moles of gas remains the same. Because according to the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. If volume and temperature are constant, then pressure is proportional to n (number of moles). So if pressure doesn't change, then n must not change. Therefore, the reaction must have the same number of moles of gas on both sides. Which means Δn = 0. And if Δn is zero, then Kp = Kc. So answer D is essentially saying that when Δn is zero, which is when there's no change in moles of gas (so no change in pressure at constant volume), then Kp equals Kc. Therefore, D would be a correct answer.\n\nBut let me cross-check with the other options. The question is about when Kp and Kc have the same numerical value. So if the answer is D, then that's when Δn is zero, which makes sense. Alternatively, answer C is about concentrations being 1.00 M. But if concentrations are 1.00 M, then Kc is 1, but Kp would be (RT)^Δn. Unless Δn is zero, Kp would not be 1. So if Δn is zero, then Kp would also be 1. However, the condition in C is only about concentrations being 1.00 M, not about Δn. So if concentrations are 1.00 M but Δn is not zero, then Kc is 1 but Kp is not. So answer C is not sufficient. However, if Δn is zero, then regardless of concentrations, Kp equals Kc. Therefore, the correct condition is when Δn is zero. Which is captured by answer D: when the reaction exhibits no change in pressure at constant volume (i.e., same moles of gas on both sides). \n\nSo answer D is correct. Let me check the other options again. Answer B: standard state. Standard state for concentrations is 1 M, but Kc is not necessarily 1 at standard state. K is calculated at equilibrium, not at standard state concentrations. Answer A is incorrect as explained. Answer C is about concentrations being 1.00 M, which doesn't directly relate unless Δn is zero. Answer D is correct because no change in pressure at constant volume implies Δn=0, leading to Kp=Kc. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
