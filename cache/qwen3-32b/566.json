So, Bob and Alice each have a bag with one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. That means each bag starts with 5 balls. \n\nFirst, Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Then, Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag (which now has 6 balls) and puts it into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that after this process, the contents of the two bags are the same as they were initially. \n\nHmm. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me think about what happens when Alice moves a ball to Bob's bag. Since Alice's bag originally has 5 distinct colored balls, when she randomly selects one, there's a 1/5 chance for each color. After she moves one ball to Bob's bag, Bob's bag now has 6 balls: his original 5 plus Alice's one. \n\nThen, Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag of 6 and puts it back into Alice's bag. After this exchange, both bags should have 5 balls again. The question is, what's the probability that both bags have the same contents as they started with?\n\nWait, so initially, both had the same set of balls. After the exchange, we want them to have the same set again. So, effectively, the net result should be that the ball that Alice gave to Bob is returned to her, right? Because if Bob gives back the same ball that Alice gave him, then both bags are back to their original contents. If he gives back a different ball, then Alice's bag would have lost one color and gained another, and Bob's bag would have gained one and lost another, so they wouldn't be the same as before. \n\nIs that the case? Let me check. Suppose Alice gives Bob a blue ball. Then Bob's bag has an extra blue. If Bob then gives back the blue ball to Alice, then both bags are back to original. But if Bob gives back, say, a green ball (which he originally had), then Alice's bag would now have two blue and one green? Wait, no. Let me track the process.\n\nOriginal: Alice has {B, G, O, R, V}; Bob has {B, G, O, R, V}.\n\nAlice transfers one ball to Bob. Let's say she transfers color X. Now Alice has {B, G, O, R, V} minus X, and Bob has {B, G, O, R, V} plus X. Then Bob transfers one ball back to Alice. If Bob transfers back X, then Alice's bag is back to original (since she lost X and got X back), and Bob's bag is back to original (he had X added and then removed it). If Bob transfers back a different color, say Y, then Alice's bag will have replaced X with Y, and Bob's bag will have replaced Y with X. Therefore, their bags will not be the same as original. Therefore, the only way for the bags to be the same is if Bob transfers back the same color that Alice transferred to him. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: What is the probability that Bob transfers back the same color that Alice transferred to him?\n\nSo, the probability depends on two steps: first, Alice transfers a color X, then Bob transfers back color X. \n\nSince Alice's choice is random, and then Bob's choice depends on the current contents of his bag. \n\nSo, perhaps we can compute the probability by considering all possible cases for Alice's first transfer, then for each case, compute the probability that Bob transfers back the same color, then take the average over all cases. \n\nSince Alice's initial transfer is equally likely to be any of the 5 colors, and due to symmetry, the probability should be the same regardless of which color Alice transfers. Therefore, we can compute the probability for one color, say blue, and multiply by 1 (since they are all same). \n\nSo, let's fix Alice transferring a blue ball to Bob. Now Bob has 6 balls: his original 5 (including blue) plus Alice's blue. Therefore, Bob has two blue balls and one each of the other colors. \n\nWhen Bob selects a ball to transfer back, there are 6 balls. The chance he selects the blue ball that Alice gave him? Wait, but Bob has two blue balls. Are they distinguishable? \n\nHmm. Wait, the problem says each bag initially contains one ball of each color. So, when Alice transfers a blue ball to Bob, Bob's bag now has two blue balls. But since the balls are only distinguished by color, right? The problem doesn't mention different balls of the same color. So, when Bob picks a blue ball to transfer back, it doesn't matter which blue ball it is. So, the probability that Bob transfers back a blue ball is (number of blue balls in his bag)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nBut if Bob transfers back a blue ball, then Alice's bag gets back a blue ball, so both bags are back to original. \n\nTherefore, if Alice transfers color X, then Bob has a 2/6 = 1/3 chance to transfer back color X. \n\nTherefore, since Alice's initial transfer is arbitrary, the total probability is 1/3? \n\nWait, but let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to think about it. \n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as swapping a ball from Alice to Bob and then a ball from Bob to Alice. The question is whether the net result is that the balls have swapped. \n\nBut actually, if Alice sends a ball to Bob, and then Bob sends a ball back, there are different possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Bob sends back the same ball Alice sent. Then the net result is that the balls are back to original.\n\nCase 2: Bob sends back a different ball. Then Alice has lost one ball and gained a different one, and Bob has lost a different one and gained the original. Therefore, their bags are different from original. \n\nTherefore, the only way for the bags to be the same is Case 1. \n\nSo, the probability is the probability that Bob sends back the ball Alice sent. \n\nSo, since Alice sends one ball, then Bob has 6 balls, one of which is the one Alice sent. Therefore, the probability Bob sends back that specific ball is 1/6. \n\nWait, hold on! Earlier I thought there are two blue balls, so probability 2/6. But if the ball Alice sent is unique? Wait, no. If Alice sends a blue ball to Bob, Bob already had a blue ball. Therefore, there are two blue balls. But when Alice transfers a blue ball, it's one specific ball? Or are they considered the same?\n\nThis is a crucial point. \n\nIf the balls are distinguishable only by color, then when Alice transfers a blue ball to Bob, Bob's bag now has two blue balls. However, since they are indistinct except for color, when Bob picks a blue ball to transfer back, he could be transferring either the original one or Alice's one. However, transferring back a blue ball (either one) would result in Alice's bag having two blue balls? Wait no. Wait, let's track the counts. \n\nOriginal counts:\n\nAlice: 1 blue, 1 green, 1 orange, 1 red, 1 violet.\n\nBob: same.\n\nAfter Alice transfers a blue to Bob:\n\nAlice: 0 blue, 1 green, 1 orange, 1 red, 1 violet.\n\nBob: 2 blue, 1 green, 1 orange, 1 red, 1 violet.\n\nThen Bob transfers back a blue:\n\nAlice: 1 blue, 1 green, 1 orange, 1 red, 1 violet. (original)\n\nBob: 1 blue, 1 green, 1 orange, 1 red, 1 violet. (original)\n\nAlternatively, if Bob transfers back a non-blue ball, say green:\n\nAlice: 0 blue, 2 green, 1 orange, 1 red, 1 violet.\n\nBob: 2 blue, 0 green, 1 orange, 1 red, 1 violet.\n\nSo Alice's bag now has an extra green and is missing blue; Bob's bag is missing green and has an extra blue. Therefore, their bags are not the same as original. \n\nBut here's the thing: when Bob transfers back a blue ball, since there are two blue balls in his bag, but transferring either one doesn't change the fact that Alice gets a blue back. Since the balls are indistinct by color, the probability that Bob transfers back a blue is 2/6, as there are two blue balls. Therefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nBut earlier I thought maybe it's 1/6 because there's only one specific ball. But if the balls are considered indistinct by color, then there isn't a specific \"Alice's blue\" ball. Wait, but actually, maybe they are distinct objects. Wait, the problem says \"one ball of each of the colors\". So, maybe each color has one ball. So, if you have two blue balls, they are actually two distinct balls but same color. \n\nBut when Bob transfers a ball back, the color is what matters for the contents of the bag. Since the problem says \"the contents of the two bags are the same\". The contents are considered in terms of the multiset of colors. Therefore, whether Bob transfers back Alice's original blue or his original blue doesn't matter, as long as a blue is transferred back. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3, as there are two blue balls in Bob's bag. \n\nBut then earlier, I thought maybe it's 1/6 because there's only one specific ball that needs to be transferred back. But if the problem considers the contents as multisets of colors, then transferring back any blue is sufficient. Therefore, the probability is 1/3. \n\nBut let me think again. Suppose that instead of colors, we have numbers. Suppose Alice and Bob each have balls labeled 1 through 5. Alice picks one at random and gives to Bob. Then Bob picks one at random and gives back. What's the probability that the contents are same? In this case, the probability that Bob picks the same number that Alice gave him. \n\nIn this case, Bob has 6 balls: his original 5 and Alice's one. So the chance Bob picks Alice's specific ball is 1/6. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the probability would be 1/6. \n\nBut in our problem, the contents are considered in terms of color. So if the ball is considered by color, then transferring back any ball of the same color would suffice. \n\nBut here is the conflict. Depending on whether the balls are distinguishable or not. \n\nThe problem says \"the contents of the two bags are the same\". If \"contents\" refers to the multiset of colors, then transferring back a ball of the same color would make the contents same. However, if \"contents\" refers to the exact balls, then you have to transfer back the exact same ball. \n\nBut given that initially, each bag has one ball of each color, and the problem doesn't mention anything about the balls being distinguishable beyond their color, it's safe to assume that the contents are considered as multisets of colors. \n\nTherefore, in that case, if Alice transfers a blue to Bob, and Bob transfers back a blue, then both bags are back to original. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nBut then why does the number of colors matter? Wait, but in this case, regardless of which color Alice transfers, Bob will have two of that color, so the probability is always 2/6. Since Alice's choice is uniform over the 5 colors, but the probability for each color is same, so overall probability is 1/3. \n\nBut let me check with the alternative approach where balls are distinguishable. \n\nIf we think of each ball as unique, even within colors, then initially each has 5 unique balls. When Alice transfers a ball, say ball X, to Bob. Then Bob has 6 unique balls. The chance he transfers back ball X is 1/6. Therefore, the probability that the contents are same is 1/6. \n\nBut in this case, if Bob transfers back a different ball, say ball Y, then Alice's bag will have her original balls except X, plus Y; Bob's bag will have his original balls except Y, plus X. Therefore, the contents are different. \n\nBut here's a conflict between two interpretations. Which is correct?\n\nThe problem says \"the contents of the two bags are the same\". If the problem considers the contents as multisets of colors, then transferring back a same color is sufficient. If it considers the exact balls, then you need to transfer back the same ball. \n\nBut since the problem mentions colors, and each bag initially contains one ball of each color, it's likely that the problem is considering the contents in terms of colors. Therefore, if after the transfer, each bag still has one ball of each color, then they are same. \n\nBut let's think. Suppose Alice transfers a blue to Bob. Then Bob has two blues. If Bob transfers back a blue, then Alice gets a blue back, so her bag is back to one of each color. Bob's bag loses a blue, so he is back to one of each color. Therefore, contents same. \n\nIf Bob transfers back a non-blue, then Alice's bag has one less blue and one more of whatever Bob transferred back. Therefore, she has two of that color and zero blue. Bob has two blue and one less of that color. Therefore, contents not same. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1/3. \n\nBut let me check with actual enumeration. \n\nLet me take a simple case where there are only 2 colors, say blue and green. Each bag has one blue and one green. Let's compute the probability that after the transfer, the bags are same. \n\nOriginal: Alice has {B, G}; Bob has {B, G}.\n\nAlice transfers a random ball to Bob. Probability 1/2 for B or G. \n\nCase 1: Alice transfers B to Bob. Now Alice has {G}; Bob has {B, G, B}.\n\nBob transfers back a random ball. There are 3 balls: B, B, G. Probability of transferring back B is 2/3, G is 1/3.\n\nIf Bob transfers back B: Alice gets B, so her bag is {G, B} again; Bob's bag is {B, G} again. Same as original. \n\nIf Bob transfers back G: Alice's bag is {G, G}; Bob's is {B, B}. Not same as original. \n\nCase 2: Alice transfers G to Bob. Symmetric to case 1. Probability 2/3 to transfer back G, leading to original. \n\nTherefore, total probability is: (1/2 * 2/3) + (1/2 * 2/3) = 2/3. \n\nBut if we thought that it's 1/number of balls in Bob's bag, i.e., 1/3, then total probability would be 1/2*1/3 + ... = 1/3, but actual answer is 2/3. \n\nBut in this case, with two colors, the answer is 2/3. \n\nBut according to our previous logic, when there are n colors, when Alice transfers one color, Bob has two of that color, so probability is 2/(n + 1). Wait, in this case n=2 colors, Bob has 3 balls, so probability is 2/3. Which matches. In original problem, n=5 colors, so probability is 2/(5 + 1) = 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nTherefore, that seems to hold. Therefore, the answer is 1/3. \n\nBut let me check with another example. Let me take n=1 color. Each has 1 ball. Alice transfers to Bob, then Bob transfers back. What's the probability they are same? \n\nIf there's only 1 color, say blue. Each has 1 blue. Alice transfers her blue to Bob. Now Alice has 0, Bob has 2. Then Bob transfers one back: must be blue. So Alice gets blue back. So contents same. Probability 1. According to formula 2/(n + 1) with n=1: 2/2=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3 colors. Each has 3 colors. Probability should be 2/4=1/2. Let me check. \n\nAlice transfers one color. Bob has 2 of that color. Probability Bob transfers back that color is 2/4=1/2. So total probability is 1/2. \n\nTherefore, seems formula holds. Therefore, in original problem, answer is 2/(5 + 1)=1/3. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3. \n\nBut let me think again why there was confusion with distinguishable balls. If we think of balls as distinguishable, but the problem is about color contents, then even though there are two different blue balls, transferring either back would fix the contents. Therefore, the probability is number of blue balls over total balls. \n\nTherefore, answer is 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, another approach. \n\nLet me think about the entire process. \n\nWhat is the total number of possible ways this can happen? \n\nFirst, Alice can choose any of 5 balls. Then Bob can choose any of 6 balls. So total number of possible (Alice transfer, Bob transfer) pairs is 5*6=30. \n\nBut some of these result in same contents. \n\nHow many of these 30 possibilities result in the bags being same? \n\nFor each color that Alice transfers, there are 2 ways that Bob can transfer back that same color (if colors are considered as having multiple balls). Wait, but if the balls are distinguishable, then for each color Alice transfers, there is only 1 specific ball that needs to be transferred back. \n\nWait, confusion again. \n\nIf we think of balls as distinguishable, let's say each color has a unique ball. So there are 5 distinct balls in each bag. \n\nAlice transfers one of her 5 balls to Bob. Then Bob transfers one of his 6 balls back. \n\nTotal possibilities: 5*6=30. \n\nNow, how many of these result in the bags being same as original? \n\nFor that, Bob must transfer back the same ball that Alice transferred. Because if he transfers back any other ball, then Alice's bag will have her original balls minus one plus Bob's ball, which is different. \n\nTherefore, for each of the 5 possible balls Alice could transfer, there is exactly 1 ball Bob needs to transfer back (the same one). Since Bob has 6 balls, the probability is 1/6 for each case. \n\nTherefore, total number of successful outcomes is 5*1=5. \n\nTherefore, probability is 5/30=1/6. \n\nBut this contradicts our previous answer of 1/3. \n\nSo which is it? \n\nThis depends on the problem's definition of \"contents of the two bags are the same\". \n\nIf \"contents\" refers to the exact same set of balls (i.e., each ball is unique and must be present), then the answer is 1/6. \n\nIf \"contents\" refers to the multiset of colors (i.e., number of each color), then the answer is 1/3. \n\nThe problem says: \"the contents of the two bags are the same\". Since initially, each bag has one ball of each color. If after the transfers, each bag again has one ball of each color, then they are same. \n\nTherefore, if we think that the problem is referring to color counts, then answer is 1/3. \n\nBut let's check with the small case where n=2 colors. If contents are considered as color counts, then in that case, as we saw earlier, the probability was 2/3. If we do the same calculation with distinguishable balls: \n\nEach bag has 2 balls, say B1, G1 for Alice; B2, G2 for Bob. \n\nBut the problem says \"one ball of each of the colors\". Maybe the balls are not labeled with numbers, so they are indistinct except for color. \n\nTherefore, in that case, when Alice transfers a blue ball, it doesn't matter which blue; and when Bob transfers back a blue, it doesn't matter which. \n\nTherefore, in this case, considering colors, the probability is 2/3. \n\nHowever, if we consider the balls as distinct (for example, Alice's blue is different from Bob's blue), then transferring back any blue would not necessarily return the original balls. \n\nBut the problem says \"the contents of the two bags are the same\". If the contents are considered as sets of balls, and each blue is unique (i.e., Alice's blue is different from Bob's blue), then transferring back a blue would not make the contents same. \n\nWait, but initially, both have one blue. After Alice transfers her blue to Bob, Bob has two blues. If Bob transfers back his original blue to Alice, then Alice has her original blue back and Bob has his original blue. If Bob transfers back Alice's blue, then Alice has her blue back and Bob has his blue. Either way, the contents are same? \n\nWait, if we think of contents as the set of balls, then Alice's bag would have her original balls if she gets back her blue. But if Bob transfers back his original blue, then Alice's bag would have a blue that is not her original one. \n\nBut if the problem considers two bags as same if they have the same colors, regardless of which specific ball, then it's same. If it considers them as same only if they have the exact same balls, then it's different. \n\nBut the problem says \"the contents of the two bags are the same\". Since initially, they both have one of each color. If after the transfers, they again have one of each color, then contents are same. \n\nTherefore, the answer depends on the problem's definition. However, since the problem mentions colors and doesn't mention anything about the balls being unique or labeled, it's standard in probability puzzles to assume that when colors are mentioned and contents are compared, it's about the counts of colors. \n\nTherefore, in that case, the answer is 1/3. \n\nHowever, let's check literature or similar problems. For example, in problems where balls are transferred between urns, usually the focus is on the counts, not the specific balls. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1/3. \n\nBut let me think again with the distinguishable balls. Suppose we have two bags, each with one blue and one green. \n\nCase: Alice transfers her blue to Bob. Bob now has his blue, his green, and Alice's blue. \n\nIf Bob transfers back his blue to Alice: Alice now has her green and his blue. Bob has his green and Alice's blue. \n\nOriginal: Alice had her blue and green; Bob had his blue and green. \n\nAfter transfer: Alice has his blue and her green; Bob has his green and Alice's blue. \n\nSo the contents of the bags are different, because Alice has a different blue. \n\nBut if Bob transfers back Alice's blue: Alice gets her blue back, Bob has his blue and green. So contents same. \n\nTherefore, in this case, only when Bob transfers back the exact same ball that Alice transferred, the contents are same. Therefore, the probability is 1/3. \n\nWait, in this case, there are three balls in Bob's bag: his blue, his green, Alice's blue. \n\nProbability Bob transfers back Alice's blue is 1/3. Therefore, probability contents same is 1/3. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought about color counts, I thought it was 2/3. Where was my mistake?\n\nEarlier, I thought that transferring back any blue would suffice, but in reality, if the problem considers the contents as the exact balls, then transferring back the same ball is needed. However, if it considers color counts, then transferring back any blue suffices. \n\nBut in this example, if we consider color counts: \n\nAfter Alice transfers blue to Bob: Alice has 0 blue, 1 green. Bob has 2 blue, 1 green. \n\nIf Bob transfers back a blue, then Alice has 1 blue, 1 green. Bob has 1 blue, 1 green. Same color counts. \n\nIf Bob transfers back green, then Alice has 0 blue, 2 green. Bob has 2 blue, 0 green. Different color counts. \n\nTherefore, probability of transferring back blue is 2/3. Therefore, if considering color counts, probability is 2/3. \n\nBut if considering exact balls, probability is 1/3. \n\nBut the problem says \"the contents of the two bags are the same\". Which is it? \n\nThis is ambiguous, but in most probability problems involving colors and transfers, unless specified otherwise, it's usually about the counts. Therefore, the answer would be 2/3 in the two-color case. \n\nBut in reality, if you think about the physical contents, if you have two bags, and you swap a blue for a blue, the contents are same in terms of color composition. However, if you consider the actual physical balls, they might be different. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify that the balls are unique or labeled, it's safer to assume that it's about color composition. Therefore, in the two-color case, answer is 2/3. \n\nBut according to the distinguishable ball approach, where you need to transfer back the exact same ball, it's 1/3. \n\nSo which is the case here? \n\nLooking back to the original problem statement: \n\n\"Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors, blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?\"\n\nSince the problem mentions that each bag initially contains one ball of each color, and asks if after the transfers the contents are the same, it is referring to the multiset of colors in each bag. Therefore, if after the transfers, each bag again contains exactly one ball of each color, then they are the same. \n\nTherefore, in the two-color example, the answer would be 2/3, as transferring back a blue restores the color counts. \n\nTherefore, in the original problem with five colors, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nTherefore, answer is 1/3. \n\nBut then why does the distinguishable ball approach give a different answer? Because in that case, the problem would be interpreted as the bags having the exact same balls as before, which is a different question. \n\nTherefore, given the problem's wording, I think the answer is 1/3. \n\nHowever, to confirm, let's think of another angle. \n\nWhat is the probability that the overall transfer results in no net change? \n\nThis can happen in two ways: \n\n1. Alice transfers a ball to Bob, and Bob transfers the same ball back. \n\nOR \n\n2. Alice transfers a ball to Bob, and Bob transfers some other ball back, but then somehow the net effect cancels out. \n\nBut is there another way for the contents to be same? \n\nFor example, suppose Alice transfers a blue to Bob, and Bob transfers a green to Alice. Then Alice's bag loses blue and gains green; Bob's bag loses green and gains blue. So they have swapped a blue and a green. Therefore, their bags are not same as original, but they have swapped two balls. However, since each had one of each color, swapping two different colors would make their bags different. \n\nTherefore, only way for bags to be same is if Bob transfers back the same color that Alice transferred. \n\nTherefore, in general, the probability is: \n\nFor each color, probability Alice transfers that color times probability Bob transfers back that color. \n\nSince all colors are symmetric, it's equal to probability for one color times 1. \n\nSo, probability Alice transfers color X is 1/5. Given that, probability Bob transfers back color X is (number of X in Bob's bag)/6 = 2/6. \n\nTherefore, total probability is 1/5 * 2/6 * 5 = 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nYes! Because there are 5 colors, each with probability 1/5, multiplied by 2/6, then summed over all 5 colors. The 1/5 and 5 cancel out, leaving 2/6=1/3. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/3. \n\nBut let me check with the two-color case again with this formula. \n\nn=2 colors. Probability would be 1/2 * 2/3 * 2 = 2/3. Which matches our previous result. \n\nTherefore, this formula seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 1/3. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.\n</think>"}
