A key requirement for tautomerism is the presence of an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n- **Benzoquinone** is a conjugated 1,4-benzoquinone, with two carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1 and 4 in a benzene ring. These carbonyl groups are conjugated with alternating double bonds. However, **benzoquinone lacks alpha hydrogens** due to the fully conjugated and substituted ring structure. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** is a cyclic compound with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 in a six-membered ring. The positions between the ketones (2, 4, and 6) contain carbon atoms with **alpha hydrogens**. These hydrogens can move between the carbonyl groups, leading to tautomerism. Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule contains one or more chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). A chiral center leads to non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its structure is CH₃–CH(OH)–COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a **chiral center**, and the molecule **exhibits optical isomerism**.\n\n- **Dimethyl fumarate** is a trans isomer of dimethyl maleate. Its structure is trans-CH₂=CH–COOCH₃ with the two COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond. The central atoms in the double bond (each carbon) are not chiral centers because they are not connected to four different substituents.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The user has two parts: part A and part B.\n\nFor part A, they want to know which compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where compounds can interconvert by the movement of a proton and the rearrangement of bonds. The most common example is keto-enol tautomerism. So, I need to figure out if either of these compounds can undergo tautomerism.\n\nBenzoquinone is a compound with two ketone groups (C=O) in a benzene ring. The structure is 1,4-benzoquinone, which is a conjugated diene with alternating double bonds. Tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen atom and shifting double bonds or carbonyl groups. But in benzoquinone, the structure is already a conjugated system with alternating double bonds and oxygen atoms. I'm not sure if it can tautomerize because there might not be a hydrogen that can move to form a different structure. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic compound with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a cyclic form, and I think this might be able to tautomerize into a different structure, maybe a hydroxy form. But wait, tautomerism requires a hydrogen that can be moved. If the ketone groups are adjacent, maybe there's a hydrogen between them that can move. However, in a trione (three ketones), maybe the structure is such that there's no hydrogen available for tautomerism. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. In a typical ketone, like acetone, the alpha hydrogen can move to form an enol. But in a trione, if all the positions have carbonyl groups, maybe there are no hydrogens left to move. So perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't undergo tautomerism because there are no hydrogens available for the process. If that's the case, then the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize into something else. Wait, benzoquinone is a stable compound and I don't think it tautomerizes. Maybe the trione can tautomerize into a different structure. Hmm.\n\nFor part B, the question is about optical isomerism. The compounds given are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning a carbon atom with four different groups attached. Let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid, which has the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the propanoic acid chain. So the structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, the propanoic acid has three carbons. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The middle carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) has four different groups: a CH3, an OH, a COOCH3, and a CH2 group. Wait, no. Wait, the propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so CH3-CHOH-COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to a CH3, an OH, a COOCH3, and a CH2 group. Wait, actually, the central carbon is CH(OH), so the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a CH2 group? Wait, no. Let me draw this out. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoic acid part is CH2CH2COOH. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon, so it's CH3-CHOH-COOH. The methyl ester would replace the -OH in the carboxylic acid with an -OCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to a CH3 group (from the left), an OH group, a COOCH3 group (from the right), and a CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, the central carbon is the one between the CH3 and the COOCH3. So it's CH(OH) between CH3 and COOCH3. Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to: a CH3 group (left), an OH group (up), a COOCH3 group (right), and a hydrogen (down)? Wait, no. Wait, the propanoic acid chain is CH3-CH2-COOH. When there's a hydroxyl on the second carbon, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOH. Then the methyl ester is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to: a CH3 group (from the left), an OH group (on the central carbon), a COOCH3 group (from the right), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon is the one with the hydroxyl. So the groups attached to that carbon are: CH3 (from the left), OH (on the carbon), COOCH3 (from the right), and a hydrogen? Wait, but that would make four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. If that's the case, then the central carbon is a chiral center, so the molecule can show optical isomerism. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have optical isomerism.\n\nNow, for dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH-COOCH3 and the other side is COOCH3. Wait, no. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of dimethyl maleate. So, the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 and the other side is COOCH3? Wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=CH-COOCH3 and the other COOCH3 is on the opposite side. Wait, fumaric acid is trans, so the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified with methanol, dimethyl fumarate would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, can this show optical isomerism? Optical isomerism requires a chiral center. In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 with the other COOCH3 on the opposite side. Wait, the central carbons are CH2 and CH. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 with the other COOCH3 on the other CH? Wait, no. The correct structure is that the double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-COOCH3 with the other COOCH3 on the other CH. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is trans-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. So, when esterified, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH-COOCH3 with the other COOCH3 on the trans side. The molecule has a double bond with two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. Now, does this have a chiral center? Let's see. The central atoms are the two carbons in the double bond. For optical isomerism, the molecule needs to have a chiral center, which is a carbon with four different groups. In dimethyl fumarate, the two carbons of the double bond each have two groups: one is a CH2COOCH3 and the other is a COOCH3. Wait, but the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 with the other COOCH3 on the opposite side. Let me try to draw it properly. The structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 and the other COOCH3 is on the other CH. Wait, no. The correct structure is that the double bond is between two CH groups, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 with the other COOCH3 on the other CH. Wait, but that would mean each CH group is connected to a COOCH3. However, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So each CH group is connected to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, trans configuration. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2=CH-COOCH3 with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. The structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 with the other COOCH3 on the opposite side of the double bond. Now, looking at the two carbons in the double bond: each has a CH2COOCH3 group and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let's take the first carbon in the double bond: it's connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. The second carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the structure. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is that the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a trans configuration. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? A chiral center requires a carbon with four different substituents. In dimethyl fumarate, the two carbons in the double bond each have two substituents: one is a COOCH3 group and the other is a CH2 group. But since it's a double bond, each carbon is connected to two groups. The other groups are the double bond itself. Wait, no. The two carbons in the double bond each have two substituents. For example, the left carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group, and the right carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. But since the double bond is between them, each carbon has two substituents. However, in reality, the two carbons in the double bond are each connected to two different groups. For example, the left carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and the right carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. But in the trans configuration, the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. However, there's no chiral center here because each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups (a COOCH3 and a CH2 group). Wait, no. The left carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. The CH2 group is part of the other carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. The molecule is symmetrical in a way that there's no carbon with four different groups. Therefore, it cannot show optical isomerism. Therefore, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, the one that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate because it has a chiral center.\n\nSo for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nPart A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Because benzoquinone can tautomerize? Or is it the other way around? Let me recheck. Benzoquinone is a stable compound with a conjugated system. Tautomerism requires the movement of a proton. In benzoquinone, there are no alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can move. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups in the benzene ring. The structure is 1,4-benzoquinone. The positions 1 and 4 are carbonyl groups. The other positions (2,3,5,6) are double bonds. There are no hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups that can be moved. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic compound with three ketone groups. If there are hydrogens between the ketone groups, maybe there can be tautomerism. For example, between the 1 and 3 positions, there's a carbon that could have a hydrogen. If that hydrogen can move, maybe forming a hydroxy group and shifting the double bonds. However, in a trione (three ketones), perhaps there are no hydrogens available for tautomerism. Wait, if the structure is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then the ring has three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. The other positions (2,4,6) would have carbons. Let's say position 2 is between 1 and 3. If position 2 has a hydrogen, then maybe that hydrogen can move to form a hydroxy group and shift the double bonds. However, if all the positions adjacent to the ketone groups have no hydrogens because they are already part of the ring, then maybe there's no tautomerism. Alternatively, if there are hydrogens, then tautomerism is possible. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of an example. For example, in a diketone like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, there are alpha hydrogens between the two ketone groups. These can undergo tautomerism to form a hydroxy group. But in a trione (three ketones), if all the positions between the ketones have no hydrogens because they are part of the ring structure, then there might not be any alpha hydrogens. For example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the positions 1,3,5 have ketones. The positions 2,4,6 would be between the ketones. If each of these positions is a carbon that is part of the ring, then maybe there are no hydrogens. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and two hydrogens. However, in a trione, the carbons at positions 1,3,5 have double bonds to oxygen. The other positions (2,4,6) would have single bonds to adjacent carbons and hydrogens. For example, position 2 is between 1 and 3. It has a single bond to position 1 and a single bond to position 3. Since position 1 and 3 are ketones, position 2 would be a carbon connected to two other carbons (positions 1 and 3) and two hydrogens. So, position 2 has two hydrogens. Therefore, there are alpha hydrogens between the ketone groups. In that case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism by moving one of these hydrogens to form a hydroxy group and shifting the double bonds. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, while benzoquinone cannot. Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So for part A, the answer is benzoquinone. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nPart A: A = benzoquinone (does not show tautomerism)\n\nPart B: B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism)\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Which corresponds to option B in the given choices.\n</think>"}
