The charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign—each is 4.0 nC, and they're separated by 2.0 cm. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that an electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance. The electric field at a point due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law, right? So, the electric field E from a point charge is E = k * |q| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²), q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge to the point where we're calculating the field.\n\nSince we have two charges here, I need to calculate the electric field from each charge at the midpoint and then add them vectorially. But wait, because they are opposite charges, the direction of their electric fields at the midpoint might be the same or opposite? Let me visualize this.\n\nLet me sketch a diagram in my mind. Suppose the positive charge is on the left and the negative on the right. The midpoint is exactly halfway between them. The electric field from the positive charge would point away from it, so to the right at the midpoint. The electric field from the negative charge would point toward it, so also to the right at the midpoint. Wait, so both fields are in the same direction? That seems odd because I thought in a dipole, the fields might cancel in some regions. But at the midpoint between a positive and a negative charge, maybe they add up?\n\nWait, let me make sure. The positive charge's electric field direction is away from it. If I'm at the midpoint between a positive and a negative charge, then the positive charge's field would be pointing towards the negative charge? No, wait. If the positive is on the left and the negative on the right, then the electric field from the positive charge at the midpoint is to the right (away from positive), and the electric field from the negative charge at the midpoint is to the left (towards the negative). Wait, no, hold on. If the negative charge is on the right, then the electric field at the midpoint due to the negative charge would be towards the negative charge, so to the right? Wait, no. Let me get this straight.\n\nElectric field direction: For a positive charge, the electric field lines go outwards. So, at a point between the positive and negative charges, the field from the positive charge would be pointing to the right (away from the positive charge, towards the negative). For the negative charge, the electric field lines go inwards. So at the midpoint, the electric field due to the negative charge would be pointing towards it, which is to the left? Wait, if the negative charge is on the right, then towards it is to the right. Wait, no. If the midpoint is halfway between them, then from the midpoint to the negative charge is towards the right. So the electric field due to the negative charge at the midpoint is towards the negative charge, which is to the right. Wait, that would mean both fields are pointing in the same direction? That can't be right because then the fields would add up. But intuitively, between a positive and a negative charge, the electric fields should be in the same direction? Wait, let's take a concrete example.\n\nImagine two charges, +q and -q, separated by distance d. At the midpoint between them, the electric field due to +q is directed away from +q, so towards the -q. The electric field due to -q is directed towards -q, so also towards the -q. Therefore, both fields are in the same direction at the midpoint. Therefore, their magnitudes add up. Therefore, the total electric field is the sum of the two individual fields. Wait, but then why is there an option of zero here? Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again. Suppose the positive charge is on the left, negative on the right. Midpoint is in the center. Electric field from positive charge at midpoint: direction is to the right (away from +). Electric field from negative charge at midpoint: direction is to the left (towards -). Wait, now I'm confused. If the negative charge is on the right, then the electric field at the midpoint due to the negative charge is towards the negative charge, which is to the right. Wait, no. The midpoint is halfway between them. So if the negative charge is on the right, then from the midpoint to the negative charge is to the right. Therefore, the electric field direction due to the negative charge at the midpoint is towards the negative charge, which is to the right. So both fields are pointing to the right? Then they add up. But if the positive charge is on the left, then its field at the midpoint is to the right. The negative charge's field is also to the right. So total field is E1 + E2.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Then why do I have a conflicting thought? Maybe because in a dipole, the field at the center is zero? No, wait, a dipole is two equal and opposite charges. But if you are along the axis of the dipole, between the charges, the fields add up. Whereas if you are on the perpendicular bisector, then they cancel? Wait, maybe I need to recall the formula for electric field of a dipole.\n\nThe electric field of a dipole along its axis (end-on position) is given by E = (1/(4πε0))*(2p/d³), where p is the dipole moment (qd), and d is the distance from the center of the dipole. Whereas on the perpendicular bisector (broadside position), the electric field is zero? Wait, no, actually on the perpendicular bisector, the electric field is non-zero but has a different direction.\n\nWait, but in our case, the midpoint is along the axis of the dipole. So according to the formula, the electric field should be non-zero. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe dipole moment p is q*d, where d is the separation between the charges. Wait, but in the formula for the electric field along the axis, it's E = (1/(4πε0))*(2p)/r³, where r is the distance from the center of the dipole to the point where we are calculating the field. Wait, but in our case, the point is at the midpoint between the charges. Wait, so if the separation between the charges is 2a, then the distance from the center of the dipole to the midpoint is zero? Wait, no. The midpoint between the charges is the same as the center of the dipole. Wait, if the separation between the charges is d, then the midpoint is at distance d/2 from each charge. But if we are calculating the electric field at the midpoint, then according to the dipole formula, if we take r approaching zero? Wait, maybe that formula is for points far away from the dipole, not at the midpoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just calculate the fields from each charge individually and add them up.\n\nSo let's do that. The charges are +4.0 nC and -4.0 nC, separated by 2.0 cm. The midpoint is 1.0 cm from each charge.\n\nSo first, convert all units to SI units. The charges are 4.0 × 10^-9 C. The distance from each charge to the midpoint is 0.01 m.\n\nElectric field from each charge at the midpoint:\n\nE_positive = k * q / r²\n\nE_negative = k * |q| / r²\n\nSince both charges are equal in magnitude, the magnitudes of their electric fields at the midpoint are equal. But as discussed earlier, their directions?\n\nIf the positive charge is on the left, then E_positive at midpoint points to the right (away from +). The negative charge is on the right, so E_negative at midpoint points to the right (towards -). Therefore, both fields are in the same direction. Therefore, total electric field is E_total = E_positive + E_negative = 2 * (k * q / r²)\n\nWait, but if they are in the same direction, then adding them makes sense. So let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let me calculate E_positive:\n\nk = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²\n\nq = 4.0 × 10^-9 C\n\nr = 0.01 m\n\nE_positive = (8.99e9) * (4.0e-9) / (0.01)^2\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute numerator: 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9 = 8.99 * 4.0 * 10^(9-9) = 35.96 * 1 = 35.96 N·m²/C\n\nDenominator: (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 m²\n\nSo E_positive = 35.96 / 0.0001 = 35.96 / 1e-4 = 35.96 × 10^4 N/C = 3.596 × 10^5 N/C\n\nSimilarly, E_negative is the same magnitude, so total E_total = 2 * 3.596 × 10^5 ≈ 7.192 × 10^5 N/C\n\nLooking at the options, D is 7.2 × 10^5 N/C. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me check again if the directions are correct.\n\nWait, if the positive charge is on the left, the electric field from the positive charge at the midpoint is to the right. The electric field from the negative charge at the midpoint is to the right as well? Because the negative charge's field points toward it, which is to the right (since it's on the right side). Therefore, both fields add up. So total E is indeed twice the single field. Therefore, approximately 7.2 × 10^5 N/C. So answer D.\n\nBut let me check if I made any calculation errors.\n\nCalculating E_positive again:\n\nk = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²\n\nq = 4.0 × 10^-9 C\n\nr = 0.01 m\n\nE = (8.99 × 10^9) * (4.0 × 10^-9) / (0.01)^2\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n(8.99 × 4.0) × 10^(9 - 9) = 35.96 × 10^0 = 35.96\n\nDenominator:\n\n(0.01)^2 = 0.0001 = 1 × 10^-4\n\nSo E = 35.96 / 1 × 10^-4 = 35.96 × 10^4 = 3.596 × 10^5 N/C ≈ 3.6 × 10^5 N/C per charge.\n\nMultiply by 2: 7.192 × 10^5 ≈ 7.2 × 10^5 N/C. So yes, answer D.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Sometimes in dipole problems, the formula for the electric field at the center is different. Let me recall. The electric field of a dipole at a point on the axis, at a distance r from the center, is given by:\n\nE = [1/(4πε0)] * [2p / r³]\n\nBut in this case, the point is at the midpoint between the charges, which is also the center of the dipole. So if r is the distance from the center to the point, then r is zero? Wait, but that would make E go to infinity, which doesn't make sense. So clearly, that formula is for points far away from the dipole, where r >> d (the separation between charges). When r approaches zero, we can't use that formula. So in this case, we need to calculate the fields from each charge individually.\n\nSo our previous approach is correct. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check once again. Suppose I have +q and -q separated by distance d. Midpoint is at d/2 from each. The electric field from +q is kq/(d/2)^2 pointing towards -q. The electric field from -q is kq/(d/2)^2 pointing towards -q as well. Therefore, total E = 2 * [kq/(d/2)^2] = 2 * [4kq/d²] = 8kq/d².\n\nLet me compute that with numbers:\n\nk = 8.99e9, q = 4.0e-9 C, d = 0.02 m (since separation is 2.0 cm).\n\nSo E_total = 8 * 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9 / (0.02)^2\n\nCompute numerator: 8 * 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9 = 8 * 8.99 * 4.0 * 10^(9-9) = 8 * 35.96 * 1 = 287.68\n\nDenominator: (0.02)^2 = 0.0004 m² = 4 × 10^-4 m²\n\nSo E_total = 287.68 / 4 × 10^-4 = 71.92 / 10^-4 = 71.92 × 10^4 = 7.192 × 10^5 N/C. Same result as before. Therefore, answer D.\n\nBut wait, why does this formula 8kq/d² differ from the dipole formula? Because the dipole formula is for points along the axis but at a distance r from the center where r >> d. Here, the point is at r = 0, so we can't use that formula. Our direct calculation is correct here.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think: if the two charges are +q and -q separated by d, then the electric field at the midpoint is E = E_+ + E_-.\n\nSince each field is kq/(d/2)^2 and they are in the same direction, so E_total = 2 * [kq/( (d/2)^2 ) ] = 2 * [4kq/d²] = 8kq/d². Which is what we have.\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\nk = 8.99e9 N·m²/C²\n\nq = 4.0e-9 C\n\nd = 0.02 m\n\nE_total = 8 * 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9 / (0.02)^2\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst compute 8 * 4.0e-9 = 3.2e-8\n\nMultiply by 8.99e9: 3.2e-8 * 8.99e9 = 3.2 * 8.99 * 10^( -8 + 9 ) = 28.768 * 10^1 = 287.68\n\nDenominator is (0.02)^2 = 0.0004 = 4.0e-4\n\nSo E_total = 287.68 / 4.0e-4 = 287.68 / 0.0004 = 719,200 N/C ≈ 7.19 × 10^5 N/C ≈ 7.2 × 10^5 N/C. So answer D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any chance that the fields cancel? For example, if the charges were both positive or both negative, then at the midpoint, their fields would be in opposite directions and cancel. But since they are opposite charges, their fields at the midpoint are in the same direction, so they add up. Hence, the total field is not zero. Therefore, option A is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D:7.2 × 10^5 N/C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
