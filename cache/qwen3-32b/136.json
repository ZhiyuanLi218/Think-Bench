The total they got was 1986, but they added one of the numbers twice. The pages are numbered from 1 through n. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1)/2. So normally, if there were no mistakes, the sum should be that. But in this case, someone added a number twice, so the incorrect sum is 1986. Therefore, the difference between the incorrect sum and the correct sum should be equal to the page number that was added twice. Wait, but actually, since they added a number twice, the incorrect sum is equal to the correct sum plus the duplicated number. Let me write that down:\n\nIncorrect sum = Correct sum + duplicated number.\n\nTherefore, if I can figure out what the correct sum should be, I can subtract it from 1986 to find the duplicated number. But here's the problem: I don't know n. So I need to figure out n first.\n\nSo, the first step is to find n such that the correct sum is slightly less than 1986. Because if you add an extra number, the incorrect sum is 1986. Therefore, the correct sum should be less than 1986 by the duplicated number. Since the duplicated number is at least 1 and at most n, the correct sum must be between 1986 - n and 1986 - 1. But how do I find n?\n\nLet me think. Let me denote S(n) = n(n + 1)/2. Then we know that S(n) < 1986 < S(n) + n. Because adding the duplicated number (which is at most n) to S(n) gives 1986. Therefore, S(n) < 1986 < S(n) + n. So we can use this inequality to find n.\n\nSo, let me solve S(n) < 1986 < S(n) + n.\n\nFirst, approximate n. Since S(n) ≈ n²/2, so n²/2 ≈ 1986 => n² ≈ 3972 => n ≈ sqrt(3972). Let me calculate sqrt(3972). Well, 63² is 3969, which is very close. 63*63=3969. Therefore, sqrt(3972) ≈ 63. So n is probably 63. Let's check S(63) = 63*64/2 = 2016. Wait, but 2016 is already larger than 1986. Hmm, so maybe n is 62?\n\nLet me check S(62) = 62*63/2 = 1953. Then S(62) + 62 = 1953 + 62 = 2015. But the incorrect sum is 1986, which is between 1953 and 2015. So yes, n is 62. Because S(62) is 1953, and adding a duplicated number (which is between 1 and 62) would result in a total between 1954 and 2015. Since 1986 is in that range, n must be 62.\n\nSo the correct sum should be 1953, and the incorrect sum is 1986. Therefore, the duplicated number is 1986 - 1953 = 33. Therefore, the answer is 33?\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If n is 62, then correct sum is 1953. If someone added a number twice, then incorrect sum is 1953 + x = 1986, so x is 1986 - 1953 = 33. So the duplicated number is 33. But let me verify that n is indeed 62. Let me check S(62) = 62*63/2. 62 divided by 2 is 31, so 31*63. Let me compute that. 30*63=1890, 1*63=63, total is 1953. Yes, that's correct. Then 1953 + 33 is 1986. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if n could be 63. If n=63, the correct sum is 63*64/2 = 2016. Then if someone added a number twice, the incorrect sum would be 2016 + x. But 2016 is already bigger than 1986. So 2016 + x would be even bigger. But the incorrect sum is 1986, which is less than 2016. Therefore, n can't be 63. Therefore, n must be 62, and duplicated number is 33. Therefore, the answer is 33. But let me check again.\n\nWait, but if n is 62, then the pages are numbered up to 62. Therefore, the duplicated number must be between 1 and 62. 33 is in that range. So that seems okay.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming n is 62? Let me check with another approach. Let me suppose that the incorrect sum is 1986. The correct sum is S(n) = n(n+1)/2, and incorrect sum is S(n) + x = 1986, where x is between 1 and n. Therefore, S(n) = 1986 - x. Since x is between 1 and n, then S(n) must be between 1986 - n and 1986 - 1. Therefore, we can write:\n\n1986 - n ≤ S(n) < 1986.\n\nBut S(n) = n(n + 1)/2. Therefore, we can write:\n\n1986 - n ≤ n(n + 1)/2 < 1986.\n\nSo let me solve the inequalities:\n\nFirst, n(n + 1)/2 < 1986.\n\nWe saw that for n=62, S(n)=1953 < 1986. For n=63, S(n)=2016 > 1986. So the first inequality n(n + 1)/2 < 1986 holds for n=62 and below. The second inequality is 1986 - n ≤ S(n). For n=62, 1986 - 62 = 1924. S(n)=1953. 1953 ≥ 1924. So yes, holds. For n=63, 1986 - 63 = 1923. S(n)=2016 ≥ 1923. But since for n=63, the first inequality fails (2016 < 1986 is false). Therefore, only n=62 satisfies both inequalities.\n\nTherefore, n=62. Therefore, S(n)=1953. Therefore, duplicated number is 1986 - 1953 = 33. Therefore, answer is 33. But let me check once more. Let me check if adding 33 twice would result in 1986. Suppose the correct sum is 1953. Then adding 33 again, total is 1953 + 33 = 1986. Correct. So yes, seems okay.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible n? For example, if n is higher? Wait, for n=63, correct sum is 2016, which is higher than 1986. If someone added a page number twice, then incorrect sum would be 2016 + x, but that's even higher. Therefore, can't be. If n is lower, say n=61. Let's check. S(61)=61*62/2= 61*31= 1891. Then incorrect sum would be 1891 + x = 1986. Therefore, x= 1986 - 1891= 95. But if n=61, the maximum page number is 61, so x=95 is impossible. Therefore, n cannot be 61. Similarly, for n=62, x=33 is okay. Therefore, n=62 is the correct value. Therefore, answer is 33.\n\nBut let me check once again with another method. Suppose that the incorrect sum is 1986. Let me assume that n is 62. Let me compute the correct sum is 1953. Then difference is 1986 - 1953 = 33. Since 33 is between 1 and 62, it is a valid page number. Therefore, answer is 33. Seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to set up an equation. Let me try.\n\nLet me denote that the correct sum is S = n(n + 1)/2. The incorrect sum is S + x = 1986, where x is the duplicated number. Also, x ≤ n. Therefore, S = 1986 - x. But S = n(n + 1)/2. Therefore, n(n + 1)/2 = 1986 - x. Since x is between 1 and n, then 1986 - n ≤ n(n + 1)/2 ≤ 1986 - 1.\n\nTherefore, solving for n:\n\nn(n + 1)/2 + 1 ≤ 1986 ≤ n(n + 1)/2 + n.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nn(n + 1)/2 + 1 ≤ 1986 ≤ [n(n + 1)/2] + n.\n\nSimplify the upper bound:\n\n[n(n + 1)/2] + n = [n(n + 1) + 2n]/2 = [n² + n + 2n]/2 = [n² + 3n]/2.\n\nTherefore, 1986 is between n(n + 1)/2 + 1 and (n² + 3n)/2.\n\nBut perhaps another way is better. Since we know that n(n + 1)/2 ≈ 1986 - x. Since x is relatively small compared to 1986, we can approximate n(n + 1)/2 ≈ 1986. Therefore, solving n² ≈ 3972. As before, sqrt(3972) ≈ 63. Therefore, testing n=63 gives S=2016. Which is larger than 1986. So then 1986 - S = -30. But since S = 1986 - x, so -30 = -x => x=30? Wait, no. Wait, if S(n) = 1986 - x. If n=63, S(n)=2016. Therefore, 2016 = 1986 - x => x = 1986 - 2016 = -30. Which is impossible, since x is positive. Therefore, n cannot be 63. If n=62, S(n)=1953=1986 - x => x=33. Which works. If n=61, S(n)= 61*62/2= 1891=1986 - x => x= 1986 - 1891=95. Which is higher than n=61, impossible. Therefore, only n=62 gives x=33 which is valid. Therefore, answer is 33.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 33. But let me check once again with actual calculation.\n\nCompute S(62) = 62*63/2. 62 divided by 2 is 31. 31*63. Let me compute 30*63=1890, plus 1*63=63, total 1953. Correct. Then 1986 - 1953 = 33. Yes. And 33 is between 1 and 62, so valid. Therefore, the duplicated number is 33. Therefore, the answer is 33.\n\nBut just to make sure there isn't a trick here. For example, is there another n where S(n) is such that 1986 - S(n) is between 1 and n? Let me check n=60. S(60)= 60*61/2= 1830. Then 1986 - 1830=156. Which is more than 60, invalid. n=61, 1986 - 1891=95>61. n=62, 33<62, okay. n=63, gives negative. How about n=64? S(64)= 64*65/2= 2080. Then 1986 - 2080= -94. No. So no. Therefore, only n=62. Therefore, answer is 33.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 33. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe page number that was added twice is \\boxed{33}.\n</think>"}
