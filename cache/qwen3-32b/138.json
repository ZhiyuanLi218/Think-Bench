Both are diatomic molecules, and the key to understanding their physical properties lies in the nature of **intermolecular forces**, particularly **London dispersion forces**.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Boiling Point Trend\n\nBoiling points are directly related to the strength of **intermolecular forces**—the attractive forces between molecules in the liquid state. For nonpolar molecules like Br₂ and I₂, the only intermolecular forces present are **London dispersion forces**, which arise from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution that create instantaneous dipoles.\n\nThe strength of these forces depends on two primary factors:\n1. **Molecular size and mass**: Larger molecules tend to have higher boiling points due to increased mass.\n2. **Electron cloud polarizability**: Larger molecules have more electrons and more diffuse electron clouds, making them more **polarizable**. This increases the strength of London dispersion forces.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n- **Option A**: *Bromine is a liquid and boils; iodine is a solid and sublimes.*  \n  While this is a true statement, it doesn't explain the **difference in boiling points**. Sublimation and boiling are distinct processes, and the given boiling point of iodine (184°C) is valid under normal pressure. This option is **not the best explanation**.\n\n- **Option B**: *The intramolecular bonds in I₂ are much weaker than those in Br₂.*  \n  This is incorrect. **Intramolecular bonds** (covalent bonds between atoms in a molecule) are not relevant to the boiling point. Boiling involves overcoming **intermolecular forces**, not breaking chemical bonds. This option is **irrelevant**.\n\n- **Option C**: *The I₂ electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br₂ electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.*  \n  This is the **correct and most complete explanation**. Iodine has a larger atomic radius and more electrons than bromine, making its electron cloud more easily distorted. This **increased polarizability** results in **stronger London dispersion forces**, which require more energy to overcome—hence the **higher boiling point**.\n\n- **Option D**: *The mass of iodine is much greater than the mass of bromine.*  \n  While molecular mass does contribute to boiling point, it's **not the primary factor** in this case. The **difference in polarizability** is more significant in explaining the **large jump in boiling point** from 59°C (Br₂) to 184°C (I₂). So, this is a **partial explanation** but **not the best**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most accurate and comprehensive explanation for the large difference in boiling points between bromine and iodine is the **greater polarizability of iodine's electron cloud**, leading to **stronger London dispersion forces**. This directly affects the energy required to separate the molecules during boiling.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about why iodine has a much higher boiling point than bromine. Both are diatomic molecules, right? I remember that boiling points have to do with intermolecular forces. So, even though iodine is a solid at room temperature and bromine is a liquid, the key here is the strength of the forces between the molecules when they're in the liquid state.\n\nBromine boils at 59°C and iodine at 184°C. The atomic radius for iodine is bigger than bromine. So, iodine is a larger molecule. I think larger molecules have more electrons, which means their electron clouds are more polarizable. Polarizability affects London dispersion forces, which are a type of intermolecular force. The more polarizable the electron cloud, the stronger the London forces, leading to higher boiling points.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Bromine is a liquid and boils; iodine is a solid and sublimes. Hmm, but the question is about boiling points. If iodine sublimes, does that mean it doesn't boil? But the given boiling point for iodine is 184°C. Maybe under normal pressure, it sublimes, but when it does boil, it's still higher. Not sure if this is the best reason.\n\nB: Intramolecular bonds in I2 are weaker. Wait, intramolecular bonds are the covalent bonds within the I2 molecule. If those were weaker, maybe the molecule would break apart more easily, but boiling is about overcoming intermolecular forces, not breaking the molecule. So this might be a distractor.\n\nC: I2 electron clouds are more polarizable, leading to stronger London forces. That fits with what I was thinking earlier. Larger atoms have more electrons, so more dispersion forces. Since iodine is bigger, its electron cloud is easier to distort, creating temporary dipoles which attract other molecules. Stronger intermolecular forces mean higher boiling point. This seems right.\n\nD: Mass of iodine is greater. Well, mass does play a role because larger molecules have higher molar masses, and that can contribute to higher boiling points. But the question is asking for the best reason. The atomic mass difference is part of it, but the main factor here is the polarizability leading to stronger London forces. Because mass alone might not explain the large difference. For example, if two molecules have similar polarizability, then mass might matter more, but in this case, since iodine is much larger, the increased polarizability is the key. So C is better than D.\n\nSo the answer should be C. Let me check again. The question says the I2 molecule is much larger than Br2. Larger size means more electrons, more polarizable, so stronger London forces. That's why iodine has a higher boiling point. So C is correct. The other options don't address the intermolecular forces directly. D is partially true, but the reason is more about the nature of the forces rather than just mass. So C is the best answer.\n</think>"}
