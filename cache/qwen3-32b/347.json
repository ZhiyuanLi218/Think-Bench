So, the question is about comparing the orbital radius of a spacecraft around Mars to that of a geosynchronous satellite on Earth. Both have orbital periods of 2 days, but Mars has a mass that's 0.1 times Earth's mass. The options are given as cube roots of various numbers, so I need to derive the ratio using orbital mechanics.\n\nFirst, I remember that the orbital period of a satellite depends on the mass of the planet it's orbiting and the radius of its orbit. The formula that relates these is Kepler's third law, which for circular orbits can be written as:\n\nT² = (4π²/GM) * r³\n\nWhere T is the period, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the orbital radius. So if I rearrange this formula to solve for r, it would be:\n\nr³ = (GMT²)/(4π²)\n\nBut since we're dealing with ratios between two different scenarios (Mars spacecraft and Earth geosynchronous satellite), maybe I can set up a ratio of their radii. Let me denote the Mars spacecraft's orbital radius as r_m and the Earth satellite's as r_e. Similarly, their periods are T_m and T_e, and their planetary masses are M_m and M_e.\n\nGiven that the period for both is 2 days. Wait, the problem says the spacecraft around Mars has a period of 2 Martian days, and since one Martian day is approximately one Earth day, that means T_m = 2 Earth days. Similarly, a geosynchronous satellite on Earth has a period of 1 Earth day, right? Because geosynchronous means it orbits once per Earth day, so it stays above the same spot. Wait, but the problem says the spacecraft's period is 2 Martian days, which is approximately 2 Earth days. And the geosynchronous satellite's period is 1 Earth day. So T_m = 2*T_e, where T_e is 1 day.\n\nBut let me confirm: the geosynchronous satellite has a period equal to Earth's rotation period, which is 1 Earth day. The Mars spacecraft has a period of 2 Martian days, which is roughly 2 Earth days. So T_m = 2*T_e.\n\nBut let me make sure. The problem says \"knowing that one Martian day is approximately the length of one Earth day,\" so yes, so T_m = 2 Earth days, T_e = 1 Earth day. So T_m / T_e = 2.\n\nNow, using Kepler's third law for both cases:\n\nFor Mars spacecraft: (T_m)² = (4π² / (G M_m)) * r_m³\n\nFor Earth satellite: (T_e)² = (4π² / (G M_e)) * r_e³\n\nIf I take the ratio of these two equations, the 4π² and G will cancel out. Let me write:\n\n(T_m² / T_e²) = (M_e / M_m) * (r_m³ / r_e³)\n\nTherefore, rearranging:\n\n(r_m / r_e)³ = (T_m² / T_e²) * (M_e / M_m)\n\nThen:\n\n(r_m / r_e) = [(T_m² / T_e²) * (M_e / M_m)]^(1/3)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nT_m / T_e = 2, so T_m² / T_e² = 4\n\nM_e / M_m = 1 / 0.1 = 10, since Mars is 0.1 times Earth's mass.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(r_m / r_e)³ = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nWait, so (r_m / r_e) = cube root of 40? But none of the options are cube root of 40. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait the question asks for the ratio of the spacecraft's orbital radius (around Mars) to that of a geosynchronous satellite on Earth. So r_m / r_e. But according to my calculation, that ratio cubed is (T_m² / T_e²)*(M_e / M_m). Let me check again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nFor Mars: T_m² = (4π² / (G M_m)) r_m³\n\nFor Earth: T_e² = (4π² / (G M_e)) r_e³\n\nDivide the first equation by the second:\n\n(T_m² / T_e²) = (M_e / M_m) * (r_m³ / r_e³)\n\nYes, because (4π²/G) cancels out in numerator and denominator. Therefore:\n\nr_m³ / r_e³ = (T_m² / T_e²) * (M_e / M_m)\n\nTherefore, r_m / r_e = [ (T_m / T_e)² * (M_e / M_m) ]^(1/3)\n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\nT_m is 2 days, T_e is 1 day. So (T_m / T_e)² = (2/1)^2 = 4\n\nM_e / M_m = 1 / 0.1 = 10. So multiplying 4 * 10 = 40. Therefore, r_m / r_e = cube root of 40.\n\nBut the options given are:\n\nA) cube root of 4\n\nB) cube root of 1/4\n\nC) cube root of 5/2\n\nD) cube root of 2/5\n\nHmm, cube root of 40 is not among them. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again. It says the spacecraft flies in a circular orbit around Mars with period of 2 Martian days. And the geosynchronous satellite has a period of 1 Earth day. But maybe there is a miscalculation here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the ratio inverted? Let me check.\n\nIf the question asks for the ratio of spacecraft's orbital radius (Mars) to geosynchronous satellite's (Earth), which is r_m / r_e. According to the calculation, it's cube root(40). But 40 is 8*5, so cube root(8*5) is 2*cube root(5). But none of the options have that.\n\nWait, but maybe I messed up the mass ratio. The problem says Mars' mass is about 0.1 times Earth's mass. So M_m = 0.1*M_e. Therefore, M_e / M_m is 1 / 0.1 = 10. That part is correct.\n\nThen T_m is 2 days, T_e is 1 day. So (T_m / T_e)^2 is 4. So 4*10=40. So cube root of 40. But none of the options is cube root(40). So maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the period? Wait, the problem says \"the 'Tianwen-1' probe flew in an elliptical parking orbit around Mars, with a period of 2 Martian days. Assuming a certain spacecraft flies in a circular orbit around Mars, with a period also of 2 Martian days...\" So the spacecraft's period is 2 Martian days, which is approximately 2 Earth days. And the geosynchronous satellite's period is 1 Earth day. So T_m = 2*T_e.\n\nBut if the answer is not among the options, then maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula in terms of the geosynchronous satellite. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express both radii using Kepler's law and take the ratio.\n\nFor any satellite, the orbital radius can be found by:\n\nr = [ G M T² / (4π²) ]^(1/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio r_m / r_e would be [ (G M_m T_m² / 4π² ) / (G M_e T_e² / 4π² ) ]^(1/3) = [ (M_m / M_e) * (T_m / T_e)^2 ]^(-1/3)? Wait no:\n\nWait, let me write:\n\nr_m³ = (G M_m / 4π²) T_m²\n\nr_e³ = (G M_e / 4π²) T_e²\n\nTherefore, r_m³ / r_e³ = (M_m / M_e) * (T_m² / T_e²)\n\nWait, earlier I had (T_m² / T_e²) = (M_e / M_m) * (r_m³ / r_e³). But now according to this, r_m³ / r_e³ = (M_m / M_e) * (T_m² / T_e²). Which contradicts my previous result. Wait, which is correct?\n\nLet me rederive.\n\nStarting with Kepler's third law:\n\nT² = (4π² / (G M)) r³\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\nr³ = (G M / 4π²) T²\n\nTherefore, for Mars: r_m³ = (G M_m / 4π²) T_m²\n\nFor Earth: r_e³ = (G M_e / 4π²) T_e²\n\nDivide r_m³ / r_e³ = [ (G M_m / 4π²) T_m² ] / [ (G M_e / 4π²) T_e² ] = (M_m / M_e) * (T_m / T_e)^2\n\nTherefore, r_m / r_e = [ (M_m / M_e) * (T_m / T_e)^2 ]^(1/3)\n\nWait, so previously I had the inverse ratio. Which was my mistake! Earlier, when I divided the equations, I think I messed up the ratio. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nFor Mars: T_m² = (4π² / (G M_m)) r_m³ → rearranged to r_m³ = (G M_m / 4π²) T_m²\n\nFor Earth: T_e² = (4π² / (G M_e)) r_e³ → rearranged to r_e³ = (G M_e / 4π²) T_e²\n\nTherefore, dividing r_m³ / r_e³ = [ (G M_m / 4π²) T_m² ] / [ (G M_e / 4π²) T_e² ] = (M_m / M_e) * (T_m / T_e)^2\n\nTherefore, r_m / r_e = [ (M_m / M_e) * (T_m / T_e)^2 ]^(1/3)\n\nAh! Previously I had (M_e / M_m) instead of (M_m / M_e). That was my mistake. So the correct ratio is [ (M_m / M_e) * (T_m / T_e)^2 ]^(1/3). Which is different from before. So let me recalculate.\n\nGiven:\n\nM_m / M_e = 0.1\n\nT_m / T_e = 2\n\nTherefore:\n\n(M_m / M_e) * (T_m / T_e)^2 = 0.1 * 4 = 0.4\n\nTherefore, r_m / r_e = cube root(0.4) = cube root(2/5) since 0.4 is 2/5. Therefore, option D is cube root(2/5). So the answer is D.\n\nWait, so my initial mistake was flipping the mass ratio. Initially, I had (M_e / M_m) which was 10, but the correct expression is (M_m / M_e) which is 0.1. That explains why I got 40 before, which was wrong. Now, with the corrected formula, it's 0.1 * 4 = 0.4 = 2/5, so cube root(2/5), which is option D.\n\nLet me just check again step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\nr_m³ / r_e³ = (M_m / M_e) * (T_m / T_e)^2\n\nM_m is 0.1*M_e, so M_m / M_e = 0.1.\n\nT_m is 2*T_e (since T_m is 2 Martian days, which is approx 2 Earth days, and T_e is 1 Earth day for geosynchronous).\n\nTherefore, (T_m / T_e)^2 = (2)^2 = 4.\n\nMultiply them: 0.1 * 4 = 0.4 = 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the ratio (r_m / r_e) is cube root(2/5), which is option D. So the answer is D.\n\nI think that makes sense now. Initially, I had the ratio inverted because of a miscalculation during division. So the key was to correctly set up the ratio of the radii using Kepler's third law and ensuring the mass ratio is properly accounted for.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that since Mars has less mass than Earth, for the same orbital period, the orbital radius should be smaller? Wait, but here the period for Mars orbit is longer (2 days vs 1 day). Wait, no, the period for the Mars satellite is 2 days, and for Earth geosynchronous it's 1 day. So even though Mars is less massive, the period is longer, so how does that affect the radius?\n\nThe formula shows that if you increase the period, the radius increases. But since Mars has less mass, the radius would decrease. So which effect is stronger? For the Mars case, period is doubled, which tends to increase radius, but mass is 0.1, which tends to decrease radius. Let's see:\n\nThe cube of radius is proportional to T² * M. So if T doubles, T² becomes 4 times. If M becomes 0.1, then overall 4*0.1=0.4. So radius is smaller than Earth's geosynchronous. Which makes sense because even though the period is longer, the lower mass of Mars means the orbital radius doesn't need to be as large. Therefore, the ratio is cube root(0.4) which is less than 1, so options B and D are less than 1. Option B is cube root(1/4)=cube root(0.25)≈0.63, and D is cube root(2/5)=cube root(0.4)≈0.737. So our calculation says D. So that must be correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
