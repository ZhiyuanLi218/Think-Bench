Let me recall what I know about the double-slit experiment. \n\nFirst, the basic setup: there are two slits, and when light passes through them, it creates an interference pattern on a screen. The pattern consists of bright and dark fringes. The spacing between these fringes depends on several factors.\n\nI remember there's a formula for the position of the bright fringes. Let me try to remember it. I think it's something like y = (λL)/d, where y is the distance from the central maximum to a bright fringe, λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the separation between the two slits. \n\nWait, actually, isn't that for the first-order maximum? Or is it a general formula for the fringe spacing? Maybe I need to be precise here. The formula for the fringe spacing (the distance between consecutive bright fringes) is Δy = (λL)/d. So the fringe width is directly proportional to the wavelength λ, the distance to the screen L, and inversely proportional to the slit separation d. \n\nSo if I want to increase the fringe width Δy, I need to increase λ, increase L, or decrease d. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Use light of a shorter wavelength. That would decrease Δy, so this would make the fringes narrower. So A is not the answer.\n\nB: Move the screen closer to the slits. That would decrease L, which would decrease Δy. So moving the screen closer would make the fringes narrower. So B is not the answer either.\n\nC: Move the slits closer together. That would decrease d, which according to the formula would increase Δy. So moving the slits closer together would increase the fringe width. So C is a possible correct answer.\n\nD: Use light with a lower wave speed. Hmm, wave speed in what medium? Wait, the speed of light in a medium is related to the wavelength and frequency. The speed of light v = λf, where f is the frequency. If the wave speed is lower, but the frequency remains the same (since frequency is determined by the source), then the wavelength λ would decrease. But if the wavelength decreases, then according to the formula Δy = (λL)/d, the fringe width would decrease. So if you use light with lower wave speed (assuming frequency is same, which I think is the case if the source is the same), then λ decreases, so Δy decreases. Therefore D would not be correct. \n\nBut wait, maybe I need to think about wave speed in the context of the medium. If the experiment is done in a medium where light travels slower, like water, then the wavelength would be shorter. But the question says \"use light with a lower wave speed\"—but light's speed in a vacuum is constant. Maybe they are referring to changing the medium? But the problem doesn't specify that. Also, in standard double-slit experiments, the medium is usually air or vacuum. So if you use a different medium where the speed is lower, but the question is about changing the light's wave speed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to refer to using a different type of light with a different speed. But in reality, the speed of light in a vacuum is a constant, so changing the wave speed would imply changing the medium. But if you change the medium, then the wavelength changes. However, if the question is about using light with a lower wave speed (say, in a different medium), but then you have to consider that the frequency remains the same, so λ = v/f. So if v decreases, λ decreases. So then Δy decreases. Therefore, D would not increase the fringe width. \n\nSo the correct answer should be C: Move the slits closer together. Let me check again.\n\nYes, according to Δy = (λL)/d. So if d decreases, Δy increases. So moving the slits closer together (decreasing d) increases the fringe width. So option C is correct. The other options either decrease Δy or don't affect it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
