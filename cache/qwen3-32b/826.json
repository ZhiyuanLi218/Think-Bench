In general:\n\n- A **low contact angle** (e.g., < 90°) indicates that the liquid spreads well on the surface, meaning the surface is **hydrophilic** (for water) or **oleophilic** (for oil).\n- A **high contact angle** (e.g., > 90°) indicates poor wettability, meaning the surface is **hydrophobic** (for water) or **oleophobic** (for oil).\n\n---\n\n### **Effect of CF₄ Plasma Treatment**\n\nCF₄ (carbon tetrafluoride) is a **fluorinated gas**, and when used in plasma treatment, it deposits **fluorinated functional groups** (like –CF₃ or –CF₂–) onto the surface of the material. These groups are **highly hydrophobic and oleophobic** due to the low surface energy of fluorinated materials.\n\nThis treatment typically:\n\n- **Increases the water contact angle**, making the surface more **hydrophobic**.\n- **Increases the oil contact angle**, making the surface more **oleophobic**.\n\nFluorinated surfaces are known to have **very low surface energy**, which results in **high contact angles** for both polar (like water) and non-polar (like oil) liquids.\n\n---\n\n### **Analyzing the Options**\n\nGiven the **original contact angles** of:\n\n- Water: 65° (moderately hydrophilic)\n- Oil: 40° (moderately oleophilic)\n\nWe expect **both contact angles to increase** after treatment with CF₄ plasma, due to increased hydrophobicity and oleophobicity.\n\nLet’s evaluate the options:\n\n- **A: Water = 122°, Oil = 104°**  \n  ✅ Both values are significantly higher than the original, and water contact angle is higher than oil, which is consistent with the expected behavior. Water (higher surface tension) should have a higher contact angle on a low-energy surface.\n\n- **B: Water = 37°, Oil = 18°**  \n  ❌ Both contact angles are lower than the original, which implies the surface became more hydrophilic and oleophilic — **inconsistent** with CF₄ plasma treatment.\n\n- **C: Water = 104°, Oil = 122°**  \n  ❌ While both values are higher, **oil contact angle is higher than water**, which is **unexpected**. Oil has a lower surface tension than water, so on a low-energy surface, water should have a **higher** contact angle.\n\n- **D: Water = 122°, Oil = 18°**  \n  ❌ Water contact angle is high (as expected), but oil contact angle is **much lower**, implying the surface became **more oleophilic**, which is **not consistent** with CF₄ plasma treatment.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly **Option A** matches the expected outcome of a CF₄ plasma treatment: **both water and oil contact angles increase**, with **water having a higher contact angle than oil**, due to the lower surface energy and higher fluorination-induced hydrophobicity.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A: Water = 122°, Oil = 104°}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about contact angles of water and oil on a glass surface before and after treatment with CF4 plasma. The original contact angles are 65° for water and 40° for oil. After treatment, we need to estimate the new contact angles from the given options.\n\nFirst, I remember that contact angles are a measure of wettability. A lower contact angle means the liquid spreads more, indicating a more hydrophilic (for water) or oleophilic (for oil) surface. Higher contact angles mean the liquid beads up, which is hydrophobic or oleophobic.\n\nNow, the glass is treated with CF4 plasma. CF4 is carbon tetrafluoride, right? I think plasma treatments can modify the surface properties. For example, using a plasma with fluorine-based gases like CF4 usually makes the surface more hydrophobic because fluorine is very electronegative and tends to create low-energy surfaces. Wait, but wait—CF4 plasma might also introduce fluorine atoms or functional groups onto the surface. Fluorinated surfaces are typically hydrophobic and oleophobic because fluorine has low surface energy. So if the original glass was relatively hydrophilic (water contact angle 65° is moderate, maybe a bit hydrophilic?), after CF4 treatment, it should become more hydrophobic, so the water contact angle should increase.\n\nSimilarly, for oil. The original oil contact angle is 40°, which is lower than water. But if the surface becomes more oleophobic after CF4 treatment, the oil contact angle should also increase. Wait, but maybe oil has a different behavior. Let me think. Oils are generally less polar than water. If the surface is made more hydrophobic (and oleophobic), then both water and oil contact angles would increase. But maybe the effect is more pronounced for water?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Water = 122°, Oil = 104° (both high, water higher)\nB: Water = 37°, Oil = 18° (both lower, which would be if the surface became more hydrophilic and oleophilic, which doesn't fit with CF4 treatment)\nC: Water = 104°, Oil = 122° (oil higher than water)\nD: Water = 122°, Oil = 18° (water high, oil low)\n\nSo B and D are options where oil contact angle is lower than before. But if the treatment makes the surface more oleophobic, oil contact angle should increase. So B and D might not be correct. Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe the treatment with CF4 plasma makes the surface more hydrophobic but more oleophilic? That doesn't seem right. Fluorinated surfaces are typically both hydrophobic and oleophobic because they have low surface energy. So if the surface energy is low, both water and oil (which have higher surface tension) would have higher contact angles. So both should increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be one where both contact angles are higher than the original 65° and 40°. Let's check the options:\n\nA: 122 and 104 – both higher, yes.\nC: 104 and 122 – both higher, yes.\nD: 122 and 18 – oil is lower, which would mean the surface became more oleophilic. That contradicts the idea that CF4 makes it oleophobic.\nB: lower for both, which is opposite.\n\nSo between A and C. Now, which one is more likely? The original water contact angle is 65°, oil is 40°. After treatment, both should increase. But how much?\n\nFluorination usually makes surfaces very hydrophobic. For example, Teflon has contact angles over 100° for water. If CF4 plasma treatment makes the surface similar to a fluoropolymer, then water contact angle might go up to around 100-120°. Oil contact angles might also increase, but maybe not as much? Or maybe oil contact angles can be even higher? Let me think about oil's surface tension. Oil has lower surface tension than water. For example, water's surface tension is about 72 mN/m, while oil is around 30-40 mN/m. A fluorinated surface has a low surface energy, maybe around 10-20 mN/m. So the difference between oil and the surface is less than the difference between water and the surface. So the contact angle for oil would be higher than the original, but maybe not as high as water's contact angle.\n\nWait, the contact angle depends on the difference between the liquid's surface tension and the surface's energy. If the surface is very low energy (fluorinated), then liquids with higher surface tension (like water) will have higher contact angles. For oil, which has lower surface tension, maybe the contact angle would be higher than before, but perhaps not as high as water's. For example, original oil contact angle is 40°, after treatment, maybe it becomes 80° or 100°, but not necessarily higher than water's contact angle.\n\nLooking at option A: water 122°, oil 104°. So oil contact angle is lower than water's. That seems plausible if the surface energy is low. Option C: water 104°, oil 122°, which would mean oil has higher contact angle than water. That would only happen if the surface energy is higher than the oil's surface tension but lower than water's. But if the surface is made lower in energy, then both should have higher contact angles, but water's would be higher because its surface tension is higher. So A is more plausible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n</think>"}
