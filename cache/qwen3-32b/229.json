Let me start by breaking down the IUPAC name to figure out the structure of the molecule.\n\nThe name is (2R)-3-anilinopropane-1,2-diol. Let's parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the core structure is \"propane-1,2-diol\". Propane is a three-carbon chain. The \"1,2-diol\" part means there are hydroxyl (-OH) groups on carbons 1 and 2. So, the molecule has a three-carbon chain with OH groups on the first and second carbons.\n\nNext, there's a substituent at position 3: \"3-anilino\". Aniline is the common name for aminobenzene, which is a benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2). So, \"anilino\" would be the aniline group attached via the nitrogen? Wait, no. The term \"anilino\" typically refers to the phenylamino group. Let me think. The structure of aniline is C6H5NH2. So, an anilino group would be C6H5NH- attached to the main chain. So, in this case, the aniline is attached to carbon 3 of the propane-1,2-diol. So the main chain is three carbons with OHs on 1 and 2, and an aniline group on carbon 3.\n\nThe (2R) part indicates the stereochemistry at carbon 2. However, since we are calculating molar mass, the stereochemistry (R or S) doesn't affect the molecular weight, so we can ignore that for the purpose of calculating molar mass.\n\nNow, to compute the molar weight, I need to determine the molecular formula of this compound. Let's build it step by step.\n\nThe main chain is propane-1,2-diol. Let's write that out. Propane is CH3-CH2-CH2-. But with hydroxyl groups on carbons 1 and 2. So, carbon 1 is CH2OH, carbon 2 is CH(OH), and carbon 3 is CH2-? Wait, let's clarify the numbering. The propane chain is three carbons. Let me number them as follows:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)\nCarbon 3: CH2?\n\nBut wait, the substituent is at position 3. So the aniline group is attached to carbon 3. Let me sketch this mentally.\n\nThe structure would be:\n\nHO-CH(OH)-CH2- (but wait, no). Wait, propane-1,2-diol is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-? Wait, no. Let me get the correct structure.\n\nIn propane-1,2-diol, the hydroxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 2 of a three-carbon chain. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)\nCarbon 3: CH2?\n\nBut propane is three carbons. So the full structure would be HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-R? No, wait, if the substituent is on carbon 3, then the main chain is three carbons with hydroxyls on 1 and 2, and the substituent on 3.\n\nSo the main chain is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)\nCarbon 3: CH2- (with an aniline group attached here)\n\nBut wait, in a three-carbon chain, carbon 3 would be the end carbon. So the structure would be:\n\nHO-CH(OH)-CH2- (but then where is the substituent? It's on carbon 3, which is the CH2 group. So the substituent is attached to the third carbon. So the structure is:\n\nHO-CH(OH)-CH2- (aniline group here)\n\nSo the full structure is HO-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5? Wait, no. The substituent is \"anilino\", which is the aniline group attached via the nitrogen. Wait, the term \"anilino\" is when the aniline is acting as a substituent. Let me think. Aniline is C6H5NH2. If it's an anilino group, then it would be C6H5NH- as a substituent. So in the molecule, the aniline is attached to carbon 3 of the propane-1,2-diol. So the structure would be:\n\nHO-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5?\n\nBut wait, the carbon chain is propane, so the third carbon is CH2, and the aniline is attached to that CH2. So the structure is:\n\nHO-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5?\n\nBut that would make the third carbon (CH2) connected to an NH-C6H5 group. Let me check. The substituent is \"3-anilino\", meaning the aniline is attached to carbon 3. So carbon 3 is CH2-NH-C6H5?\n\nYes. So the full molecule is:\n\nHO-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The propane-1,2-diol is three carbons with OH on 1 and 2. Carbon 3 is CH2- with an anilino group attached. So the formula would be:\n\nCarbon 1: HO-CH2-\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\nCarbon 3: CH2-NH-C6H5\n\nSo the full structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nBut wait, that would be propane-1,2-diol with an aniline group on carbon 3. Let me check the carbon count. Propane is three carbons. The first carbon is CH2OH, second is CH(OH), third is CH2 with substituent. So yes.\n\nNow, to find the molecular formula, let's count all the atoms.\n\nFirst, the main chain:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH → C, 2 H, O, H? Wait, let me break it down properly.\n\nActually, each carbon's bonds need to be considered. Let's approach it systematically.\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5\n\nLet's write out each part:\n\n1. HO-CH2-: This is a hydroxymethyl group. The carbon here is connected to two hydrogens, one oxygen (from -OH), and the next carbon. So the first carbon is CH2OH.\n\n2. CH(OH)-: The second carbon is CH(OH), connected to the first carbon (CH2OH) and the third carbon (CH2-).\n\n3. CH2-NH-C6H5: The third carbon is CH2 connected to NH-C6H5.\n\nLet me write the entire structure:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5\n\nNow, let's count all the atoms.\n\nFirst, the carbon chain:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH → 1 C, 2 H, 1 O, 1 H (from OH). Wait, maybe better to count all atoms.\n\nLet me write the entire molecule's formula.\n\nThe main chain is three carbons:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH → C, 2 H, O, H (from OH). Wait, perhaps breaking down each part:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5\n\nLet me count each element:\n\nCarbon (C):\n\n- The three-carbon chain: 3 C\n- The benzene ring in aniline: C6H5 is a benzene ring with 5 hydrogens. Wait, the aniline group is NH-C6H5. So the benzene ring is C6H5, which has 6 C atoms.\n\nTotal C: 3 (from propane) + 6 (from benzene) = 9 C atoms?\n\nWait, but the NH group is attached to the third carbon. Let me confirm:\n\nThe structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5. So the NH is attached to the third carbon (CH2) of the propane chain, and the benzene ring is attached to the NH. So the aniline group is NH-C6H5. So the benzene ring has 6 C atoms.\n\nSo total C: 3 (propane) + 6 (benzene) = 9 C.\n\nHydrogen (H):\n\nLet's count all H atoms.\n\nFirst, the propane-1,2-diol part:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-\n\nLet's break down each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: HO-CH2- → The first carbon is CH2OH. So:\n\n- CH2 group has 2 H attached to the carbon.\n- The OH group has 1 H.\nSo total H from carbon 1: 2 (from CH2) + 1 (from OH) = 3 H.\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)- → The second carbon is CH(OH). Let's see:\n\n- The carbon is connected to one H (since it's CH), one OH, and two other bonds (to C1 and C3). Wait, the structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH...\n\nWait, the second carbon is CH(OH). Let me think about its bonding. The carbon is connected to:\n\n- One H (from CH)\n- One OH\n- The previous carbon (C1)\n- The next carbon (C3)\n\nSo that's four bonds. So the second carbon has one H attached. Then, the OH contributes one H. So for carbon 2: 1 H (from CH) + 1 H (from OH) = 2 H.\n\nCarbon 3: CH2-NH- → This carbon is CH2 connected to NH. So the carbon has two H's attached. Then, the NH group: nitrogen has one H attached (since it's NH, not NH2). Wait, the aniline group is NH-C6H5. So the NH is connected to the carbon 3 (CH2) and the benzene ring. So the nitrogen has two bonds: one to the carbon 3 (CH2) and one to the benzene ring. Wait, but nitrogen usually has three bonds. So if it's NH, then it has one H attached. So the NH group is N-H connected to the carbon and the benzene ring.\n\nSo the NH group has 1 H.\n\nNow, let's count the H in the entire molecule.\n\nStarting with the propane-1,2-diol part:\n\nCarbon 1: 3 H (as above)\nCarbon 2: 2 H (as above)\nCarbon 3: 2 H (from CH2)\nThen, the NH group has 1 H.\n\nNow, the benzene ring: C6H5 is a benzene ring with five hydrogens. Wait, normally a benzene ring has six hydrogens, but when it's substituted (like in aniline), one hydrogen is replaced by a substituent. In aniline, the NH2 is attached to the benzene ring. But in our case, the aniline group is attached to the carbon chain via NH. So the benzene ring in this case is C6H5, which is a benzene ring missing one hydrogen (since one position is attached to the NH group). So normally, benzene has 6 H, but with one H replaced by a substituent (here, the NH group), so the benzene ring has 5 H.\n\nSo the benzene ring contributes 5 H.\n\nNow, let's add up all the H:\n\nFrom Carbon 1: 3 H\nFrom Carbon 2: 2 H\nFrom Carbon 3: 2 H\nFrom NH group: 1 H\nFrom benzene ring: 5 H\nPlus any other H?\n\nWait, maybe I missed some H. Let me check each part again.\n\nCarbon 1 is HO-CH2-: The CH2 has two H, and the OH has one H. So total 3 H.\n\nCarbon 2 is CH(OH)-: The CH has one H, and the OH has one H. Total 2 H.\n\nCarbon 3 is CH2-NH-: The CH2 has two H.\n\nThen, the NH group has one H.\n\nThe benzene ring has five H.\n\nBut wait, are there any other H on the carbon chain? Let me think.\n\nThe carbon chain is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nSo, the first carbon is CH2OH (as mentioned), second is CH(OH), third is CH2-NH-.\n\nSo the carbon chain is:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nSo each carbon in the chain:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH (3 H as before)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH) (2 H as before)\nCarbon 3: CH2-NH (2 H as before)\n\nSo total H from the carbon chain and NH group: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 H?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing some H on the carbon chain. Let me think again.\n\nLet me write out the entire structure with all H atoms:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- HO-CH2-: The first carbon is CH2OH. The CH2 has two H attached to the carbon, and the OH has one H. So total 3 H here.\n\n- The second carbon is CH(OH). The carbon is connected to one H (CH), one OH (with H), and the rest are bonds to adjacent carbons. So that's 2 H here.\n\n- The third carbon is CH2-NH. The CH2 has two H attached to the carbon. The NH has one H attached to the nitrogen.\n\n- The benzene ring is C6H5, which has five H.\n\nBut wait, what about the H on the benzene ring? The benzene ring has five H because one position is connected to the NH group.\n\nSo total H from all parts:\n\nCarbon 1: 3 H\nCarbon 2: 2 H\nCarbon 3: 2 H\nNH group: 1 H\nBenzene ring: 5 H\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 13 H?\n\nWait, but I think I'm missing some H on the carbon chain. Let me think again.\n\nLet me write the entire molecule's structure with all atoms:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5\n\nLet me count each H:\n\n1. The first carbon (CH2OH): The CH2 has two H, and the OH has one H. Total 3 H.\n\n2. The second carbon (CH(OH)): The carbon has one H (from CH), and the OH has one H. Total 2 H.\n\n3. The third carbon (CH2): The CH2 has two H.\n\n4. The NH group: The nitrogen has one H.\n\n5. The benzene ring (C6H5): Five H.\n\nBut wait, are there any other H on the carbon chain? Let me check the bonds again.\n\nThe structure is:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nSo, the first carbon (CH2OH) is connected to the second carbon (CH(OH)).\n\nThe second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to the third carbon (CH2).\n\nThe third carbon (CH2) is connected to the NH group.\n\nSo the carbon chain is three carbons with the specified substituents. So the H counts as above.\n\nNow, let's check the oxygen atoms. The molecule has two OH groups (on carbons 1 and 2) and the NH group.\n\nSo oxygen atoms: two O (from the two OH groups).\n\nNitrogen atoms: one N (from the NH group).\n\nCarbon atoms: 3 (propane) + 6 (benzene) = 9 C.\n\nHydrogen atoms: 3 (from first carbon) + 2 (second) + 2 (third) + 1 (NH) + 5 (benzene) = 13 H.\n\nWait, but wait, the benzene ring has five H, but each carbon in the ring has one H? Wait, no. A benzene ring has six carbon atoms, each with one H normally. If one of the H is replaced by a substituent (here, the NH group), then the ring has five H. So yes, five H.\n\nSo total H is 13?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing some H on the carbon chain. Let me count again.\n\nLet me write the entire formula step by step.\n\nFirst, the carbon chain:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-\n\nLet me write the formula for this part:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH → C, 2 H, O, 1 H (from OH)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH) → C, 1 H, O, 1 H\nCarbon 3: CH2 → C, 2 H\nNH → N, 1 H\n\nSo for the carbon chain and NH part:\n\nC: 3\nH: 2 (from CH2 of C1) + 1 (from OH of C1) + 1 (from CH of C2) + 1 (from OH of C2) + 2 (from CH2 of C3) + 1 (from NH) = 2+1+1+1+2+1 = 8 H?\nWait, but earlier I had 3+2+2+1=8 H? But when I broke it down into each part, I had 3 (from C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 1 (NH) = 8 H. But the benzene ring adds 5 H, so total H is 8 + 5 = 13.\n\nOxygen atoms: 2 O (from two OH groups)\nNitrogen atoms: 1 N (from NH)\nCarbon atoms: 3 (propane) + 6 (benzene) = 9 C\n\nSo the molecular formula would be C9H13O2N.\n\nLet me check if that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me cross-validate. Let's think of the molecule as:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nHO-CH2- is C1H3O (since HO-CH2- has one C, three H, and one O).\n\nCH(OH)- is C1H2O (since it's CH(OH), one C, two H, one O).\n\nCH2-NH- is C1H2N (since it's CH2-NH, one C, two H, one N).\n\nThen, the benzene ring is C6H5.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\nC: 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 9\nH: 3 (from first part) + 2 (second) + 2 (third) + 5 (benzene) + 1 (from NH?) Wait, maybe this breakdown is missing something.\n\nWait, the NH group has one H attached to the N. So in the third part (CH2-NH-), the NH has one H. So that H should be included. But in the previous breakdown, I considered the H in the CH2 and the NH separately.\n\nAlternatively, let's write the formula as:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nThis can be written as:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nWhich is:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nC: 3 (propane) + 6 (benzene) = 9\nH: Let's count each H:\n\n- HO-CH2-: 3 H (as before)\n- CH(OH)-: 2 H\n- CH2-NH-: 2 H (from CH2) + 1 H (from NH) = 3 H\n- C6H5: 5 H\n\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 13 H.\n\nO: 2 (from two OH groups)\nN: 1 (from NH)\n\nSo molecular formula is C9H13O2N.\n\nNow, to calculate the molar mass, I need to find the sum of the atomic weights of each atom in the molecule.\n\nAtomic weights (using standard atomic weights):\n\nCarbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\nHydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\nNitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\n\nCalculating:\n\nCarbon: 9 * 12.01 = 108.09 g/mol\nHydrogen: 13 * 1.008 = 13.104 g/mol\nOxygen: 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol\nNitrogen: 1 * 14.01 = 14.01 g/mol\n\nAdding them up:\n\n108.09 + 13.104 + 32.00 + 14.01 = ?\n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n108.09 + 13.104 = 121.194\n121.194 + 32.00 = 153.194\n153.194 + 14.01 = 167.204 g/mol\n\nSo the molar mass is approximately 167.20 g/mol.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nA: 159.230\nB: 131.130\nC: 167.200\nD: 179.260\n\nThe calculated molar mass is approximately 167.20 g/mol, which matches option C.\n\nBut let me double-check my molecular formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the formula again.\n\nThe molecule is (2R)-3-anilinopropane-1,2-diol. The structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nCarbon count: 3 (propane) + 6 (benzene) = 9 C. Correct.\n\nHydrogen count: Let's recount.\n\nHO-CH2-: HO-CH2- has 3 H (as discussed).\n\nCH(OH)-: The carbon has one H (CH) and the OH has one H. So total 2 H.\n\nCH2-NH-: The CH2 has two H, and the NH has one H. Total 3 H.\n\nBenzene ring: 5 H.\n\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 13 H. Correct.\n\nOxygen: 2 O. Correct.\n\nNitrogen: 1 N. Correct.\n\nSo molecular formula C9H13O2N. Molar mass calculation:\n\nC: 9 * 12.01 = 108.09\nH: 13 * 1.008 = 13.104\nO: 2 * 16.00 = 32.00\nN: 1 * 14.01 = 14.01\n\nTotal: 108.09 + 13.104 + 32.00 + 14.01 = 167.204 g/mol.\n\nSo the answer should be option C: 167.200 g/mol.\n\nBut let me check if there's a possibility of an error in the molecular formula. For example, maybe the aniline group is attached differently? Let me consider if the aniline is attached via the amino group to the carbon chain, which would be a primary amine.\n\nWait, aniline is C6H5NH2. If we have an anilino group attached to the carbon chain, it would be C6H5NH- as a substituent. So the structure is indeed as I've drawn: the carbon chain with NH-C6H5.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the molecule is 3-(anilino)propane-1,2-diol. So the propane-1,2-diol has an aniline group on carbon 3.\n\nYes, so the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hydrogen count. Let me try another approach. Let's calculate the molecular formula using the IUPAC name and standard nomenclature rules.\n\nThe molecule is propane-1,2-diol, which is HOCH2CH(OH)CH2-.\n\nThen, the aniline group is attached to carbon 3, making it 3-anilinopropane-1,2-diol.\n\nSo the formula for propane-1,2-diol is C3H8O2. But with the aniline group attached.\n\nWait, propane-1,2-diol is HOCH2CH(OH)CH2-? No, propane is three carbons. Let's write its formula.\n\nPropane is C3H8. Propane-1,2-diol would be C3H6(OH)2. So the formula is C3H6O2. But when we attach the aniline group to carbon 3, we need to consider the substitution.\n\nThe aniline group is C6H5NH2. But when it's attached to the carbon chain, one hydrogen from the NH2 is replaced by a bond to the carbon chain, making it C6H5NH-.\n\nSo the molecular formula of the compound would be:\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2. But with a substitution on carbon 3: replacing a hydrogen with the aniline group.\n\nThe carbon 3 in propane-1,2-diol would be CH2OH? No, propane-1,2-diol is HOCH2CH(OH)CH2-? No, let me get the correct formula.\n\nActually, propane-1,2-diol is HOCH2CH(OH)CH2-? No, propane is three carbons. The correct structure is:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-R?\n\nWait, no. Let's think about the formula of propane-1,2-diol.\n\nThe formula of propane is C3H8. Adding two hydroxyl groups (-OH) would add two O and two H (since each -OH adds one O and one H). But we also need to account for the fact that adding each -OH group removes one H from the carbon it's attached to.\n\nSo for propane-1,2-diol:\n\nOriginal propane: C3H8.\n\nAdd two -OH groups on carbons 1 and 2. Each -OH adds one O and one H, but replaces one H from the carbon. So for each -OH added, the formula changes by O (since H is added but one H is removed).\n\nSo for each -OH added, the formula is +O.\n\nSo propane (C3H8) becomes C3H8-2H + 2O = C3H6O2.\n\nSo the formula of propane-1,2-diol is C3H6O2.\n\nNow, when we attach the aniline group to carbon 3, we are replacing one hydrogen on carbon 3 with the aniline group.\n\nCarbon 3 in propane-1,2-diol is CH2- (since the first two carbons have OH groups). So the third carbon is CH2-.\n\nAttaching the aniline group (C6H5NH-) to this carbon would replace one H from CH2 with the aniline group. So the formula becomes:\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nAfter attaching aniline group: C3H6O2 - H + (C6H5NH).\n\nBut the aniline group is C6H5NH, which is C6H5NH. Wait, the molecular formula of aniline is C6H5NH2 (C6H7N). When we attach it to the carbon chain, one H is replaced by the carbon chain, so the aniline group becomes C6H5NH-.\n\nSo the formula of the aniline group is C6H5NH, which is C6H5N H (but one H is replaced by the carbon chain). Wait, maybe better to think of the aniline group as C6H5NH2 minus one H, so C6H5NH.\n\nSo the molecular formula of the compound is:\n\nC3H6O2 - H + C6H5NH = C3H5O2 + C6H5NH.\n\nCombining these:\n\nC: 3 + 6 = 9\nH: 5 + 5 + 1 (from NH?) Wait, need to be careful.\n\nLet me write it properly.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nWhen we attach the aniline group to carbon 3, we remove one H from carbon 3 and add the aniline group.\n\nSo the formula becomes:\n\nC3H6O2 - H + (C6H5NH).\n\nBut what is the formula of the aniline group? Aniline is C6H5NH2. When we attach it to the carbon chain, we form a bond between the carbon chain and the nitrogen of the aniline group. So the aniline group is C6H5NH- (with a free bond to the carbon chain).\n\nSo the formula of the aniline group is C6H5NH, which is C6H5N H. But how many H does it contribute?\n\nLet me think of the aniline group as C6H5NH. The molecular formula of aniline is C6H5NH2 (C6H7N). When we attach it to the carbon chain, we lose one H from the NH2, making it C6H5NH-.\n\nSo the aniline group contributes C6H5N H (with one H).\n\nSo the formula of the compound is:\n\nC3H6O2 - H + C6H5NH = C3H5O2 + C6H5NH.\n\nNow, combining the H:\n\nOriginal H in propane-1,2-diol: 6 H.\n\nAfter removing one H: 5 H.\n\nAniline group contributes 5 H (from C6H5) + 1 H (from NH) = 6 H.\n\nSo total H: 5 + 6 = 11 H?\n\nWait, but earlier we had 13 H. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be more precise.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nWhen we attach the aniline group to carbon 3, we are replacing one H from carbon 3 with the aniline group.\n\nThe aniline group is C6H5NH. Let's determine its formula.\n\nAniline is C6H5NH2. When it's attached to the carbon chain, the formula becomes C6H5NH (since one H is replaced by the carbon chain). So the formula of the aniline group is C6H5NH.\n\nSo the molecular formula of the compound is:\n\nC3H6O2 - H + C6H5NH = C3H5O2 + C6H5NH.\n\nNow, combining the C, H, O, and N:\n\nCarbon: 3 + 6 = 9\nHydrogen: 5 (from C3H5) + 5 (from C6H5) + 1 (from NH) = 11 H\nOxygen: 2\nNitrogen: 1\n\nSo molecular formula: C9H11O2N.\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier calculation of C9H13O2N. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! I think I see the issue. When I considered the aniline group as C6H5NH, I need to account for the hydrogen atoms properly.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nThe aniline group is C6H5NH. The C6H5 part is a benzene ring with five H (since one H is replaced by the NH group). So the C6H5 part has five H. Then, the NH part has one H. So total H from the aniline group is 5 + 1 = 6 H.\n\nBut in the previous approach, when I subtracted one H from the propane-1,2-diol and added the aniline group, I calculated H as 5 + 6 = 11 H. But in the earlier breakdown, I had 13 H. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me go back to the first method where I counted each part and got 13 H. Where is the error?\n\nIn the first method, I considered the carbon chain as HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5 and counted H as 13. In this second method, using the formula approach, I get H as 11. There's a difference of 2 H.\n\nLet me find where the mistake is.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nWhen we attach the aniline group to carbon 3, we replace one H from carbon 3 with the aniline group.\n\nCarbon 3 in propane-1,2-diol is CH2- (since the first two carbons have OH groups). So the third carbon has two H's. Replacing one H with the aniline group leaves one H on carbon 3: CH2 becomes CH.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the third carbon is CH2, and we replace one H with the aniline group, it becomes CH-NH-C6H5. So the third carbon is CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nBut in the structure I previously considered, the third carbon is CH2-NH-C6H5. That would mean that the third carbon still has two H's attached, which is incorrect because we replaced one H with the aniline group.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. In my initial structure, I had CH2-NH-C6H5 for the third carbon, but actually, replacing one H from CH2 would leave one H, making it CH-NH-C6H5. So the third carbon has one H, not two.\n\nThis explains the discrepancy in hydrogen count.\n\nLet me correct this.\n\nThe correct structure is:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nSo the third carbon is CH (with one H) connected to NH-C6H5.\n\nNow, let's recount the H atoms.\n\nCarbon 1: HO-CH2-: 3 H (as before)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-: 2 H (as before)\nCarbon 3: CH-NH-: 1 H (from CH)\nNH group: 1 H\nBenzene ring: 5 H\n\nSo total H:\n\nCarbon 1: 3\nCarbon 2: 2\nCarbon 3: 1\nNH group: 1\nBenzene ring: 5\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 12 H.\n\nNow, let's also check the formula approach.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nAfter attaching aniline group, replacing one H from carbon 3:\n\nNew formula: C3H6O2 - H + C6H5NH = C3H5O2 + C6H5NH.\n\nNow, the aniline group is C6H5NH, which has 6 C, 5 H (from C6H5) + 1 H (from NH) = 6 H.\n\nSo total H: 5 (from C3H5) + 6 (from aniline) = 11 H.\n\nWait, but now we have a discrepancy between the two methods: 12 H vs 11 H.\n\nLet me check the structure again.\n\nCorrect structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nLet's count each H:\n\nCarbon 1: HO-CH2-: The CH2 has two H attached to the carbon, and the OH has one H. Total 3 H.\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-: The carbon has one H (from CH), and the OH has one H. Total 2 H.\nCarbon 3: CH-NH-: The carbon has one H attached.\nNH group: The nitrogen has one H attached.\nBenzene ring: 5 H.\n\nSo total H: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 12 H.\n\nBut according to the formula approach, it should be 11 H. Where is the error?\n\nLet me re-express the formula approach.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nAfter attaching aniline group, replacing one H from carbon 3:\n\nNew formula: C3H6O2 - H + C6H5NH.\n\nBut what is the formula of the aniline group?\n\nAniline is C6H5NH2. When we attach it to the carbon chain, we form a bond between the carbon chain and the nitrogen of the aniline group. This means one H from the NH2 is replaced by the carbon chain, making it C6H5NH-.\n\nSo the aniline group has the formula C6H5NH.\n\nLet's calculate the number of H in the aniline group:\n\nThe benzene ring (C6H5) has 5 H.\nThe NH group has one H.\nTotal H in aniline group: 5 + 1 = 6 H.\n\nNow, the original propane-1,2-diol had C3H6O2. After removing one H, we have C3H5O2.\n\nAdding the aniline group (C6H5NH) gives:\n\nC: 3 + 6 = 9\nH: 5 (from C3H5) + 6 (from aniline) = 11\nO: 2\nN: 1\n\nSo molecular formula C9H11O2N.\n\nBut in the structure, we counted 12 H. Where is the extra H?\n\nLet me check the structure again.\n\nStructure: HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nCarbon 1: HO-CH2-: 2 H (from CH2) + 1 H (from OH) = 3 H.\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-: 1 H (from CH) + 1 H (from OH) = 2 H.\nCarbon 3: CH-NH-: 1 H (from CH).\nNH group: 1 H.\nBenzene ring: 5 H.\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 12 H.\n\nBut according to the formula approach, it should be 11 H. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me write out the full molecular formula based on the structure:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nLet's write it out with all atoms:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- HO-CH2-: 1 C, 3 H, 1 O\n- CH(OH)-: 1 C, 2 H, 1 O\n- CH-NH-: 1 C, 1 H, 1 N\n- C6H5: 6 C, 5 H\n\nNow, adding up all atoms:\n\nCarbon: 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 9\nHydrogen: 3 (from first part) + 2 (second part) + 1 (third part) + 5 (benzene) + 1 (from NH) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 12 H.\nOxygen: 1 + 1 = 2\nNitrogen: 1\n\nSo molecular formula is C9H12O2N.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 12 H. But the formula approach gave 11 H. What's going on?\n\nLet me re-express the formula approach.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nAfter attaching aniline group, replacing one H from carbon 3:\n\nNew formula: C3H6O2 - H + C6H5NH = C3H5O2 + C6H5NH.\n\nBut what is the formula of the aniline group? Let's think of it as C6H5NH. But where did the H come from?\n\nAniline is C6H5NH2. When we attach it to the carbon chain, we form a bond between the carbon chain and the nitrogen of the aniline group. This means one H from the NH2 is replaced by the carbon chain, making it C6H5NH-.\n\nSo the aniline group has the formula C6H5NH, which is C6H5N H.\n\nBut the total number of H in the aniline group is 5 (from C6H5) + 1 (from NH) = 6 H.\n\nSo the aniline group contributes 6 H.\n\nThe original propane-1,2-diol after removing one H has 5 H.\n\nSo total H: 5 + 6 = 11 H.\n\nBut according to the structure, it's 12 H. Where is the extra H?\n\nLet me think about the attachment point. When we attach the aniline group to the carbon chain, we are forming a bond between the carbon and the nitrogen. This means that the carbon loses one H, and the nitrogen loses one H.\n\nWait, but in the structure, the carbon loses one H to form the bond to the nitrogen, and the nitrogen loses one H to form the bond to the carbon. So the total H removed is two: one from the carbon and one from the nitrogen.\n\nWait, no. When forming a bond between the carbon and the nitrogen, we're replacing one H from the carbon with the nitrogen, and one H from the nitrogen with the carbon. But in reality, it's a single bond: the carbon has a single bond to the nitrogen, and the nitrogen has one fewer H.\n\nLet me clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose we have a carbon with an H: -CH2- and we replace one H with -NH-C6H5.\n\nThe carbon goes from -CH2- to -CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nThe nitrogen in the aniline group goes from -NH2 to -NH-.\n\nSo the carbon loses one H, and the nitrogen loses one H.\n\nTherefore, total H removed is two: one from the carbon and one from the nitrogen.\n\nBut in my previous formula approach, I only accounted for removing one H from the carbon chain. I didn't account for the removal of one H from the nitrogen.\n\nThis is the mistake! In the formula approach, I should subtract one H from the carbon chain and one H from the aniline group.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nWhen attaching the aniline group, we remove one H from the carbon chain and one H from the aniline group.\n\nThe aniline group is originally C6H5NH2 (C6H7N).\n\nAfter removing one H from the aniline group, it becomes C6H5NH-.\n\nSo the aniline group contributes C6H5NH, which has 5 H (from C6H5) + 1 H (from NH) = 6 H.\n\nBut originally, it had 7 H (C6H7N).\n\nSo we removed one H from the aniline group.\n\nSo the total H removed is one from the carbon chain and one from the aniline group.\n\nSo the new formula is:\n\nC3H6O2 - H (from carbon) + (C6H7N - H) (from aniline) = C3H5O2 + C6H6N.\n\nNow, the molecular formula is C3H5O2 + C6H6N.\n\nCombining:\n\nCarbon: 3 + 6 = 9\nHydrogen: 5 + 6 = 11\nOxygen: 2\nNitrogen: 1\n\nSo molecular formula C9H11O2N.\n\nBut according to the structure, it's C9H12O2N. There's still a discrepancy of one H.\n\nLet me go back to the structure and recount carefully.\n\nStructure: HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nHO-CH2-: HO-CH2- has 3 H (2 from CH2, 1 from OH).\nCH(OH)-: CH(OH)- has 2 H (1 from CH, 1 from OH).\nCH-NH-: CH-NH- has 1 H (from CH) and 1 H (from NH).\nC6H5: 5 H.\n\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 12 H.\n\nBut according to the corrected formula approach, it should be 11 H. Where is the missing H?\n\nLet me think about the attachment of the aniline group.\n\nWhen the aniline group is attached to the carbon chain, the nitrogen is bonded to the carbon and has one H. So the NH group has one H. But in the structure, it's CH-NH-C6H5. The NH group has one H, and the CH has one H.\n\nSo the H from the NH group is one, and the H from the CH is one.\n\nBut in the formula approach, we have 11 H. Let me see:\n\nC9H11O2N.\n\nLet me count the H in this formula: 11 H.\n\nWhere is the missing H in the structure?\n\nLet me think about the carbon chain.\n\nThe carbon chain is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nLet me write the entire molecule with all atoms:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nLet me count each H:\n\n1. HO-CH2-: The first carbon is CH2OH. This has 2 H attached to the carbon and 1 H in the OH group. Total 3 H.\n2. CH(OH)-: The second carbon is CH(OH). This has 1 H attached to the carbon and 1 H in the OH group. Total 2 H.\n3. CH-NH-: The third carbon is CH-NH. This has 1 H attached to the carbon.\n4. NH group: The nitrogen has 1 H attached.\n5. C6H5: The benzene ring has 5 H.\n\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 12 H.\n\nBut according to the formula approach, it should be 11 H. Where is the extra H?\n\nLet me think about the attachment of the aniline group. When we attach the aniline group to the carbon chain, the carbon chain loses one H, and the aniline group loses one H. So total H removed is 2.\n\nBut in the formula approach, I subtracted one H from the carbon chain and one H from the aniline group, leading to 11 H. But in the structure, it's 12 H.\n\nWait, let me calculate the total H in the molecule using the formula approach.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nAfter attaching aniline group, removing one H from the carbon chain and one H from the aniline group:\n\nNew formula: C3H6O2 - H (from carbon) + (C6H7N - H) (from aniline) = C3H5O2 + C6H6N.\n\nSo the total H is 5 (from C3H5) + 6 (from C6H6N) = 11 H.\n\nBut in the structure, it's 12 H. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me think about the formula of the aniline group. If the aniline group is C6H5NH, then it has 5 H from the benzene ring and 1 H from the NH group, totaling 6 H. But the original aniline is C6H5NH2, which has 7 H. So we removed one H, giving 6 H.\n\nBut in the structure, the aniline group is attached to the carbon chain, and the NH group has one H. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the carbon chain also has the H from the CH group. Let me think about the carbon chain's H.\n\nThe carbon chain is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nThe third carbon is CH-NH-: this carbon has one H attached. So that's one H.\n\nThe NH group has one H attached.\n\nSo total H from these two parts is 1 + 1 = 2 H.\n\nIn the formula approach, these are part of the 11 H.\n\nBut in the structure, it's 12 H. Where is the extra H?\n\nLet me think about the entire molecule again.\n\nMaybe I missed an H in the carbon chain. Let me write out the full molecular formula based on the structure:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nLet's write it out with all atoms:\n\n- HO-CH2-: 1 C, 3 H, 1 O\n- CH(OH)-: 1 C, 2 H, 1 O\n- CH-NH-: 1 C, 1 H, 1 N\n- C6H5: 6 C, 5 H\n\nNow, adding up all H:\n\n3 (from first part) + 2 (second part) + 1 (third part) + 5 (benzene) + 1 (from NH) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 12 H.\n\nBut according to the formula approach, it should be 11 H. Where is the discrepancy?\n\nLet me think about the formula approach again.\n\nOriginal propane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nAfter attaching aniline group, removing one H from the carbon chain and one H from the aniline group:\n\nNew formula: C3H5O2 + C6H6N.\n\nLet's calculate the H in this formula:\n\nC3H5O2: 5 H\nC6H6N: 6 H\nTotal: 11 H.\n\nBut in the structure, it's 12 H. Where is the extra H?\n\nLet me think about the aniline group. The aniline group is C6H5NH. This is C6H5-NH. The C6H5 part has 5 H, and the NH part has 1 H, totaling 6 H. But in the structure, the NH is part of the molecule, and the C6H5 is also part of the molecule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the carbon chain also has an H in the CH-NH part. Let me think about the entire molecule.\n\nThe carbon chain is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nThe third carbon is CH-NH. This carbon has one H attached. That's one H.\n\nThe NH group has one H attached. That's another H.\n\nSo that's two H from these parts.\n\nIn the formula approach, these are included in the 11 H.\n\nBut in the structure, it's 12 H. Where is the extra H?\n\nWait, perhaps the original propane-1,2-diol has more H than I accounted for. Let me recalculate the original formula.\n\nPropane-1,2-diol: C3H6O2.\n\nLet me verify this. Propane is C3H8. Adding two -OH groups replaces two H with -OH groups. Each -OH adds one O and one H, but replaces one H from the carbon. So for each -OH added, the formula is +O.\n\nSo two -OH groups add two O, and the H changes from 8 to 8 - 2 + 2 = 8. Wait, no.\n\nWait, for each -OH added, we replace one H with -OH. So for each -OH, the formula changes by +O and 0 H (since we add one H from -OH but lose one H from the carbon).\n\nSo for two -OH groups, the formula is C3H8 - 2H + 2O = C3H6O2. Correct.\n\nSo the formula is C3H6O2.\n\nWhen we attach the aniline group, we remove one H from the carbon chain and one H from the aniline group, giving C3H5O2 + C6H6N.\n\nSo the total H is 5 + 6 = 11.\n\nBut in the structure, it's 12 H. This suggests a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's calculate the molecular formula using the structure and then calculate the molar mass.\n\nStructure: HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nLet's count each atom:\n\nCarbon (C):\n\n- 3 from the propane chain\n- 6 from the benzene ring\nTotal: 9 C.\n\nHydrogen (H):\n\n- 3 from HO-CH2-\n- 2 from CH(OH)-\n- 1 from CH-NH-\n- 1 from NH group\n- 5 from C6H5\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 12 H.\n\nOxygen (O):\n\n- 2 from the two OH groups\nTotal: 2 O.\n\nNitrogen (N):\n\n- 1 from the NH group\nTotal: 1 N.\n\nSo molecular formula is C9H12O2N.\n\nNow, let's calculate the molar mass:\n\nC: 9 * 12.01 = 108.09\nH: 12 * 1.008 = 12.096\nO: 2 * 16.00 = 32.00\nN: 1 * 14.01 = 14.01\n\nTotal: 108.09 + 12.096 + 32.00 + 14.01 = 166.196 g/mol.\n\nThis is approximately 166.20 g/mol, which is very close to option C: 167.200 g/mol. The slight difference could be due to rounding of atomic masses.\n\nLet me check the atomic masses again with more precision.\n\nCarbon: 12.011 g/mol\nHydrogen: 1.008 g/mol\nOxygen: 15.999 g/mol\nNitrogen: 14.007 g/mol\n\nNow, let's recalculate with more precise values:\n\nC: 9 * 12.011 = 108.099 g/mol\nH: 12 * 1.008 = 12.096 g/mol\nO: 2 * 15.999 = 31.998 g/mol\nN: 1 * 14.007 = 14.007 g/mol\n\nAdding them up:\n\n108.099 + 12.096 = 120.195\n120.195 + 31.998 = 152.193\n152.193 + 14.007 = 166.200 g/mol.\n\nAh! With more precise atomic masses, the molar mass is exactly 166.200 g/mol. This matches option C: 167.200 g/mol if there was a rounding difference. Wait, no, it's 166.200, but the option C is 167.200. There's a discrepancy of 1 g/mol.\n\nWhere is this coming from?\n\nLet me check my molecular formula again. Is it C9H12O2N?\n\nLet me count the atoms once more in the structure:\n\nHO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nCarbon: 3 (propane) + 6 (benzene) = 9 C. Correct.\nHydrogen: 3 (from first part) + 2 (second part) + 1 (third part) + 1 (NH) + 5 (benzene) = 12 H. Correct.\nOxygen: 2 O. Correct.\nNitrogen: 1 N. Correct.\n\nSo molecular formula is C9H12O2N.\n\nWith precise atomic masses, molar mass is 166.200 g/mol.\n\nBut the options given are:\n\nA: 159.230\nB: 131.130\nC: 167.200\nD: 179.260\n\nMy calculation gives 166.200 g/mol, which is very close to option C: 167.200 g/mol. The difference could be due to rounding during the calculation. Let me check if I made a mistake in counting the H.\n\nLet me re-count the H with precise attention:\n\nStructure: HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-NH-C6H5.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n1. HO-CH2-: This is the first carbon, which is CH2OH. The CH2 has two H attached to the carbon, and the OH has one H. Total 3 H.\n2. CH(OH)-: The second carbon is CH(OH). The carbon has one H attached (CH), and the OH has one H. Total 2 H.\n3. CH-NH-: The third carbon is CH-NH. The carbon has one H attached (CH). Total 1 H.\n4. NH group: The nitrogen has one H attached. Total 1 H.\n5. C6H5: The benzene ring has five H.\n\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 12 H. Correct.\n\nSo the molecular formula is C9H12O2N, with a molar mass of 166.200 g/mol.\n\nBut the closest option is C: 167.200 g/mol. This suggests that either there's a mistake in my calculation or in the options.\n\nLet me check if there's an error in the structure. Perhaps the aniline group is attached differently, leading to an additional H.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed an H in the carbon chain.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the third carbon has two H instead of one.\n\nIf the structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5, then the third carbon is CH2-NH-.\n\nLet's recalculate the H in this case.\n\nCarbon 1: 3 H\nCarbon 2: 2 H\nCarbon 3: 2 H\nNH group: 1 H\nBenzene ring: 5 H\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 13 H.\n\nMolecular formula: C9H13O2N.\n\nMolar mass calculation:\n\nC: 9 * 12.011 = 108.099\nH: 13 * 1.008 = 13.104\nO: 2 * 15.999 = 31.998\nN: 1 * 14.007 = 14.007\n\nTotal: 108.099 + 13.104 = 121.203 + 31.998 = 153.201 + 14.007 = 167.208 g/mol.\n\nThis rounds to 167.21 g/mol, which matches option C: 167.200 g/mol.\n\nBut why did I initially think that the third carbon should have one H instead of two? Because I believed that attaching the aniline group to the third carbon would replace one H, making it CH-NH- instead of CH2-NH-.\n\nHowever, if the IUPAC name is (2R)-3-anilinopropane-1,2-diol, the aniline group is attached to carbon 3, which in the propane-1,2-diol is CH2-.\n\nIf the propane-1,2-diol is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-, then attaching the aniline group to carbon 3 would leave the third carbon as CH2-NH-.\n\nThis would mean that the third carbon still has two H, and the attachment of the aniline group doesn't remove a H from the carbon chain, but rather replaces one H from the aniline group.\n\nWait, this suggests that my earlier assumption about removing a H from the carbon chain was incorrect.\n\nLet me think about this. When attaching the aniline group to the carbon chain, we are forming a bond between the carbon and the nitrogen of the aniline group. This means that one H from the aniline group is replaced by the carbon chain, but the carbon chain doesn't lose a H. Instead, the carbon chain has a bond to the nitrogen, and the nitrogen has one fewer H.\n\nSo the carbon chain remains CH2-, and the aniline group is attached as NH-.\n\nLet me clarify with an example. Suppose we have a carbon with CH2- and we attach an NH group to it. The carbon would have a bond to the nitrogen, and the nitrogen would have one fewer H.\n\nSo the structure would be CH2-NH-.\n\nIn this case, the carbon chain doesn't lose a H; it simply has a bond to the nitrogen. The nitrogen loses one H.\n\nSo the original carbon chain has two H on the third carbon, and the aniline group has one fewer H.\n\nThis would mean that the total H in the molecule is 13, as in the initial calculation.\n\nThis would explain why option C is 167.200 g/mol.\n\nLet me recalculate the molecular formula with this structure: HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5.\n\nCarbon: 9\nHydrogen: 13\nOxygen: 2\nNitrogen: 1\n\nMolar mass: 167.20 g/mol, which matches option C.\n\nSo where was the earlier mistake?\n\nI incorrectly assumed that attaching the aniline group to the carbon chain would replace one H from the carbon chain, but in reality, it replaces one H from the aniline group, leaving the carbon chain's H unchanged.\n\nThis is because the carbon chain has a bond to the nitrogen, and the nitrogen loses one H to form that bond, not the carbon.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NH-C6H5, with 13 H, leading to a molar mass of 167.20 g/mol, which is option C.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation where I initially counted 13 H, and after correcting the formula approach, it also leads to 167.20 g/mol.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: 167.200 g/mol.\n</think>"}
