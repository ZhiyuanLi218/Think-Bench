So, there's a disk rolling without slipping on the x-axis, and a rod that's in contact with the disk. The rod is also in non-slipping contact, and one end is sliding along the x-axis. We need to find the velocity relationship at the contact point between the disk and the x-axis when the disk is in pure rolling motion, and express it as a geometric constraint equation.\n\nFirst, let me recall what pure rolling motion means. If an object is rolling without slipping, the point of contact with the surface is instantaneously at rest relative to the surface. So, for the disk, the velocity of the contact point with the x-axis should be zero. That's a key point.\n\nNow, the disk has radius R, and its center of mass is at position x₂. Since it's rolling without slipping, the relationship between the translational velocity of the center of mass and the angular velocity should be such that the bottom point is stationary. The center of mass velocity is v₂ = dx₂/dt, and the angular velocity is ω₂ = dθ₂/dt. For pure rolling, the velocity due to rotation at the bottom point is Rω₂, but since it's in the opposite direction to the translational velocity, we have v₂ = Rω₂. So, the velocity of the center is equal to R times the angular velocity. Therefore, the constraint equation would be v₂ - Rω₂ = 0, or in terms of derivatives, dx₂/dt - R dθ₂/dt = 0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to \"calculate the velocity relationship at the contact point between the disk and the x-axis when the disk is in pure rolling motion, and express it as a geometric constraint equation.\" So maybe they just want the equation that enforces the no-slip condition. Which is indeed that the velocity of the contact point is zero. Since the contact point is the bottom of the disk, its velocity is the velocity of the center minus the rotational velocity. So:\n\nv_contact = v₂ - Rω₂ = 0.\n\nExpressed as a constraint equation, this would be:\n\ndx₂/dt - R dθ₂/dt = 0.\n\nBut maybe they want it in terms of positions? Because geometric constraint equations are usually in terms of coordinates, not velocities. So integrating that, we would get x₂ - Rθ₂ = constant? But if the disk starts from rest, maybe the constant is zero? Wait, no, actually, if the disk rolls without slipping, then over time, the distance rolled out is equal to the arc length rotated. So if the disk rotates by an angle θ₂, then the center has moved by Rθ₂. Therefore, the position of the center x₂ = Rθ₂ + x₀, where x₀ is the initial position. If we take x₀ = 0 for simplicity, then x₂ = Rθ₂. Therefore, the geometric constraint is x₂ - Rθ₂ = 0. But if we take time derivatives, we get the velocity constraint dx₂/dt - R dθ₂/dt = 0. So depending on whether they want the velocity or the geometric constraint. The problem says \"velocity relationship... express it as a geometric constraint equation.\" Hmm. Maybe they want the geometric one. Let me check.\n\nWait, the term \"geometric constraint equation\" usually refers to a relationship between coordinates, not velocities. So if the pure rolling condition is a geometric constraint, then it's x₂ = Rθ₂ + constant. Since the problem mentions \"during motion, both the disk and the rod remain within the same vertical plane,\" maybe we can assume initial conditions where at some initial time, say t=0, x₂ = Rθ₂. Therefore, the geometric constraint equation is x₂ - Rθ₂ = 0.\n\nBut let me confirm. For pure rolling without slipping, the instantaneous velocity of the contact point is zero, which leads to the condition v = Rω. If you integrate that over time, assuming no slipping, then the position of the center is x₂ = Rθ₂ + x_initial. If we take x_initial as zero when θ₂ is zero, then x₂ = Rθ₂. So yes, the geometric constraint is x₂ - Rθ₂ = 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer for part 2 is x₂ = Rθ₂. But maybe written as x₂ - Rθ₂ = 0. Depending on how the question wants it. The problem says \"express it as a geometric constraint equation,\" so likely in the form of an equation set to zero. So I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't something else. The question mentions the rod as well, but part 2 is specifically about the velocity relationship at the contact point between the disk and the x-axis. So the rod's presence might be relevant for other parts, but not for this specific question. So part 2 is only about the disk's pure rolling condition.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the geometric constraint equation is x₂ - Rθ₂ = 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe geometric constraint equation for the disk's pure rolling motion is \\boxed{x_2 - R\\theta_2 = 0}.\n</think>"}
