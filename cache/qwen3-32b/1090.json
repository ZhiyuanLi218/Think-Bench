So the question is about a parallel plate capacitor with mica dielectric that's connected to a constant voltage DC power supply. Then they remove the mica dielectric and ask what happens to the charge and electric field. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic formulas related to capacitors and dielectrics. The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by C = ε₀ε_r * (A/d), where ε_r is the relative permittivity or dielectric constant of the material between the plates. Mica has a dielectric constant higher than 1, so when it's present, the capacitance is higher compared to when there's just air or vacuum.\n\nSince the capacitor is connected to a constant voltage source, the voltage V across the capacitor remains constant. The charge Q on the capacitor is given by Q = C*V. So if the capacitance changes when the dielectric is removed, the charge will also change.\n\nWhen the mica is removed, the dielectric constant ε_r decreases from that of mica to 1 (assuming air replaces it, which has ε_r ≈ 1). Therefore, the capacitance C decreases because C is directly proportional to ε_r. Since the voltage V is constant, Q = C*V must decrease as well. So the charge on the plates should decrease.\n\nNow, what about the electric field between the plates? The electric field E in a parallel plate capacitor is given by E = V/d, where d is the separation between the plates. Since the voltage V is constant and d doesn't change when the dielectric is removed, the electric field E should remain the same. Alternatively, another formula for electric field is E = σ/(ε₀ε_r), where σ is the surface charge density. However, since the charge Q decreases when the dielectric is removed, σ (which is Q/A) also decreases. But ε_r decreases as well. Let me check if these two effects cancel out.\n\nOriginal E with dielectric: E1 = σ1/(ε₀ε_r) = (Q1/(A ε₀ ε_r)). Since Q1 = C1 V = ε₀ ε_r (A/d) V. So substituting, E1 = (ε₀ ε_r (A/d) V / A ε₀ ε_r) ) / d? Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, the electric field in a capacitor with dielectric is E = E0 / ε_r, where E0 is the electric field without the dielectric. But when you remove the dielectric, E would become E0. However, since the voltage is kept constant, let's think in terms of V = E*d. If V is constant and d is constant, then E must remain constant. Therefore, even after removing the dielectric, the electric field remains the same. But how does that reconcile with the other formula?\n\nWait, maybe I confused the formulas. Let me clarify. The electric field in a capacitor is E = σ / ε, where ε is the permittivity of the medium (ε = ε₀ ε_r). So with dielectric, E = σ / (ε₀ ε_r). Without dielectric, E' = σ' / ε₀. But if the voltage is kept constant, then V = E*d. So if E remains the same (since V and d are constant), then σ must adjust accordingly. \n\nBut when the dielectric is removed, the charge Q decreases because capacitance decreases. So σ = Q/A decreases. However, since E = σ / (ε₀ ε_r) when there's dielectric, and E' = σ' / ε₀ when there's no dielectric. If E remains the same (because V is constant and d is fixed), then:\n\nE = σ / (ε₀ ε_r) = σ' / ε₀ => σ' = σ / ε_r. \n\nSince σ' is Q'/A and σ is Q/A, then Q' = Q / ε_r. Which makes sense because Q' = C' V and Q = C V, and since C' = C / ε_r, then Q' = Q / ε_r. \n\nSo in this case, the electric field remains the same, and the charge decreases. Looking at the options, option D says \"The amount of charge on the plates decreases, and the electric field intensity between the plates remains unchanged.\" So that would be option D.\n\nLet me check the options again to make sure:\n\n(A) Charge increases, E increases – no, charge decreases.\n\n(B) Charge decreases, E increases – no, E remains same.\n\n(C) Charge increases, E same – no.\n\n(D) Charge decreases, E same – yes. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
