Then, using that matrix A, I need to compute A times another vector [-13, 3, 4]. \n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify the size of matrix A. Hmm, since it's multiplying a 3-dimensional vector, A must be a 3x3 matrix, right? Because if you multiply a 3x3 matrix by a 3x1 vector, you get a 3x1 vector. So A is 3x3. \n\nBut how do I find A? Well, if I can figure out the entries of A, then I can multiply it by the third vector. However, with just two equations, I might not have enough information to determine all 9 entries of A. Maybe there's another way. \n\nWait, maybe the vector [-13, 3, 4] can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors [3, 1, 0] and [-5, 2, 2]. If I can find scalars c1 and c2 such that:\n\nc1*[3, 1, 0] + c2*[-5, 2, 2] = [-13, 3, 4]\n\nThen, since matrix multiplication is linear, A times that combination would be c1*A*[3,1,0] + c2*A*[-5,2,2], which we already know. So maybe I can find c1 and c2 first?\n\nLet me try that. Let's set up the equations:\n\n3c1 - 5c2 = -13  \n1c1 + 2c2 = 3  \n0c1 + 2c2 = 4\n\nWait, the third equation is 0c1 + 2c2 = 4. That simplifies to 2c2 = 4, so c2 = 2. Then plug back into the second equation: c1 + 2*2 = 3 => c1 = 3 - 4 = -1. Let me check if these values satisfy the first equation:\n\n3*(-1) -5*(2) = -3 -10 = -13. Yes, that works! Perfect. So c1 is -1 and c2 is 2. \n\nTherefore, the vector [-13, 3, 4] is equal to -1*[3,1,0] + 2*[-5,2,2]. \n\nTherefore, A*[-13, 3, 4] should be -1*A*[3,1,0] + 2*A*[-5,2,2] = -1*[2,4,-3] + 2*[0,-5,-5]. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute -1*[2,4,-3] = [-2, -4, 3]\n\nThen compute 2*[0, -5, -5] = [0, -10, -10]\n\nAdd them together:\n\n[-2 + 0, -4 + (-10), 3 + (-10)] = [-2, -14, -7]\n\nSo the result should be [-2, -14, -7]. \n\nWait, but hold on, the third component of the original vector is 4. But when we expressed [-13, 3, 4], the third component came from 0*c1 + 2*c2. Since c2 is 2, 2*2 is 4, which matches. So that's correct. Therefore, the calculation seems valid. \n\nBut let me just check again. \n\nOriginal equations:\n\n3c1 -5c2 = -13  \nc1 + 2c2 = 3  \n2c2 = 4 => c2 = 2. Then c1 = 3 - 2*2 = -1. Then 3*(-1) -5*(2) = -3 -10 = -13. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the combination is correct. Then applying linearity:\n\nA*(-1*[3,1,0] + 2*[-5,2,2]) = -1*A*[3,1,0] + 2*A*[-5,2,2] = -1*[2,4,-3] + 2*[0,-5,-5] = [-2, -4, 3] + [0, -10, -10] = [-2, -14, -7]. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be [-2, -14, -7]. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Find A * vector\", so I need to present it as a vector. Let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. \n\nCalculating the first component: -1*2 + 2*0 = -2 + 0 = -2. \n\nSecond component: -1*4 + 2*(-5) = -4 -10 = -14. \n\nThird component: -1*(-3) + 2*(-5) = 3 -10 = -7. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the result is [-2; -14; -7]. \n\nBut let me think again. Is there a possibility that the matrix A is not uniquely determined by those two equations, but still, the action of A on the third vector is uniquely determined? \n\nSince the two original vectors [3,1,0] and [-5,2,2] might form a basis for a subspace, and if the vector [-13, 3, 4] lies in that subspace, then even if A is not uniquely determined, its action on that vector is determined by linearity. \n\nBut in this case, we were able to express the third vector as a combination of the first two vectors. However, since we have a third component, we need to check if those two vectors actually span the space or not. Wait, they are two vectors in R^3, so they can't span the entire space, but the third vector lies in their span, as we found coefficients. \n\nSo even though there are infinitely many matrices A satisfying the given conditions, when acting on vectors in the span of those two original vectors, A is uniquely determined. Therefore, the answer is unique. \n\nTherefore, the answer is [-2, -14, -7]. \n\nBut let me check once more. Let me try to think if there's another approach. For example, maybe trying to find the matrix A. \n\nBut since we have two equations, but A has 9 variables. However, if we assume that the two given vectors are linearly independent, then we can express A in terms of those. \n\nLet me check if [3,1,0] and [-5,2,2] are linearly independent. \n\nTo check linear independence, suppose a*[3,1,0] + b*[-5,2,2] = 0. \n\nWhich gives:\n\n3a -5b = 0  \n1a + 2b = 0  \n0a + 2b = 0 \n\nFrom the third equation: 2b = 0 => b=0. Then from the second equation, a = 0. Therefore, they are linearly independent. \n\nTherefore, they form a basis for a 2-dimensional subspace of R^3. Since the vector we are supposed to find lies in that subspace, as we saw, then the action of A on that vector is uniquely determined. \n\nTherefore, our previous calculation is valid. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the entire matrix A, I would need more information. But since the problem doesn't require that, and since the third vector is in the span of the first two, we don't need more information. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is [-2, -14, -7]. \n\nWait, but let me check once more the calculation for the third component. Original A*v1 = [2,4,-3], so -1 times that is [-2, -4, 3]. Then A*v2 = [0, -5, -5], times 2 is [0, -10, -10]. Adding them together, third component is 3 + (-10) = -7. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo I think that's correct. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other way this could go wrong. For example, if the two vectors weren't linearly independent, but we saw they are. If the third vector wasn't in their span, but we saw it is. So everything seems okay. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -14 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -14 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix}}\n</think>"}
