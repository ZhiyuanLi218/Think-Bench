Initial Setup and Energy Levels**\n\nThe particle is initially in a one-dimensional infinite potential well (also known as a particle in a box), with the well extending from $ x = 0 $ to $ x = a $. The energy levels for a particle in such a well are quantized and given by:\n\n$$\nE_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m a^2}\n$$\n\nIn this problem, the given energy $ E $ corresponds to the **ground state energy**, i.e., $ n = 1 $:\n\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m a^2}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **2. Adiabatic Process and Final Energy**\n\nThe wall is moved **slowly**, which implies an **adiabatic process** in quantum mechanics. According to the adiabatic theorem, if the Hamiltonian (i.e., the system's energy function) changes slowly, the system remains in the **same quantum state**, though the Hamiltonian itself evolves.\n\nSo, if the particle is initially in the **ground state** ($ n = 1 $) when the width is $ a $, it will remain in the **ground state** when the width is increased to $ 4a $.\n\nThe new ground state energy is:\n\n$$\nE'_1 = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m (4a)^2} = \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m a^2} = \\frac{E}{16}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **3. Work Done on the System**\n\nIn thermodynamics, the **work done on the system** is given by the change in internal energy when the process is adiabatic (no heat exchange). So:\n\n$$\nW = \\Delta E = E_{\\text{final}} - E_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{E}{16} - E = -\\frac{15}{16} E\n$$\n\nThis negative sign indicates that the system is **losing energy** during the process, which means **work is done by the system**, or equivalently, **work is done on the system** with a negative value.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Interpretation of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks for the **work done in this process to move the wall**, which refers to the **work done on the system** (i.e., the particle). Hence, the correct answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{15}{16} E}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the work done when moving a wall of an infinite potential well from position x=a to x=4a slowly. The answer should be in terms of E, which is given as E = π²ħ²/(2ma²). The options are A to D, with different coefficients. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, an infinite potential well (also called a particle in a box) has certain energy levels. The energy levels are quantized and given by the formula E_n = n²π²ħ²/(2ma²), where n is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). In this case, the original energy E is given as π²ħ²/(2ma²), which corresponds to n=1, the ground state energy.\n\nNow, the problem says the wall is moved slowly from x=a to x=4a. Moving slowly probably means that the process is adiabatic, right? So the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics says that if a system starts in an eigenstate and the Hamiltonian changes slowly, the system remains in the same eigenstate, just with the changing Hamiltonian. Therefore, if the particle was initially in the ground state (n=1) when the width was a, then after moving the wall slowly to 4a, it should still be in the ground state (n=1) but for the new width.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the particle after the expansion would be E'_1 = π²ħ²/(2m(4a)²) = π²ħ²/(2m*16a²) = (1/16) * π²ħ²/(2ma²) = E/16.\n\nSo the initial energy was E, and the final energy is E/16. Therefore, the work done on the system would be the change in energy? Wait, but work done by the system or on the system? Hmm. Let me think.\n\nIn thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered negative if work is done on the system. But here, since the wall is being moved outward, the system (the particle) is doing work on the environment? Or is work being done on the system?\n\nWait, when you expand the wall, the particle's energy decreases. So the system is losing energy. If the process is adiabatic and slow, then the energy lost by the system is the work done by the system. Therefore, the work done by the system would be initial energy minus final energy: E - E/16 = (15/16)E. But since the question asks for the work done in this process to move the wall, which is work done on the system? Or by the system?\n\nWait, if the wall is moved outward, the system is expanding, so the system is doing work on the surroundings. Therefore, the work done by the system is positive (15/16)E, so the work done on the system would be negative, -15/16 E. However, looking at the options, option B is -(15/16) E. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think in terms of the work done by the external agent moving the wall. If the wall is moved slowly, then the force exerted by the particle on the wall would be balanced by the external agent. The work done by the external agent would be the integral of force times distance. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, since the process is slow, we can use the formula that the work done on the system is the change in energy. Since the energy decreases, the work done on the system is negative. But I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me recall the first law of thermodynamics: ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. If the process is adiabatic (no heat exchange), then Q=0, so ΔU = W. But in quantum mechanics, if the process is adiabatic (slow), then maybe it's analogous. However, in this case, since the particle is in an eigenstate, there is no heat, so the work done on the system would be the change in internal energy.\n\nWait, but the internal energy here is just the energy of the particle. So ΔU = U_final - U_initial = E/16 - E = -15E/16. Therefore, the work done on the system is -15E/16. Therefore, the answer would be B: -15/16 E. But let me check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the work done by considering the force. How would that work?\n\nIn classical mechanics, the force exerted by a particle in a box can be thought of as pressure on the walls. For a particle in a box, the force on the wall can be calculated by considering the momentum transfer during collisions. However, in quantum mechanics, for a stationary state, the expectation value of the force might be tricky. However, since the process is slow, maybe we can use the formula for the force as the negative derivative of energy with respect to position?\n\nWait, in thermodynamics, for a system with energy depending on volume, the pressure is given by P = -dE/dV. Similarly, here, if we think of the \"pressure\" on the wall, maybe it's related to the derivative of energy with respect to length.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's consider the energy as a function of the width of the box, L. Initially, L goes from a to 4a. The energy for the nth state is E_n(L) = n²π²ħ²/(2mL²). So, if we consider the force exerted by the particle on the wall, it would be F = -dE/dL. Because in thermodynamics, force is analogous to pressure, and work is F dL. So if we want to calculate the work done by the particle, it would be the integral of F dL from a to 4a.\n\nBut let's compute that. Let's take the derivative of E with respect to L:\n\ndE_n/dL = n²π²ħ²/(2m) * (-2)/L³ = -n²π²ħ²/(m L³)\n\nTherefore, the force is F = -dE/dL = n²π²ħ²/(m L³)\n\nBut since we are moving the wall from L = a to L = 4a, and assuming the particle stays in the ground state (n=1), then:\n\nF = (1)²π²ħ²/(m L³) = π²ħ²/(m L³)\n\nThen, the work done by the particle is the integral of F dL from a to 4a:\n\nW_by = ∫ F dL = ∫_{a}^{4a} [π²ħ²/(m L³)] dL\n\nLet me compute that integral:\n\n∫ [π²ħ²/(m L³)] dL = π²ħ²/m ∫ L^{-3} dL = π²ħ²/m [ (-1/(2 L²)) ] evaluated from a to 4a.\n\nSo:\n\nπ²ħ²/m [ (-1/(2*(4a)^2) + 1/(2*a^2)) ] = π²ħ²/m [ (-1/(32 a²) + 1/(2 a²)) ] = π²ħ²/m [ ( -1/32 + 16/32 ) /a² ] = π²ħ²/m [ 15/(32 a²) ]\n\nTherefore, W_by = 15 π²ħ²/(32 m a² )\n\nBut E is given as π²ħ²/(2 m a²). Let me write that:\n\nE = π²ħ²/(2 m a²) => π²ħ²/(m a²) = 2E\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nW_by = 15/(32) * 2E = 15/16 E\n\nTherefore, the work done by the particle is 15/16 E. Therefore, the work done on the particle is -15/16 E. Which matches the previous result. Therefore, the answer is B: -15/16 E.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake here. The question says \"calculate the work done in this process to move the wall\". So if moving the wall requires work, is it the work done by the external agent or by the system? In the calculation above, the work done by the system is positive 15/16 E, so the work done by the external agent is -15/16 E. Since the question says \"work done in this process to move the wall\", which is probably referring to the work done by the external agent, which is -15/16 E. Hence, answer B.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the energy difference is the work done, then since the energy decreased by 15/16 E, maybe they think that the work done is -15/16 E. So that's consistent.\n\nBut let me think again. In thermodynamics, if you have a gas expanding, the work done by the gas is PdV, and the work done on the gas is -PdV. Similarly here, when the wall is moved outward, the system (particle) is doing positive work on the environment, so the work done on the system is negative. Therefore, the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me check another approach. Let me think about the energy levels. Initially, the particle is in the ground state with energy E_1 = E. After expansion, the new ground state energy is E'_1 = E/16. If the process is adiabatic, the particle remains in the ground state, so the energy goes from E to E/16. Therefore, the change in energy is ΔE = E/16 - E = -15E/16. Since the work done on the system is equal to the change in energy (assuming no heat transfer), then W = ΔE = -15E/16. Therefore, again answer B.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, so I think B is correct. However, let me check why some people might think of other options.\n\nFor example, maybe someone could think that the work done is the average of something or miscalculates the integral. Let me check my integral again:\n\nThe integral ∫_{a}^{4a} [π²ħ²/(m L³)] dL.\n\nLet me compute it again:\n\nIntegral of L^{-3} is [L^{-2}/(-2)] + C. Therefore:\n\nπ²ħ²/m [ -1/(2L²) ] from a to 4a:\n\nAt upper limit 4a: -1/(2*(4a)^2) = -1/(32 a²)\n\nAt lower limit a: -1/(2a²)\n\nSubtracting lower limit from upper limit:\n\n[-1/(32 a²) - (-1/(2a²))] = -1/(32 a²) + 1/(2a²) = ( -1 + 16 ) / 32 a² = 15/(32 a²)\n\nMultiply by π²ħ²/m:\n\nπ²ħ²/(m) * 15/(32 a²) = 15 π²ħ²/(32 m a²)\n\nBut E = π²ħ²/(2 m a²), so π²ħ²/(m a²) = 2E. Hence:\n\n15/(32) * 2E = 15/16 E. Yes, correct. So work done by the system is 15/16 E, work done on the system is -15/16 E. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA: -7/16 E\n\nB: -15/16 E\n\nC: 63/128 E\n\nD: -63/64 E\n\nSo B is there. Therefore, the answer is B. However, I want to make sure that there isn't another approach where the work is calculated differently. For example, if someone thought that the particle is in the same energy level during the process, but that's not possible because the energy levels depend on the width. Since it's adiabatic, it stays in the same quantum number, so n=1 throughout.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the work is calculated by considering the average force over distance or something else. But no, the integral seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the energy is not E/16 but something else. Let me check E'_1:\n\nOriginal E_n = n² π²ħ²/(2 m a²). If the length becomes 4a, then E'_n = n² π²ħ²/(2 m (4a)^2) = E_n / 16. So for n=1, E'_1 = E /16. Correct.\n\nTherefore, ΔE = E/16 - E = -15E/16. Since the work done on the system is equal to ΔE (because Q=0), then W = -15E/16. So answer is B.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
