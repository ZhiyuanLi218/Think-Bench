So, Anh is reading a book, and the problem gives me some information about how many pages she reads each day and how long it takes her. The goal is to find n + t, where n is the number of pages she read on the first day and t is the number of minutes it took her that day. The book has 374 pages total, and it took her 319 minutes total. Each day, she reads one more page than the previous day and also takes one more minute than the previous day. \n\nFirst, let me try to model this. Let me think. On day 1, pages = n, time = t. Day 2, pages = n + 1, time = t + 1. Then day 3 would be n + 2 pages and t + 2 minutes, and so on. She continues this until she finishes the book. So, the number of days she reads depends on how many pages she needs to finish the book. \n\nLet me denote the number of days she reads as k. Then, on day k, she would read n + (k - 1) pages and spend t + (k - 1) minutes. \n\nThe total number of pages she reads is the sum from day 1 to day k of [n + (i - 1)] where i goes from 1 to k. Similarly, the total time is the sum from day 1 to day k of [t + (i - 1)]. \n\nSo, total pages: sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (n + i) = k*n + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = k*n + [k(k - 1)/2]. Similarly for total time: k*t + [k(k - 1)/2]. \n\nGiven that total pages is 374 and total time is 319. So we have two equations:\n\n1. k*n + k(k - 1)/2 = 374\n2. k*t + k(k - 1)/2 = 319\n\nSo, if I subtract the two equations, I get:\n\nk*n - k*t = 374 - 319 = 55. Therefore, k(n - t) = 55.\n\nHmm. Interesting. Also, if I look at the equations, since both have the same quadratic term, maybe we can find k first? Let me think. Let me note that n and t are positive integers. Also, k must be a positive integer as well. \n\nSo, from the first equation: k*n + k(k - 1)/2 = 374. Similarly, second equation: k*t + k(k - 1)/2 = 319. Let me denote S = k(k - 1)/2. Then, the first equation becomes k*n + S = 374 and the second is k*t + S = 319. Therefore, subtracting, we get k(n - t) = 55. \n\nSo, k divides 55. The factors of 55 are 1, 5, 11, 55. Since k is the number of days, and she reads more pages each day, starting from n pages. Let's check possible k values.\n\nFirst, let me check k=1: If k=1, then n*1 + 1*(0)/2 = n = 374. Similarly, t*1 + 0 = t = 319. Then n + t = 374 + 319 = 693. But let me check if that's possible. If k=1, that means she read the whole book in one day, but the problem says \"each day thereafter...\", implying that there is more than one day? Wait, maybe not necessarily. The problem says \"on the first day... on the second day... each day thereafter...\" So if k=2, then there are two days. But if k=1, there is only one day. But the problem mentions \"on the second day\" so maybe there must be at least two days? Wait, maybe not necessarily. If k=1, there is only one day, so there is no second day. But the problem says \"On the first day... On the second day...\" So perhaps k must be at least 2? Let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"On the first day she read n pages in t minutes... On the second day Anh read n + 1 pages... Each day thereafter...\" So, if k=2, then there is a first day, second day, and then \"each day thereafter\", but if k=2, there are no days thereafter. So maybe k can be 2? But the problem says \"until she completely read the book\". So, if the book was finished on the second day, that's okay. However, the problem mentions \"each day thereafter\", so maybe k is at least 2? But maybe not necessarily. Let me check if k=1 is possible. If k=1, then n = 374 and t=319. Then n - t would be 374 - 319 = 55, so k(n - t) = 1*55=55, which matches. So according to the equations, k=1 is a possible solution. However, the problem says \"on the second day\", so maybe k must be at least 2? Let me check.\n\nBut maybe the problem is structured so that there are multiple days. Let me check for k=5, 11, 55. Let's see. Let's check each possible k.\n\nPossible k values are 1,5,11,55. Let's check each.\n\nFirst, k=1:\n\nAs above, n=374, t=319. Then n + t= 693. But since the problem mentions the second day, maybe this is invalid? Let me check if the problem requires her to have multiple days. The problem says \"On the first day... On the second day... Each day thereafter...\" So if she finished on the second day, that would be k=2. But since k must divide 55, and 2 does not divide 55, k=2 is not possible. So if k=1 is possible but contradicts the problem's wording, perhaps k is 5, 11, or 55. Let's check.\n\nk=5:\n\nk=5. Then from k(n - t)=55, we have 5(n - t)=55 => n - t = 11. So n = t + 11.\n\nNow, let's compute total pages. From equation 1:\n\nk*n + k(k - 1)/2 = 5n + 5*4/2 = 5n + 10 = 374. Therefore, 5n = 374 -10= 364 => n= 364 /5= 72.8. But n must be integer. So this is invalid. Therefore, k=5 is invalid. \n\nHmm, so k=5 doesn't work. Next, k=11:\n\nk=11. Then from k(n - t)=55 => 11(n - t)=55 => n - t=5 => n= t +5.\n\nNow, total pages: 11n + 11*10/2 = 11n + 55= 374. Therefore, 11n= 374 -55= 319. Therefore, n=319 /11. Let me compute 11*29= 319? 11*29= 319. Yes, because 11*30=330, so 330 -11= 319. So n=29. Wait, 11*29=319? Wait 29*10=290, 29*1=29, so 290 +29=319. Yes. So n=29. Therefore, since n= t +5, then t= n -5=29 -5=24. Therefore, n + t=29 +24=53. \n\nBut let me check if this works with the time equation. Let's check total time. Total time is k*t + k(k -1)/2= 11*24 + 55. 11*24 is 264. 264 +55= 319. Which matches the given total time. Perfect. So that works. \n\nNow let me check k=55. \n\nk=55. Then k(n - t)=55 => 55(n - t)=55 => n - t=1 => n = t +1.\n\nTotal pages: 55n + 55*54/2= 55n + (55*27)= 55n + 1485= 374. Therefore, 55n= 374 -1485= negative number. Which is impossible. So k=55 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, only possible k is 11, giving n + t=53. But let me check if k=1 is possible. If k=1, then n=374, t=319. But since the problem mentions the second day, but if she finished on the first day, then there is no second day. However, maybe the problem allows for k=1? But given that the problem says \"on the second day\", maybe k must be at least 2. However, if k=1 is allowed, then there are two solutions. But the problem says \"find n + t\", implying a unique answer. Therefore, probably k=11 is the correct one. Also, with k=1, n and t are 374 and 319, which are positive integers, but maybe the problem expects that she reads for multiple days. Also, if you think about the pages and time, if she reads 374 pages in 319 minutes on day 1, that would mean she is reading more pages per minute than on subsequent days? Wait, but on subsequent days, she reads more pages but also takes more time. However, if there are no subsequent days, then maybe it's okay. But since the problem mentions the second day, maybe k=2 is required? But k=2 is not a divisor of 55. So since k must divide 55, possible k's are 1,5,11,55. We saw that only k=11 gives integer solutions. Therefore, the answer is 53. \n\nBut let me check again for k=11. Let me verify the total pages and total time. \n\nNumber of days: 11. \n\nPages per day:\n\nDay 1: 29 pages\n\nDay 2: 30\n\nDay 3: 31\n\n...\n\nDay 11: 29 + 10 = 39 pages.\n\nTotal pages: sum from 29 to 39 inclusive. How many terms? 11 terms. The average is (29 + 39)/2= 34. Total pages: 34*11= 374. Correct. \n\nTotal time:\n\nDay 1: 24 minutes\n\nDay 2: 25\n\n...\n\nDay 11: 24 + 10= 34 minutes.\n\nTotal time: sum from 24 to 34 inclusive. Number of terms 11. Average (24 + 34)/2=29. Total time: 29*11= 319. Correct. \n\nTherefore, this works perfectly. \n\nTherefore, n + t= 29 +24= 53. \n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities. For example, could there be a case where k is not a divisor of 55? Wait, earlier we had that k(n - t)=55. Since 55 factors into 5*11, and k must be positive integer, so k must divide 55. Therefore, only possible k's are 1,5,11,55. As checked above, only k=11 gives valid positive integers for n and t. So 53 is the answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 53. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{53}\n</think>"}
