The options are A through D, each giving different combinations of changes in speed, wavelength, frequency, etc. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when light travels from one medium to another, its speed changes. Air has a lower refractive index compared to glass. The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed in the medium. So, if the refractive index of glass is higher than air, the speed of light in glass should be slower than in air. So that would mean the beam slows down. That would eliminate options B and D, because they say speed remains unchanged or something else. Wait, no, let me check the options again.\n\nOption A says \"slows down, wavelength becomes shorter.\" Option B says \"speed remains unchanged, wavelength becomes shorter.\" Option C: \"frequency increases, wavelength becomes longer.\" Option D: \"frequency remains unchanged, wavelength becomes longer.\"\n\nSo if the speed decreases when entering glass, that would support option A or C or D. Wait, but the speed is definitely decreasing, so options B and D are out? Wait, no, option D says speed isn't mentioned directly, but if frequency remains unchanged and wavelength becomes longer, but speed is frequency times wavelength. If the speed is decreasing, and frequency is the same, then wavelength must decrease. Because v = fλ. If v decreases, and f is the same, then λ must decrease. So if the speed is slower in glass, then the wavelength is shorter. So that would support option A. Because option A says slows down (speed decreases) and wavelength becomes shorter. \n\nBut let me confirm. The frequency of light depends on the source, right? When light enters a different medium, the frequency doesn't change because the wave's source is the same. The frequency is determined by the source, so it stays the same. However, the speed changes, which affects the wavelength. Since v = fλ, if the speed v decreases and frequency f stays the same, then λ must decrease. So wavelength becomes shorter. So the correct answer would be option A: slows down, wavelength becomes shorter.\n\nLet me check if I made any mistakes here. So, when entering a medium with higher refractive index (like glass), speed decreases, frequency remains the same, wavelength decreases. So yes, option A is correct. The other options: B says speed unchanged but wavelength shorter, which would require frequency to increase (since v is same, λ shorter would mean f higher), but that's not the case. Option C says frequency increases, which is wrong. Option D says frequency remains the same but wavelength becomes longer, which would require speed to increase, but speed decreases. So D is wrong. So A is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
