Let me start by recalling what a geostationary satellite is. They orbit the Earth in such a way that their orbital period matches the Earth's rotational period, so they stay fixed over a point on the equator. The current orbital radius is 6.6 times Earth's radius. \n\nNow, if the Earth's rotation slows down (i.e., the rotational period decreases?), wait, no—if the rotational period decreases, that means the Earth is spinning faster. Wait, the question says \"the Earth's rotational period decreases.\" So the day is shorter. But if the Earth is spinning faster, the geostationary satellites would need to orbit faster as well. But their orbital radius would have to be smaller because lower orbits have shorter periods. \n\nBut the problem says that we still use three satellites to cover any two points on the equator. So with three satellites, each satellite can cover a certain arc of the equator. The question is, how does the coverage depend on the orbital radius, and thus on the rotational period?\n\nFirst, let me think about the coverage area of a geostationary satellite. Since it's directly above the equator, the satellite can communicate with points on the Earth's surface up to a certain latitude. But since the question is about points on the equator, maybe we need to think about the angular distance between two points that can be covered by one satellite. \n\nImagine the satellite is at a certain height above the equator. The maximum distance between two points on the equator that can communicate through this satellite would depend on the angle subtended at the satellite. Alternatively, maybe the angle subtended at the Earth's center? Let me draw a diagram in my mind. The satellite is at radius r from Earth's center, Earth's radius is R. A point on the equator is at distance R from Earth's center. The satellite can communicate with points on Earth's surface where the line of sight isn't blocked. For equatorial communication, maybe the maximum angular separation between two points that can be covered by one satellite is determined by the geometry of the satellite's position relative to Earth.\n\nLet me think. If you have a satellite in geostationary orbit, the communication link between two points on the equator would require that both points are within the satellite's line of sight. The angle between the two points as seen from the satellite would determine how far apart they can be. Alternatively, maybe the angle between the points as seen from Earth's center?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angular coverage from the Earth's perspective. For a satellite at radius r, the coverage on Earth's surface is a circle. The radius of that circle can be found by considering the tangent lines from the satellite to the Earth's surface. The angle between the satellite's position and the tangent points would determine the angular coverage.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's denote the Earth's radius as R, and the satellite's orbital radius as r. The angle θ between the satellite and the edge of its coverage area (as seen from Earth's center) can be found using the triangle formed by the satellite, Earth's center, and the tangent point on Earth's surface. In this triangle, the line from the satellite to the tangent point is tangent to the Earth's surface, so it is perpendicular to the radius of the Earth at that tangent point. Therefore, we have a right triangle with sides R (Earth's radius), sqrt(r² - R²) (distance from satellite to tangent point), and hypotenuse r (distance from Earth's center to satellite). The angle at the Earth's center between the satellite and the tangent point is θ. \n\nIn this right triangle, cosθ = adjacent / hypotenuse = R / r. Therefore, θ = arccos(R / r). This angle θ is the angular radius of the coverage area on Earth as seen from Earth's center. Therefore, the satellite can cover a region on Earth's surface from (satellite position - θ) to (satellite position + θ). \n\nTherefore, the arc length covered by one satellite is 2θ. To cover the entire equator with three satellites, the sum of their coverage arcs should be at least 360 degrees. However, since they are spaced apart, each satellite must cover the angle between adjacent satellites. If we have three satellites equally spaced in orbit, they are separated by 120 degrees (360 / 3). Therefore, the coverage arc of each satellite must be at least 120 degrees to ensure that there's no gap between them. Wait, actually, the coverage arc needs to span the angular distance between adjacent satellites. Let me think again.\n\nIf three satellites are equally spaced around the orbit, each separated by 120 degrees. For there to be no gap in coverage, the coverage area of each satellite must reach from its position to halfway between the next satellite. Wait, no—if each satellite's coverage angle is 2θ, then to cover the entire equator, the angular distance between two adjacent satellites (120 degrees) must be less than or equal to 2θ. Wait, actually, if each satellite can cover an arc of 2θ on the equator, then to cover the entire equator with three satellites, the total coverage would be 3*(2θ) which must be at least 360 degrees. However, because the satellites are spaced apart, overlapping is necessary. However, if the satellites are spaced 120 degrees apart, each satellite's coverage must reach to the next satellite. Therefore, the angular radius θ must be at least half the angular separation between satellites. Wait, angular separation between satellites is 120 degrees. If each satellite covers an angle of 2θ, then θ must be at least 60 degrees so that 2θ = 120 degrees, which would just reach the next satellite. Therefore, θ ≥ 60 degrees. \n\nBut θ was defined as arccos(R / r). Therefore, arccos(R / r) ≥ 60 degrees. Therefore, R / r ≤ cos(60°) = 0.5. Therefore, r ≥ 2R. \n\nWait, currently, the orbital radius of geostationary satellites is 6.6 R. So currently, R / r is 1/6.6 ≈ 0.1515, so θ ≈ arccos(0.1515) ≈ 81.3 degrees. Therefore, each satellite covers about 162.6 degrees of the equator (2θ). With three satellites spaced 120 degrees apart, there is plenty of overlap. But if we want the minimum rotational period, which would correspond to the minimum orbital radius (since a shorter rotational period requires a lower geostationary orbit), such that θ = 60 degrees. Therefore, arccos(R / r) = 60 degrees => R / r = 0.5 => r = 2R. \n\nSo if the geostationary radius is 2R, then three satellites can just cover the equator. Therefore, we need to find what rotational period corresponds to a geostationary orbit of radius r = 2R. \n\nNow, we need to relate the orbital period to the radius. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (orbital radius). For Earth, the current geostationary orbit has a period of 24 hours (approximately, though more precisely it's about 23h56m, but maybe for this problem we can approximate it as 24h). However, since we need to find the period when the radius is 2R, we need to compare it to the current situation. \n\nBut wait, actually, we need to derive the period for a geostationary orbit at radius r, given that currently, when the period is T_current (which is the current rotational period of Earth, which is 24h), the radius is r_current = 6.6 R. But if Earth's rotational period decreases, the geostationary satellites must have a smaller orbital radius. But we need to find the minimum period, i.e., the period when the radius is as small as possible (r_min = 2R) to allow three satellites to cover the equator. \n\nSo using Kepler's third law, which is T² ∝ r³. Let me write that as T² = (4π² / GM) r³, but since we can take the ratio between the current situation and the new situation, we can write:\n\n(T_new / T_current)² = (r_new³) / (r_current³)\n\nTherefore, T_new = T_current * (r_new / r_current)^(3/2)\n\nBut here, T_current is the current Earth's rotational period, which is 24 hours. However, in the problem, we are to find the minimum value of Earth's rotational period. Wait, if Earth's rotational period decreases, then the geostationary satellites must have a shorter orbital period. Therefore, the new T_new is the new rotational period. \n\nGiven that currently, the geostationary radius is 6.6 R with T_current = 24 h. If we want to find T_new when r_new = 2 R, then:\n\nT_new = T_current * (r_new / r_current)^(3/2) = 24 h * (2 / 6.6)^(3/2)\n\nLet me compute that. First, 2 / 6.6 ≈ 0.303. Let me calculate (0.303)^(3/2). \n\nFirst, square root of 0.303 is approx sqrt(0.303) ≈ 0.55. Then multiply by 0.303: 0.55 * 0.303 ≈ 0.1666. Therefore, T_new ≈ 24 * 0.1666 ≈ 4 hours. \n\nSo approximately 4 hours. Therefore, the answer is (B) 4 h. \n\nWait, let me check my steps again. \n\nFirst, the coverage angle. If θ needs to be 60 degrees, then arccos(R / r) = 60 degrees => R / r = 0.5 => r = 2R. Correct. \n\nThen, using Kepler's law. The geostationary orbit period equals Earth's rotational period. So if Earth's rotational period is T, then the orbital period of the satellite must also be T. So using Kepler's third law, for Earth's satellites, T² = (4π² / (G M_E)) r³. Therefore, for two different satellites, T1² / T2² = r1³ / r2³. Therefore, T_new / T_current = (r_new / r_current)^(3/2). \n\nBut here, T_current is the current geostationary period (Earth's current rotational period) which is 24 hours. T_new is the new rotational period (shorter, since Earth is spinning faster). Therefore, T_new = T_current * (r_new / r_current)^(3/2). \n\nBut r_new is smaller than r_current. Therefore, T_new is smaller than T_current. Wait, but according to the formula above, if you take (r_new / r_current) which is less than 1, raised to 3/2, so T_new is smaller. Which makes sense: lower orbit has shorter period. So if Earth's rotation period is T_new, then the geostationary satellites must have that same period. Therefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\nr_new = 2 R\n\nr_current = 6.6 R\n\nTherefore, ratio r_new / r_current = 2 / 6.6 ≈ 0.303\n\n(0.303)^(3/2). Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute 0.303^(1/2):\n\n√0.303 ≈ 0.5505\n\nThen multiply by 0.303:\n\n0.5505 * 0.303 ≈ 0.1668\n\nTherefore, T_new ≈ 24 * 0.1668 ≈ 4.003 hours. So approximately 4 hours. Therefore, answer is B. \n\nBut let me check if my initial assumption about the angular coverage is correct. The key step was that θ must be at least 60 degrees so that 2θ = 120 degrees, allowing three satellites spaced 120 degrees apart to cover the entire equator. Is this correct?\n\nImagine three satellites equally spaced (every 120 degrees). Each satellite can cover an arc of 120 degrees centered on its position. Then, the coverage would just meet at the edges, with no overlap. However, in reality, for communication between any two points, if two points are separated by more than 120 degrees, then they would require two satellites. But the question says \"maintain radio communications between any two points on the Earth's equator.\" Does that mean that any two points can communicate directly via one satellite, or that the network of satellites allows for relaying?\n\nIf it's direct communication (i.e., line of sight between both points and the satellite), then for any two points on the equator, there must be at least one satellite that can \"see\" both points. In that case, the requirement is different. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose there are two points A and B on the equator. For there to be a satellite that can communicate with both A and B, the satellite must be within the coverage area of both A and B. In other words, A and B must both be within the satellite's coverage area. Therefore, the angular distance between A and B must be less than or equal to 2θ, where θ is the angular radius of the satellite's coverage. Wait, no. If A and B are both within the satellite's coverage, then the maximum angular distance between A and B would be 2*(angular radius from satellite). But the angular radius from the satellite's perspective is different from Earth's perspective.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the earlier calculation, where θ is the angle at Earth's center between the satellite and the edge of its coverage. Therefore, each satellite covers an arc of 2θ on the equator. For any two points on the equator, there must be at least one satellite such that both points lie within that satellite's 2θ arc. \n\nTo ensure this, the maximum angular distance between two points that can be covered by a single satellite is 2θ. Therefore, the question becomes: what is the maximum possible angular distance between two points on the equator, and we need 2θ to be at least that maximum distance divided by... Wait, no. Actually, with three satellites, each covering an arc of 2θ, spaced 120 degrees apart, what's the maximum distance between two points that can be covered by at least one satellite?\n\nImagine the worst case: two points that are as far apart as possible while still being covered by some satellite. If the satellites are spaced 120 degrees apart, then the furthest apart two points can be and still be covered by the same satellite would be when they are on opposite ends of a satellite's coverage arc. However, if two points are more than 2θ apart, they might not be covered by the same satellite. But we need that any two points can communicate via some satellite. Therefore, the maximum angular distance between two points on the equator is 180 degrees. For any two points, there must exist a satellite such that both points are within its coverage arc. \n\nThis is a covering problem. Let me think geometrically. If we have three satellites equally spaced, each covering an arc of 2θ, what should θ be so that any two points on the equator are within 2θ of some satellite?\n\nThe worst case is when the two points are separated by 180 degrees. For there to be a satellite that can cover both points, there must be a satellite such that both points are within its coverage arc. However, if two points are on opposite sides of the Earth (180 degrees apart), the satellite must be positioned such that both points lie within its 2θ arc. The midpoint between the two points would be 90 degrees from each. Therefore, if the satellite is located at that midpoint, then each point is 90 degrees away from the satellite. Therefore, the coverage arc needs to be at least 180 degrees (from one point to the other). Therefore, 2θ ≥ 180 degrees => θ ≥ 90 degrees. But that's impossible because θ is arccos(R / r), which for real satellites is less than 90 degrees (since R / r < 1). \n\nWait, this suggests a contradiction with my previous reasoning. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! My initial assumption that any two points can be covered by a single satellite is incorrect. In reality, with three satellites, communication between two points might require relaying through multiple satellites. However, the problem states \"maintain radio communications between any two points on the Earth's equator.\" If this requires direct line-of-sight (i.e., no relays), then three satellites might not be sufficient unless their coverage is large enough. However, if relays are allowed, then three satellites can cover the entire equator if each satellite can cover 120 degrees, so that adjacent satellites can relay signals. \n\nBut the question says \"radio communications between any two points,\" which might imply that there is a path through the satellites, not necessarily direct. In that case, the requirement is that the entire equator is covered by the satellites' coverage areas, allowing for relays. In this case, the satellites just need to have overlapping coverage such that the entire equator is covered. \n\nIf the satellites are spaced 120 degrees apart, and each covers an arc of 2θ, then to cover the entire equator, we need 2θ ≥ 120 degrees, so that each satellite covers the 120 degrees between itself and the next satellite. Wait, if each satellite covers 120 degrees, then three satellites would just cover the entire equator without gaps. Therefore, θ ≥ 60 degrees. Which was my original reasoning. \n\nBut in that case, if two points are separated by more than 120 degrees, they would be in different coverage areas, but communication would require going through another satellite. Therefore, the problem might be assuming that the communication can be relayed through the satellites, so that as long as the entire equator is covered, any two points can communicate via at most two satellites. \n\nTherefore, going back, my original calculation of θ ≥ 60 degrees is correct for full coverage with three satellites, leading to r = 2R. \n\nTherefore, the previous calculation of T ≈ 4 hours is correct. Therefore, the answer is (B) 4 h. \n\nBut let me verify with another approach. Let's compute the actual numbers. \n\nFirst, let's recall that for geostationary orbit, the period T is related to the radius r by Kepler's third law. The formula is:\n\nT² = (4π² / (G M_E)) r³\n\nBut we can also relate the current situation to the new situation without knowing G or M_E. \n\nLet me denote T_current = 24 h, r_current = 6.6 R.\n\nFor the new situation, T_new is what we need to find, with r_new = 2 R.\n\nTherefore, (T_new / T_current)² = (r_new / r_current)³ => T_new = T_current * (r_new / r_current)^(3/2)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nr_new / r_current = 2 / 6.6 ≈ 0.3030\n\n(0.3030)^(3/2) = sqrt(0.3030³) = sqrt(0.0278) ≈ 0.1667\n\nTherefore, T_new ≈ 24 * 0.1667 ≈ 4.0 hours. \n\nYes, so this confirms the previous result. \n\nTherefore, the minimum rotational period is approximately 4 hours, which is option (B). \n\nBut just to make sure that my initial assumption about coverage is correct. If each satellite covers 120 degrees, then with three satellites spaced 120 degrees apart, their coverage areas would just meet at the edges. For example, satellite A covers from 0 to 120 degrees, satellite B covers from 120 to 240 degrees, satellite C covers from 240 to 360 degrees. But in reality, the coverage is symmetric around each satellite. So if each satellite covers an arc of 120 degrees centered on itself, then the coverage would overlap with adjacent satellites. For instance, satellite A covers from -60 to +60 degrees relative to its position (assuming it's at 0 degrees), so from 0 - 60 = -60 (or 300 degrees) to 0 + 60 = 60 degrees. Then satellite B is at 120 degrees, covering from 120 - 60 = 60 degrees to 120 + 60 = 180 degrees. Therefore, there's overlap between satellite A and B from 60 degrees. Similarly between others. Therefore, the entire equator is covered with overlaps. Therefore, if the coverage arc is 120 degrees (i.e., θ = 60 degrees), then three satellites suffice. \n\nTherefore, my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is (B) 4 h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
