Hmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with square roots, the first step is usually to get rid of the square root by squaring both sides of the equation. That should help me solve for x. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting with √(3x - 5) = 2. If I square both sides, that would be (√(3x - 5))² = 2². Simplifying both sides, the square and the square root cancel each other out on the left side, so I get 3x - 5 = 4. \n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let me add 5 to both sides to isolate the term with x. Adding 5 to both sides: 3x - 5 + 5 = 4 + 5. That simplifies to 3x = 9. \n\nNext, I should divide both sides by 3 to solve for x. Dividing both sides by 3: 3x/3 = 9/3. Which simplifies to x = 3. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this solution is valid because sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, you might introduce extraneous solutions. Let me check by plugging x = 3 back into the original equation. \n\nOriginal equation: √(3x - 5) = 2. Substitute x = 3: √(3*3 - 5) = √(9 - 5) = √4. The square root of 4 is 2, which matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 3 is a valid solution. \n\nIs there any other possible value for x? Let me think. Since the square root function only gives the principal (non-negative) root, the left side of the equation √(3x - 5) is always non-negative. The right side is 2, which is also positive. Therefore, there shouldn't be any other solutions. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider the domain of the original equation. The expression under the square root, 3x - 5, must be greater than or equal to 0. So, 3x - 5 ≥ 0. Solving for x, add 5 to both sides: 3x ≥ 5. Then divide by 3: x ≥ 5/3 ≈ 1.666... \n\nOur solution x = 3 is indeed greater than 5/3, so it's within the domain. Since squaring both sides only gave us one solution and it's within the domain, there are no other solutions. \n\nWait, but what if there was a negative solution? Let me see. Suppose someone thought that √(3x - 5) could also equal -2. But the square root symbol denotes the principal root, which is non-negative. So, √(anything) is always ≥ 0. Therefore, the equation √(3x - 5) = 2 can't have a negative solution because the left side is non-negative. \n\nTherefore, x = 3 is the only solution. \n\nLet me recap the steps:\n\n1. Start with √(3x - 5) = 2.\n2. Square both sides: 3x - 5 = 4.\n3. Solve for x: 3x = 9 ⇒ x = 3.\n4. Check the solution in the original equation: √(3*3 - 5) = √4 = 2 ✔️.\n5. Confirm that x = 3 is in the domain (x ≥ 5/3) ✔️.\n6. Conclude that there are no extraneous solutions or other possible solutions.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of x is 3. \n\nI think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key steps were squaring both sides, solving the linear equation, checking the solution in the original equation, and verifying the domain. All steps check out. \n\nAnother way to think about it: The function f(x) = √(3x - 5) is a square root function that starts at x = 5/3 and increases from there. The equation f(x) = 2 is a horizontal line intersecting this square root graph at exactly one point, which is x = 3. Since square root functions are one-to-one, there's only one intersection point. \n\nYep, that makes sense. So, no other solutions exist. Definitely x = 3 is the only answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe possible value of $ x $ is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>"}
