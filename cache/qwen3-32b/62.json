The given information includes the angle between their directions of travel (60 degrees), their momenta (450 MeV and 135 MeV respectively), and their rest masses (938.3 MeV for the proton and 139.6 MeV for the pion). Since the problem mentions assuming c=1, I think that means I can treat energy and momentum in units where the speed of light is 1, simplifying some equations. \n\nFirst, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays into two others, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. The neutral particle is at rest before decaying, right? Wait, actually, the problem doesn't say that. Hmm. Wait, if the problem gives the angle between the proton and pion, and their momenta, it's possible that the neutral particle was moving? Or maybe not? Wait, but if the neutral particle was moving, then the decay products would have some relation to the original momentum. But since we are given the angle between the proton and pion, maybe we need to use conservation of momentum in the lab frame where the neutral particle is moving? Or maybe it's in the rest frame of the neutral particle? Wait, but if the neutral particle is at rest, then the decay products should have equal and opposite momenta, so the angle between them would be 180 degrees. But here the angle is 60 degrees, so that suggests that the neutral particle is not at rest in the lab frame. Therefore, we must be in a frame where the neutral particle is moving, and when it decays, the two particles go off at some angle. \n\nBut how do we find the mass of the neutral particle? The mass would be the sum of the energies of the decay products minus the kinetic energy? No, wait, the mass of the neutral particle should be equal to the total energy of the decay products in the rest frame of the neutral particle. But since we are in a different frame (lab frame?), we need to calculate the invariant mass of the proton and pion system, which should be equal to the mass of the neutral particle. \n\nYes, that's right. The invariant mass of the system is given by the square root of (E_total² - |p_total|²), where E_total is the total energy of the proton and pion, and p_total is the total momentum vector. Since invariant mass is frame-independent, this should give us the mass of the original neutral particle. \n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Calculate the energy of the proton and the energy of the pion using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = p² + m². Since c=1, the formula simplifies to E² = p² + m².\n\n2. Find the total energy E_total = E_p + E_π.\n\n3. Find the total momentum vector. Since the proton and pion are moving at an angle θ=60° relative to each other, I need to compute the vector sum of their momenta. \n\nLet me visualize this. Let's assume that the proton is moving along the x-axis, and the pion is moving at an angle of 60° relative to the proton. Wait, but the angle between their directions is 60°, so if the proton is along the x-axis, the pion would be at 60° from the x-axis. However, depending on the frame, their momenta might not be in opposite directions. \n\nBut since the neutral particle is moving in this frame, the momenta of the decay products won't necessarily be opposite. However, in the rest frame of the neutral particle, their momenta would be opposite. But here, we are in a different frame. \n\nBut regardless, to compute the invariant mass, I need the total energy and total momentum. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute E_p and E_π.\n\nFor the proton:\n\nE_p² = p_p² + m_p² = (450)^2 + (938.3)^2 MeV².\n\nSimilarly, for the pion:\n\nE_π² = p_π² + m_π² = (135)^2 + (139.6)^2 MeV².\n\nLet me calculate these values.\n\nStarting with E_p:\n\nFirst, compute 450^2. 450 squared is 202,500 MeV².\n\nThen 938.3 squared. Let me compute that. Well, 900² is 810,000, 38.3² is approx 1,466.89, and cross term 2*900*38.3 = 68,940. So total approx 810,000 + 68,940 + 1,466.89 ≈ 880,406.89 MeV². But let me check with calculator steps.\n\nAlternatively, since exact numbers are given, maybe I need to calculate them more precisely. Wait, but maybe I can just keep them as numbers for now. Alternatively, maybe I can use exact values. Let me do that.\n\nBut perhaps I can just calculate E_p and E_π numerically.\n\nFirst, E_p:\n\nE_p = sqrt(450² + 938.3²) MeV.\n\nCompute 450²: 450*450. 400²=160,000, 50²=2,500, 2*400*50=40,000. So total 160,000 + 40,000 + 2,500 = 202,500 MeV². Correct.\n\nNow 938.3². Let me compute this:\n\nFirst, 938.3^2. Let me note that 938^2 = (900 + 38)^2 = 900² + 2*900*38 + 38² = 810,000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 810,000 + 68,400 is 878,400 + 1,444 is 879,844 MeV². Then, since it's 938.3, which is 938 + 0.3. So:\n\n(938 + 0.3)^2 = 938² + 2*938*0.3 + 0.3² = 879,844 + 562.8 + 0.09 ≈ 879,844 + 562.89 = 880,406.89 MeV².\n\nSo E_p² ≈ 202,500 + 880,406.89 ≈ 1,082,906.89 MeV². Therefore, E_p ≈ sqrt(1,082,906.89) MeV.\n\nCalculating sqrt(1,082,906.89). Let me see. Well, 1000² is 1,000,000. 1040² is 1,081,600. Because 1000² + 2*1000*40 + 40² = 1,000,000 + 80,000 + 1,600 = 1,081,600. Then 1040² is 1,081,600. Our value is 1,082,906.89. So difference is 1,082,906.89 - 1,081,600 = 1,306.89. \n\nSo sqrt(1,082,906.89) ≈ 1040 + 1,306.89/(2*1040) ≈ 1040 + 1,306.89 / 2080 ≈ 1040 + 0.628 ≈ 1040.628 MeV. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\nLet me compute 1040.628²:\n\n(1040 + 0.628)^2 = 1040² + 2*1040*0.628 + 0.628² ≈ 1,081,600 + 1,307.84 + 0.394 ≈ 1,081,600 + 1,308.23 ≈ 1,082,908.23 MeV². Which is very close to our target of 1,082,906.89. So E_p ≈ 1040.628 MeV. Let me take it as approximately 1040.63 MeV.\n\nSimilarly, for the pion:\n\nE_π = sqrt(135² + 139.6²) MeV.\n\nCompute 135²: 18,225 MeV².\n\n139.6²: Let's compute that. 140² = 19,600. So 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. Therefore, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19,600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19,488.16 MeV².\n\nTherefore, E_π² = 18,225 + 19,488.16 = 37,713.16 MeV².\n\nTaking square root: sqrt(37,713.16). Let me see. 194² is 37,636. 195² is 38,025. Our value is 37,713.16. So between 194 and 195. Let me compute 194.2² = (194 + 0.2)^2 = 194² + 2*194*0.2 + 0.2² = 37,636 + 77.6 + 0.04 = 37,713.64 MeV². Wow, that's very close to our value of 37,713.16. So E_π ≈ 194.2 MeV. Since 194.2² is 37,713.64, which is 0.48 MeV² higher than our target. So maybe subtract a tiny bit. Let me approximate E_π ≈ 194.2 - (0.48)/(2*194.2) ≈ 194.2 - 0.48/388.4 ≈ 194.2 - 0.0012 ≈ 194.1988 MeV. So approximately 194.2 MeV. For simplicity, I can take E_π ≈ 194.2 MeV.\n\nSo now, total energy E_total = E_p + E_π ≈ 1040.63 + 194.2 ≈ 1234.83 MeV.\n\nNext, need to compute the total momentum vector. The total momentum is the vector sum of the proton momentum and the pion momentum. Since they are at an angle θ=60°, the magnitude of the total momentum can be found using the law of cosines:\n\n|p_total|² = |p_p|² + |p_π|² + 2 |p_p| |p_π| cos(θ)\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the angle between the two momentum vectors is 60°, so when adding vectors, the formula is:\n\n|p_total|² = p_p² + p_π² + 2 p_p p_π cos(theta)\n\nBut wait, theta is the angle between them. If they are going in directions with angle 60° between them, then yes. So substituting:\n\np_p = 450 MeV, p_π = 135 MeV, theta=60°.\n\nTherefore:\n\n|p_total|² = (450)^2 + (135)^2 + 2*(450)*(135)*cos(60°)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, 450² is 202,500.\n\nSecond, 135² is 18,225.\n\nThird, 2*450*135*cos(60°). Since cos(60°)=0.5, so 2*450*135*0.5 = 450*135.\n\nCalculate 450*135. Let's compute 450*100=45,000; 450*35=15,750. Total is 45,000 + 15,750 = 60,750.\n\nTherefore, |p_total|² = 202,500 + 18,225 + 60,750 = Let's add them up:\n\n202,500 + 18,225 = 220,725; 220,725 + 60,750 = 281,475 MeV².\n\nTherefore, |p_total| = sqrt(281,475) MeV.\n\nCalculating sqrt(281,475). Let me see. 500²=250,000; 530²=280,900; 531²=281,961. Our target is 281,475. So between 530 and 531.\n\nCompute 530² = 280,900. Difference is 281,475 - 280,900 = 575. So approximate sqrt ≈ 530 + 575/(2*530) ≈ 530 + 575/1060 ≈ 530 + 0.542 ≈ 530.542 MeV. Let me check 530.54² ≈ ?\n\n(530 + 0.54)^2 = 530² + 2*530*0.54 + 0.54² ≈ 280,900 + 572.4 + 0.29 ≈ 280,900 + 572.69 ≈ 281,472.69 MeV². Which is very close to 281,475. So |p_total| ≈ 530.54 MeV. Let me take it as approximately 530.54 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the invariant mass squared is:\n\nM² = E_total² - |p_total|² ≈ (1234.83)^2 - (530.54)^2.\n\nCompute these squares.\n\nFirst, 1234.83². Let me approximate. Let me note that 1200² = 1,440,000. 1234.83 is 1200 + 34.83. So:\n\n(1200 + 34.83)^2 = 1200² + 2*1200*34.83 + 34.83².\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1200² = 1,440,000.\n\n2*1200*34.83 = 2400*34.83. Let me compute 2400*30 = 72,000; 2400*4.83 = 2400*4 + 2400*0.83 = 9,600 + 1,992 = 11,592. Total is 72,000 + 11,592 = 83,592.\n\nThird term: 34.83² ≈ (35 - 0.17)^2 ≈ 35² - 2*35*0.17 + 0.17² ≈ 1,225 - 11.9 + 0.0289 ≈ 1,213.1289.\n\nTherefore, total E_total² ≈ 1,440,000 + 83,592 + 1,213.13 ≈ 1,440,000 + 83,592 = 1,523,592 + 1,213.13 ≈ 1,524,805.13 MeV².\n\nNow compute |p_total|² = (530.54)^2 ≈ 281,475 MeV² (as calculated earlier). Therefore:\n\nM² ≈ 1,524,805.13 - 281,475 ≈ 1,243,330.13 MeV².\n\nTherefore, M ≈ sqrt(1,243,330.13) MeV.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1,243,330.13). Let me note that 1,100² = 1,210,000. 1,120² = 1,254,400. Our target is 1,243,330. So between 1,120 and 1,100? Wait, 1,100² is 1,210,000. 1,110² = (1,100 + 10)^2 = 1,210,000 + 22,000 + 100 = 1,232,100. Still less than 1,243,330. 1,120² is 1,254,400. So between 1,110 and 1,120.\n\nCompute difference between 1,243,330 and 1,232,100 (which is 1,110²): 1,243,330 - 1,232,100 = 11,230.\n\nNow, let me approximate. Let me take x = 1,110 + Δx, such that (1,110 + Δx)^2 = 1,243,330.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(1,110)^2 + 2*1,110*Δx + (Δx)^2 = 1,232,100 + 2,220 Δx + Δx² = 1,243,330.\n\nAssuming Δx is small, Δx² is negligible. Then:\n\n2,220 Δx ≈ 11,230 => Δx ≈ 11,230 / 2,220 ≈ 5.058.\n\nSo approximate sqrt ≈ 1,110 + 5.058 ≈ 1,115.058 MeV. Let me check 1,115²:\n\n(1,115)^2 = (1,100 + 15)^2 = 1,210,000 + 2*1,100*15 + 15² = 1,210,000 + 33,000 + 225 = 1,243,225 MeV².\n\nWow, very close to our target of 1,243,330. The difference is 1,243,330 - 1,243,225 = 105 MeV². So to get a better approximation, let's consider:\n\nLet me write M ≈ 1,115 + Δ, where Δ is small. Then:\n\n(1,115 + Δ)^2 = 1,115² + 2*1,115*Δ + Δ² ≈ 1,243,225 + 2,230 Δ ≈ 1,243,330.\n\nTherefore, 2,230 Δ ≈ 105 => Δ ≈ 105 / 2,230 ≈ 0.047. So M ≈ 1,115.047 MeV. Therefore, approximately 1,115.05 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the mass of the neutral particle is approximately 1,115 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if my calculations for E_total and |p_total| were precise enough. Let me verify the numbers again.\n\nFirst, E_p was approximated as 1040.63 MeV. Let me check with more precise calculation. Earlier, we had E_p² ≈ 1,082,906.89 MeV². Let me compute sqrt(1,082,906.89) more accurately.\n\nAs I approximated earlier, 1040.628² ≈ 1,082,908.23, which is slightly higher than 1,082,906.89. Therefore, the exact value is a bit less than 1040.628. Let me compute the difference: 1,082,908.23 - 1,082,906.89 = 1.34 MeV². So to adjust the value, since the square is 1.34 MeV² higher, we can approximate the correction. Let me denote x = 1040.628 - δ, such that x² = 1,082,906.89.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(1040.628 - δ)^2 ≈ 1040.628² - 2*1040.628*δ ≈ 1,082,908.23 - 2081.256 δ = 1,082,906.89.\n\nTherefore, 2081.256 δ ≈ 1,082,908.23 - 1,082,906.89 = 1.34 => δ ≈ 1.34 / 2081.256 ≈ 0.000644. Therefore, E_p ≈ 1040.628 - 0.000644 ≈ 1040.627 MeV. So negligible difference. Therefore, my previous value of E_p ≈ 1040.63 MeV is accurate enough.\n\nSimilarly, E_π was approximated as 194.2 MeV. Earlier calculation showed that 194.2² ≈ 37,713.64 MeV², while E_π² was 37,713.16 MeV². So difference is 37,713.64 - 37,713.16 = 0.48 MeV². Therefore, similar to before, adjusting δ:\n\nLet me write x = 194.2 - δ, so that x² ≈ 37,713.16. Then:\n\n(194.2 - δ)^2 ≈ 194.2² - 2*194.2 δ ≈ 37,713.64 - 388.4 δ = 37,713.16 => 388.4 δ ≈ 0.48 => δ ≈ 0.48 / 388.4 ≈ 0.001236. Therefore, E_π ≈ 194.2 - 0.0012 ≈ 194.1988 MeV. Again, negligible difference. Therefore, E_total is approximately 1040.63 + 194.1988 ≈ 1234.8288 MeV. Which I had approximated as 1234.83 MeV, so that's accurate.\n\nFor |p_total|, we had approximated 530.54 MeV. Earlier, we saw that 530.54² ≈ 281,475 MeV², which was our |p_total|². So that is accurate.\n\nThen, E_total² was approximated as 1,524,805.13 MeV². Let me check with more precise numbers. If E_total is 1234.8288 MeV, then:\n\nE_total² = (1234.8288)^2. Let me use a better approach. Since we had earlier calculated using the expansion around 1200 + 34.83, but perhaps I should check with more accurate numbers. However, given that the approximation was already very close to the actual value (since 1,115² was 1,243,225 and our M² was 1,243,330), which is only about 105 MeV² difference, leading to a mass of about 1,115.05 MeV. \n\nBut let me check with more precise calculation of E_total² - |p_total|².\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use more precise numbers for E_p and E_π.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can carry out the calculation symbolically first, then plug in numbers. Let me try that.\n\nThe invariant mass squared is:\n\nM² = (E_p + E_π)² - |p_total|².\n\nExpanding (E_p + E_π)²:\n\n= E_p² + 2 E_p E_π + E_π² - |p_total|².\n\nBut note that E_p² = p_p² + m_p² and E_π² = p_π² + m_π². Therefore:\n\nM² = (p_p² + m_p²) + 2 E_p E_π + (p_π² + m_π²) - |p_total|².\n\nBut also, |p_total|² = p_p² + p_π² + 2 p_p p_π cos(theta). Therefore:\n\nM² = p_p² + m_p² + 2 E_p E_π + p_π² + m_π² - p_p² - p_π² - 2 p_p p_π cos(theta)\n\nSimplify:\n\nM² = m_p² + m_π² + 2 E_p E_π - 2 p_p p_π cos(theta)\n\nTherefore:\n\nM² = m_p² + m_π² + 2 [E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)]\n\nThis formula might be easier to compute with precise numbers.\n\nSo let me compute this expression:\n\nFirst, m_p² = (938.3)^2 ≈ 880,406.89 MeV².\n\nm_π² = (139.6)^2 ≈ 19,488.16 MeV².\n\nThen, 2 [E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)].\n\nWe need E_p ≈ 1040.63 MeV, E_π ≈ 194.2 MeV.\n\np_p = 450 MeV, p_π = 135 MeV, cos(theta) = cos(60°) = 0.5.\n\nCompute E_p E_π ≈ 1040.63 * 194.2 ≈ Let me calculate this.\n\nFirst, approximate 1040 * 194.2 = ?\n\nWell, 1000*194.2 = 194,200; 40*194.2 = 7,768. Total ≈ 194,200 + 7,768 = 201,968.\n\nThen, 0.63*194.2 ≈ 122.346. So total E_p E_π ≈ 201,968 + 122.346 ≈ 202,090.346 MeV².\n\nThen p_p p_π cos(theta) = 450 * 135 * 0.5 = 450 * 67.5 = 30,375 MeV².\n\nTherefore, 2 [E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)] ≈ 2 [202,090.346 - 30,375] = 2 [171,715.346] ≈ 343,430.692 MeV².\n\nThen adding m_p² + m_π²:\n\n880,406.89 + 19,488.16 ≈ 899,895.05 MeV².\n\nTherefore, total M² ≈ 899,895.05 + 343,430.692 ≈ 1,243,325.74 MeV².\n\nWhich is very close to my previous result of ≈1,243,330.13 MeV². The slight difference is due to rounding errors in intermediate steps. Therefore, taking M² ≈ 1,243,325.74 MeV².\n\nTherefore, M ≈ sqrt(1,243,325.74) MeV.\n\nAs we saw earlier, 1,115² = 1,243,225. Therefore, 1,243,325.74 - 1,243,225 = 100.74 MeV². So again, similar to before. Therefore, delta ≈ 100.74 / (2*1,115) ≈ 100.74 / 2,230 ≈ 0.04517. Therefore, M ≈ 1,115 + 0.045 ≈ 1,115.045 MeV. Therefore, approximately 1,115.05 MeV.\n\nSo rounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, perhaps 1,115 MeV. However, given that the rest masses are given to one decimal place (m_p = 938.3 MeV, m_π = 139.6 MeV), and momenta to three significant figures (p_p = 450 MeV, p_π = 135 MeV), maybe we need to check if there is a more precise value or if there is a standard particle with this mass.\n\nWait, 1,115 MeV is approximately the mass of a K meson? No, K mesons are around 494 MeV (K±) or 498 MeV (K0). The Sigma baryons are around 1190 MeV. The Lambda baryon is about 1116 MeV. Wait, Lambda (Λ) baryon has a mass of approximately 1115.683 MeV/c². Which is very close to our calculated value of ~1115 MeV. Therefore, this suggests that the neutral particle is a Lambda baryon (Λ⁰), which decays into a proton and a pion. Indeed, the Λ⁰ decays into p + π⁻ (among other decay modes). \n\nGiven that the calculated mass is approximately 1115.6 MeV, which matches the known mass of the Lambda baryon, which is about 1115.683 MeV/c². Given that our calculation resulted in approximately 1115.05 MeV, which is very close, considering rounding errors in the calculation steps. Therefore, the answer is approximately 1115.7 MeV, but since we need to calculate it precisely based on given numbers, let me check if with more precise numbers we can get a better value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should carry out the calculation with more precise intermediate steps.\n\nLet me redo the calculation for M² using more precise values.\n\nFirst, compute E_p and E_π with higher precision.\n\nFor E_p:\n\nE_p² = 450² + 938.3² = 202,500 + 880,406.89 = 1,082,906.89 MeV².\n\nE_p = sqrt(1,082,906.89). Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me note that 1040.6² = ?\n\nWell, 1040^2 = 1,081,600. 1040.6^2 = (1040 + 0.6)^2 = 1040² + 2*1040*0.6 + 0.6² = 1,081,600 + 1,248 + 0.36 = 1,082,848.36 MeV².\n\nOur target is 1,082,906.89. The difference is 1,082,906.89 - 1,082,848.36 = 58.53 MeV².\n\nNow, let me take x = 1040.6 + δ, such that (1040.6 + δ)^2 ≈ 1,082,906.89.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(1040.6)^2 + 2*1040.6*δ + δ² ≈ 1,082,848.36 + 2,081.2 δ + δ² = 1,082,906.89.\n\nAssuming δ is small, δ² is negligible. Therefore:\n\n2,081.2 δ ≈ 58.53 => δ ≈ 58.53 / 2,081.2 ≈ 0.0281. Therefore, E_p ≈ 1040.6 + 0.0281 ≈ 1040.6281 MeV. Therefore, E_p ≈ 1040.628 MeV.\n\nSimilarly for E_π:\n\nE_π² = 135² + 139.6² = 18,225 + 19,488.16 = 37,713.16 MeV².\n\nEarlier, we saw that 194.2² = 37,713.64, which is 0.48 MeV² higher. So let me calculate E_π with more precision. Let me take x = 194.2 - δ, where δ ≈ 0.48 / (2*194.2) ≈ 0.48 / 388.4 ≈ 0.001236. Therefore, E_π ≈ 194.2 - 0.001236 ≈ 194.1988 MeV.\n\nNow, compute E_p * E_π:\n\nE_p ≈ 1040.628 MeV\n\nE_π ≈ 194.1988 MeV\n\nMultiplying these:\n\nFirst, compute 1040 * 194.1988 = ?\n\nWell, 1000*194.1988 = 194,198.8\n\n40*194.1988 = 7,767.952\n\nTotal = 194,198.8 + 7,767.952 = 201,966.752 MeV².\n\nNow, the remaining part is 0.628 * 194.1988 ≈ Let's compute:\n\n0.6 * 194.1988 = 116.5193\n\n0.028 * 194.1988 ≈ 5.4376\n\nTotal ≈ 116.5193 + 5.4376 ≈ 121.9569 MeV².\n\nTherefore, total E_p * E_π ≈ 201,966.752 + 121.9569 ≈ 202,088.7089 MeV².\n\nThen, p_p p_π cos(theta) = 450 * 135 * 0.5 = 450 * 67.5 = 30,375 MeV².\n\nTherefore, the term [E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)] ≈ 202,088.7089 - 30,375 ≈ 171,713.7089 MeV².\n\nMultiply by 2: 2 * 171,713.7089 ≈ 343,427.4178 MeV².\n\nNow add m_p² + m_π²:\n\nm_p² = 938.3² = 880,406.89 MeV².\n\nm_π² = 139.6² = 19,488.16 MeV².\n\nTotal m_p² + m_π² = 880,406.89 + 19,488.16 = 899,895.05 MeV².\n\nTherefore, total M² = 899,895.05 + 343,427.4178 ≈ 1,243,322.47 MeV².\n\nTherefore, M = sqrt(1,243,322.47) MeV.\n\nAs before, 1,115² = 1,243,225. The difference is 1,243,322.47 - 1,243,225 = 97.47 MeV².\n\nTherefore, delta ≈ 97.47 / (2*1,115) ≈ 97.47 / 2,230 ≈ 0.0437 MeV.\n\nTherefore, M ≈ 1,115 + 0.0437 ≈ 1,115.0437 MeV ≈ 1,115.04 MeV.\n\nSo, approximately 1,115.04 MeV. Given that the known mass of the Λ⁰ is about 1,115.68 MeV, there is a slight discrepancy here. However, this might be due to rounding errors in the given data or in the calculation steps. Let me check if perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the exact value of m_p and m_π. The problem states:\n\nm_p = 938.3 MeV\n\nm_π = 139.6 MeV\n\nBut the actual rest mass of the proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the pion is about 139.57 MeV/c². The given values are rounded to one decimal place, which is fine.\n\nThe given momenta are p_p = 450 MeV and p_π = 135 MeV. These are presumably given with three significant figures.\n\nThe angle is given as 60 degrees, which is exact.\n\nLet me check my calculation of M² once again:\n\nM² = m_p² + m_π² + 2(E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)).\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\nm_p² = 938.3² = let me compute it more accurately.\n\n938.3 squared:\n\nLet me use the formula (a + b)^2 where a = 938, b = 0.3.\n\n(938 + 0.3)^2 = 938² + 2*938*0.3 + 0.3².\n\nCompute 938²:\n\nWell, 900² + 2*900*38 + 38² = 810,000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 879,844 MeV².\n\nThen 2*938*0.3 = 2*938*0.3 = 562.8 MeV².\n\n0.3² = 0.09 MeV².\n\nTherefore, total m_p² = 879,844 + 562.8 + 0.09 = 880,406.89 MeV². Correct.\n\nSimilarly, m_π² = 139.6²:\n\n(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19,600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19,488.16 MeV². Correct.\n\nThen E_p E_π ≈ 202,088.7089 MeV² (from previous calculation). \n\np_p p_π cos(theta) = 450 * 135 * 0.5 = 30,375 MeV². Correct.\n\nSo 2*(E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)) ≈ 2*(202,088.7089 - 30,375) ≈ 2*(171,713.7089) ≈ 343,427.4178 MeV². Correct.\n\nAdding m_p² + m_π² = 880,406.89 + 19,488.16 = 899,895.05 MeV². Correct.\n\nTotal M² ≈ 899,895.05 + 343,427.4178 ≈ 1,243,322.47 MeV². Correct.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1,243,322.47) ≈ 1,115.04 MeV. Given that the known value is about 1,115.68 MeV, there is a difference of approximately 0.64 MeV. This could be due to rounding during the calculation steps. Let me check if perhaps more precise calculation of E_p and E_π would help.\n\nLet me recalculate E_p and E_π with higher precision.\n\nStarting with E_p:\n\nE_p = sqrt(450² + 938.3²) = sqrt(202,500 + 880,406.89) = sqrt(1,082,906.89). \n\nLet me use the Newton-Raphson method to compute this square root more accurately. Let me take an initial guess of 1040.628 MeV, as before. Let me compute f(x) = x² - 1,082,906.89.\n\nf(1040.628) = (1040.628)^2 - 1,082,906.89. Earlier, we approximated this as approximately 0. However, let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 1040.628^2:\n\nBreak it down as (1040 + 0.628)^2 = 1040² + 2*1040*0.628 + 0.628².\n\nWe know 1040² = 1,081,600.\n\n2*1040*0.628 = 2080 * 0.628. Let me compute 2000*0.628 = 1,256 and 80*0.628 = 50.24, so total 1,256 + 50.24 = 1,306.24.\n\n0.628² = 0.394384.\n\nTherefore, total is 1,081,600 + 1,306.24 + 0.394384 ≈ 1,082,906.634 MeV².\n\nCompare to target 1,082,906.89 MeV². The difference is 1,082,906.89 - 1,082,906.634 ≈ 0.256 MeV². Therefore, f(x) ≈ 0.256. To find a better approximation, use Newton-Raphson:\n\nx_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/(2x_n)\n\nSo x_{n+1} = 1040.628 - 0.256 / (2*1040.628) ≈ 1040.628 - 0.256 / 2081.256 ≈ 1040.628 - 0.000123 ≈ 1040.627877 MeV.\n\nTherefore, E_p ≈ 1040.6279 MeV.\n\nSimilarly, for E_π:\n\nE_π = sqrt(135² + 139.6²) = sqrt(18,225 + 19,488.16) = sqrt(37,713.16).\n\nEarlier, we had approximated this as 194.1988 MeV. Let me apply Newton-Raphson here as well.\n\nLet me take an initial guess of x = 194.1988 MeV.\n\nCompute f(x) = x² - 37,713.16.\n\nx = 194.1988:\n\nx² = (194.2 - 0.0012)^2 = 194.2² - 2*194.2*0.0012 + (0.0012)^2 ≈ 37,713.64 - 0.46608 + 0.00000144 ≈ 37,713.174 MeV².\n\nCompare to target 37,713.16. Therefore, f(x) ≈ 37,713.174 - 37,713.16 = 0.014 MeV².\n\nApply Newton-Raphson:\n\nx_{n+1} = x - f(x)/(2x) ≈ 194.1988 - 0.014 / (2*194.1988) ≈ 194.1988 - 0.014 / 388.3976 ≈ 194.1988 - 0.000036 ≈ 194.19876 MeV.\n\nTherefore, E_π ≈ 194.19876 MeV.\n\nNow, recalculate E_p * E_π with more precise numbers:\n\nE_p ≈ 1040.6279 MeV\n\nE_π ≈ 194.19876 MeV\n\nMultiplying them:\n\nLet me use the more accurate value of E_p * E_π ≈ 202,088.7089 MeV² as before, since the adjustments are minuscule and won't significantly change the product. Therefore, proceeding with that value.\n\nThus, the term [E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)] ≈ 202,088.7089 - 30,375 ≈ 171,713.7089 MeV².\n\nMultiply by 2: 343,427.4178 MeV².\n\nAdding m_p² + m_π² = 899,895.05 MeV².\n\nTotal M² ≈ 1,243,322.47 MeV².\n\nTherefore, M ≈ sqrt(1,243,322.47) ≈ 1,115.04 MeV.\n\nGiven that the known mass of the Λ⁰ is approximately 1,115.68 MeV, there's a small discrepancy. However, considering that the given values in the problem are rounded (e.g., m_p = 938.3 MeV instead of 938.272 MeV, m_π = 139.6 MeV instead of 139.57 MeV), and the momenta are given as 450 and 135 MeV, which might be rounded, this difference is acceptable. Therefore, the calculated mass is approximately 1,115 MeV.\n\nHowever, to present the answer accurately based on the given numbers, let me carry out the calculation with all precise steps using the exact numbers provided in the problem.\n\nGiven:\n\nm_p = 938.3 MeV\n\nm_π = 139.6 MeV\n\np_p = 450 MeV\n\np_π = 135 MeV\n\nθ = 60°\n\nLet me recompute E_p and E_π with exact values:\n\nE_p = sqrt(450² + 938.3²) = sqrt(202500 + 880406.89) = sqrt(1,082,906.89) ≈ 1040.6279 MeV\n\nE_π = sqrt(135² + 139.6²) = sqrt(18225 + 19488.16) = sqrt(37713.16) ≈ 194.1988 MeV\n\nNow, compute E_p * E_π:\n\n1040.6279 * 194.1988 ≈ Let me use more precise multiplication.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLet me approximate 1040.6279 * 194.1988.\n\nFirst, note that 1040.6279 * 194.1988 ≈ (1000 + 40.6279) * 194.1988\n\n= 1000*194.1988 + 40.6279*194.1988\n\n= 194,198.8 + (40 * 194.1988 + 0.6279 * 194.1988)\n\nCalculate 40 * 194.1988 = 7,767.952\n\nCalculate 0.6279 * 194.1988 ≈ Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 0.6 * 194.1988 = 116.5193\n\n0.0279 * 194.1988 ≈ 5.417 MeV\n\nTotal ≈ 116.5193 + 5.417 ≈ 121.9363 MeV\n\nTherefore, total E_p * E_π ≈ 194,198.8 + 7,767.952 + 121.9363 ≈ 194,198.8 + 7,889.8883 ≈ 202,088.6883 MeV².\n\nTherefore, [E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)] ≈ 202,088.6883 - 30,375 ≈ 171,713.6883 MeV².\n\nMultiply by 2: 343,427.3766 MeV².\n\nAdding m_p² + m_π² = 880,406.89 + 19,488.16 = 899,895.05 MeV².\n\nTotal M² ≈ 899,895.05 + 343,427.3766 ≈ 1,243,322.4266 MeV².\n\nTherefore, M ≈ sqrt(1,243,322.4266) ≈ 1,115.04 MeV.\n\nGiven that the problem provides all values to three significant figures (except the angle, which is exact), the answer should be presented with appropriate precision. However, since the given momenta are three significant figures (450 and 135 MeV) and the masses are given to one decimal place (which is more than three significant figures), the precision of the result is mainly limited by the momenta. Therefore, the mass should be reported to three significant figures. However, 1,115.04 MeV is already four significant figures. Given that the calculated value is approximately 1,115.0 MeV, and considering possible rounding, it's likely that the precise answer based on the given numbers is 1,115 MeV.\n\nHowever, to ensure correctness, let me check if there is any miscalculation. Let me verify the formula again:\n\nM² = m_p² + m_π² + 2(E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)).\n\nYes, this is correct because:\n\n(E_p + E_π)^2 - |p_total|² = E_p² + 2 E_p E_π + E_π² - (p_p² + p_π² + 2 p_p p_π cos(theta)) = m_p² + m_π² + 2 E_p E_π - 2 p_p p_π cos(theta).\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. Given the inputs, the mass is approximately 1,115 MeV. Given that the known Λ⁰ mass is about 1,115.68 MeV, this is very close, and the difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 1,115 MeV. However, to present it accurately based on the given numbers, let me check if the exact calculation with the given numbers gives exactly 1,115 MeV or something slightly different.\n\nGiven that M² is approximately 1,243,322.43 MeV², let me compute sqrt(1,243,322.43):\n\nAs established, 1,115² = 1,243,225.\n\nCompute 1,115.04²:\n\n= (1,115 + 0.04)^2 = 1,115² + 2*1,115*0.04 + 0.04² = 1,243,225 + 89.2 + 0.0016 = 1,243,314.2016 MeV².\n\nCompare to our M² of 1,243,322.43 MeV². The difference is 1,243,322.43 - 1,243,314.2016 ≈ 8.2284 MeV².\n\nTherefore, we need to find x such that x² = 1,243,322.43, where x = 1,115.04 + δ.\n\nUsing linear approximation:\n\nx ≈ 1,115.04 + (8.2284) / (2*1,115.04) ≈ 1,115.04 + 8.2284 / 2,230.08 ≈ 1,115.04 + 0.00369 ≈ 1,115.0437 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the precise value is approximately 1,115.04 MeV. Depending on rounding conventions, this could be presented as 1,115 MeV (three significant figures) or 1,115.0 MeV (four significant figures). However, since the given momenta are three significant figures (450 and 135), and the rest masses are given with more precision, it's appropriate to present the answer with three significant figures. However, 1,115.04 MeV is 1.11504 × 10³ MeV, which is five significant figures. Wait, but the given momenta are three significant figures. Let me check:\n\nThe given values:\n\n- p_p = 450 MeV: three significant figures.\n\n- p_π = 135 MeV: three significant figures.\n\n- m_p = 938.3 MeV: four significant figures.\n\n- m_π = 139.6 MeV: four significant figures.\n\n- θ = 60°: exact value.\n\nTherefore, the precision of the result is limited by the momenta's three significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should be given to three significant figures. \n\nOur calculated value is approximately 1,115.04 MeV, which is 1,115 MeV when rounded to three significant figures? Wait, 1,115.04 has four significant figures. Wait, three significant figures would be 1.12 × 10³ MeV? Wait, no. Wait, 1,115.04 MeV is 1,115 MeV if we consider it as four significant figures. But since the least number of significant figures in the given data is three (from the momenta), we need to round to three significant figures.\n\nWait, but 1,115.04 MeV is approximately 1,115 MeV, which is four digits. If we need three significant figures, it would be 1.12 × 10³ MeV? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nThe value is approximately 1,115 MeV. Let me write it in scientific notation:\n\n1,115 MeV = 1.115 × 10³ MeV. If we need three significant figures, it would be 1.12 × 10³ MeV (if the fourth digit is 5 or more), but here the exact value is approximately 1.115 × 10³ MeV. However, since the fourth digit is 5, depending on rounding rules, it might round up. Wait, but the exact value is approximately 1.11504 × 10³ MeV. If we are to round to three significant figures, it would be 1.12 × 10³ MeV, since the fourth digit is 5 (from 1.115...). Wait, but standard rounding rules: if the digit after the last significant figure is 5 or more, round up. So if we have 1.115... and want three significant figures, the third digit is 1 (in 1.11), and the next digit is 5. Therefore, we round up the third digit: 1.12 × 10³ MeV, which is 1,120 MeV. But that seems like a big jump. However, this seems contradictory because our precise calculation is about 1,115 MeV, which is between 1,110 and 1,120. But given that the given data has three significant figures, perhaps we need to consider error propagation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact calculation with the given numbers, regardless of significant figures. Given that the known mass is about 1,115.68 MeV, and our calculation gives approximately 1,115.04 MeV, very close. Given that, and since the problem provides precise numbers, maybe we should present the calculated value with more decimals, or as a whole number.\n\nBut since the problem asks to \"determine the mass of the neutral particle,\" and given that in particle physics, masses are often known to high precision, but here we are to calculate it based on given data. Given that our precise calculation gives approximately 1,115.04 MeV, which rounds to 1,115 MeV when considering three significant figures (if we consider that the input data's precision allows for that). However, since the rest masses are given with more precision, maybe we can keep more decimals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an exact calculation. Let me check if with the given numbers, the exact value is a whole number. For example, if M² is exactly 1,243,322.43 MeV², taking the square root gives approximately 1,115.04 MeV. But maybe there was an exact calculation intended. Let me check if there is an error in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute M² once again with exact numbers:\n\nM² = m_p² + m_π² + 2(E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm_p² = 938.3² = 880,406.89\n\nm_π² = 139.6² = 19,488.16\n\nE_p = sqrt(450² + 938.3²) = sqrt(1,082,906.89) ≈ 1040.6279 MeV\n\nE_π = sqrt(135² + 139.6²) = sqrt(37,713.16) ≈ 194.1988 MeV\n\nE_p * E_π ≈ 1040.6279 * 194.1988 ≈ 202,088.69 MeV²\n\np_p p_π cos(theta) = 450 * 135 * 0.5 = 30,375 MeV²\n\nSo 2*(E_p E_π - p_p p_π cos(theta)) ≈ 2*(202,088.69 - 30,375) = 2*(171,713.69) ≈ 343,427.38 MeV²\n\nAdding m_p² + m_π²: 880,406.89 + 19,488.16 = 899,895.05 MeV²\n\nTotal M² ≈ 899,895.05 + 343,427.38 ≈ 1,243,322.43 MeV²\n\nNow, let me check what is the exact value of sqrt(1,243,322.43). Let me use a calculator for better precision. Since I don't have a calculator here, but I can note that:\n\nAs before, 1,115² = 1,243,225\n\n1,115.1² = (1,115 + 0.1)^2 = 1,115² + 2*1,115*0.1 + 0.1² = 1,243,225 + 223 + 0.01 = 1,243,448.01 MeV²\n\nWait, wait, this can't be. Wait, 1,115.1² should be:\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\n(1,115 + 0.1)^2 = 1,115² + 2*1,115*0.1 + 0.1² = 1,243,225 + 223 + 0.01 = 1,243,448.01 MeV²? Wait, that would mean that between 1,115 and 1,115.1, the square increases by 223 MeV², which is a lot. But our target M² is 1,243,322.43, which is between 1,243,225 (1,115²) and 1,243,448.01 (1,115.1²). Let me find how much between.\n\nThe difference between M² and 1,115² is 1,243,322.43 - 1,243,225 = 97.43 MeV².\n\nThe total range from 1,115 to 1,115.1 is 223 MeV². Therefore, the fraction is 97.43 / 223 ≈ 0.437. Therefore, the value is approximately 1,115 + 0.437*0.1 ≈ 1,115 + 0.0437 ≈ 1,115.0437 MeV, which matches our previous result. Therefore, the precise value is approximately 1,115.04 MeV.\n\nGiven that the problem might expect an exact answer based on the given numbers, and considering that in an exam setting, sometimes you are supposed to calculate it precisely, even if it doesn't match the real-world value exactly, I think the answer expected here is approximately 1,115 MeV. \n\nHowever, let me check if there is a calculation mistake I made. For example, did I use the correct angle? The angle between the two particles is 60 degrees, so when calculating the total momentum, I used the law of cosines with the angle between them, which is correct. Yes, because when adding two vectors with angle θ between them, the magnitude squared is p1² + p2² + 2p1p2cosθ. Yes, that is correct. Therefore, no mistake there.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 1,115 MeV. Given that, and since the problem provides all the necessary data, I think this is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mass of the neutral particle is \\boxed{1115} MeV.\n</think>"}
