The question gives four stars, each with different data, and I have to calculate or derive their equatorial rotational velocities. Let me go through each star step by step.\n\nStarting with Star1. The problem says that the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å is broadened by 0.1 Å due to rotation. I remember that the Doppler broadening of spectral lines can be used to calculate the rotational velocity. The formula for the Doppler broadening is Δλ = (λ * v / c) * sin(i), where Δλ is the broadening, λ is the wavelength, v is the equatorial velocity, c is the speed of light, and i is the inclination angle. The problem says to ignore the inclination, so sin(i) would be 1. Therefore, rearranging the formula to solve for v: v = (Δλ * c) / λ. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nΔλ is 0.1 Å, which is 0.1 × 10^-10 meters (since 1 Å = 10^-10 m). Wait, but the original wavelength is 6300 Å, which is 6300 × 10^-10 m. The speed of light c is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s. So substituting:\n\nv = (0.1 × 10^-10 m * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / (6300 × 10^-10 m)\n\nLet me compute this. The 10^-10 in numerator and denominator will cancel out. So:\n\nv = (0.1 * 3 × 10^8) / 6300 = (3 × 10^7) / 6300 ≈ 4761.9 m/s ≈ 4.76 km/s.\n\nWait, that seems high for a rotational velocity. Let me check the calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in units or exponents.\n\nWait, Δλ is 0.1 Å, λ is 6300 Å. The formula is Δλ = λ * v / c * sin(i). So solving for v:\n\nv = (Δλ * c) / (λ * sin(i)). Since sin(i) is 1, it's v = (0.1 Å / 6300 Å) * c. Which is (0.1 / 6300) * 3 × 10^8 m/s. Let me calculate that:\n\n0.1 / 6300 ≈ 1.5873 × 10^-5. Multiply by 3 × 10^8 m/s:\n\n1.5873 × 10^-5 * 3 × 10^8 ≈ 4.76 × 10^3 m/s ≈ 4.76 km/s. So that's 4.76 km/s. That seems correct. So Star1 has an equatorial velocity of about 4.76 km/s.\n\nNow Star2: it has a rotational period of 20 days. The radius is 1.5 solar radii. To find the equatorial velocity, I can use the formula v = 2πR / P, where R is the radius and P is the period. But I need to convert the period into seconds and the radius into meters.\n\nFirst, the radius of the Sun is approximately 6.96 × 10^8 m. So 1.5 solar radii is 1.5 * 6.96 × 10^8 ≈ 1.044 × 10^9 m.\n\nThe period is 20 days. Converting that to seconds: 20 days * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour = 20 * 24 * 3600 = 1,728,000 seconds ≈ 1.728 × 10^6 seconds.\n\nSo v = 2π * 1.044 × 10^9 m / 1.728 × 10^6 s.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 2π ≈ 6.283. Multiply by 1.044 × 10^9 m: 6.283 * 1.044 × 10^9 ≈ 6.56 × 10^9 m.\n\nDivide by 1.728 × 10^6 s: 6.56 × 10^9 / 1.728 × 10^6 ≈ 3.796 × 10^3 m/s ≈ 3.8 km/s.\n\nSo Star2 has an equatorial velocity of about 3.8 km/s.\n\nStar3: The projected rotational velocity (v sin i) is 3.1 km/s. The inclination is 30 degrees. The projected velocity is v sin i. So to find the actual equatorial velocity v, we need to divide by sin i. Since sin(30°) is 0.5, then v = 3.1 km/s / 0.5 = 6.2 km/s. So Star3 has an equatorial velocity of 6.2 km/s.\n\nStar4: The radial velocity time series shows a 9-day period with an amplitude of 1.5 m/s. The problem says this is due to rotational modulation, not a planet. The rotational period is 9 days. The star has a radius of 1.4 solar radii. Let's calculate the equatorial velocity again using v = 2πR / P.\n\nRadius R = 1.4 * 6.96 × 10^8 m ≈ 9.744 × 10^8 m.\n\nPeriod P = 9 days = 9 * 24 * 3600 = 777,600 seconds ≈ 7.776 × 10^5 s.\n\nv = 2π * 9.744 × 10^8 m / 7.776 × 10^5 s.\n\nCalculating:\n\n2π ≈ 6.283. Multiply by 9.744 × 10^8 m: 6.283 * 9.744 × 10^8 ≈ 6.128 × 10^9 m.\n\nDivide by 7.776 × 10^5 s: 6.128 × 10^9 / 7.776 × 10^5 ≈ 7.88 × 10^3 m/s ≈ 7.88 km/s.\n\nSo Star4 has an equatorial velocity of about 7.88 km/s.\n\nNow comparing all the calculated velocities:\n\n- Star1: ~4.76 km/s\n- Star2: ~3.8 km/s\n- Star3: ~6.2 km/s\n- Star4: ~7.88 km/s\n\nSo the fastest is Star4 with ~7.88 km/s. Wait, but let me check if I did all calculations correctly.\n\nFor Star3, the projected velocity is 3.1 km/s, and the inclination is 30 degrees. So v = 3.1 / sin(30°) = 3.1 / 0.5 = 6.2 km/s. That's correct.\n\nFor Star4, the period is 9 days, radius 1.4 solar radii. Let me recalculate:\n\nR = 1.4 * 6.96e8 = 9.744e8 m. Period is 9 days = 9 * 86400 = 777600 seconds. v = 2πR / P = 2 * π * 9.744e8 / 777600.\n\nLet me compute 2 * π * 9.744e8 ≈ 6.128e9 m. Divided by 777600 s ≈ 7.88e3 m/s = 7.88 km/s. Correct.\n\nStar1: 4.76 km/s. Star3: 6.2 km/s. Star4: ~7.88 km/s. So the answer should be Star4, which is option D? Wait the options are A: Star2, B: Star3, C: Star4, D: Star1. So the answer is C: Star4.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check Star1. The calculation for Star1 gave 4.76 km/s. But maybe I made an error in the formula. The Doppler broadening is Δλ = (λ * v / c) * sin(i). Since we are told to ignore inclination, sin(i) is 1. So v = (Δλ * c) / λ. Let me confirm the numbers again.\n\nΔλ is 0.1 Å, λ is 6300 Å. So v = (0.1 / 6300) * c. 0.1 / 6300 is approximately 1.587e-5. Multiply by c (3e8 m/s) gives 1.587e-5 * 3e8 ≈ 4.76e3 m/s = 4.76 km/s. Correct.\n\nSo yes, Star4 is the fastest with ~7.88 km/s, so the answer is C: Star4.\n</think>"}
