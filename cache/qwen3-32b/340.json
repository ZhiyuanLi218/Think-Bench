This is a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, where a six-membered ring (formed via a Diels-Alder reaction) is cleaved into a diene and a dienophile. In this case, the diene is **2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene**, and the dienophile is **maleonitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### Key Concept: Le Chatelier's Principle\nWhen a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it shifts to counteract the disturbance. For example:\n- **Adding a reactant** shifts the equilibrium toward products.\n- **Removing a product** shifts the equilibrium toward products.\n- **Adding a product** shifts the equilibrium toward reactants.\n\n---\n\n### Role of Maleic Anhydride\n**Maleic anhydride** is a well-known **dienophile** in Diels-Alder reactions. While it is not a direct participant in the original retro-Diels-Alder reaction (which involves maleonitrile as the dienophile), it can **react with the diene product** (2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene) in a new Diels-Alder reaction.

So, the question is about a reaction where 4,5-dimethylcyclohex-4-ene-1,2-dicarbonitrile is converted into 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene and maleonitrile. The question is why adding maleic anhydride causes the reaction to shift more to the right. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Le Chatelier's principle. That's the principle that states if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the system will shift to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium. So, if you add more of a reactant, the equilibrium shifts to the right to produce more products. If you remove a product, the equilibrium shifts to the right to produce more of that product. Conversely, adding a product would shift the equilibrium to the left.\n\nNow, looking at the reaction given: the starting material is 4,5-dimethylcyclohex-4-ene-1,2-dicarbonitrile, and the products are 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene and maleonitrile. The question is about adding maleic anhydride. The options suggest different interactions between maleic anhydride and the reaction components.\n\nOption A says maleic anhydride reacts with the starting material, adding a reactant. If maleic anhydride is a reactant, adding it would shift the equilibrium to the right. But wait, the starting material is already the reactant here. Is maleic anhydride another reactant? Or is it something else?\n\nOption B states that maleic anhydride reacts with one of the products, 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene. If maleic anhydride reacts with a product, that would remove that product from the system. According to Le Chatelier's principle, removing a product would shift the equilibrium to the right to produce more of it. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption C says maleic anhydride converts into the starting material, shifting the equilibrium to the reactants. That would mean the reaction goes left, which contradicts the question's statement that the reaction shifts to the right. So probably not C.\n\nOption D claims maleic anhydride converts into maleonitrile, adding a product. Adding a product would shift the equilibrium to the left, but the question states the reaction shifts to the right. So D is likely incorrect.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if maleic anhydride is reacting with a reactant or a product. The name \"maleic anhydride\" suggests it's a cyclic anhydride of maleic acid. It's often used in Diels-Alder reactions as a dienophile. But in this case, the reaction is breaking down a cyclohexene into a diene and maleonitrile. Wait, maybe this is a retro-Diels-Alder reaction? The starting material is a six-membered ring with a diene and two nitriles. If the reaction is breaking down into a diene and maleonitrile, that would be a retro-Diels-Alder. \n\nIn a Diels-Alder reaction, a diene and a dienophile combine to form a six-membered ring. The reverse (retro-Diels-Alder) would break the ring. So if the starting material is the Diels-Alder adduct, then the products are the diene (2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene) and the dienophile (maleonitrile). \n\nNow, maleic anhydride is a common dienophile. If maleic anhydride is added, maybe it's reacting with the diene product, 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene, in a Diels-Alder reaction. If maleic anhydride reacts with the diene product, that would remove the diene from the system. According to Le Chatelier's principle, removing a product (the diene) would shift the equilibrium to the right to produce more of it. So that would support option B.\n\nAlternatively, if maleic anhydride is acting as a reactant here, but in the original reaction, the dienophile is maleonitrile. If maleic anhydride is a different compound, maybe it's not directly part of the reaction. But if it reacts with the diene product, that would make sense.\n\nLet me check the structures. Maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. Maleonitrile is a compound with two nitrile groups on adjacent carbons. The starting material has a cyclohexene ring with two nitriles on adjacent carbons. The product is a diene and maleonitrile. So the retro-Diels-Alder would break the six-membered ring into the diene and maleonitrile. \n\nIf maleic anhydride is added and it reacts with the diene product (2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene), that would remove the diene, shifting the equilibrium to the right to produce more diene. That would mean the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, if maleic anhydride is a different compound that's acting as a reactant here, but I don't think so. Since maleic anhydride is not the same as maleonitrile. Maleonitrile would be something like butadiene dinitrile. So maybe the maleic anhydride isn't part of the original reaction but is being added to react with one of the products. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: Maleic anhydride reacts with 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene and removal of a product causes the equilibrium to shift towards products.\n</think>"}
