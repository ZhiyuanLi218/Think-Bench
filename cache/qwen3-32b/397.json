We need to find the probability that they finish the season with more wins than losses. The answer should be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since each match is independent and there are 6 matches, the total number of possible outcomes is 3^6. But since we need probabilities, maybe we can think in terms of counting the number of favorable outcomes (where wins > losses) and then divide by 3^6. But maybe generating functions or recursion could be helpful here. Alternatively, maybe we can model it with combinations.\n\nLet me think. Let W, L, T be the number of wins, losses, and ties, respectively. We know that W + L + T = 6. We need to find the probability that W > L. Since each outcome is independent and each has probability 1/3, the probability for each particular combination (W, L, T) is (1/3)^6 multiplied by the number of ways to arrange those W, L, T. So the total probability would be the sum over all valid (W, L, T) with W > L of [6! / (W! L! T!)].\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of multinomial coefficients for all triples (W, L, T) where W + L + T = 6 and W > L, then dividing by 3^6. Then reduce the fraction and add m + n.\n\nBut how do we compute that sum? Let me think. Since there are only 6 matches, maybe we can iterate over possible values of W and L such that W > L and T = 6 - W - L. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, note that W and L must satisfy 0 ≤ W, L ≤ 6, W + L ≤ 6, and W > L. So for each possible value of W from 0 to 6, we can determine the possible values of L such that L < W and T = 6 - W - L ≥ 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of it as for each possible number of wins W from 0 to 6, then for each W, the number of losses can be from 0 up to min(W - 1, 6 - W). Wait, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nFor a given number of wins W, the number of losses L must satisfy L < W and also since T = 6 - W - L must be non-negative, so L ≤ 6 - W. Therefore, for each W, L can range from 0 to min(W - 1, 6 - W). Wait, not quite. For example, if W is 3, then L can be from 0 to 2 (since L < W), but also T = 6 - 3 - L = 3 - L ≥ 0, so L ≤ 3. Since 3 - L ≥ 0 implies L ≤ 3. But since W is 3 and L < W, L can be 0,1,2. So for each W, L can be from 0 to floor(W - 1), but also T must be non-negative. Therefore, for each W, the upper bound on L is min(W - 1, 6 - W). Wait, 6 - W is the maximum number of L + T. Since T ≥ 0, then L can be up to 6 - W. However, since L must be less than W, then L can be up to min(W - 1, 6 - W). Wait, but 6 - W is the total number of non-win games. So if W is fixed, then L can be from 0 to 6 - W (since T can be 6 - W - L). But we also have the condition that L < W. Therefore, for each W, L ranges from 0 to min(W - 1, 6 - W). Wait, but min(W - 1, 6 - W) depends on W.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into cases based on W.\n\nLet me try to compute for each W from 0 to 6, the number of possible L and T such that L < W and T = 6 - W - L ≥ 0.\n\nFirst, note that for W = 0: L must be less than 0, which is impossible, so no contribution.\n\nFor W = 1: L can be 0 (since L < 1). Then T = 6 - 1 - 0 = 5. So only one possibility for L, which is 0. So for W=1, L=0, T=5. The number of arrangements is 6! / (1! 0! 5!) = 6.\n\nFor W = 2: L can be 0 or 1 (since L < 2). But also, T = 6 - 2 - L = 4 - L. Since T must be ≥ 0, so 4 - L ≥ 0 => L ≤ 4. But since L can be up to 1 here (because L < 2), no problem. Therefore, L=0 and L=1.\n\nFor L=0: T=4, number of arrangements: 6! / (2! 0! 4!) = 15.\n\nFor L=1: T=3, number of arrangements: 6! / (2! 1! 3!) = 60.\n\nTotal for W=2: 15 + 60 = 75.\n\nFor W=3: L must be less than 3, so L=0,1,2. Also T = 6 - 3 - L = 3 - L ≥ 0. Since L can be up to 2, T=3 - L ≥ 1 ≥ 0. So all three L values allowed.\n\nFor L=0: T=3, arrangements: 6! / (3! 0! 3!) = 20.\n\nFor L=1: T=2, arrangements: 6! / (3! 1! 2!) = 60.\n\nFor L=2: T=1, arrangements: 6! / (3! 2! 1!) = 60.\n\nTotal for W=3: 20 + 60 + 60 = 140.\n\nFor W=4: L must be less than 4, so L=0,1,2,3. Also T = 6 - 4 - L = 2 - L. Wait, T must be ≥ 0. Therefore, 2 - L ≥ 0 => L ≤ 2. Therefore, even though L can be up to 3 (since L < 4), the T constraint restricts L to be ≤ 2. Therefore, L=0,1,2.\n\nFor L=0: T=2, arrangements: 6! / (4! 0! 2!) = 15.\n\nFor L=1: T=1, arrangements: 6! / (4! 1! 1!) = 30.\n\nFor L=2: T=0, arrangements: 6! / (4! 2! 0!) = 15.\n\nTotal for W=4: 15 + 30 + 15 = 60.\n\nFor W=5: L must be less than 5, so L=0,1,2,3,4. But T = 6 - 5 - L = 1 - L. Since T ≥ 0, 1 - L ≥ 0 => L ≤ 1. Therefore, L can be 0 or 1.\n\nFor L=0: T=1, arrangements: 6! / (5! 0! 1!) = 6.\n\nFor L=1: T=0, arrangements: 6! / (5! 1! 0!) = 6.\n\nTotal for W=5: 6 + 6 = 12.\n\nFor W=6: L must be less than 6, so L=0,...,5. However, T = 6 - 6 - L = -L. Since T must be ≥ 0, this implies L ≤ 0. Therefore, L=0. So only one case: L=0, T=0. Number of arrangements: 6! / (6! 0! 0!) = 1.\n\nTotal for W=6: 1.\n\nNow, let's sum up all these numbers:\n\nW=1: 6\n\nW=2: 75\n\nW=3: 140\n\nW=4: 60\n\nW=5: 12\n\nW=6: 1\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 6 + 75 + 140 + 60 + 12 + 1 = Let's compute step by step:\n\nStart with 6 + 75 = 81\n\n81 + 140 = 221\n\n221 + 60 = 281\n\n281 + 12 = 293\n\n293 + 1 = 294.\n\nSo total favorable outcomes are 294.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 3^6 = 729.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 294 / 729. Let's simplify that fraction.\n\nFirst, check if both numbers are divisible by 3. 294 ÷ 3 = 98, 729 ÷ 3 = 243. So 98 / 243. Check if they have common divisors. 98 factors: 2 * 49 = 2 * 7^2. 243 is 3^5. No common factors. Therefore, reduced fraction is 98/243. Therefore, m = 98, n = 243. Then m + n = 98 + 243 = 341.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when doing casework, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, let me verify the counts for each W:\n\nFor W=1: 6. Correct, since it's 6 choose 1, 0, 5: 6!/(1!0!5!)=6. Correct.\n\nFor W=2: 15 + 60 = 75. Let me check:\n\nFor L=0: 6!/(2!0!4!)= (720)/(2*1*24)= 720 / 48 = 15. Correct.\n\nFor L=1: 6!/(2!1!3!)= 720 / (2*1*6)= 720 / 12 = 60. Correct. Total 75. Correct.\n\nFor W=3:\n\nL=0: 6!/(3!0!3!)= 720 / (6*1*6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Correct.\n\nL=1: 6!/(3!1!2!)= 720 / (6*1*2)= 720 / 12 = 60. Correct.\n\nL=2: 6!/(3!2!1!)= 720 / (6*2*1)= 720 / 12 = 60. Correct. Total 20 + 60 + 60 = 140. Correct.\n\nFor W=4:\n\nL=0: 6!/(4!0!2!)= 720 / (24*1*2) = 720 / 48 = 15. Correct.\n\nL=1: 6!/(4!1!1!)= 720 / (24*1*1)= 30. Correct.\n\nL=2: 6!/(4!2!0!)= same as L=0, which is 15. Correct. Total 15 + 30 +15 = 60. Correct.\n\nFor W=5:\n\nL=0: 6!/(5!0!1!)= 720 / (120*1*1)= 6. Correct.\n\nL=1: 6!/(5!1!0!)= same as above, 6. Correct. Total 12. Correct.\n\nFor W=6: 1. Correct.\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 6 + 75 + 140 + 60 + 12 + 1 = 294. Correct.\n\nTotal possible: 3^6 = 729. 3^6 is 729. Correct.\n\nSimplify 294 / 729. Let's check GCD(294, 729). Prime factors:\n\n294: 2 * 147 = 2 * 3 * 49 = 2 * 3 * 7^2.\n\n729: 3^6.\n\nCommon factor is 3. So divide numerator and denominator by 3: 294 / 3 = 98, 729 / 3 = 243. Then 98 and 243. 98 is 2 * 49 = 2 * 7^2. 243 is 3^5. No common factors. So yes, 98/243. Therefore, m + n = 98 + 243 = 341. So answer is 341.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using symmetry or complementary counting, to verify.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 3^6. The probability that W > L is equal to the probability that L > W, by symmetry? Wait, not exactly, because there are cases where W = L. Let me think.\n\nIf we consider that for each outcome, either W > L, W < L, or W = L. So the total probability is 1 = P(W > L) + P(W < L) + P(W = L). If we can compute P(W = L) and then note that P(W > L) = P(W < L) due to symmetry? Is that true?\n\nBut the problem is that the number of wins and losses aren't symmetric because the number of games is even or odd? Wait, the number of games is 6, which is even. However, each game can result in a win, loss, or tie. So maybe there is some symmetry here. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we swap the roles of wins and losses. Since each game has probability 1/3 for win, 1/3 for loss, 1/3 for tie. If we swap win and loss, the probability distribution remains the same. Therefore, the probability that W > L is equal to the probability that L > W. Therefore, P(W > L) = P(L > W). Therefore, 1 = 2 * P(W > L) + P(W = L). Therefore, P(W > L) = [1 - P(W = L)] / 2.\n\nSo if we can compute P(W = L), then we can find the desired probability. Maybe this is easier? Let me try.\n\nSo let's compute P(W = L). So the number of sequences where number of wins equals number of losses. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me think. For W = L, since there are 6 games, let me denote W = L = k. Then the number of ties is 6 - 2k. Since the number of ties must be non-negative, 6 - 2k ≥ 0 => k ≤ 3. So k can be 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nFor each k from 0 to 3, compute the number of sequences where there are k wins, k losses, and 6 - 2k ties.\n\nFor each k, the number of such sequences is 6! / (k! k! (6 - 2k)! )\n\nSo let's compute for each k:\n\nk=0: 0 wins, 0 losses, 6 ties. Number of sequences: 6! / (0! 0! 6!) = 1.\n\nk=1: 1 win, 1 loss, 4 ties. Number of sequences: 6! / (1! 1! 4!) = 720 / (1*1*24) = 30.\n\nk=2: 2 wins, 2 losses, 2 ties. Number of sequences: 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 720 / (2*2*2) = 720 / 8 = 90.\n\nk=3: 3 wins, 3 losses, 0 ties. Number of sequences: 6! / (3! 3! 0!) = 720 / (6*6*1) = 720 / 36 = 20.\n\nTotal number of sequences with W = L is 1 + 30 + 90 + 20 = 141.\n\nTherefore, P(W = L) = 141 / 729. Therefore, P(W > L) = (1 - 141/729)/2 = (729 - 141)/ (2 * 729) = 588 / 1458 = Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 6: 588 / 6 = 98, 1458 / 6 = 243. Therefore, 98 / 243. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, the probability is indeed 98/243, so m + n is 341. Therefore, the answer is 341. So seems like both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another approach. For example, using generating functions. Let me try.\n\nThe generating function for each game is x^1 + x^{-1} + x^0, where x^1 represents a win (increasing the difference between wins and losses by 1), x^{-1} represents a loss (decreasing the difference by 1), and x^0 represents a tie (no change). However, since we need to track the difference between wins and losses, maybe we can model it with generating functions.\n\nBut since we have 6 games, the generating function would be (x + 1/x + 1)^6. The coefficient of x^k in this expansion would represent the number of ways to have a difference of k between wins and losses. Then, we need the sum of coefficients for all x^k where k > 0, then divide by 3^6.\n\nBut calculating that might be complex, but maybe we can use symmetry again. However, since we already have two methods giving 98/243, maybe it's not necessary. But just for thoroughness, let me see.\n\nAlternatively, note that the difference D = W - L. We need P(D > 0). Since D can range from -6 to +6. And as before, due to symmetry, P(D > 0) = P(D < 0). And P(D = 0) = 141 / 729 as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the generating function coefficients. Let me try for small exponents.\n\nBut given that we already have two methods leading to the same answer, maybe it's safe. However, let me check the total number of sequences where W = L is 141. Let me check that again:\n\nFor k=0: 1.\n\nk=1: 6! / (1! 1! 4!) = (720)/(1*1*24) = 30. Correct.\n\nk=2: 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 720 / 8 = 90. Correct.\n\nk=3: 6! / (3! 3! 0!) = 20. Correct. Total: 1 + 30 + 90 + 20 = 141. Correct. So P(W = L) is 141 / 729. Then P(W > L) is (1 - 141/729)/2 = (588)/1458 = 98/243. Correct.\n\nTherefore, answer is 98 + 243 = 341.\n\nBut let me check if 98 and 243 are coprime. Prime factors of 98: 2 * 49 = 2 * 7^2. Prime factors of 243: 3^5. No common factors, yes. Therefore, reduced fraction. Therefore, answer is 341.\n\nTherefore, I think confident that the answer is 341.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{341}\n</think>"}
