Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: The experiment involves adding KSCN to FeSO4 solution and then adding chlorine water. The purpose is to demonstrate that Fe²+ has reducing properties. \n\nI remember that Fe²+ can be oxidized to Fe³+ by a strong oxidizing agent like chlorine water. When KSCN is added, it doesn't react with Fe²+ directly, but when Fe³+ is present, it forms a blood-red complex with SCN⁻. So initially, the solution with FeSO4 and KSCN might not show much color. Then, when chlorine water is added, it oxidizes Fe²+ to Fe³+, which then reacts with SCN⁻ to give a red color. This would show that Fe²+ was present and was oxidized, hence showing its reducing properties. So this experiment should work. So A is probably okay.\n\nMoving to option B: Adding fuchsin solution to SO2 aqueous solution, shaking, then heating and observing color change. The purpose is to show that SO2 has bleaching properties.\n\nFuchsin is a dye that gets decolorized when it reacts with bleaching agents. I know that SO2 has bleaching properties due to its reducing action, especially with organic dyes. When SO2 is added to fuchsin solution, it should decolorize it. Upon heating, if the bleaching is due to SO2, then heating might reverse the reaction, causing the solution to regain color. Because heating would drive off SO2 gas, and if the bleaching is temporary (like with SO2), the color should return. So if the solution fades when SO2 is added and then turns back when heated, that supports the bleaching property of SO2. So this experiment should work. So B might be okay.\n\nOption C: Adding bromine water to starch-KI solution and observing color change. Purpose is to show that Br2's oxidizing property is stronger than I2.\n\nStarch-KI solution turns blue when I2 is present because I2 forms a complex with starch. If Br2 is added to KI solution, Br2 can oxidize I⁻ to I2. The reaction would be Br2 + 2I⁻ → 2Br⁻ + I2. Since the solution turns blue with starch, that would indicate I2 formation. This shows that Br2 is a stronger oxidizing agent than I2 because it can oxidize I⁻ to I2. Therefore, the experiment should work. So C is okay.\n\nOption D: Using a pH meter to measure pH of acetic acid and HCl, comparing the pH to show that CH3COOH is a weak electrolyte.\n\nHCl is a strong acid, completely dissociated in solution, while acetic acid is a weak acid, partially dissociated. So for the same concentration, acetic acid would have a higher pH than HCl. If you measure their pH, the lower pH for HCl indicates higher concentration of H+ ions, showing that acetic acid doesn't fully dissociate, hence is a weak electrolyte. However, this depends on the concentrations being the same. If the problem states that they are using solutions of the same concentration, then yes, comparing pH would work. But if the concentrations are different, maybe not. But the problem doesn't mention different concentrations. The question says \"acetic acid and hydrochloric acid\"—assuming same concentration? Typically, in such experiments, you compare same concentration. Therefore, measuring pH would show that acetic acid has a higher pH, hence weaker acid, so D should work. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"compare the pH of the solutions\". If they are of the same concentration, then yes. However, if they are of different concentrations, you can't. But the question doesn't specify. However, in standard lab experiments like this, unless stated otherwise, it's usually same concentration. Therefore, the experiment D should achieve the purpose. \n\nSo all the experiments seem to achieve their purposes? But the question says which one cannot. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at option D: If you measure pH of acetic acid and HCl, assuming same concentration, acetic acid's pH would be higher. Therefore, the lower pH of HCl shows that it is a strong acid (fully dissociated), while acetic acid is partially dissociated, hence weak electrolyte. Therefore, D can achieve the purpose.\n\nWait, but what if the concentrations are not the same? Suppose the problem didn't specify same concentration. Then, maybe you can't conclude. But since the problem is about the experimental scheme, maybe the scheme is flawed if they don't use same concentration. However, in the description of D, it just says \"measure pH of acetic acid and hydrochloric acid, compare pH\". The problem is whether the experiment is designed properly. If the concentrations are same, it works. But if they are not, it doesn't. However, the problem doesn't state that they are using same concentration. So is the experimental scheme as described sufficient?\n\nIn real lab settings, to compare strength, you need same concentration. So if the experiment does not specify same concentration, then the conclusion might not hold. But the question is about whether the experimental scheme cannot achieve the purpose. If the person doing the experiment uses same concentration, then it works. But if the scheme does not specify, maybe it's a flaw. However, in the context of the question, maybe we assume that the concentrations are same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another issue. For example, if you have two solutions of same concentration, but maybe the pH meter is not accurate? No, pH meters are generally reliable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D? Because even though acetic acid is a weak acid, if the concentration is very low, maybe the pH could be similar? But again, unless concentrations are specified, but I think in standard comparison, same concentration is assumed. So I'm confused. Maybe I need to check other options again.\n\nWait, let me think again about option B. When SO2 is added to fuchsin solution, it decolorizes. Upon heating, if you heat it, the SO2 might escape, and the color should return. But if the solution is heated, does it decompose? Or is the decolorization reversible? Yes, I think that's the case. So when you heat, the color returns. Therefore, the experiment would work. So B is okay.\n\nSo then, which one is wrong? All are okay? But the question says one cannot. Maybe I made a mistake with option C?\n\nOption C: Adding bromine water to starch-KI solution. Bromine water is Br2 in water. The reaction between Br2 and KI is Br2 + 2I⁻ → 2Br⁻ + I2. The I2 then forms complex with starch, turning blue. So the solution should turn blue. This shows that Br2 can oxidize I⁻ to I2, hence Br2 is a stronger oxidizing agent than I2. So this is correct. Therefore, C is okay.\n\nSo all options seem okay? But the question says one cannot. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each again.\n\nOption A: Adding KSCN to FeSO4. Fe²+ does not react with SCN⁻, so initially no color. Then adding Cl2 water, which oxidizes Fe²+ to Fe³+. Fe³+ reacts with SCN⁻ to form blood red complex. Therefore, the solution turns red. This shows Fe²+ was oxidized, so it has reducing properties. Correct.\n\nOption B: Fuchsin + SO2, decolorizes. Heating, color returns. Correct, because SO2's bleaching is temporary. Correct.\n\nOption C: Br2 oxidizes I⁻ to I2, which gives blue color with starch. Correct.\n\nOption D: Comparing pH of CH3COOH and HCl. If same concentration, HCl has lower pH. Therefore, shows CH3COOH is weak. But if the concentrations are different, it might not. But the problem says \"acetic acid and hydrochloric acid\"—maybe they are of same concentration? If the experimental scheme doesn't specify same concentration, then the conclusion may not hold. However, in the context of a textbook question, unless stated otherwise, it's usually assumed that concentrations are same when comparing acid strengths. Therefore, D is okay.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. For example, if you have two acids of same pH, but different concentrations, but that's not the case here. The question is about measuring pH to show that CH3COOH is weak. For example, if you have 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M CH3COOH. HCl will have pH ~1, while CH3COOH will have pH around 2.8 or something. Therefore, the pH difference shows that CH3COOH is weaker. Therefore, the experiment works. So D is okay.\n\nBut then all four experiments can achieve their purpose? But the question says one cannot. There must be an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe option D's purpose is to show that CH3COOH is a weak electrolyte. But measuring pH is one way to do it. However, maybe there's a problem with the method? For example, if the solutions are not of the same concentration. But the problem statement for D does not specify concentrations. However, in a laboratory experiment, if you just measure pH of any two solutions of acetic acid and HCl, you might not get the desired result unless concentrations are controlled. So if the experimental scheme does not specify using same concentration, then the conclusion may not be valid. Therefore, the scheme is flawed because it doesn't specify same concentration. Therefore, option D cannot achieve the purpose unless concentrations are same. But since the question is about whether the scheme as described can achieve the purpose, and since the description does not mention same concentration, then maybe D cannot achieve the purpose? But in reality, in a lab, you would use same concentration. However, the problem is probably testing theoretical knowledge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another angle. For example, if you have two solutions, even if they are same concentration, but you measure pH, but maybe there are other factors? No, pH directly relates to H+ concentration. For strong acid, full dissociation, so [H+] = concentration. For weak acid, [H+] is less. Therefore, pH would be higher. Therefore, measuring pH would show that. Therefore, D is okay.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that if you have two solutions with same pH, but different concentrations, but that's not the case here. The experiment is to compare pH of the two acids. If you have same concentration, then pH difference indicates strength. Therefore, the scheme is okay. Therefore, all four options are okay? But the question says one cannot. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are A, B, C, D. The answer must be one of them. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps option B is not correct? The reasoning was that SO2 bleaches fuchsin, and heating reverses it. But what if the decolorization is due to SO2's reducing property, and upon heating, the color returns? Yes, that's correct. So B is okay.\n\nOption C: Adding bromine water to starch-KI solution. But bromine water is brown, and when it reacts with KI, it produces I2. However, if there's excess Br2, the solution might remain brown. But if you add just a few drops, maybe enough to oxidize I⁻ to I2 without excess Br2. Then with starch, it turns blue. Therefore, correct.\n\nOption A: Adding KSCN to FeSO4. Fe²+ doesn't form complex with SCN⁻. Then adding Cl2 water oxidizes Fe²+ to Fe³+, which does form complex. So turns red. Therefore, correct.\n\nSo if all are correct, but the question says one is not... Maybe I made a mistake with option D. Let me think again. The purpose is to show that CH3COOH is a weak electrolyte. A weak electrolyte means it doesn't fully dissociate in solution. Measuring pH is a valid way because if it were a strong electrolyte (like HCl), it would fully dissociate, giving lower pH. Therefore, if the pH of acetic acid is higher than HCl at same concentration, then it is weaker. So D is correct. \n\nWait, but what if the concentrations are different? Suppose you have 0.1 M acetic acid and 1 M HCl. The pH of HCl would be 0, and acetic acid's pH would be higher. But even though acetic acid is weak, the lower concentration might result in higher pH. But in the experiment, if the concentrations are not controlled, you can't compare. However, the experimental scheme as described doesn't specify concentrations. Therefore, if someone does the experiment without controlling concentrations, they might get misleading results. But the question is about whether the scheme can achieve the purpose. In other words, if the scheme is properly designed. If the scheme is to compare pH of solutions of same concentration, then it works. If not, it doesn't. Since the description doesn't specify, is the scheme flawed?\n\nIn an exam setting, when such a question is asked, usually you assume that the concentrations are same unless stated otherwise. Therefore, D is okay. But maybe the problem considers that measuring pH alone is not sufficient to prove that CH3COOH is a weak electrolyte. For example, maybe there are other factors. But no, pH is a direct measure of H+ concentration. If the acid is weak, it doesn't fully dissociate, so lower [H+], higher pH. So if you have same concentration, comparing pH is valid. Therefore, D is okay.\n\nBut since the question says one cannot achieve the purpose, and all others seem okay, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each again.\n\nWait, maybe option C is incorrect? Because Br2's oxidizing property is stronger than I2, so it can displace I2 from KI. But what if the starch-KI solution already contains I2? No, starch-KI solution usually refers to KI with starch as indicator. When I2 is produced, it turns blue. So adding Br2 to KI solution produces I2, which turns blue with starch. Hence, showing Br2 is stronger oxidizing agent than I2. Correct.\n\nWait, another thought: In option C, if you add bromine water to starch-KI solution, you need to make sure that Br2 is in excess or not? If Br2 is in excess, it might also react with I2 or starch? But usually, a few drops of bromine water would oxidize I⁻ to I2, and the excess Br2 would be in brown color, but with starch, the blue color indicates I2. So it should work.\n\nHmm. I'm going in circles here. Since all seem okay, but the question says one is not, maybe the answer is D? But why?\n\nWait, another angle: The purpose of D is to show that CH3COOH is a weak electrolyte. Measuring pH is one way, but maybe there's another method. However, the question is about whether this method works. Suppose you have two solutions, acetic acid and HCl, same concentration. The pH of HCl is lower, which shows that acetic acid is weaker. Therefore, the experiment works. So D is okay.\n\nWait, but what if the acetic acid is dilute? No, if same concentration as HCl, then it's valid. \n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I need to check standard answers for such questions. In some cases, comparing pH might not be sufficient because maybe the measurement is not precise enough? But with a pH meter, it's precise. So D is okay.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that both acetic acid and HCl are monoprotic, so the comparison is valid. If you had a diprotic acid, maybe different, but no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B? Let me think again. If you add SO2 to fuchsin solution, it decolorizes. Heating makes it return. But what if the decolorization is not due to bleaching but due to something else? No, SO2's bleaching is well-known for temporary decolorization of dyes, which is reversed upon heating. So B is okay.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is A? Let me check again. Adding KSCN to FeSO4. Fe²+ does not form a complex with SCN⁻. Then adding Cl2 water oxidizes Fe²+ to Fe³+, which does form the red complex. So this shows Fe²+ was oxidized, hence has reducing properties. Correct. So A is okay.\n\nWait, maybe there's a problem with the order of adding? Suppose you add Cl2 water first, then KSCN? But the experiment says add KSCN first, then Cl2 water. That's correct, because initially no color, then after oxidation, color appears. So A is okay.\n\nAll right, I'm going to have to conclude that maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Since all seem okay, but the question says one isn't, and given the options, maybe the answer is D? But I don't see why. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C? Let me check the reaction again.\n\nBr2 + 2I⁻ → 2Br⁻ + I2. This shows that Br2 is stronger oxidizing agent than I2 because it can oxidize I⁻ to I2. Correct. So C is okay.\n\nWait, but what if the bromine water is not in excess? Suppose you add a few drops, and it reacts completely. Then you get I2, which gives blue color. Correct. \n\nHmm. I'm really not seeing it. Maybe the answer is D? Let me think again. If you measure pH of acetic acid and HCl, but suppose they are of the same concentration. The pH of acetic acid is higher, so shows it's weaker. Therefore, D works. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is about electrolyte strength. A weak electrolyte means it doesn't fully dissociate. But measuring pH is a way to show that. For example, if you have a 0.1 M solution of HCl (strong electrolyte), it dissociates completely, giving [H+] = 0.1 M, pH=1. Acetic acid, weak electrolyte, has lower [H+], higher pH. Therefore, D works. \n\nTherefore, I think all options can achieve their purpose. But since the question says one cannot, maybe I made a mistake. But given the options, I have to choose one. Since I have to pick, and I can't find any flaw, maybe the intended answer is D? Or maybe B?\n\nWait, another thought about option B: When you add fuchsin to SO2 solution, the SO2 is dissolved in water, forming H2SO3, which acts as a reducing agent. The bleaching is due to the reducing properties of SO2. However, if the solution is heated, the SO2 gas is released, and the color returns. Therefore, the experiment shows that the bleaching is temporary and due to reduction. Therefore, the purpose is achieved. So B is okay.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given that, maybe the answer is D? Because measuring pH alone might not be sufficient? For example, if the acetic acid is concentrated, but the pH is measured, but maybe there are other factors? No, pH is a direct measure. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the pH meter measures the activity of H+ ions, which for weak acids might be affected by ionic strength? Probably negligible in dilute solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in Chinese, and there's a translation issue? The original question is in Chinese? Well, the user provided the question in English. \n\nGiven that I can't find any flaw, and the question requires an answer, I'll have to go with the one I'm least sure about, which is D. Maybe the problem considers that measuring pH is not sufficient to prove weak electrolyte? But I don't see why. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B? No, B seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check standard experiments. For example, in textbooks, comparing pH of strong and weak acids of same concentration is a standard way to show weak acid. So D is correct. \n\nIf all are correct, but the question says one isn't, there must be a mistake in my analysis. Let me check each again quickly.\n\nA: Fe²+ is oxidized by Cl2 to Fe³+, shown by KSCN. Correct.\n\nB: SO2 bleaches fuchsin, reversible by heating. Correct.\n\nC: Br2 oxidizes I⁻ to I2, shown by starch. Correct.\n\nD: pH comparison shows acetic acid is weak. Correct.\n\nBut since the options are given, and the answer must be one of them, perhaps the intended answer is D? Or maybe I missed something in option C?\n\nWait, what if the starch-KI solution already contains I2? No, it's starch-KI solution, which is KI with starch as indicator. When I2 is produced, it turns blue. So correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: If bromine water is added to starch-KI solution, the Br2 might also react with starch? But I think the primary reaction is Br2 oxidizing I⁻ to I2, and the I2 then forms complex with starch. Br2 itself might not react with starch. So C is okay.\n\nMaybe the answer is D? Let me think again. Suppose you have two acids, same concentration, but one is strong and one is weak. The pH of the weak acid is higher. Therefore, measuring pH shows that. Therefore, D is okay.\n\nI'm really not seeing it. Since the user says \"at room temperature,\" maybe some reactions are temperature-dependent? But all the experiments are at room temperature.\n\nWait, option B: heating the test tube. The experiment involves heating after adding SO2. If at room temperature, the SO2 is dissolved, and heating drives it off. So yes, the color returns. Correct.\n\nI'm forced to conclude that all are correct, but since the question says one isn't, perhaps there's a trick. Maybe in option D, if the concentrations are the same, but the acetic acid is actually a strong electrolyte, then the pH would be the same as HCl. But the experiment is to show that it is a weak electrolyte by showing different pH. Therefore, the experiment works. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that pH depends on concentration and strength, but if you don't know the concentration, you can't conclude. But in the experiment, you are comparing two solutions, so if they are same concentration, you can conclude. If they are not, you can't. But the experiment as described does not specify concentrations. Therefore, the scheme is flawed because it doesn't specify same concentration. Hence, D cannot achieve the purpose unless concentrations are same. Since the description does not mention same concentration, the scheme is not sufficient. Therefore, D cannot achieve the purpose.\n\nYes, this must be it. The question is about whether the experimental scheme as described can achieve the purpose. If the scheme does not specify that the concentrations of acetic acid and HCl are the same, then comparing their pH values is not sufficient to conclude that acetic acid is a weak electrolyte. For example, if acetic acid is more concentrated than HCl, its pH could be higher even if it were a strong acid. Therefore, the experimental scheme is flawed because it lacks the control of same concentration. Hence, option D cannot achieve the purpose.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
