Let me start by recalling what the problem says. \n\nWe have four variables: x, y, z, and w. All of x, y, z exceed 1, and w is a positive number. The given information is:\n\n- log base x of w is 24. So, log_x(w) = 24.\n- log base y of w is 40. So, log_y(w) = 40.\n- log base (xyz) of w is 12. So, log_{xyz}(w) = 12.\n\nWe need to find log_z(w). \n\nHmm. Since logarithms can sometimes be tricky, maybe I should convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form. That might make it easier to relate them. \n\nStarting with log_x(w) = 24. Converting to exponential form, that means x^24 = w. Similarly, log_y(w) = 40 implies y^40 = w. And log_{xyz}(w) = 12 implies (xyz)^12 = w. \n\nSo, we have three expressions for w:\n\n1. w = x^24\n2. w = y^40\n3. w = (xyz)^12\n\nSince all of these equal w, they must equal each other. So, for example, x^24 = y^40, and also x^24 = (xyz)^12. Let me write those equations down:\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2: x^24 = y^40. \n\nFrom equations 1 and 3: x^24 = (xyz)^12.\n\nLet me first work with the first one: x^24 = y^40. Maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa? Let me try solving for y in terms of x. \n\nTaking both sides to the power of 1/40:\n\n(x^24)^(1/40) = y^(40 * 1/40)\n\nWhich simplifies to x^(24/40) = y^(1). \n\nSimplify 24/40: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 3/5. So x^(3/5) = y. \n\nTherefore, y = x^(3/5). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this as y^5 = x^3? Let me check. If y = x^(3/5), then y^5 = [x^(3/5)]^5 = x^3. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, that's one relationship between x and y. \n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: x^24 = (xyz)^12. Let me expand the right-hand side. \n\n(xyz)^12 = x^12 * y^12 * z^12. \n\nSo, x^24 = x^12 * y^12 * z^12. \n\nLet me divide both sides by x^12:\n\nx^24 / x^12 = y^12 * z^12 => x^(24 - 12) = y^12 * z^12 => x^12 = y^12 * z^12. \n\nTaking both sides to the power of 1/12:\n\nx^(12 * 1/12) = (y^12 * z^12)^(1/12) => x^1 = y * z. \n\nTherefore, x = y * z. \n\nSo, we have another relationship: x equals y times z. \n\nEarlier, we had y = x^(3/5). Let me substitute that into this equation. \n\nx = y * z => x = [x^(3/5)] * z. \n\nSolving for z:\n\nDivide both sides by x^(3/5):\n\nx / x^(3/5) = z. \n\nSimplify the left-hand side: x^(1 - 3/5) = x^(2/5). Therefore, z = x^(2/5). \n\nSo, z = x^(2/5). \n\nAlternatively, z^5 = x^2. \n\nSo now we have relationships between x, y, z. \n\nBut how does this help us find log_z(w)? \n\nWe need log_z(w). Let me recall that log_b(a) can be converted using change of base formula. For example, log_z(w) = log_x(w) / log_x(z). \n\nWait, we know log_x(w) is 24. So if I can find log_x(z), then I can compute log_z(w) as 24 divided by log_x(z). \n\nSince z = x^(2/5), then log_x(z) = log_x(x^(2/5)) = 2/5. \n\nTherefore, log_z(w) = 24 / (2/5) = 24 * (5/2) = 12 * 5 = 60. \n\nWait, so is the answer 60? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting from log_x(w) = 24 => w = x^24. \n\nlog_z(w) = log_z(x^24). Since z = x^(2/5), then log_{x^(2/5)}(x^24). \n\nUsing the change of base formula: log_{a^b}(c) = (1/b) * log_a(c). \n\nAlternatively, log_{x^(2/5)}(x^24) can be written as [log_x(x^24)] / [log_x(x^(2/5))] by change of base formula. \n\nWhich is 24 / (2/5) = 24 * 5/2 = 60. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using exponents. Since we have expressions for w in terms of x, y, z. \n\nWe also have w = (xyz)^12. But we also have w = x^24. Therefore, x^24 = (xyz)^12. Which we already used earlier. \n\nBut maybe another approach is to use the change of base formula for all the logarithms. \n\nLet me recall that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). \n\nAlternatively, log_b(a) = (log_c(a)) / (log_c(b)) for any base c. \n\nPerhaps converting all logs to base w? Let me try that. \n\nGiven log_x(w) = 24. Converting to base w: log_w(w) / log_w(x) = 24. Since log_w(w) = 1, so 1 / log_w(x) = 24 => log_w(x) = 1/24. \n\nSimilarly, log_y(w) = 40 => log_w(y) = 1/40. \n\nAlso, log_{xyz}(w) = 12 => log_w(xyz)/log_w(w) = 12. Wait, no. Again, using change of base formula: log_{xyz}(w) = log_w(w) / log_w(xyz) = 1 / log_w(xyz) = 12. Therefore, log_w(xyz) = 1/12. \n\nBut log_w(xyz) is log_w(x) + log_w(y) + log_w(z). \n\nTherefore, log_w(x) + log_w(y) + log_w(z) = 1/12. \n\nWe already know log_w(x) = 1/24 and log_w(y) = 1/40. Therefore, substituting:\n\n1/24 + 1/40 + log_w(z) = 1/12. \n\nSo, solving for log_w(z):\n\nlog_w(z) = 1/12 - 1/24 - 1/40. \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst, find common denominators. The denominators are 12, 24, 40. Let me find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. \n\nPrime factors:\n\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n\n40 = 2^3 * 5\n\nSo LCM is the maximum exponent for each prime: 2^3, 3^1, 5^1. Therefore, LCM = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120. \n\nSo converting each fraction to denominator 120:\n\n1/12 = 10/120\n\n1/24 = 5/120\n\n1/40 = 3/120\n\nTherefore:\n\nlog_w(z) = 10/120 - 5/120 - 3/120 = (10 - 5 - 3)/120 = 2/120 = 1/60. \n\nTherefore, log_w(z) = 1/60. \n\nBut we need log_z(w). Since log_z(w) is the reciprocal of log_w(z). Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). \n\nTherefore, log_z(w) = 1 / (1/60) = 60. \n\nSo that's the same answer as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 60. \n\nLet me check once again. \n\nFirst approach: using exponents, found that z = x^(2/5), then log_z(w) = 24 / (2/5) = 60. \n\nSecond approach: using log_w(x) + log_w(y) + log_w(z) = 1/12, found log_w(z) = 1/60, so log_z(w) = 60. \n\nBoth approaches give the same answer, so that gives me confidence that 60 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with actual numbers. Let me try to assign a value to x, compute y and z, then compute w and check the logs. \n\nLet me pick x such that calculations are easy. Let me choose x = 2^5 = 32? Wait, but earlier we had z = x^(2/5). So if x is a power that makes z a nice number. \n\nAlternatively, let me set x = 2^5, so that x^(2/5) = 2^2 = 4. Let me try that. \n\nLet me set x = 32 (which is 2^5). Then z = x^(2/5) = (2^5)^(2/5) = 2^(5*(2/5)) = 2^2 = 4. So z = 4. \n\nEarlier, we had y = x^(3/5). For x = 32 = 2^5, y = (2^5)^(3/5) = 2^(5*(3/5)) = 2^3 = 8. So y = 8. \n\nSo x = 32, y = 8, z = 4. \n\nNow compute w. From log_x(w) = 24, so w = x^24 = 32^24. \n\nAlternatively, check with other expressions. \n\nCheck if log_y(w) = 40. Since y = 8, then log_8(w) should be 40. Let's check: w = 32^24. \n\nExpress 32 as 2^5, so w = (2^5)^24 = 2^(120). \n\nExpress 8 as 2^3. Then log_8(2^120) = (log_2(2^120)) / (log_2(8)) = 120 / 3 = 40. Correct. \n\nSimilarly, check log_{xyz}(w) = 12. Compute xyz: x = 32, y = 8, z = 4. xyz = 32 * 8 * 4. Let me compute that:\n\n32 * 8 = 256; 256 * 4 = 1024. \n\nSo xyz = 1024. Which is 2^10. \n\nThen log_{1024}(w) = log_{2^10}(2^120) = (log_2(2^120)) / (log_2(2^10)) = 120 / 10 = 12. Correct. \n\nNow compute log_z(w). z is 4, which is 2^2. w is 2^120. So log_4(2^120). \n\nWhich is (log_2(2^120)) / (log_2(4)) = 120 / 2 = 60. Correct. \n\nSo with actual numbers, it checks out. Therefore, the answer is indeed 60. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 60. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{60}\n</think>"}
