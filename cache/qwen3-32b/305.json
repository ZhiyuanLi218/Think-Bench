The options are about whether it emits or absorbs a photon and whether the energy increases or decreases. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in atoms, electrons exist in quantized energy levels. The principal quantum number n represents these energy levels. Higher n means the electron is in a higher energy state, farther from the nucleus. When an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower one, it releases energy. Since energy is conserved, this energy is emitted as a photon. So, if the hydrogen atom goes from n=3 to n=2, which is a lower energy level, the electron is moving down. Therefore, it should emit a photon.\n\nNow, what about the energy of the atom itself? The energy of the atom would decrease because the electron is in a lower energy state. The energy of the atom is related to the energy of the electron. When the electron drops to a lower energy level, the atom's total energy decreases. So the atom loses energy, which is carried away by the emitted photon.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption A says \"emits a photon, energy increases.\" Wait, if the atom emits a photon, it's losing energy, so the energy should decrease, not increase. So A is probably wrong.\n\nOption B is \"emits a photon, energy decreases.\" That seems correct based on my reasoning.\n\nOption C is \"absorbs a photon, energy increases.\" But absorption would happen if the electron is moving to a higher energy level. Since here it's moving from 3 to 2, which is lower, absorption isn't involved. So C is out.\n\nOption D is \"absorbs a photon, energy decreases.\" That doesn't make sense because absorbing a photon would add energy to the atom, so the energy should increase, not decrease. So D is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Let me just verify with the formula for energy levels in hydrogen. The energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=3, E_3 = -13.6 / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV. For n=2, E_2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV. The energy difference is E_3 - E_2 = (-1.51) - (-3.4) = 1.89 eV. Since the electron is moving from higher (less negative) to lower (more negative) energy, the atom loses energy. The energy lost is emitted as a photon. So yes, the atom's energy decreases, and a photon is emitted. Therefore, option B is correct.\n</think>"}
