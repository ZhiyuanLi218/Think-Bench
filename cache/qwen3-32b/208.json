This is a fundamental property of vector addition, where both **magnitude** and **direction** play crucial roles.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Concept\n\nVectors are quantities defined by both **magnitude** (size) and **direction**. Vector addition is not simply the addition of magnitudes, but a geometric combination that accounts for the direction of each vector.\n\nThe **zero vector** is a vector with zero magnitude, and it has no specific direction. To get the zero vector as a result of adding two vectors, the second vector must be the **negative** of the first. That is, if vector **A** is added to vector **B**, and the result is the zero vector (**A + B = 0**), then **B = -A**.\n\n---\n\n### Implications of This Relationship\n\nIf **B = -A**, then:\n- The **magnitude** of **B** is equal to the magnitude of **A**.\n- The **direction** of **B** is exactly opposite to that of **A**.\n\nThis ensures that the two vectors cancel each other out when added. For example:\n- If **A** is a 5-unit vector pointing east, then **B** must be a 5-unit vector pointing west.\n- Adding these together results in no net displacement: **A + B = 0**.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's now evaluate the answer choices in light of the above reasoning:\n\n- **A: They have equal magnitude and are pointed in the same direction.**  \n  ❌ Incorrect. If both vectors have the same magnitude and direction, their sum would be a vector with **double** the magnitude in that direction, not zero.\n\n- **B: They have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions.**  \n  ✅ **Correct.** This is exactly the condition that ensures the vectors cancel each other out and sum to zero.\n\n- **C: They have different magnitudes and are pointed in opposite directions.**  \n  ❌ Incorrect. If the magnitudes differ, the resultant vector will not be zero, but instead will point in the direction of the larger magnitude vector.\n\n- **D: It is not possible for the sum of two non-zero vectors to be zero.**  \n  ❌ Incorrect. As shown above, it is indeed possible if the vectors have equal magnitude and opposite directions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about vectors. The question is: If two non-zero vectors are added together, and the resultant vector is zero, what must be true of the two vectors? The options are A, B, C, or D. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what vectors are. Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction. So, when you add vectors, you can't just add their magnitudes like regular numbers; you have to consider their directions too. For example, if you walk 3 meters east and then 4 meters north, your total displacement isn't 7 meters in some direction, but rather the resultant vector would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides 3 and 4. But in this question, the resultant vector is zero. That means when you add the two vectors, you end up right back where you started. \n\nSo, if two vectors add up to zero, that means they are effectively canceling each other out. Let me visualize this. Suppose I have a vector A pointing in some direction, and another vector B. If adding A and B gives zero, then B must be the negative of A. Because A + (-A) = 0. So, vector B is the same as vector A but in the opposite direction. \n\nNow, for two vectors to be negatives of each other, they must have the same magnitude but opposite directions. Let me check that. If vector A has magnitude 5 units east, then vector -A would have magnitude 5 units west. Adding them together would result in zero displacement. So, their magnitudes are equal, and directions are opposite. \n\nLooking at the answer options, option B says \"They have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions.\" That seems to fit. Let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A says \"They have equal magnitude and are pointed in the same direction.\" If two vectors have the same direction and magnitude, adding them would result in a vector with double the magnitude in the same direction. So, that can't be zero. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption C says \"They have different magnitudes and are pointed in opposite directions.\" If they are in opposite directions but different magnitudes, then their sum would be a vector in the direction of the larger magnitude. For example, if one is 5 units east and the other is 3 units west, the resultant would be 2 units east. Not zero. So C is also incorrect.\n\nOption D says \"It is not possible for the sum of two non-zero vectors to be zero.\" But we just saw that if two vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, their sum is zero. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Let me just think again if there's any case where two vectors with equal magnitude and opposite direction might not sum to zero. Suppose they are in 3D space, but even then, if they are exact negatives, their sum is zero. So regardless of the coordinate system or dimensions, as long as they are exact negatives, the sum is zero. \n\nAnother way to think about vector addition is using the parallelogram law. If two vectors are added, the resultant is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by them. For the resultant to be zero, the two vectors must form a straight line when placed tip to tail, but pointing in opposite directions. So, again, same magnitude, opposite direction.\n\nAlternatively, using vector notation: Let vector A = (a1, a2, a3) and vector B = (b1, b2, b3). For A + B = 0, then each component must satisfy a1 + b1 = 0, a2 + b2 = 0, a3 + b3 = 0. Therefore, b1 = -a1, b2 = -a2, b3 = -a3. So vector B is -A. Therefore, magnitude of B is sqrt( (-a1)^2 + (-a2)^2 + (-a3)^2 ) = sqrt(a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2) which is same as magnitude of A. Hence, equal magnitude, opposite direction. \n\nSo all the mathematical reasoning also leads to option B. Therefore, I can be confident that the correct answer is B.\n</think>"}
