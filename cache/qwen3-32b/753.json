The question is asking what momentum a photon needs to have so that when the molecule is in its fundamental state, it can absorb the photon and transition to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different momentum values. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the quantum rotation-vibration model entails. Diatomic molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The energy levels for vibrations are quantized and can be approximated by the harmonic oscillator model, while the rotational energy levels are quantized according to the rigid rotor model. However, the problem mentions a non-rigid rotor model, which I think accounts for the fact that molecules aren't perfectly rigid and experience centrifugal distortion at higher rotational energies. But maybe for the lowest energy transitions, the rigid rotor approximation is sufficient?\n\nThe molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state for a diatomic molecule would be the lowest vibrational and rotational state. So, in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). When it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher energy state. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, what's the lowest possible energy transition?\n\nIn molecular spectroscopy, there are two main types of transitions: vibrational and rotational. The vibrational transitions involve changes in the vibrational quantum number v, while rotational transitions involve changes in the rotational quantum number J. The energy difference for a vibrational transition is typically much larger than that for a rotational transition. However, the question is about the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" So, if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible states would be either:\n\n1. The first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0)\n2. The first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1)\n\nBut we need to figure out which of these two has a lower energy. Since vibrational transitions have energy differences on the order of ħω, and rotational transitions have energy differences on the order of B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. Let's compare these two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the vibrational energy difference. The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 would have an energy difference of ΔE_vib = ħω.\n\nFor the rotational energy levels, the rigid rotor model gives E_rot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia of the molecule. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule, and R is the bond length.\n\nSo, for the transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference would be ΔE_rot = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B [1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = 2B.\n\nTherefore, we need to compare ħω (vibrational transition) and 2B (rotational transition). Which one is smaller?\n\nGiven that the problem gives us the angular frequency of vibration ω = 4×10¹⁴ rad/s, and we need to calculate B.\n\nSo let's compute B. First, compute the reduced mass μ.\n\nThe masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The reduced mass μ is given by:\n\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n\nBut we need to convert amu to kilograms. 1 amu ≈ 1.66054×10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\nSo,\n\nMx = 20 * 1.66054×10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.32108×10⁻²⁶ kg\n\nMy = 2 * 1.66054×10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.32108×10⁻²⁷ kg\n\nTherefore, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = [ (3.32108×10⁻²⁶ kg)(3.32108×10⁻²⁷ kg) ] / [3.32108×10⁻²⁶ kg + 3.32108×10⁻²⁷ kg]\n\nLet me compute the denominator first:\n\nMx + My = 3.32108×10⁻²⁶ + 3.32108×10⁻²⁷ = 3.32108×10⁻²⁶ + 0.332108×10⁻²⁶ = 3.653188×10⁻²⁶ kg\n\nNumerator:\n\n(3.32108×10⁻²⁶)(3.32108×10⁻²⁷) = (3.32108)^2 × 10⁻⁵³\n\nCalculating 3.32108 squared:\n\nApproximately, 3.32108² ≈ 11.03 (since 3.3² = 10.89, and a bit more). Let me compute more accurately:\n\n3.32108 × 3.32108:\n\nFirst compute 3.32108 × 3.32108:\n\nLet me approximate this as (3.3 + 0.02108)^2 = 3.3² + 2*3.3*0.02108 + 0.02108² ≈ 10.89 + 0.139 + 0.00044 ≈ 10.89 + 0.139 = 11.029 + 0.00044 ≈ 11.0294. So approximately 11.03 × 10⁻⁵³ kg²? Wait, no, the units are kg²? Wait, the numerator is in kg²?\n\nWait, the reduced mass μ has units of kg. The numerator is Mx * My in kg², and the denominator is Mx + My in kg, so μ is in kg.\n\nSo the numerator is approximately 11.03 × 10⁻⁵³ kg², and the denominator is 3.653188×10⁻²⁶ kg.\n\nTherefore, μ ≈ 11.03 × 10⁻⁵³ / 3.653188×10⁻²⁶ ≈ (11.03 / 3.653188) × 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ let me calculate 11.03 / 3.653.\n\nWell, 3.653 * 3 = 10.959. So 3.653 * 3 ≈ 10.959, which is very close to 11.03. Therefore, 11.03 / 3.653 ≈ 3.02. So approximately 3.02 × 10⁻²⁷ kg. Let me check with more precise numbers:\n\nLet me compute 11.03 / 3.653188.\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps:\n\nFirst, 3.653188 × 3 = 10.959564\n\nSubtract this from 11.03: 11.03 - 10.959564 = 0.070436.\n\nSo that's 3 + 0.070436 / 3.653188 ≈ 3 + 0.0193 ≈ 3.0193. So approximately 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg. Let's say approximately 3.02 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\nSo μ ≈ 3.02 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\nNow, the bond length R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m, so R = 2×10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\nTherefore, the moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.02×10⁻²⁷ kg * (2×10⁻¹⁰ m)^2 = 3.02×10⁻²⁷ * 4×10⁻²⁰ = 12.08×10⁻⁴⁷ kg·m² ≈ 1.208×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n\nNow, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ² / (2I). Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. ħ ≈ 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nSo, ħ² ≈ (1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s².\n\nThen, 2I = 2 * 1.208×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m² ≈ 2.416×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n\nTherefore, B ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2.416×10⁻⁴⁶ ≈ let's compute that.\n\nDividing 1.112 / 2.416 ≈ 0.46, and then the exponent is 10^(-68 + 46) = 10⁻²². Therefore, B ≈ 0.46 × 10⁻²² J.\n\nWait, but units of B? The rotational constant B has units of energy (Joules). However, in spectroscopy, B is often expressed in units of cm⁻¹ or in terms of frequency. But let me confirm the calculation.\n\nYes, B is energy. So the energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. So let's compute 2B ≈ 0.92 × 10⁻²² J.\n\nNow, let's compute the vibrational energy difference ħω. Given ω = 4×10¹⁴ rad/s.\n\nħω ≈ 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ J·s * 4×10¹⁴ rad/s = 4.218×10⁻²⁰ J.\n\nSo comparing the two:\n\nΔE_rot ≈ 0.92×10⁻²² J\n\nΔE_vib ≈ 4.218×10⁻²⁰ J\n\nClearly, the rotational energy difference is much smaller than the vibrational one. Therefore, the next lowest energy state is the first rotational excited state (J=1, v=0), not the first vibrational excited state. Therefore, the photon must have energy equal to ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 0.92×10⁻²² J.\n\nBut the question asks for the momentum of the photon. The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by E_photon = pc, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light. Therefore, p = E_photon / c.\n\nSo, let's compute p = (0.92×10⁻²² J) / (3×10⁸ m/s) ≈ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s? Wait, that seems extremely small. But let me check my calculations again because the answer options are on the order of 10⁻²⁷ to 10⁻²⁸ N·s (which is equivalent to kg·m/s). So there must be a mistake here. Let me retrace my steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B? Let me check again.\n\nFirst, the calculation of μ:\n\nMx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66×10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.32×10⁻²⁶ kg\n\nMy = 2 amu = 3.32×10⁻²⁷ kg\n\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.32×10⁻²⁶ * 3.32×10⁻²⁷) / (3.32×10⁻²⁶ + 3.32×10⁻²⁷)\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator again.\n\nNumerator: 3.32×10⁻²⁶ * 3.32×10⁻²⁷ = (3.32)^2 × 10⁻⁵³ ≈ 11.0 × 10⁻⁵³ kg².\n\nDenominator: 3.32×10⁻²⁶ + 0.332×10⁻²⁶ = 3.652×10⁻²⁶ kg.\n\nTherefore, μ ≈ 11.0×10⁻⁵³ / 3.652×10⁻²⁶ ≈ (11.0 / 3.652) × 10⁻²⁷ ≈ 3.01 × 10⁻²⁷ kg. That seems correct.\n\nI = μ R² = 3.01×10⁻²⁷ kg * (2×10⁻¹⁰ m)^2 = 3.01×10⁻²⁷ * 4×10⁻²⁰ = 1.204×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m². Correct.\n\nB = ħ² / (2I). Let me compute ħ²:\n\nħ ≈ 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nħ² ≈ (1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s².\n\nDivide by 2I:\n\n2I = 2 * 1.204×10⁻⁴⁶ ≈ 2.408×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n\nSo B ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2.408×10⁻⁴⁶ ≈ 4.618×10⁻²³ J. Wait, previously I had 0.46×10⁻²², but here it's 4.6×10⁻²³ J. Which is the same as 0.46×10⁻²² J. So that's correct.\n\nThen, ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9.24×10⁻²³ J. Wait, earlier I said 0.92×10⁻²², which is the same as 9.2×10⁻²³ J. Correct.\n\nThen, ħω = 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ * 4×10¹⁴ ≈ 4.218×10⁻²⁰ J. Correct.\n\nSo the rotational energy is indeed much smaller. Therefore, the photon must have energy equal to 9.2×10⁻²³ J. Then, p = E / c = 9.2×10⁻²³ J / 3×10⁸ m/s ≈ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s? But the answer options are in the range of 10⁻²⁸ to 10⁻²⁷ N·s (which is kg·m/s). There's a discrepancy here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B? Let me check the formula again. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J(J+1). For J=0 to J=1, the difference is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B*(1*2 - 0) = 2B. So that part is correct.\n\nBut maybe the value of B is wrong? Let me recalculate B.\n\nB = ħ²/(2I). Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, I = 1.204×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n\nħ² = (1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s². Wait, but J is kg·m²/s². So J²·s² is (kg²·m⁴/s⁴)·s² = kg²·m⁴/s².\n\nBut 2I is kg·m². Therefore, B has units of (kg²·m⁴/s²) / (kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s² = J. Correct. So the units are correct.\n\nBut let me compute B numerically again:\n\nB = (1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 / (2 * 1.204×10⁻⁴⁶)\n\nFirst compute numerator:\n\n(1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²? Wait, no, actually, ħ has units of J·s, so ħ² has units of J²·s². Divided by 2I (kg·m²), which gives J²·s² / (kg·m²). But J is kg·m²/s², so substituting:\n\nJ²·s² / (kg·m²) = (kg²·m⁴/s⁴)·s² / (kg·m²) ) = kg·m² / s² = J. Correct. So the units are correct.\n\nBut let me compute the numerical value again:\n\nNumerator: 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ (J²·s²?)\n\nWait, no, actually, let me think in terms of numbers:\n\nħ² = (1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ (J·s)^2\n\nDenominator: 2I = 2.408×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nSo B = 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2.408×10⁻⁴⁶ ≈ 4.618×10⁻²³ J. Correct. Therefore, ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9.24×10⁻²³ J.\n\nBut then, converting that to photon momentum p = E / c = 9.24×10⁻²³ J / 3×10⁸ m/s ≈ 3.08×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s. But the answer options are way higher, like 1.1×10⁻²⁷ N·s. This suggests that my calculation is wrong. There must be a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of I?\n\nWait, I = μ R². μ was calculated as approx 3.01×10⁻²⁷ kg. R is 2×10⁻¹⁰ m. Therefore, R² is 4×10⁻²⁰ m². Therefore, I = 3.01×10⁻²⁷ kg * 4×10⁻²⁰ m² = 1.204×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m². Correct. So that's right.\n\nWait, but maybe the formula for B is different? In some references, the rotational constant is given in terms of frequency, or wavenumbers. Let me recall:\n\nIn spectroscopy, the rotational constant B is often expressed in cm⁻¹, and is given by B = h/(8π²I c), where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. But here, if we want the energy in terms of J, then B = ħ²/(2I). Let me check that.\n\nYes, the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = B J(J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I). So that is correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct. But the problem is that the resulting momentum is way too small compared to the answer options. So what's wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not about a rotational transition but a vibrational one? But earlier calculation shows that vibrational transition energy is much higher. However, maybe there is another consideration. For example, in real molecules, there are selection rules. For a vibrational transition, the selection rule is Δv = ±1, and for rotational, ΔJ = ±1. However, in reality, rotational and vibrational transitions can occur simultaneously, leading to rovibrational transitions. But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next lowest energy state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Since ΔE_rot is smaller, the photon would need to have energy corresponding to the rotational transition. But according to my calculation, the momentum is 3×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s, but the options are 10⁻²⁸ to 10⁻²⁷. That's a factor of 1000 difference. What's going on?\n\nWait, let me check if I used the correct value of ħ. ħ is approximately 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ J·s. Correct. c is 3×10⁸ m/s. Correct.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the photon momentum. E_photon = 9.24×10⁻²³ J. Then p = E / c = 9.24×10⁻²³ / 3×10⁸ ≈ 3.08×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s. That's 3.08×10⁻³¹ N·s. The answer options are way higher. So something is wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B?\n\nLet me recalculate B step by step again.\n\nFirst, compute I:\n\nI = μ R².\n\nμ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nGiven Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.\n\nμ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.\n\nWait! Oh! I think I made a mistake here earlier. The reduced mass is μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). In amu units, it's (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Earlier, I converted Mx and My to kg and calculated μ ≈ 3.02×10⁻²⁷ kg. But if μ is 1.818 amu, then converting that to kg:\n\n1.818 amu * 1.66054×10⁻²⁷ kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.66054×10⁻²⁷ ≈ let's compute that.\n\n1.818 * 1.66054 ≈ Let's calculate:\n\nFirst, 1 * 1.66054 = 1.66054\n\n0.8 * 1.66054 = 1.32843\n\n0.018 * 1.66054 ≈ 0.02989\n\nAdding up: 1.66054 + 1.32843 ≈ 2.98897 + 0.02989 ≈ 3.01886. Therefore, μ ≈ 3.01886×10⁻²⁷ kg. Which matches my previous calculation. So that's correct.\n\nSo I = μ R² = 3.01886×10⁻²⁷ kg * (2×10⁻¹⁰ m)^2 = 3.01886×10⁻²⁷ * 4×10⁻²⁰ = 1.2075×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m². Correct.\n\nThen B = ħ²/(2I) ≈ (1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 / (2 * 1.2075×10⁻⁴⁶)\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²?\n\nWait, no, ħ is in J·s, so ħ² is in J²·s². Divided by 2I (kg·m²). Let me compute the numerical value:\n\nNumerator: 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ (J²·s²)\n\nDenominator: 2.415×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nBut J is kg·m²/s², so J²·s² = (kg²·m⁴/s⁴)·s² = kg²·m⁴/s². Divided by kg·m² gives kg·m²/s² = J. Correct.\n\nSo B ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2.415×10⁻⁴⁶ ≈ 4.604×10⁻²³ J. So ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9.208×10⁻²³ J. Correct.\n\nThen, p = E / c ≈ 9.208×10⁻²³ / 3×10⁸ ≈ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s. But the answer options are in the range of 1e-28 to 1e-27. This is three orders of magnitude smaller. What's going on?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not about a rotational transition but a vibrational one? Let me check the vibrational energy again.\n\nΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ * 4×10¹⁴ ≈ 4.218×10⁻²⁰ J.\n\nThen p = E / c ≈ 4.218×10⁻²⁰ / 3×10⁸ ≈ 1.406×10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s. Which is option A: 1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s. That matches option A. But earlier I thought the rotational transition was lower in energy, but according to this, the vibrational transition would require a photon with momentum 1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s (option A), and the rotational transition would require 3.07×10⁻³¹ N·s, which is not among the options. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, why is there a discrepancy? Earlier I thought that rotational transitions have lower energy than vibrational ones, but according to numbers, for this particular molecule, the vibrational energy difference is much larger than the rotational one. But according to my calculation, the vibrational energy difference is 4.2×10⁻²⁰ J, and the rotational is 9.2×10⁻²³ J. So rotational is smaller. Therefore, the next lowest energy state is rotational. But the corresponding photon momentum is not in the options. However, option A is 1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. So why is this?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the assumption that the next lowest energy state is rotational. Maybe there are other states? For example, in reality, the vibrational and rotational levels are not independent, and there are also vibrational-rotational transitions. However, the question says \"the next state with the lowest possible energy.\" If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), then the next possible states are:\n\n1. (v=1, J=0) with energy ΔE_vib = ħω ≈ 4.2×10⁻²⁰ J.\n\n2. (v=0, J=1) with energy ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2×10⁻²³ J.\n\nBut according to these numbers, the rotational transition is lower. But the answer options suggest that the correct answer is A (which corresponds to the vibrational transition). This suggests that either my calculation is wrong, or there's another consideration.\n\nWait, maybe the question is considering the non-rigid rotor model? The problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for centrifugal distortion. However, for the lowest rotational state, the correction might be negligible. So I think my calculation is still valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the next vibrational state but with some rotational excitation? For example, in reality, when a molecule undergoes a vibrational transition, it often also changes its rotational state. However, the question specifies \"the next state with the lowest possible energy.\" If the molecule is in v=0, J=0, then the lowest energy transition would be to v=0, J=1 (rotational) since it requires less energy than v=1, J=0 (vibrational). But according to the options given, the answer is A which corresponds to the vibrational transition. This suggests that there's an error in my calculation.\n\nLet me check the calculation of ΔE_rot again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.\n\nLet me recalculate B:\n\nB = ħ² / (2I)\n\nħ = 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nI = 1.2075×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nSo:\n\nħ² = (1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²\n\n2I = 2.415×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nB = 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2.415×10⁻⁴⁶ ≈ 4.604×10⁻²³ J\n\nΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9.208×10⁻²³ J.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then p = 9.208×10⁻²³ / 3×10⁸ ≈ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s. This is way smaller than the given options. So why is option A (1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s) present? It corresponds to the vibrational transition. Maybe the question is not about a rotational transition but a vibrational one? But why?\n\nWait, the question says \"the next state with the lowest possible energy.\" If the rotational transition is lower, why isn't that the answer? Perhaps there's a selection rule that forbids the rotational transition? For example, in order for a transition to be allowed, the molecule must have a permanent dipole moment, and the transition must satisfy ΔJ = ±1 for rotational transitions. But the question doesn't specify whether the molecule is polar or not. However, diatomic molecules with different atoms (X and Y) likely have a permanent dipole moment, so rotational transitions should be allowed. Therefore, the answer should be the rotational transition, but the corresponding momentum is not among the options. This suggests that there is a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass? Let me recalculate μ.\n\nGiven Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.\n\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.\n\nConvert to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66054×10⁻²⁷ kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.66054×10⁻²⁷.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately:\n\n1.818 * 1.66054 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.818 * 1.66054:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n1 * 1.66054 = 1.66054\n\n0.8 * 1.66054 = 1.328432\n\n0.018 * 1.66054 = 0.02988972\n\nAdding them together: 1.66054 + 1.328432 = 2.988972 + 0.02988972 ≈ 3.01886172.\n\nSo μ ≈ 3.01886172×10⁻²⁷ kg. Correct.\n\nThen I = μ R² = 3.01886×10⁻²⁷ kg * (2×10⁻¹⁰ m)^2 = 3.01886×10⁻²⁷ * 4×10⁻²⁰ = 1.20754×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m². Correct.\n\nB = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718×10⁻³⁴)^2 / (2 * 1.20754×10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ 1.112×10⁻⁶⁸ / 2.415×10⁻⁴⁶ ≈ 4.604×10⁻²³ J. Correct.\n\nΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9.208×10⁻²³ J. Correct.\n\np = E/c ≈ 9.208×10⁻²³ / 3×10⁸ ≈ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA: 1.4×10⁻²⁸\n\nB: 1.9×10⁻²⁸\n\nC: 1.1×10⁻²⁷\n\nD: 2.3×10⁻²⁷\n\nNone of these match. But option A is 1.4×10⁻²⁸, which is the momentum for the vibrational transition. Let me check that again.\n\nFor the vibrational transition, ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718×10⁻³⁴ * 4×10¹⁴ = 4.218×10⁻²⁰ J.\n\np = 4.218×10⁻²⁰ / 3×10⁸ ≈ 1.406×10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s, which is option A. So why is this not the rotational transition?\n\nIs it possible that the question is asking about the next vibrational state instead of rotational? The wording is: \"the next state with the lowest possible energy.\" If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible states are v=1, J=0 and v=0, J=1. Since ΔE_rot < ΔE_vib, the next lowest energy state is v=0, J=1. But the corresponding photon momentum is not among the options. However, the vibrational transition is in the options. This suggests that perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the question, or perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to the next vibrational-rotational state? For example, in reality, when a molecule undergoes a vibrational transition, it often also changes its rotational state. The lowest energy rovibrational transition would be from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=±1). The energy difference would be ΔE = ħω + B(1(1+1) - 0(0+1)) = ħω + 2B. But this would be higher than the pure vibrational transition. Alternatively, the lowest energy transition might be from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which is just the vibrational transition. But why is the rotational transition not considered?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the rotational transition is not allowed? For example, if the molecule is non-polar, then rotational transitions are not allowed. But since it's a diatomic molecule with different atoms (X and Y), it should be polar. Hence, rotational transitions are allowed.\n\nWait, another possibility: the question is asking about the non-rigid rotor model, which might have different energy levels. The non-rigid rotor accounts for centrifugal distortion, which adds a term to the rotational energy. The energy levels are given by E = B J(J+1) - D J²(J+1)², where D is the centrifugal distortion constant. However, for low J values, this correction is small. For J=1, the correction would be negligible, so the energy difference would still be approximately 2B. Hence, my calculation should still hold.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is not about a pure rotational transition but about a combination of vibration and rotation? For example, in some cases, the lowest energy transition might involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But the lowest energy would still be the pure rotational one.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent of the energy.\n\nΔE_rot = 9.2×10⁻²³ J. Let me convert this to eV to get a better sense. 1 eV = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ J. So ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2×10⁻²³ / 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ ≈ 5.74×10⁻⁴ eV ≈ 0.000574 eV.\n\nThe vibrational energy is ΔE_vib ≈ 4.2×10⁻²⁰ J / 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ J/eV ≈ 0.262 eV.\n\nSo the rotational transition is about 0.00057 eV, and the vibrational is about 0.26 eV. So the rotational is much smaller. Hence, the photon required for the rotational transition has much lower energy. But the options given don't include this value. The options correspond to energies:\n\nFor option A: p = 1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s. Energy E = pc = 1.4×10⁻²⁸ * 3×10⁸ = 4.2×10⁻²⁰ J, which is the vibrational energy. This matches.\n\nFor the rotational transition, the energy is 9.2×10⁻²³ J, which corresponds to p = 3.07×10⁻³¹ N·s. This is not among the options. Hence, there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about a pure rotational transition but about a vibrational transition? Maybe the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" refers to the next vibrational state? But why? If the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next lowest energy state would be the first rotational state, not the first vibrational state. Unless there is some other factor.\n\nWait, maybe the question is using a different model? The problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model or non-rigid rotor model. Maybe in this model, the lowest energy transition is vibrational? No, the non-rigid rotor model is for rotational states.\n\nWait, another possibility: the question is asking about the transition from the fundamental state to the first excited state, which includes both vibration and rotation. But the first excited state would be the lowest of all possible excited states. Since the rotational transition is lower, it should be that.\n\nBut the answer options don't include the rotational transition. This suggests that either the question is incorrect, or there is a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me try to calculate the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers or frequency, to see if there is a different way to express it.\n\nIn spectroscopy, the rotational constant B is often expressed in cm⁻¹, and is given by B = h/(8π²I c). Let's try this.\n\nB = (6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (8 * π² * I * 3×10⁸ m/s).\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute denominator: 8 * π² * I * c.\n\nI = 1.2075×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nc = 3×10⁸ m/s\n\nSo denominator = 8 * π² * 1.2075×10⁻⁴⁶ * 3×10⁸ ≈ 8 * 9.8696 * 1.2075×10⁻⁴⁶ * 3×10⁸ ≈ 8 * 9.8696 * 3.6225×10⁻³⁸ ≈ 8 * 9.8696 * 3.6225×10⁻³⁸.\n\nFirst compute 9.8696 * 3.6225 ≈ 35.7.\n\nThen multiply by 8: 35.7 * 8 ≈ 285.6.\n\nSo denominator ≈ 285.6×10⁻³⁸ = 2.856×10⁻³⁶.\n\nThen B = 6.626×10⁻³⁴ / 2.856×10⁻³⁶ ≈ 232 J·s/(m·s) ? Wait, no, units? Let me see:\n\nThe units of B in this case would be cm⁻¹. Let me check the calculation.\n\nActually, the formula B (in cm⁻¹) = h/(8π²Ic). Let me compute the numerical value.\n\nBut maybe this is not helpful for finding the energy. Let me instead calculate the frequency corresponding to the rotational transition.\n\nThe energy ΔE_rot = 9.2×10⁻²³ J. The frequency ν = ΔE / h = 9.2×10⁻²³ / 6.626×10⁻³⁴ ≈ 1.39×10¹¹ Hz = 139 GHz. This is in the microwave region, which is typical for rotational transitions.\n\nThe photon momentum p = hν/c = (h/c) * ν = λ / (2π) * ν = hν/c, which is what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut the answer options suggest that the correct answer is A, which corresponds to a vibrational transition. This is in the infrared region (0.26 eV is about 1.24 microns, which is infrared).\n\nGiven that the options do not include the rotational transition, but do include the vibrational one, perhaps there is a mistake in the question, or perhaps I misunderstood what is meant by \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\"\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy is the first vibrational state, but with some rotational excitation? For example, the lowest energy rovibrational transition. But the lowest energy would still be the pure rotational transition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the next vibrational state, assuming that the rotational state remains at J=0. In that case, the energy is ħω, and the photon momentum is option A. Since the options include this, and the rotational transition is not among them, maybe the question assumes that only vibrational transitions are considered? Or perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed for some reason.\n\nWait, selection rules: for a pure rotational transition, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For a vibrational transition, Δv = ±1. If the molecule is in v=0, J=0, then a photon can induce a transition to v=1, J=0 (Δv=+1, ΔJ=0), or to v=0, J=1 (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1). But is the ΔJ=0 transition allowed? For a vibrational transition, usually, there is also a change in rotational state, but a pure vibrational transition (ΔJ=0) is allowed if the dipole moment change is along the axis of the molecule. For diatomic molecules, the selection rule for vibrational transitions is Δv = ±1, and for rotational, ΔJ = ±1, 0? Wait, no, for vibrational-rotational transitions, the selection rules are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1, 0? Or is ΔJ = ±1?\n\nActually, in rovibrational transitions, the selection rules are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. A transition with ΔJ = 0 is not allowed. Therefore, a pure vibrational transition (ΔJ=0) is not allowed. Hence, the allowed transitions from v=0, J=0 would be to v=1, J=±1. Hence, the energy difference would be ΔE = ħω + B[J_f(J_f+1) - J_i(J_i+1)].\n\nFor the lowest energy transition, we want the smallest ΔE. Starting from J=0, the allowed ΔJ is ±1, so J=+1 or -1. Since J is a non-negative integer, it goes to J=1. So the energy is:\n\nΔE = ħω + B[1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = ħω + 2B.\n\nBut this is higher than the pure vibrational transition without changing J, but since that transition is not allowed, the lowest allowed transition would be this one. However, this energy is higher than the pure rotational transition (which is allowed). Therefore, if both rotational and rovibrational transitions are allowed, the lowest energy transition is the pure rotational one.\n\nBut if the question assumes that only vibrational transitions are considered (which is not the case), then the answer would be the vibrational transition. However, given that the rotational transition is allowed and has lower energy, the answer should be the rotational one, but it's not among the options. This suggests that either the question is flawed, or there is a different interpretation.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"the next state with the lowest possible energy.\" If the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0, then the next lowest energy state is v=0, J=1. If this is allowed, then the photon must have energy ΔE_rot. But since this is not among the options, perhaps the question assumes that the transition is from v=0 to v=1, ignoring rotational changes? But that would be incorrect due to selection rules. However, if the question is from a textbook or course where they simplify and assume ΔJ=0 is allowed, then the answer would be the vibrational transition.\n\nGiven that the options include the vibrational transition (option A), and the rotational one is not there, perhaps the question expects the vibrational transition. Maybe the question is not considering rotational transitions, or there is a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next vibrational state, but the wording is ambiguous. If \"next state\" refers to the next vibrational state, then it's v=1, J=0, and the answer is A. If it refers to the next overall state (including rotational), it's the rotational one, which isn't an option. Given that the options include A, and the calculation for the vibrational transition gives p=1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s, which is option A, I think that the intended answer is A, and the question assumes that the transition is vibrational, possibly ignoring rotational effects or assuming ΔJ=0 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, despite the earlier detailed calculation suggesting the rotational transition is lower, the answer expected here is A, corresponding to the vibrational transition. This might be due to the question's context or simplifications in the model it refers to.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: p = 1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n</think>"}
