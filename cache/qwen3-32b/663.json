Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\n\n\"Diameter AB of a circle has length a 2-digit integer (base ten). Reversing the digits gives the length of the perpendicular chord CD. The distance from their intersection point H to the center O is a positive rational number. Determine the length of AB.\"\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There's a circle with diameter AB. Since AB is a diameter, its length is a two-digit integer. Let me denote the length of AB as 10a + b, where a and b are digits from 1 to 9 (since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero). Then, reversing the digits gives the length of chord CD, which would be 10b + a. \n\nNow, CD is a chord perpendicular to AB, and they intersect at point H. The distance from H to the center O is a positive rational number. I need to find AB's length.\n\nLet me recall some circle theorems. If two chords intersect in a circle, then the products of the segments of each chord are equal. But in this case, CD is perpendicular to AB. Also, since AB is a diameter, maybe there are some properties specific to that.\n\nLet me try to draw a diagram mentally. AB is a horizontal diameter. CD is a vertical chord intersecting AB at point H. Since CD is perpendicular to AB and AB is a diameter, then by the perpendicular chord bisector theorem, AB bisects CD. Wait, but CD is not necessarily a diameter. However, since AB is a diameter and CD is perpendicular to AB, then AB does bisect CD. Therefore, H is the midpoint of CD. \n\nBut H is not necessarily the center O unless CD is also a diameter. Since CD's length is different from AB's length (unless the digits are the same, which they aren't because reversing digits would give same number only if a = b, but AB is a two-digit number, so if a = b, then reversing digits would be same, but then CD would be same as AB. But since CD is a chord, not necessarily a diameter. However, if AB is diameter and CD is perpendicular to AB at center, then CD would be another diameter. But since AB and CD have different lengths (unless digits are same), so H is not the center. Therefore, H is some point along AB where CD intersects AB perpendicularly, and H is midpoint of CD.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let me denote AB = 2R, since AB is a diameter. Wait, but AB is given as a two-digit integer. Let me denote AB = L, which is 10a + b, so L is the diameter. Therefore, the radius R = L / 2.\n\nCD is a chord of length M = 10b + a, which is perpendicular to AB at point H. The distance from H to the center O is h, which is a rational number. Need to find L.\n\nLet me set up coordinate system. Let me place the center O at (0, 0). Then AB is the horizontal diameter from (-R, 0) to (R, 0). Let me assume that CD intersects AB at point H, which is somewhere along AB. Let me denote the coordinates of H as (h, 0), but wait, since the distance from H to O is h? Wait, the problem says the distance from H to O is a positive rational number. Wait, if O is at (0, 0) and H is at (x, 0), then the distance HO is |x|. Therefore, if I set up coordinates with AB along x-axis, center at origin, then H is at some point (d, 0), where d is the distance from O to H. Since H is between A and B, d is between -R and R, but since distance is positive, maybe take absolute value. However, since AB is diameter, and CD is perpendicular chord intersecting AB at H, which can be on either side of O, but since length is positive, maybe we can assume d is positive. So let me define HO = d, a rational number. So coordinates of H is (d, 0) or (-d, 0). But since AB is from -R to R, and CD is perpendicular, let me assume H is (d, 0), with 0 ≤ d < R.\n\nSince CD is perpendicular to AB at H, and CD has length M = 10b + a. Since H is midpoint of CD, the coordinates of C and D can be written as (d, e) and (d, -e), so that the distance between C and D is 2e = M, so e = M / 2. But since C and D lie on the circle, their coordinates must satisfy the circle equation x² + y² = R².\n\nSo plugging in point C (d, e):\n\nd² + e² = R²\n\nBut e = M / 2, so:\n\nd² + (M / 2)² = R²\n\nBut R = AB / 2 = L / 2. Therefore:\n\nd² + (M²) / 4 = (L²) / 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4d² + M² = L²\n\nTherefore:\n\n4d² = L² - M²\n\nWhich is:\n\n4d² = (L - M)(L + M)\n\nBut L and M are two-digit numbers where M is the reverse of L's digits. Let me denote L as 10a + b and M as 10b + a. Therefore:\n\nL - M = (10a + b) - (10b + a) = 9a - 9b = 9(a - b)\n\nSimilarly, L + M = (10a + b) + (10b + a) = 11a + 11b = 11(a + b)\n\nTherefore:\n\n4d² = 9(a - b) * 11(a + b) = 99(a - b)(a + b)\n\nTherefore:\n\nd² = (99 / 4)(a - b)(a + b)\n\nBut d is rational, so d² must be rational. However, since a and b are digits (integers from 0-9, with a ≥ 1 since L is two-digit), (a - b)(a + b) is integer, so d² is rational. However, since d is a distance, it's a positive real number, but the problem says that d is a positive rational number. Therefore, d must be rational, so d² must be square of rational. Therefore, the expression (99 / 4)(a - b)(a + b) must be square of rational. Let me note that 99 / 4 is 9*11 / 4. Therefore, the entire expression is (9/4)*11*(a - b)(a + b). Therefore, for this to be square of rational, the product must be square of rational. Since 9/4 is square of 3/2, so we can write:\n\nd² = (3/2)^2 * 11*(a - b)(a + b)\n\nTherefore, 11*(a - b)(a + b) must be square of rational. However, since (a - b)(a + b) is integer, 11*(a - b)(a + b) must be square of rational. But since 11 is prime, for this to be square of rational, the numerator and denominator must be squares. Since 11 is prime, the entire expression must be rational squared. Let me think. Let me denote that 11*(a - b)(a + b) must be a square times some factors. Since 11 is prime, unless (a - b)(a + b) contains another 11, the product will have an odd power of 11. Therefore, for 11*(a - b)(a + b) to be rational squared, it must be integer squared? Wait, because (a - b)(a + b) is integer, so 11*(a - b)(a + b) is integer. Since d² is rational squared, but since d is a length in the circle, which is real, but the problem says it's a positive rational number. Therefore, d is rational. Therefore, d² is square of rational. But since 11*(a - b)(a + b) is integer, and multiplied by 9/4, which is square of 3/2, then the entire expression is square of rational if and only if 11*(a - b)(a + b) is square of rational. However, since 11*(a - b)(a + b) is integer, then it must be square of rational, which implies it must be square of integer. Because if a rational squared is equal to integer, then that integer must be square of integer. For example, suppose p/q squared is integer, then p²/q² is integer, so q² divides p², so q divides p, so p/q is integer. Therefore, 11*(a - b)(a + b) must be a perfect square. Therefore, 11*(a - b)(a + b) is integer square.\n\nTherefore, 11 divides that square. Since 11 is prime, 11 divides (a - b)(a + b). Therefore, since 11 divides the product (a - b)(a + b), then 11 divides (a - b) or 11 divides (a + b). But a and b are digits from 0 to 9, with a ≥ 1. Therefore, a + b can be at most 9 + 9 = 18, so 11 divides a + b only if a + b = 11. Similarly, a - b can be from -8 to 9. Since 11 divides a - b, only possible if a - b = 0 or ±11. But since a and b are digits, a - b can't be ±11. Therefore, the only possibility is that a + b = 11. Therefore, 11 divides (a + b). Therefore, a + b = 11. Therefore, this is a key equation.\n\nTherefore, we have that a + b = 11. Therefore, going back, 11*(a - b)*(a + b) becomes 11*(a - b)*11 = 121*(a - b). Therefore, 121*(a - b) must be a perfect square. Since 121 is already 11², then (a - b) must be a perfect square. Therefore, a - b must be a perfect square. Let me note that.\n\nSo, given that a + b = 11 and a - b is a perfect square. Also, since AB is a two-digit number, a is from 1 to 9, and b is from 0 to 9. Since a + b = 11, b = 11 - a. Therefore, since b must be between 0 and 9, 11 - a must be between 0 and 9. Therefore, a must be between 2 and 11. But since a is a digit, a is between 2 and 9. Therefore, a ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and b = 11 - a ∈ {9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2}.\n\nNow, also, a - b must be a perfect square. Since b = 11 - a, then a - b = a - (11 - a) = 2a - 11. Therefore, 2a - 11 must be a perfect square. Let me denote k² = 2a - 11, where k is a positive integer (since a > b because 2a - 11 must be positive? Wait, not necessarily. Because a - b could be negative? Wait, but if a - b is negative, then 11*(a - b)*(a + b) would be negative, but since we have 121*(a - b) must be a perfect square. However, perfect squares are non-negative, so 121*(a - b) ≥ 0. Therefore, a - b ≥ 0. Therefore, 2a - 11 ≥ 0 => 2a ≥ 11 => a ≥ 5.5. Since a is integer, a ≥ 6. Therefore, a is from 6 to 9, since earlier a was from 2 to 9 but now restricted to a ≥ 6. Therefore, possible values for a are 6, 7, 8, 9. Let me check each case:\n\nCase 1: a = 6. Then b = 11 - 6 = 5. Then a - b = 1. 1 is a perfect square (1²). So that works. Then k² = 1, k = 1.\n\nCase 2: a = 7. Then b = 11 - 7 = 4. Then a - b = 3. 3 is not a perfect square. So reject.\n\nCase 3: a = 8. Then b = 11 - 8 = 3. Then a - b = 5. Not a perfect square. Reject.\n\nCase 4: a = 9. Then b = 11 - 9 = 2. Then a - b = 7. Not a perfect square. Reject.\n\nTherefore, only possible case is a = 6, b = 5. Therefore, AB = 10a + b = 10*6 + 5 = 65. Let me check if this works.\n\nLet me verify if with AB = 65, CD = 56. Then, compute d, the distance from H to O. Earlier, we had:\n\nd² = (99 / 4)(a - b)(a + b). Wait, but we had deduced that 11*(a - b)*(a + b) must be square, which became 121*(a - b). Then, since a - b = 1, then 121*1 = 121, which is 11². Therefore, going back:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nd² = (99 / 4)(a - b)(a + b). Wait, but we had:\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nFrom 4d² = 99(a - b)(a + b). Wait, let me check again.\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nWe had 4d² = 99(a - b)(a + b). Wait, no, let me go back.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nWe had 4d² = (L - M)(L + M) = 9(a - b)*11(a + b) = 99(a - b)(a + b). Therefore:\n\nd² = [99 / 4] * (a - b)(a + b). Since in our case, a - b = 1, a + b = 11, so:\n\nd² = 99 / 4 * 1 * 11 = 99 * 11 / 4 = 1089 / 4. Therefore, d = sqrt(1089 / 4) = 33 / 2 = 16.5. \n\nBut wait, AB is 65, so radius R is 65 / 2 = 32.5. Then, the distance from H to O is 16.5, which is less than R (32.5), so it is valid. Also, 16.5 is 33/2, which is a rational number, as required. Therefore, this works.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities. Wait, we had only a=6, b=5 as the case where 2a - 11 is a perfect square. But let me check if there are other possibilities where maybe a - b is zero? Wait, earlier we had that 11 divides (a - b)(a + b). But since a - b = 0 would mean 0, but then 11*0*... but then 11*0*(a + b) = 0, which is 0². However, if a - b = 0, then AB would be a two-digit number with equal digits, like 11, 22,..., 99. Then CD would be same number, since reversing digits. Then CD would be same as AB, so if CD is same length as AB and perpendicular, but AB is diameter, so CD would have to be another diameter. Then their intersection would be at the center, so distance from H to O would be zero, which is rational. But the problem says \"the distance from their intersection point H to the center O is a positive rational number.\" So zero is not positive, so these cases are excluded. Therefore, a - b cannot be zero. Hence, our only case is a=6, b=5, AB=65. \n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities where maybe a + b is multiple of 11? Wait, earlier reasoning said that since 11 divides (a - b)(a + b), and since a - b cannot be multiple of 11, then a + b must be multiple of 11. Since a + b is between 1 (if a=1, b=0) to 18. The multiples of 11 in that range are 11 and 22. 22 is too big, so only 11. Therefore, only a + b = 11. Therefore, our previous reasoning holds.\n\nBut let me check for a + b = 11 and a - b is perfect square. We found only a=6, b=5. Is there another possibility? Let me check again:\n\nFor a from 6 to 9:\n\na=6, b=5, a - b=1=1². Okay.\n\na=7, b=4, a - b=3. Not square.\n\na=8, b=3, a - b=5. Not square.\n\na=9, b=2, a - b=7. Not square.\n\nWhat if a + b=11 and a - b is a square? Let me think if there are other possibilities where maybe a - b is a square but negative? But we already concluded that since 121*(a - b) must be non-negative, so a - b must be non-negative, so only positive squares. Therefore, no.\n\nAlternatively, is there a case where a + b is 11 and a - b is 0? No, since that would require a = b, but a + b = 11 would mean 2a=11, which is not integer. So no.\n\nTherefore, only possible solution is AB=65. Let me check once again if this works with the problem's conditions.\n\nAB=65 (two-digit integer). CD=56 (reverse digits). They are perpendicular chords intersecting at H. The distance from H to O is 33/2=16.5, which is rational. So yes, that works. \n\nBut let me verify using another approach to make sure. Let me calculate coordinates. Let me take AB as diameter, length 65, radius 32.5. Let me take coordinates with O at (0, 0). Then AB is from (-32.5, 0) to (32.5, 0). Chord CD is perpendicular to AB at H, which is 16.5 units from O. Let me assume H is at (16.5, 0). Then CD is vertical line through (16.5, 0). The length of CD is 56, so half-length is 28. Therefore, coordinates of C and D are (16.5, 28) and (16.5, -28). Let me check if these points lie on the circle.\n\nEquation of circle: x² + y² = (32.5)². Let me compute 16.5² + 28².\n\nFirst, 16.5 squared: 16.5^2. Let me compute 16^2 + 2*16*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 256 + 16 + 0.25 = 272.25. Alternatively, 16.5^2 = (33/2)^2 = 1089 / 4 = 272.25.\n\n28^2 = 784.\n\nTotal: 272.25 + 784 = 1056.25. Now, radius squared is (32.5)^2 = (65/2)^2 = 4225 / 4 = 1056.25. Yes! So the points lie on the circle. Therefore, this is correct. \n\nTherefore, AB=65 is the solution. \n\nBut let me check if there are other possible values if we consider different reasoning. For example, suppose I made a mistake in assuming that 11 divides (a - b)(a + b) only if a + b is 11. Wait, 11 divides the product, so possibilities are 11 divides (a - b) or 11 divides (a + b). But since a - b can't be 11 or -11, as digits, then only possibility is 11 divides a + b. But a + b is between 1 and 18. So only 11. Therefore, no other possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, suppose that there is an error in my equation. Let me check again:\n\nWe had two chords AB (diameter) and CD intersecting at H perpendicularly. Then, by the formula for intersecting chords: AH * HB = CH * HD. Since CD is perpendicular to AB and H is midpoint of CD, then CH = HD = M / 2. Therefore, AH * HB = (M / 2)^2.\n\nLet me verify this formula. Yes, when two chords intersect, the products of the segments are equal. So AH * HB = CH * HD. Since CD is perpendicular to AB, and H is midpoint of CD, then CH = HD = M / 2. Therefore, AH * HB = (M / 2)^2. \n\nLet me compute AH and HB. Since AB is diameter of length L, so AB = L. Let me denote the distance from O to H as h. Then, since O is the center, AO = OB = L / 2. Depending on where H is, if H is h units from O towards B, then AH = AO + OH if H is on one side, or AH = AO - OH. Wait, let me think. Let me assume H is between O and B. Then, OH = h, so AH = AO + OH? No, if O is between A and H? Wait, AB is from A(-L/2, 0) to B(L/2, 0). If H is at distance h from O towards B, then coordinates of H is (h, 0). Therefore, AH is the distance from A(-L/2, 0) to H(h, 0): AH = h - (-L/2) = h + L/2. Similarly, HB is distance from H(h, 0) to B(L/2, 0): HB = L/2 - h. Therefore, AH * HB = (h + L/2)(L/2 - h) = (L/2)^2 - h^2. According to the chord intersection formula, this should equal (M / 2)^2. Therefore:\n\n(L/2)^2 - h^2 = (M / 2)^2\n\nTherefore:\n\nh^2 = (L/2)^2 - (M / 2)^2 = [L² - M²]/4\n\nTherefore:\n\nh = (1/2) * sqrt(L² - M²)\n\nBut earlier we had from coordinates that:\n\nFrom point C(d, e) on circle: d² + e² = R², with d = h (distance from O to H?), Wait, no. Wait in my coordinate system earlier, I considered H at (d, 0), and then for chord CD, which is vertical through H, so coordinates of C are (d, e). Therefore, in that case, d is the x-coordinate of H, which is h. Therefore, in that case, we had:\n\nh² + (M/2)^2 = R² => h² = R² - (M/2)^2. But R = L / 2, so:\n\nh² = (L²)/4 - M² / 4 = [L² - M²]/4, same as above. Therefore, h = (sqrt(L² - M²))/2. But the problem states that h is rational. Therefore, sqrt(L² - M²) must be rational, so L² - M² must be a perfect square. Wait, but L and M are integers (since they are two-digit numbers). Therefore, L² - M² must be a perfect square. Let me denote that:\n\nLet me compute L² - M². Since L = 10a + b, M = 10b + a. Therefore:\n\nL² - M² = (L - M)(L + M) = [9(a - b)][11(a + b)] = 99(a - b)(a + b). Therefore, sqrt(L² - M²) = sqrt(99(a - b)(a + b)). Therefore, h = sqrt(99(a - b)(a + b)) / 2. Therefore, for h to be rational, sqrt(99(a - b)(a + b)) must be rational. Since 99(a - b)(a + b) must be a perfect square. Which is same as previous reasoning. Therefore, same conclusion: 99(a - b)(a + b) is perfect square. Which led us to a + b = 11 and a - b is square. Therefore, only solution is AB=65. \n\nTherefore, I think this is correct. Let me check if there are other two-digit numbers where reversing digits gives another number, and L² - M² is a perfect square. For example, suppose there is another pair (a, b) where a + b = 11 and a - b is square. But as we saw, only a=6, b=5. Are there other possibilities if a + b is not 11? For example, suppose that 99(a - b)(a + b) is a perfect square without requiring that 11 divides (a - b)(a + b). Wait, but 99 factors into 9*11. Therefore, 99(a - b)(a + b) = 9*11*(a - b)(a + b). For this to be square, since 9 is square, we need 11*(a - b)(a + b) to be square. Therefore, same as before. Therefore, 11 divides the product (a - b)(a + b). Which requires that 11 divides a + b or a - b. Since a - b can't be 11, only a + b = 11. Therefore, same conclusion. Therefore, only AB=65.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are other two-digit numbers where L² - M² is a perfect square, even if a + b ≠ 11. For example, suppose that 11*(a - b)(a + b) is square even if 11 doesn't divide (a - b)(a + b). Wait, but 11 is prime. If 11 divides the product, then it must divide one of the factors. If 11 does not divide the product, then 11*(a - b)(a + b) cannot be square because it would have a prime factor 11 to the first power. Therefore, only way for 11*(a - b)(a + b) to be square is if 11 divides (a - b)(a + b). Therefore, only possibilities are a + b = 11 or a - b = 11. But a - b = 11 is impossible since digits. Therefore, only a + b = 11. Hence, only AB=65. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 65. Let me check once more with another example. Let me take AB=65 and CD=56. Then, L² - M² = 65² - 56² = (65 - 56)(65 + 56) = 9*121 = 1089, which is 33². Therefore, h = 33 / 2 = 16.5, which is rational. Perfect. \n\nIs there another pair? For example, if a + b = 11 and a - b is square. Suppose hypothetically if a - b was 4. Then 2a - 11 = 4 => 2a = 15 => a = 7.5, not integer. Similarly, if a - b = 9 (another square). Then 2a - 11 = 9 => 2a = 20 => a = 10. Not a digit. If a - b = 0, square, but leads to zero distance. If a - b = 1, square, gives a = 6. If a - b = 4, no. If a - b = 9, no. If a - b = 16? No. Therefore, no other possibilities. Hence, unique solution AB=65. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{65}\n</think>"}
