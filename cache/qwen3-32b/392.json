Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says: A moving 1.5-kg cart collides with and sticks to a 0.5-kg cart which was initially at rest. Immediately after the collision, the carts each have the same ______ as each other. The options are Velocity, Kinetic energy, Mass, or Linear momentum.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens in a collision where the objects stick together. I think this is called a perfectly inelastic collision because the two objects stick together after the collision, and kinetic energy isn't conserved here, right? But linear momentum should be conserved because there are no external forces acting on the system during the collision. So the total momentum before the collision should equal the total momentum after the collision.\n\nLet me write down the given information. The first cart has a mass of 1.5 kg and is moving, so it has some initial velocity. The second cart has a mass of 0.5 kg and is initially at rest, so its initial velocity is 0. After the collision, they stick together, so they move as one combined mass. Wait, but the question says \"the carts each have the same ______ as each other.\" So each cart individually has the same value for that quantity? Or since they're stuck together, they have the same value for that quantity as the combined system?\n\nHmm. Let me think. If they stick together, they move with the same velocity, right? Because they're stuck together. So their velocities are the same. But the question is phrased as \"each have the same ______ as each other.\" So if they are stuck together, they both have the same velocity. So maybe the answer is velocity? But let me check the other options.\n\nMass? The mass of each cart doesn't change during the collision. The first cart is still 1.5 kg, and the second is 0.5 kg. So they don't have the same mass. So option C is out.\n\nKinetic energy? In a perfectly inelastic collision, kinetic energy isn't conserved. In fact, it's the maximum amount of kinetic energy that can be lost while still conserving momentum. So the kinetic energy after the collision is less than before. Also, since they are stuck together, they have the same velocity, so their individual kinetic energies would be (1/2)m1v² and (1/2)m2v². Since their masses are different, their individual kinetic energies would be different. Therefore, they don't have the same kinetic energy. So option B is out.\n\nLinear momentum? Let me think. The total linear momentum is conserved, but does each cart have the same linear momentum? If they are stuck together and moving with the same velocity, their individual linear momenta would be m1v and m2v. Since m1 and m2 are different, their individual momenta would be different. However, the total momentum is (m1 + m2)v. But the question is asking what each cart has the same as each other. Since their individual momenta are different, linear momentum isn't the same for each. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, after the collision, they are stuck together, so they are one object. So each cart, as part of the combined system, has the same velocity. But if you consider them as separate entities (even though they're stuck together), do they have the same linear momentum? No, because their masses are different. So linear momentum isn't the same for each. So option D is out.\n\nSo that leaves velocity as the answer. But let me confirm with equations. Let's do some calculations.\n\nLet me denote the initial velocity of the 1.5-kg cart as v1i. The 0.5-kg cart is at rest, so v2i = 0. After the collision, they stick together, so their final velocity is vf. Since they are stuck together, both carts have this same velocity vf. So that would make option A: velocity correct.\n\nBut let's check with numbers. Suppose the initial velocity of the 1.5-kg cart is, say, 2 m/s. Then the initial momentum is (1.5 kg)(2 m/s) + (0.5 kg)(0 m/s) = 3 kg·m/s. After the collision, the combined mass is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.0 kg. The final velocity vf would be total momentum divided by total mass: 3 / 2 = 1.5 m/s. So each cart has velocity 1.5 m/s. So velocity is the same for both. \n\nWhat about kinetic energy? Before collision, KE is (1/2)(1.5)(2²) + 0 = 3 J. After collision, KE is (1/2)(2.0)(1.5²) = 2.25 J. So total KE decreased. Also, individual KEs after collision: for 1.5 kg cart: (1/2)(1.5)(1.5²) ≈ 1.6875 J, and for 0.5 kg cart: (1/2)(0.5)(1.5²) ≈ 0.5625 J. These are different, so KE isn't same for each. \n\nLinear momentum after collision: for 1.5 kg cart: 1.5 kg * 1.5 m/s = 2.25 kg·m/s. For 0.5 kg cart: 0.5 kg * 1.5 m/s = 0.75 kg·m/s. These add up to 3 kg·m/s, which matches the initial momentum. But individually they are different. So linear momentum isn't same for each. \n\nMass is obviously different. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A: Velocity. \n\nWait, but the question says \"immediately after the collision, the carts each have the same ______ as each other.\" So even though they are stuck together, they each have the same velocity. So yes, velocity is the correct answer. \n\nAnother way to think: in any collision where objects stick together, they move with a common velocity. Hence, velocity is same. So answer is A. \n\nBut let me check if there's a trick here. Sometimes questions can be tricky. For example, if they had asked about total momentum, but no, the question is about each having the same as the other. So yeah, velocity is the only one that fits. \n\nSo the answer is A: Velocity.\n</think>"}
