Let me start by recalling some basic principles of buoyancy. I remember that Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. \n\nFirst, let me note down the given information. The cube has a side length of 0.5 meters, so its volume can be calculated. The mass of the cube is 100 kg. The density of the fluid is 1200 kg/m³. I need to find the fraction of the cube's volume that is above the fluid.\n\nLet me start by calculating the volume of the cube. Since it's a cube, volume V = side³. So:\n\nV = (0.5 m)³ = 0.125 m³.\n\nOkay, so the total volume of the cube is 0.125 cubic meters.\n\nNow, the cube's density can be calculated by dividing its mass by its volume. Let me compute that:\n\nDensity of cube, ρ_cube = mass / volume = 100 kg / 0.125 m³ = 800 kg/m³.\n\nHmm, so the cube's density is 800 kg/m³, and the fluid's density is 1200 kg/m³. Since the cube is less dense than the fluid, it should float. The question is, how much of it is above the surface?\n\nI remember that the fraction submerged can be found by the ratio of the object's density to the fluid's density. Let me recall the formula. If an object floats, the fraction submerged (V_submerged / V_total) is equal to ρ_object / ρ_fluid. Is that right?\n\nLet me think. The buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. For the object to float, the buoyant force must equal the object's weight. So:\n\nWeight of object = Weight of displaced fluid.\n\nWhich is:\n\nm_object * g = ρ_fluid * V_submerged * g.\n\nCanceling out g:\n\nm_object = ρ_fluid * V_submerged.\n\nBut m_object is also equal to ρ_object * V_total. Therefore:\n\nρ_object * V_total = ρ_fluid * V_submerged.\n\nTherefore, V_submerged / V_total = ρ_object / ρ_fluid.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the fraction submerged is the ratio of the densities. Therefore, the fraction above the fluid would be 1 - (ρ_object / ρ_fluid).\n\nSo let me compute that. Given that ρ_object is 800 kg/m³ and ρ_fluid is 1200 kg/m³:\n\nFraction submerged = 800 / 1200 = 2/3. Therefore, the fraction above the fluid is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nWait, so the answer would be 1/3, which is option B. Let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nLet me verify with numbers. The mass of the cube is 100 kg. The total volume is 0.125 m³. The density of the cube is indeed 100 / 0.125 = 800 kg/m³. The fluid is 1200 kg/m³. So the ratio is 800/1200 = 2/3 submerged, so 1/3 above. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the volume submerged using the equations.\n\nThe weight of the cube is m * g = 100 kg * 9.81 m/s². The buoyant force is ρ_fluid * V_submerged * g. Setting them equal:\n\n100 kg * g = 1200 kg/m³ * V_submerged * g\n\nCanceling g:\n\n100 kg = 1200 kg/m³ * V_submerged\n\nTherefore, V_submerged = 100 / 1200 m³ = 1/12 m³ ≈ 0.0833 m³.\n\nTotal volume of cube is 0.125 m³. Therefore, the fraction submerged is (1/12) / 0.125. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 0.125 is 1/8. So (1/12) divided by (1/8) is (1/12) * (8/1) = 8/12 = 2/3. So again, fraction submerged is 2/3, so fraction above is 1/3. So answer is B: 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Let me check if there are any other factors I might have missed. For example, is the cube fully submerged? Well, since its density is less than the fluid, it should float. If it were denser, it would sink. Since 800 < 1200, it floats. The calculation seems right. The math checks out both ways. So I think B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
