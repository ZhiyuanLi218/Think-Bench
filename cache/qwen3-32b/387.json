Let me try to understand what's given and what's being asked. \n\nThe problem says: There are 40 lines in a plane, and no two are parallel. So, all lines intersect each other. Then, there are specific numbers of points where certain numbers of lines intersect. Specifically:\n\n- 3 points where exactly 3 lines intersect.\n- 4 points where exactly 4 lines intersect.\n- 5 points where exactly 5 lines intersect.\n- 6 points where exactly 6 lines intersect.\n- No points where more than 6 lines intersect.\n\nAnd the question is asking for the number of points where exactly 2 lines intersect.\n\nAlright, so first, I need to recall some concepts about lines and intersections. If there are n lines in a plane with no two parallel and no three concurrent (meaning no three lines meet at a single point), then the number of intersection points is C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2. Because each pair of lines intersects exactly once.\n\nBut in this problem, there are points where multiple lines intersect (3, 4, 5, 6 lines), so we can't just use that formula directly. Instead, we need to adjust for those multiple intersections.\n\nLet me think. Let me denote:\n\nLet’s say that if we have k points where exactly m lines intersect, then each such point accounts for C(m, 2) intersections. But since each intersection is counted once for each pair of lines that meet there. However, the total number of intersections (if we count with multiplicity) should be equal to the total number of intersections if all lines were in general position (i.e., no two parallel, no three concurrent), which is C(40, 2) = 780.\n\nWait, but in reality, when multiple lines intersect at the same point, that single point accounts for multiple intersections. For example, if three lines meet at a point, that single point accounts for C(3, 2) = 3 intersections (each pair of those three lines intersecting there). However, if those three lines were in general position, they would have intersected at three different points. Therefore, by having them intersect at a single point, we have reduced the total number of intersection points by (C(3, 2) - 1) = 2. Similarly for higher numbers.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the idea is to calculate the total number of intersections assuming all lines are in general position, then subtract the overcounts caused by multiple lines intersecting at the same point.\n\nBut how to formalize this?\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s let T be the total number of intersections if all lines are in general position. So T = C(40, 2) = 780.\n\nNow, suppose we have points where multiple lines intersect. Let me denote:\n\nLet’s say there are p_m points where exactly m lines intersect. In the problem, we are given p_3 = 3, p_4 = 4, p_5 = 5, p_6 = 6, and p_m = 0 for m > 6. We need to find p_2, the number of points where exactly 2 lines intersect.\n\nBut note that the total number of intersections can also be calculated as the sum over all points of (number of intersections at that point). However, each point where m lines meet contributes C(m, 2) intersections (i.e., the number of pairs of lines that meet there). However, in reality, each intersection point is counted once, but if we think of the total number of pairs of lines, it's equal to the sum over all points of C(m, 2), where m is the number of lines intersecting at that point.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs of lines, which is fixed at T = 780, is equal to the sum over all points of C(m, 2). Therefore:\n\nSum_{m >= 2} [ p_m * C(m, 2) ] = T = 780.\n\nTherefore, if we can compute this sum, we can set up an equation and solve for p_2.\n\nGiven that, let me write that equation.\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\nFor m=2: p_2 * C(2,2) = p_2 * 1 = p_2.\n\nFor m=3: 3 * C(3,2) = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nFor m=4: 4 * C(4,2) = 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nFor m=5: 5 * C(5,2) = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nFor m=6: 6 * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is p_2 + 9 + 24 + 50 + 90 = p_2 + 173.\n\nAnd this must equal 780. Therefore:\n\np_2 + 173 = 780 => p_2 = 780 - 173 = 607.\n\nWait, so is the answer 607? But that seems straightforward. However, I need to make sure that there isn't another condition that I have to satisfy here. Because in addition to this equation, there might be another condition regarding the number of intersection points?\n\nWait, the problem says \"no points where more than 6 lines intersect,\" but we already considered that by only going up to m=6. However, there is another aspect here: each intersection point is counted once in the p_m counts. Therefore, the total number of intersection points is Sum_{m >= 2} p_m. However, the problem already gives us some p_m values, and asks for p_2. However, in my previous calculation, I didn't use that. Wait, but maybe there is another equation here? Wait, no. The equation I used is based on the total number of pairs of lines, which must equal 780. Therefore, if I can compute that sum, then I can find p_2. However, maybe there is another condition?\n\nWait, but perhaps there is an issue with overcounting? For example, if multiple intersections are considered. Wait, but no, the way I set up the equation is correct. Because each pair of lines intersects exactly once, so the total number of pairs of lines is fixed. However, if multiple lines meet at a point, then that single point accounts for multiple pairs. Therefore, the equation Sum_{m} p_m * C(m, 2) = C(40, 2) must hold. Therefore, solving for p_2 gives 780 - 173 = 607.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose we have n lines, and some concurrent lines. For example, suppose n=3, and all three lines meet at a single point. Then, according to this formula, Sum_{m} p_m * C(m, 2) = 1*C(3,2)=3, which is equal to C(3,2)=3. So that works. However, in reality, there is only 1 intersection point instead of 3. However, the formula is correct because the total number of pairs is still 3, just concentrated at one point.\n\nTherefore, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, in our problem, if we compute p_2 as 780 - 173 = 607, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again:\n\nGiven:\n\np_3 = 3, contributes 3 * C(3,2) = 3*3=9.\n\np_4 = 4, contributes 4*6=24.\n\np_5 = 5, contributes 5*10=50.\n\np_6 = 6, contributes 6*15=90.\n\nTotal from m=3 to m=6: 9 + 24 + 50 + 90.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n9 + 24 = 33.\n\n33 + 50 = 83.\n\n83 + 90 = 173. Correct.\n\nTotal sum is p_2 + 173 = 780. Therefore p_2 = 780 - 173 = 607.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 607?\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's something wrong here. For example, maybe the problem is that when multiple lines intersect at a point, the number of lines is being counted multiple times? Or perhaps there is another equation?\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each line has 39 intersections (since there are 40 lines, each line intersects with 39 others). However, if a line passes through multiple intersection points, then each of those points is where it intersects another line.\n\nBut perhaps this is more complicated. Let me think. Suppose each line is involved in multiple intersection points. However, if there are concurrent lines, then a single line can be part of multiple intersection points. For example, if three lines meet at a point, then each of those lines also meets other lines at different points.\n\nBut maybe this approach is more complicated. However, perhaps there is another formula here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the concept of duality or something else, but perhaps not necessary.\n\nWait, but let me check if 607 is a reasonable answer. Let me compute the total number of intersection points. The total number of intersection points would be p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6. Which would be 607 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 607 + 18 = 625.\n\nBut with 40 lines in general position, the number of intersections would be C(40, 2) = 780. But in our case, it's 625. Which is less, as expected, because multiple intersections reduce the total number of points. So, the difference between 780 and 625 is 155. Which would be the amount of \"saved\" points due to multiple intersections.\n\nBut how much is that? Each point where m lines meet saves C(m, 2) - 1 points. For example, a 3-line intersection saves 3 - 1 = 2 points. Similarly, a 4-line intersection saves 6 - 1 = 5 points, etc.\n\nSo total saved points would be Sum_{m} p_m*(C(m,2) - 1). Which in our case would be:\n\nFor m=3: 3*(3 - 1) = 3*2 = 6.\n\nFor m=4: 4*(6 - 1) = 4*5 = 20.\n\nFor m=5: 5*(10 - 1) = 5*9 = 45.\n\nFor m=6: 6*(15 - 1) = 6*14 = 84.\n\nTotal saved points: 6 + 20 + 45 + 84 = let's see:\n\n6 + 20 = 26; 26 + 45 = 71; 71 + 84 = 155. Which is the difference between 780 and 625. Therefore, that seems to check out. Therefore, the total number of intersection points is 780 - 155 = 625, which is p_2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = p_2 + 18. Therefore, p_2 = 625 - 18 = 607. Which is the same answer. Therefore, this seems to confirm that 607 is correct.\n\nTherefore, maybe my initial answer is correct. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming that all intersections are accounted for by these points? For example, could there be some overlap or something? But the problem says \"no points where more than 6 lines intersect,\" so we have considered all the intersections where 3,4,5,6 lines meet, and the rest are intersections where exactly 2 lines meet. Therefore, the total number of intersection points is p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6, and the total number of pairs is Sum p_m*C(m, 2) = 780. Therefore, solving gives p_2 = 780 - 173 = 607. Therefore, the answer is 607.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example. Let me take a case where I know the answer. For example, suppose there are 3 lines, all concurrent. Then, p_3 = 1, p_2 = 0. Then according to the formula, total pairs is 1*C(3,2) = 3, which is equal to C(3,2)=3. Correct. If we have 4 lines, with one point where 3 lines meet, and the fourth line intersecting the others not at that point. Then:\n\nTotal intersections: The three lines meet at one point. The fourth line intersects each of the other three lines at three distinct points. Therefore, total intersection points: 1 + 3 = 4. According to our formula:\n\nTotal pairs: C(4,2)=6.\n\nSum over p_m*C(m,2): p_3*C(3,2) + p_2*C(2,2). Here p_3=1, p_2=3. Wait, but according to the problem, p_2 would be 3? Wait, total intersection points are 1 (with 3 lines) and 3 points with 2 lines each. Therefore, p_2=3, p_3=1. Then the total Sum is 1*3 + 3*1 = 6, which equals C(4,2)=6. Correct. Therefore, the formula works here.\n\nAlternatively, if all four lines are concurrent, then p_4=1, and Sum is 1*C(4,2)=6, which is correct, and total number of intersection points is 1.\n\nTherefore, the formula works. Therefore, in our problem, the answer is 607.\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again to make sure I didn't misread anything.\n\n\"A plane contains 40 lines, no 2 of which are parallel. Suppose that there are 3 points where exactly 3 lines intersect, 4 points where exactly 4 lines intersect, 5 points where exactly 5 lines intersect, 6 points where exactly 6 lines intersect, and no points where more than 6 lines intersect. Find the number of points where exactly 2 lines intersect.\"\n\nYes, that's what I used. So p_3=3, p_4=4, p_5=5, p_6=6. Therefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, answer is 607.\n\nBut let me check once more the arithmetic:\n\nTotal from 3,4,5,6 points:\n\nFor p_3: 3 * 3C2 = 3 * 3 = 9\n\np_4: 4 * 4C2 = 4 * 6 = 24\n\np_5: 5 * 5C2 = 5 * 10 = 50\n\np_6: 6 * 6C2 = 6 * 15 = 90\n\nTotal sum: 9 + 24 + 50 + 90 = 9 + 24 is 33, 33 + 50 is 83, 83 + 90 is 173. Then total pairs is 780, so p_2 = 780 - 173 = 607. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct answer. However, since the problem is from an Olympiad or competition, sometimes there might be a trick or something I missed. Let me think again.\n\nIs there a possibility that some lines are concurrent at multiple points? For example, if a line is part of multiple concurrent intersections? Wait, but in general, two lines intersect at only one point. So, if a line is part of a 3-line intersection, it can't be part of another 3-line intersection unless more lines are concurrent. However, the problem says there are no points with more than 6 lines. However, a single line can be part of multiple intersection points, as long as each intersection point isn't having too many lines.\n\nBut how does that affect our calculation? Our calculation assumes that each pair of lines intersects exactly once, and that all intersections are accounted for in the p_m counts. Since no two lines are parallel, they must intersect somewhere, and that intersection is either a regular 2-line intersection or part of one of the multiple intersections (3,4,5,6 lines). Therefore, as long as all intersections are accounted for, the formula holds. Therefore, unless there's an overlap in the counts, i.e., if a single intersection point is counted in multiple p_m, but the problem states that there are 3 points with exactly 3 lines, etc., so each point is counted once in exactly one p_m.\n\nTherefore, the counts p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6 are distinct points, each contributing to their respective m. Therefore, there is no overcounting in the p_m terms.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 607.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check another angle. Let me think about how many times each line is involved in intersections.\n\nEach line intersects with 39 other lines. Therefore, for each line, the number of intersections on it is equal to the number of points where it crosses other lines. Now, if a line is part of some multiple intersections (e.g., passing through a point where 3 lines meet), then those intersections account for multiple lines on that line.\n\nFor example, suppose a line passes through one point where 3 lines meet. That means on this line, there are two other lines passing through that point. Therefore, on this line, one intersection point accounts for two intersections (since our line intersects two other lines at that single point). Whereas normally, each intersection is a unique point where it meets another line.\n\nTherefore, if we consider a single line, let’s say it is involved in k multiple intersections. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet’s take a line L. Let’s say that on line L, there are t_3 points where 3 lines meet (so besides L, there are two other lines at each such point), t_4 points where 4 lines meet (so besides L, three other lines), ..., t_6 points where 6 lines meet (besides L, five other lines). Then, the total number of intersections on line L is:\n\nFor each t_m, the number of other lines intersecting L at those points is (m - 1) * t_m. But since L intersects 39 other lines in total, we have:\n\nSum_{m=3}^6 (m - 1) * t_m + (number of regular intersections) = 39.\n\nThe number of regular intersections is the number of points on L where only two lines intersect, which would be equal to p_2 intersections on L. But each such intersection is a unique point for each other line. However, since we are counting the number of intersections on L, each regular intersection is one point, but each contributes one intersection (with one other line). Therefore, if there are x regular intersections on L, then x = 39 - Sum_{m=3}^6 (m - 1)*t_m.\n\nBut how does this relate to the total counts?\n\nBut here's the problem: If we consider all lines, we can sum over all lines the number of multiple intersections they are part of. However, each multiple intersection point is on several lines. For example, a point where 3 lines meet is on 3 lines, and each of those lines has a t_3 count increased by 1.\n\nTherefore, if we take the total over all lines of Sum_{m=3}^6 (m - 1) * t_m, that would be equal to Sum_{m=3}^6 (m - 1) * (number of times this occurs on all lines). But each point with m lines contributes (m - 1) to each of the m lines passing through it. Therefore, total over all lines would be Sum_{m=3}^6 [ p_m * m * (m - 1) ].\n\nWait, let me think again. For a single point where m lines meet, each of those m lines has (m - 1) intersections accounted for at that point. Therefore, for that single point, the total contribution to the sum over all lines of Sum (m - 1)*t_m is m*(m - 1). Therefore, overall, the total sum over all lines of [ Sum_{m=3}^6 (m - 1) * t_m ] equals Sum_{m=3}^6 [ p_m * m(m - 1) ].\n\nBut on the other hand, for each line, the Sum [ ... ] is equal to 39 - x, where x is the number of regular intersections on that line. Therefore, if we sum over all lines, we get 40 * 39 - total number of regular intersections.\n\nBut the total number of regular intersections is p_2, since each regular intersection is on exactly two lines, but wait no: p_2 is the number of points where exactly two lines meet. Each such point is one intersection point, and is counted once in p_2. However, when we consider the number of regular intersections on each line, each regular intersection on a line corresponds to one point where that line intersects another line, and each such point is in p_2. Therefore, if we sum over all lines the number of regular intersections on each line, we get 2 * p_2, because each point in p_2 is counted twice, once for each line.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nSum_{lines} [ 39 - x_i ] = 40*39 - 2*p_2, where x_i is the number of regular intersections on line i.\n\nBut also, this sum equals Sum_{lines} [ Sum_{m=3}^6 (m - 1)*t_m ] = Sum_{m=3}^6 [ p_m * m(m - 1) ].\n\nTherefore:\n\n40*39 - 2*p_2 = Sum_{m=3}^6 [ p_m * m(m - 1) ].\n\nTherefore, we can use this equation to solve for p_2 as well. Let me compute both sides.\n\nFirst, left-hand side: 40*39 - 2*p_2 = 1560 - 2*p_2.\n\nRight-hand side: For each m from 3 to 6:\n\nFor m=3: p_3 * 3*(3 - 1) = 3 * 3 * 2 = 18.\n\nFor m=4: p_4 * 4*3 = 4 * 4 * 3 = 48? Wait, p_4 is 4, m is 4, so 4 * 4 * 3? Wait no:\n\nWait, the formula is Sum_{m=3}^6 [ p_m * m(m - 1) ].\n\nSo for m=3, it's p_3 * 3*(3 - 1) = 3 * 3 * 2? Wait, no. Wait p_3 is 3, and m(m-1) is 3*2=6. Therefore, 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nSimilarly, m=4: p_4=4, m(m-1)=4*3=12. Therefore, 4*12=48.\n\nm=5: p_5=5, m(m-1)=5*4=20. Therefore, 5*20=100.\n\nm=6: p_6=6, m(m-1)=6*5=30. Therefore, 6*30=180.\n\nTherefore, total RHS is 18 + 48 + 100 + 180 = let's compute:\n\n18 + 48 = 66; 66 + 100 = 166; 166 + 180 = 346.\n\nTherefore, equation is:\n\n1560 - 2*p_2 = 346 => 2*p_2 = 1560 - 346 = ?\n\nCalculate 1560 - 346:\n\n1560 - 300 = 1260\n\n1260 - 46 = 1214.\n\nTherefore, 2*p_2 = 1214 => p_2 = 607. Same result!\n\nTherefore, this confirms the answer is indeed 607. Therefore, regardless of the approach, whether considering the total number of pairs or considering the total number of intersections per line, we arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I think this is solid. So the answer is 607.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{607}\n</think>"}
