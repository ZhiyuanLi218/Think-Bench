So, there's a girl with mass m and a boy with mass 2m sitting on opposite sides of a see-saw. The fulcrum is in the center right now. They are equally far from the fulcrum, but the see-saw tilts in favor of the boy. The question is asking which of the options A to D would NOT be a possible method to balance the see-saw.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a see-saw works. It's a lever with a fulcrum. The torque (which is force times distance from the fulcrum) determines which side goes down. If the torques on both sides are equal, the see-saw balances. Torque is calculated as mass times gravity times distance from the fulcrum. Since gravity is the same on both sides, we can ignore it for comparison purposes and just consider mass times distance.\n\nRight now, the boy is on one side with mass 2m and the girl on the other with mass m. They are both at the same distance from the fulcrum, let's say distance d. So the torque from the boy is 2m * d, and the torque from the girl is m * d. Since 2md is greater than md, the boy's side goes down, which matches the problem statement that it tilts in his favor.\n\nNow, we need to find out which of the options would NOT balance the see-saw. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Move the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum. So originally, the boy was at distance d. If we move him to d/2, his torque becomes 2m * (d/2) = md. The girl is still at distance d with torque md. So both sides have torque md. That would balance. So option A is a possible method. Therefore, it's not the correct answer (since the question asks which is NOT possible).\n\nOption B: Move the girl to double her original distance from the fulcrum. Originally, the girl was at distance d. If we move her to 2d, her torque becomes m * 2d = 2md. The boy's torque is still 2m * d = 2md. So both sides are equal. That would balance. So B is a possible method, not the answer.\n\nOption C: Allow a second girl of mass m to join the first. So now there are two girls on the girl's side, each of mass m. Total mass on the girl's side is m + m = 2m. Assuming they are both sitting at the same distance d from the fulcrum. Then torque would be 2m * d. The boy is still 2m * d. So both sides equal. That would balance. But wait, does the problem say where the second girl is sitting? It just says \"join the first.\" If they join, maybe they are sitting at the same spot or same distance? If they are both sitting at distance d, then yes, total torque doubles. If they are sitting at different distances, maybe not. But the problem probably assumes that adding another girl of mass m at the same distance. So option C would balance. Therefore, C is possible and not the answer.\n\nOption D: Move the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy. Hmm. Originally, the fulcrum was in the center, so the distance from the boy to the fulcrum was d. If we move the fulcrum so that its distance from the boy is half of that, so d/2. Then, what's the new distance from the girl to the fulcrum?\n\nOriginally, the see-saw was a certain length. Let's assume the total length is 2d, so each side from the center is d. If we move the fulcrum closer to the boy, making his side d/2, then the girl's side would be the total length minus d/2. Wait, but we don't know the total length. Maybe we need to think differently.\n\nLet me think. Initially, fulcrum is at center. Let's say the boy is on the left, girl on the right. The original distance from fulcrum for both is L. Now, moving the fulcrum so that its distance from the boy is half of original. Original distance was L, so new distance from boy is L/2. Therefore, the distance from the girl to the new fulcrum would be the original distance plus the distance the fulcrum moved? Wait, if the fulcrum is moved towards the boy, then the girl's side becomes longer.\n\nLet me draw a diagram mentally. Suppose the see-saw is a straight bar. Initially, fulcrum is at center. Let’s denote the original distance from fulcrum to boy is L, so total length of see-saw is 2L. Now, moving the fulcrum towards the boy so that the distance from the boy to fulcrum is L/2. That means the fulcrum has moved L - L/2 = L/2 towards the boy. Therefore, on the girl's side, the distance from fulcrum would be original L + L/2 = 3L/2. Because the total length is 2L, so if the fulcrum is L/2 away from the boy, then from the other end (where the girl was originally), it's 2L - L/2 = 3L/2.\n\nSo now, the boy is at distance L/2, with mass 2m. His torque is 2m * (L/2) = mL. The girl is at distance 3L/2, with mass m. Her torque is m * (3L/2) = (3/2)mL. Comparing the two, mL vs. 1.5mL. The girl's torque is larger now. Therefore, the see-saw would tilt towards the girl. But the original problem was tilting towards the boy. If we move the fulcrum as in option D, it would balance? Wait, no. The torques are mL vs 1.5mL. They are not equal. Therefore, it would not balance. Wait, but the question is asking which would NOT be a possible method to balance. So if moving the fulcrum as in D does not balance, then D is the answer. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recast the problem with variables.\n\nLet me denote original distance from fulcrum for both boy and girl as x. Original torque from boy is 2m * x, girl is m * x. Since 2m x > m x, boy's side down.\n\nOption D says move the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy. Original distance from boy was x. New distance is x/2. Now, where is the fulcrum in relation to the girl? Assuming the total length of the see-saw is 2x (since originally fulcrum was in center, each side is x). If we move fulcrum towards the boy by some amount so that the new distance from boy is x/2, then the new distance from the girl would be total length minus new distance from boy. Total length is 2x, so new distance from girl is 2x - x/2 = 3x/2.\n\nTherefore, torque from boy is 2m * (x/2) = m x.\n\nTorque from girl is m * (3x/2) = (3/2) m x.\n\nSo the torques are m x vs 1.5 m x. Therefore, the girl's side has more torque, so the see-saw would tilt towards the girl. Therefore, this does not balance. Therefore, option D does not balance the see-saw. Therefore, D is the answer, the method that would NOT balance.\n\nBut let me check again. Wait, maybe there's another way to interpret moving the fulcrum. The problem says \"Move the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy.\" Original distance from the boy was, let's say, d. Now it's moved so that the distance is d/2. So if originally the fulcrum was at center, distance from boy was d, now moving fulcrum closer to boy so distance is d/2. Therefore, on the other side, the distance from fulcrum to girl becomes original distance plus the distance the fulcrum moved. Since fulcrum was moved towards the boy by d - d/2 = d/2. Therefore, girl's side is original d + d/2 = 3d/2. Therefore, same as above. So torque boy is 2m*(d/2) = md, torque girl is m*(3d/2) = 1.5 md. Not equal. So D does not balance. Therefore, D is the correct answer because it's the one that does NOT balance. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check the other options again to make sure.\n\nOption A: Move the boy to half his original distance. So boy's torque becomes 2m*(d/2) = md. Girl's torque is m*d = md. Balanced. Good.\n\nOption B: Move girl to double her distance. Girl's torque m*(2d) = 2md. Boy's torque 2m*d = 2md. Balanced. Good.\n\nOption C: Add another girl of mass m. Total mass on girl's side is 2m. Assuming they are at same distance d. Torque is 2m*d. Boy's torque is 2m*d. Balanced. Good.\n\nSo only D does not balance. Therefore, D is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
