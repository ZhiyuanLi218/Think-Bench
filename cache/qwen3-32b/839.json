Let me recall how rotation of complex numbers works. I think when you rotate a complex number around another point, you first translate the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back. \n\nLet me write down the formula. If we have a point z and we want to rotate it around a point c by an angle θ, then the rotated point w is given by:\n\nw = (z - c) * e^(iθ) + c\n\nIs that right? Let me check. Yes, because subtracting c moves the center to the origin, multiplying by e^(iθ) rotates it, and adding c moves it back. So that seems correct.\n\nSo in this case, θ is π/4 counter-clockwise, so θ = π/4. Therefore, e^(iπ/4) is cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) which is √2/2 + i√2/2. Let me compute that value. \n\nBut first, let me write down z and c. Given z = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i. Let me parse this. In complex numbers, usually written as a + bi. So here, the real part is 2 + √2, and the imaginary part is -(3 + 3√2). Therefore, z can be written as (2 + √2) - (3 + 3√2)i. \n\nAnd c is 2 - 3i, so that's real part 2, imaginary part -3. \n\nSo first, compute z - c. Let me do that. \n\nz - c = [ (2 + √2) - 2 ] + [ - (3 + 3√2) - (-3) ] i \n\nSimplify:\n\nReal part: 2 + √2 - 2 = √2\n\nImaginary part: - (3 + 3√2) + 3 = -3 - 3√2 + 3 = -3√2\n\nTherefore, z - c = √2 - 3√2 i. \n\nSo z - c is √2(1 - 3i). \n\nNow, multiply this by e^(iπ/4). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, e^(iπ/4) is (√2/2 + i√2/2). \n\nAlternatively, in complex numbers, multiplying by e^(iθ) is equivalent to rotating by θ. So I need to compute:\n\n(√2 - 3√2 i) * (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4))\n\nLet me compute this multiplication. Let me write it out:\n\nLet me denote A = √2, B = -3√2, and the rotation factor is cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = √2/2 + i√2/2. \n\nTherefore, multiplying (A + Bi) by (√2/2 + i√2/2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, expand the product:\n\nA*(√2/2) + A*(i√2/2) + Bi*(√2/2) + Bi*(i√2/2)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: A*(√2/2) = √2*(√2/2) = (2)/2 = 1\n\nSecond term: A*i√2/2 = √2 * i√2 / 2 = i*(2)/2 = i*1 = i\n\nThird term: Bi*(√2/2) = (-3√2)*i*(√2)/2 = -3√2 * √2 / 2 * i = -3*(2)/2 * i = -3i\n\nFourth term: Bi*(i√2/2) = (-3√2)*i*(i√2)/2 = (-3√2)*(i²)*(√2)/2 = (-3√2)*(-1)*(√2)/2 = 3√2 * √2 / 2 = 3*(2)/2 = 3\n\nTherefore, adding all four terms:\n\nFirst term + Second term + Third term + Fourth term = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i\n\nSo the result of multiplying (z - c) by e^(iπ/4) is 4 - 2i.\n\nThen, adding back c to this result gives us w:\n\nw = (4 - 2i) + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 - 5i.\n\nWait, so according to this calculation, w is 6 - 5i. Let me check if I did all steps correctly. \n\nFirst, z - c: original z is 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i, c is 2 - 3i. So subtracting c from z:\n\nReal part: (2 + √2) - 2 = √2. Correct.\n\nImaginary part: [ - (3 + 3√2) - (-3) ] = -3 - 3√2 + 3 = -3√2. Correct. So z - c is √2 - 3√2 i. Correct.\n\nThen multiplying by e^(iπ/4). Let me verify the multiplication again. \n\nOriginal complex number: √2 - 3√2 i. Let me factor out √2: √2*(1 - 3i). Then multiplying by e^(iπ/4) which is √2/2 + i√2/2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this. Let me try again:\n\n(√2 - 3√2 i) * (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)) \n\nSince cos(π/4) = sin(π/4) = √2/2, so:\n\n= (√2 - 3√2 i) * (√2/2 + i√2/2)\n\nMultiply them:\n\nFirst multiply √2 * √2/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nThen √2 * i√2/2 = i*(2)/2 = i\n\nThen -3√2 i * √2/2 = -3√2 * √2 /2 * i = -3*2/2 * i = -3i\n\nThen -3√2 i * i√2/2 = -3√2 * √2 /2 * i² = -3*2/2 * (-1) because i² = -1. So that is -3*1*(-1) = 3. \n\nAdding all terms: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. Correct. Then adding c: 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i. \n\nTherefore, w = 6 - 5i. \n\nBut let me check with another approach to make sure. Maybe converting to vectors?\n\nAlternatively, since rotation formulas can also be represented using rotation matrices. Since rotating a point (x, y) around another point (a, b) by angle θ can be done by translating (x - a, y - b), applying rotation matrix, then translating back.\n\nSo if I consider z as a point in the plane, coordinates (Re(z), Im(z)) which is (2 + √2, -3 - 3√2). Similarly, c is (2, -3). So vector from c to z is (√2, -3√2), as before. \n\nThe rotation matrix for π/4 is:\n\n[cosθ -sinθ]\n\n[sinθ cosθ]\n\nWhich for θ = π/4 is:\n\n[√2/2  -√2/2]\n\n[√2/2   √2/2]\n\nSo applying this matrix to the vector (√2, -3√2):\n\nFirst coordinate: √2/2 * √2 + (-√2/2) * (-3√2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: √2 * √2 / 2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nSecond term: (-√2/2) * (-3√2) = 3*(√2 * √2)/2 = 3*2/2 = 3\n\nTotal first coordinate: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSecond coordinate: √2/2 * √2 + √2/2 * (-3√2)\n\nFirst term: same as before, √2 * √2 /2 = 1\n\nSecond term: √2/2 * (-3√2) = -3*(√2 * √2)/2 = -3*2/2 = -3\n\nTotal second coordinate: 1 - 3 = -2\n\nTherefore, the rotated vector is (4, -2). Then translating back by adding c's coordinates (2, -3):\n\nNew x-coordinate: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nNew y-coordinate: -2 + (-3) = -5\n\nTherefore, the point is (6, -5), which corresponds to the complex number 6 - 5i. \n\nSame result! So that seems to confirm that w is indeed 6 - 5i. \n\nBut let me check once more with another method. Maybe using complex number properties.\n\nAlternatively, since rotating by π/4 is multiplying by e^{iπ/4}, but as we did before. But since we did two methods and got same answer, maybe it's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check magnitudes and angles?\n\nOriginal vector z - c is √2 - 3√2 i. Let me compute its magnitude. \n\n|z - c| = sqrt( (√2)^2 + (-3√2)^2 ) = sqrt(2 + 9*2) = sqrt(2 + 18) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). \n\nAfter rotation, magnitude should be same. Let's check |4 - 2i|: sqrt(4^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(16 + 4) = sqrt(20). Same. Good. \n\nOriginal angle of z - c: arctangent( (-3√2)/√2 ) = arctangent(-3). So angle is -arctan(3) or equivalently π - arctan(3) depending on quadrant. Since real part is positive, imaginary part is negative, so it's in fourth quadrant. \n\nAfter rotation by π/4 counter-clockwise, the new angle should be original angle + π/4. \n\nLet me check angle of 4 - 2i. The complex number 4 - 2i is in fourth quadrant. Its angle is arctangent(-2/4) = arctangent(-1/2). Let me see if original angle + π/4 equals this?\n\nOriginal angle: let me denote θ1 = arctan(-3). But since it's in fourth quadrant, θ1 = -arctan(3). Adding π/4: -arctan(3) + π/4. \n\nLet me compute tan(-arctan(3) + π/4). Using tan(A + B) formula? Wait, tan(π/4 - arctan(3)).\n\ntan(π/4 - arctan(3)) = [tan(π/4) - tan(arctan(3))]/[1 + tan(π/4) tan(arctan(3))] = [1 - 3]/[1 + 1*3] = (-2)/4 = -1/2. \n\nWhich is exactly the tangent of the angle of 4 - 2i. Therefore, the angle checks out. Therefore, the rotation is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct: w = 6 - 5i. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me check with actual numbers. Let me compute z, c, and then see if the rotation makes sense. \n\nOriginal z is (2 + √2, -3 - 3√2). Let me approximate the numerical values:\n\n√2 ≈ 1.4142, so:\n\nReal part of z: 2 + 1.4142 ≈ 3.4142\n\nImaginary part of z: -3 - 3*1.4142 ≈ -3 - 4.2426 ≈ -7.2426\n\nSo z ≈ (3.4142, -7.2426)\n\nc is (2, -3). \n\nSo vector from c to z is (3.4142 - 2, -7.2426 - (-3)) ≈ (1.4142, -4.2426). Which is approximately (√2, -3√2), since √2 ≈ 1.4142 and 3√2 ≈ 4.2426. Correct. \n\nRotating this vector by π/4 counter-clockwise. Let me recall that rotating (x, y) by π/4 CCW gives:\n\nx' = x*cosθ - y*sinθ\n\ny' = x*sinθ + y*cosθ\n\nWith θ = π/4, cosθ = sinθ ≈ 0.7071.\n\nSo x' ≈ 1.4142*0.7071 - (-4.2426)*0.7071 ≈ (1.4142 + 4.2426)*0.7071 ≈ 5.6568 * 0.7071 ≈ 4. \n\nSimilarly, y' ≈ 1.4142*0.7071 + (-4.2426)*0.7071 ≈ (1.4142 - 4.2426)*0.7071 ≈ (-2.8284)*0.7071 ≈ -2. \n\nTherefore, the rotated vector is approximately (4, -2), then adding back c's coordinates (2, -3) gives (4 + 2, -2 + (-3)) = (6, -5). Which is 6 - 5i. \n\nTherefore, numerical approximation also gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that w = 6 - 5i. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{6 - 5i}\n</think>"}
