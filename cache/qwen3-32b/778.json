Let me start by recalling what I know about weak acids and their dissociation in water.\n\nSulfurous acid, H2SO3, is a diprotic acid, which means it can donate two protons (H+ ions) in solution. However, since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate in water. The dissociation happens in two steps. \n\nFirst, the first dissociation step would be:\nH2SO3 ⇌ H+ + HSO3^-\n\nThen, the second dissociation step:\nHSO3^- ⇌ H+ + SO3^2-\n\nEach of these steps has its own acid dissociation constant, Ka. For most diprotic acids, the first dissociation constant (Ka1) is much larger than the second one (Ka2). This means that the first dissociation contributes more H+ ions than the second one. \n\nNow, I should remember the approximate values of Ka for sulfurous acid. If I recall correctly, Ka1 for H2SO3 is around 1.5 x 10^-2, and Ka2 is about 1.0 x 10^-7. These values might vary slightly depending on the source, but the key point is that Ka1 is significantly larger than Ka2. \n\nSince Ka1 is larger, the first dissociation produces more H+ and HSO3^- ions than the second dissociation produces H+ and SO3^2- ions. However, because both dissociations produce H+ ions, the concentration of H+ will be higher than either HSO3^- or SO3^2- individually, but the question is about the relative concentrations of the three species: H2SO3, HSO3^-, and SO3^2-.\n\nWait, the question is about the concentrations of three different ions. Wait, H2SO3 is the undissociated acid, not an ion. So the ions would be HSO3^- and SO3^2-, and also H+ ions. But the options given don't mention H+ concentration. The options are comparing [SO3^2-], [HSO3^-], and [H2SO3]. So H2SO3 is the undissociated molecule, but it's included in the options. So the question is about the relative concentrations of the undissociated acid, the first dissociated ion (HSO3^-), and the second dissociated ion (SO3^2-).\n\nSince H2SO3 is a weak acid, most of it remains in the undissociated form. However, some of it dissociates into HSO3^- and H+. Then, some of the HSO3^- further dissociates into SO3^2- and H+.\n\nGiven that Ka1 is much larger than Ka2, the first dissociation is more extensive than the second. Therefore, the concentration of HSO3^- should be higher than that of SO3^2-.\n\nBut how does the concentration of H2SO3 compare to HSO3^-? Since Ka1 is 1.5 x 10^-2, which is a small number but not extremely small. For example, if we consider a 0.1 M solution of H2SO3, the first dissociation would produce some H+ and HSO3^-.\n\nLet me try to do a rough estimation. Let's assume the initial concentration of H2SO3 is C. Then, the first dissociation is:\n\nH2SO3 ⇌ H+ + HSO3^-\n\nKa1 = [H+][HSO3^-]/[H2SO3] ≈ 1.5 x 10^-2.\n\nAssuming that the concentration of H+ and HSO3^- are both x, then:\n\nKa1 ≈ x^2 / (C - x) ≈ 1.5 x 10^-2.\n\nIf the initial concentration C is, say, 0.1 M, then solving for x would give us the concentration of HSO3^-.\n\nBut without exact numbers, maybe I can reason that since Ka1 is about 1.5% of 1 (since 1.5 x 10^-2 is 1.5%), the dissociation is not too high. So for a 0.1 M solution, maybe x is around sqrt(1.5 x 10^-2 * 0.1) ≈ sqrt(1.5 x 10^-3) ≈ 0.0387 M. But since x is not negligible compared to C (0.1), maybe the actual value is a bit less. Let's say approximately 0.03 M. Then [HSO3^-] ≈ 0.03 M, and [H2SO3] ≈ 0.1 - 0.03 = 0.07 M. So [H2SO3] is still higher than [HSO3^-].\n\nThen for the second dissociation:\n\nHSO3^- ⇌ H+ + SO3^2-\n\nKa2 = [H+][SO3^2-]/[HSO3^-] ≈ 1.0 x 10^-7.\n\nAssuming that [H+] from the first dissociation is approximately 0.03 M, then:\n\nKa2 ≈ (0.03)(y)/0.03 ≈ y ≈ 1.0 x 10^-7.\n\nTherefore, [SO3^2-] ≈ 1.0 x 10^-7 M.\n\nComparing the three concentrations:\n\n[H2SO3] ≈ 0.07 M,\n\n[HSO3^-] ≈ 0.03 M,\n\n[SO3^2-] ≈ 1e-7 M.\n\nSo the order would be [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-] > [SO3^2-], which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"the concentrations of three different ions in solution\". Wait, H2SO3 is not an ion. The ions would be HSO3^- and SO3^2-, and H+ as well. But the options don't mention H+; they are comparing H2SO3 (the undissociated acid), HSO3^-, and SO3^2-.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA: [SO3^2-] > [HSO3^-] > [H2SO3]\n\nB: [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-] > [SO3^2-]\n\nC: [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-] = [SO3^2-]\n\nD: [SO3^2-] = [HSO3^-] > [H2SO3]\n\nFrom my estimation, B is the correct one. But let me think again.\n\nAnother way to approach this is by considering the relative strengths of the acid and the conjugate bases. Since Ka1 is much larger than Ka2, the first dissociation is more extensive than the second. Therefore, the concentration of HSO3^- should be higher than that of SO3^2-.\n\nBut how about the concentration of H2SO3 compared to HSO3^-? Since Ka1 is about 1.5 x 10^-2, which is small but not extremely small. For a weak acid, typically, the undissociated form is more concentrated than the dissociated form. But the exact comparison depends on the value of Ka and the initial concentration.\n\nIf the initial concentration is high, then even with a relatively large Ka, the undissociated form might still be more concentrated. For example, if the initial concentration is 1 M, then even with a Ka of 1.5 x 10^-2, the dissociation would be less than 100%, so [H2SO3] would still be higher than [HSO3^-]. But if the initial concentration is very low, say 0.001 M, then maybe the dissociation would be more significant. However, the problem doesn't specify the concentration of the solution. It just says \"a solution of sulfurous acid\". So maybe we are to assume that it's a dilute solution where the initial concentration is not extremely high. \n\nBut since Ka1 is about 1.5 x 10^-2, which is 1.5%, then for a 0.1 M solution, the degree of dissociation is roughly sqrt(Ka/C) = sqrt(1.5e-2 / 0.1) = sqrt(0.15) ≈ 0.387 or 38.7%. Wait, no, that formula is for when Ka << C. Wait, the actual formula for degree of dissociation (α) is α = sqrt(Ka/C) when Ka << C. But in this case, if Ka is 1.5e-2 and C is 0.1, then Ka/C is 0.15, so sqrt(0.15) ≈ 0.387, which is about 38.7% dissociation. So in that case, [HSO3^-] would be 0.387 * 0.1 ≈ 0.0387 M, and [H2SO3] ≈ 0.1 - 0.0387 ≈ 0.0613 M. So indeed, [H2SO3] is still higher than [HSO3^-]. Therefore, B is still the correct order.\n\nBut what if the solution is more concentrated? Let's say 1 M. Then α = sqrt(1.5e-2 / 1) = sqrt(0.015) ≈ 0.122 or 12.2%. So [HSO3^-] ≈ 0.122 M, [H2SO3] ≈ 1 - 0.122 ≈ 0.878 M. Still, [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-].\n\nEven if the concentration is very low, say 0.001 M, then α = sqrt(1.5e-2 / 0.001) = sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87, which is greater than 1, so the assumption of α being small is invalid. In reality, the dissociation would be almost complete, but since it's a weak acid, it can't be fully dissociated. However, in such a low concentration, the concentration of H2SO3 would be negligible compared to HSO3^-, because most of it is dissociated. But in reality, even with a very low concentration, the undissociated H2SO3 might still be present in some amount. However, the problem doesn't specify the concentration, so I think we are to assume a typical moderate concentration where the undissociated form is still more concentrated than the first dissociated form.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-] > [SO3^2-], which is option B.\n\nLet me also check the other options:\n\nOption A: [SO3^2-] > [HSO3^-] > [H2SO3]. This would require that the second dissociation is more extensive than the first, which contradicts the fact that Ka1 > Ka2. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption C: [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-] = [SO3^2-]. For the concentrations of HSO3^- and SO3^2- to be equal, the second dissociation would have to produce as much as the first one, which isn't the case here. Since Ka2 is much smaller, [SO3^2-] should be much less than [HSO3^-]. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: [SO3^2-] = [HSO3^-] > [H2SO3]. Again, this would require that the second dissociation is as significant as the first, which isn't true. Also, H2SO3 being less than both would mean that the first dissociation is almost complete, which would only happen at very low concentrations, but even then, the second dissociation is much less. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n</think>"}
