Hmm, let me think. First, maybe I can simplify this equation by substituting a variable for the fourth root of x. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set $y = \\sqrt[4]{x}$. Then, since the fourth root of x is y, that means $x = y^4$. So substituting into the equation, I get:\n\n$y = \\frac{12}{7 - y}$\n\nAlright, so now I have an equation in terms of y. This looks easier to handle. Let me solve for y. To get rid of the denominator, I can multiply both sides by $7 - y$:\n\n$y(7 - y) = 12$\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n$7y - y^2 = 12$\n\nHmm, let me rearrange this equation to form a quadratic. Let me bring all terms to one side:\n\n$-y^2 + 7y - 12 = 0$\n\nIt might be easier if the coefficient of $y^2$ is positive, so I can multiply both sides by -1:\n\n$y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0$\n\nOkay, so now I have a quadratic equation: $y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0$. Let me try to factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 12 and add up to -7. Wait, actually, since the middle term is -7y and the constant term is +12, I need two numbers that multiply to +12 and add up to -7. But since the product is positive and the sum is negative, both numbers must be negative. Let me think... factors of 12: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4. If I take -3 and -4, their product is 12 and their sum is -7. Perfect!\n\nSo the factored form is:\n\n$(y - 3)(y - 4) = 0$\n\nWait, hold on. If the factors are -3 and -4, then actually the factors should be (y - 3)(y - 4) because if you set each factor to zero, you get y = 3 and y = 4. Let me check by expanding:\n\n$(y - 3)(y - 4) = y^2 - 4y - 3y + 12 = y^2 -7y + 12$. Yes, that's correct. So the solutions are y = 3 and y = 4.\n\nSo, going back to our substitution, $y = \\sqrt[4]{x}$, so we have two solutions for y: 3 and 4. Therefore, we need to solve for x in each case.\n\nFirst, when y = 3:\n\n$\\sqrt[4]{x} = 3$\n\nTo solve for x, raise both sides to the 4th power:\n\n$x = 3^4 = 81$\n\nSecond, when y = 4:\n\n$\\sqrt[4]{x} = 4$\n\nSimilarly, raise both sides to the 4th power:\n\n$x = 4^4 = 256$\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x are 81 and 256. The question asks for the sum of the solutions, so we add them together:\n\n81 + 256 = 337\n\nWait, let me check my calculations here. 80 + 250 is 330, and 1 + 6 is 7, so total is 337. That seems correct.\n\nBut hold on, I need to make sure that these solutions are valid in the original equation. Sometimes when you manipulate equations, especially involving radicals and multiplying both sides by expressions, you might introduce extraneous solutions. Let me check both solutions in the original equation.\n\nFirst, check x = 81:\n\nCompute $\\sqrt[4]{81}$. Since 3^4 = 81, this is 3. Then compute the right-hand side: 12 divided by (7 - sqrt[4]{81}) = 12 / (7 - 3) = 12 / 4 = 3. So 3 = 3, which is true. Good.\n\nNow check x = 256:\n\n$\\sqrt[4]{256}$ is 4, since 4^4 = 256. Then the right-hand side is 12 / (7 - 4) = 12 / 3 = 4. So 4 = 4, which is also true. Perfect. Both solutions are valid.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the solutions is 81 + 256 = 337. Wait, but let me just think again if there could be more solutions. The original equation was transformed into a quadratic in y, which had two solutions. Since the substitution was one-to-one (because fourth root is a function, and for real numbers, fourth roots are defined for non-negative numbers, and since x must be non-negative here). Therefore, each y corresponds to exactly one x, and since both y solutions are valid (they don't make the denominator zero in the original equation; 7 - y when y is 3 or 4 is 4 or 3, neither of which is zero), so there are exactly two solutions, 81 and 256, sum 337. \n\nBut let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe to confirm. Alternatively, maybe we could have cross-multiplied earlier, but that's essentially what I did. Let me check if there's any step where I could have made a mistake.\n\nOriginal equation: $\\sqrt[4]{x} = \\frac{12}{7 - \\sqrt[4]{x}}$. Let me denote y again as before, so y = 12/(7 - y). Multiply both sides by (7 - y): y(7 - y) = 12. Which is 7y - y² = 12. Then rearranged to y² -7y +12 = 0. Factored to (y - 3)(y - 4) = 0. All steps look correct. Therefore, solutions y=3 and y=4. Then x = y^4. So 3^4 is 81, 4^4 is 256. Sum is 337. Seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to think about this equation as a proportion or something else? Let me think. Suppose I let z = sqrt[4]{x}, same as y before. Then equation is z = 12/(7 - z). Then cross multiplying gives z(7 - z) = 12, which is same as before. So same quadratic. So same solutions. So I think that's thorough.\n\nAnother check: Maybe think about the quadratic equation. For quadratic equation $y^2 -7y +12 = 0$, the sum of the roots is 7, by Vieta's formula. Since the quadratic is y² - (sum)y + (product) = 0. Therefore, sum of roots is 7. Therefore, the sum of y's is 7. But since each y corresponds to x = y^4, but the sum of x's is not directly related unless we can find a relationship. However, since we have two y's, 3 and 4, sum of y's is 7, but sum of x's is 3^4 + 4^4. However, maybe there's a way to compute this sum without calculating each term? Not sure. But maybe that's complicating. Since we already have the individual y's, it's straightforward to compute their fourth powers and add them. \n\nBut just for curiosity, is there a way to find the sum of x's using Vieta's formula or something else? Let me think. If we have y1 and y2 as roots of the quadratic, then x1 = (y1)^4 and x2 = (y2)^4. So sum x1 + x2 = (y1)^4 + (y2)^4. Is there a way to compute this using the known sum and product of y1 and y2?\n\nWe know from Vieta's formula that y1 + y2 = 7 and y1*y2 = 12. Let me compute (y1)^4 + (y2)^4. There is a formula for that. Let me recall:\n\n(y1^4 + y2^4) can be expressed in terms of (y1^2)^2 + (y2^2)^2, which can be expanded further. Alternatively, using the identity:\n\ny1^4 + y2^4 = (y1^2 + y2^2)^2 - 2(y1 y2)^2.\n\nAnd y1^2 + y2^2 can be expressed as (y1 + y2)^2 - 2 y1 y2.\n\nSo let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, compute y1 + y2 = 7, y1 y2 = 12.\n\nCompute y1^2 + y2^2 = (y1 + y2)^2 - 2 y1 y2 = 7^2 - 2*12 = 49 - 24 = 25.\n\nThen, y1^4 + y2^4 = (y1^2 + y2^2)^2 - 2 (y1 y2)^2 = 25^2 - 2*(12)^2 = 625 - 2*144 = 625 - 288 = 337. \n\nOh! That's exactly the same result as before. Therefore, the sum of the solutions x1 + x2 is 337. So that's a more algebraic way to get the same answer without computing 3^4 and 4^4 individually. Interesting. So that's a good check. Since Vieta gives us the sum and product of y's, we can use those to compute the sum of x's. \n\nThis also shows that even if we didn't know the individual y's, we could still compute the required sum. But in this case, since the numbers are small, calculating directly is straightforward. However, this method is more elegant and shows deeper understanding. \n\nSo, either way, whether by directly computing 81 + 256 or by using the identity with Vieta's formula, we arrive at 337. Therefore, the answer is 337.\n\nBut just to recap the entire process to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations:\n\n1. Let $y = \\sqrt[4]{x}$, so equation becomes $y = 12/(7 - y)$.\n2. Multiply both sides by $7 - y$ to get $y(7 - y) = 12$.\n3. Expand and rearrange to quadratic equation $y^2 -7y +12 = 0$.\n4. Factor quadratic to get roots y = 3 and y = 4.\n5. Convert back to x by raising to 4th power: 3^4 = 81, 4^4 = 256.\n6. Add solutions: 81 + 256 = 337.\n7. Verify solutions in original equation to ensure they aren't extraneous.\n8. Confirm using Vieta's formula that sum of x's is 337.\n\nAll steps check out. Therefore, confident that 337 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the solutions is \\boxed{337}.\n</think>"}
