This is often modeled using the **gravitational focusing length**, derived from equating the gravitational potential energy with the kinetic energy of the system.\n\nFor two stars of mass $ M $, the critical distance $ d $ at which their gravitational interaction becomes significant is approximately:\n\n$$\nd \\propto \\frac{G M}{v^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,\n- $ M $ is the mass of a star,\n- $ v $ is the relative velocity between the stars.\n\nIf we want the **same critical distance** for two different groups of stars, the following condition must hold:\n\n$$\n\\frac{G M_1}{v_1^2} = \\frac{G M_2}{v_2^2}\n$$\n\nCanceling $ G $, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{M_1}{v_1^2} = \\frac{M_2}{v_2^2}\n$$\n\nSolving for $ v_2 $:\n\n$$\nv_2 = v_1 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{M_2}{M_1}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Given Values**\n\n- $ M_1 = 0.5 $ solar masses  \n- $ v_1 = 22 $ km/s  \n- $ M_2 = 0.3 $ solar masses\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n$$\nv_2 = 22 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{0.3}{0.5}} = 22 \\cdot \\sqrt{0.6} \\approx 22 \\cdot 0.7746 \\approx 17.04 \\text{ km/s}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nTo maintain the **same critical distance of 1.5 AU**, the stars in **Group_2**, which are less massive than those in Group_1, must move **slower** than the 22 km/s of Group_1.

Let's start by understanding what the critical distance means here. The problem says it's a distance where there's a significant impact on the orbits or velocity of the stars during a flyby. I think this relates to gravitational interactions between stars.\n\nIn Group_1, all stars have a mass of 0.5 solar masses and velocities of 22 km/s. Group_2 has stars with 0.3 solar masses each. The question is asking what velocity the stars in Group_2 should have to achieve the same critical distance of 1.5 AU.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to use the concept of the gravitational focusing or something related to the gravitational deflection of stars passing by each other. I recall that when two stars pass by each other, the distance of closest approach (which might be the critical distance here) depends on their relative velocity and their masses. There's a formula that relates the impact parameter (distance of closest approach) to the relative velocity and the gravitational force between them.\n\nI think the formula for the critical distance might involve the gravitational parameter. Let me think. In gravitational interactions, the deflection angle depends on the impact parameter, the relative velocity, and the masses involved. However, the problem is about the critical distance, so maybe we can use the concept of the gravitational focusing or the distance at which the gravitational force is significant enough to alter the orbits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of the encounter time or the time it takes for two stars to pass each other, considering their velocity and the critical distance. But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is to use the virial theorem or something related to the kinetic and potential energy.\n\nWait, another thought: the critical distance might be related to the gravitational focusing length, which is given by something like G M / v², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star, and v is the relative velocity. If two stars pass each other at a distance of the order of this focusing length, their gravitational interaction is significant.\n\nSo, if the critical distance d is set to be equal to G M / v², then solving for v would give v = sqrt(G M / d). But since the critical distance d is the same for both groups (1.5 AU), then for Group_1 and Group_2, we can set up the equation such that d is the same, so the ratio of velocities would depend on the ratio of the masses.\n\nWait, let me write this down:\n\nFor Group_1: d = G * M1 / v1²\n\nFor Group_2: d = G * M2 / v2²\n\nSince d is the same for both, we can set them equal:\n\nG * M1 / v1² = G * M2 / v2²\n\nThe G cancels out:\n\nM1 / v1² = M2 / v2²\n\nThen solving for v2:\n\nv2² = (M2 / M1) * v1²\n\nWait, no. Wait, if M1 / v1² = M2 / v2², then rearranged:\n\nv2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nWait, no, solving for v2²:\n\nv2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nWait, let me check algebra again.\n\nFrom M1 / v1² = M2 / v2²,\n\nCross-multiplying gives M1 * v2² = M2 * v1²\n\nTherefore,\n\nv2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nWait no, wait:\n\nIf M1 * v2² = M2 * v1²,\n\nThen v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nNo, that would be if it were M1 * v2² = M2 * v1², then v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nWait, no. Let me write it again.\n\nStarting from:\n\nM1 / v1² = M2 / v2²\n\nMultiply both sides by v1² * v2²:\n\nM1 * v2² = M2 * v1²\n\nTherefore,\n\nv2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nFrom M1 * v2² = M2 * v1²,\n\nThen v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nNo, because if you divide both sides by M1, you get v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me do the algebra again.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nM1 / v1² = M2 / v2²\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nM1 * v2² = M2 * v1²\n\nTherefore,\n\nv2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nNo, wait:\n\nIf M1 * v2² = M2 * v1²,\n\nThen v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² ?\n\nYes, because you divide both sides by M1:\n\nv2² = (M2 / M1) * v1²\n\nWait, but that would mean that if M2 is smaller than M1, then v2 would be smaller than v1? Let me check with the numbers given.\n\nGroup_1 has M1 = 0.5 solar masses, v1 = 22 km/s.\n\nGroup_2 has M2 = 0.3 solar masses, and we need to find v2.\n\nAccording to the formula above, v2 = sqrt( (M2 / M1) ) * v1\n\nSo sqrt(0.3 / 0.5) * 22 = sqrt(0.6) * 22 ≈ 0.7746 * 22 ≈ 17.04 km/s. Which is close to option B: ~17 km/s. So that would be the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure that the formula is correct. The assumption here is that the critical distance is given by d = G M / v². If that's the case, then the above derivation holds. But why is that the case?\n\nLet me think again. The critical distance might be related to the gravitational focusing length. In gravitational focusing, the impact parameter that leads to a significant deflection is roughly the distance where the gravitational potential energy is comparable to the kinetic energy. The gravitational potential energy is -G M m / d, and the kinetic energy is ½ m v². Setting them equal (in magnitude):\n\nG M m / d ≈ ½ m v² → d ≈ 2 G M / v².\n\nBut maybe in the problem, they simplified it to d = G M / v². So if that's the case, then the critical distance is proportional to M / v². Therefore, if you want the same d for both groups, then M1 / v1² = M2 / v2², leading to v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1).\n\nWait, but according to the derivation earlier, v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1). Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nFrom M1 / v1² = M2 / v2² → v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² → v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me re-express:\n\nIf M1 / v1² = M2 / v2² → v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² → v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1). Wait, no. Wait, if you have:\n\nv2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² → v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1). But that would mean if M2 is smaller than M1, then v2 is smaller than v1. In our case, M2 is 0.3, M1 is 0.5, so sqrt(0.3/0.5) is sqrt(0.6) ≈ 0.7746. So v2 ≈ 22 * 0.7746 ≈ 17.04 km/s. Which is option B.\n\nBut let me check again the derivation. Suppose the critical distance is determined by equating the gravitational potential energy to the kinetic energy. Let me do that properly.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a star is (1/2) m v², where m is the mass of the star. The gravitational potential energy between two stars at distance d is - G M m / d, where M is the mass of the other star. For the interaction to be significant, the potential energy should be comparable to the kinetic energy. Let's take the magnitude:\n\nG M m / d ≈ (1/2) m v² → d ≈ 2 G M / v².\n\nAssuming that the two stars have mass M and m, but if we're considering a single star's perspective, maybe M is the mass of the other star. However, in the problem, all stars in Group_1 have the same mass, 0.5 solar masses, and same for Group_2. So in this case, M would be the mass of the other star, which is same as the mass of the star in question. Wait, but in the potential energy, it's G M m / d. If both stars have mass M, then it's G M² / d. But when equating to kinetic energy (1/2) m v², where m is the mass of the star. So if m is the mass of the star, and the other star has mass M, then:\n\nG M m / d ≈ (1/2) m v² → G M / d ≈ (1/2) v² → d ≈ 2 G M / v².\n\nSo the critical distance d is approximately 2 G M / v². Therefore, if we want d to be the same for both groups, then:\n\nFor Group_1: d = 2 G M1 / v1²\n\nFor Group_2: d = 2 G M2 / v2²\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n2 G M1 / v1² = 2 G M2 / v2² → M1 / v1² = M2 / v2² → v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² → v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1)\n\nWait, no! Wait, solving for v2²:\n\nFrom M1 / v1² = M2 / v2² → v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² → v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1). Wait, that can't be right. Because if you have M1 / v1² = M2 / v2², then cross multiplying gives M1 * v2² = M2 * v1² → v2² = (M2 / M1) * v1² → v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1). Wait, but if M2 is smaller than M1, then sqrt(M2/M1) is less than 1, so v2 is smaller than v1. In our case, M2 is 0.3, M1 is 0.5, so sqrt(0.3/0.5) is sqrt(0.6) ≈ 0.7746. So v2 = 22 * 0.7746 ≈ 17.04 km/s. Which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me check with numbers. Suppose in Group_1, d is 1.5 AU. If we have a higher mass, then for the same d, the velocity would need to be higher? Or lower?\n\nIf a star is more massive, then for the same velocity, the critical distance would be larger. Because d ∝ M / v². So if M increases, d increases. Therefore, if you want the same d with a smaller mass, you need a lower velocity? Wait, no. Wait, if M is smaller, to keep d the same, you need to adjust v. Let me think.\n\nSuppose M1 is larger than M2. To keep d the same, since d ∝ M / v², if you decrease M, you need to decrease v² proportionally. So if M decreases by a factor of 0.3 / 0.5 = 0.6, then v² must also decrease by a factor of 0.6, so v decreases by sqrt(0.6). Which is what we calculated. So the velocity should be lower in Group_2 compared to Group_1. Since 0.3 is less than 0.5, so v2 is less than v1. Which makes sense because a less massive star would need a lower velocity to have the same critical distance. Because the gravitational interaction is weaker for a less massive star, so to have the same effect (same critical distance), you need a lower velocity to make the interaction more significant.\n\nSo according to this, the answer would be approximately 17 km/s, which is option B.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. For example, considering the relative velocity between two stars. In the derivation above, I assumed that the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², where v is the velocity of the star. However, in reality, when two stars pass by each other, the relative velocity is important. If they're moving in opposite directions, the relative velocity would be twice the individual velocity. But the problem states that all stars have the same velocity. Wait, the problem says \"assuming the same velocity for all stars\". So if all stars in Group_2 have the same velocity, then the relative velocity between two stars would be zero? That can't be right. Wait, no. If all stars are moving randomly with velocity v, then the relative velocity between two stars would depend on their direction. But in the problem, it's mentioned that the velocities are random. For Group_1, the velocities are 22 km/s. So perhaps the average relative velocity is considered.\n\nBut maybe in the derivation above, we can consider the relative velocity. Let me think. The relative velocity between two stars moving with velocity v in random directions would have an average relative speed of sqrt(2) v. But maybe in the problem, they simplify it by using the velocity of the stars as the relative velocity. Because the problem says \"assuming the same velocity for all stars\", which might mean that the relative velocity is considered as v. Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the velocity is the root-mean-square velocity, and the derivation is based on that.\n\nBut regardless of that, the formula we used earlier seems to give the correct answer based on the given options. Let me check again with the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\nM1 = 0.5 Msun\n\nv1 = 22 km/s\n\nM2 = 0.3 Msun\n\nFind v2 such that d is same.\n\nFrom the formula d = k * M / v², where k is a constant (including G and factors like 2 from the energy consideration), so for same d, M1 / v1² = M2 / v2² → v2 = v1 * sqrt(M2 / M1)\n\nSo v2 = 22 * sqrt(0.3 / 0.5) = 22 * sqrt(0.6) ≈ 22 * 0.7746 ≈ 17.04 km/s. Which is approximately 17 km/s. So the answer is B.\n\nBut let me check if there's a mistake in the formula. Suppose instead the critical distance is determined by something else, like the time of closest approach or something else. For example, the time it takes for two stars to pass each other at distance d with velocity v is t = d / v. The gravitational force at distance d is F = G M m / d². The acceleration is a = F / m = G M / d². The change in velocity would be a * t = (G M / d²) * (d / v) ) = G M / (d v). For this to be significant, maybe the change in velocity should be comparable to the original velocity. So Δv ≈ v → G M / (d v) ≈ v → G M / d ≈ v² → d ≈ G M / v². Which is the same as before. So the critical distance d is approximately G M / v². Therefore, the same derivation applies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: ~17 km/s.\n</think>"}
