So, there's a rectangular metal loop that's completely conductive. It has sides a and b, mass M, and self-inductance L. It's moving into a region with a uniform magnetic field B₀, starting from a region where the magnetic field is zero. The initial velocity is v₀ along the longer side, which is b, since b > a. The magnetic field direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. I need to find the velocity as a function of time and the distance it moves.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a conductor moves through a magnetic field, induced currents can occur due to changes in magnetic flux. Since the loop is entering the magnetic field, the flux through the loop is increasing, which should induce a current. But the loop has self-inductance L, so the changing current will also produce a back EMF. Hmm, so this is a problem involving electromagnetic induction with self-inductance.\n\nLet me start by recalling Faraday's Law. The induced EMF in a loop is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. The magnetic flux Φ is given by B * A, where A is the area of the loop inside the magnetic field. But since the loop is moving into the field, the area inside the field is changing over time.\n\nLet me visualize the loop moving along the direction of the longer side, which is length b. So, the loop is moving along the direction of length b, and the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane. Let me assume that the loop is moving along the x-axis, and the magnetic field is in the z-direction. The loop is entering the magnetic field region, which I can imagine as a half-plane. So, as the loop moves into the field, the portion of the loop inside the field increases.\n\nLet me define some variables. Let me say that at time t, the loop has moved a distance x(t) into the magnetic field region. The velocity is v(t) = dx/dt. The initial velocity is v₀, so at t=0, x(0)=0 and v(0)=v₀.\n\nNow, the area of the loop inside the magnetic field depends on how much of it is in the field. The loop has length b along the direction of motion. So, if the entire loop is not yet in the field, the area inside the field would be a * x(t), but wait, no. Wait, the loop's dimensions are a and b. If it's moving along the length b, then the side of length b is moving into the field. So, if the loop is partially in the field, the length inside the field is x(t), so the area would be x(t) * a. But the total length of the side is b. So, until x(t) reaches b, the area is increasing linearly with x(t). Once x(t) ≥ b, the entire loop is in the field, and the flux is constant. But since the loop is moving with velocity v(t), which is going to decrease due to the induced current, maybe the loop never fully enters the field? Or maybe we need to consider both cases?\n\nBut the problem says \"enters a uniform magnetic field\", so maybe we can assume that the loop is only partially entering the field and the problem is about the time when it's still entering, so x(t) < b. However, since the velocity is going to decrease, maybe eventually the loop stops? Or maybe the motion continues? The problem doesn't specify the duration, so perhaps we need to find v(t) and S(t) while the loop is still entering the field. But maybe we need to consider the entire motion. Hmm.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step. Let's first assume that the loop is partially entering the field, so x(t) < b. Then the flux through the loop is Φ = B₀ * a * x(t). The rate of change of flux is dΦ/dt = B₀ * a * dx/dt = B₀ * a * v(t). According to Faraday's Law, the induced EMF is -dΦ/dt, so EMF = -B₀ a v(t). But since the loop is completely conductive, there's no resistance? Wait, the problem says \"completely conductive\", which might mean zero resistance? But if there's self-inductance L, then even with zero resistance, the current will be affected by the self-inductance. So, the induced EMF will drive a current, but the self-inductance will oppose the change in current.\n\nSo, let me model the circuit. The loop has self-inductance L and zero resistance. The induced EMF is -dΦ/dt. The equation for the circuit would be L * dI/dt + EMF = 0? Wait, the induced EMF is the same as the voltage around the loop. In a circuit with inductance and no resistance, the equation is L * dI/dt = -EMF. Wait, Faraday's Law says that the EMF is equal to the induced voltage, which is L * dI/dt? Wait, let me recall:\n\nThe induced EMF is equal to the electromotive force around the loop, which is also equal to L * dI/dt if there's no resistance. Wait, no. In general, for a circuit with inductance and resistance, the equation is EMF = -L dI/dt - IR. But if R = 0, then EMF = -L dI/dt. Therefore, rearranged, L dI/dt = -EMF. Therefore, L dI/dt = B₀ a v(t). Wait, because EMF was -B₀ a v(t). Therefore, L dI/dt = B₀ a v(t). So, that's the equation for the current.\n\nBut how does the current relate to the force on the loop? The current I will produce a magnetic force opposing the motion, according to Lenz's Law. The force on the loop is due to the interaction between the induced current and the magnetic field. Let's think about that.\n\nThe loop has sides of length a and b. The current is circulating around the loop. When part of the loop is in the magnetic field, the sides of the loop that are in the field will experience forces. Specifically, the side that is entering the field (the leading edge) and the side that is already in the field (if any). Wait, when the loop is partially in the field, there are two sides of length a, one in the field and one not? Wait, no. The loop is a rectangle. If it's moving along the direction of length b, then the sides of length a are perpendicular to the motion. So, when the loop is moving into the field, at any time, one side of length a is in the field and the opposite side is in the zero field? Or maybe both sides are in the field? Wait, no. The magnetic field is uniform in the region where it's present. So, if the loop is partially in the field, then only part of the loop is in the field. Let me think again.\n\nImagine the loop is moving along the x-axis. Let me assume that the magnetic field is in the region x ≥ 0. At time t, the loop has moved a distance x(t) into the field. The loop has length b along the x-axis. Therefore, the portion from x=0 to x=x(t) is in the field? No, actually, if the loop is moving along its length b, then the entire loop is a rectangle. Suppose at t=0, the leading edge (the front of the loop) is just entering the field. So, as it moves forward, more of the loop enters the field. Therefore, the length of the loop inside the field is x(t), so the area is a * x(t). The sides of the loop that are vertical (length a) are either in the field or not. The left side (the one entering) is in the field, and the right side (the one that hasn't entered yet) is not. Wait, but the loop is a closed loop. So, when part of it is in the field, the current will flow in such a way to oppose the change in flux. The induced current will create a magnetic field opposing the increase in flux, meaning it will try to push the loop back.\n\nBut to find the force, we can think about the Lorentz force on the current-carrying sides of the loop. The sides of length a that are in the field will experience a force. Let me consider the current direction. Suppose the flux is increasing into the page (assuming B₀ is into the page). The induced current will be such to create a magnetic field opposing that, so out of the page. Therefore, using the right-hand rule, the induced current would be clockwise or counterclockwise? If B₀ is into the page, and we want to oppose the increase, the induced B should be out of the page. So, using right-hand rule for a loop, if the current is clockwise, the magnetic field inside the loop would be into the page; counterclockwise would be out of the page. Therefore, to oppose the increasing flux into the page, the induced current should be counterclockwise. Wait, no. Wait, if the flux is increasing into the page, the induced current will create a field opposing that, so out of the page. Therefore, using right-hand rule, if you want the field out of the page, the current should be counterclockwise. Therefore, the induced current is counterclockwise.\n\nNow, considering the forces on the sides of the loop. The sides of length a are vertical. The left side (entering the field) is in the field, and the right side is not. The current is going up on the left side and down on the right side? Wait, if the current is counterclockwise, then in the left side (which is in the field), the current is going up, and in the right side (not in the field), the current is going down. The magnetic force on a current-carrying wire is F = I * L × B. So, on the left side, the current is up, B is into the page. Using the right-hand rule, the force is to the left. On the right side, since there's no B field, there's no force. The other sides of the loop (the top and bottom, length b) are moving through the field? Wait, no. The top and bottom are of length b, but they are moving along the direction of motion. However, since the loop is moving into the field, only the sides perpendicular to the motion (the vertical sides) are in the field. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the top and bottom of the loop are of length b. If the loop is moving along the x-axis, and the magnetic field is in the z-direction, then the top and bottom sides are moving in the x-direction. However, if they are in the field, they would experience a motional EMF. But since we already considered the flux change, maybe we need to think about this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total force on the loop can be calculated using F = I * (L × B), but considering the entire loop? Wait, but the loop is partially in the field. The current is flowing around the loop. The left side is in the field, so the current there experiences a force. The right side is not in the field, so no force. The top and bottom sides are in the field? Wait, if the entire loop is in the field, then yes, but if only part is in the field, then only the left vertical side is in the field. Wait, maybe not. If the loop is moving along its length b, then as it enters the field, the horizontal sides (length b) are partially in the field? No, the horizontal sides are length b, which is the direction of motion. Wait, perhaps I need to better define the orientation.\n\nLet me define the loop as follows: Let’s say the rectangle has length b along the x-axis and length a along the y-axis. The loop is moving along the x-axis with velocity v(t). The magnetic field is in the z-direction (perpendicular to the plane). So, when the loop is moving into the field region (say, x ≥ 0), the part of the loop with x between 0 and x(t) is in the field. Therefore, the vertical sides (along y-axis) at x=0 and x=x(t) are in the field? No, the vertical sides are at x positions. Wait, if the loop is moving along the x-axis, then the vertical sides (length a) are at positions x=position of left side and x=position of left side + b. Wait, maybe I need to think of the loop as a rectangle from x = x_loop(t) to x = x_loop(t) + b, and y from 0 to a. The magnetic field is present for x ≥ 0. Therefore, the overlap between the loop and the magnetic field region is from x = max(x_loop(t), 0) to x = min(x_loop(t) + b, ...). Assuming the field is only on one side, say for x ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, if the loop is entering the field, then initially x_loop(t) < 0, and as it moves, x_loop(t) increases. But maybe it's simpler to take x(t) as the position of the leading edge? Or maybe take x(t) as the amount that has entered. Let me define x(t) as the length of the loop that is inside the magnetic field. So when x(t) = 0, none is inside; when x(t) = b, the entire loop is inside.\n\nTherefore, the flux is Φ = B₀ * a * x(t). Then, the induced EMF is -dΦ/dt = -B₀ a v(t). The current in the loop is related to this EMF and the self-inductance. Since there's no resistance, the equation is L * dI/dt = -EMF = B₀ a v(t). So, L * dI/dt = B₀ a v(t).\n\nBut we also need to relate the current I to the force on the loop. The force will be due to the interaction between the current and the magnetic field. Let me think about this. The current is going around the loop. In the part of the loop that is in the field, the current will experience a force. The vertical sides are in the field? If x(t) is the length inside the field, then the vertical sides... Wait, if the loop is partially in the field, then there is a vertical side on the edge of the field. Wait, maybe the horizontal sides? No, the horizontal sides are along the direction of motion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the concept of motional EMF. But since we already used Faraday's Law, maybe we can find the force another way. Alternatively, consider that the power dissipated (even though there's no resistance) is related to the work done against the magnetic force.\n\nAlternatively, since we have an expression for the current, perhaps we can compute the magnetic force on the loop. Let me consider that the current I is circulating around the loop. In the region where the loop is in the magnetic field, the current will experience a force. Let me imagine that the current is going up on the left side (which is in the field) and down on the right side (which is not in the field). The force on the left side is F = I * L × B, where L is the length vector of the side. The left side has length a upwards, so vector L is in the +y direction. The magnetic field is in the +z direction. The cross product L × B is in the +y × +z = +x direction. Therefore, the force on the left side is I * a * B₀ in the +x direction. Wait, but the current is going up (positive y) and B is into the page (positive z?), assuming standard right-hand coordinate system. Wait, if B is in the z-direction, and the current is in the y-direction, then the force is in the x-direction. Specifically, F = I * L × B. Let me use unit vectors. Let’s define coordinates: x-axis along motion, y-axis vertical, z-axis perpendicular (B is in z-direction). Current on left side is in +y direction. B is in +z direction. Then, F direction is y × z = +x. So, force is in +x direction? But that would mean the force is in the direction of motion, which contradicts Lenz's law. Wait, that can't be right. Because the induced current should create a force opposing the motion.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the direction of current. Earlier, I thought the induced current is counterclockwise to oppose the increasing flux. If the flux is increasing into the page, the induced current is counterclockwise. So, looking from above, counterclockwise. So, on the left side (which is entering the field), the current is going up (positive y), and on the right side, it's going down (negative y). Then, on the left side, with current up and B into the page (positive z), the force is I * L × B. Let me do the cross product again. If current is in +y, B is in +z, then F direction is +y × +z = +x. So, force is to the right, same direction as motion. But that would mean the force is helping the motion, which violates Lenz's law. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I have the direction of the induced EMF wrong. Earlier, I said EMF = -dΦ/dt. If the flux is increasing (positive dΦ/dt), then EMF is negative. But how does that translate to current direction?\n\nLet me think again. The flux is increasing into the page, so according to Lenz's law, the induced current should create a field opposing that, i.e., out of the page. To create a field out of the page, the current must be counterclockwise. So, if I look at the loop from above, counterclockwise. So, on the left side (entering the field), the current is going up, on the right side, down. Then, on the left side, the force is to the right. But that would mean the magnetic force is in the direction of motion. That can't be right. It should oppose the motion. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, the current is induced due to the changing flux. The force on the current-carrying conductor in the magnetic field should oppose the motion. Maybe I need to consider the entire loop? Wait, but only part of the loop is in the magnetic field. The left side is in the field, current up, force to the right. The right side is not in the field, so no force. The top and bottom sides? The top and bottom sides are of length b, moving through the field? Wait, if the top and bottom are in the field, then they would have a motional EMF. But since we already considered the flux change, maybe we need to think about this differently. Alternatively, maybe there's another contribution to the force.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the formula for the magnetic force on a current loop in a non-uniform field? But the field here is uniform in the region where it exists. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the induced current creates a magnetic force that opposes the motion. If the force is to the right, same as motion, that would mean the loop is being accelerated, which is impossible because the induced current should oppose the change. Therefore, my previous analysis must be wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the cross product again. Let me use the right-hand rule for the force on a current-carrying wire. The current is going up on the left side (in +y direction), and the magnetic field is into the page (which is -z if we consider standard coordinates where +z is out of the page). Wait, maybe I messed up the direction of B. If B is into the page, then in coordinates, that's -z direction. Let me define +z as out of the page. Then B₀ is into the page, so B = -B₀ \\hat{z}.\n\nCurrent is in +y direction on the left side. The force is I * L × B. Let me write vectors:\n\nCurrent direction: +y.\n\nLength vector L is in +y direction (upwards), magnitude a.\n\nB is -B₀ \\hat{z}.\n\nCross product \\hat{y} × (-\\hat{z}) = - (\\hat{y} × \\hat{z}) = -\\hat{x}.\n\nTherefore, the force is I * a * (-\\hat{x}), which is to the left. Ah! There we go. So the force is opposite to the direction of motion. That makes sense. Earlier, I had a sign error in the direction of B. So the force on the left side is to the left, opposing the motion. Great, that aligns with Lenz's law.\n\nTherefore, the total magnetic force on the loop is F = -I a B₀ \\hat{x}. Since only the left side is in the field, and the current there is I, the total force is F = -I a B₀. So, Newton's second law gives F = M a, where a is acceleration. But here, acceleration is dv/dt. So:\n\nM dv/dt = -I a B₀.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) From the circuit: L dI/dt = B₀ a v(t).\n\n2) From Newton's law: M dv/dt = -I a B₀.\n\nSo we have a system of two differential equations. Let me write them:\n\nEquation (1): L dI/dt = B₀ a v(t).\n\nEquation (2): M dv/dt = -B₀ a I(t).\n\nThis looks like a coupled system of linear differential equations. Let me try to solve them.\n\nLet me take the derivative of equation (2) with respect to time:\n\nM d²v/dt² = -B₀ a dI/dt.\n\nBut from equation (1), dI/dt = (B₀ a / L) v(t). Substitute into above:\n\nM d²v/dt² = -B₀ a * (B₀ a / L) v(t).\n\nTherefore:\n\nM d²v/dt² = - (B₀² a² / L) v(t).\n\nRearranged:\n\nd²v/dt² + (B₀² a² / (M L)) v(t) = 0.\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\nr² + (B₀² a² / (M L)) = 0.\n\nSolutions are r = ± i ω, where ω = B₀ a / sqrt(M L).\n\nTherefore, the general solution for v(t) is:\n\nv(t) = C₁ cos(ω t) + C₂ sin(ω t).\n\nNow apply initial conditions. At t=0, v(0) = v₀. Also, we need another initial condition for I(0), but maybe we can find it from equation (1) or (2). Wait, initially, at t=0, the loop is just entering the magnetic field. At t=0+, what is the current?\n\nAt t=0, x(0) = 0, so the flux is zero. The rate of change of flux at t=0 is B₀ a v(0) = B₀ a v₀. The induced EMF is -dΦ/dt = -B₀ a v₀. But since the loop has self-inductance L and no resistance, the current will start to increase according to L dI/dt = B₀ a v(t). At t=0, v(0) = v₀, so dI/dt at t=0 is (B₀ a v₀)/L. However, initially, I(0) = 0, because there was no current before entering the field.\n\nWait, but when the loop is just entering the field, the current starts from zero. Therefore, the initial condition for I(0) is 0. Let me check equation (2): at t=0, dv/dt = acceleration. From equation (2): M dv/dt = -B₀ a I(0). If I(0) = 0, then dv/dt at t=0 is 0. Therefore, the initial acceleration is zero. Therefore, for the velocity function v(t) = C₁ cos(ω t) + C₂ sin(ω t), we can apply:\n\nAt t=0: v(0) = C₁ = v₀.\n\nAlso, dv/dt at t=0 is -C₁ ω sin(0) + C₂ ω cos(0) = C₂ ω = 0 ⇒ C₂ = 0.\n\nWait, but that would give v(t) = v₀ cos(ω t). But then, according to equation (2), dv/dt = -v₀ ω sin(ω t). And from equation (2), M dv/dt = -B₀ a I(t). Therefore, I(t) = - [M dv/dt]/[B₀ a] = [M v₀ ω / (B₀ a)] sin(ω t).\n\nBut let's check equation (1): L dI/dt = B₀ a v(t).\n\nCompute dI/dt: [M v₀ ω / (B₀ a)] ω cos(ω t).\n\nLeft-hand side: L * [M v₀ ω² / (B₀ a)] cos(ω t).\n\nRight-hand side: B₀ a v(t) = B₀ a v₀ cos(ω t).\n\nTherefore, equate:\n\nL * [M v₀ ω² / (B₀ a)] cos(ω t) = B₀ a v₀ cos(ω t).\n\nCancel cos(ω t) and v₀:\n\nL * [M ω² / (B₀ a)] = B₀ a.\n\nMultiply both sides by B₀ a:\n\nL M ω² = B₀² a².\n\nBut ω was defined as ω = B₀ a / sqrt(M L). Therefore, ω² = B₀² a² / (M L). Therefore, L M ω² = L M * (B₀² a² / (M L)) ) = B₀² a². Which matches. So the equations are consistent. Therefore, the solution is:\n\nv(t) = v₀ cos(ω t), where ω = B₀ a / sqrt(M L).\n\nBut wait, this seems like the velocity oscillates? That seems counterintuitive. If the loop is entering the magnetic field, we would expect the velocity to decrease due to the opposing force, but according to this solution, it oscillates? That seems odd. What's going on here?\n\nAh! Because the loop has no resistance, the energy is not dissipated as heat, but instead oscillates between kinetic energy and magnetic energy stored in the inductance. Therefore, the velocity oscillates, which is similar to an LC circuit where energy oscillates between electric and magnetic. In this case, the mechanical kinetic energy is oscillating with the magnetic energy in the inductor. Therefore, the solution is indeed an oscillation. However, this seems physically possible only if the loop continues to move back and forth, but in reality, once the loop has entered the field completely, the flux stops changing, and the current would stop. However, in our analysis, we assumed that x(t) < b, so the loop is still entering. But according to our solution, the velocity oscillates between v₀ and -v₀. If the velocity becomes negative, that would mean the loop is moving backward, which would cause it to exit the magnetic field. Therefore, our analysis is only valid for the time when the loop is entering the field, i.e., when x(t) is between 0 and b. However, if the velocity oscillates, then depending on the parameters, the loop might reverse direction before fully entering the field.\n\nBut the problem says \"enters a uniform magnetic field\", so maybe we are to assume that the loop is still entering the field, so we need to consider the solution only for the time when v(t) is positive. However, the problem asks for v(t) as a function of time, so perhaps we need to consider the full oscillation, but with the caveat that once the loop reverses direction, our equations might not hold because the flux would start decreasing, and our earlier analysis of the flux assumes increasing flux. Therefore, maybe the differential equation changes once the velocity becomes negative. However, the problem does not specify any details about the loop stopping or reversing, so perhaps we are to assume that the loop continues to enter the field, but according to our solution, that would require the velocity to stay positive. However, the solution v(t) = v₀ cos(ω t) would become zero at t = π/(2ω), then negative afterwards. Therefore, perhaps the correct solution is only valid up to t = π/(2ω), after which the loop would start exiting the field, and the flux would decrease, changing the sign of the induced EMF. Therefore, the problem might expect us to give the solution only for the period when the loop is entering the field, i.e., for t in [0, π/(2ω)], with v(t) decreasing from v₀ to 0. However, according to the differential equation we derived, the velocity oscillates. But since the loop cannot have negative velocity while entering the field, perhaps there's an error in the derivation.\n\nWait, let me check the derivation again. The key equations were:\n\nFrom Faraday's Law and the circuit: L dI/dt = B₀ a v(t).\n\nFrom Newton's law: M dv/dt = -B₀ a I(t).\n\nThis leads to the differential equation d²v/dt² + (B₀² a² / (M L)) v = 0, which is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator. The solution is indeed oscillatory. But physically, how can this be? Because in reality, if there's no resistance, the system would oscillate indefinitely, converting kinetic energy into magnetic energy and back. However, in reality, there's always some resistance, but the problem states it's completely conductive (zero resistance). Therefore, the mathematical solution is correct, but the physical interpretation requires that when the velocity becomes negative, the loop starts to exit the field, and the flux begins to decrease, which would change the sign of the induced EMF. Therefore, the equations would actually change once the velocity becomes negative. However, since the problem does not specify any such consideration, and given that it's a theoretical problem, perhaps we are to assume that the loop remains in the region where x(t) < b and the flux is still increasing, even though mathematically the velocity becomes negative. But that would be inconsistent with the assumption that the loop is entering the field. Therefore, maybe the problem expects us to consider only the case where the loop is fully entering the field, but with the velocity decreasing monotonically to zero. However, according to our differential equation, that would require damping, which isn't present here because there's no resistance. Therefore, there must be something wrong in the derivation.\n\nWait, let me check the force again. We said that F = -I a B₀. But is this the total force? Let me think again. When the loop is moving with velocity v(t), and current I(t) is flowing, then the force on the left side is -I a B₀ (to the left). However, is there another force? For example, on the right side? No, because the right side is not in the field. What about the top and bottom sides? If the loop is moving, the top and bottom sides are moving with velocity v(t). If they are in the field, they would experience a motional EMF. However, in our case, only part of the loop is in the field. The top and bottom sides are of length b. The top side is from x = position of loop to x = position + b, and same for the bottom. But since the loop is moving along the x-axis, and the magnetic field is in the z-direction, the motional EMF on the top and bottom sides would be v × B. However, since these sides are horizontal (along x-axis), their velocity is along x, and B is along z, so the cross product v × B is in the y-direction. Therefore, there would be a motional EMF along the y-direction on the top and bottom sides. However, since the loop is closed, these EMFs would contribute to the total induced EMF. But in our earlier analysis, we used Faraday's Law based on the changing flux, which should account for all contributions. Therefore, perhaps there is another contribution to the force?\n\nWait, but we already used Faraday's Law to get the EMF and hence the current, and then used that current to compute the force. Therefore, perhaps our force calculation is correct. Therefore, the system is indeed analogous to a harmonic oscillator, with the kinetic energy and magnetic energy oscillating.\n\nBut then, how does this make sense physically? If the loop is moving into the field, it slows down, stops, then moves back out? But in reality, once it stops, the flux would start to decrease, inducing a current in the opposite direction, which would cause a force in the opposite direction, accelerating it back in. So yes, it would oscillate. But this requires that the loop can move back and forth, which would require that the magnetic field region is large enough to allow that. The problem doesn't specify the size of the magnetic field region, so perhaps we are to assume it's large enough, and the loop oscillates indefinitely.\n\nGiven that, then the solution v(t) = v₀ cos(ω t) is acceptable, with ω = B₀ a / sqrt(M L). Then, the distance S(t) would be the integral of v(t) from 0 to t:\n\nS(t) = ∫₀ᵗ v(t') dt' = ∫₀ᵗ v₀ cos(ω t') dt' = (v₀ / ω) sin(ω t).\n\nBut let me check the units. ω has units of 1/seconds. v₀ / ω has units of meters, since v₀ is m/s divided by 1/s gives m. So units are okay.\n\nBut let me check with initial conditions. At t=0, S(0)=0, which is correct. At t approaching π/(2ω), S approaches (v₀ / ω). Then, when t = π/(2ω), the velocity is zero, which would be the maximum distance entered into the field. Then, as t increases further, S(t) decreases, meaning the loop starts to exit the field.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nv(t) = v₀ cos(ω t), where ω = (B₀ a)/√(M L)\n\nand\n\nS(t) = (v₀ / ω) sin(ω t) = (v₀ √(M L)/ (B₀ a)) sin(ω t).\n\nBut let me write ω explicitly:\n\nω = B₀ a / √(M L)\n\nTherefore,\n\nS(t) = v₀ √(M L)/ (B₀ a) * sin( (B₀ a / √(M L)) t )\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the velocity v(t) of the rectangular loop as a function of time, and find the distance S(t) the loop moves.\"\n\nTherefore, these expressions are the answers. However, let me check if there is a different approach or if I missed something.\n\nWait, another way to think about this system is as a mechanical analog of an LC circuit. In an LC circuit, the charge oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor. Here, the kinetic energy (½ M v²) oscillates with the magnetic energy (½ L I²). Let me verify energy conservation.\n\nAt any time, the total energy should be constant, since there's no resistance. Let's check:\n\nTotal energy E = ½ M v² + ½ L I².\n\nFrom our solutions:\n\nv(t) = v₀ cos(ω t)\n\nI(t) can be found from equation (2): M dv/dt = -B₀ a I(t). Therefore,\n\nI(t) = - [M / (B₀ a)] dv/dt = - [M / (B₀ a)] (-v₀ ω sin(ω t)) = [M v₀ ω / (B₀ a)] sin(ω t).\n\nThen,\n\n½ L I² = ½ L [M² v₀² ω² / (B₀² a²)] sin²(ω t).\n\nAnd ½ M v² = ½ M v₀² cos²(ω t).\n\nSo total energy:\n\nE = ½ M v₀² [cos²(ω t) + (L M ω² / (B₀² a²)) sin²(ω t)].\n\nBut from earlier, we had L M ω² = B₀² a². Therefore,\n\nE = ½ M v₀² [cos²(ω t) + sin²(ω t)] = ½ M v₀².\n\nWhich is constant, as expected. Therefore, energy is conserved, confirming that our solutions are correct.\n\nTherefore, despite the counterintuitive oscillation, the mathematics and energy conservation check out. Therefore, the answer is as derived.\n\nBut let me check if the question expects a different result. For example, if there was resistance, we would have damping, but since there's no resistance, it's an undamped oscillator. The problem states the loop is \"completely conductive\", which likely means zero resistance. Therefore, the answer is correct.\n\nThus, the velocity is v(t) = v₀ cos(ω t) with ω = B₀ a / √(M L), and the distance is S(t) = (v₀ / ω)(1 - cos(ω t))? Wait, no, earlier I had S(t) as integral of v(t), which is (v₀ / ω) sin(ω t). Wait, integrating v₀ cos(ω t) from 0 to t gives:\n\n∫₀ᵗ v₀ cos(ω t') dt' = (v₀ / ω) sin(ω t) - (v₀ / ω) sin(0) = (v₀ / ω) sin(ω t). Yes, correct. So S(t) = (v₀ / ω) sin(ω t). However, when t approaches π/(2ω), S(t) reaches maximum value of v₀ / ω, then decreases. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nv(t) = v₀ cos( (B₀ a / √(M L)) t )\n\nand\n\nS(t) = (v₀ √(M L) / (B₀ a)) sin( (B₀ a / √(M L)) t )\n\nAlternatively, writing ω explicitly:\n\nLet me define ω = (B₀ a)/√(M L), then:\n\nv(t) = v₀ cos(ω t)\n\nS(t) = (v₀ / ω) sin(ω t)\n\nBut maybe we can write it more neatly. Let me rationalize the expression for S(t):\n\nSince ω = B₀ a / √(M L), then 1/ω = √(M L) / (B₀ a). Therefore,\n\nS(t) = v₀ * √(M L) / (B₀ a) * sin(ω t).\n\nYes, that's as simplified as it can get.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nv(t) = v₀ cos( (B₀ a / √(M L)) t )\n\nand\n\nS(t) = (v₀ √(M L) / (B₀ a)) sin( (B₀ a / √(M L)) t )\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects the answer in terms of symbols or if there's a different convention. Also, check for any possible miscalculations.\n\nWait, another thought: The self-inductance L of a rectangular loop is generally a function of its dimensions, but the problem gives L as a given parameter, so we don't need to calculate it. Therefore, our answer is fine as it is.\n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct solution. The velocity oscillates sinusoidally, and the distance moved is a sine function as well. This makes sense for an undamped system with no energy loss.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe velocity of the loop as a function of time is $\\boxed{v(t) = v_0 \\cos\\left(\\dfrac{B_0 a}{\\sqrt{M L}} t\\right)}$ and the distance moved is $\\boxed{S(t) = \\dfrac{v_0 \\sqrt{M L}}{B_0 a} \\sin\\left(\\dfrac{B_0 a}{\\sqrt{M L}} t\\right)}$.\n</think>"}
