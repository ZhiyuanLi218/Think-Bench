Let me start by reading the problem again carefully to make sure I understand all the given information and what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem states that X, Y, and Z are all short-period main group elements. The sum of their outermost electrons is 10. X and Z are in the same group. The number of outermost electrons in Y is equal to the number of next outer layer electrons in X. Also, the atomic radius of Y is greater than that of Z. Then there are four options (A to D) and I need to determine which statements are correct.\n\nFirst, let me recall that short-period main group elements refer to the elements in the first three periods (periods 1, 2, 3) of the periodic table. Main group elements are those in groups 1, 2, and 13-18. So, all three elements X, Y, Z are in groups 1, 2, or 13-18, and in periods 1, 2, or 3.\n\nGiven that X and Z are in the same group. Let's denote their group numbers. Let's also note that the sum of their outermost electrons is 10. The outermost electrons for main group elements can be determined by their group number. For groups 1 and 2, the number of valence electrons is 1 and 2 respectively. For groups 13-18, the number of valence electrons is 3-8 (group number minus 10). For example, group 13 has 3 valence electrons, group 14 has 4, up to group 18 with 8.\n\nLet me denote the valence electrons of X, Y, Z as Vx, Vy, Vz. So, Vx + Vy + Vz = 10.\n\nAlso, it's given that Vy (number of outermost electrons in Y) is equal to the number of next outer layer electrons in X. The next outer layer electrons would be the electrons in the shell just below the valence shell. For example, if X is in period 2, its valence electrons are in the second shell, and the next outer layer (which would be the first shell) has 2 electrons. If X is in period 3, then the next outer layer would be the second shell. Let's think about that.\n\nWait, the \"next outer layer electrons\" in X. Let me clarify. The outermost electrons are in the valence shell. The next outer layer would be the shell just before the valence shell. For example, if X is in period 2 (so valence electrons in n=2), then the next outer layer (the shell just below) would be n=1, which for period 2 elements, the first shell has 2 electrons. If X is in period 3, valence electrons are in n=3, next outer layer is n=2. The number of electrons in that shell depends on the element. For example, if X is in period 3, group 1 (Na), then the n=2 shell has 8 electrons. If X is in group 13 (Al), then the n=2 shell also has 8 electrons (since Al has 2 electrons in n=1, 8 in n=2, and 3 in n=3). So, the number of electrons in the next outer layer for X is the number of electrons in the shell just before the valence shell. So for any element, that would be the electrons in the (n-1)th shell. For example, for period 2 elements, the (n-1)th shell is n=1 with 2 electrons. For period 3 elements, the (n-1)th shell is n=2, which can have 2 or 8 electrons depending on the element. Wait, but for period 3 elements, the second shell (n=2) is filled with 8 electrons for all of them. Because the third period elements start filling the 3s and then 3p orbitals. The second shell is filled with 8 electrons. So for any period 3 element, the next outer layer (n=2) has 8 electrons. For period 2 elements, the next outer layer (n=1) has 2 electrons. For period 1 elements, there is no shell before the valence shell, but since they are in period 1, their valence shell is n=1. However, since the elements are in short periods (periods 1-3), and main group elements, but period 1 elements are H and He, which are groups 1 and 18.\n\nBut the problem says X, Y, Z are all short-period main group elements. So possible elements are H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar. But since they are main group elements, transition metals are excluded.\n\nNow, let's try to figure out the valence electrons for X, Y, Z. Let me denote:\n\nVx + Vy + Vz = 10.\n\nAlso, Vy = number of electrons in the next outer layer of X. Which is, if X is in period 1, then there is no next outer layer. But X can't be in period 1 because if X is in period 1, then the next outer layer would be nonexistent, so Vy would be zero, which is impossible. Therefore, X must be in period 2 or 3. Similarly for Z, since X and Z are in the same group, if X is in period 2, Z could be in period 2 or 3 (but same group). But since they are all short-period, Z can't be in period 4.\n\nSo, for X in period 2: next outer layer is n=1, which has 2 electrons. Therefore, Vy = 2.\n\nFor X in period 3: next outer layer is n=2, which has 8 electrons. Therefore, Vy = 8.\n\nSo, Vy is either 2 or 8, depending on whether X is in period 2 or 3.\n\nSo let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: X is in period 2, so Vy = 2. Then Vx + 2 + Vz = 10. Also, since X and Z are in the same group, their valence electrons are the same. So Vx = Vz. Therefore, 2*Vx + 2 = 10 => 2*Vx = 8 => Vx = 4. Therefore, Vx = Vz = 4. So X and Z have 4 valence electrons, which would put them in group 14. However, group 14 elements have 4 valence electrons. So for period 2, group 14 is carbon (C), which is in period 2. Then Z, being in the same group, could be in period 3, which is silicon (Si). So X is C (group 14, period 2), Z is Si (group 14, period 3). Then Vy = 2, so Y has 2 valence electrons, which would put Y in group 2 (alkaline earth metals). So possible elements in group 2: Be (period 2), Mg (period 3). But the atomic radius of Y is greater than that of Z. Z is Si (period 3). Let's check the atomic radii. In the same period, atomic radius decreases from left to right. So in period 3, Mg is to the left of Si, so Mg has a larger atomic radius than Si. If Y is Mg (group 2, period 3), then Y's atomic radius is larger than Z (Si). So that fits the condition. Alternatively, if Y is Be (period 2), but Z is Si (period 3). However, atomic radius increases down a group. So Si (period 3) has a larger atomic radius than C (period 2). But Y is supposed to have a larger atomic radius than Z. If Y is Be (period 2), then Z is Si (period 3), and Be is in period 2, which is above Si (period 3), so Si has a larger atomic radius than Be. Therefore, Be's atomic radius is smaller than Si's. So that doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, Y must be Mg (group 2, period 3), which has a larger atomic radius than Si (Z). So this case seems possible.\n\nCase 2: X is in period 3, so Vy = 8. Then Vx + 8 + Vz = 10. Again, since X and Z are in same group, Vx = Vz. Therefore, 2*Vx + 8 = 10 => 2*Vx = 2 => Vx = 1. Therefore, X and Z have 1 valence electron, which would put them in group 1. For period 3, group 1 is sodium (Na). So Z, being in same group, would be in group 1, but since X is in period 3, Z could be in period 1 (Li) or period 2 (Na is in period 3, but group 1 in period 2 is Li). Wait, group 1 elements in periods 1, 2, 3 are H (period 1?), Li (period 2), Na (period 3). Wait, hydrogen is in group 1 but sometimes considered in group 17 as well. However, the problem says main group elements. So X is in group 1, period 3 (Na). Then Z could be in same group, so either Li (period 2) or Na (period 3). But since X is in period 3, Z could be in period 2 or 3. But if X is in period 3, and Z is in same group, then Z could be Li (period 2) or Na (period 3). However, the problem states that all three are short-period elements (periods 1-3). So Z could be Li or Na. However, let's see Vy = 8. Y has 8 valence electrons, which would put Y in group 18 (noble gases). The possible elements in group 18 in short periods are He (period 1), Ne (period 2), Ar (period 3). Now, the atomic radius of Y must be greater than that of Z. Let's consider possibilities for Z.\n\nIf Z is Li (group 1, period 2), then Y has to be a noble gas with larger atomic radius than Li. The noble gases in periods 1-3 are He, Ne, Ar. Atomic radius increases down the group. He is period 1, Ne period 2, Ar period 3. So Ar has the largest atomic radius among them. Li is in period 2. The atomic radius of Ar (period 3) is larger than Li (period 2)? Let's check. Atomic radius generally increases down a group and decreases across a period. So in period 2, Ne is to the right of Li. Li has a larger atomic radius than Ne. Ar is in period 3, same period as Cl, but Ar is to the right. However, comparing Ar (period 3) to Li (period 2), Ar is in a lower period, so it's larger. So Ar has larger atomic radius than Li. Therefore, if Y is Ar (group 18, period 3), and Z is Li (group 1, period 2), then Y's atomic radius is larger than Z's. So that works. Alternatively, if Z is Na (period 3), then Y would have to be a noble gas with larger atomic radius than Na. But the noble gas in period 3 is Ar. Ar is in period 3, same period as Na. In period 3, atomic radius decreases from left to right. So Na is to the left of Ar, so Na has a larger atomic radius than Ar. Therefore, if Y is Ar and Z is Na, then Y's atomic radius is smaller than Z's, which doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, Z cannot be Na. Therefore, in this case, Z is Li (period 2), Y is Ar (period 3). Let me confirm:\n\nX is Na (group 1, period 3), Z is Li (group 1, period 2). Y is Ar (group 18, period 3). Then Vy = 8 (Ar has 8 valence electrons). Vx = 1 (Na), Vz = 1 (Li). Sum is 1 + 8 + 1 = 10. Correct. Also, Y (Ar) has larger atomic radius than Z (Li)? Wait, Ar is in period 3, Li is in period 2. Atomic radius increases down a group and increases across a period from left to right. Wait, no, atomic radius decreases across a period from left to right. So in period 3, Na is larger than Mg, which is larger than Al, etc., up to Ar. So Ar has a smaller atomic radius than Na. But Li is in period 2. How does Ar (period 3) compare to Li (period 2)? Ar is in a lower period (3) than Li (2), so it's larger. So yes, Ar has a larger atomic radius than Li. Therefore, this case is also possible.\n\nSo there are two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: X = C (group 14, period 2), Z = Si (group 14, period 3), Y = Mg (group 2, period 3)\n\nCase 2: X = Na (group 1, period 3), Z = Li (group 1, period 2), Y = Ar (group 18, period 3)\n\nNow we need to check which of these cases are valid and then evaluate the options A to D.\n\nBut first, let me check if there are other possibilities. For example, in Case 1, could Y be another element with 2 valence electrons? For example, Be (group 2, period 2). But if Y is Be (period 2), then Z is Si (period 3). The atomic radius of Be is smaller than Si (since Si is in a lower period), so that doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, only Mg is possible in this case.\n\nIn Case 2, if Y is Ne (group 18, period 2), then Vy = 8. Let's see: if Y is Ne (period 2), then Z is Li (period 2). The atomic radius of Ne is smaller than Li? Wait, in period 2, Li is on the left, Ne is on the far right. So Li has a larger atomic radius than Ne. Therefore, if Y is Ne, then Y's atomic radius is smaller than Z (Li), which doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, Y must be Ar (period 3) in this case.\n\nTherefore, the two cases are valid.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case and see which options are correct.\n\nFirst, let's look at the options:\n\nA) Melting point: the oxide of X is higher than that of Y\n\nB) Thermal stability: the hydride of X is greater than that of Z\n\nC) X and Z can form an ionic compound ZX\n\nD) The simple substances of Y and Z can both dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid\n\nWe need to check for each case whether these statements hold, and see which options are correct.\n\nLet me first consider Case 1: X = C, Y = Mg, Z = Si\n\nCase 1:\n\nX is carbon (C), Y is magnesium (Mg), Z is silicon (Si)\n\nLet's check each option.\n\nA) Melting point: oxide of X vs oxide of Y.\n\nOxide of X (C): Carbon forms several oxides, like CO and CO2. However, the most common oxides with higher melting points are CO2 (which is a gas at STP, so low melting point), but carbon also forms graphite and diamond, but those are elemental forms, not oxides. Wait, maybe the oxide refers to the most common or typical oxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to a metal oxide or a non-metal oxide. For example, MgO is a basic oxide, and CO2 is an acidic oxide. The melting point of MgO is very high (around 2800°C) because it's an ionic compound with strong ionic bonds. CO2 is a molecular compound with low melting point. However, if X is carbon, maybe the oxide is CO2. In that case, the melting point of CO2 is much lower than MgO. Therefore, the melting point of X's oxide (CO2) is lower than Y's oxide (MgO). Therefore, statement A is incorrect in this case. However, if there's another oxide of carbon, like carbon monoxide (CO), but CO has a melting point of -205°C, which is still much lower than MgO. So A would be incorrect here. Therefore, in Case 1, A is incorrect.\n\nB) Thermal stability: hydride of X vs hydride of Z.\n\nHydride of X (C) is methane (CH4). Hydride of Z (Si) is silane (SiH4). Thermal stability generally decreases down a group. Since C and Si are in the same group, and C is above Si, CH4 is more thermally stable than SiH4. Therefore, B is correct in this case.\n\nC) X and Z can form an ionic compound ZX. X is C, Z is Si. So ZX would be SiC. However, SiC is a covalent compound, not ionic. Therefore, statement C is incorrect here.\n\nD) The simple substances of Y and Z can both dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid. Y is Mg, Z is Si. Let's see:\n\nMg (metal) reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid. Depending on the conditions, it can produce different products. For example, with concentrated H2SO4, Mg can react to produce SO2, H2S, or even elemental sulfur. However, it does react, so Mg dissolves.\n\nSi (silicon) reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid? Let me recall. Silicon is generally not very reactive with acids except for hydrofluoric acid. Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. At high temperatures, sulfuric acid can oxidize silicon. The reaction is: Si + 2 H2SO4 → SiO2 + 2 SO2 + 2 H2O. Therefore, silicon can dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid under heating. However, under normal conditions, the reaction might be slow or require heating. The problem doesn't specify conditions, but if we assume that it's possible, then both Y (Mg) and Z (Si) can dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid. Therefore, statement D is correct in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider Case 2: X = Na, Y = Ar, Z = Li\n\nCase 2:\n\nX is sodium (Na), Y is argon (Ar), Z is lithium (Li)\n\nCheck each option:\n\nA) Melting point: oxide of X (Na) vs oxide of Y (Ar). But Ar is a noble gas, it doesn't form an oxide under normal conditions. However, there are some oxides of xenon and argon under extreme conditions, but they are not common. Since the problem is likely referring to common oxides, Y's oxide doesn't exist. Therefore, this case may be invalid, or the option A is not applicable. However, since the problem is presented as a valid question, maybe this case is invalid. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering Case 2.\n\nWait, but the problem states that X, Y, Z are all short-period main group elements. Ar is a main group element (group 18). However, the oxide of Y (Ar) would not be a common compound. Therefore, if the problem expects us to consider common compounds, then this case might not be valid, or the options may not hold. Let me check if there's any possible oxide of Ar. Argon can form compounds like HArF under extreme conditions, but oxides are not typical. Therefore, in this case, option A is comparing the melting point of Na's oxide (Na2O) with Ar's oxide, which doesn't exist. Therefore, this case may not be valid. Therefore, perhaps only Case 1 is valid. But why?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in Case 2. Let me check again. In Case 2, X is Na (group 1, period 3), Z is Li (group 1, period 2), Y is Ar (group 18, period 3). The valence electrons: Vx = 1 (Na), Vy = 8 (Ar), Vz = 1 (Li). Sum is 1+8+1=10. Correct. Also, Y's atomic radius is larger than Z's. Ar (period 3) has larger atomic radius than Li (period 2). Correct. However, the problem says \"the sum of the outermost electrons in their atoms is 10\". Ar has 8 valence electrons, correct. So this case is valid in terms of the given conditions, but when evaluating the options, some options may not make sense. For example, option B: thermal stability of hydride of X (Na) vs hydride of Z (Li). Hydride of Na is NaH, hydride of Li is LiH. Both are ionic hydrides, and their thermal stability? Thermal stability of ionic hydrides generally increases with increasing ionic size. Since Li is smaller than Na, LiH is more stable than NaH? Wait, no, thermal stability of ionic hydrides increases with the size of the metal ion. Larger cations stabilize the hydride ion more. So Li+ is smaller, so LiH is less stable than NaH? Wait, thermal stability of ionic hydrides tends to increase down the group because the lattice energy decreases (as the cation size increases), but the bond strength between H- and the cation... Wait, actually, for ionic hydrides, the thermal stability depends on the lattice energy. The lattice energy decreases as the cation size increases. So LiH has higher lattice energy than NaH, so LiH is more stable? Wait, higher lattice energy means more stable, so LiH would be more stable than NaH. Therefore, the thermal stability of hydride of X (NaH) is less than that of Z (LiH). Therefore, B would be incorrect in this case. But the statement B says \"thermal stability: hydride of X is greater than that of Z\". In Case 2, X is Na, Z is Li, so hydride of X (NaH) is less stable than hydride of Z (LiH). Therefore, B is incorrect here. However, in Case 1, B is correct. So depending on which case is valid, B could be correct or not. But how do we know which case is the actual one?\n\nBut the problem is presented as having a unique solution. Therefore, perhaps there is only one valid case. Let me check again why Case 2 may not be valid.\n\nIn Case 2, Y is Ar (group 18). The problem says \"the number of outermost electrons in Y is equal to the number of next outer layer electrons in X\". For X being Na (period 3), the next outer layer is the second shell, which has 8 electrons. Therefore, Vy = 8, which is correct for Ar (group 18, 8 valence electrons). So that's correct. However, the problem says \"the sum of the outermost electrons in their atoms is 10\". Ar has 8, X and Z have 1 each. Total 10. Correct. Also, Y's atomic radius is larger than Z's. Ar is larger than Li. Correct. So Case 2 is valid. However, when evaluating the options, some options may not make sense. For example, option A: oxide of X (Na2O) vs oxide of Y (Ar's oxide, which doesn't exist). Therefore, in this case, option A is comparing a real oxide with a non-existent one, which may not be a valid comparison. However, the problem is presented as having correct options, so perhaps Case 2 is invalid because Y is a noble gas, which doesn't form hydrides or oxides under normal conditions, making some options invalid. Therefore, maybe Case 1 is the correct scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again.\n\nIn the problem statement, there's no mention of Y forming compounds. The options refer to oxides, hydrides, etc. So for option B, thermal stability of hydride of X vs Z. In Case 2, X is Na, Z is Li. Hydride of X is NaH, hydride of Z is LiH. Both are ionic hydrides. As mentioned, thermal stability increases down the group. So LiH is less stable than NaH? Wait, no, thermal stability increases with the size of the metal ion. Let me recall the thermal stability of alkali metal hydrides. For example, LiH decomposes at higher temperatures than NaH? Wait, no. Actually, the thermal stability of ionic hydrides tends to increase with increasing size of the metal ion. Because the lattice energy decreases with larger cations, but the bond strength between the hydride ion and the cation also decreases. However, the decomposition of ionic hydrides typically involves the breakdown into metal and hydrogen gas. The enthalpy of formation becomes less exothermic for larger cations. Therefore, smaller cations (like Li+) have more exothermic formation and are more stable? Or is it the opposite? This is getting complicated. Let me look up a general trend. For ionic hydrides, thermal stability generally decreases down the group. For example, in group 1, LiH is more stable than NaH, which is more stable than KH, etc. Wait, no, I think the opposite is true. Let me think: the smaller the cation, the higher the lattice energy, so the more stable the compound. Therefore, LiH has higher lattice energy than NaH, so LiH is more thermally stable. Therefore, if X is Na, Z is Li, then hydride of X (NaH) is less thermally stable than hydride of Z (LiH). Therefore, statement B says \"thermal stability: hydride of X is greater than that of Z\", which would be false in this case. However, in Case 1, B is true. Therefore, if only one of the cases is valid, which one is it?\n\nBut how do we determine which case is correct? The problem states that all three elements are short-period main group elements. Both cases satisfy that. However, in Case 2, Y is a noble gas. The problem doesn't specify any other conditions, but perhaps the options can help us determine which case is correct. For example, in Case 2, option C: X and Z can form an ionic compound ZX. X is Na, Z is Li. ZX would be LiNa? But Na and Li are both metals and would form an alloy, not an ionic compound. Therefore, statement C is incorrect in Case 2. In Case 1, X is C (non-metal), Z is Si (non-metal). They form SiC, which is a covalent compound, not ionic. So statement C is also incorrect in Case 1. Therefore, both cases make option C incorrect. But maybe there's another possibility?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a third case I haven't considered. Let me check again.\n\nIs there another possibility for X and Z?\n\nIn the first case, X is in period 2, group 14 (C), Z is in period 3, group 14 (Si). In the second case, X is in period 3, group 1 (Na), Z is in period 2, group 1 (Li). Are there other groups where X and Z could be?\n\nLet me think. For example, if X is in period 2, group 15 (N), then Z would be in group 15, period 3 (P). Then Vy = 2 (since X is in period 2, next outer layer has 2 electrons). So Vx = 5 (group 15), Vz = 5. Sum is 5 + Vy + 5 = 10 → Vy = 0. That's impossible. So no.\n\nIf X is in period 2, group 13 (B), then Vx = 3, Vz = 3. Sum is 3 + Vy + 3 = 10 → Vy = 4. Then Y has 4 valence electrons, which would be group 14. So Y is in group 14. Let's check if this works. For example, Y could be C (period 2) or Si (period 3). The atomic radius of Y should be greater than Z. Z is in group 13, period 3: Al. If Y is Si (period 3), then compare Y (Si) and Z (Al). In period 3, Al is to the left of Si, so Al has a larger atomic radius than Si. Therefore, Y's atomic radius is smaller than Z's, which violates the condition. If Y is C (period 2), then Y (C) has smaller atomic radius than Z (Al, period 3). Also violates. So this case is invalid.\n\nIf X is in period 2, group 16 (O), then Vx = 6, Vz = 6. Sum is 6 + Vy + 6 = 10 → Vy = -2. Impossible.\n\nIf X is in period 2, group 17 (F), Vx = 7, Vz = 7. Sum 7 + Vy +7 = 10 → Vy = -4. Impossible.\n\nIf X is in period 2, group 1 (Li?), but group 1 in period 2 is Li. Wait, no, group 1 in period 2 is Li, but period 2 group 1 has 1 valence electron. If X is Li (period 2), then Z is in same group (group 1), period 3 (Na). Then Vy = 2 (since X is in period 2, next outer layer has 2 electrons). Sum: Vx = 1, Vz = 1, Vy = 2 → 1+1+2=4, which is not 10. Doesn't satisfy. So invalid.\n\nIf X is in period 3, group 2 (Mg), then Vx = 2, Vz = 2. Sum: 2 + Vy + 2 = 10 → Vy = 6. So Y has 6 valence electrons, which is group 16. Let's see. Vy = 6, group 16. Possible elements in group 16: O (period 2), S (period 3), Te (period 4, but not short-period). So Y could be O or S. The atomic radius of Y must be greater than Z. Z is in group 2, same group as X (period 3). Wait, X is in period 3 group 2 (Mg), so Z is in same group. Could be Be (period 2) or Mg (period 3). Let's see:\n\nIf Z is Be (period 2), then Y has to be group 16 with larger atomic radius than Be. Possible Y is O (period 2) or S (period 3). Be is in period 2. O is in period 2 to the right of Be, so O has smaller atomic radius than Be. S is in period 3, which has larger atomic radius than Be. So Y is S (period 3, group 16). Then, the sum is Vx (Mg=2) + Vy (S=6) + Vz (Be=2) = 10. Correct. Also, Y (S) has larger atomic radius than Z (Be). Yes, because S is in period 3, Be in period 2. This is another possible case!\n\nSo this is Case 3:\n\nCase 3: X = Mg (group 2, period 3), Z = Be (group 2, period 2), Y = S (group 16, period 3)\n\nLet me check the conditions:\n\n- X and Z in same group (group 2): yes.\n\n- Sum of valence electrons: Mg (2) + S (6) + Be (2) = 10: yes.\n\n- Vy (S has 6 valence electrons) equals the number of next outer layer electrons in X. X is Mg (period 3), next outer layer is n=2, which has 8 electrons. Wait, but Vy is supposed to be equal to that. But Vy is 6 here. So this contradicts the condition. Wait, what's the problem here?\n\nAh! Earlier, I thought that if X is in period 3, then Vy = 8 (next outer layer electrons). But in this case, X is in period 3 (Mg), so the next outer layer electrons should be 8, but Vy is 6. This violates the condition. Therefore, this case is invalid. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. Earlier, I considered that if X is in period 2, then Vy = 2 (next outer layer is n=1 with 2 electrons), and if X is in period 3, then Vy = 8 (next outer layer is n=2 with 8 electrons). In this case, X is in period 3, so Vy should be 8, but in this case, I set Vy = 6, which is incorrect. Therefore, this case is invalid. My mistake was in thinking about the valence electrons for Y.\n\nTherefore, this case is invalid. Therefore, no other cases.\n\nTherefore, only Case 1 and Case 2 are valid. But in Case 2, Y is a noble gas, which complicates some of the options. However, let's proceed to analyze both cases and see which options are consistently correct.\n\nLet's revisit Case 2:\n\nCase 2: X = Na (group 1, period 3), Z = Li (group 1, period 2), Y = Ar (group 18, period 3)\n\nOption A: Melting point of oxide of X (Na2O) vs oxide of Y (Ar's oxide). Since Ar's oxide doesn't exist, this option is problematic. However, if we assume that the question expects us to consider only valid compounds, maybe this case is invalid. Therefore, perhaps Case 1 is the correct scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis of Case 2. Let me check if Y could be a different element.\n\nWait, in Case 2, Vy = 8. Y has 8 valence electrons. Other than noble gases, are there other elements with 8 valence electrons? No, because for main group elements, group 18 has 8 valence electrons. Other elements have less. For example, O has 6, F has 7, Ne has 8. So Y has to be in group 18. Therefore, Y is a noble gas. Therefore, Case 2 is valid, but some options may not apply. However, the problem is presented as having correct options, so likely Case 1 is the intended scenario.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with Case 1: X = C, Y = Mg, Z = Si.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the options in Case 1:\n\nA) Melting point: oxide of X (CO2 or maybe another oxide like SiO2 if X is Si, but in this case X is C. Wait, X is C, so oxide is CO2 or CO. CO2 is a molecular solid with low melting point. MgO is an ionic solid with very high melting point. Therefore, the melting point of X's oxide is lower than Y's oxide. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\nB) Thermal stability: hydride of X (CH4) vs hydride of Z (SiH4). As explained earlier, CH4 is more thermally stable than SiH4. Therefore, B is correct.\n\nC) X and Z can form an ionic compound ZX. X is C, Z is Si. ZX would be SiC, which is a covalent compound. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.\n\nD) Simple substances of Y and Z can both dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid. Y is Mg, which reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid. Z is Si, which can react with concentrated sulfuric acid under heating. Therefore, both can dissolve, so D is correct.\n\nTherefore, in Case 1, options B and D are correct.\n\nNow, let's check Case 2 again, even though it has a problematic option A.\n\nCase 2: X = Na, Y = Ar, Z = Li.\n\nOption A: Melting point of oxide of X (Na2O) vs Y's oxide (non-existent). Assuming the question expects this to be invalid, but if we proceed, perhaps the oxide of Y is considered as something else? Not likely. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Thermal stability of hydride of X (NaH) vs Z (LiH). As discussed, LiH is more stable than NaH, so statement B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: X and Z form ionic compound ZX. ZX would be LiNa, which is not an ionic compound but a metallic alloy. Therefore, incorrect.\n\nOption D: Simple substances of Y (Ar) and Z (Li) dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid. Ar is a noble gas and does not react with concentrated sulfuric acid. Li reacts with it. Therefore, D is incorrect because Y (Ar) doesn't dissolve. Therefore, in Case 2, all options are incorrect. But the problem must have correct options, so likely Case 1 is the correct scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. However, let me check the options given in the question.\n\nThe options are:\n\n(A) Melting point: the oxide of X is higher than that of Y\n\n(B) Thermal stability: the hydride of X is greater than that of Z\n\n(C) X and Z can form an ionic compound ZX\n\n(D) The simple substances of Y and Z can both dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid\n\nIn Case 1, B and D are correct. Let's verify again.\n\nOption D: Y is Mg (metal), which reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid. Z is Si, which reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid under heating. The question says \"can both dissolve\", but does it specify under what conditions? In laboratory settings, Si may require heating to react with concentrated H2SO4, but it does dissolve. Mg reacts vigorously with concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature. So both can dissolve, so D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. However, looking back at the options, the user provided options A to D, and the answer should be among them. The question is in Chinese, but the options are labeled A-D. The user hasn't specified if multiple options are correct, but in the original problem, it's likely that multiple options are correct. However, the user instruction says \"the following statements are correct: Options: (A)... (B)... etc.\" and to provide the correct ones.\n\nBut let me check the options again for Case 1:\n\nB is correct.\n\nD is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities.\n\nIs there any other case where other options could be correct?\n\nNo, based on our analysis, only Case 1 is valid and gives B and D as correct.\n\nBut let me check option C again. In Case 1, X is C, Z is Si. Can they form an ionic compound ZX? No, because both are non-metals and form a covalent compound (SiC). Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D.\n\nBut wait, the original problem may have different correct answers. Let me verify each option once again.\n\nOption B: Thermal stability of hydride of X (CH4) vs Z (SiH4). Yes, CH4 is more stable. Correct.\n\nOption D: Y is Mg, which dissolves in concentrated sulfuric acid. Z is Si, which can dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid under heating. The question says \"can both dissolve\", and in chemistry, dissolution can occur under appropriate conditions. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, options B and D are correct.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The user provided options A-D, and the correct ones are B and D. However, looking back at the problem statement, it says \"the following statements are correct: Options: (A)... (B)... (C)... (D)...\". So it's possible that multiple options are correct. In Chinese multiple-choice questions, sometimes multiple options are correct, but the user might need to select all that apply. However, the way the user presented the options suggests that it's multiple-choice, possibly with multiple correct answers.\n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake in my analysis of option D. For Y (Mg) and Z (Si):\n\nMg reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce SO2, H2S, or S, depending on the concentration and temperature. For example:\n\nMg + 2 H2SO4 → MgSO4 + SO2 + 2 H2O (at moderate temperatures)\n\nAt higher temperatures, it can produce H2S:\n\n3 Mg + 4 H2SO4 → 3 MgSO4 + S + 4 H2O\n\nOr other products. Regardless, Mg does react and dissolve.\n\nSi reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid when heated:\n\nSi + 2 H2SO4 → SiO2 + 2 SO2 + 2 H2O\n\nSo silicon dioxide is formed, and the silicon dissolves in the acid under heating. Therefore, both Y (Mg) and Z (Si) can dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid, so option D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, the user lists them as (A), (B), (C), (D). In Chinese exams, sometimes options are labeled with letters and you choose all correct ones. However, the user hasn't specified if it's multiple correct, but given the way the question is phrased, it's likely that multiple options are correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possibility. For example, in Case 1, option A says the melting point of X's oxide is higher than Y's. In Case 1, X is C, whose oxide (CO2) has a much lower melting point than MgO (Y's oxide). Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\nOption C is incorrect as discussed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, in some cases, maybe only one is correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem may have only one correct answer, but according to our analysis, both B and D are correct. Let me check if there's any mistake.\n\nFor B: Thermal stability of hydride of X (CH4) vs Z (SiH4). Yes, CH4 is more stable. Correct.\n\nFor D: Both Y and Z dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid. Yes, Mg reacts, Si reacts under heating. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, both B and D are correct. However, looking at the options given by the user, the answer choices are labeled (A), (B), (C), (D). In some exams, you might need to select all that apply, but the way the question is presented here, it's possible that the correct answers are B and D.\n\nBut let me check the options again in the problem statement. The user wrote:\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) Melting point: the oxide of X is higher than that of Y\n\n(B) Thermal stability: the hydride of X is greater than that of Z\n\n(C) X and Z can form an ionic compound ZX\n\n(D) The simple substances of Y and Z can both dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid\n\nIn Chinese standardized tests, sometimes options are single-select, but sometimes multiple-select. Given that the user hasn't specified, but the way the question is written, it's possible that multiple are correct. However, let me check if there's any other consideration.\n\nFor example, in option D, \"can both dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid\". For Mg, it reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid, but for Si, it requires heating. If the question implies \"at room temperature\", then Si might not dissolve, making D incorrect. However, typically, when such questions are asked, unless specified, they assume standard conditions or that the reaction is possible under appropriate conditions (which includes heating). Therefore, D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D.\n\nBut let me check if the original problem might have different correct answers. For example, maybe I made a mistake in Case 1.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to look at the possible elements and see which options make sense.\n\nGiven that X and Z are in the same group, and the sum of their valence electrons plus Y's is 10.\n\nIf we consider Case 1: X=C (4), Y=Mg (2), Z=Si (4). Sum is 4+2+4=10. Correct.\n\nNow, option C: X and Z form ionic compound ZX. ZX would be SiC. But SiC is covalent, not ionic. So C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the answer might be only one of them. Let me check if there's any other mistake.\n\nFor example, option B: Thermal stability of hydride of X is greater than Z. For hydrides of group 14 elements, thermal stability decreases down the group. CH4 > SiH4 > GeH4 > etc. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D.\n\nBut the original problem may have different intended answers. However, based on the analysis, B and D are correct.\n\nBut let me check if the user's options are labeled with letters, and whether in the original problem there might be only one correct answer. For example, maybe I made a mistake in Case 1's option D.\n\nFor Y (Mg): Yes, it reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\nFor Z (Si): Yes, it reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid when heated.\n\nTherefore, both can dissolve, so D is correct.\n\nThus, the correct options are B and D.\n\nBut let me check if the original problem might have only one correct answer. For example, in some cases, maybe D is incorrect.\n\nFor example, if Z is Si, does it dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid? As I mentioned earlier, under heating, silicon reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce SiO2, SO2, and water. So silicon is oxidized to SiO2, and the sulfuric acid is reduced to SO2. Therefore, the silicon does \"dissolve\" in the sense that it reacts and is consumed, even though it forms a different compound. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D.\n\nBut looking at the options given, the user might expect multiple correct answers. However, in the original problem's context (assuming it's a Chinese Gaokao or similar), sometimes the options are single-select, but it's possible that multiple are correct. However, since the user hasn't specified, and given that in the analysis B and D are correct, I'll go with that.\n\nBut let me check once more if there's any other possibility.\n\nIs there a scenario where only one of B or D is correct?\n\nNo, in Case 1, both B and D are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided by the user, the answer choices are labeled (A), (B), (C), (D). In Chinese exams, sometimes the options are single-select, but it's possible that multiple are correct. However, if the user is expecting a single answer, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in my analysis of Case 1's option D. For example, if \"simple substances\" refers to the elemental form, then Y is Mg metal, which reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid. Z is silicon, which reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid when heated. So both can dissolve, making D correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be options B and D.\n\nBut the user's options are listed as (A), (B), (C), (D). If the correct answers are B and D, then the user should select both. However, since the user might expect a single answer, but based on analysis, both B and D are correct.\n\nHowever, looking back at the problem statement, let me check if there's any other constraint I missed.\n\nThe problem states that X, Y, Z are all short-period main group elements. In Case 1, all are in periods 2 and 3, correct.\n\nThe sum of their outermost electrons is 10: 4+2+4=10, correct.\n\nX and Z in same group: group 14, correct.\n\nVy (2) equals next outer layer electrons of X (which is period 2, next outer layer is n=1 with 2 electrons), correct.\n\nAtomic radius of Y (Mg) is greater than Z (Si): yes, because Mg is in period 3, group 2; Si is in period 3, group 14. Atomic radius decreases across a period, so Mg > Si. Correct.\n\nTherefore, Case 1 is valid, and options B and D are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D. However, in the original problem, it's possible that only one of them is considered correct, but based on the analysis, both are correct.\n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\nOption B: Thermal stability of hydride of X is greater than that of Z.\n\nFor X=C (CH4), Z=Si (SiH4). Yes, correct.\n\nOption D: Both Y and Z dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, both B and D are correct.\n\nBut if the options are single-select, perhaps there's a mistake. However, in most such problems, multiple options can be correct. Given that, the correct answers are B and D.\n\nHowever, looking back at the original problem's options, it's possible that the intended answer is only B or only D, but based on the analysis, both are correct.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct options are B and D.\n</think>"}
