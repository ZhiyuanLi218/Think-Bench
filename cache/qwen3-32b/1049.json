The light undergoes **refraction**, **internal reflection**, and **dispersion** within the droplets. These processes separate the white light into its component colors, creating the familiar arc of a rainbow. This phenomenon is **not diffraction**, but rather a combination of **refraction and dispersion**.\n\n**→ Not the correct answer.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Colored stripes can be seen when observing a fluorescent lamp through a narrow slit**\n\nThis is a classic example of **light diffraction**. When light passes through a narrow slit, it spreads out due to **diffraction**, and the various wavelengths (colors) of light spread out to different degrees. This results in a **colored diffraction pattern**, with a central bright fringe and alternating bright and dark fringes. The presence of colored stripes suggests the **dispersion of different wavelengths** due to diffraction.\n\nThis is a **single-slit diffraction** scenario, and the colored fringes arise from the **different diffraction angles** of different wavelengths of light.\n\n**→ This is a correct example of light diffraction.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: The mirage phenomenon**\n\nMirages are caused by **refraction** in layers of air with different temperatures and densities. The bending of light rays as they pass through these layers creates the illusion of water on a hot road or in the desert. This is a result of **total internal reflection** and **refractive index changes**, not diffraction.\n\n**→ Not the correct answer.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Colorful stripes appear on soap bubbles under sunlight**\n\nThis is a well-known example of **thin-film interference**. When light reflects off the top and bottom surfaces of a soap film, the reflected waves **interfere constructively or destructively**, depending on the thickness of the film and the wavelength of the light. This interference leads to the colorful patterns observed on soap bubbles.\n\n**→ This is interference, not diffraction.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Conclusion**\n\nAmong the listed options, **only Option B** corresponds to the phenomenon of **light diffraction**, specifically **single-slit diffraction**, where the light spreads out and forms a visible pattern of colored fringes.\n\n---\n\n**Answer: (B)**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the given options is an example of light diffraction. Let me start by recalling what diffraction is. From what I remember, diffraction is the bending of light waves around obstacles or the spreading out of light waves as they pass through a narrow opening. It's a phenomenon that occurs when light encounters an obstacle or a slit that's comparable in size to the wavelength of the light.\n\nNow let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: A rainbow appearing in the sky after rain. I think rainbows are formed due to the reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light in water droplets. So when sunlight enters a water droplet, it slows down and bends (refraction), reflects off the inside surface, and then bends again as it exits. The different colors bend by different amounts, which is why we see a spectrum. This sounds more like refraction and dispersion rather than diffraction. So maybe A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: Colored stripes can be seen when observing a fluorescent lamp through a narrow slit. Hmm, when you look through a narrow slit, like the gap between your fingers or a piece of material with slits, you might see colored patterns. I think this could be related to diffraction because a narrow slit is a classic example used to demonstrate diffraction. When light passes through a narrow slit, it spreads out and creates an interference pattern. If the light source is a fluorescent lamp, which emits white light with various wavelengths, the different colors would spread out by different amounts, creating colored stripes. So this seems like a diffraction phenomenon. But wait, could it also be interference? Because diffraction and interference are related. The diffraction through the slit creates a pattern, and if there are multiple slits, like in a diffraction grating, you get interference. But a single narrow slit would produce a diffraction pattern with a central bright fringe and dimmer ones on the sides. But when you look through a narrow slit at a lamp, maybe the slit acts as a diffraction grating if it's multiple slits? Or is it just a single slit? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If you have a single narrow slit, the diffraction pattern is a series of bright and dark fringes, but the colors might come from the different wavelengths. If the light source is white, like a fluorescent lamp, then each color would have its own diffraction pattern. So when you look through a narrow slit, you might see colored fringes because of the diffraction of different wavelengths. So maybe B is the correct answer.\n\nOption C: The mirage phenomenon. Mirages are caused by the refraction of light in layers of air with different temperatures and densities. When the air near the ground is very hot, it's less dense, so light bends as it passes through these layers. This can create the illusion of water on a road, for example. This is due to refraction and total internal reflection, not diffraction. So C is probably not the answer.\n\nOption D: Colorful stripes appear on soap bubbles under sunlight. Soap bubbles have a thin film of soapy water. When light hits the bubble, some of it reflects off the outer surface, and some goes through and reflects off the inner surface. The two reflected waves then interfere with each other. Depending on the thickness of the film and the wavelength of the light, you get constructive or destructive interference, leading to the colorful patterns. This is an example of thin-film interference, not diffraction. So D is interference, not diffraction.\n\nSo, going back to the options. A is refraction and dispersion, B is diffraction (if it's a single slit causing diffraction of different wavelengths), C is refraction, D is interference. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. When you look through a narrow slit at a light source, like a fluorescent lamp, are you seeing diffraction or just a simple dispersion? Because a fluorescent lamp emits light with different wavelengths, and if the slit is narrow, maybe it's acting like a prism? No, prisms work by refraction. But in this case, the slit is causing diffraction, and the different wavelengths diffract by different amounts. So the colored stripes are due to the diffraction of various wavelengths. Alternatively, if the slit is very narrow and you're looking at a point source, you might see a diffraction pattern. So yes, B is diffraction.\n\nAnother thought: a diffraction grating has many slits, and when light passes through, it creates interference patterns. But a single narrow slit also causes diffraction. So if the option is a narrow slit (single), then it's diffraction. If it's multiple slits, like a grating, it's interference. But the question says \"a narrow slit\", so it's a single slit. Therefore, B is diffraction. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
