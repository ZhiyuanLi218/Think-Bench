Tension and wavelength are not directly related; it's the wave speed that is directly affected by tension and indirectly affects wavelength.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what happens to the wavelength of standing waves in a string when the tension is increased. The original setup is a 100-Hz generator, and the string has a fixed length. Then the tension is increased, causing a new set of standing waves. The question is whether the new wavelength will be greater or less than the original.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts about waves on a string. The wave speed on a string is determined by the tension and the linear mass density of the string. The formula for the wave speed (v) is sqrt(T/μ), where T is the tension and μ is the linear mass density (mass per unit length). So if the tension increases, the wave speed should increase as well, right? Because T is in the numerator under the square root. So higher tension means higher wave speed.\n\nNow, standing waves on a string of fixed length depend on the wavelength. For a string fixed at both ends, the possible wavelengths are given by λ = 2L/n, where L is the length of the string and n is a positive integer (the harmonic number). The fundamental frequency (first harmonic) is when n=1, so λ = 2L. For higher harmonics, the wavelength gets shorter as n increases.\n\nBut in this case, the frequency of the generator is fixed at 100 Hz. So the frequency of the wave is determined by the generator. However, when the tension is changed, the wave speed changes, which would affect the wavelength because the wave speed is related to frequency and wavelength by the equation v = fλ. So if the frequency is fixed, and the wave speed increases, then the wavelength must increase as well because v is proportional to λ when f is constant. Wait, let me check that.\n\nYes, if v = fλ, and f is constant, then increasing v would require λ to increase. So if the wave speed increases (due to increased tension), and the frequency is fixed, the wavelength must increase. But how does this relate to the standing waves?\n\nThe standing waves form when the wavelength is such that an integer number of half-wavelengths fit into the string's length. So the possible wavelengths are determined by the length of the string. However, in this problem, the generator is providing a fixed frequency, so the system is being driven at that frequency. When the tension is increased, the wave speed increases, so the wavelength (which is v/f) must increase. Therefore, if the wavelength increases, but the string length is fixed, how does that affect the standing wave pattern?\n\nWait, the standing wave condition requires that the wavelength must satisfy the boundary conditions of the string. For a string of length L fixed at both ends, the possible wavelengths are λ = 2L/n. But if the wavelength is changing due to the wave speed changing (because of tension), then the harmonic number n must adjust to satisfy this condition.\n\nLet me think. Suppose originally, with tension T1, the wave speed is v1 = sqrt(T1/μ). The frequency is f = 100 Hz. So the original wavelength is λ1 = v1 / f. When the tension is increased to T2, the new wave speed is v2 = sqrt(T2/μ), which is higher. The new wavelength is λ2 = v2 / f. Since v2 > v1, λ2 > λ1. Therefore, the wavelength increases.\n\nBut how does this relate to the standing wave pattern? The standing waves require that the wavelength must fit into the string length. So if the wavelength increases, the number of nodes and antinodes (the harmonic number) must decrease. For example, if originally it was the nth harmonic, after increasing tension, maybe it becomes the (n-1)th harmonic because the wavelength is longer. But the question is about the wavelength of the new standing waves compared to the original.\n\nThe answer seems to hinge on the relationship between wave speed and wavelength when frequency is fixed. Since v = fλ, if v increases and f is constant, λ must increase. Therefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater than the original. So looking at the answer choices:\n\nA: Less, because... inverse with wavelength. But we said λ increases, so A is wrong.\n\nB: Greater, because... inverse with wavelength. Wait, if v increases and λ increases, then since v = fλ, if f is fixed, then v and λ are directly proportional. So B says \"varies inversely with the wavelength\" which would be incorrect. Wait, B says \"varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\" Wait, no. Let me parse the answer choices again.\n\nOption B: Greater, because the tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nWait, no. If tension increases, wave speed increases (directly, since v ~ sqrt(T)). Then if wave speed increases and frequency is fixed, wavelength must increase (since v = fλ). So wave speed and wavelength are directly proportional here. Therefore, the statement in B that \"varies inversely with the wavelength\" is incorrect. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: Greater, because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength. That seems correct. Because increasing tension increases wave speed, and with fixed frequency, wavelength increases. So C is correct?\n\nOption D: Less, because... directly with wavelength. No, since wavelength increases, D is wrong.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The answer choices are about the reasoning. So the correct reasoning is: tension increases, so wave speed increases. Since frequency is fixed (from the generator), wavelength must increase because v = fλ. Therefore, wavelength is directly proportional to wave speed when frequency is fixed. Therefore, the correct answer should be C: Greater, because the tension... varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength. Yes. So C is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the answer options again. The options are:\n\nA: Less, because the tension... varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nB: Greater, because... varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nC: Greater, because... varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nD: Less, because... varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nSo according to our reasoning, the correct answer is C. Because tension increases, wave speed increases (directly), and wavelength increases (directly with wave speed). Therefore, C is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the relationship between wave speed and wavelength. If the frequency is fixed, then v = fλ implies that λ = v/f. So if v increases, λ increases. So yes, directly proportional. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factors. For example, the standing wave condition. Suppose the original standing wave had a certain number of nodes. When tension is increased, the wave speed increases, so the wavelength increases. For the same string length, a longer wavelength would mean fewer nodes. For example, if originally it was the second harmonic (n=2), after increasing tension, it might become the first harmonic (n=1). But regardless, the wavelength is longer. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>"}
