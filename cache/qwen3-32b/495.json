The question is about sodium dissolving in liquid ammonia and forming a compound with a crown ether ligand, resulting in the first alkali metal anion, which is a golden-yellow compound [NaL⁺Na⁻]. The question asks which of the given statements is incorrect.\n\nFirst, let me recall what I know about sodium dissolving in liquid ammonia. I remember that when alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia, they form solvated electrons, which give the solution a deep blue color. At higher concentrations, the solutions turn bronze-colored and become metallic, with the formation of electron pairs. The solvated electrons are responsible for the electrical conductivity of the solution.\n\nNow, when a crown ether ligand L is added, the sodium ions (Na⁺) are complexed by the crown ether. Crown ethers are cyclic compounds with oxygen atoms that can bind cations, especially alkali metal cations. So, the ligand L would bind the Na⁺ ions, stabilizing them. The problem mentions that this leads to the formation of [NaL⁺Na⁻], which contains a sodium anion (Na⁻). That's interesting because sodium is typically a metal that forms cations, not anions. So, this compound is a sodium anion, which is unusual.\n\nNow, the question is about which statement is incorrect among the four options. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The radius of Na⁻ is larger than that of F⁻.\n\nHmm. Let's think about ionic radii. Sodium (Na) is in the third period, while fluorine (F) is in the second. Normally, Na⁺ is larger than F⁻ because Na⁺ is in the third period and F⁻ is in the second, but when comparing anions, the size depends on the charge and the period. Wait, but here we have Na⁻ versus F⁻. Wait, sodium normally forms Na⁺, but here it's Na⁻. Let me think. \n\nThe ionic radius generally increases when moving down a group and with increasing negative charge. For isoelectronic ions, the one with the higher negative charge is larger. But Na⁻ is not isoelectronic with F⁻. Let's see. F⁻ has 10 electrons (same as Ne), and Na⁻ would have 12 electrons (same as Ne plus two more, so same as Mg? Wait, no. Let me check. Sodium has atomic number 11. Na⁻ would have 12 electrons, which is the same as Mg²+? No, Mg²+ has 10 electrons. Wait, no. Let me think again. Neutral Na has 11 electrons. Na⁻ would have 12 electrons. So, it's isoelectronic with Mg (which has 12 electrons in neutral form), but Mg²+ would have 10. So, Na⁻ is isoelectronic with Mg. But Mg is in the same period as Na. Wait, sodium is period 3. Mg is also period 3. So Na⁻ has 12 electrons, same as neutral Mg. But Mg neutral has a larger atomic radius than Na neutral. But ionic radius... Wait, but Na⁻ is an anion. How does its size compare to F⁻?\n\nF⁻ has a smaller ionic radius than Na⁺ because F⁻ is in period 2 and Na⁺ is in period 3. But here we are comparing Na⁻ (which is a larger anion) to F⁻. Let me think. If Na⁻ has an extra electron compared to Na, making it larger than Na atom. Similarly, F⁻ is larger than F atom. But since Na is in a lower period than F, even as an anion, Na⁻ should be larger than F⁻. Because ionic radius increases down the group. For example, O²- is larger than F⁻, which is larger than N³-? Wait, no. Let me recall the order. In the same period, for anions, the size increases with increasing negative charge. But across periods, moving down, the ionic radius increases. So F⁻ is in period 2, Na⁻ would be in period 3. So Na⁻ should have a larger ionic radius than F⁻. Therefore, statement A is correct. So option A is correct, so it's not the incorrect one we are looking for.\n\nOption B: The reducing power of Na⁻ is stronger than that of Na.\n\nReducing power refers to the ability to donate electrons. A stronger reducing agent is more likely to be oxidized (lose electrons). So, if Na⁻ is a stronger reducing agent than Na, that would mean Na⁻ is more likely to lose electrons than Na. But wait, Na normally loses electrons to form Na⁺. Na⁻ is a sodium ion with a negative charge, meaning it has an extra electron. So if Na⁻ is a reducing agent, it would tend to lose that extra electron to become Na or Na⁺. Whereas Na metal can lose an electron to become Na⁺. \n\nSo, comparing the reducing power of Na⁻ vs Na. Let's think in terms of electron donation. The reducing power is related to the tendency to lose electrons. If Na⁻ is more willing to lose electrons than Na, then it's a stronger reducing agent. \n\nBut Na⁻ has an extra electron. Let's consider the ionization energy. To lose an electron from Na⁻ would require the first ionization energy of Na⁻? Wait, no. Wait, the reducing power is about how easily the substance can be oxidized. For Na, oxidation is losing an electron: Na → Na⁺ + e⁻. For Na⁻, oxidation would be losing two electrons: Na⁻ → Na⁺ + 2e⁻. But perhaps we can think of the relative ease. \n\nAlternatively, think about the standard reduction potentials. The more negative the reduction potential, the stronger the reducing agent. But I don't remember the exact values for Na⁻. However, let's think logically. Na⁻ has an extra electron, so it's more likely to lose an electron compared to Na metal? Because Na⁻ is already an anion; it's more likely to lose electrons to return to a more stable state. For example, if you have a negative ion, it's more likely to act as a reducing agent because it can lose electrons. Whereas Na metal is neutral and can lose an electron to become Na⁺. \n\nBut is Na⁻ a stronger reducing agent than Na? Let me think. For example, compare Na and Na⁻. Suppose we have Na⁻ and Na. Which one is more likely to lose an electron? Since Na⁻ has an extra electron, it might have a lower ionization energy compared to Na. Wait, no. Wait, the ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron. For Na, the first ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from Na to form Na⁺. For Na⁻, the first ionization energy would be the energy required to remove an electron from Na⁻ to form Na. The second ionization energy of Na would be removing another electron from Na⁺ to form Na²+. \n\nBut the ionization energy of Na⁻ (to remove an electron and make Na) is actually the electron affinity of Na? Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of electron gain and loss. Let me recall that the electron affinity is the energy released when an electron is added. The ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron. \n\nFor Na⁻, removing an electron would give Na, which is neutral. The energy required for this would be related to the electron affinity of Na. Wait, but electron affinity is usually the energy change when an electron is added to a neutral atom. So for Na, the electron affinity is the energy released when Na + e⁻ → Na⁻. The reverse process would be the ionization energy of Na⁻ to Na. \n\nSo, if the electron affinity of Na is negative (which it is, but not very high), then the ionization energy of Na⁻ to remove an electron would be a positive value, but maybe not too high. \n\nBut how does this compare to the first ionization energy of Na? The first ionization energy of Na is the energy required to remove an electron from Na to make Na⁺. \n\nSince Na⁻ is an anion, it's more willing to lose that extra electron compared to Na metal. Therefore, the reducing power of Na⁻ would be stronger than Na, because Na⁻ can more easily lose electrons. Therefore, statement B says that the reducing power of Na⁻ is stronger than that of Na. That would be correct. So statement B is correct. Therefore, option B is not the incorrect one.\n\nOption C: The first ionization energy of Na⁻ is greater than that of H⁻.\n\nFirst ionization energy is the energy required to remove the first electron from an atom or ion. So, we need to compare the first ionization energy of Na⁻ with that of H⁻. \n\nH⁻ is a hydrogen ion with an extra electron, so it's isoelectronic with helium. The first ionization energy of H⁻ would be the energy required to remove an electron from H⁻ to form H. \n\nSimilarly, for Na⁻, the first ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from Na⁻ to form Na. \n\nWhich of these two requires more energy? \n\nH⁻ has a very high ionization energy because it's isoelectronic with He, which has a high ionization energy. The ionization energy of H⁻ would be similar to the electron affinity of H, but in reverse. Wait, the electron affinity of H is the energy released when adding an electron to H to form H⁻. The ionization energy of H⁻ would be the energy required to remove that electron. \n\nBut comparing to Na⁻, which is a much larger ion. The effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electron in Na⁻ is lower than in H⁻. Because Na⁻ is in a higher period, with more electron shells, so the outer electron is farther from the nucleus and shielded more. Therefore, it would require less energy to remove an electron from Na⁻ compared to H⁻. Therefore, the first ionization energy of Na⁻ should be less than that of H⁻. \n\nBut the statement says that the first ionization energy of Na⁻ is greater than that of H⁻. If our reasoning is correct, that would be incorrect. Therefore, statement C is incorrect, which would make option C the incorrect statement. But let's check this again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the actual values. The first ionization energy of H⁻ would be the same as the electron affinity of H but in reverse. The electron affinity of H is about -0.75 eV (exothermic), so the ionization energy of H⁻ would be +0.75 eV. \n\nFor Na⁻, the first ionization energy would be the energy required to remove an electron from Na⁻ to form Na. This is similar to the electron affinity of Na but in reverse. The electron affinity of Na is about -52.8 kJ/mol (which is roughly -0.55 eV). So the ionization energy of Na⁻ would be +0.55 eV. \n\nComparing these, H⁻ has a higher first ionization energy (0.75 eV) than Na⁻ (0.55 eV). Therefore, statement C claims that Na⁻'s first ionization energy is greater than H⁻, which is false. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. So option C is the incorrect statement. \n\nBut wait, let me check if I'm mixing up the terms. First ionization energy is the energy needed to remove an electron. So if H⁻ has a higher value, that means it's harder to remove an electron from H⁻ compared to Na⁻. Therefore, the statement says that Na⁻ has a greater first ionization energy than H⁻, which would mean it's harder to remove an electron from Na⁻ than from H⁻. But according to our previous reasoning, it's easier to remove an electron from Na⁻ than from H⁻, so the first ionization energy of Na⁻ is less than that of H⁻. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. So option C is the incorrect one. \n\nOption D: This fact indicates that Na can also exhibit non-metallic properties.\n\nWell, normally sodium is a metal, forming cations. But here, sodium is forming an anion, Na⁻, which is a characteristic of non-metals. Non-metals typically gain electrons to form anions. So the formation of Na⁻ suggests that sodium can exhibit non-metallic behavior in certain circumstances, like under high pressure or in specific chemical environments (like with crown ethers stabilizing the anion). Therefore, statement D is correct. So option D is not the incorrect one.\n\nSo the incorrect statement is option C. Therefore, the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, let me just check again. Let me think about the first ionization energy of Na⁻ versus H⁻. \n\nH⁻ has an electron configuration of 1s². To remove an electron from H⁻, you're removing one of the two 1s electrons. The ionization energy here is similar to the ionization energy of helium, but helium has a higher nuclear charge (Z=2) compared to H⁻ (Z=1). Wait, H⁻ has a nucleus with charge +1, and two electrons. The ionization energy would be lower than that of helium, which has Z=2 and two electrons. The first ionization energy of helium is about 24.6 eV. But H⁻ is a hydrogen ion with an extra electron. The ionization energy of H⁻ is actually lower than that of neutral hydrogen. Wait, no. The ionization energy of neutral H is 13.6 eV. The ionization energy of H⁻ would be less because it's easier to remove an electron from a negative ion. In fact, the electron affinity of H is negative (exothermic), meaning that adding an electron to H is exothermic. Therefore, removing an electron from H⁻ would require less energy than removing an electron from H. Wait, but the first ionization energy of H⁻ is the energy required to remove an electron from H⁻, giving H. Whereas the first ionization energy of H is removing an electron from H to give H⁺. \n\nSo the first ionization energy of H is 13.6 eV. The first ionization energy of H⁻ would be lower than that. For example, if the electron affinity of H is -0.75 eV (meaning adding an electron to H releases 0.75 eV), then the ionization energy of H⁻ would be +0.75 eV. So, removing an electron from H⁻ requires 0.75 eV, which is much less than the 13.6 eV required to remove an electron from neutral H. \n\nFor Na⁻, the first ionization energy (removing an electron to form Na) would be related to the electron affinity of Na. The electron affinity of Na is -52.8 kJ/mol, which is about -0.55 eV. Therefore, the ionization energy of Na⁻ would be +0.55 eV. Comparing to H⁻'s ionization energy of +0.55 eV vs H⁻'s +0.75 eV? Wait, earlier I said H⁻ is 0.75 eV. But I need to check exact numbers. \n\nActually, the exact value for the electron affinity of hydrogen is approximately -0.75 eV, so the ionization energy of H⁻ would be +0.75 eV. For sodium, the electron affinity is about -52.8 kJ/mol. Let me convert that to eV. 1 eV per mole is approximately 96.485 kJ/mol. So -52.8 kJ/mol divided by 96.485 kJ/mol per eV is roughly -0.547 eV. Therefore, the ionization energy of Na⁻ is +0.547 eV. \n\nTherefore, the first ionization energy of Na⁻ is about 0.55 eV, and that of H⁻ is about 0.75 eV. Therefore, the first ionization energy of Na⁻ is less than that of H⁻. Therefore, statement C says it's greater, which is incorrect. So option C is incorrect. \n\nThus, the incorrect statement is option C. So the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
