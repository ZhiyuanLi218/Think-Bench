I need to find the probability of getting 0 for observable P and then -1 for observable Q when measured sequentially. The system's state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but column matrices are usually normalized, right? Let me check if this state is normalized. The norm would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which isn't 1. Hmm, so maybe the state vector is not normalized. But in quantum mechanics, states should be normalized. Maybe I need to normalize it first? Let me confirm.\n\nThe problem says the state is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Maybe they just present it without normalization? So I need to normalize it before proceeding. Let me do that. The normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩.\n\nNow, the first measurement is of observable P. The operator P is given by the matrix:\n\n[ 0       1/√2     0     ]\n[1/√2    0       1/√2   ]\n[ 0       1/√2    0     ]\n\nAnd operator Q is:\n\n[1  0   0]\n[0  0   0]\n[0  0  -1]\n\nSo first, we measure P, then Q. The question is asking for the probability that P gives 0 and then Q gives -1. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses to an eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue obtained. So first, we need to find the possible eigenvalues of P, then find the probability of measuring 0, then collapse the state, and then measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.\n\nBut the problem is phrased as: \"if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?\" So it's the joint probability of first getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q. So the total probability is the probability of getting 0 in P multiplied by the probability of then getting -1 in Q given that the state has collapsed to the eigenstate corresponding to P=0.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n2. Determine the probability of measuring each eigenvalue of P in the initial state.\n3. For the eigenvalue 0, find the corresponding eigenstate(s), project the initial state onto that subspace, normalize it.\n4. Then compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 in that collapsed state.\n\nBut first, let's handle the first part: finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nGiven the matrix for P:\n\nP = [\n    [0, 1/√2, 0],\n    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n    [0, 1/√2, 0]\n]\n\nThis looks like a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.\n\nLet me compute its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.\n\nSo:\n\n| -λ       1/√2      0     |\n|1/√2    -λ       1/√2   |\n| 0       1/√2    -λ     | = 0\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-λ * det[ -λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ ] - (1/√2) * det[1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ ] + 0 * det(...) \n\nFirst term: -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] = -λ [ λ² - 1/2 ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] = - (1/√2) * [ -λ / √2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2)( -λ / √2 ) = (λ / 2 )\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo overall determinant:\n\n-λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = -λ³ + (λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 → λ = 0 or λ² = 1 → λ = 0, 1, -1.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nNow, for each eigenvalue, find the eigenvectors.\n\nStarting with λ = 1:\n\n(P - I)v = 0:\n\nMatrix P - I:\n\n[\n-1, 1/√2, 0\n1/√2, -1, 1/√2\n0, 1/√2, -1\n]\n\nLet me write equations:\n\n-1*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0\n\n(1/√2)*v1 -1*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0\n\n0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 -1*v3 = 0\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nFrom the third equation: (1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0 → v3 = (1/√2) v2\n\nFrom the first equation: -v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2\n\nLet me set v2 = √2 to make calculations easier. Then:\n\nv1 = (1/√2)(√2) = 1\n\nv3 = (1/√2)(√2) = 1\n\nTherefore, eigenvector is (1, √2, 1). But let's check normalization. Let me see, but actually, we can just write the eigenvector up to a scalar multiple. Alternatively, maybe I can use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote the eigenvector as (a, b, c). From the first equation:\n\n- a + (b)/√2 = 0 → a = b / √2\n\nThird equation: (b)/√2 - c = 0 → c = b / √2\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is (b/√2, b, b/√2). Let me factor out b/√2:\n\nLet me write it as b/√2 * (1, √2, 1). So the eigenvector can be taken as (1, √2, 1). To normalize this vector:\n\nCompute its norm squared: 1² + (√2)² + 1² = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Therefore, norm is 2. So normalized eigenvector is (1/2, √2/2, 1/2) or (1/2, 1/√2, 1/2). Wait:\n\nWait, if original vector is (1, √2, 1), then dividing by 2 gives norm 1. So yes, normalized eigenvector for λ=1 is (1/2, √2/2, 1/2). Alternatively, written as fractions:\n\n(1/2, (√2)/2, 1/2). Let me check:\n\n(1/2)^2 + ( (√2)/2 )^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 2/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for λ = -1:\n\n(P + I)v = 0:\n\nMatrix P + I:\n\n[\n1, 1/√2, 0\n1/√2, 1, 1/√2\n0, 1/√2, 1\n]\n\nEquations:\n\n1*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0\n\n(1/√2)*v1 + 1*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0\n\n0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 1*v3 = 0\n\nFrom the third equation: (1/√2) v2 + v3 = 0 → v3 = - (1/√2) v2\n\nFrom the first equation: v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v1 = - (1/√2) v2\n\nLet me set v2 = √2, then:\n\nv1 = - (1/√2)(√2) = -1\n\nv3 = - (1/√2)(√2) = -1\n\nTherefore, eigenvector is (-1, √2, -1). Let me check normalization. The vector is (-1, √2, -1). Its norm squared is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So normalized eigenvector is (-1/2, √2/2, -1/2). Which is similar to the previous case.\n\nFor λ = 0:\n\n(P - 0*I)v = Pv = 0:\n\nMatrix P:\n\n[\n0, 1/√2, 0\n1/√2, 0, 1/√2\n0, 1/√2, 0\n]\n\nSo equations:\n\n(1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0\n\n(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (v1 + v3)/√2 = 0 → v1 = -v3\n\nThird equation same as first: (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors of the form (a, 0, -a). So direction is (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace for λ=0 is two-dimensional? Wait, no. Wait, for a 3x3 matrix, with three eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. The eigenvalue 0 should have multiplicity 1? Wait, determinant was -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1) = 0. So three distinct eigenvalues, each with multiplicity 1. Therefore, the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional. Wait, but according to the equations above, v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). Therefore, the eigenvector for λ=0 is (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it. The norm squared is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. Therefore, normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nSo to recap:\n\nEigenvalues of P:\n\n-1, 0, 1\n\nCorresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n\nFor λ = -1: (-1/2, √2/2, -1/2)\n\nFor λ = 0: (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)\n\nFor λ = 1: (1/2, √2/2, 1/2)\n\nOkay, so now, the initial state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ] normalized as [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ].\n\nFirst, we measure P. The possible outcomes are -1, 0, 1. The probability of each outcome is the square of the projection of |ψ⟩ onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nSo let's compute the probability of measuring 0 for P first.\n\nThe projection of |ψ⟩ onto the eigenvector for λ=0, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nCompute the inner product:\n\n⟨φ_0 | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6)\n\n= [ -1/(√2√6) - 1/(√2√6) ] = -2/(√12) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\n\nTherefore, the probability is |⟨φ_0 | ψ⟩|² = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 for P is 1/3. Then, after measuring 0, the state collapses to the eigenstate |φ_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this collapsed state and find the probability of getting -1.\n\nFirst, let's recall the operator Q:\n\nQ = [\n[1, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, -1]\n]\n\nSo Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. Therefore, its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, with corresponding eigenvectors the standard basis vectors.\n\nTherefore, measuring Q on a state |φ⟩ gives the eigenvalue corresponding to the standard basis vector it projects onto. The probability of getting eigenvalue q is |⟨e_q | φ⟩|², where |e_q⟩ is the eigenvector of Q corresponding to q.\n\nIn particular, the eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the third standard basis vector |e3⟩ = (0, 0, 1). Wait, but our collapsed state after measuring P=0 is |φ_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So to find the probability of measuring -1 for Q, we compute the square of the inner product between |φ_0⟩ and |e3⟩.\n\n⟨e3 | φ_0⟩ = 0*1/√2 + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2. Therefore, the probability is | -1/√2 |² = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of first measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is the product of the two probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. The first probability is 1/3 for measuring 0 in P. Then, given that collapse, the probability of measuring -1 in Q is 1/2. So total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. Which is option A. But let me verify my calculations again step by step to make sure.\n\nFirst, normalization of initial state:\n\nOriginal vector: (-1, 2, 1). Norm squared is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So normalized is indeed divided by sqrt(6). Correct.\n\nEigenvalues of P: -1, 0, 1. Correct.\n\nEigenvectors for P:\n\nFor λ=0: (1, 0, -1). Normalized: 1/√(1 + 0 + 1) = 1/√2. So (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Correct.\n\nInner product with |ψ⟩:\n\n(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = [ -1/(√2√6) - 1/(√2√6) ] = -2/(√12) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3. Squared magnitude is 1/3. Correct.\n\nCollapsed state is |φ_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Now measuring Q.\n\nOperator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. Therefore, the eigenstates are standard basis vectors. The probability of measuring -1 is the square of the amplitude in the third component. The third component of |φ_0⟩ is -1/√2. Therefore, probability is (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. Which is option A. So the answer is A: 1/6.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way this could be approached. For example, maybe using projection operators?\n\nAlternatively, the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q is equal to the expectation value of the projection operator for Q=-1 after P=0, multiplied by the probability of P=0. But that's essentially what I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the total probability by first applying the projection for P=0, then the projection for Q=-1, and taking the squared norm?\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nThe initial state is |ψ⟩. The probability is || P_0 Q_-1 |ψ⟩ ||²? Wait, no. Because measurements are sequential. The correct way is:\n\nFirst, the probability is || P_0 |ψ⟩ ||² * || Q_-1 |φ_0⟩ ||², where |φ_0⟩ is P_0 |ψ⟩ normalized.\n\nBut since P and Q may not commute, we can't just combine them. However, in this case, since after measuring P, the state is projected, then measuring Q.\n\nAlternatively, the total probability can be calculated as:\n\n⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩ ?\n\nWait, no. Because after measuring P, the state is projected onto P_0's subspace, then Q is measured. The total probability is:\n\nTr[ Q_-1 P_0 |ψ⟩⟨ψ| P_0 ] ?\n\nBut since P_0 is a projection, and Q_-1 is another projection, maybe?\n\nBut since we are dealing with pure states and projective measurements, the probability is:\n\n⟨ψ | P_0 | ψ ⟩ * ⟨φ_0 | Q_-1 | φ_0 ⟩, which is exactly what I calculated before, 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to write it as ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩ ?\n\nWait, since after projecting with P_0, the state is P_0 |ψ⟩ / sqrt(⟨ψ | P_0 | ψ ⟩). Then measuring Q_-1 would give probability ⟨ψ | P_0 | ψ ⟩^{-1} ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩. Therefore, total probability is ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, P_0 is the projection onto the eigenvector for P=0, which is |φ_0⟩⟨φ_0|. So P_0 = |φ_0⟩⟨φ_0|.\n\nSimilarly, Q_-1 is the projection onto |e3⟩⟨e3|.\n\nTherefore, P_0 Q_-1 P_0 is |φ_0⟩⟨φ_0| e3⟩⟨e3 | φ_0⟩⟨φ_0|.\n\nBut since Q_-1 is |e3⟩⟨e3|, then P_0 Q_-1 P_0 is P_0 |e3⟩⟨e3| P_0. However, since P_0 is rank 1, this becomes ⟨e3 | φ_0⟩ |φ_0⟩⟨φ_0| e3⟩ ⟨e3| ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩.\n\nWhich is ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩ = ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩. Since P_0 is a projection, this is ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩ = ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩. But since P_0 Q_-1 P_0 = |φ_0⟩⟨φ_0| Q_-1 |φ_0⟩⟨φ_0| = |φ_0⟩⟨φ_0| Q_-1 |φ_0⟩ ⟨φ_0|.\n\nSince Q_-1 |φ_0⟩ = ⟨e3 | φ_0 ⟩ |e3⟩ = (-1/√2) |e3⟩.\n\nTherefore, ⟨φ_0| Q_-1 |φ_0⟩ = ⟨φ_0 | e3 ⟩ ⟨e3 | φ_0 ⟩ = |⟨e3 | φ_0 ⟩|² = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, P_0 Q_-1 P_0 = |φ_0⟩ ⟨φ_0| Q_-1 |φ_0⟩ ⟨φ_0| = (1/2) |φ_0⟩⟨φ_0|.\n\nTherefore, ⟨ψ | P_0 Q_-1 P_0 | ψ ⟩ = (1/2) ⟨ψ | P_0 | ψ ⟩ = (1/2)(1/3) = 1/6. Same result. So this confirms the answer is 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1/6.\n\nBut let me check once more for any possible miscalculations. For example, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvectors?\n\nLet me recheck the inner product ⟨φ_0 | ψ⟩.\n\nφ_0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). ψ is (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6).\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/√12 - 1/√12 = -2/√12 = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/√3. Squared magnitude is 1/3. Correct.\n\nThen, for the state |φ_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the square of the third component, which is (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Correct.\n\nSo yes, 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So answer A.\n\nBut let me check if the question is perhaps about compatible observables or something else? But since we are measuring P first then Q, the order matters. Also, since the problem says \"measures Q just after the measurement of P\", so the collapse happens after measuring P.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another interpretation where you measure both simultaneously? But no, because they are sequential measurements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the probability that P has eigenvalue 0 and Q has eigenvalue -1 in the original state? But that would be different. However, in quantum mechanics, if you measure non-commuting observables, you can't get the joint probability unless they commute. Since P and Q don't commute (probably), you can't have a simultaneous eigenstate. But the question is about sequential measurement: first P, then Q. So the way I did it is correct.\n\nJust to check if P and Q commute. Let me compute [P, Q] = PQ - QP.\n\nFirst, compute PQ and QP.\n\nFirst, write down P and Q:\n\nP:\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nQ:\n\n[1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, -1]\n\nCompute PQ:\n\nFirst row:\n\nFirst element: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 = 0\n\nSecond element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 = 0\n\nThird element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication:\n\nWait, PQ is P multiplied by Q. Let me compute each element.\n\nFirst row of P times columns of Q.\n\nFirst row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nFirst column of Q: [1, 0, 0]^T. So 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 = 0.\n\nSecond column of Q: [0, 0, 0]^T. 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 = 0.\n\nThird column of Q: [0, 0, -1]^T. 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nTherefore, first row of PQ is [0, 0, 0].\n\nSecond row of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n\nMultiply by columns of Q:\n\nFirst column: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 = 1/√2\n\nSecond column: (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 = 0\n\nThird column: (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = -1/√2\n\nThird row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nMultiply by columns of Q:\n\nFirst column: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 = 0\n\nSecond column: 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 = 0\n\nThird column: 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\n\nTherefore, PQ is:\n\n[\n[0, 0, 0],\n[1/√2, 0, -1/√2],\n[0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nNow compute QP:\n\nQ multiplied by P.\n\nQ is diagonal, so QP is Q times P element-wise for rows? Wait no, matrix multiplication.\n\nFirst row of Q is [1, 0, 0], multiply by P:\n\nFirst row: [1*0 + 0*1/√2 + 0*0, 1*1/√2 + 0*0 + 0*1/√2, 1*0 + 0*1/√2 + 0*0] = [0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nSecond row of Q is [0, 0, 0], multiplied by P gives all zeros.\n\nThird row of Q is [0, 0, -1], multiplied by P:\n\nThird row: [0*0 + 0*1/√2 + (-1)*0, 0*1/√2 + 0*0 + (-1)*1/√2, 0*0 + 0*1/√2 + (-1)*0] = [0, -1/√2, 0]\n\nTherefore, QP is:\n\n[\n[0, 1/√2, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, -1/√2, 0]\n]\n\nCompare with PQ:\n\n[\n[0, 0, 0],\n[1/√2, 0, -1/√2],\n[0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nClearly PQ ≠ QP, so [P, Q] ≠ 0. Therefore, they don't commute, so sequential measurement order matters. Therefore, my approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/6, option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
