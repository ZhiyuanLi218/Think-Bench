Let me start by recalling what I know about polarity in bonds. Polar bonds occur when there's a difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved. The more electronegative atom will have a partial negative charge (δ-), and the less electronegative one will have a partial positive charge (δ+).\n\nThe question is asking which of the given bonds has the negative end written last. So, in each option, the bond is written as Atom1—Atom2, and we need to determine if Atom2 is more electronegative than Atom1. If that's the case, then the negative end is indeed written last, and that would be the correct answer. If not, then the negative end is the first atom.\n\nLet me list out the options again:\n\nA: O—S  \nB: Br—N  \nC: N—C  \nD: P—Cl\n\nNow, I need to recall the electronegativity values for each of these elements. Electronegativity generally increases as you move across a period in the periodic table and decreases as you move down a group. Let me try to remember the order or maybe look up the approximate values.\n\nElectronegativity values (Pauling scale):\n\n- Oxygen (O): around 3.44  \n- Sulfur (S): around 2.58  \n- Bromine (Br): around 2.96  \n- Nitrogen (N): around 3.04  \n- Carbon (C): around 2.55  \n- Phosphorus (P): around 2.19  \n- Chlorine (Cl): around 3.16  \n\nLet me verify these values to make sure I'm not mixing them up. For example, I know that F is the most electronegative (around 4.0), then O, then Cl, then N, then Br, then S, and P is less. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, from standard tables:\n\n- Fluorine (F): 3.98  \n- Oxygen (O): 3.44  \n- Chlorine (Cl): 3.16  \n- Nitrogen (N): 3.04  \n- Bromine (Br): 2.96  \n- Iodine (I): 2.66  \n- Sulfur (S): 2.58  \n- Carbon (C): 2.55  \n- Phosphorus (P): 2.19  \n- Hydrogen (H): 2.20  \n\nOkay, so with that in mind, let's go through each option.\n\nOption A: O—S  \nOxygen (3.44) vs. Sulfur (2.58). Oxygen is more electronegative, so the negative end is O. In the bond written as O—S, the negative end is the first atom. Therefore, the negative end is NOT written last here. So A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: Br—N  \nBromine (2.96) vs. Nitrogen (3.04). Nitrogen is more electronegative. So the negative end is N, which is the second atom in the bond (Br—N). Therefore, the negative end is written last here. So B could be a candidate.\n\nOption C: N—C  \nNitrogen (3.04) vs. Carbon (2.55). Nitrogen is more electronegative, so the negative end is N, which is the first atom. Therefore, the negative end is not written last here. So C is not the answer.\n\nOption D: P—Cl  \nPhosphorus (2.19) vs. Chlorine (3.16). Chlorine is more electronegative, so the negative end is Cl, which is the second atom in the bond. Therefore, the negative end is written last here. So D is also a candidate.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options has the negative end written last. Both B and D seem to satisfy that. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here? Let me check again.\n\nFor B: Br (2.96) vs. N (3.04). Since 3.04 > 2.96, N is more electronegative. So in Br—N, N is δ- and Br is δ+. Therefore, the negative end is N, which is written last. Correct.\n\nFor D: P (2.19) vs. Cl (3.16). Cl is more electronegative, so in P—Cl, Cl is δ- and P is δ+. So negative end is Cl, written last. Correct.\n\nSo both B and D have the negative end written last. However, the options are A, B, C, D. The question says \"which of the following\", implying only one correct answer. Wait, maybe I miscalculated something?\n\nWait, let me check the electronegativity values again. Let me cross-verify.\n\nNitrogen: 3.04  \nBromine: 2.96  \nYes, so N is more electronegative than Br. So in Br—N bond, the more electronegative atom is N, so the dipole points towards N. So the negative end is N, written last. Correct.\n\nChlorine is 3.16, Phosphorus is 2.19. So Cl is more electronegative. In P—Cl bond, Cl is δ-, so written last. Correct.\n\nSo both B and D have the negative end written last. But the options are A, B, C, D. The question is probably expecting only one correct answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the electronegativity values? Let me check another source or my memory again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a textbook or a standard test where maybe there's a specific answer expected. Let me think. Maybe I should check if the bonds are written in a particular order. For example, sometimes in certain contexts, the more electronegative atom is written second, but here the question is about which bond has the negative end written last. So if the more electronegative atom is written second, then that bond would have the negative end last. So the correct answers would be those where the second atom is more electronegative.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nA: O—S. O is more electronegative, so written first. So negative end is first. Not correct.\n\nB: Br—N. N is more electronegative, written second. Correct.\n\nC: N—C. N is more electronegative, written first. Not correct.\n\nD: P—Cl. Cl is more electronegative, written second. Correct.\n\nSo both B and D are correct. But the options are presented as A, B, C, D. The question is likely multiple choice with only one correct answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the electronegativity of Br?\n\nWait, let me check electronegativity values again. From the Pauling scale:\n\n- Br: 2.96  \n- N: 3.04  \nYes, so N is more electronegative than Br. So Br—N bond, the more electronegative atom is N, so it's written second, so negative end is last. Correct.\n\nCl is 3.16, P is 2.19. So Cl is more electronegative. So P—Cl bond, Cl is written second, so negative end is last. Correct.\n\nSo both B and D. However, if the question is from a source that expects only one answer, maybe I need to check if there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the direction of the dipole moment. In the bond notation, sometimes the direction is indicated with an arrow. But the question is about writing the negative end last. So if the more electronegative atom is written second, then the negative end is last.\n\nBut if both B and D are correct, but the options don't allow multiple answers, then perhaps I need to check if there's an error in my electronegativity values.\n\nWait, let me check another source for electronegativity values. Let me recall that:\n\nElectronegativity values (Pauling):\n\n- F: 3.98  \n- O: 3.44  \n- Cl: 3.16  \n- N: 3.04  \n- Br: 2.96  \n- I: 2.66  \n- S: 2.58  \n- C: 2.55  \n- P: 2.19  \n- H: 2.20  \n\nYes, that's consistent with standard values. So N (3.04) is more electronegative than Br (2.96). Cl (3.16) is more than P (2.19). Therefore, both B and D are correct. But if the question is presented as a single-answer multiple choice, then there might be an error in the question, or perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, looking back at the original question: \"In which of the following is the negative end of the bond written last?\" So it's possible that the question is from a source where only one answer is correct. Let me check again each bond.\n\nOption B: Br—N. Br is 2.96, N is 3.04. So N is more electronegative. So in Br—N bond, N is δ- and Br is δ+. So the negative end is N, written last. Correct.\n\nOption D: P—Cl. Cl is more electronegative, so Cl is δ- and P is δ+. So negative end is Cl, written last. Correct.\n\nSo both B and D are correct. However, the options given are A, B, C, D. If the question allows multiple answers, but it's presented as a single-answer question, perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source where only one is considered correct, perhaps based on another factor.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to the entire molecule's dipole moment, but the question specifically says \"the negative end of the bond\", so it's about individual bonds, not molecules. So each bond's polarity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a textbook where the answer is only one of them. Let me check if there's a standard way to write bonds. Typically, in chemical notation, the more electronegative atom is written second. For example, in HCl, Cl is written second because it's more electronegative. Similarly, in CO, O is written second. So in that case, both B and D follow that convention. But the question is asking which of these has the negative end written last, which would be the same as the more electronegative atom being written second. Therefore, both B and D.\n\nBut the options are given as single choices. Maybe the question is from a source that expects only one correct answer, and perhaps there's a mistake in the options. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the electronegativity of Br vs. N.\n\nWait, let me double-check the electronegativity of Br and N. According to the Pauling scale:\n\n- Nitrogen: 3.04  \n- Bromine: 2.96  \n\nYes, so N is more electronegative than Br. Therefore, in Br—N bond, the more electronegative atom is N, which is written second. So the negative end is last. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Cl is more electronegative than P, so in P—Cl bond, Cl is written second, so negative end is last. Correct.\n\nTherefore, if both B and D are correct, but the question is presented as having only one correct answer, then there might be an error. However, since the user has provided the options as A, B, C, D, and the question is likely expecting one answer, perhaps I need to check if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the entire molecule's dipole moment, but the question specifically says \"the negative end of the bond\", not the molecule. So it's about the bond's polarity. For example, in a molecule like Br—N, the bond dipole points towards N. So the negative end is N, written last. Similarly, P—Cl bond dipole points towards Cl, written last.\n\nTherefore, both B and D are correct. However, if the options are presented as single-answer, perhaps the intended answer is D: P—Cl. Maybe the question assumes that the more electronegative atom is always written second, and the options are designed to have only one correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the electronegativity of Br and N.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the answer is D. Let me check some examples. For instance, in the bond between P and Cl, Cl is more electronegative, so P—Cl is correct. In Br and N, N is more electronegative, so Br—N is also correct. So both B and D are correct. But if the options don't allow multiple answers, perhaps the question is flawed. However, since the user is asking for an answer, and given that both B and D are correct, but the options are single-choice, I might need to check if there's another factor.\n\nWait, maybe the question is from a textbook or a specific context where only one is correct. For example, sometimes in certain contexts, like in ionic vs. covalent bonds, but the question doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different scale for electronegativity. But I think the Pauling scale is standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the order in the periodic table. For example, in Br—N, Br is a halogen, and N is a chalcogen? No, N is in group 15. Br is in group 17. So Cl is in group 17, P is in group 15. But I don't think that affects the electronegativity comparison.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where the answer is D, and the B option is a trick because Br is a halogen, and N is also more electronegative. But according to the numbers, both B and D are correct. However, since the user has given this question, and it's likely expecting one answer, perhaps I should check if there's any other consideration.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the direction of the dipole moment in the bond. For example, in some cases, the dipole moment is considered as pointing towards the negative end. But the notation of the bond doesn't indicate direction, just the atoms involved. So the question is simply about which bond has the more electronegative atom written second. So both B and D are correct. But since the options are A, B, C, D, and the user might expect one answer, perhaps the intended answer is D: P—Cl.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the answer is B, and there's a mistake in the electronegativity of Br and N. But according to standard values, N is more electronegative than Br. For example, the electronegativity of Br is approximately 2.96, and N is 3.04, so indeed N is more electronegative. Therefore, both B and D are correct.\n\nHowever, since the options are presented as single-choice, I might have to consider that perhaps the question has a typo, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-English source or uses a different scale. But I think the Pauling scale is standard.\n\nGiven that, I think both B and D are correct. But if forced to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is D: P—Cl. Maybe the question assumes that the more electronegative atom is always written second, and the options are designed to have only one correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where the answer is B. But based on the electronegativity values, both B and D are correct.\n\nWait, let me check if the question is from a specific textbook or exam. Since I don't have that context, I have to rely on the standard electronegativity values. Therefore, I think both B and D are correct. However, since the user is asking for an answer, and the options are A, B, C, D, I need to provide the best possible answer based on the information given.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with both B and D as correct. But if the options are single-choice, then there might be a mistake. However, since the user is asking for an answer here, and given that both B and D are correct based on standard electronegativity values, I should note that. But if the original question expects only one answer, perhaps there's an error in the options.\n\nBut since I have to provide an answer, and considering that the user might have a source where only one is correct, I'll check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the bond. For example, in option B: Br—N. If the bond is written as Br—N, then the more electronegative atom is N, so it's written second. So the negative end is N, written last. Correct.\n\nIn option D: P—Cl. Cl is more electronegative, written second. Correct.\n\nTherefore, both B and D are correct. But the options are given as single-choice. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the question's options. However, since I need to provide an answer, and given that both B and D are correct, but the user might expect one, I'll have to choose based on the most likely intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the answer is D. For example, if the question is from a chapter discussing main group elements, and P and Cl are in the same period, whereas Br and N are in different periods. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the answer is D because in the bond notation, the more electronegative atom is typically written second, and both B and D follow that, but the question is designed to have only one correct answer, so perhaps D is the intended one. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to state that both B and D are correct based on standard electronegativity values, but if the question expects one answer, it might be D. However, since the user might be expecting a single answer, I'll check once more.\n\nWait, let me check the electronegativity values again for Br and N. According to the IUPAC or standard chemistry sources:\n\n- Nitrogen: 3.04  \n- Bromine: 2.96  \n\nYes, so N is more electronegative. Therefore, Br—N bond has the negative end (N) written last. So B is correct.\n\nSimilarly, Cl (3.16) is more than P (2.19), so D is correct.\n\nThus, both B and D are correct. Therefore, if the options are multiple-choice and allow multiple answers, then B and D. If it's single-choice, there's a mistake in the question. However, since the user has presented the options as A, B, C, D, and the question is likely expecting one answer, I might have to consider that perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not sure why B wouldn't be correct.\n\nGiven that, I'll provide both B and D as correct answers, but note that there might be an issue with the question if only one is expected.\n</think>"}
