First, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, compound A is made of a metal and a non-metal in a weight ratio of 18:7. When excess water is added to 1 mole of A, it produces 2 moles of a gaseous substance Y and 3 moles of a base Z, which is sparingly soluble in water. Both Y and Z have basic properties. The relative density of gas Y compared to CO2 is 0.39. Also, one of the ions in compound A doesn't color the flame red. We need to find the molecular weight range of compound A from the given options.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the weight ratio of metal to non-metal is 18:7. Let me denote the metal as M and the non-metal as X. So, the formula of compound A could be something like M_xX_y. The weight ratio is 18:7, which means that if we take the atomic weights of M and X, their ratio in the compound is 18:7. But since the ratio is by weight, we need to consider the number of atoms as well. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nNext, when compound A reacts with water, it produces gas Y and base Z. Both are basic, which suggests that Y and Z could be something like ammonia (NH3) and a hydroxide base. But since the base Z is sparingly soluble, maybe it's a hydroxide of a metal that isn't very soluble, like magnesium hydroxide or something else. Wait, but if Z is a base and it's formed in 3 moles from 1 mole of A, perhaps Z is a hydroxide with a +2 or +3 charge? Let me think.\n\nAlso, the gas Y has a relative density to CO2 of 0.39. Relative density is the ratio of the molar masses. Since CO2 has a molar mass of 44 g/mol, the molar mass of Y would be 0.39 * 44. Let me calculate that: 0.39 * 44 = 17.16 g/mol. So the molar mass of gas Y is approximately 17 g/mol. Common gases with that molar mass... Well, ammonia (NH3) has a molar mass of 14 + 3 = 17 g/mol. So Y is likely ammonia. That makes sense because ammonia is a basic gas. So Y is NH3.\n\nThen, since the reaction produces 2 moles of NH3 and 3 moles of base Z from 1 mole of compound A. Let me think about possible reactions that produce ammonia and a base when reacting with water. For example, if compound A is a nitride of a metal, then adding water would hydrolyze the nitride to produce ammonia and the metal hydroxide. For instance, if we have a metal nitride like M3N2, then reacting with water would produce ammonia and the metal hydroxide.\n\nLet me write a general reaction. Suppose compound A is M3N2. Then the reaction with water would be:\n\nM3N2 + 6H2O → 2NH3 + 3M(OH)2\n\nBut wait, the stoichiometry here would be 1 mole of M3N2 producing 2 moles of NH3 and 3 moles of M(OH)2. That matches the given data: 1 mol A → 2 mol Y (NH3) and 3 mol Z (base). So if Z is the hydroxide of the metal, then Z is M(OH)n, and since it's formed in 3 moles from 1 mole of A, the formula of A would need to have 3 metal atoms per formula unit if the hydroxide is monovalent or something else. Let me think more carefully.\n\nLet me assume that the formula of compound A is M3N2. Then reacting with water:\n\nM3N2 + 6H2O → 2NH3 + 3M(OH)2\n\nThis would give 3 moles of M(OH)2. So if the base Z is M(OH)2, then the metal is in +2 oxidation state. But if the formula of A is different, maybe. Alternatively, if the nitride is M3N, then:\n\nM3N + 3H2O → NH3 + 3M(OH)\n\nBut in that case, only 1 mole of NH3 is produced, but the problem states 2 moles. So the nitride must be M3N2. That seems right. So compound A is a metal nitride with formula M3N2.\n\nNow, the next step is to figure out what metal M is. Also, the weight ratio of metal to non-metal in compound A is 18:7. The non-metal here is nitrogen. The atomic weight of nitrogen is 14 g/mol. Let's calculate the ratio.\n\nIn compound A (M3N2), the total mass of metal is 3*M, and the total mass of nitrogen is 2*14 = 28 g/mol. The weight ratio is 3M : 28 = 18:7. So:\n\n3M / 28 = 18 / 7\n\nSolving for M:\n\n3M = (18/7) * 28\n\nCalculate (18/7)*28: 18*4 = 72\n\nSo 3M = 72 → M = 24 g/mol.\n\nSo the atomic weight of the metal is 24 g/mol. Which metal has an atomic weight of 24? Magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.3 g/mol. So M is Mg. Therefore, compound A is Mg3N2.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. Mg3N2 is magnesium nitride. When it reacts with water, it should produce ammonia and magnesium hydroxide. Let me write the reaction:\n\nMg3N2 + 6H2O → 2NH3 + 3Mg(OH)2\n\nYes, that's correct. Magnesium hydroxide is a base and is sparingly soluble in water (it's one of the common insoluble bases), so Z is Mg(OH)2. The gas Y is NH3, which has a molar mass of 17 g/mol, and CO2 is 44 g/mol. The relative density is 17/44 ≈ 0.386, which is approximately 0.39 as given. So that checks out.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that one of the ions of compound A does not color the flame red. Flame tests: metals like sodium (Na) give a yellow flame, potassium (K) gives violet, calcium (Ca) gives orange-red, strontium (Sr) gives red, barium (Ba) gives green, etc. Magnesium (Mg) doesn't produce a colored flame; it usually gives a bright white or no color. So in Mg3N2, the ions are Mg²+ and N³⁻. Since Mg²+ doesn't color the flame, that matches the statement. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, the question asks for the molecular weight of compound A. Let's calculate it. Mg3N2 has 3 Mg atoms and 2 N atoms.\n\nMolar mass of Mg is ~24.3 g/mol, N is 14 g/mol.\n\nSo total molar mass = 3*24.3 + 2*14 = 72.9 + 28 = 100.9 g/mol.\n\nSo the molecular weight is approximately 100.9 g/mol. Looking at the options:\n\nA: 140-160\n\nB: 115-135\n\nC: 90-110\n\nD: 65-85\n\nSo 100.9 falls into option C (90-110). But wait, let me check if there are any possible errors in my reasoning.\n\nFirst, the calculation of the metal's atomic weight. The weight ratio is 18:7. I set up 3M / 28 = 18/7. Let me verify that.\n\nThe weight ratio of metal to non-metal is 18:7. So in the compound, the mass of metal is 18 parts, non-metal is 7 parts. Wait, but in the compound, the actual masses are 3M and 28 (for N2). Therefore, the ratio is 3M : 28 = 18 : 7. So:\n\n3M / 28 = 18 / 7 → 3M = (18/7)*28 = 18*4 = 72 → M = 24. Correct. So Mg is indeed the metal.\n\nTherefore, the molar mass of Mg3N2 is 3*24.3 + 2*14 = 72.9 + 28 = 100.9 g/mol. So approximately 101 g/mol. Therefore, the correct range is option C: 90 to 110. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA: 140-160\n\nB: 115-135\n\nC: 90-110\n\nD: 65-85\n\nYes, 101 is in option C. So the answer should be C. However, let me check if there's another possible compound that could fit the data. For example, is there another metal that could give a similar molar mass?\n\nSuppose the formula of the compound is different. Let's say it's not M3N2. Let me consider another possibility. For example, if the formula is M4N3, then the reaction would be:\n\nM4N3 + 6H2O → 3NH3 + 4M(OH)1.5? Wait, that doesn't make sense. The hydroxide formula should have whole numbers. Alternatively, maybe the formula is M2N3? Let me check.\n\nIf the formula is M2N3, then reacting with water:\n\nM2N3 + 6H2O → 2NH3 + 2M(OH)3\n\nBut this would produce 2 moles of NH3 and 2 moles of the hydroxide. But the problem states 2 moles of NH3 and 3 moles of base. So that's inconsistent. Therefore, the formula must be such that 1 mole of A produces 2 moles of NH3 and 3 moles of base. Which fits with M3N2 producing 2 NH3 and 3 Mg(OH)2.\n\nAnother possibility: if the base is something else. Suppose the base is not hydroxide but something else. But since it's formed by adding water to a metal compound, it's likely hydroxide. Also, given that both Y and Z have basic properties, NH3 is a base and hydroxides are bases. So that makes sense.\n\nIs there another gas with a molar mass of ~17 g/mol? Let's see: NH3 is 17, CH4 is 16, but CH4 is not basic. So Y must be NH3. Therefore, the compound A must be a nitride. So the only plausible compound is Mg3N2 with molar mass ~101, so option C.\n\nBut wait, let me check the exact molar mass. Mg is 24.305 g/mol, N is 14.007 g/mol.\n\nCalculating Mg3N2:\n\n3 * 24.305 = 72.915 g/mol\n\n2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol\n\nTotal = 72.915 + 28.014 = 100.929 g/mol ≈ 100.9 g/mol. So yes, in the range of 90-110. Therefore, option C.\n\nAnother check: the problem mentions that one of the ions does not color the flame red. The ions in Mg3N2 are Mg²+ and N³⁻. The nitride ion is not a metal ion, so the flame test is for the metal ion. Mg²+ does not color the flame red; in fact, it doesn't produce a strong color. So that's consistent. If the metal were, say, Sr²+ (which does color the flame red), then this would contradict the problem statement. But since Mg doesn't, it's okay.\n\nTherefore, all the clues point to compound A being Mg3N2 with a molecular weight of ~101, so the correct answer is option C.\n</think>"}
