The problem states that there's a circle passing through the foci F₁ and F₂ of the ellipse and tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of ellipses and circles.\n\nFirst, the standard form of an ellipse is (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1. Comparing that to the given equation kx² + y² = 1, I can rewrite it as (x²/(1/k)) + (y²/1) = 1. So, that means that the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis depend on the value of k. Since k > 1, 1/k < 1, which means that the major axis is along the y-axis because the denominator under y² is larger. Wait, no. Wait, if k > 1, then 1/k < 1, so the denominator under x² is smaller than the denominator under y². Therefore, the major axis is along the y-axis. So, the standard form would be (x²/b²) + (y²/a²) = 1 with a > b. In this case, a² = 1 and b² = 1/k. Therefore, a = 1 and b = 1/√k. \n\nNow, the distance of the foci from the center for an ellipse is given by c, where c² = a² - b². Since the major axis is along the y-axis, the foci are located at (0, ±c). Let me compute c:\n\nc² = a² - b² = 1 - (1/k). Therefore, c = √(1 - 1/k). Therefore, the coordinates of F₁ and F₂ are (0, √(1 - 1/k)) and (0, -√(1 - 1/k)) respectively.\n\nNow, there is a circle passing through these two foci and tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. Let me try to visualize this. The ellipse intersects the x-axis at points where y = 0. Plugging into the ellipse equation: kx² = 1 ⇒ x² = 1/k ⇒ x = ±1/√k. So, the ellipse intersects the x-axis at (±1/√k, 0). The circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis, which must be these points? Or maybe some other points? Wait, but if the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis, then those points must lie on both the ellipse and the circle, and the tangents at those points must be the same. However, the ellipse intersects the x-axis at (±1/√k, 0). If the circle is tangent to the ellipse at those points, then the circle must pass through (±1/√k, 0) and also through F₁ and F₂. Alternatively, maybe the points of tangency are different? But the problem says \"lies tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis,\" so those points are on the x-axis and on both the ellipse and the circle. Therefore, the circle passes through (±a, 0) where a is something? Wait, but the ellipse's x-intercepts are at ±1/√k. If the circle is tangent at those points, then the circle must pass through those points. Also, since the circle passes through F₁ and F₂, which are on the y-axis. So the circle passes through (0, c) and (0, -c) and is tangent to the ellipse at (±d, 0) for some d. Wait, but if the tangency points are on the x-axis, they must be points where both the ellipse and circle meet, and their tangents coincide. \n\nBut maybe the points of tangency are the same as the x-intercepts? Let me check. If the circle is tangent to the ellipse at the x-intercepts, then those points are (±1/√k, 0). Let me assume that. Then, the circle passes through (1/√k, 0), (-1/√k, 0), (0, c), and (0, -c). However, a circle is uniquely determined by three non-collinear points. So if the circle passes through these four points, then those four points must lie on the same circle. Let me check if that's possible. Let me try to find the equation of the circle passing through (1/√k, 0), (-1/√k, 0), (0, c), (0, -c). \n\nThe general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Let me plug in the points.\n\nFirst, plugging in (1/√k, 0):\n\n(1/k) + 0 + D*(1/√k) + E*0 + F = 0 ⇒ 1/k + D/√k + F = 0. Similarly, plugging in (-1/√k, 0):\n\n(1/k) + 0 + D*(-1/√k) + E*0 + F = 0 ⇒ 1/k - D/√k + F = 0.\n\nSubtracting these two equations: [1/k + D/√k + F] - [1/k - D/√k + F] = 0 ⇒ 2D/√k = 0 ⇒ D = 0. Therefore, D = 0. Then, substituting back into one of the equations, say the first one: 1/k + 0 + F = 0 ⇒ F = -1/k.\n\nNow, let's plug in the point (0, c):\n\n0 + c² + 0 + E*c + F = 0 ⇒ c² + E*c + F = 0. Similarly, plugging in (0, -c):\n\n0 + c² + 0 + E*(-c) + F = 0 ⇒ c² - E*c + F = 0.\n\nAdding these two equations: 2c² + 2F = 0 ⇒ c² + F = 0. Therefore, F = -c². But earlier, we found that F = -1/k. Therefore, -c² = -1/k ⇒ c² = 1/k. However, from earlier, we have c² = 1 - 1/k. Therefore, setting equal:\n\n1 - 1/k = 1/k ⇒ 1 = 2/k ⇒ k = 2. \n\nWait, so that suggests that k = 2? Let me check if this is consistent. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nStarting with the ellipse equation kx² + y² = 1. For k > 1, major axis along y-axis. Then, a² = 1, b² = 1/k. Then c² = a² - b² = 1 - 1/k. Then, the foci are at (0, ±c). Then, assuming the circle passes through the foci and the points of tangency on the x-axis, which are (±1/√k, 0). Then, solving for the circle equation, we found D = 0, F = -1/k. Then, using the points (0, c) and (0, -c), we found that c² + F = 0 ⇒ c² = -F = 1/k. But c² was also equal to 1 - 1/k, so 1 - 1/k = 1/k ⇒ 1 = 2/k ⇒ k = 2. \n\nSo according to this, k = 2. However, the problem says that the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. However, in this calculation, we just forced the circle to pass through those points and the foci. But does that ensure tangency? Because just passing through those points doesn't necessarily mean that the circle is tangent to the ellipse there. So perhaps there is an error here. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check if the circle is actually tangent to the ellipse at those points. Let me check for k = 2. Let me take k = 2, so the ellipse is 2x² + y² = 1. The foci are located at (0, ±c), where c² = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 ⇒ c = 1/√2. Therefore, foci at (0, ±1/√2). The circle passing through (±1/√k, 0) = (±1/√2, 0) and (0, ±1/√2). Let me find the equation of this circle. \n\nWe already found that with k = 2, F = -1/k = -1/2, D = 0. Then from the equation c² + E*c + F = 0. Let's compute E. For k = 2, c² = 1/2. Therefore, plugging into c² + E*c + F = 0:\n\n1/2 + E*(1/√2) - 1/2 = 0 ⇒ E*(1/√2) = 0 ⇒ E = 0. Therefore, the equation of the circle is x² + y² + 0x + 0y - 1/2 = 0 ⇒ x² + y² = 1/2. \n\nSo the circle is x² + y² = 1/2. Let me check if this circle is tangent to the ellipse 2x² + y² = 1 at (±1/√2, 0). Let me check the derivatives at that point to see if they are tangent. \n\nFirst, for the ellipse 2x² + y² = 1. Taking derivative implicitly:\n\n4x + 2y y' = 0 ⇒ y' = - (4x)/(2y) = -2x/y. At the point (1/√2, 0), the derivative would be undefined (since y = 0), meaning the tangent line is vertical. Similarly, for the circle x² + y² = 1/2. Taking derivative:\n\n2x + 2y y' = 0 ⇒ y' = -x/y. At (1/√2, 0), similarly, the derivative is undefined, so tangent line is vertical. Therefore, both the ellipse and the circle have vertical tangent lines at (±1/√2, 0). Therefore, they are tangent there. So that seems to check out. Therefore, k = 2 is indeed the correct answer? \n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"there is a circle which passes through F₁ and F₂ and which lies tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis.\" So according to this, yes, for k = 2, the circle x² + y² = 1/2 passes through the foci (0, ±1/√2) and is tangent to the ellipse at (±1/√2, 0). Therefore, seems correct. \n\nBut let me check if there could be another circle. Suppose that the points of tangency are not the x-intercepts of the ellipse. But the problem says the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. The ellipse only intersects the x-axis at (±1/√k, 0), so those must be the points of tangency. Therefore, the circle must pass through those points and be tangent there. Therefore, the previous reasoning is correct, leading to k = 2. \n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm. Let me parametrize the circle passing through F₁ and F₂. Since F₁ and F₂ are (0, c) and (0, -c), the circle passing through them must be symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Therefore, its center must lie on the x-axis. Wait, because if a circle is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and passes through (0, c) and (0, -c), then the center must lie on the x-axis. Let me confirm this. \n\nSuppose the circle has center (h, 0) because of symmetry. Then, the distance from (h, 0) to (0, c) must be equal to the radius. Therefore, radius squared is h² + c². Also, since the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis, say at (d, 0) and (-d, 0). The distance from the center (h, 0) to (d, 0) must be equal to the radius. Therefore, |h - d| = sqrt(h² + c²). Squaring both sides: (h - d)² = h² + c² ⇒ h² - 2hd + d² = h² + c² ⇒ -2hd + d² = c² ⇒ d² - 2 h d - c² = 0. \n\nAdditionally, since (d, 0) lies on the ellipse, plugging into ellipse equation: k d² + 0 = 1 ⇒ d² = 1/k. Therefore, substituting into the previous equation:\n\n(1/k) - 2 h d - c² = 0. \n\nBut we also know from earlier that c² = 1 - 1/k. Therefore, substituting that in:\n\n1/k - 2 h d - (1 - 1/k) = 0 ⇒ 1/k - 2 h d - 1 + 1/k = 0 ⇒ 2/k - 1 - 2 h d = 0 ⇒ -2 h d = 1 - 2/k ⇒ h d = (2/k - 1)/2 = (2 - k)/2k.\n\nBut we need another equation to relate h and d. Also, since the circle is tangent to the ellipse at (d, 0), the tangent lines must coincide. Let me compute the derivatives again. For the ellipse at (d, 0), as before, the tangent is vertical. For the circle, which has center (h, 0) and passes through (d, 0), the tangent at (d, 0): since the radius is horizontal (from (h, 0) to (d, 0)), the tangent line is vertical. Therefore, both curves have vertical tangent lines at that point, so they are tangent. Therefore, the condition is automatically satisfied as long as the circle passes through (d, 0) and has center on the x-axis. Therefore, the previous equations are sufficient. \n\nTherefore, we have h d = (2 - k)/2k. Also, we have d² = 1/k. Also, the radius of the circle is sqrt(h² + c²). Also, the radius is |h - d|. Therefore, equating:\n\nsqrt(h² + c²) = |h - d|. Squaring both sides:\n\nh² + c² = (h - d)^2 = h² - 2 h d + d² ⇒ c² = -2 h d + d². Which is the same equation as before. Which gave us h d = (2/k - 1)/2. \n\nBut we need another relation. Wait, but we already used all the conditions. However, we have two variables here: h and d, but d is related to k via d² = 1/k, and h is related to k via h d = (2 - k)/2k. However, h is also related to the circle passing through (d, 0) and (0, c). Wait, but we already used that to get the equation. Therefore, perhaps we need another condition? Wait, but we have only one equation here with h and k. But since d is expressed in terms of k, maybe we can write h in terms of k?\n\nFrom h d = (2 - k)/2k, and d = ±1/√k. But since the center is at (h, 0), and the circle passes through (d, 0), which is on the x-axis. Depending on whether d is to the right or left of the center, h could be positive or negative. However, since the ellipse is symmetric, let's assume d is positive, so d = 1/√k. Then, h*(1/√k) = (2 - k)/2k ⇒ h = [(2 - k)/2k] * √k = (2 - k)/(2√k). \n\nNow, we also know that the radius squared is h² + c². Also, radius squared is (h - d)^2. Let me check if these are consistent. \n\nCompute h² + c²:\n\n[(2 - k)^2 / (4k)] + [1 - 1/k] \n\n= [(4 - 4k + k²)/4k] + [ (k - 1)/k ]\n\n= (4 - 4k + k²)/4k + 4(k - 1)/4k \n\n= [4 - 4k + k² + 4k - 4]/4k \n\n= [k²]/4k \n\n= k/4.\n\nOn the other hand, (h - d)^2:\n\n[ (2 - k)/(2√k) - 1/√k ]² \n\n= [ (2 - k - 2)/2√k ]² \n\n= [ (-k)/2√k ]² \n\n= [ -√k / 2 ]² \n\n= k / 4.\n\nTherefore, both expressions for radius squared are equal to k/4. Therefore, the equations are consistent for any k? Wait, but we had earlier derived that c² = 1 - 1/k, and in this calculation, we have h² + c² = k/4. Let me check with k = 2. For k = 2, h = (2 - 2)/(2√2) = 0. Therefore, center at (0, 0), radius squared is 0 + c² = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, which is equal to k/4 = 2/4 = 1/2. Correct. \n\nBut how do we determine k? It seems like in this approach, we have consistency for any k? But we need another condition. Wait, but we already used all the given conditions: circle passes through foci and tangent points. However, in our previous approach, we found k = 2 by requiring that the circle passes through both the foci and the points on the x-axis. However, in this second approach, we have expressions in terms of k but no additional constraints. \n\nWait, but in the first approach, we found k = 2 by using the fact that the circle passes through those four points. However, in reality, a circle passing through three non-colinear points is unique. In the first approach, we found that if we assume the circle passes through the two foci and the two x-intercepts, then we must have k = 2. However, in this second approach, we are parametrizing the circle passing through foci and tangent at x-axis points. But in this case, we have infinitely many circles passing through the foci and some points on the x-axis, but only for specific k would the circle be tangent. However, in our calculation, we didn't get a specific k. Wait, but in reality, the tangency condition is already satisfied because of the way we constructed the circle? \n\nWait, no. Wait, in this second approach, we constructed a circle passing through the foci and through (d, 0) and (-d, 0). However, (d, 0) is on the ellipse. However, unless the circle is tangent there, it could intersect the ellipse at more points. However, we forced the circle to pass through (d, 0) and have the same tangent line there (vertical), so that should make it tangent. Therefore, the circle is uniquely determined by passing through the two foci and tangent at (d, 0). However, in our equations, we didn't get a specific value for k. But in reality, we did get an expression for h and radius in terms of k, but how do we find k?\n\nWait, but perhaps there is another condition. The circle is tangent to the ellipse only at those two points on the x-axis. Therefore, there should be no other intersection points between the circle and the ellipse. However, how do we ensure that? Maybe there is another intersection point unless some condition is satisfied. Alternatively, maybe we need to ensure that the system of equations of the ellipse and the circle has exactly two solutions (the points on the x-axis). \n\nLet me try solving the equations of the ellipse and the circle. The ellipse is kx² + y² = 1. The circle is x² + y² = k/4 (since radius squared is k/4 as we found earlier). Wait, in the second approach, we found that radius squared is k/4. Therefore, the circle equation is x² + y² = k/4. \n\nTherefore, substituting y² from the circle into the ellipse equation:\n\nkx² + (k/4 - x²) = 1 ⇒ kx² + k/4 - x² = 1 ⇒ (k - 1)x² + k/4 - 1 = 0.\n\nTherefore, (k - 1)x² = 1 - k/4 ⇒ x² = [1 - k/4]/(k - 1) = [ (4 - k)/4 ] / (k - 1) ) = -(4 - k)/[4(k - 1)] = (k - 4)/[4(k - 1)].\n\nTherefore, the x-coordinates of intersections between the ellipse and the circle satisfy x² = (k - 4)/[4(k - 1)]. \n\nBut we want the circle to intersect the ellipse only at the two points on the x-axis, which are x = ±d = ±1/√k. Therefore, the above equation must have solutions only at x = ±1/√k. Therefore, the equation x² = (k - 4)/[4(k - 1)] must be equal to (1/√k)² = 1/k. Therefore, equate:\n\n(k - 4)/[4(k - 1)] = 1/k ⇒ Cross multiplying:\n\nk(k - 4) = 4(k - 1) ⇒ k² - 4k = 4k - 4 ⇒ k² - 8k + 4 = 0.\n\nSolving this quadratic equation: k = [8 ± √(64 - 16)]/2 = [8 ± √48]/2 = [8 ± 4√3]/2 = 4 ± 2√3.\n\nBut since k > 1, both solutions are positive (since √3 ≈ 1.732, so 4 - 2√3 ≈ 4 - 3.464 = 0.536, which is less than 1, so invalid. Therefore, only k = 4 + 2√3 ≈ 4 + 3.464 = 7.464 is valid. Wait, but this contradicts the previous result of k = 2. What's going on here?\n\nThis suggests that there is inconsistency between the two approaches. In the first approach, assuming that the circle passes through the x-intercepts and the foci leads to k = 2. In the second approach, by parametrizing the circle passing through the foci and tangent at x-axis points, and then ensuring that the system of equations only has solutions at those points, we get k = 4 + 2√3. \n\nThis inconsistency must be resolved. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me check the second approach again. The circle equation was derived as x² + y² = k/4. Then, substituting into the ellipse equation gives (k - 1)x² + k/4 - 1 = 0. For the intersections to be only at x = ±1/√k, the equation (k - 1)x² + (k/4 - 1) = 0 must have only x = ±1/√k as solutions. However, if we already know that x = ±1/√k are solutions, then substituting x² = 1/k into the equation:\n\n(k - 1)(1/k) + k/4 - 1 = 0 ⇒ (1 - 1/k) + k/4 - 1 = -1/k + k/4 = 0 ⇒ k/4 = 1/k ⇒ k² = 4 ⇒ k = ±2. Since k > 1, k = 2. Therefore, this suggests that k = 2 is the solution. But earlier, when I equated [ (k - 4)/[4(k - 1)] ] = 1/k, I got a different answer. Wait, why?\n\nBecause in the second approach, I assumed that the equation (k - 1)x² + k/4 - 1 = 0 must have solutions only at x² = 1/k. However, if x² = 1/k is a solution, then substituting gives k/4 - 1 + (k - 1)/k = 0 ⇒ ... which gives k = 2. However, when I set the expression for x² equal to 1/k, I must have made an error. Let me redo that step.\n\nFrom the equation (k - 1)x² + k/4 - 1 = 0 ⇒ x² = [1 - k/4]/(k - 1). For this equation to have only x² = 1/k as solutions, the expression [1 - k/4]/(k - 1) must equal 1/k. Therefore:\n\n[1 - (k/4)] / (k - 1) = 1/k ⇒ Multiply both sides by k(k - 1):\n\nk[1 - k/4] = (k - 1)\n\nExpand left side: k - k²/4 = k - 1 ⇒ Subtract k from both sides: -k²/4 = -1 ⇒ k²/4 = 1 ⇒ k² = 4 ⇒ k = 2. Since k > 1. Therefore, k = 2. \n\nAh! So earlier, when I was solving, I incorrectly expanded or did algebra. Therefore, the correct solution is k = 2, which matches the first approach. Therefore, my previous step where I thought I had a quadratic equation was incorrect due to miscalculations. Therefore, k = 2 is indeed the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, both approaches confirm that k = 2. Therefore, the answer is 2. \n\nBut let me just check once more. If k = 2, then the circle equation is x² + y² = 2/4 = 1/2. The ellipse equation is 2x² + y² = 1. Solving them together:\n\nFrom circle: y² = 1/2 - x². Substitute into ellipse: 2x² + (1/2 - x²) = 1 ⇒ x² + 1/2 = 1 ⇒ x² = 1/2 ⇒ x = ±1/√2. Therefore, the only intersections are at x = ±1/√2, y = 0. Therefore, exactly two points on the x-axis. Therefore, the circle is tangent there. Perfect. Therefore, k = 2 is correct. \n\nTherefore, despite the confusion in the second approach where I thought I had a quadratic, the correct value is k = 2. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2}\n</think>"}
