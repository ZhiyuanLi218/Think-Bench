The options are PCl4F, BF3, CO2, and CBr4. I remember that molecular geometry depends on the number of bonding pairs and lone pairs around the central atom. So I need to determine the geometry of each molecule.\n\nStarting with PCl4F. Phosphorus is the central atom here. Phosphorus typically has five valence electrons. It's bonded to four chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom. So that's five bonding regions. Wait, but if there are five bonding pairs, the electron geometry would be trigonal bipyramidal, right? But the question is about molecular shape. If all five are bonding, then the shape would be trigonal bipyramidal. But maybe there's a lone pair? Let me think. Phosphorus can expand its octet. In PCl5, it's trigonal bipyramidal. So PCl4F would have five bonding pairs and no lone pairs? So the molecular geometry would still be trigonal bipyramidal. So maybe PCl4F is trigonal bipyramidal, not tetrahedral. So A is probably not the answer.\n\nNext, BF3. Boron has three valence electrons. It's bonded to three fluorine atoms. So three bonding pairs, no lone pairs. The geometry would be trigonal planar. So B is trigonal planar, not tetrahedral. So B is out.\n\nCO2. Carbon is the central atom. It's bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon has four valence electrons. In CO2, the structure is O=C=O. The carbon has two double bonds. But in terms of electron pairs, there are two bonding regions. So the electron geometry is linear. The molecular shape is also linear. So C is linear, not tetrahedral. So C is out.\n\nNow D: CBr4. Carbon is the central atom. Carbon has four valence electrons. It's bonded to four bromine atoms. Each bond is a single bond. So four bonding pairs, no lone pairs. The electron geometry and molecular geometry would both be tetrahedral. So D has a tetrahedral shape. That should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For example, in methane (CH4), the shape is tetrahedral. Similarly, CBr4 would have the same structure, just with bromine instead of hydrogen. So yes, four bonding pairs, no lone pairs, so tetrahedral. So D is the answer. The others don't fit. PCl4F is trigonal bipyramidal, BF3 is trigonal planar, CO2 is linear. So the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
