The options are 8, 10, 12, or 14. Let me start by recalling what I know about structural isomers and how to count them.\n\nFirst, the molecular formula is C4H8BrCl. Let me check the degree of unsaturation to see if there are any rings or double bonds. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=4, H=8, X=2 (since there are two halogens, Br and Cl), and N=0. So plugging in: (2*4 + 2 - 8 - 2)/2 = (10 - 10)/2 = 0. So degree of unsaturation is 0, meaning no rings or double bonds. Therefore, all structures must be acyclic and saturated (all single bonds).\n\nNow, the task is to find all structural isomers (constitutional isomers) of C4H8BrCl. Structural isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms. Since we have two different halogens, Br and Cl, their positions on the carbon chain can vary, leading to different isomers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider all possible carbon skeletons for C4H8BrCl. Since it's a four-carbon molecule with two halogens, the structure will be a four-carbon chain with Br and Cl attached to different carbons. However, the carbon chain can be straight or branched. Let me think about the possible carbon skeletons.\n\nFor four carbons, the possible straight chains are butane (unbranched). But since we are dealing with different positions for Br and Cl, maybe branching can also occur. Wait, but since the formula is C4H8BrCl, the total number of hydrogens is 8. Let me verify if that's correct for a saturated molecule with two substituents.\n\nA saturated four-carbon molecule with no substituents would be C4H10. Each halogen substitution replaces a hydrogen. Since we have two halogens, Br and Cl, replacing two hydrogens, the formula becomes C4H8BrCl. That makes sense. So the structure is similar to a four-carbon chain with Br and Cl attached to different positions.\n\nNow, to find all possible structural isomers, I need to consider all possible ways to attach Br and Cl to the carbon chain, considering different positions and different carbon skeletons.\n\nFirst, let me consider all possible carbon skeletons. For four carbons, the possible carbon skeletons are:\n\n1. Straight chain: 1, 2, 3, 4 (butane)\n2. Branched: 2-methylpropane (isobutane). Wait, but with four carbons, the only branched structure is 2-methylpropane, which is actually isobutane. However, when considering different positions for Br and Cl, we need to see if branching affects the possible positions.\n\nBut since the molecule is saturated and has four carbons, the possible carbon skeletons are:\n\n- Unbranched: four carbons in a straight line (carbon positions 1, 2, 3, 4)\n- Branched: three carbons in a chain with a methyl branch on the middle carbon (carbon positions 1, 2, 3 with a methyl on carbon 2)\n\nSo two different carbon skeletons.\n\nNow, for each skeleton, I need to determine the possible positions for Br and Cl.\n\nLet me start with the straight chain skeleton (butane):\n\nPositions are C1, C2, C3, C4. Since it's a straight chain, C1 and C4 are equivalent, and C2 and C3 are equivalent. Wait, no. In a straight chain, C1 and C4 are terminal carbons, so they are equivalent. C2 and C3 are adjacent to different numbers of other carbons. Wait, actually, in a straight chain of four carbons, C1 and C4 are both primary (1°), C2 and C3 are secondary (2°). So for substituents, positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, 2 and 3 are equivalent. But since we have two different substituents (Br and Cl), the order matters. Let me think.\n\nFor the straight chain, the possible positions for Br and Cl can be:\n\nCase 1: Both substituents on the same carbon. But wait, each carbon can have multiple substituents? However, the formula is C4H8BrCl. Let me check the valency. Each carbon must have four bonds. If a carbon has both Br and Cl attached, that's two substituents, so the remaining bonds would be H and the adjacent C atoms. For example, if a carbon has Br and Cl attached, then it would have two H's if it's a terminal carbon (since it's connected to one C), or one H if it's a middle carbon (connected to two C's). Wait, but the formula is C4H8BrCl. Let me verify.\n\nIf both Br and Cl are on the same carbon, then that carbon would have Br, Cl, and the appropriate number of H's. Let's take an example. Suppose both Br and Cl are on C1. The structure would be Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cl? No, wait, if both Br and Cl are on the same carbon, then for example, Br and Cl on C1 would be BrClCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the molecular formula is C4H8BrCl. Let me calculate the number of hydrogens. For a saturated molecule with four carbons and two substituents (each substituent replaces a hydrogen). The formula for a saturated molecule with four carbons is C4H10. Each halogen replaces a hydrogen, so two halogens would make it C4H8BrCl. Therefore, each carbon can have at most one halogen, or two halogens on the same carbon? Wait, if two halogens are on the same carbon, that would replace two hydrogens. But the formula is already accounting for two halogens. So yes, it's possible to have both Br and Cl on the same carbon. For example, if a carbon has both Br and Cl attached, then two hydrogens are replaced by Br and Cl. So that is allowed.\n\nTherefore, possible isomers include cases where Br and Cl are on the same carbon or different carbons. So I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nSo for the straight chain:\n\nFirst, consider substituents on the same carbon:\n\nPossible positions for both Br and Cl on the same carbon:\n\n- C1: Br and Cl on C1\n- C2: Br and Cl on C2\n- C3: Br and Cl on C3 (equivalent to C2)\n- C4: Br and Cl on C4 (equivalent to C1)\n\nSo unique positions here are C1 and C2. So two isomers here.\n\nNext, substituents on different carbons. Now, since Br and Cl are different, the order matters. For example, Br on C1 and Cl on C2 is different from Br on C2 and Cl on C1? Wait, no, because if the positions are different. Wait, but in a straight chain, if Br is on C1 and Cl on C2, versus Br on C2 and Cl on C1. Are these different isomers?\n\nYes, because the positions are different. However, we need to check for symmetry. Let me think. For example, if Br is on C1 and Cl on C2, and Br is on C3 and Cl on C2. Wait, since C1 and C4 are equivalent, and C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all possible combinations and eliminate duplicates due to symmetry.\n\nSo for different positions, Br and Cl on different carbons. Let me consider all possible pairs:\n\nPossible pairs (positions for Br and Cl):\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). But since we already considered same carbon positions (which are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)), but actually in the previous step we considered same carbon as (C1, C1) etc. Wait, actually, when considering different positions, we need to consider all combinations where Br and Cl are on different carbons. So the pairs would be (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4). However, some of these may be equivalent due to symmetry.\n\nLet me analyze each:\n\n(1,2): Br on C1 and Cl on C2. Since the chain is straight, if we reverse the chain, C1 becomes C4, and C2 becomes C3. So Br on C4 and Cl on C3 would be equivalent to Br on C1 and Cl on C2? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule would be Br-CH2-CHCl-CH2-CH3. If we reverse it, it would be CH3-CH2-CHCl-CH2-Br, which is the same as the original. Wait, no, because the positions are symmetric. Wait, if you have Br on C1 and Cl on C2, flipping the molecule would put Br on C4 and Cl on C3. However, since the molecule is straight, these are different positions unless there's a plane of symmetry.\n\nBut in a straight chain of four carbons, there is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. Wait, actually, the molecule is symmetric if you swap C1 with C4 and C2 with C3. Therefore, Br on C1 and Cl on C2 is equivalent to Br on C4 and Cl on C3. But since Br and Cl are different, swapping them would result in a different isomer. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have Br on C1 and Cl on C2. If we reverse the molecule (mirror image), it becomes Cl on C1 and Br on C4. But since Br and Cl are different, this is a different isomer. However, since we are considering structural isomers, the positions matter. So Br on C1 and Cl on C2 is different from Cl on C1 and Br on C4? Wait, but since the molecule is straight, C1 and C4 are equivalent positions. Therefore, if you have Br on C1 and Cl on C2, it's different from Br on C4 and Cl on C3 (which would be equivalent to Cl on C1 and Br on C2). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations where Br and Cl are on different carbons:\n\n1. Br on C1 and Cl on C2\n2. Br on C1 and Cl on C3\n3. Br on C1 and Cl on C4\n4. Br on C2 and Cl on C3\n5. Br on C2 and Cl on C4\n6. Br on C3 and Cl on C4\n\nNow, check for duplicates due to symmetry.\n\nFor case 1: Br on C1 and Cl on C2. If we reverse the molecule, this becomes Br on C4 and Cl on C3. But since Br and Cl are different, this is a different isomer. However, if we consider that the molecule is symmetric, perhaps there's an equivalent isomer. Wait, but if Br is on C1 and Cl on C2, and another isomer where Br is on C2 and Cl on C1, are they different?\n\nYes, because the positions are different. For example, Br on C1 and Cl on C2 is different from Br on C2 and Cl on C1. However, in the list above, case 1 is Br on C1 and Cl on C2, and there is no case where Br is on C2 and Cl on C1. Wait, that would be case 4: Br on C2 and Cl on C3. Wait, no. Wait, if Br is on C2 and Cl on C1, that would be equivalent to Br on C2 and Cl on C1. But in our list, we have Br on C1 and Cl on C2 (case 1) and Br on C2 and Cl on C3 (case 4). Wait, maybe I need to consider all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when considering different positions, some combinations are equivalent. For example, Br on C1 and Cl on C2 is not equivalent to Br on C2 and Cl on C1 because the positions are different. Therefore, these are two distinct isomers. However, in my initial list, I only have one of them. Wait, no. Wait, in my list above, the combinations are ordered such that Br is on a lower number carbon than Cl. But actually, since Br and Cl are different, the order matters. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider all permutations. However, that would lead to duplicates. Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nLet me think again. For two different substituents on different carbons, the number of isomers is equal to the number of ways to choose two different positions multiplied by the number of permutations of the substituents. Wait, no. Because if positions are different, then for each pair of positions, there are two possibilities: Br on position A and Cl on position B, or Br on position B and Cl on position A. However, if positions A and B are symmetric, then these two possibilities might be equivalent.\n\nBut in a straight chain, positions 1 and 4 are symmetric, as are 2 and 3.\n\nSo let's go back to the straight chain. Let me consider all possible pairs of positions for Br and Cl:\n\nPositions (1,2): Br on 1, Cl on 2; and Br on 2, Cl on 1. Are these different?\n\nYes, because the substituents are different. So these are two different isomers.\n\nPositions (1,3): Br on 1, Cl on 3; and Br on 3, Cl on 1. But since position 3 is symmetric to position 2 (wait, no: in a four-carbon chain, position 3 is symmetric to position 2? Wait, positions 1-2-3-4. The middle is between 2 and 3. So positions 1 and 4 are symmetric, 2 and 3 are symmetric. Therefore, position 3 is symmetric to position 2. Therefore, Br on 3 and Cl on 1 would be equivalent to Br on 2 and Cl on 4? Wait, no. Let me think. If you have Br on position 3 and Cl on 1, flipping the molecule would put Br on position 2 (since position 3 is symmetric to 2) and Cl on position 4 (since position 1 is symmetric to 4). Therefore, Br on 3 and Cl on 1 is equivalent to Br on 2 and Cl on 4. But Br on 2 and Cl on 4 is different from Br on 4 and Cl on 2? Wait, no, because position 4 is symmetric to 1. So Br on 2 and Cl on 4 is equivalent to Br on 2 and Cl on 1 (since 4 is symmetric to 1). Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to draw them mentally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the method of considering all unique combinations where the positions are not symmetrically equivalent.\n\nLet me try again. For the straight chain:\n\nPossible unique positions for two different substituents:\n\nCase A: Both substituents on terminal carbons (positions 1 and 4). But since they are symmetric, putting Br on 1 and Cl on 4 is the same as Br on 4 and Cl on 1. So only one isomer here.\n\nWait, but Br and Cl are different. If you have Br on 1 and Cl on 4, flipping the molecule would give Cl on 1 and Br on 4. Since Br and Cl are different, this is a different isomer. However, in structural isomerism, if you can't rotate or something to make them the same, they are different. But in this case, flipping the molecule (which is a symmetry operation) would make them equivalent? No, because Br and Cl are different. For example, if you have Br on C1 and Cl on C4, it's not the same as Cl on C1 and Br on C4 unless you can swap them, but since they are different atoms, they are different isomers. Therefore, this is two different isomers. Wait, but in reality, since the molecule is straight and symmetrical, these two would be considered different isomers. Therefore, for positions 1 and 4, there are two isomers: Br on 1 and Cl on 4, and Br on 4 and Cl on 1. But since positions 1 and 4 are symmetric, but the substituents are different, they are different isomers. Therefore, we have two isomers here.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcounting. Let me check. For example, if you have Br on C1 and Cl on C4, is that a different isomer than Br on C4 and Cl on C1? No, because the molecule can be rotated or viewed from the other end. Wait, but in structural isomerism, the connectivity is different. Wait, no, in structural isomerism, connectivity is the same but arrangement is different. Wait, no. Structural isomers have different connectivity. Wait, if Br is on C1 and Cl on C4, versus Br on C4 and Cl on C1, the connectivity is the same. Because the molecule is a straight chain with Br on one end and Cl on the other. Depending on which end you start counting, it's the same molecule. Therefore, these are not different structural isomers. They are the same compound. Therefore, only one isomer for positions 1 and 4.\n\nAh, okay, that's an important point. Structural isomers differ in the actual connectivity. If you can get from one to the other by just rotating or flipping the molecule, they are the same. Therefore, Br on C1 and Cl on C4 is the same as Br on C4 and Cl on C1 because you can just flip the molecule. Therefore, only one isomer for positions 1 and 4.\n\nSimilarly, positions 2 and 3: Br on C2 and Cl on C3 is the same as Br on C3 and Cl on C2 because flipping the molecule would swap C2 and C3. Therefore, only one isomer for positions 2 and 3.\n\nNow, positions 1 and 2: Br on C1 and Cl on C2. If you flip the molecule, it becomes Cl on C1 and Br on C4. But since Br and Cl are different, this is a different isomer. However, can we consider Br on C1 and Cl on C2 versus Br on C2 and Cl on C1? Wait, flipping the molecule would turn Br on C1 and Cl on C2 into Br on C4 and Cl on C3. But since positions 1 and 4 are symmetric, and 2 and 3 are symmetric, Br on C4 and Cl on C3 is equivalent to Br on C1 and Cl on C2? Wait, no, because Br is on a terminal and Cl is on a secondary carbon. Whereas Br on C2 and Cl on C1 would be Br on a secondary and Cl on a terminal. Therefore, these are different isomers. Therefore, Br on C1 and Cl on C2 is different from Br on C2 and Cl on C1. Therefore, these are two different isomers.\n\nSimilarly, positions 1 and 3: Br on C1 and Cl on C3. Flipping gives Cl on C1 and Br on C4. But since C3 is symmetric to C2 (wait, no: in a four-carbon chain, C3 is symmetric to C2? Let me visualize:\n\nCarbon positions: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4.\n\nThe middle is between 2 and 3. So position 2 and 3 are symmetric. Therefore, position 3 is symmetric to position 2. Therefore, Br on C3 is equivalent to Br on C2. Therefore, Br on C1 and Cl on C3 is equivalent to Br on C1 and Cl on C2? No, because Cl is on different positions. Wait, if you have Br on C1 and Cl on C3, flipping the molecule would put Br on C4 and Cl on C2. Since C2 is symmetric to C3, but the Br is on a different position. Therefore, Br on C4 and Cl on C2 is a different isomer from Br on C1 and Cl on C3? Or is it the same?\n\nWait, Br on C4 (which is symmetric to C1) and Cl on C2 (symmetric to C3). So Br on C4 and Cl on C2 is equivalent to Br on C1 and Cl on C3. Therefore, these are the same isomer. Therefore, Br on C1 and Cl on C3 is one unique isomer.\n\nSimilarly, Br on C1 and Cl on C2 is different from Br on C1 and Cl on C3 because the positions of Cl are different (C2 vs C3). Therefore, these are two different isomers.\n\nSo let me try to list all unique isomers for different positions:\n\nFor the straight chain:\n\nSame carbon: two isomers (Br and Cl on C1 or C2).\n\nDifferent carbons:\n\n- Positions (1,2): Br on C1 and Cl on C2\n- Positions (1,3): Br on C1 and Cl on C3 (equivalent to Br on C1 and Cl on C2 when flipped? No, as discussed, it's different)\nWait, no, earlier I thought Br on C1 and Cl on C3 is equivalent to Br on C4 and Cl on C2, which is equivalent to Br on C1 and Cl on C2? No. Wait, Br on C1 and Cl on C3 is a different isomer from Br on C1 and Cl on C2. Because Cl is on different positions.\n\nSo let's list all possible unique combinations:\n\nFor different positions:\n\n1. Br on C1 and Cl on C2\n2. Br on C1 and Cl on C3\n3. Br on C1 and Cl on C4 (which is equivalent to Br on C1 and Cl on C4, but as discussed, since C4 is symmetric to C1, but Br and Cl are different, but flipping gives Cl on C1 and Br on C4, which is same as Br on C4 and Cl on C1, which is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C4? No, because if you flip, it's Cl on C1 and Br on C4, which is same as Br on C4 and Cl on C1, which is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C4? No, because Br is on C4 and Cl on C1 is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C4 when you flip. Therefore, this is one isomer.\n\n4. Br on C2 and Cl on C3 (which is same as Br on C3 and Cl on C2 when flipped)\n5. Br on C2 and Cl on C4 (which would flip to Br on C3 and Cl on C1, which is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C3 when flipped again? Wait, maybe not. Let's think. Br on C2 and Cl on C4: flipping gives Br on C3 and Cl on C1. Since C3 is symmetric to C2 and C1 is symmetric to C4. So Br on C3 and Cl on C1 is equivalent to Br on C2 and Cl on C4. But is this a new isomer? Yes, because Br is on a secondary carbon and Cl on a terminal. Previously, we had Br on C1 and Cl on C3, which is Br on terminal and Cl on secondary. So Br on C2 and Cl on C4 is different from Br on C1 and Cl on C3? Or are they same? No, because in one case Br is on secondary and Cl on terminal, and in the other Br is on terminal and Cl on secondary. Therefore, they are different isomers. Therefore, Br on C2 and Cl on C4 is another isomer.\n\nWait, but if you flip Br on C2 and Cl on C4, you get Br on C3 and Cl on C1, which is same as Br on C2 and Cl on C1? No, because C3 is symmetric to C2, so Br on C3 is same as Br on C2, and Cl on C1 is same as Cl on C4. Therefore, Br on C2 and Cl on C1 is same as Br on C2 and Cl on C4? No, because Cl is on different positions. Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to think of actual structures.\n\nStructure 1: Br on C1, Cl on C2: CH2Br-CHCl-CH2-CH3\n\nStructure 2: Br on C1, Cl on C3: CH2Br-CH2-CHCl-CH3\n\nStructure 3: Br on C1, Cl on C4: CH2Br-CH2-CH2-CH2Cl\n\nStructure 4: Br on C2, Cl on C3: CH2CHBr-CHCl-CH3? Wait, no. Let me write properly:\n\nStructure 4: Br on C2, Cl on C3: CH2-CHBr-CHCl-CH3\n\nStructure 5: Br on C2, Cl on C4: CH2-CHBr-CH2-CH2Cl\n\nStructure 6: Br on C3, Cl on C4: same as Br on C1, Cl on C2? No, Br on C3 is same as Br on C2, Cl on C4 is same as Cl on C1. So Structure 6: CH2-CH2-CHBr-CH2Cl, which is same as Structure 5 when flipped? No, Structure 5 is CH2-CHBr-CH2-CH2Cl, whereas Structure 6 is CH2-CH2-CHBr-CH2Cl. Are these different?\n\nYes, because in Structure 5, Br is on C2 and Cl on C4, whereas in Structure 6, Br is on C3 and Cl on C4. But since C3 is symmetric to C2, Structure 6 is equivalent to Br on C2 and Cl on C4, which is Structure 5. Therefore, Structure 6 is same as Structure 5. Therefore, we don't need to count it separately.\n\nTherefore, for different positions on straight chain, we have:\n\n- Structure 1: Br on C1, Cl on C2\n- Structure 2: Br on C1, Cl on C3\n- Structure 3: Br on C1, Cl on C4\n- Structure 4: Br on C2, Cl on C3\n- Structure 5: Br on C2, Cl on C4\n\nBut Structure 6 (Br on C3, Cl on C4) is same as Structure 5.\n\nTherefore, total of 5 isomers for different positions on straight chain.\n\nPlus the 2 isomers for same carbon, total of 7 isomers from straight chain.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought same carbon had two isomers (C1 and C2). Let me confirm:\n\nSame carbon positions:\n\n- Br and Cl on C1: CHBrCl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, if both Br and Cl are on C1, it would be CBrClH-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but each carbon can have multiple substituents. Wait, for a four-carbon chain with Br and Cl on C1, the structure would be:\n\nC1: Br, Cl, two H's and one bond to C2.\n\nSo structure: BrClCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the formula is C4H8BrCl. Let me check the number of hydrogens. If two substituents are on C1, then the formula for that carbon would be Br, Cl, and two H's (since it's connected to one carbon). Then the rest of the chain would be CH2CH2CH2. Wait, but the total formula would be C4H8BrCl. Let me count:\n\nEach carbon:\n\nC1: Br, Cl, 2 H's, connected to C2.\n\nC2: connected to C1 and C3, two CH2 groups.\n\nC3: same as C2.\n\nC4: same as C1 but terminal? Wait, no. If Br and Cl are on C1, then C4 is CH3.\n\nWait, the structure would be BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Cl? No, because if both Br and Cl are on C1, it would be BrClCH2CH2CH2CH3? But that would have two substituents on C1. However, the formula would be C4H8BrCl. Let me check the number of H:\n\nC1: Br, Cl, and two H's (since it's connected to one carbon). So two H's.\n\nC2: connected to C1 and C3, so two H's.\n\nC3: same as C2.\n\nC4: connected to C3, so three H's.\n\nTotal H: 2 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 3 (C4) = 9 H? But the formula is C4H8BrCl. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nOriginal formula: C4H8BrCl. Let me calculate the number of hydrogens. For a saturated molecule with four carbons and two substituents (Br and Cl), each substituent replaces one H. So starting from C4H10, replacing two H's with Br and Cl gives C4H8BrCl. Therefore, total H is 8.\n\nBut in the above structure, if Br and Cl are on C1, then C1 has Br, Cl, and two H's. Then C2 has two H's, C3 has two H's, C4 has three H's. Total H is 2+2+2+3=9. Which is one H too many. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.\n\nAh! Because if two substituents are on the same carbon, that replaces two H's. Therefore, the total number of H's is reduced by 2. Therefore, starting from C4H10, subtract 2 H's: 10 - 2 = 8 H's. Therefore, the structure must have 8 H's. However, my previous calculation gave 9. Therefore, I must have made an error in counting.\n\nLet me recalculate for Br and Cl on C1:\n\nC1: Br, Cl, and one H (since it's connected to one carbon). Because each carbon has four bonds. Br and Cl take two bonds, one bond to C2, leaving one bond for H. Therefore, one H on C1.\n\nC2: connected to C1 and C3. Assuming it's CH2 group, but if there are no substituents, it would have two H's. But since there are no other substituents on C2, it has two H's.\n\nC3: same as C2: two H's.\n\nC4: connected to C3, has three H's.\n\nTotal H: 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 3 (C4) = 8 H. Correct. Therefore, the structure is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Cl? No, wait. If C1 has Br, Cl, and one H, then it's BrClCH2-... So the structure is BrClCH2CH2CH2CH3? But C4 is CH3, so yes. Let me count H again:\n\nC1: Br, Cl, H, connected to C2. So one H.\n\nC2: connected to C1 and C3. Assuming it's CH2, so two H's.\n\nC3: same as C2: two H's.\n\nC4: CH3, three H's.\n\nTotal H: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8. Correct. Therefore, the structure is BrClCH2CH2CH2CH3? But that would have Br and Cl on the same carbon (C1), and the rest of the chain. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the same carbon case is valid. So for same carbon positions on straight chain, we have:\n\n- Br and Cl on C1: 1 isomer\n\n- Br and Cl on C2: 1 isomer (since C2 and C3 are symmetric, Br and Cl on C3 is same as on C2)\n\nTherefore, two isomers for same carbon positions on straight chain.\n\nThen, for different positions on straight chain, we had 5 isomers (structures 1-5). Therefore, total of 7 isomers from straight chain.\n\nNow, moving on to the branched carbon skeleton: 2-methylpropane (isobutane). The carbon skeleton is:\n\n       C*\n      / | \\\n     C  C  C\n\nWait, no. For four carbons, the branched structure is 2-methylpropane? Wait, propane has three carbons. The correct name is 2-methylpropane, which is actually isobutane. The structure is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - C - CH3\n\nWait, no. Let me draw it properly. The branched structure for four carbons is:\n\nA central carbon (C2) connected to three other carbons. The structure is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - C - CH3 ?\n\nNo, wait, four carbons. The correct structure is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - C - CH2 ?\n\nNo. Let me think. The correct branched structure for four carbons is 2-methylpropane? No, propane is three carbons. The correct IUPAC name for the branched four-carbon structure is 2-methylpropane? No, that would be five carbons. Wait, no. Wait, four carbons with a branch: the parent chain is three carbons (propane), with a methyl branch on the second carbon. Therefore, 2-methylpropane. But that would be:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - CH - CH2 ?\n\nWait, no. The parent chain is propane (three carbons), with a methyl group on the second carbon. Therefore:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH3 - CH - CH3\n\nWait, that's 2-methylpropane? No, that's actually 2-methylpropane, but propane has three carbons. Adding a methyl group on the second carbon would give:\n\nCarbon positions:\n\nC1 - C2 (with methyl) - C3\n\nBut C2 already has two bonds to C1 and C3, and one bond to the methyl group. Therefore, the structure is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - C - CH2 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me write it properly:\n\nThe central carbon (C2) is connected to three CH3 groups? No, because there are only four carbons total. The structure is:\n\nA central carbon (C) connected to three other carbons. Wait, that would be four carbons: one central carbon connected to three methyl groups? No, that would be neopentane, which is C(CH3)4, but that's five carbons. For four carbons, the branched structure is:\n\nA three-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the middle carbon. So:\n\nCH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 ?\n\nNo, that would be four carbons: the parent chain is three carbons (propane), with a methyl branch on the second carbon. Therefore:\n\nCH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 ?\n\nBut that would be 2-methylpropane? No, the correct name is 2-methylpropane? No, the correct IUPAC name is 2-methylpropane, but that's actually 2-methylpropane is the same as butane? No, no. Wait, the correct name is 2-methylpropane, but that would have four carbons? Let me check:\n\nPropane is C-C-C. Adding a methyl group on C2 would give:\n\nC-C(CH3)-C. Therefore, the structure is:\n\nCH2 - C(CH3) - CH2 ?\n\nBut that would be three carbons in the parent chain (propane) with a methyl on C2, making the total number of carbons 4. Yes. So the structure is 2-methylpropane, which is also called isobutane. However, when considering substituents (Br and Cl), we need to consider the positions on this branched skeleton.\n\nSo the carbon skeleton is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - C - CH3 ?\n\nNo, that would be:\n\nThe central carbon is connected to two CH2 groups and one CH3? Wait, let me count the carbons. The parent chain is propane (three carbons). The second carbon has a methyl branch. Therefore:\n\nCarbon positions:\n\nC1 - C2 (with methyl) - C3\n\nC2 is connected to C1, C3, and a methyl group (CH3). Therefore, the structure is:\n\nCH2 - C(CH3) - CH2 ?\n\nBut that would be four carbons total? Wait, C1 is CH2, C2 is connected to C1, C3, and CH3. C3 is CH2? No, C3 would be a CH3 group because it's the end of the chain. Wait, no. If the parent chain is propane (three carbons), then C1 and C3 are CH3 groups. But if there's a methyl branch on C2, then:\n\nC1: CH3\n\nC2: connected to C1, C3, and a methyl group (so C2 is CH(CH3)2?)\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The structure of isobutane (2-methylpropane) is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - CH - CH2 ?\n\nNo, that would be three carbons with a methyl branch on the middle carbon. But with four carbons, it's:\n\nThe central carbon is connected to three other carbons. Wait, no. For four carbons, the branched structure is:\n\nOne central carbon connected to three other carbons, but that would require five carbons. Therefore, the correct structure for four carbons is a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the middle carbon. Therefore:\n\nCarbon positions:\n\nC1 - C2 - C3\n\nWith a methyl group on C2. Therefore:\n\nC1: CH2-\n\nC2: CH(CH3)-\n\nC3: CH2-\n\nBut that would make the entire structure CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, which is three carbons with a methyl branch on C2. However, that's only three carbons in the parent chain and one methyl branch, totaling four carbons. Therefore, the structure is:\n\nCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?\n\nBut that would be a four-carbon molecule? No, because the parent chain is three carbons (propane) with a methyl branch. Therefore, the total number of carbons is 3 + 1 = 4. Yes.\n\nNow, for substituents Br and Cl on this branched skeleton, we need to consider the positions.\n\nIn this structure, there are three types of carbons:\n\n- C1 and C3: terminal carbons (primary), each connected to two hydrogens and one carbon.\n\n- C2: the central carbon (tertiary), connected to three other carbons (C1, C3, and the methyl branch).\n\nAdditionally, the methyl branch on C2 is a CH3 group. However, we need to consider where Br and Cl can be attached.\n\nPossible positions for substituents:\n\n- On C1\n\n- On C2\n\n- On C3\n\n- On the methyl branch (the CH3 on C2). However, attaching a substituent to the methyl branch would require replacing one of its hydrogens. However, the methyl branch is a substituent itself. Let me clarify.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - C - CH2 ?\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\n       CH3\n        |\nCH2 - C - CH2 ?\n\nBut actually, the central carbon (C2) is connected to C1 (CH2?), the methyl group, and C3 (CH2?). Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly:\n\nThe parent chain is C1-C2-C3, with a methyl branch on C2. Therefore:\n\nC1 is CH2-, connected to C2.\n\nC2 is connected to C1, C3, and a methyl group (CH3).\n\nC3 is CH2-.\n\nBut then the entire molecule is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? But that's three carbons with a methyl branch, totaling four carbons. However, each terminal carbon (C1 and C3) has two hydrogens. Wait, but if we have Br and Cl substituents, they can be attached to any of the carbons.\n\nSo possible positions:\n\n- C1: primary carbon\n\n- C2: tertiary carbon\n\n- C3: primary carbon (same as C1)\n\n- The methyl branch on C2: which is a CH3 group. If we attach a substituent there, it would be on the methyl branch. However, the methyl branch is already a substituent on C2. But since the formula is C4H8BrCl, we need to have Br and Cl attached to the main structure.\n\nWait, but the total number of carbons is four. The methyl branch is part of the four carbons. So the methyl branch is a CH3 group attached to C2. Therefore, if we attach Br or Cl to the methyl branch, that would be on a carbon that's already part of the four-carbon skeleton. Therefore, possible positions for substituents are:\n\n- On C1\n\n- On C2\n\n- On C3\n\n- On the methyl branch (which is a carbon attached to C2)\n\nBut since the methyl branch is a single carbon (CH3), attaching a substituent there would replace one of its hydrogens. However, this would make the structure have five carbons? No, because the methyl branch is already part of the four-carbon skeleton. Let me think again. The four carbons are:\n\n- C1 (CH2-)\n\n- C2 (central, connected to C1, C3, and the methyl branch)\n\n- C3 (CH2-)\n\n- The methyl branch is a CH3 attached to C2. So that's four carbons total: C1, C2, C3, and the methyl branch.\n\nTherefore, if we attach a substituent to the methyl branch, that would be on the fourth carbon (the methyl branch). Therefore, possible positions for substituents are:\n\n- C1\n\n- C2\n\n- C3\n\n- Methyl branch (let's call this position M)\n\nHowever, note that C1 and C3 are symmetric. Therefore, substituents on C1 and C3 are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, for the branched skeleton, we need to consider substituent positions:\n\nSame carbon or different carbons.\n\nFirst, same carbon:\n\nBr and Cl on the same carbon. Possible positions:\n\n- C1 (or C3, equivalent)\n\n- C2\n\n- M (methyl branch)\n\nSo three possibilities:\n\n1. Br and Cl on C1 (or C3)\n\n2. Br and Cl on C2\n\n3. Br and Cl on M\n\nEach of these is a unique isomer because the positions are different (primary, tertiary, and methyl branch).\n\nNow, different carbons: Br and Cl on different carbons. Let's consider all possible pairs:\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- C1 and C2\n\n- C1 and C3 (equivalent to C1 and C1? No, since different carbons)\n\nWait, need to consider all unique pairs considering symmetry.\n\nSince C1 and C3 are symmetric, pairs involving C1 and another position are equivalent to those involving C3 and the same position.\n\nPossible unique pairs:\n\n- C1 and C2\n\n- C1 and M\n\n- C2 and C3 (equivalent to C1 and C2?)\n\nWait, no. Let me list all possible pairs:\n\n1. C1 and C2\n\n2. C1 and C3 (equivalent to C1 and C1? No, different carbons. But since C1 and C3 are symmetric, Br on C1 and Cl on C3 is same as Br on C3 and Cl on C1, which is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C1? No. Wait, no, it's Br on C1 and Cl on C3, which is same as Br on C3 and Cl on C1, which due to symmetry is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C1? No, that doesn't make sense. Actually, Br on C1 and Cl on C3 is same as Br on C3 and Cl on C1, which is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C1? No. It's just one isomer where Br and Cl are on symmetrically equivalent carbons.\n\nWait, if Br is on C1 and Cl is on C3, since C1 and C3 are symmetric, this is one unique isomer.\n\n3. C1 and M\n\n4. C2 and C3 (equivalent to C1 and C2?)\n\nNo, C2 and C3: since C3 is symmetric to C1, this is equivalent to C2 and C1, which is already considered in pair 1.\n\n5. C2 and M\n\n6. C3 and M (equivalent to C1 and M)\n\nTherefore, unique pairs are:\n\n- C1 and C2\n\n- C1 and C3 (which is same as C1 and C3, but symmetric, so one isomer)\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me approach it systematically.\n\nFor different positions on the branched skeleton:\n\nPossible positions for Br and Cl:\n\nCase 1: Br on C1 and Cl on C2\n\nCase 2: Br on C1 and Cl on C3 (equivalent to Br on C3 and Cl on C1, which is same as Case 1 due to symmetry? No, because in Case 1, Cl is on C2, while in this case Cl is on C3. Wait, no, if Br is on C1 and Cl is on C3, since C1 and C3 are symmetric, this is equivalent to Br on C3 and Cl on C1, which is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C3. So it's one unique isomer.\n\nCase 3: Br on C1 and Cl on M\n\nCase 4: Br on C2 and Cl on C3 (equivalent to Br on C2 and Cl on C1, which is same as Case 1)\n\nCase 5: Br on C2 and Cl on M\n\nCase 6: Br on C3 and Cl on M (equivalent to Case 3)\n\nTherefore, unique isomers for different positions on branched skeleton are:\n\n- Case 1: Br on C1 and Cl on C2\n\n- Case 2: Br on C1 and Cl on C3 (same as Br on C1 and Cl on C1? No, different positions)\n\nWait, no. Case 2 is Br on C1 and Cl on C3, which is one isomer.\n\n- Case 3: Br on C1 and Cl on M\n\n- Case 5: Br on C2 and Cl on M\n\nSo total of four isomers for different positions.\n\nAdditionally, same carbon positions give three isomers.\n\nTherefore, total isomers from branched skeleton: 3 (same) + 4 (different) = 7 isomers.\n\nBut wait, let me verify each case:\n\nSame carbon:\n\n1. Br and Cl on C1: one isomer\n\n2. Br and Cl on C2: one isomer\n\n3. Br and Cl on M: one isomer\n\nDifferent positions:\n\n1. Br on C1 and Cl on C2\n\n2. Br on C1 and Cl on C3 (equivalent to Br on C3 and Cl on C1)\n\nBut since C1 and C3 are symmetric, Br on C1 and Cl on C3 is same as Br on C3 and Cl on C1, which is same as Br on C1 and Cl on C1? No, it's different. It's Br on one terminal and Cl on the other terminal? No, Cl is on C3, which is symmetric to C1, but Br is on C1. Wait, no, if Br is on C1 and Cl is on C3, since the molecule is symmetric, this is same as Br on C3 and Cl on C1. But since Br and Cl are different, this is one unique isomer where Br and Cl are on symmetrically equivalent carbons (C1 and C3). So this is one isomer.\n\nThen, Br on C1 and Cl on M: another isomer.\n\nBr on C2 and Cl on M: another isomer.\n\nBr on C2 and Cl on C3: which is equivalent to Br on C2 and Cl on C1, which is same as Case 1 (Br on C1 and Cl on C2). Therefore, no new isomer.\n\nBr on C3 and Cl on M: same as Br on C1 and Cl on M.\n\nTherefore, total different positions isomers: 3 (Case 1, Case 2, Case 3, Case 5? Wait, earlier I said four, but now I think it's three? Let me recount.\n\nDifferent positions:\n\n- Br on C1 and Cl on C2: 1\n\n- Br on C1 and Cl on C3: 1 (symmetric)\n\n- Br on C1 and Cl on M: 1\n\n- Br on C2 and Cl on M: 1\n\nTotal of four different positions isomers.\n\nYes, because Br on C2 and Cl on M is different from the others.\n\nTherefore, total for branched skeleton: 3 + 4 = 7 isomers.\n\nTherefore, total isomers from both skeletons:\n\nStraight chain: 7 isomers\n\nBranched skeleton: 7 isomers\n\nTotal: 7 + 7 = 14 isomers?\n\nBut wait, the options are up to 14 (option D). But let me check if there are any overlaps or if I have counted correctly.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nFor straight chain:\n\nSame carbon: 2 isomers (C1 and C2)\n\nDifferent positions: 5 isomers (Br on 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4)\n\nTotal: 7.\n\nFor branched skeleton:\n\nSame carbon: 3 isomers (C1, C2, M)\n\nDifferent positions: 4 isomers (1-2, 1-3, 1-M, 2-M)\n\nTotal: 7.\n\nTotal overall: 7 + 7 = 14. So option D.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"excluding stereoisomers\". So I need to make sure that I haven't counted stereoisomers, which are not to be considered. However, in structural isomerism, stereoisomers are not counted, so my count is correct as structural isomers.\n\nBut let me verify if there are any errors in my counting.\n\nFor the straight chain:\n\nSame carbon: C1 and C2. For C1: Br and Cl on C1. For C2: Br and Cl on C2. Correct.\n\nDifferent positions: Br on 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4. Let me check each:\n\n1-2: different\n\n1-3: different\n\n1-4: different\n\n2-3: different\n\n2-4: different. Yes, five different positions. Total 7.\n\nFor the branched skeleton:\n\nSame carbon: three positions. Different positions: four. Total seven. So 7+7=14.\n\nBut wait, the options include 14 as option D. But I need to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nWait, for example, in the branched skeleton, when Br and Cl are on the methyl branch (position M), is that a valid position? Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe methyl branch is a CH3 group attached to C2. If we put Br and Cl on that methyl branch, it would be replacing two H's on that methyl group. However, the formula is C4H8BrCl. Let's check:\n\nOriginal structure of the branched skeleton without substituents: C4H10.\n\nReplacing two H's with Br and Cl gives C4H8BrCl. If Br and Cl are on the methyl branch (position M), which is a CH3 group. Replacing two H's on that methyl group would give CHBrCl- group attached to C2. So the structure would be:\n\n       CHBrCl\n        |\nCH2 - C - CH2 ?\n\nBut since the parent chain is three carbons (C1-C2-C3), with the methyl branch (now CHBrCl) on C2. This is a valid structure and contributes to an isomer.\n\nTherefore, yes, that is a valid isomer.\n\nTherefore, the count seems correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that sometimes when there are multiple substituents on the same carbon, especially in branched structures, there might be some duplicates or cases where the substituents lead to the same structure. But I don't think so in this case.\n\nTherefore, total isomers: 14. So option D.\n\nBut let me check another approach. Sometimes, the number of isomers can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of positions for Br and Cl on all possible carbon skeletons.\n\nAnother way is to consider that the problem is similar to finding the number of structural isomers for C4H8BrCl, which can be approached by considering all possible positions for Br and Cl on all possible carbon skeletons (straight and branched).\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as first determining all possible structural isomers for C4H10 with two different substituents (Br and Cl). Since each substitution replaces an H.\n\nFor each carbon skeleton (straight and branched), determine the number of unique positions for two different substituents.\n\nFor the straight chain (butane):\n\nNumber of unique positions for two different substituents is equal to the number of unique ways to place Br and Cl on the four carbons, considering symmetry.\n\nAs calculated earlier, for straight chain, there are 7 isomers.\n\nFor the branched chain (2-methylpropane):\n\nNumber of unique positions is 7 isomers.\n\nTotal 14.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D) 14 types.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in such problems, the number might be less due to some oversight. Let me check if there are any duplicates between the straight and branched isomers.\n\nFor example, is there an isomer that is counted both in straight and branched? Probably not, because the carbon skeletons are different (straight vs branched).\n\nTherefore, total isomers: 14. So option D.\n\nBut wait, let me check some references or think if there's a standard formula.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as for each carbon skeleton, calculate the number of isomers by considering the number of possible positions for Br and Cl.\n\nFor a given carbon skeleton with n carbons, the number of structural isomers with two different substituents is:\n\nNumber of ways to choose two positions (allowing same or different) multiplied by permutations (since Br and Cl are different), divided by symmetry factors.\n\nBut this might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, for each skeleton, calculate the number of unique positions for Br and Cl.\n\nFor straight chain (butane):\n\nNumber of unique positions for substituents:\n\nNumber of unique positions for one substituent is 2 (terminal) and 2 (secondary), but considering symmetry, it's 2 types: primary (C1/C4) and secondary (C2/C3).\n\nFor two different substituents:\n\nCase 1: Both on same carbon: 2 isomers (primary or secondary)\n\nCase 2: On different carbons:\n\nNumber of unique pairs considering symmetry:\n\nAs discussed earlier, 5 isomers.\n\nTotal: 7.\n\nFor branched skeleton (2-methylpropane):\n\nUnique positions for substituents:\n\nThree types of carbons: primary (C1/C3), tertiary (C2), and methyl branch (M).\n\nNumber of unique positions for same carbon: 3 isomers.\n\nFor different positions:\n\nNumber of unique pairs:\n\nBetween primary and tertiary: 1 isomer (Br on primary, Cl on tertiary)\n\nBetween primary and methyl: 1 isomer (Br on primary, Cl on methyl)\n\nBetween tertiary and methyl: 1 isomer (Br on tertiary, Cl on methyl)\n\nBetween primary and primary: Br on one primary, Cl on another primary (which are symmetric, so one isomer)\n\nWait, previously I had four different positions isomers, but according to this it's four:\n\n- primary-tertiary\n\n- primary-methyl\n\n- tertiary-methyl\n\n- primary-primary\n\nYes, four isomers. Therefore total 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nSo total isomers: 7 + 7 = 14. Hence, option D.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D) 14 types.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
