The question is about classifying chemical reactions as either heterogeneous or homogeneous. I remember that a homogeneous reaction is one where all the reactants and products are in the same phase, like all gases or all aqueous. On the other hand, a heterogeneous reaction involves reactants and/or products in different phases.\n\nLooking at the options A to D, I need to check the phases of each substance in the reactions. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: 2C₂H₂(g) + 5O₂(g) → 4CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g). All the reactants and products here are gases (g). So, they are all in the same phase. That would make this a homogeneous reaction. So A is not the answer we're looking for.\n\nOption B: C₂H₅OH(aq) + O₂(aq) → HC₂H₃O₂(aq) + H₂O(aq). Here, all substances are aqueous (aq). Aqueous means dissolved in water, so they are all in the same solution phase. Therefore, this is also a homogeneous reaction. So B is out too.\n\nOption C: C(s) + H₂O(g) → H₂(g) + CO(g). Now, here we have carbon as a solid (s), and the rest are gases. The solid is a different phase from the gaseous reactant and products. So since there are different phases involved (solid and gas), this reaction is heterogeneous. This might be the correct answer, but let me check the last one to be sure.\n\nOption D: C₂H₂(g) + 5N₂O(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(g) + 5N₂(g). All the substances here are gases. Even though there are different gases, they are all in the gaseous phase. So this is another homogeneous reaction. \n\nSo, comparing all options, only option C has reactants and products in different phases (solid and gas), making it a heterogeneous reaction. The others are all homogeneous because all substances are in the same phase. Therefore, the answer should be option C.\n</think>"}
