The problem says they have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All planets have the same albedo. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were a black body in thermal equilibrium with the radiation from its star. \n\nFirst, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the amount of stellar radiation it receives. Since all planets have the same albedo, the main factor here is how much radiation each planet receives. The radiation from the star decreases with the square of the distance from the star. So, if I can figure out the distances of Planet 4 and Planet 2 from the star, I can find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives me the orbital periods, not the distances. So I need to relate the orbital period to the distance from the star. That's Kepler's third law. Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. For planets orbiting the same star, since the mass of the star is the same, the periods are related to their orbital radii.\n\nSo, if I denote the orbital periods as P and the semi-major axis as a, then Kepler's third law (in the form suitable for when the mass of the star is much larger than the planets, which is usually the case) is:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, if I have the ratio of the orbital periods, I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\nGiven that the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me assign each planet its period:\n\nPlanet_1: P1 = 1 unit\n\nPlanet_2: P2 = 2 units\n\nPlanet_3: P3 = 2.5 units\n\nPlanet_4: P4 = 3.5 units\n\nPlanet_5: P5 = 5 units\n\nSo, for each planet, (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3, so solving for a, we get a ∝ P^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is equal to the ratio of the periods raised to the 2/3 power.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the distances (a4/a2) would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). Let me compute that first.\n\nP4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So 3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. Then, 1.75 raised to the power of 2/3. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let me convert 1.75 to a fraction. 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Alternatively, maybe decimal is easier. Let me compute 1.75^(2/3).\n\nAlternatively, since equilibrium temperature is related to the inverse square of the distance. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L / (4πσa²))^(1/4), but since all planets are orbiting the same star, the stellar luminosity L is the same for all. Also, since albedo is the same, the absorption of radiation is the same. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature should be inversely proportional to a^(1/2). Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is:\n\nT_eq = (L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²))^(1/4)\n\nWhere L is the stellar luminosity, A is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since A is the same for all planets, and L and σ are constants for all, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). Therefore, T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of T4/T2 = (T4)/(T2) = (1/√a4) / (1/√a2) ) = √(a2/a4) = (a2/a4)^(1/2).\n\nBut since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Therefore, T4/T2 = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me write down the steps:\n\nSince a ∝ P^(2/3), then a4 = k * P4^(2/3), and a2 = k * P2^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Then, T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).\n\nYes, that seems right. So the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2 is equal to (P2 / P4)^(1/3). \n\nGiven that P2 is 2 and P4 is 3.5, then the ratio is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 2 divided by 3.5. Let me calculate that. 2 / 3.5 = 0.571428...\n\nSo approximately 0.5714. Then take the cube root of that. Let me compute cube root of 0.5714.\n\nCube root of 0.5714. Let me recall that cube root of 0.5787 is approximately 0.83 because 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571. Wait, let me check:\n\n0.8^3 = 0.512\n\n0.83^3 = 0.83 * 0.83 * 0.83. Let me compute 0.83 * 0.83 first. 0.83*0.83 is 0.6889. Then multiply by 0.83:\n\n0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ Let's compute 0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112, and 0.6889 * 0.03 = 0.020667. Adding them gives 0.55112 + 0.020667 ≈ 0.571787. Which is approximately 0.5718. \n\nSo, cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 ≈ 0.83. \n\nLooking at the options, A is ~0.83. But wait, the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2. So T4 / T2 ≈ 0.83. Therefore, answer A?\n\nBut let me check again. Let me verify the steps again.\n\n1. Equilibrium temperature is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a). Correct, because flux is proportional to 1/a², and temperature is proportional to (flux)^(1/4), so 1/a^(1/2).\n\n2. a is proportional to P^(2/3). Correct, from Kepler's third law.\n\nTherefore, T ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). Correct.\n\nSo (2 / 3.5)^(1/3). 2 / 3.5 is 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. Cube root of 4/7. Let me compute 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. Cube root of 0.5714 ≈ 0.83 as above. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 0.83. So answer A.\n\nBut let me check if there is a mistake in the reasoning. For example, is the equilibrium temperature actually proportional to 1/a^(1/2)? Let me recall the formula again.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is calculated by balancing the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation from the planet.\n\nThe power absorbed by the planet is: L * (1 - A) * π R_p² / (4 π a²) = L (1 - A) R_p² / (4 a²), where R_p is the radius of the planet. Wait, but actually, the cross-sectional area is π R_p², and the power emitted by the planet is 4 π R_p² σ T_eq^4. So setting them equal:\n\nL (1 - A) π R_p² / (4 π a²) = 4 π R_p² σ T_eq^4 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me do it properly.\n\nThe power received from the star by the planet is:\n\nStellar luminosity L multiplied by the fraction that hits the planet. The star's radiation spreads out over a sphere of area 4πa², so the flux at the planet is L / (4πa²). The power absorbed by the planet is this flux multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the planet, which is πR_p², multiplied by (1 - A), since A is the albedo (fraction reflected). So:\n\nP_absorbed = (L / 4πa²) * π R_p² * (1 - A) = L R_p² (1 - A) / (4 a²)\n\nThe power emitted by the planet as thermal radiation is:\n\nP_emitted = 4π R_p² σ T_eq^4\n\nSetting P_absorbed = P_emitted:\n\nL R_p² (1 - A) / (4 a²) = 4 π R_p² σ T_eq^4 \n\nWait, but the left side is L R_p² (1 - A) / (4 a²) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the P_absorbed is equal to P_emitted. So:\n\n(L * (1 - A) * π R_p²) / (4 π a²) ) = 4 π R_p² σ T_eq^4 ?\n\nWait, no, the units don't match. Let me check again.\n\nActually, the power absorbed is:\n\nFlux from the star at distance a is L / (4πa²). Multiply by the cross-sectional area of the planet, which is π R_p². Then multiply by (1 - A) for the absorbed fraction. So:\n\nP_absorbed = (L / (4πa²)) * π R_p² * (1 - A) = (L R_p² (1 - A)) / (4 a²)\n\nThen the power emitted by the planet is:\n\nP_emitted = 4 π R_p² σ T_eq^4\n\nSo setting equal:\n\n(L R_p² (1 - A)) / (4 a²) = 4 π R_p² σ T_eq^4 \n\nWait, but here, the left side is (L (1 - A)) / (4 a²) multiplied by R_p², and the right side is 4 π R_p² σ T_eq^4. So cancelling R_p² from both sides:\n\n(L (1 - A)) / (4 a²) = 4 π σ T_eq^4 \n\nSolving for T_eq:\n\nT_eq^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nT_eq = [ L (1 - A) / (16 π σ) ]^(1/4) * 1 / a^(1/2)\n\nSo indeed, T_eq is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a). So my previous reasoning was correct. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Therefore, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). Since a ∝ P^(2/3), then T ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n\nSo with P2 = 2, P4 = 3.5, the ratio is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83. Therefore, answer A: ~0.83.\n\nBut let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, maybe I got the ratio inverted? Like, is it T4 / T2 or T2 / T4?\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2. So that's T4 / T2. Since Planet 4 is farther out (larger orbital period) than Planet 2, it should have a lower equilibrium temperature. Therefore, T4 / T2 should be less than 1. Which 0.83 is. So that makes sense. If Planet 4 is farther away, it's colder, so the ratio is less than 1. So answer A is 0.83. But let me check the options again. The options are A: ~0.83, B: ~0.69, C: ~0.75, D: ~0.57.\n\nBut maybe my approximation of cube root of 0.5714 as 0.83 is slightly off? Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.5714^(1/3). Let me use logarithms. Let me take natural logarithm of 0.5714. ln(0.5714) ≈ ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.5714) is between those. Let me calculate:\n\n0.5714 is approximately 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.\n\nLet me compute ln(4/7) = ln(4) - ln(7) ≈ 1.3863 - 1.9459 ≈ -0.5596.\n\nThen divide by 3: -0.5596 / 3 ≈ -0.1865. Then exponentiate: e^(-0.1865) ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^(-0.1865) ≈ 1 - 0.1865 + ... using Taylor series, but maybe better to remember that ln(0.83) ≈ ?\n\nLet me recall that ln(0.8) ≈ -0.2231, ln(0.83) ≈ ?\n\nLet me calculate ln(0.83). Let me use calculator-like approach. Let me remember that ln(0.83) ≈ ?\n\nWell, e^(-0.1865) ≈ ?\n\nLet me note that e^(-0.1865) ≈ 1 / e^0.1865. Let me approximate e^0.1865. \n\nWe know that e^0.18 ≈ 1.1972, e^0.2 ≈ 1.2214. Let me compute e^0.1865. Let me use the Taylor series around 0. Let me take x = 0.1865.\n\ne^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24.\n\nx = 0.1865\n\nx² ≈ 0.0348\n\nx³ ≈ 0.00648\n\nx^4 ≈ 0.00120\n\nSo e^x ≈ 1 + 0.1865 + 0.0348/2 + 0.00648/6 + 0.00120/24 ≈ 1 + 0.1865 + 0.0174 + 0.00108 + 0.00005 ≈ 1 + 0.1865 + 0.0174 + 0.00113 ≈ 1.204. So e^0.1865 ≈ 1.204, so 1/1.204 ≈ 0.83. Which matches the previous estimation. Therefore, e^(-0.1865) ≈ 0.83. Therefore, the cube root of 0.5714 is indeed approximately 0.83. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 0.83. So answer A.\n\nBut let me check if there is any chance that I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me go through the exponents again.\n\nWe have T ∝ 1 / a^(1/2), and a ∝ P^(2/3). Therefore, T ∝ 1 / [P^(2/3)]^(1/2) = 1 / P^(1/3). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (T4 / T1) / (T2 / T1) = [P1 / P4]^(1/3) / [P1 / P2]^(1/3) ) = [ (P1 / P4) / (P1 / P2) ]^(1/3) ) = [ P2 / P4 ]^(1/3). So yes, same result. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we take Planet_1's period as 1, then its a is proportional to 1^(2/3) = 1. Then Planet_2 has a period of 2, so a2 is proportional to 2^(2/3). Similarly, a4 is proportional to 3.5^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio a2/a4 is [2^(2/3)] / [3.5^(2/3)] = (2 / 3.5)^(2/3). Then T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = [ (2 / 3.5)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3). Same result. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, answer A: ~0.83.\n\nBut let me check if the multiple-choice options might have a trick. For example, maybe the question is about the ratio T2 / T4 instead? But the question says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2\", which is T4 / T2. If it were T2 / T4, then it would be 1 / 0.83 ≈ 1.2, but that's not an option. So no, the answer must be A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the cube root? Let me verify with logarithms again. Let me use base 10 logs for calculation.\n\nlog10(0.5714) ≈ log10(5.714 × 10^-1) ≈ log10(5.714) - 1 ≈ 0.7568 - 1 = -0.2432.\n\nThen divide by 3 (since cube root is exponent 1/3), so log10(result) ≈ -0.2432 / 3 ≈ -0.081. Then 10^(-0.081) ≈ ?\n\n10^(-0.081) = 1 / 10^(0.081). 10^0.08 ≈ 1.199 (since 10^0.07918 ≈ 1.199). So 1 / 1.199 ≈ 0.834. Therefore, approximately 0.83. Same result. So answer A.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: ~0.83.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
