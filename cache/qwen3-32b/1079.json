So, we have compounds A, B, and C with their molecular formulas and 1H NMR data. We need to determine which of the given options (A to D) correctly identifies the reactants and the reaction type leading to product C.\n\nFirst, let's look at compound A: C6H13Br. The 1H NMR has 3 signals, one singlet, and two triplets. Hmm. So three distinct sets of protons. The singlet suggests a group of protons that are all equivalent and not adjacent to any other protons. The triplets would indicate protons adjacent to two equivalent protons (since triplet is n+1 where n=2). \n\nLet me think about possible structures for A. C6H13Br. The formula is C6H13Br. The degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X)/2. Let me calculate that. Carbon is 6, H is 13, X is 1 (bromine). So (2*6 + 2 -13 -1)/2 = (12 +2 -14)/2 = 0/2 = 0. So no double bonds or rings. So it's a saturated compound, probably an alkyl bromide.\n\nNow, the NMR has three signals. A singlet, two triplets. Let's think of possible structures. For example, if there's a singlet, maybe a methyl group attached to a carbon that's adjacent to a bromine? Like in something like (CH3)3CCH2CH2Br? Wait, but that might not give three signals. Alternatively, maybe a structure where there are two equivalent methyl groups adjacent to a central carbon. For example, 3,3-dimethylbutyl bromide. Let me try to sketch this.\n\nIf A is 3-bromo-3,4,4-trimethylpentane? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let's consider the formula C6H13Br. Let's think of possible isomers. For example, 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane. Let's check the structure. The parent chain is butane, with two methyl groups on C3, and a bromo on C1. So the structure would be CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's count the protons. \n\nThe CH2Br group is adjacent to a CH2 group. Then the central carbon is C(CH3)2, so two methyl groups attached to it. The terminal is CH3. So the NMR signals:\n\n- The terminal CH3: adjacent to CH2-C(CH3)2, so if there are two methyl groups on the central carbon, they might be equivalent. The CH2Br would be adjacent to CH2, so that CH2 would have protons adjacent to two different groups. Wait, maybe the NMR signals would be:\n\n- The CH2Br: protons here would be adjacent to CH2 (so maybe a triplet? Because if there are two protons on the adjacent carbon, but maybe there's symmetry. Wait, let's see. The structure is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. The CH2Br is adjacent to CH2, which is adjacent to the central carbon with two methyl groups. The central carbon is C(CH3)2, so two methyl groups attached. Each methyl group is equivalent? So the two methyl groups would have the same signal. The terminal CH3 is on the end.\n\nSo the protons would be:\n\n- The terminal CH3: adjacent to CH2-C(CH3)2. So maybe that's a triplet? Because it's adjacent to two protons on the CH2. But if the central carbon is C(CH3)2, then the CH2 is between CH2Br and C(CH3)2. So the CH2 in the middle would have two protons. The terminal CH3 would be adjacent to that CH2, so their protons would split into a triplet (since n=2 for adjacent protons). Then the CH2Br would be adjacent to the CH2, so their protons would split into a triplet as well. The two methyl groups on the central carbon would be adjacent to the CH2, so their protons would split into a triplet? Wait, but maybe there's symmetry. Wait, the central carbon is C(CH3)2, so the two methyl groups are equivalent. The protons on the methyl groups would be adjacent to the CH2, which has two protons. So each methyl group would have protons split into a triplet. But since there are two equivalent methyl groups, their signals would merge into one triplet. Then the terminal CH3 would be another triplet. The CH2Br would be adjacent to CH2, so another triplet. Wait, but the question says there is one singlet and two triplets. So where is the singlet?\n\nAh, maybe the two methyl groups on the central carbon are not adjacent to any protons. Wait, no. They are attached to the central carbon, which is connected to the CH2. So their protons would be adjacent to the CH2. So if the central carbon is C(CH3)2, then the methyl protons are adjacent to the CH2 (which has two protons). So their splitting would be triplet. But maybe there's another set of protons that are not adjacent to any other protons. Wait, maybe the terminal CH3 is adjacent to the CH2, so triplet. The CH2Br is adjacent to CH2, triplet. The two methyl groups on the central carbon are adjacent to CH2, so triplet. That would make three triplets, but the question says one singlet and two triplets. Hmm, so maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutane. Let me draw that: CH2Br-CH(CH2CH3)-C(CH3)2. Wait, no, the formula is C6H13Br. Let me count atoms. For example, 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane: the structure is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's count the protons:\n\n- The CH2Br has two protons. Adjacent to CH2 (two protons), so triplet.\n\n- The central CH2 (between CH2Br and C(CH3)2) has two protons. Adjacent to CH2Br and to the central carbon. So adjacent to two protons on the CH2Br side and maybe the central carbon? Wait, the central carbon is C(CH3)2. The CH2 is adjacent to that carbon. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the central carbon (which has no protons) and the CH2Br. So maybe the splitting is due to the CH2Br side. So the CH2 in the middle would have protons adjacent to two protons (from CH2Br) and adjacent to the central carbon (which has no protons). So maybe the splitting is triplet (from the two protons on CH2Br side). Then the protons on the central carbon's methyl groups: each methyl group is adjacent to the CH2 (two protons). So their protons would split into triplet. But since there are two equivalent methyl groups, their signals would combine into one triplet. The terminal CH3 is adjacent to the central carbon's CH2? Wait, no, the terminal is CH3 attached to the central carbon. Wait, the structure is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So the terminal CH3 is attached to the central carbon (C(CH3)2). The central carbon is connected to the CH2. So the terminal CH3's protons are adjacent to the CH2 (two protons), so they would split into triplet. So in total, three triplets. But the NMR data says one singlet and two triplets. So this suggests that my structure is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe there's a singlet. A singlet would mean protons that are not adjacent to any other protons. How can that happen? If there's a methyl group attached to a carbon that's adjacent to a carbon with no protons. For example, if there's a methyl group attached to a carbon that is adjacent to a quaternary carbon (no protons). Let me think. For example, in 2-bromo-2-methylbutane, the methyl groups on the central carbon would be adjacent to a carbon with no protons. Wait, but that's a different structure. Let me try to think again.\n\nLet's take another approach. The molecular formula is C6H13Br. Let's calculate the number of protons. The formula is C6H13Br. The degree of unsaturation is zero, as calculated before. So it's a saturated compound. The NMR has three signals: one singlet, two triplets. Let's consider possible structures.\n\nA singlet usually comes from protons that are not adjacent to any other protons. So maybe there's a methyl group attached to a quaternary carbon. For example, if there's a central carbon with multiple methyl groups attached. Let's think about 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutane. Structure: CH2Br-CH(CH2CH3)-C(CH3)2. Wait, but that might not fit. Let me count the atoms. The formula would be C6H13Br. Let me check:\n\nParent chain butane: C4. Two methyl groups on C2, one bromo on C3. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane. Structure: CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's check the protons again. The CH2Br is adjacent to CH2 (two protons). The central carbon is C(CH3)2, so two methyl groups. The terminal is CH3. The protons on the terminal CH3 are adjacent to the central carbon's CH2? Wait, no, the terminal CH3 is attached to the central carbon. The central carbon is connected to the CH2. So the terminal CH3 is adjacent to the central carbon (which is connected to two methyl groups and a CH2). The protons on the terminal CH3 are adjacent to the central carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the terminal CH3 would be a singlet. Because there are no protons adjacent to it. That's a key point! If the terminal CH3 is attached to a carbon that has no protons (like the central carbon in this case), then the protons on the terminal CH3 would not split, so they would be a singlet. \n\nSo in the structure CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3:\n\n- The terminal CH3 (attached to C(CH3)2) has protons that are not adjacent to any protons (since the adjacent carbon has no protons), so it's a singlet.\n\n- The CH2Br has protons adjacent to CH2 (two protons), so triplet.\n\n- The CH2 in the middle (between CH2Br and C(CH3)2) has protons adjacent to CH2Br (two protons) and adjacent to C(CH3)2 (which has no protons). So the splitting would be triplet from the two protons on the CH2Br side. So that's another triplet.\n\nSo total three signals: one singlet (terminal CH3), two triplets (CH2Br and the CH2 in the middle). That matches the NMR data for compound A. Therefore, compound A is 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane. \n\nNow, compound B: C4H6. The NMR has three signals: one singlet, one triplet, and one quartet. Let's analyze this. Molecular formula C4H6. Degree of unsaturation: (2*4 + 2 -6)/2 = (8 +2 -6)/2 = 4/2 = 2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Could be a triple bond, two double bonds, a ring plus a double bond, etc. Given that it's an alkyne (since the answer options mention but-1-yne and but-2-yne), let's consider that possibility. \n\nIf compound B is but-1-yne (HC≡C-CH2CH3), then the structure is HC≡C-CH2CH3. The NMR signals would be:\n\n- The terminal alkyne proton (HC≡) is usually not observed in 1H NMR because alkynes are not protonated. Wait, but maybe the question is considering the alkyne as part of the structure, and the protons on the adjacent carbons. Wait, in but-1-yne, the structure is HC≡C-CH2CH3. The protons on the CH2CH3 groups. The CH2 adjacent to the triple bond would have two protons, and the CH3 would have three protons. The splitting would be:\n\n- The CH2 next to the triple bond (C≡C-CH2-CH3): the protons here are adjacent to the triple bond carbon (which has no protons) and adjacent to CH3. So the splitting would be from the CH3 (three protons), so the CH2 protons would split into a quartet (n+1 where n=3). The CH3 protons are adjacent to the CH2 (two protons), so they would split into a triplet. Additionally, the terminal alkyne proton (HC≡) is not observed in 1H NMR. So the NMR would have two signals: a quartet (from CH2) and a triplet (from CH3). But the question says three signals: one singlet, one triplet, one quartet. Hmm, that doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, if compound B is but-2-yne (CH3-C≡C-CH3). In this case, the structure is symmetrical. The two methyl groups are equivalent. The protons on the methyl groups would all be equivalent. So the NMR would have one signal for the methyl protons (a singlet, since they are adjacent to the triple bond carbon which has no protons). But there are no other protons. So the NMR would have one singlet. But the question says three signals. So that's not matching. \n\nWait, perhaps compound B is a different structure. Let's think again. The molecular formula is C4H6. Let's consider other possibilities. If it's an alkyne with a different structure. For example, maybe it's vinylacetylene or something else. But let's stick to the answer options. The options mention but-1-yne and but-2-yne. Let's check again.\n\nIf compound B is but-1-yne (HC≡C-CH2CH3), the NMR would have two signals: the CH2 (quartet) and CH3 (triplet). But the question says three signals. So maybe there's another set of protons. Wait, perhaps the triple bond is not terminal. Wait, but-1-yne is HC≡C-CH2CH3. The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on CH2 and CH3. So only two signals. How can there be three signals? Maybe the structure is different. \n\nAlternatively, compound B could be 1-butyne with a substituent? No, the formula is C4H6. Let me check the degree of unsaturation again. Two degrees. If it's a triple bond, that's one degree of unsaturation. Wait, no. A triple bond is two degrees of unsaturation (since it's equivalent to two double bonds). Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X)/2. For C4H6, it's (8 +2 -6)/2= 4/2=2. So two degrees. A triple bond would account for two degrees. So if compound B has a triple bond, that's the case. \n\nBut if compound B is but-1-yne, then as discussed, two signals. If it's but-2-yne, one signal. So neither matches the three signals. Hmm. Maybe compound B is not an alkyne? Let's consider other possibilities. For example, a cyclic compound with one double bond. But the answer options suggest that B is an alkyne. Alternatively, maybe it's a diene? For example, 1,3-butadiene (CH2=CH-CH2-CH2?), but the formula would be C4H6. Let me check. 1,3-butadiene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2? No, the correct structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3? No, that would be pentene. Wait, 1,3-butadiene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2? No, it's CH2=CH-CH=CH2. The formula is C4H6. Yes, that's correct. For 1,3-butadiene, the NMR would have signals for the two CH2 groups. But the structure is CH2=CH-CH=CH2. The protons on the first CH2 are adjacent to CH (from the double bond), so maybe they would split into a quartet? Wait, but in reality, the protons on the first CH2 are adjacent to the CH group (which has one proton), so they would split into a doublet. Similarly for the other CH2. But since the molecule is symmetrical, there would be two signals: a doublet and a singlet? No, maybe two doublets. But the question says three signals. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe compound B is something else. Let me think again. The NMR data for compound B has three signals: one singlet, one triplet, and one quartet. The molecular formula is C4H6. Let's think of a structure where there are three distinct proton environments. For example, if there's a methyl group attached to a triple bond and another methyl group. Wait, but with C4H6, maybe it's 3-methyl-1-butyne? No, that would be C5H8. Wait, maybe it's 2-butyne with a substituent? No. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted alkyne. Wait, perhaps it's vinyl acetylene? But that's C4H4. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe compound B is 1-pentyne but that's C5H8. Not matching. Hmm. Let me check the answer options again. The options mention but-1-yne and but-2-yne. Let's consider that maybe the NMR of but-1-yne includes the triple bond proton. Wait, but alkynes are not protonated in the triple bond (the triple bond is between two carbons). The protons on the adjacent carbons. In but-1-yne (HC≡C-CH2CH3), the protons on the CH2 and CH3. The CH2 is adjacent to the triple bond and the CH3. The CH3 is adjacent to the CH2. The splitting would be:\n\n- The CH2 protons: adjacent to CH3 (three protons), so quartet.\n\n- The CH3 protons: adjacent to CH2 (two protons), so triplet.\n\nBut that's two signals. Where is the third signal? Maybe the triple bond has a proton? No, in but-1-yne, the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The proton is on C1 as HC≡C-... Wait, no. The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The first carbon has one proton (HC≡), but that's a proton on a sp hybridized carbon. However, in 1H NMR, alkynes are not usually observed because the protons are not present (the triple bond is between two carbons, and the first carbon has a proton). Wait, but in but-1-yne, the structure is HC≡C-CH2CH3. The first carbon has a proton (HC≡), which is a proton on a sp hybridized carbon. These protons are usually observed in NMR, but they are very deshielded and appear at around 2-3 ppm. However, if the NMR data for compound B includes this proton, then there would be three signals:\n\n- The HC≡ proton: singlet (since it's adjacent to no protons).\n\n- The CH2 protons: quartet (adjacent to CH3).\n\n- The CH3 protons: triplet (adjacent to CH2).\n\nSo that would give three signals: one singlet, one quartet, one triplet. Which matches the NMR data for compound B. Therefore, compound B is but-1-yne (HC≡C-CH2CH3). \n\nSo now, compound A is 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane, and compound B is but-1-yne. The reaction between them would form compound C. Let's look at the options.\n\nOption A: Nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne. \n\nOption C: Nucleophilic substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.\n\nOption D: Nucleophilic substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.\n\nWait, but compound A is C6H13Br. If the correct structure is 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane, then the options A and C mention this. Let's check the reaction. The reaction between an alkyl bromide and an alkyne. Typically, this would be a nucleophilic substitution where the alkyne acts as a nucleophile (after deprotonation to form an acetylide ion). \n\nIn a nucleophilic substitution reaction, the acetylide ion would attack the alkyl bromide, displacing the bromide ion. For example, the reaction would be:\n\nR-Br + RC≡C^-Na+ → R-C≡C-R' + NaBr\n\nSo if compound A is 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane (structure CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3) and compound B is but-1-yne (HC≡C-CH2CH3), then the product would be formed by substitution of Br with the acetylide group. The product would be the alkyne where the R group from A is attached to the acetylide from B.\n\nSo the structure of A is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. The R group here is CH2CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the R group would be the alkyl group attached to the bromine. In this case, the bromine is on the CH2Br group. The rest of the molecule is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So when the acetylide attacks, the product would be:\n\nThe acetylide (from B, which is HC≡C-CH2CH3) would attack the alkyl bromide (A), leading to the product where the acetylide is attached to the carbon where the Br was. So the product would be:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of A is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So the bromine is on the CH2Br group. The rest of the molecule is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. When the acetylide attacks, it replaces the Br. So the product would be:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3? No, that's not correct. The product would be the alkyl group from A attached to the acetylide. Let's build it step by step.\n\nThe alkyl group from A is CH2CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Wait, no. The structure is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So when the Br is replaced, the product is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3 attached to the acetylide. Wait, no. The acetylide would replace the Br. So the product would be:\n\nThe acetylide (HC≡C-CH2CH3) attached to the carbon where the Br was. The original structure is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So after substitution, it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3? No, that's not right. Let me draw it properly. The original molecule is:\n\nCH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3.\n\nAfter substitution, the Br is replaced by the acetylide group (from B). So the product is:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3?\n\nWait, no. The acetylide would attach to the carbon where the Br was. So the structure would be:\n\nThe acetylide (from B) is HC≡C-CH2CH3. When it attacks the CH2Br group, it would form:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3? No, that's not possible. Let me think again. The acetylide is a nucleophile, so it would attack the electrophilic carbon (the one with Br). The structure would be:\n\nThe carbon where Br was is now attached to the acetylide. So the product is:\n\nThe original CH2 group (from A) becomes CH2 attached to the acetylide. Wait, the original structure is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. The Br is on the first CH2. So after substitution, that CH2 becomes CH2-C≡C-... So the product would be:\n\nCH2-C≡C-... attached to the rest of the molecule. The rest of the molecule is -CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So the full structure would be:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. But wait, where is the rest of the acetylide from B? Because B is but-1-yne (HC≡C-CH2CH3). So the acetylide is HC≡C-CH2CH3. When it attacks the CH2Br, the product would be:\n\nThe CH2Br becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then the rest of the molecule is -CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So the full structure is:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a longer chain. Let me count the carbons.\n\nOriginal A: C6H13Br. After substitution, the product would have the same number of carbons as A plus the carbons from B minus one (since the acetylide replaces the Br). Wait, B is C4H6. The product would have C6 + C4 - 1 (since the Br is replaced by the acetylide, which is C4H5^-). So total carbons would be 6 + 4 - 1 = 9? But compound C is C10H18. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, compound C is C10H18. Let's check the formula. The reaction between A (C6H13Br) and B (C4H6) would produce C. The formula of C is C10H18. Let's verify:\n\nThe reaction would be a substitution where Br is replaced by the acetylide group. The acetylide from B is C4H5^- (since B is C4H6, and the acetylide would be C4H5^-). So the product would be A (C6H13) + acetylide (C4H5) → C10H18. Let's calculate:\n\nC6H13 (from A without Br) + C4H5 (acetylide) → C10H18. Yes, because 6 +4 =10 carbons, and 13 +5 =18 hydrogens. That matches the formula of C. So the product is indeed formed by combining the alkyl group from A and the acetylide from B.\n\nNow, what is the structure? The alkyl group from A is CH2CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Wait, the structure of A is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So the alkyl group (after removing Br) is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. When combined with the acetylide from B (HC≡C-CH2CH3), the product would be:\n\nCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, the acetylide is attached to the carbon where Br was. So the structure is:\n\nThe acetylide is attached to the CH2 group that was originally connected to Br. So the structure would be:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Wait, but that's a longer chain. Let's count the carbons:\n\n- The acetylide part: HC≡C-CH2CH3 is 4 carbons (1 for HC≡C, then CH2CH3 is 2 more, total 3? Wait, HC≡C-CH2CH3 is 1 (HC≡C) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 3 carbons? No, HC≡C is two carbons (C1 and C2), then CH2CH3 is two more (C3 and C4). So total 4 carbons. The alkyl part from A is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's count that:\n\nCH2 (1) - CH2 (2) - C(CH3)2 (3) - CH3 (4). So four carbons. So total in the product would be 4 (from A) + 4 (from B) = 8? But the product is C10H18. Wait, no. Wait, the alkyl group from A is C6H13. The acetylide from B is C4H5. So total carbons 6 +4=10. So the structure must have 10 carbons. Let me try to draw it properly.\n\nThe product is formed by substituting the Br in A with the acetylide from B. The original A is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. The Br is on the first CH2. When replaced by the acetylide (HC≡C-CH2CH3), the product becomes:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's count the carbons:\n\n- The CH2 (1) - C≡C (2 and 3) - CH2CH3 (4 and 5) - CH2 (6) - C(CH3)2 (7) - CH3 (8). Wait, that's only 8 carbons. But the product should be C10H18. So I must have made a mistake in the structure.\n\nWait, the acetylide from B is HC≡C-CH2CH3. That's four carbons: the two from the triple bond and the two from the CH2CH3. The alkyl group from A is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Removing Br gives CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3, which is four carbons. So total 4 +4 =8. But the product is C10H18. So something's wrong here. \n\nWait, maybe the structure of A is different. Earlier, I thought A is 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane. Let's confirm the molecular formula. 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane: the structure is CH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's count the carbons: 1 (CH2Br) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (C(CH3)2) + 1 (CH3) = 4 carbons? No, wait, the parent chain is butane (4 carbons). The structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2Br\n\nCarbon 2: CH2\n\nCarbon 3: C(CH3)2\n\nCarbon 4: CH3\n\nSo yes, four carbons in the parent chain. The formula is C4H9Br? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is C6H13Br. How can that be? Let's count the atoms in the structure:\n\nCH2Br-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3:\n\nCarbon count: 1 (CH2Br) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (C) + 1 (CH3) = 4 carbons? Wait, no. The C(CH3)2 is a central carbon with two methyl groups. So that's one carbon (central) and two methyl groups (each CH3). So total carbons:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2Br (1 carbon)\n\nCarbon 2: CH2 (1 carbon)\n\nCarbon 3: C(CH3)2 (1 carbon) + two methyl groups (2 carbons each? No, each methyl is one carbon, so two methyl groups is 2 carbons)\n\nCarbon 4: CH3 (1 carbon)\n\nTotal carbons: 1 +1 +1 +2 +1 = 6? No, the parent chain is butane (4 carbons), but with two methyl branches on carbon 3. So the total number of carbons is 4 (parent) + 2 (methyl groups) = 6. Yes, so the formula is C6H13Br. Correct. \n\nSo the alkyl group from A (after removing Br) is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. That's four carbons in the parent chain plus two methyl branches, totaling 6 carbons. When combined with the acetylide from B (which is four carbons), the product should have 6 +4 =10 carbons. Let's build it:\n\nThe acetylide from B is HC≡C-CH2CH3. When attached to the carbon where Br was in A, the structure becomes:\n\nThe original CH2Br becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then the rest of the molecule is -CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. So the full structure is:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's count the carbons:\n\n- CH2 (1) - C≡C (2 and 3) - CH2CH3 (4 and 5) - CH2 (6) - C(CH3)2 (7) - CH3 (8). Wait, that's only 8 carbons. Where are the other two? \n\nAh, I think I'm missing the two methyl groups on carbon 3. The structure is:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. The C(CH3)2 is carbon 7 with two methyl groups (carbons 8 and 9), and the terminal CH3 is carbon 10. So total carbons:\n\n1 (CH2) + 2 (C≡C) + 2 (CH2CH3) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (C(CH3)2) + 1 (CH3) + 2 (methyl groups on C(CH3)2) = 1+2+2+1+1+1+2=10. Yes, that's correct. So the structure is a 10-carbon molecule with a triple bond in the middle. \n\nNow, what is the IUPAC name of this compound? Let's try to name it. The longest chain containing the triple bond would be the longest possible. The structure is:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's try to draw it properly:\n\nThe triple bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Let's see:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2-\n\nCarbon 2: C≡C-\n\nCarbon 3: CH2CH3-\n\nCarbon 4: CH2-\n\nCarbon 5: C(CH3)2-\n\nCarbon 6: CH3\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the longest chain is oct-3-yne with two methyl groups. Let's see:\n\nIf the triple bond is between carbons 3 and 4 of an octane chain, then the structure would be:\n\nCH2-CH2-CH2-C≡C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with methyl groups. But in our case, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's try to find the longest chain. \n\nStarting from the left: CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's count from the triple bond. The triple bond is between C2 and C3. If we extend the chain to the right, we have CH2CH3 (C4), CH2 (C5), C(CH3)2 (C6), CH3 (C7). To the left, we have CH2 (C1). So the longest chain might be from C1 to C7, but there's a branch. Alternatively, maybe the longest chain is from the triple bond to the right. Let's try to number to give the triple bond the lowest possible number. \n\nIf we number from the left, the triple bond is between C2 and C3. The longest chain would be from C1 to C7, but there's a methyl group on C6. Wait, the C(CH3)2 is on C6, which is part of the main chain? Or is it a branch? Let me try to draw it again.\n\nThe structure is:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The leftmost CH2 is attached to the triple bond (C≡C).\n\n- The triple bond is between two carbons: let's call them C1 and C2 (C≡C).\n\nWait, maybe I should renumber. Let's consider the triple bond as the central part. Suppose the triple bond is between C3 and C4 of an octane chain. Then the structure would be:\n\nCH2-CH2-CH2-C≡C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But our structure has additional methyl groups. \n\nAlternatively, the product is 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne. Let's see: oct-3-yne has a triple bond between C3 and C4. If there are methyl groups on C6 and C7, that would be 6,7-dimethyl. Let's check:\n\nStructure of oct-3-yne: CH2CH2CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Adding methyl groups on C6 and C7 would give CH2CH2CH2-C≡C-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)CH3. But that's not matching our structure. \n\nWait, our product has the structure derived from combining A and B. A is 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane, which contributes a CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3 group. B is but-1-yne, contributing HC≡C-CH2CH3. When combined, the product is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's try to name this.\n\nThe longest chain containing the triple bond would be from the triple bond to the right. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the triple bond (C≡C), we have:\n\nC≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. That's a chain of 5 carbons on one side. On the other side of the triple bond, we have CH2- from the left. So total chain length is 5 + 1 =6? No, the triple bond is between two carbons. Let me try to count properly.\n\nThe full structure is:\n\nLeft side: CH2-\n\nTriple bond: C≡C-\n\nRight side: CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3.\n\nSo the total chain length from the triple bond would be:\n\nOn the left: one carbon (CH2).\n\nOn the right: CH2CH3 (two carbons), then CH2 (one), then C(CH3)2 (one), then CH3 (one). So total from the triple bond to the right is 2 +1 +1 +1 =5. So the longest chain would be the left side (1) plus the right side (5), totaling 6. But the triple bond is in the middle. Wait, maybe the longest chain is through the triple bond. Let's try to find the longest possible chain that includes the triple bond.\n\nIf we go from the left CH2 through the triple bond to the right side:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3.\n\nIf we consider the longest chain that includes the triple bond, it would be:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. But the CH2CH3 is a branch. Wait, perhaps the longest chain is:\n\nStarting from the left CH2, through the triple bond, then CH2, CH2, C(CH3)2, CH3. That's 5 carbons from the triple bond to the right, plus one on the left, total 6. But the triple bond is between two carbons. Let me try to number to give the triple bond the lowest number.\n\nIf we number from the left:\n\n1: CH2-\n\n2: C≡C-\n\n3: CH2CH3-\n\n4: CH2-\n\n5: C(CH3)2-\n\n6: CH3\n\nBut this gives a triple bond between 2 and 3. The longest chain would be from 1 to 6, which is six carbons. The triple bond is between 2 and 3. The name would be 2,3-dimethyloct-2-yne? No, wait. Let's see. If the longest chain is six carbons with the triple bond between 2 and 3, and there are methyl groups on carbons 5 and 6? Or maybe not. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's look at the answer options. Option A says the product is 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne. Option C says 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne. Option D is a different compound. \n\nIf the product is 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne, that would mean an octane chain with a triple bond between C3 and C4, and methyl groups on C6 and C7. Let's see if our structure fits this. \n\nThe structure from combining A and B would have the triple bond in the middle of the chain, with two methyl groups on the right side. If the longest chain is oct-3-yne, then the methyl groups would be on C6 and C7. Let's imagine:\n\nOct-3-yne: CH2CH2CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Adding methyl groups on C6 and C7 would give CH2CH2CH2-C≡C-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)CH3. But our structure has the methyl groups on the C(CH3)2 part. \n\nAlternatively, if the product is 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne, that would mean two methyl groups on C7. \n\nGiven that compound A has two methyl groups on the central carbon (3,3-dimethyl), when combined with the acetylide from B, those methyl groups would be on the same carbon in the product. So in the product, there would be two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, which would be on the right side of the triple bond. If the longest chain is oct-3-yne, then those methyl groups would be on C7 and C7 (since they are on the same carbon), making it 7,7-dimethyl. \n\nSo if the product is 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne, that would match option C. Let's check the structure:\n\nOct-3-yne: CH2CH2CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Adding two methyl groups on C7: CH2CH2CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's not right. Wait, if the two methyl groups are on the same carbon, it would be CH2CH2CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2-C(CH3)2. But that would be a longer chain. \n\nAlternatively, if the product is 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne, the structure would be:\n\nCH2-CH2-CH2-C≡C-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. But that would be a nonane chain, not octane. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's go back to the options. The options mention specific products. \n\nOption A: 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.\n\nOption C: 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.\n\nOption D: 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.\n\nWe need to determine which one matches the structure derived from A and B. \n\nGiven that A is 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane (which contributes two methyl groups on the same carbon), and B is but-1-yne, the product should have those two methyl groups attached to the same carbon in the product. If the product is 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne, then those two methyl groups are on C7. Let's imagine the structure:\n\nOct-3-yne: positions 1-8. The triple bond is between 3 and 4. If there are two methyl groups on C7, then the structure would be:\n\nCH2-CH2-CH2-C≡C-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. But that would be nine carbons, not eight. So it can't be oct-3-yne. \n\nWait, maybe the longest chain is shorter. Let's consider the product structure again: CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. Let's try to find the longest chain that includes the triple bond and the methyl groups.\n\nStarting from the triple bond, the longest chain could be:\n\nC≡C-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. That's five carbons on one side. On the other side of the triple bond is CH2. So total chain length is 5 +1 =6. But the triple bond is between two carbons. So the longest chain would be six carbons with the triple bond in the middle. Let's number from the left:\n\n1: CH2-\n\n2: C≡C-\n\n3: CH2-\n\n4: CH2-\n\n5: C(CH3)2-\n\n6: CH3\n\nBut this gives a triple bond between 2 and 3. The name would be 2,3-dimethylhex-2-yne. But this doesn't match any of the options. \n\nAlternatively, if we extend the chain to include more carbons. Let's see:\n\nThe structure is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. If we consider the CH2CH3 as part of the main chain, it might be longer. For example:\n\nCH2-C≡C-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH3. This is six carbons from the triple bond to the right. Adding the CH2 on the left makes seven. But the triple bond is between two carbons. \n\nThis is getting too complicated without drawing it out. Let's look at the NMR data for compound C: C10H18, with 5 signals: one singlet, three triplets, and one quartet. \n\nThe product has a structure derived from A and B. Let's consider the NMR of the product. If the product is 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne, what would its NMR look like? The two methyl groups on C7 would be a singlet (since they're attached to a carbon with no protons). The other protons would be in different environments, leading to triplets and quartets. \n\nAlternatively, if the product is 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne, the methyl groups on C6 and C7 would each be in different environments, leading to two separate signals. But the NMR data for C has only one singlet. So if there are two methyl groups on the same carbon (7,7-dimethyl), they would give one singlet. This matches the NMR data for C (one singlet). \n\nTherefore, the correct product is 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne, which corresponds to option C. \n\nOption C states: It is a nucleophilic substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne. This matches our analysis. \n\nLet's verify the other options. Option A says the product is 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne. This would have two methyl groups on different carbons, leading to two singlets or other signals, which doesn't match the one singlet in C's NMR. Option D involves a different structure with isopropyl and other methyl groups, which doesn't fit the molecular formula of C (C10H18). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>"}
