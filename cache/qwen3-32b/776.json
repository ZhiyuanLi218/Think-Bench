Let me start by recalling what I know about oxidation states and dichromate.\n\nFirst, the dichromate ion is Cr2O7^2-. I remember that in polyatomic ions, the sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms should equal the charge of the ion. So for dichromate, which has a charge of -2, the total oxidation states of all the chromium and oxygen atoms should add up to -2.\n\nNow, oxygen usually has an oxidation state of -2 in most compounds. There are exceptions, like in peroxides where it's -1, but in dichromate, I think it's the usual -2. Let me confirm that. Yes, in most oxides and oxyanions, oxygen is -2. So each oxygen in dichromate is -2. There are seven oxygen atoms, so that's 7 * (-2) = -14.\n\nThe formula is Cr2O7^2-, so there are two chromium atoms. Let me call the oxidation state of each chromium atom \"x\". Then the total oxidation states from chromium would be 2x. Adding the oxygen's contribution, the total is 2x + (-14) = charge of the ion, which is -2. So:\n\n2x - 14 = -2\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = -2 + 14 = 12\n\nx = 12 / 2 = 6\n\nSo each chromium in dichromate has an oxidation state of +6. That would make the oxidation state of chromium in dichromate +6. So the first part of the question is asking for that oxidation state, which is +6.\n\nNow, the second part is whether reduction or oxidation occurs when dichromate forms Cr3+. Let me recall that oxidation is an increase in oxidation state, and reduction is a decrease. So if the oxidation state goes down, it's reduction; if it goes up, it's oxidation.\n\nIn dichromate, chromium is +6. When it forms Cr3+, the oxidation state is +3. So from +6 to +3, that's a decrease. Therefore, it's a reduction. So the process is reduction.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA: 3+, reduction – no, the oxidation state in dichromate is +6, not +3.\n\nB: 12+, reduction – no, that would be if each chromium was +12, but we calculated +6.\n\nC: 6+, reduction – yes, oxidation state is +6 and reduction occurs.\n\nD: 6+, oxidation – no, because oxidation would be if the oxidation state increased, but here it decreases.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C: 6+, reduction.\n\nWait, just to double-check. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The dichromate ion is Cr2O7^2-. Each Cr is +6. When it becomes Cr^3+, that's lower oxidation state, so reduction. Yes, that makes sense. Reduction is gain of electrons, which would lower the oxidation state. So dichromate is being reduced to Cr^3+.\n\nAnother way to think about it: in a redox reaction, the oxidizing agent is reduced. Dichromate is a common oxidizing agent, so when it reacts, it gets reduced. That aligns with this scenario. So yes, reduction is happening here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 6+, reduction.\n</think>"}
