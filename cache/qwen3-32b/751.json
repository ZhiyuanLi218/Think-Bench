The constraints are that x is at least 2 and y is at least 5. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the deck has 54 cards. When dealing all the cards to x players, each player gets y cards. So, the total number of cards dealt should be equal to the number of players multiplied by the number of cards each player gets. That is:\n\nx * y = 54\n\nSo, x and y are positive integers that multiply to 54. But there are constraints: x ≥ 2 and y ≥ 5. Therefore, I need to find all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x * y = 54, x ≥ 2, and y ≥ 5. Then, count the number of distinct x values that satisfy these conditions.\n\nFirst, let me recall that 54 can be factored into integers in several ways. Let me list all the positive integer factors of 54. To do that, I can start by prime factorizing 54.\n\n54 divided by 2 is 27. Then 27 is 3 cubed. So, prime factors are 2 * 3^3.\n\nThe number of divisors is (1 + 1)(3 + 1) = 8. So there are 8 positive divisors. Let me list them:\n\nStarting from 1:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nSo these are all the positive integers that divide 54. Each of these numbers can be paired with another to multiply to 54. For example, 1 * 54, 2 * 27, 3 * 18, 6 * 9, and then the reverse pairs: 54 * 1, 27 * 2, etc. But since x and y are just variables, the order might not matter here, but since we have constraints on x and y, I need to check each possible pair.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem states that all cards are dealt to x players, so x must be a divisor of 54. Therefore, x must be one of the divisors listed above: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. But x has to be at least 2, so we can eliminate 1. Therefore, possible x values are 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. However, we also have the constraint that y must be at least 5. Since y = 54 / x, we need to ensure that 54 / x ≥ 5. Therefore, solving for x:\n\n54 / x ≥ 5 => x ≤ 54 / 5 => x ≤ 10.8\n\nSince x must be an integer, x ≤ 10. Therefore, x has to be a divisor of 54, at least 2, and at most 10. So let me check which of the possible x values (from the list above) are between 2 and 10 inclusive.\n\nOriginal list after removing 1: 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nNow, numbers in this list that are ≤ 10: 2, 3, 6, 9. The next one is 18, which is 18, which is more than 10.8, so 18 is too big, same with 27 and 54. Therefore, possible x values are 2, 3, 6, 9. Let me check for each of these whether y is at least 5.\n\nFor x=2: y=54/2=27 ≥5 ✔️\n\nFor x=3: y=54/3=18 ≥5 ✔️\n\nFor x=6: y=54/6=9 ≥5 ✔️\n\nFor x=9: y=54/9=6 ≥5 ✔️\n\nSo all four of these x values satisfy the constraints. Therefore, there are 4 possible values of x. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any divisors between 2 and 10.\n\nOriginal divisors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. Are there any other divisors between 2 and 10? Let's check 4, 5, 7, 8, 10.\n\nDoes 4 divide 54? 54 divided by 4 is 13.5, which is not integer. So no.\n\nDoes 5 divide 54? 54 / 5 is 10.8, not integer.\n\nDoes 7 divide 54? 54 / 7 ≈ 7.7, not integer.\n\nDoes 8 divide 54? 54 / 8 = 6.75, nope.\n\nDoes 10 divide 54? 54 / 10 = 5.4, nope. So the only divisors between 2 and 10 are 2, 3, 6, 9. Therefore, four values.\n\nWait, but let me check again if my reasoning for x ≤ 10.8 is correct. Because if x must satisfy y ≥ 5, then since y = 54/x, then 54/x ≥ 5 => x ≤ 54/5 = 10.8. Therefore, x must be less than or equal to 10.8. Since x is integer, maximum x is 10. Therefore, x can be up to 10. However, x must divide 54. So even if there was a divisor at 10, but 10 doesn't divide 54, so the maximum x is 9. So yes, the possible x's are 2, 3, 6, 9. Therefore, 4 possible values.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose x is allowed to be higher than 10.8, but y would be less than 5. However, the problem says y must be at least 5. Therefore, x cannot be higher than 10.8, so only up to 10. But since x must divide 54, and the divisors above 10 are 18, 27, 54. Let me check for those:\n\nx=18: y=54/18=3, which is less than 5, so invalid.\n\nx=27: y=54/27=2, invalid.\n\nx=54: y=1, invalid.\n\nTherefore, they are invalid. So indeed, only 2, 3, 6, 9.\n\nWait, but hold on. What if there is a case where x is greater than 10.8 but y is still ≥5? For example, suppose x=10, but 54 isn't divisible by 10. If x was, say, 9, which is less than 10.8, then y is 6. If x was 10, which is more than 9 but less than 10.8, but since 54 isn't divisible by 10, there is no such x. Therefore, there are no other divisors. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the divisors?\n\nDivisors of 54:\n\nStart with 1 and 54.\n\nThen 2 and 27.\n\nThen 3 and 18.\n\nThen 6 and 9.\n\nThat's it, because after 6, the next factor would be 9, which we already have. So yes, only those 8 divisors. So the ones between 2 and 10 are 2, 3, 6, 9. Therefore, four values.\n\nBut let me think again if there is another approach. For example, solving for x and y.\n\nGiven x ≥ 2, y ≥ 5, and x * y = 54. So x can be any integer divisor of 54 such that x ≥ 2 and 54/x ≥ 5. So 54/x ≥ 5 => x ≤ 54/5 = 10.8. So x is in [2, 10.8]. Since x is integer, x ∈ {2, 3, ..., 10}. Now check which of these integers divide 54. As above, 2, 3, 6, 9. Therefore, four values. So answer is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of possible y's. Since y ≥ 5 and x ≥ 2, and x = 54 / y. Since x must be integer ≥ 2, then y must divide 54, and 54 / y ≥ 2 => y ≤ 54 / 2 = 27. So y ∈ [5, 27], and y divides 54. Let's see what possible y's there are. Then for each valid y, x is determined as 54 / y, and we can count unique x's.\n\nSo divisors of 54 that are between 5 and 27 inclusive. Let's list divisors of 54 again:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nDivisors between 5 and 27 inclusive: 6, 9, 18, 27.\n\nTherefore, for each of these y's:\n\nIf y=6, then x=54/6=9.\n\nIf y=9, x=54/9=6.\n\nIf y=18, x=54/18=3.\n\nIf y=27, x=54/27=2.\n\nTherefore, the corresponding x's are 9, 6, 3, 2. Which are the same as before. Therefore, four x's. Therefore, same answer. So regardless of whether I approach it from x or y, I get 4. Therefore, seems like 4 is the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there are other divisors between 5 and 27. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. Between 5 and 27 inclusive, we have 6, 9, 18, 27. What about 5? Is 5 a divisor? 54 divided by 5 is 10.8, which is not integer, so 5 is not a divisor. Similarly, 7? No. 8? No. 10? No. 12? No. So only those four. Therefore, yes, four values. So answer is 4.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and maybe get a different answer. For example, if someone thought that x could be any integer as long as y is integer, not necessarily that x divides 54? But no, because if you have x players each getting y cards, then x*y must equal 54. Therefore, x must divide 54. Therefore, only divisors. So that approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that maybe you can have multiple deals where players get different numbers of cards, but the problem says \"each player getting y cards\". So it's a deal where all players get the same number of cards. Therefore, x must divide 54. Therefore, the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 4. But let me check once more with actual numbers:\n\nFor x=2, y=27: 2 players each get 27 cards. Valid.\n\nx=3, y=18: 3 players get 18 each. Valid.\n\nx=6, y=9: 6 players get 9 each. Valid.\n\nx=9, y=6: 9 players get 6 each. Valid.\n\nThese are all valid. Any others? For example, if x= something else?\n\nIf x=4, y=54/4=13.5: Not integer, invalid.\n\nx=5: 54/5=10.8, invalid.\n\nx=7: 54/7≈7.71, invalid.\n\nx=8: 54/8=6.75, invalid.\n\nx=10: 54/10=5.4, invalid.\n\nSo none of these work. Therefore, only four x's. Therefore, answer is 4. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\nBut let me check once more if there's a possible misunderstanding in the problem. For example, the deck has 54 cards. Maybe when dealing, there is a possibility of remainder? But the problem says \"I deal all of the cards to x players, with each player getting y cards.\" Therefore, it must be that all cards are dealt, so there is no remainder. Therefore, x must divide 54. Therefore, my reasoning is correct.\n\nAnother possible misunderstanding: maybe the problem is in Chinese, and the translation is \"deal all of the cards to x players, with each player getting y cards.\" Maybe there is some other interpretation? But no, in standard card game terms, dealing all the cards equally would require that the number of players divides the number of cards. So, I think the reasoning is solid.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible x is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4. So in boxed notation, \\boxed{4}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of possible values of $ x $ is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>"}
