So, there's a charged particle moving in a space with both a uniform magnetic field and a uniform electric field. Initially, when both are present, the particle moves with uniform linear motion, meaning it's moving in a straight line at a constant speed. Then, if we remove the electric field, the particle moves in uniform circular motion. The question is asking which of the factors listed (A to D) is unrelated to accomplishing these two types of motion.\n\nFirst, let me recall the basic concepts. When a charged particle is moving in electric and magnetic fields, the force acting on it is given by the Lorentz force: F = q(E + v × B). So, the total force is the sum of the electric force qE and the magnetic force q(v × B).\n\nIn the first scenario, when the particle is moving in uniform linear motion, that means the net force on it must be zero. Because if the net force is zero, the particle will move with constant velocity (Newton's first law). So, for that to happen, the electric force must exactly cancel the magnetic force. Therefore, qE + q(v × B) = 0. Dividing both sides by q (assuming q ≠ 0), we get E + v × B = 0. Therefore, E = -v × B. This implies that the electric field must be exactly balancing the magnetic force. So, the direction and magnitude of E and B must be such that this equation holds. \n\nSo, in this case, the direction of the magnetic and electric fields (option A) is important because they need to be oriented in such a way that E is opposite to v × B. Similarly, the strength of the fields (option B) must be such that E equals v × B in magnitude. The charge of the particle (option C) seems to not matter here because it cancels out in the equation. Wait, but if the charge is positive or negative, wouldn't that affect the direction of the forces? Wait, but in the equation E + v × B = 0, the charge cancels out. So regardless of the sign of the charge, the condition is the same. So, the charge nature (sign) and quantity (magnitude) would not affect this condition? Because even if q is positive or negative, when you set the net force to zero, the equation becomes E = -v × B regardless of q. However, if the charge is zero, then the particle wouldn't be affected, but the problem states it's a charged particle, so q ≠ 0. So, maybe the charge's nature and quantity are not related here? But wait, if the charge was different, would that affect the velocity? Hmm, no, because the condition is independent of q. So, for the first motion (uniform linear), the charge's nature and quantity (C) are not related? But then in the second scenario, when the electric field is removed, the particle moves in uniform circular motion. Let's think about that.\n\nWhen the electric field is removed, the only force is the magnetic force, which is q(v × B). For circular motion, the magnetic force provides the centripetal force. So, the magnitude of the force is qvB = mv² / r, where m is the mass of the particle and r is the radius of the circular path. So, solving for r, we get r = mv / (qB). Here, the radius depends on the mass and velocity of the particle, the charge, and the magnetic field strength. However, the problem says \"uniform circular motion,\" which implies that the speed is constant (since it's uniform), but the direction changes. Wait, actually, in uniform circular motion, the speed is constant, so the kinetic energy is constant. The magnetic force does no work because it's perpendicular to the velocity. So, in this case, the radius depends on the mass, velocity, charge, and magnetic field strength.\n\nBut the question is about which factors are unrelated to accomplishing the two types of motion. The two scenarios are: 1) uniform linear motion with both fields present, and 2) uniform circular motion with only the magnetic field.\n\nNow, let's check each option:\n\nOption A: The direction of the magnetic and electric fields. In the first case, the direction is crucial because E must be opposite to v × B. In the second case, the direction of B determines the plane of the circular motion. So direction is related. Therefore, A is related.\n\nOption B: The strength of the magnetic and electric fields. In the first case, E must equal v × B in magnitude. So the strength of E and B must be such that E = vB (assuming v is perpendicular to B, but maybe more generally, the magnitude of E equals vB sin(theta), where theta is the angle between v and B). So the strength of the fields is important. In the second case, the strength of B affects the radius of the circular motion. So B is related.\n\nOption C: The charge nature and quantity of the particle. In the first case, as we saw, the equation E = -v × B is independent of the charge. So regardless of the charge's sign or magnitude, as long as it's non-zero, the condition holds. However, in the second case, when the electric field is removed, the radius of the circular motion depends on q. If the charge was different, the radius would be different. However, the problem states that the particle \"moves in uniform circular motion,\" but doesn't specify any particular radius. So as long as the magnetic field is present, the particle will move in a circle, with a radius determined by its mass, velocity, charge, and B. Therefore, the fact that it can move in circular motion when E is removed is possible regardless of the charge (as long as it's non-zero). Therefore, the charge's nature (sign) would affect the direction of the circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise), but the problem doesn't specify any direction for the circular motion, just that it's uniform circular motion. So maybe the charge's nature and quantity are not unrelated? Wait, but in the first scenario, the charge's quantity (magnitude) cancels out. In the second scenario, the charge affects the radius. However, the problem is about accomplishing the two types of motion. So, if the charge was different, would that prevent the motion? No, the motion can still occur, just with a different radius. Therefore, the charge is related to the second motion (circular) in terms of the radius, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the radius. Therefore, maybe the charge's nature and quantity is not unrelated? Wait, but the question is asking which factor is unrelated. So if the charge's nature and quantity don't affect the possibility of the motions occurring (i.e., as long as there's a charge, the motions can occur, with appropriate parameters), then maybe C is unrelated? Wait, but in the first case, the charge must be non-zero, but the problem says it's a charged particle. So the charge's existence is given, but the question is about the nature (sign) and quantity (magnitude). So, for example, if the charge was double, would that affect whether the motion is possible? In the first case, no, because the condition E = -v × B is independent of q. In the second case, the radius would be different, but the particle still undergoes circular motion. Therefore, the fact that the particle can undergo these two motions doesn't depend on the charge's magnitude or sign. Therefore, option C is unrelated? But wait, the problem says \"neglecting gravity,\" so we don't have to consider that. Therefore, perhaps option C is unrelated. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the charge's nature (sign) affects the direction of the velocity required for the first scenario. For example, if the charge is positive or negative, the direction of the magnetic force would be opposite. However, since in the first scenario, the electric force must cancel the magnetic force, the direction of E would have to be adjusted accordingly. But the problem states that the fields are given (they exist in the space), so maybe the direction of E and B are already set such that for a particular charge, the forces cancel. Wait, but the question says that the particle enters with a certain initial velocity and moves in uniform linear motion. So the setup of the fields must be such that for that particular particle's charge and velocity, E cancels the magnetic force. Therefore, if the charge was different, the same fields might not cancel the forces. Wait, but the problem states that the fields are fixed. The question is about factors related to accomplishing the two types of motion. So if the charge is different, then in order to have uniform linear motion, the fields would need to be adjusted. But the problem says that the fields are already present. Therefore, if the charge of the particle is different, it might not move in uniform linear motion unless the velocity is adjusted. Therefore, the charge's nature and quantity are related to the first motion. Because if you have a different charge, you might need a different velocity to satisfy E = -v × B. Wait, but in the problem statement, the particle enters with a certain initial velocity. So if the charge is different, then the initial velocity would need to be different to satisfy E = -v × B. Therefore, if the charge is different, but the velocity is kept the same, then the motion wouldn't be uniform linear. Therefore, the charge's nature and quantity are related to the accomplishment of the motion. Therefore, option C is related. Therefore, maybe my previous thought that it's unrelated is wrong.\n\nWait, the question is asking which factor is UNRELATED. So if the charge is different, but we can adjust the velocity accordingly, then the motion can still be accomplished. However, the problem states that the particle enters with a certain initial velocity. So the setup is that for the given charge and velocity, the fields are set so that E = -v × B. Therefore, if the charge was different, with the same velocity and same fields, the equation wouldn't hold. Therefore, the charge is a factor. Therefore, option C is related. Therefore, maybe the answer is not C.\n\nLet me consider option D: the velocity of the particle upon entry. In the first case, the velocity must be such that E = -v × B. So the velocity is directly related. In the second case, when the electric field is removed, the velocity determines the radius of the circular motion. Therefore, the velocity is related to both motions. Therefore, D is related. Therefore, if all options A, B, C, D are related, then there's a mistake. But the question says one of them is unrelated. So where is my mistake?\n\nWait, let me re-express the equations.\n\nFirst case: E + v × B = 0. So E = -v × B. This equation must hold. So, the direction of E and B must be such that this cross product holds. The strength of E and B must satisfy |E| = vB sin(theta), where theta is the angle between v and B. The charge's magnitude and sign cancel out, so they don't affect this condition. However, the velocity must be such that this equation holds. Therefore, the velocity is related. So if the velocity is different, then the fields would need to be adjusted. But in the problem, the fields are fixed. Therefore, the velocity must be chosen appropriately. Since the particle enters with a certain velocity, that velocity is part of the condition. So D is related.\n\nNow, option C: the charge's nature and quantity. Since in the first equation, the charge cancels out, so regardless of the charge (as long as it's non-zero), the same velocity and fields would allow uniform motion. Wait, no. Wait, if the charge is different, but the velocity and fields are the same, then the equation qE + q(v × B) = 0 would still hold because it's q*(E + v × B) = 0. But since E + v × B = 0 already, then regardless of q, the net force is zero. Wait, that's a different way to look at it. So if E + v × B = 0, then the net force is zero for any charge. Therefore, if the fields are set such that E + v × B = 0, then any charged particle moving with velocity v would experience zero net force. Therefore, the charge's nature and quantity are not related to the accomplishment of the first motion. Because regardless of what the charge is (as long as it's non-zero), if the fields are set correctly, the motion is uniform. Therefore, option C is unrelated? But then in the second case, when the electric field is removed, the motion becomes circular. The radius depends on the charge. But the problem doesn't specify any particular radius, just that it moves in uniform circular motion. So as long as there's a magnetic field, any charged particle will move in a circle (assuming velocity is perpendicular to B). Therefore, the fact that it can move in circular motion is independent of the charge's nature and quantity. Wait, but the radius depends on it. However, the problem doesn't specify that the radius has to be a certain value. It just says it moves in uniform circular motion, which it will do regardless of the charge (as long as there's a charge). Therefore, in terms of the possibility of the motion occurring, the charge's nature and quantity are not a factor. Therefore, option C is unrelated. But earlier I thought that if the charge was different, you might need a different velocity. Wait, but in the first case, the velocity is already set such that E + v × B = 0. In the second case, the velocity is the same as in the first case, right? Because when you remove the electric field, the particle continues with the same velocity (since previously the net force was zero, so velocity was constant). So when you remove E, the particle is moving with velocity v, and then the magnetic force causes circular motion. The radius depends on v, q, B. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on the radius. So as long as the magnetic field is present, the particle will move in a circle. Therefore, the charge's nature and quantity don't affect the possibility of the circular motion. Therefore, option C is unrelated to accomplishing both motions. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut earlier I thought that maybe the charge's sign would affect the direction of the circular motion. For example, a positive charge would go clockwise, and a negative counterclockwise. But the problem doesn't specify the direction of the circular motion, just that it's uniform. So as long as it's circular, regardless of direction, it's acceptable. Therefore, the charge's nature (sign) is not a factor in the accomplishment of the motion, just the direction of the motion. Since the problem doesn't specify direction, it's acceptable. Therefore, option C is unrelated. \n\nSo the answer should be option C. Let me check again the options:\n\n(A) direction of fields – related, because they need to be oriented properly.\n\n(B) strength of fields – related, because E and B must have specific magnitudes.\n\n(C) charge nature and quantity – unrelated, because they cancel out in the first condition and don't prevent the second motion.\n\n(D) velocity – related, because velocity must satisfy E = -v × B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
