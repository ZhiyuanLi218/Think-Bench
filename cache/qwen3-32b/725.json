Let's analyze each option systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Option A: No preservatives can be added during food processing**  \nThis statement is **incorrect**. While excessive or improper use of preservatives can be harmful, certain preservatives (e.g., sodium benzoate, ascorbic acid) are approved and regulated for use in food processing. They help prevent microbial growth, spoilage, and maintain food safety. The statement's absolute nature (\"no preservatives\") is unrealistic and false.\n\n---\n\n**Option B: Burying used batteries will not cause environmental pollution**  \nThis statement is **incorrect**. Used batteries contain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and mercury. When buried, these metals can leach into the soil and groundwater, contaminating ecosystems and posing serious health risks. Proper disposal and recycling of batteries are essential to prevent environmental harm.\n\n---\n\n**Option C: Incomplete combustion of natural gas will produce toxic gases**  \nThis statement is **correct**. Natural gas is primarily methane (CH₄). Complete combustion produces carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O), which are relatively non-toxic. However, incomplete combustion—due to insufficient oxygen—results in the formation of **carbon monoxide (CO)**, a highly toxic gas. CO can cause severe health issues, including suffocation and death at high concentrations.\n\n---\n\n**Option D: Using phosphorus-containing detergents will not cause water pollution**  \nThis statement is **incorrect**. Phosphorus in detergents contributes to **eutrophication**, a process where excess nutrients (like phosphates) in water bodies lead to algal blooms. These blooms deplete oxygen in the water, harming aquatic life and disrupting ecosystems. Many countries have restricted or banned phosphorus-containing detergents to mitigate this environmental issue.\n\n---\n\n**Correct Answer:**  \n**(C) Incomplete combustion of natural gas will produce toxic gases.**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about chemistry and its relation to human health and environmental protection. The options are A to D, and I need to determine which statements are correct.\n\nFirst, let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: No preservatives can be added during food processing. Hmm. I know that preservatives are commonly used in food to prevent spoilage and extend shelf life. For example, sodium benzoate or potassium sorbate are common preservatives. However, there are regulations about their use. The statement says \"no preservatives can be added,\" which sounds too absolute. In reality, certain preservatives are allowed in specific amounts. So A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B: Burying used batteries will not cause environmental pollution. Wait, batteries contain heavy metals like lead, cadmium, or mercury. If you bury them, these metals can leach into the soil and groundwater, causing pollution. I remember that proper disposal of batteries is important because of this. So B is incorrect because burying them would cause pollution.\n\nOption C: Incomplete combustion of natural gas will produce toxic gases. Natural gas is primarily methane (CH4). Complete combustion produces CO2 and H2O. But incomplete combustion happens when there's not enough oxygen, leading to the formation of carbon monoxide (CO), which is toxic. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: Using phosphorus-containing detergents will not cause water pollution. Phosphates in detergents can lead to eutrophication in water bodies. They cause algal blooms, which deplete oxygen and harm aquatic life. I think many countries have banned phosphorus-containing detergents for this reason. So D is incorrect because they do cause water pollution.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>"}
