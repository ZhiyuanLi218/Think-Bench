I need to figure out which of the options A to D are correct based on the given nuclear reactions and the information provided. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the question is about the artificial synthesis of two oxygen isotopes, O-13 and O-15, which have very short half-lives and can't exist stably in nature. The reactions given are:\n\n1. O-16 (oxygen-16) + He-3 (helium-3) → O-13 + X\n2. O-16 + He-3 → O-15 + Y\n\nWe need to determine what X and Y are, and then evaluate the options based on that. Let me start by analyzing the nuclear reactions to find out what X and Y are.\n\nIn nuclear reactions, both the mass number (superscript) and the atomic number (subscript) must balance on both sides of the equation. So for each reaction, I can set up equations for the mass numbers and atomic numbers.\n\nStarting with the first reaction:\n\nO-16 has a mass number of 16 and atomic number 8 (since it's oxygen, element 8). He-3 has a mass number of 3 and atomic number 2. The product is O-13, which has a mass number of 13 and atomic number 8, and X, which we need to find.\n\nSo, for the mass numbers:\n\n16 (from O-16) + 3 (from He-3) = 13 (from O-13) + a (from X)\n\nTherefore, 19 = 13 + a → a = 19 - 13 = 6.\n\nFor the atomic numbers:\n\n8 (O-16) + 2 (He-3) = 8 (O-13) + b (from X)\n\nSo, 10 = 8 + b → b = 10 - 8 = 2.\n\nSo X has a mass number of 6 and atomic number of 2. The element with atomic number 2 is helium (He). So X is helium-6, which would be written as He-6, or in the given notation, ₂⁶He. Wait, the problem writes X as X with a subscript b and superscript a. So since b is 2 and a is 6, X is He-6. Now, the neutron number of X would be mass number minus atomic number, which is 6 - 2 = 4. But option A says the neutron number is 2. Hmm, so maybe option A is incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\nMass number of X is 6, atomic number is 2. So neutron number is 6 - 2 = 4. So option A says neutron number is 2. So A is incorrect. Therefore, A is not correct. So if option A is wrong, that's one thing to note.\n\nNow moving to the second reaction:\n\nO-16 + He-3 → O-15 + Y.\n\nAgain, balancing mass numbers:\n\n16 + 3 = 15 + m → 19 = 15 + m → m = 4.\n\nAtomic numbers:\n\n8 + 2 = 8 + n → 10 = 8 + n → n = 2.\n\nTherefore, Y has mass number 4 and atomic number 2, which is helium-4. So Y is He-4. So X is He-6 and Y is He-4. Now, are X and Y isotopes of each other? Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same atomic number) with different mass numbers. Since both X and Y have atomic number 2 (helium), but different mass numbers (6 and 4), they are isotopes. Therefore, option B is correct. So B is correct.\n\nNow, moving to option C: O-13 and O-15 can be used as tracer atoms to study chemical reaction processes. Tracer atoms are used because they can be detected due to their radioactivity, allowing scientists to track their path in reactions. Since O-13 and O-15 are radioactive isotopes (given their short half-lives), they can indeed be used as tracers. Even though they don't exist naturally, they can be synthesized and introduced into reactions for tracking. So option C is correct. \n\nOption D: The absence of O-13 O2 and O-15 O2 molecules in nature is due to the instability of their chemical bonds. Wait, but the problem states that the half-lives of O-13 and O-15 are very short, meaning they decay quickly before they could form molecules. So the reason they don't exist in nature isn't because their chemical bonds are unstable, but because the isotopes themselves are unstable and decay rapidly. Therefore, the absence is due to the instability of the isotopes themselves, not their chemical bonds. So option D is incorrect. \n\nSo the correct options are B and C. Let me check again.\n\nOption A: Neutron number of X is 2. X is He-6. Neutrons = 6 - 2 = 4. So A is wrong. \n\nOption B: X (He-6) and Y (He-4) are isotopes. Yes, same element, different mass numbers. Correct.\n\nOption C: Tracer atoms. Yes, because radioactive tracers are used. Correct.\n\nOption D: Incorrect, because the issue is the instability of the isotopes, not their chemical bonds. \n\nSo the correct answers should be B and C. But let me check the options again. The options are (A) ... (B) ... (C) ... (D) ... So the correct statements are B and C. But let me check if the problem allows multiple correct options. The question says \"The correct statements are: Options: (A)... etc.\" So in Chinese exams, sometimes multiple options can be correct. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem is presented in Chinese, but here translated. The options are A, B, C, D. The user hasn't specified if it's multiple choice or single choice. But in the original problem, probably multiple can be correct. So according to my analysis, B and C are correct. Let me check again.\n\nFor option C: \"can be used as tracer atoms to study the chemical reaction process.\" Tracer atoms are typically radioactive isotopes because their radioactivity allows detection. Since O-13 and O-15 have short half-lives, they can be used as tracers, even though they don't exist naturally. So yes, C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C. However, looking back at the problem, the options are given as (A), (B), (C), (D). So the user is probably expecting to select all that apply. But let me check again if there's any mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAnother thing to check: For the first reaction, O-16 + He-3 → O-13 + X. O-16 has 8 protons, He-3 has 2 protons. The total protons are 10. On the right, O-13 has 8 protons, so X must have 2 protons, which is helium. The mass numbers: 16 + 3 = 19. O-13 is 13, so X is 6. So X is He-6. Correct. Neutron number is 6 - 2 = 4. So A is wrong.\n\nY is He-4. So X and Y are isotopes. Correct. So B is correct. \n\nSo yes, B and C are correct. Let me check if the options are presented as multiple select. If the original question allows multiple correct answers, then B and C. But let me check the options again.\n\nThe options given are:\n\n(A) Neutron number of X is 2 (incorrect)\n\n(B) X and Y are isotopes (correct)\n\n(C) O-13 and O-15 can be used as tracers (correct)\n\n(D) Absence of O13 O2 and O15 O2 is due to instability of chemical bonds (incorrect, because it's the isotopes that are unstable, not the bonds)\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C. However, looking back at the problem statement, the way the options are presented might indicate that in the original problem, the answer is a combination. But since the user hasn't specified if it's multiple choice, but in many cases, such questions in exams can have multiple correct answers. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible mistake. For example, maybe the question is in Chinese and the translation might have nuances. Let me check option C again. The statement says that O-13 and O-15 can be used as tracer atoms. Since they are radioactive, they can be used as tracers in chemical reactions. Even though they don't exist in nature, they can be synthesized and introduced. So yes, C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C. However, in some cases, maybe the options are given as (B) and (C), but the user might have to select them. Since the user is asking for the correct statements among the options, the answer should include B and C. However, looking back, the original problem may have different intended answers. Let me check once more.\n\nIs there a possibility that option C is incorrect? For example, if the half-life is too short, maybe they can't be used as tracers? Well, it depends on the half-life's length. If they decay quickly enough that they can't be used, but the problem states that they are synthesized artificially, so presumably they can be used in reactions before decaying. For example, many radioactive tracers have short half-lives but are still useful if the reaction they are tracking is fast enough. So C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C. However, looking at the options given, if the original problem is from a specific source, maybe there's a different answer. But based on my analysis, B and C are correct. Let me check if the options are labeled as multiple correct. In some cases, the options might be presented as multiple choice letters, like BC or something. Since the user hasn't specified, but in the problem statement it's presented as options A to D, and the user is to provide the correct ones, I think the answer is B and C.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other aspect. For example, option D: the absence is due to instability of chemical bonds. If O-13 and O-15 could form O2 molecules, but the molecules don't exist because the bonds are unstable. However, the real reason is that the isotopes themselves decay before they can form molecules or before the molecules can exist. So D is incorrect. Hence, D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C. However, if the options are presented as separate, and the user is to select all that apply, then B and C. But let me check the original problem's options again. The options are (A), (B), (C), (D). The user might have to select multiple. Therefore, the correct answer is B and C.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, in Chinese exams, sometimes the options are designed to have only one correct answer, but in this case, both B and C seem correct. Let me check once more.\n\nOption B: X and Y are isotopes. Since X is He-6 and Y is He-4, yes, they are isotopes. Correct.\n\nOption C: Tracer atoms. Yes. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B and C. However, looking at the initial problem statement, maybe the options are presented in a way where only one is correct? Let me check if there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAnother angle: For option C, the question says \"can be used as tracer atoms to study the chemical reaction process\". Tracer atoms are typically stable isotopes, but radioactive ones can also be used. However, since O-13 and O-15 are radioactive, they can be used as radioactive tracers. So yes, C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C. Hence, if the options are multiple select, then B and C. However, in some cases, maybe the options are presented as a combination. Since the user hasn't specified, but given the way the problem is presented, I think B and C are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe correct statements are \\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>"}
