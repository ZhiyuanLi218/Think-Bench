Hmm, let me think. First, maybe I can simplify both sides so they have the same base? Because if I can write both sides as powers of 2, then I can set the exponents equal to each other. That usually works with exponential equations. \n\nAlright, the left side is already 2^{2x}, which is good. The right side is 256^(1/2). I know that 256 is a power of 2. Let me recall... 2^8 is 256, right? Let me check: 2^10 is 1024, so 2^8 should be 256. Yeah, 2^8 = 256. So maybe I can rewrite 256 as 2^8. Let me try that.\n\nSo replacing 256 with 2^8, the equation becomes 2^{2x} = (2^8)^(1/2). Now, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So that would be 2^(8*(1/2)). Let me compute that exponent: 8 times 1/2 is 4. So the right side simplifies to 2^4. \n\nNow the equation is 2^{2x} = 2^4. Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. That means 2x = 4. To solve for x, I just divide both sides by 2. So x = 4/2, which is 2. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. First, I converted 256 to 2^8. Then I applied the exponent 1/2, which gave me 2^4. Then set 2x equal to 4. Yeah, that seems right. Let me verify by plugging x = 2 back into the original equation. \n\nLeft side: 2^{2*2} = 2^4 = 16. Right side: 256^(1/2) is the square root of 256, which is 16. Both sides equal 16, so it checks out. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my exponent rules. For example, when I have (a^m)^n, it's a^{m*n}, right? So (2^8)^{1/2} is 2^{8*(1/2)} which is 2^4. Yep, that's correct. And 2^{2x} equals 2^4 implies 2x = 4. Definitely. \n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe taking logarithms? Let me try that method to confirm. \n\nStarting with the original equation: 2^{2x} = 256^{1/2}. Take the natural logarithm of both sides. \n\nln(2^{2x}) = ln(256^{1/2})\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, which says ln(a^b) = b*ln(a), so:\n\n2x * ln(2) = (1/2) * ln(256)\n\nThen solve for x:\n\nx = [ (1/2) * ln(256) ] / [ 2 * ln(2) ] = [ ln(256) ] / [4 * ln(2) ]\n\nNow, let me compute that. Since ln(256) is ln(2^8) which is 8*ln(2). Therefore:\n\nx = [8 * ln(2)] / [4 * ln(2)] = 8/4 = 2. \n\nSame answer. So that confirms it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of 256^(1/2) as sqrt(256). Which is 16, as I thought earlier. Then the equation becomes 2^{2x} = 16. Since 16 is also a power of 2. 2^4 is 16. So again, 2^{2x} = 2^4 => 2x = 4 => x = 2. \n\nSo all methods lead to x = 2. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, what if someone tried to solve it without recognizing 256 as 2^8? Maybe they would convert both sides to base 10 or something? But that would be more complicated. Let me try that approach too, just to see. \n\nOriginal equation: 2^{2x} = 256^{1/2}\n\nTake logarithms, maybe base 10. \n\nlog(2^{2x}) = log(256^{1/2})\n\nAgain, using power rule:\n\n2x * log(2) = (1/2) * log(256)\n\nThen x = [ (1/2) * log(256) ] / [ 2 * log(2) ] = log(256^{1/2}) / [ 2 * log(2) ] \n\nBut 256^{1/2} is 16, so:\n\nx = log(16) / [ 2 * log(2) ]\n\nSince 16 is 2^4, log(16) = log(2^4) = 4 * log(2). Therefore:\n\nx = 4 * log(2) / [ 2 * log(2) ] = 4/2 = 2. \n\nSame result. So regardless of the logarithm base, it cancels out. \n\nTherefore, x is definitely 2. \n\nI think that's thorough. Maybe another way? Let me think. If someone didn't remember that 2^8 is 256, they might calculate 2^10 is 1024, so 2^8 is 2^10 / 2^2 = 1024 / 4 = 256. So that's how they can figure out that 2^8 is 256. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they can compute sqrt(256). Since sqrt(256) is 16, and then solve 2^{2x} = 16. Since 16 is 2^4, same as before. \n\nSo even if you don't remember exponents of 2, you can compute square roots or use logarithms. \n\nBut in any case, all roads lead to x = 2. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap:\n\nOriginal equation: 2^{2x} = sqrt(256)\n\nSimplify sqrt(256) = 16.\n\nSo 2^{2x} = 16.\n\nBut 16 is 2^4, so 2^{2x} = 2^4 => 2x = 4 => x = 2. \n\nYep. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even more basic. Let me think. Suppose someone doesn't know exponents well. Let me try to solve 2^{2x} = 16 by trial and error. \n\nIf x = 1, 2^{2*1} = 4. Not 16. \n\nx = 2, 2^4 = 16. Bingo. \n\nx = 3, 2^6 = 64. Too big. So x=2 is the answer. \n\nSo even trial and error works here. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that x=2 is the correct solution. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and multiple methods confirm the same answer. So I think that's it. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>"}
