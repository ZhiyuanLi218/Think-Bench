Hmm, roots of unity... that means solutions to zⁿ = 1, right? So if all roots of this polynomial are nth roots of unity, then each root raised to the nth power should equal 1. And n has to be the smallest such integer. \n\nFirst, maybe I should try to find the roots of z⁴ + z² + 1 = 0. Let me see if I can factor this equation or relate it to something I know. The equation is a quartic, but maybe I can make a substitution. Let me set w = z². Then the equation becomes w² + w + 1 = 0. \n\nSolving for w, using quadratic formula: w = [-1 ± sqrt(1 - 4)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(-3)] / 2. So w = [-1 ± i√3]/2. Therefore, z² = [-1 ± i√3]/2. \n\nNow I need to find z such that z² equals those values. Let me recall that complex numbers can be expressed in polar form. The roots of unity are often easier to handle in polar form. Let me try converting these w values to polar form. \n\nFirst, let me consider w = [-1 + i√3]/2. The modulus of this complex number is sqrt[ (-1/2)² + (√3/2)² ] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. The angle (argument) θ is arctangent of (√3/2 / (-1/2)) = arctangent(-√3). But since the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive, it's in the second quadrant. The reference angle is π/3, so θ = 2π/3. Similarly, for w = [-1 - i√3]/2, the modulus is also 1, and the angle is -2π/3 or equivalently 4π/3. \n\nTherefore, w = e^(i2π/3) and e^(i4π/3). Therefore, z² = e^(i2π/3) and z² = e^(i4π/3). To find z, we take square roots of these. \n\nTaking square roots of complex numbers in polar form: if w = e^(iθ), then the square roots are e^(iθ/2) and e^(i(θ/2 + π)). \n\nSo for w = e^(i2π/3), the square roots are e^(iπ/3) and e^(iπ/3 + iπ) = e^(i4π/3). Similarly, for w = e^(i4π/3), the square roots are e^(i2π/3) and e^(i2π/3 + iπ) = e^(i5π/3). \n\nTherefore, the four roots of the original equation z⁴ + z² + 1 = 0 are e^(iπ/3), e^(i4π/3), e^(i2π/3), and e^(i5π/3). \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. If z² = e^(i2π/3), then z is e^(iπ/3) and e^(iπ/3 + π) = e^(i4π/3). Similarly, z² = e^(i4π/3) gives z = e^(i2π/3) and e^(i2π/3 + π) = e^(i5π/3). So yes, the four roots are e^(iπ/3), e^(i2π/3), e^(i4π/3), and e^(i5π/3). \n\nNow, these are all complex numbers on the unit circle. Let me recall that e^(i2πk/n) are the nth roots of unity. So each of these roots can be expressed as e^(i2πk/n) for some integers k and n. Our job is to find the smallest n such that all four roots are nth roots of unity. \n\nLooking at the angles: π/3, 2π/3, 4π/3, 5π/3. Let me express these angles as multiples of 2π. For example, π/3 is (1/6)(2π), 2π/3 is (1/3)(2π), 4π/3 is (2/3)(2π), and 5π/3 is (5/6)(2π). Therefore, these correspond to the 6th roots of unity? Wait, the 6th roots of unity are e^(i2πk/6) for k=0,1,...,5. Let me check:\n\nFor k=1: e^(i2π/6)=e^(iπ/3) which is one of our roots. For k=2: e^(i4π/6)=e^(i2π/3). For k=4: e^(i8π/6)=e^(i4π/3). For k=5: e^(i10π/6)=e^(i5π/3). So yes, all four roots are 6th roots of unity? But wait, the 6th roots of unity also include e^(i0)=1 and e^(iπ)=-1. But those are not roots of our equation. However, the question is not requiring that all nth roots of unity are roots of the equation, but rather that all roots of the equation are nth roots of unity. So if all four roots are 6th roots of unity, then n=6 would work? But wait, let me check if that's true.\n\nBut wait, if n=6, then each root raised to the 6th power should equal 1. Let's check for z = e^(iπ/3). z^6 = e^(i6*(π/3)) = e^(i2π) = 1. Similarly, z=e^(i2π/3): z^3 = e^(i2π) = 1, so z^6 is also 1. Same for the others. Therefore, yes, all roots are 6th roots of unity. But is 6 the minimal such n? Because maybe they are also roots of a lower n?\n\nWait, let's check. Let's check for n=3. The 3rd roots of unity are e^(i2πk/3), for k=0,1,2. These are 1, e^(i2π/3), e^(i4π/3). But our roots include e^(iπ/3) and e^(i5π/3), which are not 3rd roots of unity. Therefore, n=3 is too small. How about n=4? The 4th roots of unity are 1, i, -1, -i. Our roots are different. n=5? Probably not, since the angles don't divide 2π into 5 parts. How about n=6? As above, n=6 includes all four roots. But is there a smaller n than 6 that includes all four roots? Let's check n=6 is the minimal?\n\nWait, maybe n=6 is not the minimal? Let me think. For example, suppose that all roots satisfy z^6=1, but maybe they also satisfy a lower common multiple. Wait, but maybe the roots have different orders. Let me check the order of each root. The order of a root of unity is the smallest positive integer m such that z^m = 1. \n\nTake z = e^(iπ/3). What is its order? Let's compute. The angle is π/3, so to get to 2π, we need to multiply by 6. Therefore, order 6. Similarly, e^(i5π/3) is the same, since it's the complex conjugate. For e^(i2π/3), the order is 3? Wait, because (e^(i2π/3))^3 = e^(i2π) = 1. But is there a smaller m? For m=1: no. m=2: (e^(i2π/3))^2 = e^(i4π/3) ≠ 1. So order 3. Similarly, e^(i4π/3) also has order 3. \n\nTherefore, among the roots, some have order 3, some have order 6. Therefore, the least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 6. Therefore, the minimal n is 6? But wait, but if we take n=6, then all roots are 6th roots of unity. However, the problem is asking for the smallest n such that all roots are nth roots of unity. Since some roots have order 3, which divides 6, and others have order 6. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 6. But since 6 is the least common multiple of 3 and 6, then n=6 is the minimal. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we take n=6. Then all roots are 6th roots of unity, as shown. But is there a smaller n? For example, n=12? No, 12 is bigger. Wait, but maybe there's a number smaller than 6? We saw n=3 is too small. n=4, n=5 don't work. How about n=6? So maybe 6 is the minimal. \n\nBut let me think again. Let me check if the original equation divides z^6 - 1. Because if all roots of z⁴ + z² + 1 are 6th roots of unity, then z⁴ + z² + 1 divides z^6 - 1? Let me check. Let me compute z^6 - 1. It factors as (z^3 - 1)(z^3 + 1) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)(z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1). Therefore, z^6 - 1 factors into those quadratics and linears. Our polynomial is z⁴ + z² + 1. Let me see if this is related. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps z^6 - 1 = (z^2 - 1)(z^4 + z² + 1)? Let me check. Multiply (z² - 1)(z⁴ + z² + 1) = z^6 + z^4 + z² - z^4 - z² - 1 = z^6 - 1. Yes! So z^6 - 1 factors as (z² - 1)(z⁴ + z² + 1). Therefore, z⁴ + z² + 1 is a factor of z^6 - 1. Therefore, all roots of z⁴ + z² + 1 = 0 are 6th roots of unity. Therefore, n=6 works. \n\nBut since some roots have order 3 (e^(i2π/3) and e^(i4π/3)), but 3 divides 6, so they are also 6th roots of unity. However, the question is about the minimal n such that all roots are nth roots of unity. Since there are roots of order 6 (like e^(iπ/3)), then n must be a multiple of 6. Therefore, 6 is indeed the minimal n. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check if e^(iπ/3) is a primitive 6th root of unity. Yes, because its order is 6. Similarly, e^(i5π/3) is also a primitive 6th root. The other two roots, e^(i2π/3) and e^(i4π/3), are primitive 3rd roots of unity. Therefore, the roots are a combination of primitive 3rd and 6th roots of unity. Therefore, the least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6, so the minimal n is 6. \n\nBut let me check if maybe there is a smaller n. For example, suppose n=12. But 12 is larger than 6, so 6 is smaller. How about n= something else? Let me think. Suppose n is 6, but if there is a smaller n where both 3rd and 6th roots of unity are nth roots of unity. But since 3 divides 6, but for n to contain 6th roots of unity, n must be at least 6. For example, if n=6, then 3rd roots of unity are included. If n is less than 6, say n=5, then no. n=4, no. n=3, but then the primitive 6th roots are not included. Therefore, 6 is indeed minimal. \n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Suppose we want to find the minimal n such that each root satisfies zⁿ = 1. So for each root, n must be a multiple of the order of that root. Therefore, n must be a common multiple of the orders of all roots. Therefore, n must be the least common multiple of the orders of all roots. \n\nAs we saw, the orders of the roots are 3 and 6. Therefore, LCM(3, 6) = 6. Therefore, n=6 is indeed the minimal. \n\nBut let me verify with actual computation. Take one of the roots, say e^(iπ/3). Let me compute (e^(iπ/3))^6 = e^(i2π) = 1. Also, (e^(i2π/3))^6 = e^(i4π) = 1. Similarly for others. So n=6 works. And since for n smaller than 6, say n=5, then e^(iπ/3)^5 = e^(i5π/3) ≠ 1. Because 5π/3 is not a multiple of 2π. Similarly, for n=4: e^(iπ/3)^4 = e^(i4π/3) ≠ 1. For n=3: e^(iπ/3)^3 = e^(iπ) = -1 ≠ 1. Therefore, n=3 doesn't work. Therefore, n=6 is indeed minimal. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6. \n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let me recall that z⁴ + z² + 1 = 0. Let me note that z ≠ 0, so divide both sides by z²: z² + 1 + 1/z² = 0. Therefore, z² + 1/z² = -1. Let me set w = z + 1/z. Then, w² = z² + 2 + 1/z². Therefore, z² + 1/z² = w² - 2. Therefore, our equation becomes w² - 2 = -1 ⇒ w² = 1 ⇒ w = ±1. \n\nTherefore, z + 1/z = 1 or z + 1/z = -1. Let me solve these equations. \n\nFirst, z + 1/z = 1. Multiply by z: z² + 1 = z ⇒ z² - z + 1 = 0. Solutions are [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4)] / 2 = [1 ± i√3]/2. Which are e^(iπ/3) and e^(-iπ/3) = e^(i5π/3). \n\nSecond equation: z + 1/z = -1. Multiply by z: z² + 1 = -z ⇒ z² + z + 1 = 0. Solutions are [-1 ± sqrt(-3)] / 2 = e^(i2π/3) and e^(i4π/3). \n\nTherefore, same roots as before. So the roots are primitive 6th roots and primitive 3rd roots. Therefore, again, LCM(3,6)=6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think about cyclotomic polynomials. The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial over the integers for primitive nth roots of unity. Our polynomial z⁴ + z² + 1, maybe it's a cyclotomic polynomial? \n\nLet me recall Φ_3(x) = x² + x + 1. Φ_6(x) = x² - x + 1. Φ_12(x) is degree 4? Let me check. The degree of Φ_n is φ(n), Euler's totient function. φ(3)=2, φ(6)=2, φ(12)=4. \n\nOur polynomial is degree 4. Let me check Φ_12(x). Φ_12(x) = (x^12 - 1)/[(x^6 - 1)(x^4 - 1)/(x^2 - 1))]... Wait, maybe better to recall that Φ_n(x) = product of (x - e^(2πik/n)) where k is coprime to n. For n=12, the numbers coprime to 12 are 1,5,7,11. Therefore Φ_12(x) = (x - e^(2πi/12))(x - e^(10πi/12))(x - e^(14πi/12))(x - e^(22πi/12)) = (x - e^(πi/6))(x - e^(5πi/6))(x - e^(7πi/6))(x - e^(11πi/6)). If we multiply these out, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, note that our polynomial is z⁴ + z² + 1. Let me check if this equals Φ_3(x) * Φ_6(x)? Φ_3(x) is x² + x + 1, Φ_6(x) is x² - x + 1. Multiplying them: (x² + x + 1)(x² - x + 1) = (x² + 1)^2 - x² = x^4 + 2x² + 1 - x² = x^4 + x² + 1. Yes! Therefore, our polynomial z⁴ + z² + 1 factors as Φ_3(z) * Φ_6(z). \n\nTherefore, the roots are the primitive 3rd roots of unity and the primitive 6th roots of unity. Therefore, the primitive 3rd roots are the roots of Φ_3(z) = z² + z + 1, and primitive 6th roots are roots of Φ_6(z) = z² - z + 1. \n\nTherefore, all roots of our equation are either primitive 3rd or 6th roots of unity. Therefore, to have all roots being nth roots of unity, n must be a multiple of both 3 and 6. The least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6. Therefore, n=6 is the minimal such integer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 6. \n\nBut let me check once more. Suppose someone thinks maybe n= something else. For example, if we take n=12, then all 6th roots of unity are 12th roots of unity. But since 6 is smaller, it's better. Since we need the minimal n. \n\nAlternatively, if there is some n less than 6 where primitive 3rd and 6th roots are nth roots of unity. But for example, if n=6, it works. If n= something else? For example, LCM(3,6)=6. There's no smaller number that is a multiple of both 3 and 6. Since 6 is the LCM. Therefore, 6 is the minimal. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 6. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest positive integer $ n $ is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>"}
