The friction between the comb and hair causes the comb to become charged (typically negatively), and the paper scraps are attracted due to induced polarization.  \n✅ **Electrostatic phenomenon**\n\n---\n\n**(B) A charged small ball is moved near an uncharged metal, attracting each other**  \n- When a charged object is brought near a conductor, it induces a redistribution of charges within the conductor (called **electrostatic induction**), leading to attraction.

Let me start by recalling what electrostatic phenomena are. Electrostatic phenomena involve the behavior of stationary electric charges. These can include things like attraction or repulsion between objects due to static electricity, the buildup of charges through friction, and the effects of those charges on nearby objects.\n\nFirst, let me go through each option one by one and see if they fit the definition of electrostatic phenomena.\n\nOption A: A plastic comb that has been used on hair attracts paper scraps. Hmm, when you comb your hair with a plastic comb, especially on dry days, the comb becomes charged due to friction. The comb's charge can then induce a charge on the paper scraps, causing them to be attracted. This is definitely a classic example of electrostatic attraction. So this is an electrostatic phenomenon. So A is likely correct and not the answer.\n\nOption B: A charged small ball is moved near an uncharged metal, attracting each other. Let me think. When a charged object is brought near an uncharged conductor (like a metal), it induces a separation of charges in the conductor. The side closer to the charged object will have an opposite charge induced, while the far side will have a similar charge. Since the metal is a conductor, the induced charges can move freely. The attraction between the charged ball and the induced opposite charges on the metal will cause them to attract each other. This is also an electrostatic phenomenon, because it's about the interaction of static charges. So B is an electrostatic phenomenon and not the answer.\n\nOption C: A small coil generates current when approaching a powered coil. This sounds like electromagnetic induction. When a coil is moved near another coil that is powered (i.e., carrying a current), a changing magnetic field is created, which induces a current in the nearby coil. This is Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. This is not an electrostatic phenomenon because it involves moving charges (current) and changing magnetic fields, which is part of electromagnetism rather than static electricity. So C might be the correct answer here, as it's not electrostatic.\n\nOption D: Walking across dry ground, feeling an electric shock when touching a metal handle. This is a common electrostatic discharge. When you walk on dry ground, especially in certain shoes, you can accumulate static charge through friction. When you touch a metal handle (a good conductor), the accumulated charge can discharge through your body, causing a shock. This is definitely an electrostatic phenomenon. So D is not the answer.\n\nSo the only one that's not electrostatic is option C, because it's about electromagnetic induction, which is a different branch of electromagnetism dealing with moving charges and changing magnetic fields, not static charges.\n</think>"}
