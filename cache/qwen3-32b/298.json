Set A has m consecutive integers and their sum is 2m. Set B has 2m consecutive integers and their sum is m. Also, the absolute value of the difference between the greatest element of A and the greatest element of B is 99. I need to find m.\n\nFirst, let me recall how to find the sum of consecutive integers. For consecutive integers, the average multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum. Since the numbers are consecutive, the average is just the middle number if there's an odd number of terms, or the average of the two middle numbers if even. But maybe there's a formula I can use here.\n\nFor set A: m consecutive integers sum to 2m. Let me denote the first term of set A as a. Then the terms are a, a+1, a+2, ..., a + (m-1). The sum of these is m*a + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (m-1)). The sum of the first (m-1) integers is (m-1)*m/2. Therefore, total sum is m*a + m(m-1)/2 = 2m.\n\nSo:\n\nm*a + [m(m - 1)/2] = 2m.\n\nDivide both sides by m (assuming m ≠ 0, which it can't be since we have m integers):\n\na + (m - 1)/2 = 2.\n\nTherefore:\n\na = 2 - (m - 1)/2 = (4 - m + 1)/2 = (5 - m)/2.\n\nSo the first term of set A is (5 - m)/2. Since we're dealing with integers, this must be an integer. Therefore, (5 - m) must be even. Therefore, m must be odd because 5 is odd, odd minus odd is even. So m is odd. So m is an odd integer.\n\nNow, the greatest element of set A is the last term, which is a + (m - 1). So substituting a:\n\nGreatest element of A: (5 - m)/2 + (m - 1) = (5 - m)/2 + (2m - 2)/2 = [5 - m + 2m - 2]/2 = (m + 3)/2.\n\nSo the maximum element in set A is (m + 3)/2.\n\nNow moving on to set B. Set B has 2m consecutive integers whose sum is m. Let me denote the first term of set B as b. Then the terms are b, b+1, ..., b + (2m - 1). The sum is 2m*b + sum_{k=0}^{2m - 1} k = 2m*b + (2m - 1)(2m)/2.\n\nSo total sum:\n\n2m*b + (2m - 1)(2m)/2 = m.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n2b + (2m - 1)(2)/2 = 1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n2m*b + [(2m - 1)(2m)/2] = m.\n\nLet me compute [(2m - 1)(2m)/2] = m*(2m - 1). Therefore:\n\n2m*b + m*(2m - 1) = m.\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n2b + 2m - 1 = 1.\n\nTherefore:\n\n2b = 1 - (2m - 1) = 1 - 2m + 1 = 2 - 2m.\n\nTherefore, b = (2 - 2m)/2 = 1 - m.\n\nTherefore, the first term of set B is 1 - m. Since m is an integer, this is an integer, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the greatest element of set B is b + (2m - 1) = 1 - m + 2m - 1 = m.\n\nSo the maximum element in set B is m.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the absolute value of the difference between the greatest element of A and the greatest element of B is 99. So:\n\n|Greatest A - Greatest B| = |(m + 3)/2 - m| = 99.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(m + 3)/2 - m = (m + 3 - 2m)/2 = (-m + 3)/2.\n\nTherefore, absolute value is |(-m + 3)/2| = |(3 - m)/2| = 99.\n\nTherefore:\n\n|3 - m| / 2 = 99 => |3 - m| = 198 => |m - 3| = 198.\n\nTherefore, m - 3 = 198 or m - 3 = -198 => m = 201 or m = -195.\n\nBut m is the number of elements in set A and set B. Since the number of elements must be positive integers, m must be positive. So m = 201 or m = -195 (discarded). Therefore, m = 201.\n\nWait, but let me check if m is odd. Earlier, we saw that m must be odd because (5 - m) must be even. Since m = 201, 5 - 201 = -196, which is even. So that's okay. So m is odd. So 201 is odd, so that works. So the answer is 201?\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for set A:\n\nSum is m*a + m(m - 1)/2 = 2m. Divided by m: a + (m - 1)/2 = 2. Therefore, a = 2 - (m - 1)/2. Which is (4 - m + 1)/2? Wait, hold on:\n\nWait 2 is 4/2. So 4/2 - (m - 1)/2 = [4 - m + 1]/2? Wait 4 - (m - 1) would be 4 - m + 1? Wait no:\n\nWait 2 - (m - 1)/2. Let me write 2 as 4/2. Then 4/2 - (m - 1)/2 = [4 - m + 1]/2? Wait 4 - (m - 1) is 4 - m + 1? No, 4 - (m - 1) is 4 - m + 1? Wait 4 - m + 1 is 5 - m. Yes. So yes, that's correct. So a = (5 - m)/2. Then the greatest element is a + (m - 1) = (5 - m)/2 + m - 1. Let me check that again:\n\n(5 - m)/2 + m - 1. Let me convert m - 1 to 2(m - 1)/2. Then total is [5 - m + 2m - 2]/2 = (m + 3)/2. Yes, correct. So that's the max element of A.\n\nFor set B: sum is 2m*b + (2m - 1)(2m)/2 = m. Then simplifying, 2m*b + m*(2m - 1) = m. Then divide both sides by m: 2b + 2m - 1 = 1. Therefore, 2b = 2 - 2m => b = 1 - m. Then the last term is b + 2m - 1 = 1 - m + 2m - 1 = m. Correct. So the max element of B is m. Then difference between max A and max B is |(m + 3)/2 - m| = |( - m + 3)/2| = |(3 - m)/2| = 99. Therefore, 3 - m = ±198. Therefore, m = 3 ∓ 198. Therefore, m = 3 + 198 = 201 or m = 3 - 198 = -195. Since m must be positive, m = 201. And m must be odd, which 201 is. So seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the sum for set A actually works with m = 201. Let me check with m = 201.\n\nFirst term of set A is (5 - m)/2 = (5 - 201)/2 = (-196)/2 = -98. So set A is from -98 to ... up to (m + 3)/2 = (201 + 3)/2 = 204/2 = 102. So the numbers from -98 to 102 inclusive. How many numbers is that? From -98 to 102 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So 102 - (-98) + 1 = 102 + 98 + 1 = 201. Correct. So m = 201. The sum of these numbers. Let me check if it's 2m = 402.\n\nAlternatively, since the average is (first + last)/2 = (-98 + 102)/2 = 4/2 = 2. Multiply by number of terms, 201, gives 2*201 = 402. Correct. So that works.\n\nFor set B: first term is 1 - m = 1 - 201 = -200. The set B has 2m = 402 consecutive integers starting from -200. The last term is m = 201. Let me check the number of terms: from -200 to 201 inclusive. The number of terms is 201 - (-200) + 1 = 201 + 200 + 1 = 402. Correct. The sum should be m = 201. Let me check the average times number of terms. The average is (first + last)/2 = (-200 + 201)/2 = 1/2. Multiply by 402 terms: 1/2 * 402 = 201. Correct. Perfect. So that works.\n\nThen the difference between the greatest elements: greatest of A is 102, greatest of B is 201. The absolute difference is |102 - 201| = | -99 | = 99. Which matches the problem's condition. Therefore, m = 201 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 201.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{201}\n</think>"}
