This transformation is driven by the **addition of thermal energy**, which is used to overcome the **intermolecular forces**—specifically, **hydrogen bonds**—that hold the NH₃ molecules together in the liquid state.\n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n- **Intermolecular vs. Intramolecular Forces**:  \n  During boiling, it is the **intermolecular forces** (like hydrogen bonding) that are overcome, not the **intramolecular covalent bonds** (like the N-H bonds within each NH₃ molecule). These covalent bonds are far stronger and would require much more energy to break—energy that is not typically provided during a simple phase change such as boiling.\n\n- **Temperature During Boiling**:  \n  Once the boiling point is reached, the **temperature of the system remains constant** as the added energy is used to break the intermolecular forces rather than increase the kinetic energy of the molecules. Therefore, the temperature does not rise during the boiling process.\n\n- **Energy in the System**:  \n  The **internal energy of the system increases** during boiling because energy is being added in the form of heat. This energy is used to convert the liquid into a gas, which is a higher-energy state.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n- **A: The N-H bonds within the NH₃ molecules break apart.**  \n  ❌ Incorrect. The N-H bonds are covalent and remain intact during boiling. These would only break under extreme conditions, such as in a chemical reaction.\n\n- **B: The overall temperature of the solution rises as the NH₃ molecules speed up.**  \n  ❌ Incorrect. During boiling, the temperature remains constant because the energy is used to break intermolecular bonds, not to increase molecular kinetic energy.\n\n- **C: The amount of energy within the system remains constant.**  \n  ❌ Incorrect. Energy is being added to the system to facilitate the phase change, so the internal energy increases.\n\n- **D: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH₃ molecules together break apart.**  \n  ✅ Correct. The hydrogen bonds between NH₃ molecules are intermolecular forces that are overcome during boiling, allowing the molecules to transition from the liquid to the gaseous state.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**D: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH₃ molecules together break apart.**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about liquid ammonia boiling. Let me try to figure it out. The question is asking which of the options occurs during the boiling process of NH3. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens during boiling. Boiling is a phase change from liquid to gas. For a liquid to boil, it needs to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold the molecules together. In the case of ammonia (NH3), I know that it has hydrogen bonding because nitrogen is highly electronegative and the hydrogen atoms can form hydrogen bonds with other ammonia molecules.\n\nSo during boiling, the liquid is turning into gas. That means the molecules are moving apart from each other, going from a more ordered liquid state to a more disordered gas state. The key here is that the phase change requires energy to break the intermolecular forces, but not the intramolecular bonds. The actual chemical bonds within the NH3 molecules (the N-H bonds) shouldn't break during boiling. Those would require much more energy, like in a chemical reaction or decomposition, not just a phase change.\n\nNow looking at the options:\n\nA: The N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules break apart. Hmm, as I thought earlier, that's probably not correct. Breaking those bonds would require a lot more energy than just boiling. Boiling is about overcoming intermolecular forces, not breaking covalent bonds.\n\nB: The overall temperature of the solution rises as the NH3 molecules speed up. Wait, during boiling, the temperature should remain constant, right? Because the heat energy is being used to break the intermolecular bonds (latent heat) rather than increasing the kinetic energy (temperature). So if you're at the boiling point, adding heat doesn't increase temperature until all the liquid has vaporized. So option B might be incorrect because the temperature doesn't rise during the phase change.\n\nC: The amount of energy within the system remains constant. No, that's not right. When you boil a liquid, you're adding heat energy to the system. The energy isn't remaining constant; it's increasing as you put in energy to break those hydrogen bonds. The internal energy of the system increases as it transitions to gas.\n\nD: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart. This seems plausible. Because hydrogen bonds are intermolecular forces, during boiling, those are the bonds that need to be broken for the molecules to separate into the gas phase. So D is likely the correct answer.\n\nLet me just double-check. Boiling involves overcoming intermolecular forces. For water, hydrogen bonds are broken during boiling. Same with ammonia. The actual covalent bonds (N-H) within each molecule aren't broken. The temperature remains constant during boiling because the energy goes into breaking those intermolecular bonds. So option D is correct. The other options are incorrect for the reasons I thought earlier.\n</think>"}
