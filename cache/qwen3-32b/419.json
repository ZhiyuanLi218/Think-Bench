Let me start by recalling the formula for fringe spacing. I think the formula is something like Δy = λD / d, where λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nThe question says the student is using yellow light and wants to increase the fringe spacing. So, to increase Δy, I need to see which factors can be adjusted. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Use red light as the incident light. Red light has a longer wavelength than yellow light. Since λ is in the numerator of the formula, increasing λ should increase Δy. So this should work. That makes me think option A is correct.\n\nOption B: Use blue light as the incident light. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than yellow. So decreasing λ would decrease Δy, making the fringes closer. So B would not help. So B is not correct.\n\nOption C: Increase the distance from the double slit to the screen. That's D in the formula. Since D is in the numerator, increasing D would increase Δy. So option C is also correct.\n\nOption D: Increase the distance between the slits. That's d in the formula, which is in the denominator. Increasing d would decrease Δy, so that's not helpful. So D is not correct.\n\nSo the correct options are A and C. Let me check the options again. The question asks which methods can be used, and the options are A to D. The answer should be A and C. So the correct choices are A and C. The options given are (A), (B), (C), (D). So the answer should include A and C. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Yes, the fringe spacing is directly proportional to λ and D, and inversely proportional to d. So changing λ to a longer one (red) increases it, increasing D increases it, increasing d decreases it. So yes, A and C are correct.\n</think>"}
