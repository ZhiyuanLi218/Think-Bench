Let me try to visualize the problem first. There's a quadrilateral KLMN with some perpendicular sides and diagonals. MN is perpendicular to diagonal KM, KL is perpendicular to diagonal LN. Also, MN is 65 units long, KL is 28 units. There's a line through L that's perpendicular to side KN, and it intersects diagonal KM at point O, with KO being 8 units. I need to find MO. \n\nFirst, let me sketch the quadrilateral. Convex quadrilateral means all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the diagonals KM and LN intersect each other inside the quadrilateral. \n\nGiven that MN is perpendicular to KM. So, if I imagine diagonal KM, then side MN is perpendicular to it. Similarly, KL is perpendicular to LN. Also, there's a line through L perpendicular to KN intersecting KM at O. \n\nSince there are several perpendicular lines and lengths given, maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Assign coordinates to the points and use slopes and equations to find relations. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let me choose point K as the origin (0, 0) to simplify calculations. Let me denote coordinates as follows:\n\n- Let K = (0, 0)\n- Let me assume diagonal KM is along some line. Since MN is perpendicular to KM, if I can define KM's direction, then MN will be perpendicular to that.\n\nBut maybe I need to assign coordinates step by step. Let me try to define coordinates for other points based on the given information.\n\nFirst, since MN is perpendicular to KM. Let me denote point M somewhere, then point N such that MN is perpendicular to KM. Similarly, KL is perpendicular to LN. Maybe I need to assign coordinates to points L and N as well. \n\nAlternatively, since there are perpendicular lines involved, perhaps vectors or dot products can be used. But maybe coordinate geometry is more straightforward.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nLet me assign coordinates:\n\nLet me take point K at (0, 0). Let me assume diagonal KM is along the x-axis for simplicity. Wait, but MN is perpendicular to KM. If KM is along x-axis, then MN would be vertical. Let me try that.\n\nLet me assume KM is along the x-axis. Let me denote point M as (m, 0) for some m > 0. Then MN is perpendicular to KM, so MN is vertical. Since MN is vertical, then point N has the same x-coordinate as M, so N = (m, n) for some n. Given that MN = 65, which is the length from M to N. Since MN is vertical, the length is just |n - 0| = |n|. So n = 65 or -65. Since the quadrilateral is convex, depending on the orientation. Let me assume n is positive, so N = (m, 65).\n\nNow, KL is perpendicular to LN. Let me think about point L. Let me denote coordinates for L. Since K is (0, 0), let me suppose L is (a, b). Then KL is the vector from K to L, which is (a, b). Diagonal LN connects L(a, b) to N(m, 65). The vector LN is (m - a, 65 - b). Since KL is perpendicular to LN, their dot product is zero:\n\nKL • LN = a*(m - a) + b*(65 - b) = 0.\n\nSo, equation (1): a(m - a) + b(65 - b) = 0.\n\nThat's one equation relating a, b, and m.\n\nNow, there's another condition: the line through L perpendicular to KN intersects KM at O with KO = 8. Let me parse this.\n\nFirst, KN is the side from K(0,0) to N(m, 65). The slope of KN is (65 - 0)/(m - 0) = 65/m. Therefore, the line perpendicular to KN will have slope -m/65.\n\nSo, the line through L(a, b) with slope -m/65. This line intersects diagonal KM (which is the x-axis from K(0,0) to M(m, 0)) at point O, and KO = 8. Since KM is along the x-axis, point O is somewhere on the x-axis between K and M (assuming O is between K and M, but since it's convex, maybe O is on KM extended? Wait, the problem says \"the line through L perpendicular to KN intersects diagonal KM at O\". Since KM is a diagonal, and the quadrilateral is convex, the intersection O is likely between K and M. But since KO is given as 8, maybe m is longer than 8? Let's see.\n\nSo, equation of the line through L(a, b) with slope -m/65 is:\n\ny - b = (-m/65)(x - a)\n\nThis line intersects KM, which is the x-axis (y=0). Let me find the intersection point O.\n\nSet y = 0:\n\n0 - b = (-m/65)(x - a)\n\n=> -b = (-m/65)(x - a)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nb = (m/65)(x - a)\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx - a = (65/m) * b\n\n=> x = a + (65b)/m\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of O are (a + (65b)/m, 0). Since O lies on KM (the x-axis), which goes from (0,0) to (m, 0). Therefore, the x-coordinate of O must be between 0 and m (if O is between K and M). The length KO is the distance from K(0,0) to O(a + (65b)/m, 0), which is |a + (65b)/m - 0| = |a + (65b)/m|. Given that KO = 8, so:\n\n|a + (65b)/m| = 8. Since the quadrilateral is convex and assuming O is between K and M, we can assume that a + (65b)/m is positive and less than m. Therefore:\n\na + (65b)/m = 8. Equation (2).\n\nSo, now we have equation (1): a(m - a) + b(65 - b) = 0 and equation (2): a + (65b)/m = 8. \n\nBut we need more equations to solve for variables. Let's recall that KL = 28. KL is the length from K(0,0) to L(a, b), so:\n\n√(a² + b²) = 28 => a² + b² = 784. Equation (3).\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. a(m - a) + b(65 - b) = 0\n2. a + (65b)/m = 8\n3. a² + b² = 784\n\nLet me try to manipulate these equations.\n\nFirst, equation (1):\n\na(m - a) + b(65 - b) = 0 => am - a² + 65b - b² = 0.\n\nBut from equation (3), a² + b² = 784, so substituting into equation (1):\n\nam + 65b - (a² + b²) = 0 => am + 65b - 784 = 0 => am + 65b = 784. Equation (1a).\n\nSo equation (1a): am + 65b = 784.\n\nEquation (2): a + (65b)/m = 8.\n\nSo, if I denote equation (2) as:\n\na = 8 - (65b)/m. Let me substitute this into equation (1a):\n\n[ (8 - (65b)/m ) * m ] + 65b = 784.\n\nCompute:\n\n8m - 65b + 65b = 784 => 8m = 784 => m = 784 / 8 = 98.\n\nSo, m = 98. Great! So the length of KM is m = 98? Wait, KM is from (0,0) to (m, 0), so yes, length KM is m, which is 98. But we need MO. Since O is on KM, and KO = 8, then MO = KM - KO = 98 - 8 = 90? Wait, but hold on, is O between K and M? If yes, then MO would be 98 - 8 = 90. However, maybe O is beyond M? But since the quadrilateral is convex, and the line through L perpendicular to KN intersects KM at O. Let me check.\n\nBut given that m = 98, and from equation (2): a + (65b)/m = 8. Since m is positive, and assuming coordinates are set such that O is between K and M, then MO would be 98 - 8 = 90. However, the problem might not be that straightforward. Wait, but why do we have the other equations? Because we need to check if this is consistent with other equations. Let me check if m=98 is consistent with other equations.\n\nWe found m=98 from equations (1a) and (2). Let me verify with equation (3). Let me find a and b.\n\nFrom equation (2): a = 8 - (65b)/m = 8 - (65b)/98.\n\nFrom equation (3): a² + b² = 784.\n\nLet me substitute a into equation (3):\n\n[8 - (65b)/98]^2 + b² = 784.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, expand [8 - (65b)/98]^2:\n\n= 64 - 2*8*(65b)/98 + (65b/98)^2\n\n= 64 - (1040b)/98 + (4225b²)/9604\n\nTherefore, adding b²:\n\nTotal equation:\n\n64 - (1040b)/98 + (4225b²)/9604 + b² = 784.\n\nCombine the b² terms:\n\n(4225b²)/9604 + b² = (4225b² + 9604b²)/9604 = (13829b²)/9604.\n\nSo:\n\n64 - (1040b)/98 + (13829b²)/9604 = 784.\n\nMultiply all terms by 9604 to eliminate denominators:\n\n64*9604 - (1040b)/98 * 9604 + 13829b² = 784*9604.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nFirst term: 64*9604. Let me compute 64*9604.\n\nNote that 9604 is 98², since 98*98=9604. So 64*(98²).\n\nSecond term: -(1040b)/98 * 9604. Since 9604 / 98 = 98. Therefore, this term is -1040b * 98.\n\nThird term: 13829b².\n\nRight-hand side: 784*9604. Note that 784 is 28², and 9604 is 98². Also, 784 = 8*98. Therefore, 784*9604 = 8*98*98² = 8*98³? Wait, maybe better to compute directly.\n\nBut maybe there is a smarter way. Let me note that 784 is 8*98, since 98*8 = 784. Therefore, RHS is 8*98*98² = 8*98³? Wait:\n\nWait 784*9604 = 784*(98²). Since 784 is 28², but maybe not helpful. Let me compute 784*9604:\n\nBut maybe let me go back. Let me write the equation again:\n\n64*9604 - 1040*98*b + 13829b² = 784*9604.\n\nLet me move all terms to left-hand side:\n\n64*9604 - 1040*98*b + 13829b² - 784*9604 = 0\n\nCompute 64*9604 - 784*9604 = (64 - 784)*9604 = (-720)*9604.\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n-720*9604 - 1040*98*b + 13829b² = 0.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier? Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a mistake in expanding [8 - (65b)/98]^2. Let me recalculate:\n\n[8 - (65b)/98]^2 = 8² - 2*8*(65b)/98 + (65b/98)^2 = 64 - (1040b)/98 + (4225b²)/9604. That's correct.\n\nThen adding b²: 64 - (1040b)/98 + [4225b² + 9604b²]/9604 = 64 - ... yes, 4225 + 9604 = 13829. Correct. So that term is 13829b² / 9604. \n\nThen multiplying by 9604:\n\n64*9604 - 1040*98*b + 13829b² = 784*9604. \n\nYes. So moving 784*9604 to the left gives -720*9604 - 1040*98*b + 13829b² = 0. \n\nThis seems messy, but perhaps we can divide through by some common factors? Let me check coefficients:\n\nFirst term: -720*9604\n\nSecond term: -1040*98*b\n\nThird term: +13829b²\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an error in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, we found m = 98, which is KM = 98. If that is correct, then MO = KM - KO = 98 - 8 = 90. However, maybe this is too straightforward and the problem is expecting a different answer? Or perhaps I made a wrong assumption by setting KM along x-axis? Wait, but if MN is perpendicular to KM, and I set KM along x-axis, MN is vertical, which is fine. Also, KL is perpendicular to LN, which gave us equation (1). Then with KL = 28, we have equation (3). Then solving gives m = 98, and then MO = 90. But maybe there is a mistake here because the problem is from an Olympiad, and 90 seems straightforward. Maybe I need to verify with other equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe O is not between K and M? Suppose O is beyond M on KM extended. Then KO would be longer than KM. But given that KO is 8, which is less than KM = 98, so O is between K and M. Therefore, MO = 98 - 8 = 90. But maybe there's something wrong here. Let me check with actual values of a and b.\n\nSince m = 98, equation (2) is a + (65b)/98 = 8 => a = 8 - (65b)/98. Then equation (3): a² + b² = 784. Let me denote t = b. Then a = 8 - (65t)/98. Therefore:\n\n[8 - (65t)/98]^2 + t² = 784. Let me compute this equation.\n\nLet me write 8 as 784/98 to have same denominator:\n\n8 = 784/98. Therefore:\n\na = 784/98 - (65t)/98 = (784 - 65t)/98.\n\nTherefore, a = (784 - 65t)/98.\n\nTherefore, a² + t² = [(784 - 65t)^2]/(98^2) + t² = 784.\n\nMultiply through by 98²:\n\n(784 - 65t)^2 + 98² t² = 784 * 98².\n\nLet me expand (784 - 65t)^2:\n\n= 784² - 2*784*65t + (65t)^2.\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n784² - 2*784*65t + (65t)^2 + 98² t² = 784 * 98².\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n[ (65² + 98²) t² ] - [ 2*784*65 t ] + 784² - 784*98² = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in t. Let me compute coefficients.\n\nFirst, compute 65² + 98²:\n\n65² = 4225\n\n98² = 9604\n\nSum: 4225 + 9604 = 13829. As before.\n\nSecond term coefficient: 2*784*65. Let me compute:\n\n2*784 = 1568; 1568*65. Let me compute 1568*60 + 1568*5 = 94080 + 7840 = 101,920.\n\nThird term: 784² - 784*98². Let me factor 784:\n\n784*(784 - 98²). Compute 98² = 9604. 784 - 9604 = -8820. Therefore, third term is 784*(-8820) = -784*8820.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation is:\n\n13829 t² - 101920 t - 784*8820 = 0.\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe there is a mistake in my approach? Or maybe I need to find t?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a relationship between the terms? Let me check if 784 and 98 have relations. 784 is 8²*12.25? Wait 784 is 28², 98 is 14*7. Maybe there is a ratio?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me note that 784 = 28², 98 = 14*7. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a better way. Since m = 98 is found, and if MO is 90, but need to check if this is consistent with other conditions. Wait, but if m = 98, then coordinates of M is (98, 0), N is (98, 65). Coordinates of L is (a, b) with a² + b² = 784, and a + (65b)/98 = 8. \n\nLet me suppose that there exists such a and b. For example, let me try to find a and b. Let me take equation (2): a = 8 - (65b)/98. Let me pick a value for b that makes a and b real numbers. Let me see if there is a solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a geometric interpretation. Since KL is perpendicular to LN. Given that KL is from K(0,0) to L(a,b), and LN is from L(a,b) to N(98, 65). The vectors KL = (a, b) and LN = (98 - a, 65 - b). Their dot product is zero: a(98 - a) + b(65 - b) = 0. Which we already used. \n\nBut since we already found m = 98, and with KL = 28, then coordinates of L must satisfy a² + b² = 784. Also, from equation (1a): am + 65b = 784 => with m = 98: 98a + 65b = 784. And equation (2): a + (65b)/98 = 8. \n\nBut note that equation (2) multiplied by 98 gives 98a + 65b = 8*98 = 784. Which is exactly equation (1a). Therefore, equations (1a) and (2) are dependent once m is found. Therefore, we have only two equations:\n\na² + b² = 784,\n\nand 98a + 65b = 784.\n\nTherefore, we can solve for a and b. Let me do that.\n\nLet me solve 98a + 65b = 784 for a:\n\na = (784 - 65b)/98.\n\nThen plug into a² + b² = 784:\n\n[(784 - 65b)/98]^2 + b² = 784.\n\nLet me compute [(784 - 65b)/98]^2:\n\nLet me denote numerator as 784 - 65b. Let me compute 784 / 98 = 8, and 65 / 98 is just 65/98. Therefore:\n\n[(784 - 65b)/98]^2 = [8 - (65b)/98]^2 = same as before.\n\nBut maybe instead of expanding, let me let x = b. Then:\n\n[(784 - 65x)/98]^2 + x² = 784.\n\nLet me compute [(784 - 65x)/98]^2:\n\nLet me write 784 as 8*98, so:\n\n[ (8*98 - 65x)/98 ]^2 = [8 - (65x)/98]^2.\n\nLet me set y = x, then:\n\n[8 - (65y)/98]^2 + y² = 784.\n\nThis is the same equation as before, which leads to quadratic. However, maybe there's a way to find b?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a geometric meaning here. Since KL is perpendicular to LN, and KL = 28, MN = 65. Also, with KM = 98. Maybe there is some relation with right triangles?\n\nAlternatively, since KL is perpendicular to LN, triangle KLN is a right triangle? Wait, KL is perpendicular to LN, but KL is a side and LN is a diagonal. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of vectors. KL • LN = 0. Which we already have.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinate system. Since we have two equations:\n\nEquation 1: 98a + 65b = 784.\n\nEquation 2: a² + b² = 784.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations. Let me express a from equation 1:\n\na = (784 - 65b)/98.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\na = 8 - (65b)/98. As before.\n\nLet me substitute into equation 2:\n\n[8 - (65b)/98]^2 + b² = 784.\n\nLet me compute [8 - (65b)/98]^2:\n\nLet me write 8 as 784/98:\n\n= [ (784 - 65b)/98 ]^2 + b² = 784.\n\nMultiply through by 98²:\n\n(784 - 65b)^2 + 98² b² = 784 * 98².\n\nLet me expand (784 - 65b)^2:\n\n= 784² - 2*784*65b + (65b)^2 + 98² b² - 784*98² = 0? Wait no:\n\nWait original equation after multiplying by 98² is:\n\n(784 - 65b)^2 + 98² b² = 784 * 98².\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n(784 - 65b)^2 + 98² b² - 784 * 98² = 0.\n\nExpand (784 - 65b)^2:\n\n= 784² - 2*784*65b + (65b)^2 + 98² b² - 784*98² = 0.\n\nGroup terms:\n\n[ (65b)^2 + 98² b² ] - 2*784*65b + 784² - 784*98² = 0.\n\nFactor b²:\n\nb² (65² + 98²) - 2*784*65b + 784(784 - 98²) = 0.\n\nCompute 784 - 98²:\n\nEarlier we saw that 98² = 9604, 784 - 9604 = -8820. Therefore:\n\nb²*(13829) - 2*784*65*b + 784*(-8820) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n13829b² - 101920b - 784*8820 = 0.\n\nThis quadratic equation can be solved using quadratic formula:\n\nb = [101920 ± sqrt(101920² - 4*13829*(-784*8820))]/(2*13829).\n\nThis seems very complex. Let me check if discriminant is positive:\n\nDiscriminant D = 101920² + 4*13829*784*8820.\n\nThis is definitely positive, so there are real solutions. However, calculating this by hand is tedious. Maybe there is a better way? Perhaps notice some relations between numbers?\n\nLet me check if 65 and 98 have common factors? 65 = 5*13, 98 = 2*49 = 2*7². No common factors. Similarly 784 is 28², 28 is 4*7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a ratio between a and b? Let me think. Suppose that a/b is some ratio? Let me assume that a and b are proportional to 65 and 98? Wait, since we have 98a + 65b = 784 and a² + b² = 784. Maybe if I assume that a/k = 65 and b/k = 98? Wait, let me try:\n\nLet me suppose that a = 65k and b = 98k. Then:\n\nFrom equation 98a + 65b = 98*(65k) + 65*(98k) = 65*98k + 65*98k = 2*65*98k. Set equal to 784:\n\n2*65*98k = 784 => k = 784 / (2*65*98) = 784 / (130*98).\n\nCompute 784 / 98 = 8, so k = 8 / 130 = 4 / 65 ≈ 0.0615.\n\nThen check if a² + b² = (65k)^2 + (98k)^2 = k²*(65² + 98²) = k²*13829. \n\nWe need this to be 784. Therefore:\n\nk² = 784 / 13829 => k = sqrt(784 / 13829) = 28 / sqrt(13829). But earlier we had k = 4/65. Therefore, unless 4/65 = 28 / sqrt(13829), which would mean sqrt(13829) = 28*(65)/4 = 7*65 = 455. Let me check sqrt(13829):\n\nCalculate 455²: 455*455. Well, 450² = 202500, 450² + 2*450*5 + 5² = 202500 + 4500 + 25 = 207,025. But 13829 is way smaller than that. So this assumption is invalid. Therefore, my assumption that a and b are proportional to 65 and 98 is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let me consider that 98a + 65b = 784 and a² + b² = 784. Let me think of this as a line intersecting a circle. The line 98a + 65b = 784 intersects the circle a² + b² = 784. The solutions are the points of intersection. Since the line passes through the circle (as the distance from the center to the line is less than radius), there are two points. But since quadrilateral is convex, maybe only one of them is valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize the line. Let me solve for a from the line equation:\n\na = (784 - 65b)/98.\n\nLet me plug into circle equation:\n\n[(784 - 65b)/98]^2 + b² = 784.\n\nLet me let’s compute this equation numerically. Let me denote b as variable. Maybe approximate?\n\nAlternatively, let me note that 98 and 65 are coefficients. Let me divide the line equation by something. Let me see:\n\nLet me write 98a + 65b = 784. Let me divide both sides by GCD(98, 65). Since GCD(98,65): GCD(65, 33), GCD(33, 32), GCD(32,1), so GCD is 1. Therefore, equation is primitive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution with t = b, then express a in terms of t, then plug into circle equation. Which is what I did earlier. But solving that quadratic is too tedious. Maybe there is another way?\n\nWait, going back to the problem. The problem asks for MO, which we thought is 98 - 8 = 90. However, since we couldn't find a and b, maybe there is a mistake in assuming that m = 98? Let me check again how we got m = 98.\n\nFrom equation (1a): am + 65b = 784.\n\nFrom equation (2): a + (65b)/m = 8.\n\nLet me denote equation (2) as a = 8 - (65b)/m. Plug into equation (1a):\n\n[8 - (65b)/m] * m + 65b = 784 => 8m - 65b + 65b = 784 => 8m = 784 => m = 98. \n\nYes, that is correct. The 65b terms cancel out. Therefore, regardless of the values of a and b, m must be 98. Therefore, even though we can't find a and b easily, MO is KM - KO = 98 - 8 = 90. Therefore, the answer is 90? But let me check if this is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe there is something wrong here. Because if O is on KM, and we have a line from L perpendicular to KN intersecting KM at O. However, if m = 98 is determined purely from equations (1a) and (2), independent of a and b, then MO is indeed 98 - 8 = 90. Therefore, maybe the answer is 90. However, given that the problem is from a competition, maybe there's a trick here? Or maybe my coordinate assumption is leading me to this answer?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of vectors. Let me consider the projections or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since MN is perpendicular to KM, then triangle KMN is right-angled at M? Wait, MN is perpendicular to KM, so yes, triangle KMN is right-angled at M. Therefore, KM and MN are legs, and KN is hypotenuse. Therefore, KN = sqrt(KM² + MN²) = sqrt(98² + 65²). Let me compute that:\n\n98² = 9604, 65² = 4225, sum = 9604 + 4225 = 13829. Therefore, KN = sqrt(13829). Interesting, same as the coefficient in the quadratic equation earlier. \n\nSimilarly, KL is perpendicular to LN. So triangle KLN is right-angled at L? Wait, KL is perpendicular to LN. So yes, in triangle KLN, angle at L is right angle. Therefore, by Pythagoras, KL² + LN² = KN². Wait, KL is perpendicular to LN. Wait, KL is a side and LN is a diagonal. Let me think.\n\nIf KL is perpendicular to LN, then in vectors, KL • LN = 0. But in terms of triangles, maybe not directly a right triangle. Wait, if you have a triangle where one side is perpendicular to another side? Wait, KL is a side from K to L, and LN is a side from L to N. If they are perpendicular, then triangle KLN has a right angle at L. Yes! Because KL and LN are two sides meeting at L, and they are perpendicular. Therefore, triangle KLN is right-angled at L. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nKL² + LN² = KN².\n\nGiven that KL = 28, KN we found as sqrt(13829), so:\n\n28² + LN² = 13829 => 784 + LN² = 13829 => LN² = 13829 - 784 = 13045 => LN = sqrt(13045). \n\nBut maybe we can find LN in another way? From coordinates. Since L(a, b) and N(98, 65). Then LN² = (98 - a)^2 + (65 - b)^2. From equation (1): a(98 - a) + b(65 - b) = 0 => 98a - a² + 65b - b² = 0 => 98a + 65b = a² + b². But from equation (3): a² + b² = 784. Therefore, 98a + 65b = 784. Which is our equation (1a). Therefore, LN² = (98 - a)^2 + (65 - b)^2.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= 98² - 2*98a + a² + 65² - 2*65b + b²\n\n= (a² + b²) + 98² + 65² - 2*(98a + 65b)\n\nFrom equation (3): a² + b² = 784, and from equation (1a): 98a + 65b = 784. Therefore:\n\nLN² = 784 + 9604 + 4225 - 2*784 = 784 + 13829 - 1568 = 13829 - 784 = 13045. Which matches the previous result. Therefore, all equations are consistent. Therefore, our value of m = 98 is correct. Therefore, MO = 98 - 8 = 90. \n\nBut why is the problem giving all that information about the line through L perpendicular to KN? If MO can be found directly from m = 98 and KO = 8? Is there a possibility that O is not between K and M? For example, if the line through L perpendicular to KN intersects KM extended beyond M, then MO would be positive but KO would be larger than KM. However, since KO is given as 8, which is less than KM = 98, O must be between K and M. Hence, MO = KM - KO = 98 - 8 = 90. \n\nTherefore, maybe the answer is 90? However, I need to check if there's an error in my reasoning. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the line through L perpendicular to side KN intersects diagonal KM at O with KO = 8\". In my calculation, I found that regardless of the position of L (as long as the other conditions hold), m is forced to be 98, hence MO is 90. Therefore, maybe 90 is correct. However, since this is an Olympiad problem, maybe there's a trick here. Let me check with actual coordinates.\n\nSuppose m = 98. Let me pick specific values for a and b that satisfy the equations. Let me try to find a solution for a and b.\n\nFrom 98a + 65b = 784 and a² + b² = 784. Let me try to find rational solutions? Let me assume that b is a multiple of 98? Not sure. Alternatively, suppose that b = 0. Then from 98a = 784 => a = 8. Then check a² + b² = 64 + 0 = 64 ≠ 784. Not good.\n\nSuppose a = 0. Then 65b = 784 => b = 784 / 65 ≈ 12.06. Then check a² + b² ≈ 0 + 145.4 ≈ 145.4 ≠ 784.\n\nAlternatively, let me take b = 28. Then from 98a + 65*28 = 784 => 98a + 1820 = 784 => 98a = 784 - 1820 = -1036 => a = -1036 / 98 ≈ -10.57. Then a² + b² ≈ 111.8 + 784 ≈ 895.8 ≠ 784. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that a and b satisfy a = kb for some k. Let me assume a = k*b. Then:\n\nFrom 98a + 65b = 784 => 98k*b + 65b = 784 => b*(98k + 65) = 784 => b = 784 / (98k + 65).\n\nFrom a² + b² = 784 => k²*b² + b² = 784 => b²(k² + 1) = 784 => [784² / (98k + 65)^2 ] * (k² + 1) = 784.\n\nDivide both sides by 784:\n\n784 / (98k + 65)^2 * (k² + 1) = 1 => 784(k² + 1) = (98k + 65)^2.\n\nLet me compute RHS: (98k + 65)^2 = 98²k² + 2*98*65k + 65² = 9604k² + 12740k + 4225.\n\nLHS: 784k² + 784.\n\nSet equal:\n\n784k² + 784 = 9604k² + 12740k + 4225.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n784k² + 784 - 9604k² - 12740k - 4225 = 0 => -8820k² - 12740k - 3441 = 0.\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n8820k² + 12740k + 3441 = 0.\n\nDivide by GCD of coefficients. Let me check GCD of 8820, 12740, 3441.\n\nGCD(8820, 12740): GCD(8820, 12740 - 8820) = GCD(8820, 3920). GCD(8820, 3920) = GCD(3920, 8820 - 2*3920) = GCD(3920, 980) = GCD(980, 3920 mod 980). 3920 / 980 = 4, remainder 0. So GCD is 980. Now check GCD(980, 3441). 3441 ÷ 980 = 3*980 = 2940, remainder 501. GCD(980, 501). 980 ÷ 501 = 1*501 + 479. GCD(501, 479). 501 - 479 = 22. GCD(479, 22). 479 ÷ 22 = 21*22=462, remainder 17. GCD(22,17)= GCD(17,5)= GCD(5,2)= GCD(2,1)=1. Therefore, overall GCD is 1. Therefore, equation is 8820k² + 12740k + 3441 = 0.\n\nThis quadratic equation likely has irrational roots, which is why earlier attempts to find nice values for a and b failed. Therefore, there are real solutions for a and b, but they are not nice integers or fractions. However, since we already derived that m = 98 regardless of a and b, and MO is 98 - 8 = 90, then maybe the answer is indeed 90. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming that O lies between K and M. Suppose that the line through L perpendicular to KN intersects KM extended beyond M. Then KO would be longer than KM. But since KO is given as 8, which is less than KM = 98, this is not possible. Therefore, O must lie between K and M, and MO = 98 - 8 = 90. \n\nTherefore, after careful consideration and checking, I think the answer is 90. However, to ensure, let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternative approach using vectors and projections:\n\nSince O lies on KM, we can parametrize KM. Let me consider vector KO = t * vector KM, where t is a scalar between 0 and 1 if O is between K and M. Given that KO = 8, and KM = 98, then t = 8/98 = 4/49. Therefore, MO = KM - KO = 98 - 8 = 90. This matches previous result. Therefore, regardless of other conditions, once we know KM = 98 and KO = 8, MO is 90. \n\nBut how did we find KM = 98? From the given conditions and equations. Since we used the conditions of KL ⊥ LN and the line through L perpendicular to KN intersecting KM at O with KO = 8, we derived that KM must be 98. Therefore, MO = 90. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 90. However, since this is a competition problem, and often answers are integers or fractions, 90 seems plausible. Therefore, I will go with \\boxed{90} as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{90}\n</think>"}
