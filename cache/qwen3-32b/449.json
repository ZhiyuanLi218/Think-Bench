The answer choices are A: 8.92, B: 8.68, C: 1.38, D: 12.62. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you mix different solutions, the total volume is the sum of the individual volumes. So, let me calculate the total volume first. 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL equals 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters. Got that. Now, I need to figure out the amounts of each substance in moles because that will help me determine the concentrations after mixing.\n\nStarting with acetic acid (CH3COOH). The concentration is 0.1 M, and the volume is 0.5 liters. Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. But I need to see if there are any reactions happening when we mix these solutions.\n\nNext, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. The volume is 0.4 liters, and the concentration is 0.2 M. Moles of HCl = 0.2 × 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl will donate H+ ions, so that's 0.08 moles of H+.\n\nThen, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Barium hydroxide dissociates completely in water. Each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 gives one Ba²+ ion and two OH- ions. So, the concentration of OH- will be twice the concentration of Ba(OH)2. Let me calculate the moles of Ba(OH)2 first. The volume is 0.3 liters, concentration 0.3 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, the moles of OH- = 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.\n\nNow, I need to see how the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other. The reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O. Let me figure out how much H+ and OH- are present.\n\nH+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.\n\nOH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.\n\nSo, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. The excess will determine the pH. Let's subtract the moles of H+ from OH- or vice versa.\n\n0.18 moles OH- - 0.08 moles H+ = 0.10 moles OH- remaining. So, after neutralization, there is an excess of hydroxide ions. That means the solution will be basic. The acetic acid might also affect the pH, but I need to consider if it's present in the solution after the neutralization.\n\nWait, but there's also acetic acid present. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. However, in the presence of a strong base, maybe some of the acetic acid will react with the excess OH-? Let me think.\n\nSo, the excess OH- is 0.10 moles. But there's also 0.05 moles of acetic acid. Acetic acid can react with OH- as well. Let me write the reaction:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n\nSo, each mole of acetic acid can neutralize one mole of OH-.\n\nSo, the 0.05 moles of acetic acid can react with 0.05 moles of OH-.\n\nTherefore, the remaining OH- after reacting with both H+ and acetic acid would be 0.18 (original OH-) - 0.08 (reacted with H+) - 0.05 (reacted with CH3COOH) = 0.18 - 0.08 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.\n\nWait, so first, the H+ from HCl reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then, the remaining OH- reacts with the acetic acid. So the order here is important. Let me recheck.\n\nTotal OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.\n\nTotal H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.\n\nFirst, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So, the H+ (0.08) will react with 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.\n\nThen, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with acetic acid (CH3COOH). Since acetic acid is a weak acid, but in the presence of excess OH-, which is a strong base, the reaction will go to completion. So, the acetic acid will donate H+ to the OH-.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. It can react with 0.05 moles of OH-.\n\nSo, after that reaction, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nTherefore, the total moles of OH- remaining is 0.05 moles. Then, the concentration of OH- in the total volume (1.2 L) is [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n\nThen, pOH = -log[OH-] ≈ -log(0.04167). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, log(0.04167) ≈ log(4.167 × 10^-2) ≈ log(4.167) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. Therefore, pOH ≈ 1.3802. Then pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So, answer D:12.62?\n\nBut wait, the answer choices include D:12.62. But I need to check if I considered all the reactions correctly. Let me verify again.\n\nFirst, H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. Neutralizing each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH- is 0.10 moles. Then, the acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.05 moles. It will react with the remaining OH-:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.\n\nSo, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will consume 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nYes, that seems right. Then, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M. So pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62. So answer D.\n\nBut wait, but the answer choices also have B:8.68 and A:8.92. Maybe I missed something?\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the acetic acid is a weak acid and when it's neutralized by the strong base, it forms its conjugate base, acetate ion. So, maybe after the reaction, there's a buffer solution? But in this case, all the acetic acid is consumed? Because there was 0.05 moles of acetic acid and 0.05 moles of OH- reacting with it. So, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ion (CH3COO-). Therefore, after the reaction, the solution contains acetate ion and excess OH-.\n\nBut the presence of acetate ion (a weak base) might affect the pH? Wait, but if there's excess OH- (a strong base), the contribution of the acetate ion's basicity would be negligible compared to the excess OH-.\n\nSo, the pH is mainly determined by the excess OH- concentration. Therefore, my calculation of pH ≈ 12.62 would be correct. Therefore, answer D.\n\nBut let me check if the total volume is indeed 1.2 liters. 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. Correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in considering the reaction between acetic acid and OH-? Let me think again.\n\nYes, acetic acid is a weak acid, but when it reacts with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, the reaction is forced to completion because the OH- is a strong base. Therefore, all the acetic acid will react with OH- until either the acetic acid or the OH- is consumed. In this case, there is 0.05 moles of acetic acid and 0.10 moles of OH- after neutralizing the HCl. Therefore, the acetic acid is fully consumed, and 0.05 moles of OH- are also consumed, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. Then pOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So answer D.\n\nBut let me check the math again. Let me compute [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2. 0.05 divided by 1.2 is indeed approximately 0.041666... M. Then, pOH is calculated as:\n\npOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So answer D.\n\nBut let me check if the answer is perhaps different. Suppose there was some buffer effect? For example, if after neutralizing H+ and OH-, and neutralizing acetic acid, there is some acetate ion and excess OH-.\n\nBut the acetate ion is a weak base, but in the presence of excess OH-, the OH- concentration is dominated by the excess. Therefore, the acetate ion's contribution to pH is negligible. So the pH is determined by the excess OH-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the acetate ion's basicity? Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have 0.05 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO-) in the solution, from the reaction of acetic acid with OH-. The acetate ion is a weak base with Kb = Kw / Ka, where Ka of acetic acid is 1.8×10^-5. Therefore, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 ≈ 5.56e-10.\n\nBut if we have 0.05 moles of acetate ion in 1.2 L, the concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M. However, there is also 0.05 moles of OH- in the same volume. The OH- concentration is 0.04167 M. The acetate ion would hydrolyze as follows:\n\nCH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-\n\nBut since there is already a high concentration of OH- from the excess, the contribution of the acetate's hydrolysis to the OH- concentration is negligible. Because the Kb is very small (5.56e-10), the amount of OH- produced by acetate hydrolysis is negligible compared to the 0.04167 M from the excess. Therefore, the pH is determined by the excess OH-.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, answer D:12.62.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the answer is perhaps not D. Let me think again. Suppose I made a mistake in the order of reactions. For example, maybe the HCl reacts first with the acetic acid?\n\nBut HCl is a strong acid, and acetic acid is a weak acid. The strong acid would not react with the weak acid. Instead, the strong acid and strong base would neutralize each other first. Then the remaining base would react with the weak acid.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach. The H+ from HCl (strong acid) and OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base) neutralize each other first. Then, any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). So my previous calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the pH is 12.62, answer D. But let me check the answer choices again. The options are A:8.92, B:8.68, C:1.38, D:12.62. So D is there. Therefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check once more the calculations step by step.\n\nTotal volume: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\nMoles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.\n\nMoles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.\n\nNeutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.\n\nMoles of CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.\n\nReaction between CH3COOH and OH-: 0.05 moles CH3COOH + 0.05 moles OH- → 0.05 moles CH3COO- + 0.05 moles H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nConcentration of OH-: 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.\n\npOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I calculate pOH more accurately:\n\nLet me compute log(0.041666...). Let's recall that log(4.1666×10^-2) = log(4.1666) + log(10^-2).\n\nLog(4.1666) is approximately:\n\nWe know that log(4) = 0.60206, log(4.1666) is a bit higher. Let me use a calculator-like approach.\n\nLet me remember that log(4.1666) ≈ ?\n\nLet me use the Taylor series or approximate between log(4) and log(4.3137) which is log(4.3137) = 0.6345 because 10^0.6345 ≈ 4.3137?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use known values. Let me recall that log(4) ≈ 0.60206, log(4.1) ≈ 0.6128, log(4.2) ≈ 0.6232, log(4.3) ≈ 0.6335, log(4.4) ≈ 0.6435, etc.\n\nSo, 4.1666 is between 4.1 and 4.2. Let's approximate.\n\nThe exact value of log(4.1666):\n\nLet me use linear approximation between 4.1 and 4.2.\n\nAt x = 4.1, log(x) ≈ 0.6128\n\nAt x = 4.2, log(x) ≈ 0.6232\n\nThe difference between 4.1 and 4.2 is 0.1 in x, and the difference in log(x) is 0.6232 - 0.6128 = 0.0104.\n\nOur x is 4.1666, which is 4.1 + 0.0666. So, fraction = 0.0666 / 0.1 = 0.666 of the interval.\n\nSo, approximate log(4.1666) ≈ 0.6128 + 0.666 * 0.0104 ≈ 0.6128 + 0.0069 ≈ 0.6197.\n\nTherefore, log(4.1666×10^-2) ≈ 0.6197 - 2 = -1.3803. Therefore, pOH = 1.3803, pH = 14 - 1.3803 ≈ 12.6197 ≈ 12.62. So answer D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D:12.62.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there's any other reaction I might have missed. For example, does the acetate ion react with water to produce OH-? But as I considered earlier, the concentration of OH- from acetate would be negligible compared to the excess OH-.\n\nLet me check that. The acetate concentration is 0.04167 M. The Kb for acetate is 5.56×10^-10. So, the hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nCH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-\n\nThe Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO-] ≈ 5.56e-10.\n\nAssuming that the [OH-] from acetate hydrolysis is x. Then:\n\nx^2 / 0.04167 ≈ 5.56e-10 → x ≈ sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.04167) ≈ sqrt(2.31e-11) ≈ 4.8e-6 M.\n\nSo, the [OH-] from acetate hydrolysis is ~4.8e-6 M, which is much smaller than the 0.04167 M from the excess. Therefore, it's negligible. Hence, the pH is indeed determined by the excess OH-.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D:12.62.\n\nBut let me check if the problem is perhaps a trick question where maybe the acetic acid and HCl are both acids and Ba(OH)2 is a base, but maybe I miscalculated the moles.\n\nWait, let me recheck the moles:\n\nFor HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Correct.\n\nFor Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-. Correct.\n\nFor CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Correct.\n\nTotal volume: 1.2 L. Correct.\n\nYes, calculations are correct. So answer D.\n\nBut let me check if the answer is perhaps different. For example, maybe I miscalculated the remaining OH-?\n\nOriginal OH-: 0.18 moles.\n\nMinus H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles. So 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.\n\nThen minus reaction with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles. So 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nYes. So, 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction between CH3COOH and OH-? Let me write the balanced equation:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n\nYes, that's 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH reacting with 0.05 moles of OH-.\n\nYes. So remaining OH- is 0.05 moles. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D:12.62.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
