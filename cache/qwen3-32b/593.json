The key force in this problem is the **normal force**, which is the force exerted by the surface of the inclined plane perpendicular to the surface.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Normal Force on an Inclined Plane\n\nThe total weight of the box, denoted by $ mg $, acts vertically downward. On an inclined plane, this weight can be resolved into two components:\n\n- **Parallel to the incline**: $ mg \\sin \\theta $\n- **Perpendicular to the incline**: $ mg \\cos \\theta $\n\nSince the box is not sliding, the component of the weight **perpendicular to the incline** must be exactly balanced by the **normal force**. Therefore, the normal force $ N $ is given by:\n\n$$\nN = mg \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Behavior of the Normal Force as the Angle Increases\n\nAs the angle $ \\theta $ increases, the value of $ \\cos \\theta $ decreases. This means the normal force $ N $ also decreases. However, the rate at which it decreases depends on the behavior of the cosine function.\n\n- The cosine function is **nonlinear** in the interval $ 0^\\circ < \\theta < 90^\\circ $.\n- The decrease in $ \\cos \\theta $ is not uniform with respect to the angle.\n- For example, increasing the angle from $ 0^\\circ $ to $ 30^\\circ $ causes a smaller decrease in $ \\cos \\theta $ than increasing from $ 60^\\circ $ to $ 90^\\circ $.\n\nThis means that the **rate of change of the normal force is not constant**, and thus the decrease is **nonlinear**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that the normal force is proportional to $ \\cos \\theta $, and the cosine function decreases **nonlinearly** with increasing angle, the correct answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what happens to the normal force on a box sitting on an inclined plane as the angle increases, and it's not sliding. The options are A through D. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the normal force is the force exerted by a surface to support the weight of an object resting on it. When the object is on a flat surface, the normal force is equal to the object's weight, right? But when the surface is inclined, the normal force isn't just equal to the weight anymore because the weight has components along and perpendicular to the plane.\n\nSo, if the box is on an inclined plane, I should resolve the weight into components. The weight (mg) acts vertically downward. If the angle of the incline is θ, then the component of the weight perpendicular to the plane would be mg cos θ, and the component parallel to the plane would be mg sin θ. Since the box isn't sliding, the forces must be balanced. The normal force counteracts the perpendicular component of the weight, so the normal force N should be equal to mg cos θ.\n\nNow, the question is how N changes as θ increases. If θ increases, cos θ decreases because cosine is a decreasing function in the interval from 0 to 90 degrees. So N = mg cos θ would decrease as θ increases. But the question is about how it decreases: linearly or nonlinearly?\n\nA linear decrease would mean that N is a straight line function of θ. But cos θ is a nonlinear function. For example, if θ is 0 degrees (flat surface), cos θ is 1, so N is mg. At θ = 60 degrees, cos θ is 0.5, so N is half. At θ = 90 degrees, cos θ is 0, so N is zero. The graph of N vs θ would be a cosine curve, which is nonlinear. Therefore, the decrease isn't linear; it's nonlinear. So between options B and D. The options are B: decreases linearly, D: decreases nonlinearly.\n\nSo the answer should be D. But wait, let me check if there's any other factors. The problem states that the box isn't sliding. Does that affect the normal force? Well, the normal force is still determined by the perpendicular component of the weight. The fact that it's not sliding relates to friction balancing the parallel component, but the normal force itself is still mg cos θ. So even if there's friction, the normal force calculation remains the same. So the normal force depends only on the angle and the cosine function. Therefore, the decrease is nonlinear.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if the angle increases by a certain amount, does the normal force decrease by the same amount each time? Let's take some numbers. Suppose θ goes from 0 to 30 degrees. cos 0 = 1, cos 30 ≈ 0.866. Then from 30 to 60 degrees, cos 60 = 0.5. The decrease from 0 to 30 is about 0.134, and from 30 to 60 is 0.366. So the decrease isn't constant; it's larger as the angle increases. That's a nonlinear decrease. So D is correct.\n\nSo the answer is D: decreases nonlinearly.\n</think>"}
