So we have four elements: W, X, Y, Z. They are all main group elements in the short period, meaning they're in the first three periods. Their atomic numbers are increasing, so Z has the highest atomic number. \n\nThe problem gives us a few clues:\n\n1. The atomic number of Y is equal to the sum of the atomic numbers of W and X.\n2. The number of electrons in the outermost layer of Z is half of the K shell.\n3. W and X can form a 18-electron molecule with an atomic ratio of 2:1.\n\nWe need to determine which of the options A to D is correct.\n\nFirst, let's break down each clue step by step.\n\nStarting with the second clue about Z. The K shell is the first electron shell, which can hold 2 electrons. So half of that is 1 electron. Therefore, the outermost layer (valence electrons) of Z has 1 electron. So Z is an element with 1 valence electron. Since it's a main group element in the short period, that would put Z in Group 1 (alkali metals) or Group 13 (but Group 13 has 3 valence electrons). Wait, wait. Wait, the number of valence electrons is equal to the group number for main group elements. So if Z has 1 valence electron, it must be in Group 1. However, let's think again. The K shell is the first shell, which holds 2 electrons. So half of that is 1. So Z has 1 valence electron. But the valence electrons are determined by the group. For example, Group 1 elements have 1 valence electron, Group 2 have 2, Group 13 have 3, etc. So Z is in Group 1. But since Z is a short-period element (periods 1-3), possible elements are H, Li, Na, K. But K is in period 4, which is not short period. So possible Z elements are H, Li, Na. However, H is a special case because it can be in Group 1 or sometimes considered in Group 17. But since Z is a main group element with increasing atomic numbers, and Z has higher atomic number than Y, X, W. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nThird clue: W and X can form a 18-electron molecule with an atomic ratio of 2:1. Let's think about molecules with 18 electrons and a 2:1 ratio. The formula would be W₂X or WX₂. Let's check common molecules. For example, H2O has 10 electrons, NH3 has 8, CO2 has 22. Wait, maybe O3? No, that's O3 with 18 electrons? Let me calculate. O has 6 valence electrons. O3 would have 3*6=18 electrons. But O3 is O3, which is Ozone. But the atomic ratio here is 2:1. So maybe it's something like H2O? No, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Let's check the total number of electrons. Each H has 1 electron, O has 8. But in the molecule, H2O has 2(1) + 8 = 10 electrons. But the problem says 18 electrons. So maybe another molecule. Let's think about N2O. Wait, N2O has 2 N and 1 O. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons each, O has 6. Total valence electrons: 2*5 + 6 = 16. Not 18. How about something else? Maybe H2S? H2S has 2 H (each 1) and S (6 valence electrons). Total valence electrons: 2 + 6 = 8. Still not. Wait, the problem says the molecule has 18 electrons in total? Or 18 valence electrons? The wording is \"18-e⁻ molecule\". Probably refers to the total number of valence electrons. Let's confirm. If the molecule has 18 valence electrons. Let's think of common molecules. For example, CO has 10 valence electrons. CO2 has 16. Maybe something like N2? Each N has 5 valence electrons, so N2 has 10. Not enough. How about O2? Each O has 6, so 12. Still not. Let me think. Maybe SF6? But that's a 1:6 ratio. Not 2:1. Wait, what about H2O2? That's H2O2, which is 2 H and 2 O, ratio 1:1. Valence electrons: 2*1 + 2*6 = 14. Still not. Wait, maybe a molecule like C2H2 (acetylene)? C has 4 valence electrons each, H has 1. Total valence electrons: 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. No. How about something like N2H4 (hydrazine)? 2 N (each 5) and 4 H (each 1). Total valence electrons: 2*5 + 4*1 = 14. Hmm. Maybe a molecule with more atoms. Wait, maybe something like PCl3? P has 5 valence, Cl has 7 each. Total valence electrons: 5 + 3*7 = 26. Too high. Wait, the problem says the atomic ratio is 2:1, so maybe like X2Y or XY2. Let's try to think. For example, if it's XY2, like SO2. S has 6, O has 6 each. Total valence electrons: 6 + 2*6 = 18. Yes! SO2 has 18 valence electrons. The formula is SO2, which is a 1:2 ratio of S:O. So if W and X form a molecule with atomic ratio 2:1, maybe it's O2S or SO2? Wait, the atomic ratio is 2:1. If it's SO2, then the ratio is 1:2 (S:O). So that's not 2:1. Alternatively, if it's O2S, but that's the same as SO2. So perhaps the formula is X2Y? Let me think. Suppose W is O and X is S? But S is in period 3. Wait, but the atomic numbers are increasing, so W, X, Y, Z. If W and X form a molecule with ratio 2:1 and 18 valence electrons, then maybe it's like O3? But O3 is O3, which is 3 O atoms, ratio 1:1:1. Not 2:1. Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the total number of valence electrons. If the molecule has 18 valence electrons and the ratio is 2:1, then let's denote the formula as W2X. Let's say W is element A and X is element B. Then the total valence electrons would be 2*(valence of A) + valence of B = 18. Let's try some possibilities. For example, if W is O (valence 6) and X is O (same element?), but the atomic numbers are increasing, so W and X are different. Suppose W is N (valence 5) and X is O (valence 6). Then 2*5 + 6 = 16. Not 18. If W is O (6) and X is S (6), but S is in period 3. But the atomic numbers are increasing, so X must have a higher atomic number than W. If W is N (7) and X is O (8), then Y is W + X = 7 + 8 = 15. So Y would be atomic number 15, which is P (phosphorus). Then Z has higher atomic number. Let me check if that fits. Let's proceed with this possibility. \n\nSo if W is N (7), X is O (8), then Y is 7 + 8 = 15, which is P (phosphorus). Then Z has higher atomic number than Y (15). Let's see what Z could be. From earlier, Z has 1 valence electron. So possible elements are in Group 1. The next element after P (15) would be S (16), Cl (17), Ar (18), K (19), but K is period 4. Wait, the elements are in short period (periods 1-3). So Z must be in period 1, 2, or 3. If Y is P (15), Z must be higher. So possible elements are S (16), Cl (17), Ar (18). But Z has 1 valence electron. Let's check:\n\n- S is in Group 16 (valence electrons 6)\n- Cl is Group 17 (7 valence)\n- Ar is noble gas (8 valence)\nNone of these have 1 valence electron. Wait, this contradicts our earlier conclusion. So maybe our assumption about W and X is wrong.\n\nLet me go back. If the molecule is W2X with 18 valence electrons, then 2*(valence of W) + valence of X = 18. Let's try different combinations. Let's suppose W is H (valence 1). Then 2*1 + valence of X = 18 → valence of X = 16, which is impossible. So W is not H. If W is B (valence 3), then 2*3 + X's valence = 18 → X's valence = 12. Also impossible. How about W is C (4)? 2*4 + X's valence = 18 → X's valence = 10. No. W is N (5): 2*5 + X = 18 → X=8. So X has 8 valence electrons. But the maximum valence electrons for main group elements is 8 (noble gases). So X would be a noble gas. But X is in a molecule, so probably not a noble gas. Unless it's something like Xe, but Xe is in period 5. Also, noble gases are generally unreactive. So maybe not. Let's check if there's another possibility. Maybe the molecule is WX2 instead of W2X. If the atomic ratio is 2:1, maybe it's W2X or X2W. Let me check both. For WX2: valence of W + 2*(valence of X) = 18. Let's try some possibilities. Suppose W is S (6 valence) and X is O (6). Then S + 2*O = 6 + 2*6 = 18. Yes! So SO2 has 18 valence electrons. The atomic ratio is 1:2 (S:O), but the problem says the atomic ratio is 2:1. Wait, here it's 1:2. So if the ratio is W:X of 2:1, then maybe the formula is X2W. For example, if the formula is O2S, which is the same as SO2, but the ratio is O:S 2:1. So if W is O and X is S, then the atomic ratio is 2:1 (O:S). But S has higher atomic number than O. Since atomic numbers are increasing, W < X < Y < Z. So if W is O (8), then X must be higher, like S (16). Then Y would be O + S = 8 + 16 = 24. But 24 is not a short-period element. The highest atomic number in short periods is 18 (Ar). So this is impossible. Therefore, this combination is invalid. \n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Maybe the molecule is something like H2O, but with more electrons. Wait, H2O has 8 valence electrons. Maybe a larger molecule. Wait, the problem says \"18-e⁻ molecule\". Maybe it's a molecule with a total of 18 electrons, not just valence electrons? For example, the total number of electrons in the molecule is 18. Let's check. For example, H2O has 10 electrons total (2*1 + 8 = 10). If the molecule has 18 total electrons, then the sum of protons and electrons? Wait, no. In a neutral molecule, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. So total electrons would be equal to the sum of atomic numbers. Wait, that's an interesting thought. If the molecule is neutral, the total number of electrons is equal to the sum of the atomic numbers of all atoms. So if the molecule has 18 electrons total, then the sum of atomic numbers of all atoms in the molecule is 18. Given that the molecule has an atomic ratio of 2:1, let's denote it as W2X. So total atomic numbers would be 2*(atomic number of W) + atomic number of X = 18. \n\nIf this is the case, then we have 2Z_W + Z_X = 18. And also, from the first clue, Z_Y = Z_W + Z_X. \n\nLet me consider this possibility. Let's assume the molecule has 18 total electrons (i.e., total atomic numbers sum to 18). Then:\n\n2Z_W + Z_X = 18.\n\nAlso, Z_Y = Z_W + Z_X.\n\nSince Z is the highest, and all elements are in short periods (so atomic numbers up to 18).\n\nLet me try to find possible integers for Z_W, Z_X, Z_Y, Z_Z.\n\nLet's suppose W and X form a molecule with 2:1 ratio and total electrons (atomic numbers sum) 18. Let's try possible combinations.\n\nLet me list possible combinations for 2Z_W + Z_X = 18.\n\nPossible values for Z_W and Z_X (with Z_X > Z_W, since atomic numbers are increasing):\n\nStart with Z_W=1 (H):\n\n2*1 + Z_X = 18 → Z_X=16. So X would be sulfur (S). Then Y = Z_W + Z_X = 1 + 16 = 17, which is Cl. Then Z has higher atomic number than Y (17), so Z could be Ar (18). Let's check if this fits with the other clues about Z.\n\nZ is Ar (18). The number of electrons in the outermost layer of Z is half of the K shell. The K shell holds 2 electrons, so half is 1. Ar has 8 valence electrons (since it's in Group 18). But 8 is not 1. So this doesn't fit. So this combination is invalid.\n\nNext, Z_W=2 (He). But He is a noble gas and probably not forming molecules. Also, the atomic numbers are increasing, so if W is He (2), then X must be higher, but He is unlikely to form a molecule. So discard.\n\nZ_W=3 (Li). Then 2*3 + Z_X = 18 → Z_X=12. X is Mg. Then Y = 3 + 12 = 15, which is P. Z must be higher than 15. Let's check Z. Z has valence electrons equal to half of K shell (1). So Z is in Group 1. Possible Z in short period: Li (3), Na (11), K is period 4. But since Z must be higher than Y (15), possible Z is K (but not short period) or maybe... Wait, no. The next Group 1 element after Na is K (19), which is period 4. But since Z is in short period, the only possible is Na (11), but 11 is less than Y=15. So this doesn't work. So invalid.\n\nZ_W=4 (Be). 2*4 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=10. X is Ne. Again, noble gas, unlikely to form molecules. Disregard.\n\nZ_W=5 (B). 2*5 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=8. But Z_X must be higher than Z_W (5), but 8 is higher (O). So X is O. Then Y = 5 + 8 = 13, which is Al. Then Z must be higher than 13. Let's check Z. Z has valence electrons = 1. So possible Z in Group 1. Next Group 1 element after Al (13) would be K (19), which is not short period. Or maybe Na (11) but that's lower than 13. So invalid.\n\nZ_W=6 (C). 2*6 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=6. But Z_X must be higher than Z_W (6), so invalid.\n\nZ_W=7 (N). 2*7 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=4. But Z_X=4 < Z_W=7. Invalid.\n\nWait, this approach seems not working. Maybe the initial assumption that the total electrons in the molecule is 18 is wrong. Let me go back.\n\nAlternative approach: the problem says \"18-e⁻ molecule\", which likely refers to valence electrons. Let's think again. For example, the molecule SO3 has 24 valence electrons. Wait, earlier thought about SO2: S has 6, each O has 6, total 6 + 2*6 = 18. Yes, SO2 has 18 valence electrons. The formula is SO2, which is a 1:2 ratio. So if the atomic ratio is 2:1, perhaps the formula is O2S? Which is the same as SO2. So if W is O (atomic number 8) and X is S (16), then the atomic ratio is O:S 2:1. But since atomic numbers are increasing, W must be less than X. So if W is O (8), then X is S (16). Then Y is W + X = 8 + 16 = 24. But 24 is not a short-period element (short period is up to period 3, atomic number up to 18). So invalid. Therefore, this combination is not possible.\n\nWait, maybe W is something else. Let's think of other molecules with 18 valence electrons and 2:1 ratio. For example, N2O3? Let's check. N has 5 valence, O has 6. N2O3: 2*5 + 3*6 = 10 + 18 = 28. No. How about NO2? 5 + 2*6 = 17. Close. Not 18. Maybe NO2⁻? But that's an ion. Hmm. What about O3? 3*6 = 18. But atomic ratio is 1:1:1. Not 2:1. How about something like H2O2? Valence electrons: 2*1 + 2*6 = 14. No. Wait, maybe something with more electrons. Let me think. Maybe a molecule with a triple bond or something. For example, N2 has 10 valence electrons. Not enough. How about something like PCl3? P has 5, Cl has 7 each. 5 + 3*7 = 26. Too much. Wait, maybe a molecule with a charge? But the problem says it's a molecule, so probably neutral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is something like H2S? No, valence electrons are 8. Not 18. Wait, maybe a larger molecule. For example, if it's something like C2H6 (ethane)? Valence electrons: 2*4 + 6*1 = 14. No. C2H4 (ethene): 2*4 + 4*1 = 12. Still no. C2H2: 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. Not helpful. How about something like SiO2? Silicon has 4 valence, O has 6 each. Total valence electrons: 4 + 2*6 = 16. Close to 18. Not quite. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule is something like OF2? Oxygen (6) and two F (7 each). Total valence electrons: 6 + 2*7 = 20. Close to 18. No. How about O2? 2*6=12. No. Maybe something else. Wait, maybe the molecule is something like H2O with a charge? Like H2O^+? But the problem says it's a molecule, so likely neutral. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. The problem says it's a 18-e⁻ molecule with atomic ratio 2:1. Let's consider the possibility that the molecule is something like XeF2, but Xe is in period 5. Not short period. \n\nWait, another idea: maybe the molecule is something like BeCl2? But Be is in Group 2. Valence electrons: Be has 2, each Cl has 7. Total valence electrons: 2 + 2*7 = 16. Still not 18. \n\nWait, what about something like B2H6? But boron hydrides are not simple. Valence electrons: 2*3 + 6*1 = 12. No. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule is something like N2H4? Valence electrons: 2*5 + 4*1 = 14. No. \n\nWait, I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to revisit the clue about Z. The number of electrons in the outermost layer of Z is half of the K shell. The K shell holds 2 electrons, so half is 1. So Z has 1 valence electron. Therefore, Z is in Group 1. In short periods (periods 1-3), Group 1 elements are H (1), Li (3), Na (11). Since Z has the highest atomic number among W, X, Y, Z, and Y is the sum of W and X. Let's consider possible Z.\n\nIf Z is Na (11), then Y must be less than 11. So Y < 11. Then Y = W + X. Let's say Z is Na (11). Then Y must be less than 11. Let's try to find W and X such that Y = W + X < 11, and W and X form a molecule with 18 valence electrons and 2:1 ratio.\n\nLet me try possible Y values. Let's assume Y is, say, 9 (F). Then W + X = 9. Possible combinations for W and X (W < X, both < Y=9). For example, W=4 (Be), X=5 (B). But would they form a molecule with 2:1 ratio and 18 valence electrons? Let's check. If the formula is W2X, valence electrons would be 2*(Be valence) + B valence. Be has 2 valence electrons, B has 3. Total valence electrons: 2*2 + 3 = 7. Not 18. Not helpful.\n\nAnother possibility: Y=8 (O). Then W + X = 8. Possible combinations: W=3 (Li), X=5 (B). Valence electrons for W2X: 2*1 (Li has 1 valence) + 3 (B has 3) = 5. No. Not 18.\n\nIf Y=7 (N), W + X =7. Possible W=2 (He), X=5 (B). But He doesn't form molecules. \n\nThis approach isn't working. Let me think differently. Let's consider Z is Na (11). Then Y must be less than 11. Let's say Y is 9 (F), then W + X =9. Let's think about W and X forming a molecule with 18 valence electrons. Let's say the molecule is WX2. Valence electrons: W + 2*X = 18. Let's try W=5 (N, valence 5), X=6.5? No, atomic numbers must be integers. Alternatively, if the formula is W2X, then 2*W + X = 18. Let's try with W and X such that their sum is 9 (for Y=9). So W + X =9, and 2*W + X =18. Subtracting the equations: (2W + X) - (W + X) = 18 - 9 → W = 9. But W + X =9, so if W=9, then X=0, impossible. Not possible. \n\nMaybe Y is higher. Let's try Y=10 (Ne). Then W + X =10. Let's see if there are W and X such that they form a molecule with 18 valence electrons. Let's assume the molecule is WX2. Valence electrons: W + 2*X =18. And W + X =10. Let's solve these equations. From W + X =10 → W =10 - X. Substitute into the first equation: (10 - X) + 2X =18 → 10 + X =18 → X=8. Then W=10 - 8=2. So W=2 (He), X=8 (O). But He doesn't form molecules. So invalid.\n\nIf the molecule is W2X: 2W + X =18, and W + X =10. Subtract: 2W + X - W - X =18 -10 → W=8. Then X=10 - W=2. But X must be higher than W (since atomic numbers increase). Here, X=2 < W=8. Invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's try Y=11 (Na), but Z must be higher than Y, so Z would need to be higher than 11, but Z is in short period, so maximum is Ar (18). But if Y=11, then Z could be K (19), which is not short period. So invalid.\n\nMaybe Z is in Group 1 but is H? Wait, H is in period 1. If Z is H, but atomic numbers are increasing, so Z must have higher atomic number than Y, which would mean Y < 1. Impossible. So Z can't be H. So Z must be either Li (3), Na (11), or maybe K (but not short period). Let's try Z=Li (3). Then Y must be less than 3. But Y is the sum of W and X, which are smaller. Let's say W=1 (H), X=2 (He). Then Y=3, which is Li. But Z=Li has atomic number 3, which is equal to Y=3. But the problem states atomic numbers are increasing: W < X < Y < Z. So Z must be higher than Y. Hence, Z=Li is not possible if Y=3. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another way to interpret the Z clue. The number of electrons in the outermost layer of Z is half of the K shell. K shell has 2 electrons, so half is 1. So Z has 1 valence electron. So Z is in Group 1. Possible elements in short periods: H (1), Li (3), Na (11). Let's consider each possibility.\n\nCase 1: Z is Na (11). Then Y < 11. Let's assume Y is 9 (F). Then W + X =9. Let's think about W and X forming a molecule with 18 valence electrons. Let's try W=O (8), X=F (9). But atomic numbers would be W=8, X=9. Then Y=8+9=17, which is Cl. But in this case, Y=17, which is higher than Z=11, which contradicts Z being higher. So invalid. Wait, maybe W and X are smaller. Let's say W=7 (N), X=2 (He). But He doesn't form molecules. Not helpful.\n\nCase 2: Z is Li (3). Then Y <3. Possible Y=2 (He), but Y is sum of W and X. If Y=2, then W and X must be 1 and 1, but atomic numbers must be increasing, so W < X. Can't have W=1 and X=1. Invalid.\n\nCase 3: Z is H (1). But atomic numbers are increasing, so Z must be higher than Y, X, W. But H is the smallest, so impossible.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the Z clue. The problem says \"the number of electrons in the outermost layer of Z is half of the K shell.\" The K shell is the first electron shell, which holds 2 electrons. Half of that is 1. So Z has 1 electron in its outermost shell. That would mean Z is in Group 1. But let's consider if Z is in a different shell. Wait, no. The K shell is the first shell. The number of electrons in the outermost layer (valence electrons) is half of the K shell's capacity. So 2/2 = 1. So Z has 1 valence electron. So it must be Group 1.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the other clues? Let's think again about the molecule with 18 valence electrons. Maybe it's not a simple molecule. Let me think of another approach. Let's list all possible molecules with 18 valence electrons and see if they fit.\n\nFor example, SO3 has 6 + 3*6 = 24. No. SO2 has 6 + 2*6 = 18. Yes. So SO2 has 18 valence electrons. The atomic ratio is 1:2 (S:O). If the problem says the atomic ratio is 2:1, then it could be O2S, but that's the same as SO2. If W is O and X is S, then the atomic ratio is 2:1 (O:S). But then W=O (8), X=S (16). Y=8+16=24, which is not a short-period element. So invalid.\n\nBut what if the molecule is something like N2O? Valence electrons: 2*5 + 6 = 16. No. N2O3: 2*5 + 3*6 = 28. No. NO3^- has 5 + 3*6 + 1 = 24 (but it's an ion). \n\nWait, what about something like PCl3? P has 5, Cl has 7 each. Total valence electrons: 5 + 3*7 = 26. No. PCl2? Not common. \n\nWait, let's think about the possibility that the molecule is something like H2O with a charge. For example, H2O^+ has 10 - 1 = 9 electrons. No. Not helpful. \n\nMaybe the molecule is something like O3? 3*6 = 18. Yes! Ozone has 18 valence electrons. The atomic ratio is 3:0, but the problem says 2:1. Not matching.\n\nWait, what if the molecule is something like H2O2? Valence electrons: 2*1 + 2*6 = 14. No. \n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to think of the possible elements for Z. If Z has 1 valence electron and is in short period, possible elements are Li (3), Na (11), and H (1). But H is usually in Group 1 or 17. Let's consider Z as Na (11). Then Y must be less than 11. Let's try Y=9 (F), then W + X =9. Let's assume W=4 (Be), X=5 (B). But they don't form a stable molecule. W=5 (B), X=4 (not possible, since X must be higher). W=3 (Li), X=6 (C). Li and C can form a compound, but what about the valence electrons? If the molecule is Li2C? But carbon usually doesn't form such compounds. Alternatively, if the molecule is LiC2? Not sure. Let's calculate valence electrons. If it's Li2C: 2*1 (Li) + 4 (C) = 6. Not 18. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule is something like N2? Valence electrons: 10. No. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's go back to the first clue: Y = W + X. Let's assume W, X, Y are in short periods. Let's list possible atomic numbers. Let's say W=6 (C), X=8 (O), Y=14 (Si). But Si is in period 3. Z would be higher, say 15 (P). But P has 5 valence electrons, not 1. Doesn't fit Z's condition.\n\nWait, let's think of Y=15 (P). Then W + X =15. Possible combinations: W=7 (N), X=8 (O). Then Y=15 (P). Let's check if W and X (N and O) can form a molecule with 18 valence electrons and 2:1 ratio. If the formula is N2O, valence electrons: 2*5 + 6 = 16. No. If it's NO2, valence electrons: 5 + 2*6 = 17. Close. If it's NO3^- (but it's an ion). If the formula is N2O3, valence electrons: 2*5 + 3*6 = 28. No. Not helpful. \n\nBut wait, what if the molecule is something like N2O4? Which is dinitrogen tetroxide. Valence electrons: 2*5 + 4*6 = 10 + 24 = 34. No. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule is something like N2O5? Valence electrons: 2*5 + 5*6 = 10 + 30 = 40. No. \n\nHmm. Let me try another combination for Y=15: W=5 (B), X=10 (Ne). But Ne is a noble gas. Invalid. W=4 (Be), X=11 (Na). But X=11 is Na, which would make Y=15 (Be + Na =4+11=15). Then Z would have atomic number higher than 15, say 16 (S). But S has 6 valence electrons. Not 1. \n\nWait, this is going nowhere. Maybe the initial assumption about the molecule is wrong. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the 18-e⁻ molecule is a diatomic molecule? Like O3 (ozone) with 18 electrons. But the atomic ratio is 3:0, not 2:1. Not matching. \n\nWait, what if the molecule is something like H2O with a charge? For example, H2O^+ has 10 - 1 = 9 electrons. No. \n\nWait, let's consider that the 18-e⁻ molecule is a complex ion, but the problem says it's a molecule. \n\nMaybe the molecule is something like SF6? But that has 6 F atoms. Valence electrons: 6 + 6*7 = 48. No. \n\nWait, what about something like CO3^2-? Valence electrons: 4 + 3*6 + 2 = 24. No. \n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look for another angle. Let's think about Z having 1 valence electron. If Z is in Group 1, and in short period, possible elements are Li (3), Na (11), and H (1). Let's try Z=Na (11). Then Y must be less than 11. Let's say Y=9 (F), then W + X =9. Let's think about W and X forming a molecule with 18 valence electrons. Let's say W=3 (Li), X=6 (C). The molecule could be Li2C, but valence electrons: 2*1 + 4 = 6. Not 18. Not helpful. \n\nWait, what if W and X are both in the same period? Let's say W=7 (N), X=8 (O). Y=15 (P). Z=16 (S). But Z=16 has 6 valence electrons, not 1. Doesn't fit. \n\nWait, let's try Z=K (19), but it's not short period. Invalid. \n\nMaybe the clue about Z is misinterpreted. Let me re-read: \"the number of electrons in the outermost layer of Z is half of the K shell.\" The K shell has 2 electrons, so half is 1. So Z has 1 electron in its outermost shell. This means it's in Group 1. Let's assume Z is in Group 1, short period: Li (3), Na (11). Let's try Z=Na (11). Then Y must be less than 11. Let's say Y=10 (Ne). But Ne is a noble gas. Y is supposed to be a main group element. Let's say Y=9 (F). Then W + X =9. Let's think of W=4 (Be), X=5 (B). But they don't form a stable molecule with 18 valence electrons. \n\nWait, let's try W=6 (C), X=3 (B). But X must be higher than W. No. \n\nWait, let's think of W=2 (He), X=7 (N). But He doesn't form molecules. \n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I need to consider that the molecule has 18 electrons in total, not valence. Let's try that. If the molecule has 18 total electrons, then the sum of atomic numbers of all atoms is 18 (since in a neutral molecule, number of electrons equals number of protons, which is the sum of atomic numbers). \n\nLet's assume the molecule is W2X, so 2Z_W + Z_X = 18. And Y = Z_W + Z_X. Let's try possible values.\n\nStart with Z_W=1 (H): 2*1 + Z_X = 18 → Z_X=16 (S). Then Y=1+16=17 (Cl). Z must be higher than 17, but in short period, the highest is 18 (Ar). So Z=18 (Ar). Check if Ar has 1 valence electron. Ar has 8 valence electrons (Group 18), not 1. Invalid.\n\nZ_W=2 (He): 2*2 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=14 (Si). Y=2+14=16 (S). Z must be higher than 16, so Z=17 (Cl) or 18 (Ar). Cl has 7 valence electrons (Group 17), Ar has 8 (Group 18). Neither has 1. Invalid.\n\nZ_W=3 (Li): 2*3 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=12 (Mg). Y=3+12=15 (P). Z must be >15, so Z=16 (S), 17 (Cl), 18 (Ar). None have 1 valence electron. Invalid.\n\nZ_W=4 (Be): 2*4 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=10 (Ne). Y=4+10=14 (Si). Z must be >14, so Z=15 (P), 16 (S), etc. P has 5 valence, not 1. Invalid.\n\nZ_W=5 (B): 2*5 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=8 (O). Y=5+8=13 (Al). Z must be >13, so Z=14 (Si), 15 (P), etc. None have 1 valence electron. Invalid.\n\nZ_W=6 (C): 2*6 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=6. But Z_X must be >6 (since X > W). Invalid.\n\nZ_W=7 (N): 2*7 + Z_X=18 → Z_X=4. Invalid.\n\nSo this approach also doesn't work. Maybe the molecule is WX2 instead of W2X. Let's try that: Z_W + 2*Z_X = 18. And Y=Z_W + Z_X.\n\nLet's try possible values.\n\nStart with Z_X=1 (H): Z_W + 2*1 =18 → Z_W=16 (S). Y=16 +1=17 (Cl). Z must be >17, which is Ar (18). Check Ar: 8 valence, no. Invalid.\n\nZ_X=2 (He): Z_W + 4 =18 → Z_W=14 (Si). Y=14 + 2=16 (S). Z must be >16: Cl, Ar. No 1 valence. Invalid.\n\nZ_X=3 (Li): Z_W + 6 =18 → Z_W=12 (Mg). Y=12 +3=15 (P). Z must be >15: S, Cl, Ar. No 1 valence. Invalid.\n\nZ_X=4 (Be): Z_W + 8 =18 → Z_W=10 (Ne). Y=10 +4=14 (Si). Z must be >14: P, S, etc. No 1 valence. Invalid.\n\nZ_X=5 (B): Z_W +10=18 → Z_W=8 (O). Y=8 +5=13 (Al). Z must be >13: Si, P, etc. No 1 valence. Invalid.\n\nZ_X=6 (C): Z_W +12=18 → Z_W=6 (C). But Z_X=6, so X=6, W=6. But W < X. Invalid.\n\nZ_X=7 (N): Z_W +14=18 → Z_W=4 (Be). Y=4 +7=11 (Na). Z must be >11: Mg (12), Al (13), etc. But Z should have 1 valence electron. Mg is Group 2 (2 valence), Al is Group 13 (3 valence). No. Invalid.\n\nZ_X=8 (O): Z_W +16=18 → Z_W=2 (He). Y=2 +8=10 (Ne). Z must be >10: Na (11). Check Na: Group 1, 1 valence electron. Yes! This fits!\n\nSo let's check this possibility:\n\n- Z_X=8 (O), Z_W=2 (He). But W=He (2), X=O (8). But He doesn't form molecules. However, let's proceed to see.\n\nY=2 +8=10 (Ne). Z must be >10, so Z=11 (Na). Na has 1 valence electron, which fits the clue about Z. \n\nNow, the molecule is WX2, where W=He (2), X=O (8), formula HeO2? But helium doesn't form compounds. This is a problem. However, maybe there's a mistake in the assumption. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nWait, the molecule is WX2, with Z_W + 2*Z_X =18. We found Z_X=8 (O), Z_W=2 (He). But HeO2 is not a real molecule. This suggests an error in our approach. Maybe the molecule is something else, but we have to go with the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is something like H2O, but with W=H and X=O. Let's check: if the molecule is H2O, then Z_W=1 (H), Z_X=8 (O). The formula is H2O, which is 2:1 ratio. Let's check if the total electrons (protons) sum to 2*1 + 8 = 10, which is not 18. But earlier, when we assumed the total electrons is 18, we got a contradiction. But if we consider the valence electrons, H2O has 2*1 + 6 = 8 valence electrons. Not 18. \n\nBut according to our previous calculation, if we assume the total electrons (protons) is 18, then for WX2, Z_W=2 (He), Z_X=8 (O), but the molecule is HeO2, which doesn't exist. This suggests that our assumption about the total electrons is wrong. \n\nBut this is the only combination that gives Z=Na with 1 valence electron. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let's proceed with this possibility, assuming that the molecule is something else, even if it's not a real compound. \n\nSo, assuming W=He (2), X=O (8), Y=10 (Ne), Z=11 (Na). Now, let's check the options.\n\nOption A: Simple ionic radius: Z > X > Y. Z is Na+, X is O^2-, Y is Ne. Ionic radius: Na+ is smaller than O^2- (since O^2- has more electrons and same shell as F-), and Ne is a noble gas, not an ion. But if comparing ionic radii, Na+ is smaller than O^2- (which is larger), and Ne is not an ion. But the question says \"simple ionic radius,\" so maybe comparing ions. If Y is Ne, it's not an ion. This might be a problem. But let's see: if Y is Ne, it's a noble gas, so it doesn't form ions. So this option might be invalid. But let's proceed.\n\nOption B: W and Y can form a compound containing non-polar bonds. W is He, Y is Ne. They don't form compounds. Invalid.\n\nOption C: Boiling point of the simplest hydride of X and Y: X > Y. X is O, simplest hydride is H2O. Y is Ne, which doesn't form hydrides. Invalid.\n\nOption D: The aqueous solution of the compounds composed of W, X, and Y all shows acidity. W=He, X=O, Y=Ne. They don't form compounds. Invalid.\n\nThis suggests that our assumption is wrong. But where is the error?\n\nMaybe the molecule is not WX2 but W2X, and we need to find a different combination. Let's try again with W2X and total electrons 18.\n\nLet's try Z_W=7 (N), Z_X=4 (but X must be higher than W=7, so invalid). \n\nWait, let's try Z_W=5 (B), Z_X=8 (O). 2*5 + 8 = 18. So molecule is B2O. But boron oxide is B2O3, not B2O. Not sure. Valence electrons: 2*3 + 6 = 12. Not 18. \n\nWait, if the molecule is B2O3, valence electrons: 2*3 + 3*6 = 24. No. \n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to think outside the box. What if Z is in Group 13, but has 1 valence electron? No, Group 13 has 3 valence electrons. \n\nWait, maybe the clue about Z's valence electrons is misinterpreted. The problem says \"the number of electrons in the outermost layer of Z is half of the K shell.\" The K shell has 2 electrons, so half is 1. So Z has 1 electron in its outermost shell. This is Group 1. Let's assume Z is in Group 1, short period: Li, Na, H.\n\nLet's try Z=Na (11). Then Y must be less than 11. Let's say Y=10 (Ne). Then W + X =10. Let's say the molecule is WX2 with 18 valence electrons. Valence electrons: W + 2*X =18. And W + X =10. Solving: W =10 - X. Substituting: (10 - X) + 2X =18 → 10 + X =18 → X=8, W=2. So W=2 (He), X=8 (O). Molecule is HeO2, which doesn't exist, but let's proceed. Y=10 (Ne), Z=11 (Na). Now, let's check the options.\n\nOption A: Simple ionic radius: Z (Na+) > X (O^2-)? No, because O^2- has a larger ionic radius than Na+. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: W (He) and Y (Ne) can form a compound with non-polar bonds. They don't form compounds. Incorrect.\n\nOption C: Boiling point of simplest hydride of X (O: H2O) and Y (Ne: no hydride). Invalid.\n\nOption D: Compounds of W, X, Y (He, O, Ne) show acidity. No such compounds. Invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the correct elements are not in this setup. Maybe the initial assumption about the molecule's electron count is wrong. Let's try to think of the molecule as having 18 valence electrons and a 2:1 ratio, and Y = W + X.\n\nLet's consider W=O (8), X=O (8). But X must be higher than W. No. W=O (8), X=S (16). Y=8+16=24 (not short period). But if we ignore the short period constraint, Y=24 (Cr), but it's not a main group element. \n\nWait, let's try W=O (8), X=O (8), but same element. Invalid. \n\nWait, what if the molecule is something like O3, which has 18 valence electrons, but the atomic ratio is 3:0. Not 2:1. \n\nWait, let's try to think of a molecule with 18 valence electrons and 2:1 ratio. What about something like N2O? Valence electrons: 2*5 + 6 = 16. No. N2O3: 2*5 + 3*6 = 28. No. NO2: 5 + 2*6 = 17. Close. If there's a single electron, like NO2·, but it's an ion. \n\nWait, what about something like H2O with a charge? H2O^+ has 10 - 1 = 9 electrons. No. \n\nMaybe the molecule is something like C2H2 (acetylene): 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. No. \n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me try to look up common molecules with 18 valence electrons. SO2 has 18. Let's go with that. So W=O, X=S, but Y=8+16=24, which is not short period. But if we ignore that, let's see. Z has 1 valence electron, so if Y=24, Z would be in higher period, but not short. \n\nMaybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. Let's try to assume that Y is 15 (P), which is in period 3. Then W + X =15. Let's say W=7 (N), X=8 (O). Y=15 (P). Z has 1 valence electron, so Z could be K (19), but not short period. Or Na (11), but Y=15 > Z=11. Invalid. \n\nWait, if Z is in period 3, Group 1: Na (11), K is period 4. So Z=Na (11), but Y=15 > 11. Invalid. \n\nWait, what if Y is 14 (Si)? Then W + X =14. Let's say W=6 (C), X=8 (O). Y=14 (Si). Z must be >14, say 15 (P). P has 5 valence electrons. Not 1. \n\nThis is not working. Maybe the correct elements are W=O (8), X=O (8), Y=16 (S), Z=17 (Cl). But X must be higher than W. No. \n\nWait, let's try W=O (8), X=O (8), but same element. Invalid. \n\nMaybe the problem is designed with W=O, X=O, but that's not allowed. \n\nWait, let's try to think of W=O (8), X=O (8), but it's not possible. \n\nI think I need to make an educated guess based on the options provided. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA: Simple ionic radius: Z > X > Y. If Z is Na+, X is O^2-, Y is F-, then ionic radii: O^2- > F- > Na+. So if X is O, Y is F, Z is Na, then A would be Na+ > O^2- > F-? No, because O^2- is larger than F-. So if the order is Z (Na+) > X (O^2-), which is false. So A is likely incorrect.\n\nB: W and Y can form a compound with non-polar bonds. Non-polar bonds are like in diatomic molecules or symmetrical molecules. For example, O2, N2. If W and Y can form such a compound, like O2, but W and Y are different elements. If W is O and Y is O, but they are same. Not helpful. If W is H and Y is O, forming H2O which has polar bonds. Not sure.\n\nC: Boiling point of the simplest hydride of X and Y: X > Y. If X is O (H2O) and Y is S (H2S), then H2O has higher boiling point due to hydrogen bonding. But if X is O and Y is F (HF), then HF has higher boiling point than H2O? No, H2O has higher. Depends on the elements.\n\nD: Aqueous solution of compounds of W, X, Y shows acidity. For example, if the compound is H2SO4, which is acidic. But depends on the elements.\n\nGiven the previous analysis, the only plausible combination that fits Z having 1 valence electron is W=He, X=O, Y=Ne, Z=Na, but this leads to invalid compounds. However, let's assume that the correct elements are W=O, X=S, Y=24 (not short period), and Z=K (not short period), but this is invalid. \n\nWait, maybe the correct elements are W=O (8), X=O (8), Y=16 (S), Z=17 (Cl). But X must be higher than W. No. \n\nWait, let's try W=O (8), X=S (16), Y=24 (invalid), Z=K (19). Even though Y is not short period, let's see the options. If Y is S (16), then W + X =16. If W=8, X=8, invalid. If W=7 (N), X=9 (F), Y=16 (S). Then Z must be higher than 16, say 17 (Cl). Cl has 7 valence electrons, not 1. No. \n\nI think I have to make an assumption here. Let's go back to the initial assumption where W=O, X=S, Y=24 (even though it's not short period), and Z=K (19). Let's see the options:\n\nOption B: W and Y can form a compound with non-polar bonds. W=O, Y=24 (let's say Y is Cr, but it's not main group). Not helpful.\n\nOption C: Boiling point of hydrides. If X is S (H2S) and Y is some element, but Y is invalid. \n\nOption D: Aqueous solution shows acidity. If the compound is H2SO4, which is acidic. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible correct answer is B or C. Let's think about B: W and Y can form a compound with non-polar bonds. Non-polar bonds are in molecules like O2, N2, etc. If W is O and Y is O, but they are same. If W is O and Y is S, they form SO2, which is polar. Not non-polar. If W is N and Y is O, they form NO, which is polar. \n\nOption C: Boiling point of hydrides. If X is O (H2O) and Y is S (H2S), then H2O has higher boiling point. So if X is O and Y is S, then X > Y, which would make option C correct. But in this case, Y would be W + X =8 +16=24, which is not short period. But if we assume that Y is in period 3, like S (16), then W=8 (O), X=8 (O), but X must be higher. No. \n\nWait, if W=6 (C), X=8 (O), Y=14 (Si). Then Z must have 1 valence electron, like Na (11), but Y=14 > Z=11. Invalid. \n\nI think the correct answer is B or C. Given that, let's think about the options. If the correct elements are W=O, X=S, Y=24 (invalid), but assuming Y is S (16), then W + X=16. Let's say W=6 (C), X=10 (Ne). But Ne is noble gas. No. W=7 (N), X=9 (F). Y=16 (S). Z=17 (Cl). Cl has 7 valence electrons. Not 1. Invalid. \n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on common elements. Let's assume W=O (8), X=S (16), Y=24 (invalid), but let's proceed. If the compound of W, X, Y is something like H2SO4, which is acidic (option D). But since Y is not valid, this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, if the correct elements are W=O, X=O, Y=16 (S), Z=17 (Cl). Even though X is not higher than W, let's say it's a mistake. Then Z=Cl has 7 valence electrons, not 1. Invalid. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is B: W and Y can form a compound containing non-polar bonds. For example, if W is O and Y is O, but they are same. Or if W is H and Y is O, forming H2O which has polar bonds. Not sure. \n\nWait, let's think about the correct elements being W=O, X=S, Y=24 (invalid), but if we ignore that, and assume Y is S (16), then W=O (8), X=S (16), Y=24 (invalid). But if Y is S (16), then W + X =16. Let's say W=6 (C), X=10 (Ne). No. W=5 (B), X=11 (Na). But Na is Group 1, which could be Z. Let's say W=5 (B), X=11 (Na), Y=16 (S). Z must be higher than 16, say 17 (Cl). Cl has 7 valence electrons. Not 1. Invalid. \n\nI think I have to conclude that the correct answer is B or C, and given the options, let's go with B. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's look at the options again.\n\nOption B: W and Y can form a compound containing non-polar bonds. Non-polar bonds are in molecules like O2, N2, etc. If W and Y are the same element, but atomic numbers increase, so W and Y are different. If W is H and Y is Cl, they form HCl, which is polar. If W is C and Y is C, but Y has higher atomic number. Not possible. \n\nOption C: Boiling point of the simplest hydride of X and Y: X > Y. If X is O (H2O) and Y is S (H2S), then H2O has higher boiling point. So X > Y would be false. But if X is S (H2S) and Y is O (H2O), but X must have higher atomic number. So if X is S (16) and Y is O (8), but Y must have higher atomic number than X. No. \n\nWait, if Y has higher atomic number than X, then Y is below X in the periodic table. For example, if X is O (period 2), Y is S (period 3). Their hydrides: H2O and H2S. H2O has higher boiling point due to hydrogen bonding. So if the question says X > Y, it would be false. But if the hydride of Y has higher boiling point, then X < Y. But the option says X > Y, which would be incorrect. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: Aqueous solution of compounds composed of W, X, and Y all show acidity. For example, if the compound is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), which is acidic. But this depends on the elements. If W, X, Y are O, S, and another, then yes. But if the compound is something like H2O, it's neutral. So it depends.\n\nGiven all this confusion, and considering that the correct elements likely are W=O, X=S, Y=24 (invalid), but assuming Y is S (16), then the compound might be something like H2SO4, which is acidic (option D). But since Y is not valid, this is uncertain. \n\nGiven the options and the most plausible scenario, I think the correct answer is B: W and Y can form a compound containing non-polar bonds. For example, if W is O and Y is O, but they are same. Not possible. Alternatively, if W is C and Y is C, but same. Not possible. Maybe W is H and Y is H, but same. No. \n\nI'm really stuck. Let me try to recall that in such problems, common elements are often N, O, F, Cl, etc. Let's assume W=O (8), X=O (8), but invalid. W=O (8), X=O (8), Y=16 (S), Z=17 (Cl). Even though X is not higher, let's say it's a mistake. Then Z=Cl has 7 valence electrons, not 1. Invalid. \n\nWait, let's go back to the initial clue about Z having 1 valence electron. If Z is Na (11), and Y=10 (Ne), then W + X=10. Let's say W=2 (He), X=8 (O). Molecule is HeO2 (invalid), but let's proceed. The options: \n\nOption B: W (He) and Y (Ne) can form a compound with non-polar bonds. They don't form compounds, so B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Boiling point of hydrides. X=O (H2O) and Y=Ne (no hydride). Invalid.\n\nOption D: Compounds of W, X, Y (He, O, Ne) show acidity. No such compounds. Invalid.\n\nOption A: Ionic radius Z (Na+) > X (O^2-) > Y (Ne). Na+ has smaller radius than O^2- (since O^2- is isoelectronic with Ne, and Na+ is isoelectronic with Ne). So O^2- has larger radius than Na+. Y is Ne, which is a noble gas with larger atomic radius than Na+ but smaller than O^2-. So the order would be O^2- > Ne > Na+. But the option says Z > X > Y, which would be Na+ > O^2- > Y (Ne). This is incorrect. So A is wrong.\n\nSince all options seem incorrect, but the problem must have an answer, I must have made a mistake in determining the elements. Let me try one last time.\n\nLet's assume that the molecule with 18 valence electrons is SO2, with W=O (8), X=S (16), Y=24 (invalid), but let's ignore the period constraint. Z has 1 valence electron, so Z=K (19). Now, let's check the options:\n\nOption B: W (O) and Y (24, let's say Y is Cr) can form a compound with non-polar bonds. Unlikely.\n\nOption C: Boiling point of hydrides. X=O (H2O) and Y=Cr (no hydride). Invalid.\n\nOption D: Compounds of W, X, Y (O, S, Cr) show acidity. For example, H2SO4 is acidic. If the compound is H2SO4, then yes. So D might be correct.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given that, and considering that option D is about acidity, which is common for compounds like H2SO4, I'll go with D as the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the compounds composed of W, X, and Y all show acidity.\" If the compounds include something like H2O (water, neutral), then D is incorrect. But if the compounds are like H2SO4, which is acidic, then D could be correct. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, and considering common problems, the correct answer is likely B or D. Since I'm not sure, but in many such problems, the correct answer often relates to non-polar bonds or boiling points. Given that, and the fact that non-polar bonds can exist in diatomic molecules, but W and Y must be same element, which is not allowed, I'm forced to choose B or D. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of better options, I'll go with option B: W and Y can form a compound containing non-polar bonds. This might be a case where W and Y are the same element, but since atomic numbers are increasing, it's not possible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in determining the elements. \n\nWait, let's try W=O (8), X=O (8), Y=16 (S), Z=17 (Cl). Even though X is not higher than W, let's proceed. Then, W and Y are O and S. Can they form a compound with non-polar bonds? Like SO3? No, it's polar. SO2 is polar. O2 is non-polar, but that's W and W. Not W and Y. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is C: Boiling point of hydrides. If X is O (H2O) and Y is S (H2S), then H2O has higher boiling point, so X > Y, making option C correct. This is plausible. \n\nYes, if X is O and Y is S, then their hydrides are H2O and H2S. H2O has higher boiling point due to hydrogen bonding. So option C is correct. This would make sense if Y is S (16), W + X =16. Let's say W=8 (O), X=8 (O), but X must be higher. No. If W=7 (N), X=9 (F), Y=16 (S). Then Z must be higher than 16, say 17 (Cl). Cl has 7 valence electrons, not 1. But if we ignore that, then option C is correct. Given that, and the possibility that the problem has a typo or I missed something, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
