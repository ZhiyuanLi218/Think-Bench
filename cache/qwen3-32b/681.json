The charge per unit length is given as q/l, and the charge is uniformly distributed in a cylinder of radius R. Hmm, let me start by recalling some physics concepts related to magnetic fields and currents.\n\nFirst, I remember that a moving charge creates a magnetic field. Since this is a beam of particles, it's essentially a current. The magnetic field around a current-carrying cylinder... Wait, maybe I can model this as an infinite straight current-carrying cylinder? But since it's a particle beam, it's not a solid conductor. However, the charge is uniformly distributed within the cylinder, so maybe I can treat it similarly to a current-carrying wire with uniform current density?\n\nLet me think. The charge per unit length is given as q/l. Wait, usually charge per unit length is denoted as λ (lambda), so maybe I should note that λ = q/l here. But actually, the problem says \"charge per unit length of q/l\", so maybe that's just the definition. Let me confirm: if the charge per unit length is λ = q/l, then if we have a length l, the total charge is q. So that's the linear charge density.\n\nBut the beam is moving at speed v. So the current can be calculated from the charge per unit length and the velocity. How? Well, current is the rate at which charge passes through a cross-sectional area. For a beam moving with velocity v, the current I should be equal to the charge per unit length multiplied by the velocity, right? Because in one second, the particles move a distance v, so the charge passing through a cross-section per second would be λ*v. Therefore, I = λ*v.\n\nBut wait, let me check the units. Charge per unit length times velocity would be (C/m)*(m/s) = C/s, which is Ampere. Yes, that works. So I = λ*v.\n\nNow, if I can model this as an infinite cylinder carrying current I with uniform current density, then I can use Ampère's Law to find the magnetic field. But first, I need to figure out the current density. Wait, the problem says the charge is uniformly distributed within the cylinder. So the charge per unit volume would be ρ = λ / (πR²), since the charge per unit length is λ, and the cross-sectional area is πR². Therefore, ρ = λ / (πR²).\n\nBut since the particles are moving with speed v, the current density J would be ρ*v. Let me verify: current density J is charge per unit area per unit time, which is (charge per unit volume) times velocity. So J = ρ*v. Therefore, J = (λ / (πR²)) * v.\n\nAlternatively, since we already have I = λ*v, and for a cylinder of radius R, the total current I is also equal to J times the cross-sectional area πR². Let me check that:\n\nI = J * πR² = (λ / πR² * v) * πR² = λ*v. Yep, that works. So both approaches are consistent.\n\nNow, to find the magnetic field B using Ampère's Law. Ampère's Law states that the closed loop integral of B·dl equals μ₀ times the enclosed current I_enc.\n\nFor an infinite cylindrical symmetry, we can choose an Amperian loop that's a circle concentric with the cylinder. The magnetic field should be tangential and have the same magnitude at every point on the loop due to symmetry.\n\nSo, let's consider two regions: inside the cylinder (r < R) and outside the cylinder (r ≥ R).\n\nFirst, let me find the total current enclosed in each region.\n\nStarting with outside the cylinder (r ≥ R). In this case, the entire current of the beam is enclosed. Since the beam is a cylinder of radius R, any Amperian loop outside of it encloses all the current. Therefore, I_enc = I_total = λ*v.\n\nApplying Ampère's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enc => B = (μ₀ * I_enc) / (2πr) = (μ₀ * λ * v) / (2πr).\n\nSo that's the magnetic field outside the cylinder.\n\nNow, inside the cylinder (r < R). Here, the enclosed current is not the total current, but only the current within the radius r. Since the current is uniformly distributed, the enclosed current I_enc is proportional to the area.\n\nThe total current I_total = J * πR², and the current enclosed within radius r is I_enc = J * πr². Therefore:\n\nI_enc = I_total * (r² / R²) = λ*v * (r² / R²).\n\nAlternatively, since J = λ*v / πR², then I_enc = J * πr² = (λ*v / πR²) * πr² = λ*v*(r²/R²). Same result.\n\nTherefore, applying Ampère's Law again:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enc = μ₀ * λ*v*(r²/R²)\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = [μ₀ * λ*v*(r²/R²)] / (2πr) ) = [μ₀ * λ*v*r] / (2πR²)\n\nSo inside the cylinder, the magnetic field increases linearly with r, while outside it decreases with 1/r, similar to a straight infinite wire.\n\nBut let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me recap:\n\n- Calculated current I_total = λ*v. Correct.\n\n- For inside the cylinder, found that I_enc = I_total*(r²/R²). Since current density is uniform, yes, the enclosed current scales with area. Correct.\n\n- Applied Ampère's Law for both regions. The symmetry suggests that B is tangential and constant in magnitude around the loop. Correct.\n\nSo the magnetic field is:\n\nFor r ≥ R: B = (μ₀ * λ * v) / (2πr)\n\nFor r < R: B = (μ₀ * λ * v * r) / (2πR²)\n\nBut let me think again about the charge distribution. The problem says it's a particle beam. Are we assuming that the particles are moving along the axis of the cylinder? That is, the velocity v is along the axis of the cylinder? Yes, otherwise the problem wouldn't have cylindrical symmetry. So assuming that all particles are moving parallel to the cylinder axis with speed v, uniformly distributed.\n\nAnother thing to consider: is the charge positive or negative? Well, since it's a particle beam, it could be either, but the direction of the magnetic field would depend on the sign. However, since the problem asks for the magnitude and direction? Wait, the problem says \"determine the magnetic field B in the entire space\". It doesn't specify direction, but since it's a vector, maybe I need to express it in terms of direction as well.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify the direction of velocity, perhaps we can assume it's along the +z-axis, and then express the magnetic field direction using the right-hand rule. For a positive charge moving along +z, the magnetic field circulates around the cylinder in the direction given by the right-hand rule. If the charges are negative (e.g., electrons), the direction would be opposite. However, since the problem mentions a \"charged particle beam\" without specifying, but since they gave charge per unit length as q/l, we can assume that q is the total charge, so if it's positive, then the direction is as per right-hand rule.\n\nBut since the problem says \"determine the magnetic field B\", and in physics notation, B is a vector. However, the problem might be expecting the magnitude and direction in terms of variables. However, since the problem is stated in general terms, perhaps we can express the answer in terms of direction using cylindrical coordinates or something.\n\nBut maybe the problem is expecting just the magnitude, expressed as above, with direction given by the right-hand rule around the cylinder. However, since the user might expect a vector expression, but given that the problem says \"determine the magnetic field B in the entire space\", and given that the original problem statement is in terms of variables, perhaps we can express it using unit vectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the magnitude, as direction can be inferred from the right-hand rule. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says \"Determine the magnetic field B in the entire space.\" So they want the vector field, but since it's symmetric, we can express it in cylindrical coordinates where B is azimuthal. Let me try to write it properly.\n\nIn cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z), with the beam moving along the z-axis. Then, the magnetic field would be in the φ direction. So:\n\nFor r < R:\n\nB = [ (μ₀ * λ * v ) / (2π R²) ] * r * \\hat{φ}\n\nFor r ≥ R:\n\nB = [ (μ₀ * λ * v ) / (2π r ) ] * \\hat{φ}\n\nBut maybe we can write it in terms of the permeability constant μ₀, and using the given variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there's another way to express λ in terms of other variables. The problem states that the charge per unit length is q/l. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"a charge per unit length of q/l\". Is that supposed to be λ = q/l? But if so, then q and l are total charge and total length? But in that case, if the beam is infinite, then l would be infinite? Wait, but in reality, a particle beam is not infinite, but for the purpose of this problem, since we are considering an infinite cylinder (because otherwise the magnetic field calculation would be more complicated), we can assume that the beam is infinitely long. Therefore, the charge per unit length λ is given as q/l, but if it's infinite, then perhaps q and l are just parameters? Wait, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem says \"a uniformly charged particle beam moving at a speed v has a charge per unit length of q/l\". Wait, q/l is charge per unit length? That would mean that if you take a length l of the beam, it has charge q. Therefore, λ = q/l. However, if the beam is infinite, then the total charge is infinite, but the charge per unit length is finite. So in that case, λ is just a constant, given as q/l. So maybe the problem uses q/l to denote the linear charge density λ. Therefore, we can just use λ = q/l in our formulas.\n\nTherefore, substituting back, the magnetic field expressions are as above.\n\nBut let me check again with another approach. Let me think about the current density.\n\nThe charge per unit volume is ρ = λ / (πR²). The current density J is ρ*v, so J = (λ / πR²) * v.\n\nFor Ampère's Law, inside the cylinder, the enclosed current is J times the area of the circle with radius r:\n\nI_enc = J * πr² = (λ v / π R²) * π r² = λ v r² / R². Which matches what I had before.\n\nTherefore, Ampère's Law gives B*2πr = μ₀ I_enc, so B inside is μ₀ λ v r / (2π R²).\n\nOutside, I_enc is λ v, so B outside is μ₀ λ v / (2π r).\n\nTherefore, the expressions are correct.\n\nBut let me check with another example. For a straight infinite wire with current I, the magnetic field outside is μ₀ I / (2π r), and inside, if it's a solid cylinder with uniform current density, then inside it's (μ₀ I r)/(2π R²) * π R² / π r² ??? Wait, no. Wait, for a solid cylinder with total current I, the current density is J = I / (π R²). Then, inside at radius r, the enclosed current is J * π r² = I r² / R². Then Ampère's Law gives B*2πr = μ₀ I_enc => B = μ₀ I r / (2π R²) * ?\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nInside the cylinder (r ≤ R):\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * (I * (r²/R²)) => B = (μ₀ I r ) / (2π R² )\n\nBut since I here is the total current. Wait, but in our case, the total current is I_total = λ v. Therefore, substituting I = λ v, we get:\n\nInside: B = (μ₀ λ v r ) / (2π R² )\n\nOutside: B = μ₀ λ v / (2π r )\n\nWhich matches our previous result. Therefore, yes, this is consistent with the standard infinite cylinder current case.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field is as derived.\n\nBut let me think again about the charge distribution. The problem says it's a particle beam. If it's a beam of charged particles, are there any other factors to consider? For example, in a real particle beam, there might be space charge effects, but since the problem states that the charge is uniformly distributed, we can assume that it's a steady current, so the usual magnetostatics applies. So we don't have to worry about electromagnetic radiation or anything like that.\n\nAlso, since the particles are moving at speed v, we need to make sure that the current is steady. If the beam is steady, then yes, the current is constant in time, so magnetostatics applies.\n\nTherefore, the approach is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nFor r ≤ R: B(r) = (μ₀ λ v r) / (2π R²) in the azimuthal direction.\n\nFor r ≥ R: B(r) = (μ₀ λ v) / (2π r) in the azimuthal direction.\n\nExpressed in terms of the given variables, where λ = q/l.\n\nBut let me check if the problem wants the answer expressed in terms of q and l or if λ is acceptable. The problem says \"charge per unit length of q/l\", so probably they want the answer expressed using q/l instead of λ. Let me substitute λ = q/l into the equations.\n\nTherefore:\n\nInside (r ≤ R):\n\nB = [μ₀ (q/l) v r ] / (2π R² ) = (μ₀ q v r ) / (2π l R² )\n\nOutside (r ≥ R):\n\nB = [μ₀ (q/l) v ] / (2π r ) = (μ₀ q v ) / (2π l r )\n\nBut wait, hold on. If λ = q/l, then q is the total charge on a length l of the beam. However, if the beam is infinitely long, then l is arbitrary? Wait, no. Actually, λ is charge per unit length, so if you have a length l, the total charge is q = λ l. Therefore, if the problem defines λ as q/l, then λ is the linear charge density. Therefore, expressing the answer in terms of λ is acceptable. However, if the problem expects the answer in terms of q and l, then we need to be careful.\n\nBut since the beam is infinite, l is not a specific length but rather a parameter used to define λ. Therefore, I think expressing the answer in terms of λ is better, as q and l are not clearly defined for an infinite beam. For example, if you take a finite length l, then the total charge is q, but for an infinite beam, you can't really define total charge. Hence, the problem uses q/l to define the linear charge density λ. Therefore, the answer should be expressed in terms of λ, which is given as q/l. Therefore, writing B in terms of λ is acceptable.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the given variables q/l. Let me check the problem statement again: \"a charge per unit length of q/l, with the charge uniformly distributed within a cylinder of radius R\". Therefore, they define the linear charge density as q/l. Therefore, if we write B in terms of q/l, that would be appropriate.\n\nBut in the expressions above, we have λ = q/l. Therefore, substituting:\n\nInside:\n\nB = [μ₀ (q/l) v r ] / (2π R² )\n\nOutside:\n\nB = [μ₀ (q/l) v ] / (2π r )\n\nTherefore, the final expressions are:\n\nFor r ≤ R:\n\nB = (μ₀ q v r ) / (2π l R² )\n\nFor r ≥ R:\n\nB = (μ₀ q v ) / (2π l r )\n\nBut I need to make sure that the units are correct. Let me check the units for inside:\n\nμ₀ has units of T·m/A.\n\nq is charge (C), v is m/s, r is m, l is m, R is m.\n\nSo numerator: T·m/A * C * m/s * m = T·m/A * C·m²/s\n\nDenominator: m² (from l*R²). Wait:\n\nInside expression:\n\n(μ₀ q v r ) / (2π l R² )\n\nUnits:\n\n[ (T·m/A) * C * (m/s) * m ] / [m * m² ] = [ T·m/A * C·m²/s ] / [m³ ] = T·C/(A·s) * m^(-something?)\n\nWait, let me recall that 1 T = 1 N/(A·m). Also, 1 C/s = 1 A. Therefore, let's substitute:\n\nT·C/(A·s) = (N/(A·m)) * C/(A) = N·C/(A²·m). Hmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's track the units step by step.\n\nμ₀ has units H/m (henrys per meter). 1 H = 1 Wb/A = 1 (T·m²)/A. Therefore, μ₀ has units (T·m²)/(A·m) ) = T·m/A.\n\nSo μ₀ [T·m/A] * q [C] * v [m/s] * r [m] divided by l [m] * R² [m²].\n\nSo overall:\n\n(T·m/A) * C * m/s * m / (m * m²) ) = T·C·m²/(A·s·m⁴) ) = T·C/(A·s·m²).\n\nBut since current is charge per unit time, I (A) = C/s. Therefore, T·(C/(A·s))·1/m² = T·(1/A)·(A/s)/s · 1/m² ??? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, if I have T·C/(A·s·m²). Since C/s is A, this becomes T·A/(A·m²) ) = T/m². Wait, but magnetic field B should have units of T. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait, there must be a miscalculation. Let me recast.\n\nOriginal expression for B inside:\n\nB = [μ₀ * (q/l) * v * r ] / (2π R² )\n\nLet me check units:\n\nμ₀: T·m/A\n\n(q/l): C/m\n\nv: m/s\n\nr: m\n\nDivide by R²: m²\n\nSo overall:\n\n(T·m/A) * (C/m) * (m/s) * m / m² = T·m/A * C/(m * s) * m² / m² ?\n\nWait:\n\nMultiply μ₀ (T·m/A) by (q/l) (C/m) gives T·m/A * C/m = T·C/(A·m²)\n\nMultiply by v (m/s): T·C/(A·m²) * m/s = T·C/(A·m·s)\n\nMultiply by r (m): T·C/(A·s) * m/m = T·C/(A·s)\n\nDivide by R² (m²): Wait no, the R² is already in the denominator from the start? Wait no, the expression is:\n\n[μ₀ * (q/l) * v * r ] / (2π R² )\n\nSo after multiplying μ₀*(q/l)*v*r, we have T·C/(A·s), and then dividing by R² (m²):\n\nSo units become T·C/(A·s·m²). But since C/s is A, this is T·A/(A·m²) ) = T/m². Wait, but B should have units of T. So there is a discrepancy here. Which suggests an error in my derivation.\n\nWait, this is concerning. Let me check again.\n\nLet me start from the expression for B inside the cylinder:\n\nB = μ₀ I_enc / (2π r)\n\nWhere I_enc = λ v (r²/R²)\n\nBut λ is charge per unit length, which is C/m.\n\nTherefore, I_enc has units (C/m)*(m/s)*(dimensionless) = C/s = A. Correct.\n\nTherefore, μ₀ I_enc has units (T·m/A)*A = T·m.\n\nDivide by 2π r (units m):\n\nT·m / m = T. Correct. Therefore, B has units of T. So the units are okay.\n\nBut when I tried substituting λ = q/l, I must have messed up the units.\n\nLet me check again with substitution.\n\nOriginal expression inside:\n\nB = [μ₀ * λ * v * r ] / (2π R² )\n\nλ is C/m.\n\nv is m/s.\n\nr is m.\n\nR is m.\n\nSo units:\n\n(T·m/A) * (C/m) * (m/s) * m / m² = T·m/A * C/(m * s) * m² / m² ?\n\nWait:\n\n(T·m/A) * (C/m) * (m/s) * m / m²\n\nSimplify step by step:\n\nFirst, T·m/A * C/m = T·C/(A·m²)\n\nMultiply by m/s: T·C/(A·m²) * m/s = T·C/(A·m·s)\n\nMultiply by m: T·C/(A·s·m) * m = T·C/(A·s)\n\nDivide by m²: T·C/(A·s·m²)\n\nBut T·C/(A·s·m²). Since C/s = A, then T·A/(A·m²) ) = T/m². Wait, but this contradicts the previous conclusion.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the expression, it's divided by R², which is m². But where is that division?\n\nWait, the expression is [μ₀ * λ * v * r ] divided by (2π R²). So after multiplying μ₀*λ*v*r, which has units T·C/(A·s), then dividing by R² (m²) gives T·C/(A·s·m²). But since C/s is A, then T·A/(A·m²) = T/m². But this is not T. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, no. Let me track again:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nB = [μ₀ * λ * v * r ] / (2π R² )\n\nμ₀ has units H/m = T·m/A.\n\nλ is C/m.\n\nv is m/s.\n\nr is m.\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n(T·m/A) * (C/m) * (m/s) * m = T·m/A * C/m * m²/s = T·m/A * C/s = T·m/A * A (since C/s is A) = T·m.\n\nThen divide by R², which is m²:\n\nT·m / m² = T/m. Wait, now it's T/m? But B should have units of T. So there is a problem here.\n\nThis suggests that my derivation is wrong. But earlier when I considered I_enc, the units worked out. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me recast the expression for B inside:\n\nFrom Ampère's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enc\n\nTherefore, B = μ₀ * I_enc / (2πr)\n\nI_enc = λ * v * (r²/R²)\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nB = μ₀ * λ * v * r² / (R² * 2πr ) = μ₀ * λ * v * r / (2π R² )\n\nTherefore, B = [μ₀ λ v r ] / [ 2π R² ]\n\nSo units:\n\nμ₀ [T·m/A] * λ [C/m] * v [m/s] * r [m] / [ R² [m²] ]\n\nSo:\n\nT·m/A * C/m * m/s * m / m² = T·m/A * C/(m·s) * m² / m² ?\n\nWait:\n\nMultiply T·m/A * C/m = T·C/(A·m²)\n\nMultiply by v (m/s): T·C/(A·m²) * m/s = T·C/(A·m·s)\n\nMultiply by r (m): T·C/(A·s) * m/m = T·C/(A·s)\n\nDivide by R² (m²): Wait no, the R² is already in the denominator. Wait, the full calculation is:\n\nNumerator: μ₀ * λ * v * r has units T·m/A * C/m * m/s * m = T·m/A * C/s * m = T·m/A * A * m = T·m²/A\n\nDenominator: 2π R² has units m²\n\nTherefore, overall units: (T·m²/A) / m² = T / A * A? Wait no:\n\nWait, μ₀ has units T·m/A. Then multiplying by λ (C/m), v (m/s), and r (m):\n\n(T·m/A) * (C/m) * (m/s) * m = T·m/A * C/s * m. Wait, C/s is A, so T·m/A * A * m = T·m² / A * A? No:\n\nWait, step by step:\n\n(T·m/A) * (C/m) = T·C/(A·m²)\n\nMultiply by (m/s): T·C/(A·m²) * m/s = T·C/(A·m·s)\n\nMultiply by m: T·C/(A·s)\n\nNow divide by R² (m²):\n\nWait, no. The entire expression is [μ₀ * λ * v * r ] / [ 2π R² ]\n\nSo after getting to T·C/(A·s), divide by R² (m²)? No, the previous step was already divided by 2π R². Wait, no, the R² is in the denominator from the formula. Let me recast:\n\nThe formula is:\n\nB = [μ₀ * λ * v * r ] / [ 2π R² ]\n\nSo after calculating the numerator as T·C/(A·s), then dividing by m² (R²) gives T·C/(A·s·m²). But since C/s is A, this is T·A/(A·m²) = T/m². But that's not T. So something is wrong here. But earlier, when I considered B = μ₀ I_enc / (2π r), the units worked out. What is the problem?\n\nWait, let me check B = μ₀ I_enc / (2π r). I_enc is in A, μ₀ is T·m/A, so μ₀ I_enc is T·m, divided by r (m) gives T. Correct. So why when I express I_enc in terms of λ, v, r, R, the units don't match? There must be an error in substitution.\n\nWait, I_enc = λ * v * (r²/R²). Let's check the units of I_enc:\n\nλ is C/m, v is m/s, so λ*v is C/(m·s) * m/s? No, λ*v is (C/m)*(m/s) = C/s = A. Then multiplied by (r²/R²), which is dimensionless. Therefore, I_enc has units A. Correct. Therefore, μ₀ I_enc / (2π r) has units (T·m/A * A)/m = T·m/m = T. Correct.\n\nBut when I write I_enc = λ*v*r²/R², then substituting into B gives B = μ₀ * λ * v * r² / (R² * 2π r) ) = μ₀ * λ * v * r / (2π R² )\n\nSo why does the unit analysis give T/m? Because I must have made a mistake in the unit calculation earlier.\n\nLet me recast:\n\nμ₀ [T·m/A] * λ [C/m] * v [m/s] * r [m] / [ R² [m²] * 2π ]\n\nSo numerator units:\n\nT·m/A * C/m * m/s * m = T·m/A * C/s * m = T·m/A * A * m = T·m² / A * A? Wait:\n\nWait, C/s is A, so T·m/A * A * m = T·m * m = T·m². Then divide by R² (m²): T·m² / m² = T. Correct! There we go. Earlier I must have messed up the cancellation. So the units are correct. Phew!\n\nSo the unit analysis works out. So no problem. My earlier confusion was due to a miscalculation. So the expressions are correct.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field expressions are correct.\n\nSo to write the final answer:\n\nInside the cylinder (r ≤ R):\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ * (q/l) * v * r ) / (2π R² ) in the azimuthal direction.\n\nOutside the cylinder (r ≥ R):\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ * (q/l) * v ) / (2π r ) in the azimuthal direction.\n\nExpressed in vector form, using cylindrical coordinates where the beam is along the z-axis, the magnetic field is in the φ direction. So:\n\nFor r ≤ R:\n\n\\boldsymbol{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0 (q/l) v r}{2\\pi R^2} \\, \\hat{\\phi}\n\nFor r ≥ R:\n\n\\boldsymbol{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0 (q/l) v}{2\\pi r} \\, \\hat{\\phi}\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it in terms of λ = q/l:\n\nInside:\n\n\\boldsymbol{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\lambda v r}{2\\pi R^2} \\, \\hat{\\phi}\n\nOutside:\n\n\\boldsymbol{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\lambda v}{2\\pi r} \\, \\hat{\\phi}\n\nBut since the problem defines λ as q/l, both forms are acceptable. However, since the problem statement uses q/l, it might be preferable to present the answer in terms of q/l as given.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field in the entire space is as derived above.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize that the moving charged particle beam constitutes a current.\n\n2. Calculate the total current I = λv, where λ is the charge per unit length.\n\n3. Use Ampère's Law for an infinite cylinder with uniform current density.\n\n4. For points inside the cylinder, calculate the enclosed current proportional to r², leading to a linear dependence of B on r.\n\n5. For points outside, the enclosed current is the total current, leading to B decreasing with 1/r.\n\n6. Verify the units to ensure consistency.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is as derived.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B}(r) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mu_0 q v r}{2\\pi l R^2} \\, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} & \\text{for } r \\leq R, \\\\\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mu_0 q v}{2\\pi l r} \\, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} & \\text{for } r \\geq R.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nOr, expressed in terms of $\\lambda = \\frac{q}{l}$,\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B}(r) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mu_0 \\lambda v r}{2\\pi R^2} \\, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} & \\text{for } r \\leq R, \\\\\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mu_0 \\lambda v}{2\\pi r} \\, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} & \\text{for } r \\geq R.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThus, the magnetic field in the entire space is \\boxed{\\boldsymbol{B}(r)} as defined above.\n</think>"}
