Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: Adding zinc powder to copper sulfate solution. I remember that copper sulfate is blue, and when you add a more reactive metal like zinc, it should displace the copper. The reaction is Zn + CuSO4 → Cu + ZnSO4. Copper metal is reddish, so it would precipitate out, and zinc sulfate solution is colorless. So the blue color disappears because the Cu²+ ions are being converted to solid copper. That seems correct. So A is probably okay.\n\nOption B: Clear lime water (calcium hydroxide solution) left standing forms a white solid. The equation given is Ca(OH)2 + CO2 → CaCO3↓ + H2O. I know that when lime water is exposed to air, it reacts with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate, which is a white precipitate. This is a common test for CO2. So the color change from clear to white solid is correct. So B looks right.\n\nOption C: Sodium peroxide (Na2O2) left in the air turns from pale yellow to white. The equation is 2Na2O2 → 2Na2O + O2↑. Sodium peroxide is indeed pale yellow. If it decomposes into sodium oxide (Na2O), which is white, then the color change makes sense. But wait, does Na2O2 actually decompose like this when left in the air? I think sodium peroxide is stable in air unless it's reacting with water or carbon dioxide. Maybe it reacts with moisture or CO2 in the air to form other products. Alternatively, maybe it decomposes into Na2O and O2. Let me think. Sodium peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent. If it decomposes, the products would be sodium oxide and oxygen. However, sodium oxide is white, so the pale yellow Na2O2 turning white would be correct. But is this the actual reaction? Or does Na2O2 react with something else in the air? For example, it might absorb CO2 and water to form sodium carbonate and oxygen. Let me check the possible reactions. If Na2O2 is left in the air, it might react with CO2: 2Na2O2 + 2CO2 → 2Na2CO3 + O2. In that case, the color change would still be from pale yellow to white (sodium carbonate is white), but the equation given is different. The given equation is decomposition into Na2O and O2. So if the actual reaction is with CO2 and water, then the equation in option C is not correct. Therefore, maybe option C is incorrect. But I need to be sure. Let me recall: sodium peroxide is Na2O2, which is a yellow solid. If it's left in the air, it will react with moisture and CO2. The main product would be sodium carbonate, not sodium oxide. So the equation given in option C is wrong because the product is Na2O, but in reality, it would form Na2CO3. Therefore, the color change is correct (from yellow to white), but the equation is incorrect. Therefore, option C is the wrong equation. So the answer would be C.\n\nOption D: Adding FeCl3 solution to Mg(OH)2 suspension results in reddish-brown precipitate. The equation is 3Mg(OH)2 + 2FeCl3 → ... Well, the products would be Fe(OH)3 and MgCl2. Let me balance it. The reaction is a double displacement: Mg(OH)2 + FeCl3 → Fe(OH)3 + MgCl2. To balance, we need 3 Mg(OH)2 and 2 FeCl3 to get 2 Fe(OH)3 and 3 MgCl2. So the balanced equation is 3Mg(OH)2 + 2FeCl3 → 2Fe(OH)3↓ + 3MgCl2. Now, Fe(OH)3 is a reddish-brown precipitate. So the color change from Mg(OH)2 (which is white) to reddish-brown Fe(OH)3 is correct. Therefore, the equation in D is correct, assuming the products are Fe(OH)3 and MgCl2. The user's option D is cut off, but the equation as written probably is correct. So D is okay.\n\nSo the incorrect one is option C. The equation given for C is decomposition of Na2O2 into Na2O and O2, but in reality, when left in air, Na2O2 would react with CO2 and water to form Na2CO3 and O2. So the equation in C is wrong, even though the color change is described correctly. Therefore, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
