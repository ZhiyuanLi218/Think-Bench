Both are Eddington limited. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what Eddington limit means. The Eddington luminosity is the maximum luminosity a star (or in this case, an accreting black hole) can achieve where the outward radiation pressure balances the inward gravitational pull. If the accretion is Eddington limited, that means the luminosity is at or near the Eddington limit.\n\nSo, the Eddington luminosity formula is L_Edd = (4πG M m_p c)/σ_T, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the black hole mass, m_p is the proton mass, c is the speed of light, and σ_T is the Thomson scattering cross-section. Alternatively, I remember there's a commonly used formula for Eddington luminosity in terms of the black hole mass. Let me check. Yes, the Eddington luminosity is often written as L_Edd ≈ 1.3×10^31 (M/M☉) erg/s, where M is the black hole mass in solar masses. But I need to make sure of the exact expression.\n\nAlternatively, since we are dealing with fluxes, and we want to relate them to luminosity, and then to the mass via the Eddington limit. The flux F is related to luminosity L by F = L / (4πd²), where d is the distance to the source. Therefore, if I can find the luminosities of the two quasars, I can then relate them to their respective Eddington luminosities and thus find the ratio of their black hole masses.\n\nBut first, I need to calculate the luminosities. To do that, I need the distance to each quasar. Since they are observed at different redshifts, z=0.06 and z=0.02, I need to find the luminosity distance for each. However, redshifts are small here (z=0.02 and 0.06, which are less than 0.1), so maybe I can use the approximation for luminosity distance in the low redshift regime. For small z, the luminosity distance d_L ≈ (c z)/H₀, where H₀ is the Hubble constant. But wait, is that correct?\n\nActually, the luminosity distance in a flat universe (which is a common assumption if we don't have more information) is given by d_L = (1+z) * r, where r is the comoving distance. For small z, the comoving distance can be approximated as r ≈ (c/H₀) * z. So combining these, d_L ≈ (1+z)(c z / H₀). However, if z is small, then (1+z) ≈ 1, so d_L ≈ c z / H₀. But I need to check if this is the right approach here.\n\nAlternatively, for very small redshifts, the luminosity distance is approximately equal to the proper distance, which is d ≈ cz/H₀. So maybe for z=0.02 and 0.06, which are small, we can use that approximation. However, I need to confirm the exact formula. Let me recall that in general, the luminosity distance is d_L = (1+z) * r, where r is the comoving distance. For small z, the comoving distance r ≈ ∫₀^z c/H(z') dz'. If we assume a matter-dominated universe with H(z) = H₀√(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ)), but if we take the standard ΛCDM model with Ω_m ≈ 0.3 and Ω_Λ ≈ 0.7, but given that z is small, the expansion can be approximated as H(z) ≈ H₀(1 + (3/2)Ω_m z). However, this might complicate things. Alternatively, if we assume that the universe is matter-dominated (which it's not exactly, but for small z maybe), then H(z) = H₀(1+z)^(3/2). But again, for very small z, maybe we can approximate r ≈ (c/H₀) z. Therefore, d_L ≈ (1+z)(c z / H₀). Since z is small, (1+z) ≈ 1 + z. Therefore, d_L ≈ c z / H₀ * (1 + z). For z=0.02 and 0.06, the correction from (1+z) is about 2% and 6%, which might be negligible if we are only looking for an approximate answer. However, since the question is from a textbook or exam, perhaps they expect using the simple d_L ≈ c z / H₀. But maybe they want us to use cosmological calculators or specific formulas. Wait, but since we don't have values for H₀, maybe we can assume that H₀ is the same for both quasars, and so when we take the ratio of their luminosities, the H₀ terms will cancel out? Let's see.\n\nLet me write down the luminosity L = 4π d_L² F. So for Quasar A, L_A = 4π d_A² F_A, and for Quasar B, L_B = 4π d_B² F_B. The ratio L_A / L_B = (d_A / d_B)² * (F_A / F_B). But since d_L for each is proportional to z (if we use the approximation d_L ≈ c z / H₀), then d_A / d_B ≈ z_A / z_B. Therefore, L_A / L_B ≈ (z_A / z_B)² * (F_A / F_B). Then, since each quasar is Eddington limited, their luminosities are equal to their Eddington luminosities. Therefore, L_A = L_Edd,A = (constant) * M_A, and similarly for B. Therefore, L_A / L_B = M_A / M_B. Hence, M_A / M_B = (z_A / z_B)² * (F_A / F_B).\n\nWait, let me check the constants. The Eddington luminosity is L_Edd = (4π G M m_p c)/σ_T. Therefore, if we assume that each quasar is at its Eddington luminosity, then L = L_Edd, so M = L σ_T / (4π G m_p c). Therefore, M_A / M_B = (L_A / L_B) * (σ_T / (4π G m_p c)) / (σ_T / (4π G m_p c)) ) = L_A / L_B. So yes, the ratio of masses is equal to the ratio of luminosities. Therefore, if I can find L_A / L_B, that will be equal to M_A / M_B.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if L_A / L_B ≈ (z_A / z_B)² * (F_A / F_B), then M_A / M_B ≈ same thing. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven: z_A = 0.06, z_B = 0.02, F_A = 1e-25 W/m², F_B = 1e-24 W/m².\n\nTherefore, z_A/z_B = 0.06 / 0.02 = 3. So squared is 9. F_A / F_B = (1e-25) / (1e-24) = 0.1. Therefore, multiplying 9 * 0.1 = 0.9. Therefore, M_A / M_B = 0.9. So the answer is D: 0.9.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is this correct? Because I made an approximation that d_L ≈ c z / H₀. However, the exact luminosity distance depends on the cosmology. However, since both quasars are at small z, and assuming the same cosmology, when taking the ratio, maybe the H₀ cancels? Let me re-express.\n\nLet me write the luminosity distance more precisely. In general, d_L = (1+z) * r, where r is the comoving distance. For small z, r ≈ ∫₀^z c / [H₀ √(Ω_r (1+z')^4 + Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_k (1+z')² + Ω_Λ)] ] dz'\n\nBut for small z, and assuming Ω_r ≈ 0 (negligible radiation), and Ω_k ≈ 0 (flat universe), then H(z) ≈ H₀ [Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ]^{1/2}. However, for small z, (1+z)^3 ≈ 1 + 3z, so if Ω_Λ is non-zero, this complicates things. However, if we take a simple Hubble law approximation for small z, where d_L ≈ (c/H₀) z, then the ratio d_A / d_B ≈ z_A / z_B. However, if we take into account the (1+z) factor in d_L, then d_L ≈ (1+z)(c z / H₀). Therefore, for small z, the (1+z) ≈ 1 + z. Therefore, d_L ≈ c z / H₀ * (1 + z). Therefore, for Quasar A, d_A ≈ (c z_A / H₀)(1 + z_A), and for Quasar B, d_B ≈ (c z_B / H₀)(1 + z_B). Therefore, the ratio of luminosities would be [d_A² / d_B²] * [F_A / F_B] = [(z_A / z_B)² * ((1 + z_A)/(1 + z_B))²] * [F_A / F_B]. Given that z_A = 0.06 and z_B = 0.02, then (1 + z_A) ≈ 1.06 and (1 + z_B) ≈ 1.02. Therefore, ((1.06)/(1.02))² ≈ (1.0392)² ≈ 1.08. Therefore, multiplying that by the previous 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 gives 0.9 * 1.08 ≈ 0.97. However, the answer options are 0.3, 0.1, 0.7, 0.9. So 0.97 is close to 0.9, which is option D. Therefore, perhaps the question expects us to neglect the (1+z) factor, and just take d_L ≈ c z / H₀. Hence, leading to 0.9 as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another consideration. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says \"Assume that the accretion of their central black hole is Eddington limited.\" So that means that the luminosity of each quasar is equal to the Eddington luminosity. Therefore, L = L_Edd = (4π G M c σ_T)/(m_p σ_T)? Wait, no, let me get the Eddington luminosity formula right.\n\nThe Eddington luminosity is given by L_Edd = (4π G M m_p c)/σ_T. Therefore, solving for M gives M = L_Edd σ_T / (4π G m_p c). Therefore, if both quasars are at their Eddington luminosities, then their masses are proportional to their luminosities. Therefore, M_A / M_B = L_A / L_B.\n\nSo, if I can compute L_A / L_B, that ratio is equal to M_A / M_B.\n\nNow, Luminosity L = 4π d_L² F. Therefore, L_A / L_B = (d_L,A / d_L,B)² * (F_A / F_B).\n\nNow, the question is, what is d_L,A / d_L,B?\n\nIf we use the approximation for small z, assuming a matter-dominated universe, but even better, using the standard cosmology, but since the redshifts are small, maybe we can approximate.\n\nIn general, luminosity distance in terms of redshift for small z can be approximated as:\n\nd_L ≈ (c/H₀) * z * (1 + (1/2)(1 - q₀) z )\n\nwhere q₀ is the deceleration parameter. However, without knowing q₀, this complicates. However, if we take a simple Hubble law, d_L ≈ (c z)/H₀, which is the approximation for very small z in a universe with q₀=0.5 (matter-dominated). However, given that the problem is likely intended for an introductory astrophysics course, perhaps they expect using d_L ≈ (c z)/H₀.\n\nTherefore, assuming that, then d_L,A / d_L,B ≈ z_A / z_B = 0.06 / 0.02 = 3. Therefore, (d_L,A / d_L,B)² = 9. Then, L_A / L_B = 9 * (F_A / F_B) = 9 * (1e-25 / 1e-24) = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9. Therefore, M_A / M_B = 0.9. Hence, answer D.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Is the bolometric flux given in the problem the observed flux, which would need to be corrected for redshift? Wait, the bolometric flux is the total flux received, accounting for all wavelengths. However, when considering luminosity distance, the flux is related to the intrinsic luminosity by F = L / (4π d_L²). However, in reality, there is also a redshift effect on the flux. Wait, no, the luminosity distance already incorporates the redshift effects. The formula F = L / (4π d_L²) is correct in the context of cosmological distances, where d_L is the luminosity distance which accounts for the expansion of the universe. Therefore, if we are using the correct luminosity distance, then the formula holds. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, if the problem is assuming that we can approximate d_L ≈ (c z)/H₀, then the answer is D: 0.9.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a different approach. For example, if they consider that the flux is related to the intrinsic luminosity without considering cosmological expansion, but that would be incorrect. However, given that redshift is mentioned, it must be considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not considering cosmological distances at all, and just assuming that the redshift is negligible and using Hubble's law v = H₀ d, where v = z c. Then, d = v / H₀ = z c / H₀. Then, same result as before. Therefore, leading to the same calculation.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D: 0.9.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, the Eddington luminosity depends on the efficiency of the accretion. Wait, the Eddington limit is defined as the balance between radiation pressure and gravity. However, the actual luminosity of an accreting black hole depends on the accretion efficiency η, which is the fraction of the rest mass energy that is radiated away. However, the Eddington luminosity is independent of η. The Eddington luminosity is purely a balance of forces. The actual luminosity of the quasar would be η times the mass accretion rate times c². However, if the problem states that the accretion is Eddington limited, that might mean that the accretion rate is at the Eddington limit, i.e., the maximum rate before radiation pressure halts further accretion. Therefore, the luminosity would then be L = η Ṁ c², where Ṁ is the Eddington accretion rate. However, the Eddington accretion rate is Ṁ_Edd = L_Edd / (η c²). Therefore, substituting back, L = η * (L_Edd / (η c²)) * c² = L_Edd. Therefore, regardless of η, if the accretion is at the Eddington rate, then the luminosity is equal to the Eddington luminosity. Therefore, the luminosity is indeed L = L_Edd, independent of η. Therefore, my previous calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is indeed 0.9. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check the numbers again:\n\nz_A = 0.06, z_B = 0.02. So z_A/z_B = 3. Squared is 9.\n\nF_A = 1e-25, F_B = 1e-24. F_A / F_B = 0.1.\n\nMultiply 9 * 0.1 = 0.9. Yes.\n\nTherefore, answer D: 0.9.\n\nI think that's solid. Unless there is some other factor I haven't considered, like K-correction or something else. Wait, the bolometric flux is given. K-correction is usually for a specific band, but since it's bolometric, which is total luminosity, the K-correction is 1. Therefore, no correction needed. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D.\n</think>"}
