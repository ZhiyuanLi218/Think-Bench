The plasma is electrically neutral, has a very strong current, with radius R and current intensity I. The current density is uniform. Also, there's a beam of antiprotons moving relativistically at speed v parallel to the axis. But part (a) is just about the magnetic field distribution, so maybe the antiprotons are just context for the problem, but for part (a) maybe they aren't directly relevant? Let me focus on part (a) first.\n\nAlright, so the problem is about finding the magnetic field distribution inside a current-carrying plasma column with uniform current density. Since it's a discharge with a strong current, I can assume it's a steady current, so we can use Ampère's Law to find the magnetic field. \n\nFirst, let me recall Ampère's Law. In integral form, it states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field B around a closed loop is equal to μ₀ times the enclosed current I_enc. So, ∮ B · dl = μ₀ I_enc.\n\nGiven that the current density J is uniform, I can express J as I divided by the cross-sectional area. Since the current column has radius R, the total current I is J multiplied by πR². Therefore, J = I / (πR²).\n\nNow, to find the magnetic field distribution within the current column, I need to consider two regions: inside the column (r < R) and outside the column (r ≥ R). However, since the question specifies \"within the current column,\" I think part (a) is only asking about r ≤ R.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The problem says \"the distribution of the magnetic field within the current column,\" so that would be for r from 0 to R. \n\nSo, let's consider a circular Amperian loop of radius r, where r is less than or equal to R. The symmetry here is cylindrical, so the magnetic field should be tangential and have the same magnitude at every point on the loop. Therefore, the integral simplifies to B * 2πr = μ₀ I_enc.\n\nNow, I_enc is the current enclosed by the loop. Since the current density is uniform, the enclosed current I_enc is J multiplied by the area of the loop, which is πr². Therefore:\n\nI_enc = J * πr² = (I / πR²) * πr² = I * (r² / R²)\n\nPlugging this back into Ampère's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I * (r² / R²)\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ I r) / (2πR²) * (1/(2π))? Wait, no. Let me redo that step.\n\nWait:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ I_enc = μ₀ I (r²/R²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nB = [μ₀ I (r²/R²)] / (2πr) ) = μ₀ I r / (2π R²) ) ?\n\nWait, hold on:\n\nLet me write again:\n\nLeft side: ∮ B · dl = B * 2πr.\n\nRight side: μ₀ I_enc = μ₀ [I * (πr² / πR²)] = μ₀ I (r²/R²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ I (r²/R²)\n\nDivide both sides by 2πr:\n\nB = [μ₀ I (r²/R²)] / (2πr) ) = μ₀ I r / (2π R²) ) ?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the denominator is 2πr? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ I (r²/R²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nB = [μ₀ I (r²/R²)] / (2πr) ) = μ₀ I r / (2π R²) * ?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n[r² / R²] divided by 2πr is [r² / (2πr R²)] = r / (2π R²). Wait, but the units don't make sense? Wait, no, hold on. Let me check units.\n\nμ₀ has units of T·m/A. I is in A. r is in meters. R is in meters. So, μ₀ I r / (2π R²) would have units of T·m/A * A * m / m² = T·m² / m² = T. Okay, units check out. So that's okay.\n\nBut let me compare with the standard case of a long straight wire with uniform current density. For a long straight wire of radius R carrying current I with uniform J, the magnetic field inside (r ≤ R) is B = (μ₀ I r) / (2π R²) )? Wait, no, usually it's written as B = (μ₀ J r)/2, right?\n\nWait, let me recall. For an infinite straight wire with uniform current density J, the magnetic field at radius r inside the wire is given by Ampère's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ J * πr² => B = (μ₀ J r)/2. Since J = I / (πR²), substituting gives B = (μ₀ I r) / (2πR²) ) * π? Wait no:\n\nWait J = I / (πR²). Then substituting into B = (μ₀ J r)/2 gives:\n\nB = μ₀ (I / πR²) * r / 2 = μ₀ I r / (2π R²). Yes, that's correct. So that matches. Therefore, the expression we derived is correct. So inside the current column, the magnetic field increases linearly with r.\n\nTherefore, the distribution of the magnetic field within the current column is B(r) = (μ₀ I r) / (2π R²) ) for r ≤ R.\n\nBut let me check the standard formula again. For a straight wire with uniform current, yes, inside, B is proportional to r. Outside, it's proportional to 1/r. So this seems correct.\n\nBut wait, hold on, the problem mentions that it's a plasma discharge with a very strong current. Is there any other factor that I need to consider? For example, does the fact that it's a plasma and electrically neutral affect the magnetic field?\n\nWell, the plasma is electrically neutral, meaning that the positive and negative charges are balanced. However, since there's a current, that implies that there is a net movement of charges. In a typical current-carrying wire, it's the electrons that move, but the wire remains neutral. Similarly, in a plasma, which is a collection of ions and electrons, the current could be carried by both positive and negative charges moving in opposite directions. However, since the plasma is electrically neutral overall, the total charge density is zero. However, when there's a current, there's a net movement of charges, but the current density is still given by J = n q v_drift, where n is the number density, q is the charge, and v_drift is the drift velocity. But since the plasma is neutral, the positive and negative charges have equal and opposite currents? Or maybe not? Wait, in a neutral plasma, the number density of positive ions and electrons are equal, but if they are moving in opposite directions, then the total current would be the sum of the currents from both. However, since they have opposite charges, their contributions would add up. For example, if electrons are moving in one direction and ions in the opposite, the total current is I = I_electron + I_ion. However, since the problem states that the current density is uniform, and that the plasma is electrically neutral, but since we are given the total current I, perhaps we don't need to consider the individual contributions of ions and electrons. Because regardless of what's carrying the current, as long as we know the total current I and the current density is uniform, then Ampère's Law applies as usual. Because Ampère's Law depends on the total enclosed current, regardless of what's carrying it. So even if it's a plasma with both positive and negative charges contributing to the current, as long as the total current is I with uniform J, then the magnetic field would be the same as in the case of a wire with current I. Therefore, the previous calculation should hold.\n\nTherefore, the answer for part (a) is that the magnetic field inside the current column (r ≤ R) is B(r) = (μ₀ I r) / (2π R²) ), which can also be written as B(r) = (μ₀ J r)/2, since J = I/(πR²). \n\nBut let me write it in terms of I, as the problem gives I as the total current. So yes, B(r) = (μ₀ I r) / (2π R²). Alternatively, simplifying the expression:\n\nSince μ₀/(2π) is a factor... Wait, actually, let me check the standard formula again. For a straight wire with uniform current, the magnetic field inside is B = (μ₀ I r)/(2π R²) * π? No, earlier we saw that B = μ₀ I r / (2π R²). Wait, but let me think again:\n\nOriginal Ampère's Law:\n\nInside the wire (radius R, total current I, uniform J):\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enc = μ₀ * (I / πR²) * πr²) = μ₀ I (r²/R²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nB = μ₀ I r / (2π R²) * ?\n\nWait, solving for B:\n\nB = [μ₀ I (r²/R²)] / (2πr) ) = μ₀ I r / (2π R²). Yes. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since μ₀ I / (2π R²) is a constant, multiplied by r. Therefore, the magnetic field increases linearly from 0 at the center to a maximum at r = R of B(R) = μ₀ I / (2π R). Wait, let me compute B(R):\n\nB(R) = μ₀ I R / (2π R²) ) = μ₀ I / (2π R). But in the standard case of a straight wire, outside the wire, the magnetic field is B = μ₀ I / (2π r). So at r = R, outside, it would be μ₀ I / (2π R). Therefore, the magnetic field is continuous at r = R. Inside, it's proportional to r, outside proportional to 1/r. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the distribution is linear with r inside the column. Therefore, the answer for part (a) is B(r) = (μ₀ I r)/(2π R²) for 0 ≤ r ≤ R. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other aspect. The problem mentions that the plasma is electrically neutral. Does that affect anything? For example, in a neutral plasma, there are equal amounts of positive and negative charges. However, when there's a current, those charges are moving. But since we are dealing with magnetostatics (assuming steady current), the magnetic field depends only on the current, not on the static charges. Since the plasma is neutral, there is no net charge, so there's no electric field to consider in magnetostatics. Therefore, the magnetic field calculation remains as above. Therefore, the answer is as derived.\n\nBut let me think again: if there's a current, there's moving charges. However, since the plasma is neutral, the charge density is zero. So even though there are moving charges, the net charge is zero. Therefore, there is no contribution to the electric field, and hence no displacement current (which is relevant in Maxwell's equations when considering time-varying electric fields). However, since the problem mentions a discharge with very strong current, but if it's a steady current, then displacement current is zero. Therefore, Ampère's Law without displacement current is sufficient. Therefore, our calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B(r) = (μ₀ I r) / (2π R²) for r ≤ R.\n\nAlternatively, simplifying constants:\n\nμ₀/(2π) is a factor. Let me write it as:\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ I / (2π R²)) * r. \n\nYes, so that's the expression.\n\nTherefore, boxed, it would be:\n\nB(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I r}{2\\pi R^2}\n\nBut let me check standard expressions. For example, in the case of a long straight wire with uniform current, the internal magnetic field is B = (μ₀ I r)/(2π R²). Wait, but another way to write it is B = (μ₀ J r)/2. Since J = I/(πR²), so substituting gives the same thing. Therefore, both forms are equivalent. The problem gives I and R as parameters, so expressing it in terms of I is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the answer for part (a). The antiprotons mentioned in the problem might be relevant for part (b) or beyond, but since part (a) is only about the magnetic field distribution, they don't affect this part. \n\nJust to recap: using Ampère's Law with uniform current density, calculating enclosed current as proportional to r², solving for B gives linear in r. All steps check out. Units are correct. Continuity at r=R matches with external field. Therefore, confident this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe magnetic field distribution within the current column is \\boxed{B(r) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 I r}{2\\pi R^2}}.\n</think>"}
