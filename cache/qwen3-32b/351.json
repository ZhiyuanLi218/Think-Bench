Let me recall what I know about rocket engines and thrust. \n\nThrust in a rocket engine is produced by expelling mass (exhaust gases) at high velocity. The basic principle here is Newton's third law—action and reaction. But more quantitatively, I remember that thrust (F) can be related to the exhaust velocity (v) and the mass flow rate (dm/dt) of the expelled gas. \n\nThe formula that comes to mind is F = v * (dm/dt). Is that right? Let me think. Yes, thrust is equal to the exhaust velocity multiplied by the mass flow rate. So if I rearrange that formula, the mass flow rate would be F divided by v. \n\nGiven in the problem, the thrust F is 4.8 × 10^6 Newtons, and the exhaust velocity v is 3 km/s. Wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Velocity is given in km/s, so I should convert that to meters per second for SI units. 3 km/s is 3000 m/s. \n\nSo substituting the values into the formula: dm/dt = F / v = (4.8 × 10^6 N) / (3000 m/s). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 4.8 × 10^6 divided by 3 × 10^3. Dividing the coefficients: 4.8 / 3 = 1.6. Then the exponents: 10^6 / 10^3 = 10^3. So multiplying those together gives 1.6 × 10^3 kg/s. \n\nSo the mass ejected per second is 1.6 × 10^3 kg, which corresponds to option B. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The formula is correct? Let me verify. Thrust equation for rockets is indeed F = dm/dt * v. Assuming that the exhaust velocity is constant and there's no other significant factors like pressure terms (which might be negligible in some cases or included in the given thrust value). Since the problem gives straightforward numbers, I think this simplified formula applies here. \n\nYes, so 4.8e6 divided by 3e3 equals 1.6e3. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculation. The key was converting km/s to m/s and then straightforward division. The answer should be B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
