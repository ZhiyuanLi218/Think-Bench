The phase velocity of light in a medium with refractive index $ n $ is:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{phase}} = \\frac{c}{n}\n$$\n\nLet the velocity of the particle be $ v = \\beta c $, where $ \\beta = v/c $. The condition for Cherenkov radiation is:\n\n$$\nv > \\frac{c}{n} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\beta > \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Geometric Derivation of the Cherenkov Angle**\n\nWhen a charged particle travels faster than the speed of light in a medium, it emits electromagnetic waves that propagate spherically at speed $ c/n $. Due to the particle's motion, these wavefronts constructively interfere in a cone-like pattern, forming a **Cherenkov cone**.\n\nLet’s consider the geometry of this process. Suppose the particle moves from point $ A $ to point $ B $ in time $ \\Delta t $, a distance of $ v \\Delta t $. During this same time, a wavefront emitted at point $ A $ expands to a radius of $ \\frac{c}{n} \\Delta t $. The Cherenkov radiation forms at an angle $ \\theta $ with respect to the direction of motion of the particle.\n\nIn this configuration, the angle $ \\theta $ is determined by the ratio of the speed of light in the medium to the speed of the particle. Specifically, the sine of the Cherenkov angle is given by:\n\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\text{speed of light in the medium}}{\\text{speed of the particle}} = \\frac{c/n}{v} = \\frac{1}{n \\beta}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Relationship**\n\nThus, the relationship between the particle’s velocity $ v = \\beta c $, the refractive index $ n $, and the Cherenkov angle $ \\theta $ is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{n\\beta}}\n$$\n\nThis equation governs the angle at which Cherenkov radiation is emitted in a given medium for a particle moving with velocity $ v $.

Let me start by recalling what I know about Cherenkov radiation. From what I remember, when a charged particle moves through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium, it emits Cherenkov radiation. The angle of the radiation depends on the particle's speed and the medium's refractive index. But how exactly?\n\nFirst, let me think about the speed of light in a medium. The speed of light in a vacuum is c, but in a medium, it's slower. The refractive index n is defined as n = c / v_phase, where v_phase is the phase velocity of light in the medium. So, the phase velocity is c/n. \n\nNow, the particle is moving with velocity v. For Cherenkov radiation to occur, the particle's speed must exceed the phase velocity of light in the medium. So the condition is v > c/n. Let me write that down:\n\nv > c/n\n\nBut the problem is to find the relationship between v (which is βc, where β is v/c), n, and the angle θ. \n\nI think the angle θ is related to the direction of the emitted radiation. I remember there's a formula involving the inverse of the refractive index and the beta. Maybe something like cosθ = 1/(nβ)? Wait, not sure. Let me try to derive it.\n\nLet me visualize the situation. Imagine a charged particle moving through a medium. As it moves, it polarizes the medium, creating electromagnetic waves. However, because the particle is moving faster than the phase velocity of light in the medium, these waves interfere constructively in a specific direction, leading to the emission of Cherenkov radiation at a particular angle θ relative to the particle's path.\n\nTo derive θ, I need to consider the geometry of the wavefronts. Let me consider two points along the particle's path. Suppose the particle moves from point A to point B in a time Δt. The distance between A and B is vΔt. \n\nAt point A, the particle emits a wave that propagates outward with speed c/n. Similarly, at point B, the particle emits another wave that propagates with the same speed. For constructive interference (and hence radiation), the wavefronts need to be in phase. The condition for this constructive interference should depend on the angle θ.\n\nLet me draw a diagram in my mind. The wavefront from A has traveled a distance (c/n)Δt. The wavefront from B, emitted at a later time, has traveled a shorter distance because the particle is moving. Wait, no. Both wavefronts are emitted at different times. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when the particle is at A, it emits a spherical wavefront which expands with velocity c/n. After time Δt, the particle has moved to point B, which is a distance vΔt away from A. At this moment, the wavefront emitted at A has expanded to a radius of (c/n)Δt. The wavefront emitted at B (at time Δt) will start expanding from B. \n\nFor the waves to interfere constructively, the secondary wavefront from B must catch up with the primary wavefront from A in such a way that their phases align. The condition for this is that the path difference between the waves leads to constructive interference. \n\nAlternatively, considering the wavefronts, the angle θ is determined by the condition that the distance traveled by the particle during time Δt (vΔt) is related to the distance traveled by the light wave (c/n Δt) and the angle θ. \n\nLet me consider the geometry. If I look at the wavefronts emitted at different points along the particle's path, the Cherenkov radiation forms a cone with angle θ. The apex of the cone is at the particle's current position. The wavefronts are spherical, but because the particle is moving, the centers of the spheres are moving. The envelope of these spheres forms a cone.\n\nTo find the angle of the cone, I can consider the triangle formed by the particle's path and the wavefront. Let me consider two points: the current position of the particle, and a previous position. The wavefront emitted at the previous position has expanded to a radius of (c/n)Δt. The distance between the two positions is vΔt. The angle θ is such that the wavefront touches the cone. \n\nIn this triangle, the radius of the wavefront is (c/n)Δt, and the distance between the two points is vΔt. The angle θ is between the direction of motion and the wavefront. So, if I imagine a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the distance between the two points (vΔt), and the adjacent side is the radius of the wavefront times something... Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the wavefront.\n\nAt time t, the particle has moved a distance l = vt. The wavefront emitted at time t=0 has radius r = (c/n)t. The wavefront emitted at time t must satisfy some condition. The Cherenkov condition is that the wavefronts emitted at different times form a cone. The angle θ is determined by the ratio between the distance the particle travels and the distance the light travels.\n\nSo, if I consider the time Δt, the particle moves vΔt, and the light moves (c/n)Δt. The angle θ is such that the wavefront from A (previous position) reaches the same point as the wavefront from B (current position) after some time. Wait, maybe I need to use the concept of phase matching.\n\nLet me think about the phase. For the waves to be in phase along the direction of the cone, the number of oscillations in the path of the particle and the light must match. Suppose the particle moves from A to B in time Δt. The wave emitted at A propagates to a point P, which is at an angle θ from the direction of motion. The wave emitted at B also propagates to P. The time it takes for the wave from A to reach P is Δt, and the time for the wave from B to reach P is less? Or maybe there's a phase difference.\n\nAlternatively, consider the optical path length. The phase difference between successive wavefronts should be an integer multiple of 2π for constructive interference. Let me denote the distance from A to P as r_A, and from B to P as r_B. The optical path length difference would be n(r_A - r_B). For constructive interference, this difference should be equal to mλ, where m is an integer and λ is the wavelength in vacuum? Or in medium?\n\nWait, the wavelength in the medium is λ/n, since the frequency remains the same, but the speed is c/n. So the wavelength λ_medium = c/(n f). Whereas in vacuum, it's λ = c/f. So λ_medium = λ / n.\n\nBut maybe I need to think about the phase velocity. The phase difference between two wavefronts is determined by the difference in their optical paths. For the waves to be in phase, the optical path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the medium.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me consider the geometry. The wavefront emitted at A has to reach P, which is a point on the Cherenkov cone. The distance from A to P is the radius of the wavefront, which is (c/n)Δt. The distance from B to P can be found using the law of cosines. The triangle ABP has sides vΔt, (c/n)Δt, and the angle between them is θ. Wait, no. If θ is the angle between the particle's direction and the radiation, then the angle between AB and AP would be θ?\n\nLet me sketch mentally: particle moves from A to B, direction AB. The point P lies on the Cherenkov cone, so the line AP makes angle θ with AB. The length AB is vΔt. The length AP is (c/n)Δt. Then, the distance BP is the same as the length of the wavefront emitted at B, which would have had time Δt' to propagate. Wait, but maybe we need to consider that at the moment the particle is at B, the wavefront from A has just reached P. So the time taken for the wavefront to go from A to P is Δt, same as the time the particle takes to go from A to B. Therefore, in that time, the wavefront from A has traveled AP = (c/n)Δt, and the distance AB is vΔt. \n\nNow, looking at triangle ABP, we have AB = vΔt, AP = (c/n)Δt, and angle at A is θ. Wait, if AP is the wavefront, then the angle between AP and AB is θ. So in triangle ABP, we can apply the sine or cosine law.\n\nWait, if angle at P is 90 degrees? No, not necessarily. Let me think again. If I imagine the cone, the Cherenkov radiation is emitted in a cone with half-angle θ. So, if I take a cross-section through the axis of the cone, the triangle would be formed by the particle's path AB, and two generators of the cone AP and AQ (symmetrical on either side). The angle between AB and AP is θ. \n\nIn triangle ABP, AB = vΔt, AP = (c/n)Δt, and the angle at P is... Hmm. Maybe using the cosine law here. Let me denote AB = vΔt, AP = (c/n)Δt, and BP is the distance from B to P. But if P is on the wavefront emitted at A, then BP would be the distance from B to P, which the wave emitted at B would have to travel to reach P. However, since the wavefront from A reaches P at time Δt, the wavefront from B would have had less time to reach P. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the Cherenkov radiation is emitted in a direction such that the time it takes for the light to reach a certain point is synchronized with the particle's motion. Let me consider the wavefronts emitted at different times. The condition for the formation of the shockwave (Cherenkov radiation) is similar to the formation of a sonic boom, where the waves interfere constructively.\n\nIn the case of a sonic boom, the Mach angle μ is given by sin μ = c_sound / v, where c_sound is the speed of sound and v is the speed of the object. Similarly, for Cherenkov radiation, there should be an analogous angle. \n\nIn that case, if I recall, the Cherenkov angle θ satisfies cos θ = 1/(nβ), but I need to derive it.\n\nLet me try to use the analogy with the Mach cone. In the Mach cone, the angle is determined by the ratio of the speed of sound to the speed of the object. For Cherenkov, it's the ratio of the speed of light in the medium to the speed of the particle.\n\nSo, if the speed of the particle v is greater than c/n, then the angle θ satisfies sin θ = (c/n)/v = 1/(nβ), since β = v/c. Therefore, sin θ = 1/(nβ). Therefore, θ = arcsin(1/(nβ)). \n\nWait, but I need to check this derivation. Let me think again. In the sonic boom analogy, the Mach angle μ is given by sin μ = c / v, where c is the speed of sound and v is the speed of the object. For Cherenkov, the speed of the \"wave\" is c/n, and the speed of the particle is v. Therefore, the angle θ should satisfy sin θ = (c/n)/v = 1/(nβ). So yes, θ = arcsin(1/(nβ)). \n\nBut let me try to derive it from the geometry. Let me consider the time it takes for the particle to move from A to B, which is Δt. The distance AB is vΔt. The wavefront emitted at A propagates to a point P, which is located at a distance of (c/n)Δt from A. The direction of P makes an angle θ with AB. \n\nIn triangle ABP, AB = vΔt, AP = (c/n)Δt, and angle at A is θ. If I apply the sine law here, maybe?\n\nWait, the triangle ABP: points A, B, P. AB is the path of the particle. AP is the wavefront from A to P. BP is... Well, if P is on the Cherenkov cone, then BP would be another wavefront? Not sure. Alternatively, if we consider that the wavefront from A reaches P at time Δt, and the wavefront from B would reach P at some other time. But for the constructive interference, the wavefronts must be in phase. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the optical path length from A to P must be equal to the optical path length from B to P plus some multiple of the wavelength? Maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, let me imagine that the wavefronts emitted at different times form a cone. The angle of the cone can be found by considering the relation between the distance the particle travels and the distance the light travels. \n\nAt any moment, the particle is at a new position, and emits a new wavefront. The envelope of all these wavefronts is the Cherenkov cone. To find the angle of the cone, consider that for each wavefront emitted at time t, it has radius r = (c/n)t. The particle is at position x = vt along the axis. The envelope condition is that the wavefront is tangent to the cone. \n\nThe equation for the wavefront emitted at time t is a sphere: (X - vt)^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = (c t / n)^2. Assuming motion along the X-axis. The Cherenkov cone is the envelope of all these spheres. To find the envelope, we can use calculus. \n\nThe envelope satisfies the equation of the sphere and the derivative with respect to t equals zero. Let me consider 2D for simplicity, so Y^2 + (X - vt)^2 = (c t / n)^2.\n\nLet me denote X as the axis of motion. The envelope condition is when the derivative of the left-hand side minus the right-hand side with respect to t is zero. \n\nSo, take the equation:\n\nY² + (X - vt)² - (c² t²)/n² = 0.\n\nTake derivative with respect to t:\n\n2(X - vt)(-v) - 2(c² t)/n² = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2v(X - vt) - 2(c² t)/n² = 0.\n\nDivide by -2:\n\nv(X - vt) + (c² t)/n² = 0.\n\nExpand:\n\nvX - v² t + (c² t)/n² = 0.\n\nSolve for X:\n\nvX = t(v² - c² /n² )\n\nX = t(v - (c²)/(v n² )) \n\nBut we need to relate this to Y. Also, from the original equation:\n\nY² + (X - vt)^2 = (c t /n )² \n\nLet me substitute X from the envelope condition into this equation. \n\nFirst, compute X - vt:\n\nX - vt = t(v - c²/(v n² )) - vt = - t c²/(v n² )\n\nTherefore:\n\nY² + [ - t c²/(v n² ) ]² = (c t /n )² \n\nSimplify:\n\nY² + t² c^4 / (v² n^4 ) = t² c² / n² \n\nRearrange:\n\nY² = t² c² / n² - t² c^4 / (v² n^4 )\n\nFactor t² c² / n²:\n\nY² = t² c² / n² [ 1 - c²/(v² n² ) ]\n\nBut from the expression for X, X = t(v - c²/(v n² )) \n\nLet me solve for t from X:\n\nt = X / [v - c²/(v n² ) ] = X v / [v² - c² /n² ]\n\nNow, substitute t into Y²:\n\nY² = [X² v² / (v² - c² /n² )² ] * c² / n² [ 1 - c²/(v² n² ) ]\n\nSimplify the term in the brackets:\n\n[ 1 - c²/(v² n² ) ] = [ (v² n² - c² ) / (v² n² ) ]\n\nTherefore:\n\nY² = [X² v² / (v² - c² /n² )² ] * c² / n² * (v² n² - c² ) / (v² n² )\n\nSimplify denominator terms:\n\nNote that v² - c² /n² = (v² n² - c² ) / n² \n\nTherefore, (v² - c² /n² )² = (v² n² - c² )² / n^4 \n\nSubstituting back:\n\nY² = [X² v² / ( (v² n² - c² )² / n^4 ) ] * c² / n² * (v² n² - c² ) / (v² n² )\n\nSimplify step by step:\n\nFirst term: X² v² * n^4 / (v² n² - c² )² \n\nMultiply by c² / n²: X² v² * n^4 / (v² n² - c² )² * c² / n² = X² v² c² n² / (v² n² - c² )² \n\nMultiply by (v² n² - c² ) / (v² n² ): \n\nY² = X² v² c² n² / (v² n² - c² )² * (v² n² - c² ) / (v² n² )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe (v² n² - c² ) terms: one cancels, leaving denominator as (v² n² - c² )\n\nAnd n² / v² n² = 1 / v² \n\nWait:\n\nLet me write:\n\nY² = X² v² c² n² / [ (v² n² - c² )² ] * [ (v² n² - c² ) / (v² n² ) ]\n\nWhich is:\n\nY² = X² v² c² n² / [ (v² n² - c² ) (v² n² ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nCancel v² n² in numerator and denominator:\n\nY² = X² c² / (v² n² - c² )\n\nTherefore:\n\nY² = X² c² / [ v² n² - c² ]\n\nThis is the equation of a cone. Let me write it as:\n\n(Y / X )² = c² / [ v² n² - c² ]\n\nTherefore:\n\n(Y / X ) = c / sqrt( v² n² - c² )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\ntan θ = c / sqrt( v² n² - c² )\n\nWhere θ is the angle between the X-axis (particle direction) and the cone surface (Y/X = tan θ).\n\nLet me manipulate this expression:\n\ntan θ = c / sqrt( v² n² - c² ) \n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by c:\n\ntan θ = 1 / sqrt( (v² n² / c² ) - 1 )\n\nBut v = β c, so v² / c² = β²:\n\ntan θ = 1 / sqrt( β² n² - 1 )\n\nAlternatively, we can express this in terms of sin θ. Let me consider a right triangle where the opposite side is 1, and the adjacent side is sqrt( β² n² - 1 ). Then the hypotenuse is sqrt(1 + β² n² - 1 ) = sqrt( β² n² ) = β n. \n\nTherefore, sin θ = opposite / hypotenuse = 1 / (β n )\n\nSo, sin θ = 1/(β n )\n\nTherefore, θ = arcsin( 1/(β n ) )\n\nWhich is the relation we were supposed to find. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the Cherenkov angle θ satisfies:\n\nsin θ = 1/(n β )\n\nSince β = v/c, we can also write:\n\nsin θ = c/(n v )\n\nOr, rearranged:\n\nv = c/(n sin θ )\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the particle's velocity v, the refractive index n, and the Cherenkov angle θ is given by sin θ = 1/(n β ), where β = v/c.\n\nLet me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the envelope condition, derived the equation of the cone, ended up with tan θ = c / sqrt(v² n² - c² ), then converted to sin θ = 1/(n β ). Seems correct. Also, the analogy with the Mach cone gives sin θ = (speed of wave)/(speed of particle) = (c/n)/v = 1/(n β ), which matches. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is sin θ = 1/(n β ). So the angle depends inversely on β and n. For a given medium (fixed n), faster particles (higher β) have smaller angles. For a given particle speed, higher refractive index also leads to smaller angles. Which makes sense because if the medium slows down light more (higher n), the particle needs to be moving faster relative to c/n to create Cherenkov radiation, and the angle becomes narrower.\n\nLet me also check the condition for Cherenkov radiation to occur. The argument of the arcsin must be less than or equal to 1. So 1/(n β ) ≤ 1 ⇒ β ≥ 1/n, which is the condition that v ≥ c/n. Which matches the initial condition for Cherenkov radiation. If β < 1/n, then sin θ would be greater than 1, which is impossible, meaning no real solution for θ, hence no Cherenkov radiation. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the derived relationship is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe relationship between the particle's velocity, the refractive index, and the Cherenkov angle is given by \\boxed{\\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{n\\beta}}.\n</think>"}
