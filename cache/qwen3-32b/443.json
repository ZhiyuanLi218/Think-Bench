The problem says that the potential energy U(r) is V(r) plus some term involving the Laplacian of V(r), multiplied by r₀² over 6. Since r₀ is very small, this term is a perturbation. So, the Lamb shift is essentially the energy shift due to this perturbation. \n\nFirst, I should recall how perturbation theory works. In non-degenerate perturbation theory, the first-order energy shift is given by the expectation value of the perturbing Hamiltonian. Here, the perturbation is the term (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r). Therefore, the Lamb shift ΔE should be ⟨ψ_{2p}| (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) |ψ_{2p}⟩.\n\nGiven that the unperturbed potential is V(r) = -e² / r. So I need to compute ∇²V(r) first. Let me recall how to compute the Laplacian of 1/r. Wait, but here V(r) is -e²/r. So ∇²V(r) would be -e² ∇²(1/r). \n\nFrom electrostatics, I remember that ∇²(1/r) = -4π δ³(r). Is that right? Let me check. The Laplacian of 1/r is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it has a singularity. And integrating ∇²(1/r) over all space gives -4π, so ∇²(1/r) = -4π δ³(r). Therefore, ∇²V(r) = -e² * (-4π δ³(r)) = 4π e² δ³(r). \n\nWait, let me verify again. Let me take V(r) = -e² / r. Then ∇²V(r) = -e² ∇²(1/r). And ∇²(1/r) is -4π δ³(r). Therefore, ∇²V(r) = -e² (-4π δ³(r)) = 4π e² δ³(r). Yes, that seems right. \n\nTherefore, the perturbation term is (r₀² / 6) * 4π e² δ³(r) = (2π e² r₀² / 3) δ³(r). \n\nTherefore, the Lamb shift ΔE is ⟨ψ_{2p}| (2π e² r₀² / 3) δ³(r) |ψ_{2p}⟩. Since the delta function δ³(r) is non-zero only at r=0, the expectation value reduces to the square of the wave function at r=0 multiplied by (2π e² r₀² / 3). \n\nBut wait, the 2p wave function. Let me look at the given wave function for ψ_{2p}(r). The given wave function is ψ_{2p}(r) = 2 a₀^{-5/2} r e^{-r/(2a₀)} Y₁^m / sqrt(24). \n\nSo ψ_{2p} depends on r as r e^{-r/(2a₀)}, and multiplied by the spherical harmonics Y₁^m. Now, when I take |ψ_{2p}(r)|² and multiply by δ³(r), the integral over all space will be |ψ(0)|², because δ³(r) picks out the value at r=0. \n\nBut wait, let's check: ψ_{2p}(r) has a factor of r. So when r approaches 0, ψ(r) approaches 0. Therefore, ψ(0) is zero? That would mean that the expectation value is zero? But that would imply the Lamb shift is zero for the 2p level? But I thought the Lamb shift is a small difference between 2s and 2p levels. Wait, but here we are considering the 2p level. \n\nBut if the wave function at r=0 is zero for 2p, then the expectation value of δ³(r) would be zero. Therefore, the first-order perturbation would be zero. However, the Lamb shift is a real effect, so perhaps there is a mistake here? Or maybe I need to consider higher-order terms? Wait, but the question says that the r₀² term is a small perturbation. So maybe in reality, the perturbation isn't just proportional to δ³(r), but there is more to it? Or perhaps my calculation is missing something?\n\nWait, let me check again. The given potential energy is U(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ... So the perturbation is (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r). But I calculated ∇²V(r) as 4π e² δ³(r). Therefore, the perturbation is proportional to δ³(r). However, if the wave function is zero at r=0, then the expectation value is zero. \n\nBut in reality, the Lamb shift is due to vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, which is a quantum electrodynamics effect. However, the problem is modeling it here as a perturbation due to the finite size of the electron, represented by the r₀ term. But if the wave function for 2p is zero at the origin, then the expectation value is zero. But the Lamb shift is known to be non-zero for s states (like 2s) because their wave functions are non-zero at the origin. For p states, since their wave functions are zero at the origin, the Lamb shift is zero? \n\nWait, but the problem is specifically asking for the Lamb shift for the 2p energy level. Maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps my calculation is missing something. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, the wave function given for ψ_{2p} is proportional to r e^{-r/(2a₀)}. So indeed, at r=0, ψ is zero. Therefore, |ψ(0)|² is zero. Therefore, ⟨δ³(r)⟩ = |ψ(0)|² = 0. Therefore, the first-order energy shift is zero. \n\nBut the problem says that the Lamb shift can be considered as a minute correction due to this property of real electrons. However, if the correction is zero for 2p, then why is the problem asking for it? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait, perhaps the expansion of U(r) is not just V(r) + (r₀² / 6)∇²V(r)... Maybe there are more terms? Or perhaps the perturbation is not just the Laplacian term? \n\nAlternatively, maybe my calculation of ∇²V(r) is incorrect? Let me check again. Let me recall that ∇²(1/r) = -4π δ³(r). Therefore, ∇²(-e² / r) = -e² ∇²(1/r) = -e² (-4π δ³(r)) = 4π e² δ³(r). So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perturbation is not just the Laplacian term, but there are other terms in the expansion? The problem says the potential energy is U(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 6)∇²V(r) + ... So maybe there are higher-order terms? But the problem says that the r₀² term can be regarded as a small perturbation. So if the first-order term is zero, maybe the Lamb shift for 2p is zero? But that seems odd. \n\nWait, but in reality, the Lamb shift arises from the interaction of the electron with the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, which leads to a correction that is not just a delta function. However, in this problem, it's modeled as a finite size effect of the electron, leading to a correction proportional to the Laplacian of the potential. But if the wave function is zero at the origin, then this term would vanish. However, in reality, the Lamb shift for p states is not zero, but smaller than for s states. Wait, no, actually, the Lamb shift is a small difference between 2s and 2p levels. For the 2p level, maybe the shift is zero? \n\nBut according to the problem's setup, we are to calculate the Lamb shift for 2p level due to this perturbation. If according to our calculation, it's zero, then perhaps that's the answer? But the problem says \"Determine the Lamb shift for the 2p energy level of the hydrogen atom\", so maybe there is a non-zero shift? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the perturbation is only the Laplacian term? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the expansion. Let me think again. The potential energy of a small charged sphere in an external potential. Normally, the potential energy of a charge distribution ρ in an external potential V is ∫ ρ V d³r. If the charge distribution is a sphere of radius r₀, uniformly charged, then maybe we can expand V(r) around the center of the sphere. \n\nLet me recall that for a small charge distribution, the potential energy can be expanded in terms of multipole moments. However, if the external potential is V(r), then the expansion would involve the value of V at the center, plus terms involving derivatives of V. For a sphere of radius r₀, the potential energy would be approximately the charge times V at the center, plus corrections. \n\nBut if the charge is uniformly distributed over a sphere of radius r₀, then the potential energy might involve the average of V over the sphere. Using Taylor expansion, V(r) ≈ V(r₀) + (1/6) r₀² ∇²V(r) + ... So maybe the average of V over the sphere would give this term. Therefore, the potential energy is U = q [V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ...]. \n\nTherefore, if the charge is q, then the perturbation is (q r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r). For the hydrogen atom, the potential V(r) is -e² / r, so ∇²V(r) is 4π e² δ³(r) as before. Therefore, the perturbation is (q r₀² / 6) * 4π e² δ³(r). \n\nBut here, q is the charge of the sphere. Since it's a hydrogen atom, the electron has charge -e. Therefore, q = -e. Therefore, the perturbation becomes (-e) * r₀² / 6 * 4π e² δ³(r) = - (4π e³ r₀² / 6) δ³(r) = - (2π e³ r₀² / 3) δ³(r). \n\nWait, previously I had considered the perturbation as (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r), but if V(r) is the external potential, and the charge is q, then the potential energy is q times the average of V over the charge distribution. So if the charge is -e, then yes, the perturbation would be -e times the expansion term. Therefore, my previous calculation missed the negative sign from the charge. \n\nBut in any case, the expectation value would be proportional to |ψ(0)|², which is zero for 2p. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lamb shift for the 2p level is zero? But then why is the problem asking for it? Maybe there is a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is different? Let me think again. The expansion of the potential energy for a small sphere. Let me recall that for a sphere of radius r₀, the average value of V over the sphere is V(r) + (1/6) r₀² ∇²V(r) + ... So if the potential energy is the charge times the average potential, then yes, the term is as given. \n\nBut if the wave function is zero at r=0, then the expectation value is zero. Therefore, the Lamb shift for the 2p level is zero. However, in reality, the Lamb shift is due to vacuum polarization and self-energy, which might involve different terms. But according to the problem's setup, where the Lamb shift is modeled as this perturbation, maybe the answer is zero. \n\nBut the problem says \"Determine the Lamb shift for the 2p energy level...\", so maybe the answer is zero? But I need to check again. \n\nWait, let me check the given wave function again. The wave function is ψ_{2p}(r) = 2 a₀^{-5/2} r e^{-r/(2a₀)} Y₁^m / sqrt(24). So ψ(r) is proportional to r, so at r=0, ψ(r)=0. Therefore, |ψ(0)|²=0. Therefore, ⟨δ³(r)⟩ = |ψ(0)|² = 0. Therefore, ΔE = 0? \n\nBut then why is the problem asking for it? Unless there is an error in my calculation. \n\nWait, perhaps the expansion is not only for the average potential but includes other terms? For example, maybe higher-order terms in the expansion? The given U(r) is written as V(r) + (r₀² / 6)∇²V(r) + ... So maybe there are more terms. However, the problem says that the r₀² term is a small perturbation. If the first-order term is zero, perhaps the next term is non-zero? But the problem does not give more terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign or coefficient? Let me check again. \n\nThe average of V over a sphere of radius r₀ centered at r is:\n\nV_avg ≈ V(r) + (1/6) ⟨r²⟩ ∇²V(r) + ... \n\nFor a sphere, ⟨r²⟩ is the average of r² over the sphere. For a uniform sphere, ⟨r²⟩ = (3/5) r₀². Therefore, the average would be V(r) + (1/6)(3/5 r₀²) ∇²V(r) + ... = V(r) + (r₀² / 10) ∇²V(r) + ... \n\nBut the problem states that the potential energy is V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ... So maybe there is a difference in the coefficient depending on the charge distribution? \n\nAlternatively, if the charge is a point charge, but smeared out over a sphere. For example, if the electron is modeled as a sphere of radius r₀ with uniform charge density, then the potential energy would involve the average of the external potential over the sphere. \n\nBut for a sphere of radius r₀, the average of V(r + r') over r' (with |r'| ≤ r₀) can be expanded in a Taylor series:\n\nV(r + r') ≈ V(r) + (1/6) r'² ∇²V(r) + ... \n\nTherefore, the average over the sphere would be V(r) + (1/6) ⟨r'²⟩ ∇²V(r) + ... \n\nIf the sphere has radius r₀, then ⟨r'²⟩ depends on the distribution. For a uniform distribution, ⟨r'²⟩ = (3/5) r₀². Therefore, the average would be V(r) + (1/6)(3/5 r₀²) ∇²V(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 10) ∇²V(r). \n\nBut the problem says the potential energy is V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ... So perhaps the problem is assuming a different distribution? For example, if the charge is distributed as a Gaussian or something else? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different convention where ⟨r'²⟩ = r₀². Then the coefficient would be 1/6. But in reality, for a uniform sphere, it's 3/5 r₀². However, maybe for simplicity, the problem is using ⟨r'²⟩ = r₀², hence the coefficient 1/6. \n\nIn any case, according to the problem statement, the potential energy is given as U(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ... So regardless of the exact coefficient, we have to go with what's given. Therefore, proceeding with the given coefficient, the perturbation is (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) = (r₀² / 6)(4π e² δ³(r)) as before. \n\nTherefore, the perturbation Hamiltonian is H' = (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) = (2π e² r₀² / 3) δ³(r). \n\nTherefore, the first-order energy shift is ⟨ψ_{2p}| H' |ψ_{2p}⟩ = (2π e² r₀² / 3) |ψ(0)|². \n\nBut ψ_{2p}(0) = 0, so the shift is zero. \n\nBut then why is the problem asking for it? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the Lamb shift in reality is not modeled by this perturbation for the 2p level? Or perhaps there is a different approach? \n\nWait, maybe the expansion is not just about the average potential, but also includes other terms? For example, if the charge distribution is not spherically symmetric? But the problem says the sphere is uniformly charged, so it's spherically symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a different kind of perturbation? For example, in reality, the Lamb shift comes from the electron's interaction with the vacuum fluctuations, which leads to a correction to the Coulomb potential. This correction is usually calculated in QED, but here it's modeled as a finite size effect. \n\nBut if the finite size effect leads to a perturbation proportional to δ³(r), then for states with ψ(0) ≠ 0, like the 2s state, there is a shift, but for 2p, it's zero. Therefore, the Lamb shift for 2p is zero in this model. \n\nBut the problem says \"the Lamb shift can be considered as a minute correction to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom due to this property of real electrons.\" If real electrons have a finite size, then in this model, only states with non-zero wave function at the origin would have a shift. Therefore, the 2p level has zero shift. \n\nTherefore, the answer is zero? But the problem is asking to determine it and express in terms of r₀ and fundamental constants. If it's zero, then it's just zero. But maybe I made a mistake in calculating ψ(0). Let me check the given wave function again. \n\nThe wave function is ψ_{2p}(r) = 2 a₀^{-5/2} r e^{-r/(2a₀)} Y₁^m / sqrt(24). \n\nYes, it's proportional to r, so at r=0, ψ(r) is zero. Therefore, the expectation value of δ³(r) is zero. Therefore, the first-order energy shift is zero. \n\nBut then why is the problem asking about the 2p level? Maybe there's a typo and it should be the 2s level? Or maybe the problem is expecting me to consider higher-order terms in the expansion? \n\nThe given expansion for U(r) is written as V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ... So there are higher-order terms. If the first-order term is zero, maybe the second-order term is non-zero? But the problem says that the r₀² term is a small perturbation, so perhaps we are only to consider the first-order term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a misunderstanding in the definition of the perturbation. Let me check again. The potential energy of a small charged sphere in an external potential. Let me think of it as follows: \n\nThe potential energy of a charge distribution ρ(r') in an external potential V(r) is ∫ ρ(r') V(r + r') d³r'. If the charge distribution is localized around r'=0, then we can expand V(r + r') around r:\n\nV(r + r') ≈ V(r) + r' · ∇V(r) + (1/2) r'_i r'_j ∂_i ∂_j V(r) + ... \n\nThen integrating over r':\n\n∫ ρ(r') [V(r) + r' · ∇V(r) + (1/6) ∇²V(r) r'² + ... ] d³r'\n\n= V(r) ∫ ρ(r') d³r' + ∇V(r) · ∫ r' ρ(r') d³r' + (1/6) ∇²V(r) ∫ r'² ρ(r') d³r' + ... \n\nNow, for a neutral charge distribution, the first term would be zero if we are considering the potential energy in an external field. However, here we are considering the potential energy of a charged sphere in the Coulomb potential of the nucleus. \n\nBut the sphere is not neutral; it's a uniformly charged sphere. Let me assume that the total charge is -e. Then ∫ ρ(r') d³r' = -e. \n\nThe second term involves ∫ r' ρ(r') d³r', which is the dipole moment. For a spherically symmetric charge distribution, this is zero. Therefore, the second term vanishes. \n\nThe third term is (1/6) ∇²V(r) ∫ r'² ρ(r') d³r'. For a uniform sphere of radius r₀ and total charge -e, ρ(r') = -3e/(4π r₀³) for |r'| ≤ r₀. \n\nTherefore, ∫ r'² ρ(r') d³r' = -3e/(4π r₀³) ∫_{0}^{r₀} r'² * r'² 4π dr' = -3e/(4π r₀³) * 4π ∫₀^{r₀} r'^4 dr' \n\n= -3e / r₀³ * [r'^5 / 5] from 0 to r₀ = -3e / r₀³ * (r₀^5 / 5) = -3e r₀² / 5 \n\nTherefore, the third term is (1/6) ∇²V(r) * (-3e r₀² / 5) = - (e r₀² / 10) ∇²V(r). \n\nBut the potential energy is then approximately:\n\nU(r) ≈ (-e) V(r) - (e r₀² / 10) ∇²V(r) + ... \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r). But according to this expansion, it's -e V(r) - (e r₀² / 10) ∇²V(r). \n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as U(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ... So there is a discrepancy here. \n\nBut in the problem statement, the potential energy is given as U(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ..., where V(r) is the external potential. However, according to the expansion I just did, if the charge is -e, then the potential energy is -e [V(r) + (r₀² / 10) ∇²V(r) + ...]. Therefore, the problem's expression seems to have omitted the factor of -e. \n\nBut maybe in the problem's context, they are considering the potential energy as just the expansion term without the charge? Or maybe there is a different convention. \n\nGiven that the problem says the potential energy is U(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ..., I have to go with that. Therefore, the perturbation is (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r). \n\nBut in reality, the expansion should have a coefficient depending on the charge distribution. However, since the problem specifies this coefficient, we proceed. \n\nBut then, as before, the perturbation is proportional to δ³(r), and for the 2p state, the expectation value is zero. \n\nTherefore, according to this model, the Lamb shift for the 2p level is zero. \n\nBut maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that even though the wave function is zero at the origin, there is some other contribution? For example, if the perturbation is not just δ³(r), but has other terms? \n\nBut according to the given U(r), the perturbation is only the Laplacian term. If the Laplacian term gives zero, then the answer is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing ∇²V(r)? Let me check again. \n\nGiven V(r) = -e² / r. \n\n∇²(1/r) = -4π δ³(r). Therefore, ∇²V(r) = -e² ∇²(1/r) = -e² (-4π δ³(r)) = 4π e² δ³(r). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, H' = (r₀² / 6) * 4π e² δ³(r) = (2π e² r₀² / 3) δ³(r). \n\nTherefore, ΔE = ⟨ψ_{2p}| H' |ψ_{2p}⟩ = (2π e² r₀² / 3) |ψ(0)|² = 0. \n\nSo the Lamb shift is zero. \n\nBut the problem says \"the Lamb shift can be considered as a minute correction to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom due to this property of real electrons.\" If it's zero for 2p, then maybe the question is testing whether I recognize that it's zero? \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different approach. For example, maybe the perturbation is not δ³(r), but something else? \n\nWait, let's think again. The potential energy of the sphere is U = ∫ ρ V d³r, where ρ is the charge density of the sphere. If the sphere is small, we can expand V(r) around the center of the sphere. Let me denote the center of the sphere as R, and the position within the sphere as r' relative to R. Then, V(r' + R) ≈ V(R) + r' · ∇V(R) + (1/2) r'_i r'_j ∂_i ∂_j V(R) + ... \n\nTherefore, the potential energy is ∫ ρ(r') [V(R) + r' · ∇V(R) + (1/6) ∇²V(R) r'² + ... ] d³r'. \n\nAs before, the first term is V(R) ∫ ρ(r') d³r' = V(R) * Q, where Q is the total charge. \n\nThe second term is ∇V(R) · ∫ r' ρ(r') d³r' = ∇V(R) · p, where p is the dipole moment. For a spherically symmetric charge distribution, p = 0. \n\nThe third term is (1/6) ∇²V(R) ∫ r'² ρ(r') d³r'. \n\nTherefore, if the charge distribution is spherically symmetric, then the potential energy is approximately Q V(R) + (1/6) ∇²V(R) ∫ r'² ρ(r') d³r' + ... \n\nBut in our case, the charge is that of the electron, which is -e. Therefore, Q = -e. \n\nTherefore, the potential energy is approximately -e V(R) + (1/6) ∇²V(R) ∫ r'² ρ(r') d³r' + ... \n\nBut in the problem statement, the potential energy is written as U(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ... \n\nComparing, it seems that the problem is considering the potential energy as U(r) = V(r) + ... without the charge factor. Perhaps there is a sign error or missing charge factor. \n\nBut given the problem's expression, we need to use it as given. However, if we use the correct expansion, then the perturbation would be the second term, which is (1/6) ∇²V(R) ∫ r'² ρ(r') d³r'. \n\nFor a uniform sphere of radius r₀ with charge -e, ∫ r'² ρ(r') d³r' = -3e r₀² / 5 as calculated earlier. \n\nTherefore, the perturbation would be (1/6) ∇²V(R) * (-3e r₀² / 5) = - (e r₀² / 10) ∇²V(R). \n\nTherefore, the total potential energy is approximately -e V(R) - (e r₀² / 10) ∇²V(R). \n\nComparing to the unperturbed potential energy, which would be -e V(R), the perturbation is - (e r₀² / 10) ∇²V(R). \n\nTherefore, the perturbation Hamiltonian is H' = - (e r₀² / 10) ∇²V(r). \n\nGiven that V(r) = -e² / r, then ∇²V(r) = 4π e² δ³(r), as before. \n\nTherefore, H' = - (e r₀² / 10) * 4π e² δ³(r) = - (2π e³ r₀² / 5) δ³(r). \n\nTherefore, the energy shift is ⟨ψ_{2p}| H' |ψ_{2p}⟩ = - (2π e³ r₀² / 5) |ψ(0)|² = 0. \n\nStill zero. \n\nBut according to the problem's expression, the perturbation is (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r). If we use that, then H' = (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) = (r₀² / 6) * 4π e² δ³(r) = (2π e² r₀² / 3) δ³(r). But in reality, the correct coefficient depends on the charge distribution. \n\nHowever, since the problem gives U(r) = V(r) + (r₀² / 6) ∇²V(r) + ..., and says that the r₀² term is a small perturbation, we must proceed with that. Therefore, even though in reality the coefficient might be different, we use what is given. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion remains that the energy shift is zero for the 2p level. \n\nBut maybe the problem is not considering the delta function? Maybe there is a mistake in calculating ∇²V(r)? \n\nWait, let me calculate ∇²V(r) again. Given V(r) = -e² / r. \n\n∇²(1/r) = -4π δ³(r). Therefore, ∇²V(r) = -e² ∇²(1/r) = -e² (-4π δ³(r)) = 4π e² δ³(r). Correct. \n\nTherefore, H' is proportional to δ³(r). Therefore, the expectation value is zero for 2p. \n\nTherefore, the answer is zero. \n\nBut maybe the problem is in Gaussian units or something else? The given potential is V(r) = -e² / r. In SI units, the Coulomb potential is -e² / (4πε₀ r), but the problem uses this form. Assuming it's in Gaussian units or something where constants are absorbed. \n\nBut regardless, the calculation shows zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given wave function is not correctly normalized? Let me check the normalization of the given wave function. \n\nThe given ψ_{2p}(r) = 2 a₀^{-5/2} r e^{-r/(2a₀)} Y₁^m / sqrt(24). \n\nTo check normalization, we need to integrate |ψ|² over all space. \n\nThe normalization integral is ∫ |ψ|² d³r = |2 a₀^{-5/2} / sqrt(24)|² ∫ r² e^{-r/a₀} |Y₁^m|² dr dΩ. \n\nSince Y₁^m are normalized, ∫ |Y₁^m|² dΩ = 1. \n\nTherefore, the radial integral is ∫₀^∞ r² * r² e^{-r/a₀} dr = ∫₀^∞ r^4 e^{-r/a₀} dr. \n\nLet me compute this integral. Let x = r/a₀, so r = a₀ x, dr = a₀ dx. \n\nIntegral becomes (a₀^5) ∫₀^∞ x^4 e^{-x} dx = a₀^5 Γ(5) = a₀^5 * 4! = 24 a₀^5. \n\nTherefore, the radial integral is 24 a₀^5. \n\nTherefore, the normalization factor squared is [4 a₀^{-5} / 24] * 24 a₀^5 = 4. \n\nWait, let me compute step by step. \n\nThe coefficient is 2 a₀^{-5/2} / sqrt(24). Squared is 4 a₀^{-5} / 24. \n\nMultiply by the radial integral 24 a₀^5: \n\n(4 a₀^{-5} / 24) * 24 a₀^5 = 4. \n\nBut the total normalization integral should be 1. Therefore, there is a discrepancy. \n\nAh, so the given wave function is not normalized? Let me check again. \n\nThe given ψ_{2p}(r) is 2 a₀^{-5/2} r e^{-r/(2a₀)} Y₁^m / sqrt(24). \n\nLet me compute the normalization:\n\n|ψ|² = [2 a₀^{-5/2} / sqrt(24)]² * r² e^{-r/a₀} * |Y₁^m|² \n\nIntegral over all space: [4 a₀^{-5} / 24] * ∫ r² e^{-r/a₀} * r² dr ∫ |Y₁^m|² dΩ \n\n= [4 / (24 a₀^5)] * ∫₀^∞ r^4 e^{-r/a₀} dr * 1 \n\nAs before, ∫₀^∞ r^4 e^{-r/a₀} dr = 24 a₀^5 \n\nSo total integral is [4 / (24 a₀^5)] * 24 a₀^5 = 4. \n\nBut this should equal 1. Therefore, there is a mistake in the given wave function's normalization. The coefficient should be such that when squared and multiplied by the integral, gives 1. Currently, it gives 4. Therefore, the correct normalization would have the coefficient squared as 1/4 of what it is. \n\nTherefore, the given wave function is not properly normalized. Perhaps there is a typo in the problem? Or maybe I made a mistake in calculation? \n\nLet me check the standard hydrogen wave functions. The 2p wave function has the form R_{2p}(r) Y₁^m(θ, φ). The radial part for 2p is R_{2,1}(r) = (1/(√(24) a₀^{3/2})) (r/a₀) e^{-r/(2a₀)}. \n\nTherefore, the full wave function is ψ_{2p} = R_{2,1}(r) Y₁^m = [1/(√(24) a₀^{3/2})] (r/a₀) e^{-r/(2a₀)} Y₁^m. \n\nSimplify this: \n\n= [1/(√(24) a₀^{5/2})] r e^{-r/(2a₀)} Y₁^m. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 1/(√(24) a₀^{5/2}), whereas the given wave function in the problem has coefficient 2 / (sqrt(24) a₀^{5/2}). Therefore, the given wave function is sqrt(4) times larger than the correct one, leading to the normalization integral being 4 instead of 1. \n\nTherefore, there is a mistake in the given wave function's coefficient. It should be 1/sqrt(24) a₀^{-5/2} instead of 2/sqrt(24) a₀^{-5/2}. Assuming that this is a typo in the problem, and the correct coefficient is 1/sqrt(24) a₀^{-5/2}, then the normalization would be correct. \n\nHowever, even with this correction, the wave function is still proportional to r, so ψ(0) = 0. Therefore, the expectation value of δ³(r) is still zero. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the normalization, the expectation value is zero. \n\nThus, the conclusion is that the Lamb shift for the 2p level, as modeled by this perturbation, is zero. \n\nBut the problem asks to \"determine the Lamb shift for the 2p energy level of the hydrogen atom, and express the result in terms of r₀ and some fundamental constants.\" If it's zero, then the answer is zero. But maybe I missed something? \n\nWait, let me think again. Perhaps the expansion is not just for the average potential, but includes a different term? For example, if the electron's finite size leads to a screening effect or something else? But according to the problem's setup, it's modeled as the Laplacian term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different term in the expansion? For example, if the potential energy expansion includes terms beyond the Laplacian? For instance, if there is a term involving ∇V(r), but for a spherically symmetric charge distribution, that term is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the perturbation is not the Laplacian term but something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given wave function is for the 2s state? Let me check. The standard 2s wave function has a radial part proportional to (2 - r/a₀) e^{-r/(2a₀)}, which has a non-zero value at r=0. If the problem mistakenly labeled the wave function as 2p instead of 2s, then the calculation would give a non-zero result. \n\nLet me check the given wave function again: ψ_{2p}(r) = 2 a₀^{-5/2} r e^{-r/(2a₀)} Y₁^m / sqrt(24). \n\nThis is indeed the 2p wave function, since it has an r term and Y₁^m. The 2s wave function would have a (2 - r/a₀) term. Therefore, the given wave function is correct for 2p. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion remains that the Lamb shift for the 2p level in this model is zero. \n\nBut since the problem is asking to express the result in terms of r₀ and fundamental constants, maybe I need to write ΔE = 0? Or is there a different approach? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that even though the wave function is zero at the origin, there is a non-zero contribution due to the finite size of the electron? For example, integrating over a finite region? \n\nBut according to the given U(r), the perturbation is expressed as a delta function term. If the perturbation were instead a finite range term, like a Yukawa potential or something else, then there might be a non-zero contribution. But according to the problem's setup, it's modeled as the Laplacian term, which is a delta function. \n\nTherefore, unless there is a miscalculation, the answer is zero. \n\nBut given that the problem is about the Lamb shift, which in reality is a small difference between 2s and 2p levels, and here it's modeled as this perturbation, which gives zero for 2p, it's possible that the answer is zero. \n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I think the Lamb shift for the 2p level in this model is zero. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe Lamb shift for the 2p energy level is \\boxed{0}.\n</think>"}
