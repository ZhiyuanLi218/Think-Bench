The problem mentions using Ehrenfest's theorem, which I remember relates the time evolution of expectation values of quantum operators to the commutators with the Hamiltonian. Let me start by recalling what Ehrenfest's theorem actually states.\n\nEhrenfest's theorem says that the time derivative of the expectation value of an operator A is equal to the expectation value of the commutator of A with the Hamiltonian divided by iħ, plus the expectation value of the partial derivative of A with respect to time. Mathematically, that's:\n\nd⟨A⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[A, H]⟩ + ⟨∂A/∂t⟩\n\nIn this problem, since the Hamiltonian doesn't explicitly depend on time, the second term is zero. So, for any operator A, the time derivative of its expectation value is just (1/iħ)⟨[A, H]⟩.\n\nNow, the electron is in a uniform magnetic field along the z-axis. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is given by H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnetic field. For an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is related to the Bohr magneton, but maybe the exact value isn't needed here. Since the magnetic field is along the z-axis, we can write H = -γ B S_z. However, for an electron, the spin magnetic moment is μ = -γ S, so the Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B. But maybe I need to be careful with signs here.\n\nWait, actually, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -γ B · S. For electrons, γ is positive? Wait, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -γ S, so H = -μ · B = γ B · S. Let me check that again. The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is U = -μ · B. For an electron, the magnetic moment is μ = -γ S, so substituting that in, U = -(-γ S) · B = γ S · B. Therefore, H = γ B · S. Since the magnetic field is along the z-axis, H = γ B S_z. But maybe there's a factor of 2 due to the gyromagnetic ratio for electrons? Wait, the gyromagnetic ratio for electrons is γ = -g_e μ_B / ħ, where g_e is the electron g-factor (~2). But maybe for the purposes of this problem, the exact value isn't necessary, and I can just take H proportional to S_z.\n\nSo, let me denote H = ω S_z, where ω is some constant related to γ and B. The exact value might not be needed because we might be dealing with angular frequencies or something. Anyway, the key is that the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_z.\n\nNow, the initial state of the electron is such that its spin is along the positive x-axis. So at t=0, the spin is in the eigenstate of S_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_x are (|+x⟩) = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩)/√2 and (|−x⟩) = (|+z⟩ − |−z⟩)/√2. Since the spin is along positive x, the initial state is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+x⟩.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the electron is in the state S_y = 1/2 at time t > 0. Wait, S_y = 1/2? Actually, the eigenvalues of S_y are ±ħ/2. So maybe the problem is using units where ħ = 1? Or maybe it's a typo and they mean the eigenvalue is +ħ/2? Since in standard units, the spin component operators have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. However, sometimes in quantum mechanics, people use units where ħ = 1, so S_x, S_y, S_z have eigenvalues ±1/2. The problem says \"the electron's spin is directed along the positive x-axis\", so maybe they are using the standard eigenvalues. But the question says \"S_y = 1/2\", so perhaps they are using units where ħ = 1? Let me check.\n\nIn any case, the probability of finding the electron in the S_y = +ħ/2 state (or S_y = 1/2 if ħ=1) at time t can be found by evolving the initial state under the Hamiltonian and then projecting onto the S_y eigenstate.\n\nHowever, the problem says to use Ehrenfest's theorem. So maybe instead of solving the Schrödinger equation directly, we need to use Ehrenfest's theorem to find the time evolution of the expectation values of S_x, S_y, S_z, and then perhaps relate that to the probability?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use Ehrenfest's theorem to derive the equations of motion for the spin components and then solve those equations to find the time evolution of the state?\n\nLet me recall that for spin in a magnetic field, the expectation values of the spin components precess around the magnetic field direction, according to the Bloch equations or something similar. So, using Ehrenfest's theorem, we can derive the equations of motion for ⟨S_x⟩, ⟨S_y⟩, ⟨S_z⟩.\n\nGiven that, if we can find ⟨S_y⟩(t), which is related to the probability of measuring S_y = +ħ/2? Wait, not exactly. The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is the average value of S_y, but the probability of measuring S_y = +ħ/2 is given by |⟨+y|ψ(t)⟩|². However, maybe if we can find the time evolution of the state, or perhaps relate ⟨S_y⟩ to the probability?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the initial state is an eigenstate of S_x, and the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_z, we can find the time evolution of the state and then compute the overlap with the S_y eigenstate.\n\nBut the problem says to use Ehrenfest's theorem. Maybe the idea is to use Ehrenfest's theorem to find the equations of motion for the spin components, solve them, and then use those to find the probability?\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's write down the Hamiltonian. Let me define H = ω S_z, where ω is a constant (including factors like γ and B). The exact value of ω might not matter for the probability, as we might be interested in the time dependence.\n\nNow, using Ehrenfest's theorem, let's compute d⟨S_x⟩/dt, d⟨S_y⟩/dt, and d⟨S_z⟩/dt.\n\nStarting with d⟨S_x⟩/dt:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, H]⟩\n\nSince H = ω S_z, this becomes:\n\n= (ω/iħ)⟨[S_x, S_z]⟩\n\nRecall that [S_x, S_z] = -iħ S_y. Therefore:\n\n= (ω/iħ)(-iħ)⟨S_y⟩ = ω ⟨S_y⟩\n\nSimilarly, compute d⟨S_y⟩/dt:\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S_y, H]⟩ = (ω/iħ)⟨[S_y, S_z]⟩\n\n[S_y, S_z] = iħ S_x, so:\n\n= (ω/iħ)(iħ)⟨S_x⟩ = -ω ⟨S_x⟩\n\nAnd d⟨S_z⟩/dt:\n\nd⟨S_z⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, H]⟩ = (ω/iħ)⟨[S_z, S_z]⟩ = 0\n\nSo the three equations are:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = ω ⟨S_y⟩\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = -ω ⟨S_x⟩\n\nd⟨S_z⟩/dt = 0\n\nThese are the equations of a simple harmonic oscillator, with solutions that represent precession around the z-axis.\n\nThe general solution for ⟨S_x⟩ and ⟨S_y⟩ can be found by solving these coupled differential equations.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nd²⟨S_x⟩/dt² = ω d⟨S_y⟩/dt = -ω² ⟨S_x⟩\n\nSimilarly for ⟨S_y⟩. So the solutions are sinusoidal functions.\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = ⟨S_x⟩(0) cos(ω t) - ⟨S_y⟩(0) sin(ω t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = ⟨S_y⟩(0) cos(ω t) + ⟨S_x⟩(0) sin(ω t)\n\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨S_z⟩(0)\n\nNow, let's determine the initial conditions. At t=0, the electron is in the state |+x⟩. Therefore, ⟨S_x⟩(0) = ⟨+x| S_x |+x⟩ = +ħ/2 (assuming units where ħ=1? Wait, the problem didn't specify units. Hmm.)\n\nWait, let me be precise. The spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The state |+x⟩ is an eigenstate of S_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, ⟨S_x⟩(0) = +ħ/2, ⟨S_y⟩(0) = 0, ⟨S_z⟩(0) = 0. Because in the |+x⟩ state, the expectation value of S_y is zero, since it's an equal superposition of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩, which have opposite S_y values.\n\nTherefore, substituting the initial conditions:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(ω t) - 0 = (ħ/2) cos(ω t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = 0 * cos(ω t) + (ħ/2) sin(ω t) = (ħ/2) sin(ω t)\n\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = 0\n\nSo, the expectation values of S_x and S_y precess in the x-y plane with angular frequency ω.\n\nBut how does this help us find the probability that the electron is in the state S_y = +ħ/2?\n\nWell, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is related to the difference in probabilities of measuring +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Specifically, ⟨S_y⟩ = (+ħ/2) P(+ħ/2) + (-ħ/2) P(-ħ/2). Since the total probability is 1, P(+ħ/2) + P(-ħ/2) = 1. Let me denote P_+ = P(+ħ/2), P_- = P(-ħ/2). Then:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (+ħ/2) P_+ + (-ħ/2) P_- = (ħ/2)(P_+ - P_-)\n\nBut since P_+ + P_- = 1, we can write:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(2 P_+ - 1)\n\nTherefore, solving for P_+:\n\n2 P_+ - 1 = (2/ħ) ⟨S_y⟩\n\nTherefore:\n\nP_+ = 1/2 + (1/ħ) ⟨S_y⟩\n\nGiven that ⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(ω t), substituting:\n\nP_+ = 1/2 + (1/ħ)(ħ/2) sin(ω t) = 1/2 + (1/2) sin(ω t) = [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring S_y = +ħ/2 at time t is [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\nBut wait, let me check the algebra again.\n\nStarting with:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(P_+ - P_-)\n\nBut since P_+ + P_- = 1, we can write P_- = 1 - P_+.\n\nTherefore:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(P_+ - (1 - P_+)) = (ħ/2)(2 P_+ - 1)\n\nTherefore, solving for P_+:\n\n2 P_+ - 1 = (2/ħ) ⟨S_y⟩\n\n=> 2 P_+ = 1 + (2/ħ) ⟨S_y⟩\n\n=> P_+ = 1/2 + (1/ħ) ⟨S_y⟩\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nGiven that ⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(ω t), then:\n\nP_+ = 1/2 + (1/ħ)*(ħ/2) sin(ω t) = 1/2 + (1/2) sin(ω t) = [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\nSo the probability is [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\nBut what is ω here? Recall that ω came from the Hamiltonian H = ω S_z. Earlier, we had H = γ B S_z. So ω = γ B. For an electron, γ is related to the gyromagnetic ratio, which is γ = -g_e μ_B / ħ, but since H is proportional to S_z, and the sign depends on the direction of the magnetic field. However, since we are dealing with the magnitude of the precession frequency, perhaps the exact sign isn't important here. But in our equations, the sign of ω would affect the direction of precession. However, since we have the equations d⟨S_x⟩/dt = ω ⟨S_y⟩ and d⟨S_y⟩/dt = -ω ⟨S_x⟩, which leads to the solutions with cos(ω t) and sin(ω t). If ω were negative, we would have cos(|ω| t) and sin(-|ω| t), but since sin is odd, it would be -sin(|ω| t). However, our initial conditions are ⟨S_x⟩(0) = ħ/2, ⟨S_y⟩(0) = 0. So regardless of the sign of ω, the solution would be ⟨S_x⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(ω t), ⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(ω t) if ω is positive. If ω were negative, it would be ⟨S_y⟩(t) = - (ħ/2) sin(|ω| t). However, in our case, the magnetic field is along the positive z-axis. For an electron, which has negative charge, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is negative. Wait, let me think.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is μ = -γ S, so H = -(-γ S) · B = γ S · B. For an electron, γ is positive? Wait, let me recall that the gyromagnetic ratio γ is defined as μ = γ S. For the electron, μ is opposite to S because the electron has negative charge. Therefore, μ = -g_e (μ_B / ħ) S. Therefore, γ = -g_e μ_B / ħ. Since g_e ≈ 2, and μ_B is positive, γ is negative. Therefore, H = γ B S_z is negative times B times S_z. Therefore, ω is negative. However, in our equations, we had written H = ω S_z, so ω is negative. Therefore, the equations of motion would be:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = ω ⟨S_y⟩\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = -ω ⟨S_x⟩\n\nBut if ω is negative, let's denote ω = -|ω|, then:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = -|ω| ⟨S_y⟩\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = |ω| ⟨S_x⟩\n\nWhich would lead to solutions:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = ⟨S_x⟩(0) cos(|ω| t) + ⟨S_y⟩(0) sin(|ω| t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = -⟨S_y⟩(0) cos(|ω| t) + ⟨S_x⟩(0) sin(|ω| t)\n\nBut in our case, ⟨S_y⟩(0) = 0, so:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = ⟨S_x⟩(0) cos(|ω| t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = ⟨S_x⟩(0) sin(|ω| t)\n\nWhich is the same as before, except with |ω| instead of ω. Therefore, regardless of the sign, the magnitude of the frequency is what matters. So in terms of the probability, since sin(ω t) would be sin(-|ω| t) = -sin(|ω| t), but since we have [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2, if ω is negative, it would be [1 - sin(|ω| t)] / 2. Wait, but this contradicts our previous result. What's going on here?\n\nWait, let me check again. If ω is negative, then our solution for ⟨S_y⟩(t) would be:\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(ω t) = (ħ/2) sin(-|ω| t) = - (ħ/2) sin(|ω| t)\n\nTherefore, P_+ = [1 + (- sin(|ω| t))]/2 = [1 - sin(|ω| t)] / 2.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier result. So which one is correct?\n\nThis suggests that the sign of ω affects the result. Therefore, I need to be careful with the sign.\n\nLet me retrace the steps. The Hamiltonian is H = γ B S_z. For an electron, γ is negative because μ = -γ S. Let me recall that the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = γ S. For an electron, μ is opposite to S because the electron has negative charge. Therefore, μ = -g_e (μ_B / ħ) S. Therefore, γ = -g_e μ_B / ħ. Since g_e is positive (~2), γ is negative. Therefore, H = γ B S_z is negative times B times S_z. Therefore, ω = γ B is negative.\n\nTherefore, in the equations of motion, we have:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = ω ⟨S_y⟩ (with ω negative)\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = -ω ⟨S_x⟩ (with ω negative, so -ω is positive)\n\nTherefore, the system of equations is:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = -|ω| ⟨S_y⟩\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = +|ω| ⟨S_x⟩\n\nWhich is a system of equations that has solutions:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = ⟨S_x⟩(0) cos(|ω| t) + ⟨S_y⟩(0) sin(|ω| t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = -⟨S_y⟩(0) cos(|ω| t) + ⟨S_x⟩(0) sin(|ω| t)\n\nGiven that ⟨S_y⟩(0) = 0 and ⟨S_x⟩(0) = ħ/2, we get:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(|ω| t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(|ω| t)\n\nWait, but according to the equations above, ⟨S_y⟩(t) = -⟨S_y⟩(0) cos(...) + ⟨S_x⟩(0) sin(...). Since ⟨S_y⟩(0) = 0, it's just ⟨S_x⟩(0) sin(...). Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(|ω| t). Therefore, even though ω is negative, because we have sin(ω t) = sin(-|ω| t) = -sin(|ω| t), but in our derivation using the equations of motion with ω negative, we get ⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(|ω| t). Therefore, there is a discrepancy here. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me rederive the equations of motion with ω negative. Let me denote ω = -Ω, where Ω is positive. Then:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = ω ⟨S_y⟩ = -Ω ⟨S_y⟩\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = -ω ⟨S_x⟩ = +Ω ⟨S_x⟩\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = -Ω ⟨S_y⟩\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = +Ω ⟨S_x⟩\n\nThis is a standard coupled system, whose solutions are:\n\nLet me write this as a matrix equation:\n\nd/dt [⟨S_x⟩, ⟨S_y⟩]^T = [ [0, -Ω], [Ω, 0] ] [⟨S_x⟩, ⟨S_y⟩]^T\n\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix are ±iΩ, leading to solutions involving e^{±iΩ t}. Therefore, the general solution is:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = A cos(Ω t) + B sin(Ω t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = C cos(Ω t) + D sin(Ω t)\n\nBut applying the differential equations:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = -Ω ⟨S_y⟩\n\nSo:\n\n- A Ω sin(Ω t) + B Ω cos(Ω t) = -Ω [C cos(Ω t) + D sin(Ω t)]\n\nDividing both sides by Ω:\n\n- A sin(Ω t) + B cos(Ω t) = -C cos(Ω t) - D sin(Ω t)\n\nTherefore, equating coefficients:\n\nFor sin(Ω t): -A = -D => D = A\n\nFor cos(Ω t): B = -C => C = -B\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\nd⟨S_y⟩/dt = +Ω ⟨S_x⟩:\n\n- C Ω sin(Ω t) + D Ω cos(Ω t) = Ω [A cos(Ω t) + B sin(Ω t)]\n\nDivide by Ω:\n\n- C sin(Ω t) + D cos(Ω t) = A cos(Ω t) + B sin(Ω t)\n\nSubstituting C = -B and D = A:\n\n-(-B) sin(Ω t) + A cos(Ω t) = A cos(Ω t) + B sin(Ω t)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nB sin(Ω t) + A cos(Ω t) = A cos(Ω t) + B sin(Ω t)\n\nWhich holds true. Therefore, the general solution can be written as:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = A cos(Ω t) + B sin(Ω t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = -B cos(Ω t) + A sin(Ω t)\n\nApplying initial conditions:\n\nAt t=0, ⟨S_x⟩(0) = A = ħ/2\n\n⟨S_y⟩(0) = -B = 0 => B = 0\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n⟨S_x⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(Ω t)\n\n⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(Ω t)\n\nTherefore, even though ω is negative, the solution ends up with ⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(Ω t), where Ω = |ω|. Therefore, the probability P_+ is:\n\nP_+ = [1 + (⟨S_y⟩(t) / (ħ/2))]/2 = [1 + sin(Ω t)] / 2\n\nTherefore, the probability is [1 + sin(Ω t)] / 2, where Ω is the magnitude of ω, i.e., Ω = |γ| B. Therefore, the sign of ω doesn't affect the final probability expression because we end up with sin(Ω t).\n\nTherefore, the answer is [1 + sin(Ω t)] / 2. However, the problem didn't give specific values for the magnetic field or the gyromagnetic ratio, so we need to express Ω in terms of known constants or perhaps leave it in terms of ω. But since the problem says to use Ehrenfest's theorem and didn't specify particular values, maybe we can just leave it in terms of ω? However, perhaps we need to express ω in terms of the physical parameters.\n\nBut the problem might expect an answer in terms of the Larmor frequency or something similar. However, since the problem didn't give numerical values, perhaps we need to relate ω to the Hamiltonian.\n\nAlternatively, since we were told to use Ehrenfest's theorem, and we have derived the probability as [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2, where ω is the coefficient from the Hamiltonian H = ω S_z. However, since the actual value of ω depends on the magnetic field and the gyromagnetic ratio, which are not given here, maybe we need to express ω in terms of the given parameters?\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide specific values for the magnetic field or the gyromagnetic ratio. Therefore, perhaps we need to express the answer in terms of the Larmor frequency, or just leave it as is? However, since the problem says \"calculate the probability\", maybe there is an expectation to write it in terms of the time and some constants?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different approach where we can find the time evolution of the state directly, using the Schrödinger equation, and then compute the probability.\n\nLet me try that approach to verify.\n\nThe initial state is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+x⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩)/√2.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = ω S_z. Let me define ω as before. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Assuming units where ħ=1, which might be the case here since the problem mentions S_y = 1/2, which suggests ħ=1. Let me check.\n\nIf we take ħ=1, then S_x, S_y, S_z have eigenvalues ±1/2. The Hamiltonian H = ω S_z. Then, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i ω S_z t). Let's apply this to the initial state |+x⟩.\n\nFirst, express |+x⟩ in the z-basis:\n\n|+x⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩)/√2\n\nApplying U(t):\n\n|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |+x⟩ = [exp(-i ω (1/2) t) |+z⟩ + exp(-i ω (-1/2) t) |−z⟩]/√2\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\n= [exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z⟩ + exp(+i ω t / 2) |−z⟩]/√2\n\nThis can be rewritten using Euler's formula:\n\n= [cos(ω t / 2) |+z⟩ - i sin(ω t / 2) |+z⟩ + cos(ω t / 2) |−z⟩ + i sin(ω t / 2) |−z⟩]/√2\n\nWait, actually, more straightforwardly, we can write:\n\n|ψ(t)⟩ = [exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z⟩ + exp(+i ω t / 2) |−z⟩]/√2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that this state is in the S_y = +1/2 state. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Let me recall that |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩)/√2 and |−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |−z⟩)/√2.\n\nTherefore, the probability P_+ is |⟨+y|ψ(t)⟩|².\n\nCompute the inner product:\n\n⟨+y|ψ(t)⟩ = [⟨+z| + (-i) ⟨−z|]/√2 · [exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z⟩ + exp(+i ω t / 2) |−z⟩]/√2\n\nMultiplying out:\n\n= [⟨+z| exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z⟩ + ⟨+z| exp(+i ω t / 2) |−z⟩ - i ⟨−z| exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z⟩ - i ⟨−z| exp(+i ω t / 2) |−z⟩ ] / 2\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\nFirst term: ⟨+z|+z⟩ exp(-i ω t / 2) = exp(-i ω t / 2)\n\nSecond term: ⟨+z|−z⟩ exp(+i ω t / 2) = 0\n\nThird term: -i ⟨−z|+z⟩ exp(-i ω t / 2) = 0\n\nFourth term: -i ⟨−z|−z⟩ exp(+i ω t / 2) = -i exp(+i ω t / 2)\n\nTherefore:\n\n⟨+y|ψ(t)⟩ = [exp(-i ω t / 2) - i exp(+i ω t / 2)] / 2\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\nLet me factor out exp(-i ω t / 2):\n\n= [exp(-i ω t / 2) - i exp(+i ω t / 2)] / 2\n\nAlternatively, write both terms with exp(-i ω t / 2):\n\nNote that exp(+i ω t / 2) = exp(i ω t) exp(-i ω t / 2). Therefore:\n\n= [exp(-i ω t / 2) - i exp(i ω t) exp(-i ω t / 2)] / 2\n\n= exp(-i ω t / 2) [1 - i exp(i ω t)] / 2\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute directly:\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\nexp(-i ω t / 2) - i exp(+i ω t / 2)\n\nLet me write both terms in terms of sine and cosine:\n\nexp(-i ω t / 2) = cos(ω t / 2) - i sin(ω t / 2)\n\nexp(+i ω t / 2) = cos(ω t / 2) + i sin(ω t / 2)\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumerator = [cos(ω t / 2) - i sin(ω t / 2)] - i [cos(ω t / 2) + i sin(ω t / 2)]\n\n= cos(ω t / 2) - i sin(ω t / 2) - i cos(ω t / 2) - i² sin(ω t / 2)\n\nSince i² = -1:\n\n= cos(ω t / 2) - i sin(ω t / 2) - i cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)\n\nGroup real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal: cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)\n\nImaginary: -i sin(ω t / 2) - i cos(ω t / 2) = -i [sin(ω t / 2) + cos(ω t / 2)]\n\nTherefore, the numerator is [cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)] - i [sin(ω t / 2) + cos(ω t / 2)]\n\nFactor out [cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)]:\n\n= [1 - i] [cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)]\n\nTherefore, ⟨+y|ψ(t)⟩ = [1 - i]/2 [cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)]\n\nNow, compute the modulus squared:\n\n|⟨+y|ψ(t)⟩|² = |[1 - i]/2|² |cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)|²\n\nFirst, |1 - i| = √(1² + (-1)²) = √2, so |[1 - i]/2|² = (2)/4 = 1/2.\n\nNext, |cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)|² = [cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)]²\n\nExpanding:\n\n= cos²(ω t / 2) + 2 sin(ω t / 2) cos(ω t / 2) + sin²(ω t / 2)\n\n= [cos² + sin²] + 2 sin cos\n\n= 1 + sin(ω t)\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n|⟨+y|ψ(t)⟩|² = (1/2)(1 + sin(ω t)) = [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2\n\nWhich matches the result we obtained using Ehrenfest's theorem! So this confirms that the probability is indeed [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\nTherefore, using both methods, we arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nBut let me check for specific cases. At t=0, sin(0) = 0, so the probability is 1/2. Which makes sense, because the initial state is |+x⟩, which is an equal superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩? Wait, no. Wait, |+x⟩ is not an equal superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Let me check.\n\nActually, the state |+x⟩ is (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩)/√2. The state |+y⟩ is (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩)/√2. Therefore, the overlap ⟨+y|+x⟩ is [⟨+z| + (-i)⟨−z|] [ |+z⟩ + |−z⟩ ] / 2 = [1 - i]/2, whose modulus squared is [1 + 1]/4 = 1/2. Therefore, yes, at t=0, the probability is 1/2, which matches [1 + sin(0)] / 2 = 1/2. Good.\n\nAnother check: at t = π/(2ω), sin(ω t) = sin(π/2) = 1, so the probability is [1 + 1]/2 = 1. That means at this time, the probability is 1. Let's see if that makes sense. At t = π/(2ω), the spin has precessed by π/2 radians. Starting from +x, precessing around z-axis by π/2. Let me visualize: if the spin is precessing around the z-axis, then rotating the initial +x direction by π/2 around z would bring it to +y direction. Therefore, at that time, the state should be |+y⟩, so the probability is 1. That matches. Similarly, at t = π/ω, sin(ω t) = sin(π) = 0, so probability is 1/2 again. At t = 3π/(2ω), sin(ω t) = -1, so probability is [1 - 1]/2 = 0, which means the state is |−y⟩. All these make sense.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"calculate the probability... for t > 0\". However, it doesn't specify a particular time, so maybe we need to leave it in terms of ω and t? But ω is related to the magnetic field and the gyromagnetic ratio. Since the problem didn't give specific values, maybe we need to express ω in terms of the physical parameters?\n\nLet me recall that for an electron, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is μ = -g_e (μ_B / ħ) S, where g_e ≈ 2 is the electron g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Therefore, H = -μ · B = g_e (μ_B / ħ) S · B. If the magnetic field is along the z-axis, then H = g_e (μ_B / ħ) B S_z. Therefore, ω = g_e (μ_B / ħ) B.\n\nBut unless the problem expects us to write the answer in terms of these constants, which are not provided, we might need to leave it in terms of ω. However, since the problem mentions \"use Ehrenfest's theorem\", and through that we derived the probability in terms of ω, which is the coefficient in the Hamiltonian, and since no specific values are given, I think the answer should be expressed as [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2, where ω is the Larmor frequency (the precession frequency of the spin in the magnetic field).\n\nBut let me check if there is a standard expression for ω in terms of the magnetic field. The Larmor frequency is given by ω = γ B, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For an electron, γ = -g_e μ_B / ħ. However, since we took absolute values earlier and found that the magnitude is what matters, we can write ω = |γ| B = (g_e μ_B / ħ) B. But again, unless the problem expects us to write it in terms of these constants, which are not given, we can't proceed further.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2, with ω being the Larmor frequency. However, the problem might want the answer expressed in terms of the physical parameters, but since they are not given, maybe we need to define ω in terms of the Hamiltonian? The problem says \"calculate the probability\", so perhaps we can just leave it in terms of ω?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a way to express ω using Ehrenfest's theorem results? From our earlier equations, we had the equations of motion which involved ω. But without additional information, I think it's acceptable to present the probability as [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says \"the electron's spin is directed along the positive x-axis\" at t=0. In standard quantum mechanics, this would mean that the initial state is |+x⟩, which we've considered. Therefore, using Ehrenfest's theorem, we derived the expectation values, then related them to the probability, and cross-verified with solving the Schrödinger equation directly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\nBut let me check if there's any missing factor or mistake in the derivation. For example, when we related ⟨S_y⟩ to the probability, we assumed units where ħ=1? Wait, in the first derivation using Ehrenfest's theorem, I considered the general case where the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. Then ⟨S_y⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(ω t). Then P_+ = 1/2 + (1/ħ)⟨S_y⟩ = 1/2 + (1/ħ)(ħ/2) sin(ω t) = 1/2 + 1/2 sin(ω t). So regardless of ħ, the result is [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2. Therefore, even if we don't set ħ=1, the factors cancel out. Therefore, the expression is correct in general.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\nBut the problem might want the answer expressed in terms of the time and the Larmor frequency, which is standard. However, since the problem didn't give numbers, this is as far as we can go.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the electron is in the state S_y = 1/2 at time t > 0 is [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2, where ω is the Larmor frequency given by the Hamiltonian H = ω S_z.\n\nBut the problem says \"calculate the probability\", so maybe we need to write it in terms of the given parameters? The problem mentions a uniform magnetic field along the positive z-axis. For an electron, the Larmor frequency is ω = (g_e e B)/(2m_e c) in Gaussian units, or something similar. However, since the problem does not provide specific values for B or other constants, and since we are to use Ehrenfest's theorem, which we did to arrive at the expression [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2, I think that is the answer they expect.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that the Hamiltonian is H = ω S_z, then ω is given, and the answer is as above.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration and verification through two methods (Ehrenfest's theorem and direct Schrödinger equation solution), I conclude that the probability is [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1 + \\sin(\\omega t)}{2}}.\n</think>"}
