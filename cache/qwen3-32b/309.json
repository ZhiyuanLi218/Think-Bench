Let me see if there's a pattern or some kind of formula I can use here. The numbers in the numerators and denominators are increasing by 12 each time in the numerator and denominator separately. Let me check:\n\nNumerator terms: 10, 22, 34, 46, 58. The difference between each is 12. Denominator terms: 4, 16, 28, 40, 52. Also difference of 12. So maybe there's some telescoping product or something?\n\nI remember that expressions of the form $a^4 + 4b^4$ can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity. Let me recall that identity. It's:\n\n$$\na^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2).\n$$\n\nYes, that's right. So maybe I can factor each term in the numerator and denominator using this identity. Let me check if each term here fits that form. Let's take a general term in the numerator or denominator, say $x^4 + 324$. Let me write 324 as 4 times something. 324 divided by 4 is 81, which is 3^4. Wait, 3^4 is 81, so 4*(3^4) = 4*81 = 324. So yes! So each term in the numerator and denominator can be written as $x^4 + 4*(3^4)$, which fits the Sophie Germain identity with b=3. Therefore, we can factor each term as:\n\n$$\nx^4 + 324 = (x^2 + 2x*3 + 2*(3)^2)(x^2 - 2x*3 + 2*(3)^2) = (x^2 + 6x + 18)(x^2 - 6x + 18).\n$$\n\nGreat! So each term factors into two quadratics. So maybe if I factor each term in the numerator and denominator, there will be cancellation?\n\nLet me try writing out the numerator and denominator with this factorization.\n\nFirst, let's take the numerator:\n\nFor each term $ (x)^4 + 324 $, where x is 10, 22, 34, 46, 58:\n\n- For x=10: (10² + 6*10 + 18)(10² - 6*10 + 18) = (100 + 60 + 18)(100 - 60 + 18) = (178)(58)\n- For x=22: (22² + 132 + 18)(22² - 132 + 18) = (484 + 132 + 18)(484 - 132 + 18) = Let me compute that... 484 + 132 is 616 + 18 is 634; 484 - 132 is 352 + 18 is 370. So (634)(370)\n- Similarly for x=34: (34² + 204 + 18)(34² - 204 + 18). Let me compute 34² is 1156. 1156 + 204 is 1360 + 18 is 1378; 1156 - 204 is 952 + 18 is 970. So (1378)(970)\n- x=46: 46² is 2116. 2116 + 276 (which is 6*46) + 18: 2116 + 276 = 2392 + 18 = 2410; 2116 - 276 = 1840 + 18 = 1858. So (2410)(1858)\n- x=58: 58² is 3364. 6*58 is 348. 3364 + 348 = 3712 + 18 = 3730; 3364 - 348 = 3016 + 18 = 3034. So (3730)(3034)\n\nSo numerator factors into:\n\n(178*58)*(634*370)*(1378*970)*(2410*1858)*(3730*3034)\n\nSimilarly for denominator terms: each term is x^4 + 324 with x=4,16,28,40,52.\n\nLet me do the same factorization:\n\nFor x=4:\n\n(4² + 6*4 + 18)(4² - 6*4 + 18) = (16 + 24 + 18)(16 - 24 + 18) = (58)(10)\nFor x=16:\n\n(16² + 96 + 18)(16² - 96 + 18) = (256 + 96 + 18)(256 - 96 + 18) = (370)(178)\nFor x=28:\n\n(28² + 168 + 18)(28² - 168 + 18). 28² is 784. 784 + 168 = 952 + 18 = 970; 784 - 168 = 616 + 18 = 634. So (970)(634)\nFor x=40:\n\n(40² + 240 + 18)(40² - 240 + 18). 40²=1600. 1600 + 240 = 1840 + 18 = 1858; 1600 - 240 = 1360 + 18 = 1378. So (1858)(1378)\nFor x=52:\n\n(52² + 312 + 18)(52² - 312 + 18). 52² is 2704. 2704 + 312 = 3016 + 18 = 3034; 2704 - 312 = 2392 + 18 = 2410. So (3034)(2410)\n\nTherefore, the denominator factors into:\n\n(58*10)*(370*178)*(970*634)*(1858*1378)*(3034*2410)\n\nNow, let me write out numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:\n(178 * 58) * (634 * 370) * (1378 * 970) * (2410 * 1858) * (3730 * 3034)\n\nDenominator:\n(58 * 10) * (370 * 178) * (970 * 634) * (1858 * 1378) * (3034 * 2410)\n\nLooking at this, there is a lot of cancellation! Let me rearrange terms to see:\n\nLet me note that multiplication is commutative, so I can reorder the factors in numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator factors: 178, 58, 634, 370, 1378, 970, 2410, 1858, 3730, 3034\n\nDenominator factors: 58, 10, 370, 178, 970, 634, 1858, 1378, 3034, 2410\n\nSo if we pair them:\n\nNumerator: [178, 58, 634, 370, 1378, 970, 2410, 1858, 3730, 3034]\n\nDenominator: [58, 10, 370, 178, 970, 634, 1858, 1378, 3034, 2410]\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- 178 in numerator cancels with 178 in denominator\n- 58 in numerator cancels with 58 in denominator\n- 634 in numerator cancels with 634 in denominator\n- 370 in numerator cancels with 370 in denominator\n- 1378 in numerator cancels with 1378 in denominator\n- 970 in numerator cancels with 970 in denominator\n- 2410 in numerator cancels with 2410 in denominator\n- 1858 in numerator cancels with 1858 in denominator\n- 3034 in numerator cancels with 3034 in denominator\n\nAfter all that, we are left with only the numerator factor that doesn't have a counterpart in the denominator, which is 3730, and the denominator factor that doesn't have a counterpart in the numerator, which is 10. Therefore, the entire fraction simplifies to 3730 / 10 = 373.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal numerator factors after expansion: five pairs, each pair being (something)(something else). The denominator also five pairs. When expanding, the numerator has five pairs and denominator five pairs. After cancellation, only the last term in the numerator's first factor that didn't repeat?\n\nWait, let me check again step by step.\n\nLet me list numerator factors:\n\nTerm1: 178 * 58\n\nTerm2: 634 * 370\n\nTerm3: 1378 * 970\n\nTerm4: 2410 * 1858\n\nTerm5: 3730 * 3034\n\nDenominator factors:\n\nTerm1: 58 * 10\n\nTerm2: 370 * 178\n\nTerm3: 970 * 634\n\nTerm4: 1858 * 1378\n\nTerm5: 3034 * 2410\n\nSo if we write numerator as (178 * 58 * 634 * 370 * 1378 * 970 * 2410 * 1858 * 3730 * 3034) and denominator as (58 * 10 * 370 * 178 * 970 * 634 * 1858 * 1378 * 3034 * 2410). So indeed, all terms except 3730 in numerator and 10 in denominator cancel out. Therefore, the result is 3730 / 10 = 373.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify with actual numbers.\n\nLet me check for example the first terms:\n\nIn numerator: 178 and 58, in denominator: 58 and 10. So 178/10 after cancelling 58.\n\nBut actually, numerator has 178*58 and denominator has 58*10. So cancelling 58, we get 178 / 10. Similarly, numerator has 634*370 and denominator has 370*178. So cancelling 370, we get 634 / 178. Then numerator has 1378*970 and denominator has 970*634. So cancelling 970, get 1378 / 634. Then numerator has 2410*1858, denominator has 1858*1378, cancelling 1858, get 2410 / 1378. Then numerator has 3730*3034, denominator has 3034*2410, cancelling 3034, get 3730 / 2410. Then multiplying all these fractions together:\n\n(178 / 10) * (634 / 178) * (1378 / 634) * (2410 / 1378) * (3730 / 2410)\n\nAh, here we can see the telescoping! The 178 cancels between numerator of first and denominator of second. The 634 cancels between numerator of second and denominator of third. Similarly, 1378 cancels between numerator of third and denominator of fourth, 2410 cancels between numerator of fourth and denominator of fifth. So all that remains is 3730 / 10 = 373. Exactly. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the entire big fraction simplifies to 373. Let me check if that makes sense. Let me test with smaller numbers to see if the approach is correct.\n\nLet me take a simpler case. Suppose I have [(a^4 + 324)/(b^4 + 324)] where a and b differ by some amount. But maybe not necessary. Since the telescoping worked out here, and each step cancels properly, I think the answer is 373. But let me check with actual calculation for one term.\n\nFor example, take the first numerator term: 10^4 + 324. Let me compute 10^4 is 10000, plus 324 is 10324. Then factor into (10² + 6*10 + 18)(10² - 6*10 + 18) = (100 + 60 + 18)(100 - 60 + 18) = (178)(58). Let me compute 178*58. 178*50=8900, 178*8=1424, total 8900+1424=10324. Correct. Similarly for denominator term, 4^4 + 324 is 256 + 324 = 580. Which is (58)(10). 58*10=580. Correct. So the factoring works. Then the cancellation as per telescoping is valid. Therefore, the answer is 373.\n\nBut let me check with another term. Let me take the second numerator term: 22^4 + 324. 22^4 is 22*22*22*22. Let me compute 22² is 484, so 22^4 is 484². Let me compute 484². Well, (400 + 84)^2 = 400² + 2*400*84 + 84² = 160000 + 67200 + 7056 = 160000 + 67200 = 227200 + 7056 = 234,256. Then add 324: 234,256 + 324 = 234,580. Now, according to our factoring, it should be 634 * 370. Let me compute 634 * 370. Let me break it down: 600*370 + 34*370. 600*370 = 222,000. 34*370: 30*370=11,100; 4*370=1,480. Total 11,100 + 1,480 = 12,580. Then total is 222,000 + 12,580 = 234,580. Correct. Perfect. So that works. Similarly, denominator term for 16: 16^4 + 324. 16^4 is 65536. 65536 + 324 = 65860. Which is supposed to be 370*178. Let me compute 370*178. 300*178=53,400; 70*178=12,460. Total 53,400 + 12,460 = 65,860. Correct. So that works. So my factoring is correct.\n\nTherefore, the telescoping is valid, and the answer is 373. Let me check if 373 is a reasonable number. Since all the terms are positive and the cancellation leaves a single number. Also, 373 is a prime number? Maybe. Let me check 373 divided by small primes. 373 ÷ 2 no. 3? 3*124=372, so 373-372=1, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 3, no. 7? 7*53=371, 373-371=2, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*33=363, 363+11=374, too big. So 373 is prime. Seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the cancellation? Let me check again:\n\nOriginal numerator terms after factoring:\n\nEach numerator term factors into (x^2 + 6x + 18)(x^2 - 6x + 18). For x=10, 22, 34, 46, 58. Similarly denominator for x=4,16,28,40,52.\n\nNow, note that if we take x in numerator as 10, 22, 34, 46, 58, then x = 4 + 12k + 6? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the denominator x's are 4,16,28,40,52. Which is 4 + 12k for k=0,...,4. Similarly numerator x's are 10,22,... which is 10 + 12k. Note that 10 = 4 + 6. Similarly, 16 + 6 = 22. So the numerator x's are each 6 more than denominator x's. Let me check:\n\nIf I take denominator x as 4, then numerator x is 10 = 4 + 6. Similarly denominator x=16, numerator x=22=16+6, etc. So perhaps there is a relation between the factors.\n\nLet me think. Let me denote for denominator term with x, the factors are (x² + 6x + 18)(x² - 6x + 18). Wait, but if we take x in denominator, and look at numerator x = x_denominator + 6.\n\nLet me take x_denominator = y, then numerator x = y + 6. Let me compute the factors for numerator x = y + 6:\n\nNumerator factors: [(y+6)^2 + 6(y+6) + 18] and [(y+6)^2 - 6(y+6) + 18]\n\nCompute first factor:\n\n(y² + 12y + 36) + 6y + 36 + 18 = y² + 18y + 90? Wait:\n\nWait, let me do it step by step.\n\nFirst factor: (y + 6)^2 + 6(y + 6) + 18.\n\nExpanding (y + 6)^2: y² + 12y + 36.\n\nAdding 6(y + 6): 6y + 36. So total so far: y² + 12y + 36 + 6y + 36 = y² + 18y + 72.\n\nThen add 18: y² + 18y + 72 + 18 = y² + 18y + 90.\n\nSecond factor: (y + 6)^2 - 6(y + 6) + 18.\n\nExpanding (y + 6)^2: y² + 12y + 36.\n\nSubtract 6(y + 6): -6y - 36. Total so far: y² + 12y + 36 - 6y - 36 = y² + 6y.\n\nAdd 18: y² + 6y + 18.\n\nSo the numerator factors for x = y + 6 are (y² + 18y + 90)(y² + 6y + 18).\n\nCompare with denominator factors for x = y: (y² + 6y + 18)(y² - 6y + 18).\n\nTherefore, note that the second factor in the numerator (y² + 6y + 18) is the same as the first factor in the denominator (y² + 6y + 18). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms will cancel, leaving (y² + 18y + 90) / (y² - 6y + 18).\n\nSo for each pair of terms (numerator term over denominator term), we get [ (y² + 18y + 90) / (y² - 6y + 18) ].\n\nSo let's check with y=4 (denominator x=4, numerator x=10):\n\nNumerator factor over denominator factor: [ (4² + 18*4 + 90) / (4² - 6*4 + 18) ] = [ (16 + 72 + 90) / (16 - 24 + 18) ] = [ 178 / 10 ] which matches our previous calculation. Similarly for y=16:\n\n[ (16² + 18*16 + 90) / (16² - 6*16 + 18) ] = [ (256 + 288 + 90) / (256 - 96 + 18) ] = [ 634 / 178 ] which also matches.\n\nTherefore, each ratio of numerator term over denominator term is (y² + 18y + 90)/(y² - 6y + 18). Then, if we consider the entire product, it's the product over y=4,16,28,40,52 of [ (y² + 18y + 90)/(y² - 6y + 18) ].\n\nBut note that y² + 18y + 90 can be rewritten. Let me see:\n\ny² + 18y + 90. Let me check if this relates to the next term's denominator. Let me think recursively. Let me compute for the next term, if we take z = y + 12 (since the y's are increasing by 12 each time: 4,16,28,...). Let me check if y² + 18y + 90 equals (y + 12)^2 - 6(y + 12) + 18?\n\nLet me compute (y + 12)^2 - 6(y + 12) + 18:\n\n= y² + 24y + 144 - 6y - 72 + 18\n\n= y² + 18y + 144 - 72 + 18\n\n= y² + 18y + 90.\n\nYes! Exactly. Therefore, y² + 18y + 90 = (y + 12)^2 - 6(y + 12) + 18. Which is exactly the denominator term for y + 12. Therefore, each numerator part (y² + 18y + 90) is equal to the denominator part for y + 12. Therefore, when taking the product over y=4,16,28,40,52, each numerator part cancels with the denominator part of the next term. Let me write that:\n\nLet me denote the terms as follows:\n\nFor y_1 = 4: term1 = [ (y1² + 18y1 + 90) / (y1² - 6y1 + 18) ]\n\nSimilarly for y2 = 16: term2 = [ (y2² + 18y2 + 90) / (y2² - 6y2 + 18) ]\n\nBut y1² + 18y1 + 90 = (y1 + 12)^2 - 6(y1 + 12) + 18 = denominator part for y = y1 + 12 = y2.\n\nTherefore, term1 = [ denominator_part(y2) / denominator_part(y1) ]\n\nSimilarly term2 = [ denominator_part(y3) / denominator_part(y2) ] where y3 = y2 + 12 = 28.\n\nTherefore, multiplying term1 * term2 * term3 * term4 * term5:\n\n[ denominator_part(y2)/denominator_part(y1) ] * [ denominator_part(y3)/denominator_part(y2) ] * [ denominator_part(y4)/denominator_part(y3) ] * [ denominator_part(y5)/denominator_part(y4) ] * [ denominator_part(y6)/denominator_part(y5) ]\n\nWhich telescopes to denominator_part(y6)/denominator_part(y1).\n\nWhere y6 = y5 + 12. Since original y's are 4,16,28,40,52. Therefore, y5 = 52, so y6 = 52 + 12 = 64.\n\nTherefore, total product is denominator_part(64)/denominator_part(4).\n\nCompute denominator_part(y) is y² - 6y + 18. Therefore:\n\nTotal product is [64² - 6*64 + 18] / [4² - 6*4 + 18]\n\nCompute numerator: 64² is 4096. 6*64 is 384. So 4096 - 384 + 18 = 4096 - 384 is 3712; 3712 + 18 = 3730.\n\nDenominator: 4² - 6*4 + 18 = 16 - 24 + 18 = 10. Therefore, total product is 3730 / 10 = 373. Same as before. So this method also gives 373. Therefore, this confirms the answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 373. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 373.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{373}\n</think>"}
