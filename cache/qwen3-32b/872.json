The pulsar is modeled as a sphere with uniformly distributed mass. The given period is T = 5.19 milliseconds, which is 5.19 × 10^-3 seconds. The gravitational constant G is 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg². The options for density are from 10^4 to 10^18 kg/m³. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the pulsar is rotating, so there's a centrifugal force acting on the particles at its equator. For the pulsar to remain stable, the gravitational force must be strong enough to hold it together against this centrifugal force. So, the idea is that the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force to keep the matter from flying apart.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the centripetal force required for circular motion. The centripetal force F_c is given by F_c = m * ω² * R, where m is the mass of a particle, ω is the angular velocity, and R is the radius of the pulsar. The angular velocity ω is 2π divided by the period T, so ω = 2π / T.\n\nOn the other hand, the gravitational force F_g acting on a particle at the equator due to the rest of the pulsar is given by Newton's law of gravitation. For a spherical mass distribution, the gravitational force at the surface is F_g = G * M * m / R², where M is the total mass of the pulsar, and R is the radius.\n\nFor the pulsar to be stable, the gravitational force must be at least equal to the centrifugal force. So setting F_g = F_c:\n\nG * M * m / R² = m * (4π² / T²) * R\n\nSimplifying this, the mass m cancels out:\n\nG * M / R² = 4π² R / T²\n\nThen rearranging for M:\n\nM / R³ = 4π² / (G T²)\n\nBut the density ρ is mass divided by volume, so ρ = M / ( (4/3)πR³ ). Therefore, M / R³ = (4π/3) ρ.\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation:\n\n(4π/3) ρ = 4π² / (G T²)\n\nDivide both sides by 4π:\n\n(1/3) ρ = π / (G T²)\n\nThen solving for ρ:\n\nρ = 3π / (G T²)\n\nSo the density is given by this formula. Let me check if this makes sense. If the period is shorter (faster rotation), the required density is higher, which makes sense because the centrifugal force is stronger. The formula doesn't depend on the radius or mass directly because we assumed the pulsar is just on the verge of breaking apart, so the minimum density would be when the gravitational force is just enough to provide the necessary centripetal force. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nG = 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg²\n\nT = 5.19 × 10^-3 seconds\n\nCompute T² first: (5.19 × 10^-3)^2 ≈ (5.19)^2 × 10^-6 ≈ 26.94 × 10^-6 ≈ 2.694 × 10^-5 s²\n\nThen compute denominator: G*T² ≈ 6.67 × 10^-11 * 2.694 × 10^-5 ≈ Let me calculate that:\n\nFirst multiply 6.67 × 2.694 ≈ 6.67 * 2.694 ≈ Let me compute 6 * 2.694 = 16.164, 0.67*2.694 ≈ 1.805, total ≈ 16.164 + 1.805 ≈ 17.969. So approximately 18 × 10^-11-5 = 18 × 10^-16? Wait, 6.67 × 10^-11 multiplied by 2.694 × 10^-5 is 6.67 * 2.694 × 10^(-11-5) = approx 17.97 × 10^-16 ≈ 1.8 × 10^-15.\n\nWait, 6.67 × 2.694 ≈ let me do more accurately:\n\n6.67 × 2.694:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n2.694 × 6 = 16.164\n\n2.694 × 0.67 = ?\n\nWell, 2.694 × 0.6 = 1.6164, 2.694 × 0.07 = 0.18858. Total ≈ 1.6164 + 0.18858 ≈ 1.80498.\n\nTotal is 16.164 + 1.80498 ≈ 17.96898 ≈ 17.97. So 17.97 × 10^-16 ≈ 1.797 × 10^-15. So approximately 1.8 × 10^-15 N·m²/kg²·s²? Wait, the units might not matter here as we are just calculating the numerical value.\n\nThen 3π divided by that value.\n\n3π ≈ 9.4248.\n\nSo ρ ≈ 9.4248 / (1.8 × 10^-15) ≈ 5.236 × 10^15 kg/m³.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5 × 10^15 kg/m³. So that seems to be the answer. But let me check my calculations again for errors.\n\nFirst, T is 5.19 ms = 5.19 × 10^-3 s. Squared is (5.19)^2 × 10^-6. 5.19 squared: 5^2=25, 0.19^2=0.0361, cross term 2*5*0.19=1.9. So (5 + 0.19)^2 = 25 + 1.9 + 0.0361 ≈ 26.9361. So 26.9361 × 10^-6 s² ≈ 2.6936 × 10^-5 s². Correct.\n\nG*T² = 6.67e-11 * 2.6936e-5 ≈ Let me compute 6.67 * 2.6936 ≈ 6.67 * 2.69 ≈ Let me use calculator steps:\n\n6.67 × 2.6936:\n\nFirst, 6 × 2.6936 = 16.1616\n\n0.67 × 2.6936 = ?\n\nWell, 0.6 × 2.6936 = 1.61616\n\n0.07 × 2.6936 ≈ 0.18855\n\nAdding those gives 1.61616 + 0.18855 ≈ 1.80471\n\nTotal is 16.1616 + 1.80471 ≈ 17.9663. So 17.9663 × 10^-16 ≈ 1.7966 × 10^-15. Correct.\n\nThen 3π ≈ 9.4248 divided by 1.7966 × 10^-15 ≈ 9.4248 / 1.7966 ≈ 5.246 × 10^15 kg/m³. So approximately 5.2 × 10^15 kg/m³. Which is option C: 5 × 10^15 kg/m³. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Let me check if there was any mistake in the derivation.\n\nThe key equation was ρ = 3π/(G T²). Is that correct?\n\nStarting from equating gravitational force to centripetal force:\n\nG M m / R² = m (4π² / T²) R\n\nCancel m:\n\nG M / R² = 4 π² R / T²\n\nMultiply both sides by R²:\n\nG M = 4 π² R³ / T²\n\nThen divide both sides by G:\n\nM = (4 π² / (G T²)) R³\n\nThen density ρ = M / ( (4/3) π R³ ) = (4 π² / (G T²) R³ ) / (4/3 π R³ ) ) = (4 π² / (G T² )) * (3 / (4 π)) ) = 3 π / (G T² )\n\nYes, correct. So the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is C.\n</think>"}
