So, we have two gases, A and B, which are binary compounds made up of three elements. Two of these elements are in adjacent groups of the periodic table. Both gases can burn in air. Their density relative to argon is about 0.5, with a 2% error. Gas A dissolves well in water, making a solution with pH >7, while B is almost insoluble in water. We need to write the combustion equations for A and B and find the sum of the molecular masses of their products.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the density of a gas relative to another is proportional to their molar masses. Argon has a molar mass of about 40 g/mol. If the density ratio is 0.5, then the molar masses of A and B should be roughly half of argon's, so around 20 g/mol. Considering a 2% error, their molar masses could be between 19.2 and 20.8 g/mol.\n\nNow, since they are binary compounds consisting of three elements, that might be a bit confusing. Wait, \"binary compounds\" usually mean composed of two elements, but the problem says they consist of three elements. Hmm. Maybe there's a typo, or perhaps the term is being used differently here. Wait, maybe it's a translation issue. Let me think. If it's a binary compound, maybe it's two elements, but the problem says three elements. Maybe the problem is that the gases are binary (two elements each), but the three elements are shared between the two compounds? Or perhaps each gas is a binary compound (two elements) and the three elements in total are two adjacent groups plus another element. Maybe I need to figure out the elements involved.\n\nGiven that both gases can burn in air. Combustion reactions usually involve reactions with oxygen. So, if they are combustible, they might be hydrocarbons or contain elements that can react with oxygen. Also, gas A dissolves in water to give a basic solution. That suggests that when A dissolves in water, it produces a base. Common gases that do this are ammonia (NH3), which dissolves to form NH4OH, a weak base. Alternatively, maybe something like a metal hydride, but those are usually not gases. Ammonia is a gas, though.\n\nGas B is insoluble in water. Maybe something like carbon dioxide? Wait, but CO2 is a bit soluble. Or maybe a hydrocarbon? If B is a hydrocarbon, then combustion would produce CO2 and H2O. But hydrocarbons are usually not very soluble in water.\n\nLet me start by considering possible gases with molar masses around 20 g/mol.\n\nFor gas A, which gives a basic solution. If it's NH3, molar mass is 14+3(1) = 17 g/mol. Close to 20 but a bit lower. But with a 2% error, maybe 17 is within 19.2-20.8? 17 is 17/20 = 0.85, so no. Wait, the density ratio is 0.5 relative to argon. So the molar mass is 0.5 * 40 = 20 g/mol. So the gas has molar mass ~20. NH3 is 17, so maybe another compound.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe a gas like PH3? Phosphine. Molar mass is 31 g/mol. That's too high. How about CH3NH2? Methylamine? Molar mass is 31.06. Still too high. Maybe something else. Wait, maybe the compound is not a simple one. Wait, the problem says they are binary compounds consisting of three elements. Wait, that's confusing. Binary compounds are made of two elements. So if each gas is a binary compound (two elements), but together, the two gases involve three elements. For example, if one gas is a compound of elements from group X and Y, and the other gas is a compound of elements from group Y and Z, but two of the elements are in adjacent groups. So maybe elements from group 15 and 16, or 16 and 17, etc.\n\nLet me think again. The two elements in adjacent groups. For example, nitrogen (group 15) and oxygen (group 16) are adjacent. Or oxygen (group 16) and fluorine (group 17). Or maybe sulfur and chlorine. Alternatively, carbon (group 14) and nitrogen (group 15). Or maybe hydrogen is involved? Hydrogen can be in group 1, but adjacent to group 2. But hydrogen is in group 1, so adjacent to group 2. But if the compounds are binary, maybe they are hydrides.\n\nIf gas A is a hydride that gives a basic solution, like NH3. But molar mass is 17. Maybe another hydride? Let me check. For example, PH3 is 34 g/mol, too high. NH3 is 17. Maybe if the gas is something else. Wait, maybe the gas is not a hydride but another compound. Wait, but combustion in air... If it's a hydride, then combustion would involve reaction with oxygen.\n\nWait, another thought: if the molar mass is around 20, and it's a binary compound, maybe it's something like CH4 (methane) which is 16 g/mol. Still a bit low. C2H6 is 30 g/mol. Maybe not. Wait, maybe it's a compound containing oxygen? For example, CO? Carbon monoxide is 28 g/mol. Still higher. Or maybe H2O? But that's a liquid. Not a gas under normal conditions. How about NO? Nitrogen monoxide, molar mass 30. Still too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is a binary compound with hydrogen and another element. Let me think. If the molar mass is around 20, then for a binary compound of H and X, the molar mass would be 1 + X. So X would be around 19 g/mol. The element with molar mass around 19 is fluorine (19.00 g/mol). So HF would be 20.01 g/mol. Exactly 20.01. That's perfect! So HF has molar mass 20.01 g/mol. But HF is a gas? At standard temperature and pressure, HF is a liquid, but it can be a gas at higher temperatures. However, HF is a gas at room temperature under certain pressures. But the problem says it's a gas. Also, HF dissolves in water to form hydrofluoric acid, which is acidic. But the problem states that gas A dissolves to form a solution with pH>7 (basic). So HF is not it. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think again. If the compound is binary (two elements) and has molar mass ~20. Let's think of other elements. Let's consider elements in adjacent groups. For example, nitrogen (group 15) and oxygen (group 16). A binary compound of N and O. The possible ones are NO, NO2, N2O, etc. Let's check their molar masses:\n\n- NO: 14 + 16 = 30 g/mol\n- NO2: 14 + 32 = 46\n- N2O: 28 + 16 = 44\nToo high. What about something with hydrogen?\n\nIf the elements are in adjacent groups, maybe group 14 and 15. For example, carbon and nitrogen. Binary compounds could be cyanides, but as gases? Like HCN? Hydrogen cyanide. Molar mass is 27 g/mol. Still higher than 20. Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the elements are in groups 15 and 16. Let me think. For example, phosphorus and sulfur. Binary compounds like P4S10, but those are not gases. Maybe PH3 (phosphine) is 34 g/mol. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the elements are in groups 1 and 2? Hydrogen and helium? No. Hydrogen and lithium? But lithium hydride is a solid. Not a gas.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is something like NH3. Let me check the molar mass again. NH3 is 14 + 3(1) = 17. Close to 20. If the density is measured with some error, maybe 17 is within the 2% error of 20? Let's check. The actual molar mass of A is 17. The expected is 20. The ratio is 17/20 = 0.85. The problem states the density ratio is ~0.5, so 0.5 ± 0.02 (2%). So 0.48 to 0.52. If the actual density ratio is 0.5, then the molar mass is 0.5*40=20. If the gas has molar mass 17, then the density ratio would be 17/40 = 0.425, which is 0.425, which is lower than 0.48. So that's outside the 2% error. Therefore, NH3 is not acceptable.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think of other binary compounds with molar masses around 20. Let me list some:\n\n- CH4: 16.04\n- NH3: 17.03\n- H2S: 34.08\n- PH3: 33.99\n- HCl: 36.46\n- CO: 28.01\n- N2O: 44.01\n- C2H4: 28.05\n- C2H6: 30.07\n- O2: 32.00\n- N2: 28.02\n- H2O: 18.02 (but it's a liquid)\n- HF: 20.01\n\nAh, HF is 20.01. So that's very close. But as mentioned, HF is a gas at standard pressure? At room temperature, HF is a liquid, but it has a boiling point of 19.5°C, so just below room temperature. So at slightly elevated temperatures, it's a gas. Maybe the problem is considering it as a gas. However, HF dissolves in water to form a strong acid (hydrofluoric acid), which is pH <7, but the problem states that gas A dissolves to form pH>7. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe there's another compound. Let me think again. If the molar mass is around 20, and the compound is a binary compound consisting of three elements... Wait, that might be a translation error. Maybe the problem says that the gases are binary compounds consisting of two elements, and the three elements in total are from adjacent groups. So for example, gas A has elements X and Y, gas B has elements Y and Z, and X and Y are in adjacent groups, or Y and Z are in adjacent groups. So the three elements are from adjacent groups.\n\nLet me try to think of another possibility. If the gas A is something like NH3 (molar mass 17), but maybe the actual molar mass is higher. Let me think about possible errors. The problem says the density relative to argon is ~0.5 with 2% error. So the molar mass could be 0.5*40*(1±0.02) = 20*(0.98 to 1.02) = 19.6 to 20.4 g/mol. So the molar mass of the gas should be between 19.6 and 20.4 g/mol. So HF is exactly 20.01, which is within that range. But as mentioned, HF is acidic. So maybe there's another compound?\n\nWait, maybe the gas is not a binary compound but a ternary one? The problem says \"binary compounds consisting of three elements\". Wait, that doesn't make sense. A binary compound is made of two elements. If they consist of three elements, then they are ternary compounds. So maybe there's a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem means that the gases are binary compounds (two elements each), and the three elements involved are from adjacent groups. For example, gas A has elements from groups X and Y, gas B has elements from groups Y and Z, where X and Y are adjacent, and Y and Z are adjacent. So total three elements.\n\nLet me think of possible elements. Let's suppose that the elements are in groups 15 and 16. For example, nitrogen and oxygen. A binary compound of N and O. But their molar masses are too high. Alternatively, maybe the elements are in groups 14 and 15, like carbon and nitrogen. But again, molar masses of their compounds are too high. Wait, maybe the elements are in groups 1 and 2? Hydrogen and helium? No. Hydrogen and lithium? But LiH is a solid.\n\nWait, maybe the elements are in groups 16 and 17. For example, oxygen and fluorine. A binary compound would be OF2, which is a gas. Let's check its molar mass: 16 + 2*19 = 16 + 38 = 54 g/mol. Too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are in groups 15 and 16, like phosphorus and sulfur. Binary compounds like P4S10 are not gases. How about PH3 and H2S? But again, molar masses are too high.\n\nWait, maybe the elements are in groups 14 and 15. For example, carbon and nitrogen. A binary compound like C3N4? Not a gas. Or HCN? As mentioned earlier, molar mass 27. No.\n\nWait, maybe the elements are in groups 13 and 14. Like boron and carbon. Binary compounds like B4C? Not a gas. Or maybe BH3? But BH3 is a gas? No, BH3 is a highly reactive gas but dimerizes to B2H6 (diborane), which is a gas. Let's check molar mass of B2H6: 2*10.81 + 6*1 = 21.62 + 6 = 27.62 g/mol. Still higher than 20.4.\n\nHmm. Maybe the elements are in groups 1 and 17? Hydrogen and fluorine. HF, which we discussed earlier. Molar mass 20.01, which fits. But HF is acidic. However, maybe there's another compound? Wait, maybe the gas is a different compound. Let me think again. What if the gas is not a hydride? For example, a binary compound of oxygen and another element. Let's say oxygen and fluorine? OF2 is a gas, but molar mass is 54. No. What about O2? But that's not a binary compound with another element. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element, but not a hydride. Wait, but all binary compounds with hydrogen are hydrides. So maybe the other element is in a different group. For example, hydrogen and another element from group 16. H2S is 34 g/mol. No. How about H2O? Not a gas. Or maybe H2Se? Even higher.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound with hydrogen and an element from group 15. Like NH3 (17), PH3 (34). No. But NH3 is 17, which is below the 19.6 cutoff. Maybe the problem allows for some error? If the actual molar mass is 17, but the measured density gives 20, which is 2% error? Wait, the density ratio is mass ratio. The density ratio is equal to the molar mass ratio if pressure and temperature are the same. So if the gas has molar mass M, and argon is 40, then density ratio is M/40. The problem says this ratio is 0.5 ± 2%, so M is 20 ± 0.4 (since 2% of 20 is 0.4). So M should be between 19.6 and 20.4. NH3 is 17, which is outside. So not acceptable. HF is 20.01, which is within range. But HF is acidic.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a different compound. Let me think. If the compound is a binary compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, but with different stoichiometry. For example, N2H4 (hydrazine)? Molar mass is 32.05. No. Or NH2? Not stable. Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of carbon and hydrogen. Let's see. CH4 is 16.04. C2H6 is 30.07. C2H4 is 28.05. C3H8 is 44.1. None of these are in the 19.6-20.4 range. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of oxygen and hydrogen. H2O is 18.02, but it's a liquid. H2O2? Peroxide. Molar mass 34.01. No. Not in the range.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me go back to HF. Even though it's acidic, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's description? Or maybe there's another interpretation. The problem says that gas A dissolves in water to give pH>7. If the gas is basic, maybe it's a different compound. Let me think of other gases that are basic and have molar masses around 20. Ammonia is the main one, but it's molar mass is too low. Maybe if the gas is a mixture or something? No, the problem says it's a binary compound. Wait, maybe the gas is not a hydride but an oxide? For example, NO2 is acidic. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is something like NH2OH (hydroxylamine)? But that's a ternary compound (N, H, O), and it's not a gas. Or maybe another compound. Wait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of nitrogen and oxygen that somehow forms a basic solution. But I can't think of any. NO2 is acidic, NO is neutral. N2O is neutral. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the gas itself being basic, but the solution formed when it dissolves. For example, if the gas is a base. Ammonia dissolves in water to form NH4OH. But if the gas is HF, it forms a strong acid. So maybe there's another possibility. Wait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of a metal and another element, but metals usually form solids. Not gases.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element, but with a higher molar mass? For example, if the gas is something like CH3NH2 (methylamine), which is a gas. Molar mass is 31.06. No. Or maybe something else. Wait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of two elements where one is not hydrogen. Let me think again. For example, a binary compound of oxygen and another element. If the gas is O2, but that's not a binary compound with another element. Wait, maybe a binary compound of oxygen and fluorine? OF2, but it's molar mass is too high.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows for the molar mass to be slightly outside the 19.6-20.4 range due to the 2% error in the density measurement. Let me check. If the gas has a molar mass of 17 (like NH3), then the density ratio would be 17/40 = 0.425, which is 0.425/0.5 = 0.85, so a 15% error. That's way outside the 2% error. So not acceptable. If the gas is HF with molar mass 20.01, then the density ratio is 20.01/40 = 0.50025, which is 0.50025/0.5 = 1.0005, which is within the 2% error. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut HF is acidic. However, the problem says gas A dissolves to give pH>7. So this seems conflicting. Unless there's a mistake in my assumption. Maybe the gas is not HF but another compound. Let me think again. Maybe the gas is a binary compound of another element. Let me consider elements with lower atomic masses. For example, boron and hydrogen. B2H6 (diborane) has a molar mass of 27.67 g/mol. Still too high. Or maybe BH3? But it dimerizes.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of carbon and hydrogen, but with a different ratio. For example, CH2? But that's not stable. Or maybe something like C2H2 (acetylene) which is 26.04 g/mol. Still too high.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element, but the other element is in a different group. For example, hydrogen and helium. But He is a noble gas and doesn't form compounds. Hydrogen and lithium? LiH is a solid. Not a gas. Hydrogen and beryllium? BeH2 is a solid. Hydrogen and boron? B2H6 is a gas but molar mass is 27.67. No.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering a gas with a molar mass slightly above 20. For example, if the gas is something like N2H4 (hydrazine) which is 32.05. No. Or maybe NH2OH, but that's ternary.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of nitrogen and hydrogen but with a different formula. Let me calculate. Suppose the gas is NH2. Molar mass would be 14 + 2(1) = 16. Still too low. Or N2H2? 28 + 2 = 30. Still too high. No.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me try to think of another approach. Since both gases can burn in air, their combustion reactions would involve reaction with oxygen to produce oxides. For gas A, which gives a basic solution, maybe the combustion produces an oxide that reacts with water to form a base. For example, if the gas is NH3, combustion would produce N2 and H2O. But NH3 combustion: 4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O. The products are nitrogen gas and water. Water is neutral, but if there's excess NH3, maybe the solution is basic? But the problem says that gas A dissolves in water to give pH>7. If the gas is NH3, then when it dissolves in water, it forms NH4OH, which is basic. But earlier molar mass issue remains.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows for the molar mass to be slightly off due to the 2% error. If the gas is NH3 with molar mass 17, then the density ratio is 0.425, which is 0.425/0.5 = 0.85, which is a 15% error. That's too much. So not acceptable. But if there's a mistake in the problem and the gas is NH3, then maybe proceed. But I need to find a compound with molar mass around 20 that is a binary compound, combustible, and when dissolved in water gives a basic solution.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the gas is a binary compound containing oxygen. For example, if it's a peroxide or something. But I can't think of any gaseous peroxides. Maybe ozone? O3 is a gas, but it's a triatomic molecule of oxygen, not a binary compound with another element.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of oxygen and another element that forms a basic oxide. For example, if the gas is something like CO (carbon monoxide), but CO is neutral. If it's something like NO, but that's acidic. No.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of a metal and oxygen, but metals don't form gaseous compounds.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element that forms a basic oxide. For example, if the gas is something like NH3, but as discussed, molar mass is too low. Maybe if the gas is a different hydride. Wait, maybe the problem is not about the gas itself but about the combustion products. Let me think about combustion reactions.\n\nFor gas A, which is basic when dissolved in water. If it's a hydrocarbon, combustion would produce CO2 and H2O. But CO2 is acidic. But the problem says gas A is basic. So maybe it's not a hydrocarbon. Maybe it's a compound containing nitrogen, like NH3. Combustion of NH3 produces N2 and H2O. If the gas is NH3, then combustion equation is 4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O. The products are N2 and H2O. If the gas is dissolved in water to form NH4OH, which is basic. So maybe the problem is okay with NH3 even though its molar mass is 17. Maybe the 2% error allows for it? Let me check the exact numbers.\n\nIf the molar mass of the gas is 17 g/mol, then the density ratio to argon is 17/40 = 0.425. The problem states the density ratio is ~0.5 with error no more than 2%. The allowed range for density ratio is 0.5*(1±0.02) = 0.49 to 0.51. Wait, no, if the actual density ratio is 0.5 ± 2%, then the range is 0.5*0.98 to 0.5*1.02, which is 0.49 to 0.51. But 0.425 is way below that. So NH3 is out. Therefore, I must find another compound.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound with a molar mass of exactly 20. Let's think of elements with atomic masses adding up to 20. Let's consider elements from adjacent groups.\n\nFor example, if the elements are in groups 14 and 15 (carbon and nitrogen), a binary compound could be CN^- (cyanide ion), but as a gas? Not sure. Or maybe C3N4, but it's not a gas.\n\nWait, if the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element, let's think. H has atomic mass 1. So the other element would need to have atomic mass around 19. Fluorine is 19. So HF. But HF is acidic. What about if the gas is a binary compound of deuterium (heavy hydrogen)? But the problem doesn't mention isotopes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is a binary compound of another element. For example, if the elements are in groups 15 and 16, like nitrogen and oxygen. But their compounds have higher molar masses.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of oxygen and another element from group 17. For example, ClO? But ClO is a radical, not a stable gas. Or maybe Cl2O? Molar mass is 86.9 g/mol. No.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of sulfur and fluorine. SF6 is a gas, but molar mass is 146.06. No.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think again about the HF possibility. If the gas is HF, which is a gas at slightly above its boiling point, and the problem allows for that, then even though it's acidic, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's description, or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a different compound. Wait, what about if the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element from group 14? Like CH4 (methane), which is 16 g/mol. Still too low. Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of two elements where one is not hydrogen. For example, if the elements are in groups 15 and 16, like nitrogen and oxygen. A binary compound like NO, which is 30 g/mol. Too high. Or maybe a different ratio. Like N2O3? Molar mass is 76.01. No.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element from group 16, but with a different ratio. For example, H2S is 34.08. No. H2O is 18.02. Still not in the range.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of two elements from group 14 and 15, but with a molar mass around 20. For example, if it's BH3, but boron is group 13. Not adjacent.\n\nWait, maybe the elements are in groups 1 and 2. For example, hydrogen and helium. But helium doesn't form compounds.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element from group 17, like HCl. Molar mass is 36.46. Too high.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of two elements where one is hydrogen and the other is a lighter element. For example, if the element is lithium (group 1), then LiH is a solid. Not a gas. Beryllium hydride is also a solid.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consider that the gas is HF despite it being acidic. Perhaps the problem has an error, or maybe I'm missing a key point. Let's proceed with HF as gas A, even though it's acidic, and see if it fits other parts of the problem.\n\nIf gas A is HF, then combustion reaction would be with oxygen. But what does HF combust to? Fluorine is highly electronegative, so HF is stable and doesn't combust. Wait, that's a problem. The problem says both gases can be burned in air. So if gas A is HF, it shouldn't burn, which contradicts the problem statement. So HF is out.\n\nAh! This is a key point. The problem states that both gases can be burned in air. So the gas must be combustible. So if the gas is HF, it cannot burn, because it's already a stable compound. So HF is out. Therefore, my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nSo what other gases are combustible, have molar mass around 20, are binary compounds, and one dissolves to give a basic solution?\n\nLet me think again. Combustible gases include hydrocarbons, hydrogen, ammonia, etc.\n\nHydrogen is H2, molar mass 2.02. Too low. Ammonia, as discussed, molar mass 17. Hydrocarbons: CH4 (16), C2H6 (30), etc. So CH4 is 16, which is below the required 19.6. C2H6 is 30, which is above 20.4. So none of the simple hydrocarbons fit. Maybe a different type of compound.\n\nWhat about hydrogen sulfide, H2S? Molar mass 34.08. Too high. Phosphine, PH3: 33.99. No. Ammonia: 17. No. Let me think about other compounds. What about silane, SiH4? Molar mass is 32.12. No. Methanol is a liquid. Not a gas.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of carbon and oxygen, like CO? Molar mass 28.01. Too high. Combustion of CO would be CO + 1/2 O2 → CO2. But CO is a gas that can burn. But if gas A is CO, then dissolving in water would form carbonic acid, which is weakly acidic. But the problem says gas A dissolves to form pH>7. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, like NH3. Even though its molar mass is 17, let's see. If it can be burned, then the combustion equation is 4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O. This reaction is possible, though it requires a catalyst or high temperature. If the problem allows for that, then maybe proceed. But the molar mass issue remains. Let me check the density again. If the actual molar mass is 17, and the measured density gives 20, that's a 15% error, which is way outside the 2% allowed. So this is not acceptable.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element, but the other element is a lighter isotope? Unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the problem's mention of three elements is a red herring, and it's actually referring to the gases being composed of two elements each, and the three elements in total are from adjacent groups. For example, gas A is a compound of elements X and Y, gas B is a compound of Y and Z, where X and Y are in adjacent groups, and Y and Z are in adjacent groups. So total three elements.\n\nLet me think of possible elements. Let's say Y is oxygen (group 16), X is nitrogen (group 15), and Z is fluorine (group 17). So gas A could be NOx, and gas B could be OF2. But their molar masses are too high.\n\nAlternatively, let's say Y is nitrogen (group 15), X is carbon (group 14), and Z is oxygen (group 16). Gas A could be a cyanide like HCN (but it's a ternary compound), or a binary compound like C3N4. Not a gas.\n\nWait, maybe gas A is a binary compound of carbon and hydrogen (a hydrocarbon), and gas B is a binary compound of carbon and oxygen. Let's say gas A is CH4 (molar mass 16), gas B is CO (28). But neither fits the molar mass range.\n\nAlternatively, gas A is a binary compound of hydrogen and nitrogen (NH3, 17), and gas B is a binary compound of nitrogen and oxygen (NO, 30). Still, molar masses are out of range.\n\nWait, maybe the three elements are in groups 14, 15, and 16. For example, gas A is a compound of group 14 and 15, and gas B is a compound of group 15 and 16. Let's say gas A is a compound like CH3NH2 (but it's ternary), or maybe something else. No, it has to be binary.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider that the molar mass is around 20, and the gas is combustible. Let's list all possible combustible gases with molar masses around 20.\n\n- Methane (CH4): 16.04\n- Ammonia (NH3): 17.03\n- Ethane (C2H6): 30.07\n- Ethylene (C2H4): 28.05\n- Acetylene (C2H2): 26.04\n- Propane (C3H8): 44.10\n- Butane (C4H10): 58.12\n- Hydrogen sulfide (H2S): 34.08\n- Phosphine (PH3): 33.99\n- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN): 27.03\n- Carbon monoxide (CO): 28.01\n- Nitric oxide (NO): 30.01\n- Nitrous oxide (N2O): 44.01\n- Dinitrogen monoxide (N2O): same as above\n- Diborane (B2H6): 27.67\n- Sulfur dioxide (SO2): 64.07\n- Sulfur trioxide (SO3): 80.06\n- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 44.01\n- Nitrogen dioxide (NO2): 46.01\n- Ozone (O3): 48.00\n- Hydrogen fluoride (HF): 20.01\n- Hydrogen chloride (HCl): 36.46\n- Hydrogen bromide (HBr): 80.91\n- Hydrogen iodide (HI): 127.91\n\nFrom this list, the only ones with molar masses in the 19.6-20.4 range are HF (20.01). But HF is acidic and doesn't burn. Wait, but maybe it can burn? Let me check. HF is a very stable compound and doesn't combust. So that's out.\n\nWait, what about if the gas is a mixture of two gases? No, the problem says they are binary compounds, so pure compounds.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me revisit the problem statement.\n\n\"Both gases can be burned in the air. The density of each of the gases relative to the density of argon at the same pressure and at the same temperature is equal to ~0.50 (error no more than 2%).\"\n\nSo the density ratio is 0.5, so molar mass is 20 g/mol. Gas A dissolves in water to give pH>7. Gas B is almost insoluble.\n\nIf there's no gas fitting these criteria, maybe the problem is referring to a different approach. Let me think about the combustion products.\n\nIf gas A is something like NH3, even with molar mass 17, and the problem allows for some error, then its combustion produces N2 and H2O. The solution of NH3 in water is basic. Maybe the problem is okay with that, even if the molar mass is slightly off.\n\nSimilarly, for gas B, which is insoluble in water. If it's a hydrocarbon like ethylene (C2H4, molar mass 28.05), which is slightly above the desired range. But if we assume that the problem allows for some flexibility, maybe it's a different compound.\n\nWait, maybe the gases are not simple molecules but have different stoichiometry. For example, if the gas is something like N2H4 (hydrazine), molar mass 32.05. No. Or maybe a different compound.\n\nWait, let me think about the three elements being in adjacent groups. Let's say two of the elements are in adjacent groups, and the third is another element. For example, if gas A is NH3 (N and H), and gas B is something like NO (N and O). Here, N is in group 15, O in group 16 (adjacent), and H in group 1. But the three elements would be N, H, O. Two of which are in adjacent groups (N and O).\n\nIf gas A is NH3 (molar mass 17), and gas B is NO (molar mass 30), then their densities relative to argon would be 17/40 = 0.425 and 30/40 = 0.75, which are both outside the 0.5 ± 2% range. So no.\n\nWait, what if gas A is something like CH3NH2 (methylamine), which is a gas. Molar mass is 31.06. Still too high.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element, but the other element is a lighter isotope. For example, deuterium. D2 would have molar mass 4, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is a binary compound of a lighter element. For example, if the gas is something like BH3, but it's unstable. B2H6 is 27.67 g/mol. Still too high.\n\nWait, let me think about the possibility that the gas is a binary compound of two elements, one of which is oxygen, and the other is a light element. For example, if the gas is something like H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), but it's a liquid. Or O3, but it's a single element. No.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of oxygen and another element, but in a different ratio. For example, O2 is a gas but it's a single element. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and not finding a suitable compound, maybe I need to proceed with the assumption that gas A is NH3, even though its molar mass is out of range, and gas B is something like C2H4 (ethylene), which has a molar mass of 28.05 g/mol, which is outside the 19.6-20.4 range, but maybe the problem has some flexibility.\n\nLet's try this approach.\n\nGas A: NH3 (ammonia). Combustion reaction: 4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O. This produces nitrogen gas and water. When dissolved in water, it forms NH4OH, which is basic.\n\nGas B: Let's assume it's a hydrocarbon. Since it's insoluble in water, maybe something like ethylene (C2H4). Combustion reaction: C2H4 + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O. Products are CO2 and H2O.\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the molecular masses of the products, taking into account stoichiometric coefficients as whole numbers.\n\nFor equation 1 (combustion of NH3): products are 2 moles of N2 (molar mass 28 g/mol) and 6 moles of H2O (molar mass 18 g/mol). Total molecular mass would be (2*28) + (6*18) = 56 + 108 = 164 g/mol.\n\nFor equation 2 (combustion of C2H4): products are 2 moles of CO2 (44 g/mol) and 2 moles of H2O (18 g/mol). Total molecular mass is (2*44) + (2*18) = 88 + 36 = 124 g/mol.\n\nSum of the molecular masses of products from both reactions: 164 + 124 = 288. This is outside the given options (A:260-280, B:170-190, C:130-150, D:230-250). So this doesn't match any options. Therefore, this assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe gas B is a different compound. Let's say it's a hydrocarbon with molar mass around 20. But no such hydrocarbon exists. If it's a binary compound of carbon and hydrogen, like CH4 (16), but it's below the range. If it's C2H2 (acetylene, 26.04), which is slightly above the range. Let's try that.\n\nCombustion of C2H2: 2C2H2 + 5O2 → 4CO2 + 2H2O. Products: 4CO2 and 2H2O. Molecular masses: 4*44 + 2*18 = 176 + 36 = 212. Adding to the previous 164 from NH3 gives 376, which is even higher.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumptions are incorrect. Let me try another approach.\n\nMaybe the gases are not hydrocarbons or ammonia, but other compounds. Let's think about the three elements being in adjacent groups. For example, if two elements are in group 15 and 16, and the third is another element. Let's say gas A is PH3 (phosphine, molar mass 34), which is too high, but maybe the problem allows for some error. Combustion of PH3: PH3 + 2O2 → H3PO4 (but this is a liquid). Not sure. Alternatively, PH3 + O2 → P2O5 + H2O. This is complex. PH3 is combustible, forming P2O5 and H2O. But the molar mass is too high.\n\nGas B could be something like H2S (molar mass 34), but again too high. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the gases are not simple compounds. Let me think about the possibility of the gases being binary compounds of hydrogen and another element, where the other element is in group 15 or 16, but with a lower molar mass.\n\nWait, if the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element with molar mass around 19, like fluorine, giving HF. Even though it's acidic, let's proceed and see what happens.\n\nCombustion of HF: HF is already a stable compound and doesn't burn. So this is invalid.\n\nWait, what if the gas is a binary compound of oxygen and another element, but it can burn. For example, if the gas is a reducing agent. Let's think about CO. Combustion of CO: 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. CO has molar mass 28, which is too high. But if we proceed, the products are CO2. If gas A is something else.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the problem is referring to different elements. Let me think about elements in groups 1 and 2. For example, hydrogen (group 1) and helium (group 2). But helium doesn't form compounds.\n\nWait, maybe the elements are in groups 17 and 18. No, noble gases don't form compounds easily.\n\nWait, let me think about the possibility that the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element, and the other element is in group 14. For example, CH4 (methane). Molar mass 16. Combustion: CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O. If gas A is CH4, but it's molar mass is too low. However, if gas A is CH4 and gas B is something else, let's see.\n\nBut the problem says both gases have molar masses around 20. So this is not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the gases are not pure substances but have some impurities, but the problem states they are binary compounds.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to proceed with the assumption that gas A is NH3 (even with molar mass 17) and gas B is a hydrocarbon with molar mass around 20, even though no such hydrocarbon exists, and see if the sum of molecular masses of products fits one of the options.\n\nBut since this approach didn't work earlier, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that the three elements are in adjacent groups, and the gases are binary compounds. Let's say the elements are nitrogen (group 15), oxygen (group 16), and hydrogen (group 1). Gas A could be NH3 (N and H), gas B could be NO (N and O). Even though their molar masses are out of range, let's proceed.\n\nCombustion of NH3: 4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O. Products: 2N2 (2*28=56) + 6H2O (6*18=108) = 164.\n\nCombustion of NO: 2NO + O2 → 2NO2. Products: 2NO2 (2*46=92). Sum: 164 + 92 = 256. This falls into option A (260-280) if we round up, but it's 256, which is close to option D (230-250). Not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, if gas B is combusted to produce CO2 and H2O, but with a different stoichiometry.\n\nWait, maybe gas B is a different compound. Let's say it's something like C2H2 (acetylene, molar mass 26.04). Combustion: 2C2H2 + 5O2 → 4CO2 + 2H2O. Products: 4CO2 (4*44=176) + 2H2O (2*18=36) = 212. Total sum with NH3: 164 + 212 = 376. No.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the gases are not ammonia and a hydrocarbon, but something else. Let me think about the possibility that gas A is a binary compound of oxygen and another element, and gas B is a binary compound of another element and oxygen.\n\nWait, if gas A is a binary compound that gives a basic solution, maybe it's a metal oxide, but metals don't form gaseous compounds.\n\nWait, another idea: if the gas is a binary compound of nitrogen and oxygen that, when dissolved in water, forms a base. But I can't think of any such compound. Most nitrogen oxides are acidic or neutral.\n\nWait, maybe the gas is a binary compound of ammonia and water, but that's a solution, not a gas.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to conclude that there might be an error in the problem or that I'm missing a key insight. Given the information, the most plausible gases that fit the molar mass and combustion criteria are HF (even though it's acidic) and a hydrocarbon like C2H4 (even though its molar mass is out of range). Let's proceed with this, even though it may not be perfect, and see what the sum is.\n\nGas A: HF (20.01 g/mol). Combustion of HF: doesn't burn, so this is invalid. So this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, if gas A is something else. Let me think about the possibility that the gas is a binary compound of hydrogen and another element, and it's a base. The only one I can think of is NH3. Let's proceed with that, despite the molar mass issue, and assume that the problem allows for some flexibility.\n\nGas A: NH3 (combustion produces N2 and H2O). Gas B: Let's assume it's a hydrocarbon with molar mass around 20. The closest is C2H6 (30) or C2H4 (28). Let's take C2H4.\n\nCombustion of C2H4: C2H4 + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O. Products: 2CO2 (2*44=88) + 2H2O (2*18=36) = 124.\n\nSum of products from both reactions: 164 (from NH3) + 124 (from C2H4) = 288. This doesn't match any of the given options. The closest is option A (260-280), but 288 is outside.\n\nWait, maybe the stoichiometric coefficients are different. Let me recheck the combustion equations.\n\nFor NH3: 4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O. So per 4 moles of NH3, the products are 2 moles N2 and 6 moles H2O. The molecular masses would be (2*28) + (6*18) = 56 + 108 = 164.\n\nFor C2H4: 1 mole of C2H4 produces 2 moles CO2 and 2 moles H2O. Molecular masses: 2*44 + 2*18 = 88 + 36 = 124. Total sum: 164 + 124 = 288.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the sum of the molecular masses of the products, taking into account the stoichiometric coefficients as whole numbers, then it's 164 + 124 = 288. This doesn't match any of the given options (A:260-280, B:170-190, C:130-150, D:230-250). So this suggests that my assumptions are wrong.\n\nMaybe the gases are different. Let me think of another possibility. What if gas A is something like PH3 (phosphine, molar mass 34) and gas B is something like H2S (34)? But their molar masses are too high. However, if the problem allows for some error, maybe the density measurement is off. Let's say the actual molar mass is 34, and the measured density gives 0.5*40 = 20, which is a 70% error. No, this is way outside the 2% error.\n\nWait, maybe the gases are not simple compounds but have a different composition. For example, if the gas is a binary compound of two elements, and one of them is a diatomic molecule. For example, if the gas is O2 (32 g/mol), but it's not a binary compound. No.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to conclude that there might be an error in the problem or that I'm missing a key piece of information. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the options provided.\n\nThe options for the sum are:\n\nA: 260-280\n\nB: 170-190\n\nC: 130-150\n\nD: 230-250\n\nIf I consider that the products from both combustion reactions might have a sum in one of these ranges, let's think of possible combinations.\n\nIf gas A is a hydrocarbon like C2H6 (30 g/mol, but molar mass out of range) and gas B is another compound, but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, if gas A is a compound that produces CO2 and H2O, and gas B produces CO2 and H2O as well, then the total would be higher. For example, if both are hydrocarbons, but their molar masses are around 20, which is not possible.\n\nWait, if the gases are both hydrocarbons with molar masses around 20, but no such hydrocarbons exist. The closest is CH4 (16) and C2H6 (30). Let's assume gas A is CH4 and gas B is C2H6, even though their molar masses are out of range.\n\nCombustion of CH4: CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O. Products: 1CO2 (44) + 2H2O (36) = 80.\n\nCombustion of C2H6: 2C2H6 + 7O2 → 4CO2 + 6H2O. Products: 4CO2 (176) + 6H2O (108) = 284.\n\nSum: 80 + 284 = 364. No.\n\nThis is not helpful. Given the options, the most plausible range might be D: 230-250. If the sum is 288, it's close to option A, but not quite. Maybe the actual correct answer is D, and my calculations are off due to incorrect assumptions about the gases.\n\nAlternatively, if gas A is a compound like C2H2 (26 g/mol) and gas B is another compound. Let's say gas A is C2H2 and gas B is something like C2H4.\n\nCombustion of C2H2: 2C2H2 + 5O2 → 4CO2 + 2H2O. Products: 4*44 + 2*18 = 176 + 36 = 212.\n\nCombustion of C2H4: C2H4 + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O. Products: 2*44 + 2*18 = 88 + 36 = 124.\n\nSum: 212 + 124 = 336. No.\n\nIf gas A is a compound like CO (28 g/mol) and gas B is another compound. Combustion of CO: 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. Products: 2*44 = 88.\n\nIf gas B is something like C2H4 (28 g/mol), combustion products 124. Sum: 88 + 124 = 212. This is close to option D (230-250), but not quite.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of the most plausible answer based on the given options. If the sum is around 288, which is close to option A (260-280), but slightly higher. If there's a rounding or calculation error, maybe the correct answer is A. Alternatively, if the actual correct gases have products summing to around 250, then D.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider that the gases are both binary compounds with molar masses around 20, and their combustion products are CO2 and H2O. Let's assume gas A is a compound like CH4 (16) and gas B is a compound like C2H6 (30), but with some error.\n\nCombustion of CH4: CO2 + 2H2O (44 + 36 = 80).\n\nCombustion of C2H6: 2CO2 + 3H2O (88 + 54 = 142).\n\nSum: 80 + 142 = 222, which is close to option D (230-250).\n\nIf the actual gases have slightly higher molar masses, this could be the case. Given that, I might choose option D.\n\nBut this is all speculative. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear path, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is D: from 230 to 250.\n</think>"}
