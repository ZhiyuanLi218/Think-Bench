Let me go through each option one by one and recall what I know about each reaction.\n\nStarting with Option A: Adding NaOH solution to MgCl2 solution until excess. I remember that when you mix a magnesium salt with a strong base like NaOH, magnesium hydroxide should precipitate out because Mg(OH)2 is not very soluble. The reaction would be MgCl2 + 2NaOH → Mg(OH)2↓ + 2NaCl. Now, the question is whether the precipitate would dissolve upon adding excess NaOH. But wait, magnesium hydroxide isn't amphoteric, right? Unlike aluminum hydroxide, which can react with excess NaOH to dissolve, magnesium hydroxide is basic and shouldn't dissolve in excess base. So the white precipitate should remain. Therefore, the predicted phenomenon in A is incorrect because it says the precipitate disappears. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B: Adding KSCN to FeCl2 solution. KSCN is potassium thiocyanate. I know that Fe^3+ ions react with SCN- to form a blood red complex, [Fe(SCN)]^2+ or similar. But FeCl2 contains Fe^2+ ions, not Fe^3+. So unless there's an oxidation happening, adding KSCN to FeCl2 should not turn blood red. However, maybe there's some oxidation of Fe^2+ to Fe^3+ in the presence of air or something? But in the experiment, they just add KSCN directly. If the solution is freshly prepared FeCl2, it might not have oxidized yet. So the expected result should not be blood red. Therefore, the prediction in B is incorrect. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: Adding NaCl solution to AgI suspension until excess. AgI is a yellow precipitate. The question is whether adding NaCl would cause AgI to convert to AgCl. Solubility product comes into play here. I remember that AgCl has a higher solubility product (Ksp) compared to AgI. Let me recall the Ksp values. AgCl is around 1.8×10^-10, AgBr is lower, and AgI is even lower, maybe around 8.5×10^-17? Since AgI is less soluble than AgCl, adding Cl- ions wouldn't precipitate AgCl out from AgI. Wait, but if you have AgI suspension and add NaCl, the common ion effect would suppress the solubility of AgCl, but since AgI is less soluble, it's more stable. Therefore, AgI won't convert to AgCl. In fact, the opposite might happen if you had AgCl and added I- ions. So the yellow precipitate (AgI) should remain. Therefore, the predicted phenomenon in C is incorrect because it says it converts to white precipitate (AgCl). So C is wrong.\n\nOption D: Adding ethanol until excess to acidic KMnO4 solution. Acidic KMnO4 is purple. Ethanol is an organic compound. I remember that KMnO4 in acidic conditions is a strong oxidizing agent. Ethanol can be oxidized by KMnO4. For example, ethanol can be oxidized to acetic acid or other products, and in the process, the MnO4^- is reduced. In acidic conditions, MnO4^- is reduced to Mn^2+ which is colorless. So when ethanol is added to acidic KMnO4, the purple color would fade as the MnO4^- is consumed. This reaction might proceed until the ethanol is in excess. Therefore, the predicted phenomenon in D is correct: the purple-red color fades. So D is correct.\n\nSo the correct option is D. Let me check again:\n\nA: Mg(OH)2 doesn't dissolve in excess NaOH. Correct, so A's prediction is wrong.\n\nB: Fe^2+ doesn't form blood red with SCN- unless oxidized. So B is wrong.\n\nC: AgI is less soluble than AgCl, so no conversion. C is wrong.\n\nD: Ethanol is oxidized by acidic KMnO4, causing decolorization. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
