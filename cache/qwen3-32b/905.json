The bullet's velocity relative to the spaceship is given as (0.3c, 0.1c, 0.3c). Hmm, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. There's something called the velocity addition formula, right?\n\nLet me recall. The relativistic velocity addition formula is different for each direction. Since the spaceship is moving along the x-axis relative to Earth, I think the formulas for the x-component and the perpendicular components (y and z) are different. \n\nFor the x-component of the bullet's velocity as seen from Earth, the formula should be:\n\nu'_x = (u_x + v) / (1 + (u_x v)/c²)\n\nWhere u_x is the bullet's x-component relative to the spaceship, v is the spaceship's velocity relative to Earth, and u'_x is the bullet's x-component relative to Earth.\n\nGiven that the spaceship is moving at 0.5c along the x-axis, so v = 0.5c. The bullet's velocity relative to the spaceship is (0.3c, 0.1c, 0.3c), so u_x = 0.3c, u_y = 0.1c, u_z = 0.3c.\n\nSo let me compute the x-component first.\n\nu'_x = (0.3c + 0.5c) / (1 + (0.3c * 0.5c)/c²) = (0.8c) / (1 + 0.15) = 0.8c / 1.15 ≈ 0.7c approximately?\n\nWait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.8 divided by 1.15. Let me do the division: 0.8 / 1.15. Let me compute 1.15 × 0.7 = 0.805. Oh, so 0.8 / 1.15 is approximately 0.6956... So approximately 0.696c? Let me check with decimals. 1.15 × 0.6956 ≈ 1.15 × 0.6956. Let me compute 1.15 × 0.7 = 0.805, subtract 1.15 × 0.0044 ≈ 0.00506, so approximately 0.8 - 0.00506 ≈ 0.7949? Wait, maybe I messed up the math here. Let me just do 0.8 divided by 1.15.\n\nLet me convert that to numbers. 0.8 / 1.15. Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to remove decimals: 80 / 115. Simplify. Both divide by 5: 16 / 23. Let me compute 16 divided by 23. 23 × 0.7 is 16.1, so 0.7 - a tiny bit less. So approximately 0.6956c. So approximately 0.696c. Let me note that as u'_x ≈ 0.6956c.\n\nNow for the y and z components. The formulas for the perpendicular components are different. I think they are:\n\nu'_y = (u_y) / [γ (1 + (u_x v)/c²)]\n\nSimilarly for u'_z.\n\nWait, let me recall the exact formula. In special relativity, when you have a velocity in a moving frame, the transformation for perpendicular components involves dividing by gamma factor. Let me check.\n\nThe general Lorentz transformation for velocity. Suppose the spaceship is moving along the x-axis with velocity v relative to Earth. Then the transformation equations for velocity components are:\n\nu'_x = (u_x + v) / (1 + (u_x v)/c²)\n\nu'_y = (u_y) / [γ (1 + (u_x v)/c²)]\n\nu'_z = (u_z) / [γ (1 + (u_x v)/c²)]\n\nWhere γ is the Lorentz factor for the spaceship's velocity v, so γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).\n\nSo first, let me compute γ for the spaceship's velocity. Since v = 0.5c, then:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.\n\nSo γ ≈ 1.1547.\n\nNow, let's compute the denominator term (1 + (u_x v)/c²). We already computed this earlier when calculating u'_x, which was 1 + (0.3c * 0.5c)/c² = 1 + 0.15 = 1.15.\n\nTherefore, for u'_y and u'_z:\n\nu'_y = u_y / [γ * 1.15] and similarly for u'_z.\n\nGiven that u_y = 0.1c and u_z = 0.3c.\n\nSo let's compute u'_y first:\n\nu'_y = 0.1c / [1.1547 * 1.15] ≈ 0.1c / [1.3279] ≈ 0.0753c.\n\nSimilarly, u'_z = 0.3c / [1.1547 * 1.15] ≈ 0.3c / 1.3279 ≈ 0.226c.\n\nLet me verify the denominator again. γ is approximately 1.1547 and the other term is 1.15. Multiplying them: 1.1547 * 1.15 ≈ 1.15 * 1.15 = 1.3225, but since 1.1547 is slightly larger than 1.15, so maybe approximately 1.1547 * 1.15 ≈ 1.3279. Let me compute 1.1547 * 1.15:\n\nFirst, 1 * 1.15 = 1.15\n\n0.1547 * 1.15 ≈ 0.1547 * 1 + 0.1547 * 0.15 ≈ 0.1547 + 0.0232 ≈ 0.1779\n\nSo total is approx 1.15 + 0.1779 ≈ 1.3279. Yes, that's correct. So denominator ≈ 1.3279.\n\nTherefore:\n\nu'_y ≈ 0.1 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.0753c\n\nu'_z ≈ 0.3 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.226c\n\nSo now, the velocity components in Earth's frame are approximately:\n\nu'_x ≈ 0.6956c\n\nu'_y ≈ 0.0753c\n\nu'_z ≈ 0.226c\n\nNow, to find the magnitude of the velocity vector, we need to compute the square root of (u'_x² + u'_y² + u'_z²), then multiply by c? Wait, no, since each component is already in terms of c. Let me clarify:\n\nEach component is a fraction of c. For example, u'_x ≈ 0.6956c, so when we compute the magnitude squared, it would be (0.6956c)^2 + (0.0753c)^2 + (0.226c)^2. Then take the square root and divide by c? Wait, no:\n\nActually, the magnitude of velocity is sqrt( (u'_x)^2 + (u'_y)^2 + (u'_z)^2 ). Since each component is already in units of c, let's compute the numerical value.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, (u'_x)^2 ≈ (0.6956)^2 ≈ 0.4838c²\n\n(u'_y)^2 ≈ (0.0753)^2 ≈ 0.0057c²\n\n(u'_z)^2 ≈ (0.226)^2 ≈ 0.0511c²\n\nAdding them up: 0.4838 + 0.0057 + 0.0511 ≈ 0.5406c²\n\nThen the magnitude is sqrt(0.5406)c ≈ 0.735c.\n\nLooking at the options, C is ~0.73c. So that would be the answer?\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I approximated several steps. Maybe I made an error in approximating the numbers?\n\nLet me redo the calculations with more precision.\n\nFirst, let me recalculate u'_x.\n\nu'_x = (0.3c + 0.5c) / (1 + (0.3 * 0.5)) since the c cancels in the denominator term. Because (u_x v)/c² = (0.3c * 0.5c)/c² = 0.15c²/c² = 0.15. So denominator is 1 + 0.15 = 1.15. Numerator is 0.8c. So 0.8 / 1.15.\n\nLet me compute 0.8 divided by 1.15 precisely. Let me do decimal division:\n\n1.15 × 0.7 = 0.805. So 0.7 gives 0.805 which is slightly more than 0.8. So the actual value is 0.7 - (0.805 - 0.8)/1.15 per 0.1 decrement?\n\nWait, maybe better to compute:\n\nLet me write 0.8 / 1.15 = ?\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate decimals: 1.6 / 2.3 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 2.3 × 0.695 = 2.3 × 0.6 + 2.3 × 0.095 = 1.38 + 0.2185 = 1.5985. Which is very close to 1.6. The difference is 1.6 - 1.5985 = 0.0015. So 0.695 + (0.0015 / 2.3). 0.0015 / 2.3 ≈ 0.00065. So total is approximately 0.69565. Therefore, u'_x ≈ 0.69565c ≈ 0.6957c.\n\nSo squaring that: (0.6957)^2. Let me calculate:\n\n0.7^2 is 0.49. 0.6957 is 0.7 - 0.0043. So (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².\n\nSo (0.7 - 0.0043)^2 = 0.49 - 2*0.7*0.0043 + (0.0043)^2 ≈ 0.49 - 0.00602 + 0.000018 ≈ 0.48398. So approx 0.484. So that's consistent with my previous value of 0.4838. So that's okay.\n\nNow for u'_y and u'_z. Let me recalculate them with more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, compute γ. For v = 0.5c, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75). Let me compute sqrt(0.75) more accurately. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660254. Therefore, γ ≈ 1 / 0.8660254 ≈ 1.1547005.\n\nThen, the denominator term is γ*(1 + (u_x v)/c²) = γ * 1.15 ≈ 1.1547005 * 1.15. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 1.1547005 × 1.15:\n\nBreak it down as 1.15 × 1.1547005.\n\nWell, 1.15 × 1 = 1.15\n\n1.15 × 0.1547005 ≈ Let's compute 1.15 × 0.15 = 0.1725, and 1.15 × 0.0047005 ≈ 0.005405575. Adding those gives approx 0.1725 + 0.0054 ≈ 0.1779.\n\nTherefore total is approx 1.15 + 0.1779 ≈ 1.3279. So same as before. Therefore, the denominator is approx 1.3279.\n\nTherefore, u'_y = 0.1c / 1.3279 ≈ 0.0753c. Let me compute 0.1 / 1.3279:\n\nLet me do 0.1 / 1.3279 ≈ Let me approximate 1 / 1.3279. Let me note that 1 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.7535. Because 1.3279 × 0.75 = 0.9959, and 1.3279 × 0.753 ≈ 1.3279*(0.75 + 0.003) = 0.9959 + 0.00398 ≈ 0.9999. Therefore, 1 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.753. Therefore, 0.1 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.0753. So u'_y ≈ 0.0753c. Squared, that is approx (0.0753)^2 ≈ 0.00567.\n\nSimilarly, u'_z = 0.3 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.3 * 0.753 ≈ 0.2259c. Squared, (0.2259)^2 ≈ 0.0510.\n\nAdding up the squares:\n\nu'_x² ≈ 0.484\n\nu'_y² ≈ 0.00567\n\nu'_z² ≈ 0.0510\n\nTotal ≈ 0.484 + 0.00567 + 0.0510 ≈ 0.54067\n\nTherefore, magnitude is sqrt(0.54067) ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.54067). Let me note that 0.73^2 = 0.5329 and 0.74^2 = 0.5476. Since 0.54067 is between 0.5329 and 0.5476, so between 0.73 and 0.74.\n\nCompute 0.73^2 = 0.5329\n\nDifference: 0.54067 - 0.5329 = 0.00777\n\nNow, let me approximate sqrt(0.54067). Let me use linear approximation between 0.73 and 0.74.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = x². We know f(0.73) = 0.5329, f(0.74) = 0.5476. We want to find x such that f(x) = 0.54067.\n\nLet me compute the difference between 0.54067 and 0.5329: 0.00777. The total interval between 0.73 and 0.74 is 0.01 in x, corresponding to a difference in f(x) of 0.5476 - 0.5329 = 0.0147.\n\nSo the fraction is 0.00777 / 0.0147 ≈ 0.528. Therefore, x ≈ 0.73 + 0.528*(0.01) ≈ 0.73 + 0.00528 ≈ 0.73528. Therefore, approx 0.7353c.\n\nSo approximately 0.735c. The options are C: ~0.73c. So that would be the answer. But let me check if my approximated value is precise enough. Maybe I need to compute sqrt(0.54067) more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me try 0.735^2:\n\n0.735^2 = (0.7 + 0.035)^2 = 0.7² + 2*0.7*0.035 + 0.035² = 0.49 + 0.049 + 0.001225 = 0.49 + 0.049 is 0.539 + 0.001225 = 0.540225. \n\nOur target is 0.54067. The difference is 0.54067 - 0.540225 = 0.000445.\n\nNow, let's compute the derivative of f(x) = x² at x = 0.735 is 2*0.735 = 1.47. So, to find the delta_x such that f(x + delta_x) ≈ f(x) + 1.47 * delta_x = 0.540225 + 1.47 * delta_x = 0.54067. Therefore, delta_x ≈ (0.54067 - 0.540225)/1.47 ≈ 0.000445 / 1.47 ≈ 0.0003. So x ≈ 0.735 + 0.0003 = 0.7353. Therefore, sqrt(0.54067) ≈ 0.7353c. So approx 0.735c. Which is 0.735c, so ~0.73c when rounded to two decimal places. Hence, option C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if my calculation of the components is correct. Because maybe I made a mistake in the transformation formulas?\n\nLet me double-check the formulas for the perpendicular components. The formula for u'_y is u_y / [γ (1 + (u_x v)/c² ) ]? Or is it u_y / γ (1 + ... )? Wait, let me check.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for velocity components when the motion is along the x-axis:\n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nu'_x = (u_x + v) / (1 + (u_x v)/c² )\n\nu'_y = (u_y) / [ γ (1 + (u_x v)/c² ) ]\n\nu'_z = (u_z) / [ γ (1 + (u_x v)/c² ) ]\n\nYes, that's correct. Because when you have a boost along x, the perpendicular components get divided by gamma and also scaled by the same denominator as the x-component. So my calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the components I calculated are correct. Therefore, the magnitude is approx 0.735c, so answer C: ~0.73c.\n\nBut let me check if there is another approach or if I made a mistake in assuming the formulas. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the invariant quantity of the velocity 4-vector? Not sure. Alternatively, compute the speed using beta factors?\n\nAlternatively, check with another method. Suppose we consider the velocity 4-vector. The four-velocity is (γ_total c, γ_total v_x, γ_total v_y, γ_total v_z). But maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check if the speed calculated is less than c. Since 0.735c is less than c, which is good. Also, if I had added the speeds classically, the speed would be sqrt( (0.8c)^2 + (0.1c)^2 + (0.3c)^2 ) = sqrt( 0.64 + 0.01 + 0.09 )c = sqrt(0.74)c ≈ 0.86c, which is option D. But since we are in relativity, the actual speed should be less than that, which is indeed the case here (0.735c < 0.86c). So that makes sense. So option C is the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in calculating the components? Let me check u'_y and u'_z again.\n\nGiven u'_y = u_y / [ γ (1 + (u_x v)/c² ) ]\n\nWe had u_y = 0.1c, γ ≈ 1.1547, denominator term 1 + ... = 1.15. So denominator is 1.1547 * 1.15 ≈ 1.3279. Then u'_y = 0.1 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.0753. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for u_z. So that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if I used the correct velocity addition formula. For example, if the bullet was fired along x-axis, then we would have u'_x = 0.8c / 1.15 ≈ 0.695c, which is less than c, as it should be. So that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with exact fractions.\n\nLet me try to compute more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(3/4) ) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.154700538.\n\nDenominator term for u'_y and u'_z is γ*(1 + 0.15) = (2 / sqrt(3)) * 1.15.\n\nCompute 1.15 as 23/20. So:\n\nDenominator term is (2 / sqrt(3)) * (23/20) = (23 / 10 sqrt(3)) ≈ ?\n\nBut maybe not helpful. Let me compute numerically:\n\nγ * 1.15 ≈ 1.154700538 * 1.15 ≈ Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 1 * 1.15 = 1.15\n\n0.154700538 * 1.15 ≈ 0.154700538 * 1 + 0.154700538 * 0.15 ≈ 0.154700538 + 0.02320508 ≈ 0.177905618\n\nTotal denominator ≈ 1.15 + 0.177905618 ≈ 1.327905618.\n\nTherefore, u'_y = 0.1 / 1.327905618 ≈ Let me compute this division precisely.\n\nLet me write 0.1 / 1.327905618.\n\nLet me note that 1 / 1.327905618 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 1 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.753. Let me compute 1.327905618 × 0.753:\n\nFirst, 1.3279 × 0.7 = 0.92953\n\n1.3279 × 0.05 = 0.066395\n\n1.3279 × 0.003 = 0.0039837\n\nAdding up: 0.92953 + 0.066395 = 0.995925 + 0.0039837 ≈ 0.9999087. Wow, very close to 1. Therefore, 1 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.753. Therefore, 0.1 / 1.3279 ≈ 0.0753. So that's precise.\n\nTherefore, u'_y ≈ 0.0753c, u'_z ≈ 0.2259c.\n\nSo then, the magnitude squared is:\n\n(0.69565)^2 + (0.0753)^2 + (0.2259)^2 ≈ Let me compute each term with more precision.\n\nFirst term: 0.69565². Let me compute 0.69565 * 0.69565.\n\nLet me note that 0.69565 is approx 0.6956 + 0.00005. Let me use the value from earlier, which was approx 0.484 when squared. But let me do exact multiplication:\n\nLet me write 0.69565 × 0.69565:\n\nFirst, compute 0.69565^2:\n\n= (0.6 + 0.09565)^2\n\n= 0.6² + 2*0.6*0.09565 + (0.09565)^2\n\n= 0.36 + 0.11478 + 0.009149\n\n= 0.36 + 0.11478 = 0.47478 + 0.009149 ≈ 0.483929.\n\nSo approx 0.4839.\n\nSecond term: 0.0753² = 0.00567.\n\nThird term: 0.2259². Let me compute:\n\n0.2259 × 0.2259. Let me note that 0.225² = 0.050625. Let me compute (0.225 + 0.0009)^2 = 0.225² + 2*0.225*0.0009 + 0.0009² ≈ 0.050625 + 0.000405 + 0.00000081 ≈ 0.0510308. However, our value is 0.2259, which is 0.225 + 0.0009, so same as above. Wait, but 0.2259 is actually 0.2259, which is 0.225 + 0.0009? No, 0.225 + 0.0009 is 0.2259. Yes. So squared is approx 0.05103.\n\nTherefore, total magnitude squared is approx 0.4839 + 0.00567 + 0.05103 ≈ 0.4839 + 0.0567 ≈ 0.5406. So sqrt(0.5406) ≈ 0.735c as before.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude is approximately 0.735c, which is closest to option C: ~0.73c. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check if there is any chance I messed up the formulas. For example, if I had forgotten to divide by gamma in the y and z components, I would have gotten different results. Let me check what would happen if I didn't divide by gamma.\n\nIf someone erroneously uses u'_y = u_y / (1 + ...), then:\n\nu'_y = 0.1c / 1.15 ≈ 0.08696c, similarly u'_z ≈ 0.2609c. Then magnitude squared would be:\n\n(0.6956)^2 + (0.08696)^2 + (0.2609)^2 ≈ 0.4839 + 0.00756 + 0.068 ≈ 0.5595, sqrt ≈ 0.748c. Which is closer to 0.75c, but still closest to option C. However, since we did include the gamma factor, which reduces the y and z components further, leading to 0.735c, which is even closer to 0.73c.\n\nAlternatively, if someone used classical addition, they would get sqrt( (0.8c)^2 + (0.1c)^2 + (0.3c)^2 ) = sqrt( 0.64 + 0.01 + 0.09 ) = sqrt(0.74) ≈ 0.86c, which is option D. But since we are in relativity, the correct answer is less than that, so C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using exact relativistic formula for the speed.\n\nThere's a formula for the magnitude of the velocity in Earth's frame. Alternatively, using the invariant quantity of the square of the velocity 4-vector? Wait, the square of the four-velocity is -c² (for massive particles), but maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use the relation between the speed in different frames. But perhaps not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, check with another method. For example, compute the gamma factor of the bullet in Earth's frame and see if it matches.\n\nBut maybe not necessary. Given that all steps check out and the approximate value is 0.735c, which is 0.73c when rounded to two decimal places, and given that option C is ~0.73c, I think that is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, I conclude the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
