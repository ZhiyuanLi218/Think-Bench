Let me try to break down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says a relativistic proton passes through a 1 cm thick scintillator and loses 1.8 MeV of energy. Then, it mentions that on average a proton can produce one photon for every 100 eV of energy lost. Then there's a light guide with 10% transmission efficiency and a photomultiplier with 10% conversion efficiency. The question is about the relative error σ. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nLet me start by recalling what relative error means. In the context of measurements, the relative error is the ratio of the absolute error to the measured value. But here, I think the question is referring to the statistical error, which for counting processes like this (photons produced, transmitted, converted) would follow Poisson statistics. In Poisson statistics, the standard deviation (absolute error) is the square root of the number of counts, and the relative error is the square root of the number of counts divided by the number of counts, which simplifies to 1 over the square root of the number of counts. So σ = 1/√N, where N is the number of counts. Therefore, I need to find N, the number of photoelectrons produced, and then compute 1/√N to get the relative error.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of photons produced by the scintillator due to the 1.8 MeV energy loss.\n2. Apply the transmission efficiency of the light guide (10%) to find the number of photons reaching the photomultiplier.\n3. Apply the conversion efficiency of the photomultiplier (10%) to find the number of photoelectrons produced (N).\n4. Calculate the relative error σ = 1/√N and convert it to a percentage.\n\nLet me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the energy loss is 1.8 MeV. The problem states that one photon is produced per 100 eV of energy lost. So I need to convert 1.8 MeV to eV and divide by 100 eV per photon.\n\n1.8 MeV is 1.8 × 10^6 eV. So number of photons produced by scintillator:\n\nN_photons_scintillator = (1.8 × 10^6 eV) / (100 eV/photon) = 1.8 × 10^4 photons. Let me check that calculation again. 1.8 MeV is 1,800,000 eV. Divided by 100 eV per photon gives 18,000 photons. So yes, 1.8 × 10^4 photons.\n\nNext, the light guide has a transmission efficiency of 10%, so only 10% of those photons reach the photomultiplier. So:\n\nN_photons_PM = N_photons_scintillator × 0.10 = 1.8 × 10^4 × 0.10 = 1.8 × 10^3 photons.\n\nThen, the photomultiplier converts photons to photoelectrons with 10% efficiency. So:\n\nN_photoelectrons = N_photons_PM × 0.10 = 1.8 × 10^3 × 0.10 = 1.8 × 10^2 = 180 photoelectrons.\n\nTherefore, the total number of photoelectrons N is 180. Now, the relative error σ is 1/√N. Let me compute that.\n\n√180 ≈ 13.4164. Therefore, 1/13.4164 ≈ 0.0745, which is approximately 7.45%. Converting to percentage, that's roughly 7.5%. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 7.5%. Therefore, the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other factors I might have missed. For example, is the relative error calculated correctly? The question says \"relative error σ of the pulse height output by the photomultiplier\". The pulse height is proportional to the number of photoelectrons, right? So if the number of photoelectrons is N, then the statistical fluctuation (standard deviation) is √N, so the relative error is √N / N = 1/√N. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if there are multiple steps with efficiencies, does each step contribute its own error? Wait, but efficiencies are deterministic factors. They scale the number of photons, but they don't add statistical error themselves. The statistical error comes only from the stochastic processes, which are the production of photons in the scintillator, transmission through the light guide (if there was a probabilistic process, but here it's given as a transmission efficiency, so maybe it's considered deterministic?), and the conversion in the photomultiplier. Wait, actually, in reality, the transmission through the light guide and the conversion in the photomultiplier are probabilistic processes. So each of those steps would have their own Poisson statistics? Or is the efficiency already taking into account the probability?\n\nThis is a crucial point. Let me think. If the transmission efficiency is 10%, does that mean that each photon has a 10% chance to be transmitted, making the number of transmitted photons a Poisson variable with mean N_photons_scintillator × 0.1? Similarly, the conversion efficiency is 10%, so each photon has a 10% chance to produce a photoelectron. In that case, the total number of photoelectrons would be a Poisson variable with mean N_photons_scintillator × 0.1 × 0.1 = N. However, the variance would also be N, because each step is a Poisson process. Wait, but actually, if you have a Poisson distribution with mean λ, and then you take each event and apply a probability p of keeping it, then the resulting distribution is Poisson with mean pλ. Therefore, the variance is also pλ. Therefore, the total variance is the same as the mean. Therefore, the total number of photoelectrons is Poisson distributed with mean N = 180 and variance N = 180. Therefore, the standard deviation is sqrt(N), and the relative error is 1/sqrt(N). Therefore, my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, regardless of the number of steps, as long as each step is a Poisson process with some efficiency, the total variance is equal to the mean. Therefore, the relative error is 1/sqrt(N). Therefore, my answer of approximately 7.5% is correct, so option B.\n\nBut let me check again the numbers:\n\nTotal energy: 1.8 MeV = 1,800,000 eV.\n\nPhotons produced: 1,800,000 / 100 = 18,000.\n\nAfter light guide (10%): 18,000 × 0.1 = 1,800.\n\nAfter photomultiplier (10%): 1,800 × 0.1 = 180.\n\nTherefore N = 180. sqrt(180) ≈ 13.416. 1/13.416 ≈ 0.0745, so 7.45%, which is approximately 7.5%. Therefore, answer B.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach where the error is calculated step by step. Suppose each step has its own error. For example, first the production of photons in the scintillator. The number of photons produced is 18,000. The error here would be sqrt(18,000). Then, after transmission, the number is 1,800, with error sqrt(1,800). Then after conversion, the number is 180, with error sqrt(180). However, the relative error at each step would be:\n\nAfter scintillator: sqrt(18,000)/18,000 ≈ 1/sqrt(18,000) ≈ 0.00745 or 0.745%.\n\nAfter transmission: sqrt(1,800)/1,800 ≈ 1/sqrt(1,800) ≈ 0.0236 or 2.36%.\n\nAfter conversion: sqrt(180)/180 ≈ 0.0745 or 7.45%.\n\nSo regardless of how you look at it, the relative error ends up being 7.45% at the end. Because each step, even though you have a deterministic scaling of the number of particles, the relative error remains the same? Wait no, actually, when you have a Poisson distribution, if you scale the mean by a factor, the relative error remains the same. Because if you have N ~ Poisson(λ), then Var(N) = λ, so relative error is sqrt(λ)/λ = 1/sqrt(λ). If you then take a fraction p of N, then the new variable M = p*N, which would be Poisson(pλ) if p is a probability. Therefore, Var(M) = pλ, and relative error is sqrt(pλ)/pλ = 1/sqrt(pλ). Which is the same as 1/sqrt(new mean). Therefore, regardless of the steps, the relative error at the end is 1/sqrt(final mean). Therefore, my original approach is correct. So the answer is B) 7.5%.\n\nBut let me check if the question is perhaps considering some other kind of error. For example, maybe the energy loss itself has an error? But the problem says \"the relative error σ of the pulse height output by the photomultiplier\". The pulse height is proportional to the number of photoelectrons, which is a measured quantity. The error in the measurement is statistical, due to the Poissonian fluctuations in the number of photons produced, transmitted, and converted. Therefore, the calculation as done is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if there were systematic errors in the efficiencies, but the problem does not mention any uncertainties in the efficiencies (transmission 10%, conversion 10%). The problem gives these as fixed values. Therefore, the only error is statistical, which is 1/sqrt(N). Therefore, answer B.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact value. Let me compute 1/sqrt(180) more accurately. \n\nFirst, sqrt(180) is sqrt(100*1.8) = 10*sqrt(1.8). sqrt(1.8) is approx 1.3416, so 10*1.3416 ≈ 13.416. Therefore 1/13.416 ≈ 0.074535... Multiply by 100% gives 7.45%, which rounds to 7.5%. Therefore, option B is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
