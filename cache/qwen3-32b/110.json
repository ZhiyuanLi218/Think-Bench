The options are line, circle, parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola. Let me start by recalling some polar equations and how they translate to Cartesian coordinates.\n\nFirst, I know that in polar coordinates, $ r $ is the radius, $ \\theta $ is the angle, and there are some standard conversions to Cartesian coordinates: $ x = r \\cos \\theta $, $ y = r \\sin \\theta $, and $ r^2 = x^2 + y^2 $. Also, there's an identity for $ \\cos 2\\theta $. Let me remember that... I think it's $ \\cos 2\\theta = \\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta $. Alternatively, it can also be written as $ 2\\cos^2 \\theta - 1 $ or $ 1 - 2\\sin^2 \\theta $. Maybe one of these forms will be helpful here.\n\nGiven the equation $ r^2 \\cos 2\\theta = 4 $, let me substitute the identity for $ \\cos 2\\theta $. Let me use $ \\cos 2\\theta = \\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta $. So substituting that in, the equation becomes:\n\n$ r^2 (\\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta) = 4 $.\n\nNow, let me see if I can express this in terms of x and y. Since $ x = r \\cos \\theta $, then $ x^2 = r^2 \\cos^2 \\theta $. Similarly, $ y^2 = r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta $. Therefore, $ r^2 \\cos^2 \\theta - r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta = x^2 - y^2 $. Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation is $ x^2 - y^2 $. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n$ x^2 - y^2 = 4 $.\n\nWait, so that's the equation? If so, then this is a hyperbola because it's of the form $ \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 $, which is a standard hyperbola equation. Comparing $ x^2 - y^2 = 4 $ with the standard form, we can divide both sides by 4 to get $ \\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{4} = 1 $, which is a hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation:\n\n$ r^2 \\cos 2\\theta = 4 $.\n\nUsing $ \\cos 2\\theta = \\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta $, so:\n\nLeft-hand side becomes $ r^2 (\\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta) $, which is $ r^2 \\cos^2 \\theta - r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta $. Then since $ x = r \\cos \\theta $, $ x^2 = r^2 \\cos^2 \\theta $, similarly for $ y^2 $. Therefore, substituting gives $ x^2 - y^2 $. Therefore, equation is $ x^2 - y^2 = 4 $. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try another identity for $ \\cos 2\\theta $. For example, $ \\cos 2\\theta = \\frac{1 - \\tan^2 \\theta}{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta} $, but I don't know if that helps here. Alternatively, maybe using $ r^2 \\cos 2\\theta = 4 $, and recall that $ \\cos 2\\theta = \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} $. Wait, since $ x^2 - y^2 = r^2 \\cos 2\\theta $. Therefore, substituting back into the original equation:\n\nOriginal equation is $ r^2 \\cos 2\\theta = 4 $, so replacing $ \\cos 2\\theta $ with $ \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} $, we get:\n\n$ r^2 \\cdot \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} = 4 $, which simplifies to $ x^2 - y^2 = 4 $. Same result. So that's consistent. Therefore, the Cartesian equation is indeed $ x^2 - y^2 = 4 $, which is a hyperbola.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be (E) Hyperbola.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this equation could be interpreted or another form that might suggest a different conic section. For example, sometimes polar equations of conic sections are given in terms of $ r = $ something involving $ \\cos \\theta $ or $ \\sin \\theta $, but here it's $ r^2 \\cos 2\\theta = 4 $. So maybe another approach is to think about polar equations of conic sections?\n\nAlternatively, maybe trying to graph it or think about specific points. For example, when $ \\theta = 0 $, then $ \\cos 0 = 1 $, so equation becomes $ r^2 * 1 = 4 $, so $ r = 2 $. Therefore, the point (r, θ) is (2, 0), which is (2, 0) in Cartesian coordinates. Similarly, when $ \\theta = \\pi/2 $, then $ \\cos 2\\theta = \\cos \\pi = -1 $, so equation becomes $ r^2 * (-1) = 4 $, so $ r^2 = -4 $, which is not possible in real numbers. Therefore, there's no point at θ = π/2. Similarly, when θ = π/4, then $ \\cos 2θ = cos(π/2) = 0, so equation becomes 0 = 4, which is impossible. So there's no point at θ = π/4. \n\nSo for θ between -π/4 and π/4, cos 2θ is positive, so r^2 is positive, so possible. For θ beyond π/4, cos 2θ becomes negative, so r^2 would have to be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, the curve only exists where cos 2θ is positive, which is in the regions where θ is between -π/4 to π/4 and between 3π/4 to 5π/4 (but wait, cos 2θ is positive when 2θ is in (-π/2 + 2πk, π/2 + 2πk), so θ in (-π/4 + πk, π/4 + πk). So that would be in the first and third quadrants? Wait, θ between -π/4 and π/4 is first and fourth? Wait θ between -π/4 and π/4 is between -45 degrees and +45 degrees, so that's the right side, between the positive x-axis and 45 degrees up and down. Then between 3π/4 and 5π/4, that's θ between 135 degrees and 225 degrees, which is left side, between 135 and 225 degrees.\n\nBut if I think of the hyperbola $ x^2 - y^2 = 4 $, it has two branches, one on the right and one on the left. In polar coordinates, when θ is between -π/4 and π/4, we can have points on the right branch, and when θ is between π - π/4 = 3π/4 and π + π/4 = 5π/4, that would correspond to angles in the second and third quadrants? Wait, but cos 2θ is positive there? Let me check θ = 3π/4. Then 2θ is 3π/2, cos 3π/2 is 0. Wait, no. Wait θ between π/4 and 3π/4, 2θ is between π/2 and 3π/2, so cos 2θ is negative there. Whereas θ between 3π/4 and 5π/4, 2θ is between 3π/2 and 5π/2, but cos is periodic with period 2π, so cos 2θ between 3π/2 and 5π/2 is same as between -π/2 and π/2, which is positive? Wait, no. Let me take θ = π/2. Then 2θ = π, cos π = -1. θ = 3π/4, 2θ = 3π/2, cos 3π/2 = 0. θ = 5π/4, 2θ = 5π/2, which is equivalent to π/2, cos π/2 = 0. So between θ = π/2 and θ = π, 2θ is between π and 2π, so cos 2θ is positive between 3π/2 and 2π, which corresponds to θ between 3π/4 and π. Similarly, θ between -π and -3π/4? So the regions where cos 2θ is positive are θ between -π/4 and π/4, θ between π/4 and 3π/4? No, wait, cos 2θ is positive when 2θ is in (-π/2 + 2πk, π/2 + 2πk). So θ in (-π/4 + πk, π/4 + πk). Therefore, for k=0: θ in (-π/4, π/4); for k=1: θ in (3π/4, 5π/4). So between 3π/4 and 5π/4, which is from 135 degrees to 225 degrees. In that interval, θ is in the second and third quadrants. So in these regions, cos 2θ is positive. Therefore, in these angles, we can solve for r^2 = 4 / cos 2θ. Since cos 2θ is positive here, r^2 is positive, so r is real. Therefore, in these regions, there are points on the curve. Therefore, in total, the curve has two branches, one in the right side (angles near 0) and one in the left side (angles near π). Which is consistent with the hyperbola $ x^2 - y^2 = 4 $, which has two branches opening left and right. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of θ = π/6 (30 degrees), which is within -π/4 and π/4? π/4 is 45 degrees, so π/6 is within that range. So cos 2θ = cos(π/3) = 0.5. Therefore, r^2 * 0.5 = 4 => r^2 = 8 => r = 2√2. Therefore, the point is (r, θ) = (2√2, π/6). Converting to Cartesian coordinates: x = r cos θ = 2√2 cos(π/6) = 2√2*(√3/2) = √6 ≈ 2.45. Similarly, y = 2√2 sin(π/6) = 2√2*(1/2) = √2 ≈ 1.41. Then x² - y² ≈ (6) - (2) = 4, which checks out. So that point is on the hyperbola.\n\nSimilarly, take θ = 3π/4 + π/6? Wait, let's take θ = π + π/4? No, let me take θ = π/2 + π/4 = 3π/4? Wait θ = 3π/4 is the boundary. Let me take θ = π. Then 2θ = 2π, cos 2π = 1. Therefore, r² * 1 = 4, so r = 2. Therefore, the point (r, θ) is (2, π), which is (-2, 0) in Cartesian coordinates. And indeed, (-2)^2 - 0^2 = 4, which satisfies the equation. So that's on the left branch of the hyperbola.\n\nSo all these checks seem to confirm that the equation converts to $ x^2 - y^2 = 4 $, which is a hyperbola. Therefore, the answer should be (E) Hyperbola.\n\nBut let me just think again if there's a different approach where maybe it's a different conic. For example, sometimes polar equations can represent circles, lines, etc., depending on the form. The general polar form for a conic is $ r = \\frac{ed}{1 + e \\cos \\theta} $ or something like that, where e is the eccentricity. But this equation is $ r^2 \\cos 2\\theta = 4 $, which isn't in that standard form. However, since converting to Cartesian coordinates gives a clear hyperbola, I think that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the equation $ r^2 \\cos 2\\theta = 4 $. Since $ \\cos 2\\theta $ can be positive or negative, but multiplied by $ r^2 $, which is positive. So the equation requires that $ \\cos 2\\theta $ must be positive, otherwise there's no real solution. Therefore, the curve exists only where $ \\cos 2\\theta $ is positive, which as discussed earlier, is in those angular regions. But regardless of that, once converted to Cartesian coordinates, it's a hyperbola. So I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{E}\n</think>"}
