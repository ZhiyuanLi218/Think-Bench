The cube has the shortest possible side lengths, meaning that the sphere is inscribed in such a way that it touches the cube's faces without any extra space. Wait, but actually, if you're making a sphere by removing metal from the corners of a cube, maybe the sphere isn't inscribed in the cube in the traditional sense? Hmm, maybe I need to think about how a sphere can fit inside a cube when you remove material from the cube's corners.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the volume of the sphere is (4/3)πr³. But the problem isn't asking for the volume of the sphere; it's asking for the volume of the original cube. The sphere is made by removing metal from the cube, so the cube must have been the original shape, and then parts were cut away to form the sphere. The key here is that the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. That probably means that the sphere is the largest possible sphere that can be made from the cube, so the sphere touches the cube in some way.\n\nBut how exactly does the sphere fit inside the cube? If you imagine a cube and then you remove material from the corners to make a sphere, the sphere must be tangent to the cube's faces or maybe tangent to its edges or corners? Let me think. If the sphere is entirely within the cube, the maximum possible radius would be limited by the cube's dimensions. If the sphere is tangent to the centers of the cube's faces, then the diameter of the sphere would be equal to the edge length of the cube. Wait, that's the case when the sphere is inscribed in the cube. So if the sphere is inscribed in the cube, then the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Therefore, if the radius is 3 inches, the diameter is 6 inches, so the cube would have edges of 6 inches. Then the volume of the cube would be 6³ = 216 cubic inches. But the problem says that the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube. If the sphere is inscribed, it would touch the centers of the cube's faces, but the corners of the cube would be cut away to form the sphere. Wait, but if the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length, then the sphere would extend from one face to the opposite face, so yes, removing the corners of the cube would create the sphere. But is there a different way to fit a sphere inside a cube where the cube is smaller?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because if you want the sphere to fit entirely within the cube, the maximum radius is constrained by the cube's dimensions. However, if you consider that the sphere must touch the cube's edges or corners, maybe there's a different relationship. Let me visualize this. If you have a cube and you want to inscribe a sphere such that the sphere touches the cube's edges, but not the centers of the faces. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed such that its diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the cube? But that would make the sphere larger than the cube, which is impossible. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed such that it touches the cube at the midpoints of the edges? Let me think. If that's the case, then the distance from the center of the cube to the midpoint of an edge would be equal to the radius of the sphere. Let me calculate that distance.\n\nLet me denote the edge length of the cube as 's'. The center of the cube is at (s/2, s/2, s/2). The midpoint of an edge would be at, say, (0, s/2, s/2) if we take an edge along the x-axis from (0,0,0) to (s,0,0). Wait, no, midpoint of that edge would be at (s/2, 0, 0). Wait, but the distance from the center of the cube (s/2, s/2, s/2) to the midpoint of that edge (s/2, 0, 0) is sqrt[(s/2 - s/2)^2 + (0 - s/2)^2 + (0 - s/2)^2] = sqrt[0 + (s²/4) + (s²/4)] = sqrt[s²/2] = s/√2. So if the sphere is touching the midpoints of the edges, then the radius would be s/√2. Therefore, given the radius is 3 inches, s would be 3√2. Then the volume of the cube would be (3√2)³ = 27*(2√2) = 54√2 ≈ 76.36 cubic inches. But is this the case? The problem says that the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube. If the sphere touches the midpoints of the edges, then removing the corners would be necessary. However, if the sphere is inscribed in the cube with diameter equal to the edge length, then the sphere touches the centers of the faces, and removing the corners would also be necessary. So which scenario gives the cube with the shortest possible side lengths?\n\nIf the sphere is inscribed such that it touches the centers of the cube's faces, then the cube has edge length 6 inches. If it's inscribed such that it touches the midpoints of the cube's edges, then the cube has edge length 3√2 ≈ 4.24 inches. If it's inscribed such that it touches the cube's corners, then the diameter would be equal to the space diagonal of the cube. Let me check that case too. The space diagonal of a cube is s√3. If the sphere touches the cube's corners, then the diameter of the sphere would be equal to the space diagonal. Therefore, diameter = 2r = s√3. So with r = 3, s = (2*3)/√3 = 6/√3 = 2√3 ≈ 3.464 inches. So the cube would have an edge length of 2√3 inches. But in this case, the sphere would pass through the cube's corners. But if the sphere is passing through the corners, then you wouldn't have to remove metal from the corners, because the corners are part of the sphere. Wait, but the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube. So if the sphere is passing through the original cube's corners, then those corners are on the sphere, so they wouldn't need to be removed. Therefore, that case is not applicable. Therefore, the sphere must be entirely within the cube, so that the corners of the cube are outside the sphere and need to be removed. Therefore, the sphere must be smaller than the cube's space diagonal.\n\nTherefore, there are different ways to inscribe the sphere inside the cube, depending on what part of the cube the sphere touches. The problem says the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. Therefore, we need to find the minimal cube that can contain the sphere, such that the sphere can be formed by removing metal from the cube's corners. So the minimal cube would be the one where the sphere is as large as possible within the cube. Therefore, the largest possible sphere that can fit inside a cube is the one that is tangent to the centers of the cube's faces. In that case, the cube's edge length is equal to the sphere's diameter. Therefore, if the radius is 3 inches, diameter is 6 inches, so the cube has edge length 6 inches, volume 6³ = 216 in³. However, if you can have a larger sphere in a smaller cube, then maybe the cube can be smaller? But how?\n\nWait, if you have a sphere inside a cube, the maximum radius is limited by the cube's dimensions. For example, if you want the sphere to fit entirely within the cube, the maximum radius is half of the cube's edge length (if it's touching the centers of the faces). If you try to make the sphere larger, it would protrude outside the cube. Therefore, if you want the largest possible sphere from a cube, you need the diameter to be equal to the edge length. Therefore, if the problem says that the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube, then the original cube must have had edge length equal to the sphere's diameter. Therefore, the answer is 6³ = 216. However, the problem says \"the shortest possible side lengths\". So maybe there is a way to have a smaller cube, but then the sphere would have to be smaller? But the sphere is fixed with radius 3 inches. Therefore, if we need to fit a sphere of radius 3 inches inside a cube, what is the minimal cube?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe I was confused earlier. The problem is not about making the largest sphere from a cube, but rather making a sphere of radius 3 inches from a cube with the minimal side length. Therefore, we need to find the smallest cube that can contain a sphere of radius 3 inches. Therefore, the minimal cube would be the one where the sphere touches the cube in such a way that any smaller cube would not be able to contain the sphere. The way to contain the sphere is to have the sphere centered in the cube. The minimal cube would be the one where the sphere touches the cube's faces. Because if the sphere is touching the cube's faces, then the cube cannot be made smaller without cutting into the sphere. Therefore, in that case, the edge length of the cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere. Therefore, edge length is 6 inches, volume is 216 in³. Therefore, the answer is 216. But why did I think earlier about other possibilities?\n\nBecause I was confused about whether the sphere is tangent to the faces, edges, or corners. But if we need to fit the sphere inside the cube, the minimal cube is the one where the sphere touches the cube's faces. If the sphere is only touching the edges or the corners, then you could make the cube smaller while still containing the sphere. Wait, let me think again. Suppose the sphere is only touching the edges of the cube. Then, if we shrink the cube slightly, the sphere would still be inside, right? Because the distance from the center to the face is larger than the distance to the edges. Wait, no. Let me clarify with math. Let me denote the cube with edge length s, centered at the origin. The sphere is also centered at the origin with radius r. For the sphere to be entirely inside the cube, every point on the sphere must satisfy |x| ≤ s/2, |y| ≤ s/2, |z| ≤ s/2. The farthest points from the center on the sphere are along the axes. For example, the point (r, 0, 0) must satisfy r ≤ s/2. Similarly, the point (0, r, 0) and (0, 0, r). Therefore, regardless of direction, the radius must be less than or equal to s/2. Therefore, to contain the sphere, s must be at least 2r. Therefore, the minimal cube has edge length 2r, which is 6 inches. Therefore, the minimal cube has volume 6³ = 216. Therefore, the answer is 216. Therefore, my initial thought was correct.\n\nBut why did I think about other cases? Because I was confused about how exactly the sphere is formed by removing metal from the cube's corners. If the sphere is inscribed in the cube, touching the centers of the faces, then the corners of the cube are outside the sphere and need to be removed. Therefore, that makes sense with the problem statement. Therefore, the answer is 216. But let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. Suppose that instead of the sphere being inscribed in the cube, the cube is circumscribed around the sphere. But that's the same thing. If you have a sphere inside a cube, touching its faces, then the cube is circumscribed around the sphere. Therefore, regardless, the edge length is 2r. Therefore, 6 inches. Therefore, volume 216.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is referring to a different way of fitting the sphere into the cube? For example, if you have a cube and you want to fit a sphere such that the sphere touches all eight corners of the cube. In that case, the space diagonal of the cube would be equal to the diameter of the sphere. Then, space diagonal is s√3 = 2r => s = 2r / √3. For r = 3, s = 6 / √3 = 2√3 ≈ 3.464. But in this case, the sphere is passing through the cube's corners. However, the problem says that the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube. If the sphere passes through the corners, then those corners are part of the sphere, so you wouldn't need to remove them. Therefore, that seems inconsistent with the problem statement. Therefore, this case is invalid. Therefore, the correct case is where the sphere is inscribed in the cube, touching the centers of the faces, requiring the cube's corners to be removed. Therefore, edge length is 6, volume 216.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 216 cubic inches.\n\nBut let me check again. Suppose someone argues that the shortest side length of the cube is such that the sphere is tangent to the edges. Let me calculate that. If the sphere is tangent to the edges, then the distance from the center of the cube to the edge is equal to the radius. The distance from the center to the middle of an edge: as calculated before, it's s/√2. Therefore, if that is equal to the radius, then s = r√2. For r = 3, s = 3√2 ≈ 4.24. But then, in this case, the sphere is tangent to the edges, but the faces of the cube are further away. The distance from the center to the face is s/2 = (3√2)/2 ≈ 2.12 inches. However, the radius of the sphere is 3 inches, which is larger than 2.12. Therefore, this would mean that the sphere would protrude outside the cube, which is impossible. Therefore, my previous calculation was wrong. Wait, if the sphere is tangent to the edges, then the radius would have to be equal to the distance from center to edge, but if that distance is less than the distance from center to face, then the sphere would extend beyond the faces. Which is impossible. Therefore, my mistake earlier was thinking that if you set the radius equal to the distance to the edge, but actually, the sphere can't have a radius larger than the distance to the face. Therefore, this case is impossible. Therefore, the only feasible way is when the sphere is tangent to the faces, making the radius equal to half the edge length. Therefore, confirming that the minimal cube has edge length 6 inches.\n\nTherefore, the volume is 6³ = 216 in³.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose you have a cube, and you want to carve out a sphere from it. The sphere must lie entirely within the cube. Therefore, the maximum radius is half the edge length. Therefore, if you want a sphere of radius 3, you need a cube of edge length 6. Therefore, the answer is 216. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\nBut why does the problem mention \"removing metal from the corners of a cube\"? If the sphere is inscribed, touching the centers of the faces, then the parts to remove are the corners and the parts of the cube's faces beyond the sphere. But maybe there's a different way? For example, if you have a cube and you want to make a sphere by cutting away the corners, maybe the sphere is such that its equator lies along the cube's edges or something? But I don't think so. The standard way to inscribe a sphere in a cube is to have it touch the centers of the faces. Therefore, the answer is 216. Therefore, I think the answer is 216.\n\nBut let me check online if there's a standard problem like this. Wait, I can't actually browse, but I can recall. Yes, the standard volume of the cube required to contain a sphere is such that the cube's edge is equal to the sphere's diameter. Therefore, the volume is diameter cubed. Therefore, for radius 3, diameter 6, volume 6³=216. Therefore, that must be the answer.\n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say the answer is 216 cubic inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe volume of the cube is \\boxed{216} cubic inches.\n</think>"}
