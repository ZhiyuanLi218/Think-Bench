The problem says there are 7 boys and 4 girls in his class, and the order doesn't matter. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since the order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem, right? Combinations are used when we want to select items from a larger set without considering the order. So, I need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7 and 2 girls out of 4, and then multiply those two numbers together to get the total number of possible groups.\n\nLet me recall the formula for combinations. The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items is given by the combination formula:\n\n$$\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n$$\n\nWhere \"n!\" stands for the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n. So, for the boys, we need to calculate C(7, 3) and for the girls, C(4, 2). Then multiply them.\n\nLet me start with the boys. Calculating C(7, 3). Plugging into the formula:\n\n$$\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times 4!}\n$$\n\nHmm, factorials can get big, but maybe we can simplify this before calculating. Let's expand the factorials:\n\n7! is 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, but since we have 4! in the denominator, we can cancel out the 4! in the numerator and denominator. So:\n\n$$\n\\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{3! \\times 4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3!}\n$$\n\n3! is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6. So:\n\n$$\n\\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{6} = 7 \\times 5 = 35\n$$\n\nOh, that's nice. So there are 35 ways to choose the boys.\n\nNow for the girls: C(4, 2). Using the same formula:\n\n$$\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!}\n$$\n\nAgain, expanding the factorials:\n\n4! is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, and the denominator is 2! × 2! = 2 × 1 × 2 × 1 = 4. So:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2!} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n$$\n\nWait, let me check that again. Alternatively, 4! is 24, divided by (2! × 2!) which is 2 × 2 = 4. So 24 / 4 = 6. Yep, that's correct. So there are 6 ways to choose the girls.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls is the product of these two numbers: 35 (for the boys) multiplied by 6 (for the girls).\n\nCalculating that: 35 × 6. Let me do 30 × 6 = 180, and 5 × 6 = 30, so total is 180 + 30 = 210. So 210 ways.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me verify the combination calculations again.\n\nFor the boys: C(7,3). Another way to compute this is 7 choose 3. Let me recall that 7 choose 3 is 35. Yes, that's a standard combinatorial result. For example, 7 choose 3 is calculated as 7×6×5/(3×2×1) = 210 / 6 = 35. Correct.\n\nFor the girls: 4 choose 2. Which is 6. That's also standard. There are 6 ways to choose 2 out of 4. For example, if the girls are A, B, C, D, the pairs are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. That's 6. Correct.\n\nMultiplying them gives 35×6. Let me do that again. 35×6. 30×6=180, 5×6=30, 180+30=210. Yep. So 210 total ways.\n\nIs there another way to think about this problem? Maybe using permutations, but since order doesn't matter, combinations are the right approach. If order mattered, we would have to use permutations and then divide by the number of arrangements, but since the problem states that order doesn't matter, combinations are appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the multiplication principle. For each way of choosing the boys, there are 6 ways to choose the girls. So if there are 35 ways for the boys, each of those can be paired with 6 different girl groups. So total number is indeed 35×6=210.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the answer. Let me check if there's any chance I could have confused combinations with permutations. For example, if I had used permutations for boys and girls, what would happen?\n\nIf I did P(7,3) for boys, that would be 7×6×5=210, and P(4,2)=4×3=12. Then total would be 210×12=2520. But that's if the order of selection matters. However, since the problem says order doesn't matter, we don't want permutations. So combinations are correct here.\n\nAnother check: The number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 is definitely less than 7^3, which is 343. 35 is reasonable. Similarly, choosing 2 girls from 4 is 6, which is less than 4^2=16. So multiplying them gives 210, which seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if I list all possible groups, but obviously that's not practical here. But given that the math checks out with multiple methods, I feel confident.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute the combination values using another formula or a different approach.\n\nFor combinations, another way is to use the property that C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). For example, C(7, 3) = C(7, 4). Let me check that. C(7,4) is 7! / (4! * 3!) which is the same as C(7,3). So 35. Similarly, C(4,2)=C(4,2) which is same as C(4,2). So that doesn't add new info, but confirms that the combinations are symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Pascal's triangle? But that might be too time-consuming here.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For C(7,3), it's equal to C(6,3) + C(6,2). Let me check that. If I know C(6,3) is 20 and C(6,2) is 15, then 20 + 15 = 35. Which matches. So that works. Similarly, C(4,2) = C(3,2) + C(3,1) = 3 + 3 = 6. Correct. So that also confirms the numbers.\n\nTherefore, all methods lead to 35 and 6, so multiplying them gives 210. Therefore, the answer should be 210.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls is \\boxed{210}.\n</think>"}
