The problem gives a series of reactions starting from 2-methylpropan-1-ol (which is also known as isobutyl alcohol) and goes through several steps to form E. Each step produces a different compound (A, B, C, D), and the NMR data for each is provided. My task is to determine the NMR for E based on these reactions and the given data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each reaction step and how the structure changes from one compound to the next. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with 2-methylpropan-1-ol. The structure of this compound is CH2CH(CH3)2-OH. The common name for this is isobutyl alcohol. So the hydroxyl group is on the terminal carbon, and there are two methyl groups on the adjacent carbon.\n\nThe first reaction is oxidation with K2Cr2O4 and H2SO4. That's a strong oxidizing agent. The product A is formed here. The next step is adding LiOH to A to get B. Then, B is reacted with lithium propan-2-ide (which is lithium isopropylide) to form C. Then C is treated with H3O+, H2O, and heat to get D. Finally, D is reacted with dimethylamine and H+ to get E.\n\nLet me start by analyzing each step.\n\nStarting with the oxidation of 2-methylpropan-1-ol. Primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids depending on the conditions. However, in this case, the oxidizing agent is K2Cr2O4 with H2SO4, which is a strong oxidizing condition. Since 2-methylpropan-1-ol is a primary alcohol, but the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2-OH. The primary alcohol here is on a carbon that is attached to two methyl groups. If we oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, but in this case, since the alcohol is on a tertiary carbon? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon with the hydroxyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the carbon with the OH is a primary carbon, but adjacent to a tertiary carbon. Wait, no. Let me draw the structure.\n\nThe molecule is 2-methylpropan-1-ol. The propan-1-ol part is CH2CH2CH2-OH? Wait no. Wait, propan-1-ol is CH2CH2CH2-OH? No, propan-1-ol is CH3CH2CH2OH. But when it's 2-methylpropan-1-ol, that would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2OH? Wait, no. Wait, propan-1-ol is CH3CH2CH2OH. If there's a methyl group on carbon 2, then the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2OH. Wait, but propan-1-ol is three carbons, so carbon 1 is the OH-bearing carbon. So 2-methylpropan-1-ol would be (CH3)2CHCH2OH. Yes, that's correct. So the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2OH. The hydroxyl group is on the terminal carbon (carbon 1), and the adjacent carbon (carbon 2) is a tertiary carbon with two methyl groups.\n\nSo when oxidizing a primary alcohol under strong conditions, like K2Cr2O4 and H2SO4, the product would be a carboxylic acid. However, if the primary alcohol is on a carbon that is adjacent to a tertiary carbon, oxidation might stop at the aldehyde stage? Wait, but in general, under acidic conditions with excess oxidizing agent, primary alcohols are oxidized all the way to carboxylic acids. However, in this case, the primary carbon is (CH2OH) adjacent to a tertiary carbon (CH(CH3)2). So the oxidation of (CH2OH) to COOH would result in (CH(CH3)2COOH. So compound A would be 2-methylpropanoic acid? Wait, but the structure would be (CH3)2CHCOOH. So the name would be 2-methylpropanoic acid, but the correct IUPAC name is 2-methylpropanoic acid. However, the correct IUPAC name for a carboxylic acid with three carbons and a methyl branch on the second carbon would be 2-methylpropanoic acid. Alternatively, since propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, adding a methyl on carbon 2 would make it (CH3)2CHCOOH. So yes, 2-methylpropanoic acid. So A is 2-methylpropanoic acid.\n\nBut let me check the given NMR data for A to see if that makes sense. The NMR data for A is:\n\nA: 1.19 (6H, d), 1.53 (6H, s), 2.33 (1H, sept), 2.72 (6H, s)\n\nSo let's analyze this. If A is 2-methylpropanoic acid, which is (CH3)2CHCOOH. The structure would have two methyl groups on the beta carbon (carbon adjacent to the COOH), and the alpha carbon is CH2COOH? Wait no. Wait, the structure is (CH3)2CHCOOH. So the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon (carbon 1), the next carbon (carbon 2) is CH(CH3)2, and then there's no carbon 3. Wait, no. Wait, the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. The structure is:\n\nCOOH-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, the parent chain for propanoic acid is three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH3. If we have a methyl group on carbon 2 (the middle carbon), then the structure would be COOH-CH(CH3)-CH3. But in this case, the original alcohol was 2-methylpropan-1-ol, which is (CH3)2CHCH2OH. Oxidizing that would give (CH3)2CHCOOH. Wait, that's four carbons? No, the parent chain is three carbons: the COOH is on carbon 1, the next carbon (carbon 2) is CH(CH3)2, and then there is no carbon 3. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, propanoic acid is three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH3. If we have a methyl group on carbon 2, that would be COOH-CH(CH3)-CH3. But that's actually 2-methylpropanoic acid. Wait, but that's the same as isobutyric acid. The structure is (CH3)2CHCOOH. So the structure is:\n\nCOOH-CH(CH3)-CH3. Wait, but that's four carbons? No, the parent chain is three carbons: COOH is carbon 1, then carbon 2 is CH(CH3), and carbon 3 is CH3. Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nCarbon 1: COOH\n\nCarbon 2: CH(CH3)\n\nCarbon 3: CH3?\n\nBut that would be four carbons. Wait, no. The parent chain for propanoic acid is three carbons. If we have a methyl group on carbon 2, then the structure is COOH-CH(CH3)-CH3. But that's actually four carbons total. Wait, no. The propanoic acid has three carbons in the main chain. If we have a methyl branch on carbon 2, then the main chain is still three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH(CH3). Wait, no, that would be carbon 1: COOH, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: CH(CH3). But that would be 2-methylpropanoic acid. Wait, but the correct IUPAC name would be 2-methylpropanoic acid. The structure is CH2(COOH)CH(CH3)2? No, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. The original alcohol is 2-methylpropan-1-ol. The structure is (CH3)2CHCH2OH. So the carbon chain is: carbon 1 (OH), carbon 2 (CH(CH3)2), carbon 3 (CH2OH). Wait, no. Wait, propan-1-ol is CH3CH2CH2OH. Adding a methyl group on carbon 2 would make it (CH3)2CHCH2OH. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\n\nCarbon 2: CH(CH3)\n\nCarbon 3: CH(CH3)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the propan-1-ol is three carbons. Carbon 1 is the OH carbon. Carbon 2 is CH2, and carbon 3 is CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 2, it becomes CH2OH-CH(CH3)-CH3. So the structure is CH2OH-CH(CH3)-CH3. Oxidizing the primary alcohol (CH2OH) to COOH would give COOH-CH(CH3)-CH3. So the structure is (CH3)2CHCOOH. So the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon, and the rest is (CH3)2CH-.\n\nSo the structure of A is (CH3)2CHCOOH. Now, let's analyze the NMR data given for A.\n\nThe NMR data for A is:\n\n1.19 (6H, d), 1.53 (6H, s), 2.33 (1H, sept), 2.72 (6H, s)\n\nLet me see. Let's look at the structure (CH3)2CHCOOH.\n\nThe COOH proton is usually a broad singlet, but in the given data, there's no signal around 10-12 ppm, which is typical for carboxylic acids. However, the given data for A doesn't have such a signal. Wait, but maybe the COOH is not visible in the 1H-NMR? Or perhaps the data is simplified or the solvent is deuterated, so the COOH is not observed. Let's assume that.\n\nNow, the rest of the protons:\n\nThe (CH3)2CH- group. The two methyl groups on the CH are equivalent? Wait, the structure is (CH3)2CHCOOH. So the central carbon is CH(CH3)2. So the two methyl groups are adjacent to the CH. So the two methyl groups (each CH3) are adjacent to the CH. In that case, the two methyl groups are equivalent? No, because they are both on the same carbon. Wait, no. Wait, the central carbon is CH(CH3)2. So there are two methyl groups attached to the same carbon. Those two methyl groups are equivalent? Yes, because they are on the same carbon. So their protons are equivalent. Therefore, the two methyl groups would give a single signal. But the given data for A has 1.19 (6H, d). That would be two equivalent methyl groups (each 3H) giving a total of 6H. The splitting pattern is a doublet. So that suggests that the methyl groups are adjacent to a CH proton that is splitting them. Let's think.\n\nThe central carbon is CH(CH3)2. The CH is adjacent to the COOH group (carbon 1) and the two methyl groups. The CH proton is adjacent to the COOH (carbon 1) and the two methyl groups. The splitting of the methyl protons would depend on the coupling with the adjacent CH proton. If the CH proton is splitting the methyl protons, then each methyl group's protons would be split into a doublet. However, since the two methyl groups are equivalent, their signals would overlap, resulting in a single doublet at 1.19 ppm for 6H. That seems to fit.\n\nThen, there's a signal at 1.53 ppm (6H, s). Wait, where would that come from? The structure (CH3)2CHCOOH doesn't have another 6H group. Wait, unless there's another part of the molecule. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Maybe compound A is not (CH3)2CHCOOH. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal compound is 2-methylpropan-1-ol, which is (CH3)2CHCH2OH. Oxidizing that would give (CH3)2CHCOOH. But maybe the oxidation stops at the aldehyde? Let's think. The oxidation of primary alcohols can be stopped at the aldehyde if using a milder oxidizing agent, but K2Cr2O4 with H2SO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, so it should go to the carboxylic acid. However, if the alcohol is on a carbon that is adjacent to a tertiary carbon, maybe the oxidation is not possible? Wait, no. The primary alcohol can be oxidized regardless of the adjacent carbons. So the product should be the carboxylic acid.\n\nBut then why is there a 6H singlet at 1.53 ppm? Let me check the structure again. Maybe there's another part. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me count the protons.\n\nIn (CH3)2CHCOOH:\n\n- Two methyl groups (each 3H) on the CH: total 6H, which gives a doublet at 1.19 ppm (split by the CH proton).\n- The CH proton (1H) adjacent to COOH and the two methyl groups. The splitting of this proton would depend on the neighboring protons. The CH is adjacent to the COOH (no protons there) and the two methyl groups. So the CH proton would be split by the two methyl groups? Wait, no. The splitting comes from adjacent protons. The CH proton is adjacent to the COOH (no protons) and the two methyl groups (each has 3 protons, but they are on the same carbon). So the CH proton is adjacent to the two methyl groups, which have protons. However, since the two methyl groups are on the same carbon, their protons are adjacent to the CH. Wait, the CH is between the COOH and the two methyl groups. So the CH proton is adjacent to the two methyl groups. Each methyl group has 3 protons, but since they are on the same carbon, they are not adjacent to the CH proton. Wait, no. The CH proton is on the same carbon as the two methyl groups. Wait, the structure is COOH-CH(CH3)2. The CH is the carbon with two methyl groups and a COOH. So the CH proton is on the same carbon as the two methyl groups. Therefore, the CH proton is not adjacent to the methyl protons. Adjacent means next to in the carbon chain. The CH proton is on the same carbon as the methyl protons, so they are geminal protons. Therefore, the splitting would be due to geminal coupling. But geminal coupling is usually small, and if the two methyl groups are equivalent, the splitting might be a triplet? Wait, no. The CH proton is adjacent to the two methyl groups. Wait, the CH is adjacent to the COOH and the two methyl groups. The splitting of the CH proton would be from the neighboring protons. Since the CH is adjacent to the COOH (no protons) and the two methyl groups (each has 3 protons). Wait, but the CH is adjacent to the two methyl groups. Wait, no. The CH is on the same carbon as the methyl groups. So the CH proton is on the same carbon as the methyl groups. Therefore, the CH proton is not adjacent to any protons. Therefore, the CH proton would be a singlet? But the given data for A has a signal at 2.33 ppm (1H, sept). A septet suggests coupling with six protons. Wait, a septet is typically a proton coupled to six equivalent protons, which would be two CH3 groups (each with 3H). So if the CH proton is adjacent to two methyl groups (each 3H), then it would split into a septet. That makes sense. So the CH proton is split into a septet by the two methyl groups. Therefore, the 2.33 ppm signal is the CH proton as a septet. That fits.\n\nThen, the two methyl groups are split by the CH proton into doublets. So the 1.19 ppm (6H, d) is the two methyl groups as a doublet due to coupling with the CH proton. Then, the 2.33 ppm (1H, sept) is the CH proton. Then, the 2.72 ppm (6H, s) is another set of 6H as a singlet. Wait, where are these protons coming from? The structure (CH3)2CHCOOH doesn't have another 6H singlet. Unless there's another part of the molecule. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of A.\n\nWait, maybe the oxidation didn't go to the carboxylic acid. Maybe it stopped at the ketone? But 2-methylpropan-1-ol is a primary alcohol. Oxidation of primary alcohols to ketones is not possible unless it's a secondary alcohol. Since this is a primary alcohol, oxidation would give aldehyde or carboxylic acid. If it's a secondary alcohol, oxidation would give a ketone. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the oxidation is not possible? No, the primary alcohol can be oxidized. Wait, but maybe the structure of A is different. Let me consider the possibility that the oxidation product is a ketone. But that would require the alcohol to be secondary. However, 2-methylpropan-1-ol is primary. Therefore, oxidation should give a carboxylic acid.\n\nBut then why is there a 6H singlet at 2.72 ppm? Let me check again. The structure (CH3)2CHCOOH has:\n\n- Two methyl groups (each 3H) adjacent to CH, giving a doublet at 1.19 ppm (6H).\n- The CH proton (1H) as a septet at 2.33 ppm.\n- The COOH proton (broad singlet, not observed in the data).\n- The remaining protons? There are no other protons in the structure. Unless there's another part. Wait, maybe the oxidation is not to the carboxylic acid but to an aldehyde? Let's consider that. If the oxidation stops at the aldehyde, then the product would be (CH3)2CHCHO. The structure would be (CH3)2CHCHO. Then, the protons would be:\n\n- Two methyl groups (6H) as a doublet (split by the CH proton).\n- The CH proton (1H) as a septet (split by the two methyl groups).\n- The aldehyde proton (1H) as a singlet at around 9-10 ppm. However, the given data for A does not have a signal in that range. Also, the given data for A has a 6H singlet at 2.72 ppm. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another functional group. Wait, maybe the oxidation product is a different compound. Let me think again. The original compound is 2-methylpropan-1-ol. If we oxidize it, we get (CH3)2CHCOOH. But maybe there's another pathway. Wait, perhaps the oxidation is not happening as expected. Alternatively, maybe the given NMR data for A suggests a different structure.\n\nLooking at the NMR data for A:\n\n1.19 (6H, d), 1.53 (6H, s), 2.33 (1H, sept), 2.72 (6H, s)\n\nTotal protons accounted for: 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 19? No, wait, the multiplicities are the number of protons. Wait, each signal is:\n\n- 1.19 ppm: 6H, doublet\n- 1.53 ppm: 6H, singlet\n- 2.33 ppm: 1H, septet\n- 2.72 ppm: 6H, singlet\n\nTotal protons: 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 19? No, wait, no. Each signal's number in parentheses is the number of protons. So total protons would be 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 19? That can't be right. Wait, no. The total number of protons in the molecule should be consistent. Let me check the molecular formula of A.\n\nOriginal compound is 2-methylpropan-1-ol: C4H10O. Oxidation would convert the OH to COOH, so adding an oxygen and removing two hydrogens? Wait, oxidation of RCH2OH to RCOOH involves adding O and removing 2H. So the molecular formula would change from C4H10O to C4H8O2. Let's check the protons in that case. C4H8O2 would have 8 protons. But according to the NMR data given, the total protons would be 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 19? That's impossible. Wait, no. Wait, the numbers in parentheses are the number of protons for each signal. Let me sum them up:\n\n6H (d) + 6H (s) + 1H (sept) + 6H (s) = 19H? That's way too high. There must be a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the numbers in the parentheses are the number of protons for each signal, but the total should be equal to the number of protons in the molecule. Let me check the molecular formula again.\n\nIf A is the oxidation product of 2-methylpropan-1-ol (C4H10O), then oxidation to carboxylic acid would give C4H8O2. The number of protons in C4H8O2 would be 8. However, the given NMR data for A has total protons of 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 19? That's impossible. Clearly, there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe I misread the data. Let me check again.\n\nThe user provided:\n\nA:1.19 (6H, d), 1.53 (6H, s), 2.33 (1H, sept), 2.72 (6H, s)\n\nSo total protons would be 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 19? No, that's not possible. There must be a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the numbers in the parentheses are not the number of protons but the integration? No, in NMR, the numbers in parentheses typically represent the number of protons for each signal. So this suggests that there's an error in the given data or my understanding of the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the given data is for a different compound. Let me try to deduce the structure based on the NMR data for A.\n\nThe signals are:\n\n- 1.19 ppm (6H, d)\n- 1.53 ppm (6H, s)\n- 2.33 ppm (1H, sept)\n- 2.72 ppm (6H, s)\n\nLet me think about possible structures. The 6H singlet at 2.72 ppm is unusual. Maybe it's two equivalent methyl groups attached to an oxygen? Like in a methoxy group (-OCH3). But two methoxy groups would be 6H. However, in that case, the signal would be a singlet. Similarly, maybe there are two methyl groups adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone like (CH3)2CO, the methyl protons would be a singlet. But in that case, the structure would have a ketone.\n\nWait, let's try to piece this together. The 1.53 ppm (6H, s) could be two equivalent methyl groups attached to a carbon that doesn't have any neighboring protons. For example, in a ketone like (CH3)2CO, the methyl protons are a singlet. The 1.19 ppm (6H, d) could be two methyl groups split by a neighboring proton. The 2.33 ppm (1H, sept) is a proton split by six protons, suggesting it's adjacent to two methyl groups. The 2.72 ppm (6H, s) is another set of six protons as a singlet.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the molecule has a central CH group (1H) adjacent to two methyl groups (6H, d), and there are two more methyl groups as singlets. Perhaps the molecule has two ketone groups or two methoxy groups? Let's think.\n\nIf there are two methoxy groups (-OCH3), each would contribute 3H as a singlet. Two of them would be 6H as a singlet. So the 2.72 ppm could be two methoxy groups. The 1.53 ppm (6H, s) could be two methyl groups attached to a carbon with no neighboring protons. For example, in a structure like (CH3)2CO, the methyl protons are a singlet. So if there are two such groups, that would be 6H as singlet. But how would that fit with the rest?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has two ketone groups? For example, a molecule like (CH3)2CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another approach: the 2.33 ppm (1H, sept) suggests a CH proton adjacent to two methyl groups (each 3H), giving a septet. The 1.19 ppm (6H, d) is those two methyl groups as a doublet. The 1.53 ppm (6H, s) could be another two methyl groups as a singlet. The 2.72 ppm (6H, s) could be another two methyl groups as a singlet. So total protons would be 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 19? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe some of these signals are overlapping or there's a mistake in the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2.72 ppm (6H, s) is part of the same group. Let me think of a structure that has these features. For example, a molecule with a central CH group (1H) adjacent to two methyl groups (6H, d), and two methoxy groups (6H, s). The rest of the structure could be a ketone or something else. For example, if the molecule is something like (CH3)2CH-O-CO-O-CH3? No, that seems too complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is a diester? For example, if the oxidation product is a diacid, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe the oxidation is not happening as I thought. Let me consider the possibility that compound A is not a carboxylic acid but something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the oxidation is not of the alcohol but of another functional group. But the starting material is an alcohol, so oxidation should be of the OH group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the given NMR data for A is for a different compound. Let me try to deduce the structure based on the NMR data.\n\nThe 1.19 ppm (6H, d) suggests two equivalent methyl groups adjacent to a CH group (split into doublet by the CH proton).\n\nThe 2.33 ppm (1H, sept) is the CH proton adjacent to two methyl groups (split into septet by the six methyl protons).\n\nThe 1.53 ppm (6H, s) is another set of six protons as a singlet. This could be two methyl groups attached to a carbon with no neighboring protons, like in a ketone (e.g., (CH3)2CO).\n\nThe 2.72 ppm (6H, s) is another set of six protons as a singlet. This could be two methoxy groups (-OCH3).\n\nSo putting this together, the molecule might have a structure like:\n\n(CH3)2CH-O-CO-O-CH3? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound with two ketone groups and two methoxy groups? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the molecule is a ketone with two methoxy groups. For example, (CH3)2CO-OCH3? No, that's a methyl ether of acetone. But the NMR would show the methyl protons of the ketone as a singlet (around 2 ppm) and the methoxy protons as a singlet (around 3.5 ppm). But the given data has signals at 1.19, 1.53, 2.33, and 2.72. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a central CH group (1H) adjacent to two methyl groups (6H, d), and there are two other methyl groups as singlets. Let's imagine the structure is (CH3)2CH-R, where R contains two methyl groups as singlets. For example, if R is -COOCH3, then the molecule would be (CH3)2CH-COOCH3. Let's analyze the NMR of that.\n\nStructure: (CH3)2CH-COOCH3.\n\nThe protons would be:\n\n- Two methyl groups on the CH: 6H, doublet (split by the CH proton).\n- The CH proton: 1H, septet (split by the six methyl protons).\n- The methyl protons of the ester (COOCH3): 3H, singlet.\n- The other protons? The COOH part would have no protons, but in an ester, the COOCH3 has the methyl group. So total protons would be 6 + 1 + 3 = 10H, but the given data has 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 19H. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe there are two ester groups? Like (CH3)2CH-COOCH3 and another ester? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is (CH3)2CH-N+ (CH3)3? No, that would be a quaternary ammonium compound, but the NMR data doesn't suggest that.\n\nWait, perhaps the 6H singlet at 2.72 ppm is due to two methyl groups attached to a nitrogen? Like in a dimethylamino group. For example, if the molecule has a dimethylamino group, the protons would be around 2-3 ppm as a singlet. But that would require the presence of a nitrogen, which isn't in the oxidation product of an alcohol. Unless the oxidation is not happening as expected.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed to the next steps and see if that helps. Let's look at compound B, which is A + LiOH. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with LiOH would be a neutralization to form a lithium salt. However, if A is a carboxylic acid, then B would be its lithium salt. But NMR data for B is given as:\n\nB:0.84 (12H, d), 1.77 (2H, septd), 2.43 (1H, t), 2.44 (6H, s)\n\nTotal protons: 12 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 21? Again, this seems too high. But let's see.\n\nIf B is the lithium salt of the carboxylic acid, the structure would be LiOOC-(CH3)2CH-. The lithium salt might not have any new protons, so the NMR should be similar to A, but without the COOH proton. However, the NMR data for B is different. This suggests that maybe my initial assumption about the structure of A is incorrect.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look at the NMR data for D, which is the final compound before E, and see if that helps. The NMR data for D is:\n\nD:0.97 (3H, t), 1.21 (6H, d), 1.96 (2H, qd), 2.38 (1H, sept), 2.73 (6H, s), 4.79 (1H, t)\n\nLet me analyze this. The signals are:\n\n- 0.97 ppm (3H, t): terminal methyl group, triplet.\n- 1.21 ppm (6H, d): two equivalent methyl groups, doublet.\n- 1.96 ppm (2H, qd): two protons, quartet of doublets or something similar.\n- 2.38 ppm (1H, sept): one proton, septet.\n- 2.73 ppm (6H, s): six protons, singlet.\n- 4.79 ppm (1H, t): one proton, triplet.\n\nLet's try to piece together the structure. The 0.97 ppm (3H, t) suggests a terminal methyl group (CH3) adjacent to a CH2 group. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons (from the adjacent CH2).\n\nThe 1.21 ppm (6H, d) is two equivalent methyl groups as a doublet, suggesting they are adjacent to a CH proton.\n\nThe 1.96 ppm (2H, qd): this could be a CH2 group adjacent to both a CH group and a terminal CH3. A quartet of doublets suggests coupling with two different sets of protons.\n\nThe 2.38 ppm (1H, sept): a CH proton adjacent to two methyl groups (septet).\n\nThe 2.73 ppm (6H, s): six protons as a singlet, likely two methyl groups attached to a carbon with no neighboring protons.\n\nThe 4.79 ppm (1H, t): one proton as a triplet, possibly a CH proton adjacent to two protons (like in a CH group next to a CH2).\n\nPutting this together, let's imagine the structure. Starting from the terminal methyl group (0.97 ppm, 3H, t), which is CH3-CH2-... The next part is a CH2 group (1.96 ppm, 2H, qd). Then, adjacent to that CH2 is a CH group (2.38 ppm, 1H, sept) which is adjacent to two methyl groups (1.21 ppm, 6H, d). So the structure could be CH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2). Wait, no. Let me try to sketch:\n\nThe terminal methyl is CH3-CH2-... The CH2 is adjacent to a CH group (2.38 ppm, sept) which is adjacent to two methyl groups (1.21 ppm, d). So the structure might be CH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2). Wait, but that would give a CH2 adjacent to a CH(CH(CH3)2). Let's see:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2). But that would have a CH2 group (1.96 ppm, qd), a CH group (2.38 ppm, sept), and two methyl groups (1.21 ppm, d). The CH2 group is adjacent to the CH group, so the CH2 protons would be split by the CH proton and the terminal CH3. If the CH2 is adjacent to a CH and a CH3, then the splitting would be a quartet of doublets (qd). That fits the 1.96 ppm (2H, qd).\n\nThen, the CH group (2.38 ppm, sept) is adjacent to two methyl groups (1.21 ppm, d). The septet suggests the CH is adjacent to six protons (two methyl groups), and the methyl groups are split by the CH proton into doublets.\n\nThen, the 2.73 ppm (6H, s) is another set of six protons as a singlet. This could be two methyl groups attached to a carbon with no neighboring protons, like in a ketone or an ether.\n\nFinally, the 4.79 ppm (1H, t) is a proton as a triplet. This could be a proton adjacent to two protons, such as in a CH group next to a CH2. For example, if there's a hydroxyl group or an ether linkage.\n\nPutting this all together, the structure might be something like:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-O-... with the 2.73 ppm singlet being two methyl groups attached to an oxygen. Alternatively, it could be a structure with a hydroxyl group.\n\nBut considering the reaction steps, D is formed from C by treatment with H3O+, H2O, and heat. C is formed from B by reaction with lithium propan-2-ide (lithium isopropylide). B is formed from A by reaction with LiOH. A is the oxidation product of 2-methylpropan-1-ol.\n\nLet me try to work backward. If D has a structure that includes a terminal methyl group (0.97 ppm), a CH2 group (1.96 ppm), a CH group adjacent to two methyl groups (2.38 ppm, sept), and a 6H singlet (2.73 ppm), maybe D is a compound like (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-O-something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the reaction from C to D: C + H3O+, H2O, Heat → D. This is likely an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or a protonation followed by elimination or some rearrangement.\n\nIf C is formed from B by reaction with lithium propan-2-ide (lithium isopropylide), that suggests a substitution reaction where the lithium reagent replaces a leaving group. B is formed from A by reaction with LiOH, which could be a deprotonation or a substitution if A has a leaving group.\n\nBut A is the oxidation product of 2-methylpropan-1-ol, which we initially thought was a carboxylic acid. If A is a carboxylic acid, reacting with LiOH would form its lithium salt. But then reacting with lithium propan-2-ide (lithium isopropylide) would likely result in a substitution if there's a leaving group, but carboxylic acid lithium salts don't typically have leaving groups. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group? If A is a carboxylic acid, and B is its lithium salt, then reacting with lithium isopropylide might form an acyl lithium compound, which upon hydrolysis would give an ester or something else.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look at the NMR data for D and try to deduce its structure, then work backward.\n\nThe NMR data for D includes a 4.79 ppm (1H, t). This is likely a proton adjacent to two protons, such as in a CH group next to a CH2. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. This could be a hydroxyl proton, but hydroxyl protons are usually broad. Alternatively, it could be a proton in a CH group adjacent to a CH2, like in a secondary alcohol or an ether.\n\nThe 0.97 ppm (3H, t) is a terminal methyl group, likely -CH2CH3.\n\nThe 1.21 ppm (6H, d) is two methyl groups as a doublet, adjacent to a CH proton.\n\nThe 1.96 ppm (2H, qd) is a CH2 group adjacent to a CH and a CH3.\n\nThe 2.38 ppm (1H, sept) is a CH proton adjacent to two methyl groups.\n\nThe 2.73 ppm (6H, s) is two methyl groups as a singlet.\n\nPutting this together, let's try to construct the molecule.\n\nStarting from the terminal methyl (CH3-CH2-...), then a CH2 group (1.96 ppm, qd), then a CH group (2.38 ppm, sept) adjacent to two methyl groups (1.21 ppm, d). So the structure could be CH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2). But then where does the 4.79 ppm (1H, t) come from? Maybe there's an oxygen somewhere.\n\nIf there's an oxygen, perhaps the molecule has a hydroxyl group or an ether. The 4.79 ppm triplet could be a proton adjacent to an oxygen, like in a CH-O group. For example, if there's an ether linkage.\n\nLet me try to imagine a structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-O-CH2-... But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering the reaction from C to D involves H3O+ and heat, which could be a hydrolysis or a protonation followed by elimination. If C is a Grignard or organolithium compound, then hydrolysis would give an alcohol or a hydrocarbon.\n\nGiven that D has a terminal methyl group and a 4.79 ppm proton, perhaps D has a hydroxyl group. For example, if D is an alcohol with the structure CH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-OH, but that would give a hydroxyl proton around 1-5 ppm, but the 4.79 ppm is more characteristic of a proton adjacent to an oxygen, like in a methylene group next to an oxygen (e.g., -CH2-O-), which would have protons around 3-4 ppm. But the 4.79 ppm is higher, possibly indicating a proton adjacent to a carbonyl or something else.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let me try to look at the reaction steps again.\n\nStarting from 2-methylpropan-1-ol → A (oxidation) → B (LiOH) → C (lithium propan-2-ide) → D (H3O+, H2O, heat) → E (dimethylamine + H+).\n\nIf I can figure out what E is, maybe I can work backward. The final step is D + dimethylamine + H+ → E. This could be an acylation or alkylation reaction, depending on the functional groups in D.\n\nIf D has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or a halide, it could react with dimethylamine to form an amine. Alternatively, if D is a carboxylic acid or ester, it could form an amide with dimethylamine.\n\nBut without knowing the structure of D, it's hard to say. Let me try to deduce D's structure from its NMR data.\n\nThe key signals in D's NMR are:\n\n- 0.97 ppm (3H, t): terminal methyl group.\n- 1.21 ppm (6H, d): two methyl groups as a doublet.\n- 1.96 ppm (2H, qd): two protons, quartet of doublets.\n- 2.38 ppm (1H, sept): one proton, septet.\n- 2.73 ppm (6H, s): six protons, singlet.\n- 4.79 ppm (1H, t): one proton, triplet.\n\nLet me try to assign these to specific parts of the molecule.\n\nThe terminal methyl (0.97 ppm, 3H, t) is likely -CH2CH3.\n\nThe 1.21 ppm (6H, d) is two methyl groups as a doublet, adjacent to a CH proton. This suggests a structure like -CH(CH3)2.\n\nThe 2.38 ppm (1H, sept) is the CH proton adjacent to the two methyl groups.\n\nThe 1.96 ppm (2H, qd) is a CH2 group adjacent to both the CH group and the terminal CH3. This suggests a structure like -CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n\nThe 2.73 ppm (6H, s) is another set of six protons as a singlet, likely two methyl groups attached to a carbon with no neighboring protons, like in a ketone or an ether.\n\nThe 4.79 ppm (1H, t) is a proton as a triplet, possibly adjacent to two protons, like in a CH group next to a CH2.\n\nPutting this together, the structure could be:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-O-CH2-... but I need to fit all the signals.\n\nWait, the 4.79 ppm (1H, t) could be a proton adjacent to two protons, like in a CH group next to a CH2. If there's an oxygen, perhaps it's in a structure like -CH2-O-CH2-, where the protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen would be around 3-4 ppm. But the 4.79 ppm is higher, suggesting a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group or a double bond.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a hydroxyl group, the proton might be in that region. However, the triplet suggests coupling with two protons.\n\nAnother possibility is that the 4.79 ppm is a proton in a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or aldehyde. For example, in a structure like -CO-CH2-, the CH2 protons would be around 2-3 ppm, but a CH proton next to a carbonyl would be around 2-3 ppm as well. Not matching 4.79 ppm.\n\nWait, 4.79 ppm is quite high for a proton in an organic molecule. Typical protons adjacent to oxygen are around 3-4 ppm, and those adjacent to carbonyl are around 2-3 ppm. A proton at 4.79 ppm could be a proton in a CH group adjacent to an ether oxygen, or maybe a proton in a CH group adjacent to a double bond (like in an alkene). For example, in a structure like -CH2-CH2-O-, the protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen would be around 3.5 ppm. If there's a double bond, like -CH2-CH=, the proton might be around 5 ppm. But the triplet suggests coupling with two protons, which could be from a CH2 group.\n\nLet me try to imagine a structure where there's a CH group next to a CH2, with the CH at 4.79 ppm. For example, if there's a hydroxyl group, like -CH(OH)-CH2-, but the hydroxyl proton would be broad. Alternatively, if it's a proton in a CH group adjacent to an ether oxygen, like -CH(OCH3)-CH2-.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Let me try to piece together the structure step by step.\n\nStarting with the terminal methyl group (0.97 ppm, 3H, t): -CH2CH3.\n\nNext, the CH2 group at 1.96 ppm (2H, qd): this is adjacent to the terminal CH2CH3 and another group. The qd suggests coupling with both the terminal CH3 and another group. If the CH2 is between the terminal CH3 and a CH group, then the splitting would be a quartet from the terminal CH3 and a doublet from the CH group, resulting in a quartet of doublets (qd). So the structure could be -CH2CH2-CH-... but no, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group.\n\nWait, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group (2.38 ppm, sept) and the terminal CH3. So the structure is -CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2).\n\nNow, the CH group (2.38 ppm, sept) is adjacent to two methyl groups (1.21 ppm, d), giving the septet. So the structure is -CH(CH(CH3)2).\n\nPutting this together: the molecule has a part -CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2).\n\nThen, there's the 2.73 ppm (6H, s) which is two methyl groups as a singlet. This could be attached to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.\n\nFinally, the 4.79 ppm (1H, t) is a proton as a triplet. This could be a proton in a CH group adjacent to a CH2, like in -CH-CH2-.\n\nIf we combine all these parts, the structure might look like:\n\nCH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-O-CH2-...\n\nBut where does the 4.79 ppm proton come from? If there's an oxygen, maybe the structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-O-CH2-CH3. Let's analyze the NMR of this.\n\nStructure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-O-CH2-CH3.\n\nProtons:\n\n- Terminal methyl (CH2CH3): 0.87 ppm (3H, t).\n- The CH2 adjacent to the oxygen: around 3.5 ppm (2H, q).\n- The CH(CH(CH3)2): 2.38 ppm (1H, sept).\n- The two methyl groups on the CH: 1.21 ppm (6H, d).\n- The CH2 between the terminal CH2CH3 and the CH group: 1.96 ppm (2H, qd).\n- The methyl groups attached to the oxygen: 3.5 ppm (3H, s)? No, in this structure, the oxygen is attached to a CH2, not to methyl groups. The 2.73 ppm (6H, s) would need to be two methyl groups attached to something. Maybe there's another part of the molecule.\n\nThis is not fitting. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the 2.73 ppm (6H, s) is two methyl groups attached to a carbon with no neighboring protons, like in a ketone. For example, if the molecule has a (CH3)2CO group, the methyl protons would be a singlet around 2 ppm. But the given data has it at 2.73 ppm, which is higher, suggesting it might be adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.\n\nIf the molecule has two methyl groups attached to an oxygen, like in a dimethyl ether, the protons would be around 3.5 ppm. But the given data has it at 2.73 ppm, which is lower, suggesting less deshielding.\n\nMaybe the 2.73 ppm (6H, s) is two methyl groups attached to a carbon that is adjacent to a double bond or something else, but not an electronegative atom.\n\nThis is very challenging without more information. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should make an educated guess based on the reaction steps and the NMR data.\n\nAssuming that A is 2-methylpropanoic acid, B is its lithium salt, C is the product of a Grignard reaction, D is an alcohol or ether, and E is an amine or amide.\n\nGiven that the final step is D + dimethylamine + H+ → E, it's likely that E is an amine derivative. If D is an alkyl halide or tosylate, it could react with dimethylamine to form an N,N-dimethylalkylamine.\n\nLooking at the NMR data for D, which includes a terminal methyl group and various other protons, if D is an alkyl halide, then E would be the corresponding amine.\n\nBut without knowing D's exact structure, it's hard to determine E's NMR.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each reaction step modifies the molecule in a specific way, and by analyzing the given NMR data for each compound, we can deduce the structure of E.\n\nStarting with A: oxidation of 2-methylpropan-1-ol gives 2-methylpropanoic acid, which has the NMR data provided. Then B is the lithium salt of this acid. C is formed by reaction with lithium propan-2-ide, which is a strong base and nucleophile. This could be a nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group, forming an acyl lithium compound. D is formed by hydrolysis of C, which might give an ester or an alcohol. Finally, E is formed by reaction with dimethylamine, likely forming an amide or amine.\n\nGiven the NMR data for D includes a 4.79 ppm proton, which could be a proton adjacent to an oxygen, like in a hydroxyl group or an ether. If D is an ester, then reacting with dimethylamine would give an amide.\n\nHowever, without the exact structure of D, it's difficult to proceed. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the given NMR data for E.\n\nAssuming that E is an N,N-dimethylamine derivative of D, and considering the NMR data for D, the theoretical 1H-NMR data for E would involve the protons from D plus those from the dimethylamino group.\n\nBut since I don't have the exact structure of D, I'll have to infer based on the reaction steps and the given data.\n\nIf D is an ester, then E would be the corresponding amide. The NMR of an amide would have a proton from the NH group (broad), but in the given data for E, it's not specified. However, the problem asks for the theoretical 1H-NMR data for E, which should be based on the structure derived from the reactions.\n\nGiven the complexity and time constraints, I'll conclude that the correct approach involves tracing each reaction step and using the provided NMR data for each compound to deduce E's structure, but without further information, I can't provide the exact answer. However, based on the given data for D and the final reaction with dimethylamine, the NMR of E would likely include the protons from D plus those from the dimethylamino group, with appropriate shifts and multiplicities.\n</think>"}
