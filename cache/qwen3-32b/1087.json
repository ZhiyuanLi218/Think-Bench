{"question":"Question: The vague statement that smog weather results in excessive content of various suspended particulates in the atmosphere is a result of the interaction between specific climatic conditions and human activities. In the smog, various suspended particulates have irregular shapes, but can be regarded as spheres with the same density and different diameters, and are represented by PM10 and PM2.5 to indicate particulates with diameters less than or equal to $10 \\mu m$, $2.5 \\mu m$ respectively (PM is the abbreviation for particulate matter in English).\n\nA research institution's test results in the Beijing area indicate that during stable smog weather, within a range of hundreds of meters near the ground, the concentration of PM10 slightly decreases with increasing height, and the concentration of large suspended particulates larger than PM10 significantly decreases with increasing height, and the distribution of both concentrations basically does not change over time.

The question is about smog and particulate matter, specifically PM10 and PM2.5. Let me start by recalling what I know from the given information.\n\nFirst, the passage says that PM10 and PM2.5 are particulates with diameters less than or equal to 10 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers, respectively. The options need to be checked against this definition.\n\nOption A says PM10 is 1.0 × 10^-6 meters. Wait, 1 micrometer is 1 × 10^-6 meters. But PM10 is 10 micrometers, right? So 10 micrometers would be 10 × 10^-6 meters, which is 1 × 10^-5 meters. So Option A is saying PM10 is 1 micrometer, which is wrong. Therefore, A is incorrect. So A is out.\n\nOption B: The resultant force of air molecular action on PM10 is always greater than the gravitational force it receives. Hmm. If the resultant force is greater than gravity, then the particles would be moving upwards or staying suspended? But the passage mentions that during stable smog weather, PM10 concentration slightly decreases with height, and larger particles decrease more. So if the particles are settling, maybe the gravitational force is significant. But Brownian motion might be more for smaller particles. Wait, PM10 is 10 micrometers, which is relatively large. So maybe their gravitational force is significant compared to air molecular forces. So if the resultant air force (like buoyancy or something else?) is less than gravity, they would settle. But the question is about the resultant force from air molecules. I'm not sure. Maybe for larger particles, gravity overcomes the air movement forces. So if the concentration decreases with height, maybe they are settling due to gravity. So if the resultant force from air is less than gravity, then B is wrong. But the option says \"always greater\". Maybe for PM10, the air forces are not always greater. So B could be incorrect. Need to think more.\n\nOption C: Both PM10 and large suspended particulates perform Brownian motion. Brownian motion is the random movement of particles due to collisions with air molecules. But Brownian motion is more significant for smaller particles. For larger particles, their movement is more influenced by gravity and air currents. The passage says that large suspended particulates larger than PM10 decrease significantly with height. So maybe they are settling due to gravity rather than Brownian motion. However, do all suspended particles perform Brownian motion? Even larger ones? I think all particles undergo Brownian motion, but it's more noticeable for smaller ones. So even PM10 and larger particles would have some Brownian motion, but maybe it's not the dominant factor for their movement. So the statement in C says \"perform Brownian motion\", which is true in general. So C might be correct. Let me check other options.\n\nOption D: The concentration of PM2.5 gradually increases with height. The passage says that PM10 concentration slightly decreases with height, and larger than PM10 decreases significantly. What about PM2.5? The passage doesn't mention PM2.5 specifically. But PM2.5 is smaller than PM10. Since PM10 decreases slightly with height, maybe PM2.5, being smaller, is affected less by gravity and might stay suspended better. So perhaps their concentration doesn't decrease with height as much, or maybe even increases? But the passage says that the distribution of both PM10 and larger than PM10 doesn't change over time. However, the question is about PM2.5. If PM2.5 is smaller, maybe they are more likely to be carried by air currents or have more Brownian motion, so their distribution might be more uniform or even increase with height. But the passage doesn't directly say. The given data is about PM10 and larger. So maybe we have to infer. Since larger particles decrease more with height, and PM10 decreases slightly, then PM2.5, being smaller, might not decrease as much. However, the question is whether they increase. If the concentration of PM10 decreases with height, maybe PM2.5 does too, but less so. But the option D says PM2.5 increases. The passage doesn't state that. So D might not be correct. Unless there's some reason to think that smaller particles are more concentrated at higher altitudes. But the passage doesn't mention that, so we can't assume that. Therefore, D is not necessarily correct.\n\nSo back to C. The question is whether both PM10 and larger particles perform Brownian motion. Since Brownian motion occurs for all particles, but is more significant for smaller ones. The statement says \"perform Brownian motion\", which is true regardless of size, though the effect is less noticeable for larger particles. Therefore, option C is correct. \n\nOption B: If the resultant force from air is greater than gravity, then the particles would be moving upwards. However, since the concentration of PM10 decreases with height, that suggests that the particles are settling, which would mean gravity is dominant. So the resultant force from air (maybe upward) is less than gravity. Therefore, option B is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
