Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, the problem says that 0.25 moles of a weak, monoprotic acid is dissolved in 0.25 liters of water. The pH is measured as 4.26. So, I need to relate the pH to the pKa. \n\nSince it's a weak monoprotic acid, let's call it HA. When it dissolves in water, it partially dissociates into H+ and A- ions. The dissociation equation is HA ⇌ H+ + A-. \n\nThe first step is probably to find the concentration of the acid. Since moles are 0.25 and volume is 0.25 L, the concentration [HA]initial is 0.25 mol / 0.25 L = 1.0 M. So the initial concentration is 1.0 M.\n\nNow, the pH is given as 4.26. The pH is related to the concentration of H+ ions. The formula is pH = -log[H+]. So if I rearrange that, [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-4.26). Let me calculate that. \n\nLet me remember that 10^(-4) is 0.0001 and 10^(-5) is 0.00001. Since 4.26 is between 4 and 5, the [H+] should be between 10^-4 and 10^-5. To get a more precise value, maybe I can calculate it. \n\nAlternatively, I can just keep it as 10^-4.26 for now. \n\nNow, since the acid is monoprotic and weak, we can assume that the concentration of H+ ions is approximately equal to the square root of (Ka * [HA]initial), but wait, that's the approximation for weak acids where the dissociation is small. However, if the concentration of H+ is not negligible compared to the initial concentration, maybe that approximation isn't valid. Let me check.\n\nThe initial concentration is 1.0 M. If [H+] is 10^-4.26, which is roughly 5.5 x 10^-5 M (since 10^-4.26 ≈ 10^(-4.25 - 0.01) ≈ 5.6 x 10^-5). So 5.5 x 10^-5 is much smaller than 1.0 M. Therefore, the approximation that the dissociation is small is valid. So we can use the formula:\n\n[H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka * [HA]initial)\n\nTherefore, Ka ≈ [H+]^2 / [HA]initial\n\nThen once we have Ka, pKa is -log(Ka). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the exact expression. Let me write the equilibrium expressions.\n\nLet me denote the initial concentration of HA as C = 1.0 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of H+ is x, which is equal to the concentration of A-. The concentration of HA is then C - x. \n\nSo, Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] = x^2 / (C - x)\n\nBut since x is small compared to C, we can approximate C - x ≈ C. Therefore, Ka ≈ x^2 / C. \n\nSo, if I calculate x from the pH, then plug into this equation. \n\nSo x is [H+] = 10^-4.26. Let me calculate that value numerically. \n\nFirst, let me compute 10^-4.26. Let me recall that 10^-4.26 = 10^(-4 - 0.26) = 10^-4 * 10^-0.26. \n\nI know that 10^-0.26 can be calculated. Let me remember that log(0.55) is about -0.26. Wait, log(0.55) ≈ -0.26 because 10^(-0.26) ≈ 0.55. So 10^-0.26 ≈ 0.55. Therefore, [H+] ≈ 0.55 * 10^-4 = 5.5 x 10^-5 M. \n\nTherefore, x ≈ 5.5 x 10^-5. \n\nSo, plugging into Ka ≈ x² / C:\n\nKa ≈ (5.5e-5)^2 / 1.0 = (3.025e-9) / 1.0 ≈ 3.025 x 10^-9. \n\nThen pKa is -log(3.025e-9). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, log(3.025e-9) = log(3.025) + log(1e-9) ≈ 0.481 - 9 = -8.519. Therefore, pKa ≈ 8.519. \n\nWait, but the answer choices are A:4.26, B:8.52, C:7.52, D:3.66. So B is 8.52. But wait, that would suggest that the pKa is 8.52. But the pH is 4.26. But wait, if the pKa is 8.52, that would mean that the solution is more acidic than the pKa, so the acid is mostly undissociated. But wait, the pH is lower than the pKa? Wait, if the pH is lower than pKa, then the acid is more dissociated? Wait, no. Wait, when pH < pKa, the acid is mostly in the protonated form (HA), and when pH > pKa, it's deprotonated (A-). But how does that relate here?\n\nWait, but in this case, the pH is 4.26, and if the pKa is 8.52, then the pH is much lower than pKa. That would mean that the solution is more acidic than the pKa, so the acid is mostly in the protonated form. But since it's a weak acid, even if it's mostly protonated, the [H+] comes from the small amount that dissociates. But according to our calculation, the pKa is 8.52. However, the answer B is 8.52. But let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem. Maybe I made an error in the assumption. Let me check again.\n\nWe have a weak acid HA with initial concentration C = 1.0 M. It dissociates as HA ⇌ H+ + A-. At equilibrium, [H+] = x, [A-] = x, [HA] = C - x. \n\nKa = x² / (C - x). \n\nIf x is small compared to C, then C - x ≈ C. Therefore, Ka ≈ x² / C. \n\nBut in this case, x is 5.5e-5, which is indeed much smaller than 1.0 M. So the approximation holds. Therefore, Ka ≈ (5.5e-5)^2 / 1.0 ≈ 3.0e-9, so pKa ≈ 8.5. So answer B. \n\nBut why is the pH lower than pKa? Well, because the solution is not at the half-equivalence point. The pH equals pKa when [A-] = [HA], which is at half-equivalence. In this case, since the concentration of the acid is high (1.0 M), and the acid is weak, the pH is lower than the pKa. For example, if you have a 1.0 M solution of acetic acid (which has pKa ~4.76), the pH would be around 2.4, which is lower than the pKa. Similarly here, if the pKa is 8.5, then a 1.0 M solution would have a pH lower than that. So that seems plausible. \n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using the exact equation. Let's try without the approximation. \n\nKa = x² / (C - x). \n\nWe have x = [H+] = 5.5e-5. \n\nSo, let's compute Ka exactly. \n\nKa = (5.5e-5)^2 / (1.0 - 5.5e-5). \n\nSince 5.5e-5 is 0.000055, which is negligible compared to 1.0, so denominator is approximately 1.0. Therefore, the exact value would be almost the same as the approximate. Therefore, the pKa is indeed approximately 8.5. \n\nBut wait, the answer options include B:8.52, which is very close. So that would be the answer. But let me check if there's a mistake in my calculation. \n\nWait, let me recalculate [H+]. The pH is 4.26. So [H+] = 10^-4.26. Let me calculate this more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator: 10^-4.26. \n\nFirst, 4.26 can be written as 4 + 0.26. \n\nSo 10^-4.26 = 10^-4 * 10^-0.26. \n\nCalculating 10^-0.26. Let me use natural logarithm? Or remember that log(0.55) is approximately -0.26? Let me check. \n\nlog(0.5) = -0.3010, log(0.55) ≈ ?\n\nLet me recall that log(0.55) = log(5.5 x 10^-1) = log(5.5) + log(10^-1) = log(5.5) - 1. \n\nlog(5.5) ≈ 0.7404 (since log(5)=0.69897, log(6)=0.7782, 5.5 is halfway? Not exactly, but maybe around 0.74). Let me check with more precision. \n\nUsing logarithm properties: log(5.5) = log(11/2) = log(11) - log(2) ≈ 1.0414 - 0.3010 = 0.7404. Yes. So log(0.55) = 0.7404 - 1 = -0.2596 ≈ -0.26. Therefore, 10^-0.26 ≈ 0.55. Therefore, [H+] ≈ 0.55 x 10^-4 = 5.5 x 10^-5. \n\nTherefore, [H+] = 5.5 x 10^-5. \n\nSo, squaring that: (5.5 x 10^-5)^2 = 30.25 x 10^-10 = 3.025 x 10^-9. \n\nTherefore, Ka ≈ 3.025 x 10^-9. \n\nThen pKa = -log(3.025 x 10^-9) ≈ 8.519. \n\nSo, pKa ≈ 8.52, which is answer B. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another approach where maybe the answer is different. For example, maybe the assumption that [H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka*C) is invalid? Let's check. \n\nIf we use the exact expression: \n\nKa = x² / (C - x). \n\nLet me plug in numbers. \n\nx = 5.5e-5, C = 1.0. \n\nSo, denominator is 1.0 - 5.5e-5 ≈ 0.999945. \n\nTherefore, Ka ≈ (5.5e-5)^2 / 0.999945 ≈ 3.025e-9 / 0.999945 ≈ 3.025e-9. \n\nSo, the exact value is almost the same as the approximate. Therefore, the pKa is indeed approximately 8.52. \n\nBut wait, another thought. The question says it's a monoprotic acid. So, there's no other sources of H+ ions except from the dissociation of HA. Also, water autoionization is negligible here because the pH is 4.26, which is much lower than 7, so the H+ from water is negligible. \n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct. \n\nBut let me check another way. Suppose the pKa was 4.26, answer A. Then, what would be the pH? \n\nIf pKa = 4.26, then Ka = 10^-4.26 ≈ 5.5e-5. \n\nThen, for a solution of a weak acid with concentration C = 1.0 M, the pH would be... \n\nUsing the formula [H+] = sqrt(Ka*C) = sqrt(5.5e-5 * 1.0) ≈ sqrt(5.5e-5) ≈ 7.4e-3 M. \n\nThen pH = -log(7.4e-3) ≈ 2.13. But the measured pH is 4.26, which is much higher (less acidic). Therefore, pKa cannot be 4.26. So answer A is incorrect. \n\nIf pKa was 3.66 (answer D), then Ka = 10^-3.66 ≈ 2.19 x 10^-4. Then [H+] = sqrt(2.19e-4 * 1.0) ≈ sqrt(2.19e-4) ≈ 0.0148 M. pH ≈ 1.83, still much lower than 4.26. \n\nIf pKa was 7.52 (answer C), then Ka = 10^-7.52 ≈ 3.0e-8. Then [H+] = sqrt(3.0e-8 * 1.0) ≈ 5.48e-4 M. pH ≈ 3.26, which is still lower than 4.26. \n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, pKa is 8.52. Let's check that. If pKa is 8.52, then Ka = 10^-8.52 ≈ 3.0e-9. Then [H+] = sqrt(3.0e-9 * 1.0) ≈ sqrt(3.0e-9) ≈ 5.48e-5 M, which gives pH ≈ 4.26. Exactly the measured pH. Therefore, this confirms that pKa is 8.52. \n\nTherefore, answer B is correct. \n\nBut why does the pH equal to the pKa? Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the pH equals -log(sqrt(Ka*C)). If the pKa is 8.52, then Ka is 3.0e-9. For a concentration of 1.0 M, the pH is -log(sqrt(3.0e-9 * 1.0)) ≈ -log(5.48e-5) ≈ 4.26. So the pH is not equal to the pKa. The pH is lower than pKa, which makes sense because the solution is more acidic than the pKa. \n\nTherefore, answer B is correct. \n\nI think my reasoning is solid here. The key was recognizing that the pH is determined by the square root of (Ka*C), which leads to pKa being twice the pH minus something? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nActually, if we have [H+] = sqrt(Ka*C), then squaring both sides gives [H+]^2 = Ka*C. Then, Ka = [H+]^2 / C. Taking -log of both sides: \n\npKa = -log([H+]^2 / C) = -log([H+]^2) + log(C) = -2 log[H+] + log(C). \n\nSince pH = -log[H+], so pKa = 2 pH - log(C). \n\nLet me check that formula. \n\nYes, because:\n\npKa = -log(Ka) \n\nKa = [H+]^2 / C \n\nTherefore, \n\npKa = -log([H+]^2 / C) = -log([H+]^2) + log(C) = -2 log[H+] + log(C) \n\nBut pH = -log[H+], so log[H+] = -pH. \n\nTherefore, pKa = -2*(-pH) + log(C) = 2 pH + log(C). \n\nWait, hold on. Let me redo that. \n\npKa = -log(Ka) \n\nKa = [H+]² / C \n\nSo, pKa = -log([H+]² / C) = -log([H+]²) + log(C) \n\n= -2 log[H+] + log(C) \n\nBut since pH = -log[H+], then log[H+] = -pH \n\nTherefore, pKa = -2*(-pH) + log(C) = 2 pH + log(C) \n\nWait, so pKa = 2 pH + log(C). \n\nBut in our case, C is 1.0 M, so log(1.0) = 0. Therefore, pKa = 2 pH. \n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave pKa ≈ 8.52 and pH is 4.26. 2 * 4.26 is 8.52. So that's exactly the case. Therefore, the formula pKa = 2 pH when C = 1.0 M. \n\nThat's a useful formula to remember. So in this case, since the concentration is 1.0 M, pKa is exactly twice the pH. Hence, 2 * 4.26 = 8.52. \n\nTherefore, answer B is correct. \n\nThis formula is valid when the approximation [H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka*C) holds, which is when the dissociation is small. Which in this case it is, since [H+] is 5.5e-5, which is much less than 1.0 M. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B:8.52.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
