The problem says Earth's mass is about 10 times that of Mars, and Earth's radius is about 2 times that of Mars. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me start by recalling what I know about orbital motion.\n\nFirst, I remember that the orbital speed of a satellite or spacecraft around a planet can be calculated using the formula for circular orbital velocity. The formula is v equals the square root of (G times the mass of the planet divided by the radius of the orbit). So, mathematically, that's v = √(G*M/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is the radius of the orbit. Since the spacecraft is orbiting near the surface, I can assume that the orbital radius R is approximately equal to the radius of Mars itself. So, I need to find Mars' mass and radius relative to Earth's, then plug those into the formula.\n\nThe problem states that Earth's mass is 10 times that of Mars. Let me write that down: M_Earth = 10 * M_Mars. Similarly, Earth's radius is 2 times that of Mars: R_Earth = 2 * R_Mars. So if I can express Mars' mass and radius in terms of Earth's, I can use known values for Earth to find the orbital speed.\n\nBut wait, I don't remember the exact values of Earth's mass and radius off the top of my head. However, I do remember Earth's orbital velocity near its surface, which is the escape velocity or the orbital speed? Wait, no, the orbital speed for low Earth orbit is about 7.9 km/s. Let me confirm that. Yes, the first cosmic velocity for Earth is approximately 7.9 km/s. That's the speed required to orbit just above the atmosphere. So maybe I can use this known value to find the orbital speed for Mars?\n\nSince I have ratios between Earth and Mars, perhaps I can set up a ratio of the orbital speeds. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote v_Mars as the orbital speed near Mars' surface, and v_Earth as the same for Earth. Then:\n\nv_Earth = √(G*M_Earth / R_Earth)\n\nv_Mars = √(G*M_Mars / R_Mars)\n\nSo, if I take the ratio v_Mars / v_Earth, that would be:\n\n√( (G*M_Mars / R_Mars) / (G*M_Earth / R_Earth) ) )\n\nSimplify that. The G cancels out. So:\n\n√( (M_Mars / R_Mars) / (M_Earth / R_Earth) ) )\n\nWhich is √( (M_Mars / M_Earth) * (R_Earth / R_Mars) )\n\nGiven that M_Earth = 10*M_Mars, so M_Mars / M_Earth = 1/10. And R_Earth = 2*R_Mars, so R_Earth / R_Mars = 2. Therefore:\n\n√( (1/10) * 2 ) = √(1/5) ≈ √0.2 ≈ 0.447.\n\nTherefore, v_Mars ≈ 0.447 * v_Earth.\n\nSince v_Earth is approximately 7.9 km/s, multiplying that by 0.447 gives:\n\n7.9 * 0.447 ≈ Let me calculate that. 7.9 * 0.4 is 3.16, and 7.9 * 0.047 is approximately 0.371. Adding them together gives about 3.16 + 0.371 ≈ 3.53 km/s. So approximately 3.5 km/s. Looking at the options, option A is 3.5 km/s. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the formula for orbital velocity is correct? Yes, for a circular orbit, the orbital velocity is sqrt(GM/R). So that part is right. Then setting up the ratio, yes. Then substituting the given ratios. Since Earth's mass is 10 times Mars, so Mars mass is 1/10 Earth's. Earth's radius is twice Mars', so Mars radius is half Earth's. Therefore, substituting into the ratio:\n\nv_Mars / v_Earth = sqrt( (M_Mars / M_Earth) * (R_Earth / R_Mars) )\n\nWhich is sqrt( (1/10) * (2 / 1) ) because R_Earth / R_Mars is 2. So sqrt(2/10) = sqrt(1/5) ≈ 0.447. Then multiplying by Earth's orbital speed of ~7.9 km/s gives approx 3.5 km/s. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using actual numbers. Let me try that. Let me recall the gravitational constant G is 6.674×10^-11 N(m/kg)^2. But maybe I don't need to go into that. Alternatively, I can use Earth's values. Let me recall that for Earth, the acceleration due to gravity at the surface is g = 9.81 m/s², and that is equal to GM_Earth / R_Earth². Similarly, for Mars, the acceleration due to gravity at the surface would be g_Mars = GM_Mars / R_Mars². Then the orbital velocity is sqrt(g * R), because if you set the centripetal acceleration equal to gravity: v²/R = g, so v = sqrt(gR). Wait, is that right?\n\nYes! Because for orbital motion, the gravitational acceleration provides the centripetal acceleration. So:\n\nv² / R = GM / R² => v² = GM / R => v = sqrt(GM/R). Alternatively, since g = GM / R², then GM = g R². Substituting into the orbital velocity formula gives v = sqrt( g R² / R ) = sqrt( g R ). Therefore, v = sqrt(g * R). That's another way to write it. So if I can find g for Mars and its radius, I can compute the orbital speed.\n\nBut how does that relate to Earth's values? Let me see. Let me compute g_Mars in terms of Earth's gravity. Since g = GM / R². So for Mars:\n\ng_Mars = G M_Mars / R_Mars²\n\nSimilarly, for Earth:\n\ng_Earth = G M_Earth / R_Earth²\n\nSo taking the ratio:\n\ng_Mars / g_Earth = (M_Mars / M_Earth) * (R_Earth / R_Mars)²\n\nWe know M_Mars / M_Earth = 1/10, and R_Earth / R_Mars = 2. Therefore:\n\ng_Mars / g_Earth = (1/10) * (2)² = (1/10)*4 = 2/5 = 0.4. Therefore, g_Mars is 0.4 times g_Earth. Since g_Earth is 9.81 m/s², then g_Mars is 0.4 * 9.81 ≈ 3.924 m/s². Let me check real value of Mars' gravity. Wait, actually, I remember that the gravity on Mars is about 3.7 m/s², so this approximation is close. Given that the problem gives approximate ratios (Earth's mass is \"about\" 10 times, radius \"about\" 2 times), so 0.4 * 9.8 is about 3.9, which is close to the real value. So that seems okay.\n\nNow, using the formula v = sqrt(g * R). For Mars, we need to calculate sqrt(g_Mars * R_Mars). But how does that relate to Earth's?\n\nAlternatively, let's express R_Mars in terms of Earth's radius. Since R_Earth = 2 R_Mars => R_Mars = R_Earth / 2.\n\nSo, substituting into v_Mars:\n\nv_Mars = sqrt( g_Mars * R_Mars ) = sqrt( (0.4 * g_Earth) * (R_Earth / 2) ) = sqrt( 0.4 / 2 * g_Earth * R_Earth ) = sqrt( 0.2 * g_Earth * R_Earth )\n\nBut for Earth, the orbital velocity is v_Earth = sqrt( g_Earth * R_Earth ). Therefore, v_Mars = sqrt(0.2) * v_Earth ≈ 0.447 * v_Earth, which is the same result as before. Therefore, same conclusion. So if v_Earth is 7.9 km/s, then 0.447 * 7.9 ≈ 3.5 km/s. Therefore, answer A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the numerical value using Earth's numbers. Let me recall that for Earth, the first cosmic velocity is approximately 7.9 km/s. Let me confirm the exact value. The actual value is about 7.9 km/s, yes. So multiplying by 0.447 gives roughly 3.5 km/s. Let me check with more precise numbers. Let's take 7.9 * 0.447. Let me compute 7.9 * 0.4 = 3.16, 7.9 * 0.047 = approx 7.9 * 0.05 = 0.395 minus 7.9 * 0.003 = 0.0237, so 0.395 - 0.0237 = 0.3713. Therefore total is 3.16 + 0.3713 ≈ 3.5313 km/s. So approx 3.5 km/s. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's suppose I use the actual formula with actual numbers. Let's take Earth's mass as 5.972 × 10^24 kg. Then Mars' mass would be about 1/10 of that, so approx 5.972 × 10^23 kg. Earth's radius is about 6,371 km, so Mars' radius is about half of that, which is approx 3,185.5 km. Let me plug these into the orbital velocity formula.\n\nv = sqrt( G*M / R )\n\nFor Mars:\n\nG = 6.674×10^-11 N(m/kg)^2\n\nM = 5.972 × 10^23 kg\n\nR = 3,185,500 meters (since 3,185.5 km)\n\nCalculating G*M:\n\n6.674×10^-11 * 5.972×10^23 ≈ Let me compute that. 6.674 * 5.972 ≈ approx 6.674 * 6 = 40.044 minus 6.674 * 0.028 ≈ 0.187. So approx 40.044 - 0.187 ≈ 39.857. Therefore, approx 3.9857 × 10^13 m³/s²? Wait, units? Well, G*M has units of m³/s².\n\nThen divide by R: 3.9857 × 10^13 / 3.1855 × 10^6 ≈ Let me compute that. 3.9857 / 3.1855 ≈ approx 1.251, and 10^13 / 10^6 = 10^7. Therefore, approx 1.251 × 10^7 m²/s². Taking the square root gives sqrt(1.251 × 10^7) ≈ sqrt(1.251) × 10^(3.5). Wait sqrt(1.251) is approx 1.118, and sqrt(10^7) is 10^(3.5) = 10^3 * sqrt(10) ≈ 1000 * 3.162 ≈ 3162 m/s. Therefore, 1.118 * 3162 ≈ Let me calculate that. 1 * 3162 = 3162, 0.118 * 3162 ≈ approx 373. So total approx 3162 + 373 ≈ 3535 m/s. Which is approx 3.535 km/s. So that's about 3.5 km/s. Therefore, again, answer A is correct.\n\nBut let me check with more accurate numbers. Because in reality, Mars has a mass of about 6.39 × 10^23 kg, which is roughly 1/10 of Earth's mass (Earth is 5.97 × 10^24 kg). The radius of Mars is about 3,389.5 km, which is roughly half of Earth's radius (Earth's radius is about 6,371 km). Let me recalculate with more accurate numbers.\n\nMars mass: 6.39 × 10^23 kg\n\nRadius: 3,389,500 meters\n\nCompute G*M:\n\n6.674×10^-11 * 6.39×10^23 ≈ Let me calculate 6.674 * 6.39 ≈ 6 * 6.39 = 38.34 + 0.674 * 6.39 ≈ approx 4.29. So total approx 38.34 + 4.29 ≈ 42.63. Therefore, 42.63 × 10^( -11 + 23 ) = 42.63 × 10^12 = 4.263 × 10^13 m³/s².\n\nDivide by R: 4.263 × 10^13 / 3.3895 × 10^6 ≈ 4.263 / 3.3895 ≈ approx 1.2576 × 10^(13-6) = 1.2576 × 10^7 m²/s².\n\nTaking square root: sqrt(1.2576 × 10^7) ≈ sqrt(1.2576) × sqrt(10^7) ≈ 1.1216 × 3.162 × 10^3 ≈ 1.1216 × 3162 ≈ Let's compute:\n\n1.1216 × 3000 = 3364.8\n\n1.1216 × 162 ≈ approx 1.1216 * 160 = 179.456 + 1.1216 * 2 ≈ 2.243 ≈ total ≈ 181.699\n\nTotal ≈ 3364.8 + 181.7 ≈ 3546.5 m/s ≈ 3.5465 km/s. So approx 3.55 km/s, which is still closest to option A, 3.5 km/s.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method—whether using ratios with Earth's known orbital velocity, or plugging in approximate or more accurate numbers—the result is around 3.5 km/s. Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.\n\nBut let me check if I made any wrong assumption. For example, the problem says \"the rate of a spacecraft orbiting Mars in uniform circular motion near its surface\". Is there any factor I didn't consider? Like atmospheric drag? No, because for orbital mechanics, we usually assume that the orbit is high enough to neglect atmospheric drag, but \"near the surface\" probably implies that we can take the orbital radius as the planet's radius. So that assumption is okay.\n\nAnother thing: the problem states \"the mass of Earth is about 10 times that of Mars\", but in reality, Earth's mass is about 9.3 times Mars' mass. Wait, let me check. Mars' mass is approximately 6.39 × 10^23 kg, Earth's is 5.97 × 10^24 kg. Dividing Earth's mass by Mars' gives 5.97 / 0.639 ≈ approx 9.34. So the problem says \"about 10 times\", which is an approximation. Similarly, Earth's radius is about 6,371 km, Mars is 3,389.5 km. Dividing Earth's radius by Mars' gives 6371 / 3389.5 ≈ 1.88, so the problem says \"about 2 times\", which is also an approximation. Therefore, given that the problem provides approximate ratios, the answer based on those approximations is 3.5 km/s. However, if we use more precise ratios, let's see:\n\nLet me recalculate the ratio using more accurate numbers. Let me take M_Earth / M_Mars ≈ 9.3, and R_Earth / R_Mars ≈ 1.88. Then the ratio v_Mars / v_Earth is sqrt( (M_Mars / M_Earth) * (R_Earth / R_Mars) ) = sqrt( (1/9.3) * 1.88 ) ≈ sqrt( 1.88 / 9.3 ) ≈ sqrt(0.202) ≈ 0.45. Then multiplying by Earth's 7.9 km/s gives 0.45 * 7.9 ≈ 3.555 km/s, which is still about 3.55 km/s. So even with more accurate numbers, it's still about 3.5-3.6 km/s. Therefore, option A is still correct.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\n(A) 3.5 km/s\n\n(B) 5.0 km/s\n\n(C) 17.7 km/s\n\n(D) 35.2 km/s\n\nSo, 3.5 km/s is option A, which is the correct answer. The other options: 5.0 km/s is less than Earth's orbital speed, but since Mars has less mass and smaller radius, the speed should be less than Earth's. Wait, Earth's is 7.9, so 5 is possible? Wait, but according to our calculation, it's about 3.5. So why is there an option B?\n\nWait, perhaps if someone made a mistake in the ratio? Let me check. Suppose someone thought that since Earth's mass is 10 times Mars, and radius 2 times, then maybe they thought that the gravity on Mars is (M/R²) which would be (1/10)/(1/2)^2 = (1/10)/ (1/4) )= 4/10 = 0.4 times Earth's gravity, which is correct. Then if someone tried to compute escape velocity instead of orbital velocity? Escape velocity is sqrt(2) times orbital velocity. So if someone confused the two, they might calculate escape velocity as sqrt(2)*3.5 ≈ 4.95 km/s ≈ 5.0 km/s, which is option B. That seems plausible. So maybe some people might confuse orbital velocity with escape velocity. But the question says \"orbiting in uniform circular motion\", which is orbital velocity, not escape velocity. Therefore, option B is incorrect. The other options: 17.7 km/s is Earth's escape velocity (about 11.2 km/s, so 17.7 is too high; maybe someone multiplied by something wrong). 35.2 km/s is way too high, probably a miscalculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
