The problem gives me some inequalities that P(x) must satisfy for all real numbers x: specifically, x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3. Also, they tell me that P(11) = 181. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, I can write it in the general form: P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are real coefficients. My goal is to find a, b, c, and then compute P(16).\n\nThe inequalities given must hold for all real numbers x. So, for all x, x² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3. Let me think about how to use these inequalities. Since these inequalities hold for all real numbers x, the difference between P(x) and the lower bound must be non-negative for all x, and similarly, the difference between the upper bound and P(x) must also be non-negative for all x.\n\nSo, let me define two quadratic polynomials:\n\n1. P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n2. (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nLet me compute these differences.\n\nFirst difference:\n\nP(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = ax² + bx + c - x² + 2x - 2 = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2).\n\nSecond difference:\n\n(2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) = 2x² - 4x + 3 - ax² - bx - c = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c).\n\nSince these quadratics must be non-negative for all real x, each of them must be a non-negative definite quadratic. For a quadratic to be non-negative for all real x, two conditions must be satisfied:\n\n1. The leading coefficient must be non-negative (i.e., ≥ 0).\n2. The discriminant must be less than or equal to 0.\n\nSo, applying this to the first difference:\n\nQuadratic 1: (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nTherefore:\n\nCondition 1: a - 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥ 1.\n\nCondition 2: Discriminant D1 = (b + 2)² - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the second difference:\n\nQuadratic 2: (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nTherefore:\n\nCondition 1: 2 - a ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≤ 2.\n\nCondition 2: Discriminant D2 = (-4 - b)² - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0.\n\nSo from the first set of conditions, we have a ≥ 1 and a ≤ 2. Therefore, a is between 1 and 2, inclusive. So a ∈ [1, 2].\n\nNow, combining these, let me note that since a is between 1 and 2, inclusive, the leading coefficients of both quadratics are non-negative, as required.\n\nNow, we need to handle the discriminant conditions. Let me write them again:\n\nFor Quadratic 1:\n\nD1 = (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0.\n\nFor Quadratic 2:\n\nD2 = (-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0.\n\nLet me simplify D2:\n\n(-4 - b)^2 = (b + 4)^2, same as (b + 2 + 2)^2. Not sure if helpful yet.\n\nSo D2 = (b + 4)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0.\n\nSo now we have two inequalities involving a, b, c. Also, we have another equation from P(11) = 181. Let's write that down.\n\nP(11) = a*(11)^2 + b*(11) + c = 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nSo we have three equations (well, inequalities and one equation). The problem is that we have two inequalities and one equation. But we need to find a, b, c. So maybe we can find that the inequalities force the discriminants to be zero? Because if the quadratic is non-negative for all x and the discriminant is zero, then the quadratic is a perfect square, touching the x-axis. But since the inequalities are for all x, if discriminant is zero, that would mean that P(x) touches the lower or upper bound at exactly one point. However, since the inequalities are for all real numbers, maybe equality occurs at some point?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only way both inequalities can hold is if P(x) is exactly equal to both bounds? But that would require x² - 2x + 2 = 2x² - 4x + 3, which would mean solving 0 = x² - 2x + 1 ⇒ (x - 1)^2 = 0 ⇒ x = 1. So only at x=1 do the two bounds meet. Therefore, perhaps P(x) touches both bounds at x=1? Let me check that.\n\nAt x=1, lower bound is 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. Upper bound is 2 - 4 + 3 = 1. So P(1) must equal 1. Therefore, P(1) = 1. Let me check if that's consistent with the inequalities. Since at x=1, both bounds are equal, so P(x) must equal 1 there.\n\nTherefore, we have another equation: P(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c = 1.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 1.\n\n2. 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nSo that's two equations with three variables, so we need another equation. The inequalities might give us another equation if the discriminants are zero. Because if we can assume that the inequalities are tight (i.e., the quadratics are zero at some point), then discriminants would be zero. But maybe not necessarily. However, given that the bounds touch only at x=1, perhaps P(x) is sandwiched between them and meets them at x=1? But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another point where the inequalities become equalities? For example, if P(x) is tangent to both the lower and upper bounds. But since the lower and upper bounds are different quadratics, except at x=1, maybe P(x) is a combination?\n\nAlternatively, since P(x) is between two quadratics, maybe P(x) is a linear combination of them? Let me think. Suppose P(x) = k*(x² - 2x + 2) + (1 - k)*(2x² - 4x + 3). But since the inequalities are x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3, if k is between 0 and 1, then maybe? Let me check.\n\nWait, if we take a convex combination of the lower and upper bounds, then for 0 ≤ k ≤ 1, P(x) would lie between them. But since P(x) is quadratic, let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute P(x) as k*(x² - 2x + 2) + (1 - k)*(2x² - 4x + 3). Let's compute that:\n\n= kx² - 2kx + 2k + 2(1 - k)x² - 4(1 - k)x + 3(1 - k)\n\n= [k + 2(1 - k)]x² + [-2k -4(1 - k)]x + [2k + 3(1 - k)]\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\nFor x²: k + 2 - 2k = 2 - k.\n\nFor x: -2k -4 + 4k = 2k - 4.\n\nFor constant term: 2k + 3 - 3k = 3 - k.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = (2 - k)x² + (2k - 4)x + (3 - k).\n\nBut since P(x) is supposed to be between the lower and upper bounds, and this is a convex combination, then for 0 ≤ k ≤ 1, we have P(x) between the lower and upper bounds. However, we need to check if this is the only possibility? Or if there are other quadratics that satisfy the inequalities?\n\nBut given that the inequalities must hold for all real x, maybe P(x) must be such a convex combination. Let me check.\n\nSuppose that P(x) - lower bound is non-negative for all x, and upper bound - P(x) is non-negative for all x. Therefore, P(x) is between the two quadratics for all x. The difference between upper and lower bound is:\n\n(2x² - 4x + 3) - (x² - 2x + 2) = x² - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2 ≥ 0 for all x. Therefore, the upper bound minus lower bound is always non-negative, and equals zero only at x = 1. Therefore, the region between the two bounds is the area between two parabolas that touch at x = 1. Therefore, any P(x) that lies between them must be such that it is a combination that doesn't cross them. Since both the lower and upper bounds are parabolas, and the difference between them is a square, maybe P(x) is also a parabola that touches both bounds at x = 1? But since at x=1, both bounds are equal, P(x) must pass through (1, 1). Also, given that P(11) = 181, maybe we can find the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, if P(x) is a convex combination as above, then we can use that expression for P(x) and use the given P(11) = 181 to find k. Let me try this approach.\n\nSo, if P(x) = (2 - k)x² + (2k - 4)x + (3 - k). Then, using P(11) = 181:\n\nCompute P(11):\n\n(2 - k)(121) + (2k - 4)(11) + (3 - k) = 181.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (2 - k)(121) = 242 - 121k.\n\nSecond term: (2k - 4)(11) = 22k - 44.\n\nThird term: 3 - k.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n242 - 121k + 22k - 44 + 3 - k = 242 - 44 + 3 + (-121k + 22k - k).\n\nCalculating constants: 242 - 44 is 198, 198 + 3 = 201.\n\nCalculating coefficients for k: -121k + 22k - k = (-121 + 22 - 1)k = (-100)k.\n\nTherefore, total expression is 201 - 100k = 181.\n\nSo 201 - 100k = 181 ⇒ -100k = 181 - 201 ⇒ -100k = -20 ⇒ k = (-20)/(-100) = 1/5.\n\nSo k = 1/5. Therefore, if this approach is valid, then P(x) is given by:\n\nP(x) = (2 - 1/5)x² + (2*(1/5) - 4)x + (3 - 1/5) = (9/5)x² + (2/5 - 4)x + (14/5).\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\nFor x²: 9/5.\n\nFor x: 2/5 - 20/5 = -18/5.\n\nConstant term: 14/5.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + 14/5.\n\nLet me check if this satisfies the earlier equation P(1) = 1:\n\nP(1) = 9/5 - 18/5 + 14/5 = (9 - 18 + 14)/5 = 5/5 = 1. Correct.\n\nAlso, check if P(11) = 181:\n\nEarlier calculation gave us that with k = 1/5, P(11) = 181. So that's good.\n\nNow, we need to check if this polynomial actually satisfies the inequalities x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real x.\n\nFirst, let's check the lower bound: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + 14/5.\n\nSubtracting the left side from the right side:\n\n(9/5 x² - 18/5 x + 14/5) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (9/5 x² - x²) + (-18/5 x + 2x) + (14/5 - 2).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n9/5 x² - 5/5 x² = 4/5 x².\n\n-18/5 x + 10/5 x = -8/5 x.\n\n14/5 - 10/5 = 4/5.\n\nTherefore, the difference is (4/5)x² - (8/5)x + 4/5. Let's factor out 4/5:\n\n4/5 [x² - 2x + 1] = 4/5 (x - 1)^2 ≥ 0 for all real x. Perfect! So the difference is non-negative, hence the lower bound holds.\n\nSimilarly, check the upper bound: (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + 14/5 ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nSubtracting the left side from the right side:\n\n(2x² - 4x + 3) - (9/5 x² - 18/5 x + 14/5) = (10/5 x² - 9/5 x²) + (-20/5 x + 18/5 x) + (15/5 - 14/5).\n\nCalculates to:\n\n(1/5)x² - (2/5)x + 1/5.\n\nFactor out 1/5:\n\n1/5 [x² - 2x + 1] = 1/5 (x - 1)^2 ≥ 0 for all real x. Perfect! Therefore, the upper bound also holds.\n\nTherefore, P(x) is indeed equal to (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + 14/5. Therefore, now we can compute P(16).\n\nCompute P(16):\n\n(9/5)*(16)^2 - (18/5)*(16) + 14/5.\n\nFirst, compute 16² = 256.\n\nSo:\n\n(9/5)*256 - (18/5)*16 + 14/5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 9*256 / 5 = 2304 / 5.\n\nSecond term: 18*16 / 5 = 288 / 5.\n\nThird term: 14 / 5.\n\nTherefore:\n\n2304/5 - 288/5 + 14/5 = (2304 - 288 + 14)/5.\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n2304 - 288 = 2016.\n\n2016 + 14 = 2030.\n\nTherefore, P(16) = 2030 / 5 = 406.\n\nWait, 2030 divided by 5 is 406? Let me check:\n\n5*400 = 2000, 2030 - 2000 = 30, 30/5=6, so total 406. Yes. So P(16) is 406.\n\nBut let me verify once again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate P(16):\n\nP(x) = (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + 14/5.\n\nAt x = 16:\n\nFirst term: 9/5 * 256. Let me compute 256 * 9 first. 256*9: 256*10 = 2560 minus 256 is 2304. So 2304/5.\n\nSecond term: 18/5 * 16: 18*16=288, so 288/5.\n\nThird term: 14/5.\n\nSo total is 2304/5 - 288/5 + 14/5 = (2304 - 288 + 14)/5. 2304 - 288 is 2016, 2016 +14 is 2030. 2030 divided by 5 is 406. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 406. However, let me check if there's another way to get P(16) without computing the entire polynomial. For example, since we know P(x) is a quadratic, and we have two points: P(1) = 1, P(11) = 181. If we can find another equation, maybe from the coefficients.\n\nBut we already found the coefficients, so it's straightforward. However, let me check if there's a possibility that there are other quadratics satisfying the inequalities. Because the problem didn't specify that P(x) is unique, but since we were given P(11) = 181, maybe it is unique. Let me confirm.\n\nEarlier, I assumed that P(x) is a convex combination of the lower and upper bounds. However, is that the only possibility? Let me think.\n\nWe had the two inequalities leading to discriminants being zero? Wait, in our case, we found that the differences between P(x) and the lower bound, and upper bound and P(x), both resulted in perfect squares (multiplied by positive constants). Therefore, their discriminants are zero. Which means that the inequalities are tight at x = 1. Therefore, our P(x) is the only quadratic that satisfies the inequalities and touches both bounds at x = 1. Since we also have the condition P(11) = 181, which uniquely determines k in the convex combination, then P(x) is uniquely determined. Therefore, 406 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there is another approach. Suppose we didn't think of convex combinations. Let me try solving the equations with the discriminants.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nFrom P(1) = 1: a + b + c = 1.\n\nFrom P(11) = 181: 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nAlso, from the discriminant conditions.\n\nFor Quadratic 1: (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) has discriminant ≤ 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\nD1 = (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, Quadratic 2: (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) has discriminant ≤ 0:\n\nD2 = (-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0.\n\nSo, we have these inequalities. Also, from the earlier, we know a is between 1 and 2. Let me use the equations from P(1) and P(11) to express b and c in terms of a, and then substitute into discriminant equations.\n\nFrom a + b + c = 1, we can write c = 1 - a - b.\n\nFrom 121a + 11b + c = 181, substitute c:\n\n121a + 11b + (1 - a - b) = 181 ⇒ 121a - a + 11b - b + 1 = 181 ⇒ 120a + 10b + 1 = 181 ⇒ 120a + 10b = 180 ⇒ Divide both sides by 10: 12a + b = 18 ⇒ b = 18 - 12a.\n\nTherefore, b is expressed in terms of a. Then c = 1 - a - b = 1 - a - (18 - 12a) = 1 - a - 18 + 12a = (1 - 18) + ( -a + 12a ) = -17 + 11a.\n\nTherefore, c = 11a - 17.\n\nSo now, we can write b and c in terms of a. Let me write them:\n\nb = 18 - 12a,\n\nc = 11a - 17.\n\nNow, let's substitute into discriminant D1 and D2.\n\nStarting with D1:\n\nD1 = (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0.\n\nCompute b + 2 = (18 - 12a) + 2 = 20 - 12a.\n\nCompute c - 2 = (11a - 17) - 2 = 11a - 19.\n\nTherefore,\n\nD1 = (20 - 12a)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(11a - 19) ≤ 0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (20 - 12a)^2 = [ -12a + 20 ]² = (12a - 20)^2 = 144a² - 480a + 400.\n\nSecond term: 4*(a - 1)*(11a - 19) = 4*[11a(a - 1) - 19(a - 1)] = 4*[11a² - 11a - 19a + 19] = 4*[11a² - 30a + 19] = 44a² - 120a + 76.\n\nTherefore, D1 = (144a² - 480a + 400) - (44a² - 120a + 76) = 144a² - 480a + 400 - 44a² + 120a - 76.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(144a² - 44a²) + (-480a + 120a) + (400 - 76) = 100a² - 360a + 324.\n\nTherefore, D1 = 100a² - 360a + 324 ≤ 0.\n\nLet me factor this quadratic in a. Let me see if it can be factored.\n\nFirst, note that 100a² - 360a + 324. Let me divide all terms by 4: 25a² - 90a + 81. Let me check discriminant of this quadratic:\n\nDiscriminant D = 90² - 4*25*81 = 8100 - 8100 = 0. Oh! So discriminant is zero. Therefore, 25a² - 90a + 81 is a perfect square. Specifically, since discriminant is zero, it factors as (sqrt(25)a - something)^2. Let me compute:\n\nsqrt(25a²) is 5a. The middle term is -90a. Let me write it as (5a - k)^2 = 25a² - 10k a + k². Comparing with 25a² - 90a + 81:\n\n-10k = -90 ⇒ k = 9. Then k² = 81. Perfect! Therefore, 25a² - 90a + 81 = (5a - 9)^2. Therefore, original D1 is 4*(5a - 9)^2 ≤ 0. Since 4 is positive, this implies that (5a - 9)^2 ≤ 0. The square of a real number is non-negative, so the only solution is (5a - 9)^2 = 0 ⇒ 5a - 9 = 0 ⇒ a = 9/5 = 1.8.\n\nTherefore, D1 = 0 only when a = 9/5. Therefore, the discriminant condition D1 ≤ 0 forces a = 9/5. Similarly, we can check D2.\n\nSo, a is uniquely determined as 9/5. Therefore, since a is determined, we can find b and c:\n\nFrom above, b = 18 - 12a = 18 - 12*(9/5) = 18 - (108/5) = (90/5 - 108/5) = (-18/5).\n\nSimilarly, c = 11a - 17 = 11*(9/5) - 17 = 99/5 - 85/5 = 14/5. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, this confirms that P(x) is indeed (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + 14/5.\n\nTherefore, P(16) is 406 as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 406.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{406}\n</think>"}
