The polynomial is given as P(x) = 2x³ - 2a x² + (a² - 81)x - c, where a and c are positive integers. Jon initially can't determine a and c because there's more than one polynomial. Then Steve gives Jon the value of a, but Jon still can't figure out c because there are two possibilities. The question is asking for the sum of those two possible c values.\n\nFirst, let me recall that if a polynomial has roots that are all positive integers, then we can express it in terms of its roots. Since it's a cubic polynomial, there are three roots. Let me denote the roots as r, s, and t, all positive integers. Then, using Vieta's formula, we can relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the roots.\n\nBut the polynomial is given as 2x³ - 2a x² + (a² - 81)x - c. Normally, Vieta's formula applies to monic polynomials (leading coefficient 1), but here the leading coefficient is 2. So I need to adjust for that.\n\nFor a cubic polynomial with leading coefficient 2, the general form is 2(x - r)(x - s)(x - t). Let me expand that to compare with the given polynomial.\n\nExpanding 2(x - r)(x - s)(x - t):\n\nFirst, expand (x - r)(x - s)(x - t):\n\n= (x - r)[(x - s)(x - t)]\n= (x - r)[x² - (s + t)x + st]\n= x³ - (s + t)x² + stx - r x² + r(s + t)x - r s t\n= x³ - (r + s + t)x² + (rs + rt + st)x - rst\n\nThen multiply by 2:\n\n2x³ - 2(r + s + t)x² + 2(rs + rt + st)x - 2rst\n\nCompare this with the given polynomial:\n\nP(x) = 2x³ - 2a x² + (a² - 81)x - c\n\nTherefore, by matching coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of x³: 2 = 2, which checks out.\n- Coefficient of x²: -2(r + s + t) = -2a ⇒ r + s + t = a\n- Coefficient of x: 2(rs + rt + st) = a² - 81\n- Constant term: -2rst = -c ⇒ c = 2rst\n\nSo, we have the following equations:\n\n1. r + s + t = a\n2. 2(rs + rt + st) = a² - 81\n3. c = 2rst\n\nSince r, s, t are positive integers, and a and c are positive integers as well.\n\nSo Jon is given that there are multiple polynomials with these properties. Then Steve gives the value of a, but Jon still can't determine c because there are two possibilities. Therefore, there must be two different triples (r, s, t) with the same a but different c. The problem is to find the sum of those two c's.\n\nTherefore, my task is to find all possible triples (r, s, t) of positive integers such that equations 1 and 2 hold for some a, and then find the a for which there are two different triples leading to different c's. Then sum those c's.\n\nSo, let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me denote S = r + s + t = a\n\nand Q = rs + rt + st = (a² - 81)/2\n\nand c = 2rst.\n\nTherefore, given S, Q is determined by a² - 81 over 2. Since Q must be an integer, a² - 81 must be even, so a² must be odd. Therefore, a must be odd, since odd squared is odd, even squared is even. Therefore, a is odd.\n\nSo first, a is odd. Also, since r, s, t are positive integers, S = a ≥ 3 (since the minimal sum for three positive integers is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3). Also, Q must be positive. So (a² - 81)/2 > 0 ⇒ a² > 81 ⇒ a > 9. Since a is a positive integer, a ≥ 10. But since a must be odd, the minimal possible a is 11. Therefore, a ≥ 11 and odd.\n\nSo possible values of a start from 11, 13, 15,... etc. However, we need to find for which a there are multiple triples (r, s, t) with sum S = a and Q = (a² - 81)/2. Then, among those a's, there is one for which there are two different triples, leading to two different c's. The problem says that when Steve gives Jon a, Jon still can't determine c because there are two possibilities. Therefore, there is a unique a (probably) for which there are exactly two triples. Then, we need to find those two c's and sum them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For a starting from 11 upwards (odd numbers), compute Q = (a² - 81)/2.\n\n2. For each a, find all triples (r, s, t) of positive integers with r + s + t = a and rs + rt + st = Q.\n\n3. For each such a, check if there are multiple triples. Once we find an a with exactly two triples, compute c = 2rst for each and sum them.\n\nBut how do I find the triples (r, s, t) for given S and Q?\n\nGiven that for three variables, r + s + t = S and rs + rt + st = Q. Also, we can relate this to the roots of a quadratic or using symmetric sums.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that for three numbers, (r + s + t)^2 = r² + s² + t² + 2(rs + rt + st). Therefore:\n\nS² = (r² + s² + t²) + 2Q ⇒ r² + s² + t² = S² - 2Q.\n\nBut not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, maybe we can think of the problem as solving for integers r, s, t given their sum and sum of products.\n\nAlternatively, since the roots are positive integers, we can assume WLOG that r ≤ s ≤ t. Then, we can iterate over possible values of r, s, t.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, let me try to find a way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express the problem in terms of variables.\n\nLet me denote that for given S and Q, we can think of the monic polynomial x³ - S x² + Q x - (rst) = 0. However, in our case, the polynomial is 2x³ - 2S x² + (2Q) x - 2rst. Wait, but in our problem, the coefficient of x is 2Q, but according to Vieta, the coefficient is a² - 81, which is 2Q. Therefore, yes, that's consistent.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to note that for fixed S and Q, the number of triples (r, s, t) is determined by how we can write S and Q with positive integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that given S and Q, we can find possible triples. For example, if we fix r, then s + t = S - r and st = Q - r(S - r). Let me check:\n\nGiven r + s + t = S ⇒ s + t = S - r.\n\nAlso, rs + rt + st = Q ⇒ r(s + t) + st = Q ⇒ r(S - r) + st = Q ⇒ st = Q - r(S - r).\n\nTherefore, given r, we can compute st and s + t. Then, s and t are roots of the quadratic equation x² - (S - r)x + [Q - r(S - r)] = 0.\n\nTherefore, for each possible r, we can compute discriminant D = [S - r]^2 - 4[Q - r(S - r)].\n\nIf D is a perfect square, then s and t are integers.\n\nTherefore, this gives us a way to find possible triples. So for each a (odd, starting from 11), compute Q = (a² - 81)/2, then for each possible r (from 1 to floor(S/3)), compute D and check if it's a perfect square. If so, then we have solutions.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can try this approach.\n\nBut since this is a problem-solving question, maybe there's a specific a for which there are two different triples. Let me try to find such a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find relations between S and Q.\n\nGiven that S = a, and Q = (a² - 81)/2.\n\nBut also, for three positive integers r ≤ s ≤ t, with r + s + t = S and rs + rt + st = Q.\n\nLet me also note that for fixed S, Q is maximized when the numbers are as equal as possible, and minimized when one number is as small as possible (like 1, 1, S - 2). Therefore, perhaps for each a, there are limited possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find equations.\n\nLet me try for specific a's. Since a must be odd and ≥11, let me start checking from a=11 upwards until I find an a that gives multiple triples.\n\nLet me start with a=11.\n\nCompute Q=(11² -81)/2=(121 -81)/2=40/2=20.\n\nSo Q=20. Now, need to find triples r, s, t with r + s + t = 11 and rs + rt + st = 20.\n\nLet me try to find such triples.\n\nAssume r ≤ s ≤ t. Let me try r=1:\n\nThen s + t = 10, and st = 20 - r(s + t) = 20 - 1*10 = 10.\n\nSo need s + t =10, st=10. The quadratic equation is x² -10x +10=0. The discriminant is 100 -40=60, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, no integer solutions here.\n\nNext, r=2:\n\ns + t = 11 - 2 = 9\n\nst = Q - r(s + t) = 20 - 2*9 = 20 - 18 = 2.\n\nSo s + t =9, st=2. Quadratic equation x² -9x +2=0. Discriminant 81 -8=73, not a square. No solution.\n\nr=3:\n\ns + t=11 -3=8\n\nst=20 - 3*8=20 -24= -4. Negative, impossible. Therefore no solution. So no solutions for a=11. Therefore, no such polynomial. Therefore a=11 is invalid.\n\nWait, but Steve says there is more than one polynomial. Therefore, there must be some a where there are multiple triples. So a=11 is invalid. Let me check a=13.\n\na=13:\n\nQ=(13² -81)/2=(169 -81)/2=88/2=44.\n\nSo Q=44. Now, find triples with sum 13 and product sums 44.\n\nAgain, starting with r=1:\n\ns + t=12, st=44 -1*12=44 -12=32.\n\nQuadratic equation x² -12x +32=0. Discriminant 144 -128=16, which is square. Solutions (12 ±4)/2= 8 or 4. Therefore s=4, t=8. So triple (1,4,8). Since r=1 ≤ s=4 ≤ t=8. Also, check if there are other permutations, but since we fix r ≤ s ≤ t, we need to check other r's.\n\nCheck if there are other triples.\n\nr=2:\n\ns + t=13 -2=11.\n\nst=44 -2*11=44 -22=22.\n\nEquation x² -11x +22=0. Discriminant 121 -88=33, not square.\n\nr=3:\n\ns + t=10, st=44 -3*10=44 -30=14.\n\nEquation x² -10x +14=0. Discriminant 100 -56=44, not square.\n\nr=4:\n\ns + t=9, st=44 -4*9=44 -36=8.\n\nEquation x² -9x +8=0. Solutions (9 ±√(81 -32))/2=(9 ±√49)/2=(9±7)/2. Therefore 8 or 1. But since r=4, and s ≥ r=4, then s and t must be ≥4. However, solutions are 8 and 1. But 1 is less than 4, so invalid. Therefore, no solution here.\n\nWait, but if we consider s and t, since s ≥ r=4 and t ≥ s, then s and t must be ≥4. However, the solutions are 8 and 1. Since 1 is less than 4, we discard. Therefore, no solution here.\n\nSimilarly, higher r's will have smaller s + t, leading to even smaller st. Therefore, no more solutions. So only one triple (1,4,8). Therefore, for a=13, only one polynomial. Therefore Jon would be able to determine c. But in the problem statement, when Steve gives a, Jon still can't determine c. Therefore, need to check higher a's.\n\nNext a=15.\n\nQ=(15² -81)/2=(225 -81)/2=144/2=72.\n\nSo Q=72. Find triples with sum 15 and rs + rt + st=72.\n\nStart with r=1:\n\ns + t=14, st=72 -1*14=58.\n\nEquation x² -14x +58=0. Discriminant 196 -232= -36. No solution.\n\nr=2:\n\ns + t=13, st=72 -2*13=72 -26=46.\n\nEquation x² -13x +46=0. Discriminant 169 - 184= -15. No solution.\n\nr=3:\n\ns + t=12, st=72 -3*12=72 -36=36.\n\nEquation x² -12x +36=0. Discriminant 144 -144=0. Therefore, double root at 6. Therefore s=t=6. So triple (3,6,6). Since 3 ≤6 ≤6. So that's valid.\n\nCheck other possibilities.\n\nr=4:\n\ns + t=11, st=72 -4*11=72 -44=28.\n\nEquation x² -11x +28=0. Discriminant 121 -112=9. Square root of 9 is 3. Therefore solutions (11 ±3)/2= 7 or 4. Therefore s=4, t=7. Since r=4, s=4, t=7. Therefore triple (4,4,7). Check if 4 ≤4 ≤7, yes. So another triple.\n\nTherefore, two triples so far: (3,6,6) and (4,4,7). Let me check if there are more.\n\nr=5:\n\ns + t=15 -5=10. st=72 -5*10=72 -50=22.\n\nEquation x² -10x +22=0. Discriminant 100 -88=12. Not square.\n\nr=6:\n\ns + t=15 -6=9. st=72 -6*9=72 -54=18.\n\nEquation x² -9x +18=0. Discriminant 81 -72=9. Square root 3. Solutions (9 ±3)/2=6 or 3. But since r=6, s and t must be ≥6. However, solutions are 6 and 3. 3 is less than 6, so invalid. Therefore, only s=6 and t=3, but since s ≥ r=6, t would have to be 6 and s=... Wait, if s ≥ r=6, then s ≥6 and t ≥s. So s + t=9. If s ≥6, then possible s=6, t=3, but t must be ≥s. Therefore impossible. Hence no solution here.\n\nTherefore, for a=15, we have two triples: (3,6,6) and (4,4,7). Therefore, Jon, after being told a=15, would still have two possibilities for c. Therefore, this seems like the a that Steve told Jon. Then the problem says that Jon says there are still two possible c's. Therefore, this is likely the a we need. Let me check if there are more a's with multiple triples, but maybe there's only one such a? Let me check a=17.\n\nBut before that, let me compute c for the two triples for a=15.\n\nFirst triple: (3,6,6). Then c=2*rst=2*3*6*6=2*108=216.\n\nSecond triple: (4,4,7). c=2*4*4*7=2*112=224.\n\nTherefore, the two possible c's are 216 and 224, whose sum is 216 + 224 = 440. Therefore, the answer is 440? Wait, but let me check if there are other a's with multiple triples. Let me check a=17.\n\na=17:\n\nQ=(17² -81)/2=(289 -81)/2=208/2=104.\n\nSo Q=104.

Let me check a=17 again? Wait, already checked. How about a=9? Wait, a must be greater than 9 because a² must be greater than 81. a=9 gives Q=(81 -81)/2=0, which would mean rs + rt + st=0, impossible. So no.\n\nTherefore, seems like a=15 is the unique a for which there are two triples. Therefore, the two c's are 216 and 224, sum is 440. Therefore, the answer is 440.\n\nBut let me check if there are other a's with multiple triples. Let me check a=7? No, a must be ≥11. Wait, let me check a= something else. Maybe I missed something?\n\nWait, for example, let me check a=27? Maybe?\n\nBut that might take too long, but let me try a few more.\n\na=27:\n\nQ=(729 -81)/2=648/2=324.\n\nLooking for triples with sum 27 and rs + rt + st=324.\n\nLet me try r=9:\n\ns + t=27 -9=18, st=324 -9*18=324 -162=162. Equation x² -18x +162. Discriminant 324 - 648= -324. No.\n\nr=6:\n\ns + t=21, st=324 -6*21=324 -126=198. Equation x² -21x +198. Discriminant 441 - 792= -351. No.\n\nr=3:\n\ns + t=24, st=324 -3*24=324 -72=252. Equation x² -24x +252. Discriminant negative.\n\nr= maybe higher?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another a with multiple triples. But since in the problem statement, Jon says that after being told a, there are still two possible c's. So if there are multiple a's with this property, but the problem says that Steve writes down a positive integer (so unique a?), but Jon says after being told a, there are two c's. Therefore, there must be only one such a. Since we found a=15, and others up to a=27 don't work, maybe that is the one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another a with multiple triples. Let me check a=25 didn't work. Let me check a= something smaller, like a=?\n\nWait, a=15 is the first one with multiple triples. Let me check a= something else. Maybe a=?\n\nWait, let me check a=21 again. For a=21, Q=180. Let me try r=5:\n\ns + t=16, st=180 -5*16=180 -80=100. Equation x² -16x +100. Discriminant negative. What if r=?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with a= something else. Let me check a= something else. Maybe a=?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another a between 15 and 27. Let me check a=17, which didn't work. a=19 didn't work. a=21 didn't work. a=23 didn't work. So seems like only a=15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 216 + 224 = 440. Therefore, the sum is 440. Let me check again the calculations for a=15.\n\nFor a=15:\n\nFirst triple: (3,6,6). Then c=2*3*6*6=2*108=216. Correct.\n\nSecond triple: (4,4,7). c=2*4*4*7=2*112=224. Correct. Sum is 216 + 224 = 440.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 440.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there are other triples for a=15. When I checked earlier, for r=3 and r=4, got those two triples. For other r's:\n\nr=5:\n\ns + t=10, st=72 -5*10=72 -50=22. Equation x² -10x +22. Discriminant negative. So no. So only two triples. Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, I think 440 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{440}\n</think>"}
