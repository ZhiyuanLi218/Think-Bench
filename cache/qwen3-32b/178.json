So, the question is about a proton and a neutron fusing to form a deuteron and emitting a gamma photon. We need to evaluate which of the statements A through D are correct based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a deuteron is. A deuteron is the nucleus of deuterium, which consists of one proton and one neutron. So, when a proton (which is a hydrogen-1 nucleus) and a neutron fuse, they should form deuterium (which is hydrogen-2), right? The symbol for deuterium is usually written as ²H or sometimes as ²₁H. But in the options given, there's an equation in option A that says ¹H + ¹₀n → ³H + γ. Wait, ³H is tritium, which has one proton and two neutrons. That doesn't make sense because fusing a proton and a neutron should give deuterium (mass number 2), not tritium (mass number 3). So option A is probably wrong. Let me check that again. The reaction should be ¹H + ¹₀n → ²H + γ. But in option A, it's written as ³H, so that's incorrect. So A is wrong. So A is not correct. So we can eliminate A.\n\nMoving on to option B: The mass defect in the fusion reaction is Δm = m₁ + m₂ - m₃. The mass defect is the difference between the initial mass and the final mass. Since a proton and neutron are combining into a deuteron, the initial mass is m₁ + m₂ and the final mass is m₃. So the mass defect would be (m₁ + m₂) - m₃. Wait, if the deuteron is less massive than the sum of the proton and neutron, then the mass defect is positive. So yes, B says Δm is m₁ + m₂ - m₃. So that seems correct. Because mass defect is the amount of mass that is converted into energy. So B is correct. So B is a possible correct answer.\n\nOption C: The energy of the emitted gamma photon is E = (m₃ - m₁ - m₂)c. Wait, energy is related to mass defect via E = Δm c². The mass defect is Δm = m₁ + m₂ - m₃. So the energy released should be Δm c² = (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c². But option C says E = (m₃ - m₁ - m₂)c. Which would be negative of the correct value, and multiplied by c instead of c squared. So that seems incorrect. Therefore, C is wrong.\n\nOption D: The wavelength of the gamma photon is λ = h / [(m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c²]. Let's think about this. The energy of the photon is E = hc/λ. Also, E is equal to the energy released, which is (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c². So setting them equal: hc/λ = (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c². Solving for λ: λ = h / [(m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c]. Wait, but option D says λ = h / [(m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c²]. So the denominator in D has c squared, but according to my calculation, it should be just c. Therefore, D is incorrect? Wait, let me check again.\n\nEnergy of photon E = hc/λ. And E is also equal to Δm c² = (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c². Therefore:\n\nhc/λ = (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c² → λ = hc / [ (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c² ] = h / [ (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c ]\n\nSo the correct expression for λ is h divided by [ (mass defect) times c ], but option D has h divided by [ (mass defect) times c squared ]. Therefore, D is wrong. Wait, but the answer options might have different notation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me verify the energy again. The energy of the photon comes from the mass defect. The mass defect is Δm = m₁ + m₂ - m₃. The energy equivalent is Δm c². So E_photon = (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c². Then, using E = hc/λ, so λ = hc / E. Therefore:\n\nλ = hc / [ (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c² ] = h / [ (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c ]\n\nSo the correct wavelength is h divided by [ (mass defect) times c ], but option D says h divided by [ (mass defect) times c squared ]. Therefore, D is incorrect. Therefore, only B is correct?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recall that E = hc/λ. And E is also equal to Δm c². So solving for λ gives λ = hc/(Δm c²) = h/(Δm c). Therefore, yes, D is incorrect because it has c² in the denominator instead of c. Therefore, D is wrong.\n\nSo, from the options, B is correct. Let me check again the options. The options are (A) incorrect, (B) correct, (C) incorrect, (D) incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is B?\n\nBut let me check again. Wait, the problem says \"the following statements are correct. Options: (A)... (B)... etc. Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So maybe multiple options are correct? Wait, the original question didn't specify if multiple options can be correct. The way it's phrased, \"the following statements are correct. Options: (A)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" Maybe in Chinese context, sometimes multiple choice options are possible. Wait, in the original problem statement, it's possible that more than one is correct. Let me check again.\n\nBut according to my analysis, only B is correct. Let me check again each option.\n\nOption A: The nuclear reaction equation is ¹H + ¹₀n → ³H + γ. As I thought earlier, deuterium is ²H, not ³H. ³H would require two neutrons and one proton. Therefore, A is wrong.\n\nOption B: The mass defect is Δm = m₁ + m₂ - m₃. Yes, because mass defect is initial mass minus final mass. So since the initial mass is proton plus neutron (m₁ + m₂) and the final mass is m₃ (the deuteron), so yes, the mass defect is m₁ + m₂ - m₃. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: The energy of the gamma photon is E = (m₃ - m₁ - m₂)c. Well, the energy should be (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c². So option C has the sign reversed and only one factor of c instead of c squared. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: The wavelength is λ = h / [ (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c² ]. As we derived earlier, the correct expression should be λ = h / [ (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)c ]. Therefore, D is incorrect because it has c² instead of c. Therefore, only B is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to think about D. Maybe there's a different approach. For example, energy of the photon is E = (mass defect) * c². Then, since E = hc/λ, so λ = hc / E = hc / [ (mass defect) c² ] = h / [ (mass defect) c ] as before. So D is wrong. Therefore, only B is correct. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I made an error in the reaction equation. Let me write the correct nuclear reaction. A proton is ¹₁H, a neutron is ¹₀n. When they fuse, they form a deuteron, which is ²₁H (deuterium). The correct reaction should be:\n\n¹₁H + ¹₀n → ²₁H + γ.\n\nSo the correct equation would have ²H on the right side. But option A says ³H, which is incorrect. Therefore, A is wrong. So yes, B is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option B. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
