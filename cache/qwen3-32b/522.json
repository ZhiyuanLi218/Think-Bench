The task is to find the least integer $ k > 1 $ such that $ a_k $ is an integer. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the recursive formula. It says that for each $ n \\geq 1 $, the difference between consecutive terms $ a_{n+1} - a_n $ is related to the equation $ 5^{(a_{n + 1} - a_n)} - 1 = \\frac {1}{n + \\frac {2}{3}} $. So maybe I can solve for $ a_{n+1} - a_n $ first?\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\n$ 5^{(a_{n + 1} - a_n)} = 1 + \\frac {1}{n + \\frac {2}{3}} $.\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, $ n + \\frac{2}{3} $ is the same as $ \\frac{3n + 2}{3} $. Therefore, $ \\frac{1}{n + \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{3n + 2} $. So the equation becomes:\n\n$ 5^{(a_{n + 1} - a_n)} = 1 + \\frac{3}{3n + 2} $.\n\nSimplify the right-hand side further:\n\n$ 1 + \\frac{3}{3n + 2} = \\frac{(3n + 2) + 3}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 5}{3n + 2} $. Wait, hold on, let me check that again. If I have 1 + 3/(3n + 2), then converting 1 to (3n + 2)/(3n + 2), so adding 3/(3n + 2) gives (3n + 2 + 3)/denominator? Wait, no:\n\nWait, 1 is equal to $ \\frac{3n + 2}{3n + 2} $, so adding $ \\frac{3}{3n + 2} $ gives $ \\frac{3n + 2 + 3}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 5}{3n + 2} $. Wait, but that would be if we added 3 to the numerator. But 1 + 3/(3n + 2) is indeed equal to (3n + 2 + 3)/ (3n + 2). So yes, numerator is 3n + 5. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n$ 5^{(a_{n + 1} - a_n)} = \\frac{3n + 5}{3n + 2} $.\n\nTherefore, taking logarithm base 5 on both sides:\n\n$ a_{n + 1} - a_n = \\log_5 \\left( \\frac{3n + 5}{3n + 2} \\right ) $.\n\nTherefore, the difference between terms is the log of that fraction. Therefore, to find $ a_k $, we can sum up these differences from n=1 to n=k-1, since:\n\n$ a_k = a_1 + \\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} (a_{n+1} - a_n) $.\n\nGiven that $ a_1 = 1 $, so:\n\n$ a_k = 1 + \\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} \\log_5 \\left( \\frac{3n + 5}{3n + 2} \\right ) $.\n\nNow, using logarithm properties, the sum of logs is the log of the product. Therefore:\n\n$ a_k = 1 + \\log_5 \\left( \\prod_{n=1}^{k-1} \\frac{3n + 5}{3n + 2} \\right ) $.\n\nSo, let's compute the product $ \\prod_{n=1}^{k-1} \\frac{3n + 5}{3n + 2} $.\n\nLet me try to write out the terms of the product to see if it telescopes. Let's consider:\n\nFor each term $ \\frac{3n + 5}{3n + 2} $, let's substitute m = n + something?\n\nLet me write out the terms for n from 1 to, say, m (where m = k - 1). Let me compute:\n\nFor n=1: $ \\frac{3(1) + 5}{3(1) + 2} = \\frac{8}{5} $\n\nFor n=2: $ \\frac{3(2) + 5}{3(2) + 2} = \\frac{11}{8} $\n\nFor n=3: $ \\frac{3(3) + 5}{3(3) + 2} = \\frac{14}{11} $\n\nFor n=4: $ \\frac{3(4) + 5}{3(4) + 2} = \\frac{17}{14} $\n\nFor n=5: $ \\frac{20}{17} $\n\n...\n\nSo each numerator is 3n + 5 and denominator is 3n + 2. So if we look at the product:\n\nProduct = $ \\frac{8}{5} \\times \\frac{11}{8} \\times \\frac{14}{11} \\times \\frac{17}{14} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{3(k - 1) + 5}{3(k - 1) + 2} $\n\nSimplify term by term. Let's note that 8 cancels with denominator of next term, 11 cancels with denominator of the next term, etc. So this is a telescoping product. Let's see:\n\nThe first denominator is 5, and then the numerators are 8, 11, 14,... up to 3(k - 1) + 5. Let me compute the last numerator and denominator.\n\nThe last term in the product is when n = k - 1:\n\nNumerator: 3(k - 1) + 5 = 3k - 3 + 5 = 3k + 2\n\nDenominator: 3(k - 1) + 2 = 3k - 3 + 2 = 3k - 1\n\nWait, so the last term is $ \\frac{3k + 2}{3k - 1} $. Therefore, when we take the product:\n\nThe product telescopes such that all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving the first denominator and the last numerator. Therefore, the entire product is $ \\frac{3k + 2}{5} $.\n\nWait, let me check with small k. Let's take k=2. Then the product is from n=1 to 1, which is 8/5. According to formula, 3k + 2 over 5, where k=2: 3*2 + 2 = 8, so 8/5. Correct. For k=3, product is (8/5)*(11/8) = 11/5. According to formula, 3*3 + 2 = 11, over 5. Correct. For k=4, product is (8/5)*(11/8)*(14/11)=14/5. Which is 3*4 + 2 = 14 over 5. Correct. So yes, general formula is:\n\nProduct from n=1 to k-1 of [ (3n +5)/(3n + 2) ] = (3k + 2)/5.\n\nTherefore, going back to the expression for $ a_k $:\n\n$ a_k = 1 + \\log_5 \\left( \\frac{3k + 2}{5} \\right ) $.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n$ a_k = 1 + \\log_5 (3k + 2) - \\log_5 5 $.\n\nSince $ \\log_5 5 = 1 $, so:\n\n$ a_k = 1 + \\log_5 (3k + 2) - 1 = \\log_5 (3k + 2) $.\n\nTherefore, $ a_k = \\log_5 (3k + 2) $. Therefore, for $ a_k $ to be integer, $ 3k + 2 $ must be a power of 5. Let me note that.\n\nSo we need $ 3k + 2 = 5^m $, where m is a positive integer. Since $ a_1 = 1 $, let's check for k > 1, the minimal such k.\n\nTherefore, solving for k:\n\n$ 3k + 2 = 5^m $\n\n=> $ k = \\frac{5^m - 2}{3} $\n\nWe need k to be integer greater than 1. So we need $ 5^m \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 $, because $ 5^m - 2 $ must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me compute $ 5^m \\mod 3 $. Since 5 ≡ 2 mod 3, so 5^m ≡ 2^m mod 3.\n\nWe need 2^m ≡ 2 mod 3. Let's solve for m:\n\n2^m ≡ 2 mod 3.\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 3 are coprime):\n\n2^{m - 1} ≡ 1 mod 3.\n\nWe know that 2^2 ≡ 1 mod 3, so the order of 2 mod 3 is 2. Therefore, 2^{m - 1} ≡ 1 mod 3 implies that m - 1 is a multiple of 2, i.e., m - 1 = 2t, so m = 2t + 1, where t ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, m must be odd. Therefore, m = 1, 3, 5, etc.\n\nLet me check for m = 1:\n\nm=1: 5^1 - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3, so k = 3 / 3 = 1. But we need k > 1, so discard m=1.\n\nm=3: 5^3 - 2 = 125 - 2 = 123. Then k = 123 / 3 = 41. So k=41. Let's check if that's the minimal.\n\nCheck m=2: m=2 is even, so according to above, 2^m mod 3 is 2^2=4≡1 mod 3, which is not 2. So 5^2 - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23. 23 / 3 ≈ 7.666... not integer. So not valid.\n\nm=3: as above, gives k=41. What about m=5? 5^5=3125. 3125 - 2=3123. Divided by 3: 3123 / 3= 1041. So that's also integer, but larger than 41, so 41 is smaller.\n\nSo the minimal k>1 is 41? Wait, but let me check m=1 gives k=1, which is allowed but we need k>1. So next possible is m=3, which gives k=41. Is there any m between 1 and 3? m must be integer, so m=2 is even, which doesn't work. Therefore, yes, the next is m=3. Therefore, k=41.\n\nBut before finalizing this answer, let me verify with the original problem. Let me check if for k=41, a_k is indeed integer.\n\nGiven that a_k = log_5(3k + 2). For k=41, 3*41 + 2 = 123 + 2 = 125. 125 is 5^3, so log_5(125)=3, which is integer. So yes, a_41=3. So that works.\n\nBut let me check if there is a smaller k>1. For example, maybe m= something else?\n\nWait, m must be odd. So m=1 gives k=1, m=3 gives k=41. What about m= -1? No, m must be positive integer because 5^m must be greater than 2. So m=1 is the first. Therefore, the next is m=3. Therefore, k=41 is the minimal k>1. Therefore, answer is 41?\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there are any other possible m between 1 and 3? Well, m must be integer, so no. Let me check m=0? 5^0=1. 1 - 2 = -1. Negative k, invalid. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in my telescoping product? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal product: product from n=1 to k-1 of (3n + 5)/(3n + 2). Let me write terms:\n\nFor n=1: (3*1 + 5)/(3*1 + 2) = 8/5\n\nFor n=2: 11/8\n\nFor n=3: 14/11\n\n...\n\nFor n = k-1: [3(k-1) +5]/[3(k-1) +2] = (3k -3 +5)/(3k -3 +2) = (3k +2)/(3k -1)\n\nTherefore, multiplying all terms:\n\n(8/5)*(11/8)*(14/11)*...*((3k + 2)/(3k -1)). All the intermediate terms cancel, leaving (3k + 2)/5. Correct. Therefore, the product is indeed (3k + 2)/5. Therefore, the expression for a_k is log_5( (3k + 2)/5 ) + 1 = log_5(3k + 2) - log_5(5) + 1 = log_5(3k + 2) -1 +1 = log_5(3k + 2). Correct. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that a_k is integer iff 3k + 2 is a power of 5, and the minimal k>1 is 41. Therefore, answer is 41. But wait, let me check for m=3, which gives 5^3=125. 3k + 2=125 => k=(125-2)/3=123/3=41. Correct.\n\nBut let me check if there is a smaller k>1. Let's check for m=1: gives k=1. m=2: 5^2=25. 3k +2=25 => k=23/3≈7.666, not integer. m=3: 125 gives k=41. m=4: 5^4=625. 3k +2=625 => k=(625 - 2)/3=623/3≈207.666, not integer. m=5: 5^5=3125. 3k +2=3125 => k=(3125 - 2)/3= 3123/3=1041. So integer, but larger. Therefore, yes, the next possible k after 1 is 41. Therefore, answer is 41.\n\nBut let me check for m= something else. For example, maybe m=  something where 5^m -2 is divisible by 3. Wait, we already considered that. Since m must be odd, as 5^m ≡ 2^m ≡ 2 mod 3 when m is odd. Let me check m=1: 2^1=2 mod 3. Correct. m=3: 2^3=8≡2 mod 3. Correct. m=5: 2^5=32≡ 32-30=2 mod 3. Yes. So yes, only odd m. Therefore, next m after 1 is 3. Therefore, answer is 41.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other solutions between m=1 and m=3. Since m must be integer, there are none. Therefore, 41 is the minimal k>1. Therefore, answer is 41.\n\nBut let me check with k=41 in the original recursion, just to be safe.\n\nCompute a_41 = log_5(3*41 + 2) = log_5(125) = 3. So integer. Now, check if for k=41, all previous terms are consistent? Well, since the formula for a_k is log_5(3k + 2), which we derived via telescoping. So for example, a_1 = log_5(3*1 + 2)=log_5(5)=1, which matches. So yes, the formula holds for all k ≥1. Therefore, if 3k + 2 is a power of 5, then a_k is integer. Therefore, the first k>1 is 41. Therefore, answer is 41. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{41}.\n\nWait, but before I finish, let me check if there's a possible mistake in the telescoping product. Suppose I made a mistake in the product? For example, if I thought the product was something else. Let me take k=2. Then product from n=1 to 1: 8/5. Then a_2 = 1 + log_5(8/5). But according to the formula, a_k = log_5(3k + 2). For k=2, log_5(8). Let's check:\n\nOriginal formula: a_2 = 1 + log_5(8/5) = 1 + log_5(8) - log_5(5) = 1 + log_5(8) - 1 = log_5(8). Which is equal to log_5(3*2 + 2) = log_5(8). Correct. Similarly, check for k=3: a_3 = log_5(11). According to the formula, 1 + log_5( (product) ). Product is 8/5 * 11/8 = 11/5. Therefore, a_3 = 1 + log_5(11/5) = 1 + log_5(11) - 1 = log_5(11). Which is log_5(3*3 + 2)=log_5(11). Correct. Therefore, formula is correct. Therefore, conclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 41. So I think that is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{41}\n</think>"}
