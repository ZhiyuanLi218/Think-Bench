Hmm, let me think about how to do this. First, I remember that a terminating decimal is a decimal that ends, unlike repeating decimals which go on forever. For a fraction to have a terminating decimal, the denominator must be of the form 2^n * 5^m, where n and m are non-negative integers. So maybe I should check if 160 can be expressed in that form?\n\nLet me factor 160. Let's see, 160 divided by 2 is 80, divided by 2 again is 40, again by 2 is 20, again by 2 is 10, again by 2 is 5. So that's 2^5 times 5^1. Yeah, so 2 to the fifth power times 5. So since the prime factors are only 2 and 5, that means 57/160 should indeed convert to a terminating decimal. Good.\n\nNow, how do I actually convert it? Well, one way is to divide 57 by 160 directly. Let me try doing that long division. So 57 divided by 160. Since 160 goes into 57 zero times, we put a decimal point and add a zero, making it 570. Let me recall how long division works.\n\nSo 160 into 570. Let me figure out how many times 160 fits into 570. 160 times 3 is 480, which is less than 570. 160 times 4 is 640, which is too big. So 3 times. Subtract 480 from 570, which gives 90. Bring down another zero, making it 900.\n\nNow, how many times does 160 go into 900? Let me calculate. 160 times 5 is 800. 160 times 5 is 800. Subtract 800 from 900, that leaves 100. Bring down another zero, making it 1000.\n\nHow many times does 160 go into 1000? Let me see. 160 times 6 is 960. 160 times 6 is 960. Subtract that from 1000, we get 40. Bring down another zero, making it 400.\n\nNow, how many times does 160 go into 400? 160 times 2 is 320, which is less than 400. 160 times 2 is 320. Subtract that from 400, we get 80. Bring down another zero, making it 800.\n\nHow many times does 160 go into 800? Well, 160 times 5 is 800. Subtract that, we get zero. So the division ends here. Let me write down the decimal places step by step.\n\nStarting with 57 divided by 160:\n\n- First step: 0.\n- After first division: 0.3 (since we had 3)\n- Remainder 90, then divided into 900 gave us 5, so 0.35\n- Remainder 100, divided into 1000 gave us 6, so 0.356\n- Remainder 40, divided into 400 gave us 2, so 0.3562\n- Remainder 80, divided into 800 gave us 5, so 0.35625\n- Then remainder zero, so it terminates here.\n\nTherefore, 57/160 as a decimal is 0.35625. Let me check if that makes sense. Let me verify by multiplying 0.35625 by 160 to see if I get 57.\n\nCalculating 0.35625 * 160:\n\nFirst, 0.35625 * 100 = 35.625\n\nThen, 0.35625 * 60 = ?\n\nWell, 0.35625 * 60. Let me break it down:\n\n0.35625 * 60 = (0.35625 * 6) * 10\n\n0.35625 * 6:\n\nMultiply 0.35625 by 6:\n\n0.35625 * 6:\n\nLet me do 0.3 * 6 = 1.8\n\n0.05 * 6 = 0.3\n\n0.00625 * 6 = 0.0375\n\nAdding those together: 1.8 + 0.3 = 2.1 + 0.0375 = 2.1375\n\nMultiply by 10: 21.375\n\nSo total is 35.625 + 21.375 = 57. Perfect! So that checks out. Therefore, 0.35625 is indeed equal to 57/160.\n\nAlternatively, another way to convert the fraction is to adjust the denominator to a power of 10. Since the denominator is 160, which factors into 2^5 * 5^1, as I had earlier. To make it a power of 10, which is 2*5, we need to have equal exponents for 2 and 5. The highest exponent here is 5 for 2, so we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(5-1) = 5^4 to make the denominator 2^5 * 5^5 = (2*5)^5 = 10^5 = 100000.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me explain. The denominator is 2^5 * 5^1. To convert this into a power of 10, we need to have the same number of 2s and 5s. Since there are 5 2s and 1 5, we need to multiply by 5^4 to make the denominator 2^5 * 5^5, which is 10^5. Therefore, multiplying numerator and denominator by 5^4:\n\nNumerator: 57 * 5^4\n\nDenominator: 160 * 5^4 = 10^5\n\nLet me compute 5^4. 5^2 is 25, 5^3 is 125, 5^4 is 625. Therefore, multiplying numerator and denominator by 625:\n\nNumerator: 57 * 625. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 57 * 600 = 34,200\n\nThen 57 * 25 = 1,425\n\nAdding them together: 34,200 + 1,425 = 35,625\n\nTherefore, the numerator is 35,625 and the denominator is 10^5, which is 100,000.\n\nTherefore, 35,625 / 100,000 is 0.35625. Yep, same result as before. So that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way by breaking down the fraction first? Let me see. Maybe simplifying 57/160? But 57 and 160, do they have any common factors? Let me check. 57 factors into 3*19. 160 is 2^5*5. No common factors, so the fraction is already in simplest terms. Therefore, no simplification needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert 57/160 by breaking it into parts. For example, 57 divided by 160 is the same as (57 divided by 16) divided by 10. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, compute 57 divided by 16. 16*3=48, 16*3.5=56. So 57 divided by 16 is 3.5625. Then divide by 10, so 0.35625. Oh, that's a quicker way. Because 57/160 = 57/(16*10) = (57/16)/10. And since 57 divided by 16 is 3.5625, then dividing by 10 moves the decimal one place left to 0.35625. That's clever.\n\nSo that's another way to think about it. Since 1/16 is 0.0625, so 57/16 is 57 * 0.0625. Wait, no, 1/16 is 0.0625, so 57/16 is 57 * (1/16) = 57 * 0.0625. Let me compute that.\n\n57 * 0.0625. Well, 0.0625 is 1/16, so 57*(1/16) = 57/16 = 3.5625 as before. So yeah, same thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking 57 into parts that are easier to divide by 160. For instance, 57 can be thought of as 48 + 9. 48/160 is 0.3, since 48 divided by 160 is 0.3 (because 48/160 = 3/10). Then 9/160. Let me calculate 9 divided by 160. Well, 9/160. Let me do 9 divided by 160. Since 1/160 is approximately 0.00625, so 9 times that is 0.05625. Then adding 0.3 + 0.05625 gives 0.35625. That works too. So that's another method.\n\nSo multiple ways to approach this problem. All leading to the same decimal, 0.35625. Therefore, I can be confident that 57/160 as a terminating decimal is 0.35625. Let me just check once more with another method. Maybe using decimal equivalents of fractions.\n\nAlternatively, since 1/160 is 0.00625 (because 1/10 is 0.1, 1/100 is 0.01, etc., but maybe better to calculate). Let me compute 1 divided by 160. 1/16 is 0.0625, so 1/160 is half of that, which is 0.03125? Wait, no. Wait, 1/16 is 0.0625. Then 1/160 is 1/(16*10) = (1/16)/10 = 0.0625 / 10 = 0.00625. Yes, that's right. Therefore, 1/160 is 0.00625. Therefore, 57/160 is 57 * 0.00625.\n\nLet me compute 57 * 0.00625. Let me think. 0.00625 is 6.25 * 10^-3. Alternatively, 57 * 6.25 * 10^-3. Let me compute 57 * 6.25 first.\n\nWell, 57 * 6 = 342, 57 * 0.25 = 14.25. Adding them together: 342 + 14.25 = 356.25. Then multiply by 10^-3: 356.25 * 10^-3 = 0.35625. Yep, same result. So that's another confirmation.\n\nTherefore, all methods lead to the same decimal. So I think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any mistakes in my calculations. The cross-checks all worked out. Multiplying 0.35625 by 160 gives 57, which confirms it. Breaking down the fraction in different ways also gives the same decimal. Therefore, I can conclude that 57/160 as a terminating decimal is 0.35625.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe terminating decimal equivalent of $\\frac{57}{160}$ is \\boxed{0.35625}.\n</think>"}
