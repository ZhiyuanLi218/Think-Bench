So, the question is about the periodic table and some elements W, X, Y, Z. We need to find the incorrect statement among the options A to D. The given information is that the sum of the highest valences of W and X is 8. Also, they are short-period main group elements, meaning they are in periods 1-3, I think.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of the periodic table. Short-period main group elements would be in groups 1, 2, 13-18 (which are the s-block and p-block elements). The highest valence of an element is usually equal to its group number minus 10 for p-block elements (except for oxygen and fluorine, which have lower valences). For example, group 1 elements have +1 valence, group 2 +2, group 13 +3, group 14 +4, group 15 can have +3 or +5 (but highest is +5?), group 16 +6, group 17 +7, group 18 are noble gases with 0 valence. Wait, but for main group elements, the highest valence is usually the group number minus 8? Or maybe group number for s-block and group minus 10 for p-block? Let me get this straight.\n\nActually, for main group elements, the highest oxidation state is typically equal to the number of valence electrons, which for group 1 is 1, group 2 is 2, groups 13-17, it's 3-7. So group 13 is +3, group 14 +4, group 15 +5, group 16 +6, group 17 +7. So if the sum of the highest valences of W and X is 8, then possible combinations could be:\n\n- If W is group 1 (+1) and X is group 7 (+7): 1+7=8\n\n- W group 2 (+2) and X group 6 (+6): 2+6=8\n\n- W group 3 (+3) and X group 5 (+5): 3+5=8\n\n- W group 4 (+4) and X group 4: 4+4=8? But that would be same group, but sum is 8. Wait, but 4+4=8? That's possible if they are in group 14. But are they different elements? Maybe.\n\nBut since they are short-period main group elements, let's think about their positions. Also, the problem says that the table is a part of the periodic table, but we don't have the actual table. So maybe the positions of W, X, Y, Z in the table can be inferred from the given information?\n\nWait, the problem mentions that W, X, Y, Z are short-period main group elements. So they are in periods 1, 2, or 3. Also, since they are main group elements, they are in groups 1, 2, 13-18.\n\nBut without seeing the table, how can we determine their positions? Maybe the table is arranged in the standard way, so maybe W, X, Y, Z are adjacent elements or in a certain group or period. Wait, the problem mentions \"the table is a part of the periodic table of elements\", so perhaps the elements are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other can be inferred from the options. But since we don't have the actual table, maybe the question is expecting us to use the given information (sum of highest valences of W and X is 8) and the options to figure out which one is incorrect.\n\nLet me consider the possible combinations again. Let's list possible pairs for W and X where their highest valences add to 8.\n\nCase 1: W is group 1 (valence +1), X is group 7 (valence +7). For example, sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). But since they are short-period, group 1 elements in short periods are H, Li, Na (but Na is in period 3). Similarly, group 7 in short periods are F (period 2), Cl (period 3). So possible pairs could be Li (group 1, +1) and Cl (group 17, +7) or Na and Cl, or Li and F.\n\nCase 2: W group 2 (+2) and X group 6 (+6). For example, Mg (group 2, +2) and S (group 16, +6). Or Be and O? But oxygen's highest valence is +6? Wait, oxygen is in group 16. The highest oxidation state for oxygen is usually +2, but in some compounds like OF2, it's +2. However, typically, oxygen's highest common oxidation state is -2, but in terms of maximum positive oxidation state, maybe +2. But for sulfur, it can have +6. So if X is in group 16, its highest valence is +6. If W is group 2, then valence is +2, so sum is 8. So this case is possible.\n\nCase 3: W group 3 (+3) and X group 5 (+5). For example, B (group 13, +3) and N (group 15, +5). Or Al and P. Since they are short-period, group 13 elements in periods 2-3 are B (period 2) and Al (period 3). Group 15 in short periods are N (period 2), P (period 3). So possible pairs: B and N, Al and P.\n\nCase 4: W group 4 (+4) and X group 4? Wait, if both are group 14, their valence would be +4 each, sum is 8. But same group. For example, C and Si, or Si and Ge (but Ge is in period 4, which is not short-period). So possible if W and X are both in group 14. But the problem states that the sum of their highest valences is 8, so 4+4=8. But since they are different elements, maybe they are in the same group but different periods. However, the problem says they are short-period, so group 14 elements in short periods are C (period 2), Si (period 3). So possible pair: C and Si. But then their valence sum is 4+4=8. So that's another case.\n\nSo possible cases for W and X:\n\n1. Group 1 and 17 (valence +1 and +7)\n\n2. Group 2 and 16 (+2 and +6)\n\n3. Group 13 and 15 (+3 and +5)\n\n4. Group 14 and 14 (+4 and +4)\n\nNow, the problem also mentions elements Y and Z. But since the table is not provided, maybe the positions of Y and Z can be inferred from the options? Let's look at the options.\n\nOption A: Atomic radius: W < X. So depends on their positions. If W and X are in the same period, then atomic radius decreases across a period. So if W is to the left of X, then W has a smaller atomic radius. If they are in different periods, it depends.\n\nOption B: At room temperature and pressure, the simple substance of Y is solid. So Y could be a metal or a nonmetal that is solid. For example, if Y is in group 14 (like carbon as diamond, or silicon), or group 15 (like phosphorus, but white phosphorus is solid), or group 16 (sulfur, solid), or group 17 (iodine, solid). Or metals like Na, Mg, Al.\n\nOption C: Thermal stability of gaseous hydride: Z < W. So if Z's hydride is less stable than W's. For example, if Z is in a lower period than W in the same group, since thermal stability decreases down the group. For example, NH3 (N is in period 2) is more stable than PH3 (P in period 3).\n\nOption D: The hydrated oxide of X's highest valence is a strong base. If X is a metal, then its highest oxide is basic. For example, if X is in group 1 or 2, then their oxides are basic. If X is in group 13, like Al, then Al2O3 is amphoteric. If X is in group 14, like Sn or Pb, but they are not short-period. For short-period group 14, like C or Si, their oxides are acidic or neutral. So if X is a metal with high electropositivity, then its oxide would be a strong base.\n\nNow, let's try to figure out which case for W and X is possible, and then check the options.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each case for W and X:\n\nCase 1: W is group 1 (e.g., Li, Na) and X is group 17 (e.g., F, Cl). Let's assume W is in group 1 and X in group 17. If they are in the same period, say period 2: W is Li (group 1, period 2), X is F (group 17, period 2). Then atomic radius: Li (atomic radius ~152 pm) vs F (~64 pm). Wait, but Li is in group 1, period 2. F is in group 17, period 2. Atomic radius decreases across a period. So Li has a larger radius than F. Wait, so in this case, W (Li) would have a larger radius than X (F). But option A says W < X, which would be incorrect here. However, if they are in different periods. Suppose W is Na (period 3, group 1) and X is Cl (period 3, group 17). Then atomic radius of Na (~186 pm) is larger than Cl (~99 pm). So again, W > X. But if W is in a lower period than X? For example, W is Li (period 2) and X is Cl (period 3). Then Li's radius is ~152 pm vs Cl ~99 pm. Still W > X. Wait, but if W is in group 1, period 2 (Li) and X is in group 17, period 3 (Cl). Then Li is in a higher period than Cl? No, period 2 vs 3. Period 3 is lower. So Li is in period 2, Cl in period 3. The atomic radius increases down a group. But comparing Li (period 2) and Cl (period 3). Since Cl is in period 3, but group 17. The atomic radius of Cl is smaller than that of K (group 1, period 4), but larger than that of F (period 2). However, Li is in period 2, group 1. Cl is in period 3, group 17. So Li is in the same period as B, C, etc., while Cl is in period 3. The atomic radius of Cl is larger than that of F (period 2), but smaller than that of Ar (same period). However, comparing Li (period 2, group 1) and Cl (period 3, group 17). Which one has a larger atomic radius? The atomic radius increases down a group and decreases across a period. So Li is in period 2, Cl in period 3. But Cl is further to the right in its period. So Li is in period 2, group 1. Cl is in period 3, group 17. The atomic radius of Cl is larger than that of elements in period 2 (like F), but smaller than elements in period 3 to the left of Cl. For example, atomic radius of Na (period 3, group 1) is larger than Mg (group 2), Al (group 13), Si (group 14), P (group 15), S (group 16), Cl (group 17). So Cl has a smaller atomic radius than Na. Therefore, if W is Li (period 2, group 1) and X is Cl (period 3, group 17), then Li has a larger atomic radius than Cl. Therefore, in this case, option A (W < X) would be incorrect. However, if W is in group 1, period 3 (Na) and X is in group 17, period 3 (Cl), then Na has a larger atomic radius than Cl. So again, option A would be incorrect. But if W is in group 1, period 1 (H) and X is in group 17, period 2 (F). Then H has a smaller atomic radius than F? Wait, H is in period 1, group 1. F is in period 2, group 17. The atomic radius of H is about 53 pm, F is about 64 pm. So in this case, W (H) has a smaller radius than X (F). So option A would be correct here. But H is a short-period element (period 1). However, the problem says W, X, Y, Z are short-period main group elements. So H is allowed. So in this case, if W is H and X is F, then their highest valences are +1 and +7 (for H, highest is +1; for F, highest is +7? Wait, fluorine's highest oxidation state is +7? Actually, fluorine typically shows -1 oxidation state, but in some compounds like in F2O, it's -1. Wait, fluorine is the most electronegative element and usually doesn't show positive oxidation states except in some rare cases. Wait, actually, fluorine's highest oxidation state is 0 in F2, but in compounds, it's usually -1. However, in some oxyfluorides like ClF3, F is -1. So maybe fluorine's highest valence is considered as -1? But the question mentions the sum of the highest valences of W and X is 8. If X is fluorine, then its highest valence is +7? But that's not typical. Wait, this might be a problem. Maybe the question is considering the highest positive oxidation state? For example, for group 17 elements, the highest positive oxidation state is +7 (for Cl, Br, I), but fluorine cannot achieve +7 because it doesn't have d-orbitals. So if X is fluorine, then its highest valence is +7? No, fluorine can't have +7. Therefore, if X is in group 17, its highest valence is +7 only if it's Cl, Br, I. But fluorine's highest oxidation state is +1? Wait, in some compounds like HOF, fluorine is in +1 oxidation state. The highest oxidation state for fluorine is +1. So if X is F, then its highest valence is +1. Therefore, if W and X are in group 1 and 17, but X is F, then their valence sum would be +1 (W) + +1 (X) = 2, which is not 8. Therefore, the pair W (group 1) and X (group 17) must be such that X is Cl or Br or I. But since they are short-period, X can only be Cl (period 3) or F (period 2). But F's highest valence is not +7. Therefore, maybe this case is invalid unless X is Cl. So if W is in group 1, and X is Cl (group 17, period 3), then their highest valences are +1 and +7, sum 8. So that works. Then W could be Na (group 1, period 3) and X is Cl (group 17, period 3). In this case, atomic radius of Na is larger than Cl, so option A (W < X) is incorrect. But if W is Li (group 1, period 2) and X is Cl (group 17, period 3), then Li's radius is larger than Cl's. So again, option A is incorrect. However, if W is H (group 1, period 1) and X is Cl (group 17, period 3), then H's radius is smaller than Cl's. So option A would be correct here. But H's highest valence is +1, and Cl's is +7, sum is 8. So in this case, option A is correct. Therefore, depending on which elements W and X are, option A could be correct or incorrect. So we need more information.\n\nCase 2: W is group 2 and X is group 16. Let's take examples. For example, W is Mg (group 2, period 3) and X is S (group 16, period 3). Highest valences: Mg is +2, S is +6, sum 8. Atomic radius: Mg has a larger radius than S because in the same period, atomic radius decreases. So Mg (radius ~160 pm) vs S (~104 pm). So W > X, so option A (W < X) is incorrect. If W is Be (group 2, period 2) and X is O (group 16, period 2). Highest valences: Be +2, O +6? Wait, oxygen's highest oxidation state is +6? In some compounds like O2PtF6, but typically, oxygen's highest common oxidation state is -2. However, the question mentions the highest valence, which for group 16 would be +6. So assuming that, then Be +2 and O +6 sum to 8. But oxygen's highest valence is +6? Maybe in some compounds. So if W is Be and X is O, then their atomic radii: Be (~112 pm) vs O (~66 pm). So Be > O, so option A (W < X) is incorrect. If W is Ca, but Ca is in period 4, which is not short-period. So W must be Be, Mg. So again, option A would be incorrect here. However, if W is in group 2, period 3 (Mg) and X is in group 16, period 3 (S), same period, so W has larger radius than X. So option A is incorrect. But if W and X are in different periods? Suppose W is Mg (period 3, group 2) and X is O (period 2, group 16). Then Mg is in a lower period than O. The atomic radius of Mg is larger than O. So again, W > X. So option A is incorrect. So in this case, option A is incorrect.\n\nCase 3: W group 13 (+3) and X group 15 (+5). Sum is 8. For example, W is B (group 13, period 2) and X is N (group 15, period 2). Their highest valences are +3 and +5. Sum 8. Atomic radius: B is larger than N? In period 2, atomic radius decreases from left to right. So B (group 13) has larger radius than N (group 15). So W > X. So option A (W < X) is incorrect. If W is Al (group 13, period 3) and X is P (group 15, period 3). Same period, so Al > P in atomic radius. So again, option A is incorrect. If W is B (period 2) and X is P (period 3). Then B is in period 2, X in period 3. The atomic radius of P is larger than B? Let's check. B's atomic radius is ~87 pm (wait, no, wait for exact numbers). Wait, atomic radius of B is approximately 87 pm (covalent radius?), while P is about 106 pm. So yes, P has larger radius than B. So if W is B (period 2, group 13) and X is P (period 3, group 15), then W's radius is smaller than X's. So option A (W < X) would be correct here. So in this case, option A is correct. So depending on the positions, option A can be correct or incorrect. So this case is possible.\n\nCase 4: W and X both in group 14, each with +4 valence. Sum is 8. For example, W is C (group 14, period 2) and X is Si (group 14, period 3). Atomic radius: Si is larger than C. So W (C) < X (Si). So option A would be correct here. If they are in the same period? Not possible since group 14 in same period would be same element. So they must be in different periods. So in this case, option A is correct.\n\nSo now, depending on which case we are in, option A can be correct or incorrect. Therefore, we need more clues from the other options to figure out which case applies.\n\nLooking at the other options:\n\nOption B: At room temperature and pressure, the simple substance of Y is solid. If Y is in a certain position. For example, if Y is a metal like Na, Mg, Al, then it's solid. If Y is a nonmetal like sulfur, phosphorus, iodine, it's solid. If Y is a gas (like O2, N2, Cl2), then it's not solid. So depends on Y's position.\n\nOption C: Thermal stability of gaseous hydride: Z < W. For example, if Z is below W in the same group, then Z's hydride is less stable. Like NH3 (N in period 2) is more stable than PH3 (P in period 3).\n\nOption D: The hydrated oxide of X's highest valence is a strong base. If X is a metal, then its highest oxide is basic. For example, if X is in group 1 or 2, then their oxides are strong bases. If X is in group 13 (like Al), then Al2O3 is amphoteric. If X is in group 14 (like Si), then SiO2 is acidic. So if X is a metal, then D could be correct.\n\nNow, let's try to consider each case and see which options hold.\n\nFirst, let's consider Case 1: W group 1 and X group 17. For example, W=Na (group 1, period 3) and X=Cl (group 17, period 3). Then Y and Z are other elements in the table. Since the table is a part of the periodic table, maybe they are adjacent to W and X. But without the table, this is speculative. However, maybe we can consider possible positions.\n\nIf W is in group 1, period 3 (Na) and X in group 17, period 3 (Cl), then maybe Y and Z are in adjacent groups. For example, Y could be in group 2, period 3 (Mg), or group 16, period 3 (S), etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nOption B: Y's simple substance is solid. If Y is Mg (solid), S (solid), then yes. So B could be correct.\n\nOption C: Z's hydride is less stable than W's. If Z is in the same group as W but lower period, then Z's hydride is less stable. For example, if W is Na (group 1), but group 1 hydrides are not typical (NaH is ionic). Maybe Z is in another group. Alternatively, if Z is in group 16, and W is in group 17? Not sure. This case is too vague without knowing Y and Z positions.\n\nOption D: Hydrated oxide of X (Cl) is a strong base. X is Cl, highest oxide is Cl2O7, which is an acidic oxide (since Cl is nonmetal), so its hydrated form is HClO4 (perchloric acid), which is a strong acid, not a base. Therefore, option D would be incorrect here. But the question asks for the incorrect statement. So if in this case, option D is incorrect, but if in another case, D is correct.\n\nBut in this case (W=Na, X=Cl), option D is incorrect. So if the correct answer is D, then maybe this is the case. But we need to check other options.\n\nBut in this case, option A (W < X) is incorrect because Na has larger radius than Cl. So if option A is incorrect, but the question asks for the incorrect statement, then if the incorrect statement is among the options, we need to see which one is incorrect. However, since the question says \"the incorrect statement is ( )\", meaning one of the options is incorrect, and we need to find which one.\n\nBut since different cases lead to different incorrect options, we need to find which case is valid based on the options.\n\nLet me consider Case 2: W group 2 and X group 16. For example, W=Mg (group 2, period 3) and X=S (group 16, period 3). Then the highest oxide of X (S) is SO3, which is acidic (H2SO4 is sulfuric acid). So option D says the hydrated oxide is a strong base, which would be incorrect. So in this case, option D is incorrect. Also, option A (W < X) is incorrect because Mg has larger radius than S. So if both A and D are incorrect, but the question says only one incorrect option. So this suggests that this case may not be the correct one.\n\nCase 3: W group 13 and X group 15. For example, W=Al (group 13, period 3) and X=P (group 15, period 3). Their highest valences are +3 and +5, sum 8. The hydrated oxide of X (P) would be... X's highest oxide is P2O5, which is acidic (H3PO4 is phosphoric acid), so its hydrated oxide is an acid, not a base. So option D would be incorrect here. Also, atomic radius of W (Al) vs X (P): Al has larger radius than P, so option A (W < X) is incorrect. Again, multiple options incorrect, which may not be the case.\n\nCase 4: W and X both group 14. For example, W=C (group 14, period 2) and X=Si (group 14, period 3). Sum of valences 4+4=8. The hydrated oxide of X (Si) is SiO2, which is acidic (silicic acid is weak), but if X is in group 14 and is a metalloid, its oxide is amphoteric or acidic. So the hydrated oxide of X's highest valence is not a strong base. So option D is incorrect. Atomic radius: W=C < X=Si, so option A is correct. So in this case, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo in cases 1, 2, 3, 4, option D can be incorrect. Also, in cases 1, 2, 3, option A is incorrect. But the question states that only one of the options is incorrect. Therefore, we need to find which case is compatible with the options given.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: The hydrated oxide of X's highest valence is a strong base. If this is incorrect, then X's oxide is not a strong base. Which would be the case if X is a nonmetal or metalloid. If X is a metal in group 1 or 2, then option D would be correct.\n\nSo let's think: if in a case where X is a metal, then option D is correct. So if in a case where X is a metal, then D is correct, and if the incorrect statement is among other options.\n\nLet me check if there is any case where X is a metal.\n\nLooking back:\n\nCase 1: X is Cl (nonmetal), so D is incorrect.\n\nCase 2: X is S (nonmetal), D is incorrect.\n\nCase 3: X is P (nonmetal), D is incorrect.\n\nCase 4: X is Si (metalloid), D is incorrect.\n\nSo none of these cases have X as a metal. Wait, but what if in Case 2, X is in group 16 but is a metal? But group 16 in short-period are O (nonmetal), S (nonmetal), and maybe Po (but Po is in period 6, not short-period). So no. Similarly, group 15 in short-period are N, P (nonmetals), As (metalloid, period 4). So no. Group 13 in short-period are B (metalloid), Al (metal). So if in Case 3, X is in group 15, for example, if W is Al (group 13, period 3) and X is P (group 15, period 3). Then X is nonmetal, so D is incorrect. If W is B (group 13, period 2) and X is N (group 15, period 2), X is nonmetal. If W is Al and X is As (but As is period 4, not short-period). So in all cases, X is nonmetal or metalloid, so D is incorrect. Therefore, if the question says that one of the options is incorrect, and D is incorrect in all cases, then maybe D is the incorrect statement. But let's check the other options.\n\nBut the problem is that depending on the case, other options may also be incorrect. For example, in Case 4 (W and X in group 14), option A is correct (W < X), and option D is incorrect. So if in this case, the incorrect statement is D, then D would be the answer. However, we need to check if the other options are correct.\n\nOption B: Y's simple substance is solid. If Y is, say, in group 15, period 3 (P), then solid. If Y is in group 14, period 3 (Si), solid. If Y is in group 16, period 3 (S), solid. So B is likely correct.\n\nOption C: Thermal stability of gaseous hydride: Z < W. If Z is in a lower period than W in the same group. For example, if W is C (period 2) and Z is Si (period 3), then CH4 is more stable than SiH4. So yes, C would be correct.\n\nSo in Case 4, options A is correct, B is correct, C is correct, D is incorrect. Therefore, the incorrect statement is D. Hence, the answer would be D.\n\nBut let's check another case where D is incorrect but other options are correct.\n\nIn Case 1: W=H (group 1, period 1), X=F (group 17, period 2). But F's highest valence is +1? No, earlier we saw that fluorine's highest oxidation state is +1. Wait, if W is H (+1) and X is F (+1), sum is 2, not 8. So invalid. So Case 1 must be W=Na (group 1, period 3) and X=Cl (group 17, period 3). In this case, option D is incorrect (since X=Cl's oxide is acidic), option A is incorrect (W=Na has larger radius than X=Cl). So both A and D are incorrect, which conflicts with the question having only one incorrect option. Hence, this case may not be valid.\n\nBut the question says that the sum of the highest valences is 8. For W=Na (+1) and X=Cl (+7), sum is 8. But earlier I thought fluorine's highest valence is +1, but chlorine's is +7. So if X is Cl, then it's valid. So in this case, option A is incorrect (W=Na > X=Cl in radius), and option D is incorrect (X's oxide is acidic). But the question says only one of the options is incorrect, so this case may not be the correct one.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct case is Case 4, where only D is incorrect. Let's verify again.\n\nCase 4: W and X are both group 14. Let's take W=C (period 2) and X=Si (period 3). Sum of valences is 4+4=8. Atomic radius: C < Si, so option A is correct. Option B: Y's simple substance is solid. If Y is in the same period as X (period 3), maybe Y is P, S, Cl, Ar, but if the table includes elements around Si, like Al, P, then Y could be Al (solid), P (solid), etc. So B is correct. Option C: Thermal stability of gaseous hydride: Z < W. If Z is in the same group as W but lower period. For example, if Z=Si and W=C, then SiH4 is less stable than CH4. So if Z is Si and W is C, then yes, C's hydride is more stable. So option C is correct. Option D: The hydrated oxide of X's highest valence is a strong base. X is Si, highest oxide is SiO2, which forms H2SiO3 (silicic acid), which is a weak acid. Therefore, option D is incorrect. Hence, in this case, only D is incorrect, which matches the question's requirement. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities in Case 4. For example, if W is Si and X is Ge, but Ge is not short-period. So no. So W and X must be C and Si.\n\nAnother check: if W is Si and X is C, but the sum is still 4+4=8. But then W would be Si and X is C. But the question says the sum of the highest valences of W and X is 8. It doesn't specify which is which. So if W is Si and X is C, same thing. But atomic radius of Si > C, so option A (W < X) would be incorrect if W is Si and X is C. But in this case, the problem would have W and X as Si and C. But the question's options are about W and X. However, the problem says \"the sum of the highest valences of W and X is 8\", so it doesn't matter which is which. But in our earlier analysis, we assumed W and X are in group 14 with W in period 2 and X in period 3. But if it's reversed, then option A would be incorrect. However, the question's options are fixed. So if the correct case is W=C and X=Si, then option A is correct. If it's W=Si and X=C, then option A is incorrect. But since the problem doesn't specify the order in the table, but the options are fixed, we need to assume that the correct case is where option A is correct, leading to D being the incorrect option.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\nBut let's check another angle. Suppose the correct case is Case 3 where W is group 13 and X is group 15, for example, W=Al (group 13, period 3) and X=P (group 15, period 3). Then:\n\nOption A: Atomic radius of Al vs P. Al has larger radius than P, so W > X, so option A (W < X) is incorrect.\n\nOption D: X is P, highest oxide is P2O5, which forms H3PO4 (phosphoric acid), so not a base. Hence, D is incorrect.\n\nSo in this case, both A and D are incorrect, which contradicts the question's setup. Hence, this case is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only case where only one option is incorrect is Case 4 (group 14 elements), leading to option D being incorrect.\n\nAnother check for option C: Thermal stability of gaseous hydride: Z < W. If Z is in the same group as W but lower period. For example, if W is C (CH4) and Z is Si (SiH4), then CH4 is more stable than SiH4, so option C says Z < W, which is correct. Hence, option C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
