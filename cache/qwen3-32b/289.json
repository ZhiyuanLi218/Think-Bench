Let me start by recalling some physics concepts here.\n\nFirst, if the object is stationary on the equator and there's no pressure, that probably means that the gravitational force is exactly providing the centripetal force needed for the object to stay in circular motion due to the celestial body's rotation. If there was pressure, that would imply there's a normal force, but since there isn't, the gravitational pull is just enough to keep it moving in a circle. So, the gravitational acceleration must equal the centripetal acceleration.\n\nLet me write that down. The gravitational force on the object is given by Newton's law of gravitation: F_grav = (G * M * m) / R², where M is the mass of the celestial body, m is the object's mass, and R is the radius of the celestial body.\n\nBut the centripetal force required for circular motion is F_centrifugal = m * ω² * R, where ω is the angular velocity. Since these two forces balance each other (because the object is just about to lift off, so normal force is zero), I can set them equal:\n\nG * M * m / R² = m * ω² * R\n\nSimplify this equation by dividing both sides by m:\n\nG * M / R² = ω² * R\n\nThen, multiplying both sides by R² and dividing by ω²:\n\nG * M = ω² * R³\n\nSo, ω² = G * M / R³\n\nBut ω is related to the rotation period T by ω = 2π / T. Let me substitute that in:\n\n(2π / T)² = G * M / R³\n\nExpanding that:\n\n4π² / T² = G * M / R³\n\nSolving for T²:\n\nT² = (4π² * R³) / (G * M)\n\nTherefore, T = 2π * sqrt(R³ / (G * M))\n\nOkay, so that's the formula for the rotation period. But the problem gives me the average density ρ of the celestial body instead of its mass or radius. I need to express T in terms of ρ and G.\n\nThe average density ρ is mass over volume. Since the celestial body is spherical, its volume is (4/3)πR³. Therefore:\n\nρ = M / [(4/3)πR³]\n\nSolving for M:\n\nM = ρ * (4/3)πR³\n\nSo substituting this into the expression for T:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt(R³ / (G * (4/3)πR³)) )\n\nLet me simplify inside the square root. The R³ in numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nsqrt(1 / (G * (4/3)π)) ) = sqrt(3 / (4πGρ))\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me write the substitution step-by-step.\n\nOriginal expression after substitution:\n\nsqrt(R³ / (G * M)) becomes sqrt(R³ / [G * (4/3)πR³ * ρ]) )\n\nYes, because M = (4/3)πR³ρ. Therefore:\n\nInside sqrt: R³ divided by [G*(4/3)πR³ρ] equals 1 divided by [G*(4/3)πρ], so:\n\nsqrt(1 / [ (4/3)πGρ ]) = 1 / sqrt( (4/3)πGρ )\n\nTherefore, T = 2π / sqrt( (4/3)πGρ )\n\nLet me simplify that expression. Let's write it as:\n\nT = 2π / [ sqrt(4πGρ/3) ) ] = 2π / [ (sqrt(4πGρ)/sqrt(3)) ) ] = 2π * sqrt(3) / sqrt(4πGρ)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(π):\n\nWait, let me handle constants first. Let me write:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt(3) / sqrt(4πGρ) = 2π * sqrt(3) / [ sqrt(4) * sqrt(πGρ) ) ] = 2π * sqrt(3) / [ 2 * sqrt(πGρ) ) ]\n\nCancel 2 in numerator and denominator:\n\nT = π * sqrt(3) / sqrt(πGρ) = π * sqrt(3) / [ sqrt(π) * sqrt(Gρ) ) ] = sqrt(π) * sqrt(3) / sqrt(Gρ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt(3π/(Gρ)) ?\n\nWait, let me square T to check:\n\nT² = [ π² * 3 ] / [ π G ρ ] = (3 π²) / (π G ρ) ) = 3π / (Gρ)\n\nTherefore, T = sqrt( 3π / (Gρ) )\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal expression after substitution:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt(3/(4πGρ)) ?\n\nWait, let me re-express T:\n\nEarlier step:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt( 3 / (4πGρ) )\n\nYes, because:\n\nInside the sqrt was 3/(4πGρ). Let me verify:\n\nWe had sqrt(3/(4πGρ)) multiplied by 2π. Let me square T:\n\nT² = (2π)² * [ 3 / (4πGρ) ) ] = 4π² * 3 / (4πGρ) ) = (12 π²) / (4 π G ρ) ) = 3 π / (G ρ )\n\nTherefore, T = sqrt( 3 π / ( G ρ ) )\n\nWhich is sqrt(3π/(Gρ)).\n\nLooking at the options, option D is sqrt( 3π / (Gρ) ), which is exactly what I have here. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) (4π/(3Gρ))^(1/2)\n\n(B) (3/(4πGρ))^(1/2)\n\n(C) (π/(Gρ))^(1/2)\n\n(D) (3π/(Gρ))^(1/2)\n\nYes, so my result is sqrt(3π/(Gρ)), which is option D. Therefore, answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in substitution.\n\nOriginal formula for T was T = 2π * sqrt(R³/(GM)).\n\nThen, since M = (4/3)πR³ρ, substituting into T:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt( R³ / [ G*(4/3)πR³ρ ] )\n\nYes, R³ cancels, so inside sqrt is 1/[ (4/3)πGρ ].\n\nTherefore sqrt(3/(4πGρ)) multiplied by 2π:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt(3/(4πGρ)) = 2π * sqrt(3)/sqrt(4πGρ) = 2π * sqrt(3) / [ 2 sqrt(πGρ) ) ] = π * sqrt(3)/sqrt(πGρ) = sqrt(π² * 3 / (π G ρ)) ) = sqrt( 3 π / (G ρ) )\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to think about this. For example, Kepler's law? Wait, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period of a satellite to the radius of its orbit, but here it's about the rotation period of the celestial body itself. But maybe similar math applies because we're equating gravity to centripetal force.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the critical rotation period where gravity is just enough to provide centripetal acceleration, then yes, the derivation is as above.\n\nAnother check: dimensional analysis. Let's check the dimensions of option D. G has dimensions of [M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]. Density ρ is [M L^{-3}]. Therefore, Gρ has dimensions [M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2} * M L^{-3}] = [T^{-2}]. Therefore, 3π/(Gρ) has dimensions of T². Taking square root gives T. So yes, option D is dimensionally correct for a period. The other options?\n\nOption A: (4π/(3Gρ))^{1/2}. Same as D, but with 4π/3 instead of 3π. Let's see, inside the sqrt would be [1/(Gρ)], so dimensions are same. But numerically different.\n\nSimilarly for others. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
