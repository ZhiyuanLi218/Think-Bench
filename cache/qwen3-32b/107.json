Let me start by recalling what alpha decay is. From what I remember, alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay where an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle. An alpha particle is basically a helium nucleus, right? So that would be two protons and two neutrons, which is the same as a helium-4 nucleus. So the symbol for an alpha particle is usually written as He-4 or sometimes as α.\n\nSo in an alpha decay reaction, the original nucleus (parent nucleus) will lose two protons and two neutrons. That means the atomic number (which is the number of protons) decreases by 2, and the mass number (which is protons plus neutrons) decreases by 4. The resulting nucleus is called the daughter nucleus.\n\nNow let me look at each of the options given and see which one fits this description.\n\nStarting with option A: 7^14 N + 2^4 He → 17^O + 1^H. Wait, hold on. The notation here might be a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The parent nucleus is nitrogen-14 (since the atomic number is 7 and mass number 14). It's reacting with helium-4 (which is an alpha particle if this were decay, but here it's being added). The products are oxygen-17 (atomic number 8, mass number 17) and a proton (hydrogen-1, atomic number 1). \n\nHmm. So this looks like a nuclear reaction where an alpha particle is being added to nitrogen, not emitted. So this is probably not an alpha decay. Alpha decay is when the nucleus emits the alpha particle. Here, the alpha particle is a reactant, not a product. So option A is likely not the correct answer. \n\nMoving on to option B: 92^238 U → 90^234 Th + 4 He. Let me check the numbers. The parent nucleus is uranium-238 with atomic number 92. The daughter nucleus is thorium-234 with atomic number 90. The other product is helium-4 (alpha particle). \n\nSo let's verify the numbers. The mass number of uranium is 238. After decay, thorium has 234 and the alpha particle has 4. 234 + 4 = 238, so mass numbers balance. The atomic number of uranium is 92. Thorium has 90, and the alpha particle has 2 (since helium has 2 protons). 90 + 2 = 92, so atomic numbers also balance. This fits exactly the description of alpha decay: the nucleus emits an alpha particle, resulting in a decrease of 2 in atomic number and 4 in mass number. So option B seems like a good candidate for the correct answer.\n\nOption C: 2^1 H + 3^H → 4 He + 1 n. Let me parse this. The reactants are deuterium (hydrogen-2, which is 1 proton + 1 neutron) and tritium (hydrogen-3, 1 proton + 2 neutrons). The products are helium-4 and a neutron. \n\nThis looks like a nuclear fusion reaction, where two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus (helium) and release a neutron. Since alpha decay is about emission of an alpha particle, this is the opposite process—fusion, not decay. So option C is not alpha decay.\n\nOption D: 90^234 Th → 91^234 Pa + -1^0 e. The parent nucleus is thorium-234, and the daughter nucleus is protactinium-234. The other product is a beta particle (electron). \n\nLooking at the numbers: the mass number remains 234 on both sides (234 for Th and 234 for Pa, and the beta particle has 0 mass number). The atomic number of Th is 90, and Pa is 91. The beta particle has a charge of -1, but its atomic number (proton number) would be considered as -1 here. So in beta decay, a neutron converts into a proton, emitting an electron. So atomic number increases by 1, which is what we see here. So this is a beta decay, not alpha decay. Therefore, option D is not the correct answer.\n\nSo going back through the options, only option B involves the emission of an alpha particle (helium nucleus) by the parent nucleus, resulting in a daughter nucleus with lower atomic and mass numbers as expected in alpha decay. The other options involve different processes: option A is a nuclear reaction (probably artificial transmutation), option C is fusion, and option D is beta decay. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n</think>"}
