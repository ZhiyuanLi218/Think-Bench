The Ka of the conjugate acid C₆H₅OH of C₆H₅ONa is 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁰, while the Ka of the conjugate acid CH₃COOH of CH₃COONa is approximately 1.8 × 10⁻⁵. Since Ka(C₆H₅OH) < Ka(CH₃COOH), C₆H₅ONa hydrolyzes to a greater extent and produces more OH⁻. At the same pH, the concentration of C₆H₅ONa must be lower than that of CH₃COONa.

The problem is about phenol, which is a weak acid with a given Ka of 1.0×10⁻¹⁰ at 25°C. There are a few statements provided, and I need to check which ones are correct.\n\nFirst, let me parse the options again. The user mentioned options (a) and (c), but the formatting seems a bit off. Let me try to understand them properly.\n\nOption (a) says: At the same temperature, when the C6H5ON and che3che3c6h solutions have the same concentration, the P of both solutions will increase upon heating. Hmm, the notation here is a bit confusing. \"C6H5ON\" might be a typo or shorthand for something. Maybe it's C6H5OH (phenol) and another compound? The other part is \"che3che3c6h\" which might be a typo for something like CH3CH2C6H...? Not sure. Also, \"P\" probably refers to pH? Because pH is often denoted as P. Maybe the user meant pH? Let me assume that for now.\n\nOption (c) states: At 25°C, when C6H5O solution is mixed with N2O, it's measured that P = 10.00, then the concentration of (C6H5O⁻) is 0.10 mol/L. Adding a small amount of C6H5 only decreases the degree of ionization of water in a 0.10 mol/L C6H5O solution.\n\nFirst, let's tackle option (c), since the other one is a bit confusing with the typos. But maybe I can figure out some parts.\n\nStarting with option (c): The solution is a mixture of C6H5O (phenoxide ion?) and N2O? Wait, N2O is nitrous oxide, a gas. Maybe that's a typo for NaOH or NaO? Since phenoxide ion is the conjugate base of phenol. If they mixed phenoxide with something... Maybe it's a buffer solution? If the pH is 10.00, then [H+] is 1.0×10⁻¹⁰. Since phenol has a Ka of 1.0×10⁻¹⁰, that would mean that at pH equal to pKa (since pKa is 10), the concentration of the conjugate base (C6H5O⁻) would be equal to the concentration of the undissociated phenol (C6H5OH). Wait, but if they mixed phenoxide with something... Maybe it's a buffer solution where phenol and its conjugate base are present.\n\nWait, the problem says \"when C6H5O solution is mixed with N2O\". If N2O is a typo for NaOH, then mixing a solution of phenoxide (C6H5O⁻) with NaOH would increase the pH further. However, if the pH is 10.00, which is equal to the pKa of phenol (since Ka is 1.0×10⁻¹⁰, pKa is 10), then according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). If pH = pKa, then log([A⁻]/[HA]) = 0, so [A⁻] = [HA]. Therefore, if the concentration of C6H5O⁻ is 0.10 mol/L, then the concentration of HA (phenol) would also be 0.10 mol/L. But the statement says that [C6H5O⁻] is 0.10 mol/L. So if that's the case, then the total concentration would be 0.20 mol/L? Wait, but the problem says when they mixed the solution, they measured pH 10.00. But if the solution is a mixture of C6H5O⁻ and something else... Maybe it's a buffer solution where phenol is mixed with its conjugate base?\n\nWait, maybe the original solution is of phenol (C6H5OH), and they add something to it? If they mixed a solution of C6H5O⁻ (which is the conjugate base) with N2O... Maybe it's supposed to be NaOH? If you mix a solution of phenoxide (C6H5O⁻) with NaOH, you're adding a strong base, which would increase the pH. However, if the pH is 10.00, which is the pKa, then maybe the solution is a buffer where [A⁻] = [HA]. But if they added NaOH to a solution of phenol, then you would have excess OH⁻, which would shift the equilibrium. Alternatively, if you have a solution of phenoxide (C6H5O⁻) and you mix it with something else... Maybe the problem is that the user made a typo and \"N2O\" is supposed to be NaOH?\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed. If the solution is a buffer where pH = pKa, then [A⁻] = [HA]. So if the measured [A⁻] is 0.10 mol/L, then [HA] is also 0.10 mol/L. But the statement says \"the concentration of (C6H5O⁻) in the solution at this time is 0.10 mol L⁻¹\". That would be correct if the buffer is 0.10 M in both A⁻ and HA. However, if the solution was made by mixing C6H5O⁻ with NaOH, then adding NaOH would increase the concentration of A⁻ and decrease HA. But maybe the problem is not about that. Alternatively, if you have a solution of phenol (C6H5OH) and you add a strong base like NaOH to convert some of it to C6H5O⁻, creating a buffer. Then, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, if pH = pKa, then [A⁻] = [HA]. So if the total concentration is something, but the problem states that [A⁻] is 0.10 mol/L. So if that's the case, then the statement is correct? The problem says \"it is measured that P = 10.00, then the concentration of (C6H5O⁻) in the solution at this time is 0.10 mol L⁻¹\". But if pH = pKa, then [A⁻] = [HA], but the actual concentrations depend on how much you added. For example, if you have 0.10 M A⁻ and 0.10 M HA, then pH is 10.00. But if you have 0.20 M A⁻ and 0.20 M HA, pH is still 10.00. So the concentration of A⁻ could be anything as long as it's equal to HA. Therefore, the statement that [A⁻] is 0.10 mol/L is only correct if the total concentration is 0.20 mol/L (0.10 each), but the problem doesn't specify the total concentration. Therefore, maybe the statement is incorrect because we can't assume the concentration is 0.10 M just based on pH 10.00. Wait, but the problem says \"when C6H5O solution is mixed with N2O...\" Maybe \"C6H5O solution\" is a solution of the conjugate base (C6H5O⁻), and mixing with N2O... If N2O is a typo for NaOH, then adding more NaOH would increase the concentration of OH⁻, but if the pH is 10.00, which is not very basic, maybe it's not NaOH. Alternatively, maybe N2O is a typo for H2O? Not sure. This part is confusing due to possible typos.\n\nThe second part of option (c) says: Adding a small amount of C6H5 only decreases the degree of ionization of water in a 0.10 mol/L C6H5O solution. Wait, C6H5O is the phenoxide ion? If you add phenol (C6H5OH) to a solution of phenoxide (C6H5O⁻), then according to Le Chatelier's principle, it would shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the ionization of the phenoxide. However, the degree of ionization of water... Wait, the phenoxide ion is a weak base, so in solution, it would hydrolyze: C6H5O⁻ + H2O ⇌ C6H5OH + OH⁻. Adding more C6H5OH (phenol) would shift this equilibrium to the left, decreasing the concentration of OH⁻ produced from the hydrolysis of phenoxide. Therefore, the degree of ionization of water would decrease because there's less OH⁻ being produced. Water autoionization is H2O ⇌ H+ + OH⁻, but in the presence of a base, the OH⁻ concentration is mainly from the base hydrolysis. If adding more phenol shifts the hydrolysis equilibrium left, then the [OH⁻] from hydrolysis decreases, so the contribution to water ionization (autoionization) is less. Wait, but the autoionization of water is a separate process. If the solution has a certain pH, then the autoionization is suppressed by the presence of H+ or OH⁻. So if adding phenol decreases the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis, then the overall [OH⁻] would decrease, which would mean that the autoionization of water is less significant compared to the contribution from the base hydrolysis. However, the \"degree of ionization of water\" typically refers to the extent to which water molecules dissociate into H+ and OH⁻. In a solution with excess OH⁻ (from the base hydrolysis), the autoionization of water is suppressed because the product [H+][OH⁻] must equal Kw. If [OH⁻] increases from the base, then [H+] decreases, which would mean that the autoionization of water is less. However, the statement says that adding a small amount of C6H5 (phenol) only decreases the degree of ionization of water. If adding phenol shifts the hydrolysis of phenoxide left, decreasing [OH⁻], then the [H+] would increase slightly. However, since phenol is a very weak acid (Ka 1.0×10⁻¹⁰), the effect might be minimal. Wait, but the solution in question is a 0.10 mol/L C6H5O solution. If that's a solution of phenoxide ion (C6H5O⁻), which is the conjugate base of phenol. The Kb of phenoxide would be Kw/Ka = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ / 1.0×10⁻¹⁰ = 1.0×10⁻⁴. So Kb is 1.0×10⁻⁴. For a 0.10 M solution of C6H5O⁻, the [OH⁻] would be sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(1.0×10⁻⁴ * 0.10) = sqrt(1.0×10⁻⁵) ≈ 3.16×10⁻³ M, so pH ≈ 11.5. If you add a small amount of phenol (C6H5OH), which is the conjugate acid, it would react with the OH⁻ to form more C6H5O⁻ and H2O. Wait, no, the reaction is C6H5O⁻ + H2O ⇌ C6H5OH + OH⁻. Adding C6H5OH would shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the [OH⁻]. Therefore, the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis decreases, which would mean that the contribution to the OH⁻ is less. However, the autoionization of water is H2O ⇌ H+ + OH⁻. The presence of excess OH⁻ from the base hydrolysis suppresses the autoionization. If we decrease the [OH⁻] from the base hydrolysis, then the autoionization of water would contribute a bit more, but since the solution is still basic, the main source of OH⁻ is still the base hydrolysis. However, the \"degree of ionization of water\" is usually very small, and adding phenol would not significantly increase it. Wait, but the statement says that adding a small amount of C6H5 (phenol) only decreases the degree of ionization of water. That seems contradictory. If adding phenol decreases the [OH⁻] from the base hydrolysis, then the solution becomes less basic, so the [H+] increases slightly. The autoionization of water is still suppressed, but perhaps the degree of ionization of water is referring to the extent to which water molecules dissociate. Since the solution's pH is determined mainly by the base hydrolysis, if you decrease the [OH⁻] from that, the [H+] increases, which would mean that the autoionization is still suppressed, but the actual degree of ionization of water (the fraction of water molecules that dissociate) would depend on the [H+] and [OH⁻]. However, since Kw = [H+][OH⁻], if the solution is less basic (lower [OH⁻], higher [H+]), the autoionization is still happening, but the contribution is negligible compared to the added H+ or OH⁻. Therefore, maybe the statement is incorrect? Or maybe the \"degree of ionization of water\" refers to the autoionization being suppressed. If adding phenol decreases the [OH⁻], then the autoionization is less suppressed, so the degree of ionization of water increases. But the statement says it decreases. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think in terms of the autoionization equilibrium. Let's suppose initially, the solution has [OH⁻] from base hydrolysis, say 3.16×10⁻³ M. The autoionization of water would contribute a negligible amount because the solution is already basic. If we add phenol, which shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing [OH⁻], so the solution becomes less basic. Now, the [OH⁻] is lower, so the autoionization of water is less suppressed. However, the actual autoionization would still be minimal because Kw is 1e-14. The degree of ionization of water is the fraction of water molecules that dissociate. In pure water, it's 1.8×10⁻⁷% (since [H+] = 1e-7, so 1e-7 / 55.5 ≈ 1.8e-9). In a solution with higher [OH⁻], the [H+] is lower, so the fraction of water dissociating is lower. If we decrease [OH⁻], then [H+] increases, so the fraction of water dissociating increases slightly. Therefore, adding phenol would actually increase the degree of ionization of water, not decrease it. Therefore, the statement in option (c) that \"adding a small amount of C6H5 only decreases the degree of ionization of water\" is incorrect. Therefore, the second part of option (c) is wrong.\n\nNow, going back to the first part of option (c): if the pH is 10.00, then the [H+] is 1e-10, so [OH⁻] is 1e-4. The solution is a buffer where phenol and its conjugate base are present. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). Here, pH = 10.00, pKa = 10.00, so log([A⁻]/[HA]) = 0 → [A⁻] = [HA]. Therefore, if the total concentration is C = [A⁻] + [HA] = 2[A⁻], then [A⁻] = C/2. However, the problem states that [A⁻] is 0.10 mol/L. So unless C is 0.20 mol/L, this would be true. But the problem doesn't specify the total concentration. However, the problem says \"when C6H5O solution is mixed with N2O...\", which might mean that the original solution is of C6H5O⁻ (phenoxide) and they mixed it with something else. If they mixed it with a strong base like NaOH, then [A⁻] would increase, but [HA] would decrease. However, if the pH is 10.00, which is the pKa, then [A⁻] must equal [HA]. Therefore, if the measured [A⁻] is 0.10 M, then [HA] is also 0.10 M. But how do we know [A⁻] is 0.10 M? Unless the problem provides more information, like the initial concentration of the solutions before mixing. Since the problem doesn't specify, it's unclear. However, the statement says \"the concentration of (C6H5O⁻) in the solution at this time is 0.10 mol L⁻¹\". If the solution is a buffer where [A⁻] = [HA], and the total concentration is 0.20 M, then yes, [A⁻] would be 0.10 M. But without knowing the total concentration, we can't confirm. However, maybe the problem assumes that the solution is 0.10 M in A⁻ and 0.10 M in HA, hence the statement is correct. This is a bit ambiguous, but given the way the question is phrased, maybe it's intended to be correct. However, since the second part of option (c) is incorrect, the entire option (c) might be incorrect.\n\nNow, looking at option (a): At the same temperature, when the C6H5ON and che3che3c6h solutions have the same concentration, the P of both solutions will increase upon heating. Again, the notation is unclear. C6H5ON might be phenol (C6H5OH) or phenoxide? Che3che3c6h is probably a typo for something like CH3CH2C6H... Maybe it's a different compound? For example, maybe it's a sodium salt of phenol (C6H5ONa)? Or perhaps it's a different compound like acetone or something else. The \"P\" likely refers to pH. The statement is saying that when these two solutions have the same concentration, their pH will increase upon heating.\n\nIf we assume that one solution is a weak acid (phenol) and the other is its conjugate base (phenoxide), then heating might affect their dissociation. For weak acids, increasing temperature usually increases the degree of dissociation if the dissociation is endothermic. The dissociation of a weak acid is endothermic, so heating would shift the equilibrium to the right, increasing [H+], decreasing pH. Conversely, for a weak base (phenoxide), heating would also increase the degree of dissociation (endothermic), increasing [OH-], thus increasing pH. However, the problem states that both solutions' pH will increase upon heating. If one is a weak acid and the other is a weak base, then heating the weak acid solution would decrease pH (more H+), and heating the weak base solution would increase pH (more OH-). Therefore, if both solutions are supposed to have increasing pH upon heating, they must both be weak bases or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two solutions are both weak acids, and heating decreases their pH? Or both weak bases. But the notation is unclear. Let's try to guess. If \"C6H5ON\" is a typo for C6H5OH (phenol), a weak acid, and \"che3che3c6h\" is a typo for CH3COOH (acetic acid), another weak acid. If both are weak acids, then heating would increase their dissociation (endothermic), increasing [H+], decreasing pH. But the statement says pH increases. Therefore, this would be incorrect. Alternatively, if one solution is a weak base and the other is a strong base, but the notation is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"C6H5ON\" is a sodium salt of phenol (C6H5ONa), which is a strong base (since phenol is a weak acid), and the other solution is something else. For example, if the other solution is a weak base, then heating might affect their pH. However, without knowing the exact compounds, it's hard to say. Given the confusion in notation, perhaps there's a typo, and the intended compounds are phenol (C6H5OH) and its conjugate base (C6H5O⁻). If both solutions are of the same concentration, one being the acid and the other the base. Upon heating, the acid solution (phenol) would dissociate more (endothermic), increasing [H+], decreasing pH. The base solution (phenoxide) would hydrolyze more, increasing [OH-], increasing pH. Therefore, only the base solution's pH would increase upon heating, while the acid solution's pH would decrease. Therefore, the statement in option (a) that both solutions' pH increase upon heating is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if both solutions are of the same type, like both are weak acids or both are weak bases. For example, if both are weak acids, heating would decrease pH for both. If both are weak bases, heating would increase pH for both. But the problem says \"C6H5ON and che3che3c6h\", which I can't parse. If \"che3che3c6h\" is a typo for CH3COOH (acetic acid), then both phenol and acetic acid are weak acids. Heating would increase their dissociation, decreasing pH. So the statement that pH increases is wrong. Therefore, option (a) is incorrect.\n\nGiven all this, the only part that might be correct is the first part of option (c), but the second part is incorrect. However, the problem might have intended different compounds. Given the confusion in notation, it's possible that the correct answer is option (c), but I need to check again.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nOptions: (a) ... (c) At 25°C, when C6H5O solution is mixed with N2O, it is measured that P = 10.00, then the concentration of (C6H5O⁻) in the solution at this time is 0.10 mol L⁻¹. Adding a small amount of C6H5 only decreases the degree of ionization of water in a 0.10 mol L⁻¹ C6H5O solution.\n\nAssuming that \"C6H5O solution\" is a solution of phenoxide ion (C6H5O⁻), and \"N2O\" is a typo for NaOH. If you mix a solution of phenoxide with NaOH, which is a strong base, then you're adding more OH⁻, which would suppress the hydrolysis of phenoxide. Wait, but if the pH is 10.00, which is the pKa of phenol, then maybe it's a buffer solution. However, adding NaOH to a solution of phenoxide would not create a buffer unless you also have phenol. If you have a solution of phenoxide and add NaOH, you're just increasing the concentration of OH⁻, making the solution more basic. The pH would be determined by the excess OH⁻ from NaOH. However, the problem states that pH is 10.00. If the solution is a buffer where [A⁻] = [HA], then the pH is 10.00. But if you added NaOH to a solution of phenoxide, you would have excess OH⁻, and the pH would be higher than 10.00. Therefore, maybe the mixing is between phenol and NaOH to form a buffer. For example, if you have a solution of phenol (C6H5OH) and add NaOH to it, converting some to C6H5O⁻. Then, the buffer pH would be pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). If pH = 10.00, then [A⁻]/[HA] = 1, so [A⁻] = [HA]. Therefore, if the total concentration is 0.20 M, then [A⁻] = 0.10 M. But the problem doesn't specify the total concentration. However, the statement says that [A⁻] is 0.10 M. If the buffer is made by mixing equal moles of phenol and NaOH, resulting in equal concentrations of A⁻ and HA, then yes, [A⁻] would be 0.10 M if the total concentration is 0.20 M. But without knowing the initial concentrations, we can't confirm. However, the problem states that the solution is made by mixing C6H5O solution with N2O (assuming NaOH), and the pH is 10.00. If the solution is a buffer where [A⁻] = [HA], then [A⁻] = [HA]. If the measured [A⁻] is 0.10 M, then [HA] is also 0.10 M. So the statement is correct in that scenario. Therefore, the first part of option (c) is correct.\n\nThe second part says adding a small amount of C6H5 (phenol) only decreases the degree of ionization of water. As discussed earlier, adding phenol to a solution of phenoxide would decrease the hydrolysis of phenoxide, decreasing [OH⁻], which would mean that the autoionization of water is less suppressed, so the degree of ionization of water increases. Therefore, the statement is incorrect. Hence, only the first part of option (c) is correct, but the option includes both parts. Since the second part is incorrect, the entire option (c) is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, and option (a) also being unclear but likely incorrect, there might be no correct options. But the user might have intended something else. Alternatively, maybe the first part of option (a) is correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf the two solutions are of the same concentration, one being a weak acid (phenol) and the other its conjugate base (phenoxide). Upon heating, the weak acid solution (phenol) will dissociate more (endothermic), increasing [H+], decreasing pH. The weak base solution (phenoxide) will hydrolyze more, increasing [OH-], increasing pH. Therefore, only the base solution's pH increases. The statement says both solutions' pH increase upon heating, which is incorrect. So option (a) is wrong.\n\nTherefore, none of the options (a) and (c) are fully correct. But maybe the user intended option (c) to have only the first part correct, but since it's combined with an incorrect statement, it's still wrong. However, the problem says \"the following statements are correct,\" so maybe only part of option (c) is correct, but the way it's written, both parts are in one option. Given that, and the second part being incorrect, option (c) is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the user might have made a typo in option (c), and the second part is about adding phenol to a solution of phenoxide, which would decrease the ionization of the phenoxide, but the statement says it decreases the degree of ionization of water. If the statement was about the degree of ionization of phenol instead of water, that would make sense. Maybe it's a typo. If that's the case, then adding phenol to the solution would decrease the degree of ionization of the phenoxide (base), which is correct. But the statement says water, which is incorrect. Given the ambiguity, it's hard to say. In an exam setting, if I had to choose, and assuming that the second part of option (c) is a typo and refers to the degree of ionization of the base instead of water, then it would be correct. But as written, it's incorrect.\n\nGiven all this, I think none of the options are correct as presented, but if I have to choose based on possible interpretations, perhaps option (c)'s first part is correct, but the second part is not. However, since the options are combined, and the user might have intended only certain parts, it's challenging. Given the information, I'll proceed to write the answer based on the analysis.\n</think>"}
