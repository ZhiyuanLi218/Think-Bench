There's this problem about six witches and ten sorcerers at a mixer. The witches shake hands with each of the sorcerers. The witches don't shake hands with each other because they're already friends, and the sorcerers don't shake hands with each other because they hate each other. The question is asking how many handshakes took place in total.\n\nAlright, so first, let me break this down. There are two groups: witches and sorcerers. The witches only shake hands with sorcerers, not among themselves. The sorcerers also only shake hands with witches, not among themselves either. So the only handshakes happening are between witches and sorcerers.\n\nSo, if there are six witches and ten sorcerers, and each witch shakes hands with each sorcerer, then for each witch, the number of handshakes they participate in is equal to the number of sorcerers, right? So each witch does ten handshakes. Since there are six witches, that would be 6 multiplied by 10. Let me write that down:\n\nNumber of handshakes = Number of witches × Number of sorcerers\nNumber of handshakes = 6 × 10 = 60\n\nWait, but hold on—is there a possibility of double-counting here? Like, if Witch A shakes hands with Sorcerer B, is that the same handshake as Sorcerer B shaking hands with Witch A? So if I just multiply the number of witches by the number of sorcerers, am I counting each handshake twice?\n\nBut no, actually, in this case, each handshake is between one witch and one sorcerer. So when we count each witch shaking hands with ten sorcerers, we are counting each handshake once from the witch's perspective. There's no double-counting because we aren't considering handshakes between two witches or two sorcerers, which aren't happening. Since the sorcerers aren't shaking hands with each other, and witches aren't shaking hands with each other, all the handshakes are unique cross-group handshakes. Therefore, multiplying 6 witches by 10 sorcerers gives the total unique handshakes.\n\nLet me verify this with another approach. Suppose we think about how many handshakes each sorcerer makes. Each sorcerer would shake hands with each witch. There are six witches, so each sorcerer does six handshakes. There are ten sorcerers, so total handshakes would be 10 × 6 = 60. Which is the same as before. So regardless of whether we calculate from the witches' side or the sorcerers' side, we get 60. Since both methods give the same result, that suggests that there is no double-counting here. Because each handshake is uniquely associated with one witch and one sorcerer, so whether you count per witch or per sorcerer, you're counting each handshake once.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to use combinations, normally the total number of possible handshakes at the mixer, ignoring any restrictions, would be C(total people, 2). But we have restrictions here. However, since only inter-group handshakes are happening, maybe we can calculate it as:\n\nTotal possible handshakes between witches and sorcerers = (Number of witches × Number of sorcerers) as above.\n\nBut another way: total people are 6 + 10 = 16. Total possible handshakes without any restrictions would be C(16, 2). Then subtract the handshakes that didn't happen: witch-witch handshakes and sorcerer-sorcerer handshakes.\n\nLet's try that method. Total possible handshakes: C(16, 2) = (16 × 15)/2 = 120. Then subtract the witch-witch handshakes and sorcerer-sorcerer handshakes that didn't happen.\n\nNumber of witch-witch handshakes that didn't happen: C(6, 2) = (6 × 5)/2 = 15.\n\nNumber of sorcerer-sorcerer handshakes that didn't happen: C(10, 2) = (10 × 9)/2 = 45.\n\nTherefore, total actual handshakes would be total possible minus those two:\n\n120 - 15 - 45 = 120 - 60 = 60.\n\nSo that also gives 60. So this method also confirms that the answer is 60. Therefore, regardless of the method, it seems like 60 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just check if there's any other possible angle. For example, maybe some of the handshakes between witches and sorcerers didn't happen? But the problem states that the witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. So that implies that every witch shakes hands with every sorcerer. So all possible inter-group handshakes happen. Therefore, the total is indeed 6 × 10 = 60.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 60. All the different methods converge to that, so I feel confident.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of handshakes is \\boxed{60}.\n</think>"}
