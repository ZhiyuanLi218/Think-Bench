Let me start by recalling what I know about weak acids and their dissociation. A weak acid, HA, will partially dissociate in water according to the equation:\n\nHA ⇌ H⁺ + A⁻\n\nThe pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant, Ka. So, if I can find Ka, I can calculate pKa as -log(Ka).\n\nThe problem gives me the number of moles of the acid, which is 0.0025 mol, and the volume of the solution, which is 0.250 L. First, I should calculate the initial concentration of the acid. Since it's a monoprotic acid, the concentration of HA is moles divided by volume.\n\nSo, concentration (C) = 0.0025 mol / 0.250 L = 0.010 M. Wait, 0.0025 divided by 0.25 is 0.01? Let me check that again. Yes, 0.0025 divided by 0.25 is indeed 0.010 M. So the initial concentration of the acid is 0.010 M.\n\nNext, the pH is given as 4.26. The pH is related to the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. Since the acid is weak, the H+ ions in solution come primarily from the dissociation of the acid. So, I can find [H+] from the pH.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-4.26). Let me calculate that. Hmm, 10^-4 is 1e-4, and 10^-4.26 is a bit less. Let me use a calculator for this. Wait, since I don't have a calculator, maybe I can approximate? Alternatively, maybe I can use exact expressions.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that pH = 4.26, so [H+] = 10^(-4.26). Let me convert 4.26 into 4 + 0.26. 10^-4 is 1e-4, and 10^-0.26 is... Hmm. Let me remember that log(0.56) is approximately -0.25, because log(0.56) ≈ -0.25. So 10^-0.25 ≈ 0.56. Therefore, 10^-0.26 is slightly less than 0.56, maybe approximately 0.55? Let me check with more precision. Alternatively, maybe I can use exact expressions for the calculation.\n\nBut perhaps I don't need the exact [H+] yet. Let me think about the dissociation equation again.\n\nFor a weak acid HA, the dissociation is:\n\nHA ⇌ H⁺ + A⁻\n\nLet me denote the initial concentration of HA as C = 0.010 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of H+ is x, which is equal to [H+] = 10^(-4.26). Wait, but since HA is a weak acid, the H+ comes from its dissociation, so x is equal to [H+] = [A⁻], assuming that the autoionization of water is negligible. However, in reality, the H+ could also come from water, but since the pH is 4.26, which is quite acidic, the contribution from water can be neglected. So, [H+] ≈ [A⁻] = x.\n\nBut also, the concentration of HA at equilibrium is C - x. However, since the acid is weak, x is probably much smaller than C. Let me check if that assumption holds. If the initial concentration is 0.010 M and [H+] is 10^-4.26 ≈ 5.5e-5 M (since 10^-4.26 ≈ 5.5e-5), then x is 5.5e-5, which is indeed much smaller than 0.010 M. So, C - x ≈ C. Therefore, the approximation that [HA] ≈ C is valid here.\n\nTherefore, the expression for Ka is:\n\nKa = [H+][A⁻] / [HA] ≈ (x^2) / C\n\nSince [H+] = x ≈ 5.5e-5, then:\n\nKa ≈ (5.5e-5)^2 / 0.010\n\nLet me compute that. First, square 5.5e-5:\n\n(5.5e-5)^2 = 30.25e-10 = 3.025e-9\n\nThen divide by 0.010:\n\n3.025e-9 / 0.010 = 3.025e-7\n\nTherefore, Ka ≈ 3.025e-7. Then pKa is -log(3.025e-7). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, log(3.025e-7) = log(3.025) + log(1e-7) ≈ 0.481 - 7 = -6.519. Therefore, pKa ≈ 6.519, which rounds to approximately 6.52. So looking at the options, option D is 6.52. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me check if my assumption that x is negligible compared to C is valid. Because if x is 5.5e-5 and C is 0.010, then x is 0.55% of C, which is indeed negligible. So the approximation is valid. Therefore, the calculation is okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should do a more precise calculation without assuming x is negligible. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote x = [H+] = [A⁻] = 10^(-4.26). Let me compute x more accurately. Let me use the exact value.\n\npH = 4.26\n\n[H+] = 10^(-4.26) ≈ 5.495 × 10^(-5) M. Let me confirm:\n\n10^(-4) = 0.0001\n\n10^(-0.26) ≈ e^(-0.26 * ln(10)) ≈ e^(-0.26 * 2.3026) ≈ e^(-0.5987) ≈ 0.5488. Therefore, 10^(-4.26) ≈ 0.5488 × 10^(-4) ≈ 5.488 × 10^(-5). So x ≈ 5.488e-5 M.\n\nSo, if I don't make the approximation, then:\n\nKa = x² / (C - x)\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nKa = (5.488e-5)^2 / (0.010 - 5.488e-5)\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n(5.488e-5)^2 ≈ 3.012e-9\n\nDenominator:\n\n0.010 - 5.488e-5 ≈ 0.010 - 0.00005488 ≈ 0.00994512 ≈ 0.009945\n\nSo Ka ≈ 3.012e-9 / 0.009945 ≈ 3.028e-7\n\nWhich is almost the same as before. So even without the approximation, the value of Ka is approximately 3.03e-7, so pKa ≈ -log(3.03e-7) ≈ 6.517. So still around 6.52, which is option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D:6.52.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes, for weak acids, if the concentration is low and the acid is very weak, the approximation [HA] ≈ C might not hold. However, in this case, the concentration is 0.010 M and the [H+] is 5.5e-5, so the approximation is valid. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there is another approach. Since the pH is given, and for a weak acid, if the dissociation is small, the pH can be approximated by:\n\npH ≈ 1/2 (pKa - log C)\n\nBut I need to recall the exact formula. The standard formula for a weak acid is:\n\n[H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka * C)\n\nWhich leads to pH ≈ 1/2 (pKa - log C) ?\n\nWait, let me derive it.\n\nStarting from [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C). Then pH = -log([H+]) = -log( sqrt(Ka * C) ) = -1/2 log(Ka * C) = -1/2 [log Ka + log C] = 1/2 (-log Ka - log C) = 1/2 (pKa - log C). Wait, but pKa is -log Ka, so yes. So:\n\npH ≈ 1/2 (pKa - log C)\n\nBut in this case, we have pH and C, so we can solve for pKa.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2pH ≈ pKa - log C\n\nTherefore:\n\npKa ≈ 2pH + log C\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the derivation again.\n\nIf [H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka * C), then:\n\n[H+]^2 ≈ Ka * C\n\nKa ≈ [H+]^2 / C\n\nThen pKa ≈ -log( [H+]^2 / C ) = -log([H+]^2) + log C = -2 log[H+] + log C = 2 (-log[H+]) + log C = 2pH + log C.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. Let me verify:\n\nStarting with [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[H+]^2 = Ka * C\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / C\n\nThen pKa = -log(Ka) = -log([H+]^2 / C) = -log([H+]^2) + log C = -2 log[H+] + log C = 2*(-log[H+]) + log C = 2pH + log C.\n\nSo pKa ≈ 2pH + log C.\n\nSo in this case, pH = 4.26, C = 0.010 M. Let's compute log C.\n\nlog(0.010) = log(10^-2) = -2.\n\nTherefore, pKa ≈ 2*(4.26) + (-2) = 8.52 - 2 = 6.52.\n\nWhich gives exactly the same result as before. So pKa ≈ 6.52. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nThis method is more straightforward. Using the approximation [H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka * C) gives us pKa ≈ 2pH + log C. Since this formula is valid when the dissociation is small (i.e., when [H+] << C), which is the case here, this gives us the correct result. Therefore, the answer is D:6.52.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
