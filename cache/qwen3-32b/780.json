The system is a two-level system with transition frequency ω, initially in the ground state |0>, and subjected to an external field with Rabi frequency Ω. Measurements are made every τ time intervals, where τ is much smaller than 1/Ω. \n\nFirst, I remember something called the quantum Zeno effect, where frequent measurements can inhibit the evolution of a quantum system. If you measure a system very frequently, it stays in its initial state. The probability of remaining in the ground state after each measurement would be something like exp(-pN), and we need to find p.\n\nBut how do I calculate p? Let me think. For a two-level system under a Rabi oscillation, without any measurements, the probability of being in the ground state oscillates sinusoidally. The Rabi frequency Ω determines the rate of these oscillations. The probability P(t) of staying in the ground state is cos²(Ωt/2), right? Because the state evolves as |ψ(t)> = cos(Ωt/2)|0> - i sin(Ωt/2)|1>, assuming the driving field is on resonance (since they mentioned transition frequency ω, maybe assuming resonance?).\n\nBut when we make measurements at intervals τ, each measurement projects the state back to |0> if it's still there. However, since τ is very small (τ << 1/Ω), we can approximate the time evolution between measurements as small. So after each interval τ, the probability of remaining in the ground state is approximately 1 - (Ω²τ²)/4, because for small x, cos²(x) ≈ 1 - x². So cos²(Ωτ/2) ≈ 1 - (Ω²τ²)/4. \n\nWait, let me check that expansion. cos(x) ≈ 1 - x²/2 for small x, so cos²(x) ≈ (1 - x²/2)^2 ≈ 1 - x². Therefore, cos²(Ωτ/2) ≈ 1 - (Ω²τ²)/4. So the probability of staying in the ground state after one interval is P ≈ 1 - (Ω²τ²)/4. \n\nNow, if we make a measurement after each τ, and the system survives each measurement, then after N measurements, the total probability would be [1 - (Ω²τ²)/4]^N. However, for small pN (since N is large but τ is small, maybe?), we can approximate [1 - (Ω²τ²)/4]^N ≈ exp(-N*(Ω²τ²)/4). Because ln(1 - x) ≈ -x for small x, so the product becomes exp(-N*(Ω²τ²)/4). \n\nTherefore, comparing to exp(-pN), p would be (Ω²τ²)/4. Looking at the options, option B is (τ²Ω²)/4. So that would be the answer. \n\nBut let me check again. Suppose the survival probability after each measurement is P ≈ 1 - Γ, where Γ is the probability of transitioning. Then after N measurements, it's (1 - Γ)^N ≈ e^{-NΓ} for small Γ. So Γ here is (Ω²τ²)/4. Therefore, p = Γ = (Ω²τ²)/4. So answer is B. \n\nBut wait, let me think if there's another approach. Maybe using the Schrödinger equation. The time evolution between measurements is governed by the Hamiltonian. For a two-level system driven by an external field, the Hamiltonian is something like H = ħΩ/2 σ_x (assuming rotating frame and on resonance). Then the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ). For small t=τ, we can expand U(τ) ≈ 1 - iHτ/ħ - (H²τ²)/2ħ² + ... \n\nBut H = ħΩ/2 σ_x, so H² = (ħ²Ω²/4) σ_x² = ħ²Ω²/4 * I, since σ_x squared is identity matrix. Therefore, U(τ) ≈ 1 - i(Ω τ /2) σ_x - (Ω² τ² / 8) I. \n\nBut the state starts as |0>. Applying U(τ) gives approximately |ψ(τ)> ≈ [1 - (Ω² τ²)/8] |0> - i (Ω τ / 2) |1>. Because σ_x |0> = |1>, and the identity term just multiplies by a scalar. \n\nThe probability of being in |0> is the square of the amplitude, so approximately [1 - (Ω² τ²)/8]^2 + (cross terms?) Wait, no. The amplitude for |0> is [1 - (Ω² τ²)/8] and for |1> is -i(Ω τ /2). Therefore, the probability P is |amp_0|² + |amp_1|²? No, wait. The total probability should be 1, but since we are approximating the time evolution, maybe up to second order. However, since we are interested in the probability of |0>, it's |amp_0|² ≈ [1 - (Ω² τ²)/8]^2 ≈ 1 - (Ω² τ²)/4, neglecting higher order terms. Because [1 - a]^2 ≈ 1 - 2a for small a. So yes, same result as before. Therefore, the survival probability is approximately 1 - (Ω² τ²)/4. \n\nTherefore, after N measurements, the probability is [1 - (Ω² τ²)/4]^N ≈ exp(-N (Ω² τ²)/4), so p = (Ω² τ²)/4, which is option B. \n\nBut let me check if there's a different convention for Rabi frequency. Sometimes Rabi frequency is defined such that the probability is sin²(Ωt/2), so if the Rabi frequency is Ω, then the oscillation frequency is Ω. But in any case, the small time approximation would still lead to the same result. \n\nAlternatively, suppose the time evolution is such that the probability of transition is (Ωτ)^2 / 2? Wait, no. Let me recall, for a two-level system, the transition probability from |0> to |1> at time t is sin²(Ωt/2). For small t, Ωt << 1, so sin²(Ωt/2) ≈ (Ωt/2)^2. Therefore, the survival probability is 1 - sin²(Ωt/2) ≈ 1 - (Ω² t²)/4. Therefore, same as before. Therefore, Γ = (Ω² τ²)/4. \n\nTherefore, p is Γ, so p = (Ω² τ²)/4. Hence, answer is B. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA: (τΩ)/2 \n\nB: (τ² Ω²)/4 \n\nC: (τ² Ω²)/2 \n\nD: (τ Ω)/4 \n\nYes, so B is the correct one. Therefore, the answer is B. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there is a factor that I missed. For example, if the measurement is not just the survival probability but considering the projection. \n\nSuppose after each time τ, we measure. The state evolves to |ψ(τ)> ≈ |0> - i (Ω τ /2) |1> + ... Then, the probability to measure |0> is |<0|ψ(τ)>|² ≈ 1 - (Ω τ / 2)^2. Which is 1 - (Ω² τ²)/4. So same as before. Therefore, each measurement has survival probability 1 - (Ω² τ²)/4. Therefore, after N measurements, the probability is [1 - (Ω² τ²)/4]^N ≈ exp(-N (Ω² τ²)/4). Therefore, p is (Ω² τ²)/4. \n\nYes, so the answer is B. \n\nAnother way: if τ is very small, then the Zeno regime is when the measurement is frequent enough to freeze the state. The decay rate is given by Γ ≈ (Ω² τ²)/4 per measurement? Wait, but usually the Zeno effect is often expressed in terms of the measurement rate. But here, since they are doing N measurements over a total time T = N τ. If N is large and τ is small, T could be fixed or varying. However, in this case, they are looking at the probability after N measurements, with each measurement separated by τ. The survival probability is exp(-pN). \n\nBut if we think of p as the effective decay rate per measurement multiplied by N. Since each measurement allows a small chance of decay, then total decay is pN. \n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of continuous measurement, the survival probability would be exp(-Γ T), where Γ is the decay rate and T is time. But here, it's discrete measurements. However, in this case, T = N τ. So if we write exp(-pN) = exp(- (p/τ) T). So if we compare to exp(-Γ T), then Γ = p / τ. But here, we have from before that the survival probability is [1 - (Ω² τ²)/4]^N ≈ exp(-N (Ω² τ²)/4) = exp(- (Ω² τ³ N)/4 * (N / N))... Wait, maybe not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, if we think of the total number of measurements N going to infinity with τ going to zero such that T = N τ is fixed. Then, the survival probability would approach exp(-Γ T), where Γ is the integral of the transition rate. But in that case, Γ would be ∫0^T (Ω²)/4 dt = (Ω² /4) T. Wait, but if we take the limit N→infty, τ→0 with T fixed, then N = T / τ. Then, exp(-pN) = exp(-p T / τ). For this to have a finite limit, pN = p T / τ must be finite. Which would require that p scales as τ. But in our case, p is (Ω² τ²)/4, so pN = (Ω² τ²)/4 * N = (Ω² τ²)/4 * T / τ = (Ω² τ T)/4 → 0 as τ→0. Which would mean the survival probability approaches 1, which is the quantum Zeno effect. \n\nBut in the problem, they don't take the limit N→infty and τ→0 with T fixed. They just have τ << 1/Ω and N >> 1. So τ is small but fixed? Or τ is small and N is large such that Nτ is...? Not specified. But the problem says that after N measurements, the probability varies as exp(-pN). So regardless of the total time, the expression is given as exp(-pN). Therefore, from our calculation, p is (Ω² τ²)/4. Hence, answer is B. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
