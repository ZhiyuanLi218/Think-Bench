The given parameters are the charge of the electron e, its mass m, the charge of the nucleus Ze, the initial velocity v₀ (which is much less than the speed of light c), and the impact parameter b. Then I have to calculate the rate of change of the square of the velocity, which is probably the derivative of v² with respect to time, or maybe something else? Hmm, maybe they want the time derivative of the velocity squared? Let me check. The question says \"calculate the rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$\". Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}$ is the acceleration, so $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ would be the square of the acceleration. But maybe they mean the derivative of the square of the velocity? Like $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\boldsymbol{v}^2)$? That would make more sense. Maybe there's a typo or notation confusion here. Let me see. If they want the rate of change of velocity squared, then that's the derivative of velocity squared with respect to time. Alternatively, if they mean the square of the rate of change of velocity, that's acceleration squared. I need to figure out which one they want. Let me proceed assuming that they want the derivative of the square of velocity with respect to time, because that might relate to energy considerations. But maybe the problem is about the power radiated or something else? Wait, no, the question says \"rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$\", so maybe they literally mean $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$, which is the square of the acceleration. Hmm. But in any case, I need to first find the equation of motion.\n\nSo, the electron is moving in the Coulomb field of the nucleus. Since the nucleus is heavy, we can assume it's stationary, and the electron is moving under the Coulomb force. The Coulomb force between the electron and the nucleus is given by $ F = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Ze \\cdot e}{r^2} $, but since the electron has charge -e and the nucleus has charge +Ze, the force is attractive. So the force on the electron is towards the nucleus. \n\nThe equation of motion would be Newton's second law: $ m \\frac{d^2 \\boldsymbol{r}}{dt^2} = \\boldsymbol{F} $. So I need to express the force in vector form. Let me set up coordinates. Let me assume that the nucleus is at the origin, and the electron is moving with initial velocity $ v_0 $ along, say, the x-axis. The impact parameter is b, which is the distance of closest approach if there were no force. So in the absence of the Coulomb force, the electron would pass by the nucleus at a distance b. \n\nBut with the Coulomb force, the electron's path will be deflected. The problem is to find the equation of motion. So maybe we can model this as a hyperbolic trajectory due to the Coulomb potential? But since the velocity is non-relativistic, maybe we can use classical mechanics.\n\nAlternatively, since the impact parameter is given, perhaps we can use the concept of scattering in a Coulomb field. But the problem says to determine the equation of motion. So maybe parametrize the position of the electron as a function of time, and find the differential equation?\n\nAlternatively, since the force is central, we can use polar coordinates. Let me think. The Coulomb force is central, so angular momentum is conserved. So maybe we can write the equations in polar coordinates.\n\nLet me recall that for a central force, the angular momentum is conserved. The angular momentum vector is $ \\boldsymbol{L} = \\boldsymbol{r} \\times \\boldsymbol{p} $, and since the force is central, $ \\boldsymbol{r} \\times \\boldsymbol{F} = 0 $, so $ \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{L}}{dt} = 0 $. Therefore, angular momentum is conserved. \n\nGiven that, we can use polar coordinates with the nucleus at the origin. Let me define r(t) as the distance from the electron to the nucleus, and θ(t) as the angle. The angular momentum is $ L = m r^2 \\dot{\\theta} $, which is constant.\n\nBut since the impact parameter is b, and the initial velocity is v₀, perhaps we can relate the angular momentum to the impact parameter. In the absence of the Coulomb force, the angular momentum would be $ L = m v_0 b $. Since angular momentum is conserved even with the Coulomb force, we can use this value. Therefore, $ m r^2 \\dot{\\theta} = m v_0 b $, so $ \\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{v_0 b}{r^2} $.\n\nNow, the equation of motion in polar coordinates for a central force. The radial component of the acceleration is $ \\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\theta}^2 $, and the angular component is $ r \\ddot{\\theta} + 2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta} $. Since the force is radial, the angular component of acceleration must be zero. Wait, but since angular momentum is conserved, we can derive that $ r^2 \\dot{\\theta} = constant $, which implies that $ \\frac{d}{dt}(r^2 \\dot{\\theta}) = 0 $, so $ r^2 \\ddot{\\theta} + 2 r \\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta} = 0 $, which gives $ r \\ddot{\\theta} + 2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta} = 0 $, hence the angular component of acceleration $ r \\ddot{\\theta} + 2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta} = 0 $. Therefore, the angular component of Newton's law is satisfied automatically because of the conservation of angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, the radial equation is:\n\n$ m (\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\theta}^2 ) = F(r) $\n\nWhere F(r) is the Coulomb force. Since the force is attractive, it's negative if we take r as a positive distance. Let me define the direction. Let me assume that the Coulomb force is towards the origin, so in the negative r direction. Therefore:\n\n$ m (\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\theta}^2 ) = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^2} $\n\nBut we can substitute $ \\dot{\\theta} $ from the angular momentum conservation. Since $ \\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{v_0 b}{r^2} $, then $ r \\dot{\\theta}^2 = r \\left( \\frac{v_0 b}{r^2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{v_0^2 b^2}{r^3} $.\n\nTherefore, the radial equation becomes:\n\n$ m \\ddot{r} - \\frac{m v_0^2 b^2}{r^3} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^2} $\n\nRearranged:\n\n$ m \\ddot{r} = \\frac{m v_0^2 b^2}{r^3} - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^2} $\n\nThis is a second-order differential equation for r(t). However, solving this equation might be complicated. But perhaps the question is not asking for solving the equation of motion, but just to write it down? Wait, the problem says \"Determine the equation of motion of the electron in the Coulomb field\". So maybe this is sufficient? But perhaps there's another way to write the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vector form. The equation of motion is Newton's second law with the Coulomb force. So:\n\n$ m \\frac{d^2 \\boldsymbol{r}}{dt^2} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $\n\nBecause the Coulomb force is $ \\boldsymbol{F} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^2} \\hat{r} $, and $ \\hat{r} = \\boldsymbol{r}/r $, so $ \\boldsymbol{F} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $.\n\nTherefore, the equation of motion is:\n\n$ m \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{r}} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $\n\nThat's a vector equation. Depending on what the question expects, maybe this is the equation of motion. But perhaps they want it in terms of components or something else. However, since the problem mentions the impact parameter b, maybe they want to express the equation in terms of coordinates where the impact parameter is considered. For example, in the coordinate system where the nucleus is at the origin, and the electron's trajectory is in the plane, with impact parameter b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize the motion in terms of coordinates. Let me consider that the electron approaches along the x-axis with impact parameter b. So initially, at t = -∞, the electron is at position (x, y) = (-∞, b), moving with velocity (v₀, 0). The Coulomb force will act towards the origin, causing a deflection. The trajectory is a hyperbola, but solving for the exact trajectory might be complex. However, perhaps the question just wants the equation of motion, which is the differential equation above.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"Determine the equation of motion of the electron in the Coulomb field\". So the answer is likely the vector equation $ m \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{r}} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $. However, maybe they want it expressed in terms of components or in another coordinate system. But since the problem gives an impact parameter b, maybe we need to express the equation in terms of coordinates relative to the impact parameter. For example, using coordinates where the electron's motion is in the plane, with the nucleus at the origin, and the impact parameter is b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates where the electron's position is given by (x(t), y(t)) with y(t) = b + something? Not sure. Maybe the problem wants the equation in terms of coordinates, but unless there's more information, the equation of motion is just Newton's law with the Coulomb force.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"the impact parameter is b\". The impact parameter is the perpendicular distance between the initial velocity vector and the center of the nucleus. So if we set up coordinates with the nucleus at the origin, the electron's initial trajectory is along the x-axis, and the electron is offset along the y-axis by b. So initial position at t = 0 is (x, y) = (-∞, b), but more realistically, at some initial time, the electron is at position (x, y) = (x₀, b), with velocity (v₀, 0), where x₀ is very large negative. \n\nBut regardless, the equation of motion is as above. Therefore, I think the equation of motion is the vector equation given by Newton's second law with the Coulomb force. Therefore, the answer to the first part is that equation. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: calculate the rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$. Wait, so $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}$ is the acceleration, so $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ is the square of the acceleration. Alternatively, if the notation is $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\boldsymbol{v}^2)$, that would be different. Let me check the notation. In physics, a dot over a vector typically denotes the time derivative. So $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}$ is acceleration, and $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ is the square of the acceleration. However, the problem says \"rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$\", which is a bit ambiguous. If it's the rate of change of velocity squared, that would be $ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\boldsymbol{v}^2) $, but if it's the square of the rate of change of velocity, that's $ (\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}})^2 $. Given that they wrote $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$, I think it's the latter. However, maybe it's a typo and they meant $ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\boldsymbol{v}^2) $. Let me think about both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider $ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\boldsymbol{v}^2) $. The square of velocity is $ v^2 = \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} $. Then, the derivative is $ 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}} $. Since $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}} = \\boldsymbol{a} $, this is $ 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} $. This is related to the power, since power is $ \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} $, and since $ \\boldsymbol{F} = m \\boldsymbol{a} $, then $ \\frac{d}{dt} (KE) = \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} = m \\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} $. Therefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\frac{1}{2} m v^2) = \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} $, so $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = \\frac{2}{m} \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} $. Therefore, if the question is asking for this, we can compute it.\n\nAlternatively, if they want $ (\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}})^2 = a^2 $, then that's the square of the acceleration. Depending on the context, both could be useful. However, given that the problem mentions the rate of change of velocity squared, which is a bit ambiguous, but given that velocity squared is a scalar, the rate of change would be a scalar derivative. However, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ is also a scalar. Maybe the problem is using notation where $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ is intended to mean $ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\boldsymbol{v}^2) $. But in standard notation, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}$ is the derivative of velocity, so $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ is the square of the derivative. However, given the ambiguity, perhaps I should compute both and see which one makes sense in the context.\n\nBut let me check the problem again. It says \"calculate the rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$\". If they had meant the derivative of velocity squared, they would have written $\\frac{d}{dt} (\\boldsymbol{v}^2)$. But since they wrote $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$, which is the square of acceleration. However, the term \"rate of change of velocity\" is a bit confusing here. The rate of change of velocity is acceleration, so maybe they meant the rate of change of the square of velocity? Or the square of the rate of change of velocity? \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in notation. Maybe they meant the time derivative of the square of velocity, which is often denoted as $\\frac{d}{dt} (v^2)$. In some contexts, people might denote this as $\\dot{v}^2$, but that would be ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe in the problem statement, the notation is $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ meaning the derivative of the square of velocity. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that the problem is about scattering in a Coulomb field, and given that in such problems, the power radiated by the electron is related to the square of the acceleration (via the Larmor formula), which is $ P = \\frac{e^2 a^2}{6 \\pi \\epsilon_0 c^3} $, so if the question is about calculating the square of acceleration, that would make sense. However, since the problem says \"rate of change of velocity\", which is a bit odd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using notation where $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ is intended to mean the derivative of the square of velocity. In that case, as I mentioned before, it's $ 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} $. Given that, perhaps I need to check both possibilities. However, given that the problem is asking for the rate of change of velocity squared, which is a scalar, and since the equation of motion is known, we can compute both quantities. But since the problem is in the context of classical scattering, perhaps they want the square of the acceleration, which would be relevant for radiation. However, since the problem mentions that the velocity is non-relativistic (v₀ << c), maybe they want to use the Larmor formula? But the question doesn't mention radiation, so maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about energy. The rate of change of kinetic energy is $ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 ) = m \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} $. If they want the rate of change of velocity squared, then it's $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} $. So that's twice the rate of change of kinetic energy divided by m. But again, unless told otherwise, it's hard to know. However, given that the problem says \"rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$\", and given that $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}$ is acceleration, then $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ is acceleration squared. So maybe that's what they want. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using notation where $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ is the derivative of velocity squared. In that case, the answer is $ 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} $. However, given that the problem is in Chinese or another language and translated, maybe the notation is not standard. \n\nSince I need to make a decision here, perhaps I can calculate both and see which one is more relevant. Let me proceed with both. \n\nFirst, let's compute $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2 $, the square of the acceleration. From the equation of motion, we have $ \\boldsymbol{a} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $. Therefore, the square of acceleration is $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\right)^2 r^2 $, since $ \\boldsymbol{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} = r^2 $. Therefore:\n\n$ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^4} $.\n\nAlternatively, if they want $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) $, which is $ 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} $. Let's compute that. \n\nFrom Newton's law, $ \\boldsymbol{F} = m \\boldsymbol{a} $, so $ \\boldsymbol{a} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{F}}{m} $. Therefore, $ \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = \\frac{1}{m} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{F} $. The work done by the force is related to the power, which is $ \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} $. Therefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = 2 \\frac{ \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} }{m} $. \n\nBut since the force is conservative (Coulomb force), the work done should relate to the change in potential energy. The potential energy is $ U(r) = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r} $. Therefore, the kinetic energy plus potential energy is conserved. Therefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (KE) = - \\frac{d}{dt} (U) $. Therefore, $ m \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = - \\frac{dU}{dt} $. Therefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = 2 \\frac{ \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} }{m } = - \\frac{2}{m} \\frac{dU}{dt} $. But since energy is conserved, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (KE + U) = 0 $, so $ \\frac{d}{dt} (KE) = - \\frac{d}{dt} (U) $, which implies $ m \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = - \\frac{dU}{dt} $, so $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = 2 \\frac{ \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} }{m } = - \\frac{2}{m} \\frac{dU}{dt} $. But since energy is conserved, the total derivative of U is equal to negative the derivative of KE, so this is consistent. However, unless we need a specific expression, maybe we can compute $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) $.\n\nBut perhaps the problem wants $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2 $, which is $ a^2 $. Let me check dimensions. Acceleration squared has dimensions of [L]^2 [T]^{-4}. The rate of change of velocity squared (d/dt (v²)) has dimensions [L]^2 [T]^{-3}. So they are different. Given that, if the problem says \"rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$\", then since $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$ has different dimensions than rate of change of velocity squared, it's more likely that they meant $ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\boldsymbol{v}^2) $, but the notation is confusing. However, given that the problem is translated, maybe they meant something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the derivative of the square of velocity with respect to time, which is a scalar, and given that, perhaps they want an expression in terms of the impact parameter b. Let me think. If we can express $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) $, then maybe we can find it using energy conservation. Since the total mechanical energy is conserved, the kinetic energy plus potential energy is constant. Therefore, the derivative of kinetic energy is equal to negative the derivative of potential energy. Therefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (KE) = - \\frac{d}{dt} (U) $. Therefore, $ m \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2 / 2 ) = - \\frac{d}{dt} ( - \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r} ) $. Therefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2 ) = \\frac{2 Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{d}{dt} ( \\frac{1}{r} ) $. Therefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2 ) = \\frac{Z e^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{d}{dt} ( \\frac{1}{r} ) $. But unless we have an expression for r(t), this might not be helpful. However, if we can find dr/dt, then we can write this. Alternatively, if we use angular momentum conservation. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions the impact parameter b, maybe we can find an expression for $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) $ in terms of b and other given quantities. However, I need more information. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to compute the square of the acceleration, which is $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{d \\boldsymbol{v}}{dt} \\right)^2 $. Given the equation of motion, $ \\boldsymbol{a} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{m r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $, then $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^4} \\cdot r^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^2} $. Wait, because $ \\boldsymbol{a} $ is in the direction of $ -\\boldsymbol{r} $, so the magnitude is $ a = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{m r^2} $. Therefore, the square of acceleration is $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m r^2} \\right)^2 $. Wait, no, the force is $ F = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^2} $, so acceleration is $ a = F/m = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{m r^2} $. Therefore, the square of acceleration is $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m r^2} \\right)^2 $. \n\nBut how can we express this in terms of the impact parameter b? Maybe through the relation of r and b during the scattering. For example, in the case of Rutherford scattering, the distance of closest approach can be found, but here we are to find the rate of change... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe express r in terms of angular momentum and other variables. \n\nRecall that angular momentum L = m r² ω = m r² (dr/dt / r)? No, angular momentum is conserved, so L = m r² ω, where ω is the angular velocity. But we also have from energy conservation:\n\nThe total energy is E = (1/2) m v² - k / r, where k = Z e² / (4π ε₀). Since the initial velocity is v₀ and the impact parameter is b, the initial distance is very large, so the potential energy is negligible, so E ≈ (1/2) m v₀². Therefore, energy is conserved, so at any time:\n\n(1/2) m v² - k / r = (1/2) m v₀².\n\nBut angular momentum is also conserved: L = m v₀ b = m r² ω, where ω = dθ/dt.\n\nBut maybe we can express r in terms of the impact parameter and the angle? Or find an expression for r as a function of θ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find dr/dt from energy conservation. Let me try that. From energy conservation:\n\n(1/2) m v² - k / r = (1/2) m v₀².\n\nBut v² = v_r² + v_θ², where v_r = dr/dt and v_θ = r dθ/dt. Since angular momentum is conserved, L = m r² dθ/dt = m v₀ b. Therefore, dθ/dt = v₀ b / r². Therefore, v_θ = r dθ/dt = v₀ b / r. Therefore, v² = (dr/dt)^2 + (v₀ b / r)^2. \n\nSubstituting into energy conservation:\n\n(1/2) m [ (dr/dt)^2 + (v₀ b / r)^2 ] - k / r = (1/2) m v₀².\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n(1/2) m (dr/dt)^2 + (1/2) m (v₀² b² / r² ) - k / r = (1/2) m v₀².\n\nSubtract (1/2) m v₀² from both sides:\n\n(1/2) m (dr/dt)^2 + (1/2) m v₀² b² / r² - k / r - (1/2) m v₀² = 0.\n\nBut note that (1/2) m v₀² b² / r² - (1/2) m v₀² = (1/2) m v₀² (b² / r² - 1). Therefore:\n\n(1/2) m (dr/dt)^2 + (1/2) m v₀² (b² / r² - 1) - k / r = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/m:\n\n(dr/dt)^2 + v₀² (b² / r² - 1) - 2k / (m r) = 0.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(dr/dt)^2 = v₀² (1 - b² / r² ) + 2k / (m r).\n\nThis gives an expression for dr/dt in terms of r. However, solving for r(t) is still complicated, but perhaps we can use this to find expressions for acceleration or other quantities.\n\nBut the problem asks for the rate of change of velocity squared. If we consider $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) $, which from earlier is $ 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} $. But from energy conservation, since $ \\frac{d}{dt} (KE) = - \\frac{d}{dt} (U) $, we have $ m \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = - \\frac{dU}{dt} $. The potential energy is U = -k / r, so dU/dt = k / r² dr/dt. Therefore:\n\n$ m \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = -k / r² dr/dt $.\n\nTherefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = - 2k / (m r²) dr/dt $.\n\nBut from the expression above for dr/dt, we can substitute. However, this seems complex. Alternatively, maybe we can relate this to other terms. But this seems getting too involved. Perhaps there is a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the equation of motion, and we need to find $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2 $, which is $ a^2 $, then as I found earlier, $ a = \\frac{k}{m r^2} $, where k = Z e² / (4π ε₀). Therefore, $ a^2 = \\frac{k^2}{m^2 r^4} $. But how to express this in terms of b and v₀? Maybe using angular momentum conservation. \n\nFrom angular momentum conservation, L = m v₀ b = m r² ω = m r² (dθ/dt). But also, from the energy equation, we can relate r to other variables. However, without knowing r as a function of time, it's difficult to give a general expression for a². However, maybe the problem wants an expression in terms of r, which can be related to b through angular momentum. \n\nAlternatively, since the impact parameter b is related to the angular momentum, and if we can express r in terms of b and other variables, but I don't see an immediate way. \n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting me to find the maximum value of $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2 $, which would occur at the distance of closest approach. In that case, we can find the minimum distance r_min, and then evaluate a² at that point. \n\nTo find the distance of closest approach, we can set dr/dt = 0. From the energy equation:\n\nAt closest approach, dr/dt = 0, so:\n\n0 + v₀² (b² / r_min² - 1) + 2k / (m r_min ) = 0.\n\nWait, no, earlier we had:\n\n(dr/dt)^2 = v₀² (1 - b² / r² ) + 2k / (m r).\n\nSetting dr/dt = 0:\n\nv₀² (1 - b² / r² ) + 2k / (m r) = 0.\n\nRearranged:\n\nv₀² - v₀² b² / r² + 2k / (m r) = 0.\n\nMultiply through by r²:\n\nv₀² r² - v₀² b² + 2k r / m = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in r:\n\nv₀² r² + (2k / m) r - v₀² b² = 0.\n\nSolving for r:\n\nr = [ -2k/(m v₀² ) ± sqrt( (2k / m)^2 + 4 v₀^4 * v₀² b² ) ] / (2 v₀² )\n\nWait, let me write it properly. The quadratic is a r² + b r + c = 0, where a = v₀², b = 2k/m, c = -v₀² b². \n\nTherefore, solutions are:\n\nr = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in:\n\nr = [ -2k/m ± sqrt( (2k/m)^2 - 4 * v₀² * (-v₀² b²) ) ] / (2 v₀² )\n\nSimplify the discriminant:\n\n(4k² / m²) + 4 v₀^4 b².\n\nTherefore:\n\nr = [ -2k/m ± sqrt(4k²/m² + 4 v₀^4 b²) ] / (2 v₀² )\n\nFactor out 4 from the square root:\n\nsqrt(4 [k²/m² + v₀^4 b² ]) = 2 sqrt(k²/m² + v₀^4 b² )\n\nTherefore:\n\nr = [ -2k/m ± 2 sqrt(k²/m² + v₀^4 b² ) ] / (2 v₀² ) = [ -k/m ± sqrt(k²/m² + v₀^4 b² ) ] / v₀² \n\nWe take the positive root since r must be positive:\n\nr_min = [ -k/m + sqrt(k²/m² + v₀^4 b² ) ] / v₀² \n\nThis expression seems complex, but maybe we can simplify it. Let me write it as:\n\nLet me denote A = k/m, B = v₀² b. Then the expression becomes:\n\nr_min = [ -A + sqrt(A² + B^4) ] / B² \n\nWait, no. Wait, original expression:\n\nInside the square root, we have k²/m² + v₀^4 b². But if B = v₀² b, then B² = v₀^4 b². So sqrt(A² + B²). Therefore:\n\nr_min = [ -A + sqrt(A² + B²) ] / B² \n\nWait, no. Original expression:\n\nNumerator is -k/m + sqrt( k²/m² + v₀^4 b² ). Denominator is v₀². Let me write it as:\n\nr_min = [ sqrt( k²/m² + v₀^4 b² ) - k/m ] / v₀² \n\nThis is the distance of closest approach. However, this seems complicated. Maybe there is a better way to express it. Alternatively, if the electron is approaching with initial velocity v₀ and impact parameter b, then in the case of Coulomb scattering, the distance of closest approach can be found by setting the initial angular momentum and energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the distance of closest approach in Rutherford scattering. Wait, in Rutherford scattering, the distance of closest approach is when the kinetic energy is fully converted into potential energy, but that's only if the collision is head-on (b=0). For b ≠ 0, it's more complex. However, in our case, since we have angular momentum, the closest approach occurs when the radial velocity is zero, as we considered. \n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved for what the problem is asking. The problem says \"calculate the rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$\". If they want the square of acceleration, then at the distance of closest approach, the acceleration is maximum, since a ∝ 1/r², and r_min is the smallest r. Therefore, the maximum value of a² would be at r_min. However, the problem doesn't specify at what point, so maybe they want an expression in terms of r(t), or in terms of b and other given quantities. \n\nBut given that the problem gives the impact parameter b, and the initial velocity v₀, maybe they expect an expression in terms of those, possibly integrated over time or something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the force. The acceleration is given by $ \\boldsymbol{a} = \\frac{1}{m} \\boldsymbol{F} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{m r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $. Therefore, the square of the acceleration is $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^4} r^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^2} $. Wait, because $ \\boldsymbol{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} = r^2 $, so the square of the acceleration vector is $ |\\boldsymbol{a}|^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m r^3} \\right)^2 r^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^4} \\cdot r^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^2} $. \n\nSo $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^2} $. \n\nNow, if we can express r in terms of b and the angular momentum, maybe we can write this in terms of b. From angular momentum conservation, L = m v₀ b = m r² ω = m r² (dθ/dt). But how does this help us with r? \n\nAlternatively, if we consider the trajectory of the electron, in the Coulomb field, the equation of the trajectory can be found using the Binet equation or other methods. For a central force, the trajectory can be found by solving the differential equation for u = 1/r, where u is a function of θ. The Binet equation is:\n\n$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dθ^2} + u = - \\frac{m}{L^2} \\frac{d}{du} ( -k u ) $\n\nWait, for a central force F(r), the Binet equation is:\n\n$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dθ^2} + u = - \\frac{m}{L^2} F(1/u) $, where u = 1/r. \n\nGiven that F(r) = -k / r², so F(1/u) = -k u². Therefore:\n\n$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dθ^2} + u = - \\frac{m}{L^2} (-k u²) = \\frac{mk}{L^2} u² $.\n\nThis is a nonlinear differential equation, which for the Coulomb potential is known to have solutions corresponding to hyperbola, parabola, or ellipse depending on energy. However, solving this might be complex, but perhaps for our purposes, we can use the fact that in the Coulomb potential, the trajectory is a conic section. \n\nFor a hyperbolic trajectory (which is the case for repulsive or attractive forces with positive energy), the equation is:\n\n$ r(θ) = \\frac{L^2}{m k} \\frac{1}{1 + ε \\cosθ} $\n\nWait, but this is for the inverse-square law force. Let me recall. The general solution for the trajectory under a central force is complex, but for the Coulomb potential, the solution is a conic section. The equation for the trajectory in terms of u = 1/r is:\n\n$ u = \\frac{m k}{L^2} (1 + ε \\cosθ) $\n\nWhere ε is the eccentricity. For hyperbolic trajectories, ε > 1. \n\nBut let me check. For the gravitational case, the trajectory is $ r(θ) = \\frac{l^2 / (G M m^2)}{1 + e \\cosθ} $, where l is the angular momentum. In our case, the force is attractive, and the energy is positive (since the electron is moving with initial velocity v₀ and will escape to infinity), so it should be a hyperbola. \n\nGiven that, we can write:\n\n$ r(θ) = \\frac{L^2}{m k} \\frac{1}{1 + ε \\cosθ} $\n\nWhere ε is the eccentricity. The angular momentum L is m v₀ b, so L = m v₀ b. Therefore, substituting:\n\n$ r(θ) = \\frac{m² v₀² b²}{m k} \\frac{1}{1 + ε \\cosθ} = \\frac{m v₀² b²}{k} \\frac{1}{1 + ε \\cosθ} $\n\nNow, to find ε, we can use the energy. The total energy E is given by:\n\nE = (1/2) m v₀² (from earlier, since at infinity, potential energy is zero). \n\nFor a central force, the energy can also be expressed in terms of the eccentricity. For a hyperbola, the energy is positive, and the relation between ε, energy, and angular momentum is given by:\n\nε = sqrt(1 + (2 E L²)/(m k²))\n\nLet me verify this. For the gravitational case, the eccentricity is given by ε = sqrt(1 + (2 E L²)/(m k²)), where k = G M m. In our case, the potential is -k / r, where k = Z e² / (4π ε₀). Wait, actually, the potential energy is U = -k / r, so the force is F = -dU/dr = -k / r². Wait, but in the gravitational case, the force is attractive, so F = -G M m / r². Similarly, here, the force is attractive, so F = -k / r², with k = Z e² / (4π ε₀). \n\nThe energy for a central force is E = (1/2) m v² + U(r). For the trajectory, the energy can also be expressed as E = (k² / (2 L²)) (ε² - 1). Wait, I need to recall the exact relation. For a central force with potential U(r) = -k / r, the total energy is related to the eccentricity ε by:\n\nE = (k² / (2 L²)) (ε² - 1)\n\nBut let me derive it. For the trajectory r(θ) = (L² / (m k)) / (1 + ε cosθ), the energy is:\n\nE = (1/2) m v² - k / r\n\nBut v² = v_r² + v_θ² = (dr/dt)^2 + (r dθ/dt)^2.\n\nUsing dr/dt = dr/dθ * dθ/dt, and since dθ/dt = L / (m r²), we can express v² in terms of r(θ) and its derivatives. This is complex, but for the conic section, the energy is known to be E = (k² / (2 L²)) (ε² - 1). Let me check with the gravitational case. In gravity, for example, E = - G² M² m³ / (2 L²) for a bound orbit (ellipse), but here with the sign conventions, it might be different. \n\nAlternatively, using the vis-viva equation: for a central force with potential U(r) = -k / r, the vis-viva equation is:\n\nv² = k / r (2/r - 1/a)\n\nWhere a is the semi-major axis. But for hyperbola, a is negative. However, this might not help directly. \n\nAlternatively, since we know the energy E = (1/2) m v₀², and we can relate it to ε. Let's use the formula ε = sqrt(1 + (2 E L²)/(m k²)).\n\nSubstituting E = (1/2) m v₀², L = m v₀ b, k = Z e² / (4π ε₀):\n\nε = sqrt(1 + (2 * (1/2) m v₀² * (m² v₀² b²)) / (m (Z e² / (4π ε₀))² )) \n\nSimplify:\n\nε = sqrt(1 + (m³ v₀^4 b²) / (m (Z² e^4 / (16 π² ε₀² )) )) \n\n= sqrt(1 + (m² v₀^4 b² * 16 π² ε₀² ) / (Z² e^4 )) \n\nThis is getting very complicated, and I'm not sure if this is the right path. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should reconsider what the problem is asking for. \n\nThe problem says \"calculate the rate of change of velocity $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2$\". Given that I have the equation of motion, and assuming that they want the square of the acceleration, which is $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m r^2} \\right)^2 $, and since r can be expressed in terms of θ via the trajectory equation, but without knowing θ(t), this might not be helpful. However, if they want an expression in terms of the impact parameter b, perhaps using angular momentum conservation. \n\nFrom angular momentum, L = m v₀ b = m r² dθ/dt, so dθ/dt = v₀ b / r². But how does this help with r? \n\nAlternatively, using the expression for r in terms of θ, if we can find r as a function of θ, then we can express a² as a function of θ. But this seems too involved. \n\nGiven that I might be overcomplicating, let me return to the original question. The first part asks to determine the equation of motion, which I have as $ m \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{r}} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $. \n\nFor the second part, if the question is asking for the square of the acceleration, then it is $ \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m r^2} \\right)^2 $. If it's asking for the derivative of the square of velocity, it is $ 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} $, which from energy conservation is related to the derivative of potential energy. \n\nBut since the problem mentions the impact parameter b, perhaps they expect an expression in terms of b. Let me think about the derivative of velocity squared. \n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n$ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\left( - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{m r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} \\right) $\n\nSo:\n\n$ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = - \\frac{Z e^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{ \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} }{r^3} $\n\nNow, $ \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} = v r \\cosφ $, where φ is the angle between velocity and position vectors. This depends on the specific trajectory, so without knowing φ, we can't simplify further. However, using angular momentum conservation, we can express this in terms of b. \n\nFrom angular momentum: L = m v₀ b = m r² ω = m r² (dθ/dt). Also, the angle between r and v is such that the angular momentum is conserved. However, this might not directly help with $ \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} $. \n\nAlternatively, note that $ \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\boldsymbol{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r}) / 2 - \\boldsymbol{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} $? Wait, no. Let me recall that $ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\boldsymbol{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r}) = 2 \\boldsymbol{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} $, so $ \\boldsymbol{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d(r^2)}{dt} $. Therefore, substituting back:\n\n$ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = - \\frac{Z e^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{1}{2 r^3} \\frac{d(r^2)}{dt} $\n\n= - \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right)\n\nBut from energy conservation, we know that the derivative of kinetic energy is equal to the negative derivative of potential energy, which is consistent with this. \n\nBut this still doesn't give us an expression in terms of b. Unless we integrate this over time or something. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should conclude that the problem wants the square of the acceleration, which is $ a^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m r^2} \\right)^2 $, and since r can be expressed in terms of the impact parameter b through the angular momentum, but without more information, this is as far as I can go. Alternatively, if they want the average value or something else, but the problem doesn't specify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the motion is under a central force, and the acceleration is given by the Coulomb force, then the square of the acceleration is simply the square of the Coulomb acceleration, which is what I wrote above. Therefore, the answer is $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}}^2 = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 m r^2} \\right)^2 $.\n\nBut since r is a function of time, this is a function of time. If the problem wants it expressed in terms of the impact parameter b, then perhaps using the relation from angular momentum. From L = m v₀ b = m r² ω, and since in the plane of motion, we can relate r and θ, but without knowing θ(t), it's still a function of θ. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider the closest approach, where r = r_min, then we can substitute r_min in terms of b and other quantities. But this requires solving the quadratic equation for r_min, which is complex. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of further progress, I think I should present the equation of motion as the vector equation and for the rate of change of velocity squared, give both possibilities and explain the ambiguity, but since the problem mentions the impact parameter, perhaps they expect an expression in terms of b. However, without more information, I can't proceed further. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the time derivative of the square of the velocity, which is zero in a conservative field, but that's not true. No, in a conservative field, the total mechanical energy is conserved, but the kinetic energy changes as potential energy changes. So the derivative of v² is not zero. \n\nWait, let me recall that for a conservative force, the work done is path-independent, but the derivative of v² is related to the force. \n\nGiven all this, I think the most reasonable answers are:\n\n1. Equation of motion: $ m \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{r}} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $\n\n2. Rate of change of velocity squared: $ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = 2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a} = - \\frac{Z e^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{ \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} }{r^3} $\n\nBut since this still has $ \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} $, which depends on the trajectory, perhaps there's another way. Let me use the expression from energy conservation. \n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n$ \\frac{d}{dt} (v^2) = - \\frac{2k}{m} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) $, where k = Z e² / (4π ε₀). \n\nTherefore, if we can express dr/dt, which from the energy equation is:\n\n(dr/dt)^2 = v₀² (1 - b² / r² ) + 2k / (m r)\n\nBut this is still complex. However, if we integrate this expression over time, we might find something, but the problem asks for the rate of change, not the total change. \n\nGiven that, I think the best I can do is to state the equation of motion and for the rate of change of velocity squared, give the expression in terms of the dot product of velocity and acceleration, or in terms of the derivative of 1/r, as above. \n\nHowever, since the problem might expect a more concrete answer, perhaps using the fact that in the case of scattering, the acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity at the point of closest approach, making the dot product zero, but this is only at that specific point. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the time I've spent, I'll proceed to write down the equation of motion and for the second part, give both interpretations, but highlight the most plausible one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe equation of motion is given by $ m \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{r}} = - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z e^2}{r^3} \\boldsymbol{r} $. The rate of change of the square of the velocity is $ \\boxed{ - \\frac{Z e^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 m} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) } $.\n</think>"}
