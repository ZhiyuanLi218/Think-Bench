The question gives me some information: the radius of Mars is about half that of Earth, and its mass is about one-tenth that of Earth. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the closest one. Let me start by recalling what the gravitational field strength is. \n\nI remember that the gravitational field strength on the surface of a planet is essentially the acceleration due to gravity at its surface. The formula for that is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula is g = G*M/R², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is its radius. \n\nBut wait, since they are comparing Mars to Earth, maybe I can relate the gravitational field of Mars to that of Earth. I know the gravitational field on Earth's surface is about 9.8 m/s², which is approximately 10 N/kg. The question gives options in N/kg, so maybe I can find the ratio of the gravitational fields between Mars and Earth, then multiply that by Earth's 10 N/kg to get Mars' value.\n\nLet me denote Earth's mass as M_E and radius as R_E. Then Mars's mass is M_M = (1/10) M_E, and its radius is R_M = (1/2) R_E. \n\nThe gravitational field on Earth is g_E = G*M_E/R_E². Similarly, on Mars, it's g_M = G*M_M/R_M². \n\nSo if I take the ratio g_M / g_E, that would be (G*M_M/R_M²) / (G*M_E/R_E²) = (M_M / M_E) * (R_E² / R_M²). The G cancels out. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: M_M / M_E is 1/10, and R_M is 1/2 R_E, so R_E / R_M is 2, so squared it's 4. Therefore, the ratio is (1/10) * (2)² = (1/10) * 4 = 0.4. \n\nTherefore, g_M = 0.4 * g_E. Since g_E is approximately 10 N/kg, then g_M ≈ 0.4 * 10 = 4 N/kg. So the answer should be B: 4 N/kg. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the ratio correctly. Let me redo the calculation step by step. \n\nGiven M_M = 0.1 M_E, R_M = 0.5 R_E. \n\ng_M = G*(0.1 M_E) / (0.5 R_E)² = G*0.1 M_E / (0.25 R_E²) = (0.1 / 0.25) * (G*M_E/R_E²) = 0.4 * g_E. \n\nYes, that's correct. 0.1 divided by 0.25 is 0.4. So 0.4 times Earth's gravity (which is ~10 N/kg) is 4 N/kg. So the closest answer is B. \n\nBut wait, I remember that the actual gravity on Mars is about 3.71 m/s², which is approximately 3.7 N/kg. So 4 N/kg is indeed the closest option. So B is the right answer. \n\nBut let me think again if there's any mistake in the calculation. Maybe I made an error in the ratio? Let's see:\n\nThe formula is g = GM/R². For Mars, substituting the values:\n\ng_M = G*(M_E/10) / (R_E/2)² = (G*M_E/R_E²) * (1/10) / (1/4) ) = g_E * (1/10 * 4/1) = 0.4 g_E. \n\nYes, that's correct. So 0.4 times 9.8 is roughly 3.92 m/s², which is approximately 4 N/kg. So B is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, if I plug in real numbers, let me do that as a check. Let me take Earth's mass as 5.97 x 10^24 kg, radius 6.37 x 10^6 m. Then Mars's mass is 0.1 times that, so 5.97 x 10^23 kg, radius 3.185 x 10^6 m. \n\nCalculating g for Mars: G = 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². \n\ng_M = (6.674×10^-11) * (5.97×10^23) / (3.185×10^6)^2 \n\nFirst calculate numerator: 6.674×10^-11 * 5.97×10^23 ≈ 6.674 * 5.97 × 10^12 ≈ 39.8 × 10^12 ≈ 3.98 × 10^13 N·m²/kg \n\nDenominator: (3.185×10^6)^2 ≈ (3.185)^2 × 10^12 ≈ 10.14 × 10^12 m² \n\nSo g_M ≈ 3.98 × 10^13 / 10.14 × 10^12 ≈ 3.92 N/kg. \n\nSo approximately 3.92 N/kg, which rounds to 4 N/kg. So option B is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
