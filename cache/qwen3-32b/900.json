Let me start by recalling what I know about thermodynamics and gas laws. The cylinder is thermally insulated, so no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. The piston is frictionless and heat-conducting, which means that the temperatures on both sides will eventually equalize because heat can transfer through the piston. But since the whole system is insulated, the total internal energy should remain constant. \n\nInitially, the piston is in the center, so each side has 1 liter of air. Let me note down the initial conditions:\n\nLeft side:\n- Volume, V₁_initial = 1 L\n- Temperature, T₁_initial = 200 K\n- Pressure, P₁_initial = 2 atm\n\nRight side:\n- Volume, V₂_initial = 1 L\n- Temperature, T₂_initial = 300 K\n- Pressure, P₂_initial = 1 atm\n\nAfter the piston moves, the volumes will change, but the total volume remains 2 L since the cylinder is closed. Let me denote the final volumes as V₁_final and V₂_final, with V₁_final + V₂_final = 2 L. The final pressure will be the same on both sides, let's call it P_final. Also, since the piston is heat-conducting, the final temperatures on both sides will be equal, T_final.\n\nSince the piston is frictionless and the system is in equilibrium, the pressures on both sides must be equal at the end. Also, because the cylinder is insulated, the total internal energy of the system should remain the same as the initial internal energy. \n\nFor ideal gases, internal energy depends only on temperature. Since air is mostly diatomic (nitrogen and oxygen), I can approximate it as a diatomic ideal gas, where the internal energy U = (5/2)nRT for each side. Wait, actually, for diatomic gases, the molar specific heat at constant volume Cv is (5/2)R. So internal energy is nCvT. So yes, U = (5/2)nRT. Therefore, the total internal energy initially is the sum of the internal energies of both sides, and this should equal the total internal energy finally.\n\nSo maybe I can write equations based on conservation of internal energy and the ideal gas law.\n\nFirst, let me find the number of moles on each side initially. Using the ideal gas law PV = nRT.\n\nFor the left side initially:\n\nP₁_initial * V₁_initial = n₁_initial * R * T₁_initial\n\nSimilarly for the right side:\n\nP₂_initial * V₂_initial = n₂_initial * R * T₂_initial\n\nSince both sides have air, which is the same gas, the number of moles can be calculated.\n\nLet me compute n₁_initial and n₂_initial.\n\nBut maybe I need to keep things symbolic first. Let me denote n₁ and n₂ as the number of moles on the left and right initially.\n\nSo:\n\nn₁ = (P₁_initial * V₁_initial) / (R * T₁_initial)\n\nn₂ = (P₂_initial * V₂_initial) / (R * T₂_initial)\n\nSince R is the same for both, and the volumes and temperatures are given, I can compute these.\n\nBut maybe I can keep R in the equations for now. Since R will cancel out later?\n\nAlternatively, since the internal energy is (5/2)nRT, the total initial internal energy is (5/2)R(n₁T₁_initial + n₂T₂_initial). And the final internal energy is (5/2)R(n₁ + n₂)T_final. Since internal energy is conserved, these should be equal. Therefore:\n\n(5/2)R(n₁T₁_initial + n₂T₂_initial) = (5/2)R(n₁ + n₂)T_final\n\nCanceling (5/2)R from both sides:\n\nn₁T₁_initial + n₂T₂_initial = (n₁ + n₂)T_final\n\nTherefore:\n\nT_final = [n₁T₁_initial + n₂T₂_initial] / (n₁ + n₂)\n\nSo if I can compute n₁ and n₂, I can find T_final.\n\nLet me compute n₁ and n₂.\n\nFirst, let me convert volumes to SI units? Wait, since the pressure is in atm and volume in liters, but since R has different values depending on units. However, since I will take ratios, maybe the units will cancel out. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the same R for both calculations. Let me recall that R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). That might be convenient here since the given units are in L and atm.\n\nYes, let me use R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).\n\nSo for n₁:\n\nn₁ = (P₁_initial * V₁_initial) / (R * T₁_initial) = (2 atm * 1 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 200 K)\n\nSimilarly for n₂:\n\nn₂ = (1 atm * 1 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 300 K)\n\nLet me compute these values.\n\nFirst n₁:\n\nNumerator: 2 * 1 = 2 L·atm\n\nDenominator: 0.0821 * 200 ≈ 0.0821 * 200 ≈ 16.42 L·atm/mol\n\nTherefore n₁ ≈ 2 / 16.42 ≈ 0.1218 mol\n\nSimilarly n₂:\n\nNumerator: 1 * 1 = 1 L·atm\n\nDenominator: 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 24.63 L·atm/mol\n\nTherefore n₂ ≈ 1 / 24.63 ≈ 0.0406 mol\n\nSo total moles n_total = n₁ + n₂ ≈ 0.1218 + 0.0406 ≈ 0.1624 mol\n\nNow compute T_final:\n\nT_final = [n₁T₁_initial + n₂T₂_initial] / (n₁ + n₂)\n\nPlugging numbers:\n\nn₁T₁_initial = 0.1218 mol * 200 K ≈ 24.36 mol·K\n\nn₂T₂_initial = 0.0406 mol * 300 K ≈ 12.18 mol·K\n\nTotal numerator ≈ 24.36 + 12.18 ≈ 36.54 mol·K\n\nDivide by n_total ≈ 0.1624 mol:\n\nT_final ≈ 36.54 / 0.1624 ≈ Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, approximate 36.54 / 0.1624. Let me compute 36.54 / 0.1624.\n\nWell, 0.1624 * 200 = 32.48\n\nSo 36.54 - 32.48 = 4.06\n\nSo 200 + (4.06 / 0.1624). Let me compute 4.06 / 0.1624 ≈ 25. So total T_final ≈ 200 + 25 = 225 K?\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 0.1624 * 225 = ?\n\nWell 0.1624 * 200 = 32.48\n\n0.1624 * 25 = 4.06\n\nTotal 32.48 + 4.06 = 36.54, which matches. So T_final is 225 K. Nice, that's a clean number. So the final temperature is 225 K.\n\nOkay, so that gives me T_final = 225 K.\n\nNow, need to find the final pressure P_final. Since the total internal energy is conserved, but how do I relate that to pressure? Alternatively, since we know the final temperature and the total number of moles, maybe we can use the ideal gas law for each side?\n\nBut since the piston is allowed to move, the volumes will adjust such that the pressures are equal. Also, the total volume is fixed at 2 L.\n\nLet me think. For each side, the ideal gas law holds:\n\nFor the left side:\n\nP_final * V₁_final = n₁ * R * T_final\n\nFor the right side:\n\nP_final * V₂_final = n₂ * R * T_final\n\nAnd since V₁_final + V₂_final = 2 L.\n\nTherefore, adding the two equations:\n\nP_final * (V₁_final + V₂_final) = P_final * 2 L = R * T_final * (n₁ + n₂)\n\nTherefore:\n\nP_final = [R * T_final * (n₁ + n₂)] / 2 L\n\nWe already have n₁ + n₂ ≈ 0.1624 mol, T_final = 225 K, R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), so let's compute:\n\nP_final = [0.0821 * 225 * 0.1624] / 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is [R*T_final*(n₁ + n₂)] / 2 L.\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nP_final * 2 L = R * T_final * (n₁ + n₂)\n\nTherefore,\n\nP_final = [R * T_final * (n₁ + n₂)] / 2 L\n\nSo plugging numbers:\n\nR = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)\n\nT_final = 225 K\n\nn_total = 0.1624 mol\n\nTherefore,\n\nP_final = (0.0821 * 225 * 0.1624) / 2 ?\n\nWait, let me compute numerator first:\n\n0.0821 * 225 = Let me compute 0.0821 * 200 = 16.42, 0.0821 * 25 = 2.0525, total ≈ 16.42 + 2.0525 ≈ 18.4725\n\nThen multiply by 0.1624:\n\n18.4725 * 0.1624 ≈ Let me approximate this.\n\nFirst, 18 * 0.1624 ≈ 2.9232, and 0.4725 * 0.1624 ≈ approx 0.0767. So total ≈ 2.9232 + 0.0767 ≈ 3.0 L·atm ?\n\nWait, because 0.0821 * 225 * 0.1624 has units of (L·atm/(mol·K)) * K * mol = L·atm. Then divide by 2 L, gives atm.\n\nSo numerator ≈ 3.0 L·atm, divided by 2 L gives 1.5 atm. So P_final ≈ 1.5 atm?\n\nBut let me check with precise calculation:\n\nFirst compute 0.0821 * 225:\n\n0.0821 * 225:\n\nWell 225 * 0.08 = 18, 225 * 0.0021 = 0.4725, so total 18 + 0.4725 = 18.4725 L·atm/(mol) * mol? Wait, no. Wait R*T is 0.0821*(L·atm/(mol·K)) * 225 K = 0.0821*225 L·atm/mol.\n\nThen multiply by n_total (mol):\n\nSo 0.0821*225*0.1624 L·atm.\n\nSo 0.0821 * 225 = 18.4725 as above.\n\nThen 18.4725 * 0.1624:\n\nLet me compute 18.4725 * 0.1624:\n\nLet me write 18.4725 * 0.1624 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 18.4725 * 0.1 = 1.84725\n\n18.4725 * 0.06 = 1.10835\n\n18.4725 * 0.0024 ≈ 0.044334\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1.84725 + 1.10835 = 2.9556 + 0.044334 ≈ 3.0 L·atm. Exactly as before. So then divide by 2 L:\n\nP_final = 3.0 / 2 = 1.5 atm.\n\nSo P_final is 1.5 atm. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but let me check if there is another way to get this result. For example, if I use the initial pressures and temperatures, is there a way to get 1.5 atm?\n\nAlternatively, since the total internal energy is conserved, and we found T_final = 225 K, then using the ideal gas law for the entire system?\n\nBut the entire system isn't at a uniform pressure or temperature initially, so maybe not. But after equilibrium, the whole system can be considered as two separate volumes with same pressure and temperature. But since the total volume is fixed, and total number of moles is fixed, then if we consider the whole system, PV = nRT would be P_total * V_total = n_total R T_final. But here, P_total is P_final, V_total is 2 L. Which is exactly the equation we used. Therefore, P_final * 2 L = n_total R T_final. So that gives P_final = (n_total R T_final)/2 L. Which is the same as above. Therefore, 1.5 atm. So that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me verify with another approach. Let me think about the individual volumes.\n\nSince we have for each side:\n\nLeft side: P_final * V₁ = n₁ R T_final\n\nRight side: P_final * V₂ = n₂ R T_final\n\nTherefore, dividing these two equations:\n\nV₁ / V₂ = (n₁ / n₂) * (T_final / T_final) = n₁ / n₂\n\nTherefore, V₁ / V₂ = n₁ / n₂ ≈ 0.1218 / 0.0406 ≈ 3. So V₁ ≈ 3 V₂. Since V₁ + V₂ = 2 L, then V₁ = 3 V₂, so 3 V₂ + V₂ = 4 V₂ = 2 L => V₂ = 0.5 L, V₁ = 1.5 L.\n\nTherefore, the piston moves to 1.5 L on the left and 0.5 L on the right.\n\nLet me check with the numbers:\n\nFrom earlier, n₁ ≈ 0.1218 mol, n₂ ≈ 0.0406 mol. So ratio n₁/n₂ ≈ 3. Exactly. So V₁/V₂ = 3, so volumes are 1.5 L and 0.5 L. Then let's check if with these volumes and T_final = 225 K, the pressure is indeed 1.5 atm.\n\nFor the left side:\n\nP_final = n₁ R T_final / V₁ = (0.1218 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K))(225 K) / 1.5 L\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n0.1218 * 0.0821 ≈ Let me compute 0.12 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.009852, and 0.0018 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.0001478. Total ≈ 0.0100 L·atm/K. Multiply by 225 K:\n\n≈ 0.0100 * 225 ≈ 2.25 L·atm. Divide by 1.5 L: 2.25 / 1.5 = 1.5 atm. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for the right side:\n\nP_final = n₂ R T_final / V₂ = (0.0406 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K))(225 K) / 0.5 L\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n0.0406 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.00333 L·atm/K. Multiply by 225 K ≈ 0.00333 * 225 ≈ 0.749 L·atm. Divide by 0.5 L: 0.749 / 0.5 ≈ 1.498 atm ≈ 1.5 atm. Correct. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the final pressure is 1.5 atm and the final temperature is 225 K.\n\nBut let me think again: the problem says the cylinder is thermally insulated. Therefore, the process is adiabatic? But since the piston is heat-conducting, heat can flow between the two sides. So the total system is insulated, but heat can be transferred internally. Therefore, the first law for the total system is ΔU = 0, since Q = 0 and W = 0? Because the piston is part of the system, so work done by one side is work done on the other side. Therefore, total work is zero? Therefore, total internal energy is conserved. Which is what I used earlier. So that approach is valid.\n\nAlternatively, if we thought about each side undergoing some process, but since they can exchange heat and work, it's more complicated. But since we know that total internal energy is conserved and that the final pressure and temperature are same on both sides, using the internal energy approach is the way to go.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the final pressure is 1.5 atm and the final temperature is 225 K.\n\nBut let me check if there is another way someone might approach this problem, perhaps making a mistake. For example, someone might think that since the pressures are different initially, and the piston moves until pressures equalize, assuming temperature remains the same? But that would be wrong because the piston is heat-conducting, so temperatures will equilibrate. Also, since the system is insulated, temperature cannot remain the same unless there is some specific condition. So that approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, someone might try to use the formula for adiabatic processes, but since the two sides can exchange heat, it's not adiabatic for each side. Therefore, that approach is also invalid.\n\nTherefore, my solution seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the numbers again for T_final. Given that n₁ ≈ 0.1218 mol, n₂ ≈ 0.0406 mol.\n\nT_final = (n₁T₁ + n₂T₂)/(n₁ + n₂) = (0.1218*200 + 0.0406*300)/0.1624.\n\nCalculates to:\n\n0.1218*200 = 24.36\n\n0.0406*300 = 12.18\n\nTotal numerator: 24.36 + 12.18 = 36.54\n\nDivide by 0.1624: 36.54 / 0.1624.\n\nLet me compute 36.54 divided by 0.1624.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals: 365400 / 1624 ≈ Let me divide 365400 by 1624.\n\nFirst, approximate 1624 * 225 = ?\n\nWell, 1624 * 200 = 324800\n\n1624 * 25 = 40,600\n\nTotal 324800 + 40,600 = 365,400. Exactly! Therefore, 1624 * 225 = 365,400. Therefore, 365,400 / 1624 = 225. Therefore, T_final is exactly 225 K. Perfect, so my approximate calculation was precise. Therefore, T_final = 225 K exactly.\n\nSimilarly, P_final calculation gave exactly 1.5 atm. Let me check again with exact numbers.\n\nSince T_final = 225 K, n_total = n₁ + n₂ = (2/(0.0821*200)) + (1/(0.0821*300)).\n\nBut let me compute n_total:\n\nn_total = [2/(0.0821*200) + 1/(0.0821*300)] = [2/(16.42) + 1/(24.63)] ≈ [0.1218 + 0.0406] ≈ 0.1624 mol as before.\n\nBut let me do it more symbolically. Let me write:\n\nn_total = (P₁V₁)/(RT₁) + (P₂V₂)/(RT₂) = [P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂]/R\n\nTherefore, T_final = [ (P₁V₁/T₁) * T₁ + (P₂V₂/T₂) * T₂ ] / [ (P₁V₁/T₁) + (P₂V₂/T₂) ) ] ?\n\nWait, no. Wait earlier we had T_final = [n₁T₁ + n₂T₂]/(n₁ + n₂). But n₁ = (P₁V₁)/(RT₁), so n₁T₁ = P₁V₁/R. Similarly n₂T₂ = P₂V₂/R. Therefore, T_final = [P₁V₁/R + P₂V₂/R]/[ (P₁V₁)/(RT₁) + (P₂V₂)/(RT₂) ) ] = [ (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)/R ] / [ (P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂)/R ] = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂) / (P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ )\n\nAh! Therefore, T_final can be calculated without computing n₁ and n₂ explicitly.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nP₁V₁ + P₂V₂ = (2 atm * 1 L) + (1 atm * 1 L) = 2 + 1 = 3 L·atm\n\nP₁V₁ / T₁ + P₂V₂ / T₂ = (2*1)/200 + (1*1)/300 = 2/200 + 1/300 = 1/100 + 1/300 = (3 + 1)/300 = 4/300 = 1/75 L·atm/K\n\nTherefore, T_final = 3 / (1/75) = 225 K. Exactly. So that's another way to calculate T_final without going through moles. That's elegant. Therefore, T_final is indeed 225 K.\n\nSimilarly, for P_final, since P_final * V_total = (n₁ + n₂) R T_final. But (n₁ + n₂) R = [P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂] from above. Which was 1/75 L·atm/K * R? Wait no:\n\nWait (n₁ + n₂) R = [P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂]. Because n₁R = P₁V₁ / T₁, and n₂R = P₂V₂ / T₂. Therefore, (n₁ + n₂) R T_final = [P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂] * T_final. Therefore, P_final * V_total = [P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂] * T_final. Therefore:\n\nP_final = [ (P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ ) * T_final ] / V_total\n\nBut we already know T_final = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂) / (P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ )\n\nTherefore substituting:\n\nP_final = [ (P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ ) * (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂) / (P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ ) ) ] / V_total = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)/V_total\n\nTherefore P_final = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)/V_total\n\nWait, really? That seems surprising. Let me check with numbers:\n\nP₁V₁ + P₂V₂ = 2*1 + 1*1 = 3 L·atm. V_total = 2 L. Therefore P_final = 3 / 2 = 1.5 atm. Exactly as before. So this is a much simpler formula!\n\nWow, so in general, when you have two ideal gases separated by a movable, diathermal piston in an insulated cylinder, the final pressure is simply (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)/V_total. And the final temperature can be found by that other formula. That's a useful result.\n\nSo that's another way to think about it. Since the total internal energy is conserved, but also, because the final pressure can be found directly from the sum of initial PVs divided by total volume. That seems to be the case here.\n\nBut why is that? Because when you have P_final * V_total = P₁V₁ + P₂V₂?\n\nIs this a general result? Let me think. If you have two ideal gases allowed to exchange volume but with fixed total volume, and allowed to exchange heat so they reach thermal equilibrium, then P_final * V_total = P₁V₁ + P₂V₂?\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, in this case, since the total internal energy is conserved and for ideal gases, but here we derived that P_final = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)/V_total. Is there a way to see this without going through the internal energy?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total number of moles is constant. Wait, PV = nRT. For each side:\n\nInitially, n₁ = P₁V₁/(RT₁), n₂ = P₂V₂/(RT₂). Total n = n₁ + n₂.\n\nFinally, n₁ = P_final V₁_final/(R T_final), n₂ = P_final V₂_final/(R T_final). Total n = P_final (V₁_final + V₂_final)/(R T_final) = P_final V_total/(R T_final). Therefore, since total n is same:\n\nP₁V₁/(RT₁) + P₂V₂/(RT₂) = P_final V_total/(R T_final)\n\nMultiply both sides by R:\n\nP₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ = P_final V_total / T_final\n\nBut earlier we found T_final = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂) / (P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ )\n\nTherefore, substituting T_final into above equation:\n\nP₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ = P_final V_total / [ (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂) / (P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ ) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nP₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ = P_final V_total * [ P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ ) / (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂) ]\n\nCanceling P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ from both sides:\n\n1 = P_final V_total / (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)\n\nTherefore:\n\nP_final = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)/V_total\n\nWhich is the formula we had earlier. Therefore, this is general for such a problem where two ideal gases are allowed to exchange volume and heat, in an insulated cylinder (so internal energy constant). Therefore, this gives P_final = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)/V_total and T_final = (P₁V₁ + P₂V₂)/(P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ )\n\nTherefore, in this problem, since we have numbers:\n\nP₁V₁ = 2*1 = 2, P₂V₂ = 1*1 = 1. Sum is 3. Divided by V_total = 2, gives P_final = 1.5 atm.\n\nFor T_final:\n\nNumerator is P₁V₁ + P₂V₂ = 3\n\nDenominator is P₁V₁/T₁ + P₂V₂/T₂ = 2/200 + 1/300 = 1/100 + 1/300 = 4/300 = 1/75\n\nTherefore T_final = 3 / (1/75) = 225 K. Exactly. Therefore, this method is much more straightforward and avoids calculating moles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is final pressure 1.5 atm and final temperature 225 K.\n\nLet me check once more for any possible miscalculations or wrong assumptions.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. Ideal gas behavior. The problem says \"air\", which is a real gas, but under these conditions (probably not extremely high pressure or low temperature), ideal gas approximation is reasonable. Given that initial pressures are 1 atm and 2 atm, which are not too high, so okay.\n\n2. The piston is frictionless and moves until pressures equalize. Yes.\n\n3. The cylinder is insulated, so no heat exchange with environment. Yes.\n\n4. The piston is heat-conducting, so the two sides reach thermal equilibrium. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the approach is valid.\n\nAnother sanity check: initially, the left side has higher pressure, so the piston will move to the right, increasing the volume of the left side (which was under higher pressure) and decreasing the volume of the right side. Since the left side was colder initially, and the right side was hotter. After moving, the left side has 1.5 L and the right side 0.5 L. Let's see what happens to their temperatures.\n\nBut they both end up at 225 K. The left side was initially colder but had higher pressure. When it expands, its pressure decreases and temperature... Well, since heat is allowed to flow, the temperature ends up at the equilibrium value. Similarly for the right side, which is compressed, so its pressure increases and temperature... but again, heat flows to reach equilibrium.\n\nBut since we already checked the numbers with the ideal gas law and they give consistent pressures, and the internal energy approach gives consistent temperature, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the final pressure is 1.5 atm and the final temperature is 225 K.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final pressure is \\boxed{1.5} atm and the final temperature is \\boxed{225} K.\n</think>"}
