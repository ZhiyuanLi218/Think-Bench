I need to find the molar mass of a monoprotic weak acid. The problem says that 26.3 mL of 0.122 M KOH is required to neutralize 0.682 grams of the acid. The answer choices are given, so I should probably work through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with acid-base titrations, the key is to use the concept of equivalents. Since it's a monoprotic acid, that means each molecule of the acid donates one proton (H+), and each molecule of KOH donates one hydroxide ion (OH-). So the reaction should be a 1:1 molar ratio between the acid (let's call it HA) and KOH. The reaction would be HA + KOH → KA + H2O. Therefore, moles of HA = moles of KOH at neutralization.\n\nSo, first step: calculate the moles of KOH used. The formula for moles is molarity multiplied by volume in liters. The volume given is 26.3 mL, which is 0.0263 liters. The molarity of KOH is 0.122 M. So moles of KOH = 0.122 mol/L * 0.0263 L. Let me calculate that.\n\n0.122 * 0.0263. Let me do this multiplication. Let me convert 0.122 * 0.0263. Let me approximate. 0.12 * 0.026 is 0.00312, but since there are more decimals, maybe I need to be precise. Alternatively, I can use a calculator step-by-step.\n\nFirst, multiply 0.122 * 0.0263. Let me compute that:\n\n0.122 * 0.0263 = ?\n\nWell, 0.1 * 0.0263 = 0.00263\n\n0.02 * 0.0263 = 0.000526\n\n0.002 * 0.0263 = 0.0000526\n\nAdding them together: 0.00263 + 0.000526 = 0.003156 + 0.0000526 ≈ 0.0032086 moles.\n\nSo approximately 0.00321 moles of KOH. Since the acid is monoprotic, moles of acid = moles of KOH = 0.00321 mol.\n\nNow, the mass of the acid is 0.682 grams. To find the molar mass, we use the formula:\n\nMolar mass (M) = mass (g) / moles (mol)\n\nSo M = 0.682 g / 0.00321 mol ≈ let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, divide 0.682 by 0.00321. Let me do this division.\n\nWell, 0.682 / 0.00321. Let me convert the denominator to a decimal. 0.00321 is 3.21 x 10^-3.\n\nSo 0.682 divided by 0.00321 is equal to 0.682 / 0.00321 ≈ let me approximate.\n\nAlternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 682 / 3.21 ≈ ?\n\nCalculating 682 ÷ 3.21.\n\nWell, 3.21 * 200 = 642. So 682 - 642 = 40. So that's 200 + (40 / 3.21). 40 / 3.21 ≈ 12.46. So total ≈ 212.46 g/mol.\n\nSo approximately 212 g/mol. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 212 g/mol. So that must be the answer.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, moles of KOH: 0.122 M * 0.0263 L. Let me compute this more accurately.\n\n0.122 * 0.0263:\n\nFirst, 0.1 * 0.0263 = 0.00263\n\n0.02 * 0.0263 = 0.000526\n\n0.002 * 0.0263 = 0.0000526\n\nAdding them: 0.00263 + 0.000526 = 0.003156 + 0.0000526 = 0.0032086 mol. So that's 0.0032086 mol. Let me use more decimal places for accuracy.\n\nNow, the mass is 0.682 grams. So molar mass is 0.682 / 0.0032086 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 0.682 ÷ 0.0032086.\n\nLet me write it as 0.682 / 0.0032086 ≈ ?\n\nLet me convert both numbers to scientific notation:\n\n0.682 = 6.82 x 10^-1\n\n0.0032086 = 3.2086 x 10^-3\n\nDividing them: (6.82 / 3.2086) x 10^(-1 - (-3)) = (6.82 / 3.2086) x 10^2.\n\nCompute 6.82 / 3.2086 ≈ 2.125. Let me do that division more precisely.\n\n3.2086 * 2 = 6.4172\n\nSubtract that from 6.82: 6.82 - 6.4172 = 0.4028\n\nNow, 3.2086 * 0.125 = 0.401075\n\nSo total is 2 + 0.125 = 2.125, with a remainder of 0.4028 - 0.401075 ≈ 0.001725. So approximately 2.125 + 0.001725 / 3.2086 ≈ 2.125 + 0.000538 ≈ 2.1255.\n\nTherefore, the molar mass is approximately 2.1255 x 10^2 = 212.55 g/mol. Which rounds to 212 g/mol. So answer A is correct.\n\nLet me check the answer choices again:\n\nA: 212 g/mol\n\nB: 4.70 g/mol – that seems way too low for a molar mass. Probably not.\n\nC: 147 g/mol – lower than our calculation.\n\nD: 682 g/mol – that's 10 times the mass given, which is 0.682 grams. So probably not.\n\nSo A is the correct answer. Therefore, the molar mass is 212 g/mol.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
