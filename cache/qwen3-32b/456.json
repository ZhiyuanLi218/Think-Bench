Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about solubility and thermodynamics.\n\nFirst, I remember that solubility can depend on temperature. For many substances, solubility increases with temperature because the dissolution process is endothermic. But there are exceptions where solubility decreases with temperature, which would mean the dissolution process is exothermic. \n\nThe question states that cerium(III) sulfate is less soluble in hot water. So if I think about Le Chatelier's principle, if dissolving the salt is an exothermic process (releasing heat), then increasing the temperature (adding heat) would shift the equilibrium to the left, favoring the solid form. That would result in lower solubility at higher temperatures. Conversely, if dissolution is endothermic (absorbs heat), increasing temperature would shift the equilibrium to the right, increasing solubility.\n\nSo the key here is the enthalpy change of the solution process. If the solubility decreases when temperature increases, the dissolution must be exothermic. Therefore, the heat of solution (the enthalpy change when the solute dissolves) would be exothermic. \n\nLooking at the options, option A says the heat of solution is exothermic, which aligns with this reasoning. Option C says it's endothermic, which would contradict the observed solubility behavior. \n\nNow, what about the other options? Option B mentions hydration energies being very low. Hydration energy is the energy released when ions are surrounded by water molecules. If hydration energies are low, maybe the overall process isn't favorable? But how does that relate to temperature dependence? I'm not sure. If hydration is exothermic but maybe the lattice energy is higher? Wait, the overall heat of solution is the sum of lattice energy (endothermic, breaking the ionic bonds) and hydration energy (exothermic, forming bonds with water). If the dissolution is exothermic overall, that would mean that the hydration energy is more negative (more exothermic) than the lattice energy is endothermic. But I don't know if the hydration energies being \"very low\" would directly explain the temperature dependence. Maybe not directly. So B might not be the right answer.\n\nOption D says the solution is not an ideal solution. Ideal solutions follow Raoult's law, but I'm not sure how that relates to the temperature dependence of solubility. Non-ideal solutions can have various behaviors, but the question is specifically about the effect of temperature. So unless there's some non-ideality causing the solubility to decrease with temperature, but I think the main factor here is the enthalpy of solution. So D might not be directly related.\n\nSo between A and C. Since the solubility decreases with temperature, dissolution is exothermic, so heat of solution is exothermic (A). Therefore, the answer should be A.\n</think>"}
