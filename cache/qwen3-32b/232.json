The question is about the basic assumptions of special relativity and gives four options. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one(s). The question states that the options are about what is true in different inertial frames. \n\nFirst, I should recall what the two postulates of special relativity are. From what I remember, Einstein's theory of special relativity is based on two main postulates. The first one is the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. The second postulate is about the constancy of the speed of light, which says that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer. \n\nSo looking at the options given:\n\nA) The speed of light in a vacuum is constant. This directly matches the second postulate. So A seems correct.\n\nB) The time interval is relative. Hmm. Time dilation is a consequence of special relativity, meaning that time intervals can be different in different inertial frames. But is this considered a basic assumption or a derived result? The postulates are the foundational assumptions, and time dilation comes from them. So B might not be a basic assumption but rather a result. So B might not be the correct answer here.\n\nC) The mass of an object is invariant. Wait, in special relativity, mass is not invariant. There's the concept of relativistic mass, which increases with velocity, but modern physics often refers to invariant mass (rest mass). However, the question is about the basic assumptions. The invariance of mass isn't one of the postulates. The postulates are about the laws of physics and the speed of light. So C might not be correct.\n\nD) The energy of an object is proportional to its mass. This is Einstein's famous equation E=mc², which is a result of special relativity, not a basic assumption. So D is a consequence, not a postulate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Let me check again. The question says \"basic assumption of special relativity includes: in different inertial frames\". The first postulate is that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, which is not directly listed here. The second postulate is the constancy of the speed of light, which is option A. So yes, A is correct. The other options are either consequences or not part of the basic assumptions. \n\nI think that's right. So the answer should be option A.\n</think>"}
