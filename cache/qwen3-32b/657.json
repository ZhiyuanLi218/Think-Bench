Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that for any positive integer $ k $, $ f_1(k) $ is the square of the sum of the digits of $ k $. Then, for $ n \\geq 2 $, $ f_n(k) = f_1(f_{n - 1}(k)) $. So essentially, each subsequent function is applying the previous function's result into $ f_1 $. Therefore, $ f_n(k) $ is like applying $ f_1 $ repeatedly $ n $ times on $ k $.\n\nSo, my task is to compute this function 1988 times starting from 11. That seems like a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or cycle that emerges after some iterations. Let me start by computing the first few terms manually to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with $ k = 11 $.\n\nFirst, compute $ f_1(11) $. The sum of the digits of 11 is 1 + 1 = 2. Then square it: $ 2^2 = 4 $. Therefore, $ f_1(11) = 4 $.\n\nNext, $ f_2(11) = f_1(f_1(11)) = f_1(4) $. The sum of digits of 4 is just 4. Squaring that gives $ 4^2 = 16 $. So, $ f_2(11) = 16 $.\n\nThen $ f_3(11) = f_1(16) $. Sum of digits of 16 is 1 + 6 = 7. Squared is $ 7^2 = 49 $. So, $ f_3(11) = 49 $.\n\nMoving on to $ f_4(11) = f_1(49) $. Sum of digits: 4 + 9 = 13. Squared: $ 13^2 = 169 $. Therefore, $ f_4(11) = 169 $.\n\nNext, $ f_5(11) = f_1(169) $. Sum of digits: 1 + 6 + 9 = 16. Squared: $ 16^2 = 256 $. So, $ f_5(11) = 256 $.\n\nThen $ f_6(11) = f_1(256) $. Sum of digits: 2 + 5 + 6 = 13. Squared: $ 13^2 = 169 $. Therefore, $ f_6(11) = 169 $.\n\nWait, that's interesting. $ f_6(11) = 169 $, which was the value of $ f_4(11) $. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor $ f_5(11) $, 1 + 6 + 9 = 16, squared is 256. Correct. Then $ f_6(11) $ is sum of digits of 256: 2 + 5 + 6 = 13, squared is 169. Yes, that's right. So, we have 169 again. So starting from $ f_4(11) = 169 $, then $ f_5(11) = 256 $, then $ f_6(11) = 169 $, and then $ f_7(11) = f_1(169) = 13^2 = 169 $? Wait, no. Wait, $ f_6(11) = 169 $, so $ f_7(11) = f_1(169) $. Which is sum of digits of 169: 1 + 6 + 9 = 16, squared is 256. Therefore, $ f_7(11) = 256 $. Then $ f_8(11) = f_1(256) = 13^2 = 169 $. So, there's a cycle here between 169 and 256. So starting from $ f_4(11) $, the sequence alternates between 169 and 256. Let me confirm:\n\n- $ f_4 = 169 $\n- $ f_5 = 256 $\n- $ f_6 = 169 $\n- $ f_7 = 256 $\n- $ f_8 = 169 $\n- $ f_9 = 256 $\n- ... and so on.\n\nYes, so from $ f_4 $ onward, it alternates between 169 and 256 each time. Therefore, if we can figure out whether the 1988th term is in the odd or even position after this cycle starts, we can determine the answer.\n\nBut first, let's note the cycle start. The cycle starts at $ n = 4 $, with $ f_4 = 169 $, then $ f_5 = 256 $, and so on. So, starting from n=4, the terms alternate between 169 and 256. Therefore, for even n ≥ 4, what is the value?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=4: 169 (odd index? Wait n=4 is even, but 169 is the first term of the cycle. Let me think.\n\nLet me list the terms again with their indices:\n\nn: result\n\n1: 4\n\n2: 16\n\n3: 49\n\n4: 169\n\n5: 256\n\n6: 169\n\n7: 256\n\n8: 169\n\n9: 256\n\n...\n\nSo starting at n=4, the cycle is 169, 256, 169, 256,...\n\nTherefore, for n ≥ 4:\n\nIf n is even (like 4, 6, 8,...), the result is 169?\n\nWait n=4 is even, result is 169.\n\nn=5 is odd, result is 256.\n\nn=6 even, 169.\n\nYes, so for n ≥ 4:\n\nIf n is even, f_n(11) = 169\n\nIf n is odd, f_n(11) = 256.\n\nWait let's check:\n\nn=4 (even): 169\n\nn=5 (odd): 256\n\nn=6 (even): 169\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, given that, we need to find f_{1988}(11). Since 1988 is even, and 1988 ≥ 4, then according to the pattern, f_{1988}(11) should be 169. Therefore, the answer is 169? Wait, let me check if this cycle is indeed consistent and there's no mistake in my reasoning.\n\nBut first, let me check if the cycle is really of length 2. Let me compute a few more terms.\n\nf_8(11) = 169 (as above)\n\nf_9(11) = f_1(169) = 16^2 = 256\n\nf_10(11) = f_1(256) = 13^2 = 169. Yep, so it's definitely alternating. Therefore, the cycle is of length 2 between 169 and 256.\n\nTherefore, starting from n=4, even n gives 169, odd n gives 256. Therefore, since 1988 is even, and 1988 ≥ 4, the answer is 169.\n\nBut let me make sure that there isn't some longer cycle or something that I haven't noticed. Let me check if starting from 169, applying f1 repeatedly continues to cycle between 169 and 256.\n\nCompute f1(169): sum digits 1 + 6 + 9 = 16, squared is 256.\n\nf1(256): sum digits 2 + 5 + 6 = 13, squared is 169.\n\nf1(169) again gives 256. So yes, it's a cycle of length 2. Therefore, once you reach 169 at n=4, the sequence alternates between 169 and 256. Therefore, for n ≥ 4, if n is even, it's 169; if odd, 256.\n\nTherefore, since 1988 is even, the answer is 169.\n\nBut let me check the exact indices again. Let me make a table:\n\nn | f_n(11)\n\n1 | 4\n\n2 | 16\n\n3 | 49\n\n4 | 169\n\n5 | 256\n\n6 | 169\n\n7 | 256\n\n8 | 169\n\n...\n\nSo for n=4: 169 (even index 4)\n\nn=5: 256 (odd index 5)\n\nn=6: 169 (even index 6)\n\nSo yes, the pattern is for n ≥ 4, if n is even, 169; if odd, 256. Therefore, since 1988 is even, answer is 169.\n\nBut let me check if 1988 is indeed greater than or equal to 4. Well, 1988 is way bigger than 4, so yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 169. However, let me check once more if there's a possibility that the cycle starts earlier or something else. Let me check n=2, 16. If I continued before:\n\nIf I had started with some other number, but here we started with 11, so the sequence is as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in earlier steps?\n\nLet me recheck:\n\nf1(11): sum digits 1+1=2, squared is 4. Correct.\n\nf2(11) = f1(4): sum digits 4, squared 16. Correct.\n\nf3(11)=f1(16): 1+6=7, squared 49. Correct.\n\nf4(11)=f1(49): 4+9=13, squared 169. Correct.\n\nf5(11)=f1(169): 1+6+9=16, squared 256. Correct.\n\nf6(11)=f1(256): 2+5+6=13, squared 169. Correct.\n\nYes, so that's correct. Therefore, the cycle is indeed between 169 and 256 starting at n=4. So with that, since 1988 is even, answer is 169.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 1988 is even. 1988 divided by 2 is 994, so yes, even. Therefore, conclusion is 169.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"for n ≥ 2, f_n(k) = f_1(f_{n - 1}(k))\". So the recursion is correct. Therefore, my calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different way to approach it? Let me think. For example, maybe using modulo or something else? Not sure. But since we already have a cycle, and we can confirm that from n=4 onward, it's cycling every 2 steps, then we can use that.\n\nBut let me check the exact position. Let me think about how many steps are there before the cycle. From n=1 to n=3, we have 4, 16, 49. Then starting at n=4, we enter the cycle. Therefore, the cycle starts at n=4. Therefore, for term number m ≥ 4, we can compute how many steps into the cycle we are.\n\nThe cycle has period 2. Let me think of the term number. Let me denote term numbers starting at n=4. Let me let m = n - 3. For n=4, m=1; n=5, m=2; etc. But maybe not necessary. Alternatively, since starting at n=4, even n gives 169. Let me check:\n\nn=4: even, 169\n\nn=5: odd, 256\n\nn=6: even, 169\n\nSo for n ≥ 4, if n is even, it's 169, else 256. Therefore, since 1988 is even and ≥4, answer is 169. Therefore, the answer is 169. So I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute a few more terms. Let me compute f_7(11) which should be 256. Sum digits of 169: 1+6+9=16, squared is 256. Correct. Then f_8(11) is sum digits of 256: 2+5+6=13, squared 169. Yep. So cycle confirmed. Therefore, my reasoning is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that $ f_{1988}(11) = 169 $.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there is any possible mistake here. For example, maybe when they say \"for n ≥ 2\", maybe there's some different definition? Wait, no. The problem says:\n\n\"For any positive integer k, let f_1(k) denote the square of the sum of the digits of k. For n ≥ 2, let f_n(k) = f_1(f_{n - 1}(k)).\"\n\nTherefore, f_n(k) is f_1 applied n times. So f_1(k) is first application, f_2(k) is f_1(f_1(k)), etc. So my calculations are correct. Therefore, with that, yes, 1988 is even, answer is 169. So I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 169. So in boxed form, \\boxed{169}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{169}\n</think>"}
