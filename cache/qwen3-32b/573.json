It's about the 1s to 2p transition in hydrogen under the influence of two electromagnetic fields and a dc electric field. The question is asking for the frequency w2 of the second field such that the absorption probabilities of both fields are maximum and equal. The options are given in terms of e a0 E0, so I need to find the correct coefficient.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. The 1s to 2p transition in hydrogen involves the absorption of a photon that matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p states. Normally, without any external fields, this transition is governed by the dipole selection rules. The first field is linearly polarized along z and propagating in x, while the second is circularly polarized propagating in z. The presence of a dc electric field along z adds another perturbation, which might cause a Stark shift in the energy levels.\n\nThe problem mentions applying a dc electric field E0 along z. This is the Stark effect. The Stark effect in hydrogen can lead to shifts in the energy levels due to the interaction of the electric field with the dipole moment of the atom. For the 1s and 2p states, since 2p has angular momentum, the Stark effect might be linear or quadratic depending on the states involved. Wait, for hydrogen, the Stark effect for n=1 to n=2 transitions... Let me think.\n\nThe 1s state is spherically symmetric (l=0), and the 2p state has l=1. The dc electric field would induce a dipole moment in the atom. The first-order Stark effect for hydrogen is usually zero because of the selection rules, but for hydrogen, due to accidental degeneracy, the first-order Stark effect is zero for n=1 and n=2? Wait, no. Wait, the first-order Stark effect is zero for non-degenerate states. But hydrogen has degenerate states with the same n. So, for example, the 2s and 2p states are degenerate in the absence of external fields. The application of an electric field would break that degeneracy and lead to first-order energy shifts. However, for the 1s state, which is non-degenerate, the first-order Stark effect should be zero. But here, the dc field is applied to the vapor sample, so the question is about the energy shifts of the 1s and 2p states?\n\nWait, but the transition is from 1s to 2p. If the dc electric field causes a shift in the energy levels of 1s and/or 2p, then the transition frequency required would be adjusted accordingly. However, since the 1s state is non-degenerate, its first-order Stark shift is zero. The 2p state is part of the n=2 manifold, which includes 2s, 2p, etc. The 2p state has l=1, so when an electric field is applied, the first-order Stark effect would split the 2p states. However, the 2p states have different m values (-1, 0, +1). The dc electric field is along z, so the perturbation is proportional to -e E0 z. The matrix elements for the Stark effect would be between states with the same n but different l and m. But since we're considering the 1s to 2p transition, perhaps the dc field affects the 2p state's energy?\n\nWait, the dc electric field will cause a shift in the 2p state. Let me recall the formula for the Stark shift. For a state |n l m>, the first-order energy shift due to an electric field E along z is given by ΔE = -e E ⟨z⟩. For the 1s state, ⟨z⟩ is zero because it's spherically symmetric. For the 2p states, ⟨z⟩ depends on the specific state. For example, the 2p state with m=0 has a wavefunction that is proportional to z, so ⟨z⟩ would not be zero. Whereas for m=±1, the wavefunctions involve x±iy, so ⟨z⟩ would be zero? Wait, no, ⟨z⟩ is the expectation value of the position operator z. For the 2p states with m=0, which have angular part proportional to cosθ, which is related to z/r. So the expectation value of z for the 2p, m=0 state would be non-zero?\n\nBut wait, in reality, the expectation value ⟨z⟩ for any bound state should be zero because the potential is symmetric. Wait, no. Wait, for a hydrogen atom in an electric field, the perturbation is -e E z. The first-order energy shift is ⟨ψ| -e E z |ψ⟩. For the 1s state, which is spherically symmetric, this is zero. For the 2p state, say the 2p_z state (which has m=0), the wavefunction is proportional to z/r times the radial part. So the expectation value ⟨z⟩ would be something. Wait, but if the wavefunction is symmetric in some way?\n\nWait, actually, the expectation value of z for a stationary state should be zero because the potential is symmetric and the state is stationary. Wait, but if you have a state that is not symmetric, like a 2p state, which is not spherically symmetric, but still, the expectation value of position might not be zero. Wait, but in reality, for a stationary state, the expectation value of position is zero? Hmm. Let me think. For example, in the ground state of hydrogen, ⟨r⟩ is non-zero, but ⟨z⟩ is zero? Because the wavefunction is symmetric in all directions. For the 2p_z state, which is proportional to z, the expectation value of z would be zero? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the wavefunction is proportional to z * R_2p(r), so when you integrate z * ψ* z ψ over all space, you get something like ∫ z^2 |R_2p(r)|^2 r^2 dr ∫ sinθ cosθ dθ dφ. Wait, the angular integral would be ∫ cosθ * sinθ dθ dφ. The integral over φ is 2π. The integral over θ is ∫ from 0 to π cosθ sinθ dθ. Let me compute that: substitute u = sinθ, du = cosθ dθ. Then the integral becomes ∫ u du from 0 to 0 (since sin0=0 and sinπ=0). Wait, that's zero. So ⟨z⟩ is zero for the 2p_z state? That's strange. But then how does the Stark effect work?\n\nAh! Because the first-order Stark effect is ⟨ψ| -e E z |ψ⟩. If ⟨z⟩ is zero, then the first-order shift is zero. But then the first-order Stark effect would be zero for all states? But that contradicts what I remember. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The wavefunction for 2p_z is proportional to z * R_2p(r). The expectation value ⟨z⟩ is ∫ ψ* z ψ d^3r. Since ψ is proportional to z * R_2p(r), then ψ* z ψ is proportional to z^2 |R_2p(r)|^2. The integral over all space would be ∫ z^2 |R_2p(r)|^2 r^2 dr sinθ dθ dφ. The angular part is ∫ z^2 sinθ dθ dφ. Since z = r cosθ, z^2 = r² cos²θ. So the angular integral becomes ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ dφ. The integral over φ is 2π. The integral over θ is ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ from 0 to π. Let me compute that. Let u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ. The integral becomes ∫ u² (-du) from u=1 to u=-1, which is ∫ u² du from -1 to 1 = [u³/3] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - (-1)/3) = 2/3. So the angular integral is 2π * 2/3 = 4π/3. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨z⟩ is proportional to ∫ r^4 |R_2p(r)|² dr * 4π/3. Wait, but that's ⟨z²⟩, not ⟨z⟩. Wait, no! Wait, I think I messed up. The expectation value ⟨z⟩ is ∫ ψ* z ψ d^3r. But if ψ is proportional to z * R_2p(r), then ψ* z ψ is proportional to z² |R_2p(r)|². So the integral is ∫ z² |R_2p(r)|² d^3r, which is ⟨z²⟩. But ⟨z⟩ is zero because the integrand is odd under z → -z? Wait, no, because the wavefunction is real? Wait, no. Wait, the wavefunction for 2p_z is real? Yes, because it's proportional to cosθ. So the wavefunction is symmetric under reflection in z? No, wait. If you invert z → -z, then cosθ → -cosθ. So the wavefunction changes sign. But the probability density |ψ|² is symmetric. However, the expectation value ⟨z⟩ is ∫ z |ψ|² d^3r. Since |ψ|² is symmetric in z, but z is antisymmetric. Therefore, the integral over all space would be zero. So ⟨z⟩ is zero for the 2p_z state. Therefore, the first-order Stark shift is zero. Therefore, the first-order Stark effect for hydrogen states is zero? But then how does the Stark effect work for hydrogen?\n\nAh, right! For hydrogen, because of the degeneracy of different l states with the same n, the first-order Stark effect is non-zero. Wait, but the first-order Stark effect is usually zero unless there is degeneracy. For non-degenerate states, the first-order Stark effect is zero. However, when you have degenerate states, you have to consider the perturbation within the degenerate subspace. So for hydrogen, the n=2 states (2s, 2p) are degenerate. When you apply an electric field, you have to diagonalize the perturbation in that subspace. The perturbation is -e E z. The matrix elements between 2s and 2p states would be non-zero. So the first-order energy shifts come from the mixing of these states. Therefore, the energy levels split linearly with the electric field. However, for the 1s state, which is non-degenerate, the first-order shift is zero. Therefore, the dc electric field causes a shift in the 2p state (or more accurately, in the n=2 manifold), leading to a shift in the transition energy between 1s and 2p.\n\nTherefore, the energy shift of the 2p state due to the dc electric field is important here. The question is about the absorption of the two em fields. The first field is polarized along z, propagating in x, so it's a linearly polarized field. The second is circularly polarized, propagating in z. The presence of the dc field might affect the transition probabilities (absorption probabilities) of these fields. The problem states that with the dc field applied, the absorption probabilities of both fields are maximum and equal. We need to find w2.\n\nSo, the absorption probability is maximum when the photon energy matches the transition energy. Therefore, the frequencies w1 and w2 must be such that they match the transition energy after the Stark shift. However, since both fields are causing absorption, their frequencies must be adjusted accordingly. The problem says that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal, so perhaps both fields are resonant with the same transition, but due to different polarizations and directions, their transition matrix elements (oscillator strengths) might differ. However, the presence of the dc field might cause different shifts depending on the polarization and direction of the fields?\n\nWait, no. The dc field is static, so it affects the energy levels regardless of the polarization of the incident light. Therefore, the transition energy between 1s and 2p would be shifted by the dc field. The two em fields (field 1 and field 2) must then have frequencies adjusted to match this shifted transition energy. However, the problem says that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal. So perhaps the transition matrix elements (which depend on the polarization and direction of the fields) are different, but with the dc field applied, they become equal? Or maybe the dc field causes a shift such that both fields are resonant?\n\nWait, let me think again. The absorption probability is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element multiplied by the Lorentzian lineshape (which is maximum at resonance). Therefore, for the absorption probability to be maximum, each field must be on resonance with the transition. If both fields are on resonance, then their absorption probabilities would be proportional to |<2p|d·E|1s>|², where d is the dipole moment operator. However, the dc field might cause a shift in the energy levels, so the resonance condition for each field would require their frequencies to match the shifted transition energy. However, the question states that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal. Therefore, the frequencies w1 and w2 must be such that they both match the shifted transition energy. However, since the problem is asking for w2, given that w1 is adjusted accordingly, perhaps the dc field causes a shift that makes the transition energy different, and we need to find w2 in terms of E0, e, a0, etc.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Let's consider the transition matrix elements. The first field is linearly polarized along z, propagating in x. The polarization vector is along z, so the electric field vector is along z. The second field is circularly polarized propagating in z, so its polarization is circular (which could be either right or left-handed). The transition matrix element depends on the polarization of the field.\n\nFor the 1s → 2p transition, the dipole selection rules are Δl=±1, Δm=0, ±1. The first field is linearly polarized along z, so it corresponds to a π-polarized light. This would induce transitions with Δm=0. The second field is circularly polarized, propagating in z, which corresponds to σ± polarization. For a circularly polarized field propagating in z, the polarization is such that it induces Δm=±1 transitions. However, the 1s state has m=0 (since l=0). Therefore, the circularly polarized field (σ+ or σ-) would induce transitions to 2p states with m=+1 or -1. However, the linearly polarized field (along z) would induce a transition to the 2p m=0 state.\n\nBut in the presence of a dc electric field along z, the 2p states (which have different m values) might have different energy shifts. Wait, the dc electric field breaks the spherical symmetry and introduces a preferred axis (z-axis). Therefore, the degeneracy between the 2p states with different m values is lifted. However, the dc field causes a linear Stark shift for the 2p states. Wait, earlier we saw that the first-order Stark effect for individual states is zero, but when considering the degenerate manifold, the energy shifts are non-zero. But how does that affect the individual m states?\n\nActually, when you apply an electric field along z, the 2p states mix with other states in the n=2 manifold (like 2s), leading to new eigenstates which are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations. However, for the 1s → 2p transition, the dc field might shift the energy of the 2p states. The exact amount of shift depends on the mixing between 2s and 2p states due to the electric field. The energy shift for the 2p state in the presence of the electric field would be something like ΔE = ±(e E0) * d, where d is the induced dipole moment. But I need to recall the exact formula for the Stark shift in hydrogen.\n\nThe first-order Stark effect for hydrogen occurs because of the degeneracy. For n=2, the 2s and 2p states are degenerate. The perturbation is H' = -e E z. The matrix elements between 2s and 2p states are non-zero. Let me recall that the Stark shift for hydrogen is given by ΔE = ± α E, where α is the polarizability. But wait, the polarizability is a second-order effect. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the first-order Stark effect, for degenerate states, the energy shifts are linear in E. However, for non-degenerate states, the first-order shift is zero. But for hydrogen, because of the accidental degeneracy, you can have first-order shifts. However, for the 1s state (non-degenerate), the first-order shift is zero. For the n=2 states, which are degenerate, the first-order energy shifts are non-zero. Therefore, the 2p state (as part of the n=2 manifold) will have its energy shifted by the dc field. The exact value of the shift depends on the mixing between 2s and 2p states.\n\nThe energy shift ΔE for the 2p state due to the dc electric field can be calculated by diagonalizing the perturbation H' = -e E z within the n=2 manifold. The n=2 manifold includes 2s, 2p (with m=-1, 0, +1). However, the perturbation H' connects 2s and 2p states. The matrix elements ⟨2s| -e E z |2p⟩ are non-zero. Let me recall that the matrix element ⟨2s| z |2p_z⟩ is non-zero and has a known value.\n\nIn fact, the matrix element ⟨2s| z |2p_z⟩ is equal to 3 a0 / 2. Wait, let me check. The formula for the Stark shift in hydrogen is ΔE = -e E ⟨z⟩, but since ⟨z⟩ is zero for individual states, but when mixing occurs, the shift is given by the expectation value of the perturbation in the new eigenstates.\n\nAlternatively, the first-order energy shift for the n=2 states in hydrogen under a dc electric field E is given by ΔE = ± 3 e a0 E / 2. Wait, I need to recall the exact expression. Let me think. The linear Stark effect for hydrogen has the energy shift proportional to E. For the n=2 level, the splitting is 3 e a0 E / 2. Therefore, the two states in the n=2 manifold split into two levels with energy shifts +3 e a0 E / 2 and -3 e a0 E / 2. However, this is for the states that are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of 2s and 2p_z.\n\nTherefore, if the original 2p_z state mixes with the 2s state, the new eigenstates will have energies shifted by ± (3 e a0 E / 2). But how does this affect the 1s → 2p transition? The 1s state is still at its original energy, while the 2p state (which was part of the n=2 manifold) is now split. However, the 1s → 2p transition would now have different possible transitions depending on the polarization of the light.\n\nWait, the first field is linearly polarized along z, so it couples to the 2p_z (m=0) state. However, due to the dc field, this state is mixed with the 2s state, leading to new states with shifted energies. The second field is circularly polarized propagating in z, so it couples to the 2p m=±1 states. These states are not affected by the dc field in the same way because they don't mix with the 2s state (since the perturbation H' = -e E z doesn't connect 2s with 2p m=±1). Therefore, the 2p m=±1 states remain at their original energy (no first-order shift), while the 2p m=0 state is shifted.\n\nWait, is that true? The perturbation H' = -e E z connects 2s with 2p_z (m=0), but not with 2p m=±1. Therefore, the 2p m=±1 states are not mixed with any other states in the n=2 manifold by this perturbation. Therefore, their energy remains the same (no first-order shift). Therefore, the 2p m=0 state is shifted by ±3 e a0 E / 2, while the 2p m=±1 states remain unshifted.\n\nTherefore, the transition energy for the 1s → 2p m=0 state is now shifted by ΔE = ±3 e a0 E / 2, while the transition energy for 1s → 2p m=±1 remains the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the first field (linear polarization along z) couples to the shifted 2p m=0 state, so its resonance frequency w1 must be adjusted by the Stark shift. The second field (circular polarization along z) couples to the unshifted 2p m=±1 states, so its resonance frequency w2 remains the original transition frequency.\n\nBut the problem says that with the dc field applied, the absorption probabilities of both fields are maximum and equal. This suggests that both fields must be resonant with the same transition energy. However, if one transition is shifted and the other isn't, how can they be equal? Unless the dc field causes some other effect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The original transition frequency between 1s and 2p is ΔE_0 = E_2p - E_1s. With the dc field applied, the 2p m=0 state is shifted by ΔE = ±3 e a0 E / 2, while the 2p m=±1 states are not shifted. Therefore, the transition energy for the first field (which couples to 2p m=0) is now ΔE_0 ± 3 e a0 E / 2. The transition energy for the second field (which couples to 2p m=±1) remains ΔE_0. Therefore, if the first field is tuned to w1 = (ΔE_0 ± 3 e a0 E / 2)/ħ and the second field is tuned to w2 = ΔE_0 / ħ, then they would be resonant with their respective transitions. However, the problem states that both absorption probabilities are maximum and equal. Therefore, this suggests that both fields are resonant with the same transition energy, which would require that the Stark shift somehow makes both transitions have the same energy. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the dc field causes a shift in the 1s state? Earlier, I thought that the first-order Stark shift for the 1s state is zero. However, maybe there is a second-order effect? The second-order Stark effect for the 1s state would involve virtual transitions to other states. But that would be a much smaller effect. However, the problem mentions a dc field, so maybe the shift is due to the dc field causing a shift in the 1s state?\n\nWait, but the first-order shift for the 1s state is zero because it's non-degenerate. The second-order shift would be non-zero but typically much smaller. However, in this problem, since the answer options are proportional to e a0 E0, which is linear in E0, it suggests that the shift is linear in E0, i.e., first-order. Therefore, perhaps the 1s state's energy is not shifted, and the 2p m=0 state is shifted. Therefore, for the two fields to have maximum absorption, their frequencies must match the respective transition energies. However, the problem says that the absorption probabilities are equal. This implies that the matrix elements (transition strengths) for both fields are equal when they are on resonance. But the matrix elements depend on the polarization.\n\nThe absorption probability is proportional to |<f|d·E|i>|², where d is the dipole moment operator. For the first field, linear polarization along z, the electric field is along z. The dipole operator d is -e r. So <2p_z|d·E|1s> = -e E1 <2p_z|z|1s>. Similarly, for the second field, which is circularly polarized propagating in z. Circular polarization can be considered as a combination of x and y polarizations with a phase difference. The dipole transition matrix element would involve <2p±1|x∓iy|1s>. However, the matrix elements for these transitions need to be calculated.\n\nLet me recall that the dipole matrix elements for hydrogen transitions. For the 1s → 2p transition, the matrix elements are non-zero only for certain polarizations. For linear polarization along z, the matrix element is non-zero for m=0. For circular polarization along z, the matrix elements are non-zero for m=±1. The magnitude of these matrix elements should be the same due to spherical symmetry. For example, the matrix element <2p_z|z|1s> should have the same magnitude as <2p_x|x|1s> and <2p_y|y|1s>. Therefore, the transition probabilities for the linear and circular polarized fields should be the same if they are both on resonance. However, in our case, the transition for the linear polarized field is shifted due to the dc field, while the circular polarized field's transition is not shifted. Therefore, if we want both fields to have maximum absorption (i.e., be on resonance), then the frequencies must be adjusted accordingly. However, the problem states that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal. This suggests that both transitions are on resonance, and their matrix elements are equal in magnitude. Therefore, the frequencies w1 and w2 must be such that they both match the respective transition energies, and the matrix elements are equal.\n\nBut if the transition energies are different (one is shifted, one is not), how can both be on resonance? Unless the dc field somehow causes both transitions to have the same energy. Wait, but earlier we said that the 2p m=0 state is shifted, while the 2p m=±1 states are not. Therefore, the transition energy for the first field is ΔE1 = ΔE_0 + ΔE_shift, and for the second field is ΔE2 = ΔE_0. For both fields to be on resonance, their frequencies must be w1 = ΔE1 / ħ and w2 = ΔE2 / ħ. However, the problem says that the absorption probabilities are equal. Since the matrix elements for both transitions are the same in magnitude (due to spherical symmetry), the absorption probabilities would be equal if both are on resonance. But the question says that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal, which would happen if both fields are on resonance. However, this would require that w1 and w2 are different. However, the problem is asking for the value of w2 given that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal. This suggests that maybe there is a condition where the shift caused by the dc field makes both transitions have the same energy? But how?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the 2p m=±1 states are not shifted. Let me re-examine the Stark effect in hydrogen. The dc field causes a shift in the 2p m=0 state due to mixing with the 2s state. The 2p m=±1 states do not mix with the 2s state because the perturbation H' = -e E z connects 2s with 2p_z (m=0) only. Therefore, the 2p m=±1 states remain at their original energy. Therefore, the transition energy for the first field (which couples to 2p m=0) is shifted, while the transition energy for the second field (which couples to 2p m=±1) remains the same. Therefore, for both fields to have maximum absorption, their frequencies must be adjusted to match the respective transition energies. However, the problem states that the absorption probabilities are equal. If the matrix elements are the same, then the absorption probabilities would be equal if both are on resonance. However, since the transition energies are different, the frequencies w1 and w2 would be different. However, the problem is asking for w2 given that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal. This suggests that maybe there is another condition where the shift in the 2p m=0 state causes the two transitions to have the same energy? But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the dc field causes a shift not only in the 2p m=0 state but also in the 1s state? Earlier, I thought the first-order shift for 1s is zero, but maybe there's a second-order shift? Let me consider that. The second-order energy shift for the 1s state would be due to virtual transitions to other states. The second-order Stark shift is given by ΔE_1s^(2) = Σ_{n≠1s} [ |⟨n| -e E z |1s⟩|² / (E_1s - E_n) ].\n\nThis is a more complicated calculation, but perhaps for hydrogen, this can be estimated. However, the answer options are proportional to e a0 E0, which is linear in E0, suggesting that the shift is linear in E0, i.e., first-order. Therefore, maybe the second-order shift is negligible compared to the first-order shift of the 2p state? Or perhaps there is another effect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of the dc field causes a shift in the 2p m=±1 states through some other mechanism? For example, if the dc field is not purely along z, but that's not the case here. The dc field is along z. The perturbation H' = -e E z only connects 2s and 2p_z. Therefore, the 2p m=±1 states are not affected by the first-order Stark effect. Therefore, their energies remain the same.\n\nTherefore, going back, if the first field is polarized along z, it couples to the shifted 2p m=0 state, while the second field couples to the unshifted 2p m=±1 states. For both fields to have maximum absorption, their frequencies must be set to the respective transition energies. However, the problem says that the absorption probabilities are equal. Since the matrix elements are the same (due to spherical symmetry), the absorption probabilities would be equal if both are on resonance. Therefore, the frequencies w1 and w2 are different, but the problem is asking for w2 given that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal. This seems contradictory unless there is a specific relation between w1 and w2.\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that the dc field causes the transition energy for both fields to be the same, hence requiring w1 = w2. If that's the case, then the shift in the 2p m=0 state must compensate for something else. Wait, but the 2p m=±1 states are not shifted. Therefore, to have both transitions have the same energy, the shift in the 2p m=0 state must be zero? But that would require E0=0, which is not the case here. Alternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation in the energy shift.\n\nLet me recall that the linear Stark effect for hydrogen in the n=2 level splits the states into two levels with energy shifts ±3 e a0 E / 2. Therefore, the original degenerate n=2 level splits into two levels separated by 3 e a0 E. Therefore, the transition energy for the first field (coupling to the shifted 2p m=0 state) would be either ΔE_0 + 3 e a0 E / 2 or ΔE_0 - 3 e a0 E / 2, depending on the sign of the shift. However, the second field's transition energy remains ΔE_0. For the absorption probabilities to be equal and maximum, both fields must be on resonance with the same transition energy. This can happen if the dc field causes the shifted 2p m=0 state to align with the unshifted 2p m=±1 states. Wait, but the 2p m=±1 states are part of the n=2 manifold and are not shifted. However, the shifted 2p m=0 state is part of a new eigenstate that is a combination of 2s and 2p_z. Therefore, perhaps the transition from 1s to this new eigenstate has a different energy, and the transition from 1s to the 2p m=±1 states has the original energy. To make both fields resonate with the same energy, we need the shifted energy of the first transition to be equal to the original energy of the second transition. Or vice versa.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's denote the original transition energy as ΔE_0 = E_2p - E_1s. With the dc field applied, the energy of the new eigenstate (which is a combination of 2s and 2p_z) is shifted by ±3 e a0 E / 2. Let's assume the shift is positive for one state and negative for the other. Therefore, the two new energy levels are at E_2p + 3 e a0 E / 2 and E_2p - 3 e a0 E / 2. The transition energy for the first field (coupling to the shifted state) would be either ΔE_0 + 3 e a0 E / 2 or ΔE_0 - 3 e a0 E / 2. The transition energy for the second field remains ΔE_0.\n\nFor both fields to have maximum absorption, their frequencies must match the respective transition energies. However, the problem says that the absorption probabilities are equal. If both are on resonance, their probabilities are equal because the matrix elements are the same. However, the frequencies would be different. But the question is asking for w2, which is the frequency of the second field. Given that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal, this suggests that both fields are on resonance, and their matrix elements are equal. Therefore, w2 is ΔE_0 / ħ, and w1 is (ΔE_0 ± 3 e a0 E / 2)/ħ. However, the problem is asking for w2 in terms of e a0 E0, which suggests that there is a relation between w2 and the dc field. But if w2 is just the original transition frequency, then it would not depend on E0. However, the answer options all have terms involving E0, so this suggests that my previous reasoning is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the original transition frequency ΔE_0 is not what it used to be? Wait, no. The original transition frequency between 1s and 2p is fixed by the energy levels of hydrogen. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². The 1s state is n=1, 2p is n=2. Therefore, the energy difference is E_2 - E_1 = -13.6/4 - (-13.6/1) = -3.4 + 13.6 = 10.2 eV. This corresponds to a frequency of w0 = ΔE_0 / ħ. This is a fixed value, independent of external fields. Therefore, if the second field's frequency w2 is set to w0, it would be on resonance with the unshifted transition. However, the problem states that with the dc field applied, the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal. This implies that the first field's frequency w1 is adjusted to match the shifted transition, and the second field's frequency w2 is adjusted to match the same shifted transition. Therefore, the dc field must cause the second field's transition to also be shifted, which would require some other mechanism.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of the dc field affects the second field's transition? How? The second field is circularly polarized propagating in z. Its polarization is circular, which corresponds to σ± polarization. The transition it induces is from 1s (m=0) to 2p m=±1. However, the dc field is along z, which breaks the spherical symmetry. Does this affect the energy of the 2p m=±1 states? Earlier, I thought not, because the perturbation H' = -e E z does not connect 2s with 2p m=±1. However, if the 2p m=±1 states are part of the n=2 manifold, which is degenerate with the 2s state, then maybe there are second-order effects?\n\nWait, the second-order Stark effect for the 2p m=±1 states would involve virtual transitions to other states. For example, the 2p m=+1 state could mix with other states in the n=2 manifold through higher-order perturbations. However, this would be a much smaller effect. However, if the dc field is strong enough, maybe this second-order effect becomes significant? But the answer options are linear in E0, suggesting first-order effects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dc field causes a shift in the 1s state through some other mechanism? For example, if the dc field is not static but oscillating? No, the dc field is static. The first-order shift for the 1s state is zero. Therefore, I'm back to the original problem: if the second field's transition is not shifted, then its frequency w2 must be w0, independent of E0, but the answer options involve E0, so this suggests that my reasoning is missing something.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem says that both em fields are applied on the 1s → 2p transition. The first field is linearly polarized along z, propagating in x. The second is circularly polarized, propagating in z. The dc field is along z. The absorption probability of both fields will be maximum and equal if w2 is given by... \n\nMaybe the dc field affects the transition matrix elements for the second field? For example, the presence of the dc field could change the effective dipole moment for the transition induced by the second field. However, the transition matrix element depends on the unperturbed states, so unless the dc field changes the states themselves, which it does through mixing, but for the 2p m=±1 states, which are not mixed with other states in first-order, their wavefunctions remain the same. Therefore, the matrix element for the second field should remain the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dc field causes a shift in the 2p m=±1 states through some other perturbation? For example, if the dc field causes a shift in the 1s state? As discussed earlier, the first-order shift for the 1s state is zero, but maybe there is a second-order shift?\n\nLet me calculate the second-order energy shift for the 1s state due to the dc field. The second-order shift is given by ΔE_1s^(2) = Σ_{n≠1s} [ |⟨n| -e E z |1s⟩|² / (E_1s - E_n) ].\n\nThe dominant contribution would come from the n=2 states, since they are closest in energy. For hydrogen, E_1s = -13.6 eV, E_2 = -3.4 eV. The denominator for the n=2 states is E_1s - E_2 = -13.6 - (-3.4) = -10.2 eV = -1.632 × 10⁻¹⁷ J (converting eV to joules). The numerator is |⟨n=2| -e E z |1s⟩|². The matrix element ⟨2| z |1s⟩ is known. For hydrogen, the matrix element ⟨2s| z |1s⟩ is zero because they are both s states (spherically symmetric). The matrix element ⟨2p| z |1s⟩ is non-zero, as discussed earlier. Specifically, ⟨2p_z| z |1s⟩ = 3 a0 / 2 * something? Let me recall the exact value.\n\nThe dipole matrix element for hydrogen between 1s and 2p states is given by ⟨2p| r |1s⟩. The exact value is known. For hydrogen, the radial integral for the 1s → 2p transition is:\n\n⟨R_2p(r) | r | R_1s(r)⟩ = 3 a0 / 2.\n\nTherefore, ⟨2p_z| z |1s⟩ = 3 a0 / 2 * something? Wait, the full matrix element is -e times this? No, the dipole operator is -e r. So the matrix element ⟨2p_z| -e z |1s⟩ = -e * ⟨2p_z| z |1s⟩ = -e * (3 a0 / 2) * something? Let me check units. The matrix element has units of charge × length. Let me recall the exact value.\n\nActually, the matrix element ⟨2p| r |1s⟩ for hydrogen is (3 a0)/2. Therefore, ⟨2p_z| z |1s⟩ = (3 a0)/2. Therefore, the second-order energy shift for the 1s state due to the dc field would involve the sum over n=2 states. However, the n=2 states include 2s and 2p. The matrix element ⟨2s| z |1s⟩ is zero, as both are s states. The matrix element ⟨2p| z |1s⟩ is non-zero, as above. Therefore, the second-order shift is:\n\nΔE_1s^(2) = [ |⟨2p| -e E z |1s⟩|² / (E_1s - E_2) ].\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔE_1s^(2) = [ (-e E * (3 a0 / 2))² / (E_1s - E_2) ].\n\nWait, but this is just for the 2p state. However, there are three 2p states (m=-1, 0, +1), but since the perturbation is proportional to z, only the 2p_z state (m=0) will contribute. The other 2p states (m=±1) have matrix elements ⟨2p±1| z |1s⟩ = 0, because z is proportional to Y_1⁰, and the overlap with Y_1±1 would be zero. Therefore, only the 2p_z state contributes to this second-order shift.\n\nTherefore, ΔE_1s^(2) = [ (e² E² (3 a0 / 2)²) / (E_1s - E_2) ].\n\nBut E_1s - E_2 is negative, so this would give a negative value. However, this is the second-order shift for the 1s state. The energy of the 1s state is lowered (or raised?) depending on the sign. However, this shift is second-order and typically much smaller than the first-order shift for the 2p state. But given that the answer options are linear in E0, this suggests that the second-order shift is not the intended mechanism here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first-order shift for the 2p m=±1 states due to some other reason. For example, if the dc field causes a shift in the 2p m=±1 states through a different perturbation? But the perturbation is still H' = -e E z, which doesn't connect to those states.\n\nWait, another thought: the dc electric field might cause a shift in the 2p m=±1 states through the quadratic Stark effect. The quadratic Stark effect is second-order and present even for non-degenerate states. However, this would be proportional to E², which is not the case here since the answer options are linear in E.\n\nGiven that the answer options are linear in E0, I think the correct approach is to consider the first-order shift of the 2p m=0 state and relate it to the frequencies of the fields. If both fields are to have maximum absorption, their frequencies must match the respective transition energies. However, the problem states that the absorption probabilities are equal. Since the matrix elements are the same, this implies that both transitions are on resonance, hence their frequencies must match the respective transition energies. But since one transition is shifted and the other isn't, this would require that the dc field causes both transitions to have the same energy. This seems only possible if the shift in the 2p m=0 state is zero, which would require E0=0, but that's not the case. Therefore, there must be another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the energy shift but about the polarization and direction of the fields affecting the transition probabilities in such a way that with the dc field applied, the matrix elements become equal? For example, the dc field might mix the 2p m=0 state with the 2s state, changing the transition matrix element for the first field, while the second field's matrix element remains the same. If the dc field causes the transition matrix element for the first field to decrease, and the second field's matrix element to increase, such that they become equal, then their absorption probabilities would be equal. This would require calculating the new matrix elements after the mixing.\n\nLet me explore this. The original 2p m=0 state is mixed with the 2s state due to the dc field. The new eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of 2s and 2p_z. Let's denote these new states as |+⟩ and |−⟩. The 1s state remains unchanged. The transition matrix element for the first field (linear polarization along z) would now be ⟨+|d·E|1s⟩ and ⟨−|d·E|1s⟩. The original matrix element ⟨2p_z|d·E|1s⟩ is non-zero, but after mixing with the 2s state, the new matrix elements would be modified.\n\nLet me denote the mixing angle as θ. The new states are |+⟩ = cosθ |2s⟩ + sinθ |2p_z⟩ and |−⟩ = -sinθ |2s⟩ + cosθ |2p_z⟩. The mixing angle θ is determined by diagonalizing the perturbation matrix. For the n=2 manifold, the perturbation matrix in the basis {2s, 2p_z} is:\n\n[⟨2s|H'|2s⟩ ⟨2s|H'|2p_z⟩]\n[⟨2p_z|H'|2s⟩ ⟨2p_z|H'|2p_z⟩]\n\nThe diagonal elements ⟨2s|H'|2s⟩ and ⟨2p_z|H'|2p_z⟩ are zero because ⟨z⟩ is zero for both states. The off-diagonal element is ⟨2s| -e E z |2p_z⟩ = -e E * ⟨2s| z |2p_z⟩ = -e E * (3 a0 / 2). Let's denote this as -e E * (3 a0 / 2) = -V. Therefore, the matrix is:\n\n[0 -V]\n[-V 0]\n\nThe eigenvalues are ±V, and the eigenvectors are (1/√2)(|2s⟩ ± |2p_z⟩). Therefore, the mixing angle θ is 45°, so cosθ = sinθ = 1/√2.\n\nTherefore, the new states are |+⟩ = (|2s⟩ + |2p_z⟩)/√2 and |−⟩ = (|2s⟩ - |2p_z⟩)/√2. The energies of these states are shifted by +V and -V, where V = e E * (3 a0 / 2).\n\nNow, the transition matrix element for the first field (which couples to z-polarized light) is ⟨+|d·E|1s⟩ = ⟨+| -e z E |1s⟩ = (-e E / √2) [⟨2s| z |1s⟩ + ⟨2p_z| z |1s⟩]. But ⟨2s| z |1s⟩ = 0, and ⟨2p_z| z |1s⟩ = 3 a0 / 2. Therefore, this becomes (-e E / √2) * (3 a0 / 2). Similarly, for the |−⟩ state, it would be (-e E / √2) * (-3 a0 / 2) = + (e E / √2) * (3 a0 / 2).\n\nHowever, the original transition matrix element for the 1s → 2p_z transition was ⟨2p_z| -e z E |1s⟩ = -e E * (3 a0 / 2). After mixing, the transition matrix element to the |+⟩ state is reduced by a factor of 1/√2, and the sign depends on the state. Therefore, the transition probability (which is the square of the matrix element) is reduced by a factor of 1/2. Similarly, the transition to the |−⟩ state would have the same magnitude but different phase.\n\nHowever, the second field couples to the 2p m=±1 states, which are not mixed with the 2s state. Therefore, their transition matrix elements remain the same, which is ⟨2p±1| -e (x ∓ iy) E |1s⟩. The magnitude of this matrix element should be the same as the original ⟨2p_z| -e z E |1s⟩, because of spherical symmetry. Let me verify this.\n\nThe dipole matrix elements for hydrogen are such that for the 1s → 2p transition, the magnitude of the matrix elements for all three directions (x, y, z) are the same. Therefore, |⟨2p_x| x |1s⟩| = |⟨2p_y| y |1s⟩| = |⟨2p_z| z |1s⟩| = 3 a0 / 2. Therefore, the transition matrix element for the second field (circular polarization) is the same in magnitude as the original first field. However, after the mixing, the first field's transition matrix element is reduced by a factor of 1/√2.\n\nTherefore, the absorption probability for the first field is proportional to (1/2) |original matrix element|², while the absorption probability for the second field remains proportional to |original matrix element|². To make these equal, we need to adjust the frequencies so that the second field is not on resonance, or some other condition. But the problem states that the absorption probabilities are maximum and equal, which implies both are on resonance. If the first field's matrix element is reduced, then to have equal absorption probabilities, the second field's matrix element must also be reduced, which would require some other mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that with the dc field applied, the 1s → 2p transition can occur through both the shifted |+⟩ and |−⟩ states and the unshifted 2p m=±1 states, and the total absorption probability is the sum of the probabilities for each pathway. However, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's think about the total absorption. For the first field, which couples to z-polarized light, it can only excite the 2p m=0 state, which is now mixed with 2s. The absorption probability for this field is proportional to |⟨+|d·E|1s⟩|² + |⟨−|d·E|1s⟩|², assuming both |+⟩ and |−⟩ are accessible. However, since the |+⟩ and |−⟩ states have different energies (shifted by +V and -V), the absorption would have two peaks at different frequencies. However, the problem states that the absorption probability is maximum, implying that we are considering one of these transitions. If the first field is tuned to the |+⟩ state (frequency w1 = (ΔE_0 + V)/ħ), its absorption probability is proportional to (1/2) |original matrix element|². If the second field is tuned to its original transition (w2 = ΔE_0 / ħ), its absorption probability is proportional to |original matrix element|². For these to be equal, we need (1/2) |original matrix element|² = |original matrix element|², which is not possible unless the original matrix element is zero, which it isn't. Therefore, this suggests that my previous approach is missing something.\n\nPerhaps the question is not about the matrix elements but about the fact that with the dc field applied, the absorption lines are shifted, and to have both fields resonant, their frequencies must be adjusted such that w1 and w2 are set to the shifted and unshifted transitions, and the problem wants the value of w2 in terms of the dc field. But since w2 is the unshifted transition, it would not depend on E0, which contradicts the answer options. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.\n\nLet me revisit the problem statement:\n\n\"Two electromagnetic (em) fields are applied on the 1s->2p transition of a Hydrogen atomic vapor sample. The field#1 is polarized in z-direction, propagating in x-direction, with an amplitude E1, wave vector amplitude k, and frequency w1. The field#2 is circularly polarized, propagating in z-direction, with an amplitude E2, wave vector amplitude k, and frequency w2. Let us now apply a dc electric field with an amplitude E0 along z-direction to this vapor sample. The absorption probability of both the em fields will be maximum and equal, if the frequency w2 is given by...\"\n\nThe key here might be that the dc field causes a shift in the 2p state, and both fields must be tuned to the same shifted frequency. However, how?\n\nIf the dc field shifts the 2p state, then both transitions (for field 1 and field 2) must be adjusted to this new frequency. But field 2's transition is to the 2p m=±1 states, which are not shifted. Therefore, this is only possible if the dc field somehow also shifts these states, which it doesn't in first-order. However, if the dc field is strong enough to cause a second-order shift in these states, then maybe both transitions are shifted. Let's calculate the second-order shift for the 2p m=±1 states.\n\nThe second-order energy shift for the 2p m=+1 state would be ΔE_2p±1^(2) = Σ_{n≠2p} [ |⟨n| H' |2p±1⟩|² / (E_2p - E_n) ].\n\nThe dominant contribution would come from the 2s state. The matrix element ⟨2s| H' |2p±1⟩ is zero because H' = -e E z, and the 2p±1 states have angular parts that involve x ± iy, which do not have a z-component. Therefore, the matrix element ⟨2s| -e E z |2p±1⟩ is zero. Hence, the second-order shift is zero. Therefore, the 2p m=±1 states have no second-order shift either.\n\nThis brings us back to the original problem: the only shift is for the 2p m=0 state, and the other transitions are unaffected. Therefore, for both fields to have maximum absorption, their frequencies must be set to the respective transition energies. However, the problem says that the absorption probabilities are equal. Since the matrix elements are the same, this would mean that both fields are on resonance, but with different frequencies. However, the question is asking for w2, which is the frequency of the second field. Given that the answer options involve E0, it must be that the second field's frequency is related to the dc field. This suggests that my previous analysis is missing a key insight.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the energy shift but about the Doppler effect or something else? No, the problem is about static electric field and electromagnetic fields, so Doppler is not relevant here.\n\nAnother angle: the absorption probability is maximum when the field is resonant with the transition. The presence of the dc field causes a shift in the transition frequency for the first field. To have both fields have maximum absorption, their frequencies must match the new transition frequencies. However, the problem states that the absorption probabilities are equal. This could mean that the transition probabilities (oscillator strengths) for both fields are equal, which might be the case if the dc field causes the matrix elements to become equal. But earlier, we saw that the matrix element for the first field is reduced by a factor of 1/√2, while the second field's remains the same. To make them equal, we might need to adjust the dc field such that the reduction factor is compensated, but this seems complex.\n\nWait, let's calculate the exact values. The original transition matrix element for both fields is the same, let's say M. After the dc field, the matrix element for the first field is M/√2, and for the second field it remains M. To make the absorption probabilities equal, we need |M/√2|² = |M|², which is not possible unless M=0. This is a contradiction, so there must be a different approach.\n\nMaybe the question is considering the total absorption, including both the shifted and unshifted transitions for the first field? For example, the first field could excite both the shifted |+⟩ and |−⟩ states, while the second field excites the unshifted 2p m=±1 states. The total absorption probability for the first field would be the sum of the probabilities for both transitions, while the second field's probability is for one transition. If we set the frequencies such that both fields are on resonance with their respective transitions, and the total probabilities are equal, then we can find w2.\n\nFor the first field, the absorption probability would be proportional to (1/2) + (1/2) = 1, assuming both |+⟩ and |−⟩ are on resonance. But if the first field is only on resonance with one of them, say |+⟩, then it would be 1/2. If the second field is on resonance with its transition, it would be 1. To make them equal, we need 1/2 = 1, which is not possible. If the first field is on resonance with both |+⟩ and |−⟩, but that would require the field's frequency to match both shifted energies, which are different, which is impossible unless V=0.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let me try to recall if there is a standard result for this type of problem. In the presence of a dc electric field, the 1s → 2p transition splits into different components. The linearly polarized field (along z) couples to the shifted 2p m=0 state, while the circularly polarized field couples to the unshifted 2p m=±1 states. The absorption lines for the first field would be shifted by ±3 e a0 E / 2, while the second field's line remains at the original frequency. For the absorption probabilities to be equal, the intensity of the fields might need to be adjusted, but the problem states that the absorption probabilities are equal, implying that the matrix elements squared are equal. Given that the matrix element for the first field is reduced, this suggests that the dc field must be zero, which is not the case. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the dc field causes a shift in the 1s state through the quadratic Stark effect, and this shift is what is being asked. Let's calculate the second-order shift for the 1s state, even though it's usually small. As calculated earlier, ΔE_1s^(2) = [ (e² E² (3 a0 / 2)²) / (E_1s - E_2) ]. Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, let's convert the energy difference E_1s - E_2 = -10.2 eV. Converting to joules: 1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J, so -10.2 eV = -1.634 × 10⁻¹⁸ J.\n\nThe numerator is e² E² (3 a0 / 2)². Let's denote this as e² E² (9 a0² / 4). \n\nBut the problem is asking for w2 in terms of e a0 E0, so let's see. The frequency w2 would be related to the energy shift. If the 1s state is shifted by ΔE_1s^(2), then the transition energy for the second field would be ΔE_0 + ΔE_1s^(2). However, this is a second-order shift, which is proportional to E², but the answer options are linear in E0. This suggests it's not this.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the correct formula for the linear Stark shift and relate it to the transition frequency. The linear Stark shift for the 2p state is ΔE = ±3 e a0 E / 2. The original transition frequency is w0 = ΔE_0 / ħ. With the dc field, the transition frequency for the first field becomes w1 = (ΔE_0 ± 3 e a0 E / 2)/ħ. For both fields to have maximum absorption, their frequencies must match the respective transitions. If the problem states that the absorption probabilities are equal, and assuming the matrix elements are the same, this would mean that both fields are on resonance. However, since one is shifted and one is not, this is only possible if the shift is zero, which it isn't. Therefore, the only way for both to be on resonance is if the dc field is zero, which is not the case.\n\nGiven that the answer options are all proportional to e a0 E0, and the correct coefficient is likely 3 e a0 E0, which is option A, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, the energy shift for the 2p state is ΔE = 3 e a0 E / 2. The frequency shift would be Δw = ΔE / ħ = (3 e a0 E / 2) / ħ. The original transition frequency is w0 = ΔE_0 / ħ. If the first field is tuned to w1 = w0 + Δw, and the second field is tuned to w2 = w0, then the absorption probabilities would be maximum for each field. However, the problem states that the absorption probabilities are equal. If the matrix elements are the same, this would require that both are on resonance, but since they are at different frequencies, this is not possible. Therefore, there must be a condition where the dc field causes the second field's transition to also be shifted, which would require a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the dc field causing a shift in the 2p state, and both fields are tuned to this new frequency. For the second field, which couples to the unshifted 2p m=±1 states, to have maximum absorption, its frequency must be set to the new transition frequency, which would require that the 2p m=±1 states are also shifted. But they aren't. This suggests that the only way for both fields to have maximum absorption is if the dc field is zero, which is not the case. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.\n\nMaybe the question is not about the energy shift but about the polarization and direction of the fields affecting the transition in such a way that the dc field makes the matrix elements equal. For example, the dc field could cause a mixing that makes the matrix elements for both fields equal. Let's calculate the matrix elements after the mixing.\n\nAs previously, the new states are |+⟩ and |−⟩. The transition matrix element for the first field (z-polarized) is M1 = ⟨+|d·E|1s⟩ = -e E * (3 a0 / 2) / √2. For the second field, which is circularly polarized, the transition matrix element is M2 = ⟨2p±1|d·E|1s⟩ = -e E * (3 a0 / 2). To make |M1|² = |M2|², we need (1/2) |M2|² = |M2|², which is not possible. Therefore, this approach is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of ideas and the answer options suggest a linear relation, I'll try to recall that the linear Stark shift for the 2p state is 3 e a0 E / 2. If the problem is asking for the frequency w2 such that both fields have maximum absorption, and assuming that the second field's frequency must match the shifted transition, then w2 = w0 + Δw, where Δw = (3 e a0 E / 2) / ħ. But the original transition frequency w0 is 10.2 eV / ħ. However, the problem is asking for w2 in terms of e a0 E0, so likely the answer is 3 e a0 E0, which is option A. But let me check the units.\n\nThe units of e a0 E0 are [C][m][V/m] = [C][m][N/C] = [N·m] = [J]. The frequency has units of [1/s]. To get frequency from energy, we divide by ħ. However, the answer options are given as frequencies, so they must have units of [1/s], but the options are given in terms of e a0 E0, which has units of [J]. Therefore, there must be a missing factor of 1/ħ. But the options are given as frequencies, so it's possible that the actual expression is (3 e a0 E0)/ħ, but the options are written without the ħ, assuming ħ is incorporated into the constants. However, in the given options, the units are not explicitly shown, so we can assume that the correct coefficient is 3, making option A the answer. But let me check if there is a factor I missed.\n\nThe linear Stark shift is ΔE = 3 e a0 E / 2. To get the frequency shift, Δw = ΔE / ħ. If the problem is asking for w2 to be this frequency shift, then w2 = 3 e a0 E0 / (2ħ). But the options are given as 3 e a0 E0, 11.54 e a0 E0, etc., without the 1/ħ. This suggests that the question is using natural units where ħ = 1, or that there is a different derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the electric field strength in terms of frequency, using the relation between the electric field and the frequency shift. However, without more information, it's hard to say. Given that the standard linear Stark shift for hydrogen is 3 e a0 E / 2, and the answer options include 3 e a0 E0 (option A), it's plausible that the correct answer is A. However, I recall that in some contexts, the coefficient might be different, like 5.1 or 8.7, which are numerical factors. Let me think about the exact value.\n\nThe linear Stark effect for hydrogen in the n=2 level splits the states by 3 e a0 E. The energy difference between the two new levels is 3 e a0 E. The original transition frequency is w0 = (E_2 - E_1)/ħ = 10.2 eV / ħ. If the dc field causes a shift in the 2p state, then the new transition frequency for the first field is w1 = w0 ± (3 e a0 E / (2ħ)). For the absorption probabilities to be equal, perhaps the second field must be tuned to this new frequency, hence w2 = w0 ± (3 e a0 E / (2ħ)). If the problem is asking for this frequency in terms of e a0 E, then the coefficient would be 3/2. But none of the options have 1.5, but option A is 3. This suggests that perhaps the correct coefficient is 3, and the missing factor of 2 is due to a different derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the dc field causing a shift in the 1s state through some other mechanism, and the frequency w2 is set to match this. Given that I'm stuck and the options are given, and the standard linear Stark shift is 3 e a0 E / 2, I'll go with option A: 3 e a0 E0, assuming that the factor of 2 is omitted or the question is using a different convention.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
