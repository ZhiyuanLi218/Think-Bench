While excessive or harmful preservatives can be dangerous, **some preservatives are necessary and approved for use** in food to prevent microbial growth, spoilage, and extend shelf life. Examples include natural preservatives like salt and vinegar, as well as regulated chemical preservatives like sodium benzoate. The statement is overly absolute and not scientifically accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: \"Burying used batteries does not cause environmental pollution\"**  \nThis is also **incorrect**. Used batteries contain **toxic heavy metals** such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. When buried, these metals can **leach into the soil and groundwater**, contaminating the environment and posing serious health risks. Proper recycling and disposal of batteries are essential to prevent pollution.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: \"Incomplete combustion of natural gas produces toxic gases\"**  \nThis statement is **correct**. Natural gas is primarily composed of **methane (CH₄)**. When it burns **completely**, it produces **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** and **water (H₂O)**. However, in the case of **incomplete combustion**, due to insufficient oxygen, it can produce **carbon monoxide (CO)**, a **toxic gas** that is harmful to human health and the environment. This makes the statement scientifically accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: \"Using phosphate-containing detergents does not cause water pollution\"**  \nThis is **incorrect**. Phosphates in detergents can **enter water systems** through runoff and sewage. They act as **nutrients**, leading to **eutrophication**—a process where excessive algal growth depletes oxygen in water, harming aquatic life. Many countries have banned or restricted phosphate-containing detergents due to these environmental concerns.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Correct Answer: (C) Incomplete combustion of natural gas produces toxic gases**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about chemistry related to human health and environmental protection, and I need to pick the correct statements from the options given. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: \"No preservatives may be added during food processing.\" Hmm, I know that preservatives are used in food to prevent spoilage and extend shelf life. But are they allowed? I think in many countries, certain preservatives are approved for use as long as they're within safe limits. So if the statement says \"no preservatives may be added,\" that sounds too absolute. For example, things like salt or vinegar are natural preservatives, but maybe they're talking about chemical ones. But I don't think it's true that none can be added. So A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"Burying used batteries does not cause environmental pollution.\" Wait, batteries contain heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium, right? If you bury them, over time they can leach into the soil and groundwater, causing pollution. I remember that proper disposal of batteries is important because of this. So B is saying it doesn't cause pollution, which is false. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"Incomplete combustion of natural gas produces toxic gases.\" Natural gas is mainly methane (CH4). When it burns completely, it produces CO2 and H2O. But if there's incomplete combustion, meaning not enough oxygen, it can produce carbon monoxide (CO) instead of CO2. Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas. So yes, incomplete combustion of natural gas would produce CO, which is toxic. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: \"Using phosphate-containing detergents does not cause water pollution.\" Phosphates in detergents can lead to eutrophication in water bodies. When they wash into rivers or lakes, they act as nutrients, causing excessive growth of algae. This leads to algal blooms, which deplete oxygen in the water when they die and decompose, harming aquatic life. So using phosphate-containing detergents does contribute to water pollution. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>"}
