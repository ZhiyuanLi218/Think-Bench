The question is asking which of the substances listed has an incorrect chemical composition. The options are A to D. I need to figure out which one is wrong.\n\nStarting with option A: Quicklime is given as Ca(OH)₂. Wait, I remember that quicklime is calcium oxide, which is CaO. But calcium hydroxide is slaked lime, right? So if the question says quicklime is Ca(OH)₂, that's incorrect. Quicklime is CaO, and when you add water to it, it becomes slaked lime, which is Ca(OH)₂. So A is wrong. But let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B: Barite is BaSO₄. Barite is another name for barium sulfate. Yes, barium has a +2 charge, sulfate is SO₄²⁻, so combining them gives BaSO₄. That seems correct.\n\nOption C: Urea is CO(NH₂)₂. Urea's formula is usually written as (NH₂)₂CO. The structure is a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to two NH₂ groups. So CO(NH₂)₂ is the same as (NH₂)₂CO. So that's correct. So option C is right.\n\nOption D: Oxalic acid is HOOC-COOH. Oxalic acid is a dicarboxylic acid with two carboxyl groups. The formula is HOOCCOOH, which can also be written as HOOC-COOH. So that's correct. The structure is two -COOH groups connected directly. So D is correct.\n\nSo the incorrect one is option A. Quicklime is CaO, not Ca(OH)₂. The Ca(OH)₂ is slaked lime. So the answer is A.\n</think>"}
