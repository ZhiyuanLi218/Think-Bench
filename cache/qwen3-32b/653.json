This indicates that the process is **endothermic**, as the system absorbs heat from the surroundings. A key concept here is that **spontaneity** of a process is determined by the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), which is governed by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\Delta G$ is the change in Gibbs free energy.\n- $\\Delta H$ is the enthalpy change (positive for endothermic processes).\n- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n- $\\Delta S$ is the entropy change (positive for an increase in entropy).\n\n---\n\n### Analyzing the Options:\n\n- **Option A and D** state that the process is spontaneous because it is *exothermic*. This is incorrect because the temperature of the solution *decreases*, indicating the process is *endothermic*, not exothermic.\n\n- **Option C** claims the process is spontaneous due to an *entropy decrease*. A negative entropy change (decrease in entropy) would make $\\Delta S$ negative. If $\\Delta H$ is also positive (as in an endothermic process), the result would be a **positive $\\Delta G$**, which means the process is **not spontaneous**. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.\n\n- **Option B** states that the process is spontaneous due to an **entropy increase**. This is the correct explanation. An increase in entropy (positive $\\Delta S$) can compensate for a positive $\\Delta H$, making $\\Delta G$ negative and the process spontaneous. This is consistent with the observed endothermic dissolution of KClO₄, which is still a spontaneous process due to a favorable entropy change.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about potassium perchlorate dissolving in water and the temperature of the solution being lower than the initial temperature. So, the temperature goes down, which means the process is endothermic, right? Because when something dissolves and the temperature decreases, it's absorbing heat from the surroundings. So the dissolution of KClO4 in water is endothermic.\n\nNow, the question asks which conclusion is related to this. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says it's a spontaneous process because it's exothermic. But wait, we just determined that the process is endothermic since the temperature decreased. So exothermic would be if the temperature increased. So A is probably wrong because the process is endothermic, not exothermic. So A and D, which also says it's exothermic, can be eliminated.\n\nThat leaves B and C. Both are about entropy. Spontaneity is determined by the Gibbs free energy equation: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. For a process to be spontaneous, ΔG must be negative. If the process is endothermic (ΔH is positive), then the entropy change (ΔS) must be positive enough such that TΔS > ΔH, making ΔG negative.\n\nSo if dissolving KClO4 is endothermic but still spontaneous, then the entropy must be increasing. Because an increase in entropy (positive ΔS) would contribute to a negative ΔG even if ΔH is positive. So option B says it's spontaneous because of an entropy increase. Option C says it's because of an entropy decrease, which would make ΔS negative. If ΔS is negative and ΔH is positive, then ΔG would definitely be positive, so the process wouldn't be spontaneous. So C is out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. The process is spontaneous despite being endothermic because the entropy increase is significant enough to drive the spontaneity.\n</think>"}
