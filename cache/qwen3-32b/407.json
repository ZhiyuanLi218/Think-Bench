Hmm, let me recall how electric field and electric potential are related. \n\nI remember that the electric potential difference between two points is the negative integral of the electric field from the initial point to the final point. The formula is ΔV = -∫ E · dr. But wait, here the electric field is given as a function of the radial distance r, so I need to be careful about the path of integration. Since the electric field is radial, I think the potential difference depends only on the radial distance, but the point (3,4) isn't along the radial line from the origin unless we consider polar coordinates. Wait, maybe I need to convert the point (3,4) into polar coordinates to find its radial distance from the origin?\n\nLet me check. The point (3,4) in Cartesian coordinates is at a distance r = sqrt(3² + 4²) = 5 meters from the origin. So the radial distance is 5 meters. But the electric field is given as a function of r, so maybe the potential difference from the origin (r=0) to r=5 is what we need?\n\nBut hold on, the potential difference depends on the path if the electric field is non-conservative, but electric fields from static charges are conservative, so the integral should be path-independent. However, since the electric field here is given as a function of r, I assume it's a radial field, so integrating along the radial path from 0 to 5 meters should be sufficient.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4)\", which is at radius 5. So integrating from r=0 to r=5. But let me make sure. The electric field is given as Er(r), so it's a function of radial distance, and assuming it's spherically symmetric? Or maybe it's in two dimensions? The problem mentions \"radius away from origin\", so maybe it's in 2D? But regardless, the radial distance from origin to (3,4) is 5 meters. So integrating from 0 to 5.\n\nBut then why is the point (3,4) given? Maybe to trick us? Because if the electric field only depends on r, then regardless of direction, the potential difference between origin and any point at radius r is the same? So yes, if the electric field is radial and only depends on r, then the potential difference between origin and any point at radius r is the same as integrating from 0 to r. So I can just compute the integral from 0 to 5 of E(r) dr, and take the negative of that?\n\nWait, the formula is ΔV = V_final - V_initial = -∫ E · dr from initial to final. So if we go from origin (initial) to (3,4) (final), then ΔV = V(5) - V(0) = -∫ from 0 to 5 of E(r) dr. Assuming that E is radial and we are moving along radial direction, so E · dr is just E(r) dr. Therefore, ΔV = -∫₀⁵ E(r) dr.\n\nBut let me check the sign. If the electric field is in the radial direction, then the potential decreases in the direction of the electric field. But since we are integrating from 0 to 5, and E is given as Er, which is the radial component. So if Er is positive, the field is pointing radially outward, and moving against the field would increase potential. But regardless, the formula is ΔV = -∫ E · dr. So if I compute that integral, I should get the answer.\n\nSo let me compute the integral of E(r) from 0 to 5. Let me write down the integral:\n\nΔV = -∫₀⁵ [ -6r² + 4r + 3 ] dr\n\nLet me compute the integral step by step.\n\nFirst, integrate term by term:\n\nIntegral of -6r² dr is -6*(r³/3) = -2r³\n\nIntegral of 4r dr is 4*(r²/2) = 2r²\n\nIntegral of 3 dr is 3r\n\nSo putting it all together, the integral from 0 to 5 is:\n\n[ -2r³ + 2r² + 3r ] evaluated from 0 to 5.\n\nAt r=5:\n\n-2*(5)^3 + 2*(5)^2 + 3*(5) = -2*(125) + 2*(25) + 15 = -250 + 50 + 15 = -185\n\nAt r=0, all terms are 0, so subtracting 0. Therefore, the integral is -185. Then ΔV = -(-185) = 185 volts. But wait, looking at the options, 185 V is option D. But let me check if I did the signs correctly.\n\nWait, ΔV = - ∫ E · dr. The integral of E · dr from 0 to 5 is [ -2r³ + 2r² + 3r ] from 0 to 5, which is -185. Therefore ΔV is -(-185) = +185 V. So the potential difference V(5) - V(0) is +185 volts. But wait, if the question is asking for the potential difference between the origin and the point (3,4), which is V(3,4) - V(0). Assuming that V(0) is the potential at origin, and V(5) is the potential at radius 5. So if ΔV = V(5) - V(0) = +185 V, then the potential at (3,4) is 185 volts higher than at the origin. So the answer would be D: 185 V. But let me check again.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The problem says \"the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4)\". Depending on convention, sometimes potential difference is asked as V_final - V_initial. If the origin is the initial point and (3,4) is the final, then it's V(3,4) - V(0) = +185 V. So answer D. However, maybe I messed up the sign in the integral?\n\nLet me recall: The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential. In one dimension, E = -dV/dr. Therefore, dV = -E dr. Therefore, integrating from a to b, V(b) - V(a) = -∫ₐᵇ E dr. Therefore, yes, ΔV = -∫ E dr. Therefore, if I calculated the integral of E dr from 0 to 5 as -185, then ΔV is -(-185) = +185. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check my integral again. Let me recompute:\n\nIntegral of E(r) dr from 0 to 5:\n\n∫ (-6r² + 4r + 3) dr = ?\n\nIntegral of -6r² is -6*(r³/3) = -2r³\n\nIntegral of +4r is +4*(r²/2) = +2r²\n\nIntegral of +3 is +3r\n\nSo overall, the antiderivative is -2r³ + 2r² + 3r. Evaluated at 5:\n\n-2*(125) + 2*(25) + 3*(5) = -250 + 50 + 15 = -185. Correct. At 0, it's 0. So the integral is -185. Then ΔV is -(-185) = 185 V. Therefore, answer D: 185 V.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A: –165 V, B: –120 V, C:64 V, D:185 V. So D is an option. But wait, the problem says \"the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4)\". Depending on how it's defined, sometimes potential difference can be asked as V_origin - V_point, but usually it's V_final - V_initial. If you move from origin to (3,4), then it's V(3,4) - V(origin) which is +185 V. So answer D. But let me check once more if there's a mistake in assuming the path.\n\nWait, is the electric field given as a function of r, but is the field radial? The question says \"the electric field varies with the radius away from origin by the equation Er = –6r² + 4r + 3\". So Er is the radial component. Therefore, the electric field is purely radial, so the potential depends only on r, and the potential difference between two points only depends on their radial distances. Therefore, integrating from 0 to 5 meters is correct. Therefore, answer D. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the electric field? Let me check again. The formula is ΔV = -∫ E · dr. If we move from 0 to 5, dr is in the radial direction, same as Er. Therefore, the dot product is positive. So the integral is positive. But in our case, the integral of E dr from 0 to 5 is -185. So ΔV is -(-185) = +185. So that seems correct. Let me take a concrete example. Suppose E is positive, then moving in the direction of E would mean that the potential decreases. But in our case, depending on r, E(r) can be positive or negative. Let me check the value of E(r) at some points. For example, at r=0, E is -6*(0) + 4*(0) + 3 = 3 N/C, radially. Since Er is positive, that means the electric field is pointing radially outward at r=0. But potential decreases in the direction of the electric field. So moving in the direction of E (outward from origin) would mean potential decreases. However, depending on the integral, the total change could be positive or negative. But in our case, the integral of E from 0 to 5 is -185, so ΔV is +185. So that would mean that the potential at 5m is higher than at 0m by 185 V. Which would be the case if, overall, the electric field did negative work moving from 0 to 5, hence potential increases. \n\nBut let me check with a simple case. Suppose E is constant, say E = -k r hat. Then integrating E dr would give something. But maybe I don't need to. My calculation seems consistent. So unless there's a miscalculation in the integral, which I checked again:\n\n-2*(5^3) + 2*(5^2) + 3*(5) = -2*125 + 2*25 + 15 = -250 + 50 + 15 = -185. Correct. So ΔV is +185 V. Therefore, answer D.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A: –165 V, B: –120 V, C:64 V, D:185 V. So D is there. So why is the answer not negative? Let me think again. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the potential difference as V_origin - V(3,4), which would be -185 V. But the options don't have -185, but D is +185. However, the question says \"the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4)\". Typically, potential difference ΔV is defined as V_final - V_initial. If you move from origin to (3,4), then ΔV is V(3,4) - V(origin) = +185 V. However, sometimes people might phrase it as \"potential difference at origin compared to (3,4)\", which would be the opposite. But according to standard notation, ΔV = V_final - V_initial. So if the question is from origin to (3,4), then answer is D. However, maybe the question is in another convention? For example, in some contexts, the potential difference between A and B is V_A - V_B. Let me check the exact wording: \"the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4)\". Usually, \"between A and B\" can be ambiguous, but in physics problems, it's usually specified as \"from A to B\" or \"between A and B\", which is V_B - V_A if you go from A to B. However, without more context, but given that the answer options include +185, which is D, and my calculation leads to that, I think D is correct. \n\nBut let me check once more the integral. Maybe I messed up the sign in the formula. The relation between electric field and potential is E = -dV/dr. Therefore, dV = -E dr. Therefore, integrating from r_initial to r_final:\n\nV_final - V_initial = - ∫ E dr from r_initial to r_final. Which is what I did. So yes, if I compute that integral, then the answer is +185 V. Therefore, answer D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in 2D and the electric field is not purely radial? Wait, the problem says \"the electric field varies with the radius away from origin by the equation Er = –6r² + 4r + 3\". So Er is the radial component. So in polar coordinates, the electric field is E(r) r_hat. Therefore, it is radial. Therefore, the potential only depends on r, so regardless of the angular position, the potential at radius r is the same. Therefore, the potential difference between origin and (3,4) is same as between origin and (5,0), etc. So integrating from 0 to 5 is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct, D: 185 V. However, let me check if there is any possible mistake in the problem. For example, maybe the electric field is given in Cartesian coordinates? But the problem says \"varies with the radius away from origin\", so it's a function of radial distance. Therefore, it's in polar coordinates. So integrating along radial direction is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the electric field is given in terms of x, y, or something else? But no, the problem says \"Er = –6r² + 4r + 3\", where r is given in meters. So r is the radial coordinate. Therefore, integrating from 0 to 5 meters. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D: 185 V. However, let me check if I have a miscalculation. Let me recompute the integral:\n\nCompute ∫₀⁵ (-6r² + 4r + 3) dr:\n\nAntiderivative:\n\n-6*(r³/3) + 4*(r²/2) + 3*r = -2r³ + 2r² + 3r.\n\nAt r=5:\n\n-2*(125) + 2*(25) + 3*(5) = -250 + 50 + 15 = -185. Correct. \n\nTherefore, ΔV = -(-185) = 185 V. \n\nYes, so answer D. Therefore, I think the correct answer is D: 185 V.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
