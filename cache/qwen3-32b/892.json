The balanced equation is given: 2N₂H₄(l) + N₂O₄(l) → 3N₂(g) + 4H₂O(l). Alright, let me start by recalling how stoichiometry works.\n\nFirst, I think I need to convert the mass of N₂H₄ to moles. To do that, I need the molar mass of N₂H₄. Let me calculate that. Nitrogen has a molar mass of about 14.01 g/mol, and hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol. So for N₂H₄: 2*14.01 + 4*1.008. Let me compute that.\n\n2*14.01 is 28.02 g/mol for nitrogen. Then 4*1.008 is 4.032 g/mol for hydrogen. Adding them together: 28.02 + 4.032 = 32.052 g/mol. So the molar mass of N₂H₄ is 32.052 g/mol. \n\nNow, converting 10.81 grams of N₂H₄ to moles. Moles = mass / molar mass. So that's 10.81 g / 32.052 g/mol. Let me do this division. Hmm, 10.81 divided by 32.052. Let me approximate. Well, 32 goes into 10.81... maybe around 0.337 moles? Let me check with a calculator step.\n\nAlternatively, 32.052 g/mol is approximately 32 g/mol. 10.81 / 32 is roughly 0.3378 moles. But let me do it more accurately. Let me compute 10.81 / 32.052.\n\nFirst, 32.052 * 0.3 = 9.6156. Subtract that from 10.81: 10.81 - 9.6156 = 1.1944. Then, how much more? Let's see, 32.052 * 0.03 = 0.96156. So 0.3 + 0.03 = 0.33. Subtract 0.96156 from 1.1944: 1.1944 - 0.96156 = 0.23284. Now, 0.23284 / 32.052 ≈ 0.00726. So total moles ≈ 0.33 + 0.00726 ≈ 0.3373 moles. So approximately 0.3373 moles of N₂H₄.\n\nOkay, moving on. Now, according to the balanced equation, 2 moles of N₂H₄ produce 3 moles of N₂. So the mole ratio is 2:3. So I need to find out how many moles of N₂ are produced from 0.3373 moles of N₂H₄.\n\nSo moles of N₂ = (3/2) * moles of N₂H₄. That would be (3/2) * 0.3373 ≈ 1.5 * 0.3373 ≈ 0.50595 moles of N₂.\n\nNow, I need to convert moles of N₂ to grams. The molar mass of N₂ is 28.02 g/mol (since each nitrogen atom is 14.01 g/mol, so 2*14.01 = 28.02). \n\nSo mass of N₂ = moles * molar mass = 0.50595 mol * 28.02 g/mol. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, 0.5 * 28.02 = 14.01 g. Then 0.00595 * 28.02 ≈ 0.1667 g. Adding them together: 14.01 + 0.1667 ≈ 14.1767 g. \n\nHmm, so approximately 14.18 grams. Looking at the options, D is 14.188 grams. That seems very close. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, molar mass of N₂H₄: 2*14.01 + 4*1.008. Let me recalculate. 14.01*2 is 28.02, 1.008*4 is 4.032. Total 28.02 + 4.032 = 32.052 g/mol. Correct.\n\n10.81 g / 32.052 g/mol. Let me do this division more accurately. Let me use decimal division.\n\nLet me write 10.81 divided by 32.052. Let me convert both to the same units. Alternatively, use calculator-like steps.\n\nLet me consider 10.81 / 32.052. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 10810 / 32052 ≈ ?\n\nAlternatively, approximate using calculator steps. Let me use a better method.\n\nLet me use the formula:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass = 10.81 / 32.052 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 32.052 * 0.337 = ?\n\nLet me compute 32.052 * 0.3 = 9.6156\n\n32.052 * 0.03 = 0.96156\n\n32.052 * 0.007 = 0.224364\n\nAdding those: 9.6156 + 0.96156 = 10.57716 + 0.224364 ≈ 10.8015 g. Which is very close to 10.81 g. So 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.007 = 0.337. The actual value is 10.81 / 32.052 ≈ 0.337 + (10.81 - 10.8015)/32.052 ≈ 0.337 + 0.0085/32.052 ≈ 0.337 + 0.000265 ≈ 0.3373 moles. So that's correct.\n\nThen, moles of N₂ is (3/2)*0.3373 ≈ 0.50595 mol. Correct.\n\nThen, molar mass of N₂ is 28.02 g/mol. So 0.50595 * 28.02. Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me write 0.50595 * 28.02.\n\nFirst, break it down:\n\n0.5 * 28.02 = 14.01\n\n0.00595 * 28.02 = ?\n\nCompute 0.005 * 28.02 = 0.1401\n\n0.00095 * 28.02 ≈ 0.026619\n\nAdding those: 0.1401 + 0.026619 ≈ 0.166719\n\nSo total is 14.01 + 0.1667 ≈ 14.1767 g. So approximately 14.18 g. The answer options are given as D:14.188 grams. Which is very close. The slight difference might be due to rounding during the calculation steps.\n\nLet me check if I used exact molar masses. The problem is, the molar masses I used for nitrogen and hydrogen are approximate. Let me check exact values.\n\nNitrogen's molar mass is actually approximately 14.007 g/mol, and hydrogen is approximately 1.008 g/mol. Let me recalculate the molar mass of N₂H₄ with more precise numbers.\n\nMolar mass of N₂H₄:\n\nNitrogen: 14.007 * 2 = 28.014 g/mol\n\nHydrogen: 1.008 * 4 = 4.032 g/mol\n\nTotal: 28.014 + 4.032 = 32.046 g/mol.\n\nSo earlier I used 32.052, but actually it's 32.046. Let me recalculate the moles of N₂H₄ with this value.\n\nmoles = 10.81 g / 32.046 g/mol ≈ ?\n\nAgain, let me approximate. Let me use the previous method.\n\nLet me see, 32.046 * 0.337 = ?\n\nAs before, 32.046 * 0.3 = 9.6138\n\n32.046 * 0.03 = 0.96138\n\n32.046 * 0.007 = 0.224322\n\nAdding up: 9.6138 + 0.96138 = 10.57518 + 0.224322 ≈ 10.7995 g. Which is almost 10.81 g. The difference is 10.81 - 10.7995 = 0.0105 g. So how much more?\n\nSo, 0.0105 g divided by 32.046 g/mol ≈ 0.0003278 mol. Therefore, total moles ≈ 0.337 + 0.0003278 ≈ 0.3373278 mol ≈ 0.3373 mol. So actually, even with the more precise molar mass, it's about the same. So the moles of N₂H₄ is still approximately 0.3373 mol.\n\nTherefore, moles of N₂ is 3/2 * 0.3373 ≈ 0.50595 mol.\n\nNow, molar mass of N₂: 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol.\n\nSo mass of N₂ is 0.50595 mol * 28.014 g/mol.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, 0.5 * 28.014 = 14.007 g\n\nThen, 0.00595 * 28.014 ≈ ?\n\nCompute 0.005 * 28.014 = 0.14007 g\n\n0.00095 * 28.014 ≈ 0.0266133 g\n\nTotal ≈ 0.14007 + 0.0266133 ≈ 0.16668 g\n\nAdding to the 14.007 g gives 14.007 + 0.16668 ≈ 14.1737 g. So approximately 14.174 g. Which is still about 14.17 g. The answer option D is 14.188 grams. Hmm, so there's a small discrepancy. Let me check if there's an error in my calculation steps.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometric ratio? Let me check the balanced equation again.\n\nThe reaction is 2N₂H₄ + N₂O₄ → 3N₂ + 4H₂O. Yes, so 2 moles of N₂H₄ produces 3 moles of N₂. So the ratio is 2:3. So moles of N₂ is (3/2) * moles of N₂H₄. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the molar masses? Let me check again.\n\nNitrogen (N) is approximately 14.01 g/mol. So for N₂H₄:\n\n2*(14.01) + 4*(1.008) = 28.02 + 4.032 = 32.052 g/mol. But if we use more precise atomic masses, like from the periodic table, let me check exact values.\n\nThe exact molar mass of N₂H₄ (hydrazine):\n\nNitrogen: 14.007 g/mol (exactly, depending on the source, sometimes it's 14.0067, but 14.007 is standard)\n\nHydrogen: 1.008 g/mol.\n\nSo 2*14.007 = 28.014 g/mol\n\n4*1.008 = 4.032 g/mol\n\nTotal: 28.014 + 4.032 = 32.046 g/mol. So earlier, I had 32.046 g/mol. So when I calculated moles of N₂H₄ as 10.81 / 32.046 ≈ 0.3373 mol. Correct.\n\nThen moles of N₂ is 3/2 * 0.3373 ≈ 0.50595 mol. Correct.\n\nMolar mass of N₂ is 2*14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. So 0.50595 * 28.014 = ?\n\nLet me compute this more accurately. Let's use decimal multiplication.\n\nLet me write 0.50595 * 28.014.\n\nFirst, multiply 0.50595 * 28.014.\n\nLet me break this down:\n\nFirst, 0.5 * 28.014 = 14.007\n\nThen, 0.00595 * 28.014. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute 0.005 * 28.014 = 0.14007\n\n0.00095 * 28.014 = ?\n\nWell, 0.00095 is 9.5 x 10^-4.\n\n28.014 * 9.5 x 10^-4.\n\nFirst, 28.014 * 0.001 = 0.028014\n\nMultiply by 9.5: 0.028014 * 9.5 ≈ 0.028014 * 10 - 0.028014 * 0.5 = 0.28014 - 0.014007 = 0.266133\n\nWait, no. Wait, 0.028014 * 9.5 is:\n\n= 0.028014 * (9 + 0.5) = 0.028014*9 + 0.028014*0.5\n\n0.028014*9 = 0.252126\n\n0.028014*0.5 = 0.014007\n\nAdding them: 0.252126 + 0.014007 = 0.266133\n\nWait, but this is for 0.00095 * 28.014? No, no. Wait, no. Wait, the 0.00095 is 9.5 x 10^-4, so multiplying by 28.014 gives 0.0266133. Wait, earlier I thought 0.00095 * 28.014 = 0.0266133? But in the previous breakdown, I had 0.005 * 28.014 = 0.14007 and 0.00095 * 28.014 ≈ 0.0266133. Adding those gives 0.14007 + 0.0266133 ≈ 0.1666833.\n\nSo total mass is 14.007 + 0.1666833 ≈ 14.17368 g. So approximately 14.174 grams. \n\nBut the answer options are A:21.282, B:7.094, C:28.376, D:14.188. So D is 14.188 grams. My calculation gives 14.174 grams. There's a small difference here. Why?\n\nPossibly due to rounding during steps. Let me try to carry out the calculation with more precise numbers, perhaps using exact decimal values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use exact molar masses and not approximate them. Let me check exact molar masses.\n\nThe exact molar mass of N₂H₄:\n\nNitrogen: 14.007 g/mol (IUPAC value)\n\nHydrogen: 1.008 g/mol.\n\nSo N₂H₄: 2(14.007) + 4(1.008) = 28.014 + 4.032 = 32.046 g/mol.\n\nSo moles of N₂H₄: 10.81 g / 32.046 g/mol.\n\nLet me calculate this division more accurately. Let me use a calculator-like approach.\n\nLet me write 10.81 divided by 32.046.\n\nLet me set up the division:\n\nDividend: 10.81\n\nDivisor: 32.046\n\nWe can write this as 10.81 / 32.046 ≈ ?\n\nLet me convert both to the same units by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals:\n\n10810 / 32046 ≈ ?\n\nNow perform division:\n\n32046 goes into 10810 how many times? 0 times. Add decimal places.\n\nLet me consider 10810.000...\n\nFirst step: 32046 x 0.3 = 9613.8\n\nSubtract from 10810.0: 10810.0 - 9613.8 = 1196.2\n\nBring down a zero: 11962.0\n\n32046 x 0.03 = 961.38\n\nSubtract from 11962.0: 11962.0 - 961.38 = 11000.62\n\nBring down a zero: 110006.2\n\n32046 x 0.003 = 96.138\n\nWait, maybe I need a better approach. Alternatively, since I know that 0.3 gives 9613.8, and 0.33 gives 0.3*32046 + 0.03*32046 = 9613.8 + 961.38 = 10575.18\n\nSo 0.33 gives 10575.18, which is less than 10810.0. The difference is 10810.0 - 10575.18 = 234.82\n\nNow, how much more do we need? Let me see, how many times does 32046 go into 234.82? Approximately 234.82 / 32046 ≈ 0.0073. So total is 0.33 + 0.0073 ≈ 0.3373. So the value is approximately 0.3373. So moles of N₂H₄ is approximately 0.3373 mol. \n\nSo moles of N₂ is (3/2)*0.3373 = 0.50595 mol. \n\nNow, molar mass of N₂ is 28.014 g/mol. So mass is 0.50595 * 28.014.\n\nLet me calculate this multiplication more accurately. Let me use the exact decimal multiplication.\n\nLet me write 0.50595 * 28.014.\n\nFirst, multiply 0.50595 by 28.014.\n\nLet me use the formula:\n\n(0.5 + 0.005 + 0.00095) * 28.014\n\n= 0.5*28.014 + 0.005*28.014 + 0.00095*28.014\n\n= 14.007 + 0.14007 + 0.0266133\n\n= 14.007 + 0.14007 = 14.14707 + 0.0266133 ≈ 14.173683 g.\n\nSo approximately 14.1737 grams. The answer option D is 14.188 grams. There's a difference of about 0.014 grams. This could be due to rounding during the calculation steps or perhaps using slightly different molar masses.\n\nLet me check if the problem expects us to use different molar masses. For example, sometimes in textbooks, they use rounded molar masses like N=14.01, H=1.01, O=16.00. Let me recalculate using these values.\n\nMolar mass of N₂H₄ with N=14.01 and H=1.01:\n\n2*14.01 + 4*1.01 = 28.02 + 4.04 = 32.06 g/mol.\n\nSo moles of N₂H₄ = 10.81 / 32.06 ≈ ?\n\nLet me calculate 10.81 / 32.06. Let me approximate:\n\n32.06 * 0.337 = ?\n\nAs before, 0.3*32.06=9.618, 0.03*32.06=0.9618, 0.007*32.06=0.22442. Total ≈ 9.618 + 0.9618 = 10.5798 + 0.22442 ≈ 10.8042 g. So 0.337 mol gives 10.8042 g. The actual mass is 10.81 g. The difference is 10.81 - 10.8042 = 0.0058 g. So moles ≈ 0.337 + 0.0058 / 32.06 ≈ 0.337 + 0.00018 ≈ 0.33718 mol. So still approximately 0.3372 mol.\n\nMoles of N₂ is 3/2 * 0.3372 ≈ 0.5058 mol.\n\nMolar mass of N₂ with N=14.01 is 28.02 g/mol.\n\nMass of N₂ = 0.5058 * 28.02 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n0.5 * 28.02 = 14.01\n\n0.0058 * 28.02 ≈ 0.1625\n\nTotal ≈ 14.01 + 0.1625 ≈ 14.1725 g. Still about 14.17 g. Still close to 14.17, not 14.188.\n\nWait, answer D is 14.188 grams. Let me check if perhaps I made an error in the stoichiometric ratio. Let me check the balanced equation again.\n\nOriginal reaction: 2N₂H₄ + N₂O₄ → 3N₂ + 4H₂O. Yes, that's correct. 2 moles of hydrazine and 1 mole of dinitrogen tetroxide gives 3 moles of nitrogen gas and 4 moles of water. So the stoichiometry is correct.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is asking for the mass of nitrogen (N), not nitrogen gas (N₂)? But the question says \"mass of nitrogen is produced\" and the product is N₂(g). The options are in grams, so likely it's N₂. But just to check, if it were asking for N atoms, then we would have to adjust. Let me see.\n\nIf it were nitrogen atoms, then each mole of N₂ is 2 moles of N. But the answer options are in grams. Let me check. If it were N atoms, then mass would be same as N₂? No. For example, if we have 0.50595 moles of N₂, that is 1.0119 moles of N atoms. The molar mass of N atoms is 14.01 g/mol. So mass would be 1.0119 * 14.01 ≈ 14.17 g, same as before. So no difference. So the answer is still about 14.17 g.\n\nBut the answer option D is 14.188 grams. Let me check if there is a miscalculation in the initial step.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the entire thing using precise calculator-like steps, maybe using exact decimal values.\n\nLet me use exact values:\n\nMass of N₂H₄ = 10.81 g\n\nMolar mass of N₂H₄ = 2*14.01 + 4*1.008 = 28.02 + 4.032 = 32.052 g/mol.\n\nMolar mass of N₂ = 28.02 g/mol.\n\nMoles of N₂H₄ = 10.81 / 32.052 = ?\n\nLet me compute this division precisely. Let me use a calculator method.\n\nLet me consider 10.81 ÷ 32.052.\n\nLet me write this as 10.81 ÷ 32.052 ≈ ?\n\nLet me convert this to a decimal by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 10810 ÷ 32052 ≈ ?\n\nNow, let's perform the division step by step.\n\nFirst, 32052 goes into 108100 (adding a decimal and a zero) how many times?\n\nLet me estimate:\n\n32052 x 3 = 96156\n\nSubtract from 108100: 108100 - 96156 = 11944\n\nBring down a zero: 119440\n\n32052 x 3 = 96156\n\nSubtract: 119440 - 96156 = 23284\n\nBring down a zero: 232840\n\n32052 x 7 = 224,364\n\nSubtract: 232,840 - 224,364 = 8,476\n\nBring down a zero: 84,760\n\n32052 x 0.26 ≈ 8333.52, but let me see how many times 32052 goes into 84,760.\n\n32052 x 2 = 64,104\n\nSubtract: 84,760 - 64,104 = 20,656\n\nBring down a zero: 206,560\n\n32052 x 6 = 192,312\n\nSubtract: 206,560 - 192,312 = 14,248\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nWe had 3 (from 32052 x 3 = 96156), then another 3, then 7, then 2, then 6...\n\nSo the decimal starts as 0.3372...\n\nSo approximately 0.3372...\n\nSo moles of N₂H₄ ≈ 0.3372 mol.\n\nMoles of N₂ = (3/2)*0.3372 ≈ 0.5058 mol.\n\nMass of N₂ = 0.5058 mol * 28.02 g/mol = ?\n\nLet me compute 0.5058 * 28.02.\n\nFirst, multiply 0.5 * 28.02 = 14.01\n\nThen 0.0058 * 28.02 = ?\n\n0.005 * 28.02 = 0.1401\n\n0.0008 * 28.02 = 0.022416\n\nTotal = 0.1401 + 0.022416 = 0.162516\n\nAdding to 14.01 gives 14.01 + 0.162516 ≈ 14.1725 g.\n\nSo ≈ 14.17 g. Still close to 14.17. The answer option is D:14.188 grams. The difference is about 0.016 grams. This is within rounding errors depending on the exact molar masses used.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects us to use whole number molar masses. For example, sometimes in problems, they use N=14.0 g/mol, H=1.0 g/mol, O=16.0 g/mol for simplicity.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nMolar mass of N₂H₄ with N=14.0, H=1.0:\n\n2*14.0 + 4*1.0 = 28.0 + 4.0 = 32.0 g/mol.\n\nMoles of N₂H₄ = 10.81 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.3378125 mol.\n\nMoles of N₂ = 3/2 * 0.3378125 ≈ 0.50671875 mol.\n\nMolar mass of N₂ = 2*14.0 = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nMass of N₂ = 0.50671875 * 28.0 = ?\n\n0.5 * 28.0 = 14.0\n\n0.00671875 * 28.0 ≈ 0.188125\n\nTotal ≈ 14.0 + 0.188125 = 14.188125 g. \n\nAh! That gives exactly 14.188 grams, which is option D. So if the problem is using rounded molar masses (N=14.0, H=1.0), then the answer is D. \n\nTherefore, likely the problem expects us to use simplified molar masses for calculation, rounding to one decimal place. In many textbook problems, especially when given options with three decimal places, they use rounded molar masses. Hence, the correct answer is D:14.188 grams.\n\nMy earlier calculations using more precise molar masses gave approximately 14.17 grams, but with the rounded molar masses, it gives 14.188 grams. Therefore, considering that the problem might be using rounded atomic masses, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
