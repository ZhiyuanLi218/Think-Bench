The question is asking for the mass of one molecule of cholesterol, which has the chemical formula C27H46O, and the molecular mass is given as 386. The options are A through D with different values in grams. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that the molecular mass given is in grams per mole, right? So 386 g/mol. To find the mass of a single molecule, I think I need to use Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is 6.022 × 10^23 molecules per mole. So if I take the molar mass and divide it by Avogadro's number, that should give me the mass of one molecule.\n\nLet me write that down. The mass of one molecule would be (molecular mass) divided by Avogadro's number. So that's 386 g/mol divided by 6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol. The units would cancel out the moles, leaving grams per molecule. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let me do 386 divided by 6.022 × 10^23. Let me approximate 6.022 as 6.02 for simplicity. So 386 / 6.02. Let me compute that. 386 divided by 6.02. Let me see, 6 times 64 is 384, so 6.02 times 64 would be a bit more than 384. So 386 divided by 6.02 is approximately 64.1? Let me check with a calculator. 6.02 times 64 is 385.28, and 6.02 times 64.1 would be 6.02*64 + 6.02*0.1 = 385.28 + 0.602 = 385.882. So 386 divided by 6.02 is approximately 64.1. So the value is approximately 64.1 × 10^-23 grams. Because when you divide by 10^23, it's 64.1 × 10^-23 g. Let me express that in proper scientific notation. 64.1 × 10^-23 is the same as 6.41 × 10^-22 grams. So that would be 6.41 × 10^-22 grams, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Because 64.1 × 10^-23 grams is equal to 6.41 × 10^-22 grams. Yes, because moving the decimal one place to the left increases the exponent by one. So 6.41 × 10^-22 is correct. Let me check the options again. Option A is 6.41 × 10^-22 g. So that would be the answer. But let me confirm my calculation again with more precise numbers.\n\nThe exact Avogadro's number is 6.02214076 × 10^23. Let me use a more accurate calculation. 386 divided by 6.02214076. Let me compute that. Let's see, 386 / 6.02214076. Let me approximate this division. Let me use a calculator-like approach.\n\nFirst, 6.02214076 × 64 = ?\n\nWell, 6 × 64 = 384, 0.02214076 × 64 ≈ 1.417 grams. So total is approximately 384 + 1.417 ≈ 385.417 grams. But the numerator is 386 grams, so 386 - 385.417 ≈ 0.583 grams remaining. So 0.583 / 6.02214076 ≈ 0.0968. So total is approximately 64.0968. So 64.0968 × 10^-23 grams. Which is 6.40968 × 10^-22 grams. So approximately 6.41 × 10^-22 grams. That's option A.\n\nBut let me check if the molecular mass is given as 386. The problem says molecular mass = 386. So assuming that's correct, but maybe I should verify the molecular mass of cholesterol to be sure. Wait, cholesterol is C27H46O. Let me check the molecular mass. Carbon is 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol.\n\nCalculating the molecular mass:\n\n27 C atoms: 27 × 12.01 = Let's calculate that. 27 × 12 = 324, 27 × 0.01 = 0.27, so total 324.27 g/mol.\n\n46 H atoms: 46 × 1.008 = 46 × 1 + 46 × 0.008 = 46 + 0.368 = 46.368 g/mol.\n\n1 O atom: 16.00 g/mol.\n\nAdding them up: 324.27 + 46.368 = 370.638 + 16.00 = 386.638 g/mol. So approximately 386.64 g/mol. The problem states molecular mass is 386, which is close enough. So the given value is correct for the problem's purposes. So the calculation is okay.\n\nTherefore, the mass of one molecule is 386 g/mol divided by 6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol, which is approximately 6.41 × 10^-22 grams. So the correct answer should be option A.\n\nBut let me check the other options just to be sure. Let's see:\n\nOption B is 1.5 × 10^-21 g. That's 1.5 × 10^-21, which is ten times larger than 1.5 × 10^-22. But our calculation was 6.41 × 10^-22, which is about 6.4 times 10^-22, so much smaller than 1.5 × 10^-21. So B is too big.\n\nOption C: 1.38 × 10^-21 g. Also too big. Option D: 3 × 10^-23 g. That's 0.3 × 10^-22, which is much smaller than our calculated value. So the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the exponent? Let me check the calculation again. If the molar mass is 386 g/mol, then one mole is 386 grams. One mole contains Avogadro's number of molecules. So one molecule is 386 / 6.022e23 grams. Let me compute that with exact numbers.\n\nLet me compute 386 / 6.022e23. Let me write that as 386 / (6.022 × 10^23). Let me compute 386 / 6.022 first, then multiply by 1e-23.\n\n386 divided by 6.022. Let me use a calculator step-by-step. 6.022 × 60 = 361.32. 386 - 361.32 = 24.68. So 60 + (24.68 / 6.022). Let's compute 24.68 / 6.022 ≈ 4.1. So total is approximately 64.1. Therefore, 64.1 × 1e-23 grams = 6.41 × 10^-22 grams. Yes, that's correct. So the exponent is -22, not -23. So option A is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n</think>"}
