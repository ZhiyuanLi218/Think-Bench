The question is asking for positive integers $ m $ and $ n $ with $ m < n $ such that the sum from $ a_m $ to $ a_{n-1} $ equals $ \\frac{1}{29} $. Then I need to find $ m + n $.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the sequence looks like. Each term is $ \\frac{1}{k^2 + k} $. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this expression. Let me factor the denominator:\n\n$ k^2 + k = k(k + 1) $.\n\nSo, $ a_k = \\frac{1}{k(k + 1)} $. Oh! This looks familiar. I remember that fractions like this can be expressed as telescoping series using partial fractions. Let me try to decompose it.\n\nLet me write $ \\frac{1}{k(k + 1)} $ as $ \\frac{A}{k} + \\frac{B}{k + 1} $. Solving for A and B:\n\n$ 1 = A(k + 1) + Bk $.\n\nLet me plug in some values for k to find A and B. If I set $ k = -1 $, then the equation becomes $ 1 = A(0) + B(-1) $, so $ -B = 1 $, hence $ B = -1 $. If I set $ k = 0 $, then the equation becomes $ 1 = A(1) + B(0) $, so $ A = 1 $. Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\n$ \\frac{1}{k(k + 1)} = \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k + 1} $.\n\nGreat! So each term in the sequence can be written as the difference of reciprocals. This is useful because when we sum consecutive terms, a lot of things might cancel out. Let me write out the sum $ a_m + a_{m+1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} $ using this decomposition.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n$ \\sum_{k = m}^{n - 1} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k + 1} \\right) $.\n\nLet me write out the terms:\n\nFor $ k = m $: $ \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{m + 1} $\n\nFor $ k = m + 1 $: $ \\frac{1}{m + 1} - \\frac{1}{m + 2} $\n\n...\n\nFor $ k = n - 1 $: $ \\frac{1}{n - 1} - \\frac{1}{n} $\n\nNow, adding all these up:\n\nThe $ -\\frac{1}{m + 1} $ from the first term cancels with the $ +\\frac{1}{m + 1} $ from the second term. Similarly, each subsequent negative term cancels with the positive term of the next one. This is the telescoping effect. In the end, all that remains is the first term of the first expression and the last term of the last expression. Therefore, the total sum is:\n\n$ \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} $.\n\nSo, according to the problem, this sum equals $ \\frac{1}{29} $. Therefore, we have:\n\n$ \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29} $.\n\nSo, now we need to solve for positive integers $ m $ and $ n $ with $ m < n $ such that this equation holds. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\n$ \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29} $\n\nLet me combine the left-hand side fractions:\n\n$ \\frac{n - m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{29} $\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n$ 29(n - m) = mn $\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n$ mn + 29m - 29n = 0 $\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this equation. Let me try adding 29² to both sides to complete the rectangle or something like that. Let me recall the technique for Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT). Let me see:\n\nStarting from:\n\n$ mn - 29n + 29m = 0 $\n\nWait, actually, from above, we had:\n\nOriginal cross-multiplied equation: 29(n - m) = mn\n\nWhich rearranged is mn + 29m - 29n = 0.\n\nLet me add 29² to both sides:\n\nmn + 29m - 29n + 29² = 29²\n\nNow, let me factor the left-hand side. Let me group terms:\n\nmn + 29m - 29n + 29² = m(n + 29) - 29(n - 29). Wait, maybe not. Let me try factoring.\n\nAlternatively, think of mn + 29m - 29n = 0. Let me add 29² to both sides:\n\nmn + 29m - 29n + 29² = 29²\n\nNow, factor:\n\nLooking at mn + 29m - 29n + 29², perhaps factor m from first two terms and -29 from the next two:\n\nm(n + 29) -29(n - 29). Wait, n - 29? Let me check:\n\nWait, mn + 29m -29n + 29² = m(n + 29) -29(n - 29). Let me check:\n\nm(n + 29) is mn + 29m. Then, -29(n - 29) is -29n + 29². Yes! Perfect. Therefore:\n\nLeft-hand side is m(n + 29) - 29(n - 29) = m(n + 29) - 29(n - 29). Wait, but actually, that's m(n + 29) - 29(n - 29). Wait, but that's not a straightforward factoring. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as:\n\nmn + 29m - 29n + 29² = (m - 29)(n + 29)? Let me check:\n\nMultiply out (m - 29)(n + 29) = mn + 29m -29n - 29². Hmm, but our left-hand side is mn + 29m -29n + 29². So it's similar, except the last term is +29² instead of -29². Therefore, if I have:\n\nmn + 29m -29n + 29² = (m - 29)(n + 29) + 2*29²? Not sure. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me rearrange the equation:\n\nFrom mn + 29m - 29n = 0, we can write mn + 29m - 29n = 0. Let me add 29² to both sides:\n\nmn + 29m - 29n + 29² = 29².\n\nNow, factor the left-hand side as (m - 29)(n + 29). Wait, let me check:\n\nLet me suppose that (m + a)(n + b) equals mn + 29m -29n + ... Let me try to find a and b such that:\n\n(m + a)(n + b) = mn + b m + a n + a b. Comparing to mn +29m -29n + 29².\n\nSo, we need:\n\nb = 29,\n\na = -29,\n\nand then a b = (-29)(29) = -29². However, in our left-hand side we have +29². Therefore, if we have:\n\n(m - 29)(n + 29) = mn +29m -29n - 29².\n\nBut our left-hand side is mn +29m -29n + 29². Therefore, if we take:\n\n(m - 29)(n + 29) + 2*29² = 29², but this seems messy.\n\nWait, maybe I need to do:\n\nmn +29m -29n = 0 => mn +29m -29n = 0 => mn +29m -29n + something = something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rearrange the equation:\n\nmn + 29m -29n = 0 => mn = 29n -29m => mn = 29(n - m). Let me write this as:\n\nmn = 29(n - m). Let me divide both sides by n - m (assuming n ≠ m, which it isn't since m < n):\n\nm = 29 * [ (n - m) / (n - m) ) ]? Wait no:\n\nWait, mn = 29(n - m). Let me solve for m or n. Let me try solving for n.\n\nmn + 29m = 29n => m(n + 29) = 29n => m = (29n)/(n + 29).\n\nSince m must be a positive integer, (29n)/(n + 29) must be integer. Let me denote this as m = 29n / (n + 29). Therefore, n + 29 must divide 29n. Let me write:\n\nLet me denote d = n + 29. Then n = d - 29. Therefore, substituting back:\n\nm = 29*(d - 29)/d = 29*(1 - 29/d) = 29 - (29²)/d.\n\nSince m must be a positive integer, (29²)/d must be integer. Therefore, d divides 29². Also, since n = d - 29 must be positive, d - 29 > 0 => d > 29. Also, since m must be positive, 29 - (29²)/d > 0 => (29²)/d < 29 => d > 29. Which is already satisfied. Therefore, the divisors d of 29² that are greater than 29.\n\nFirst, note that 29 is a prime number. Therefore, 29² has divisors 1, 29, 29². But since d must be greater than 29, the possible divisors are 29² and... Wait, 29² is 841. Wait, 29 squared is 841. So divisors of 841 greater than 29 are 29² = 841 and... Well, since 29 is prime, the divisors are 1, 29, 841. So only d = 841 is greater than 29. Wait, but maybe there are more? Wait, 29 squared is 841. Since 29 is prime, there are no other divisors. Therefore, the only possible d is 841. Therefore:\n\nd = 841, so n = d - 29 = 841 - 29 = 812. Then m = 29 - (29²)/d = 29 - 841/841 = 29 - 1 = 28.\n\nTherefore, m = 28, n = 812. Let me check if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nCheck if m = 28 and n = 812 satisfy $ \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29} $.\n\nCompute $ \\frac{1}{28} - \\frac{1}{812} $. Let me compute this:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. 812 divided by 28: 28*29 = 812. So 812 is 28*29. Therefore:\n\n$ \\frac{1}{28} - \\frac{1}{28*29} = \\frac{29}{28*29} - \\frac{1}{28*29} = \\frac{28}{28*29} = \\frac{1}{29} $. Perfect! It checks out.\n\nBut wait, are there other possible divisors? Earlier I thought that the only divisors of 29² greater than 29 are 841. But 29² is 841. But maybe there are other divisors if we consider negative divisors? But since d = n + 29, and n is positive, d must be greater than 29, so only positive divisors. Hence, only d = 841. Therefore, the only solution is m = 28, n = 812, so m + n = 28 + 812 = 840.\n\nBut wait, before I conclude, let me check if there are other divisors. For example, if I made a mistake in considering the divisors. Since 29 is prime, 29² factors are 1, 29, 29². Therefore, yes, only three divisors. So only d = 841 is greater than 29. Hence, only one solution. Therefore, m = 28, n = 812, so m + n is 840.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there are other ways to factor the equation? Let me check my steps again.\n\nWe had:\n\nStarting from $ \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29} $, leading to $ \\frac{n - m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{29} $, so $ 29(n - m) = mn $. Then rearranged to $ mn + 29m - 29n = 0 $. Then I added 29² to both sides and tried to factor, but maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, solving for n in terms of m:\n\nFrom $ mn + 29m - 29n = 0 $, rearrange:\n\n$ mn - 29n = -29m $\n\n$ n(m - 29) = -29m $\n\nTherefore:\n\n$ n = \\frac{-29m}{m - 29} $\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -1:\n\n$ n = \\frac{29m}{29 - m} $\n\nSince n must be a positive integer, denominator 29 - m must divide 29m, and 29 - m must be positive. Therefore, 29 - m > 0 => m < 29. Also, since m is a positive integer, m can be from 1 to 28.\n\nTherefore, m is in 1 ≤ m ≤ 28, and 29 - m divides 29m.\n\nSo let me denote d = 29 - m, where d is from 1 to 28 (since m is from 1 to 28). Then m = 29 - d. Therefore:\n\nn = [29*(29 - d)] / d = [29*(29 - d)] / d.\n\nTherefore, n must be integer. Therefore, d divides 29*(29 - d).\n\nBut since d divides 29*(29 - d), let me write:\n\nLet me note that d divides 29*(29 - d). Let me rearrange:\n\nSince d divides 29*(29 - d), and d divides 29*(29 - d) + 29*d = 29*(29 - d + d) = 29^2. Therefore, d divides 29². Therefore, since d divides 29² and d is between 1 and 28, inclusive, then possible values of d are the divisors of 29² that are less than or equal to 28.\n\nSince 29 is prime, divisors of 29² are 1, 29, 841. Therefore, the only divisors of 29² less than or equal to 28 are 1. Because 29 is 29 which is not less than or equal to 28, and 841 is way bigger. Therefore, only d = 1.\n\nWait, so d = 1. Therefore:\n\nd = 1, so m = 29 - 1 = 28, and n = [29*(29 - 1)] / 1 = 29*28 = 812. Which is the same solution as before. Therefore, only one solution. Therefore, m = 28, n = 812, so m + n = 28 + 812 = 840. Therefore, the answer is 840.\n\nBut let me check again. Wait, earlier I considered d as divisors of 29² greater than 29, and here I considered d as divisors less than 29. Both approaches lead to the same solution. So seems like unique solution.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Suppose someone didn't think of partial fractions. But given the problem is about summing terms of 1/(k² +k), partial fractions is the way to go. And telescoping gives us 1/m - 1/n = 1/29. So solving that gives unique solution. So m + n is 840.\n\nBut let me just check with actual sum. Let me check if the sum from k = 28 to n - 1 of a_k equals 1/29. Since n is 812, the sum is from k = 28 to 811. Which telescopes to 1/28 - 1/812. Which we already saw equals 1/29. So correct.\n\nIs there another possible solution? For example, if there is another pair m, n?\n\nBut according to the above reasoning, since the only divisor d of 29² in the required ranges is 1 or 841, leading to same m and n. Therefore, unique solution.\n\nWait, but maybe there are more divisors if we consider that 29 - m divides 29m. Let me think again. Suppose that 29 - m divides 29m. Let me denote d = 29 - m. Then d divides 29m. But m = 29 - d, so d divides 29*(29 - d). Therefore, d divides 29*(29 - d). Let me write this as:\n\nd divides 29*(29 - d). Let me note that since d divides 29*(29 - d), and d divides 29*(29 - d) + 29*d = 29^2, as before. Therefore, d divides 29². Since d is between 1 and 28, only d = 1. Hence, unique solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 28 + 812 = 840. Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach where maybe m and n are smaller numbers. For example, maybe there's another way to get 1/29 as difference of reciprocals. For example, suppose 1/m - 1/n = 1/29. Let me think of other possible integers m and n. For example, if m = 29, then 1/29 - 1/n = 1/29 implies 1/n = 0, which is impossible. If m = 30, then 1/30 - 1/n = 1/29 => -1/n = 1/29 - 1/30 = (30 - 29)/870 = 1/870 => -1/n = 1/870 => n negative, invalid. If m = 27, then 1/27 - 1/n = 1/29 => 1/n = 1/27 - 1/29 = (29 - 27)/783 = 2/783 => n = 783/2 = 391.5, not integer. Similarly m=26: 1/26 - 1/n = 1/29 => 1/n = 1/26 - 1/29 = (29 - 26)/754 = 3/754 => n = 754/3 ≈ 251.333, not integer. Similarly m=25: 1/25 - 1/n = 1/29 => 1/n = 1/25 - 1/29 = (29 - 25)/725 = 4/725 => n = 725/4 = 181.25. Not integer. Similarly m=24: 1/24 - 1/n = 1/29 => 1/n = 1/24 - 1/29 = (29 - 24)/696 = 5/696 => n = 696/5 = 139.2, nope. Continuing this way, seems like only when m=28 we get integer n=812. Therefore, unique solution. Therefore, answer is 28 + 812 = 840.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 840.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{840}\n</think>"}
