Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It's at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. When it undergoes fission, it splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So, the total rest mass of the fragments is 0.99M. That means there's a 1% mass deficit, which should be converted into kinetic energy of the fragments, right?\n\nLet me note down the given information:\n\n- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. Therefore, the rest mass M is such that Mc² = 300 GeV. So, M = 300 GeV/c². But since energy is often expressed in GeV, maybe I can work with energy units directly?\n\nWait, the problem mentions rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. So, the rest mass M is equivalent to 300 GeV/c², but when multiplied by c², it gives 300 GeV. So, the total initial energy is just the rest energy, 300 GeV, since it's at rest. Then, after fission, the total energy of the system should still be 300 GeV, because energy is conserved.\n\nThe two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, with m1 = 2*m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. Let me write that:\n\nm1 = 2*m2\n\nm1 + m2 = 0.99M => 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M => m2 = 0.33M, m1 = 0.66M.\n\nSo, the rest masses of the fragments are 0.66M and 0.33M. The remaining 1% of the initial mass is converted into kinetic energy. So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is (1% of M)*c². Since Mc² is 300 GeV, then the total kinetic energy is 0.01*300 GeV = 3 GeV. So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nNow, since the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, relativistically, the momentum of each fragment is the same in magnitude. However, since their masses are different, their velocities (and hence kinetic energies) will differ.\n\nBut since the kinetic energies are to be calculated both relativistically and classically, and then their difference is to be found, I need to compute T1 (correct) and T1_classical (classical approximation), then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let me compute the correct kinetic energy T1.\n\nIn relativity, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. Also, the total energy must be conserved.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor fragment 1 (more massive):\n\nTotal energy E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = m1 c² + T1\n\nFor fragment 2:\n\nTotal energy E2 = gamma2 * m2 c² = m2 c² + T2\n\nAnd since total energy is conserved:\n\nE1 + E2 = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n\nBut also, from earlier, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. Therefore:\n\nE1 + E2 = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2) = (m1 + m2)c² + 3 GeV = 0.99Mc² + 3 GeV = 0.99*(300 GeV) + 3 GeV = 297 GeV + 3 GeV = 300 GeV. Which checks out. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, to find T1, we need to use the conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal and opposite. Therefore:\n\np1 = -p2 => |p1| = |p2|.\n\nIn relativity, the relation between energy, momentum, and mass is:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\nTherefore, for each fragment:\n\nE1² = (p1 c)² + (m1 c²)²\n\nE2² = (p2 c)² + (m2 c²)²\n\nBut since |p1| = |p2| = p, we can write:\n\nE1² - (m1 c²)² = E2² - (m2 c²)².\n\nAlso, since E1 + E2 = 300 GeV and E1 = m1 c² + T1, E2 = m2 c² + T2, and T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlternatively, since E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, and m1 c² + m2 c² = 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV, so T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment.\n\nSo, for fragment 1:\n\nE1² = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2\n\nSimilarly for fragment 2:\n\nE2² = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2\n\nThen, adding E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.\n\nBut solving these equations for E1 and E2 seems complicated. Maybe we can find p?\n\nAlternatively, since E1 + E2 = 300 GeV and E1 - E2 can be found from the above equations?\n\nWait, if I subtract the two equations:\n\nE1² - E2² = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 - [(p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2] = (m1² - m2²)c^4.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1² - m2²)c^4.\n\nWe know E1 + E2 = 300 GeV. Therefore,\n\n(E1 - E2) = [ (m1² - m2²)c^4 ] / (E1 + E2 )\n\nBut m1 = 2m2, so m1² - m2² = 4m2² - m2² = 3m2².\n\nTherefore,\n\nE1 - E2 = [3m2² c^4 ] / 300 GeV.\n\nBut we also know that E1 = m1 c² + T1 and E2 = m2 c² + T2. Therefore,\n\nE1 - E2 = (m1 c² - m2 c²) + (T1 - T2) = (2m2 - m2)c² + (T1 - T2) = m2 c² + (T1 - T2).\n\nTherefore:\n\nm2 c² + (T1 - T2) = [3m2² c^4 ] / 300 GeV.\n\nThis seems a bit messy. Let me try plugging in numbers. Let me express all masses in terms of M.\n\nEarlier, we found m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M. Wait, actually, m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Since m1 = 2m2, then 3m2 = 0.99M => m2 = 0.33M. Therefore, m1 = 0.66M.\n\nTherefore, m1 c² = 0.66M c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\nSimilarly, m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\nTherefore, m1 c² = 198 GeV, m2 c² = 99 GeV.\n\nSo, E1 = 198 GeV + T1\n\nE2 = 99 GeV + T2\n\nAnd E1 + E2 = 300 GeV => (198 + T1) + (99 + T2) = 297 + T1 + T2 = 300 => T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, as before.\n\nAlso, from earlier:\n\nE1 - E2 = [3m2² c^4 ] / 300 GeV.\n\nBut m2 c² = 99 GeV, so m2² c^4 = (99 GeV)^2.\n\nTherefore:\n\nE1 - E2 = [3*(99 GeV)^2 ] / 300 GeV = [3*(99)^2 / 300] GeV.\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, 3*(99)^2 / 300.\n\nLet me compute 99^2: 99*99 = 9801.\n\nSo 3*9801 / 300 = 29403 / 300 ≈ 98.01 GeV.\n\nTherefore, E1 - E2 ≈ 98.01 GeV.\n\nBut also, E1 - E2 = m2 c² + (T1 - T2) = 99 GeV + (T1 - T2). Therefore:\n\n99 GeV + (T1 - T2) ≈ 98.01 GeV => T1 - T2 ≈ 98.01 - 99 = -0.99 GeV ≈ -1 GeV.\n\nSo T1 - T2 ≈ -1 GeV. But we also know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\nT1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nT1 - T2 = -1 GeV\n\nSolving these equations:\n\nAdding them: 2T1 = 2 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV\n\nThen T2 = 3 - T1 = 2 GeV.\n\nWait, so according to this, T1 is 1 GeV? But that seems very low. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, E1 - E2 came out to be approximately 98.01 GeV? Let me check the calculation again.\n\nEarlier:\n\nE1 - E2 = [3m2² c^4 ] / (E1 + E2) )\n\nBut E1 + E2 is 300 GeV.\n\nBut m2 c² is 99 GeV, so m2² c^4 is (99 GeV)^2.\n\nTherefore, 3*(99 GeV)^2 / 300 GeV = 3*(99^2)/300 GeV.\n\nYes, 99^2 is 9801, so 3*9801 is 29403, divided by 300 is 98.01 GeV. That's correct.\n\nThen, E1 - E2 is 98.01 GeV.\n\nBut E1 - E2 is also equal to m1 c² - m2 c² + T1 - T2? Wait, no:\n\nEarlier I said:\n\nE1 - E2 = (m1 c² - m2 c²) + (T1 - T2). Which is correct because E1 = m1 c² + T1 and E2 = m2 c² + T2.\n\nBut m1 c² is 198 GeV, m2 c² is 99 GeV. Therefore, m1 c² - m2 c² is 99 GeV.\n\nTherefore, 99 GeV + (T1 - T2) = 98.01 GeV => T1 - T2 = -0.99 GeV ≈ -1 GeV.\n\nTherefore, solving T1 + T2 = 3 and T1 - T2 = -1 gives T1 = (3 -1)/2 = 1 GeV? Wait:\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nEquation 1: T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nEquation 2: T1 - T2 = -1 GeV\n\nAdding equations 1 and 2:\n\n2 T1 = 2 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV\n\nThen T2 = 3 - T1 = 2 GeV.\n\nSo according to this, the more massive fragment has a kinetic energy of 1 GeV? But that seems surprisingly low. However, considering that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and the more massive fragment is moving slower (since it's more massive and momentum is same as the lighter one), so it would have less kinetic energy. So the lighter fragment has higher kinetic energy. So T1 is 1 GeV and T2 is 2 GeV. That seems plausible.\n\nBut let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\nWe have for each fragment:\n\nE1² = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2\n\nE2² = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2\n\nAnd E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.\n\nLet me denote p c as something. Let me set variables:\n\nLet me denote pc = x.\n\nThen:\n\nE1² = x² + (198 GeV)^2\n\nE2² = x² + (99 GeV)^2\n\nAnd E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.\n\nLet me denote E1 = 300 - E2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(300 - E2)^2 = x² + (198)^2\n\nand\n\nE2² = x² + (99)^2\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n(300 - E2)^2 - E2² = (x² + 198²) - (x² + 99²)\n\nLeft side: expand (300 - E2)^2 - E2² = 300² - 600 E2 + E2² - E2² = 90000 - 600 E2\n\nRight side: 198² - 99² = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99 * 297 = let's compute that:\n\n99 * 297 = 99*(300 - 3) = 99*300 - 99*3 = 29700 - 297 = 29403 GeV².\n\nTherefore:\n\n90000 - 600 E2 = 29403\n\nSolving for E2:\n\n600 E2 = 90000 - 29403 = 60597\n\nTherefore, E2 = 60597 / 600 ≈ 100.995 GeV.\n\nTherefore, E2 ≈ 101 GeV.\n\nTherefore, E1 = 300 - 101 ≈ 199 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 is E1 - m1 c² = 199 GeV - 198 GeV = 1 GeV. Same as before. And kinetic energy of fragment 2 is E2 - m2 c² = 101 GeV - 99 GeV = 2 GeV. So that checks out. Therefore, T1 is indeed 1 GeV.\n\nNow, the question is about the difference between this correct value (1 GeV) and the value calculated using classical approximation.\n\nSo, let's compute T1_classical.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and momentum p = mv. Since the momenta of the two fragments are equal and opposite, we have:\n\np1 = p2 => m1 v1 = m2 v2.\n\nBut m1 = 2 m2, so 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 => v2 = 2 v1.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the lighter fragment is twice that of the heavier one.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2 (2v1)^2 = m2 v1² + (1/2)m2 *4 v1² = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1².\n\nThis total kinetic energy is given as 3 GeV. Therefore:\n\n3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV => m2 v1² = 1 GeV.\n\nBut we need to find T1_classical, which is (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² = m2 v1² = 1 GeV.\n\nWait, so according to classical mechanics, T1_classical is 1 GeV, same as the relativistic result? But that can't be. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the sum of rest masses is 99% of initial mass. In the classical calculation, do we take into account the mass deficit? Wait, in the problem statement, when calculating the classical approximation, do we assume that all the mass is conserved? Or do we still use the same mass deficit?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\" So even in the classical calculation, the mass is 99% of M, so the missing 1% is converted into kinetic energy? Or is the classical approximation assuming that the total mass is conserved?\n\nThis is a critical point. The problem says to calculate T1 using classical approximation. How is the classical approximation applied here?\n\nIn reality, the mass deficit is converted into energy. But in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so how would you account for the kinetic energy? Maybe in the classical approximation, they ignore relativity, but still use the same mass deficit to compute kinetic energy? Or maybe they assume that the kinetic energy comes from some other source?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\" So even in the classical calculation, we need to use that the total rest mass is 99% of M. Therefore, the missing 1% is converted into kinetic energy. But in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so maybe the problem is assuming that the kinetic energy comes from some potential energy? But since the question is about the difference between the relativistic and classical calculation, perhaps in the classical case, they still use the same total kinetic energy (3 GeV) but distribute it differently?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit. But in classical mechanics, if you have a system where a mass splits into two parts, the kinetic energy would have to come from some internal potential energy. However, the problem is asking for the classical approximation of T1, given that the kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit. But in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so how can the kinetic energy come from the mass deficit?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the problem assumes that in the classical approximation, the total kinetic energy is still 1% of the initial rest energy, i.e., 3 GeV, and we have to distribute it classically. That is, ignore relativity but still use the same total kinetic energy.\n\nIf that is the case, then in classical mechanics, with total kinetic energy 3 GeV, and the same momentum condition, we can compute T1_classical.\n\nEarlier, I found that in classical mechanics, with p1 = p2, and m1 = 2 m2, the kinetic energies would be T1 = 1 GeV and T2 = 2 GeV. Which is the same as the relativistic result. But that can't be, because then the difference would be zero, which is not one of the options. So clearly, I must have made a wrong assumption here.\n\nWait, but in reality, in classical mechanics, the relation between kinetic energy and momentum is different. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and momentum is mv. So if p is the same for both fragments, then T = p²/(2m). Therefore, for the more massive fragment, T1_classical = p²/(2m1), and for the lighter one T2_classical = p²/(2m2). Since m1 = 2 m2, then T1_classical = (p²)/(2*(2m2)) = (p²)/(4m2), and T2_classical = p²/(2m2). Therefore, T2_classical = 2*T1_classical. Therefore, the ratio is 1:2. Also, total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3T1_classical = 3 GeV => T1_classical = 1 GeV. Same as before. So according to classical mechanics, T1 is 1 GeV. But in reality, relativistically, it's also 1 GeV? But that contradicts the problem statement, which says there is a difference. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my reasoning.\n\nWait, no. Earlier, I found that relativistically, T1 is 1 GeV. But in reality, when I calculated the relativistic kinetic energy, it was 1 GeV. However, the problem says that the correct value is T1, and the classical value is different. But according to this, they are the same? That can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation? Let me check again.\n\nEarlier, I found that E1 = 199 GeV, so T1 = E1 - m1 c² = 199 - 198 = 1 GeV. But is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check E2 ≈ 101 GeV. So T2 = E2 - m2 c² = 101 - 99 = 2 GeV. So total kinetic energy is 1 + 2 = 3 GeV. That's correct.\n\nBut in reality, relativistic kinetic energy is not just E - mc²? Yes, that is correct. The total energy is rest energy plus kinetic energy. So yes, T = E - mc². So that's correct.\n\nBut then why is the classical calculation giving the same answer? Because in classical mechanics, with the same momentum condition, the kinetic energies are in inverse proportion to the masses. Which is also true relativistically? No, that's not true. In relativity, kinetic energy is not p²/(2m). So why did we get the same result?\n\nWait, in our case, the relativistic calculation gave T1 = 1 GeV, which is the same as the classical calculation. But according to the problem, there should be a difference. Therefore, my mistake must be in assuming that in the classical calculation, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. But perhaps in reality, in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is calculated differently?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation\".\n\nSo maybe in the classical approximation, they don't take into account the mass deficit? Instead, they assume that the total energy is conserved as kinetic energy, but using classical formulas?\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the classical approximation, they assume that the kinetic energy comes from the rest mass energy, but using classical formulas for energy?\n\nWait, in reality, the kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit, which is (Δm)c². In classical mechanics, if we ignore relativity, how would we calculate the kinetic energy? Maybe they would use the same mass deficit but treat it as kinetic energy classically? But in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so the mass deficit doesn't exist. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking us to assume that the kinetic energy is the same as the mass deficit energy (i.e., 3 GeV), and then compute T1 using classical mechanics, which we did as 1 GeV, and compare to the relativistic calculation which is also 1 GeV? But that would give zero difference. Which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the classical calculation, they do not consider the mass deficit? Instead, they assume that the nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses adding up to M, and then calculate the kinetic energy from some other source. But the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so maybe in the classical case, they also use the same rest masses?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\"\n\nSo, the problem gives us that the rest masses sum to 99% of M. So in both relativistic and classical calculations, the rest masses are 0.66M and 0.33M. The difference is how the kinetic energy is calculated.\n\nBut in relativity, the kinetic energy comes from the missing 1% of the mass. In classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so the kinetic energy must come from another source. However, the problem says to calculate T1 using classical approximation. How?\n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that the classical calculation still uses the same total kinetic energy (3 GeV) but uses classical formulas for distributing it between the fragments. But earlier, we saw that in classical mechanics, with equal and opposite momenta, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses. Which gave T1 = 1 GeV. Which is the same as the relativistic value. But this is not possible, since the answer options are non-zero. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe in the classical calculation, they do not use conservation of momentum? For example, maybe they assume that the kinetic energies are proportional to the masses? Or something else?\n\nWait, no. In classical mechanics, if the system is initially at rest, then the total momentum must still be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Therefore, p1 = -p2. Therefore, the kinetic energies must be T1 = p²/(2m1) and T2 = p²/(2m2). Therefore, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2. Therefore, T1 = (m2/m1) T2. And since T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, we get T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV. Same as before.\n\nBut if that's the case, then why is there a difference between relativistic and classical? There isn't, according to this. But the problem says there is. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, but in reality, the total kinetic energy in relativity is not 3 GeV. Wait, no. Earlier, I calculated that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Because the total rest mass is 99% of M, so the missing 1% is converted into kinetic energy. But in reality, in relativity, the total kinetic energy is (Δm)c² only if the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest energy. But in this case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, while the rest energy is 300 GeV. So 3 GeV is 1% of the rest energy. So it's a small fraction. Therefore, maybe in the classical approximation, they approximate the kinetic energy as (Δm)c², which is 3 GeV, and then distribute it classically as 1 GeV and 2 GeV. But in reality, the relativistic calculation also gives 1 GeV and 2 GeV. But why?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in reality, the total kinetic energy is (Δm)c² only if the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest energy, and we use the approximation that the total energy is approximately the rest energy plus kinetic energy. Which is what we did earlier. However, in reality, the total energy is E1 + E2 = 300 GeV. And since the kinetic energies are small compared to the rest energies, the relativistic calculation should give approximately the same result as the classical one. But in our case, they gave exactly the same result. Why?\n\nBecause in this particular case, with the momentum condition and the mass ratio, the classical and relativistic results coincided? But that seems unlikely. Let me check with actual numbers.\n\nLet me take the relativistic case. The kinetic energy is 1 GeV. Let's compute the classical kinetic energy for the same velocity. Wait, but we don't have velocities. Alternatively, let's compute the Lorentz factor γ for the more massive fragment.\n\nFor the more massive fragment, its total energy E1 is 199 GeV, rest energy is 198 GeV. Therefore, γ1 = E1 / (m1 c²) = 199 / 198 ≈ 1.00505.\n\nSo γ is very close to 1, which means the velocity is non-relativistic. Therefore, the classical approximation should be good, but why is there no difference?\n\nWait, if γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)(v²/c²), then the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)m c² ≈ (1/2)m v², which is the classical result. So in this case, since the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest energy, the relativistic kinetic energy is approximately equal to the classical one. Therefore, the difference should be very small. But according to our previous calculation, they are exactly the same. Why?\n\nBecause in our case, the total kinetic energy was calculated as exactly the mass deficit times c², and then distributed according to the classical momentum conservation. But in reality, the relativistic calculation also gave the same distribution. However, if we do a more precise calculation, there would be a small difference. But in our case, with γ ≈ 1.005, the difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy should be negligible, but maybe the problem is considering some other aspect?\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we found that the relativistic kinetic energy was exactly 1 GeV, same as the classical. But how is that possible? Because we used the exact relativistic equations and got T1 = 1 GeV, which coincides with the classical result. But this seems to suggest that for small kinetic energies, the relativistic and classical results are the same. But that's not true. For example, if you have a particle with kinetic energy T, classically T = (1/2)mv², relativistically T = (γ - 1)mc². For small velocities, they are approximately equal, but not exactly.\n\nWait, in our case, the kinetic energy is 1 GeV, while the rest energy is 198 GeV. So the kinetic energy is about 0.5% of the rest energy. So it's a small fraction, but not extremely small. Let's compute the classical kinetic energy for the same velocity as the relativistic case.\n\nFor the relativistic case, γ ≈ 1.00505. Let's compute the classical kinetic energy.\n\nFirst, find β = v/c.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) ≈ 1.00505.\n\nLet me solve for β:\n\nsqrt(1 - β²) = 1/γ ≈ 1/1.00505 ≈ 0.994987.\n\nSquare both sides: 1 - β² ≈ 0.9900 => β² ≈ 0.01 => β ≈ 0.1.\n\nSo v ≈ 0.1c.\n\nClassical kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² = 0.5 * m * (0.1c)^2 = 0.5 * m c² * 0.01 = 0.005 * m c².\n\nFor the more massive fragment, m c² = 198 GeV. Therefore, classical KE would be 0.005 * 198 GeV = 0.99 GeV ≈ 1 GeV. Which matches the relativistic result of 1 GeV. Therefore, the difference is about 0.01 GeV, which is 10 MeV. Wait, 0.99 GeV vs 1 GeV is a difference of 0.01 GeV = 10 MeV. Ah! There we go!\n\nWait, earlier I thought they were exactly equal, but actually, the classical calculation gives 0.99 GeV and the relativistic gives 1 GeV? Wait, no. Wait, in the relativistic case, we calculated T1 = 1 GeV, and in the classical case, if we compute the kinetic energy for the same velocity, it would be 0.99 GeV. But how did we get 1 GeV in the classical calculation before?\n\nBecause earlier, we assumed that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV and distributed it according to classical momentum conservation, giving T1 = 1 GeV. But if we instead calculate the classical kinetic energy for the actual relativistic velocity, it would be different. But how is that connected?\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me clarify.\n\nThere are two approaches:\n\n1. In the relativistic case, we calculated T1 = 1 GeV.\n\n2. In the classical case, if we assume that the kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit (3 GeV total), and distribute it using classical momentum conservation (which gave T1 = 1 GeV), then the difference is zero. But this is incorrect because in reality, the classical kinetic energy should be calculated using classical formulas for the same physical situation.\n\nBut the physical situation is that the kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit. However, in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so there is no mass deficit. Therefore, the problem might be asking us to assume that the kinetic energy is equal to the mass deficit energy (3 GeV), and then compute T1 using classical mechanics, which we did as 1 GeV, and compare it to the relativistic value of 1 GeV. But that would give no difference. However, if instead, we calculate the classical kinetic energy based on the actual relativistic velocities, there would be a small difference.\n\nBut how to resolve this?\n\nThe problem says: \"the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation\".\n\nSo the correct T1 is 1 GeV. The classical approximation would be to calculate T1_classical using classical formulas for kinetic energy, given the same physical scenario.\n\nBut what is the physical scenario? The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses 0.66M and 0.33M, with total kinetic energy 3 GeV. In classical mechanics, how would you calculate the kinetic energy?\n\nAssuming that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and that the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (because the initial momentum is zero), then the distribution of kinetic energy between the fragments is as we did before: T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV. Therefore, in this case, the classical value would be the same as the relativistic one. But this contradicts the idea that there is a difference. Therefore, perhaps the problem is not assuming that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV in the classical case, but rather that the classical calculation uses the classical relation between mass and energy?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that in the classical calculation, they don't take into account the mass deficit? Let me think.\n\nIn reality, the kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit, which is Δm c² = 0.01Mc² = 3 GeV. In classical mechanics, if we ignore relativity, we might think that the kinetic energy is equal to the potential energy released during fission, which is some value. But the problem doesn't give us any information about potential energy. Therefore, the only way to calculate the classical kinetic energy is by assuming that it is equal to the mass deficit energy, which is 3 GeV. Therefore, distributing it classically gives T1 = 1 GeV, same as relativistic. Therefore, difference is zero. But since the answer options are non-zero, this suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking to calculate the classical kinetic energy based on the conservation of energy and momentum, but using classical formulas for energy and momentum. Let's try that.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the total energy is kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. But since in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, the rest mass energy is the same before and after. Therefore, the kinetic energy comes from some other source. But the problem states that the kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit. Therefore, maybe in the classical calculation, we have to assume that the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and then calculate T1 as 1 GeV. But then difference is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not assuming that the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, but instead that the classical calculation uses the classical relation between mass and velocity, ignoring relativity, and computes the kinetic energy based on the velocities derived from conservation of momentum and energy.\n\nWait, but in classical mechanics, energy and momentum conservation would need to be applied differently. Let me try.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the initial nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta: m1 v1 = m2 v2. As before, with m1 = 2m2, this gives v2 = 2v1.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2(4v1²) = m2 v1² + 2m2 v1² = 3m2 v1².\n\nBut where does this kinetic energy come from? In classical mechanics, it would have to come from some potential energy, say, E_p = 3 GeV. Therefore, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Therefore, 3m2 v1² = 3 GeV => m2 v1² = 1 GeV. Therefore, T1 = (1/2)m1 v1² = m2 v1² = 1 GeV. Same as before.\n\nBut in reality, in relativity, the kinetic energy is also 1 GeV. So why is there a difference?\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed the classical kinetic energy for the same velocity as the relativistic case, I found it to be 0.99 GeV, while the relativistic was 1 GeV. So the difference is 0.01 GeV = 10 MeV. But how does this relate to the problem?\n\nAh! Perhaps the problem is not assuming that the classical calculation uses the same total kinetic energy, but rather that it uses the classical formulas to calculate the kinetic energy based on the relativistic velocities? But that doesn't make sense, since classical and relativistic calculations use different velocities.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is 1 GeV. To find the classical approximation of T1, we need to calculate what T1 would be if we used classical formulas instead of relativistic ones, for the same physical situation. \n\nBut what is the physical situation? It is that the fragments have certain velocities, derived from the relativistic calculation. If we were to calculate their kinetic energy using classical formulas, what would it be?\n\nSo, first, let's find the velocity of the more massive fragment in the relativistic case.\n\nWe had γ1 ≈ 1.00505 for the more massive fragment. As calculated earlier, β ≈ 0.1.\n\nLet me calculate it more precisely.\n\nγ = 199 / 198 ≈ 1.0050505...\n\nWe have γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nSo sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/γ ≈ 0.994987...\n\nSquaring: 1 - β² ≈ (0.994987)^2 ≈ 0.9900\n\nTherefore, β² ≈ 1 - 0.9900 = 0.01 => β ≈ 0.1.\n\nLet me compute more accurately:\n\nLet me take γ = 199/198 ≈ 1.005050505...\n\nThen, 1/γ² = (198/199)^2 ≈ (1 - 1/199)^2 ≈ 1 - 2/199 + (1/199)^2 ≈ 0.9900.\n\nSo, 1 - β² = 1/γ² ≈ 0.9900 => β² ≈ 0.01 => β ≈ 0.1.\n\nTherefore, the velocity is approximately 0.1c.\n\nNow, the classical kinetic energy would be T1_classical = (1/2)m1 v1².\n\nWe know that γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)β² + ... for small β. So γ - 1 ≈ (1/2)β².\n\nIn our case, γ - 1 = (199/198) - 1 = 1/198 ≈ 0.00505.\n\nOn the other hand, (1/2)β² ≈ 0.5 * 0.01 = 0.005. So they are approximately equal. Therefore, the relativistic kinetic energy T1 = (γ - 1)m1 c² ≈ 0.00505 * 198 GeV ≈ 1 GeV, which matches. The classical kinetic energy would be (1/2)m1 v1² = (1/2)m1 (βc)^2 = 0.5 * m1 c² * β² ≈ 0.5 * 198 GeV * 0.01 = 0.99 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 is 1 GeV - 0.99 GeV = 0.01 GeV = 10 MeV.\n\nAh! This must be the correct approach. The problem is asking for the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy (1 GeV) and the classical kinetic energy calculated for the same velocity (0.99 GeV), giving a difference of 10 MeV, which is option B.\n\nBut how do we arrive at this classical kinetic energy? Because in the classical calculation, if we assume that the kinetic energy is distributed as per classical momentum conservation (giving T1 = 1 GeV), but in reality, the classical kinetic energy for the actual velocity is 0.99 GeV. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nLet me think again. The problem says: \"the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation\".\n\nThe correct T1 is 1 GeV. The classical approximation would be to calculate T1 using classical formulas. But what is the classical approximation here? It could mean two things:\n\n1. Assuming that the kinetic energy is distributed classically (with equal momenta) and total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, giving T1 = 1 GeV. In this case, the difference is zero, which is not an option.\n\n2. Calculating the classical kinetic energy based on the actual relativistic velocity. In this case, T1_classical = 0.99 GeV, giving a difference of 10 MeV.\n\nThe second interpretation makes sense because the question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy and the classical approximation of it. So if you were to calculate the kinetic energy using classical formulas (T = 1/2 mv²) instead of relativistic ones (T = (γ - 1)mc²), then you would get a different value.\n\nTherefore, to compute T1_classical, we need to find the velocity of the more massive fragment in the relativistic scenario, and then plug it into the classical kinetic energy formula.\n\nWe already did this: the velocity is approximately 0.1c, leading to T1_classical ≈ 0.99 GeV, difference of 0.01 GeV = 10 MeV, which is option B.\n\nBut let me verify this with precise calculation.\n\nGiven γ = 199/198, let's calculate β more accurately.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\n=> sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/γ = 198/199\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 - β² = (198/199)^2\n\n=> β² = 1 - (198/199)^2\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n(198/199)^2 = (199 - 1)^2 / 199² = (199² - 2*199 + 1)/199² = 1 - 2/199 + 1/199²\n\nTherefore, β² = 1 - [1 - 2/199 + 1/199²] = 2/199 - 1/199² ≈ 2/199 - negligible ≈ 0.01005025...\n\nSo β² ≈ 0.01005025\n\nTherefore, classical kinetic energy is:\n\nT1_classical = (1/2)m1 v1² = 0.5 * m1 c² * β² ≈ 0.5 * 198 GeV * 0.01005025 ≈ 0.5 * 198 * 0.01005025 GeV.\n\nCalculate 0.5 * 198 = 99.\n\nThen 99 * 0.01005025 ≈ 99 * 0.01 + 99 * 0.00005025 ≈ 0.99 + 0.00497475 ≈ 0.99497475 GeV.\n\nTherefore, T1_classical ≈ 0.995 GeV.\n\nThe correct T1 is 1 GeV.\n\nDifference is 1 - 0.995 = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nWait, this is different from the previous 10 MeV. Hmm. What's going on?\n\nWait, earlier I approximated β² ≈ 0.01, giving T1_classical ≈ 0.99 GeV. But with more precise calculation, β² ≈ 0.01005, giving T1_classical ≈ 0.995 GeV. So difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Which is option C.\n\nBut let me do this calculation more accurately.\n\nLet me compute β² exactly:\n\nβ² = 1 - (198/199)^2 = [199² - 198²]/199² = [(199 - 198)(199 + 198)] / 199² = [1 * 397]/199² = 397 / (199^2)\n\nCalculate 199^2: 199*199 = (200 - 1)^2 = 40000 - 400 + 1 = 39601\n\nTherefore, β² = 397 / 39601 ≈ let's divide 397 by 39601.\n\nWell, 39601 / 397 ≈ 99.75, so 1/99.75 ≈ 0.010025. Therefore, β² ≈ 0.010025.\n\nTherefore, T1_classical = 0.5 * 198 GeV * 0.010025 = 99 GeV * 0.010025 ≈ 99 * 0.01 + 99 * 0.000025 = 0.99 + 0.002475 = 0.992475 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 1 GeV - 0.992475 GeV = 0.007525 GeV = 7.525 MeV.\n\nHmm, this is approximately 7.5 MeV, which is not one of the options. The options are A:2, B:10, C:5, D:20.\n\nThis suggests that my approach might still be missing something.\n\nWait, let me go back. How did we get T1 = 1 GeV in the relativistic case?\n\nWe had E1 = 199 GeV, m1 c² = 198 GeV, so T1 = 1 GeV. But let's verify this.\n\nIn reality, the kinetic energy is T = (γ - 1) m c². We have γ = E / (m c²) = 199 / 198, so T = (199/198 - 1) * 198 GeV = (1/198) * 198 GeV = 1 GeV. Correct.\n\nNow, the classical kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But we can also express this in terms of γ. For small velocities, γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)β², so β² ≈ 2(γ - 1). Therefore, (1/2)mv² = (1/2)m β² c² ≈ (γ - 1) m c². Wait, that suggests that classical KE ≈ relativistic KE for small velocities. But in our case, we have γ - 1 = 1/198 ≈ 0.00505, and β² ≈ 2*(γ - 1) = 0.0101, which is what we found. Therefore, classical KE = 0.5 * m * β² c² ≈ 0.5 * m * 2(γ - 1)c² = (γ - 1)m c² = T. Therefore, classical KE ≈ T. But in reality, there is a small difference due to higher-order terms in γ.\n\nWait, let's expand γ to higher order.\n\nγ = 1 + (1/2)β² + (3/8)β⁴ + ...\n\nTherefore, γ - 1 = (1/2)β² + (3/8)β⁴ + ...\n\nSo, classical KE = (1/2)mv² = (1/2)m β² c² = [γ - 1 - (3/8)β⁴ m c² / m c²] * m c² = (γ - 1) m c² - (3/8)β⁴ m c².\n\nTherefore, the difference between relativistic and classical KE is approximately -(3/8)β⁴ m c².\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nβ² ≈ 0.0101, so β⁴ ≈ (0.0101)^2 ≈ 0.000102.\n\nThen, difference ≈ - (3/8) * 0.000102 * m c² ≈ - (0.00003825) * 198 GeV ≈ -0.007575 GeV ≈ -7.575 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the classical KE is less than the relativistic KE by about 7.6 MeV. Therefore, the difference is approximately 7.6 MeV. But this is not one of the options. The closest is option C:5 MeV or B:10 MeV.\n\nBut perhaps my approximations are too rough. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nWe have β² = 397 / 39601 ≈ 0.0100251256.\n\nThen β⁴ ≈ (0.0100251256)^2 ≈ 0.000100503.\n\nThen difference ≈ - (3/8) * 0.000100503 * 198 GeV.\n\nCalculate:\n\n3/8 * 0.000100503 ≈ 0.0000376886.\n\nMultiply by 198 GeV: 0.0000376886 * 198 ≈ 0.007462 GeV ≈ 7.462 MeV.\n\nStill about 7.5 MeV. Hmm.\n\nBut the options are 2, 5, 10, 20 MeV. This suggests that perhaps my entire approach is incorrect, and the intended solution is different.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the problem assumes that in the classical calculation, the kinetic energy is calculated assuming that the total energy released is the mass deficit times c², but using classical kinetic energy formulas without considering relativistic momentum.\n\nWait, but we did that earlier and got T1 = 1 GeV, same as relativistic. But the difference is zero. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that in the classical calculation, the velocities are such that the kinetic energy is the mass deficit, but using classical energy and momentum conservation, leading to a different result.\n\nWait, let's try that. Let's assume that in the classical calculation, we don't know the kinetic energy, but we have to derive it from conservation of energy and momentum, assuming classical physics.\n\nBut in classical physics, the rest mass is conserved, so the rest mass energy is the same before and after. Therefore, where does the kinetic energy come from? It must come from some other source, say, potential energy. But since the problem states that the kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit, maybe we are to assume that the classical calculation uses the mass deficit as the kinetic energy, but with classical formulas.\n\nBut if we do that, then we have total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and we distribute it as T1 = 1 GeV and T2 = 2 GeV, giving a difference of 0. But this is not an option. So this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the classical calculation to assume that the kinetic energy is derived from the mass deficit, but using classical energy-momentum relations, leading to a different result.\n\nWait, in classical mechanics, if you have a mass M at rest, which splits into two masses m1 and m2, with m1 + m2 = M, and some kinetic energy. But in our case, m1 + m2 = 0.99M, so there is a mass deficit of 0.01M. In classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is assuming that in the classical case, the total mass is still M, and the kinetic energy is derived from some other source, and we are to calculate T1 under classical assumptions, but with the same mass ratio (m1 = 2m2, m1 + m2 = M). But this would mean that the mass deficit is zero, and the kinetic energy is from somewhere else. But the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so this is not the case.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given that the options are 2, 5, 10, 20 MeV, and my detailed calculation gave approximately 7.5 MeV, which is not an option, but close to 5 or 10, perhaps there is a simpler way the problem expects us to solve it, possibly with approximations.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's assume that the kinetic energy is small, so we can use the approximation that the total energy is approximately the rest energy plus kinetic energy, and that the momentum is non-relativistic, so p = mv.\n\nIn this case, the total energy of each fragment is approximately E ≈ mc² + T, and the momentum p = mv.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, m1 v1 = m2 v2.\n\nFrom conservation of energy, T1 + T2 = 0.01Mc² = 3 GeV.\n\nClassically, T1 = (1/2)m1 v1², T2 = (1/2)m2 v2².\n\nWith m1 = 2m2, and v2 = 2v1, as before, leading to T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV.\n\nBut relativistically, T1 = 1 GeV, as we found. So where is the difference?\n\nAh! Wait, no. Earlier, we found that the relativistic calculation gave T1 = 1 GeV, but this is under the assumption that the total energy is conserved as E1 + E2 = 300 GeV. However, if we use the classical approximation for the kinetic energy, but still use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, we might get a different result.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think of the problem from the perspective of the options given. The correct T1 is 1 GeV, and the classical approximation is different by one of the options. Given that the difference is approximately 7.5 MeV, which is not an option, but perhaps the question expects us to use a simpler approximation.\n\nLet me try to calculate the classical kinetic energy using the velocities derived from the relativistic momentum.\n\nIn the relativistic case, the momentum p is the same for both fragments.\n\nFor the more massive fragment, p = γ1 m1 v1.\n\nBut since γ1 is close to 1, we can approximate p ≈ m1 v1, which is the classical momentum. But in reality, p = γ1 m1 v1. If we use this relativistic momentum in the classical kinetic energy formula, would that make sense?\n\nNo, that would be mixing relativistic and classical concepts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the classical kinetic energy assuming that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, but using the classical relation between kinetic energy and momentum, leading to a different distribution?\n\nWait, in classical mechanics, T = p²/(2m). If the momentum is the same for both fragments, then T1 = p²/(2m1), T2 = p²/(2m2). With m1 = 2m2, T1 = T2/2. And T1 + T2 = 3 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV. Same as before.\n\nBut if in reality, the momentum is not the same? No, in relativity, the magnitude of the momenta are the same. In classical mechanics, they must be too, due to conservation of momentum.\n\nTherefore, I'm stuck. Given that my detailed calculation suggests a difference of ~7.5 MeV, which is not an option, but the closest is 5 or 10, and considering that in my first rough approximation I had 10 MeV and in a more precise calculation 7.5 MeV, perhaps the intended answer is 10 MeV, option B, and the discrepancy is due to approximation in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to calculate the classical kinetic energy using the exact relativistic momentum.\n\nIn relativity, the momentum p is given by p = γ1 m1 v1.\n\nIn classical mechanics, if we use this p to calculate the classical kinetic energy, we would have T_classical = p²/(2m1). Let's compute this.\n\nFrom the relativistic calculation, we have:\n\nFor the more massive fragment, E1 = γ1 m1 c² = 199 GeV, m1 c² = 198 GeV, so γ1 = 199/198.\n\nAlso, from E1² = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2, we have:\n\n(199)^2 = (p c / 198 GeV)^2 + (198)^2.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\nE1² = (pc)^2 + (m1 c²)^2\n\n=> (199 GeV)^2 = (pc)^2 + (198 GeV)^2\n\n=> (pc)^2 = (199^2 - 198^2) (GeV)^2 = (199 - 198)(199 + 198) (GeV)^2 = (1)(397) (GeV)^2 = 397 (GeV)^2\n\nTherefore, pc = sqrt(397) GeV ≈ 19.9248 GeV.\n\nTherefore, p ≈ 19.9248 GeV/c.\n\nNow, in classical mechanics, T_classical = p²/(2m1).\n\nLet's compute this.\n\np² = (397 GeV²)\n\nm1 c² = 198 GeV => m1 = 198 GeV/c².\n\nTherefore, T_classical = (397 GeV²) / (2 * 198 GeV/c²) * 1/c² ? Wait, no. Wait, units:\n\nT_classical = p²/(2m1) = ( (pc)^2 ) / (2m1 c²) ) * c² / c² ? Let me check units.\n\nActually, let's compute it properly.\n\np = 19.9248 GeV/c\n\nT_classical = p²/(2m1) = ( (19.9248 GeV/c)^2 ) / (2 * 198 GeV/c²) ) = ( (397 GeV²/c²) ) / (396 GeV/c²) ) = 397/396 GeV ≈ 1.002525 GeV.\n\nTherefore, T_classical ≈ 1.0025 GeV.\n\nThe correct T1 is 1 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 1.0025 - 1 = 0.0025 GeV = 2.5 MeV, which is close to option A:2 MeV.\n\nWait, this is a different result! What's happening here?\n\nAh, this is a crucial point. If we take the relativistic momentum p and plug it into the classical kinetic energy formula T = p²/(2m), we get a value slightly higher than the relativistic kinetic energy. In this case, the classical approximation gives T_classical ≈ 1.0025 GeV, while the correct value is 1 GeV. The difference is 0.0025 GeV = 2.5 MeV, which is close to option A:2 MeV.\n\nBut why is this different from the previous calculation?\n\nBecause previously, I was calculating the classical kinetic energy based on the relativistic velocity, but here, I'm calculating it based on the relativistic momentum. These are two different approaches, and they give different results.\n\nWhich one is the correct classical approximation?\n\nThe question is asking for the classical approximation of T1, given the relativistic scenario. If the classical approximation is to use the same momentum as in the relativistic case, then T_classical = p²/(2m) ≈ 1.0025 GeV, giving a difference of 2.5 MeV, close to option A.\n\nAlternatively, if the classical approximation is to use the same velocity as in the relativistic case, then T_classical = 0.995 GeV, giving a difference of 5 MeV, close to option C.\n\nBut which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe term \"classical approximation\" usually means replacing relativistic formulas with classical ones, while keeping the physical scenario the same. In this case, the physical scenario includes the same initial conditions (rest mass M, fission into fragments with rest masses 0.66M and 0.33M, with conservation of momentum and energy). Therefore, to perform the classical approximation, we would replace the relativistic energy-momentum relation with the classical one, while keeping the same momentum and energy conservation.\n\nHowever, in relativity, the energy is not just the kinetic energy plus rest energy, but includes the relation E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. In classical mechanics, the energy is just the kinetic energy plus rest energy, with kinetic energy being p²/(2m). Therefore, to perform the classical approximation, we would take the relativistic momentum (since it's derived from conservation laws) and plug it into the classical kinetic energy formula.\n\nThis is what I did in the last calculation, giving T_classical ≈ 1.0025 GeV, difference of 2.5 MeV, close to option A:2 MeV.\n\nBut why is this different from the earlier approach where we assumed the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV?\n\nBecause in that approach, we were using classical mechanics to distribute the kinetic energy, assuming it's 3 GeV. But in reality, in relativity, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, but in classical mechanics, if we use the same momentum, the total kinetic energy would be different.\n\nWait, let's compute the total classical kinetic energy in this case.\n\nFor both fragments, using the relativistic momentum p = 19.9248 GeV/c.\n\nT1_classical = p²/(2m1) ≈ 1.0025 GeV\n\nT2_classical = p²/(2m2) = p²/(2*(m1/2)) = 2 * p²/(2m1) = p²/m1 = 2 * T1_classical ≈ 2.005 GeV\n\nTotal classical kinetic energy: 1.0025 + 2.005 ≈ 3.0075 GeV, which is slightly more than the relativistic total of 3 GeV. This makes sense because the classical kinetic energy formula overestimates the kinetic energy for the same momentum.\n\nTherefore, if we were to calculate the classical approximation by taking the relativistic momentum and using it in the classical kinetic energy formula, the difference for T1 is 0.0025 GeV = 2.5 MeV, close to option A:2 MeV.\n\nGiven that the options are 2, 10, 5, 20, and this calculation gives approximately 2.5 MeV, the closest answer is A:2 MeV.\n\nBut let me do the calculation more precisely.\n\nWe had:\n\npc = sqrt(397) GeV ≈ 19.9248 GeV\n\nm1 c² = 198 GeV, so m1 = 198 GeV/c².\n\nT_classical = (pc)^2 / (2m1 c²) * c² = (397 GeV²) / (2 * 198 GeV) = 397 / 396 GeV ≈ 1.002525 GeV.\n\nCorrect T1 is 1 GeV. Difference is 0.002525 GeV = 2.525 MeV. So approximately 2.5 MeV, which is closest to option A:2 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A:2 MeV.\n\nBut why did the earlier approach, where I calculated the classical KE based on the relativistic velocity, give 7.5 MeV? Because that approach was incorrect, as it mixed relativistic velocity with classical KE, while the correct classical approximation is to use the relativistic momentum with classical KE formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is approximately 2.5 MeV, which corresponds to option A:2 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way this could be calculated.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the total kinetic energy in classical approximation is 3.0075 GeV, as calculated above. If the problem assumes that the classical calculation uses this total and distributes it as T1 = 1.0025 GeV, while the correct value is 1 GeV, the difference is 0.0025 GeV = 2.5 MeV. Hence, option A.\n\nGiven the options, and the calculation, I think the intended answer is A:2 MeV.\n\nBut let me verify with exact numbers.\n\nExact calculation:\n\npc = sqrt(397) GeV\n\nT_classical = (pc)^2 / (2m1 c²) = 397 / (2 * 198) GeV = 397 / 396 GeV ≈ 1.002525 GeV.\n\nDifference: 1.002525 - 1 = 0.002525 GeV = 2.525 MeV.\n\nYes, approximately 2.5 MeV, which rounds to 2 MeV, option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A:2 MeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
