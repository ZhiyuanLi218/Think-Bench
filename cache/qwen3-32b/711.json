The question is about the properties of four monochromatic lights: red, yellow, green, and blue. We need to determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts about light. I remember that different colors of light correspond to different wavelengths and frequencies. In the visible spectrum, the order from longest to shortest wavelength is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. So red has the longest wavelength and violet the shortest. Similarly, since frequency is inversely related to wavelength (since the speed of light is constant in a vacuum), red has the lowest frequency and violet the highest.\n\nNow, the question is about four specific colors: red, yellow, green, and blue. Let me list their approximate wavelengths to get a better idea. Red light is around 620-750 nm, yellow is about 570-590 nm, green is 520-570 nm, and blue is 450-495 nm. So in order from longest to shortest wavelength: red, yellow, green, blue. Therefore, their frequencies would be in the reverse order: blue has the highest frequency, then green, yellow, and red the lowest.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: In the same medium, green light has the highest refractive index. Hmm. The refractive index of a medium depends on the wavelength of light. Generally, for a given medium, the refractive index is higher for shorter wavelengths. This is known as normal dispersion. So, for example, in glass, blue light (shorter wavelength) has a higher refractive index than red light (longer wavelength). So among the four colors, blue would have the highest refractive index, then green, then yellow, then red. Therefore, if green has the highest refractive index among these four, that would only be true if there's a color with a longer wavelength than green but shorter than blue. But in the given options, green is between yellow and blue. Since blue has a shorter wavelength than green, blue would have a higher refractive index. So option A says green has the highest refractive index, but blue should have a higher one. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Red light has the highest frequency. Wait, earlier I thought red has the longest wavelength, which means the lowest frequency. Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength (f = c/λ), the longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency. So red, with the longest wavelength, should have the lowest frequency, not the highest. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: In the same medium, blue light has the shortest wavelength. Well, in a medium, the wavelength of light is λ = λ0 / n, where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength and n is the refractive index. However, the question is about the wavelength in the medium. But since the refractive index varies with wavelength, the actual wavelength in the medium depends on both the original wavelength and the refractive index. However, the question is phrased as \"blue light has the shortest wavelength\" in the same medium. If all four colors are in the same medium, their wavelengths in that medium would be λ = λ0 / n. However, since blue has the shortest original wavelength (λ0), and assuming that the refractive index for blue is higher than for the others (as per normal dispersion), the denominator is larger, making λ in the medium even shorter. Wait, but if λ0 is shorter for blue, and n is higher for blue, then λ in the medium would be λ0 / n. Let me think: suppose two colors, red and blue. Red has longer λ0 but lower n. So for red, λ_medium = λ0_red / n_red. For blue, λ_medium = λ0_blue / n_blue. Since λ0_blue < λ0_red and n_blue > n_red, which of these is smaller? Let's take numbers. Suppose red has λ0 = 700 nm, n_red = 1.5. Then λ_medium_red = 700 / 1.5 ≈ 466.67 nm. For blue, λ0 = 450 nm, n_blue = 1.6. Then λ_medium_blue = 450 / 1.6 ≈ 281.25 nm. So even though blue's original wavelength is shorter, in the medium, it's even shorter compared to red. Therefore, blue's wavelength in the medium is the shortest. Therefore, option C is correct? Wait, but the question is about four colors: red, yellow, green, blue. So blue has the shortest original wavelength, and in the medium, with higher refractive index, so its wavelength in the medium is the shortest. Therefore, option C is correct? But wait, the question says \"In the same medium, blue light has the shortest wavelength.\" So yes, if all four are in the same medium, blue's wavelength in the medium is the shortest. Therefore, C is correct. But let me check again. Suppose another color, say green. Let's take numbers. Let's assume a medium where n increases with decreasing wavelength. For example, in glass. Let's say for red, λ0=700 nm, n_red=1.5. Yellow: λ0=580 nm, n_yellow=1.55. Green: λ0=550 nm, n_green=1.58. Blue: λ0=450 nm, n_blue=1.6. Then in the medium: red's λ is 700/1.5≈466.67 nm, yellow: 580/1.55≈374.19 nm, green: 550/1.58≈348.10 nm, blue: 450/1.6≈281.25 nm. So blue's wavelength in the medium is the shortest. So option C is correct. Therefore, C is a correct statement.\n\nOption D: Yellow light photons have the least energy. The energy of a photon is E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, the longer the wavelength, the lower the energy. The order of wavelengths is red > yellow > green > blue. Therefore, red has the lowest frequency and thus the least energy per photon. Yellow would have higher energy than red but lower than green and blue. Therefore, the least energy would be red, not yellow. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo among the options, A is incorrect (green isn't the highest refractive index; blue is), B is incorrect (red has lowest frequency), C is correct (blue has shortest wavelength in medium), D is incorrect (yellow's energy is higher than red's). Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
