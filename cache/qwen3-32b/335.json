The options are KCl, Fe(NO3)3, MgSO4, and N2H4. Let me start by recalling what distillation does. Distillation is a process used to separate components in a mixture based on their different boiling points. When you heat the solution, the component with the lower boiling point will vaporize first, and then you can condense that vapor back into a liquid, effectively separating it from the others.\n\nBut wait, all these compounds are dissolved in water, right? So the solution is aqueous. So when I think about distillation, I need to consider whether the solute itself will vaporize or if the water will vaporize. Since the question is about separating the compounds, I suppose we're trying to separate one of the solutes from the water. So if a solute is volatile (has a low enough boiling point to vaporize), then it might be possible to separate it via distillation. However, if the solute is non-volatile, meaning it doesn't vaporize easily, then distillation would just leave the solute behind as the water evaporates.\n\nSo the key here is to determine which of these compounds is volatile. Let's look at each one:\n\n1. KCl (Potassium Chloride): This is an ionic compound. Ionic compounds generally have high boiling points and are not volatile. When you distill a KCl solution, the water would evaporate, leaving KCl behind. So you can't really separate KCl via distillation because it doesn't vaporize. Instead, you'd get rid of the water, leaving the KCl. But the question is about separating the compounds, not necessarily removing the water. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The question is which compound is easiest to separate via distillation. If the compound is non-volatile, then distillation would not help in separating it from the water. Instead, you'd need evaporation to remove the water and leave the solute. So if the goal is to separate the solute from the water, distillation would be used for volatile solutes. For non-volatile solutes, evaporation is the method. Therefore, KCl being non-volatile, distillation isn't the right method to separate it. So KCl is out.\n\n2. Fe(NO3)3 (Iron(III) Nitrate): Another ionic compound. Similar to KCl, it's probably non-volatile. So again, distillation would just evaporate the water, leaving Fe(NO3)3 behind. So same as KCl, not suitable for distillation.\n\n3. MgSO4 (Magnesium Sulfate): Also an ionic compound. Non-volatile. So same reasoning as above. Distillation would not work here. So not the answer.\n\n4. N2H4 (Hydrazine): This is a molecular compound. Hydrazine is a liquid at room temperature, and I think it has a boiling point around 113-114 degrees Celsius. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. So if you have a solution of hydrazine in water, then heating it would cause water to boil off first, but hydrazine has a higher boiling point. Wait, but if you want to separate hydrazine from water, you'd need to heat it past 100°C but before it reaches 114°C. However, hydrazine is a volatile compound compared to the ionic salts. So if you have a solution of hydrazine in water, you could potentially distill it by heating it to a temperature between 100°C and 114°C, causing hydrazine to vaporize while leaving the water behind? Wait, no. Wait, hydrazine's boiling point is higher than water. So if you heat the solution, water would boil off first. So to get hydrazine to vaporize, you'd have to heat it beyond the boiling point of water. But if you do that, the water would already have evaporated. So perhaps in a mixture with water, you can't separate hydrazine by simple distillation because the water would evaporate first. Unless hydrazine is more volatile than water, but since its boiling point is higher, it's less volatile. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the nature of the compounds. The question is which compound is easiest to separate via distillation. If the compound is a non-volatile solute (like the ionic compounds), then distillation isn't the way to go. But if the solute is volatile, then you can distill it out. However, all of these are dissolved in water. So unless the solute is a liquid that's miscible with water, but with a different boiling point. Wait, N2H4 is hydrazine. Hydrazine is a liquid that can be dissolved in water. Its boiling point is higher than water, so if you have a solution of hydrazine in water, you could use fractional distillation to separate them based on their different boiling points. Since hydrazine's boiling point is higher, you'd first get water vapor, and then at higher temperatures, hydrazine would vaporize. But the problem is that hydrazine might decompose before reaching its boiling point. Wait, but let me check the boiling point. Hydrazine's boiling point is about 113.5°C. So if you have a solution of hydrazine in water, you can first distill off the water, and then the hydrazine would come over next. But if the question is about separating the compound from the others, perhaps the idea is that the hydrazine is the only volatile component, so you can distill it out while the other salts remain in solution. Wait, but all the other compounds are ionic and non-volatile. So if you have a mixture of all four compounds in solution, and you want to separate one of them via distillation, which one can be separated?\n\nWait, the problem is that all the other compounds (KCl, Fe(NO3)3, MgSO4) are non-volatile and would remain in the solution as the water is boiled off. However, N2H4 is a volatile compound. So if you have a solution of N2H4 in water, you can distill the water off, but N2H4 would remain. But if you want to separate N2H4 from the others, maybe you can use steam distillation or some other method. Wait, but in a mixture with other salts, the water would carry the volatile N2H4. Alternatively, maybe the idea is that N2H4 is a liquid and can be separated via distillation by heating the solution to a temperature where water and N2H4 have different boiling points. But since N2H4's boiling point is higher than water, you would first get water vapor, and then at higher temps, N2H4 would vaporize. So in a mixture with the other salts, you can distill off the water first, and then the N2H4. However, the other salts (KCl, Fe(NO3)3, MgSO4) would be left in the solution as the water is boiled off. So if you want to separate N2H4 from the solution, you could do so by distilling it after the water has been removed. But the question is phrased as \"which of these compounds would be easiest to separate via distillation.\" Since the other three are ionic and non-volatile, they can't be distilled off. The only volatile component is N2H4. Therefore, if you have a solution containing all four, and you want to separate one of them via distillation, the only one that can be separated is N2H4. Because when you heat the solution, the water would start to boil, but N2H4 has a higher boiling point. Wait, but how does that help? If you want to separate N2H4 from the solution, maybe you need to distill it after the water is gone. But distillation usually separates components based on their boiling points. So if you have a mixture of water and N2H4, you can use fractional distillation to collect the water first, then the N2H4. But in the presence of the other salts, the N2H4 is dissolved in water with the salts. So if you distill the solution, the water would come off first, and the N2H4 would remain in the solution along with the salts. Wait, but if the N2H4 is more volatile than the salts, but the salts are non-volatile. Wait, no, the salts are non-volatile, so they don't vaporize at all. So if you distill the solution, you'd first get water vapor, then after all the water is gone, you could distill the N2H4. But in reality, the N2H4 is dissolved in water, so you can't really separate it via distillation unless you can get it to vaporize before all the water is gone. Since N2H4 has a higher boiling point than water, it's less volatile. So maybe the correct answer is that N2H4 is the only one that can be separated via distillation, but you have to first distill off the water, then distill the N2H4. But the other salts would be left in the solution. So the question is asking which of the four is easiest to separate via distillation. Since the other three are non-volatile, they can't be separated via distillation (they would require evaporation to remove the water), while N2H4 is volatile and can be separated via distillation once the water is removed. Therefore, the answer is D: N2H4(aq).\n\nWait, but maybe there's another angle. For example, sometimes when you have a solution with multiple solutes, you can use fractional distillation to separate based on their solubility and volatility. But in this case, all the other solutes are ionic and non-volatile. The only volatile component is N2H4. So distillation would allow you to separate N2H4 from the others. So D is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
