Let me start by recalling what I know about standing waves on strings. \n\nFirst, the problem mentions a string with a linear mass density of 0.15 g/cm. Hmm, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me convert that to kg/m because standard SI units are usually better for physics problems. So 0.15 grams per centimeter... There are 1000 grams in a kilogram and 100 centimeters in a meter. So, 0.15 g/cm is equal to 0.15 kg/m divided by 1000? Wait, no. Wait, grams to kilograms is dividing by 1000, and centimeters to meters is multiplying by 100. So linear mass density μ is 0.15 g/cm = 0.15 * (1 kg / 1000 g) / (1 m / 100 cm) ) = 0.15 * (1/1000) / (1/100) kg/m. That simplifies to 0.15 * (1/10) kg/m. So 0.015 kg/m. Let me check that again. 0.15 grams per centimeter. So per meter, there are 100 centimeters. So 0.15 g/cm * 100 cm/m = 15 g/m. Then converting grams to kg, divide by 1000: 15 / 1000 = 0.015 kg/m. Yes, that's right. So μ = 0.015 kg/m.\n\nThe tuning fork has a frequency of 50 Hz. The other end is over a pulley with a weight of mass M. The distance from the tuning fork to the pulley is 1 meter. So the length of the string is 1 meter. When the tuning fork vibrates, we need three antinodes. The vibration amplitude is small, so the tuning fork is approximately at a node. So the setup is like a standing wave on a string fixed at one end and free at the other? Wait, but if the other end is over a pulley and suspended with a weight, does that mean it's fixed or free? Hmm. If the string is under tension due to the weight, but the end is free to move vertically, right? Because the pulley just changes the direction of the force. So the end is free to move, so it would be an antinode. Whereas the tuning fork is at a node because the amplitude is very small. So the boundary conditions are: one end is a node (tuning fork) and the other end is an antinode (pulley end). \n\nWait, but standing waves on a string with one end fixed and one end free have specific harmonics. For such a case, the possible wavelengths are given by λ = 4L/n, where n is an odd integer (1, 3, 5,...). Because the fundamental mode (first harmonic) has a node at one end and antinode at the other, which is a quarter wavelength. Then the next possible is three-quarters of a wavelength, then five-quarters, etc. So the number of antinodes? For the first harmonic, there is one antinode. For the third harmonic, there would be three antinodes? Wait, let me think. Let me visualize. If it's a quarter wavelength, then there's one antinode. For three-quarters of a wavelength, you have a node, then antinode, node, antinode? Wait, no. If you have a string fixed at one end and free at the other, the standing wave pattern for the nth harmonic (where n is odd) has (n+1)/2 antinodes. For example, n=1 (first harmonic): (1+1)/2 = 1 antinode. For n=3 (third harmonic): (3+1)/2 = 2 antinodes. Wait, that seems conflicting with the question which asks for three antinodes. Wait, maybe my formula is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the number of antinodes. For a string fixed at one end and free at the other, the harmonics are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. Each harmonic adds a node and an antinode. The fundamental (first harmonic) has one antinode. The third harmonic would have two antinodes? Wait, let me draw it mentally. First harmonic: node at fixed end, antinode at free end. Second harmonic would be impossible because it would require a node at the free end, which isn't possible. Third harmonic: node, antinode, node, antinode. Wait, so between the fixed end and free end, there are two nodes and two antinodes? Wait, if the length is three-quarters of a wavelength. So the pattern would be node, then antinode, then node, then antinode. But since the free end is an antinode, the last point is an antinode. So between the fixed end and free end, there are two antinodes? Wait, maybe three antinodes? Hmm, maybe I need to recall the formula for the number of antinodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this problem using the general formula for standing waves. The general condition for standing waves is that the length of the string must be an integer multiple of half-wavelengths or something like that. But since one end is a node and the other is an antinode, the condition is different.\n\nFor a standing wave with a node at one end and antinode at the other, the length L of the string is equal to an odd multiple of quarter wavelengths. So:\n\nL = (2n - 1) * λ / 4, where n = 1, 2, 3,...\n\nWhich can be rewritten as λ = 4L / (2n - 1). Here, n is the number of quarter wavelengths. But how does this relate to the number of antinodes?\n\nFor n=1: λ = 4L / 1 => L = λ/4. This is the fundamental mode, with one antinode at the free end.\n\nFor n=2: λ = 4L / 3 => L = 3λ/4. This would correspond to three-quarters of a wavelength. So the standing wave pattern would have two antinodes? Let me imagine: starting at the node, going up to antinode, down to node, up to antinode. But since the length is 3λ/4, the free end is at an antinode. So between the node and antinode, there's a node in the middle. So there are two antinodes? Wait, no, there is one antinode at the free end and another somewhere in between? Wait, if you have three quarters of a wavelength, then the pattern would be node, antinode, node, antinode. But since the length is three quarters, the last antinode is at the free end. So there are two antinodes? So for n=2, two antinodes. Similarly, for n=3, λ = 4L / 5, so L = 5λ/4. Then the pattern would be node, antinode, node, antinode, node, antinode. So three antinodes? Yes. So in general, the number of antinodes is equal to n. Wait, when n=1, one antinode; n=2, two antinodes; n=3, three antinodes. Therefore, if we want three antinodes, n=3. Therefore, the wavelength is λ = 4L / (2n - 1) = 4L / (2*3 - 1) = 4L / 5. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait if n in this case is the number of antinodes? Wait, no, the formula I had was L = (2n - 1) * λ / 4, where n is 1, 2, 3,... So for the first case, n=1, L = λ/4. For the second case, n=2, L= 3λ/4. For the third case, n=3, L=5λ/4. Therefore, if we want three antinodes, which corresponds to n=3? But earlier I thought that for n=3, there are three antinodes. Wait, let me check again. For n=1: one antinode. For n=2: two antinodes. For n=3: three antinodes. So yes, if we want three antinodes, we need the third harmonic? But in the case of a string fixed at one end and free at the other, the harmonics are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. Wait, but here n is not the harmonic number. The harmonic number would be the number of the odd multiple. For example, the fundamental is first harmonic (n=1), then third harmonic (n=2?), no. Wait, maybe there is confusion here. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me recall that for a string with one end fixed and one end free, only odd harmonics are present. The fundamental frequency (first harmonic) is f1 = v / 4L. The third harmonic would be 3f1 = 3v / 4L. The fifth harmonic would be 5f1 = 5v / 4L. So in general, the nth harmonic (where n is odd) is given by fn = n*v/(4L). However, here the number of antinodes corresponds to (n + 1)/2? For example, first harmonic (n=1): (1 + 1)/2 = 1 antinode. Third harmonic (n=3): (3 + 1)/2 = 2 antinodes. Fifth harmonic (n=5): 3 antinodes. Wait, so if we want three antinodes, that would correspond to the fifth harmonic, n=5. Therefore, the frequency would be f = 5v/(4L). \n\nBut the problem says that the frequency is fixed by the tuning fork, which is 50 Hz. Therefore, we need to adjust the tension in the string (by changing mass M) so that the fifth harmonic corresponds to 50 Hz. Therefore, let's formalize this.\n\nFirst, the frequency of the nth harmonic (where n is odd) is f = n*v/(4L). Here, we need f = 50 Hz, n=5 (for three antinodes), so:\n\n50 Hz = 5*v / (4L)\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv = (50 Hz * 4L) / 5 = (50 * 4 * 1 m) / 5 = (200 / 5) m/s = 40 m/s.\n\nSo the wave speed needs to be 40 m/s.\n\nNow, the wave speed on a string is given by v = sqrt(T/μ), where T is the tension in the string and μ is the linear mass density. Therefore, we can solve for T:\n\nT = μ*v².\n\nWe have μ = 0.015 kg/m (as calculated earlier), and v = 40 m/s.\n\nSo T = 0.015 kg/m * (40 m/s)^2 = 0.015 * 1600 N = 24 N.\n\nTherefore, the tension T must be 24 Newtons. Since the tension is provided by the weight Mg, where M is the mass and g is acceleration due to gravity (assuming standard gravity, 9.8 m/s²), we can solve for M:\n\nM = T / g = 24 N / 9.8 m/s² ≈ 2.44898 kg.\n\nSo approximately 2.45 kg. Let me check if all steps are correct.\n\nFirst, confirming the number of antinodes. The problem says three antinodes. For a string fixed at one end and free at the other, the pattern is node...antinode...node...antinode...node...antinode. For three antinodes, there must be five segments? Wait, no. Wait, for each additional antinode, you add a node and an antinode. Let me think again. The first harmonic (fundamental): node at fixed end, then antinode at free end. One antinode. The next possible is adding a node and antinode: node, antinode, node, antinode. That would be two antinodes. Then adding another node and antinode: node, antinode, node, antinode, node, antinode. Three antinodes. So each time you add two segments (node-antinode), you add one more antinode. The length of the string in each case is (2n - 1) * λ / 4, where n is the number of antinodes? Wait, when there is 1 antinode, n=1: L = λ/4. When there are 2 antinodes, n=2: L = 3λ/4. For 3 antinodes, n=3: L=5λ/4. Therefore, in general, L = (2n - 1) * λ / 4, where n is the number of antinodes. Therefore, solving for λ: λ = 4L / (2n - 1). \n\nGiven that, the frequency is f = v / λ. But also, since the wave is in the nth mode (with n antinodes), and for a string fixed at one end and free at the other, the frequency is f = (2n - 1) * v / (4L). Wait, if n is the number of antinodes, then f = (2n - 1) * v / (4L). Therefore, if we have three antinodes, n=3, so f = (2*3 - 1)*v/(4L) = 5v/(4L). Which is what I had earlier. Therefore, solving for v gives v = (4L f)/5. Which with L=1 m, f=50 Hz, gives v= (4*1*50)/5=40 m/s. Correct.\n\nThen, calculating tension T = μ v². μ is 0.015 kg/m, so T=0.015*(40)^2=0.015*1600=24 N. Then M = T/g =24 / 9.8. Let me compute that more accurately. 24 divided by 9.8. Well, 9.8*2=19.6, 24-19.6=4.4. 4.4/9.8≈0.4489. So total is 2 + 0.4489 ≈ 2.4489 kg. So approximately 2.45 kg. Depending on what value of g is expected. If the problem expects g=9.8 m/s², then that's the answer. If they want a different value, like 9.81 or 10, but since they didn't specify, 9.8 is standard.\n\nBut let me check if there is any mistake in the number of antinodes. The problem says three antinodes. If I had considered that the formula is different... Suppose someone thinks that the number of antinodes is equal to the harmonic number, but in this case, since only odd harmonics exist, maybe there's confusion. But according to the previous reasoning, three antinodes correspond to the fifth harmonic (since f = 5v/(4L)), so n=5 in the harmonic series. But the number of antinodes is 3. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this problem by considering the standing wave pattern. For three antinodes, how many half-wavelengths are there? Wait, in a string fixed at both ends, the number of antinodes is equal to the number of half-wavelengths. But here it's fixed at one end and free at the other. So for a node at one end and antinode at the other, the number of quarter wavelengths is odd. So three antinodes would mean that there are 2.5 wavelengths? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nEach antinode is separated by half a wavelength? No, in a standing wave, nodes are separated by half a wavelength. Antinodes are also separated by half a wavelength. Between a node and an antinode is a quarter wavelength. \n\nSo if there are three antinodes, starting from a node (fixed end), then going to antinode (1/4 λ), then node (1/2 λ from start?), no. Let me try to count. Starting at the node (fixed end). To get to the first antinode, that's 1/4 λ. Then to get to the next node, another 1/4 λ (total 1/2 λ). Then to the next antinode, another 1/4 λ (total 3/4 λ). Then to the next node, another 1/4 λ (total 1 λ). Then to the next antinode (free end), another 1/4 λ (total 5/4 λ). Therefore, the total length L = 5/4 λ. Therefore, λ = 4L/5. Therefore, the wavelength is 4L/5. Therefore, frequency f = v / λ = v * 5 / (4L). Therefore, solving for v = 4Lf / 5. Which is same as before. Therefore, correct. So with L=1 m, f=50 Hz, v=40 m/s. Then T=μv²=0.015*1600=24 N. Therefore, M=24 / 9.8≈2.449 kg. \n\nSo the answer should be approximately 2.45 kg. Let me check if the question expects an exact fraction or decimal. Since 24 / 9.8 can be written as 240 / 98 = 120 / 49 ≈ 2.44897959... So approximately 2.45 kg. Depending on significant figures. The given data: linear mass density is 0.15 g/cm, which is two significant figures. The frequency is 50 Hz, which is maybe one or two? If it's 50 Hz, it might be considered as two significant figures. The length is 1 m, which is one significant figure? Hmm, but maybe in the problem's context, the length is exactly 1 m. However, given that the linear mass density is given as 0.15 g/cm (two decimal places but in grams per centimeter, converted to 0.015 kg/m which is two significant figures). The frequency is 50 Hz, possibly two significant figures. So the answer should be two significant figures? Then 2.4 kg? Wait, 2.4489... with two significant figures would be 2.4. But if the length is 1.0 m (two significant figures), but the problem says 1 m. Hmm. The problem says \"the distance from the tuning fork to the pulley is 1 m\". If it's written as 1 m, it might be considered as one significant figure. But in many textbooks, sometimes 1 m is considered as exact. However, given that other quantities have two significant figures (0.15 g/cm and 50 Hz), maybe the answer should have two significant figures. Therefore, 2.4 kg? Wait, 2.4489 is approximately 2.4 if we take two significant figures. Wait, but 2.4489 is 2.4 when rounded to two decimal places? No, significant figures. Let me think. If the original data has two significant figures, then the answer should have two. Let me check the original numbers:\n\nLinear mass density: 0.15 g/cm – two significant figures.\n\nFrequency: 50 Hz – ambiguous, but possibly one or two. If it's written as 50 Hz without a decimal, it might be considered one significant figure, but sometimes trailing zeros can be ambiguous. However, in many cases, 50 Hz could be two significant figures if the precision is known. The length is 1 m – again, one significant figure. However, in practical problems like this, sometimes the numbers are treated as exact. For example, the length might be exactly 1 meter, the frequency is exactly 50 Hz. In that case, the significant figures would be determined by the linear mass density, which is two. Therefore, the answer would be 2.4 kg. However, since 0.15 g/cm is two decimal places but in grams per centimeter, converting to kg/m is 0.015 kg/m, which is two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be two significant figures. Therefore, 2.4 kg. However, my calculation is approximately 2.4489 kg. If I write 2.4 kg, that's two significant figures. But if the problem expects more precise answer, maybe they want the exact value. Let me check the exact value. 24 divided by 9.8. Let me compute 24 / 9.8. \n\nWell, 9.8 * 2.4 = 23.52. 24 - 23.52 = 0.48. So 0.48 / 9.8 ≈ 0.04898. Therefore, total is 2.4 + 0.04898 ≈ 2.44898. So approximately 2.45 kg. If I take g as 9.81 m/s², then 24 / 9.81 ≈ 2.446 kg. Still approximately 2.45 kg. So depending on what's expected. In most textbooks, they might use g = 9.8 m/s² and expect the answer to be 2.4 kg with two significant figures, but maybe here since 0.15 has two decimal places but is in grams per centimeter, maybe they expect more precise answer. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact fraction. Wait, 24 / 9.8 is equal to 240 / 98 = 120 / 49 ≈ 2.44897959... So 120/49 kg. But that's probably not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of antinodes. Let me check again. Suppose instead of three antinodes, the problem is referring to three loops. Wait, in some contexts, a loop is a segment between two nodes. But in this case, with one end fixed and one free, the number of loops would be equal to the number of antinodes? Not sure. Let me think. For example, in the fundamental mode (one antinode), there is one loop (from node to antinode). In the third harmonic (two antinodes), there are two loops? Or three? Wait, no. If you have node, antinode, node, antinode. So between the fixed end and free end, there is a node, antinode, node, antinode. So there are two segments between nodes? No, only one node in between. So the length is three quarters of a wavelength. So there is one loop (from node to antinode to node) and then another quarter wavelength to the antinode. So maybe it's not straightforward. \n\nBut since the earlier derivation using the formula for frequency gave me a consistent result, and the calculation checks out, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the mass M is approximately 2.45 kg. Depending on rounding, maybe 2.4 kg or 2.45 kg. Since in most cases, two decimal places might be acceptable here. Let me check with exact calculation:\n\nIf μ is 0.15 g/cm = 0.015 kg/m, exact value. Then v = 40 m/s, exact. Tension T = μ*v² = 0.015*(40)^2 = 0.015*1600 = 24 N, exact. Then M = 24 / 9.8. If we take g = 9.8 m/s², exact, then M is 24 / 9.8 = 2.448979... kg. So if the problem expects the answer in kg, with two decimal places, maybe 2.45 kg. \n\nAlternatively, if the question is from a textbook, maybe there's an exact value. Let me check if I did everything correctly. \n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to use the formula for the nth harmonic. For a string with one end fixed and the other free, the nth harmonic (where n is odd) has frequency f = (n/(4L)) * sqrt(T/μ). Wait, let me check. The wave speed is sqrt(T/μ), and the frequency is (n*v)/(4L). So substituting v:\n\nf = (n/(4L)) * sqrt(T/μ). Therefore, solving for T:\n\nsqrt(T/μ) = 4L f / n\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nT/μ = (16 L² f²) / n²\n\nTherefore, T = μ * (16 L² f²)/n²\n\nTherefore, T = (16 μ L² f²)/n²\n\nBut we also have T = Mg.\n\nSo Mg = (16 μ L² f²)/n²\n\nTherefore, M = (16 μ L² f²)/(n² g)\n\nNow, in this case, we need to determine n. As before, the number of antinodes is (n + 1)/2? Wait, earlier we had that for n harmonics (where n is the harmonic number, odd integers), the number of antinodes is (n + 1)/2. For example, n=1: (1+1)/2=1 antinode. n=3: (3+1)/2=2 antinodes. n=5: 3 antinodes. Therefore, if we want three antinodes, n=5. Therefore, substituting n=5:\n\nM = (16 * 0.015 kg/m * (1 m)^2 * (50 Hz)^2 ) / (5^2 * 9.8 m/s² )\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n16 * 0.015 * 1 * 2500 = 16 * 0.015 * 2500\n\nFirst compute 0.015 * 2500 = 37.5\n\nThen 16 * 37.5 = 600\n\nDenominator:\n\n25 * 9.8 = 245\n\nTherefore, M = 600 / 245 ≈ 2.448979... kg. Same result. Therefore, correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.45 kg. \n\nSince the problem says \"what should be the mass M of the weight\", and unless specified otherwise, I think giving it to two decimal places is acceptable. However, maybe the answer is expected in fractions or something else. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the value of μ? Let me check again. Original μ is 0.15 g/cm. Converting to kg/m:\n\n0.15 g/cm = 0.15 g / cm = 0.15 * 10^-3 kg / (10^-2 m) ) = 0.15 * 10^-1 kg/m = 0.015 kg/m. Correct. \n\nYes, so all steps are correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.45 kg. Depending on the problem's requirement, maybe boxed as \\boxed{2.45} kg. However, let me check if there is a calculation mistake. Let me recompute M:\n\nM = 600 / 245. Let me divide 600 by 245. 245*2=490. 600-490=110. 245*0.4=98. 110-98=12. So 2.4 + 12/245 ≈ 2.4 + 0.0489 ≈ 2.4489. Correct. So yes, 2.45 kg. \n\nAlternatively, if the question is from a textbook where they use g=9.81, then:\n\nM = 24 / 9.81 ≈ 2.446 kg ≈ 2.45 kg. Still approximately the same. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 2.45 kg. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mass $ M $ of the weight should be \\boxed{2.45} kilograms.\n</think>"}
