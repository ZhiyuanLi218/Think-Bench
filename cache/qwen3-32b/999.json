Let me start by recalling what D'Alembert's principle is. From what I remember, it's a method used in dynamics to convert a problem of motion into an equivalent statics problem by introducing inertial forces. So, essentially, we can treat the accelerating system as if it's in equilibrium by adding fictitious forces. \n\nFirst, let me visualize the setup. There's a uniform thin rod AB that can rotate freely about a horizontal axis through point O. This horizontal axis is itself rotating at a constant angular velocity ω around a vertical axis through point O. So, point O is fixed, and the entire horizontal axis is spinning around the vertical axis, causing the rod AB to rotate in some way. The rod has two segments: OA with length a and OB with length b. The question is asking for the angle α that the rod makes with the vertical during steady rotation. \n\nSince it's a uniform rod, its mass distribution is even. Let me denote the total mass of the rod as m. However, since OA and OB are different lengths, maybe I need to consider the mass distribution more carefully. Wait, OA and OB are parts of the same rod? So the entire rod AB has length a + b, with O somewhere between A and B such that OA = a and OB = b. So the total length of the rod is a + b. \n\nBut since it's a uniform rod, the mass per unit length is constant. Let me denote the mass per unit length as λ = m / (a + b), where m is the total mass. Therefore, the mass of segment OA is λ * a, and the mass of segment OB is λ * b. \n\nNow, the rod is rotating about the horizontal axis through O, which itself is rotating about the vertical axis through O at angular velocity ω. So, this seems like a case of a body undergoing rotation about two axes. The horizontal axis is rotating around the vertical axis, which is a classic case of a rotating frame of reference. \n\nSince the motion is steady, the angular velocity is constant, so there's no angular acceleration. Therefore, the system is in a steady-state rotation. \n\nD'Alembert's principle says that the sum of the applied forces plus the inertial forces equals zero for the system in motion. So, I need to consider all the real forces acting on the rod and the inertial forces due to the rotation. \n\nThe real forces on the rod would be gravity. Since the rod is uniform, the center of mass is located at the midpoint of AB. Let me denote the midpoint as G. Since OA = a and OB = b, the total length AB = a + b, so the midpoint G is located at a distance of (a + b)/2 from point A. But since O is located at a distance a from A and b from B, the position of G relative to O can be calculated. \n\nLet me compute the position of the center of mass (G) relative to point O. The center of mass of a uniform rod is at its midpoint. The distance from O to G can be found by considering the positions of A and B relative to O. If OA = a, then the coordinate of A relative to O is -a (if I take O as the origin along the rod), and the coordinate of B relative to O is +b. The midpoint G would then be at position ( (-a) + b ) / 2 = (b - a)/2 relative to O along the rod. Wait, but this is along the rod. However, since the rod is rotating in space, the position of G in space will depend on the angle α. \n\nBut maybe I need to think in terms of coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me consider point O as the origin. The vertical axis is the z-axis, and the horizontal axis through O (around which the rod can rotate) is rotating about the z-axis at angular velocity ω. Let me define a coordinate system where, at any instant, the horizontal axis is in the x-y plane. However, since the horizontal axis is rotating about the z-axis, the orientation of the rod's axis of rotation (the horizontal axis) is changing with time. \n\nBut since we are in steady rotation, the angle α is constant. Therefore, the rod is rotating about the horizontal axis with some angular velocity, and this horizontal axis is rotating about the vertical axis with angular velocity ω. Wait, but is there another angular velocity? The problem says that the rod can rotate freely about the horizontal axis. However, during steady rotation, is the rod rotating about the horizontal axis? Or is it just that the horizontal axis is rotating about the vertical axis, and the rod is fixed in its own axis? \n\nWait, the problem says \"during steady rotation,\" so maybe the rod is rotating about the horizontal axis with some angular velocity, which is related to the angular velocity ω of the horizontal axis about the vertical axis. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. The rod is free to rotate about the horizontal axis through O. The horizontal axis is rotating at angular velocity ω about the vertical axis through O. So, imagine the horizontal axis is like a turntable rotating at ω, and the rod is mounted on the turntable, able to rotate freely about the horizontal axis. In steady motion, the rod is not rotating about the horizontal axis, or is it? \n\nWait, if the rod is free to rotate, then in the absence of external torques, it would want to stay in its orientation. However, because the horizontal axis is rotating, the rod might experience some centrifugal force causing it to tilt. Therefore, in steady rotation, the rod is in equilibrium under the action of gravity and the inertial forces due to the rotation. \n\nTherefore, the rod is not rotating about the horizontal axis (i.e., its angular velocity about the horizontal axis is zero in the steady state), but the horizontal axis itself is rotating about the vertical axis. Therefore, every point on the rod is undergoing circular motion about the vertical axis with angular velocity ω. However, the rod is also tilted at an angle α with respect to the vertical. \n\nSo, to model this, I need to consider the centrifugal force acting on each mass element of the rod due to the rotation about the vertical axis. Then, using D'Alembert's principle, I can consider these centrifugal forces as inertial forces and balance them with the gravitational forces to find the equilibrium angle α. \n\nLet me try to formalize this. \n\nFirst, let me consider the rod AB with point O fixed. The rod makes an angle α with the vertical. Therefore, the horizontal axis (about which the rod can rotate) is itself rotating at angular velocity ω about the vertical axis. \n\nEach mass element dm of the rod is moving in a circular path about the vertical axis with angular velocity ω. The radius of this circular path depends on the position of dm relative to the vertical axis. \n\nBut since the rod is rotating about the horizontal axis, which is itself rotating about the vertical axis, the position of dm in space depends on both the angle α and the position along the rod. \n\nLet me try to find the radius of the circular path for each dm. \n\nLet me consider a coordinate system with origin at O. Let me define the vertical axis as z-axis. The horizontal axis through O (the axis about which the rod can rotate) is rotating about the z-axis with angular velocity ω. Let me assume that at a particular instant, the horizontal axis lies in the x-z plane, making an angle α with the vertical. Wait, no. If the rod is making an angle α with the vertical, then the horizontal axis is... Wait, the horizontal axis is fixed in space? No, the horizontal axis is rotating about the vertical axis. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to define a coordinate system. Let me imagine that the horizontal axis is rotating about the vertical axis (z-axis) with angular velocity ω. Let me consider a coordinate system where, at a given instant, the horizontal axis is in the x-z plane. The rod AB is free to rotate about this horizontal axis. In steady motion, the rod is at an angle α with respect to the vertical. Therefore, the rod is in a plane that is rotating with angular velocity ω about the z-axis. \n\nLet me think of the rod as making an angle α with the vertical. Therefore, if the horizontal axis is in the x-z plane, then the rod lies in a plane that is inclined at angle α from the vertical. The projection of the rod onto the horizontal plane (x-y) would depend on α. \n\nTo find the radius of the circular motion for each dm, I need to find the distance from dm to the z-axis. Let me parametrize the rod. Let me take a coordinate along the rod from point O. Let me denote a coordinate s, which goes from -a to +b, where s = 0 is at point O, s = -a is at point A, and s = +b is at point B. Wait, but if OA = a and OB = b, then if I take O as the origin, then point A is at distance a from O, but in which direction? If the rod is making an angle α with the vertical, then the direction from O to A is along the rod. \n\nLet me think in terms of position vectors. Let me define the position vector of a general point on the rod. Let me consider that the horizontal axis is rotating about the z-axis with angular velocity ω. At any instant, let me take the horizontal axis to lie in the x-z plane. The rod is inclined at angle α from the vertical. Therefore, the rod lies in a plane that contains the z-axis and makes an angle α with the vertical. Wait, no. If the horizontal axis is rotating about the z-axis, then the horizontal axis is itself rotating. The rod is free to rotate about this horizontal axis. In steady motion, the rod is at a fixed angle α relative to the vertical. \n\nLet me try to find the position vector of a general point on the rod. Let me consider that the rod is in a plane that is rotating about the z-axis. Let me take a coordinate system where, at a particular instant, the horizontal axis is along the x-axis. Wait, no, the horizontal axis is rotating about the z-axis. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the horizontal axis is rotating about the z-axis with angular velocity ω. Let me define a rotating coordinate system (x', y', z') where the x'-axis is the horizontal axis about which the rod rotates. The z'-axis is the same as the z-axis (vertical). The y'-axis is perpendicular to x' and z', so it's horizontal and perpendicular to the horizontal axis. \n\nIn this rotating frame, the rod can rotate about the x'-axis. However, in steady motion, the rod is at a fixed angle α with respect to the vertical. Therefore, in this rotating frame, the rod is stationary, making an angle α with the z'-axis (which is vertical). \n\nBut since we are using D'Alembert's principle, we can consider the inertial forces in the rotating frame. The inertial forces would include the centrifugal force due to the rotation of the frame about the z-axis. \n\nAlternatively, in the inertial frame, we can consider the real forces (gravity) and the inertial forces (centrifugal, Coriolis, etc.) due to the motion. However, since the motion is steady and there's no acceleration in the direction of motion, maybe the Coriolis force is zero? Wait, no, the Coriolis force depends on the velocity of the mass elements. \n\nBut since we are looking for a steady-state equilibrium, perhaps we can use D'Alembert's principle by considering the virtual work done by the inertial forces and the real forces. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a statics problem by introducing the centrifugal force as an effective force. \n\nLet me try that approach. \n\nIn the rotating frame that rotates with angular velocity ω about the z-axis, each mass element dm experiences a centrifugal force outward from the axis of rotation (the z-axis). The magnitude of this centrifugal force is dm * ω² * r, where r is the distance from dm to the z-axis. \n\nIn addition, there is gravity acting on dm, which is dm * g downward. \n\nSince in the rotating frame, the rod is in static equilibrium (steady rotation), we can apply the conditions for static equilibrium: the sum of forces is zero, and the sum of torques is zero. \n\nBut since the rod is free to rotate about the horizontal axis through O, the only constraint is that there is no torque about the axis of rotation (the horizontal axis through O). Therefore, perhaps we can take torques about point O and set them to zero. \n\nSo, the idea is to calculate the torque due to gravity and the torque due to the centrifugal force about point O, and set their sum to zero. \n\nLet me proceed with this. \n\nFirst, let me find the torque due to gravity. Since the rod is uniform, the center of mass is at its midpoint. As earlier, the center of mass is located at a distance of (b - a)/2 from point O along the rod? Wait, earlier I thought of the rod as having OA = a and OB = b, so total length a + b. The midpoint is at (a + b)/2 from point A, which is a distance of (a + b)/2 - a = (b - a)/2 from point O. However, if a ≠ b, then the center of mass is not at O. \n\nTherefore, the center of mass is located at distance d = (b - a)/2 from O along the rod. However, depending on whether a > b or b > a, it could be on either side. \n\nBut since the rod is making an angle α with the vertical, the position vector of the center of mass relative to O is along the rod at distance d from O. Therefore, the gravitational force acts downward, and the torque due to gravity about O is the cross product of the position vector of the center of mass and the gravitational force. \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nThe gravitational force on the rod is mg downward, where m is the total mass. The position vector of the center of mass relative to O is a vector of length d along the rod. Since the rod makes an angle α with the vertical, the horizontal component of this position vector is d * sin α, and the vertical component is d * cos α. \n\nBut torque about O is r × F. Since gravity acts downward, the torque due to gravity will tend to rotate the rod. Let me think about the direction. If the center of mass is located at distance d from O along the rod, then if d is positive (i.e., center of mass is on the side of B, if b > a), then depending on the angle α, the torque would be... \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the torque as mg * lever arm. The lever arm for gravity about O is the horizontal distance from O to the line of action of gravity. Since gravity acts downward, the lever arm is the horizontal component of the position vector of the center of mass. \n\nTherefore, torque due to gravity, τ_gravity = mg * d * sin α. \n\nWait, if the center of mass is at distance d from O along the rod, which is at angle α from the vertical, then the horizontal distance from O to the center of mass is d * sin α. Therefore, the torque due to gravity about O is mg * d * sin α. \n\nBut the direction of this torque depends on whether d is positive or negative. If d is positive (i.e., center of mass is on one side of O), then the torque will tend to rotate the rod in a certain direction. \n\nNow, the centrifugal force. Each mass element dm experiences a centrifugal force radially outward from the axis of rotation (the z-axis). The torque due to centrifugal force about O will depend on the position of dm relative to O and the direction of the centrifugal force. \n\nTo compute the total torque due to centrifugal force, I need to integrate over the entire rod. \n\nLet me parametrize the rod. Let me consider a coordinate s along the rod from point O, where s ranges from -a to +b. For each position s along the rod, the mass element dm is λ ds, where λ = m / (a + b) is the mass per unit length. \n\nThe position of dm relative to O is along the rod, at distance |s| from O. However, the direction depends on s. But since the rod is at angle α with the vertical, the coordinates of dm in space can be determined. \n\nLet me define a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical. The rod is at angle α from the z-axis. Let me define the position vector of dm relative to O. Since the rod is rotating about the horizontal axis, which itself is rotating about the z-axis. However, in the steady state, the rod is fixed in the rotating frame, so we can consider the position vector in the rotating frame. \n\nAlternatively, since we are considering centrifugal force, which depends on the distance from the z-axis, let me find the distance r from dm to the z-axis. \n\nLet me imagine that the rod is in a plane that is rotating about the z-axis with angular velocity ω. The rod makes an angle α with the vertical. Let me consider a dm located at distance s from O along the rod. The coordinates of dm can be found by decomposing the position vector into components. \n\nSince the rod is at angle α from the vertical, the position vector of dm relative to O has a vertical component and a horizontal component. The vertical component is s * cos α, and the horizontal component is s * sin α. However, the horizontal component is in the plane of rotation. \n\nBut the distance from dm to the z-axis (the axis of rotation for the centrifugal force) is equal to the magnitude of the horizontal component of the position vector. Therefore, r = s * sin α. \n\nTherefore, the centrifugal force on dm is dm * ω² * r = dm * ω² * s * sin α. \n\nNow, the direction of the centrifugal force is radially outward from the z-axis. However, since the dm is located at a position with horizontal component s * sin α, the direction of the centrifugal force is along the horizontal plane, radially outward from the z-axis. \n\nTherefore, the centrifugal force vector for dm is directed horizontally away from the z-axis. \n\nTo compute the torque due to this centrifugal force about point O, I need to take the cross product of the position vector of dm relative to O and the centrifugal force vector. \n\nLet me denote the position vector of dm relative to O as **r**. The centrifugal force is **F**_centrifugal = dm * ω² * **r**_horizontal, where **r**_horizontal is the horizontal component of **r**. \n\nBut since torque is **τ** = **r** × **F**, we need to compute this cross product. \n\nLet me decompose **r** into vertical and horizontal components: **r** = **r**_vertical + **r**_horizontal. However, since the centrifugal force is purely horizontal (radially outward), the cross product **r** × **F**_centrifugal will involve the vertical component of **r** crossed with the horizontal **F**_centrifugal. \n\nSpecifically, the horizontal component of **r** is parallel to **F**_centrifugal, so their cross product is zero. The vertical component of **r** crossed with **F**_centrifugal will give a torque. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let me define coordinates:\n\nLet me take O as the origin. The z-axis is vertical. The rod makes an angle α with the z-axis. Let me define the horizontal plane as x-y. Let me assume that the horizontal component of the rod (i.e., the projection onto the horizontal plane) is in the x-direction. Therefore, the position vector of dm relative to O is:\n\n**r** = (s * sin α, 0, s * cos α)\n\nWait, if the rod is at angle α from the vertical, then the position vector of dm at distance s from O along the rod is:\n\n- Vertical component: s * cos α (along z-axis)\n- Horizontal component: s * sin α (along some direction in the horizontal plane)\n\nSince the rod is rotating about the horizontal axis, which is itself rotating about the z-axis, but in steady motion, the orientation of the horizontal axis is rotating, but the rod remains at angle α. However, for torque calculations, the direction of the horizontal component might not matter because torque is a cross product. \n\nBut since the centrifugal force is directed radially outward from the z-axis, which for a position vector **r** = (x, y, z), the direction of the centrifugal force is along (x, y, 0). Therefore, for our case, the horizontal component of **r** is (s * sin α, 0, 0) if we align the rod's horizontal projection along the x-axis. Wait, but actually, if the rod is in a plane that is rotating, the horizontal component direction is changing, but in the rotating frame, it's fixed. \n\nBut since we are considering the torque in the rotating frame, we can fix the coordinate system such that the horizontal component of the rod is along the x-axis. Therefore, the position vector of dm is:\n\n**r** = (s * sin α, 0, s * cos α)\n\nTherefore, the centrifugal force on dm is:\n\n**F**_centrifugal = dm * ω² * (s * sin α, 0, 0)\n\nTherefore, the torque about O is:\n\n**τ** = **r** × **F**_centrifugal = |i        j          k|\n                                 |s sin α  0    s cos α|\n                                 |ω² s sin α 0        0 |\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\ni component: (0 * 0 - s cos α * 0) = 0\n\nj component: -(s sin α * 0 - s cos α * ω² s sin α) = -[0 - s cos α * ω² s sin α] = s² cos α sin α ω²\n\nk component: (s sin α * 0 - 0 * ω² s sin α) = 0\n\nWait, cross product formula:\n\nIf **a** = (a_x, a_y, a_z) and **b** = (b_x, b_y, b_z), then **a** × **b** = (a_y b_z - a_z b_y, a_z b_x - a_x b_z, a_x b_y - a_y b_x)\n\nTherefore, for **r** = (s sin α, 0, s cos α) and **F**_centrifugal = (dm ω² s sin α, 0, 0), the cross product is:\n\n( (0 * 0 - s cos α * 0), (s cos α * dm ω² s sin α - s sin α * 0), (s sin α * 0 - 0 * dm ω² s sin α) )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(0, dm ω² s² cos α sin α, 0)\n\nTherefore, the torque due to the centrifugal force on dm is in the y-direction with magnitude dm ω² s² cos α sin α. \n\nBut since we are considering torque about O, and the rod is free to rotate about the horizontal axis, which I assumed was along the x-axis in this coordinate system. Therefore, the torque that would cause rotation about the horizontal axis (x-axis) is the component of torque along the axis perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, actually, torque causing rotation about the horizontal axis would be the component of torque about that axis. \n\nWait, in our coordinate system, the horizontal axis (about which the rod can rotate) is the x-axis. The torque that would cause rotation about the x-axis is the component of the torque along the x-axis. However, the torque we just calculated is along the y-axis. \n\nWait, maybe I need to think more carefully. \n\nThe rod is free to rotate about the horizontal axis through O. Let's say this horizontal axis is the x-axis in our coordinate system. Therefore, any torque about the x-axis will cause rotation of the rod. However, the torque due to centrifugal force we calculated is along the y-axis. Therefore, does that contribute to rotation about the x-axis? \n\nNo, torque about the x-axis would be the component of torque along the x-axis. The torque from centrifugal force is along y-axis, which is perpendicular to the x-axis. Therefore, maybe I need to find the component of the total torque about the x-axis. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to take the torque about the axis of rotation (the x-axis). \n\nTo compute the torque about the x-axis, we can use the formula for torque about an axis, which is the component of the torque vector along that axis. \n\nIn our case, the torque due to centrifugal force on dm is along the y-axis, so its component along the x-axis is zero. Therefore, does that mean that the centrifugal force does not produce a torque about the x-axis? \n\nBut that seems odd. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate system. Let me try to visualize again. \n\nIf the rod is in a plane that contains the z-axis and makes angle α with the vertical (z-axis), then the rod lies in the x-z plane (if we align it that way). The horizontal axis about which the rod can rotate is the x-axis. The centrifugal force on each dm is directed radially outward from the z-axis, which in the x-z plane would be along the x-direction (since the horizontal component is along x). Therefore, the centrifugal force is along x-axis. \n\nThe position vector of dm is in the x-z plane. The torque about O is **r** × **F**. Since **F** is along x-axis and **r** is in x-z plane, the cross product will be in the direction perpendicular to both, which is the y-direction. Therefore, torque is along y-axis. \n\nBut the rod is free to rotate about the x-axis. Therefore, the torque about the x-axis is zero? Wait, no. The torque about the x-axis is calculated by projecting the torque vector onto the x-axis. However, since the torque vector is along the y-axis, its component along the x-axis is zero. Therefore, the centrifugal force does not produce a torque about the x-axis? That seems contradictory. \n\nBut intuitively, the centrifugal force should produce a torque that tends to rotate the rod. If the rod is tilted at angle α, the centrifugal force would push the rod outward, trying to make it more horizontal. Therefore, there must be a torque about the x-axis. \n\nWhere is the mistake here? \n\nAh! Perhaps my coordinate system is not appropriate. Let me think again. \n\nIf the rod is free to rotate about the horizontal axis, which we can take as the x-axis, and the centrifugal force is directed radially outward from the z-axis, then for each dm on the rod, the centrifugal force is in the horizontal plane (perpendicular to z-axis). However, the direction of the centrifugal force depends on the position of dm. \n\nFor example, consider a dm located on one side of the rod (say, on the side away from the z-axis), the centrifugal force would push it outward, creating a torque about the x-axis. Similarly, for dm on the other side, it would also push outward, but depending on the position, the torque could be in the same or opposite direction. \n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, we considered the entire rod lying in the x-z plane. Therefore, all dm's are in the x-z plane. The centrifugal force on each dm is in the x-direction (since their horizontal component is along x). Therefore, the position vector **r** of dm is (x, 0, z), and the centrifugal force is (F, 0, 0). The torque **r** × **F** is (0, F z, 0). Therefore, torque is along y-axis. \n\nBut torque about the x-axis is calculated by taking the component of the torque vector along the x-axis, which is zero. Therefore, according to this, the centrifugal force does not produce a torque about the x-axis. But this contradicts intuition. \n\nWait, maybe I need to use another approach. Instead of calculating the vector torque, maybe I should calculate the torque about the x-axis directly. \n\nThe torque about the x-axis due to a force **F** acting at position **r** is given by the projection of **r** × **F** onto the x-axis. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute it using the formula:\n\nτ_x = y F_z - z F_y\n\nBut since in our case, **F** is along x-axis, F_y = F_z = 0. Therefore, τ_x = y*0 - z*0 = 0. \n\nWait, that suggests that the torque about the x-axis is zero. But this seems wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use another method. Let's think about the physical situation. \n\nIf the rod is tilted at angle α from the vertical, then parts of the rod are at different distances from the z-axis. The centrifugal force tends to push the parts of the rod further from the z-axis outward. If the rod is tilted, then the parts of the rod that are further from the z-axis are those that are on the side opposite to the tilt. \n\nFor example, imagine α = 0, the rod is vertical. All points on the rod are along the z-axis, so centrifugal force is zero, so no torque. If α approaches 90 degrees, the rod is horizontal. Then, each dm is at distance s sin α = s from the z-axis (since sin 90 = 1). The centrifugal force is outward, so for each dm, the force is along the horizontal direction (same as the rod). However, since the rod is horizontal, the centrifugal force is along the rod. Therefore, the torque about O due to centrifugal force would be zero because the force is directed along the rod (so the line of action passes through O). \n\nWait, if the rod is horizontal (α = 90°), then centrifugal force is along the rod, so no torque about O. But if the rod is at some angle α between 0 and 90, then the centrifugal force is horizontal but not along the rod. Therefore, there should be a torque. \n\nBut according to the previous calculation, the torque is along y-axis. Maybe I need to consider that the axis of rotation is the x-axis, so to find the torque about the x-axis, we need to use the component of the position vector and force perpendicular to the x-axis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the formula for torque about a line (the x-axis). \n\nThe torque about the x-axis due to a force **F** acting at position **r** is equal to the integral over the rod of ( **r** × **F** ) ⋅ **e_x**, where **e_x** is the unit vector along the x-axis. \n\nBut since **r** × **F** is along y-axis, and **e_x** is along x-axis, their dot product is zero. Therefore, torque about x-axis is zero. \n\nThis is confusing because physically, there should be a torque. Where is the mistake? \n\nWait, maybe my assumption about the direction of the centrifugal force is wrong. Let me think again. \n\nIf the rod is at angle α from the vertical, and the entire system is rotating about the z-axis with angular velocity ω, then each dm experiences a centrifugal force directed radially outward from the z-axis. \n\nHowever, the position of dm relative to the z-axis is not along the rod. For example, take dm at some position along the rod. Its distance from the z-axis is r = s sin α, where s is the distance from O along the rod. The direction of the centrifugal force is radial from the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the z-axis. Therefore, if the rod is tilted at angle α, then the centrifugal force direction is perpendicular to the z-axis and depends on the position of dm. \n\nBut if I take the rod in the x-z plane, then the centrifugal force for each dm is along the x-axis. However, the position vector of dm is in the x-z plane. Therefore, the torque about O is in the y-direction, which is perpendicular to the x-axis. Therefore, there is no torque about the x-axis. \n\nBut this suggests that the centrifugal force does not produce any torque about the x-axis, which seems wrong. \n\nWait, but if there is no torque about the x-axis, then the only torque is due to gravity. Therefore, the system would just hang under gravity. But since the rod is rotating, there must be some balance between gravity and centrifugal force. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider another component of the motion. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the rod is rotating about the horizontal axis. But in steady motion, the angular velocity about the horizontal axis is zero? Or is there another angular velocity? \n\nWait, the problem states that the horizontal axis rotates at angular velocity ω around the vertical axis. The rod can rotate freely about the horizontal axis. In steady rotation, the rod is not rotating about the horizontal axis, so its angular velocity about the horizontal axis is zero. Therefore, the only motion is the rotation of the horizontal axis about the vertical axis. \n\nTherefore, each dm is moving in a circle about the vertical axis with angular velocity ω. Therefore, the velocity of dm is tangential to that circle, and the acceleration is centripetal towards the z-axis. \n\nIn D'Alembert's principle, we can consider the inertial force, which is the negative of the mass times acceleration, i.e., -m * a. In this case, the acceleration is centripetal, so the inertial force is centrifugal force outward. \n\nBut if there is no torque about the x-axis, then how is the system in equilibrium? \n\nWait, maybe my mistake is in assuming that the only real force is gravity. There is also the reaction force at the pivot O. However, since we are taking torques about O, the reaction forces at O do not contribute to the torque. \n\nTherefore, if the torque due to gravity is balanced by the torque due to centrifugal force about O, but according to previous calculations, the torque due to centrifugal force about O is along y-axis, which doesn't affect the rotation about x-axis. \n\nThis suggests that there is no torque about the x-axis from centrifugal force, which would mean that the only torque is from gravity, which would mean the rod would just hang vertically. But that can't be right, since if the rod is rotating, there should be some angle α ≠ 0. \n\nTherefore, there must be an error in my reasoning. \n\nLet me try another approach. Let me consider the potential energy of the system in the rotating frame. In the rotating frame, we have an effective potential due to centrifugal force. The rod will settle into a position where the effective potential is minimized. \n\nThe effective potential is the gravitational potential plus the centrifugal potential. \n\nThe gravitational potential energy is U_gravity = -mg * height of center of mass. \n\nThe centrifugal potential energy is U_centrifugal = -∫ (½ ω² r²) dm, where r is the distance from the z-axis. \n\nTherefore, total effective potential energy is U = U_gravity + U_centrifugal. \n\nSetting derivative of U with respect to α to zero will give the equilibrium angle. \n\nLet me try this. \n\nFirst, compute U_gravity. The height of the center of mass relative to some reference point (let's take O as reference). The center of mass is at distance d = (b - a)/2 from O along the rod. Therefore, its height is d * cos α. Assuming downward is negative, but since potential energy is -mg * height if we take upward as positive. Wait, standard gravitational potential energy is U = mgh, where h is height above a reference point. If we take O as the reference, then the height of the center of mass is z = d * cos α. Therefore, U_gravity = mg * z = mg d cos α. \n\nNow, the centrifugal potential energy. The centrifugal potential is analogous to a potential energy associated with the centrifugal force. Since centrifugal force is conservative, we can define a potential such that F = -∇U. The centrifugal acceleration is ω² r radially outward, so the centrifugal force is dm ω² r outward. Therefore, the potential energy associated with this is U_centrifugal = -∫ (½ ω² r²) dm. Wait, actually, the potential energy corresponding to a force F(r) = k r is U = -½ k r². Therefore, yes, if the centrifugal force is dm ω² r, then the potential is -½ ω² r² dm. \n\nTherefore, total centrifugal potential energy is U_centrifugal = -½ ω² ∫ r² dm, where r is the distance from the z-axis. \n\nAs before, for a dm located at distance s from O along the rod, r = s sin α. Therefore, \n\nU_centrifugal = -½ ω² ∫ (s sin α)^2 dm = -½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm \n\nTherefore, total effective potential energy is:\n\nU = mg d cos α - ½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm \n\nTo find the equilibrium angle α, we take derivative of U with respect to α, set it to zero:\n\ndU/dα = -mg d sin α - ½ ω² [ 2 sin α cos α ∫ s² dm ] = 0 \n\nSimplify:\n\n- mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 \n\nFactor out sin α:\n\nsin α [ -mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm ] = 0 \n\nSolutions are sin α = 0 (α = 0 or π) or the term in brackets equals zero. \n\nAssuming α is not 0 or π (since α=0 would mean rod is vertical, but we need to check if it's stable), we set:\n\n- mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 \n\nSolving for α:\n\nmg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 \n\nWait, but this gives cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nHowever, cos α must be between -1 and 1. Depending on the sign of d. \n\nRecall that d = (b - a)/2. Therefore, if b > a, d is positive, so cos α would be negative, implying α > 90°, which might not make sense since the rod is rotating about a horizontal axis. Wait, maybe my coordinate system is flipped. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the signs in the potential energy. Let me check. \n\nThe centrifugal force is outward, so the potential energy should decrease as r increases. Therefore, the potential energy is negative of the work done by centrifugal force. Wait, the centrifugal force does positive work when moving outward, so the potential energy should be negative of that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as adding the centrifugal \"potential\" which is like a potential energy that increases with r². Wait, if the centrifugal force is like a spring force pushing outward, then the potential energy would be positive? No, if you have a force F = k r outward, then the potential energy is -½ k r² because the force is conservative and F = -dU/dr => U = -½ k r². \n\nBut in our case, the centrifugal force is dm ω² r outward, so k = ω². Therefore, the potential energy is -½ ω² r² dm. Therefore, integrating gives U_centrifugal = -½ ω² ∫ r² dm. \n\nTherefore, the total potential energy is U = mg d cos α - ½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm. \n\nTaking derivative with respect to α:\n\ndU/dα = -mg d sin α - ½ ω² [ 2 sin α cos α ∫ s² dm ] \n\n= -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm \n\nSetting equal to zero:\n\n- sin α [ mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm ] = 0 \n\nTherefore, either sin α = 0 or mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 \n\nAssuming sin α ≠ 0, then:\n\ncos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nNow, let's compute ∫ s² dm. \n\nSince dm = λ ds, where λ = m / (a + b), and s ranges from -a to +b. \n\nTherefore, ∫ s² dm = λ ∫_{-a}^{b} s² ds \n\nCompute the integral:\n\n∫_{-a}^{b} s² ds = [ (s³)/3 ] from -a to b = (b³/3 - (-a)³/3) = (b³ + a³)/3 \n\nTherefore,\n\n∫ s² dm = λ * (a³ + b³)/3 = [ m / (a + b) ] * (a³ + b³)/3 \n\nSimplify a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²). Therefore,\n\n∫ s² dm = [ m / (a + b) ] * (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)/3 = m (a² - ab + b²)/3 \n\nTherefore, ∫ s² dm = (m / 3)(a² - ab + b²) \n\nNow, recall that d = (b - a)/2. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\ncos α = - [ mg * (b - a)/2 ] / [ ω² * (m / 3)(a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nSimplify:\n\ncos α = - [ (b - a)/2 * g ] / [ (ω² / 3)(a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 3:\n\ncos α = - [ 3g (b - a)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNote that a² - ab + b² is symmetric in a and b if we consider the sign. Also, note that (b - a) is -(a - b). Therefore:\n\ncos α = - [ 3g (b - a)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\n= [ 3g (a - b)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nAlternatively, factor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\ncos α = [ 3g (a - b)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nBut cos α must be between -1 and 1. Depending on whether a > b or b > a, the numerator changes sign. \n\nLet me assume that a ≠ b. If a = b, then d = 0 and cos α = 0, implying α = π/2. But if a = b, the rod is symmetric about O, so when rotating, the centrifugal forces on both sides balance, and the rod remains horizontal? Wait, if a = b, then d = 0, so the center of mass is at O. Therefore, torque due to gravity is zero. Then, the potential energy is only due to centrifugal force. The derivative would be - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm = 0, leading to sin α = 0 or cos α = 0. Therefore, α = 0 or π/2. But α = 0 would mean rod is vertical, but since there's no torque, it could be in equilibrium at any angle? Wait, no, if there's no torque, then any angle is equilibrium. But in reality, the potential energy would be U = -½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm. This is minimized when sin² α is maximized, i.e., α = π/2. Therefore, the stable equilibrium is at α = π/2. So when a = b, the rod is horizontal. \n\nTherefore, returning to general case. \n\nIf a > b, then (a - b) is positive, so cos α is positive? Wait, cos α equals [ 3g (a - b)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nWait, if a > b, then numerator is positive, so cos α is positive. Therefore, α is acute (between 0 and π/2). If b > a, then numerator is negative, so cos α is negative, meaning α is obtuse (between π/2 and π). But since the rod is rotating about a horizontal axis, α is measured from the vertical, so it's between 0 and π. \n\nHowever, physically, if b > a, meaning OB is longer than OA, then the center of mass is on the OB side, so the rod would tend to hang towards OB. But with rotation, the centrifugal force would try to push it outward. \n\nBut according to the formula, if b > a, then cos α is negative, so α > π/2, meaning the rod tilts towards the longer side? Wait, if α is the angle with the vertical, and if α > π/2, then the rod is tilting away from the vertical on the side of B. \n\nBut let's not get bogged down with physical intuition. Let's just keep the formula. \n\nSo, the angle α is given by:\n\ncos α = [ 3g (a - b)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nBut this can be written as:\n\ncos α = [ 3g (a - b) ] / [ 2 ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nHowever, note that if we want α to be the angle from the vertical towards the side where the center of mass is, depending on whether a or b is larger. \n\nBut the problem says \"the angle α that the rod AB forms with the vertical axis during steady rotation\". So the answer is given by:\n\nα = arccos [ 3g (a - b) / (2 ω² (a² - ab + b²)) ) ]\n\nBut we need to make sure that the argument of arccos is within [-1, 1]. \n\nBut let's check dimensions. The numerator has dimensions of [g] * [length], denominator has [ω²] * [length²], so overall dimensionless, which is correct. \n\nHowever, there might be a sign error. Let me check the derivation again. \n\nEarlier, when I derived cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nWith d = (b - a)/2, so:\n\ncos α = - mg (b - a)/2 / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nBut ∫ s² dm was found to be (m / 3)(a² - ab + b²). Therefore,\n\ncos α = - [ mg (b - a)/2 ] / [ ω² (m / 3)(a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nThe mass m cancels:\n\ncos α = - [ g (b - a)/2 ] / [ ω² (1 / 3)(a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\n= - [ 3g (b - a)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\n= [ 3g (a - b)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ) ] \n\nYes, same as before. \n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. \n\nBut let me check with the case when a = b. If a = b, then numerator is zero, so cos α = 0 => α = π/2, which matches our previous conclusion. \n\nAnother check: suppose a >> b, so the rod is mostly on the A side. Then, (a - b) ≈ a, and denominator is a² - ab + b² ≈ a². Therefore, cos α ≈ [ 3g a / 2 ] / [ ω² a² ] = 3g / (2 ω² a). Therefore, if ω is large enough, cos α becomes small, meaning α approaches π/2. Wait, but if a >> b, and if we have a large ω, the centrifugal force would dominate, pushing the rod to be horizontal (α = π/2). However, according to this formula, cos α is positive, so α is acute. But if the rod is mostly on the A side (a >> b), and if centrifugal force is trying to make it horizontal, then the rod would tilt towards the A side? Or away? \n\nWait, if the rod is mostly on the A side (a >> b), then the center of mass is on the A side. Gravity would try to pull it down towards the A side, making α acute. However, centrifugal force, which depends on the square of the distance from the z-axis, would also act. For a dm on the A side (negative s), its distance from the z-axis is s sin α, but since s is negative, r = |s| sin α. The centrifugal force would push it outward, which for the A side (negative s), outward is towards more negative x (assuming rod in x-z plane). However, since the rod is free to rotate about the x-axis, the torque from centrifugal force would depend on how the force is applied. \n\nBut according to our potential energy approach, the angle α is determined by the balance between gravity and centrifugal potential. In the case where a >> b and ω is large, the centrifugal term dominates, so cos α ≈ 3g/(2 ω² a). If ω is very large, cos α approaches zero, so α approaches π/2, meaning the rod is horizontal. Which makes sense because centrifugal force would dominate and make the rod horizontal. \n\nIf ω is small, then cos α is positive but larger, so α is acute, meaning the rod tilts towards the A side due to gravity. \n\nTherefore, the formula seems to make sense. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nα = arccos [ 3g (a - b) / (2 ω² (a² - ab + b²)) ) ]\n\nBut let me write it in a more symmetric way. Note that a² - ab + b² = (a^2 + b^2) - ab. Also, the numerator is 3g(a - b). \n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\ncos α = [ 3g (a - b) ] / [ 2 ω² (a² - ab + b²) ]\n\nBut maybe we can write it as:\n\ncos α = [ 3g (a - b) ] / [ 2 ω² (a² + b² - ab) ]\n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, this is the angle α. \n\nBut let me check the signs again. If a < b, then (a - b) is negative, so cos α is negative, implying α > π/2. Which would mean the rod tilts towards the B side, which has longer length, hence center of mass is there. So gravity would pull it down towards B, making α obtuse. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nTherefore, this formula seems correct. \n\nBut let me check with D'Alembert's principle again, to ensure consistency. \n\nEarlier, when I tried to compute torque, I found that torque due to centrifugal force is along y-axis, which didn't contribute to rotation about x-axis. But with potential energy approach, I got an answer. Maybe the potential energy approach is correct, and my torque analysis was flawed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider another component. \n\nLet me try to redo the torque calculation properly. \n\nThe problem is that in the coordinate system where the rod lies in x-z plane, the torque due to centrifugal force is along y-axis. However, the rod is free to rotate about x-axis. How does this torque affect the equilibrium? \n\nActually, if there is a torque about y-axis, but the rod is constrained to rotate only about x-axis, then maybe we need to consider the constraint forces. However, since we are taking torques about O, and the constraint forces at O do not contribute to the torque, then if there is a net torque about y-axis, the rod would start rotating about y-axis, which it cannot do because it's constrained to rotate about x-axis. Therefore, in reality, the only way for the rod to be in equilibrium is if the net torque about all axes is zero. However, since it can only rotate about x-axis, maybe the torque about y-axis is balanced by something else? \n\nThis suggests that my potential energy approach might have an error, because if there is a net torque about y-axis, the system cannot be in equilibrium. \n\nBut according to the potential energy approach, there is an equilibrium angle α. \n\nThis contradiction suggests a mistake in one of the approaches. \n\nLet me think again. In the potential energy approach, I assumed that the effective potential is the sum of gravitational and centrifugal potential, and found the equilibrium by minimizing it. This is valid in a rotating frame, where the only forces are gravity and centrifugal force (assuming no other forces like Coriolis, which do not contribute to potential energy). However, in reality, there are constraint forces at O, which do not do work (since the pivot is fixed), so they don't contribute to the potential energy. Therefore, the potential energy approach should be valid. \n\nTherefore, the fact that there is a torque about y-axis in that coordinate system must be balanced by something? Or maybe in the rotating frame, even though there is a torque about y-axis, the rod is not free to rotate about y-axis, so it remains in place? \n\nThis is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to trust the potential energy approach since it gave a physically reasonable answer and passed the checks. \n\nTherefore, proceeding with the result:\n\ncos α = [ 3g (a - b) ] / [ 2 ω² (a² + b² - ab) ]\n\nBut let me write it as:\n\ncos α = [ 3g (a - b) ] / [ 2 ω² (a² + b² - ab) ]\n\nAlternatively, factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNote that a² + b² - ab = ½[(a - b)^2 + a² + b²]? No, let me compute:\n\n(a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b², so a² + b² - ab = (a² - 2ab + b²) + ab = (a - b)^2 + ab. Not sure if helpful. \n\nAlternatively, leave it as is. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is α = arccos [ 3g(a - b) / (2ω²(a² + b² - ab)) ]\n\nBut let me check units again. \n\nNumerator: g is m/s², (a - b) is meters, so numerator is m²/s².\n\nDenominator: ω² is 1/s², and (a² + b² - ab) is m², so denominator is m²/s². Therefore, overall dimensionless, correct. \n\nTherefore, the formula is dimensionally consistent. \n\nTherefore, unless there is a miscalculation in the integral or elsewhere, this should be correct. \n\nLet me check the integral ∫ s² dm again. \n\nWe had:\n\n∫_{-a}^{b} s² dm, with dm = λ ds, λ = m/(a + b). \n\nTherefore:\n\n∫_{-a}^b s² λ ds = λ [s³/3]_{-a}^b = λ [ b³/3 - (-a)³/3 ] = λ [ (b³ + a³)/3 ] \n\nAnd since λ = m/(a + b), then:\n\nm/(a + b) * (a³ + b³)/3 = m(a³ + b³)/(3(a + b)) \n\nAnd since a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²), then:\n\nm(a + b)(a² - ab + b²)/(3(a + b)) ) = m(a² - ab + b²)/3 \n\nYes, correct. \n\nTherefore, the integral was computed correctly. \n\nTherefore, the final expression for cos α is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is α = arccos [ 3g(a - b) / (2ω²(a² + b² - ab)) ]\n\nBut let me write it in terms of OA = a and OB = b as given in the problem. \n\nYes, since OA = a and OB = b, this expression is correct. \n\nTherefore, the angle α is given by:\n\nα = arccos [ 3g(a - b) / (2ω²(a² + b² - ab)) ]\n\nBut let me check if there is a simpler way to write the denominator. Note that a² + b² - ab can be written as (a^2 + b^2 - ab). \n\nAlternatively, maybe factor it as something else, but I don't think so. \n\nTherefore, this is the final expression. \n\nBut let me check with another approach using D'Alembert's principle directly, to see if I get the same result. \n\nD'Alembert's principle states that the virtual work of the applied forces plus the virtual work of the inertial forces equals zero for any virtual displacement. \n\nIn this case, the virtual displacement would be a small rotation of the rod about the horizontal axis, changing the angle α. \n\nLet me consider a virtual displacement δα. The virtual work done by gravity is the gravitational force times the virtual displacement of the center of mass. The virtual work done by the inertial forces (centrifugal force) is the centrifugal forces times their virtual displacements. \n\nThe total virtual work should be zero. \n\nLet me calculate this. \n\nFirst, virtual work done by gravity: \n\nWhen the rod rotates by δα, the center of mass moves. The vertical component of the center of mass changes by δz = -d sin α δα (since z = d cos α, so dz/dα = -d sin α). Therefore, the virtual work done by gravity is F_gravity * δz = mg * (-d sin α δα) \n\nNow, virtual work done by centrifugal forces: \n\nFor each dm, the centrifugal force is dm ω² r, where r = s sin α. The virtual displacement due to δα is the displacement of dm caused by rotating the rod by δα. \n\nTo find this, we need to find the displacement of dm when the rod rotates by δα about the horizontal axis. \n\nThe rotation of the rod by δα changes the angle α. The displacement of dm is tangential to the circular path caused by this rotation. \n\nThe magnitude of the displacement is approximately the arc length: s δα, where s is the distance from O to dm along the rod. However, the direction of this displacement is perpendicular to the rod. \n\nThe work done by the centrifugal force is the component of the centrifugal force in the direction of the displacement. \n\nTo compute this, we need to find the dot product between the centrifugal force and the virtual displacement vector. \n\nLet me consider the direction of the centrifugal force and the virtual displacement. \n\nThe centrifugal force is directed radially outward from the z-axis. The virtual displacement is due to rotation of the rod about the horizontal axis (x-axis in our previous coordinate system). \n\nLet me use the same coordinate system as before, with rod in x-z plane, angle α with vertical. \n\nA small rotation δα about the x-axis will change the orientation of the rod. For each dm, its position vector **r** = (s sin α, 0, s cos α). After rotation by δα, the new position vector is approximately **r** + δ**r**, where δ**r** is the virtual displacement. \n\nThe virtual displacement δ**r** due to rotation about x-axis by δα is given by δ**r** = δα × **r**, where δα is the axial vector of the rotation. Since it's a rotation about x-axis by δα, the axial vector is (δα, 0, 0). Therefore, \n\nδ**r** = (δα × **r**) = δα * (0, r_z, -r_y) \n\nBut in our case, **r** = (s sin α, 0, s cos α), so r_z = s cos α, r_y = 0. Therefore, \n\nδ**r** = δα * (0, s cos α, 0) \n\nTherefore, the virtual displacement is in the y-direction with magnitude δα * s cos α. \n\nThe centrifugal force on dm is **F**_centrifugal = dm ω² r **e_r**, where **e_r** is the radial unit vector in the horizontal plane. Since the rod is in the x-z plane, **e_r** is along x-axis. Therefore, **F**_centrifugal = dm ω² (s sin α, 0, 0) \n\nTherefore, the work done by centrifugal force is **F**_centrifugal ⋅ δ**r** = dm ω² s sin α * 0 + 0 + 0 = 0? \n\nWait, no. Wait, **F**_centrifugal is (dm ω² s sin α, 0, 0), and δ**r** is (0, δα s cos α, 0). Therefore, their dot product is zero. \n\nThis suggests that the virtual work done by centrifugal force is zero, which contradicts the potential energy approach. \n\nThis is a problem. According to D'Alembert's principle, the total virtual work should be zero. However, according to this, the virtual work done by gravity is -mg d sin α δα, and the virtual work done by centrifugal force is zero. Therefore, setting total virtual work to zero would imply -mg d sin α δα = 0, which implies α = 0 or π, which is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests a contradiction between the potential energy approach and the virtual work approach using D'Alembert's principle. \n\nWhere is the mistake? \n\nAh! In the virtual work approach, I have only considered the centrifugal force, but in reality, there are also other inertial forces in a rotating frame, such as the Coriolis force. However, D'Alembert's principle in an inertial frame does not include these. Wait, but I was trying to apply D'Alembert's principle in the inertial frame, considering the inertial forces (which in this case would be the centrifugal force if we consider the rotating frame). \n\nWait, no. D'Alembert's principle is typically applied in the inertial frame, where the inertial forces are the negative of the mass times acceleration. However, in this case, the acceleration of each dm is centripetal towards the z-axis. Therefore, the inertial force (for D'Alembert) would be centrifugal force outward. \n\nHowever, in the virtual work calculation, we found that the virtual work done by centrifugal force is zero, while the potential energy approach suggested otherwise. \n\nThis inconsistency needs to be resolved. \n\nLet me think. The potential energy approach was done in the rotating frame, where centrifugal force is considered as a pseudo-force, and the effective potential is used. The virtual work approach here is in the inertial frame, considering the inertial force (centrifugal). \n\nBut why is there a discrepancy? \n\nPossibly because in the inertial frame, the motion is more complex. The rod is rotating about the horizontal axis, which itself is rotating about the vertical axis. Therefore, the acceleration of each dm has two components: the centripetal acceleration due to the rotation about the vertical axis, and the centripetal acceleration due to rotation about the horizontal axis (if any). However, in steady motion, there is no rotation about the horizontal axis, so the only acceleration is due to the rotation about the vertical axis. \n\nHowever, in the inertial frame, the position of dm is changing both due to the rotation of the horizontal axis and the rotation of the rod about the horizontal axis. But in steady motion, the rod is not rotating about the horizontal axis, so its angular velocity about the horizontal axis is zero. Therefore, the only acceleration is the centripetal acceleration due to the rotation about the vertical axis. \n\nTherefore, the inertial force (centrifugal) is correctly accounted for in the virtual work calculation. But why does the virtual work give zero? \n\nBecause the virtual displacement is a rotation about the horizontal axis, and the centrifugal force is in the horizontal plane, while the virtual displacement is perpendicular to the horizontal plane (in the y-direction in our coordinate system). Therefore, their dot product is zero. \n\nThis suggests that there is no work done by the centrifugal force during a virtual rotation about the horizontal axis, which would mean that the only work is done by gravity, implying α = 0 or π. This contradicts the potential energy approach. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nLet me think about the potential energy approach again. In the rotating frame, we have centrifugal potential and gravitational potential. The virtual work approach in the rotating frame would involve both the real forces (gravity) and the centrifugal force. \n\nBut I did the virtual work in the inertial frame, considering only the inertial force (centrifugal). Maybe I should do it in the rotating frame. \n\nIn the rotating frame, the rod is in static equilibrium. Therefore, the virtual work done by all forces (gravity and centrifugal) should be zero. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nIn the rotating frame, the forces on the rod are gravity and centrifugal force. For a virtual displacement δα, the total virtual work should be zero. \n\nAs before, the virtual work done by gravity is -mg d sin α δα. \n\nWhat is the virtual work done by centrifugal force? \n\nIn the rotating frame, the centrifugal force is dm ω² r outward, and the virtual displacement is δ**r** as before. \n\nBut in the rotating frame, the virtual displacement δα is a rotation about the horizontal axis, which is fixed in the rotating frame. Therefore, the calculation of δ**r** is the same as before: (0, δα s cos α, 0). \n\nThe centrifugal force in the rotating frame is still dm ω² r in the radial direction (which is along x-axis in our coordinate system). Therefore, the dot product is still zero. \n\nThis suggests that in both frames, the virtual work done by centrifugal force is zero, leading to the same contradiction. \n\nThis implies that there is a mistake in the potential energy approach. \n\nBut how come the potential energy approach gave a reasonable answer? \n\nWait, maybe the potential energy approach is incorrect because it assumes that the centrifugal force can be derived from a potential, which is only true if the motion is such that the centrifugal force is conservative. In general, in rotating frames, the centrifugal force is conservative, while the Coriolis force is not. Therefore, the potential energy approach should be valid. \n\nBut why does the virtual work give zero? \n\nAh! The potential energy approach includes the centrifugal potential, which accounts for the work done by centrifugal force. However, in the virtual work calculation, I only considered the work done by the centrifugal force during the virtual displacement, which turned out to be zero. This suggests inconsistency. \n\nWait, let me recall that in the potential energy approach, the centrifugal potential is -½ ω² r² dm. Therefore, the virtual work done by centrifugal force should be the negative of the change in centrifugal potential. \n\nLet me calculate the change in centrifugal potential during the virtual displacement δα. \n\nThe centrifugal potential is U_centrifugal = -½ ω² ∫ r² dm \n\nWith r = s sin α, so U_centrifugal = -½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm \n\nThe change in U_centrifugal is δU_centrifugal = -ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα \n\nThe work done by centrifugal force is -δU_centrifugal = ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα \n\nSimilarly, the work done by gravity is -mg d sin α δα \n\nTotal virtual work is: \n\nW_total = -mg d sin α δα + ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα = 0 \n\nTherefore:\n\n[ -mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm ] sin α δα = 0 \n\nWhich gives the same condition as before: \n\n-mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 => cos α = mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nWait, but earlier in the potential energy approach, we had cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nWait, there is a sign discrepancy here. \n\nIn the potential energy approach, we had:\n\ndU/dα = -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 \n\nWhich led to:\n\n- mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 => cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nBut in the virtual work approach, we have:\n\n[ -mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm ] sin α δα = 0 => -mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 => cos α = mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nThe sign is opposite! \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nWhat is the source of this discrepancy? \n\nLet me check the potential energy calculation. \n\nThe potential energy was defined as U = U_gravity + U_centrifugal, with U_gravity = mg d cos α and U_centrifugal = -½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm \n\nThe derivative is dU/dα = -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm \n\nSetting to zero: -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 \n\nDividing by sin α: -mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 => cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nIn the virtual work approach, the total work is W_total = W_gravity + W_centrifugal = -mg d sin α δα + ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα = 0, leading to -mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 => cos α = mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nThe discrepancy is in the sign of the second term. \n\nThis suggests an error in one of the derivations. \n\nLet me check the virtual work calculation. \n\nThe work done by centrifugal force is -δU_centrifugal. \n\nU_centrifugal = -½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm \n\nTherefore, δU_centrifugal = dU_centrifugal/dα δα = -ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα \n\nTherefore, the work done by centrifugal force is -δU_centrifugal = ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα \n\nThis is correct. \n\nThe work done by gravity is -mg d sin α δα, as before. \n\nTherefore, total work: \n\nW_total = -mg d sin α δα + ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα = 0 \n\nWhich gives -mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 => cos α = mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nBut in the potential energy approach, we had cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nThis suggests a sign error in one of the potential energy terms. \n\nLet me revisit the potential energy derivation. \n\nThe centrifugal potential is defined such that the force is -∇U. The centrifugal force is F = dm ω² r in the radial direction. \n\nIf we take r as the distance from the axis, then the potential should satisfy F = -dU/dr => U = -½ ω² r² + const. \n\nTherefore, U_centrifugal = -½ ω² r² dm \n\nBut in our case, r = s sin α, so U_centrifugal = -½ ω² s² sin² α dm \n\nTherefore, total U_centrifugal = -½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm \n\nThis is correct. \n\nThen, the total potential energy is U = U_gravity + U_centrifugal = mg d cos α - ½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm \n\nTaking derivative with respect to α: \n\ndU/dα = -mg d sin α - ω² * 2 sin α cos α * ∫ s² dm / 2 = -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm \n\nYes, correct. \n\nSetting to zero: -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 => -mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0 => cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nBut in the virtual work approach, we have cos α = mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nThe difference is the sign. \n\nWhere is this coming from? \n\nLet me check the sign in the virtual work done by gravity. \n\nThe gravitational potential energy is U_gravity = mg d cos α. Therefore, the force due to gravity is -dU/dα = mg d sin α. But the work done by gravity for a positive δα (increasing α) is F_gravity * δz, where δz is the change in height. \n\nIf α increases, the rod tilts more from the vertical. If the center of mass is at d from O, then the height is z = d cos α. If α increases, cos α decreases, so z decreases, hence δz is negative. The work done by gravity is F_gravity * δz = mg * δz. Since δz is negative, the work is negative, which matches our calculation: -mg d sin α δα. \n\nBut in the virtual work equation, we have W_total = W_gravity + W_centrifugal = 0. \n\nIf the total work is zero, then the forces are in equilibrium. \n\nBut according to the potential energy approach, the condition is -mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0, while the virtual work gives -mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0. \n\nThis suggests that in one of the derivations, the sign of the centrifugal term is flipped. \n\nLet me check the virtual work calculation of the centrifugal term. \n\nWe said that the work done by centrifugal force is -δU_centrifugal. Since U_centrifugal = -½ ω² sin² α ∫ s² dm, then δU_centrifugal = -ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα. Therefore, the work done by centrifugal force is -δU_centrifugal = ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα. \n\nBut if the potential energy is U = U_gravity + U_centrifugal, then the total derivative is dU/dα = 0, which gives -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm = 0, which is the same as W_total = 0. \n\nWait, if dU/dα = 0, then -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm = 0, which can be written as ( -mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm ) sin α = 0. \n\nBut in the virtual work, we have W_total = ( -mg d + ω² cos α ∫ s² dm ) sin α δα = 0. \n\nThe difference is in the sign of the ω² term. \n\nThis suggests that there is a sign error in one of the derivations. \n\nLet me re-express the virtual work. \n\nThe total potential energy is U = U_gravity + U_centrifugal. The condition for equilibrium is dU/dα = 0, which gives the equation from the potential energy approach. \n\nBut the virtual work should also give the same condition. \n\nThe virtual work is δW = δU_gravity + δU_centrifugal = 0. \n\nWait, no! In the context of D'Alembert's principle, the virtual work of the applied forces (gravity) plus the virtual work of the inertial forces (centrifugal) should be zero. \n\nBut in the potential energy approach, the centrifugal potential is already included, so the virtual work should be δU = 0, which is the same as the potential energy approach. \n\nHowever, in our calculation, we have:\n\nδU = δU_gravity + δU_centrifugal = -mg d sin α δα - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα = 0 \n\nWhich is the same as the potential energy approach, leading to -mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0. \n\nBut in the earlier virtual work calculation, I said that W_total = W_gravity + W_centrifugal = -mg d sin α δα + ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα = 0, which is different. \n\nThe discrepancy is because in this last calculation, I incorrectly took W_centrifugal as +ω² ... while it should be -ω² ... to match δU_centrifugal. \n\nWait, let me clarify. \n\nThe work done by the centrifugal force should be equal to -δU_centrifugal, because the potential energy is defined such that the work done by the force is -δU. \n\nSince δU_centrifugal = -ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα, then the work done by the centrifugal force is -δU_centrifugal = ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα. \n\nHowever, the work done by gravity is -δU_gravity, since δU_gravity = -W_gravity. Wait, no: δU_gravity = W_gravity if the work is done against the force. \n\nActually, the relationship between work and potential energy is δU = -W, where W is the work done by the force. \n\nTherefore, W_gravity = -δU_gravity. \n\nSimilarly, W_centrifugal = -δU_centrifugal. \n\nTherefore, total work W_total = W_gravity + W_centrifugal = -δU_gravity - δU_centrifugal = -δ(U_gravity + U_centrifugal) = -δU = 0 \n\nTherefore, -δU = 0 => δU = 0, which is the condition from the potential energy approach. \n\nTherefore, in our case, δU = -mg d sin α δα - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm δα = 0, so W_total = -δU = 0. \n\nTherefore, the correct equation is -mg d sin α - ω² sin α cos α ∫ s² dm = 0, leading to -mg d - ω² cos α ∫ s² dm = 0, and hence cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nThis matches the potential energy approach. \n\nEarlier, in the virtual work calculation, I mistakenly wrote W_total = W_gravity + W_centrifugal = 0, but actually, it should be W_total = -δU = 0, which leads to the same equation. \n\nTherefore, the earlier mistake was in interpreting the sign in the virtual work calculation. \n\nTherefore, the correct condition is cos α = - mg d / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nWith d = (b - a)/2, this gives:\n\ncos α = - [ mg (b - a)/2 ] / [ ω² ∫ s² dm ] \n\nAs before, and with ∫ s² dm = m(a² - ab + b²)/3, this gives:\n\ncos α = - [ g (b - a)/2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²)/3 ] = - [ 3g (b - a) / 2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ] = [ 3g (a - b) / 2 ] / [ ω² (a² - ab + b²) ] \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nTherefore, this confirms that the potential energy approach was correct, and the earlier confusion in the virtual work was due to sign errors. \n\nTherefore, the final expression for α is:\n\nα = arccos [ 3g(a - b) / (2ω²(a² + b² - ab)) ]\n\nThis is the angle that the rod makes with the vertical during steady rotation. \n\nTo present it neatly, we can write:\n\ncos α = [3g(a - b)] / [2ω²(a² + b² - ab)]\n\nTherefore, the angle α is:\n\nα = cos⁻¹ [ 3g(a - b) / (2ω²(a² + b² - ab)) ]\n\nThis is the solution using D'Alembert's principle, as requested. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angle α is \\boxed{\\cos^{-1}\\left( \\dfrac{3g(a - b)}{2\\omega^2(a^2 + b^2 - ab)} \\right)}.\n</think>"}
