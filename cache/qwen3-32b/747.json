The problem gives me the radii of the fifth and fifteenth rings, which are 0.70 mm and 1.7 mm respectively. The wavelength of light is 0.63 micrometers. They also provided a formula: R equals (r_{k+m} squared minus r_k squared) divided by (m times lambda). \n\nFirst, let me recall what Newton's rings are. They are interference patterns caused by the reflection of light between a spherical surface and a flat surface. The rings are formed when the path difference between the two reflected light beams is an integer multiple of the wavelength. The formula given here is supposed to help calculate the radius of curvature R of the lens. \n\nThe formula is R = (r_{k+m}² - r_k²) / (mλ). Let me parse this. So, if I take two rings, one that is m rings apart from the other, then the difference in their radii squared divided by m times lambda gives me R. \n\nIn this case, they mention the fifth and fifteenth rings. Let me check: fifteenth ring minus fifth ring is 10 rings apart. So m would be 15 - 5 = 10. Let me confirm that. If k is the fifth ring, then k + m = 15, so m is 10. That makes sense. \n\nSo substituting the given values into the formula. Let me note down the given values:\n\nr_k (radius of fifth ring) = 0.70 mm\n\nr_{k+m} (radius of fifteenth ring) = 1.7 mm\n\nm = 10\n\nλ = 0.63 micrometers. \n\nBut before plugging in, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. The radii are given in millimeters, and the wavelength is in micrometers. Let me convert everything to meters or to the same unit. Let me choose meters.\n\nFirst, convert radii from mm to meters:\n\n0.70 mm = 0.70 × 10⁻³ meters = 7.0 × 10⁻⁴ m\n\n1.7 mm = 1.7 × 10⁻³ m\n\nWait, 1.7 mm is 1.7 × 10⁻³ m? Wait, 1 mm is 1 × 10⁻³ m, so 1.7 mm is 1.7 × 10⁻³ m. Yes. \n\nSimilarly, 0.70 mm is 0.70 × 10⁻³ m, which is 7.0 × 10⁻⁴ m. Correct.\n\nWavelength is 0.63 micrometers. 1 micrometer is 1 × 10⁻⁶ meters, so 0.63 micrometers is 0.63 × 10⁻⁶ m.\n\nNow, let's compute the numerator: r_{k+m}² - r_k².\n\nFirst, compute r_{k+m}²:\n\n(1.7 × 10⁻³ m)² = (1.7)² × (10⁻³)² m² = 2.89 × 10⁻⁶ m²\n\nThen compute r_k²:\n\n(0.70 × 10⁻³ m)² = (0.70)² × (10⁻³)² m² = 0.49 × 10⁻⁶ m²\n\nSubtracting them:\n\n2.89 × 10⁻⁶ m² - 0.49 × 10⁻⁶ m² = (2.89 - 0.49) × 10⁻⁶ m² = 2.4 × 10⁻⁶ m²\n\nSo numerator is 2.4 × 10⁻⁶ m².\n\nDenominator is m * λ = 10 * 0.63 × 10⁻⁶ m.\n\nCompute that:\n\n10 * 0.63 × 10⁻⁶ m = 6.3 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nTherefore, R = numerator / denominator = (2.4 × 10⁻⁶ m²) / (6.3 × 10⁻⁶ m) \n\nSimplify the units: m² / m = m. So units are meters, which is correct for radius of curvature.\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\n2.4 / 6.3 = Let me compute that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 0.3: 2.4 / 6.3 = 8 / 21 ≈ 0.38095...\n\nSo approximately 0.38095 meters. Let me check with exact decimal:\n\n2.4 divided by 6.3. Well, 2.4 / 6.3 = 24 / 63 = 8 / 21 ≈ 0.38095 m. \n\nSo R ≈ 0.381 m. But let me check if I did the arithmetic correctly.\n\nWait, numerator was 2.4 × 10⁻⁶ divided by 6.3 × 10⁻⁶. The 10⁻⁶ cancels out, so it's 2.4 / 6.3. Yes. \n\nBut let me verify the calculation again:\n\nOriginal values:\n\nr_15² - r_5² = (1.7² - 0.7²) mm². Wait, but actually, the formula uses the radii squared. Let me check if I did the squares correctly.\n\n1.7 squared is 2.89? Yes, 1.7*1.7 is 2.89. 0.7 squared is 0.49. Correct. Then 2.89 - 0.49 is 2.4. Correct. So that is 2.4 mm²? Wait, but when I converted to meters, I squared the 10⁻³. Wait, 1.7 mm is 1.7 × 10⁻³ m, so squared is (1.7)^2 × (10⁻³)^2 = 2.89 × 10⁻⁶ m². Similarly for 0.7 mm. So the subtraction is correct. \n\nSo 2.4 × 10⁻⁶ m² divided by 6.3 × 10⁻⁶ m gives 2.4 / 6.3 m ≈ 0.38095 m. So approximately 0.381 meters. \n\nBut the question says \"Calculate the radius of curvature of the lens.\" So I need to present this in a suitable unit. Maybe meters is okay, but sometimes these radii can be in meters or centimeters. Let me see. 0.38 meters is 38 centimeters. That seems reasonable for a lens curvature. \n\nBut let me check if I used the right formula. The problem mentions that the center point may not be in close contact, so they are using a formula that doesn't assume the first ring is at zero. The standard formula for Newton's rings is for dark rings when the path difference is 2t = mλ, considering the phase shift. But when the center is not in contact, maybe there's an offset. However, the formula given here is R = (r_{k+m}² - r_k²)/(mλ). \n\nLet me recall the derivation. For Newton's rings, the radius of the m-th ring is given by r_m ≈ sqrt(mλR), assuming the center is dark and in contact. However, if there is an air gap at the center, then the formula becomes r_m² = (m + c)λR, where c is some constant accounting for the offset. Therefore, if you take the difference between two rings, say the (k + m)-th and the k-th, then r_{k + m}² - r_k² = ( (k + m + c)λR - (k + c)λR ) = mλR. Therefore, R = [r_{k + m}² - r_k²]/(mλ). So that formula is correct regardless of the offset. Therefore, using this formula is the right approach here. \n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct. So R ≈ 0.381 m. Let me compute 2.4 / 6.3 more accurately. \n\nDividing 2.4 by 6.3:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10: 24 / 63. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 8 / 21 ≈ 0.380952... So approximately 0.38095 m. \n\nTo express this with appropriate significant figures. Let me check the given data. The radii are given as 0.70 mm and 1.7 mm. The first has two decimal places, but significant figures: 0.70 mm is two significant figures? Wait, 0.70 has two decimal places, but in terms of significant figures, the trailing zero after the decimal is significant. So 0.70 mm is two significant figures? Wait, 0.70 has two significant figures if the zeros are after the decimal and after non-zero digits. Wait, actually, 0.70 has two significant figures: the '7' and the trailing zero. Similarly, 1.7 mm has two significant figures. The wavelength is given as 0.63 micrometers, which is two significant figures. \n\nTherefore, all the given quantities have two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be given to two significant figures. \n\nSo 0.38095... m rounds to 0.38 m. But wait, 0.38 has two significant figures? Let me check. If I write 0.38 m, the leading zeros are not significant, so the '3' and '8' are significant, so two significant figures. Correct. \n\nBut let me check if my calculation is precise. Let me recast the numbers with their uncertainties. However, since the problem doesn't specify uncertainties, just the values, we go by significant figures. \n\nBut wait, 0.70 mm is two decimal places but in terms of significant figures, as I said, it's two. Similarly 1.7 is two. So when we compute 2.4 / 6.3, which is approx 0.38095, with two significant figures, that would be 0.38 m. \n\nBut let me check if during the calculation, maybe there was a step with more significant figures. For example, when I calculated r_{15}² - r_5², which was 2.4 × 10⁻⁶ m². The original numbers were 1.7 mm and 0.70 mm. Let me check how precise that subtraction is. \n\nOriginal values:\n\nr_15 = 1.7 mm. Let's assume that's ±0.05 mm? But since we are not given uncertainties, we can't do error propagation. But for significant figures, 1.7 has two, 0.70 has two. When multiplying or dividing, the number of significant figures is determined by the least number. However, when adding or subtracting, it's determined by decimal places. But here we are squaring and subtracting. \n\nBut let's think of the calculation:\n\nr_{15}² - r_5² = (1.7² - 0.70²) mm². \n\nCalculating 1.7²: 2.89 mm². But 1.7 has two significant figures, so 2.89 should be rounded to 2.9 mm²? Wait, no, when squaring, the significant figures are maintained as per multiplication rules. However, during the calculation, we keep more digits to avoid rounding errors, and then round at the end. \n\nBut since we are going to use these numbers in another division, perhaps we need to carry more decimals. However, since all given data has two significant figures, the final answer must have two. \n\nBut let me check with exact numbers. Let me redo the calculation with more precise numbers. Suppose the radii are exactly 0.70 mm and 1.7 mm. Then:\n\nr_15² - r_5² = (1.7^2 - 0.7^2) mm² = (2.89 - 0.49) mm² = 2.4 mm². \n\nBut converting to meters squared, it's 2.4 × 10⁻⁶ m². \n\nSo that is exact given the numbers. Then m is 10, which is an exact integer. The wavelength is 0.63 micrometers, which is two significant figures. \n\nTherefore, in the formula R = [r² difference]/(mλ), the numerator is 2.4 × 10⁻⁶ m², denominator is 10 * 0.63 × 10⁻⁶ m = 6.3 × 10⁻⁶ m. \n\nSo R = 2.4 / 6.3 m ≈ 0.38095 m. \n\nSince the numerator (2.4) has two significant figures and the denominator (6.3) has two significant figures, the result should have two significant figures. Therefore, 0.38 m. \n\nBut 0.38 m is 38 cm. However, sometimes in optics, radii of curvature are expressed in meters or centimeters. Let me check if converting to centimeters would make sense. 0.38 m is 38 cm. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in meters, then 0.38 m. But let me check if there's a calculation mistake. Let me verify once again:\n\nGiven:\n\nr_5 = 0.70 mm = 0.70e-3 m\n\nr_15 = 1.7 mm = 1.7e-3 m\n\nCompute r_15² - r_5²:\n\n(1.7e-3)^2 - (0.70e-3)^2 = (2.89e-6) - (0.49e-6) = 2.4e-6 m²\n\nm = 15 - 5 = 10\n\nλ = 0.63e-6 m\n\nSo R = 2.4e-6 / (10 * 0.63e-6) = 2.4 / 6.3 = approx 0.38095 m. \n\nYes. So 0.38 m with two significant figures. \n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in the formula. The formula is R = (r_{k+m}² - r_k²)/(mλ). \n\nYes, as per the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, if I recall, the standard formula for Newton's rings when the center is not dark (i.e., there is an additional phase shift or some offset) is that the radius squared is proportional to (m + something) times lambda R. Therefore, taking the difference between two rings cancels the \"something\", hence the formula given here. So that formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me suppose that the formula for the radius of the m-th ring is:\n\nr_m² = (m + c) * λ * R \n\nWhere c is some constant due to the offset (if the center is not in contact). Then, for the fifth ring:\n\nr_5² = (5 + c) * λ * R \n\nFor the fifteenth ring:\n\nr_15² = (15 + c) * λ * R \n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\nr_15² - r_5² = (15 + c - 5 - c) * λ * R = 10 * λ * R \n\nTherefore, R = (r_15² - r_5²)/(10 * λ), which is exactly the formula given. So the derivation is correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nSo, with that, R ≈ 0.38 m. \n\nBut let me check if the answer is perhaps expected in centimeters or another unit. 0.38 meters is 38 centimeters. Depending on the context, maybe meters is okay. However, sometimes radii of curvature for lenses can be in the order of meters or centimeters. 38 cm seems reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, if there was a miscalculation in unit conversion. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal radii: 0.70 mm and 1.7 mm. Squared gives mm². Then converting to meters squared:\n\n(0.70 mm)^2 = (0.70 mm)^2 * (1 m / 1000 mm)^2 = 0.49 mm² * 1e-6 m² / mm² = 0.49e-6 m². Wait, no:\n\nWait, 1 mm is 1e-3 m. Therefore, 1 mm² is (1e-3 m)^2 = 1e-6 m². Therefore, 0.70 mm is 0.70e-3 m. Squared is (0.70e-3)^2 = 0.49e-6 m². Similarly for 1.7 mm: (1.7e-3)^2 = 2.89e-6 m². Then difference is 2.89e-6 - 0.49e-6 = 2.4e-6 m². Correct. \n\nThen m is 10, λ is 0.63 micrometers = 0.63e-6 m. \n\nSo denominator is 10 * 0.63e-6 = 6.3e-6 m. \n\nSo R = 2.4e-6 / 6.3e-6 = 2.4 / 6.3 ≈ 0.38095 m. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 0.38 meters. \n\nBut let me check if the question expects more decimal places. However, given that the input data has two significant figures, we can't have more than two in the answer. Therefore, 0.38 m is correct. \n\nBut wait, 0.38 has two decimal places but in terms of significant figures, the leading zero is not significant. So 0.38 is two significant figures. Correct. \n\nAlternatively, if written in scientific notation, it would be 3.8 × 10⁻¹ m, which clearly shows two significant figures. \n\nTherefore, the radius of curvature R is approximately 0.38 meters. \n\nBut let me check once again with the numbers. Let me compute 2.4 / 6.3 exactly. \n\nDividing 2.4 by 6.3:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate decimal: 4.8 / 12.6. Still not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, note that 6.3 × 0.38 = 6 × 0.38 + 0.3 × 0.38 = 2.28 + 0.114 = 2.394, which is approximately 2.4. So yes, 0.38 × 6.3 ≈ 2.4. Therefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.38 meters. \n\nBut let me check if the problem expects the answer in centimeters. 0.38 meters is 38 centimeters. Maybe the answer is expected in meters, but just to be thorough, perhaps I should check with the original units. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in unit conversion for the wavelength. Let me check:\n\nWavelength is 0.63 micrometers. 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So yes, 0.63 micrometers is 0.63e-6 meters. Correct. \n\nTherefore, all unit conversions are correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe radius of curvature of the lens is \\boxed{0.38} meters.\n</think>"}
