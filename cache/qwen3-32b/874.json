The orbital speed is given by:\n\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,\n- $ M $ is Earth's mass,\n- $ r $ is the radius of the orbit.\n\nAt this point, the satellite is in a **stable circular orbit** with constant kinetic and potential energy.\n\n---\n\n### **Effect of the Meteor Impact**\n\nThe meteor increases the satellite’s **tangential speed by 1%**, but does **not** change the direction of its velocity. This means the satellite now has **more kinetic energy** than before but is still at the same distance from Earth. This excess kinetic energy causes the satellite to **deviate from its circular path**.\n\nWhen the speed is increased **tangentially** at a point in orbit, the satellite gains enough energy to **escape the circular orbit**, but not enough to escape Earth’s gravity entirely. The result is an **elliptical orbit**.\n\n---\n\n### **Determining the Nature of the New Orbit**\n\nTo determine whether point $ P $ (where the meteor hit) is the **closest** or **farthest** point in the new orbit, we use the **vis-viva equation**:\n\n$$\nv^2 = GM\\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ v $ is the speed at a given point,\n- $ r $ is the distance from the center of Earth,\n- $ a $ is the **semi-major axis** of the orbit.\n\nBefore the collision, the satellite was in a circular orbit with $ r = a $. After the collision, the new speed $ v' = 1.01v $ implies:\n\n$$\n(1.01v)^2 = GM\\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a'}\\right)\n$$\n\nSolving this shows that the **semi-major axis** $ a' $ is **larger** than $ r $, confirming the orbit is now **elliptical** with a **larger average distance** from Earth.\n\nIn an elliptical orbit, the **point where the velocity is highest** is the **closest point to Earth (periapsis)**, and the **point where the velocity is lowest** is the **farthest point from Earth (apoapsis)**. Since the speed was **increased at point $ P $**, that point becomes the **closest point** to Earth in the new orbit.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe satellite is now in an **elliptical orbit**, where the point of the meteor impact, $ P $, is the **closest approach to Earth (periapsis)**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, there's a satellite orbiting Earth in a circular orbit just above the atmosphere. Then a meteor hits it at point P, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the direction of its velocity. The question is asking what the new orbit looks like. The options are between an elliptical orbit with P as the farthest or closest point, or a circle with larger or smaller radius.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a circular orbit, the speed is perfectly balanced so that the centripetal acceleration required for the circular motion is provided by gravity. The formula for the orbital speed is v = sqrt(GM/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the radius of the orbit. If the satellite is moving faster than this speed, what happens? I think that would mean it has more kinetic energy, so maybe it would go into an elliptical orbit. But I need to recall how changing velocity affects the orbit.\n\nWhen an object in a circular orbit speeds up, it's no longer in a circular orbit. If you increase the speed tangentially, you add energy to the system. The orbit becomes elliptical. In an elliptical orbit, the point where the satellite is closest to Earth is called the periapsis, and the farthest is apoapsis. The question is whether point P becomes the periapsis or the apoapsis.\n\nWait, when you give a satellite a tangential speed boost, you're giving it more kinetic energy at that point. Since energy is conserved, but now the satellite has more energy. In an elliptical orbit, the satellite will have varying speeds—faster when closer to Earth (due to conservation of angular momentum) and slower when farther away. So if you increase the speed at point P, that point would be the periapsis because that's where the satellite is moving fastest in the new orbit. Wait, but if you speed it up, wouldn't it move away from Earth? Hmm, maybe I need to think about the energy and the orbit shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the vis-viva equation, which relates the speed of an object in an orbit to its distance from the central body. The vis-viva equation is: v² = GM(2/r - 1/a), where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the radius r is equal to the semi-major axis a. So if the satellite was originally in a circular orbit with radius r, then v_original² = GM/r. After the collision, the speed increases by 1%, so the new speed v_new = 1.01*v_original. Plugging into the vis-viva equation:\n\n(1.01v_original)² = GM(2/r - 1/a)\n\nLet me compute the left side: (1.01)² * v_original² = 1.0201 * GM/r\n\nSo:\n\n1.0201 * GM/r = GM(2/r - 1/a)\n\nDivide both sides by GM:\n\n1.0201 / r = 2/r - 1/a\n\nSubtract 2/r from both sides:\n\n1.0201 / r - 2/r = -1/a\n\nWhich is:\n\n(1.0201 - 2)/r = -1/a\n\nCalculating 1.0201 - 2 = -0.9799\n\nSo:\n\n-0.9799 / r = -1/a\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.9799 / r = 1/a\n\nTherefore:\n\na = r / 0.9799 ≈ 1.0203 r\n\nSo the semi-major axis a is slightly larger than the original radius r. Since the semi-major axis is larger, the orbit is now elliptical with a larger semi-major axis. But what about the point P? Since the velocity was increased at point P, is that point the periapsis or apoapsis?\n\nIn an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis is the average of the periapsis and apoapsis distances. If we increased the speed at point P, that would mean that we added energy at that point. If you add energy at a point in the orbit, that point becomes the periapsis if you are adding speed (because the satellite will go out to a higher apoapsis). Wait, let me think again. If you are at a circular orbit and you speed up tangentially, you are giving the satellite more kinetic energy, so it will move out to a higher orbit. But since it's not a circular orbit anymore, it will have an elliptical orbit where the point where you applied the thrust is the periapsis, because that's where it's closest and moving fastest. The apoapsis will be on the opposite side of the orbit.\n\nSo if the satellite was at point P, and you increase its speed there, then point P becomes the periapsis (closest point) of the new elliptical orbit, because after that point, the satellite will move out to a higher apoapsis. Therefore, the answer would be that the satellite now orbits in an ellipse with P as the closest approach to Earth, which is option B.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Suppose you have a circular orbit. If you fire a rocket to go into a higher circular orbit, you need to speed up twice: once to go into an elliptical transfer orbit (Hohmann transfer), and then again at the apoapsis to circularize. So if you only speed up once, you end up in an elliptical orbit with the point of the burn as the periapsis and a higher apoapsis. Therefore, if you increase speed at a point in a circular orbit, that point becomes the periapsis of the new elliptical orbit. Therefore, option B says P is the closest approach, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if you slow down at a point, that would make it the apoapsis, because the satellite would lose energy and the closest approach would be lower.\n\nSo the answer is B.\n</think>"}
