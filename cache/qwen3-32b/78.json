The options are CO₂, CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻. Let me start by recalling what hybridization is. Hybridization is when atomic orbitals mix to form new hybrid orbitals that are suitable for bonding. The type of hybridization depends on the number of electron domains around the central atom.\n\nFirst, let me remember the basic concept. For a central atom, the hybridization is determined by the number of regions of electron density (bonding pairs and lone pairs). The formula or method is usually to count the number of sigma bonds and lone pairs. Each sigma bond and each lone pair counts as one region. Then, the number of regions corresponds to the hybridization: 2 regions = sp, 3 regions = sp², 4 regions = sp³, and so on.\n\nSo, for each molecule, I need to determine the number of electron domains around the central atom and then figure out the hybridization.\n\nStarting with CO₂. Carbon dioxide. Carbon is the central atom. Carbon has two double bonds with oxygen. Each double bond is one sigma and one pi bond. But for hybridization, we only consider sigma bonds and lone pairs. So, how many regions of electron density does carbon have here? Carbon is bonded to two oxygens via double bonds. But each double bond is considered as one region. So, carbon has two regions of electron density. Therefore, two regions mean sp hybridization. So CO₂ is sp hybridized. So that's not sp², so it's out.\n\nNext, CO₃²⁻. The carbonate ion. Carbon is the central atom here. Let me draw the Lewis structure. Carbon has three double bonds? Wait, no. Wait, carbonate ion has a charge of -2. Carbon usually has four valence electrons. Let me count the total valence electrons. Carbon has 4, each oxygen has 6, three oxygens is 18. Plus 2- charge adds two more electrons, total is 4 + 18 + 2 = 24 electrons.\n\nDrawing the Lewis structure: Carbon is central. Connect each oxygen with single bonds. That uses 3 bonds, 6 electrons. Remaining electrons: 24 - 6 = 18. Distribute those as lone pairs. Each oxygen would have 6 electrons (since each has a single bond, so 6 - 2 = 4 more, but wait, total per oxygen... Wait, each oxygen has 6 valence electrons. If it's bonded with a single bond, that's one bond (two electrons), so each oxygen would have 6 - 2 = 4 electrons left, but wait, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, total electrons in the structure: 24. After making three single bonds (each bond is 2 electrons, so 3*2=6), we have 24-6=18 electrons left. Distribute them as lone pairs on the oxygens. Each oxygen would get 6 electrons (3 lone pairs), but three oxygens would need 3*6=18. So that's perfect. But then the carbon has only 3 bonds (6 electrons) and no lone pairs. That would give carbon only 6 electrons, which is not octet. So we need to make a double bond to give carbon a complete octet. So in carbonate ion, there is one double bond and two single bonds. But resonance structures mean that the double bond can be any of the three oxygens. So the central carbon has three regions of electron density: three bonds (one double, two single, but each bond is considered one region). So three regions. Therefore, the hybridization is sp². So CO₃²⁻ is sp² hybridized. So that's one candidate.\n\nNext, NO₂⁻. Nitrite ion. Central atom is nitrogen. Let's draw the Lewis structure. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, each oxygen has 6, two oxygens is 12. Plus one negative charge adds one electron. Total valence electrons: 5 + 12 + 1 = 18.\n\nDrawing the structure: Nitrogen is central. Connect each oxygen with single bonds. That uses 2 bonds (4 electrons). Remaining electrons: 18 - 4 = 14. Distribute as lone pairs. Each oxygen would have 6 electrons (since each has a single bond, so 6-2=4 more, but let's count. Wait, total electrons after bonds: 14. Let me assign. Each oxygen with single bonds would have 6 electrons (3 lone pairs). So two oxygens would have 12 electrons. Then the nitrogen would have 18 - 12 (from oxygens) - 4 (from bonds) = 2 electrons? Wait, maybe better to do step by step.\n\nTotal electrons: 18. Two single bonds (N-O), which is 4 electrons. Remaining 14. Assign to oxygens first. Each oxygen needs 6 electrons (since they are more electronegative). Each oxygen already has one bond (2 electrons), so they need 6 more. So each oxygen would have 6 electrons as lone pairs. For two oxygens: 2*(6) = 12 electrons. But we have 14 remaining after bonds. So 12 assigned to oxygens, leaving 2 electrons. Those go on nitrogen. So nitrogen has a single bond to each oxygen, and a lone pair. But nitrogen has 5 valence electrons. Let's check the formal charges. Nitrogen: 5 - (number of bonds + number of lone electrons). Wait, bonds are 2 (two single bonds), and lone electrons are 2 (one lone pair). So formal charge is 5 - (2 + 2) = 1. But the overall charge is -1. Wait, maybe there's a better structure with a double bond. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, if we have one double bond and one single bond. Let's try that. Let's say one N=O and one N-O. Total bonds: one double and one single, which is 3 bonds (since double bond is 2 bonds? Wait, no. Each bond is a sigma bond. Wait, for Lewis structures, when we draw double bonds, it's one sigma and one pi. But for counting regions, each bond is considered one region regardless of single or double. But for formal charges, let me recalculate.\n\nIf there's one double bond and one single bond. Total bonds would be one double (counts as one region) and one single (another region). So two bonds. Wait, but nitrogen is central with two oxygens. So two bonds. But then, how many lone pairs? Let's count electrons again. Total is 18. If we have one double bond and one single bond, that's 3 bonds? Wait, no. A double bond is one bond (but two pairs of electrons). Wait, maybe I need to count the number of bonds in terms of electron pairs. Let me think again.\n\nTotal valence electrons: 18. Let me try to draw it with resonance. The nitrite ion has resonance structures. The actual structure has one double bond and one single bond, but they resonate. So the nitrogen has a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond to the other. Let me count the regions. Nitrogen has two bonds (the double and single count as two regions?), no. Wait, each bond (single, double, triple) is considered one region. So in this case, the central nitrogen has two bonding regions (one double bond and one single bond, but both count as one each). So two bonding regions. But wait, the nitrogen also has a lone pair. Wait, let's count the regions. The nitrogen has two bonds (two regions) and one lone pair (another region). So total of three regions. Therefore, three regions of electron density. So hybridization is sp². Wait, but let me check.\n\nWait, the Lewis structure: If there is a double bond and a single bond, and a lone pair on nitrogen. Let me count the regions. The nitrogen has three regions: two bonds (one double, one single) and one lone pair. So three regions. Therefore, sp² hybridization. Therefore, NO₂⁻ is sp² hybridized. So that's another candidate.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Let me count the number of sigma bonds and lone pairs. For hybridization, the number of sigma bonds plus lone pairs gives the number of hybrid orbitals. Each bond (single, double, triple) has one sigma bond. So in NO₂⁻, the nitrogen has two sigma bonds (one to each oxygen) and one lone pair. So total three regions. Therefore, sp² hybridization. So yes, sp². So NO₂⁻ is sp².\n\nNext molecule is NO₃⁻, nitrate ion. Central atom is nitrogen. Let's draw the Lewis structure. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, each oxygen has 6, three oxygens is 18. Plus one negative charge adds one electron. Total valence electrons: 5 + 18 + 1 = 24.\n\nDrawing the Lewis structure. Nitrogen is central. Connect each oxygen with single bonds. That uses 3 bonds, 6 electrons. Remaining electrons: 24 - 6 = 18. Assign to oxygens as lone pairs. Each oxygen would have 6 electrons (three lone pairs), so three oxygens would have 18. So that's 18 electrons. But then nitrogen has three single bonds and no lone pairs. So nitrogen has 6 electrons. Needs an octet. Therefore, we need to form double bonds. In nitrate ion, there are resonance structures with one double bond and two single bonds. So each oxygen has a double bond in different resonance structures. So the central nitrogen has three bonds (each bond is a region). So three regions. Therefore, hybridization is sp². So NO₃⁻ is sp² hybridized.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nCO₂: sp hybridization (two regions)\n\nCO₃²⁻: sp² (three regions)\n\nNO₂⁻: sp² (three regions)\n\nNO₃⁻: sp² (three regions)\n\nTherefore, the molecules with sp² hybridization are CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻. Wait, but the options given are:\n\nA: CO₂ and CO₃²⁻\n\nB: NO₂⁻ and NO₃⁻\n\nC: CO₃²⁻ and NO₃⁻\n\nD: CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻ and NO₃⁻\n\nSo according to my analysis, the correct answer is D: CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for NO₂⁻, I thought three regions. Let me confirm. Let's think about the structure again. Nitrogen with two oxygens. If there's a double bond and a single bond, and a lone pair on nitrogen. So the regions are: two bonding regions (the two bonds, regardless of single or double) and one lone pair. So total three regions. Therefore, sp² hybridization. So yes, three regions. So NO₂⁻ is sp². Similarly, CO₃²⁻ is three regions (three bonds, one double, two single, but all count as regions) and no lone pairs on carbon. Wait, carbon in CO₃²⁻ has three bonds and no lone pairs. So three regions. So sp². NO₃⁻ is three bonds and no lone pairs on nitrogen? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, nitrate ion: nitrogen has three bonds (one double, two single) and one lone pair? Wait, let me count the electrons again. Total valence electrons for NO₃⁻: 5 + 3*6 + 1 = 24. Drawing Lewis structure. Three single bonds: 3*2=6. Remaining 24-6=18. Assign to oxygens as lone pairs: each oxygen has 6, so 3*6=18. Then nitrogen has three bonds and no lone pairs. But nitrogen would have 6 electrons. So we need to have a double bond. So one double bond and two single bonds. So nitrogen has three bonds (one double, two single). But how many lone pairs? Let me count formal charges. Nitrogen: 5 - (number of bonds + number of lone electrons). Wait, bonds are 3 (each bond is one sigma), but in terms of formal charge calculation, bonds count as 1 per bond for the atom. Wait, formal charge is calculated as: valence electrons - (number of bonds + number of non-bonding electrons). Wait, no. The formula is: Formal charge = Valence electrons - (Number of non-bonding electrons + ½ Number of bonding electrons). So for nitrogen in nitrate ion with three bonds (each bond has two electrons, so total bonding electrons is 3*2=6). So formal charge would be 5 - (non-bonding electrons + ½ * 6). If there are no non-bonding electrons on nitrogen, then formal charge is 5 - (0 + 3) = +2. But the overall charge is -1. So that's not right. So maybe there's a lone pair on nitrogen.\n\nWait, let's recalculate. If there is one double bond and two single bonds. Let me count the bonding electrons. The double bond has 4 electrons (two bonds?), no. Wait, each bond is a sigma bond. The double bond is one sigma and one pi. But for Lewis structure, when we draw a double bond, it's two pairs of electrons. So for the bonding electrons, each bond contributes two electrons. So for three bonds (one double and two single), the total bonding electrons would be (2 + 2 + 4) = 8? Wait, no. Wait, each single bond is two electrons. Each double bond is four electrons. So if we have one double bond and two single bonds, total bonding electrons is 4 + 2 + 2 = 8. Then non-bonding electrons on nitrogen? Let's see. Total valence electrons is 24. So bonding electrons is 8, so non-bonding electrons is 24 - 8 = 16. Which is assigned to the oxygens. Each oxygen with a single bond has 6 non-bonding electrons (three lone pairs), and the one with double bond has 4 non-bonding electrons (two lone pairs). So total non-bonding electrons: two oxygens with 6 each (total 12) and one oxygen with 4: total 16. So that works. But where is the nitrogen's electrons? Wait, the bonding electrons are 8. The nitrogen is part of those bonds. The nitrogen's valence electrons are accounted for in the bonds and any lone pairs it has. Wait, but how many lone pairs does nitrogen have? If the bonding electrons are 8 (so four bonds? No, three bonds: one double and two single). Wait, nitrogen has three bonds. The double bond is one bond (but two pairs of electrons). So for formal charge calculation, each bond counts as one bond. So nitrogen has three bonds. Valence electrons for nitrogen is 5. Formal charge is 5 - (number of non-bonding electrons + number of bonds). Wait, the formula is 5 - (non-bonding electrons + bonding electrons/2). Wait, bonding electrons is 8 (from above). So bonding electrons/2 is 4. If nitrogen has no non-bonding electrons, then formal charge is 5 - (0 + 4) = +1. But the overall charge is -1. Wait, maybe I need to consider that in reality, there is a lone pair on nitrogen. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct Lewis structure for nitrate ion is that nitrogen has one lone pair. Let me try. If nitrogen has one lone pair (two electrons), then the bonding electrons would be 24 total valence electrons minus the non-bonding electrons. If nitrogen has two non-bonding electrons, and the oxygens have the rest. Let me recalculate.\n\nTotal valence electrons: 24.\n\nSuppose nitrogen has one lone pair (2 electrons). Then the remaining electrons for bonds and other non-bonding electrons is 24 - 2 = 22.\n\nIf there are three bonds (one double and two single), which is 8 bonding electrons as before. Then the non-bonding electrons on oxygens would be 22 - 8 = 14. Let's see: each oxygen with a single bond would have 6 non-bonding electrons (three lone pairs), and the one with double bond would have 4. So total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Which is more than 14. Hmm, not matching. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the correct structure is that nitrogen has no lone pairs. Let's see. Total valence electrons: 24. If nitrogen has no lone pairs, then all 24 electrons are in bonds and non-bonding on oxygens. If there are three bonds (one double and two single), which is 8 bonding electrons. Then non-bonding electrons on oxygens is 24 - 8 = 16. Which matches the earlier calculation. So in this case, nitrogen has no lone pairs. Then formal charge on nitrogen is 5 - (0 + 8/2) = 5 - 4 = +1. Each oxygen with a single bond has formal charge: 6 - (6 non-bonding + 2/2) = 6 - (6 + 1) = -1. The oxygen with double bond has formal charge: 6 - (4 non-bonding + 4/2) = 6 - (4 + 2) = 0. So total formal charges: +1 (N) + 2*(-1) (two oxygens) + 0 (one oxygen) = +1 -2 = -1, which matches the overall charge. So the structure is correct with nitrogen having no lone pairs. Therefore, the regions around nitrogen are three bonding regions (three bonds), no lone pairs. Therefore, three regions of electron density. So hybridization is sp². Therefore, NO₃⁻ is sp² hybridized. So even though nitrogen has no lone pairs, the three bonds mean three regions, hence sp².\n\nSo going back to NO₂⁻. Let me check again. Valence electrons: 18. Let's say there's one double bond and one single bond. So bonding electrons: double bond is 4, single bond is 2, total 6. Non-bonding electrons: 18 - 6 = 12. Assign to oxygens and nitrogen. Each oxygen with single bond has 6 non-bonding electrons, and the one with double bond has 4. So total non-bonding on oxygens: 6 + 4 = 10. Then nitrogen has 12 - 10 = 2 non-bonding electrons (one lone pair). So nitrogen has one lone pair and two bonds (one double, one single). Therefore, three regions. So sp² hybridization. Correct.\n\nTherefore, all three ions (CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻, NO₃⁻) have sp² hybridization. CO₂ is sp hybridized.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA: CO₂ and CO₃²⁻ → CO₂ is sp, so incorrect.\n\nB: NO₂⁻ and NO₃⁻ → misses CO₃²⁻, but CO₃²⁻ is also sp².\n\nC: CO₃²⁻ and NO₃⁻ → misses NO₂⁻, which is also sp².\n\nD: CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻ and NO₃⁻ → all three, which matches our analysis.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more for NO₂⁻. Is it really three regions? Yes. Because the nitrogen has two bonds (one double, one single) and one lone pair. Three regions. So sp². Yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
