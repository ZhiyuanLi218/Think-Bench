The problem says that z^13 = w, w^11 = z, and the imaginary part of z is sin(mπ/n) where m and n are coprime positive integers with m < n. I need to find n. Alright, let me start by writing down what I know.\n\nFirst, z and w are complex numbers. The equations given are z^13 = w and w^11 = z. So, if I substitute one into the other, maybe I can find a relationship for z. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with z^13 = w. Then, substitute this into the second equation: (z^13)^11 = z. Simplify that exponent: z^(13*11) = z => z^143 = z. Then, if I divide both sides by z (assuming z ≠ 0, which I should check later), I get z^142 = 1. So z is a 142nd root of unity. Similarly, maybe w is also a root of unity?\n\nBut wait, let me check if z could be zero. If z = 0, then w = z^13 = 0, and then w^11 = 0 = z, which works. However, the problem says that the imaginary part of z is sin(mπ/n). If z were 0, its imaginary part would be 0, which is sin(0π/1), but m and n need to be positive integers with m < n. If m is 0, but the problem says m and n are positive integers. Therefore, z cannot be zero. So z is a 142nd root of unity, meaning z = e^(2πik/142) for some integer k between 0 and 141. But since z ≠ 0, that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, since w = z^13, then w would be e^(2πi*13k/142). Then, let's check the other equation w^11 = z. Let me compute w^11:\n\nw^11 = [e^(2πi*13k/142)]^11 = e^(2πi*143k/142) = e^(2πi*(1 + 1k/142)) = e^(2πi) * e^(2πi*k/142) = 1 * e^(2πi*k/142) = z. Which is indeed equal to z. So that works out. Therefore, z is a primitive dth root of unity, where d divides 142? Or maybe not necessarily primitive, but any 142nd root. But since we need to find the imaginary part of z, which is sin(mπ/n), perhaps we need to figure out what angle z corresponds to.\n\nSo, z is e^(2πik/142) for some integer k, so its imaginary part is sin(2πk/142). But the problem says the imaginary part is sin(mπ/n). Therefore, sin(2πk/142) = sin(mπ/n). Therefore, we need to find m/n such that mπ/n = 2πk/142 + 2πj or π - 2πk/142 + 2πj for some integers j, because sine is periodic and has symmetry.\n\nBut since sine is periodic with period 2π, we can ignore the 2πj part because it would correspond to adding multiples of the period. Therefore, we can say that either:\n\nCase 1: mπ/n = 2πk/142 + 2πj, or\n\nCase 2: mπ/n = π - 2πk/142 + 2πj.\n\nDividing both sides by π:\n\nCase 1: m/n = 2k/142 + 2j = k/71 + 2j.\n\nCase 2: m/n = 1 - 2k/142 + 2j = 1 - k/71 + 2j.\n\nBut since m and n are positive integers with m < n, we need to find fractions m/n that equal to either k/71 + 2j or 1 - k/71 + 2j for some integers j and k, where 0 ≤ k ≤ 141 (but since z is a root of unity, k can be from 0 to 141, but since we have m/n between 0 and 1 (since m < n), let's see.\n\nBut first, note that 142 is 2*71. So 142 is twice a prime number, 71. So the roots of unity here are either primitive 71st roots, primitive 142nd roots, or primitive 2nd roots. But since z^142 = 1, z can be any of these.\n\nBut since z is not zero, and we need the imaginary part of z, which is sin(θ), where θ is the argument of z. Since z is on the unit circle, θ is between 0 and 2π. But the imaginary part is sin(θ), so depending on θ, sin(θ) can be positive or negative. However, since sin(mπ/n) is given, and m and n are positive integers with m < n, then sin(mπ/n) is positive because mπ/n is between 0 and π (since m/n < 1, so mπ/n < π). Wait, no. If m/n is between 0 and 1, then mπ/n is between 0 and π. However, sin(θ) for θ between π and 2π is negative, but since the imaginary part is given as sin(mπ/n), which is positive, that would mean that θ must be between 0 and π. Therefore, the argument θ of z is between 0 and π.\n\nTherefore, θ = 2πk/142 must be between 0 and π. Therefore, 2πk/142 ≤ π => k ≤ 71. So k is between 0 and 71. However, k=0 would give θ=0, so sin(θ)=0, but as before, m and n have to be positive integers, so m=0 is invalid. Therefore, k is between 1 and 71.\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part of z is sin(2πk/142) = sin(πk/71). Therefore, sin(πk/71) = sin(mπ/n). Therefore, πk/71 = mπ/n + 2πj or πk/71 = π - mπ/n + 2πj. Dividing by π:\n\nk/71 = m/n + 2j or k/71 = 1 - m/n + 2j.\n\nSince k and 71 are integers, and m and n are integers, we can analyze these equations. Let's consider the first case:\n\nCase 1: k/71 = m/n + 2j.\n\nBut since k/71 is between 1/71 and 71/71 = 1, and m/n is between 0 and 1, adding 2j would require that j=0, otherwise if j is positive, m/n would be negative, which is not allowed, and if j is negative, m/n would be greater than k/71 + something negative. Let's check.\n\nIf j=0: k/71 = m/n. Therefore, m/n = k/71. Since m and n are coprime, n must be a divisor of 71. Since 71 is prime, n is either 1 or 71. However, m/n must be in lowest terms with m < n. If n=71, then m=k, and since k is between 1 and 71, m and n=71 are coprime only if k and 71 are coprime. Since 71 is prime, k must not be a multiple of 71. But k is between 1 and 71, so k can be from 1 to 70. Therefore, possible n is 71 here. But let's check the other case.\n\nCase 2: k/71 = 1 - m/n + 2j. Let's rearrange:\n\nm/n = 1 - k/71 - 2j.\n\nAgain, since m/n is between 0 and 1, let's see possible values of j. Let's suppose j=0:\n\nm/n = 1 - k/71. Therefore, m/n = (71 - k)/71. Since k is between 1 and 71, 71 - k is between 0 and 70. So m/n is between 0 and 70/71. Since m and n are coprime, again n must be 71 here, and m = 71 - k. Since k ranges from 1 to 71, m ranges from 70 down to 0. Again, m must be positive, so m=71 -k ≥1 implies that k ≤70. Therefore, k ranges from 1 to 70 here. Therefore, same as before, n=71.\n\nIf j is not zero, say j=1, then m/n = 1 - k/71 - 2. That would be negative, which is invalid. If j=-1, then m/n = 1 - k/71 + 2 = 3 - k/71. Since k is between 1 and 71, 3 - k/71 is between 3 - 71/71 = 3 - 1 = 2 and 3 - 1/71 ≈ 2.986. But m/n must be less than 1, so this is invalid. Therefore, only j=0 is valid in both cases. Therefore, in both cases, m/n is either k/71 or (71 -k)/71. Therefore, regardless of case, n=71. Therefore, the answer is 71? Wait, but the problem says \"the imaginary part of z is sin(mπ/n)\", and we have that the imaginary part is sin(πk/71). Therefore, sin(πk/71) = sin(mπ/n). Therefore, either πk/71 = mπ/n + 2πj or πk/71 = π - mπ/n + 2πj. Which simplifies to the same equations as before. But since we already considered those equations and found that n must be 71, so n=71? But wait, let me check.\n\nBut hold on, maybe there's another possibility where m/n is equivalent to something else? For example, maybe πk/71 is equal to mπ/n but with different denominators? But since we have shown that in both cases, m/n must be equal to k/71 or (71 -k)/71, which are fractions with denominator 71. Therefore, n must be 71. Therefore, the answer is 71? But let me check if there are other possibilities.\n\nWait, but maybe there's an angle where sin(πk/71) equals sin(some other angle with different denominator). For example, sin(θ) = sin(π - θ). But we already considered that in case 1 and case 2. For example, if θ = πk/71, then sin(θ) = sin(π - θ) = sin(π(71 - k)/71). Therefore, both cases correspond to angles θ and π - θ, which have the same sine. Therefore, in both cases, the value of n is 71. Therefore, regardless of which case, n is 71. Therefore, the answer is 71? But the problem says \"relatively prime positive integers m and n with m < n\". Since m and n are coprime, and n is 71, which is prime, m must be between 1 and 70, and coprime with 71. Since 71 is prime, all numbers from 1 to 70 are coprime with 71. Therefore, n is 71. Therefore, the answer is 71. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the imaginary part of z is sin(mπ/n). But the imaginary part of z is sin(πk/71). Therefore, sin(πk/71) = sin(mπ/n). So, does this necessarily mean that πk/71 = mπ/n + 2πj or π - mπ/n + 2πj? Yes, because sine is injective (one-to-one) on [0, π/2] and [π/2, 3π/2] etc., but considering that both πk/71 and mπ/n are between 0 and π (since k is between 1 and 71, so πk/71 between 0 and π, and mπ/n between 0 and π because m/n < 1). Therefore, we can say that either πk/71 = mπ/n or πk/71 = π - mπ/n. Therefore, dividing by π:\n\nCase 1: k/71 = m/n => n = 71m/k. Since m and n must be integers, and m and n are coprime, this suggests that k must divide 71m. But since 71 is prime, and m and n are coprime, maybe there's more to it. Wait, but earlier I thought that m/n is either k/71 or (71 - k)/71, so if m/n = k/71, then since m and n are coprime, n must be 71 and m = k, provided that k and 71 are coprime. But if k and 71 are not coprime, then m/n would have to be simplified. However, since 71 is prime, if k is between 1 and 70, then k and 71 are coprime only if k is not a multiple of 71, which it isn't. Wait, k is between 1 and 71, so if k is 71, then m/n would be 71/71 = 1, but m/n must be less than 1, so k is between 1 and 70. Therefore, for k between 1 and 70, k and 71 are coprime because 71 is prime. Therefore, m/n = k/71 is already in lowest terms. Therefore, n is 71. Similarly, if m/n = (71 - k)/71, same thing. Since 71 - k is between 1 and 70, same reasoning applies. Therefore, n must be 71, and m is either k or 71 - k, which are between 1 and 70. Therefore, since m and n are coprime, and n is 71, which is prime, the answer is n = 71. Therefore, the answer is 71.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Let me take k=1. Then the imaginary part of z is sin(π/71). Therefore, mπ/n = π/71 => m/n = 1/71. Since 1 and 71 are coprime, n=71. Similarly, if k=2, m/n=2/71, same thing. So yes, n is 71. If k=35, m/n=35/71, same. If k=70, m/n=70/71. All of these have n=71. Similarly, if we take the other case where m/n=(71 -k)/71, same thing. So regardless, n is 71. Therefore, the answer is 71.\n\nBut let me check if there is a case where maybe m/n is something else. For example, suppose that sin(πk/71) equals sin(pπ/q) where q is different from 71. For example, maybe some angle that's a multiple of another fraction. For example, sin(π/3) = sin(2π/3), but here denominators are different. But in that case, πk/71 could be equal to π - pπ/q, so that sin(πk/71) = sin(pπ/q). However, in our problem, the question says that the imaginary part is equal to sin(mπ/n). Therefore, mπ/n is some angle whose sine is equal to sin(πk/71). However, the problem does not specify that m/n is in the range where the sine is unique. But since m and n are positive integers with m < n, mπ/n is between 0 and π. Therefore, sin(mπ/n) is uniquely determined by mπ/n in that interval. However, πk/71 is also between 0 and π. Therefore, if sin(πk/71) = sin(mπ/n), then either πk/71 = mπ/n or πk/71 = π - mπ/n. Therefore, leading to the same equations as before. Therefore, m/n is either k/71 or (71 -k)/71. Therefore, n is 71. Therefore, regardless of k, n is 71. Therefore, the answer is 71. Therefore, I think the answer is 71.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"relatively prime positive integers m and n with m < n.\" Since 71 is prime, for any k from 1 to 70, m is k or 71 -k, which are between 1 and 70, and since 71 is prime, m and n=71 are coprime. Therefore, n must be 71. Therefore, the answer is 71. Therefore, I think the answer is \\boxed{71}.\n\nBut let me check again if there's a possibility that the angle πk/71 could correspond to another sine value with a different denominator. For example, suppose that πk/71 = 2πm/n, but that would not be between 0 and π unless n is even? Wait, but sin(θ) is not necessarily equal to sin(2πm/n) unless θ is equivalent to that angle or π - that angle. However, the problem says that the imaginary part is sin(mπ/n). So mπ/n is already in the form that's between 0 and π. Therefore, if πk/71 is equal to mπ/n or π - mπ/n, so the denominators could be different? Wait, for example, suppose that πk/71 equals πm/n. Then k/71 = m/n. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 71 or something? Wait, but m and n have to be coprime. If k and 71 are coprime, then n must be 71 and m=k. If k and 71 are not coprime, then m/n would be reduced. But since 71 is prime and k is between 1 and 70, they are coprime. Therefore, m/n is k/71, reduced fraction. Since k and 71 are coprime, it's already reduced. Therefore, n=71. Therefore, regardless of k, n=71. Therefore, the answer is 71.\n\nAlternatively, if πk/71 = π - πm/n, then πk/71 = π(1 - m/n) => k/71 = 1 - m/n => m/n = 1 - k/71 = (71 - k)/71. Again, same reasoning applies. Since 71 -k is between 1 and 70, same as before. Therefore, m and n are coprime, n=71. Therefore, answer is 71. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there is a case where maybe the angle πk/71 is equivalent to some other angle with a smaller denominator. For example, if k is such that πk/71 is a rational multiple of π with a smaller denominator. For example, if πk/71 = π/2, then k/71 = 1/2 => k=71/2, which is not integer. Therefore, impossible. Similarly, if πk/71 = π/3, then k=71/3 ≈23.666, not integer. Similarly for other fractions. Since 71 is prime, unless the denominator divides 71, which is only 1 and 71, there are no other possibilities. Therefore, the only way sin(πk/71) equals sin(mπ/n) is if n=71. Therefore, answer is 71. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\nTherefore, my answer is 71.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{71}\n</think>"}
