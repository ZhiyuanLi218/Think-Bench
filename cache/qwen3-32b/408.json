The reaction is:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cu} + 4\\mathrm{HNO_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Cu(NO_3)_2} + 2\\mathrm{NO_2} \\uparrow + 2\\mathrm{H_2O}\n$$\n\nTo produce **NO**, **dilute** nitric acid is used instead. Therefore, the stated purpose does **not** match the operation.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### **Option B**:  \n**Operation**: Cool down $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ in a closed flask  \n**Purpose**: Investigate the effect of temperature on equilibrium shift  \n\n**Analysis**:  \nThe reaction involving nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide is:\n\n$$\n2\\mathrm{NO_2(g)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{N_2O_4(g)} \\quad \\Delta H < 0\n$$\n\nThis is an **exothermic** reaction in the forward direction. According to **Le Chatelier’s Principle**, cooling the system will shift the equilibrium **toward the exothermic side** (i.e., toward $\\mathrm{N_2O_4}$), which is colorless. This results in a **decrease in the brown color** of NO₂, demonstrating the effect of temperature on equilibrium.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Correct**\n\n---\n\n### **Option C**:  \n**Operation**: Drop bromine water into KI solution, add ethanol and shake  \n**Purpose**: Extract iodine generated in the solution  \n\n**Analysis**:  \nBromine is more reactive than iodine, so it displaces iodine from KI:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Br_2} + 2\\mathrm{KI} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{KBr} + \\mathrm{I_2}\n$$\n\nHowever, **ethanol is water-miscible**, so it will **not form a separate layer** to extract iodine. In extraction, immiscible solvents like **hexane or carbon tetrachloride** are used. Ethanol fails to provide a distinct organic layer for iodine extraction.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### **Option D**:  \n**Operation**: Return the remaining NaCl solid to the original reagent bottle  \n**Purpose**: Save reagents  \n\n**Analysis**:  \nThis is a **poor laboratory practice**. Once a substance has been removed from its container, it may have been exposed to **contaminants** (like moisture, dust, or other chemicals). Returning it to the original bottle can **contaminate the entire stock**, even if the substance appears pure (like NaCl).\n\n**Conclusion**: **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**:  \nThe only option that correctly matches the operation with its purpose is **Option B**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, D are correct in terms of experimental operations and their purposes. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: Insert copper wire into concentrated nitric acid to prepare NO. Wait, I remember that when copper reacts with concentrated nitric acid, the reaction produces nitrogen dioxide (NO2) instead of nitric oxide (NO). The reaction with dilute nitric acid is the one that produces NO. So inserting copper into concentrated nitric acid would actually produce NO2, not NO. So option A is incorrect. That means A is out.\n\nMoving on to option B: Cooling down NO2 in a closed flask to investigate the effect of temperature on equilibrium shift. The reaction for NO2 dimerizing into N2O4 is exothermic in the forward direction. The equilibrium is NO2 (brown gas) ⇌ N2O4 (colorless). If you cool it down, according to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will shift to the side that produces heat, which is the forward reaction (since forming N2O4 is exothermic). So cooling should shift the equilibrium to the right, making the color less brown. This would indeed show how temperature affects the equilibrium. So option B seems correct. So B is a possible correct answer.\n\nOption C: Drop bromine water into KI solution, add ethanol and shake to extract iodine. Bromine is more reactive than iodine, so it will displace iodine from KI: Br2 + 2KI → 2KBr + I2. Then, to extract iodine, you usually use a solvent that's immiscible with water. Ethanol is miscible with water, so adding ethanol wouldn't form a separate layer to extract iodine. Typically, you'd use something like hexane or carbon tetrachloride. Ethanol would just mix with water, so the iodine would dissolve in both layers, which isn't effective. So option C is incorrect. So C is out.\n\nOption D: After the experiment, return the remaining NaCl solid to the original reagent bottle to save reagents. But this is bad lab practice. Once a reagent has been taken out, especially if it's been exposed to contaminants (like air, moisture, or other substances), putting it back can contaminate the original reagent. Even if it seems like NaCl is pure, there's a risk of introducing impurities. So the correct practice is not to return leftovers to the original bottle. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo the only correct option is B. Let me double-check each one again quickly.\n\nA: Concentrated HNO3 with Cu gives NO2, so preparing NO is wrong. Correct.\n\nB: Cooling NO2 shifts equilibrium, correct application of Le Chatelier. Correct.\n\nC: Ethanol isn't a good solvent for extraction here. Correct, so C wrong.\n\nD: Returning reagents is bad. Correct, D wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n</think>"}
