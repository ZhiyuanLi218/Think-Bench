Hmm, let me start by recalling what absolute value inequalities mean. The absolute value |a| represents the distance of a from 0 on the number line. So, |x - 2| ≤ 5.6 means that the distance between x and 2 is less than or equal to 5.6. \n\nTo solve this inequality, I remember that |A| ≤ B (where B is a positive number) translates to -B ≤ A ≤ B. Applying that here, I can rewrite the inequality without the absolute value:\n\n-5.6 ≤ x - 2 ≤ 5.6\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can add 2 to all three parts of the inequality:\n\n-5.6 + 2 ≤ x - 2 + 2 ≤ 5.6 + 2\n\nCalculating each part:\n\nLeft side: -5.6 + 2 = -3.6\n\nMiddle part: x\n\nRight side: 5.6 + 2 = 7.6\n\nSo the inequality simplifies to:\n\n-3.6 ≤ x ≤ 7.6\n\nTherefore, x is between -3.6 and 7.6, inclusive. Now, the question asks for the number of integers in this solution set. Let me think about the integers that lie between -3.6 and 7.6.\n\nFirst, let me note that integers are whole numbers, positive, negative, or zero, without fractions or decimals. So I need to count all integers starting from the smallest integer greater than or equal to -3.6 up to the largest integer less than or equal to 7.6.\n\nStarting with the lower bound: -3.6. The next integer greater than -3.6 is -3 because -3.6 is between -4 and -3 on the number line. Since the inequality is \"less than or equal to,\" we include -3.6. But since we're looking for integers, we need to check if -3.6 is included. Wait, actually, the original inequality is |x - 2| ≤ 5.6, which includes all real numbers x such that x is between -3.6 and 7.6. However, since we are only interested in integers, we need to find integers that are within that interval.\n\nSo, the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to -3.6 is -3. Similarly, the largest integer less than or equal to 7.6 is 7. Therefore, the integers in the solution set are all integers from -3 up to 7, inclusive.\n\nNow, to count the number of integers from -3 to 7 inclusive. Let me recall that to find the number of integers between two integers a and b inclusive, where a ≤ b, the formula is b - a + 1. However, here, we need to make sure that both endpoints are integers. In this case, since we have already adjusted the original bounds (-3.6 and 7.6) to the nearest integers that are within the interval, which are -3 and 7, we can use this formula.\n\nSo applying the formula: 7 - (-3) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11? Wait, 7 - (-3) is 10, then 10 + 1 = 11. Let me check that again. If you have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. For example, from 1 to 3, it's 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 numbers: 1,2,3. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo here, from -3 to 7 inclusive, the number of integers is 7 - (-3) + 1. Let me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, 7 - (-3) = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThen 10 + 1 = 11. So there are 11 integers.\n\nBut let me verify this by listing them out to be sure. Starting from -3:\n\n-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let me count them:\n\n1. -3\n2. -2\n3. -1\n4. 0\n5. 1\n6. 2\n7. 3\n8. 4\n9. 5\n10. 6\n11. 7\n\nYes, that's 11 integers. So the answer should be 11. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in determining the bounds.\n\nOriginal inequality: |x - 2| ≤ 5.6. So solving for x gives -3.6 ≤ x ≤ 7.6. So integers from -3 up to 7. Since -3.6 is between -4 and -3, the integers greater than or equal to -3.6 start at -3 because -3 is greater than -3.6. Similarly, 7.6 is between 7 and 8, so integers less than or equal to 7.6 go up to 7. Therefore, integers from -3 to 7 inclusive. Which is 11 integers as listed. \n\nBut let me check another way. Let me think of how many numbers there are between -3.6 and 7.6. If I convert this interval to integers, the lower bound is -3.6, which would include all integers greater than -3.6. Since integers are discrete, the first integer that satisfies x ≥ -3.6 is -3. Similarly, the upper bound is 7.6, so the last integer that satisfies x ≤ 7.6 is 7. So again, same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the number of integers by considering the distance from 2. The original absolute value inequality is |x - 2| ≤ 5.6, so x is within 5.6 units from 2. So starting at 2, moving 5.6 units to the left and right. So left side is 2 - 5.6 = -3.6, right side is 2 + 5.6 = 7.6. Same as before. \n\nBut maybe there's another way to think about how many integers are in that interval. For example, sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with non-integer bounds, you have to check if the endpoints are included. But since we are dealing with integers, and the original inequality is non-strict (≤), even though the endpoints -3.6 and 7.6 are not integers, the integers closest to them are included as long as they are within the interval.\n\nAnother way: Let me check if -3 is in the original solution set. Let's plug into |x - 2| ≤ 5.6:\n\n| -3 - 2 | = | -5 | = 5 ≤ 5.6? Yes, 5 is less than 5.6. Similarly, 7: |7 - 2| = |5| = 5 ≤ 5.6. Also yes. What about -4? Let me check if -4 is in the solution set. | -4 - 2 | = | -6 | = 6. 6 is greater than 5.6, so no. Similarly, 8: |8 - 2| = 6, which is also greater than 5.6, so no. Therefore, -4 and 8 are not in the solution set, so our bounds of -3 to 7 are correct for integers.\n\nSo the integers from -3 to 7 inclusive are indeed the ones in the solution set. And we already listed them and counted 11. Therefore, the answer is 11. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me recount the list:\n\nStarting at -3:\n\n-3 (1), -2 (2), -1 (3), 0 (4), 1 (5), 2 (6), 3 (7), 4 (8), 5 (9), 6 (10), 7 (11). Yep, 11 numbers. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the number of integers between two numbers, sometimes people make mistakes with off-by-one errors, so another way is to consider shifting the interval. For example, if we have numbers from a to b inclusive, how many numbers? Let me take a concrete example. If I have numbers from 1 to 5 inclusive, that's 5 numbers. Using the formula 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. Correct. Similarly, from 0 to 0, it's 1 number. So formula works. So applying the same logic here, from -3 to 7, difference is 7 - (-3) = 10, add 1, get 11. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think that since -3.6 is closer to -4, maybe they need to include -4? But we saw that when we plug in -4 into the original equation, it doesn't satisfy the inequality. So even though -4 is less than -3.6, it's not included. Therefore, only integers from -3 upwards. Similarly, 7.6 is closer to 8, but 8 is not included. So only up to 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11 integers. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me think about how many integers are there between -3.6 and 7.6. Since integers are discrete, each integer is 1 unit apart. So starting from -3, each subsequent integer is +1. Let me calculate the total number by subtracting the lower integer from the upper integer and adding 1. Upper integer is 7, lower is -3. So 7 - (-3) = 10. Then 10 + 1 = 11. Yep. \n\nAlternatively, if I convert the negative number to a positive count. Let me think: from -3 to 0, how many numbers? -3, -2, -1, 0. That's 4 numbers. From 0 to 7, that's 8 numbers (0 through 7 inclusive). But wait, if I add those together, 4 + 8 = 12, but that's double-counting 0. So actually, it's 4 - 1 = 3 numbers from -3 to -1, then 0, then 1 to 7. Let me try again:\n\nFrom -3 to 7 inclusive: the negative integers are -3, -2, -1. That's 3 numbers. Then 0. Then positive integers from 1 to 7. How many is that? 7 numbers. So total is 3 + 1 + 7 = 11. Yep, same result. So that's another way to think about it. So that confirms again that the total number is 11.\n\nTherefore, I feel confident that the number of integers in the solution set is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers in the solution set is \\boxed{11}.\n</think>"}
