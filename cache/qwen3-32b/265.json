So, the question is about an interaction term in the nucleon-pion Lagrangian that's proportional to the isospin matrix (τ_x + i τ_y). We need to determine which pion emission process this term facilitates. The options are A through D, each involving different combinations of protons, neutrons, and pions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic isospin concepts. Nucleons (protons and neutrons) form an isospin doublet. That means protons and neutrons are considered as two states of the same particle with different isospin components. The proton has isospin up (I₃ = +1/2) and the neutron isospin down (I₃ = -1/2). The pions form an isospin triplet: π⁺, π⁰, π⁻, corresponding to I₃ = +1, 0, -1 respectively.\n\nThe interaction term given is (τ_x + i τ_y). The τ matrices are the Pauli matrices acting on the nucleon isospin space. Let me write them out:\n\nτ_x (Pauli matrix σ_x) is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nτ_y (σ_y) is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nτ_z (σ_z) is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo, τ_x + i τ_y would be:\n\n[[0, 1], [1, 0]] + i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] \n\nLet me compute that. Multiply the i into the τ_y matrix:\n\ni * τ_y = i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0, -i²], [i², 0]] since i*(-i) = -i² and i*(i) = i². Remember that i² = -1, so:\n\n[[0, -(-1)], [(-1), 0]] = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]\n\nSo adding that to τ_x:\n\nOriginal τ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]] and the iτ_y we just found is [[0,1],[-1,0]]. Adding them together:\n\n[[0+0, 1+1], [1 + (-1), 0 + 0]] = [[0, 2], [0, 0]]? Wait, no. Wait:\n\nWait, let me recast that again. Wait, when I added τ_x and iτ_y:\n\nτ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and iτ_y is [[0,1],[-1,0]]? Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal τ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Multiply by i: i*τ_y is [[0, -i²], [i², 0]] which is [[0, -(-1)], [(-1), 0]] = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, τ_x + i τ_y is:\n\nτ_x + i τ_y = [[0,1],[1,0]] + [[0,1],[-1,0]] = [[0+0, 1+1], [1 + (-1), 0 + 0]] = [[0, 2], [0, 0]]? Wait, no:\n\nWait, matrix addition is element-wise. So:\n\nFirst row, first column: 0 (from τ_x) + 0 (from iτ_y) = 0\n\nFirst row, second column: 1 (from τ_x) + 1 (from iτ_y) = 2\n\nSecond row, first column: 1 (from τ_x) + (-1) (from iτ_y) = 0\n\nSecond row, second column: 0 (from τ_x) + 0 (from iτ_y) = 0\n\nTherefore, τ_x + i τ_y equals:\n\n[[0, 2],\n [0, 0]]\n\nBut actually, the Pauli matrices are usually multiplied by factors to match the isospin algebra. However, the exact numerical factors might not matter here because we are looking for the structure of the matrix.\n\nBut let me think. The matrix [[0, 2], [0, 0]] can be simplified. Since the Pauli matrices are usually normalized such that they have 2x2 matrices with entries involving 1, i, etc. However, the important thing here is the structure of the matrix. Let me note that τ_x + i τ_y is equivalent to 2 times the matrix [[0,1],[0,0]], which is actually the raising operator in isospin space. Because in angular momentum theory, the raising operator J_+ is J_x + i J_y, which raises the I₃ component by 1. Similarly, the lowering operator is J_x - i J_y.\n\nIn the context of isospin, the analogous operators would be τ_x ± i τ_y. So τ_x + i τ_y is the isospin raising operator, which would take a state with lower I₃ and raise it by 1 unit. For a doublet (nucleon), applying the raising operator would take the neutron (I₃ = -1/2) to the proton (I₃ = +1/2). But since the pion is being emitted, this interaction term would correspond to a process where the nucleon's isospin is raised by 1, and the pion carries away the corresponding isospin.\n\nBut pions are an isospin triplet, so their isospin is I=1. The pion states correspond to I₃ = +1 (π⁺), 0 (π⁰), -1 (π⁻). So if the interaction term is the raising operator, it would correspond to emitting a pion with I₃ = +1, because the total isospin should be conserved. Let me think.\n\nIn general, when you have an interaction term involving a matrix acting on the nucleon field and a pion field, the structure of the matrix corresponds to the isospin component of the pion. For example, if the interaction term is proportional to τ_z, it might correspond to a π⁰, because τ_z is diagonal and corresponds to the third component. Similarly, τ_x and τ_y would correspond to transitions between the two nucleon states, and combining them with i would give the raising/lowering operators.\n\nSince τ_x + i τ_y is the raising operator, which raises the isospin of the nucleon by 1. Therefore, if a nucleon emits a pion, the pion must carry away the corresponding isospin. So if the nucleon's isospin is raised by 1, then the pion must have I₃ = -1? Wait, because total isospin should be conserved. Let me think carefully.\n\nSuppose the initial nucleon has isospin I and I₃, and after emitting a pion, the final nucleon has I and I₃', and the pion has I=1 and I₃''. The interaction term is such that the matrix acting on the nucleon is the raising operator, so it would take the initial nucleon state and raise its I₃ by 1. Therefore, the pion must have I₃'' such that the total I₃ is conserved.\n\nLet me write an equation. Let’s assume that the interaction term is proportional to τ_+ = τ_x + i τ_y, which is the raising operator. So if the initial nucleon is in state |I, I₃⟩, then τ_+ |I, I₃⟩ = √[(I - I₃)(I + I₃ + 1)] |I, I₃ + 1⟩. For a doublet, I = 1/2, so τ_+ acting on the neutron (I₃ = -1/2) would give √[(1/2 - (-1/2))(1/2 + (-1/2) + 1)] |1/2, 1/2⟩ = √[(1)(1)] |proton⟩ = proton. Whereas acting on the proton (I₃ = +1/2), τ_+ would give zero because (I - I₃) = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.\n\nTherefore, this interaction term τ_+ would facilitate a transition from neutron to proton, provided that a pion with I₃ = -1 is emitted. Because initially, the neutron has I₃ = -1/2. After emitting a pion with I₃ = -1, the proton has I₃ = +1/2. Let's check conservation of I₃:\n\nInitial I₃: -1/2 (neutron)\nFinal I₃: +1/2 (proton) + (-1) (pion) = +1/2 -1 = -1/2. So yes, conserved.\n\nTherefore, the process would be neutron → proton + π⁻, which is option B. Alternatively, if the interaction term were the lowering operator τ_- = τ_x - i τ_y, it would lower the nucleon's I₃ by 1, requiring the pion to have I₃ = +1 (π⁺) to conserve I₃. For example, proton → neutron + π⁺, which would be option A.\n\nBut the given interaction term is τ_x + i τ_y, which is τ_+, so it's the raising operator. Therefore, the process should be neutron → proton + π⁻, which is option B. Let me check the options again:\n\nA: p → n + π+\n\nB: n → p + π-\n\nC: p → p + π0\n\nD: n → n + π0\n\nSo B is the candidate. Let me check if there are other possibilities. For example, could this interaction term allow a proton to emit a π⁰ and stay a proton? Let's see. If initial is proton (I₃ = +1/2), and the pion is π⁰ (I₃ = 0), then the final nucleon would need to have I₃ = +1/2 to conserve I₃. So if the interaction term allows that. But τ_+ acting on the proton (I₃ = +1/2) would give zero, because τ_+ is the raising operator and can't raise beyond +1/2. Therefore, the matrix element would be zero. Therefore, process C (p → p + π⁰) would not be allowed by this term. Similarly for D, neutron to neutron with π⁰: initial I₃ = -1/2, final I₃ = -1/2 + 0 = -1/2. But the interaction term τ_+ acting on the neutron would give a proton, so the matrix element would involve transitioning to a proton, not staying neutron. Therefore, D is also not allowed. So only B is possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n</think>"}
