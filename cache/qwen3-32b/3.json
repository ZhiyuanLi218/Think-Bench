First, I need to recall what 2-phenylpropene is. The name suggests it's a propene (which is CH2=CHCH3) with a phenyl group attached to the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2Ph)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH2? No, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The second carbon is the central one. So 2-phenylpropene would have the phenyl group attached to the second carbon of the propene. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The second carbon is the middle one. So if the phenyl group is on the second carbon, then it would be CH2=C(CH2Ph)CH3? Wait, no, maybe I should draw it mentally. Let me think again.\n\nPropene is CH2=CHCH3. The numbering is 1, 2, 3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The second carbon is C2. So 2-phenylpropene would have a phenyl group attached to C2. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3? Yes, that makes sense. So the molecule is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. Alternatively, maybe written as (C6H5)CH2CH=CH2? No, wait. The position of the phenyl group is on the second carbon. So the correct structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. Wait, but the IUPAC name for that would be 2-phenylpropene. Alternatively, maybe it's (E) or (Z) isomer, but maybe the question is not about that.\n\nNow, let's look at the options.\n\nOption A: Cannot decolorize dilute potassium permanganate solution. Potassium permanganate in acidic conditions is a strong oxidizing agent and can oxidize alkenes, causing the solution to decolorize. So if the compound has a double bond, it should decolorize KMnO4. 2-phenylpropene has a double bond, so it should decolorize KMnO4. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B: Can undergo addition polymerization reaction. Alkenes can undergo addition polymerization. Since 2-phenylpropene has a double bond, it can participate in polymerization. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: All atoms in the molecule are coplanar. In alkenes, the double bond creates a planar structure around the C=C. However, the presence of the phenyl group and other substituents might affect this. Let's think. The molecule is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The C2 is connected to a phenyl group and a CH3 group. The phenyl group is planar, and the double bond is planar. But the methyl group is on the same carbon. The geometry around the double bond is trigonal planar. However, the phenyl group is attached to the same carbon as the double bond. So the phenyl group's plane might be at an angle to the plane of the double bond. Unless there's conjugation. Wait, the phenyl group is attached to the C2 of the propene. The structure is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3. The phenyl is on the C2. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The phenyl is attached to C2. So the phenyl group is adjacent to the double bond. The C=C is planar, and the phenyl ring is also planar. However, whether they are in the same plane depends on the spatial arrangement. In some cases, like in styrene (which is phenyl乙烯, phenyl on the same position), the molecule isn't fully planar because the methyl group and the phenyl group are on different planes. Wait, styrene is CH2=CHC6H5. Its structure is similar to 2-phenylpropene? Wait, no. 2-phenylpropene is CH2=C(C6H5)CH3, whereas styrene is CH2=CHC6H5. So they are different. In styrene, the molecule has a planar double bond and a phenyl group. The phenyl group is attached to the double bond's carbon. The geometry allows for some conjugation, but not all atoms are coplanar. The methyl group in 2-phenylpropene is a CH3, which is a methyl group. The presence of the methyl group and the phenyl group on the same carbon would make it so that the molecule isn't entirely planar. So not all atoms are coplanar. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. So C is wrong.\n\nOption D: Easily soluble in water and toluene. Water solubility depends on the presence of polar groups. 2-phenylpropene is a hydrocarbon with a phenyl group and an alkene. It's not very polar, so it's likely not soluble in water. Toluene is a non-polar solvent, so it would be soluble in toluene. So statement D says \"easily soluble in water and toluene\", but since it's not soluble in water, D is incorrect. So D is wrong.\n\nSo the correct option is B.\n</think>"}
