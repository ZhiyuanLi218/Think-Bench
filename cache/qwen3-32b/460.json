Magnetic Force and Motion**\n\nThe magnetic force acting on a charged particle is given by the **Lorentz force law**:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ q $ is the charge of the particle (positive for a proton),\n- $ \\vec{v} $ is the velocity vector of the particle,\n- $ \\vec{B} $ is the magnetic field vector.\n\nThis force is **always perpendicular** to the velocity vector, and hence **does no work** on the particle. As a result, the **kinetic energy** of the particle is conserved.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Velocity Components and Path**\n\nThe proton enters the magnetic field at an angle of $ 30^\\circ $ to the magnetic field direction.

Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe problem says: A proton is traveling at an initial speed of 1.5 × 10^6 m/s and enters a region with a constant magnetic field of magnitude 1.5 T. The proton's initial velocity vector makes an angle of 30° with the magnetic field. I need to compute the proton's speed 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field. The options are given as A through D.\n\nAlright, so the key here is understanding how a magnetic field affects a moving charge, which in this case is a proton. I remember that the magnetic force on a moving charge is given by the Lorentz force law. The formula is F = q(v × B), where q is the charge, v is the velocity vector, and B is the magnetic field vector. The cross product means that the force is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field.\n\nNow, since the velocity is at an angle to the magnetic field, I should probably break the velocity into components that are parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. That makes sense because the magnetic force only acts on the component of velocity that's perpendicular to the magnetic field. The parallel component should remain unaffected because the cross product of parallel vectors is zero. So, the proton's motion will have two components: one that's circular due to the perpendicular component of velocity and one that's linear along the direction of the magnetic field. This should result in a helical path, right?\n\nBut wait, the question isn't asking about the path or the position after 4 seconds. It's asking about the speed. Hmm. So speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. If the magnetic field only exerts a force perpendicular to the velocity, then the force does no work on the proton because the force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the proton should remain constant, which would mean that the speed should remain constant. Is that correct?\n\nLet me think again. If the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity, then it can't change the magnitude of the velocity, only the direction. So yes, the speed should stay the same. But wait, the problem says the proton enters a region of constant magnetic field. Is there any other force acting on it? Assuming there's no electric field mentioned, only the magnetic field. Therefore, the proton's speed should not change over time. Therefore, after 4 seconds, the speed should still be the initial speed, which is 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. That would mean the answer is option C.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Let me recall: when a charged particle moves in a magnetic field, the magnetic force provides centripetal acceleration for the circular motion component. The perpendicular component of velocity causes circular motion with a radius r = (mv)/(qB), where m is mass, v is the perpendicular component of velocity. But the parallel component of velocity remains unchanged. Therefore, the total speed is the magnitude of the vector sum of the perpendicular and parallel components.\n\nBut since the magnetic force doesn't do work, the kinetic energy is conserved. Therefore, the speed can't change. So even though the direction of the velocity changes, the magnitude (speed) remains the same. Therefore, regardless of how long the proton is in the magnetic field, as long as there are no other forces or energy losses, the speed should remain 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem again. It says \"compute the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field.\" So unless there's something else going on here, like maybe the magnetic field is not uniform or there's an electric field? The problem states it's a constant magnetic field of magnitude 1.5 T. No electric field mentioned. So I think my reasoning holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that the velocity changes because of some acceleration? But acceleration here is centripetal, which only changes direction, not magnitude. Let me recall the formula for acceleration in magnetic field: a = (q v B sinθ)/m. Wait, but that's the magnitude of the acceleration. However, since this acceleration is perpendicular to velocity, it doesn't change the speed. So even though there is acceleration, it's only changing direction, not speed. Therefore, speed remains same. So answer is C.\n\nBut let me check if the angle is important here. The initial velocity makes 30 degrees with the magnetic field. So if I break the velocity into components, parallel and perpendicular. Let me calculate them. The parallel component is v_parallel = v_initial * cosθ, and perpendicular is v_perp = v_initial * sinθ. But since the magnetic field is constant, the parallel component remains as it is, and the perpendicular component causes circular motion. However, the speed is sqrt( (v_parallel)^2 + (v_perp)^2 ), which would be equal to the initial speed because that's how we break into components. Therefore, even though the direction of the perpendicular component changes over time (because it's going in circle), the magnitude of the velocity remains same. Therefore, the speed is still 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. So answer is C.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 4 seconds after entering. Is there a possibility that the proton might have lost some energy due to radiation? Wait, but in classical electrodynamics, an accelerating charge does emit electromagnetic radiation, which would cause energy loss. However, this is usually a very small effect unless the accelerations are extremely high. In most basic physics problems, this effect is neglected unless specified. Since the problem doesn't mention anything about energy loss or radiation, I think we are supposed to assume that the speed remains constant. Therefore, answer C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they mention the time to try to throw you off. Since in magnetic fields, the time doesn't affect the speed. So regardless of 4 seconds or 4 years, the speed is same. So answer is C.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A:5.0 × 10^6, B:7.5 × 10^6, C: same as initial, D:3.0 × 10^6. So answer is C. Therefore, I think the answer is C.\n\nBut let me just make sure that there isn't a case where the velocity changes. For example, if there was an electric field, then yes. But here, only magnetic field. So no. Also, magnetic force can't do work, so kinetic energy is conserved. Therefore, speed is same. So answer is C.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C:1.5 × 10^6 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
