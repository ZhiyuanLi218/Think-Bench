This is a classic scenario in **celestial mechanics**, and the key concept here is the **Hill sphere**.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Hill Sphere**\n\nThe **Hill sphere** defines the region around a planet where its gravity is strong enough to dominate over the gravitational pull of the central star. The radius of the Hill sphere, $ r_H $, is given by:\n\n$$\nr_H = a \\left( \\frac{M_{\\text{planet}}}{3M_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ a $ is the semi-major axis of the planet’s orbit around the star,\n- $ M_{\\text{planet}} $ is the mass of the planet,\n- $ M_{\\text{star}} $ is the mass of the star.\n\n---\n\n### **Given Values**\n\n- $ M_{\\text{planet}} = 2 M_{\\oplus} $\n- $ M_{\\text{star}} = 3 M_{\\odot} $\n- $ a = 2 \\, \\text{AU} $\n\nConvert $ M_{\\text{planet}} $ to solar masses:\n$$\nM_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{2}{333000} \\approx 6.006 \\times 10^{-6} M_{\\odot}\n$$\n\nNow compute the Hill radius:\n\n$$\nr_H = 2 \\left( \\frac{6.006 \\times 10^{-6}}{3 \\times 3} \\right)^{1/3} = 2 \\left( 6.673 \\times 10^{-7} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nEstimating the cube root:\n\n$$\n(6.673 \\times 10^{-7})^{1/3} \\approx 0.00874\n$$\n\n$$\nr_H \\approx 2 \\times 0.00874 = 0.01748 \\, \\text{AU}\n$$\n\nSo, the **Hill radius is approximately 0.0175 AU**.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow we compare the distances of the objects from the planet to this Hill radius:\n\n- **(a) 0.012 AU** → **Within** the Hill radius → Planet's gravity dominates.\n- **(b) 0.014 AU** → **Within** the Hill radius → Planet's gravity dominates.\n- **(c) 0.019 AU** → **Beyond** the Hill radius → Star's tidal forces dominate.\n- **(d) 0.021 AU** → **Beyond** the Hill radius → Star's tidal forces dominate.\n\n---\n\n### **Mass of the Object Does Not Matter**\n\nIt's important to note that the **mass of the object** (whether it's 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, or 0.006 Earth masses) does **not affect** the comparison between the gravitational force of the planet and the centrifugal (or tidal) force from the star.

I need to figure out which of the given objects have the planet's gravitational force exceeding the centrifugal force. Hmm, so the question is about comparing the gravitational force from the planet to the centrifugal force experienced by each object. \n\nFirst, I remember that in orbital mechanics, the centrifugal force is the apparent force that acts outward on a mass when it's rotating around a center. For an object orbiting a planet, the centrifugal force depends on the distance from the planet and the orbital velocity. But wait, actually, in this case, the planet itself is orbiting a star, so maybe the centrifugal force here refers to the centrifugal force due to the planet's own orbit around the star? Or is it the centrifugal force due to the object's orbit around the planet? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think.\n\nThe problem states that the gravitational force of the planet exceeds the centrifugal force. So, I think the centrifugal force here is the one that the object would experience if it were orbiting the planet. But since the planet is itself in orbit around a star, there might be a consideration of tidal forces or the Hill sphere. The Hill sphere is the region around a planet where its gravity dominates over the star's gravity. So maybe the question is about whether the object is within the planet's Hill sphere, where the planet's gravity is stronger than the star's tidal forces. But the centrifugal force is mentioned, so maybe it's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the centrifugal force here is the one due to the object's own orbit around the star, but that's not directly related to the planet. Wait, if the object is near the planet, then the gravitational force from the planet and the centrifugal force due to the star's gravitational pull might be in opposition. But perhaps the problem is simplifying this by considering the balance between the planet's gravity and the centrifugal force due to the object's orbit around the star. \n\nLet me recall the formula for the Hill sphere. The Hill radius is given by r_H = a * (m / (3M))^(1/3), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star, m is the mass of the planet, and M is the mass of the star. The Hill radius defines the region where the planet's gravity dominates over the star's. If an object is within this radius, the planet's gravity is stronger than the star's tidal forces. So maybe the centrifugal force here is related to the star's gravitational influence, and the question is essentially asking which objects are within the planet's Hill sphere.\n\nLet me check the given data. The planet has a mass of 2 Earth masses, the star has 3 solar masses, and the planet's orbital distance is 2 AU. Let's calculate the Hill radius for this planet.\n\nFirst, convert the masses into the same units. Let's use solar masses. The star's mass M = 3 M_sun. The planet's mass m = 2 M_earth. But 1 M_sun is about 333,000 M_earth, so m = 2 / 333,000 ≈ 6.006 × 10^-6 M_sun.\n\nThe Hill radius formula is r_H = a * (m / (3M))^(1/3). Plugging in the numbers:\n\na = 2 AU\n\nm / (3M) = (6.006 × 10^-6 M_sun) / (3 * 3 M_sun) = 6.006 × 10^-6 / 9 ≈ 6.673 × 10^-7\n\nThen take the cube root of that: (6.673 × 10^-7)^(1/3). Let me calculate that. The cube root of 6.673 × 10^-7. Let's approximate.\n\nCube root of 10^-6 is 10^-2, so 10^-6 is 1e-6, cube root is 1e-2. Our value is about 6.673 × 10^-7, which is roughly 6.67 × 1e-7. So cube root of 6.67 × 1e-7 is cube root of 6.67 times cube root of 1e-7. Cube root of 6.67 is about 1.88, and cube root of 1e-7 is 1e-7^(1/3) = 1e-7^(1/3) = 1e-7^(0.333) ≈ 1e-2.333 ≈ 1e-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3. Wait, maybe I need to recalculate that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use logarithms. Let me do that.\n\nLet me compute (6.673 × 10^-7)^(1/3). Let me take natural logs. ln(6.673 × 10^-7) = ln(6.673) + ln(10^-7) ≈ 1.90 - 16.12 = -14.22. Divided by 3 is -4.74. Exponentiate: e^(-4.74) ≈ 0.0085. So the cube root is approximately 0.0085. Therefore, r_H ≈ 2 AU * 0.0085 ≈ 0.017 AU. So the Hill radius is approximately 0.017 AU. Therefore, any object within 0.017 AU from the planet would be within its Hill sphere, meaning the planet's gravity dominates over the star's tidal forces. So if the object is within this distance, the planet's gravitational force exceeds the star's tidal forces (which might be considered as the centrifugal force in this context).\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\na) 0.012 AU from the planet. That's less than 0.017 AU, so within Hill radius. So gravitational force of planet dominates.\n\nb) 0.014 AU. Also less than 0.017. So same as a, within Hill radius.\n\nc) 0.019 AU. That's more than 0.017, so outside Hill radius. So the star's tidal force (or centrifugal force) would dominate.\n\nd) 0.021 AU. Also more than 0.017, so outside.\n\nBut the options are a, b, c, d. The question is which of these objects have the planet's gravitational force exceed the centrifugal force. According to this, a and b are within Hill radius, so the planet's gravity dominates. The answer would be a and b, which is option B. But wait, the options given in the problem are:\n\nA: a and c\n\nB: a and b \n\nC: c and d\n\nD: b and d\n\nBut according to my calculation, the Hill radius is ~0.017 AU, so a (0.012) and b (0.014) are within, c and d are outside. So the correct answer would be B: a and b. But wait, let me check my calculation again because maybe I made an error in computing the Hill radius.\n\nWait, the Hill radius formula is r_H = a * (m / (3M))^(1/3). Let me plug in the numbers again carefully.\n\nGiven:\n\na = 2 AU\n\nm = 2 M_earth\n\nM = 3 M_sun\n\nBut to compute m / (3M), we need m and M in the same units. Let me convert m to solar masses. 1 M_sun ≈ 333,000 M_earth, so 2 M_earth = 2 / 333,000 ≈ 6.006 × 10^-6 M_sun.\n\nThen, m / (3M) = (6.006 × 10^-6) / (3 * 3) = 6.006 × 10^-6 / 9 ≈ 6.673 × 10^-7.\n\nSo cube root of that is (6.673 × 10^-7)^(1/3). Let me compute this more accurately. Let me take 6.673 × 10^-7 = 6.673e-7.\n\nLet me compute 6.673e-7^(1/3). Let me note that 1e-6^(1/3) is 1e-2 = 0.01. Since 6.673e-7 is 0.6673e-6, which is about 2/3 of 1e-6. The cube root of 0.667 is approximately 0.874 (since 0.874^3 ≈ 0.667). Therefore, cube root of 0.667e-6 is 0.874 * 1e-2 = 0.00874. Therefore, r_H = 2 AU * 0.00874 ≈ 0.01748 AU. So approximately 0.0175 AU. So the Hill radius is about 0.0175 AU. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\na) 0.012 AU < 0.0175 AU → within\n\nb) 0.014 AU < 0.0175 → within\n\nc) 0.019 AU > 0.0175 → outside\n\nd) 0.021 AU > 0.0175 → outside\n\nSo the correct answer would be B: a and b. But wait, the options given are:\n\nA: a and c\n\nB: a and b \n\nC: c and d\n\nD: b and d\n\nSo B is the correct choice. But wait, the problem mentions \"gravitational force of the planet exceed the centrifugal force\". So maybe the Hill sphere is the correct approach here. Therefore, the answer is B. However, the options given in the problem include B as an option. But let me check again if I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, the Hill radius is the distance from the planet where the planet's gravity is equal to the tidal forces from the star. So objects inside the Hill sphere are gravitationally bound to the planet. Therefore, the gravitational force of the planet exceeds the tidal forces (which might be considered as centrifugal force in the rotating frame). Therefore, the answer is B: a and b.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"gravitational force of the planet exceed the centrifugal force\". So maybe it's not the Hill radius but a direct comparison between the gravitational force from the planet and the centrifugal force due to the object's orbit around the star. Wait, that's a different approach.\n\nLet me try this approach. The centrifugal force experienced by the object due to its orbit around the star would be F_c = m_obj * ω^2 * r, where ω is the angular velocity of the planet (since the object is presumably orbiting the star at the same distance as the planet, so same ω). The gravitational force from the planet on the object is F_grav = G * M_planet * m_obj / d^2, where d is the distance between the object and the planet.\n\nWe need to compare F_grav and F_c. If F_grav > F_c, then the planet's gravity dominates.\n\nLet me write the condition:\n\nG * M_planet * m_obj / d^2 > m_obj * ω^2 * r\n\nThe m_obj cancels out:\n\nG * M_planet / d^2 > ω^2 * r\n\nBut ω is the angular velocity of the planet around the star. From Kepler's third law, ω^2 = G * M_star / a^3, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (2 AU). So substituting:\n\nG * M_planet / d^2 > (G * M_star / a^3) * r\n\nCancel G:\n\nM_planet / d^2 > (M_star / a^3) * r\n\nRearranging:\n\nM_planet / M_star > (r * d^2) / a^3\n\nBut this seems complicated. Wait, maybe we can express r in terms of a. If the object is at a distance d from the planet, and assuming the planet is at distance a from the star, then the distance from the object to the star is approximately a ± d, depending on the direction. But if d is much smaller than a, then the distance from the object to the star is approximately a, so r ≈ a. Therefore, the centrifugal force is F_c ≈ m_obj * ω^2 * a.\n\nSo the condition becomes:\n\nG * M_planet / d^2 > m_obj * ω^2 * a\n\nWait, but earlier we had:\n\nG * M_planet / d^2 > ω^2 * r * m_obj\n\nBut since m_obj cancels out, and r ≈ a:\n\nG * M_planet / d^2 > ω^2 * a\n\nThen ω^2 = G * M_star / a^3\n\nSo substituting:\n\nG * M_planet / d^2 > (G * M_star / a^3) * a = G * M_star / a^2\n\nCancel G:\n\nM_planet / d^2 > M_star / a^2\n\nRearranged:\n\nM_planet / M_star > (d / a)^2\n\nWait, but this would lead to:\n\nd < a * sqrt(M_planet / M_star)\n\nBut let's compute this. Given:\n\nM_planet = 2 M_earth\n\nM_star = 3 M_sun\n\nBut we need to express M_planet and M_star in the same units. Let's convert M_planet to solar masses:\n\nM_planet = 2 M_earth ≈ 2 / 333,000 ≈ 6.006 × 10^-6 M_sun\n\nSo M_planet / M_star = 6.006 × 10^-6 / 3 ≈ 2.002 × 10^-6\n\nThen d < a * sqrt(2.002 × 10^-6) ≈ 2 AU * sqrt(2e-6) ≈ 2 * 1.414e-3 ≈ 2.828e-3 AU ≈ 0.0028 AU\n\nBut this is way smaller than the Hill radius we calculated earlier (0.0175 AU). This suggests that this approach is leading to a much smaller distance, which contradicts the Hill sphere calculation. So I must have made a mistake here. Let me check my steps again.\n\nThe problem is in the assumption that the centrifugal force is m_obj * ω^2 * a. Wait, actually, the centrifugal force on the object due to its orbit around the star would be F_c = m_obj * ω^2 * r_obj, where r_obj is the distance from the object to the star. But if the object is near the planet, r_obj ≈ a ± d. However, if the object is in the vicinity of the planet, then the gravitational force from the planet and the centrifugal force from the star's gravity are both acting on the object. To determine whether the planet's gravity dominates, we need to compare the gravitational acceleration from the planet to the tidal acceleration from the star.\n\nThe tidal acceleration is the difference in gravitational acceleration from the star at the planet's location and at the object's location. This is approximately d * dF/dr, where F is the gravitational acceleration from the star. The gravitational acceleration from the star at distance a is F_star = G*M_star/a². The derivative dF/dr is -2G*M_star/a³. Therefore, the tidal acceleration is approximately -2G*M_star/a³ * d. The magnitude is 2G*M_star/a³ * d.\n\nSo the condition for the planet's gravity to dominate over the tidal forces is:\n\nG*M_planet/d² > 2G*M_star/a³ * d\n\nCancel G:\n\nM_planet / d² > 2*M_star / a³ * d\n\nRearranged:\n\nM_planet / M_star > 2*d³ / a³\n\nSo:\n\nd³ / a³ < M_planet / (2*M_star)\n\nTherefore:\n\nd < a * [M_planet / (2*M_star)]^(1/3)\n\nThis is similar to the Hill sphere formula but with a factor of 2 in the denominator. The Hill radius is usually defined as:\n\nr_H = a * (M_planet / (3*M_star))^(1/3)\n\nWhich is very similar to what we derived here, but with a factor of 3 instead of 2. This discrepancy is because the Hill sphere is derived from a more precise calculation considering the restricted three-body problem, and it includes the factor of 3. So our earlier Hill sphere calculation is more accurate for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, using the Hill radius formula is the correct approach. Hence, the Hill radius is approximately 0.0175 AU, so any object within that distance from the planet is within its Hill sphere, meaning the planet's gravity dominates over the star's tidal forces. Therefore, options a (0.012 AU) and b (0.014 AU) are within the Hill radius, while c (0.019 AU) and d (0.021 AU) are outside. Therefore, the correct answer is B: a and b.\n\nBut wait, the options given in the problem are:\n\nA: a and c\n\nB: a and b \n\nC: c and d\n\nD: b and d\n\nSo B is the correct answer. However, I need to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the Hill radius. Let me recalculate the Hill radius step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\na = 2 AU\n\nM_planet = 2 M_earth\n\nM_star = 3 M_sun\n\nConvert M_planet to M_sun:\n\n1 M_sun = 333,000 M_earth → M_planet = 2 / 333,000 ≈ 6.006 × 10^-6 M_sun\n\nHill radius formula:\n\nr_H = a * (M_planet / (3*M_star))^(1/3)\n\nSo:\n\nM_planet / (3*M_star) = (6.006 × 10^-6) / (3*3) = 6.006 × 10^-6 / 9 ≈ 6.673 × 10^-7\n\nTake cube root:\n\n(6.673 × 10^-7)^(1/3). Let's compute this.\n\nWe can write 6.673 × 10^-7 = 6.673 × 10^-7 = 6.673e-7.\n\nWe know that (1e-6)^(1/3) = 1e-2 = 0.01. Since 6.673e-7 is 0.6673e-6, which is 2/3 of 1e-6. The cube root of 0.6673 is approximately 0.874 (since 0.874^3 ≈ 0.667). Therefore, cube root of 0.6673e-6 is 0.874 × 1e-2 = 0.00874.\n\nThus, r_H = 2 AU × 0.00874 ≈ 0.01748 AU ≈ 0.0175 AU. So yes, the Hill radius is approximately 0.0175 AU. Therefore, objects at 0.012 AU (a), 0.014 AU (b) are within, and 0.019 and 0.021 are outside. Hence, answer B.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions the centrifugal force specifically. Is the Hill sphere approach equivalent to comparing gravitational force and centrifugal force? In the rotating frame of reference where the planet is stationary, the effective potential includes both the gravitational potential from the star and the centrifugal potential. The Hill sphere is the region around the planet where the effective potential is dominated by the planet's gravity. So yes, in that context, the centrifugal force is part of the effective potential, so comparing the planet's gravity to the centrifugal force (and tidal forces) leads to the Hill radius. Therefore, the Hill sphere approach is valid here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: a and b. However, let me check if the options in the problem are different. The problem says:\n\nA: a and c\n\nB: a and b \n\nC: c and d\n\nD: b and d\n\nYes, so B is the correct choice. However, I need to check if there's another consideration. For example, maybe the mass of the object affects the result? The question mentions objects with different masses. Wait, but in the Hill sphere calculation, the mass of the object doesn't matter because it cancels out when comparing forces. The Hill sphere is independent of the object's mass. Similarly, in the earlier derivation, the object's mass cancels out. Therefore, the answer should only depend on the distance from the planet, not on the object's mass. Therefore, regardless of the object's mass (as given in options a-d), the critical factor is the distance from the planet. All objects at the same distance would have the same comparison between the planet's gravity and the centrifugal force (or tidal forces). Therefore, the correct answer is B: a and b.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options have different masses, but according to the Hill sphere, mass of the object doesn't matter. For example, option a has 0.002 Earth masses, option b has 0.006, etc. But since the gravitational force from the planet and the centrifugal force both scale with the object's mass, they cancel out. So the result is independent of the object's mass. Therefore, the answer is purely based on distance. Hence, a and b are within Hill radius, so answer B.\n</think>"}
