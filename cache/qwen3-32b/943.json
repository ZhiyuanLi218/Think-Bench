The question is about the relationship between an RNA oligo synthesized in the lab and a naturally occurring one, given the synthetic steps described. The answer options are diastereoisomers, regioisomers, constitutional isomers but not regioisomers, or identical.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the synthesis steps. The chemist starts with a β-D-ribo nucleoside. The first step is installing a DMTr protecting group on the 5'-OH. Then, they treat the 5’-ODMTr ribonucleoside with 1.1 eq of TBDMSCl, which forms two products, 1 and 2. The key here is the TBDMSCl reaction. TBDMSCl is tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, which is a silyl protecting group. So this step is likely protecting the hydroxyl groups on the ribose sugar.\n\nBut why does this reaction form two products? TBDMSCl usually adds to a hydroxyl group. If there are multiple hydroxyls on the ribose sugar, maybe the silyl group is adding to different positions, leading to different products. Let's recall the structure of a ribonucleoside. The ribose sugar has hydroxyls on C1', C2', C3', and C4'. The C1' is the anomeric carbon (since it's a nucleoside, the base is attached here), and the C2', C3', and C4' have hydroxyls. \n\nThe starting material is a β-D-ribonucleoside, so the configuration at C1' is fixed (β configuration). The DMTr group is on the 5'-OH, so that's already protected. Now, the remaining hydroxyls are at 2', 3', and 4'. But in RNA, the 3' and 2' hydroxyls are present, and the 4' is also a hydroxyl. However, the 4' hydroxyl is adjacent to the C3' and C5' (since the sugar is a five-membered ring). \n\nWhen adding TBDMSCl, if there are multiple hydroxyls available, the silyl group can add to different positions. But with 1.1 equivalents, maybe it's adding to one position. However, the fact that two products are formed suggests that the silyl group can add to two different positions. For example, maybe the 2' and 3' positions, leading to two different silylated products. \n\nThe problem states that two products are formed. The chemist isolates product 1 and discards product 2. The key is understanding the difference between product 1 and product 2, and how that affects the final RNA oligo.\n\nNow, looking at the 2D COSY NMR spectrum of product 1. The correlations mentioned are between a 1H doublet at 6 ppm (Ha), a 1H doublet-of-doublets at 4.5 ppm (Hb), and a broad singlet at 5.5 ppm. Also, Hb correlates with another 1H doublet-of-doublets at 4.5 ppm (Hc). \n\nLet me think about the ribose sugar structure. The hydroxyls on 2', 3', and 4' are each on adjacent carbons. The protons adjacent to these hydroxyls would be the protons on the same carbon or neighboring carbons. For example, the 2'-OH would be adjacent to the H2' proton, and the 3'-OH adjacent to H3', etc. However, when a hydroxyl is silylated, the proton on that carbon might shift. \n\nBut the COSY spectrum shows correlations between protons that are coupled. The key here is to figure out which protons are being observed. The Ha at 6 ppm is a doublet. That might be an aromatic proton from the DMTr group. DMTr is dimethoxytrityl, which has aromatic protons. However, the question is about the ribose protons. Maybe Ha is a proton on the ribose sugar. \n\nWait, in RNA, the protons on the ribose sugar have specific chemical shifts. The H1' is usually around 4.5-5 ppm, H2' around 3.5-4.5 ppm, H3' around 3.5-4.5 ppm, H4' around 3.5-4.5 ppm, and H5' and H5'' around 1.5-2 ppm. But the DMTr group is on the 5' position, so maybe the H5' and H5'' are affected. \n\nBut the problem mentions a Ha at 6 ppm, which is more typical of aromatic protons. So maybe that's the DMTr's aromatic protons. However, the question is about the ribose protons. The other signals are at 4.5 ppm (Hb and Hc) and a broad singlet at 5.5 ppm. \n\nThe broad singlet at 5.5 ppm might be an exchangeable proton, like an OH group. But in the COSY, there's a correlation between Hb and this broad singlet. Since COSY shows correlations between protons that are coupled, if Hb is coupled to an OH proton, that would make sense. But OH protons are usually broad and don't show coupling in NMR. However, if the OH is part of a silyl ether, maybe the proton is not exchangeable? Wait, TBDMSCl adds to the OH to form a silyl ether. So if the hydroxyl is protected by TBS (tert-butyldimethylsilyl), then the proton on that carbon might be shielded and have a different chemical shift. \n\nWait, but the product has a TBS group. So the TBS is on one of the hydroxyls. The presence of two products suggests that the TBS could be on two different positions. Let's suppose product 1 has the TBS on the 2' hydroxyl, and product 2 on the 3' hydroxyl. Then, the COSY data would help determine which product is which. \n\nThe correlations in product 1's COSY: Ha (6 ppm doublet) correlates with Hb (4.5 ppm doublet of doublets), which correlates with a broad singlet at 5.5 ppm and another Hc (4.5 ppm doublet of doublets). \n\nIf Ha is an aromatic proton from DMTr, then Hb and Hc might be protons on the ribose. Let's consider the ribose protons. Suppose Hb is H2' and Hc is H3'. If the TBS is on the 2' hydroxyl, then the H2' proton would be adjacent to the TBS group, which is a bulky group. The chemical shift might be affected. Alternatively, if the TBS is on the 3' hydroxyl, then H3' would be adjacent to the TBS. \n\nThe broad singlet at 5.5 ppm could be a hydroxyl proton that's not protected. If product 1 has the TBS on the 2' hydroxyl, then the 3' and 4' hydroxyls are still free. The 3' OH would have a proton that could exchange, leading to a broad signal. The coupling between Hb (say, H2') and the 3' OH would indicate that Hb is adjacent to the 3' OH. \n\nIf Hb is H2', then it would couple with H3', and if the 3' OH is adjacent to H3', there might be some coupling. However, the OH protons are usually not coupled because they exchange rapidly. But if the OH is not protected (i.e., still present), maybe there's some residual coupling. \n\nAlternatively, the broad singlet at 5.5 ppm could be the H1' proton. Wait, H1' in a ribose sugar is around 4.5-5 ppm. If there's a broad singlet at 5.5 ppm, maybe that's H1' with some coupling. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to think of the possible positions of the TBS group. The starting material is a β-D-ribo nucleoside with DMTr on 5'. The remaining hydroxyls are at 2', 3', and 4'. TBDMSCl can protect one of these. If the reaction forms two products, it's likely that the TBS is on two different positions. \n\nIn RNA synthesis, typically, the 2'-OH is protected with a silyl group like TBS, because in DNA, the 2'-OH is absent. But in RNA, the 2'-OH is present and can participate in reactions. However, during phosphoramidite synthesis, the 5'-OH is protected (as DMTr here), and the 3'-OH is left free for the phosphitylation step. Wait, but in the problem, after protecting the 5'-OH with DMTr, they add TBDMSCl. If they are making a phosphoramidite for solid-phase synthesis, typically the 5'-OH is protected, and the 3'-OH is used for chain elongation. However, in this case, after adding TBDMSCl, maybe they are protecting the 2' or 3' hydroxyls to prevent unwanted reactions.\n\nBut the problem states that two products are formed. If TBDMSCl is adding to the 2' and 3' positions, then product 1 and product 2 would be the 2'-O-TBS and 3'-O-TBS derivatives. The chemist isolates product 1 and proceeds with it. The key is to determine whether product 1 has the TBS on the 2' or 3' position based on the COSY data.\n\nLooking at the COSY correlations again. If Ha is an aromatic proton (from DMTr), then Hb and Hc are protons on the ribose. Let's consider the 2' and 3' protons. In the ribose sugar, the H2' and H3' protons are adjacent to each other. Their chemical shifts and coupling patterns can help distinguish them. \n\nIn a β-D-ribose, the H2' is usually a doublet of doublets because it's coupled to H1' and H3'. Similarly, H3' is a doublet of doublets coupled to H2' and H4'. The H1' is a multiplet, and the H4' is a triplet or doublet depending on the neighboring protons.\n\nIf product 1 has the TBS on the 2' hydroxyl, then the H2' proton would be adjacent to the TBS group. The TBS is a bulky group, so the H2' proton might be shifted downfield. Similarly, if the TBS is on the 3' hydroxyl, the H3' proton would be affected.\n\nThe COSY data shows a correlation between Ha (6 ppm) and Hb (4.5 ppm doublet of doublets). Assuming Ha is DMTr aromatic protons, which are usually around 7 ppm, but 6 ppm is a bit upfield. Maybe it's a proton on the ribose? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the TBS group's protons? TBS has methyl groups, but those are usually around 0.0-0.5 ppm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ha is the H1' proton. If H1' is at 4.5-5 ppm, but the problem says 6 ppm. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check typical chemical shifts. \n\nThe H1' in a ribose nucleoside is usually around 4.5-5.0 ppm. A broad singlet at 5.5 ppm could be an OH proton. The H2' and H3' protons are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So if Hb and Hc are at 4.5 ppm, they could be H2' and H3'. \n\nIf the TBS is on the 2' hydroxyl, then the H2' proton would be adjacent to the TBS group. The coupling between H2' and H3' would still be present. The correlation between Hb (H2') and the broad singlet (probably H3' OH) would make sense if the OH is on the 3' position. Similarly, if the TBS is on the 3' hydroxyl, then the H3' proton would be adjacent to TBS, and the H2' OH would be the broad singlet. \n\nSo, if product 1 has TBS on the 2', then the H2' is protected, and the H3' OH is free (broad singlet). The COSY correlation between Hb (H2') and the broad singlet (H3' OH) would exist. Similarly, if product 1 has TBS on the 3', then the H3' is protected, and the H2' OH is free. But in that case, the correlation between Hb (H3') and the broad singlet (H2' OH) would exist. \n\nThe problem states that in product 1, there is a correlation between Hb and another Hc at 4.5 ppm. If Hb is H2' and Hc is H3', then the coupling between them would be present. Similarly, if Hb is H3' and Hc is H2', same thing. \n\nThe key is whether the TBS is on the 2' or 3'. If the chemist proceeds with product 1, which has TBS on the 2', then during the phosphoramidite synthesis, the 3' OH would be free (since the TBS is on 2'), allowing it to be phosphitylated. If the TBS were on the 3', then the 3' OH would be protected and not available for phosphitylation. \n\nIn standard RNA phosphoramidite synthesis, the 5'-OH is protected, and the 3'-OH is used for the phosphitylation step to form the phosphodiester linkage during solid-phase synthesis. Therefore, if product 1 has the TBS on the 2', then the 3' OH is free and can be phosphitylated. If product 2 had the TBS on the 3', then the 3' OH is protected, making it unsuitable for phosphitylation, which is why the chemist discards product 2. \n\nTherefore, product 1 is the 2'-O-TBS protected nucleoside, allowing the 3' OH to be used for the phosphoramidite. \n\nNow, moving on to the final step: treating product 1 with 2-cyanoethyl N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphoramidite. This would phosphitylate the free 3' OH, forming the phosphoramidite. \n\nThe question is about the relationship between the synthetic RNA oligo and a naturally occurring one with the same bases and sequence. The difference would be in the stereochemistry of the ribose sugar. \n\nIn naturally occurring RNA, the sugar is β-D-ribose, with the hydroxyls on the 2', 3', and 5' positions. In the synthetic process, the chemist is protecting the 5' OH with DMTr, the 2' OH with TBS, and then phosphitylating the 3' OH. However, the key is whether the configuration at the 2' and 3' positions is the same as in natural RNA. \n\nWait, the starting material is a β-D-ribo nucleoside. The β configuration refers to the anomeric carbon (C1'). The hydroxyls on C2', C3', and C4' have specific configurations. In D-ribose, the hydroxyl on C2' is on the same face as the C1' hydroxyl (since it's a D-sugar). However, during the synthesis, the TBS is added to the 2' hydroxyl. The TBS is a protecting group, but the stereochemistry at the 2' carbon is already determined by the starting material. \n\nIn natural RNA, the 2' hydroxyl is in the β configuration (same as the anomeric center). When the TBS is added to the 2' hydroxyl, the configuration at the 2' carbon remains the same as in the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry at the 2' and 3' positions is preserved. \n\nHowever, during the phosphitylation step, the 3' hydroxyl is converted into a phosphoramidite. The phosphoramidite is used in solid-phase synthesis to form the phosphodiester linkages. The stereochemistry of the phosphodiester linkage in natural RNA is 5'-3' with a specific geometry (the phosphate is between the 5' and 3' positions). The synthetic phosphoramidite would form the same linkage during the coupling step. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the relationship between the synthetic RNA and the natural one. The synthetic RNA would have the same sequence and bases, but any differences in the sugar structure. \n\nThe key is whether the protecting groups affect the final structure. The DMTr group is on the 5' end and would be removed during the deprotection step. The TBS on the 2' would also be removed. The phosphoramidite group is also removed during the deprotection. Therefore, the final RNA oligo would have the same sugar structure as natural RNA: β-D-ribose with 2', 3', and 5' hydroxyls. \n\nBut wait, in the synthetic process, the 2' hydroxyl was protected with TBS. When the protecting groups are removed, the 2' hydroxyl is restored. Therefore, the final RNA oligo would have the same configuration at all chiral centers as the natural one. \n\nHowever, there's a possibility that during the silylation step, if the TBS was added to a different position (like the 3' instead of the 2'), it could lead to a different stereochemistry. But the chemist isolated product 1, which we determined is the 2'-O-TBS protected nucleoside. Therefore, the configuration at the 2' and 3' positions remains as in the natural RNA. \n\nThus, the synthetic RNA would be identical to the natural one because all the protecting groups are removed, and the stereochemistry is preserved. Therefore, the answer should be D: Identical. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The problem mentions that the starting material is a β-D-ribo nucleoside. The TBS is added to the 2' OH, which doesn't change the stereochemistry. The phosphoramidite is added to the 3' OH, which is part of the natural structure. So when the phosphoramidite is used in the synthesis, the 3' OH is used to form the phosphodiester bond. The final RNA would have the same sugar structure as natural RNA. \n\nTherefore, the synthetic RNA and the natural RNA would be identical. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
