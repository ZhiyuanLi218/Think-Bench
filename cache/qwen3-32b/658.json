The total potential difference $ V $ between the inner and outer spheres is the sum of the potential drops across each of the three regions. Since the electric field in a spherical capacitor is radial and the charge $ Q $ is constant across all regions, the total capacitance can be found by integrating the electric field across the full radial extent from $ a $ to $ d $, and then using the definition $ C = Q/V $.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the system as three capacitors in series, each corresponding to one of the three regions.

Let me try to visualize this. There's an inner sphere of radius a and an outer sphere of radius d. Between them, there are three regions: from a to b, there's a dielectric with relative permittivity K₁; from b to c, it's vacuum (so relative permittivity is 1); and from c to d, another dielectric with K₂. The outer sphere is grounded, and the inner sphere is at potential V. \n\nFirst, I remember that for capacitors, especially spherical ones, capacitance usually involves the formula for concentric spheres. The basic formula for a spherical capacitor with vacuum between the spheres is C = 4πε₀ * (a*b)/(b - a), right? But here, we have three different regions with different materials. Since the materials are in series between the two spheres, maybe I can model this as three capacitors in series? Each region (a-b, b-c, c-d) would act like a capacitor in series. \n\nBut wait, in a spherical capacitor, the capacitance depends on the radii of the spheres and the dielectric material between them. If there are multiple dielectrics in between, they are indeed in series, so the total capacitance would be the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals, similar to resistors in series. \n\nSo let me recall: for capacitors in series, 1/C_total = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃. Therefore, if I can find the capacitance of each individual region, I can add them up accordingly. \n\nLet me try to write down the capacitance for each region. \n\nFirst region: from a to b with dielectric K₁. The formula for a spherical capacitor with dielectric is similar to vacuum, but with ε₀ replaced by ε₀*K. So, for a spherical shell with inner radius r₁ and outer radius r₂, filled with dielectric of permittivity ε, the capacitance is C = 4πε * (r₁*r₂)/(r₂ - r₁). \n\nTherefore, for the first region between a and b with K₁, the capacitance C₁ would be 4πε₀K₁*(a*b)/(b - a). \n\nSecond region: from b to c, vacuum. So K = 1, so C₂ = 4πε₀*(b*c)/(c - b). \n\nThird region: from c to d with dielectric K₂. Similarly, C₃ = 4πε₀K₂*(c*d)/(d - c). \n\nSince these three capacitors are in series, the total capacitance C_total is given by 1/C_total = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃. \n\nTherefore, I need to compute each 1/C term and sum them up, then take reciprocal. \n\nBut let me check if this approach is correct. \n\nWait, in a spherical capacitor, the electric field is radial, and for each dielectric layer, the electric field would depend on the charge and the radius. Also, since they are in series, the charge on each capacitor would be the same. The potential difference across each region would add up to the total potential difference between the inner and outer sphere. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the method of calculating the electric field in each region, integrate to find the total potential difference, and then use C = Q/V. \n\nLet me try that approach as well, to verify. \n\nLet me suppose that the inner sphere has charge +Q, and the outer sphere has charge -Q. Since the outer sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. \n\nIn the region a < r < b, filled with dielectric K₁. The electric field in a dielectric for a spherical shell is E = Q_enc / (4πεr²). But since there is a dielectric, the electric field is E = Q_enc / (4πεr²) = Q_enc / (4πε₀K₁ r²). \n\nSimilarly, in the vacuum region b < r < c, E = Q_enc / (4πε₀ r²). \n\nIn the region c < r < d, filled with dielectric K₂, E = Q_enc / (4πε₀K₂ r²). \n\nThen, the potential difference between the inner and outer sphere is the integral of E dr from a to d. \n\nBut since there are discontinuities at b and c, I need to split the integral into three parts: from a to b, b to c, and c to d. \n\nSo, V = V_a - V_d = V_a - 0 = V. \n\nCalculating V:\n\nV = ∫(from a to b) E₁ dr + ∫(from b to c) E₂ dr + ∫(from c to d) E₃ dr \n\nEach integral can be computed as follows:\n\nFirst integral: ∫(a to b) [Q / (4πε₀K₁ r²)] dr \n\nWhich is Q/(4πε₀K₁) ∫(a to b) dr / r² = Q/(4πε₀K₁) [ -1/r ] from a to b = Q/(4πε₀K₁) [ -1/b + 1/a ] = Q/(4πε₀K₁) [ (a - b)/(ab) ) ] = Q/(4πε₀K₁) * (b - a)/ab ??? Wait:\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\n[ -1/r ] from a to b is (-1/b) - (-1/a) = 1/a - 1/b. \n\nTherefore, first integral is Q/(4πε₀K₁) * (1/a - 1/b). \n\nSimilarly, second integral: ∫(b to c) [Q/(4πε₀ r²)] dr = Q/(4πε₀) [1/b - 1/c]. \n\nThird integral: ∫(c to d) [Q/(4πε₀K₂ r²)] dr = Q/(4πε₀K₂) [1/c - 1/d]. \n\nTherefore, total V is:\n\nV = Q/(4πε₀) [ (1/(K₁))(1/a - 1/b) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂))(1/c - 1/d) ] \n\nTherefore, solving for Q:\n\nQ = V / [ (1/(4πε₀)) ( (1/(K₁))(1/a - 1/b) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂))(1/c - 1/d) ) ]\n\nTherefore, capacitance C = Q/V = 4πε₀ / [ (1/(K₁))(1/a - 1/b) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂))(1/c - 1/d) ) ]\n\nAlternatively, simplifying the denominator:\n\nLet me write the denominator as:\n\n(1/(K₁))(1/a - 1/b) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂))(1/c - 1/d) \n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(1/a)(1/K₁) - (1/b)(1/K₁) + 1/b - 1/c + (1/c)(1/K₂) - (1/d)(1/K₂)\n\nBut maybe it's better to keep it as it is. \n\nAlternatively, if I want to express the capacitance in terms of series capacitors. Let me check if the two approaches agree. \n\nEarlier, I thought of three capacitors in series, with each C₁, C₂, C₃ as:\n\nC₁ = 4πε₀K₁ (ab)/(b - a)\n\nSimilarly, C₂ = 4πε₀ (bc)/(c - b)\n\nC₃ = 4πε₀K₂ (cd)/(d - c)\n\nThen 1/C_total = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃ \n\nLet me compute 1/C₁:\n\n1/C₁ = (b - a)/(4πε₀K₁ ab)\n\nSimilarly, 1/C₂ = (c - b)/(4πε₀ bc)\n\n1/C₃ = (d - c)/(4πε₀K₂ cd)\n\nTherefore, adding them up:\n\n1/C_total = [ (b - a)/(K₁ ab) + (c - b)/(bc) + (d - c)/(K₂ cd) ] / (4πε₀)\n\nTherefore, C_total = 4πε₀ / [ (b - a)/(K₁ ab) + (c - b)/(bc) + (d - c)/(K₂ cd) ) ]\n\nLet me compare this with the expression I obtained from the potential method. \n\nFrom the potential method, we had:\n\nC = 4πε₀ / [ (1/(K₁))(1/a - 1/b) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂))(1/c - 1/d) ) ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator in that expression:\n\n(1/(K₁))(1/a - 1/b) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂))(1/c - 1/d) \n\n= (1/(K₁ a) - 1/(K₁ b)) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d))\n\nLet me see if this is equal to the denominator from the series capacitor approach:\n\nDenominator from series approach:\n\n(b - a)/(K₁ ab) + (c - b)/(bc) + (d - c)/(K₂ cd)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (b - a)/(K₁ ab) = [b/(K₁ ab) - a/(K₁ ab)] = [1/(K₁ a) - 1/(K₁ b)]\n\nSecond term: (c - b)/(b c) = [c/(b c) - b/(b c)] = [1/b - 1/c]\n\nThird term: (d - c)/(K₂ c d) = [d/(K₂ c d) - c/(K₂ c d)] = [1/(K₂ d) - 1/(K₂ c)] = - [1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d)]\n\nWait, but in the potential method, the third term is (1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d)), whereas here, the third term is [ - (1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d)) ]? Wait, no:\n\nWait, let me check again. The third term in the series approach denominator is (d - c)/(K₂ c d). Let me write:\n\n(d - c)/(K₂ c d) = d/(K₂ c d) - c/(K₂ c d) = 1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d). \n\nWhich is exactly the same as the third term in the potential method. Therefore, the denominators are the same. Therefore, both approaches agree. \n\nTherefore, the capacitance is indeed given by 4πε₀ divided by that denominator. \n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nC = 4πε₀ / [ (1/(K₁ a) - 1/(K₁ b)) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d)) ) ]\n\nAlternatively, simplifying the denominator:\n\nLet me combine terms:\n\n= [1/(K₁ a) - 1/(K₁ b) + 1/b - 1/c + 1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d)]\n\nBut perhaps we can factor terms:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n= 1/(K₁ a) + [ -1/(K₁ b) + 1/b ] + [ -1/c + 1/(K₂ c) ] - 1/(K₂ d)\n\nBut maybe it's not necessary to simplify further unless there is a specific reason. \n\nTherefore, the capacitance is:\n\nC = 4πε₀ / [ (1/a)/K₁ - (1/b)/K₁ + 1/b - 1/c + (1/c)/K₂ - (1/d)/K₂ ) ]\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write this as a single expression, perhaps combining terms with common denominators. \n\nBut maybe the answer is expected to be written in terms of those fractions. Let me check if there is a more elegant way. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about the general formula for spherical capacitors with multiple dielectrics. Since each region contributes a term based on their respective radii and permittivities, the formula seems correct. \n\nBut let me check for a simpler case. Suppose there is only vacuum between a and d, so K₁ and K₂ are 1, and b = a, c = d? Wait, no. Suppose there is only vacuum, so K₁ and K₂ don't exist. Wait, in that case, the formula should reduce to the standard spherical capacitor. Let me see. \n\nSuppose K₁ and K₂ are not there, meaning that the entire region from a to d is vacuum. But in our problem, the regions are from a to b, then b to c, then c to d. If we set b = a, c = b, and d = c? No, that might not be straightforward. Let me instead consider that there is only one region, say from a to d with vacuum. So set K₁ = 1, and b approaches d, but that seems messy. \n\nAlternatively, suppose that b approaches a from above, and c approaches d from below. Wait, maybe not. Let me take a case where there is only vacuum between a and d. So, in our formula, set K₁ = 1, K₂ = 1, and have the regions a to b, b to c, c to d all be vacuum. But if the entire region is vacuum, then the capacitance should be 4πε₀ (a d)/(d - a)? No, wait. Wait, for spherical capacitors, the formula is 4πε₀ (a b)/(b - a). So if there are two spheres, inner radius a, outer radius d, with vacuum in between, the capacitance is 4πε₀ (a d)/(d - a)? Wait no, if the outer radius is d, then it's 4πε₀ (a d)/(d - a)? Wait, no. Wait, for concentric spheres, inner radius r1, outer radius r2, capacitance is 4πε₀ r1 r2 / (r2 - r1). So if r1 = a and r2 = d, then yes, C = 4πε₀ (a d)/(d - a). \n\nBut in our formula, if we have K₁ = 1, K₂ = 1, and set b = a, c = d? No, because the regions are a < r < b, then b < r < c, then c < r < d. If we want to have only one region, we need to have b = a and c = d? No, that would collapse the regions. Alternatively, set b = c, so that the middle region is zero? Maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, imagine that the three regions are merged into one. Let me set b approaching a and c approaching d? Not sure. Alternatively, let me take specific values. Let me suppose that a = 1, d = 2, and the entire region from 1 to 2 is vacuum. Then, according to standard formula, C = 4πε₀*(1*2)/(2 - 1) = 8πε₀. \n\nNow, in our formula, if we have K₁ = 1, K₂ = 1, and choose b and c as arbitrary points between 1 and 2. Let me choose b = 1.5 and c = 1.5? Wait, but then the middle region (b to c) would be zero. Alternatively, choose b = 1. Let me think. Suppose that b approaches a from above, so b = a + ε, and c approaches d from below, c = d - ε. Then, let me compute the denominator:\n\nDenominator D = (1/(K₁ a) - 1/(K₁ b)) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d))\n\nWith K₁ = K₂ = 1, and b approaching a, c approaching d. \n\nSo, D ≈ [ (1/a - 1/b ) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/c - 1/d) ] \n\nWhich telescopes to 1/a - 1/d. Therefore, D = 1/a - 1/d. Then, C = 4πε₀ / (1/a - 1/d) = 4πε₀ a d / (d - a), which matches the standard formula. Therefore, our formula works in that case. \n\nTherefore, the general formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer for the capacitance is:\n\nC = 4πε₀ divided by [ (1/(K₁ a) - 1/(K₁ b)) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d)) ]\n\nAlternatively, factor out terms:\n\n= 4πε₀ / [ (1/a - 1/b)/K₁ + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/c - 1/d)/K₂ ]\n\nWhich is another way to write the same thing. \n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nC = 4πε₀ / [ (1/(K₁ a) + (1 - 1/K₁)/b + (1/K₂ - 1)/c - 1/(K₂ d) ) ]\n\nBut that might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the denominator as:\n\n(1/a)/K₁ + [ ( -1/(K₁ b) + 1/b ) ] + [ -1/c + 1/(K₂ c) ] - 1/(K₂ d)\n\nBut again, unless there is a specific need to combine terms, perhaps the answer is best left as:\n\nC = \\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0}{\\left( \\frac{1}{K_1 a} - \\frac{1}{K_1 b} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{c} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{K_2 c} - \\frac{1}{K_2 d} \\right)} \n\nBut let me check if there's a way to write this more elegantly. \n\nAlternatively, notice that each term in the denominator corresponds to the contribution of each dielectric layer. For the first layer (a to b), the term is (1/a - 1/b)/K₁, for the vacuum layer (b to c), it's (1/b - 1/c)/1, and for the third layer (c to d), it's (1/c - 1/d)/K₂. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the denominator is:\n\n(1/(K₁ a) - 1/(K₁ b)) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/(K₂ c) - 1/(K₂ d))\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(1/K₁)(1/a - 1/b) + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/K₂)(1/c - 1/d)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n(1/a - 1/b)/K₁ + (1/b - 1/c)/1 + (1/c - 1/d)/K₂\n\nTherefore, if I think of each term as (1/inner - 1/outer)/K for each layer, where K is the relative permittivity of that layer. For the vacuum layer, K = 1. \n\nTherefore, the formula is:\n\nC = 4πε₀ / [ Σ (1/inner - 1/outer)/K for each layer ]\n\nWhich is a nice way to think about it. \n\nTherefore, since there are three layers:\n\nLayer 1: inner radius a, outer radius b, K = K₁: contributes (1/a - 1/b)/K₁\n\nLayer 2: inner radius b, outer radius c, K = 1: contributes (1/b - 1/c)/1\n\nLayer 3: inner radius c, outer radius d, K = K₂: contributes (1/c - 1/d)/K₂\n\nTherefore, adding them up gives the denominator. \n\nTherefore, the answer is as derived. \n\nTherefore, the capacitance is 4πε₀ divided by that sum. \n\nSo, unless there is a simplification required, this is the expression. \n\nBut let me check if the problem mentions any specific values or if it expects a certain form. The problem says \"calculate the capacitance of the capacitor,\" so likely this expression is acceptable. However, maybe we can write it as:\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\nLet me denote D = (1/a - 1/b)/K₁ + (1/b - 1/c) + (1/c - 1/d)/K₂ \n\nTherefore, C = 4πε₀ / D \n\nAlternatively, combining terms:\n\nD = (1/a)/K₁ - (1/b)/K₁ + 1/b - 1/c + (1/c)/K₂ - (1/d)/K₂ \n\n= (1/a)/K₁ + [ - (1/b)/K₁ + 1/b ] + [ -1/c + (1/c)/K₂ ] - (1/d)/K₂ \n\n= (1/a)/K₁ + (1/b)(1 - 1/K₁) + (1/c)(1/K₂ - 1) - (1/d)/K₂ \n\nBut again, unless there is a specific reason to do so, perhaps it's better to leave it in the original form. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the entire denominator as:\n\n[ (1/(K₁ a) + (1 - 1/K₁)/b ) + ... ] but again, not particularly useful. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nC = \\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0}{\\frac{1}{K_1 a} - \\frac{1}{K_1 b} + \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{K_2 c} - \\frac{1}{K_2 d}} \n\nAlternatively, factor 1/K₁ and 1/K₂:\n\nC = \\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0}{\\frac{1}{K_1}\\left( \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{b} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{c} \\right) + \\frac{1}{K_2}\\left( \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{d} \\right)} \n\nWhich is a more structured way to present it. \n\nTherefore, this should be the capacitance. \n\nLet me check once again if the units make sense. The denominator has terms like 1/m, so overall denominator is 1/m, multiplied by 4πε₀ which has units of Farads*m. Therefore, Farads*m / (1/m) = Farads, which is correct. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct expression. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe capacitance of the capacitor is \\boxed{\\dfrac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0}{\\dfrac{1}{K_1}\\left( \\dfrac{1}{a} - \\dfrac{1}{b} \\right) + \\left( \\dfrac{1}{b} - \\dfrac{1}{c} \\right) + \\dfrac{1}{K_2}\\left( \\dfrac{1}{c} - \\dfrac{1}{d} \\right)}}.\n</think>"}
