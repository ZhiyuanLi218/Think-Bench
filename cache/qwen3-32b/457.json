The answer choices are from nanometers up to meters, so I need to calculate it accurately. Let me start by recalling the physics involved here.\n\nFirst, when a charged particle moves in a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. This force is called the Lorentz force. The formula for the Lorentz force is F = q(v × B), where q is the charge, v is the velocity, and B is the magnetic field. Since the velocity and magnetic field are perpendicular in this case (assuming the beam is moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field), the force will be maximum and provide the centripetal force needed for circular motion.\n\nSo, the Lorentz force here acts as the centripetal force. The equation for centripetal force is F = (m*v²)/r, where m is the mass of the particle, v is its speed, and r is the radius of the circular path. Therefore, setting the two forces equal to each other:\n\nq*v*B = (m*v²)/r\n\nI can cancel out the velocity v from both sides (assuming v ≠ 0, which it isn't here):\n\nq*B = (m*v)/r\n\nThen solving for r:\n\nr = (m*v)/(q*B)\n\nAlright, so I need to plug in the values for the mass of an electron, the velocity, the charge of an electron, and the magnetic field strength.\n\nLet me recall the constants:\n\n- Mass of an electron, m = 9.11 × 10^-31 kg\n- Charge of an electron, q = -1.6 × 10^-19 C (but since we're dealing with magnitudes here, I can just use the absolute value)\n- Velocity, v = 1 × 10^7 m/s\n- Magnetic field, B = 5 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo plugging these into the formula:\n\nr = (9.11 × 10^-31 kg * 1 × 10^7 m/s) / (1.6 × 10^-19 C * 5 × 10^-5 T)\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: 9.11 × 10^-31 * 1 × 10^7 = 9.11 × 10^(-31 + 7) = 9.11 × 10^-24 kg·m/s\n\nDenominator: 1.6 × 10^-19 * 5 × 10^-5 = (1.6 * 5) × 10^(-19 -5) = 8 × 10^-24 C·T\n\nSo now r = (9.11 × 10^-24) / (8 × 10^-24) = 9.11 / 8 ≈ 1.13875 meters\n\nWait, that can't be right. The answer choices include 1 meter as option D. But my calculation gives approximately 1.14 meters. However, the options are 1 nm, 1 μm, 1 mm, 1 m. The closest is D: 1 m. But let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recompute the denominator:\n\n1.6 × 10^-19 C multiplied by 5 × 10^-5 T. 1.6*5 is 8, and 10^-19 * 10^-5 is 10^-24. So denominator is 8 × 10^-24. Correct.\n\nNumerator: 9.11 × 10^-31 * 1 × 10^7. 10^-31 *10^7 is 10^-24. So 9.11 × 10^-24. Correct.\n\nSo 9.11 / 8 is approximately 1.13875. So about 1.14 meters. But the answer options are 1 m. Hmm. Is there a possibility that I made a mistake in the exponents?\n\nWait, let me check the exponents again:\n\nMass of electron is 9.11 × 10^-31 kg. Correct.\n\nVelocity is 1 × 10^7 m/s. Correct.\n\nCharge is 1.6 × 10^-19 C. Correct.\n\nMagnetic field is 5 × 10^-5 T. Correct.\n\nSo the exponents are okay. Let me check if I used the right formula. The formula r = (mv)/(qB) is correct for the radius of the circular path of a charged particle in a magnetic field. Yes, that's right.\n\nWait, so if the calculation gives approximately 1.14 meters, but the options are 1 m. Maybe the question expects an approximate value? Let me check with more precise numbers.\n\nWait, the exact value of the mass of the electron is 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg. Let's use more precise numbers.\n\nLet me recalculate with exact numbers:\n\nm = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg\n\nv = 1 × 10^7 m/s\n\nq = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C\n\nB = 5 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo numerator:\n\nm*v = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 * 1 × 10^7 = 9.10938356 × 10^-24 kg·m/s\n\nDenominator:\n\nq*B = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 * 5 × 10^-5 = 8.01088317 × 10^-24 C·T\n\nTherefore, r = 9.10938356 × 10^-24 / 8.01088317 × 10^-24 ≈ 9.10938356 / 8.01088317 ≈ 1.137 meters\n\nStill approximately 1.14 meters. So, if the options are A:1 nm, B:1 μm, C:1 mm, D:1 m. The closest is D:1 m. However, 1.14 is about 1.14 meters, which is larger than 1 meter. But maybe the question expects an approximate answer? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, let me check if I inverted the formula. Is it r = mv/(qB) or r = qB/(mv)? No, the derivation was correct. The Lorentz force provides the centripetal force. So qvB = mv² / r => r = mv/(qB). Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for the Earth's magnetic field? Wait, the question says the Earth's magnetic field is 5 × 10^-5 T. That is 50 microtesla, which is in the ballpark of the Earth's magnetic field, which is typically around 25 to 65 microtesla. So 5 × 10^-5 T is 50 μT, which is reasonable. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in different units? Let me check the calculation again:\n\nLet me compute 9.11 × 10^-31 kg * 1 × 10^7 m/s = 9.11 × 10^-24 kg·m/s. Correct.\n\nThen divide by (1.6 × 10^-19 C * 5 × 10^-5 T) = 8 × 10^-24 C·T. Correct.\n\nSo 9.11 / 8 ≈ 1.13875. So radius is approximately 1.14 meters. Therefore, the answer is closest to 1 meter, which is option D.\n\nBut the problem is that 1.14 meters is about 1.14 m. However, the options are 1 nm, 1 μm, 1 mm, 1 m. So the answer is D. However, maybe the question expects a different approach?\n\nWait, let me check if the velocity is relativistic. The speed is 10^7 m/s. The speed of light is 3 × 10^8 m/s, so 10^7 is about 3% the speed of light. At that speed, relativistic effects might be noticeable, but the problem doesn't mention relativistic corrections. So assuming non-relativistic, which is probably acceptable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in exponents? Let me check:\n\nLet me write out all exponents again:\n\nm = 9.11 × 10^-31 kg\n\nv = 1 × 10^7 m/s\n\nq = 1.6 × 10^-19 C\n\nB = 5 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo numerator: 9.11 × 10^-31 * 1 × 10^7 = 9.11 × 10^(-31 + 7) = 9.11 × 10^-24. Correct.\n\nDenominator: 1.6 × 10^-19 * 5 × 10^-5 = 8 × 10^(-19 -5) = 8 × 10^-24. Correct.\n\nTherefore, r = 9.11 / 8 × 10^(-24 + 24) = 9.11 / 8 × 10^0 ≈ 1.14 m. Correct.\n\nSo unless there's a factor I'm missing, like maybe the charge is negative? But since we're dealing with magnitudes, the sign doesn't matter here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the Earth's magnetic field in a different direction? But the problem states that it's desired to use the magnetic field of the Earth to bend the electron beam into a circle. So assuming that the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, which is the case for maximum effect. If the angle wasn't 90 degrees, we would have to include sin(theta), but since it's not mentioned, we assume theta = 90 degrees, sin(theta) = 1.\n\nSo I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 1.14 meters, which is closest to option D:1 m. However, since the exact value is 1.14, which is more than 1, but maybe in the options, they approximate it as 1 m. Alternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me check with approximate numbers. Let's approximate 9.11 / 8 as roughly 1.14. If I use 9 / 8 = 1.125, so yes, approximately 1.125 meters. So 1.125 m is about 1.13 m. So, the answer is about 1.1 m. So, if the options are 1 m, then D is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for the charge or mass of the electron? Let me check standard values. For example, sometimes in problems, they use 9.1 × 10^-31 kg for the electron mass and 1.6 × 10^-19 C for the charge. Let me check with those numbers.\n\nIf m = 9.1 × 10^-31 kg, q = 1.6 × 10^-19 C.\n\nThen r = (9.1 × 10^-31 * 1 × 10^7) / (1.6 × 10^-19 * 5 × 10^-5) = (9.1 × 10^-24) / (8 × 10^-24) = 9.1 / 8 ≈ 1.1375 m. Same result.\n\nSo no, the numbers are consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is D:1 m. The question probably expects rounding to 1 meter. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut let me check once more with exact computation using calculator-like steps.\n\nLet me compute 9.11 divided by 8:\n\n8 × 1.1 = 8.8\n\n9.11 - 8.8 = 0.31\n\nSo 0.31 / 8 = 0.03875\n\nSo total is 1.1 + 0.03875 = 1.13875. So 1.13875 meters. Yes, so approximately 1.14 meters. So, 1.14 meters is about 1.14 m. The options are 1 nm, 1 μm, 1 mm, 1 m. The answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem? For example, if the speed was 10^3 m/s instead of 10^7, but the problem says 10^7 m/s. Let me check with 10^3 m/s just in case.\n\nIf v = 10^3 m/s:\n\nNumerator: 9.11 × 10^-31 * 1 × 10^3 = 9.11 × 10^-28\n\nDenominator: same as before, 8 × 10^-24\n\nThen r = 9.11 × 10^-28 / 8 × 10^-24 = (9.11 / 8) × 10^(-28 + 24) = 1.13875 × 10^-4 meters = 0.113875 mm ≈ 0.114 mm, which is 114 micrometers. But that would be option B: 1 micrometer? No, 114 micrometers is 0.114 mm, which is closer to 0.1 mm, but the options are 1 micrometer (which is 0.001 mm) or 1 mm. So that's not matching either. But since the problem states 10^7 m/s, not 10^3, so that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Earth's magnetic field is different? If it was 5 × 10^-3 T instead of 5 × 10^-5 T, then denominator would be 8 × 10^-22, and r would be 9.11 × 10^-24 / 8 × 10^-22 ≈ 0.0114 meters, which is 1.14 cm, which is 11.4 mm. Still not matching the options. But the given B is 5e-5 T.\n\nAlternatively, if the velocity was 10^5 m/s instead of 10^7, let's see:\n\nNumerator: 9.11e-31 * 1e5 = 9.11e-26\n\nDenominator: same 8e-24\n\nr = 9.11e-26 / 8e-24 ≈ 0.0114 m = 1.14 cm, which is 11.4 mm. Still not matching the options. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check again.\n\nCentripetal force is mv² / r. Lorentz force is qvB. Setting equal:\n\nmv² / r = qvB => r = mv/(qB). Yes, correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 1.14 meters, which is closest to option D:1 m. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
