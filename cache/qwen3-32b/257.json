The force is given as F = 4y i + 2x j + k, and the helix is described by x = 4 cos θ, y = 4 sin θ, z = 2θ. Wait, the question specifically says \"the work done by the force k\", but k is a component of the force F. Maybe there's a typo here? Or maybe it's referring to the k component of the force? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Find the work done by the force k on the particle during this process.\" Hmm, maybe they meant the work done by the force F, which has a k component? Because the force F is given as 4y i + 2x j + k. So maybe it's a typo and they meant the work done by the force F? Or maybe they want just the work done by the k component of the force? Let me think.\n\nWork done by a force is generally the line integral of the force over the path. So if they want the work done by the entire force F, then I need to compute the line integral of F · dr from θ = 0 to θ = 2π. If they specifically want the work done by the k component, then it would be the integral of the k component of F dotted with the dr vector. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Find the work done by the force k on the particle during this process.\" But in the given force, the k component is just 1, right? Because F is 4y i + 2x j + k. So the k component is the vector k, which is (0, 0, 1). So maybe they are asking for the work done by the vector field k? But k is a constant vector field? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe there was a misprint and they meant the force F? Or maybe they meant the work done by the force in the k direction? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written correctly, and they want the work done by the force field F_k, which is the k component of F? But in that case, the force would be just k, so F = k. However, the original force is given as 4y i + 2x j + k, so maybe the problem is asking for the work done by the k component of F, which is the constant vector field (0, 0, 1). Let me check the problem again:\n\n\"A particle moves under the force F = 4y i + 2x j + k along a helix described by x = 4 cos θ, y = 4 sin θ, z = 2θ from θ = 0 to θ = 2π. Find the work done by the force k on the particle during this process.\"\n\nWait, maybe they mean the force in the k direction? But the force is given as F, which includes a k component. Maybe they are referring to the k component of the force? So the work done by the k component of F? If that's the case, then we can compute the line integral of (F · k) dz or something? Wait, no. The work done by a force is the integral of F · dr. If we want the work done by just the k component of the force, then it would be the integral of (k component of F) times dz, since the k direction is along z. Since the k component of F is 1, then the work done by that component would be ∫1 dz from θ=0 to θ=2π.\n\nBut let me verify. Let me recall that work done by a force field F is ∫ F · dr. If we decompose F into its components, say F = F_i i + F_j j + F_k k, then the work done is ∫ F_i dx + F_j dy + F_k dz. Therefore, if the question is asking for the work done by the k component of F, which is F_k = 1, then it would be ∫ F_k dz = ∫ 1 dz from θ=0 to θ=2π. Since z = 2θ, dz = 2 dθ. Therefore, ∫ 1 * 2 dθ from 0 to 2π would be 2*(2π - 0) = 4π. Is that the answer? But let me check again if the question is indeed asking for that.\n\nBut the problem says \"the work done by the force k\". If k is a force, then maybe they are referring to the force vector k, which is (0, 0, 1). So if the force is (0, 0, 1), then the work done would be ∫ (0 dx + 0 dy + 1 dz) = ∫ dz. Which would be the same as above, ∫ dz from θ=0 to θ=2π is z(2π) - z(0) = 2*(2π) - 2*0 = 4π. Wait, but z = 2θ, so when θ goes from 0 to 2π, z goes from 0 to 4π. Therefore, ∫ dz from 0 to 4π is 4π - 0 = 4π. So that would be the work done by the force (0, 0, 1). But in the problem statement, the total force is given as F = 4y i + 2x j + k, so maybe there was a misprint and they meant the work done by F? But the problem says \"the work done by the force k\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe they meant the work done by the entire force F, but wrote \"force k\" instead. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nIf they meant the work done by the entire force F, then I need to compute ∫ F · dr from θ=0 to θ=2π. Let me try that as well, just to see if it's different. Maybe the answer is different, and perhaps the problem had a typo. Let me compute both.\n\nFirst, let's suppose the problem is correct as stated, and we need to compute the work done by the force k, which is (0, 0, 1). Then as above, the work is ∫ dz from z=0 to z=4π, which is 4π. But let me do it parametrically to be sure.\n\nGiven the path is parametrized by θ from 0 to 2π, with x = 4 cos θ, y = 4 sin θ, z = 2θ. So dr/dθ is derivative of position vector r(θ) = (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ, 2θ). Therefore, dr/dθ = (-4 sin θ, 4 cos θ, 2). Therefore, dr = dr/dθ dθ.\n\nIf the force is k, which is (0, 0, 1), then F · dr is (0, 0, 1) · (-4 sin θ, 4 cos θ, 2) dθ = 0 + 0 + 2*1 dθ = 2 dθ. Therefore, integrating from θ=0 to θ=2π gives ∫0^{2π} 2 dθ = 2*(2π) = 4π. So that's consistent. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the work done by the force k (i.e., the constant vector field (0, 0, 1)), then the answer is 4π.\n\nBut let me check again if the problem might have meant the total work done by force F. Let's compute that as well, just to see if it's different. If so, maybe I can check with another method.\n\nCompute work done by F = 4y i + 2x j + k. So ∫ F · dr from θ=0 to θ=2π.\n\nFirst, express F in terms of θ. Since x = 4 cos θ, y = 4 sin θ, z = 2θ. So:\n\nF = 4y i + 2x j + k = 4*(4 sin θ) i + 2*(4 cos θ) j + k = 16 sin θ i + 8 cos θ j + k.\n\nThen, dr/dθ is (-4 sin θ, 4 cos θ, 2). Therefore, F · dr/dθ is:\n\n(16 sin θ)(-4 sin θ) + (8 cos θ)(4 cos θ) + (1)(2) =\n\n-64 sin²θ + 32 cos²θ + 2.\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{2π} [ -64 sin²θ + 32 cos²θ + 2 ] dθ.\n\nThis seems more complicated, but let's compute it.\n\nFirst, note that ∫ sin²θ dθ over 0 to 2π is π, similarly ∫ cos²θ dθ over 0 to 2π is π.\n\nTherefore:\n\n-64 * π + 32 * π + 2 * 2π = (-64π + 32π + 4π) = (-64 + 32 + 4)π = (-28π). Wait, that can't be right? Wait:\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nThe integral is:\n\n-64 ∫ sin²θ dθ + 32 ∫ cos²θ dθ + 2 ∫ dθ, from 0 to 2π.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -64 * π\n\nSecond term: 32 * π\n\nThird term: 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π\n\nTherefore, total integral: (-64π + 32π + 4π) = (-64 + 32 + 4)π = (-28π). So the total work done by force F is -28π. But that seems odd. However, if the problem had asked for the work done by F, the answer would be -28π. But since the problem specifically says \"the work done by the force k\", which we computed as 4π, then that's the answer. However, maybe the problem is in another interpretation.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is not referring to the k component of the force, but the force in the direction of k? But that's the same thing. Alternatively, maybe they meant the force is k, not the component? But that seems like the same thing here. Since the force F has a k component of 1. So if you consider the force field F_k = k, then the work done by that force is 4π.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. For example, if the force was conservative, we could find a potential function, but since we are only asked about the k component, which is conservative? The k component is a constant vector field. The work done by a constant force is F · Δr. Wait, but here the path is a helix. However, if the force is constant, then the work done is F · (r_final - r_initial). Let's check.\n\nThe constant force is (0, 0, 1). The initial position at θ=0 is (4, 0, 0). The final position at θ=2π is (4 cos 2π, 4 sin 2π, 4π) = (4, 0, 4π). Therefore, Δr = (4 - 4, 0 - 0, 4π - 0) = (0, 0, 4π). Then, F · Δr = (0, 0, 1) · (0, 0, 4π) = 4π. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, this confirms that the work done by the constant force k is indeed 4π. Therefore, regardless of the path, since the force is conservative (constant force is conservative), the work done is just F · Δr. Therefore, the answer is 4π.\n\nBut why is the problem giving all that information about the force F and the helical path? Maybe there was confusion in the problem statement. If they had asked for the work done by the entire force F, then the path matters and we need to compute the line integral, which we did as -28π. But since they specifically mention \"the work done by the force k\", which is part of the given force F, then we can safely assume they want the 4π.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and \"force k\" is supposed to be \"force F\". But given the problem as stated, I think 4π is the answer they expect.\n\nBut let me just check once more. If someone says \"the work done by the force k\", and k is a unit vector, then technically, the force would be a vector field, so they might mean the force field that is always in the k direction with magnitude 1. Which is exactly what we considered. Therefore, the answer is 4π.\n\nAlternatively, if they had meant the work done by the particle against the force k, but no, the question says \"the work done by the force k on the particle\", so it's the work done by that force on the particle, which is what we computed.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 4π. However, to make sure, let me check if there is a possibility that \"the force k\" refers to something else. For example, in some contexts, forces are labeled as F_x, F_y, F_z, but here the force is given as F = ... + k. Maybe in the problem statement, the force is supposed to be F = 4y i + 2x j + z k or something else? Wait, no, the problem says \"the force k\". If it was a misprint and they meant \"the force F\", then answer is -28π, but since they said \"force k\", I think 4π is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they meant the work done by the component of F in the k direction? Which would be same as integrating F_k dz, which is same as what we did. Because the work done by the k component is ∫ F_k dz. Since F_k is 1, and dz is 2 dθ, integrated over θ from 0 to 2π gives 4π. So yes, same result.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 4π. Therefore, the work done by the force k on the particle is 4π.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe work done by the force $\\boldsymbol{k}$ on the particle is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.\n</think>"}
