This assumption is reasonable because the expression is symmetric in $ x $ and $ z $, and often in such symmetric optimization problems, the minimum occurs when variables are equal.\n\nLet $ x = z = a $, and $ y = b $. Then:\n- $ S = x + y + z = 2a + b $\n- $ xyz S = a \\cdot b \\cdot a \\cdot (2a + b) = a^2 b (2a + b) = 1 $\n- The expression becomes:\n  $$\n  (x + y)(y + z) = (a + b)^2\n  $$\n\nWe now seek to **minimize** $ (a + b)^2 $ under the constraint:\n$$\na^2 b (2a + b) = 1\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Change of Variables\n\nLet’s define $ t = \\frac{a}{b} $, so that $ a = tb $. Substituting into the constraint:\n$$\na^2 b (2a + b) = (t^2 b^2) \\cdot b \\cdot (2tb + b) = t^2 b^3 (2t + 1) = 1\n$$\n\nSolving for $ b $:\n$$\nb^3 = \\frac{1}{t^2 (2t + 1)} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\left( \\frac{1}{t^2 (2t + 1)} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nNow, the expression to minimize is:\n$$\n(a + b)^2 = (tb + b)^2 = b^2 (t + 1)^2\n$$\n\nSubstitute $ b^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{t^2 (2t + 1)} \\right)^{2/3} $, so:\n$$\n(a + b)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{t^2 (2t + 1)} \\right)^{2/3} \\cdot (t + 1)^2\n$$\n\nLet’s define:\n$$\nf(t) = \\frac{(t + 1)^2}{t^2 (2t + 1)^{2/3}}\n$$\n\nWe now minimize $ f(t) $ for $ t > 0 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Minimum\n\nTo find the minimum of $ f(t) $, we can take the derivative and find the critical point.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that optimization problems with constraints can often be tackled using methods like Lagrange multipliers, but since this is likely an algebra problem, maybe there's a way to apply inequalities like AM-GM here. Let me recall that the AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, with equality when all numbers are equal.\n\nBut before jumping into that, let me try to understand the expression I need to minimize: (x + y)(y + z). Let me expand this expression to see if it simplifies or gives me a clue. Expanding, we get:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = x y + x z + y^2 + y z.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe there's a way to relate this to the given constraint xyz(x + y + z) = 1.\n\nLet me write down the constraint again: xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Let me denote S = x + y + z. Then the constraint becomes xyz * S = 1. So, maybe I can express S in terms of xyz or vice versa.\n\nBut how does that relate to (x + y)(y + z)? Let me note that (x + y)(y + z) can be rewritten as (x + y + z)y + x z. Wait, let me check that:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = x y + x z + y^2 + y z = y(x + y + z) + x z. Yes! So, (x + y)(y + z) = y S + x z, where S = x + y + z.\n\nSo, we have to minimize y S + x z given that xyz S = 1. Hmm, interesting. Let me write that down:\n\nMinimize y S + x z subject to xyz S = 1.\n\nBut S is x + y + z, so maybe I need to find relations between these variables. Perhaps I can use substitution. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Let me try that approach. Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote the function to minimize as f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z), and the constraint is g(x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z) - 1 = 0.\n\nThen, according to the method of Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of f and g should satisfy ∇f = λ ∇g for some λ.\n\nSo, let me compute the partial derivatives of f and g.\n\nFirst, f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z) = x y + x z + y^2 + y z.\n\nSo,\n\ndf/dx = y + z,\n\ndf/dy = x + 2 y + z,\n\ndf/dz = x + y.\n\nNow, the constraint function g(x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z) - 1.\n\nLet me compute the partial derivatives of g.\n\nFirst, let me denote S = x + y + z, so g = xyz S - 1.\n\nCompute dg/dx:\n\nUsing product rule: derivative of xyz S with respect to x is y z S + xyz * derivative of S with respect to x. Since derivative of S with respect to x is 1, so dg/dx = y z S + xyz * 1 = y z (S + x).\n\nSimilarly,\n\ndg/dy = x z (S + y),\n\ndg/dz = x y (S + z).\n\nTherefore, according to Lagrange multipliers:\n\ndf/dx = λ dg/dx,\n\ndf/dy = λ dg/dy,\n\ndf/dz = λ dg/dz.\n\nSo, writing equations:\n\n1) y + z = λ y z (S + x),\n\n2) x + 2 y + z = λ x z (S + y),\n\n3) x + y = λ x y (S + z).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can find relations between variables.\n\nLet me denote equations 1, 2, 3 as above.\n\nLet me try to take ratios of these equations to eliminate λ.\n\nFor example, take equation 1 divided by equation 3:\n\n(y + z)/(x + y) = [λ y z (S + x)] / [λ x y (S + z)] = [z (S + x)] / [x (S + z)].\n\nSimplify left side: (y + z)/(x + y).\n\nRight side: [z (S + x)] / [x (S + z)].\n\nSo:\n\n(y + z)/(x + y) = [z (S + x)] / [x (S + z)].\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n(y + z) x (S + z) = (x + y) z (S + x).\n\nLet me divide both sides by z:\n\n(y + z) x (S + z)/z = (x + y) (S + x).\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful. Let me try plugging in S = x + y + z.\n\nLet me note that S + x = x + y + z + x = 2x + y + z,\n\nSimilarly S + z = x + y + z + z = x + y + 2 z.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nLeft side: (y + z) x (x + y + 2 z),\n\nRight side: (x + y) z (2x + y + z).\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there is symmetry or substitution that can be made here. Alternatively, maybe assuming some variables are equal?\n\nIn optimization problems with symmetry, sometimes the extremum occurs when variables are equal or in some proportion. Let me check if assuming x = z can help here. Maybe due to the symmetry in (x + y)(y + z), if we set x = z, perhaps we can simplify things.\n\nLet me try assuming x = z. Let me let x = z. Then, since variables are positive, this is allowed.\n\nSo, let me set x = z. Then, the constraint becomes x y x (x + y + x) = x^2 y (2x + y) = 1.\n\nAnd the expression to minimize is (x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)^2.\n\nWait, so if x = z, then (x + y)(y + z) becomes (x + y)^2, so we need to minimize (x + y)^2 given that x^2 y (2x + y) = 1. Hmm, maybe this is manageable.\n\nLet me denote t = x / y. Let me set t = x / y, so that x = t y. Then, substituting into the constraint:\n\nx^2 y (2x + y) = (t y)^2 * y * (2 t y + y) = t^2 y^3 * y (2 t + 1) = t^2 (2 t + 1) y^4 = 1.\n\nTherefore, y^4 = 1 / [t^2 (2 t + 1)].\n\nTherefore, y = [1 / (t^2 (2 t + 1))]^{1/4}.\n\nThen, the expression to minimize is (x + y)^2 = (t y + y)^2 = y^2 (t + 1)^2.\n\nSubstituting y^2 from above: since y^4 = 1 / [t^2 (2 t + 1)], then y^2 = 1 / [t sqrt(2 t + 1)]? Wait:\n\nWait, if y^4 = 1 / [t^2 (2 t + 1)], then y^2 = 1 / [t sqrt(2 t + 1)]? Wait, let's take square roots:\n\ny^4 = [1 / (t^2 (2 t + 1))], so y^2 = 1 / [t sqrt(2 t + 1)]? Wait:\n\nActually, sqrt(y^4) = y^2 = sqrt(1 / [t^2 (2 t + 1)]) = 1 / [t sqrt(2 t + 1)].\n\nYes, correct. Therefore, the expression to minimize is:\n\ny^2 (t + 1)^2 = [1 / (t sqrt(2 t + 1))] * (t + 1)^2.\n\nTherefore, we need to minimize the function f(t) = (t + 1)^2 / [t sqrt(2 t + 1)] for t > 0.\n\nHmm, okay, this seems doable. Let me denote f(t) = (t + 1)^2 / [t sqrt(2 t + 1)]. Let me try to find its minimum.\n\nTo find the minimum, take derivative and set to zero. Let me compute f'(t).\n\nFirst, let me write f(t) as (t + 1)^2 * [t^{-1} (2 t + 1)^{-1/2}]. Maybe take natural logarithm to make differentiation easier.\n\nLet me set ln f(t) = 2 ln(t + 1) - ln t - (1/2) ln(2 t + 1).\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to t:\n\nf’(t)/f(t) = 2/(t + 1) - 1/t - (1/2)*(2)/(2 t + 1) = 2/(t + 1) - 1/t - 1/(2 t + 1).\n\nSet derivative to zero, so:\n\n2/(t + 1) - 1/t - 1/(2 t + 1) = 0.\n\nLet me solve this equation for t.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n2/(t + 1) - 1/t - 1/(2 t + 1) = 0.\n\nLet me find common denominators or combine terms step by step.\n\nFirst, let me combine 2/(t + 1) - 1/t:\n\nLet me write them as [2t - (t + 1)] / [t(t + 1)] = [2t - t - 1]/[t(t + 1)] = (t - 1)/[t(t + 1)].\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n(t - 1)/[t(t + 1)] - 1/(2 t + 1) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n(t - 1)/[t(t + 1)] = 1/(2 t + 1).\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n(t - 1)(2 t + 1) = t(t + 1).\n\nLet me expand left side:\n\n(t - 1)(2 t + 1) = t*(2 t + 1) - 1*(2 t + 1) = 2 t^2 + t - 2 t - 1 = 2 t^2 - t - 1.\n\nRight side: t(t + 1) = t^2 + t.\n\nSet equal:\n\n2 t^2 - t - 1 = t^2 + t.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2 t^2 - t - 1 - t^2 - t = t^2 - 2 t - 1 = 0.\n\nSo quadratic equation: t^2 - 2 t - 1 = 0.\n\nSolutions: t = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 4)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(8)] / 2 = [2 ± 2 sqrt(2)] / 2 = 1 ± sqrt(2).\n\nSince t > 0, and 1 - sqrt(2) is negative, so we take t = 1 + sqrt(2).\n\nSo t = 1 + sqrt(2). Let me note that.\n\nTherefore, the critical point occurs at t = 1 + sqrt(2). Now, need to check if this is a minimum.\n\nSince we have only one critical point and the function tends to infinity as t approaches 0+ and as t approaches infinity, this critical point must be the minimum. Let me verify with second derivative or test intervals, but maybe for brevity, let's assume it's a minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value occurs at t = 1 + sqrt(2). Now, let me compute f(t) at this t.\n\nFirst, let me compute f(t) = (t + 1)^2 / [t sqrt(2 t + 1)].\n\nGiven t = 1 + sqrt(2), let me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst compute t + 1 = 1 + sqrt(2) + 1 = 2 + sqrt(2).\n\nSo numerator is (2 + sqrt(2))^2.\n\nDenominator: t sqrt(2 t + 1).\n\nFirst compute 2 t + 1: 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) + 1 = 2 + 2 sqrt(2) + 1 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2).\n\nSo sqrt(2 t + 1) = sqrt(3 + 2 sqrt(2)).\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me note that 3 + 2 sqrt(2) is equal to (1 + sqrt(2))^2. Let me check:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 1 + 2 sqrt(2) + 2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Yes! Perfect. Therefore sqrt(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) = 1 + sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore denominator becomes t * (1 + sqrt(2)).\n\nBut t is 1 + sqrt(2), so denominator is (1 + sqrt(2)) * (1 + sqrt(2)) = (1 + sqrt(2))^2.\n\nTherefore, f(t) = [ (2 + sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (1 + sqrt(2))^2 ].\n\nLet me compute that. Let me note that 2 + sqrt(2) = (1 + 1) + sqrt(2). Alternatively, perhaps express 2 + sqrt(2) as a multiple of 1 + sqrt(2).\n\nLet me compute the ratio:\n\n(2 + sqrt(2)) / (1 + sqrt(2)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(2)):\n\n[ (2 + sqrt(2))(1 - sqrt(2)) ] / [ (1 + sqrt(2))(1 - sqrt(2)) ] = [ 2(1) - 2 sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)(1) - sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) ] / (1 - 2)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2 - 2 sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) - 2 = (2 - 2) + (-2 sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)) = 0 - sqrt(2) = - sqrt(2)\n\nDenominator: -1\n\nTherefore, the ratio is (-sqrt(2))/(-1) = sqrt(2). Therefore, (2 + sqrt(2))/(1 + sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2). Therefore, squaring both sides, [ (2 + sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (1 + sqrt(2))^2 ] = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nTherefore, f(t) = 2. So the minimal value when x = z and t = 1 + sqrt(2) is 2. Therefore, the minimal value of (x + y)^2 is 2, so (x + y)(y + z) is 2? Wait, but if x = z, then (x + y)(y + z) is (x + y)^2, which we found minimal value 2. Therefore, does that mean the minimal value is 2?\n\nBut wait, let me check if this is indeed the minimal value over all possible x, y, z, not just when x = z. Because I assumed x = z to simplify the problem. Is this assumption valid? Maybe the actual minimum occurs when x ≠ z. But given that we found a critical point under this assumption and got 2, perhaps that is the minimal value, but I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to show that the minimal value is 2 regardless of the assumption.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to approach the problem without assuming x = z.\n\nEarlier, I had rewritten (x + y)(y + z) = y S + x z, where S = x + y + z, and the constraint is xyz S = 1. So, need to minimize y S + x z.\n\nLet me think if I can relate these terms using AM-GM or other inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express variables in terms of others. For example, perhaps set variables such that a = x + y + z, b = x y + y z + z x, c = x y z. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider substituting variables. Let me think.\n\nLet me note that if we fix y, maybe we can express x and z in terms of something else. Alternatively, use substitution based on symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to use Hölder's inequality? Since we have products and sums.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of homogenization. Since we have a constraint, maybe we can homogenize the expression (x + y)(y + z).\n\nGiven that xyz(x + y + z) = 1, we can express variables in terms that satisfy this condition. Let me try to write the expression (x + y)(y + z) in terms that can be related to the constraint.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to use substitution. Let me set variables as follows: Let me set a = x + y + z, b = x + y, c = y + z. Then, note that (x + y)(y + z) = b c. Also, note that a = x + y + z, so z = a - b, x = a - c. Also, y = b + c - a. Wait, let me check:\n\nIf b = x + y and c = y + z, then adding them: b + c = x + 2 y + z. Since a = x + y + z, so b + c = a + y. Therefore, y = b + c - a. Similarly, z = a - b, x = a - c.\n\nBut since all variables x, y, z are positive, we must have that a > b, a > c, and b + c - a > 0 => b + c > a. Therefore, triangle-like inequalities. Interesting.\n\nBut how does this help? Let me see. The constraint is xyz(x + y + z) = 1, which is xyz a = 1. Let me express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c:\n\nx = a - c,\n\ny = b + c - a,\n\nz = a - b.\n\nTherefore, xyz a = [ (a - c)(b + c - a)(a - b) ] * a = 1.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider substituting variables such that u = x + y, v = y + z. Then, our target expression is u v. Also, note that x + y + z can be written as (x + y + z) = (u + z) = (u + (v - y)). Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since u = x + y and v = y + z, then adding them gives u + v = x + 2 y + z. Also, x + y + z = (u + v - y). But again, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express x and z in terms of u and v. Let me note that if u = x + y and v = y + z, then x = u - y and z = v - y. Then, x + y + z = (u - y) + y + (v - y) = u + v - y. Therefore, S = u + v - y.\n\nAlso, the constraint is xyz S = 1. Let me write that in terms of u, v, y:\n\nxyz S = (u - y) * y * (v - y) * (u + v - y) = 1.\n\nBut our target expression is u v. This seems even more complicated.\n\nPerhaps another approach. Let me consider that we need to minimize (x + y)(y + z). Let me denote A = x + y, B = y + z. Then, as above, A + B = x + 2 y + z. Also, x + y + z = (A + B - y). Let me denote S = x + y + z = A + B - y.\n\nBut maybe not helpful. Alternatively, since we have xyz S = 1, perhaps express variables in terms of A and B?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of y as a variable and express x and z in terms of A and B. For example, x = A - y, z = B - y. Then, S = A + B - y - y = A + B - 2 y? Wait, no:\n\nWait, S = x + y + z = (A - y) + y + (B - y) = A + B - y. Yes, as before. Therefore, S = A + B - y.\n\nTherefore, the constraint becomes:\n\nxyz S = (A - y) * y * (B - y) * (A + B - y) = 1.\n\nBut we need to minimize A B. This seems too abstract. Maybe not helpful.\n\nLet me return to my previous approach where I assumed x = z and found that the minimal value is 2. Let me check if that is indeed the case by testing with actual numbers.\n\nSuppose that x = z, and we found that t = 1 + sqrt(2). Let me compute the actual values.\n\nRecall that t = x / y = 1 + sqrt(2). Therefore, x = y (1 + sqrt(2)), and since x = z, z = y (1 + sqrt(2)).\n\nTherefore, variables are x = z = y (1 + sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me compute S = x + y + z = 2 x + y = 2 y (1 + sqrt(2)) + y = y [ 2(1 + sqrt(2)) + 1 ] = y [ 2 + 2 sqrt(2) + 1 ] = y [ 3 + 2 sqrt(2) ].\n\nThen, the constraint is xyz S = x^2 y S = [ y^2 (1 + sqrt(2))^2 ] * y * [ y (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) ] ?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nxyz S = x * y * z * S. Since x = z = (1 + sqrt(2)) y, so:\n\nxyz S = [ (1 + sqrt(2)) y ] * y * [ (1 + sqrt(2)) y ] * S = (1 + sqrt(2))^2 y^3 * S.\n\nBut S = y [ 3 + 2 sqrt(2) ].\n\nTherefore, xyz S = (1 + sqrt(2))^2 y^3 * y [ 3 + 2 sqrt(2) ] = (1 + sqrt(2))^2 (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) y^4.\n\nBut according to the constraint, this equals 1. Therefore, solving for y:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^2 (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) y^4 = 1.\n\nBut note that (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Therefore, the product becomes (3 + 2 sqrt(2))^2 y^4 = 1.\n\nTherefore, y^4 = 1 / (3 + 2 sqrt(2))^2.\n\nTherefore, y^2 = 1 / (3 + 2 sqrt(2)).\n\nTherefore, the expression (x + y)^2 is equal to [x + y]^2 = [ (1 + sqrt(2)) y + y ]^2 = [ y (2 + sqrt(2)) ]^2 = y^2 (2 + sqrt(2))^2.\n\nSubstituting y^2:\n\n[1 / (3 + 2 sqrt(2))] * (2 + sqrt(2))^2.\n\nBut note that 3 + 2 sqrt(2) is equal to (1 + sqrt(2))^2, and (2 + sqrt(2)) is (sqrt(2) + 2). Let me compute (2 + sqrt(2))^2:\n\n(2 + sqrt(2))^2 = 4 + 4 sqrt(2) + 2 = 6 + 4 sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes [6 + 4 sqrt(2)] / [3 + 2 sqrt(2)].\n\nNote that 6 + 4 sqrt(2) = 2*(3 + 2 sqrt(2)). Therefore, [2*(3 + 2 sqrt(2))]/[3 + 2 sqrt(2)] = 2. Therefore, indeed, the value is 2. So that checks out. Therefore, when x = z and t = 1 + sqrt(2), the value of (x + y)(y + z) is 2, and the constraint is satisfied. Therefore, 2 is a possible value. Now, need to check if it's indeed the minimum.\n\nBut how do I know there isn't a lower value when x ≠ z?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using AM-GM on the original problem.\n\nLet me think again about the expression (x + y)(y + z) = y S + x z.\n\nWe need to minimize y S + x z with xyz S = 1. Let me denote that.\n\nLet me consider variables x, y, z > 0.\n\nLet me try to use AM-GM on terms y S and x z. But since they are different terms, maybe not directly. Alternatively, express in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me assume that the minimal occurs when certain relations hold between variables. For example, in the case when x = z, we found a critical point. Maybe this is indeed the case when the minimum is achieved due to symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of fixing y and trying to minimize over x and z.\n\nGiven that, for fixed y, we need to minimize y S + x z with S = x + y + z and constraint xyz S = 1.\n\nBut since S = x + y + z, for fixed y, S = x + z + y. Let me denote T = x + z. Then S = T + y.\n\nSo, need to minimize y(T + y) + x z, given that xyz(T + y) = 1.\n\nBut x z is part of the expression. Let me note that for fixed T = x + z, the product x z is maximized when x = z. However, here we have x z in the expression we want to minimize. Wait, if we have y(T + y) + x z, and for fixed T, x z is maximized when x = z. But since we are minimizing, maybe we need to minimize x z? Wait, no, because the entire expression is y(T + y) + x z. So, if for fixed T, we can adjust x z. If we want to minimize the whole expression, perhaps we need to minimize x z? But since x z is added, yes. Therefore, for fixed T, to minimize y(T + y) + x z, we need to minimize x z, which occurs when one variable approaches 0 and the other approaches T. But if x approaches 0, then the constraint xyz(T + y) approaches 0, which contradicts the constraint of being 1. Similarly for z approaching 0. Therefore, there must be a balance.\n\nAlternatively, for fixed T and y, we can write the constraint as x z (T + y) = 1 / (y). Wait, original constraint is xyz S = 1 => xyz (T + y) = 1. Therefore, x z = 1 / [y (T + y)].\n\nTherefore, substituting into the expression to minimize:\n\ny(T + y) + x z = y(T + y) + 1 / [y (T + y)].\n\nLet me denote Q = y(T + y). Then the expression becomes Q + 1 / Q. Which is minimized when Q = 1, by AM-GM, since Q + 1/Q ≥ 2, with equality when Q = 1. Therefore, for fixed T and y, the minimal value of the expression is 2, achieved when Q = 1, i.e., y(T + y) = 1.\n\nTherefore, for each fixed T and y, the minimal value is 2, provided that we can satisfy the constraint. Wait, but Q = y(T + y) = 1, and from the constraint x z = 1 / [y(T + y)] = 1 / 1 = 1. Therefore, given that T = x + z, and x z = 1, we need to check if there exist positive x, z such that x + z = T and x z = 1. This is possible if and only if T ≥ 2 sqrt(x z) = 2 * 1 = 2, by AM-GM. Therefore, T ≥ 2.\n\nBut T is x + z, which is arbitrary except for the above. However, since we are minimizing over all variables, perhaps we can set T = 2, which gives minimal value of Q + 1/Q = 2. Therefore, if we can have T = 2 and y(T + y) = 1, then we can achieve the minimal value of 2.\n\nSo, let me check. If T = 2, then from y(T + y) = 1 => y(2 + y) = 1 => y^2 + 2 y - 1 = 0. Solving quadratic equation: y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 4)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(8)] / 2 = [-2 ± 2 sqrt(2)] / 2 = -1 ± sqrt(2). Since y > 0, we take y = -1 + sqrt(2). Wait, sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so -1 + 1.414 ≈ 0.414 > 0. Okay.\n\nTherefore, y = sqrt(2) - 1. Then, T = 2, and x z = 1. Also, since T = x + z = 2 and x z = 1, then x and z are roots of the equation t^2 - 2 t + 1 = 0, which factors as (t - 1)^2 = 0. Therefore, x = z = 1. Wait, but if x = z = 1, then T = 1 + 1 = 2, yes. So x = z = 1, y = sqrt(2) - 1.\n\nTherefore, let me check if this satisfies the original constraint xyz(x + y + z) = 1.\n\nCompute x + y + z = 1 + (sqrt(2) - 1) + 1 = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1 + 1 = 1 + sqrt(2).\n\nThen, xyz(x + y + z) = 1 * (sqrt(2) - 1) * 1 * (1 + sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2) - 1)(sqrt(2) + 1) = (2 - 1) = 1. Perfect! It satisfies the constraint.\n\nTherefore, with x = z = 1, y = sqrt(2) - 1, we have (x + y)(y + z) = (1 + y)^2. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + y = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1 = sqrt(2). Therefore, (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. Therefore, the minimal value is indeed 2. Therefore, regardless of the approach, we get that 2 is achievable and is the minimal value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2. Therefore, the minimum value of (x + y)(y + z) is \\boxed{2}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2}\n</think>"}
