Let $ G $ be the number of girls and $ B $ be the number of boys. We know:\n   $$\n   G + B = 35\n   $$\n2. The number of girls $ G $ is a multiple of 13. The possible values for $ G $ are 13 and 26 (since 13 * 3 = 39 exceeds 35).\n3. We also know there are more girls than boys, which translates to:\n   $$\n   G > B\n   $$\n   Substituting $ B = 35 - G $ into the inequality:\n   $$\n   G > 35 - G \\implies 2G > 35 \\implies G > 17.5\n   $$\n   Since $ G $ must be an integer, $ G $ must be at least 18.\n4.

Here, 26 is greater than 9.\n\nThus, the only valid solution is $ G = 26 $ and $ B = 9 $.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{9}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so there's this math club meeting with 35 students total. The problem says that the number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys. I need to figure out how many boys are there. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note that the total number of students is 35. Let me denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. So, G + B = 35. Got that equation.\n\nNow, the problem states that G is a multiple of 13. So, possible values for G would be 13, 26, 39, etc. But since the total number of students is 35, G can't be 39 or more. So, the possible values for G are 13 and 26. Let me check that. 13 times 1 is 13, 13 times 2 is 26, 13 times 3 is 39, which is too big. So, G can only be 13 or 26.\n\nNow, the problem also says there are more girls than boys. So, G > B. Since B = 35 - G, substituting that in, we get G > 35 - G. Let me solve that inequality. Adding G to both sides gives 2G > 35, so G > 17.5. Since the number of girls has to be an integer, G must be at least 18. \n\nSo, now we have two possible values for G: 13 and 26. But from the inequality, G must be greater than 17.5, so G has to be at least 18. Therefore, 13 is too small because 13 is less than 17.5. That leaves G = 26 as the only possible value. \n\nLet me verify that. If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. Then, checking if there are more girls than boys: 26 girls vs. 9 boys. Yes, 26 > 9. That satisfies the condition. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other multiples of 13 that I might have missed. Well, 13*1=13, 13*2=26, 13*3=39. As mentioned before, 39 is more than 35, so it's not possible. So, only 13 and 26. Since 13 doesn't satisfy the \"more girls than boys\" condition, only 26 works. Therefore, the number of boys is 35 - 26 = 9. \n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the possible numbers of boys? Let's see. If G is a multiple of 13, then B = 35 - G. So, B = 35 - 13k, where k is a positive integer. Since G must be positive, 13k < 35. Therefore, k can be 1 or 2, because 13*3=39>35. So, k=1 gives B=35-13=22, and k=2 gives B=35-26=9. \n\nNow, since there are more girls than boys, G > B. Let's check for each k:\n\nFor k=1: G=13, B=22. Is 13 > 22? No, that's false. So this doesn't work.\n\nFor k=2: G=26, B=9. Is 26 > 9? Yes, that's true. \n\nTherefore, the only possible value is k=2, leading to B=9. \n\nSo both approaches lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the number of boys is 9. \n\nWait, let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Total students: 26 girls + 9 boys = 35. Correct. 26 is a multiple of 13 (13*2). Correct. More girls than boys: 26 > 9. Correct. \n\nIs there any other angle to consider? For example, could there be zero boys? If all 35 were girls, then G=35. But 35 isn't a multiple of 13. 13*2=26, 13*3=39. So no. Similarly, could there be other numbers? For example, if there was a multiple of 13 that I didn't consider? Well, 13*0=0, but that would mean zero girls, which contradicts the statement that there are more girls than boys. So no. \n\nAnother check: Maybe the problem is a trick question where \"multiple of 13\" refers to something else? But no, the problem says \"the number of girls... is a multiple of 13,\" so straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe negative numbers? But you can't have negative students. So no. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The number of boys is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of boys at the meeting is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>"}
