The options are NH4Cl, BaCl2, H2SO4, and Ca(OH)2. Let me think about each one step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a salt dissolves in water, it can form an acidic, basic, or neutral solution depending on the ions it produces. This is related to the concept of hydrolysis. If the salt is derived from a strong acid and a weak base, the solution should be acidic. If it's from a weak acid and a strong base, the solution is basic. If both are strong or both are weak, then it's neutral.\n\nLet me go through each option:\n\nOption A: NH4Cl. Ammonium chloride. The ammonium ion (NH4+) is the conjugate acid of ammonia (NH3), which is a weak base. The chloride ion (Cl-) is the conjugate base of hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid. So when NH4Cl dissolves in water, the NH4+ ion will hydrolyze to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. The Cl- ion doesn't hydrolyze because it's from a strong acid. So NH4Cl should give an acidic solution. \n\nOption B: BaCl2. Barium chloride. Barium is a Group 2 metal, so its hydroxide would be a strong base. The chloride ion is from a strong acid as before. So BaCl2 is a salt of a strong base (Ba(OH)2) and a strong acid (HCl). Wait, but if both the cation and anion are from strong bases and acids, then the solution should be neutral. So BaCl2 in water should not produce acidic or basic solution. So this is probably not the answer.\n\nOption C: H2SO4. Sulfuric acid. Wait, but this isn't a salt. The question says \"the salt whose aqueous solution is acidic\". H2SO4 is a strong acid, not a salt. So maybe this is a trick option. If the question is about salts, then H2SO4 isn't a salt. Unless maybe they consider it as a salt? No, I think salts are ionic compounds formed from an acid and a base. H2SO4 is a strong acid. So maybe this is not the correct answer because it's not a salt. But wait, sometimes salts can be acidic. But H2SO4 itself is an acid. So perhaps the answer is A, not C. Unless the question has a mistake. But let me check the options again. The options are (A) NH4Cl, (B) BaCl2, (C) H2SO4, (D) Ca(OH)2. So C is an acid, D is a base (calcium hydroxide). So the answer is either A or B. But earlier I thought A is acidic. So maybe A is the answer.\n\nOption D: Ca(OH)2. Calcium hydroxide. This is a strong base. So its solution is basic, not acidic. So D is out.\n\nSo the options left are A and C. But the question specifies \"salt\", so C is an acid. So answer is A. NH4Cl.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me think again about each salt.\n\nNH4Cl: as mentioned, from NH3 (weak base) and HCl (strong acid). So the salt will hydrolyze to produce H+ ions. So acidic solution. Correct.\n\nBaCl2: from Ba(OH)2 (strong base) and HCl (strong acid). Both strong, so solution is neutral. So not acidic.\n\nH2SO4 is an acid, not a salt. So not the answer. Ca(OH)2 is a base.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other factors. For example, sometimes salts from strong acid and weak base can be acidic. So NH4Cl is such a case. Yes, that's right. The ammonium ion is a weak acid, so when it's in solution, it donates protons to water, making the solution acidic. Chloride is a spectator ion.\n\nSo I think A is correct. But let me check if any of the other options could be acidic. For example, maybe BaCl2? If the solution is neutral, then no. Unless there's some other hydrolysis. But Ba^2+ is a large cation, but since it's from a strong base, it doesn't hydrolyze. So no. So answer is A.\n</think>"}
