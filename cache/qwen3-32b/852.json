The chemist found a white solid in a bottle and has some spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let's look at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z = 156 (100%), and there's a peak at m/z = 158 (32%). I remember that when there's a difference of 2 in the m/z values, it might indicate the presence of a chlorine atom because chlorine has two isotopes: Cl-35 and Cl-37. The natural abundance ratio of Cl-35 to Cl-37 is about 3:1. So if the molecular ion peak is 156 and there's a peak at 158, that suggests the molecule contains one chlorine atom. Let me check the molar masses of the options to see which ones fit.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Phenyl chloroformate. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molar mass. Carbon is 12*7=84, hydrogen 5, chlorine 35.5, oxygen 16*2=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32 = 156.5. So that's close to 156. The peak at 158 would be due to the Cl-37 isotope, which is about 32% (since 35.5 is approximately 75.8% Cl-35 and 24.2% Cl-37; 24.2% of the molecular ion would be at 158, which is around 32% as given). So that fits.\n\nB: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as phenyl chloroformate? Wait, benzaldehyde has a CHO group. Let me count the atoms. Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO, which is C7H6O. If it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxy, then we replace a hydrogen with Cl and a hydrogen with OH. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. So same molar mass as A? So molar mass would be same. So both A and B would have same mass. But the problem is that the options are different structures.\n\nC: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula would be C8H6ClO2. Let me calculate: 8*12=96, H=6, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total is 96+6+35.5+32= 169.5. That's higher than 156, so not matching.\n\nD: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as C, just different position of Cl. So same molar mass, 169.5. So C and D are out because their molar masses are higher than 156. So possible answers are A and B.\n\nNow, moving to IR data. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a broad peak in the O-H region, which could be a carboxylic acid or alcohol, but the range from 3500-2700 is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid because alcohols usually have a sharper O-H peak around 3200-3600. However, carboxylic acids also have a broad O-H stretch, but the range from 2700 is more towards the lower end. Wait, maybe the 2700 is more about the carbonyl? Wait, no. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl stretch, which is typical for esters, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids. So the 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl. The broad peak from 3500-2700 is likely the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. But wait, phenyl chloroformate is an ester. Esters have a carbonyl group, but they don't have an O-H group. So if the compound is an ester, there shouldn't be an O-H stretch. However, phenyl chloroformate has a COOR group (ester), so the IR would have a carbonyl peak, but no O-H. But the IR here shows a broad peak in the O-H region, which suggests the presence of a hydroxyl group. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid? But the molecular mass of carboxylic acids like 4-chlorobenzoic acid is 169.5, which is higher than 156. So maybe the broad peak is from an alcohol? But the options A and B: phenyl chloroformate is an ester, so no O-H. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde has an OH group (since it's 2-hydroxy), so that would have an O-H stretch. So the broad peak in the IR would be from the OH group. But the 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl from the aldehyde (CHO group). So in option B, the IR would have both an O-H stretch and a carbonyl peak. That fits with the given IR data. So that would make option B a candidate. But option A is an ester, which would have a carbonyl but no O-H. So the presence of the O-H stretch in IR suggests that the compound has an OH group, which would be in option B, not A. So that would eliminate A and suggest B as the answer.\n\nNow looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). Let's analyze each of these.\n\nThe 11.0 ppm is a singlet for 1H. That's a very downfield signal, typical for a carboxylic acid (COOH) or an aldehyde proton (CHO). But carboxylic acids usually have around 10-12 ppm, and aldehydes around 9-10 ppm. However, in this case, the signal is a singlet. If it were a carboxylic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad singlet. If it's an aldehyde, the CHO proton could be a singlet if there's no adjacent protons to couple with. Let's check the options.\n\nOption B is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the structure would be a benzaldehyde ring with a Cl at position 3 and an OH at position 2. The CHO group would be at position 1. The NMR signal for the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but here it's at 11.0. That seems higher. However, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like Cl and OH could deshield the aldehyde proton, pushing it further downfield. So maybe 11.0 is plausible for the aldehyde proton here. But also, the OH proton could be around 1-5 ppm, but that's not the case here. The OH proton would be more upfield, but if it's involved in hydrogen bonding, it might be broader, but not at 11 ppm. So the 11 ppm is more likely the aldehyde proton.\n\nThen, the 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). These are aromatic protons. Let's think about the substitution pattern. The benzaldehyde ring (which is a benzene ring with a CHO group at position 1). If there's a Cl at position 3 and an OH at position 2, the aromatic protons would be affected by these substituents. Let me draw the structure mentally. The ring has CHO at position 1, OH at position 2, Cl at position 3. The aromatic protons would be positions 4, 5, 6. Let's see:\n\n- Position 4: adjacent to Cl and OH. The substituents would influence the chemical shift. The OH at position 2 is ortho to position 1 (CHO), and the Cl is at position 3, which is meta to CHO. The aromatic protons at positions 4 and 5 might be in different environments. Wait, maybe the two doublets are from para-substituted protons? Let me think. For a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring (CHO at 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3), the remaining positions are 4, 5, 6. Let's see:\n\nPosition 4 is para to the Cl (position 3), but also adjacent to the OH (position 2). The substituents at positions 2 and 3 would influence the protons at position 4. Similarly, positions 5 and 6. Hmm, maybe the two doublets come from two equivalent protons each. For example, if there are two protons that are each in a similar environment, leading to a doublet each. Let me think about the coupling. If there are two sets of protons that are each in a para position to each other, they might show coupling. Alternatively, maybe the protons at positions 4 and 6 are in similar environments, and position 5 is different. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about the substitution pattern.\n\nIn 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (also known as 3-chlorosalicylaldehyde), the structure is:\n\nCHO (position 1)\nOH (position 2)\nCl (position 3)\n\nThe remaining positions are 4, 5, 6. Let's look at the aromatic protons. The substituents at positions 2 and 3 would affect the protons at positions 4, 5, 6. \n\nPosition 4: adjacent to Cl (position 3) and opposite to OH (position 2). The substituent at position 2 (OH) is ortho to position 1 (CHO), but for position 4, it's meta to OH and para to Cl. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two doublets correspond to protons at positions 5 and 6. If the ring is 1-CHO, 2-OH, 3-Cl, then positions 4, 5, 6 would have different environments. Let me check the symmetry. The molecule is not symmetric, so the protons at 4, 5, 6 would be in different environments. However, the NMR shows two doublets each with 2H. That suggests two sets of equivalent protons. For example, maybe positions 5 and 6 are each in a similar environment. Let me think about the coupling. If there's a proton at position 5 and another at position 6, each might couple with a proton in the other position, leading to doublets. But if they are equivalent, they would show a singlet. Wait, but they are not equivalent. Alternatively, maybe there are two protons on adjacent carbons that are each coupled to each other. For example, if there are two protons on adjacent carbons that are each in a similar environment, but that might not explain the doublets. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets are from para protons. Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me check the possible splitting patterns.\n\nIn a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring (CHO, OH, Cl), the aromatic protons could have complex splitting, but the NMR data here shows two doublets each for 2H. A common pattern is that in a para-disubstituted ring, you get two doublets. For example, if there are two substituents opposite each other, leading to two equivalent protons each. But in this case, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 positions. Maybe the protons at positions 4 and 6 are in similar environments. Let me imagine the structure: CHO at 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3. Then position 4 is para to Cl (position 3), position 5 is meta to Cl and OH, and position 6 is para to OH (position 2). The protons at positions 4 and 6 might be in different environments. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets are from protons adjacent to the substituents. For example, the protons at positions 5 and 6, each adjacent to the Cl and OH. This is getting a bit too detailed. Maybe I should compare with the options.\n\nOption B is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The NMR data would have:\n\n- A singlet for the aldehyde proton (CHO) at around 10 ppm, which in this case is at 11.0 ppm (as given). That's plausible with the substituents causing deshielding.\n\n- The aromatic protons: Let's see, if there are two doublets each for 2H, that could be from two equivalent protons each. For example, in a para-substituted ring, but here the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. Maybe the protons at positions 5 and 6 are each in similar environments. Let's say the protons at positions 5 and 6 are each adjacent to the Cl and OH. If there's a Cl at position 3 and an OH at position 2, then position 5 is adjacent to Cl (position 3) and position 6 is adjacent to OH (position 2). Depending on the electronic effects, these protons could have different chemical shifts. However, if there's symmetry, maybe they are equivalent. Wait, the molecule is not symmetric because the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. So positions 4, 5, 6 would all be different. But the NMR shows two doublets for 2H each. That suggests two sets of equivalent protons. Maybe the protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent? If there's some symmetry. Let me check the structure again. If the molecule is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). The ring is not symmetric, so positions 4, 5, 6 are all different. Therefore, the aromatic protons should be three different sets. But the NMR data shows two doublets each for 2H. This is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are from para protons. Wait, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that some protons become equivalent. For example, if there's a Cl at position 3 and an OH at position 2, then positions 4 and 6 might be in similar environments if the substituents have similar effects. Alternatively, maybe the NMR data is simplified. Let me think about the splitting. If there are two protons that are each coupled to another proton, leading to doublets. For example, if there are two protons on adjacent carbons that are each coupled to each other, you get a doublet of doublets, but the data shows just doublets. Maybe it's a first-order splitting. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets are from two different pairs of protons that each have a single coupling. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two doublets are from the aromatic protons adjacent to the CHO group. The CHO is at position 1, so the protons at positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has an OH, so no proton there. So maybe positions 5 and 6? This is getting too confusing. Let me check the other options.\n\nOption D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula would be C8H6ClO2. Wait, but earlier we saw that the mass is 156, which doesn't match. So D is out. Option C is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, same issue. So only A and B left. \n\nPhenyl chloroformate (option A) is an ester. Its structure is O=C(OCl)Ph. The NMR would have a carbonyl (ester) group, but no O-H. The 1H NMR would have aromatic protons. Let's see: the ester group would have an OCOCl, but no aldehyde or carboxylic acid proton. So the 11.0 ppm signal would not be present if it's an ester. Therefore, the 11.0 ppm must be an aldehyde proton. So that points to option B.\n\nSo the 11.0 ppm is the aldehyde proton (CHO), which is present in option B but not in A. The IR data has a broad O-H stretch, which would be from the OH group in option B. The 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl from the aldehyde (CHO group). \n\nNow, the aromatic protons in option B: the two doublets each for 2H. Let's think about the substitution pattern. The ring has a CHO (position 1), OH (position 2), and Cl (position 3). The remaining protons are at positions 4, 5, 6. If we consider the effects of the substituents, the protons at positions 4 and 6 might be in similar environments if there's some symmetry. For example, position 4 is para to Cl (position 3), and position 6 is para to OH (position 2). Depending on the substituents, their chemical shifts could be different. However, if the NMR shows two doublets each for 2H, that could mean two equivalent protons each. For example, maybe positions 4 and 6 are each in a similar environment. Wait, but position 4 is para to Cl (electronegative), and position 6 is para to OH (which is also electronegative). If the OH is more electron-withdrawing than Cl, maybe their effects are different. However, the NMR data shows two doublets. Let's assume that there are two equivalent protons each. For example, maybe the protons at positions 5 and 6 are each in a similar environment. Alternatively, maybe there's coupling between protons on adjacent carbons. \n\nAnother approach: the two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm. The difference in chemical shift is about 0.3 ppm. In aromatic systems, adjacent protons can have splitting patterns. For example, in a para-substituted ring, you might get two doublets. But in this case, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. Let me think of a simpler case. If the ring is 1-CHO, 2-OH, 3-Cl, then the aromatic protons would be at positions 4, 5, 6. Let's assign:\n\n- Position 4: para to Cl (position 3), so influenced by Cl.\n\n- Position 5: adjacent to Cl (position 3) and OH (position 2).\n\n- Position 6: para to OH (position 2), so influenced by OH.\n\nSo the protons at positions 4 and 6 would each have different chemical shifts. The protons at position 5 would be in a unique environment. However, the NMR shows only two doublets for 2H each, which suggests that two of the positions have equivalent protons. This might happen if there's a symmetry or if the substituents create similar environments. For example, if the Cl and OH have similar electronic effects on different positions. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets are from protons at positions 5 and 6. If the Cl and OH are both electron-withdrawing, maybe the protons at positions 5 and 6 are in similar environments. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two doublets are from protons adjacent to the CHO group. The CHO is at position 1, so the protons at position 2 (but that's OH), position 6. Position 6 is adjacent to position 5 and 7 (but 7 is position 1, which is CHO). Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should accept that the NMR data fits with option B because of the presence of the aldehyde proton at 11 ppm and the O-H stretch in IR, which are not present in option A. The aromatic protons' splitting might be due to the specific substitution pattern. \n\nSo putting it all together: the mass spectrum suggests a molecular ion of 156 with a Cl isotope, which fits options A and B. The IR data suggests an O-H stretch (from OH in B) and a carbonyl (from aldehyde in B). The NMR has an aldehyde proton at 11 ppm (CHO) and aromatic protons with two doublets. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.\n</think>"}
