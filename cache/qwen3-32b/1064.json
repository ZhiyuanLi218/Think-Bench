The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², which is like a spring force obeying Hooke's law. The options are given as A, B, C, D. Let me start by recalling what I know about the 3D harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels determined by the quantum numbers. In three dimensions, the energy levels are usually given by the formula E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2,...). But since the potential is isotropic (same in all directions), the energy depends only on the total quantum number N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy can be written as E_N = ħω(N + 3/2), where N = 0, 1, 2,...\n\nWait, so each energy level is labeled by N, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers. The ground state is when N=0, so E_0 = (3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be N=1, so E_1 = (5/2)ħω. Then N=2 would be the second excited state with E_2 = (7/2)ħω, and N=3 would be the third excited state with E_3 = (9/2)ħω. But let me check: ground state is N=0 (lowest energy), first excited is N=1, second N=2, third N=3. So third excited state would be N=3? Wait, sometimes people count excited states as n ≥1, so maybe the third excited is N=3? Let me confirm.\n\nIn general, the nth energy level (with n starting at 0) has energy E_n = ħω(2n + 3/2)? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, for 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are actually E = ħω(2n + l + 3/2)? No, that might be for other systems. Wait, no, in the standard 3D harmonic oscillator, when it's isotropic, the energy levels are degenerate and depend on the total number of quanta N = 2n + l, but maybe I need to think in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers.\n\nActually, in the 3D case, when you separate variables into Cartesian coordinates, each direction is a 1D harmonic oscillator. So the total energy is the sum of the energies from each direction. Each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2)ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that direction. Therefore, total energy is [ (n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) + (n_z + 1/2) ] ħω = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Let me define N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then E_N = (N + 3/2) ħω. So each energy level is labeled by N, which is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2,...). The ground state is N=0 (all n_i=0). The first excited state is N=1, which can be achieved by having one of the n_i=1 and the others 0. The second excited state is N=2, which can be achieved by either one of the n_i=2 and others 0, or two of the n_i=1 and one 0. The third excited state would be N=3. Therefore, the energy for N=3 is E_3 = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that would correspond to option A or B, since both A and B have energy (9/2)ħω. The options C and D have different energies involving π² and r² in the denominator, which seems odd because energy shouldn't depend on r in this case. The potential is V(r) proportional to r², but the energy levels are quantized and do not depend on a specific r; they are eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, options C and D are likely incorrect because they have energy expressions with r² in the denominator, which would not be correct. So we can eliminate C and D.\n\nNow, between A and B, the difference is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for that energy. Option A says 10, option B says 3. So I need to compute the degeneracy of the N=3 level in the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe degeneracy of a given N in 3D harmonic oscillator is the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x + n_y + n_z = N. This is a combinatorial problem. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N is (N + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) = (N + 2 choose 2). Wait, that's the formula for combinations with repetition. The formula is (N + k - 1 choose k - 1) where k is the number of variables. Here k=3, so (N + 2 choose 2). Let me check for N=0: (0 + 2 choose 2) = 1, which is correct. For N=1: (1 + 2 choose 2) = 3, which is correct (three states: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)). For N=2: (2 + 2 choose 2) = 6. Let's see: (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). Yes, six states. For N=3: (3 + 2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. Therefore, the degeneracy is 10. Therefore, the third excited state (N=3) has 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions. Therefore, the correct answer would be option A: (9/2)ħω, 10. But let me make sure that N=3 is indeed the third excited state.\n\nLet me count the energy levels again. Ground state: N=0, first excited: N=1, second: N=2, third: N=3. Yes, so third excited state is N=3. Therefore, energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω, degeneracy 10. Therefore, answer A.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Sometimes people use different notations for excited states. For example, in some contexts, the \"third excited state\" might refer to the third state above the ground state, which would be N=3. But if someone counts the ground state as the 0th state, then the first excited is N=1, second N=2, third N=3. So yes, that seems right. Therefore, answer A.\n\nBut let me also think about another approach. In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can also be expressed in terms of the angular momentum quantum number l. However, in the isotropic case, the energy depends only on N = 2n + l, where n is the radial quantum number? Wait, no, perhaps that's more complicated. Maybe that approach is more involved. But since we already have the degeneracy from the Cartesian approach as 10 for N=3, and that seems straightforward, I think that is the right way.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of spherical coordinates and separation of variables, the solutions are given by products of Laguerre polynomials and spherical harmonics. The energy levels depend on the quantum numbers n_r (radial) and l (angular momentum), with E = ħω(2n_r + l + 3/2). But since the potential is isotropic, different combinations of n_r and l that give the same N = 2n_r + l will have the same energy. For each N, which is a non-negative integer, the degeneracy is the number of (n_r, l) pairs such that 2n_r + l = N. However, for each such pair, the degeneracy also includes the degeneracy of the angular momentum part, which is (2l + 1). Therefore, the total degeneracy for each N is the sum over all possible l of (2l + 1), where l = N - 2n_r, with n_r = 0, 1, ..., floor(N/2). But this seems more complicated, but let's check for N=3.\n\nFor N=3, possible l values:\n\nIf n_r=0, then l=3. Then angular momentum degeneracy is 2*3 + 1 = 7.\n\nIf n_r=1, then l = 3 - 2*1 = 1. Then angular momentum degeneracy is 2*1 + 1 = 3.\n\nIf n_r=2, l = 3 - 2*2 = -1, which is invalid. So only n_r=0 and 1 contribute. Therefore total degeneracy is 7 + 3 = 10. Which matches the previous result from the Cartesian approach. Therefore, the degeneracy is indeed 10. Therefore, answer A is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: (9/2)ħω, 10.\n\nBut let me check once more for N=3. The possible states in Cartesian coordinates are all the permutations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that their sum is 3. Let's list them:\n\n- (3,0,0) and permutations: there are 3 permutations (since the 3 can be in x, y, or z).\n\n- (2,1,0) and permutations: the numbers 2,1,0 can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways, since all three numbers are distinct.\n\n- (1,1,1): only one way, since all are the same.\n\nSo total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Yes, that's 10. Therefore, degeneracy is 10. So answer A is correct. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
