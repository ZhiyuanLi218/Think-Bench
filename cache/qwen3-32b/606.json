So, the question is to find the value of k such that (3^k)^6 equals 3^6. Hmm, let me start by recalling some exponent rules because I think that's what I need here. \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, like (a^m)^n, you can multiply the exponents. So, that would make it a^(m*n). Let me verify that... Yeah, I think that's right. For example, (2^2)^3 is 2^(2*3) = 2^6, which is 64, and if you compute (4)^3, it's also 64. So that rule seems to hold. \n\nApplying that to the problem here, (3^k)^6 should be equal to 3^(k*6), right? Which is the same as 3^(6k). And according to the equation given, this is equal to 3^6. So we have 3^(6k) = 3^6. \n\nNow, if the bases are the same and the two expressions are equal, then their exponents must be equal as well. That is, if a^b = a^c, then b = c, provided that a is not 0 or 1 or something. Since 3 is definitely not 0 or 1, this rule should hold. \n\nTherefore, setting the exponents equal to each other: 6k = 6. To solve for k, I just need to divide both sides by 6. Let me do that. 6k divided by 6 is k, and 6 divided by 6 is 1. So, k = 1. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my work to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake. \n\nOriginal equation: (3^k)^6 = 3^6. Substitute k = 1: (3^1)^6 = 3^6. Simplify left side: 3^(1*6) = 3^6. Which is 3^6 = 3^6. Yep, that checks out. \n\nBut let me think again if there's another possible solution. For example, sometimes with exponents, there might be multiple solutions if we consider complex numbers or negative exponents, but since the problem is presented in a basic algebra context, I think we're dealing with real numbers here and positive integers maybe. \n\nAlso, considering that 3^k must be a real number, and since 3 is positive, any real exponent k would be valid. However, the equation 3^(6k) = 3^6 still only requires that 6k = 6, so k = 1. There's no other solution here because the function 3^x is one-to-one. That means each output corresponds to exactly one input. Therefore, there are no other k values that satisfy this equation. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose if there was a case where exponents differ by a multiple of the period of some function? But in real numbers, exponential functions with base not equal to 1 are one-to-one, so no, there's no periodicity. For example, in complex numbers, exponents can have multiple values due to periodicity of angles, but again, unless specified, we assume this is in real numbers. \n\nTherefore, k must equal 1. \n\nIs there any chance that maybe the original problem was written incorrectly? Let me check again. It says (3^k)^6 = 3^6. If someone misread it as 3^(k^6), that would be different, but no, the way it's written is (3^k)^6. \n\nAlternatively, if the equation was (3^k)^6 = 3^something else. But no, according to the user, it's 3^6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Let me think. For example, if 3^(6k) = 3^6, so 6k ≡ 6 mod something? But in real numbers, exponents don't work with modular arithmetic unless we're dealing with integers. But since 3^x is defined for real numbers, and it's one-to-one, the exponents have to be exactly equal. Therefore, 6k must equal 6. \n\nTherefore, k = 1. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was in a context where k is supposed to be something else, but the problem just says \"find k\", so I think k is just 1. \n\nLet me try plugging in another number just to see. Suppose k was 2. Then (3^2)^6 = 3^(12), which is way bigger than 3^6. If k was 0, then (3^0)^6 = 1^6 = 1, which is 3^0, not 3^6. If k was 1/6, then (3^(1/6))^6 = 3^(1) = 3, which is 3^1, not 3^6. If k was something like 1 + something, maybe? Let's try k = 1 + 1 = 2, but we saw that gives 3^12. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe negative exponents? Let's try k = -1. Then (3^-1)^6 = 3^(-6) = 1/(3^6), which is not equal to 3^6. So no. \n\nSo yeah, seems like k has to be 1. \n\nWait, but just to think again, maybe there's a case where exponents are equal modulo something? But again, unless we're working in a discrete logarithm or modular arithmetic context, which isn't indicated here, there's no need to consider that. \n\nTherefore, I think confidently that k = 1 is the correct answer. \n\nBut just to recap the steps formally:\n\nGiven: (3^k)^6 = 3^6\n\nApply power rule: 3^(6k) = 3^6\n\nSince bases are equal, set exponents equal: 6k = 6\n\nDivide both sides by 6: k = 1\n\nYes, that's solid. \n\nI think that's it. There's no trick here, just applying exponent rules. Maybe the problem is testing whether someone knows how to handle exponents raised to exponents, and then equating them. \n\nAnother way someone might get confused is if they thought you add exponents instead of multiplying. For example, if someone thought (a^m)^n = a^(m + n), which is wrong, but if they did that, they would have 3^(k + 6) = 3^6, leading to k + 6 = 6, so k = 0. But that's incorrect because the operation when you raise a power to a power is multiplication, not addition. Addition comes into play when you multiply two powers with the same base: a^m * a^n = a^(m + n). But here, it's a power to a power, so multiplication. \n\nSo if someone made that mistake, they might think k is 0, but that's wrong. But since we've correctly applied the power rule, we know it's 6k, leading to k = 1. \n\nAlternatively, if someone overcomplicates it by taking logarithms. Let's try that approach for verification. \n\nStarting with (3^k)^6 = 3^6. Take natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nln[(3^k)^6] = ln(3^6)\n\nUsing logarithm power rule: 6 * ln(3^k) = 6 * ln(3)\n\nThen, 6 * k * ln(3) = 6 * ln(3)\n\nDivide both sides by 6: k * ln(3) = ln(3)\n\nDivide both sides by ln(3): k = 1\n\nSame result. So even with logarithms, we get k = 1. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, k = 1 is the solution. \n\nSo, yeah, I think that's thorough. I don't see any other angle to approach this problem from. It seems pretty straightforward once you recall the exponent rules. \n\nAnother check: Let me compute both sides numerically with k=1. \n\nLeft side: (3^1)^6 = 3^6 = 729. \n\nRight side: 3^6 = 729. \n\nYep, equal. \n\nIf I try k=1/ something, like k=2/6=1/3. Then left side is (3^(1/3))^6 = 3^(6*(1/3))=3^2=9. Which is not 729. \n\nIf k=6/6=1, as we saw, it works. \n\nAlternatively, if k was 6, then left side is (3^6)^6=3^(36), which is way bigger. \n\nSo, yeah, k=1 is the only solution. \n\nTherefore, I think confidently the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ k $ is \\boxed{1}.\n</think>"}
