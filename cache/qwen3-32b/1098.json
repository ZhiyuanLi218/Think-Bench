According to the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W, when ΔU = 0 (isothermal process), Q = W, which means the heat absorbed by the gas can be completely converted into work. Therefore, A is correct.","Step 2: Analyze option B: When the volume of the gas increases, its internal energy must decrease. This is incorrect. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy ΔU = Q - W. When the volume of the gas increases and work is done (W > 0), the internal energy can increase if enough heat is absorbed (Q > W). Even though the internal energy indeed decreases during adiabatic expansion, this is not the case in all situations. Therefore, B is incorrect.","Step 3: Analyze option C: The gas absorbs heat from the outside, and its internal energy must increase. This is incorrect. According to the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W. Even if the gas absorbs heat (Q > 0), if work is done at the same time and W > Q, the internal energy may still decrease. For example, during isothermal expansion, ΔU = 0. Therefore, C is wrong.","Step 4: Analyze option D: Work is done on the gas by the surroundings, and the internal energy of the gas may decrease. When work is done on the gas by the surroundings, W < 0 (negative work). According to the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W = Q + |W|. If the gas simultaneously releases heat to the surroundings and |Q| > |W|, then ΔU may be negative, reducing the internal energy. Therefore, D is correct.","Step 5: Comprehensive analysis, options A and D are correct, the answer is AD."]}},"question_type":"Easy","category":"physics","subcategory":"thermodynamics","prediction":"To determine which of the given statements about a certain amount of gas are correct, we must apply the **first law of thermodynamics**:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ \\Delta U $ is the change in internal energy,\n- $ Q $ is the heat added to the system,\n- $ W $ is the work done **by** the system.\n\nLet’s analyze each option carefully:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: \"The heat absorbed by the gas can be completely converted into work.\"**\n\nThis is **correct** in the context of an **isothermal expansion** of an **ideal gas**.

So, the question is about which statements are correct regarding a certain amount of gas, and there are four options: A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which ones are correct based on the first law of thermodynamics and other related concepts.\n\nFirst, let me recall the first law of thermodynamics: ΔU = Q - W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system. Sometimes different textbooks use different sign conventions, so I need to be careful. In some cases, W is the work done on the system, so the formula becomes ΔU = Q + W. But I think the standard one is ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. Let me stick with that for now.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: \"The heat absorbed by the gas can be completely converted into work.\" Hmm. So, is there a scenario where all the heat added to the gas is converted into work? Well, in a cyclic process, like in a heat engine, some heat is converted into work, but not all of it. The second law of thermodynamics says that it's impossible to convert heat completely into work without some other effect. But wait, maybe in a specific process, like an isothermal expansion? For an ideal gas undergoing isothermal expansion, the internal energy doesn't change (ΔU = 0), so all the heat absorbed is converted into work. So Q = W. In that case, the heat absorbed is completely converted into work. But does that violate the second law? I think the second law says that you can't have a process where heat is completely converted into work with no other effect. In an isothermal process, the gas is in contact with a thermal reservoir, so heat is transferred, and work is done. But it's a part of a cycle, maybe. Wait, if it's a cycle, then over the entire cycle, you can't have 100% efficiency. But for a single process, like isothermal expansion, you can have Q = W. So in that case, the heat absorbed is completely converted into work. So maybe option A is correct?\n\nBut wait, the second law says that you cannot have a process whose sole result is the absorption of heat and conversion into work. But in an isothermal expansion, the gas is absorbing heat and doing work, but it's not the sole result because the gas is also changing its state (expanding). So maybe it's allowed. So maybe A is correct. I need to check this.\n\nOption B: \"When the volume of the gas increases, its internal energy must decrease.\" Hmm. The internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature. For real gases, it also depends on volume and pressure, but assuming this is about an ideal gas. So if the volume increases, what about the internal energy? It depends on the process. For example, in an isothermal expansion, the internal energy doesn't change. In an adiabatic expansion, if the gas is expanding and doing work, then the internal energy decreases because Q = 0, so ΔU = -W. But if the gas is expanding while absorbing heat, maybe the internal energy could increase or decrease depending on the balance between heat and work. So the internal energy doesn't necessarily decrease when volume increases. Therefore, statement B is not necessarily correct. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"When the gas absorbs heat from the outside, its internal energy must increase.\" Again, using ΔU = Q - W. If the gas absorbs heat (Q positive), but if it does a lot of work (W positive), then ΔU could be positive or negative. For example, if the gas absorbs heat but does more work than the heat added, then ΔU would be negative. So internal energy doesn't have to increase. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"When work is done on the gas by the outside, the gas's internal energy may decrease.\" Let's think. If work is done on the gas, then in the formula ΔU = Q + W (if W is work done on the gas). But using the first formula where W is work done by the gas, then if work is done on the gas, W would be negative. Let me clarify. Let's stick with ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the gas. So if work is done on the gas, then W is negative. So ΔU = Q - (-W_on) = Q + W_on. So if work is done on the gas, then ΔU depends on Q and W_on. So if work is done on the gas, but the gas is losing heat, then it's possible that ΔU could decrease. For example, suppose W_on is positive (work done on the gas), but Q is negative (heat lost by the gas). If the magnitude of Q is greater than the work done on the gas, then ΔU could be negative. So yes, internal energy may decrease. So D is correct.\n\nSo from the options, A and D are correct? Wait, but let me check again.\n\nOption A: In an isothermal process, Q is converted entirely into work. So the heat absorbed is completely converted into work. So A is correct. But the second law says that you can't have a 100% efficient heat engine, but that's over a cycle. In a single process, like isothermal expansion, it's allowed. So A is correct.\n\nSo options A and D are correct. Let me check the options again. The original question is in Chinese, but the options are labeled A to D. The answer options are probably multiple choice, but the user hasn't specified if it's multiple correct. Wait, the original question says \"the following statements are correct ( ) Options: (A)... (B)... (C)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So maybe it's multiple correct. But in Chinese exams, sometimes they use letters with parentheses. Let me check again.\n\nIf the options are A to D, and the correct ones are A and D, then the answer would be AD. But I need to confirm again.\n\nOption A: Heat absorbed can be completely converted into work. As in isothermal process. So yes.\n\nOption D: When work is done on the gas, internal energy may decrease. Yes, if the gas loses heat. For example, if you compress the gas (work done on it) but it loses more heat than the work done, then ΔU is negative. So D is correct.\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect. So the correct answers are A and D. But let me check if there are any other possibilities.\n\nWait, for option A, in the case of a cyclic process, the net internal energy change is zero, but during parts of the cycle, heat can be converted to work. However, the statement says \"the heat absorbed by the gas can be completely converted into work.\" So in an isothermal process, which is part of a cycle (like in Carnot cycle), during the isothermal expansion, the heat absorbed is converted into work. But the entire cycle can't do that. But the statement is about a certain amount of gas undergoing a process, not necessarily a cycle. So A is correct.\n\nSo the correct options are A and D. Therefore, the answer should be A and D. But I need to check the options again. The original options are (A) to (D), and the user is to choose from them. In some exams, multiple choices are allowed. However, in Chinese exams, sometimes the options are single-choice, but sometimes multiple. Since the user hasn't specified, but given the way the question is presented, perhaps it's multiple correct. So the correct answers are A and D.\n\nBut let me check once more.\n\nOption B: When volume increases, internal energy must decrease. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. So if the volume increases but temperature increases more, then internal energy increases. For example, in an isobaric expansion, temperature increases, so internal energy increases even though volume increases. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: When gas absorbs heat, internal energy must increase. As discussed, if the gas absorbs heat but does work, depending on the amount, the internal energy could increase or decrease. For example, if Q is positive and W is positive (work done by gas), then ΔU = Q - W. If Q < W, then ΔU is negative. So C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and D. However, looking back at the options, maybe the original question expects only one correct answer? But according to my analysis, both A and D are correct. Let me check standard thermodynamics concepts again.\n\nFor option A: In an isothermal process for an ideal gas, ΔU = 0, so Q = W. So all the heat absorbed is converted into work. So yes, that's possible. Therefore, A is correct.\n\nFor option D: When work is done on the gas, internal energy may decrease. For example, if the gas is compressed (work done on it) but it loses heat. Let's take numbers. Suppose work done on the gas is +10 J (so W_by = -10 J). Suppose heat lost by the gas is -20 J. Then ΔU = Q - W_by = (-20) - (-10) = -10 J. So internal energy decreases. Hence, D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and D. If the options are multiple-select, then AD. But I need to check if the original question allows multiple answers. Since the user provided the options as (A) to (D), and the answer is to choose from A to D, but didn't specify if multiple are correct. In Chinese exams, sometimes the options are single-choice, but sometimes multiple. Given that the options include both A and D as correct, I think the answer is A and D. However, looking at the original problem again, maybe there's a trick.\n\nWait, option A says \"the heat absorbed by the gas can be completely converted into work.\" In thermodynamics, the second law (Kelvin-Planck statement) says that it's impossible to have a process whose sole result is the absorption of heat and conversion into work. But in an isothermal process, the gas is in contact with a heat reservoir, so it's not the sole result because there's also the expansion. Therefore, it's allowed. Hence, A is correct. So the answer should include A and D.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and D. So the answer is AD. However, depending on the exam's format, sometimes options are labeled with letters, and if it's multiple correct, you have to select all. Since the user hasn't specified, but in the original problem statement, the options are listed with (A) to (D), and the answer should be given as \"Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\", likely expecting letters like AD.\n\nBut let me check once more for any possible mistakes. For example, if the gas is ideal, then internal energy is a function of temperature only. So for option A, during isothermal process, yes. For option D, yes. So I think my analysis is correct.\n</think>"}
