Let me start by writing down the unbalanced equation again to make sure I have it right: K + B₂O₃ → K₂O + B.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the elements involved: potassium (K), boron (B), and oxygen (O). The goal is to have the same number of each element on both sides of the equation.\n\nStarting with the left side (reactants): \n- Potassium (K): 1 atom\n- Boron (B): 2 atoms\n- Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n\nOn the right side (products):\n- Potassium (K): 2 atoms in K₂O\n- Boron (B): 1 atom\n- Oxygen (O): 1 atom in K₂O\n\nSo, the first step is to balance the elements that appear in only one compound on each side. Oxygen might be a good starting point here because it's in B₂O₃ on the left and K₂O on the right. Let me see.\n\nIf I look at oxygen, there are 3 O on the left and 1 O on the right. To balance oxygen, I can put a coefficient of 3 in front of K₂O. That would give me 3 O on both sides. Let me try that:\n\nK + B₂O₃ → 3K₂O + B\n\nNow checking oxygen: 3 on left, 3 on right (from 3K₂O). Good.\n\nNext, let's check potassium. On the left, we still have 1 K. On the right, 3K₂O has 3×2=6 K. So we need 6 K on the left. Let's put a 6 in front of K:\n\n6K + B₂O₃ → 3K₂O + B\n\nNow potassium is balanced: 6 on both sides.\n\nNow boron. On the left, B₂O₃ has 2 B. On the right, we have B. To balance boron, we need 2 B on the right. So put a 2 in front of B:\n\n6K + B₂O₃ → 3K₂O + 2B\n\nNow check boron: 2 on left, 2 on right. Good.\n\nLet me verify all elements again:\n\nLeft side:\n- K: 6\n- B: 2\n- O: 3\n\nRight side:\n- K: 3×2 = 6\n- B: 2\n- O: 3×1 = 3\n\nAll elements are balanced now. So the balanced equation is 6K + B₂O₃ → 3K₂O + 2B. Looking at the options given:\n\nA: 4K + B₂O₃ → 2K₂O + B  \nB: 2K + B₂O₃ → K₂O + 4B  \nC: 3K + B₂O₃ → K₂O + 3B  \nD: 6K + B₂O₃ → 3K₂O + 2B\n\nSo option D is the correct one. Let me double-check the coefficients again just to be sure.\n\nYes, 6K on the left, 3K₂O (which is 6K) on the right. Boron: 2 on left, 2 on right. Oxygen: 3 on both sides. Perfect. So D is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
