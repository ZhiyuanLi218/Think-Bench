So, the question is about finding the molar concentration of iodine vapor when HI dissociates. The equilibrium constant Kc is given as 21, and we have 15 grams of HI in a 12.0-liter flask. The answer choices are given, so I need to work through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the equilibrium constant expression for a reaction is the concentrations of the products over the reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. The reaction here is the dissociation of HI into hydrogen gas and iodine vapor. Let me write that down.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the dissociation of HI is:\n2 HI(g) ⇌ H₂(g) + I₂(g)\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant Kc is given by:\nKc = [H₂][I₂] / [HI]²\n\nGiven that Kc is 21 at this temperature. Now, the problem is to find the molar concentration of iodine vapor (I₂) at equilibrium.\n\nFirst, I need to find the initial concentration of HI. The problem states that 15 grams of HI is introduced into a 12.0-L flask. Let me calculate the number of moles of HI first.\n\nThe molar mass of HI: Hydrogen is about 1.008 g/mol, and Iodine is about 126.90 g/mol. So, total molar mass is approximately 1.008 + 126.90 = 127.908 g/mol. Let me check that again. Wait, HI is H and I. Yeah, so 1.008 + 126.90 = 127.908 g/mol. So, 15 grams divided by that molar mass gives moles.\n\nCalculating moles of HI: 15 g / 127.908 g/mol ≈ let me compute that. Let me do 15 divided by 127.908. Let me approximate 127.908 as 128 for easier calculation. 15/128 ≈ 0.117 mol. But since I approximated the molar mass as 128 instead of 127.908, the actual value might be slightly higher. Let me do the exact calculation.\n\n127.908 g/mol is the exact molar mass. So:\n\n15 g / 127.908 g/mol ≈ 15 / 127.908 ≈ 0.1173 moles. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\n127.908 * 0.1 = 12.7908 g\n\n127.908 * 0.11 = 12.7908 + 1.27908 = 14.06988 g\n\n127.908 * 0.117 ≈ 14.06988 + 127.908*0.007 ≈ 14.06988 + 0.895 ≈ 14.96488 g\n\nSo 0.117 moles would be about 14.96 grams. But we have 15 grams, so the exact moles would be approximately 0.1173 + (15 - 14.96)/127.908 ≈ 0.1173 + 0.04/127.908 ≈ 0.1173 + 0.00031 ≈ 0.1176 moles. So approximately 0.1176 moles of HI.\n\nBut maybe I should just use exact numbers here. Let me use a calculator for more precision. Wait, since I don't have a calculator, maybe I can compute 15 / 127.908.\n\nLet me write 15 / 127.908 ≈ Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3: 5 / 42.636 ≈ 0.1172. So approximately 0.1172 moles. So about 0.1172 moles in 12.0 liters. Therefore, the initial concentration of HI is:\n\n[HI] initial = 0.1172 mol / 12.0 L ≈ 0.00977 M. Wait, 0.1172 divided by 12 is approximately 0.00977 M. Let me check:\n\n0.1172 / 12 = 0.009766... So approximately 0.00977 M. Let me note that as 0.00977 M. So that's the initial concentration of HI.\n\nNow, the reaction is 2 HI ⇌ H₂ + I₂. So, let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[HI] = 0.00977 M\n[H₂] = 0\n[I₂] = 0\n\nChange:\nLet me let the change be that x is the amount of H₂ and I₂ formed. Since the stoichiometry is 2 HI decomposing to 1 H₂ and 1 I₂, then for every 2 moles of HI consumed, 1 mole of H₂ and 1 mole of I₂ are produced. Therefore, the change in HI is -2x, and the change in H₂ and I₂ is +x each.\n\nTherefore, at equilibrium:\n\n[HI] = 0.00977 - 2x\n\n[H₂] = x\n\n[I₂] = x\n\nNow, plug into the equilibrium expression:\n\nKc = [H₂][I₂] / [HI]^2 = (x)(x) / (0.00977 - 2x)^2 = x² / (0.00977 - 2x)^2 = 21\n\nSo, sqrt both sides? Let me think. Taking square roots on both sides:\n\nsqrt(x² / (0.00977 - 2x)^2) = sqrt(21)\n\nWhich is |x / (0.00977 - 2x)| = sqrt(21) ≈ 4.5837\n\nAssuming that x is positive and since concentrations can't be negative, we can drop the absolute value:\n\nx / (0.00977 - 2x) = 4.5837\n\nBut wait, the denominator is 0.00977 - 2x. If x is positive, then 0.00977 - 2x must also be positive because concentrations can't be negative. Therefore:\n\n0.00977 - 2x > 0 => 2x < 0.00977 => x < 0.004885 M\n\nSo, solving the equation:\n\nx = 4.5837*(0.00977 - 2x)\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nx = 4.5837 * 0.00977 - 4.5837 * 2x\n\nCalculate 4.5837 * 0.00977 first. Let me approximate:\n\n4.5837 * 0.00977 ≈ Let me compute 4.5837 * 0.01 = 0.045837, but since it's 0.00977, which is 0.01 - 0.00023. So, approximately 0.045837 - 4.5837 * 0.00023 ≈ 0.045837 - 0.001054 ≈ 0.044783 M.\n\nSo, approximately 0.04478 M.\n\nThen:\n\nx ≈ 0.04478 - 9.1674x\n\nBring the 9.1674x to the left:\n\nx + 9.1674x ≈ 0.04478\n\n10.1674x ≈ 0.04478\n\nTherefore, x ≈ 0.04478 / 10.1674 ≈ 0.004404 M\n\nWait, let me check that division:\n\nDividing 0.04478 by 10.1674. Let me approximate 0.04478 / 10.1674 ≈ 0.0044. Let me compute 10.1674 * 0.0044 = 0.044735. Which is very close to 0.04478. So, x ≈ 0.0044 M.\n\nBut wait, earlier we had that x must be less than 0.004885 M. So, 0.0044 is less than that, so that's okay. Therefore, x ≈ 0.0044 M. Therefore, the concentration of I₂ at equilibrium is x ≈ 0.0044 M, which is 4.4 × 10^-3 M. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 4.4 × 10^-3 M. So, that would be the answer? But let me check if my approximations are valid here.\n\nWait, let me verify my calculations again because I approximated some steps. Let me redo the calculation with more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, let's recast the equation:\n\nx / (0.00977 - 2x) = 4.5837\n\nSo, solving for x:\n\nx = 4.5837*(0.00977 - 2x)\n\nLet me compute 4.5837 * 0.00977 more accurately.\n\nFirst, 4.5837 * 0.00977:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n4 * 0.00977 = 0.03908\n\n0.5837 * 0.00977 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 * 0.00977 = 0.004885\n\n0.0837 * 0.00977 ≈ approx 0.000817\n\nAdding up: 0.004885 + 0.000817 ≈ 0.005702\n\nSo total is 0.03908 + 0.005702 ≈ 0.044782 M. So that part is accurate.\n\nThen, x = 0.044782 - 9.1674x\n\nSo, x + 9.1674x = 0.044782 => 10.1674x = 0.044782 => x = 0.044782 / 10.1674 ≈\n\nLet me do this division more precisely. Let me write 0.044782 divided by 10.1674.\n\nFirst, note that 10.1674 × 0.0044 = 10.1674 × 0.004 + 10.1674 × 0.0004\n\n= 0.0406696 + 0.00406696 ≈ 0.04473656\n\nWhich is very close to 0.044782. The difference is 0.044782 - 0.04473656 ≈ 0.00004544.\n\nSo, to find a more accurate value, we can do:\n\nLet me denote x ≈ 0.0044 + (0.00004544 / 10.1674)\n\n≈ 0.0044 + 0.00000447 ≈ 0.00440447 M.\n\nTherefore, x ≈ 0.004404 M. So approximately 0.00440 M. Therefore, the concentration of I₂ is x ≈ 0.00440 M, which is 4.4 × 10^-3 M. So option C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the assumption that the square root gives us the positive value is correct. Also, let me verify if the quadratic equation is necessary here. Because when I took square roots, I assumed that x/(0.00977 - 2x) is positive, which it is, but maybe there's another solution? Let me check.\n\nThe equation was x² / (0.00977 - 2x)^2 = 21. Taking square roots gives x/(0.00977 - 2x) = ±√21. But since concentrations can't be negative, we have to check if negative solution makes sense.\n\nIf we take the negative root: x/(0.00977 - 2x) = -4.5837. Let's see what that would imply.\n\nx = -4.5837*(0.00977 - 2x)\n\nx = -4.5837*0.00977 + 9.1674x\n\nBring terms together:\n\nx - 9.1674x = -4.5837*0.00977\n\n-8.1674x ≈ -0.04478\n\nx ≈ (-0.04478)/(-8.1674) ≈ 0.005485 M\n\nBut let's check if this value satisfies the original equation. Let me plug x ≈ 0.005485 into the original equation.\n\nFirst, check if 0.00977 - 2x is positive. 2x = 0.01097 M. Then 0.00977 - 0.01097 = -0.0012 M. Negative concentration, which is impossible. Therefore, this solution is invalid. Therefore, only the positive root is valid. Therefore, x ≈ 0.00440 M is the correct value.\n\nBut let me verify by plugging x = 0.0044 into the original Kc expression.\n\nCompute [HI] at equilibrium: 0.00977 - 2x = 0.00977 - 2*(0.0044) = 0.00977 - 0.0088 = 0.00097 M.\n\nThen, Kc = (x^2)/([HI]^2) = (0.0044)^2 / (0.00097)^2 ≈ (0.00001936) / (0.0000009409) ≈ 20.58. Which is approximately 21. Considering that we approximated x as 0.0044, which gave Kc ≈ 20.58, which is close to 21. So, perhaps there is a slight approximation here. Maybe we need to do a more accurate calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should solve the quadratic equation without approximating. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from:\n\nx² / (0.00977 - 2x)^2 = 21\n\nTake square roots:\n\nx / (0.00977 - 2x) = ±√21 ≈ ±4.5837\n\nAs before, we take the positive root:\n\nx = 4.5837*(0.00977 - 2x)\n\nWhich led us to x ≈ 0.00440 M. But perhaps there is a more accurate way.\n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\nx = 4.5837*(0.00977 - 2x)\n\nWhich we did, leading to x ≈ 0.00440 M. However, since our approximate calculation gives Kc ≈ 20.58 instead of 21, maybe we need to do a better approximation.\n\nLet me denote the exact equation:\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nx² / (0.00977 - 2x)^2 = 21\n\nLet me let’s denote y = 0.00977 - 2x. Then, the equation becomes ( ( (y - 0.00977)/-2 )^2 ) / y² = 21. Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\nx² = 21*(0.00977 - 2x)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nx² = 21*(0.00977² - 2*0.00977*2x + (2x)^2)\n\nWait, expanding (a - b)^2 where a = 0.00977 and b = 2x:\n\n(a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b²\n\nTherefore:\n\nx² = 21*(a² - 4a x + 4x²)\n\nWhere a = 0.00977\n\nSo:\n\nx² = 21a² - 84a x + 84x²\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nx² - 84x² + 84a x - 21a² = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-83x² + 84a x - 21a² = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n83x² - 84a x + 21a² = 0\n\nSo, quadratic equation in x:\n\n83x² - 84a x + 21a² = 0\n\nWhere a = 0.00977\n\nLet me compute the coefficients:\n\nLet me compute 84a and 21a².\n\nFirst, a = 0.00977\n\nCompute 84a = 84 * 0.00977 ≈ Let's compute 80*0.00977 = 0.7816, 4*0.00977=0.03908; total ≈ 0.7816 + 0.03908 ≈ 0.82068\n\nThen 21a² = 21*(0.00977)^2. First compute (0.00977)^2 ≈ 0.00009545. Then multiply by 21: ≈ 0.00009545 * 21 ≈ 0.00200445\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation is:\n\n83x² - 0.82068x + 0.00200445 = 0\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n83x² - 0.82068x + 0.00200445 = 0\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [0.82068 ± sqrt( (0.82068)^2 - 4*83*0.00200445 )]/(2*83)\n\nFirst compute discriminant D:\n\nD = (0.82068)^2 - 4*83*0.00200445\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(0.82068)^2 ≈ 0.6735 (approximating; let me compute 0.82^2 = 0.6724, 0.82068^2 ≈ 0.6735)\n\nNow compute 4*83*0.00200445:\n\nFirst compute 4*83 = 332\n\nThen 332 * 0.00200445 ≈ Let me compute 332 * 0.002 = 0.664, and 332 * 0.00000445 ≈ 0.0014764. So total ≈ 0.664 + 0.0014764 ≈ 0.6654764\n\nTherefore, D ≈ 0.6735 - 0.6655 ≈ 0.008\n\nSo sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.008) ≈ 0.08944\n\nTherefore, x ≈ [0.82068 ± 0.08944]/166\n\nBecause 2*83 = 166\n\nSo two solutions:\n\nx1 ≈ [0.82068 + 0.08944]/166 ≈ 0.91012 / 166 ≈ 0.00548 M\n\nx2 ≈ [0.82068 - 0.08944]/166 ≈ 0.73124 / 166 ≈ 0.004399 M ≈ 0.00440 M\n\nNow, as before, check which solution is valid. For x1 ≈ 0.00548 M:\n\n[HI] = 0.00977 - 2*0.00548 ≈ 0.00977 - 0.01096 ≈ -0.00119 M. Negative concentration, invalid. Therefore, reject x1. The valid solution is x2 ≈ 0.00440 M. Therefore, the exact solution via quadratic gives x ≈ 0.00440 M, which matches our previous approximation. Therefore, the concentration of I₂ is x ≈ 0.00440 M, which is 4.4 × 10^-3 M, corresponding to option C.\n\nBut let me verify with the exact numbers. Let me compute the exact discriminant with more precision.\n\nEarlier, I approximated D ≈ 0.008, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute (0.82068)^2:\n\nLet me compute 0.82068 * 0.82068:\n\nFirst, 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64\n\n0.8 * 0.02068 = 0.016544\n\n0.02068 * 0.8 = 0.016544\n\n0.02068 * 0.02068 ≈ 0.0004277\n\nAdding up all terms:\n\nWait, perhaps better to do (a + b)^2 where a = 0.82, b = 0.00068\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me use a calculator-like approach.\n\nLet me write 0.82068 as 0.82068\n\nMultiply 0.82068 by 0.82068:\n\nFirst, 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64\n\n0.8 * 0.02068 = 0.016544\n\n0.02068 * 0.8 = 0.016544\n\n0.02068 * 0.02068 ≈ 0.0004277\n\nAdding all cross terms:\n\nBut actually, the exact way is:\n\n(0.82068)^2 = ?\n\nLet me compute 820.68 * 820.68 × 10^-6\n\nBut this is too tedious. Alternatively, since my approximate value was 0.6735, and the second term was 0.6655, leading to D ≈ 0.008. However, let me check with more precise numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let me use decimal approximations:\n\nLet me take a = 0.82068\n\nCompute a²:\n\na² = (0.8 + 0.02068)^2 = 0.8² + 2*0.8*0.02068 + (0.02068)^2 = 0.64 + 0.033088 + 0.0004277 ≈ 0.64 + 0.033088 = 0.673088 + 0.0004277 ≈ 0.6735157\n\nSo, approximately 0.6735\n\nThen, compute 4*83*0.00200445:\n\nEarlier, I approximated this as 0.6655, but let's calculate it more accurately.\n\nFirst, 4 * 83 = 332\n\nThen 332 * 0.00200445\n\nLet me compute 332 * 0.002 = 0.664\n\nThen 332 * 0.00000445 = ?\n\n0.00000445 * 332 = 0.0014762\n\nTherefore, total is 0.664 + 0.0014762 ≈ 0.6654762\n\nTherefore, D = 0.6735157 - 0.6654762 ≈ 0.0080395\n\nSo sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.0080395) ≈ 0.08966 (since sqrt(0.0081) is 0.09, so slightly less)\n\nTherefore, sqrt(D) ≈ 0.08966\n\nThus, x ≈ [0.82068 ± 0.08966]/166\n\nCalculating x2:\n\n[0.82068 - 0.08966]/166 ≈ (0.73102)/166 ≈ 0.004397 M ≈ 0.00440 M\n\nTherefore, x ≈ 0.00440 M. Therefore, the exact solution gives x ≈ 0.00440 M. Therefore, the concentration of I₂ is 0.00440 M, which is 4.4 × 10^-3 M, which is option C. \n\nBut let me check with the exact value of x in the original Kc expression to see if it gives 21.\n\nCompute [HI] = 0.00977 - 2x = 0.00977 - 2*(0.00440) = 0.00977 - 0.00880 = 0.00097 M.\n\nThen, Kc = [H2][I2]/[HI]^2 = (x)(x)/(0.00097)^2 = (0.0044)^2 / (0.00097)^2 ≈ (0.00001936) / (0.0000009409) ≈ 20.58. Hmm, which is approximately 21, but not exactly. The discrepancy arises because we used approximate values for a (which was 0.00977) and other terms. Let me check if my initial calculation of [HI] initial is precise.\n\nEarlier, I calculated the initial moles of HI as 15 g / 127.908 g/mol ≈ 0.1172 mol. Let me recalculate that more accurately.\n\nMolar mass of HI: H is 1.008 g/mol, I is 126.90 g/mol. Total molar mass = 1.008 + 126.90 = 127.908 g/mol. Correct.\n\n15 g / 127.908 g/mol = ?\n\nLet me perform this division more accurately. Let me write it as:\n\nDivide 15 by 127.908.\n\nLet me note that 127.908 × 0.117 = ?\n\nCalculate 127.908 × 0.1 = 12.7908\n\n127.908 × 0.01 = 1.27908\n\n127.908 × 0.007 = 0.895356\n\nAdding those: 12.7908 + 1.27908 = 14.06988 + 0.895356 = 14.965236 g\n\nSo 0.117 mol corresponds to 14.9652 g. The actual mass is 15.0000 g. The difference is 15.0000 - 14.9652 = 0.0348 g.\n\nSo, how much more is that? Let me compute how many moles 0.0348 g is.\n\n0.0348 g / 127.908 g/mol ≈ 0.000272 mol.\n\nTherefore, total moles is 0.117 + 0.000272 ≈ 0.117272 mol.\n\nTherefore, initial concentration is 0.117272 mol / 12.0 L ≈ 0.0097727 mol/L ≈ 0.009773 M. Previously, I used 0.00977 M, so more accurately it's 0.009773 M. Let me use this more precise value in calculations.\n\nSo, a = 0.009773 M.\n\nLet me redo the quadratic equation with a = 0.009773.\n\nCompute 84a = 84 * 0.009773 ≈ Let's calculate:\n\nFirst, 80 * 0.009773 = 0.78184\n\n4 * 0.009773 = 0.039092\n\nTotal: 0.78184 + 0.039092 = 0.820932\n\nThen, 21a² = 21*(0.009773)^2\n\nFirst compute (0.009773)^2:\n\n0.009773 * 0.009773 ≈ Let me compute 0.009773^2:\n\n≈ (0.01 - 0.000227)^2 ≈ 0.0001 - 2*0.01*0.000227 + (0.000227)^2 ≈ 0.0001 - 0.00000454 + 0.0000000515 ≈ 0.000095456. So approximately 0.00009546.\n\nMultiply by 21: 0.00009546 * 21 ≈ 0.00200466\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation is:\n\n83x² - 0.820932x + 0.00200466 = 0\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = (0.820932)^2 - 4*83*0.00200466\n\nFirst, compute (0.820932)^2:\n\nLet me approximate this. Earlier, with a = 0.009773, we had 0.820932. Let me square this:\n\n0.820932^2 ≈ Let's use the earlier method:\n\nApproximate as (0.82 + 0.000932)^2 ≈ 0.82² + 2*0.82*0.000932 + (0.000932)^2 ≈ 0.6724 + 0.001524 + 0.000000868 ≈ 0.6739248\n\nSo approx 0.6739\n\nThen compute 4*83*0.00200466 = 332 * 0.00200466 ≈ Let me calculate:\n\nAs before, 332 * 0.002 = 0.664\n\nThen 332 * 0.00000466 ≈ 332 * 4.66 × 10^-6 ≈ 1.546 × 10^-3 ≈ 0.001546\n\nTotal ≈ 0.664 + 0.001546 ≈ 0.665546\n\nThus, D ≈ 0.6739 - 0.665546 ≈ 0.008354\n\nsqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.008354) ≈ 0.0914\n\nTherefore, x ≈ [0.820932 ± 0.0914]/(2*83) = [0.820932 ± 0.0914]/166\n\nCalculating the valid solution:\n\nx = [0.820932 - 0.0914]/166 ≈ (0.729532)/166 ≈ 0.004394 M\n\nSo x ≈ 0.004394 M. Let's use this value to compute Kc:\n\n[HI] = 0.009773 - 2x = 0.009773 - 2*(0.004394) = 0.009773 - 0.008788 = 0.000985 M\n\nThen Kc = (x^2)/([HI]^2) = (0.004394)^2 / (0.000985)^2 ≈ (0.00001931) / (0.0000009702) ≈ 19.9. Wait, that's approximately 19.9, which is close to 20, but not 21. Hmm, there's still a discrepancy. Why is that?\n\nAh, perhaps my approximation in calculating D was still rough. Let me try to calculate D more accurately.\n\nLet me compute D = (0.820932)^2 - 4*83*0.00200466\n\nFirst, calculate (0.820932)^2 more accurately.\n\nLet me use the exact value:\n\n0.820932 * 0.820932\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.820932 × 0.820932:\n\nBreak it into (0.8 + 0.020932) × (0.8 + 0.020932)\n\nUsing (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² where a = 0.8, b = 0.020932\n\n= 0.64 + 2*(0.8*0.020932) + (0.020932)^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.8 * 0.020932 = 0.0167456\n\nMultiply by 2: 0.0334912\n\n(0.020932)^2 ≈ 0.000438 (since 0.02^2 = 0.0004, and 0.000932^2 is negligible)\n\nSo total ≈ 0.64 + 0.0334912 + 0.000438 ≈ 0.6739292\n\nSo D ≈ 0.6739292 - 0.665546 ≈ 0.0083832\n\nThus, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.0083832). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nWe know that sqrt(0.0081) = 0.09, sqrt(0.0083832) is slightly higher. Let me compute:\n\nLet me take x = 0.0915\n\n0.0915^2 = 0.00837225, which is very close to 0.0083832. The difference is 0.0083832 - 0.00837225 = 0.00001095. So approximate sqrt(D) ≈ 0.0915 + (0.00001095)/(2*0.0915) ≈ 0.0915 + 0.0000598 ≈ 0.0915598 ≈ 0.09156\n\nTherefore, sqrt(D) ≈ 0.09156\n\nThus, x = [0.820932 - 0.09156]/166 ≈ (0.729372)/166 ≈ 0.004393 M\n\nSo, x ≈ 0.004393 M\n\nNow compute [HI] = 0.009773 - 2x = 0.009773 - 2*0.004393 = 0.009773 - 0.008786 = 0.000987 M\n\nNow compute Kc:\n\nKc = x² / ([HI]^2) = (0.004393)^2 / (0.000987)^2\n\nCalculate numerator: 0.004393² ≈ 0.00001930 (since 0.0044² = 0.00001936)\n\nDenominator: 0.000987² ≈ 0.000000974 (since 0.001² = 0.000001, and 0.000987 is slightly less)\n\nLet me compute denominator more accurately:\n\n0.000987 * 0.000987:\n\nFirst compute 987 * 987, then adjust the decimal.\n\nBut perhaps better to approximate:\n\n(0.000987)^2 = (0.001 - 0.000013)^2 ≈ 0.000001 - 2*0.001*0.000013 + (0.000013)^2 ≈ 0.000001 - 0.000000026 + 0.000000000169 ≈ approximately 0.000000974\n\nTherefore, Kc ≈ 0.00001930 / 0.000000974 ≈ 19.8. Still around 19.8, which is less than 21. There's still a discrepancy here. What's going on?\n\nAh, I think the problem is that my initial calculation of the initial concentration of HI was approximate. Let me recalculate the exact initial concentration.\n\nOriginal problem: 15 grams of HI in 12.0 L flask.\n\nMolar mass of HI is 1.008 + 126.90 = 127.908 g/mol.\n\nExact moles of HI: 15 / 127.908 = ?\n\nLet me perform this division more accurately.\n\nLet me write 15 / 127.908:\n\nLet me note that 127.908 × 0.117 = 14.965236 g as before.\n\nThe difference is 15 - 14.965236 = 0.034764 g.\n\nTo find how much more moles this is:\n\n0.034764 g / 127.908 g/mol ≈ 0.034764 / 127.908 ≈ Let me compute this:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 0.00034764 / 1.27908 ≈ approx 0.0002717 mol.\n\nTherefore, total moles = 0.117 + 0.0002717 ≈ 0.1172717 mol.\n\nInitial concentration [HI] = 0.1172717 mol / 12.0 L ≈ 0.00977264 mol/L ≈ 0.0097726 M\n\nSo, a = 0.0097726 M\n\nLet me now redo the quadratic equation with this precise a.\n\nThe quadratic equation was:\n\n83x² - 84a x + 21a² = 0\n\nWith a = 0.0097726\n\nCompute 84a = 84 * 0.0097726 ≈ 0.8209064\n\nCompute 21a² = 21*(0.0097726)^2\n\nFirst compute a²: (0.0097726)^2 ≈ 0.000095504\n\nMultiply by 21: 0.000095504 * 21 ≈ 0.00200558\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation is:\n\n83x² - 0.8209064x + 0.00200558 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = (0.8209064)^2 - 4*83*0.00200558\n\nFirst compute (0.8209064)^2:\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps. Let's approximate it as follows:\n\nLet me take 0.8209064^2. Let me use the earlier method.\n\nLet me write it as (0.8 + 0.0209064)^2 = 0.64 + 2*0.8*0.0209064 + (0.0209064)^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*0.8*0.0209064 = 1.6 * 0.0209064 ≈ 0.0334502\n\n(0.0209064)^2 ≈ 0.00043697\n\nTotal ≈ 0.64 + 0.0334502 + 0.00043697 ≈ 0.67388717\n\nThen compute 4*83*0.00200558 = 332 * 0.00200558 ≈ Let's calculate:\n\n332 * 0.002 = 0.664\n\n332 * 0.00000558 ≈ 332 * 5.58 × 10^-6 ≈ 1.851 × 10^-3 ≈ 0.001851\n\nTotal ≈ 0.664 + 0.001851 ≈ 0.665851\n\nTherefore, D = 0.67388717 - 0.665851 ≈ 0.008036\n\nsqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.008036) ≈ 0.08964 (since 0.09^2 = 0.0081, so sqrt(0.008036) ≈ 0.09 - (0.0081 - 0.008036)/(2*0.09)) ≈ 0.09 - 0.000064 / 0.18 ≈ 0.09 - 0.000355 ≈ 0.089645\n\nThus, x = [0.8209064 - 0.089645]/(2*83) = [0.8209064 - 0.089645]/166 ≈ 0.7312614 / 166 ≈ 0.004399 M\n\nSo x ≈ 0.004399 M\n\nNow compute [HI] = a - 2x = 0.0097726 - 2*0.004399 ≈ 0.0097726 - 0.008798 ≈ 0.0009746 M\n\nNow compute Kc = x² / ([HI]^2) = (0.004399)^2 / (0.0009746)^2\n\nCalculate numerator: 0.004399² ≈ 0.00001935\n\nDenominator: 0.0009746² ≈ 0.000000950\n\nTherefore, Kc ≈ 0.00001935 / 0.000000950 ≈ 20.37. Still around 20.37, which is close to 21, but not exact. The discrepancy is likely due to rounding errors in the manual calculations. Given that the problem provides Kc as 21, and our calculation gives approximately 20.37 with the precise x, there might be an error in my calculations or perhaps the initial approximation is sufficient for the answer choices given.\n\nHowever, the answer choices are:\n\nA:4.58 mol/L (way too high)\n\nB:0.00687 mol L-1 (0.00687 M)\n\nC:4.4 × 10^-3 M (0.0044 M)\n\nD:9.76 × 10^-3 M (0.00976 M)\n\nOur calculation gives approximately 0.0044 M, which is option C. The slight discrepancy in the Kc value (20.37 vs 21) is likely due to rounding during manual calculations, but since option C is very close to our result, it must be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the setup. Let me double-check the setup.\n\nThe balanced equation is 2 HI ⇌ H₂ + I₂. The Kc is [H2][I2]/[HI]^2 = 21. Correct.\n\nInitial moles of HI: 15 g / 127.908 g/mol ≈ 0.1173 mol. Initial concentration: 0.1173 / 12.0 ≈ 0.00977 M. Correct.\n\nICE table: [HI] = 0.00977 - 2x, [H2] = x, [I2] = x. Correct.\n\nEquation: x² / (0.00977 - 2x)^2 = 21. Correct.\n\nSolving gives x ≈ 0.0044 M. Correct.\n\nTherefore, despite the slight discrepancy in Kc due to rounding, the answer is C: 4.4 × 10^-3 M.\n\nAnother possibility is that I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me confirm:\n\nThe balanced equation is 2 HI → H₂ + I₂. Yes, so 2 moles of HI produce 1 mole each of H₂ and I₂. Therefore, the ICE table is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to assume that x is very small compared to the initial concentration, so that 0.00977 - 2x ≈ 0.00977. Let's try that approximation to see what happens.\n\nIf we assume that 0.00977 - 2x ≈ 0.00977, then the equation becomes:\n\nx² / (0.00977)^2 = 21 → x = sqrt(21) * 0.00977 ≈ 4.5837 * 0.00977 ≈ 0.04478 M\n\nBut this would give [I2] = 0.04478 M, which is way higher than the answer choices. But this is impossible because 2x would be 0.08956 M, which is greater than the initial concentration of HI (0.00977 M), leading to negative concentrations. Therefore, this approximation is invalid, and we must solve the quadratic equation, which we did, leading to x ≈ 0.0044 M.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
