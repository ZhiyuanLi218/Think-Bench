The total mass of the sample is 29.05 grams. They told me that the mass of carbon is 18.02 grams and the mass of hydrogen is 3.03 grams. Hmm, so first I guess I need to figure out the mass of oxygen in the sample. Since the total mass is 29.05 grams, I can subtract the masses of carbon and hydrogen to get the oxygen mass.\n\nLet me write that down. Total mass is 29.05 g. Carbon is 18.02 g, hydrogen is 3.03 g. So oxygen mass would be 29.05 - 18.02 - 3.03. Let me calculate that. 29.05 minus 18.02 is 11.03, and then subtract 3.03 gives me 11.03 - 3.03 = 8.00 grams of oxygen. Okay, so the masses are C: 18.02 g, H: 3.03 g, O: 8.00 g.\n\nNow, to find the empirical formula, I need to convert these masses to moles. For that, I need the molar masses of each element. Carbon's molar mass is 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. Let me check those numbers again to make sure I have them right. Yeah, Carbon is approximately 12.01, Hydrogen is about 1.008, and Oxygen is 16.00 g/mol.\n\nStarting with carbon: 18.02 g divided by 12.01 g/mol. Let me compute that. Let me do 18.02 / 12.01. Hmm, 12.01 times 1.5 is 18.015, which is almost 18.02. So that's approximately 1.5 moles of carbon. Let me write that as 1.50 moles. \n\nNext, hydrogen: 3.03 g divided by 1.008 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 3.03 divided by 1.008. Let me approximate. 1.008 times 3 is 3.024, so 3.03 is a bit more than 3 moles. Let me do the exact calculation: 3.03 / 1.008. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 1.008. Let me use a calculator here. 3.03 divided by 1.008. Let me see, 1.008 * 3 = 3.024, so 3.03 - 3.024 = 0.006. So 0.006 / 1.008 is approximately 0.006 / 1.008 ≈ 0.00595. So total moles of H is 3 + 0.00595 ≈ 3.00595 moles. Let me round that to 3.01 moles. So approximately 3.01 moles of hydrogen.\n\nThen oxygen: 8.00 grams divided by 16.00 g/mol. That's straightforward. 8.00 / 16.00 = 0.5 moles of oxygen. \n\nSo now I have the moles of each element: C = 1.50 mol, H = 3.01 mol, O = 0.50 mol. \n\nThe next step is to find the simplest whole number ratio of these moles. To do that, I can divide each number of moles by the smallest number of moles among them. The smallest is 0.50 mol (oxygen). \n\nSo dividing each by 0.50:\n\nCarbon: 1.50 / 0.50 = 3\n\nHydrogen: 3.01 / 0.50 ≈ 6.02\n\nOxygen: 0.50 / 0.50 = 1\n\nSo the ratio is approximately C3H6O1. So the empirical formula would be C3H6O. \n\nLooking at the options given: A is C2H4O, B is C3H6O, C is C2H6O3, D is C3H8O2. So option B is C3H6O, which matches the ratio I found. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify the moles again. \n\nCarbon: 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol. Let me do exact division. 18.02 divided by 12.01. Let me see, 12.01 * 1.5 = 18.015, which is very close to 18.02. So 1.50 moles is correct. \n\nHydrogen: 3.03 g / 1.008 g/mol. Let me compute 3.03 / 1.008. Let me write 3.03 divided by 1.008. Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 3030 / 1008. Let me divide both by 6: 505 / 168. Let me compute that. 168 * 3 = 504. So 505 / 168 ≈ 3.00595, which is approximately 3.01. So that's correct.\n\nOxygen: 8.00 / 16.00 = 0.50. Correct.\n\nDividing by the smallest (0.50):\n\nC: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3\n\nH: 3.01 / 0.5 ≈ 6.02 ≈ 6\n\nO: 1. \n\nSo the ratio is 3:6:1. Therefore, the empirical formula is C3H6O. Which is option B. \n\nBut let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation steps. For example, did I correctly calculate the oxygen mass? Total mass is 29.05. Carbon is 18.02, hydrogen is 3.03. So 18.02 + 3.03 = 21.05. Then 29.05 - 21.05 = 8.00 g of O. Correct. \n\nYes, so the oxygen mass is correct. Then the moles are correct. Then dividing by 0.5 gives 3:6:1. \n\nSo the empirical formula is C3H6O. Which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes when ratios are not whole numbers, you have to multiply by a factor to get whole numbers. But in this case, after dividing by the smallest, we get whole numbers (3, 6, 1). So that's already the simplest ratio. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: C3H6O.\n</think>"}
