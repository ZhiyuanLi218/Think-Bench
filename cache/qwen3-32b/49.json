The charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, each with a magnitude of 4.0 nC, and they're separated by 2.0 cm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that an electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges. The electric field at a point due to a dipole depends on the position relative to the dipole. In this case, the point of interest is exactly midway between the two charges. Let me visualize this: one positive charge on the left, a negative charge on the right, and the midpoint is right in the middle.\n\nSince electric fields are vectors, I need to consider the direction of each field contribution from the two charges. The electric field due to a positive charge points away from it, and the electric field due to a negative charge points toward it. So, at the midpoint between the dipole, the electric field from the positive charge would be directed to the right (away from the positive charge), and the electric field from the negative charge would also be directed to the right (toward the negative charge). Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me double-check. If I'm at the midpoint between a positive and a negative charge, then the positive charge's electric field at that point would be pointing away from the positive charge, which would be towards the negative charge. Similarly, the negative charge's electric field at the midpoint would be pointing towards itself, which is also towards the negative charge. So both electric fields are pointing in the same direction, towards the negative charge? Wait, no. If the positive is on the left and the negative on the right, then the electric field from the positive charge at the midpoint is to the right (away from positive), and the electric field from the negative charge at the midpoint is also to the right (towards negative). So both fields are in the same direction. Therefore, they should add up. But wait, that seems like they would add up, but I thought in a dipole the fields might cancel. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the dipole field at points along the axis versus perpendicular?\n\nWait, no. In a dipole, the electric field at points along the axis of the dipole (which is the case here, since the midpoint is along the axis connecting the two charges) actually has a specific formula. But maybe I should just compute the fields from each charge and add them as vectors.\n\nLet me recall the formula for electric field due to a point charge: E = k * |q| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²), q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge to the point where we're calculating the field.\n\nSince the charges are 2.0 cm apart, the midpoint is 1.0 cm from each charge. So, the distance r for each charge to the midpoint is 0.01 meters.\n\nSo, let me compute the electric field from each charge at the midpoint.\n\nFirst, the positive charge: E1 = k * q / r². Since it's positive, direction is away from it, which is towards the negative charge (to the right if positive is on the left).\n\nSecond, the negative charge: E2 = k * |q| / r². Since it's negative, the direction is towards it, which is also towards the negative charge (to the right if negative is on the right). Therefore, both E1 and E2 are in the same direction. Therefore, the total electric field is E1 + E2.\n\nWait, so both fields are adding up? That would mean the total electric field is twice the field from one charge. But that seems counterintuitive because in some dipole configurations, the fields cancel. But here, because the point is along the axis between the charges, and each field is in the same direction, they add. Let me confirm with numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\nq = 4.0 nC = 4.0 × 10^-9 C\n\nr = 1.0 cm = 0.01 m\n\nk = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²\n\nCompute E1 and E2:\n\nE1 = k * q / r² = (8.99e9) * (4.0e-9) / (0.01)^2\n\nSimilarly for E2, since it's the same magnitude.\n\nSo total E = E1 + E2 = 2 * [ (8.99e9) * (4.0e-9) / (0.01)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute numerator: 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9 = let's see:\n\n8.99 × 4.0 = 35.96, and then 1e9 * 1e-9 = 1. So 35.96 × 1 = 35.96 N·m²/C * C / m²? Wait, units would be N/C, since E is in N/C.\n\nThen divide by (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 m².\n\nSo 35.96 / 0.0001 = 35.96 / 1e-4 = 35.96 × 1e4 = 35.96 × 10^4 N/C.\n\nMultiply by 2 for both charges: 2 × 35.96 × 10^4 = 71.92 × 10^4 N/C ≈ 7.2 × 10^5 N/C.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 7.2 × 10^5 V/m. Since 1 V/m = 1 N/C, so that would be option D. But wait, the answer options include 0, 9e4, 1.8e5, 7.2e5. So according to my calculation, it's D. But let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, but I thought in a dipole, the electric field at the center is zero? Wait, no. Wait, if you have two equal and opposite charges, then the electric field at the midpoint would not be zero because the fields from each charge are in the same direction. Wait, let me think again. If you have two charges, +q and -q separated by distance d. At the midpoint, the electric field due to +q is towards the -q (since it's positive, field goes away from it), and the electric field due to -q is towards itself (so same direction). Therefore, both fields add up. Therefore, total E is 2*(kq/(d/2)^2). Which would be 2*(kq/( (d²)/4 )) = 8kq/d². Wait, but in this case, the separation between the charges is 2.0 cm, so d = 0.02 m. But the distance from each charge to the midpoint is d/2 = 0.01 m. So my calculation was correct.\n\nBut maybe there's a standard formula for the electric field of a dipole. Let me recall. The electric field of a dipole along its axis is given by E = (1/(4πε0)) * (2p)/r³, where p is the dipole moment, and r is the distance from the center of the dipole. Wait, but that formula is for points far away from the dipole, right? When r is much larger than the separation between the charges. In this case, we're at the midpoint, so r is actually equal to d/2. So that formula might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, let's derive it. For a dipole, p = q*d. The electric field along the axis at a distance r from the center would be E = [k*(q)/(r - d/2)^2] - [k*(q)/(r + d/2)^2]. Wait, but when r is much larger than d, we can approximate. But here, r is d/2. Let me plug in r = d/2. Wait, if the point is at the center, then r = 0? No, if the dipole is of length d, and we are at the midpoint between the charges, then the distance from the center of the dipole to the point is zero. Wait, but the formula I mentioned earlier is for points along the axis at distance r from the center. But here, the point is at the center. So if we take r approaching zero, but in reality, the charges are separated by d. So maybe that formula isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, let's just stick with calculating each field. So each charge contributes E = kq/r², with both in the same direction. Therefore, total E is 2*kq/r². Given that r is 0.01 m, and q is 4.0e-9 C.\n\nSo plugging in numbers:\n\nk = 8.99e9 N·m²/C²\n\nq = 4.0e-9 C\n\nr = 0.01 m\n\nE_total = 2 * (8.99e9 * 4.0e-9) / (0.01)^2\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9 = 8.99 * 4.0 * 1e0 = 35.96 N·m/C ?\n\nWait, units: k has units N·m²/C², multiplied by q (C) gives N·m²/C. Divided by r² (m²) gives N/C. Correct.\n\nSo 35.96 divided by 0.0001 (which is (0.01)^2) is 35.96 / 0.0001 = 35.96 / 1e-4 = 35.96 * 1e4 = 359600 N/C.\n\nMultiply by 2 gives 719200 N/C ≈ 7.2 × 10^5 N/C, which is option D. So according to this, the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because I thought in some cases the field at the center cancels. Wait, no, only if the charges are same sign? But here they are opposite. For example, if you have two positive charges, then at the midpoint the fields would be in opposite directions and cancel. But since they are opposite charges, the fields add.\n\nLet me think of another way. Imagine replacing the dipole with two positive charges. Then at the midpoint, the fields would be equal and opposite, so net zero. Similarly, if two negative charges, same thing. But with opposite charges, the fields are in same direction. So yes, in that case, adding. So my calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with numbers again. Let me compute 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9 first.\n\n8.99 × 4.0 = 35.96, so 35.96 × 1e0 = 35.96. Then divide by (0.01)^2 = 0.0001. 35.96 / 0.0001 = 35.96 / 1e-4 = 35.96 × 1e4 = 35.96 × 10^4 = 3.596 × 10^5. Multiply by 2 gives 7.192 × 10^5 ≈ 7.2 × 10^5 V/m. So that's option D.\n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in the direction. Suppose the positive charge is on the left, negative on the right. At the midpoint, electric field from positive is to the right, electric field from negative is also to the right. So total is sum. So correct. Therefore, answer D. But let me check the options again. The options are A: 0, B: 9.0 × 10^4, C: 1.8 × 10^5, D: 7.2 × 10^5. So D is the answer. But why is option C present? Let me check if I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of r? Wait, the separation between the charges is 2.0 cm, so the distance from each charge to the midpoint is 1.0 cm, which is 0.01 m. Correct. So r is 0.01 m. So r squared is 0.0001 m². Correct. So calculation is correct. So 7.2 × 10^5 V/m is the answer. So D.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem. For example, if someone thought that the fields cancel, they would choose A. But that would be wrong. If someone thought that each field is kq/r² and forgot to multiply by 2, they might get 3.6 × 10^5, which isn't an option. But if they made a mistake in the distance? Let's see. Suppose someone thought that the distance is 2.0 cm instead of 1.0 cm. Let's see what that would give.\n\nIf r was 0.02 m instead of 0.01 m:\n\nE = 2 * [ (8.99e9)(4.0e-9) / (0.02)^2 ] = 2 * [ 35.96 / 0.0004 ] = 2 * [ 35.96 / 4e-4 ] = 2 * 89900 ≈ 1.8 × 10^5 V/m, which is option C. So if someone used the full separation instead of half, they would get option C. So maybe that's a common mistake.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the fields cancel, they would get zero (option A). But according to the correct calculation, it's D. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check with exact numbers. Let me compute the exact value.\n\nk = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²\n\nq = 4.0 × 10^-9 C\n\nr = 0.01 m\n\nE from one charge: E = (8.99e9) * (4.0e-9) / (0.01)^2\n\nFirst compute 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9:\n\nMultiply 8.99 * 4.0 = 35.96\n\nMultiply by 1e9 * 1e-9 = 1e0 = 1. So total is 35.96 N·m²/C * 1 / m² = 35.96 N/C? Wait no:\n\nWait, E = kq / r². The units are (N·m²/C² * C) / m² = N/C. Correct. So 35.96 N/C divided by (0.01 m)^2?\n\nWait no, 8.99e9 * 4.0e-9 is 35.96, and then divided by (0.01)^2 = 0.0001. So 35.96 / 0.0001 = 35.96 / 1e-4 = 35.96 × 1e4 = 359600 N/C. Then multiplied by 2 is 719200 N/C ≈ 7.19 × 10^5 N/C. Which is 7.2 × 10^5 V/m (since 1 V/m = 1 N/C). So yes, that's option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut let me check once more with another approach. Let's use the formula for electric field of a dipole at a point along its axis. Wait, but the standard formula is for points far from the dipole. However, let's try to use it here and see if it gives the same result or not. The dipole moment p = q * d, where d is the separation between charges. Here, d = 0.02 m. So p = 4.0e-9 C * 0.02 m = 8.0e-11 C·m.\n\nThe formula for electric field along the axis of the dipole at a distance r from the center is E = (1/(4πε0)) * (2p)/r³. However, in this case, r is the distance from the center of the dipole to the point where we are calculating the field. In our problem, the point is at the center of the dipole, so r = 0. If we plug r = 0 into this formula, it would give an undefined (infinite) value, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, this formula is not applicable at r = 0. Hence, we must calculate the fields from each charge individually, which we did earlier, leading us to answer D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: 7.2 × 10^5 V/m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
