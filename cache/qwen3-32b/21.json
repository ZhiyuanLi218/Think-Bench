Let me start by recalling what the ion-electron method is used for. From what I remember, it's mainly for redox reactions where there are changes in oxidation states of elements. So the first step is to check each reaction to see if any of them involve oxidation or reduction processes.\n\nLooking at option A: BaCl2 + Al2(SO4)3 → AlCl3 + BaSO4. Let me break down the compounds. Barium chloride reacting with aluminum sulfate to produce aluminum chloride and barium sulfate. I should check the oxidation states here. Barium is +2 in BaCl2, aluminum is +3 in Al2(SO4)3, sulfur in sulfate is +6, oxygen is -2. On the product side, in AlCl3, aluminum is +3 and chlorine is -1. In BaSO4, barium is +2, sulfur is +6, oxygen -2. So looking at the elements, there's no change in oxidation states. Barium stays +2, aluminum stays +3, sulfur stays +6. Chlorine is -1 on both sides. So this seems like a double displacement reaction without any redox happening. So probably doesn't need the ion-electron method.\n\nOption B: H+ + OH- → H2O. That's a simple acid-base neutralization. Hydrogen is +1 in H+ and in H2O, oxygen is -2 in OH- and in H2O. No change in oxidation states. So again, no redox here. Doesn't need the ion-electron method.\n\nOption C: NaOH + H3PO4 → Na2HPO4 + H2O. Let me check the oxidation states. Sodium is +1 in NaOH and Na2HPO4. Oxygen is -2 in all compounds. Phosphorus in H3PO4: let's calculate. H is +1, O is -2. So 3(+1) + P + 4(-2) = 0 → 3 + P -8 = 0 → P = +5. In Na2HPO4, the phosphate part is HPO4^2-. So H is +1, P is ?, O is -2. So +1 + P + 4(-2) = -2 → 1 + P -8 = -2 → P -7 = -2 → P = +5. So phosphorus remains +5. Sodium is +1, hydrogen is +1 or in water it's +1. No changes in oxidation states. So this is an acid-base reaction where H3PO4 is reacting with NaOH to form a sodium phosphate and water. No redox involved here either. So probably not needing ion-electron method.\n\nOption D: C2H2(g) + N2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(g) + N2(g). Let's check oxidation states here. Acetylene (C2H2): Carbon in C2H2. Each H is +1, so total for H is +2. Since the molecule is neutral, 2C + 2(+1) = 0 → 2C = -2 → C = -1 each. In CO2, carbon is +4 (since O is -2 each, so C + 2(-2) = 0 → C = +4). So carbon is going from -1 to +4, which is oxidation. \n\nNow for nitrogen in N2O. Let's calculate oxidation state. Let’s assume N is x. 2x + (-2) = 0 (since N2O is neutral). So 2x = +2 → x = +1. In N2, nitrogen is 0. So nitrogen goes from +1 to 0, which is reduction. \n\nHydrogen in C2H2 is +1, in H2O it's +1, so no change. Oxygen in N2O is -2, in CO2 it's -2, in H2O it's -2. So the only changes are in carbon and nitrogen. Carbon is oxidized, nitrogen is reduced. Therefore, this is a redox reaction and would require the ion-electron method to balance the electrons transferred. \n\nSo among the options, D is the one that involves redox and thus needs the ion-electron method. Let me double-check the other options again to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nA: All oxidation states same. B: Same. C: Same. D: Yes, redox. So the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
