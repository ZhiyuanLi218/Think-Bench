I need to find the pH of the mixture after combining 50 mL of 0.0025 M HBr with 50 mL of 0.0023 M KOH. Hmm, HBr is a strong acid, right? And KOH is a strong base. So when they mix, they should neutralize each other. But since they might not be in equal amounts, there might be some excess H+ or OH- left. \n\nFirst, I should figure out how many moles of H+ and OH- are present initially. For HBr, since it's a strong acid, it dissociates completely. The concentration is 0.0025 M, and the volume is 50 mL, which is 0.05 L. Moles of H+ would be Molarity times Volume, so 0.0025 mol/L * 0.05 L = 0.000125 mol H+.\n\nThen for KOH, which is a strong base, it dissociates completely into K+ and OH-. The concentration is 0.0023 M, same volume of 50 mL. So moles of OH- would be 0.0023 * 0.05 = 0.000115 mol OH-.\n\nNow, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio to form water. So the moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. Let me subtract the smaller amount from the larger to find out how much is left. \n\nH+ is 0.000125 mol and OH- is 0.000115 mol. So H+ is in excess by 0.000125 - 0.000115 = 0.00001 mol. \n\nNow, the total volume of the solution is 50 + 50 = 100 mL, which is 0.1 L. So the concentration of the excess H+ ions would be moles over total volume: 0.00001 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0001 M. \n\nWait, 0.0001 M H+ is the same as 1e-4 M. The pH is calculated as -log[H+]. Let me compute that. \n\nLog of 1e-4 is -4, so negative of that is 4. So the pH should be 4. Let me check if I did everything right. \n\nWait, let me verify the moles again. For HBr: 0.0025 M * 0.05 L = 0.000125 mol. Correct. KOH: 0.0023 * 0.05 = 0.000115 mol. Correct. Difference is 0.00001 mol H+ excess. Total volume 0.1 L. So concentration is 0.0001 M. pH is 4. So answer is B:4. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no calculation errors. Let me recalculate the moles. \n\nHBr: 50 mL is 50/1000 = 0.05 L. 0.0025 * 0.05 = 0.000125. Yes. KOH: 0.0023 * 0.05 = 0.000115. Yes. Subtracting gives 0.00001 mol H+ left. Then divided by 0.1 L gives 0.0001 M. pH is -log(1e-4) = 4. So answer B. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people make mistakes with significant figures. Let me check. The concentrations are given to 4 decimal places, but the volumes are exact? The problem states 50.0 mL, so three significant figures. The concentrations are 0.0025 M (two significant figures?) Wait, 0.0025 is two significant figures? The leading zeros are not significant. So 0.0025 is two sig figs. Similarly, 0.0023 is two sig figs. So the moles would be two sig figs each. Let me see:\n\nHBr moles: 0.0025 M * 0.0500 L. Wait, the volume is 50.0 mL, which is three decimal places. So 0.0500 L. So the moles would be 0.0025 * 0.0500 = 0.000125. But 0.0025 has two sig figs, 0.0500 has three. The product should have two sig figs. So 0.000125 is 1.25e-4, but with two sig figs, it would be 1.3e-4? Wait, no. Wait, 0.0025 is two decimal places? Wait, the number is 0.0025. The significant figures are the 2 and 5. So two sig figs. Multiplying by 0.0500 (three sig figs) gives two sig figs. So 0.0025 * 0.0500 = 0.000125. But with two sig figs, that would be 0.00013 mol. Similarly for KOH: 0.0023 * 0.0500 = 0.000115, which with two sig figs is 0.00012 mol. Then the difference would be 0.00013 - 0.00012 = 0.00001 mol. But actually, if we consider the exact numbers, it's 0.000125 - 0.000115 = 0.000010 mol. So with two decimal places? Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the answer is exactly pH 4. Maybe they intended us to ignore significant figures for the answer options. Since the answer choices are integers, and the calculation gives exactly pH 4, then answer B is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the dilution? Let me check again. When you mix two solutions, the total volume is additive. So 50 + 50 = 100 mL. The moles of H+ and OH- are calculated correctly. Then after neutralization, the excess H+ is 0.00001 mol in 0.1 L, so 0.0001 M. pH is 4. So answer B. \n\nYes, I think that's right. So the answer is B:4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
