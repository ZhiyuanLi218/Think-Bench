The options are Rb+, Se²⁻, As⁵+, and Sr²+. Hmm, let me start by recalling what electron configurations are. \n\nFirst, I remember that ions form when atoms gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, usually resembling the nearest noble gas. So, each of these ions should have an electron configuration similar to a noble gas, right? But the question says one of them is different, so I need to check each one individually.\n\nLet me start with Rb+. Rubidium is in group 1, so it has one valence electron. When it loses that electron to become Rb+, it should have the same electron configuration as the noble gas before it. Rubidium's atomic number is 37, so Rb+ would have 36 electrons. The noble gas with 38 electrons? Wait, no, atomic number 36 is Krypton (Kr), right? So Rb+ would have the same configuration as Kr. Let me confirm: Kr has 36 electrons. Rb has 37, so losing one gives 36. Yep, that's Kr's configuration.\n\nNext is Se²⁻. Selenium is in group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons. To gain a full octet, it needs to gain two electrons. Selenium's atomic number is 34. Adding two electrons would give it 36 electrons. So Se²⁻ would also have the same configuration as Kr. That makes sense because Kr is the noble gas in the same period as Se. So Se²⁻ is isoelectronic with Kr. So that's the same as Rb+.\n\nNow As⁵+. Arsenic is in group 15. It has 5 valence electrons. If it loses five electrons, it would have a +5 charge. Arsenic's atomic number is 33. Losing five electrons would give As⁵+ an electron count of 28. Let me check what element has 28 electrons. Iron (Fe) has atomic number 26, so 28 electrons would be Ni²+? Wait, no. Wait, neutral atoms have electrons equal to their atomic number. So if As⁵+ has 33 - 5 = 28 electrons. Let me think about the electron configuration here. Arsenic is in period 4. The noble gas before that is Kr again, but Kr has 36 electrons. So 28 electrons is less than that. Let me write out the configuration for As⁵+.\n\nNeutral As has atomic number 33. Its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p³. When it loses five electrons to become As⁵+, it would lose the outermost electrons first. The outermost are the 4s² and 4p³. So losing 5 electrons would take away 4s² and 4p³, leaving the configuration as [Ar] 3d¹⁰. Wait, but [Ar] is 18 electrons, plus 10 from 3d gives 28 total. So As⁵+ has [Ar]3d¹⁰. Now, what noble gas is that similar to? The noble gases are He (2), Ne (10), Ar (18), Kr (36), Xe (54), etc. So [Ar]3d¹⁰ is not a noble gas configuration. Instead, it's similar to the configuration of Zn²+ or something else? Because Zn has [Ar]3d¹⁰4s², so Zn²+ would be [Ar]3d¹⁰. So As⁵+ has the same configuration as Zn²+. But the other ions (Rb+ and Se²⁻) have Kr configuration. So As⁵+ is different here. Let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nThe last one is Sr²+. Strontium is in group 2, atomic number 38. Losing two electrons gives Sr²+ with 36 electrons. So same as Kr. So Sr²+ is isoelectronic with Kr. Therefore, Rb+, Se²⁻, and Sr²+ all have Kr's electron configuration, but As⁵+ has [Ar]3d¹⁰, which is different. Therefore, the answer should be C: As⁵+.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake with As⁵+? Let me think again. Arsenic's neutral configuration is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p³. When it loses 5 electrons to become +5, which electrons go first? Typically, the highest energy level electrons are lost first. In the case of transition metals and post-transition metals, the 4s electrons are lost before the 3d. But for main group elements like As, it's the 4s and 4p. So losing the 4s² and 4p³ would leave the inner electrons. So yes, [Ar]3d¹⁰. That's correct. And Kr is [Ar]3d¹⁰4s²4p⁶. So As⁵+ is missing the 4s and 4p, so it's not Kr. Therefore, As⁵+ is the odd one out. The others all have Kr configuration. So the answer is C.\n</think>"}
