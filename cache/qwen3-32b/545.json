Let me write that down to visualize it better:\n\nlog₂3 · log₃4 · log₄5 · log₅6 · log₆7 · log₇8.\n\nHmm, that's a chain of logarithms where each subsequent log has a base that's the previous argument. It seems like there might be a pattern or a property that can simplify this product. I remember something about changing the base of logarithms... maybe the change of base formula? Let me recall. The change of base formula says that log_b a = (ln a) / (ln b), right? Or it could be with any base, not just natural logarithm. So maybe if I convert all these logarithms to the same base, something will cancel out?\n\nLet me try applying the change of base formula to each term. Let's pick a common base. Maybe base 2? Or base 10? Or maybe natural logarithm? Let me try natural logarithm first since it's commonly used. Let's convert each term:\n\nlog₂3 = ln3 / ln2,\n\nlog₃4 = ln4 / ln3,\n\nlog₄5 = ln5 / ln4,\n\nlog₅6 = ln6 / ln5,\n\nlog₆7 = ln7 / ln6,\n\nlog₇8 = ln8 / ln7.\n\nSo when I multiply all these together, it becomes:\n\n(ln3 / ln2) * (ln4 / ln3) * (ln5 / ln4) * (ln6 / ln5) * (ln7 / ln6) * (ln8 / ln7).\n\nOh! Look at that! The terms are telescoping. The ln3 in the numerator of the first term cancels with the ln3 in the denominator of the second term. Similarly, ln4 cancels between the second numerator and third denominator, and so on. Let me write that out step by step:\n\nFirst term numerator: ln3\n\nFirst term denominator: ln2\n\nSecond term numerator: ln4\n\nSecond term denominator: ln3\n\nThird term numerator: ln5\n\nThird term denominator: ln4\n\nFourth term numerator: ln6\n\nFourth term denominator: ln5\n\nFifth term numerator: ln7\n\nFifth term denominator: ln6\n\nSixth term numerator: ln8\n\nSixth term denominator: ln7\n\nSo multiplying all together, the denominators are ln2, ln3, ln4, ln5, ln6, ln7 and the numerators are ln3, ln4, ln5, ln6, ln7, ln8. Therefore, everything cancels except the denominator ln2 and the numerator ln8. Therefore, the entire product simplifies to ln8 / ln2.\n\nBut ln8 / ln2 is just log base 2 of 8, right? Because by change of base formula, log_b a = ln a / ln b. Therefore, ln8 / ln2 = log₂8.\n\nAnd 8 is 2³, so log₂8 = 3. Therefore, the entire product is equal to 3. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, let me verify with numbers. Let me compute each log term numerically and multiply them to see if I get 3.\n\nFirst, log₂3 ≈ 1.58496\n\nlog₃4 ≈ 1.26186\n\nlog₄5 ≈ 1.16096\n\nlog₅6 ≈ 1.11328\n\nlog₆7 ≈ 1.08826\n\nlog₇8 ≈ 1.05944\n\nNow multiply them all together step by step:\n\nStart with 1.58496 * 1.26186 ≈ 1.58496 * 1.26186 ≈ let me calculate that. 1.58496 * 1.26186 ≈ approx 2.0 (exact value?)\n\nLet me compute 1.58496 × 1.26186. Let me do 1.58496 × 1.26186:\n\nFirst approximate 1.58496 × 1.26 ≈ 1.58496 × 1.26 ≈ 1.58496 × 1 + 1.58496 × 0.26 ≈ 1.58496 + 0.4120896 ≈ 1.9970496 ≈ 2.0. So approximately 2.0. Then next term is ×1.16096.\n\nSo 2.0 × 1.16096 ≈ 2.32192. Next multiply by log₅6 ≈ 1.11328: 2.32192 × 1.11328 ≈ Let me calculate that. 2.32192 × 1.11 ≈ 2.32192 + 2.32192 × 0.11 ≈ 2.32192 + 0.25541 ≈ 2.57733. Then times 1.11328 is a bit more. Maybe approx 2.577 × 1.113 ≈ let me compute 2.577 × 1.113. Let me do 2.577 × 1 + 2.577 × 0.1 + 2.577 × 0.013 ≈ 2.577 + 0.2577 + 0.0335 ≈ approx 2.577 + 0.2912 ≈ 2.868. Then next multiply by log₆7 ≈ 1.08826. So 2.868 × 1.088 ≈ Let me approximate 2.868 × 1.088. 2.868 × 1 = 2.868, 2.868 × 0.088 ≈ 0.252. So total ≈ 2.868 + 0.252 ≈ 3.12. Then multiply by log₇8 ≈ 1.05944. So 3.12 × 1.059 ≈ approx 3.12 + 3.12 × 0.059 ≈ 3.12 + 0.184 ≈ 3.304. Wait, but according to my earlier conclusion, the answer should be 3. But my numerical calculation is giving me approx 3.3? That's a problem. There must be an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe my approximated values are off? Let me check with more accurate calculations or perhaps my initial conclusion was wrong?\n\nWait, let me recast the problem. Let me check the symbolic calculation again. If I have:\n\nlog₂3 · log₃4 · log₄5 · log₅6 · log₆7 · log₇8.\n\nConvert each term to natural logs:\n\n(ln3/ln2) * (ln4/ln3) * (ln5/ln4) * (ln6/ln5) * (ln7/ln6) * (ln8/ln7) = ln8 / ln2 = log₂8 = 3. Since 8 is 2³. So that seems correct. But when I multiplied the approximate decimal values, I ended up with approximately 3.3. Therefore, there must be an error in my decimal approximations. Let me check the individual log values again.\n\nFirst, log₂3. Let me calculate log₂3. Since 2^1 = 2, 2^1.58496 ≈ 3. Let me recall that log₂3 ≈ 1.58496 is correct. Let me check with calculator steps. Let me use calculator-like computations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use exact fractions? Wait, but maybe my multiplication steps had errors. Let me try again with more accurate decimal approximations.\n\nLet me look up or calculate each logarithm more accurately.\n\nFirst, log₂3:\n\nlog₂3 ≈ 1.5849625007\n\nlog₃4: log base 3 of 4. Let me calculate that. Since 3^1 = 3, 3^1.26186 ≈ 4. Let me compute ln4 / ln3 ≈ 1.386294 / 1.098612 ≈ 1.261859. So that's correct.\n\nlog₄5: ln5 / ln4 ≈ 1.60943791 / 1.386294 ≈ 1.160964.\n\nlog₅6: ln6 / ln5 ≈ 1.791759 / 1.6094379 ≈ 1.11328.\n\nlog₆7: ln7 / ln6 ≈ 1.945910 / 1.791759 ≈ 1.0860.\n\nWait, earlier I had approximated log₆7 as 1.08826. Let me check with calculator. Let me compute ln7 ≈ 1.9459101490553, ln6 ≈ 1.7917594692281. Dividing 1.945910 / 1.791759 ≈ 1.0860. So my previous value of 1.08826 was slightly off. Let me note the exact decimal approx:\n\nlog₆7 ≈ 1.0860.\n\nSimilarly, log₇8: ln8 / ln7 ≈ 2.07944154 / 1.945910 ≈ 1.0686.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was approx 1.05944. Wait, let me check:\n\nln8 is ln(2^3) = 3 ln2 ≈ 3 * 0.693147 ≈ 2.079441.\n\nln7 ≈ 1.945910.\n\nSo 2.079441 / 1.945910 ≈ 1.0686. So my previous value of 1.05944 was wrong. I think I confused it with log base something else. Therefore, my previous multiplication steps had errors in the approximated values. Let me recalculate the product with corrected values.\n\nSo let me list the accurate approximate decimal values:\n\nlog₂3 ≈ 1.5849625\n\nlog₃4 ≈ 1.2618595\n\nlog₄5 ≈ 1.1609640\n\nlog₅6 ≈ 1.1132828\n\nlog₆7 ≈ 1.0860331\n\nlog₇8 ≈ 1.0686033\n\nNow let me multiply them step by step:\n\nStart with 1.5849625 × 1.2618595 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 1.5849625 × 1.2618595.\n\nLet me note that 1.5849625 × 1.2618595 ≈ log₂3 × log₃4 = (ln3/ln2)(ln4/ln3) = ln4 / ln2 = log₂4 = 2. Exactly. Because ln4/ln2 is log₂4, which is 2. So that product is exactly 2. Therefore, my previous approximation was wrong because I was using rounded numbers. Therefore, the first two terms multiply to exactly 2. Then multiplying by the next term:\n\n2 × log₄5 = 2 × 1.160964 ≈ 2.321928.\n\nBut again, let's think symbolically. If I have up to log₄5, that would be log₂4 × log₄5 = (ln4/ln2) × (ln5/ln4) = ln5 / ln2 = log₂5. Wait, so in general, each multiplication continues the telescoping. Therefore, after multiplying all terms, it's log₂8, which is 3. Therefore, if I do the multiplications step by step numerically, I should get 2 after first two terms, then 2 × log₄5 = log₂4 × log₄5 = log₂5 ≈ 2.321928095. Let me check with calculator: log₂5 is ln5 / ln2 ≈ 1.60944 / 0.693147 ≈ 2.321928. Correct. Then multiplying by log₅6: log₂5 × log₅6 = (ln5/ln2) × (ln6/ln5) = ln6 / ln2 = log₂6 ≈ 2.58496. Let me compute 2.321928 × log₅6 ≈ 2.321928 × 1.11328 ≈ 2.321928 × 1.11328. Let me compute 2.321928 × 1.11328. Let me note that log₂6 is indeed ln6 / ln2 ≈ 1.791759 / 0.693147 ≈ 2.58496. So that's correct. Then multiplying by log₆7: log₂6 × log₆7 = (ln6/ln2) × (ln7/ln6) = ln7 / ln2 = log₂7 ≈ 2.8073549. Let me check 2.58496 × log₆7 ≈ 2.58496 × 1.08603 ≈ 2.58496 × 1.086 ≈ Let me compute 2.58496 × 1 = 2.58496, 2.58496 × 0.086 ≈ 0.2223. Total ≈ 2.58496 + 0.2223 ≈ 2.80726, which matches log₂7 ≈ 2.80735. Close enough. Then multiplying by log₇8: log₂7 × log₇8 = (ln7/ln2) × (ln8/ln7) = ln8 / ln2 = log₂8 = 3. Exactly. Therefore, the final result is 3. Therefore, my previous numerical approximation had errors because I used incorrect approximate values for the later logarithms. Once I use more accurate decimal approximations, each step gives the correct telescoped log₂ of the next number, culminating in log₂8 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3. Therefore, the value of the product is 3.\n\nBut let me check once more with another approach. Let me use the property that log_b a = 1 / log_a b. Wait, but I don't see how that would help here directly. Alternatively, there's a formula for the product of consecutive logarithms where the base and the argument cancel out. Which is exactly what happened here. So the product from k=2 to n of log_k (k+1) would be log_2 (n+1). Wait, but here our product isn't exactly that because each log is log_{k}(k+1), but here we have log_2 3 * log_3 4 * ... * log_7 8. So starting at k=2 up to k=7, each term is log_k (k+1). Therefore, the product is log_2 8, since 8 is 2^3, so log_2 8 = 3. Therefore, this is a general formula. The product of log_b a where each subsequent base is the previous a, then the product telescopes to log_startbase_endargument. Therefore, in this case, starting base is 2, and the end argument is 8, so log_2 8 = 3. Therefore, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 3. Therefore, I think my initial conclusion was correct, and my numerical approximation earlier was flawed due to incorrect decimal approximations of the individual logs. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the product is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>"}
