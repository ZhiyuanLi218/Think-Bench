Let me start by recalling what I know about magnetic fields and their effect on moving charges. \n\nFirst, protons are positively charged particles, right? And when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force. The formula for the magnetic force is F = q(v × B), where q is the charge, v is the velocity vector, and B is the magnetic field. The cross product here means the force is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field direction. \n\nNow, the problem says the proton enters a region with a constant magnetic field B of magnitude 1.0 T. The initial speed is 1.5 × 10^6 m/s, and the velocity vector makes a 30° angle with the direction of B. The question is asking for the proton's speed 4 seconds later. The options are given, so maybe I can figure out if the speed changes or not?\n\nWait, magnetic force does no work on the particle because the force is always perpendicular to the velocity. That means the kinetic energy of the proton should remain constant, right? If kinetic energy is constant, then the speed should also remain constant. But wait, maybe I need to consider the direction of the velocity? Because the magnetic field can change the direction of the velocity but not its magnitude. \n\nBut hold on, the proton's velocity isn't entirely perpendicular to the magnetic field. It's at a 30° angle. So, does that mean part of the velocity is parallel to B and part is perpendicular? Let me think. If the velocity has a component parallel to B and a component perpendicular to B, then the magnetic field will affect those components differently. \n\nRight! The component of velocity parallel to the magnetic field (v_parallel) isn't affected by the magnetic force because the cross product of parallel vectors is zero. So, that component remains constant. However, the component of velocity perpendicular to B (v_perpendicular) will cause the proton to move in a circular path due to the centripetal force provided by the magnetic force. \n\nSo, the proton's motion will be a combination of uniform circular motion in the plane perpendicular to B and uniform linear motion along the direction of B. This results in a helical path. Since neither the parallel nor the perpendicular component of velocity changes in magnitude (only the direction of the perpendicular component changes), the total speed should remain the same as the initial speed. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the speed after 4 seconds. If the speed doesn't change, then the answer should be the same as the initial speed, which is 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. That would correspond to option C. \n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where the speed would change? For example, if there was an electric field or some other force, but the problem only mentions a magnetic field. Also, in the absence of other forces, the magnetic field can't do work on the proton, so kinetic energy is conserved. Therefore, speed must remain constant. \n\nBut maybe there's something I'm missing here. Let me recall the formula for the radius of the circular motion. The radius r is given by r = (m*v_perpendicular)/(q*B), where m is the mass of the proton, q is its charge. But that doesn't affect the speed, just the radius of the circular path. \n\nAlso, the period of the circular motion is T = (2π*m)/(q*B). Let me calculate that. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.67 × 10^-27 kg, charge is 1.6 × 10^-19 C, and B is 1.0 T. \n\nT = (2π * 1.67 × 10^-27) / (1.6 × 10^-19) ≈ (10.5 × 10^-27) / (1.6 × 10^-19) ≈ 6.56 × 10^-8 seconds. \n\nSo the period is about 6.56 × 10^-8 seconds, which is extremely short. That means that in 4 seconds, the proton would complete a huge number of orbits. However, since the motion is periodic, after each period, the perpendicular component of velocity returns to its original magnitude. Therefore, even though the direction changes continuously, the magnitude remains the same. \n\nTherefore, combining the parallel and perpendicular components, the total speed is sqrt(v_parallel^2 + v_perpendicular^2). Since neither of these components' magnitudes change over time, the total speed remains constant. \n\nLet me verify with components. The initial velocity has a component parallel to B: v_parallel = v_initial * cos(θ), where θ is 30°. Similarly, v_perpendicular = v_initial * sin(θ). After entering the magnetic field, v_parallel remains the same, and v_perpendicular remains the same in magnitude (though direction changes). Therefore, the speed at any time t is sqrt( (v_parallel)^2 + (v_perpendicular)^2 ) = v_initial. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the time, as long as there are no other forces, the speed should remain 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. Therefore, the answer is C. \n\nBut let me check if the question is trying to trick me. For example, if the problem had said \"velocity\" instead of \"speed,\" then the answer would depend on the direction. But since it's asking for speed, which is the magnitude of velocity, it should remain constant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a component of the magnetic field that I'm not considering? But the problem states it's a constant magnetic field, so no time variation. Also, the proton's motion in the magnetic field doesn't cause any change in B. \n\nAnother thought: if the proton is moving along the direction of B, there's no force. If it's moving perpendicular, it circles. Here it's a mix. But again, the speed components don't change. \n\nSo, unless there is some relativistic effect, but the initial speed is 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. Let me check what fraction of the speed of light that is. Speed of light is ~3 × 10^8 m/s. So 1.5 × 10^6 / 3 × 10^8 = 0.005, so 0.5% of the speed of light. Relativistic effects are negligible here, so classical mechanics applies. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:5.0 × 10^5, B:7.5 × 10^5, C: same as initial, D: higher. Since the speed can't increase in a magnetic field, D is out. A and B would suggest some loss of speed, but since magnetic fields don't do work, speed shouldn't change. Therefore, C is the answer. \n\nI think that's solid. The key point is that the magnetic field can only change the direction of the velocity, not its magnitude. Therefore, the speed remains the same. The angle given is just a distractor to see if you get confused about velocity vs. speed. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
