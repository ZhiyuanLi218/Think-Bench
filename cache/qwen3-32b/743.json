Let me start by visualizing the problem. There are two particles connected by a massless rod of length l, each with mass m. The system is moving on a smooth horizontal plane, which I assume means no friction. The center of mass is moving with velocity v, and there's also an angular velocity ω. The direction of ω is perpendicular to the plane, so it's a rotation in the plane. \n\nNow, one of the particles at one end collides perfectly inelastically with another stationary particle of mass m. The velocity direction of the moving particle is opposite to that of the center-of-mass velocity at the time of collision. I need to find the angular velocity after the collision.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a perfectly inelastic collision means. It means the colliding objects stick together after the collision. So, in this case, one of the moving particles (let's say particle A) will stick to the stationary particle (particle C). After the collision, particle A and particle C will move together as a single mass of 2m. The other particle (particle B) is still attached to the rod, so the system now has three masses? Wait, no. Wait, the original system is two particles connected by a rod. If one of them collides with another particle, then after collision, the system will have three particles? But the rod is connected to the original two particles. Wait, but if one particle collides with another particle, which is not connected by the rod, then after collision, maybe the new system is a combination of the rod with one original particle and the combined mass of the other original particle and the new particle?\n\nWait, the problem says \"one particle at one end undergoes a perfectly inelastic collision with another stationary particle also of mass m\". So, the original system is two particles connected by a rod. One of them (say, particle 1) is moving towards a third particle (particle 3), which is stationary. After collision, particle 1 and 3 stick together. The other original particle (particle 2) is still connected by the rod. So the new system is particle 2 connected to the rod, and the combined mass of particle 1 and 3 connected to the other end of the rod? Or is the rod still connecting the original two particles? Wait, the rod is between the two original particles. If one of them collides with another particle, the rod is still there. But if the collision happens at one end, then after collision, the mass at that end becomes 2m, while the other end remains m. So the system is still two masses connected by a rod, but one mass is now 2m instead of m. So the total mass is 3m? Wait, original system was 2m, then adding another m makes 3m. But the rod is only connecting the original two particles. Wait, but the third particle is not connected by the rod. Wait, maybe the collision occurs such that the third particle is at rest, and when the original particle collides with it, they stick together. But since the original particle was attached to the rod, after collision, the combined mass is still attached to the rod? So yes, the rod is now connecting particle 2 (mass m) and the combined mass of particle 1 and 3 (mass 2m). Therefore, the system after collision is a rod of length l connecting masses m and 2m. \n\nSo the problem is to find the angular velocity after the collision. Also, there's a mention that the velocity direction of the moving particle is opposite to that of the center-of-mass velocity at the time of collision. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me try to analyze the motion before collision. The system has center-of-mass velocity v and angular velocity ω. The rod is of length l, so each particle is moving with velocity due to the center-of-mass motion plus velocity due to rotation.\n\nLet me recall that for a rigid body, each point has velocity equal to the velocity of the center of mass plus the cross product of angular velocity and the position vector relative to the center of mass.\n\nSo, let me denote the center of mass velocity as V_cm = v (given). The angular velocity is ω, direction perpendicular to the plane, so if the motion is in the plane, say the xy-plane, then ω is along the z-axis. Let me assume that.\n\nSo, for each particle, their velocity is V_cm + ω × r_i, where r_i is the position vector relative to the center of mass.\n\nSince the rod is length l, and the two particles are each at a distance of l/2 from the center of mass? Wait, if the rod is length l, then the center of mass is at the midpoint between the two particles. So yes, each particle is at distance l/2 from the center of mass.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of each particle before collision is v ± ω × (l/2) depending on their position. Wait, direction depends on the direction of ω. Let me assume that the angular velocity is such that one particle is moving in the direction of v, and the other is moving opposite? Or not necessarily. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says that \"the velocity direction of the moving particle is opposite to that of the center-of-mass velocity at the time of collision\". So at the moment of collision, the particle that is going to collide has velocity opposite to v. Therefore, that must mean that before collision, one particle's velocity is v minus something, and the other is v plus something. Depending on the direction of rotation.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let me define coordinates. Let me suppose that the center of mass is moving along the x-axis with velocity v. Let me take the plane as xy-plane, and angular velocity ω in the z-direction. Let me suppose that the rod is rotating clockwise or counterclockwise? Let me suppose that at the moment of collision, the particle that is going to collide has velocity opposite to v (which is along x-axis). So if v is along x-axis, then the velocity of that particle is along negative x-axis.\n\nLet me consider that before collision, each particle has velocity:\n\nFor particle 1 (which will collide): V1 = v + ω × r1\n\nFor particle 2: V2 = v + ω × r2\n\nSince the center of mass is at the midpoint, r1 = -l/2 î (if the rod is along y-axis?) Wait, maybe I need to define the orientation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to define the orientation of the rod with respect to the motion. Let me think. Since the problem says that the velocity direction of the moving particle is opposite to that of the center-of-mass velocity at the time of collision. Let me suppose that at the moment of collision, the rod is oriented such that the particle that is going to collide is moving opposite to v.\n\nLet me try to imagine the system. Suppose the center of mass is moving along the x-axis. The rod is rotating with angular velocity ω. At the moment of collision, the particle that is going to collide has velocity opposite to the center of mass velocity. Let me suppose that the rod is at some angle θ with respect to the x-axis. However, maybe there is a specific orientation at the moment of collision. But perhaps the problem is set up such that regardless of the orientation, we can find the angular velocity after collision using conservation laws?\n\nWait, but maybe we need to consider the instantaneous velocities. Since it's a rigid body, the velocities are determined by the center of mass velocity and the angular velocity. So regardless of the orientation, the velocities of the particles are V_cm ± ω × (l/2) depending on direction.\n\nBut the problem says that the direction of the velocity of the particle is opposite to the center of mass velocity. So let me suppose that for one particle, the velocity is V_cm + something, and for the other, V_cm - something. Let me define it more precisely.\n\nLet me denote the position vectors of the two particles with respect to the center of mass. Since the rod is length l, each particle is at distance l/2 from the center of mass. Let me suppose that the rod is rotating with angular velocity ω. Then, the velocity of each particle relative to the center of mass is ω × r_i. So if the center of mass is moving with velocity v, then the total velocity of each particle is v + ω × r_i.\n\nNow, the problem states that the particle which collides has velocity direction opposite to the center of mass velocity. Let me suppose that the center of mass velocity is along positive x-axis. Let me suppose that the particle that collides has velocity along negative x-axis. Therefore, the velocity of that particle is -v_collision along x-axis. But the center of mass velocity is v along x-axis. Therefore, the velocity of that particle is opposite to the center of mass velocity.\n\nBut how does that relate to the angular velocity?\n\nLet me think. Let me denote for particle 1 (the one that collides), its velocity is V1 = v + ω × r1. We need V1 to be opposite to v. So V1 = -k v, where k is a positive scalar? Wait, but the problem says direction is opposite, so maybe magnitude can be different? Wait, but if it's a rigid body, the velocities are determined by the center of mass motion and rotation. So unless the rotation is such that the tangential velocity cancels the center of mass velocity for that particular particle.\n\nTherefore, suppose that for particle 1, V1 = v + ω × r1 = -v'. But the problem says \"the velocity direction of the moving particle is opposite to that of the center-of-mass velocity at the time of collision\". So direction is opposite, but magnitude may not be specified. However, since it's a rigid body, the velocity of the particle is determined by v and ω.\n\nTherefore, let me suppose that the velocity of particle 1 is opposite in direction to v. Let me suppose that v is along x-axis. Let me suppose that the rod is at some angle θ with respect to the x-axis. The position vector of particle 1 relative to the center of mass is r1. Let me write r1 in coordinates. Let me suppose that the center of mass is at origin for simplicity. Then particle 1 is at position vector r1, and particle 2 is at position vector -r1. Since the rod is length l, |r1| = l/2.\n\nThe velocity of particle 1 is V1 = v + ω × r1. Similarly for particle 2: V2 = v + ω × (-r1) = v - ω × r1.\n\nGiven that V1 is opposite to v. Let me write this as V1 = -k v, where k is a scalar. However, since V1 is a vector, if v is along x-axis, then V1 must be along -x-axis. Therefore, the cross product ω × r1 must be such that when added to v gives a vector along -x-axis.\n\nLet me suppose that ω is along z-axis, so ω = ω k̂. Let me define r1 in terms of coordinates. Let me suppose that the rod is at angle θ with respect to x-axis. Therefore, the position vector of particle 1 relative to center of mass is r1 = (l/2) cosθ î + (l/2) sinθ ĵ.\n\nThen, ω × r1 = ω k̂ × [ (l/2) cosθ î + (l/2) sinθ ĵ ] = ω [ - (l/2) sinθ î + (l/2) cosθ ĵ ].\n\nTherefore, V1 = v î + ω [ - (l/2) sinθ î + (l/2) cosθ ĵ ].\n\nWe want this velocity to be along -x direction. Therefore, the y-component must be zero, and the x-component must be negative.\n\nSo, setting the y-component to zero:\n\nω (l/2) cosθ = 0.\n\nThis implies that cosθ = 0, so θ = π/2 or 3π/2. Therefore, the rod is perpendicular to the x-axis at the moment of collision. Let me take θ = π/2, so the rod is along y-axis. Therefore, position vector of particle 1 is r1 = (l/2) cos(π/2) î + (l/2) sin(π/2) ĵ = 0 î + (l/2) ĵ.\n\nThen, ω × r1 = ω k̂ × (l/2) ĵ = ω (l/2) î × k̂ ? Wait, no:\n\nWait, k̂ × ĵ = -î. Wait, cross product: k̂ × ĵ = -î. Because î × ĵ = k̂, ĵ × k̂ = î, k̂ × î = ĵ. And cross product is anti-commutative. So k̂ × ĵ = - (ĵ × k̂) = - î. Therefore, yes:\n\nω × r1 = ω k̂ × (l/2) ĵ = ω (l/2) (k̂ × ĵ) = ω (l/2)( - î ) = - ω (l/2) î.\n\nTherefore, V1 = v î - ω (l/2) î = [v - ω l / 2 ] î. \n\nWe want this velocity to be opposite to v, i.e., direction opposite. Therefore, [v - ω l / 2 ] must be negative. Therefore, v - ω l / 2 < 0 => ω l / 2 > v. But the problem does not specify any relation between v and ω. However, the problem says that \"the velocity direction of the moving particle is opposite to that of the center-of-mass velocity at the time of collision\". Therefore, this condition must hold: v - ω l / 2 < 0. So the velocity of particle 1 is along -x direction. \n\nTherefore, at the moment of collision, the rod is along y-axis, and particle 1 is at the top end, moving along -x direction. The other particle (particle 2) is at the bottom end, with velocity V2 = v + ω × (-r1) = v + ω × (- (l/2) ĵ ) = v + ω k̂ × (- l/2 ĵ ) = v + ω l / 2 î. Therefore, V2 = [v + ω l / 2 ] î. So particle 2 is moving along +x direction with velocity greater than v, since ω l / 2 is positive.\n\nSo this is the setup before collision. Now, particle 1 collides with a stationary particle of mass m. Let me assume that the stationary particle is located at the position where particle 1 is at the moment of collision. Since particle 1 is moving along -x direction towards this stationary particle. The collision is perfectly inelastic, so they stick together.\n\nNow, I need to find the angular velocity after the collision. Also, since the collision is inelastic, kinetic energy is not conserved, but linear momentum and angular momentum should be conserved, assuming no external forces. The problem says it's on a smooth horizontal plane, so no friction, so during collision, the only forces are internal between the colliding particles. Therefore, linear momentum and angular momentum of the entire system (original two particles + the third particle) should be conserved.\n\nWait, but initially, the system is only the two particles connected by the rod. Then, there is a third particle, initially stationary. So the total system before collision is the two-particle system plus the third particle. After collision, the third particle is part of the system. Therefore, we need to consider conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum for the entire system (original two particles + third particle). \n\nSo, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the linear momentum before collision. The original two-particle system has total mass 2m, moving with center of mass velocity v, so total linear momentum is 2m v. The third particle is stationary, so total initial linear momentum is 2m v. After collision, the system will have the combined mass of 2m (original two particles) plus the third particle? Wait, no. Wait, one of the original particles collides with the third particle. So after collision, the masses are:\n\n- The original particle 2 (mass m) connected to the rod.\n\n- The combined mass of particle 1 and the third particle (mass m + m = 2m) connected to the other end of the rod.\n\nTherefore, total mass is 3m. So the total linear momentum after collision should still be 2m v, because there are no external forces. Therefore, the center of mass velocity of the entire system (original two particles + third particle) will change. Wait, but initially, the total mass is 2m + m = 3m? Wait, no. Wait, initially, before collision, there are two particles (mass 2m) moving with velocity v, and a third particle (mass m) at rest. Therefore, total initial linear momentum is 2m v + 0 = 2m v. After collision, the total mass is 3m (original two particles plus third one?), but actually, the third particle is only added to one of the original particles. Wait, the original system is two particles connected by a rod. The third particle is external. So before collision, total mass of the entire system (original two + third) is 3m. After collision, the same. Therefore, linear momentum is conserved. \n\nBut angular momentum should also be conserved, because there are no external torques. Since the collision is internal to the system (original two particles + third), and assuming the collision occurs at the end of the rod, which is part of the system. Wait, but the third particle is not connected by the rod initially. However, after collision, it becomes connected? Or is the rod still only connecting the original two particles? Wait, the problem says \"the system is composed of two particles... connected at the ends of a rigid rod\". So the rod is between the two original particles. When one of them collides with a third particle, does the rod stay connected? The problem says \"in this system, one particle... undergoes a collision...\". It doesn't specify whether the rod remains connected to the combined mass. But since the rod is rigid and connects the two original particles, if one of them collides and sticks to another particle, I think the rod remains connected to the combined mass. So after collision, the system is still two masses connected by the rod: one mass is m (original particle 2) and the other is 2m (original particle 1 + third particle). Therefore, the rod's length is still l. Therefore, the system after collision is a rigid rod of length l with masses m and 2m at its ends. \n\nTherefore, the entire system (original two particles + third) has its linear momentum conserved, and angular momentum conserved. Therefore, we can use conservation of linear momentum and conservation of angular momentum to find the new center of mass velocity and angular velocity.\n\nBut perhaps we need to compute the angular momentum about a particular point. Usually, for rigid body collisions, it's useful to compute angular momentum about the center of mass, or about a fixed point. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since there are no external forces or torques during the collision, both linear momentum and angular momentum of the entire system (original two particles + third) are conserved. Therefore, I can compute the initial angular momentum of the entire system (before collision) and set it equal to the final angular momentum (after collision), and similarly for linear momentum.\n\nFirst, let me compute the initial linear momentum. As mentioned, it's 2m v. After collision, the total mass is 3m, so the new center of mass velocity V' must satisfy 3m V' = 2m v => V' = (2/3) v. Therefore, the center of mass velocity after collision is 2v/3.\n\nBut we also need to find the angular velocity after collision. For that, let's compute the initial angular momentum and set it equal to the final angular momentum.\n\nTo compute angular momentum, I need to choose a point. Since there are no external torques, angular momentum is conserved about any point. However, it might be convenient to choose the initial center of mass of the entire system or the final center of mass. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since before collision, the original two-particle system has its own center of mass moving with velocity v. The third particle is stationary. Let me find the initial angular momentum of the entire system (original two particles + third) about some point. Maybe it's easier to take the initial center of mass of the entire system.\n\nWait, before collision, the entire system (original two particles + third) has a center of mass. Let me compute that. The original two particles are at positions... Well, actually, I need to know their positions. But since the problem is about the moment of collision, and at that moment, the rod is along y-axis (as we deduced earlier). Let me try to model the positions.\n\nAt the moment of collision, let's assume that the center of mass of the original two-particle system is at some point, say, the origin for simplicity. Then, particle 1 is at (0, l/2), particle 2 is at (0, -l/2). The third particle is at the same position as particle 1, which is (0, l/2), because particle 1 is about to collide with it. Wait, but if particle 1 is moving along -x direction towards the third particle, which is stationary. So at the moment of collision, particle 1 is at the position of the third particle. Therefore, before collision, the third particle is located at the position where particle 1 is at the moment of collision. Let me suppose that at the moment of collision, particle 1 is at position (0, l/2), and the third particle is also at (0, l/2), stationary. \n\nTherefore, the entire system before collision has:\n\n- Particle 1: mass m, position (0, l/2), velocity V1 = [v - ω l / 2 ] î (along -x direction, since we had earlier that this is negative).\n\n- Particle 2: mass m, position (0, -l/2), velocity V2 = [v + ω l / 2 ] î (along +x direction).\n\n- Particle 3: mass m, position (0, l/2), velocity 0.\n\nTherefore, total linear momentum is m V1 + m V2 + m * 0 = m [v - ω l / 2 + v + ω l / 2 ] î = m [2v] î = 2m v î, which matches earlier conclusion.\n\nNow, let me compute the angular momentum of the entire system before collision. Let me choose the origin as the point about which to calculate angular momentum. The origin is the center of mass of the original two-particle system. However, with particle 3 added, the center of mass of the entire system will be different. But since angular momentum is conserved about any point, I can choose origin as the original center of mass.\n\nSo, angular momentum L_initial is the sum of the angular momenta of the three particles about the origin.\n\nFor particle 1: position vector r1 = 0 î + (l/2) ĵ. Velocity v1 = [v - ω l / 2 ] î. Angular momentum L1 = r1 × (m v1).\n\nSimilarly for particle 2: position vector r2 = 0 î - (l/2) ĵ. Velocity v2 = [v + ω l / 2 ] î. Angular momentum L2 = r2 × (m v2).\n\nParticle 3: position vector r3 = 0 î + (l/2) ĵ. Velocity v3 = 0. Angular momentum L3 = r3 × (m v3) = 0.\n\nTherefore, total initial angular momentum L_initial = L1 + L2 + L3.\n\nCompute L1:\n\nr1 × (m v1) = [ (l/2) ĵ ] × [ m (v - ω l / 2 ) î ] = m (v - ω l / 2 ) (l/2) (ĵ × î ) = m (v - ω l / 2 ) (l/2) (-k̂ ) = - m (v - ω l / 2 ) (l/2) k̂.\n\nSimilarly, L2:\n\nr2 × (m v2) = [ - (l/2) ĵ ] × [ m (v + ω l / 2 ) î ] = - m (v + ω l / 2 ) (l/2) (ĵ × î ) = - m (v + ω l / 2 ) (l/2) (-k̂ ) = + m (v + ω l / 2 ) (l/2) k̂.\n\nTherefore, total L_initial = [ - m (v - ω l / 2 ) (l/2) + m (v + ω l / 2 ) (l/2) ] k̂.\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\nFactor out m (l/2):\n\nm (l/2) [ - (v - ω l / 2 ) + (v + ω l / 2 ) ] = m (l/2) [ -v + ω l / 2 + v + ω l / 2 ] = m (l/2) [ ω l ] = m (l/2)(ω l) = (m ω l²)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_initial = (m ω l²)/2 k̂.\n\nSo the initial angular momentum about the origin (original center of mass) is (m ω l²)/2 in the positive z-direction.\n\nNow, let's compute the final angular momentum after collision. After collision, the system consists of:\n\n- Particle 2: mass m, position (0, -l/2), connected to the rod.\n\n- Combined mass of particle 1 and 3: mass 2m, at position (0, l/2), connected to the rod.\n\nThe entire system is now a rigid rod of length l with masses m and 2m at its ends. The system will have a new center of mass velocity V' = (2/3) v î as computed earlier. Additionally, it will have some angular velocity ω', which we need to find.\n\nTo compute the final angular momentum, again about the origin (original center of mass), we need to consider the angular momentum due to the motion of the center of mass of the entire system and the angular momentum due to rotation about the center of mass. However, since angular momentum is conserved about the origin, maybe it's easier to compute the final angular momentum directly.\n\nBut first, let's find the motion of the system after collision. The system has center of mass velocity V' = (2/3) v î. However, the system also may be rotating with angular velocity ω'. Therefore, each particle's velocity is the velocity of the center of mass plus the velocity due to rotation.\n\nBut to compute angular momentum about the origin, we need to know the position and velocity of each particle.\n\nFirst, let's find the center of mass of the final system. The final system has masses m at (0, -l/2) and 2m at (0, l/2). Therefore, the center of mass position R_cm' is:\n\nR_cm' = [ m*(0, -l/2) + 2m*(0, l/2) ] / (m + 2m) = [ (0, -m l / 2 + 2m l / 2 ) ] / 3m = [ (0, m l / 2 ) ] / 3m = (0, l / 6 ).\n\nSo the center of mass of the final system is at (0, l/6). \n\nBut before collision, the center of mass of the entire system (original two + third) was at:\n\nOriginal two particles: center of mass at origin. Third particle at (0, l/2). Total center of mass:\n\nR_initial_cm = [ 2m*(0) + m*(0, l/2) ] / (3m) = (0, l/6). Wait! So actually, the center of mass of the entire system before collision is also at (0, l/6). Interesting. Because initially, the original two particles had center of mass at origin, and the third particle is at (0, l/2). Therefore, the total center of mass is ( (2m * 0 + m * 0)/3m , (2m * 0 + m * l/2)/3m ) = (0, l/6). Therefore, the center of mass of the entire system is at (0, l/6) both before and after collision. Since there are no external forces, the center of mass moves with constant velocity. Before collision, the center of mass velocity was V_initial_cm = (2m v + 0)/3m = 2v/3, which matches our previous result. Therefore, after collision, the center of mass velocity remains 2v/3 î.\n\nTherefore, when computing angular momentum about the origin, which is not the center of mass of the entire system, we have to take into account both the motion of the center of mass and the rotation about the center of mass. However, since angular momentum is conserved about the origin, let's proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute angular momentum about the center of mass of the entire system, which is at (0, l/6). However, since we already computed L_initial about the origin, and we need to compute L_final about the same origin to set them equal, let's proceed with origin.\n\nAfter collision, the system consists of two particles: mass m at (0, -l/2) and mass 2m at (0, l/2). Their velocities are determined by the center of mass motion plus rotation.\n\nLet me denote the velocity of each particle as V' + ω' × r_i', where V' is the velocity of the center of mass of the final system (which is 2v/3 î), and r_i' is the position vector of each particle relative to the center of mass of the final system.\n\nFirst, let's find the position vectors relative to the final center of mass, which is at (0, l/6). \n\nFor the mass m at (0, -l/2):\n\nPosition relative to final center of mass: (0 - 0, -l/2 - l/6) = (0, - (2l/3)).\n\nFor the mass 2m at (0, l/2):\n\nPosition relative to final center of mass: (0 - 0, l/2 - l/6) = (0, l/3).\n\nTherefore, the position vectors relative to the final center of mass are:\n\nr1' = 0 î - (2l/3) ĵ\n\nr2' = 0 î + (l/3) ĵ\n\nNow, the velocity of each particle is V' + ω' × r_i'. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, V' = 2v/3 î.\n\nFor the mass m at position (0, -l/2):\n\nVelocity V1' = V' + ω' × r1'\n\nSimilarly for the mass 2m:\n\nVelocity V2' = V' + ω' × r2'\n\nAssuming ω' is along z-axis, same as before.\n\nCompute ω' × r1':\n\nω' k̂ × [ - (2l/3) ĵ ] = ω' ( -2l/3 ) (k̂ × ĵ ) = ω' ( -2l/3 ) (-î ) = ω' (2l/3) î.\n\nSimilarly, ω' × r2':\n\nω' k̂ × (l/3) ĵ = ω' (l/3) (k̂ × ĵ ) = ω' (l/3)( -î ) = - ω' (l/3) î.\n\nTherefore, velocities:\n\nFor mass m:\n\nV1' = 2v/3 î + ω' (2l/3) î = [ 2v/3 + 2 ω' l / 3 ] î.\n\nFor mass 2m:\n\nV2' = 2v/3 î - ω' (l/3) î = [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] î.\n\nNow, we need to compute the angular momentum of the final system about the origin. The angular momentum L_final is the sum of the angular momenta of the two particles (mass m and 2m) about the origin.\n\nFor each particle, angular momentum is r_i × (m_i v_i'), where r_i is the position vector from the origin to the particle.\n\nMass m is at (0, -l/2), velocity [ 2v/3 + 2 ω' l / 3 ] î.\n\nMass 2m is at (0, l/2), velocity [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] î.\n\nCompute L_final:\n\nL_final = [ (0 î - l/2 ĵ ) × m [ 2v/3 + 2 ω' l / 3 ] î ] + [ (0 î + l/2 ĵ ) × 2m [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] î ].\n\nLet me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: ( - l/2 ĵ ) × m [ ... ] î = - m (l/2) [ ... ] (ĵ × î ) = - m (l/2) [ ... ] (-k̂ ) = + m (l/2) [ ... ] k̂.\n\nSecond term: ( + l/2 ĵ ) × 2m [ ... ] î = + 2m (l/2) [ ... ] (ĵ × î ) = + 2m (l/2) [ ... ] (-k̂ ) = - m l [ ... ] k̂.\n\nTherefore, total L_final:\n\n[ m (l/2) [ 2v/3 + 2 ω' l / 3 ] - m l [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] ] k̂.\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\nFirst term: m (l/2) [ 2v/3 + 2 ω' l / 3 ]\n\nSecond term: - m l [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ]\n\nLet me compute them:\n\nFirst term:\n\n= m l / 2 * 2v/3 + m l / 2 * 2 ω' l / 3\n\n= m l v / 3 + m ω' l² / 3\n\nSecond term:\n\n= - m l * 2v / 3 + m l * ω' l / 3\n\n= - 2 m l v / 3 + m ω' l² / 3\n\nTherefore, total coefficient:\n\n[ m l v / 3 + m ω' l² / 3 - 2 m l v / 3 + m ω' l² / 3 ] \n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor m l v terms: (1/3 - 2/3) m l v = (-1/3) m l v\n\nFor m ω' l² terms: (1/3 + 1/3) m ω' l² = (2/3) m ω' l²\n\nTherefore, total coefficient: - (1/3) m l v + (2/3) m ω' l²\n\nTherefore, L_final = [ - (1/3) m l v + (2/3) m ω' l² ] k̂.\n\nNow, since angular momentum is conserved, L_initial = L_final.\n\nEarlier, L_initial was (m ω l²)/2 k̂.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(m ω l²)/2 = - (1/3) m l v + (2/3) m ω' l² \n\nWe can divide both sides by m:\n\n(ω l²)/2 = - (1/3) l v + (2/3) ω' l² \n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(3 ω l²)/2 = - l v + 2 ω' l² \n\nDivide both sides by l:\n\n(3 ω l)/2 = - v + 2 ω' l \n\nRearranged:\n\n2 ω' l = (3 ω l)/2 + v \n\nDivide both sides by l:\n\n2 ω' = (3 ω)/2 + v / l \n\nTherefore:\n\nω' = (3 ω)/4 + v / (2 l )\n\nWait, that's the result? Let me check my algebra again.\n\nWait:\n\nStarting from:\n\n(ω l²)/2 = - (1/3) l v + (2/3) ω' l² \n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n(3 ω l²)/2 = - l v + 2 ω' l² \n\nYes.\n\nThen divide both sides by l²:\n\n(3 ω)/2 = - v / l + 2 ω'\n\nThen rearrange:\n\n2 ω' = (3 ω)/2 + v / l \n\nTherefore:\n\nω' = (3 ω)/4 + v / (2 l )\n\nHmm. So angular velocity after collision is 3ω/4 plus v/(2l). Is this correct? Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation of L_final again. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nOriginal L_final expression:\n\n[ - (1/3) m l v + (2/3) m ω' l² ] k̂ equals to initial angular momentum (m ω l²)/2.\n\nYes. Then dividing by m:\n\n(ω l²)/2 = - (1/3) l v + (2/3) ω' l² \n\nYes. Then multiplying by 3:\n\n(3/2) ω l² = - l v + 2 ω' l² \n\nDivide both sides by l²:\n\n(3/2) ω = - v / l + 2 ω'\n\nYes. Then:\n\n2 ω' = (3/2) ω + v / l \n\nTherefore:\n\nω' = (3/4) ω + v / (2 l )\n\nYes. So that seems correct. \n\nBut let me think about the physical meaning. The angular velocity after collision depends on both the initial angular velocity ω and the initial linear velocity v. That seems plausible because the collision affects both the rotational and translational motion. \n\nBut let me check if there is another way to get this result, maybe by considering conservation of angular momentum about the center of mass of the entire system. Maybe that would be simpler?\n\nLet me try that approach. Since angular momentum is conserved about any point, let's take the center of mass of the entire system, which is at (0, l/6) as we found earlier.\n\nCompute initial angular momentum about this point, and set equal to final angular momentum.\n\nFirst, initial angular momentum about the center of mass.\n\nBefore collision, the system has three particles: particle 1 at (0, l/2), particle 2 at (0, -l/2), particle 3 at (0, l/2). The center of mass is at (0, l/6). \n\nLet me compute the position vectors of each particle relative to the center of mass:\n\nFor particle 1: position (0, l/2) - (0, l/6) = (0, l/2 - l/6) = (0, l/3)\n\nFor particle 2: position (0, -l/2) - (0, l/6) = (0, -2l/3)\n\nFor particle 3: position (0, l/2) - (0, l/6) = (0, l/3)\n\nVelocities of the particles are:\n\nParticle 1: V1 = [v - ω l / 2 ] î\n\nParticle 2: V2 = [v + ω l / 2 ] î\n\nParticle 3: V3 = 0\n\nTherefore, angular momentum about the center of mass is the sum of r_i × m_i v_i for each particle.\n\nCompute for each particle:\n\nParticle 1: r1' = (0, l/3) = l/3 ĵ. Velocity v1 = [v - ω l / 2 ] î. Angular momentum L1 = r1' × m v1 = (l/3 ĵ ) × m [v - ω l / 2 ] î = m [v - ω l / 2 ] (l/3) (ĵ × î ) = m [v - ω l / 2 ] (l/3)( -k̂ ) = - m [v - ω l / 2 ] (l/3) k̂.\n\nParticle 2: r2' = (0, -2l/3) = -2l/3 ĵ. Velocity v2 = [v + ω l / 2 ] î. Angular momentum L2 = (-2l/3 ĵ ) × m [v + ω l / 2 ] î = -2m [v + ω l / 2 ] (l/3) (ĵ × î ) = -2m [v + ω l / 2 ] (l/3)( -k̂ ) = + 2m [v + ω l / 2 ] (l/3) k̂.\n\nParticle 3: r3' = (0, l/3) = l/3 ĵ. Velocity v3 = 0. Angular momentum L3 = 0.\n\nTotal initial angular momentum about center of mass:\n\nL_initial' = [ - m [v - ω l / 2 ] (l/3) + 2m [v + ω l / 2 ] (l/3) ] k̂.\n\nCompute the coefficient:\n\nFactor out m l / 3:\n\nm l / 3 [ - (v - ω l / 2 ) + 2(v + ω l / 2 ) ]\n\n= m l / 3 [ -v + ω l / 2 + 2v + ω l ] \n\n= m l / 3 [ v + (3 ω l ) / 2 ]\n\nTherefore, L_initial' = m l / 3 [ v + (3 ω l ) / 2 ] k̂.\n\nNow, compute the final angular momentum about the center of mass. After collision, the system is a rigid body with masses m and 2m at the ends of the rod, rotating with angular velocity ω' and moving with center of mass velocity V' = 2v/3 î. The angular momentum about the center of mass is the rotational angular momentum, which is I ω', where I is the moment of inertia about the center of mass.\n\nFirst, compute the moment of inertia of the final system about its center of mass. The final center of mass is at (0, l/6), as before. The masses are m at (0, -l/2) and 2m at (0, l/2). The distances from the center of mass are:\n\nFor mass m: distance from (0, -l/2) to (0, l/6) is l/2 + l/6 = 2l/3.\n\nFor mass 2m: distance from (0, l/2) to (0, l/6) is l/2 - l/6 = l/3.\n\nTherefore, moment of inertia I = m (2l/3)^2 + 2m (l/3)^2 = m (4l²/9) + 2m (l²/9) = (4m l² / 9) + (2m l² / 9) = 6m l² / 9 = 2m l² / 3.\n\nTherefore, final angular momentum about center of mass is L_final' = I ω' = (2m l² / 3) ω' k̂.\n\nSince angular momentum is conserved about the center of mass, L_initial' = L_final':\n\nm l / 3 [ v + (3 ω l ) / 2 ] = (2m l² / 3) ω'\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\nm l [ v + (3 ω l ) / 2 ] = 2m l² ω'\n\nDivide both sides by m l:\n\nv + (3 ω l ) / 2 = 2 l ω'\n\nTherefore:\n\nω' = [ v + (3 ω l ) / 2 ] / (2 l ) = v / (2 l ) + (3 ω ) / 4 \n\nWhich is the same result as before! So that confirms that ω' = (3/4) ω + v / (2 l ). \n\nTherefore, the angular velocity after collision is 3ω/4 + v/(2l). \n\nBut let me check if the question expects the answer in terms of ω and v and l. The problem says \"Find the angular velocity after the collision.\" So probably express it as a formula. Let me check if there is any other consideration.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says the collision is perfectly inelastic. Also, we have considered conservation of angular momentum and linear momentum. But is there any other factor?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can approach this problem by considering the collision as an instantaneous impulse. However, since we already did it via conservation laws and got consistent results, probably this is correct.\n\nBut let me check with numbers. Let me take a case where v = 0. If initially, the system is just rotating with angular velocity ω, no center of mass motion. Then, one particle collides with a stationary particle. What would be the angular velocity after collision?\n\nIn this case, v = 0. Then, according to our formula, ω' = 3ω/4 + 0 = 3ω/4. Is this correct?\n\nLet me think. Initially, angular momentum about the center of mass of the entire system. When v = 0, the original system (two masses) has angular momentum. The third particle is stationary. The center of mass of the entire system is at (0, l/6). The initial angular momentum would be as calculated earlier: m l / 3 [ 0 + (3 ω l ) / 2 ] = m l / 3 * 3 ω l / 2 = m ω l² / 2. The moment of inertia after collision is 2m l² / 3. Therefore, ω' = (m ω l² / 2 ) / (2m l² / 3 ) = (ω / 2 ) / (2 / 3 ) = (ω / 2 ) * (3 / 2 ) = 3 ω / 4. Yes, that's correct. So if there is no initial linear motion, the angular velocity decreases from ω to 3ω/4 due to increase in moment of inertia. Makes sense.\n\nAnother check: suppose ω = 0 initially, so the system is just translating with velocity v, no rotation. After collision, what is ω'?\n\nAccording to formula: ω' = 0 + v / (2 l ). Let's check with angular momentum. Initially, angular momentum about the center of mass of the entire system. Since there's no rotation, only translation. The angular momentum should be due to the linear motion.\n\nThe initial angular momentum about the center of mass (at (0, l/6)) is the sum of the individual angular momenta. For each particle:\n\nParticle 1: position (0, l/2), velocity v î. The vector from center of mass to particle 1 is (0, l/3). Angular momentum is r × p = (l/3 ĵ ) × m v î = - m v l / 3 k̂.\n\nParticle 2: position (0, -l/2), velocity v î. Vector from center of mass is (0, -2l/3). Angular momentum is (-2l/3 ĵ ) × m v î = + 2 m v l / 3 k̂.\n\nParticle 3: position (0, l/2), velocity 0. Angular momentum 0.\n\nTotal initial angular momentum: (- m v l / 3 + 2 m v l / 3 ) k̂ = m v l / 3 k̂.\n\nFinal angular momentum is I ω' = (2m l² / 3 ) ω'. Setting equal:\n\n(2m l² / 3 ) ω' = m v l / 3 => ω' = (m v l / 3 ) / (2m l² / 3 ) = v / (2 l ). Correct. Therefore, the formula holds. Therefore, our result seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the angular velocity after collision is ω' = (3/4) ω + v/(2 l ). \n\nBut let me check the problem statement again. The problem says \"the velocity direction of the moving particle is opposite to that of the center-of-mass velocity at the time of collision\". In our analysis, we used that condition to determine that the rod is perpendicular to the direction of motion at the moment of collision. However, in our final formula, we have both ω and v contributing. The problem didn't specify any particular relation between v and ω, so our answer is general.\n\nBut let me check if there is a different approach. For example, using conservation of angular momentum about the point of collision. Since during the collision, the forces between particle 1 and particle 3 are internal, but if we take the point of collision as the axis, then there may be no external torque. Let me try that.\n\nAt the moment of collision, the collision occurs at position (0, l/2). If we take this point as the axis, then compute angular momentum before and after.\n\nBefore collision, the angular momentum about this point is the sum of angular momentum of particle 1, particle 2, and particle 3 about this point.\n\nParticle 1 is at (0, l/2), so its position vector relative to the axis is zero. Therefore, its angular momentum is zero.\n\nParticle 2 is at (0, -l/2). Its position vector relative to the axis is (0, -l/2) - (0, l/2) = (0, -l). Velocity of particle 2 is [v + ω l / 2 ] î. Angular momentum is r × p = (-l ĵ ) × m [v + ω l / 2 ] î = - m l [v + ω l / 2 ] (ĵ × î ) = - m l [v + ω l / 2 ] (-k̂ ) = + m l [v + ω l / 2 ] k̂.\n\nParticle 3 is at (0, l/2), same as the axis, so angular momentum zero.\n\nTherefore, total initial angular momentum about the collision point is m l [v + ω l / 2 ] k̂.\n\nAfter collision, the combined mass (2m) is at the collision point, so its angular momentum about that point is zero. The other mass (m) is at (0, -l/2). Its position relative to the collision point is (0, -l). Its velocity is... ?\n\nAfter collision, the system has center of mass velocity V' = 2v/3 î and angular velocity ω'. The velocity of particle 2 (mass m) is V' + ω' × r', where r' is its position relative to the final center of mass. Earlier we found that particle 2's velocity is [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] î. Alternatively, since we are calculating angular momentum about the collision point, maybe we can find its velocity another way.\n\nBut since angular momentum is conserved about the collision point, let's compute the final angular momentum.\n\nThe final angular momentum about the collision point is the angular momentum of the mass m at (0, -l/2). Its position vector relative to the collision point is (0, -l). Its velocity is [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] î. Therefore, angular momentum is r × p = (-l ĵ ) × m [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] î = - m l [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] (ĵ × î ) = - m l [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] (-k̂ ) = + m l [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] k̂.\n\nAdditionally, the combined mass at the collision point has zero angular momentum. Therefore, total final angular momentum is m l [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] k̂.\n\nSetting initial and final equal:\n\nm l [v + ω l / 2 ] = m l [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ]\n\nCancel m l:\n\nv + ω l / 2 = 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 \n\nRearrange:\n\nω' l / 3 = 2v/3 - v - ω l / 2 \n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n(2v/3 - 3v/3) - ω l / 2 = (-v/3) - ω l / 2 \n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\nω' l = -v - (3 ω l ) / 2 \n\nTherefore:\n\nω' = -v / l - (3 ω ) / 2 \n\nWait, this contradicts our previous result. What is happening here? There must be a mistake. Earlier, we had ω' = 3ω/4 + v/(2l), but here we get ω' = -v/l - 3ω/2. This inconsistency suggests an error in one of the approaches.\n\nThis is concerning. Let me check my calculations here.\n\nStarting from angular momentum about the collision point:\n\nInitial angular momentum is m l [v + ω l / 2 ].\n\nFinal angular momentum is m l [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ].\n\nSetting equal:\n\nv + ω l / 2 = 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 \n\nSolving for ω':\n\nBring terms with ω' to one side and others to the other:\n\nω' l / 3 = 2v/3 - v - ω l / 2 \n\nCompute 2v/3 - v = -v/3, so:\n\nω' l / 3 = -v/3 - ω l / 2 \n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\nω' l = -v - (3 ω l ) / 2 \n\nDivide by l:\n\nω' = -v / l - (3 ω ) / 2 \n\nThis is different from previous result. But why?\n\nThis suggests a contradiction. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me check the final angular momentum about the collision point. The final angular momentum is only due to mass m at (0, -l/2). Its velocity is [ 2v/3 - ω' l / 3 ] î, as we calculated earlier. However, is this correct?\n\nWait, when calculating velocity of mass m after collision, we considered the center of mass velocity plus rotation. But if we are calculating angular momentum about the collision point, which is different from the center of mass, perhaps we need to recalculate the velocity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an error in assuming that the angular momentum is conserved about the collision point. Wait, during the collision, are there any external torques about the collision point?\n\nThe collision occurs at the collision point. The forces during collision are internal between particle 1 and particle 3. However, particle 1 is connected to the rod, which is connected to particle 2. Therefore, during the collision, there might be forces at the rod connection (between particle 1 and particle 2) which could exert torque about the collision point. Therefore, angular momentum is not conserved about the collision point because there are external torques from the rod. Therefore, my previous assumption was wrong. Hence, this approach is invalid. Therefore, the first method using conservation about the center of mass is correct, and this second approach is invalid due to external torques. Therefore, the correct result is ω' = 3ω/4 + v/(2l). \n\nTherefore, the answer is ω' = (3/4)ω + v/(2l). \n\nBut let me check with numbers again. Suppose ω = 0 and v ≠ 0. Then ω' = v/(2l). Earlier, when we did the center of mass approach, we saw that this is correct. If we take the case where the system is translating with velocity v, no rotation, and after collision, it has angular velocity v/(2l). Which makes sense because the collision imparts a rotational motion. \n\nAlternatively, if v = 0 and ω ≠ 0, then ω' = 3ω/4, which also makes sense because the moment of inertia increases, so angular velocity decreases. \n\nTherefore, the formula seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be ω' = (3/4)ω + v/(2l). \n\nBut let me check the units. ω has units of 1/s, v/l has units of 1/s, so the formula is dimensionally consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular velocity after the collision is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}\\omega + \\dfrac{v}{2l}}.\n</think>"}
