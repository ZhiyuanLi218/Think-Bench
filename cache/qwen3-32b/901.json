Rest Frame (S') Assumptions**\n\nIn the rest frame of the $\\eta^{\\prime}$ meson (frame $S'$), the decay is **isotropic**.

The problem says that the decay is isotropic in the rest frame of η', but we need to find the distribution in the lab frame where the η' is moving with velocity v. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with particle decays in different reference frames, Lorentz transformations are essential. Since the decay is isotropic in the rest frame, the photon's direction is uniformly distributed in that frame. But in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the rest frame, the distribution will be distorted due to relativistic effects like beaming.\n\nSo, the key idea here is to relate the angular distribution in the rest frame (where it's isotropic) to the lab frame. To do this, I need to use the Lorentz transformation for angles. But let me recall the exact method.\n\nIn the rest frame of η', let's denote it as S', and the lab frame as S. The η' is moving with velocity v in the lab frame, so in S, the S' frame is moving at velocity -v along the same axis (let's say the z-axis for simplicity). The decay is isotropic in S', so the photon can be emitted in any direction with equal probability. However, when we boost to the lab frame, the angles of the emitted photons will change.\n\nBut how exactly does the angle transform? I think there's a formula for the relation between the angle in the lab frame and the angle in the rest frame. Let me recall. The formula for the transformation of angles under Lorentz boosts involves the Doppler effect and the aberration of light.\n\nYes, the formula for the angle θ in the lab frame (S) in terms of the angle θ' in the rest frame (S') is given by:\n\ntan θ = [sin θ'] / [γ (cos θ' + β)]\n\nwhere β = v/c and γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Wait, but here we need to be careful with the direction of the boost. Since the η' is moving with velocity v in the lab frame, then in the rest frame S', the lab frame S is moving with velocity -v. So if we have a photon emitted at angle θ' in S', then in S, the angle θ would be related by the inverse transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can derive the relation. Let's consider the photon's momentum in S' and then apply a Lorentz boost to get the momentum in S.\n\nIn the rest frame S', the photon has energy E' and momentum p' = E'/c (since for photons, E = pc). The direction of the photon is given by θ', the angle between the photon's momentum and the direction of motion (which is the z-axis, say). Then, when we boost to the lab frame S, moving at velocity v along the z-axis relative to S', we need to find the new momentum components.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum components is:\n\np_x = γ (p'_x + β E'/c²)\n\np_y = γ (p'_y + β E'/c²)\n\np_z = γ (p'_z + β E'/c²)\n\nWait, no, that's for energy and momentum. Let me recall the correct Lorentz transformations. For a boost along the z-axis, the transformations for momentum components are:\n\np_x = γ (p'_x + β E'/c )\n\np_y = γ (p'_y + β E'/c )\n\np_z = γ (p'_z + β E'/c )\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the standard Lorentz transformation for momentum.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum when boosting from frame S' to S with velocity v along the z-axis is:\n\nE = γ (E' + v p'_z c )\n\np_x = p'_x \n\np_y = p'_y \n\np_z = γ (p'_z + v E' / c² )\n\nWait, no, this is when transforming from S' to S. Let me check again.\n\nActually, the correct transformation is:\n\nIf S is moving with velocity v along the z-axis relative to S', then the Lorentz transformations for energy and momentum are:\n\nE = γ (E' + v p'_z )\n\np_x = p'_x \n\np_y = p'_y \n\np_z = γ (p'_z + v E' / c² )\n\nBut since we are dealing with a photon, E' = c p', so E' = c |p'|. Let me write p'_z = |p'| cos θ', and similarly p'_x = |p'| sin θ' cos φ', p'_y = |p'| sin θ' sin φ'. But since the decay is isotropic in S', φ' is uniformly distributed, but we can consider the distribution in θ' and φ', but since we are looking for the distribution in θ (the angle in the lab frame), maybe we can integrate over φ'? Wait, but the problem says the decay is isotropic in the rest frame, so the distribution is uniform in cos θ' and φ'. So in S', the photon is emitted with uniform distribution in solid angle.\n\nBut when we boost to the lab frame, the distribution will not be uniform anymore. The question is to find W(θ) d cos θ, which is the normalized probability in the lab frame.\n\nTo find W(θ), we need to find how the differential solid angle in S' transforms into the differential solid angle in S. Since the decay is isotropic in S', the probability distribution is uniform in dΩ' = sin θ' dθ' dφ', so the probability is proportional to dΩ'. Therefore, in the lab frame, we need to express dΩ' in terms of dΩ, and then find the corresponding distribution.\n\nAlternatively, since we need W(θ) d cos θ, which is the probability distribution in terms of cos θ, we can use the relation between d cos θ and d cos θ', and the Jacobian of the transformation.\n\nLet me think. Let me denote the angle in the rest frame as θ', and in the lab frame as θ. Since the decay is isotropic in the rest frame, the probability distribution in terms of θ' is uniform in cos θ', so dP ∝ d cos θ'. Therefore, in the lab frame, we need to find dP ∝ d cos θ', but expressed in terms of d cos θ. Therefore, we need to find the Jacobian determinant of the transformation from θ' to θ, so that d cos θ' = |dθ'/dθ| d cos θ. Therefore, W(θ) would be proportional to |dθ'/dθ|.\n\nBut how to find the relation between θ and θ'? Let me derive that.\n\nLet me use the Lorentz transformation for the momentum. Let me consider that in the rest frame S', the photon has momentum p' with components:\n\np'_z = (E'/c) cos θ'\n\np'_x = (E'/c) sin θ' cos φ'\n\np'_y = (E'/c) sin θ' sin φ'\n\nBut since the decay is isotropic, φ' is uniformly distributed. However, since we are looking for the distribution in θ (angle in lab frame), and the problem says that the decay is isotropic in the rest frame, maybe we can consider integrating over φ', but since the boost is along the z-axis, the azimuthal angle φ' might not affect the transformation of θ. Let me check.\n\nIn the lab frame, after the boost, the momentum components will be:\n\nE = γ (E' + v p'_z )\n\np_z = γ (p'_z + v E' / c² )\n\nBut since E' = c p', because it's a photon, we can write E' = c |p'|, and p'_z = |p'| cos θ'.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nE = γ (c |p'| + v |p'| cos θ' )\n\n= γ |p'| (c + v cos θ' )\n\nSimilarly, p_z = γ ( |p'| cos θ' + v (c |p'| ) / c² )\n\n= γ |p'| [ cos θ' + v / c ]\n\n= γ |p'| [ cos θ' + β ] where β = v/c.\n\nSimilarly, the transverse components p_x and p_y remain the same (assuming the boost is along z-axis). Wait, no, actually, the standard Lorentz transformation for momentum when boosting along z-axis is:\n\np_x = p'_x \n\np_y = p'_y \n\np_z = γ (p'_z + β E' / c )\n\nWait, let me check again. The Lorentz transformation for momentum is:\n\nFor a boost along z-axis with velocity v:\n\np_x = γ (p'_x + β E'_z / c )\n\nWait, no. The general formula for Lorentz transformation of momentum is:\n\nLet me recall that the Lorentz transformation for energy and momentum is:\n\nE = γ (E' + β c p'_z )\n\np_z = γ (p'_z + β E' / c )\n\np_x = p'_x \n\np_y = p'_y \n\nYes, this is correct. So, for a boost along the z-axis with velocity v = β c.\n\nSince for a photon, E' = c |p'|, so substituting:\n\nE = γ [ E' + β c p'_z ] = γ [ c |p'| + β c p'_z ] = γ c |p'| [ 1 + β (p'_z / |p'| ) ] = γ c |p'| [ 1 + β cos θ' ]\n\nSimilarly, p_z = γ [ p'_z + β E' / c ] = γ [ p'_z + β c |p'| / c ] = γ [ p'_z + β |p'| ] = γ |p'| [ (p'_z / |p'| ) + β ] = γ |p'| [ cos θ' + β ]\n\nSo, p_z = γ |p'| ( cos θ' + β )\n\nSimilarly, the transverse components p_x and p_y are p'_x and p'_y, which are p'_x = |p'| sin θ' cos φ', p'_y = |p'| sin θ' sin φ'.\n\nNow, in the lab frame, the direction of the photon is given by the angle θ between the photon's momentum and the z-axis. Therefore, tan θ = sqrt( (p_x^2 + p_y^2) ) / p_z.\n\nBut since p_x = p'_x = |p'| sin θ' cos φ', p_y = p'_y = |p'| sin θ' sin φ', so sqrt(p_x^2 + p_y^2) = |p'| sin θ'.\n\nTherefore, tan θ = [ |p'| sin θ' ] / [ γ |p'| ( cos θ' + β ) ] = [ sin θ' ] / [ γ ( cos θ' + β ) ]\n\nSo tan θ = [ sin θ' ] / [ γ ( cos θ' + β ) ]\n\nThis is the relation between θ and θ'. Now, we need to find how d cos θ relates to d cos θ'.\n\nSince the probability distribution in the rest frame is uniform in cos θ', i.e., dP ∝ d cos θ', then in the lab frame, the distribution would be dP ∝ d cos θ' / d cos θ. Therefore, W(θ) = dP/d(cos θ) = (d cos θ' / d cos θ)^{-1} times the original distribution, but since it's normalized, we need to calculate the Jacobian.\n\nAlternatively, since the original distribution is uniform in cos θ', W(θ) d cos θ = (d cos θ') / (d cos θ) d cos θ. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of probability.\n\nLet me denote that in the rest frame, the probability distribution is dP = (1/(4π)) dΩ' = (1/(4π)) sin θ' dθ' dφ'. Since the decay is isotropic. But since we are integrating over φ', for the distribution in θ (without φ dependence), we can integrate over φ', giving 2π sin θ' dθ' / 4π = (1/2) sin θ' dθ'. Therefore, the distribution in cos θ' is dP = (1/2) d cos θ'.\n\nTherefore, in the lab frame, we need to express dP as a function of θ. Since θ and θ' are related by the equation above, we can write dP = (1/2) d cos θ' = (1/2) [d cos θ' / d cos θ] d cos θ. Therefore, W(θ) = (1/2) [d cos θ' / d cos θ]. Wait, no, if dP = (1/2) d cos θ', then W(θ) d cos θ = dP = (1/2) d cos θ', so W(θ) = (1/2) [d cos θ' / d cos θ]. Therefore, W(θ) = (1/2) |d cos θ' / d cos θ|^{-1}? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me recall that if we have a variable transformation from x to y, then the probability distribution transforms as P(y) dy = P(x) dx, so P(y) = P(x) |dx/dy|. In our case, the original distribution is P(cos θ') d cos θ' = (1/2) d cos θ', so P(cos θ') = 1/2. When changing variables from cos θ' to cos θ, we have d cos θ' = (d cos θ' / d cos θ) d cos θ. Therefore, P(cos θ) d cos θ = P(cos θ') d cos θ' = (1/2) (d cos θ' / d cos θ) d cos θ. Therefore, P(cos θ) = (1/2) (d cos θ' / d cos θ). Therefore, W(θ) = (1/2) (d cos θ' / d cos θ).\n\nSo, I need to compute d cos θ' / d cos θ. Let me first express cos θ in terms of cos θ', or vice versa.\n\nWe have tan θ = [ sin θ' ] / [ γ ( cos θ' + β ) ]\n\nLet me try to express cos θ in terms of θ'. Let me recall that tan θ = sin θ / cos θ. Let me write tan θ = [ sin θ' ] / [ γ ( cos θ' + β ) ].\n\nLet me denote β = v/c as before. Let me also note that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²).\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\ntan²θ = [ sin²θ' ] / [ γ² ( cos θ' + β )² ]\n\nBut tan²θ = (sin²θ)/(cos²θ) = [1 - cos²θ]/cos²θ = 1/cos²θ - 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express cos θ in terms of θ'. Let me consider:\n\nFrom tan θ = sin θ' / [ γ ( cos θ' + β ) ]\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin θ / cos θ = sin θ' / [ γ ( cos θ' + β ) ]\n\nCross multiplying:\n\nsin θ * γ ( cos θ' + β ) = sin θ' cos θ\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe express cos θ in terms of θ'?\n\nAlternatively, let me use the identity:\n\ncos θ = 1 / sqrt(1 + tan²θ )\n\nTherefore:\n\ncos θ = 1 / sqrt( 1 + [ sin²θ' / ( γ² ( cos θ' + β )² ) ] )\n\n= 1 / sqrt( [ γ² ( cos θ' + β )² + sin²θ' ] / [ γ² ( cos θ' + β )² ] )\n\n= γ ( cos θ' + β ) / sqrt( γ² ( cos θ' + β )² + sin²θ' )\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\nγ² ( cos θ' + β )² + sin²θ'\n\nExpand this:\n\nγ² ( cos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + β² ) + 1 - cos²θ'\n\nLet me note that γ² = 1 / (1 - β²). Therefore:\n\n= [1 / (1 - β²)] ( cos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + β² ) + 1 - cos²θ'\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n[ cos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + β² ] / (1 - β² )\n\nSecond term:\n\n+ 1 - cos²θ'\n\nLet me combine them:\n\nLet me write 1 - cos²θ' as (1 - cos²θ') * [ (1 - β²) / (1 - β²) ) ] to have the same denominator.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst term: [ cos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + β² ] / (1 - β² )\n\nSecond term: [ (1 - cos²θ')(1 - β²) ] / (1 - β² )\n\nTherefore, the total denominator becomes:\n\n[ cos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + β² + (1 - cos²θ')(1 - β²) ] / (1 - β² )\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\ncos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + β² + (1 - cos²θ')(1 - β²)\n\nExpand the last term:\n\n(1)(1 - β²) - cos²θ'(1 - β²)\n\nSo total numerator:\n\ncos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + β² + 1 - β² - cos²θ' + cos²θ' β²\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\ncos²θ' cancels with -cos²θ'?\n\nWait:\n\nFirst term: cos²θ'\n\nThen + 2 β cos θ'\n\n+ β² \n\n+ 1 - β² \n\n- cos²θ'(1 - β²) ?\n\nWait no, expanding (1 - cos²θ')(1 - β²) is 1*(1 - β²) - cos²θ'*(1 - β²). Therefore:\n\nSo:\n\ncos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + β² + 1 - β² - cos²θ' + cos²θ' β²\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\ncos²θ' - cos²θ' + cos²θ' β² = cos²θ' β²\n\nThen 2 β cos θ'\n\nThen β² - β² = 0\n\nThen +1 \n\nTherefore total numerator is:\n\ncos²θ' β² + 2 β cos θ' + 1 \n\nSo the denominator is [ cos²θ' β² + 2 β cos θ' + 1 ] / (1 - β² )\n\nTherefore, going back to the expression for cos θ:\n\ncos θ = γ ( cos θ' + β ) / sqrt( [ cos²θ' β² + 2 β cos θ' + 1 ] / (1 - β² ) )\n\n= γ ( cos θ' + β ) * sqrt(1 - β² ) / sqrt( cos²θ' β² + 2 β cos θ' + 1 )\n\nBut γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β² ), so:\n\ncos θ = [ ( cos θ' + β ) / sqrt(1 - β² ) ] * sqrt(1 - β² ) / sqrt( cos²θ' β² + 2 β cos θ' + 1 )\n\nSimplifies to:\n\ncos θ = ( cos θ' + β ) / sqrt( cos²θ' β² + 2 β cos θ' + 1 )\n\nNow, let me compute the denominator:\n\ncos²θ' β² + 2 β cos θ' + 1 \n\nLet me write this as:\n\nβ² cos²θ' + 2 β cos θ' + 1 \n\nThis is a quadratic in cos θ':\n\nLet me denote x = cos θ', then denominator is β² x² + 2 β x + 1.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nβ² x² + 2 β x + 1 = (β x + 1)^2 - something? Let me check:\n\n(β x + 1)^2 = β² x² + 2 β x + 1. Exactly! So denominator is (β x + 1)^2, where x = cos θ'.\n\nTherefore, cos θ = (x + β ) / sqrt( (β x + 1)^2 ) = (x + β ) / |β x + 1|. Since β is positive (velocity is positive), and x = cos θ' which ranges from -1 to 1. However, in the rest frame, the photon is emitted in all directions. But since we are dealing with angles θ' from 0 to π, cos θ' ranges from -1 to 1. However, β is positive (since velocity is positive). Let me check if β x + 1 is positive.\n\nFor β x + 1: since β is between 0 and 1 (assuming v < c, which it is for a particle), and x between -1 and 1. The minimum value of β x + 1 is when x = -1: β*(-1) + 1 = 1 - β > 0 because β < 1. Therefore, β x + 1 is always positive. Therefore, sqrt( (β x + 1)^2 ) = β x + 1. Therefore:\n\ncos θ = (x + β ) / ( β x + 1 )\n\nWhere x = cos θ'. Therefore,\n\ncos θ = ( cos θ' + β ) / ( β cos θ' + 1 )\n\nSo that's a nice relation! Therefore, we have:\n\ncos θ = [ cos θ' + β ] / [ 1 + β cos θ' ]\n\nThis is a standard result for the relativistic aberration of light. Great, so now we have cos θ expressed in terms of cos θ'. Now, we need to find d cos θ' / d cos θ. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me denote y = cos θ and y' = cos θ'. Then:\n\ny = ( y' + β ) / ( 1 + β y' )\n\nLet me solve for y':\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\ny (1 + β y') = y' + β \n\nExpand:\n\ny + β y y' = y' + β \n\nBring terms with y' to one side:\n\nβ y y' - y' = β - y \n\nFactor y':\n\ny' ( β y - 1 ) = β - y \n\nTherefore:\n\ny' = ( β - y ) / ( β y - 1 )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -1:\n\ny' = ( y - β ) / ( 1 - β y )\n\nWhich is the inverse of the original equation, as expected. Because if we take y = [ y' + β ] / [ 1 + β y' ] then solving for y' gives y' = [ y - β ] / [ 1 - β y ].\n\nNow, we need to compute dy'/dy, which is d cos θ' / d cos θ. Let me compute derivative of y' with respect to y:\n\nGiven y' = ( β - y ) / ( β y - 1 )\n\nWait, no, from above, y' = ( y - β ) / ( 1 - β y )\n\nLet me write y' = [ y - β ] / [ 1 - β y ]\n\nCompute derivative dy'/dy:\n\nUsing quotient rule:\n\nLet me denote numerator u = y - β, denominator v = 1 - β y.\n\nThen dy'/dy = (u' v - u v') / v²\n\nu' = 1\n\nv' = - β\n\nTherefore:\n\ndy'/dy = [1*(1 - β y) - (y - β)(-β) ] / (1 - β y)^2\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(1 - β y) + β (y - β )\n\n= 1 - β y + β y - β² \n\n= 1 - β² \n\nTherefore, dy'/dy = (1 - β² ) / (1 - β y )² \n\nTherefore, d cos θ' / d cos θ = (1 - β² ) / (1 - β y )² = (1 - β² ) / (1 - β cos θ )² \n\nTherefore, since W(θ) = (1/2) * [ d cos θ' / d cos θ ]^{-1} ?\n\nWait, earlier I had:\n\nW(θ) d cos θ = (1/2) d cos θ'\n\nTherefore, W(θ) = (1/2) * [ d cos θ' / d cos θ ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier conclusion was:\n\nSince dP = (1/2) d cos θ', and dP = W(θ) d cos θ, then:\n\nW(θ) d cos θ = (1/2) d cos θ'\n\nTherefore, W(θ) = (1/2) * (d cos θ' / d cos θ )\n\nBut we just found that d cos θ' / d cos θ = (1 - β² ) / (1 - β cos θ )² \n\nTherefore:\n\nW(θ) = (1/2) * [ (1 - β² ) / (1 - β cos θ )² ]\n\nBut we need to check the direction of the derivative. Wait, since we derived dy'/dy = (1 - β² ) / (1 - β y )², so d cos θ' / d cos θ = (1 - β² ) / (1 - β cos θ )². Therefore:\n\nW(θ) = (1/2) * [ (1 - β² ) / (1 - β cos θ )² ]\n\nBut we need to check if this is correct. Let me verify dimensions. Since W(θ) is a normalized probability distribution, integrating over cos θ from -1 to 1 should give 1. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nBut first, let me note that β = v/c. However, in the problem statement, the meson η' is moving with velocity v in the lab frame. The problem says \"velocity v\", but in particle physics, usually velocities are non-relativistic unless specified, but since we are dealing with relativistic effects here, probably v is relativistic. However, since we derived the expression in terms of β = v/c, it's okay.\n\nBut let me check the normalization. Let me compute ∫ W(θ) d cos θ from -1 to 1. If the original distribution was uniform in cos θ', then after transformation, it should still integrate to 1. Let me check:\n\n∫_{-1}^1 W(θ) d cos θ = (1/2)(1 - β² ) ∫_{-1}^1 [ 1 / (1 - β cos θ )² ] d cos θ \n\nBut does this equal 1? Let me compute the integral. However, this seems non-trivial. Alternatively, since we know that dP = (1/2) d cos θ' and dP = W(θ) d cos θ, then ∫ W(θ) d cos θ = ∫ (1/2) d cos θ' = (1/2)(2) = 1, since cos θ' ranges from -1 to 1, so d cos θ' integrates to 2. Wait, no:\n\nWait, original distribution is uniform in cos θ', so ∫ W(θ) d cos θ = ∫ (1/2) d cos θ' = (1/2) * [cos θ']_{-1}^1? Wait no, the integral of d cos θ' from -1 to 1 is 2, so ∫ W(θ) d cos θ = (1/2)*2 = 1. Therefore, the expression is correct. Therefore, our W(θ) is:\n\nW(θ) = [ (1 - β² ) / 2 ] * [ 1 / (1 - β cos θ )² ]\n\nBut let me check the expression again. Since we had:\n\nW(θ) = (1/2) * [ d cos θ' / d cos θ ] = (1/2) * [ (1 - β² ) / (1 - β cos θ )² ]\n\nYes. Therefore, substituting β = v/c, we can write:\n\nW(θ) = [ (1 - (v²/c² )) / 2 ] * [ 1 / (1 - (v/c) cos θ )² ]\n\nBut the problem says to express the answer in terms of given quantities. The problem states that the η' meson has mass M, and the ρ⁰ meson has mass m. However, in our derivation, we didn't use the masses. Wait, why? Because we assumed that the photon's energy and momentum are related by E = c p, which is correct for photons. However, the decay η' → ρ⁰ + γ must satisfy energy and momentum conservation. But since the problem says that the decay is isotropic in the rest frame of η', that implies that in the rest frame, the photon's direction is uniformly distributed. However, does energy and momentum conservation allow such an isotropic distribution?\n\nWait, actually, in reality, the decay η' → ρ⁰ + γ would have specific kinematics. The photon and the ρ⁰ meson must have specific energies and momenta. However, the problem says that the decay is isotropic in the rest frame, so perhaps we are to assume that despite the constraints of energy and momentum conservation, the direction of the photon is uniformly distributed. Maybe this is an approximation or the problem is simplified. Since the problem says \"the decay is isotropic in the rest frame\", we can take that as given, and proceed with the derivation as we did.\n\nTherefore, our result is:\n\nW(θ) = [ (1 - β² ) / 2 ] / [ 1 - β cos θ ]² \n\nBut let me check if there's another factor we might have missed. For example, in some derivations, there is an additional factor due to the Jacobian when transforming from θ' and φ' to θ and φ. However, since we integrated over φ' (as the original distribution is isotropic, and we are looking for the distribution in θ only), we have already accounted for that by considering the relation between d cos θ and d cos θ'.\n\nAlternatively, let me think again. The original distribution in S' is uniform in solid angle, so dP/dΩ' = 1/(4π). When we transform to the lab frame, we need to find dP/dΩ. The relation between dΩ and dΩ' is given by the Jacobian determinant. However, since we are looking for the distribution in cos θ, integrating over φ, we can use the fact that in the lab frame, for a given θ, the distribution might depend on φ, but due to symmetry, it's symmetric around the beam axis, so it's independent of φ. Therefore, integrating over φ, we get:\n\ndP/d(cos θ) = ∫ (dP/dΩ) dφ \n\nBut how does this relate to our previous derivation? Alternatively, since we have already considered the transformation of angles, and the fact that the original distribution is uniform in cos θ', leading to our expression, I think our derivation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final expression for W(θ) is:\n\nW(θ) = [ (1 - β² ) / 2 ] / [ 1 - β cos θ ]² \n\nBut let me check dimensions. Since W(θ) is a probability per d cos θ, it should be dimensionless. All terms here are dimensionless, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me check for specific cases. For example, when β = 0 (i.e., the lab frame is the rest frame), then W(θ) becomes [1 / 2 ] / [1]^2 = 1/2, which is correct because dP/d(cos θ) = 1/2, which integrates to 1 over cos θ from -1 to 1. Correct.\n\nAnother check: when β approaches 1 (ultra-relativistic), what happens? The distribution should become peaked around θ = 0, as expected for relativistic beaming. Let me see: W(θ) ~ [ 0 ] / [ ... ]? Wait, no, when β approaches 1, (1 - β²) approaches 0, but denominator [1 - β cos θ]^2. For angles close to θ = 0, cos θ ≈ 1, so denominator ≈ (1 - β)^2, which for β ≈ 1 is small. Therefore, W(θ) ~ (something small) / (something even smaller squared). Wait, need to think carefully.\n\nLet me take β approaching 1, and consider θ small. Let me set β = 1 - ε, with ε small. Then 1 - β² ≈ 2ε. Let me set θ small, so cos θ ≈ 1 - θ²/2. Then 1 - β cos θ ≈ 1 - (1 - ε)(1 - θ²/2) ≈ 1 - [1 - θ²/2 - ε + ε θ²/2 ] ≈ θ²/2 + ε - (ε θ²)/2 ≈ ε + θ²/2. Therefore, denominator [1 - β cos θ]^2 ≈ (ε + θ²/2)^2. Therefore, W(θ) ≈ [ 2 ε / 2 ] / (ε + θ²/2 )² = ε / (ε + θ²/2 )². If we fix θ and take ε → 0, then W(θ) tends to zero except when θ is scaled with ε. This suggests a delta function behavior at θ = 0, which is consistent with relativistic beaming. Therefore, our expression seems to behave correctly in the ultra-relativistic limit.\n\nTherefore, I think our result is correct. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nW(θ) = \\frac{1 - \\beta^2}{2 (1 - \\beta \\cos \\theta)^2}\n\nBut since β = v/c, and the problem uses velocity v, we can write it in terms of v and c. However, the problem didn't specify whether to express in terms of β or keep it as v/c. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"velocity v\", so unless there is a need to express in terms of M and m, but in our derivation, we didn't use the masses. Wait, why?\n\nBecause the problem says that the decay is isotropic in the rest frame. However, in reality, the photon's energy and direction in the rest frame are determined by the kinematics of the decay. For example, in the rest frame of η', the photon and the ρ⁰ meson must share the available energy and momentum. However, the problem says the decay is isotropic, which might be an approximation or the problem is assuming that despite the kinematics, the direction is uniform. Since the problem says so, we don't need to calculate the actual distribution from energy-momentum conservation. Therefore, our result is acceptable as per the problem's statement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nW(θ) = \\frac{1 - \\beta^2}{2 (1 - \\beta \\cos \\theta)^2} where β = v/c.\n\nBut the problem might want it expressed in terms of v, so:\n\nW(θ) = \\frac{1 - (v^2/c^2)}{2 [1 - (v/c) \\cos \\theta]^2}\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions the masses M and m, but they didn't ask for anything related to them in the answer, unless there's something missing here. Wait, maybe I need to check if the photon's energy in the rest frame affects the angle transformation? For example, in our derivation, we used that E' = c p', which is true for photons. But in reality, the photon's energy in the rest frame is fixed by the decay kinematics. However, since the problem says the decay is isotropic, meaning that for all directions θ', the photon is emitted with that direction, which would require that the photon's energy is the same in all directions? Which is not possible unless the decay is symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. In reality, for a two-body decay, the decay products have fixed energies and directions in the rest frame. For example, in the rest frame of η', the ρ⁰ and the photon must have equal and opposite momenta. Therefore, the photon's direction is uniquely determined once the direction of the ρ⁰ is chosen. However, if the decay is isotropic, that would imply that the ρ⁰ is emitted isotropically, which is not the case in reality for two-body decays. In reality, for a two-body decay in the rest frame, the decay products are emitted back-to-back with fixed magnitudes of momentum. Therefore, the angle θ' of the photon is uniquely determined by the direction of the ρ⁰, which for an isotropic decay would require that the ρ⁰ is emitted isotropically, which is not possible in a two-body decay. Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the decay is isotropic in the rest frame of η'\". How is this possible? For a two-body decay, the direction of the decay products is not isotropic. The decay products are emitted in opposite directions with fixed magnitude of momentum. Therefore, the photon's direction is uniquely determined by the direction of the ρ⁰ meson. Therefore, if the ρ⁰ is emitted isotropically, which is impossible in a two-body decay, then the photon would also be emitted isotropically. But in reality, for a two-body decay, the angular distribution is not isotropic. Therefore, the problem is assuming an isotropic distribution for some reason, maybe it's a three-body decay or something else? Or perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario.\n\nGiven that the problem says the decay is isotropic in the rest frame, we have to take that as a given condition, even if it's non-physical. Therefore, proceed with the derivation as we did. Therefore, our result is acceptable under the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nW(θ) = \\frac{1 - (v^2/c^2)}{2 [1 - (v/c) \\cos \\theta]^2}\n\nBut let me check units again. Since W(θ) is a normalized probability per d cos θ, it's dimensionless. All terms are dimensionless, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might want the answer expressed in terms of γ. Since 1 - β² = 1/γ². Therefore:\n\nW(θ) = \\frac{1}{2 γ² [1 - β \\cos θ]^2 }\n\nBut maybe they want it in terms of γ and β. However, the problem didn't specify, so probably expressing in terms of v and c is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. For example, using the fact that in the rest frame, the distribution is uniform in cos θ', so dP/d cos θ' = 1/2. Then using the relation between cos θ and cos θ', we can write:\n\ndP/d cos θ = dP/d cos θ' * |d cos θ'/d cos θ| \n\nWhich is the same as before. Therefore, same result.\n\nTherefore, I think our answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe normalized probability distribution is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1 - \\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}{2\\left(1 - \\dfrac{v}{c} \\cos \\theta\\right)^2}}.\n</think>"}
