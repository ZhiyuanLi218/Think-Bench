It is based on several key assumptions:\n\n- **Option A** is correct: The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature. This is a central postulate of the theory, mathematically expressed as $ KE_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{3}{2}kT $, where $ k $ is Boltzmann’s constant and $ T $ is the absolute temperature.\n\n- **Option B** is correct: Ideal gas particles are assumed to have no intermolecular forces (no attraction or repulsion) except during collisions. This simplification allows gases to follow the ideal gas law under all conditions.\n\n- **Option C** is correct: The theory assumes gas particles are point masses with negligible volume compared to the container. This means the volume of individual particles is considered insignificant.\n\nSince all three statements (A, B, and C) are fundamental to the kinetic-molecular theory of gases, **Option D is the correct answer**.\n\n**Answer:** D: (A), (B), and (C) are part of the theory.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about the kinetic-molecular theory of gases and which statements are part of it. The options are A, B, C, and D which says all three are part of the theory.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the postulates of the kinetic-molecular theory. From what I remember, the theory has several key points. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says the average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly related to the Kelvin temperature. I think that's correct. The theory states that the average kinetic energy is proportional to the absolute temperature (in Kelvin). The formula I remember is something like KE_avg = (3/2)kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant. So A is part of the theory.\n\nOption B states that ideal gas particles do not attract or repel each other. Yes, that's one of the main assumptions. In the ideal gas model, there are no intermolecular forces except during collisions. So B is correct.\n\nOption C claims that the atoms or molecules of an ideal gas have no volume. Another key assumption. The theory assumes that gas particles are point masses with negligible volume compared to the container. So C is also part of the theory.\n\nTherefore, all three statements A, B, and C are part of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases. That would make option D the correct answer.\n</think>"}
