This is governed by **Newton's First Law**, which states that if the net force acting on an object is zero, the object will remain at rest or in uniform motion. Since static equilibrium specifically refers to an object at rest, the **vector sum of all forces must be zero**:\n\n$$\n\\sum \\vec{F} = 0\n$$\n\nThis ensures that the object does not accelerate in any direction.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Rotational Equilibrium (Condition I):**  \nEven if the net force is zero, the object could still rotate if there is a net torque acting on it. For example, two equal and opposite forces applied at different points can produce a torque, causing rotation. To prevent rotation, the **vector sum of all torques must also be zero**:\n\n$$\n\\sum \\vec{\\tau} = 0\n$$\n\nThis ensures that the object does not rotate or change its angular motion.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Energy Consideration (Condition III):**  \nThe condition that the **sum of potential and kinetic energy must be zero** is **not a requirement** for static equilibrium. In static equilibrium, the object is at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero, but its potential energy is not necessarily zero. For example, a book resting on a table has gravitational potential energy, but it is in static equilibrium. The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is not a factor in determining whether the object is in equilibrium.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOnly conditions **I (net torque = 0)** and **II (net force = 0)** are necessary for static equilibrium. Condition III is not required.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{D: I and II only}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which conditions are necessary for an object to be in static equilibrium. The options are I, II, and III, and the answer choices are combinations of these. Let me start by recalling what static equilibrium means.\n\nFrom what I remember, static equilibrium refers to a situation where an object is at rest and remains at rest. That means there's no acceleration, either linear or rotational. So, in terms of physics, Newton's laws would apply here. \n\nFirst, for linear motion, Newton's first law says that if the net force on an object is zero, it will remain at rest or move with constant velocity. Since static equilibrium specifically means the object is at rest, the net force must be zero. So that would relate to condition II: the vector sum of all forces on the object must equal zero. That seems straightforward. So II is probably a necessary condition.\n\nThen there's rotational motion. Even if the net force is zero, if there's a net torque, the object could still rotate. For example, imagine two equal and opposite forces applied at different points on an object, creating a torque. The object might spin even though the net force is zero. Therefore, for static equilibrium, not only must the net force be zero, but the net torque must also be zero. That would correspond to condition I: the vector sum of all torques must equal zero. So I is also a necessary condition.\n\nNow, condition III says the sum of the object's potential and kinetic energies must be zero. Hmm. Let me think. In static equilibrium, the object is at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. But potential energy depends on the position or configuration of the object. For example, a book on a table has gravitational potential energy, but it's in static equilibrium. The sum of potential and kinetic energy would just be the potential energy, which isn't necessarily zero. So III doesn't seem to be a necessary condition. The total mechanical energy doesn't have to be zero for static equilibrium. So III is probably not correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, I and II are necessary conditions, while III is not. Therefore, the correct answer should be D: I and II only.\n\nWait, let me just verify with some examples. If I have a book sitting on a table, the forces are balanced (gravity down, normal force up), so net force is zero. There's no torque because the forces act through the center of mass, so net torque is also zero. The kinetic energy is zero, but potential energy isn't. So that's static equilibrium with non-zero potential energy. So III is not necessary. Another example: a rod hanging from two strings. As long as the forces and torques balance, it's in equilibrium regardless of its potential energy. So yeah, III is out. So answer D makes sense.\n</think>"}
