So, the problem is about testing the effectiveness of sacrificial anode cathodic protection using a galvanized iron sheet in an acidified 3% NaCl solution. The question is asking which result would indicate that the iron sheet has not been corroded. The options are about different chemical tests and their outcomes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what sacrificial anode cathodic protection involves. Sacrificial anodes are made of a metal that is more reactive (more electropositive) than iron, such as zinc. In this case, the iron sheet is galvanized, meaning it's coated with zinc. If the coating is damaged, the zinc (which is more reactive) should act as the anode and corrode instead of the iron. So, if the protection is working, the iron should not corrode, and the zinc is the one that corrodes.\n\nNow, the experiment is to place the damaged galvanized iron sheet into an acidified NaCl solution. After some time, they test the solution for certain results. The options involve adding different reagents and observing the outcomes.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\n(A) Adding AgNO3 solution produces a precipitate. AgNO3 is used to test for chloride ions. Since the solution is 3% NaCl, adding AgNO3 would form AgCl precipitate regardless of whether the iron has corroded. So, this result would be expected even if corrosion occurred. Therefore, the presence of a precipitate doesn't necessarily indicate whether iron has corroded. So maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\n(B) Adding starch-potassium iodide solution produces no blue color. Starch-iodide solution is used to test for oxidizing agents. If there's a blue color, it means that iodide ions have been oxidized to iodine, which then forms a complex with starch. If the solution turns blue, that would indicate the presence of an oxidizing agent. In the context of iron corrosion, if iron is corroding, it might release Fe²+ or Fe³+ ions. But how does that relate to starch-iodide? Maybe if there are oxidizing agents in the solution, like Fe³+ ions, which can oxidize I^- to I2. If the iron is corroded and Fe³+ is present, then adding KI would produce I2, which gives a blue color with starch. So if there's no blue color, that might indicate no Fe³+ ions, implying no corrosion. So this could be a possible answer.\n\n(C) Adding KCNS solution produces no red color. KCNS (potassium thiocyanate) is used to test for Fe³+ ions. When Fe³+ is present, it forms a blood-red complex with thiocyanate. So if there's no red color, that suggests no Fe³+ ions in solution, which would imply that the iron hasn't corroded. So this is another possible answer.\n\n(D) Adding K3[Fe(CN)6] solution produces no blue color. Potassium ferricyanide is used to test for Fe²+ ions. When Fe²+ is present, it reacts with K3[Fe(CN)6] to form a dark blue precipitate called Prussian blue. If there's no blue color, that suggests no Fe²+ ions, which would also indicate that the iron hasn't corroded. So this is another possible answer.\n\nNow, the question is which of these results would indicate that the iron sheet has not been corroded. So, the key is to figure out what each test is detecting. \n\nIf the iron is corroded, it would typically produce Fe²+ ions (as in rusting, which involves Fe²+ and Fe³+). The sacrificial anode (zinc) corrodes instead, producing Zn²+ ions. So if the iron is protected, then Fe²+ or Fe³+ ions wouldn't be present in the solution, but Zn²+ would be. However, the tests are for Fe²+ or Fe³+.\n\nLet me go back to each option:\n\nOption B: Starch-iodide solution. If Fe³+ is present, it can oxidize I^- to I2, which turns the starch solution blue. If there's no blue color, that means no Fe³+ is present, so the iron hasn't corroded. But if the iron is protected, then Fe³+ wouldn't be present. So B could be correct.\n\nOption C: KCNS (thiocyanate) test. If Fe³+ is present, red color. No red color implies no Fe³+.\n\nOption D: K3[Fe(CN)6] for Fe²+; no blue color implies no Fe²+.\n\nSo both B, C, D could be possible. But the question is which one is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is about what the solution contains. The solution is acidified 3% NaCl. If the iron is corroded, it would release Fe²+ or Fe³+ into the solution. However, if the zinc is the one corroding, then Zn²+ would be present. The tests are for Fe²+ or Fe³+.\n\nBut let's think about the actual reactions. In the acidified NaCl solution, the environment is corrosive. Normally, iron would corrode. But with a sacrificial anode (zinc), the zinc should oxidize instead of iron. So, the solution would have Zn²+ ions instead of Fe²+/Fe³+.\n\nSo if the iron is not corroded, then Fe²+ and Fe³+ should not be present. Therefore, the tests for those ions (options B, C, D) would be negative. But which of these is the correct test?\n\nOption C: Thiocyanate with Fe³+ gives red. If no red color, then no Fe³+.\n\nOption D: K3[Fe(CN)6] with Fe²+ gives blue. If no blue, no Fe²+.\n\nOption B: Starch-iodide: Fe³+ can oxidize iodide to I2. If no blue color, then no Fe³+.\n\nSo if both Fe²+ and Fe³+ are absent, then both C and D would show no color. But perhaps the question is about which of the options would indicate that.\n\nBut in the case of iron corrosion, it's possible that Fe²+ is the primary ion produced, which might later oxidize to Fe³+. However, in the presence of acid and chloride, the corrosion products might be different. But in general, if the iron is protected, neither Fe²+ nor Fe³+ would be present.\n\nBut the options are separate. So which one is the correct answer? Let's check the options again.\n\nThe question is which result would indicate that the iron sheet has not been corroded.\n\nIf the iron is not corroded, then there should be no Fe²+ or Fe³+ ions in the solution. Therefore:\n\n- Option C: Adding KCNS (which detects Fe³+) produces no red color. So if there's no Fe³+, that's a good sign.\n\n- Option D: Adding K3[Fe(CN)6] (which detects Fe²+) produces no blue color. So if there's no Fe²+, that's also a good sign.\n\n- Option B: No blue color with starch-iodide implies no Fe³+.\n\nBut in the solution, if the iron is corroded, it might produce Fe²+ first. Fe²+ can be oxidized to Fe³+ in the presence of oxygen, but depending on the environment. Since the solution is acidified, perhaps Fe²+ is more stable? Or maybe the solution is under acidic conditions, so Fe³+ might not be present as much. Wait, in acidic conditions, Fe²+ can be oxidized to Fe³+ if there's an oxidizing agent. But in the presence of Cl^- and acid, maybe the main ions would be Fe²+?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the corrosion of iron in acidic solution, the primary product is Fe²+.\n\nBut regardless, the key is that the presence of Fe²+ or Fe³+ would indicate corrosion. So if the tests for these ions are negative, then the iron is not corroded.\n\nBut the question is which of the options is correct. Let's think about what each test is actually detecting.\n\nOption D: K3[Fe(CN)6] (ferricyanide) reacts with Fe²+ to form Prussian blue. The reaction is:\n\nFe²+ + K3[Fe(CN)6] → KFe[Fe(CN)6] (Prussian blue)\n\nSo if there's no blue color, that means no Fe²+.\n\nOption C: Fe³+ + SCN^- → [Fe(SCN)]^2+ (red color). So no red color means no Fe³+.\n\nOption B: Fe³+ can oxidize I^- to I2. The starch-iodide test is for oxidizing agents. If Fe³+ is present, it would oxidize I^- to I2, which turns the solution blue. If no blue color, then no Fe³+.\n\nSo if the iron is not corroded, then there would be no Fe²+ or Fe³+. Therefore, both options C and D would show negative results. However, the options are separate, so which one is the correct answer? Let's check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\n(A) AgNO3 precipitate (always present due to Cl-)\n\n(B) Starch-KI no blue (no Fe³+)\n\n(C) KCNS no red (no Fe³+)\n\n(D) K3[Fe(CN)6] no blue (no Fe²+)\n\nSo if the iron is not corroded, both Fe²+ and Fe³+ would be absent. Therefore, both C and D would be correct. But since it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer, perhaps there's something I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the specific test that indicates the absence of iron corrosion. Let me think again about the actual process.\n\nIn the sacrificial anode protection, the zinc is oxidized instead of iron. The reactions would be:\n\nAt the anode (zinc): Zn → Zn²+ + 2e^-\n\nAt the cathode (iron): 2H+ + 2e^- → H2 (since it's in acidic solution), or maybe O2 reduction if oxygen is present, but since it's acidified, maybe H+ is the main one.\n\nSo the solution would have Zn²+ ions, but not Fe²+ or Fe³+. Therefore, if the iron is protected, there should be no Fe²+ or Fe³+.\n\nSo tests for Fe²+ (option D) and Fe³+ (options B and C) should be negative.\n\nBut the options are separate. So why are there multiple options? The question is from a test, so likely only one is correct. Let me check standard tests for iron corrosion.\n\nIn standard qualitative analysis, the presence of Fe²+ is tested with potassium ferricyanide (option D) which gives a blue precipitate. The presence of Fe³+ is tested with potassium thiocyanate (option C) which gives a red color. The starch-iodide test (option B) is for oxidizing agents, which Fe³+ can act as.\n\nSo if the iron has not corroded, then neither Fe²+ nor Fe³+ would be present. Therefore, all three tests (B, C, D) would show negative results. But the options are presented as separate choices. However, in the given options, only one is correct. So perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are (A) through (D). The question is asking which result would indicate that the iron sheet has not been corroded. So, which of these options, if observed, would indicate no corrosion.\n\nLet me think about what each test is detecting:\n\n- Option B: No blue color with starch-iodide implies no Fe³+.\n\n- Option C: No red color with KCNS implies no Fe³+.\n\n- Option D: No blue color with K3[Fe(CN)6] implies no Fe²+.\n\nIf the iron is not corroded, then both Fe²+ and Fe³+ are absent. So all three tests (B, C, D) would be negative. However, in a real test scenario, maybe only one of these is considered. But why are they all options here?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about which test specifically detects iron corrosion. For example, if the iron is corroded, it would produce Fe²+ ions. If the solution is tested for Fe²+ (option D), a blue color would indicate corrosion. Therefore, no blue color would indicate no corrosion. Similarly, if Fe³+ is present (option B or C), that would indicate corrosion. But in reality, in an acidified solution, Fe²+ might be more likely to be present than Fe³+ because Fe³+ in acidic solution can hydrolyze to form various species, but if the solution is kept acidic, maybe Fe²+ is more stable. However, in the presence of oxygen, Fe²+ can be oxidized to Fe³+.\n\nBut the question says the solution is acidified. If the solution is kept in an oxygen-free environment, maybe Fe²+ remains. But in practice, it's hard to prevent oxygen from being present. So maybe both Fe²+ and Fe³+ could be present if corrosion occurs.\n\nBut regardless, the question is about which result indicates no corrosion. Let's consider that if the iron is protected, then there is no Fe²+ or Fe³+ in solution. Therefore, all three tests (B, C, D) would show negative results. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is D.\n\nWait, let's think about the specific reagents. K3[Fe(CN)6] is ferricyanide. When it reacts with Fe²+, it forms Prussian blue. If there is no Fe²+, then no blue. If the iron is corroded, it would produce Fe²+, so a blue color. Therefore, no blue means no corrosion. So option D.\n\nOption C: If Fe³+ is present, it would react with KCNS to form red color. If no red color, no Fe³+.\n\nOption B: If Fe³+ is present, it would oxidize I^- to I2, giving blue with starch. No blue means no Fe³+.\n\nSo both B, C, D could indicate absence of corrosion. However, in the context of the sacrificial anode, the primary product would be Zn²+ ions, not Fe²+ or Fe³+. Therefore, if the iron is protected, there's no Fe²+ or Fe³+.\n\nBut why are there multiple options? Maybe the question is designed to have only one correct answer, and the others are distractors. Let's consider the chemistry of each test.\n\nIn the solution, after the experiment, if the iron has corroded, it would release Fe²+ ions. The presence of Fe²+ can be detected by potassium ferricyanide (option D) giving a blue color. If there is no blue color, it means no Fe²+, so no corrosion. This seems directly related to iron corrosion.\n\nOption C is for Fe³+. If the iron is corroded and Fe²+ is oxidized to Fe³+, then option C would detect it. However, if the corrosion is minimal and Fe³+ isn't present, then option C might not show a color. But in an acidified solution, Fe²+ might be more prevalent.\n\nOption B is for oxidizing agents, which could be Fe³+. Again, if Fe³+ is present, it would cause a blue color. No color means no Fe³+.\n\nSo, perhaps the intended answer is D, because the primary product of iron corrosion in acidic solution is Fe²+, and testing for Fe²+ would be more direct. However, in reality, both Fe²+ and Fe³+ could be present depending on the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is based on the fact that the galvanized iron, when corroded, releases Zn²+ instead of Fe²+. But the tests are for Fe²+ or Fe³+.\n\nWait, but the question is about whether the iron sheet has been corroded. If the zinc is acting as the sacrificial anode, the iron is not corroded, and zinc is. So the solution would have Zn²+ ions. If the iron is not corroded, then Fe²+ and Fe³+ should not be present. Therefore, any test for these ions (B, C, D) would be negative. But the options are separate.\n\nIn the given options, which one is correct? Let's look at standard laboratory tests for iron corrosion.\n\nThe potassium ferricyanide test (option D) is a standard test for Fe²+ ions. If no blue color, then no Fe²+.\n\nThe thiocyanate test (option C) is for Fe³+.\n\nThe starch-iodide test (option B) is for oxidizing agents, which could include Fe³+.\n\nSo if the iron is not corroded, both Fe²+ and Fe³+ are absent, so all three tests would be negative. However, the question must have one correct answer. Perhaps the intended answer is D, because the corrosion of iron would primarily produce Fe²+ ions, and the test for Fe²+ (option D) would be the direct indicator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that if the iron is corroded, the solution would contain Fe²+ ions, which would react with K3[Fe(CN)6] to give a blue color. Therefore, no blue color means no Fe²+ and thus no corrosion. So option D.\n\nBut why isn't option C or B correct? Let's think about the actual reactions. If the iron is corroded, the primary product is Fe²+. In an acidic solution, Fe²+ might not be oxidized to Fe³+ unless there's an oxidizing agent present. Since the solution is acidified, maybe there's no strong oxidizing agent, so Fe²+ remains. Therefore, testing for Fe²+ (option D) would be the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, if the solution contains Cl^- and H+, maybe some Fe³+ is present. But I think the primary product would be Fe²+.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Adding K3[Fe(CN)6] produces no blue color, indicating no Fe²+ and thus no corrosion of the iron.\n\nBut wait, another thought: In the sacrificial anode system, even if the iron is protected, there could be some local corrosion at the damaged site. However, the question states that the iron sheet has not been corroded, so we assume that the zinc is protecting it effectively.\n\nSo the test that directly checks for the presence of iron ions is D. If no blue color, then no Fe²+ means the iron hasn't corroded.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
