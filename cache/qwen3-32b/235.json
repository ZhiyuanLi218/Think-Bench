The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, since the stone is thrown horizontally, its initial vertical velocity is zero. That means the only velocity it has at the start is the horizontal component, which is 30 m/s. But once it's in the air, gravity is going to start affecting it, right? So over time, the stone will accelerate downward due to gravity. The question is asking for the total speed when it hits the water after 4 seconds. Total speed would be the combination of both the horizontal and vertical components of velocity at that time.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the vertical velocity after 4 seconds. Since there's no air resistance, the only acceleration acting on the stone vertically is due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity near the Earth's surface is approximately 9.8 m/s². But maybe for simplicity, they expect me to use 10 m/s²? Let me check the answer options. The options are 30, 40, 50, 60. If I use 10 m/s², calculations might be easier and result in one of these numbers. Maybe that's what they want. Let me proceed with that assumption unless it doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, vertical velocity after time t can be calculated using the equation:\n\nv_y = u_y + a*t\n\nWhere u_y is the initial vertical velocity, which is 0 because it's thrown horizontally. So:\n\nv_y = 0 + (10 m/s²)(4 s) = 40 m/s\n\nSo the vertical component of velocity after 4 seconds is 40 m/s downward.\n\nNow, the horizontal component of velocity remains constant because there's no air resistance (so no horizontal acceleration). Therefore, the horizontal velocity is still 30 m/s after 4 seconds.\n\nTo find the total speed, we need to combine these two perpendicular components (horizontal and vertical) using the Pythagorean theorem. The total speed v is the magnitude of the velocity vector, which is sqrt(v_x² + v_y²).\n\nSo:\n\nv = sqrt( (30 m/s)² + (40 m/s)² )\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(30)^2 = 900\n\n(40)^2 = 1600\n\nAdding them together: 900 + 1600 = 2500\n\nThen the square root of 2500 is 50. So the total speed is 50 m/s. Looking at the options, that's option C.\n\nWait, but hold on, I assumed that the acceleration due to gravity is 10 m/s². If they actually use 9.8 m/s², then the vertical velocity would be 9.8 * 4 = 39.2 m/s. Let's see what that would give us.\n\nv_y = 39.2 m/s\n\nThen total speed is sqrt(30² + 39.2²) = sqrt(900 + 1536.64) = sqrt(2436.64) ≈ 49.36 m/s. That would still be closest to 50 m/s, so option C. So even if they use 9.8, the answer is still C. Therefore, regardless of whether they approximate g as 10 or use 9.8, the answer is C: 50 m/s.\n\nBut let me double-check the problem statement. It says \"assuming that air resistance is negligible.\" So that's correct, we don't have to consider air resistance. The horizontal velocity remains 30 m/s. The vertical velocity is calculated correctly. The time is 4 seconds. So, the key here is understanding that the horizontal and vertical motions are independent, and the total speed is the vector sum.\n\nAnother thing to check: did they ask for speed or velocity? The question says \"total speed,\" which is the magnitude of the velocity vector, so that's correct. If they had asked for velocity, we would have to specify direction, but since it's speed, the scalar quantity, we just need the magnitude. So yes, 50 m/s is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 50 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
