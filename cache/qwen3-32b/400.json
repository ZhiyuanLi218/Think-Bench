Let me recall what a geometric sequence is. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted by r.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the common ratio of this sequence. To do that, I can divide the second term by the first term. Let me write that down:\n\nSecond term / First term = (25/3) / (125/9)\n\nDividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so that becomes (25/3) * (9/125). Let me compute that:\n\nMultiply the numerators: 25 * 9 = 225\n\nMultiply the denominators: 3 * 125 = 375\n\nSo that's 225/375. Let me simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 75. 225 ÷ 75 = 3, and 375 ÷ 75 = 5. So that simplifies to 3/5. Therefore, the common ratio r is 3/5.\n\nWait a second, let me check if this ratio is consistent with the next terms. Let me check the third term divided by the second term. Third term is 5, second term is 25/3.\n\nSo 5 / (25/3) = 5 * (3/25) = 15/25 = 3/5. Okay, same ratio. Let me check the next one. Fourth term is 3, divided by third term 5: 3 / 5 = 3/5. Yep, same ratio. So the common ratio is indeed 3/5.\n\nNow, the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term.\n\nGiven that, we need to find the eighth term, which is a_8. Let me write down the formula:\n\na_8 = a_1 * r^(8-1) = a_1 * r^7\n\nGiven that a_1 is 125/9 and r is 3/5.\n\nSo substituting the values:\n\na_8 = (125/9) * (3/5)^7\n\nNow, I need to compute (3/5)^7 first. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n(3/5)^1 = 3/5\n\n(3/5)^2 = 9/25\n\n(3/5)^3 = 27/125\n\n(3/5)^4 = 81/625\n\n(3/5)^5 = 243/3125\n\n(3/5)^6 = 729/15625\n\n(3/5)^7 = 2187/78125\n\nSo (3/5)^7 = 2187 / 78125.\n\nNow, multiply this by 125/9:\n\na_8 = (125/9) * (2187 / 78125)\n\nLet me compute this multiplication. Let's see if we can simplify before multiplying.\n\nFirst, note that 125 is 5^3 and 78125 is 5^7, since 5^7 = 78125. Let me check that:\n\n5^1 = 5\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n5^3 = 125\n\n5^4 = 625\n\n5^5 = 3125\n\n5^6 = 15625\n\n5^7 = 78125. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, 2187 is 3^7. Let me check:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187. Correct.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\na_8 = (5^3 / 9) * (3^7 / 5^7) = (3^7 / 9) * (5^3 / 5^7) = (3^7 / 3^2) * (5^(3-7)) = 3^(7-2) * 5^(-4) = 3^5 / 5^4\n\nBecause 9 is 3^2, so dividing by 9 is multiplying by 3^(-2). Let me confirm:\n\nOriginal expression: (5^3 / 3^2) * (3^7 / 5^7) = (3^7 / 3^2) * (5^3 / 5^7) = 3^(7-2) * 5^(3-7) = 3^5 * 5^(-4) = 3^5 / 5^4.\n\nYes, that seems right. So simplifying exponents:\n\n3^5 is 243, and 5^4 is 625. Therefore, a_8 = 243 / 625.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recast the original multiplication:\n\n(125 / 9) * (2187 / 78125) = (125 * 2187) / (9 * 78125)\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator separately.\n\nFirst numerator: 125 * 2187\n\nDenominator: 9 * 78125\n\nLet me see if there are common factors here. Let's factor each number:\n\n125 is 5^3.\n\n2187 is 3^7.\n\n9 is 3^2.\n\n78125 is 5^7.\n\nSo numerator is 5^3 * 3^7\n\nDenominator is 3^2 * 5^7\n\nTherefore, simplifying:\n\n(5^3 / 5^7) * (3^7 / 3^2) = 5^(3-7) * 3^(7-2) = 5^(-4) * 3^5 = 3^5 / 5^4 = 243 / 625. Yep, same result. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with actual multiplication in case my exponent rules were off.\n\nLet me compute numerator: 125 * 2187.\n\nWell, 125 * 2187. Let me note that 125 * 2187 = 125 * 2000 + 125 * 187 = 250,000 + 23,375 = 273,375. Wait, let me check that again:\n\nWait 125 * 2187. Alternatively, since 2187 divided by 9 is 243, as we saw before. Wait, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 2187 divided by 9 first?\n\nWait, since the denominator is 9 * 78125. So if I take numerator / denominator:\n\n(125 * 2187) / (9 * 78125) = (125 / 78125) * (2187 / 9)\n\nCompute 125 / 78125 first. Since 78125 / 125 = 625. Because 125 * 625 = 78125. Let me check 125 * 600 = 75,000, 125 * 25 = 3,125. 75,000 + 3,125 = 78,125. Yes. Therefore, 125 / 78125 = 1 / 625.\n\nSimilarly, 2187 / 9. Well, 2187 divided by 9. Let me compute that. 9*243 = 2187 because 9*200=1800, 9*40=360, 9*3=27. 1800+360=2160 +27=2187. So 2187 /9=243. Therefore, overall:\n\n(1/625) * 243 = 243 / 625. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the eighth term is 243/625.\n\nBut let me just confirm once more by another approach. Let's compute each term step by step up to the eighth term. Maybe that will help verify.\n\nGiven the first term is 125/9.\n\nTerm 1: 125/9 ≈ 13.888...\n\nTerm 2: 125/9 * 3/5 = (125*3)/(9*5) = 375 / 45 = 25 / 3 ≈ 8.333... Correct.\n\nTerm 3: 25/3 * 3/5 = (25*3)/(3*5) = 75 / 15 = 5. Correct.\n\nTerm 4: 5 * 3/5 = 3. Correct.\n\nTerm 5: 3 * 3/5 = 9/5 = 1.8\n\nTerm 6: 9/5 * 3/5 = 27/25 = 1.08\n\nTerm 7: 27/25 * 3/5 = 81/125 = 0.648\n\nTerm 8: 81/125 * 3/5 = 243 / 625 ≈ 0.3888...\n\nSo yes, term 8 is 243/625. Therefore, the answer is 243/625.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1):\n\na_8 = (125/9) * (3/5)^7. As we computed, which gives 243/625.\n\nTherefore, I think that's correct. Let me check if 243 and 625 have any common factors. 243 is 3^5, and 625 is 5^4. Since 3 and 5 are primes, they don't share any common factors besides 1, so the fraction is already in simplest terms.\n\nTherefore, the eighth term is 243/625.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe eighth term of the sequence is \\boxed{\\dfrac{243}{625}}.\n</think>"}
