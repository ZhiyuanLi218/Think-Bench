{"question":"Question: Chemistry is closely related to life, the following statement is incorrect: ( ) Options: (A) Sodium carbonate can be used to remove grease from utensils (B) Bleaching powder can be used to disinfect household water (C) Aluminum hydroxide can be used to neutralize excess stomach acid (D) Barium carbonate can be used for gastrointestinal X-ray imaging exam","answer":"D","index":1024,"key_annotation_steps":{"solution1":{"logical_conclusion":["Step1: Analyze option A: Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) is a basic compound that can react with fatty acids in oil to form soap (saponification), making it effective for removing oil stains from dishes.","Step 2: Analyze Option B: Bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite, Ca(OCl)₂) contains hypochlorite ions, which have strong oxidizing properties and can kill pathogens, making it suitable for water disinfection.","Step 3: Analysis of Option C: Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a weak base that can neutralize excess stomach acid (HCl) without causing excessive alkalinity, making it an effective antacid.","Step 4: Analyze option D: Barium carbonate (BaCO₃) is highly toxic and not used for X-ray imaging. Instead, barium sulfate (BaSO₄) is the compound used for gastrointestinal X-ray imaging because it's insoluble and non-toxic.","Step 5: Therefore, option D is incorrect because it claims that barium carbonate is used for X-ray imaging, while in reality, the compound used for this purpose is barium sulfate."]}},"question_type":"Easy","category":"chemistry","subcategory":"others","prediction":"The question asks to identify the incorrect statement regarding the application of chemical compounds in everyday life. Let's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A**: Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is a base that effectively breaks down grease through saponification, making it a common ingredient in cleaning agents. This statement is **correct**.\n\n- **Option B**: Bleaching powder, which contains calcium hypochlorite, is a well-known disinfectant. It is used to kill pathogens in water, aligning with its chemical properties as a chlorine-based disinfectant. This statement is **correct**.\n\n- **Option C**: Aluminum hydroxide is a common component of antacids due to its ability to neutralize excess stomach acid (hydrochloric acid). This statement is **correct**.\n\n- **Option D**: Gastrointestinal X-ray imaging typically uses **barium sulfate**, not barium carbonate. Barium sulfate is insoluble and non-toxic, making it safe for ingestion. In contrast, **barium carbonate is highly toxic** and unsuitable for medical use. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{D}$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which of these statements is incorrect. The question is about chemistry and its relation to life, and we need to find the incorrect statement among the four options.\n\nStarting with option A: Sodium carbonate can be used to remove grease from utensils. I remember that sodium carbonate, also known as washing soda, is a base. Bases can help break down fats and oils because they react with them in a process called saponification, turning the grease into soap. So that makes sense. So A seems correct.\n\nOption B: Bleaching powder can be used to disinfect household water. Bleaching powder usually contains calcium hypochlorite, which is a common disinfectant. Chlorine compounds are used to kill bacteria and other pathogens in water. I've heard of using chlorine tablets or bleach to purify water, so B sounds correct.\n\nOption C: Aluminum hydroxide can be used to neutralize excess stomach acid. Antacids often contain aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide. These are bases that neutralize stomach acid (which is hydrochloric acid). So C is likely correct.\n\nOption D: Barium carbonate can be used for gastrointestinal X-ray imaging exams. Wait, I think for X-rays of the digestive system, they use a barium sulfate suspension. Barium sulfate is not soluble in water and is safe to ingest because it doesn't get absorbed. Barium carbonate, on the other hand, is toxic if ingested. So maybe D is incorrect because they should use barium sulfate instead of barium carbonate. That would make D the incorrect statement.\n</think>"}
