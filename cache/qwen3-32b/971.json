Let me start by recalling what angular momentum is. Angular momentum is a measure of the amount of rotation an object has, taking into account its moment of inertia and angular velocity. The formula for angular momentum (L) is L = Iω, where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity.\n\nNow, the question is about a system consisting of a man on a frictionless rotating platform. The key here is that the platform is frictionless, which probably means there's no external torque acting on the system, right? Because torque is what causes changes in angular momentum. If there's no external torque, the angular momentum should be conserved. So, the question is asking which of the options would change the angular momentum. But if the system is isolated with no external torques, then angular momentum should stay the same. So maybe the answer lies in which of these actions introduces an external torque?\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend. Hmm. If the baseball is thrown to him, then the baseball has some angular momentum relative to the axis of rotation. When he catches it, that angular momentum would be transferred to the man-platform system. But wait, is the baseball part of the system? The question says \"the man-platform system,\" so if the baseball is external (thrown by a friend not part of the system), then catching it would introduce external angular momentum. So that would change the total angular momentum of the system. So A might be an answer.\n\nOption B: The man thrusts his arms out away from his body. If he moves his arms out, he's changing his moment of inertia. But since there's no external torque, the angular momentum should stay the same. However, changing the moment of inertia would cause the angular velocity to change to compensate. For example, when a figure skater pulls their arms in, they spin faster. So thrusting arms out would increase the moment of inertia, so angular velocity would decrease. But the total angular momentum remains the same. Therefore, B doesn't change the angular momentum. So B is not the answer.\n\nOption C: The man thrusts his arms out and then quickly brings them back. Similar to B. Even though he's changing his moment of inertia twice, first increasing and then decreasing, there's no external torque. The angular momentum should still remain the same. The angular velocity would adjust accordingly each time he moves his arms. So even though he's moving his arms in and out, the total angular momentum of the system doesn't change. So C is not the answer.\n\nOption D: The man jumps straight up and lands back. Since he's on a frictionless platform, when he jumps up, he's still part of the system. If he jumps straight up, his motion is radial relative to the axis of rotation. Since angular momentum depends on tangential motion, jumping straight up doesn't add any angular momentum. When he lands back, he's back to the original state. So there's no change in angular momentum. So D is not the answer.\n\nSo the only one that could change the angular momentum is A, because adding an external object (the baseball) with its own angular momentum would change the total angular momentum of the system. However, I need to make sure that the friend throwing the ball is external. Since the system is man-platform, the friend and the baseball are external. Therefore, when the man catches the ball, external angular momentum is added, so the total angular momentum of the system changes. Therefore, A is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. If the platform is frictionless, but is there any other constraint? For example, if the friend throws the ball horizontally, then the ball has angular momentum relative to the axis of rotation. If the man catches it, that angular momentum is transferred. But if the friend throws the ball vertically, maybe not. But the problem doesn't specify, but I think in general, a thrown baseball would have some horizontal component. So assuming the ball is thrown tangentially, then yes, it would contribute angular momentum. So A is correct.\n\nSo the answer is A. Let me check again. The other options are internal movements, which can't change the angular momentum. Only external torques can. In A, catching an external object with angular momentum would add to the system's angular momentum. So yes, that's an external influence. Therefore, A is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
