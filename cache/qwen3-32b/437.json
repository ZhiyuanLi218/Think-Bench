Let me start by recalling what half-life means. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. So, every 36 minutes, the amount of the material is reduced by half.\n\nThe initial amount is 10.00 grams. The question is after 2 hours, how much is left? First, I should convert the total time from hours to minutes because the half-life is given in minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes. Now, I need to find out how many half-lives fit into 120 minutes. \n\nLet me calculate the number of half-lives: total time divided by half-life. So that's 120 minutes divided by 36 minutes per half-life. Let me do that division. 120 divided by 36... Hmm, 36 times 3 is 108, and 120 minus 108 is 12. So that's 3 and 12/36, which simplifies to 3 and 1/3 half-lives. Alternatively, as a decimal, that's 3.333... half-lives. \n\nSo the formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where N is the remaining amount, N0 is the initial amount, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life. Let me plug in the numbers. N0 is 10.00 grams, t is 120 minutes, T is 36 minutes. \n\nFirst, calculate the exponent: 120 / 36 = 3.333... So the exponent is 3.333... Then, (1/2)^3.333... Hmm, how do I calculate that? Let me think. 3.333... is 10/3. So (1/2)^(10/3). Which is the same as 1/(2^(10/3)). Let me compute 2^(10/3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down into whole half-lives and a fraction. Since 3 half-lives would be 3*36=108 minutes, and then there's an additional 12 minutes. So after 3 half-lives, the amount is 10.00 * (1/2)^3 = 10.00 * 1/8 = 1.25 grams. Then, there's an additional 12 minutes, which is 12/36 = 1/3 of a half-life. So I need to calculate how much decays in that 1/3 of a half-life. \n\nSo starting with 1.25 grams, after 1/3 of a half-life, the remaining amount would be 1.25 * (1/2)^(1/3). Let me compute that. (1/2)^(1/3) is the cube root of 1/2. The cube root of 1/2 is approximately 0.7937. So 1.25 * 0.7937 ≈ 1.25 * 0.7937. Let me calculate that. 1 * 0.7937 is 0.7937, 0.25 * 0.7937 is approximately 0.1984. Adding them together gives about 0.7937 + 0.1984 ≈ 0.9921 grams. So approximately 0.992 grams. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option A is 1.00 gram. That seems close. But wait, maybe my approximation is off. Let me check my calculations again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use logarithms or exponent rules to compute the exact value. Let me try that. \n\nThe exact formula is N = 10.00 * (1/2)^(120/36) = 10.00 * (1/2)^(10/3). Let me compute (1/2)^(10/3). Taking natural logarithm: ln(N/N0) = -(10/3) * ln(2). So ln(N) = ln(10.00) - (10/3) * ln(2). \n\nCalculating the numerical value: ln(10) is approximately 2.3026, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. \n\nSo ln(N) = 2.3026 - (10/3)*0.6931 ≈ 2.3026 - (2.3103) ≈ -0.0077. \n\nThen, exponentiating both sides: N ≈ e^(-0.0077) ≈ 1 - 0.0077 ≈ 0.9923 grams. So approximately 0.992 grams. Which is about 1.0 gram. So answer A is 1.00 gram. \n\nBut wait, the options are A:1.00 grams, B:1.5 × 10^-4 grams, C:3.33 grams, D:0.25 gram. So according to my calculation, it's approximately 1.00 gram. But let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent? Let me verify the number of half-lives. \n\nTotal time is 2 hours = 120 minutes. Half-life is 36 minutes. 120 divided by 36 is 3.333... So three and one-third half-lives. So the formula is N = N0 * (1/2)^3.333... So 10 * (1/2)^3.333... \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 2^(10/3). Let me compute 2^(10/3). 2^(1/3) is cube root of 2 ≈ 1.26. Then 2^(10/3) is (2^(1/3))^10 ≈ (1.26)^10. Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, 2^(10/3) = 2^3 * 2^(1/3) = 8 * 1.26 ≈ 10.08. Therefore, (1/2)^(10/3) = 1 / 10.08 ≈ 0.0992. Therefore, N = 10 * 0.0992 ≈ 0.992 grams. So again, approximately 1.0 gram. \n\nSo answer A is 1.00 gram. But let me check if the options have a more precise answer. The options are A:1.00 grams. But maybe the exact value is slightly less? Let me compute 2^(10/3) more accurately. \n\nLet me recall that 2^(1/3) is approximately 1.25992105. Therefore, 2^(10/3) = (2^(1/3))^10 = (approx) (1.25992105)^10. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 1.25992105 squared is approx 1.25992105 * 1.25992105. Let me compute 1.26^2 is 1.5876. But more accurately, since it's 1.2599... Let me use calculator-like steps. \n\nAlternatively, since 2^(10/3) is equal to e^( (10/3) * ln 2 ). Let me compute that. \n\n(10/3)*ln2 ≈ 3.3333 * 0.6931 ≈ Let me compute 3 * 0.6931 = 2.0793, 0.3333 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.2310. Total ≈ 2.0793 + 0.2310 ≈ 2.3103. So e^2.3103. What is e^2.3103? \n\nWe know that e^2 ≈ 7.389, e^2.3026 ≈ 10 (since ln10 ≈ 2.3026). So e^2.3103 is slightly more than 10. Let me compute the difference. 2.3103 - 2.3026 = 0.0077. So e^0.0077 ≈ 1 + 0.0077 + (0.0077)^2/2 ≈ 1.0077 + 0.00003 ≈ 1.0077. Therefore, e^2.3103 ≈ e^2.3026 * e^0.0077 ≈ 10 * 1.0077 ≈ 10.077. Therefore, 2^(10/3) ≈ 10.077. Therefore, (1/2)^(10/3) ≈ 1 / 10.077 ≈ 0.0992. Therefore, N = 10 * 0.0992 ≈ 0.992 grams. \n\nSo approximately 0.992 grams, which rounds to 1.00 gram if we consider two decimal places. Therefore, answer A is correct. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options again: option D is 0.25 gram. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of half-lives? Let me check again. \n\nStarting with 10 grams. After one half-life (36 min): 5 grams. After two half-lives (72 min): 2.5 grams. After three half-lives (108 min): 1.25 grams. After four half-lives (144 min): 0.625 grams. But 2 hours is 120 minutes, which is between 3 and 4 half-lives. So 120 - 108 = 12 minutes. So 12 minutes is 1/3 of a half-life. \n\nSo from 1.25 grams, we need to apply 1/3 of a half-life. So the remaining amount is 1.25 * (1/2)^(1/3). As calculated before, that's approx 1.25 * 0.7937 ≈ 0.992 grams. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using a different method? For example, using the formula with decimal exponents. Let me check with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula N = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, λ = ln(2) / T_half. T_half is 36 minutes. So λ = 0.6931 / 36 ≈ 0.01925 per minute. \n\nTime t is 120 minutes. \n\nSo N = 10.00 * e^(-0.01925 * 120). Let me compute the exponent: -0.01925 * 120 ≈ -2.31. \n\nSo e^-2.31 ≈ 1 / e^2.31 ≈ 1 / 10.0 ≈ 0.1. Therefore, N ≈ 10.00 * 0.1 = 1.00 gram. Which matches the previous result. \n\nSo again, approximately 1.00 gram. So answer A is correct. \n\nBut wait, why is option D 0.25 gram? Maybe if someone miscalculates the number of half-lives? For example, if they thought 2 hours is 3 half-lives? 3 half-lives is 108 minutes, which would leave 1.25 grams, which isn't any of the options. Wait, option C is 3.33 grams, which is 10 / 3. That would be if someone thought that 2 hours is 1/3 of a half-life? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone thought that 2 hours is 36 * something? Wait, 2 hours is 120 minutes. 120 divided by 36 is 3.333... So three and a third half-lives. If someone did three half-lives (which is 1.25 grams) and then thought that a third half-life is another half, so 1.25 * 0.5 = 0.625 grams? But that would be if they took another half-life, but it's only a third of a half-life. So that approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone used log base 10 instead of natural log? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the initial calculation. Let me check once again. \n\nNumber of half-lives: 120 / 36 = 3.333... \n\nSo (1/2)^3.333... is equal to e^(-ln2 * 3.333...) ≈ e^(-2.31) ≈ 0.1, so 10 * 0.1 = 1.0 gram. \n\nTherefore, answer A is correct. \n\nBut let me check with exact fractions. Let's do it step by step. \n\nStarting with 10 grams. \n\nAfter 1st half-life (36 min): 10 * 1/2 = 5 grams. \n\nAfter 2nd half-life (72 min): 5 * 1/2 = 2.5 grams. \n\nAfter 3rd half-life (108 min): 2.5 * 1/2 = 1.25 grams. \n\nNow, remaining time is 120 - 108 = 12 minutes. \n\nSo 12 minutes is 1/3 of 36 minutes. \n\nSo decay for 1/3 of a half-life. \n\nThe formula for a fraction of a half-life is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T). \n\nSo here, t = 12 min, T = 36 min, so t / T = 1/3. \n\nTherefore, N = 1.25 * (1/2)^(1/3). \n\nAs before, (1/2)^(1/3) is cube root of 1/2 ≈ 0.7937. \n\nSo 1.25 * 0.7937 ≈ 0.992 grams. \n\nSo, approximately 1.0 gram. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A:1.00 grams. \n\nBut wait, let me check if the options are maybe using a different approximation. For example, if they used (1/2)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8 instead of 0.7937, then 1.25 * 0.8 = 1.0 gram. So that's exact. So maybe the answer is intended to be 1.0 gram. \n\nAlternatively, if someone did 10 * (1/2)^3.333... as 10 / 2^3.333... and approximated 2^3.333... as 2^(10/3) = 10.08, then 10 / 10.08 ≈ 0.992, which is 1.0 gram when rounded to two decimal places. \n\nTherefore, answer A is correct. \n\nBut let me check the given options again. The options are A:1.00 grams, B:1.5 × 10^-4 grams, C:3.33 grams, D:0.25 gram. \n\nSo A is 1.00 grams. So I think that's the answer. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possibility that the question is in a different context. For example, maybe the half-life is 36 minutes, but the question is about 2 hours in a different way? No, 2 hours is 120 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in converting hours to minutes? 2 hours is 120 minutes. Yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different definition of half-life? No, the standard definition is that after one half-life, half remains. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that after each half-life, you multiply by 0.5, but someone might have miscalculated the number of half-lives. For example, if someone thought that 2 hours is 2 half-lives (which would be 72 minutes), but no, 2 hours is longer than that. \n\nAlternatively, someone might have thought that 36 minutes is 0.6 hours, so 2 / 0.6 = 3.333... half-lives. Which is the same as before. \n\nSo, yes, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be A:1.00 grams. \n\nBut let me check if the options have a typo or something. The options given are A:1.00 grams, B:1.5 × 10^-4 grams, C:3.33 grams, D:0.25 gram. \n\nIf the answer was supposed to be 1.25 grams, but that's not an option. However, option C is 3.33 grams. That would be if the calculation was done incorrectly, for example, if someone thought that the number of half-lives is 3, then 10 / 2^3 = 1.25 grams, but that's not an option. Wait, 1.25 grams is not listed. The closest is option D:0.25 gram, which is 10 / 2^4 = 0.625, then 0.3125 after 5 half-lives. But 0.25 is after 5 half-lives? Wait, 10 / 2^5 = 10 / 32 = 0.3125. 10 / 2^6 = 0.15625. So 0.25 is not directly from halving. Maybe someone did 10 / 3 = 3.33 grams? Which is option C. \n\nBut why would they do that? If someone thought that the number of half-lives is 1/3, then 10 * (1/2)^(1/3) ≈ 10 * 0.793 ≈ 7.93 grams. Not option C. \n\nAlternatively, if someone miscalculated the number of half-lives as 120 / 36 = 3.33, and then thought that 3.33 half-lives is 3 half-lives and 0.33 grams? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different half-life? Let me check again. The problem says a half-life of 36 minutes. Starting with 10.00 grams, after 2 hours. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A:1.00 grams. \n\nBut to be 100% sure, let me use another method. Let me use the formula N = N0 * e^(-λt). \n\nFirst, calculate λ. λ = ln(2)/T_half. T_half is 36 minutes. \n\nλ ≈ 0.6931 / 36 ≈ 0.01925 per minute. \n\nTime t is 120 minutes. \n\nSo λt ≈ 0.01925 * 120 ≈ 2.31. \n\nSo N = 10.00 * e^(-2.31). \n\nNow, e^-2.31 ≈ ? Let me recall that e^-2 ≈ 0.1353, e^-2.3 ≈ 0.1003, e^-2.3026 ≈ 0.1 (since ln(10) ≈ 2.3026). So e^-2.31 ≈ 0.1003 * e^(-0.0074). Since 2.31 = 2.3026 + 0.0074. \n\nSo e^-0.0074 ≈ 1 - 0.0074 ≈ 0.9926. Therefore, e^-2.31 ≈ 0.1003 * 0.9926 ≈ 0.0996. \n\nTherefore, N ≈ 10.00 * 0.0996 ≈ 0.996 grams ≈ 1.00 gram. \n\nSo again, the answer is approximately 1.00 gram. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option A:1.00 grams. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
