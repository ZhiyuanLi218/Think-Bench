Despite the constant speed, the object is **accelerating** because the **direction of the velocity vector changes continuously**. The acceleration, known as **centripetal acceleration**, is always directed **toward the center** of the circle.\n\n---\n\nLet's evaluate the options in detail:\n\n- **Option A**: *\"The centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force.\"*  \n  This is **false**. Centrifugal force is a **fictitious force** that only appears in non-inertial (rotating) reference frames. In an inertial frame, the only real force is the **centripetal force**, which is directed **toward the center**. According to **Newton's third law**, the centripetal force has an equal and opposite reaction force, but this is not the centrifugal force. The reaction force is the force the object exerts **on the source** of the centripetal force (e.g., a ball pulling on a string), not the centrifugal force itself.\n\n- **Option B**: *\"The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in the same direction.\"*  \n  This is **false**. The **velocity** vector in circular motion is **tangent** to the circle, while the **centripetal acceleration** vector is **perpendicular** to the velocity and points **toward the center**. Therefore, they do **not** point in the same direction.\n\n- **Option C**: *\"The velocity of the object in motion changes whereas the acceleration of the object is constant.\"*  \n  This is **false**. While it is true that the **velocity vector changes** (because its direction is changing), the **acceleration is not constant** in direction. The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is constant in uniform circular motion, but the **direction** is always changing to point toward the center of the circle. Therefore, the **acceleration vector is not constant**.\n\n- **Option D**: *\"A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path.\"*  \n  This is **true**. A satellite in orbit is in **free fall** under the influence of gravity, which acts as the **centripetal force** that keeps it moving in a circular path. The satellite is constantly **accelerating toward the center** of the Earth, but because it also has a **tangential velocity**, it doesn't crash into the Earth. Instead, it **\"falls\" in a circular path**, maintaining a stable orbit.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the given options about uniform circular motion is true. Let me start by recalling what uniform circular motion is. From what I remember, uniform circular motion is when an object moves in a circular path at a constant speed. Even though the speed is constant, the direction of the velocity is constantly changing, which means the object is accelerating. This acceleration is called centripetal acceleration, and it's directed towards the center of the circle.\n\nNow, let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: \"The centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force.\" Hmm, I think centrifugal force is a common term people use, but isn't it a fictitious force? Like, in an inertial frame of reference, the only real force acting is the centripetal force, which is directed towards the center. The centrifugal force is what you feel in a rotating frame of reference, like when you're in a car making a turn and you feel pushed outward. But according to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The centripetal force's reaction force would be the force exerted by the object on whatever is providing the centripetal force. For example, if a string is providing the centripetal force on a ball, the ball pulls back on the string with an equal and opposite force. But this reaction force isn't the centrifugal force. So maybe option A is incorrect because centrifugal force isn't the reaction pair; it's a fictitious force. So A is probably false.\n\nOption B: \"The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in the same direction.\" Wait, velocity in circular motion is tangent to the circle, right? And centripetal acceleration is towards the center. So they are perpendicular to each other, not in the same direction. So B is false.\n\nOption C: \"The velocity of the object in motion changes whereas the acceleration of the object is constant.\" Well, velocity is a vector, so even if the speed is constant, the direction is changing, so velocity is changing. But what about acceleration? In uniform circular motion, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is constant (a = v²/r), but the direction is always towards the center, which is changing as the object moves around the circle. So the acceleration vector isn't constant because its direction is changing. Therefore, the acceleration isn't constant. So option C says the acceleration is constant, which is false. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path.\" Hmm. Satellites in orbit are indeed in free fall towards Earth, but their horizontal velocity is such that they keep missing the Earth, resulting in a circular (or elliptical) orbit. So the idea is that the satellite is continuously falling towards the center (due to gravity providing the centripetal force), but because of its tangential velocity, it doesn't crash into the Earth. So the statement says it's falling toward the center in a circular path. That seems correct. The satellite is constantly accelerating towards the center due to gravity, which is the centripetal acceleration. So D might be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \"falling toward the center in a circular path\" – is that accurate? The satellite is moving in a circular path, and its acceleration is directed towards the center. So the motion is a result of the centripetal acceleration, which is caused by gravity. So yes, the satellite is effectively \"falling\" towards the center, but because of its sideways motion, it keeps orbiting. So D is true. \n\nSo reviewing all options: A is false because centrifugal isn't the reaction force. B is false because velocity and acceleration are perpendicular. C is false because acceleration isn't constant (direction changes). D is true. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.\n</think>"}
