The given quantities are the elastic scattering cross section $ \\sigma_{\\text{e}} $ and the total cross section $ \\sigma $, both independent of energy. The antiprotons have an incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $. \n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts about cross sections and probabilities in particle physics. The total cross section $ \\sigma $ includes all possible interactions: elastic, inelastic, absorption, etc. Since we are told that $ \\sigma_{\\text{e}} $ and $ \\sigma $ are independent of energy, I don't have to worry about energy-dependent variations here.\n\nThe problem is about the probability of having exactly $ n $ elastic scatterings without being absorbed. So, each time the antiproton interacts, there's a chance it's elastic or not. Since we want the antiproton to be elastically scattered $ n $ times and not absorbed, I need to model this as a sequence of events where each interaction is either elastic or not. The \"not absorbed\" part probably refers to any interaction that's not elastic leading to the antiproton being removed from the beam (i.e., absorbed or inelastically scattered).\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using the Poisson distribution or perhaps a geometric distribution, but since we need exactly $ n $ elastic scatterings before an absorption, maybe it's a combination of both. Wait, but the antiproton is moving through a medium (liquid hydrogen) of a certain length, so the number of interactions depends on the path length, the density of the medium, and the cross sections.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the mean free path $ \\lambda $. The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between interactions and is given by $ \\lambda = 1/(n_{\\text{t}} \\sigma) $, where $ n_{\\text{t}} $ is the target particle number density. However, here we have a bubble chamber of length $ l $, so the number of interactions depends on how many times the antiproton travels the mean free path within the length $ l $.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give me the density of liquid hydrogen. However, maybe I need to express the probability in terms of the given quantities $ \\sigma_e $, $ \\sigma $, and $ l $, and the momentum $ p $. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nThe probability of an interaction occurring in a small distance $ dx $ is $ P(dx) = n_{\\text{t}} \\sigma dx $. Therefore, the probability of no interaction over a distance $ x $ is $ e^{-n_{\\text{t}} \\sigma x} $. However, since the problem mentions elastic scattering specifically, perhaps I need to consider the probability of elastic scattering versus other interactions.\n\nGiven that the total cross section is $ \\sigma $, and the elastic cross section is $ \\sigma_e $, the probability that any given interaction is elastic is $ \\sigma_e / \\sigma $, and the probability that it's an absorption (or inelastic, etc.) is $ 1 - \\sigma_e / \\sigma $.\n\nTherefore, if the antiproton undergoes $ n $ elastic scatterings before being absorbed, this is similar to a scenario where we have a sequence of $ n $ successes (elastic scatterings) followed by a failure (absorption). However, the antiproton doesn't necessarily have to be absorbed right after the $ n $th scattering; it could be that after $ n $ scatterings, it just exits the chamber without being absorbed. Wait, the problem says \"being elastically scattered $ n $ times without being absorbed and leaving the bubble chamber.\" So, the antiproton must have $ n $ elastic scatterings, never being absorbed (i.e., never undergoing an inelastic interaction), and then exits the chamber.\n\nTherefore, this is a problem where each interaction is either elastic or absorption (assuming that total cross section is elastic + absorption; maybe there are other inelastic processes, but since we are told to consider only elastic and being absorbed, maybe we can take $ \\sigma = \\sigma_e + \\sigma_{\\text{abs}} $, where $ \\sigma_{\\text{abs}} = \\sigma - \\sigma_e $).\n\nTherefore, each time there's an interaction, the probability it's elastic is $ \\sigma_e / \\sigma $, and the probability it's absorption is $ 1 - \\sigma_e / \\sigma $.\n\nNow, the antiproton needs to have $ n $ elastic interactions and then exit the chamber without being absorbed. However, the antiproton's path through the chamber is of length $ l $. Therefore, the total number of interactions is a random variable, and we need the probability that exactly $ n $ of them are elastic and none are absorption, and that after those $ n $ interactions, the antiproton has not yet exited the chamber. Wait, this seems complicated because the number of interactions depends on the path length and the cross sections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a Poisson process with two types of events: elastic and absorption. In a Poisson process, the number of events in a given interval is Poisson distributed. However, since we have two types of events, elastic and absorption, we can model them as independent Poisson processes with rates proportional to their cross sections.\n\nThe total rate of interactions is $ \\lambda_{\\text{total}} = n_t \\sigma $, and the rate for elastic scattering is $ \\lambda_e = n_t \\sigma_e $, and for absorption $ \\lambda_a = n_t (\\sigma - \\sigma_e) $. In a Poisson process, the number of elastic events $ N_e $ and absorption events $ N_a $ in a path length $ l $ are Poisson distributed with means $ \\mu_e = n_t \\sigma_e l $ and $ \\mu_a = n_t (\\sigma - \\sigma_e) l $, respectively, and they are independent.\n\nHowever, if we want the probability that there are exactly $ n $ elastic scatterings and zero absorptions, that would be the product of the Poisson probabilities for $ N_e = n $ and $ N_a = 0 $:\n\n$ P(n, 0) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu_e} \\mu_e^n}{n!} \\cdot e^{-\\mu_a} \\frac{\\mu_a^0}{0!} } = e^{-\\mu_e - \\mu_a} \\frac{\\mu_e^n}{n!} } = e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!} } $.\n\nBut this is the probability that there are exactly $ n $ elastic scatterings and no absorptions in the entire path length $ l $. However, the problem states that the antiproton leaves the chamber after being elastically scattered $ n $ times without being absorbed. However, in this model, even if there are $ n $ elastic scatterings, the antiproton is still in the chamber until it has traveled length $ l $. But if there are $ n $ scatterings, does that necessarily mean that after those scatterings, it exits? Not necessarily. The number of scatterings is independent of the path length? Wait, no. The Poisson process models the number of interactions in the entire length $ l $. So if there are $ n $ elastic and zero absorptions, then the antiproton has not been absorbed and has scattered $ n $ times, but it still exits the chamber because it has traveled the full length $ l $. Therefore, the probability would be as above.\n\nHowever, the problem is that in reality, once an antiproton is scattered, it might change direction, so its path length through the chamber is not necessarily straight. However, the problem says \"antiprotons with incident momentum $ p $\", so maybe we are assuming that they are moving in a straight line? Or do we have to consider that each scattering changes the direction, so the effective path length is longer?\n\nThis is a crucial point. If the antiprotons are elastically scattered, they might change direction, so their actual path length through the liquid hydrogen would be longer than $ l $, the length of the chamber. However, bubble chambers are usually designed such that particles enter and exit through the same side, but depending on their trajectory, they might have a longer path. However, since the problem gives a fixed length $ l $, perhaps we are to assume that regardless of scatterings, the antiproton travels a straight path of length $ l $. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the antiprotons are moving in a straight line, so their path length is fixed at $ l $, and each scattering doesn't significantly alter their trajectory (which might be the case if they are high-energy, as stated). Since they are high-energy antiprotons, multiple elastic scatterings might not significantly deviate their path, so the total path length can be approximated as $ l $.\n\nTherefore, assuming that the path length is fixed at $ l $, regardless of scatterings, then the previous calculation applies. Therefore, the probability is $ P(n) = \\frac{(\\mu)^n}{n!} e^{-\\mu} \\times e^{-\\mu_a} $? Wait, no, earlier I combined them into $ e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!} $. But $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $, so this is $ P(n) = e^{-\\mu} \\frac{(\\mu \\sigma_e / \\sigma)^n}{n!} } $. Wait, let me redo the calculation.\n\nThe mean number of elastic events is $ \\mu_e = n_t \\sigma_e l $, and the mean number of absorption events is $ \\mu_a = n_t (\\sigma - \\sigma_e) l $. Since they are independent Poisson variables, the probability of $ n $ elastic and 0 absorption is:\n\n$ P(n) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu_e} \\mu_e^n}{n!} \\times e^{-\\mu_a} \\frac{\\mu_a^0}{0!} } = e^{-\\mu_e - \\mu_a} \\frac{\\mu_e^n}{n!} } = e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!} } $.\n\nTherefore, this is the probability. However, the problem is that the question says \"leaving the bubble chamber\". If the antiproton is absorbed, it doesn't leave. If it is elastically scattered multiple times but never absorbed, then it leaves. Therefore, the above expression is indeed the probability of being elastically scattered $ n $ times and not being absorbed, and exiting the chamber. Therefore, this is the answer? But the problem is that in this approach, we need to know $ n_t $, the number density of liquid hydrogen. However, the problem doesn't give us that. The problem says to find the probability in terms of $ \\sigma_e $, $ \\sigma $, $ l $, and the incident momentum $ p $. So how do we relate $ n_t $ to the given quantities?\n\nAh, here's the missing piece. The number density $ n_t $ can be related to the material's properties. For liquid hydrogen, we can calculate the number density using its density and molar mass. However, since the problem doesn't provide numerical values, perhaps we need to express the probability in terms of the areal density or something related to the momentum?\n\nWait, another approach: The probability of an interaction is related to the cross section and the number of targets. The number of targets encountered by the antiproton is $ N = n_t l $, but no, cross section has dimensions of area. The correct formula is that the probability of at least one interaction in length $ l $ is $ P = 1 - e^{-n_t \\sigma l} $. However, to relate $ n_t $ to something we can calculate, we need to use the material properties.\n\nBut since the problem is about antiprotons in liquid hydrogen, perhaps we can express $ n_t $ in terms of the density of liquid hydrogen. Let me recall that the number density $ n_t $ is equal to the density $ \\rho $ divided by the molar mass $ M $, multiplied by Avogadro's number $ N_A $:\n\n$ n_t = \\frac{\\rho N_A}{M} $.\n\nHowever, without knowing the density $ \\rho $ of liquid hydrogen or its molar mass $ M $, we can't compute a numerical value. However, the problem gives the incident momentum $ p $, which might be a red herring or maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects us to use the relation between the momentum and the mean free path? Or perhaps the momentum is not directly relevant here? Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that both cross sections are independent of energy. Therefore, the momentum $ p $ might not affect the cross sections, but perhaps it affects the number of targets encountered? No, the number density is a property of the material. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the \"interaction length\" or something else?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the relation between the cross section and the probability without needing the number density? That seems unlikely. Wait, but in bubble chamber experiments, the track length is related to the particle's momentum. However, if the antiprotons are moving in a straight line (assuming no magnetic field?), then their path length is fixed as $ l $, regardless of momentum. But if there is a magnetic field, their path would be curved, but the problem doesn't mention a magnetic field. So maybe we can assume straight line?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the \"total number of collisions\" based on the particle's momentum? Wait, no, the number of collisions depends on the density, cross section, and path length. Unless there's another relation I'm missing.\n\nWait, here's a thought. In particle physics, when dealing with cross sections, sometimes the formula involves the flux and the target density. The probability of an interaction is given by $ P = 1 - e^{-n_t \\sigma l} $, but again, without $ n_t $, how can we express it?\n\nBut the problem says \"find the probability... for antiprotons with incident momentum $ p $\". Maybe the momentum $ p $ is needed to calculate the number density? No, the number density is a property of the target material. Unless there's something else. Wait, maybe in the context of the bubble chamber, the antiprotons are slowing down as they traverse the medium, but the problem says they are high-energy, so energy loss is negligible? The problem states that cross sections are independent of energy, so maybe we can assume that the momentum doesn't change significantly, so the path length is indeed $ l $, and the number density is fixed.\n\nBut since the problem gives us momentum $ p $, but doesn't provide any other information about the liquid hydrogen, maybe there is a standard formula or relation that I'm missing here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the \"opacity\" or \"optical depth\" of the chamber? The optical depth $ \\tau = n_t \\sigma l $. Then the probability of $ n $ elastic scatterings and no absorption would be $ e^{-\\tau} \\frac{(\\tau \\sigma_e / \\sigma)^n}{n!} } $. However, without knowing $ \\tau $, we can't write it numerically. But since the problem asks for the probability in terms of given quantities, which include $ \\sigma_e $, $ \\sigma $, $ l $, and $ p $, perhaps there is a way to express $ n_t $ in terms of $ p $?\n\nWait, unless there's a relation between the momentum and the number density through the scattering? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the relation between the cross section and the scattering angle, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the differential cross section? No, the problem gives total and elastic cross sections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in error and the momentum is irrelevant? But the problem says \"for antiprotons with incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $\", so maybe it's just specifying that they are high-energy, so that multiple scattering doesn't bend their trajectory, hence path length is $ l $, and the momentum is not directly used in the formula. In that case, the answer would be as derived earlier, but expressed in terms of $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $. However, since the problem doesn't give $ n_t $, maybe we need to express $ n_t $ in terms of the liquid hydrogen density?\n\nBut since the problem is theoretical, maybe we are supposed to leave the answer in terms of $ n_t $? However, the problem says \"find the probability... for antiprotons with incident momentum $ p $\", implying that the answer should be in terms of the given quantities $ \\sigma_e $, $ \\sigma $, $ l $, and $ p $. Therefore, there must be a way to relate $ n_t $ to $ p $.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the fact that the number of scatterings depends on the velocity? The mean free path depends on the velocity because the number of collisions is related to the time spent in the medium. However, cross sections are usually given per unit area, and the interaction rate is $ n_t \\sigma v $, where $ v $ is the velocity. However, in our previous calculation, we considered the probability over a length $ l $, not time. The mean free path is $ \\lambda = 1/(n_t \\sigma) $, so the number of interactions in a length $ l $ is $ l / \\lambda = n_t \\sigma l $. Therefore, velocity doesn't factor into the number of interactions along a fixed length. Therefore, the momentum $ p $ is not directly needed for the calculation of the number of interactions along length $ l $, assuming the path is straight.\n\nBut the problem gives the momentum $ p $. Maybe it's a red herring? Or perhaps there is a different approach where momentum is needed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a magnetic field, causing the antiprotons to follow a circular path? But the problem mentions a bubble chamber of length $ l $, which usually implies a straight length, unless it's in a magnetic field. However, without specific information about the magnetic field or the radius of curvature, we can't relate momentum to the path length.\n\nWait, if there is a magnetic field, then the radius of curvature $ R $ of the antiproton's path is related to its momentum by $ p = q B R $, where $ q $ is the charge and $ B $ is the magnetic field. However, without knowing $ B $, we can't relate $ p $ to $ R $, and hence to the path length. Therefore, this seems too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the relation between the momentum and the number density via the de Broglie wavelength? No, that seems unrelated.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"A beam of high-energy antiprotons enters a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber of length $ l $.\" High-energy usually means that the particles are relativistic, so their velocity is close to the speed of light. However, as mentioned before, for a fixed path length $ l $, the number of interactions is independent of velocity. Therefore, the probability only depends on $ l $, the cross sections, and the number density $ n_t $. Since the problem doesn't provide $ n_t $, but asks for the answer in terms of given quantities, maybe there's a standard expression for the number density of liquid hydrogen?\n\nLet me recall that liquid hydrogen has a density of about 0.07 g/cm³ at standard conditions. The molar mass of hydrogen is approximately 1 g/mol. Therefore, the number density $ n_t $ can be approximated as:\n\n$ n_t = \\frac{\\rho N_A}{M} $, where $ \\rho = 0.07 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 = 70 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 $, $ M = 1 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 0.001 \\, \\text{kg/mol} $, and $ N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\, \\text{mol}^{-1} $.\n\nCalculating $ n_t $:\n\n$ n_t = \\frac{70 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23}}{0.001} = 70 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{26} \\approx 4.215 \\times 10^{28} \\, \\text{m}^{-3} $.\n\nBut again, this is a numerical value, and the problem is asking for an expression, not a numerical answer. Therefore, unless the problem expects us to use this standard value for liquid hydrogen and express the probability in terms of that, but since it's not given in the problem statement, this seems unlikely. The problem says \"find the probability... for antiprotons with incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $\", so maybe there is another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the antiprotons are annihilating with the protons in the liquid hydrogen? Since antiprotons and protons are both hadrons, their interaction can lead to annihilation, which would be part of the total cross section. However, this still doesn't help us relate $ n_t $ to $ p $.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the relation between the cross section and the momentum transfer? But again, not directly.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's think about the probability of surviving $ n $ scatterings without being absorbed. Each time the antiproton interacts, it's either elastic or not. The probability of surviving $ n $ scatterings would be the probability that each of those $ n $ interactions is elastic, and then after those $ n $ interactions, the antiproton hasn't been absorbed and exits the chamber.\n\nBut how do we model the number of interactions? Let's think in terms of the probability distribution for the number of interactions.\n\nThe probability that the antiproton has exactly $ k $ interactions in the chamber is Poisson distributed with mean $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $. The probability of exactly $ k $ interactions is $ P(k) = e^{-\\mu} \\frac{\\mu^k}{k!} $. For each of these $ k $ interactions, the probability that all are elastic is $ (\\sigma_e / \\sigma)^k $. Therefore, the total probability that the antiproton has exactly $ k $ interactions and all are elastic is $ P(k) \\times (\\sigma_e / \\sigma)^k = e^{-\\mu} \\frac{(\\mu \\sigma_e / \\sigma)^k}{k!} $.\n\nHowever, the problem wants the probability that the antiproton is elastically scattered $ n $ times and then exits the chamber without being absorbed. This would be the case if it has exactly $ n $ interactions, all elastic, and then exits. Therefore, the probability is $ e^{-\\mu} \\frac{(\\mu \\sigma_e / \\sigma)^n}{n!} $.\n\nBut again, this requires knowing $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $. Since the problem gives us $ l $, $ \\sigma $, $ \\sigma_e $, but not $ n_t $, how do we proceed? The problem must expect an answer in terms of $ \\mu $, but since it's not given, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe the problem assumes that the antiprotons are not absorbed until they exit, so the probability is the probability of exactly $ n $ elastic scatterings and no other interactions. Which is what I derived earlier. However, since $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $ is not given, but the problem says \"for antiprotons with incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $\", perhaps there is a relation between the momentum and the number density? For example, in a gas, the number density can be related to pressure and temperature via the ideal gas law, but liquid hydrogen is not a gas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that the antiprotons have a certain momentum, so their velocity is known, and hence the time they spend in the chamber is known, which would relate to the number of interactions? But earlier, I thought that for a fixed length $ l $, the number of interactions is independent of velocity. However, if we consider the time spent in the chamber, then the number of interactions would depend on the velocity.\n\nLet me think again. The interaction rate is $ \\Gamma = n_t \\sigma v $, where $ v $ is the velocity. The time spent in the chamber is $ t = l / v $. Therefore, the expected number of interactions is $ \\Gamma t = n_t \\sigma l $, which is the same as before. Therefore, the number of interactions only depends on $ l $, $ n_t $, and $ \\sigma $, and not on velocity. Hence, even if we know the momentum $ p $, since $ v = p / (\\gamma m) $ for relativistic particles, but since $ n_t \\sigma l $ doesn't depend on $ v $, the momentum is not directly involved here. Therefore, the answer cannot be expressed without $ n_t $, unless there's some other relation.\n\nWait, but the problem is from a textbook or an exam question, so maybe there's a standard way to present it. Let me check the units. The cross sections have units of area, length $ l $ has units of length. The product $ n_t \\sigma l $ is dimensionless, as it should be for a Poisson mean. However, without knowing $ n_t $, we can't compute it. Therefore, maybe the problem expects the answer expressed in terms of the \"opacity\" $ \\tau = n_t \\sigma l $, but since $ \\tau $ is not given, this seems impossible.\n\nWait, unless the problem assumes that the antiproton exits the chamber only after being scattered $ n $ times, implying that the total path length is such that the expected number of interactions is related to $ n $. But that seems like a different problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the probability of surviving $ n $ scatterings, considering that after each scattering, there's a probability of being absorbed. This would be similar to a Bernoulli process.\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the antiproton travels through the chamber, and each interaction has a probability $ p_e = \\sigma_e / \\sigma $ of being elastic and $ p_a = 1 - p_e $ of being absorption. The antiproton needs to have $ n $ elastic scatterings and then exit without being absorbed. However, the number of interactions is not fixed; it depends on the path length.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the antiproton needs to have $ n $ successes (elastic) before the first failure (absorption). This is similar to the negative binomial distribution. In the negative binomial distribution, the probability of having $ n $ successes before $ r $ failures is given by... For our case, $ r = 1 $, so we want the probability that the first failure occurs after $ n $ successes.\n\nIn the negative binomial distribution, the probability that the $ n $th success occurs on the $ k $th trial is $ P(k) = \\binom{k - 1}{n - 1} p_e^n (1 - p_e)^{k - n} $. However, in our case, the number of trials isn't fixed; it depends on the path length. This seems complicated again.\n\nBut if we model the number of interactions as a Poisson process, as before, then the probability of exactly $ n $ elastic and zero absorption is $ e^{-\\mu} \\frac{(\\mu \\sigma_e / \\sigma)^n}{n!} } $, where $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $. However, since we don't have $ n_t $, perhaps the problem expects this expression as the answer, with the understanding that $ \\mu $ is $ n_t \\sigma l $. But the problem says \"find the probability... for antiprotons with incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $\", so maybe there is a way to express $ n_t $ in terms of $ p $?\n\nWait, here's an idea. In a bubble chamber, the track length of a particle is related to its momentum if there is a magnetic field. If the bubble chamber is in a magnetic field $ B $, then the radius of curvature $ R $ of the particle's path is given by $ p = q B R $, where $ q $ is the charge. If the chamber has a length $ l $, maybe this refers to the diameter of the chamber, and the particle's path is a semicircle? But without knowing the magnetic field strength or the geometry, it's impossible to relate $ l $ to the actual path length.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the antiprotons are moving in a straight line through the chamber of length $ l $, then their path length is $ l $, and $ n_t $ is fixed. But since the problem gives momentum $ p $, maybe it's expecting us to use the relation between the cross section and the scattering angle, but I don't see the connection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that the antiprotons have a certain momentum, and thus their de Broglie wavelength is something, but again, not relevant for cross sections which are classical in this context.\n\nWait, another thought: In particle physics, when you have a beam going through a target, the probability of a certain number of interactions is often expressed using the cross sections and the target thickness in units of \"g/cm²\" (areal density). The areal density $ \\rho t $ (density times thickness) can be related to the number of targets via $ N = \\rho t N_A / M $, similar to what I did earlier. However, since the problem gives length $ l $, if we assume that the areal density is $ \\rho l $, but without knowing the density $ \\rho $, we can't proceed. However, maybe the problem assumes that the antiprotons interact with protons in the liquid hydrogen, and since liquid hydrogen is mostly protons (assuming it's hydrogen atoms, which have one proton each), the number density $ n_t $ is the number of protons per unit volume.\n\nBut again, without numerical values, we can't compute it. However, if the problem is theoretical, maybe it's acceptable to leave the answer in terms of $ n_t $, but the problem says \"find the probability... for antiprotons with incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $\", so I'm missing something.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: it says \"elastic scattering cross section and the total cross section, respectively. Assume both are independent of energy.\" So maybe energy independence implies that we can relate the momentum to the cross section somehow? No, cross sections are independent of energy (i.e., momentum), so that doesn't help.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's think about the probability of surviving $ n $ scatterings. Suppose that the antiproton travels through the chamber, and each infinitesimal segment $ dx $ has a probability $ dP $ of interaction. The probability of an interaction in $ dx $ is $ dP = n_t \\sigma dx $. The probability that this interaction is elastic is $ \\sigma_e / \\sigma $, and absorption is $ 1 - \\sigma_e / \\sigma $. \n\nNow, the probability of being elastically scattered exactly $ n $ times and not absorbed at all until exiting the chamber can be modeled as follows: the antiproton has $ n $ elastic scatterings at positions $ x_1, x_2, ..., x_n $, and no other interactions between 0 and $ l $. The probability is then the integral over all possible positions of these $ n $ scatterings, multiplied by the probability density for those scatterings and no others.\n\nThis is similar to the derivation of the Poisson distribution. The probability of exactly $ n $ events in a Poisson process is $ e^{-\\mu} \\mu^n / n! $, where $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $. And as before, since each interaction is elastic with probability $ \\sigma_e / \\sigma $, the probability becomes $ e^{-\\mu} (\\mu \\sigma_e / \\sigma)^n / n! $.\n\nTherefore, this seems to be the correct expression, but it requires knowledge of $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $. Since the problem doesn't give $ n_t $, but asks for the answer in terms of given quantities, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the fact that the antiprotons have a certain momentum $ p $, and thus their velocity is known, and therefore the time they spend in the chamber is $ t = l / v $. Then, the expected number of interactions is $ \\lambda = n_t \\sigma v t = n_t \\sigma l $, which brings us back to the same expression. Therefore, the momentum $ p $ is not directly involved in the calculation. Hence, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps the momentum is irrelevant, and the answer is simply $ e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!} $.\n\nHowever, since the problem specifies the incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $, and in most physics problems such details are not included without being necessary, I must be missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that in a bubble chamber, the antiprotons leave tracks, and the number of scatterings corresponds to the number of visible interactions. But again, this doesn't affect the probability calculation.\n\nWait, another possibility: the problem is in a magnetic field, and the length $ l $ is the effective path length in terms of the particle's momentum. For example, in a magnetic field, the radius of curvature $ R $ is related to the momentum $ p $ by $ p = qBR $. If the chamber has a certain geometry, say a cylindrical chamber of length $ l $, then the actual path length depends on the momentum. For instance, if the particle is moving perpendicular to the magnetic field, it would follow a circular path, but if it's moving along the length, it would be a straight line. However, without specific information about the magnetic field or the chamber's geometry, this is too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the relativistic relation between momentum and velocity to express $ n_t $ in terms of $ p $? For example, if we know the velocity $ v $, we could relate it to $ p $, but as previously established, the number of interactions doesn't depend on $ v $ for a fixed length $ l $.\n\nWait, here's a different angle: In the derivation of the probability, we assumed a fixed path length $ l $. But if the antiproton is scattered multiple times, its actual path length might be longer than $ l $. For example, after each elastic scattering, it might change direction slightly, leading to a longer effective path length. This is similar to the concept of \"radiation length\" or \"mean free path\" in materials. However, this complicates the calculation because the effective path length isn't fixed. But the problem states that the chamber has length $ l $, so perhaps it's assuming that the antiproton exits after traveling length $ l $ regardless of scatterings, which would be the case if the chamber is designed to let particles exit after traversing length $ l $, irrespective of their trajectory. For example, if the antiprotons are moving in a straight line and the chamber is a rectangular box, they exit after length $ l $. If they scatter, they might exit earlier or later, but the problem says \"leaving the bubble chamber,\" so maybe we have to assume that they do exit, and we are to find the probability that they have $ n $ elastic scatterings before exiting.\n\nThis is a different approach. Let's model it as follows: the antiproton enters the chamber and will eventually exit after some random time. The question is, what is the probability that it has exactly $ n $ elastic scatterings before exiting, and is not absorbed.\n\nBut how to model the exit? This seems more complex. Perhaps we can think of it as a race between exiting the chamber and being absorbed or scattered. However, without knowing the dynamics of how the antiproton moves after scattering, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the antiproton travels straight until it either exits or is absorbed. In this case, the probability of exiting without being absorbed is $ e^{-n_t \\sigma l} $, and the probability of being absorbed is $ 1 - e^{-n_t \\sigma l} $. If it is not absorbed, it has some number of elastic scatterings along the way. But how does the number of elastic scatterings relate?\n\nWait, if we assume that every interaction is either elastic or absorption, then the number of elastic scatterings is equal to the number of interactions minus the number of absorptions. But if it exits without being absorbed, then the number of absorptions is zero, so the number of elastic scatterings is equal to the number of interactions. Therefore, the probability of having exactly $ n $ elastic scatterings and exiting is the same as the probability of having exactly $ n $ interactions and all being elastic, which is what we calculated before: $ e^{-\\mu} \\frac{(\\mu \\sigma_e / \\sigma)^n}{n!} } $, with $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $.\n\nTherefore, this seems to be the answer, but again, it requires knowing $ \\mu $. Since the problem gives momentum $ p $, but we can't relate it to $ \\mu $, I'm stuck. Maybe the problem assumes that the antiprotons are not scattered at all, and the number of scatterings is zero? No, the question is about $ n $ scatterings.\n\nWait, maybe there is a standard formula in particle physics for this kind of probability. Let me recall that in radiation physics, the probability of a certain number of interactions is given by the Poisson distribution as above. If that's the case, and since the problem is from a textbook chapter that covers such topics, maybe the expected answer is indeed the Poisson probability $ e^{-\\mu} \\frac{(\\mu \\sigma_e / \\sigma)^n}{n!} } $, with $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $, and the problem expects this expression as the answer, even though $ n_t $ is not given. However, since the problem specifies the incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $, and since I can't find a way to relate it, perhaps it's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I need to express $ n_t $ in terms of the liquid hydrogen density, assuming standard values.\n\nBut since this is a theoretical problem, and not a numerical one, I think the expected answer is the expression I derived, with $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $, and since $ n_t $ is the number density of liquid hydrogen, which can be written as $ n_t = \\rho N_A / M $, where $ \\rho $ is the density of liquid hydrogen, $ N_A $ is Avogadro's number, and $ M $ is the molar mass. However, since these values are not provided, the problem might expect the answer in terms of $ n_t $, but the problem didn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the antiprotons interact only with protons in the liquid hydrogen, and since the number density of protons in liquid hydrogen is approximately equal to the number density of hydrogen atoms, and since liquid hydrogen is mostly protons (assuming it's hydrogen atoms), then $ n_t $ is the number of protons per unit volume. But again, without numerical values, we can't express it further.\n\nGiven that the problem gives the length $ l $ and the cross sections, and asks for the probability in terms of those and the momentum $ p $, and since I can't find a way to relate $ p $ to the number density, I think there must be an error in my reasoning. Let me try to look up similar problems.\n\nIn typical particle physics problems, when you have a beam going through a target, the probability of a certain number of interactions is given by the Poisson distribution as above. For example, the probability of no interactions is $ e^{-n_t \\sigma l} $, one interaction is $ e^{-n_t \\sigma l} n_t \\sigma l $, etc. If each interaction has a probability $ \\sigma_e / \\sigma $ of being elastic, then the probability of exactly $ n $ elastic interactions and no other interactions is $ e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!} $, as derived.\n\nTherefore, this must be the answer, and the mention of momentum $ p $ is either a red herring or there is additional context not provided. Since the problem specifies high-energy antiprotons, which implies that their path is approximately straight, and the cross sections are energy-independent, the momentum $ p $ might be there to indicate that we don't have to consider energy loss or multiple scattering effects, but it's not needed in the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n$ P(n) = e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!} $\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the probability in terms of the given quantities $ \\sigma_e $, $ \\sigma $, $ l $, and $ p $, and since $ n_t $ is not given, I must have missed something. Wait, perhaps the number density $ n_t $ can be related to the antiproton's momentum through the scattering? No, not directly. Wait, maybe in terms of the flux?\n\nThe flux $ \\Phi $ of the antiproton beam is $ n_b v $, where $ n_b $ is the number density of the beam and $ v $ is the velocity. However, the probability of interaction is independent of the beam flux. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that the antiprotons have a certain momentum, and thus their velocity is known, which allows us to calculate the time spent in the chamber, but as discussed earlier, this doesn't affect the number of interactions for a fixed length.\n\nWait, let me try to express $ n_t \\sigma l $ in terms of the antiproton's properties. If I consider the mean free path $ \\lambda = 1/(n_t \\sigma) $, then $ n_t \\sigma l = l / \\lambda $. But without knowing $ \\lambda $, this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that the antiproton is stopped in the chamber, but it says \"leaving the bubble chamber,\" so it's not stopped. \n\nGiven that I can't find a way to relate $ n_t $ to the given quantities, and since the problem is likely expecting the expression in terms of the provided symbols, I think that the correct answer is the Poisson probability as derived, and the mention of momentum is either extraneous or there is a missing piece of information. Therefore, I will proceed with the expression:\n\n$ P(n) = e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!} $\n\nBut since the problem mentions the incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $, and assuming that in a bubble chamber, the number density $ n_t $ is a fixed property of the material, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of $ \\sigma_e $, $ \\sigma $, $ l $, and $ p $, with the understanding that $ n_t $ is a known constant for liquid hydrogen. However, since it's not given, I might need to express $ n_t $ in terms of standard physical constants and properties of liquid hydrogen.\n\nAs an example, for liquid hydrogen, as I calculated earlier, $ n_t \\approx 4.215 \\times 10^{28} \\, \\text{m}^{-3} $. But since this is a theoretical problem, it's unlikely to expect such a numerical value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the antiprotons are interacting with the electrons in the liquid hydrogen? No, antiprotons are hadrons and interact primarily via the strong force with protons, not electrons.\n\nWait, another thought: In high-energy physics, the number of interactions can sometimes be related to the Glauber model or nuclear cross sections, but this seems too advanced for the current problem.\n\nGiven that I've spent a considerable amount of time on this and the most plausible answer is the Poisson probability expression, I will conclude that the probability is:\n\n$ P(n) = e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!} $\n\nHowever, since the problem specifies the incident momentum $ \\boldsymbol{p} $, and I have to include it somehow, perhaps there's a different approach where the momentum is used to calculate the number of scatterings?\n\nWait, here's a different idea. The mean free path $ \\lambda = 1/(n_t \\sigma) $. The number of mean free paths the antiproton travels is $ l / \\lambda = n_t \\sigma l = \\mu $. If we could express $ \\mu $ in terms of the antiproton's momentum, but how?\n\nIf the antiproton has a certain momentum, its velocity is $ v = p / \\gamma m $, where $ \\gamma $ is the Lorentz factor and $ m $ is the antiproton mass. However, the number of interactions is still $ \\mu = n_t \\sigma l $, which is independent of velocity. Therefore, no.\n\nUnless the length $ l $ is not the physical length, but the number of collisions? No, the problem says the chamber has length $ l $.\n\nGiven all this, I think the problem might have a typo, and the momentum $ p $ is not needed, or it's expected to leave the answer in terms of $ n_t $, which is a standard quantity for liquid hydrogen. Since in a real physics problem, $ n_t $ would be known for liquid hydrogen, perhaps the answer is as above, and the mention of $ p $ is just to specify the particle's energy regime (high-energy, so cross sections are energy-independent).\n\nTherefore, I'll box the expression I derived, noting that it's in terms of $ n_t $, but since the problem didn't provide it, it might expect this form.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is given by the Poisson distribution expression \\boxed{e^{-n_t \\sigma l} \\frac{(n_t \\sigma_e l)^n}{n!}}.\n</think>"}
