The question is asking which ionic equation correctly explains the given experimental phenomenon. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: Adding ammonium chloride to a suspension of magnesium hydroxide causes the precipitate to dissolve. The ionic equation given is Mg(OH)₂ + 2NH₄⁺ → Mg²⁺ + 2NH₃·H₂O. \n\nHmm, magnesium hydroxide is a sparingly soluble base. When you add ammonium chloride, which is a soluble salt providing NH₄⁺ ions, maybe there's a reaction. I remember that if you add a strong acid to magnesium hydroxide, it dissolves because H+ ions neutralize the OH- from Mg(OH)₂. But here, the acid is ammonium, which is a weak acid. Wait, NH₄+ is the conjugate acid of NH3. So maybe the NH4+ reacts with the OH- from Mg(OH)₂ to form NH3 and H2O. Since Mg(OH)₂ is a solid, the reaction would be Mg(OH)₂ + 2NH4+ → Mg²+ + 2NH3 + 2H2O. The equation given is similar, but it writes NH3·H2O instead of NH3 and H2O. Well, NH3 in water can form NH3·H2O. So maybe the equation is correct. The precipitate dissolves because Mg(OH)₂ is reacting with NH4+ to form soluble Mg²+ ions and ammonia. So option A seems plausible.\n\nNow option B: Adding saturated ferric chloride solution to boiling water results in a reddish-brown liquid. The ionic equation is Fe³+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)₃↓ + 3H+. \n\nWait, when you add FeCl3 to boiling water, I think this is a common way to make a colloidal solution of Fe(OH)3. The reaction is usually written as Fe³+ hydrolyzing in water. However, the equation here shows Fe(OH)3 precipitate forming. But in reality, if you heat it, you might get a colloidal solution rather than a precipitate. The arrow with the down symbol (↓) indicates a precipitate, but in the experiment, it's a reddish-brown liquid, which is a colloid. So maybe the equation isn't correct because it should form a colloid, not a precipitate. Also, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is usually reversible, especially in concentrated solutions. The equation given is written as a one-way reaction. Maybe under boiling conditions, the reaction proceeds more to form Fe(OH)3, but if it's a colloid, maybe the equation isn't accurately representing the product as a precipitate. So perhaps option B's equation is not correct. So B might be incorrect.\n\nOption C: Sulfur dioxide decolorizes acidic potassium permanganate solution. The equation is 3SO2 + 2MnO4⁻ + 4H+ → 3SO4²⁻ + 2Mn²+ + 2H2O. \n\nLet me check the redox reaction here. SO2 is a reducing agent, and MnO4⁻ is a strong oxidizing agent in acidic medium. The products would be sulfate ions (SO4²⁻) and Mn²+ ions. Let me balance the equation. \n\nFirst, the oxidation of SO2 to SO4²⁻. The sulfur in SO2 is +4, and in SO4²⁻ it's +6. So each SO2 loses 2 electrons. For 3 SO2, total electrons lost is 6. \n\nThe reduction of MnO4⁻ to Mn²+. Mn goes from +7 to +2, gaining 5 electrons per Mn. For 2 MnO4⁻, total electrons gained is 10. Wait, but the equation here has 2 Mn²+ on the product side. So 2 MnO4⁻ would gain 10 electrons. The oxidation side is 3 SO2 losing 6 electrons. These numbers don't match. So maybe the coefficients are wrong. Let me try balancing properly.\n\nLet me do the half-reactions. \n\nOxidation half-reaction: SO2 → SO4²⁻. \n\nIn acidic solution, add H2O and H+.\n\nSO2 + 2H2O → SO4²⁻ + 4H+ + 2e⁻ (each SO2 loses 2 electrons)\n\nReduction half-reaction: MnO4⁻ → Mn²+\n\nMnO4⁻ + 8H+ + 5e⁻ → Mn²+ + 4H2O (each Mn gains 5 electrons)\n\nTo balance electrons, multiply oxidation by 5 and reduction by 2:\n\nOxidation: 5SO2 + 10H2O → 5SO4²⁻ + 20H+ + 10e⁻\n\nReduction: 2MnO4⁻ + 16H+ + 10e⁻ → 2Mn²+ + 8H2O\n\nCombine:\n\n5SO2 + 10H2O + 2MnO4⁻ + 16H+ → 5SO4²⁻ + 20H+ + 2Mn²+ + 8H2O\n\nSimplify by subtracting 10H2O from both sides:\n\n5SO2 + 2MnO4⁻ + 16H+ → 5SO4²⁻ + 20H+ + 2Mn²+ + (8H2O - 10H2O) = -2H2O\n\nWait, maybe I should subtract H2O and H+ terms. Let me check:\n\nOn the left, after combining, we have 10H2O and 16H+.\n\nOn the right, we have 5SO4²⁻, 20H+, 2Mn²+, and 8H2O.\n\nSubtract 8H2O from both sides:\n\nLeft: 5SO2 + 2MnO4⁻ + 16H+ + 2H2O\n\nRight: 5SO4²⁻ + 20H+ + 2Mn²+\n\nThen subtract 16H+ from both sides:\n\nLeft: 5SO2 + 2MnO4⁻ + 2H2O\n\nRight: 5SO4²⁻ + 4H+ + 2Mn²+\n\nSo overall balanced equation is:\n\n5SO2 + 2MnO4⁻ + 2H2O → 5SO4²⁻ + 4H+ + 2Mn²+\n\nBut the equation given in option C is 3SO2 + 2MnO4⁻ + 4H+ → 3SO4²⁻ + 2Mn²+ + 2H2O. Comparing with the correct balanced equation, the coefficients are different. The correct coefficients should be 5 SO2 and 2 MnO4⁻, but the given equation uses 3 SO2 and 2 MnO4⁻. So the equation in option C is not balanced correctly. Therefore, the ionic equation provided is incorrect. Hence, option C is wrong.\n\nOption D: Ferrous oxide dissolves in dilute nitric acid. The equation is FeO + 2H+ → Fe²+ + H2O. \n\nBut wait, nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. FeO is Fe²+. When Fe²+ is dissolved in nitric acid, which is a strong oxidizer, the Fe²+ might be oxidized to Fe³+. However, the equation given assumes that FeO reacts with H+ to produce Fe²+ and water, which is correct if the acid is non-oxidizing. However, nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent, so in reality, the HNO3 would oxidize Fe²+ to Fe³+. Therefore, the correct ionic equation should include the oxidation of Fe²+ by nitrate ions. The given equation is incomplete because it ignores the oxidizing action of nitric acid. So option D's equation is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Let me check again. For option A, the reaction between Mg(OH)₂ and NH4Cl. Since NH4+ is a weak acid, it can react with the Mg(OH)₂ (a base) to form NH3 and water. The reaction is Mg(OH)₂ + 2NH4+ → Mg²+ + 2NH3 + 2H2O. The equation given is Mg(OH)₂ + 2NH4+ → Mg²+ + 2NH3·H2O. Since NH3·H2O is just a way of writing aqueous ammonia, which is in equilibrium with NH3 and H2O, so the equation is correct. The precipitate dissolves because Mg(OH)₂ is consumed, and the products are soluble (Mg²+ in solution and NH3·H2O). So A is correct. \n\nOptions B, C, D have issues. Therefore, the answer is A.\n</think>"}
