Oxygen is significantly more electronegative than nitrogen, and the double bond to oxygen creates a polar bond. The presence of different electronegativities and the asymmetry in the molecule (due to the single oxygen and three azide groups) result in a **polar molecule**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: The stereochemistry is tetrahedral**\n\nThis is **correct**.\n\nTo determine the geometry around the central phosphorus atom, we consider **VSEPR theory**. The phosphorus atom is bonded to four groups: one double-bonded oxygen and three single-bonded azide groups. In VSEPR theory, **each bond (single, double, or triple) is counted as one region of electron density**, and lone pairs are also counted.\n\n- The central phosphorus atom has **four regions of electron density**.\n- These include **one double bond to oxygen** and **three single bonds to azide groups**.\n- There are **no lone pairs** on phosphorus (as confirmed by formal charge calculations).\n- Therefore, the **electron geometry and molecular geometry** are both **tetrahedral**.\n\nThis makes **Option B** the correct statement regarding the **stereochemistry** of the molecule.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: It decomposes under heating and releases $\\mathrm{N}_2$**\n\nThis is **also correct**, based on **general chemical knowledge**.\n\nAzide groups ($\\mathrm{N}_3^-$) are well-known to **decompose upon heating**, producing **nitrogen gas ($\\mathrm{N}_2$)**.

The question is about phosphoryl trisazide, which has the formula O=P(N3)3. I need to figure out which of the four options is correct. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says it's a nonpolar molecule. Hmm. The molecule has a phosphorus atom bonded to an oxygen and three azide groups. Phosphorus usually has a trigonal pyramidal or tetrahedral geometry. But since there are three N3 groups and one O, the molecule might be symmetrical? Wait, but oxygen and azide have different electronegativities. Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen, so the P=O bond would be polar. The three N3 groups might be similar in terms of electron distribution, but the presence of the oxygen might make the molecule polar. So maybe option A is incorrect because the molecule is polar.\n\nOption B: The stereochemistry is tetrahedral. Let's think about the structure. Phosphorus in such compounds often has a tetrahedral geometry when it has four substituents. Here, the central phosphorus is bonded to one oxygen and three azide groups. So that's four substituents. If the geometry is tetrahedral, then yes. But wait, the bonding here: the oxygen is double-bonded to phosphorus. In a typical tetrahedral structure, like in phosphate esters, phosphorus has four single bonds. However, in this case, there's a double bond to oxygen. So maybe the geometry is not exactly tetrahedral? Or does the double bond count as one region of electron density? In VSEPR theory, double bonds are considered as one region. So if phosphorus has four regions of electron density (one double bond to O and three single bonds to N3), then the electron geometry would be tetrahedral. But the molecular geometry would also be tetrahedral since there are no lone pairs. Wait, phosphorus in such a case might have a lone pair? Let me recall. Phosphorus typically has five valence electrons. In this molecule, it's bonded to O and three N3. Let's count the bonds. The P is double-bonded to O (so that's 2 bonds?), and three single bonds to each N3. Wait, each N3 is a group. Let me think about the bonding. The azide group is N3⁻, so each is a single bond to P. The oxygen is double-bonded. So total bonds: 1 double bond (counts as one region) and three single bonds (each counts as one region). So total four regions. So the electron geometry is tetrahedral, and since there are no lone pairs (assuming all four bonds are used), the molecular geometry is also tetrahedral. Wait, but phosphorus in O=P(N3)3 would have how many valence electrons? Let's check. Phosphorus has 5 valence electrons. The double bond to O would be one bond, and three single bonds to N3. So total bonds: 1 double bond (which is two bonds in terms of bonding pairs?) Wait, maybe I need to count the bonding pairs. The double bond is one sigma and one pi bond. In terms of VSEPR, each bond (single, double, triple) is considered as one region. So for VSEPR, the double bond is one region. So P has four regions: one O (double bond) and three N3 (single bonds). Therefore, four regions, so tetrahedral geometry. So option B would be correct? But wait, sometimes when there's a double bond, the geometry can be different. For example, in SO2, which has a bent geometry because of double bonds. But here, since there are four regions, tetrahedral. So maybe B is correct. But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe there's a lone pair on phosphorus. Let me calculate. Phosphorus has 5 valence electrons. In O=P(N3)3, how many bonds is it involved in? The double bond to O is two bonds (but in terms of bonding pairs, it's one bond with two pairs?), maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try using the formula for VSEPR. The number of bonding pairs plus lone pairs around the central atom. For P, the number of bonding pairs is 4 (one to O and three to N3). The number of valence electrons on P is 5. The bonding pairs would be 4 (each bond is a pair). So total bonding electrons would be 4 * 2 = 8? Wait, maybe another approach. The total number of valence electrons around P. Let's see. P has 5. The O is double-bonded, so contributes two bonds (each bond is two electrons). Each N3 is a single bond, contributing one bond. So total bonds: double bond (2 bonds) + 3 single bonds (3 bonds) = 5 bonds. Each bond is two electrons, so total bonding electrons is 5 * 2 = 10. But P has 5 valence electrons. Wait, but in reality, the bonds would involve sharing electrons. Maybe I should use the formula for determining the number of lone pairs. The formula is L = (V - B)/2, where V is the number of valence electrons, B is the number of bonding electrons. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, for the central atom, the number of lone pairs is (total valence electrons - number of bonds * 2)/2. Wait, if P has 5 valence electrons. How many bonds is it making? Let's consider each bond as contributing one electron from P. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of formal charge. The formal charge on P would be: valence electrons (5) minus non-bonding electrons minus (bonding electrons / 2). Let's assume that in O=P(N3)3, the structure is such that P is double bonded to O and single bonded to each N3. Let's calculate formal charge. For P: Valence electrons = 5. Bonds: double bond to O (counts as 2 bonds?), and three single bonds to N3. Total bonds: 2 (for double bond) + 3 = 5 bonds. But each bond is two electrons, so total bonding electrons around P is 5 * 2 = 10. But formal charge is calculated as: Formal charge = Valence electrons - (non-bonding electrons + bonding electrons / 2). Assuming P has no lone pairs, then non-bonding electrons = 0. So formal charge would be 5 - (0 + 10 / 2) = 5 - 5 = 0. So formal charge is zero. That's possible. So if P has no lone pairs, then the geometry is tetrahedral. Therefore, option B is correct? But wait, if the central atom has four bonding pairs and no lone pairs, then the geometry is tetrahedral. So yes, option B would be correct. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The central atom P has four regions of electron density (one double bond and three single bonds), so four regions. Therefore, tetrahedral geometry. So option B is correct. But wait, what about the double bond? In reality, the geometry around a double bond can be different. Wait, no, in VSEPR theory, the regions are considered regardless of single, double, or triple bonds. So if there are four regions, it's tetrahedral. So option B is correct. So maybe B is correct. But let me check the other options to see if any of them are also correct.\n\nOption C: It decomposes under heating and releases N2. Well, azides (N3⁻) are known to release nitrogen gas when decomposed. For example, sodium azide is used in airbags to produce N2. So if this molecule has three azide groups, upon decomposition, it might release nitrogen gas. So option C could be correct. But I need to think if that's the case here. The decomposition of phosphoryl trisazide... I don't know the exact decomposition products, but if the azide groups break down, they would likely release N2. So maybe C is correct. So both B and C could be correct? Wait, but the options are single choice. Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. The question is which is correct. So need to check which is correct.\n\nOption D: The electronic formula of the decomposition product NPO is NMPP : O:. Wait, the notation is confusing. The decomposition product is NPO, and the electronic formula is given as NMPP : O:. Maybe that's a typo or shorthand. Assuming that NMPP is supposed to represent some structure? Maybe the question is referring to the Lewis structure of NPO. If NPO is a product, then maybe the Lewis structure has a triple bond or something? But the notation given here is unclear. The option says \"NMPP : O:\", which might be a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be a structure with a lone pair on oxygen? Not sure. Since I don't know the exact decomposition products, I can't be certain. But if the decomposition product is NPO, then the electronic formula... Well, without knowing what NMPP stands for, it's hard to evaluate. So perhaps D is incorrect.\n\nSo now, between B and C. Let me check again. The question is about the structure of phosphoryl trisazide. If the central P has four regions (tetrahedral), then B is correct. But wait, another thought: the molecule O=P(N3)3. The phosphorus is in a +5 oxidation state? Let's see. The azide is -1 each, and the oxygen is -2. So total charge: P + 3*(-1) + (-2) = 0. So P is +5. That makes sense. So the structure is P in +5 oxidation state, bonded to three N3⁻ and one O. So the structure is likely tetrahedral. So B is correct.\n\nBut then, option C says it decomposes under heating and releases N2. Since azides are known to decompose to N2, this is plausible. So why would C be incorrect? Or is it correct? The question is which is correct. So if both B and C are correct, but the options are A, B, C, D, but maybe only one is correct. Wait, the original question is in Chinese? Or maybe from a Chinese source. Let me think. Phosphoryl trisazide, when heated, would decompose. The azide groups can decompose into N2. So C is likely correct. So both B and C could be correct? But let me check if that's possible.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are (A) Nonpolar, (B) Tetrahedral stereochemistry, (C) Decomposes under heating and releases N2, (D) Electronic formula of decomposition product NPO is as given.\n\nIf both B and C are correct, but the options are single choice, then there might be a mistake. But maybe one of them is incorrect. Let me verify.\n\nFirst, the stereochemistry. If the central atom is P with four substituents (O and three N3), and no lone pairs, then yes, tetrahedral. But wait, in reality, phosphorus can have expanded octet. But with four bonds, even if one is a double bond, it's still four regions. So yes, tetrahedral. So B is correct.\n\nAs for C: azides decomposing to N2. Yes, for example, lead azide decomposes to N2. So phosphoryl trisazide would likely decompose similarly, releasing N2. So C is also correct. But if the options are only one correct answer, then maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, maybe the decomposition doesn't release N2. Let me think about the structure. The molecule is O=P(N3)3. If it decomposes, perhaps the azide groups break down. The azide group is -N3. Upon decomposition, each azide group could release N2. For example, each N3⁻ could break into N2 and N⁻? Or maybe multiple N2 molecules. Since each azide has three nitrogens, decomposing could give 1.5 N2 per azide? But in reality, decomposition of azides often leads to N2. For example, the thermal decomposition of organic azides can release N2. Inorganic azides like NaN3 also decompose to N2. So in this case, with three azide groups, heating would likely release N2. So C is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that both B and C might be correct. However, the options are given as single-choice. Let me check the original question again. The options are (A), (B), (C), (D). Maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, maybe the stereochemistry isn't tetrahedral. Let me think again. The central atom is P with four substituents: one O (double bond) and three N3 (single bonds). The VSEPR theory says that the geometry is determined by the number of electron regions. Since there are four regions (one double bond counts as one region), the electron geometry is tetrahedral. However, if there is a lone pair, then the geometry would be different. Earlier, I calculated that the formal charge on P is zero if there are no lone pairs. But maybe there is a lone pair. Let me recalculate.\n\nPhosphorus has 5 valence electrons. If it forms four bonds (one double bond and three single bonds), how many electrons are involved in bonding? The double bond has 4 electrons (2 from P?), and each single bond has 2 electrons. But in formal charge calculation, each bond is considered as contributing 1 electron from the atom. Wait, formal charge formula is: Formal charge = Valence electrons - (number of non-bonding electrons + ½ bonding electrons). Let's do that properly.\n\nAssuming P forms one double bond (which is 2 bonds, i.e., 4 electrons total) and three single bonds (each is 1 bond, 2 electrons). Total bonding electrons around P is 4 (from double bond) + 3*2 = 4 + 6 = 10 electrons. Wait, no, bonding electrons are the total electrons in bonds. Each bond has 2 electrons. The double bond has 4 electrons (two bonds), and three single bonds (each 2 electrons) have 6 electrons. Total bonding electrons is 4 + 6 = 10. So ½ of bonding electrons is 5. Non-bonding electrons on P: assuming no lone pairs, it's 0. So formal charge is 5 - (0 + 5) = 0. So formal charge is zero. So that's acceptable. Therefore, P has no lone pairs, so four bonding regions, tetrahedral geometry. So B is correct.\n\nBut then why would the question have both B and C as options? Maybe I need to check if C is correct. If the molecule decomposes and releases N2, then C is correct. Since azides are known to release N2 upon decomposition, C is likely correct. But if both B and C are correct, but the options are only one correct answer, then there's a problem. However, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decomposition doesn't release N2. For example, if the azide groups decompose into something else. But I don't know the specific decomposition products of phosphoryl trisazide. However, given that azides generally release N2, it's reasonable to assume C is correct. So if both B and C are correct, but the options are single-choice, there must be an error. But looking back, maybe one of them is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the stereochemistry isn't tetrahedral. Let me think about the hybridization. If the central P has four bonding regions and no lone pairs, it would be sp³ hybridized, leading to tetrahedral geometry. However, if the P has a double bond, which is a pi bond, does that affect the hybridization? The double bond consists of one sigma and one pi bond. The sigma bond is formed by sp³ hybrid orbitals, and the pi bond is formed by unhybridized p orbitals. So the geometry would still be tetrahedral. So B is correct.\n\nGiven that, both B and C seem correct. But since the options are A, B, C, D, and the question is from a test, it's possible that only one is correct. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating C. Let me think again. If the molecule is O=P(N3)3, upon heating, what would decompose? The azide groups could decompose. Each N3 group could release N2. For example, each N3⁻ could break down into N2 and N⁻. But maybe in the decomposition of phosphoryl trisazide, the products include N2. So C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decomposition produces other nitrogen compounds. But without specific knowledge, I have to rely on general knowledge that azides decompose to N2. Therefore, C is likely correct.\n\nBut if the options are only one correct, then perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but since that's not an option, I need to check again.\n\nWait, maybe option B is incorrect. Let me check the structure again. The molecule is O=P(N3)3. The phosphorus is bonded to one oxygen (double bond) and three azide groups. The azide groups are linear? Each N3⁻ is linear (like a straight line of three nitrogens). So the substituents around P are one O (double bond) and three linear N3 groups. If the geometry around P is tetrahedral, then the molecule is tetrahedral. However, if the double bond causes some distortion, but in VSEPR, it's still considered tetrahedral. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, both B and C are correct? But if the options are single-choice, perhaps the intended answer is B and C. But since the options are given as A, B, C, D, maybe the correct answer is B and C, but the question allows only one. However, this is unlikely. Perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option C is incorrect. For example, if the decomposition releases N2O or something else. But without specific knowledge, I can't be sure. Given that azides are known to release N2, I think C is correct.\n\nWait, the question is from a Chinese source, maybe the answer is B and C. But since the user provided options A to D, and the user is asking which is correct, and if I have to choose between B and C, I need to find which one is more certain.\n\nSince I can be more certain about the geometry (B) based on VSEPR theory, and less certain about the decomposition product (C), but given general knowledge about azides, C is also likely correct. However, in some cases, the decomposition of azides might not release pure N2. For example, sometimes they form other nitrogen compounds. But in the case of inorganic azides, like NaN3, it decomposes to N2 and Na. Similarly, phosphoryl trisazide might decompose to release N2 and other products like PO or something. So C is plausible.\n\nBut since the question is about which statement is correct, and both B and C could be correct, but if I have to choose one, perhaps the answer expects B and C. But since the options are separate, and in the original question it's possible that only one is correct, I need to check if there's any other consideration.\n\nLooking back at option D: The electronic formula of the decomposition product NPO is NMPP : O:. This notation is unclear. Maybe it's a typo. If NPO is a product, what's its structure? For example, NPO could be a molecule with N, P, and O. The electronic formula might involve a double bond or something. But without knowing what NMPP stands for, I can't evaluate D. So likely D is incorrect.\n\nSo between B and C. Given that the question is likely designed to have one correct answer, and considering that in some cases, the stereochemistry might not be tetrahedral. Wait, if the P has a double bond to O, maybe the geometry is trigonal planar? No, because there are four regions. Wait, no. If there are four regions, it's tetrahedral. Even if one of the bonds is a double bond. For example, in CH2O (formaldehyde), the central C has three regions (two single bonds to H, one double bond to O), leading to trigonal planar geometry. But here, P has four regions, so tetrahedral. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think both B and C are correct. But since the options are single-choice, perhaps there's a mistake in the question. However, given that the options are presented as single-choice, and if I have to choose between B and C, I need to see which one is more likely intended.\n\nIn some textbooks, the geometry of such a molecule might be considered tetrahedral, making B correct. The decomposition to release N2 is also likely, making C correct. However, if I have to choose based on the information given, and if the question is from a standard test, perhaps the correct answer is B and C. But since the options are separate, and the user is expecting one answer, maybe I need to look for more clues.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The molecule is O=P(N3)3. The central atom is phosphorus with four substituents. The azide groups are likely to be in a tetrahedral arrangement around P. So B is correct. As for C, since azides are known to release N2 upon decomposition, C is also correct. But if the options are only one correct, then perhaps the answer is B and C, but since that's not an option, maybe the intended answer is B. Alternatively, the question might have a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stereochemistry is not tetrahedral. Let me think about the hybridization again. If the central P has four bonding regions, it's sp³ hybridized, leading to tetrahedral geometry. So B is correct. Therefore, I think B is correct. However, if the decomposition to release N2 is a known fact, then C is also correct. But without specific knowledge of phosphoryl trisazide's decomposition, I have to rely on general knowledge of azides. Therefore, I think both B and C are correct. But since the options are separate, and in the absence of the ability to select multiple answers, I need to check if there's any other consideration.\n\nWait, maybe the molecule is polar, making A incorrect. B is correct. C is correct. D is incorrect. But if the question expects only one correct answer, perhaps the answer is B and C. However, since the options are given as single-choice, and the user has to choose one, maybe there's a mistake in the question. But since I have to choose between B and C, I'll go with B because it's a structural question and can be determined with certainty, while C is based on decomposition which might have exceptions.\n\nBut wait, in the absence of specific information about the decomposition, but given that azides generally release N2, I think C is more likely correct. Therefore, I'm torn between B and C. Given that, I'll have to make a decision based on what I know. Since azides are known to release N2 upon decomposition, and the question is about phosphoryl trisazide, which contains azide groups, I think C is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested B is correct. Maybe both are correct. However, if I have to choose one, and if the options are from a test where only one is correct, perhaps the intended answer is B. But I'm not sure. Given that, I'll need to make a choice. Given that the question is about the structure and properties, and both B and C could be correct, but if I have to choose, I'll go with B and C. But since the user expects one answer, and given that in some contexts decomposition might not be the focus, I'll go with B as the correct answer.\n</think>"}
