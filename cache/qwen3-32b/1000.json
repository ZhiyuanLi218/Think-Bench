In such a mechanism, the addition of the two bromine atoms occurs in a **trans** fashion, resulting in a single stereoisomer.

While unsymmetrical alkenes can form mixtures of stereoisomers, it is not a universal rule, and the product depends on the mechanism.\n\n- **B: A step-wise mechanism is involved, leading to a stable carbocation intermediate.**  \n  This is correct.

The question is about the bromination of 2-methoxybut-2-ene in carbon tetrachloride leading to a mixture of cis and trans-dihalides. The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the bromination of alkenes typically involves. Normally, when an alkene reacts with bromine (Br2), the reaction proceeds through a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate. This is a concerted mechanism where the Br-Br bond breaks and the two Br atoms add across the double bond in a trans fashion. So the product is usually a trans-dihalide. But in this case, there's a mixture of cis and trans. That's unusual.\n\nThe alkene in question is 2-methoxybut-2-ene. Let me draw its structure. The structure is CH2=C(CH2OCH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-methoxybut-2-ene. But-2-ene means the double bond is between C2 and C3 of a four-carbon chain. The methoxy group is at position 2. So the structure is CH2=C(OCH3)CH2CH3? Or maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the methoxy is on C2. So the molecule is CH2=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but but-2-ene would be CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2=C(CH2OCH3)CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe it's better to write it as CH2=C(OCH3)CH2CH3. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, the correct IUPAC name is 2-methoxybut-2-ene. The parent chain is but-2-ene, and the methoxy group is on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2OCH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, the but-2-ene is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure would be CH2=C(OCH3)CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps the methoxy is on the central carbon of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So the molecule is symmetric? Wait, but the double bond is between C2 and C3 of a four-carbon chain. The substituents on the double bond are a methoxy group (OCH3) on C2 and a CH2CH3 on C3? Wait, but if it's but-2-ene, then the structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure would be CH2=C(CH2OCH3)CH2CH3? No, that would be 2-methoxybut-2-ene. Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=C(OCH3)CH2CH3. Let me confirm. The parent hydrocarbon is but-2-ene, which is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. The substituents on the double bond are two groups: on C2, there's a methoxy group (OCH3) and on C3, there's a CH2CH3. But in but-2-ene, each carbon of the double bond has two substituents. Wait, but but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's but-1-ene. Wait, no. Let me get this right. The correct structure of but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that would be but-1-ene. But-2-ene would be CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, that's but-1-ene. But-2-ene is CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's but-1-ene. Wait, maybe I need to count the carbons. But-2-ene is a four-carbon chain with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the second and third carbons. So the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's CH2=CHCH2CH3, which is 1-pentene? No, wait, four carbons. Let me write it as CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, that's four carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So that's but-1-ene. But the question says but-2-ene. So but-2-ene would be CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(CH3)2? No, that's 2-methylpropane. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nBut-2-ene is a four-carbon chain with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that would have the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH3. Let me count the carbons. Carbon 1: CH2-, carbon 2: =CH-, carbon 3: CH2-, carbon 4: CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. That's but-1-ene. But-2-ene would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the molecule would be CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the second and third carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. Therefore, the correct structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's but-1-ene. But-2-ene would be CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's not right. Let me get this straight. The correct structure for but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's but-1-ene. Wait, no. Let me write the four-carbon chain as 1, 2, 3, 4. For but-2-ene, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the molecule is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. Therefore, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH3? No. Let me think. If the double bond is between C2 and C3, then the structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the molecule would be CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's not right. I'm getting stuck here. Let me look up the structure of but-2-ene. Oh wait, I can't do that, but I know that but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but-2-ene is CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's but-1-ene. Wait, but-2-ene is CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH3)2? No, that's 2-methylpropene. I'm confused. Let me try another approach. The correct structure for but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No. Wait, but-2-ene is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's but-1-ene. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH3? No. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The exact structure of the alkene isn't as important as understanding the mechanism of bromination and why a mixture of cis and trans products forms.\n\nThe question states that the bromination of 2-methoxybut-2-ene in carbon tetrachloride leads to a mixture of cis and trans-dihalides. Normally, bromination of alkenes via the bromonium ion intermediate gives trans addition. So if there's a mixture, that suggests that the mechanism isn't a single step, but maybe involves a carbocation intermediate, which allows for more flexibility in the addition.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA: Unsymmetrical alkenes always form a mixture of enantiomers.\n\nB: A step-wise mechanism is involved, leading to a stable carbocation intermediate.\n\nC: The transition state is in line with a concerted mechanism producing an intermediate bromonium ion.\n\nD: The transitional state is in line with a cyclic intermediate leading to a racemic mixture of products.\n\nSo, the usual bromination is a concerted mechanism (option C) forming a bromonium ion intermediate. But in this case, the product is a mixture of cis and trans. If the mechanism is step-wise with a carbocation intermediate (option B), then the addition of Br- could happen from either side of the carbocation, leading to both cis and trans products. So that would explain the mixture. The presence of a stable carbocation would favor a step-wise mechanism. So option B is likely the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, why would a stable carbocation form here? The alkene is 2-methoxybut-2-ene. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group, which can stabilize a carbocation. If the alkene is symmetrical, the carbocation would be more stable. Let me think. The structure of 2-methoxybut-2-ene is CH2=C(OCH3)CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(OCH3)CH2CH3? Or perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the methoxy is on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(OCH3)CH2CH3? In that case, when the alkene reacts with Br2, the carbocation formed would be on the more substituted carbon. Let me imagine the addition of Br2. If the mechanism is via a bromonium ion (concerted), then the addition is trans. But if it goes through a carbocation, then the Br- can attack from either side, leading to both cis and trans. The presence of a stable carbocation would favor the step-wise mechanism. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group (due to resonance and inductive effects?), which could stabilize a carbocation if it's adjacent. In this case, the methoxy is on the same carbon as the double bond? Let me think. If the structure is CH2=C(OCH3)CH2CH3, then the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the methoxy on C2. The carbocation formed would be on C2 or C3. Since the double bond is between C2 and C3, the carbocation could be on either. The methoxy group is on C2. If the carbocation is on C2, then the methoxy group is adjacent and can stabilize it via resonance. Methoxy is an electron-donating group (due to resonance), so it can stabilize a carbocation. Therefore, the step-wise mechanism would be favored here, leading to a carbocation intermediate. This would allow the bromide ion to attack from either side, leading to both cis and trans addition. Hence, the product is a mixture. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nOption C says the transition state is in line with a concerted mechanism producing a bromonium ion. But if that were the case, we'd expect trans addition, not a mixture. So C is incorrect. Option D mentions a cyclic intermediate leading to a racemic mixture. A cyclic intermediate would be the bromonium ion, which would lead to trans addition. But a racemic mixture would imply equal amounts of enantiomers, which is different from a mixture of cis and trans. So D is not the right explanation. Option A is incorrect because unsymmetrical alkenes don't always form enantiomers; the product depends on the mechanism. So the correct answer is B.\n</think>"}
