The charge on the capacitor is:\n   $$\n   Q = CV\n   $$\n   If $ C $ decreases due to the removal of the dielectric, then $ Q $ must also decrease (as $ V $ is constant).\n\n3. **Electric Field Between the Plates**:\n   The electric field in a parallel plate capacitor is:\n   $$\n   E = \\frac{V}{d}\n   $$\n   Since $ V $ is constant and $ d $ (the physical separation) remains unchanged, the electric field $ E $ also remains constant.\n\n   Alternatively, using the relation $ E = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0} $, where $ \\sigma = \\frac{Q}{A} $, the decrease in $ Q $ is exactly offset by the removal of the dielectric's influence, ensuring $ E $ remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Charge on the plates decreases** because the capacitance decreases while the voltage is held constant.\n- **Electric field remains unchanged** because it depends only on the voltage and plate separation, which are constant.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about a parallel plate capacitor filled with mica dielectric connected to a constant voltage DC power supply. If the mica is removed, what happens to the charge on the plates and the electric field intensity?\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas related to capacitors. The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with a dielectric is C = ε₀ε_r * A / d, where ε_r is the dielectric constant. When the dielectric is removed, ε_r becomes 1 (since air has a dielectric constant close to 1), so the capacitance would decrease.\n\nSince the capacitor is connected to a constant voltage supply, the voltage V across the capacitor remains constant. The charge on the capacitor is Q = C*V. If the capacitance decreases when the dielectric is removed, then the charge Q must also decrease because V is constant. So the charge on the plates decreases.\n\nNow, the electric field E in a parallel plate capacitor is given by E = V/d, where d is the distance between the plates. Since the voltage V is constant and the distance d doesn't change (only the dielectric is removed), the electric field E should remain the same. Alternatively, another formula for E is E = σ/(ε₀ε_r), where σ is the charge per unit area. If the dielectric is removed, ε_r becomes 1. However, since the charge Q decreases (as we established), σ would also decrease. So E = (Q/A)/(ε₀*1) = Q/(Aε₀). But originally, with the dielectric, E was Q/(Aε₀ε_r). Since Q decreases by a factor of ε_r (because C was proportional to ε_r and Q=C*V), the decrease in Q would offset the decrease in ε_r. Let me check that again.\n\nOriginal Q with dielectric: Q1 = C1*V = (ε_r * ε₀ A / d) * V\n\nAfter removing dielectric, Q2 = C2 * V = (ε₀ A / d) * V. So Q2 = Q1 / ε_r. So the charge decreases by a factor of ε_r.\n\nOriginal electric field with dielectric: E1 = V/d. Because electric field in a capacitor is V/d regardless of dielectric? Wait, no. Wait, another formula is E = σ/(ε₀ε_r). Let me check.\n\nThe electric field without dielectric is E0 = σ/ε₀. With dielectric, the electric field is E = E0 / ε_r = σ/(ε₀ε_r). But σ is Q/A. So with dielectric, E1 = (Q1/A) / (ε₀ ε_r). But Q1 = ε_r ε₀ A V / d. So substituting:\n\nE1 = ( (ε_r ε₀ A V / d ) / A ) / (ε₀ ε_r ) ) = ( ε_r ε₀ V / d ) / ( ε₀ ε_r ) ) = V/d. So E1 is V/d.\n\nAfter removing dielectric, Q2 = ε₀ A V / d. Then σ2 = Q2/A = ε₀ V / d. The electric field E2 = σ2 / ε₀ = (ε₀ V / d ) / ε₀ = V/d. So E2 is also V/d. Therefore, the electric field remains the same even after removing the dielectric.\n\nTherefore, the charge on the plates decreases (since Q2 = Q1 / ε_r) and the electric field remains unchanged. So looking at the options, that's option D: The amount of charge on the plates decreases, the electric field intensity between the plates remains unchanged.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) Charge increases, E increases\n\nB) Charge decreases, E increases\n\nC) Charge increases, E same\n\nD) Charge decreases, E same.\n\nSo the correct answer is D. Therefore, the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
