The problem says that half the value of 3x minus 9 is equal to x plus 37. I need to find the value of x. Hmm, let me try to write that down as an equation first. \n\nSo, half of (3x - 9) equals x + 37. In math terms, that would be (1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37. Alright, now I need to solve for x. Let me remember how to solve linear equations. First, maybe I should get rid of the fraction to make it simpler. To do that, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 2. Let me try that.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2: 2*(1/2)*(3x - 9) = 2*(x + 37). On the left side, the 2 and 1/2 should cancel each other out, leaving just 3x - 9. On the right side, I need to distribute the 2 into both terms inside the parentheses. So that would be 2*x + 2*37, which is 2x + 74. \n\nSo now the equation is 3x - 9 = 2x + 74. Okay, now I need to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let me subtract 2x from both sides to get rid of the 2x on the right. \n\nSubtracting 2x: 3x - 2x - 9 = 74. That simplifies to x - 9 = 74. Now, to isolate x, I need to add 9 to both sides. \n\nAdding 9: x - 9 + 9 = 74 + 9. Which simplifies to x = 83. Wait, is that right? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOriginal equation: (1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37. Multiply both sides by 2: 3x - 9 = 2x + 74. Subtract 2x: x - 9 = 74. Add 9: x = 83. Seems straightforward. Let me plug it back into the original equation to verify. \n\nLeft side: (1/2)(3*83 - 9). Let me compute 3*83 first. 3*80 is 240, 3*3 is 9, so total is 249. Then subtract 9: 249 - 9 = 240. Then half of that is 120. \n\nRight side: 83 + 37. Let me add those. 80 + 30 is 110, 3 + 7 is 10, so total is 120. Okay, both sides equal 120 when x is 83. That checks out. So x must be 83. \n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Sometimes when solving equations, especially with fractions, it's easy to miscalculate. Let me go through the substitution step again. \n\nOriginal equation: half of (3x - 9) equals x + 37. If x is 83, then 3x is 249. 249 minus 9 is 240. Half of 240 is indeed 120. On the other side, x + 37 is 83 + 37. Let me do that addition again. 83 + 37. 80 + 30 is 110, 3 + 7 is 10, so 110 + 10 is 120. Yep, same result. So both sides are equal. \n\nTherefore, my answer seems correct. Maybe I was just being cautious because sometimes when you move terms around, signs can get messed up, but in this case, everything seems to line up. \n\nAlternatively, let me try solving the equation another way, just to confirm. Starting again with (1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37. Instead of multiplying both sides by 2 first, maybe distribute the 1/2. \n\nSo, (1/2)*3x is (3/2)x, and (1/2)*(-9) is -9/2. So the equation becomes (3/2)x - 9/2 = x + 37. Now, let me subtract x from both sides to get (3/2)x - x - 9/2 = 37. \n\nCalculating (3/2)x - x: that's (3/2 - 2/2)x = (1/2)x. So now the equation is (1/2)x - 9/2 = 37. Then, add 9/2 to both sides: (1/2)x = 37 + 9/2. \n\nConvert 37 to halves: 37 is 74/2, so 74/2 + 9/2 = 83/2. Therefore, (1/2)x = 83/2. Multiply both sides by 2: x = 83. Same result. \n\nOkay, so both methods lead me to x = 83. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. \n\nAnother check: let's consider the original problem statement again. \"Half the value of 3x - 9 is x + 37.\" So if half of something is another value, then that something should be twice the other value. So 3x - 9 should equal 2*(x + 37). Which is exactly what I did first by multiplying both sides by 2. And solving that gives the same result. \n\nSo all methods converge to x = 83, and substitution back into the original equation confirms that both sides are equal. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Maybe I can think if there's a possibility of another solution or if the equation is linear so only one solution exists. Since it's a first-degree equation, there should be only one solution, which is 83. \n\nTherefore, I think the value of x is 83.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ x $ is \\boxed{83}.\n</think>"}
