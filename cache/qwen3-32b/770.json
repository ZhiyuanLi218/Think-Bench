Let me start by recalling what I know about reaction mechanisms and rate laws. \n\nThe problem gives me two steps: the first is the slow step, and the second is the fast step. The overall reaction is probably the sum of these two steps. Let me write them down:\n\n1. NO₂ + F₂ → NO₂F + F (slow)\n2. F + NO₂ → NO₂F (fast)\n\nAdding these two steps together, the intermediate F should cancel out. Let me check that:\n\nNO₂ + F₂ + F + NO₂ → NO₂F + F + NO₂F\n\nWait, combining the left sides: NO₂, F₂, F, and another NO₂. The right side is two NO₂F and an F. Wait, the F on the right cancels with the F on the left. So combining, the overall reaction would be:\n\nNO₂ + F₂ + NO₂ → 2 NO₂F\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 NO₂ + F₂ → 2 NO₂F\n\nSo the overall reaction is 2 NO₂ + F₂ → 2 NO₂F. But the question is about the order of the reaction. The order is determined by the rate-determining step, which is the slow step. Wait, but I need to remember that the rate law for the overall reaction depends on the slow step, but if there are intermediates involved, I might have to express the rate law in terms of the reactants only.\n\nThe slow step is the rate-determining step, so the rate law for the overall reaction is the same as the rate law for the slow step. However, if the slow step contains intermediates, I need to express them in terms of the concentrations of the reactants from the overall reaction.\n\nLooking at the slow step: NO₂ + F₂ → NO₂F + F. The rate law for this step would be rate = k [NO₂]^m [F₂]^n, where m and n are the orders with respect to NO₂ and F₂. Since it's an elementary step (assuming the mechanism is correct as given), the order is determined by the stoichiometric coefficients. So the rate law would be rate = k [NO₂][F₂]. \n\nBut wait, is there any intermediate in this rate law? The slow step's rate law only involves NO₂ and F₂, which are both reactants in the overall reaction. The product of the slow step is NO₂F and F, but F is an intermediate because it's consumed in the next step. However, since the rate law for the slow step doesn't include F (it's a product of the slow step, not a reactant), there's no intermediate in the rate law of the slow step. Therefore, the rate law is simply first order in NO₂ and first order in F₂, making the overall reaction second order? Wait, no. Wait, first order in each would make it second order overall. But let me double-check.\n\nThe slow step is bimolecular: one NO₂ and one F₂ molecule collide. So the rate law is first order in NO₂ and first order in F₂. So overall, the rate law is second order (1 + 1). Therefore, the overall reaction is second order. But wait, the answer options are zero, first, second, third. So is the answer C: Second order?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Is there any possibility that the fast step affects the rate law? The general rule is that the rate-determining step (slow step) determines the overall rate law. However, if the slow step has intermediates in its rate law, we need to use the steady-state approximation or something else to express the rate law in terms of reactants. But in this case, the slow step doesn't have any intermediates in its rate law. The F is a product of the slow step, not a reactant, so it's not part of the rate law for the slow step. Therefore, the rate law is directly rate = k [NO₂][F₂], which is second order overall. \n\nBut let me check the overall reaction again. The overall reaction is 2 NO₂ + F₂ → 2 NO₂F. If the rate law was based on the overall reaction (which it's not, because reaction order is determined experimentally and depends on the mechanism), but if someone mistakenly thought it's based on stoichiometry, they might say it's third order (2 + 1 = 3), but that's not correct. The actual rate law comes from the mechanism.\n\nSo since the rate-determining step is the slow step, which is first order in NO₂ and first order in F₂, the overall reaction is second order. Therefore, the answer is C: Second order.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the first step is slow and the second is fast. The fast step might be in equilibrium? No, because the fast step follows the slow step. The steady-state approximation is usually applied to intermediates. But here, since the rate law for the slow step doesn't involve any intermediates, we don't need to do anything else. The rate law is simply based on the slow step.\n\nTherefore, the overall reaction order is 1 + 1 = 2, so second order. Answer C.\n</think>"}
