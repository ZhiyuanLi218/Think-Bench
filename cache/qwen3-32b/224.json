So, we have a sample of pure Caesium-137 with 10^17 atoms, and we need to find out how many gamma-rays are detected by a detector placed 4 meters away after 80 minutes. The detector is a perfect gamma-ray detector with a size of 2x3 cm and it's facing the material directly. The answer choices are given, so I need to calculate the correct number.\n\nFirst, I remember that the activity of a radioactive substance is related to the number of atoms and the decay constant. The formula for activity is A = λN, where λ is the decay constant and N is the number of atoms. But since the sample is pure Caesium-137, we need to consider its half-life. Let me recall the half-life of Cs-137. I think it's about 30 years. Wait, 30 years is a long time, so in 80 minutes, the decay might not be significant? But maybe I should check the exact half-life. Let me confirm: the half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30.17 years. Yes, that's correct. So 80 minutes is much shorter than the half-life, so the number of atoms that decay in that time is small, so maybe we can approximate that the number of atoms N remains roughly 10^17 during the 80 minutes. But I should still check if the decay is significant enough to affect the activity. Let me think about that later.\n\nBut first, let's get back to the activity. Activity is the number of decays per second. But since Cs-137 has a long half-life, the decay constant λ is small. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life T1/2 by λ = ln(2)/T1/2. Let me calculate λ.\n\nFirst, convert the half-life from years to seconds. 30.17 years is approximately 30 years. Let's convert 30 years to seconds. 1 year is 365 days, 1 day is 24 hours, 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So:\n\n30 years * 365 days/year * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour. Let me compute that:\n\n30 * 365 = 10,950 days\n10,950 days * 24 hours/day = 262,800 hours\n262,800 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 946,080,000 seconds. Approximately 9.46 x 10^8 seconds.\n\nSo λ = ln(2)/T1/2 ≈ 0.693 / 9.46 x 10^8 s ≈ 7.33 x 10^-10 s^-1.\n\nThen, the activity A = λN. N is 10^17 atoms.\n\nSo A ≈ 7.33 x 10^-10 s^-1 * 10^17 = 7.33 x 10^7 decays per second. So about 7.33 x 10^7 Bq (Becquerels).\n\nBut wait, Cs-137 doesn't emit gamma-rays directly on decay. I think Cs-137 decays by beta decay to Barium-137m, which is a metastable state. Then Barium-137m decays to stable Barium-137 by emitting a gamma-ray. So each decay of Cs-137 eventually leads to a gamma-ray emission. However, the time between the beta decay and the gamma emission is very short, so for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that each decay of Cs-137 results in one gamma-ray. So the activity in terms of gamma-rays would be approximately the same as the activity of the Cs-137 sample.\n\nBut let me confirm: Cs-137 has a half-life of 30.17 years and decays by beta decay (β−) to metastable Barium-137 (Ba-137m), which then decays with a half-life of about 2.55 minutes by gamma emission to stable Ba-137. So, the gamma-ray emission is from the daughter isotope, but since the half-life of Ba-137m is much shorter than the time we are considering (80 minutes), which is longer than the half-life of the daughter isotope, we need to consider whether all the Ba-137m has decayed by the time we measure the gamma-rays. Wait, the problem says that we are measuring the activity after 80 minutes. So, the initial Cs-137 decays, producing Ba-137m, which then decays. Since the half-life of Ba-137m is 2.55 minutes, after 80 minutes, which is about 31.4 half-lives (80 / 2.55 ≈ 31.4), the amount of Ba-137m would have decayed almost completely. Therefore, the number of gamma-rays emitted would be approximately equal to the number of Cs-137 decays that occurred during the 80 minutes. However, the problem is phrased as \"activity is being measured\" after 80 minutes. Wait, activity is the number of decays per unit time. But if we are measuring the gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes, perhaps we need to calculate the total number of gamma-rays emitted over the 80 minutes, and then determine how many of those are detected by the detector.\n\nWait, the problem says \"after 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?\" So it's the total number detected during the 80 minutes? Or is the activity measured at the 80-minute mark? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But given that it's asking for the number detected after 80 minutes, I think it's the total number of gamma-rays emitted during the 80 minutes that are detected.\n\nSo first, calculate the number of decays (and thus gamma-rays emitted) in 80 minutes, then calculate how many of those are detected by the detector.\n\nBut first, let's check if the decay of Cs-137 is significant over 80 minutes. Since the half-life is 30 years, which is about 30*365*24*3600 ≈ 9.46 x 10^8 seconds, as we calculated earlier. The time given is 80 minutes, which is 80*60 = 4800 seconds. The number of half-lives elapsed is t / T1/2 = 4800 / 9.46 x 10^8 ≈ 5.07 x 10^-6. So it's negligible. Therefore, the number of atoms remaining is approximately N0 * e^(-λt) ≈ N0 * (1 - λt). So the number of decays is approximately N0 * λt, since λt is very small. Therefore, the number of decays in time t is approximately A0 * t, where A0 is the initial activity. So, the number of gamma-rays emitted is approximately A0 * t.\n\nSo let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, A0 = λN0 ≈ 7.33 x 10^7 decays per second, as calculated earlier.\n\nt is 80 minutes = 80 * 60 = 4800 seconds.\n\nTotal decays (and thus gamma-rays emitted) ≈ A0 * t = 7.33 x 10^7 * 4800 ≈ let's compute that.\n\n7.33 x 10^7 * 4.8 x 10^3 = 7.33 * 4.8 x 10^(7+3) = 35.184 x 10^10 ≈ 3.5184 x 10^11 gamma-rays emitted.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a huge number. But given that the initial number of atoms is 10^17, and the activity is 7.33 x 10^7 Bq, over 4800 seconds, that would be 7.33e7 * 4.8e3 ≈ 3.5e11. But that's the total number of gamma-rays emitted. Now, we need to find how many of those are detected by the detector.\n\nTo calculate the number detected, we need to consider the solid angle subtended by the detector at the source, and the efficiency of the detector. Since the detector is perfect, it detects every gamma-ray that hits it. So the number detected is the total emitted multiplied by the solid angle of the detector divided by 4π (assuming isotropic emission), multiplied by the detection efficiency (which is 100% here).\n\nSo the formula would be N_detected = N_emitted * (Ω / 4π) * ε, where ε is 1 (perfect detector), and Ω is the solid angle.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the solid angle Ω. The solid angle subtended by an area A at a distance r is approximately A / r², if A is much smaller than r². The detector is 2x3 cm = 6 cm² = 6 x 10^-4 m². The distance r is 4 meters.\n\nSo Ω ≈ A / r² = (6 x 10^-4 m²) / (4 m)^2 = 6 x 10^-4 / 16 = 3.75 x 10^-5 steradians.\n\nAlternatively, the exact formula for a rectangular detector is more complex, but since the detector is small compared to the distance, the approximation is acceptable.\n\nSo Ω ≈ 3.75 x 10^-5 sr.\n\nThen, N_detected ≈ 3.5 x 10^11 * (3.75 x 10^-5) / (4π) * 1.\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, calculate 3.75 x 10^-5 / 4π ≈ 3.75 x 10^-5 / 12.566 ≈ 2.98 x 10^-6.\n\nThen multiply by 3.5 x 10^11:\n\n3.5 x 10^11 * 2.98 x 10^-6 ≈ 1.043 x 10^6.\n\nSo approximately 1 million gamma-rays detected. Which is option B: 1 million (10^6). So the answer should be B.\n\nBut let me check my steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, activity calculation:\n\nλ = ln(2)/T1/2. T1/2 is 30 years. Converting to seconds: 30*365*24*3600 ≈ 9.46 x 10^8 seconds. So λ ≈ 0.693 / 9.46e8 ≈ 7.33e-10 s^-1. Correct.\n\nN = 1e17 atoms. So A = 7.33e-10 * 1e17 = 7.33e7 decays per second. Correct.\n\nt = 80 minutes = 4800 seconds. Total decays ≈ A*t = 7.33e7 * 4.8e3 ≈ 3.5e11. Correct.\n\nSolid angle: detector area is 2cm x 3cm = 6 cm² = 6e-4 m². Distance 4 meters. So Ω ≈ 6e-4 / (4^2) = 6e-4 / 16 = 3.75e-5 sr. Correct.\n\nThen N_detected ≈ 3.5e11 * 3.75e-5 / (4π). Wait, why divide by 4π? Because the gamma-rays are emitted isotropically, so the solid angle is divided by the total solid angle around the source (4π steradians). So the fraction of gamma-rays going into the detector is Ω / (4π). So that's correct.\n\nSo 3.75e-5 / 4π ≈ 3.75e-5 / 12.566 ≈ 2.98e-6.\n\nMultiply by 3.5e11: 3.5e11 * 2.98e-6 ≈ 1.043e6. So approximately 1 million. Which is option B. So the answer is B.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factors I might have missed. For example, the gamma-ray emission probability. Wait, does Cs-137 emit one gamma-ray per decay? Or is there a branching ratio?\n\nWait, Cs-137 decays by beta decay to Ba-137m, which then decays by gamma emission. The beta decay happens, and then the Ba-137m decays. The gamma emission is from the Ba-137m. But since the half-life of Ba-137m is 2.55 minutes, which is much shorter than the 80 minutes, the gamma emission is almost complete. However, each beta decay of Cs-137 leads to one Ba-137m, which then decays to Ba-137 with a gamma emission. So the gamma emission is 100% of the Cs-137 decays? Or is there a branching ratio?\n\nI need to check the decay scheme. Cs-137 has a decay chain: Cs-137 (beta- to Ba-137m) which then decays (gamma to Ba-137). The gamma emission from Ba-137m is almost 100% probable. The National Nuclear Data Center or other sources say that the gamma-ray emission probability for Ba-137m is nearly 100%. For example, the gamma-ray emission probability is about 94.4% for the 662 keV gamma-ray. Wait, maybe I should check the exact value. Let me recall: the decay of Ba-137m is almost 100% by gamma emission. The branching ratio for gamma emission is close to 100%. Let me confirm: Ba-137m has a very short half-life (2.55 minutes) and decays almost entirely by gamma emission. The beta decay of Cs-137 to Ba-137m has a 100% branching ratio, and then Ba-137m decays with a gamma emission probability of about 94.4% (I remember this from memory; the exact value might be 94.4% for the 662 keV gamma). Therefore, if we are considering all gamma-rays, then each Cs-137 decay would lead to a gamma-ray with probability 94.4%. But the problem says \"pure Caesium-137\" and \"gamma-rays\" in general. If the question is considering all gamma-rays emitted from the decay chain, then we need to multiply by 0.944. However, the problem states \"a perfect detector for gamma-rays\", so perhaps it's assuming that every decay results in a gamma-ray, but in reality, there's a 94.4% probability. However, since the problem does not mention this, and given that the answer options are rough estimates, maybe we can assume 100% for simplicity. However, if we use 94.4%, then the number would be 0.944 * 1e6 ≈ 9.44e5, which is still approximately 1 million. So the answer remains B. Therefore, even if we consider the 94.4%, it's still close to 1 million, so the answer is B.\n\nAnother thing to check: the solid angle calculation. The detector is 2x3 cm = 6 cm². The distance is 4 meters. So the area is 6e-4 m². The solid angle is A / r² = 6e-4 / (4^2) = 6e-4 / 16 = 3.75e-5 sr. Correct. Then divide by 4π to get the fraction. Correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake: the time. Did I convert 80 minutes correctly? 80 * 60 = 4800 seconds. Correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake: the number of decays. Since the time is short compared to the half-life, the number of decays is A0 * t. Correct. Because N(t) = N0 e^(-λt) ≈ N0 (1 - λt), so the number of decays is N0 - N(t) ≈ N0 λt = A0 t. Correct.\n\nSo all steps seem correct, leading to approximately 1 million gamma-rays detected, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
