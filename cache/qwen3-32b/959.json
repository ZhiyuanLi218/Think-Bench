Hmm, I remember there's a formula that relates wavelength and frequency. Let me think... Oh right, it's the speed of light equation. The speed of light (c) is equal to the wavelength (λ) multiplied by the frequency (f). So the formula is c = λf. \n\nAlright, so if I want to find the frequency, I can rearrange that formula to solve for f. That would be f = c / λ. The speed of light is a constant, right? I think it's approximately 3 × 10^8 meters per second. Let me confirm that... Yeah, I think that's right. 3.00 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: f = (3 × 10^8 m/s) divided by (6 × 10^-8 m). Let me do that calculation. First, divide 3 by 6, which is 0.5. Then, for the exponents of 10, 10^8 divided by 10^-8 is 10^(8 - (-8)) = 10^16. So putting that together, 0.5 × 10^16 Hz. Wait, but 0.5 × 10^16 is the same as 5 × 10^15 Hz. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option A is 5 × 10^15 Hz. That seems to match. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The formula is correct, c = λf. The speed of light is indeed about 3e8 m/s. Dividing 3e8 by 6e-8 gives (3/6) = 0.5 and 10^8 / 10^-8 = 10^(16). So 0.5e16 is 5e15. Yep, that looks right. \n\nThe other options are way off. 0.5 Hz is super low, like once every two seconds. 2 Hz is twice a second, which is still extremely low for light. 20 Hz is even higher but still in the audio range, which doesn't make sense for UV light. So the only reasonable answer is A.\n</think>"}
