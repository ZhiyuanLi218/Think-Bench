Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. log base 8 of a plus log base 4 of b squared equals 5.\n2. log base 8 of b plus log base 4 of a squared equals 7.\n\nHmm, so the equations are:\n\nlog₈a + log₄(b²) = 5\n\nand\n\nlog₈b + log₄(a²) = 7.\n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms with different bases can sometimes be converted to the same base using the change of base formula. Maybe I can convert both logarithms in each equation to the same base so that I can combine them or solve for variables more easily.\n\nLet me recall the change of base formula: log_c(d) = log_k(d) / log_k(c), where k is any positive number. So, maybe I can convert all logs to base 2 since 8 and 4 are both powers of 2. That might simplify things.\n\nLet me try that. Let's start with the first equation: log₈a + log₄(b²) = 5.\n\nFirst, convert log base 8 of a to base 2. Since 8 is 2³, log₈a is equal to (log₂a) / log₂8 = (log₂a)/3.\n\nSimilarly, log base 4 of b². Since 4 is 2², log₄(b²) is equal to (log₂(b²)) / log₂4 = (2 log₂b)/2 = log₂b.\n\nSo, substituting back into the first equation:\n\n(log₂a)/3 + log₂b = 5.\n\nSimilarly, let me do the same for the second equation: log₈b + log₄(a²) = 7.\n\nAgain, log₈b is (log₂b)/3, and log₄(a²) is (log₂(a²))/log₂4 = (2 log₂a)/2 = log₂a.\n\nTherefore, the second equation becomes:\n\n(log₂b)/3 + log₂a = 7.\n\nSo now, the system of equations is simplified to:\n\n1. (log₂a)/3 + log₂b = 5.\n\n2. (log₂b)/3 + log₂a = 7.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me denote x = log₂a and y = log₂b. Then the equations become:\n\n1. (x)/3 + y = 5.\n\n2. (y)/3 + x = 7.\n\nSo now we have a system of linear equations in x and y. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: (1/3)x + y = 5.\n\nEquation 2: x + (1/3)y = 7.\n\nAlright, so solving for x and y. Let me write them as:\n\n(1) (1/3)x + y = 5.\n\n(2) x + (1/3)y = 7.\n\nI can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.\n\nFirst, maybe multiply both equations by 3 to eliminate denominators.\n\nMultiplying equation (1) by 3:\n\n3*(1/3)x + 3*y = 3*5 => x + 3y = 15. Let's call this equation (1a).\n\nMultiplying equation (2) by 3:\n\n3*x + 3*(1/3)y = 3*7 => 3x + y = 21. Let's call this equation (2a).\n\nSo now we have:\n\n(1a) x + 3y = 15.\n\n(2a) 3x + y = 21.\n\nNow, let me solve this system. Let me use elimination again. Let's multiply equation (1a) by 3:\n\n3x + 9y = 45. Let's call this equation (1b).\n\nThen subtract equation (2a) from equation (1b):\n\n(3x + 9y) - (3x + y) = 45 - 21 => 3x + 9y - 3x - y = 24 => 8y = 24 => y = 3.\n\nThen, substitute y = 3 back into equation (1a): x + 3*3 = 15 => x + 9 = 15 => x = 6.\n\nSo x = 6 and y = 3. Remember that x = log₂a and y = log₂b. Therefore:\n\nlog₂a = 6 => a = 2^6 = 64.\n\nlog₂b = 3 => b = 2^3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, ab = 64 * 8. Let me calculate that: 64*8. Well, 60*8=480 and 4*8=32, so 480+32=512. So ab=512.\n\nWait, let me check if that works in the original equations. Let me verify.\n\nFirst equation: log₈a + log₄(b²) = ?\n\nlog₈64: since 8^2 = 64, so log base 8 of 64 is 2.\n\nlog₄(b²) where b=8: b²=64. log base 4 of 64. 4^3=64, so log₄64=3. Therefore, 2 + 3 = 5. Correct.\n\nSecond equation: log₈b + log₄(a²) = ?\n\nlog₈8: that's 1, since 8^1=8.\n\nlog₄(a²) where a=64: a²=4096. log base 4 of 4096. Let's see, 4^6=4096 because 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024, 4^6=4096. So log₄4096=6. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. Correct. So yes, the answer seems to check out.\n\nBut let me just recap my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, converted logs to base 2. That seems correct because 8 is 2^3 and 4 is 2^2. Then used change of base formula. For example, log₈a is log₂a / log₂8 = log₂a / 3. Similarly for log₄(b²) is (log₂b²)/2 = 2 log₂b / 2 = log₂b. That seems correct.\n\nThen set x and y as log₂a and log₂b, leading to the equations (1/3)x + y = 5 and x + (1/3)y = 7. Then multiplied by 3 to get x + 3y = 15 and 3x + y = 21. Then solved by elimination, got y = 3 and x = 6. Then converted back to a and b, getting 64 and 8. Then checked in original equations. All steps seem okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem? Let me think. For example, maybe using properties of logarithms before changing the base? Let's see.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nlog₈a + log₄b² = 5.\n\nlog₈b + log₄a² = 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express log₄b² as 2 log₄b, so first equation becomes log₈a + 2 log₄b = 5. Similarly, second equation becomes log₈b + 2 log₄a = 7. Then perhaps convert log₈a and log₄b to same base?\n\nBut that's essentially what I did before. So same approach.\n\nAlternatively, since log₈a can be written in terms of log₄a? Let me see. Since 8 is 4^(3/2). Wait, 8 is 2^3 and 4 is 2^2. Alternatively, log base 8 of a is equal to (log base 4 of a) divided by log base 4 of 8. Since change of base formula: log_c(a) = log_d(a)/log_d(c). So log_8(a) = log_4(a)/log_4(8). Since log_4(8) is log_4(2^3) = 3 log_4(2) = 3*(1/2) = 3/2. Because log_4(2) is 1/2 since 4^(1/2)=2. Therefore, log_8(a) = log_4(a) / (3/2) = (2/3) log_4(a). Therefore, log_8(a) = (2/3) log_4(a). Similarly, maybe that's another way to approach.\n\nLet me try this approach for the first equation:\n\nOriginal first equation: log₈a + log₄b² = 5.\n\nExpress log₈a as (2/3) log_4 a. Then equation becomes:\n\n(2/3) log_4 a + log_4 b² = 5.\n\nWhich is (2/3) log_4 a + 2 log_4 b = 5.\n\nSimilarly, if I let u = log_4 a and v = log_4 b, then equation becomes:\n\n(2/3)u + 2v = 5.\n\nSimilarly for the second equation: log_8 b + log_4 a² = 7.\n\nAgain, log_8 b = (2/3) log_4 b, and log_4 a² = 2 log_4 a. Therefore:\n\n(2/3)v + 2u = 7.\n\nSo now the system is:\n\n(2/3)u + 2v = 5,\n\nand\n\n2u + (2/3)v = 7.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nEquation 1: (2/3)u + 2v = 5.\n\nEquation 2: 2u + (2/3)v = 7.\n\nHmm, perhaps solving for u and v. Let me multiply both equations by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\nEquation 1: 2u + 6v = 15.\n\nEquation 2: 6u + 2v = 21.\n\nSo now:\n\nEquation 1a: 2u + 6v = 15.\n\nEquation 2a: 6u + 2v = 21.\n\nLet me solve this system. Let me use elimination again. Let me multiply equation 1a by 3:\n\n6u + 18v = 45. Let's call this equation 1b.\n\nThen subtract equation 2a from equation 1b:\n\n(6u + 18v) - (6u + 2v) = 45 - 21 => 16v = 24 => v = 24/16 = 3/2.\n\nThen substitute back into equation 1a: 2u + 6*(3/2) = 15 => 2u + 9 = 15 => 2u = 6 => u = 3.\n\nSo u = 3 and v = 3/2. Remember u = log_4 a and v = log_4 b. Therefore:\n\nlog_4 a = 3 => a = 4^3 = 64.\n\nlog_4 b = 3/2 => b = 4^(3/2) = (sqrt(4))^3 = 2^3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, ab = 64 * 8 = 512. Same result as before. So this method also gives ab = 512. So this confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter substitution or recognizing symmetry?\n\nLooking back at the original equations, they seem symmetric in a way. If we swap a and b, the first equation becomes the second equation but with different constants (5 vs 7). So maybe if we denote some variables or add the equations?\n\nBut since we already solved it two different ways and got the same answer, maybe that's sufficient. However, just for thoroughness, let me try adding the two original equations after converting them to base 2.\n\nOriginal converted equations:\n\n(log₂a)/3 + log₂b = 5,\n\nand\n\n(log₂b)/3 + log₂a = 7.\n\nLet me denote x = log₂a and y = log₂b again. Then equations are:\n\n(1/3)x + y = 5,\n\nx + (1/3)y = 7.\n\nIf I add these two equations:\n\n(1/3)x + y + x + (1/3)y = 5 + 7 => ( (1/3)x + x ) + ( y + (1/3)y ) = 12 => (4/3)x + (4/3)y = 12 => Multiply both sides by 3/4: x + y = 9.\n\nSo x + y = 9. So log₂a + log₂b = 9 => log₂(ab) = 9 => ab = 2^9 = 512. Wait, that's even simpler! So by adding the two equations, we can directly find ab?\n\nWait, that's brilliant! Let me check that again.\n\nOriginal equations after substitution:\n\n(1/3)x + y = 5,\n\nx + (1/3)y = 7.\n\nAdding them:\n\n(1/3)x + x + y + (1/3)y = 12 => ( (1 + 1/3)x + (1 + 1/3)y ) = 12 => (4/3)x + (4/3)y = 12 => Multiply both sides by 3/4: x + y = 9. Therefore, x + y = 9. Since x = log₂a and y = log₂b, then x + y = log₂a + log₂b = log₂(ab). Therefore, log₂(ab) = 9 => ab = 2^9 = 512. So that's a much quicker way! So instead of solving for x and y individually, adding them gives ab directly. That's clever. So maybe this is the most efficient method.\n\nBut why does this work? Because the coefficients are symmetric in a way when you add them. Let me see. The coefficients of x in the first equation is 1/3 and in the second equation is 1. Similarly, coefficients of y are 1 and 1/3. When adding, they become 4/3 each. Therefore, leading to x + y = 9. Therefore, if you notice this symmetry, you can just add them and get the result immediately.\n\nBut even if you don't notice, solving the system is straightforward. Either way, the answer is 512.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check if ab=512 is indeed 2^9. 2^10 is 1024, so 2^9 is 512. Correct. And our previous calculations showed that a=64 and b=8, so 64*8=512. Correct.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 512. So I think that's solid.\n\nBut just to make sure there are no alternative solutions or if there's a possibility of multiple solutions? Let me think. Since logarithms are involved, we have to make sure that a and b are positive real numbers. Since log₈a and log₈b are defined, a and b must be positive. In our solution, a=64 and b=8 are positive, so that's fine. Also, since we solved the equations algebraically and found a unique solution for x and y, which correspond to unique a and b, there are no other solutions. Therefore, ab must be 512.\n\nSo I think that's thorough. I considered different methods, checked the answer by substitution, confirmed that the system leads uniquely to ab=512. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 512.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ ab $ is \\boxed{512}.\n</think>"}
