So, we have an artificial Earth satellite moving in uniform circular motion. Then it changes its orbit, still in uniform circular motion, but its kinetic energy is reduced to 1/4 of the original. We need to find out the ratios of centripetal acceleration, angular velocity, period, and orbital radius, and choose the correct option from A to D.\n\nFirst, let me recall some physics concepts related to satellites in circular orbits. For a satellite in circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force. The kinetic energy of the satellite is related to its orbital speed and radius. Also, there are relationships between orbital radius, velocity, angular velocity, period, and centripetal acceleration.\n\nLet me start by writing down the expressions for kinetic energy in a circular orbit. The kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv², where m is the mass of the satellite and v is its orbital speed. But since the gravitational force provides the centripetal force, we can relate the orbital speed to the radius of the orbit.\n\nThe gravitational force is given by Newton's law of gravitation: F = G*(M*m)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the satellite, and r is the orbital radius. This force provides the centripetal force required for circular motion, so:\n\nF = m*v² / r\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nG*M*m / r² = m*v² / r\n\nSimplify this equation by canceling m and multiplying both sides by r:\n\nG*M / r = v²\n\nTherefore, v = sqrt(G*M / r)\n\nSo the orbital speed depends on the radius. Now, let's express kinetic energy in terms of r. Since KE = (1/2)mv², substituting v² from above:\n\nKE = (1/2)*m*(G*M / r) = (G*M*m) / (2r)\n\nTherefore, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the orbital radius. If the kinetic energy is reduced to 1/4 of the original, then the new kinetic energy KE' = (1/4) KE. Let me denote the original radius as r₁ and the new radius as r₂. Then:\n\nKE₁ / KE₂ = r₂ / r₁ = 4 / 1, since KE is inversely proportional to r. Wait, KE₁ is original, KE₂ is new. So KE₂ = (1/4) KE₁. Therefore:\n\nKE₁ / KE₂ = 4. So r₂ / r₁ = KE₁ / KE₂ = 4. Therefore, r₂ = 4 r₁? Wait, no. Wait KE is inversely proportional to r. So if KE₂ = (1/4) KE₁, then r₂ = 4 r₁. Yes, because if KE ∝ 1/r, then doubling r halves KE. So if KE is reduced to 1/4, then r must be increased by factor of 4. So orbital radius ratio is original (r₁) to new (r₂) is 1:4. But looking at the options, option D says \"Orbital radius ratio is 1:2\". Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake here? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal KE₁ = (G M m)/(2 r₁)\n\nNew KE₂ = (G M m)/(2 r₂) = (1/4) KE₁\n\nTherefore:\n\n(G M m)/(2 r₂) = (1/4)*(G M m)/(2 r₁)\n\nCancel out (G M m)/(2) from both sides:\n\n1 / r₂ = (1/4) / r₁ => r₁ / r₂ = 1/4 => r₂ = 4 r₁. So original radius r₁ to new radius r₂ is 1:4. Therefore, option D is 1:2, which is not matching. So maybe option D is incorrect. Wait, but maybe I messed up the ratio? The question says \"orbital radius ratio is 1:2\". If the original is r₁ and new is r₂, then the ratio of original to new is r₁/r₂ = 1/4. So none of the options have 1:4. But option D is 1:2. So maybe I made a mistake here? Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the relationship between KE and radius. Let me think again. KE = 1/2 mv². And v² = GM/r. Therefore, KE = 1/2 m (GM/r). So KE is inversely proportional to r. Therefore, if KE is reduced to 1/4, then r must be multiplied by 4. Therefore, the new radius is 4 times the original. So original to new is 1:4. But none of the options have this. The options given are:\n\n(A) Centripetal acceleration ratio 4:1\n\n(B) Angular velocity ratio 2:1\n\n(C) Period ratio 1:8\n\n(D) Orbital radius ratio 1:2\n\nSo D says orbital radius ratio is 1:2, but according to my calculation, it should be 1:4. So perhaps there is a mistake in my reasoning?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe the problem is about the kinetic energy being 1/4, but maybe I need to consider potential energy? Wait no, the question specifically says kinetic energy is reduced to 1/4. So maybe my calculation is correct. Then perhaps option D is wrong? But the options are given. Maybe I made a mistake in another part?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the total mechanical energy? But the question says kinetic energy. Wait, the problem says \"without considering changes in the satellite's mass\", so mass is constant. Therefore, KE is 1/4. Therefore, radius is 4 times. Therefore, if the question is asking for the orbital radius ratio (original to new), it is 1:4. Since none of the options have that, maybe I need to check other options?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in my calculation. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal KE: KE₁ = (1/2) m v₁²\n\nNew KE: KE₂ = (1/4) KE₁ = (1/2) m v₂²\n\nTherefore, v₂² = (1/4) v₁² => v₂ = (1/2) v₁.\n\nBut from earlier, v = sqrt(GM / r). Therefore:\n\nv₁ = sqrt(GM / r₁)\n\nv₂ = sqrt(GM / r₂) = (1/2) sqrt(GM / r₁)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nGM / r₂ = (1/4) (GM / r₁)\n\nTherefore, 1 / r₂ = 1/(4 r₁) => r₂ = 4 r₁. So original radius to new radius is 1:4. So D is 1:2, which is not correct. Therefore, maybe none of the options are correct? But the problem says to choose from A to D. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in another part?\n\nWait, let's check the other options. Maybe the question is not about original to new, but new to original? For example, if the options are phrased as \"the ratio of the satellite's centripetal acceleration before and after is 4:1\", then maybe?\n\nLet me check each option:\n\n(A) Centripetal acceleration ratio is 4:1. So original to new?\n\nCentripetal acceleration a = v² / r. From earlier, we have v² = GM / r. Therefore, a = (GM / r) / r = GM / r². Therefore, centripetal acceleration is proportional to 1 / r².\n\nOriginal a₁ = GM / r₁²\n\nNew a₂ = GM / r₂² = GM / (4 r₁)² = GM / (16 r₁²) = (1/16) a₁ * 16? Wait:\n\nWait, original a₁ = GM / r₁². New a₂ = GM / (4 r₁)² = GM / (16 r₁²) = (1/16) a₁. Therefore, the ratio of original to new is a₁ / a₂ = 16 / 1. Therefore, if option A says 4:1, that is incorrect. So option A is wrong.\n\nOption B: Angular velocity ratio is 2:1. Angular velocity ω = v / r. Original ω₁ = v₁ / r₁. From earlier, v₁ = sqrt(GM / r₁). Therefore, ω₁ = sqrt(GM / r₁) / r₁ = sqrt(GM) / r₁^(3/2). Similarly, ω₂ = sqrt(GM / r₂) / r₂ = sqrt(GM) / r₂^(3/2). Since r₂ = 4 r₁, then ω₂ = sqrt(GM) / (4 r₁)^(3/2) = sqrt(GM) / (4^(3/2) r₁^(3/2)) = sqrt(GM) / (8 r₁^(3/2)) = (1/8) ω₁ * 8? Wait:\n\nOriginal ω₁ = sqrt(GM)/r₁^(3/2)\n\nNew ω₂ = sqrt(GM)/( (4 r₁)^(3/2) ) = sqrt(GM) / (4^(3/2) r₁^(3/2)) ) = sqrt(GM) / (8 r₁^(3/2)) ) = (1/8) ω₁.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of original to new is ω₁ / ω₂ = 8. So if option B says angular velocity ratio is 2:1, that's not correct. Because original to new is 8:1. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: Period ratio is 1:8. The period T is the time to complete one orbit. T = 2πr / v. Let's compute original period T₁ and new period T₂.\n\nFrom earlier, v = sqrt(GM / r). Therefore, T = 2πr / sqrt(GM / r) ) = 2π r^(3/2) / sqrt(GM). Therefore, T is proportional to r^(3/2). So T₁ / T₂ = (r₁ / r₂)^(3/2) = (1/4)^(3/2) = (1/√4^3) = 1/(8). Therefore, T₁ / T₂ = 1/8 => T₁ : T₂ = 1 : 8. Therefore, option C says \"Period ratio is 1:8\". If the question is asking for original period to new period, then yes, 1:8. Therefore, option C is correct? But the problem says \"after the orbital change the satellite's ( )\". Wait, the options are about the ratio after the change. Wait, the question is phrased as \"the satellite's ( )\", and the options are ratios. So need to check which ratio they are referring to.\n\nFor example, option C says \"Period ratio is 1:8\". Assuming that the ratio is original to new, then yes, 1:8. Therefore, option C is correct? But let me check again.\n\nOriginal period T₁ = 2π r₁^(3/2)/sqrt(GM)\n\nNew period T₂ = 2π r₂^(3/2)/sqrt(GM) = 2π (4 r₁)^(3/2)/sqrt(GM) = 2π * 8 r₁^(3/2)/sqrt(GM) = 8 T₁. Therefore, T₁ / T₂ = 1/8, so the ratio of original to new is 1:8. Therefore, option C is correct. So option C is correct?\n\nBut according to my previous calculation for orbital radius, D is 1:2 but should be 1:4. So if D is not correct, but C is correct. However, let me check again.\n\nBut let me check all options again.\n\nOption D: Orbital radius ratio is 1:2. But according to our calculation, it's 1:4. So D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C? But let me check the other options again.\n\nWait, let me check option A again. Centripetal acceleration ratio is 4:1. Original to new a₁/a₂ = 16:1, so if the question is asking for a₁/a₂, then 16:1 is not an option. If the question is asking for a₂/a₁, then it would be 1:16, which is not an option. Therefore, A is wrong.\n\nOption B: Angular velocity ratio is 2:1. Original to new ω₁/ω₂ = 8:1. So if the question is asking for original to new, then 8:1. If the option was 8:1, then it would be correct, but it says 2:1. So B is wrong.\n\nTherefore, only option C is correct? But let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the satellite's ( )\". The options are about ratios. So for example, option C says \"Period ratio is 1:8\". If the original period is T₁ and the new period is T₂, then T₁:T₂ = 1:8. So after the orbital change, the satellite's period is 8 times longer? So the ratio is original to new is 1:8. So option C is correct.\n\nBut let me check again the kinetic energy part. Suppose the original kinetic energy is KE₁, new is KE₂ = KE₁ / 4. From KE = (1/2) m v², so v₂² = (1/4) v₁², so v₂ = v₁ / 2. Also, since v = sqrt(GM / r), so v ∝ 1 / sqrt(r). Therefore, if v₂ = v₁ / 2, then 1 / sqrt(r₂) = 1/(2 sqrt(r₁)), so sqrt(r₂) = 2 sqrt(r₁), so r₂ = 4 r₁. So orbital radius ratio original to new is 1:4, which is not an option. Therefore, D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is C. But let me check the problem again. Wait, the options are (A)-(D). Let me check again if I made a mistake in the period calculation.\n\nThe period T ∝ r^(3/2). If original radius is r₁, new is 4 r₁, then T₂ / T₁ = (4)^(3/2) = 8. Therefore, T₂ = 8 T₁, so original period to new period is 1:8. So option C says \"Period ratio is 1:8\". Therefore, if the question is asking for original to new, then option C is correct. Therefore, the answer is C?\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"after the orbital change the satellite's ( )\". The wording is a bit ambiguous. But usually, when they say \"ratio\", they specify which one comes first. For example, if the question is asking for the ratio of the original to the new period, then it is 1:8. If it's asking for new to original, it would be 8:1. Since option C says \"Period ratio is 1:8\", assuming it's original to new, then it's correct.\n\nBut let me check the other options again. Is there any other possible correct answer?\n\nWait, let's think again. Maybe there is a mistake in assuming that KE is inversely proportional to r? Let me check.\n\nKE = 1/(2) m v². And v² = GM / r. Therefore KE = 1/2 * m * GM / r. So yes, KE is inversely proportional to r. Therefore, if KE is reduced to 1/4, then r increases by factor of 4. Therefore, r₂ = 4 r₁. So orbital radius ratio original to new is 1:4. Therefore, D is 1:2 which is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is referring to something else? Maybe the problem is in another way? For example, maybe the kinetic energy is related to the potential energy? Wait, but the question specifically says kinetic energy is reduced to 1/4. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula? For example, maybe the kinetic energy is considered with the total mechanical energy? But total mechanical energy is -GMm/(2r), so it's negative and also inversely proportional to r. But the question says kinetic energy, which is positive and 1/2 that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check the centripetal acceleration again. Centripetal acceleration is v² / r. Since v² = GM / r, then centripetal acceleration is GM / r². So a ∝ 1 / r². Original a₁ = GM / r₁², new a₂ = GM / (4 r₁)² = GM / (16 r₁²) = a₁ / 16. Therefore, the ratio of original to new is 16:1. So if option A says 4:1, that's not correct.\n\nAngular velocity ω = v / r. Original ω₁ = v₁ / r₁. Since v₁ = sqrt(GM / r₁), ω₁ = sqrt(GM / r₁³). Similarly, ω₂ = sqrt(GM / r₂³) = sqrt(GM / (4 r₁)³) = sqrt(GM) / (8 r₁^(3/2)) = ω₁ / 8. Therefore, original to new is 8:1. So if option B says 2:1, it's wrong.\n\nSo only option C is correct. But let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) Centripetal acceleration ratio is 4:1\n\n(B) Angular velocity ratio is 2:1\n\n(C) Period ratio is 1:8\n\n(D) Orbital radius ratio is 1:2\n\nSo according to my calculations, only option C is correct. Therefore, the answer should be option C. However, let me check again if there is any chance that I messed up the ratio direction.\n\nFor example, maybe the question is asking for the new to original ratio for centripetal acceleration? If so, original to new is 16:1, so new to original is 1:16. Still not matching option A's 4:1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to something else. For example, if the kinetic energy is 1/4, maybe the potential energy is different? But no, the question is only about kinetic energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement? Let me read again:\n\n\"An artificial Earth satellite moves in uniform circular motion around the Earth. If the satellite changes its orbit and still moves in uniform circular motion, with its kinetic energy reduced to 1/4 of the original, without considering changes in the satellite's mass, then after the orbital change the satellite's ( )\"\n\nSo after the orbital change, which of the options is correct? So for example, if the question is about the new satellite's centripetal acceleration compared to before, then original is higher. But the options are ratios. The problem is probably asking for the ratio between before and after. For example, option A says centripetal acceleration ratio is 4:1. If it's original to new, then it should be 16:1. If it's new to original, then 1:16. So no. Option C says period ratio is 1:8. If original to new is 1:8, then it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. However, let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the kinetic energy part. Let me think again. Suppose the kinetic energy is 1/4. Then KE = 1/2 mv², so v is halved. From v = sqrt(GM / r), so if v is halved, then:\n\nOriginal v₁ = sqrt(GM / r₁)\n\nNew v₂ = v₁ / 2 = sqrt(GM / r₂)\n\nTherefore:\n\nsqrt(GM / r₂) = (1/2) sqrt(GM / r₁)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nGM / r₂ = (1/4)(GM / r₁)\n\nCancel GM:\n\n1 / r₂ = 1/(4 r₁) => r₂ = 4 r₁. So yes, radius is 4 times. Therefore, orbital radius ratio original to new is 1:4. So D is 1:2 which is wrong.\n\nTherefore, only option C is correct. Therefore, the answer is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there is any other possible way. For example, maybe the question is in Chinese and the translation is slightly different? But assuming the translation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers the kinetic energy in terms of something else? For example, if the satellite is moving to a lower orbit? But if kinetic energy is reduced, then since KE is inversely proportional to radius, reducing KE would mean increasing radius. So moving to a higher orbit. So radius increases, which makes period increase, centripetal acceleration decrease, angular velocity decrease. Which matches our previous results.\n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
