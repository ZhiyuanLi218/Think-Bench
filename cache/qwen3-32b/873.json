The problem says Mercury orbits the Sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year, and 1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance. The options are given, so maybe I can use some physics formula here.\n\nHmm, I remember Kepler's laws from school. Kepler's third law relates the orbital period of a planet to its average distance from the Sun. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. The formula is something like P² = a³ when P is in Earth years and a is in AU. Wait, let me make sure. Yeah, I think that's right for objects orbiting the Sun. So if P is in years and a is in AU, then P² = a³.\n\nSo Mercury's orbital period is 1/5 of an Earth year. Let me write that down. P = 1/5 year. Then according to Kepler's third law, (1/5)² = a³. Let me calculate that. (1/5) squared is 1/25. So 1/25 = a³. To solve for a, I need to take the cube root of 1/25. \n\nCube root of 1/25... Hmm. Let me think. The cube root of 1 is 1, and cube root of 8 is 2, cube root of 27 is 3. Since 25 is between 8 and 27, but closer to 27. The cube root of 25 is somewhere between 2 and 3, but since it's 1/25, it's between 1/3 and 1/2. Wait, actually, cube root of 1/25 is 1 divided by cube root of 25. Let me approximate that. \n\nCube root of 25 is approximately 2.924, because 2.924³ ≈ 25. So 1 divided by 2.924 is approximately 0.342. So that's roughly 0.34 AU. Now, looking at the options given: A is 1/25 which is 0.04, B is 1/9 ≈ 0.111, C is 1/5 = 0.2, D is 1/3 ≈ 0.333. \n\nMy calculation gives approximately 0.34 AU, which is very close to 1/3 AU (since 1/3 is about 0.333). So the answer should be D: (1/3) AU. Let me double-check. If I cube 1/3, I get (1/3)³ = 1/27 ≈ 0.037. And (1/5)² is 1/25 = 0.04. So 1/27 is close to 1/25? Well, they are both around 0.04. But since Kepler's law is exact in the form P² = a³ only when using the correct constants for the solar system, maybe there's a slight difference due to the actual value of Mercury's orbit. Wait, but in reality, Mercury's orbital period is about 0.24 years, which is roughly 1/4.16 of a year, not exactly 1/5. But the problem says it's approximately 1/5. So using 1/5 as P, then solving for a gives cube root of 1/25 ≈ 0.34, which is closest to 1/3. So D is the correct answer. The actual distance of Mercury is about 0.39 AU, so 0.33 is a bit less, but given the options, 1/3 is the best approximation. So I think the answer is D.\n</think>"}
