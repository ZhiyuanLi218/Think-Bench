The question is about what increases the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor. I think it's something like C equals epsilon times A over d, right? Where C is capacitance, epsilon is the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates, A is the area of the plates, and d is the distance between them. So the formula is C = ε₀ε_r * (A/d), where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity and ε_r is the dielectric constant of the material between the plates.\n\nNow, let's look at each option and see how it affects the capacitance.\n\nOption A: Using smaller plates. If the plates are smaller, the area A decreases. Since capacitance is directly proportional to A, a smaller area would decrease the capacitance. So A would not be the correct answer. It would decrease, not increase.\n\nOption B: Replacing the dielectric with one that has a smaller dielectric constant. The dielectric constant ε_r is in the numerator of the formula. If we use a material with a smaller ε_r, that would decrease the capacitance. So B is also not the right answer. It would lower the capacitance.\n\nOption C: Decreasing the voltage between the plates. Hmm. Wait, the formula for capacitance is C = Q/V, where Q is charge and V is voltage. But the capacitance itself is a property of the physical structure of the capacitor, not the voltage or charge. So changing the voltage doesn't change the capacitance. Capacitance is independent of voltage. So changing the voltage would not affect the capacitance. Therefore, C is not the correct answer. It doesn't increase capacitance.\n\nOption D: Moving the plates closer together. The distance d is in the denominator of the formula. So if we decrease d (move plates closer), the capacitance increases because C is inversely proportional to d. So D would increase the capacitance. That seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check. The formula is C = ε₀ε_r * (A/d). So yes, decreasing d increases C. So D is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't mix up any other factors. Let's go through each again:\n\nA: Smaller plates (A smaller) → C decreases. Correct.\n\nB: Smaller dielectric constant (ε_r smaller) → C decreases. Correct.\n\nC: Voltage decrease. But capacitance doesn't depend on voltage. So changing voltage doesn't affect C. So C is irrelevant. The question is about increasing capacitance, which is a physical property. So C is not correct.\n\nD: Moving plates closer (d smaller) → C increases. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
