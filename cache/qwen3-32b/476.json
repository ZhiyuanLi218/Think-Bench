The position is given by the equation x = 2.0t³ + 4.0t + 6.25. Alright, let me remember how acceleration relates to position. I think acceleration is the second derivative of the position with respect to time. Let me confirm that... Yeah, velocity is the first derivative of position, and acceleration is the derivative of velocity, so the second derivative of position. Got it.\n\nFirst, let me find the velocity function by taking the first derivative of x with respect to t. The position function is 2.0t³ + 4.0t + 6.25. Taking the derivative term by term:\n\nThe derivative of 2.0t³ is 3*2.0t², which is 6.0t².\n\nThe derivative of 4.0t is 4.0, since the derivative of t is 1.\n\nThe derivative of 6.25, a constant, is zero.\n\nSo putting that all together, velocity v(t) = 6.0t² + 4.0 m/s.\n\nNow, acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. Let's take the derivative of v(t):\n\nThe derivative of 6.0t² is 2*6.0t, which is 12.0t.\n\nThe derivative of 4.0 is zero.\n\nTherefore, acceleration a(t) = 12.0t m/s².\n\nNow, plug in t = 1.50 seconds into the acceleration function:\n\na(1.50) = 12.0 * 1.50 = let me calculate that. 12 * 1.5 is the same as 12 * 3/2, which is 18. So 18 m/s².\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 18 m/s². So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the position function: x = 2t³ + 4t + 6.25. First derivative: 6t² + 4. Second derivative: 12t. Yep, that seems right. Then plugging in t = 1.5: 12 * 1.5. 12 * 1 is 12, 12 * 0.5 is 6, so total 18. Correct. So the answer is C. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
