Let me start by recalling what the dark energy equation of state is about. Dark energy is a form of energy that's causing the accelerated expansion of the universe. The equation of state parameter, usually denoted as w, relates the pressure (p) to the energy density (ρ) of dark energy: w = p/ρ. Understanding how w changes over time is crucial for cosmology.\n\nNow, the question is about which method or observation isn't useful for this purpose. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Intensity mapping with CO emission line at frequencies between 10 GHz to 20 GHz. Intensity mapping is a technique used to map the distribution of matter in the universe by observing the emission lines of certain molecules or atoms. CO (carbon monoxide) is a tracer of molecular gas in galaxies. By mapping the distribution of CO emission, we can infer the distribution of galaxies and large-scale structure. This can be used to measure the growth of structure and the expansion history, which are related to dark energy. So this seems relevant. Maybe A is a candidate, but I need to check others.\n\nOption B: Intensity mapping with neutral hydrogen (HI) emission line at frequencies between 600 MHz and 1.4 GHz. HI 21cm line is a common tracer for intensity mapping. Observing HI allows us to map the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the universe, which again can be used to study large-scale structure and thus constrain dark energy parameters. So B is probably relevant. So not the answer.\n\nOption C: Galaxy-redshift surveys at redshift < 2. Galaxy surveys measure the positions and redshifts of galaxies, allowing us to map the 3D distribution of matter. This helps in measuring the growth of structure and the expansion rate, both of which are sensitive to dark energy. Surveys like SDSS or future ones like DESI do this. So C is relevant. So not the answer.\n\nOption D: Measuring the change in frequency of the absorption line (due to expansion of the universe) of cold damped Lyman alpha systems at redshift <2. Damped Lyman alpha systems are high column density neutral hydrogen clouds, often associated with galaxy formation. The absorption lines in quasar spectra can be used to study the distribution of matter. However, the question is about measuring the change in frequency due to expansion. Wait, the expansion causes redshift, but how would measuring the change in frequency of absorption lines help? Maybe it's about the evolution of these systems over time? Or perhaps the velocity structure? Alternatively, maybe the question is about using the absorption lines to track the expansion history. If you can measure the redshift of these systems at different epochs, you can track how the universe is expanding. However, absorption lines in quasar spectra are typically used to study the distribution of matter along the line of sight, but if you're looking at the same system over time, you might track its redshift change. But I'm not sure if that's a standard method. Alternatively, maybe D is not directly measuring the expansion rate but something else. For example, if you're measuring the absorption line's frequency change due to the expansion, but absorption lines are redshifted based on the expansion at the time the light passed through the system. So if you observe many such systems at different redshifts, you can map the expansion history. So maybe D is relevant. However, the key here is whether the method is used to constrain dark energy. If it's about tracking the expansion over time, then yes. But maybe the method described in D is not actually used for that. Alternatively, maybe measuring the change in frequency of the same absorption line over time isn't feasible because the expansion is so slow on human timescales. Wait, the redshift is a one-time effect. Once the light is emitted, the absorption line is at a certain frequency based on the expansion at that time. So measuring the frequency change of the same absorption line over time (i.e., observing the same system at different times) would not work because the redshift is fixed once the light is emitted. So perhaps the question is phrased in a way that D is not a valid method. Alternatively, maybe the \"change in frequency\" refers to the shift due to the expansion as the universe evolves. But if you're looking at different systems at different redshifts, you can see how the absorption features change with redshift. But the wording says \"change in frequency of the absorption line (due to expansion of the universe) of cold damped Lyman alpha systems at redshift <2.\" Maybe this is referring to using the redshift of these systems as a function of their position in the universe to map the expansion. But how is that different from galaxy surveys? If you're using absorption lines in quasars to measure the distribution of matter, similar to how galaxy surveys do, then it's relevant. But if the method described in D is not actually used to constrain dark energy, then maybe D is the answer. Alternatively, maybe D is not useful because damped Lyman alpha systems are more about the distribution of neutral hydrogen and galaxy formation, not the expansion rate. Hmm. Alternatively, the question is about measuring the change in frequency of the absorption line due to the expansion. If you have a single absorption line in a quasar spectrum, its redshift tells you the redshift of the absorber. But measuring the \"change in frequency\" over time for the same absorber isn't feasible because the absorber's redshift is fixed once the light was emitted. So maybe the method described in D is not actually a valid method for constraining dark energy. Therefore, D is not relevant. So the answer would be D. Let me check again. The other options are about mapping structure (CO and HI intensity mapping, galaxy surveys) which are all standard methods for studying dark energy. Option D's method might not be a standard way to constrain dark energy. So D is the answer.\n</think>"}
