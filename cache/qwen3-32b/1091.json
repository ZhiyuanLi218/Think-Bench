I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, so I'll need to think through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: Adding ethyl (probably ethanol) to an acidic potassium permanganate solution and letting it stand. I remember that potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, it usually oxidizes alcohols. Ethanol oxidation would go from ethanol to ethanoic acid (acetic acid) via ethanal (acetaldehyde), right? But during this process, the purple MnO4^- would be reduced to Mn^2+ which is colorless. So the solution would fade from purple. Then, when they stand, maybe the products are immiscible, causing separation. So the phenomenon seems correct. So A might be okay.\n\nOption B: Inserting a lit magnesium strip into CO2. I think magnesium is a strong reducing agent. When it burns in CO2, it might react with CO2 to form magnesium oxide and carbon. The reaction is 2 Mg + CO2 → 2 MgO + C. So the black particles would be carbon, and the dense smoke could be from the burning magnesium or the products. So B's description matches. So B is okay.\n\nOption C: Adding dilute HCl to sodium thiosulfate. Sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) reacting with HCl would produce sulfur, SO2 gas, and water. The reaction is Na2S2O3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + S↓ + SO2↑ + H2O. So the pungent gas is SO2 (sulfur dioxide), and the turbidity is due to sulfur precipitating. So the phenomenon described here is correct. So C is okay.\n\nOption D: Adding excess iron powder to FeCl3 solution. FeCl3 is a solution of Fe^3+ ions. Iron metal (Fe) can reduce Fe^3+ to Fe^2+ according to the reaction: Fe + 2 Fe^3+ → 3 Fe^2+. The solution would change from yellow (Fe^3+ color) to pale green (Fe^2+). After adding excess Fe, the solution would be Fe^2+ dominant, so yellow color disappears. Then adding KSCN (potassium thiocyanate) would test for Fe^3+ because Fe^3+ forms a blood red complex with SCN^- (like Fe(SCN)^2+). But since all Fe^3+ has been reduced to Fe^2+, adding KSCN shouldn't give a red color. However, the phenomenon says \"the yellow color gradually disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN solution is added\". Wait, the phenomenon description is incomplete? The description for D says \"the yellow color gradually disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN solution is added\". But what happens after adding KSCN? The options probably have a typo or incomplete description. Wait, looking back at the table for D: the experimental phenomenon is \"The yellow color gradually disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN solution is added\". Wait, the phenomenon should be what is observed, but the phenomenon here is that they added KSCN. That seems odd. Maybe the phenomenon should be that after adding KSCN, there's no color change, or maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again. The experimental operation for D is adding excess iron to FeCl3 solution and shaking. The phenomenon is \"the yellow color disappears and 1 drop of KSCN is added\". Wait, adding KSCN is part of the operation? No, the operation is adding excess iron to FeCl3 solution and shaking. The phenomenon is the result of that operation. But the phenomenon says \"the yellow color disappears and 1 drop of KSCN is added\". That seems like the phenomenon is not just the color change but also adding KSCN. But that's part of the operation? Or is the phenomenon that after the reaction, when you add KSCN, there's no color change? Maybe the description is missing the actual observed result after adding KSCN. For example, if after the reaction, the solution is Fe^2+ dominant, adding KSCN would not turn red. But the phenomenon says \"the yellow color gradually disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN solution is added\". Wait, maybe the phenomenon is incomplete. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal table for D: Experimental Operation is \"Adding an excess of iron powder to a test tube containing FeCl3 solution and shaking it well\". Experimental Phenomenon is \"The yellow color gradually disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN solution is added\". Wait, that can't be right. The phenomenon should be the result observed, not an action taken. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's translation or formatting. Maybe the phenomenon is supposed to say that after the reaction, when you add KSCN, there's no color change. But as written, the phenomenon is that you add KSCN. That would be part of the operation, not the phenomenon. So maybe there's an error in the problem's phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the phenomenon is that the solution turns red when KSCN is added, which would be incorrect because Fe^3+ should be reduced. So if the phenomenon says that after adding KSCN, there's a red color, that would be wrong. But according to the given table for D, the phenomenon is \"The yellow color gradually disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN solution is added\". Wait, the phenomenon is that after adding the iron, the yellow color disappears and then they add KSCN. But the phenomenon should be what is observed. So perhaps the actual phenomenon is that after the reaction, when you add KSCN, there's no red color. If the problem says that the phenomenon is that after adding KSCN, there's a red color, that would be incorrect. But the way it's written is confusing. Let me re-express the problem's D entry.\n\nD's operation: Add excess iron to FeCl3 solution and shake.\n\nPhenomenon: The yellow color disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN is added.\n\nBut the phenomenon should be what is observed. So maybe the phenomenon is that after adding KSCN, there's no color change. If the problem says the phenomenon is that the yellow color disappears and KSCN is added, that's not a phenomenon but an action. Therefore, there's likely a mistake in the problem's description for option D. Alternatively, maybe the phenomenon is that after the reaction, when you add KSCN, there's no color change. If the problem states that the phenomenon is that the yellow color disappears and KSCN is added, but the actual expected phenomenon would be that no red color forms, then the given phenomenon is incorrect. But the way it's written is unclear. \n\nAssuming that the phenomenon for D is that after the reaction, when you add KSCN, there's no color change (since all Fe^3+ is reduced to Fe^2+), but the given phenomenon says \"the yellow color gradually disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN solution is added\", which is just stating an action, not the result. Therefore, this is inconsistent. The phenomenon should describe what happens when you do the operation. For example, the correct phenomenon would be \"the yellow color fades and adding KSCN shows no color change (or no red color)\". If the problem's phenomenon for D is incomplete or incorrectly states that after adding KSCN there is a color change, then that would be the incorrect one. But given the way it's written, I think the problem might have a typo. However, based on the options given, the answer is likely D because the phenomenon is not properly described. Alternatively, maybe the phenomenon for D is that after adding KSCN, there is a red color, which would be wrong, but the problem's description is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phenomenon is supposed to be that after the reaction, the solution is colorless and when you add KSCN, it turns red. But that would be incorrect because Fe^3+ should be reduced. So if the phenomenon states that after adding KSCN, it turns red, that's wrong. Therefore, if the problem's D phenomenon is that after adding KSCN, there's a red color, then D is incorrect. But the way it's written in the problem is that the phenomenon is \"the yellow color gradually disappears, and 1 drop of KSCN solution is added\". So the phenomenon is not the result of adding KSCN but the action of adding it. Therefore, this is a mistake in the problem's phrasing, but given the options, we have to assume that the phenomenon for D is that after the reaction, adding KSCN causes a color change, which would be incorrect. Therefore, D is the one that doesn't match. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
