Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me substitute a with 8. So the expression becomes (16 * cube root of (8^2))^(1/3). Let me make sure I got that right. The original expression is (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3). Yeah, so replacing a with 8 gives me (16 * ∛(8²))^(1/3). \n\nNow, let me compute 8 squared first. 8 squared is 64, right? Because 8*8 is 64. So then the expression becomes (16 * ∛64)^(1/3). Wait, no, hold on. It's ∛(8²) which is ∛64. But ∛64 is the cube root of 64. Hmm, what's the cube root of 64? Let me recall. The cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. So, 4 cubed is 64 because 4*4=16, 16*4=64. So ∛64 is 4. So that simplifies the inside part. \n\nSo replacing that, the expression is now (16 * 4)^(1/3). Let me calculate 16*4. 16*4 is 64. So now it's 64 raised to the power of 1/3. Which is the cube root of 64 again? Wait, but we already did the cube root of 64 earlier, which was 4. So does that mean the answer is 4? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal expression: (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3) with a=8.\n\nFirst step: substitute a=8: (16 * ∛(8²))^(1/3).\n\nCompute 8²: 64. So (16 * ∛64)^(1/3).\n\nCompute ∛64: 4. So (16 * 4)^(1/3) = 64^(1/3).\n\nCompute 64^(1/3): 4. So the answer is 4? That seems straightforward, but let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using exponent rules, to confirm.\n\nLet me rewrite the original expression using exponents instead of radicals. Remember that the cube root of something is the same as raising it to the power of 1/3. So ∛(a²) is a^(2/3). Therefore, the original expression is [16 * a^(2/3)]^(1/3). Then, applying the exponent 1/3 to both factors inside the brackets. Wait, actually, when you have a product raised to a power, you can apply the power to each factor separately. So that would be 16^(1/3) multiplied by [a^(2/3)]^(1/3). \n\nLet me verify that. The formula is (xy)^n = x^n * y^n. So yes, that works. Therefore, the expression becomes 16^(1/3) * [a^(2/3)]^(1/3). Then, simplifying the exponents. For the second term, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So [a^(2/3)]^(1/3) is a^(2/3 * 1/3) = a^(2/9). \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 16^(1/3) * a^(2/9). Now, since a is given as 8, substitute that in: 16^(1/3) * 8^(2/9). Hmm, this seems different from my previous approach. Wait, but maybe they are equivalent? Let me check.\n\nIn my first approach, I substituted a=8 early on and simplified step by step. In this second approach, I'm using exponent rules and substituting later. Let me see if both give the same result.\n\nFirst, let me compute 16^(1/3) * 8^(2/9). Let me express 16 and 8 as powers of 2. 16 is 2^4, and 8 is 2^3. Therefore, substituting:\n\n16^(1/3) = (2^4)^(1/3) = 2^(4/3).\n\n8^(2/9) = (2^3)^(2/9) = 2^(3*(2/9)) = 2^(6/9) = 2^(2/3).\n\nTherefore, multiplying these together: 2^(4/3) * 2^(2/3) = 2^(4/3 + 2/3) = 2^(6/3) = 2^2 = 4. \n\nSo this approach also gives me 4. So both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is indeed 4. \n\nBut let me just check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent rules? Let me go through that again.\n\nOriginal expression: [16 * ∛(a²)]^(1/3). Let me convert all to exponents:\n\n16 is 2^4, ∛(a²) is a^(2/3). So inside the brackets: 2^4 * a^(2/3). Then raising to the 1/3 power: [2^4 * a^(2/3)]^(1/3) = 2^(4*(1/3)) * a^((2/3)*(1/3)) = 2^(4/3) * a^(2/9). Then substituting a=8, which is 2^3:\n\nSo 2^(4/3) * (2^3)^(2/9) = 2^(4/3) * 2^(6/9) = 2^(4/3 + 2/3) = 2^(6/3) = 2^2 = 4. Yep, same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me try to combine the exponents differently. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the original expression: (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3). Let me think of 16 as 2^4, and ∛(a²) as a^(2/3). Then multiplying them together gives 2^4 * a^(2/3). Then raising to the 1/3 power: 2^(4/3) * a^(2/9). Since a is 8, which is 2^3, substitute:\n\n2^(4/3) * (2^3)^(2/9) = 2^(4/3) * 2^(6/9) = 2^(4/3 + 2/3) = 2^(6/3) = 2^2 = 4. Same answer again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire original expression as exponents with base 2. Let me try that.\n\nOriginal expression: (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3) with a=8.\n\nExpress 16 as 2^4, a=8 is 2^3. Then ∛(a²) is ∛[(2^3)^2] = ∛(2^6) = 2^(6/3) = 2^2. Wait, that's interesting. Wait, ∛(a²) when a=8 is ∛(8²) = ∛(64) = 4, which is 2^2. So then 16 * ∛(a²) is 2^4 * 2^2 = 2^(4+2) = 2^6. Then raising that to the 1/3 power: (2^6)^(1/3) = 2^(6*(1/3)) = 2^2 = 4. \n\nOh, that's a more straightforward way! Let me recap:\n\nStart with ∛(a²) when a=8. Since a=8=2^3, then a²=(2^3)^2=2^6. Then the cube root of 2^6 is 2^(6/3)=2^2. Then multiply by 16, which is 2^4: 2^4 * 2^2 = 2^(4+2)=2^6. Then take the cube root (which is exponent 1/3): 2^(6*(1/3))=2^2=4. \n\nThis seems like the most efficient method. All these different approaches are leading me to the same answer, which is reassuring. So regardless of the method I use—whether substituting early and simplifying step by step, or using exponent rules and converting everything to base 2—the answer is 4. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't overlook something, let me check each step again in this last method:\n\n1. a = 8 = 2^3. Correct.\n2. a² = (2^3)^2 = 2^(3*2) = 2^6. Correct.\n3. ∛(a²) = ∛(2^6) = 2^(6/3) = 2^2 = 4. Correct.\n4. 16 is 2^4. Correct.\n5. Multiply 2^4 * 2^2 = 2^(4+2) = 2^6. Correct.\n6. Take the 1/3 power: (2^6)^(1/3) = 2^(6*(1/3)) = 2^2 = 4. Correct.\n\nAll steps check out. \n\nAnother way to think about it: Maybe using decimal approximations? Although that might be overkill here since everything is integers, but just to verify. Let me try.\n\nOriginal expression: (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3) with a=8.\n\nCompute inside first: ∛(8²) = ∛64 ≈ 4.0 (exactly 4, since 4^3=64). Then 16*4=64. Then 64^(1/3) is 4. So decimal-wise, it's exact. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't know that ∛64 is 4, maybe I could approximate. For example, if I thought ∛64 was something else... but no, 4^3 is 64, so it's exact. \n\nAlternatively, if I messed up the exponents somewhere, but no, all steps seem consistent. \n\nIs there any chance I misapplied the order of operations? Let me check. The original expression is (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3). So first compute ∛(a²), then multiply by 16, then take the cube root (wait, no, it's raised to 1/3, which is cube root). Wait, so first compute the inside: 16 times cube root of a squared, then take the cube root of that? Wait, no, exponent 1/3 is the cube root. So the entire expression is cube root of [16 * cube root(a²)]. Wait, but cube root of something is already a 1/3 exponent. Wait, so if you have something like [x]^1/3, that's the cube root of x. So the entire expression is cube root of [16 * ∛(a²)]. Which is the same as (((16 * ∛(a²)))^(1/3)). \n\nBut in my calculation, when I substituted a=8, I had cube root of [16 * 4] = cube root of 64 = 4. So that's straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, if someone misreads the expression as 16 multiplied by the cube root of (a²) raised to the 1/3, but no, parentheses are important here. The exponent 1/3 applies to the entire product 16 * ∛(a²). So no ambiguity there. \n\nAnother check: Let me compute the value step by step numerically without substitution. Let me compute ∛(a²) first. If a=8, then ∛(8²) is ∛64=4. Then multiply by 16: 16*4=64. Then take the cube root of 64: 4. Yep, same result. \n\nAlternatively, if I tried to do all the exponents at once. Let me think. The original expression is (16 * a^(2/3))^(1/3). Let me combine the constants and exponents. Let me write 16 as 2^4 and a as 2^3. Then:\n\n(2^4 * (2^3)^(2/3))^(1/3) = (2^4 * 2^(3*(2/3)))^(1/3) = (2^4 * 2^2)^(1/3) = (2^(4+2))^(1/3) = (2^6)^(1/3) = 2^(6*(1/3)) = 2^2 = 4. Same result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 4. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 4. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't overlook any possible mistake, let me think if there's a different interpretation of the original problem. For example, maybe the expression is 16 multiplied by the cube root of (a²) raised to the 1/3? But no, the way it's written is (16 * cube root(a²))^(1/3). If it were 16 * [cube root(a²)]^(1/3), that would be different. Let me check that hypothetical scenario for thoroughness. \n\nIf it were 16 * [∛(a²)]^(1/3), then that would be 16 * [a^(2/3)]^(1/3) = 16 * a^(2/9). Then substituting a=8: 16 * 8^(2/9). Which is different. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 8^(1/9) is the ninth root of 8. Since 8 is 2^3, 8^(1/9) = 2^(3/9) = 2^(1/3). Therefore, 8^(2/9) = [8^(1/9)]^2 = [2^(1/3)]^2 = 2^(2/3). Therefore, 16 * 2^(2/3). 16 is 2^4, so 2^4 * 2^(2/3) = 2^(4 + 2/3) = 2^(14/3) ≈ ... which is definitely not 4. Therefore, if the expression were interpreted differently, we would get a different answer. But since the original problem has parentheses around the 16 and the cube root, indicating that the entire product is raised to the 1/3 power, the correct interpretation is the one that leads us to 4. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\nJust another angle: Let me compute the original expression using decimal exponents. \n\nOriginal expression: (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3). Let me write all numbers with exponents:\n\n16 = 16.0\n\na = 8, so a² = 64. ∛64 = 4.0. Then 16.0 * 4.0 = 64.0. Then 64.0^(1/3) = 4.0. \n\nSo decimal computation also gives 4. \n\nAlternatively, if I use logarithms? Although that's more complicated, but let's try. \n\nLet me compute the expression step by step using logarithm. Let me take natural logarithm, compute, then exponentiate. \n\nLet me denote the expression as E = (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3). Taking natural log:\n\nln(E) = (1/3) * ln(16 * ∛(a²)) = (1/3)[ln(16) + ln(∛(a²))] = (1/3)[ln(16) + (1/3)ln(a²)] = (1/3)[ln(16) + (1/3)(2 ln a)] = (1/3)[ln(16) + (2/3) ln a]. \n\nNow, substituting a=8:\n\nln(E) = (1/3)[ln(16) + (2/3) ln(8)]. \n\nCompute ln(16) and ln(8). \n\nWe know that 16 is 2^4, so ln(16)=4 ln 2. Similarly, 8 is 2^3, so ln(8)=3 ln 2. Therefore:\n\nln(E) = (1/3)[4 ln 2 + (2/3)(3 ln 2)] = (1/3)[4 ln 2 + 2 ln 2] = (1/3)(6 ln 2) = 2 ln 2. \n\nTherefore, exponentiating both sides:\n\nE = e^(2 ln 2) = (e^(ln 2))^2 = 2^2 = 4. \n\nWow, that worked out! Using natural logarithms also leads me to E=4. \n\nThis is another confirmation. Therefore, regardless of the method—be it straightforward substitution, exponent rules, decimal computation, or logarithms—the answer is consistently 4. \n\nTherefore, I can be absolutely sure that the value of the expression is 4 when a=8. \n\nJust to recap all steps in one place:\n\nGiven a = 8, compute (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3).\n\n1. Calculate a²: 8² = 64.\n2. Take the cube root of 64: ∛64 = 4.\n3. Multiply by 16: 16 * 4 = 64.\n4. Take the cube root of the result: ∛64 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, using exponents:\n\n1. Express 16 as 2⁴ and a as 2³.\n2. Compute a²: (2³)² = 2⁶.\n3. Take cube root of a²: ∛(2⁶) = 2⁶⁄³ = 2².\n4. Multiply by 16 (2⁴): 2⁴ * 2² = 2⁶.\n5. Take cube root: (2⁶)¹⁄³ = 2² = 4.\n\nAll methods confirm the answer is 4. \n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't find any mistakes in my reasoning, and multiple approaches confirm the same result. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>"}
