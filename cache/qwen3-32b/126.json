In this case, the amplitudes are 4 cm and 6 cm, respectively.\n\n---\n\n### Key Concept: Superposition and Interference\n\nThe **principle of superposition** states that the resultant displacement at any point is the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves at that point. The **resultant amplitude**, however, is not simply the sum of the two amplitudes unless the waves are in perfect phase alignment.\n\nThe general formula for the **amplitude of the resultant wave** when two waves of amplitudes $ A_1 $ and $ A_2 $ and phase difference $ \\phi $ interfere is:\n\n$$\nA_{\\text{resultant}} = \\sqrt{A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2A_1A_2\\cos\\phi}\n$$\n\nWhere $ \\phi $ is the phase difference between the two waves.\n\n---\n\n### Applying the Formula\n\nGiven:\n- $ A_1 = 4 $ cm  \n- $ A_2 = 6 $ cm  \n\nThe maximum possible amplitude occurs when the waves are in phase (i.e., $ \\cos\\phi = 1 $):\n\n$$\nA_{\\text{max}} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2 + 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1} = \\sqrt{16 + 36 + 48} = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\text{ cm}\n$$\n\nThe minimum possible amplitude occurs when the waves are completely out of phase (i.e., $ \\cos\\phi = -1 $):\n\n$$\nA_{\\text{min}} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2 + 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (-1)} = \\sqrt{16 + 36 - 48} = \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\text{ cm}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Interpretation of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the range of the **displacement $ D $** of the resultant wave. Since the displacement of a wave at any point in time can vary between $ -A $ and $ +A $, where $ A $ is the amplitude, the **maximum possible displacement** of the resultant wave is 10 cm, and the **minimum possible displacement** is 2 cm.\n\nTherefore, the **displacement $ D $** of the resultant wave can range from **2 cm to 10 cm**, depending on the phase relationship between the two waves.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{A}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about two traveling waves with the same frequency but different amplitudes—4 cm and 6 cm—superimposing in a single medium. We need to determine the possible displacement of the resultant wave.\n\nFirst, I remember that when two waves superimpose, their displacements add up. But since they have the same frequency, I think this is about constructive and destructive interference. But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the phase difference between the two waves. Hmm, that might be important.\n\nIf the waves are in phase, meaning their crests and troughs align perfectly, then their amplitudes add up. So, 4 cm + 6 cm would give a maximum amplitude of 10 cm. That would be constructive interference. On the other hand, if they are completely out of phase, like one's crest meets the other's trough, then they would destructively interfere. In that case, the amplitudes subtract. So, 6 cm - 4 cm would be 2 cm. \n\nBut wait, can they completely cancel each other out? Since the amplitudes are different, the maximum destructive interference would just make the resultant amplitude the difference between them, right? So the displacement of the resultant wave would vary between 2 cm and 10 cm, depending on the phase difference. \n\nSo the possible displacement D of the resultant wave would be somewhere between 2 cm and 10 cm. The question asks which option best describes this. Let me check the options again:\n\nA: 2 cm ≤ D ≤ 10 cm  \nB: D = 5 cm  \nC: D = 10 cm  \nD: 10 cm ≤ D ≤ 12 cm  \n\nOption A says the displacement is between 2 and 10 cm. That seems to fit with what I was thinking. Option B suggests a fixed displacement of 5 cm, which doesn't make sense because the displacement depends on the phase difference. It can vary. Option C is only the maximum possible displacement, but the question is about the displacement in general. Option D starts at 10 cm, but we know that if they destructively interfere, it can go down to 2 cm. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Let me just verify once more. The formula for the amplitude of the resultant wave when two waves superimpose is given by the square root of (A1² + A2² + 2A1A2 cos φ), where φ is the phase difference. Since the phase difference can vary between 0 and 2π, cos φ varies between -1 and 1. So the maximum amplitude is when cos φ = 1: sqrt(4² + 6² + 2*4*6*1) = sqrt(16 + 36 + 48) = sqrt(100) = 10 cm. The minimum amplitude is when cos φ = -1: sqrt(16 + 36 - 48) = sqrt(4) = 2 cm. Therefore, the amplitude of the resultant wave varies between 2 cm and 10 cm. Since displacement D refers to the instantaneous displacement, which can be anywhere between -A and +A for a wave, but since they are asking about the magnitude or the possible range of D, maybe it's referring to the amplitude? Wait, actually, displacement D in the question—does it refer to the maximum displacement (amplitude) or the instantaneous displacement?\n\nWait, the question says \"the displacement, D, of the resultant wave\". Hmm. If it's talking about the displacement at any point in time and space, then it can vary between -10 cm and +10 cm when they are in phase, but if they are out of phase, it can vary between -2 cm and +2 cm. However, depending on the phase difference, the resultant wave's displacement at any point would oscillate between -A_resultant and +A_resultant. But the question is a bit ambiguous. However, since they are asking which option best describes D, and given the answer choices, they are probably referring to the possible maximum displacement (amplitude) of the resultant wave. Because if they meant instantaneous displacement, then technically D could be anywhere between -10 cm to +10 cm or -2 cm to +2 cm depending on phase. But the answer options don't have negative values, so maybe they are talking about the magnitude of displacement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the possible amplitudes. Since the amplitude of the resultant wave can range from 2 cm to 10 cm, then the displacement D (as in the amplitude) would be between 2 and 10 cm. Therefore, option A is correct. The other options don't cover the full range or are fixed values. So I think A is the right answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
