Then, I have to compute the sum S from p=1 to 2007 of b(p), and find the remainder when S is divided by 1000. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand what b(p) represents. It says that for each p, there's a unique k where |k - sqrt(p)| < 1/2. So, solving for p, this inequality would translate to sqrt(p) being in the interval (k - 1/2, k + 1/2). If I square all parts of the inequality, since sqrt(p) is positive, squaring should preserve the inequalities. Let me check that.\n\nStarting with:\n\nk - 1/2 < sqrt(p) < k + 1/2\n\nSquaring all sides:\n\n(k - 1/2)^2 < p < (k + 1/2)^2\n\nSo, p must be in the interval ((k - 1/2)^2, (k + 1/2)^2). Since p is an integer, the values of p for which b(p) = k are the integers strictly between those two squares. However, since p must be a positive integer, we need to take the ceiling of the lower bound and the floor of the upper bound. \n\nWait, but since the original inequality is strict, does that mean p is strictly between those squares? Let me check with the examples given. For example, they say b(6) = 2. Let's check:\n\nFor k=2, the interval is (2 - 0.5)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25, and (2 + 0.5)^2 = 2.5^2 = 6.25. So p must be between 2.25 and 6.25. Therefore, integer p's are 3,4,5,6. But the example says b(6)=2, so 6 is included. But since the upper bound is 6.25, p=6 is less than 6.25, so yes, 6 is included. However, the lower bound is 2.25, so p starts at 3. So for k=2, p ranges from 3 up to 6 inclusive. But then why does p=2 not fall into this? Let's check for k=1. For k=1, the interval would be (1 - 0.5)^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25, and (1 + 0.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, p must be between 0.25 and 2.25, so integers p=1, 2. Therefore, b(1)=1, b(2)=1, and starting from p=3, it's k=2. So that makes sense. For p=6, it's still in k=2's range because 6 < 6.25. \n\nTherefore, in general, for each k, the values of p where b(p)=k are the integers from ceil((k - 0.5)^2) up to floor((k + 0.5)^2 - epsilon), where epsilon is a tiny positive number. But since (k + 0.5)^2 is not an integer (since k is integer, 0.5 squared terms... let me check. Let's compute (k + 0.5)^2 = k^2 + k + 0.25. Similarly, (k - 0.5)^2 = k^2 - k + 0.25. Therefore, since p must be integer, the lower bound is ceil(k^2 - k + 0.25). Since k^2 - k is integer, adding 0.25 makes it a number with 0.25 decimal. The ceiling of that is k^2 - k + 1. Similarly, upper bound is floor(k^2 + k + 0.25). Since k^2 + k is integer, adding 0.25 gives a number with 0.25 decimal, so the floor is k^2 + k. Therefore, the number of integers p with b(p) = k is (k^2 + k) - (k^2 - k + 1) + 1 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. Upper bound minus lower bound plus 1 (since inclusive). Upper bound is k^2 + k, lower bound is k^2 - k + 1. Therefore, the number of terms is (k^2 + k) - (k^2 - k + 1) + 1 = k^2 + k - k^2 + k -1 +1 = 2k. \n\nWait, so for each k, there are 2k integers p where b(p) = k. Let me check with the example. For k=1: 2*1=2 numbers. Indeed, p=1,2. For k=2: 2*2=4 numbers, p=3,4,5,6. Which matches the example given (since b(6)=2). So that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, in general, each k corresponds to 2k numbers p, where b(p)=k. However, this might not hold for the last k, because when p=2007, we might not have the full 2k numbers. Therefore, we need to find for which k this holds, and then check up to which k we can apply this formula, and then handle the remaining p's separately. \n\nSo, first, let's figure out the range of k's. For each k, the p's go from (k - 0.5)^2 to (k + 0.5)^2. The maximum p is 2007, so we need to find the maximum k such that (k + 0.5)^2 > 2007. Wait, but actually, the upper limit for each k is (k + 0.5)^2. Therefore, the maximum k for which there exists p with b(p)=k is the k such that (k - 0.5)^2 < 2007 < (k + 0.5)^2. Wait, no. Actually, the maximum k will be such that (k - 0.5)^2 < 2007 < (k + 0.5)^2? Or maybe we need to find the k where (k - 0.5)^2 < 2007 < (k + 0.5)^2. Wait, but since p goes up to 2007, we need to find all k's such that their intervals overlap with p from 1 to 2007. \n\nAlternatively, since each k corresponds to p from m to n, where m = ceil((k - 0.5)^2) and n = floor((k + 0.5)^2). But as we saw earlier, m = k^2 - k + 1 and n = k^2 + k. Therefore, the maximum k for which k^2 + k >= 1, which is always true for k >= 1. But we need to find up to which k, the upper bound n = k^2 + k is less than or equal to 2007, and then handle the last k where it might exceed 2007. \n\nSo let's solve for k in k^2 + k <= 2007. Let's approximate this quadratic equation. Let me solve k^2 + k - 2007 = 0. Using quadratic formula:\n\nk = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*2007)] / 2. Since k is positive, take the positive root:\n\nk = [ -1 + sqrt(1 + 8028) ] / 2 = [ -1 + sqrt(8029) ] / 2. Let me approximate sqrt(8029). Well, 89^2 = 7921, 90^2=8100. So sqrt(8029) is between 89 and 90. Let me compute 89.5^2 = (89 + 0.5)^2 = 89^2 + 2*89*0.5 + 0.25 = 7921 + 89 + 0.25 = 8010.25. Hmm, 8010.25. Our target is 8029. So difference is 8029 - 8010.25 = 18.75. Now, let's see how much more we need to add to 89.5 to get sqrt(8029). Let me denote x = 89.5 + d, such that x^2 = 8029. Then, expanding:\n\n(89.5 + d)^2 = 89.5^2 + 2*89.5*d + d^2 = 8010.25 + 179d + d^2 = 8029. So approximately, 179d ≈ 18.75 => d ≈ 18.75 / 179 ≈ 0.1047. Therefore sqrt(8029) ≈ 89.5 + 0.1047 ≈ 89.6047. Therefore, k ≈ (-1 + 89.6047)/2 ≈ (88.6047)/2 ≈ 44.302. So the integer k where k^2 +k crosses 2007 is around 44.3. Therefore, k=44 will have k^2 +k = 44^2 + 44 = 1936 + 44 = 1980. Then k=45: 45^2 + 45 = 2025 + 45 = 2070. \n\nSo for k=44, upper bound is 1980, and for k=45, upper bound is 2070. Since our upper limit is 2007, which is between 1980 and 2070. Therefore, for k from 1 to 44, each contributes 2k numbers, and then for k=45, the numbers p go from ceil((45 - 0.5)^2) to 2007. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let me confirm the lower bound for k=45: (45 - 0.5)^2 = 44.5^2. Let me compute 44.5^2. 44^2 = 1936, 0.5^2=0.25, and cross term 2*44*0.5=44. Therefore, (44 + 0.5)^2 = 1936 + 44 + 0.25 = 1980.25. Therefore, ceil(1980.25) = 1981. The upper bound for k=45 would normally be (45 + 0.5)^2 = 45.5^2. Let me compute that. 45^2 = 2025, 0.5^2=0.25, cross term 2*45*0.5=45. Therefore, 2025 + 45 + 0.25 = 2070.25. So normally, the upper bound is floor(2070.25) = 2070. However, since our p only goes up to 2007, we need to adjust that upper bound. Therefore, for k=45, the number of p's is from 1981 to 2007 inclusive. Let me compute how many numbers that is. 2007 - 1981 + 1 = 27. \n\nTherefore, the total sum S can be calculated as the sum over k=1 to 44 of [2k * k] plus the sum for k=45 of [27 * 45]. Wait, because for each k from 1 to 44, there are 2k values of p, each contributing k to the sum. Therefore, the total contribution is 2k * k = 2k². Then for k=45, there are 27 terms, each contributing 45, so 27*45. Then add all those up. \n\nSo first, let me compute the sum from k=1 to 44 of 2k². Then add 27*45. Then take the total modulo 1000. \n\nFirst, let me recall that the formula for the sum of squares from 1 to n is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Therefore, the sum from k=1 to n of 2k² is 2 * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/3]. \n\nSo for n=44, compute [44 * 45 * 89]/3. Let me compute that. First, note that 44 divided by 3 is not an integer, but maybe we can simplify. Let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, 44 * 45 = 1980. Then multiply by 89: 1980 * 89. Let me compute 1980 * 90 = 178,200, subtract 1980 to get 178,200 - 1,980 = 176,220. Then divide by 3: 176,220 / 3 = 58,740. \n\nSo the sum from k=1 to 44 of 2k² is 58,740. \n\nThen add the contribution from k=45, which is 27*45. Let me compute that: 27*45. Well, 27*40=1,080 and 27*5=135, so total is 1,080 + 135 = 1,215. \n\nTherefore, total S = 58,740 + 1,215 = 59,955. \n\nBut wait, before I proceed, I need to check whether my calculation for the number of terms for k=45 is correct. Let me verify again. For k=45, the p's are from ceil(44.5²) = ceil(1980.25) = 1981 up to min(2007, floor(45.5² - epsilon)) = 2007. Therefore, the number of terms is 2007 - 1981 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n2007 - 1981 = 26, then +1 is 27. Yes, that's correct. So 27 terms. \n\nBut let me check if there isn't an off-by-one error here. Let's take a smaller example. For k=2, p ranges from 3 to 6. 6 - 3 +1 = 4, which is correct (3,4,5,6). Similarly, for k=1, from 1 to 2, 2 -1 +1=2. Correct. So yes, formula holds. Therefore, 27 terms for k=45. \n\nTherefore, total sum is 58,740 + 1,215 = 59,955. \n\nBut wait, before I get confident, let me check if my initial assumption about the number of terms per k is correct. For each k, the number of p's is 2k. For example, k=1: 2 terms, correct. k=2: 4 terms, correct. Let me check for k=3. The interval is (2.5, 3.5) for sqrt(p). Squared, that is 6.25 to 12.25. Therefore p from 7 to 12. Let me count: 7,8,9,10,11,12. That's 6 numbers, which is 2*3=6. Correct. So yes, seems correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, for k from 1 to 44, each contributes 2k terms. \n\nBut let me check for k=44. What is the upper bound? For k=44, upper bound is 44^2 + 44 = 1936 + 44 = 1980. So p goes up to 1980. Then for k=45, starts at 1981. Which matches with our previous calculation. Therefore, all good. \n\nTherefore, total sum is 59,955. Now, need to compute 59,955 mod 1000. Which is equivalent to finding the remainder when divided by 1000, which is the last three digits. \n\nLet me compute 59,955 divided by 1000. 1000*59 = 59,000. 59,955 - 59,000 = 955. Therefore, the remainder is 955. Therefore, the answer is 955. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify this with another approach, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sum calculations. \n\nFirst, let me check the sum from k=1 to 44 of 2k². The formula is [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)] / 3 where n=44. Let me recalculate:\n\nn(n + 1)(2n + 1) for n=44:\n\nFirst compute 2n + 1 = 89. Then compute 44 * 45 * 89. \n\nLet me compute 44 * 45 first. 44*45 = (40*45) + (4*45) = 1800 + 180 = 1980. Then 1980 * 89. Let me do 1980 * 90 = 178,200 minus 1980 gives 178,200 - 1,980 = 176,220. Then divide by 3: 176,220 / 3. \n\nDividing step by step: 176,220 divided by 3. 3*58,000 = 174,000. Subtract 174,000 from 176,220, we get 2,220. 2,220 divided by 3 is 740. Therefore total is 58,000 + 740 = 58,740. Correct. Then adding 27*45=1,215. 58,740 + 1,215: 58,740 + 1,200 = 59,940, plus 15 is 59,955. Correct. \n\nThen 59,955 divided by 1000 is 59*1000=59,000, remainder 955. \n\nBut let me check again if there is a miscalculation here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me check with a small n. Let me take n=2. Then sum from k=1 to 2 of 2k² is 2(1² + 2²) = 2(1 + 4)= 10. According to formula [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)] / 3. For n=2: [2*3*5]/3 = 30 / 3 = 10. Correct. So formula is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of terms for k=45? Let me check again. \n\nFor k=45, p starts at ceil( (45 - 0.5)^2 ) = ceil(44.5²) = ceil(1980.25) = 1981. Ends at min(2007, floor( (45 + 0.5)^2 )) = min(2007, floor(45.5²)) = min(2007, 2070) = 2007. Number of terms is 2007 - 1981 + 1 = 27. Correct. \n\nBut let me check with k=45, the value of b(p). For p=1980.25, sqrt(p)=44.5. Therefore, |k - sqrt(p)| < 0.5. For p=1981, sqrt(1981) is slightly more than 44.5. Let me check sqrt(1980.25) = 44.5, so sqrt(1981) ≈ 44.5 + delta. Then |45 - sqrt(1981)| ≈ |45 - 44.5 - delta| = |0.5 - delta|. Since 1981 is 0.75 above 1980.25, so approximating delta using derivative: d(sqrt(x))/dx = 1/(2sqrt(x)). At x=1980.25, derivative is 1/(2*44.5) ≈ 1/89 ≈ 0.0112. Therefore delta ≈ 0.75 * 0.0112 ≈ 0.0084. Therefore, |0.5 - 0.0084| ≈ 0.4916 < 0.5. Therefore, yes, p=1981 is in k=45. Similarly, for p=2007, sqrt(2007). Let me check how far it is from 45.5. 45.5^2 = 2070.25. 2007 is 2070.25 - 2007 = 63.25 less. So sqrt(2007) is 45.5 - delta. Let me approximate delta. Again, derivative at x=2070.25 is 1/(2*45.5) ≈ 1/91 ≈ 0.011. Therefore delta ≈ 63.25 * 0.011 ≈ 0.695. Therefore sqrt(2007) ≈ 45.5 - 0.695 ≈ 44.805. Therefore, |45 - 44.805| = 0.195 < 0.5. Therefore, yes, p=2007 is indeed in k=45. Therefore, the calculation for the number of terms is correct. \n\nTherefore, the total sum is indeed 59,955, and mod 1000 is 955. However, just to be thorough, let me check with another approach. \n\nAlternative approach: Let me compute the values step by step for smaller k and check. \n\nFor example, let's compute the sum up to p=6. \n\nFrom k=1: p=1,2. Sum contribution: 1+1=2.\n\nFrom k=2: p=3,4,5,6. Sum contribution: 2+2+2+2=8.\n\nTotal sum up to p=6 is 2 + 8 = 10. If we compute via formula: sum from k=1 to n where n is such that k^2 +k <= 6. Let's see:\n\nk=1: 1 + 1 = 2 <= 6. k=2: 4 + 2 = 6. So n=2. Therefore sum from k=1 to 2 of 2k² = 2(1 + 4) = 10. Correct. \n\nAnother check: up to p=12 (k=3's upper bound is 3^2 + 3 = 12). So sum from k=1 to 3 of 2k² = 2(1 + 4 + 9) = 2(14) = 28. Let's check manually:\n\nk=1: p=1,2: sum=2\n\nk=2: p=3-6: sum=8\n\nk=3: p=7-12: sum= 3*6=18. Total: 2 + 8 + 18=28. Correct. \n\nSo formula works here. \n\nTherefore, seems like my approach is correct. \n\nBut let me check for k=44. What is the upper bound? 44² + 44 = 1936 + 44 = 1980. Then p=1980 is included in k=44. Let me check b(1980). \n\nCompute sqrt(1980). Let's see, 44.5² = 1980.25, so sqrt(1980) is 44.5 - epsilon. Therefore, |k - sqrt(1980)| for k=44: |44 - sqrt(1980)| ≈ |44 - (44.5 - epsilon)| = 0.5 - epsilon < 0.5? Wait, 0.5 - epsilon is less than 0.5? Well, if epsilon is positive, then yes. Therefore, p=1980 is in k=44. Therefore, correct. \n\nTherefore, the upper bound for k=44 is indeed 1980. \n\nTherefore, calculations are correct. \n\nTherefore, S=59,955. Then 59,955 divided by 1000 is 59*1000 + 955. Therefore, remainder is 955. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check the total number of terms. The total number of p's should be 2007. Let's check:\n\nSum from k=1 to 44 of 2k + 27. \n\nSum_{k=1}^n 2k = 2*(n(n+1)/2) = n(n+1). For n=44: 44*45 = 1980. Then adding 27 gives 1980 + 27 = 2007. Perfect, that's exactly the number of terms. Therefore, the calculation is consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The remainder when 59,955 is divided by 1000 is 955. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 59,955 divided by 1000:\n\n59,955 / 1000 = 59.955, so the integer part is 59, 59*1000 = 59,000. Subtract that from 59,955: 59,955 - 59,000 = 955. Yep. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 955. \n\nWait, but hold on, the problem says \"For each positive integer p, let b(p) denote the unique positive integer k such that |k - sqrt(p)| < 1/2\". Let me check if there's any edge case where my calculation might have missed something. For example, when k=1, p=1: |1 - sqrt(1)| = 0 < 0.5, correct. p=2: |1 - sqrt(2)| ≈ |1 - 1.414| ≈ 0.414 < 0.5, correct. p=3: |2 - sqrt(3)| ≈ |2 - 1.732| ≈ 0.268 < 0.5, correct. p= (k + 0.5)^2: For example, p= (k + 0.5)^2 would be exactly at the boundary. But since p must be integer, and (k + 0.5)^2 = k² + k + 0.25, which is not integer, so there's no p at the upper boundary. Similarly for lower boundary. Therefore, all p's are strictly inside the intervals. Therefore, no issues. \n\nAnother check: Let me check for k=45, the first p is 1981. Let me check |45 - sqrt(1981)|. sqrt(1981) ≈ 44.5 (since 44.5²=1980.25). Therefore sqrt(1981) ≈ 44.5 + (1981 - 1980.25)/(2*44.5) ≈ 44.5 + 0.75 / 89 ≈ 44.5 + 0.0084 ≈ 44.5084. Then |45 - 44.5084| ≈ 0.4916 < 0.5. Correct. Similarly, for p=2007, sqrt(2007) ≈ 44.805 as before, so |45 - 44.805| ≈ 0.195 < 0.5. Correct. \n\nTherefore, calculations are correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is 955. However, to be absolutely thorough, let me check if there is an error in the formula for the sum. \n\nThe formula for the sum from k=1 to n of 2k² is [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)] / 3. Wait, let me confirm with n=2: [2*3*5]/3=30/3=10. Which matches 2(1² + 2²)=10. Correct. For n=1: [1*2*3]/3=6/3=2. Which is 2(1²)=2. Correct. Therefore formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, with n=44, the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 955. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{955}\n</think>"}
