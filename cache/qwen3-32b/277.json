Let me start by recalling what I know about rotational motion. \n\nFirst, the sphere has a moment of inertia I = 0.06 kg·m². It's spinning at an angular speed of 20 rad/s. We want to bring it to rest, so the final angular velocity will be 0 rad/s. The friction force applied is 2.0 N, acting at a distance of 0.30 m from the center. \n\nHmm, okay. So, when a force is applied tangentially to a rotating object, it creates a torque. Torque is related to the moment of inertia and angular acceleration by the equation τ = Iα. Since we want to stop the sphere, the torque should be opposing the rotation, causing an angular deceleration. \n\nLet me write down the known quantities:\n\n- Moment of inertia, I = 0.06 kg·m²\n- Initial angular velocity, ω₀ = 20 rad/s\n- Final angular velocity, ω = 0 rad/s\n- Friction force, F = 2.0 N\n- Radius (distance from center), r = 0.30 m\n\nFirst, I need to find the torque caused by the friction force. Torque τ is given by τ = r × F. Since the force is applied tangentially and perpendicular to the radius, the cross product simplifies to τ = rF. \n\nCalculating torque: τ = 0.30 m * 2.0 N = 0.6 N·m. \n\nBut wait, torque is a vector quantity, and since it's opposing the rotation, it should have a negative sign if we consider the initial angular velocity as positive. But maybe I can just consider magnitudes here since I'm interested in the magnitude of angular acceleration. \n\nNext, using τ = Iα, we can solve for angular acceleration α: α = τ / I. \n\nSo α = 0.6 N·m / 0.06 kg·m². Let me compute that. 0.6 divided by 0.06 is 10. So α = 10 rad/s². Wait, but since the torque is opposing the rotation, it should be negative, so α = -10 rad/s². \n\nNow, to find the time it takes to come to rest, I can use the rotational kinematics equation similar to linear motion: ω = ω₀ + αt. \n\nWe need to solve for t. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\nt = (ω - ω₀) / α\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nt = (0 - 20 rad/s) / (-10 rad/s²) = (-20) / (-10) = 2 seconds.\n\nSo the time should be 2 seconds. Let me check the options. Option B is 2 s. That seems right. \n\nWait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. \n\nFirst, torque calculation: r * F. 0.3 m * 2 N is indeed 0.6 N·m. \n\nMoment of inertia is given as 0.06 kg·m². Then angular acceleration is τ / I = 0.6 / 0.06. Let me do that division again. 0.06 times 10 is 0.6, so yes, 10 rad/s². Since torque is opposing the motion, angular acceleration is negative. \n\nThen using ω = ω₀ + αt. The initial angular velocity is positive 20 rad/s. The final is 0. So solving for t gives (0 - 20)/(-10) = 2 seconds. \n\nYes, that seems correct. The answer should be B: 2 seconds. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The key was relating torque to angular acceleration and then using kinematics to find the time. The numbers work out. So I think B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
