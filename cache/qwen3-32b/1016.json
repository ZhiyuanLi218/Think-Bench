The key steps are:\n\n1. **Hydrolysis of Sucrose**:\n   - 1 mL of 20% sucrose + 3 drops of dilute sulfuric acid.\n   - Heated in a water bath for 5 minutes.\n\n2. **Preparation of Fehling’s-like Reagent**:\n   - 1 mL of 10% NaOH + 5 drops of 2% CuSO₄.\n   - Stopper of the NaOH bottle is **inverted** before use.\n\n3. **Combination and Final Test**:\n   - The Fehling’s-like reagent (from test tube II) is added to test tube I.\n   - The mixture is **heated with an alcohol lamp**.\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying Errors in the Procedure**\n\nLet’s now break down the **key errors** in the experiment:\n\n#### **1. Inverting the Glass Stopper of the NaOH Bottle**\n- **Error Type**: Procedural (contamination risk).\n- **Explanation**: Inverting the glass stopper of the reagent bottle can introduce **contaminants** from the stopper into the solution. This is a standard violation of lab safety and good technique. It can compromise the purity of the NaOH solution, affecting the Fehling's test.\n- **Conclusion**: This is a **valid error**.\n\n#### **2. Improper Preparation of Fehling’s Reagent**\n- **Error Type**: Chemical (incorrect reagent preparation).\n- **Explanation**: Fehling’s reagent requires a **specific ratio** of CuSO₄ to NaOH to form a **deep blue alkaline solution**. Simply adding **5 drops of 2% CuSO₄ to 1 mL of 10% NaOH** is not sufficient to ensure a proper concentration of copper ions for the test. This may lead to an **insufficient or incorrect reaction** when detecting the reducing sugar (glucose).\n- **Conclusion**: This is a **valid error**.\n\n#### **3. Direct Heating with an Alcohol Lamp Instead of a Water Bath**\n- **Error Type**: Chemical (incorrect reaction conditions).\n- **Explanation**: When performing the **Fehling’s test**, it is standard practice to **heat the solution in a water bath**, not directly with a flame. Direct heating can cause **decomposition of Cu(OH)₂** into CuO, which does not react with the reducing sugar. This can lead to a **false-negative** result or **unreliable observations**.\n- **Conclusion**: This is a **valid error**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Errors**\n\n| Error Type | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| 1 | Inverted the glass stopper when taking NaOH solution (contamination risk) |\n| 2 | Insufficient CuSO₄ in the Fehling’s reagent (improper preparation) |\n| 3 | Used an alcohol lamp for heating instead of a water bath (improper heating method) |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThere are **three errors** in the described experimental procedure.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many errors are in this experiment. The student is doing a sucrose hydrolysis and testing for the aldehyde group. Let me recall what I know about this.\n\nFirst, sucrose is a disaccharide made of glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis of sucrose requires an acid catalyst, like sulfuric acid, and heating. The products are glucose and fructose. Now, to test for the aldehyde group, which is present in glucose (a reducing sugar), they might be using Fehling's test or Benedict's test. These tests usually require an alkaline environment because the copper(II) ions need to be in an alkaline solution to form the necessary complexes for the reaction.\n\nLooking at the procedure:\n\nTest tube I: 1 mL 20% sucrose + 3 drops dilute sulfuric acid + heat in water bath for 5 minutes. Then they take the reaction solution from test tube II and add it to test tube I, then heat with an alcohol lamp.\n\nTest tube II: They take 1 mL 10% NaOH, add 5 drops of 2% CuSO4. Then they add this solution to test tube I.\n\nWait, so test tube II is probably making a Fehling's solution or something similar. Normally, Fehling's solution is a mix of copper sulfate, sodium potassium tartrate, and sodium hydroxide. But here, they just mix NaOH and CuSO4. If you mix NaOH and CuSO4, you get a blue precipitate of Cu(OH)2. But in an alkaline solution, that might not be enough for the test. Also, for the test, the solution needs to be alkaline to allow the copper ions to react with the reducing sugar.\n\nNow, let's check the steps for errors.\n\nFirst error possibility: When adding the NaOH to test tube II, they invert the glass stopper. Inverting the stopper could lead to contamination if the stopper was not clean. But maybe that's a minor error, but in lab practice, you should not invert the stopper to avoid contamination. However, maybe the question is more about chemical errors rather than procedural contamination. Not sure yet.\n\nSecond error: The student is hydrolyzing sucrose with acid, then adding NaOH and CuSO4. But after hydrolysis, the solution is acidic (since sulfuric acid was used). To test for the aldehyde group, you need an alkaline environment. So after hydrolysis, they should neutralize the acid with NaOH before adding the Fehling's reagent. However, in the procedure, they take the reaction solution from test tube II (which is NaOH + CuSO4) and add it to test tube I (the hydrolyzed sucrose solution). Adding NaOH to the acidic solution would neutralize it, but maybe they didn't add enough NaOH. Let's see: test tube I has 1 mL of 20% sucrose + 3 drops of dilute H2SO4. Then test tube II has 1 mL of 10% NaOH + 5 drops of CuSO4. Then they add test tube II's solution to test tube I. So the NaOH is being added to the acidic solution. But if the amount of NaOH is sufficient to neutralize the acid, then the solution becomes alkaline, allowing the CuSO4 to react with the reducing sugar. However, the problem is that the hydrolysis was done in acidic conditions, and after hydrolysis, the acid needs to be neutralized before adding the Fehling's reagent. If they just add the NaOH solution to the hydrolyzed solution, maybe they didn't neutralize the acid properly. Let me check the volumes. Test tube I has 1 mL of sucrose + 3 drops of H2SO4. Test tube II has 1 mL of 10% NaOH + 5 drops of CuSO4. Then test tube II's solution (which is 1 mL NaOH + 5 drops CuSO4) is added to test tube I. The volume of acid is 3 drops. Assuming each drop is about 0.05 mL, that's 0.15 mL of H2SO4. The NaOH is 1 mL of 10% solution. If the H2SO4 is dilute, say 0.1 M or something, and the NaOH is 10% which is roughly 1.25 M (since 10% NaOH is about 10 g in 100 mL, which is 100 g/L, molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol, so 100/40 = 2.5 M). Wait, 10% NaOH is about 2.5 M? Let me calculate: 10% (w/v) means 10 g per 100 mL, so 100 g per liter. Molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol. So 100 g/L / 40 g/mol = 2.5 mol/L. So 2.5 M. The sulfuric acid is dilute, but how much? The problem says \"dilute sulfuric acid,\" but doesn't specify concentration. Let's assume it's, say, 1 M for estimation. The volume is 3 drops = 0.15 mL = 0.00015 L. Moles of H2SO4: 1 M * 0.00015 L = 0.00015 moles. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, it would provide 0.0003 moles of H+.\n\nThe NaOH in test tube II is 1 mL of 2.5 M solution. Moles of NaOH: 2.5 M * 0.001 L = 0.0025 moles. So if you add all of test tube II to test tube I, the NaOH would neutralize the acid. The NaOH is in excess. So maybe the acid is properly neutralized. Then the solution would be alkaline, allowing the CuSO4 to react with the reducing sugar (glucose). So maybe that part is okay.\n\nAnother possible error: The student is using 5 drops of CuSO4. Normally, Fehling's solution has a specific ratio of CuSO4 to NaOH. If they just add 5 drops of CuSO4 to 1 mL of NaOH, maybe the concentration is not right. For example, Fehling's solution typically is a deep blue solution where copper ions are in a certain concentration. Adding just a few drops might not provide enough Cu2+ ions for the reaction. But the question is whether this is considered an error. If the student is supposed to make a proper Fehling's reagent, then this is an error. However, sometimes in lab experiments, a simplified version is used. But in standard tests, you need a proper alkaline copper solution. So maybe that's an error.\n\nAnother error: After hydrolysis, they are adding the Fehling's reagent (test tube II) to test tube I and then heating. But normally, after hydrolysis, you need to neutralize the acid before adding the Fehling's reagent. Wait, but in the procedure, they added NaOH to the hydrolyzed solution. So the NaOH is added to neutralize the acid. But the problem is that when you hydrolyze sucrose with acid, you need to neutralize the acid with a base before testing for the reducing sugar, because the acidic conditions can interfere with the test. So in the procedure, they added the NaOH solution (test tube II) to test tube I, which should neutralize the acid. If that's done properly, then maybe it's okay. But if the student didn't neutralize properly, but according to the volumes, the NaOH is in excess, so maybe it's okay.\n\nWait, but maybe the student should have first neutralized the acid before adding the Fehling's reagent. However, in the procedure, they added the Fehling's reagent (which contains NaOH and CuSO4) to the hydrolyzed solution. Since the NaOH is part of the Fehling's reagent, adding it to the acidic solution would neutralize the acid. So that's correct. So that step is okay.\n\nAnother possible error: The student is using an alcohol lamp to heat test tube I after adding the Fehling's reagent. Normally, for Fehling's test, you heat the solution in a water bath, not directly with a flame, because direct heating can cause the copper hydroxide to decompose or other side reactions. So heating with an alcohol lamp (direct heating) might be an error. Instead, they should heat in a water bath again, similar to the initial hydrolysis step. So that's a possible error.\n\nSo possible errors:\n\n1. Using an alcohol lamp for heating after adding Fehling's reagent instead of a water bath. Direct heating might not be appropriate for the Fehling's test.\n\n2. The preparation of Fehling's reagent: adding only 5 drops of CuSO4 to 1 mL of NaOH might not be sufficient to create the correct concentration for the test. Normally, Fehling's reagent is a specific mixture, and just adding a few drops might not work.\n\n3. The student inverted the glass stopper when taking NaOH. This is a procedural error regarding contamination, but maybe not a chemical error. However, if the question counts this as an error, that's another one.\n\nWait, the question is about how many errors are in the experiment. Let's list possible errors:\n\nError 1: Not using a water bath for the Fehling's test, instead using direct heating with an alcohol lamp. This could cause decomposition of the reagent or other issues.\n\nError 2: Improper preparation of Fehling's reagent by using only 5 drops of CuSO4. The standard test requires a proper concentration.\n\nError 3: Inverting the glass stopper when taking NaOH, leading to potential contamination. But is this considered an error? In lab practice, yes, but maybe the question is more about the chemical steps. However, the options are given, and the answer is likely among 1-4 errors.\n\nAnother possible error: The student added the reaction solution from test tube II to test tube I. Test tube II contains NaOH and CuSO4. If the student added test tube II to test tube I, they are adding the Fehling's reagent to the hydrolyzed solution. But the hydrolyzed solution is in an acidic environment (from the sulfuric acid). Adding NaOH to neutralize the acid is correct, but the order might matter. However, the procedure seems okay because adding the NaOH (from test tube II) to test tube I would neutralize the acid. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another possible error: The student did not perform a control experiment. But the question is about errors in the described procedure, not about missing controls.\n\nAnother possible error: The student used dilute sulfuric acid for hydrolysis. Is that correct? Yes, acid catalyzes hydrolysis. So that's okay.\n\nAnother possible error: The student heated the hydrolysis in a water bath for 5 minutes. Is that sufficient? Maybe, but the question isn't about that. The question is about errors in the procedure.\n\nSo going back to the possible errors:\n\n1. Direct heating with an alcohol lamp for the Fehling's test instead of a water bath. This is likely an error.\n\n2. Improper preparation of Fehling's reagent by using only 5 drops of CuSO4 in 1 mL of NaOH. This might not provide enough CuSO4 for the reaction. Normally, Fehling's solution is a specific concentration. So this is another error.\n\n3. Inverting the glass stopper when taking NaOH solution, which could lead to contamination. Depending on the context, this might be considered an error. In a lab, you should not invert the stopper to avoid contamination. So that's a procedural error.\n\nBut the options are (A)1, (B)2, (C)3, (D)4. So if there are three errors, the answer would be C. But let me check again.\n\nThe first error: Direct heating with alcohol lamp instead of water bath. Yes, that's an error because Fehling's test is usually done in a water bath.\n\nSecond error: Using only 5 drops of CuSO4. This might be insufficient. Let's think: Test tube II is 1 mL of 10% NaOH plus 5 drops of 2% CuSO4. If the student is supposed to make a Fehling's reagent, which typically requires a certain ratio of copper sulfate to sodium hydroxide, then using only 5 drops might not provide enough copper ions. For example, in standard Fehling's solution, you have about 0.1 M CuSO4. If the student adds only 5 drops (say 0.25 mL) of 2% CuSO4 to 1 mL of NaOH, the concentration might be too low. So this is an error.\n\nThird error: Inverting the stopper when taking NaOH. This is a procedural error, but is it considered a mistake in the experiment? In lab exams, yes, because it can contaminate the reagent. So that's a third error.\n\nFourth possible error: Adding the reaction solution from test tube II to test tube I. Wait, test tube II contains NaOH and CuSO4. Adding this to test tube I (which has the hydrolyzed sucrose in acid) would neutralize the acid with NaOH. But the problem is that when you add the NaOH solution to the acidic solution, the NaOH will neutralize the acid, but the timing might be an issue. However, according to the volumes, the NaOH is in excess, so that's okay. So maybe that's not an error.\n\nSo total errors: three (direct heating, insufficient CuSO4, inverting stopper). Therefore, the answer is C)3.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe the inverting stopper is not considered an error in the context of the question. The question is about the experiment's errors in terms of chemical testing. The inverting stopper is a lab technique error but might not affect the chemical outcome unless the NaOH was contaminated. However, if the question counts that as an error, then three errors. If not, then two errors. But the options are up to four. Let me think again.\n\nAnother possible error: The student added 3 drops of dilute sulfuric acid. Is that enough for hydrolysis? Maybe, but the question is not about that. The hydrolysis was done in a water bath for 5 minutes. Maybe insufficient time or acid, but the question doesn't specify. The problem is about the errors in the described procedure. So maybe not.\n\nSo the main errors are:\n\n1. Direct heating with alcohol lamp instead of water bath for Fehling's test.\n\n2. Improper Fehling's reagent preparation (insufficient CuSO4).\n\n3. Inverting the stopper when taking NaOH.\n\nThus, three errors. Answer C)3.\n\nBut wait, another thought: When the student added test tube II (NaOH + CuSO4) to test tube I (hydrolyzed sucrose), the order might be reversed. Normally, you should add the Fehling's reagent to the sample. But in this case, the student did add it. So that's correct. No error there.\n\nAnother point: The student first hydrolyzed the sucrose with acid, then neutralized with NaOH before adding the Fehling's reagent. That is correct because the Fehling's test requires alkaline conditions. So that part is okay. The neutralization is done by adding the NaOH solution (test tube II) to test tube I. Since the NaOH is in excess, it's okay. So no error there.\n\nSo the three errors are:\n\n1. Inverting the stopper when taking NaOH.\n\n2. Using only 5 drops of CuSO4 for Fehling's reagent.\n\n3. Direct heating with alcohol lamp instead of water bath.\n\nTherefore, answer is C)3. But let me check the options again: (A)1, (B)2, (C)3, (D)4. So the answer is C.\n</think>"}
