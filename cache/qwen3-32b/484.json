The problem says that when the triangle is rotated about one leg, the volume of the cone formed is 800π cm³, and when rotated about the other leg, the volume is 1920π cm³. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you rotate a right triangle around one of its legs, it forms a cone. The leg around which you rotate becomes the height of the cone, and the other leg becomes the radius of the base of the cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h, right?\n\nSo let me denote the legs of the triangle as, say, 'a' and 'b'. Let's say when we rotate around leg 'a', the volume is 800π. That would make 'a' the height of the cone, and 'b' the radius. Similarly, when rotating around leg 'b', then 'b' becomes the height and 'a' becomes the radius, giving a volume of 1920π.\n\nSo translating that into equations, for the first case:\n\nVolume1 = (1/3)πb²a = 800π\n\nAnd for the second case:\n\nVolume2 = (1/3)πa²b = 1920π\n\nOkay, so I can write these equations without the π:\n\n(1/3)b²a = 800  --> Multiply both sides by 3: b²a = 2400 ...(1)\n\n(1/3)a²b = 1920 --> Multiply both sides by 3: a²b = 5760 ...(2)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) b²a = 2400\n\n2) a²b = 5760\n\nI need to solve these equations for a and b, then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, which would be sqrt(a² + b²).\n\nHmm, how to solve these equations? Maybe divide one equation by the other to eliminate variables?\n\nLet me try dividing equation (2) by equation (1):\n\n(a²b) / (b²a) = 5760 / 2400\n\nSimplify left side: (a² / b²) * (b / a) = (a / b) * (a / b) * (b / a) = (a / b)\n\nSo left side is a/b, and right side is 5760 / 2400. Let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 576 / 240\n\nDivide by 24: 24 / 10, which is 12 / 5. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait 5760 ÷ 2400: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 240: 5760 ÷ 240 = 24, and 2400 ÷ 240 = 10. So 24/10 = 12/5 = 2.4. So:\n\na / b = 12 / 5\n\nTherefore, a = (12/5) * b\n\nOkay, so now I can substitute this into one of the equations. Let's take equation (1):\n\nb²a = 2400\n\nSubstitute a = (12/5)b:\n\nb²*(12/5)b = 2400\n\nWhich is (12/5) * b³ = 2400\n\nMultiply both sides by 5/12:\n\nb³ = 2400 * (5/12) = 2400 / 12 * 5 = 200 * 5 = 1000\n\nTherefore, b³ = 1000 => b = cube root of 1000 = 10 cm\n\nThen, since a = (12/5)*b, so a = (12/5)*10 = 24 cm\n\nSo the legs are 10 cm and 24 cm. Then the hypotenuse is sqrt(24² + 10²).\n\nCompute that:\n\n24 squared is 576, 10 squared is 100. Sum is 676. Square root of 676 is 26. So hypotenuse is 26 cm.\n\nWait, let me check if these values satisfy both equations.\n\nFirst equation: b²a = 10² * 24 = 100 * 24 = 2400. Correct.\n\nSecond equation: a²b = 24² * 10 = 576 * 10 = 5760. Correct. Perfect.\n\nSo hypotenuse is 26 cm. Therefore, the answer is 26.\n\nBut let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations.\n\nStarting with the two volumes, set up equations, divided them to find the ratio of a/b, solved for one variable in terms of the other, substituted back, solved for b, then found a, then used Pythagoras. All steps seem logical. Let me check the division step again.\n\nDividing equation (2) by equation (1):\n\n(a²b)/(b²a) = a/b, yes. And 5760 / 2400 = 2.4 = 12/5. Correct. So a/b = 12/5. Then substitution gives us b³ = 1000. All correct.\n\nAnother way to check: if a is 24 and b is 10, then rotating around a (24 cm) gives a cone with radius 10 cm and height 24 cm. Volume is (1/3)π*(10)^2*24 = (1/3)*π*100*24 = (1/3)*2400π = 800π. Correct. Rotating around b (10 cm) gives radius 24 cm and height 10 cm. Volume is (1/3)π*(24)^2*10 = (1/3)*π*576*10 = (1/3)*5760π = 1920π. Correct. So the values are correct.\n\nTherefore, hypotenuse is sqrt(24² + 10²) = sqrt(576 + 100) = sqrt(676) = 26. Yep, 26 cm. So the answer is 26 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe length of the hypotenuse is \\boxed{26} centimeters.\n</think>"}
