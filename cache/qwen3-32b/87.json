And also find the related expression for energy levels. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the free motion equation is. In quantum mechanics, the free motion equation would be the Schrödinger equation without any potential, right? But wait, the question says \"free motion equation satisfied at a position far from a two-dimensional shallow potential well.\" So, if the particle is far from the well, the potential U(r) should be negligible, meaning we can approximate U(r) as zero in that region. Therefore, the problem reduces to solving the free Schrödinger equation in two dimensions. \n\nBut maybe I need to consider the full Schrödinger equation first, and then take the limit as r approaches infinity? Let me think. The time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions is:\n\n- (ħ²/2m) ∇²ψ(r) + U(r)ψ(r) = Eψ(r)\n\nWhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle, E is the energy, and ψ(r) is the wavefunction. Since the potential is shallow and we are considering positions far from the well, U(r) tends to zero as r approaches infinity. Therefore, far away, the equation becomes:\n\n- (ħ²/2m) ∇²ψ(r) = Eψ(r)\n\nOr rearranged:\n\n∇²ψ(r) + (2mE/ħ²)ψ(r) = 0\n\nThis is the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. The solutions to this equation are typically Bessel functions or modified Bessel functions, depending on the boundary conditions. But since we are dealing with free motion, which is usually associated with scattering or propagating waves, maybe plane waves or cylindrical waves?\n\nWait, in two dimensions, plane waves can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions when we switch to polar coordinates. Let me recall. In polar coordinates (r, θ), the Laplacian ∇² is:\n\n(1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ²\n\nSo, the Helmholtz equation becomes:\n\n[ (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ² + k² ] ψ(r, θ) = 0\n\nWhere k² = 2mE/ħ². To solve this, we can use separation of variables. Let me assume ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Θ(θ). Plugging into the equation:\n\n(1/r) [Θ d/dr (r dR/dr) ] + (1/r²) [R d²Θ/dθ²] + k² RΘ = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by r²/(RΘ):\n\n( r/R d/dr (r dR/dr) ) + (1/Θ d²Θ/dθ² ) + k² r² = 0\n\nThis separates into radial and angular parts. Let me denote the angular part as:\n\n(1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² = -m²\n\nWhere m² is the separation constant. Therefore, the angular equation is:\n\nd²Θ/dθ² + m² Θ = 0\n\nWhich has solutions Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ}, where m is an integer (to ensure single-valuedness of the wavefunction when θ increases by 2π). So m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...\n\nThen the radial equation becomes:\n\n(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) + [k² - (m²)/r²] R = 0\n\nThis is Bessel's equation of order m. The general solution is a combination of Bessel functions of the first and second kind:\n\nR(r) = A J_m(kr) + B Y_m(kr)\n\nBut for free motion, if we are considering scattering states or states at large distances, we might need to consider the asymptotic forms of these Bessel functions. However, the question mentions \"free motion equation satisfied at a position far from...\" so maybe we are to consider the behavior as r approaches infinity?\n\nThe asymptotic form of J_m(kr) and Y_m(kr) for large r is:\n\nJ_m(kr) ≈ sqrt(2/(π kr)) cos(kr - m π/2 - π/4)\n\nY_m(kr) ≈ sqrt(2/(π kr)) sin(kr - m π/2 - π/4)\n\nSo they both behave like sinusoidal functions with amplitude decaying as 1/sqrt(r). But if the potential is shallow and we are considering bound states? Wait, hold on. The question says \"free motion equation\", which usually refers to scattering states with positive energy. However, if we are looking for energy levels, that usually refers to bound states with negative energy. There's a contradiction here. Wait, let me check again.\n\nThe problem says \"free motion equation satisfied at a position far from a two-dimensional shallow potential well\". So maybe the particle is in a bound state, but we are looking at the solution far away from the well where the potential is negligible. For a bound state, the energy E is negative. However, in that case, the equation would be:\n\n∇²ψ(r) + (2m(E - U(r))/ħ²)ψ(r) = 0\n\nBut far from the well, U(r) ≈ 0, so if E is negative, then we have:\n\n∇²ψ(r) - |k|² ψ(r) = 0\n\nWhere |k|² = -2mE/ħ². This is the modified Helmholtz equation, whose solutions are modified Bessel functions. In two dimensions, the solutions would be I_m(|k|r) and K_m(|k|r). However, for bound states, the wavefunction must be finite everywhere and go to zero at infinity. Therefore, the solution far from the well should decay exponentially. The modified Bessel function K_m(|k|r) decays exponentially for large r, whereas I_m(|k|r) grows exponentially. So the solution would be proportional to K_m(|k|r). But in two dimensions, the asymptotic form of K_m(z) for large z is sqrt(π/(2z)) e^{-z}. So that decays exponentially.\n\nBut the problem says \"free motion equation\". If \"free motion\" refers to scattering states, then E is positive, and we have oscillatory solutions. However, if we are talking about energy levels, that usually refers to bound states. The question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original question again: \"Determine the solution of the free motion equation satisfied at a position far from a two-dimensional shallow potential well U = U(r) and the related expression for energy levels.\"\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is about bound states (energy levels) in a shallow potential, and we need to find the solution far from the well (which would be the decaying exponential) and relate it to the energy levels. So perhaps it's a bound state problem. In that case, the wavefunction at large r is given by the modified Bessel function K_m(|k|r), decaying as e^{-|k|r}/sqrt(r). \n\nBut how do we relate this to energy levels? For a shallow potential, we can use the Born approximation or some method to find the bound state energies. However, in two dimensions, the treatment of bound states is a bit different from three dimensions. In 2D, even a shallow potential can have bound states, but the quantization condition would need to be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the free motion equation as the Schrödinger equation without potential, but the energy levels would be related to the quantization due to boundary conditions. However, for free motion in 2D, unless there are boundary conditions, the energy is continuous. But the question mentions \"energy levels\", implying discrete energy levels. Therefore, it must be referring to bound states in the shallow potential, and the solution far from the well is part of the matching condition to find those energy levels.\n\nSo, to approach this, I need to consider a particle in a two-dimensional potential well U(r), which is shallow. The wavefunction must satisfy the Schrödinger equation inside and outside the well, and match at the boundary. Since the well is shallow and we are far from it, the solution outside would be the decaying modified Bessel function. \n\nBut since the problem is about a two-dimensional potential, let me think about the standard approach for bound states in 2D. For example, in 2D hydrogen or a 2D square well. Let me consider a square well potential in 2D: U(r) = -V_0 for r < a, and 0 for r > a. But the problem says it's a shallow potential, so maybe V_0 is small. However, the exact form of U(r) is not given, just that it's a two-dimensional shallow potential well. Therefore, perhaps the solution requires a general approach or an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the free motion equation as the Schrödinger equation with E=0? No, that might not be it. Let me try to think again.\n\nThe question is about the solution of the free motion equation at a position far from the well. So if the particle is in a bound state, then far from the well, the wavefunction is governed by the free motion equation with E negative. So the solution is the modified Bessel function. Then, the energy levels are determined by matching the solution inside and outside the well. However, without knowing the exact form of U(r), how can we derive the energy levels? The problem mentions it's a \"shallow\" potential well, so maybe we can use some approximation, like the Born approximation or the weak potential limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the free motion equation in the sense of scattering, where the energy is positive, and the solution far away is an outgoing wave. But again, energy levels are usually for bound states. Maybe the question is mixing terms? Or perhaps in this context, \"free motion\" refers to the motion in the absence of potential, and the energy levels refer to something else?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in a context where the particle is in a bound state, but the free motion equation is the equation that the wavefunction satisfies in the region outside the potential well. Therefore, to find the energy levels, we need to match the interior solution (inside the well) with the exterior solution (free motion equation solution). Since the well is shallow, we can approximate the interior solution.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Write the Schrödinger equation for r > a (outside the well), where U(r) ≈ 0. The solution is a decaying modified Bessel function.\n\n2. Write the Schrödinger equation for r < a (inside the well), where U(r) = -V_0 (assuming a square well for simplicity), and solve it.\n\n3. Match the solutions at r = a, ensuring continuity of the wavefunction and its derivative.\n\n4. Use the shallow potential approximation (V_0 is small) to find an expression for the energy levels.\n\nHowever, since the problem states it's a general U(r) and not a square well, maybe we need a more general approach. Alternatively, maybe the shallow potential allows us to use a perturbative method or some approximation.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential is shallow and weak, there might be only a few bound states, perhaps just one, and we can use the effective range theory or some other method to approximate the energy levels.\n\nBut I need to recall how bound states in 2D work. In 2D, the Schrödinger equation for a radial potential is:\n\n- (ħ²/2m) [ (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) - (m² / r²) R ] + U(r) R = E R\n\nFor a bound state, E < 0. Let me define k² = -2mE/ħ², which is positive. Then, outside the potential (r > a), U(r) = 0, so the equation becomes:\n\n(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) - (m² / r²) R - k² R = 0\n\nWhich is the modified Bessel equation. The general solution is R(r) = A I_m(kr) + B K_m(kr). As mentioned before, I_m(kr) grows exponentially as r increases, while K_m(kr) decays. Since the wavefunction must be normalizable, we discard the I_m term, so R(r) ~ K_m(kr).\n\nInside the well (r < a), assuming U(r) = -V_0, then the energy is E = - (ħ² k²)/(2m), and the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n- (ħ²/2m) [ (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) - (m² / r²) R ] - V_0 R = - (ħ² k²)/(2m) R\n\nMultiply through by -2m/ħ²:\n\n[ (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) - (m² / r²) R ] + (2m V_0 / ħ²) R = k² R\n\nLet me define q² = 2m(V_0 - |E|)/ħ² = 2m(V_0 + ħ² k²/(2m))/ħ² = (2m V_0)/ħ² + k²\n\nTherefore, inside the well, the equation becomes:\n\n(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) - (m² / r²) R + q² R = 0\n\nWhich is the Bessel equation of order m. The solutions are J_m(qr) and Y_m(qr). However, since the potential is symmetric and we are looking for normalizable solutions, we might have to consider regular solutions at r=0. For m=0, Y_0(qr) is singular at r=0, so we discard it. For m ≠ 0, the same applies; we take J_m(qr).\n\nTherefore, the general solution inside the well is R(r) = C J_m(qr).\n\nMatching the interior and exterior solutions at r = a:\n\nContinuity of R(r): C J_m(q a) = A K_m(k a)\n\nContinuity of the derivative: C [ q J_m'(q a) ] = A [ k K_m'(k a) ]\n\nDividing the second equation by the first:\n\n[ q J_m'(q a) ] / J_m(q a) = [ k K_m'(k a) ] / K_m(k a)\n\nThis gives the quantization condition:\n\nq J_m'(q a) / J_m(q a) = k K_m'(k a) / K_m(k a)\n\nBut remember that q² = (2m V_0)/ħ² + k². This is a transcendental equation that determines the allowed k (and hence E) for each m.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the potential is shallow. Let's assume that the potential is shallow enough that only the ground state exists, or that we can approximate the solutions for small k. Also, since it's a shallow potential, maybe we can take the limit as V_0 approaches zero, but still having a bound state. However, in two dimensions, even an arbitrarily weak attractive potential can have a bound state. Wait, is that true? In three dimensions, there is a minimum depth required for a bound state, but in two dimensions, any attractive potential, no matter how shallow, has at least one bound state. Therefore, for a shallow potential, we can consider the case where the binding energy |E| is very small compared to V_0. But since V_0 is also small (shallow), maybe we can expand in terms of small parameters.\n\nLet me assume that the potential is very shallow and weak, so that both V_0 and |E| are small. However, in 2D, even if V_0 is very small, there is still a bound state. Let me consider the case for m=0, since the lowest energy state would have m=0 (angular momentum quantum number zero).\n\nFor m=0, the quantization condition becomes:\n\nq J_0'(q a) / J_0(q a) = k K_0'(k a) / K_0(k a)\n\nLet me recall some properties of Bessel functions. For J_0(z), the derivative is -J_1(z). Similarly, for K_0(z), the derivative is -K_1(z). Therefore:\n\nq [ -J_1(q a) / J_0(q a) ] = k [ -K_1(k a) / K_0(k a) ]\n\nSimplifying:\n\nq J_1(q a)/J_0(q a) = k K_1(k a)/K_0(k a)\n\nThis is still complicated, but maybe for a shallow potential, we can approximate these functions. Let's consider the case where k a is small (since the binding energy is small). However, if k is small, then q² = (2m V_0)/ħ² + k² ≈ (2m V_0)/ħ². But if V_0 is also small, then q might be small too. This seems a bit tangled. Maybe I need to make some approximations.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the binding energy |E| is very small, so k is small. Therefore, for the exterior solution, k a << 1. Let me expand K_0(k a) and K_1(k a) for small arguments. The modified Bessel functions for small z have expansions:\n\nK_0(z) ≈ -ln(z/2) - γ (for z → 0, where γ is Euler-Mascheroni constant)\n\nK_1(z) ≈ 1/z [1 + (z²/4)(ln(z/2) + γ - 1/2) + ...]\n\nBut since k a is small, maybe we can approximate:\n\nK_0(k a) ≈ -ln(k a / 2) - γ\n\nK_1(k a) ≈ 1/(k a) [1 - (ln(k a / 2) + γ)/2 + ...]\n\nSimilarly, the derivative K_0'(k a) = -K_1(k a), so:\n\nK_0'(k a)/K_0(k a) ≈ - [1/(k a) [1 - ... ] ] / [ -ln(k a / 2) - γ ] ≈ [1/(k a) ] / [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ]\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side of the quantization condition:\n\nk K_1(k a)/K_0(k a) ≈ k * [1/(k a)] / [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ] = 1/(a [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ])\n\nNow, for the left-hand side, we need to evaluate q J_1(q a)/J_0(q a). Let's recall that q² = (2m V_0)/ħ² + k². If the potential is shallow and the binding energy is small, maybe we can assume that q a is not necessarily small. However, if V_0 is small, then q² ≈ (2m V_0)/ħ². But if V_0 is also small, then q might be small. However, if we are considering the shallowest possible potential, where V_0 approaches zero, then q approaches k, since q² = k² + (small). But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the potential is shallow such that V_0 is small, but the binding energy |E| is also small. Let me define ε = |E| = ħ² k²/(2m), and V_0 is small. Let me assume that q a is large? No, if q² = 2m(V_0 - E)/ħ² ≈ 2m V_0 / ħ², and if V_0 is small, then q might be small or not depending on the relation between V_0 and a.\n\nThis is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to look for a known result for the 2D shallow potential. Alternatively, consider using the Born approximation or the effective range theory in 2D.\n\nAlternatively, think about the 2D Schrödinger equation with a weak potential and use perturbation theory. However, since we are dealing with bound states, perturbation theory might be tricky. Alternatively, use the variational method.\n\nBut the problem asks for the solution of the free motion equation (which we said is the modified Bessel function K_m(kr)) and the related expression for energy levels. Perhaps the energy levels can be found by considering the logarithmic derivative matching condition, and under the shallow potential approximation, we can approximate the interior solution.\n\nLet me try assuming that inside the potential well, since it's shallow, the wavefunction is approximately the same as the free particle solution but with a slightly modified wavenumber. However, this is vague. Alternatively, for a very shallow potential, the wavefunction inside the well is not highly oscillatory, so maybe we can expand the Bessel functions in terms of small arguments.\n\nAssuming that q a is small (since V_0 is small and a is the range of the potential), then inside the well, the solution is R(r) = C J_0(q r). For small q a, J_0(q r) ≈ 1 - (q r)^2 /4. Therefore, near the origin, the wavefunction is approximately flat. At r = a, J_0(q a) ≈ 1 - (q a)^2 /4.\n\nThe derivative of J_0(q r) at r = a is q J_0'(q a) ≈ q [ -J_1(q a) ] ≈ q [ - (q a)/2 ] = - q² a / 2, using the expansion for J_1(z) ≈ z/2 for small z.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side of the quantization condition:\n\nq J_1(q a)/J_0(q a) ≈ q * [ - (q a)/2 ] / [ 1 - (q a)^2 /4 ] ≈ - q² a / 2 * [1 + (q a)^2 /4 + ... ] ≈ - q² a / 2\n\nSince (q a)^2 is small, we can neglect higher-order terms.\n\nOn the right-hand side, we had approximately 1/(a [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ]). Therefore, equating both sides:\n\n- q² a / 2 ≈ 1/(a [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ])\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nq² a / 2 ≈ -1/(a [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ])\n\nBut q² = 2m(V_0 - E)/ħ² = 2m(V_0 + ħ² k²/(2m))/ħ² = (2m V_0)/ħ² + k². Let me denote this as q² = q_0² + k², where q_0² = 2m V_0 / ħ². If the potential is shallow and the binding energy is small, then q_0 is small, and k is small. However, the right-hand side is negative, but the left-hand side is positive? Wait, this suggests a problem. Because q² is positive, a is positive, so left-hand side is positive. The right-hand side is -1/(...). This suggests a contradiction. Maybe I made a sign error.\n\nWait, earlier, we had:\n\nq J_1(q a)/J_0(q a) = k K_1(k a)/K_0(k a)\n\nBut when I approximated the left-hand side, I had:\n\nq J_1(q a)/J_0(q a) ≈ - q² a / 2\n\nBut J_1(q a) ≈ q a / 2, so actually:\n\nq J_1(q a)/J_0(q a) ≈ q * (q a / 2) / [1 - (q a)^2 /4 ] ≈ q² a / 2\n\nBecause J_1(z) ≈ z/2 for small z, and J_0(z) ≈ 1. Therefore, positive. Then the right-hand side is k K_1(k a)/K_0(k a) ≈ 1/(a [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ]). Therefore, equating:\n\nq² a / 2 ≈ 1/(a [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ])\n\nTherefore:\n\nq² ≈ 2 / [ a² [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ] ]\n\nBut q² = q_0² + k² = (2m V_0 / ħ²) + k². Assuming that the potential is shallow, so V_0 is small, and the binding energy is small, so k is small. Therefore, if both terms are small, maybe q² ≈ q_0². Let's suppose that k² << q_0², so q² ≈ q_0². Then:\n\nq_0² ≈ 2 / [ a² [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ] ]\n\nBut q_0² = 2m V_0 / ħ², so:\n\nV_0 ≈ ħ² / (m a²) * 1 / [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ]\n\nThis relates the potential depth V_0 to the binding energy k. However, we need to find an expression for the energy levels E = - ħ² k² / (2m). To find k, we need to solve this transcendental equation. However, for a shallow potential, V_0 is small, which would require the denominator [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ] to be large, meaning that ln(2/(k a)) is large, which implies that k a is very small, i.e., k << 1/a. Therefore, we can approximate ln(2/(k a)) ≈ - ln(k a / 2) ≈ - ln(k a) - ln(1/2) = - ln(k a) + ln 2. But if k a is very small, then ln(k a) is a large negative number, so ln(2/(k a)) is a large positive number. Therefore, the denominator is large, which makes V_0 small, as expected.\n\nLet me denote x = k a. Since x is small, we can write:\n\nln(2/(k a)) + γ = ln(2/a) - ln k + γ ≈ ln(2/a) + γ - ln x\n\nBut since x is small, ln x is large negative. However, the exact expression is:\n\nV_0 ≈ ħ² / (m a²) * 1 / [ ln(2/(x)) + γ ]\n\nBut V_0 is given (it's the depth of the potential well), so we can solve for x:\n\nln(2/x) + γ ≈ ħ² / (m a² V_0 )\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nln(2/x) ≈ ħ² / (m a² V_0 ) - γ\n\nLet me define a constant C = ħ² / (m a² V_0 ) - γ\n\nThen:\n\nln(2/x) ≈ C => 2/x ≈ e^C => x ≈ 2 e^{-C}\n\nTherefore:\n\nk a ≈ 2 exp[ - ( ħ² / (m a² V_0 ) - γ ) ] = 2 exp( γ - ħ² / (m a² V_0 ) )\n\nTherefore, the binding energy is:\n\nE = - ħ² k² / (2m) ≈ - ħ² / (2m) * 4 a² exp( 2 γ - 2 ħ² / (m a² V_0 ) )\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. However, if we are considering a shallow potential, V_0 is small, so the term ħ² / (m a² V_0 ) is large and positive, making the exponent -2 ħ² / (m a² V_0 ) very negative, hence the exponential is negligible. Therefore, this suggests that k approaches zero, which is consistent with shallow potential. However, this seems to suggest that the binding energy is exponentially small in 1/V_0, which is characteristic of bound states in 2D for weak potentials.\n\nBut this is getting too specific. The problem asks for the related expression for energy levels. Given that the solution far from the well is the modified Bessel function K_m(kr), and the energy levels are determined by the matching condition, which leads to a transcendental equation. For a shallow potential, we can approximate this equation to find the energy levels.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact form of U(r), it's challenging to derive an exact expression. But since it's a shallow potential, maybe we can assume that there is only one bound state (the ground state) with m=0, and use the approximation I started earlier.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the 2D analog of the 3D scattering length. In 2D, the concept is more complex, but for a shallow potential, there might be a way to relate the binding energy to the potential parameters.\n\nAnother approach is to use the WKB approximation for bound states in 2D. However, WKB is usually for 1D problems, but maybe can be extended. Alternatively, consider the integral equation for the wavefunction.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, perhaps I should summarize the key points:\n\n- The solution far from the well is the modified Bessel function K_m(kr), decaying exponentially.\n\n- The energy levels are determined by matching this exterior solution with the interior solution, leading to a transcendental equation involving Bessel functions.\n\n- For a shallow potential, the binding energy is exponentially small, and the energy levels can be approximated by solving the simplified transcendental equation under the assumption of small k and q.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the \"related expression for energy levels,\" and given that it's a two-dimensional shallow potential, the energy levels for the ground state (m=0) can be approximated as:\n\nE ≈ - (ħ² / (2m)) (1/(a² ln²(1/(k a)))) \n\nBut this is too vague. Alternatively, referencing known results, in 2D, for a weak potential, the binding energy is given by:\n\nE ≈ - (m / (2π² ħ²)) (ln(π/(2 a² V_0)))^{-2}\n\nBut I need to verify.\n\nActually, in 2D, the bound state energy for a shallow potential can be approximated using the zero-range potential approach. The 2D Schrödinger equation for a zero-range potential (δ-function) has a bound state with energy determined by the renormalization of the coupling constant, but this is more advanced.\n\nAlternatively, consider the 2D square well potential with depth V_0 and radius a. The bound state condition for m=0 is:\n\nq J_1(q a)/J_0(q a) = -k K_1(k a)/K_0(k a)\n\nWait earlier I had a sign issue. Let me check again.\n\nThe quantization condition was:\n\nq J_1(q a)/J_0(q a) = k K_1(k a)/K_0(k a)\n\nBut earlier when approximating, I found that the left side was approximately q² a / 2 and the right side was approximately 1/(a [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ]). So equating them:\n\nq² a² / 2 ≈ 1 / [ ln(2/(k a)) + γ ]\n\nTherefore:\n\nln(2/(k a)) + γ ≈ 1/(q² a² / 2) = 2/(q² a²)\n\nBut q² = 2m(V_0 - E)/ħ². For shallow potential, let's assume that E is negligible compared to V_0, so q² ≈ 2m V_0 / ħ². Therefore:\n\nln(2/(k a)) + γ ≈ 2 / [ (2m V_0 / ħ²) a² ] = ħ² / (m V_0 a²)\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nln(2/(k a)) ≈ ħ² / (m V_0 a²) - γ\n\nExponentiating both sides:\n\n2/(k a) ≈ exp( ħ² / (m V_0 a²) - γ )\n\nTherefore:\n\nk ≈ 2 / [ a exp( ħ² / (m V_0 a²) - γ ) ]\n\nThen the binding energy is:\n\nE = - ħ² k² / (2m) ≈ - (4 ħ²) / (2m a²) exp( - 2 [ ħ² / (m V_0 a²) - γ ] )\n\nSimplifying:\n\nE ≈ - (2 ħ²) / (m a²) exp( - 2 ħ² / (m V_0 a²) + 2 γ )\n\nThis is an expression for the energy level in terms of the potential depth V_0, range a, mass m, and constants. Since the potential is shallow, V_0 is small, making the exponent -2 ħ² / (m V_0 a²) very negative, hence E is exponentially small, which makes sense for a shallow bound state in 2D.\n\nTherefore, the energy levels for a two-dimensional shallow potential well are exponentially small and given approximately by:\n\nE ≈ - C exp( - D / V_0 )\n\nWhere C and D are constants depending on m, a, and ħ. Specifically, from above:\n\nE ≈ - (2 ħ² / (m a²)) exp(2 γ) exp( - 2 ħ² / (m V_0 a²) )\n\nThis can be written as:\n\nE ≈ - K exp( - Λ / V_0 )\n\nWhere K and Λ are constants determined by the parameters of the system.\n\nHowever, this is a very rough approximation. The exact expression would require solving the transcendental equation numerically, but for a shallow potential, this exponential dependence is characteristic.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- The solution of the free motion equation (outside the well) is the modified Bessel function K_m(kr), which decays exponentially.\n\n- The energy levels are determined by matching this with the interior solution, leading to a transcendental equation. For a shallow potential, the energy levels are exponentially small and can be approximated by the expression derived above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the energy levels would involve an exponential dependence on the inverse of the potential depth, as shown.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy levels for a two-dimensional shallow potential well are approximately given by \\boxed{E \\propto -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{C}{V_0}\\right)}, where $ C $ is a constant depending on the system parameters.\n</think>"}
