The options are given as A to D. Let me start by recalling what I know about capacitors and energy storage.\n\nFirst, capacitors store electrical energy when they are charged. The amount of energy stored in a capacitor depends on its capacitance and the voltage to which it is charged. I remember there's a formula for the energy stored in a capacitor. Is it something like E equals one half C V squared? Let me think. Yeah, I think that's right. The formula is E = (1/2) C V². So the energy required to charge the capacitor should be equal to this value, right? Because the work done to charge it is essentially the energy stored in it.\n\nAlright, let me write that down. The capacitance C is 10 microfarads. Micro is 10^-6, so that's 10 × 10^-6 farads. The voltage V is 100 volts. Plugging these into the formula: E = 0.5 * 10 * 10^-6 F * (100 V)^2.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, calculate (100 V)^2. That's 10,000 V². Then multiply by 10 * 10^-6 F. So 10 * 10^-6 is 10^-5. Then 10^-5 F * 10,000 V². Let's see, 10^-5 times 10^4 is 10^-1, which is 0.1. Then multiply by 0.5, so 0.5 * 0.1 equals 0.05 joules. Wait, so the energy is 0.05 J? Let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again: E = 0.5 * C * V². C = 10 µF = 10 × 10^-6 F. V = 100 V. So:\n\nE = 0.5 * 10 × 10^-6 * (100)^2  \n= 0.5 * 10 × 10^-6 * 10,000  \n= 0.5 * 10 × 10^-6 * 10^4  \n= 0.5 * 10 × 10^(-6 + 4)  \n= 0.5 * 10 × 10^-2  \n= 0.5 * 10^-1  \n= 0.5 * 0.1  \n= 0.05 J.\n\nYes, that's 0.05 joules. So looking at the options given, option C is 0.05 J. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me just confirm that the formula is indeed E = ½ C V². Sometimes I might confuse it with other formulas related to capacitors, like charge Q = C V. But energy is different. Let me recall: when charging a capacitor, the work done is the integral of V dq, and since V = q/C, integrating from 0 to Q gives ½ Q²/C, which is equivalent to ½ C V². Yes, that's correct. So the energy stored is indeed ½ C V². Therefore, my calculation seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: if I use Q = C V, then Q = 10 × 10^-6 F * 100 V = 0.001 coulombs. Then energy is also ½ Q V, which would be 0.5 * 0.001 C * 100 V = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 J. Same result. So that confirms it again. So the answer is C: 0.05 J.\n\nHmm, but let me check if there's any trick in the question. The question says \"how much work is required to charge...\" So is there any other factor I need to consider? Like, maybe inefficiency or something? But in ideal cases, assuming no energy losses, the work done by the battery (or whatever source) would be QV, but the energy stored in the capacitor is ½ QV. Wait, so there's a discrepancy here. Where does that come from?\n\nAh, right. If you're charging a capacitor from a voltage source, the work done by the voltage source is actually QV, but half of that energy is lost as heat or other forms in the circuit (assuming an ideal resistor, for example). However, the question is asking for the work required to charge the capacitor, which is the energy stored in the capacitor, which is ½ C V². Unless the question is considering the total work done by the source, which would be QV = C V². But that's not the case here. The options don't have 0.1 J as the answer for the stored energy, but option D is 0.1 J. Wait, but according to the calculation, the stored energy is 0.05 J. So if the question is about the work required to charge it, meaning the energy stored, then it's 0.05 J. But if it's about the total work done by the EMF source, it would be 0.1 J. However, in physics problems, when they ask for the work required to charge a capacitor, they usually mean the energy stored in it, which is ½ C V². Therefore, answer C.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose you have a capacitor and you charge it up. The energy stored is ½ C V². The work done by whatever is charging it (like a battery) is actually more, because during the charging process, there's resistance in the circuit, and energy is lost there. But if we assume an ideal case with no resistance, then where does the other half go? In reality, you can't have zero resistance, but in theoretical terms, sometimes they consider ideal charging. However, in most textbook problems, unless specified otherwise, the energy stored in the capacitor is considered the work required, or maybe the question assumes that you are to calculate the energy stored. Since the options include both 0.05 J and 0.1 J, and given that the formula ½ C V² is standard for energy stored, I think the answer is C. Also, the options given are A:0.005, B:0.01, C:0.05, D:0.1. So 0.05 is C. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to check with numbers: Let's compute ½ * 10e-6 * 100^2.\n\nFirst, 100 squared is 10,000. Multiply by 10e-6: 10,000 * 10e-6 = 0.1. Then half of that is 0.05. Yep, same result. So definitely 0.05 J. So answer C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
