So, the question is about the equilibrium of the reaction where ethylene (CH₂=CH₂) reacts with water vapor (H₂O) to produce ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH). The reaction is taking place in a closed container at a certain temperature, and we need to determine which of the given statements (A to D) are correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Le Chatelier's principle, which states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the system will adjust itself to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium. Also, I should remember how changes in pressure, concentration, catalysts, and temperature affect equilibrium positions and constants.\n\nLet me start by writing down the balanced chemical equation. The reaction given is:\n\nCH₂=CH₂(g) + H₂O(g) ⇌ CH₃CH₂OH(g)\n\nSo, one mole of ethylene gas reacts with one mole of water vapor to produce one mole of ethanol gas. Let me check if the equation is balanced. On the left, we have 4 H from ethylene, 2 H from water, total 6 H; on the right, ethanol has 6 H. Carbon: 2 on left, 2 on right. Oxygen: 1 from water on left, 1 in ethanol on right. So yes, balanced as written. So stoichiometric coefficients are all 1.\n\nNow let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Increasing the pressure, v_forward > v_reverse, the equilibrium constant increases.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. Increasing the pressure. How does that affect the reaction? The number of moles of gas on each side. On the left side, there are 2 moles of gas (1 ethylene + 1 water). On the right side, 1 mole of ethanol. So total moles decrease from 2 to 1. If we increase the pressure, the system will shift to the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce pressure. That would be towards the products (right side). So the forward reaction rate would initially be greater than the reverse rate until new equilibrium is established. But what about the equilibrium constant? The equilibrium constant K depends only on temperature. Since the problem states \"at a certain temperature,\" changing pressure (assuming temperature is constant) does not change K. So the first part of the statement says the equilibrium constant increases, which is incorrect. Therefore, option A is wrong.\n\nOption B: Adding a catalyst increases the concentration of CH₃CH₂OH(g) at equilibrium.\n\nAdding a catalyst. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy for both the forward and reverse reactions, allowing the system to reach equilibrium faster. However, they do not affect the position of the equilibrium. The concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium remain the same; only the time taken to reach equilibrium is changed. Therefore, adding a catalyst does not increase the concentration of ethanol at equilibrium. So option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: At constant volume, adding a certain amount of H₂O(g), the equilibrium shifts towards the forward reaction.\n\nAdding more H₂O(g) (a reactant) should shift the equilibrium to the right (towards products) to consume some of the added H₂O. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle: increasing concentration of a reactant shifts the equilibrium towards the products. Therefore, the statement in option C is correct.\n\nOption D: At constant volume, adding a certain amount of CH₂=CH₂(g), the equilibrium conversion of CH₂=CH₂(g) increases.\n\nAdding more ethylene (a reactant) would shift the equilibrium towards the products (right) to consume some of the added ethylene. However, the question is about the equilibrium conversion of CH₂=CH₂. Conversion refers to the extent to which the reactant is converted into products. If you add more reactant, even though the reaction shifts to the right, the conversion (i.e., the fraction of the original ethylene that reacts) might actually decrease. Wait, let me think carefully.\n\nSuppose initially we have a certain amount of ethylene and water. Let's say the conversion is x. Now, if we add more ethylene, keeping the volume constant, the system will shift to the right to make more ethanol. However, the conversion of ethylene (the amount that reacts divided by the total amount present initially plus added) might be less than before. For example, imagine you have 1 mole of ethylene and add another 1 mole. The system will shift to the right, but the amount of ethanol produced may not be double. The conversion (amount reacted over total) could be lower. However, the question says \"the equilibrium conversion of CH₂=CH₂ increases.\" Wait, conversion here is a bit ambiguous. If conversion refers to the absolute amount that reacts, then adding more ethylene would lead to more reacting. But if it refers to the percentage or fraction of the ethylene that is converted, then adding more ethylene would decrease the conversion (since you're adding more, so even if some reacts, the fraction is less). \n\nBut the wording is \"the equilibrium conversion of CH₂=CH₂ increases.\" The term \"conversion\" in chemical engineering typically refers to the amount reacted relative to the initial amount. However, in this case, since we're adding more CH₂=CH₂, the initial amount is increased. Let me think with an example.\n\nLet me take hypothetical numbers. Suppose initially, without adding more ethylene, the equilibrium has 50% conversion. That is, if I start with 1 mole of ethylene, at equilibrium, 0.5 moles have reacted. Now, if I add more ethylene, say another 1 mole, making the initial ethylene 2 moles. The system will shift to the right. However, due to Le Chatelier's principle, the reaction will consume some of the added ethylene. Let's assume that at the new equilibrium, maybe 0.75 moles have reacted. The conversion now would be 0.75 / 2 = 37.5%, which is less than 50%. So the conversion (as a fraction) decreases. However, the absolute amount of ethylene that reacted increased from 0.5 to 0.75. But the question says \"the equilibrium conversion of CH₂=CH₂ increases.\" If \"conversion\" here refers to the absolute amount, then it increases. But in standard terminology, conversion is usually expressed as a percentage or fraction of the initial amount. \n\nBut the problem is in Chinese, and the translation might affect the interpretation. However, given that in most contexts, conversion refers to the fraction or percentage, adding more reactant would decrease the conversion. Therefore, the statement in option D would be incorrect. However, I need to be careful here. Let me check another way. Suppose the reaction quotient Q after adding more CH₂=CH₂. Initially, adding more CH₂=CH₂ increases the concentration of reactants, so Q = [ethanol]/([ethylene][water]). If we add ethylene, [ethylene] increases, so Q decreases. Since Q < K, the reaction will shift to the right to increase Q until it reaches K. So the system will produce more ethanol, consuming some ethylene. However, the conversion (as a fraction) may or may not increase. Let me take a concrete example with actual calculations.\n\nLet me assume the reaction is at equilibrium with certain concentrations. Let me assign some arbitrary values for simplicity. Suppose initially, [C2H4] = 1 M, [H2O] = 1 M, [C2H5OH] = 1 M. Let's say K is [C2H5OH]/([C2H4][H2O]) = 1/(1*1) = 1. Now, suppose we add 1 M more C2H4, making its concentration 2 M. The new Q is [1]/(2*1) = 0.5 < K (which is 1). Therefore, the reaction shifts forward. Let's say it shifts by x. New concentrations would be:\n\n[C2H4] = 2 - x\n\n[H2O] = 1 - x (assuming stoichiometry 1:1:1)\n\n[C2H5OH] = 1 + x\n\nSet Q = K: (1 + x)/[(2 - x)(1 - x)] = 1\n\nSo solving:\n\n1 + x = (2 - x)(1 - x)\n\nExpand RHS: 2*1 - 2x -x*1 + x² = 2 - 3x + x²\n\nSo equation:\n\n1 + x = 2 - 3x + x²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n1 + x - 2 + 3x - x² = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-1) + 4x - x² = 0 → -x² + 4x -1 = 0 → x² -4x +1 =0\n\nSolutions: x = [4 ± sqrt(16 -4)]/2 = [4 ± sqrt(12)]/2 = [4 ± 2*sqrt(3)]/2 = 2 ± sqrt(3). Since sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so x ≈ 2 + 1.732 ≈ 3.732 or 2 - 1.732 ≈ 0.268. Since concentrations can't be negative, take x ≈ 0.268.\n\nSo new concentrations:\n\n[C2H4] ≈ 2 - 0.268 ≈ 1.732 M\n\n[H2O] ≈ 1 - 0.268 ≈ 0.732 M\n\n[C2H5OH] ≈ 1 + 0.268 ≈ 1.268 M\n\nOriginal conversion was 1 mole reacted out of 1 mole, so 100%. Wait, no, in my initial assumption, the concentrations were 1 M each, but that's at equilibrium. Wait, actually, in my hypothetical example, I set initial concentrations at equilibrium. But when I added more C2H4, the system shifted. However, in reality, the initial conversion before adding was such that [C2H4] = 1 M, but if I had started with some initial amount, say, maybe 2 moles in a 2 L container? Wait, maybe my example is confusing because I set the initial concentrations to 1 M each at equilibrium. Let me try again with a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the reaction without catalysts and assume that initially, we have some amount of ethylene and water. Let me suppose that the system is at equilibrium with certain concentrations. Now, if we add more ethylene, the system will shift to the right, producing more ethanol. However, the conversion of ethylene (the fraction that reacts) depends on how much we added. \n\nSuppose initially, we have 1 mole of ethylene and 1 mole of water in a 1 L container. Let’s say at equilibrium, they react to form 0.5 moles of ethanol. So conversion of ethylene is 0.5/1 = 50%. Now, suppose we add another 1 mole of ethylene, making it 2 moles total. The system shifts to the right. Let’s assume that x moles of ethylene react. The new equilibrium concentrations would be:\n\n[C2H4] = 2 - x\n\n[H2O] = 1 - x\n\n[ethanol] = 0.5 + x\n\nAssuming the volume is still 1 L, so concentrations are same as moles. The equilibrium constant K is [ethanol]/([C2H4][H2O]) = (0.5 + x)/[(2 - x)(1 - x)].\n\nOriginally, K was (0.5)/[(1)(1)] = 0.5. So after adding ethylene, we have:\n\n(0.5 + x)/[(2 - x)(1 - x)] = 0.5\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\n0.5 + x = 0.5*(2 - x)(1 - x)\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\n0.5*(2*1 - 2x - x*1 + x²) = 0.5*(2 - 3x + x²) = 1 - 1.5x + 0.5x²\n\nLeft side: 0.5 + x\n\nEquation:\n\n0.5 + x = 1 - 1.5x + 0.5x²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n0.5 + x -1 + 1.5x - 0.5x² = 0 → -0.5 + 2.5x - 0.5x² = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -2 to eliminate decimals:\n\n1 - 5x + x² = 0 → x² -5x +1 =0\n\nSolutions:\n\nx = [5 ± sqrt(25 -4)]/2 = [5 ± sqrt(21)]/2 ≈ [5 ± 4.583]/2\n\nSo positive root: (5 + 4.583)/2 ≈ 9.583/2 ≈ 4.79, which is more than the initial moles, impossible. The other root: (5 - 4.583)/2 ≈ 0.417/2 ≈ 0.2085.\n\nSo x ≈ 0.2085 moles reacted.\n\nTherefore, the new conversion of ethylene is 0.2085 / 2 ≈ 10.4%, which is much less than the original 50%. However, the absolute amount of ethylene that reacted increased from 0.5 moles to 0.2085 moles? Wait, no, 0.2085 is less than 0.5. Wait, that contradicts the expectation. Wait, initially, with 1 mole ethylene, 0.5 moles reacted. Now with 2 moles ethylene, adding it and shifting, only 0.2085 moles reacted? That seems counterintuitive. Wait, perhaps my initial assumption of K was wrong? Wait in my first scenario, I assumed that K was 0.5. Let me check.\n\nOriginal K was [ethanol]/([C2H4][H2O]) = 0.5 / (1 * 1) = 0.5. After adding ethylene, we set up the equation with the same K. However, when I solved, the amount of ethanol increased from 0.5 to 0.5 + 0.2085 ≈ 0.7085. But according to the calculation, the new ethanol concentration is 0.7085, and the new ethylene is 2 - 0.2085 ≈ 1.7915, and water is 1 - 0.2085 ≈ 0.7915. Let's check K:\n\n[ethanol]/([C2H4][H2O]) = 0.7085 / (1.7915 * 0.7915) ≈ 0.7085 / (1.417) ≈ 0.5, which matches K. So the calculation is correct.\n\nBut the amount of ethanol increased from 0.5 to ~0.7085, which is more. However, the conversion of ethylene decreased from 50% to ~10.4%. Therefore, the statement in option D says \"the equilibrium conversion of CH₂=CH₂ increases,\" which in this case it does not. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The original conversion was 50% because 0.5 moles reacted out of 1 mole. After adding more ethylene, even though the amount reacted is less (0.2085 vs 0.5), the question is about the conversion. If conversion is defined as the amount reacted divided by the amount initially present (which in this case, after adding, is 2 moles), then 0.2085 / 2 ≈ 10.4% conversion, which is lower. Therefore, the statement in D is incorrect. So option D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, among the options, only option C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The question says \"the equilibrium conversion of CH₂=CH₂ increases.\" If conversion is defined as the extent of reaction relative to the amount added, but in standard terms, conversion is usually the fraction reacted. So adding more reactant would decrease the conversion. Therefore, option D is incorrect. So the correct answer is C.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Maybe there's a different interpretation. For example, if the question is referring to the conversion of the added ethylene, not the total. But that's not standard. Typically, conversion is based on the initial amount of the reactant. Since we added more ethylene, the total initial amount is higher, so even if more reacts in absolute terms, the fraction is less. Therefore, the statement in D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are (A)-(D), and the question says \"the following statements are correct.\" So the answer should be C. Let me confirm once more.\n\nOption C: At constant volume, adding H2O(g), equilibrium shifts forward. Yes, because adding a reactant shifts towards products.\n\nOption D: Adding more ethylene, conversion of ethylene increases. As shown in the example, conversion decreases. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other possibility. For example, if the reaction is exothermic or endothermic? But the problem doesn't mention temperature changes when pressure is increased or when concentrations are changed. The question is about changes in pressure, catalyst, adding H2O, or adding ethylene. Since temperature is constant (as stated in the problem), the equilibrium constant doesn't change, and we don't need to consider enthalpy here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
