The sphere has radius a and polarization intensity P. Let me start by recalling what polarization means. Polarization P is the dipole moment per unit volume. Since the sphere is uniformly polarized, the dipoles are all aligned the same way, right? \n\nNow, I remember that when you have a polarized object, it can be thought of as having bound charges. The bound volume charge density is given by -∇·P, and the bound surface charge density is P·n̂, where n̂ is the outward normal vector. Since the polarization is uniform, the divergence of P is zero, so there are no bound volume charges. That means all the bound charge is on the surface. \n\nSo the surface charge density σ_b = P · n̂. For a sphere, the normal vector at any point on the surface is just the radial direction. If the polarization is uniform, say in some direction, let's assume for simplicity that P is along the z-axis. Then, at any point on the sphere's surface, the normal vector is radial. But the polarization vector P is along the z-axis. Therefore, the dot product P · n̂ would depend on the angle between the radial direction and the z-axis. \n\nWait, in spherical coordinates, the radial direction is along the position vector of the point. So if the sphere is centered at the origin, then at a point on the sphere's surface, the normal vector is along the radial direction. So if P is along z, then σ_b = P · n̂ = P cosθ, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. That makes sense. So the surface charge density varies as cosθ. \n\nTherefore, the sphere has a surface charge density σ_b = P cosθ. Now, to find the electric field outside the sphere, I need to calculate the electric field produced by this surface charge distribution. \n\nHmm. How do I find the electric field from a surface charge distribution? Well, in general, you can use Coulomb's law, integrating over the surface, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use Gauss's law? But Gauss's law is useful when there's symmetry. Since the charge distribution is σ = P cosθ, which is similar to a dipole charge distribution. \n\nWait, a dipole has charges +q and -q separated by a small distance. The potential due to a dipole falls off as 1/r², and the electric field as 1/r³. But here, we have a sphere with a surface charge that's equivalent to a dipole. Maybe the sphere can be treated as a dipole? \n\nLet me think. The total dipole moment of the sphere. Since it's uniformly polarized, the total dipole moment is P multiplied by the volume of the sphere. Wait, polarization P is dipole moment per unit volume, so total dipole moment p = P * V = P * (4/3 π a³). \n\nBut how does this relate to the surface charge? If I have a surface charge σ = P cosθ, then the total dipole moment can be calculated by integrating r σ dA over the surface. Let me check that. \n\nThe dipole moment p is given by ∫ r' σ(r') dA', where r' is the position vector of the charge element. So integrating over the sphere's surface. Let me set up coordinates. Let’s take the sphere of radius a, centered at the origin. Let’s use spherical coordinates. The position vector of a point on the sphere is r' = a ř, where ř is the unit vector in the radial direction. \n\nBut σ = P cosθ. So p = ∫ σ r' dA = ∫ (P cosθ)(a ř) (a² sinθ dθ dφ). \n\nLet me compute this integral. \n\nFirst, note that ř depends on θ and φ. However, due to the symmetry, we can consider that the dipole moment will be along the z-axis since σ depends on cosθ, which is symmetric around the z-axis. \n\nTherefore, we can compute the z-component of p. \n\nThe z-component of ř is cosθ. Therefore, the integrand becomes P cosθ * a * cosθ * a² sinθ dθ dφ. \n\nSo p_z = P a³ ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ dφ over φ from 0 to 2π and θ from 0 to π. \n\nLet me compute the integral. \n\nFirst integrate over φ: ∫₀²π dφ = 2π. \n\nThen the integral over θ: ∫₀^π cos²θ sinθ dθ. Let me make substitution u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ. Then when θ=0, u=1; θ=π, u=-1. The integral becomes ∫₁^{-1} u² (-du) = ∫_{-1}^1 u² du = [u³/3]_{-1}^1 = (1/3 - (-1)/3) = 2/3. \n\nTherefore, p_z = P a³ * 2π * (2/3) = P a³ * (4π/3). \n\nBut the total dipole moment is also p = P * (4/3 π a³). So that matches! So the total dipole moment of the sphere is indeed p = (4π/3) a³ P, which is consistent. \n\nTherefore, the surface charge distribution σ = P cosθ is equivalent to a dipole with dipole moment p = (4π/3)a³ P. \n\nTherefore, outside the sphere, the electric field should be the same as that of a dipole. \n\nThe electric field of a dipole is given by:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀)] [ (3(p·r̂)r̂ - p)/r³ + (p/3ε₀) δ³(r) ) ]\n\nBut since we are looking for the field outside the sphere, the delta function term doesn't contribute. Therefore, the electric field outside is:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀)] [ 3(p·r̂)r̂ - p ] / r³ \n\nSince the dipole moment p is along the z-axis, let me express this in coordinates. Let's assume that the dipole is along the z-axis. Then, in spherical coordinates, the electric field of a dipole is:\n\nE(r) = [p/(4πε₀ r³)] [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ]\n\nBut let me check the exact formula. Alternatively, if p is along z, then p·r̂ = p cosθ. Therefore:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³)] [ 3(p cosθ) r̂ - p ] \n\nBut we need to express this in terms of vectors. Let me recall that in spherical coordinates, the dipole field is:\n\nE = (p/(4πε₀ r³)) [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ]\n\nBut another expression is:\n\nE = [p/(4πε₀ r³)] [ (3 cos²θ - 1) r̂ + 3 cosθ sinθ θ̂ ] \n\nWait, maybe I need to derive it again. Let me recall that for a dipole oriented along z-axis, the potential is:\n\nφ(r) = [p cosθ]/(4πε₀ r²)\n\nThen, the electric field is the negative gradient of the potential. Let me compute that. \n\nIn spherical coordinates, the gradient of φ is:\n\n∇φ = ∂φ/∂r r̂ + (1/r) ∂φ/∂θ θ̂ \n\nSo compute ∂φ/∂r:\n\n∂φ/∂r = [ -2 p cosθ ] / (4πε₀ r³ )\n\nAnd ∂φ/∂θ:\n\n∂φ/∂θ = [ -p sinθ ] / (4πε₀ r² )\n\nTherefore,\n\n∇φ = [ -2 p cosθ / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] r̂ + [ -p sinθ / (4πε₀ r² ) ] * (1/r) θ̂ \n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ -2 p cosθ / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] r̂ - [ p sinθ / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] θ̂ \n\nTherefore, the electric field is E = -∇φ:\n\nE = [ 2 p cosθ / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] r̂ + [ p sinθ / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] θ̂ \n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nE = [ p / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ]\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's written in terms of vectors. Let me recall that in vector form, the electric field of a dipole is:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀)] [ (3(p·r̂)r̂ - p)/r³ ]\n\nBut let me check this. Let me take r along the z-axis. Then r̂ = ẑ, and p = p ẑ. Then,\n\n(3(p·r̂)r̂ - p)/r³ = [3p - p]/r³ = 2p / r³. Which would give E = 2p/(4πε₀ r³) ẑ. But according to the previous expression, when θ = 0, cosθ = 1, sinθ = 0, so E = [2p/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] r̂. Which matches. However, if we use the formula from the vector expression, it would be [3(p·r̂)r̂ - p]/(4πε₀ r³). Wait, there is a discrepancy here. Wait, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me check. Let me take the dipole field formula. From Griffiths' Introduction to Electrodynamics, equation 4.5:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀)] [ (3(p·r̂)r̂ - p)/r³ ] - [p/(3ε₀)] δ³(r)\n\nSo that's the electric field. So if we are outside the dipole, the electric field is [1/(4πε₀)] [ (3(p·r̂)r̂ - p)/r³ ]\n\nBut when I calculated from the potential, I found E = [ p / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ]\n\nLet me check if these are equivalent. Let me write the vector formula in spherical coordinates. Let me suppose p is along z-axis. Then p = p ẑ. Let me express (3(p·r̂)r̂ - p)/r³. \n\nFirst, p·r̂ = p cosθ. Therefore:\n\n3(p·r̂)r̂ - p = 3p cosθ r̂ - p ẑ \n\nBut ẑ can be expressed in terms of spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, ẑ = cosθ r̂ - sinθ θ̂. Wait, no. Wait, unit vectors in spherical coordinates:\n\nr̂ = sinθ cosφ x̂ + sinθ sinφ ŷ + cosθ ẑ \n\nθ̂ = cosθ cosφ x̂ + cosθ sinφ ŷ - sinθ ẑ \n\nφ̂ = -sinφ x̂ + cosφ ŷ \n\nTherefore, ẑ = cosθ r̂ - sinθ θ̂. \n\nTherefore, substituting back into 3p cosθ r̂ - p ẑ:\n\n= 3p cosθ r̂ - p (cosθ r̂ - sinθ θ̂ )\n\n= 3p cosθ r̂ - p cosθ r̂ + p sinθ θ̂ \n\n= 2p cosθ r̂ + p sinθ θ̂ \n\nTherefore, the vector formula gives:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2p cosθ r̂ + p sinθ θ̂ ] \n\nWhich matches exactly with what I derived from the potential! So that's good. Therefore, the electric field outside the sphere is the same as that of a dipole with dipole moment p = (4π/3) a³ P. \n\nTherefore, substituting p into the expression:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2p cosθ r̂ + p sinθ θ̂ ] \n\n= [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2*(4π/3 a³ P) cosθ r̂ + (4π/3 a³ P) sinθ θ̂ ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (4π/3 a³ P) / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ]\n\nThe 4π cancels:\n\n= [ (a³ P) / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ]\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write this in terms of the original polarization P. \n\nBut maybe we can express this in a more compact form. Let me recall that the dipole moment of the sphere is p = (4π/3)a³ P. Therefore, substituting back into the general dipole formula:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3(p·r̂)r̂ - p ]\n\nWhich, with p = (4π/3)a³ P, gives:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3((4π/3)a³ P · r̂ )r̂ - (4π/3)a³ P ]\n\n= [ (4π/3)a³ / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3(P · r̂ )r̂ - P ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3(P · r̂ )r̂ - P ]\n\n= [ a³ / ( ε₀ r³ ) ] [ (P · r̂ )r̂ - (1/3) P ]\n\nTherefore, the electric field outside the sphere is proportional to [ (P · r̂ )r̂ - (1/3) P ] divided by ε₀ r³ multiplied by a³. \n\nBut maybe there is another way to express this. Alternatively, if we want to write it in terms of vectors, perhaps we can use tensor notation or something, but maybe it's fine as it is. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it in terms of unit vectors. Let me consider that for points outside the sphere, the position vector r is from the center of the sphere. Since the polarization is uniform, the result depends on the direction of P. \n\nBut the problem says \"Find the electric field outside the dielectric sphere.\" Since the sphere is uniformly polarized, but the direction of P is not specified. However, since the problem is general, we can assume that P is along some axis, say z-axis, and express the answer in terms of P and the position vector. \n\nAlternatively, the answer can be written in terms of the dipole moment. However, since the problem gives P and the radius a, it's better to express in terms of those. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the electric field outside the sphere is:\n\nE(r) = [ (P a³) / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ] \n\nOr, using the dipole formula:\n\nE(r) = [ P a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · r̂ ) r̂ - P ] / |P|² ? Wait no. Wait, no, the dipole moment p is proportional to P. Wait, p = (4π/3)a³ P. Therefore, if we write E(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3(p·r̂)r̂ - p ] \n\nBut substituting p = (4π/3)a³ P:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3*( (4π/3)a³ P · r̂ ) r̂ - (4π/3)a³ P ]\n\n= [ (4π/3)a³ / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · r̂ ) r̂ - P ]\n\n= [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · r̂ ) r̂ - P ]\n\nTherefore, E(r) = [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · r̂ ) r̂ - P ]\n\nThis seems like a compact vector expression. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to write in terms of the position vector r. Let me note that r̂ = r / r, so:\n\nE(r) = [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · (r / r)) (r / r) - P ]\n\n= [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · r) r / r² - P ]\n\n= [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · r) r / r² - P ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · r) r / r² - P ]\n\n= [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3 (P · r) r / r² ] - [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] P \n\n= [ a³ (P · r) r / (ε₀ r^5 ) ] - [ a³ P / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ]\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. The key point is that outside the sphere, the electric field is the same as that of a dipole with dipole moment p = (4π/3)a³ P. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem asks for the electric field outside the sphere, and we have found that it's equivalent to a dipole field, maybe we can just state the answer in terms of dipole field. \n\nBut let me check if there is another approach to derive this, just to confirm. \n\nAnother approach is to use the method of solving for the potential outside the sphere due to the surface charge σ = P cosθ. \n\nThe potential outside the sphere can be found by solving Laplace's equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Since there is no free charge outside, the potential satisfies Laplace's equation. Given the symmetry of the problem (azimuthal symmetry because σ depends only on θ), we can expand the potential in terms of Legendre polynomials. \n\nThe general solution for the potential outside a sphere (r ≥ a) is:\n\nφ(r, θ) = Σ [ A_l r^{-(l+1)} ] P_l (cosθ)\n\nWhere A_l are coefficients determined by the boundary conditions at r = a. \n\nThe surface charge is σ = P cosθ. The potential just outside the sphere (at r = a+) is related to the potential inside. However, since there is no free charge inside, and assuming the sphere is in a vacuum (or the problem doesn't specify other materials), the potential inside would have a different expansion, but since we are only interested in the outside, let's focus on that. \n\nThe potential outside must satisfy the boundary condition related to the surface charge. The discontinuity in the electric field across a surface charge σ is given by:\n\nE_out - E_in = σ / ε₀ n̂ \n\nBut since inside the sphere, for r < a, there is no free charge, but there is bound charge. However, since we are only interested in the potential outside, maybe we can use the surface charge to find the coefficients A_l. \n\nAlternatively, since we know that σ = P cosθ, which is proportional to P_1(cosθ), we can use the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials. \n\nThe surface charge σ(θ) = P cosθ = P P_1(cosθ). \n\nThe potential outside is φ(r, θ) = Σ [ A_l r^{-(l+1)} ] P_l (cosθ). \n\nAt r = a, the potential must satisfy the boundary condition related to the surface charge. However, the relation between the potential and the surface charge can be found through the electric field. \n\nThe electric field is -∇φ. The discontinuity in the electric field across the surface is σ / ε₀. Therefore, the radial component of the electric field just outside the sphere minus the radial component just inside is σ / ε₀. \n\nAssuming that inside the sphere, for r < a, the potential is φ_in(r, θ). But since we don't need the inside potential, maybe we can use the fact that the surface charge induces the potential outside. \n\nAlternatively, since σ(θ) is known, we can use the formula for the potential due to a surface charge distribution:\n\nφ(r) = [1/(4πε₀)] ∫ [ σ(θ') / |r - r'| ] dA'\n\nBut integrating this directly might be complicated. However, since σ is proportional to P_1(cosθ'), we can use the expansion of 1/|r - r'| in terms of Legendre polynomials. \n\nFor points outside the sphere (r ≥ a), we can expand:\n\n1/|r - r'| = Σ [ (a^{l} / r^{l+1}) ] P_l (cosα)\n\nWhere α is the angle between r and r'. However, using the addition theorem, we can relate this to the Legendre polynomials in the coordinate system of the sphere. \n\nAlternatively, since σ(θ') = P P_1(cosθ'), and we are looking for φ(r, θ) outside, which should only have an l=1 term because σ is proportional to P_1. \n\nTherefore, φ(r, θ) = A_1 r^{-2} P_1(cosθ). \n\nTo find A_1, we can use the boundary condition at r = a. The potential must satisfy the relation involving the surface charge. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the potential due to a surface charge distribution. Since σ is proportional to P_1, the integral will pick out the l=1 term. \n\nLet me recall that for a surface charge σ(θ') on a sphere of radius a, the potential outside is:\n\nφ(r, θ) = [ (a / ε₀ ) / (2l + 1) ] [ ∫ σ(θ') P_l (cosθ') dΩ' ] r^{-(l+1)} P_l (cosθ)\n\nWait, more carefully, the coefficients A_l can be found by:\n\nA_l = [ (l + 1/2) ε₀ a^{l} ]^{-1} ∫ σ(θ') P_l (cosθ') dΩ'\n\nBut I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nAlternatively, since we know that for a potential outside a sphere, φ(r, θ) = Σ [ A_l r^{-(l+1)} ] P_l (cosθ), and the surface charge σ(θ) is related to the discontinuity in the electric field. \n\nThe electric field just outside the sphere is -dφ/dr |_{r=a} r̂ - (1/r) ∂φ/∂θ |_{r=a} θ̂ \n\nBut the radial component of the electric field just outside minus the radial component just inside equals σ / ε₀. Assuming that inside the sphere, for r < a, there is some potential φ_in(r, θ). However, since we don't have information about the inside, maybe we can assume that the potential inside is such that it satisfies the necessary conditions. However, since we only need the outside potential, and knowing that σ is proportional to P_1, we can assume that only l=1 term contributes. \n\nTherefore, let me assume φ(r, θ) = A r^{-2} P_1(cosθ) = - A r^{-2} cosθ (since P_1(x) = x). Wait, P_1(cosθ) = cosθ. \n\nTherefore, φ(r, θ) = A r^{-2} cosθ. \n\nNow, the electric field outside is E = -∇φ. Let's compute it. \n\nIn spherical coordinates, the gradient of φ is:\n\n∇φ = ∂φ/∂r r̂ + (1/r) ∂φ/∂θ θ̂ \n\nCompute ∂φ/∂r:\n\n∂φ/∂r = -2 A r^{-3} cosθ \n\nCompute ∂φ/∂θ:\n\n∂φ/∂θ = -A r^{-2} sinθ \n\nTherefore,\n\n∇φ = -2 A r^{-3} cosθ r̂ - A r^{-3} sinθ θ̂ \n\nTherefore, E = -∇φ = 2 A r^{-3} cosθ r̂ + A r^{-3} sinθ θ̂ \n\nNow, the radial component of E just outside the sphere (at r = a+) is E_r = 2A a^{-3} cosθ. \n\nThe radial component of E just inside the sphere (at r = a-) would be due to the electric field inside the sphere. However, without knowing the inside field, maybe we can use the boundary condition:\n\nE_out · n̂ - E_in · n̂ = σ / ε₀ \n\nAssuming that E_in · n̂ is something, but since we don't know E_in, maybe we need another condition. However, if we consider that the potential must be continuous across the surface? Wait, no, the potential is continuous across the surface, but the electric field has a discontinuity. \n\nAlternatively, since there is no free charge, and the sphere is a dielectric, but we already accounted for the bound charges. However, since we are dealing with the electrostatic potential due to the bound charges, maybe we can use the relation between the surface charge and the potential. \n\nAlternatively, let me use the formula for the potential due to a surface charge. For a sphere, if σ(θ) = P cosθ, then the potential outside is that of a dipole, as we found earlier. But let me try to find A. \n\nThe potential due to a dipole is φ = [p cosθ]/(4πε₀ r²). Comparing this with our expression φ(r, θ) = A r^{-2} cosθ, we have A = p/(4πε₀). \n\nBut we found earlier that p = (4π/3)a³ P. Therefore, A = (4π/3 a³ P ) / (4πε₀) ) = a³ P / (3 ε₀ ). \n\nTherefore, φ(r, θ) = [ a³ P / (3 ε₀ ) ] * cosθ / r² \n\nTherefore, the electric field is:\n\nE = 2 A r^{-3} cosθ r̂ + A r^{-3} sinθ θ̂ \n\nSubstituting A:\n\nE = 2 [ a³ P / (3 ε₀ ) ] cosθ / r³ r̂ + [ a³ P / (3 ε₀ ) ] sinθ / r³ θ̂ \n\nWhich is:\n\nE = [ a³ P / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ]\n\nWhich matches our previous result. Therefore, this confirms that the electric field outside is indeed that of a dipole with dipole moment p = (4π/3)a³ P. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the electric field outside the sphere is the same as that of a dipole with dipole moment p = (4π/3)a³ P. \n\nBut the problem says \"Find the electric field outside the dielectric sphere.\" So they probably expect an expression in terms of P, a, r, θ, etc. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it in vector form. Since the dipole moment p is along the direction of P, which is uniform throughout the sphere. Let me denote the polarization vector as P (a vector). Then the dipole moment is p = (4π/3)a³ P. Therefore, substituting into the general dipole field formula:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3(p·r̂)r̂ - p ]\n\nSubstituting p:\n\nE(r) = [1/(4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3( (4π/3)a³ P · r̂ ) r̂ - (4π/3)a³ P ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (4π/3)a³ / (4πε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3(P · r̂)r̂ - P ]\n\n= [ a³ / (3 ε₀ r³ ) ] [ 3(P · r̂)r̂ - P ]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nE(r) = \\frac{a^3}{3 \\varepsilon_0 r^3} \\left[ 3 (\\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} - \\mathbf{P} \\right]\n\nThis is a compact vector expression for the electric field outside the sphere. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to express this in terms of the position vector r, noting that r̂ = r / r, then:\n\nE(r) = \\frac{a^3}{3 \\varepsilon_0 r^3} \\left[ 3 (\\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{r}) \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{r} - \\mathbf{P} \\right] = \\frac{a^3}{3 \\varepsilon_0 r^5} \\left[ 3 (\\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\mathbf{r} - r^2 \\mathbf{P} \\right]\n\nWhich is another way to write it. \n\nTherefore, this is the electric field outside the uniformly polarized dielectric sphere. \n\nTo recap, since the sphere is uniformly polarized, the bound charges are only on the surface with σ = P cosθ. This surface charge distribution is equivalent to a dipole with dipole moment p = (4π/3)a³ P. The electric field outside the sphere is then the same as that of a dipole with this dipole moment. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is the electric field given by the dipole formula with p = (4π/3)a³ P. \n\nLet me check for units. The units of electric field should be N/C or V/m. Let's check:\n\nP has units of C/m². a³ has units of m³. So a³ P has units of C·m. Which is the unit of dipole moment (C·m). Then, [a³ P]/[ε₀ r³] has units of [C·m]/[C²/(N·m²) * m³] = [C·m * N·m² / (C² * m³)] = [N / C]. Which matches the unit of electric field. \n\nYes, so the units are consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think this is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe electric field outside the dielectric sphere is \\boxed{\\dfrac{a^3}{3 \\varepsilon_0 r^3} \\left[ 3 (\\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} - \\mathbf{P} \\right]}.\n</think>"}
