The options are Gamma rays, Ultraviolet, Blue light, and Orange light. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the electromagnetic spectrum is ordered by wavelength, from longest to shortest, or maybe by frequency? Wait, wavelength and frequency are inversely related. So the longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency, and vice versa. \n\nFirst, let me recall the order of the electromagnetic spectrum. Starting from the longest wavelength (lowest frequency) to the shortest (highest frequency), it's: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Wait, visible light is in the middle. So within visible light, there are different colors. The colors go from red to violet, with red having the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum and violet the shortest. So red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. So orange light would have a longer wavelength than blue light. \n\nSo the options here are Gamma rays, Ultraviolet, Blue light, and Orange light. Let's place them in order. Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength among all, so they are at the high-frequency end. Then ultraviolet is just beyond visible light, right? So ultraviolet has shorter wavelengths than visible light. Wait, no. Wait, ultraviolet is higher frequency than visible light, so shorter wavelength. So visible light has longer wavelengths than ultraviolet. So ultraviolet is higher energy than visible light. \n\nSo if ultraviolet is shorter than visible light, then among the options, Gamma rays are shortest, then ultraviolet, then visible light. Within visible light, orange has longer wavelength than blue. So the order from longest to shortest wavelength would be: Orange light, Blue light, Ultraviolet, Gamma rays. Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. \n\nGamma rays: shortest wavelength. Ultraviolet is higher frequency than visible light, so shorter wavelength than visible. So visible light (orange and blue) have longer wavelengths than ultraviolet. So between orange and blue in visible light, orange has longer wavelength. Therefore, the order from longest to shortest is: Orange light, Blue light, Ultraviolet, Gamma rays. So the longest wavelength is Orange light. Therefore, the answer is D: Orange light. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me verify. Gamma rays are high energy, short wavelength. Ultraviolet is beyond violet, so shorter than violet (which is the shortest in visible). So ultraviolet is shorter than visible. So visible light includes orange and blue. Orange is on the longer wavelength end of visible, blue is shorter. So yes, orange has longer wavelength than blue. Therefore, among all the options given, D: Orange light has the longest wavelength. \n\nAnother way to think about it: the question is asking for the longest wavelength. So among the four options, which one is the farthest to the left on the electromagnetic spectrum. Starting from radio waves (longest), then microwaves, infrared, visible (which includes red/orange to violet), ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays. So Gamma rays are shortest. Ultraviolet is between visible and X-rays. So visible light is longer than ultraviolet. Within visible light, orange is longer than blue. Therefore, the order from longest to shortest is: Orange, Blue, Ultraviolet, Gamma. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
