Let me start by recalling what the problem says. There's a finite set S of distinct real numbers. When you add the number 1 to S, the mean becomes 13 less than the original mean of S. On the other hand, if you add 2001 to S instead, the mean becomes 27 more than the original mean. I need to figure out what the original mean of S is.\n\nLet me denote some variables. Let me call the original mean of S as m. Let me also let n be the number of elements in S. Since S is a finite set, n is some positive integer. Also, since all elements are distinct, adding 1 or 2001 might affect the mean depending on their values.\n\nFirst, the mean of S is m, so the sum of all elements in S is n*m. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, when we add 1 to S, the new set is S union {1}. Since all elements in S are distinct, adding 1 would add a new element only if 1 isn't already in S. But the problem says S has distinct real numbers, but doesn't specify that 1 or 2001 aren't in S. Wait, but if 1 was already in S, then adding it again would make duplicates, but the problem says S is a set, so duplicates aren't allowed. Therefore, adding 1 to S must be adding a new element not already in S. Similarly for 2001. Therefore, when we take S union {1}, it has n + 1 elements. Similarly for S union {2001}.\n\nTherefore, the mean of S union {1} is (sum of S + 1)/(n + 1). According to the problem, this is 13 less than the original mean m. So:\n\n(sum of S + 1)/(n + 1) = m - 13.\n\nSimilarly, for adding 2001:\n\n(sum of S + 2001)/(n + 1) = m + 27.\n\nBut since the sum of S is n*m, we can substitute that in both equations. Let me do that.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(n*m + 1)/(n + 1) = m - 13.\n\nSecond equation:\n\n(n*m + 2001)/(n + 1) = m + 27.\n\nSo now we have two equations with two variables: m and n. Our goal is to find m.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\n1) (n*m + 1)/(n + 1) = m - 13.\n\n2) (n*m + 2001)/(n + 1) = m + 27.\n\nSo maybe I can solve these equations for m and n.\n\nLet me start with equation 1. Multiply both sides by (n + 1):\n\nn*m + 1 = (m - 13)(n + 1).\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n(m - 13)(n + 1) = m*n + m - 13n - 13.\n\nTherefore, equation 1 becomes:\n\nn*m + 1 = m*n + m - 13n - 13.\n\nSubtract n*m from both sides:\n\n1 = m - 13n - 13.\n\nRearranging:\n\nm - 13n - 13 = 1 => m - 13n = 14 => m = 13n + 14. Let me note that as equation (a).\n\nNow let's do the same for equation 2:\n\nMultiply both sides by (n + 1):\n\nn*m + 2001 = (m + 27)(n + 1).\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n(m + 27)(n + 1) = m*n + m + 27n + 27.\n\nTherefore, equation 2 becomes:\n\nn*m + 2001 = m*n + m + 27n + 27.\n\nSubtract n*m from both sides:\n\n2001 = m + 27n + 27.\n\nRearranging:\n\nm + 27n + 27 = 2001 => m + 27n = 2001 - 27 => m + 27n = 1974. Let me note that as equation (b).\n\nNow, from equation (a): m = 13n + 14. Substitute this into equation (b):\n\n(13n + 14) + 27n = 1974.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(13n + 27n) + 14 = 1974 => 40n + 14 = 1974.\n\nSubtract 14 from both sides:\n\n40n = 1974 - 14 = 1960.\n\nTherefore, n = 1960 / 40 = 49.\n\nSo n is 49. Then m is 13n + 14 = 13*49 + 14. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 13*49: Let me compute 10*49=490, 3*49=147, so total is 490 + 147 = 637. Then add 14: 637 + 14 = 651. Therefore, m = 651.\n\nWait, so the mean of S is 651? Let me check if this works with equation (b). Let's check equation (b): m + 27n = 651 + 27*49.\n\nCompute 27*49. Let me do 27*50 = 1350, subtract 27: 1350 - 27 = 1323. Then 651 + 1323 = 1974. Which matches the right-hand side of equation (b). So that's correct.\n\nLet me also check equation (a): m = 13n +14. 13*49 is 637, plus 14 is 651, which matches. Also, let me check equation 1:\n\nOriginal mean m = 651, sum of S is n*m = 49*651. Let me compute that later if needed, but let's check the first condition.\n\nMean of S union {1} is (sum + 1)/(n + 1) = (49*651 + 1)/50. According to the problem, this should equal m -13 = 651 -13 = 638.\n\nLet me compute 49*651 + 1. Let me note that 49*651 = (50 - 1)*651 = 50*651 - 651 = 32550 - 651. Let me compute 32550 - 651: 32550 - 600 = 31950, then subtract 51 more: 31950 - 51 = 31899. Then add 1: 31899 + 1 = 31900. Therefore, the mean is 31900 / 50 = 638. Which is indeed 651 - 13. Perfect.\n\nSimilarly, check equation 2: (sum + 2001)/50. Sum is 49*651 = 31899. Adding 2001: 31899 + 2001 = 33900. Divided by 50: 33900 / 50 = 678. Which should be m + 27 = 651 + 27 = 678. Correct. So both equations check out. Therefore, the mean of S is 651.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 651.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{651}\n</think>"}
