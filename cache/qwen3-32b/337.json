Hmm, let me think. Alright, first step, I guess I need to remove the parentheses. But wait, there are no coefficients in front of the parentheses, right? So I don't need to distribute anything. Let me just write down the terms.\n\nStarting with (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). If I remove the parentheses, it becomes -k + 4 - 2 + 3k. Wait, is that right? Let me check. The first part is -k + 4, and then adding the second part, which is -2 + 3k. Yeah, so combining them all together, it's just those four terms: -k, +4, -2, +3k.\n\nNow I need to combine like terms. The like terms here would be the terms with k and the constant terms. So let's group them. The terms with k are -k and +3k. The constants are +4 and -2. Let me write that down.\n\nFor the k terms: -k + 3k. Hmm, that should be... let's see. If I have -1k + 3k, that would be (-1 + 3)k, which is 2k. Okay, so that part is 2k.\n\nNow for the constants: +4 - 2. That's straightforward. 4 minus 2 is 2. So combining those gives me +2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the simplified expression should be 2k + 2. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal expression: (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). Combine term by term:\n\n-k + 4 - 2 + 3k. Combine -k and 3k to get 2k. Combine 4 - 2 to get 2. Yep, so 2k + 2. That seems right.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe rearranging the terms first? Let me try that. Let's use the commutative property to rearrange the terms so that like terms are next to each other. So starting with -k + 4 - 2 + 3k, I can rearrange to (-k + 3k) + (4 - 2). Which again is 2k + 2. Same result. Okay, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor something out? Not sure if necessary, but let's see. The simplified form is 2k + 2. If I wanted to factor further, I could take out a 2, getting 2(k + 1). But the question just says simplify, so maybe 2k + 2 is sufficient. Unless there's a specific form they want, but since it's not specified, I think 2k + 2 is the simplified version.\n\nWait, let me verify once more by plugging in a value for k. Let's pick k = 1. Original expression: (-1 + 4) + (-2 + 3*1) = (3) + (1) = 4. Simplified expression: 2*1 + 2 = 4. Okay, same result.\n\nAnother test, k = 0. Original: (-0 + 4) + (-2 + 0) = 4 + (-2) = 2. Simplified: 2*0 + 2 = 2. Correct again.\n\nHow about k = 2? Original: (-2 + 4) + (-2 + 6) = (2) + (4) = 6. Simplified: 2*2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6. Perfect.\n\nSeems like my simplified expression is working. Therefore, I think the answer is 2k + 2. I don't see any mistakes in my steps. So yeah, combining like terms properly and checking with substitution. All good.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified expression is \\boxed{2k + 2}.\n</think>"}
