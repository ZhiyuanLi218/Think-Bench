The problem says that when the concentration of A is tripled and all other reactants are kept constant, the reaction rate also triples. Hmm, let me think about how rate laws work.\n\nI remember that the rate law for a reaction is generally expressed as Rate = k [A]^m [B]^n ..., where m, n are the orders with respect to each reactant. These orders are determined experimentally, right? So in this case, they're only changing the concentration of A and observing the effect on the rate. The other reactants' concentrations are held constant, so their contributions to the rate law shouldn't affect the determination of A's order.\n\nThe question is asking for the exponent for A, which is m in the rate law. The problem states that when [A] is tripled, the rate triples. Let me write that out mathematically. Let's say initially the rate is Rate₁ = k [A₁]^m. Then, in the second experiment, [A₂] = 3[A₁], and Rate₂ = k [A₂]^m = k (3[A₁])^m. According to the problem, Rate₂ is 3 times Rate₁. So:\n\nRate₂ = 3 * Rate₁\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\nk (3[A₁])^m = 3 * k [A₁]^m\n\nI can cancel out the k on both sides since it's a constant. That leaves:\n\n(3[A₁])^m = 3 [A₁]^m\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n3^m [A₁]^m = 3 [A₁]^m\n\nNow, if I divide both sides by [A₁]^m (assuming [A₁] ≠ 0, which it isn't in a real experiment), I get:\n\n3^m = 3\n\nSo 3 to the power of m equals 3. Well, 3^1 is 3, so m must be 1. Therefore, the exponent for A is 1. Let me check that again. If m=1, then tripling [A] would make the rate 3^1 = 3 times as fast, which matches what the problem states. So the answer should be A:1.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Suppose m was 2, then tripling [A] would lead to a 9-fold increase in rate. But the problem says the rate triples, so m can't be 2. If m was 0, the rate wouldn't change, but that's not the case here. So yeah, m=1 is the only exponent where tripling the concentration leads to a threefold increase in rate. So the answer must be A:1.\n</think>"}
