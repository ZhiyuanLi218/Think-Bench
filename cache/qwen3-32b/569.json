Let me start by recalling how Pascal's Triangle works. Each entry is a binomial coefficient, right? The entry in the nth row and kth position is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). \n\nThe problem is asking for three consecutive entries in some row such that their ratios are 3:4:5. Let me denote these three consecutive entries as C(n, k-1), C(n, k), and C(n, k+1). So, according to the problem, the ratio between these three should be 3:4:5. \n\nSo, translating that into equations, we can say:\n\nC(n, k) / C(n, k-1) = 4/3,\n\nand\n\nC(n, k+1) / C(n, k) = 5/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write both ratios and solve for n and k. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's recall the ratio between consecutive entries in Pascal's Triangle. The ratio of C(n, k) to C(n, k-1) is (n - k + 1)/k. Let me verify that. \n\nYes, because C(n, k) = C(n, k-1) * (n - k + 1)/k. For example, C(n, 1)/C(n, 0) = n/1, which is correct. Similarly, C(n, 2)/C(n, 1) = (n - 1)/2. So that formula seems right.\n\nTherefore, if I let the ratio between the second and first entry be 4/3, then:\n\n(n - k + 1)/k = 4/3.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio between the third and second entry is 5/4, so:\n\n(n - (k + 1) + 1)/(k + 1) = (n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) (n - k + 1)/k = 4/3,\n\n2) (n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4.\n\nLet me write these equations more clearly.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(n - k + 1)/k = 4/3.\n\nMultiply both sides by k:\n\nn - k + 1 = (4/3)k.\n\nThen, bringing all terms to one side:\n\nn + 1 = (4/3)k + k = (7/3)k.\n\nTherefore:\n\nn + 1 = (7/3)k => 3(n + 1) = 7k => 3n + 3 = 7k. Let me note this as equation (A).\n\nSecond equation:\n\n(n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4.\n\nMultiply both sides by (k + 1):\n\nn - k = (5/4)(k + 1).\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominator:\n\n4(n - k) = 5(k + 1).\n\nExpanding:\n\n4n - 4k = 5k + 5.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n4n - 4k - 5k - 5 = 0 => 4n - 9k - 5 = 0 => 4n - 9k = 5. Let me note this as equation (B).\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n(A): 3n + 3 = 7k,\n\n(B): 4n - 9k = 5.\n\nI need to solve for n and k. Let me express both equations in terms of n and k.\n\nFrom equation (A): 3n = 7k - 3 => n = (7k - 3)/3.\n\nLet me plug this into equation (B):\n\n4*(7k - 3)/3 - 9k = 5.\n\nMultiply through by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n4*(7k - 3) - 27k = 15.\n\nCompute:\n\n28k - 12 - 27k = 15 => (28k - 27k) - 12 = 15 => k - 12 = 15 => k = 15 + 12 = 27.\n\nSo k = 27. Now plug back into equation (A):\n\n3n + 3 = 7k => 3n + 3 = 7*27 = 189 => 3n = 189 - 3 = 186 => n = 186 / 3 = 62.\n\nTherefore, n = 62 and k = 27. Therefore, the three consecutive entries in row 62, positions k=26, 27, 28? Wait, hold on. Wait, if k is 27, then the three consecutive entries would be C(62, 26), C(62, 27), C(62, 28)? Wait, no. Wait, the three entries are C(n, k-1), C(n, k), C(n, k+1). Since k is 27, then they are C(62, 26), C(62, 27), C(62, 28). So the row is 62, and the three consecutive entries are at positions 26, 27, 28. \n\nBut let me verify if this is correct. Let me check if the ratios are indeed 3:4:5. \n\nFirst, compute C(62, 27)/C(62, 26) should be 4/3.\n\nUsing the ratio formula: C(n, k)/C(n, k-1) = (n - k + 1)/k. So here, n = 62, k = 27. Therefore, ratio is (62 - 27 + 1)/27 = (36)/27 = 4/3. Correct. \n\nThen, C(62, 28)/C(62, 27) should be 5/4. Again, using the ratio formula: (n - k + 1)/k where now k is 28. Wait, no, the ratio C(n, k+1)/C(n, k) is (n - k)/(k + 1). Let me check again. Earlier, we had for the second ratio:\n\n(n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4. Plugging in n = 62, k = 27: (62 - 27)/(27 + 1) = 35/28 = 5/4. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratios are indeed 4/3 and 5/4, so the three consecutive entries are in ratio 3:4:5. Therefore, the answer is row 62. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there could be another solution. Because sometimes with ratios, there might be multiple solutions or constraints. But given that we solved the equations and found integer solutions for k and n, and since Pascal's triangle rows are symmetric, maybe there's another occurrence in the same row? For example, if there is another set of three consecutive entries with ratio 3:4:5 on the other side of the triangle. But given the symmetry, if there's a ratio 3:4:5 on one side, there would be 5:4:3 on the other side. But since we need exactly 3:4:5, maybe there's only one occurrence in the row. \n\nBut let me think: suppose in row n, entries C(n, k-1):C(n, k):C(n, k+1) = 3:4:5. Because of the symmetry C(n, k) = C(n, n - k), so if there's such a triplet at position k-1, k, k+1, there would be another triplet at positions n - (k + 1), n - k, n - (k - 1), which would be in reverse order. So unless 3:4:5 is symmetric, which it isn't, so only one occurrence in the row. Therefore, row 62 is the answer. \n\nBut let me check with smaller numbers to see if maybe there is a smaller row where this occurs. For example, maybe my equations have another solution where n and k are integers? Let me check.\n\nWe had equations:\n\nFrom equation (A): 3n + 3 = 7k,\n\nand equation (B): 4n - 9k = 5.\n\nWe solved and found k = 27, n = 62. Let me check if there are other solutions. Suppose k and n are positive integers with k ≥ 1, n ≥ 2k? Or something?\n\nWait, since in Pascal's triangle, entries are defined for 0 ≤ k ≤ n. So for the three consecutive entries, we need k-1 ≥ 0 and k+1 ≤ n. Therefore, k ≥ 1 and k ≤ n - 1. So with our solution, k = 27, n = 62. So k+1 = 28 ≤ 62, yes. So that's valid. \n\nBut suppose there are other solutions. Let me see. Let me try solving equations again. \n\nFrom equation (A): 3n = 7k - 3 => n = (7k - 3)/3.\n\nSince n must be integer, 7k - 3 must be divisible by 3. Let me write 7k ≡ 3 mod 3. Since 7 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 7k ≡ k ≡ 3 mod 3 => k ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, k must be a multiple of 3. Let me denote k = 3m, where m is a positive integer. Then, substituting back:\n\nn = (7*(3m) - 3)/3 = (21m - 3)/3 = 7m - 1.\n\nTherefore, n = 7m - 1, k = 3m. Now, let's substitute into equation (B):\n\n4n - 9k = 5.\n\nSubstituting n = 7m - 1 and k = 3m:\n\n4*(7m - 1) - 9*(3m) = 28m - 4 - 27m = m - 4 = 5 => m = 9.\n\nTherefore, m = 9, so k = 3*9 = 27, n = 7*9 - 1 = 63 - 1 = 62. Therefore, the only solution is m = 9, leading to n = 62. Therefore, there are no other solutions for positive integers m. Because if m is less than 9, then m - 4 = 5 would not hold. Therefore, this is the unique solution. \n\nTherefore, the answer is row 62. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with m = 8. If m = 8, then k = 24, n = 7*8 -1 = 55. Let's check equation (B):\n\n4n - 9k = 4*55 - 9*24 = 220 - 216 = 4, which is not equal to 5. Similarly, m = 10: k = 30, n = 7*10 -1 = 69. Then 4*69 - 9*30 = 276 - 270 = 6 ≠ 5. So only m=9 gives 5. Therefore, unique solution. \n\nTherefore, the answer is row 62. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me compute the actual values of C(62, 26), C(62, 27), C(62, 28) and check their ratios. \n\nBut calculating such large binomial coefficients might be tedious by hand, but maybe I can compute the ratios using the formulas. \n\nFirst, C(n, k)/C(n, k-1) = (n - k + 1)/k. For k = 27:\n\n(n - k + 1)/k = (62 - 27 + 1)/27 = (36)/27 = 4/3. So that's 4/3, so the ratio between C(62,27)/C(62,26) is 4/3. \n\nSimilarly, C(n, k + 1)/C(n, k) = (n - k)/(k + 1). For k = 27:\n\n(62 - 27)/(27 + 1) = 35/28 = 5/4. Therefore, C(62,28)/C(62,27) is 5/4. Therefore, the three entries are in ratio 3:4:5. \n\nTherefore, the answer is row 62. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"three consecutive entries occur that are in the ratio 3:4:5\". Let me just check if there's any possible mistake in my equations. For example, maybe the problem is referring to three consecutive entries in the middle of a row, but due to the symmetry, maybe there's another occurrence? But as discussed earlier, because of the symmetry, if there is a 3:4:5 ratio, then on the other side there would be 5:4:3. Therefore, only one occurrence of 3:4:5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another set of equations if the ratios are not between consecutive entries? But the problem says three consecutive entries, so they have to be next to each other. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to set up the ratios. For example, maybe the problem is considering the three entries as C(n, k-1):C(n, k):C(n, k+1) = 3:4:5. Therefore, not only the ratio between the first and second is 3:4, but also between the second and third is 4:5. Which is exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, someone might think that maybe the ratios are between the three numbers in sequence, meaning that C(n, k)/C(n, k-1) = 4/3 and C(n, k+1)/C(n, k) = 5/4, which is exactly what I did. So that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the row is 62.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{62}\n</think>"}
