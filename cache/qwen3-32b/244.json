Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that when 49 grams of KClO3 decomposes, the resulting O2 reacts with 10.8 grams of an impure metal (which is 20% pure) to form a metal oxide. Then, I need to calculate the amount of carbon needed to convert that metal oxide back to pure metal. The metal is amphoteric and one of the most abundant in the Earth's crust. The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I should identify the metal. The question mentions it's amphoteric and one of the most abundant metals. The most abundant metals in the Earth's crust are aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, etc. Among these, aluminum is amphoteric because it can react with both acids and bases. Iron is not amphoteric. So the metal is likely aluminum.\n\nSo the metal is aluminum. Let me confirm. Aluminum is indeed amphoteric, and it's the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust. Okay, so the metal is Al.\n\nNow, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the decomposition of KClO3. The reaction for that is:\n\n2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2\n\nSo, when KClO3 decomposes, it produces O2 gas. Then this O2 reacts with the impure metal (which is 20% pure Al) to form metal oxide, which is Al2O3.\n\nThen, we need to find out how much carbon is needed to reduce Al2O3 back to Al metal. But the process of reducing Al2O3 typically uses electrolysis (Hall-Héroult process), not carbon. However, maybe the problem is simplifying it and assuming a reaction like:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nBut wait, carbon is used in some metal reduction reactions, like for iron. However, for aluminum oxide, carbon might not be the usual reductant because aluminum is more reactive than carbon. So maybe this is a hypothetical scenario for the problem's sake. The problem says to calculate the carbon needed, so I have to go with that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find moles of KClO3 decomposed to get O2.\n2. Use the O2 to find out how much Al2O3 is formed from the impure metal.\n3. Then, use the moles of Al2O3 to find the moles of C needed to reduce it back to Al.\n4. Convert moles of C to grams.\n\nLet me start with the first step.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of KClO3. The molar mass of KClO3 is K (39.1 g/mol) + Cl (35.45 g/mol) + 3 O (16*3=48 g/mol). So total is 39.1 + 35.45 + 48 = let's calculate:\n\n39.1 + 35.45 = 74.55 + 48 = 122.55 g/mol.\n\nGiven mass is 49 g. So moles of KClO3 = 49 g / 122.55 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that.\n\n49 divided by 122.55. Let me approximate. 122.55 is roughly 122.5 g/mol. So 49 / 122.5 = 0.4 mol. Wait, 49 is exactly half of 98, but 122.5 is double of 61.25. Wait, 49 / 122.5 is 0.4? Let me check:\n\n122.5 * 0.4 = 49.0. Yes! So exactly 0.4 moles of KClO3. Since the molar mass is approximated as 122.5 g/mol, but the actual molar mass is 122.55, which is very close, so the difference is negligible. So moles of KClO3 = 0.4 mol.\n\nNow, from the decomposition reaction:\n\n2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2\n\nSo, 2 moles of KClO3 produce 3 moles of O2. Therefore, the mole ratio is 2:3. So moles of O2 produced = (3/2) * moles of KClO3.\n\nSo moles of O2 = 3/2 * 0.4 = 0.6 mol.\n\nSo we have 0.6 moles of O2 gas.\n\nNow, this O2 reacts with the impure metal (which is 20% pure Al) to form Al2O3.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much pure Al is present in the 10.8 g of impure metal.\n\nThe impure metal is 20% pure. So mass of pure Al = 10.8 g * 0.20 = 2.16 g.\n\nMolar mass of Al is 27 g/mol. So moles of Al = 2.16 g / 27 g/mol = 0.08 mol.\n\nNow, let's write the reaction between Al and O2 to form Al2O3.\n\nThe balanced equation is:\n\n4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3\n\nSo, 4 moles of Al react with 3 moles of O2 to produce 2 moles of Al2O3.\n\nWe need to find out if O2 or Al is the limiting reagent here.\n\nWe have 0.08 mol of Al and 0.6 mol of O2.\n\nLet me find the mole ratio required by the reaction.\n\nFor 4 moles of Al, we need 3 moles of O2. So the mole ratio of Al:O2 is 4:3, or 1.333:1.\n\nLet me calculate the actual mole ratio of Al to O2.\n\nWe have 0.08 mol Al and 0.6 mol O2. So ratio is 0.08 / 0.6 = 0.133. Which is much less than 1.333. So that means Al is the limiting reagent here. Because for the amount of O2 available, we would need (0.6 mol O2) * (4/3) = 0.8 mol Al. But we only have 0.08 mol Al. Therefore, Al is limiting.\n\nTherefore, all the Al will be consumed in the reaction.\n\nSo, based on the stoichiometry, 4 moles Al → 2 moles Al2O3. Therefore, moles of Al2O3 formed = (2/4) * moles of Al = 0.5 * 0.08 = 0.04 mol.\n\nSo we have 0.04 moles of Al2O3.\n\nNow, the next part: reducing Al2O3 back to Al using carbon.\n\nAssuming the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nBut wait, let me check the balanced equation. Let me balance it.\n\nAl2O3 + C → Al + CO\n\nLet me balance this.\n\nAl: 2 on left, 1 on right. O: 3 on left, 1 on right (in CO). Let's try.\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nYes, that works:\n\nAl: 2 on left, 2 on right.\n\nO: 3 on left, 3*1=3 on right.\n\nC: 3 on left, 3 on right. So balanced.\n\nSo the balanced equation is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nSo for each mole of Al2O3, we need 3 moles of C.\n\nWe have 0.04 moles of Al2O3. Therefore, moles of C needed = 3 * 0.04 = 0.12 mol.\n\nNow, convert moles of C to grams. Molar mass of C is 12 g/mol.\n\nMass of C = 0.12 mol * 12 g/mol = 1.44 g.\n\nWait, but none of the options are 1.44 g. The options are A: 0.06 g, B: 0.36 g, C: 0.72 g, D: 0.48 g.\n\nHmm, so something's wrong here. Maybe my assumption about the reaction is wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nFirst, decomposition of KClO3: 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. 49 g / 122.5 g/mol = 0.4 mol KClO3. So 0.4 * (3/2) = 0.6 mol O2. That's correct.\n\nThen, reaction with Al. The impure metal is 20% pure. So 10.8 g * 0.2 = 2.16 g Al. Moles Al: 2.16 / 27 = 0.08 mol. Correct.\n\nReaction 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So 4 Al : 3 O2. Since Al is limiting, moles of Al2O3 is 0.08 * (2/4) = 0.04 mol. Correct.\n\nThen, reduction of Al2O3 with carbon. The balanced equation I used is Al2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO. So 3 moles of C per mole of Al2O3. So 0.04 * 3 = 0.12 mol C. 0.12 * 12 = 1.44 g. But that's not among the options. So where's the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is different? Let me think. Maybe the reaction is not producing CO but CO2?\n\nLet me try balancing Al2O3 + C → Al + CO2.\n\nAl2O3 + C → Al + CO2\n\nLeft: Al:2, O:3, C:1\n\nRight: Al:1, O:2, C:1\n\nLet me balance Al first. 2 Al on left, so 2 Al on right:\n\nAl2O3 + C → 2 Al + CO2\n\nNow Al is balanced. Now O: 3 on left, 2 on right. Let me adjust CO2. Let me use 3 CO2? Let me try:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO2\n\nNow O: 3 on left, 3*2=6 on right. Not balanced. So maybe:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nAs before, which balances O: 3 on left, 3 on right. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another reaction? For example, if it's a different stoichiometry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO\n\nWait, that would be:\n\nLeft: 2 Al, 3 O, 3 C\n\nRight: 4 Al, 3 C, 3 O. So Al is not balanced. 2 on left, 4 on right. So multiply left by 2:\n\n2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO\n\nNo, O would be 6 on left, 3 on right. So maybe:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO. Which is balanced. So that's correct. So the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Al2O3 reacting with 3 moles of C.\n\nSo according to that, 0.04 mol Al2O3 would need 0.12 mol C, which is 1.44 g. But that's not an option. So perhaps my earlier steps are wrong?\n\nLet me check again the moles of O2 and Al.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the reaction between Al and O2?\n\nThe reaction is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3.\n\nSo moles of Al is 0.08, moles of O2 is 0.6.\n\nLet me calculate the stoichiometric ratio required. For every 4 moles of Al, 3 moles of O2 are needed.\n\nSo, for 0.08 moles of Al, how much O2 is needed?\n\n(3/4) * 0.08 = 0.06 moles of O2.\n\nSince we have 0.6 moles of O2 available, which is way more than 0.06, Al is indeed limiting. Therefore, all Al is consumed. So moles of Al2O3 is 0.08 * (2/4) = 0.04 mol. That's correct.\n\nSo the problem is in the next step. Maybe the reaction with carbon is different? Or perhaps the question is not about the reaction with carbon but another process?\n\nWait, the problem says \"calculate the amount of carbon needed to convert the metal oxide back to pure metal.\" Maybe the reaction is not direct? Maybe it's a different reaction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the metal? The question says the metal is amphoteric and one of the most abundant. If it's not Al, maybe another metal?\n\nWait, let me think again. The most abundant metals in Earth's crust: oxygen is the most abundant element, but metals... The top metals are oxygen (non-metal), but among metals: aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium. Of these, aluminum is amphoteric. Iron is not amphoteric. Calcium reacts with water, but is it amphoteric? Calcium oxide is basic. So probably not. So the metal is definitely Al.\n\nSo the problem is in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is not about reducing Al2O3 with carbon, but with carbon monoxide? Or maybe another reaction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different stoichiometry. For example, in the reaction of carbon with metal oxide, maybe the carbon is acting as a reducing agent, but the stoichiometry is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not about Al2O3, but another oxide? But if the metal is Al, then oxide is Al2O3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles of Al?\n\nLet me check:\n\nImpure metal is 10.8 g, 20% purity. So pure metal is 10.8 * 0.2 = 2.16 g. Molar mass of Al is 27 g/mol. 2.16 / 27 = 0.08 mol. Correct.\n\nReaction with O2: 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So 4 moles Al produce 2 moles Al2O3. So 0.08 moles Al produce 0.04 moles Al2O3. Correct.\n\nThen, reduction of Al2O3 with carbon. Let me check the stoichiometry again. Suppose the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nMolar ratio is 1:3. So 0.04 moles Al2O3 needs 0.12 moles C. 0.12 * 12 = 1.44 g. But the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the reaction?\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the problem is not using the reaction with carbon but using carbon in another way. For example, in the thermite reaction? Wait, no, thermite is usually Fe2O3 + Al → Fe + Al2O3. Not involving carbon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not about the reaction of Al2O3 with carbon but about another oxide?\n\nWait, maybe the metal is not Al? Let me check again. The problem says the metal is amphoteric. If I considered another metal... Let me think. For example, zinc is amphoteric, but it's not as abundant as Al. Tin is also amphoteric. But the most abundant... Hmm. Maybe the metal is not Al? Maybe I made a wrong assumption here.\n\nWait, let me check the abundance. The top elements in Earth's crust by mass:\n\nOxygen (non-metal), Silicon (non-metal), Aluminum, Iron, Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium... So among metals, Al is the most abundant. So the metal is Al. So my assumption is correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the question is not about the entire Al2O3 being reduced? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry of the decomposition of KClO3?\n\nWait, let me check the decomposition of KClO3 again. The reaction is 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. So 2 moles of KClO3 produce 3 moles of O2. So 0.4 moles KClO3 gives 0.6 moles O2. Correct.\n\nSo why is the answer not matching? Let me check the options again. The options are A:0.06 g, B:0.36 g, C:0.72 g, D:0.48 g. My calculation gives 1.44 g, which is not there. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry of the carbon reaction?\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is not 1 mole of Al2O3 reacting with 3 moles of C, but something else?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nBut maybe I need to consider that each mole of CO has one C, so 3 CO requires 3 C. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + C → Al + CO2\n\nLet me balance that:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO2\n\nCheck:\n\nAl: 2 on left, 2 on right.\n\nO: 3 on left, 3*2=6 on right. Not balanced. So need more O on left. Maybe:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nWhich is balanced as before. So that's the correct reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes a different reaction, such as:\n\nAl2O3 + C → Al + CO\n\nUnbalanced. Let me balance it properly.\n\nAl: 2 on left, 1 on right. Multiply Al by 2:\n\nAl2O3 + C → 2 Al + CO\n\nO: 3 on left, 1 on right. Multiply CO by 3:\n\nAl2O3 + C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nNow O: 3 on left, 3 on right. C: 1 on left, 3 on right. So need 3 C on left:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO. Same as before. So balanced. So the stoichiometry is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation should be correct. But the answer isn't among the options. So maybe there is a miscalculation earlier?\n\nLet me go back.\n\nStarting again:\n\nMass of KClO3 is 49 g. Molar mass KClO3 is K (39.1) + Cl (35.45) + 3*16 = 39.1 + 35.45 + 48 = 122.55 g/mol. So 49 / 122.55 ≈ 0.4 mol. Correct.\n\nDecomposition gives 0.6 mol O2. Correct.\n\nImpure metal is 10.8 g, 20% pure. So 2.16 g Al. Moles Al: 2.16 / 27 = 0.08 mol. Correct.\n\nReaction with O2: 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. Al is limiting. Moles of Al2O3 = 0.04 mol. Correct.\n\nReduction: Al2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO. Moles C = 0.12 mol. 0.12 * 12 = 1.44 g. Not in options.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem expects the use of a different molar mass? For example, if the molar mass of KClO3 is approximated as 122.5 g/mol, and the calculation is done with exact numbers?\n\nLet me recalculate moles of KClO3 with exact molar mass.\n\nMolar mass of KClO3:\n\nK: 39.10 g/mol\n\nCl: 35.45 g/mol\n\nO: 16.00 * 3 = 48.00 g/mol\n\nTotal: 39.10 + 35.45 + 48.00 = 122.55 g/mol.\n\nGiven mass is 49.00 g.\n\nMoles of KClO3 = 49.00 / 122.55 ≈ 0.4 mol exactly? Let me calculate:\n\n122.55 * 0.4 = 49.02 g. The given mass is 49.00 g, so it's slightly less. Let me calculate more precisely:\n\n49.00 / 122.55 = ?\n\nLet me compute 49 / 122.55:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 7: 7 / 17.507 ≈ 0.4 mol approximately. The exact value is approximately 0.4 mol. The difference is negligible for the purposes of this problem, so 0.4 mol is correct.\n\nHmm. So maybe the mistake is in the reaction of Al with O2? Let me check the stoichiometry again.\n\nThe balanced equation is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3.\n\nIf I have 0.08 mol Al, how much O2 is consumed?\n\nFrom the ratio, 4 mol Al consumes 3 mol O2.\n\nSo moles of O2 consumed = (3/4) * 0.08 = 0.06 mol.\n\nBut we have 0.6 mol O2 available. So O2 is in excess. Therefore, Al is limiting. So moles of Al2O3 formed is (2/4)*0.08 = 0.04 mol. Correct.\n\nSo the problem must be elsewhere. Let me check the question again.\n\nWait, the question says \"calculate the amount of carbon needed to convert the metal oxide back to pure metal.\"\n\nBut in reality, aluminum is produced via electrolysis, not with carbon. Maybe the problem is using a hypothetical reaction, but perhaps I need to consider that the reaction is different?\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nBut maybe the question is using a different stoichiometry? Let me check the balanced equation again.\n\nYes, it's balanced. So maybe there is a mistake in the problem's given numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles of Al?\n\nWait, the impure metal is 10.8 g of 20% purity. So pure metal is 10.8 * 0.2 = 2.16 g. Correct. Molar mass of Al is 27 g/mol. 2.16 / 27 = 0.08 mol. Correct.\n\nWait, unless the metal isn't Al? But the question says it's amphoteric and one of the most abundant. If I consider another metal, like maybe magnesium? But magnesium isn't amphoteric. Iron isn't. Calcium is basic. Zinc is amphoteric but not as abundant. Tin is amphoteric but less abundant.\n\nWait, maybe the metal is not aluminum? But the question says it's one of the most abundant and amphoteric. Aluminum is the only one that fits. Unless the question is referring to another metal. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe the metal is not aluminum but another one. For example, let's assume the metal is something else. Suppose the metal is, say, lead? No, lead is not one of the most abundant. Or maybe chromium? Chromium is amphoteric? Chromium(III) oxide is amphoteric. Chromium is in the Earth's crust, but not as abundant as Al. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to bauxite, which is the ore of aluminum. But still, the metal is Al.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different oxide. For example, if the metal is not Al but something else, and the oxide has a different formula.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula of the metal oxide? If the metal is +3, like Al, then oxide is Al2O3. If it's a different oxidation state...\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is +2, and oxide is MO. Let's suppose that. Let's try that approach.\n\nAssume the metal is +2, oxide is MO. Then, the reaction with O2 would be:\n\n2 M + O2 → 2 MO\n\nBut then, if the metal is +2, and it's amphoteric. Which metals are amphoteric and +2? Zinc is amphoteric and can be +2. Zinc is not one of the most abundant metals in the crust. Let's see abundance: Zn is about 0.007%, which is much less than Al's ~8%. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is +1? But no, amphoteric metals typically are +3, like Al.\n\nSo I think my initial assumption of Al is correct. Therefore, the problem must be in the calculation. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not about reducing all the metal oxide? Maybe there's a mistake in the stoichiometry of the reduction reaction.\n\nWait, let me think: if the metal is Al, and the oxide is Al2O3, and we need to reduce it with carbon. The balanced equation is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nSo 1 mole Al2O3 needs 3 moles C. So for 0.04 moles Al2O3, need 0.12 moles C. 0.12 * 12 = 1.44 g. But the answer is not there. So maybe I need to check if the question is asking for something else?\n\nWait, the question says \"calculate the amount of carbon needed to convert the metal oxide back to pure metal.\" Maybe it's not complete conversion? Or maybe there's a different reaction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO\n\nWait, let's check the stoichiometry:\n\nLeft: 2 Al, 3 O, 3 C.\n\nRight: 4 Al, 3 C, 3 O. Al is not balanced. 2 vs 4. So multiply left by 2:\n\n2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO\n\nNow O is 6 on left, 3 on right. Still not balanced. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nWhich is balanced as before. So 3 moles of C per mole of Al2O3.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a different reaction where carbon is used in a different way. For example, maybe it's not CO but CO2?\n\nLet me try:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO2\n\nCheck balance:\n\nAl: 2 on both sides.\n\nO: 3 on left, 3*2=6 on right. Not balanced. So need more O on left. Let me try:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C + 3 O2 → 2 Al + 3 CO2\n\nBut that introduces O2, which is not part of the problem. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO\n\nWhich is balanced. So that's correct.\n\nSo the problem must be in the earlier steps. Wait, let me check the moles of O2 again. Maybe I made a mistake in the decomposition of KClO3?\n\nWait, the reaction is 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. So for every 2 moles of KClO3, you get 3 moles of O2. So 0.4 moles KClO3 gives (3/2)*0.4 = 0.6 moles O2. Correct.\n\nReaction with Al: 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So moles of O2 consumed is 0.06, as before. Correct.\n\nSo moles of Al2O3 is 0.04. Correct.\n\nThen reduction requires 0.12 moles C, which is 1.44 g. But this is not among the options. So perhaps the question is using a different molar mass for carbon? No, carbon is 12 g/mol.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the amount of carbon in moles instead of grams? No, the options are in grams.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of grams of C? 0.12 mol * 12 g/mol = 1.44 g. Correct.\n\nWait, maybe there is a mistake in the problem statement? For example, maybe the mass of KClO3 is 4.9 g instead of 49 g? If it were 4.9 g, then moles would be 0.04 mol, leading to 0.06 mol O2, then leading to... Let me check.\n\nBut the problem says 49 g. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the impure metal is 20% by mass, but I assumed that the impurity is non-metallic. But the problem says it's impure metal, so maybe the impurity is another metal? But the problem says it's a metal, so the impurity is non-metal? Not sure, but the calculation is based on 20% pure Al.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the reaction between Al and O2 is different? Let me check.\n\nSuppose the reaction is 2 Al + 3/2 O2 → Al2O3. Which is the same as 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So same as before.\n\nSo no mistake there.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the amount of carbon in the metal oxide? No, the question says to calculate carbon needed to convert the oxide back to pure metal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the carbon is in the form of CO2? No, the reaction produces CO.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using a different stoichiometry for the reduction. For example, if it's:\n\nAl2O3 + C → Al + CO\n\nBut unbalanced. Let me balance it properly.\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO. Which is what I had before.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a different stoichiometric ratio? For example, if the reaction is Al2O3 + C → Al + CO2, then let's balance that.\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO2\n\nCheck:\n\nAl: 2 on both sides.\n\nO: 3 on left, 3*2=6 on right. Not balanced. So need more O on left. Let me try:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C + 3/2 O2 → 2 Al + 3 CO2\n\nBut that introduces O2, which is not present. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different reaction where less carbon is used? For example, if it's:\n\nAl2O3 + C → 2 Al + CO3^2- ? No, that's not a gas reaction.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the entire Al2O3 being reduced? Let me check the options. The options are 0.06, 0.36, 0.72, 0.48 grams. These are all fractions of 0.12 * 12 = 1.44. Let me see:\n\nIf the correct answer is 0.36 g, that would be 0.03 mol C (0.36 / 12 = 0.03). How could that happen?\n\nIf the moles of C needed were 0.03 mol, that would mean moles of Al2O3 is 0.01 mol, since 0.01 * 3 = 0.03. Where did I go wrong?\n\nIf the moles of Al2O3 were 0.01 instead of 0.04, that would mean the moles of Al was 0.02, leading to 0.02 * 27 = 0.54 g Al. But the pure Al was 2.16 g. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the moles of Al2O3. Let me think: if the reaction between Al and O2 produced less Al2O3, but how?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry of the Al and O2 reaction. Let me recheck.\n\nReaction: 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3\n\nIf 0.08 moles of Al reacts, how many moles of Al2O3 is formed?\n\nFrom the reaction, 4 moles Al → 2 moles Al2O3, so 0.08 moles Al → (2/4)*0.08 = 0.04 moles Al2O3. Correct.\n\nSo no mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a different formula for the oxide? For example, if the oxide is AlO instead of Al2O3? But that would not be correct. Al is +3, O is -2, so formula is Al2O3.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about all the Al2O3 being reduced? But the question says \"convert the metal oxide back to pure metal,\" implying complete reduction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the amount of carbon in the metal oxide, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the molar mass of KClO3? Let me check again.\n\nK: 39.1 g/mol, Cl: 35.45 g/mol, O: 16*3=48 g/mol. Total: 39.1 + 35.45 = 74.55 + 48 = 122.55 g/mol. Correct. 49 g / 122.55 g/mol ≈ 0.4 mol. Correct.\n\nWait, maybe the decomposition of KClO3 is different? For example, sometimes KClO3 decomposes with a catalyst like MnO2 to give KCl and O2, which is what I used. But if it decomposes without a catalyst, it might give KClO4 and KCl? No, that's not common. The standard decomposition is 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. My calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Maybe there's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I missed a step?\n\nWait, let me think: the problem says \"calculate the amount of carbon needed to convert the metal oxide back to pure metal.\" Maybe it's not the entire amount, but just for a part? Or maybe there is a limiting factor I missed?\n\nWait, maybe the reaction between Al and O2 is not complete? But the problem states that the O2 reacts with the metal to form oxide, so I assume it's complete.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the question is asking for the amount of carbon in the metal oxide, but no, it's asking to reduce it.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are A:0.06 g, B:0.36 g, C:0.72 g, D:0.48 g.\n\nIf I consider that maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry of the carbon reaction, let's see: if instead of 3 moles of C per mole of Al2O3, it's 1 mole of C per mole of Al2O3, then 0.04 * 12 = 0.48 g, which is option D. But why would the stoichiometry be 1:1?\n\nLet me think: if the reaction were Al2O3 + C → 2 Al + CO3^something, but that's not realistic. Alternatively, if it's a different reaction.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + C → 2 AlO + CO\n\nBut AlO is not a stable compound. Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a simple reduction without forming CO, like:\n\nAl2O3 + C → Al + CO\n\nBut balanced:\n\nAl2O3 + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO. Same as before.\n\nWait, unless the problem assumes a different reaction, like:\n\nAl2O3 + 3/2 C → 2 Al + 3/2 CO\n\nWhich is the same as multiplying by 2: 2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO. But for 1 mole of Al2O3, it's 3/2 C. So 0.04 * 3/2 = 0.06 moles of C. 0.06 * 12 = 0.72 g. Which is option C.\n\nWait, this is interesting. If the balanced equation is written as:\n\n2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO\n\nThen, for 1 mole of Al2O3, you need 3/2 moles of C. So 0.04 moles of Al2O3 would require 0.04 * (3/2) = 0.06 moles of C. 0.06 * 12 = 0.72 g, which is option C.\n\nBut why would the balanced equation be written as 2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO? Let me check the stoichiometry.\n\nLeft side: 2 Al2O3 has 4 Al, 6 O.\n\n3 C.\n\nRight side: 4 Al, 3 CO has 3 C and 3 O.\n\nSo O: 6 on left, 3 on right. Not balanced. Wait, no, that's not balanced. Wait, 2 Al2O3 has 6 O, and 3 CO has 3 O. So O is not balanced. To balance O, need 3 CO2 on the right?\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf I have 2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO2\n\nLeft: 2*Al2O3 = 4 Al, 6 O; 3 C.\n\nRight: 4 Al, 3 C, 6 O (from 3 CO2).\n\nYes, balanced! Al: 4 on both sides. O: 6 on both sides. C: 3 on both sides.\n\nSo the balanced equation is:\n\n2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO2\n\nSo for every 2 moles of Al2O3, you need 3 moles of C. So per mole of Al2O3, you need 3/2 moles of C.\n\nSo if we have 0.04 moles of Al2O3, then moles of C needed is 0.04 * (3/2) = 0.06 moles. 0.06 * 12 g/mol = 0.72 g, which is option C.\n\nAh! So I think I made a mistake in the balanced equation earlier. I assumed the product was CO, but if it's CO2, then the stoichiometry changes. The problem didn't specify the product, so I assumed CO, but maybe the correct balanced equation produces CO2, which would change the stoichiometry.\n\nSo let's go through this again.\n\nIf the reaction is:\n\nAl2O3 + C → Al + CO2\n\nBalanced equation is 2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO2\n\nSo for each mole of Al2O3, 3/2 moles of C are needed.\n\nTherefore, for 0.04 moles of Al2O3, moles of C = 0.04 * 3/2 = 0.06 mol.\n\nMass of C = 0.06 * 12 = 0.72 g, which is option C.\n\nThis must be the correct approach, and my earlier assumption of CO was incorrect. The problem didn't specify the product, but depending on the reaction conditions, it could produce CO or CO2. Since the problem is giving an answer that matches option C, this must be the intended path.\n\nSo why did I assume CO earlier? Well, in some reduction reactions, CO is the product, but in others, especially with excess oxygen, CO2 is formed. Since the problem didn't specify, but the answer is among the options, it must be that the intended reaction produces CO2, leading to option C: 0.72 g.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 0.72 g.\n\nLet me verify this again:\n\n1. KClO3 decomposition: 0.4 mol → 0.6 mol O2.\n\n2. Al from impure metal: 2.16 g → 0.08 mol Al.\n\n3. Reaction with O2: produces 0.04 mol Al2O3.\n\n4. Reduction with carbon: 0.04 mol Al2O3 requires 0.06 mol C (since 2 Al2O3 + 3 C → 4 Al + 3 CO2).\n\n5. 0.06 mol * 12 g/mol = 0.72 g. Correct.\n\nYes, this makes sense now. I think I initially assumed the wrong product for the carbon reaction, leading to an incorrect stoichiometry. The correct balanced equation producing CO2 gives the stoichiometry that matches one of the options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
