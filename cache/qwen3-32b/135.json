Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, by the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root p/q of the polynomial must have p dividing the constant term a_0 and q dividing the leading coefficient a_n. In this case, since all roots are integers, q must be ±1, so all roots are integers dividing 66. Also, since the roots are distinct, we need to consider all distinct integer divisors of 66.\n\nSo first, let me list all the integer divisors of 66. The prime factorization of 66 is 2 × 3 × 11. Therefore, the positive divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66. The negative divisors would be -1, -2, -3, -6, -11, -22, -33, -66. So all possible integer roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66.\n\nNow, since the polynomial has leading coefficient 2, if we consider the monic polynomial (leading coefficient 1) with those roots, then multiplying by 2 would give us the leading coefficient of 2. However, since the polynomial isn't necessarily monic, we need to consider that the roots might be scaled somehow. Wait, no. Actually, if we have a polynomial with leading coefficient 2, and roots r1, r2, ..., rn, then the polynomial can be written as 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). So the roots are integers, and the polynomial is scaled by 2. Therefore, Vieta's formula will apply here.\n\nVieta's formula tells us that for a polynomial f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_0, the sum of the roots (with multiplicity) is -a_{n-1}/a_n. Since all roots are distinct integers, and a_n is 2, then the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/2. Therefore, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. Therefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize |sum of roots|. So the problem reduces to selecting a set of distinct integer divisors of 66 (positive and negative) such that their product is 66 divided by some factors... Wait, hold on. Wait, the product of the roots multiplied by 2 (the leading coefficient) times (-1)^n equals the constant term a_0. Let me check.\n\nFor a monic polynomial, the product of the roots is (-1)^n * a_0 / a_n. Wait, Vieta's formula for the product of roots is (-1)^n * a_0 / a_n. But in our case, the polynomial is 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Let me expand this. Let me denote the monic polynomial as P(x) = (x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Then f(x) = 2*P(x). Therefore, the constant term of f(x) is 2*(-1)^n * (product of roots). Therefore, a_0 = 2*(-1)^n * (product of roots). Therefore, product of roots = (-1)^n * a_0 / 2 = (-1)^n * 66 / 2 = (-1)^n * 33. Therefore, the product of the roots is ±33. Therefore, the product of the roots must be 33 or -33, depending on the degree n. But since n can vary, depending on how many roots we take. However, note that the product of the roots is ±33, and each root is a divisor of 66, so let's think about that.\n\nSo we need a set of distinct integers (each being divisors of 66) whose product is ±33. Also, since the roots are distinct integers, we need to select a combination of these divisors such that their product is ±33, and then find the combination where the sum of the roots has minimal absolute value, because |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to:\n\nFind a set of distinct integers (from the list of divisors of 66) whose product is ±33, such that the absolute value of their sum is minimized. Then multiply that minimal sum by 2 to get |a_{n-1}|.\n\nSo first, let's note that 33 factors into 3 × 11. So to get a product of 33 or -33, we need to have factors of 3 and 11, possibly with other factors whose product is 1 or -1. However, since all roots are distinct integers, we need to consider how to combine the divisors to get 33 or -33.\n\nBut since 33 is 3×11, and 66 is 2×3×11. Therefore, the divisors of 66 include 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66 and their negatives. So if we want a product of 33, we can have:\n\nOption 1: 33 and 1. But 33 × 1 = 33. So roots could be 1 and 33. Then the product is 33. Alternatively, -1 and -33 would also give product 33. Similarly, other combinations?\n\nBut we need to check if we can have more roots whose product is still 33 or -33. For example, if we take 1, -1, 3, -11. The product would be 1 × (-1) × 3 × (-11) = 33. So that's another set. Similarly, maybe more roots?\n\nBut the more roots we take, the more numbers we need to multiply to get 33. Since 33 is 3×11, if we include 1s and -1s, we can adjust signs. But since all roots are distinct integers, we can't have repeated 1s or -1s. So let's consider different possibilities.\n\nFirst, let me think about the minimal number of roots. Since 33 is 3×11, the minimal number of roots would be two: {3, 11} or {-3, -11}, or { -3, 11}, {3, -11}, etc. But the product would be 33 or -33 depending on signs.\n\nAlternatively, if we take more roots, we can have more numbers multiplying to 33. For example, 1, -1, 3, -11 as mentioned before. Their product is 1 × (-1) × 3 × (-11) = 33. Similarly, 1, -1, -3, 11 would also give 33. Also, 1, 3, -11, -1 (same as before). Also, maybe other combinations?\n\nAnother example: 1, 1, 3, 11 but we can't have duplicate roots. So no. So need distinct integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11? The product would be 1 × (-1) × 3 × 11 = -33. So that's -33. So depending on the number of negative signs, we can get ±33.\n\nTherefore, if we take more roots, we can have more numbers whose product is ±33 by including 1s and -1s and adjusting signs accordingly. However, each time we add more roots, we have to include more numbers, but their product is still ±33. However, adding more roots may allow us to have the sum of roots be smaller in absolute value, because adding more numbers (especially small numbers like 1 and -1) might balance out the sum. Therefore, perhaps with more roots, we can get a smaller |sum|. Therefore, perhaps the minimal |a_{n-1}| occurs when we take as many roots as possible? Or maybe not? Let's check.\n\nLet me consider different cases.\n\nCase 1: Two roots. Let's take {3, 11}. Product is 33. Sum is 14. Therefore |a_{n-1}| is 2*14=28. If we take {-3, -11}, product is 33, sum is -14, absolute value same. If we take { -3, 11}, product is -33, sum is 8. Therefore |a_{n-1}| is 2*8=16. Similarly {3, -11} gives sum -8, absolute value 8, so 16. So in this case, with two roots, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 16.\n\nCase 2: Four roots. Let's take {1, -1, 3, -11}. Product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11)=33. Sum is 1 -1 + 3 -11 = -8. Absolute value 8, so |a_{n-1}| is 16. Same as above. Alternatively, {1, -1, -3, 11} would be similar: product is 1*(-1)*(-3)*11=33, sum is 1 -1 -3 +11=8, absolute value 8, same result. Alternatively, {1, -1, 11, -3} same thing. So with four roots, we can also get |sum| = 8. Therefore same |a_{n-1}| as with two roots.\n\nIs there a way to get a smaller |sum|? Let's see.\n\nCase 3: Maybe more roots. Let's try six roots. Let's think: To get product ±33, with more roots, we need to include more factors. Since 33 is 3*11, and we need to include other numbers whose product is 1 or -1. Since we can't have repeated numbers, we can include 1 and -1. For example, {1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11}. The product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3)*11*(-11) = (1*-1)*(3*-3)*(11*-11) = (-1)*( -9)*(-121) = (-1)*(1089) = -1089. That's way too big. Not 33. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe include more 1s and -1s but not their reciprocals? Wait, but we can't include reciprocals because they aren't integers. Wait, the roots have to be integers. So if we want to include more numbers, perhaps we need to include 1, -1, and other factors. Let me think.\n\nFor example, suppose we take {1, -1, 3, -3, 11}. The product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3)*11 = 99. Not 33. If we take {1, -1, 3, 11, -1}, but duplicate -1. Not allowed. So not possible. How about {1, -1, 3, 11, - something}? Let's see. Suppose we have five roots. Let me try to get product 33. Suppose we have 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number. The product so far is 1*(-1)*3*11 = -33. So to make the total product 33, we need to multiply by -1. Therefore, the fifth root should be -1. But we already have -1. Not allowed. Alternatively, if we have 1, -1, 3, 11, and -something else. Let's see. Suppose we take 1, -1, 3, 11, and x. Then product is (1)(-1)(3)(11)(x) = -33x. We want this to be 33. Therefore, -33x = 33 => x = -1. But -1 is already in the set. Not allowed. Alternatively, if we want product to be -33, then -33x = -33 => x = 1. But 1 is already in the set. So again, duplicates. Therefore, with five roots, we can't get product ±33 without duplicating 1 or -1. Therefore, five roots is not possible.\n\nHow about six roots? Let me think. Suppose we have {1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11}. As before, product is -1089. Not helpful. If we want product 33, maybe we can have more numbers? Let me think. Suppose we have {1, -1, 1, -1, 3, 11} but duplicates again. Not allowed. So maybe it's not possible to have more than four roots with product ±33? Wait, let's try another approach. Let me think of factors.\n\nSince 33 is 3×11, and 66 is 2×3×11. The divisors of 66 include 2, 6, 22, 33, 66, etc. So maybe we can use other numbers. For example, if we take 2 and 33, product is 66. Not 33. If we take 2, -1, 3, 11. Product is 2*(-1)*3*11 = -66. Not 33. If we take 2, -2, 3, 11. Product is 2*(-2)*3*11 = -132. Not helpful. How about 3, -1, 11, -1? Which we already considered. Product is 33. So that's four roots. If we want to include another number, say 1 and -1, but already included. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take fractions? But roots have to be integers. So no. Therefore, perhaps four roots is the maximum number of roots we can have with distinct integers whose product is 33? Let's see. Suppose we take {1, -1, 3, -11, something}. Wait, but adding another number would require that the product remains 33. For example, if we take 1, -1, 3, -11, and x. The product is (1)(-1)(3)(-11)x = 33x. To get 33, set 33x = 33 => x=1. But 1 is already in the set. Not allowed. Similarly, if we want product -33, 33x = -33 => x=-1, which is already in the set. Therefore, can't do that. Therefore, with five roots, not possible. Therefore, the maximum number of roots is four. So four roots is the maximum. So we have two possibilities: two roots or four roots. Both can give us |sum| = 8. But maybe there are other combinations with different numbers of roots?\n\nWait, let me check if there are other combinations with more roots. For example, suppose we take three roots. Let me see if there is a set of three distinct integers (divisors of 66) whose product is ±33. Let me think.\n\nFor example, 3, 11, 1: product is 33. So {1, 3, 11} gives product 33. The sum is 1 + 3 + 11 = 15. So |a_{n-1}| is 2*15=30. Which is worse than 16. Alternatively, { -1, -3, 11} product is (-1)(-3)(11)=33. Sum is -1 -3 +11=7. Therefore |a_{n-1}| is 2*7=14? Wait, wait. Wait, sum is 7, so |a_{n-1}| is 2*|7|=14? Wait, but earlier with two roots we had |a_{n-1}|=16. Wait, so this would be better? Wait, let me check.\n\nIf we have three roots: -1, -3, 11. Their product is (-1)*(-3)*11=33. The sum is (-1) + (-3) + 11 = 7. Therefore, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum) = -2*(7) = -14. Therefore |a_{n-1}| is 14. Which is better than 16. So that's a better value. So maybe this is a better case. Therefore, perhaps I need to check three roots as well.\n\nSo let me explore three roots. Let's see if there are other combinations.\n\nFirst, { -1, -3, 11} as above, sum 7. Similarly, { -1, -11, 3} sum is -1 -11 +3 = -9. Absolute value 9, which is worse. { -1, 3, -11} sum is -1 + 3 -11 = -9. Same. { -1, 11, -3} same. {1, -3, -11} sum is 1 -3 -11 = -13. Absolute value 13. {1, 3, -11} sum 1 +3 -11 = -7, absolute value 7. Therefore |a_{n-1}|=14. Similarly { -1, 3, 11} sum is -1 +3 +11 =13. Absolute value 13. {1, -3, 11} sum is 1 -3 +11 =9. Absolute value 9. So the best among three roots is 7 or -7, leading to |a_{n-1}|=14. That's better than the two roots case. Therefore, maybe this is the minimal so far. Let's check if there are other three-root combinations.\n\nWhat about { -1, -11, 3} as before, sum -9. Not better. How about { 1, -1, 33}? Product is 1*(-1)*33 = -33. So product is -33. Then sum is 1 -1 +33=33. Therefore |a_{n-1}|=2*|33|=66. Worse. How about { -1, 1, -33}? Product is (-1)(1)(-33)=33. Sum is -1 +1 -33= -33. |a_{n-1}|=66. Still worse. How about { 3, -1, -11}? As before, sum is 3 -1 -11 = -9. Absolute value 9. Not better. How about { 11, -1, -3} same as before. So seems like the best three-root combinations give us |sum|=7, leading to |a_{n-1}|=14. So better than two roots and four roots. So maybe this is the minimal? But let's check if there are other three-root combinations.\n\nWhat about using other divisors? For example, maybe using 2 or -2? Let me see. Let's think. Suppose we have roots that include 2. Let me see if there are three distinct integers including 2 whose product is ±33. For example, 2 * something * something else = ±33. Since 33 divided by 2 is not integer. Therefore, unless we have fractions, but roots must be integers. Therefore, if one of the roots is 2, then the product would have a factor of 2, but 33 doesn't have 2 as a factor. Therefore, product would be multiple of 2, which cannot be 33. Therefore, impossible. Similarly, if we have 2 as a root, product would be multiple of 2, but 33 is not divisible by 2, so product can't be 33. Similarly for -2. Same problem. Therefore, roots cannot include 2 or -2. Similarly for 6, 22, 33, 66? Let's check.\n\nFor example, if we take 33 as a root. Suppose we have { -1, 1, 33}. Product is -1*1*33=-33. Sum is -1 +1 +33=33. |a_{n-1}|=66. Not helpful. If we take { -1, -1, 33} but duplicates. Not allowed. Similarly, { -3, 11, 1} as before. So if we take roots that are factors of 33, like 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, then we can get products. But if we take other divisors like 2, 6, etc., they would introduce factors not in 33, making product not 33. Therefore, roots can only be from ±1, ±3, ±11. Wait, but 33 is also a divisor of 66, but including 33 would require other roots to multiply to 1 or -1. But with distinct integers.\n\nWait, for example, { -1, 1, 33} product is -33. If we take { -1, 1, -33}, product is 33. Sum is -1 +1 -33 = -33. Absolute value 33. Not helpful. So worse than 14. So seems like the only possible three-root combinations are with ±1, ±3, ±11. Therefore, the minimal |sum| with three roots is 7. So |a_{n-1}|=14.\n\nBut let me check if there are other three-root combinations. For example, { -3, -11, 1} product is (-3)(-11)(1)=33. Sum is -3 -11 +1 = -13. Absolute value 13. Which is worse than 7. Similarly { -3, 11, -1} sum is -3 +11 -1=7. So same as before. So yes, there is a combination with sum 7. Therefore, |a_{n-1}|=14. Is there a way to get even smaller |sum|?\n\nLet me check with four roots. Previously, with four roots {1, -1, 3, -11} sum is -8. So |a_{n-1}|=16. Which is worse than 14. But maybe there is another four-root combination with smaller |sum|?\n\nLet me think. For example, {1, -1, 3, -11} sum is 1 -1 +3 -11 = -8. If I take {1, -1, -3, 11} sum is 1 -1 -3 +11 = 8. Same absolute value. How about {1, -1, 11, -3} same thing. How about { -1, 1, -3, 11} same. How about other combinations?\n\nWhat if we take {1, -1, something else}? Let me think. Suppose we take {1, -1, 3, -11} as before. What if we take {1, -1, -3, -11}? Product is 1*(-1)*(-3)*(-11) = -33. So product is -33. Then sum is 1 -1 -3 -11 = -14. |a_{n-1}|=28. Worse. How about {1, -1, 3, 11}? Product is 1*(-1)*3*11=-33. Sum is 1 -1 +3 +11=14. |a_{n-1}|=28. Still worse. How about { -1, -1, 3, 11}? Duplicates. Not allowed. So no. How about {1, 1, 3, 11}? Duplicates again. Not allowed.\n\nIs there another four-root combination? Let me think. For example, using 1, -1, and two other numbers whose product is 33. Wait, but two other numbers would have to multiply to 33. But 33 can be 3×11 or -3×-11. But if we already have 1 and -1, then adding 3 and 11 would make the product 1*(-1)*3*11=-33. If we want product 33, we need to adjust signs. For example, 1, -1, -3, -11. Product is 1*(-1)*(-3)*(-11)=-33. Not helpful. If we take 1, -1, -3, 11. Product is 1*(-1)*(-3)*11=33. Sum is 1 -1 -3 +11=8. Which we already considered. So seems like the minimal with four roots is 8, leading to |a_{n-1}|=16. Which is worse than 14 from three roots.\n\nHow about with five roots? Earlier thought it's not possible, but let me try again. Suppose we take 1, -1, 3, -3, and something. The product would be 1*(-1)*3*(-3)*x = 9x. We need 9x = ±33. Therefore x = ±33/9 = ±11/3. Not integer. Not allowed. Similarly, if we take 1, -1, 11, -11, x. Product is 1*(-1)*11*(-11)*x = 121x. Set equal to ±33. x = ±33/121. Not integer. Not helpful. How about 1, -1, 3, 11, x. Product is 1*(-1)*3*11*x = -33x. Set equal to 33: -33x=33 => x=-1. But -1 is already in the set. Not allowed. Similarly, set equal to -33: -33x=-33 => x=1. Already in set. Not allowed. Therefore, five roots not possible.\n\nHow about six roots? Let me think. For example, 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11. Product is (1*-1)*(3*-3)*(11*-11) = (-1)*(-9)*(-121) = -1089. Not helpful. If I want product ±33, need to have factors. But with so many numbers, it's going to be too big. So no.\n\nTherefore, seems like the minimal |sum| is 7 with three roots, leading to |a_{n-1}|=14. But let me check if there are other three-root combinations with smaller |sum|.\n\nLet me think. For example, can I have roots whose product is 33 and sum is smaller? Let's see. For example, { -1, 3, 11} sum is -1 + 3 + 11 = 13. { -1, -3, 11} sum is -1 -3 +11 = 7. { -1, -11, 3} sum is -1 -11 +3 = -9. { -1, 11, -3} same as above. { 1, -3, 11} sum is 1 -3 +11=9. { 1, 3, -11} sum is 1 +3 -11=-7. Absolute value 7. { 1, -11, -3} sum is 1 -11 -3=-13. { -3, -11, -1} sum is -3 -11 -1=-15. { 3, 11, -1} same as before. So the minimal |sum| with three roots is 7. Therefore, |a_{n-1}|=14.\n\nIs there a way to get even smaller |sum|? Let's think. For example, with more roots. Wait, with four roots, the minimal |sum| is 8. So worse. How about with five or more roots? Not possible as discussed. So maybe 14 is the minimal. But let me check if there are other three-root combinations. For example, using 1, -1, and something else? Wait, but with three roots, we need product ±33. For example, if we take { -1, 1, -33} product is (-1)(1)(-33)=33. Sum is -1 +1 -33=-33. Absolute value 33. Not helpful. Similarly {1, -1, 33} sum is 1 -1 +33=33. Same. How about { -1, 33, something}? For example, { -1, 33, x} product is -33x. To get 33, need -33x=33 => x=-1. Already there. Not allowed. So no. How about { -3, 11, x}? Product is -3*11*x = -33x. To get 33, need -33x=33 => x=-1. So { -3, 11, -1} which we already considered. Sum is -3 +11 -1=7. Same as before. Similarly for other combinations. So no improvement.\n\nTherefore, seems like 14 is the minimal. But let me check if there are other three roots with different numbers. For example, can we have roots like  -1,  something, something else?\n\nWait, what about using 1, -1, and 33? No, already checked. How about using  -1, -3, -11? Product is (-1)(-3)(-11)= -33. So product is -33. If we want product 33, we need to adjust. Let me think. If we take { -1, -3, -11} product -33. If we take another root? But we can't. Because with three roots. If we take { -1, -3, -11, ...} but four roots. But with three roots, product is -33. If we want to have product 33, we need to have an even number of negative numbers. For example, { -1, -3, 11} has two negatives, product positive 33. Similarly { -1, 3, -11} same. So that's the case we already considered.\n\nIs there a way to have more balanced roots? For example, roots that cancel each other more? For example, if we have both 1 and -1, and 3 and -3, but that would require more roots. But with four roots, as we saw, the sum is ±8. Which is worse than 7. So no.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose I take roots { -3, -1, 1, 11}. Product is (-3)(-1)(1)(11)=33. Sum is -3 -1 +1 +11=8. Which is same as before. So no improvement.\n\nAlternatively, { -3, -1, -1, 11} but duplicate -1. Not allowed. How about { -3, 1, 1, 11}? Duplicate 1. Not allowed. How about { -3, -1, 2, something}? But 2 is not allowed because product would have factor 2. As discussed earlier.\n\nTherefore, no. So seems like 7 is the minimal |sum| for three roots. Therefore |a_{n-1}|=14. Is there a way to get |sum| smaller than 7? Let's think. For example, can we have sum 0? If sum is 0, then |a_{n-1}|=0. Which would be ideal. But is that possible?\n\nTo have sum of roots equal to 0, we need the roots to add up to zero. Let's see if that's possible with product ±33. Let's try. For example, with four roots. Let me try to find four distinct integers whose product is 33 and sum is 0. For example, { a, b, c, d} with a + b + c + d = 0 and a*b*c*d=33. Since 33 factors into 1, -1, 3, -11. Let's check: 1 + (-1) + 3 + (-11) = -8 ≠ 0. How about adding another pair? For example, if we take 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11... but that's six roots. Their sum would be 0, but product is -1089. Not helpful. How about with four roots? Let's think. Suppose we take 1, -1, something, something else. Let me try.\n\nLet me think of two pairs of numbers that multiply to 33 and -1. For example, if I have two numbers multiplying to 33 and two numbers multiplying to -1. But two numbers multiplying to -1 are 1 and -1. So then the four numbers would be 1, -1, and two numbers multiplying to 33. For example, 1, -1, 3, 11. Their sum is 1 -1 +3 +11=14 ≠ 0. If I take 1, -1, -3, -11. Sum is 1 -1 -3 -11=-14 ≠ 0. If I take 1, -1, 3, -11. Sum is 1 -1 +3 -11=-8 ≠ 0. How about if I take other numbers? For example, 1, -1,  something, something else. Suppose I want the sum to be zero. Let me denote the four numbers as a, b, c, d. Suppose two of them are 1 and -1. Then c + d = - (1 -1) = 0. Therefore, c + d = 0, and c*d = 33 / (1*(-1)) = -33. Therefore, c and d are roots of x² - 0x -33 = 0. Which are x = [0 ± sqrt(0 + 132)]/2 = ±sqrt(33). Not integers. Therefore impossible. Therefore, can't have such c and d. Therefore, if we take 1 and -1, can't get sum zero. How about if we don't take 1 and -1? Suppose we take other numbers. For example, four numbers a, b, c, d with product 33 and sum zero. Since 33 is positive, there must be even number of negative numbers. Let me think. Let's try to have two negative numbers and two positive numbers. Let me try.\n\nSuppose we have two positive numbers and two negative numbers. Let me think. Let me try with 3, 11, -something, -something else. Let me think. Let me denote them as 3, 11, -a, -b, where a and b are positive integers. Then the product is 3*11*(-a)*(-b) = 33ab. We need this to be 33. Therefore, 33ab = 33 => ab=1. Since a and b are positive integers, the only solution is a=1, b=1. Therefore, roots are 3, 11, -1, -1. But duplicate -1. Not allowed. Therefore impossible. Similarly, if we take other positive numbers. For example, 1, 33, -a, -b. Product is 1*33*(-a)*(-b)=33ab. Set equal to 33. Therefore ab=1. Again, same problem. Therefore roots would be 1, 33, -1, -1. Duplicates again. Not allowed.\n\nHow about three positive numbers and one negative? Then product would be negative. So to get product 33, need odd number of negative numbers. So if we have one negative and three positive. Let me try. Let me take -x, a, b, c. Product is -x*a*b*c = 33. So x*a*b*c = -33. Since x, a, b, c are positive integers. Let me think. Let me take x, a, b, c such that their product is 33. Since 33 factors as 1×3×11. So if we have four numbers multiplying to 33, they must include 1, 1, 3, 11 but duplicates. Not allowed. Therefore impossible. Therefore, can't have four distinct positive integers multiplying to 33. Therefore, no solution here.\n\nAlternatively, if we take more factors. For example, 1×1×3×11, but duplicates. Not allowed. So no. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, there is no four roots set with product 33 and sum zero.\n\nHow about with five roots? Let me think. For example, with five roots, maybe some positive and some negative numbers that cancel out. But as discussed earlier, with five roots, it's hard to get product 33. Let me try. Suppose we have five roots: a, b, c, d, e. Their product is 33. Since 33 is 3×11, we need to have factors 3 and 11, and other numbers multiplying to 1. For example, including 1, -1, 1, -1, 3, 11... but duplicates. Not allowed. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, no.\n\nHow about with six roots? Same problem. Including multiple 1s and -1s, but duplicates. Not allowed. Therefore, no. Therefore, it's impossible to have roots summing to zero. Therefore, the minimal |sum| is 7. Therefore, |a_{n-1}|=14.\n\nBut let me check another thing. What if we take more roots, but with product -33? For example, if the product is -33, then depending on the degree n, the constant term a_0 is 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots). Since a_0 is 66, then 66 = 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots). Therefore, product of roots = 66 / 2 * (-1)^n = 33*(-1)^n. Therefore, if n is even, product of roots is 33. If n is odd, product is -33. Therefore, depending on the number of roots (the degree n), the product is ±33. Therefore, if we take a set of roots with product -33, that's allowed if n is odd. So maybe there are other combinations where product is -33, which might give us a smaller |sum|?\n\nLet me check. For example, with three roots, product -33. Let's see. For example, { -1, 1, -33} product is (-1)(1)(-33)=33. Not -33. If we want product -33, need odd number of negative numbers. For example, { -1, 1, 33} product is (-1)(1)(33)=-33. Sum is -1 +1 +33=33. |a_{n-1}|=66. Not helpful. { -1, -3, -11} product is (-1)(-3)(-11)=-33. Sum is -1 -3 -11=-15. |a_{n-1}|=30. Worse than 14. { -1, 3, 11} product is (-1)(3)(11)=-33. Sum is -1 +3 +11=13. |a_{n-1}|=26. Worse than 14. { 1, -3, -11} product is 1*(-3)*(-11)=33. Not -33. { 1, 3, -11} product is 1*3*(-11)=-33. Sum is 1 +3 -11=-7. |a_{n-1}|=14. Same as before. So same value. Therefore, whether product is 33 or -33, we can get |sum|=7 or |-7|=7. Therefore, same result. Therefore, no improvement.\n\nSimilarly, with four roots, product -33. Let me check. For example, {1, -1, 3, 11} product is -33. Sum is 1 -1 +3 +11=14. |a_{n-1}|=28. Worse. { -1, -1, 3, 11} duplicates. Not allowed. { -1, 1, -3, 11} product is (-1)(1)(-3)(11)=33. Not -33. { -1, 1, 3, -11} product is (-1)(1)(3)(-11)=33. Not -33. How about { -1, -3, 1, 11} product is (-1)(-3)(1)(11)=33. Not -33. { -1, -3, -1, 11} duplicates. Not allowed. How about { -1, 3, 11, x} with product -33. Let me think. Suppose four roots: -1, 3, 11, x. Product is (-1)(3)(11)(x) = -33x. Set equal to -33: -33x = -33 => x=1. So roots are -1, 3, 11, 1. Sum is -1 +3 +11 +1=14. Same as before. Therefore, no improvement.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the minimal |sum| is 7, leading to |a_{n-1}|=14. Therefore, the answer should be 14. But let me check once more if there are other combinations I haven't considered.\n\nWait, let me think about using more numbers. For example, with five roots, even though earlier I thought it's not possible, but maybe with some other numbers?\n\nWait, suppose we take 1, -1, 3, -3, 11. Product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3)*11 = 99. Not 33. If we take 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, and another root? No, five roots. How about 1, -1, 3, -3, 11 divided by something? No, roots have to be integers. Not helpful. How about taking 1, -1, 3, -1, 11? Duplicate -1. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using 1, -1,  something else. But seems no. Therefore, no.\n\nAnother thought: What if the polynomial has more than three roots? For example, if we take roots that include 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, but as discussed earlier, the product is way too big. But maybe if we take some of them?\n\nWait, for example, { -1, 1, 3, -3, 11} product is (-1)(1)(3)(-3)(11)= 99. Not 33. If we take { -1, 1, 3, -11} product is (-1)(1)(3)(-11)=33. Which is four roots, sum is -1 +1 +3 -11=-8. Which we already considered. So no improvement.\n\nTherefore, seems like there is no way to get a smaller |sum| than 7. Therefore, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 14. Therefore, the answer is 14. But let me check once again with another approach.\n\nLet me think about Vieta's formula again. The polynomial is 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rk). The constant term is 2*(-1)^k*(r1*r2*...*rk) = 66. Therefore, (-1)^k*(r1*r2*...*rk) = 33. Therefore, product of roots is 33 if k is even, -33 if k is odd. So for example, if we take three roots (k=3, odd), product is -33. Wait, no. Wait:\n\nWait, 2*(-1)^k*(product) = 66 => (-1)^k*(product) = 33. Therefore, if k is even, then product = 33. If k is odd, product = -33. So for example, if we take three roots (k=3 odd), then product of roots is -33. So to get product -33 with three roots. For example, { -1, 3, 11} product is -33. Sum is -1 +3 +11=13. |a_{n-1}|=2*13=26. But earlier we had { -1, -3, 11} product is 33 (for k even?), wait no:\n\nWait, if k is even, product is 33. If k is odd, product is -33. So if we take three roots (k=3 odd), product of roots is -33. Therefore, { -1, -3, 11} product is (-1)(-3)(11)=33. Which would require that (-1)^k * product = 33. Since k=3, (-1)^3 * product = -product = 33 => product = -33. But (-1)(-3)(11)=33. Therefore, -product = 33 => product = -33. Contradiction. Wait, something is wrong here.\n\nWait let me recast:\n\nGiven that 2*(-1)^k*(product of roots) = 66 => (-1)^k*(product of roots) = 33. Therefore, if k is even, product of roots is 33. If k is odd, product of roots is -33. Therefore, if I take three roots (k=3 odd), product of roots must be -33. Therefore, { -1, -3, 11} product is 33. Which is not equal to -33. Therefore, invalid. Therefore, in order to have product of roots = -33 with three roots, we need three numbers multiplying to -33. For example, { -1, 3, 11} product is -1*3*11=-33. Therefore, this is valid. Then the sum is -1 +3 +11=13. Therefore, |a_{n-1}|=2*13=26. But earlier I thought that { -1, -3, 11} gives product 33 and with k even (k=3 is odd, so invalid). Wait, confusion here.\n\nEarlier, I considered { -1, -3, 11} with product 33. If that set is used, then we must have k even. But if k is even, how many roots? For example, four roots. Let me take { -1, -3, 11, 1} product is (-1)(-3)(11)(1)=33. Which is valid for k=4 even. Then sum is -1 -3 +11 +1=8. Which gives |a_{n-1}|=16. But earlier I also considered { -1, -3, 11} with product 33, but that would require k odd, which would mean product should be -33, but it's 33. Therefore, invalid. Therefore, my previous consideration of { -1, -3, 11} was actually for k=3 which is invalid. Wait, but earlier I thought that { -1, -3, 11} gives product 33 and sum -1 -3 +11=7. But if k=3, then product should be -33. Therefore, this set is invalid for k=3. Therefore, my previous reasoning was flawed. Wait, this is critical.\n\nSo let me correct that. If I take three roots { -1, -3, 11}, product is 33. But since k=3 is odd, the formula says that (-1)^3 * product = -product = 33 => product = -33. Therefore, this set { -1, -3, 11} has product 33, which doesn't satisfy the equation. Therefore, invalid. Therefore, such a set cannot be used for a polynomial of degree 3. Therefore, my previous consideration was wrong. Therefore, need to correct that.\n\nSo what's the correct approach? Let me re-express.\n\nIf we have a set of roots with product P, then depending on the degree k (number of roots), we must have:\n\nIf k is even: P = 33\n\nIf k is odd: P = -33\n\nTherefore, when I considered three roots { -1, -3, 11} with product 33, since k=3 is odd, this would require P=-33, but actual P=33. Therefore, invalid. Therefore, such a set cannot be used. Therefore, my previous calculation where I thought that { -1, -3, 11} gives |a_{n-1}|=14 was wrong. It is actually invalid. Therefore, need to find sets of roots with product 33 if k even, or -33 if k odd.\n\nTherefore, let's re-examine.\n\nCase 1: Two roots (k=2 even). Product must be 33. Possible sets: {3, 11}, {-3, -11}, { -3, 11}, {3, -11}. Their sums are 14, -14, 8, -8. Therefore |a_{n-1}|=2*|sum|=28 or 16. So minimal is 16.\n\nCase 2: Three roots (k=3 odd). Product must be -33. Possible sets: For example, { -1, 3, 11} product is -33. Sum is -1 +3 +11=13. |a_{n-1}|=26. Another example: {1, -3, 11} product is 1*(-3)*11=-33. Sum is 1 -3 +11=9. |a_{n-1}|=18. Another example: {1, 3, -11} same as above. { -1, -3, -11} product is (-1)(-3)(-11)=-33. Sum is -15. |a_{n-1}|=30. { -1, -1, 33} invalid due to duplicates. { -1, 1, -33} product is (-1)(1)(-33)=33. Not -33. Not valid. Therefore, the minimal |sum| for three roots is 9, leading to |a_{n-1}|=18.\n\nCase 3: Four roots (k=4 even). Product must be 33. Possible sets: {1, -1, 3, -11} product is 33. Sum is -8. |a_{n-1}|=16. { -1, 1, -3, 11} same. {1, -1, -3, 11} sum is 8. Same |a_{n-1}|. Therefore minimal is 16.\n\nCase 4: Five roots (k=5 odd). Product must be -33. Let me see if possible. For example, {1, -1, 1, -1, 33} duplicates. Not allowed. {1, -1, 3, -1, 11} duplicates. Not allowed. {1, -1, 3, -3, 11} product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3)*11=99. Not -33. {1, -1, 3, -11, x} product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*x=33x. Set equal to -33: 33x=-33 => x=-1. But -1 is already present. Duplicates. Not allowed. Therefore, no valid sets with five roots.\n\nCase 5: Six roots (k=6 even). Product must be 33. Similar issues as five roots. Not possible without duplicates.\n\nTherefore, correcting my previous mistake, the valid cases are:\n\n- Two roots: |a_{n-1}|=16 or 28.\n\n- Three roots: |a_{n-1}|=18, 26, 30, etc.\n\n- Four roots: |a_{n-1}|=16.\n\nTherefore, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 16. Which occurs both with two roots (e.g., { -3, 11} with product -33 for k=2 odd? Wait, no. Wait, need to check consistency again.\n\nWait, for two roots (k=2 even). Product must be 33. So { -3, -11} product is 33. Sum is -14. |a_{n-1}|=2*14=28. Or {3, 11} sum 14, same. Or { -3, 11} product is -33. But since k=2 is even, product must be 33. Therefore, { -3, 11} is invalid. Therefore, only {3,11}, {-3,-11}, { -1, -33}, {1, 33} etc. For example, { -1, -33} product is 33. Sum is -34. |a_{n-1}|=68. Worse. Therefore, minimal for two roots is 16 from { -3, 11}? Wait no, { -3, 11} product is -33. Since k=2 is even, product should be 33. Therefore, invalid. Therefore, only valid two-root sets are those with product 33. Which are {3,11}, {-3,-11}, {1,33}, {-1,-33}, { -1, -3*11} etc. So {3,11} sum 14, leading to |a_{n-1}|=28. {-3,-11} sum -14, same. {1, 33} sum 34, leading to 68. So minimal for two roots is 28. But earlier I thought there was a case with |a_{n-1}|=16, but that was invalid. Wait, where did that come from?\n\nEarlier I considered { -3, 11} with product -33 and thought it was valid for k=2. But since k=2 is even, product should be 33. Therefore, { -3, 11} is invalid. Therefore, my previous conclusion that with two roots we can have |a_{n-1}|=16 was wrong. It was based on an invalid set. Therefore, correcting that, the valid two-root cases give |a_{n-1}|=28 or higher. Then the four-root case {1, -1, 3, -11} gives product 33 (k=4 even), sum -8, so |a_{n-1}|=16. Which is valid. Therefore, this is better. Also, three-root cases give |a_{n-1}|=18 or higher. Therefore, the minimal is 16.\n\nBut wait, let me check the four-root case again. The set {1, -1, 3, -11} has product 1*(-1)*3*(-11)=33. Since k=4 is even, this is valid. Sum is 1 -1 + 3 -11 = -8. Therefore, a_{n-1} = -2*(-8) = 16? Wait, no. Wait Vieta's formula says sum of roots = -a_{n-1}/a_n. Here, a_n=2, so sum of roots = -a_{n-1}/2 => a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, sum of roots is -8. Therefore, a_{n-1} = -2*(-8)=16. Therefore, |a_{n-1}|=16. Correct. Therefore, this is valid.\n\nSimilarly, { -1, 1, -3, 11} same thing. Sum is -1 +1 -3 +11=8. Therefore, a_{n-1}=-2*(8)=-16. Absolute value 16. Same.\n\nTherefore, this is valid. Therefore, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 16.\n\nBut earlier I thought there was a three-root case with |a_{n-1}|=14, but that was invalid because the product didn't satisfy the required condition based on the degree. Therefore, correcting that, the minimal is 16.\n\nIs there another four-root combination with smaller |sum|? For example, {1, -1, -3, 11} sum is 1 -1 -3 +11=8. Absolute value 8. Which gives |a_{n-1}|=16. If we can find a four-root combination with smaller |sum|, say 7, then |a_{n-1}|=14. But is that possible?\n\nLet me try. For example, can we have four distinct integers with product 33 and sum ±7? Let me try. Let me think of numbers that could add up to 7 or -7.\n\nLet me think of small numbers. For example, 1, -1, 3, and something. Let me compute 1 + (-1) + 3 + x = 7 => x=7 - (1 -1 +3)=7 -3=4. So x=4. Is 4 a divisor of 66? Yes, 66 divided by 4 is not integer, but 4 is a divisor? Wait, 4 does not divide 66. 66 divided by 4 is 16.5. Therefore, 4 is not a divisor of 66. Therefore, cannot have 4 as a root. Therefore, invalid.\n\nHow about 1 + (-1) + something + something else = 7? Let me think. For example, 1 + (-1) + 2 + 5=7. But 2 and 5 are not divisors of 66. 5 isn't a divisor. So no.\n\nHow about 1 + (-1) + 6 + 1=7. But duplicate 1. Not allowed.\n\nHow about 2 + (-2) + 3 + 4=7. But 2, -2, 4 are not divisors of 66? 2 is a divisor, but 4 isn't. So no.\n\nHow about using 1, -1, and two other numbers whose product is 33/(1*(-1))= -33. So the two other numbers multiply to -33. Let me think. For example, 3 and -11. Then the four numbers are 1, -1, 3, -11. Which we already have. Their sum is -8. If I want sum 7, need different numbers. For example, let me think of two numbers multiplying to -33. For example, -3 and 11. Then four numbers are 1, -1, -3, 11. Their sum is 1 -1 -3 +11=8. Which is what we have. If I want sum 7, need to adjust. Let me think. Suppose instead of 1 and -1, use other numbers. For example, let me take two numbers multiplying to 1 (so that the other two multiply to 33). For example, 1 and 1, but duplicates. Not allowed. How about -1 and -1? Duplicates. Not allowed. Therefore, no.\n\nAlternatively, take numbers multiplying to something else. For example, if I have four numbers a, b, c, d with product 33 and sum 7. Since 33 is small, it's hard to have four numbers. Let me think of factors. Since 33 is 3×11, and we need four distinct integers. Let me think. For example, 1, -1, 3, 11. Product is -33. Not 33. If I take 1, -1, -3, -11. Product is 33. Sum is 1 -1 -3 -11=-14. No. How about 1, 1, 3, 11. Duplicates. Not allowed. How about 1, -1, 3, -11. Product 33. Sum -8. How about 1, -1, -3, 11. Product 33. Sum 8. How about -1, -1, 3, 11. Duplicates. How about 1, 3, -1, -something? Wait, already considered. It seems impossible to get sum 7 with four roots. Therefore, the minimal |sum| with four roots is 8, leading to |a_{n-1}|=16.\n\nTherefore, after correcting my earlier mistake, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 16.\n\nBut let me check if there are other four-root combinations. For example, using 1, -1, and other numbers. Suppose I take 1, -1, something, something else. For example, 1, -1,  something, something else. Let me try to find another set. Suppose I take 1, -1,  something, something else such that product is 33. For example, 1, -1,  something, something else. The product of something and something else must be 33 / (1*(-1)) = -33. Therefore, same as before. So need two numbers multiplying to -33. Which are (1, -33), (-1, 33), (3, -11), (-3, 11). But 33 and -33 are divisors of 66. Let me try:\n\nSet 1: 1, -1, 1, -33. Duplicates. Not allowed.\n\nSet 2: 1, -1, -1, 33. Duplicates. Not allowed.\n\nSet 3: 1, -1, 3, -11. Valid. Sum -8.\n\nSet 4: 1, -1, -3, 11. Valid. Sum 8.\n\nTherefore, no other combinations. Therefore, no improvement.\n\nTherefore, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 16.\n\nIs there another case with more roots? For example, six roots? Let me think. Suppose I take 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11. Product is (1*-1)*(3*-3)*(11*-11) = (-1)*(-9)*(-121) = -1089. To get product 33, need (-1)^k * product = 33. For k=6 even, product should be 33. But here it's -1089. Not helpful. How about adding more 1s and -1s? Not allowed due to duplicates. Therefore, no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is 16.\n\nBut let me check another four-root combination. For example, { -1, 1,  something, something} with product 33. For example, { -1, 1, -3, -11} product is (-1)(1)(-3)(-11)= -33. Not 33. Not valid. { -1, 1, 3, -11} product is 33. Sum is -1 +1 +3 -11=-8. Same as before. Valid. Therefore, same result.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 16.\n\nBut let me check if there are other four-root combinations with different numbers. For example, using 2 or other divisors. Wait, earlier we saw that if we include 2, the product would have factor 2, which 33 doesn't have. For example, { 2, something, something, something} product would have factor 2, but 33 is not divisible by 2. Therefore, impossible. Similarly for other divisors like 6, 22, etc. Therefore, no.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 16.\n\nBut let me check once more with Vieta's formula for the four-root case.\n\nLet me take the polynomial with roots 1, -1, 3, -11. Then the polynomial is 2*(x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 3)(x + 11). Let me compute the coefficient a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, expand (x - 1)(x + 1) = x² - 1.\n\nThen expand (x - 3)(x + 11) = x² + 8x - 33.\n\nNow multiply these two quadratics: (x² - 1)(x² + 8x - 33) = x²(x² + 8x - 33) - 1*(x² + 8x - 33) = x⁴ + 8x³ - 33x² - x² - 8x + 33 = x⁴ + 8x³ - 34x² - 8x + 33.\n\nThen multiply by 2: 2x⁴ + 16x³ - 68x² - 16x + 66.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients are a_4=2, a_3=16, a_2=-68, a_1=-16, a_0=66. Therefore, |a_{n-1}|=|16|=16. Correct. Therefore, this polynomial satisfies the conditions, and |a_{n-1}|=16.\n\nIs there a polynomial with smaller |a_{n-1}|? For example, with |a_{n-1}|=14? Earlier thought there was, but it was invalid. Let me check with the corrected understanding.\n\nSuppose someone claims that with three roots {-1, -3, 11}, product 33, but since k=3 is odd, product should be -33. Therefore, invalid. Therefore, cannot use it. Therefore, no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible |a_{n-1}| is 16.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{16}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{16}\n</think>"}
