Hmm, let me start by recalling what balancing equations means. It means making sure that the number of each type of atom is the same on both sides of the equation. Right, so I need to count the atoms on each side and adjust the coefficients accordingly.\n\nFirst, let me write down the unbalanced equation again to visualize it better:\n\nH3PO4 + KOH → H2O + K3PO4\n\nNow, let me list out the elements involved here. There's hydrogen (H), phosphorus (P), oxygen (O), and potassium (K). Let's count each element on both the reactant and product sides.\n\nStarting with the left side (reactants):\n\n- H3PO4 has 3 H, 1 P, 4 O.\n- KOH has 1 K, 1 O, 1 H.\nSo combining them, the total atoms on the left would be:\nHydrogen: 3 (from H3PO4) + 1 (from KOH) = 4 H\nPhosphorus: 1 (from H3PO4)\nOxygen: 4 (from H3PO4) + 1 (from KOH) = 5 O\nPotassium: 1 (from KOH)\n\nNow the right side (products):\n\n- H2O has 2 H and 1 O.\n- K3PO4 has 3 K, 1 P, 4 O.\nTotal atoms on the right:\nHydrogen: 2 (from H2O)\nPhosphorus: 1 (from K3PO4)\nOxygen: 1 (from H2O) + 4 (from K3PO4) = 5 O\nPotassium: 3 (from K3PO4)\n\nComparing both sides:\n\nHydrogen: Left has 4, right has 2 → needs more on the right.\nPhosphorus: Both have 1 → balanced.\nOxygen: Both have 5 → balanced.\nPotassium: Left has 1, right has 3 → needs more on the left.\n\nSo the main imbalances are hydrogen and potassium. Let's tackle potassium first. On the left, there's 1 K in KOH, and on the right, there's 3 K in K3PO4. To balance potassium, I need 3 KOH on the left. Let me adjust that:\n\nH3PO4 + 3KOH → H2O + K3PO4\n\nNow, let's recount the atoms with this adjustment.\n\nLeft side:\n\n- H3PO4: 3 H, 1 P, 4 O\n- 3KOH: 3 K, 3 O, 3 H\nTotal:\nHydrogen: 3 + 3 = 6 H\nPhosphorus: 1\nOxygen: 4 + 3 = 7 O\nPotassium: 3\n\nRight side:\n\n- H2O: 2 H, 1 O\n- K3PO4: 3 K, 1 P, 4 O\nTotal:\nHydrogen: 2\nPhosphorus: 1\nOxygen: 1 + 4 = 5 O\nPotassium: 3\n\nNow, potassium is balanced (3 each side). Next, hydrogen. Left has 6 H, right has 2 H. To balance hydrogen, I need to get 6 H on the right. Since each H2O has 2 H, I need 3 H2O molecules to get 6 H. Let me adjust that:\n\nH3PO4 + 3KOH → 3H2O + K3PO4\n\nNow, let's check all elements again.\n\nLeft side:\n\n- H3PO4: 3 H, 1 P, 4 O\n- 3KOH: 3 K, 3 O, 3 H\nTotal:\nHydrogen: 3 + 3 = 6 H\nPhosphorus: 1\nOxygen: 4 + 3 = 7 O\nPotassium: 3\n\nRight side:\n\n- 3H2O: 6 H, 3 O\n- K3PO4: 3 K, 1 P, 4 O\nTotal:\nHydrogen: 6 H\nPhosphorus: 1\nOxygen: 3 + 4 = 7 O\nPotassium: 3\n\nNow checking each element:\n\nHydrogen: 6 on both sides → balanced.\nPhosphorus: 1 each → balanced.\nOxygen: 7 on both sides (left 4+3=7, right 3+4=7) → balanced.\nPotassium: 3 each → balanced.\n\nLooks like everything is balanced now. Let me just verify once more to be sure.\n\nOriginal equation after balancing:\n\nH3PO4 + 3KOH → 3H2O + K3PO4\n\nYes, all elements are balanced. So the balanced equation requires 1 H3PO4, 3 KOH, producing 3 H2O and 1 K3PO4. The coefficients are 1, 3, 3, and 1 respectively. Since the coefficient of 1 is typically omitted in chemical equations, the balanced equation would be written as:\n\nH3PO4 + 3KOH → 3H2O + K3PO4\n\nI think that's it. Let me just cross-verify once more with another method, maybe using algebraic equations.\n\nLet me assign variables to each coefficient:\n\nLet a be the coefficient for H3PO4,\nb for KOH,\nc for H2O,\nd for K3PO4.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\na H3PO4 + b KOH → c H2O + d K3PO4\n\nNow, write the equations based on each element:\n\nFor H: 3a + 1b = 2c + 0d\nFor P: 1a + 0b = 0c + 1d → a = d\nFor O: 4a + 1b = 1c + 4d\nFor K: 0a + 1b = 0c + 3d → b = 3d\n\nSo we have these equations:\n\n1. 3a + b = 2c\n2. a = d\n3. 4a + b = c + 4d\n4. b = 3d\n\nSince a = d (from equation 2), and b = 3d (from equation 4), let's substitute d = a into equation 4: b = 3a.\n\nNow substitute a = d and b = 3a into equation 3:\n\n4a + 3a = c + 4a → 7a = c + 4a → c = 7a - 4a = 3a\n\nSo c = 3a.\n\nNow substitute into equation 1:\n\n3a + 3a = 2c → 6a = 2c → c = 3a, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo all variables are in terms of a. Let's set a = 1 (simplest whole number):\n\na = 1\nd = 1\nb = 3*1 = 3\nc = 3*1 = 3\n\nSo the coefficients are 1, 3, 3, 1. Therefore, the balanced equation is:\n\nH3PO4 + 3KOH → 3H2O + K3PO4\n\nYes, this matches what I found earlier. So the balanced equation is correct.\n</think>"}
