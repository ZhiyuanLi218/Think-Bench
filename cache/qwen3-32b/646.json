The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. The options are four different compounds: A is 2-methyl-3-pentenal, B is 3-methyl-3-penten-2-ol, C is 3-methyl-3-pentenal, D is 3-methyl-3-penten-2-one. \n\nFirst, the molecular ion peak in the mass spectrum is at m/z 98. So, the molecular weight of the compound is 98. Let me check the molecular formulas of each option to see which one has a molecular weight of 98.\n\nLet me recall the molecular formulas. Let's break down each compound.\n\nOption A: 2-methyl-3-pentenal. The name suggests a pentenal (so five carbons with a double bond in the aldehyde group, maybe at position 3?), and a methyl group at position 2. The formula for pentenal is C5H8O. Adding a methyl group would add a CH3, so maybe the formula is C6H10O? Wait, maybe I need to draw the structure. Let's think: pentanal is C5H10O. If it's pentenal, maybe it's a conjugated system? Wait, pentenal might be a five-carbon chain with a double bond and an aldehyde group. For example, 2-pentenal would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CHO? But the position of the double bond and the aldehyde group affects the formula. Let me check each option's molecular formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the molecular weights. Let's see:\n\nFor each option, let me figure out the molecular formula and calculate the molecular weight.\n\nOption A: 2-methyl-3-pentenal. Let's see: pentenal is C5H8O? Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the structure. Let me try to draw it. The parent chain is pentenal. The aldehyde group is at position 1. If there's a double bond at position 3, then the structure would be CH2CH2CH=CHCHO? But with a methyl group at position 2. So the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH=CHCHO? Wait, maybe. Let me count the carbon atoms. The parent chain is pentanal (5 carbons with an aldehyde group at position 1). If there's a double bond at position 3 and a methyl group at position 2, then the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO? So that's 5 carbons in the main chain, with a methyl branch at position 2, a double bond between 3 and 4, and an aldehyde group at position 1. The molecular formula would be C6H10O? Let me count: 6 carbons (5 in the main chain plus one methyl branch), 10 hydrogens. Let's check: the aldehyde group is CHO, so for each carbon, the hydrogen count depends on the structure. Alternatively, maybe I can use degrees of unsaturation. Each double bond and ring counts as one degree of unsaturation. The molecular formula can be determined by molecular weight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate molecular weights for each option.\n\nLet me list all options:\n\nA: 2-methyl-3-pentenal\n\nB: 3-methyl-3-penten-2-ol\n\nC: 3-methyl-3-pentenal\n\nD: 3-methyl-3-penten-2-one\n\nLet me try to figure out their molecular formulas.\n\nStarting with option D: 3-methyl-3-penten-2-one. The parent chain is penten-2-one, so a five-carbon chain with a ketone group at position 2 and a double bond at position 3. The structure would be CH2C(CH3)=CHCOCH3? Wait, let me think. The ketone is at position 2 (so the carbonyl group is on carbon 2), and the double bond is at position 3 (so between carbons 3 and 4). The parent chain is penten-2-one, so the structure would be CH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCOCH3? Wait, maybe I need to break it down.\n\nWait, penten-2-one is a five-carbon chain with a ketone at position 2 and a double bond. The position of the double bond is 3, so the structure would be CH2CH2C=CHCOCH3? Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me approach this differently.\n\nFor each compound, let's find the molecular formula and then calculate the molecular weight.\n\nOption A: 2-methyl-3-pentenal. The parent chain is pentenal, which is a five-carbon aldehyde with a double bond. The aldehyde group is at position 1, and the double bond at position 3. The methyl group is at position 2. The structure would be CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO. Let's count the atoms:\n\nCarbon: 6 (5 in the main chain + 1 methyl group)\nHydrogen: Let's see. The aldehyde group has one hydrogen (CHO), but the rest depends on the structure. Alternatively, use the formula for alkenes and aldehydes. For a five-carbon aldehyde with a double bond, the formula would be C5H8O (since an aldehyde has one oxygen and one double bond, and a five-carbon aldehyde would be C5H10O, but with a double bond, it would be C5H8O). Adding a methyl group would add a CH3, so total formula becomes C6H10O. Molecular weight is 6*12 + 10*1 + 16 = 72 +10 +16=98. So that's 98. So option A has molecular weight 98. That matches the mass spec data.\n\nOption B: 3-methyl-3-penten-2-ol. The parent chain is penten-2-ol, which is a five-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group at position 2 and a double bond at position 3. The structure would be CH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCH2OH? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The hydroxyl group is at position 2, so the structure would be CH2CH(OH)-CH(CH3)=CH2? Not sure. The formula would be C5H10O for penten-2-ol (since it's an alcohol with a double bond). Adding a methyl group at position 3 would make it C6H12O. Molecular weight would be 6*12 + 12*1 + 16 = 72+12+16=100. So 100, which doesn't match the 98 from the mass spec. So option B is out.\n\nOption C: 3-methyl-3-pentenal. The parent chain is pentenal, so a five-carbon aldehyde with a double bond at position 3 and a methyl group at position 3. The structure would be CH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCHO? Let's count the atoms. The parent chain is pentenal (C5H8O), adding a methyl group at position 3 would be C6H10O. So molecular weight is same as option A, 98. Wait, but how does the position affect the formula? The formula would still be C6H10O. So molecular weight is 98. So option C is also a possibility.\n\nOption D: 3-methyl-3-penten-2-one. The parent chain is penten-2-one, which is a five-carbon ketone with a double bond at position 3. The structure would be CH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCOCH3? Let's count the atoms. The ketone group is C=O, so the formula would be C5H8O for penten-2-one. Adding a methyl group at position 3 would make it C6H10O. So molecular weight is 6*12 + 10*1 + 16 = 98. So options A, C, and D all have molecular weight 98. But the mass spec peak is at 98, so all three are possible.\n\nNow, moving to the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a strong absorption at 1725 cm^-1. This is a key point. The 1725 cm^-1 is a strong absorption band for a carbonyl group (C=O). However, the exact position can help distinguish between different types of carbonyl groups. For example, aldehydes typically have a C=O stretch around 1720-1740 cm^-1, ketones around 1700-1720 cm^-1, esters around 1735-1750 cm^-1, and conjugated systems can shift the absorption to lower wavenumbers.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A: 2-methyl-3-pentenal. This is an aldehyde. The C=O stretch in aldehydes is typically around 1720-1740 cm^-1. The given IR peak is 1725 cm^-1, which fits an aldehyde. So that's possible.\n\nOption C: 3-methyl-3-pentenal. This is also an aldehyde. So same reasoning as A, so 1725 cm^-1 is possible.\n\nOption D: 3-methyl-3-penten-2-one. This is a ketone. The C=O stretch in ketones is around 1700-1720 cm^-1. The given IR peak is at 1725 cm^-1, which is slightly higher than typical for ketones. However, if the ketone is conjugated with a double bond, the absorption can be shifted to lower wavenumbers. Wait, but the position of the double bond might affect it. For example, if the ketone is conjugated with a double bond (like in a conjugated enone), the C=O stretch is around 1685-1700 cm^-1. However, if the ketone is not conjugated, it would be around 1715 cm^-1. The given IR peak is 1725, which is higher than typical for a non-conjugated ketone. So maybe the ketone here is not conjugated, leading to a higher wavenumber. Let me check the structure of option D. The structure is 3-methyl-3-penten-2-one. The double bond is at position 3 (between carbons 3 and 4), and the ketone is at position 2. So the structure would be CH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCOCH3? Wait, maybe the ketone is on carbon 2 and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So the ketone is adjacent to the double bond? Let me visualize: the structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2? No, with a double bond between 3 and 4. Let me try again. The parent chain is penten-2-one, so the ketone is on carbon 2. The double bond is at position 3, so between carbons 3 and 4. The structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH=CH2? But with a methyl group at position 3. So maybe CH2CH2-C(=O)-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, the methyl group is at position 3. So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, the double bond is at position 3. Let me try to write it properly. The parent chain is penten-2-one, so the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2? No, with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH=CH2. Adding a methyl group at position 3 would give CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but the double bond is between 3 and 4. So the correct structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)=CH2. In this case, the ketone is on carbon 2, and the double bond is between 3 and 4, with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the ketone is adjacent to the double bond? Wait, the ketone is on carbon 2, and the double bond is between 3 and 4, so there's one carbon between the ketone and the double bond. That means the ketone is not directly conjugated with the double bond. Therefore, the C=O stretch would be around 1715 cm^-1 for a non-conjugated ketone. However, the IR peak is at 1725 cm^-1, which is higher than typical for a non-conjugated ketone. This might suggest that option D is less likely, but it's not impossible. However, for aldehydes (options A and C), the absorption is in the 1720-1740 range, so 1725 is well within that range. So the IR data suggests that the compound is either A, C, or possibly D. \n\nNext, the 1H NMR data: several peaks observed, including a quartet at 5.3 ppm and a triplet at 9.7 ppm. Let's analyze these.\n\nFirst, the triplet at 9.7 ppm. In NMR, aldehydic protons (RCHO) typically appear around 9-10 ppm. So a triplet at 9.7 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton. This is a strong indicator that the compound is an aldehyde. If the compound were a ketone (option D), there would be no aldehyde proton, so the triplet at 9.7 ppm would not be present. Therefore, this suggests that the compound is either A or C, since those are aldehydes. Option D is a ketone and would not have an aldehyde proton. So that eliminates option D.\n\nNow, the quartet at 5.3 ppm. Quartet suggests that the proton is adjacent to three equivalent protons (n+1 rule, so n=3, meaning three neighboring protons). The chemical shift of 5.3 ppm is in the region of vinylic protons (double bond protons), which typically appear between 4.5-6.5 ppm. So a quartet at 5.3 ppm would suggest a proton on a carbon adjacent to three protons, likely a CH2 group next to a CH group. Let's look at the structures of options A and C.\n\nOption A: 2-methyl-3-pentenal. Structure: CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO. Let me break down the structure. The aldehyde group is at the end (CHO), then there's a CH=CH group. Let me number the carbons. Let's consider the parent chain as pentenal, so the aldehyde is at position 1. The structure would be:\n\n1: CHO\n\n2: CH2\n\n3: CH(CH3)\n\n4: CH\n\n5: CH2?\n\nWait, maybe I need to draw it properly. The correct structure for 2-methyl-3-pentenal would be CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO? Wait, no. Let me use IUPAC nomenclature. The name is 2-methyl-3-pentenal. The longest chain with the aldehyde group is pentanal, so five carbons with the aldehyde at position 1. The double bond is at position 3 (between carbons 3 and 4). The methyl group is at position 2. So the structure is:\n\nCH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nCarbon 1: CHO (aldehyde)\n\nCarbon 2: CH(CH3)- (so a CH group with a methyl branch)\n\nCarbon 3: CH= (double bond starts here)\n\nCarbon 4: CH-\n\nCarbon 5: CH2? No, wait, the chain is five carbons. Let me list the carbons:\n\nCarbon 1: CHO\n\nCarbon 2: CH(CH3) (since there's a methyl group at position 2)\n\nCarbon 3: CH= (double bond between 3 and 4)\n\nCarbon 4: CH2?\n\nWait, maybe I need to write the full structure:\n\nThe structure is CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO. Let me count the carbons:\n\n- The aldehyde (CHO) is carbon 1.\n\n- Then a CH group (carbon 2) with a methyl branch: CH(CH3)\n\n- Then a double bond between carbon 3 and 4: CH=CH-\n\n- Then another carbon (carbon 5) with the aldehyde? Wait, no, the aldehyde is at carbon 1. So the full structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CHO\n\nCarbon 2: CH(CH3)\n\nCarbon 3: CH= (double bond with carbon 4)\n\nCarbon 4: CH-\n\nCarbon 5: CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The parent chain is pentanal (five carbons with aldehyde at 1). The double bond is at position 3 (between carbons 3 and 4). The methyl group is at position 2. So the structure is:\n\nCH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO\n\nSo the full structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, the double bond is at position 3, so between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2? No, that would be a six-carbon chain. Wait, the parent chain is pentanal (five carbons). So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2? But that's six carbons. Wait, no. Let me count again. The parent chain is five carbons with an aldehyde group at position 1. The double bond is between positions 3 and 4. The methyl group is at position 2. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? But that would make the chain five carbons. Let me write it properly:\n\nCarbon 1: CHO\n\nCarbon 2: CH(CH3)\n\nCarbon 3: CH= (double bond with carbon 4)\n\nCarbon 4: CH-\n\nCarbon 5: CH2?\n\nWait, maybe the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? But that would be five carbons. Let me count:\n\n1: CHO\n\n2: CH(CH3)\n\n3: CH= (double bond with 4)\n\n4: CH-\n\n5: CH2?\n\nBut the aldehyde is at position 1. So the full structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? But that would make the chain longer than five. Wait, no. The parent chain is five carbons. So the correct structure should be:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2? No, that's six carbons. I must be making a mistake here. Let me recall that the parent chain for pentenal is five carbons with a double bond. The aldehyde is at position 1, and the double bond is at position 3. So the structure would be:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2? No, that's five carbons. Wait, maybe:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me use a different approach. Let's think about the molecular formula for option A, which we previously determined as C6H10O. Wait, but if it's a five-carbon chain with a methyl group, that would be six carbons. So the structure must have six carbons. Therefore, the parent chain is not pentanal but hexanal? Wait, no. The name is 2-methyl-3-pentenal, which suggests that the parent chain is pentanal (five carbons) with a methyl group on carbon 2. But adding a methyl group to pentanal would give six carbons. That's okay. So the structure is a five-carbon chain with a methyl branch, making it six carbons in total. \n\nLet me try to write the structure again. The aldehyde is at position 1. The double bond is at position 3 (between carbons 3 and 4). The methyl group is at position 2. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? No, that's five carbons in the main chain. Wait, the main chain is five carbons with the aldehyde at position 1. The methyl group is at position 2. The double bond is between positions 3 and 4. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? But that would be five carbons. Let me count:\n\n1: CHO\n\n2: CH(CH3)\n\n3: CH= (double bond with 4)\n\n4: CH-\n\n5: CH2?\n\nYes, that's five carbons in the main chain. The methyl group is a branch at position 2. So the full structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? But where is the end? The aldehyde is at position 1, and the rest of the chain is:\n\nCH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2?\n\nWait, maybe the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? No, the aldehyde is at position 1, then there's a CH(CH3) group at position 2, then a CH= group at position 3, then a CH group at position 4, and then a CH2 at position 5? That would make the full structure:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? But that ends with CH2. However, the molecular formula is C6H10O. Let me check. For the structure:\n\nCHO (1 carbon) + CH(CH3) (1 carbon) + CH=CH (2 carbons) + CH2 (1 carbon) = total 5 carbons in the main chain, plus the methyl group at position 2. So total 6 carbons. The formula would be:\n\nCHO has 1 carbon, 1 oxygen, and 1 hydrogen (but actually, the aldehyde group is CHO, which has 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H). The rest of the structure:\n\nCH(CH3) is a CH group with a methyl branch: that's 1 carbon in the main chain and 1 methyl group (so total 2 carbons). Then CH=CH is two carbons with a double bond. Then CH2 is one carbon. So total carbons: 1 (CHO) + 1 (CH(CH3)) + 2 (CH=CH) + 1 (CH2) = 5 in the main chain, plus the methyl group makes 6 total. \n\nNow, let's count the hydrogens. The aldehyde group has one H. The rest:\n\nThe CH(CH3) group has two Hs (since it's CH(CH3)). The CH=CH part has two Hs each (but with a double bond, so maybe fewer). Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's easier to look at the molecular formula, which we already know is C6H10O. \n\nNow, for the NMR data. The triplet at 9.7 ppm is the aldehyde proton. The quartet at 5.3 ppm. Let's think about what protons would give a quartet. A quartet implies that the proton is adjacent to three protons (n+1 rule). So if there's a CH2 group next to a CH group, the CH would split into a quartet due to the three protons on the CH2. \n\nLooking at option A: 2-methyl-3-pentenal. Let's try to identify which protons would give a quartet at 5.3 ppm. \n\nThe structure is CHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? Wait, maybe there's a vinylic proton adjacent to a CH2 group. Let me think about the structure. If there's a CH2 group next to a CH group, the CH would split into a quartet. For example, if there's a CH2 group with three protons adjacent to a CH group with one proton, the CH would split into a quartet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a vinylic proton that is adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, in the structure, there might be a CH2 group next to a CH=CH group. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 group next to a CH group. Let me try to think of the protons in option A. \n\nAssuming the structure is CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, maybe I should consider the protons on the double bond. The vinylic protons (on the double bond) typically appear around 4.5-6.5 ppm. A quartet at 5.3 ppm would suggest a proton on a carbon adjacent to three protons. For example, a proton on a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group. \n\nLet me consider the structure again. Let's break it down into fragments:\n\n- The aldehyde group (CHO) has a proton at ~9.7 ppm (triplet).\n\n- The methyl group (CH3) is on carbon 2.\n\n- The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2?\n\nWait, if there's a CH2 at the end, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2? But then where is the fifth carbon? I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the structure with correct IUPAC nomenclature.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is 2-methyl-3-pentenal. The longest chain with the aldehyde group is pentanal (five carbons). The double bond is at position 3 (between carbons 3 and 4). The methyl group is at position 2. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2? No, that would be 3-methyl-2-pentenal. Wait, the double bond position is 3, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. The methyl group is at position 2. So the correct structure is:\n\nCHO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that would have the double bond at position 4. I'm really struggling with the structure here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince the molecular formula is C6H10O, and the structure has an aldehyde group, a double bond, and a methyl group. Let's assume the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, but that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO. Let's count the atoms: \n\n- CH2: 2 H\n\n- CH(CH3): 1 C, 1 H, 1 CH3 (3 H)\n\n- CH=CH: 2 C with a double bond\n\n- CHO: 1 C, 1 O, 1 H\n\nTotal carbons: 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH(CH3)) + 2 (CH=CH) + 1 (CHO) = 5 in the main chain, plus the methyl group makes 6 total. Hydrogens: the CH2 has 2 H, the CH(CH3) has 1 H, the CH=CH has 2 H each (but with a double bond, maybe fewer), and the CHO has 1 H. This is too vague. Let's look at the NMR data again.\n\nThe quartet at 5.3 ppm suggests a proton adjacent to three protons. If this is a vinylic proton (on the double bond), it might be adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, if there's a CH2 group next to a CH=CH group, the CH= would split into a quartet due to the three protons on the CH2. \n\nAlternatively, if there's a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, the CH would split into a quartet. \n\nLet's consider option C: 3-methyl-3-pentenal. The structure would be a five-carbon chain with a methyl group at position 3, a double bond at position 3 (so between carbons 3 and 4), and an aldehyde at position 1. The structure would be CHO-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that would be 3-methyl-2-pentenal. Wait, the double bond is at position 3, so between carbons 3 and 4. The methyl group is at position 3. So the structure would be CHO-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's six carbons. Wait, the parent chain is pentenal (five carbons). So the structure would be CHO-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's six carbons. I'm confused again. Let me think about the molecular formula for option C. It's also C6H10O, same as A. \n\nFor option C, the structure is 3-methyl-3-pentenal. The double bond is at position 3 (between carbons 3 and 4), and the methyl group is also at position 3. So the structure would be CHO-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH-CH2? No, that's five carbons. Wait, the parent chain is pentenal, so five carbons. The methyl group is at position 3, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure would be:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH-CH2? No, that's five carbons. Let me write it as:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH-CH2? But again, I'm not sure. \n\nNow, considering the NMR data. The quartet at 5.3 ppm. Let's think about what protons would give this. For option A (2-methyl-3-pentenal), there might be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group. For example, if there's a CH2 next to a CH=CH group, the CH= would split into a quartet due to the three protons on the CH2. \n\nAlternatively, if there's a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group, the CH would split into a quartet. \n\nLet me consider the structure of option A again. If the structure has a CH2 group next to a CH=CH group, then the proton on the CH= would be adjacent to three protons (from the CH2), leading to a quartet. \n\nFor example, if there's a CH2CH group next to a CH=CH group, the proton on the CH would split into a quartet. \n\nIn option A, the structure is CHO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH2? Let's say there's a CH2 group at the end. The protons on the CH= would be adjacent to the CH2 group, leading to a quartet. \n\nAlternatively, the quartet could be from a CH2 group next to a CH group. For example, if there's a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, the CH group would split into a quartet. \n\nLet me think of a specific example. Suppose there's a CH2 group (three protons) next to a CH group (one proton). The CH proton would split into a quartet (n+1 where n=3). This is a classic case for a methyl group next to a methylene group. \n\nIn option A, if there's a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, then the CH proton would give a quartet. \n\nNow, looking at the structure of option A: 2-methyl-3-pentenal. The methyl group is at position 2, and the double bond is at position 3. So the structure might have a CH2 group next to a CH group. \n\nFor example, if the structure is CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO, then there might be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group. \n\nAlternatively, the quartet at 5.3 ppm could be from a vinylic proton adjacent to a CH2 group. \n\nLet me consider the chemical shift of 5.3 ppm. Vinylic protons typically appear between 4.5-6.5 ppm. A quartet at 5.3 ppm suggests a proton on a carbon adjacent to three protons. \n\nIn option A, if there's a proton on the double bond adjacent to a CH2 group with three protons, it would split into a quartet. \n\nFor example, in the structure CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CHO, the proton on the CH= group adjacent to the CH2 group would give a quartet. \n\nIn contrast, option C (3-methyl-3-pentenal) would have a different structure. The methyl group is at position 3, and the double bond is also at position 3. This might lead to a different NMR pattern. \n\nIn option C, the structure might have a methyl group on the same carbon as the double bond. This would lead to a different coupling pattern. \n\nFor example, if the structure is CHO-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, then the protons on the double bond might have different splitting patterns. However, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the NMR data, the triplet at 9.7 ppm (aldehyde proton) and the quartet at 5.3 ppm (suggesting a proton adjacent to three protons), option A (2-methyl-3-pentenal) seems more likely to fit this pattern. \n\nIn option A, the aldehyde proton is at 9.7 ppm as a triplet (suggesting it's adjacent to two protons), and the quartet at 5.3 ppm could be a proton on the double bond adjacent to a CH2 group with three protons. \n\nIn contrast, option C might have a different splitting pattern due to the position of the methyl group. \n\nTherefore, based on the NMR data and the IR data (strong absorption at 1725 cm^-1 for an aldehyde), the most likely compound is option A: 2-methyl-3-pentenal.\n</think>"}
