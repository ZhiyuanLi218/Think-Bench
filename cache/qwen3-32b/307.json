I need to find the actual power output of the car engine. The car is moving at a constant speed, so that probably means the forces are balanced. The mass of the car is given as 1.5 × 10³ kg, but maybe I don't need that because if it's moving at constant speed, acceleration is zero, so the net force is zero. Therefore, the engine's force must be equal to the resistance force. The resistance is 1.8 × 10³ N. \n\nPower is calculated as force times velocity, right? So if the engine is exerting a force equal to the resistance force to maintain constant speed, then the power should be force multiplied by the speed. Let me check the formula again. Power (P) equals force (F) multiplied by velocity (v), so P = F × v. \n\nGiven that the force here is 1.8 × 10³ N and velocity is 20 m/s. Let me compute that. 1.8 × 10³ N is 1800 N. Multiply that by 20 m/s. 1800 × 20... Let me calculate that. 1800 × 20 is 36,000. So that would be 36,000 watts. Converting that to kilowatts, since 1 kW is 1000 W, so 36,000 W is 36 kW. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 36 kW. So that should be the answer. Wait, but why is the mass given? Maybe it's a trick question where you might think you need to calculate something else, but since it's constant speed, the mass isn't necessary here. Because if there was acceleration, you might need mass to find the force, but since there isn't, the engine's force just needs to counteract the resistance. So yeah, I think option C is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
