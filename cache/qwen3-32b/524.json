{"question":"Question: Nuclear fusion power generation is expected to become one of the important means to solve human energy problems. Tritium $\\left({ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$ is the main material for nuclear fusion reactions. The following statements are correct. Options: (A) The neutron number of ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ is 2 (B) The nuclear charge number of ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ is 1 (C) ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ is the lightest atom in nature (D) ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ is an allotrope of the hydrogen element","answer":"B","index":524,"key_annotation_steps":{"solution1":{"logical_conclusion":["Step 1: The question asks about which statement regarding tritium (₁³H) is correct among options A, B, C, and D.","Step 2: Option A states that ₁³H has 2 neutrons. This is incorrect because the mass number of tritium is 3 (superscript), and the atomic number is 1 (subscript). The number of neutrons equals the mass number minus the atomic number: 3 - 1 = 2 neutrons. However, the option incorrectly labels the isotope as ₁²H instead of ₁³H.","Step 3: Option B states that ₁³H has a nuclear charge of 1. This is correct because the nuclear charge equals the atomic number, which is 1 for hydrogen.","Step 4: Option C states that ₁³H is the lightest atom in nature. This is incorrect because protium (₁¹H) is lighter than tritium.","Step 5: Option D states that ₁³H is an allotrope of hydrogen. This is incorrect because tritium is an isotope of hydrogen, not an allotrope. Allotropes are different molecular forms of the same element.","Step 6: Therefore, option B is the only correct statement."]}},"question_type":"Easy","category":"chemistry","subcategory":"others","prediction":"To determine the correct statement regarding the isotope ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ (also known as deuterium), we analyze the atomic structure and terminology used in nuclear chemistry.\n\n---\n\n### Isotope Notation Breakdown:\n\n- **Atomic number (Z)**: The subscript (1) represents the number of protons in the nucleus.\n- **Mass number (A)**: The superscript (2) is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\n\nFrom this, we calculate:\n- **Number of protons**: 1 (atomic number)\n- **Number of neutrons**: $2 - 1 = 1$\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Each Option:\n\n- **Option A**: *\"The neutron number of ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ is 2.\"*  \n  This is **incorrect**. As calculated, the number of neutrons is 1, not 2.\n\n- **Option B**: *\"The nuclear charge number of ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ is 1.\"*  \n  The nuclear charge is determined by the number of protons, which is 1. This is **correct**.\n\n- **Option C**: *\"${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ is the lightest atom in nature.\"*  \n  The lightest isotope of hydrogen is ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ (protium), not deuterium. This is **incorrect**.\n\n- **Option D**: *\"${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ is an allotrope of the hydrogen element.\"*  \n  Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element (e.g., diamond and graphite for carbon). Deuterium is an **isotope**, not an allotrope. This is **incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D are correct regarding tritium, which is given as _1^2 H. Let me start by recalling what each part of the isotope notation means. The bottom number is the atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus. The top number is the mass number, which is the sum of protons and neutrons.\n\nSo for _1^2 H, the atomic number (Z) is 1, meaning there's 1 proton. The mass number (A) is 2. To find the number of neutrons, I subtract the atomic number from the mass number: 2 - 1 = 1. So the neutron number is 1. Therefore, option A says the neutron number is 2, which would be incorrect. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B states the nuclear charge number is 1. The nuclear charge is determined by the number of protons, which is the atomic number. Since the atomic number here is 1, that means the nuclear charge is +1. So B is correct.\n\nOption C claims that _1^2 H is the lightest atom in nature. The lightest atom would be the one with the lowest atomic mass. The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium, which is _1^1 H (1 proton, 0 neutrons). Tritium is _1^3 H (1 proton, 2 neutrons). Wait, but the question here is about _1^2 H. That's deuterium, right? Deuterium has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So its mass number is 2. The lightest atom would be protium (mass number 1), so deuterium isn't the lightest. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says that _1^2 H is an allotrope of the hydrogen element. Allotropes are different forms of the same element in the same physical state. For example, oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3) are allotropes. However, isotopes are variants of an element with different numbers of neutrons. So _1^2 H (deuterium) is an isotope of hydrogen, not an allotrope. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B. Let me just double-check each point again.\n\nA: Neutron number is 2? No, 2-1=1. Incorrect.\n\nB: Nuclear charge is 1? Yes, because protons are 1. Correct.\n\nC: Lightest atom? No, protium is lighter. Incorrect.\n\nD: Allotrope? No, it's an isotope. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n</think>"}
