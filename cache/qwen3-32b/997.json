The options are A to D. Hmm, entropy change... I remember that entropy change (ΔS) is related to the heat involved in a process divided by the temperature at which it occurs. The formula is ΔS = q_rev / T, right? Since vaporization is a phase change, it happens at a constant temperature, which for water is 100°C, or 373.15 K. \n\nBut wait, the heat of vaporization is given in kJ per mole. So, first, I need to make sure the units are consistent. The question asks for entropy in J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹. So I should convert 43.9 kJ to joules. Let me do that: 43.9 kJ is 43,900 J. \n\nNow, using the formula ΔS = ΔH_vap / T. The ΔH here is the molar heat of vaporization, which is 43,900 J/mol. The temperature T is 373.15 K. So plugging in the numbers: ΔS = 43900 J/mol / 373.15 K. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, dividing 43900 by 373.15. Let me approximate. Let's see, 373 times 100 is 37,300. 373 times 118 would be... Well, maybe I can do 43900 divided by 373. Let me use a calculator here. 43900 divided by 373.15. Let me check that. \n\nWell, 373.15 times 117 is 373.15*100=37315, 373.15*17=6343.55, so total is 37315+6343.55=43658.55 J. That's pretty close to 43900. So 117 K would give about 43658.55 J, and the difference between 43900 and that is 43900 - 43658.55 = 241.45 J. So 241.45 / 373.15 ≈ 0.647. So total entropy would be approximately 117.647 J/mol·K. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 118 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹. That seems to fit. Let me check again. Maybe I miscalculated. Let me do the exact division: 43900 divided by 373.15. Let me compute 43900 / 373.15. Let me do this division step by step. \n\nFirst, approximate 373.15 * 118 = ?\n\nWell, 373.15 * 100 = 37315\n\n373.15 * 18 = ?\n\n373.15 * 10 = 3731.5\n\n373.15 * 8 = 2985.2\n\nSo 3731.5 + 2985.2 = 6716.7\n\nTotal 37315 + 6716.7 = 44031.7 J. \n\nBut the ΔH is 43900 J, which is slightly less than 44031.7. So 373.15 * 118 ≈ 44031.7, which is higher than 43900. Therefore, the actual value is a little less than 118. Let me compute how much less. \n\nThe difference between 44031.7 and 43900 is 131.7 J. So how much is 131.7 / 373.15? That's approximately 0.353. So subtract that from 118: 118 - 0.353 ≈ 117.647 J/mol·K. So approximately 117.6 J/mol·K. The closest option is D:118. So even though it's slightly less, the options don't have 117.6, but D is 118. So that must be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the temperature. Wait, is the boiling point of water exactly 100°C? Well, standard boiling point is 100°C at 1 atm, which is 373.15 K. So that's correct. The molar heat of vaporization is given as +43.9 kJ. So converting that to J is 43900 J. \n\nTherefore, ΔS = 43900 J/mol / 373.15 K ≈ 117.6 J/mol·K. Since the options are given as whole numbers, and D is 118, which is the closest, so the answer should be D. \n\nBut wait, let me check if maybe the question is using a different value for the molar heat of vaporization. Wait, the standard molar heat of vaporization of water is actually about 40.7 kJ/mol, but here it's given as 43.9 kJ. Maybe this is under different conditions? Or maybe it's a hypothetical question. Anyway, the problem states that the molar heat of vaporization is +43.9 kJ, so we have to use that value. \n\nSo with that value, the calculation gives approximately 117.6 J/mol·K, which rounds to 118 J/mol·K. Therefore, the correct answer is D. \n\nLet me just verify once more. Let me compute 43.9 kJ divided by 373.15 K. \n\n43.9 kJ is 43900 J. \n\nDivide 43900 by 373.15. \n\nLet me do this division more accurately. \n\nLet me write it as 43900 / 373.15. \n\nLet me approximate 373.15 as 373 for simplicity. \n\nSo 43900 / 373 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 373 × 117 = ?\n\nAs before, 373 × 100 = 37300\n\n373 × 17 = 6341\n\nTotal 37300 + 6341 = 43641\n\nSo 373 × 117 = 43641\n\nSubtract that from 43900: 43900 - 43641 = 259\n\nSo now, 259 / 373 ≈ 0.694\n\nSo total is 117.694 J/mol·K, which is approximately 117.7 J/mol·K. So again, 117.7 rounds to 118. So D is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
