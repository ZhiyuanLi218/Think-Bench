I need to find the period of a satellite orbiting near the surface of a uniform spherical celestial body with density ρ and gravitational constant G. The options are given, so maybe I can derive the formula step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a satellite in circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force. So, I can start by equating those two forces.\n\nThe gravitational force is given by Newton's law of gravitation: F = G * (M * m) / r², where M is the mass of the celestial body, m is the mass of the satellite, and r is the radius of the orbit. Since the satellite is near the surface, I can approximate r as being equal to the radius of the celestial body itself, let's call it R.\n\nThe centripetal force required for circular motion is F = m * v² / r, where v is the orbital speed of the satellite.\n\nSetting them equal: G * M * m / r² = m * v² / r. The mass of the satellite m cancels out, so we get G * M / r² = v² / r. Simplifying that, G * M / r = v².\n\nNow, the period T is related to the orbital speed v by the circumference of the orbit. The circumference is 2πr, so v = 2πr / T. Let me plug that into the equation above.\n\nG * M / r = (2πr / T)². Expanding that, G * M / r = 4π²r² / T². Then, solving for T²:\n\nT² = (4π²r³) / (G * M). Therefore, T = 2π * sqrt(r³ / (G * M)). \n\nBut the problem gives me the density ρ of the celestial body instead of its mass or radius. Since density is mass over volume, ρ = M / ( (4/3)πR³ ). Therefore, M = ρ * (4/3)πR³. \n\nSince the satellite is near the surface, r ≈ R. Let me substitute M and r with expressions involving ρ and R. \n\nSo substituting M into the equation for T²:\n\nT² = (4π²R³) / (G * (4/3)πρR³)). Let me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write out the denominator: G * (4/3)πρR³. The numerator is 4π²R³. \n\nSo T² = [4π²R³] / [ (4/3)πGρR³ ) ].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe R³ terms cancel out. The 4 in the numerator cancels with the 4 in the denominator, leaving 1 in the denominator. π² in the numerator divided by π in the denominator gives π. So we have:\n\nT² = [π] / [ (1/3) G ρ ) ]? Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, denominator is (4/3)πGρ. So:\n\nNumerator: 4π² R³\n\nDenominator: G * (4/3)πρ R³\n\nSo dividing numerator by denominator: (4π² R³) / ( (4/3)π G ρ R³ ) ) \n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n4 divided by (4/3) is 3. π² divided by π is π. R³ cancels. So overall, T² = 3π / (G ρ). Therefore, T is sqrt(3π/(Gρ)).\n\nLooking at the options, that's option A: sqrt(3π/(Gρ)).\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting from T² = (4π²r³)/(GM). Then substituting M = (4/3)πρr³. Wait, hold on, if the satellite is orbiting at radius r ≈ R, and the celestial body has radius R, then M is (4/3)πR³ ρ. So substituting into T²:\n\nT² = 4π² R³ / [ G * (4/3)π R³ ρ ) ] \n\nYes, the R³ cancels. Then 4π² divided by (4/3 π G ρ) is (4 / (4/3)) * (π² / π) / (G ρ) = 3 * π / (G ρ). Therefore, T² = 3π/(Gρ), so T = sqrt(3π/(Gρ)), which is option A. \n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using Kepler's third law or something else? But I think the derivation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I recall that for a circular orbit near the surface, the period can be related to the density. Since density is mass per volume, and higher density would mean stronger gravity, so shorter period. The formula having density in the denominator inside the square root makes sense because higher density would lead to smaller T. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is sqrt(3π/(Gρ)), which matches our result. So the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
