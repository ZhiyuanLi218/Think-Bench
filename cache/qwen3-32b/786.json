The SMILES string is quite long, so I need to break it down step by step. First, I remember that rotatable bonds are single bonds that are not in rings or adjacent to double bonds. So I need to identify all the single bonds that are not part of a ring and not next to a double bond.\n\nLet me start by parsing the SMILES string. The molecule is a complex peptide-like structure with multiple amide bonds (C(=O)NC), which are usually single bonds between the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen. Amide bonds can sometimes be considered non-rotatable if they have partial double bond character, but I think in the context of rotatable bonds, they are usually counted as non-rotatable. So the single bonds in the amide group (C-N) are not rotatable because of the conjugation with the double bond.\n\nNow, I'll go through the SMILES and try to identify all the single bonds that are not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The molecule starts with 'CC(=O)NC(...)'. The first part is 'CC(=O)NC', which is a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen. The bond between C and C(=O) is a single bond, but since the next bond is a double bond (C=O), the bond before the double bond (C-C) is adjacent to a double bond. Wait, no, the first bond is between the two carbons (C-C), then the next is C(=O). So the C-C bond is not adjacent to a double bond. Wait, the first part is 'CC(=O)NC', so the first two carbons are connected by a single bond. The next is a carbonyl (C=O), so the bond between the first C and the carbonyl C is a single bond. Is that adjacent to a double bond? The carbonyl is a double bond, so the bond between the two carbons (C-C) and the C(=O) is adjacent. So the C-C bond here is adjacent to a double bond, making it non-rotatable? Or is the C-C bond adjacent to the amide bond?\n\nWait, the structure is C-C(=O)-N. The bond between the first C and the carbonyl C is a single bond. The next bond is a double bond (C=O). So the single bond between the two carbons is adjacent to a double bond, so that bond is not rotatable. Therefore, that single bond is not counted as a rotatable bond.\n\nThen, the next bond is between the carbonyl C and the nitrogen (C-N). That's a single bond, but since the carbonyl is a double bond, the C-N bond is adjacent to a double bond. So that bond is also not rotatable. So in the first part, there are no rotatable bonds.\n\nNext part is 'C(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC...'. Let's look at the 'CCCNC(=N)N' part. The three carbons connected by single bonds. The first two C-C bonds are single bonds, not in rings, and not adjacent to double bonds. So those two bonds are rotatable. The third C is connected to N. Then N is connected to C(=N)N. The bond between C and N here is a single bond. The next bond is a double bond (C=N). So the bond between the third C and N is adjacent to a double bond, making it non-rotatable. So the two C-C bonds in the 'CCC' part are rotatable. Then the bond between the third C and N is not.\n\nNow, moving on. After that, there's 'C(=O)NC(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)C(=O)NC...'. Let's see. The 'C(=O)NC' part again. The C-N bond is a single bond adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so not rotatable. Then the next part is 'C(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)...'. The bond between the previous carbon and the next carbon is a single bond. The next carbon is connected to N. Let's check if that bond is in a ring. The 'CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O' part suggests a ring. The '1' is a ring closure. So the bond between C and N here is part of a ring. Therefore, any bonds in the ring are not considered rotatable. So the bonds in the ring (like the C-C, C-N, etc.) are not counted.\n\nContinuing through the SMILES, there are multiple ring closures (like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.), indicating multiple rings. Each time a ring is formed, the bonds in the ring are not rotatable. Also, any bonds adjacent to double bonds (like in amides, carbonyls) are non-rotatable.\n\nThis seems tedious, but maybe there's a pattern. The molecule is a peptide chain with multiple amide bonds and some cyclic structures. Each amide bond (C(=O)NC) contributes a non-rotatable bond (the C-N bond). The single bonds between the alpha carbons (the carbons attached to the amide N) and the next carbon would be rotatable if they are not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nIn a typical peptide chain, each amide bond is followed by a single bond between the alpha carbon and the next carbon. For example, in a dipeptide, you have C(=O)-N-Cα-C. The bond between Cα and C is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond, so it's rotatable. So in a peptide chain, each amide bond would contribute a rotatable bond after the alpha carbon.\n\nBut in this molecule, there are multiple side chains and rings. Each time there's a branching or a ring, the bonds in the side chain or ring may or may not be rotatable.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe it's easier to count the number of single bonds that are not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a way to estimate based on the structure. Let's see: the molecule is a polypeptide-like structure with multiple amide bonds. Let's count the number of amide bonds first. Each 'C(=O)NC' is an amide. Let's see how many times that occurs in the SMILES.\n\nLooking at the SMILES: 'CC(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)C(=O)NC(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)NC(CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O)C(=O)NC(CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O)C(=O)NC(CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O)C(=O)NC(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N'\n\nWait, the user's SMILES is written with multiple CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O, etc. Let me count the number of 'C(=O)NC' sequences. Each time there's a 'C(=O)NC', that's an amide bond. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. 'CC(=O)NC' → first amide\n2. Then 'C(=O)NC' → second\n3. Then 'C(=O)NC' → third\n4. Then 'C(=O)NC' → fourth\n5. Then 'C(=O)NC' → fifth\n6. Then 'C(=O)NC' → sixth\n7. Then 'C(=O)NC' → seventh\n8. Then 'C(=O)NC' → eighth\n9. Then 'C(=O)NC' → ninth\n10. Then 'C(=O)NC' → tenth\n11. Then 'C(=O)NC' → eleventh\n12. Then 'C(=O)NC' → twelfth\n13. Then 'C(=O)NC' → thirteenth\n14. Then 'C(=O)N' at the end → fourteenth? Or is the last 'C(=O)N' part of the thirteenth?\n\nWait, the SMILES ends with 'C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N'? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal SMILES: 'CC(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)C(=O)NC(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)NC(CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O)C(=O)NC(CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O)C(=O)NC(CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O)C(=O)NC(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N'\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. CC(=O)NC(...) → first amide\n2. Then C(=O)NC(...) → second\n3. Then C(=O)NC(...) → third\n4. Then C(=O)NC(...) → fourth\n5. Then C(=O)NC(...) → fifth\n6. Then C(=O)NC(...) → sixth\n7. Then C(=O)NC(...) → seventh\n8. Then C(=O)NC(...) → eighth\n9. Then C(=O)NC(...) → ninth\n10. Then C(=O)NC(...) → tenth\n11. Then C(=O)NC(...) → eleventh\n12. Then C(=O)NC(...) → twelfth\n13. Then C(=O)NC(...) → thirteenth\n14. Then C(=O)N at the end → fourteenth amide?\n\nWait, the last part is 'C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N'. So the last amide is 'C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N', but the last bond is C(=O)N, which is a single bond between C and N, adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so non-rotatable. So that's the fourteenth amide bond.\n\nSo there are 14 amide bonds. Each amide bond contributes a non-rotatable bond (the C-N bond). Between each amide bond, there's a single bond between the alpha carbon and the next carbon. For example, in a peptide, each amide is followed by a Cα-C bond, which is rotatable. So in a linear peptide with n amide bonds, there are n-1 rotatable bonds from the backbone. But in this case, the molecule is not a linear peptide because there are branches and rings.\n\nEach time there's a side chain or a ring, the rotatable bonds may be affected. Let's try to count the rotatable bonds step by step.\n\nStarting from the first part: CC(=O)NC(...) \n\n- The first C-C bond is adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so not rotatable.\n- The bond between C(=O) and N is a single bond adjacent to a double bond, not rotatable.\n- Then, the N is connected to a carbon (C) in the next part: CCCNC(=N)N. The bond between N and the first C is a single bond. Is that adjacent to a double bond? The next part is C(=N)N, so the bond between the first C and the next C is a single bond. Let's see: the sequence is CCCNC(=N)N. The first two C-C bonds are single bonds, not adjacent to double bonds. The third C is connected to N. The bond between the third C and N is followed by a double bond (C=N), so that bond is adjacent to a double bond, making it non-rotatable. So the two C-C bonds in the 'CCC' part are rotatable. So that's 2 rotatable bonds.\n\nThen, the N is connected to C(=N)N. The bond between N and C is a single bond adjacent to a double bond (C=N), so not rotatable.\n\nNext, the main chain continues with C(=O)NC(...). The bond between the previous carbon and the next C(=O) is a single bond. Wait, the structure is ...CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC(...). The bond between the N and the C(=O) is a single bond. The C(=O) is a carbonyl group, so the bond between N and C(=O) is adjacent to a double bond (C=O), making it non-rotatable. Then the bond between C(=O) and the next N is a single bond adjacent to a double bond, so non-rotatable.\n\nThen, the next part is C(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O). The bond between the previous C and the next C is a single bond. The next C is connected to N. The 'CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O' forms a ring. The bond between C and N is part of a ring, so not rotatable. So the bond between the previous C and this C is a single bond not in a ring. Is it adjacent to a double bond? The previous bond was C(=O)NC, so the bond between C and N is adjacent to a double bond (C=O). Wait, the bond between the previous C (from the amide) and the next C is a single bond. Is this bond adjacent to a double bond? The previous bond is C(=O)NC, so the bond between the amide's C and N is adjacent to a double bond. The next bond is between N and C (part of the ring). So the bond between the amide's C and N is non-rotatable. The bond between N and the next C is part of the ring, so not rotatable. The bond between the previous C (from the amide) and the next C (in the ring) is a single bond not in a ring. Is it adjacent to a double bond? The previous bond was C(=O)N, so the bond between the amide's C and N is adjacent to a double bond. The bond between N and the next C is part of the ring. So the bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. Wait, the amide is C(=O)N-C... So the bond between N and the next C is a single bond. Is that adjacent to a double bond? The N is connected to the C, which is part of a ring. The previous bond (C=O-N) is adjacent to a double bond. The bond between N and the next C is not adjacent to a double bond. Therefore, that bond is rotatable. Wait, but the N is part of the ring? No, the ring is formed by the CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O. The bond between N and C is part of the ring. So the bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is a single bond not in a ring and not adjacent to a double bond. Therefore, it's a rotatable bond. So that's +1.\n\nThen, moving into the ring structure. The bonds in the ring are not rotatable. The ring is CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O. So there are two double bonds in the ring (C=CC(=O)N), but the bonds in the ring are not considered rotatable.\n\nNext, the main chain continues with C(=O)NC(...). The bond between the ring's C and the next C(=O) is a single bond. The C(=O) is a carbonyl, so the bond between the ring's C and C(=O) is a single bond adjacent to a double bond (C=O), making it non-rotatable. Then the bond between C(=O) and N is a single bond adjacent to a double bond, non-rotatable.\n\nThe next part is C(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O). The bond between the previous C and the next C is a single bond. The next C is part of a chain leading to a phenol (CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O). The bonds in the phenol ring are not rotatable. The bond between the amide's C and the first C of the phenol chain is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. So that's a rotatable bond. Then, the next C is connected to the ring. So the bond between the amide's C and the first C of the phenol chain is +1 rotatable bond.\n\nThen, the main chain continues with C(=O)NC(...). The bond between the phenol's C and the next C(=O) is a single bond adjacent to a double bond (C=O), non-rotatable. The bond between C(=O) and N is non-rotatable.\n\nNext part is C(CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O). The bond between the previous C and the next C is a single bond. The next C is connected to N. The 'CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O' forms another ring. The bond between C and N is part of the ring. The bond between the amide's C and this C is a single bond not in a ring. Is it adjacent to a double bond? The previous bond was C(=O)NC, so the bond between the amide's C and N is adjacent to a double bond. The bond between N and the next C is part of the ring. The bond between the amide's C and the next C is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. Therefore, that's a rotatable bond. +1.\n\nInside the ring, bonds are not rotatable.\n\nContinuing, the main chain has C(=O)NC(...). The bond between the ring's C and the next C(=O) is a single bond adjacent to a double bond (non-rotatable). The bond between C(=O) and N is non-rotatable.\n\nNext is CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O. Similar to before, the bond between the previous C and the first C of the phenol chain is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. So +1 rotatable bond.\n\nThen, another C(=O)NC(...). The bond between the phenol's C and the next C(=O) is non-rotatable. The bond between C(=O) and N is non-rotatable.\n\nNext part is C(CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O). Again, the bond between the previous C and the next C is a single bond. The next C is connected to N in a ring. So the bond between the amide's C and this C is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. +1 rotatable bond.\n\nThen, C(=O)NC(...). The bond between the ring's C and the next C(=O) is non-rotatable. The bond between C(=O) and N is non-rotatable.\n\nNext is C(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O). Similar to before, the bond between the previous C and the next C is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. +1 rotatable bond.\n\nThen, C(=O)NC(...). The bond between the ring's C and the next C(=O) is non-rotatable. The bond between C(=O) and N is non-rotatable.\n\nNext part is C(CCCNC(=N)N). The bond between the previous C and the first C of the 'CCCNC(=N)N' is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. The 'CCC' part has two C-C bonds, which are rotatable. So that's +2 rotatable bonds here.\n\nThen, the main chain ends with C(=O)N. The bond between the last C and N is a single bond adjacent to a double bond, non-rotatable.\n\nNow, let's tally up the rotatable bonds I've identified:\n\n1. In the first 'CCC' part: 2\n2. After the first amide and ring: +1\n3. After the ring and phenol: +1\n4. After the next amide and ring: +1\n5. After phenol: +1\n6. After amide and ring: +1\n7. After phenol: +1\n8. After amide and ring: +1\n9. In the final 'CCC' part: +2\n\nWait, let me recount more carefully:\n\nFrom the breakdown above, each time there's a segment after an amide bond that's not part of a ring, there's a rotatable bond. Let me list them step by step:\n\n- After the first amide (CC(=O)NC...), the 'CCC' part gives 2 rotatable bonds.\n- Then, after the next amide (C(=O)NC(...)), the bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is +1.\n- After that amide (C(=O)NC(...)), the bond between the amide's C and the phenol chain's C is +1.\n- After the next amide (C(=O)NC(...)), the bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is +1.\n- After that amide (C(=O)NC(...)), the bond between the amide's C and the phenol chain's C is +1.\n- After the next amide (C(=O)NC(...)), the bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is +1.\n- After that amide (C(=O)NC(...)), the bond between the amide's C and the phenol chain's C is +1.\n- After the next amide (C(=O)NC(...)), the bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is +1.\n- Finally, the 'CCCNC(=N)N' part gives 2 rotatable bonds.\n\nSo that's 2 +1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2 = Let's add them:\n\nStart with 2 from the first CCC.\n\nThen adding 1 seven times: 2 +7=9.\n\nPlus the final 2: 9+2=11.\n\nWait, but there are 14 amide bonds. Each amide bond is followed by a carbon chain or ring. But in some cases, the chain leads to a ring, which would only add one rotatable bond (the bond before the ring). In other cases, like the phenol chain, it's a single bond leading to a ring, adding one rotatable bond. The final 'CCC' part adds two.\n\nBut maybe I missed some. Let's see: each amide bond is followed by a carbon that connects to the next part. For each amide bond, there's a single bond between the alpha carbon and the next carbon, which is rotatable unless it's adjacent to a double bond or part of a ring.\n\nIn this molecule, after each amide bond, the next carbon is either leading to a ring or a side chain. So for each amide bond, there's one rotatable bond, except when the next carbon is part of a ring directly. Wait, but in some cases, the next carbon is part of a ring, so the bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is rotatable (since it's not in the ring and not adjacent to a double bond).\n\nSo if there are 14 amide bonds, there are 14 such bonds. But some of them might be part of rings or adjacent to double bonds.\n\nWait, in the first amide, the next carbon is part of a 'CCC' chain, giving 2 rotatable bonds. Wait, maybe my previous approach is not systematic.\n\nAlternative approach: each amide bond (C(=O)N) is followed by a carbon (the alpha carbon). The bond between the alpha carbon and the next carbon is rotatable if it's not adjacent to a double bond or part of a ring.\n\nIn a typical peptide, each amide bond is followed by a Cα-C bond, which is rotatable. So for n amide bonds, there are n-1 such bonds in a linear peptide. But here, the molecule is not linear because of the multiple side chains and rings. However, each amide bond is followed by a carbon that connects to the next part. So for each amide bond, there's one rotatable bond, unless the next carbon is part of a ring or the bond is adjacent to a double bond.\n\nLooking at the SMILES structure, after each amide bond (C(=O)N), the next carbon is connected to either another carbon (leading to a chain) or directly to a ring. For example:\n\n- After the first amide, it's connected to CCC... which has two C-C bonds (so two rotatable bonds).\n- After the second amide, it's connected to a ring (so one rotatable bond).\n- After the third amide, it's connected to a phenol chain (one rotatable bond).\n- After the fourth amide, connected to a ring (one rotatable bond).\n- After the fifth amide, connected to a phenol chain (one rotatable bond).\n- After the sixth amide, connected to a ring (one rotatable bond).\n- After the seventh amide, connected to a phenol chain (one rotatable bond).\n- After the eighth amide, connected to a ring (one rotatable bond).\n- After the ninth amide, connected to a phenol chain (one rotatable bond).\n- After the tenth amide, connected to a ring (one rotatable bond).\n- After the eleventh amide, connected to a phenol chain (one rotatable bond).\n- After the twelfth amide, connected to a ring (one rotatable bond).\n- After the thirteenth amide, connected to a CCC... chain (two rotatable bonds).\n- After the fourteenth amide, connected to nothing (ends with C(=O)N).\n\nWait, but the fourteenth amide is the last one, ending with C(=O)N, so there's no bond after that.\n\nSo, for each of the 14 amide bonds, except the last one, there's a rotatable bond after the alpha carbon. However, in some cases, the alpha carbon is part of a longer chain (like the first and thirteenth amides), adding more rotatable bonds.\n\nThe first amide is followed by a 'CCC' chain, which has two C-C bonds. The thirteenth amide is followed by a 'CCC' chain, which also has two C-C bonds. The other amides are followed by a single bond to a ring or phenol, which adds one rotatable bond each.\n\nSo, let's calculate:\n\n- For the first amide: 2 rotatable bonds (from the 'CCC')\n- For the thirteenth amide: 2 rotatable bonds (from the 'CCC')\n- For the remaining 12 amides (from 2nd to 12th and the 14th?), but wait, the fourteenth amide is the last one and doesn't contribute. So from amide 2 to amide 13, excluding the first and thirteenth, but the thirteenth is already counted.\n\nWait, total amide bonds are 14. The first amide contributes 2, the thirteenth contributes 2, and the other 12 amides (from 2nd to 13th, excluding the first and thirteenth?) No, let me clarify.\n\nActually, the molecule has 14 amide bonds. Let's number them from 1 to 14. The first amide is followed by a 'CCC' chain (2 bonds). The thirteenth amide is followed by a 'CCC' chain (2 bonds). The other amides (2nd to 12th, and the 14th?) Each of these amides is followed by a single bond to a ring or phenol, contributing 1 rotatable bond each.\n\nBut the fourteenth amide is the last one, which ends with C(=O)N, so there's no bond after it. So amides 1-13 each have a following carbon, and amide 14 doesn't.\n\nSo amides 1-13: 13 amides. Among them, amides 1 and 13 contribute 2 each, and the other 11 amides contribute 1 each.\n\nSo total rotatable bonds from these parts: 2+2 + 11*1 = 4 +11=15.\n\nBut wait, the first amide's 'CCC' part has two C-C bonds, which are both rotatable. Similarly for the thirteenth amide's 'CCC' part. So each of those contributes two rotatable bonds. The other amides contribute one each.\n\nSo total from the amide following bonds: 2 (amide 1) + 2 (amide 13) + 11 (amides 2-12) = 2+2+11=15.\n\nBut wait, amide 13 is the thirteenth amide. Are there 13 amides up to that point? Let me confirm the count of amide bonds.\n\nOriginal SMILES: Let's count the number of 'C(=O)NC' or 'C(=O)N' at the end.\n\nThe SMILES is:\n\nCC(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)C(=O)NC(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)NC(CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O)C(=O)NC(CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O)C(=O)NC(CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O)C(=O)NC(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N\n\nLet's count the 'C(=O)NC' sequences:\n\n1. CC(=O)NC(...) → 1\n2. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 2\n3. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 3\n4. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 4\n5. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 5\n6. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 6\n7. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 7\n8. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 8\n9. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 9\n10. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 10\n11. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 11\n12. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 12\n13. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 13\n14. ...C(=O)N at the end → 14th amide (C(=O)N)\n\nSo there are 14 amide bonds. The fourteenth ends with C(=O)N, so no bond after it. The thirteenth amide is followed by 'CCCNC(=N)N', which is the 'CCC' part contributing two rotatable bonds.\n\nSo amides 1 and 13 contribute 2 each, and the other 12 amides (2-12 and 14? No, amide 14 has no following bond). So amides 1-13 have following bonds. Among them, amides 1 and 13 contribute 2 each, the rest (11 amides) contribute 1 each.\n\nTotal from amide following bonds: 2+2+11=15.\n\nBut wait, amides 2-12 are 11 amides (from 2 to 12 inclusive is 11 amides). Then amide 13 is the 13th, so yes.\n\nNow, are there any other rotatable bonds in the molecule that are not accounted for in the amide following bonds?\n\nFor example, in the 'CCCNC(=N)N' part of the first amide's side chain, there are two C-C bonds. Are there any other single bonds in the side chains that are not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds?\n\nLooking at the side chains:\n\n- The first side chain is 'CCCNC(=N)N'. The 'CCC' has two C-C bonds, which are rotatable. The bond between the third C and N is adjacent to a double bond (C=N), so non-rotatable.\n\n- The other side chains are rings or phenol groups. For example, 'CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O' is a ring with double bonds, so no rotatable bonds in the ring. The phenol part 'CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O' is a benzene ring, so no rotatable bonds there.\n\n- The other rings like 'CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O' are also aromatic rings, so no rotatable bonds in the rings.\n\nTherefore, the only rotatable bonds are those in the amide following bonds and the two C-C bonds in the first and thirteenth amide's side chains.\n\nSo total rotatable bonds are 15.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A:47, B:49, C:34, D:65. 15 is not among them. Clearly, I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me reconsider. Perhaps my approach is too simplistic. Maybe I'm missing many rotatable bonds in the side chains.\n\nLet me think again. Each time there's a carbon chain that's not part of a ring and not adjacent to a double bond, each single bond in that chain is rotatable.\n\nFor example, in the first part 'CCCNC(=N)N', the 'CCC' has two C-C bonds, which are rotatable. But maybe there are more such chains in the molecule.\n\nLet me parse the SMILES again and identify all the carbon chains that are not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. 'CC(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)...'\n\n- The first C-C bond is adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so non-rotatable.\n- The bond between C(=O) and N is adjacent to a double bond, non-rotatable.\n- The bond between N and the first C of the 'CCC' chain is a single bond. Is it adjacent to a double bond? The next bond is C-C, so no. So this bond is rotatable. Then the two C-C bonds in the 'CCC' are also rotatable. So that's three rotatable bonds in this part.\n\nWait, earlier I thought only the two C-C bonds in the 'CCC' were rotatable, but the bond between N and the first C is also a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. Let me check:\n\nThe structure is N-C-C-C-... The bond between N and the first C is a single bond. The previous bond was N-C(=O)..., so the bond between N and C is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. Therefore, that bond is rotatable. So the 'N-C-C-C' part has three rotatable bonds (N-C, C-C, C-C). But wait, the first C in the 'CCC' is connected to N. The bond between N and C is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond. So that's one rotatable bond. Then the two C-C bonds in the 'CCC' are two more. So total of 3 rotatable bonds in this part.\n\nSimilarly, in the thirteenth amide's side chain 'CCCNC(=N)N', the same applies: three rotatable bonds.\n\nIf that's the case, then my previous count was missing these bonds.\n\nLet me correct my approach:\n\nEach time there's a carbon chain following an amide, each single bond in that chain is rotatable if not adjacent to a double bond or in a ring.\n\nSo for the first amide's side chain 'CCCNC(=N)N', the bonds are:\n\n- N-C (single, not adjacent to double bond, rotatable)\n- C-C (single, not adjacent to double bond, rotatable)\n- C-C (single, not adjacent to double bond, rotatable)\n- C-N (single, adjacent to double bond C=N, non-rotatable)\n\nSo three rotatable bonds.\n\nSimilarly, the thirteenth amide's side chain 'CCCNC(=N)N' also has three rotatable bonds.\n\nFor the other amides, where the side chain is a single bond to a ring or phenol, like 'CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O', the bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is a single bond not adjacent to a double bond, so rotatable. So each of those contributes one rotatable bond.\n\nSo let's recalculate:\n\nAmide 1: 3 rotatable bonds (N-C, C-C, C-C)\nAmide 13: 3 rotatable bonds\nAmides 2-12 (11 amides): 1 each\nTotal: 3+3+11=17\n\nBut the options are still not matching. Let's see.\n\nWait, the first amide's side chain is part of the main chain, not a side chain. The molecule is a long chain with multiple branches. Perhaps there are more carbon chains in the branches that contribute rotatable bonds.\n\nLet me try to parse the entire SMILES and identify all such chains.\n\nThe SMILES is:\n\nCC(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)C(=O)NC(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)NC(CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O)C(=O)NC(CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O)C(=O)NC(CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O)C(=O)NC(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N\n\nLet's break it down into segments separated by amide bonds:\n\n1. CC(=O)NC(...) → first amide\n2. ...C(=O)NC(...) → second amide\n3. ...C(=O)NC(...) → third amide\n4. ...C(=O)NC(...) → fourth amide\n5. ...C(=O)NC(...) → fifth amide\n6. ...C(=O)NC(...) → sixth amide\n7. ...C(=O)NC(...) → seventh amide\n8. ...C(=O)NC(...) → eighth amide\n9. ...C(=O)NC(...) → ninth amide\n10. ...C(=O)NC(...) → tenth amide\n11. ...C(=O)NC(...) → eleventh amide\n12. ...C(=O)NC(...) → twelfth amide\n13. ...C(=O)NC(...) → thirteenth amide\n14. ...C(=O)N → fourteenth amide\n\nNow, for each segment after the amide bond (C(=O)NC...), let's identify the carbon chain:\n\n1. After first amide: (CCCNC(=N)N) → this is a branch. The main chain continues with C(=O)NC...\n   - The branch is CCCNC(=N)N. As discussed, three rotatable bonds (N-C, C-C, C-C).\n\n2. After second amide: (CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O) → this forms a ring. The bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is single, not in ring, not adjacent to double bond → 1 rotatable bond.\n\n3. After third amide: (CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O) → phenol group. The bond between amide's C and the first C of the phenol chain is single, not adjacent to double bond → 1 rotatable bond.\n\n4. After fourth amide: (CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O) → ring. Bond between amide's C and ring's C is single, not adjacent to double bond → 1 rotatable bond.\n\n5. After fifth amide: (CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O) → phenol. Same as above, 1 rotatable bond.\n\n6. After sixth amide: (CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O) → ring. 1 rotatable bond.\n\n7. After seventh amide: (CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O) → ring. 1 rotatable bond.\n\n8. After eighth amide: (C(=O)NC(...) → wait, no, after eighth amide, it's connected to another part. Let me check the SMILES again.\n\nActually, the SMILES is continuous, so after each amide, the next part is connected. Let me list all the parts after each amide:\n\nAfter first amide: (CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC(...) → so the first amide is followed by CCCNC(=N)N, then the next amide.\n\nAfter second amide: (CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)C(=O)NC(...) → followed by CN1... then next amide.\n\nAfter third amide: (CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)NC(...) → followed by CC2... then next amide.\n\nAfter fourth amide: (CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O)C(=O)NC(...) → followed by CN3... then next amide.\n\nAfter fifth amide: (CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O)C(=O)NC(...) → followed by CC5... then next amide.\n\nAfter sixth amide: (CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O)C(=O)NC(...) → followed by CN6... then next amide.\n\nAfter seventh amide: (CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(...) → followed by CN7... then next amide.\n\nAfter eighth amide: (C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N) → wait, let me check the full SMILES again.\n\nActually, the full SMILES is:\n\nCC(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)C(=O)NC(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)NC(CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O)C(=O)NC(CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O)C(=O)NC(CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O)C(=O)NC(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N\n\nSo after the eighth amide, the next part is (CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(...) → followed by another amide.\n\nAfter the ninth amide: (CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N → the end.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nThe SMILES has 14 amide bonds. Let's list each part after each amide:\n\n1. After amide 1: (CCCNC(=N)N)\n2. After amide 2: (CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)\n3. After amide 3: (CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)\n4. After amide 4: (CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O)\n5. After amide 5: (CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O)\n6. After amide 6: (CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O)\n7. After amide 7: (CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)\n8. After amide 8: (C(=O)NC(...)) → another amide\n9. After amide 9: (CCCNC(=N)N)\n10. After amide 10: (C(=O)N) → end?\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to list each part after each amide bond:\n\nThe SMILES is a continuous chain with 14 amide bonds. Each amide bond is followed by a carbon chain or ring. For each of these, I need to determine the number of rotatable bonds in the following part.\n\nLet's start from the beginning:\n\n1. CC(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)NC(...) → after the first amide (C(=O)NC), the next part is (CCCNC(=N)N). This is a side chain with three C-C bonds (as discussed, three rotatable bonds: N-C, C-C, C-C).\n\n2. Then, C(=O)NC(CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O)... → after the second amide, the next part is (CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O), which forms a ring. The bond between the amide's C and the ring's C is single, not adjacent to double bond → 1 rotatable bond.\n\n3. C(=O)NC(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)... → after the third amide, the next part is (CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O), a phenol. The bond between amide's C and the first C of the phenol chain is single, not adjacent to double bond → 1 rotatable bond.\n\n4. C(=O)NC(CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O)... → after the fourth amide, the next part is (CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O), a ring. 1 rotatable bond.\n\n5. C(=O)NC(CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O)... → after the fifth amide, the next part is (CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O), a phenol. 1 rotatable bond.\n\n6. C(=O)NC(CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O)... → after the sixth amide, the next part is (CN6...), a ring. 1 rotatable bond.\n\n7. C(=O)NC(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)... → after the seventh amide, the next part is (CN7...), a ring. 1 rotatable bond.\n\n8. C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N... → after the eighth amide, the next part is (CCCNC(=N)N), a side chain with three C-C bonds (3 rotatable bonds: N-C, C-C, C-C).\n\n9. Then, the ninth amide is followed by the end of the chain, which is (CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N. Wait, let me see: the SMILES ends with ...C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N. So the ninth amide is followed by (CCCNC(=N)N), and then the tenth amide is followed by ...?\n\nActually, it's getting too complex to parse manually. Let me try to count the number of times a carbon chain (not in a ring) follows an amide bond, and how many rotatable bonds each has.\n\nFrom the SMILES, the side chains after amide bonds are:\n\n- Twice: 'CCCNC(=N)N' (after first and eighth amides) → each has three rotatable bonds (N-C, C-C, C-C)\n- Six times: rings (after amides 2,4,6,7,8, and possibly others) → each contributes 1 rotatable bond\n- Four times: phenol groups (after amides 3,5, and possibly others) → each contributes 1 rotatable bond\n\nBut I need to accurately count how many of each.\n\nLet me list all the parts after each amide:\n\n1. After amide 1: CCCNC(=N)N → 3 rotatable bonds\n2. After amide 2: CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O → 1 rotatable bond\n3. After amide 3: CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O → 1 rotatable bond\n4. After amide 4: CN3C(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4NC3=O → 1 rotatable bond\n5. After amide 5: CC5=CC=C(C=C5)O → 1 rotatable bond\n6. After amide 6: CN6C(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7NC6=O → 1 rotatable bond\n7. After amide 7: CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O → 1 rotatable bond\n8. After amide 8: CCCNC(=N)N → 3 rotatable bonds\n9. After amide 9: ? Let's see: the SMILES is ...C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N. So after amide 9, it's (CCCNC(=N)N), but wait, the SMILES is:\n\n...C(=O)NC(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N\n\nSo after amide 8: CN7... then amide 9 is followed by CCCNC(=N)N → 3 rotatable bonds.\n\nThen, after amide 9: C(=O)N, which is the end. So amide 9 is the thirteenth amide? Wait, I'm getting confused with the numbering.\n\nActually, the SMILES has 14 amide bonds. Let me try to number them properly:\n\n1. CC(=O)NC(...) → 1\n2. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 2\n3. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 3\n4. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 4\n5. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 5\n6. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 6\n7. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 7\n8. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 8\n9. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 9\n10. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 10\n11. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 11\n12. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 12\n13. ...C(=O)NC(...) → 13\n14. ...C(=O)N → 14\n\nNow, after each amide:\n\n1. After amide 1: CCCNC(=N)N → 3\n2. After amide 2: CN1... → 1\n3. After amide 3: CC2... → 1\n4. After amide 4: CN3... → 1\n5. After amide 5: CC5... → 1\n6. After amide 6: CN6... → 1\n7. After amide 7: CN7... → 1\n8. After amide 8: CCCNC(=N)N → 3\n9. After amide 9: ...C(=O)NC(...) → what's after amide 9? Let's see: the SMILES is:\n\n...C(=O)NC(CN7C(=O)C8=CC=CC=C8NC7=O)C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N\n\nSo after amide 8: CN7... → amide 9 is the next one, which is C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)..., so after amide 9: CCCNC(=N)N → 3 rotatable bonds.\n\n10. After amide 10: ...C(=O)N? Let's see: the SMILES continues as ...C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N. So after amide 9: CCCNC(=N)N, then amide 10 is C(=O)N...? Wait, the SMILES ends with ...C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N. So the last part is amide 13 followed by C(=O)N.\n\nThis is getting too complex, but let's proceed with the parts we can:\n\nAssuming that after amide 1, 8, and 9, there are CCCNC(=N)N parts, each contributing 3 rotatable bonds. Let's say there are three instances of 3 rotatable bonds (amide 1, 8, and 9), and the rest (11 amides) contribute 1 each. But this might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that there are two instances of CCCNC(=N)N (amide 1 and 8), each with 3 rotatable bonds, and the remaining 12 amides (2-13) contribute 1 each. But amide 13 is the last one followed by C(=O)N, so it might not contribute.\n\nIf there are two instances with 3 rotatable bonds and 11 instances with 1, total would be 2*3 + 11*1 = 6 + 11 = 17.\n\nBut the options are much higher, like 47, 49, etc. This suggests my approach is missing many rotatable bonds.\n\nPerhaps I'm undercounting the number of carbon chains in the side chains. For example, in the first side chain 'CCCNC(=N)N', there are three C-C bonds, but maybe there are more such chains in other parts.\n\nWait, the SMILES has multiple instances of 'CCCNC(=N)N', which is a three-carbon chain. Each of these would contribute two C-C bonds (since the first bond is N-C, then two C-C). But if there are multiple such chains, each contributing two C-C bonds, that adds up.\n\nLet me try to count all the carbon chains in the SMILES:\n\nLooking at the SMILES, the parts with carbon chains (not in rings) are:\n\n1. CCCNC(=N)N (after amide 1 and 8/9)\n2. Any other carbon chains?\n\nThe other parts are rings or phenols. So if there are two instances of CCCNC(=N)N, each contributing two C-C bonds (rotatable), and the other amides contribute one each, let's recalculate.\n\nBut if each CCCNC(=N)N has two C-C bonds (rotatable), and there are two such instances, that's 2*2 = 4. Plus the other amides contributing 1 each (12 amides), total 4 + 12 = 16. Still low.\n\nWait, the bond between N and the first C is also rotatable. So each CCCNC(=N)N has three rotatable bonds: N-C, C-C, C-C. If there are two such instances, that's 3*2=6. Plus 12 from other amides: 6+12=18.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nMaybe there are more carbon chains. Let me look for other carbon chains in the SMILES.\n\nThe SMILES has parts like 'CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O', which is a phenol with a single bond from the amide's C to the first C of the phenol chain. That's one rotatable bond.\n\nOther parts like 'CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O' are rings, no rotatable bonds in the ring.\n\nThe rest of the SMILES is mostly amide bonds and rings/phenols.\n\nSo, if there are two instances of CCCNC(=N)N (each with 3 rotatable bonds) and 12 other amides each with 1 rotatable bond, total is 3*2 + 12*1 = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\nBut the options are 47, 49, etc. This suggests I'm missing a lot of rotatable bonds.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that each carbon in the main chain between amide bonds is a rotatable bond. For example, in a linear peptide, each amide bond is followed by a Cα-C bond, which is rotatable. If there are 14 amide bonds, there are 13 such bonds in the main chain.\n\nBut in this molecule, the main chain is not linear due to the side chains and rings, but there might still be some linear parts.\n\nLet me try a different approach: use a tool or formula. Since I can't use external tools, I'll recall that the number of rotatable bonds in a peptide-like molecule can be estimated as the number of amide bonds minus the number of rings or branches that restrict rotation.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Given the options, and the complexity of the SMILES, the correct answer is likely one of the higher numbers. The options are 47, 49, 34, 65. Given that each amide bond (14) contributes at least one rotatable bond, and there are additional ones from the side chains, it's possible that the total is around 47-49.\n\nBut how to estimate? Let's think about the SMILES length. The SMILES has many 'C' characters. Each carbon in a chain adds to the number of rotatable bonds.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of single bonds not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nThe molecule has multiple amide bonds (C(=O)NC), each with a single bond between C and N (non-rotatable). The single bonds between carbons in the main chain and side chains that are not adjacent to double bonds or in rings are rotatable.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are 47, 49, 34, 65, and given that each amide bond (14) contributes at least one rotatable bond, and with additional ones from the side chains, 47 or 49 might be plausible.\n\nBut how to choose between them? Let's think about the number of carbon chains.\n\nThe first and eighth/ ninth amides have CCCNC(=N)N, which is three C's. Each of these adds two C-C bonds (rotatable). If there are two such instances, that's 2*2=4.\n\nOther amides have single bonds to rings or phenols, adding 1 each. If there are 12 such, that's 12.\n\nPlus the main chain between amide bonds: if there are 14 amide bonds, there are 13 bonds between them, but some are part of rings or adjacent to double bonds.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each 'CCC' in the SMILES adds two rotatable bonds. Let's count the number of 'CCC' sequences.\n\nLooking at the SMILES: 'CCCNC(=N)N' appears twice. Each has two C-C bonds. So 2*2=4.\n\nOther carbon chains: are there any other 'CC' or longer chains?\n\nThe SMILES has parts like 'CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O' which is a single bond from the amide's C to the first C of the phenol, but no other chains.\n\nSo total from CCC parts: 4.\n\nOther single bonds: for each amide, one rotatable bond, 14 amide bonds, but some of these bonds are part of the CCC chains.\n\nWait, no, the CCC chains are side chains, the main chain between amides may have other bonds.\n\nThis is too complex. Given the options and the structure, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since each amide bond (14) contributes at least one, and with additional from the side chains, 47 or 49 is likely. Given that the answer choices are close, and considering the two CCC parts add 2*2=4, plus 14 from amides, total 18, which is still low, but if there are more carbon chains, maybe each amide has more.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is 47, which is option A. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the SMILES: it has multiple CN1C=CC(=O)NC1=O, which are likely to be imidazole rings or similar, but each of these rings is connected via a single bond to the main chain, adding one rotatable bond each.\n\nIf there are, say, 7 such rings, adding 7, plus the two CCC parts adding 4, plus the main chain between amides adding 14-7=7, total 7+4+7=18. Still low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each carbon in the main chain between amide bonds is a rotatable bond. If there are 14 amide bonds, there are 13 bonds between them, but some are single bonds not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nFor example, in a typical peptide, each amide bond is followed by a Cα-C bond, which is rotatable. So 14 amide bonds would give 13 such bonds. Add the two CCC parts (each with two C-C bonds: 4), plus other side chains (like the phenol single bonds: say 6), total 13+4+6=23. Still low.\n\nGiven that the options are much higher, I must have missed a lot. Perhaps each carbon in the side chains contributes to rotatable bonds. For example, the first CCCNC(=N)N has three C-C bonds (two C-C and one N-C), but if there are multiple such chains, each with multiple C-C bonds, it adds up.\n\nIf there are, say, 10 such chains each with 2 C-C bonds, that's 20, plus 14 from amides, total 34, which is option C. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the options and the complexity, I'll go with option C:34, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, option B:49.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. The number of rotatable bonds in a molecule can be estimated by counting all single bonds not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nIn the given SMILES, let's count all single bonds:\n\n- Each 'C' in the SMILES is part of single or double bonds. But this is too complex to do manually.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in a peptide with n amino acids, there are n-1 rotatable bonds in the main chain. This molecule has 14 amide bonds, suggesting 14 amino acids, giving 13 rotatable bonds in the main chain. Add the side chains: each CCCNC(=N)N adds 2 C-C bonds (rotatable), and if there are two such, 4. Add the single bonds to rings/phenols: say 12 (one per amide). Total: 13+4+12=29. Still low.\n\nGiven the options, and if I have to choose, I'll go with option B:49, as it's higher and the molecule is very complex.\n</think>"}
