Let me read it again: A sound wave with frequency f travels through air at speed v. With what speed will a sound wave with frequency 4f travel through the air? The options are A: v/4, B: v, C: 2v, D: 4v. Hmm, right. So the question is asking how the speed of a sound wave changes when its frequency is quadrupled. \n\nFirst, I need to remember the relationship between the speed of a sound wave, its frequency, and its wavelength. I think the formula is something like speed equals frequency multiplied by wavelength. Let me recall... Oh right, the wave equation is v = f * λ, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. So the speed of a wave depends on both its frequency and wavelength. \n\nBut wait, in this question, they're talking about sound waves traveling through air. I remember that the speed of sound in a medium depends on the properties of that medium, like temperature, density, and elasticity. For example, sound travels faster in warmer air because the molecules are moving more vigorously and can transmit the vibrations more quickly. But here, the problem doesn't mention any change in the medium or temperature. It's just asking about changing the frequency of the sound wave. \n\nSo if the medium remains the same (air at the same temperature, I assume), then the speed of sound should remain constant, right? Because the speed is determined by the medium, not by the frequency or wavelength of the wave. That makes sense. For instance, different frequencies (like different musical notes) can travel through the air at the same time, and they all move at the same speed; otherwise, the sound would get distorted. So if you have a sound wave with a higher frequency, its wavelength must be shorter to keep the speed the same. \n\nLet me test that with the wave equation. If v = f * λ, then if the frequency increases, the wavelength must decrease proportionally to keep the speed constant. For example, if the frequency is doubled, the wavelength is halved. So in this case, if the original frequency is f and the speed is v, then the original wavelength λ would be v/f. If the frequency is increased to 4f, then the new wavelength λ' would be v/(4f), which is λ/4. Therefore, the speed remains v because v = (4f) * (λ/4) = f * λ, which is the original speed. \n\nSo the key point here is that the speed of sound in a given medium is independent of the frequency of the wave. Therefore, even if the frequency changes, as long as the medium is the same, the speed remains the same. Therefore, the answer should be B: v. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. Sometimes, in some contexts, like with light waves in different media, the speed can depend on the frequency, which leads to dispersion (like in prisms causing rainbows). But for sound waves in air, is there any dispersion? I think that for normal conditions, sound waves in air are non-dispersive, meaning that the speed doesn't depend on frequency. However, at very high frequencies or under certain conditions, there might be some dispersion, but I don't think that's considered here. The problem is probably assuming ideal or standard conditions where the medium is non-dispersive for sound. \n\nSo in this case, regardless of the frequency, the speed remains the same. Therefore, even if the frequency is 4f, the speed is still v. The change in frequency would only affect the wavelength, not the speed. \n\nLet me check another angle. Suppose someone might think that since frequency is higher, the particles are oscillating faster, so the wave moves faster. But actually, the speed of the wave is how fast the wavefronts propagate through the medium. The frequency is how often the particles oscillate, but the speed of propagation is determined by how quickly the disturbance is passed from one particle to the next, which is a property of the medium. \n\nSo even if the particles are vibrating more rapidly (higher frequency), the time it takes for the disturbance to move from one particle to the next (which relates to the speed) is still determined by the medium's properties. Therefore, changing the frequency doesn't change the speed. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be B: v. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
