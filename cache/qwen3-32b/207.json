I need to figure out how much time a high-speed train saves compared to a regular train when traveling from station W to G. The total distance is 1080 km, with 4 stations evenly distributed between W and G. Both trains have the same acceleration when entering and leaving stations, same maximum speeds, and same stopping time at each station. The question is asking for the time saved by taking the high-speed train.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 4 stations between W and G, so the total number of segments between stations would be... Let me think. If there are 4 stations in between, then starting from W, then first station, second, third, fourth, and then G. So that's 5 segments? Wait, between W and G, with 4 stations in between, so the total number of intervals is 5? Let me confirm. For example, if you have stations A, B, C between start and end, that's 3 stations in between, creating 4 intervals. So yes, with 4 stations in between, there are 5 segments. So each segment is 1080 km divided by 5, which is 216 km per segment. Let me check that: 1080 divided by 5 is indeed 216. So each segment between stations is 216 km.\n\nNow, the train departs from W, goes through each station, stops, and then arrives at G. So for each segment, the train will accelerate from rest to maximum speed, then maybe cruise at maximum speed, then decelerate to stop at the next station. But the problem says that the trains maintain their respective maximum speeds at other times, meaning except when accelerating or decelerating. Also, they have the same acceleration magnitude of 0.5 m/s² when entering and leaving stations. So I need to calculate the time taken for each segment, considering acceleration and deceleration, and the cruising time at maximum speed. Additionally, there is a stopping time at each station, which is the same for both trains. But since both trains have the same stopping time, maybe the difference in total time comes from the time taken on the track, not the stopping time? Wait, but the stopping time is the same for both trains, so when we calculate the difference between high-speed and regular trains, the stopping time might cancel out. Let me think.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\nFor each train (regular and high-speed):\n\nTotal time = sum of (time for each segment) + sum of (stopping time at each station)\n\nSince there are 4 stations between W and G, the train stops at 4 stations, so there are 4 stopping times. However, when departing from W, there's no stopping time, and arriving at G, maybe there's no stopping time? Wait, the problem says the train departs from W, stops at 4 stations, and arrives at G. So the stopping time is only at the 4 intermediate stations. Therefore, total stopping time is 4 * t_stop, where t_stop is the time spent stopped at each station. Since both trains have the same t_stop, when we take the difference in total time between high-speed and regular trains, the 4*t_stop terms will cancel. Therefore, the time saved is entirely due to the difference in travel time on the track.\n\nTherefore, I can focus on calculating the travel time for each segment for both trains, then multiply by 5 segments (since there are 5 segments), and subtract the two totals.\n\nSo first, let's compute for the regular train (max speed 108 km/h) and high-speed train (max speed 324 km/h). For each segment, we need to calculate the time taken to accelerate, cruise, and decelerate.\n\nBut first, let me convert units where necessary. The acceleration is given in m/s², and the speeds are in km/h. Let me convert the maximum speeds to m/s for consistency.\n\nRegular train max speed: 108 km/h. To convert to m/s, divide by 3.6. 108 / 3.6 = 30 m/s.\n\nHigh-speed train max speed: 324 km/h. 324 / 3.6 = 90 m/s.\n\nAcceleration is 0.5 m/s² for both when accelerating and decelerating. Assuming that when decelerating, the train also decelerates at 0.5 m/s². So the acceleration and deceleration phases are symmetrical.\n\nFor each segment, the train starts from rest, accelerates until reaching maximum speed, then if there's remaining distance, cruises at max speed, then decelerates to a stop. However, depending on the length of the segment and the acceleration/deceleration, it's possible that the train may not reach maximum speed during the segment. Therefore, we need to check for each train whether the segment length is sufficient for the train to reach its maximum speed.\n\nSo for each segment, let's calculate the distance required to accelerate to max speed and then decelerate to stop. If this distance is less than the segment length, then the train can reach max speed and cruise. Otherwise, the train will accelerate to some speed, then immediately decelerate to a stop without cruising.\n\nSo first, let's calculate for each train the distance required to accelerate to max speed and then decelerate.\n\nFor the regular train:\n\nMax speed v = 30 m/s, acceleration a = 0.5 m/s².\n\nTime to accelerate to max speed: t_acc = v / a = 30 / 0.5 = 60 seconds.\n\nDistance during acceleration: d_acc = 0.5 * a * t_acc² = 0.5 * 0.5 * (60)^2 = 0.25 * 3600 = 900 meters.\n\nSimilarly, the distance to decelerate is the same, since deceleration is same magnitude. So total distance for acceleration and deceleration is 2 * 900 m = 1800 m = 1.8 km.\n\nThe segment length is 216 km. Since 1.8 km is much less than 216 km, the regular train will definitely reach maximum speed during each segment. Therefore, the time for each segment is time to accelerate + time cruising + time to decelerate.\n\nSimilarly for the high-speed train:\n\nMax speed v = 90 m/s, acceleration a = 0.5 m/s².\n\nTime to accelerate to max speed: t_acc = 90 / 0.5 = 180 seconds.\n\nDistance during acceleration: d_acc = 0.5 * 0.5 * (180)^2 = 0.25 * 32400 = 8100 meters = 8.1 km.\n\nTotal distance for acceleration and deceleration: 2 * 8.1 km = 16.2 km.\n\nThe segment length is 216 km, so again, 16.2 km is much less than 216 km. Therefore, the high-speed train will also reach maximum speed during each segment. Therefore, similar to the regular train, the time per segment is time to accelerate, time cruising, time to decelerate.\n\nTherefore, for both trains, the time per segment can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime per segment = t_acc + t_cruise + t_dec. But since acceleration and deceleration times are same (t_acc = t_dec), total time for acceleration and deceleration is 2*t_acc. Then, the cruising time is (segment length - 2*d_acc)/v.\n\nSo let's compute for each train.\n\nFirst, regular train:\n\nSegment length: 216 km = 216,000 meters.\n\nDistance for acceleration and deceleration: 2 * 900 m = 1800 m.\n\nTherefore, cruising distance per segment: 216,000 - 1800 = 214,200 m.\n\nCruising time: 214,200 m / 30 m/s = let's calculate that.\n\n214,200 / 30 = 7,140 seconds.\n\nTime for acceleration and deceleration: 2 * t_acc = 2 * 60 = 120 seconds.\n\nTherefore, total time per segment for regular train: 7140 + 120 = 7260 seconds.\n\nSimilarly, for high-speed train:\n\nSegment length: 216,000 m.\n\nDistance for acceleration and deceleration: 2 * 8100 m = 16,200 m.\n\nCruising distance: 216,000 - 16,200 = 199,800 m.\n\nCruising speed: 90 m/s.\n\nCruising time: 199,800 / 90 = let's calculate that. 199,800 divided by 90. 90*2220 = 199,800. So 2220 seconds.\n\nTime for acceleration and deceleration: 2 * 180 = 360 seconds.\n\nTotal time per segment: 2220 + 360 = 2580 seconds.\n\nTherefore, for each segment, the regular train takes 7260 seconds, and the high-speed train takes 2580 seconds.\n\nNow, since there are 5 segments, total track time (excluding stopping time) for regular train is 5 * 7260 seconds, and for high-speed train is 5 * 2580 seconds.\n\nLet me compute these:\n\nRegular train total track time: 5 * 7260 = 36,300 seconds.\n\nHigh-speed train total track time: 5 * 2580 = 12,900 seconds.\n\nThe difference in track time is 36,300 - 12,900 = 23,400 seconds.\n\nConvert 23,400 seconds to hours:\n\n23,400 seconds divided by 3600 seconds per hour = 6.5 hours. 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. So 6 hours 30 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the answer options include 6h30m as option B. However, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the cruising time for regular train again:\n\nCruising distance was 214,200 m at 30 m/s. 214,200 / 30 = 7,140 seconds. Correct.\n\nAcceleration and deceleration time: 120 seconds. Total per segment 7260 seconds. Multiply by 5: 5*7260=36,300 seconds. Correct.\n\nHigh-speed train:\n\nCruising distance 199,800 m at 90 m/s. 199,800 / 90 = 2,220 seconds. Acceleration/deceleration time 360 seconds. Total per segment 2,580 seconds. Multiply by 5: 5*2,580=12,900 seconds. Correct.\n\nDifference 36,300 - 12,900 = 23,400 seconds. 23,400 / 3600 = 6.5 hours, which is 6 hours and 30 minutes. Therefore, the time saved is 6h30m, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the stopping time at each station being the same for both types of trains\". Earlier, I thought that since both have same stopping time, they cancel out when taking the difference. But maybe I need to check if there are any stopping times? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says the train departs from W, stops at 4 stations, and arrives at G. So the total number of stops is 4. At each stop, there is a stopping time. Therefore, total stopping time is 4*t_stop for both trains. However, since both trains have same t_stop, when we take the difference between total time for regular and high-speed trains, the 4*t_stop cancels out. Therefore, the difference in total time is only due to the track time difference, which we calculated as 6h30m. Therefore, the answer should be B) 6 hours 30 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let me check again if there's a mistake in my assumption that both trains can reach their maximum speed on each segment. For example, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the distance required for acceleration and deceleration?\n\nLet me check for regular train:\n\nAcceleration time t_acc = v/a = 30 / 0.5 = 60 s. Correct.\n\nDistance during acceleration: average speed is (0 + 30)/2 = 15 m/s * 60 s = 900 m. Correct. Similarly deceleration distance is same. Total 1.8 km. Segment is 216 km. So yes, plenty of distance. Similarly for high-speed train:\n\nt_acc = 90 / 0.5 = 180 s. Average speed during acceleration is 45 m/s * 180 s = 8100 m. Same for deceleration. Total 16.2 km. Segment is 216 km. So again, plenty of distance. So cruising is possible.\n\nTherefore, calculations seem correct. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let me convert the total track times to hours.\n\nRegular train total track time: 36,300 seconds. 36,300 / 3600 = 10.0833... hours. Which is 10 hours and 5 minutes (since 0.0833*60 ≈ 5 minutes). Wait, 0.0833 hours is 5 minutes? Wait 0.0833 * 60 ≈ 5 minutes. Yes.\n\nHigh-speed train total track time: 12,900 seconds. 12,900 / 3600 = 3.5833... hours, which is 3 hours and 35 minutes (0.5833*60 ≈ 35 minutes). Therefore, difference is 10h5m - 3h35m = 6h30m. Correct. So 6 hours and 30 minutes. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nBut wait, the options are (A) 6h25, (B) 6h30, (C) 6h35, (D) 6h40. So answer is B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nBut hold on, let me check once more for possible errors. For example, maybe I miscalculated the cruising time?\n\nRegular train cruising time per segment: 214,200 m / 30 m/s. Let me compute 214,200 divided by 30. 30*7000=210,000. 214,200 - 210,000 = 4,200. 4,200 / 30 = 140. Therefore total cruising time is 7000 + 140 = 7140 seconds. Correct. Then acceleration and deceleration time is 120 seconds. Total per segment 7260 seconds. Multiply by 5: 36,300. Correct.\n\nHigh-speed train: cruising distance per segment 199,800 m / 90 m/s. Let me compute 199,800 / 90. 90*2000=180,000. 199,800 - 180,000 = 19,800. 19,800 / 90 = 220. So total cruising time is 2000 + 220 = 2220 seconds. Acceleration and deceleration time 360 seconds. Total per segment 2580 seconds. Multiply by 5: 5*2580 = 12,900. Correct.\n\nDifference 36,300 - 12,900 = 23,400 seconds. 23,400 divided by 3600 is 6.5 hours. 6 hours and 30 minutes. So answer is B. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's an error in segment length. The problem says 4 stations evenly distributed between W and G. So total number of stations including W and G? No, the problem says \"4 stations evenly distributed between W and G\". So between W and G, there are 4 stations, making the total number of intervals 5. So each interval is 1080 / 5 = 216 km. Correct. So that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that between W and G there are 4 stations, so W, then station 1, station 2, station 3, station 4, then G. Therefore, 5 intervals. Correct.\n\nTherefore, calculations are correct. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me check another angle. Suppose someone thought that the stopping time is included? But since stopping time is same for both trains, the difference would still be 6h30m. Suppose stopping time is, say, t per station. Then total time for regular train would be 36,300 + 4t, and for high-speed train 12,900 + 4t. The difference is still 23,400 seconds. Therefore, regardless of stopping time, the difference is 6.5 hours. Therefore, answer is B.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
