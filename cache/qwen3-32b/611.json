Hmm, let me recall what I know about waveguides and electromagnetic boundary conditions. \n\nFirst, waveguides are structures that guide electromagnetic waves, typically in the microwave region. They can be rectangular, circular, etc., but since the question mentions x=0, a and y=0, b, I think it's referring to a rectangular waveguide. The walls of the waveguide are usually made of a perfect conductor, right? So, the boundary conditions would be based on the properties of a perfect conductor.\n\nNow, boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields at the surface of a perfect conductor... I remember that for a perfect conductor, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and the tangential component of the electric field must be continuous across the boundary. But since inside the conductor it's zero, the tangential component of the electric field outside (in the waveguide) must also be zero. So, the tangential E is zero at the walls.\n\nBut the question is about the magnetic field H. What are the boundary conditions for H? Let me think. The boundary conditions for H involve the tangential components as well. The tangential component of H is related to the surface current density, but in the case of a perfect conductor, there can't be any surface current because the electric field inside is zero. Wait, no, actually, if there is a time-varying magnetic field, there could be induced currents. But in the case of a perfect conductor, the electric field inside is zero, so maybe the surface currents are determined by the discontinuity in H?\n\nThe general boundary condition for the magnetic field is that the tangential component of H is equal to the surface current density K. But since the conductor is perfect, and assuming there are no free surface currents (which is usually the case unless specified otherwise), then the tangential component of H should be continuous? Wait, no. Wait, the boundary condition for H is that the tangential component of H has a discontinuity equal to the surface current. So, if there is no surface current, then the tangential component of H is continuous. However, in the case of a perfect conductor, the tangential E field must be zero. \n\nBut how does this relate to H? Let me recall Maxwell's equations. For a perfect conductor, the electric field inside is zero. So, at the boundary between the conductor and the waveguide's interior (which is usually air or some dielectric), the tangential E must be zero. \n\nBut how does that affect H? Let me think about the boundary conditions. The boundary conditions for the magnetic field H are derived from Ampère's law with Maxwell's correction. The tangential component of H is discontinuous by the surface current K. If there is no surface current, then the tangential H is continuous. However, in the case of a perfect conductor, there might be surface currents induced by the magnetic field. But if we are considering the fields in the waveguide, perhaps we need to relate the H field's behavior at the boundary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the boundary conditions for B, the magnetic flux density. Since B is related to H by the permeability. In a perfect conductor, assuming it's linear and isotropic, B would still have to satisfy the boundary conditions. The normal component of B is continuous across the boundary. However, since the conductor is perfect, and assuming it's a perfect electric conductor (PEC), but magnetic properties? Wait, usually PECs are considered to have infinite conductivity but they don't necessarily have any special magnetic properties unless specified. So, assuming that the waveguide walls are perfect conductors with μ (permeability) equal to that of free space, or maybe some other value? Hmm.\n\nBut maybe I need to focus on the H field. Let me recall the boundary conditions:\n\nFor the magnetic field H:\n\nThe tangential component of H is discontinuous by the surface current density K: (H_above - H_below) × n = K, where n is the normal vector pointing from below to above.\n\nIn the case of a perfect conductor, if there are no free surface currents (which is typically the case unless there's an impressed current), then the tangential component of H is continuous? Wait, but in reality, when you have a perfect conductor, there can be surface currents induced by the magnetic field. However, in the case of waveguides, we usually don't have impressed surface currents, so maybe the tangential component of H is continuous?\n\nBut wait, in the case of a perfect conductor, since the electric field inside is zero, we can use the other boundary condition for E to find something about H. For instance, using Maxwell's equations. Let me think about that.\n\nOne of Maxwell's equations is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. At the boundary, if the tangential E is zero, then maybe this relates to the H field?\n\nAlternatively, consider the boundary conditions for E and H. For a perfect conductor:\n\n1. The tangential component of E is zero.\n2. The normal component of B is continuous.\n3. The tangential component of H is related to surface current.\n\nBut since inside the conductor, E is zero, and assuming no surface current (K=0), then the tangential component of H outside must equal the tangential component of H inside. But inside the perfect conductor, what is H? There's no restriction on H inside a perfect conductor. Wait, but for a perfect conductor, the magnetic field can exist, but there's no electric field. So, if there is no surface current, then the tangential H is continuous. Therefore, if inside the conductor H is something, but outside it's our waveguide field. However, if there is no surface current, then H_tangential_inside = H_tangential_outside. But what is H inside the conductor?\n\nActually, in the case of a perfect conductor, there's no restriction on the magnetic field. However, in reality, for a waveguide, the fields are set up such that they satisfy the boundary conditions. Since there is no surface current, then H_tangential is continuous across the boundary. But inside the conductor, since we don't care about the fields inside (because we are only concerned with the fields in the waveguide), but if H_tangential_inside is equal to H_tangential_outside, and if we don't have any information about H inside, maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use the fact that the tangential E is zero. Let me recall that another Maxwell equation is ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t. Inside the conductor, since it's a perfect conductor, the electric field is zero, so J is infinite? Wait, no. For a perfect conductor, the electric field is zero, so Ohm's law J = σ E would imply that J is zero? Wait, no. Ohm's law is J = σ E. If σ is infinite and E is zero, then J could be finite? Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me think about specific boundary conditions for TE and TM modes, since waveguides support these modes. For example, in a TE (Transverse Electric) mode, the electric field is entirely transverse, meaning there is no component along the direction of propagation (usually the z-axis). In this case, the magnetic field has a component along the direction of propagation. The boundary conditions would then impose certain conditions on the magnetic field components.\n\nAlternatively, for TM (Transverse Magnetic) modes, the magnetic field is entirely transverse, and the electric field has a component along the direction of propagation.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to get into specific modes. The question is about general boundary conditions for H at the walls. Let me think again about the general boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the magnetic field H at a conductor surface:\n\nSince the conductor is perfect, the electric field inside is zero. Therefore, the tangential component of E outside must be zero. From Faraday's law, ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If the tangential E is zero, then maybe this implies something about the H field?\n\nAlternatively, consider the boundary conditions for the magnetic field. The tangential component of H is equal to the surface current density. If there is no surface current, then the tangential component of H is continuous. However, in the case of a perfect conductor, there might be surface currents induced. But if we assume there are no free surface currents, then the tangential H is continuous. However, inside the conductor, we don't know H. But if we assume that the fields inside the conductor decay rapidly (as they would in a good conductor), maybe we can approximate that the tangential H outside is equal to something?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the fact that the tangential E is zero. Let me recall that the boundary condition for E: the tangential component is continuous. Since inside the conductor E is zero, then the tangential component of E outside is also zero. So, E_tangential = 0.\n\nNow, using Maxwell's equations, specifically Ampère's law with Maxwell's correction:\n\n∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t.\n\nAt the boundary, if we consider a surface current J_s (which is a surface current density), then the discontinuity in H is equal to J_s. However, in the absence of surface currents, the tangential component of H is continuous. However, in a perfect conductor, there can be surface currents induced. But unless there is an external source for these currents, they would be related to the fields.\n\nBut perhaps in the case of a waveguide, we are assuming that there are no free surface currents, so the discontinuity in H is zero. Therefore, the tangential component of H is continuous across the boundary. However, inside the conductor, what is H? Well, if there's no current inside the conductor (since E is zero, and J = σ E, which would be zero if E is zero?), then ∇ × H = 0 + ∂D/∂t. But inside the conductor, D is ε E, which is zero. Therefore, ∇ × H = 0 inside the conductor. So, H is irrotational inside the conductor. But without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the boundary condition for B. The normal component of B is continuous. Since B = μ H, assuming linear media, then the normal component of H would have a discontinuity if μ changes. However, if the waveguide walls are made of a material with permeability μ, which might be different from the permeability inside the waveguide (usually μ₀), then the normal component of B is continuous. But if the conductor is a perfect conductor, does that affect μ? Typically, for PECs, we assume that μ is the same as the surrounding medium unless specified otherwise. So, assuming μ is continuous, then the normal component of H is continuous.\n\nBut this is for B. However, if μ is different inside and outside, then the normal component of H would have a discontinuity. But since the walls are conductors, which are usually non-magnetic, so μ is μ₀ both inside and outside. Therefore, the normal component of H is continuous.\n\nBut how does that help me? The question is about the boundary conditions for H at the walls. So, summarizing:\n\nFor a perfect conductor boundary:\n\n1. Tangential E = 0.\n2. Normal component of B is continuous ⇒ Normal component of H is continuous if μ is continuous.\n3. Tangential component of H has a discontinuity equal to surface current K. If no surface current, then tangential H is continuous.\n\nBut in the case of a waveguide, there are no surface currents (unless there are currents deliberately placed there, which is not typical). Therefore, both the tangential and normal components of H are continuous? Wait, no. Wait, the tangential component of H is continuous if there is no surface current, and the normal component of H is continuous if μ is continuous. But in reality, the boundary conditions for H are:\n\nThe tangential component of H is discontinuous by K, and the normal component of H is discontinuous if there is a surface magnetic charge, which there isn't in this case. Wait, no. The normal component of B is continuous, and since B = μ H, if μ is the same on both sides, then normal component of H is continuous. If μ is different, then H_normal would have a discontinuity.\n\nBut assuming μ is the same (μ₀), then H_normal is continuous.\n\nBut how does this relate to the waveguide walls? The question is about the boundary conditions that H satisfies. So, if there is no surface current, then the tangential component of H is continuous. But inside the conductor, what is H? If there's no current inside the conductor (since E is zero and J = σ E is zero?), then ∇ × H = ∂D/∂t. But inside the conductor, E is zero, so D is zero, hence ∂D/∂t is zero. Therefore, ∇ × H = 0 inside the conductor. Therefore, H is irrotational inside the conductor. However, without knowing the exact fields inside, maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about specific components. Let's consider the waveguide walls at x=0 and x=a. Let's take the wall at x=0. The normal vector at this wall is in the x-direction. So, for the boundary conditions, we need to consider the tangential components of H. The tangential components would be in the y and z directions (assuming the waveguide is along the z-axis). Similarly, for the walls at y=0 and y=b, the normal vector is in the y-direction, so the tangential components are in x and z directions.\n\nTherefore, the boundary condition would require that the tangential components of H are continuous across the boundary. However, since inside the conductor we don't have information about H, but if we assume that there is no surface current, then H_tangential outside must equal H_tangential inside. But since we don't care about the fields inside the conductor, maybe we need another approach.\n\nWait, but if we use the fact that the tangential E is zero, can we relate that to H? Let's consider Faraday's law in integral form around a small loop that straddles the boundary. For example, take a rectangular loop with one side inside the conductor and one side outside, very close to the boundary. The tangential E around this loop must satisfy ∮ E · dl = -d/dt ∫ B · dA. Since the loop is very small, the area integral of B is negligible, so ∮ E · dl ≈ 0. But since the tangential E outside is zero and inside is also zero (because E inside conductor is zero), this condition is satisfied. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider Ampère's law for a similar loop. ∮ H · dl = I_enc + ∫ ∂D/∂t · dA. If there is no surface current and the loop is very small, then I_enc is zero (assuming no volume current). If the loop is in the plane perpendicular to the wall, then maybe we can relate the tangential components of H. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: for the waveguide, the fields must satisfy the boundary conditions. For TM modes, the magnetic field is transverse, so H_z = 0. For TE modes, the electric field is transverse, so E_z = 0. But regardless of the mode, the boundary conditions for H would depend on the tangential components.\n\nBut let's think of specific components. Suppose we have a rectangular waveguide with walls at x=0, x=a, y=0, y=b. Let me consider the wall at x=0. The normal vector here is in the +x direction. The tangential directions are y and z. Therefore, the boundary condition for H would be that the tangential components of H (H_y and H_z) are continuous across the boundary. However, since inside the conductor, we don't know H, but if we assume that there are no surface currents, then H_tangential outside must equal H_tangential inside. But since the fields inside the conductor are not part of the waveguide problem, maybe we need to impose that the tangential H is such that it doesn't produce a surface current? Or perhaps, since there's no surface current, the tangential H is continuous, but since inside the conductor H could be something else, but we don't have information. However, in the absence of surface currents, the discontinuity is zero, so the tangential component of H is continuous. Therefore, if we can argue that the tangential component of H at the boundary must be zero?\n\nWait, why would it be zero? If H_tangential outside equals H_tangential inside, but inside the conductor, what is H? There's no restriction on H inside the conductor. However, if we consider that the fields in the waveguide must satisfy certain conditions, perhaps we need another relation.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For a perfect conductor, since the electric field is zero inside, we can use the boundary condition for E to find something about H. Let me recall that one of the Maxwell equations is ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t. Inside the conductor, E=0, so J = σ E = 0? Wait, no. For a perfect conductor, σ is infinite, but E is zero. So J = σ E is 0 * ∞, which is indeterminate. Therefore, we need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider the boundary condition between the conductor and the waveguide. At the surface, the tangential E is zero. Let me use the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t. If I take the surface to be at x=0, and consider the limit as we approach the surface from outside, then maybe we can relate H to E?\n\nAlternatively, consider the boundary condition for the electric field. Since E_tangential is zero, and using the Maxwell equation ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If I take a small loop in the plane perpendicular to the wall, then the integral of E around the loop is zero (since E is zero on one side and we take the limit as the loop becomes very small). Therefore, the integral of ∂B/∂t over the area of the loop is zero. In the limit of a very small loop, this suggests that the derivative of B is zero at the boundary? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the components. Let me write down the boundary conditions more formally.\n\nFor a perfect conductor boundary, the following hold:\n\n1. E_tangential = 0.\n2. B_normal = 0? No, B_normal is continuous. Wait, if the conductor has finite permeability, then B_normal is continuous. However, if the conductor is a perfect conductor, does that affect B? Not necessarily. Unless it's a superconductor, which expels magnetic fields (Meissner effect), but regular perfect conductors don't do that. So, assuming it's a perfect conductor but not a superconductor, then B_normal is continuous. Therefore, if outside the waveguide, there is a magnetic field, then inside the conductor, there is also B such that the normal component is continuous.\n\nBut again, not sure how this helps with H.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. In waveguides, the fields must satisfy the wave equation derived from Maxwell's equations. For the magnetic field, in a source-free region (no free currents or charges), Maxwell's equations give us:\n\n∇ × E = -μ ∂H/∂t\n\n∇ × H = ε ∂E/∂t\n\nAnd the boundary conditions. If we assume that the waveguide is filled with a homogeneous, isotropic, linear medium (like air), then μ and ε are constants.\n\nNow, considering the boundary conditions at the walls. Since the walls are perfect conductors, E_tangential = 0. Let's consider TE modes first, where E_z = 0. In this case, the magnetic field has a z-component. For TE modes, the electric field is purely transverse, and the magnetic field has both transverse and longitudinal components.\n\nThe boundary condition for TE modes would require that the tangential components of E are zero. However, for H, since there is no surface current, the tangential component of H is continuous. But since we don't have information about the fields inside the conductor, maybe we need to relate it to the E field?\n\nAlternatively, for TM modes, where H_z = 0, and E has a longitudinal component. The boundary condition would again require E_tangential = 0. \n\nBut perhaps I need to think about specific components. Let me take the wall at x=0. The normal vector is in the x-direction. The tangential directions are y and z. Therefore, the boundary condition for the magnetic field would involve the tangential components H_y and H_z.\n\nBut since there is no surface current, the discontinuity in the tangential H is zero. Therefore, the tangential components of H must be continuous across the boundary. However, since inside the conductor, we don't know H, but if we assume that the fields in the waveguide are such that they don't produce surface currents, then the tangential H outside must equal the tangential H inside. But since we don't care about the fields inside, perhaps this isn't helpful.\n\nWait, but if we consider that the fields in the waveguide must satisfy certain conditions due to the perfect conductor. For example, in TE modes, since E_tangential is zero, we can derive the boundary conditions for H. Let me try that.\n\nFor TE modes, E_z = 0, and the electric field has components in x and y. The magnetic field has components in x, y, and z. The boundary condition E_tangential = 0 implies that at x=0, E_x = 0 and E_y = 0. How does this relate to H?\n\nUsing the Maxwell equation ∇ × E = -μ ∂H/∂t. Let me write this out for TE modes. Suppose the wave is propagating in the z-direction. Then, the electric field has no z-component, and the magnetic field has a z-component. \n\nFor example, the z-component of the magnetic field, H_z, satisfies certain boundary conditions. Let me recall that for TE modes, the electric field components can be expressed in terms of H_z. \n\nSpecifically, for TE modes:\n\nE_x = -j ω μ / (k² - k_z²) * ∂H_z/∂y\n\nE_y = j ω μ / (k² - k_z²) * ∂H_z/∂x\n\nWhere k is the propagation constant, etc. \n\nBut at the boundary x=0, E_x and E_y must be zero. Therefore:\n\nAt x=0: ∂H_z/∂x = 0 (since E_y is proportional to this derivative and must be zero)\n\nSimilarly, at y=0: ∂H_z/∂y = 0 (since E_x is proportional to this derivative and must be zero)\n\nTherefore, for TE modes, the derivative of H_z with respect to the normal direction (x or y) must be zero at the walls. This implies that H_z has a maximum or minimum at the walls, i.e., it satisfies a Neumann boundary condition.\n\nSimilarly, for TM modes, where H_z = 0, the magnetic field components are derived from the electric field, which has a longitudinal component. The boundary conditions for TM modes would involve the magnetic field's tangential components.\n\nBut the question isn't specific to TE or TM modes; it's about the general boundary conditions for H. However, from the TE mode example, we see that the derivative of H_z with respect to the normal direction is zero at the walls. This is a specific boundary condition for H_z. \n\nBut is this generalizable? For other components of H?\n\nLet me think. In general, for the magnetic field, the boundary conditions depend on the type of mode, but perhaps there's a general condition. Since the tangential E is zero, and using Maxwell's equations, we might derive conditions on H.\n\nLet me consider a general case. Suppose we have a boundary at x=0. The tangential components of E are zero. Let me take the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t. At the boundary, assuming no surface current (J=0), then ∇ × H = ∂D/∂t. However, if I take the limit as we approach the boundary from the outside, and consider the components of ∇ × H.\n\nBut maybe this is too abstract. Let me take specific components. Suppose we are at x=0. Let's consider the y-component of the curl of H. The y-component of ∇ × H is:\n\n∂H_z/∂x - ∂H_x/∂z = J_y + ∂D_y/∂t\n\nBut at x=0, approaching from the outside, and assuming that the fields are propagating in the z-direction (as in a waveguide), then for a time-harmonic wave, we can write H_x and H_z as functions of x, y, and e^{j(kz - ωt)}. \n\nAssuming a time-harmonic field, ∂/∂t = -jω, and ∂/∂z = jk_z. \n\nLet me assume that H_x and H_z vary as e^{j(k_z z - ωt)}. Then, their derivatives with respect to z would involve multiplying by jk_z. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to recall that in a waveguide, the fields satisfy the Helmholtz equation. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the boundary condition for H in terms of its normal derivative. From the TE mode example, we saw that the derivative of H_z with respect to the normal direction is zero. Is this a general condition?\n\nFor the general magnetic field, if we consider that the tangential E is zero, which for a perfect conductor implies that the fields satisfy certain conditions. For example, if we look at the Maxwell equation ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If E is zero inside the conductor, then near the boundary, the curl of E (which is zero on one side) must equal -∂B/∂t. Integrating around a small loop, as before, suggests that ∂B/∂t is zero? Not necessarily, because the area over which we integrate is shrinking.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the electric field is zero at the boundary, so for the Maxwell equation ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t, if E is zero, then ∇ × E = 0 = -∂B/∂t ⇒ ∂B/∂t = 0? But that would imply that B is static, which is not the case in a waveguide where we have time-varying fields. Therefore, this approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept that for a perfect conductor, the boundary condition for the magnetic field is that the tangential component of H is continuous, and since there's no surface current, it's equal to the tangential component inside. But since we don't have information about the inside, we can't say more. However, in the case of waveguides, the fields must satisfy certain conditions due to the boundary conditions on E. \n\nFor example, in the TE mode case, we derived that the derivative of H_z with respect to the normal direction is zero. Similarly, for other components? Maybe for other components of H, there are similar conditions.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that at the boundary, since the tangential E is zero, the magnetic field must be such that it doesn't produce a tangential E. From the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t. If we consider the components of this equation at the boundary, maybe we can find something.\n\nLet me try again with specific components. Take the wall at x=0, normal in x-direction. Consider the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = ∂D/∂t (assuming no free currents). Let's write out the components of ∇ × H.\n\nThe curl of H in Cartesian coordinates is:\n\n(∂H_z/∂y - ∂H_y/∂z, ∂H_x/∂z - ∂H_z/∂x, ∂H_y/∂x - ∂H_x/∂y) = ( ∂D_x/∂t, ∂D_y/∂t, ∂D_z/∂t )\n\nAt the boundary x=0, let's look at the y-component of the curl, which is ∂H_x/∂z - ∂H_z/∂x = ∂D_y/∂t.\n\nBut at x=0, approaching from the outside, we can consider the limit. If we assume that the fields are propagating in the z-direction, then H_x and H_z may have dependencies on x and z. However, without knowing the exact form of the fields, it's hard to proceed.\n\nBut if we consider that at x=0, the tangential E is zero, which for TE modes relates to the derivatives of H_z, maybe there's a general condition here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for the electric field to be zero tangentially at the boundary, the magnetic field must satisfy certain conditions. For example, in TE modes, the derivative of H_z with respect to the normal is zero. For TM modes, the tangential H is related to the electric field, which has to satisfy boundary conditions.\n\nBut this seems too specific. The question is about general boundary conditions for H, not specific to TE or TM modes.\n\nWait, let me check some references in my mind. I recall that for a perfect electric conductor (PEC), the boundary conditions for the magnetic field are that the tangential component of H is equal to the surface current density. Since there are no surface currents in a standard waveguide problem, the tangential component of H is continuous. However, since inside the conductor we don't have information about H, this might not give us a direct condition on H in the waveguide. But perhaps, in combination with the other Maxwell equations, we can derive a condition.\n\nBut if there's no surface current, then the tangential component of H is continuous. However, since inside the conductor H could be anything, but we don't care about it. Therefore, the only condition we can impose is that the tangential component of H is continuous. But since we don't know the inside value, this doesn't give us a condition on H in the waveguide. Hence, maybe this approach is not helpful.\n\nWait, but if we consider that the fields in the waveguide must satisfy Maxwell's equations in the region outside the conductor (the waveguide's interior), and that at the boundary, the tangential E is zero, which imposes conditions on the fields.\n\nFor example, consider the electric field boundary condition E_tangential = 0. For a waveguide mode, this would impose that certain components of E are zero at the boundary, which in turn, through Maxwell's equations, would impose conditions on H.\n\nLet me try with a general case. Suppose we have a magnetic field H in the waveguide. At the boundary x=0, the tangential components of E are zero. From Faraday's law, ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If I take the limit as we approach the boundary from the outside, and consider the components of E and B.\n\nBut since E is tangential and zero at the boundary, the curl of E involves derivatives of E. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t. At the boundary, if there is no surface current, then the discontinuity in H_tangential is zero. So, the tangential component of H is continuous. But again, this doesn't give a condition unless we know something about the inside.\n\nWait, but if we assume that the fields inside the conductor are such that they don't contribute to the discontinuity, then perhaps the condition is that the tangential component of H is continuous, which means that the tangential component of H in the waveguide must satisfy certain conditions. But since we don't know the inside, maybe this is not helpful.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the fact that the magnetic field lines must be such that they don't have a discontinuity in tangential component. For example, in the case of a perfect conductor, the magnetic field lines would be parallel to the surface? No, that's not necessarily true. For example, in a waveguide, the magnetic field can have components both parallel and perpendicular to the surface.\n\nWait, let's think about the normal component of H. Since the normal component of B is continuous, and assuming μ is the same on both sides, the normal component of H is continuous. Therefore, at the boundary, the normal component of H is the same inside and outside. But inside the conductor, what is H? If the conductor is a perfect conductor, and there's no current, then ∇ × H = ∂D/∂t. Inside the conductor, E=0, so D=0, hence ∂D/∂t=0. Therefore, ∇ × H = 0 inside the conductor. So, H is irrotational inside the conductor. If we also assume that there are no sources at infinity, then H inside the conductor might be zero? Not necessarily, but without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nIf we assume that H inside the conductor is zero, then the normal component of H outside must also be zero (since it's continuous). Therefore, the normal component of H at the boundary is zero. But is this a valid assumption?\n\nThis seems like a big assumption. Why would H inside the conductor be zero? Because if there's no current and no time-varying electric field, but in reality, the fields in the waveguide are time-varying, so ∂D/∂t might not be zero. Wait, inside the conductor, D=ε E, and E=0, so D=0. Hence, ∂D/∂t=0. Therefore, ∇ × H = 0 inside the conductor. So, H is irrotational. If we also assume that there are no magnetic monopoles and that the fields decay rapidly inside the conductor (which they do in good conductors due to skin effect), then perhaps H inside the conductor is zero. Therefore, the normal component of H outside is zero. Hence, at the boundary, the normal component of H is zero.\n\nIf that is the case, then at the boundary, both the normal component of H is zero, and the tangential component of H is continuous (which would be equal to zero if H inside is zero). Wait, if H inside is zero, then the tangential component of H outside is also zero (since it's continuous). Therefore, both the normal and tangential components of H are zero at the boundary? That would mean H=0 at the boundary, which seems too restrictive.\n\nBut this can't be right, because in a waveguide, the magnetic field doesn't have to be zero at the walls. For example, in TE modes, the magnetic field has a longitudinal component which is not zero at the walls, but its derivative with respect to the normal is zero.\n\nWait, this suggests that my assumption that H inside the conductor is zero is incorrect. Because if H inside is zero, then the tangential component of H outside is zero, which would impose H_tangential = 0 at the boundary. But in TE modes, H_z is non-zero at the boundary, and its derivative with respect to the normal is zero, not H itself.\n\nTherefore, my previous assumption is wrong. Let me backtrack. If ∇ × H = 0 inside the conductor, and assuming that H decays rapidly inside the conductor (which it does in good conductors), then H inside the conductor is not necessarily zero, but it's such that its curl is zero. Therefore, H inside is a conservative field. If there are no magnetic charges, then ∇ · B = 0, which implies ∇ · (μ H) = 0. Assuming μ is constant, ∇ · H = 0. So, inside the conductor, H is both irrotational (∇ × H = 0) and divergence-free (∇ · H = 0). Therefore, H satisfies Laplace's equation inside the conductor: ∇² H = 0. The solution to this equation with boundary conditions at infinity (assuming no external fields) would be H = 0. But if there are fields from the waveguide, then H inside the conductor would be determined by the boundary conditions at the surface.\n\nHowever, since we don't have information about the fields at infinity, this is not helpful. Therefore, this line of reasoning is not leading me anywhere.\n\nLet me try to look for another approach. In many textbooks, the boundary conditions for waveguides are derived based on the requirement that the electric field is zero at the conducting walls. For example, in a rectangular waveguide, the electric field must be tangential zero at the walls, which leads to certain conditions on the field components. For the magnetic field, since there's no surface current, the tangential component of H is continuous. However, since inside the conductor we don't have information about H, but if we assume that the fields inside the conductor are such that they don't contribute to the discontinuity, then the tangential component of H in the waveguide must satisfy certain conditions. But without knowing the inside, this is ambiguous.\n\nWait, here's a thought. If we consider that the waveguide is a hollow conductor, and we are solving for the fields inside the waveguide, then the boundary conditions are applied at the surface of the conductor. The fields inside the conductor are not part of the solution, so we only need to ensure that the fields we find in the waveguide satisfy the boundary conditions. For the magnetic field, this would mean that the tangential component of H is continuous, but since inside the conductor we don't know H, we can't say anything about it. However, in practice, for the fields inside the waveguide, we can derive conditions based on the other Maxwell equations and the known boundary conditions on E.\n\nFor example, in TE modes, we derived that the derivative of H_z with respect to the normal is zero. This is a condition that comes from the requirement that E_tangential is zero. Similarly, for other components of H, there may be similar conditions.\n\nTherefore, the general boundary conditions for H at the waveguide walls are derived from the requirement that the tangential E is zero, combined with Maxwell's equations. For each component of H, this would impose a condition on its derivative or value at the boundary.\n\nFor example, at x=0, the boundary condition for H might involve the derivative of H with respect to x being zero, similar to the TE mode case. But to generalize this, I need to think about how the boundary conditions on E translate to conditions on H.\n\nLet me try to derive this. Consider the boundary condition E_tangential = 0 at x=0. Let's take a component of E, say E_y, which is tangential at x=0. From Maxwell's equations, we can express E in terms of H. For example, using Faraday's law:\n\n∇ × E = -∂B/∂t\n\nOr in time-harmonic form, ∇ × E = jωμ H.\n\nIf I solve for E, I can express it in terms of H. Let's suppose we have a general expression for E in terms of H. At the boundary x=0, E_y = 0. This would give an equation involving H, which can be solved to find a boundary condition on H.\n\nLet me write out the components of ∇ × E = jωμ H.\n\nThe curl of E is:\n\n(∂E_z/∂y - ∂E_y/∂z, ∂E_x/∂z - ∂E_z/∂x, ∂E_y/∂x - ∂E_x/∂y) = jωμ (H_x, H_y, H_z)\n\nAt x=0, let's look at the z-component of this equation, which is ∂E_y/∂x - ∂E_x/∂y = jωμ H_z.\n\nIf at x=0, E_y = 0, then if we take the derivative of E_y with respect to x at x=0, it must be related to the other terms. However, without knowing E_x, this is difficult. But if we assume that the fields are such that ∂E_x/∂y is known or can be related to other quantities, maybe we can find a condition on H_z.\n\nAlternatively, consider that at x=0, E_y = 0. If we take the derivative of E_y with respect to x, and assume that the fields are continuous across the boundary (except for the discontinuities allowed by boundary conditions), then maybe this derivative is related to H.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Let me think about specific cases again. For TE modes, we had that ∂H_z/∂x = 0 at x=0. For TM modes, where H_z = 0, the boundary conditions would involve the electric field, which has a longitudinal component. In this case, the magnetic field components are derived from the electric field, and the boundary conditions on E would translate to conditions on H.\n\nFor example, in TM modes, the magnetic field has no z-component, and the electric field has a z-component. The boundary condition E_z = 0 at the walls (since E_tangential is zero, but E_z is normal? Wait, no. In TM modes, E has a longitudinal component (along z), and the tangential components of E are not necessarily zero. Wait, no. For TM modes, the magnetic field is transverse, so H_x, H_y, but E has a longitudinal component E_z and transverse components E_x, E_y. The boundary condition is that the tangential E is zero, which would mean E_x = 0 and E_y = 0 at the boundary. How does this relate to H?\n\nUsing the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = jωε E. At the boundary x=0, E_x = 0 and E_y = 0, so ∇ × H = jωε E_z * (direction?). Let's compute ∇ × H for TM modes. Since H has no z-component, the curl of H is:\n\n(∂H_z/∂y - ∂H_y/∂z, ∂H_x/∂z - ∂H_z/∂x, ∂H_y/∂x - ∂H_x/∂y) = jωε (E_x, E_y, E_z)\n\nBut for TM modes, H_z = 0, so the first two components are -∂H_y/∂z and ∂H_x/∂z, respectively. At the boundary x=0, E_x = 0 and E_y = 0, so:\n\n-∂H_y/∂z = 0\n\n∂H_x/∂z = 0\n\nAnd the z-component is ∂H_y/∂x - ∂H_x/∂y = jωε E_z.\n\nBut at x=0, what can we say about ∂H_y/∂z and ∂H_x/∂z? If the wave is propagating in the z-direction, then the fields have a dependence on z of the form e^{jk_z z}, so ∂/∂z = jk_z. Therefore, -∂H_y/∂z = -jk_z H_y = 0 ⇒ H_y = 0 at x=0. Similarly, ∂H_x/∂z = jk_z H_x = 0 ⇒ H_x = 0 at x=0. Therefore, at the boundary x=0, the tangential components of H (H_x and H_y) are zero.\n\nWait, this is interesting! For TM modes, at the boundary x=0, the tangential components of H (H_x and H_y) are zero. For TE modes, the derivative of H_z with respect to the normal is zero. So, depending on the mode, the boundary conditions for H are different.\n\nBut the question is about general boundary conditions for H at the waveguide walls, not specific to TE or TM modes. However, these examples show that the boundary conditions for H depend on the type of mode. But perhaps there is a general condition that applies to all components of H.\n\nLet me try to generalize. For any mode, the boundary conditions on E (tangential E = 0) will translate via Maxwell's equations to conditions on H. For example, in TE modes, it leads to a Neumann condition on H_z, and in TM modes, it leads to Dirichlet conditions on H_x and H_y. \n\nBut to find a general condition, let's consider that at the boundary, the tangential E is zero. Using the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = jωε E (assuming time-harmonic fields), at the boundary, this equation must hold. If we take the tangential components of this equation, since E_tangential is zero, the tangential components of ∇ × H must also be zero. \n\nLet me explain. The equation ∇ × H = jωε E. At the boundary, E_tangential = 0, so the tangential components of ∇ × H must be zero. Let's look at the tangential components of ∇ × H.\n\nFor example, at the boundary x=0, the tangential directions are y and z. The tangential components of ∇ × H are the y and z components of the curl.\n\nThe y-component of ∇ × H is ∂H_z/∂x - ∂H_x/∂z.\n\nThe z-component is ∂H_x/∂y - ∂H_y/∂x.\n\nThese must equal the tangential components of jωε E, which are zero. Therefore:\n\nAt x=0:\n\n∂H_z/∂x - ∂H_x/∂z = 0\n\n∂H_x/∂y - ∂H_y/∂x = 0\n\nSimilarly, for other boundaries.\n\nAssuming the wave is propagating in the z-direction, the fields have a dependence on z of e^{jk_z z}, so derivatives with respect to z can be replaced by jk_z. Let's do that.\n\nFor the first equation: ∂H_z/∂x - jk_z H_x = 0 ⇒ ∂H_z/∂x = jk_z H_x\n\nFor the second equation: ∂H_x/∂y - ∂H_y/∂x = 0\n\nBut this is getting into the specific relations between the field components. However, these are general conditions derived from the boundary conditions on E and Maxwell's equations.\n\nBut how can we translate this into boundary conditions for H? For example, at x=0, the first equation gives ∂H_z/∂x = jk_z H_x. At the boundary x=0, this relates H_x and the derivative of H_z. Similarly, the second equation relates derivatives of H_x and H_y.\n\nHowever, without additional information, it's hard to simplify further. But if we consider that in TE modes, H_x and H_y are derived from H_z, and in TM modes, H_x and H_y are related to E_z, which has boundary conditions, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the fields are propagating in the z-direction, then for a waveguide mode, the fields vary as e^{jk_z z}, and we can replace ∂/∂z with jk_z. Let's apply this to the first equation:\n\n∂H_z/∂x = jk_z H_x ⇒ H_x = (1/jk_z) ∂H_z/∂x\n\nAt x=0, this gives H_x = (1/jk_z) ∂H_z/∂x |_{x=0}\n\nBut from the TE mode boundary condition, we had that ∂H_z/∂x |_{x=0} = 0, which would imply H_x = 0 at x=0. But in TE modes, H_x is not necessarily zero at the boundary. Wait, in TE modes, H_z has its derivative zero at the boundary, but H_x and H_y can have non-zero values. For example, in a TE mode, H_z is maximum at the boundary, and its derivative is zero, but H_x and H_y are related to the derivatives of H_z in other directions.\n\nThis suggests that the general boundary conditions for H are not simply that H is zero or its derivative is zero, but rather relations between the components of H and its derivatives. These relations depend on the mode and the specific components.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer expected here is that the tangential component of H is continuous, and since there is no surface current, it is equal to the tangential component inside. But since inside the conductor we don't know, this is not helpful. However, in many textbooks, it is stated that for a perfect conductor, the boundary conditions for the magnetic field are that the tangential component of H is equal to the surface current density, which is zero in this case, so the tangential component of H is continuous. But without knowing the inside, this doesn't give a specific condition on H in the waveguide.\n\nBut in practice, when solving waveguide problems, for TE modes, we use the condition that the derivative of H_z with respect to the normal is zero, and for TM modes, the tangential components of H are zero at the boundary. These are derived from the boundary conditions on E and the specific mode type.\n\nGiven that the question is about the boundary conditions for H at the waveguide walls, and not specific to TE or TM modes, but in general, I think the answer is that the tangential component of H is continuous across the boundary, and since there is no surface current, it is equal to the tangential component inside. However, since inside the conductor we don't have information, this is not a direct condition on H in the waveguide. But in the context of waveguide problems, where we are solving for the fields inside the waveguide, the boundary conditions are derived from the requirement that the tangential E is zero, which via Maxwell's equations leads to specific conditions on H, such as the derivative conditions for TE modes or zero tangential H for TM modes.\n\nHowever, since the question is general, not specific to TE or TM, the most accurate answer based on standard boundary conditions is that the tangential component of H is continuous at the boundary, and since there is no surface current, it is equal to the tangential component inside. But since we don't know the inside, this is not a condition on H in the waveguide. However, in practice, for waveguide problems, the boundary conditions for H are derived from the zero tangential E condition, leading to specific differential conditions on H, like the derivative of H_z being zero at the walls for TE modes.\n\nGiven that, and considering common textbook treatments, the boundary conditions for H at the walls of a waveguide (perfect conductor) are that the tangential component of H is continuous, and for the specific case of rectangular waveguides, this leads to conditions like the derivative of the longitudinal component of H being zero at the walls. But since the question is general, I think the expected answer is that the tangential component of H is continuous, and since there is no surface current, it is zero? No, that would be if the tangential H inside is zero, but we don't know that.\n\nWait, another thought: in the case of a perfect conductor, since the electric field inside is zero, and using the Maxwell equation ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t, inside the conductor, J = σ E = 0 (since E=0), and D=ε E=0, so ∇ × H = 0 inside the conductor. If we assume that the fields decay rapidly inside the conductor (skin effect), then H inside the conductor approaches zero as we go deeper into the conductor. Therefore, at the boundary (x=0), the tangential component of H outside equals the tangential component inside, which is approaching zero. Hence, the tangential component of H outside must be zero. Similarly, the normal component of H outside equals the normal component inside, which, if H inside approaches zero, would also be zero. Therefore, at the boundary, both the tangential and normal components of H are zero?\n\nBut this would mean H=0 at the boundary, which contradicts what we know about waveguide modes, where H is not zero at the walls. For example, in TE modes, H_z is maximum at the walls, and its derivative is zero. So, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.\n\nWhere is the mistake here? If ∇ × H = 0 inside the conductor and H approaches zero deep inside, then the solution for H inside the conductor would be zero. But at the boundary, the tangential component of H outside equals the tangential component inside, which is zero. Therefore, tangential H outside is zero. Similarly, normal component is zero. Hence, H=0 at the boundary. But this contradicts the TE mode where H_z is non-zero at the boundary. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! The mistake is in assuming that the fields inside the conductor are zero. In reality, the fields inside the conductor are not zero, but they decay rapidly due to the skin effect. However, at the surface (x=0), the tangential component of H outside is equal to the tangential component inside. If the fields inside the conductor are decaying exponentially, then at x=0, the tangential H inside is equal to the tangential H outside. It is not necessarily zero. Therefore, the tangential H outside is equal to the tangential H inside, which is not zero. Hence, there is no condition that the tangential H is zero at the boundary, only that it is continuous.\n\nTherefore, the general boundary condition for H at a perfect conductor is that the tangential component of H is continuous, and since there is no surface current, it is equal to the tangential component inside. However, since we don't know the fields inside, this doesn't give us a direct condition on H in the waveguide. But when solving the waveguide problem, we use the boundary conditions on E to derive conditions on H, which for TE and TM modes give specific conditions like the derivative of H_z being zero at the walls.\n\nGiven that the question is asking for the boundary conditions that H satisfies at the waveguide walls, and considering standard references, the answer is likely that the tangential component of H is continuous across the boundary, and since there is no surface current, it is equal to the tangential component inside. But since we are to provide conditions that H satisfies in the waveguide, it must be derived from the boundary conditions on E. \n\nHowever, without going into specific modes, the general boundary condition is that the tangential component of H is continuous, and the normal component of B is continuous. Since B = μ H, and assuming μ is the same on both sides, the normal component of H is also continuous. Therefore, at the boundary, both the tangential and normal components of H are continuous. But since inside the conductor we don't have information, this is not a condition on H in the waveguide, except that it must match the inside, which is not part of the problem.\n\nGiven the confusion and the need to provide an answer, I think the expected answer is that the tangential component of H is continuous at the boundary, and since there is no surface current, it is zero? No, that would be incorrect. Alternatively, for a perfect conductor, the boundary condition is that the tangential component of H is equal to the surface current density, which is zero, so the tangential component of H is continuous and equal to zero? No, that would only be true if the tangential component inside is zero, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, let me check a textbook. In Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, the boundary conditions for H at a surface current K are that the tangential component of H has a discontinuity equal to K. For a perfect conductor, if there are no free surface currents, then the tangential component of H is continuous. But since inside the conductor, we don't know H, this doesn't give a specific value, but in the context of waveguides, the fields must satisfy additional conditions from the zero tangential E, which translate to conditions on H.\n\nGiven that, and considering common waveguide problems, the boundary conditions for H at the walls x=0, x=a, y=0, y=b are that the tangential components of H are continuous, and for the specific case of rectangular waveguides, this leads to conditions like the derivative of the longitudinal component of H being zero at the walls (for TE modes). But since the question is general, the answer is likely that the tangential component of H is continuous, and since there is no surface current, it is equal to the tangential component inside the conductor. However, since we are to state the boundary conditions that H satisfies at the walls, and not relate it to the inside, the answer is that the tangential component of H is continuous, and the normal component of B is continuous. Since B = μ H, if μ is the same, then the normal component of H is also continuous.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the boundary conditions that H satisfies. So, the two boundary conditions are:\n\n1. The tangential component of H is continuous across the boundary. Since there is no surface current, this means the discontinuity is zero.\n\n2. The normal component of B is continuous, which for μ = μ₀ (same on both sides) means the normal component of H is continuous.\n\nTherefore, at the waveguide walls, both the tangential and normal components of H are continuous. But since the walls are perfect conductors, and the fields inside the conductor are not part of the waveguide problem, these conditions are applied to the H field in the waveguide, implying that at the boundary, the tangential and normal components of H do not have discontinuities.\n\nHowever, in practice, for waveguide problems, these conditions are used in conjunction with the boundary conditions on E to derive specific differential equations for the fields. For example, for TE modes, the condition on E_tangential leads to the derivative of H_z being zero at the walls, which is a Neumann boundary condition.\n\nGiven that, the answer to the question is likely that the magnetic field H satisfies the condition that its tangential components are continuous at the waveguide walls, and since there are no surface currents, these tangential components are equal to the tangential components inside the conductor. However, since the interior of the conductor is not part of the waveguide problem, the practical boundary condition for H in the waveguide is derived from the requirement that the tangential E is zero, leading to specific conditions on the derivatives of H components at the walls.\n\nBut since the question is asking for the boundary conditions that H satisfies, and not the derivation, the most precise answer based on standard electromagnetic boundary conditions is:\n\nAt the perfectly conducting walls of the waveguide, the tangential component of the magnetic field H is continuous, and since there are no surface currents, it is equal to the tangential component inside the conductor. However, because the interior of the conductor is not part of the waveguide's field region, the practical implication is that the tangential components of H must satisfy conditions derived from the zero tangential E boundary condition, which for TE and TM modes result in specific differential conditions on H.\n\nBut since the question likely expects a more direct answer, I'll recall that in many textbooks, for a perfect conductor, the boundary conditions for the magnetic field are that the tangential component of H is equal to the surface current density, which is zero here, so the tangential component of H is continuous and equals zero? No, that would be incorrect unless there is a reason for the tangential H to be zero, which there isn't in general.\n\nWait, another angle: the boundary condition for the magnetic field at a perfect conductor is that the normal component of B is continuous and the tangential component of H is continuous. Since B = μ H, if the waveguide is filled with a non-magnetic material (μ = μ₀) and the walls are also non-magnetic (μ = μ₀), then the normal component of H is continuous. But this doesn't give a condition on H itself, only that it is continuous across the boundary.\n\nTherefore, the boundary conditions for H at the waveguide walls are:\n\n1. The tangential component of H is continuous (no surface current).\n\n2. The normal component of H is continuous (assuming μ is continuous).\n\nBut since these are continuity conditions across the boundary, and the fields inside the conductor are not part of the waveguide problem, these conditions are applied to the H field in the waveguide, implying that at the boundary, the tangential and normal components of H do not have discontinuities.\n\nHowever, since the question is about the conditions that H satisfies at the walls, and not about continuity across the boundary, it might be that the answer is that the tangential component of H is continuous, and since there is no surface current, it is zero? No, that would be incorrect. The correct boundary condition is that the tangential component of H is continuous, but its value is not necessarily zero. The value is determined by the fields in the waveguide, which must also satisfy the condition that the tangential E is zero, which in turn imposes specific conditions on H.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll conclude that the boundary conditions for H at the waveguide walls are that the tangential component of H is continuous, and since there is no surface current, it is equal to the tangential component inside the conductor. However, in the context of solving for the fields in the waveguide, this leads to specific conditions derived from the zero tangential E condition, such as the derivative of the longitudinal component of H being zero at the walls for TE modes. Therefore, the general boundary conditions are the continuity of tangential H and normal B, but in practice, for waveguide problems, this translates to specific differential conditions on H.\n\nBut to directly answer the question, the boundary conditions that H satisfies at the waveguide walls are that the tangential component of H is continuous, and since there are no surface currents, the discontinuity is zero. Additionally, the normal component of B is continuous, which for non-magnetic materials means the normal component of H is also continuous. Therefore, at the walls x=0, a and y=0, b, both the tangential and normal components of H are continuous. However, since the interior of the conductor is not part of the waveguide, these conditions are applied to the H field in the waveguide, implying that at the boundary, the tangential and normal components of H do not have discontinuities.\n\nBut to express this in terms of the fields in the waveguide, it means that at the walls, the tangential component of H is such that it satisfies the continuity condition, and the normal component of H is also continuous. However, without additional information from the electric field boundary conditions, this is as far as we can go.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the magnetic field H satisfies the boundary conditions of continuity for its tangential and normal components at the waveguide walls, specifically:\n\n- The tangential component of H is continuous, implying no surface current (H_tangential = 0 if inside the conductor H is zero, but generally it's continuous).\n\n- The normal component of H is continuous, assuming the permeability is the same on both sides of the boundary.\n\nBut since the question is likely expecting a more specific answer related to the waveguide's field behavior, and given that in standard waveguide theory, for TE modes the derivative of H_z is zero at the walls, and for TM modes the tangential H is zero, but since it's asking generally, the answer is the continuity of tangential H and normal B.\n\nHowever, since the user might expect the standard boundary conditions for waveguides, which are derived from the perfect conductor's zero tangential E, leading to conditions on H, I'll go with the following:\n\nAt the perfectly conducting walls of the waveguide, the magnetic field H satisfies the condition that its tangential components are continuous, and since there are no surface currents, these tangential components are equal to the tangential components inside the conductor. However, because the electric field is zero tangentially at the walls, this imposes additional constraints on H through Maxwell's equations, leading to specific conditions like the derivative of the longitudinal component of H being zero at the walls for TE modes.\n\nBut since the question asks for the boundary conditions that H satisfies, and not the derivation, the most precise and general answer is that the tangential component of H is continuous across the boundary, and the normal component of B is continuous. Since B = μ H, and assuming μ is the same on both sides, the normal component of H is also continuous. Therefore, at the waveguide walls x=0, a and y=0, b, both the tangential and normal components of H are continuous.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{H}$ satisfies the boundary conditions that its tangential components are continuous and its normal component is continuous at the waveguide walls. Specifically, at $x=0, a$ and $y=0, b$, the tangential components of $\\boldsymbol{H}$ are continuous and the normal component of $\\boldsymbol{H}$ is continuous. These conditions are expressed as:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0,a} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left. \\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0,b} = 0\n$$\nfor TE modes, leading to the boxed result for the general boundary conditions on $\\boldsymbol{H}$ at the walls.\n\nHowever, based on the general boundary conditions for a perfect conductor, the correct and concise answer is that the tangential component of $\\boldsymbol{H}$ is continuous and there is no surface current. This leads to the conclusion that the boundary conditions for $\\boldsymbol{H}$ are such that the tangential components are zero if derived from the electric field boundary conditions. But considering the standard result for waveguides, the final answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{The tangential component of } \\boldsymbol{H} \\text{ is continuous and the normal component of } \\boldsymbol{B} \\text{ is continuous at the walls.}}\n$$\n\nBut since the question asks for the boundary conditions that $\\boldsymbol{H}$ satisfies, and considering the specific result for waveguides, the most appropriate answer is that the tangential component of $\\boldsymbol{H}$ must be zero at the walls. However, this is only true for certain modes. Given the confusion and the need for a precise answer, I'll refer to standard boundary conditions for perfect conductors, which state that the tangential component of $\\boldsymbol{H}$ is equal to the surface current density. Since there are no surface currents, the tangential component of $\\boldsymbol{H}$ is continuous, but not necessarily zero. Therefore, the correct boundary conditions are the continuity of tangential $\\boldsymbol{H}$ and normal $\\boldsymbol{B}$. \n\nAfter careful consideration, the correct and final answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{The tangential component of } \\boldsymbol{H} \\text{ is continuous and the normal component of } \\boldsymbol{B} \\text{ is continuous at the waveguide walls.}}\n$$\n</think>"}
