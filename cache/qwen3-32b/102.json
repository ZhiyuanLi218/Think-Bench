Hmm, divisors... right, those are numbers that can divide 196 without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that to find the number of divisors of a number, it's helpful to start with its prime factorization. Prime factorization breaks down a number into the product of prime numbers raised to their respective powers. Once I have that, there's a formula involving adding one to each exponent and multiplying them together. Let me recall that formula... I think it's something like if the prime factorization is $ p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c $... then the number of divisors is $ (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... $. Yeah, that sounds right. So I need to find the prime factors of 196 and their exponents first.\n\nAlright, let's start factoring 196. I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 196 by 2: 196 ÷ 2 = 98. Okay, so 2 is a prime factor. Now let's factor 98. Again, it's even, so divide by 2 again: 98 ÷ 2 = 49. So now we have 2 × 2 so far. Now, 49 is not even, so let's check the next prime number, which is 3. 49 divided by 3 is not a whole number because 3 × 16 = 48, and 49 - 48 = 1. So 3 doesn't work. Next prime is 5, but 49 ends with a 9, so it's not divisible by 5. Next prime is 7. Let's try that: 49 ÷ 7 = 7. Perfect, so 7 is a prime factor, and it divides into 49 exactly 7 times. So putting it all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2 × 2 × 7 × 7. \n\nSo in exponent form, that would be $ 2^2 \\times 7^2 $. Let me check that: 2 squared is 4, 7 squared is 49, and 4 × 49 is indeed 196. Yep, that's correct. \n\nNow, applying the formula for the number of divisors. For each exponent in the prime factorization, we add 1 to it and then multiply those together. Here, the exponents are both 2 for the primes 2 and 7. So adding 1 to each exponent gives us 2 + 1 = 3 and 2 + 1 = 3. Then multiplying those together: 3 × 3 = 9. Therefore, 196 should have 9 positive divisors. \n\nWait, let me verify that by listing them out to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes formulas can be tricky if you misapply them. Let's list all the divisors. \n\nStarting with 1, since 1 divides every number. Then 2, since it's even. 4 is also a divisor because 196 ÷ 4 = 49. Then 7, since 7 × 28 = 196. Let me check 14: 14 × 14 = 196. Oh, that's interesting. Then 28: 28 × 7 = 196. 49: 49 × 4 = 196. 98: 98 × 2 = 196. And finally 196 itself. Let me count them:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. Okay, that matches the formula result. So that seems correct. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if I missed any numbers between 1 and 196 that might divide it. For example, let's check 3. 1 + 9 + 6 = 16, and 16 isn't divisible by 3, so 3 doesn't divide 196. How about 5? 196 ends with a 6, so no. 6? Since 196 isn't divisible by 3, it's not divisible by 6 either. 8? Let's see: 196 ÷ 8 = 24.5, which isn't a whole number. 10? No, same reason as 5. 12? No, same as 6. 16? 16 × 12 = 192, 196 - 192 = 4, so no. 18? 18 × 10 = 180, 18 × 11 = 198, which is over. So no. 20? No. 21? 21 × 9 = 189, 21 × 10 = 210. Nope. So seems like I didn't miss any. \n\nAnother way to check is to use the formula again. Since prime factors are 2² and 7², exponents 2 and 2. (2+1)(2+1) = 9. Yep. So that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, another method is to consider all combinations of the exponents in the prime factors. Since 2² and 7², any divisor of 196 must be of the form 2^a * 7^b, where a can be 0, 1, or 2 and b can be 0, 1, or 2. So the number of possible combinations is 3 choices for a and 3 choices for b, totaling 3*3=9. Let's list them:\n\n- a=0, b=0: 2^0 * 7^0 = 1\n- a=1, b=0: 2^1 * 7^0 = 2\n- a=2, b=0: 2^2 * 7^0 = 4\n- a=0, b=1: 2^0 * 7^1 = 7\n- a=1, b=1: 2^1 * 7^1 = 14\n- a=2, b=1: 2^2 * 7^1 = 28\n- a=0, b=2: 2^0 * 7^2 = 49\n- a=1, b=2: 2^1 * 7^2 = 98\n- a=2, b=2: 2^2 * 7^2 = 196\n\nYep, that's 9 divisors. So that's another confirmation. \n\nTherefore, I'm pretty confident that the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9. \n\nBut just to recap the steps clearly for someone else who might be learning this:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 196. Start dividing by the smallest primes:\n   - 196 ÷ 2 = 98\n   - 98 ÷ 2 = 49\n   - 49 ÷ 7 = 7\n   - 7 ÷ 7 = 1\n   So prime factors are 2² * 7².\n\n2. Use the formula for the number of divisors: add 1 to each exponent and multiply.\n   - Exponents are 2 and 2.\n   - (2 + 1) * (2 + 1) = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n3. Verify by listing all divisors or by checking combinations of exponents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The formula works because each divisor is uniquely determined by the exponents of the prime factors, and by taking all possible combinations (from exponent 0 up to the maximum in the factorization), we account for every possible divisor. Since exponents for 2 can be 0,1,2 and for 7 can be 0,1,2, that's 3*3=9 combinations. Makes sense. \n\nAnother check: if I remember correctly, perfect squares have an odd number of divisors because one of them is a square root that isn't paired with a distinct divisor. 196 is 14 squared, so it should have an odd number of divisors, which 9 is. If it were not a perfect square, the number of divisors would be even. So that's another consistency check. \n\nSo yeah, all signs point to 9. I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>"}
