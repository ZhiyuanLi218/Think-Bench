Then, find N mod 1000. Hmm. Let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. N is 22% less than one integer. So, if I have an integer, say, x, then N is 22% less than x. That would mean N = x - 0.22x = 0.78x. Similarly, N is 16% greater than another integer, say y. So N = y + 0.16y = 1.16y. So N has to satisfy both equations:\n\nN = 0.78x\n\nand\n\nN = 1.16y\n\nfor some integers x and y. And N has to be the least positive integer for which this is true. Then, find N mod 1000.\n\nSo, since N must be an integer, 0.78x must be integer, and 1.16y must be integer. Let me write that as fractions to make it clearer.\n\n0.78 is 78/100, which simplifies to 39/50. Similarly, 1.16 is 116/100, which simplifies to 29/25. So:\n\nN = (39/50)x\n\nand\n\nN = (29/25)y\n\nTherefore, since N must be an integer, x must be a multiple of 50 divided by the gcd of 39 and 50. Let me check. Since 39 and 50 are coprime? Let's see: gcd(39,50). Factors of 39 are 3 and 13; 50 is 2 and 5. So yes, they are coprime. Therefore, x must be a multiple of 50 to make N integer. Similarly, for N = 29/25 y, since 29 and 25 are coprime (29 is prime, 25 is 5²), so y must be a multiple of 25. Therefore, x = 50k and y = 25m for integers k and m. Then N = 39/50 * 50k = 39k, and N = 29/25 * 25m = 29m. Therefore, N must be a multiple of both 39 and 29? Wait, no. Wait, N is equal to 39k and also equal to 29m. Therefore, N must be a common multiple of 39 and 29? Wait, no. Wait, N is equal to 39k and also equal to 29m. Therefore, N must be a common multiple of 39 and 29? Wait, not necessarily. Because k and m can be any integers. So N is a multiple of 39 and also a multiple of 29? No, if N is equal to 39k, then N is a multiple of 39. Similarly, N is equal to 29m, so N is a multiple of 29. Therefore, N must be a common multiple of 39 and 29. Therefore, the least such N is the least common multiple (LCM) of 39 and 29.\n\nBut wait, let me check. Since 39 and 29: 29 is prime, and 39 is 3*13. Since 29 doesn't divide into 3 or 13, LCM(39,29) = 39*29 = 1131. Therefore, N is 1131? But let me check if this works. Let me check if N = 1131 can be written as 0.78x and 1.16y for integers x and y.\n\nSo for N = 1131, x = N / 0.78 = 1131 / 0.78. Let me compute that. 1131 divided by 0.78. Let me convert that to fractions. Since 0.78 is 39/50, so dividing by 39/50 is multiplying by 50/39. Therefore, x = 1131 * (50/39). Let me compute 1131 divided by 39 first. Let me divide 1131 by 39. 39*29 is 1131? Because 39*30 is 1170, so 39*29 is 1170 - 39 = 1131. Yes! So 1131 / 39 = 29. Then x = 29 * 50 = 1450. So x is an integer. Similarly, y = N / 1.16 = 1131 / 1.16. Again, 1.16 is 29/25, so dividing by 29/25 is multiplying by 25/29. Therefore, y = 1131 * (25/29). Again, 1131 divided by 29 is 39, as we saw earlier. Therefore, y = 39*25 = 975. Which is also an integer. So N = 1131 satisfies both conditions, and since LCM(39,29) is 1131, which is the least common multiple, so 1131 is the minimal N? Therefore, the answer is 1131 mod 1000, which is 131.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there isn't a smaller N. Because maybe my reasoning is missing something. Let me check.\n\nThe problem says N is 22% less than one integer and 16% greater than another. So N = 0.78x and N = 1.16y. Therefore, x = N / 0.78 and y = N / 1.16. For x and y to be integers, N must be divisible by 0.78 and 1.16? Wait, no. Wait, N must be such that N / 0.78 is integer, which is equivalent to N / (39/50) = 50N / 39 is integer. Therefore, 50N must be divisible by 39. Similarly, N / 1.16 = N / (29/25) = 25N / 29 must be integer, so 25N must be divisible by 29. Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n50N ≡ 0 mod 39,\n\nand\n\n25N ≡ 0 mod 29.\n\nSo we need to find the smallest positive integer N such that:\n\n50N ≡ 0 mod 39,\n\nand\n\n25N ≡ 0 mod 29.\n\nTherefore, solving these congruences.\n\nLet me first simplify these congruences.\n\nFirst congruence: 50N ≡ 0 mod 39.\n\nNote that 50 mod 39 is 11, so 50 ≡ 11 mod 39. Therefore, 11N ≡ 0 mod 39. Therefore, 11N is divisible by 39. Since gcd(11, 39) = gcd(11, 39) = 1? Wait 11 divides into 39? No, 11*3=33, 11*4=44. So gcd(11,39) is 1? Wait, 39 is 3*13. 11 is prime, and doesn't divide 3 or 13, so yes, gcd(11,39)=1. Therefore, since 11 and 39 are coprime, the congruence 11N ≡ 0 mod 39 implies N ≡ 0 mod 39. Therefore, N must be a multiple of 39.\n\nSimilarly, for the second congruence: 25N ≡ 0 mod 29.\n\n25 and 29 are coprime? Since 29 is prime and 25 < 29 and doesn't divide 29. So yes, gcd(25,29)=1. Therefore, similar to above, since 25 is invertible mod 29, multiplying both sides by inverse of 25 mod 29, we get N ≡ 0 mod 29. Therefore, N must be a multiple of 29.\n\nTherefore, N must be a common multiple of 39 and 29, so the least common multiple of 39 and 29. Which is LCM(39,29). Since they are coprime? Wait, 39 is 3*13, 29 is prime. 29 doesn't divide into 3 or 13, so yes, gcd(39,29)=1. Therefore LCM(39,29)=39*29=1131. Therefore, N=1131 is the minimal such integer. Therefore, N mod 1000 is 1131 - 1000 = 131. Therefore, the answer is 131.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check if there's a smaller N that satisfies both congruences. Suppose N is not necessarily LCM(39,29), but maybe there is some overlap?\n\nBut since N must be multiple of 39 and multiple of 29, and since they are coprime, LCM is the product, so there can't be a smaller N. Therefore, 1131 is indeed the minimal N. Therefore, the answer is 131. Wait, but let me check again with actual numbers. Let me check if N=1131 is indeed 22% less than x=1450 and 16% greater than y=975. Let's check 22% less than 1450. 22% of 1450 is 0.22*1450. Let me compute 0.22*1450. 0.2*1450 = 290, 0.02*1450=29, so total is 290+29=319. Therefore, 1450 - 319 = 1131. Correct. Then N=1131 is 16% greater than y=975. Let me check 16% of 975 is 0.16*975. Let's compute 0.1*975=97.5, 0.06*975=58.5, so total is 97.5 + 58.5 = 156. Therefore, 975 + 156 = 1131. Correct. So yes, that works. Therefore, 1131 is correct. Therefore, 1131 mod 1000 is 131. Therefore, the answer is 131.\n\nBut let me check if there's a smaller N. Suppose there is some N less than 1131 which satisfies both conditions. Since N must be multiple of 39 and 29, and since LCM(39,29)=1131, there can't be a smaller positive integer which is multiple of both. Therefore, 1131 is indeed the minimal. Therefore, answer is 131. Therefore, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check my logic again. The key step was translating N is 22% less than x to N = 0.78x, which is correct? Yes. 22% less means you subtract 22% of the original. Similarly, 16% greater is adding 16% of the original. So that is correct. Then converting those decimals to fractions, 78/100 and 116/100, simplifying to 39/50 and 29/25. Correct. Then saying that N must be integer, so 39/50 x must be integer, so x must be multiple of 50 / gcd(39,50). Since gcd(39,50)=1, so x must be multiple of 50. Therefore, N is multiple of 39. Similarly for the other equation. Then N must be multiple of 39 and 29. Since they are coprime, LCM is 39*29=1131. Therefore, correct. Therefore, answer is 131. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another approach? Let me think. Suppose we write equations:\n\nLet me denote N = (1 - 0.22)x = 0.78x,\n\nand N = (1 + 0.16)y = 1.16y.\n\nTherefore, x = N / 0.78,\n\nand y = N / 1.16.\n\nSince x and y must be integers, N must be divisible by 0.78 and 1.16? Well, not exactly, but N must be such that when divided by those decimals gives integers. Which is equivalent to N being a multiple of the denominators when expressed in fractions.\n\nAlternatively, cross multiplying:\n\nFrom N = 0.78x => 100N = 78x => 50N = 39x. Therefore, 50N must be divisible by 39. Similarly, N = 1.16y => 100N = 116y => 25N = 29y. Therefore, 25N must be divisible by 29. Therefore, same as before. Therefore, 50N divisible by 39 => 50N ≡ 0 mod 39. As 50 ≡ 11 mod 39, so 11N ≡ 0 mod 39. Since gcd(11,39)=1, N ≡ 0 mod 39. Similarly, 25N ≡ 0 mod 29. Since 25 and 29 coprime, N ≡ 0 mod 29. Therefore, N must be multiple of LCM(39,29)=1131. Therefore, same result. Therefore, answer is 131. Therefore, confident that 131 is the answer. Therefore, I think that's the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{131}\n</think>"}
