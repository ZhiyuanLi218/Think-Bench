The problem states that the core module is in uniform circular motion around the Earth, and we know the gravitational constant. Let me recall the physics involved here.\n\nFirst, when an object is in uniform circular motion, the centripetal force required to keep it in orbit is provided by the gravitational force between the Earth and the module. So, the gravitational force equals the centripetal force. The formula for gravitational force is F = G*(M*m)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the Earth's mass, m is the module's mass, and r is the orbital radius. The centripetal force is given by F = m*v²/r or m*r*ω², where v is the linear velocity and ω is the angular velocity.\n\nSetting these equal: G*M*m/r² = m*v²/r or G*M*m/r² = m*r*ω². Then, simplifying, the mass of the module (m) cancels out in both equations. So, for the first case, G*M/r² = v²/r, which simplifies to G*M/r = v², so M = (v² * r)/G. For the second case, G*M/r² = r*ω², so M = (r³ * ω²)/G. \n\nAlternatively, if we use the orbital period T, since angular velocity ω = 2π/T, substituting into the second equation gives M = (r³*(4π²)/T²)/G = (4π²*r³)/(G*T²). So, if we know the orbital period T and the radius r, we can calculate M. Similarly, if we know the linear velocity v and the radius r, we can also calculate M. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: Mass of the module and orbital radius. But from the equations, the module's mass cancels out, so we don't need it. So knowing just the orbital radius isn't enough unless we have another parameter like velocity or period. So A is not sufficient.\n\nOption B: Mass of the module and orbital period. Again, the module's mass isn't needed because it cancels. So having the mass here is unnecessary. If we only have the orbital period, we need the radius to use the formula with T. So B alone isn't sufficient.\n\nOption C: Orbital angular velocity and orbital period. Wait, angular velocity ω is related to the period by ω = 2π/T. If we know both ω and T, they are redundant because knowing one gives the other. So having both doesn't add new information. Therefore, without the radius or velocity, we can't calculate M. So C is not sufficient.\n\nOption D: Orbital linear velocity and orbital radius. From the earlier equation, M = (v² * r)/G. So if we know v and r, we can compute M directly. Therefore, D is a valid option.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me verify each option step by step.\n\nFor option A: If we have the mass of the core module (which isn't needed) and the orbital radius. But without knowing velocity or period, we can't get M. So A is out.\n\nOption B: Mass of the module and orbital period. Again, the mass isn't needed. If we have the period T, but not the radius, we can't compute M. Because the formula with T requires r³. So B is insufficient.\n\nOption C: Angular velocity and period. Since ω = 2π/T, if you have both, they are dependent. So you can't get any new information. Without radius, you can't compute M. For example, M = r³ω²/G. If you don't know r, you can't find M. So C is not enough.\n\nOption D: Linear velocity and orbital radius. As per the equation M = v²r / G. So yes, with v and r, you can compute M. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
