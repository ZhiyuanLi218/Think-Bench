The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The options are A through D with different multiples of ħ. Let me recall how to calculate uncertainty in quantum mechanics. \n\nUncertainty is given by the square root of the variance, which is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². So I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared, then subtract the square of the first from the second and take the square root. \n\nFirst, let me write down the matrix for P_z. According to the problem, P_z is a 3x3 matrix with the first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), and third row (0, 0, -ħ). Wait, actually, looking again, the problem says the matrix form of P_z has components in the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -ħ). So that's the matrix for P_z. \n\nThe state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this vector as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ]^T. \n\nFirst, compute ⟨P_z⟩. To do this, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, maybe this is straightforward? Let me check. \n\nIn general, for a matrix, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum over the diagonal elements weighted by the probabilities? Wait, no, more accurately, since P_z is diagonal in this basis, then the expectation value is just the sum of ψ_i* (P_z)_ii ψ_i. \n\nSo since P_z is diagonal, ⟨P_z⟩ = |ψ₁|² * ħ + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (-ħ). \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst, compute |ψ₁|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |ψ₃|² is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. |ψ₂|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. \n\nSo ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0. \n\nSo ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That simplifies things because the uncertainty will just be sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - 0) = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩). \n\nNow compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Similarly, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will be the square of each diagonal element. So P_z² has entries (ħ², 0, ħ²) on the diagonal? Wait, original P_z has entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So squaring each entry would be (ħ², 0, ħ²). Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ is |ψ₁|² * ħ² + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * ħ². \n\nAgain, |ψ₁|² is 1/4, |ψ₃|² is 1/4. So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ². \n\nTherefore, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2)ħ² - 0 = (1/2)ħ². \n\nThen the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / √2. \n\nLooking at the options, D is ħ/√2. \n\nWait, let me check my steps again to be sure. \n\nFirst, the state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The probabilities for each basis state are the squares of the absolute values. Since all components are real except maybe the signs, but they are squared, so yes. \n\nFor ⟨P_z⟩, since the middle component is multiplied by zero, and the top and bottom components are multiplied by ħ and -ħ respectively. The coefficients squared are both 1/4, so 1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ = 0. That's correct. \n\nFor ⟨P_z²⟩, since we square the operator, the diagonal entries are (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which are all ħ², 0, ħ². Then multiplying by the probabilities: 1/4 * ħ² + 1/4 * ħ² + 1/2 * 0 = 1/2 ħ². \n\nTherefore variance is 1/2 ħ², so uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / √2. Which is option D. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the state vector. The problem says the explicit form of the state is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check if that is indeed an eigenvector of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. \n\nGiven that P_x is the matrix:\n\n[ 0        ħ/√2      0      ]\n\n[ħ/√2     0        ħ/√2   ]\n\n[ 0       ħ/√2     0      ]\n\nLet me verify if multiplying this matrix by the vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) gives -ħ times the vector. \n\nLet me compute P_x * ψ. \n\nFirst component: 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = (ħ/√2)(1/√2) = ħ/2. \n\nBut if the eigenvalue is -ħ, then the first component should be -ħ*(-1/2) = ħ/2. Wait, hold on. Wait, if the eigenvalue is -ħ, then P_x * ψ should equal -ħ * ψ. Let me check each component. \n\nFirst component: P_x * ψ first entry is 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = ħ/2. \n\nOn the other hand, -ħ * ψ first entry is -ħ*(-1/2) = ħ/2. So matches. \n\nSecond component: (ħ/√2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/√2)*(-1/2) = (ħ/√2)(-1/2 -1/2) = (ħ/√2)(-1) = -ħ/√2. \n\nBut -ħ * ψ second component is -ħ*(1/√2) = -ħ/√2. So matches. \n\nThird component: 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = ħ/2. \n\nAnd -ħ * ψ third component is -ħ*(-1/2) = ħ/2. \n\nSo yes, it checks out. Therefore, the state is indeed the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. \n\nTherefore, my calculation for ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ is correct. \n\nTherefore, ΔP_z is ħ/√2, which is option D. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes when you have spin-1 systems, the eigenvalues of S_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. But here P_z seems analogous. The state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So the calculation is straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the given vector is normalized? Let me check the norm. \n\nThe norm squared is (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Yes, it is normalized. So no issues there. \n\nSo all steps are correct. Therefore, the answer should be D: ħ/√2. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
