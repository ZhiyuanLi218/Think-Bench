When titrated with a **strong base like KOH**, the following neutralization reaction occurs:\n\n$$\n\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^- + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\n\nThis is a **1:1 molar ratio** between phenol and hydroxide ion (from KOH). Therefore, for a 25.00 mL sample of approximately 0.10 M phenol, the expected volume of KOH needed should be relatively consistent across the three samples.\n\nHowever, the data shows:\n- Sample 1: 31.75 mL KOH\n- Sample 2: 32.38 mL KOH\n- Sample 3: 41.75 mL KOH\n\nSample 3 required **nearly 30% more** base than the others, indicating a **higher concentration of acidic species** in that sample.\n\n---\n\n### **Analyzing the Options**\n\nLet’s consider each option:\n\n#### **A. The indicator was added too late.**\n\n- Adding the indicator too late during titration might affect the **visibility** of the endpoint, but it **does not alter the actual volume** of titrant needed to neutralize the acid.\n- This is a procedural issue, not a chemical one, and cannot explain a **consistent, significant increase** in titrant volume.\n- **Not a valid explanation.**\n\n#### **B. The wrong indicator was used.**\n\n- The question explicitly states that **cresol red** was used, which is appropriate for a weak acid-strong base titration (pH change from ~7.2 to 8.8).\n- Using a different indicator might shift the **perceived endpoint**, but it would not **increase the actual amount** of base required to neutralize the acid.\n- **Not a valid explanation.**\n\n#### **C. There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.**\n\n- If the beaker had a **base contaminant**, it would **react with the phenol** before the titration began, reducing the amount of phenol available for titration.\n- This would lead to **less KOH** being required to reach the endpoint.\n- However, the sample in question required **more** KOH, so this **contradicts** the observed result.\n- **Not a valid explanation.**\n\n#### **D. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.**\n\n- If the beaker had a **contaminant acid** (e.g., HCl), it would **add extra acidity** to the sample.\n- During titration, the KOH would first neutralize the contaminant acid **before** reacting with the phenol.\n- This would result in **more total base** being required to reach the endpoint, which **matches the observed result** for Sample 3.\n- **This is a valid and consistent explanation** for the increased volume of KOH used.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that logically explains the **increased volume of KOH** used in one of the samples is the **presence of an acidic contaminant** in the beaker. This would increase the total acid content and thus the amount of base required to reach the endpoint.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{D}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out why one of the phenol samples required significantly more KOH to reach the endpoint compared to the other two. The three samples were each 25.00 mL and supposed to be around 0.10 M phenol. The volumes of KOH used were 31.75, 32.38, and 41.75 mL. The third one is way higher. The question is asking which option explains this discrepancy. The options are about indicator timing, wrong indicator, contamination in the beaker with base or acid.\n\nFirst, let me recall what happens in a titration. Phenol is a weak acid, and KOH is a strong base. The reaction would be C6H5OH + OH⁻ → C6H5O⁻ + H2O. So, each mole of phenol should require one mole of KOH. The amount of KOH needed depends on the moles of phenol present. Since all three samples were supposed to be the same concentration and volume, they should require similar volumes of KOH. But one sample needed almost double the volume. That suggests there was something different in that sample.\n\nSo, if the third sample required more base, maybe there was more acidic substance in it. Wait, but if the beaker was contaminated with an acid, that would mean there's more acid to neutralize, so more KOH would be needed. But wait, the problem says the samples were removed from a container and placed into beakers. So maybe the beakers had something in them before? If the beaker wasn't clean and had a base residue, that would mean the base was already present. Wait, but if the beaker was contaminated with a base, then maybe less KOH would be needed because some of the base was already there. But the sample required more base. Hmm. Alternatively, if the beaker was contaminated with an acid, then there's more acid to neutralize, so more KOH needed. Wait, but the sample was phenol, which is an acid. If the beaker had another acid, then the total amount of acid would be higher, so you'd need more base. So maybe option C says there was a base contaminant, and D says acid. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker. If the beaker had a base, then when you add the phenol, the base would neutralize some of the phenol before the titration even starts. Wait, no. If the beaker had a base, then when you add the phenol, the base would react with the phenol. But the phenol is the analyte. Wait, but if the beaker had a base, then the phenol would start reacting with it immediately. So when you titrate with KOH, you would need less base because some of the phenol was already neutralized by the contaminating base. So that would lead to a lower volume of KOH needed. But the sample that required more KOH had a higher volume. So maybe that's not it. Option D is acid contaminating the beaker. If the beaker had an acid, then when you add the phenol sample, the total amount of acid is higher. Therefore, you would need more KOH to neutralize both the original phenol and the contaminating acid. That would explain why more base was needed. So D would be the answer. But wait, the problem says the samples were placed into the beakers. If the beaker had an acid, then the phenol would be mixed with that acid. But phenol is a weak acid. If the beaker had a strong acid, like HCl, then the total moles of H+ would be higher. But in the titration, you're titrating the phenol. Wait, but the titration is with KOH, which neutralizes the phenol. If there's another acid in the beaker, then that would also react with the KOH. So yes, if there was an acidic contaminant in the beaker, then the total amount of base needed would be higher. Therefore, the sample with the higher volume of KOH would be due to an acid contaminant. Therefore, option D. But let me check the other options.\n\nOption A: The indicator was added too late. If the indicator was added too late, would that affect the endpoint? If the indicator was added after the titration had started, maybe it's harder to see the color change, but it shouldn't change the actual volume needed. Unless adding it late caused the person to misread the endpoint. But if the indicator was added too late, maybe the color change was missed, leading to an incorrect volume. But the problem says the samples required different volumes. If it was a human error in reading the indicator, maybe one titration was done incorrectly. But the question is about why the sample required more base, not about titration technique. The options are about possible explanations for the sample itself. So A might not be the right answer.\n\nOption B: The wrong indicator was used. Cresol red has a pH range for its color change. The titration of a weak acid (phenol) with a strong base (KOH) would have an endpoint at a higher pH. The pH at the equivalence point for a weak acid and strong base is basic. Cresol red changes color between pH 7.2 and 8.8, which is suitable for this titration. If the wrong indicator was used, maybe with a different pH range, the endpoint might be detected at a different pH. But the question states that cresol red was used. So if the indicator was correct, then the endpoint should be accurate. If they used the wrong indicator, maybe the endpoint was reached too early or too late. But the problem says they used cresol red, so B is probably not the answer. Unless the indicator was wrong, but the question says they used it. So B is not the answer.\n\nOption C: Base contaminating the beaker. If the beaker had a base, then when you add the phenol, the base would neutralize some of the phenol. Wait, but phenol is a weak acid. If the beaker had a base, then the phenol would react with the base. So the amount of phenol in the solution would be less because some was neutralized by the base already. Therefore, when you titrate with KOH, you would need less KOH because there's less phenol to neutralize. But in the sample that required more KOH, that would not be the case. So if the sample had less phenol, you need less base. So that sample would have a lower volume. But in our case, the sample that required more base had a higher volume. Therefore, option C is not the answer. Option D is acid contaminating the beaker. If the beaker had an acid, then the total acid in the solution is more. Therefore, when titrating, you need more base. That explains the higher volume. So D is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but phenol is already an acid. If the beaker had another acid, like HCl, then the total moles of H+ would be from both the phenol and the HCl. But in the titration, you are titrating the phenol. Wait, no. The reaction is between the phenol and the hydroxide. The phenol is a weak acid, so it will react with the OH⁻. If there's a strong acid like HCl in the beaker, then the OH⁻ from KOH will first neutralize the HCl, then the phenol. So the total amount of KOH needed would be for both the HCl and the phenol. Therefore, more KOH would be needed, which matches the observed result. Therefore, D is the correct answer. So the answer is C or D? Wait, no, D says acid contaminating. So if the beaker had acid, then yes. So the answer is D.\n\nLet me just make sure. If the beaker had a base (option C), then the base would neutralize some of the phenol before titration. So when you titrate, you need less KOH. But the sample that required more KOH is the one in question. So if the beaker had an acid (D), then you need more KOH. Therefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
