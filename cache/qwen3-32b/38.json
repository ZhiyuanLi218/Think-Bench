The jar has 10 red candies and 10 blue candies. Terry picks two at random, then Mary picks two of the remaining. We need to find the probability that they get the same color combination, regardless of order. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. There are 20 candies total: 10 red and 10 blue. Terry picks two, then Mary picks two from what's left. We want the probability that Terry and Mary have the same color combination. The color combination can be either two reds, two blues, or one red and one blue. Since the problem says \"irrespective of order,\" I guess that means if Terry has one red and one blue, Mary also needs to have one red and one blue. Similarly for two reds or two blues.\n\nSo, the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of both Terry and Mary having two reds, plus both having two blues, plus both having one red and one blue. So, maybe I can calculate each case separately and add them up?\n\nLet me think. First, let's figure out the total number of ways Terry can pick two candies. That's C(20, 2), which is 190. Then, after Terry picks two candies, there are 18 left, so Mary picks two from those, which is C(18, 2) = 153. So, the total number of possible outcomes for Terry and Mary is 190 * 153. But since we need probabilities, maybe I don't need to calculate the total number of outcomes but think in terms of conditional probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the probability that Terry gets a certain combination, then multiply by the probability that Mary gets the same combination given Terry's pick. Then sum over all possible combinations.\n\nYes, that sounds like a plan. So, let's break it down:\n\nCase 1: Both Terry and Mary have two red candies.\n\nCase 2: Both have two blue candies.\n\nCase 3: Both have one red and one blue candy.\n\nThen, total probability is P(Case1) + P(Case2) + P(Case3).\n\nSo, let me compute each case.\n\nStarting with Case 1: Terry picks two reds, then Mary also picks two reds.\n\nFirst, probability that Terry picks two reds: C(10, 2)/C(20, 2). C(10, 2) is 45, so that probability is 45/190.\n\nThen, given that Terry took two red candies, there are now 8 red and 10 blue candies left. So total of 18 candies. The probability that Mary picks two reds is C(8, 2)/C(18, 2). C(8, 2) is 28, and C(18, 2) is 153, so 28/153.\n\nTherefore, the probability for Case 1 is (45/190) * (28/153). Let me compute that later. Let me do the same for Case 2.\n\nCase 2: Both Terry and Mary have two blue candies.\n\nSimilarly, probability Terry picks two blues is also C(10, 2)/C(20, 2) = 45/190. Then, given Terry took two blues, there are 10 red and 8 blue left. So Mary's probability of picking two blues is C(8, 2)/C(18, 2) = 28/153. Therefore, same as Case 1: (45/190)*(28/153). So total for Case 1 and 2 combined is 2*(45/190)*(28/153).\n\nNow, Case 3: Both Terry and Mary have one red and one blue.\n\nFirst, probability that Terry picks one red and one blue. How do we compute that? Well, the number of ways is C(10, 1)*C(10, 1) = 10*10 = 100. Therefore, probability is 100/190.\n\nNow, given that Terry picked one red and one blue, how many candies are left? Originally 10 red and 10 blue. Terry took 1 red and 1 blue, so remaining is 9 red and 9 blue. So total 18 candies, same as before. Now, Mary needs to pick one red and one blue. The number of ways Mary can do that is C(9, 1)*C(9, 1) = 81. Total number of ways Mary can pick two candies is C(18, 2) = 153. Therefore, the probability is 81/153.\n\nTherefore, the probability for Case 3 is (100/190) * (81/153).\n\nTherefore, total probability is 2*(45/190)*(28/153) + (100/190)*(81/153).\n\nNow, let me compute this.\n\nFirst, let me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: 2*(45/190)*(28/153). Let me compute 45*28 first. 45*28 is 1260. Multiply by 2: 2520. Then divide by (190*153). Let me compute denominator: 190*153. Let me compute that. Well, 200*153 = 30,600. Subtract 10*153 = 1,530. So 30,600 - 1,530 = 29,070. Therefore, denominator is 29,070. So first term is 2520 / 29,070.\n\nSecond term: (100/190)*(81/153). Let me compute numerator: 100*81 = 8,100. Denominator same as before: 190*153 = 29,070. Therefore, total probability is (2520 + 8100)/29,070 = 10,620 / 29,070.\n\nSimplify this fraction. Let me see.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 10: 1062 / 2907.\n\nNow, let's find GCD of 1062 and 2907. Let me use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCD(2907, 1062). 2907 divided by 1062 is 2 with remainder 2907 - 2*1062 = 2907 - 2124 = 783.\n\nNow GCD(1062, 783). 1062 divided by 783 is 1 with remainder 279.\n\nGCD(783, 279). 783 divided by 279 is 2 with remainder 783 - 2*279 = 783 - 558 = 225.\n\nGCD(279, 225). 279 divided by 225 is 1 with remainder 54.\n\nGCD(225, 54). 225 divided by 54 is 4 with remainder 9.\n\nGCD(54, 9). 54 divided by 9 is 6 with remainder 0. So GCD is 9.\n\nTherefore, divide numerator and denominator by 9: 1062 / 9 = 118, 2907 / 9 = 323.\n\nWait, 1062 ÷ 9: 9*118 is 1062? Let me check 9*100=900, 9*18=162, so 900+162=1062. Yes. And 2907 ÷ 9: 9*300=2700, 2907-2700=207, 207 ÷ 9=23. So 300 + 23 = 323. Therefore, simplified fraction is 118/323.\n\nWait, so total probability is 118/323? Let me check my calculations again because I might have made an error.\n\nWait, original total was 10,620 / 29,070. Divided by 10: 1,062 / 2,907. Then GCD(1,062, 2,907). Wait, earlier I said 1062 and 2907, but if we divide numerator and denominator by 10, it's 1062/2907. So yes, GCD(1062, 2907) is 9, so 1062/9=118, 2907/9=323. So yes, 118/323. Now, check if 118 and 323 have common factors. Let's check.\n\nFactors of 118: 2 * 59. 59 is a prime number. Check if 59 divides 323: 59*5=295, 59*5 + 28= 323. So no. 323 ÷ 59 is approx 5.47. So 323 factors: Let's check 17*19=323? 17*18=306, 17*19=323. Yes! 17*19=323. And 118 is 2*59. So no common factors. Therefore, 118/323 is reduced. Therefore, m is 118, n is 323. Then m + n is 118 + 323 = 441.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again because I remember that sometimes with probability problems, there might be another approach or maybe I made an error in calculation.\n\nAlternatively, let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, total probability is:\n\nCase 1: Terry two red, Mary two red: [C(10,2)/C(20,2)] * [C(8,2)/C(18,2)]\n\nSimilarly for blue. So 2*[C(10,2)/C(20,2)]*[C(8,2)/C(18,2)]\n\nCase 3: Terry one red one blue: [C(10,1)C(10,1)/C(20,2)] * [C(9,1)C(9,1)/C(18,2)]\n\nSo numbers:\n\nC(10,2) is 45, C(8,2) is 28, C(10,1)C(10,1) is 100, C(9,1)C(9,1) is 81. Then denominators C(20,2)=190, C(18,2)=153. So yes, same as before. Then total probability is 2*(45*28)/(190*153) + (100*81)/(190*153). Then numerator is 2*45*28 + 100*81. Let me compute that again:\n\nFirst term: 2*45*28. 45*28: 45*20 + 45*8 = 900 + 360 = 1260. Multiply by 2: 2520.\n\nSecond term: 100*81 = 8100.\n\nTotal numerator: 2520 + 8100 = 10620. Denominator: 190*153 = let's check again:\n\n190*153. Let me compute 190*150 + 190*3 = 28,500 + 570 = 29,070. Yes. So 10620 / 29070 = 118/323 as before. So m + n is 118 + 323 = 441. So is 441 the answer?\n\nWait, but I have a doubt because I remember that sometimes in probability problems with multiple steps, there might be an alternative approach or maybe an error in considering dependencies. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of calculating the probability for each case, maybe think of all possible ways Terry and Mary can have the same color combination.\n\nAlternatively, think of the total number of ways Terry and Mary can pick candies, and then count the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nTotal number of ways Terry picks two and then Mary picks two is C(20,2)*C(18,2), which is 190*153 as before. Now, the number of favorable outcomes is:\n\nNumber of ways both have two reds: C(10,2)*C(8,2).\n\nSimilarly for two blues: C(10,2)*C(8,2).\n\nNumber of ways both have one red and one blue: C(10,1)*C(10,1)*C(9,1)*C(9,1). Wait, but hold on. Wait, when Terry picks one red and one blue, and then Mary also picks one red and one blue. However, the number of ways for Mary depends on Terry's pick.\n\nBut actually, if we think in terms of combinations, the total number of favorable outcomes for Terry and Mary both having two reds is C(10,2)*C(8,2). Similarly for two blues. For the case of both having one red and one blue, how many ways?\n\nFirst Terry picks one red and one blue. The number of ways Terry can do that is C(10,1)*C(10,1) = 100. Then, Mary has to pick one red and one blue from the remaining 9 red and 9 blue. So that's C(9,1)*C(9,1) = 81. Therefore, total ways for this case is 100*81. Therefore, total favorable is 2*C(10,2)*C(8,2) + 100*81. Which is same as before: 2*45*28 + 100*81 = 2520 + 8100 = 10620. Therefore, same numerator. So probability is 10620 / (190*153) = 118/323. So same answer. So maybe 441 is correct?\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Maybe using hypergeometric distribution or something else?\n\nAlternatively, think about symmetry. Suppose we consider all possible ways that Terry and Mary can pick two candies each. What is the probability that their color combinations are the same?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of it as: What is the probability that Terry and Mary have the same combination? Since the problem says \"irrespective of order,\" so the combinations are either RR, RB, or BB. So the probability that Terry and Mary have the same combination is P(Terry=RR and Mary=RR) + P(Terry=BB and Mary=BB) + P(Terry=RB and Mary=RB). Which is exactly what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a clever way to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the probability that Mary's combination is same as Terry's. Since the problem is symmetric, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: The total number of ways Terry and Mary can pick two candies each is C(20,2)*C(18,2). The number of favorable cases is as above. Alternatively, maybe think of selecting four candies, then assigning the first two to Terry and next two to Mary. However, since the order of Terry and Mary is considered in the total number of ways, but if we think of all possible ways to choose four candies and then split into Terry and Mary's picks.\n\nWait, actually, the total number of ways Terry and Mary can pick candies is equal to C(20,4)*C(4,2). Wait, no. If we think of selecting four candies, then choosing two for Terry and two for Mary. So total number of ways is C(20,4)*C(4,2). However, in the original problem, Terry picks two, then Mary picks two, so the total number of ordered selections is C(20,2)*C(18,2). However, note that C(20,2)*C(18,2) = [20!/(2!18!)] * [18!/(2!16!)] = 20!/(2!2!16!). Whereas C(20,4)*C(4,2) is [20!/(4!16!)] * [4!/(2!2!)] = 20!/(2!2!16!). Therefore, same number. Therefore, the total number of ways is same as choosing four candies and then splitting into two groups of two. Therefore, maybe we can compute the probability by considering the four-candy approach.\n\nTherefore, maybe compute the probability that when you have four candies, Terry's two and Mary's two, they have the same color combination. So for example, if the four candies are two red and two blue, then Terry could have RR and Mary BB, or Terry RB and Mary RB, etc. Therefore, maybe this approach can help?\n\nSo, let me try this approach. Let me compute the probability by considering the four-candy combinations.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to choose four candies: C(20,4). For each four-candy combination, compute the number of ways Terry and Mary can split them such that they have the same color combination, then divide by total number of splits, which is C(20,4)*C(4,2)... Wait, no. Wait, if we think of the total number of Terry and Mary selections as C(20,2)*C(18,2), which is equivalent to C(20,4)*C(4,2). Therefore, the probability is [sum over all four-candy combinations of (number of favorable splits for that combination)] divided by [C(20,4)*C(4,2)].\n\nBut maybe this is more complex. Alternatively, since each four-candy combination is equally likely, maybe we can compute the probability as follows:\n\nFor each four-candy combination, compute the probability that Terry and Mary have the same color combination. Then multiply by the probability of that four-candy combination. But perhaps this is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the four-candy combinations:\n\nCase 1: Four candies are all red. Then Terry and Mary must both have two reds. How many ways? The number of ways Terry can pick two reds from four is C(4,2) = 6, and Mary gets the remaining two. So only one favorable split? Wait, no. For four red candies, Terry picks any two, Mary gets the other two. Since all splits result in both having two reds. Therefore, for this case, all splits are favorable. Therefore, the number of favorable splits is C(4,2) = 6. But since we are considering the four-candy combination, the total splits for that combination is C(4,2) = 6. Therefore, probability for this case is 1. Similarly for four blue candies.\n\nCase 2: Three red and one blue. Let's think. For Terry and Mary to have same color combination. What combinations are possible? The possible color combinations for Terry: RR, RB. For Mary: same. To have same combination. If Terry has RR, then Mary has to have one red and one blue? But Mary is picking two candies. If there are three red and one blue in total. If Terry picks two reds, then Mary has one red and one blue left. So Mary's combination is RB. Which is different from Terry's. If Terry picks one red and one blue, then Mary has two reds left. So Mary's combination is RR. Again different. Therefore, there's no way for Terry and Mary to have same combination in this case. Therefore, number of favorable splits is 0.\n\nCase 3: Three blue and one red. Similarly, no favorable splits.\n\nCase 4: Two red and two blue. Now, Terry and Mary can have same combination. Let's see. The possible combinations for Terry: RR, RB, BB. For Mary to have same. Let's compute the number of favorable splits.\n\nTotal splits: C(4,2) = 6. How many of these splits result in Terry and Mary having same color combinations.\n\nSame color combinations can be:\n\n- Both Terry and Mary have RR: For Terry to have RR, he needs to pick both reds. Then Mary gets both blues. So this is one split.\n\n- Both have BB: Similarly, Terry picks both blues, Mary gets both reds. Another split.\n\n- Both have RB: How many splits where Terry has one red and one blue, and Mary also has one red and one blue. How many?\n\nTotal splits: 6. Minus the two splits where Terry has RR or BB. So 6 - 2 = 4. However, not all of these 4 splits result in both Terry and Mary having RB. Wait, when Terry has one red and one blue, Mary also has one red and one blue. How many such splits?\n\nNumber of ways Terry can pick one red and one blue is C(2,1)*C(2,1) = 4. But since we are splitting the four candies (two red, two blue), the number of ways Terry can have one red and one blue is 2*2=4, as there are two reds and two blues. However, each split is uniquely determined by Terry's pick. Therefore, there are 4 splits where Terry has one red and one blue, and Mary also has one red and one blue. Therefore, total favorable splits for same color combinations are 2 (for RR and BB) + 4 (for RB)? Wait no. Wait, if we want Terry and Mary to have same combination, then:\n\nIf Terry has RR, Mary has BB: different combination. Similarly, Terry has BB, Mary has RR: different combination. So those are not favorable. The favorable splits are when both have RR or both have BB or both have RB. But in this case, with two red and two blue, both can't have RR or both have BB because there are only two red and two blue. So only way for both to have same combination is if both have RB. Because if Terry takes RR, Mary can't have RR, since only two reds. Similarly for BB. Therefore, only the splits where Terry and Mary both have one red and one blue. Which is 4 splits as above. Wait, but earlier I thought total splits is 6. So out of 6 splits, 2 result in Terry having RR or BB, and 4 result in Terry having RB. But Mary's combination is determined by Terry's. If Terry has RB, then Mary also has RB because there are two red and two blue, and Terry took one of each, leaving one red and one blue for Mary. Therefore, if Terry has RB, Mary also has RB. Therefore, the number of favorable splits is 4. Therefore, for a four-candy combination with two red and two blue, the number of favorable splits is 4.\n\nTherefore, in this case, probability is 4 / 6 = 2/3.\n\nCase 5: One red and three blue. Similar to case 2, no favorable splits.\n\nCase 6: All four blue. Similar to case 1, all splits favorable.\n\nTherefore, now, let me compute the total probability by considering all four-candy combinations.\n\nFirst, compute the number of four-candy combinations in each case:\n\nCase 1: 4 red: C(10,4). Similarly, 4 blue: C(10,4).\n\nCase 4: 2 red and 2 blue: C(10,2)*C(10,2).\n\nOther cases (with 1, 3 red or blue) contribute 0 to the favorable probability.\n\nTherefore, total favorable is:\n\nFor Case 1 and 6: For each four-red or four-blue combination, the number of favorable Terry-Mary splits is C(4,2) (all splits are favorable). However, in our previous approach, when we think of total number of Terry-Mary selections as C(20,4)*C(4,2), but the probability would be [number of favorable four-candy combinations * favorable splits per combination] divided by [total four-candy combinations * total splits per combination].\n\nWait, let me formalize:\n\nTotal number of Terry-Mary selections is C(20,2)*C(18,2) = C(20,4)*C(4,2). Therefore, the probability is:\n\n[Number of favorable Terry-Mary selections] / [C(20,4)*C(4,2)].\n\nBut Number of favorable Terry-Mary selections can be calculated as:\n\nFor four-candy combinations with 4 red: Each such combination contributes C(4,2) favorable splits (since all splits are good). Similarly for four blue.\n\nFor four-candy combinations with 2 red and 2 blue: Each such combination contributes 4 favorable splits.\n\nOther combinations contribute 0.\n\nTherefore, total favorable Terry-Mary selections is:\n\nC(10,4)*C(4,2) + C(10,4)*C(4,2) + C(10,2)*C(10,2)*4.\n\nTherefore, probability is [2*C(10,4)*C(4,2) + C(10,2)^2 * 4] / [C(20,4)*C(4,2)].\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute numerator:\n\nFirst term: 2*C(10,4)*C(4,2). C(10,4) is 210, C(4,2) is 6. So 2*210*6 = 2*1260 = 2520.\n\nSecond term: C(10,2)^2 *4. C(10,2) is 45. So 45^2 *4 = 2025*4 = 8100.\n\nTotal numerator: 2520 + 8100 = 10620. Same as before.\n\nDenominator: C(20,4)*C(4,2). C(20,4) is 4845, C(4,2) is 6. So denominator is 4845*6. Let me compute 4845*6. 4000*6=24,000, 800*6=4,800, 45*6=270. Total is 24,000 + 4,800 = 28,800 + 270 = 29,070. Same denominator as before. Therefore, same probability 10620 / 29070 = 118/323. Therefore, same result. Therefore, seems like 118/323 is correct. Therefore, m + n = 118 + 323 = 441. Therefore, the answer is 441.\n\nBut wait, let me check with actual numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation steps? Let me check 118/323. Let me check if 118 and 323 have common factors. 118 is 2 × 59. 323 divided by 59? 59 × 5 is 295, 323 - 295 is 28. So no. 323 is 17 × 19. Yes, 17 × 19 = 323. So 118 and 323 are coprime? 2 × 59 vs 17 × 19. Yes, no common factors. Therefore, 118/323 is reduced. Therefore, m + n is 441. So I think that is the answer.\n\nBut wait, I remember that in some similar problems, the answer is different. Wait, let me check with actual numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the probability in another way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, think of the probability that Mary's combination is same as Terry's. Since after Terry picks his two candies, the probability depends on what Terry picked.\n\nSo, overall probability is P(Terry's combination) * P(Mary's combination same | Terry's combination). Which is exactly what I did earlier. So that approach gives 118/323. Alternatively, maybe compute the probability that Terry and Mary have the same combination by considering all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: What is the probability that Terry and Mary have the same color combination? Since the problem is symmetric, maybe compute the probability that Mary's combination is same as Terry's. Since Mary is picking after Terry, but the problem is symmetric in some way?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as: What is the probability that two people picking two candies each (without replacement) end up with same color combination. Maybe there's a formula for that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the probability that Terry and Mary have both RR, both BB, or both RB. Which is same as before.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with actual numbers with smaller cases. Maybe take smaller numbers and see if my approach works.\n\nLet me try with smaller numbers. Suppose there are 2 red and 2 blue candies. Terry picks two, then Mary picks the remaining two. What is the probability they have same color combination?\n\nTotal possibilities: Terry picks two, Mary gets the other two. The combinations:\n\nIf Terry picks RR, Mary gets BB. Different combinations.\n\nIf Terry picks RB, Mary gets RB. Same combination.\n\nIf Terry picks BB, Mary gets RR. Different.\n\nTotal combinations: C(4,2) = 6. Out of which, how many have same combination? Only when Terry picks RB. How many ways Terry can pick RB? 2*2=4. Wait, but there are only two red and two blue. The number of ways to pick one red and one blue is 2*2=4. But total Terry picks is 6. Therefore, probability is 4/6 = 2/3. According to our formula, let's compute:\n\nCase 1: Both RR or both BB. Probability Terry picks RR is C(2,2)/C(4,2) = 1/6. Then Mary has BB. So probability for this case is 1/6 * 1 = 1/6. Similarly for BB: same. Total 2*(1/6) = 1/3.\n\nCase 3: Both RB. Probability Terry picks RB is 4/6. Then Mary has to pick RB. Since after Terry picks one red and one blue, there is 1 red and 1 blue left. So Mary picks two, which is RB. The probability is 1 (since only one red and one blue left). Therefore, probability is 4/6 * 1 = 4/6. Therefore total probability is 1/3 + 4/6 = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Wait, that can't be. Wait, in reality, the probability is 2/3. Where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in reality, when Terry picks two candies, and Mary gets the remaining two. The only way they have same combination is when Terry and Mary both have RB. Which is 4/6. Therefore, probability is 4/6 = 2/3. But according to my previous approach, I said Case 1 (both RR or BB) contributes 1/3 and Case 3 contributes 4/6. But adding them gives 1/3 + 4/6 = 1. Which is wrong. Therefore, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, why? Because in this smaller case, if Terry picks RR, then Mary gets BB, which is different. Similarly for BB. Therefore, Case 1 (both RR or both BB) is zero. Wait, no. Wait, Case 1 is both Terry and Mary have RR or both have BB. But in reality, if Terry has RR, Mary cannot have RR, since there are only two reds. Therefore, actually, Case 1 is zero. Similarly for Case 2. Therefore, only Case 3 is non-zero. Therefore, my previous approach is wrong here. Wait, so why did it work in the original problem?\n\nWait, in the original problem, when Terry picks two reds, there are still 8 reds left. So Mary can pick two reds. But in this smaller case, when Terry picks two reds, there are zero reds left. Therefore, Mary cannot pick two reds. Therefore, in my original approach for the original problem, I considered that if Terry picks two reds, Mary can pick two reds (if there are enough left). But in this smaller case, it's different. Therefore, my original approach for the original problem is correct because when Terry picks two reds, there are 8 left, so Mary can pick two. But in this smaller case, Terry picks two reds, Mary cannot. Therefore, why in my calculation for the original problem, I considered Case 1 (both Terry and Mary have two reds) as possible?\n\nAh! Therefore, in my previous calculation for the original problem, I need to make sure that when Terry picks two reds, there are enough reds left for Mary to also pick two reds. Which is true in the original problem because there are 10 reds. But in this smaller case, with only 2 reds, after Terry picks two, there are none left. Therefore, in my general formula, when I calculated for the original problem, I assumed that when Terry picks two reds, there are 8 left, so Mary can pick two. Therefore, my original calculation is correct for the original problem. However, in the smaller case, my approach would have considered:\n\nCase 1: Terry picks two reds: probability C(2,2)/C(4,2)=1/6. Then Mary picks two reds: C(0,2)/C(2,2)= 0. Therefore, contribution is 1/6 * 0 = 0. Similarly for two blues. Case 3: Terry picks one red and one blue: 4/6. Then Mary picks one red and one blue: since after Terry picks one of each, there is 1 red and 1 blue left, so Mary has to pick both, which is one red and one blue. Therefore, probability 1. Therefore, total probability is 0 + 0 + 4/6 * 1 = 4/6 = 2/3, which is correct. Therefore, my original approach was correct. In the original problem, when I calculated Case 1, I had non-zero probabilities because there were enough candies left. Therefore, my calculation for the original problem is correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, 118/323 is correct. Therefore, answer is 118 + 323 = 441.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check with another small example. Let me take 4 red and 4 blue candies. Let me compute the probability using both methods.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, check if 118/323 reduces further. As we saw, 118 is 2*59, 323 is 17*19. No common factors, so yes, reduced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check with decimal values. Let me compute 118 divided by 323. Let me approximate:\n\nWell, 323 × 0.36 = 116.28. 323 × 0.365 = 323*(0.36 + 0.005) = 116.28 + 1.615 = 117.895. Which is very close to 118. Therefore, approximately 0.365. Let me check my original fractions:\n\nOriginal total probability was 10,620 / 29,070 ≈ 0.365. So that seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with another approach. Let me compute the probability that Terry and Mary have the same combination.\n\nThe possible combinations are RR, RB, BB.\n\nProbability they both have RR: [C(10,2)/C(20,2)] * [C(8,2)/C(18,2)] ≈ ?\n\nCompute C(10,2)/C(20,2) = 45/190 ≈ 0.2368.\n\nThen C(8,2)/C(18,2) = 28/153 ≈ 0.1830.\n\nMultiply them: ≈ 0.2368 * 0.183 ≈ 0.0433.\n\nMultiply by 2 (for RR and BB): ≈ 0.0866.\n\nProbability both have RB: [C(10,1)C(10,1)/C(20,2)] * [C(9,1)C(9,1)/C(18,2)] = [100/190] * [81/153] ≈ 0.5263 * 0.5294 ≈ 0.278.\n\nTotal probability ≈ 0.0866 + 0.278 ≈ 0.3646, which is approx 0.365, matching the decimal of 118/323 ≈ 0.365. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the answer is 441.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{441}\n</think>"}
