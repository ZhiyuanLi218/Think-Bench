Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute the product of those numbers: 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, and 61. Maybe if I factor each of them into primes, I can figure out the prime factorization of the total product, which will help me determine how to split them into three distinct numbers a, b, c.\n\nLet me start by factoring each number:\n\n- 11 is prime.\n- 21 is 3 * 7.\n- 31 is prime.\n- 41 is prime.\n- 51 is 3 * 17.\n- 61 is prime.\n\nSo, writing all of them out:\n\n- 11 = 11\n- 21 = 3 * 7\n- 31 = 31\n- 41 = 41\n- 51 = 3 * 17\n- 61 = 61\n\nTherefore, multiplying all together, the total product P is:\n\nP = 11 * (3 * 7) * 31 * 41 * (3 * 17) * 61\n\nLet me combine like terms. The primes involved are:\n\n- 3 appears twice (from 21 and 51)\n- 7, 11, 17, 31, 41, 61 each appear once.\n\nSo the prime factorization of P is:\n\nP = 3² * 7 * 11 * 17 * 31 * 41 * 61\n\nSo now, we need to find the number of sets {a, b, c} of three distinct positive integers such that a * b * c = P.\n\nSince sets are unordered and the numbers must be distinct, I need to count all unique triplets (a, b, c) with a < b < c and a * b * c = P, then multiply by the appropriate combinations if necessary. But maybe there's a better way using the prime factorization.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the number of ways to write a number as a product of three positive integers, considering order, is related to the number of ways to distribute the prime factors among the three numbers. However, since the problem specifies sets {a, b, c} where order doesn't matter and they must be distinct, I need to adjust for overcounting and also ensure that all three numbers are different.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can compute the total number of ordered triples (a, b, c) such that a * b * c = P, then adjust for overcounting and subtract cases where numbers are not distinct.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think in terms of prime exponents. Since P has the prime factors as above, each prime exponent needs to be distributed among a, b, c.\n\nLet me recall that for a number N with prime factorization N = p₁^e₁ * p₂^e₂ * ... * p_k^e_k, the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) with a * b * c = N is equal to the product for each exponent e_i of (number of ways to distribute e_i exponents among three numbers). For each prime, the number of ways is C(e_i + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(e_i + 2, 2). Wait, actually, the formula for distributing e identical items into 3 distinct boxes is C(e + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(e + 2, 2). So for each prime, the number of ways is that combination, and then multiply all together for all primes.\n\nSo in our case, the exponents are:\n\n- For prime 3: exponent 2\n- For primes 7, 11, 17, 31, 41, 61: exponent 1 each.\n\nSo for prime 3: number of ways is C(2 + 2, 2) = C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nFor each prime with exponent 1: number of ways is C(1 + 2, 2) = C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nSince there are 6 primes with exponent 1, the total number of ordered triples is 6 * (3^6). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 3^6 is 729, so 6 * 729 = 4374. So there are 4374 ordered triples (a, b, c) such that a * b * c = P.\n\nBut now, we need to adjust this to count unordered sets {a, b, c} where all three are distinct. So first, let's think about how many ordered triples correspond to each set.\n\nIf all three numbers are distinct, then each set {a, b, c} corresponds to 6 ordered triples (since there are 3! permutations). If two numbers are the same and the third is different, then each such set corresponds to 3 ordered triples. If all three numbers are the same, which is only possible if P is a perfect cube, but since P's prime factorization exponents are 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, which are not all multiples of 3, so there are no such triples where a = b = c. Therefore, all ordered triples either have all distinct numbers or have two the same and one different.\n\nTherefore, to compute the number of unordered sets with distinct elements, we can take the total number of ordered triples, subtract the number of ordered triples with at least two equal numbers, then divide by 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps first compute the number of ordered triples with distinct numbers, then divide by 6.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the total number of ordered triples (which is 4374), subtract the number of ordered triples where at least two numbers are equal, then divide by 6 to get the number of sets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the number of ordered triples with all distinct numbers as follows:\n\nTotal ordered triples: T = 4374.\n\nNumber of ordered triples with at least two equal: Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, number of ordered triples with all three equal: as discussed, zero.\n\nNumber of ordered triples with exactly two equal and one different: ?\n\nTo compute that, we can think as follows: For each possible value of a = b ≠ c, compute how many such ordered triples. Since for each such triple, there are three permutations: (a, a, c), (a, c, a), (c, a, a). However, since we need to count ordered triples, perhaps we can compute the number of solutions where a = b ≠ c, multiplied by 3.\n\nSo let me compute the number of ordered triples with a = b ≠ c.\n\nSo, for a = b ≠ c, we have a² * c = P. So c = P / a². So we need to find the number of integers a such that a² divides P, and then c = P / a² is different from a.\n\nSo first, let me find all integers a such that a² divides P. Then for each such a, check if c = P / a² ≠ a.\n\nSo first, find the number of square divisors of P.\n\nGiven that P has prime factorization 3² * 7¹ * 11¹ * 17¹ * 31¹ * 41¹ * 61¹.\n\nA square divisor must have even exponents for each prime. So for each prime:\n\n- For prime 3: exponent can be 0 or 2 (since original exponent is 2)\n- For primes 7, 11, 17, 31, 41, 61: exponent can only be 0 (since original exponent is 1, can't have 2)\n\nTherefore, the only square divisors are 1 and 3² = 9.\n\nTherefore, there are two square divisors: 1 and 9.\n\nTherefore, the number of a such that a² divides P is 2. Therefore, the number of ordered triples where a = b ≠ c is:\n\nFor each a in {1, 3}, compute c = P / a², then check if c ≠ a.\n\nFirst, for a = 1: c = P / 1² = P. Since P is a huge number (product of several primes), certainly not equal to 1. So c = P ≠ 1. Therefore, this is valid. Then, since the ordered triples are (1, 1, P), (1, P, 1), (P, 1, 1). So three ordered triples.\n\nFor a = 3: c = P / 9. Let me check if c ≠ 3. Since P = 3² * ... other primes..., so P / 9 = (3² / 3²) * ... = product of other primes, which is 7 * 11 * 17 * 31 * 41 * 61. Let me compute that value. Well, regardless of the actual value, since it's a product of primes larger than 3, it's definitely not equal to 3. Therefore, c ≠ 3. Therefore, this also gives three ordered triples: (3, 3, c), (3, c, 3), (c, 3, 3). So three more.\n\nTherefore, total number of ordered triples with exactly two equal numbers is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nTherefore, total number of ordered triples with all distinct numbers is total ordered triples (4374) minus ordered triples with at least two equal (which is 6, since none have all three equal). Therefore, 4374 - 6 = 4368.\n\nTherefore, the number of unordered sets {a, b, c} with distinct elements is 4368 divided by 6 (since each set is counted 6 times in the ordered triples). Therefore, 4368 / 6 = 728.\n\nWait, so the answer is 728? But let me check my steps again because that seems straightforward but maybe I made a mistake.\n\nFirst, total number of ordered triples: 6 * 3^6 = 6 * 729 = 4374. Let me verify that.\n\nFor each prime, the number of ways to distribute exponents among a, b, c. For prime 3 with exponent 2: distributing 2 exponents among 3 variables. The formula is C(2 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(4, 2) = 6. For each prime with exponent 1: distributing 1 exponent among 3 variables: C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3. There are 6 such primes, so 3^6. Multiply by 6 for the prime 3: total is 6 * 3^6 = 6 * 729 = 4374. That seems correct.\n\nThen, number of ordered triples with two equal and one different: 6. Let me check again. The square divisors are only 1 and 9. For each of these, we get three ordered triples. So 2 * 3 = 6. Correct. Therefore, subtracting 6 from 4374 gives 4368 ordered triples with all distinct numbers. Then dividing by 6 gives 728 sets. So the answer is 728?\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are more square divisors. Wait, P is 3² * 7 * 11 * 17 * 31 * 41 * 61. A square divisor must have even exponents. For each prime:\n\n- 3: exponent can be 0 or 2\n- All others: exponent can be 0 or 1, but to be square, they need even exponents, so only 0.\n\nTherefore, square divisors are 3^0 = 1 and 3^2 = 9. Therefore, only two square divisors. Therefore, only a=1 and a=3. Therefore, only two possibilities for a = b. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nBut let me think again: suppose that there are other possibilities where a, b, c are not necessarily with two equal. Wait, but in the case of ordered triples with two equal numbers, we considered a = b ≠ c, but there could also be cases where a = c ≠ b or b = c ≠ a. However, since we are counting ordered triples, when we count a = b ≠ c, we account for all permutations by multiplying by 3. So in our calculation, we found that there are 2 possible a's (1 and 3), each giving rise to three ordered triples, so total 6 ordered triples where two numbers are equal. Therefore, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of sets {a, b, c} is 4368 / 6 = 728. Therefore, the answer is 728?\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Let me take a smaller product and see if my method works.\n\nSuppose P = 2 * 3. Let me find the number of sets {a, b, c} with a*b*c = 6. Wait, but 6 can't be written as a product of three positive integers unless one of them is 1. Let's see:\n\nPossible sets {1, 1, 6}, {1, 2, 3}. But the problem says three distinct positive integers, so {1, 1, 6} is invalid because of duplicates. {1, 2, 3} is valid. So the answer should be 1.\n\nLet me apply my method.\n\nFirst, prime factorization of 6: 2^1 * 3^1.\n\nNumber of ordered triples (a, b, c) with a*b*c = 6.\n\nFor each prime, exponent distribution. For prime 2: exponent 1, number of ways is C(1 + 2, 2) = 3. Same for prime 3: 3. Total ordered triples: 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nNumber of ordered triples with all distinct numbers: ?\n\nFirst, compute square divisors. The square divisors of 6 are 1. Because primes are 2^1 and 3^1. Square divisors need even exponents. So exponents for 2 and 3 can only be 0. So square divisors is 1. Then, for a = 1, c = 6 / 1 = 6. So ordered triples with two equal numbers: (1, 1, 6) and permutations. How many? For a=1, c=6, which is different from a=1. So three ordered triples. Therefore, total ordered triples with two equal numbers is 3. Therefore, total ordered triples with distinct numbers is 9 - 3 = 6. Divided by 6 gives 1 set, which is correct. So that works. Therefore, my method works here.\n\nAnother test case: Let me take P = 8. Let me find the number of sets {a, b, c} with distinct numbers and product 8. The product is 8. Possible sets:\n\nPossible factorizations:\n\n1, 1, 8 – invalid (duplicates)\n\n1, 2, 4 – valid\n\n2, 2, 2 – invalid (duplicates)\n\nSo only one set {1, 2, 4}.\n\nApplying my method:\n\nPrime factorization of 8: 2^3.\n\nNumber of ordered triples: For prime 2, exponent 3. Number of ways is C(3 + 2, 2) = C(5, 2) = 10. So total ordered triples: 10.\n\nNumber of square divisors: divisors of 8 which are squares. 8 is 2^3. Square divisors have exponents even numbers less or equal to 3. So exponents can be 0 or 2. Therefore square divisors: 1 (2^0) and 4 (2^2). Therefore, two square divisors.\n\nFor each square divisor a^2 dividing 8:\n\nFirst, a=1: c = 8 / 1^2 = 8. So ordered triples with (1,1,8) permutations: 3.\n\nSecond, a=2: a^2 = 4 divides 8. c = 8 / 4 = 2. Now check if c ≠ a. Here, c = 2 and a = 2. So c = a. Therefore, the triple would be (2, 2, 2). But since c = a, so all three are equal. However, in our earlier calculation, we considered only cases where exactly two are equal. However, here, when we compute a = b ≠ c, but c equals a, then it's actually all three equal. Therefore, in our previous calculation, when we considered a = b ≠ c, we need to check that c ≠ a. In this case, for a=2, c=2, so it's invalid. Therefore, in this case, only a=1 gives valid ordered triples with two equal numbers. Therefore, number of ordered triples with two equal numbers is 3. Therefore, total ordered triples with distinct numbers is 10 - 3 - number of all equal triples. Since there is one all equal triple (2,2,2). Therefore total ordered triples with distinct numbers is 10 - 3 - 1 = 6. Therefore, number of sets is 6 / 6 = 1, which is correct. However, in my previous method, I subtracted only the ordered triples with two equal numbers (which was 3), but actually, there are also ordered triples with all three equal. Therefore, my previous approach was wrong?\n\nWait, in my original problem, I said that number of ordered triples with at least two equal is 6, but in reality, when I considered a = b ≠ c, I need to exclude cases where c = a. However, in the original problem, when I considered square divisors, for each square divisor a², I had to check if P / a² ≠ a. In the case of P = 8 and a = 2, P / a² = 2, which equals a, so we need to exclude that case. Therefore, in my original problem, when I considered square divisors, I need to check if c ≠ a. In the original problem, for a = 3, c = P / 9. Let me check if c = 3?\n\nOriginal problem: P = 3² * 7 * 11 * 17 * 31 * 41 * 61. For a = 3, c = P / 9 = 7 * 11 * 17 * 31 * 41 * 61, which is definitely not equal to 3, so c ≠ a. Similarly, for a = 1, c = P which is not equal to 1. Therefore, in the original problem, there are no cases where c = a, so all the ordered triples with two equal numbers are valid (i.e., exactly two equal). Therefore, in that case, number of ordered triples with at least two equal numbers is 6, and there are no all three equal triples. However, in the P = 8 case, there was an all three equal triple, so we had to subtract that as well.\n\nTherefore, in general, the formula is:\n\nNumber of ordered triples with all distinct numbers = Total ordered triples - number of ordered triples with at least two equal numbers.\n\nNumber of ordered triples with at least two equal numbers = number of ordered triples with exactly two equal + 3 * number of ordered triples with all three equal. Wait, no:\n\nActually, if you have ordered triples with all three equal, they are counted in the \"at least two equal\" category, but they need to be accounted for. However, in our calculation for exactly two equal numbers, we considered cases where exactly two are equal. Therefore, in general:\n\nNumber of ordered triples with at least two equal = number with exactly two equal + number with all three equal.\n\nBut in our original problem, since there are no triples with all three equal, it was just the number with exactly two equal.\n\nBut in the general case, we need to be careful. However, in our problem, since P is not a perfect cube, there are no triples with all three equal, so it's safe.\n\nTherefore, going back, in our original problem, total number of ordered triples with distinct numbers is 4374 - 6 = 4368. Divided by 6 gives 728. Therefore, answer is 728.\n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe by considering the prime factors.\n\nThe prime factors are 3², 7, 11, 17, 31, 41, 61. So total of 7 primes, with one prime squared.\n\nWe need to distribute these prime factors among three numbers a, b, c. Each prime exponent has to be distributed.\n\nBut since the problem is about sets {a, b, c}, maybe we can model this as a stars and bars problem with some constraints.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to think of the number of ways to partition the multiset of prime factors into three non-empty subsets? Wait, not exactly, since exponents can be distributed.\n\nBut given that the prime factors are 3, 3, 7, 11, 17, 31, 41, 61. So seven primes with one repeated (two 3s). So total eight prime factors? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the prime factorization is 3² * 7 * 11 * 17 * 31 * 41 * 61. So if we think of it as individual prime factors, it's [3, 3, 7, 11, 17, 31, 41, 61]. So eight prime factors, two of which are 3s.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition these eight prime factors into three non-empty subsets (since each of a, b, c must be at least 1, so each must get at least one prime factor? No, actually, they can be 1 if they get no prime factors. Wait, but since we need a, b, c to be positive integers, they can be 1. However, since we need them to be distinct, we need to ensure that after multiplying the primes assigned to each, all three products are distinct.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, maybe this approach can be used with inclusion-exclusion. However, given that I already have an answer via the first method, perhaps I can check consistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the problem as first considering the number of ordered triples, then adjusting for overcounting. But given that my first method worked on the test case, perhaps 728 is correct. However, let me check with another test case where I know the answer.\n\nTake P = 12. Let's find the number of sets {a, b, c} with distinct numbers such that a*b*c = 12.\n\nFirst, factor 12: 2² * 3¹.\n\nTotal number of ordered triples: For prime 2, exponent 2: C(2 + 2, 2) = 6. For prime 3, exponent 1: C(1 + 2, 2) = 3. Total ordered triples: 6 * 3 = 18.\n\nNumber of ordered triples with at least two equal numbers:\n\nSquare divisors of 12: divisors where exponents are even. For prime 2: 0 or 2. For prime 3: 0. Therefore square divisors are 1 and 4.\n\nFor a = 1: c = 12 / 1² = 12. Check if c ≠ a: 12 ≠ 1. Valid. Three ordered triples.\n\nFor a = 2: a² = 4 divides 12. c = 12 / 4 = 3. Check if c ≠ a: 3 ≠ 2. Valid. Three ordered triples.\n\nTherefore total ordered triples with two equal numbers: 3 + 3 = 6. Since 12 is not a cube, no triples with all three equal. Therefore, total ordered triples with distinct numbers: 18 - 6 = 12. Number of sets: 12 / 6 = 2.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nPossible sets {a, b, c} with distinct numbers and product 12.\n\nPossible factorizations:\n\n1, 2, 6\n\n1, 3, 4\n\n2, 2, 3 (invalid due to duplicates)\n\nSo two sets: {1, 2, 6} and {1, 3, 4}. Correct. Therefore, answer is 2. Which matches 12 / 6 = 2. So the method works here. Therefore, my method is correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to original problem, answer is 728.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to think about it. For example, considering that the total number of ordered triples is 6 * 3^6 = 4374. Then, number of sets is (Total - duplicates)/6 + ... But since my test cases worked, I think 728 is correct.\n\nBut let me think again about the square divisors. For the original problem, the square divisors are 1 and 9. For each of these, we have three ordered triples. Therefore, 6 ordered triples with two equal numbers. Therefore, 4374 - 6 = 4368 ordered triples with distinct numbers. Divided by 6 is 728.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the number of unordered triples. But given that my method works on test cases, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 728. Therefore, the number of sets is \\boxed{728}.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose that there are some cases where even though the ordered triples have distinct numbers, when you multiply out the prime factors, two of them might end up being equal? Wait, no. Because the prime factorization is unique. If two numbers ended up being equal, then their prime factors would be the same, which would imply that in the distribution of exponents, the assignments to a and b are the same. However, in our calculation of total ordered triples, we didn't exclude such cases. Wait, but hold on. When we calculated the total number of ordered triples (4374), that includes cases where a, b, c may not be distinct. Therefore, when we subtract the cases where there are two equal numbers (6), we get the number of ordered triples where all three are distinct. Therefore, dividing by 6 gives the number of sets. Therefore, the logic is correct.\n\nBut another way: suppose that there are some ordered triples where all three numbers are distinct, but when you permute them, they are considered the same set. Therefore, dividing by 6 is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 728. Therefore, I will go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{728}\n</think>"}
