Let me start by recalling the formulas related to capacitors.\n\nFirst, the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by C = ε₀A/d, where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, A is the area of the plates, and d is the distance between them. But wait, the problem doesn't mention changing the plate area, so I guess that remains constant here.\n\nThe potential difference U across a capacitor is related to the charge Q and capacitance C by U = Q/C. So if the charge changes and the capacitance changes, the potential difference will depend on both.\n\nThe electric field E between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor can be expressed in two ways. One is E = U/d, where U is the potential difference and d is the plate spacing. Another formula I remember is E = σ/ε₀, where σ is the surface charge density, which is Q/A. So E = Q/(Aε₀). \n\nLet me write down the initial and final conditions.\n\nInitially:\nCharge: Q\nPlate spacing: d\nPotential difference: U₁\nElectric field: E₁\n\nAfter changes:\nCharge: 2Q\nPlate spacing: d/2\nPotential difference: U₂\nElectric field: E₂\n\nOther conditions remain unchanged, so plate area A is the same, and the dielectric (if any) is the same, so ε₀ remains constant.\n\nFirst, let me find expressions for U₁ and E₁.\n\nFor the initial case:\n\nCapacitance C₁ = ε₀A/d\n\nPotential difference U₁ = Q/C₁ = Q / (ε₀A/d) ) = Qd/(ε₀A)\n\nElectric field E₁ can be calculated either by E = U/d or E = σ/ε₀.\n\nUsing E = σ/ε₀: σ = Q/A, so E₁ = Q/(Aε₀). Alternatively, using E = U₁/d: U₁ is Qd/(ε₀A), so dividing by d gives E₁ = Q/(Aε₀). Same result. Good.\n\nNow for the final case:\n\nCharge is 2Q, spacing is d/2.\n\nFirst, let's compute the new capacitance C₂.\n\nC₂ = ε₀A/(d/2) ) = 2ε₀A/d = 2C₁. So the capacitance doubles when the plate spacing is halved.\n\nNow the potential difference U₂ = Q₂ / C₂. Here Q₂ is 2Q. Therefore:\n\nU₂ = 2Q / (2C₁) ) = Q/C₁ = U₁. Wait, that's interesting. So U₂ equals U₁?\n\nBut let me check again. Original U₁ is Q/C₁. New U₂ is 2Q / C₂. Since C₂ is 2C₁, then U₂ = 2Q / (2C₁) ) = Q/C₁ = U₁. Therefore, U₂ = U₁. So the potential difference remains the same?\n\nBut hold on, maybe I need to check using another approach. Let's use the electric field and then compute U from E.\n\nLet me calculate E₂ first. Using E = σ/ε₀. The new charge is 2Q, so σ₂ = 2Q/A. Therefore, E₂ = 2Q/(Aε₀) = 2E₁. Since E₁ was Q/(Aε₀). So E₂ is twice E₁. \n\nAlternatively, using E = U/d. If we don't know U₂ yet, but we know the new spacing is d/2. If we use E₂ = U₂/(d/2) => U₂ = E₂*(d/2). \n\nBut from the previous calculation, if E₂ is 2E₁, then U₂ would be 2E₁*(d/2) = E₁*d. But originally, U₁ was E₁*d. Therefore, U₂ = U₁. Which matches the earlier result. So both methods agree. Therefore, U₂ = U₁ and E₂ = 2E₁. \n\nLooking at the options, option (C) says U₂ = U₁ and E₂ = 2E₁. So option C is correct. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) U₂=U₁, E₂=E₁\n\n(B) U₂=2U₁, E₂=4E₁\n\n(C) U₂=U₁, E₂=2E₁\n\n(D) U₂=2U₁, E₂=2E₁\n\nYes, option C is there. So answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because when we change the charge and the plate spacing, maybe there's another factor I missed? For example, if the capacitor is isolated, changing the plate spacing would affect the capacitance and hence the voltage. But here, since we are changing the charge and the spacing, let me verify again.\n\nOriginal case:\n\nC₁ = ε₀A/d\n\nU₁ = Q/C₁ = Qd/(ε₀A)\n\nE₁ = U₁/d = Q/(ε₀A) which is same as before.\n\nAfter changes:\n\nC₂ = ε₀A/(d/2) = 2ε₀A/d = 2C₁\n\nQ₂ = 2Q\n\nTherefore, U₂ = Q₂/C₂ = 2Q/(2C₁) = Q/C₁ = U₁. Correct.\n\nE₂ can be calculated as U₂/(d/2) = U₁/(d/2) = 2U₁/d. But original E₁ was U₁/d. Therefore, E₂ = 2E₁. Correct. So yes, option C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the electric field in terms of charge and area. Since E is proportional to σ, which is Q/A. Since Q doubled and A is same, σ doubles, so E doubles. Therefore, regardless of the spacing change, E depends only on σ? Wait, but how does changing the spacing come into play here?\n\nWait, if you change the spacing, but keep the charge constant, then the electric field remains the same (since E depends on σ), but the voltage changes because U = E*d. However, in this case, we are changing both the charge and the spacing.\n\nBut in this problem, since charge is doubled and spacing is halved, so when you compute E via σ/ε₀, it's doubled because of the charge. The spacing doesn't affect E in this formula. However, if you compute E via U/d, you need to know how U changes. But since U depends on both C and Q, which in turn depends on d.\n\nBut our calculations show that even though we changed d, the combination of changing Q and C leads to U being the same, so E ends up being 2E₁. So both approaches agree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
