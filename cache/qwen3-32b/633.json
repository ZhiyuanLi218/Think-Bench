The first object has mass m1 and is moving, and the second object is stationary with an unknown mass. The question is asking which of the options A-D is the minimum necessary information needed to find the mass of the second object.\n\nFirst, let me recall what happens in an elastic collision. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. That means I can set up two equations: one for conservation of momentum and one for conservation of kinetic energy. \n\nLet me write those equations down. Let's denote the mass of the second object as m2. The initial velocity of the first object is v1i, and since the second object is stationary, its initial velocity v2i is 0. After the collision, the velocities of the first and second objects will be v1f and v2f respectively.\n\nSo, the conservation of momentum equation would be:\n\nm1 * v1i + m2 * 0 = m1 * v1f + m2 * v2f\n\nSimplifying that, it becomes:\n\nm1 * v1i = m1 * v1f + m2 * v2f  --- Equation (1)\n\nFor kinetic energy conservation:\n\n(1/2) m1 v1i² + (1/2) m2 * 0² = (1/2) m1 v1f² + (1/2) m2 v2f²\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(1/2) m1 v1i² = (1/2) m1 v1f² + (1/2) m2 v2f²\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the 1/2:\n\nm1 v1i² = m1 v1f² + m2 v2f²  --- Equation (2)\n\nSo, we have two equations here with two unknowns if we know m1. The unknowns would be m2, v1f, and v2f. Wait, but if we have two equations, we need to know some of the velocities to solve for m2. The problem says that m1 is known, and m2 is unknown. So, depending on which velocities we know, we can solve for m2.\n\nThe question is asking what is the minimum necessary information. The options are A: final speed of object 1, B: initial speed of object 1, C: final speed of object 2, D: any two of the above.\n\nLet me think. If we have both equations, we can solve for m2. Let me see how that would work. Let's suppose we have some of the velocities given.\n\nFor example, if we know the initial speed of object 1 (option B), that would be v1i. Then, if we also know the final speed of object 1 (option A) and the final speed of object 2 (option C), we could solve for m2. But the question is about the minimum necessary information. So maybe we don't need all three?\n\nWait, but in the equations, if we have two equations (momentum and kinetic energy) and two unknowns (m2 and one of the velocities), but actually, if we know m1, and if we have some velocities, then depending on which velocities we know, we can solve for m2.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says that the second object is initially stationary. So we know v2i = 0. If we can measure some of the final velocities, then we can use the equations to find m2.\n\nLet me try to solve for m2. Let's suppose we have both equations (1) and (2). Let me try to eliminate variables.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nm1(v1i - v1f) = m2 v2f\n\nSo, m2 = [m1(v1i - v1f)] / v2f  --- Equation (3)\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\nm1(v1i² - v1f²) = m2 v2f²\n\nBut v1i² - v1f² factors into (v1i - v1f)(v1i + v1f). So:\n\nm1(v1i - v1f)(v1i + v1f) = m2 v2f²  --- Equation (4)\n\nNow, substitute equation (3) into equation (4):\n\nm1(v1i - v1f)(v1i + v1f) = [m1(v1i - v1f)/v2f] * v2f²\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nm1(v1i - v1f) * v2f\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nm1(v1i - v1f)(v1i + v1f) = m1(v1i - v1f) * v2f\n\nAssuming m1 ≠ 0 and (v1i - v1f) ≠ 0 (which would be the case unless the collision is perfectly inelastic, but it's elastic here, so they don't stick together), we can divide both sides by m1(v1i - v1f):\n\n(v1i + v1f) = v2f\n\nSo, we get that v2f = v1i + v1f. That's a useful relation.\n\nSo, in elastic collisions, there's another relation that comes from combining the conservation laws. In fact, for elastic collisions in one dimension, there's a well-known formula that the relative velocity before and after collision reverses direction. Specifically, v1i - v2i = -(v1f - v2f). Since v2i is 0, this simplifies to v1i = -(v1f - v2f), which rearranges to v2f = v1i + v1f. Exactly what we derived here. So that's a helpful shortcut.\n\nSo, if we have that relation, we can use it to reduce the number of equations. Let me see how that helps us.\n\nSo, if we have that v2f = v1i + v1f, then if we can find either v1f or v2f, we can relate them to each other.\n\nLet me go back to the original question. The question is: In addition to m1, what is the minimum necessary information to determine m2?\n\nSo, m1 is known. The options are about which velocities we need to know.\n\nLet me consider each option.\n\nOption A: The final speed of object 1 (v1f). If we know v1f, can we find m2?\n\nFrom equation (3): m2 = [m1(v1i - v1f)] / v2f. But if we don't know v2f, we can't compute m2. However, from the relation v2f = v1i + v1f, we can express v2f in terms of v1i and v1f. So if we know v1f, and if we also know v1i, then we can compute v2f, and then compute m2.\n\nBut wait, do we know v1i? The problem says \"In addition to m1, what is the minimum necessary information...\" So if we need to know v1i, that would be option B. So if we have both A and B, then we can compute m2. But if we don't know v1i, then knowing just A (v1f) isn't enough because we need v1i as well.\n\nSimilarly, if we have option C: the final speed of object 2 (v2f). Then, again, using equation (3), we need to know v1i and v1f. But if we have v2f and we know v1i, then we can use the relation v2f = v1i + v1f to find v1f, then plug into equation (3) to find m2. Alternatively, if we have v2f and v1f, we can find v1i from the relation v1i = v2f - v1f, but then we need to know v1i? Wait, but the problem is asking what information is needed in addition to m1. So if we have, for example, both v1f and v2f, then we can use the relation v2f = v1i + v1f to solve for v1i. But then, how do we get m2? Let me check.\n\nIf we have both v1f and v2f, then from equation (3): m2 = [m1(v1i - v1f)] / v2f. But if we don't know v1i, we can't compute m2. However, using the relation v2f = v1i + v1f, we can solve for v1i = v2f - v1f. Then substitute into equation (3):\n\nm2 = [m1( (v2f - v1f) - v1f ) ] / v2f = [m1(v2f - 2v1f)] / v2f.\n\nBut unless we have numerical values, this seems like we still have variables. Wait, but if we have numerical values for v1f and v2f, then we can compute v1i, and then compute m2. But in that case, if we have both v1f and v2f, then we can compute m2. So if we have both A and C, then we can compute m2. Alternatively, if we have A and B, or B and C?\n\nLet me check each possibility.\n\nCase 1: If we know B (v1i) and A (v1f). Then, from the relation v2f = v1i + v1f, we can compute v2f. Then, using equation (3), m2 = [m1(v1i - v1f)] / v2f. So yes, with B and A, we can compute m2.\n\nCase 2: If we know B (v1i) and C (v2f). Then, from the relation v2f = v1i + v1f, we can solve for v1f = v2f - v1i. Then, plug into equation (3): m2 = [m1(v1i - (v2f - v1i))]/v2f = [m1(2v1i - v2f)] / v2f. So with B and C, we can compute m2.\n\nCase 3: If we know A (v1f) and C (v2f). Then, from the relation v2f = v1i + v1f, we can solve for v1i = v2f - v1f. Then, plug into equation (3): m2 = [m1( (v2f - v1f) - v1f ) ] / v2f = [m1(v2f - 2v1f)] / v2f. So if we have A and C, we can compute m2. \n\nTherefore, in all cases, if we have any two of the velocities (v1i, v1f, v2f), we can compute m2. However, note that in the problem, the second object is initially stationary, so v2i = 0. Therefore, if we are told that it's an elastic collision, and we know that the second object is initially stationary, then knowing any two of the final velocities and initial velocity would allow us to find the third, and then compute m2. Therefore, the minimum necessary information would be any two of those velocities.\n\nBut let's check the options. The options are:\n\nA: The final speed of object 1\n\nB: The initial speed of object 1\n\nC: The final speed of object 2\n\nD: Any 2 of the above values\n\nSo according to my analysis, if you have any two of A, B, or C, you can determine m2. Therefore, the answer would be D.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let me think again. Suppose we only have one of them, can we determine m2?\n\nSuppose only A: final speed of object 1. Then, we need more information. Because if we don't know v1i or v2f, then we can't compute m2. Similarly, if we only know B: initial speed of object 1. Then, we need to know either final speeds. If we only know C: final speed of object 2, we need to know either initial or final speed of object 1. Therefore, one piece of information is insufficient. Therefore, the minimum necessary is two pieces of information, which is option D.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Let's say m1 is known, and we have an elastic collision. Suppose we know the initial speed of object 1 (B) and the final speed of object 1 (A). Then, we can compute m2 as shown earlier. Similarly, if we know B and C, or A and C, we can compute m2. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the minimum necessary information\". So if there is a case where only one of them is sufficient? Let me think. Suppose we only know B: the initial speed of object 1. Is that enough? No, because we need to know something about the final velocities. Similarly, if we only know A or C, we don't have enough. Therefore, the minimum is two pieces of information. Therefore, D is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where only one is sufficient? Let me think. For example, in some special cases, maybe if you know the initial speed and that the collision is perfectly elastic, but no, even then you need to know how the velocities changed. For example, if you know the initial speed, but not the final speeds, you can't determine m2. Because different masses would result in different final velocities.\n\nWait, but there is another formula for elastic collisions. Let me recall. The formula for the final velocities in an elastic collision when one object is initially at rest.\n\nThe standard formulas are:\n\nFor object 1:\n\nv1f = [(m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2)] * v1i\n\nFor object 2:\n\nv2f = [2m1/(m1 + m2)] * v1i\n\nThese formulas are derived from the conservation laws.\n\nSo if we know, for example, v1f and v1i, we can solve for m2. Let's take the first formula:\n\nv1f = [(m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2)] * v1i\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for m2.\n\nLet me denote x = m2 for simplicity.\n\nv1f / v1i = (m1 - x)/(m1 + x)\n\nCross multiplying:\n\nv1f (m1 + x) = v1i (m1 - x)\n\nExpanding:\n\nv1f m1 + v1f x = v1i m1 - v1i x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nv1f m1 + v1f x - v1i m1 + v1i x = 0\n\nGroup terms:\n\nm1 (v1f - v1i) + x (v1f + v1i) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx (v1f + v1i) = -m1 (v1f - v1i)\n\nTherefore:\n\nx = -m1 (v1f - v1i) / (v1f + v1i)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n- (v1f - v1i) = v1i - v1f\n\nThus:\n\nx = m1 (v1i - v1f) / (v1f + v1i)\n\nTherefore, if we know v1i and v1f, we can compute m2. Therefore, if we have both B and A, we can compute m2. Similarly, if we have v2f and v1i, we can use the second formula:\n\nv2f = [2m1/(m1 + m2)] * v1i\n\nLet me solve for m2 here. Let me denote x = m2 again.\n\nv2f = [2m1/(m1 + x)] * v1i\n\nMultiply both sides by (m1 + x):\n\nv2f (m1 + x) = 2 m1 v1i\n\nExpand:\n\nv2f m1 + v2f x = 2 m1 v1i\n\nRearranged:\n\nv2f x = 2 m1 v1i - v2f m1\n\nFactor right side:\n\nv2f x = m1 (2 v1i - v2f)\n\nTherefore:\n\nx = [m1 (2 v1i - v2f)] / v2f\n\nSo if we know v1i and v2f, we can compute m2. Therefore, if we have B and C, we can compute m2. \n\nNow, what if we have A and C? That is, we know v1f and v2f. Can we compute m2?\n\nYes. Because from the relation v2f = v1i + v1f, we can solve for v1i = v2f - v1f. Then, plug into one of the formulas. For example, using the formula for v1f:\n\nv1f = [(m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2)] * v1i\n\nBut since we can express v1i in terms of v1f and v2f, we can substitute and solve for m2. Alternatively, using the formula for v2f:\n\nv2f = [2m1/(m1 + m2)] * v1i = [2m1/(m1 + m2)] * (v2f - v1f)\n\nThen rearrange to solve for m2. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with:\n\nv2f = [2m1/(m1 + m2)] * (v2f - v1f)\n\nMultiply both sides by (m1 + m2):\n\nv2f (m1 + m2) = 2 m1 (v2f - v1f)\n\nExpand left side:\n\nv2f m1 + v2f m2 = 2 m1 v2f - 2 m1 v1f\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nv2f m1 + v2f m2 - 2 m1 v2f + 2 m1 v1f = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(- m1 v2f) + v2f m2 + 2 m1 v1f = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\nv2f m2 = m1 v2f - 2 m1 v1f\n\nTherefore:\n\nm2 = [m1 v2f - 2 m1 v1f] / v2f = m1 [v2f - 2 v1f]/v2f\n\nWhich is m2 = m1 [1 - 2 v1f / v2f]\n\nSo if we know v1f and v2f, we can compute m2. Therefore, with A and C, we can compute m2. Hence, any two of the three velocities (v1i, v1f, v2f) allows us to compute m2. Therefore, the minimum necessary information is any two of them, which is option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if there's a case where only one is sufficient. For example, suppose you only know the initial speed of object 1 (B), can you determine m2? No, because different masses would result in different outcomes. For example, if m2 is very large, object 1 would just reverse direction with almost the same speed, and object 2 would move very slowly. If m2 is equal to m1, object 1 would stop, and object 2 would move off with speed v1i. If m2 is much smaller, object 1 would keep moving with almost the same speed, and object 2 would be knocked forward with high speed. Therefore, without knowing something about the final velocities, you can't determine m2. Similarly, if you only know the final speed of object 1 (A), you can't determine m2 because depending on m2, the initial speed would affect the result, but you don't know the initial speed. If you only know the final speed of object 2 (C), same problem—you need to know something else to relate it to m2. Therefore, only one piece of information is insufficient, and you need two. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the problem gives you m1. You need to find m2. The collision is elastic. The second object is initially at rest. So you have two equations (momentum and kinetic energy conservation) with three variables: v1i, v1f, v2f. Wait, but actually, if you know m1 and m2 is the unknown, then if you can measure two of the velocities, you can solve for m2. Because with two equations and two unknowns (assuming you know one velocity and m2). Wait, let me think again. Let me consider that m2 is unknown, and you have two equations. If you know one velocity, then you have two equations with two unknowns (another velocity and m2). So you need to know one velocity to have two equations with two unknowns. But then you can solve for both. However, if you know two velocities, then you can solve for m2 with one equation. For example, if you know v1i and v1f, you can use the formula we derived earlier. If you know v1i and v2f, another formula. If you know v1f and v2f, another formula. Therefore, knowing two velocities allows you to determine m2 with one equation. Therefore, the minimum necessary information is two velocities, which is option D. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
