The problem is about three exoplanets with circular orbits, and we need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. The given information includes equilibrium temperature ratios and mass ratios between the planets, as well as an albedo of 0.3 for all. Hmm, so how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = (L/(16πσ))^(1/4) * sqrt(1/(a(1-A))), where L is the stellar luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, a is the semi-major axis (distance from the star), and A is the albedo. But since all planets have the same albedo, maybe we can ignore that part. Also, since we're dealing with ratios between the planets, the constants might cancel out.\n\nSo if I take the ratio of T1 (Planet1) and T2 (Planet2), it's given as 1.4. Let's write that down:\n\nT1 / T2 = 1.4\n\nSimilarly, T2 / T3 = 2.3. But I need to relate this to their orbital periods. Oh, right! The orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. For circular orbits, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed (assuming the star's mass is much larger than the planets, which is probably safe here). So P^2 ∝ a^3. Therefore, if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes between Planet3 and Planet1, I can find the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\nBut how do I get from equilibrium temperature ratios to semi-major axis ratios?\n\nFrom the equilibrium temperature formula, since T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a) (because T ∝ L^(1/4) / sqrt(a)), assuming the star's luminosity is the same for all planets (since they're in the same system), then the ratio of temperatures would be T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Let me check that again.\n\nLet me write the formula again:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). So T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1). Therefore, squaring both sides: (T1 / T2)^2 = a2 / a1. Therefore, a1 / a2 = 1 / (T1/T2)^2.\n\nSimilarly for T2 / T3 = 2.3, then (T2 / T3)^2 = a3 / a2. So a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)^2. Therefore, combining these ratios, the ratio of a3/a1 would be (a3/a2)*(a2/a1) = [(T2/T3)^2] * [1/(T1/T2)^2] ] = (T2^2 / T3^2) * (T2^2 / T1^2) ??? Wait, let me redo that.\n\nWait, if a1/a2 = 1/(T1/T2)^2, then a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2. Similarly, a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2. Therefore, a3/a1 = (a3/a2)*(a2/a1) = (T2/T3)^2 * (T1/T2)^2 = (T1/T3)^2. Wait, that would mean a3/a1 = (T1/T3)^2. But that seems odd. Wait, let me do it step by step.\n\nLet me define T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). Therefore, T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1). Squaring both sides: (T1 / T2)^2 = a2 / a1. Therefore, a1 / a2 = 1 / (T1 / T2)^2. So a1/a2 = (T2 / T1)^2. Similarly, T2 / T3 = sqrt(a3 / a2). Squaring gives (T2 / T3)^2 = a3 / a2. Therefore, a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)^2. Therefore, the ratio of a3/a1 is (a3/a2)*(a2/a1) = [ (T2 / T3)^2 ] * [ 1 / (a1/a2) ]? Wait, no:\n\nWait, a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1). From above, a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2 and a2/a1 is (T1/T2)^2. Therefore:\n\na3/a1 = (T2^2 / T3^2) * (T1^2 / T2^2) ) = T1^2 / T3^2. Therefore, a3/a1 = (T1 / T3)^2. Therefore, the semi-major axis ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 is (T1 / T3)^2. \n\nBut then how do I find T1 / T3? Well, given that T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3, then T1/T3 = (T1/T2)*(T2/T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22. Therefore, a3/a1 = (3.22)^2 ≈ 10.3684. So the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.\n\nThen, using Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ a^3. Therefore, (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3. Therefore, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 10.37^(1/2) is sqrt(10.37) ≈ 3.22. Then, 10.37^(3/2) = 10.37 * 3.22 ≈ Let's compute 10 * 3.22 = 32.2 and 0.37 * 3.22 ≈ 1.1914. Total ≈ 32.2 + 1.19 ≈ 33.39. So approximately 33.4. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1. Which is option D: ~33.4.\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions the mass ratios. The question says \"By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1...\" but I didn't use the mass ratios. Did I miss something here?\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the mass of the planets? But Kepler's third law in the form P^2 ∝ a^3 is for a planet orbiting a star where the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. If the planets have significant mass, then the formula would involve the sum of the star's mass and the planet's mass. However, since we are dealing with ratios between the planets, and assuming that the star's mass is much larger than any of the planets, the planetary masses would not affect the orbital periods. Therefore, the mass ratios given (Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15, Planet2/Planet3 = 1.35) might be a red herring, or perhaps they are there to test if we get confused.\n\nBut why would they give us the mass ratios then? Maybe there's another aspect? Wait, the problem says the planets were discovered through the TTV method. TTV is transit timing variations, which can be affected by the gravitational interactions between planets. However, the question is about the orbital periods based on equilibrium temperature and albedo. Since the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, and the orbital period depends on that distance via Kepler's law, unless there's some other factor... Maybe I need to consider if the mass affects the equilibrium temperature? But no, equilibrium temperature is about the energy received from the star, so it's independent of the planet's mass. Therefore, the mass ratios are probably irrelevant here.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is D: ~33.4. But let me check again my steps.\n\nFirst, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a), so T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) → a1 / a2 = (T2 / T1)^2. Similarly for T2 / T3. Then combining to get a3 / a1 = (T1 / T3)^2. Then T1 / T3 = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22. Therefore, a3 / a1 = (3.22)^2 ≈ 10.368. Then P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.368)^(3/2). Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nFirst, sqrt(10.368) is indeed approximately 3.22. Let me check 3.22^2 = 10.3684, yes. So 10.368^(3/2) = 10.368 * 3.22. Let me compute that:\n\n10 * 3.22 = 32.2\n\n0.368 * 3.22 ≈ 0.368 * 3 + 0.368 * 0.22 ≈ 1.104 + 0.08096 ≈ 1.18496\n\nTotal ≈ 32.2 + 1.18496 ≈ 33.38496. So approximately 33.4. So that's option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: ~33.4. The mass ratios were probably there to possibly confuse or for a different part of the problem not needed here. Since the question is about orbital period based on equilibrium temperature and albedo, which relates to the semi-major axis via the equilibrium temperature formula and then to orbital period via Kepler's law. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
