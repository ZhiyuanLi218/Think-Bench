Let me start by recalling what vertical and horizontal asymptotes are.\n\nVertical asymptotes occur where the function is undefined because the denominator is zero, right? So I need to factor the denominator and find its roots. The denominator here is x² - 5x - 14. Let me try to factor that quadratic. Hmm, I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let me think... Let's see, factors of 14 are 1 and 14, 2 and 7. If I take -7 and +2, then -7 * +2 = -14, and -7 + 2 = -5. Yes, that works! So the denominator factors as (x - 7)(x + 2). Therefore, the denominator is zero when x = 7 or x = -2. So those are the vertical asymptotes. Therefore, a and b are 7 and -2. Let me check that again. If I plug in x = 7: 7² - 5*7 -14 = 49 - 35 -14 = 0. Similarly, x = -2: (-2)^2 -5*(-2) -14 = 4 +10 -14 = 0. Yep, that's correct. So vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7. Therefore, a is -2 and b is 7, or vice versa. But since we need a + b, it doesn't matter which is which. So a + b is (-2) + 7 = 5. Got that part.\n\nNow, the horizontal asymptote. For rational functions, horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator here is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² -5x -14, which is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Wait, let me confirm. If the degrees are different, the rule is: if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the numerator is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote (but maybe an oblique one). Here, numerator degree 1, denominator degree 2. So yes, horizontal asymptote at y = 0. Therefore, c = 0. Therefore, a + b + c is 5 + 0 = 5. So the answer is 5? Let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me double-check the horizontal asymptote. Maybe I made a mistake there? Let me think. For large x, the function behaves like 2x / x² = 2/x, which approaches 0 as x approaches positive or negative infinity. So yes, y = 0 is indeed the horizontal asymptote. Therefore, c = 0. Therefore, adding them up: a + b + c is (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5. Seems straightforward. \n\nBut let me check if there's any possibility I messed up the vertical asymptotes. The denominator factors to (x - 7)(x + 2). So zeros at 7 and -2. The numerator is 2x, which is zero at x = 0. So there's no cancellation here, since 0 isn't equal to 7 or -2. Therefore, no holes in the graph, just vertical asymptotes at those two points. So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the quadratic formula to solve x² -5x -14 = 0? Let me do that to confirm. The quadratic formula is x = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 56)] / 2. Since the quadratic is ax² + bx + c, so here a = 1, b = -5, c = -14. Therefore discriminant is b² - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14) = 25 + 56 = 81. Square root of 81 is 9. Therefore, x = [5 ± 9]/2. So that gives (5 + 9)/2 = 14/2 = 7, and (5 - 9)/2 = (-4)/2 = -2. Yep, same answers. So vertical asymptotes at x = 7 and x = -2. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, adding them up, -2 + 7 = 5, plus horizontal asymptote 0, total is 5. Therefore, the answer is 5. Seems straightforward. I don't see any mistakes here. Maybe I can check with a graph? Well, since I can't graph right now, but I can think about the behavior. For example, as x approaches 7 from the right, denominator approaches 0 from positive side (since near x=7, let's say x = 7.1, denominator is (7.1 -7)(7.1 + 2) = 0.1 * 9.1 = positive, numerator is 2*7.1 = positive, so f(x) approaches +infty. Similarly from left, x approaches 7 from left, say 6.9, denominator (6.9 -7)= -0.1, (6.9 + 2) = 8.9, so denominator negative, numerator positive, so approaches -infty. Similarly for x approaching -2 from right and left. So vertical asymptotes are correct. And horizontal asymptote y=0 makes sense because as x becomes very large, the function tends to zero. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. So a + b + c is 5 + 0 = 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ a + b + c $ is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>"}
