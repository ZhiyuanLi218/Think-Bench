The problem says that satellite P has an orbital radius about 16 times the Earth's radius, and satellite Q has an orbital radius about 4 times the Earth's radius. The question is asking for the ratio of their periods, T_P to T_Q. The options are from (A) 2:1 up to (D) 16:1.\n\nHmm, I remember that there's a law related to the orbital periods and radii of satellites. Oh right, Kepler's Third Law! I think it states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. So, mathematically, T² ∝ r³. That means if I have two satellites orbiting the same planet (in this case, Earth), the ratio of their periods can be found by taking the square root of the ratio of the cubes of their orbital radii.\n\nLet me write that down. For two satellites, Kepler's Third Law can be written as:\n\n(T_P / T_Q)² = (r_P / r_Q)³\n\nSo solving for T_P / T_Q, it would be the square root of (r_P / r_Q)³.\n\nGiven that r_P is 16 times Earth's radius and r_Q is 4 times Earth's radius, the ratio r_P / r_Q is 16 / 4, which simplifies to 4. So substituting into the equation:\n\n(T_P / T_Q)² = (4)³ = 64\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives T_P / T_Q = √64 = 8. Therefore, the ratio of the periods is 8:1, which should correspond to option (C).\n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. Let me verify the steps again. Kepler's Third Law: T² is proportional to r³. So if I take the ratio of T_P squared over T_Q squared equals (r_P / r_Q)^3. So yes, that's correct. The ratio of radii is 16R / 4R = 4. Then 4 cubed is 64. Square root of 64 is 8. So T_P is 8 times T_Q. Therefore, the ratio T_P:T_Q is 8:1. So option (C).\n\nIs there any chance I messed up the exponents? Let me think. The law is T² ∝ r³. So if I have T_P² / T_Q² = r_P³ / r_Q³. Therefore, T_P / T_Q = (r_P / r_Q)^(3/2). Which is the same as sqrt( (r_P / r_Q)^3 ). So yes, that's what I did. So for r_P / r_Q = 4, then 4^(3/2). 4^(1/2) is 2, and 4^3 is 64. Wait, no, 4^(3/2) is (sqrt(4))^3, which is 2^3 = 8. Alternatively, it can be (4^3)^(1/2) which is 64^(1/2) = 8. Either way, same result. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of the formula for the period. The orbital period can be found from the formula T = 2π√(r³/(GM)), where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the Earth. Since both satellites are orbiting Earth, GM is the same for both. Therefore, T is proportional to r^(3/2). Therefore, the ratio T_P / T_Q = (r_P / r_Q)^(3/2) = (16R / 4R)^(3/2) = (4)^(3/2) = 8. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo regardless of the approach, the ratio is 8:1, which is option (C). Therefore, the correct answer should be (C).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
