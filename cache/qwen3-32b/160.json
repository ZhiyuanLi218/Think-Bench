Since factorials involve multiplying all integers from 1 to $n$, we are essentially counting how many times the factor 10 appears in the product.\n\nHowever, because there are typically more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation\n\nWe use a standard method to count the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

Hmm, I remember that trailing zeros in a factorial come from factors of 10, which are made by multiplying 2 and 5. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros should depend on the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!. Let me confirm if that's the right approach.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for finding trailing zeros in a factorial. I think it's something like taking the floor division of the number by 5, then by 25, 125, etc., until the division result is zero, and then adding all those up. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So for 42!, I need to calculate how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\nLet me write that down step by step. The formula is:\n\nNumber of trailing zeros = floor(42/5) + floor(42/25) + floor(42/125) + ...\n\nSince 125 is already larger than 42, the next term would be zero and can be ignored. Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: floor(42/5). Let me divide 42 by 5. 5*8 is 40, so 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, and taking the floor gives 8. So that's 8.\n\nSecond term: floor(42/25). 25 goes into 42 once, since 25*1=25 and 25*2=50 which is too big. So 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, floor is 1. So that's 1.\n\nThird term: floor(42/125). 125 is bigger than 42, so this is 0. So we can stop here.\n\nAdding them up: 8 + 1 + 0 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n\nWait, let me check if this is correct. Maybe I should verify with a smaller factorial where I know the answer. For example, 5! is 120, which has one trailing zero. Applying the formula: floor(5/5) + floor(5/25) + ... = 1 + 0 + ... = 1. Correct. How about 10!? 10/5 = 2, 10/25 = 0. So 2 trailing zeros. 10! is 3628800, which has two zeros. Correct. Let me check 25!. According to the formula, floor(25/5)=5, floor(25/25)=1, total 6. Let me see... 25! has 6 trailing zeros. That seems right because 5, 10, 15, 20 each contribute one 5, and 25 contributes an extra one. So yes, 5+1=6. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, applying it to 42! gives 8 + 1 = 9. Let me think again about why this works. Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, but numbers like 25, 50, etc., contribute two 5s because they are 5 squared. Similarly, 125 would contribute three 5s, but since 125 is larger than 42, we don't have to consider it here. Therefore, by dividing by 5, 25, 125, etc., we account for all the 5s in the factors. And since there are more than enough 2s, the number of 5s is the limiting factor for the number of 10s, hence the number of trailing zeros.\n\nWait, let me check if there's any mistake in my calculation for 42. Let me compute floor(42/5). 5*8 is 40, so 8. Then floor(42/25). 25*1 is 25, 25*2 is 50 which is more than 42, so 1. Then floor(42/125) is 0. So 8+1=9. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me list all the multiples of 5 in 42! and count how many 5s they contribute.\n\nMultiples of 5 between 1 and 42 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers. Each of these contributes at least one 5. Now, among these, the numbers 25, 50, 75, etc., contribute an extra 5. But in our case, only 25 is present (since 25*2=50 is beyond 42). So 25 contributes an additional 5. Therefore, total number of 5s is 8 + 1 = 9. Hence, confirming the earlier result. \n\nTherefore, the number of trailing zeros is indeed 9. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, maybe I can compute 42! and check? Although computing 42! manually would be tedious. Let me try to compute how big 42! is. Well, I know that 10! is 3.6 million, 20! is about 2.4e18, 30! is about 2.6e32, and 40! is about 8.1e47. So 42! is 42×41×40! which would be 42×41×8.1e47 ≈ 42×41×8.1e47. Let me compute 42×41 first. 40×41=1640, 2×41=82, total 1640+82=1722. So 1722×8.1e47 ≈ 13948.2e47 = 1.39482e51. So 42! is approximately 1.4e51. But how does that help me? Well, I can't really check the exact number of zeros without the actual value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. For example, using logarithms to estimate the number of digits? Wait, no, that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can use programming? But since I can't run code here, maybe I can cross-verify with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, think about the exact count of 5s and 2s. For example, number of 2s in 42! is floor(42/2) + floor(42/4) + floor(42/8) + floor(42/16) + floor(42/32) + ... Let me compute that:\n\nfloor(42/2)=21\n\nfloor(42/4)=10\n\nfloor(42/8)=5\n\nfloor(42/16)=2\n\nfloor(42/32)=1\n\nfloor(42/64)=0. So adding those up: 21+10+5+2+1=39. So there are 39 factors of 2. And as we found earlier, there are 9 factors of 5. Therefore, since each 10 requires one 2 and one 5, the number of 10s is limited by the number of 5s, which is 9. Therefore, there are 9 trailing zeros. \n\nTherefore, this cross-check with the number of 2s shows that there are indeed more 2s than 5s (39 vs 9), so our original conclusion is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 9. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the number of 5s. Let me recount:\n\nNumbers divisible by 5 between 1-42:\n\n5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40. That's 8 numbers. Each contributes one 5, except 25 which contributes an extra. So total is 8 +1=9. Correct. \n\nAlternatively, if there was another multiple of 25? Let's see. 25*2=50, which is beyond 42, so no. Therefore, only 25 contributes an extra. Hence, total 9. \n\nTherefore, I think I can be confident that the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of trailing zeros in $42!$ is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>"}
