Let me write that down first to make sure I have it right: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, so my goal is to find all real numbers x that satisfy this equation. \n\nHmm, square roots can sometimes be tricky because they can introduce extraneous solutions if I'm not careful. I remember that when dealing with equations involving square roots, it's often helpful to isolate the radical and then square both sides to eliminate it. But before I do that, let me check if there's anything else I need to consider. \n\nFirst, the square root function √(something) is only defined for non-negative values, so whatever is inside the square root, which is 11 - 2x, must be greater than or equal to zero. Let me write that down as a condition: 11 - 2x ≥ 0. Solving for x, that would mean -2x ≥ -11. Dividing both sides by -2, which is a negative number, so I need to reverse the inequality sign. Therefore, x ≤ 11/2. So x has to be less than or equal to 5.5. That's a restriction I need to keep in mind when checking solutions later. \n\nAlso, since the square root itself is always non-negative, √(11 - 2x) ≥ 0. Therefore, the right-hand side of the equation, which is √(11 - 2x) + 4, must be at least 4. Therefore, the left-hand side, which is x, must also be at least 4. So another condition is x ≥ 4. \n\nSo combining both conditions, x has to be between 4 and 5.5 inclusive. So any solution I find must lie in that interval. If I get a solution outside of that, I can immediately discard it. \n\nOkay, so now let me try to solve the equation. Let me rewrite it again:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nTo isolate the square root, I can subtract 4 from both sides:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x).\n\nNow the square root is by itself on the right. Now I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me do that:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = [√(11 - 2x)]^2.\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x - 4)^2 = x² - 8x + 16.\n\nRight side: [√(11 - 2x)]^2 = 11 - 2x.\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.\n\nNow let me bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nx² - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nSo the quadratic equation is x² - 6x + 5 = 0. Let me check my algebra here to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x. Expanding left side: x² - 8x + 16. Then subtract 11 and add 2x: x² -8x +16 -11 +2x = x² -6x +5. Yes, that seems right. \n\nNow, solving x² -6x +5 = 0. Let me factor this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add to -6. Since 5 is positive and the middle term is negative, both numbers must be negative. Factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So -1 and -5 multiply to 5 and add to -6. Perfect. Therefore, the quadratic factors as:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0? Wait, hold on. Wait, if the factors are (x - 1)(x - 5), that would expand to x² -6x +5? Let me check:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = x² -5x -x +5 = x² -6x +5. Yes, correct. So the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. \n\nBut wait, earlier we had conditions that x must be between 4 and 5.5. So x = 1 is less than 4, which violates our earlier condition. Therefore, x = 1 is an extraneous solution and must be rejected. The other solution is x = 5, which is within the interval [4, 5.5], so we need to check if it satisfies the original equation. \n\nBut before I do that, let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I squared both sides of the equation, which can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so it's essential to check the solutions in the original equation. \n\nSo let me check x = 5 in the original equation:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS): x = 5.\n\nRight-hand side (RHS): √(11 - 2x) + 4. Let's compute 11 - 2x when x = 5: 11 - 10 = 1. Then √1 = 1. Therefore, RHS = 1 + 4 = 5. Which equals LHS. So x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nNow check x = 1:\n\nLHS: x = 1.\n\nRHS: √(11 - 2(1)) + 4 = √(11 - 2) + 4 = √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7. Which is not equal to 1. So x = 1 is indeed extraneous and must be discarded. \n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 5. \n\nBut let me just double-check my work again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nOriginal equation: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nIsolating radical: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x).\n\nSquaring both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x.\n\nExpanding left side: x² -8x +16 = 11 - 2x.\n\nBringing all terms to left: x² -8x +16 -11 +2x = x² -6x +5 = 0. Correct.\n\nFactoring: (x - 1)(x -5) = 0. Correct.\n\nSolutions x=1 and x=5. Checking x=5 is valid, x=1 is not. \n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When I squared both sides of the equation, I might have introduced an extraneous solution, which we saw was x=1. But is there a possibility that I missed another solution? Let me think. \n\nThe original equation is x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Since we had already considered the domain restrictions (x between 4 and 5.5), and after solving the quadratic, only x=5 is in that interval. So unless there's another solution in that interval, which I don't think so because the quadratic only gave us two solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try solving the equation another way to verify. Let me try substituting y = √(11 - 2x). Then according to the original equation, x = y + 4. \n\nSo, since y = √(11 - 2x), then squaring both sides gives y² = 11 - 2x. But since x = y + 4, substitute that into the equation:\n\ny² = 11 - 2(y + 4) = 11 - 2y - 8 = 3 - 2y.\n\nTherefore, y² + 2y - 3 = 0. \n\nSolving this quadratic equation for y: y² + 2y - 3 = 0. Let's factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to 2. Those numbers are 3 and -1. Therefore, (y + 3)(y - 1) = 0. Therefore, y = -3 or y = 1. \n\nBut since y = √(11 - 2x), and square roots are non-negative, y must be ≥ 0. Therefore, y = -3 is invalid, leaving y = 1 as the only solution. \n\nTherefore, y = 1, so x = y + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. Which is the same solution as before. \n\nThis method also leads to x = 5, so that's reassuring. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can graph both sides of the original equation to see where they intersect. The left side is the line y = x. The right side is y = √(11 - 2x) + 4. \n\nTo find the intersection points, we can analyze their behavior. \n\nFirst, the domain for the right side is x ≤ 5.5 as established before. Also, since √(11 - 2x) is decreasing as x increases (because as x increases, 11 - 2x decreases), so y = √(11 - 2x) + 4 is a decreasing function. \n\nAt x = 4, √(11 - 8) + 4 = √3 + 4 ≈ 1.732 + 4 ≈ 5.732. \n\nAt x = 5, √(11 - 10) + 4 = √1 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. \n\nAt x approaching 5.5 from the left, 11 - 2x approaches 11 - 11 = 0, so √(0) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4. \n\nTherefore, the right-hand side starts at x approaching negative infinity? Wait, no, the domain is x ≤ 5.5. Let me check when x approaches negative infinity, but actually, since x must be ≥ 4 as per earlier conditions, the domain we care about is x ∈ [4, 5.5]. \n\nSo in this interval, the right-hand side decreases from approximately 5.732 at x = 4 to 4 at x = 5.5. The left-hand side, y = x, increases from 4 to 5.5 in this interval. Therefore, they must intersect exactly once in this interval. Since we found x = 5 as a solution, which is in the middle of the interval, and given the functions are monotonic (one increasing, one decreasing), there should be exactly one solution. Therefore, x = 5 is the only solution. \n\nThis gives me more confidence that x = 5 is the correct solution. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me test another value in the interval to see how the functions behave. Let's take x = 5. \n\nOriginal equation: 5 vs √(11 - 10) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. Correct. \n\nTake x = 4. Let's see: LHS is 4. RHS is √(11 - 8) + 4 = √3 + 4 ≈ 5.732. So LHS (4) is less than RHS (~5.732). \n\nTake x = 5.5: LHS is 5.5. RHS is √(11 - 11) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4. So LHS (5.5) is greater than RHS (4). \n\nTherefore, since LHS increases from 4 to 5.5 and RHS decreases from ~5.732 to 4, they cross somewhere in between. Since we found x = 5 is the crossing point, and the functions are continuous, there's exactly one solution. \n\nTherefore, I think I can be confident that x = 5 is the only solution. \n\nBut just to recap all steps once more:\n\nOriginal equation: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nStep 1: Determine domain. The expression under the square root must be non-negative: 11 - 2x ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≤ 5.5. Also, since square root is non-negative, √(11 - 2x) ≥ 0 ⇒ √(11 - 2x) + 4 ≥ 4 ⇒ x ≥ 4. Therefore, domain is 4 ≤ x ≤ 5.5.\n\nStep 2: Isolate radical. Subtract 4: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x).\n\nStep 3: Square both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x ⇒ x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x ⇒ x² -6x +5 = 0.\n\nStep 4: Solve quadratic equation: x = 1 and x = 5.\n\nStep 5: Check solutions against domain and original equation. x = 1 is outside the domain [4, 5.5], so reject. x = 5 is within domain and satisfies original equation. \n\nTherefore, solution is x = 5.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. The key steps were correctly isolating the radical, squaring both sides, solving the quadratic, and checking the solutions against the domain and original equation. The alternative methods (substitution and analyzing functions) also confirm the same result. \n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the only solution is x = 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ x $ that satisfies the equation is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>"}
