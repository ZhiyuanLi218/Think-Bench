Let me try to visualize this. First, he walks 1/2 mile south. Then 3/4 mile east, and then another 1/2 mile south. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me think about the directions. If he starts at a point, let's say his starting position is (0,0) on a coordinate system where east is the positive x-direction and north is the positive y-direction. So south would be negative y-direction. \n\nSo first, he walks 1/2 mile south. That would take him from (0,0) to (0, -1/2). Then he walks 3/4 mile east. So from (0, -1/2), moving east (positive x-direction) by 3/4 mile would take him to (3/4, -1/2). Then he walks another 1/2 mile south. So from (3/4, -1/2), moving south (negative y-direction) another 1/2 mile would take him to (3/4, -1/2 - 1/2) = (3/4, -1). \n\nSo now, his final position is at (3/4, -1). The starting point was (0,0). So the straight-line distance between these two points can be found using the distance formula. The distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: sqrt[(3/4 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(9/16) + 1]. Wait, let me check that again. \n\nFirst, (3/4)^2 is 9/16. Then (-1)^2 is 1. So adding those together: 9/16 + 1. But 1 is 16/16, so total is 25/16. Then the square root of 25/16 is 5/4. Which is 1.25. \n\nWait, so the straight-line distance is 1.25 miles? Let me verify that again. \n\nStarting at (0,0). After first move: (0, -0.5). Then moving east 0.75, so x-coordinate becomes 0.75, y remains -0.5. Then moving south another 0.5, so y-coordinate becomes -0.5 - 0.5 = -1.0. So final coordinates (0.75, -1.0). \n\nDistance from origin: sqrt( (0.75)^2 + (-1.0)^2 ) = sqrt(0.5625 + 1.0) = sqrt(1.5625). What's sqrt(1.5625)? Let me calculate that. \n\nWell, 1.25 squared is 1.5625 because 1.2^2 is 1.44 and 0.25^2 is 0.0625, and cross term 2*1.2*0.25 = 0.6. So total (1.2 + 0.25)^2 is 1.44 + 0.6 + 0.0625 = 2.1... Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, 1.25 squared is (5/4)^2 = 25/16 = 1.5625. Yes, exactly. So sqrt(25/16) is 5/4, which is 1.25. \n\nSo 1.25 miles. But the question says to express the answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. 1.25 is already to the nearest hundredth, since it's 1.250... So 1.25. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate system? Let me check again. \n\nIf he walks south twice, total southward distance is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 mile. Then eastward distance is 3/4 mile. So if you imagine a right triangle where one leg is 1 mile (south) and the other leg is 3/4 mile (east), then the straight-line distance is hypotenuse. \n\nYes, so Pythagorean theorem: sqrt( (1)^2 + (3/4)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 9/16) = sqrt(25/16) = 5/4. So same result. \n\nTherefore, 5/4 is 1.25. So the answer is 1.25 miles. \n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a trick here. For example, sometimes problems involve direction changes or something else, but here it seems straightforward. He walks south, then east, then south again. So total south is 1 mile, east is 3/4 mile. So displacement is sqrt( (1)^2 + (0.75)^2 ). \n\nYes, which is 1.25. \n\nAlternatively, converting fractions to decimals early on. \n\nFirst, 1/2 mile south is 0.5 miles south. Then 3/4 mile east is 0.75 miles east. Then another 0.5 miles south. Total south is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0 miles. East is 0.75 miles. So same as above. \n\nSo distance is sqrt(1.0^2 + 0.75^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.5625) = sqrt(1.5625) = 1.25. \n\nYes. So the answer is 1.25. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, which it already is. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.25. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1.25}\n</think>"}
