The polynomial is given as $ P(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^{17})^2 - x^{17} $. They mention that there are 34 complex roots, each expressed in polar form with angles $ a_k $, and I need to find the sum $ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 $ where these $ a_k $ are ordered from smallest to largest. The answer should be in the form $ m/n $ where $ m $ and $ n $ are coprime, and then give $ m + n $. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand the polynomial. The first part is $ (1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^{17})^2 $. That looks like a geometric series squared. I remember that the sum of a geometric series $ 1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^n $ is $ \\frac{x^{n+1} - 1}{x - 1} $, right? So in this case, the sum up to $ x^{17} $ would be $ \\frac{x^{18} - 1}{x - 1} $. Therefore, the square of that would be $ \\left( \\frac{x^{18} - 1}{x - 1} \\right)^2 $. \n\nSo then the polynomial $ P(x) $ is $ \\left( \\frac{x^{18} - 1}{x - 1} \\right)^2 - x^{17} $. Maybe I can simplify this expression? Let me write that out:\n\n$ P(x) = \\left( \\frac{x^{18} - 1}{x - 1} \\right)^2 - x^{17} $.\n\nBut before I go further, maybe I should check if there's another way to write the original polynomial. The original is $ (1 + x + \\cdots + x^{17})^2 - x^{17} $. Let me think about expanding that square. The square of the sum would be the sum of all products $ x^i x^j $ for $ 0 \\leq i, j \\leq 17 $. So that would be $ \\sum_{i=0}^{17} \\sum_{j=0}^{17} x^{i + j} $. Then subtracting $ x^{17} $. \n\nBut maybe that's not helpful. Let me go back to the expression with the geometric series. Let me compute $ \\left( \\frac{x^{18} - 1}{x - 1} \\right)^2 - x^{17} $. Let me combine these terms over a common denominator. Let me first compute $ \\left( \\frac{x^{18} - 1}{x - 1} \\right)^2 $. Let me denote that as $ \\frac{(x^{18} - 1)^2}{(x - 1)^2} $. Then subtracting $ x^{17} $ would give:\n\n$ \\frac{(x^{18} - 1)^2 - x^{17}(x - 1)^2}{(x - 1)^2} $.\n\nSo $ P(x) = \\frac{(x^{18} - 1)^2 - x^{17}(x - 1)^2}{(x - 1)^2} $. Therefore, the roots of $ P(x) $ are the roots of the numerator, excluding any roots that make the denominator zero. The denominator is $ (x - 1)^2 $, so $ x = 1 $ would be excluded. But let's check if $ x = 1 $ is a root of the numerator.\n\nLet me plug $ x = 1 $ into the numerator:\n\n$ (1^{18} - 1)^2 - 1^{17}(1 - 1)^2 = (0)^2 - 1*(0)^2 = 0 $. So actually, $ x = 1 $ is a root of the numerator. Therefore, we need to check the multiplicity. Let me compute the numerator:\n\nLet me denote numerator as $ N(x) = (x^{18} - 1)^2 - x^{17}(x - 1)^2 $. Let me expand this:\n\nFirst, expand $ (x^{18} - 1)^2 $:\n\n$ x^{36} - 2x^{18} + 1 $.\n\nThen expand $ x^{17}(x - 1)^2 $:\n\nFirst compute $ (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 $, then multiply by $ x^{17} $:\n\n$ x^{19} - 2x^{18} + x^{17} $.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is:\n\n$ x^{36} - 2x^{18} + 1 - (x^{19} - 2x^{18} + x^{17}) $.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- $ x^{36} $\n- $ -2x^{18} + 2x^{18} = 0 $\n- $ +1 $\n- $ -x^{19} $\n- $ -x^{17} $\n\nSo overall:\n\n$ N(x) = x^{36} - x^{19} - x^{17} + 1 $.\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to $ x^{36} - x^{19} - x^{17} + 1 $. Let me check that again. Starting from:\n\nOriginal numerator: $ (x^{18} - 1)^2 - x^{17}(x - 1)^2 $.\n\nExpanding:\n\n$ x^{36} - 2x^{18} + 1 - [x^{19} - 2x^{18} + x^{17}] $.\n\nYes, that becomes $ x^{36} - 2x^{18} + 1 - x^{19} + 2x^{18} - x^{17} $, which simplifies to $ x^{36} - x^{19} - x^{17} + 1 $. Correct.\n\nSo $ N(x) = x^{36} - x^{19} - x^{17} + 1 $. Maybe we can factor this? Let me try to factor it. Let me see if there's a way to factor by grouping.\n\nLooking at $ x^{36} - x^{19} - x^{17} + 1 $. Let me group terms:\n\nGroup $ x^{36} - x^{19} $ and $ -x^{17} + 1 $:\n\n$ x^{19}(x^{17} - 1) -1(x^{17} - 1) $.\n\nAh! That's nice. So factoring $ (x^{17} - 1) $:\n\n$ (x^{19} - 1)(x^{17} - 1) $. Wait, let me check:\n\n$ (x^{19} - 1)(x^{17} - 1) = x^{36} - x^{19} - x^{17} + 1 $. Yes, exactly. So the numerator factors as $ (x^{19} - 1)(x^{17} - 1) $. \n\nTherefore, $ N(x) = (x^{19} - 1)(x^{17} - 1) $. Therefore, the polynomial $ P(x) $ is:\n\n$ P(x) = \\frac{(x^{19} - 1)(x^{17} - 1)}{(x - 1)^2} $.\n\nBut we need to simplify this further. Let me note that $ x^{19} - 1 $ factors as $ (x - 1)(x^{18} + x^{17} + \\cdots + 1) $, and similarly $ x^{17} - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{16} + x^{15} + \\cdots + 1) $. Therefore, the numerator factors as $ (x - 1)^2 \\times [ (x^{18} + x^{17} + \\cdots + 1)(x^{16} + x^{15} + \\cdots + 1) ] $. Therefore, when we divide by $ (x - 1)^2 $, we get:\n\n$ P(x) = (x^{18} + x^{17} + \\cdots + 1)(x^{16} + x^{15} + \\cdots + 1) $.\n\nBut wait, the original expression for $ P(x) $ was $ (1 + x + \\cdots + x^{17})^2 - x^{17} $. Let me check if this is equivalent to the product above. Let me compute $ (1 + x + \\cdots + x^{17})(1 + x + \\cdots + x^{16}) $. Wait, no. Wait, the first factor is $ x^{18} + x^{17} + \\cdots + 1 $. Wait, $ x^{18} + x^{17} + ... + 1 $ is the same as $ 1 + x + ... + x^{18} $. Similarly, $ x^{16} + ... + 1 = 1 + x + ... + x^{16} $. So the product is $ (1 + x + ... + x^{18})(1 + x + ... + x^{16}) $. \n\nBut how does that relate to the original expression? The original was $ (1 + x + ... + x^{17})^2 - x^{17} $. Let me check if they are equal. Let me compute $ (S)^2 - x^{17} $, where $ S = 1 + x + ... + x^{17} $. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here? Let me check with specific values. Let me take x=0. Then P(0) should be (1)^2 - 0 = 1. On the other hand, the product expression would be (1 + 0 + ... + 0^{18})(1 + 0 + ... + 0^{16}) = (1)(1) = 1. So that's consistent. How about x=1? Original expression: (1 + 1 + ... + 1)^2 - 1. There are 18 terms in the sum (from 0 to 17), so 18^2 - 1 = 324 - 1 = 323. The product expression would be (sum from 0 to 18 of 1) times (sum from 0 to 16 of 1) = 19 * 17 = 323. So that's also consistent. So that seems correct. Therefore, the polynomial $ P(x) $ simplifies to $ (1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^{18})(1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^{16}) $. \n\nBut maybe we can write these sums as geometric series again. Let me recall that $ 1 + x + \\cdots + x^n = \\frac{x^{n+1} - 1}{x - 1} $. Therefore, the first factor is $ \\frac{x^{19} - 1}{x - 1} $, and the second factor is $ \\frac{x^{17} - 1}{x - 1} $. Therefore, the product is $ \\frac{(x^{19} - 1)(x^{17} - 1)}{(x - 1)^2} $, which is what we had earlier. So that's consistent. \n\nBut since we have factored the numerator as $ (x^{19} - 1)(x^{17} - 1) $, and divided by $ (x - 1)^2 $, then the roots of $ P(x) $ are the roots of $ x^{19} - 1 = 0 $ and $ x^{17} - 1 = 0 $, except for the roots at $ x = 1 $, which are canceled by the denominator. \n\nTherefore, the roots of $ P(x) $ are the 19th roots of unity except $ x = 1 $, and the 17th roots of unity except $ x = 1 $. Therefore, total number of roots is (19 - 1) + (17 - 1) = 18 + 16 = 34, which matches the problem statement. \n\nTherefore, the roots of $ P(x) $ are all the roots of unity of order 17 and 19, except for the root at 1. \n\nTherefore, each root is a primitive 17th root of unity or a 17th root of unity (but not 1), and similarly for 19th roots. \n\nBut since 17 and 19 are both prime numbers, the roots of $ x^{17} - 1 = 0 $ are $ e^{2\\pi i k/17} $ for $ k = 0, 1, ..., 16 $, and similarly for 19th roots. Excluding $ k = 0 $ (which corresponds to 1), we have roots $ e^{2\\pi i k/17} $ for $ k = 1, ..., 16 $, and $ e^{2\\pi i m/19} $ for $ m = 1, ..., 18 $. \n\nTherefore, all the roots of P(x) are on the unit circle, so each $ r_k = 1 $. Therefore, each root is of the form $ \\cos(2\\pi a_k) + i \\sin(2\\pi a_k) $, so $ a_k $ is the fractional part of the angle divided by $ 2\\pi $. \n\nTherefore, the $ a_k $ values correspond to $ k/17 $ for $ k = 1, ..., 16 $ and $ m/19 $ for $ m = 1, ..., 18 $. However, note that these fractions may not be unique when reduced, but since 17 and 19 are coprime, the fractions $ k/17 $ and $ m/19 $ will all be distinct when considered modulo 1. Wait, but actually, since 17 and 19 are coprime, the fractions $ k/17 $ and $ m/19 $ will not overlap except at 0, which is excluded. Therefore, all the $ a_k $ values are distinct fractions between 0 and 1. \n\nBut the problem says that the roots are ordered as $ 0 < a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq ... \\leq a_{34} < 1 $. So we need to sort all the fractions $ \\frac{1}{17}, \\frac{2}{17}, ..., \\frac{16}{17} $ and $ \\frac{1}{19}, \\frac{2}{19}, ..., \\frac{18}{19} $ in increasing order, then take the first five $ a_k $ and sum them up. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the five smallest fractions among those two sets. \n\nSo, to solve this, I need to list the fractions $ \\frac{1}{17}, \\frac{2}{17}, ..., \\frac{16}{17} $ and $ \\frac{1}{19}, \\frac{2}{19}, ..., \\frac{18}{19} $, sort them, and find the first five. Then sum those five fractions. \n\nBut how do I find the smallest ones? Let me note that the smallest fractions will be the smallest fractions from both sets. Since 1/19 is smaller than 1/17 (since 19 > 17), then 1/19 is the smallest. Then the next one would be 1/17 vs 2/19. Let me compute 1/17 ≈ 0.0588 and 2/19 ≈ 0.1053. So 1/17 is smaller. Then the next one would be 2/19 ≈ 0.1053 vs 2/17 ≈ 0.1176. So 2/19 is next. Then 2/17 vs 3/19 ≈ 0.1579. 2/17 ≈ 0.1176 is smaller. Then 3/19 vs 3/17 ≈ 0.1765. 3/19 ≈ 0.1579 is smaller. So the order so far is:\n\n1/19, 1/17, 2/19, 2/17, 3/19,...\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFirst five terms:\n\n1. 1/19 ≈ 0.0526\n2. 1/17 ≈ 0.0588\n3. 2/19 ≈ 0.1053\n4. 2/17 ≈ 0.1176\n5. 3/19 ≈ 0.1579\n\nTherefore, the first five a_k are 1/19, 1/17, 2/19, 2/17, 3/19. Therefore, their sum is:\n\n1/19 + 1/17 + 2/19 + 2/17 + 3/19.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nGroup the terms with denominator 19: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6/19.\n\nGroup the terms with denominator 17: 1 + 2 = 3, so 3/17.\n\nTotal sum: 6/19 + 3/17. To add these, find a common denominator. 17*19 = 323.\n\nConvert 6/19 to (6*17)/323 = 102/323.\n\nConvert 3/17 to (3*19)/323 = 57/323.\n\nTotal sum: 102 + 57 = 159/323. \n\nBut wait, need to check if 159 and 323 are coprime. Let me check. \n\nFirst, factor 323: 17*19 = 323. \n\nCheck if 159 is divisible by 17 or 19. \n\nDivide 159 by 17: 17*9 = 153, 159 - 153 = 6, so no. \n\nDivide 159 by 19: 19*8 = 152, 159 - 152 = 7, so no. \n\nTherefore, 159 and 323 share no common factors. Wait, but 159 factors into 3*53. Let me check 323 divided by 3: 3*107 = 321, so 323 - 321 = 2, so no. Therefore, yes, 159/323 is reduced. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Given that a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = m/n,\" so m is 159 and n is 323? Then m + n is 159 + 323 = 482. \n\nBut before I conclude, I need to make sure that my ordering of the first five terms is correct. Let me check each step again.\n\nFirst, list the fractions:\n\nFrom 1/19 to 18/19 and from 1/17 to 16/17.\n\nFirst, the smallest is 1/19 ≈ 0.0526.\n\nNext is 1/17 ≈ 0.0588.\n\nThen next, compare 2/19 ≈ 0.1053 and 2/17 ≈ 0.1176. So 2/19 is next.\n\nThen next compare 2/17 ≈ 0.1176 and 3/19 ≈ 0.1579. So 2/17 is next.\n\nThen next compare 3/19 ≈ 0.1579 and 3/17 ≈ 0.1765. So 3/19 is next. \n\nTherefore, first five terms are 1/19, 1/17, 2/19, 2/17, 3/19. Sum is 1/19 + 1/17 + 2/19 + 2/17 + 3/19 = (1 + 2 + 3)/19 + (1 + 2)/17 = 6/19 + 3/17 = 159/323. \n\nBut let me check if there isn't another fraction that is smaller than 3/19. For example, after 2/17, the next candidates are 3/19, 3/17, and also 4/19? Wait, no. After 2/17 ≈ 0.1176, the next possible fractions are:\n\nFrom the 1/19 sequence: next is 3/19 ≈ 0.1579.\n\nFrom the 1/17 sequence: next is 3/17 ≈ 0.1765.\n\nSo yes, 3/19 is smaller than 3/17. Therefore, fifth term is 3/19. \n\nBut let me check if there are other fractions between 2/17 and 3/19. For example, maybe 1/ something? But all the fractions are either multiples of 1/17 or 1/19. Since we already took the first two from 1/19 and 1/17, then the next ones are 2/19 and 2/17. Then the next ones are 3/19 and 3/17, etc. Therefore, yes, the order is as above. \n\nBut let me verify with decimal approx:\n\n1/19 ≈ 0.0526\n\n1/17 ≈ 0.0588\n\n2/19 ≈ 0.1053\n\n2/17 ≈ 0.1176\n\n3/19 ≈ 0.1579\n\nThen comes 3/17 ≈ 0.1765, then 4/19 ≈ 0.2105, 4/17 ≈ 0.2353, etc. \n\nYes, so the first five are indeed as above. Therefore, their sum is 159/323. \n\nBut let me check 159 and 323 for GCD. As I did before, 323 is 17*19. 159 factors into 3*53. 53 is a prime number. 17 and 19 don't divide into 159. Therefore, yes, 159/323 is reduced. Therefore, m = 159, n = 323. Then m + n = 159 + 323 = 482. \n\nBut wait, let me check if 159 and 323 have any common factors. Let me compute GCD(159, 323). \n\nCompute GCD(323, 159). \n\n323 divided by 159 is 2 with a remainder of 323 - 2*159 = 323 - 318 = 5. \n\nSo GCD(159, 5). \n\n159 divided by 5 is 31 with remainder 4. \n\nGCD(5, 4). \n\n5 divided by 4 is 1 with remainder 1. \n\nGCD(4, 1). \n\nWhich is 1. Therefore, yes, GCD is 1. Therefore, 159/323 is reduced. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 159 + 323 = 482. \n\nBut wait, before I get too confident, let me check again the problem statement. The problem says \"the polynomial P(x) = ... has 34 complex roots...\". Since we have 16 roots from 17th roots (excluding 1) and 18 roots from 19th roots (excluding 1), total 34. Each of these roots is on the unit circle, so r_k = 1. Therefore, the a_k's correspond to the angles divided by 2π. \n\nBut let me check if there are any multiple roots? The roots of P(x) are the 17th and 19th roots of unity except 1. Since 17 and 19 are distinct primes, there are no common roots between them except 1, which is excluded. Therefore, all roots are distinct, so each a_k is unique. Therefore, the ordering is as discussed. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 482. However, let me check if I made any mistake in the calculation of the sum. \n\nCompute 6/19 + 3/17:\n\nConvert to decimal to check:\n\n6/19 ≈ 0.3158\n\n3/17 ≈ 0.1765\n\nSum ≈ 0.4923. \n\nNow compute 159/323 ≈ 0.49226... which matches. \n\nAlternatively, compute 1/19 + 1/17 + 2/19 + 2/17 + 3/19:\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(1 + 2 + 3)/19 + (1 + 2)/17 = 6/19 + 3/17. Correct. \n\nTherefore, seems correct. \n\nBut let me check if there is a possibility that another fraction could be smaller. For example, suppose there is a fraction from the 1/17 or 1/19 sequences that I missed. For example, after 1/19 and 1/17, could there be a 1/(something else)? But no, because the fractions are only from 1/17 and 1/19. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a fraction like 1/ something else? But no, because P(x) only has roots which are 17th and 19th roots of unity except 1. Therefore, their angles correspond to k/17 and m/19. Therefore, the a_k's are exactly those fractions. \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct, and the answer is 482. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Maybe using Farey sequences or something else? \n\nAlternatively, list all fractions up to the fifth term. Let me try:\n\nList all fractions from both sets:\n\nFrom 1/17 ≈ 0.0588, 2/17 ≈ 0.1176, 3/17 ≈ 0.1765, 4/17 ≈ 0.2353, 5/17 ≈ 0.2941, 6/17 ≈ 0.3529, 7/17 ≈ 0.4118, 8/17 ≈ 0.4706, 9/17 ≈ 0.5294, 10/17 ≈ 0.5882, 11/17 ≈ 0.6471, 12/17 ≈ 0.7059, 13/17 ≈ 0.7647, 14/17 ≈ 0.8235, 15/17 ≈ 0.8824, 16/17 ≈ 0.9412.\n\nFrom 1/19 ≈ 0.0526, 2/19 ≈ 0.1053, 3/19 ≈ 0.1579, 4/19 ≈ 0.2105, 5/19 ≈ 0.2632, 6/19 ≈ 0.3158, 7/19 ≈ 0.3684, 8/19 ≈ 0.4211, 9/19 ≈ 0.4737, 10/19 ≈ 0.5263, 11/19 ≈ 0.5789, 12/19 ≈ 0.6316, 13/19 ≈ 0.6842, 14/19 ≈ 0.7368, 15/19 ≈ 0.7895, 16/19 ≈ 0.8421, 17/19 ≈ 0.8947, 18/19 ≈ 0.9474.\n\nNow merge these two lists in order:\n\nStart with the smallest:\n\n1/19 ≈ 0.0526,\n\nthen 1/17 ≈ 0.0588,\n\nthen 2/19 ≈ 0.1053,\n\nthen 2/17 ≈ 0.1176,\n\nthen 3/19 ≈ 0.1579,\n\nthen 3/17 ≈ 0.1765,\n\nthen 4/19 ≈ 0.2105,\n\nthen 4/17 ≈ 0.2353,\n\nthen 5/19 ≈ 0.2632,\n\nthen 5/17 ≈ 0.2941,\n\nthen 6/19 ≈ 0.3158,\n\nthen 6/17 ≈ 0.3529,\n\nthen 7/19 ≈ 0.3684,\n\nthen 7/17 ≈ 0.4118,\n\nthen 8/19 ≈ 0.4211,\n\nthen 8/17 ≈ 0.4706,\n\nthen 9/19 ≈ 0.4737,\n\nthen 9/17 ≈ 0.5294,\n\nthen 10/19 ≈ 0.5263? Wait, no, 10/19 ≈ 0.5263? Wait, 10/19 is approximately 0.5263. Wait, but 9/17 ≈ 0.5294 is larger than 10/19. Therefore, after 9/19 ≈ 0.4737 comes 10/19 ≈ 0.5263, but before that, maybe 8/17 ≈ 0.4706, then 9/19 ≈ 0.4737, then 10/19 ≈ 0.5263, but also 9/17 ≈ 0.5294. So between 9/19 and 10/19, there is 9/17? Wait, no, 9/19 ≈ 0.4737, then next is 10/19 ≈ 0.5263. But 8/17 ≈ 0.4706 is less than 9/19 ≈ 0.4737. Wait, maybe my ordering is wrong here. Let me redo the merged list step by step.\n\nLet me list all fractions in order:\n\nFirst list:\n\nFrom 1/19 ≈ 0.0526,\n\nthen 1/17 ≈ 0.0588,\n\nthen 2/19 ≈ 0.1053,\n\nthen 2/17 ≈ 0.1176,\n\nthen 3/19 ≈ 0.1579,\n\nthen 3/17 ≈ 0.1765,\n\nthen 4/19 ≈ 0.2105,\n\nthen 4/17 ≈ 0.2353,\n\nthen 5/19 ≈ 0.2632,\n\nthen 5/17 ≈ 0.2941,\n\nthen 6/19 ≈ 0.3158,\n\nthen 6/17 ≈ 0.3529,\n\nthen 7/19 ≈ 0.3684,\n\nthen 7/17 ≈ 0.4118,\n\nthen 8/19 ≈ 0.4211,\n\nthen 8/17 ≈ 0.4706,\n\nthen 9/19 ≈ 0.4737,\n\nthen 9/17 ≈ 0.5294,\n\nthen 10/19 ≈ 0.5263,\n\nWait, here there's a problem. After 8/17 ≈ 0.4706 comes 9/19 ≈ 0.4737, then next is 10/19 ≈ 0.5263? But 9/17 ≈ 0.5294 is between 10/19 and something else? Wait, 10/19 ≈ 0.5263 is less than 9/17 ≈ 0.5294, so after 9/19 comes 10/19, then 9/17, then 10/17 ≈ 0.5882, then 11/19 ≈ 0.5789? Wait, no:\n\nWait, after 9/19 ≈ 0.4737 comes 10/19 ≈ 0.5263, then comes 9/17 ≈ 0.5294, then 11/19 ≈ 0.5789, then 10/17 ≈ 0.5882, then 12/19 ≈ 0.6316, then 11/17 ≈ 0.6471, etc. \n\nBut regardless, the first five terms are definitely up to 3/19. \n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there's any other fractions between, say, 2/17 and 3/19. For example, is there a fraction from the other set between them? \n\n2/17 ≈ 0.1176 and 3/19 ≈ 0.1579. \n\nIs there any fraction k/17 or m/19 between those two? \n\nLooking at the 1/17 fractions: next after 2/17 is 3/17 ≈ 0.1765, which is larger than 3/19 ≈ 0.1579. \n\nLooking at the 1/19 fractions: next after 2/19 is 3/19 ≈ 0.1579. \n\nTherefore, between 2/17 and 3/19, there are no other fractions. Therefore, the order is as I thought. \n\nTherefore, the first five a_k's are indeed 1/19, 1/17, 2/19, 2/17, 3/19. \n\nTherefore, the sum is 6/19 + 3/17 = 159/323, which reduces to 159/323, so m + n is 159 + 323 = 482. \n\nBut let me check once more if 159 and 323 are co-prime. \n\nAs before, GCD(159, 323):\n\nDivisors of 159: 1, 3, 53, 159.\n\nCheck if 3 divides 323: 3*107 = 321, 323 - 321 = 2, so no.\n\nCheck if 53 divides 323: 53*6 = 318, 323 - 318 = 5, so no. Therefore, yes, co-prime. \n\nTherefore, answer is 482. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check with another method. Maybe cross-multiplying to compare fractions?\n\nFor example, when I thought that 1/17 comes after 1/19, that's because 1/17 ≈ 0.0588 > 1/19 ≈ 0.0526. Correct.\n\nThen 2/19 ≈ 0.1053 vs 2/17 ≈ 0.1176. Since 2/19 < 2/17, so next is 2/19. Then next is 2/17. Then 3/19 ≈ 0.1579 vs 3/17 ≈ 0.1765. So next is 3/19. \n\nTherefore, the order is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{482}\n</think>"}
