Let's analyze each option to determine which one is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Option A: *Thermistors can be used in temperature measurement and control devices*  \n- **Correct**. Thermistors are resistors whose resistance changes significantly with temperature. They are widely used in temperature sensors and control systems, such as in thermostats and digital thermometers.\n\n---\n\n### Option B: *Photoconductive resistors are a type of photoelectric sensor*  \n- **Correct**. Photoconductive resistors (also known as photoresistors or light-dependent resistors) change their resistance in response to light. They are indeed a form of photoelectric sensor used in light-sensitive devices like automatic streetlights and cameras.\n\n---\n\n### Option C: *Resistance wires can be used in electric heating equipment*  \n- **Correct**. Resistance wires (e.g., nichrome) are used in electric heaters because they generate heat when an electric current passes through them. This is a fundamental application of electrical resistance.\n\n---\n\n### Option D: *Resistance mainly plays the role of passing direct current and blocking alternating current in circuits*  \n- **Incorrect**. This is the **incorrect** statement. Resistors do not inherently \"pass DC and block AC.\" In fact, resistors resist both AC and DC equally; they do not differentiate between the two. The components that are used to pass or block AC/DC are **capacitors** (which block DC and pass AC) and **inductors** (which block AC and pass DC). Therefore, the claim in Option D is a **mischaracterization** of a resistor's role.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the question is about which statement regarding resistance applications is incorrect. The options are A through D. The context given is the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics related to the giant magnetoresistance effect, but the question is about other resistance applications.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Thermistors can be used in temperature measurement and control devices. Thermistors are temperature-sensitive resistors. Their resistance changes with temperature, so they are indeed used in temperature sensors and control systems. That seems correct. So A is likely a correct statement.\n\nOption B: Photoconductive resistors are a type of photoelectric sensor. Photoconductive resistors, or photoresistors, change their resistance based on the light intensity. They are used as light sensors, which are a type of photoelectric sensor. So B sounds correct. So B is a correct statement.\n\nOption C: Resistance wires can be used in electric heating equipment. Resistance wires, like nichrome, are commonly used in heaters because when current passes through them, they generate heat due to their resistance. So C is correct. \n\nOption D: Resistance mainly plays the role of passing direct current and blocking alternating current in circuits. Hmm, wait. Resistors don't block AC or DC. They resist the flow of current regardless of whether it's AC or DC. However, capacitors are used to block DC and pass AC, and inductors do the opposite. So if a resistor is in a circuit, it will resist both AC and DC. The statement in D says resistors pass DC and block AC, which is incorrect. That's probably the incorrect statement. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to think again. Resistors don't block AC; they just provide a resistance that affects both AC and DC. The main components that block or pass based on AC/DC are capacitors and inductors. So D is incorrect. Therefore, the incorrect statement is D.\n</think>"}
