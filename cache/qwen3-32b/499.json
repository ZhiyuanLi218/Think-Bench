The question is about how long it would take 6 billion people to count all the molecules in 1 gram of water if each person counts 5000 molecules per hour. The options are from 10 years up to 10 million years. Hmm, this seems like a problem involving Avogadro's number and some basic calculations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many molecules are in 1 gram of water. To do that, I remember that the molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18 grams per mole. So, 1 gram of water is 1/18 moles. Then, using Avogadro's number, which is given here as 6 × 10²³ molecules per mole, I can calculate the total number of molecules.\n\nSo, the number of moles in 1 gram of water is 1 / 18 ≈ 0.0556 moles. Multiplying that by Avogadro's number gives the total number of molecules. Let me write that out:\n\nNumber of molecules = (1 g / 18 g/mol) × 6 × 10²³ molecules/mol.\n\nCalculating that: 1 divided by 18 is approximately 0.0556, so 0.0556 × 6 × 10²³. Let me compute that. 0.0556 × 6 is about 0.3336. So, the total number of molecules is approximately 0.3336 × 10²³, which is 3.336 × 10²² molecules. Let me check if I did that right. Yes, 1/18 is roughly 0.0555..., times 6 is 0.333..., so 3.33 × 10²² molecules. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, the next part is figuring out how long it would take 6 billion people to count all these molecules if each person can count 5000 molecules per hour. So, first, let's find out the total number of molecules counted per hour by all people combined.\n\nEach person counts 5000 molecules/hour. With 6 billion people, that would be 6 × 10⁹ people × 5 × 10³ molecules/hour. Multiplying those together: 6 × 5 = 30, and 10⁹ × 10³ = 10¹². So total molecules per hour is 3 × 10¹³ molecules/hour. Wait, 6 × 5 is 30, so 3 × 10¹ × 10¹²? Wait, 6 × 5 is 30, which is 3 × 10¹, so total is 3 × 10¹ × 10¹² = 3 × 10¹³ molecules per hour. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of molecules to count is 3.336 × 10²². So, the time required in hours would be total molecules divided by molecules per hour:\n\nTime (hours) = (3.336 × 10²²) / (3 × 10¹³) = (3.336 / 3) × 10^(22-13) = 1.112 × 10⁹ hours. So approximately 1.112 × 10⁹ hours. Let me confirm that division. 3.336 divided by 3 is indeed about 1.112. And 10²² divided by 10¹³ is 10⁹. So that's right.\n\nNow, converting hours into years. First, let's convert hours to days, then days to years. Assuming an average of 24 hours in a day and 365 days in a year.\n\nFirst, hours to days: 1.112 × 10⁹ hours ÷ 24 hours/day. Let's calculate that. 1.112 × 10⁹ / 24 ≈ 4.633 × 10⁷ days. Because 10⁹ divided by 24 is roughly 4.166 × 10⁷, and multiplying by 1.112 gives approximately 4.63 × 10⁷ days.\n\nThen, converting days to years: 4.633 × 10⁷ days ÷ 365 days/year. Let me compute that. 4.633 × 10⁷ / 3.65 × 10² ≈ (4.633 / 3.65) × 10^(7-2) ≈ 1.27 × 10⁵ years. Let me check that division. 4.633 divided by 3.65 is approximately 1.27 (since 3.65 × 1.27 ≈ 4.6355). So yes, approximately 1.27 × 10⁵ years, which is 127,000 years.\n\nLooking at the options: (A)10 years (B)1 thousand years (C)100 thousand years (D)10 million years. Our calculation is approximately 127,000 years, which is closest to option (C) 100 thousand years. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes approximations can lead to errors.\n\nLet me redo the time in hours:\n\nTotal molecules: approx 3.33 × 10²².\n\nTotal per hour: 6e9 * 5e3 = 3e13 per hour.\n\nTime in hours: 3.33e22 / 3e13 = 1.11e9 hours. Correct.\n\nConvert to years:\n\n1.11e9 hours / 24 / 365.\n\nFirst, hours to days: 1.11e9 / 24 ≈ 4.625e7 days.\n\nDays to years: 4.625e7 / 365 ≈ let's compute 4.625e7 / 3.65e5 (since 365 days is 3.65e5 hours? Wait no, sorry, 365 days is 365 days. Wait, 4.625 × 10^7 days divided by 365 days/year.\n\nSo 4.625 × 10^7 / 3.65 × 10^2 = (4.625 / 3.65) × 10^(7-2) = approx 1.267 × 10^5 years, which is 126,700 years. So approximately 127,000 years. So that's about 1.27 × 10^5 years. The options are 100 thousand (which is 1 × 10^5) or 10 million (1 × 10^7). 127,000 is closer to 100,000 than to 10 million. So option (C) is 100 thousand years. But let me check if maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of molecules.\n\nWait, let me check the initial calculation again. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol. So 1 gram is 1/18 mol. Avogadro's number is 6 × 10^23. So molecules in 1 gram is (6 × 10^23) / 18 = 3.33 × 10^22. Correct. So that part is right.\n\nTotal molecules: 3.33 × 10^22.\n\nTotal counting rate: 6 × 10^9 people × 5 × 10^3 molecules/hour = 3 × 10^13 molecules/hour. Correct.\n\nTotal time in hours: 3.33 × 10^22 / 3 × 10^13 ≈ 1.11 × 10^9 hours. Correct.\n\nConvert to years:\n\n1.11 × 10^9 hours / (24 × 365) hours per year. Let me compute 24 × 365 first. 24 × 365 = 8,760 hours per year.\n\nSo total time in years is 1.11 × 10^9 / 8.76 × 10^3 ≈ (1.11 / 8.76) × 10^(9 - 3) ≈ 0.1267 × 10^6 ≈ 1.267 × 10^5 years. So 126,700 years. Yes, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the closest option is (C) 100 thousand years. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\n(A)10 years\n\n(B)1 thousand years\n\n(C)100 thousand years\n\n(D)10 million years\n\nSo 127,000 is indeed closest to 100,000 (option C) rather than 1,000 (B) or 10 million (D). So the answer should be (C). But let me check if there's a possible miscalculation or if perhaps the question expects a different approach?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in Avogadro's number? The problem states to take Avogadro's constant as 6 × 10^23 mol⁻¹. So that's correct. And molar mass of water is 18 g/mol. So 1 gram is 1/18 mol. So 6e23 / 18 is 3.33e22. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using 1 gram of water as 1 mole? No, because water is 18 g/mol. So 1 gram is 1/18 mole. So that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about 1 gram-molecule? No, the question says 1 gram of water.\n\nAnother check: Let me compute the exact numbers without rounding.\n\nNumber of moles in 1 gram of water: 1 / 18 = 0.055555... moles.\n\nMultiply by Avogadro's number: 0.055555... × 6 × 10^23 = (1/18) × 6 × 10^23 = (6 / 18) × 10^23 = (1/3) × 10^23 = 3.333... × 10^22 molecules. So exactly 1/3 × 10^23, which is 3.333... × 10^22. So that is precise.\n\nTotal molecules: 3.333... × 10^22.\n\nTotal molecules per hour by all people: 6e9 * 5e3 = 3e13 molecules/hour.\n\nTime in hours: 3.333...e22 / 3e13 = 1.111...e9 hours. So exactly 1.111... × 10^9 hours.\n\nConvert to years:\n\nNumber of seconds in a year? Wait, maybe another way. But we did hours per year as 8760. Let me confirm that 24*365 is 8760. 24*300=7200, 24*65=1560, total 7200+1560=8760. Correct.\n\nSo 1.111... × 10^9 hours divided by 8760 hours per year equals:\n\nLet me compute 1.111 × 10^9 / 8.76 × 10^3 = (1.111 / 8.76) × 10^(9-3) = approx (0.1268) × 10^6 = 1.268 × 10^5 years, which is 126,800 years. So again, same result.\n\nSo the answer is closest to 100,000 years, which is option (C). Therefore, the correct answer should be (C).\n\nBut wait, let me check if the options are maybe different in the original problem? The user wrote:\n\nOptions: (A)10 years (B)1 thousand years (C)100 thousand years (D)10 million years\n\nYes, so (C) is 100 thousand years. So the answer is (C). However, sometimes in these problems, approximations can lead to different results. Let me check if perhaps I miscalculated the exponents.\n\nWait, let's go through the exponents again.\n\nTotal molecules: ~3.3 × 10²²\n\nTotal people: 6 × 10⁹\n\nRate per person: 5 × 10³ molecules/hour\n\nTotal rate: 6e9 * 5e3 = 3e13 molecules/hour. Correct.\n\nTime in hours: 3.3e22 / 3e13 = 1.1e9 hours. Correct.\n\nConvert to years:\n\n1.1e9 hours / 8.76e3 hours/year ≈ 1.1 / 8.76 × 1e6 ≈ 0.1256 × 1e6 = 1.256e5 ≈ 125,600 years. Yep, same.\n\nSo 125,600 is approximately 126,000, which is about 1.26 × 10⁵. The options are 1 × 10⁵ (C) and 1 × 10⁶ (D is 10 million which is 1 × 10⁷). So between 100,000 and 10 million, 126,000 is much closer to 100,000. So answer is (C). Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another possible error. For example, maybe the question says \"count the number of molecules in 1 gram of water\"—is there a possibility that I misread the question? No, I think the calculation is correct. The number of molecules in 1 gram of water is indeed around 3.3 × 10²². The counting rate is 3 × 10¹³ per hour. Time is 1.1 × 10⁹ hours. Converting to years gives ~1.26 × 10⁵, which is ~126,000 years. So option C is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects using 1 year = 1e4 hours for easier calculation? Let me check. If someone approximates 1 year as 10,000 hours, then 1.1e9 / 1e4 = 1.1e5 years, which is 110,000 years, still closest to 100,000. So even with that approximation, it's still option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using 1 year = 8,760 hours but rounding differently. Let me compute 1.11e9 divided by 8.76e3 more precisely.\n\nLet me compute 1.11e9 / 8.76e3:\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 1e3: 1.11e6 / 8.76 ≈ ?\n\nCompute 1.11e6 / 8.76:\n\nWell, 1.11e6 / 8.76 ≈ (1.11 / 8.76) × 1e6 ≈ 0.1267 × 1e6 = 126,700 years. So same as before.\n\nYes, so 126,700 is 1.267 × 10^5, so 126,700. So the closest order of magnitude is 1 × 10^5, which is 100,000. Therefore, option (C).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 100 thousand years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
