Let me start by visualizing the problem. There's a fixed sphere with radius a, and another smaller sphere with radius b sitting on top of it. The smaller sphere starts at rest at θ = 0, which I assume is the topmost point. Then, due to a small perturbation, it starts rolling down the fixed sphere. The problem mentions pure rolling, so there's no slipping. The coefficients of friction are given as static friction μ_s > 0 and kinetic friction μ_d = 0. Since it's pure rolling, we only need to consider static friction, which doesn't do work, so energy might be conserved here? Not sure yet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the forces acting on the rolling sphere. There's gravity pulling it downward, the normal force from the fixed sphere, and static friction which is responsible for the rolling without slipping. Since the sphere is rolling down the fixed sphere, the direction of static friction should be tangential to the surface, opposing the relative motion. Wait, but since it's rolling without slipping, the direction of static friction is actually what provides the torque necessary for rotation. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the coordinate system here.\n\nLet me set up coordinates. Let’s consider θ as the angle between the line connecting the centers of the two spheres and the vertical. So when θ = 0, the small sphere is at the top. As it rolls down, θ increases. The center of the small sphere is at a distance of (a + b) from the center of the fixed sphere. So, the position of the center of the small sphere can be described in polar coordinates with radius (a + b) and angle θ.\n\nNow, let me consider the forces. The gravitational force acts downward, which I can resolve into components along the tangent and normal to the surface of the fixed sphere. Similarly, the normal force N is acting radially outward from the center of the fixed sphere. The static friction force f_s acts tangentially, opposing the impending motion. But since the sphere is rolling down, the direction of static friction should be up the tangent, providing the necessary torque for rotation.\n\nLet me draw a free-body diagram mentally. The gravitational force mg acts downward. The component of gravity along the tangent is mg sin θ, and the component normal to the surface is mg cos θ. The normal force N is opposite to the normal component of gravity. The static friction force f_s is along the tangent but opposite to the direction of the tangential component of gravity? Wait, if the sphere is rolling down, then the tangential component of gravity is trying to cause translational motion downward, but static friction is providing the torque for rotation. Wait, actually, for rolling without slipping, the direction of static friction is such that it opposes the relative motion between the surfaces. But since the sphere is accelerating downward, the point of contact is trying to move backward relative to the fixed sphere. So static friction would act in the direction that prevents that, meaning it would act up the slope. So yes, f_s is up the tangent.\n\nSo, for the tangential direction, Newton's second law gives:\n\nm * a_t = mg sin θ - f_s\n\nWhere a_t is the tangential acceleration of the center of mass of the rolling sphere. Similarly, for the rotational motion, the torque due to static friction is τ = f_s * b (since the torque is force times the radius of the sphere). The angular acceleration α is related to the tangential acceleration a_t by α = a_t / b, because for rolling without slipping, the distance the center moves is related to the rotation angle. Wait, but the sphere is rolling on another sphere. Wait, is the rolling without slipping condition here similar to a sphere rolling on a flat surface? Or is it different because it's on a curved surface?\n\nThis is a key point. For pure rolling without slipping between two surfaces, the instantaneous point of contact is instantaneously at rest relative to each other. So, the distance traveled along the fixed sphere's surface by the center of the rolling sphere should correspond to an rotation of the rolling sphere such that the arc length rolled over by the sphere is equal to the arc length moved along the fixed sphere.\n\nWait, the fixed sphere has radius a, and the rolling sphere has radius b. When the center of the rolling sphere moves through an angle θ along the fixed sphere, the arc length along the fixed sphere's surface is s = (a + b)θ? Wait, no. Wait, the center of the rolling sphere moves along a circle of radius (a + b). But the point of contact between the two spheres moves along an arc on the fixed sphere. Wait, maybe I need to think about the rotation of the rolling sphere. If the rolling sphere rolls without slipping, then the arc length that it rolls over on its own surface must equal the arc length that it moves along the fixed sphere's surface. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote that when the center of the rolling sphere moves through an angle θ on the fixed sphere, the point of contact on the fixed sphere has moved along an arc of length s_fixed = a * θ. But the rolling sphere must have rotated such that the distance it has rolled over is equal to its own rotation. However, the center of the rolling sphere has moved along a circle of radius (a + b), so the arc length along the path of the center is s_center = (a + b) * θ. However, the rotation of the sphere relates to the arc length that it has rolled over. If there is no slipping between the two spheres, then the arc length that the rolling sphere has rotated over must equal the arc length along the fixed sphere's surface. Wait, that might be the case.\n\nSo, if the rolling sphere rolls without slipping on the fixed sphere, then the distance that the rolling sphere's surface moves relative to the fixed sphere's surface must be zero. Therefore, the arc length that the rolling sphere rotates through times its radius b must equal the arc length along the fixed sphere's surface times its radius a? Wait, no. Wait, when the center of the rolling sphere moves through an angle θ, the contact point moves along the fixed sphere's surface by an arc length of aθ. At the same time, the rolling sphere must have rotated through an angle φ such that the arc length it has rolled over is bφ. For no slipping, these two arc lengths must be equal, so aθ = bφ. Therefore, φ = (a/b)θ. Therefore, the angular velocity of the rolling sphere is ω = dφ/dt = (a/b) dθ/dt. Similarly, angular acceleration α = (a/b) d²θ/dt².\n\nBut wait, let me check. Suppose θ increases by a small amount dθ, then the center moves along an arc of radius (a + b). But the contact point on the fixed sphere moves along an arc of radius a, so the arc length is a dθ. For the rolling sphere, the rotation must correspond to that arc length. Therefore, the rolling sphere must have rotated by dφ such that b dφ = a dθ. Therefore, dφ = (a/b) dθ. Therefore, φ = (a/b)θ. Therefore, the angular velocity of the sphere is ω = dφ/dt = (a/b) dθ/dt. Similarly, angular acceleration α = (a/b) d²θ/dt². Therefore, this relates the rotation of the sphere to its translational motion.\n\nTherefore, for the rolling without slipping condition, the angular acceleration α is (a/b) times the angular acceleration θ''.\n\nNow, going back to the torque equation. The torque τ about the center of the rolling sphere is equal to the static friction force times the radius b of the sphere. So τ = f_s * b. Also, τ = I * α, where I is the moment of inertia of the sphere. For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia about its center is (2/5) m b². Therefore, f_s * b = I * α = (2/5) m b² * α. Substituting α = (a/b) θ'':\n\nf_s * b = (2/5) m b² * (a/b) θ'' => f_s * b = (2/5) m b a θ'' => f_s = (2/5) m a θ''.\n\nSo, we can express f_s in terms of θ''.\n\nNow, going back to the tangential equation of motion. The tangential acceleration a_t of the center of mass is related to θ''. Since the center of mass is moving along a circle of radius (a + b), the tangential acceleration is a_t = (a + b) θ''. Therefore, Newton's second law in the tangential direction is:\n\nm * a_t = m (a + b) θ'' = m g sin θ - f_s.\n\nSubstituting f_s from above:\n\nm (a + b) θ'' = m g sin θ - (2/5) m a θ''.\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n(a + b) θ'' = g sin θ - (2/5) a θ''.\n\nBring the term with θ'' on the right to the left:\n\n(a + b) θ'' + (2/5) a θ'' = g sin θ.\n\nFactor out θ'':\n\nθ'' [a + b + (2/5)a] = g sin θ.\n\nSimplify the terms in the bracket:\n\na + b + (2/5)a = (1 + 2/5)a + b = (7/5)a + b.\n\nTherefore:\n\nθ'' = [g sin θ] / [ (7/5)a + b ].\n\nBut wait, let me check the algebra again. Let me re-express:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n(a + b) θ'' + (2/5)a θ'' = g sin θ\n\nSo combining terms:\n\nθ'' [ (a + b) + (2/5)a ] = g sin θ\n\nWhich is θ'' [ a + b + (2/5)a ] = θ'' [ (1 + 2/5)a + b ] = θ'' [ (7/5)a + b ].\n\nTherefore:\n\nθ'' = g sin θ / [ (7/5)a + b ].\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\nθ'' = [ g sin θ ] / [ b + (7/5)a ].\n\nBut maybe we can write this in terms of combined denominators. Let me compute the denominator:\n\n(7/5)a + b = (7a + 5b)/5. Therefore:\n\nθ'' = [ g sin θ ] / [ (7a + 5b)/5 ] = 5g sin θ / (7a + 5b).\n\nSo the differential equation is:\n\nθ'' = [5g / (7a + 5b)] sin θ.\n\nBut wait, this seems like a simple pendulum equation, except inverted because the sphere is on top. However, in this case, θ is measured from the top, so sin θ would be positive as θ increases downward. But in terms of differential equations, this is similar to a pendulum equation but without the negative sign. However, for small angles, sin θ ≈ θ, so it would be θ'' proportional to θ, leading to instability, which makes sense because the sphere is at the top of the fixed sphere and a perturbation would cause it to roll down. However, the problem is asking for the differential equation in terms of θ'' and θ, so regardless of the specific form, the equation is θ'' = [5g / (7a + 5b)] sin θ.\n\nWait, but let me check my derivation again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the tangential acceleration. The center of mass is moving along a circle of radius (a + b), so tangential acceleration is (a + b) θ''. Correct.\n\nThen Newton's second law in tangential direction: m(a + b)θ'' = mg sin θ - f_s. Correct, because gravity component is mg sin θ downward the slope, and friction is upward the slope, opposing the motion? Wait, but if the sphere is accelerating downward, then the net force should be in the direction of acceleration. So if mg sin θ is greater than f_s, then the net force is mg sin θ - f_s, leading to acceleration. So that equation is correct.\n\nThen torque: τ = f_s * b = I * α. For solid sphere, I = (2/5) m b². Correct.\n\nAngular acceleration α: since rolling without slipping, the relation between the rotation of the sphere and the angle θ. Earlier, we found φ = (a/b) θ, so α = d²φ/dt² = (a/b) θ''. Therefore, substituting into torque equation:\n\nf_s * b = (2/5) m b² * (a/b) θ'' => f_s * b = (2/5) m a b θ'' => f_s = (2/5) m a θ''. Correct.\n\nSubstituting back into Newton's law:\n\n(a + b) θ'' = g sin θ - (2/5)a θ''.\n\nThen bringing terms together:\n\n(a + b)θ'' + (2/5)a θ'' = g sin θ => θ'' [a + b + (2/5)a] = g sin θ => θ'' [ (7/5)a + b ] = g sin θ => θ'' = [g / ( (7/5)a + b ) ] sin θ. Which is θ'' = [5g / (7a + 5b)] sin θ. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the differential equation is:\n\nd²θ/dt² = [5g / (7a + 5b)] sin θ.\n\nBut let me check if the rolling without slipping condition was applied correctly. Earlier, I said that the arc length moved along the fixed sphere's surface is aΔθ, and the rotation of the rolling sphere must have bΔφ = aΔθ, leading to Δφ = (a/b)Δθ. Therefore, φ = (a/b)θ. Therefore, angular velocity ω = dφ/dt = (a/b) dθ/dt. Angular acceleration α = (a/b) d²θ/dt². Therefore, torque equation is correct. Therefore, the derivation seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about the rolling without slipping is that the velocity of the center of mass v = (a + b) θ', and the angular velocity ω must satisfy v = ω b. Therefore, ω = v / b = (a + b)θ' / b. Wait, this is different from earlier. Wait, here I have a discrepancy. Which one is correct?\n\nHold on! This is critical. Earlier, I thought that the rotation of the sphere is related to the arc length along the fixed sphere, leading to φ = (a/b)θ. But here, if we think about the velocity of the center of mass, and the no-slip condition, then v = ω b. But is v equal to (a + b)θ' or something else?\n\nThis is a key point. Let me think carefully.\n\nThe center of mass of the rolling sphere is moving along a circular path of radius (a + b). Therefore, its speed is v = (a + b)θ'. However, if the sphere is rolling without slipping on the fixed sphere, then the point of contact between the two spheres must have zero relative velocity. The velocity of the point of contact on the fixed sphere is zero (since it's fixed). The velocity of the point of contact on the rolling sphere is the velocity of the center of mass minus the tangential velocity due to rotation. So, v_contact = v - ω b. For no slipping, v_contact = 0 => v = ω b. Therefore, ω = v / b = (a + b)θ' / b. Therefore, angular velocity ω = [(a + b)/b] θ'.\n\nBut earlier, I had ω = (a/b)θ'. So there is a discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nEarlier, I considered that the arc length moved along the fixed sphere's surface is aθ, and equated it to the rotation of the rolling sphere bφ, leading to φ = (a/b)θ. Therefore, ω = dφ/dt = (a/b)θ'. But according to the velocity argument, ω = [(a + b)/b] θ'. These two results are different. Which one is correct?\n\nThis is a critical error. Let me resolve this.\n\nImagine that as the sphere rolls down the fixed sphere, the center moves along a circle of radius (a + b). The distance traveled by the center along its path is s = (a + b)θ. However, the rotation of the sphere depends on how much it has rolled over the fixed sphere. The key is that the rotation of the sphere is such that the arc length it has rolled over on its own surface equals the arc length that it has moved along the fixed sphere's surface. Wait, but the fixed sphere's surface is being \"rolled over\" by the rolling sphere. However, the point of contact on the fixed sphere is moving along an arc of radius a, so the arc length is aθ. Therefore, if the rolling sphere rolls without slipping, then the rotation of the rolling sphere must satisfy that the arc length it has rolled over is equal to aθ. Therefore, bφ = aθ => φ = (a/b)θ. Therefore, ω = dφ/dt = (a/b)θ'.\n\nBut according to the velocity argument, we have v = (a + b)θ' = ω b => ω = [(a + b)/b]θ'. So which is correct?\n\nThis seems contradictory. Where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! The mistake is in assuming that the arc length rolled over by the sphere is equal to the arc length on the fixed sphere. But actually, when the sphere rolls on another sphere, the rotation is due to both the movement along its own path and the curvature of the fixed sphere. Let me think again.\n\nImagine two spheres in contact. When the rolling sphere moves along the fixed sphere, the rotation is caused by the fact that different points on the rolling sphere must stay in contact. The total rotation of the rolling sphere is due to both its orbital motion around the fixed sphere and its own spin. Wait, but in the case of a sphere rolling on another sphere, is there a combination of orbital and spin rotation?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the rotation of the rolling sphere as the sum of two components? Or maybe not. Let me think of an example. If the rolling sphere were rolling on a flat surface, then the distance moved by the center is equal to the arc length rolled over, so v = ω b. In that case, if you have a sphere rolling on a flat surface, yes. But here, the sphere is rolling on a curved surface. So, the distance that the sphere \"rolls over\" is not just the distance moved by the center, but also depends on the curvature of the surface it's rolling on.\n\nThis is similar to a sphere rolling on the inside of a sphere versus rolling on the outside. The direction of rotation would be different. In this case, the sphere is rolling on the outside of the fixed sphere. Let me recall that when a sphere rolls without slipping on another sphere, the relationship between the rotation of the sphere and the angular displacement θ is more complex.\n\nLet me try to derive it properly.\n\nConsider two points: the center of the fixed sphere O, the center of the rolling sphere C, and the point of contact P between the two spheres. The position vector from O to C is of length (a + b), and makes an angle θ with the vertical. The point P lies along the line connecting O and C, at a distance a from O and b from C.\n\nWhen the rolling sphere rotates by an angle φ, the point that was in contact with P moves along the surface of the rolling sphere. For pure rolling, the arc length that the rolling sphere rotates over must equal the arc length that the point P moves along the fixed sphere.\n\nBut the movement of P along the fixed sphere is an arc length of aΔθ. The rotation of the rolling sphere corresponds to an arc length of bΔφ. Therefore, for no slipping, we have aΔθ = bΔφ => Δφ = (a/b)Δθ. Therefore, φ = (a/b)θ. Therefore, angular velocity ω = (a/b)θ'. However, according to the velocity argument, we had ω = [(a + b)/b]θ'. There is a contradiction here.\n\nWhat is the resolution?\n\nThe problem is that the velocity argument assumes that the rotation is only due to the movement of the center, but in reality, the rotation is also affected by the fact that the sphere is moving along a curved path. When an object moves along a curved path, even if it's not rotating, different points on the object have different velocities. However, in the case of rolling without slipping, the rotation must account for both the translational motion and the curvature of the path.\n\nLet me consider the velocity of the point of contact P on the rolling sphere. The velocity of P is the velocity of the center C plus the velocity due to rotation. The velocity of the center C is v = (a + b)θ' tangential to the circle of radius (a + b). The velocity due to rotation is ω × r, where r is the vector from C to P. Since P is a distance b from C, and the direction from C to P is radially outward, the velocity due to rotation is ω b in the direction tangential to the rolling sphere's surface. However, the direction of this tangential velocity depends on the direction of rotation.\n\nIf the sphere is rolling down the fixed sphere, then the rotation is clockwise (assuming θ increasing clockwise). Therefore, the velocity due to rotation at point P is downward tangent to the rolling sphere. But the velocity of the center is also tangent to the path of the center, which is different from tangent to the rolling sphere.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to draw it mentally. The center C is moving along a circle of radius (a + b). The point P is located at the bottom of the rolling sphere, in contact with the fixed sphere. The velocity of C is tangential to its circular path. The velocity of P is the velocity of C plus the velocity due to rotation. For no slipping, the velocity of P must be zero (since the fixed sphere is not moving). Therefore:\n\nv_P = v_C + v_rotation = 0.\n\nLet me compute v_rotation. The rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane of motion. The angular velocity vector ω is clockwise, so the direction of v_rotation at point P is tangential to the rolling sphere. However, since point P is at the bottom of the rolling sphere, the direction of v_rotation is opposite to the direction of v_C?\n\nWait, suppose the center is moving to the right (tangent to its circular path). If the sphere is rotating clockwise, then the bottom point P has a velocity to the left due to rotation. If the center is moving to the right, then for the total velocity of P to be zero, we need:\n\nv_C (to the right) + v_rotation (to the left) = 0 => v_C = v_rotation.\n\nTherefore, v_C = ω b.\n\nBut v_C is also equal to (a + b)θ'. Therefore:\n\n(a + b)θ' = ω b => ω = [(a + b)/b]θ'.\n\nBut earlier, from the arc length argument, we had ω = (a/b)θ'. So which is correct?\n\nThis is a contradiction. There must be a mistake in one of the reasonings. Let me think again.\n\nThe arc length argument says that the rotation angle φ is such that the arc length on the rolling sphere equals the arc length on the fixed sphere. So if the center moves through angle θ, then the arc length on the fixed sphere is aθ, and on the rolling sphere is bφ. Therefore, aθ = bφ => φ = (a/b)θ. Therefore, ω = dφ/dt = (a/b)θ'.\n\nBut according to the velocity argument, we have ω = [(a + b)/b]θ'.\n\nThese two results must be reconciled. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! The arc length argument assumes that the rotation of the sphere is only due to the rolling over the fixed sphere. However, when the sphere moves along a circular path, there is an additional rotation due to the orbital motion. Wait, this is similar to the difference between rolling without slipping on a flat surface versus rolling without slipping on a curved surface. In the case of a sphere rolling on the inside or outside of another sphere, there is a geometric factor that comes into play.\n\nLet me recall that when a circle rolls on another circle, the total rotation is the sum of the rotation due to the rolling and the rotation due to going around the fixed circle. However, in the case of rolling without slipping, these are related.\n\nWait, for example, if a circle of radius b rolls without slipping around the outside of a fixed circle of radius a, the total rotation angle of the rolling circle is given by the angle it rotates due to going around the fixed circle plus the rotation due to rolling. Wait, actually, when a circle rolls around another circle without slipping, the total rotation is (a + b)/b times the angle it goes around the fixed circle. This is known as the \"rolling without slipping\" condition for circular paths.\n\nFor example, if a coin of radius b rolls around another coin of radius a without slipping, the number of rotations the rolling coin makes is (a + b)/b. So if it goes around once (2π radians), it rotates (a + b)/b times. Therefore, the angular rotation φ of the rolling coin is φ = [(a + b)/b]θ, where θ is the angle it has gone around the fixed coin. Therefore, this suggests that the angular velocity is ω = [(a + b)/b]θ', which matches the velocity argument.\n\nBut earlier, the arc length argument gave φ = (a/b)θ. Where is the error there?\n\nAh! The arc length argument assumed that the arc length on the fixed sphere is aθ, and equated it to the arc length on the rolling sphere bφ. However, this is only true if the rolling sphere is rolling on a flat surface. But when it's rolling on another sphere, the rotation is not just due to the contact point moving along the fixed sphere, but also due to the fact that the center is moving along a larger circle. Hence, the total rotation is the sum of the rotation due to the contact and the rotation due to the orbital motion. Wait, but in reality, it's not a sum, but rather a combined effect.\n\nWait, if the center moves through an angle θ, then the rolling sphere has to rotate both because it's moving around the fixed sphere and because it's rolling. But in reality, the rotation is entirely due to the rolling without slipping condition, which relates the movement of the center to the rotation. Hence, the correct relation comes from the velocity argument: v = ω b, where v is the velocity of the center. Since v = (a + b)θ', then ω = (a + b)θ'/b. Therefore, φ = ∫ ω dt = [(a + b)/b] θ. Therefore, the previous arc length argument was wrong.\n\nBut why was there a discrepancy? Because when I considered the arc lengths, I equated the arc length on the fixed sphere (aθ) to the arc length on the rolling sphere (bφ). But this is incorrect because when the sphere rolls on another sphere, the rotation is not just due to the movement along the fixed sphere's surface, but also due to the movement of the center along its own path. Therefore, the correct relation comes from the velocity condition, not from equating arc lengths.\n\nTherefore, my initial arc length argument was wrong, and the velocity argument is correct. Hence, the angular acceleration α = dω/dt = [(a + b)/b] θ''.\n\nThis changes the previous derivation. Let me redo the torque equation with this corrected angular acceleration.\n\nTorque τ = f_s * b = I * α = I * [(a + b)/b] θ''.\n\nFor a solid sphere, I = (2/5) m b². Therefore:\n\nf_s * b = (2/5) m b² * [(a + b)/b] θ'' => f_s * b = (2/5) m b (a + b) θ'' => f_s = (2/5) m (a + b) θ''.\n\nNow, going back to the tangential equation of motion:\n\nm (a + b) θ'' = m g sin θ - f_s.\n\nSubstituting f_s:\n\nm (a + b) θ'' = m g sin θ - (2/5) m (a + b) θ''.\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n(a + b) θ'' = g sin θ - (2/5)(a + b) θ''.\n\nBring the term with θ'' to the left:\n\n(a + b) θ'' + (2/5)(a + b) θ'' = g sin θ.\n\nFactor out θ'':\n\nθ'' [ (a + b) + (2/5)(a + b) ] = g sin θ => θ'' [ (1 + 2/5)(a + b) ] = g sin θ => θ'' [ (7/5)(a + b) ] = g sin θ.\n\nTherefore:\n\nθ'' = [ g sin θ ] / [ (7/5)(a + b) ] = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ.\n\nSo the differential equation is:\n\nθ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ.\n\nThis is different from my initial result. This suggests that my first derivation was wrong due to an incorrect rolling without slipping condition. Now, with the corrected angular acceleration, the differential equation becomes θ'' proportional to sin θ with a denominator of 7(a + b).\n\nLet me verify this with another approach, using energy conservation, since there is no kinetic friction (μ_d = 0) and assuming static friction does no work.\n\nIf energy is conserved, then the potential energy lost equals the kinetic energy gained. Let's check if this gives the same equation.\n\nThe potential energy at angle θ is U = -mg(a + b)(1 - cos θ), taking the reference point at θ = 0.\n\nThe kinetic energy T is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energy:\n\nT = (1/2) m v² + (1/2) I ω².\n\nWith v = (a + b)θ', I = (2/5) m b², and ω = [(a + b)/b] θ', so:\n\nT = (1/2) m (a + b)² (θ')² + (1/2)(2/5 m b²)[(a + b)/b θ']²\n\nSimplify:\n\nT = (1/2) m (a + b)² (θ')² + (1/5) m b² [(a + b)² / b²] (θ')²\n\n= (1/2) m (a + b)² (θ')² + (1/5) m (a + b)² (θ')²\n\n= [ (1/2) + (1/5) ] m (a + b)² (θ')²\n\n= (7/10) m (a + b)² (θ')².\n\nTherefore, total mechanical energy is conserved:\n\nT + U = constant.\n\nTaking derivative with respect to time:\n\nd/dt [ (7/10) m (a + b)² (θ')² - mg(a + b)(1 - cos θ) ] = 0.\n\nDifferentiating:\n\n(7/10) m (a + b)² * 2 θ' θ'' + mg(a + b) sin θ θ' = 0.\n\nDivide by m(a + b)θ':\n\n(7/5)(a + b) θ'' + g sin θ = 0.\n\nWait, but this gives:\n\n(7/5)(a + b) θ'' + g sin θ = 0 => θ'' = - [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ.\n\nBut earlier, from the force method, we had θ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ. There is a sign difference here. Why?\n\nBecause in the energy approach, I took U = -mg(a + b)(1 - cos θ), assuming θ is measured from the top. Wait, let me check the potential energy. If θ is measured from the top, then as θ increases, the height decreases. Let me define the potential energy properly.\n\nAssume the zero of potential energy is at the top (θ = 0). Then, when the sphere has rolled down to angle θ, its center is at a height lower by (a + b)(1 - cos θ). Therefore, the potential energy is U = -mg(a + b)(1 - cos θ). Wait, but if θ increases downward, then the derivative dU/dθ would be related to the force. Let me check the derivative.\n\nThe kinetic energy plus potential energy is conserved:\n\nT + U = constant.\n\nTaking derivative:\n\nd/dt(T + U) = 0.\n\nFrom the energy expression:\n\n(7/5)(a + b) θ'' + g sin θ = 0 => θ'' = - [g / ( (7/5)(a + b) ) ] sin θ = - [5g / (7(a + b)) ] sin θ.\n\nBut in the force approach, I had θ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ. The sign difference suggests a problem. Where is the mistake?\n\nLooking back at the force approach: the equation from Newton's law was:\n\n(a + b) θ'' = g sin θ - (2/5)(a + b) θ''.\n\nWhich rearranged to:\n\n(a + b)θ'' + (2/5)(a + b)θ'' = g sin θ => θ'' [ (a + b)(1 + 2/5) ] = g sin θ => θ'' [ (7/5)(a + b) ] = g sin θ => θ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ.\n\nBut from energy, we have θ'' = - [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ.\n\nThis discrepancy in sign must be resolved. It likely comes from the direction of θ. In the force approach, I assumed θ increases in the direction of motion, and the acceleration θ'' is positive in that direction. In the energy approach, the derivative led to a negative sign, which suggests that the acceleration is opposite to the direction of increasing θ. This is contradictory.\n\nWait, let me think again about the coordinate system. If θ is measured from the top, increasing clockwise (say), then as the sphere rolls down, θ increases. The potential energy U = -mg(a + b)(1 - cos θ) is negative because it's below the reference point. The derivative dU/dθ = mg(a + b) sin θ. The force is -dU/dθ = -mg(a + b) sin θ. Wait, but torque or force?\n\nActually, in the energy approach, the equation came from d/dt(T + U) = 0. Let me re-examine that.\n\nThe total derivative:\n\nd/dt [T + U] = dT/dt + dU/dt = 0.\n\nFrom earlier, we had:\n\n(7/5)(a + b) θ'' + g sin θ = 0.\n\nBut let me rederive it step by step.\n\nT = (7/10) m (a + b)^2 (θ')^2\n\nU = -mg(a + b)(1 - cos θ)\n\nSo dT/dt = (7/10) m (a + b)^2 * 2 θ' θ'' = (7/5) m (a + b)^2 θ' θ''.\n\ndU/dt = -mg(a + b) sin θ * θ'.\n\nTherefore, dT/dt + dU/dt = 0:\n\n(7/5) m (a + b)^2 θ' θ'' - mg(a + b) sin θ θ' = 0.\n\nDivide by m(a + b)θ':\n\n(7/5)(a + b) θ'' - g sin θ = 0 => θ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ.\n\nAh! Previously I had a sign error in the energy derivation. Earlier, I incorrectly wrote + g sin θ θ', but it should be - g sin θ θ'. So the correct equation is θ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ, matching the force approach. Great, so the previous sign discrepancy was due to an error in the energy derivation step.\n\nTherefore, both methods give θ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ. Therefore, this must be the correct differential equation.\n\nSo where was the mistake in the earlier arc length argument? Initially, I thought that the rotation angle φ was (a/b)θ, but that was incorrect. The correct relation comes from the velocity condition v = ω b, leading to ω = [(a + b)/b]θ', hence φ = [(a + b)/b]θ. This accounts for both the rotation due to the movement along the fixed sphere and the rotation due to the center's orbital motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct differential equation is θ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ.\n\nLet me check dimensions to be sure. The right-hand side has units of g (m/s²) divided by (a + b) (m), so overall units are 1/s², which matches θ'' (radians per second squared). Radians are dimensionless, so yes, the units are correct.\n\nAnother sanity check: if the rolling sphere were a point mass (i.e., b approaches 0), then the moment of inertia I approaches 0, so the equation should reduce to θ'' = [g / (a + b)] sin θ. But as b approaches 0, a + b ≈ a, so θ'' ≈ g/a sin θ. However, for a point mass sliding without friction on a sphere, the equation of motion is θ'' = (g/a) sin θ, which matches. Therefore, this suggests that our equation is correct in the limit of a point mass. Hence, the factor of 5/7 comes from the moment of inertia of the rolling sphere. For a solid sphere, the 5/7 factor is correct compared to the point mass case. Therefore, this gives me more confidence.\n\nTherefore, the differential equation of motion for the sphere undergoing pure rolling is:\n\nθ'' = [5g / (7(a + b))] sin θ.\n\nSo the answer should be written as:\n\n$$\n\\ddot{\\theta} = \\frac{5g}{7(a + b)} \\sin\\theta\n$$\n\nOr in boxed form:\n\n\\boxed{\\ddot{\\theta} = \\dfrac{5g}{7(a + b)} \\sin\\theta}\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe differential equation of motion is \\boxed{\\ddot{\\theta} = \\dfrac{5g}{7(a + b)} \\sin\\theta}.\n</think>"}
