Vitamin C is an antioxidant and can indeed reduce reactive oxygen free radicals, which is correct.","step2: Analyze option B: Proteins can only be catalytically hydrolyzed by proteases. This is incorrect because proteins can be hydrolyzed by a variety of substances, such as strong acids, strong bases, certain organic solvents, etc., and are not limited to proteases.","Step 3: Analyze option C: Starch can be artificially synthesized using CO₂ as raw material. Plants synthesize glucose using CO₂ as raw material through photosynthesis, and then synthesize starch. This is correct.","Step 4: Analyze Option D: Nucleic acids can be regarded as the polymerization products of nucleotides. Nucleic acids are indeed polymers formed by nucleotides linked through phosphodiester bonds, and this is correct.","Step 5: Therefore, option B is incorrect, the answer is B"]}},"question_type":"Easy","category":"chemistry","subcategory":"organic chemistry","prediction":"To determine the incorrect statement regarding the relationship between chemicals and life processes, let's evaluate each option carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: \"Vitamin C can reduce active oxygen free radicals.\"**  \nThis is **correct**. Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is a well-known antioxidant. It neutralizes free radicals by donating electrons, thus reducing oxidative damage in the body. This makes it effective in counteracting harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: \"Proteins can only be hydrolyzed by proteases.\"**  \nThis is **incorrect**. While **proteases** are the primary biological agents responsible for the hydrolysis of proteins by breaking peptide bonds, they are **not the only means**. Under **strong acidic or basic conditions**, proteins can also undergo hydrolysis **chemically**, without the need for enzymes. For example, boiling a protein in a strong acid or base can break down the peptide bonds. Therefore, the use of the word **\"only\"** in this statement makes it **false**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: \"Starch can be artificially synthesized using CO₂ as a raw material.\"**  \nThis is **correct**. While plants naturally produce starch through photosynthesis using CO₂ and water, scientists have also developed **artificial pathways** to synthesize starch from CO₂. A notable example is the work done by researchers in China, who created a process to convert CO₂ into starch without the need for photosynthesis, demonstrating the feasibility of this statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: \"Nucleic acids can be regarded as the polymerization product of nucleotides.\"**  \nThis is **correct**. Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are **polymers** made up of repeating units of **nucleotides**. These nucleotides link together via phosphodiester bonds to form the long chains that constitute nucleic acids.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final Answer: (B) Proteins can only be hydrolyzed by proteases.**  \nThis statement is **incorrect** because proteins can also be hydrolyzed under strong chemical conditions, not just by proteases.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about which statement regarding chemicals related to life processes is incorrect. The options are A to D. I need to figure out which one is wrong.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Vitamin C can reduce active oxygen free radicals.\" I remember that antioxidants like Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) work by donating electrons to free radicals, thus neutralizing them. So A seems correct. \n\nOption B: \"Proteins can only be hydrolyzed by proteases.\" Hmm, hydrolysis of proteins usually requires breaking peptide bonds. Proteases are enzymes that do that, but does \"only\" make this statement incorrect? Wait, could there be other ways to hydrolyze proteins? Like under strong acidic or basic conditions without enzymes? For example, in the stomach, HCl helps denature proteins, and pepsin (a protease) breaks them down. But if you have strong acid or base, maybe you can hydrolyze proteins without enzymes. So if B says \"only\" proteases, then that's incorrect because chemical hydrolysis is possible. So B might be the incorrect statement.\n\nOption C: \"Starch can be artificially synthesized using CO2 as a raw material.\" Starch is a carbohydrate made by plants via photosynthesis from CO2 and water. Artificial synthesis... there's been research on creating starch from CO2, like in some lab experiments. For example, Chinese scientists did something like that a few years back, using a process to convert CO2 into starch without photosynthesis. So C might be correct.\n\nOption D: \"Nucleic acids can be regarded as the polymerization product of nucleotides.\" Yes, nucleic acids like DNA and RNA are polymers formed by linking nucleotides. So D is correct.\n\nSo the incorrect statement is B. Proteins can be hydrolyzed not only by proteases but also by chemical means under harsh conditions. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n</think>"}
