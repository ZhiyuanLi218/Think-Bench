And then I need to find n. Alright, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, m is an integer, and its cube root is just a little bit more than an integer n. Specifically, the \"little bit more\" is less than 1/1000. So, m is the smallest integer such that when you take its cube root, it's just barely larger than some integer n. So, m is the next integer after n³, but not too far. The difference between m and n³ is such that the cube root of m is less than n + 1/1000. Wait, actually, r is less than 1/1000, so cube root of m is less than n + 1/1000. Therefore, m is less than (n + 1/1000)³. But m has to be an integer, so the smallest m for each n would be the smallest integer greater than n³? Wait, but we need m to be such that cube root of m is n + r with r < 1/1000. So m must be the smallest integer such that m > n³ (since r is positive) and m < (n + 1/1000)³. Wait, but if m is the smallest integer greater than n³, then m = n³ + 1. But we need that m < (n + 1/1000)³. So, for each n, check if n³ + 1 < (n + 1/1000)³. If that's true, then m = n³ + 1 would satisfy the condition. If not, then maybe we need a larger m? But since we want the smallest m overall, we need to find the smallest n such that there exists an integer m between n³ and (n + 1/1000)³. So, the idea is to find the smallest n where the interval (n³, (n + 1/1000)³) contains at least one integer. Since m must be an integer, so the length of the interval must be greater than 1? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because even if the interval is less than 1, there might still be an integer in it. For example, if n³ is just below an integer, then adding a little bit might cross over. However, since n³ is an integer, the next integer is n³ + 1. Therefore, the question reduces to: find the smallest n such that (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1? Because if the difference between (n + 1/1000)^3 and n³ is greater than 1, then there must be an integer between them. If the difference is less than 1, then maybe there isn't an integer between them. Wait, but actually, since n³ is integer and (n + 1/1000)^3 is not, then if (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1, then there must be at least one integer between them. If the difference is less than 1, there might not be an integer between them. Therefore, the minimal m would be n³ + 1 if (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1. But if the difference is less than 1, then n³ + 1 is not less than (n + 1/1000)^3, meaning that the next integer m would have to be higher. However, since we want the smallest m overall, we need to find the smallest n such that (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1. Because once that's true, then m = n³ + 1 is less than (n + 1/1000)^3, so cube root of m is less than n + 1/1000, so r is less than 1/1000. Therefore, the problem reduces to solving for n in the inequality:\n\n(n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1.\n\nLet me compute that difference. Let me expand (n + 1/1000)^3:\n\n= n³ + 3n²*(1/1000) + 3n*(1/1000)^2 + (1/1000)^3 - n³\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 3n²/1000 + 3n/(1000)^2 + 1/(1000)^3\n\nSo we need:\n\n3n²/1000 + 3n/(10^6) + 1/(10^9) > 1.\n\nSince 1/(10^9) is negligible compared to the other terms, maybe we can approximate:\n\n3n² / 1000 ≈ 1 => n² ≈ 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.333... => n ≈ sqrt(333.333) ≈ 18.257...\n\nSo maybe n is around 19? But let me check more precisely.\n\nBut we need to solve 3n²/1000 + 3n/(10^6) + 1/(10^9) > 1.\n\nLet me compute the exact value for n. Let's denote:\n\nLet me write the inequality:\n\n3n²/1000 + 3n/1,000,000 + 1/1,000,000,000 > 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 1,000,000,000 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3n² * 1,000,000 + 3n * 1000 + 1 > 1,000,000,000.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 3n² * 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 n²\n\nSecond term: 3n * 1000 = 3,000 n\n\nThird term: 1\n\nSo overall:\n\n3,000,000 n² + 3,000 n + 1 > 1,000,000,000.\n\nSince 3,000 n is much smaller than 3,000,000 n², and 1 is negligible, we can approximate:\n\n3,000,000 n² > 1,000,000,000 => n² > 1,000,000,000 / 3,000,000 = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.333...\n\nTherefore, n² > 333.333... => n > sqrt(333.333) ≈ 18.257. Therefore, n ≥ 19. However, we need to check if for n=19, the original inequality holds.\n\nLet me compute for n=19:\n\nCompute 3*(19)^2 / 1000 + 3*(19)/1,000,000 + 1/1,000,000,000.\n\nFirst term: 3*(361)/1000 = 1083 / 1000 = 1.083\n\nSecond term: 57 / 1,000,000 = 0.000057\n\nThird term: 0.000000001\n\nTotal ≈ 1.083 + 0.000057 + 0.000000001 ≈ 1.083057...\n\nWhich is greater than 1. Therefore, for n=19, the difference between (n + 1/1000)^3 and n³ is approximately 1.083, which is greater than 1. Therefore, there is an integer m between n³ and (n + 1/1000)^3, specifically m = n³ + 1. Therefore, for n=19, m=19³ +1 is such that cube root of m is less than 19 + 1/1000. Therefore, r < 1/1000. However, the problem asks for the smallest m. So maybe there is a smaller n where even though the difference is less than 1, there is an integer m such that n³ < m < (n + 1/1000)^3. Because if the difference is less than 1, but the next integer after n³ is still less than (n + 1/1000)^3. Wait, but n³ is an integer, so the next integer is n³ + 1. Therefore, if (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1, then n³ + 1 < (n + 1/1000)^3, so m = n³ + 1 is valid. If the difference is less than 1, then n³ + 1 might be larger than (n + 1/1000)^3, so m would have to be higher. However, since we want the smallest m overall, maybe for smaller n's, even though the difference is less than 1, maybe there is some m such that m is in the interval [n³ + something, (n + 1/1000)^3]. Wait, but m has to be integer. Since n³ is integer, and (n + 1/1000)^3 is not, the next integer after n³ is n³ + 1. Therefore, if (n + 1/1000)^3 is greater than n³ + 1, then m = n³ + 1 is valid. If it's less than n³ + 1, then there is no integer m between n³ and (n + 1/1000)^3. Therefore, the condition is exactly (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1. Therefore, the minimal n where this is true is n=19, as we saw. However, let's check for n=18. Let me compute the difference for n=18:\n\nCompute 3*(18)^2 / 1000 + 3*(18)/1,000,000 + 1/1,000,000,000.\n\nFirst term: 3*(324)/1000 = 972 / 1000 = 0.972\n\nSecond term: 54 / 1,000,000 = 0.000054\n\nThird term: 0.000000001\n\nTotal ≈ 0.972 + 0.000054 + 0.000000001 ≈ 0.972054..., which is less than 1. Therefore, for n=18, the difference between (18 + 1/1000)^3 and 18³ is approximately 0.972, which is less than 1. Therefore, there is no integer m between 18³ and (18 + 1/1000)^3. Therefore, for n=18, the next integer m=18³ +1 = 5832 + 1 = 5833. Let's check if cube root of 5833 is less than 18 + 1/1000.\n\nCompute (18 + 1/1000)^3 = ?\n\nFirst, 18.001³. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's recall that (a + b)^3 = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³.\n\nSo, a = 18, b = 0.001.\n\nTherefore, (18 + 0.001)^3 = 18³ + 3*(18²)*0.001 + 3*18*(0.001)^2 + (0.001)^3.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n18³ = 5832.\n\n3*(18²)*0.001 = 3*324*0.001 = 972*0.001 = 0.972.\n\n3*18*(0.001)^2 = 54*(0.000001) = 0.000054.\n\n(0.001)^3 = 0.000000001.\n\nAdding them up: 5832 + 0.972 + 0.000054 + 0.000000001 ≈ 5832.972054...\n\nSo, (18.001)^3 ≈ 5832.972054...\n\nBut m = 5833 is larger than this value. Therefore, cube root of 5833 is larger than 18.001. Therefore, r would be greater than 1/1000. Therefore, m=5833 does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, for n=18, there is no such m. Therefore, the next candidate is n=19.\n\nFor n=19, let's compute (19 + 1/1000)^3.\n\nAgain, using the same formula:\n\n(19 + 0.001)^3 = 19³ + 3*(19²)*0.001 + 3*19*(0.001)^2 + (0.001)^3.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n19³ = 6859.\n\n3*(19²)*0.001 = 3*(361)*0.001 = 1083 * 0.001 = 1.083.\n\n3*19*(0.001)^2 = 57 * 0.000001 = 0.000057.\n\n(0.001)^3 = 0.000000001.\n\nAdding them up: 6859 + 1.083 + 0.000057 + 0.000000001 ≈ 6860.083057...\n\nTherefore, (19.001)^3 ≈ 6860.083...\n\nTherefore, m needs to be an integer less than 6860.083... So the next integer after 19³ is 19³ + 1 = 6859 + 1 = 6860. Therefore, m=6860 is less than 6860.083..., so cube root of 6860 is less than 19.001. Therefore, r < 1/1000. Therefore, m=6860 is valid for n=19. Therefore, if there is a smaller n where such m exists, then we need to check. But for n=18, we saw that m=5833 is too big. What about n=17?\n\nLet me check for n=17. Let's compute the difference between (n + 1/1000)^3 and n³.\n\nCompute 3*(17)^2 / 1000 + 3*(17)/1,000,000 + 1/1,000,000,000.\n\nFirst term: 3*(289)/1000 = 867/1000 = 0.867\n\nSecond term: 51 / 1,000,000 = 0.000051\n\nThird term: negligible.\n\nTotal ≈ 0.867 + 0.000051 ≈ 0.867051 < 1. Therefore, same as before, the difference is less than 1. Therefore, m=17³ +1 = 4913 + 1 = 4914. Let's check if cube root of 4914 is less than 17.001. Compute (17.001)^3.\n\nAgain, using the formula:\n\n(17 + 0.001)^3 = 17³ + 3*(17²)*0.001 + 3*17*(0.001)^2 + (0.001)^3.\n\n17³ = 4913.\n\n3*(289)*0.001 = 867*0.001 = 0.867.\n\n3*17*0.000001 = 0.000051.\n\nPlus 0.000000001.\n\nTotal: 4913 + 0.867 + 0.000051 + ... ≈ 4913.867051...\n\nTherefore, (17.001)^3 ≈ 4913.867. Therefore, m=4914 is greater than this value, so cube root of 4914 is greater than 17.001. Therefore, r would be greater than 1/1000. Therefore, invalid. Therefore, n=17 doesn't work. Similarly, lower n's would have even smaller differences. Therefore, n=19 is the first n where (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1, so that m = n³ + 1 is less than (n + 1/1000)^3. Therefore, the answer is n=19? Wait, but the problem says \"the smallest integer m\", so maybe there is a smaller m for higher n? Wait, no. Wait, m is supposed to be the smallest integer such that its cube root is n + r with r < 1/1000. So for each n, there might be such an m, but we need the smallest m overall. However, if n increases, n³ increases, so m = n³ +1 would be larger. Therefore, the minimal m would be achieved at the minimal n for which such m exists. Since for n=19, m=6860 is valid, and for n=18 and lower, there is no such m. Therefore, the answer is n=19. Therefore, the answer is 19. But let me check for n=19, is m=6860 indeed the minimal m? For example, could there be a smaller m for a higher n? For example, maybe for some n >19, there is an m smaller than 6860? But since m must be greater than n³, and n³ increases with n, so for n >19, n³ is larger than 19³, so m would have to be larger. Therefore, the minimal m is indeed for the minimal n, which is 19. Therefore, the answer is 19.\n\nBut let me check for n=19, if there is a smaller m? For example, maybe m is not n³ +1 but something else? But since m has to be the first integer after n³ where cube root(m) - n < 1/1000. However, since we have that (n + 1/1000)^3 is approximately 6860.083, so the integers from 6859 + 1 = 6860 up to floor( (n + 1/1000)^3 ) which is 6860. So only m=6860. Therefore, yes, m=6860 is the only integer in that interval, and it's the minimal m for n=19. Therefore, since there are no smaller n's with valid m's, n=19 is the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there is an n between 18 and 19... Wait, n must be integer. So no. Therefore, n=19 is the minimal n. Therefore, the answer is 19. Wait, but let me check if my calculation for n=19 is correct. Let me compute cube root of 6860. Let me check what's 19.001³ ≈ 6860.083. Therefore, cube root of 6860.083 is 19.001, so cube root of 6860 is 19.001 - a tiny bit. Therefore, r is approximately 0.001 - tiny bit. Therefore, less than 1/1000. Therefore, yes. Therefore, r < 1/1000. Therefore, m=6860 is valid. Therefore, n=19 is the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there is a smaller m for some higher n? For example, maybe for some n >19, the value of m = n³ + k is smaller than 6860? For example, if n=10, n³=1000, but since for n=10, the required m would have to satisfy cube root(m) < 10 + 0.001, so m < (10.001)^3 ≈ 1000.300... + ... Let me compute (10.001)^3. Again, 10³ + 3*10²*0.001 + ... = 1000 + 3*100*0.001 + ... = 1000 + 0.3 + 0.00003 + ... ≈ 1000.30003. Therefore, m must be less than ~1000.3. Therefore, the only integer m is 1000 and 1001. But m must be greater than 10³=1000, so m=1001. But cube root of 1001 is 10 + r. What is r? Let me compute 10 + r = cube root(1001). Let me approximate. Since 10³=1000, 10.001³≈1000.3. Therefore, cube root(1001) ≈ 10 + (1)/ (3*10²) approximately, using linear approximation. The derivative of x³ is 3x², so inverse derivative is 1/(3x²). Therefore, cube root(1000 + 1) ≈ 10 + 1/(3*(10)^2) = 10 + 1/300 ≈ 10.003333... So r ≈ 0.003333..., which is greater than 1/1000=0.001. Therefore, m=1001 does not satisfy r < 1/1000. Therefore, for n=10, there is no such m. Similarly, for higher n's up to 18, same problem. For n=19, m=6860 works. Therefore, seems like n=19 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=19, if there is a smaller m. For example, maybe m is not n³ +1 but some other number? Well, since (n + 1/1000)^3 ≈ 6860.083, so the integers between n³ and that are 6859 + 1 = 6860 only. Because 6859 is n³, then next integer is 6860, and then the upper bound is ~6860.083, so only 6860 is in between. Therefore, m=6860 is the only one. Therefore, yes, it's valid. Therefore, n=19 is the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check for n=19, compute cube root(6860) and see how much it is. Let me try to approximate cube root(6860). Since 19³=6859, so cube root(6859)=19. Then cube root(6860)=19 + ε. Let me compute ε.\n\nUsing linear approximation again. Let f(x) = cube root(x). f'(x) = (1/3)x^(-2/3). At x=6859, f'(x) = 1/(3*(6859)^(2/3)). But 6859^(1/3)=19, so 6859^(2/3)=19²=361. Therefore, f'(6859)=1/(3*361)=1/1083≈0.000923. Therefore, the approximate change in f(x) when x increases by 1 (from 6859 to 6860) is approximately 1 * 0.000923 ≈ 0.000923. Therefore, cube root(6860) ≈ 19 + 0.000923, which is less than 19 + 0.001. Therefore, r≈0.000923 < 1/1000=0.001. Therefore, yes, it satisfies the condition. Therefore, m=6860 is valid, with n=19. Therefore, since there is no smaller n for which such m exists, the answer is 19.\n\nBut let me check n=19 is indeed the minimal. Let me check for n=18.5? No, n must be integer. How about n=19? Yes. What if there is some n where the difference (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ is less than 1, but still m exists? For example, maybe for some n, even though (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ < 1, but because of the positioning of n³, the next integer m=n³ +1 is still less than (n + 1/1000)^3? Wait, but that would mean that (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ > 1, which is the condition we had. Therefore, if the difference is less than 1, then m=n³ +1 is larger than (n + 1/1000)^3. Therefore, no. Therefore, only when the difference is greater than 1, m=n³ +1 is less than (n + 1/1000)^3. Therefore, our initial reasoning holds. Therefore, n=19 is the minimal n. Therefore, the answer is 19.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=19, the exact value of (n + 1/1000)^3 - n³ is approx 1.083, so there is some space. Therefore, m=6860 is valid, but also m=6861 would also be less than (n + 1/1000)^3? Wait, (n + 1/1000)^3 ≈ 6860.083, so m=6861 is larger than that. Therefore, only m=6860 is in between. Therefore, only one m. Therefore, yes.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: n=19. Therefore, the answer is 19. Wait, but let me check once more with exact computation. Let me compute (19 + 1/1000)^3 - 19³. Which is 3*(19)^2*(1/1000) + 3*(19)*(1/1000)^2 + (1/1000)^3. So:\n\nFirst term: 3*361*0.001 = 3*0.361 = 1.083.\n\nSecond term: 3*19*(0.000001) = 57*0.000001 = 0.000057.\n\nThird term: 0.000000001.\n\nTotal: 1.083 + 0.000057 + 0.000000001 = 1.083057... So, approx 1.083. Therefore, the difference is approx 1.083. Therefore, m can be n³ + 1, which is 6859 + 1 = 6860, and since the difference is 1.083, then 6860 is 1 less than n³ + 1.083, so it is within the interval. Therefore, valid. Therefore, n=19 is correct.\n\nBut let me check for n=19, if there is a smaller m. For example, suppose there is some m less than 6860 which is greater than (n-1 + 1/1000)^3? But m has to be greater than some n³. For example, if m is between (n-1 + 1/1000)^3 and (n-1 + something). But since we need the minimal m overall, which would be for the minimal n. Since for n=1 to 18, there is no valid m, so the minimal m is for n=19. Therefore, answer is 19.\n\nBut let me check for n=19, if m=6860 is indeed the minimal m. Suppose there is a smaller m for a larger n? For example, maybe for n=20, m=20³ +1 = 8000 + 1 = 8001, which is bigger than 6860. Therefore, no. Therefore, 6860 is indeed smaller. Therefore, answer is 19. Therefore, I think the answer is 19.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose we need to find the smallest m such that there exists integer n with:\n\nn < cube_root(m) < n + 1/1000.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nn³ < m < (n + 1/1000)^3.\n\nSince m must be integer, the question is to find the smallest m such that there exists n with m in (n³, (n + 1/1000)^3). So, equivalently, find the smallest m such that there exists n with m > n³ and m < (n + 0.001)^3.\n\nTherefore, for each m, check if there exists n such that n³ < m < (n + 0.001)^3. But since we need the smallest m, we can think of starting from m=1 upwards and check.\n\nBut this approach is not feasible manually, but maybe we can think in terms of when does (n + 0.001)^3 - n³ > 1, which is when m=n³ +1 exists. Therefore, as before, n≈19.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there exists some m where for some n, m is not n³ +1 but still in the interval. For example, maybe for some n, the interval (n³, (n + 0.001)^3) contains multiple integers. For example, if the difference is 2, then there are two integers. But since we need the smallest m, it would be n³ +1. Therefore, the first occurrence when the interval contains at least one integer is when the difference exceeds 1, so n≈19.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 19. Therefore, I think the answer is \\boxed{19}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{19}\n</think>"}
