And P(x) is given as x⁶ - x⁵ - x³ - x² - x. \n\nFirst, let me recall that if z is a root of Q(x), then Q(z) = 0. That means z⁴ - z³ - z² - 1 = 0. Maybe I can use this equation to simplify higher powers of z in P(z). Since P(x) has terms up to x⁶, I might need to express z⁶ and lower powers in terms of lower-degree terms using the relation from Q(z).\n\nLet me start by writing down Q(z) = 0:\n\nz⁴ = z³ + z² + 1.\n\nSo, if I can find expressions for z⁵ and z⁶ in terms of lower powers of z, I can substitute them into P(z). Let me try that.\n\nFirst, z⁴ = z³ + z² + 1.\n\nTo find z⁵, multiply both sides by z:\n\nz⁵ = z⁴ + z³ + z.\n\nBut z⁴ can be replaced again with z³ + z² + 1:\n\nz⁵ = (z³ + z² + 1) + z³ + z = 2z³ + z² + z + 1.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nOriginal z⁵ = z * z⁴ = z*(z³ + z² + 1) = z⁴ + z³ + z. Then substitute z⁴ again:\n\nz⁴ = z³ + z² + 1, so z⁵ becomes (z³ + z² + 1) + z³ + z = 2z³ + z² + z + 1. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, for z⁶, multiply z⁵ by z:\n\nz⁶ = z * z⁵ = z*(2z³ + z² + z + 1) = 2z⁴ + z³ + z² + z.\n\nAgain, substitute z⁴:\n\nz⁶ = 2*(z³ + z² + 1) + z³ + z² + z = 2z³ + 2z² + 2 + z³ + z² + z.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2z³ + z³) + (2z² + z²) + z + 2 = 3z³ + 3z² + z + 2.\n\nOkay, so now I have expressions for z⁴, z⁵, z⁶ in terms of lower-degree terms. Let me write them again:\n\nz⁴ = z³ + z² + 1,\n\nz⁵ = 2z³ + z² + z + 1,\n\nz⁶ = 3z³ + 3z² + z + 2.\n\nNow, let's substitute these into P(z):\n\nP(z) = z⁶ - z⁵ - z³ - z² - z.\n\nSubstituting each term:\n\n= [3z³ + 3z² + z + 2] - [2z³ + z² + z + 1] - z³ - z² - z.\n\nLet me compute this step by step. First, expand the brackets:\n\nFirst term: 3z³ + 3z² + z + 2\n\nSecond term: -2z³ - z² - z - 1\n\nThird term: -z³\n\nFourth term: -z²\n\nFifth term: -z\n\nNow combine all these terms:\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\nFor z³: 3z³ - 2z³ - z³ = 0.\n\nFor z²: 3z² - z² - z² = 1z².\n\nFor z: z - z - z = -z.\n\nConstants: 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nStarting with z³ terms:\n\n3z³ (from first term) - 2z³ (from second term) - z³ (third term) = 3 - 2 -1 = 0. Correct.\n\nz² terms: 3z² (first term) - z² (second term) - z² (fourth term) = 3 -1 -1 = 1z².\n\nz terms: z (first term) - z (second term) - z (fifth term) = 1 -1 -1 = -1z.\n\nConstants: 2 (from first term) -1 (from second term) = 1. \n\nSo altogether, P(z) simplifies to 0*z³ + 1*z² - 1*z + 1, which is z² - z + 1.\n\nWait, so P(z) = z² - z + 1 for each root z of Q(x)?\n\nSo then, if that's the case, then the sum P(z₁) + P(z₂) + P(z₃) + P(z₄) is equal to [z₁² - z₁ + 1] + [z₂² - z₂ + 1] + [z₃² - z₃ + 1] + [z₄² - z₄ + 1].\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (z₁² + z₂² + z₃² + z₄²) - (z₁ + z₂ + z₃ + z₄) + 4*1.\n\nSo, we need to compute the sum of squares of the roots, the sum of the roots, and then plug them in here.\n\nGiven that Q(x) = x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1. Let me recall Vieta's formula for quartic equations. For a quartic equation x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0, the sum of roots is -a, the sum of products two at a time is b, the sum of products three at a time is -c, and the product of all four roots is d.\n\nBut our Q(x) is x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1. Let me write it in standard form:\n\nx⁴ + (-1)x³ + (-1)x² + 0x + (-1) = 0.\n\nTherefore, coefficients are:\n\na = -1, b = -1, c = 0, d = -1.\n\nTherefore, sum of roots z₁ + z₂ + z₃ + z₄ = -a = 1.\n\nSum of products two at a time: z₁z₂ + z₁z₃ + z₁z₄ + z₂z₃ + z₂z₄ + z₃z₄ = b = -1.\n\nSum of products three at a time: z₁z₂z₃ + z₁z₂z₄ + z₁z₃z₄ + z₂z₃z₄ = -c = 0.\n\nProduct of roots: z₁z₂z₃z₄ = d = -1.\n\nOkay, so we need sum of squares of roots. There's a formula for that: sum z_i² = (sum z_i)² - 2*sum z_i z_j.\n\nSo, using Vieta's formulas:\n\nsum z_i² = (sum z_i)^2 - 2*(sum z_i z_j) = (1)^2 - 2*(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nTherefore, sum z_i² = 3.\n\nTherefore, going back to the expression:\n\nsum P(z_i) = sum z_i² - sum z_i + 4 = 3 - 1 + 4 = 6.\n\nWait, so the answer is 6? Let me check my steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, simplifying P(z) for each root z:\n\nOriginal P(z) = z⁶ - z⁵ - z³ - z² - z. Then, substituting z⁶, z⁵, etc., using Q(z) = 0. We found that P(z) simplifies to z² - z + 1. Let me verify this again with an example. Suppose I take a root z, then:\n\nz⁴ = z³ + z² + 1.\n\nz⁵ = z*z⁴ = z*(z³ + z² + 1) = z⁴ + z³ + z = (z³ + z² + 1) + z³ + z = 2z³ + z² + z + 1. Correct.\n\nz⁶ = z*z⁵ = z*(2z³ + z² + z + 1) = 2z⁴ + z³ + z² + z. Then substitute z⁴:\n\n2*(z³ + z² + 1) + z³ + z² + z = 2z³ + 2z² + 2 + z³ + z² + z = 3z³ + 3z² + z + 2. Correct.\n\nThen P(z) = z⁶ - z⁵ - z³ - z² - z.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n[3z³ + 3z² + z + 2] - [2z³ + z² + z + 1] - z³ - z² - z.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFirst bracket: 3z³ + 3z² + z + 2\n\nMinus second bracket: -2z³ - z² - z - 1\n\nThen minus z³: - z³\n\nMinus z²: - z²\n\nMinus z: - z.\n\nSo adding all together:\n\nFor z³: 3z³ -2z³ - z³ = 0.\n\nFor z²: 3z² - z² - z² = 1z².\n\nFor z: z - z - z = -z.\n\nConstants: 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nYes, so indeed P(z) = z² - z + 1. Therefore, the rest follows.\n\nSum P(z_i) = sum z_i² - sum z_i + 4.\n\nSum z_i² is 3, sum z_i is 1, so 3 - 1 + 4 = 6. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 6. Let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe through polynomial division or something else, just to verify.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if we want to compute P(z₁) + P(z₂) + P(z₃) + P(z₄), since each z_i is a root of Q(x), perhaps we can think of this sum as evaluating something related to P(x) divided by Q(x), but since P(x) is degree 6 and Q(x) is degree 4, maybe there is a remainder?\n\nWait, if we perform polynomial division of P(x) by Q(x), then we can write P(x) = Q(x)*S(x) + R(x), where degree of R(x) is less than 4. Then, since Q(z_i) = 0, P(z_i) = R(z_i). Therefore, the sum P(z₁) + P(z₂) + P(z₃) + P(z₄) is equal to R(z₁) + R(z₂) + R(z₃) + R(z₄). If R(x) is a polynomial of degree less than 4, say R(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, then the sum over roots would be a*(sum z_i³) + b*(sum z_i²) + c*(sum z_i) + 4d. Which might be more complicated, but since we already found that P(z) = z² - z + 1, that would mean R(x) is z² - z + 1, so indeed, the sum would be sum z_i² - sum z_i + 4. Which is the same as before. So this method would also lead to the same result. But since we already did the substitution and found that P(z) reduces to z² - z + 1, maybe this is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice that substitution, I could do polynomial division. Let me try that as a check.\n\nDivide P(x) = x⁶ - x⁵ - x³ - x² - x by Q(x) = x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1.\n\nLet me perform polynomial long division.\n\nDivide x⁶ - x⁵ - x³ - x² - x by x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1.\n\nFirst term: x⁶ / x⁴ = x². Multiply divisor by x²: x²*(x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1) = x⁶ - x⁵ - x⁴ - x².\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x⁶ - x⁵ - x³ - x² - x) - (x⁶ - x⁵ - x⁴ - x²) =\n\n0x⁶ + 0x⁵ + x⁴ - x³ + 0x² - x = x⁴ - x³ - x.\n\nNow, divide x⁴ by x⁴: 1. Multiply divisor by 1: 1*(x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1) = x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1.\n\nSubtract this from the previous remainder:\n\n(x⁴ - x³ - x) - (x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1) = 0x⁴ + 0x³ + x² - x + 1 = x² - x + 1.\n\nSo the remainder is x² - x + 1, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, P(x) = Q(x)*(x² + 1) + (x² - x + 1). Wait, let me check the quotient:\n\nFirst term was x², then we added 1, so quotient is x² + 1? Let me check:\n\n(x² + 1)*Q(x) + remainder should be equal to P(x). Let me compute:\n\n(x² + 1)*(x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1) + x² - x + 1.\n\nFirst multiply out:\n\nx²*(x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1) + 1*(x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1) + x² - x + 1.\n\n= x⁶ - x⁵ - x⁴ - x² + x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1 + x² - x + 1.\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\nx⁶ - x⁵ + (-x⁴ + x⁴) + (-x³) + (-x² - x² + x²) + (-1 + 1) - x.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx⁶ - x⁵ - x³ - x² - x. Which is exactly P(x). Perfect! Therefore, P(x) = Q(x)*(x² + 1) + (x² - x + 1). Therefore, for each root z_i of Q(x), P(z_i) = 0*(x² + 1) + (x² - x + 1) evaluated at z_i, so indeed P(z_i) = z_i² - z_i + 1. Therefore, the sum is sum(z_i² - z_i + 1) = sum z_i² - sum z_i + 4, which we already calculated as 3 - 1 + 4 = 6. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, we arrive at 6. \n\nBut just to make sure that there's no miscalculation in Vieta's formula. Let me recast:\n\nGiven Q(x) = x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1. Let me write Vieta's formula again. Let me denote the roots as z₁, z₂, z₃, z₄.\n\nSum z_i = z₁ + z₂ + z₃ + z₄ = coefficient of x³ term with opposite sign. Since Q(x) is x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1, which is x⁴ + (-1)x³ + (-1)x² + 0x + (-1). Therefore, sum z_i = -(-1) = 1. Correct.\n\nSum z_i z_j for i < j is coefficient of x² term, which is -1. Wait, Vieta's formula says for quartic x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d, sum z_i = -a, sum z_i z_j = b, sum z_i z_j z_k = -c, product z_i z_j z_k z_l = d. Therefore, here, sum z_i z_j is b, which is -1. Therefore, sum z_i² = (sum z_i)^2 - 2 sum z_i z_j = 1² - 2*(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 6. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute sum P(z_i) directly, maybe by some other method? For example, considering symmetric sums?\n\nBut since we already have a straightforward way, and verified through multiple approaches, I think it's safe to say that the answer is 6. \n\nJust to make sure, let me consider plugging in a specific root. However, solving Q(x) = 0 to find actual roots might be complicated, but maybe I can check with an approximate root?\n\nLet me try to find an approximate root of Q(x) = x⁴ - x³ - x² - 1. Let me try x=1: 1 -1 -1 -1 = -2. x=2: 16 - 8 -4 -1 = 3. So there is a root between 1 and 2. Let me try x=1.5: (5.0625) - (3.375) - (2.25) -1 = 5.0625 - 3.375 = 1.6875; 1.6875 - 2.25 = -0.5625; -0.5625 -1 = -1.5625. Still negative. x=1.75: (1.75)^4 - (1.75)^3 - (1.75)^2 -1. \n\nCompute 1.75^2 = 3.0625; 1.75^3 = 1.75*3.0625 ≈ 5.359375; 1.75^4 ≈ 1.75*5.359375 ≈ 9.37890625. Then subtract: 9.3789 - 5.3594 - 3.0625 -1 ≈ 9.3789 - 5.3594 = 4.0195; 4.0195 - 3.0625 = 0.957; 0.957 -1 ≈ -0.043. Close to zero. So at x=1.75, Q(x) ≈ -0.043. Try x=1.76:\n\nCompute 1.76^2 = 3.0976; 1.76^3 = 1.76*3.0976 ≈ 5.450; 1.76^4 ≈ 1.76*5.45 ≈ 9.592. Then Q(1.76) ≈ 9.592 - 5.45 - 3.0976 -1 ≈ 9.592 - 5.45 = 4.142; 4.142 - 3.0976 ≈ 1.0444; 1.0444 -1 = 0.0444. So between 1.75 and 1.76, the root crosses zero. Let's take an approximate root z ≈ 1.755.\n\nNow compute P(z) = z⁶ - z⁵ - z³ - z² - z. But according to our formula, it should be z² - z + 1. Let's check both.\n\nFirst compute z² - z + 1 for z ≈ 1.755:\n\nz² ≈ (1.755)^2 ≈ 3.08; z ≈ 1.755. Then z² - z + 1 ≈ 3.08 - 1.755 + 1 ≈ 3.08 - 1.755 = 1.325 + 1 = 2.325.\n\nNow compute P(z):\n\nz^6 - z^5 - z^3 - z^2 - z. Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, z ≈ 1.755.\n\nCompute z² ≈ 3.08.\n\nz³ ≈ z² * z ≈ 3.08 * 1.755 ≈ 5.40.\n\nz^4 ≈ z³ * z ≈ 5.40 * 1.755 ≈ 9.477.\n\nz^5 ≈ z^4 * z ≈ 9.477 * 1.755 ≈ approx 9.477 * 1.75 ≈ 16.53, plus 9.477 * 0.005 ≈ 0.047, total ≈ 16.58.\n\nz^6 ≈ z^5 * z ≈ 16.58 * 1.755 ≈ approx 16.58 * 1.75 ≈ 28. 16.58 * 0.005 ≈ 0.08, total ≈ 28.08.\n\nTherefore:\n\nP(z) ≈ 28.08 - 16.58 - 5.40 - 3.08 - 1.755 ≈ \n\n28.08 - 16.58 = 11.5; \n\n11.5 - 5.40 = 6.1; \n\n6.1 - 3.08 = 3.02; \n\n3.02 - 1.755 ≈ 1.265.\n\nBut according to our formula, it should be ≈ 2.325. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that either my approximations are too rough, or there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Hmm. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, first, my approximate value for z is 1.755, and according to Q(z) = 0, z^4 = z³ + z² + 1. Let me check with z ≈ 1.755:\n\nEarlier approximated z^4 ≈ 9.477.\n\nz³ + z² + 1 ≈ 5.40 + 3.08 + 1 ≈ 9.48. Which matches z^4 ≈ 9.477. So that seems okay.\n\nNow, according to our formula, P(z) should be z² - z + 1 ≈ 3.08 - 1.755 + 1 ≈ 2.325. However, when I calculated P(z) ≈ 28.08 - 16.58 - 5.40 - 3.08 - 1.755 ≈ 1.265. There's a discrepancy here. Which means that either my approximate calculation is wrong, or my formula is wrong. \n\nWait, let me recalculate P(z). Maybe my approximated values for z^5 and z^6 are incorrect.\n\nGiven z ≈ 1.755, let me compute z^4 = z³ + z² + 1 ≈ 5.4 + 3.08 + 1 = 9.48. Then z^5 = z * z^4 ≈ 1.755 * 9.48 ≈ Let me compute 1.755 * 9.48:\n\nFirst, 1.755 * 9 = 15.795, 1.755 * 0.48 ≈ 0.8424. Total ≈ 15.795 + 0.8424 ≈ 16.6374. So z^5 ≈ 16.64.\n\nz^6 = z * z^5 ≈ 1.755 * 16.64 ≈ Let me compute 1.755 * 16 = 28.08, 1.755 * 0.64 ≈ 1.1232. Total ≈ 28.08 + 1.1232 ≈ 29.2032.\n\nTherefore P(z) = z^6 - z^5 - z³ - z² - z ≈ 29.20 - 16.64 - 5.4 - 3.08 - 1.755 ≈ \n\n29.20 - 16.64 = 12.56\n\n12.56 - 5.4 = 7.16\n\n7.16 - 3.08 = 4.08\n\n4.08 - 1.755 ≈ 2.325. \n\nAh! So my previous calculation of z^6 was wrong. Earlier I thought z^6 ≈ 28.08, but actually it's ≈ 29.20. Then 29.20 - 16.64 is 12.56... and so on, leading to ≈ 2.325, which matches the formula z² - z + 1 ≈ 2.325. Therefore, my initial calculation had an error in approximating z^6. Therefore, the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, this numerical check supports that P(z) = z² - z + 1. Therefore, the sum is indeed 3 - 1 + 4 = 6. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{6}\n</think>"}
