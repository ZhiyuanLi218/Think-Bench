Let me start by recalling some basics about polygons and arithmetic sequences.\n\nFirst, for any convex polygon with n sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula (n - 2) * 180 degrees. Since this is an 18-sided polygon, the sum should be (18 - 2) * 180 = 16 * 180. Let me calculate that: 16 * 180. Well, 10*180 is 1800, 6*180 is 1080, so total is 1800 + 1080 = 2880 degrees. So the sum of all interior angles is 2880 degrees.\n\nNow, the angles form an arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive terms. Let me denote the smallest angle as 'a' and the common difference as 'd'. Since it's an increasing sequence, d must be a positive integer. Also, since the polygon is convex, each interior angle must be less than 180 degrees. That's important because in a convex polygon, all angles are less than 180. So each angle in the sequence must satisfy that condition.\n\nSince there are 18 angles, the angles can be written as:\na, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + 17d.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). In this case, the number of terms is 18, the first term is 'a', and the last term is 'a + 17d'. Therefore, the sum is 18/2 * (a + (a + 17d)) = 9*(2a + 17d). And we know that this sum equals 2880 degrees.\n\nSo, 9*(2a + 17d) = 2880. Let me write that equation down:\n\n9*(2a + 17d) = 2880\n\nDividing both sides by 9:\n\n2a + 17d = 2880 / 9\n\nLet me compute 2880 divided by 9. Well, 9*320 = 2880, right? Because 9*300 = 2700, and 9*20 = 180, so 2700 + 180 = 2880. So 2880 / 9 = 320. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n2a + 17d = 320.\n\nSo now I have one equation with two variables, a and d. But we need another condition to solve for both. The other condition is that all angles must be less than 180 degrees. Since the sequence is increasing, the largest angle will be the one that's most likely to exceed 180 degrees. Therefore, the largest angle is a + 17d < 180.\n\nSo, we have two inequalities:\n\n1. a + 17d < 180\n2. Also, since the polygon is convex, all angles must be greater than 0, but since it's increasing, the smallest angle a must be positive. However, since d is positive, and a is positive, the main constraint is the upper bound on the largest angle.\n\nSo, let me write down:\n\na + 17d < 180.\n\nAdditionally, since angles are integer values, both a and d must be integers. Also, since the sequence is increasing, d must be at least 1.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to solving the equation 2a + 17d = 320 with the constraint that a + 17d < 180, and a and d are positive integers.\n\nLet me try to express a in terms of d from the equation 2a + 17d = 320. Solving for a:\n\n2a = 320 - 17d\n\nTherefore,\n\na = (320 - 17d)/2\n\nSince a must be an integer, (320 - 17d) must be even. Let's check the parity. 17d must have the same parity as 320. Since 320 is even, 17d must be even. Since 17 is odd, d must be even. Therefore, d must be an even integer. So d is a positive even integer.\n\nSo d is even, let me denote d = 2k, where k is a positive integer. Then substituting into the equation:\n\na = (320 - 17*(2k))/2 = (320 - 34k)/2 = 160 - 17k.\n\nTherefore, a = 160 - 17k.\n\nBut also, we have the inequality from the largest angle:\n\na + 17d < 180.\n\nSubstituting a and d:\n\n(160 - 17k) + 17*(2k) < 180.\n\nSimplify:\n\n160 -17k + 34k < 180\n\nWhich is:\n\n160 + 17k < 180\n\nSubtract 160:\n\n17k < 20\n\nTherefore, k < 20/17 ≈ 1.176.\n\nSince k is a positive integer, the only possible value is k = 1.\n\nTherefore, k = 1. Then d = 2k = 2*1 = 2.\n\nThen, a = 160 - 17k = 160 - 17*1 = 160 - 17 = 143.\n\nSo, the smallest angle is 143 degrees. Let me check if this satisfies all the conditions.\n\nFirst, let's check the sum. The angles would be an arithmetic sequence starting at 143, with common difference 2, for 18 terms.\n\nSum is 18/2*(first + last) = 9*(143 + (143 + 17*2)).\n\nCalculate last term: 143 + 34 = 177.\n\nSo sum is 9*(143 + 177) = 9*(320) = 2880. Which matches the required sum. Good.\n\nNow check if all angles are less than 180. The largest angle is 177, which is less than 180. Also, since it's convex, all angles are less than 180. Also, angles are increasing, so the rest are smaller. Also, check that all angles are positive. The smallest angle is 143, which is positive. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, is there another possible value of k? Let me check. Earlier, we had k < 20/17 ≈ 1.176. Since k is a positive integer, the only possible value is k=1. If k=0, then d=0, but that would make all angles equal, but the problem says it's an increasing sequence, so d must be positive. Hence, k cannot be zero. Therefore, only k=1 is possible. Therefore, the only solution is a=143, d=2. Therefore, the smallest angle is 143 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other possibilities. Suppose I didn't make the substitution with k. Let me check again.\n\nWe had from 17k < 20, k must be less than 20/17. Since k is integer, k=1 is the only possible. So yes, that's the only solution. Therefore, the answer is 143 degrees. Let me check again if the angles are all integers. Since a=143, d=2. Each angle is 143 + 2(n-1) for n from 1 to 18. All terms will be integers because 143 is integer and 2*(n-1) is integer. So yes, all angles are integers. Also, the sequence is increasing. All conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another approach where maybe d is not even? Wait, earlier we said that since 2a + 17d = 320, which is even, and 17d must be even because 2a is even. Since 17 is odd, d must be even. Therefore, d must be even. Therefore, there are no solutions with odd d. Therefore, our previous conclusion is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if maybe there's a case where even though k is not integer, but maybe there are other constraints? Wait, no. Because we derived that k must be less than 1.176, so only k=1. Therefore, only one solution. Therefore, the measure of the smallest angle is 143 degrees. Therefore, I think that is the answer.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me suppose that the average angle is 2880 / 18 = 160 degrees. Since the average of the arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and last term. Which is (a + (a + 17d))/2 = a + 8.5d. Which should be equal to 160. Therefore:\n\na + 8.5d = 160.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2a + 17d = 320. Which is the same equation as before. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo if we think about it, the middle of the arithmetic sequence, since there are 18 terms (even number), there isn't a single middle term. The average is between the 9th and 10th term. The 9th term is a + 8d, and the 10th term is a + 9d. The average of those two is (a + 8d + a + 9d)/2 = a + 8.5d, which is 160. So that's consistent.\n\nBut perhaps this helps us think differently. For example, since the average is 160, and the sequence is symmetric around this average. Since there are 18 terms, the 9th and 10th terms are around the average. However, since the sequence is increasing, each term increases by d. So, the 9th term is a + 8d, and the 10th term is a + 9d. The average of these two is 160. So, we can also think about how far the largest term is from the average.\n\nThe largest term is a + 17d. The difference between the largest term and the average is (a + 17d) - 160 = (a + 8.5d) + 8.5d - 160 = 0 + 8.5d = 8.5d. Wait, no, since a + 8.5d = 160, so the largest term is 160 + 8.5d. Wait, but we also know that the largest term must be less than 180. Therefore:\n\n160 + 8.5d < 180 => 8.5d < 20 => d < 20 / 8.5 ≈ 2.3529.\n\nSince d is a positive even integer (as established earlier), possible values of d are 2. Because 8.5d < 20. If d=2, 8.5*2=17 < 20. If d=4, 8.5*4=34 > 20. Therefore, only d=2 is possible. Therefore, d=2. Then from the average equation:\n\na + 8.5*2 = 160 => a + 17 = 160 => a = 143. Same result. Therefore, this confirms the previous conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the smallest angle is 143 degrees. Therefore, I think that is the answer.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me check if there are other constraints. For example, the smallest angle must be greater than some value? Well, since the polygon is convex, each angle must be less than 180, but there's no strict lower bound except that they must be positive and the polygon must be convex. However, since the sequence is increasing, if we have a common difference, we need to make sure that all angles are greater than 0. However, since the smallest angle is 143, which is way above 0, that's not a problem. But if d were larger, maybe we could have a problem? But in our case, d is fixed at 2, so all angles are 143, 145,...,177. All are between 143 and 177, which are all greater than 0 and less than 180. So that's good.\n\nIs there any other possible value? Suppose someone thought maybe d could be a fraction? But the problem says integer values. The angles must have integer measures. Since a and d must be integers, as the problem says \"integer values\". Therefore, d must be integer. Therefore, our previous reasoning holds.\n\nAlternatively, if someone tried to use another approach, maybe trial and error? For example, knowing that the average is 160, and trying to build the sequence around that. But since we already have a solution, and the constraints limit d to only one possible value, I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 143 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe degree measure of the smallest angle is \\boxed{143}.\n</think>"}
