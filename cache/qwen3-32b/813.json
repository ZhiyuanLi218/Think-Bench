So we have four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. The question is about which of the options A to D is correct regarding whether they are quantum states or their properties related to the Bloch sphere. \n\nFirst, I need to remember what a valid quantum state (density matrix) must satisfy. A density matrix must be Hermitian, have trace 1, and be positive semi-definite. So for each matrix, I should check these three conditions.\n\nStarting with matrix W:\nW = [[1/2, i/4], [-i/4, 1/2]]\n\nFirst, check if it's Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of W should be equal to W. The (1,2) entry is i/4, its conjugate is -i/4, which is the (2,1) entry. So yes, it's Hermitian. The trace is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which is good. Now, positive semi-definite. For a 2x2 matrix, one way to check is that the determinant is non-negative. The determinant of W is (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 - (i^2)/16. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 1/4 - (-1)/16 = 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16, which is positive. So W is positive semi-definite. Therefore, W is a valid density matrix, hence a quantum state.\n\nNext, matrix X:\nX = [[1/3, 1], [1, 2/3]]\n\nCheck Hermitian: The (1,2) entry is 1, conjugate transpose would be same since it's real. So Hermitian. Trace is 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good. Now determinant: (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Negative determinant. That's a problem. For a positive semi-definite matrix, determinant must be non-negative. So X is not positive semi-definite. Therefore, X is not a valid density matrix. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here? Let me recalculate. (1/3)(2/3) is 2/9, and 1*1 is 1. So determinant is 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Yes, negative. So X is not a valid quantum state.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"choose the correct option\" and option A says W, X, and Z are quantum states. But if X is not a valid quantum state, then A is incorrect. So maybe I need to check others.\n\nMatrix Y:\nY = [[1/2, i/3], [-i/3, 1/2]]\n\nSame as W but with i/3 instead of i/4. Check Hermitian: Conjugate of (1,2) entry is -i/3, which is the (2,1) entry. So yes. Trace is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Determinant is (1/2)(1/2) - (i/3)(-i/3) = 1/4 - (i^2)/9 = 1/4 - (-1)/9 = 1/4 + 1/9 = 13/36 ≈ 0.361, positive. So Y is a valid density matrix. Therefore Y is a quantum state. But the options don't mention Y in A. Wait, option B says \"Y lies inside the Bloch sphere\". Hmm. Let's come back to that.\n\nMatrix Z:\nZ = [[2/3, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3]]\n\nCheck Hermitian: entries are real, so yes. Trace is 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Good. Determinant is (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)^2 = 2/9 - 1/16 = (32 - 9)/144 = 23/144 ≈ 0.1597, positive. So Z is positive semi-definite. Therefore Z is a valid density matrix. So Z is a quantum state. \n\nSo so far, W, Y, Z are valid quantum states. X is not. Therefore, option A says W, X, Z are quantum states. But X is not, so A is incorrect. \n\nOption B: Y lies inside the Bloch sphere. \n\nWait, the Bloch sphere is for qubit states. Any valid density matrix for a qubit lies on or inside the Bloch sphere. Pure states lie on the surface (radius 1), mixed states are inside (radius less than 1). So for a density matrix, the Bloch vector's length squared is given by Tr(ρ²) - 1/2. Wait, no, more precisely, for a qubit, the density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. The length of r is |r| = sqrt(Tr(ρ²)*2 - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula.\n\nAlternatively, for a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector r is such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Then Tr(ρ²) = (Tr(I²) + 2 r·σ Tr(ρ) + (r·σ)^2)/4. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the Frobenius norm or something else. Alternatively, for a qubit, the maximum length of the Bloch vector is 1 (for pure states). For mixed states, it's less than 1.\n\nSo for any valid density matrix, the Bloch vector must have length ≤1. So Y is a valid density matrix (as we saw), so it lies inside or on the Bloch sphere. But the question is whether it lies inside. If it's a mixed state, then yes. If it's pure, then on the surface. So need to check if Y is pure or mixed. \n\nA pure state has Tr(ρ²) = 1. Let's compute Tr(Y²). For Y, which is [[1/2, i/3], [-i/3, 1/2]], compute Y squared:\n\nY² = [[(1/2)^2 + (i/3)(-i/3), (1/2)(i/3) + (i/3)(1/2)], [(1/2)(-i/3) + (-i/3)(1/2), (-i/3)(i/3) + (1/2)^2]]\n\nCalculating entries:\n\nFirst entry: 1/4 + (i * -i)/9 = 1/4 + ( -i²)/9 = 1/4 + 1/9 = 13/36.\n\nSecond entry (off-diagonal): (i/6 + i/6) = i/3. Wait, let me compute again:\n\nFirst row, second column: (1/2)(i/3) + (i/3)(1/2) = i/6 + i/6 = i/3.\n\nSimilarly, the other off-diagonal entry is -i/3.\n\nDiagonal entries are same as first entry, so Y² = [[13/36, i/3], [-i/3, 13/36]]\n\nThen trace of Y² is 13/36 + 13/36 = 26/36 = 13/18 ≈ 0.722. Since this is less than 1, Y is a mixed state, so its Bloch vector has length less than 1, meaning it's inside the Bloch sphere. Therefore option B is correct? Wait, but the question is whether Y lies inside the Bloch sphere. Since Y is a valid quantum state (mixed), yes, it's inside. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. \n\nTo check this, need to find the Bloch vector components for Z. Let me recall that for a density matrix ρ, we can write it as ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. The components r_x, r_y, r_z can be found by taking the trace of ρ with the Pauli matrices. Specifically, r_x = Tr(ρ σ_x), r_y = Tr(ρ σ_y), r_z = Tr(ρ σ_z).\n\nSo let's compute for Z = [[2/3, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3]]\n\nFirst compute r_x = Tr(Z σ_x). σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So Z σ_x is [[2/3*0 + 1/4*1, 2/3*1 + 1/4*0], [1/4*0 + 1/3*1, 1/4*1 + 1/3*0]] = [[1/4, 2/3], [1/3, 1/4]]. Then Tr(Z σ_x) is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Therefore r_x = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, r_y = Tr(Z σ_y). σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Compute Z σ_y:\n\nFirst row: [2/3*0 + 1/4*(-i), 2/3*(-i) + 1/4*0] = [-i/4, -2i/3]\n\nSecond row: [1/4*0 + 1/3*(-i), 1/4*(-i) + 1/3*0] = [-i/3, -i/4]\n\nThen Tr(Z σ_y) is (-i/4) + (-i/4) = -i/2. Wait, but trace should be a real number. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute Z σ_y properly.\n\nWait, matrix multiplication: Z is [[2/3, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3]], σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So multiplying Z and σ_y:\n\nFirst row, first column: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = i/4\n\nFirst row, second column: (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = -2i/3\n\nSecond row, first column: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3\n\nSecond row, second column: (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = -i/4\n\nSo Z σ_y is [[i/4, -2i/3], [i/3, -i/4]]\n\nNow take the trace: i/4 + (-i/4) = 0. Therefore r_y = Tr(Z σ_y) = 0. Wait, so r_y is zero? But then component y is zero. So the Bloch vector for Z has components (r_x, r_y, r_z). We found r_x = 1/2, r_y = 0. Let me compute r_z.\n\nr_z = Tr(Z σ_z). σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So Z σ_z is [[2/3*1 + 1/4*0, 2/3*0 + 1/4*(-1)], [1/4*1 + 1/3*0, 1/4*0 + 1/3*(-1)]] = [[2/3, -1/4], [1/4, -1/3]]. The trace is 2/3 + (-1/3) = 1/3. Therefore r_z = 1/3.\n\nSo the Bloch vector is (1/2, 0, 1/3). Therefore, the y-component is zero. Therefore, not every component is nonzero. So option C is incorrect because the y-component is zero. Therefore, option C is false.\n\nOption D: At least one of the states is pure.\n\nA pure state has Tr(ρ²) = 1. Let's check for W, Y, Z. We already computed Tr(Y²) = 13/18 ≈ 0.722 < 1, so mixed. For Z, let's compute Tr(Z²). Z is [[2/3, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3]]\n\nZ² = [[(2/3)(2/3) + (1/4)(1/4), (2/3)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/3)], [(1/4)(2/3) + (1/3)(1/4), (1/4)(1/4) + (1/3)(1/3)]]\n\nCalculating entries:\n\nFirst entry: 4/9 + 1/16 = (64 + 9)/144 = 73/144\n\nSecond entry: 2/12 + 1/12 = 3/12 = 1/4. Wait, let me compute again:\n\nFirst row, second column: (2/3)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/3) = 2/(12) + 1/(12) = 3/12 = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, second row, first column is same as first row second column: 1/4.\n\nSecond diagonal entry: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/3)(1/3) = 1/16 + 1/9 = (9 + 16)/144 = 25/144.\n\nSo Z² = [[73/144, 1/4], [1/4, 25/144]]\n\nTrace of Z² is 73/144 + 25/144 = 98/144 = 49/72 ≈ 0.68 < 1. So Z is mixed.\n\nNow check W. W is [[1/2, i/4], [-i/4, 1/2]]. Compute W²:\n\nW² = [[(1/2)^2 + (i/4)(-i/4), (1/2)(i/4) + (i/4)(1/2)], [(1/2)(-i/4) + (-i/4)(1/2), (-i/4)(i/4) + (1/2)^2]]\n\nFirst entry: 1/4 + ( -i²)/16 = 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16.\n\nSecond entry: i/8 + i/8 = i/4.\n\nSimilarly, other entries. The diagonal entries are same, so trace is 5/16 + 5/16 = 10/16 = 5/8 = 0.625 < 1. So W is also mixed. \n\nSo all three valid states (W, Y, Z) are mixed. Therefore, none of them are pure. So option D says \"At least one of the states is pure.\" But if all are mixed, then D is incorrect. Wait, but maybe I missed something? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question says \"at least one of the states is pure.\" But according to our analysis, W, Y, Z are all mixed. X is not a valid state. So D is incorrect. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Tr(W²)?\n\nLet me recalculate Tr(W²). W is [[1/2, i/4], [-i/4, 1/2]]. So W squared:\n\nFirst entry (top-left): (1/2)(1/2) + (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 + (-i²)/16 = 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16. Correct. Similarly, the other diagonal entry is same. So trace is 5/8. Which is less than 1. So W is mixed. Similarly for Y and Z. Therefore, none of the valid states (W, Y, Z) are pure. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nSo options: A is incorrect because X is not a valid state. B is correct because Y is a mixed state, so inside the Bloch sphere. C is incorrect because Y's Bloch vector has a zero component. D is incorrect because none are pure. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check again for option D. The problem says \"at least one of the states is pure.\" The states in question are W, X, Y, Z. But X is not a valid state. So only W, Y, Z are valid states. If none of them are pure, then D is incorrect. So yes, D is incorrect. So only B is correct. Therefore, answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
