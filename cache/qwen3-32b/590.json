{"question":"Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods.

The problem gives me some information about the star and the two planets, and mentions that they use both transit and radial velocity methods. The key here is probably relating the radial velocity data to the orbital parameters, which then can be used to find the equilibrium temperatures.\n\nFirst, let me recall what equilibrium temperature is. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a black body in thermal equilibrium with the radiation from its star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^{1/4}\n\nWhere:\n- T_eq is the equilibrium temperature of the planet\n- T_star is the effective temperature of the star\n- R_star is the radius of the star\n- a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n- A is the albedo of the planet (reflectivity)\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) terms will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 will depend on the ratio of their orbital distances (a1/a2) and the star's radius and temperature.\n\nBut how do I find the semi-major axes of the planets? The problem gives me the radial velocity shifts induced by each planet. So I need to use the radial velocity method to find their orbital parameters.\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the gravitational pull of orbiting planets. The amplitude of the RV shift (K) is given by:\n\nK = (2π G)^{1/3} * (M_planet / M_star^{2/3}) / (P^{1/3}) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2))\n\nSince the orbits are circular, e = 0, so sqrt(1 - e^2) = 1. Also, the problem states both planets are in circular orbits. So the formula simplifies to:\n\nK = (2π G)^{1/3} * (M_planet / M_star^{2/3}) / P^{1/3}\n\nBut I need to relate this to the given Doppler shifts. The problem gives the maximum shift in wavelength (Δλ) for the [OI] line at 6300 Å. The Doppler shift formula is:\n\nΔλ / λ = v / c\n\nWhere v is the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSo from the given Δλ, I can find v, which is the RV semi-amplitude K. Let me check the numbers:\n\nFor Planet1: Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å\nSo Δλ1 / λ = 0.03 / 6300 = 4.7619 x 10^-6\n\nSimilarly for Planet2: Δλ2 = 0.04 Å, so Δλ2 / λ = 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.3492 x 10^-6\n\nTherefore, K1 = v1 = c * (Δλ1 / λ)\nSimilarly for K2.\n\nGiven c ≈ 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nCalculating K1:\n\nK1 = 3e8 m/s * (0.03 / 6300) ≈ 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1.4286e3 m/s ≈ 1428.6 m/s\n\nWait, that seems really high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 0.03 Å is 0.03 x 10^-10 meters (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m). But the Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So actually, the velocity v is c*(Δλ/λ). Let me compute that.\n\nBut let me compute it numerically:\n\nΔλ1/λ = 0.03 / 6300 = 4.7619 x 10^-6\n\nv1 = c * (Δλ1/λ) = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 3e8 * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s ≈ 1428 m/s\n\nSimilarly for v2: 0.04 / 6300 = 6.349e-6, so v2 ≈ 3e8 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1904.7 m/s\n\nWait, but these velocities are the K values for each planet. But the formula for K also depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. So if I can find the orbital periods, or relate them, I can find the semi-major axes via Kepler's third law.\n\nBut I need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes to compute the equilibrium temperature ratio.\n\nLet me write down the formula again for K:\n\nK = (2π G)^{1/3} * (M_p / M_star^{2/3}) / P^{1/3}\n\nBut since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same for both. Let me denote:\n\nK1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_star^{2/3}) / P1^{1/3} ] / [ (M_p2 / M_star^{2/3}) / P2^{1/3} ] = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore:\n\n(K1 / K2) = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nWe can solve for (P2 / P1):\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n(P2 / P1)^{1/3} = (K1 / K2) / (M_p1 / M_p2)\n\nTherefore:\n\n(P2 / P1) = [ (K1 / K2) / (M_p1 / M_p2) ]^3\n\nBut I need to compute this.\n\nGiven:\n\nM_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n\nM_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n\nK1 = 1428.6 m/s\n\nK2 = 1904.7 m/s\n\nSo K1/K2 ≈ 1428.6 / 1904.7 ≈ 0.75\n\nM_p1 / M_p2 = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\nTherefore:\n\n(P2 / P1) = [ 0.75 / 1.4 ]^3 ≈ [0.5357]^3 ≈ 0.1535\n\nWait, so P2 / P1 ≈ 0.1535? That would mean P2 is much shorter than P1, implying that Planet2 is closer to the star. Which makes sense if its radial velocity amplitude is higher (since K is higher for a closer planet, assuming similar masses). But let me check if I did the algebra right.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nK ∝ M_p / P^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nSo rearranged:\n\n(P2 / P1)^{1/3} = (K1 / K2) / (M_p1 / M_p2)\n\nTherefore, (P2 / P1) = [ (K1 / K2) / (M_p1 / M_p2) ]^3\n\nYes, that's correct. So substituting the numbers:\n\nK1/K2 ≈ 0.75\n\nM_p1/M_p2 = 1.4\n\nTherefore, the ratio inside the brackets is 0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357\n\nSo (P2 / P1) ≈ (0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.1535\n\nTherefore, P2 ≈ 0.1535 * P1\n\nSo the orbital period of Planet2 is about 15% of that of Planet1.\n\nNow, using Kepler's third law to relate orbital period and semi-major axis.\n\nKepler's third law states:\n\nP^2 = (4π²/GM_star) * a^3\n\nBut for our purposes, since we are dealing with ratios, and since both planets orbit the same star, we can write:\n\n(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3\n\nTherefore:\n\n(a2 / a1)^3 = (P2 / P1)^2\n\nTherefore:\n\na2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^{2/3}\n\nFrom earlier, P2 / P1 ≈ 0.1535\n\nTherefore:\n\na2 / a1 = (0.1535)^{2/3}\n\nLet me compute that. Let's take natural logs to make it easier.\n\nln(0.1535) ≈ -1.874\n\nMultiply by 2/3: -1.874 * 2/3 ≈ -1.249\n\nExponentiate: e^{-1.249} ≈ 0.286\n\nAlternatively, using decimal approximations:\n\nLet me compute 0.1535^(2/3). Let me note that 0.1535 is approximately (0.1535). Let me compute 0.1535^(1/3) first, then square it.\n\nCube root of 0.1535: Let's see. 0.1535 is between 0.125 (which is 0.5^3) and 0.216 (which is 0.6^3). Let me estimate.\n\n0.5^3 = 0.125\n\n0.55^3 = 0.166375\n\n0.54^3 = 0.54 * 0.54 * 0.54 = 0.2916 * 0.54 ≈ 0.1575\n\nSo 0.54^3 ≈ 0.1575, which is slightly higher than 0.1535. Let's say cube root of 0.1535 is approximately 0.535.\n\nThen squaring that: 0.535^2 ≈ 0.286. So yes, a2/a1 ≈ 0.286. Therefore, a2 ≈ 0.286 * a1.\n\nSo the semi-major axis of Planet2 is about 28.6% of Planet1's semi-major axis. Therefore, Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature formula is:\n\nT_eq ∝ sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, R_star is the same for both, so T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\nTherefore, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) ] / [ T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) ] = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nYes, because sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nTherefore, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(0.286) ≈ 0.535\n\nWait, so the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 divided by that of Planet2 is approximately 0.535, meaning that Planet2 is hotter than Planet1. Therefore, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.535, which is approximately 0.53, which is option D: ~0.53.\n\nBut wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, K1 and K2 were calculated correctly? Let me verify.\n\nΔλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å.\n\nΔλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300 = 4.7619e-6.\n\nv = c * Δλ/λ = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1.4286e3 m/s ≈ 1428.6 m/s. Correct.\n\nSame for Δλ2 = 0.04 / 6300 = 6.349e-6, so v ≈ 3e8 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1904.7 m/s. Correct.\n\nThen K1/K2 ≈ 1428.6 / 1904.7 ≈ 0.75. Correct.\n\nM_p1 / M_p2 = 7 / 5 = 1.4. Correct.\n\nThen (P2 / P1) = [ (K1 / K2) / (M_p1 / M_p2) ]^3 = (0.75 / 1.4)^3 ≈ (0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.1535. Correct.\n\nThen a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^{2/3} ≈ 0.1535^{2/3} ≈ 0.286. Correct.\n\nThen T_eq ratio: T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) ≈ sqrt(0.286) ≈ 0.535. So the ratio of T1 to T2 is ~0.53, so answer D.\n\nBut let me check the formula for equilibrium temperature again. The formula I used is T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). Is that correct?\n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 a))^{1/2} * (1 - A)^{1/4}\n\nAssuming same albedo, so (1 - A) is same, so yes, T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star / a). Since R_star is same for both planets, T_eq is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a). Therefore, T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1). Which is sqrt(0.286) ≈ 0.535. So the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if there's a mistake in the relation between K and the orbital parameters. The formula I used for K was:\n\nK = (2π G)^{1/3} * (M_p / M_star^{2/3}) / P^{1/3}\n\nBut actually, the correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (2π G)^{1/3} * (M_p / M_star^{2/3}) / sqrt(1 - e^2) * (1 / P^{1/3})\n\nWhich for circular orbits (e=0) simplifies to:\n\nK = (2π G)^{1/3} * (M_p / M_star^{2/3}) / P^{1/3}\n\nBut since both planets are orbiting the same star, and we are taking a ratio of K1 and K2, the constants (2π G)^{1/3} and M_star^{2/3} would cancel out in the ratio. Therefore, the ratio K1/K2 is indeed (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1)^{1/3}, which is what I used. Therefore, the steps are correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: units. The masses of the planets are given in Earth masses. However, in the formula for K, the masses should be in the same units as the star's mass. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses. The planets are 7 and 5 Earth masses. Since Earth mass is much smaller than solar mass (1 M_sun ≈ 333,000 M_earth), the M_p / M_star^2/3 term would be in terms of solar masses? Wait, but since we are taking ratios, the actual units may not matter as long as they are consistent.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we write the formula for K as:\n\nK ∝ M_p / (M_star^{2/3} * P^{1/3})\n\nBut since M_p is in Earth masses and M_star is in solar masses, when taking the ratio K1/K2, the constants of proportionality would cancel, and we can just use the given mass ratios. Because if both planets are orbiting the same star, then M_star is same for both, so when taking the ratio, M_star terms cancel. Therefore, even though the actual value of K would depend on the actual masses and G, etc., in the ratio K1/K2, those constants cancel. Therefore, the calculation is okay.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1 / T2 is approximately 0.53, which is option D.\n\nBut let me check if I mixed up the ratio. The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, so T1 / T2. Since a2 is smaller than a1, Planet2 is closer, so T2 should be higher than T1. Therefore, T1 / T2 should be less than 1, which matches 0.53. The options are:\n\nA: ~1.05\n\nB: ~0.98\n\nC: ~1.30\n\nD: ~0.53\n\nSo answer D.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a mistake in the formula for the equilibrium temperature. Some sources say the formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 a))^{1/2} * (1 - A)^{1/4}\n\nBut others might use different factors depending on the assumptions (like whether it's assuming spherical vs flat disk, or whether the planet is tidally locked, etc). However, the standard formula usually has a factor of 1/sqrt(2) or similar. Let me verify.\n\nThe derivation of equilibrium temperature starts with the energy balance. The power received from the star is:\n\nL_star * π R_p^2 / (4 π a^2) = L_star * R_p^2 / (4 a^2)\n\nAssuming the planet is a black body, it emits power:\n\n4 π R_p^2 σ T_eq^4\n\nSetting them equal (assuming all absorbed energy is re-emitted):\n\nL_star * R_p^2 / (4 a^2) * (1 - A) = 4 π R_p^2 σ T_eq^4\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_star / (4 a^2) * (1 - A) = 4 π σ T_eq^4\n\nSolving for T_eq:\n\nT_eq^4 = L_star (1 - A) / (16 π σ a^2)\n\nBut L_star = 4 π σ R_star^2 T_star^4 (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law). Substitute:\n\nT_eq^4 = [4 π σ R_star^2 T_star^4 * (1 - A)] / (16 π σ a^2) ) = [R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - A)] / (4 a^2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (1 - A)^{1/4}\n\nYes, that's the same formula I used. Therefore, T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star / a). Since R_star is same for both planets, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). Therefore, T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1). Which is sqrt(0.286) ≈ 0.535. So answer D.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: ~0.53.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
