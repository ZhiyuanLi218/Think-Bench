Let me go through each option one by one. \n\nStarting with option (A): The number of neutrons in 1.8 g of ¹⁸O is N_A. \n\nFirst, I remember that Avogadro's number is 6.022×10²³ particles per mole. So, I need to calculate the number of neutrons in 1.8 grams of oxygen-18. \n\nOxygen-18 has an atomic mass of 18, so its molar mass is 18 g/mol. Let me check: the molar mass of ¹⁸O is indeed 18 g/mol. \n\nSo, 1.8 g of ¹⁸O would be 1.8 g divided by 18 g/mol, which is 0.1 mol. \n\nNow, each oxygen-18 nucleus has 8 protons (since oxygen has atomic number 8) and 18 - 8 = 10 neutrons. \n\nSo, each atom of ¹⁸O has 10 neutrons. Therefore, the number of neutrons in 0.1 mol of ¹⁸O would be 0.1 mol × 10 neutrons/atom × N_A. \n\nCalculating that: 0.1 × 10 = 1, so 1 × N_A. \n\nSo option (A) says the number of neutrons is N_A, which matches my calculation. So (A) seems correct. \n\nWait, let me check again. 1.8 grams divided by 18 g/mol is 0.1 mol. Each mole of ¹⁸O has Avogadro's number of atoms. Each atom has 10 neutrons. So total neutrons is 0.1 × N_A × 10 = 1 × N_A. Yes, that's right. So (A) is correct. \n\nMoving on to option (B): The number of σ bonds in 28 g of C₂H₄ molecules is 4 N_A. \n\nC₂H₄ is ethylene. Let me recall the structure of ethylene. Each molecule has a double bond between the two carbon atoms, which consists of one σ bond and one π bond. Each carbon also forms single bonds with two hydrogen atoms. \n\nSo, in one molecule of C₂H₄, each carbon is bonded to two hydrogens and the other carbon. Let me count the σ bonds. \n\nEach single bond is a σ bond, and the double bond has one σ and one π. \n\nSo for ethylene, there are:\n\n- 1 σ bond between the two carbons.\n\n- Each carbon is bonded to two hydrogens, so 2 × 2 = 4 C-H σ bonds? Wait, no. Each carbon is bonded to two hydrogens, so each molecule has 2 + 2 = 4 C-H bonds. \n\nTherefore, total σ bonds per molecule: 1 (C-C σ) + 4 (C-H σ) = 5 σ bonds. \n\nNow, how many moles of C₂H₄ is 28 g? The molar mass of C₂H₄ is (2×12) + (4×1) = 24 + 4 = 28 g/mol. \n\nSo 28 g is 1 mole of C₂H₄. \n\nTherefore, number of σ bonds is 5 × N_A. But the option (B) says 4 N_A. That would be incorrect. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the σ bonds? Let me check again.\n\nEthylene structure: H2C=CH2. Each carbon has three σ bonds: one to each hydrogen and one to the other carbon. Wait, each carbon in ethylene is bonded to two hydrogens and one carbon. But each carbon has three σ bonds? Because the double bond is one σ and one π. So each carbon has three σ bonds. Since there are two carbons, but the C-C σ bond is shared between them. \n\nTotal σ bonds: Each molecule has 5 σ bonds. Let me think: \n\nEach C-H bond is σ. There are 4 C-H bonds. The C-C bond is σ. So total 5 σ bonds. \n\nYes, that's right. So 1 mole of C₂H₄ has 5 N_A σ bonds. Therefore, option (B) says 4 N_A, which is wrong. So (B) is incorrect. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another way. \n\nIn general, in organic molecules, the number of σ bonds can be calculated as follows: each single bond is one σ bond, each double bond has one σ and one π, triple has one σ and two π. \n\nSo for ethylene, which has one double bond and four single bonds (the C-H bonds). Wait, the double bond is between the two carbons. Then each carbon is bonded to two hydrogens. So there are four C-H single bonds and one C-C double bond. \n\nTherefore, total σ bonds: 4 (from C-H) + 1 (from C-C σ) = 5. So yes, 5 σ bonds per molecule. \n\nSo 1 mole of C₂H₄ would have 5 N_A σ bonds. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect. So (B) is not correct. \n\nMoving on to option (C): Under standard conditions, the number of H⁺ in 22.4 L HCl gas is N_A. \n\nStandard conditions are usually 0°C and 1 atm. At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L. \n\nSo 22.4 L of HCl gas at STP would be 1 mole of HCl molecules. \n\nBut the question is about the number of H⁺ ions. Now, HCl is a gas. If it's just HCl gas, not dissolved in water, then HCl molecules are not dissociated into H⁺ and Cl⁻. In the gas phase, HCl exists as molecules. \n\nHowever, the question says \"the number of H⁺ in 22.4 L HCl gas\". Wait, if HCl is in gas form, then there are no H⁺ ions, unless it's dissolved in water. \n\nBut the question doesn't mention dissolving it in water. So if we just have HCl gas, then the H is bonded to Cl as molecules. Therefore, there are no H⁺ ions. \n\nTherefore, the number of H⁺ ions would be zero? But the option says it's N_A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If they consider that each HCl molecule has one H atom, and if they count H atoms as H⁺, that would be wrong. \n\nBut H⁺ is a proton. Unless the HCl is ionized, which it isn't in the gas phase. \n\nTherefore, the statement (C) is incorrect. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is assuming that HCl gas is dissolved in water? But the question says \"HCl gas\", not \"HCl solution\". \n\nSo unless specified otherwise, we should assume that HCl is in gaseous state. Therefore, the number of H⁺ ions is zero. Therefore, (C) is incorrect. \n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, if they consider that each HCl molecule has one H atom, and if they are counting H atoms as H⁺, which they are not. So even if you have 1 mole of HCl gas, which has N_A molecules, each with one H atom, but H atoms are not H⁺ ions. \n\nTherefore, unless dissolved in water, HCl does not produce H⁺ ions. Therefore, (C) is incorrect. \n\nSo option (C) is wrong. \n\nNow option (D): The number of OH⁻ in Na₂CO₃ solution with pH=12 is 0.01 N_A. \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the volume of the solution. Wait, the question says \"the number of OH⁻...\", but how much solution are we talking about? \n\nWait, maybe the question is missing some information? Let me check again. \n\nThe original question says: \"The number of OH⁻ in Na₂CO₃ solution with pH=12 is 0.01 N_A\". \n\nWait, perhaps there's an implicit assumption about the volume? For example, if it's 1 liter? But the question doesn't specify. \n\nWait, maybe the original problem had more context? Wait, looking back: \n\nThe options are given as (D) The number of OH⁻ in Na₂CO₃ solution with pH=12 is 0.01 N_A. \n\nBut since the problem is presented as is, perhaps we need to assume that the volume is 1 liter? Maybe in Chinese exams, sometimes they assume 1L if not specified? Or maybe there was a typo or missing info here. \n\nWait, but given that the answer is supposed to be among the options, perhaps there's an assumption here. Let me think. \n\npH is 12. So pH = 12 implies that pOH = 14 - 12 = 2. Therefore, [OH⁻] = 10^(-pOH) = 10^(-2) = 0.01 M. \n\nIf the volume is 1 liter, then the number of moles of OH⁻ is 0.01 mol, which would be 0.01 N_A. \n\nBut the problem is that Na₂CO₃ is a base, and in solution, it hydrolyzes to produce OH⁻. However, the actual concentration of OH⁻ depends on the concentration of the Na₂CO₃ solution. However, the problem gives pH=12, so regardless of how it's produced, the [OH⁻] is 0.01 M. \n\nBut again, the number of OH⁻ ions depends on the volume of the solution. Since the problem doesn't specify the volume, how can we calculate the number? \n\nWait, maybe the original problem had a specific volume? For example, in some versions, maybe the volume is 1 liter? If that's the case, then the answer would be 0.01 N_A. \n\nBut since the problem as presented here does not specify the volume, is there an assumption? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is part of a problem set where previous information is given? But since it's presented here as standalone, perhaps there's an error. \n\nBut given that this is an exam question, and in such contexts, sometimes they assume 1 liter if not specified. For example, if you have a pH=12 solution, and they ask about the number of OH⁻ ions, they might be assuming 1 liter. \n\nIf that's the case, then [OH⁻] is 0.01 mol/L, so in 1 L, it's 0.01 mol, which is 0.01 N_A. Therefore, (D) would be correct. \n\nBut is there another factor? For example, in Na₂CO₃ solution, the OH⁻ comes from the hydrolysis of carbonate ions. However, the pH is given as 12, which directly relates to [OH⁻]. So regardless of how it's formed, if the pH is 12, then [OH⁻] is 0.01 M. \n\nTherefore, if we assume 1 liter of solution, then number of OH⁻ is 0.01 N_A. \n\nBut the problem is that the question doesn't specify the volume. However, in some textbooks or exams, when they mention a solution with a certain pH and ask about the number of ions, they might assume 1L. \n\nGiven that, perhaps (D) is correct. \n\nBut since the problem is presented here without volume, it's ambiguous. However, given that (D) is an option and the other options are (A), (B), (C) with some being correct, perhaps (D) is intended to be correct. \n\nBut wait, another thought: In a Na₂CO₃ solution, the OH⁻ ions are not only from the hydrolysis of carbonate but also... no, the OH⁻ comes from the hydrolysis. However, the pH is given, so regardless of the source, the concentration of OH⁻ is fixed. \n\nTherefore, if we assume 1L, then (D) is correct. \n\nBut the problem is that the question doesn't specify the volume. However, given that the answer is supposed to be one of the options, and (A) is correct, and maybe (D) is also correct? Let me check again. \n\nSo, if the volume is 1L, then yes. But if the volume is different, no. \n\nBut maybe in the original problem, there was a volume? For example, if the problem was part of a set where the volume is mentioned, but here it's missing. \n\nBut since in the given problem statement here, it's only stated as \"Na₂CO₃ solution with pH=12\", without volume, I can't be 100% sure. However, in many standardized problems, when they ask about the number of ions in a solution with a given pH, they usually assume 1L. \n\nTherefore, proceeding with that assumption, (D) is correct. \n\nBut let me check again. \n\nIf the solution is 1L, then [OH⁻] is 0.01 M, so moles of OH⁻ is 0.01 mol, which is 0.01 N_A. Therefore, (D) is correct. \n\nTherefore, possible correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check again if there are other factors. For example, in Na₂CO₃ solution, the OH⁻ concentration is due to hydrolysis. However, the pH is given, so the [OH⁻] is known. So regardless of the source, the number is determined by pH and volume. \n\nSo if the volume is 1L, then (D) is correct. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the volume, it's ambiguous. However, given the options, and that (D) is presented as such, I think the intended answer is that (D) is correct. \n\nSo summarizing:\n\n(A) Correct.\n\n(B) Incorrect, because there are 5 σ bonds per molecule.\n\n(C) Incorrect, because HCl gas doesn't dissociate into H+.\n\n(D) Correct, assuming 1L of solution.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"the number of OH⁻ in Na₂CO₃ solution with pH=12 is 0.01 N_A\". If the volume isn't given, how can we know? For example, if the volume is 0.1L, then it would be 0.001 N_A. \n\nBut maybe there's a standard volume? In Chinese exams, sometimes they assume 1L if not specified? For example, in problems where you have to calculate ions from concentration, they might assume 1L. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem originally had a volume mentioned, but it's missing here. However, given the options, I think (D) is intended to be correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me check the options again. \n\nOriginal options:\n\n(A) Correct.\n\n(B) Incorrect.\n\n(C) Incorrect.\n\n(D) Correct? \n\nBut let me check again. \n\nIf pH=12, then [H+]=1e-12, so [OH-]=1e-2 M. \n\nBut the number of OH⁻ ions depends on the volume. For example, if the volume is 1L, then yes, 0.01 mol. If the volume is different, no. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, is there any other way? \n\nWait, maybe the question is about the solution made from a certain amount of Na₂CO₃? For example, maybe the original problem had a specific amount? But since the user only provided the given statement, we have to go with what's given. \n\nIn the absence of volume, the answer can't be determined. However, in many textbook problems, when they ask about the number of ions in a solution with a given pH, they assume 1L. \n\nTherefore, given that, (D) is correct. \n\nThus, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut wait, looking back at the original question, the options are labeled (A), (B), (C), (D). The user is probably expecting multiple correct answers? Or is it a single correct answer? \n\nThe original question says \"the following statements are correct Option: (A)... etc.\" So it's possible that more than one is correct. \n\nBut let me check again. \n\nIn Chinese exams, sometimes options are multiple correct, but the way it's presented here is not clear. However, the user hasn't specified whether it's multiple correct or single. \n\nAssuming that it's multiple correct, and based on my analysis, (A) and (D) are correct. \n\nBut let me check again for (D). \n\nIf the solution is 1L, then yes. But suppose the solution is not 1L. However, since the problem gives pH=12, which is a concentration, but to get the number of ions, you need the amount. \n\nTherefore, the problem is incomplete. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the answer assumes 1L. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem had 1L mentioned, but in translation or formatting here, it's lost. \n\nGiven that, I think (D) is intended to be correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nWait, but let me check once more. \n\nFor (D): If the solution is 1L, then number of OH⁻ is 0.01 N_A. However, in reality, in a Na₂CO₃ solution, the OH⁻ concentration is due to hydrolysis. However, the pH is given as 12, so regardless of the source, the [OH⁻] is 0.01 M. So even if there's some other factors, the pH defines the [OH⁻]. \n\nTherefore, assuming 1L, (D) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other factors. For example, activity vs concentration, but at this level, we assume ideal solutions. \n\nTherefore, I think (A) and (D) are correct. \n\nBut let me check again for (A):\n\n1.8 g of ¹⁸O. Molar mass of ¹⁸O is 18 g/mol. 1.8 / 18 = 0.1 mol. Each atom has 10 neutrons. So total neutrons is 0.1 * 10 * N_A = 1 * N_A. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, (A) is correct. \n\nSo the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check again for (C). \n\nUnder standard conditions, 22.4 L of HCl gas is 1 mole. In gas phase, HCl is molecular. So H⁺ is not present unless dissolved. Therefore, number of H⁺ is zero. Hence, (C) is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut looking back at the original options, the user provided options (A) through (D), and the question is in Chinese style, which often has multiple correct answers. However, depending on the exam, sometimes only one is correct. \n\nBut according to my analysis, (A) and (D) are correct. \n\nBut let me check again for (D). \n\nIf the volume is not given, but the problem is from a textbook chapter where they assume 1L, then yes. However, if not, it's ambiguous. \n\nBut since the problem is presented as is, and given that pH is 12, and the answer is 0.01 N_A, which is 1e-2 N_A, that would correspond to 1e-2 mol in 1L. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer expects us to assume 1L. \n\nTherefore, (D) is correct. \n\nSo the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check again if there's any other mistake. \n\nFor (B): 28g of C₂H₄ is 1 mole. Each molecule has 5 σ bonds. So total σ bonds is 5 N_A. Option (B) says 4 N_A, which is wrong. \n\nFor (C): HCl gas at STP, 22.4 L is 1 mole. No H+ ions unless dissolved. Hence, (C) is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut the original options are labeled (A), (B), (C), (D). Depending on the exam, sometimes options are multiple correct. However, in some cases, maybe only one is correct. \n\nBut according to my analysis, (A) and (D) are correct. \n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. \n\nOriginal problem: \n\n(A) The number of neutrons in 1.8 g ¹⁸O is N_A. \n\nYes, correct. \n\n(B) The number of σ bonds in 28 g C₂H₄ is 4 N_A. No, it's 5 N_A. \n\n(C) Under standard conditions, the number of H+ in 22.4 L HCl gas is N_A. No. \n\n(D) The number of OH⁻ in Na₂CO₃ solution with pH=12 is 0.01 N_A. Assuming 1L, yes. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut maybe the original question is from a source where only one option is correct? Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation for (D). \n\nIf pH=12, then [H+]=1e-12 M. Therefore, [OH⁻]=1e-2 M. \n\nBut the number of OH⁻ ions is [OH⁻] * V * N_A. \n\nIf V is 1L, then it's 0.01 mol, so 0.01 N_A. \n\nBut if the volume is not given, then the answer can't be determined. However, in many cases, when pH is given and they ask about the number of ions, they assume 1L. \n\nTherefore, (D) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check if there's any other catch. For example, in Na₂CO₃ solution, the OH⁻ comes from hydrolysis. However, the pH is given, so the [OH⁻] is fixed. So regardless of the source, the number is determined by pH and volume. \n\nTherefore, assuming 1L, it's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be (A) and (D). \n\nBut looking at the original options, the user might expect multiple correct answers. However, in some cases, maybe only one is correct. But according to calculations, (A) and (D) are correct. \n\nBut let me check again for (D). If the solution is not 1L, then it's wrong. However, since no volume is given, is there any other standard? For example, if it's referring to the solution made by dissolving 1 mole of Na₂CO₃? No, because the pH is given as 12, which would depend on the concentration. \n\nTherefore, without volume, it's impossible to know. However, given that the answer is presented as 0.01 N_A, which is 1e-2 mol, and since [OH⁻] is 1e-2 M, the volume must be 1L. \n\nTherefore, the question assumes 1L. Hence, (D) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check once more for (A). \n\n¹⁸O has 8 protons and 10 neutrons. \n\n1.8 g / 18 g/mol = 0.1 mol. \n\nNumber of atoms = 0.1 mol × N_A. \n\nNumber of neutrons = 0.1 × N_A × 10 = 1 × N_A. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, (A) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut maybe in the original problem, only one is correct? Let me check if there's a mistake in my analysis. \n\nFor (D), another thought: In a solution of Na₂CO₃, the carbonate ion hydrolyzes: \n\nCO₃²⁻ + H2O ↔ HCO3⁻ + OH⁻ \n\nSo the concentration of OH⁻ depends on the concentration of Na₂CO₃. However, the pH is given as 12, which allows us to calculate [OH⁻], but without knowing the volume, we can't find the number of OH⁻ ions. \n\nBut again, if we assume 1L, then yes. \n\nTherefore, the answer depends on that assumption. \n\nGiven that, and given that (A) is definitely correct, and (D) is correct under the assumption of 1L, I think the intended correct answers are (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check if there are any other possible errors. \n\nFor example, in option (D), does the solution contain other sources of OH⁻? For example, water autoionization? But at pH=12, the contribution from water is negligible. \n\nTherefore, the main source is the hydrolysis, but the pH already accounts for that. \n\nTherefore, [OH⁻] is 0.01 M. \n\nTherefore, assuming 1L, number is 0.01 N_A. \n\nTherefore, (D) is correct. \n\nThus, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check if the original problem might have different options. \n\nThe user presented options (A)-(D), and in Chinese exams, sometimes the options are labeled with multiple correct answers, but sometimes they are single-choice. However, since the user hasn't specified, but given that both (A) and (D) are correct, I need to check if the original problem allows multiple correct answers. \n\nSince the user hasn't specified, but in the initial problem statement, the options are listed as (A), (B), (C), (D), and the user is asking which are correct, so likely multiple can be correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answers are (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nIs there any chance that (D) is incorrect? For example, if the solution is not 1L. But since no volume is given, it's impossible to say. However, in the absence of volume, and given that the answer is presented as 0.01 N_A, it's logical to assume 1L. \n\nTherefore, I think the intended correct answers are (A) and (D). \n\nBut looking back at my analysis, I think that's correct. \n\nSo the final answer should be options (A) and (D). \n\nBut let me check once again if there is any mistake in the calculation for (D). \n\npH=12 → pOH=2 → [OH⁻] = 1e-2 M. \n\nNumber of moles of OH⁻ = [OH⁻] × volume in liters. \n\nAssuming volume is 1L, moles = 0.01 mol → 0.01 N_A. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, (D) is correct. \n\nThus, the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\nHowever, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user might have intended only one correct answer, but based on calculations, two are correct. \n\nTherefore, I will conclude that the correct options are (A) and (D). \n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{A} and \\boxed{D}\n\nBut since the platform might require a single boxed answer, and if multiple are allowed, but in Chinese exams, sometimes answers are given as multiple letters. However, the standard here might be to list all correct options. \n\nBut according to the instructions, the user says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Since multiple answers might need to be boxed, but typically for multiple correct answers in Chinese exams, they might expect to select all correct ones. However, since the user hasn't specified, but in many cases, only one is correct. \n\nWait, but in my analysis, both (A) and (D) are correct. \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nFor (D), if the volume is not given, it's ambiguous. However, given that the answer is presented as 0.01 N_A, which is 0.01 mol, and [OH⁻] is 0.01 M, the volume must be 1L. Hence, it's implied. \n\nTherefore, the correct answers are (A) and (D). \n\nBut since I need to present the final answer as per the platform's requirement, which usually expects one box, but if multiple, perhaps boxed together. \n\nHowever, in Chinese exams, sometimes options are labeled with multiple letters, like AD. \n\nBut since I can't be sure, but based on the calculation, both (A) and (D) are correct. \n\nTherefore, I will box both.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A} and \\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
