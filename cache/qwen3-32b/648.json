The rectangle has vertices at (5,4), (5,-4), (-5,4), and (-5,-4). Let me visualize this first. \n\nFirst, plotting these points in my mind, the rectangle is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis. The left and right sides are at x = -5 and x = 5, while the top and bottom sides are at y = 4 and y = -4. So, it's a rectangle that's 10 units wide (from -5 to 5 on the x-axis) and 8 units tall (from -4 to 4 on the y-axis). \n\nBut wait, when they say \"strictly inside,\" that means we don't include the boundary points. So, the integer points that lie strictly inside must have x-coordinates strictly between -5 and 5, and y-coordinates strictly between -4 and 4. \n\nSo, for the x-coordinate: since it's strictly between -5 and 5, the integer values of x must satisfy -4 ≤ x ≤ 4. Similarly, for the y-coordinate: strictly between -4 and 4, so integer values must satisfy -3 ≤ y ≤ 3. \n\nLet me check that. If x is strictly greater than -5 and strictly less than 5, then integers would be from -4 up to 4, inclusive. Because -5 is excluded, so the next integer is -4, and similarly 5 is excluded, so up to 4. Same for y: between -4 and 4, so integers from -3 to 3 inclusive. \n\nSo, how many integer x-values are there? From -4 to 4 inclusive. Let me count. From -4 to 4, that's 4 - (-4) + 1? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is -4, b is 4. So 4 - (-4) + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9? Let me count manually: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Yep, that's 9 numbers. \n\nSimilarly for y-coordinates: from -3 to 3 inclusive. Using the same formula: 3 - (-3) + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7. Let me check: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. Yep, 7 numbers. \n\nSo, if there are 9 possible x-values and 7 possible y-values, then the total number of integer coordinate points strictly inside the rectangle is 9 multiplied by 7. \n\nCalculating that: 9 * 7 = 63. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nThe rectangle spans from x=-5 to x=5. The integer points strictly inside would have x coordinates from -4 to 4 inclusive. Similarly, y from -3 to 3 inclusive. \n\nAnother way to think about this is using the formula for the number of lattice points inside a rectangle. If a rectangle has width w and height h, then the number of interior points would be (w - 1) * (h - 1). Wait, but actually, that's not quite accurate. Because the width here is from -5 to 5 on the x-axis. The total number of integer points along the x-axis including the boundary would be from -5 to 5 inclusive, which is 11 points. But strictly inside is 9 points, which is 11 - 2 = 9. Similarly, for the y-axis, from -4 to 4 inclusive, there are 9 points (since 4 - (-4) + 1 = 9). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, for y: original rectangle's y ranges from -4 to 4. The number of integer points on the boundary is 4 - (-4) + 1 = 9? Wait, but earlier I thought strictly inside was 7. So if total points along y-axis including boundary is 9, then strictly inside is 9 - 2 = 7. Similarly for x-axis: total points including boundary is 11 (from -5 to 5 inclusive: 5 - (-5) +1 = 11). Then strictly inside is 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, total interior points is 9*7 = 63. \n\nBut another formula I remember is something like (length - 1) * (width - 1). Let me check. If the rectangle has length (horizontal) of 10 units (from -5 to 5) and width (vertical) of 8 units (from -4 to 4). Then, according to some formula, the number of interior points is (length - 1) * (width - 1). But here length is 10, so 10 - 1 = 9, width is 8, so 8 -1 = 7. Then 9 * 7 = 63. So that matches. \n\nTherefore, seems like 63 is the answer. But let me verify with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, think of the rectangle as from x = -5 to x = 5 and y = -4 to y = 4. The number of integer points strictly inside is the same as the number of integer points in the rectangle from x = -4 to x = 4 and y = -3 to y = 3. Because we are moving inside by 1 unit on all sides. \n\nSo, for x from -4 to 4 inclusive: how many integers? Let me count again. From -4 to 4, that's 4 - (-4) = 8 units, but number of integers is 9. Similarly, y from -3 to 3: 3 - (-3) = 6 units, number of integers is 7. So total points 9*7=63. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use Pick's Theorem? \n\nPick's Theorem says that the area of a polygon with integer coordinates is equal to I + B/2 - 1, where I is the number of interior lattice points and B is the number of boundary lattice points. So if I can compute the area and the number of boundary points, I can solve for I. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nFirst, compute the area of the rectangle. The length is 10 (from -5 to 5) and the width is 8 (from -4 to 4). So area is 10*8=80. \n\nNow compute B, the number of boundary points. \n\nFor a rectangle, the number of boundary points can be calculated by the perimeter minus 4 (since the four corners are counted twice if we just do perimeter). Wait, actually, perimeter formula for lattice points is a bit different. \n\nThe formula for the number of lattice points on the boundary of an axis-aligned rectangle with sides parallel to the axes is 2*(width + height) - 4. Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nFor each side:\n\nTop side: from (-5,4) to (5,4). The number of lattice points on this side is the number of integer x from -5 to 5 inclusive, which is 11. Similarly, bottom side: same, 11 points. Left side: from (-5,-4) to (-5,4). Number of integer y from -4 to 4 inclusive, which is 9 points. Similarly, right side: same, 9 points. \n\nBut if I add them up: top + bottom + left + right = 11 + 11 + 9 + 9 = 40. However, the four corner points are counted twice each. So subtract 4. Therefore total boundary points B = 40 - 4 = 36. \n\nLet me check that. So each corner is shared by two sides, so yes, we subtract 4. So B = 36. \n\nSo according to Pick's theorem:\n\nArea = I + B/2 - 1 => 80 = I + 36/2 - 1 => 80 = I + 18 - 1 => 80 = I + 17 => I = 80 - 17 = 63. \n\nSo Pick's theorem also gives I = 63. Which matches the previous results. \n\nTherefore, this gives me more confidence that 63 is the correct answer. \n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can do a small example. Let's take a smaller rectangle where I can count manually. \n\nSuppose we have a rectangle with vertices at (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1). So it's a square from x=-1 to 1 and y=-1 to 1. The strictly inside points would be those with x=0 and y=0. Only one point. \n\nUsing our formula: x strictly between -1 and 1: x=0. y strictly between -1 and 1: y=0. So 1*1=1. Correct. \n\nUsing Pick's theorem: Area is 2*2=4? Wait, no. Wait, the rectangle spans from -1 to 1 on x and y. So width is 2, height is 2. Area is 4. \n\nBoundary points: top side from (-1,1) to (1,1): integer x from -1 to 1 inclusive, 3 points. Similarly bottom: 3. Left side: y from -1 to 1: 3. Right side: same 3. Total 3+3+3+3=12, minus 4 corners counted twice: 12-4=8. \n\nPick's theorem: 4 = I + 8/2 -1 => 4 = I + 4 -1 => 4 = I + 3 => I=1. Correct. \n\nSo Pick's theorem works here. Therefore, our calculation for the original problem is likely correct. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of another small example. Let's take rectangle with vertices at (2,1), (2,-1), (-2,1), (-2,-1). So x from -2 to 2, y from -1 to 1. \n\nStrictly inside points: x between -1 and 1 (so -1, 0, 1), y between 0. Wait, y strictly between -1 and 1 is y=0. So number of points is 3*1=3. \n\nCheck with formula: x from -1, 0, 1 (3 values), y from 0 (1 value). Correct. \n\nPick's theorem: area is width 4 (from -2 to 2) times height 2 (from -1 to 1): 8. \n\nBoundary points: top side: x from -2 to 2 inclusive, y=1: 5 points. Similarly bottom: 5. Left side: x=-2, y from -1 to 1: 3 points. Similarly right side: 3. Total 5+5+3+3=16, minus 4 corners: 16-4=12. \n\nPick's theorem: 8 = I + 12/2 -1 => 8 = I + 6 -1 => 8 = I +5 => I=3. Correct. \n\nSo again, works. \n\nTherefore, going back, our original problem's answer is 63. \n\nBut just to check again, maybe I can think of how many columns and rows. \n\nFor x from -4 to 4 inclusive, that's 9 columns (each column is a vertical line x=constant). For each column, how many y's? From -3 to 3 inclusive, which is 7. So 9 columns * 7 = 63. \n\nAlternatively, maybe visualize a grid. But since it's symmetric, maybe count one quadrant and multiply? \n\nFor example, consider the first quadrant where x > 0, y > 0. But since x is up to 4 and y up to 3. But since the rectangle is symmetric over both axes, maybe calculate the number in one quadrant and multiply by 4, then add any points on the axes if necessary. Wait, but since we're dealing with strictly inside points, which excludes the boundaries. However, the origin (0,0) is inside. \n\nBut maybe this complicates. Let me see. \n\nIn the first quadrant (excluding axes?), no. Wait, if we divide into quadrants, but since x ranges from -4 to 4 and y from -3 to 3, maybe splitting into quadrants would require careful consideration. \n\nAlternatively, think of all points where x and y are positive. So x from 1 to 4 (since strictly inside, so x can't be 0? No, wait x can be 0. Wait, no, strictly inside the rectangle, which includes x=0. Wait, if I want to split into quadrants, the first quadrant would be x > 0 and y > 0. But since x can be 0 or negative, maybe it's messy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe not necessary. Since we already have two methods giving 63 and Pick's theorem also gives 63, and small cases check out, probably safe. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of how many points are there in total inside the rectangle including the boundary, then subtract the boundary points. \n\nTotal number of points including boundary: x from -5 to 5 (11 values) and y from -4 to 4 (9 values). So 11*9 = 99. \n\nNumber of boundary points: 36, as calculated before. \n\nBut wait, according to Pick's theorem, Area = I + B/2 - 1. So I = Area - B/2 + 1. \n\nBut also, total points (including boundary) is I + B. Wait, no. Wait, total points T = I + B? No. Because I is the interior points, and B is the boundary points. But actually, T is the total number of lattice points inside and on the boundary. \n\nBut how is T related to I and B? Well, if T is I + B, then yes. But according to Pick's theorem, Area = I + B/2 - 1. \n\nSo if I want to compute I, I can use Pick's theorem. But if I compute T, it's I + B. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute T as 11*9 = 99. Then if we can compute B as 36, then I = T - B = 99 - 36 = 63. Which is the same as before. \n\nYes, that works. So that's another way to get 63. \n\nTherefore, all methods converge to 63. \n\nHence, I think the answer is 63. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangular region is \\boxed{63}.\n</think>"}
