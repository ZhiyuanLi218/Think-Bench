Let me start by recalling what I know about orbital mechanics. I remember that when a satellite orbits a planet or a moon, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force to keep it in orbit. Maybe I can use that relationship to find the mass of the moon.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given data:\n\n- Altitude of the satellite above the lunar surface: 200 km\n- Orbital period: 127 minutes\n- Gravitational constant G: 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg²\n- Radius of the moon: 1.74 × 10³ km\n\nWait, the altitude is 200 km, so the total distance from the center of the moon to the satellite would be the radius of the moon plus the altitude. Let me convert those into meters because the gravitational constant uses meters. \n\nFirst, converting the radius of the moon and the altitude to meters:\n\nRadius of the moon, R_moon = 1.74 × 10³ km = 1.74 × 10^6 meters (since 1 km = 10^3 m)\n\nAltitude, h = 200 km = 200 × 10^3 m = 2 × 10^5 m\n\nTherefore, the orbital radius r = R_moon + h = 1.74 × 10^6 m + 2 × 10^5 m. Let me calculate that:\n\n1.74 × 10^6 is the same as 1.74 × 10^6. Adding 0.2 × 10^6 (since 2 × 10^5 = 0.2 × 10^6) gives 1.74 + 0.2 = 1.94 × 10^6 meters. So r = 1.94 × 10^6 m.\n\nNext, the orbital period T is given as 127 minutes. I need to convert that into seconds because standard SI units for physics equations are seconds. \n\n127 minutes × 60 seconds per minute = 127 × 60. Let me calculate that. 100 minutes is 6000 seconds, 27 minutes is 1620 seconds. Total is 6000 + 1620 = 7620 seconds. Let me check: 127 × 60. 120 × 60 = 7200, 7 × 60 = 420, so total 7200 + 420 = 7620 seconds. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, using the formula that relates orbital period and radius to the mass of the central body. The formula comes from equating gravitational force to centripetal force.\n\nThe gravitational force between the moon and the satellite is F_grav = G * M * m / r², where M is the mass of the moon, m is the mass of the satellite. The centripetal force required for circular motion is F_cent = m * v² / r. Since these are equal:\n\nG * M * m / r² = m * v² / r\n\nWe can cancel the mass of the satellite m from both sides:\n\nG * M / r² = v² / r\n\nMultiply both sides by r²:\n\nG * M = v² * r\n\nThen, solving for M:\n\nM = (v² * r) / G\n\nBut I don't know the velocity v directly. However, I can express velocity in terms of the orbital period T. The orbital velocity v is the circumference of the orbit divided by the period T:\n\nv = 2πr / T\n\nSubstituting that into the equation for M:\n\nM = [( (2πr / T )² ) * r ] / G = (4π²r³) / (G T²)\n\nYes, that's the formula I remember from Kepler's third law. So the mass of the moon can be calculated using M = (4π²r³) / (G T²). Let me write that down:\n\nM = (4 * π² * r³) / (G * T²)\n\nNow plug in the numbers. Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute r³. r is 1.94 × 10^6 m.\n\nCalculating r³:\n\nFirst, 1.94³. Let me approximate that. 1.94 is approximately 2 - 0.06. But maybe just compute 1.94 × 1.94 × 1.94.\n\nFirst compute 1.94 × 1.94:\n\n1.94 × 1.94. Let me do 2 × 1.94 = 3.88, minus 0.06 × 1.94. Wait, maybe better to do standard multiplication:\n\n1.94 × 1.94:\n\n= (2 - 0.06)²\n\n= 4 - 2*2*0.06 + 0.06²\n\nWait, no: (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b². So if a = 2, b = 0.06:\n\n= 4 - 2*(2)*(0.06) + (0.06)^2\n\nWait, no. Wait, original is (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So if I take a = 1.94 and think of it as 2 - 0.06? Wait, 2 - 0.06 is 1.94? Wait 2 - 0.06 is 1.94? Yes, because 2 - 0.06 = 1.94. So then, (2 - 0.06)^2 = 4 - 2*2*0.06 + 0.06²? Wait no, it's a² - 2ab + b² where a is 2 and b is 0.06? Wait no, if the original expression is (a - b)^2, then it's a² - 2ab + b². But if I take a as 2 and b as 0.06, then yes. So:\n\n(2 - 0.06)^2 = 2² - 2*(2)*(0.06) + (0.06)^2 = 4 - 0.24 + 0.0036 = 4 - 0.24 is 3.76 + 0.0036 = 3.7636. Therefore, 1.94² ≈ 3.7636.\n\nNow multiply that by 1.94 to get 1.94³:\n\nSo 3.7636 × 1.94. Let me approximate this. Let me write 3.7636 × 2 = 7.5272. But since it's 1.94, which is 2 - 0.06, so 3.7636 × (2 - 0.06) = 7.5272 - 3.7636 × 0.06.\n\nCalculate 3.7636 × 0.06. Let's see:\n\n3.7636 × 0.06 = approx 0.2258. So subtract that from 7.5272:\n\n7.5272 - 0.2258 ≈ 7.3014. Therefore, 1.94³ ≈ 7.3014. So approximately 7.3 × 10^0. But actually, since r is 1.94 × 10^6 m, then r³ is (1.94 × 10^6)^3 = (1.94)^3 × (10^6)^3 = approx 7.3 × 10^18 m³. Wait, let me check:\n\n(10^6)^3 = 10^18. So yes, r³ ≈ 7.3 × 10^18 m³. Let me note that as approx 7.3 × 10^18 m³. But let me check with more precise calculation if possible. Maybe my estimation of 1.94³ is rough. Let me use calculator-like steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use exact numbers. Let me use exact value for r³.\n\nBut given that this is an approximation question, maybe my approximate value is sufficient. Let me proceed with 7.3 × 10^18 m³. However, let me check with more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calculator-like approach here. Let me try again.\n\nFirst, 1.94 × 1.94:\n\nLet me compute 1.94 × 1.94:\n\nFirst, 1.9 × 1.9 = 3.61. Then, 1.9 × 0.04 = 0.076, 0.04 × 1.9 = 0.076, and 0.04 × 0.04 = 0.0016. Wait, maybe breaking it down as (a + b)^2 where a = 1.9, b = 0.04:\n\n(1.9 + 0.04)^2 = 1.9² + 2*1.9*0.04 + 0.04² = 3.61 + 0.152 + 0.0016 = 3.61 + 0.152 is 3.762 + 0.0016 = 3.7636. So that's the same as before. So 1.94² = 3.7636. Then multiplying by 1.94:\n\n3.7636 × 1.94. Let me compute this as:\n\nFirst, 3.7636 × 1.94 = 3.7636 × (2 - 0.06) = 7.5272 - 0.225816 ≈ 7.5272 - 0.2258 ≈ 7.3014. So yes, approx 7.3014 × 10^0. Therefore, r³ ≈ 7.3014 × 10^18 m³. Let me take that as approximately 7.3 × 10^18 m³. \n\nNow, moving on. The next part is 4π². Let me compute 4π². π is approximately 3.1416, so π² ≈ 9.8696. Therefore, 4 × π² ≈ 4 × 9.8696 ≈ 39.4784. Let me just use 39.48 for simplicity.\n\nSo the numerator is 4π²r³ ≈ 39.48 × 7.3 × 10^18. Let me compute 39.48 × 7.3. Let me approximate that:\n\nFirst, 40 × 7.3 = 292. But since it's 39.48, which is 40 - 0.52. So:\n\n(40 - 0.52) × 7.3 = 40 × 7.3 - 0.52 × 7.3 = 292 - 3.796 ≈ 292 - 3.8 ≈ 288.2. Therefore, approximately 288.2 × 10^18. So numerator ≈ 2.882 × 10^20. Let me write that as approx 2.88 × 10^20.\n\nNow the denominator is G × T². G is given as 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg². T is 7620 seconds. Let me compute T² first.\n\nT = 7620 s. T² = (7.62 × 10^3)^2 = 7.62² × 10^6. Let me compute 7.62 squared. 7.6² is 57.76. Then, 7.62² = (7.6 + 0.02)^2 = 7.6² + 2×7.6×0.02 + 0.02² = 57.76 + 0.304 + 0.0004 = 58.0644. So approximately 58.06 × 10^6 s². Therefore, T² ≈ 5.806 × 10^7 s². Wait, because 7.62 × 10^3 squared is 58.06 × 10^6, which is 5.806 × 10^7? Wait:\n\n(7.62 × 10³)^2 = 7.62² × (10³)^2 = 58.06 × 10^6 = 5.806 × 10^7. Yes, correct. So T² ≈ 5.806 × 10^7 s².\n\nNow, G × T² = 6.67 × 10^-11 × 5.806 × 10^7. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst multiply 6.67 × 5.806. Let me approximate 6.67 × 5.8. Let me compute 6 × 5.8 = 34.8, 0.67 × 5.8 ≈ 3.886. So total approx 34.8 + 3.886 ≈ 38.686. Let me check with more precise numbers:\n\n5.806 × 6.67. Let me do 5.806 × 6 = 34.836, 5.806 × 0.67. Let me compute 5.806 × 0.6 = 3.4836, 5.806 × 0.07 = 0.40642. Adding those gives 3.4836 + 0.40642 ≈ 3.890. So total is 34.836 + 3.890 ≈ 38.726. So approximately 38.73. Therefore, G × T² ≈ 38.73 × 10^(-11 + 7) = 38.73 × 10^-4 = 3.873 × 10^-3 N·m²/kg²·s²? Wait, the units are a bit complex, but the numerical value is 3.873 × 10^-3.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, M ≈ numerator / denominator ≈ (2.88 × 10^20) / (3.873 × 10^-3). Let me compute that division.\n\nFirst, divide 2.88 by 3.873. Let me approximate that. 3.873 × 0.74 ≈ 2.87 (since 3.873 × 0.7 = 2.711, 3.873 × 0.74 ≈ 2.711 + 3.873 × 0.04 ≈ 2.711 + 0.155 ≈ 2.866). So approx 0.74. Therefore, 2.88 / 3.873 ≈ approx 0.743. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\nLet me write 2.88 / 3.873. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to remove decimals: 2880 / 3873. Let me approximate this fraction. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 3: 960 / 1291. Hmm. Let me see how many times 1291 goes into 960. It's less than 1. Let me compute 1291 × 0.74 = approx 1291 × 0.7 + 1291 × 0.04 = 903.7 + 51.64 ≈ 955.34. Which is close to 960. So 0.74 + (960 - 955.34)/1291 ≈ 0.74 + 4.66 / 1291 ≈ 0.74 + 0.0036 ≈ 0.7436. So approx 0.744. Therefore, 2.88 / 3.873 ≈ 0.744. \n\nThen, multiplying by 10^(20 - (-3))? Wait, the numerator is 2.88 × 10^20 and denominator is 3.873 × 10^-3. Therefore, dividing them gives (2.88 / 3.873) × 10^(20 + 3) = approx 0.744 × 10^23 = 7.44 × 10^22 kg. \n\nSo the estimated mass of the moon is approximately 7.44 × 10^22 kg. Looking at the options given:\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) 8.1 × 10^10 kg – way too small.\n\n(B) 7.4 × 10^13 kg – still way too small.\n\n(C) 5.4 × 10^19 kg – still too small.\n\n(D) 7.4 × 10^22 kg – matches our approximate calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option D. \n\nBut let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, the orbital radius:\n\nRadius of moon: 1.74 × 10^3 km = 1.74 × 10^6 m. Altitude 200 km = 2 × 10^5 m. So total r = 1.74 × 10^6 + 0.2 × 10^6 = 1.94 × 10^6 m. Correct.\n\nOrbital period T: 127 minutes = 127 × 60 = 7620 seconds. Correct.\n\nFormula M = (4π²r³)/(G T²). Correct.\n\nCalculating r³: (1.94 × 10^6)^3. 1.94³ ≈ 7.3 × 10^0, so 7.3 × 10^18 m³. Correct.\n\n4π² ≈ 39.48. Correct.\n\nNumerator: 39.48 × 7.3 × 10^18 ≈ 288 × 10^18 = 2.88 × 10^20. Correct.\n\nDenominator: G T². T² is (7620)^2 = approx 5.8 × 10^7. Then G*T² is 6.67e-11 * 5.8e7 ≈ 3.87e-3. Correct.\n\nDividing 2.88e20 / 3.87e-3 ≈ 7.44e22. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's a standard value for the moon's mass. From what I remember, the mass of the moon is about 7.34 × 10^22 kg, which is very close to our calculated value of 7.44 × 10^22 kg. Given that we approximated some steps (like 1.94³ as 7.3 instead of a more precise value, and rounding during calculations), the slight difference is due to rounding errors. Therefore, option D is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAnother check: Let me recalculate r³ with more precision. Let me compute 1.94^3 exactly.\n\nEarlier, we had 1.94^3 ≈ 7.3014. Let me use more decimal places. Let me use calculator-like steps:\n\nFirst, 1.94 × 1.94 = 3.7636. Then 3.7636 × 1.94:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n3.7636 × 1.94:\n\nMultiply 3.7636 by 1.94:\n\nBreak down 1.94 as 1 + 0.9 + 0.04.\n\nFirst, 3.7636 × 1 = 3.7636\n\n3.7636 × 0.9 = 3.38724\n\n3.7636 × 0.04 = 0.150544\n\nAdd them up: 3.7636 + 3.38724 = 7.15084 + 0.150544 ≈ 7.301384. So exactly approximately 7.3014. So r³ is 7.3014 × 10^18 m³. Therefore, my previous value was accurate. \n\nThen 4π²r³ ≈ 39.478 × 7.3014 × 10^18. Let me compute 39.478 × 7.3014 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 39.478 × 7.3014:\n\nFirst, note that 39.478 × 7 = 276.346\n\n39.478 × 0.3 = 11.8434\n\n39.478 × 0.0014 ≈ 0.05527\n\nAdding up:\n\n276.346 + 11.8434 = 288.1894 + 0.05527 ≈ 288.2447. Therefore, the numerator is approximately 288.2447 × 10^18, which is 2.882447 × 10^20. So approx 2.882 × 10^20.\n\nDenominator: G*T² = 6.67 × 10^-11 * 5.806 × 10^7. Let me compute 6.67 × 5.806 again with more precision.\n\n5.806 × 6.67:\n\nBreak it down as (5 + 0.8 + 0.006) × 6.67\n\nFirst compute 5 × 6.67 = 33.35\n\n0.8 × 6.67 = 5.336\n\n0.006 × 6.67 = 0.04002\n\nAdding them together: 33.35 + 5.336 = 38.686 + 0.04002 ≈ 38.72602. Therefore, G*T² ≈ 38.726 × 10^(-11 + 7) = 38.726 × 10^-4 = 0.0038726.\n\nTherefore, M ≈ 2.882 × 10^20 / 0.0038726 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 2.882 / 0.0038726. Let me write this as 2.882 / 0.0038726 ≈ ?\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 0.001: 2882 / 3.8726 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 3.8726 × 744 = ?\n\nWell, let me do 3.8726 × 700 = 2710.82\n\n3.8726 × 40 = 154.904\n\n3.8726 × 4 = 15.4904\n\nAdding them up: 2710.82 + 154.904 = 2865.724 + 15.4904 ≈ 2881.2144. \n\nWow, so 3.8726 × 744 ≈ 2881.21. Which is very close to 2882. Therefore, 2.882 / 0.0038726 ≈ 744. So M ≈ 744 × 10^20 / 10^3? Wait, no. Wait the original was 2.882 × 10^20 divided by 0.0038726, which is 2.882 / 0.0038726 × 10^20. And we found that 2.882 / 0.0038726 ≈ 744. Therefore, M ≈ 744 × 10^20? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait the denominator was 0.0038726 which is 3.8726 × 10^-3. Therefore, dividing by that is multiplying by 10^3 / 3.8726. Wait, perhaps I confused steps here. Let me rephrase:\n\nOriginal value:\n\nM ≈ (2.882 × 10^20) / (3.8726 × 10^-3) = (2.882 / 3.8726) × 10^(20 + 3) ≈ (0.744) × 10^23 ≈ 7.44 × 10^22 kg. Exactly as before. And since 3.8726 × 744 ≈ 2881.2, which is almost 2.882 × 10^3, so 2.882 × 10^3 / 3.8726 ≈ 744. Therefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, M ≈ 7.44 × 10^22 kg, which is option D. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
