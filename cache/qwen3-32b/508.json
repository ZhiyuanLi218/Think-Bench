The problem mentions that $ k $ is in radians, which is important because the sine function's behavior depends on the unit. Let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities or formulas that might help me compute this sum.\n\nI remember that there's a formula for the sum of sines of an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to recall it. I think it's something like:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^n \\sin(k\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n + 1)\\theta}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nIs that right? Let me check for a simple case. Let’s take $ n = 1 $:\n\nLeft-hand side: $ \\sin(\\theta) $\n\nRight-hand side: $ \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)} = \\sin(\\theta) $. Okay, that works. Let me check $ n = 2 $:\n\nLeft-hand side: $ \\sin(\\theta) + \\sin(2\\theta) $\n\nRight-hand side: $ \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)} $\n\nHmm, let me compute this. Let me use $ \\theta = \\pi/2 $ for testing.\n\nLeft-hand side: $ \\sin(\\pi/2) + \\sin(\\pi) = 1 + 0 = 1 $\n\nRight-hand side: $ \\frac{\\sin(\\pi/2) \\cdot \\sin(3\\pi/4)}{\\sin(\\pi/4)} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1 $. Okay, that works. Maybe the formula is correct.\n\nSo, applying this formula to our problem where $ \\theta = 1 $ radian:\n\n$$\na_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sin(k) = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n + 1)}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The general formula is for $ \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sin(k\\theta) $, so in our case $ \\theta = 1 $. Therefore:\n\n$$\na_n = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{n \\cdot 1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n + 1) \\cdot 1}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. So this expression gives me $ a_n $. Now, I need to find the values of $ n $ for which $ a_n < 0 $, and specifically find the 100th such index.\n\nSo, first, let me analyze when this expression is negative. Since $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $ is positive (because $ \\frac{1}{2} $ radian is in the first quadrant), the sign of $ a_n $ depends on the product $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right) $.\n\nTherefore, $ a_n < 0 $ when $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right) < 0 $.\n\nSo, I need to find all integers $ n $ such that the product of those two sine terms is negative. Let me denote:\n\nLet me define $ x = \\frac{n}{2} $, so that $ \\frac{n + 1}{2} = x + \\frac{1}{2} $. Then the product becomes $ \\sin(x) \\cdot \\sin\\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) $.\n\nSo, the product $ \\sin(x) \\cdot \\sin(x + \\frac{1}{2}) < 0 $. Let me analyze when this product is negative.\n\nThe product of two sines is negative when one is positive and the other is negative. So, we need to find intervals where $ \\sin(x) $ and $ \\sin(x + \\frac{1}{2}) $ have opposite signs.\n\nLet me consider the function $ f(x) = \\sin(x) \\cdot \\sin(x + \\frac{1}{2}) $. To find when this is negative, let's analyze the sign changes.\n\nFirst, note that $ \\sin(x) $ and $ \\sin(x + \\frac{1}{2}) $ will have opposite signs when $ x $ is in intervals where one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nLet me find the zeros of each sine function.\n\nThe zeros of $ \\sin(x) $ are at $ x = k\\pi $, where $ k $ is integer.\n\nThe zeros of $ \\sin(x + \\frac{1}{2}) $ are at $ x + \\frac{1}{2} = m\\pi \\Rightarrow x = m\\pi - \\frac{1}{2} $, where $ m $ is integer.\n\nTherefore, the zeros of the product $ f(x) $ are at $ x = k\\pi $ and $ x = m\\pi - \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nTherefore, between each pair of consecutive zeros, the sign of $ f(x) $ alternates. Let me try to sketch the intervals where $ f(x) $ is negative.\n\nLet me consider the intervals between consecutive zeros. Let me take some intervals between $ x = k\\pi $ and $ x = (k + 1)\\pi $, and see where the other zeros $ x = m\\pi - 1/2 $ lie.\n\nFor example, between $ x = k\\pi $ and $ x = (k + 1)\\pi $, the function $ \\sin(x) $ goes from 0 up to 1 (if k even) or down to -1 (if k odd), then back to 0. The function $ \\sin(x + 1/2) $ will have a zero at $ x = m\\pi - 1/2 $. Let me find for each interval $ [k\\pi, (k + 1)\\pi] $, where exactly the zero of $ \\sin(x + 1/2) $ is.\n\nLet me solve for $ x $ in $ [k\\pi, (k + 1)\\pi] $ such that $ x = m\\pi - 1/2 $.\n\nThis would be when $ m\\pi - 1/2 \\in [k\\pi, (k + 1)\\pi] $, which implies $ k \\leq m - \\frac{1}{2\\pi} < k + 1 $. Since $ \\frac{1}{2\\pi} $ is approximately 0.159, so for each integer $ m $, there is a unique $ k $ such that $ k = m - 1 $ if $ m - \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\geq m - 1 $, which is always true. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, for each interval $ [k\\pi, (k + 1)\\pi] $, there is exactly one zero of $ \\sin(x + 1/2) $, which is at $ x = (m)\\pi - 1/2 $. Let me find m such that $ x = m\\pi - 1/2 \\in [k\\pi, (k + 1)\\pi] $. Therefore:\n\n$ k\\pi \\leq m\\pi - 1/2 \\leq (k + 1)\\pi $\n\nDivide by π:\n\n$ k \\leq m - 1/(2π) \\leq k + 1 $\n\nWhich implies:\n\n$ k + 1/(2π) \\leq m \\leq k + 1 + 1/(2π) $\n\nSince m must be integer, m is either floor(k + 1/(2π)) + 1 or ceil(k + 1/(2π)). But since 1/(2π) ≈ 0.159, so for each integer k, m is k + 1 if we take the upper bound? Wait, maybe m = k + 1?\n\nLet me check with k = 0:\n\nFor k = 0, interval [0, π]. Find m such that mπ - 1/2 ∈ [0, π]. So:\n\nmπ - 1/2 ≥ 0 ⇒ m ≥ 1/(2π) ≈ 0.159 ⇒ m ≥ 1\n\nmπ - 1/2 ≤ π ⇒ mπ ≤ π + 1/2 ⇒ m ≤ 1 + 1/(2π) ≈ 1.159 ⇒ m = 1.\n\nTherefore, for k = 0, m = 1, so x = π - 1/2 ≈ 2.588 radians.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 1, interval [π, 2π]. Solve mπ - 1/2 ∈ [π, 2π].\n\nmπ - 1/2 ≥ π ⇒ mπ ≥ π + 1/2 ⇒ m ≥ 1 + 1/(2π) ≈ 1.159 ⇒ m ≥ 2.\n\nmπ - 1/2 ≤ 2π ⇒ mπ ≤ 2π + 1/2 ⇒ m ≤ 2 + 1/(2π) ≈ 2.159 ⇒ m = 2.\n\nTherefore, x = 2π - 1/2 ≈ 6.283 - 0.5 = 5.783 radians.\n\nSimilarly, for general k, m = k + 1. Therefore, in each interval [kπ, (k + 1)π], there's a zero of sin(x + 1/2) at x = (k + 1)π - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, in each interval [kπ, (k + 1)π], the function sin(x) goes from 0 to ±1 and back to 0, while sin(x + 1/2) crosses zero once at x = (k + 1)π - 1/2. Therefore, depending on the sign of sin(x) and sin(x + 1/2) in different parts of the interval, we can determine when their product is negative.\n\nLet me consider two cases: when k is even and when k is odd.\n\nCase 1: k is even. Let k = 2m. Then the interval [kπ, (k + 1)π] = [2mπ, (2m + 1)π]. In this interval, sin(x) is positive from 2mπ to (2m + 1)π, because sine is positive in the first and second quadrants.\n\nNow, the zero of sin(x + 1/2) is at x = (k + 1)π - 1/2 = (2m + 1)π - 1/2. Let me denote this as x0 = (2m + 1)π - 1/2.\n\nSo, in the interval [2mπ, (2m + 1)π], sin(x) is positive. Let's check the sign of sin(x + 1/2) before and after x0.\n\nFor x < x0, x + 1/2 < (2m + 1)π - 1/2 + 1/2 = (2m + 1)π. Therefore, x + 1/2 is in [2mπ + 1/2, (2m + 1)π). The sine function here: from 2mπ + 1/2 to (2m + 1)π. Let me note that sin(θ) is positive in (2mπ, 2mπ + π), but at θ = 2mπ + π/2, sin(θ) = 1, then decreases to 0 at θ = 2mπ + π. Therefore, sin(x + 1/2) is positive in [2mπ + 1/2, 2mπ + π) and negative in (2mπ + π, ...). Wait, but our upper limit is (2m + 1)π, which is 2mπ + π. So, at x + 1/2 = 2mπ + π, sin(x + 1/2) = 0. Therefore, for x in [2mπ, x0), which translates to x + 1/2 in [2mπ + 1/2, (2m + 1)π), sin(x + 1/2) is positive (from 2mπ + 1/2 up to 2mπ + π). Therefore, in this interval, both sin(x) and sin(x + 1/2) are positive, so their product is positive. After x0, for x in (x0, (2m + 1)π), x + 1/2 is in ((2m + 1)π, (2m + 1)π + 1/2). Therefore, sin(x + 1/2) is negative here because it's in the third quadrant? Wait, θ = (2m + 1)π + something. Let me think: θ = (2m + 1)π + α, where α is between 0 and 1/2 radians. Then sin(θ) = sin(π + α + 2mπ) = -sin(α), which is negative. Therefore, sin(x + 1/2) is negative here, while sin(x) is still positive (since x is in [x0, (2m + 1)π]). Therefore, the product sin(x) * sin(x + 1/2) is negative here. Therefore, in the interval [x0, (2m + 1)π), the product is negative.\n\nTherefore, for k even (k = 2m), the product is negative in the interval [x0, (k + 1)π) where x0 = (k + 1)π - 1/2. Therefore, translating back to x, which is n/2, we can find the corresponding n.\n\nSimilarly, for k odd. Let me take k odd, say k = 2m + 1. Then the interval is [(2m + 1)π, (2m + 2)π]. In this interval, sin(x) is negative from (2m + 1)π to (2m + 2)π. The zero of sin(x + 1/2) is at x = (k + 1)π - 1/2 = (2m + 2)π - 1/2.\n\nFor x in [(2m + 1)π, (2m + 2)π - 1/2), x + 1/2 is in [(2m + 1)π + 1/2, (2m + 2)π). Let's analyze sin(x + 1/2). The interval [(2m + 1)π + 1/2, (2m + 2)π) can be rewritten as [(2m + 1)π + π/2, (2m + 2)π). Wait, π ≈ 3.14, so 1 radian is about 57 degrees, π/2 ≈ 1.57 radians. So 1/2 radian is less than π/2. Anyway, regardless of the exact value, let's note that θ = x + 1/2 is in [(2m + 1)π + 1/2, (2m + 2)π). Let's break it down:\n\nFrom θ = (2m + 1)π + 1/2 to θ = (2m + 1)π + π: sin(θ) is negative because it's in the third quadrant (from π to 2π). Wait, θ starts at (2m + 1)π + 1/2, which is π + 1/2 + 2mπ, so it's in the third quadrant? Wait, π + something. Let me take m = 0 for simplicity. Then θ is π + 1/2 to 2π. So from π + 1/2 (which is in the third quadrant) up to 2π. In this interval, sin(θ) is negative from π + 1/2 to 2π, except at 2π where it's zero. Therefore, sin(x + 1/2) is negative in x ∈ [(2m + 1)π, (2m + 2)π - 1/2). But in this interval, sin(x) is negative as well (since x is in [(2m + 1)π, (2m + 2)π]). Therefore, the product sin(x) * sin(x + 1/2) is positive here. Then, after x = (2m + 2)π - 1/2, which is x0, for x in (x0, (2m + 2)π), x + 1/2 is in ((2m + 2)π, (2m + 2)π + 1/2). Therefore, sin(x + 1/2) is positive here (since θ is in (2π, 2π + 1/2), which is the first quadrant). Therefore, sin(x) is still negative (since x is still in [(2m + 1)π, (2m + 2)π]), so the product sin(x) * sin(x + 1/2) is negative here. Therefore, for k odd, the product is negative in the interval (x0, (k + 1)π), where x0 = (k + 1)π - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nFor each interval [kπ, (k + 1)π], the product sin(x) * sin(x + 1/2) is negative in the subinterval [x0, (k + 1)π) when k is even and in the subinterval (x0, (k + 1)π) when k is odd, where x0 = (k + 1)π - 1/2. Therefore, in each interval [kπ, (k + 1)π], there is a subinterval of length 1/2 radians where the product is negative.\n\nTherefore, translating back to n, since x = n / 2, so n = 2x. Therefore, the values of n for which a_n < 0 correspond to n in the intervals:\n\nFor each integer k ≥ 0,\n\nIf k is even: n ∈ [2x0, 2(k + 1)π), where x0 = (k + 1)π - 1/2. So:\n\nLower bound: 2[(k + 1)π - 1/2] = 2(k + 1)π - 1\n\nUpper bound: 2(k + 1)π\n\nSimilarly, if k is odd: n ∈ (2x0, 2(k + 1)π), where x0 = (k + 1)π - 1/2. So:\n\nLower bound: 2[(k + 1)π - 1/2] = 2(k + 1)π - 1\n\nUpper bound: 2(k + 1)π\n\nWait, but for k even, the interval was [x0, (k + 1)π), so n ∈ [2x0, 2(k + 1)π). Similarly for k odd, the interval was (x0, (k + 1)π), so n ∈ (2x0, 2(k + 1)π). However, since n must be integer, we need to find integers n in these intervals.\n\nTherefore, for each k, there is an interval of n values where a_n < 0. The length of each interval is 2(k + 1)π - [2(k + 1)π - 1] = 1. Therefore, each interval has length 1 in n. However, since n must be integer, each interval will contain either 0 or 1 integer, depending on the exact position.\n\nWait, let me check. The interval for n is of length 1. For example, for k even, the interval is [2(k + 1)π - 1, 2(k + 1)π). The length is 1. Therefore, there is exactly one integer in this interval if 2(k + 1)π - 1 is not integer. Since π is irrational, 2(k + 1)π is irrational, so 2(k + 1)π - 1 is also irrational. Therefore, between 2(k + 1)π - 1 and 2(k + 1)π, there is exactly one integer, which is floor(2(k + 1)π). Similarly, for the interval (2(k + 1)π - 1, 2(k + 1)π), there is also exactly one integer, floor(2(k + 1)π). Therefore, for each k, there is exactly one integer n per k where a_n < 0. Therefore, the indices n where a_n < 0 correspond to n ≈ 2(k + 1)π for each k. However, since there is one n per k, then to get the 100th such n, we need to find k such that n ≈ 2(k + 1)π, and take the 100th one.\n\nWait, but let me check for specific k. Let me take k = 0. For k = 0, which is even. The interval is [2(0 + 1)π - 1, 2(0 + 1)π) = [2π - 1, 2π). Let me compute 2π ≈ 6.283, so 2π - 1 ≈ 5.283. Therefore, the interval [5.283, 6.283). The integer n in this interval is 6. Therefore, n = 6 is the first n where a_n < 0. Let me check if a_6 is indeed negative.\n\nCompute a_6 = sum_{k=1}^6 sin(k). Let me compute this numerically.\n\nCompute sin(1) ≈ 0.8415\n\nsin(2) ≈ 0.9093\n\nsin(3) ≈ 0.1411\n\nsin(4) ≈ -0.7568\n\nsin(5) ≈ -0.9589\n\nsin(6) ≈ -0.2794\n\nAdding them up:\n\n0.8415 + 0.9093 = 1.7508\n\n+ 0.1411 = 1.8919\n\n- 0.7568 = 1.1351\n\n- 0.9589 = 0.1762\n\n- 0.2794 ≈ -0.1032\n\nSo a_6 ≈ -0.1032 < 0. Correct. So n = 6 is the first n with a_n < 0. So for k = 0, we get n = 6.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 1, which is odd. The interval is (2(1 + 1)π - 1, 2(1 + 1)π) = (4π - 1, 4π). 4π ≈ 12.566, so 4π - 1 ≈ 11.566. Therefore, the interval (11.566, 12.566). The integer n here is 12. Let me check if a_12 < 0.\n\nBut instead of computing all terms up to 12, maybe I can use the formula:\n\na_n = [sin(n/2) * sin((n + 1)/2)] / sin(1/2)\n\nFor n = 12:\n\nsin(12/2) = sin(6) ≈ -0.2794\n\nsin((12 + 1)/2) = sin(6.5) ≈ sin(6.5 radians). Let me compute 6.5 radians. Since π ≈ 3.1416, 2π ≈ 6.283, so 6.5 radians is 6.5 - 2π ≈ 6.5 - 6.283 ≈ 0.217 radians above 2π. So sin(6.5) = sin(0.217) ≈ 0.215. Therefore, the product sin(6) * sin(6.5) ≈ (-0.2794)(0.215) ≈ -0.0601. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794, so a_12 ≈ -0.0601 / 0.4794 ≈ -0.125 < 0. So yes, a_12 is negative. Therefore, n = 12 is the second term where a_n < 0. So for k = 1, we get n = 12.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 2 (even), the interval is [2(2 + 1)π - 1, 2(2 + 1)π) = [6π - 1, 6π). 6π ≈ 18.849, so 6π - 1 ≈ 17.849. The integer n here is 18. Let me check with the formula:\n\nFor n = 18:\n\nsin(18/2) = sin(9). 9 radians is about 9 - 2π ≈ 9 - 6.283 ≈ 2.717 radians. sin(2.717) ≈ sin(π - 0.425) ≈ sin(0.425) ≈ 0.412. Wait, but 2.717 radians is in the second quadrant (between π/2 ≈ 1.57 and π ≈ 3.14). So sin(9) ≈ sin(2.717) ≈ sin(π - 0.425) = sin(0.425) ≈ 0.412. Wait, but actually, sin(π - x) = sin(x), so sin(2.717) = sin(π - (π - 2.717))... Wait, π ≈ 3.1416, so π - 2.717 ≈ 0.4246. Therefore, sin(2.717) = sin(π - 0.4246) = sin(0.4246) ≈ 0.412. So sin(9) ≈ 0.412.\n\nThen sin((18 + 1)/2) = sin(19/2) = sin(9.5). 9.5 radians is 9.5 - 3π ≈ 9.5 - 9.424 ≈ 0.076 radians. So sin(9.5) ≈ sin(0.076) ≈ 0.076. Therefore, the product sin(9) * sin(9.5) ≈ 0.412 * 0.076 ≈ 0.0313. Wait, but according to our previous analysis, for k even, the product should be negative. But here it's positive? Wait, something is wrong here. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, for k = 2 (even), the interval [kπ, (k + 1)π] is [2π, 3π]. The zero of sin(x + 1/2) is at x = 3π - 1/2 ≈ 9.4248 - 0.5 ≈ 8.9248. Therefore, in the interval [2π, 3π] (≈ [6.283, 9.4248]), the product sin(x) * sin(x + 1/2) is negative in [x0, 3π), where x0 ≈ 8.9248. Therefore, translating back to n, which is 2x, n ∈ [2x0, 2*(3π)) ≈ [17.849, 18.849). Therefore, n = 18. However, according to the formula, sin(9) * sin(9.5) ≈ 0.412 * 0.076 ≈ 0.0313, which is positive. But according to our analysis, this product should be negative. There must be an error here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate sin(9.5). 9.5 radians is 9.5 - 3π ≈ 9.5 - 9.4248 ≈ 0.0752 radians. So sin(9.5) = sin(π*3 + 0.0752) = sin(π*3 + α) where α ≈ 0.0752. But sin(π*3 + α) = sin(π + α + 2π) = sin(π + α) = -sin(α) ≈ -0.0752. Therefore, sin(9.5) ≈ -0.0752. Therefore, the product sin(9) * sin(9.5) ≈ 0.412 * (-0.0752) ≈ -0.0310. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794, gives a_n ≈ -0.0310 / 0.4794 ≈ -0.0646 < 0. So yes, a_18 is negative. My mistake earlier was not considering that sin(9.5) is negative because it's in the fourth quadrant (after subtracting 3π). So yes, the product is negative. Therefore, n = 18 is the third term where a_n < 0.\n\nTherefore, this seems to hold. So for each k ≥ 0, there is one n ≈ 2(k + 1)π where a_n < 0. Therefore, the indices n where a_n < 0 are approximately 2π, 4π, 6π, etc., but adjusted by some small amount because of the -1 in the lower bound. However, since π is irrational, each of these n's will be unique integers. Therefore, the sequence of n's where a_n < 0 is roughly 2π, 4π, 6π,... So approximately 6.28, 12.57, 18.85,... Therefore, the integer parts would be 6, 12, 18, 25,... Wait, let me check for k = 3 (odd). For k = 3, which is odd, the interval is (2(3 + 1)π - 1, 2(3 + 1)π) = (8π - 1, 8π). 8π ≈ 25.1327, so 8π - 1 ≈ 24.1327. Therefore, the integer n is 24 or 25? The interval is (24.1327, 25.1327). Therefore, the integer n is 25? Wait, 24.1327 to 25.1327 includes integers 25. So n = 25. Let me check with formula:\n\nFor n = 25:\n\nsin(25/2) = sin(12.5). 12.5 radians is 12.5 - 4π ≈ 12.5 - 12.566 ≈ -0.066 radians. Wait, sin(12.5) = sin(12.5 - 4π) ≈ sin(-0.066) ≈ -sin(0.066) ≈ -0.066.\n\nsin((25 + 1)/2) = sin(13). 13 radians is 13 - 4π ≈ 13 - 12.566 ≈ 0.434 radians. sin(13) ≈ sin(0.434) ≈ 0.421.\n\nTherefore, product sin(12.5) * sin(13) ≈ (-0.066)(0.421) ≈ -0.0278. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794 gives a_n ≈ -0.0278 / 0.4794 ≈ -0.058 < 0. So yes, a_25 is negative. Therefore, n = 25 is the fourth term where a_n < 0. Wait, but 8π ≈ 25.1327, so n ≈ 25.13, so floor(8π) = 25. So yes, n = 25.\n\nTherefore, the pattern seems to be that for each integer k ≥ 0, there is one n_k ≈ 2(k + 1)π where a_n < 0. Therefore, the indices are approximately 2π, 4π, 6π,... So to find the 100th such n, we need to compute n ≈ 2*100*π? Wait, no. Wait, for k starting at 0, each k gives one n. Therefore, for the m-th term, m = 1, 2, 3,... corresponds to k = m - 1. Therefore, the m-th term is approximately n ≈ 2mπ. Therefore, the 100th term would be approximately n ≈ 200π. However, since each n is floor(2(k + 1)π) or ceil(2(k + 1)π - 1), we need to adjust for the exact value. However, since π is irrational, 2(k + 1)π will never be integer, so floor(2(k + 1)π) is the integer n where a_n < 0.\n\nBut let me check with previous examples:\n\nFor m = 1 (first term), k = 0: n ≈ 2(0 + 1)π ≈ 6.28 → floor(6.28) = 6. Correct.\n\nFor m = 2 (second term), k = 1: n ≈ 2(1 + 1)π ≈ 12.57 → floor(12.57) = 12. Correct.\n\nFor m = 3 (third term), k = 2: n ≈ 2(2 + 1)π ≈ 18.85 → floor(18.85) = 18. Correct.\n\nFor m = 4 (fourth term), k = 3: n ≈ 2(3 + 1)π ≈ 25.13 → floor(25.13) = 25. Correct.\n\nTherefore, in general, the m-th term where a_n < 0 is floor(2mπ). Wait, but for m = 1, floor(2*1*π) = floor(6.28) = 6. Correct. For m = 2, floor(4π) = floor(12.566) = 12. Correct. For m = 3, floor(6π) = floor(18.849) = 18. Correct. For m = 4, floor(8π) = floor(25.132) = 25. Correct. Wait, but 8π is approximately 25.132, so floor(8π) is 25, which is correct. Therefore, in general, the m-th term is floor(2mπ). Therefore, the 100th term would be floor(200π). But let me check with m = 4, floor(2*4π) = floor(8π) = 25. Which matches. Therefore, if this pattern holds, then the answer is floor(200π). However, let me check with another term. Let me check m = 5. For m = 5, floor(10π) ≈ 31.415 → 31. Let me check if a_31 < 0 and a_32 ≥ 0?\n\nAlternatively, according to our previous logic, for k = 4 (since m = 5 corresponds to k = 4). For k = 4 (even), interval [2*5π - 1, 2*5π) ≈ [10π - 1, 10π) ≈ [31.415 - 1, 31.415) ≈ [30.415, 31.415). Therefore, integer n = 31. Therefore, floor(10π) = 31. So yes, m = 5 corresponds to n = 31. Therefore, the formula holds. Therefore, the m-th term is floor(2mπ). Therefore, the 100th term is floor(200π). Therefore, compute 200π.\n\nBut let me compute 200π numerically. π ≈ 3.1415926535, so 200π ≈ 628.3185307. Therefore, floor(200π) = 628. However, we need to confirm that for n = 628, a_n < 0, and that there are exactly 100 such terms up to n = 628. However, there is a possibility that due to the floor function, maybe sometimes floor(2mπ) doesn't correspond to the exact term? Wait, but according to our previous analysis, for each m, there is exactly one n in [2mπ - something, 2mπ), which is floor(2mπ). Therefore, if we take floor(2mπ) for m from 1 to 100, we get the 100 terms. Therefore, the answer is floor(200π) = 628. But let me check with m = 1 to 4, which worked. Let me check m = 5, n = 31. Let me check if a_31 < 0.\n\nBut calculating a_31 manually would be tedious, but using the formula:\n\na_n = [sin(n/2) * sin((n + 1)/2)] / sin(1/2)\n\nFor n = 31:\n\nsin(31/2) = sin(15.5). Let me compute 15.5 radians. 15.5 - 4π ≈ 15.5 - 12.566 ≈ 2.934 radians. sin(2.934) ≈ sin(π - 0.208) ≈ sin(0.208) ≈ 0.206. Wait, π ≈ 3.1416, so π - 2.934 ≈ 0.2076 radians. Therefore, sin(2.934) = sin(π - 0.2076) = sin(0.2076) ≈ 0.2067. So positive.\n\nsin((31 + 1)/2) = sin(16). 16 radians is 16 - 5π ≈ 16 - 15.707 ≈ 0.293 radians. sin(0.293) ≈ 0.288. Therefore, the product sin(15.5) * sin(16) ≈ 0.2067 * 0.288 ≈ 0.0596. Wait, but according to our previous analysis, for k = 4 (even), the product should be negative. Wait, there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, let me recast. For k = 4 (even), the interval [kπ, (k + 1)π] is [4π, 5π] ≈ [12.566, 15.708]. The zero of sin(x + 1/2) is at x = 5π - 1/2 ≈ 15.708 - 0.5 ≈ 15.208. Therefore, in the interval [4π, 5π], the product sin(x) * sin(x + 1/2) is negative in [x0, 5π) ≈ [15.208, 15.708). Therefore, translating back to n = 2x, the interval for n is [2x0, 2*5π) ≈ [30.416, 31.416). Therefore, integer n = 31. Therefore, according to our formula, a_31 < 0. However, according to the calculation above, sin(15.5) * sin(16) ≈ positive * positive = positive? Wait, but according to the previous analysis, it should be negative. There's an inconsistency here. What is wrong?\n\nWait, let me recalculate sin(15.5) and sin(16). Let me use more accurate calculations.\n\nFirst, sin(15.5 radians):\n\n15.5 radians. Let me subtract multiples of 2π to find the equivalent angle between 0 and 2π.\n\nCompute 15.5 / (2π) ≈ 15.5 / 6.283 ≈ 2.469. Therefore, 2π * 2 = 12.566. Subtract 12.566 from 15.5: 15.5 - 12.566 ≈ 2.934 radians. So sin(15.5) = sin(2.934). 2.934 radians is π - 0.2076 radians ≈ 3.1416 - 0.2076 ≈ 2.934 radians. Therefore, sin(2.934) = sin(π - 0.2076) = sin(0.2076) ≈ 0.2067. So positive.\n\nsin(16 radians):\n\n16 radians. Let me subtract 5*2π = 10π ≈ 31.416? No, wait 2π ≈ 6.283. 16 / (2π) ≈ 2.55. So subtract 2*2π = 4π ≈ 12.566. 16 - 12.566 ≈ 3.434 radians. sin(3.434). 3.434 radians is π + 0.292 radians ≈ 3.1416 + 0.292 ≈ 3.4336 radians. Therefore, sin(3.434) = -sin(0.292) ≈ -0.287. Therefore, sin(16) ≈ -0.287. Therefore, the product sin(15.5) * sin(16) ≈ 0.2067 * (-0.287) ≈ -0.0593. Therefore, divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794 gives a_n ≈ -0.0593 / 0.4794 ≈ -0.1237 < 0. Therefore, a_31 is indeed negative. My mistake earlier was miscalculating sin(16). I thought it was positive, but it's actually negative. Therefore, the product is negative. Therefore, our formula holds. Therefore, n = floor(2mπ) gives the correct term. Therefore, for m = 100, n = floor(200π).\n\nBut let me check another example to be safe. Let me take m = 5, n = 31. According to our previous calculation, a_31 < 0. Then for m = 6, floor(12π) ≈ 37.699 → 37. Let me check if a_37 < 0.\n\nFor n = 37:\n\nsin(37/2) = sin(18.5). Let me compute 18.5 radians. Subtract multiples of 2π. 18.5 / (2π) ≈ 2.946. Subtract 2*2π = 4π ≈ 12.566. 18.5 - 12.566 ≈ 5.934 radians. 5.934 radians is 5.934 - 2π ≈ 5.934 - 6.283 ≈ -0.349 radians. sin(-0.349) ≈ -sin(0.349) ≈ -0.342.\n\nsin((37 + 1)/2) = sin(19). 19 radians. Subtract multiples of 2π. 19 / (2π) ≈ 3.02. Subtract 3*2π = 6π ≈ 18.849. 19 - 18.849 ≈ 0.151 radians. sin(0.151) ≈ 0.150. Therefore, the product sin(18.5)*sin(19) ≈ (-0.342)*(0.150) ≈ -0.0513. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794 gives a_n ≈ -0.0513 / 0.4794 ≈ -0.107 < 0. Therefore, a_37 < 0. Therefore, n = 37 is the sixth term. And floor(12π) ≈ 37.699 → 37. Correct. So this seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the m-th term where a_n < 0 is floor(2mπ). Therefore, for the 100th term, it's floor(200π). Let me compute 200π with more precision.\n\nπ ≈ 3.141592653589793.\n\n200π ≈ 200 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 200 * 3 = 600\n\n200 * 0.141592653589793 ≈ 200 * 0.141592653589793 ≈ 28.3185307179586\n\nTherefore, total ≈ 600 + 28.3185 ≈ 628.3185. Therefore, floor(200π) = 628. Therefore, the 100th term is 628? But wait, we need to make sure that there are exactly 100 terms up to n = 628. However, there's a possibility that sometimes floor(2mπ) might not increment by exactly 1 each time, but given that π is irrational, the fractional parts of 2mπ are uniformly distributed, so there shouldn't be two m's where floor(2mπ) is the same. However, to be thorough, we need to confirm that for each m from 1 to 100, floor(2mπ) gives unique integers and that there are no overlaps or skips.\n\nBut given that π is irrational, 2π is also irrational, so the sequence {2mπ} (fractional part) is dense in [0,1), and thus floor(2mπ) = floor(2(m-1)π + 2π) = floor(2(m-1)π) + floor(2π + fractional_part). Since 2π ≈ 6.28, which is more than 6, so floor(2mπ) should increase by approximately 6 each time, but with some variation. However, since the fractional parts are different, each floor(2mπ) will be unique and increasing by either 6 or 7? Wait, for example:\n\nFor m = 1: floor(2π) = 6\n\nm = 2: floor(4π) = 12\n\nm = 3: floor(6π) = 18\n\nm = 4: floor(8π) = 25\n\nWait, from 18 to 25 is +7.\n\nSimilarly, m = 5: floor(10π) ≈ 31.4 → 31, so from 25 to 31 is +6.\n\nm = 6: floor(12π) ≈ 37.7 → 37, +6.\n\nm = 7: floor(14π) ≈ 43.98 → 43, +6.\n\nm = 8: floor(16π) ≈ 50.27 → 50, +7? Wait 43 + 7 = 50. Yes.\n\nSo alternates between +6 and +7? Depending on the fractional part. Therefore, over time, floor(2mπ) increases by approximately 6.28 each time, so sometimes +6, sometimes +7. However, since we are taking floor(2mπ), each m gives a unique n, and there are no overlaps. Therefore, for m from 1 to 100, floor(2mπ) gives 100 unique integers, each corresponding to a unique n where a_n < 0. Therefore, the 100th term is floor(200π) = 628. However, we need to verify that there isn't an n between 628 and 200π (which is ~628.318) where a_n is also negative. Wait, but according to our previous analysis, for each m, there is exactly one n in the interval [2mπ - 1, 2mπ) or similar, which is floor(2mπ). Therefore, for m = 100, the n is floor(200π) = 628. However, let me check if a_628 < 0 and a_629 ≥ 0?\n\nAlternatively, since our formula says that a_n < 0 iff n ≈ 2mπ for some m. Therefore, for n = 628, which is floor(200π), we can check using the formula:\n\na_n = [sin(n/2) * sin((n + 1)/2)] / sin(1/2)\n\nFor n = 628:\n\nCompute sin(628 / 2) = sin(314)\n\nCompute sin(314 radians). Let me find 314 modulo 2π.\n\nFirst, compute how many times 2π fits into 314.\n\n2π ≈ 6.28319\n\nCompute 314 / 6.28319 ≈ 314 / 6.28319 ≈ 50. (Since 50 * 6.28319 ≈ 314.1595). Therefore, 314 radians ≈ 50*2π - 0.1595 radians. Therefore, sin(314) = sin(-0.1595) ≈ -sin(0.1595) ≈ -0.1589.\n\nSimilarly, sin((628 + 1)/2) = sin(629 / 2) = sin(314.5). Let me compute 314.5 radians.\n\nSimilarly, 314.5 - 50*2π ≈ 314.5 - 314.159 ≈ 0.341 radians. Therefore, sin(314.5) ≈ sin(0.341) ≈ 0.334.\n\nTherefore, the product sin(314) * sin(314.5) ≈ (-0.1589)(0.334) ≈ -0.0530. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794 gives a_n ≈ -0.0530 / 0.4794 ≈ -0.1105 < 0. Therefore, a_628 < 0.\n\nNow check a_629:\n\nCompute sin(629 / 2) = sin(314.5). As above, sin(314.5) ≈ 0.334.\n\nsin((629 + 1)/2) = sin(630 / 2) = sin(315). 315 radians is 315 - 50*2π ≈ 315 - 314.159 ≈ 0.841 radians. sin(315) ≈ sin(0.841) ≈ 0.743. Therefore, the product sin(314.5) * sin(315) ≈ 0.334 * 0.743 ≈ 0.248. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794 gives a_629 ≈ 0.248 / 0.4794 ≈ 0.517 > 0. Therefore, a_629 > 0. Therefore, n = 628 is indeed the term where a_n < 0, and n = 629 is positive. Therefore, the 100th term is 628.\n\nHowever, let me check whether there could be another term between, say, m = 100 and m = ... Wait, but according to our earlier logic, each m corresponds to exactly one n. Therefore, the 100th term is floor(200π) = 628. However, let me check with m = 100, whether floor(200π) is indeed the correct term.\n\nBut to be 100% sure, let me check for m = 1 to m = 4, we had exactly one term each. For m = 1, n = 6; m = 2, n = 12; m = 3, n = 18; m = 4, n = 25; m = 5, n = 31; m = 6, n = 37; etc. Each time, floor(2mπ). Therefore, if this pattern continues, then for m = 100, it's floor(200π) = 628. However, let me check for m = 7, floor(14π) ≈ 43.98 → 43. Let me check a_43:\n\nsin(43/2) = sin(21.5). 21.5 radians. 21.5 / (2π) ≈ 3.42. Subtract 3*2π = 18.849. 21.5 - 18.849 ≈ 2.651 radians. sin(2.651) ≈ sin(π - 0.490) ≈ sin(0.490) ≈ 0.470. Positive.\n\nsin(44/2) = sin(22). 22 radians. 22 - 3*2π ≈ 22 - 18.849 ≈ 3.151 radians. sin(3.151) ≈ sin(π + 0.0094) ≈ -sin(0.0094) ≈ -0.0094. Therefore, sin(22) ≈ -0.0094. Therefore, product sin(21.5) * sin(22) ≈ 0.470 * (-0.0094) ≈ -0.0044. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794 gives a_43 ≈ -0.0092 < 0. Therefore, a_43 is negative. Therefore, n = 43 is the 7th term. Correct. Therefore, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, trusting this pattern, the 100th term is floor(200π) = 628. However, to ensure that there isn't an off-by-one error, let me think: when m increases by 1, n increases by approximately 6.28, so floor(2mπ). However, is the first term m=1 corresponds to n=6, which is floor(2π) = 6. So the mapping is direct. Therefore, the 100th term is floor(2*100π) = floor(200π) = 628.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me think about how many solutions there are to a_n < 0 for n up to some N. According to our previous analysis, approximately every 2π terms, there is one n where a_n < 0. Therefore, the number of such terms up to N is roughly N/(2π). Therefore, solving N/(2π) = 100 gives N ≈ 200π ≈ 628.318. Therefore, the 100th term is around 628. Since the actual value is slightly less than 628.318, floor(628.318) = 628, which would be the 100th term. Therefore, this corroborates the previous result.\n\nHowever, to be absolutely thorough, let me check for a slightly higher m. Let me take m = 10. Then floor(20π) ≈ 62.83 → 62. Let me check if a_62 < 0 and a_63 ≥ 0?\n\nCompute using the formula:\n\nFor n = 62:\n\nsin(62/2) = sin(31). 31 radians. 31 / (2π) ≈ 4.93. Subtract 4*2π = 25.132. 31 - 25.132 ≈ 5.868 radians. sin(5.868) ≈ sin(5.868 - 2π) ≈ sin(5.868 - 6.283) ≈ sin(-0.415) ≈ -sin(0.415) ≈ -0.402.\n\nsin(63/2) = sin(31.5). 31.5 radians. Subtract 5*2π = 31.415. 31.5 - 31.415 ≈ 0.085 radians. sin(0.085) ≈ 0.0848. Therefore, product sin(31)*sin(31.5) ≈ (-0.402)(0.0848) ≈ -0.0341. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794 gives a_62 ≈ -0.071 ≼ 0. So a_62 < 0.\n\nFor n = 63:\n\nsin(63/2) = sin(31.5) ≈ 0.0848 as above.\n\nsin(64/2) = sin(32). 32 radians. 32 - 5*2π ≈ 32 - 31.415 ≈ 0.585 radians. sin(0.585) ≈ 0.552. Therefore, product sin(31.5)*sin(32) ≈ 0.0848 * 0.552 ≈ 0.0468. Divided by sin(1/2) ≈ 0.4794 gives a_63 ≈ 0.0976 > 0. Therefore, a_63 > 0. Therefore, n = 62 is the 10th term. And floor(20π) ≈ 62.83 → 62. Correct. Therefore, the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the 100th term is floor(200π) = 628. However, to make sure, let me compute 200π with more decimal precision and check the floor.\n\nπ ≈ 3.14159265358979323846...\n\n200π ≈ 628.318530717958647692525... So floor(200π) = 628. Therefore, the answer is 628.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the index of the 100th term for which a_n < 0\". But according to our analysis, the first term is n = 6, second n = 12, third n = 18, fourth n = 25,... So the indices are 6, 12, 18, 25, 31, 37,... So they are not all multiples of 6, but approximately every 6.28. Therefore, the 100th term is 628. However, to be 100% sure, perhaps there is a correction term?\n\nWait, let me think again. The number of solutions to a_n < 0 for n ≤ N is approximately N/(2π). Therefore, to have 100 solutions, we need N ≈ 200π. However, because of the floor function, the exact value could be floor(200π) or floor(200π) + 1? But our previous check for m = 10 showed that floor(2mπ) gives the exact term. Therefore, likely floor(200π) is correct. However, let me think about the fractional part of 200π.\n\nSince 200π ≈ 628.3185..., the fractional part is ~0.3185. Therefore, the next term would be at m = 101, which would be floor(202π) ≈ floor(634.66...) = 634. The difference between floor(202π) and floor(200π) is 634 - 628 = 6. Therefore, between m = 100 and m = 101, n increases by 6. Therefore, there are no missing terms. Therefore, the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we model the number of solutions up to n as approximately n/(2π), then solving n/(2π) = 100 gives n ≈ 200π ≈ 628.318. Therefore, the 100th solution is the integer part, 628. However, there's a possibility that due to the oscillations in the sine function, there could be an extra term or missing term. However, our detailed analysis for small m shows that floor(2mπ) gives the correct n for each m. Therefore, trusting this, the answer is 628.\n\nBut to be 100% sure, perhaps I should check for m = 100, whether there is indeed an n = 628 where a_n < 0, and that there are exactly 100 such terms before that. However, verifying this manually would be tedious, but given the consistency in smaller m's, it's highly probable.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the index of the 100th term for which a_n < 0 is 628.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{628}\n</think>"}
