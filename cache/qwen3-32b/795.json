Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the robot is moving at a constant speed. It takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. Then, moving at the same speed, it takes 90 seconds to go through this hallway. I need to find the length of the hallway in meters. \n\nHmm, right. So, maybe I should first find out the speed of the robot. If I can find the speed, then I can use that to calculate the distance for the hallway. \n\nLet me recall the formula for speed. Speed is distance divided by time. So, speed = distance / time. \n\nThe robot takes 2.5 hours to go 1 kilometer. Let me write that down. \n\nSpeed = 1 kilometer / 2.5 hours. \n\nBut wait, the hallway's time is given in seconds, and the answer needs to be in meters. Maybe I should convert all the units to be consistent. Let me think. \n\nFirst, let me compute the speed in kilometers per hour, and then maybe convert it to meters per second because the hallway's time is in seconds. \n\nSo, 1 kilometer divided by 2.5 hours. Let me calculate that. \n\n1 divided by 2.5 is 0.4. So, the speed is 0.4 kilometers per hour. \n\nBut 0.4 kilometers per hour seems slow. Let me check. If a robot takes 2.5 hours to go 1 kilometer, then in one hour, it goes 1 divided by 2.5 kilometers. Yes, that's 0.4 km/h. \n\nAlternatively, maybe converting to meters per second would make more sense for the hallway problem. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, convert 0.4 kilometers per hour to meters per second. \n\n1 kilometer is 1000 meters, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. \n\nSo, 0.4 km/h is equal to 0.4 * 1000 meters per hour, which is 400 meters per hour. Then, divide by 3600 seconds to get meters per second. \n\nSo, 400 / 3600. Let me compute that. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 40: 10 / 90, which is 1/9. Wait, 400 divided by 3600 is 0.111... meters per second? Let me check:\n\n3600 seconds in an hour. So 400 meters per hour divided by 3600 seconds is 400/3600 m/s. Simplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 400? No, maybe divide numerator and denominator by 200: 2 / 18, then divide by 2 again: 1 / 9. So yes, 1/9 m/s. Which is approximately 0.111 m/s. \n\nOkay, so the robot's speed is 1/9 meters per second. \n\nNow, the robot takes 90 seconds to go through the hallway. So, distance is speed multiplied by time. \n\nSo, distance = speed * time. \n\nSo, distance = (1/9 m/s) * 90 seconds. \n\nLet me calculate that. 90 divided by 9 is 10. So, 10 meters. \n\nWait, so the hallway is 10 meters long? That seems straightforward. Let me verify my steps again. \n\nOriginal speed: 1 km in 2.5 hours. Convert that to m/s:\n\n1 km = 1000 m. 2.5 hours = 2.5 * 3600 seconds. Let me compute that. 2.5 * 3600. 2 * 3600 = 7200, 0.5 * 3600 = 1800, so total 7200 + 1800 = 9000 seconds. \n\nSo the robot takes 9000 seconds to go 1000 meters. Therefore, speed is 1000 / 9000 m/s = 1/9 m/s. Yep, same result. \n\nThen, time for hallway is 90 seconds. Multiply speed (1/9 m/s) by time (90 s): 1/9 * 90 = 10 meters. \n\nTherefore, the hallway is 10 meters long. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe there's a mistake in unit conversion. \n\nAlternatively, I can use ratios. \n\nIf the robot takes 2.5 hours for 1 km, then how much distance does it cover in 90 seconds?\n\nFirst, convert 2.5 hours to seconds. As before, 2.5 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 9000 seconds. \n\nSo, 9000 seconds corresponds to 1 km. Therefore, 90 seconds corresponds to (90 / 9000) km. \n\nCompute 90 / 9000 = 1 / 100. \n\nSo, 1/100 km. Convert that to meters. 1 km is 1000 meters, so 1/100 km is 10 meters. \n\nSame answer. So, that's a good check. \n\nTherefore, the hallway is 10 meters long. \n\nAlternatively, another approach. \n\nFirst, find the speed in km per second, then multiply by time in seconds to get km, then convert to meters. \n\nSpeed is 1 km / 2.5 hours. Let me convert hours to seconds. \n\n2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 minutes = 150 minutes. 150 minutes * 60 seconds = 9000 seconds, as before. \n\nSo speed is 1 km / 9000 seconds. \n\nTherefore, in 90 seconds, distance is (1 km / 9000 seconds) * 90 seconds = 90 / 9000 km = 0.01 km. \n\nConvert 0.01 km to meters: 0.01 * 1000 = 10 meters. \n\nSame answer again. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the hallway is 10 meters long. \n\nI think that's solid. All different approaches lead to 10 meters. \n\nBut let me think if there's any chance I misread the question. \n\n\"A robot moving forward at a constant speed takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. Moving forward at this same constant speed, it takes the robot 90 seconds to travel the length of a particular hallway. How many meters long is the hallway?\"\n\nNo, the question seems straightforward. The key was converting the time or the speed into compatible units. \n\nAnother way: Let's compute the speed in km per second, then multiply by 90 seconds and convert to meters. \n\nBut that's similar to previous steps. \n\nAlternatively, convert 90 seconds to hours, then multiply by speed in km per hour. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nFirst, speed is 0.4 km/h. \n\nTime is 90 seconds. Let me convert 90 seconds to hours. \n\n90 seconds divided by 3600 seconds per hour is 90 / 3600 = 9 / 360 = 1 / 40 hours. \n\nSo, time is 1/40 hours. \n\nMultiply by speed 0.4 km/h: 0.4 * (1/40) km. \n\n0.4 divided by 40 is 0.01 km. \n\nConvert 0.01 km to meters: 0.01 * 1000 = 10 meters. \n\nSame answer again! \n\nSo, all methods converge to 10 meters. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the hallway is 10 meters long. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe hallway is \\boxed{10} meters long.\n</think>"}
