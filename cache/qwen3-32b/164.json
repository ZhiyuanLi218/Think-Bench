First, I need to understand the problem. Juan has stamps organized by country and decade. The prices depend on the country: Brazil and France are 6 cents each, Peru is 4 cents each, and Spain is 5 cents each. The Asymptote code draws a table, which I need to interpret.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, there's a grid. The vertical lines divide the countries and decades. The labels on the left are countries: Brazil, France, Peru, Spain. Then, the decades are 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. Each country has numbers for each decade. For example, under the 50s column, Brazil has 4 stamps, France has 8, Peru has 6, Spain has 3. Similarly for other decades.\n\nThe question is about the 70s stamps. So I need to find the average price of stamps issued in the 70s. To compute the average price, I need the total cost of all 70s stamps divided by the total number of 70s stamps.\n\nFirst, let me get the number of stamps for each country in the 70s. From the Asymptote code description:\n\nFor the 70s column (which is the third column after 50s and 60s; since 50s is columns 0-6, 60s 6-9, 70s 9-12? Wait, maybe I need to parse the Asymptote code more carefully.\n\nWait, the Asymptote code draws vertical lines at x=0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. The horizontal lines from y=0 to 5. Then labels for decades: \"50s\" at (7.5, 4.5), which is between x=6 and 9, so that's the 50s column. Then \"60s\" at (10.5, 4.5), between 9 and 12. Wait, no, 10.5 is between 9 and 12? Wait, 9 to 12 is 3 units, so 9.5 to 12? Wait, maybe the columns are:\n\nFrom x=0 to 6: Country labels (Brazil, France, Peru, Spain). Then the decades start at x=6. The first decade column is from x=6 to 9 (since there's a line at x=6 and x=9). Then next is x=9 to 12, then 12 to 15, then 15 to 18. The labels for decades are:\n\n\"50s\" at (7.5, ...), which is in the column between 6 and 9. Then \"60s\" at 10.5, between 9 and 12. Then \"70s\" at 13.5, between 12 and 15. Then \"80s\" at 16.5, between 15 and 18. So the 70s column is between x=12 and 15. The numbers in that column are:\n\nFor Brazil (y=3.5): 12\n\nFrance (y=2.5): 12\n\nPeru (y=1.5): 6\n\nSpain (y=0.5): 13\n\nSo in the 70s, Juan has:\n\nBrazil: 12 stamps\n\nFrance: 12 stamps\n\nPeru: 6 stamps\n\nSpain: 13 stamps\n\nTotal number of 70s stamps is 12 + 12 + 6 + 13. Let me calculate that: 12 + 12 is 24, 6 +13 is 19, so total is 24 + 19 = 43 stamps.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, we need to multiply each country's number of stamps by their respective price.\n\nPrices:\n\nBrazil: 6 cents each\n\nFrance: 6 cents each\n\nPeru: 4 cents each\n\nSpain: 5 cents each\n\nSo total cost for 70s stamps:\n\nBrazil: 12 * 6 = 72 cents\n\nFrance: 12 * 6 = 72 cents\n\nPeru: 6 * 4 = 24 cents\n\nSpain: 13 * 5 = 65 cents\n\nAdding these up: 72 + 72 + 24 + 65.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n72 + 72 = 144\n\n144 + 24 = 168\n\n168 + 65 = 233 cents total.\n\nTherefore, average price is total cost divided by total number of stamps:\n\n233 cents / 43 stamps ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute that division. 233 divided by 43.\n\nFirst, 43*5 = 215. 233 - 215 = 18. So 5 + 18/43 ≈ 5.4186...\n\nSince the question asks for the average price rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent, so we need to calculate 233 / 43 ≈ 5.4186... So the decimal is approximately 5.4186 cents. Rounded to the nearest tenth: look at the hundredth place, which is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we round down. So 5.4 cents.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait 233 divided by 43. Let me check my division again because 43*5 = 215. 233 - 215 is 18. So 18/43 ≈ 0.4186. So total is 5.4186... So 5.4186 rounded to the nearest tenth: tenths place is 4, hundredths is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we keep it at 5.4. Therefore, the average price is 5.4 cents.\n\nBut let me verify my numbers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting or multiplying.\n\nNumber of stamps in 70s:\n\nBrazil: 12\n\nFrance: 12\n\nPeru: 6\n\nSpain: 13\n\nTotal: 12 + 12 + 6 +13. Let me add again: 12 +12 is 24, 6 +13 is 19, 24 +19 is 43. Correct.\n\nTotal cost:\n\nBrazil: 12 * 6. Brazil is 6 cents each. 12 *6=72. Correct.\n\nFrance same as Brazil, 12*6=72. Correct.\n\nPeru: 6 stamps * 4 cents = 24. Correct.\n\nSpain: 13 * 5. 10*5=50, 3*5=15, total 65. Correct.\n\nTotal cost: 72 +72 +24 +65. 72+72=144, 144+24=168, 168+65=233. Correct.\n\nSo 233 divided by 43. Let me check with another method. Let me do 43*5.4 = 43*5 + 43*0.4 = 215 + 17.2 = 232.2. So 5.4 is 232.2. The actual total is 233. The difference is 233 - 232.2 = 0.8. So 0.8 /43 ≈ 0.0186. Therefore, 5.4 + 0.0186 ≈ 5.4186. So yes, approximately 5.4186, which rounds to 5.4 cents.\n\nTherefore, the average price is 5.4 cents.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check once again if I have the correct numbers for the 70s. The Asymptote code labels for the 70s column (which is between x=12 and 15) are labeled at (13.5, 4.5) as \"70s\". Then the numbers:\n\nFor Brazil (which is at y=3.5): label is \"12\", so Brazil 70s: 12\n\nFrance (y=2.5): \"12\"\n\nPeru (y=1.5): \"6\"\n\nSpain (y=0.5): \"13\"\n\nYes, that's correct. So numbers are correct. Prices are correct. So calculations are correct. So answer is 5.4 cents.\n\nBut let me check once more if I didn't mix up the decades. The 70s column is third from the left after the country column? The country column is from x=0 to 6? Wait, the Asymptote code draws vertical lines at 0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. The first column (x=0 to 6) is labeled \"Country\" with Brazil, France, Peru, Spain. Then the next columns are 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. So:\n\n- 50s: x=6 to 9\n\n- 60s: x=9 to 12\n\n- 70s: x=12 to 15\n\n- 80s: x=15 to 18\n\nTherefore, for the 70s column (x=12 to 15), the numbers are:\n\nBrazil: 12\n\nFrance: 12\n\nPeru: 6\n\nSpain: 13\n\nYes, as given. So calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the price for Spain? The problem says:\n\n\"Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each.\" Yes, that's correct. So Spain is 5 cents. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, total cost 233 cents for 43 stamps. 233 divided by 43. Let me do decimal division properly.\n\nCompute 233 ÷ 43.\n\n43 goes into 233 five times (5*43=215), subtract 215 from 233, get 18. Bring down a zero: 180.\n\n43 goes into 180 four times (4*43=172), subtract from 180: 8. Bring down a zero: 80.\n\n43 goes into 80 once (1*43=43), subtract: 37. Bring down a zero: 370.\n\n43 goes into 370 eight times (8*43=344), subtract: 26. Bring down a zero: 260.\n\n43 goes into 260 six times (6*43=258), subtract: 2. So so far we have 5.4186... So approximately 5.4186 cents. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 5.4 cents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.4 cents.\n\nBut let me check once more if I didn't miscalculate the total cost. Maybe I added wrong?\n\nBrazil: 12 * 6 = 72\n\nFrance: 12 * 6 = 72\n\nPeru: 6 * 4 = 24\n\nSpain: 13 * 5 = 65\n\nTotal: 72 + 72 is 144. 144 + 24 is 168. 168 + 65 is 233. Correct.\n\nYes. So 233 divided by 43 is indeed approximately 5.418... So 5.4 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Therefore, the answer is 5.4 cents.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average price of his 70's stamps is \\boxed{5.4} cents.\n</think>"}
