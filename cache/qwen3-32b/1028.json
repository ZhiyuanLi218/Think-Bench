The key elements involve the transformation of a \"bitter spring\" into **blue vitriol**, and the subsequent conversion of blue vitriol into **copper** using an **iron cauldron**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: The chemical formula of blue vitriol is $\\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$**\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Blue vitriol** is the traditional name for **copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate**, which has the chemical formula:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CuSO_4 \\cdot 5H_2O}\n$$\n\nThe **anhydrous** form of copper sulfate is $\\mathrm{CuSO_4}$, but it is **white** in color and not the same as the **blue** crystalline form. The **blue color** comes from the **water of crystallization**, which gives the compound its characteristic **pentahydrate** structure.\n\nThus, the **correct** chemical formula for blue vitriol is **not** simply $\\mathrm{CuSO_4}$, but **$\\mathrm{CuSO_4 \\cdot 5H_2O}$**. Therefore, **Option A is factually incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Blue vitriol can be used as a raw material for hydrometallurgical copper**\n\nThis statement is **correct**.\n\nHydrometallurgy involves the extraction of metals using aqueous solutions. Copper sulfate is a common reagent in such processes. For example, copper can be extracted via **electrolysis** of copper sulfate solution or via **displacement** using a more reactive metal (like iron). Thus, blue vitriol (copper sulfate) is indeed a **raw material** in hydrometallurgical processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: \"Boiling it becomes blue vitriol\" is a process of concentration and crystallization**\n\nThis statement is **correct**.\n\nThe passage describes boiling the \"bitter spring\" to obtain blue vitriol. This is a **crystallization process** where the water evaporates, and the dissolved copper sulfate crystallizes out of the solution in its **pentahydrate form**. This is a well-known method of obtaining crystals from a saturated solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: \"Boiling blue vitriol with an iron cauldron, after a long time it also turns into copper\" involved a displacement reaction**\n\nThis statement is **correct**.\n\nThe process described is a **displacement reaction** between **iron** and **copper(II) sulfate**:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Fe + CuSO_4 \\rightarrow FeSO_4 + Cu}\n$$\n\nIn this reaction, iron displaces copper from the solution, forming **iron(II) sulfate** and **copper metal**. This is a classic example of a **single displacement reaction**, and the use of an **iron cauldron** would allow the iron to react with the copper sulfate solution.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about a passage from Shen Kuo's \"Dream Pool Essays\" regarding a process involving a bitter spring in Yanshan, Xinzhou. The key points mentioned are boiling the water to get blue vitriol, then refining blue vitriol to get copper, and also that boiling blue vitriol in an iron cauldron turns it into copper over time. The question asks which of the statements (A to D) is incorrect.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these options is saying and check their accuracy based on the information given and my knowledge of chemistry.\n\nStarting with option A: The chemical formula of blue vitriol is CuSO4. Blue vitriol is another name for copper(II) sulfate. The formula for copper(II) sulfate is indeed CuSO4. However, when it's in its pentahydrate form (which is the common crystalline form), it's CuSO4·5H2O. But the question just says the chemical formula, not specifying the hydrate. However, in many contexts, blue vitriol refers to the pentahydrate because that's the blue crystalline form. But the anhydrous form is white. Wait, but the passage mentions that boiling the water forms blue vitriol. If blue vitriol is CuSO4·5H2O, then when you boil the water, you might first get a solution of copper sulfate, and upon cooling, it crystallizes as the pentahydrate. So maybe A is correct? Or is the formula just CuSO4? Hmm. The formula of blue vitriol is typically CuSO4·5H2O. So if option A says CuSO4 without the water, is that incorrect? Because the formula would need to include the water of crystallization. But maybe in the context of the question, they consider the anhydrous form as blue vitriol? Wait, no. Blue vitriol is the blue crystalline form, which is the pentahydrate. The anhydrous form is white. So if option A is CuSO4, then that's incorrect because it's missing the water. So A would be incorrect. But I need to check the options again. The options are (A) The chemical formula of blue vitriol is CuSO4. So if blue vitriol is the pentahydrate, then this is incorrect. But maybe in some contexts, the formula is written as CuSO4 for simplicity, even though it's actually the hydrate. But in standard chemistry, blue vitriol is CuSO4·5H2O. So A would be incorrect. But I need to check the other options too.\n\nOption B: Blue vitriol can be used as a raw material for hydrometallurgical copper. Hydrometallurgical processes involve using aqueous solutions to extract metals from their ores. If blue vitriol is copper sulfate, then yes, you can use it in hydrometallurgy. For example, copper can be extracted via electrolysis of copper sulfate solution. Or by displacement with a more reactive metal. So B seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Boiling it becomes blue vitriol\" is a process of concentration and crystallization. The original passage says that when the water is boiled, it becomes blue vitriol. So boiling the water (the bitter spring) would evaporate the water, concentrating the solution until copper sulfate crystals form. So yes, that's concentration and crystallization. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: \"Boiling blue vitriol with an iron cauldron, after a long time it also turns into copper\" involved a displacement reaction. The reaction here is between iron and copper sulfate. Iron is more reactive than copper, so it displaces copper from the solution: Fe + CuSO4 → FeSO4 + Cu. This is a single displacement reaction. So D is correct.\n\nSo if A is incorrect because blue vitriol is CuSO4·5H2O, not just CuSO4, then the answer is A. But I need to confirm. Let me check again. The term \"blue vitriol\" is commonly known as copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, with the formula CuSO4·5H2O. The anhydrous form is white. So if the formula is given as CuSO4, that's the anhydrous form. However, in the process described, when the water is boiled, it forms blue vitriol. If the original water is a solution of copper sulfate, boiling it would lead to the formation of the pentahydrate crystals. Therefore, the formula of blue vitriol is CuSO4·5H2O, so option A is incorrect because it's missing the water. Therefore, the incorrect statement is option A.\n</think>"}
