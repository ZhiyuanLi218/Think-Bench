Their crystal structures are similar to **diamond**, which is a **covalent network solid** where each atom is bonded to four neighbors in a tetrahedral geometry. In the case of AlN and GaN, the atoms alternate between nitrogen (N) and either aluminum (Al) or gallium (Ga), respectively. These materials typically adopt the **zinc blende** or **wurtzite** structure, both of which are tetrahedral and similar in concept to the diamond structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Option Analysis**\n\n#### **(A) The melting point of GaN is higher than that of AlN.**\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**. The **melting point** of a compound is largely determined by the **strength of the covalent bonds** in its crystal lattice. Since **Al is smaller in size** than Ga, the **Al–N bond** is **shorter and stronger** than the Ga–N bond. Therefore, **AlN has a higher melting point** than GaN.\n\n- **AlN melting point**: ~2200°C  \n- **GaN melting point**: ~1700°C  \n\nThus, the claim in option A is **false**.\n\n---\n\n#### **(B) All chemical bonds in the crystal are polar bonds.**\n\nThis is **correct**. In both AlN and GaN, nitrogen is more electronegative than aluminum or gallium, resulting in **polar covalent bonds**. Since all bonds in the crystal are between N and either Al or Ga, and all these bonds are polar, this statement is accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **(C) All atoms in the crystal undergo sp³ hybridization.**\n\nThis is **correct**. In the **tetrahedral geometry** of the crystal structure (zinc blende or wurtzite), each atom is bonded to four neighbors, which is characteristic of **sp³ hybridization**. Therefore, **all atoms (N, Al, Ga)** in the crystal are sp³ hybridized.\n\n---\n\n#### **(D) The coordination number of all atoms in the crystal is the same.**\n\nThis is **correct**. In the crystal structure, each atom (whether N, Al, or Ga) is bonded to four neighbors, meaning the **coordination number is 4 for all atoms**. This is consistent with the tetrahedral arrangement of the structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAmong all the options, **only option A** makes an incorrect claim about the **melting point** of GaN being higher than that of AlN. The actual data and reasoning show the opposite to be true.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about AIN and GaN, which are third-generation semiconductor materials. Their bonding structures are similar to diamond. So, first, I need to recall what the diamond structure looks like. Diamond is a covalent network solid where each carbon atom is bonded to four others in a tetrahedral arrangement. So, the structure is a face-centered cubic lattice with each atom connected to four neighbors.\n\nNow, the question says that in these materials (AIN and GaN), there are only N-Al bonds and N-Ga bonds. So, the bonding is similar to diamond, but with alternating atoms. In diamond, it's all carbon, but here it's alternating nitrogen and either aluminum or gallium. So, each nitrogen is bonded to either aluminum or gallium, and vice versa. \n\nThe options given are about the incorrect statement. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The melting point of GaN is higher than that of AlN. Hmm. Melting point depends on the strength of the bonds in the crystal. Since Ga is below Al in the periodic table, the atomic size of Ga is larger than Al. In general, for similar compounds, the melting point can depend on the bond strength. For example, in the nitrides, AlN has a higher melting point than GaN? Wait, I need to think about this. The bond strength between N and Al versus N and Ga. Since Al is smaller, the bond between N and Al might be stronger (shorter bond length, higher bond energy), leading to a higher melting point for AlN compared to GaN. So if option A says GaN has higher melting point than AlN, that would be incorrect. So A is incorrect? But I need to verify this. Let me check some data. From what I remember, AlN has a melting point around 2200°C, GaN around 1700°C. So indeed, AlN has a higher melting point. Therefore, option A is incorrect. So A is the incorrect statement. But wait, the question is asking which statement is incorrect. So if A is incorrect, then A is the answer. But let me check the other options first to make sure.\n\nOption B: All chemical bonds in the crystal are polar bonds. In GaN and AlN, the bonds are between N and Al or Ga. Since N is more electronegative than both Al and Ga, the bonds should be polar covalent. So all bonds in the crystal are polar. So B is correct. Therefore, B is not the incorrect statement.\n\nOption C: All atoms in the crystal undergo sp³ hybridization. In the diamond structure, each carbon is sp³ hybridized. Since the structure of AIN and GaN is similar to diamond, each atom (N, Al, Ga) should also be sp³ hybridized. Because in diamond, each atom forms four bonds in a tetrahedral geometry, which is sp³ hybridization. So if the structure is similar, then all atoms are sp³ hybridized. So C is correct. Therefore, C is not the incorrect statement.\n\nOption D: The coordination number of all atoms in the crystal is the same. In diamond structure, each carbon is bonded to four others, so coordination number 4. Similarly, in AIN and GaN, each atom (N, Al, Ga) would be bonded to four neighbors. For example, each N is bonded to four Al or Ga atoms, and each Al or Ga is bonded to four N atoms. Therefore, the coordination number for all atoms is 4. So D is correct. Therefore, D is not the incorrect statement.\n\nSo the incorrect statement is option A. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm again about the melting points. If GaN has a lower melting point than AlN, then option A is incorrect. So if the question says that option A is incorrect, then the answer is A. But I need to make sure that the reasoning is correct. Since Al is smaller than Ga, Al-N bonds are shorter and stronger. Therefore, AlN has a higher melting point. So A is incorrect. So the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possibility. For example, sometimes in some compounds, the melting point can be influenced by other factors. But in the case of nitrides with similar structure, the bond strength is the main factor. Since Al is more electronegative than Ga (Al is 1.5 vs Ga 1.6?), wait, actually Ga's electronegativity is slightly higher than Al? Wait, no, according to the Pauling scale, Al is about 1.61, Ga is about 1.81. So Ga is more electronegative than Al. Wait, so N's electronegativity is higher than both. So in AlN, the difference between Al (1.61) and N (3.04) is about 1.43. In GaN, Ga (1.81) and N (3.04) is 1.23. So the difference is smaller in GaN, so the bond is less polar. But does that affect the melting point? The melting point is more about bond strength. The bond strength in AlN vs GaN. Since Al is smaller, the bond length is shorter, leading to stronger bonds. So even though the electronegativity difference is larger in AlN, the bond strength is higher because of the smaller size. Therefore, AlN has higher melting point. Therefore, option A is incorrect. So the answer is A.\n\nAnother point: the question says that their bonding structures are similar to diamond. So in diamond, each atom is tetrahedrally bonded. So in AIN and GaN, each atom is bonded to four others. But in AIN, the atoms are N and Al, and in GaN, N and Ga. So the structure is similar to diamond, which is a zinc blende structure? Wait, actually, the diamond structure is a specific type of crystal structure where all atoms are the same. The zinc blende structure is similar but with two different atoms (like in GaAs). Wait, the problem says their bonding structures are similar to diamond. So maybe they have the zinc blende structure? Or is it the same as diamond? Wait, the diamond cubic structure is when all atoms are the same. The zinc blende structure is a similar arrangement but with two different atoms (A and B) in a face-centered cubic lattice. So if the problem says their structure is similar to diamond, maybe it's the zinc blende structure. In that case, each atom (N, Al, Ga) is in a tetrahedral arrangement, so sp³ hybridization. So that's consistent with option C. So all atoms are sp³ hybridized. So option C is correct. \n\nSo the incorrect statement is A. Therefore, the answer is A.\n</think>"}
