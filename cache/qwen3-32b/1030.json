Bond Strength and Acid Strength**\n\nIn general, the **weaker the H–X bond**, the **stronger the acid**, because the H⁺ ion can be released more easily. Bond strength decreases as the size of the atom increases (i.e., as we go down a group in the periodic table). This is due to the increased distance between the bonding electrons and the nucleus, making the bond longer and weaker.\n\n- **H–I** is weaker than **H–Br**, which is weaker than **H–Cl**, and so on.\n- **H–S** is weaker than **H–O** because sulfur is larger and less electronegative than oxygen.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Electronegativity and Conjugate Base Stability**\n\nThe **electronegativity** of the atom bonded to hydrogen influences the polarity of the bond. A more electronegative atom pulls electron density away from hydrogen, making the H⁺ more likely to dissociate. Additionally, the **stability of the conjugate base** plays a role:\n- A **larger atom** can better stabilize a negative charge due to greater dispersion of electron density.\n- For example, **I⁻** is more stable than **Br⁻**, which is more stable than **S²⁻**, and so on.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Let me start by recalling what makes an acid strong. I remember that in binary acids (which are acids composed of hydrogen and another element), the strength depends on the bond strength between the hydrogen and the other atom, as well as the stability of the conjugate base.\n\nFirst, bond strength: the weaker the bond between H and the other atom, the easier it is for the H+ to be released, making the acid stronger. So, if the bond is weaker, the acid is stronger. Now, bond strength generally decreases as the size of the atom increases because larger atoms have bonds that are longer and thus weaker. For example, in the halogen group (like F, Cl, Br, I), the bond strength decreases as you go down the group because the atoms get larger. So HF has the strongest bond, then HCl, then HBr, then HI. But wait, HF is actually a weak acid, which seems contradictory. Oh, right, because fluorine is highly electronegative, the bond is strong, but the conjugate base F- is unstable due to its small size. However, for the heavier halogens (Cl, Br, I), the bond strength decreases more significantly, so even though their electronegativity is lower, the bond strength is the main factor. So HI is a stronger acid than HBr, which is stronger than HCl, and HF is the weakest among them. So in this case, the options are HBr and HI. So HI should be stronger than HBr.\n\nNow the other options are H2O and H2S. Let me think about those. H2O is water, which is a very weak acid. H2S is hydrogen sulfide, which is a bit stronger than water. Comparing H2O and H2S, the bond strength between H and O versus H and S. Sulfur is larger than oxygen, so the H-S bond is longer and weaker than the H-O bond. Therefore, H2S should be a stronger acid than H2O. But how does H2S compare to HBr or HI?\n\nWait, HBr and HI are from different groups. Let me consider the periodic trends. For binary acids, moving across a period (same row in periodic table), acidity increases with increasing electronegativity because the bond polarity increases, making it easier to release H+. For example, in the second period, the order is CH4 < NH3 < H2O < HF. But moving down a group, like from F to I, the bond strength is the dominant factor, so HI is stronger than HBr, which is stronger than HCl, etc.\n\nNow H2S is in the third period, group 16. HBr is in the fourth period, group 17. Wait, maybe I need to compare the bond strengths and electronegativities between these. Electronegativity of H is about 2.1, O is 3.5, S is 2.5, Br is 2.8, I is 2.5. So in H2O, the O is more electronegative than S in H2S. But the bond strength for H-O is stronger than H-S because O is smaller. So H2O is less acidic than H2S because the bond is stronger, making it harder to release H+. So H2S is more acidic than H2O.\n\nNow comparing H2S with HBr. HBr is H bonded to Br, which is in group 17, period 4. S is in group 16, period 3. So Br is more electronegative than S. But bond strength? The H-Br bond is weaker than H-S? Wait, S is in period 3, Br is in period 4. So atomic size: S is smaller than Br. Wait, no, S is in period 3, Br is in period 4. So Br is larger than S. Therefore, the H-Br bond length is longer than H-S? Wait, H is bonded to Br (larger atom) versus H bonded to S (smaller than Br). So H-S bond is shorter and stronger than H-Br? Wait, no. Let me think again. If Br is larger than S, then H-Br bond is longer than H-S bond? Wait, S is in period 3, same period as Cl. Br is in period 4. So S has a smaller atomic radius than Br. Therefore, the H-S bond is shorter and stronger than H-Br? Wait, but H2S is H bonded to S, and HBr is H bonded to Br. Since Br is larger than S, the H-Br bond is longer and weaker than H-S. Wait, but earlier I thought H2S is a stronger acid than H2O because H-S bond is weaker. So if H-Br bond is weaker than H-S, then HBr would be a stronger acid than H2S? Because weaker bond means easier to release H+.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline:\n\n- For the same period, acidity increases with electronegativity (e.g., H2O < H2S because S is more electronegative than O? Wait, no. Wait O is more electronegative than S. Wait, electronegativity decreases down the group. O is more electronegative than S. So H2O would have a more polar bond than H2S. But bond strength is also a factor. The H-O bond is stronger than H-S. So in this case, the bond strength is the dominant factor, so H2S is more acidic than H2O.\n\nNow comparing H2S with HBr. HBr is H bonded to Br. Br is more electronegative than S (Br is 2.8 vs S is 2.5). Also, Br is larger than S. So the bond strength: H-Br vs H-S. Which is stronger? Since Br is larger than S, the bond length of H-Br is longer than H-S? Wait, S is in period 3, Br is in period 4. So the size of Br is larger than S. Therefore, the H-Br bond is longer than H-S bond. A longer bond is weaker. Therefore, H-Br bond is weaker than H-S bond. Wait, but if that's the case, then HBr would be a stronger acid than H2S because the bond is weaker. But wait, Br is more electronegative than S, which would help stabilize the conjugate base (Br- vs S^2-). But if the bond is weaker, that also helps. So if HBr has a weaker bond than H2S, then HBr would be a stronger acid. So HBr is stronger than H2S. Then HI is even weaker in bond strength than HBr (since I is larger than Br), so HI would be a stronger acid than HBr. Therefore, the order would be HI > HBr > H2S > H2O. Therefore, the strongest acid among the options is HI (option D).\n\nWait, but I need to confirm. Let me check the actual acid strengths. From what I remember, the strength of binary acids increases as you go down the group. So HF < HCl < HBr < HI. So HI is the strongest among those. Then for the hydrides in group 16: H2O is weaker than H2S, which is weaker than H2Se, etc. So H2S is a weaker acid than HBr and HI. Therefore, among the given options (HBr, H2O, H2S, HI), the order from strongest to weakest is HI > HBr > H2S > H2O. So the strongest is HI, which is option D.\n\nBut let me think again about the bond strength and electronegativity. For HBr vs H2S: Br is more electronegative than S, but the bond strength is weaker. The weaker bond makes HBr release H+ more easily. Also, the conjugate base Br- is more stable than S^2- because Br- is larger and can disperse the negative charge better. So both factors (weaker bond and more stable conjugate base) make HBr a stronger acid than H2S. Similarly, HI has even weaker bond and more stable I- than Br-, so HI is stronger than HBr. Therefore, the answer is D: HI.\n</think>"}
