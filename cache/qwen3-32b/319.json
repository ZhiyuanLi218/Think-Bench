Alright, let me start by recalling some algebra concepts here. \n\nFirst, since a, b, c are roots of the polynomial x³ - 2011x + m, by Vieta's formulas, I can relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of the roots. Let me write down Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation. For a general cubic equation x³ + px² + qx + r = 0 with roots a, b, c, the formulas are:\n\n1. a + b + c = -p\n2. ab + ac + bc = q\n3. abc = -r\n\nBut in our case, the polynomial is x³ - 2011x + m. Comparing this with the general form, we can note that the coefficient of x² is 0. So let me adjust Vieta's formulas accordingly. Let me rewrite the polynomial as x³ + 0x² - 2011x + m. Therefore, applying Vieta's formulas:\n\n1. a + b + c = -0 = 0\n2. ab + ac + bc = -2011\n3. abc = -m\n\nSo, the sum of the roots is zero, the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is -2011, and the product of the roots is -m. \n\nSince we are told that a, b, c are integers, we need to find integers a, b, c such that their sum is zero, their pairwise products sum to -2011, and then m is just the negative of their product. The question is asking for the sum of the absolute values of the roots, so |a| + |b| + |c|.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since a + b + c = 0, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let me solve for c: c = -a - b. Then substitute this into the second equation, ab + ac + bc = -2011. Let me compute that:\n\nab + a(-a - b) + b(-a - b) = ab - a² - ab - ab - b² = ?\n\nWait, let me do that step by step. Let me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: ab\n\nSecond term: ac = a*(-a - b) = -a² - ab\n\nThird term: bc = b*(-a - b) = -ab - b²\n\nTherefore, adding them up:\n\nab + (-a² - ab) + (-ab - b²) = ab - a² - ab - ab - b² = -a² - ab - b²\n\nTherefore, according to Vieta's formula, this equals -2011:\n\n-a² - ab - b² = -2011\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\na² + ab + b² = 2011\n\nSo now we have an equation in terms of a and b: a² + ab + b² = 2011. Our goal is to find integers a and b satisfying this equation, then c is determined as -a - b, and then compute |a| + |b| + |c|.\n\nSo, how do I solve a² + ab + b² = 2011 for integers a and b?\n\nThis seems like a Diophantine equation. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can assume some symmetry here. Since the equation is symmetric in a and b, perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that |a| ≥ |b| or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I can consider variables substitution.\n\nAlternatively, note that a² + ab + b² is equal to ((a + b)^2 + a² + b²)/2? Wait, let me check:\n\n(a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So a² + ab + b² = (a + b)^2 - ab. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of a² + ab + b² as something related to complex numbers? For example, if we think of a and b as integers, then a² + ab + b² is the norm of the Eisenstein integer a + bω, where ω is a primitive third root of unity. But maybe that's too abstract for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about this as quadratic in a. Let me fix b and think of a² + ab + (b² - 2011) = 0. Then solving for a:\n\na = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4*(1)*(b² - 2011))]/2\n\nSimplify discriminant:\n\nsqrt(b² - 4b² + 4*2011) = sqrt(-3b² + 8044)\n\nFor a to be integer, discriminant must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = -3b² + 8044. Therefore, D must be non-negative and a perfect square. So:\n\n-3b² + 8044 ≥ 0 => 3b² ≤ 8044 => b² ≤ 8044 / 3 ≈ 2681.333. Therefore, |b| ≤ sqrt(2681.333) ≈ 51.78. Therefore, |b| ≤ 51. So possible integer values for b are from -51 to 51. Similarly, since the equation is symmetric in a and b, maybe we can assume some order between a and b.\n\nBut trying all values from -51 to 51 is tedious, but maybe manageable with some optimizations. Alternatively, perhaps we can find bounds on a and b. Let me note that since a² + ab + b² = 2011, and since squares are non-negative, so each term contributes. Let me think about possible values.\n\nAlternatively, since a + b + c = 0, then c = -a - b. Therefore, the three roots are a, b, -a - b. So maybe we can think of them as x, y, -x - y. Then, the sum of products is xy + x*(-x - y) + y*(-x - y) = xy - x² - xy - xy - y² = -x² - xy - y² = -2011, so x² + xy + y² = 2011. So same equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that x² + xy + y² is always non-negative, which it is, since for real numbers, it's equal to (x + y/2)^2 + 3y²/4 ≥ 0.\n\nBut since we need it to equal 2011, a positive integer. So maybe we can think about possible integer solutions. Let me consider that x and y are integers. Let me try to find integers x, y such that x² + xy + y² = 2011.\n\nAlternatively, since x² + xy + y² is symmetric in x and y, we can assume that |x| ≥ |y| or something like that. Also, note that if (x, y) is a solution, then so are (-x, -y), (y, x), etc. So maybe we can assume that x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0? Not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, note that if x and y have the same sign, then x² + xy + y² is positive. If they have opposite signs, then xy is negative, but x² + y² is positive. Let me check whether it's possible for x and y to have opposite signs.\n\nSuppose x is positive and y is negative. Let me write y = -z, where z is positive. Then x² + x*(-z) + (-z)^2 = x² - xz + z². Which is still a positive quantity. For example, x² - xz + z² = (x - z/2)^2 + 3z²/4 ≥ 0. So regardless of signs, the expression is positive. Therefore, possible solutions can have any signs. \n\nBut perhaps to find solutions, we can assume some positivity. Let me assume that x and y are non-negative integers. Then, x² + xy + y² = 2011. Let me try to find such x and y. Let me note that x and y cannot be too large. For example, if x and y are both positive, then x² + xy + y² ≥ x² + y². Therefore, x² + y² ≤ 2011. Therefore, x and y are each less than sqrt(2011) ≈ 44.8. So x and y are between 0 and 44. But since we assumed they are non-negative integers. However, since x and y can be negative as well, but maybe starting with positive integers would help find solutions.\n\nAlternatively, since x² + xy + y² = 2011, and if x and y are both positive, then x and y can't be too big. Let me try to bound them. For example, suppose x ≥ y ≥ 0. Then x² ≤ x² + xy + y² = 2011, so x ≤ sqrt(2011) ≈ 44.8. So x ≤ 44. Similarly, if y is at least something. Let me try to iterate over possible x values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about modulo something. Let me consider the equation modulo small numbers to narrow down possibilities. For example, modulo 3. Let me compute x² + xy + y² mod 3.\n\nNote that squares mod 3 are 0 and 1. Let me check:\n\nIf x ≡ 0 mod 3, x² ≡ 0.\n\nIf x ≡ 1 mod 3, x² ≡ 1.\n\nIf x ≡ 2 mod 3, x² ≡ 4 ≡ 1.\n\nSimilarly for y.\n\nTherefore, x² + xy + y² mod 3 can be:\n\nCase 1: x ≡ 0 mod 3, y ≡ 0 mod 3: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 mod 3.\n\nCase 2: x ≡ 0 mod 3, y ≡ 1 mod 3: 0 + 0*1 + 1 = 1 mod 3.\n\nCase 3: x ≡ 0 mod 3, y ≡ 2 mod 3: same as case 2, 0 + 0*2 + 1 = 1 mod 3.\n\nCase 4: x ≡ 1 mod 3, y ≡ 1 mod 3: 1 + 1*1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\n\nCase 5: x ≡ 1 mod 3, y ≡ 2 mod 3: 1 + 1*2 + 4 ≡ 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3.\n\nCase 6: x ≡ 1 mod 3, y ≡ 0 mod 3: same as case 2.\n\nCase 7: x ≡ 2 mod 3, y ≡ 2 mod 3: 4 + 2*2 + 4 ≡ 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\n\nCase 8: x ≡ 2 mod 3, y ≡ 0 mod 3: same as case 3.\n\nCase 9: x ≡ 2 mod 3, y ≡ 1 mod 3: same as case 5.\n\nTherefore, x² + xy + y² ≡ 0 or 1 mod 3. Therefore, 2011 mod 3 is equal to... Let's calculate 2011 divided by 3. 3*670 = 2010, so 2011 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, our equation x² + xy + y² ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, possible cases are when the expression is 1 mod 3. Therefore, looking back, cases where the expression is 1 mod 3 are:\n\nCase 2, 3, 5. Which correspond to when one of x or y is 0 mod 3 and the other is non-zero mod 3, or both are 1 and 2 mod 3? Wait, case 5 is when one is 1 and the other is 2 mod 3. So overall, the equation x² + xy + y² ≡ 1 mod 3 implies that either:\n\n- One of x or y is 0 mod 3 and the other is non-zero mod 3, or\n\n- x ≡ 1 mod 3 and y ≡ 2 mod 3, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, this gives us some constraints. For example, if neither x nor y is divisible by 3, then they must be 1 and 2 mod 3. If one is divisible by 3, the other isn't. \n\nThis might help us later when trying to find solutions. Let me keep that in mind.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the equation x² + xy + y² = 2011 as an ellipse or something in the plane, but since we need integer solutions, perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize the solutions. For example, suppose that we set variables u = x + y and v = x - y or something. Let me try:\n\nLet me note that x² + xy + y² = (x + y)^2 - xy. Wait, we did that earlier. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that x² + xy + y² = (x^3 - y^3)/(x - y) when x ≠ y. But since we have integers, maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of this as quadratic in y: y² + xy + x² - 2011 = 0. Then discriminant for y is x² - 4*(x² - 2011) = x² - 4x² + 8044 = -3x² + 8044. Which is same as earlier, so for y to be integer, discriminant must be a square. Therefore, similar to previous approach.\n\nTherefore, for each integer x, such that -3x² + 8044 is non-negative and a perfect square, then y can be found. Which is same as earlier.\n\nSo, given that, perhaps I can iterate over possible x values (from -51 to 51) and check if -3x² + 8044 is a perfect square. However, doing this manually would be tedious, but perhaps I can find some bounds or patterns.\n\nAlternatively, note that -3x² + 8044 = k² for some integer k. Therefore, 3x² + k² = 8044. Therefore, looking for integer solutions (x, k) to 3x² + k² = 8044. \n\nThis equation might be easier to analyze. Let me consider this. Since 3x² + k² = 8044. Let me note that both x and k must satisfy 3x² ≤ 8044 => x² ≤ 8044/3 ≈ 2681.33 => |x| ≤ 51.78 => |x| ≤ 51. Similarly, k² ≤ 8044 => |k| ≤ 89.7 => |k| ≤ 89.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can iterate over possible x values from 0 to 51 (since negative x would give same x² as positive x) and compute 8044 - 3x² and check if it's a perfect square. Let me try that.\n\nLet me start with x = 0: 8044 - 0 = 8044. Is 8044 a square? Let me check sqrt(8044). Well, 90² = 8100, so 89² = 7921. 8044 - 7921 = 123. Not a square. So no.\n\nx = 1: 8044 - 3(1) = 8041. sqrt(8041) ≈ 89.67. 89² = 7921, 90²=8100. Not a square.\n\nx = 2: 8044 - 3(4) = 8044 - 12 = 8032. sqrt(8032) ≈ 89.62. Not a square.\n\nx = 3: 8044 - 27 = 8017. Still between 89² and 90². Not square.\n\nx = 4: 8044 - 48 = 7996. Still not square.\n\nx = 5: 8044 - 75 = 7969. Let me check sqrt(7969). 89² = 7921, 90² = 8100. 89.5² = (89 + 0.5)^2 = 89² + 2*89*0.5 + 0.25 = 7921 + 89 + 0.25 = 8010.25. 7969 is less than that. Let me check 89² + 48 = 7921 + 48 = 7969. So sqrt(7969) is not integer. Because 89² + 48 is not a square. So no.\n\nx = 6: 8044 - 3*(36) = 8044 - 108 = 7936. Is 7936 a square? Let me check. 89² = 7921, 90² = 8100. 89.5² ≈ 8010. So between 89 and 90. Wait, 7936 is 7936. Let me check 89² = 7921, 89 + 15 = 104? Wait, maybe I can compute 89. Let me check 89*89=7921. Then 89*89 + 15 = 7936? 7921 + 15 = 7936? No, 7921 + 15 = 7936? 7921 + 15 is 7936? Wait, 7921 + 15 is 7936? Let me check 7921 + 10 = 7931, +5=7936. Yes. So 7936 is 89² + 15. Not a perfect square. Therefore, no.\n\nx=7: 8044 - 3*(49) = 8044 - 147 = 7897. Not a square.\n\nx=8: 8044 - 3*64= 8044 - 192= 7852. Not square.\n\nx=9: 8044 - 3*81= 8044 - 243= 7801. Let me check sqrt(7801). 88²=7744, 89²=7921. 7801-7744=57. Not square.\n\nx=10: 8044 - 300= 7744. Wait, 7744 is 88². Oh! So here we go. For x=10, 3x² + k² = 8044 => k² = 8044 - 3*(10)^2 = 8044 - 300 = 7744 = 88². Therefore, k=±88. Therefore, this gives us solutions for y. Recall that earlier, when we considered the quadratic in y, we had discriminant D = k² = 88², so y = [-x ± k]/2. Wait, earlier when I considered solving for a in terms of b, I had discriminant sqrt(-3b² + 8044). But here, considering solving for y in terms of x, we have discriminant sqrt( -3x² + 8044 ) = sqrt(k²) = |k|. Therefore, y = [ -x ± k ] / 2. Therefore, for x=10, k=±88. Therefore, y = [ -10 ± 88 ] / 2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\ny = (-10 + 88)/2 = 78/2 = 39\n\ny = (-10 - 88)/2 = -98/2 = -49\n\nTherefore, for x=10, we have solutions y=39 and y=-49. Therefore, corresponding to these, we have pairs (x, y) = (10, 39) and (10, -49). \n\nTherefore, these are possible solutions. Let me check if they satisfy x² + xy + y² = 2011.\n\nFirst, check (10, 39):\n\n10² + 10*39 + 39² = 100 + 390 + 1521 = 100 + 390 = 490; 490 + 1521 = 2011. Yes! Perfect.\n\nCheck (10, -49):\n\n10² + 10*(-49) + (-49)^2 = 100 - 490 + 2401 = 100 - 490 = -390 + 2401 = 2011. Yes, same result. \n\nGreat, so we found solutions. Therefore, corresponding to x=10 and y=39, we can get one set of roots. Similarly, for x=10 and y=-49. But since the equation is symmetric, we can generate other solutions by permuting variables. \n\nTherefore, let me note that if (a, b) = (10, 39), then c = -a - b = -10 - 39 = -49. Similarly, if (a, b) = (10, -49), then c = -10 - (-49) = 39. Therefore, the three roots would be 10, 39, -49. Similarly, permuting them. Therefore, the absolute values would be |10| + |39| + |49| = 10 + 39 + 49 = 98. So that's a candidate answer. \n\nBut I need to check if there are other solutions. Because maybe there are other x values for which 3x² + k² = 8044. Let me continue checking x from 11 onwards.\n\nx=11: 3*(121) = 363; 8044 - 363 = 7681. Is 7681 a square? Let me check sqrt(7681). 87²=7569, 88²=7744. 7681 - 7569=112, not a square.\n\nx=12: 3*(144)=432; 8044 - 432=7612. Not a square. 87²=7569, 88²=7744. 7612-7569=43, not square.\n\nx=13: 3*(169)=507; 8044 - 507=7537. Still between 87² and 88². Not square.\n\nx=14: 3*(196)=588; 8044 - 588=7456. Let me check sqrt(7456). 86²=7396, 87²=7569. 7456 - 7396=60. Not square.\n\nx=15: 3*(225)=675; 8044 - 675=7369. Let me check sqrt(7369). 85²=7225, 86²=7396. 7369 - 7225=144. 144 is 12². Wait, but 85² + 144 = 7225 + 144 = 7369. However, 85² + 12² = 7369. But is 7369 a square? Let me check 85.8² or something? Wait, 86² is 7396. So 7369 is between 85² and 86², so not a perfect square. Therefore, no.\n\nx=16: 3*(256)=768; 8044 - 768=7276. 85²=7225, 86²=7396. 7276-7225=51. Not square.\n\nx=17: 3*(289)=867; 8044 - 867=7177. 84²=7056, 85²=7225. 7177-7056=121=11². But 7177 is not a square. Because 84² + 121 = 7056 + 121=7177. But sqrt(7177) is not integer. Since 84.7² is approx?\n\nx=18: 3*(324)=972; 8044 - 972=7072. 84²=7056, 85²=7225. 7072 - 7056=16. So sqrt(7072) is sqrt(84² + 16). Not a perfect square. Because if it were, then 7072 would be a square. But 84² + 16 = 7056 + 16 = 7072. Not a square. Because (84 + a)^2 = 84² + 168a + a². If we set that equal to 7072, then 168a + a² = 16. If a=1, 168 + 1=169≠16. a=0. No. So no.\n\nx=19: 3*(361)=1083; 8044 - 1083=6961. Let me check sqrt(6961). 83²=6889, 84²=7056. 6961 - 6889=72.

Not square.\n\nx=27: 3*(729)=2187; 8044 - 2187=5857. 76²=5776, 77²=5929. 5857 - 5776=81. 81 is square, but 5776 + 81 = 5857. However, 76² + 9² = 5857. Not a perfect square. Because 76.5² is?\n\nx=28: 3*(784)=2352; 8044 - 2352=5692. 75²=5625, 76²=5776. 5692 - 5625=67. Not square.\n\nx=29: 3*(841)=2523; 8044 - 2523=5521. sqrt(5521). 74²=5476, 75²=5625. 5521 - 5476=45. Not square.\n\nx=30: 3*(900)=2700; 8044 - 2700=5344. sqrt(5344). Let me check 73²=5329, 74²=5476. 5344 - 5329=15. Not square.\n\nx=31: 3*(961)=2883; 8044 - 2883=5161. sqrt(5161). 71²=5041, 72²=5184. 5161 - 5041=120. Not square.\n\nx=32: 3*(1024)=3072; 8044 - 3072=4972. 70²=4900, 71²=5041. 4972 - 4900=72. Not square.\n\nx=33: 3*(1089)=3267; 8044 - 3267=4777. 69²=4761, 70²=4900. 4777 - 4761=16. So sqrt(4777) is sqrt(69² + 4²). Not a square. Because 69² + 4² = 4777. Not a square.\n\nx=34: 3*(1156)=3468; 8044 - 3468=4576. sqrt(4576). 67²=4489, 68²=4624. 4576 - 4489=87. Not square.\n\nx=35: 3*(1225)=3675; 8044 - 3675=4369. sqrt(4369). Let me check 66²=4356, 67²=4489. 4369 - 4356=13. Not square.\n\nx=36: 3*(1296)=3888; 8044 - 3888=4156. 64²=4096, 65²=4225. 4156 - 4096=60. Not square.\n\nx=37: 3*(1369)=4107; 8044 - 4107=3937. 62²=3844, 63²=3969. 3937 - 3844=93. Not square.\n\nx=38: 3*(1444)=4332; 8044 - 4332=3712. 60²=3600, 61²=3721. 3712 - 3600=112. Not square.\n\nx=39: 3*(1521)=4563; 8044 - 4563=3481. sqrt(3481). Let me check 59²=3481. Yes! 59*59=3481. Therefore, for x=39, k=±59. Therefore, y = [ -x ± k ] / 2 = [ -39 ± 59 ] / 2. So two possibilities:\n\ny = (-39 + 59)/2 = 20/2 = 10\n\ny = (-39 - 59)/2 = -98/2 = -49\n\nTherefore, pairs (x, y) = (39, 10) and (39, -49). Which are same as previous solutions, just swapping x and y. Therefore, same roots: 10, 39, -49.\n\nTherefore, moving on.\n\nx=40: 3*(1600)=4800; 8044 - 4800=3244. sqrt(3244). 57²=3249. Close. 56²=3136. 3244 - 3136=108. Not square.\n\nx=41: 3*(1681)=5043; 8044 - 5043=29, 8044 - 5043= 8044-5000=3044-43=29, 8044 - 5043= 3001? Wait, 8044 - 5043: 8044 - 5000 = 3044; 3044 - 43 = 3001. Let me check sqrt(3001). 54²=2916, 55²=3025. 3001 - 2916=85. Not square.\n\nx=42: 3*(1764)=5292; 8044 - 5292=2752. sqrt(2752). 52²=2704, 53²=2809. 2752 - 2704=48.

Not square.\n\nx=45: 3*(2025)=6075; 8044 - 6075=1969. 44²=1936, 45²=2025. 1969 - 1936=33. Not square.\n\nx=46: 3*(2116)=6348; 8044 - 6348=1696. sqrt(1696). 41²=1681, 42²=1764. 1696 - 1681=15. Not square.\n\nx=47: 3*(2209)=6627; 8044 - 6627=1417. 37²=1369, 38²=1444. Not square.\n\nx=48: 3*(2304)=6912; 8044 - 6912=1132. 33²=1089, 34²=1156. Not square.\n\nx=49: 3*(2401)=7203; 8044 - 7203=841. sqrt(841)=29. Oh! So here we go. For x=49, k=±29. Therefore, y = [ -49 ± 29 ] / 2. Therefore:\n\ny = (-49 + 29)/2 = (-20)/2 = -10\n\ny = (-49 - 29)/2 = (-78)/2 = -39\n\nTherefore, pairs (x, y) = (49, -10) and (49, -39). Therefore, check if they satisfy x² + xy + y² = 2011.\n\nFirst, (49, -10):\n\n49² + 49*(-10) + (-10)^2 = 2401 - 490 + 100 = 2401 - 490 = 1911 + 100 = 2011. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, (49, -39):\n\n49² + 49*(-39) + (-39)^2 = 2401 - 1911 + 1521 = 2401 - 1911 = 490 + 1521 = 2011. Yes. \n\nTherefore, these are valid solutions. Therefore, corresponding roots would be a=49, b=-10, c = -a - b = -49 - (-10) = -39. Or a=49, b=-39, c = -49 - (-39) = -10. So again, same set of roots: 49, -10, -39. Absolute values same as before: 49 + 10 + 39 = 98. Same as before.\n\nContinuing:\n\nx=50: 3*(2500)=7500; 8044 - 7500=544. sqrt(544). 23²=529, 24²=576. Not square.\n\nx=51: 3*(2601)=7803; 8044 - 7803=241. sqrt(241) ≈ 15.52. Not square.\n\nSo for x from 0 to 51, we found solutions at x=10, 39, 49. But note that x=10 and x=39 are related (since 10 + 39 = 49?), but in any case, they produce same roots. Similarly, x=49 gives another set but same roots.\n\nTherefore, so far, we have found that the only integer solutions for (a, b) are permutations and sign changes leading to roots 10, 39, -49. \n\nBut we need to check negative x values as well? Wait, since we considered x from 0 to 51, but if we take x negative, then x² is same as positive x, so we would get same results. For example, x=-10 would give same calculation as x=10. Therefore, the solutions would be symmetric. Therefore, we can assume that we have found all solutions.\n\nBut just to confirm, let me check for example x=-10. Then 3x² is same as for x=10, so same k². Therefore, y would be [ -x ± k ] / 2 = [10 ± 88]/2, which is same as before. Therefore, same roots.\n\nTherefore, the only integer solutions for the equation a² + ab + b² = 2011 are permutations of (10, 39, -49). Therefore, the roots are 10, 39, -49. Therefore, their absolute values add up to 10 + 39 + 49 = 98. \n\nBut wait, before finalizing, let me check if there are other solutions. For example, maybe there are solutions where one of the variables is zero? Let me check. Suppose a=0. Then the equation becomes 0 + 0 + b² = 2011. Therefore, b²=2011. But 2011 is not a perfect square (since 44²=1936 and 45²=2025). Therefore, no solution here.\n\nSimilarly, if two variables are zero, then 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ≠ 2011. So no. \n\nWhat if one of the variables is equal to the other? For example, suppose a = b. Then equation becomes a² + a² + a² = 3a² = 2011 => a² = 2011 / 3 ≈ 670.333. Not integer. Therefore, no solution here.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that one of the variables is equal to -the other. Let me suppose that b = -a. Then equation becomes a² + a*(-a) + (-a)^2 = a² - a² + a² = a² = 2011. Again, same as before, which is not square. Therefore, no solution here.\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions with a = b or a = -b or a = 0. Therefore, our previous solutions are the only ones.\n\nTherefore, the roots are 10, 39, -49 in some order, and the sum of absolute values is 10 + 39 + 49 = 98.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are other solutions where maybe x and y are both negative. For example, suppose x=-10, y=-39. Then c = -x - y = 10 + 39 = 49. Then same set of roots. Absolute values same. So nothing new.\n\nAlternatively, maybe other combinations? Let me think. Suppose we have another set of numbers. For example, maybe smaller numbers?\n\nBut according to our search above, we found only one set of solutions. Let me check if there are other possibilities. For example, maybe if x and y are both negative? But as we saw, it would result in same absolute values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution where x and y are different? Let me check for example, if there is another x between 0 and 51 where 3x² + k² = 8044. We found x=10, 39, 49. Let me check x= something else?\n\nWait, when x=39, we had k=59, which gave y=10 and y=-49. Similarly, x=49 gave k=29, which gave y=-10 and y=-39. So, same solutions. Therefore, seems like only these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution where x and y are not integers but... Wait, no, we are looking for integer solutions. Therefore, seems like the only solutions are permutations of (10, 39, -49). Therefore, answer is 98.\n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check if there are other possible x's where 3x² + k² = 8044. For example, maybe x= something else. Wait, for example, when x=  something where k is multiple of something. But since we checked all x from 0 to 51, and found only three x's (10, 39, 49) leading to solutions, and they all correspond to same roots, I think we can be confident.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 98. Therefore, |a| + |b| + |c| = 10 + 39 + 49 = 98.\n\nBut just to check Vieta's formula for abc and m. Let me compute abc. For roots 10, 39, -49: product is 10*39*(-49) = 10*(-49)*39 = -490*39. Let me compute that: 490*40 = 19600, minus 490 = 19600 - 490 = 19110. Therefore, abc = -19110. Therefore, m = -abc = 19110. But the problem didn't ask for m, just the sum of absolute values, so that's fine.\n\nAlso, check the sum of the products: ab + ac + bc. Let me compute for roots 10, 39, -49:\n\nab = 10*39 = 390\n\nac = 10*(-49) = -490\n\nbc = 39*(-49) = -1911\n\nSum: 390 - 490 - 1911 = (390 - 490) - 1911 = (-100) - 1911 = -2011. Which matches Vieta's formula. Perfect. \n\nTherefore, everything checks out. Therefore, the answer is 98.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{98}\n</think>"}
