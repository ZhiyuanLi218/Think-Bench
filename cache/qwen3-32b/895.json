First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.\n\nWe have Jon and Steve riding their bicycles along a path that's parallel to two side-by-side train tracks running east-west. Jon is going east at 20 mph, and Steve is going west at 20 mph. There are two trains, each of equal length, traveling in opposite directions (so one is eastbound and one is westbound) at constant but different speeds. Each train takes exactly 1 minute to pass Jon. The westbound train takes 10 times as long as the eastbound train to pass Steve. We need to find the length of each train in miles, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, so first, let me note down the key information:\n\n- Jon's speed: 20 mph east\n- Steve's speed: 20 mph west\n- Two trains: same length, opposite directions, different speeds\n- Time for each train to pass Jon: 1 minute\n- Time for westbound train to pass Steve: 10 times the time for eastbound train to pass Steve\n- Find length of each train.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when a train passes a moving observer, the relative speed between the train and the observer determines how long it takes for the entire train to pass. Since both Jon and Steve are moving, we need to consider their relative speeds with respect to the trains.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet L be the length of each train (in miles). Since both trains are of equal length, both eastbound and westbound trains have length L.\n\nLet v_e be the speed of the eastbound train (in mph).\n\nLet v_w be the speed of the westbound train (in mph).\n\nNow, when the trains pass Jon, who is moving east at 20 mph, we need to calculate the relative speed between the train and Jon.\n\nFor the eastbound train passing Jon:\n\nSince both are moving east, their relative speed is (v_e - Jon's speed). However, since the train is passing Jon, if the train is going faster than Jon, the relative speed is v_e - 20. If it's slower, the relative speed would be 20 - v_e, but since the train takes 1 minute to pass him, I assume the train is moving faster than Jon. Similarly for the westbound train passing Jon, since Jon is moving east and the train is moving west, their relative speed is v_w + 20.\n\nSimilarly, when the trains pass Steve, who is moving west at 20 mph. For the eastbound train passing Steve: their relative speed is v_e + 20. For the westbound train passing Steve: their relative speed is v_w - 20. Again, assuming the westbound train is moving faster than Steve (since it takes some positive time to pass him). But we need to be careful here.\n\nGiven that each train takes exactly 1 minute to pass Jon. Let me write equations for that.\n\nFirst, for the eastbound train passing Jon:\n\nThe time it takes for the entire train to pass Jon is equal to the length of the train divided by the relative speed between the train and Jon.\n\nSo, time = L / (relative speed). Since time is given as 1 minute, which is 1/60 hours. Therefore:\n\nFor the eastbound train passing Jon:\n\nL / (v_e - 20) = 1/60.\n\nSimilarly, for the westbound train passing Jon:\n\nL / (v_w + 20) = 1/60.\n\nTherefore, we have two equations:\n\n1) L = (v_e - 20) * (1/60)\n\n2) L = (v_w + 20) * (1/60)\n\nTherefore, since both equal L, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n(v_e - 20) * (1/60) = (v_w + 20) * (1/60)\n\nMultiply both sides by 60:\n\nv_e - 20 = v_w + 20\n\nTherefore:\n\nv_e - v_w = 40.\n\nSo that's one relationship between v_e and v_w.\n\nNow, moving on to the information about Steve.\n\nThe westbound train takes 10 times as long as the eastbound train to go past Steve.\n\nFirst, let me figure out the time it takes for each train to pass Steve.\n\nFor the eastbound train passing Steve:\n\nSteve is moving west at 20 mph, and the train is moving east at v_e mph. Therefore, their relative speed is v_e + 20 mph. Therefore, the time to pass Steve is L / (v_e + 20). Let me denote this time as t_e.\n\nFor the westbound train passing Steve:\n\nSteve is moving west at 20 mph, and the train is moving west at v_w mph. Wait, no: westbound train is moving west, and Steve is also moving west. Therefore, their relative speed is v_w - 20 (assuming the train is faster than Steve; if not, the relative speed would be negative, but since time is positive, we need to make sure that the train is moving faster than Steve in order for it to pass him. Since the problem says \"each pass the two riders,\" so both trains must be passing both riders, so their speeds must be such that they are passing them. So for the westbound train passing Steve (who is also going west), the relative speed is v_w - 20. Since the train is westbound, if v_w > 20, then the relative speed is positive, and the train is catching up to Steve. If v_w < 20, the relative speed is negative, meaning Steve is moving faster west than the train, but since the train is supposed to pass Steve, we must have v_w > 20. Similarly, for the eastbound train passing Steve, since Steve is moving west, their relative speed is v_e + 20, which is definitely positive as long as v_e is positive. So, we can proceed.\n\nLet me denote t_e as the time for the eastbound train to pass Steve, and t_w as the time for the westbound train to pass Steve. According to the problem, t_w = 10 * t_e.\n\nSo, t_e = L / (v_e + 20)\n\nt_w = L / (v_w - 20)\n\nGiven that t_w = 10 * t_e:\n\nL / (v_w - 20) = 10 * [L / (v_e + 20)]\n\nWe can cancel L from both sides (assuming L ≠ 0, which it isn't):\n\n1 / (v_w - 20) = 10 / (v_e + 20)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nv_e + 20 = 10*(v_w - 20)\n\nSo:\n\nv_e + 20 = 10*v_w - 200\n\nRearranged:\n\nv_e = 10*v_w - 200 - 20 = 10*v_w - 220\n\nTherefore, we have another equation:\n\nv_e = 10*v_w - 220\n\nEarlier, we had from the first part:\n\nv_e - v_w = 40 => v_e = v_w + 40\n\nTherefore, substituting into the above equation:\n\nv_w + 40 = 10*v_w - 220\n\nLet me solve for v_w:\n\nv_w + 40 = 10*v_w - 220\n\nBring variables to left and constants to right:\n\nv_w - 10*v_w = -220 - 40 => -9*v_w = -260 => v_w = (-260)/(-9) = 260/9 mph\n\nThen, since v_e = v_w + 40, substitute:\n\nv_e = 260/9 + 40 = 260/9 + 360/9 = 620/9 mph\n\nSo now, we can compute L from one of the earlier equations. Let me recall:\n\nFrom equation 1: L = (v_e - 20)/60\n\nCompute v_e - 20:\n\nv_e - 20 = 620/9 - 20 = 620/9 - 180/9 = 440/9\n\nTherefore, L = (440/9)/60 = 440/(9*60) = 440/540 = Simplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 20: 440 ÷ 20 = 22; 540 ÷ 20 = 27. So 22/27.\n\nWait, 22 and 27 have no common factors besides 1, so m = 22, n = 27, so m + n = 49. But let me check if my calculations are correct because 22/27 seems straightforward, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nFirst, solving for v_w:\n\nFrom -9v_w = -260 => v_w = 260/9 ≈ 28.888... mph\n\nThen, v_e = v_w + 40 = 260/9 + 40 = 260/9 + 360/9 = 620/9 ≈ 68.888... mph\n\nThen, L = (v_e - 20)/60.\n\nv_e - 20 is 620/9 - 20. Let me convert 20 to ninths: 20 = 180/9. Therefore, 620/9 - 180/9 = 440/9. Then divide by 60:\n\nL = (440/9)/60 = 440/(9*60) = 440/540. Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 20: 440 ÷ 20 = 22, 540 ÷ 20 = 27. So yes, 22/27. Therefore, L = 22/27 miles. Then m + n is 22 + 27 = 49. Hmm. But let me check with the other equation for L.\n\nAlternatively, from the westbound train passing Jon:\n\nL = (v_w + 20)/60. Let me compute that.\n\nv_w + 20 = 260/9 + 20 = 260/9 + 180/9 = 440/9. Then divide by 60: same as above, 440/(9*60) = 22/27. So same result. Therefore, seems consistent.\n\nBut let me check with the other condition regarding Steve. Let me compute t_e and t_w and check if t_w is 10 times t_e.\n\nFirst, t_e = L / (v_e + 20). Let's compute v_e + 20: 620/9 + 20 = 620/9 + 180/9 = 800/9. Then t_e = (22/27) / (800/9) = (22/27) * (9/800) = (22/3)/800 = 22/(3*800) = 22/2400 = 11/1200 hours.\n\nSimilarly, t_w = L / (v_w - 20). Compute v_w - 20: 260/9 - 20 = 260/9 - 180/9 = 80/9. Then t_w = (22/27) / (80/9) = (22/27)*(9/80) = (22/3)/80 = 22/(240) = 11/120 hours.\n\nNow, check if t_w is 10*t_e:\n\n10*t_e = 10*(11/1200) = 11/120, which is exactly t_w. So yes, 11/120 = 11/120. Therefore, that checks out. Therefore, the length is indeed 22/27 miles, so m + n is 22 + 27 = 49. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check once more because sometimes with relative speed problems, there might be a direction consideration. For example, when the train is passing the person, is the relative speed correctly calculated?\n\nFor example, when the eastbound train passes Jon (who is moving east), the relative speed is indeed (v_e - Jon's speed). Since the train is overtaking Jon, so yes, the relative speed is the difference. Similarly, for the westbound train passing Jon (going east), their relative speed is the sum. For Steve, moving west, eastbound train approaching from the opposite direction, so relative speed is sum. Westbound train going same direction as Steve, so relative speed is difference. All seems correct.\n\nAnother sanity check: the speeds. The westbound train is 260/9 ≈ 28.89 mph, which is faster than Steve's 20 mph, so it can pass him. The eastbound train is 620/9 ≈ 68.89 mph, which is faster than Jon's 20 mph, so it can pass him. The times to pass Jon are 1 minute, which seems reasonable.\n\nLet me check with actual numbers. Let's take L = 22/27 miles. Let me convert that to feet for better intuition? Well, maybe not necessary, but just to check.\n\nBut perhaps another way: Let me check the time for the eastbound train to pass Jon. The relative speed is v_e - 20 = 620/9 - 20 = 440/9 mph. The time is L / (relative speed) = (22/27) / (440/9) = (22/27)*(9/440) = (22*9)/(27*440) = (22/440)*(9/27) = (1/20)*(1/3) = 1/60 hours, which is 1 minute. Correct. Similarly for westbound train passing Jon: relative speed is v_w + 20 = 260/9 + 20 = 440/9, same as above, so same result. Correct.\n\nFor Steve, t_e = L / (v_e + 20) = (22/27)/( (620/9 + 20) ) = (22/27)/( (620 + 180)/9 ) = (22/27)/(800/9) = same as before, 11/1200 hours. 11/1200 hours is (11/1200)*60 minutes = 11/20 minutes = 0.55 minutes, which is 33 seconds. Then t_w is 10 times that, 5.5 minutes, which is 330 seconds. Let me check with actual numbers:\n\nt_w = L / (v_w - 20) = (22/27) / ( (260/9 - 20) ) = (22/27)/( (260 - 180)/9 ) = (22/27)/(80/9) = same as before, 11/120 hours. 11/120 hours is (11/120)*60 = 5.5 minutes, which is 10 times 0.55 minutes. Correct. So all the numbers check out.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 22 + 27 = 49. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n\nBut let me check again if I didn't make a mistake in the equations. Let me recap:\n\nFrom Jon's perspective:\n\nEastbound train: relative speed = v_e - 20. Time to pass: L / (v_e - 20) = 1/60. So L = (v_e - 20)/60.\n\nWestbound train: relative speed = v_w + 20. Time to pass: L / (v_w + 20) = 1/60. So L = (v_w + 20)/60. Therefore, equate them: v_e - 20 = v_w + 20 => v_e = v_w + 40. Correct.\n\nFrom Steve's perspective:\n\nEastbound train: relative speed = v_e + 20. Time to pass: L / (v_e + 20) = t_e.\n\nWestbound train: relative speed = v_w - 20. Time to pass: L / (v_w - 20) = t_w = 10 t_e.\n\nTherefore, L / (v_w - 20) = 10 L / (v_e + 20) => 1/(v_w - 20) = 10/(v_e + 20) => v_e + 20 = 10(v_w - 20). Then since v_e = v_w + 40, substitute:\n\nv_w + 40 + 20 = 10(v_w - 20) => v_w + 60 = 10v_w - 200 => 60 + 200 = 10v_w - v_w => 260 = 9v_w => v_w = 260/9. Correct. So all steps are correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n</think>"}
