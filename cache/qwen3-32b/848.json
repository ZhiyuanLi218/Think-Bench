So, we have an aperture that's shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shone on it along the z-axis, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. The options are given, and we can use the small angle approximation tanθ ≈ θ.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an apothem is. An apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. It's like the radius of the inscribed circle. So, for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem 'a' relates to the side length and the radius of the circumscribed circle. But as N becomes very large, the polygon approaches a circle. So maybe in the limit as N approaches infinity, this polygon becomes a circular aperture with radius equal to the apothem 'a'? Wait, but for a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius. So maybe we can model this as a circular aperture problem?\n\nBut let me think again. If the polygon is regular, with all apothems equal to 'a', then when N is large, the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem. Because for a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the circumradius (distance from center to a vertex). For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is a = R * cos(π/N), where R is the circumradius. So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so the apothem approaches R. Therefore, in the limit N→infty, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. Therefore, the diffraction pattern should be similar to that of a circular aperture.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"all the apothems are of the same length a\". Since an apothem is the distance from the center to the side, for a regular polygon, all apothems are equal. So as N increases, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem. Therefore, the diffraction pattern would be the same as a circular aperture of radius a. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is called the Airy pattern, with the first minimum at an angle θ given by 1.22 λ / (2a), but wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nThe formula for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by sinθ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. But here, if the aperture is a circle with radius a, then the diameter is 2a. So substituting D = 2a, we get sinθ = 1.22 λ / (2a). However, since the angles are small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a. Therefore, the first minimum is at 0.61 λ/a. Then, the next minimum would be at a larger angle. But the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but for a circular aperture, the intensity minima occur at specific values of the first-order Bessel function. Let me recall the exact positions.\n\nThe intensity pattern for a circular aperture is given by the square of the Bessel function. The intensity is I(θ) = I0 [2J1(k a sinθ)/(k a sinθ)]², where J1 is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, and k is 2π/λ. The zeros of J1 determine the positions of the minima. The first zero of J1 occurs at the first root, let's call it x1, then the angle θ1 satisfies k a sinθ1 = x1. Similarly, the second zero is at x2, so θ2 corresponds to k a sinθ2 = x2. The angular distance between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1 ≈ (x2 - x1)(λ/(2π a)) assuming small angles.\n\nBut I need to remember the numerical values of the first two roots of J1. Let me recall. The first root of J1(x) is approximately 3.8317, and the second root is approximately 7.0156. Therefore, the first minimum occurs at x1 = 3.8317, which gives θ1 ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a). Similarly, θ2 ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ/a). Therefore, the angular distance between them is Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317)/(2π) * λ/a ≈ (3.1839)/(6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 0.507 * λ/a. Wait, so approximately 0.507 λ/a. Looking at the options, option A is 0.506 λ/a and D is 0.500. So maybe A is the answer? But wait, let me check my reasoning again.\n\nBut hold on, if the aperture is a circle with radius a, then the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a, which matches with option B. Wait, but according to the Bessel function approach, the first minimum occurs when k a sinθ = 3.8317. Let me compute that. k is 2π/λ, so:\n\nk a sinθ = 3.8317 ⇒ (2π/λ) * a * sinθ = 3.8317 ⇒ sinθ ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.61 * (λ/a). So yes, that gives θ ≈ 0.61 λ/a. Therefore, the first minimum is at θ ≈ 0.61 λ/a (option B). Then the second minimum is at θ ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 7.0156 / 6.2832 ≈ 1.116 λ/a. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is 1.116 - 0.61 ≈ 0.506 λ/a. Which is option A. Therefore, the answer should be A: 0.506 λ/a.\n\nBut let me make sure that the problem is indeed referring to a circular aperture. The problem says \"N-sided polygon, all apothems same length a\". As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. However, the radius of that circle is equal to the apothem of the polygon. For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the side length, but as N approaches infinity, the apothem becomes equal to the radius of the circle. Therefore, yes, the aperture becomes a circle of radius a. Therefore, the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture with radius a. Therefore, the angular distance between first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is option A.\n\nBut let me cross-verify. Let me recall that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter. Since here, the diameter would be 2a, so θ1 = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. Then, the second minimum is at 2.233 λ/D? Wait, no, let me check the exact positions.\n\nThe formula for the minima in the circular aperture diffraction pattern is given by:\n\nsinθ = (x_m λ)/(π D),\n\nwhere x_m are the roots of J1(x). Wait, let me check the exact formula. The intensity is given by:\n\nI(θ) = I0 [ (2 J1(k a sinθ)) / (k a sinθ) ]²,\n\nwhere k = 2π/λ. So setting the argument of J1 to x = k a sinθ.\n\nSo, J1(x) = 0. The roots of J1(x) are approximately 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So for each root x_m, we have:\n\nx_m = k a sinθ ⇒ sinθ = x_m / (k a) = x_m λ / (2π a).\n\nSince θ is small, sinθ ≈ θ ≈ x_m λ / (2π a).\n\nTherefore, the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) (λ/a) ≈ 0.61 (λ/a).\n\nSecond minimum is at θ2 ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) (λ/a) ≈ 1.116 (λ/a).\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between first two minima is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (1.116 - 0.61) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a, which matches option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check why option C is 1.22 λ/a. That is the angular position of the first minimum for a circular aperture. If someone mistakenly takes the first minimum as 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a (which is correct) but if someone confuses with a different aperture, like a slit. For example, for a single slit of width a, the first minimum is at θ = λ/a. But here, the answer for the first minimum is 0.61 λ/a, which is different. However, the question is about the distance between first two minima. So if someone thought that the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a (mistakenly taking diameter as a instead of 2a?), but no. Anyway, according to our calculation, the answer is A.\n\nBut let me think again if there's another approach. Since the problem says \"N-sided polygon with all apothems of length a\". When N approaches infinity, it's a circle with radius equal to the apothem a. Therefore, the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture with radius a. Therefore, the above calculation holds. Therefore, answer A.\n\nAlternatively, if someone models it as a regular polygon with N sides, and take N approaching infinity, perhaps there's another way to derive it? For example, maybe considering it as a multi-slit interference? But no, because a polygon is more like a shape with a continuous aperture, not multiple slits. So for N approaching infinity, it's a circular aperture. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: 0.506 λ/a.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
