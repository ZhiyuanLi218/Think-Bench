So, we have a Cherenkov radiation detector that produces 20 photons per incoming particle. The photomultiplier tube (PMT) has a conversion efficiency of 10%. We need to find out the approximate number of missed counts when there are 1000 incoming particles. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what conversion efficiency means. I think it refers to the probability that an incoming photon will actually cause the photocathode to emit an electron, right? So if the efficiency is 10%, that means each photon has a 10% chance of producing a photoelectron. And since one photoelectron is enough to generate a signal, we need at least one successful conversion per particle to count it. If none of the photons from a particular particle get converted, then that count is missed.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for each particle, there's a certain probability that none of the 20 photons are converted, leading to a missed count. Then, over 1000 particles, how many are missed?\n\nLet me formalize this. For a single incoming particle, the number of photons is 20. Each photon has a probability p = 0.1 of being converted, and 1 - p = 0.9 of not being converted. The probability that none of the 20 photons are converted is (0.9)^20. Therefore, the probability of missing a count for one particle is (0.9)^20. Then, the expected number of missed counts in 1000 particles would be 1000 * (0.9)^20.\n\nLet me compute (0.9)^20. Hmm. I don't remember the exact value, but maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, I can use logarithms or remember some powers of 0.9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Poisson approximation? Wait, but maybe it's straightforward to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, since each photon is an independent trial with small probability, but maybe not so small. Let's see. The expected number of photoelectrons per particle is 20 * 0.1 = 2. So on average, 2 photoelectrons per particle. But we need the probability that there are zero photoelectrons.\n\nIf we model this as a Poisson distribution with λ = 2, then the probability of zero events is e^{-λ} ≈ e^{-2} ≈ 0.1353. So approximately 13.5% chance of missing a count. Therefore, for 1000 particles, the missed counts would be roughly 1000 * 0.1353 ≈ 135.3. So approximately 135. Looking at the options, option C is 130. That seems close. But wait, is the Poisson approximation valid here?\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the exact value. The exact probability is (0.9)^20. Let me compute that. Let's take natural logarithm:\n\nln(0.9^20) = 20 * ln(0.9). Let me calculate ln(0.9). I know that ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x²/2 - x³/3 - ... for small x. Here x = 0.1, so ln(0.9) ≈ -0.1 - 0.005 - 0.00333... ≈ -0.1083... But let me check with actual value. Let me recall that ln(0.9) ≈ -0.1053605. So multiplying by 20 gives approximately -2.1072. Then exponentiating:\n\ne^{-2.1072} ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^{-2} ≈ 0.1353, e^{-2.1072} = e^{-2 - 0.1072} = e^{-2} * e^{-0.1072}. Now e^{-0.1072} ≈ 1 - 0.1072 + ... ≈ 0.898. So multiplying 0.1353 * 0.898 ≈ 0.1215. Therefore, (0.9)^20 ≈ 0.1215. Therefore, the exact probability is approximately 12.15%, so 1000 * 0.1215 ≈ 121.5 missed counts. So approximately 122. The closest option is C, which is 130. But 121.5 is closer to 130? Well, 121.5 is about 120, which is not exactly 130. Hmm. But maybe my approximations are off?\n\nAlternatively, let me try to calculate (0.9)^20 more accurately. Maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nLet me compute 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n0.9^4 = (0.81)^2 = 0.6561\n\n0.9^5 = 0.6561 * 0.9 = 0.59049\n\n0.9^10 = (0.59049)^2 ≈ 0.59049*0.59049. Let me compute that:\n\n0.5 * 0.59049 = 0.295245\n\n0.09 * 0.59049 = 0.0531441\n\n0.0049 * 0.59049 ≈ approx 0.002893. Wait, maybe better to do straight multiplication:\n\n0.59049 * 0.59049:\n\nFirst compute 59049 * 59049, but that's too big. Alternatively, approximate:\n\nWe know that 0.59049^2 ≈ (0.59)^2 = 0.3481, but more accurately:\n\nLet me write 0.59049 * 0.59049:\n\n= (0.5 + 0.09 + 0.00049) * same. But maybe use binomial expansion?\n\nAlternatively, remember that (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 where a = 0.59, b = 0.00049. But maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use calculator-like approach. Let me note that 0.59049 * 0.59049 ≈ 0.3486784401. Wait, actually, I remember that (0.9^5) is 0.59049, and (0.9^10) is known as approximately 0.3486784401. Yes, because e.g., 0.9^10 ≈ 0.3487. So that's a known value.\n\nTherefore, 0.9^10 ≈ 0.3487. Then 0.9^20 is (0.9^10)^2 ≈ (0.3487)^2. Let me compute that:\n\n0.3^2 = 0.09, 0.0487^2 ≈ 0.00237, and cross terms 2*0.3*0.0487 = 0.02922. So total approx 0.09 + 0.02922 + 0.00237 ≈ 0.1216. Therefore, (0.3487)^2 ≈ 0.1216. Therefore, (0.9)^20 ≈ 0.1216. Therefore, the exact probability is approx 12.16%, leading to 1000 * 0.1216 ≈ 121.6 missed counts. So approximately 122.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is C) 130, but 122 is closer to 130 than to 300 or 0. However, 122 is 12.2, which is between 130? Wait, the options are 0, 3, 130, 300. So 122 is closest to 130. But maybe my calculation is wrong? Alternatively, maybe the question expects using Poisson approximation, which gave us approx 135, which would round to 130 as option C. Therefore, maybe the answer is C) 130.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to think about this problem. For example, maybe the question assumes that each photon has 10% efficiency, so for each particle, the number of photoelectrons is 20*0.1=2. Then, if you need at least one photoelectron, then the probability of getting zero is e^{-2} ≈ 0.135, so 135, which is approx 130. So that would be option C. Therefore, maybe the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to compute 1 - (1 - 0.1)^20, but that would be the probability of detecting the particle. Wait, no. Wait, the probability of not detecting is (1 - 0.1)^20 = 0.9^20 ≈ 0.1215, so 12.15% missed, which is approx 121.5 counts. But the options are given as 0, 3, 130, 300. So 121.5 is closest to 130. Therefore, answer C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each photon is independent? Let me think again. The PMT's photocathode has 10% efficiency per photon. So for each of the 20 photons, there is an independent 10% chance of producing a photoelectron. The PMT will register a signal if at least one photoelectron is produced. Therefore, the probability of no signal is indeed (1 - 0.1)^20 ≈ 0.1215. Multiply by 1000 gives approx 121.5. So approx 122. Since the options don't have 122, but have 130, which is the closest, then answer C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach here. For example, maybe the question is thinking in terms of expectation? Wait, but expectation of number of photoelectrons is 2 per particle, but the expectation of number of detected particles is 1000*(1 - 0.9^20), and missed counts is 1000*0.9^20 ≈ 121.5. So answer is approx 122. But since options are given, and 130 is the closest, answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check 0.9^20 again. Let me use logarithms. Let me use base 10 logs. log10(0.9) ≈ -0.045757. Multiply by 20: -0.045757 * 20 ≈ -0.9151. Then 10^(-0.9151) = 10^(-0.9151). Since 10^(-0.9151) = 10^(-1 + 0.0849) = 10^0.0849 / 10 ≈ ?\n\n10^0.0849 ≈ since 10^0.08 ≈ approx 1.199 (because 10^0.1 ≈ 1.258, so 0.08 is less). Let me recall that ln(10^x) = x ln10. Alternatively, use approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, remember that log10(0.1215) ≈ ?\n\nWell, log10(0.1) = -1, log10(0.1215) ≈ -0.914. Which matches the previous value of -0.9151. So 10^(-0.9151) ≈ 0.1215. So yes, 0.1215. Therefore, 1000*0.1215 ≈ 121.5. So 121.5 is the exact value. Therefore, answer should be approx 122. But since the options don't have that, the closest is 130. Therefore, answer C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question? Let me check again.\n\n\"A Cherenkov radiation detector produces 20 photons for each incoming particle, and the conversion efficiency of the photomultiplier tube's photocathode is 10%. Assuming that one photoelectron in the tube can generate a signal, what is the approximate number of missed counts when there are 1000 incoming particles?\"\n\nYes, so for each particle, 20 photons. Each photon has 10% chance to create a photoelectron. If at least one photoelectron is created, the signal is detected. Therefore, the probability that a single particle is missed is the probability that all 20 photons fail to create a photoelectron, which is 0.9^20 ≈ 12.15%, so 1000 * 0.1215 ≈ 121.5. So approx 122. Since 130 is the closest option, answer C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering something else? For example, maybe the 10% is not per photon but overall? But no, conversion efficiency is usually per photon. For example, if the photocathode has 10% efficiency, that means each photon has 10% chance to eject an electron. Therefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the PMT needs more than one photoelectron to generate a signal? But the problem says \"assuming that one photoelectron in the tube can generate a signal\", so even one is enough. Therefore, the calculation is as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? For example, if all 20 photons are produced, and with 10% efficiency, so 2 photoelectrons on average. But if you need one, then almost all particles are detected? But no, because there is a chance that none of them are converted. For example, even with average 2, Poisson distribution has a 13.5% chance of zero. So approx 13.5% missed, which is 135, which is approx 130. So answer C.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C) 130.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
