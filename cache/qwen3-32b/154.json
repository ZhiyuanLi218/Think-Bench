The problem gives me the energy of the beam, E = 4 GeV, the mass of particle X, m_X = 1.48 GeV, and its proper lifetime τ₀ = 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ seconds. The options are given, so I need to calculate the correct distance.\n\nFirst, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes as observed in the lab frame are longer due to time dilation. The flux reduction would depend on how many particles have decayed by the time they travel a certain distance. Since the flux is proportional to the number of particles remaining, reducing to 25% means that three-quarters have decayed.\n\nThe formula for the number of particles remaining after time t is N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / τ), where τ is the dilated lifetime. But wait, actually, the decay formula is usually expressed with the mean lifetime τ or the half-life T₁/₂. Let me recall: the number of particles remaining is N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / (γ τ₀)), where γ is the Lorentz factor, and τ₀ is the proper lifetime. Because in the particle's rest frame, its lifetime is τ₀, but in the lab frame, it's γ τ₀. So the decay time in the lab frame is longer by a factor of γ.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the formula involving the half-life. But since the problem mentions τ₀, I think it's safe to stick with the mean lifetime. The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay constant λ by λ = 1/τ. So the number of particles remaining is N(t) = N₀ e^(-λ t) = N₀ e^(-t / τ). In this case, τ in the lab frame is γ τ₀.\n\nSo if I want N(t)/N₀ = 0.25, then:\n\n0.25 = e^(-t / (γ τ₀))\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nln(0.25) = - t / (γ τ₀)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nt = - γ τ₀ ln(0.25)\n\nSince ln(0.25) is ln(1/4) = -ln(4), so:\n\nt = γ τ₀ ln(4)\n\nOnce I find t, the time it takes for the number of particles to reduce to 25%, I can then find the distance traveled by the particles in that time. However, since they are moving at a relativistic speed, the distance would be d = v * t. But since v is close to c, I need to calculate v properly using the relativistic equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward way using the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. Let me recall that for a relativistic particle, the total energy E is related to the rest mass m and the Lorentz factor γ by E = γ m c². Wait, but here the energy is given in GeV, and the mass is also in GeV. Since in particle physics, units are often expressed in terms where c = 1 and sometimes even ħ = 1. So if I take E = γ m, since the units of energy and mass are both in GeV, and c² is incorporated into the units. So that would make sense.\n\nSo given E = 4 GeV, m_X = 1.48 GeV, then γ = E / (m_X c²). But if we are using units where c = 1, then γ = E / m_X. Let me confirm this. Yes, in natural units where c = 1, the relation is E = γ m. Therefore, γ = E / m = 4 / 1.48. Let me compute that value.\n\nCalculating γ:\n\nγ = 4 / 1.48 ≈ 2.7027\n\nSo γ ≈ 2.7027. Then, to find v, we can use the relation between γ and β (where β = v/c). The relation is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Solving for β:\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)\n\nLet me compute that. First compute 1/γ²:\n\nγ ≈ 2.7027\n\nγ² ≈ 7.305\n\nSo 1/γ² ≈ 0.1369\n\nTherefore, 1 - 1/γ² ≈ 1 - 0.1369 ≈ 0.8631\n\nThen β ≈ sqrt(0.8631) ≈ 0.929. So β ≈ 0.929, meaning v ≈ 0.929 c.\n\nBut maybe there's a more exact way to compute β? Let me check. Alternatively, using β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² / E²)) * c? Wait, since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². If we want to find β, which is v/c, we can use β = pc² / E. Wait, let me recall:\n\nFrom E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So solving for p:\n\np = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c\n\nBut β = v/c = pc² / E. Wait, let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, since γ = E / (m c²), and γ β = pc / (m c²), so β = pc / E.\n\nBut perhaps another approach. Let me use β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Since we already have γ ≈ 2.7027, then:\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (1/(4² / 1.48²))) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase. Since γ = E / (m c²). In natural units where c=1, E = γ m, so γ = E/m. Therefore, β = sqrt(1 - (m² / E²)).\n\nYes, since γ² = 1 / (1 - β²) => 1 - β² = 1 / γ² => β² = 1 - 1/γ² => β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). So with γ ≈ 4 / 1.48 ≈ 2.7027, then β ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/( (4/1.48)^2 )).\n\nLet me compute this more accurately. Let's compute γ first:\n\nγ = 4 / 1.48. Let me compute 4 divided by 1.48:\n\n1.48 × 2 = 2.96, 4 - 2.96 = 1.04. So 2 + 1.04 / 1.48 ≈ 2 + 0.7027 ≈ 2.7027, which matches the earlier value.\n\nSo γ ≈ 2.7027\n\nThen 1/γ² ≈ 1 / (7.305) ≈ 0.1369\n\nTherefore, 1 - 1/γ² ≈ 0.8631\n\nThen β ≈ sqrt(0.8631) ≈ 0.929. Let me check with a calculator:\n\nsqrt(0.8631) ≈ 0.929. Let me verify:\n\n0.929² = 0.863, yes. So β ≈ 0.929. Therefore, v ≈ 0.929c.\n\nBut perhaps I need a more precise value? Well, maybe for the purposes of calculating the distance, since we need to multiply v by t, and if v is close to c, maybe the approximation v ≈ c is okay? But given that β is 0.929, which is about 93% of c, so using c would overestimate the distance. However, since we have the exact value of β, we can compute it properly.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate the distance traveled without computing β and v separately. Since the particles are moving at velocity v, the distance they travel in the lab frame is d = v * t. But t is γ τ₀ ln(4), so:\n\nd = v * γ τ₀ ln(4)\n\nBut since v = β c, and β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²), then:\n\nd = β c γ τ₀ ln(4)\n\nAlternatively, since β γ = (v/c) γ = γ v / c. But γ v / c is equal to... Let me recall that γ β is equal to pc / (m c²) from earlier, but perhaps there's another way. Alternatively, let's note that:\n\nβ γ = sqrt(γ² - 1). Because:\n\nγ² β² = γ² (1 - 1/γ²) ) = γ² - 1.\n\nYes! So β γ = sqrt(γ² - 1). Therefore, d = c τ₀ γ β ln(4) = c τ₀ sqrt(γ² - 1) ln(4).\n\nSo this is a useful formula because it allows me to compute d without having to separately calculate β. Let me verify:\n\nYes, since d = v * t, and t = γ τ₀ ln(4). Then:\n\nd = v * γ τ₀ ln(4) = c β γ τ₀ ln(4) = c τ₀ γ β ln(4) = c τ₀ sqrt(γ² - 1) ln(4). Exactly.\n\nTherefore, I can compute sqrt(γ² - 1) directly from γ, which we already have.\n\nSo let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute γ ≈ 4 / 1.48 ≈ 2.7027.\n\nγ² ≈ (2.7027)^2 ≈ 7.305.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(γ² - 1) = sqrt(7.305 - 1) = sqrt(6.305) ≈ 2.511.\n\nSo sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.511.\n\nThen, putting it all together:\n\nd = c * τ₀ * sqrt(γ² - 1) * ln(4)\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\n- c is the speed of light, approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.\n\n- τ₀ is given as 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ seconds.\n\n- sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.511.\n\n- ln(4) ≈ 1.3863.\n\nSo multiplying all together:\n\nFirst, let me compute sqrt(γ² - 1) * ln(4) ≈ 2.511 * 1.3863 ≈ ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2.511 * 1.3863 ≈ 2.5 * 1.3863 + 0.011 * 1.3863 ≈ 3.46575 + 0.01525 ≈ 3.481.\n\nSo approximately 3.481.\n\nThen, multiplying by τ₀:\n\n3.481 * 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ s ≈ ?\n\nFirst compute 3.481 * 8.7:\n\nLet me calculate 3.481 * 8.7:\n\nWell, 3 * 8.7 = 26.1\n\n0.481 * 8.7 ≈ 4.1847\n\nTotal ≈ 26.1 + 4.1847 ≈ 30.2847 × 10⁻⁵ s ≈ 3.02847 × 10⁻⁴ s.\n\nThen multiply by c, which is 3 × 10^8 m/s:\n\nd ≈ 3.02847 × 10⁻⁴ s * 3 × 10^8 m/s = 9.0854 × 10^4 m ≈ 90,854 meters.\n\nWait, that's approximately 90,854 meters. Looking at the options, option D is 90954 m. So that's very close. Therefore, the answer is D?\n\nBut let me check my calculations again because approximations might have introduced some error.\n\nLet me recalculate sqrt(γ² - 1) with more precision.\n\nFirst, γ = 4 / 1.48. Let me calculate this more accurately.\n\n1.48 × 2.7 = 1.48 × 2 + 1.48 × 0.7 = 2.96 + 1.036 = 3.996. So 2.7 gives us 3.996 GeV, which is very close to 4 GeV. Therefore, γ ≈ 2.7 + (4 - 3.996)/1.48.\n\nDifference is 4 - 3.996 = 0.004 GeV. So delta γ = 0.004 / 1.48 ≈ 0.0027. Therefore, γ ≈ 2.7 + 0.0027 ≈ 2.7027, as before. So γ ≈ 2.7027.\n\nThen γ² is (2.7027)^2. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 2.7^2 = 7.29.\n\nThen, 0.0027^2 is negligible, and the cross term is 2 * 2.7 * 0.0027 ≈ 0.01458.\n\nSo total γ² ≈ 7.29 + 0.01458 ≈ 7.30458. Therefore, sqrt(γ² - 1) = sqrt(7.30458 - 1) = sqrt(6.30458). Let me compute sqrt(6.30458).\n\nI know that sqrt(6.25) = 2.5, sqrt(6.4) ≈ 2.53. Let me compute 2.51^2 = 6.3001. Wow, 2.51^2 = 6.3001. Which is very close to 6.30458. Therefore, sqrt(6.30458) ≈ 2.51 + (6.30458 - 6.3001)/(2 * 2.51). Using linear approximation.\n\nThe difference between 6.30458 and 6.3001 is 0.00448. The derivative of sqrt(x) at x=6.3001 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) = 1/(2*2.51) ≈ 0.1992. Therefore, the correction is approximately 0.00448 * 0.1992 ≈ 0.000893. Therefore, sqrt(6.30458) ≈ 2.51 + 0.000893 ≈ 2.5109. Therefore, sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.5109.\n\nSo more accurately, sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.5109.\n\nThen, ln(4) is exactly 2 ln(2) ≈ 1.386294.\n\nSo multiplying sqrt(γ² - 1) * ln(4) ≈ 2.5109 * 1.386294 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute this more accurately:\n\nFirst, 2.5 * 1.386294 = 3.465735\n\nThen, 0.0109 * 1.386294 ≈ 0.01509.\n\nAdding together: 3.465735 + 0.01509 ≈ 3.4808.\n\nSo total ≈ 3.4808.\n\nThen, multiply by τ₀ = 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ s:\n\n3.4808 * 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ s.\n\nLet me calculate 3.4808 * 8.7:\n\nFirst, 3 * 8.7 = 26.1\n\n0.4808 * 8.7:\n\nCalculate 0.4 * 8.7 = 3.48\n\n0.0808 * 8.7 ≈ 0.70296\n\nTotal ≈ 3.48 + 0.70296 ≈ 4.18296\n\nTherefore total 3.4808 * 8.7 ≈ 26.1 + 4.18296 ≈ 30.28296 × 10⁻⁵ s = 3.028296 × 10⁻⁴ s.\n\nThen multiply by c = 3 × 10^8 m/s:\n\nd = 3.028296 × 10⁻⁴ s * 3 × 10^8 m/s = 9.084888 × 10^4 m ≈ 90,849 meters.\n\nWhich is approximately 90,849 m. The closest option is D: 90954 m. The difference is about 105 meters. Hmm. Let me check if there was an error in calculation.\n\nWait, maybe my approximation of γ was too rough? Let me recalculate γ with more precision.\n\nGiven E = 4 GeV, m = 1.48 GeV, so γ = E/m = 4 / 1.48.\n\nLet me compute 4 divided by 1.48:\n\nDividing 4 by 1.48:\n\n1.48 × 2 = 2.96\n\n4 - 2.96 = 1.04\n\nBring down decimal: 1.04 / 1.48 = 0.7027...\n\nSo γ = 2.7027027...\n\nSo γ ≈ 2.7027027...\n\nTherefore, γ² = (2.7027027)^2.\n\nLet me compute this accurately:\n\nLet me write 2.7027 as 2 + 0.7 + 0.0027 = 2.7027.\n\nBut perhaps better to use (a + b)^2 where a = 2.7 and b = 0.0027.\n\n(a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².\n\na = 2.7, so a² = 7.29.\n\n2ab = 2 * 2.7 * 0.0027 = 5.4 * 0.0027 = 0.01458.\n\nb² = (0.0027)^2 ≈ 0.00000729.\n\nTherefore, γ² ≈ 7.29 + 0.01458 + 0.00000729 ≈ 7.304587.\n\nTherefore, γ² - 1 = 6.304587.\n\nThen sqrt(6.304587). Let me use a calculator-like approach.\n\nAs before, 2.51^2 = 6.3001. The value we have is 6.304587, which is 6.304587 - 6.3001 = 0.004487 above 6.3001.\n\nLet me use linear approximation again. Let f(x) = sqrt(x). At x = 6.3001, f(x) = 2.51. The derivative f’(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)) ≈ 1/(2*2.51) ≈ 0.1992.\n\nTherefore, delta x = 0.004487, so delta f ≈ 0.1992 * 0.004487 ≈ 0.000894.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(6.304587) ≈ 2.51 + 0.000894 ≈ 2.510894.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.510894.\n\nThen, multiplying by ln(4) ≈ 1.386294:\n\n2.510894 * 1.386294.\n\nLet me compute this multiplication more accurately.\n\nFirst, write 2.510894 × 1.386294.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n= 2.510894 × 1 + 2.510894 × 0.3 + 2.510894 × 0.08 + 2.510894 × 0.006 + 2.510894 × 0.000294.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use standard multiplication:\n\nLet me approximate 2.510894 × 1.386294.\n\nFirst, note that 2.510894 × 1.386294 ≈ ?\n\nAlternatively, use calculator steps:\n\nLet me approximate:\n\nLet me consider that 2.51 × 1.386 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 2.5 × 1.386 = 3.465\n\n0.01 × 1.386 = 0.01386\n\nSo total ≈ 3.465 + 0.01386 ≈ 3.47886.\n\nBut our numbers are slightly higher: 2.510894 is about 2.5109 and 1.386294 is about 1.3863.\n\nSo the exact value is slightly higher than 3.47886. Let me compute the exact value using more precise multiplication.\n\nLet me use the values:\n\nLet me take 2.510894 × 1.386294.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n= (2 + 0.5 + 0.01 + 0.000894) × (1 + 0.3 + 0.08 + 0.006 + 0.000294)\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, use decimal multiplication:\n\nLet me use the approximate decimal values:\n\nLet me take 2.5109 × 1.3863.\n\nMultiply 2.5109 × 1.3863:\n\nFirst, multiply 2.5109 × 1 = 2.5109\n\n2.5109 × 0.3 = 0.75327\n\n2.5109 × 0.08 = 0.200872\n\n2.5109 × 0.006 = 0.0150654\n\n2.5109 × 0.000294 ≈ 2.5109 × 0.0003 ≈ 0.00075327\n\nAdding all together:\n\nStart with 2.5109 + 0.75327 = 3.26417\n\nPlus 0.200872 = 3.465042\n\nPlus 0.0150654 = 3.4801074\n\nPlus 0.00075327 ≈ 3.48086067.\n\nSo total ≈ 3.48086.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(γ² - 1) * ln(4) ≈ 3.48086.\n\nThen multiply by τ₀ * c:\n\nτ₀ = 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ s\n\nSo 3.48086 × 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ × 3 × 10^8 m.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, compute 3.48086 × 8.7:\n\nAs before, 3 × 8.7 = 26.1\n\n0.48086 × 8.7 ≈ Let's calculate:\n\n0.4 × 8.7 = 3.48\n\n0.08 × 8.7 = 0.696\n\n0.00086 × 8.7 ≈ 0.007542\n\nAdding up: 3.48 + 0.696 = 4.176 + 0.007542 ≈ 4.183542\n\nTotal ≈ 26.1 + 4.183542 ≈ 30.283542\n\nTherefore, 3.48086 × 8.7 ≈ 30.283542\n\nThen multiply by 3 × 10^(-4 + 8) = 3 × 10^4:\n\nWait, original expression is 3.48086 × 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ × 3 × 10^8 = [3.48086 × 8.7 × 3] × 10^(-5 + 8) = [3.48086 × 8.7 × 3] × 10^3.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, 3.48086 × 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ × 3 × 10^8 = 3.48086 × 8.7 × 3 × 10^(-5 + 8) = 3.48086 × 8.7 × 3 × 10^3.\n\nBut earlier I calculated 3.48086 × 8.7 ≈ 30.283542, then multiply by 3:\n\n30.283542 × 3 ≈ 90.850626, then multiply by 10^3? Wait, no:\n\nWait, no, the exponents:\n\nOriginal value is 3.48086 × 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ × 3 × 10^8 = (3.48086 × 8.7 × 3) × 10^(-5 + 8) = (3.48086 × 8.7 × 3) × 10^3.\n\nBut 3.48086 × 8.7 ≈ 30.2835, then × 3 ≈ 90.8505, then × 10^3? No, wait 10^(-5 + 8) is 10^3. So 90.8505 × 10^3 = 90,850.5 meters. So approximately 90,850 meters. Which is 90.85 kilometers.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: 48635 m ≈ 48.6 km\n\nB: 17586 m ≈ 17.6 km\n\nC: 64218 m ≈ 64.2 km\n\nD: 90954 m ≈ 90.95 km\n\nOur calculation gives approximately 90,850 m, which is very close to option D (90,954 m). The difference is about 104 meters. This discrepancy might be due to rounding during the calculation steps. Let me check if there was an error in unit conversions or in the formulas.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The formula I used was:\n\nd = c * τ₀ * sqrt(γ² - 1) * ln(4)\n\nBut let me confirm that the time t is indeed γ τ₀ ln(4). Earlier, I said:\n\nN(t)/N₀ = e^(-t / (γ τ₀)) = 0.25\n\nTherefore, solving for t:\n\nt = - γ τ₀ ln(0.25) = γ τ₀ ln(4). Correct.\n\nThen distance is d = v * t. But since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²), then:\n\nd = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) * γ τ₀ ln(4) = c τ₀ ln(4) * sqrt(γ² - 1). Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the error must be due to rounding during the calculation steps. Let me try to carry out the calculation with more precise numbers.\n\nLet me recompute 3.48086 × 8.7 × 3 × 10^3? Wait no, the previous step:\n\nWait, no, the total is 3.48086 × 8.7 × 3 × 10^3? No, let me re-express:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nd = c * τ₀ * sqrt(γ² - 1) * ln(4)\n\nc = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nτ₀ = 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ s\n\nsqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.510894\n\nln(4) ≈ 1.386294\n\nSo multiplying all together:\n\nd = 3e8 * 8.7e-5 * 2.510894 * 1.386294\n\nLet me compute this step by step with more precision.\n\nFirst compute 3e8 * 8.7e-5:\n\n3e8 * 8.7e-5 = 3 * 8.7 * 1e3 = 26.1 * 1000 = 26,100 m.\n\nWait, because 3e8 * 8.7e-5 = 3 * 8.7 * 1e8 * 1e-5 = 3 * 8.7 * 1e3 = 26.1 * 1000 = 26,100 m? Wait, no:\n\nWait, 3 × 10^8 * 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ = 3 * 8.7 × 10^(8 - 5) = 26.1 × 10³ = 26,100 m.\n\nThen multiply by sqrt(γ² - 1) * ln(4) ≈ 2.510894 * 1.386294 ≈ 3.48086.\n\nTherefore, total distance d ≈ 26,100 m * 3.48086 ≈ ?\n\nCalculate 26,100 * 3.48086.\n\nFirst, compute 26,100 * 3 = 78,300\n\nThen 26,100 * 0.48086 ≈ ?\n\nCalculate 26,100 * 0.4 = 10,440\n\n26,100 * 0.08 = 2,088\n\n26,100 * 0.00086 ≈ 26,100 * 0.0008 + 26,100 * 0.00006 ≈ 20.88 + 1.566 ≈ 22.446\n\nAdding those: 10,440 + 2,088 = 12,528 + 22.446 ≈ 12,550.446\n\nTherefore total d ≈ 78,300 + 12,550.446 ≈ 90,850.446 meters ≈ 90,850 meters.\n\nWhich is about 90,850 m, as before. The given option D is 90,954 m. The difference is about 104 meters. This is likely due to rounding during intermediate steps. Perhaps the precise calculation would give a slightly higher value?\n\nLet me check if my value for sqrt(γ² - 1) was slightly underestimated. Earlier, I approximated sqrt(6.304587) as 2.510894, but let me check with more accurate calculation.\n\nLet me use the Newton-Raphson method to compute sqrt(6.304587). Let me take an initial guess of x₀ = 2.5109.\n\nCompute x₀² = (2.5109)^2.\n\nLet me calculate 2.51^2 = 6.3001, as before. Then, 2.5109^2:\n\nLet me write it as (2.51 + 0.0009)^2 = 2.51² + 2*2.51*0.0009 + (0.0009)^2 ≈ 6.3001 + 0.004518 + 0.00000081 ≈ 6.30461881.\n\nCompare to our target value of 6.304587. So x₀² ≈ 6.30461881, which is slightly larger than 6.304587. The difference is 6.30461881 - 6.304587 = 0.00003181.\n\nSo to find a better approximation, we can use Newton-Raphson:\n\nx₁ = x₀ - (x₀² - a)/(2x₀), where a = 6.304587.\n\nx₁ = 2.5109 - (6.30461881 - 6.304587)/(2 * 2.5109)\n\n= 2.5109 - (0.00003181)/(5.0218)\n\n≈ 2.5109 - 0.00000633 ≈ 2.51089367.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(6.304587) ≈ 2.51089367.\n\nSo sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.51089367.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by ln(4) ≈ 1.38629436:\n\n2.51089367 × 1.38629436.\n\nLet me use more accurate multiplication. Let me use calculator-like steps:\n\nLet me consider that 2.51089367 × 1.38629436.\n\nLet me use the fact that 2.51089367 × 1.38629436 ≈ ?\n\nLet me use decimal expansion:\n\nLet me approximate this as 2.510894 × 1.386294.\n\nUsing a calculator (pretending I have one here), but since I don't, let me use the previous approximation which gave us 3.48086. However, with the more accurate sqrt(γ² - 1), let's see:\n\nGiven that earlier with x₀ = 2.5109, the product was approx 3.48086. But with the slightly adjusted sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.51089367, which is almost the same as before, so the product would still be approximately 3.48086. Therefore, the previous calculation is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the distance is approximately 90,850 meters. Given that option D is 90,954 m, which is very close. The difference is about 104 meters. Given that the problem provides options with five significant figures (e.g., D is 90954 m), perhaps my approximated value of γ was too rough?\n\nWait, let's recalculate γ with more precision. Earlier, I approximated γ as 4 / 1.48 = 2.7027027..., but let me calculate 4 / 1.48 precisely.\n\nLet me perform the division 4 ÷ 1.48.\n\n1.48 × 2.7 = 3.996 as before.\n\nThe difference is 4 - 3.996 = 0.004.\n\nSo, 0.004 / 1.48 = 0.0027027027...\n\nTherefore, γ = 2.7 + 0.0027027027... ≈ 2.7027027027...\n\nSo γ ≈ 2.7027027...\n\nTherefore, γ² is:\n\n(2.7027027)^2. Let me calculate this with more precision.\n\nLet me write γ = 2 + 0.7 + 0.0027027.\n\nBut perhaps better to use γ = 2.7027027...\n\nLet me square it:\n\nγ² = (2.7027027)^2.\n\nLet me use the identity (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a = 2.7, b = 0.0027027.\n\na² = 7.29\n\n2ab = 2 * 2.7 * 0.0027027 = 5.4 * 0.0027027 ≈ 0.01459458\n\nb² = (0.0027027)^2 ≈ 0.000007305\n\nTherefore, γ² ≈ 7.29 + 0.01459458 + 0.000007305 ≈ 7.304601885.\n\nTherefore, γ² - 1 = 6.304601885.\n\nPreviously, we had sqrt(6.304587) ≈ 2.51089367. Now, the value is sqrt(6.304601885). The difference between 6.304601885 and 6.304587 is negligible for our purposes, so sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.510894.\n\nTherefore, the calculation remains the same. Hence, the discrepancy between our result (~90,850 m) and option D (90,954 m) is likely due to rounding during intermediate steps in the problem's expected solution, or perhaps a more precise calculation is required.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me double-check the formula.\n\nThe key formula is d = c * τ₀ * γ * β * ln(4). And since γβ = sqrt(γ² - 1), yes. Therefore, d = c * τ₀ * sqrt(γ² - 1) * ln(4). Correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's try calculating using exact expressions with the given numbers.\n\nLet me try to compute γ more accurately and then compute sqrt(γ² - 1).\n\nGiven γ = 4 / 1.48.\n\nLet me compute 4 / 1.48 exactly:\n\nLet me convert 1.48 to a fraction. 1.48 = 148/100 = 37/25.\n\nTherefore, γ = 4 / (37/25) ) = 4 * (25/37) = 100/37 ≈ 2.7027027027...\n\nTherefore, γ = 100/37 ≈ 2.7027027...\n\nThen γ² = (100/37)^2 = 10000 / 1369 ≈ 7.304601899...\n\nTherefore, γ² - 1 = (10000 - 1369)/1369 = 8631 / 1369 ≈ 6.304601899...\n\nTherefore, sqrt(γ² - 1) = sqrt(8631 / 1369) = sqrt(8631)/sqrt(1369).\n\nsqrt(1369) = 37.\n\nsqrt(8631). Let me calculate sqrt(8631).\n\nWell, 92² = 8464, 93² = 8649. So sqrt(8631) is between 92 and 93.\n\nCompute 92.9² = (92 + 0.9)^2 = 92² + 2*92*0.9 + 0.9² = 8464 + 165.6 + 0.81 = 8464 + 165.6 = 8629.6 + 0.81 = 8630.41.\n\nCompare to 8631. So 92.9² = 8630.41, difference is 8631 - 8630.41 = 0.59.\n\nLet me approximate sqrt(8631) ≈ 92.9 + 0.59/(2*92.9) ≈ 92.9 + 0.59/185.8 ≈ 92.9 + 0.00317 ≈ 92.90317.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(8631) ≈ 92.90317.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(γ² - 1) = 92.90317 / 37 ≈ 2.510896.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(γ² - 1) ≈ 2.510896.\n\nThen, multiplying by ln(4) ≈ 1.386294:\n\n2.510896 × 1.386294 ≈ ?\n\nAs calculated earlier, this is approximately 3.48086.\n\nTherefore, d = 3 × 10^8 m/s * 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ s * 3.48086.\n\nLet me compute this precisely:\n\nFirst compute 3 × 10^8 * 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ = 3 * 8.7 * 10^3 = 26.1 * 10^3 = 26,100 m.\n\nThen multiply by 3.48086:\n\n26,100 * 3.48086.\n\nLet me compute this using calculator-like steps:\n\nFirst, note that 26,100 * 3.48086 = 26,100 * (3 + 0.48 + 0.00086) = 26,100*3 + 26,100*0.48 + 26,100*0.00086.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n26,100 * 3 = 78,300\n\n26,100 * 0.48 = ?\n\nWell, 26,100 * 0.4 = 10,440\n\n26,100 * 0.08 = 2,088\n\nTotal = 10,440 + 2,088 = 12,528\n\n26,100 * 0.00086 = 26,100 * 8.6 × 10⁻⁴ = 26,100 * 8.6 / 10,000 = (26,100 / 10,000) * 8.6 = 2.61 * 8.6 ≈ 22.446\n\nAdding all together: 78,300 + 12,528 + 22.446 ≈ 90,850.446 meters.\n\nSo approximately 90,850.45 meters.\n\nGiven that option D is 90,954 meters, which is about 103.5 meters more. This suggests that perhaps there's a miscalculation, or the problem expects using a different value for c or τ₀, or perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the units again. τ₀ is given as 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ seconds. The problem says \"τ₀ = 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ s\". Yes.\n\nc is 3 × 10^8 m/s. Yes.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects using a more precise value for c, like 2.9979 × 10^8 m/s? Let me check.\n\nIf I use c = 3 × 10^8 m/s, I get approximately 90,850 m. If I use a more precise value, say c = 2.9979 × 10^8 m/s, then:\n\nd = 26,100 m * 3.48086 * (2.9979 / 3.0)\n\nBecause previously I used c = 3 × 10^8, but if the actual c is slightly less, then the distance would be slightly less. Wait, but our calculation was already under 90,954 m. If we use a lower c, it would make the distance even smaller, increasing the discrepancy. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using natural units where c=1, and converting differently?\n\nWait, in particle physics, often calculations are done in natural units where c=1, and sometimes distances are expressed in terms of ct, where t is time. But in this problem, they give τ₀ in seconds, so probably expects SI units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relation between γ and the velocity?\n\nLet me re-derive the formula for the distance. \n\nThe number of particles remaining is N(t) = N₀ e^{-t / (γ τ₀)}. We want N(t)/N₀ = 0.25, so:\n\n0.25 = e^{-t / (γ τ₀)} => t = γ τ₀ ln(4)\n\nIn the lab frame, the particles are moving at velocity v, so the distance traveled is d = v t = v γ τ₀ ln(4).\n\nBut v = c * β, where β = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Therefore:\n\nd = c * β * γ * τ₀ * ln(4) = c * τ₀ * ln(4) * γ β.\n\nAnd since γ β = sqrt(γ² - 1), then:\n\nd = c * τ₀ * ln(4) * sqrt(γ² - 1). Correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct. Therefore, the calculation should be correct. \n\nGiven that the precise calculation gives ~90,850 m and the closest option is D: 90,954 m, which is about 0.1% higher. Perhaps there is a rounding difference in the problem's given values? Let me check the given values again.\n\nThe problem states:\n\nE = 4 GeV\n\nm_X = 1.48 GeV\n\nτ₀ = 8.7 × 10⁻⁵ s.\n\nWait, maybe the mass is 1.48 GeV/c²? But in the problem statement, it's written as m{X}=1.48GeV. In particle physics, mass is often expressed in GeV/c², but when writing m in GeV, it's usually understood that it's GeV/c². However, since energy is given in GeV, and we used E = γ m (assuming c=1), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects using E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², and solving for β, perhaps there was an error in the γ calculation?\n\nLet me try this approach. Let's compute β using E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\nGiven E = 4 GeV, m = 1.48 GeV/c². Wait, if m is in GeV/c², then mc² is in GeV. So E² = (pc)² + (mc²)^2.\n\nLet me write everything in GeV:\n\nE = 4 GeV\n\nmc² = 1.48 GeV\n\nTherefore, (pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2 = (4)^2 - (1.48)^2 = 16 - 2.1904 = 13.8096 (GeV)^2.\n\nTherefore, pc = sqrt(13.8096) GeV ≈ 3.716 GeV.\n\nThen, β = pc / E = 3.716 / 4 ≈ 0.929. Which matches our previous calculation of β ≈ 0.929. So that's consistent.\n\nThen, γ = E / (mc²) = 4 / 1.48 ≈ 2.7027, as before. So no issue here.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. The only possibility is that the given answer options have rounding differences, and option D is the closest. Given that our precise calculation gives ~90,850 m and option D is 90,954 m, which is very close, it's likely that option D is the intended correct answer, considering possible rounding during the problem's creation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a factor of γ somewhere? Let me check the derivation again.\n\nThe time in the lab frame is t = γ τ₀ ln(4). The distance is d = v t. Since v = β c, then d = β c γ τ₀ ln(4). And β γ = sqrt(γ² - 1), so d = c τ₀ ln(4) sqrt(γ² - 1). Correct.\n\nYes, this is correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct. Given that, and the proximity to option D, I think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
