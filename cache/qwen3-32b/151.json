Then, I have to find the sum a + b + c. Alright, let me start by breaking down each part of the expression.\n\nFirst, let me look at the terms involving √2. There's √2 and 1/√2. Similarly, for √3, there's √3 and 1/√3. Maybe I can combine those separately first. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with √2 + 1/√2. To add these two terms together, they need a common denominator. The first term is √2, which can be written as (√2 * √2)/√2, right? Because multiplying numerator and denominator by √2 would rationalize the denominator if needed, but here I just want to express √2 with denominator √2. Wait, actually, √2 is the same as (√2 * √2)/√2? Let me check that. If I multiply numerator and denominator by √2, that would be √2 * √2 / √2, which is 2 / √2. Wait, that's not the same as √2. Hmm, maybe I confused something here.\n\nWait, actually, √2 is equal to √2/1. If I want to add it to 1/√2, I need to get a common denominator. The denominators are 1 and √2, so the common denominator is √2. Therefore, √2 can be written as (√2 * √2)/√2, because multiplying numerator and denominator by √2. Let me compute that: √2 * √2 is 2, so √2 is equal to 2/√2. Then adding 1/√2 would be 2/√2 + 1/√2 = 3/√2. Wait, but that seems correct? Let me verify with decimal values. √2 is approximately 1.414, and 1/√2 is approximately 0.707. Adding them together gives roughly 2.121. On the other hand, 3/√2 is 3 divided by 1.414, which is approximately 2.121. So that checks out. Okay, so √2 + 1/√2 = 3/√2.\n\nBut 3/√2 isn't rationalized. Usually, we rationalize denominators, but in the problem, the final expression is allowed to have radicals in the numerator. Wait, the problem says to write it as (a√2 + b√3)/c. So maybe I need to rationalize those denominators? Let me see.\n\nSo 3/√2 can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by √2: (3√2)/ (√2 * √2) = (3√2)/2. Similarly, for the √3 + 1/√3 part. Let me do the same there.\n\nStarting with √3 + 1/√3. Again, common denominator is √3. So √3 is equal to √3 * √3 / √3 = 3/√3. Then adding 1/√3 gives 3/√3 + 1/√3 = 4/√3. Rationalizing that gives 4√3 / 3.\n\nSo putting it all together, the original expression is:\n\n(3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3.\n\nNow, I need to combine these two terms into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator is 6.\n\nLet me convert each term:\n\nFor (3√2)/2, multiply numerator and denominator by 3: (3√2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = (9√2)/6.\n\nFor (4√3)/3, multiply numerator and denominator by 2: (4√3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = (8√3)/6.\n\nNow, adding them together: (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nSo, comparing to the desired form (a√2 + b√3)/c, we have a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. The problem states that c should be as small as possible. Is 6 the smallest possible denominator here?\n\nLet me check if the numerator and denominator have any common factors. The numerator is 9√2 + 8√3. Since √2 and √3 are irrational and linearly independent over the rationals, there's no way to factor out a common term from the numerator. Therefore, the fraction (9√2 + 8√3)/6 is already in its simplest form with the smallest possible denominator. Therefore, a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. Then, a + b + c is 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, but let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3.\n\nFirst, combine √2 + 1/√2:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 = ( (√2 * √2) + 1 ) / √2 = (2 + 1)/√2 = 3/√2. Then rationalizing gives 3√2 / 2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for √3 + 1/√3:\n\n√3 + 1/√3 = ( (√3 * √3) + 1 ) / √3 = (3 + 1)/√3 = 4/√3. Rationalizing gives 4√3 / 3. Correct.\n\nThen adding 3√2 / 2 + 4√3 / 3. LCD of 2 and 3 is 6. Converting:\n\n3√2 / 2 = (3√2 * 3) / 6 = 9√2 / 6.\n\n4√3 / 3 = (4√3 * 2) / 6 = 8√3 / 6.\n\nAdding gives (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Correct. So that's the expression. Since 9 and 6 have a common factor of 3, but since the numerator has 9√2 + 8√3, even if 9 and 6 have a common factor, since the other term is 8√3, which when divided by 3 would leave 8/2 √3, but 8 isn't divisible by 3. Similarly, 8 and 6 have a common factor of 2, but 9 isn't divisible by 2. Therefore, there's no common factor across all terms in the numerator and denominator. Therefore, 6 is indeed the smallest possible denominator. Therefore, a + b + c = 9 + 8 + 6 = 23. Hmm, but wait, let me check if there's another way to combine the terms that might result in a smaller denominator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine all terms from the start without splitting into √2 and √3 parts? Let me try that approach.\n\nOriginal expression: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3.\n\nLet me rationalize all the denominators first. So:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 = √2 + (√2)/2 = (2√2 + √2)/2 = 3√2 / 2, same as before.\n\nSimilarly, √3 + 1/√3 = √3 + √3/3 = (3√3 + √3)/3 = 4√3 / 3, same as before. So adding them gives the same result. So no difference in approach here.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a different combination? For example, if I didn't rationalize first? Let me see.\n\nSuppose I try to combine all four terms over a common denominator. Let me attempt that. The original expression is √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. Let me think of all terms as fractions. Let me write them all with denominator √2√3, which is √6. But that might complicate things. Let me try.\n\nFirst, √2 can be written as (√2 * √2 * √3) / (√2 * √3) = (2√3)/√6. Wait, this seems messy. Maybe not the best approach. Alternatively, let me think of denominators. The denominators in the original expression are 1, √2, 1, √3. So to combine all terms over a common denominator, we need to have denominator as the least common multiple of 1, √2, 1, √3. But LCM with radicals is not straightforward. Probably my initial approach was better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to combine √2 + √3 + 1/√2 + 1/√3. Maybe group them as (√2 + √3) + (1/√2 + 1/√3). But that might not help. Let me try.\n\nCompute 1/√2 + 1/√3. Let me rationalize them first: √2/2 + √3/3. Then adding to √2 + √3. So total expression is √2 + √3 + √2/2 + √3/3. Then combine like terms:\n\nFor √2 terms: 1√2 + (1/2)√2 = (3/2)√2.\n\nFor √3 terms: 1√3 + (1/3)√3 = (4/3)√3.\n\nWhich is the same as before: (3/2)√2 + (4/3)√3. Which again leads to the same combination over common denominator 6. Therefore, same result. So regardless of grouping, we end up with (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct: a = 9, b = 8, c = 6, so a + b + c = 23.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's a way to write this with a smaller denominator. Suppose someone claims that c can be smaller than 6, say 3 or 2. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose c = 3. Then, we need to have (a√2 + b√3)/3 equals the original expression. Let me compute the original expression's value numerically and see what (a√2 + b√3)/3 would need to be.\n\nOriginal expression: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3 ≈ 1.4142 + 0.7071 + 1.732 + 0.5774 ≈ Let me add them up:\n\n1.4142 + 0.7071 = 2.1213\n\n1.732 + 0.5774 ≈ 2.3094\n\nTotal ≈ 2.1213 + 2.3094 ≈ 4.4307.\n\nIf c = 3, then (a√2 + b√3)/3 ≈ 4.4307, so a√2 + b√3 ≈ 13.292. Let's see if integers a and b can satisfy this. Let me suppose c=3. Let me see:\n\nFrom previous calculation, we had (9√2 + 8√3)/6 ≈ (9*1.4142 + 8*1.732)/6 ≈ (12.7278 + 13.856)/6 ≈ 26.5838 / 6 ≈ 4.4306, which matches. If we want to have denominator 3, then numerator would have to be double: 26.5838 / 6 = same as 13.2919 / 3. Therefore, if we could write the numerator as a√2 + b√3 ≈ 13.2919. Let me check if there are integers a and b such that a√2 + b√3 ≈ 13.2919. Let me try with a and b such that when multiplied by √2 and √3 respectively, they add up to that.\n\nPreviously, we had a=9, b=8 gives 9√2 + 8√3 ≈ 12.7278 + 13.856 ≈ 26.5838. If we want something that's half of that (since denominator is 3 instead of 6), then 26.5838 / 2 ≈ 13.2919. But we need integers a and b such that a√2 + b√3 ≈ 13.2919. Let me try a=6 and b=5: 6*1.414 ≈ 8.485, 5*1.732 ≈ 8.66, total ≈ 17.145. Too big. How about a=4 and b=5: 4*1.414≈5.656 + 5*1.732≈8.66, total≈14.316. Still bigger. a=3, b=4: 3*1.414≈4.242 + 4*1.732≈6.928 ≈ 11.17. Too small. a=5, b=4: 5*1.414≈7.07 + 4*1.732≈6.928 ≈ 13.998. Close to 13.29. Still higher. How about a=5, b=3: 5*1.414≈7.07 + 3*1.732≈5.196 ≈ 12.266. Still lower than 13.29. Maybe a=6, b=4: 6*1.414≈8.485 + 4*1.732≈6.928 ≈ 15.413. Too big. a=4, b=4: 5.656 + 6.928≈12.584. Closer. Still lower. a=5, b=3.5? But b has to be integer. Hmm. It seems that there's no integer a and b that gives exactly 13.29... So maybe c=3 is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, trying c=2. Then the numerator would need to be (original value)*2 ≈ 4.4307*2≈8.8614. So a√2 + b√3 ≈8.8614. Let me check possible a and b. Let me try a=4, b=3: 4*1.414≈5.656 + 3*1.732≈5.196 ≈10.852. Too big. a=3, b=2: 4.242 + 3.464≈7.706. Too small. a=3, b=3: 4.242 + 5.196≈9.438. Closer. a=3, b=2.5? Not integer. a=4, b=2: 5.656 + 3.464≈9.12. Still higher than 8.86. a=2, b=3: 2.828 + 5.196≈8.024. Closer. a=2.5, b=3? Not integer. a=2, b=3. Let me compute exact value: 2√2 + 3√3 ≈ 2*1.414 + 3*1.732 ≈ 2.828 + 5.196 ≈ 8.024, which is less than 8.86. a=3, b=2: 4.242 + 3.464 ≈ 7.706. No. a=4, b=2: 5.656 + 3.464 ≈ 9.12. So between a=2, b=3 and a=3, b=2. But there's no integer combination here that gives 8.86. Therefore, c=2 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, trying c=1 would require numerator ≈4.43, but same problem. Therefore, c=6 is indeed the smallest possible denominator. Therefore, my answer of a=9, b=8, c=6 is correct, leading to a+b+c=23.\n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check if there is any other way to combine the original terms with a different approach that might lead to a smaller c. For example, suppose I don't rationalize the denominators first. Let me try that.\n\nOriginal expression: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. Let me combine √2 + 1/√2 as follows:\n\n√2 + 1/√2. Let me write both terms over √2:\n\n(√2 * √2)/√2 + 1/√2 = (2 + 1)/√2 = 3/√2. Which is same as before. Similarly for the √3 terms. So regardless, I have to rationalize to get rid of the denominator's radical, unless I leave it as 3/√2 + 4/√3. But the problem specifies that the final form is (a√2 + b√3)/c. Therefore, we need to have radicals in the numerator and rational denominator. Therefore, rationalizing is necessary. Therefore, leading to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, could we combine 3/√2 + 4/√3 over a common denominator? Let me try that. Let me see:\n\n3/√2 + 4/√3. Common denominator is √2√3 = √6. Therefore:\n\n3/√2 = (3 * √3)/√6\n\n4/√3 = (4 * √2)/√6\n\nTherefore, adding them together: [3√3 + 4√2]/√6. Then rationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √6:\n\n[ (3√3 + 4√2) * √6 ] / (√6 * √6) = [ 3√3*√6 + 4√2*√6 ] / 6.\n\nSimplify radicals:\n\n√3*√6 = √(3*6) = √18 = 3√2.\n\n√2*√6 = √(2*6) = √12 = 2√3.\n\nTherefore, numerator becomes:\n\n3*(3√2) + 4*(2√3) = 9√2 + 8√3.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is (9√2 + 8√3)/6, same as before. Therefore, regardless of the method, we end up with the same result. Therefore, confirming that a=9, b=8, c=6. Therefore, a+b+c=23.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key steps were combining the terms with common denominators, rationalizing, and then combining over a common denominator again. The numerical approximation also supports that the value is correct. Therefore, I feel confident that the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $a + b + c$ is \\boxed{23}.\n</think>"}
