Hmm, let me start by writing down the equation again to make sure I have it right. Potassium hydroxide reacting with copper sulfate to produce potassium sulfate and copper hydroxide. \n\nFirst, I should probably count the number of each atom on both sides to see where the imbalances are. Let me list them out.\n\nOn the left side (reactants):\n- Potassium (K): 1 from KOH\n- Oxygen (O): 1 from KOH, 4 from CuSO4, so total O is 5? Wait, KOH has one O, CuSO4 has four O. So total O is 5? But maybe I should count each element separately. Let me try again.\n\nLeft side:\nKOH: 1 K, 1 O, 1 H\nCuSO4: 1 Cu, 1 S, 4 O\nTotal:\nK: 1\nCu: 1\nS: 1\nO: 1 (from KOH) + 4 (from CuSO4) = 5 O\nH: 1 (from KOH)\n\nRight side (products):\nK2(SO4): 2 K, 1 S, 4 O\nCu(OH)2: 1 Cu, 2 O, 2 H\nTotal:\nK: 2\nCu: 1\nS: 1\nO: 4 (from sulfate) + 2 (from hydroxide) = 6 O\nH: 2\n\nSo comparing both sides:\n\nK: 1 vs 2 → need to balance K\nO: 5 vs 6 → maybe after balancing K\nH: 1 vs 2 → also need to balance H\nCu and S are balanced (1 each), so those are okay.\n\nStarting with K. On the left, there's 1 K in KOH. On the right, there are 2 K in K2(SO4). To balance K, I can put a coefficient of 2 in front of KOH. Let me try that:\n\n2 KOH + CuSO4 → K2(SO4) + Cu(OH)2\n\nNow let's recount:\n\nLeft side:\n2 KOH: 2 K, 2 O, 2 H\nCuSO4: 1 Cu, 1 S, 4 O\nTotal:\nK: 2\nCu: 1\nS: 1\nO: 2 (from KOH) + 4 (from CuSO4) = 6 O\nH: 2 (from KOH)\n\nRight side:\nK2(SO4): 2 K, 1 S, 4 O\nCu(OH)2: 1 Cu, 2 O, 2 H\nTotal:\nK: 2\nCu: 1\nS: 1\nO: 4 + 2 = 6\nH: 2\n\nNow checking each element:\n\nK: 2 on both sides\nCu: 1 each\nS: 1 each\nO: 6 each\nH: 2 each\n\nWait, that seems balanced already? Let me check again. Left side O is 2 (from 2 KOH) + 4 (from CuSO4) = 6. Right side O is 4 (from sulfate) + 2 (from hydroxide) = 6. Hydrogen is 2 on both. Potassium is 2 on both. Copper and sulfur are each 1. So yes, all elements are balanced. \n\nSo the balanced equation is 2 KOH + CuSO4 → K2(SO4) + Cu(OH)2. Let me just write that in the correct format with coefficients. The original equation didn't have any coefficients, so adding the 2 in front of KOH should do it. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another way. Sometimes, you can have different coefficients, but the smallest whole numbers are preferred. Here, 2, 1, 1, 1 seems correct. Let me verify once more. \n\nYes, all elements are balanced. So the balanced equation is 2KOH + CuSO4 → K2SO4 + Cu(OH)2. I think that's it. I don't see any other imbalances. The sulfate on the right is K2SO4, which is correct. Copper hydroxide is Cu(OH)2. Yep, looks good.\n</think>"}
