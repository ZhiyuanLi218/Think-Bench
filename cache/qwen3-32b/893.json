So, there's a cylindrical region with a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the cross-section, which I assume means it's either going into or out of the page if we imagine the cross-section as a circle. A particle with mass m and positive charge q enters the magnetic field along a diameter. Its velocity is v₀, and when it leaves, its direction has deviated by 60 degrees from the original direction. We need to find the magnitude of the magnetic induction, which is the magnetic field B.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a charged particle moves into a magnetic field perpendicular to its velocity, it follows a circular path. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force. The formula for the radius of the circular path is r = (m*v)/(q*B). Maybe that will come into play here.\n\nBut the particle isn't moving in a full circle, right? It's entering along a diameter, so maybe it's moving in a semicircle? But the problem says the direction deviates by 60 degrees. Hmm, so maybe it's not a semicircle. Let me visualize this. If the particle enters along a diameter, then if it were to go in a semicircle, it would exit at the opposite end of the diameter, and the deviation would be 180 degrees. But here it's only 60 degrees. So the path must be a portion of a circle.\n\nWait, but the magnetic field is only present in the cylindrical region with radius R. So the particle is moving through the magnetic field region, and the path is a circle, but only the part that fits within the cylinder. Depending on the radius of the particle's path compared to R, the particle might exit the cylinder before completing a full semicircle.\n\nSo, the key here is to figure out the relationship between the radius of the particle's circular path (which depends on B) and the radius R of the magnetic field region. The deviation angle of 60 degrees will help us find this relationship.\n\nLet me draw a diagram in my mind. The particle enters along the diameter, let's say from left to right. The magnetic field is perpendicular, so if the charge is positive, the direction of the force is given by the right-hand rule. If the magnetic field is into the page, then the particle will curve upward; if it's out of the page, it would curve downward. But since the problem says the direction deviates by 60 degrees, the exact direction might not matter, just the angle.\n\nLet me consider the magnetic field direction. Let's assume it's into the page. Then the particle curves upward. The path is a circle. The question is, how much of that circle is inside the cylindrical magnetic field region. The radius of the particle's path is r = (m*v₀)/(q*B). The radius of the cylinder is R. Depending on whether r is larger or smaller than R, the particle will exit the cylinder at some point.\n\nIf the radius of the particle's path is larger than R, then the particle will exit the cylinder before completing a semicircle. If it's smaller, maybe it would exit on the same side? Wait, but since it enters along a diameter, if the radius of the path is smaller than R, the particle would curve and exit the cylinder on the side. But if the radius is larger, then the particle would exit on the opposite side?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think geometrically. Let me consider the entry point. Suppose the particle enters at point A, which is on the left edge of the cylinder. The diameter would go from point A to point A', the opposite edge. But the particle is moving along the diameter, so entering from left to right. If the magnetic field causes it to curve, the center of its circular path will be somewhere off the diameter.\n\nLet me consider coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of the cylindrical magnetic field region is at the origin (0,0). The particle enters along the diameter, say from (-R, 0) to (R, 0). So it starts at (-R, 0) moving along the x-axis towards (R, 0). The magnetic field is perpendicular, let's say into the page (so in the -z direction). Then the force on the positive charge is given by F = q(v × B). Since v is along +x and B is -z, the cross product v × B is in the +y direction. So the force is upward, causing the particle to curve in the +y direction.\n\nTherefore, the particle will follow a circular path with radius r, curving upward. The question is, where does it exit the cylinder? The exit point will be somewhere on the boundary of the cylinder, which is the circle of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nLet me try to find the radius r of the particle's path. Let me denote the radius of the circular path as r. The center of this circular path will be at some point (h, k). Since the initial velocity is along the x-axis, and the force is upward, the center of the circle should be to the right of the initial path? Wait, no. Wait, when the particle is moving along the x-axis, the force is upward (in +y direction). Therefore, the center of the circular path should be to the left or right? The direction of the centripetal acceleration is towards the center. Since the force is upward at the initial position, the center must be above the initial point. Wait, let me think again.\n\nAt the moment the particle enters the magnetic field at (-R, 0), velocity is along +x. The force is upward (in +y direction). Therefore, the acceleration is upward. The center of the circular path is in the direction of the centripetal acceleration. Since the particle is moving along +x and the acceleration is upward, the center is located in the direction perpendicular to the velocity. Wait, the centripetal acceleration is toward the center of the circle. For a particle moving in a circle, the direction of the velocity is tangent to the circle, and the centripetal acceleration is toward the center.\n\nSo, if the particle is moving along +x, and the acceleration is upward, that means the center is above the particle's position. Therefore, the center is somewhere along the line perpendicular to the velocity at that point, which is the y-axis. Wait, the velocity is along x-axis, so the direction of the centripetal acceleration is along y-axis. Therefore, the center lies along the y-axis? Wait, no. If the particle is moving along the x-axis at (-R, 0), and the centripetal acceleration is upward (in +y direction), then the center of the circle is located in the direction of the centripetal acceleration relative to the particle's position. So, if the particle is at (-R, 0) and the acceleration is upward, then the center is at (-R, 0) + some displacement in the direction of the acceleration. However, since the particle is moving in a circle, the center must be such that the position vector from the center to the particle is perpendicular to the velocity.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use the formula for the radius. The radius of the circular path is r = mv/(qB). But we don't know B yet. However, we can relate the geometry of the problem.\n\nLet me try to find the coordinates of the center of the circular path. Let me denote the center as (x_c, y_c). The particle starts at (-R, 0) and is moving along +x. The velocity is tangent to the circle, so the radius at the point of entry is perpendicular to the velocity. Since velocity is along +x, the radius at (-R, 0) must be along +y or -y. But the direction of the force (centripetal acceleration) is upward, so the center is above the particle. Therefore, the center is at (-R, y_c) where y_c > 0. The radius of the circle is the distance from (-R, 0) to (-R, y_c), which is |y_c - 0| = y_c. Therefore, the radius r = y_c.\n\nBut also, the center is at (-R, r). Now, as the particle moves along its circular path, it will exit the magnetic field when it reaches the boundary of the cylinder, which is the circle of radius R centered at (0,0). Therefore, the exit point is where the particle's circular path intersects the cylinder's boundary again.\n\nSo, the particle's path is a circle with center at (-R, r) and radius r. Wait, no. Wait, if the center is at (-R, r), then the distance from the center to the origin (0,0) is sqrt[ (-R - 0)^2 + (r - 0)^2 ] = sqrt(R² + r²). But the particle's path is a circle of radius r. The intersection points between this circle and the cylinder's boundary (radius R) would be the entry point (-R, 0) and the exit point somewhere else.\n\nTo find the exit point, we can solve the equations of the two circles: the cylinder's boundary x² + y² = R² and the particle's path (x + R)^2 + (y - r)^2 = r².\n\nExpanding the particle's path equation: (x + R)^2 + (y - r)^2 = r² => x² + 2R x + R² + y² - 2 r y + r² = r² => x² + 2R x + R² + y² - 2 r y = 0.\n\nBut since the cylinder's equation is x² + y² = R², substitute that into the above equation:\n\nR² + 2R x - 2 r y = 0 => 2R x - 2 r y = - R² => R x - r y = - R² / 2.\n\nSo, the exit point lies on both the cylinder and this line R x - r y = - R² / 2. We already know one solution is (-R, 0):\n\nPlug in x = -R, y = 0: R*(-R) - r*0 = -R², which equals -R² / 2? No, unless R² = 0, which isn't the case. Wait, that suggests a mistake in my derivation.\n\nWait, let's check the expansion again. Let me redo the expansion of the particle's path equation:\n\nOriginal equation: (x + R)^2 + (y - r)^2 = r²\n\nExpanding:\n\n(x² + 2R x + R²) + (y² - 2 r y + r²) = r²\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² + 2R x + R² + y² - 2 r y + r² = r²\n\nSubtract r² from both sides:\n\nx² + 2R x + R² + y² - 2 r y = 0\n\nNow, since x² + y² = R² (from the cylinder), substitute:\n\nR² + 2R x + R² - 2 r y = 0 => 2 R² + 2 R x - 2 r y = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nR² + R x - r y = 0 => R x - r y = - R²\n\nAh, so my previous step had a mistake. It should be R x - r y = - R². Now, plugging in (-R, 0):\n\nR*(-R) - r*0 = -R² - 0 = -R², which matches the right-hand side. So that's correct. Therefore, the exit point is another intersection point.\n\nSo, we need to solve for x and y such that:\n\n1. x² + y² = R² (cylinder boundary)\n\n2. R x - r y = - R² (line from intersection)\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for x or y. Let me solve for x:\n\nR x = r y - R² => x = (r y - R²)/R\n\nNow substitute into equation 1:\n\n[(r y - R²)/R]^2 + y² = R²\n\nLet me compute [(r y - R²)/R]^2:\n\n= [ (r y - R²)^2 ] / R²\n\nSo:\n\n[ (r y - R²)^2 ] / R² + y² = R²\n\nMultiply both sides by R² to eliminate denominators:\n\n(r y - R²)^2 + R² y² = R^4\n\nExpand (r y - R²)^2:\n\n= r² y² - 2 r y R² + R^4\n\nSo:\n\nr² y² - 2 r y R² + R^4 + R² y² = R^4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(r² y² + R² y²) - 2 r y R² + R^4 = R^4\n\nFactor y²:\n\ny² (r² + R²) - 2 r y R² + R^4 = R^4\n\nSubtract R^4 from both sides:\n\ny² (r² + R²) - 2 r y R² = 0\n\nFactor:\n\ny [ y (r² + R²) - 2 r R² ] = 0\n\nTherefore, two solutions:\n\n1. y = 0, which corresponds to the entry point (-R, 0)\n\n2. y (r² + R²) - 2 r R² = 0 => y = [2 r R²] / (r² + R²)\n\nSo, the exit point has y-coordinate y = [2 r R²]/(r² + R²). Now, let's find the x-coordinate using equation 2:\n\nx = (r y - R²)/R = [ r * (2 r R² / (r² + R²)) - R² ] / R\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n= [ 2 r² R² / (r² + R²) - R² ] \n\n= [ 2 r² R² - R² (r² + R²) ] / (r² + R²)\n\n= [ 2 r² R² - r² R² - R^4 ] / (r² + R²)\n\n= [ r² R² - R^4 ] / (r² + R²)\n\n= R² (r² - R²) / (r² + R²)\n\nTherefore, x = [ R² (r² - R²) / (r² + R²) ] / R = R (r² - R²) / (r² + R²)\n\nTherefore, the exit point coordinates are:\n\nx = R (r² - R²)/(r² + R²), y = 2 r R²/(r² + R²)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle of deviation. The particle enters along the x-axis (from (-R,0) to (R,0)), so the initial velocity direction is along +x. Upon exiting, its velocity direction is tangent to the circular path at the exit point. The velocity direction is perpendicular to the radius vector from the center of the particle's path to the exit point.\n\nThe center of the particle's path is at (-R, r). Wait, earlier we said that the center is at (-R, r)? Wait, earlier when we considered the radius at entry point (-R, 0), we said that the center is at (-R, r), because the radius is vertical. Wait, let me confirm.\n\nEarlier, we thought that at the entry point (-R, 0), the radius is vertical, since the velocity is horizontal. Therefore, the center of the circle is directly above (-R, 0) at (-R, r), where r is the radius of the circular path. Therefore, yes, the center is at (-R, r). Therefore, the radius vector from the center to the exit point is (x - (-R), y - r) = (x + R, y - r). The velocity is tangent to the circle, so it is perpendicular to this radius vector. Therefore, the direction of velocity is along (- (y - r), x + R) or something like that. Wait, the velocity direction is tangent to the circle, so if the radius vector is (Δx, Δy), then the tangent is (-Δy, Δx) or (Δy, -Δx). Depending on the direction of motion.\n\nSince the particle is moving in a circle with center at (-R, r), and initially moving to the right (along +x), then the direction of motion is clockwise or counterclockwise? Let me think. If the magnetic field is into the page, then a positive charge moving to the right experiences an upward force, which would make it turn upward, implying counterclockwise motion? Wait, if you have a positive charge moving to the right in a magnetic field into the page, the force is up, so it curves upward, which would be counterclockwise if looking from above. Wait, but the center is above the entry point. So if the center is at (-R, r), then moving from (-R, 0) upward along the circle. So yes, counterclockwise. Therefore, the velocity at any point is tangent to the circle in the counterclockwise direction.\n\nTherefore, the velocity direction at the exit point is perpendicular to the radius vector pointing from the center (-R, r) to the exit point (x, y). The radius vector is (x - (-R), y - r) = (x + R, y - r). The tangent vector (velocity direction) would be (- (y - r), x + R). Because if the radius vector is (a, b), then a perpendicular vector is (-b, a). So, the velocity direction is along (- (y - r), x + R). Therefore, the direction of velocity is given by the vector (- (y - r), x + R).\n\nThe initial velocity direction was along (1, 0). The final velocity direction is along (- (y - r), x + R). The angle between these two vectors is 60 degrees. Therefore, we can use the dot product to find the angle between them.\n\nThe formula for the angle θ between vectors u and v is:\n\ncosθ = (u · v)/(|u| |v|)\n\nHere, θ is 60 degrees, u is the initial velocity vector (1, 0), and v is the final velocity vector (- (y - r), x + R). Since both vectors are direction vectors, their magnitudes are 1 and sqrt[ (- (y - r))² + (x + R)² ].\n\nBut wait, the velocity vector's magnitude is the same as the initial speed because magnetic fields don't do work. However, since we are only interested in the direction, we can use the direction vector. However, note that the magnitude of the final velocity vector is sqrt[ (- (y - r))² + (x + R)² ] which is equal to the radius of the circular path, r. Wait, because the radius vector is (x + R, y - r), and the tangent vector is (- (y - r), x + R), whose magnitude is sqrt[ (y - r)^2 + (x + R)^2 ] = sqrt(r²) = r. Therefore, the magnitude of the velocity vector is r? Wait, no. Wait, the velocity magnitude is v₀, which is constant. Wait, there's confusion here.\n\nWait, the velocity vector is tangent to the circle, and its magnitude is v₀. The vector (- (y - r), x + R) is a direction vector, but its magnitude is r. Therefore, the actual velocity vector is v₀ times the unit vector in that direction. However, for the purpose of calculating the angle between the initial direction (along (1, 0)) and the final direction, we can use the direction vector.\n\nBut let's proceed with the dot product. Let me denote vector u = (1, 0) and vector v = (- (y - r), x + R). The dot product u · v = (1)(- (y - r)) + (0)(x + R) = - (y - r). The magnitude of u is 1, and the magnitude of v is sqrt[ (- (y - r))² + (x + R)^2 ] = sqrt[ (y - r)^2 + (x + R)^2 ] = r, as the radius of the circular path.\n\nTherefore, cosθ = [ - (y - r) ] / (1 * r) = [ r - y ] / r.\n\nGiven that θ is 60 degrees, so cos(60°) = 0.5. Therefore:\n\n[ r - y ] / r = 0.5 => r - y = 0.5 r => y = 0.5 r.\n\nBut earlier, we found that at the exit point, y = [2 r R²]/(r² + R²). Therefore:\n\n[2 r R²]/(r² + R²) = 0.5 r\n\nMultiply both sides by (r² + R²):\n\n2 r R² = 0.5 r (r² + R²)\n\nDivide both sides by r (assuming r ≠ 0):\n\n2 R² = 0.5 (r² + R²)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n4 R² = r² + R² => 4 R² - R² = r² => 3 R² = r² => r = R√3\n\nSo, the radius of the particle's path is r = √3 R.\n\nBut we also know from the formula for the radius of the circular path:\n\nr = (m v₀)/(q B)\n\nTherefore:\n\n√3 R = (m v₀)/(q B) => B = (m v₀)/(q √3 R) = (m v₀)/(√3 q R)\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is (√3 m v₀)/(3 q R). Since √3 / 3 is 1/√3, so (m v₀)/(√3 q R) is equivalent to (√3 m v₀)/(3 q R). Therefore, option A.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me re-express B:\n\nB = (m v₀) / (q r) = (m v₀) / [ q (√3 R) ] = m v₀ / (q √3 R) = multiply numerator and denominator by √3: [ m v₀ √3 ] / ( q * 3 R ) = √3 m v₀ / (3 q R ), which is option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Let me check if I made any mistakes in the steps.\n\nFirst, the exit point y-coordinate was found to be 2 r R²/(r² + R²). Then we set that equal to 0.5 r, leading to 2 r R²/(r² + R²) = 0.5 r. Then solving gives r² = 3 R². That seems correct. Then substituting into r = m v₀/(q B) gives B = m v₀/(q r) = m v₀/(q R √3), which is equivalent to option A. So yes, option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check if the angle calculation was correct. The angle between the initial direction (along x-axis) and the final direction. The dot product gave us cosθ = (r - y)/r. Since θ is 60 degrees, cosθ is 0.5. Therefore, (r - y)/r = 0.5 => y = 0.5 r. That seems correct because if the exit point's y-coordinate is half the radius of the particle's path, then the angle between the initial direction and the final direction is 60 degrees. Let me visualize this. If the particle's path has radius √3 R, then the center is at (-R, √3 R). The exit point is at (x, y) where y = 0.5 * √3 R. Let me compute x:\n\nFrom earlier, x = R (r² - R²)/(r² + R²). Since r² = 3 R²:\n\nx = R (3 R² - R²)/(3 R² + R²) = R (2 R²)/(4 R²) = R*(2/4) = R/2.\n\nTherefore, exit point is at (R/2, (√3 / 2) R). Therefore, coordinates (R/2, (√3 / 2) R). The vector from the center of the cylinder (origin) to the exit point is (R/2, (√3 / 2) R), which makes a 60-degree angle with the x-axis. Wait, that's interesting. The exit point is at angle 60 degrees from the x-axis. However, the velocity direction is tangent to the particle's path at that point.\n\nWait, but the velocity direction is not the same as the position vector from the origin. The velocity direction is tangent to the particle's circular path. Let me confirm the velocity direction. The center of the particle's path is at (-R, √3 R). The exit point is at (R/2, (√3 / 2) R). The radius vector from the center to the exit point is:\n\n(R/2 - (-R), (√3 / 2 R - √3 R)) = (R/2 + R, (√3 / 2 R - √3 R)) = (3R/2, -√3 / 2 R)\n\nTherefore, the radius vector is (3R/2, -√3 R / 2). A perpendicular vector would be (√3 R / 2, 3R / 2) or (-√3 R / 2, -3R / 2). Since the motion is counterclockwise, the velocity direction should be such that it's counterclockwise around the center. Let me see. The radius vector is pointing from the center (-R, √3 R) to the exit point (R/2, √3 R / 2), which is to the right and downward. Therefore, the tangent direction counterclockwise would be to the left and upward? Wait, if the radius vector is pointing to the right and down from the center, then counterclockwise direction would be up and left? Let me use the perpendicular vector. The perpendicular vector is (-(-√3 R / 2), 3R / 2)? Wait, earlier we had that the tangent vector is (- (y - r), x + R). Let me compute that.\n\nAt the exit point, y = √3 R / 2, and r = √3 R. Therefore, y - r = (√3 R / 2 - √3 R) = -√3 R / 2. Then - (y - r) = √3 R / 2. Also, x + R = R/2 + R = 3R/2. Therefore, the tangent vector is (√3 R / 2, 3R / 2). Therefore, the direction of velocity is along (√3 / 2, 3/2). If we normalize this vector, it's direction makes an angle φ with the x-axis where tanφ = (3/2) / (√3 / 2) ) = 3 / √3 = √3. Therefore φ = 60 degrees above the x-axis? Wait tanφ = √3 implies φ = 60 degrees. Wait, but the initial direction was along +x, and the final direction is at +60 degrees from x-axis. Therefore, the deviation is 60 degrees, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, this checks out.\n\nTherefore, our calculation is correct. The radius of the particle's path is √3 R, leading to B = m v₀ / (q √3 R) = √3 m v₀ / (3 q R), which is option A. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\n(A) √3 m v₀ / 3 q R\n\n(B) m v₀ / q R\n\n(C) √3 m v₀ / q R\n\n(D) 3 m v₀ / q R\n\nYes, option A is correct. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
