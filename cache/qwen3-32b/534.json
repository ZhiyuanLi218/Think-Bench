I need to find the gravitational acceleration on the surface of a black hole with radius 45 km. The problem gives me a relation between mass and radius: M/R = c²/(2G). Hmm. So first, maybe I should figure out the mass of the black hole using that equation, and then use the formula for gravitational acceleration at the surface?\n\nAlright, gravitational acceleration on the surface of a black hole would be similar to Newton's law of gravitation, right? So the formula is g = GM/R². But since they gave me M/R = c²/(2G), maybe I can use that to substitute for M in the gravitational acceleration formula.\n\nLet me write down the given relation:\n\nM/R = c²/(2G) ⇒ M = R c²/(2G)\n\nThen plug that into g = GM/R².\n\nSo substituting M:\n\ng = G*(R c²/(2G)) / R²\n\nSimplify that. The G in the numerator cancels with the G in the denominator, and one R in the numerator cancels with R² in the denominator:\n\ng = (R c² / 2) / R² = c²/(2R)\n\nOh, interesting! So the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the black hole is c squared divided by twice the radius. That seems right? Let me check the units. c is in m/s, so c² is m²/s². Divide by R, which is in meters, so overall units are m/s², which is correct for acceleration. Okay, that seems to make sense.\n\nSo then, I need to compute c²/(2R). Given that R is 45 km, which is 45,000 meters. Let me recall the value of the speed of light c. Approximately 3×10^8 m/s. Let me use exact value? Well, since the problem is asking for an order of magnitude, maybe approximate values are okay.\n\nSo c ≈ 3×10^8 m/s. Therefore c² is 9×10^16 m²/s². Then R is 45×10³ m. Let me compute 2R: 2×45×10³ = 90×10³ m = 9×10^4 m.\n\nSo then g = (9×10^16) / (9×10^4) = 1×10^12 m/s². So that would be 10^12, which is option C. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, let me do the exact calculation step by step to be precise. Maybe I approximated too much?\n\nFirst, c is exactly 299,792,458 m/s, but for estimation purposes, 3×10^8 is fine. Let's stick with that. So c² is (3×10^8)^2 = 9×10^16 m²/s². R is 45 km = 45,000 m = 4.5×10^4 m. Then 2R is 9×10^4 m. Then g = c²/(2R) = 9×10^16 / 9×10^4 = 1×10^12 m/s². So that's exactly 10^12, which is option C.\n\nBut let me check if I did the substitution correctly. The original formula was M/R = c²/(2G). So solving for M gives M = R c²/(2G). Then gravitational acceleration is GM/R². Let me substitute M:\n\ng = G*(R c²/(2G))/R² = (R c²)/(2 R²) = c²/(2R). Yes, that's correct. So the formula is right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recall that the Schwarzschild radius is given by R_s = 2GM/c². So if we solve that for M, we get M = R_s c²/(2G). Which is exactly the same as the formula given here. Therefore, this radius given here R is the Schwarzschild radius? Because the formula matches. Therefore, the radius given here is the Schwarzschild radius, which is the event horizon of the black hole. So the gravitational acceleration at the event horizon is c²/(2R). Which is what we used. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo then with R = 45 km, the calculation gives 1×10^12 m/s². Therefore, the answer is option C.\n\nBut let me check again the numbers with more precise calculation. Maybe the radius is 45 km, which is 45,000 m. Let me compute 2R = 90,000 m. Then c² is 9×10^16 m²/s². Divided by 9×10^4 m gives 1×10^12 m/s². So yes, exactly 10^12. So answer C.\n\nAlternatively, if I use more precise numbers:\n\nc = 3.00×10^8 m/s. So c² is 9.00×10^16 m²/s².\n\nR = 45 km = 4.5×10^4 m.\n\nSo 2R = 9.0×10^4 m.\n\nTherefore, g = 9.0×10^16 / 9.0×10^4 = 1.0×10^12 m/s². Yep. So answer is C.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to think about this. For example, Earth's gravitational acceleration is about 9.8 m/s². A black hole's gravity at the surface (event horizon) should be extremely large, so 10^12 is plausible? Let's see. For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth would be about 9 mm. If we compute the gravitational acceleration at the Schwarzschild radius for Earth, using this formula, it would be c²/(2R). Let's see, with R = 9 mm = 9×10^-3 m. Then g would be (9×10^16)/(2×9×10^-3) = (9×10^16)/(1.8×10^-2) = 5×10^18 m/s². Which is extremely large, as expected. So for a black hole with larger radius, like 45 km, the acceleration would be smaller than that, but still huge. So 10^12 seems reasonable. For example, stellar-mass black holes have Schwarzschild radii on the order of kilometers. For example, a 10 solar mass black hole would have a Schwarzschild radius of about 30 km (since Schwarzschild radius is about 3 km per solar mass). So 45 km would correspond to 15 solar masses, which is reasonable for a stellar black hole. And the acceleration here is 10^12 m/s². Let me compare with the surface gravity of a black hole. Wait, but in general relativity, the surface gravity of a black hole is actually a bit different, but since this problem is using Newtonian formula, we can stick with our calculation. The problem gives us a Newtonian relation between M and R (the Schwarzschild radius is from general relativity, but the formula given here is M/R = c²/(2G), which is exactly the Schwarzschild radius formula rearranged. The Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2GM/c² ⇒ M/R_s = c²/(2G). So the problem is giving us that the radius R is the Schwarzschild radius. Therefore, even though in general relativity the surface gravity is different, here we are to compute the Newtonian gravitational acceleration at that radius, so our calculation is valid in the context of the problem.\n\nTherefore, answer is C, 10^12 m/s².\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
