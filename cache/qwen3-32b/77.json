Let me start by writing down the equation and then count the number of each atom on both sides.\n\nFirst, let me note the compounds involved. On the left side, there's CH3CH2COOH, which is propanoic acid, and Ca(OH)2, calcium hydroxide. On the right side, the products are C6H10CaO4 and H2O. I think C6H10CaO4 is probably calcium propanoate, which would make sense because propanoic acid reacting with calcium hydroxide would form a calcium salt. Let me confirm that. Calcium propanoate would have the formula Ca(C3H5O2)2. Let's see: calcium has a +2 charge, and each propanoate ion is -1, so two propanoate ions are needed. The propanoate ion is C3H5O2^- (from CH3CH2COO^-). So combining with Ca^2+, the formula would be Ca(C3H5O2)2. Let's check the formula given in the problem: C6H10CaO4. If each propanoate is C3H5O2, then two of them would be C6H10O4. So the formula C6H10CaO4 is correct. That makes sense.\n\nSo the reaction is between propanoic acid and calcium hydroxide to produce calcium propanoate and water. Now, let's balance the equation step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write the unbalanced equation again:\n\nCH3CH2COOH + Ca(OH)2 → Ca(C3H5O2)2 + H2O\n\nWait, the product in the problem is written as C6H10CaO4. Let me confirm that. If each propanoate is C3H5O2, then two would be C6H10O4. Adding the calcium, it's C6H10CaO4. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count each element on both sides.\n\nLeft side (reactants):\n\n- Carbon (C): In CH3CH2COOH, there are 3 carbons in the propanoic acid. Let me count: CH3 is 3 H and 1 C, then CH2 is 2 H and 1 C, then COOH is another C. So total in CH3CH2COOH: 3 C. Wait, actually, CH3CH2COOH is CH3-CH2-COOH. Let's count:\n\n- CH3: 3 H, 1 C\n\n- CH2: 2 H, 1 C\n\n- COOH: C (1), O (2), H (2). So total for COOH: 1 C, 2 O, 2 H.\n\nSo total carbons in CH3CH2COOH: 1 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH2) + 1 (from COOH) = 3 C. So each propanoic acid molecule has 3 C. So in the left side, per molecule of CH3CH2COOH, there are 3 C. Then, since there's also Ca(OH)2, which has no carbon. So total C on left is 3 (from CH3CH2COOH) + 0 (from Ca(OH)2) = 3 C.\n\nOn the right side, the product C6H10CaO4 has 6 C. So if we have one molecule of C6H10CaO4, that's 6 C. So to balance carbon, we need 2 molecules of CH3CH2COOH because 2 × 3 C = 6 C. So that would give 6 C on the left. Let me note that.\n\nSo maybe the coefficient for CH3CH2COOH is 2, and for C6H10CaO4 is 1. Let me check.\n\nSo tentative coefficients:\n\n2 CH3CH2COOH + Ca(OH)2 → C6H10CaO4 + H2O\n\nNow let's check other elements.\n\nCalcium (Ca): On left, 1 from Ca(OH)2. On right, 1 in C6H10CaO4. So that's balanced.\n\nHydroxide (OH): In Ca(OH)2, there are 2 OH groups. Each OH has 1 O and 1 H. Let me count the O and H from Ca(OH)2.\n\nBut maybe better to check each element step by step.\n\nOxygen (O):\n\nLeft side:\n\nIn CH3CH2COOH: Each molecule has 2 O (from COOH). So 2 molecules would have 4 O. From Ca(OH)2: each OH has 1 O, so 2 OH gives 2 O. Total O on left: 4 + 2 = 6 O.\n\nRight side:\n\nC6H10CaO4 has 4 O. Water (H2O) has 1 O per molecule. Let's say there's 'a' molecules of H2O. So total O on right: 4 + a.\n\nSo 6 = 4 + a ⇒ a = 2. So we need 2 H2O. Let me adjust that.\n\nSo now, tentative equation:\n\n2 CH3CH2COOH + Ca(OH)2 → C6H10CaO4 + 2 H2O\n\nNow check hydrogen.\n\nHydrogen (H):\n\nLeft side:\n\nIn 2 CH3CH2COOH:\n\nEach CH3CH2COOH has:\n\nCH3: 3 H\n\nCH2: 2 H\n\nCOOH: 2 H (from the -COOH group). Wait, let me recount the H in CH3CH2COOH.\n\nCH3CH2COOH is CH3-CH2-COOH. Let's break it down:\n\n- The first CH3 group: 3 H\n\n- The CH2 group: 2 H\n\n- The COOH group: the -COOH has -COOH which is -C(=O)OH. So in the COOH group, there are two H's: one from the -OH and one from the -COO? Wait, no. The COOH group is -COOH, which is -C(=O)OH. So each COOH group has 2 H's? Wait, actually, the structure is -C(=O)-OH. So the COOH group has one H attached to the oxygen (the hydroxyl H). So in the molecule CH3CH2COOH, the COOH group has one H. So total H in the molecule:\n\nCH3: 3 H\n\nCH2: 2 H\n\nCOOH: 1 H (from the -OH group)\n\nSo total H in one CH3CH2COOH molecule: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 H. Therefore, 2 molecules would have 2×6 = 12 H.\n\nFrom Ca(OH)2: each OH has 1 H, so 2 OH groups give 2×1 = 2 H. So total H on left: 12 + 2 = 14 H.\n\nRight side:\n\nC6H10CaO4: Let's count H. The formula is C6H10CaO4. So 10 H.\n\nIn 2 H2O: each H2O has 2 H, so 2×2 = 4 H.\n\nTotal H on right: 10 + 4 = 14 H. Perfect, that's balanced.\n\nNow check oxygen again to confirm.\n\nLeft side: 2 CH3CH2COOH have 2×2 = 4 O (each has 2 O in COOH), and Ca(OH)2 has 2 O (from 2 OH). Total 4 + 2 = 6 O.\n\nRight side: C6H10CaO4 has 4 O, and 2 H2O have 2×1 = 2 O. Total 4 + 2 = 6 O. Balanced.\n\nCalcium is already balanced (1 on each side).\n\nCarbon: 2×3 = 6 on left, 6 on right. Balanced.\n\nHydrogen is balanced as checked. So all elements are balanced. Therefore, the balanced equation is:\n\n2 CH3CH2COOH + Ca(OH)2 → C6H10CaO4 + 2 H2O\n\nLet me just write it with the correct formulas as given in the problem. The problem's product is written as C6H10CaO4, which is the same as Ca(C3H5O2)2. So the balanced equation is as above.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check each element once more.\n\nCarbon: 2×3 = 6 on left, 6 on right. Good.\n\nHydrogen: left 14, right 14. Good.\n\nOxygen: left 6, right 6. Good.\n\nCalcium: 1 each. Good.\n\nYes, looks balanced. So the coefficients are 2 for CH3CH2COOH, 1 for Ca(OH)2, 1 for C6H10CaO4, and 2 for H2O.\n</think>"}
