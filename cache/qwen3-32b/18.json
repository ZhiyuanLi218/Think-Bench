Then express the length as m/n and find m + n. Alright, let's start.\n\nFirst, since R is the midpoint of PQ, I can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint formula says that the coordinates of the midpoint are the averages of the coordinates of the endpoints. So, if P has coordinates (x1, y1) and Q has coordinates (x2, y2), then the midpoint M is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). In this case, M is R=(8,6). Therefore:\n\n(x1 + x2)/2 = 8 and (y1 + y2)/2 = 6.\n\nSo, x1 + x2 = 16 and y1 + y2 = 12.\n\nNow, since P lies on the line 8y = 15x, its coordinates must satisfy that equation. Similarly, Q lies on 10y = 3x, so its coordinates satisfy that equation. Let me write that down:\n\nFor point P: 8y1 = 15x1.\n\nFor point Q: 10y2 = 3x2.\n\nSo, I have these equations:\n\n1. x1 + x2 = 16\n\n2. y1 + y2 = 12\n\n3. 8y1 = 15x1\n\n4. 10y2 = 3x2\n\nSo, I need to solve these equations to find x1, y1, x2, y2, and then compute the distance between P and Q.\n\nLet me express y1 and y2 from equations 3 and 4 in terms of x1 and x2.\n\nFrom equation 3: y1 = (15/8)x1.\n\nFrom equation 4: y2 = (3/10)x2.\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into equation 2:\n\n(15/8)x1 + (3/10)x2 = 12.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. x1 + x2 = 16\n\n2. (15/8)x1 + (3/10)x2 = 12\n\nSo, I can solve this system of equations for x1 and x2.\n\nLet me write equation 2 as fractions to make it easier. Let me find a common denominator for 8 and 10, which is 40. Multiply both sides of equation 2 by 40 to eliminate denominators:\n\n40*(15/8)x1 + 40*(3/10)x2 = 40*12\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n40*(15/8) = 5*15 = 75\n\n40*(3/10) = 4*3 = 12\n\n40*12 = 480\n\nTherefore, equation 2 becomes:\n\n75x1 + 12x2 = 480.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nEquation 1: x1 + x2 = 16\n\nEquation 2: 75x1 + 12x2 = 480\n\nNow, let's solve this system. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can express x2 = 16 - x1. Then substitute into equation 2.\n\nSo:\n\n75x1 + 12*(16 - x1) = 480\n\nCompute:\n\n75x1 + 192 - 12x1 = 480\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(75x1 - 12x1) + 192 = 480\n\n63x1 + 192 = 480\n\nSubtract 192 from both sides:\n\n63x1 = 480 - 192 = 288\n\nTherefore, x1 = 288 / 63.\n\nSimplify this fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 9:\n\n288 ÷ 9 = 32\n\n63 ÷ 9 = 7\n\nSo, x1 = 32/7.\n\nThen x2 = 16 - x1 = 16 - 32/7. Let me compute that:\n\nConvert 16 to 112/7, so 112/7 - 32/7 = 80/7. Therefore, x2 = 80/7.\n\nNow, let's find y1 and y2.\n\nFrom earlier, y1 = (15/8)x1 = (15/8)*(32/7). Let me compute that:\n\nMultiply numerators: 15*32 = 480\n\nMultiply denominators: 8*7 = 56\n\nSo y1 = 480/56. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 480 ÷ 8 = 60, 56 ÷ 8 = 7. So y1 = 60/7.\n\nSimilarly, y2 = (3/10)x2 = (3/10)*(80/7). Compute that:\n\nMultiply numerators: 3*80 = 240\n\nMultiply denominators: 10*7 = 70\n\nSo y2 = 240/70. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 24/7. Wait, 240 ÷ 10 = 24, 70 ÷ 10 = 7. So y2 = 24/7.\n\nLet me check if y1 + y2 equals 12:\n\n60/7 + 24/7 = 84/7 = 12. Yes, that checks out. Good.\n\nSo coordinates of P are (x1, y1) = (32/7, 60/7), and coordinates of Q are (x2, y2) = (80/7, 24/7).\n\nNow, need to compute the distance between P and Q.\n\nDistance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].\n\nCompute x2 - x1: 80/7 - 32/7 = 48/7.\n\nCompute y2 - y1: 24/7 - 60/7 = -36/7.\n\nTherefore, the distance PQ is sqrt[(48/7)^2 + (-36/7)^2] = sqrt[(2304/49) + (1296/49)] = sqrt[(2304 + 1296)/49] = sqrt[3600/49] = sqrt(3600)/sqrt(49) = 60/7.\n\nWait, so PQ is 60/7? But the problem says \"the length of PQ equals m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n.\" So 60 and 7 are coprime, so m=60, n=7, m + n=67. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, solving for x1 and x2:\n\nFrom x1 + x2 = 16 and 75x1 + 12x2 = 480.\n\nSubstituted x2 = 16 - x1 into the second equation:\n\n75x1 + 12*(16 - x1) = 75x1 + 192 - 12x1 = 63x1 + 192 = 480.\n\n63x1 = 288 => x1 = 288/63 = 32/7. Correct. Then x2 = 16 - 32/7 = 80/7. Correct.\n\nThen y1 = 15/8 * x1 = 15/8 * 32/7. 32 divided by 8 is 4, so 15*4 = 60, over 7. Correct. y1 = 60/7.\n\nSimilarly, y2 = 3/10 * x2 = 3/10 * 80/7. 80 divided by 10 is 8, so 3*8 = 24 over 7. Correct. y2 = 24/7. Then y1 + y2 is 84/7 = 12, which matches. So coordinates are correct.\n\nThen distance between P(32/7, 60/7) and Q(80/7, 24/7):\n\nDifference in x: 80/7 - 32/7 = 48/7.\n\nDifference in y: 24/7 - 60/7 = -36/7.\n\nSquares: (48/7)^2 = (48^2)/49. 48 squared is 2304. (-36)^2 is 1296. Sum is 2304 + 1296 = 3600. So sqrt(3600/49) is 60/7. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo PQ is 60/7. Therefore m = 60, n = 7, m + n = 67. So the answer is 67. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes there's a trick.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the lines whose equations are 8y = 15x and 10y = 3x contain points P and Q, respectively...\" So P is on 8y=15x, Q on 10y=3x. We found coordinates of P and Q. Let me check if they are actually on those lines.\n\nFor P(32/7, 60/7): 8y = 8*(60/7) = 480/7. 15x = 15*(32/7) = 480/7. So yes, 8y = 15x. Correct.\n\nFor Q(80/7, 24/7): 10y = 10*(24/7) = 240/7. 3x = 3*(80/7) = 240/7. So yes, 10y = 3x. Correct. So coordinates are correct.\n\nMidpoint is ((32/7 + 80/7)/2, (60/7 + 24/7)/2) = (112/7 / 2, 84/7 / 2) = (16/2, 12/2) = (8,6). Correct. So midpoint is R. All checks out.\n\nTherefore, PQ length is 60/7. So m + n is 60 + 7 = 67. So answer is 67. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculation? Let me check once again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach the problem?\n\nAnother approach: Since R is the midpoint, then vector from P to R is half of vector PQ. So if I think in terms of vectors, maybe?\n\nBut maybe not necessary. Since my previous method worked, and all checks are correct, perhaps 67 is the right answer.\n\nBut let me think again. Let me compute PQ distance again.\n\nCoordinates of P: (32/7, 60/7)\n\nCoordinates of Q: (80/7, 24/7)\n\nDifference in x: 80/7 - 32/7 = 48/7\n\nDifference in y: 24/7 - 60/7 = -36/7\n\nSo distance squared is (48/7)^2 + (-36/7)^2 = (48^2 + 36^2)/7^2.\n\nCompute 48^2: 2304, 36^2: 1296, sum is 2304 + 1296 = 3600. sqrt(3600)/7 = 60/7. Correct. So yes, PQ is 60/7.\n\nTherefore, answer is 60 + 7 = 67. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let me parametrize the points.\n\nSuppose point P is on 8y = 15x. Let me write parametric coordinates for P. Let me let x = 8t, then y = (15/8)x = 15t. So P can be written as (8t, 15t). Similarly, for Q on 10y = 3x, let me parametrize. Let me let x = 10s, then y = (3/10)x = 3s. So Q is (10s, 3s). Then midpoint is ((8t + 10s)/2, (15t + 3s)/2) = (8, 6). Therefore:\n\n(8t + 10s)/2 = 8 => 8t + 10s = 16\n\n(15t + 3s)/2 = 6 => 15t + 3s = 12\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. 8t + 10s = 16\n\n2. 15t + 3s = 12\n\nLet me solve this system. Maybe simplify equations:\n\nEquation 1: divide by 2: 4t + 5s = 8\n\nEquation 2: divide by 3: 5t + s = 4\n\nSo:\n\nEquation 1: 4t + 5s = 8\n\nEquation 2: 5t + s = 4\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for s: s = 4 - 5t\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n4t + 5*(4 - 5t) = 8 => 4t + 20 - 25t = 8 => -21t + 20 = 8 => -21t = -12 => t = (-12)/(-21) = 4/7.\n\nSo t = 4/7. Then s = 4 - 5*(4/7) = 4 - 20/7 = 28/7 - 20/7 = 8/7.\n\nTherefore, t = 4/7, s = 8/7.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of P: (8t, 15t) = (8*(4/7), 15*(4/7)) = (32/7, 60/7). Same as before.\n\nCoordinates of Q: (10s, 3s) = (10*(8/7), 3*(8/7)) = (80/7, 24/7). Same as before. Therefore, same distance. So PQ length is 60/7. So answer is 67. So this method also gives same result. So seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 67.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{67}\n</think>"}
