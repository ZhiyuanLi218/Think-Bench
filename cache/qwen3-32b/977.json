The key concept here is the relationship between torque and angular acceleration. Torque is the rotational analog of force and is necessary to cause an object to rotate.\n\n---\n\n### Forces Acting on the Sphere\n\nThere are three primary forces acting on the sphere:\n\n1. **Gravity (mg)** – Acts vertically downward.\n2. **Normal force (N)** – Acts perpendicular to the surface of the incline.\n3. **Friction (f)** – Acts parallel to the surface of the incline.\n\nSince the sphere is rolling without slipping, the point of contact between the sphere and the incline is instantaneously at rest relative to the incline. This means **static friction** is the type of friction acting at the point of contact, not kinetic friction.\n\n---\n\n### Torque and Rotation\n\nTo produce rotation, a force must act at a distance from the axis of rotation. In the case of a sphere rolling down an incline, we typically consider the axis of rotation to be through the center of mass of the sphere.\n\n- **Gravity** acts through the center of mass. Therefore, its line of action passes through the axis of rotation, resulting in **zero torque** about that axis.\n- **Normal force** also acts through the center of the sphere, so it too produces **zero torque**.\n- **Static friction**, on the other hand, acts at the point of contact on the sphere's surface. Since this point is a distance (the radius of the sphere) from the center of rotation, static friction can produce a **non-zero torque**.\n\nThis torque is what causes the sphere to rotate as it moves down the incline. Without static friction, the sphere would simply slide without rotating.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly **static friction** provides the necessary torque to cause the sphere to rotate. Kinetic friction is not involved because there's no slipping, and gravity and the normal force do not produce torque about the center of mass.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{A}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which force causes a sphere to rotate as it rolls down a hill without slipping. The options are static friction, kinetic friction, the normal force, or gravity. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, when an object rolls without slipping, there's a condition that relates the linear acceleration to the angular acceleration. The key here is that the point of contact between the sphere and the hill is instantaneously at rest relative to the hill. That's why static friction comes into play instead of kinetic friction, right? Because if there's no slipping, the surfaces aren't moving past each other. So kinetic friction, which occurs during sliding, isn't the case here. So maybe static friction is involved.\n\nNow, torque is what causes rotation. Torque is the force times the lever arm (the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force). So, which force here can produce a torque on the sphere?\n\nLet's consider the forces acting on the sphere. There's gravity pulling it straight down. The normal force is perpendicular to the surface of the hill, pushing up on the sphere. Then there's friction, which acts parallel to the surface. Since the sphere is rolling down the hill, friction would be acting up the hill, opposing the sliding motion. But since it's rolling without slipping, it's static friction.\n\nNow, let's analyze each force's contribution to torque. If we take the axis of rotation through the center of the sphere, then gravity acts through the center of mass, which is also the center of the sphere. Therefore, gravity's line of action passes through the axis of rotation, so its lever arm is zero. That means gravity doesn't produce any torque about the center. Similarly, the normal force also acts through the center of the sphere, so it also has zero lever arm and no torque.\n\nBut static friction acts at the point of contact, which is on the surface of the sphere. If we take the axis through the center, the lever arm for static friction is the radius of the sphere. Since static friction is tangent to the sphere, the torque it produces is force times radius. So static friction provides the necessary torque to cause rotation.\n\nWait, but what if we take the torque about the point of contact instead? Then gravity would have a lever arm. But torque about different points can be different. However, the question is about the force that provides the torque causing rotation. In rolling without slipping, the rotation is about the center of mass, so considering torque about the center is more straightforward here.\n\nGravity can't provide torque about the center because its line of action goes through the center. Normal force is perpendicular, but also through the center. So only static friction, which is tangent to the surface and offset from the center, can provide a torque. So the answer should be static friction, option A.\n\nLet me just check if I'm missing something. If there were no friction, the sphere would just slide down the hill without rotating. But since it's rolling without slipping, there must be a torque. That torque comes from static friction. Kinetic friction is when there is sliding, which isn't the case here. So static friction is the correct answer. The normal force is perpendicular and doesn't contribute torque about the center. Gravity also doesn't contribute torque about the center. So yes, A is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
