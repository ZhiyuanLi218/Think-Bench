Let me start by recalling some formulas related to the area of a triangle and trigonometric identities.\n\nFirst, the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: (1/2)ab sin C, where a and b are two sides and C is the included angle. In this case, since we need tan A, maybe I should express the area in terms of sides b and c and angle A? Let me check.\n\nYes, if we take sides b and c with included angle A, the area would be (1/2)bc sin A. So according to the problem, this area is equal to a² - (b - c)². Let me write that down:\n\n(1/2)bc sin A = a² - (b - c)².\n\nNow, let me expand the right-hand side. Let's compute (b - c)² first. That would be b² - 2bc + c². Therefore, a² - (b - c)² is a² - b² + 2bc - c². Let me write that:\n\n(1/2)bc sin A = a² - b² - c² + 2bc.\n\nHmm, so simplifying the right-hand side:\n\n= (a² - b² - c²) + 2bc.\n\nWait, but in the Law of Cosines, we have a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A. Let me recall that formula. Yes, Law of Cosines says:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.\n\nTherefore, substituting this into the expression for the right-hand side:\n\na² - b² - c² + 2bc = (b² + c² - 2bc cos A) - b² - c² + 2bc.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nb² - b² cancels, c² - c² cancels. So we have:\n\n-2bc cos A + 2bc = 2bc(1 - cos A).\n\nTherefore, our equation becomes:\n\n(1/2)bc sin A = 2bc(1 - cos A).\n\nHmm, okay, so let me write that:\n\n(1/2)bc sin A = 2bc(1 - cos A).\n\nNow, assuming that bc ≠ 0 (which they aren't because they are sides of a triangle), we can divide both sides by bc:\n\n(1/2) sin A = 2(1 - cos A).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\nsin A = 4(1 - cos A).\n\nSo, sin A = 4 - 4 cos A.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving sin A and cos A. I need to find tan A, which is sin A / cos A. Maybe I can express this equation in terms of tan A or use some trigonometric identities to solve for A.\n\nLet me recall that sin² A + cos² A = 1. Maybe I can express sin A from the equation and substitute into this identity.\n\nFrom the equation sin A = 4(1 - cos A), let me write sin A as 4 - 4 cos A.\n\nLet me square both sides of this equation to use the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin² A = [4(1 - cos A)]² = 16(1 - 2 cos A + cos² A).\n\nBut we also know that sin² A = 1 - cos² A. Therefore:\n\n1 - cos² A = 16(1 - 2 cos A + cos² A).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n1 - cos² A = 16 - 32 cos A + 16 cos² A.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1 - cos² A - 16 + 32 cos A - 16 cos² A = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n( -cos² A - 16 cos² A ) + 32 cos A + (1 - 16) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-17 cos² A + 32 cos A - 15 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\n17 cos² A - 32 cos A + 15 = 0.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of cos A. Let me denote x = cos A for simplicity:\n\n17x² - 32x + 15 = 0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is x = [32 ± sqrt( (32)^2 - 4*17*15 )]/(2*17).\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = 1024 - 4*17*15.\n\nCalculate 4*17 = 68; 68*15. Let me compute 68*10 = 680, 68*5=340, so total is 680 + 340 = 1020. Therefore, D = 1024 - 1020 = 4. That's a nice number!\n\nTherefore, x = [32 ± sqrt(4)] / 34 = [32 ± 2]/34.\n\nSo two solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (32 + 2)/34 = 34/34 = 1.\n\nSecond solution: (32 - 2)/34 = 30/34 = 15/17.\n\nSo cos A is either 1 or 15/17. However, if cos A = 1, then angle A would be 0 degrees, which is impossible in a triangle. Therefore, we discard cos A = 1, and take cos A = 15/17.\n\nTherefore, cos A = 15/17. Then, sin A can be found from the earlier equation sin A = 4(1 - cos A). Let me compute that:\n\nsin A = 4*(1 - 15/17) = 4*(2/17) = 8/17.\n\nAlternatively, using sin² A + cos² A = 1:\n\nsin A = sqrt(1 - (15/17)^2) = sqrt(1 - 225/289) = sqrt(64/289) = 8/17. Since angle A is between 0 and 180 degrees in a triangle, sin A is positive. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17) / (15/17) = 8/15.\n\nTherefore, tan A is 8/15.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from area formula, substituted Law of Cosines correctly? Let me check:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nArea = (1/2)bc sin A = a² - (b - c)^2.\n\nThen expanding (b - c)^2 gives b² - 2bc + c², so a² - b² + 2bc - c². Then using Law of Cosines, a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A. Therefore substituting:\n\na² - b² - c² + 2bc becomes (b² + c² - 2bc cos A) - b² - c² + 2bc = -2bc cos A + 2bc = 2bc(1 - cos A). Then equation becomes (1/2) bc sin A = 2 bc (1 - cos A). Dividing by bc gives (1/2) sin A = 2(1 - cos A). Multiply by 2: sin A = 4(1 - cos A). Then squaring both sides gives sin² A = 16(1 - 2 cos A + cos² A). Then replacing sin² A with 1 - cos² A, leading to quadratic equation... which led to cos A = 15/17 and sin A = 8/17. Then tan A = 8/15. Seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem without going through the quadratic equation?\n\nLet me think. From sin A = 4(1 - cos A). Maybe use the identity tan(A/2) = (1 - cos A)/sin A. Wait, let me recall:\n\nWe have the identity:\n\ntan(A/2) = (1 - cos A)/sin A.\n\nSo if I rearrange sin A = 4(1 - cos A), then dividing both sides by sin A gives 1 = 4*(1 - cos A)/sin A = 4 tan(A/2). Therefore, tan(A/2) = 1/4.\n\nThen, using the double-angle formula for tan A:\n\ntan A = 2 tan(A/2) / (1 - tan²(A/2)) = 2*(1/4) / (1 - (1/4)^2) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/16) = (1/2) / (15/16) = (1/2)*(16/15) = 8/15. Same result. So that's another way to get tan A = 8/15. So that confirms the answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, tan A is 8/15. So I think that is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\tan A$ is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{15}}$.\n</think>"}
