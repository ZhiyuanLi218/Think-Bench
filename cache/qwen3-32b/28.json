The question is asking for the set of all s where the set τ(s) is nonempty, but all triangles in τ(s) are congruent. That set is supposed to be an interval [a, b), and I need to find a² + b². Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basics about triangles. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula (1/2)*base*height, but since we have two sides given, maybe it's better to use the formula involving sine of the included angle. The area s would be (1/2)*a*b*sinθ, where θ is the angle between sides of length a and b. In this case, the two sides are 4 and 10, so the area s = (1/2)*4*10*sinθ = 20*sinθ. Therefore, θ = arcsin(s/20). But θ has to be between 0 and π radians because it's an angle in a triangle.\n\nBut wait, the triangle is obtuse. So I need to consider when the triangle is obtuse. There are two cases for an obtuse triangle: either the angle opposite the longest side is obtuse, or one of the other angles is obtuse. Since we have sides of 4 and 10, the third side's length will determine which case we're in.\n\nLet me denote the sides of the triangle as follows: let’s say the triangle has sides of length 4, 10, and c. The angle between the sides of length 4 and 10 is θ, which we can relate to the area. Also, we need to ensure that the triangle is obtuse. So, first, let me figure out the conditions for the triangle to be obtuse.\n\nAn obtuse triangle has one angle greater than 90 degrees. Let's recall that for a triangle with sides a, b, c, where c is the longest side, the triangle is obtuse if a² + b² < c².\n\nSo, in our case, depending on the value of c, we can have different scenarios. Let me first find the range of possible c. By the triangle inequality, the third side c must satisfy |10 - 4| < c < 10 + 4, so 6 < c < 14.\n\nBut since the triangle is obtuse, we need to find for which values of c the triangle is obtuse. Let me consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The obtuse angle is between the sides of length 4 and 10, i.e., angle θ is obtuse. Then θ > 90°, so cosθ < 0. Also, by the law of cosines, c² = 4² + 10² - 2*4*10*cosθ. If θ is obtuse, then cosθ is negative, so c² = 16 + 100 - 2*4*10*cosθ. Since cosθ is negative, the term -2*4*10*cosθ becomes positive, making c² larger than 16 + 100 = 116. Therefore, c² > 116, so c > sqrt(116) ≈ 10.7703.\n\nCase 2: The obtuse angle is not between sides 4 and 10. That would mean that either the angle opposite the side of length 10 is obtuse or the angle opposite the side of length 4 is obtuse. However, since 10 is longer than 4, the angle opposite the side of length 10 is larger. Let me check when the angle opposite side 10 is obtuse. Let's denote the sides as a=4, b=10, c (unknown). The angle opposite side 10 is obtuse if 4² + c² < 10². So 16 + c² < 100 => c² < 84 => c < sqrt(84) ≈ 9.165.\n\nSimilarly, the angle opposite side 4 is obtuse if 10² + c² < 4² => 100 + c² < 16, which is impossible since c² is positive. Therefore, only two possibilities for obtuse triangles: either angle between 4 and 10 is obtuse (Case 1) with c > sqrt(116), or angle opposite the side 10 is obtuse (Case 2) with c < sqrt(84).\n\nTherefore, combining these, the triangle is obtuse if c < sqrt(84) or c > sqrt(116). But c must also satisfy the triangle inequality: 6 < c < 14. So the set of c for which the triangle is obtuse is (6, sqrt(84)) union (sqrt(116), 14). \n\nBut how does this relate to the area s? Since s is related to the angle θ between sides 4 and 10. Let me recall that s = 20*sinθ. Also, θ is between 0 and π. However, if θ is obtuse (Case 1), then θ is between π/2 and π. In that case, sinθ is positive but decreasing from 1 to 0 as θ goes from π/2 to π. So for Case 1, θ ∈ (π/2, π), so sinθ ∈ (0, 1). Therefore, s ∈ (0, 20). Wait, but when θ approaches π, sinθ approaches 0, so s approaches 0. When θ is π/2, sinθ is 1, so s is 20. But θ is obtuse, so θ is strictly greater than π/2, so sinθ is less than 1. Therefore, for Case 1, s ∈ (0, 20).\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, when θ is π/2, the triangle is right-angled, not obtuse. So for obtuse triangles with θ obtuse, θ is in (π/2, π), so sinθ is in (0, 1). Therefore, s is in (0, 20). However, if θ is acute, then sinθ is also positive. But in Case 2, the triangle is obtuse even though θ is acute. So how does Case 2 affect the area?\n\nIn Case 2, where the triangle is obtuse because the angle opposite side 10 is obtuse. In this case, θ is acute. Let me think. Let me try to relate the area here. The area is still (1/2)*4*10*sinθ = 20*sinθ. However, θ is acute here. But what is the range of θ in this case?\n\nSince the triangle is obtuse at the angle opposite side 10, which we found requires c < sqrt(84). Let me find the relationship between θ and c. Using the law of cosines:\n\nIn Case 2, the angle opposite side 10 is obtuse. Let me denote that angle as φ. Then, by law of cosines:\n\n10² = 4² + c² - 2*4*c*cosφ. But since φ is obtuse, cosφ is negative. Therefore:\n\n100 = 16 + c² - 2*4*c*cosφ => 100 - 16 - c² = -8c*cosφ => 84 - c² = -8c*cosφ => cosφ = (c² - 84)/(8c). Since φ is obtuse, cosφ < 0, so (c² - 84)/(8c) < 0. Since c > 0, this implies c² - 84 < 0 => c < sqrt(84), which matches our previous result.\n\nBut how does θ relate to c? Let me use the law of cosines again for angle θ (the angle between sides 4 and 10). For angle θ:\n\nc² = 4² + 10² - 2*4*10*cosθ => c² = 16 + 100 - 80*cosθ => c² = 116 - 80*cosθ.\n\nTherefore, cosθ = (116 - c²)/80.\n\nSince θ is acute in Case 2, cosθ > 0, so (116 - c²)/80 > 0 => 116 - c² > 0 => c² < 116 => c < sqrt(116). But in Case 2, we already have c < sqrt(84) ≈ 9.165, and sqrt(116) ≈ 10.77, so this is consistent. Therefore, θ is acute here.\n\nBut how does this affect the area? Since s = 20*sinθ, and θ is acute, sinθ is positive. But θ is related to c via cosθ = (116 - c²)/80. Therefore, sinθ can be found via sinθ = sqrt(1 - cos²θ). Wait, but maybe there's another way. Alternatively, since we have sides 4, 10, and c, maybe we can compute the area using Heron's formula? Let me check.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to relate s to c. Let me see. From c² = 116 - 80*cosθ, so cosθ = (116 - c²)/80. Therefore, sinθ = sqrt(1 - [(116 - c²)/80]^2). Therefore, s = 20*sqrt(1 - [(116 - c²)/80]^2). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express s in terms of c?\n\nAlternatively, since we have two sides and the included angle, maybe we can use another relation. Wait, but maybe we can use Heron's formula. Let me recall that Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter. But maybe that's more complicated here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two expressions for the area. One is s = 20*sinθ, and another is Heron's formula. But maybe we can find s in terms of c?\n\nAlternatively, since we know c² = 116 - 80*cosθ, so cosθ = (116 - c²)/80, then sinθ = sqrt(1 - [(116 - c²)/80]^2). Therefore, s = 20*sqrt(1 - [(116 - c²)/80]^2). But perhaps we can find s as a function of c?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find s in terms of c by using another formula? Let me think. For example, if we have sides 4, 10, c, then the area can also be calculated using Heron's formula. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote semi-perimeter as p = (4 + 10 + c)/2 = (14 + c)/2.\n\nThen, area squared is p(p - 4)(p - 10)(p - c). Therefore, s² = [(14 + c)/2]*[(14 + c)/2 - 4]*[(14 + c)/2 - 10]*[(14 + c)/2 - c].\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (14 + c)/2.\n\nSecond term: (14 + c)/2 - 4 = (14 + c - 8)/2 = (6 + c)/2.\n\nThird term: (14 + c)/2 - 10 = (14 + c - 20)/2 = (c - 6)/2.\n\nFourth term: (14 + c)/2 - c = (14 + c - 2c)/2 = (14 - c)/2.\n\nTherefore, s² = [(14 + c)/2] * [(6 + c)/2] * [(c - 6)/2] * [(14 - c)/2].\n\nMultiply them together:\n\ns² = [ (14 + c)(14 - c)(c + 6)(c - 6) ] / 16.\n\nNotice that (14 + c)(14 - c) = 196 - c², and (c + 6)(c - 6) = c² - 36. Therefore:\n\ns² = [ (196 - c²)(c² - 36) ] / 16.\n\nTherefore, s² = [ -c^4 + 36c² + 196c² - 196*36 ] / 16.\n\nWait, no, better to just leave it as (196 - c²)(c² - 36)/16.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write it as:\n\ns² = [ (196 - c²)(c² - 36) ] / 16.\n\nBut we can also relate this to our previous expression for s in terms of θ. From earlier, s = 20*sinθ, so s² = 400*sin²θ = 400*(1 - cos²θ) = 400 - 400*cos²θ.\n\nBut we also have cosθ = (116 - c²)/80. Therefore:\n\ns² = 400 - 400*[ (116 - c²)/80 ]² = 400 - 400*( (116 - c²)^2 ) / 6400 = 400 - ( (116 - c²)^2 ) / 16.\n\nTherefore, s² = [ 6400 - (116 - c²)^2 ] / 16.\n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions for s²:\n\nFrom Heron's formula: [ (196 - c²)(c² - 36) ] / 16 = [ 6400 - (116 - c²)^2 ] / 16.\n\nMultiply both sides by 16:\n\n(196 - c²)(c² - 36) = 6400 - (116 - c²)^2.\n\nLet me check if this equality holds. Let me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (196 - c²)(c² - 36) = 196c² - 196*36 - c^4 + 36c² = (196c² + 36c²) - c^4 - 6984 = 232c² - c^4 - 6984.\n\nRight side: 6400 - (116 - c²)^2. Let's expand (116 - c²)^2: 116² - 2*116*c² + c^4 = 13456 - 232c² + c^4. Therefore, right side is 6400 - 13456 + 232c² - c^4 = (-7056) + 232c² - c^4.\n\nComparing left and right sides:\n\nLeft: -c^4 + 232c² - 6984.\n\nRight: -c^4 + 232c² - 7056.\n\nWait, these are not equal. There is a discrepancy in the constants: -6984 vs -7056. That suggests I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, Heron's formula gave me:\n\ns² = [ (196 - c²)(c² - 36) ] / 16.\n\nBut from the other approach:\n\ns² = [6400 - (116 - c²)^2 ] / 16.\n\nLet me compute both expressions for a specific value of c to see which one is correct. Let me take c such that the triangle is right-angled. For example, suppose θ is 90 degrees, then c² = 4² + 10² = 16 + 100 = 116. Then c = sqrt(116). Let me compute s² from both expressions.\n\nFrom Heron's formula:\n\ns² = [ (196 - 116)(116 - 36) ] / 16 = (80)(80)/16 = 6400 / 16 = 400. Therefore s = 20, which is correct because when θ is 90 degrees, area is 20.\n\nFrom the other expression:\n\ns² = [6400 - (116 - 116)^2 ] / 16 = [6400 - 0]/16 = 400. So that's correct. Therefore, perhaps my expansion was wrong earlier.\n\nLet me re-express Heron's formula expression:\n\n(196 - c²)(c² - 36) = ?\n\nLet me compute 196 - c² multiplied by c² - 36.\n\nLet me denote x = c² for simplicity.\n\nThen, (196 - x)(x - 36) = -x² + 36x + 196x - 196*36 = -x² + 232x - 196*36.\n\nCompute 196*36: 200*36 - 4*36 = 7200 - 144 = 7056. Therefore, the left side is -x² + 232x - 7056.\n\nOn the right side, we had earlier:\n\n6400 - (116 - x)^2 = 6400 - (116² - 232x + x²) = 6400 - 116² + 232x - x².\n\nCompute 116²: 116*116. Let me compute 100² + 2*100*16 + 16² = 10000 + 3200 + 256 = 13456. Therefore:\n\nRight side is 6400 - 13456 + 232x - x² = -7056 + 232x - x², which is the same as left side: -x² + 232x - 7056. Therefore, my earlier expansion was correct. So why did I get different constants before? Because I miscalculated 196*36? Wait, no, I think I did it correctly. So both expressions are equal. Therefore, there is no discrepancy. So my mistake earlier was probably in miscalculating something else. Anyway, the important thing is that both expressions are equal, so that's good.\n\nTherefore, going back, we can use either expression for s². Since we need to find s in terms of c or vice versa, maybe we can proceed.\n\nBut perhaps I need to find the range of s for which there exists an obtuse triangle with sides 4, 10, and c, and area s. Also, the problem says τ(s) is nonempty but all triangles in τ(s) are congruent. So, τ(s) is the set of all obtuse triangles with area s and sides 4 and 10. For τ(s) to have all triangles congruent, there must be only one such triangle up to congruence. Which would mean that given sides 4 and 10, and area s, there is only one possible triangle (up to congruence) that satisfies these conditions and is obtuse. So, when does this happen?\n\nIn general, given two sides and the area, there can be two different triangles (one with an acute angle between the sides and one with an obtuse angle between the sides), unless the angle is uniquely determined. However, since we are restricting to obtuse triangles, maybe in some cases there is only one triangle possible?\n\nWait, but in our case, there are two cases for obtuse triangles: Case 1 where the angle between 4 and 10 is obtuse, and Case 2 where the angle opposite 10 is obtuse. So, for a given area s, there might be two different triangles (one in Case 1 and one in Case 2) which are not congruent. Therefore, τ(s) would contain non-congruent triangles unless only one case is possible for that s. Therefore, the set of s for which τ(s) is nonempty but all triangles in τ(s) are congruent is when s can be achieved only through one case (either Case 1 or Case 2), not both. Therefore, we need to find the values of s where only one of the cases is possible, so that τ(s) contains only triangles from that case, hence all congruent.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the values of s where only Case 1 or only Case 2 is possible. The overlap region where both Case 1 and Case 2 can produce triangles with area s would result in τ(s) containing non-congruent triangles, hence not satisfying the problem's condition. Therefore, the desired s values are those where s is in the range of Case 1 but not Case 2, or vice versa, but only when there is no overlap. Wait, but we need to find the interval [a, b) where for each s in [a, b), τ(s) is nonempty and all triangles in τ(s) are congruent. Therefore, we need to find the values of s where only one case is possible, i.e., the s values that are only achievable by Case 1 or only by Case 2. The overlap region would be s values achievable by both Case 1 and Case 2, which would make τ(s) have two different triangles (non-congruent), hence excluded. Therefore, the set of s where τ(s) is nonempty and all triangles in τ(s) are congruent is the union of the ranges of s from Case 1 minus the overlap and Case 2 minus the overlap. However, since the problem says it's an interval [a, b), I need to figure out how these ranges interact.\n\nFirst, let's find the range of s for Case 1 and Case 2.\n\nCase 1: Obtuse angle between sides 4 and 10. As we saw earlier, θ ∈ (π/2, π), so sinθ ∈ (0, 1), so s = 20*sinθ ∈ (0, 20). However, we need to check if there are restrictions based on c. Because c has to satisfy c > sqrt(116) ≈ 10.77. However, since c is determined by θ via c² = 116 - 80*cosθ. Since θ is in (π/2, π), cosθ ∈ (-1, 0). Therefore, -80*cosθ ∈ (0, 80). Therefore, c² = 116 - 80*cosθ ∈ (116 - 80*0, 116 - 80*(-1)) = (116, 116 + 80) = (116, 196). Therefore, c ∈ (sqrt(116), 14). Which is consistent with the triangle inequality. Therefore, in Case 1, s ∈ (0, 20). However, we need to check if for each s in (0, 20), there is a unique triangle. But since θ is uniquely determined by s (since s = 20*sinθ, θ ∈ (π/2, π)), then for each s in (0, 20), there is exactly one triangle in Case 1. Therefore, τ(s) would have only that triangle if there is no other triangle in Case 2 with the same area s.\n\nCase 2: Obtuse angle opposite side 10. In this case, c ∈ (6, sqrt(84)) ≈ (6, 9.165). Let me find the range of s for Case 2. Since θ is acute here, so θ ∈ (0, π/2), and s = 20*sinθ. However, θ is related to c. Let me find the relation between s and c in Case 2. From earlier, we have c² = 116 - 80*cosθ. Since θ is acute, cosθ is positive. Also, in Case 2, c < sqrt(84). Therefore, c² < 84. Therefore:\n\nc² = 116 - 80*cosθ < 84 => 116 - 84 < 80*cosθ => 32 < 80*cosθ => cosθ > 32/80 = 0.4 => θ < arccos(0.4). Therefore, θ ∈ (0, arccos(0.4)).\n\nTherefore, sinθ ∈ (0, sin(arccos(0.4))). Let me compute sin(arccos(0.4)). Let’s denote φ = arccos(0.4), then sinφ = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165. Therefore, s = 20*sinθ ∈ (0, 20*sqrt(0.84)) ≈ (0, 20*0.9165) ≈ (0, 18.33). Therefore, in Case 2, the area s ranges from 0 up to approximately 18.33.\n\nTherefore, the overlap between Case 1 and Case 2 for s is from 0 up to 18.33. Therefore, for s in (0, ~18.33), there are two different triangles (one in Case 1 and one in Case 2) with the same area s. Hence, τ(s) would contain two non-congruent triangles for these s, which we need to exclude. However, for s in (~18.33, 20), only Case 1 is possible, since Case 2 cannot reach that high s. Therefore, for those s, τ(s) contains only triangles from Case 1, hence all congruent. Additionally, we need to check if there's a lower bound for Case 2 where maybe only Case 2 is possible? Wait, for very small s, both Case 1 and Case 2 can have triangles. However, is there a minimum s for Case 2?\n\nIn Case 2, c ∈ (6, sqrt(84)). Let me find the minimum and maximum s for Case 2. When c approaches 6 from above, what happens to θ? Let me use c² = 116 - 80*cosθ. If c approaches 6, then c² approaches 36. Therefore:\n\n36 = 116 - 80*cosθ => 80*cosθ = 116 - 36 = 80 => cosθ = 1 => θ approaches 0. Therefore, sinθ approaches 0, so s approaches 0. On the other hand, when c approaches sqrt(84) from below, c² approaches 84. Therefore:\n\n84 = 116 - 80*cosθ => 80*cosθ = 116 - 84 = 32 => cosθ = 32/80 = 0.4, as before. Therefore, θ approaches arccos(0.4), and sinθ approaches sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84), so s approaches 20*sqrt(0.84). Therefore, in Case 2, s ∈ (0, 20*sqrt(0.84)).\n\nTherefore, for s in (0, 20*sqrt(0.84)), there are two triangles (Case 1 and Case 2) with area s. For s in [20*sqrt(0.84), 20), only Case 1 is possible. Therefore, the set of s where τ(s) is nonempty and all triangles in τ(s) are congruent is [20*sqrt(0.84), 20). However, the problem says this interval is [a, b). Therefore, a = 20*sqrt(0.84) and b = 20. However, we need to check if at s = 20*sqrt(0.84), τ(s) is nonempty and all triangles are congruent. Let me check.\n\nAt s = 20*sqrt(0.84), which is the upper bound of Case 2. At that s, there is a triangle in Case 2 (with c approaching sqrt(84) from below) and a triangle in Case 1? Wait, no. Wait, when s = 20*sqrt(0.84), is there a triangle in Case 1 with that s?\n\nFor Case 1, s ranges up to 20. So yes, s = 20*sqrt(0.84) is within (0, 20). But is there a Case 1 triangle with that s?\n\nLet me check. For Case 1, s = 20*sinθ. If s = 20*sqrt(0.84), then sinθ = sqrt(0.84). Therefore θ = arcsin(sqrt(0.84)). However, sqrt(0.84) is approx 0.9165, so arcsin(0.9165) is approx 66.5 degrees? Wait, no, arcsin(sqrt(0.84)) is arcsin(approx 0.9165). Wait, sin(60°) is approx 0.866, sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397. So sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165 is between 60° and 70°, so θ is acute. But Case 1 requires θ to be obtuse. Therefore, there is no θ in Case 1 (obtuse) with sinθ = sqrt(0.84). Therefore, at s = 20*sqrt(0.84), there is only one triangle (in Case 2) where θ is acute but the triangle is obtuse because angle opposite side 10 is obtuse. Wait, but earlier we said that in Case 2, θ is acute. However, when s = 20*sqrt(0.84), which is achieved when θ is arccos(0.4), which is acute. Therefore, there is only one triangle with that s? Wait, but if θ is acute, but the triangle is obtuse because the angle opposite 10 is obtuse. Therefore, τ(s) at s = 20*sqrt(0.84) contains only that triangle. However, is there another triangle in Case 1 with the same area? For Case 1, we need θ obtuse with sinθ = sqrt(0.84). However, sinθ = sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165. The obtuse angle θ would be π - arcsin(sqrt(0.84)). Let me check. Since sin(π - x) = sinx. Therefore, if there is an obtuse angle θ with sinθ = sqrt(0.84), it would be π - arcsin(sqrt(0.84)). Let me compute the value of θ in Case 1. Let me compute arcsin(sqrt(0.84)) ≈ arcsin(0.9165) ≈ 66.5 degrees (as above). Therefore, π - 66.5 degrees ≈ 113.5 degrees, which is obtuse. Therefore, there exists a θ in Case 1 with sinθ = sqrt(0.84). Therefore, at s = 20*sqrt(0.84), there are two triangles: one in Case 1 (obtuse angle between sides 4 and 10) and one in Case 2 (obtuse angle opposite side 10). Therefore, τ(s) would contain two non-congruent triangles at s = 20*sqrt(0.84). Therefore, the interval should start just above 20*sqrt(0.84). Therefore, the set of s where τ(s) is nonempty and all triangles in τ(s) are congruent is [a, b) where a is the minimal s where only Case 1 is possible, which is just above 20*sqrt(0.84), but since s is a real number, and the transition happens at s = 20*sqrt(0.84), but at that exact value there are two triangles. Therefore, the interval is [a, b) where a = 20*sqrt(0.84) and b = 20, but since at a there are two triangles, we need to exclude a. Wait, but the problem says \"the set of all s for which τ(s) is nonempty, but all triangles in τ(s) are congruent, is an interval [a,b)\". So if at s = a, τ(s) is nonempty but contains non-congruent triangles, then a must be greater than 20*sqrt(0.84). Therefore, there must be a minimal s where τ(s) is nonempty and contains only congruent triangles. Therefore, perhaps my previous reasoning was incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nWhen s = 20*sqrt(0.84), there are two triangles: one in Case 1 and one in Case 2. Therefore, τ(s) is nonempty but contains non-congruent triangles, so s = 20*sqrt(0.84) is excluded. Therefore, the interval should be (20*sqrt(0.84), 20). However, the problem says it's an interval [a, b). Therefore, maybe there's a different a?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a lower bound for Case 1 where τ(s) is nonempty and only Case 1 applies? Wait, for Case 1, s ∈ (0, 20). However, when s is in (0, 20*sqrt(0.84)), there are two triangles (Case 1 and Case 2). Therefore, the values of s where τ(s) has only Case 1 triangles are (20*sqrt(0.84), 20). However, the problem says the set is [a, b). Therefore, maybe there is a different consideration?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that for s in (0, 20*sqrt(0.84)), there are two triangles. Let me check for specific values. Let me take s = 10, which is in the overlap region. For s = 10, there should be two triangles: one with θ acute (Case 2) and one with θ obtuse (Case 1). Therefore, τ(10) contains two non-congruent triangles, so it's excluded. For s = 19, which is above 20*sqrt(0.84) (since 20*sqrt(0.84) ≈ 20*0.9165 ≈ 18.33), so 19 is above that. For s = 19, there is only Case 1 triangle, because Case 2 cannot reach that high s. Therefore, τ(19) contains only Case 1 triangles, hence all congruent. Therefore, the interval is [a, 20), where a is 20*sqrt(0.84). However, at s = a, τ(s) contains two triangles, so we need to exclude a. Therefore, the interval is (a, 20). But the problem says it's [a, b). Therefore, maybe my calculation of a is wrong?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another constraint where for some s, even though it's in the overlap region, τ(s) only contains congruent triangles? Wait, no. For s in the overlap region, there are two different triangles (acute θ and obtuse θ), hence non-congruent. Therefore, they should be excluded. Therefore, the correct interval is (a, 20), where a is 20*sqrt(0.84). However, the problem says the interval is [a, b). Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation of the overlap? Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me compute 20*sqrt(0.84). 0.84 is 84/100 = 21/25. Therefore sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5 ≈ 4.583/5 ≈ 0.916. Therefore, 20*sqrt(0.84) = 20*(sqrt(21)/5) = 4*sqrt(21). Wait, let me verify:\n\nsqrt(0.84) = sqrt(84/100) = sqrt(84)/10 = (2*sqrt(21))/10 = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, 20*sqrt(0.84) = 20*(sqrt(21)/5) = 4*sqrt(21). Therefore, a = 4*sqrt(21). Therefore, the interval is (4*sqrt(21), 20). But the problem says it's [a, b). Therefore, maybe at s = 4*sqrt(21), τ(s) is nonempty and all triangles are congruent? But earlier we saw that at s = 4*sqrt(21), there are two triangles. However, perhaps one of them is degenerate or something?\n\nWait, let me check when s = 4*sqrt(21). Let me compute the corresponding triangles.\n\nFirst, for Case 2: when s = 4*sqrt(21), which is achieved when θ is arccos(0.4). At that point, c approaches sqrt(84) from below. However, when c = sqrt(84), then the triangle becomes right-angled? Wait, no. When c = sqrt(84), then the angle opposite side 10 becomes right angle? Let me check. Earlier, we had for Case 2, the angle opposite side 10 is obtuse when c² < 84. When c² = 84, then 4² + c² = 16 + 84 = 100 = 10². Therefore, when c = sqrt(84), the triangle is right-angled with the right angle opposite side 10. Therefore, at c = sqrt(84), the triangle is right-angled, not obtuse. Therefore, when approaching c = sqrt(84) from below, the triangle is obtuse. Therefore, for s = 4*sqrt(21), which corresponds to c approaching sqrt(84) from below, there is a triangle in Case 2. However, there is also a triangle in Case 1 with the same area. Let me check that.\n\nFor Case 1, s = 20*sinθ = 4*sqrt(21). Therefore, sinθ = (4*sqrt(21))/20 = sqrt(21)/5 ≈ 0.916. Therefore, θ is arcsin(sqrt(21)/5) ≈ arcsin(0.916) ≈ 66.5 degrees. But Case 1 requires θ to be obtuse. However, since sinθ = sin(π - θ), there is an obtuse angle π - θ with the same sine. Therefore, there is an obtuse angle θ' = π - arcsin(sqrt(21)/5) which would give the same s. Therefore, there are two triangles with area s = 4*sqrt(21): one in Case 2 with acute θ and one in Case 1 with obtuse θ. Therefore, τ(s) contains two non-congruent triangles, so s = 4*sqrt(21) is excluded. Therefore, the interval should be (4*sqrt(21), 20). However, the problem states that the interval is [a, b). Therefore, there must be something wrong here. Maybe my initial assumption is incorrect?\n\nWait, let me check if when s = 4*sqrt(21), the triangle in Case 1 is valid. For Case 1, we need c > sqrt(116). Let me compute c for the Case 1 triangle with s = 4*sqrt(21). Since s = 20*sinθ, sinθ = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, θ is either arcsin(sqrt(21)/5) or π - arcsin(sqrt(21)/5). For Case 1, we take θ = π - arcsin(sqrt(21)/5). Then cosθ = -cos(arcsin(sqrt(21)/5)). Let me compute cos(arcsin(x)) = sqrt(1 - x²). Therefore, cos(arcsin(sqrt(21)/5)) = sqrt(1 - 21/25) = sqrt(4/25) = 2/5. Therefore, cosθ = -2/5. Therefore, c² = 116 - 80*cosθ = 116 - 80*(-2/5) = 116 + 32 = 148. Therefore, c = sqrt(148) ≈ 12.166, which is greater than sqrt(116) ≈ 10.77, so valid for Case 1. Therefore, there is a valid triangle in Case 1. Therefore, τ(4*sqrt(21)) has two triangles: one with c = sqrt(84) (but wait, no, in Case 2, c approaches sqrt(84) from below. Wait, when s = 4*sqrt(21), in Case 2, c² = 116 - 80*cosθ. For Case 2, θ is acute, with cosθ = 0.4 as we had earlier. Therefore, c² = 116 - 80*(0.4) = 116 - 32 = 84. Therefore, c = sqrt(84). But when c = sqrt(84), the triangle is right-angled, not obtuse. Therefore, actually, when s = 4*sqrt(21), the Case 2 triangle is right-angled, which is not obtuse. Therefore, τ(s) at s = 4*sqrt(21) only contains the Case 1 triangle? Wait, let me check.\n\nEarlier, I thought that for Case 2, when s approaches 4*sqrt(21), c approaches sqrt(84) from below, making the triangle obtuse. But when c = sqrt(84), the triangle is right-angled. Therefore, at s = 4*sqrt(21), the Case 2 triangle would be right-angled, which is excluded from τ(s) because τ(s) is the set of obtuse triangles. Therefore, τ(4*sqrt(21)) contains only the Case 1 triangle. Therefore, s = 4*sqrt(21) is included in the interval because τ(s) is nonempty (only Case 1 triangle) and all triangles in τ(s) are congruent. Therefore, my earlier reasoning was incorrect because I forgot that when c = sqrt(84), the triangle is right-angled, not obtuse, so it's excluded from τ(s). Therefore, for s = 4*sqrt(21), τ(s) contains only the Case 1 triangle, hence all congruent. Therefore, the interval is [4*sqrt(21), 20). Therefore, a = 4*sqrt(21) and b = 20. Therefore, the answer is a² + b² = (16*21) + 400 = 336 + 400 = 736.\n\nWait, let me verify this again. At s = 4*sqrt(21), in Case 2, c would be sqrt(84), but that gives a right triangle, which is not obtuse. Therefore, τ(s) does not include that triangle. The only triangle is in Case 1, which is obtuse. Therefore, τ(s) is nonempty and contains only one triangle (up to congruence). Therefore, s = 4*sqrt(21) is included. Therefore, the interval is [4*sqrt(21), 20). Therefore, a = 4*sqrt(21), b = 20. Therefore, a² + b² = (16*21) + 400 = 336 + 400 = 736. Therefore, the answer is 736.\n\nBut let me check another value just below 4*sqrt(21). Let me take s slightly less than 4*sqrt(21). Then, in Case 2, there is an obtuse triangle with c slightly less than sqrt(84), and in Case 1, there is an obtuse triangle with c slightly less than sqrt(148). Therefore, τ(s) would contain two triangles, hence excluded. Therefore, the minimal s is 4*sqrt(21). Therefore, the interval is [4*sqrt(21), 20). Therefore, the answer is 736.\n\nBut let me compute 4*sqrt(21). sqrt(21) is approx 4.583, so 4*4.583 ≈ 18.33, which matches our previous approximate value of 18.33. Therefore, this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is a² + b² = (4√21)² + 20² = 16*21 + 400 = 336 + 400 = 736.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{736}\n</think>"}
