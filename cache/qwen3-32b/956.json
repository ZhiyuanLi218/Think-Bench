I need to balance this chemical equation: CuFeS2 + O2 → Fe2O3 + CuSO4 + SO2. Hmm, balancing equations can be tricky sometimes, especially with multiple elements involved. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the elements on both sides to see where the imbalances are. On the left side, we have CuFeS2 and O2. On the right side, we have Fe2O3, CuSO4, and SO2. Let me count each element:\n\nLeft side:\n- Cu: 1 (from CuFeS2)\n- Fe: 1 (from CuFeS2)\n- S: 2 (from CuFeS2)\n- O: 2 (from O2)\n\nRight side:\n- Fe: 2 (from Fe2O3)\n- O: 3 (from Fe2O3) + 4 (from CuSO4) + 2 (from SO2) = 9 O\n- Cu: 1 (from CuSO4)\n- S: 1 (from CuSO4) + 1 (from SO2) = 2 S\n- Also, there's the O from O2 on the left, but that's separate.\n\nWait, so let's list them properly:\n\nLeft side:\nCu: 1\nFe: 1\nS: 2\nO: 2 (from O2) + any O from other compounds? Wait, the left side is only CuFeS2 and O2. So O is only from O2. The right side has O in Fe2O3, CuSO4, and SO2.\n\nSo the O on the right is 3 (Fe2O3) + 4 (CuSO4) + 2 (SO2) = 9 O per molecule. But since O2 is diatomic, maybe we need to adjust coefficients to get the right number of O atoms.\n\nLet me start by balancing the elements that appear in only one compound on each side first. Maybe Cu and Fe first.\n\nLooking at Cu: On the left, 1 Cu in CuFeS2. On the right, 1 Cu in CuSO4. So Cu is balanced if there's 1 Cu on each side. But if there are multiple CuFeS2 molecules, then Cu would increase. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider the Fe. On the left, 1 Fe per CuFeS2. On the right, 2 Fe in Fe2O3. So maybe I need 2 CuFeS2 molecules to get 2 Fe on the left. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set the coefficient of CuFeS2 as 2. So left side:\n\nCu: 2 (from 2 CuFeS2)\nFe: 2 (from 2 CuFeS2)\nS: 4 (since each CuFeS2 has 2 S, so 2*2=4)\nO: 2 (from O2)\n\nNow, right side:\n\nFe2O3 has 2 Fe, which matches the left side's 2 Fe. Good. Now Cu on the right is in CuSO4. If we have 2 CuFeS2 on the left, then we need 2 Cu on the right. But currently, Cu is only in CuSO4. So maybe we need 2 CuSO4 on the right? Let's check:\n\nIf right side has 2 CuSO4, then Cu is 2. That matches the left. Also, S in CuSO4 would be 2*1=2. But on the left, S is 4 (from 2 CuFeS2). So S on the right would be from CuSO4 and SO2. Let's see. If we have 2 CuSO4, that's 2 S. Then we need 4-2=2 S from SO2. Since each SO2 has 1 S, we need 2 SO2. So that gives 2 S. So total S on right would be 2 (from CuSO4) + 2 (from SO2) = 4, which matches left. Good.\n\nSo now, tentative coefficients:\n\nLeft: 2 CuFeS2 + O2\nRight: Fe2O3 + 2 CuSO4 + 2 SO2\n\nNow check O. Let's count O on both sides.\n\nLeft side: O is only from O2. Let's say there are x O2 molecules. So O on left is 2x.\n\nRight side: O in Fe2O3 is 3, in 2 CuSO4 is 2*4=8, in 2 SO2 is 2*2=4. Total O on right is 3 + 8 + 4 = 15.\n\nSo 2x = 15? That would mean x = 7.5. Hmm, fractional coefficients. That's okay, but we can multiply through to eliminate the fraction. Let me note that.\n\nSo O2 coefficient is 7.5. Let me write that as 15/2. But to eliminate fractions, maybe multiply all coefficients by 2. Let me check.\n\nIf I multiply all coefficients by 2, then:\n\nLeft: 4 CuFeS2 + 15 O2\nRight: 2 Fe2O3 + 4 CuSO4 + 4 SO2\n\nNow check O on both sides.\n\nLeft: 15*2 = 30 O.\n\nRight: 2 Fe2O3 has 2*3=6 O, 4 CuSO4 has 4*4=16 O, 4 SO2 has 4*2=8 O. Total O: 6 + 16 +8 = 30. Perfect, that's balanced.\n\nNow check other elements again with these coefficients.\n\nCu: Left: 4 (from 4 CuFeS2). Right: 4 (from 4 CuSO4). Good.\n\nFe: Left: 4 (from 4 CuFeS2). Right: 2 Fe2O3 has 2*2=4 Fe. Good.\n\nS: Left: 4*2=8 S. Right: 4 CuSO4 has 4 S, 4 SO2 has 4 S. Total 8 S. Good.\n\nO: As checked before, balanced.\n\nSo the balanced equation is:\n\n4 CuFeS2 + 15 O2 → 2 Fe2O3 + 4 CuSO4 + 4 SO2\n\nBut let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLeft side:\n\nCu: 4\nFe: 4\nS: 8\nO: 15*2=30\n\nRight side:\n\nFe2O3: 2 molecules, Fe=4, O=6\nCuSO4: 4 molecules, Cu=4, S=4, O=4*4=16\nSO2: 4 molecules, S=4, O=8\nTotal S: 4 +4=8\nTotal O: 6 +16 +8=30\nTotal Cu:4\nFe:4\nAll elements are balanced. Looks good.\n\nSo the balanced equation is 4 CuFeS2 + 15 O2 → 2 Fe2O3 + 4 CuSO4 + 4 SO2. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's a simpler way or if I missed something. Sometimes there are alternative ways, but this seems to work. The coefficients are all integers, and no fractions. So this should be the balanced equation.\n</think>"}
