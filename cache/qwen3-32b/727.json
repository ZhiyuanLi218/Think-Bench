The block is moving at a constant speed, so acceleration is zero. There's kinetic friction involved with a coefficient of sqrt(3)/3. Gravity is 10 m/s². Let me start by visualizing the problem.\n\nFirst, when a block is moving up an incline at constant speed, the forces along the incline must balance out. The tension in the string is pulling it up, and there are two forces opposing that motion: the component of gravity along the incline and the kinetic friction force.\n\nLet me recall the forces acting on the block. The gravitational force can be broken into two components: one parallel to the incline and one perpendicular. The parallel component is mg sin(theta), and the perpendicular component is mg cos(theta). Since the block is on an incline, the normal force isn't just mg, it's mg cos(theta) because the normal force counteracts the perpendicular component of gravity.\n\nFriction is then the coefficient of kinetic friction multiplied by the normal force. So friction force f_k = μ_k * N = μ_k * mg cos(theta).\n\nSince the block is moving up the incline, friction acts downward along the incline, opposing the motion. Therefore, the tension T must balance both the component of gravity and the friction.\n\nSo, T = mg sin(theta) + μ_k mg cos(theta). Since the block is moving at constant speed, net force is zero.\n\nTherefore, solving for mass m, we have:\n\nm = T / [g (sin(theta) + μ_k cos(theta))]\n\nGiven that T_max is 1500 N, so plugging in the values:\n\nFirst, let's compute the denominator:\n\ng = 10 m/s²\n\ntheta = 30 degrees, so sin(30°) = 1/2, cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nμ_k = sqrt(3)/3\n\nLet me compute sin(theta) + μ_k cos(theta):\n\nsin(30°) + (sqrt(3)/3) * cos(30°)\n\n= 1/2 + (sqrt(3)/3)*(sqrt(3)/2)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst term: 1/2.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/3)*(sqrt(3)/2) = ( (sqrt(3))^2 ) / (3*2) = (3)/6 = 1/2.\n\nSo total is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nWait, really? That simplifies nicely! So the denominator becomes g*(1) = 10 m/s² * 1 = 10 m/s².\n\nTherefore, m = T / 10.\n\nSince T_max is 1500 N, then m_max = 1500 / 10 = 150 kg.\n\nWait, so the maximum mass is 150 kg? That's option A. But let me check again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me recheck the calculation for sin(theta) + μ_k cos(theta):\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5.\n\ncos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.\n\nμ_k is sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.5774.\n\nSo μ_k * cos(theta) ≈ 0.5774 * 0.8660 ≈ Let me compute that:\n\nsqrt(3)/3 * sqrt(3)/2 = (3)/6 = 0.5. Exactly. So yes, 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. So the denominator is indeed g*1. Therefore m = T/g = 1500 / 10 = 150 kg. So option A.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\n(A) 150 kg\n\n(B) 100√3 kg ≈ 173.2 kg\n\n(C) 200 kg\n\n(D) 200√3 kg ≈ 346.4 kg\n\nSo according to my calculation, answer is A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the direction of friction or something else.\n\nThe tension is pulling the block up, so the friction is opposing the motion, which is down the incline. Therefore, the total force required to pull it up is mg sin(theta) + friction. Which is what I used. So that's correct.\n\nFriction is μ_k*N. N is mg cos(theta). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So maximum mass is 150 kg. So answer is A. But let me check if there is a mistake in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that when the tension is maximum, the mass is maximum. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of the coefficient?\n\nWait, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/3. sqrt(3) is approx 1.732, divided by 3 is approx 0.577, which is 1/sqrt(3). Yes, because sqrt(3)/3 is 1/sqrt(3). Rationalizing the denominator, 1/sqrt(3) is sqrt(3)/3. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. Then why is there an option B? Let me check if perhaps I should have subtracted the friction?\n\nWait, no. If the block is moving up, then both gravity component and friction are acting downward, so tension has to overcome both. Therefore, T = mg sin(theta) + f_k. So addition. If the block were moving down, then friction would be up the plane, and depending on whether it's accelerating or not. But in this case, it's moving up, so yes, both forces oppose the motion, so tension must counteract both. So the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the angle? Theta is 30 degrees. Let me check sin(30) and cos(30). Yes, sin(30) is 0.5, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So answer is A. 150 kg.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me compute all terms numerically.\n\nCompute denominator:\n\nsin(30°) + μ_k cos(30°) = 0.5 + (sqrt(3)/3)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 + ( (3)/ (3*2) ) = 0.5 + (1/2) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. Correct. So denominator is 1, so m = T / g = 1500 / 10 = 150 kg. So answer A.\n\nBut let me check if there is a misunderstanding in the problem. The question says \"the maximum tension that the light string can withstand is 1500 N\". So if the tension required to pull the block is T, then T cannot exceed 1500 N. Therefore, for maximum mass, T is 1500 N. Which is what I used. Therefore, correct.\n\nSo answer is A. But why is option B there? Let me check if perhaps I should have used static friction? But no, the problem says coefficient of kinetic friction, and the block is moving at constant speed. So kinetic friction is the right one. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign? Suppose I had written T = mg sin(theta) - friction? But that would be if the block were moving down. But here it's moving up. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the maximum mass before the string breaks. So if you have a heavier mass, the required tension would be higher, so the maximum mass is when tension is maximum. Therefore, yes, m_max = T_max / [g(...)].\n\nTherefore, answer is A. So the correct answer is option A, 150 kg. Therefore, I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
