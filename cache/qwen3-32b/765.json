The nucleus X is specified as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what kind of nucleus we're dealing with. Lithium (Li) typically has different isotopes. The standard lithium has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. So, let's calculate the mass number A. The mass number is the number of protons plus neutrons. So for lithium with 3 neutrons, since it has 3 protons (as lithium's atomic number is 3), the mass number A is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\nNow, I need to find the energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. The question mentions that the precision of the energy is at 1e-4, so the answer needs to be very precise. The options are given as A:21.419, B:18.475, C:20.132, D:23.069 GeV. The answer is likely one of these, so I need to calculate the correct one.\n\nSince the nucleus is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects must be considered. The energy in relativity is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = γ * m * c²\n\nWhere:\n- E is the total energy\n- γ is the Lorentz factor\n- m is the rest mass of the particle\n- c is the speed of light\n\nFirst, I need to find the Lorentz factor γ. The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven that v = 0.96c, substituting into the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) ≈ 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\nWait, let me calculate that more precisely. Let's compute 0.96 squared:\n\n0.96² = 0.9216\n\nSo 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784\n\nsqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute that. Since 0.28² = 0.0784 (because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784), so sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Therefore, γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857...\n\nSo γ ≈ 3.5714.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the rest mass of the nucleus. The rest mass of the nucleus is needed to calculate the total energy. The rest mass of the nucleus can be approximated by the sum of the rest masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy. However, since this is a particle physics problem and we're dealing with high-energy collisions, perhaps the exact rest mass is not necessary to look up in detail, but maybe we can use known values or approximate values for the mass of the nucleus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the mass number A (which is 6) and multiplying by the mass of a nucleon. However, the actual rest mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons due to the binding energy (mass defect). But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can approximate the rest mass of the nucleus as the mass number multiplied by the mass of a proton. But wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and the mass of a neutron is about 940 MeV/c². However, since the nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, maybe we can compute the exact rest mass?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the atomic mass unit (u) and converting that to energy. Let me think.\n\nBut first, let me check what the standard approach is for calculating the kinetic energy of a heavy ion in a collider. In collider experiments, the energy per nucleon is often considered. But the problem is asking for the energy of the nucleus X, which would be the total energy of the entire nucleus. However, the options given are in GeV. So, the answer is likely the total energy of the nucleus.\n\nFirst, let's find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Let me recall that the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and the mass of a neutron is approximately 940 MeV/c². Let me check exact values:\n\nProton mass: 938.272 MeV/c²\n\nNeutron mass: 939.565 MeV/c²\n\nSo, for ³Li with 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\n\nTotal rest mass = 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron mass) - binding energy.\n\nBut binding energy would be a small correction. However, since the problem is about high-energy collisions, perhaps the binding energy is negligible compared to the kinetic energy? Or maybe the problem is using the atomic mass instead of the nuclear mass. Alternatively, maybe we can use the mass of the atom and subtract the electrons. Wait, but the nucleus is being accelerated, so electrons are not involved. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can use the mass of the lithium atom and then subtract the electrons? Let me think.\n\nThe mass of the lithium-6 atom is known. Let me look up the atomic mass of Li-6. However, since I don't have access to external resources, I need to recall or approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the mass of the nucleus by considering the mass of the atom and subtracting the electrons.\n\nThe atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122 atomic mass units (u). Let me confirm this value. If I recall, the atomic mass of Li-6 is around 6.015 u. The exact value is not something I can look up, but for the sake of this problem, maybe I can use this value. Then, to get the nuclear mass, we subtract the mass of the electrons. Lithium has 3 electrons. The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u. So, the nuclear mass would be:\n\nNuclear mass = atomic mass - 3*(electron mass) ≈ 6.015122 u - 3*0.00054858 u ≈ 6.015122 - 0.0016457 ≈ 6.013476 u.\n\nBut even this is an approximation. However, the problem is likely expecting me to use a standard value for the mass of the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass number A as the number of nucleons, and assuming that each nucleon has a mass of about 939 MeV/c². Let me check.\n\nIf I take the mass of a nucleon as approximately 939 MeV/c², then for a nucleus with A=6, the rest mass energy would be 6 * 939 MeV = 5634 MeV = 5.634 GeV. However, this is just an approximation. The actual mass of the nucleus would be less due to the binding energy. For example, the binding energy of Li-6 is about 32 MeV per nucleon? Wait, no, let me think. The binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to separate all the nucleons. For Li-6, the binding energy is about 31.994 MeV (total). Let me check with the semi-empirical mass formula, but again, without exact data, perhaps this is too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the rest mass of the nucleus is approximately equal to the mass number times the proton mass? For example, using A=6 and m_p = 938 MeV/c², so 6*938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV. But this is again an approximation. However, given that the problem is about relativistic energy and the speed is given, perhaps the exact rest mass is not critical, and the problem expects using a standard value or perhaps a specific value that they have in mind.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy of the nucleus in the collider, not the total energy. Wait, the question says \"the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c\". Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Is it asking for the kinetic energy of the nucleus? Or the total energy? In collider contexts, the energy is often quoted as the beam energy, which is typically the kinetic energy per nucleon. But the problem says \"the energy of the RHIC\", which is a collider, but the energy of the collider is usually the total energy in the collision, but here it's phrased as \"the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c\". So perhaps they are asking for the kinetic energy of the nucleus? Or the total energy?\n\nThe question is a bit ambiguous, but given that the answer options are in the range of 18-23 GeV, which is plausible for the total energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Let me think.\n\nLet me proceed with the total energy calculation, assuming that the rest mass of the nucleus is approximately 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV. Then, with γ ≈ 3.5714, the total energy would be γ * rest mass energy = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV ≈ let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 3.5714 * 5.628. Let me compute 3.5 * 5.628 = 19.698, and 0.0714 * 5.628 ≈ 0.401. So total ≈ 19.698 + 0.401 ≈ 20.099 GeV. The closest option is C:20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's close. But this is based on approximating the rest mass as 5.628 GeV. However, if the actual rest mass is a bit higher, due to the neutron being slightly heavier than the proton, then the total energy would be higher.\n\nLet me recalculate with more accurate nucleon masses. The rest mass of the nucleus is 3 protons + 3 neutrons minus binding energy. Let's compute the total rest mass energy of the nucleons (ignoring binding energy for now):\n\nProton mass: 938.272 MeV/c² each\nNeutron mass: 939.565 MeV/c² each\n\nTotal rest mass energy = 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV ≈ 5.6335 GeV\n\nSo, with γ ≈ 3.5714, the total energy would be 3.5714 * 5.6335 ≈ let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 3 * 5.6335 = 16.9005\n\n0.5714 * 5.6335 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 0.5 * 5.6335 = 2.81675\n\n0.0714 * 5.6335 ≈ 0.4015\n\nSo total ≈ 2.81675 + 0.4015 ≈ 3.21825\n\nSo total energy ≈ 16.9005 + 3.21825 ≈ 20.11875 GeV ≈ 20.119 GeV\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. The difference might be due to the binding energy. If we subtract the binding energy from the rest mass, then the total energy would be slightly less. However, if the problem assumes that the binding energy is negligible (which is common in high-energy physics where the kinetic energy is much larger than the binding energy), then our calculation gives approximately 20.119 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV. Considering the precision required (1e-4), the answer is likely option C.\n\nBut let me check the exact value of γ. Earlier, I approximated γ as 3.5714, but let me compute it more precisely.\n\nGiven v = 0.96c, so v/c = 0.96.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...\n\nSo exactly 3.57142857...\n\nNow, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 5.6335 GeV as above. Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.6335.\n\nLet me compute this multiplication precisely.\n\nFirst, write 3.57142857 as 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857. Let me check:\n\n25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857... Yes, because 7*3=21, 7*0.5714≈4, so 3.5714*7=25.\n\nSo, if I use γ = 25/7, then:\n\nTotal energy E = (25/7) * 5.6335 GeV\n\nLet me compute 5.6335 * 25 / 7.\n\nFirst compute 5.6335 * 25:\n\n5 * 25 = 125\n\n0.6335 * 25 = 15.8375\n\nTotal: 125 + 15.8375 = 140.8375 GeV\n\nThen divide by 7: 140.8375 / 7 ≈ 20.1196 GeV\n\nSo approximately 20.1196 GeV. The given option is C:20.132 GeV. The difference is about 0.0124 GeV, which is about 0.06% difference. This could be due to the binding energy not being neglected. Let me check what the actual binding energy of Li-6 is.\n\nThe binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to split it into individual nucleons. The binding energy per nucleon for Li-6 is roughly around 5 MeV per nucleon. So total binding energy would be 6 * 5 MeV = 30 MeV = 0.03 GeV. Therefore, the actual rest mass energy of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons by 0.03 GeV. Therefore, the rest mass energy is 5.6335 GeV - 0.03 GeV = 5.6035 GeV.\n\nRecalculating the total energy with this adjusted rest mass:\n\nE = γ * (5.6035 GeV) = 25/7 * 5.6035 ≈ Let's compute 5.6035 * 25 = 140.0875, then divided by 7 ≈ 20.0125 GeV. Hmm, this is now lower, about 20.01 GeV. But this is still not matching any of the options. However, the binding energy per nucleon for Li-6 is actually higher. Let me recall that the binding energy for light nuclei like Li is actually higher. For example, the binding energy of Li-6 is about 32 MeV (total), according to some sources I remember. Let me check that.\n\nIf the total binding energy is 32 MeV, then the rest mass energy of the nucleus is the sum of the individual nucleons minus the binding energy. The sum of the individual nucleons was 5.6335 GeV, so subtracting 0.032 GeV gives 5.6335 - 0.032 = 5.6015 GeV. Then total energy is 5.6015 * 25/7 ≈ 5.6015 * 3.5714 ≈ ?\n\nAgain, 5.6015 * 25 = 140.0375 GeV, divided by 7 ≈ 20.005 GeV. Still around 20.0 GeV. The closest option is C:20.132 GeV. The discrepancy suggests that perhaps the binding energy is not being considered, or perhaps there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy rather than the total energy. Let's explore that possibility.\n\nThe total energy E is γ * m * c², and the kinetic energy K is E - mc² = (γ - 1) m c².\n\nIf the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then:\n\nK = (γ - 1) * m * c²\n\nWith γ ≈ 3.5714, then γ - 1 = 2.5714\n\nSo K ≈ 2.5714 * 5.6335 GeV ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 2 * 5.6335 = 11.267\n\n0.5714 * 5.6335 ≈ 3.218 (as before)\n\nTotal ≈ 11.267 + 3.218 ≈ 14.485 GeV. None of the options match this. The options are in the 18-23 GeV range. So if it's total energy, our previous calculation gives around 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C. If the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, then perhaps there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons? Let me check.\n\nIf the kinetic energy per nucleon is K/A, then total kinetic energy would be K = (γ - 1) * A * m_nucleon * c². But that's the same as before. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the rest mass.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the rest mass calculation. Let me try using the atomic mass of Li-6 and converting that to energy.\n\nThe atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122 u. The conversion factor from atomic mass units to MeV/c² is approximately 931.5 MeV/u. So the atomic mass energy is 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV\n\n0.015122 * 931.5 ≈ Let's compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315 MeV, 0.005122 * 931.5 ≈ approx 4.76 MeV. Total ≈ 9.315 + 4.76 ≈ 14.075 MeV\n\nTotal atomic mass energy ≈ 5589 + 14.075 ≈ 5603.075 MeV ≈ 5.603 GeV\n\nThis is the atomic mass energy. But to get the nuclear mass energy, we need to subtract the electrons. The lithium atom has 3 electrons. The mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV/c². So 3 electrons contribute 1.533 MeV. Therefore, the nuclear mass energy is 5.603 GeV - 0.001533 GeV ≈ 5.6015 GeV. Which is the same as before when considering binding energy. So this gives us the same rest mass energy of ~5.6015 GeV.\n\nThen total energy E = γ * m_nuclear * c² ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV ≈ let's compute this.\n\n3.5714 * 5.6015 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 3.5 * 5.6015 = 19.60525\n\n0.0714 * 5.6015 ≈ 0.4001\n\nTotal ≈ 19.60525 + 0.4001 ≈ 20.0053 GeV ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nStill around 20.005 GeV. The closest option is C:20.132 GeV. The difference is about 0.127 GeV. This suggests that perhaps there is an error in my calculation or assumptions.\n\nLet me check the value of γ again. Is it correct?\n\nv = 0.96c\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem is using the mass of the entire atom instead of the nucleus. Let's try that. If we use the atomic mass energy of 5.603 GeV, then total energy would be γ * 5.603 GeV ≈ 3.5714 * 5.603 ≈ ?\n\nAgain, 3.5714 * 5.603 ≈ same as before ≈ 20.005 GeV. Still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different value for the rest mass of the nucleus. For example, if the rest mass is taken as 5.63 GeV instead of 5.60 GeV, then:\n\nE = 3.5714 * 5.63 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 3.5714 * 5.63:\n\nFirst, 3.5 * 5.63 = 19.705\n\n0.0714 * 5.63 ≈ 0.401\n\nTotal ≈ 19.705 + 0.401 ≈ 20.106 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV. The difference is 20.106 vs 20.132, which is about 0.026 GeV. This could be due to more precise values for the rest mass.\n\nLet me check with more precise numbers for the rest mass. Let's go back to the atomic mass of Li-6. Let's assume the exact atomic mass is 6.015122 u (from memory or standard tables). Converting this to MeV/c²:\n\n1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² (approximate value)\n\nSo 6.015122 u * 931.494 MeV/u ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFirst, 6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV\n\n0.015122 * 931.494 ≈ Let's calculate:\n\n0.01 * 931.494 = 9.31494 MeV\n\n0.005 * 931.494 = 4.65747 MeV\n\n0.000122 * 931.494 ≈ 0.1136 MeV\n\nAdding these: 9.31494 + 4.65747 = 13.97241 + 0.1136 ≈ 14.086 MeV\n\nTotal atomic mass energy ≈ 5588.964 + 14.086 ≈ 5603.05 MeV ≈ 5.60305 GeV\n\nSubtracting the electrons (3 * 0.511 MeV = 1.533 MeV):\n\nNuclear mass energy ≈ 5.60305 GeV - 0.001533 GeV ≈ 5.601517 GeV\n\nSo, using this precise value, total energy is γ * 5.601517 GeV ≈ 3.57142857 * 5.601517 ≈ let's calculate this with more precision.\n\nLet me use the exact fraction for γ, which is 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857...\n\nSo:\n\nE = (25/7) * 5.601517 GeV\n\nFirst compute 5.601517 * 25:\n\n5 * 25 = 125\n\n0.601517 * 25 = 15.037925\n\nTotal = 125 + 15.037925 = 140.037925 GeV\n\nNow divide by 7:\n\n140.037925 / 7 ≈ 20.00541786 GeV ≈ 20.0054 GeV\n\nThis is still about 20.005 GeV, which is very close to 20.005 GeV, while option C is 20.132 GeV. There's a discrepancy of about 0.127 GeV. What could account for this?\n\nPerhaps the problem is using a different value for the rest mass. Let me check if the mass of Li-6 is different. For example, maybe the problem is using the mass of the nucleus without subtracting the electrons? If we use the atomic mass energy of 5.60305 GeV and don't subtract the electrons, then:\n\nE = 3.5714 * 5.60305 ≈ same as before, 20.005 GeV. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy? Let's recalculate kinetic energy with the precise rest mass.\n\nKinetic energy K = (γ - 1) * m * c² = (25/7 - 1) * 5.601517 GeV = (18/7) * 5.601517 ≈ 2.57142857 * 5.601517 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 2.5 * 5.601517 = 14.0037925\n\n0.07142857 * 5.601517 ≈ 0.4001 GeV (as before)\n\nTotal ≈ 14.0038 + 0.4001 ≈ 14.4039 GeV. Still not matching the options.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem is using a different speed. Wait, the problem states that the speed is 0.96c. Let me confirm that the calculation for γ is correct.\n\nv = 0.96c\n\nβ = v/c = 0.96\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... Correct.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons? For example, if the collider provides kinetic energy per nucleon, then total kinetic energy would be A * K_per_nucleon. But unless specified, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the relativistic kinetic energy formula with a different rest mass. Let me think about the mass of the nucleus again. Perhaps there is a mistake in my calculation of the nuclear mass.\n\nLet me try to recalculate the nuclear mass using the semi-empirical mass formula or another approach. However, without precise data, this is challenging. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass of Li-6 in MeV/c².\n\nWait, I remember that the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is 939.565 MeV/c², and electron is 0.511 MeV/c². Let me recalculate the nuclear mass more accurately.\n\nThe nuclear mass is the mass of the atom minus the electrons. The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u. Let's convert this to MeV/c².\n\nFirst, 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c².\n\nSo atomic mass energy = 6.015122 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?\n\nLet me calculate this precisely:\n\n6.015122 * 931.494\n\nBreak it down:\n\n6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV\n\n0.015122 * 931.494 = ?\n\nCalculate 0.01 * 931.494 = 9.31494 MeV\n\n0.005 * 931.494 = 4.65747 MeV\n\n0.000122 * 931.494 ≈ 0.1136 MeV\n\nAdding these: 9.31494 + 4.65747 = 13.97241 + 0.1136 ≈ 14.086 MeV\n\nTotal atomic mass energy ≈ 5588.964 + 14.086 = 5603.05 MeV ≈ 5.60305 GeV\n\nNow, the nuclear mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons. Lithium-6 has 3 electrons in the atom. The mass of these electrons is 3 * 0.511 MeV = 1.533 MeV.\n\nSo nuclear mass energy = 5.60305 GeV - 0.001533 GeV = 5.601517 GeV\n\nThis is what I had before. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem is using the kinetic energy in the lab frame, but considering the collider's center-of-mass energy? No, the question is about the energy of the nucleus X, not the collision.\n\nWait, the question says \"the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c\". This is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the beam energy (the energy of each nucleus)? In that case, it would be the kinetic energy or the total energy of the nucleus. In collider experiments, the beam energy is often quoted as the kinetic energy per nucleon. However, for heavy ions, sometimes the energy is given per nucleon or total.\n\nLet me check what the typical beam energy for RHIC is. For example, RHIC can accelerate gold ions (A=197) to energies up to about 100 GeV per nucleon. For lighter ions like lithium, the energy would be higher per nucleon if the total energy is comparable. However, the options here are in the range of ~18-23 GeV total for a Li-6 nucleus. Let's see.\n\nIf the total energy of the nucleus is 20.132 GeV, then the energy per nucleon is 20.132 / 6 ≈ 3.355 GeV/nucleon. This is plausible for RHIC, which typically operates at lower energies than the LHC but still in the GeV range per nucleon.\n\nGiven that my calculation gives approximately 20.005 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV, the difference might be due to rounding or more precise values of the rest mass. Perhaps the problem uses a slightly different value for the rest mass of the nucleus.\n\nLet me consider that maybe the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as 5.63 GeV (as in the sum of protons and neutrons without subtracting binding energy). Let's recalculate with that.\n\nE = γ * m = 3.5714 * 5.63 GeV ≈ 20.119 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV. The difference is about 0.013 GeV, which could be due to rounding in the problem's options. Given that the options are precise to four decimal places, but my calculation is approximate, it's possible that with more precise values, the answer aligns with option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as 5.6335 GeV (sum of protons and neutrons) and doesn't subtract binding energy, leading to E = 3.5714 * 5.6335 ≈ 20.119 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV, and option C is 20.132 GeV. Given the precision required (1e-4), this is very close, and likely the correct answer is C.\n\nAnother possibility is that I made a mistake in the calculation of the Lorentz factor. Let me verify:\n\nv = 0.96c\n\nβ = 0.96\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother check: if the speed were 0.99c, what would γ be? Let's say for verification. For β=0.99, γ ≈ 7.0888, which is a known value. So my calculation for β=0.96 is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV, as my calculation gives approximately 20.119 GeV, which is very close considering possible rounding and the precision of the problem's options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
