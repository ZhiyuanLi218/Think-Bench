Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nWe have two metals, X and Y, both in the short-period of the periodic table. They react with excess dilute hydrochloric acid (for X) and dilute sulfuric acid (for Y), producing hydrogen gas. The amounts of hydrogen gas produced are V1 L and V2 L respectively for 0.1 mol of each metal. The question is about which statement among the options A to D is incorrect.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when metals react with acids, they typically produce hydrogen gas and a salt. The general reaction for a metal M reacting with an acid HA would be something like:\n\nM + nHA → MA_n + (n/2) H2↑\n\nBut the exact stoichiometry depends on the oxidation state of the metal. For example, if the metal has a +1 oxidation state, it might react with one H+ ion to produce hydrogen. If it's +2, it might need two H+ ions.\n\nSince both X and Y are metals in short periods, they're likely to be in groups 1 or 2. Let me think. Short-period metals would be the first three periods. So group 1 metals (like Li, Na, K) have +1 oxidation state, group 2 (Be, Mg, Ca) have +2. There's also aluminum in group 13, which has a +3 oxidation state, but it's a metal. However, since the problem says \"short-period,\" maybe they're considering only up to period 3? So Al is in period 3. But the problem says \"both short-period metal elements,\" so maybe they could be group 1, 2, or 13.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nThe key here is to relate the amount of hydrogen gas produced to the oxidation state of the metal.\n\nLet me think about the general reaction. Suppose a metal M with oxidation state +n reacts with an acid. The reaction would be:\n\nM + n H+ → M^n+ + (n/2) H2\n\nBecause each H+ gains one electron to become H2. The metal is oxidized. For example, if the metal loses n electrons (oxidation state +n), then each H+ gains one electron. So, for every n H+ ions, you get n/2 H2 molecules.\n\nTherefore, the moles of H2 produced would be (n/2) * moles of metal.\n\nWait, let me verify that with an example. Let's take sodium (Na) which is +1. The reaction with HCl would be:\n\n2 Na + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2↑\n\nSo 2 moles of Na produce 1 mole of H2. So per mole of Na, it's 0.5 moles of H2. Which is n/2 where n is +1. So 1/2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Mg (oxidation state +2). Reaction with HCl:\n\nMg + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + H2↑\n\nSo 1 mole of Mg produces 1 mole of H2. Which is n/2 = 2/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Al (oxidation state +3). Reaction with HCl:\n\n2 Al + 6 HCl → 2 AlCl3 + 3 H2↑\n\nSo 2 moles Al produce 3 moles H2. So per mole of Al, 1.5 moles H2. Which is n/2 = 3/2 = 1.5. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nmoles of H2 = (oxidation state of metal / 2) * moles of metal.\n\nSo if we have 0.1 mol of metal X with oxidation state n, then moles of H2 is (n/2)*0.1. Similarly for Y with oxidation state m, moles of H2 is (m/2)*0.1.\n\nSince volume of gas at same temperature and pressure is proportional to moles, V1/V2 would be [(n/2)*0.1]/[(m/2)*0.1] = n/m. Therefore, V1/V2 = n/m. So the ratio of volumes is equal to the ratio of oxidation states. So statement D says that V1/V2 can necessarily determine the oxidation states. Well, if we know V1/V2, then we know the ratio of oxidation states. However, can we necessarily determine the actual oxidation states? For example, if V1/V2 is 2/3, then n/m = 2/3, but n and m could be 2 and 3, or 4 and 6, etc. But since they are metals in short periods, their oxidation states are limited. For example, group 1 metals are +1, group 2 are +2, Al is +3. So maybe in that case, if the ratio is 1:1, they both have same oxidation state. If ratio is 1:2, maybe X is +1 and Y is +2. So maybe D is correct? The problem is whether \"can necessarily determine the oxidation states\". For example, if V1/V2 is 1, then they have same oxidation state. But if V1/V2 is 2, then maybe X is +2 and Y is +1, or X is +4 and Y is +2. But since they are short-period metals, oxidation states are limited. Let's check. For short-period metals, possible oxidation states:\n\nGroup 1: +1\n\nGroup 2: +2\n\nAluminum (group 13): +3\n\nOther possible metals? Like maybe Be? But Be is sometimes considered a metal. However, in short periods, the possible oxidation states are +1, +2, +3. So if the ratio is, say, 2:3, then n/m = 2/3. Since n and m have to be integers (oxidation states are integers), then possible pairs could be 2 and 3. Since there are metals with +2 (like Mg) and +3 (Al). Therefore, if the ratio is 2/3, then you can say that X has +2 and Y has +3. Similarly, if ratio is 1/2, then X is +1 and Y is +2. If ratio is 1/3, X is +1 and Y is +3. If ratio is 2/1, then X is +2 and Y is +1, etc. Since there are no metals in short periods with oxidation states higher than +3, then given the ratio, you can determine the oxidation states. So statement D says \"The ratio V1/V2 can necessarily determine the oxidation states of X and Y in the products.\" So that's correct? Because given the ratio, and knowing that oxidation states are limited to +1, +2, +3, you can figure out the exact oxidation states. Therefore D is correct? Wait, but what if the ratio is something like 1:1? Then both have same oxidation state. But there could be different metals with same oxidation state. For example, both X and Y could be +1 (like Na and K), but you can't determine their exact oxidation states, but the statement says \"the oxidation states in the products\". If the ratio is 1:1, then their oxidation states are same. So the statement says \"can necessarily determine the oxidation states\". So even if you can't tell if it's +1 or +2, but given the ratio, you can know the ratio of oxidation states. Wait, but the statement says \"determine the oxidation states\". Hmm. Let me think again. If V1/V2 = n/m. If you know V1/V2, you know n/m. But unless you have more information, you can't know the exact values of n and m. For example, if V1/V2 = 1, then n/m = 1, so n = m. But you don't know if they are +1 or +2. However, the problem states that X and Y are metals in short periods. So possible oxidation states are +1, +2, +3. However, if the ratio is 1, you can't know if both are +1, both +2, or both +3. Therefore, statement D says \"can necessarily determine the oxidation states\". But if the ratio is 1, you can't determine if they are +1, +2, or +3. Therefore, statement D is incorrect? Wait, but maybe there's another way. Wait, the problem says that they are reacting with HCl and H2SO4. Wait, does the type of acid affect the oxidation state? For example, maybe the reaction with sulfuric acid could lead to different products if the metal is more reactive? No, the oxidation state of the metal in the product depends on the metal itself, not the acid. For example, Mg reacts with HCl to form MgCl2 (Mg^2+), and with H2SO4 to form MgSO4 (Mg^2+). So same oxidation state. Therefore, the oxidation state is determined by the metal. Therefore, given V1/V2 = n/m, but if the ratio is 1, you can't determine the exact oxidation states. So statement D is incorrect? But the options are to pick the incorrect statement. So maybe D is incorrect? Wait, but the question says \"the following statement is incorrect\". Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: The ratio V1/V2 can necessarily determine the oxidation states of X and Y in the products.\n\nBut if the ratio is 1, you can't determine if they are both +1, +2, or +3. Therefore, you can't necessarily determine the oxidation states. Therefore D is incorrect. However, maybe the problem assumes that the oxidation states are unique? For example, if they are in different groups? Wait, but the problem doesn't give any more information. Therefore, statement D is incorrect. But let me check the other options first to see if there's another incorrect one.\n\nLooking at option A: The ratio of the amount of substance of H2 produced by X and Y is necessarily V1/V2.\n\nSince volume ratio is same as mole ratio (at same T and P), then yes, the ratio of moles of H2 is V1/V2. Therefore A is correct.\n\nOption B: The ratio of the amount of acid consumed by X and Y is necessarily 2V1 / V2.\n\nLet me think. Let's calculate the moles of acid consumed.\n\nFor X reacting with HCl:\n\nThe reaction is, as before, for a metal with oxidation state n:\n\nM + n HCl → MCl_n + (n/2) H2\n\nSo moles of HCl consumed is n * moles of M. Since moles of M is 0.1, moles of HCl is 0.1 * n.\n\nSimilarly, for Y reacting with H2SO4:\n\nThe reaction would be:\n\nM + (n/2) H2SO4 → MSO4 + (n/2) H2 ?\n\nWait, let me think. For sulfuric acid, which provides 2 H+ per molecule. Let me take an example.\n\nFor Mg (oxidation state +2):\n\nMg + H2SO4 → MgSO4 + H2↑\n\nSo 1 mole of Mg reacts with 1 mole of H2SO4. Because H2SO4 provides 2 H+ ions. The reaction is:\n\nMg + 2 H+ → Mg^2+ + H2↑\n\nBut H2SO4 is the source of H+.\n\nSo in general, for a metal with oxidation state n:\n\nThe reaction is:\n\nM + (n/2) H2SO4 → MSO4 + (n/2) H2↑ ?\n\nWait, let me balance it properly. Let me think in terms of H+.\n\nEach H+ provides one H. For the metal with oxidation state +n, the reaction is:\n\nM + n H+ → M^n+ + (n/2) H2\n\nTherefore, for HCl (which provides 1 H+ per molecule), moles of HCl needed is n * moles of metal.\n\nFor H2SO4, which provides 2 H+ per molecule, moles of H2SO4 needed is (n/2) * moles of metal.\n\nTherefore, for X (reacting with HCl), acid consumed is n * 0.1 mol.\n\nFor Y (reacting with H2SO4), acid consumed is (m / 2) * 0.1 mol.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of acid consumed (X/Y) is [n * 0.1] / [ (m/2) * 0.1 ] = 2n / m.\n\nBut the statement B says the ratio is 2V1 / V2. Since earlier we found that V1/V2 = n/m. Therefore, 2n/m = 2*(V1/V2). Therefore, the ratio of acid consumed is 2*(V1/V2). But statement B says the ratio is 2V1 / V2. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the question says: \"The ratio of the amount of acid consumed by X and Y is necessarily 2V1 / V2\".\n\nSo the ratio (acid consumed X) / (acid consumed Y) is 2n/m, and since V1/V2 = n/m, then 2n/m = 2*(V1/V2). Therefore, the ratio is 2*(V1/V2). But statement B says the ratio is 2V1 / V2. Which would be different. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nIf the ratio of acid consumed is (acid X)/(acid Y) = 2n/m. And since V1/V2 = n/m, then 2n/m = 2*(V1/V2). Therefore, the ratio is 2*(V1/V2). But statement B says the ratio is 2V1 / V2. Which would be different. Wait, is there a miscalculation here?\n\nWait, let me redo the calculation.\n\nFor X: moles of HCl consumed is n * 0.1 mol.\n\nFor Y: moles of H2SO4 consumed is (m / 2) * 0.1 mol.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of acid consumed (X:Y) is [n * 0.1] / [ (m/2) * 0.1 ] = [n] / [m/2] = 2n/m.\n\nSince V1/V2 = n/m (as established before), then 2n/m = 2*(V1/V2). Therefore, the ratio of acid consumed is 2*(V1/V2). Therefore, statement B says the ratio is 2V1 / V2. Wait, but 2*(V1/V2) is different from 2V1 / V2. Wait, no. If the ratio is (acid X)/(acid Y) = 2n/m = 2*(n/m) = 2*(V1/V2). Therefore, the ratio is 2*(V1/V2). But the statement says the ratio is 2V1 / V2. Which would be the same as 2*(V1/V2). Therefore, statement B is correct. So B is correct. Therefore, my previous confusion was unnecessary. So statement B is correct.\n\nSo far, A is correct, B is correct. Let's check C.\n\nOption C: The ratio of the oxidation states of X and Y in the products is necessarily V1 / V2.\n\nEarlier we found that V1/V2 = n/m, where n is oxidation state of X and m is oxidation state of Y. Therefore, the ratio of oxidation states is n/m = V1/V2. Therefore, statement C is correct. Because the ratio of oxidation states is V1/V2.\n\nWait, but statement C says \"the ratio of the oxidation states of X and Y in the products is necessarily V1 / V2\". Which is exactly what we have. Since V1/V2 = n/m. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nThen, if all A, B, C are correct, then the incorrect one is D. Which we discussed earlier. Because D says that the ratio V1/V2 can necessarily determine the oxidation states. But if the ratio is 2/2, meaning V1/V2 = 1, then we know that n/m = 1, so n = m, but we don't know if they are both +1, +2, or +3. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact oxidation states, only their ratio. Therefore, statement D is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check again. For example, suppose V1/V2 is 1. Then oxidation states are same. But since they are metals in short periods, possible oxidation states are +1, +2, +3. However, without additional information, we can't know if they are +1, +2, or +3. Therefore, D is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possibility. For example, if the ratio is 1, but maybe the metals have different oxidation states but the ratio is same. But no, if the ratio is n/m = 1, then n=m. So oxidation states are same. However, the actual value is not determined. The statement D says \"can necessarily determine the oxidation states\". If you can only determine the ratio, not the actual values, then you can't determine the oxidation states. Therefore, D is incorrect. So the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if there is any case where even with ratio, you can determine the oxidation states. For example, if one of the volumes is zero? No, since they are metals reacting with acid to produce H2. Also, given that they are short-period metals, and reacting with acid, so likely they are active metals. But even so, if V1/V2 is 1, you can't say if they are +1 or +2. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nSo the incorrect statement is D. Therefore, the answer is D, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
