Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, weight percent means that 50 grams of NaOH are dissolved in 100 grams of solution. So, if I have 100 grams of the solution, 50 grams are NaOH and the other 50 grams must be water. Right? Because weight percent is (mass of solute / mass of solution) * 100%, so 50% means 50g solute in 100g total.\n\nNow, mole fraction is the number of moles of NaOH divided by the total number of moles of all components in the solution. The formula for mole fraction (X) is:\n\nX_NaOH = moles of NaOH / (moles of NaOH + moles of water)\n\nSo, I need to calculate the moles of NaOH and the moles of water.\n\nFirst, let's get the molar mass of NaOH. Sodium (Na) is about 22.99 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) is 1.01 g/mol. Adding those together: 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol. So, the molar mass of NaOH is 40.00 g/mol.\n\nNow, moles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass = 50 g / 40.00 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 50 divided by 40 is 1.25 moles. So, moles of NaOH is 1.25.\n\nNext, the mass of water is 50 grams. The molar mass of water (H2O) is 2*(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol. So, moles of water = 50 g / 18.02 g/mol. Let me compute that. 50 divided by 18.02... Let me do this division. 18.02 times 2 is 36.04, subtract that from 50, you get 13.96. 18.02 goes into 13.96 about 0.77 times. So approximately 2.77 moles? Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should use a calculator step by step.\n\nWait, 50 / 18.02. Let me approximate. 18.02 * 2.7 = 18.02 * 2 + 18.02 * 0.7 = 36.04 + 12.614 = 48.654. That's close to 50. The difference is 50 - 48.654 = 1.346. So, how much more is that? Since 18.02 * x = 1.346. x ≈ 1.346 / 18.02 ≈ 0.0747. So total moles ≈ 2.7 + 0.0747 ≈ 2.7747. So approximately 2.775 moles of water. Let me verify with exact calculation. 50 / 18.02 ≈ 2.7747. Yes, so roughly 2.775 moles.\n\nTherefore, total moles in solution is moles of NaOH + moles of water = 1.25 + 2.775 ≈ 4.025 moles.\n\nThen, mole fraction of NaOH is 1.25 / 4.025 ≈ Let's compute that. 1.25 divided by 4.025. Let me do this division. 4.025 goes into 1.25 how many times? Since 4.025 * 0.3 = 1.2075. Subtract that from 1.25: 1.25 - 1.2075 = 0.0425. Then, 4.025 * x = 0.0425. x ≈ 0.0425 / 4.025 ≈ 0.01056. So total mole fraction ≈ 0.3 + 0.01056 ≈ 0.31056. So approximately 0.3106. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 0.311, which is very close to 0.3106. So that's probably the answer. Let me check if I made any calculation errors.\n\nWait, let me recheck the moles of water. 50 grams of water divided by 18.015 g/mol (exact molar mass of water is approximately 18.01528 g/mol). So 50 / 18.015 ≈ Let me compute this more accurately. Let me use calculator steps. 18.015 * 2.77 = 18.015 * 2 + 18.015 * 0.77 = 36.03 + 13.87155 = 49.90155. That's very close to 50 grams. So 2.77 moles would give 49.90 grams. The difference is 50 - 49.90 = 0.10 grams. So, 0.10 grams / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.00555 moles. So total moles ≈ 2.77 + 0.00555 ≈ 2.77555 moles. So that's 2.7756 moles. So moles of water is approximately 2.7756.\n\nMoles of NaOH is 50 / 40 = 1.25. So total moles is 1.25 + 2.7756 = 4.0256 moles.\n\nMole fraction is 1.25 / 4.0256 ≈ Let me calculate this division more accurately. 1.25 divided by 4.0256. Let's do decimal division.\n\nLet me write 1.25 ÷ 4.0256. Let me convert this into 1250 ÷ 4025.6. Alternatively, approximate decimal.\n\nSince 4.0256 * 0.3 = 1.20768\n\nSubtract that from 1.25: 1.25 - 1.20768 = 0.04232\n\nNow, 0.04232 / 4.0256 ≈ 0.01051\n\nSo total is 0.3 + 0.01051 ≈ 0.31051, which is approximately 0.3105. So about 0.3105, which rounds to 0.311. So option C is 0.311. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any mistake in the initial assumption. The problem says 50% weight of sodium hydroxide dissolved in water. So the total solution is 100 grams, 50 grams NaOH and 50 grams water. Is that correct? Yes, because weight percent is (mass of solute / mass of solution) * 100. So if it's 50%, then yes, 50g NaOH in 100g solution, so 50g water. So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: molar masses. Na is 22.99, O is 16.00, H is 1.01. So NaOH is 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol. Correct. Water is 18.02 g/mol. Correct.\n\nSo calculations seem correct. Therefore, mole fraction is approximately 0.311, so answer C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the question is asking for mole percent or mole fraction. The options are given as percentages for A and D, but B and C are decimal. The question says \"mole fraction of sodium hydroxide\". Mole fraction is a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1. So the options A and D are percentages (31.00% and 0.5), while B and C are decimals (0.164 and 0.311). Since mole fraction is 0.311, which is option C. So answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C:0.311.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
