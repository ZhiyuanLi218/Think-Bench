Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the rocket's momentum after it ejects some exhaust gases. The given data is: the rocket has a mass of 1.00 kg, and it ejects 50 grams of exhaust gases at a speed of 600 m/s. They want the magnitude of the rocket's momentum right after the ejection. The options are given, and we need to pick the correct one. Alright, let's start.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with rockets and ejection of mass, conservation of momentum might come into play here. Since there are no external forces acting on the system during the ejection (they mentioned to ignore gravity and air resistance), the total momentum should be conserved. But wait, initially, the rocket and the exhaust gases are at rest, right? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the rocket is being launched, so maybe it was already moving? Hmm, but the problem says \"at the moment after the gases are ejected,\" so maybe we need to consider the initial state before ejection and the final state after ejection.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify. The rocket is ignited and launched. So, maybe before ejection, the rocket is at rest? Or is it already moving? Hmm. The problem says \"in a very short time,\" so maybe we can assume that the ejection happens so quickly that the rocket hasn't had time to move significantly yet. Therefore, the initial momentum of the system (rocket + exhaust gases) is zero because everything is at rest? Wait, but the rocket is being launched. Wait, maybe I need to think about the system more carefully.\n\nThe total system includes the rocket and the exhaust gases. Before the ejection, the entire mass is the rocket plus the exhaust gases. After ejection, the rocket has lost some mass (the exhaust gases), and that mass is moving in the opposite direction. Since there are no external forces, the total momentum should remain the same as before the ejection. If the rocket was initially at rest, then total momentum is zero. Therefore, after ejection, the momentum of the rocket plus the momentum of the exhaust gases should still add up to zero. Therefore, the rocket's momentum would be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that of the exhaust gases. Therefore, the magnitude of the rocket's momentum would be equal to the magnitude of the exhaust gases' momentum.\n\nSo let me check the numbers. The mass of the exhaust gases is 50 grams, which is 0.05 kg. They are ejected at 600 m/s. So the momentum of the exhaust gases is mass times velocity, which is 0.05 kg * 600 m/s. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 600 = 30 kg·m/s. Therefore, the rocket's momentum should be 30 kg·m/s in the opposite direction. Therefore, the magnitude is 30 kg·m/s. Looking at the options, that's option A. But wait, hold on. The rocket's mass is given as 1.00 kg. Wait, does that include the exhaust gases or not?\n\nWait, the problem says the rocket has a mass of 1.00 kg, and 50 g of exhaust gases are ejected. So, initially, the total mass of the rocket plus fuel would be 1.00 kg plus 0.05 kg? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the 1.00 kg is the mass of the rocket after the ejection? Or before? Hmm. Wait, the wording is: \"A model rocket with a mass of 1.00 kg is ignited and launched, with 50 g of exhaust gases ejected...\" So, probably, the initial mass of the rocket (including the fuel) is 1.00 kg, and then it ejects 50 g of exhaust gases. Therefore, after ejection, the rocket's mass is 1.00 kg minus 0.05 kg = 0.95 kg. However, the problem asks for the rocket's momentum after ejection. But according to the previous logic, if the total momentum is conserved (initially zero), then the rocket's momentum is equal and opposite to the exhaust's momentum. Therefore, regardless of the rocket's mass, the magnitude would be equal to the exhaust's momentum. Wait, but does that take into account the mass of the rocket?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. If the total momentum is zero before ejection, then after ejection, we have:\n\nMomentum_rocket + Momentum_exhaust = 0\n\nTherefore, Momentum_rocket = -Momentum_exhaust.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude is equal. Therefore, regardless of the rocket's mass, as long as the exhaust's momentum is 0.05 kg * 600 m/s = 30 kg·m/s, then the rocket's momentum must be 30 kg·m/s. Therefore, answer A. But why is option A given? But let me check if there is a trick here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Because rockets work by continuously ejecting mass, but here it's a very short time, so maybe it's an impulse problem. However, since the ejection is instantaneous, maybe we can treat it as a sudden ejection of mass. Let me check if the initial momentum is zero. If the rocket is initially at rest, then yes. But if the rocket was already moving, then the initial momentum would not be zero. However, the problem says it's \"launched,\" so maybe the ejection is the initial stage, so the rocket is just starting, so initial velocity is zero. Therefore, initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the answer is 30 kg·m/s. So option A. But let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\n(A) 30 kg·m/s\n\n(B) 5.7 × 10² kg·m/s\n\n(C) 6.0 × 10² kg·m/s\n\n(D) 6.3 × 10² kg·m/s\n\nSo option A is 30. But let me check again. Wait, but the problem says \"the magnitude of the rocket's momentum.\" So if the rocket's mass is 1.00 kg initially, but then it ejects 0.05 kg, so the remaining mass is 0.95 kg. However, if we use the conservation of momentum, the total momentum is zero, so rocket's momentum is equal in magnitude to the exhaust's. So rocket's momentum is 30 kg·m/s. But then, if we wanted the velocity of the rocket, it would be momentum divided by its mass, which is 30 / 0.95 ≈ 31.58 m/s. But the question is only about the momentum. So the answer is 30 kg·m/s. Therefore, option A. But wait, why are there other options? Let me check if I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the initial mass of the rocket is 1.00 kg, and during ejection, the exhaust is part of that mass. Therefore, the total mass before ejection is 1.00 kg, which includes the 50 g of exhaust. Therefore, after ejection, the rocket's mass is 1.00 kg - 0.05 kg = 0.95 kg. But if we use conservation of momentum, initial momentum is zero, so final momentum of rocket plus exhaust is zero. Therefore, rocket's momentum is equal and opposite to exhaust's. Therefore, rocket's momentum is 0.05 kg * 600 m/s = 30 kg·m/s. So answer is A. But let me check if there is a different approach where maybe the rocket's velocity is calculated and then multiplied by its mass, but that would be same thing. So if rocket's momentum is 30, then yes. So answer is A. But let me check why other options are there. For example, option B is 5.7 × 10², which is 570. Option C is 600. Option D is 630. These numbers seem like 600 minus 30 or plus 30. Maybe someone thought that the rocket's momentum is total mass times velocity? But if someone thought that the rocket's velocity is 600 m/s, then 1.00 kg * 600 would be 600, which is option C. But that's wrong because the exhaust is moving at 600 m/s, not the rocket. Alternatively, if someone thought that the total momentum is not zero, but something else?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the frame of reference? For example, if the rocket is on the ground and then it's launched, but during the ejection, maybe there is a normal force from the ground? But the problem says to ignore gravity and air resistance during ejection. Therefore, assuming that the rocket is already in the air? Or maybe it's on the ground, but during the very short ejection time, the impulse from the ground is negligible? Wait, but if it's on the ground, then before ejection, the rocket is at rest, with the ground exerting a normal force balancing gravity. However, during the ejection, the thrust from the engine is acting. However, the problem says to ignore gravity and air resistance during ejection. Therefore, maybe we can assume that the only forces are internal, so conservation of momentum applies. However, if the rocket is on the ground, then during ejection, the ground would exert an external force. But since we are told to ignore gravity and air resistance, maybe we assume that the external forces are negligible, so conservation of momentum holds. Therefore, initial momentum is zero, so final momentum is zero. Therefore, answer is A. But why is there an option A? Maybe the question is a trick? Wait, maybe the rocket is not initially at rest? Wait, the problem says it's \"launched,\" so maybe it's moving upwards? But the ejection happens in a very short time. If the rocket was already moving, then the initial momentum would not be zero. But the problem doesn't specify any initial velocity. So maybe we have to assume initial velocity is zero. Therefore, answer is A. However, the given options include A as 30, which is small compared to others. But let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the rocket's mass as 1.00 kg including the fuel, so when the fuel is ejected, the rocket's mass becomes less, but the question says \"the rocket's momentum,\" so the rocket is now 0.95 kg, moving with some velocity. The exhaust is 0.05 kg moving downward (or opposite direction) with 600 m/s. Therefore, total momentum is zero:\n\n(0.95 kg)(v_rocket) + (0.05 kg)(-600 m/s) = 0\n\nTherefore:\n\n0.95 v_rocket = 0.05 * 600\n\nv_rocket = (0.05 * 600)/0.95 ≈ 30 / 0.95 ≈ 31.58 m/s\n\nTherefore, the rocket's momentum is 0.95 kg * 31.58 m/s ≈ 30 kg·m/s. Which again gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is A. So why are the other options there? Maybe if someone forgot to convert grams to kilograms? Let's check. If someone thought 50 g is 50 kg, then momentum would be 50*600=30,000 kg·m/s, which is way higher. Not in the options. If someone thought that the rocket's velocity is 600 m/s, then 1 kg * 600 = 600, which is option C. But that's not correct. Alternatively, if someone thought that the total mass of the rocket is 1 kg, and the exhaust is 50 g, so total mass 1.05 kg? But no, the problem says the rocket has a mass of 1.00 kg, and 50 g is ejected. So initial mass is 1.00 kg, which includes the 50 g. Therefore, after ejection, 0.95 kg. So no, that doesn't lead to other options. Alternatively, maybe someone thought that the rocket's mass is 1.00 kg, and the exhaust is 50 g, so the ratio is 1.00 / 0.05 = 20, so the velocity is 20 times? But velocity ratio is inverse of mass ratio. So if exhaust is moving at 600 m/s, then rocket's velocity is (mass_exhaust / mass_rocket) * velocity_exhaust. Wait, but in that case, it would be (0.05 / 1.00) * 600 = 30 m/s. Then rocket's momentum is mass_rocket * velocity = 1.00 kg * 30 m/s = 30 kg·m/s. Again, same result. Therefore, answer is A. So why is there an option A? Maybe the answer is A. But I need to check again if there is any misunderstanding.\n\nWait, another thought. The problem says \"the moment after the gases are ejected,\" and it says \"gravity and air resistance can be ignored during the ejection.\" So during ejection, no external forces. Therefore, conservation of momentum applies. Therefore, initial momentum is zero, final is zero. Therefore, rocket's momentum is equal and opposite to exhaust's. So answer is 30. Therefore, option A. But let me check the options again. The options are (A) 30, (B) 5.7 × 10², which is 570, (C) 6.0 × 10² is 600, (D) 6.3 × 10² is 630. So why are B, C, D so high? Maybe the question is not about the rocket's momentum, but something else? Wait, the question says \"the magnitude of the rocket's momentum.\" So if someone thought that the total momentum is not zero, but equals something else. For example, if the rocket was moving upwards with some velocity before ejection. But since the problem says \"in a very short time,\" maybe the rocket was just starting, so initial velocity is zero. Therefore, answer is A. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Wait, 50 grams is 0.05 kg. 0.05 * 600 = 30. Yes. So answer is A. Therefore, I think the correct answer is A. But why is there confusion? Maybe the options are trying to trick us? Let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming initial momentum is zero. Suppose the rocket was already moving with some velocity. But the problem doesn't mention that. It says \"launched,\" so maybe the ejection is the start of the motion. So initial velocity is zero. Therefore, answer is A. So I think A is correct.\n\nBut let me check another approach. Let's think about the thrust equation or rocket equation. The rocket equation is Δv = v_exhaust * ln(m_initial/m_final). But this is for continuous ejection and gives the change in velocity. However, in this case, it's a single ejection of a certain mass, so maybe the Tsiolkovsky equation isn't directly applicable here because that's for continuous ejection. However, for a single ejection, conservation of momentum is the way to go. So again, initial momentum zero, so final momentum of rocket is equal and opposite to exhaust. Therefore, answer is A. Therefore, I think the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, let me check the units again. Exhaust speed is 600 m/s. Mass is 0.05 kg. So momentum is 0.05 * 600 = 30 kg·m/s. Yes. So answer is A. Therefore, the answer should be option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
