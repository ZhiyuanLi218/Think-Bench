The dielectric has a tensor given by ε_ij, and the principal axes are oriented at specific angles relative to the horizontal direction in the paper plane. The third axis is perpendicular to the paper. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about capacitance with dielectrics.\n\nNormally, for a parallel plate capacitor with a uniform isotropic dielectric, the capacitance is C = ε * A / d, where ε is the permittivity of the dielectric. But here, the dielectric is anisotropic, meaning that the permittivity varies with direction. The relationship between D and E is given by D_i = Σ_j ε_ij E_j. Since the dielectric is anisotropic, the electric displacement D and electric field E might not be in the same direction.\n\nThe problem mentions that the principal axes of the dielectric tensor are oriented at certain angles. The first axis (ε₁) is at angle θ relative to the horizontal in the paper plane, and the second axis (ε₂) is at π/2 - θ to the horizontal. The third axis (ε₃) is perpendicular to the paper plane. Since the plates are parallel and separated by d, the electric field should be perpendicular to the plates, right? So if the plates are in the x-y plane (assuming the paper plane is x-y), then the electric field E is along the z-axis.\n\nBut the dielectric tensor's principal axes are in the paper plane and perpendicular to it. Wait, axis 3 is perpendicular to the paper, which would be along the z-axis. So axis 3 is aligned with the direction of the electric field. That seems important. Let me think.\n\nIn an anisotropic material, the electric displacement D is related to E via the dielectric tensor. If the electric field is along the z-axis (since the plates are parallel and the field is uniform between them), then E has components only in the z-direction. But because the dielectric is anisotropic, D might have components in other directions too? Wait, but if the plates are conductors, they are equipotential surfaces, so the electric field must be perpendicular to the plates. However, in an anisotropic material, D is what determines the free charge density on the plates. Let me recall Gauss's law: ∇·D = ρ_free. Since the plates have free charge, the D field should be perpendicular to the plates as well, right? Because the boundary conditions for D: the normal component of D is discontinuous by the free surface charge density, and the tangential components are continuous. But if there's no free charge on the surface except on the plates, then maybe D is purely in the z-direction?\n\nWait, but if the dielectric tensor is anisotropic, then if E is along z, then D would be given by D = ε_3 E_z e_z? No, because if the principal axis 3 is along z, then yes, if the electric field is along the principal axis 3, then D is along E. But if the electric field is not along a principal axis, then D would have components in other directions. But here, the electric field is along z, which is a principal axis. Therefore, maybe D is also along z? Therefore, the relationship simplifies?\n\nLet me check. Suppose that the dielectric tensor has principal axes. If the electric field is along one of the principal axes, then D is parallel to E, with magnitude ε_i E. But if the electric field is not along a principal axis, then D and E are not parallel. However, in this case, since the electric field is along the z-axis, which is a principal axis (axis 3 with ε₃), then D should be along z as well. Therefore, D = ε₃ E. Therefore, maybe the capacitance is similar to the isotropic case, but with ε replaced by ε₃?\n\nBut then why does the problem mention the orientation of the other principal axes (axis 1 and 2 in the paper plane)? If the electric field is along axis 3, then the orientation of axes 1 and 2 in the paper plane shouldn't matter? That seems odd. Maybe I need to verify this.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think again. The principal axes are given as follows: axis 1 is at angle θ from the horizontal direction in the paper plane. Axis 2 is at π/2 - θ to the horizontal direction. So, axes 1 and 2 are in the paper plane, orthogonal to each other (since θ + (π/2 - θ) = π/2). Axis 3 is perpendicular to the paper plane. So if the electric field is along axis 3, then the D field is along axis 3 as well. Therefore, the components of E in the principal axes are E_1 = 0, E_2 = 0, E_3 = E. Therefore, D_1 = ε₁ E_1 = 0, D_2 = ε₂ E_2 = 0, D_3 = ε₃ E_3 = ε₃ E. Therefore, D is along axis 3, which is the same as the direction of E. Therefore, in this case, the D field is purely in the z-direction, same as E, so the capacitance would be C = Q / V, where Q is the charge on the plates, and V is the voltage.\n\nBut how is Q related to D? The surface charge density σ on the plates is equal to D · n, where n is the normal to the surface. Since D is along z, then σ = D_z. Therefore, Q = σ A = D_z A. Also, the electric field E is related to the voltage by E = V / d. Therefore, D_z = ε₃ E = ε₃ V / d. Therefore, Q = ε₃ A V / d, so C = Q / V = ε₃ A / d. Therefore, the capacitance depends on ε₃, not on θ? But the problem says to calculate how the capacitance depends on A, d, ε_i, and θ. If my reasoning is correct, θ does not affect the capacitance. But that seems strange. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The principal axis 3 is perpendicular to the paper plane, which is the direction of the electric field. Therefore, regardless of how the other principal axes are oriented in the plane, since the electric field is along axis 3, the D field is ε₃ E. Therefore, θ does not play any role here. Therefore, the capacitance is C = ε₃ A / d. But why does the problem mention θ then? Maybe there is a misunderstanding in the setup.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement. The plates are separated by distance d, with an anisotropic dielectric. The principal axes of the dielectric tensor: axis 1 is at angle θ relative to the horizontal direction in the paper plane; axis 2 is at π/2 - θ to the horizontal direction; axis 3 is perpendicular to the paper. So, axis 1 and 2 are in-plane, orthogonal, and axis 3 is out-of-plane. The electric field is along axis 3, so D is along axis 3. Therefore, θ does not affect the relation between D and E here. Therefore, the capacitance is C = ε₃ A / d. Therefore, θ does not affect the capacitance. But the problem says to calculate how it depends on θ. Therefore, my reasoning must be wrong.\n\nHmm, where is the mistake? Maybe the electric field is not along axis 3? How is the electric field oriented?\n\nIn a parallel plate capacitor, the electric field is perpendicular to the plates. If the plates are horizontal, then the electric field is vertical. If the dielectric is anisotropic, but the electric field is along the direction of one of the principal axes, then D is parallel to E. However, if the electric field is not along a principal axis, then D and E are not parallel. However, in this case, since axis 3 is perpendicular to the paper plane (i.e., along the direction of the electric field), then the electric field is along axis 3. Therefore, D is along axis 3. Therefore, θ doesn't matter. Therefore, the capacitance is C = ε₃ A / d. But the problem says to calculate how it depends on θ. Therefore, there must be something wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the dielectric is not aligned such that axis 3 is along the electric field? Wait, the problem says that axis 3 is perpendicular to the paper plane. If the plates are in the paper plane, then the electric field is perpendicular to the paper plane. Therefore, axis 3 is aligned with the electric field. Therefore, D is along axis 3. Therefore, θ does not affect the result. But the problem says to calculate how the capacitance depends on θ. Therefore, my reasoning is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the dielectric tensor is not diagonal in the coordinate system where the electric field is along z? Wait, no. The principal axes are the directions where the dielectric tensor is diagonal. So if axis 3 is along z, then in the principal axis coordinate system, the dielectric tensor is diagonal with ε₁, ε₂, ε₃. But if the electric field is along z, then D is ε₃ E. Therefore, regardless of how the other principal axes are oriented in the plane, since E is along axis 3, θ doesn't matter. Therefore, the answer is C = ε₃ A / d. But then why is θ given?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the orientation of the principal axes. Let me think again. The problem says:\n\nAxis 1 (eigenvalue ε₁) is at an angle θ relative to the horizontal direction in the paper plane.\n\nAxis 2 (eigenvalue ε₂) is at an angle π/2 - θ to the horizontal direction in the paper plane.\n\nAxis 3 is perpendicular to the paper plane.\n\nTherefore, axes 1 and 2 are in the paper plane, orthogonal to each other. So, for example, if θ is zero, axis 1 is horizontal, axis 2 is vertical. If θ is π/4, axis 1 is at 45 degrees from horizontal, axis 2 is at 45 degrees from vertical. But axis 3 is vertical if the plates are horizontal. Wait, if the plates are in the paper plane, then the electric field is perpendicular to the paper plane (along axis 3). Therefore, regardless of θ, axis 3 is aligned with the electric field. Therefore, D is ε₃ E. Therefore, θ does not affect the capacitance. Therefore, the answer is C = ε₃ A / d. But the problem says to calculate how it depends on θ. Therefore, perhaps my assumption that the electric field is along axis 3 is wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the electric field is not along axis 3? How can that be? In a parallel plate capacitor, the electric field is perpendicular to the plates. If the dielectric is anisotropic, but the boundary conditions require that the tangential component of E is continuous. However, if there is no free charge on the plates except on the surfaces, then the electric field should be purely normal to the plates. Wait, but in an anisotropic material, the D field is not necessarily parallel to E. However, in the case of a parallel plate capacitor, the boundary conditions are such that the tangential component of E is zero? Wait, no. The boundary conditions for E are that the tangential component is continuous across the boundary. However, if we have a dielectric filling the entire space between the plates, then there are no other materials to have discontinuities. So, if the plates are conductors, then the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore, just outside the conductor, the tangential component of E must be zero. Therefore, the electric field must be purely normal to the plates. Therefore, E is along z-axis, which is axis 3. Therefore, D is ε₃ E. Therefore, θ does not matter. Therefore, the capacitance is C = ε₃ A / d.\n\nBut the problem says to calculate how it depends on θ. Therefore, maybe there is a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Perhaps the dielectric is not filling the entire space between the plates? Or perhaps the plates are not aligned with the paper plane? Wait, the problem says the plates are separated by distance d, with the dielectric between them. The principal axes are defined with respect to the paper plane. So if the plates are in the paper plane, then the electric field is perpendicular to the paper plane, which is axis 3. Therefore, θ is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is C = ε₃ A / d. But the problem says to calculate how it depends on θ. Therefore, maybe my assumption that E is along axis 3 is incorrect?\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose that the dielectric tensor is not aligned with the electric field. For example, if the electric field is not along a principal axis, then D and E are not parallel. However, in this case, the electric field is along axis 3, which is a principal axis. Therefore, D is parallel to E. Therefore, θ is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is C = ε₃ A / d. Therefore, maybe the problem is trying to test whether I can recognize that θ does not affect the capacitance in this configuration. But why then mention θ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation here. Let me think of another approach. Let me consider the dielectric tensor in the lab frame (where the plates are horizontal and vertical). Suppose that the principal axes are rotated with respect to the lab frame. Let me define coordinate systems. Let me assume that the lab frame is x, y, z, where the plates are in the x-y plane, separated along the z-axis. The dielectric tensor in the principal axis frame (let's say x', y', z') has components ε₁, ε₂, ε₃ along the principal axes. The principal axes are such that x' is at angle θ from the x-axis (horizontal), y' is at angle π/2 - θ from the x-axis (so that x' and y' are orthogonal in the paper plane), and z' is along z-axis.\n\nTherefore, to find the dielectric tensor in the lab frame, we need to rotate the principal axis frame by θ around the z-axis. Wait, if axis x' is at angle θ from the x-axis in the paper plane, then the rotation is in the x-y plane. Therefore, the transformation matrix from principal axes (x', y', z') to lab frame (x, y, z) is a rotation by θ around the z-axis. Therefore, the dielectric tensor in the lab frame can be found by rotating the principal axis tensor.\n\nBut since the electric field is along z-axis, which is the same as z', then in the lab frame, E is along z. Therefore, let me compute D in the lab frame. Since D_i = Σ_j ε_ij E_j. Since E is along z, E_x = E_y = 0, E_z = E. Therefore, D_x = ε_xz E_z, D_y = ε_yz E_z, D_z = ε_zz E_z. However, in the principal axis frame, since E is along z', which is same as z, then D' is along z', so D'_x' = 0, D'_y' = 0, D'_z' = ε₃ E_z. Therefore, if I can find the components of D in the lab frame, by transforming D' from principal axis frame to lab frame.\n\nSince D' is along z', which is same as z, so D in lab frame is same as D', because z is same. Therefore, D_x = 0, D_y = 0, D_z = ε₃ E_z. Therefore, in the lab frame, the dielectric tensor must satisfy D_x = ε_xz E_z = 0, D_y = ε_yz E_z = 0, D_z = ε_zz E_z = ε₃ E_z. Therefore, the components ε_xz and ε_yz must be zero? But if the dielectric tensor in the lab frame is obtained by rotating the principal axis tensor, then maybe ε_xz and ε_yz are not zero? Wait, but we know that D_x must be zero because D is along z. Therefore, there must be some relations here.\n\nWait, let me think. The dielectric tensor in the lab frame is obtained by rotating the principal axis tensor. Let me recall that for a tensor, when you rotate the coordinate system, the components transform accordingly. Let me denote the rotation matrix as R. Since we are rotating the principal axis frame (x', y', z') by θ around z to get the lab frame (x, y, z). The rotation matrix R is:\n\n[cosθ, -sinθ, 0]\n[sinθ, cosθ, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n\nTherefore, the dielectric tensor in the lab frame is given by ε = R ε' R^T, where ε' is the diagonal matrix with ε₁, ε₂, ε₃ on the diagonal.\n\nTherefore, let me compute ε in the lab frame. Let me denote ε' as diag(ε₁, ε₂, ε₃). Then, ε in the lab frame will be:\n\nFor the first row, first column:\n\nε_xx = R_{1i} R_{1j} ε'_{ij} ?\n\nWait, more accurately, for a second-rank tensor, the transformation is ε = R ε' R^T. Therefore, the components are:\n\nε_ij = Σ_{i',j'} R_{i i'} R_{j j'} ε'_{i' j'}\n\nBut since ε' is diagonal, ε'_{i' j'} = 0 unless i' = j', so:\n\nε_ij = Σ_{i'} R_{i i'} R_{j i'} ε'_{i'}\n\nTherefore, for example, ε_xz is:\n\nε_xz = Σ_{i'} R_{x i'} R_{z i'} ε'_{i'}\n\nBut R_{z i'} is non-zero only when i' = z, since the rotation is in x-y plane. Therefore, R_{x z} = 0, R_{z z} = 1. Therefore, ε_xz = Σ_{i'} R_{x i'} R_{z i'} ε'_{i'} = R_{x z} R_{z z} ε'_{z} + ... but since i' can be x', y', z', but R_{x z'} = 0 because rotation is in x'-y' plane. Therefore, ε_xz = 0. Similarly, ε_yz = 0. Therefore, in the lab frame, the dielectric tensor components ε_xz and ε_yz are zero. Therefore, when E is along z, D_x = ε_xz E_z = 0, D_y = ε_yz E_z = 0, D_z = ε_zz E_z. And ε_zz is equal to ε'_{zz} = ε₃. Therefore, D_z = ε₃ E_z. Therefore, this confirms my previous conclusion. Therefore, the capacitance is C = ε₃ A / d, independent of θ. Therefore, θ does not affect the capacitance. Therefore, the answer is C = ε₃ A / d.\n\nBut why does the problem mention θ? Maybe there is a trick here. Wait, let me check if axis 3 is really along the z-axis. The problem says axis 3 is perpendicular to the paper plane. If the plates are in the paper plane, then yes, the electric field is along axis 3. But suppose that axis 3 is not along the direction of the electric field? For example, if the dielectric is rotated such that axis 3 is not perpendicular? But no, the problem says axis 3 is perpendicular to the paper plane. So if the plates are in the paper plane, then electric field is along axis 3. Therefore, θ is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is C = ε₃ A / d. Therefore, maybe the problem is trying to test whether one can realize that only the permittivity component along the field direction matters, regardless of the orientation of other components. Therefore, θ does not affect the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in assuming that the dielectric tensor in the lab frame has ε_xz = 0. Let me do the explicit calculation.\n\nLet me compute the dielectric tensor in the lab frame. Since ε' is diagonal with ε₁, ε₂, ε₃. The rotation is around z-axis by θ. Therefore, the components of ε in the lab frame can be calculated as follows:\n\nε_xx = ε₁ cos²θ + ε₂ sin²θ\n\nε_xy = (ε₂ - ε₁) sinθ cosθ\n\nε_xz = 0\n\nSimilarly,\n\nε_yy = ε₁ sin²θ + ε₂ cos²θ\n\nε_yz = 0\n\nε_zz = ε₃\n\nAnd other components like ε_yx = ε_xy, etc.\n\nTherefore, the dielectric tensor in the lab frame is:\n\n[ε₁ cos²θ + ε₂ sin²θ, (ε₂ - ε₁) sinθ cosθ, 0]\n\n[(ε₂ - ε₁) sinθ cosθ, ε₁ sin²θ + ε₂ cos²θ, 0]\n\n[0, 0, ε₃]\n\nTherefore, if the electric field is along z, then E_x = E_y = 0, E_z = E. Therefore, D_x = ε_xz E_z + ... but since ε_xz = 0, D_x = 0. Similarly, D_y = 0, D_z = ε_zz E_z = ε₃ E_z. Therefore, even though the dielectric tensor in the lab frame has components depending on θ in the x-y plane, since E is along z, those components do not come into play. Therefore, D is purely along z with magnitude ε₃ E. Therefore, the capacitance is indeed C = ε₃ A / d, independent of θ.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C = (ε₃ A)/d. However, the problem says to calculate how the capacitance depends on A, d, ε_i, and θ. If θ does not affect the result, then the answer is simply proportional to ε₃. But maybe there is a misunderstanding in the problem's description of the principal axes?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the principal axes of the dielectric constant tensor are: Axis 1 (eigenvalue ε₁) is at an angle θ relative to the horizontal direction in the paper plane; Axis 2 (eigenvalue ε₂) is at an angle π/2 - θ to the horizontal direction in the paper plane; Axis 3 (eigenvalue ε₃) is perpendicular to the paper plane.\"\n\nWait, if axis 1 is at angle θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is at π/2 - θ from horizontal, then they are orthogonal? Let me check: the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is θ - (π/2 - θ) = 2θ - π/2? Wait, no. If axis 1 is at angle θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is at angle π/2 - θ from horizontal, then the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is (π/2 - θ) - θ = π/2 - 2θ? Wait, that would only be if θ is measured from the same direction. Wait, suppose horizontal is the x-axis. Axis 1 is at angle θ from x-axis. Axis 2 is at angle π/2 - θ from x-axis. Therefore, the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is (π/2 - θ) - θ = π/2 - 2θ? That would only be if θ < π/4. For example, if θ = 0, axis 1 is along x, axis 2 is at π/2 from x, so they are orthogonal. If θ = π/4, axis 1 is at π/4 from x, axis 2 is at π/2 - π/4 = π/4 from x? No, π/2 - θ when θ is π/4 is π/4. So axis 2 is at π/4 from x-axis? But then axis 1 and axis 2 are both at π/4 from x-axis? That can't be, since they are supposed to be orthogonal. Wait, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, if axis 1 is at θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is at π/2 - θ from horizontal, then if θ is measured from horizontal, and axis 2 is measured from horizontal as π/2 - θ, then the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is π/2 - θ - θ = π/2 - 2θ? Wait, no. Suppose axis 1 makes angle θ with x-axis, axis 2 makes angle π/2 - θ with x-axis. Then the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is |(π/2 - θ) - θ| = π/2 - 2θ. For them to be orthogonal, this angle should be π/2. Therefore, π/2 - 2θ = π/2 ⇒ θ = 0. Which is only true if θ = 0. But that contradicts the problem statement that says axes 1 and 2 are principal axes (which should be orthogonal). Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says: Axis 1 is at angle θ relative to the horizontal direction in the paper plane; Axis 2 is at π/2 - θ to the horizontal direction in the paper plane. So, if axis 1 is θ above horizontal, axis 2 is π/2 - θ above horizontal. Therefore, if θ is measured from horizontal, then axis 2 is π/2 - θ from horizontal. Therefore, if axis 1 is θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is π/2 - θ from horizontal, then the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is (π/2 - θ) - θ = π/2 - 2θ. For them to be orthogonal, this angle should be π/2. Therefore:\n\nπ/2 - 2θ = π/2 ⇒ θ = 0. Which is only true when θ = 0. But that would mean that axis 1 is along horizontal, axis 2 is along vertical. For other θ, they are not orthogonal? That contradicts the fact that principal axes are orthogonal. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or my interpretation.\n\nWait, no. If axis 1 is at angle θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is at angle θ + π/2 from horizontal, then they would be orthogonal. But the problem says axis 2 is at π/2 - θ from horizontal. So unless θ + (π/2 - θ) = π/2, which is π/2. Wait, no, the angle between them would be π/2 - θ - θ = π/2 - 2θ. Which is only π/2 when θ = 0. Therefore, there is inconsistency here. Therefore, maybe the problem meant that axis 2 is at angle θ + π/2 from horizontal? Or maybe axis 2 is at angle θ from vertical?\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says: Axis 1 (eigenvalue ε₁) is at an angle θ relative to the horizontal direction in the paper plane; Axis 2 (eigenvalue ε₂) is at an angle π/2 - θ to the horizontal direction in the paper plane. Therefore, axis 2 is π/2 - θ relative to horizontal, which is θ relative to vertical. Because π/2 - θ from horizontal is θ from vertical. For example, if θ = 30°, then axis 2 is 60° from horizontal, which is 30° from vertical. Therefore, axis 1 is θ from horizontal, axis 2 is θ from vertical. Therefore, the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is θ + θ = 2θ? Wait, no. If axis 1 is θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is θ from vertical, then the angle between them is π/2 - θ - θ = π/2 - 2θ? Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. Suppose horizontal is x-axis, vertical is y-axis. Axis 1 makes angle θ with x-axis. Axis 2 makes angle θ with y-axis. Therefore, axis 2 makes angle π/2 - θ with x-axis. Therefore, the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is (π/2 - θ) - θ = π/2 - 2θ. For them to be orthogonal, π/2 - 2θ = π/2 ⇒ θ = 0. Which is only when θ = 0. But principal axes must be orthogonal. Therefore, there is a contradiction here. Therefore, my interpretation must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem means that axis 2 is at angle π/2 - θ relative to axis 1? If axis 1 is at angle θ from horizontal, then axis 2 is at angle θ + π/2 - θ = π/2 from axis 1. That would make them orthogonal. But the problem says axis 2 is at π/2 - θ to the horizontal direction. So maybe there is a translation error or typo? Or perhaps the angle is measured differently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and there is a misunderstanding in my part. Let me think. If the principal axes are in the paper plane, and they are orthogonal, then if axis 1 is at angle θ from horizontal, axis 2 must be at angle θ + π/2 from horizontal. However, the problem says axis 2 is at π/2 - θ from horizontal. Therefore, θ + π/2 = π/2 - θ ⇒ θ = 0. Which is only true for θ = 0. Therefore, the problem statement seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says:\n\n\"Axis 1 (eigenvalue ε₁) is at an angle θ relative to the horizontal direction in the paper plane; Axis 2 (eigenvalue ε₂) is at an angle π/2 - θ to the horizontal direction in the paper plane; Axis 3 (eigenvalue ε₃) is perpendicular to the paper plane.\"\n\nAh! Wait, maybe \"to the horizontal direction\" for axis 2 is meant to be \"relative to the horizontal direction\". If axis 1 is at angle θ relative to horizontal, and axis 2 is at angle π/2 - θ relative to horizontal, then if θ is measured from horizontal, then axis 2 is π/2 - θ from horizontal, which is θ from vertical. Therefore, if axis 1 is θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is θ from vertical, then they are orthogonal? Let me see: suppose θ is 30 degrees. Axis 1 is 30 degrees from horizontal, axis 2 is 30 degrees from vertical. Then the angle between them is 30 + 30 = 60 degrees? No, wait. If axis 1 is 30 degrees from horizontal, then it is 60 degrees from vertical. Axis 2 is 30 degrees from vertical, so the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is 60 - 30 = 30 degrees? No, this is confusing. Let me use coordinates.\n\nLet me define horizontal as x-axis, vertical as y-axis. Let axis 1 make angle θ with x-axis. Let axis 2 make angle φ with x-axis. For them to be orthogonal, the dot product of their direction vectors should be zero. The direction vector of axis 1 is (cosθ, sinθ). The direction vector of axis 2 is (cosφ, sinφ). Their dot product is cosθ cosφ + sinθ sinφ = cos(θ - φ) = 0. Therefore, θ - φ = ±π/2. Therefore, φ = θ ± π/2. Therefore, if axis 1 is at θ from x-axis, axis 2 should be at θ + π/2 from x-axis to be orthogonal. However, the problem says axis 2 is at π/2 - θ from x-axis. Therefore, φ = π/2 - θ. Therefore, the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is |θ - (π/2 - θ)| = |2θ - π/2|. For this to be π/2, |2θ - π/2| = π/2 ⇒ 2θ - π/2 = ±π/2 ⇒ 2θ = π or 0 ⇒ θ = π/2 or 0. Which is only true for θ = 0 or π/2. Therefore, for general θ, axes 1 and 2 are not orthogonal. This contradicts the fact that principal axes are orthogonal. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that axis 2 is at an angle π/2 - θ relative to axis 1? If axis 1 is at θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is at π/2 - θ from axis 1, then the angle between them is π/2 - θ, and the angle of axis 2 from horizontal is θ + (π/2 - θ) = π/2. Which would make axis 2 vertical. But then axis 3 is perpendicular to paper, so that would make axis 1 horizontal, axis 2 vertical, axis 3 out-of-plane. But then θ would be zero. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and axis 2 is at an angle θ + π/2 from the horizontal direction. Then, axes 1 and 2 would be orthogonal. Given that, perhaps the problem statement meant that axis 2 is at θ + π/2 from horizontal, but due to a typo, it says π/2 - θ. However, assuming the problem statement is correct, and there is no typo, then there is inconsistency in the principal axes being non-orthogonal, which is impossible for a real symmetric tensor. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the dielectric tensor is symmetric, so it has orthogonal principal axes. Therefore, the problem statement must be correct in that axes 1 and 2 are orthogonal. Therefore, my previous calculation must be wrong. Let me try again.\n\nLet me suppose that axis 1 is at angle θ from horizontal, and axis 2 is at angle θ + π/2 from horizontal, making them orthogonal. Then, the problem statement might have a typo, saying π/2 - θ instead of θ + π/2. If that is the case, then in the lab frame, the dielectric tensor would have components depending on θ, but when the electric field is along z, the capacitance still depends only on ε₃. However, if the problem statement is as written, with axis 2 at π/2 - θ from horizontal, then the principal axes are not orthogonal, which is impossible. Therefore, I must assume that there is a typo, and axis 2 is at θ + π/2 from horizontal, making them orthogonal. In that case, axis 2 is at θ + π/2 from horizontal, which is π/2 - θ from vertical. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and the angle between axis 1 and axis 2 is π/2, so that π/2 - 2θ = π/2 ⇒ θ = 0, but this only holds for θ = 0. This suggests that the problem is only well-defined for θ = 0, which is trivial. Therefore, this indicates a problem with the problem statement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the principal axes are orthogonal, and the description in the problem is meant to indicate that. Perhaps the angle for axis 2 is supposed to be θ + π/2 from horizontal, making them orthogonal. Assuming that, let me proceed.\n\nIf axis 1 is at θ from horizontal, axis 2 is at θ + π/2 from horizontal, then in this case, when we rotate the principal axis frame by -θ to align axis 1 with the x-axis, the dielectric tensor in the lab frame would have components as calculated before, but with θ. However, since the electric field is along z, the same conclusion applies: C = ε₃ A / d. Therefore, θ does not affect the capacitance.\n\nAlternatively, if the electric field is not along a principal axis, then θ would matter, but in this case, it is. Therefore, the answer is C = ε₃ A / d.\n\nGiven that, and the problem asking to calculate how it depends on θ, but θ does not affect the result, I think the answer is C = (ε₃ A)/d, and θ is irrelevant. Perhaps the problem is designed to test whether one recognizes that only the permittivity component along the field direction matters, regardless of the orientation of other components.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that the capacitance is C = ε₃ A / d, independent of θ.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe capacitance of the system is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\varepsilon_3 A}{d}}.\n</think>"}
