Let me start by recalling Hooke's Law, which states that the force applied to a spring is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position. The formula is F = -kx, where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement. The negative sign indicates that the force is restorative, but since we're dealing with magnitudes here, I can ignore the sign.\n\nNow, the problem says that when a force F₁ is applied, the spring is compressed to a length l₁. When a force F₂ is applied, it's stretched to a length l₂. The spring is within the elastic limit, so Hooke's Law applies.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the displacement for each case. But wait, the problem gives me the lengths l₁ and l₂, but I need to know how much the spring is compressed or stretched from its natural length. Let me denote the natural length of the spring as L. However, the problem doesn't mention the natural length. Hmm, maybe I can express the displacements in terms of l₁ and l₂ without knowing L?\n\nLet me think. When the spring is compressed by force F₁, the length becomes l₁. So the compression distance x₁ would be L - l₁. Similarly, when it's stretched by force F₂, the length is l₂, so the stretch distance x₂ would be l₂ - L. \n\nBut since we don't know L, maybe I can set up two equations and solve for k and L? Let's try that.\n\nFrom Hooke's Law:\n\nF₁ = k * x₁ = k*(L - l₁) [since compression]\n\nF₂ = k * x₂ = k*(l₂ - L) [since extension]\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) F₁ = k(L - l₁)\n\n2) F₂ = k(l₂ - L)\n\nSo now we have two equations with two unknowns: k and L. Let me try to solve these equations for k.\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\nL - l₁ = F₁ / k → L = l₁ + F₁/k\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\nl₂ - L = F₂ / k → L = l₂ - F₂/k\n\nTherefore, setting the two expressions for L equal:\n\nl₁ + F₁/k = l₂ - F₂/k\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nl₁ - l₂ = -F₂/k - F₁/k → l₁ - l₂ = -(F₁ + F₂)/k\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nl₂ - l₁ = (F₁ + F₂)/k\n\nTherefore, solving for k:\n\nk = (F₁ + F₂)/(l₂ - l₁)\n\nSo the spring constant is (F₂ + F₁) divided by (l₂ - l₁). Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) (F₂ - F₁)/(l₂ - l₁)\n\nB) (F₂ + F₁)/(l₂ + l₁)\n\nC) (F₂ + F₁)/(l₂ - l₁)\n\nD) (F₂ - F₁)/(l₂ + l₁)\n\nSo according to my derivation, the correct answer is option C. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the two equations:\n\nF₁ = k(L - l₁)\n\nF₂ = k(l₂ - L)\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\nF₁ + F₂ = k(L - l₁ + l₂ - L) = k(l₂ - l₁)\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, k = (F₁ + F₂)/(l₂ - l₁), which is option C. \n\nBut let me think again: when the spring is compressed, the displacement is L - l₁, and when stretched, displacement is l₂ - L. Adding the two equations gives F₁ + F₂ equals k times (l₂ - l₁). That seems correct. Therefore, option C is correct. \n\nSo the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
