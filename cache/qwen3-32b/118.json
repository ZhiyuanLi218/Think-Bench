So, we have a table of substances in the gaseous state with their relative energies, and some bond energies to consider. The question is asking which of the four options (A to D) is incorrect based on the given data and the reaction mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what bond energy means. Bond energy is the amount of energy required to break a chemical bond in one mole of gaseous molecules. So, higher bond energy means a stronger bond. Also, when bonds are formed, energy is released, and when they're broken, energy is absorbed.\n\nThe given reaction is HO(g) + HO(g) → H2O2(g). They mention that using this reaction, we can calculate the bond energy of the oxygen-oxygen single bond in H2O2 as 214 kJ/mol. Let me verify that first to make sure I understand how the bond energy is calculated here.\n\nLet me think about the reaction HO + HO → H2O2. Each HO molecule is a hydroxyl radical. When two hydroxyl radicals combine, they form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In H2O2, there's an O-O single bond. To find the bond energy of O-O, we need to consider the energy changes in this reaction.\n\nThe energy of the reaction (ΔH) would be the energy required to break bonds minus the energy released when bonds are formed. However, in this case, we are forming H2O2 from two HO radicals. Since HO is a radical, maybe we need to consider the bond dissociation energies here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy values given in the table are the standard enthalpies of formation or some other energy. Wait, the table lists \"Energy\" for each substance. The problem says \"relative energies of the following substances in the gaseous state\". I need to figure out what these energy values represent. Since the units are kJ/mol, and they are given for different substances, perhaps these are the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance? For example, H2 has energy 0, which is typical for the standard state of an element. Similarly, O2 has energy -136? Wait, no. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0, because it's the standard state. But in the table, O2 is listed as -136 kJ/mol. That seems odd. Wait, maybe these are not enthalpies of formation but something else. Let me check the values again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nSubstance (g) | O | H | HO | HOO | H2 | O2 | H2O2 | H2O\nEnergy (kJ/mol) | 249 | 218 | 39 | 10 | 0 | -136 | -242 | ?\n\nWait, H2 is at 0. So perhaps these are the standard enthalpies of formation? But O2 has a negative value here, which would be strange because the standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0. Alternatively, maybe these are the bond dissociation energies? For example, O is an atom, so the energy to form O(g) from O2 would be half the bond energy of O2. But O is given as 249 kJ/mol. Wait, if O2 has a bond energy of around 498 kJ/mol, then the energy required to form O(g) from ½ O2 would be 249 kJ/mol. That matches the value here for O. Similarly, H is 218 kJ/mol. The bond energy of H2 is about 436 kJ/mol, so the energy to form H(g) from ½ H2 would be 218 kJ/mol. So maybe these energy values are the enthalpies required to form one mole of the substance from its elements in their standard states? Wait, but H is H(g), so the enthalpy of formation of H(g) is 218 kJ/mol, which is correct. Similarly for O(g). So perhaps the table lists the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance.\n\nWait, H2 is given as 0 kJ/mol, which is correct because it's the standard state. O2 is given as -136 kJ/mol? Wait, that can't be right. The standard enthalpy of formation for O2 is 0. So this must be something else. Maybe the energy values here are not enthalpies of formation. Alternatively, perhaps they are the bond energies? Let me think again.\n\nIf we consider the reaction HO(g) + HO(g) → H2O2(g), and we can calculate the bond energy of the O-O bond in H2O2 as 214 kJ/mol, then maybe we can use the energy values from the table to do that.\n\nLet me try to approach this. Let's assume that the energy values given in the table are the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance. For example, H2 has ΔHf° = 0, O2 is also 0, but in the table O2 is -136. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the energy values are the bond dissociation energies? Or maybe the energy required to form the molecule from its atoms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe these are the energies of the molecules relative to separated atoms. Let me think. For example, H2 has a bond energy of 436 kJ/mol (since it takes 436 kJ to break H2 into 2H). If the energy here is given as 0 for H2, maybe that's the energy of H2 relative to separated H atoms? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, if we consider the energy of H2 as 0, then perhaps the energy values are the enthalpy changes when forming the molecule from its atoms? For example, forming H2 from 2H would release energy, so the energy of H2 would be negative? But in the table, H2 is 0. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says \"relative energies of the following substances in the gaseous state\". Maybe they are the enthalpies of formation from the elements. For example, H2 is 0 because it's an element in standard state. O2 is 0 as well, but in the table O2 is -136. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe these are the energies required to break the molecule into its constituent atoms? For example, H2 would require 436 kJ/mol to break into 2H, but in the table it's 0. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy values are the enthalpy of atomization? For example, the energy required to break a molecule into its gaseous atoms. For H2, it's 436 kJ/mol, but the table says 0. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the energy values are the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°). Let me check for H2O. The table says -242 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(g) is indeed about -242 kJ/mol. So that matches. H2O2(g) is given as -136 kJ/mol. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O2(g) is approximately -136 kJ/mol? Let me recall. Actually, the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O2(l) is about -191 kJ/mol, and for the gas phase, it might be a bit different, but maybe in this problem it's given as -136. So if that's the case, then the table is listing the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance. Then H2 and O2 are 0, as they are elements in their standard states. But in the table, O2 is -136? Wait, no, looking back at the table:\n\nThe substances listed are O, H, HO, HOO, H2, O2, H2O2, H2O. The energy values are:\n\nO: 249, H: 218, HO: 39, HOO: 10, H2: 0, O2: -136, H2O2: -242, H2O: ?\n\nWait, O2 is listed as -136 kJ/mol? That contradicts the standard enthalpy of formation for O2, which is 0. So this must be a different kind of energy. Maybe the energy values are the bond dissociation energies? Let's check.\n\nFor O(g), if it's an oxygen atom, maybe the energy is the bond dissociation energy of O2? Wait, the bond dissociation energy of O2 is about 498 kJ/mol, so the energy required to form O(g) from ½ O2 would be 249 kJ/mol. Similarly for H(g), the bond dissociation energy of H2 is 436 kJ/mol, so forming H(g) from ½ H2 would be 218 kJ/mol. That matches the values given for O and H here. So perhaps the energy values in the table are the enthalpies required to form one mole of the substance from its elements in their standard states. For example, O(g) is formed from ½ O2(g), requiring 249 kJ/mol. Similarly for H(g). For HO(g), which is a hydroxyl radical, the energy is 39 kJ/mol. So maybe the energy here is the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance? For example, the ΔHf° of HO(g) is 39 kJ/mol? Let me check that. I don't remember the exact value, but let's proceed.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the reaction HO(g) + HO(g) → H2O2(g). The problem states that using this reaction, we can calculate the bond energy of the O-O bond in H2O2 as 214 kJ/mol. Let me try to do that calculation.\n\nFirst, the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH) would be equal to the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpies of the reactants. So:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf°(H2O2)] - 2 * [ΔHf°(HO)]\n\nFrom the table, ΔHf°(H2O2) is -242 kJ/mol, and ΔHf°(HO) is 39 kJ/mol.\n\nSo ΔH = (-242) - 2*(39) = -242 - 78 = -320 kJ/mol.\n\nBut this reaction is forming H2O2 from two HO radicals. In this process, what bonds are being formed or broken? Each HO radical has an O-H bond. In H2O2, there are two O-H bonds and one O-O bond. When two HO radicals combine, they form H2O2. So in terms of bonds, each HO has one O-H bond. When they combine, they form two O-H bonds and one O-O bond. Wait, but each HO has one O-H bond. So two HO radicals have two O-H bonds. When they combine into H2O2, the two O-H bonds remain, and an O-O bond is formed. Wait, but H2O2 has two O-H bonds and one O-O bond. So the reaction is forming one O-O bond. Therefore, the enthalpy change of the reaction is equal to the bond energy of O-O, because we are forming one O-O bond. Wait, but bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. So if forming a bond releases energy, then the bond energy would be positive if we are talking about the energy required to break it.\n\nSo the reaction forms one O-O bond. The enthalpy change (ΔH) is negative, meaning it's exothermic. So forming the O-O bond releases energy. Therefore, the bond energy (which is the energy required to break the bond) would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nLet me think again. If the reaction forms one mole of O-O bonds, then the enthalpy change of the reaction is equal to the negative of the bond energy of O-O. Because bond formation releases energy (negative ΔH), and bond breaking requires energy (positive ΔH). So if we have:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ (bond energies broken) - Σ (bond energies formed)\n\nIn this reaction, are any bonds being broken? The reactants are two HO radicals. Each HO is a radical, so they are already separated? Wait, no. Wait, HO is a molecule? Or is it a radical? Actually, HO is a hydroxyl radical, which has an unpaired electron. So when two hydroxyl radicals combine, they form H2O2. So in this case, no bonds are being broken, because the reactants are radicals. Instead, a bond is being formed between the two oxygen atoms. So the reaction is forming one O-O bond. Therefore, the enthalpy change of the reaction is equal to the negative of the bond energy of O-O. Because forming a bond releases energy equal to the bond energy. Therefore:\n\nΔH_reaction = - (bond energy of O-O)\n\nFrom earlier calculation, ΔH_reaction is -320 kJ/mol. Therefore:\n\n-320 kJ/mol = - (bond energy of O-O)\n\nTherefore, bond energy of O-O = 320 kJ/mol. But the problem says it's 214 kJ/mol. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So maybe my assumption is wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the bond energies in a different way. Let's think about the bond dissociation energy for the O-O bond in H2O2. The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break one mole of O-O bonds in H2O2. To calculate that, maybe we need to consider the reaction of breaking H2O2 into two HO radicals. Let me try that.\n\nReaction: H2O2(g) → 2 HO(g)\n\nThe ΔH for this reaction would be equal to the bond energy of O-O, since we are breaking one O-O bond. So:\n\nΔH = [2 * ΔHf°(HO)] - [ΔHf°(H2O2)]\n\nWhich is 2*(39) - (-242) = 78 + 242 = 320 kJ/mol. Therefore, the bond energy of O-O is 320 kJ/mol. But the problem states that it's 214 kJ/mol. There's a contradiction here. Which suggests that either my approach is wrong or there is a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the problem says that based on HO(g) + HO(g) → H2O2(g), it can be calculated that the bond energy is 214 kJ/mol. But according to my calculation, it's 320 kJ/mol. So why is there a difference?\n\nAh, maybe the energy values in the table are not the standard enthalpies of formation. Let me check again. If the energy values are not ΔHf°, but something else, like the energy required to form the molecule from separated atoms? For example, if the energy is given as the total bond dissociation energy. Let me think.\n\nFor example, let's take H2O. If the energy is given as -242 kJ/mol, perhaps it's the energy released when forming H2O from H and O atoms. So if you have 2 H atoms and one O atom combining to form H2O, the energy released is 242 kJ/mol, making the energy of H2O as -242. Similarly for other substances. Then, the energy of HO would be the energy released when forming HO from H and O atoms. If that's the case, then the energy values are the negative of the bond dissociation energies. For example, the bond dissociation energy of HO (O-H bond?) Wait, but HO is a radical. The bond dissociation energy would be the energy required to break the O-H bond in HO to form H and O atoms. If the energy of HO is 39 kJ/mol (as per the table), then maybe that's the energy released when forming HO from H and O atoms, so the bond energy (energy required to break it) would be +39 kJ/mol? That seems too low for an O-H bond. Normally, the O-H bond energy is around 460 kJ/mol. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy values are the total bond energies of the molecule. For example, H2 has a bond energy of 436 kJ/mol, so if the table says 0, that doesn't fit. I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the energy values in the table are the enthalpies of atomization? The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its gaseous atoms. For example, for H2, it's 436 kJ/mol. For O2, it's 498 kJ/mol. If the table is listing these values, then:\n\nFor H2: energy is 436 kJ/mol. But in the table, H2 is 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy values are the enthalpy changes when forming the molecule from its atoms. For example, forming H2 from 2H would release energy, so the energy would be negative of the bond energy. For H2, bond energy is 436 kJ/mol, so the energy of H2 would be -436 kJ/mol. But in the table, H2 is 0. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. The problem says that using the reaction HO(g) + HO(g) → H2O2(g), we can calculate the bond energy of O-O in H2O2 as 214 kJ/mol. Let's take that as a given and see if we can find out what the energy values in the table represent.\n\nLet me denote the energy values as E(substance). The reaction is 2 HO → H2O2. The bond energy of O-O is given as 214 kJ/mol. How can we relate this?\n\nAssuming that the energy values are the enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°), then:\n\nΔH_reaction = ΔHf°(H2O2) - 2 * ΔHf°(HO) = -242 - 2*(39) = -242 -78 = -320 kJ/mol.\n\nThis reaction forms one mole of H2O2 from two moles of HO. The bond energy of O-O is the energy required to break that bond. Since the reaction forms the O-O bond, the enthalpy change is the negative of the bond energy. Therefore:\n\nΔH_reaction = - (bond energy of O-O)\n\nSo bond energy = -ΔH_reaction = 320 kJ/mol. But the problem says it's 214 kJ/mol. There's a discrepancy here. This suggests that either the energy values are not ΔHf°, or there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy values in the table are the bond dissociation energies of the molecules? For example, the energy required to break the molecule into its constituent atoms. For example:\n\nFor H2, bond dissociation energy is 436 kJ/mol. But in the table, H2 is 0. Not matching.\n\nFor O2, bond dissociation energy is 498 kJ/mol. But in the table, O2 is -136. Doesn't match.\n\nFor H2O2, bond dissociation energy would be the energy required to break it into 2H and 2O? Or into HO and O? Wait, if we consider the bond dissociation energy of H2O2, it might involve multiple steps. For example, breaking H2O2 into 2 HO radicals would require energy equal to the bond energy of O-O, which is given as 214 kJ/mol. If that's the case, then the energy of H2O2 would be the energy required to break it into HO + HO minus the bond energy. Wait, maybe the energy values in the table are the energies of the molecules, and the bond energy can be calculated from them.\n\nLet me think again about the reaction HO + HO → H2O2. If the energy of HO is 39 kJ/mol and H2O2 is -242 kJ/mol, then the enthalpy change is -242 - 2*(39) = -320 kJ/mol. If this reaction forms one O-O bond, then the bond energy (energy released) is 320 kJ/mol. But the problem says it's 214 kJ/mol. So maybe the energy values in the table are not absolute but relative? Or perhaps there's a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy values are the energies of the molecules relative to the separated atoms. For example, if we consider the energy of separated atoms as zero, then the energy of a molecule would be negative of its bond energy. For example, H2 would have energy -436 kJ/mol, since forming it releases 436 kJ. But in the table, H2 is 0. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the energy values are the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°). Let me check for H2O. The ΔHf° of H2O(g) is indeed about -242 kJ/mol, which matches the table. For H2O2(g), the ΔHf° is given as -136 kJ/mol. Let me check actual values. The standard enthalpy of formation of H2O2(l) is about -191 kJ/mol. For the gas phase, it would be higher because vaporization requires energy. Let's assume for this problem it's -136 kJ/mol. Then, proceeding with that.\n\nIf the ΔHf° values are as given, then the calculation for the bond energy of O-O in H2O2 should be:\n\nΔH_reaction = ΔHf°(H2O2) - 2 * ΔHf°(HO) = -242 - 2*(39) = -320 kJ/mol.\n\nThis reaction forms one O-O bond. So the bond energy is the energy required to break that bond, which would be equal to the negative of ΔH_reaction, so 320 kJ/mol. But the problem states it's 214 kJ/mol. There's a contradiction here. This suggests that either the given bond energy is incorrect, or the energy values in the table are not ΔHf°. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the energy values in the table are not ΔHf° but something else, like the bond dissociation energies for specific bonds? For example, for HO(g), maybe the energy is the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond? Let's see. If HO is a hydroxyl radical, then breaking the O-H bond would require energy. If the energy of HO is 39 kJ/mol, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the energy values are the energies required to form the molecule from its atoms. For example, forming HO from H and O would release energy, so the energy of HO would be negative? But in the table it's positive 39. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy values are the enthalpies required to dissociate the molecule into its atoms. For example, the energy of HO is the energy required to break it into H and O, which would be the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond in HO. If that's the case, then the energy of HO is the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond. Similarly, the energy of H2 is the bond dissociation energy of H-H, which is 436 kJ/mol. But in the table, H2 is 0. Not matching.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to use the given bond energy of O-O in H2O2 (214 kJ/mol) to find out what the energy values in the table represent.\n\nLet's assume that the reaction HO + HO → H2O2 has a ΔH that can be calculated using bond energies. Normally, the enthalpy change can be calculated as:\n\nΔH = Σ (bond energies of reactants) - Σ (bond energies of products)\n\nIn this case, the reactants are two HO radicals. Each HO has an O-H bond. The products are H2O2, which has two O-H bonds and one O-O bond.\n\nWait, but if the reaction is forming H2O2 from two HO radicals, then we are breaking no bonds and forming one O-O bond. Wait, no. Wait, the HO radicals are already present; to form H2O2, we are forming one O-O bond. The O-H bonds remain intact. So the bond energies involved are only the O-O bond.\n\nBut how does that relate to the energy values in the table? If the energy values are the bond dissociation energies, then the energy of HO would be the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond. Let's denote:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nBond energy of O-H in HO = E(O-H) = let's say x kJ/mol\n\nBond energy of O-O in H2O2 = 214 kJ/mol (given)\n\nThen, the reaction HO + HO → H2O2 involves forming one O-O bond. So the ΔH for the reaction would be -bond energy of O-O = -214 kJ/mol.\n\nBut according to the energy values in the table, if we calculate ΔH using the energy values:\n\nΔH = Energy of H2O2 - 2 * Energy of HO = -242 - 2*(39) = -320 kJ/mol.\n\nSetting this equal to -214 kJ/mol gives -320 = -214, which is not possible. So there's inconsistency.\n\nThis suggests that the energy values in the table are not directly related to bond energies or standard enthalpies of formation in the way I thought. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy values in the table are the energies of the molecules relative to their separated atoms. For example, if we take the energy of separated atoms as zero, then the energy of a molecule would be negative of its total bond energy. For example, H2 would have energy -436 kJ/mol, since forming it releases 436 kJ. But in the table, H2 is 0. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the energy values are the energies of the molecules relative to the elements in their standard states. For example, the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°). For H2, it's 0, as it's an element in standard state. For O2, it's 0. But in the table, O2 is -136. That doesn't fit. Unless the table has a typo, but assuming it's correct, perhaps O2 is not in standard state here? Or maybe the table is listing something else.\n\nWait, the substances listed include O(g), H(g), HO(g), etc. These are not elements in their standard states. For example, O(g) is an oxygen atom, which has a standard enthalpy of formation of 249 kJ/mol (as it takes energy to break O2 into O atoms). Similarly for H(g). So if the energy values are ΔHf°, then:\n\nΔHf°(O(g)) = 249 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(H(g)) = 218 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(HO(g)) = 39 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(HOO(g)) = 10 kJ/mol\n\nΔHf°(H2) = 0\n\nΔHf°(O2) = 0\n\nΔHf°(H2O2) = -136 kJ/mol\n\nWait, but in the table, H2O2 is -242, and O2 is -136. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nThe table is:\n\nSubstance (g) | O | H | HO | HOO | H2 | O2 | H2O2 | H2O\n\nEnergy / kJ·mol⁻¹ | 249 | 218 | 39 | 10 | 0 | -136 | -242 | ?\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo in the table? For example, maybe H2O2 is -136 and H2O is -242? Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal table:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}\n\\hline Substance $(\\mathrm{g})$ & $\\mathrm{O}$ & $\\mathrm{H}$ & $\\mathrm{HO}$ & $\\mathrm{HOO}$ & $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ & $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ & $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ & $\\mathrm{H}_ }_ {2} \\mathrm{O}$ \\\\\n\\hline Energy $/ \\mathrm{kJ} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ & 249 & 218 & 39 & 10 & 0 & -136 & -242 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\\\end{tabular}\n\nWait, the last column is for H2O, but the energy is missing in the table? Or is it a formatting error? The original table has seven entries under Substance: O, H, HO, HOO, H2, O2, H2O2, and H2O. But the energy row has seven values: 249, 218, 39, 10, 0, -136, -242. Wait, that's seven values for eight substances. There's a missing value for H2O. Maybe it's a formatting error in the LaTeX. Let me check the LaTeX code again.\n\nThe LaTeX code for the table is:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}\n\\hline Substance $(\\mathrm{g})$ & $\\mathrm{O}$ & $\\mathrm{H}$ & $\\mathrm{HO}$ & $\\mathrm{HOO}$ & $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ & $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ & $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ & $\\mathrm{H}_ }_ {2} \\mathrm{O}$ \\\\\n\\hline Energy $/ \\mathrm{kJ} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ & 249 & 218 & 39 & 10 & 0 & -136 & -242 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\\\end{tabular}\n\nWait, there are seven columns in the tabular (since it's {l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}), but the substances are listed as eight, with the last one being H2O, but the energy row has only seven values. This is a formatting error. Probably, the last energy value for H2O is missing. Let me assume that H2O has an energy of -242 kJ/mol, but that's already assigned to H2O2. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and H2O is supposed to be -242, and H2O2 is -136. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Based on HO(g) + HO(g) = H2O2(g), it can be calculated that the bond energy of the oxygen-oxygen single bond in H2O2 is 214 kJ·mol⁻¹.\" Given that, and assuming the table is correct, let's focus on the given values.\n\nLet me proceed with the assumption that the energy values are the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°), despite the inconsistency with O2. Let's say O2 has ΔHf° of -136 kJ/mol, which is unusual, but maybe in this problem's context, it's given that way. Let's see if it makes sense.\n\nSo, using the reaction HO + HO → H2O2, and calculating the bond energy of O-O as 214 kJ/mol. Let's try again with the given ΔHf° values.\n\nΔH_reaction = ΔHf°(H2O2) - 2 * ΔHf°(HO) = -242 - 2*(39) = -242 - 78 = -320 kJ/mol.\n\nThis is the enthalpy change for the reaction. To relate this to bond energies, we need to consider what bonds are being formed or broken. In this reaction, two HO radicals are combining to form H2O2. Each HO has one O-H bond. In H2O2, there are two O-H bonds and one O-O bond. So, the reaction forms one O-O bond without breaking any bonds (since radicals are already present). Therefore, the enthalpy change should be equal to the negative of the bond energy of O-O. So:\n\nΔH = - (bond energy of O-O)\n\n-320 kJ/mol = - (bond energy of O-O)\n\n=> bond energy of O-O = 320 kJ/mol.\n\nBut the problem states it is 214 kJ/mol. This suggests that either the given bond energy is incorrect, or the energy values in the table are not ΔHf°. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the energy values are not ΔHf° but the bond dissociation energies of the molecules. For example, the energy required to dissociate the molecule into its constituent atoms. Let's try that.\n\nFor example, the energy of H2 is 0, which would mean it requires 0 energy to dissociate, which is wrong. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the energy values are the bond dissociation energies for specific bonds. For example, for HO(g), the energy is the bond dissociation energy of the O-H bond. Let's say:\n\nBond energy of O-H in HO = 39 kJ/mol (from table). But normally, the O-H bond energy is around 460 kJ/mol. This is way too low, so this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy values are the total bond energies of the molecules. For example, H2 has one bond with energy 436 kJ/mol, but in the table it's 0. Not matching.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Let me try to think differently. The problem says that using the reaction HO + HO → H2O2, the bond energy of O-O is 214 kJ/mol. Let's use this to find out what the energy values represent.\n\nLet's denote the energy values as E(substance). The reaction is 2 HO → H2O2. Let's assume that the energy change is E(H2O2) - 2*E(HO). This should be equal to the energy change associated with forming the O-O bond. If forming the O-O bond releases energy, then the energy change should be negative, and equal to the bond energy. So:\n\nE(H2O2) - 2*E(HO) = -bond energy of O-O\n\nFrom the problem, bond energy of O-O is 214 kJ/mol, so:\n\nE(H2O2) - 2*E(HO) = -214\n\nFrom the table, E(H2O2) is -242 and E(HO) is 39. Let's check:\n\n-242 - 2*39 = -242 - 78 = -320 ≠ -214. Not matching.\n\nThis suggests that either the table's values are incorrect, or there's another factor. Alternatively, maybe the energy values are the bond dissociation energies for the specific bond in the molecule. For example, in H2O2, the energy is the bond dissociation energy of the O-O bond, which is 214 kJ/mol. But in the table, H2O2 is -242. Not matching.\n\nWait, if the energy of H2O2 is the bond dissociation energy of O-O, then it should be positive 214, but in the table it's -242. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy values are the enthalpies of formation, and there's a calculation error in the problem statement. Let's say the correct bond energy is 320 kJ/mol, but the problem says 214. Maybe the options are based on the given bond energy of 214, and we have to use that to find out the correct answer, even if there's inconsistency.\n\nLet me proceed with that. Assume that the bond energy of O-O is 214 kJ/mol as given, and try to evaluate the options.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) The bond energy of H2 is 436 kJ·mol⁻¹.\n\n(B) The bond energy of O2 is greater than twice the bond energy of the oxygen-oxygen single bond in H2O2.\n\n(C) The energy required to dissociate the oxygen-oxygen single bond is as follows: HOO < H2O2.\n\n(D) H2O(g) + O(g) = H2O2(g) ΔH = -143 kJ·mol⁻¹.\n\nWe need to determine which statement is incorrect.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nFirst, let's recall that bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. For diatomic molecules, it's straightforward. For example, bond energy of H2 is the energy required to break H2 into 2H, which is 436 kJ/mol. So option A is likely correct, since standard bond energy of H2 is 436. So A is probably correct.\n\nOption B: Bond energy of O2 is greater than twice the bond energy of O-O in H2O2. Given that bond energy of O-O in H2O2 is 214, twice that is 428. If bond energy of O2 is greater than 428, then B is correct. The bond energy of O2 is actually about 498 kJ/mol, which is greater than 428, so B is correct. So B is likely correct.\n\nOption C: The energy required to dissociate the oxygen-oxygen single bond is as follows: HOO < H2O2. Wait, HOO is probably HO-O, like a hydroperoxy radical. The oxygen-oxygen bond in HOO (which is HO-O•) and in H2O2 (which is H-O-O-H). The bond energy in HOO might be different from that in H2O2. Generally, bond energies can vary depending on the molecular environment. If the bond energy in HOO is less than in H2O2, then the energy required to dissociate it (which is the bond energy) would be less, so HOO < H2O2. But is this true?\n\nIn H2O2, the O-O bond is between two -OH groups. In HOO (which is HO-O•), the O-O bond is between an -OH group and an oxygen atom. The bond energy in HOO might be different. In reality, the bond dissociation energy for the O-O bond in H2O2 is about 214 kJ/mol (as given). For the O-O bond in HO2 (HOO), the bond dissociation energy is actually higher, around 222 kJ/mol. Wait, but if the problem says that in the reaction HO + HO → H2O2, the bond energy is 214, and if HOO has a higher bond energy, then the energy required to dissociate the O-O bond would be higher, meaning HOO > H2O2, making option C incorrect. But I need to verify this with the given data.\n\nWait, the table lists HOO as 10 kJ/mol. What does this mean? If the energy values are related to bond dissociation energies, maybe the energy of HOO is the bond dissociation energy of the O-O bond in HOO. If so, then the bond energy of O-O in HOO is 10 kJ/mol, which is much less than 214 in H2O2. Then option C would be correct, since 10 < 214. But this seems unrealistic, as bond energies are usually in hundreds of kJ/mol. This suggests that the energy values in the table are not bond energies, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, if the energy of HOO is the energy required to dissociate the O-O bond, then it's 10 kJ/mol, which is very low. But this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the energy values are the standard enthalpies of formation, then the bond energy calculation earlier was conflicting.\n\nGiven the confusion, maybe I need to use the given data to evaluate option C. The statement is: \"The energy required to dissociate the oxygen-oxygen single bond is as follows: HOO < H2O2.\" If the energy required is the bond energy, and if in the table, the energy of HOO is 10 and H2O2 is -242, but these are not directly bond energies, it's hard to say. Perhaps there's another way.\n\nLet me think about the bond dissociation energy for the O-O bond in HOO and H2O2. For HOO (HO-O•), breaking the O-O bond would give HO• + O•. For H2O2, breaking the O-O bond gives 2 HO•. The bond energy for these processes would depend on the stability of the resulting radicals and the molecular environment.\n\nIf the bond energy in HOO is less than in H2O2, then option C is correct. To determine this, perhaps we can use the given data.\n\nLet me try to calculate the bond energy of O-O in HOO (HO-O•). Let's consider the reaction: HOO(g) → HO(g) + O(g). The bond energy here is the energy required to break the O-O bond in HOO.\n\nUsing the energy values from the table, if they are standard enthalpies of formation, then:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf°(HO) + ΔHf°(O)] - ΔHf°(HOO) = [39 + 249] - 10 = 278 - 10 = 268 kJ/mol.\n\nSo the bond energy of O-O in HOO is 268 kJ/mol.\n\nFor H2O2, we already calculated earlier that the bond energy is 214 kJ/mol (given by the problem). Wait, but according to the calculation using the given ΔHf° values, it should be 320 kJ/mol, but the problem says it's 214. This inconsistency is confusing, but let's go with the problem's given value of 214 for H2O2.\n\nIf the bond energy in HOO is 268 kJ/mol and in H2O2 is 214 kJ/mol, then the energy required to dissociate the O-O bond is higher for HOO than for H2O2. Therefore, HOO > H2O2, making option C incorrect, since it states HOO < H2O2. But this depends on the calculation above, which assumes the energy values are ΔHf°.\n\nWait, let's do this calculation properly. If the energy values are ΔHf°, then for the reaction HOO → HO + O, the ΔH is:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf°(HO) + ΔHf°(O)] - ΔHf°(HOO) = (39 + 249) - 10 = 278 - 10 = 268 kJ/mol. This is the energy required to break the O-O bond in HOO, so the bond energy is 268 kJ/mol.\n\nFor H2O2, the bond energy is given as 214 kJ/mol. So indeed, the bond energy in HOO (268) is greater than in H2O2 (214), so the energy required is HOO > H2O2, making option C incorrect. But the option C says HOO < H2O2, so option C is incorrect. However, the problem asks which statement is incorrect, so if C is incorrect, then C is the answer. But let's check other options to confirm.\n\nOption D: H2O(g) + O(g) → H2O2(g) ΔH = -143 kJ/mol. Let's calculate this using the energy values.\n\nAssuming the energy values are ΔHf°, then:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf°(H2O2)] - [ΔHf°(H2O) + ΔHf°(O)]\n\nBut we don't have ΔHf°(H2O) in the table. Wait, the table lists H2O but the energy is missing? Wait, in the original table, the last value is missing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal table:\n\nSubstance (g) | O | H | HO | HOO | H2 | O2 | H2O2 | H2O\n\nEnergy / kJ·mol⁻¹ | 249 | 218 | 39 | 10 | 0 | -136 | -242 | ?\n\nThe last value for H2O is missing. But in the problem statement, when they talk about option D, they mention H2O(g). Let's assume that the energy for H2O is -242 kJ/mol, as that's the value for H2O2. But that might not be correct. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(g) is about -242 kJ/mol, which matches the value for H2O2 in the table. That seems like a mistake, but let's proceed.\n\nAssume ΔHf°(H2O) = -242 kJ/mol (same as H2O2). Then, for the reaction H2O(g) + O(g) → H2O2(g):\n\nΔH = ΔHf°(H2O2) - [ΔHf°(H2O) + ΔHf°(O)] = (-242) - [(-242) + 249] = -242 - (-242 + 249) = -242 - (7) = -249 kJ/mol. But the option D says ΔH = -143 kJ/mol. This doesn't match. So this suggests that either the value for H2O is different, or there's a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, if the energy for H2O is something else. Let's denote the energy of H2O as E(H2O). Then:\n\nΔH = E(H2O2) - [E(H2O) + E(O)] = -242 - [E(H2O) + 249] = -242 - E(H2O) - 249 = -491 - E(H2O).\n\nOption D says ΔH = -143, so:\n\n-491 - E(H2O) = -143 => E(H2O) = -491 + 143 = -348 kJ/mol.\n\nBut the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(g) is about -242 kJ/mol, so this suggests that in the table, H2O has energy -348? That would be inconsistent. But since the table's H2O2 is -242, and H2O is likely -242, this suggests a problem. However, given that the problem provides the bond energy of O-O as 214 based on the given table, perhaps we need to use the given data to calculate.\n\nWait, let's try to find the correct ΔH for option D using bond energies. Let's assume that the bond energy of O-O in H2O2 is 214 kJ/mol. Let's consider the reaction H2O(g) + O(g) → H2O2(g).\n\nTo calculate ΔH, we can use bond energies. Let's break down the bonds in the reactants and products.\n\nReactants: H2O(g) and O(g). H2O has two O-H bonds. O(g) is an oxygen atom.\n\nProducts: H2O2(g), which has two O-H bonds and one O-O bond.\n\nTo calculate ΔH, we need to consider the bonds broken and formed.\n\nBonds broken: In H2O, we need to break one O-H bond to form H2O2. Wait, no. Let me think. The reaction is H2O + O → H2O2. Let me write the structures:\n\nH2O is H-O-H. Adding an O atom to form H2O2 (H-O-O-H). So, to form H2O2 from H2O and O, we need to break one O-H bond in H2O and form one O-O bond and one O-H bond. Wait, let's do a bond analysis.\n\nIn the reaction:\n\nH2O(g) + O(g) → H2O2(g)\n\nBonds broken: 1 O-H bond in H2O (since we are adding an O to one of the H's? Wait, no. Let me think of it as:\n\nH2O has two O-H bonds. To form H2O2, we need to add an O atom to one of the O atoms, forming an O-O bond and an O-H bond. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's use the bond energies approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the standard enthalpies of formation. If we can find the ΔHf° of H2O, we can calculate.\n\nAssuming the energy values in the table are ΔHf°, then for H2O(g), let's denote it as x. Then, for option D's reaction:\n\nΔH = ΔHf°(H2O2) - [ΔHf°(H2O) + ΔHf°(O)] = -242 - [x + 249] = -242 - x - 249 = -491 - x.\n\nIf option D says ΔH = -143, then:\n\n-491 - x = -143 => x = -491 + 143 = -348 kJ/mol.\n\nBut the standard ΔHf° of H2O(g) is about -242 kJ/mol, which suggests that in this table, H2O has an energy of -348, which is not standard. This indicates inconsistency, but perhaps in the context of this problem, we have to go with the given data. However, since the problem didn't provide the energy of H2O, maybe there's another way to calculate it using other given data.\n\nLet me try to find ΔHf°(H2O) using the bond energies. Let's consider the formation of H2O from its atoms. The reaction is 2H(g) + O(g) → H2O(g). The ΔH for this reaction is equal to the negative of the bond energy of the O-H bonds in H2O. Wait, H2O has two O-H bonds. Let's denote the bond energy of O-H as BE(O-H). Then:\n\nΔH = [2*BE(H) + BE(O)] - [2*BE(O-H)]\n\nWait, no. The standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(g) is the enthalpy change when forming H2O from H2 and O2. Let me recall the standard calculation.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(g) is calculated as:\n\nΔHf°(H2O) = Σ (bond energies of reactants) - Σ (bond energies of products)\n\nFor the reaction H2 + ½ O2 → H2O, the bonds broken are one H-H bond and half an O=O bond. The bonds formed are two O-H bonds.\n\nSo:\n\nΔHf°(H2O) = [BE(H-H) + ½ BE(O=O)] - 2 BE(O-H)\n\nAssuming standard bond energies: BE(H-H) = 436 kJ/mol, BE(O=O) = 498 kJ/mol, BE(O-H) = 463 kJ/mol.\n\nSo:\n\nΔHf°(H2O) = [436 + ½ * 498] - 2*463 = [436 + 249] - 926 = 685 - 926 = -241 kJ/mol, which matches the standard value of about -242 kJ/mol given in the table for H2O2. Wait, in the table, H2O2 is -242, but H2O is missing. This suggests that in the table, there might be a mistake, and H2O should be -242, while H2O2 is -136. But given the table as is, with H2O2 at -242, and H2O missing, it's hard to say. Let's assume that in the table, H2O is -242, and H2O2 is -136 (possibly a typo), then for option D:\n\nΔH = ΔHf°(H2O2) - [ΔHf°(H2O) + ΔHf°(O)] = (-136) - [(-242) + 249] = -136 - (-242 + 249) = -136 - 7 = -143 kJ/mol, which matches option D. This suggests that there was a typo in the table, and the values for H2O2 and H2O are swapped. Assuming this, then option D is correct.\n\nGiven this, let's revisit option C. If the bond energy in HOO is 268 kJ/mol and in H2O2 is 214 kJ/mol, then HOO > H2O2, making option C incorrect. But the problem says option C states HOO < H2O2, so C is incorrect. But let's confirm this calculation.\n\nUsing the table's values (assuming ΔHf°(HOO) = 10, ΔHf°(HO) = 39, ΔHf°(O) = 249):\n\nFor the reaction HOO → HO + O, ΔH = [39 + 249] - 10 = 278 - 10 = 268 kJ/mol. This is the bond energy of O-O in HOO, 268 kJ/mol. For H2O2, the bond energy is given as 214 kJ/mol. Therefore, the energy required to dissociate the O-O bond is higher in HOO than in H2O2, so option C is incorrect because it claims the opposite. Hence, option C is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's check the other options again. Option A says the bond energy of H2 is 436, which is correct. Option B says the bond energy of O2 is greater than twice the bond energy of O-O in H2O2 (2*214 = 428). The bond energy of O2 is typically 498 kJ/mol, which is greater than 428, so B is correct. Option D, with the assumed correction of H2O's energy, is correct. Therefore, the incorrect statement is option C.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other possibility. For example, if the bond energy of O-O in HOO is not 268, but something else. If the energy values in the table are not ΔHf°, but something else, like the bond dissociation energies for specific bonds, then our calculation might be wrong. However, given the problem's context and the need to use the given bond energy of 214 for H2O2, it's reasonable to proceed with the calculation based on ΔHf°.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is option C. But let me check the options again to make sure.\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) Correct.\n\n(B) Correct.\n\n(C) Incorrect.\n\n(D) Correct (with assumed correction).\n\nSo the answer is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem statement again for option C: \"The energy required to dissociate the oxygen-oxygen single bond is as follows: HOO < H2O2.\" If the energy required is the bond energy, and we calculated it as 268 for HOO and 214 for H2O2, then HOO > H2O2, so the statement is incorrect. Hence, option C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is option C.\n\nBut wait, let's also check option D again. If the table's H2O is -242 and H2O2 is -136 (assuming a typo), then the calculation for option D would be:\n\nΔH = -136 - [(-242) + 249] = -136 - (7) = -143, which matches option D. Hence, option D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
