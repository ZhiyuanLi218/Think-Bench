Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that molarity is calculated by dividing the number of moles of solute by the volume of the solution in liters. The formula is M = moles / liters. \n\nSo, I need to figure out how many moles of Ni(NO3)2 are in 30.0 grams. To do that, I need the molar mass of Ni(NO3)2. Let me calculate that. \n\nNickel (Ni) has an atomic mass of about 58.69 g/mol. Then, nitrate is NO3^- and there are two nitrate ions in the formula, right? Wait, the formula is Ni(NO3)2. So, there are two nitrate groups. \n\nSo, each nitrate is N and 3 O. The molar mass of NO3 is 14.01 (for N) + 3*(16.00) (for O) = 14.01 + 48.00 = 62.01 g/mol. Since there are two nitrate ions, multiply that by 2: 2*62.01 = 124.02 g/mol. Then add the molar mass of Ni: 58.69 + 124.02 = 182.71 g/mol. Wait, let me check that again. \n\nWait, Ni(NO3)2. So it's one Ni, two N, and six O. Let me recalculate:\n\nNi: 58.69 g/mol\n\nN: 14.01 g/mol * 2 = 28.02 g/mol\n\nO: 16.00 g/mol * 6 = 96.00 g/mol\n\nAdding those together: 58.69 + 28.02 + 96.00 = 182.71 g/mol. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the molar mass of Ni(NO3)2 is approximately 182.71 g/mol. \n\nNow, to find the number of moles in 30.0 grams: moles = mass / molar mass. So, 30.0 g / 182.71 g/mol. Let me compute that. \n\nLet me do the division. 30 divided by 182.71. Let me see. 182.71 goes into 30 how many times? Well, 182.71 * 0.16 is 29.23... so approximately 0.164 moles? Let me do a more precise calculation. \n\n30.0 / 182.71 ≈ 0.1642 moles. Let me check with a calculator. 30 divided by 182.71. Let me approximate 182.71 as 180 for estimation. 30/180 = 0.1667. But since 182.71 is a bit more than 180, the actual value will be a bit less than 0.1667. So maybe around 0.164 moles. \n\nBut let me do a better calculation. Let's see:\n\n182.71 * 0.164 = ?\n\nFirst, 182.71 * 0.1 = 18.271\n\n182.71 * 0.06 = 10.9626\n\n182.71 * 0.004 = 0.73084\n\nAdding those together: 18.271 + 10.9626 = 29.2336 + 0.73084 = 29.96444 grams. That's very close to 30.0 grams. So 0.164 moles is approximately 30.0 grams. So the number of moles is approximately 0.1642. \n\nBut let me do the exact calculation. Let's take 30.0 divided by 182.71. \n\nLet me write it as 30.0 / 182.71. Let me compute this division. \n\nFirst, 182.71 * 0.16 = 29.2336\n\nSubtract that from 30.0: 30.0 - 29.2336 = 0.7664\n\nNow, how much more is that? 0.7664 / 182.71 ≈ 0.00419. So total is 0.16 + 0.00419 ≈ 0.16419. So approximately 0.1642 moles. \n\nSo approximately 0.1642 moles of Ni(NO3)2. \n\nNow, the volume of the solution is 250 mL. I need to convert that to liters. 250 mL = 0.250 L. \n\nSo molarity is moles / liters = 0.1642 / 0.250. Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing 0.1642 by 0.25. Well, 0.25 is 1/4, so dividing by 1/4 is multiplying by 4. \n\n0.1642 * 4 = 0.6568 M. \n\nSo approximately 0.6568 molar. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option B is 0.656 mol/L. That seems to match. \n\nLet me check if my molar mass calculation was correct. Let me recalculate the molar mass of Ni(NO3)2. \n\nNickel: 58.69 g/mol\n\nNitrogen: 14.01 * 2 = 28.02 g/mol\n\nOxygen: 16.00 * 6 = 96.00 g/mol\n\nTotal: 58.69 + 28.02 + 96.00 = 182.71 g/mol. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the moles of Ni(NO3)2 is 30.0 / 182.71 = approx 0.1642 mol. \n\nThen, 0.1642 mol / 0.250 L = 0.6568 M. So the answer is approximately 0.656 M, which is option B. \n\nWait, let me check if there's any possible mistake here. Did I account for the correct number of nitrogens and oxygens? The formula is Ni(NO3)2. Each nitrate has one N and three O. Two nitrates would be 2 N and 6 O. So that's correct. \n\nAnother possible mistake could be in the molar mass of Ni. Let me check the atomic weight of Ni. The standard atomic weight of nickel is approximately 58.69 g/mol. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, the calculation seems right. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 0.656 mol/L.\n</think>"}
