Let me start by recalling what I know about geometric series. \n\nAn infinite geometric series has a sum if the common ratio r satisfies |r| < 1. The formula for the sum is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. \n\nThe problem says that the original series has a sum of 2005. So, according to the formula, that means:\n\n2005 = a / (1 - r) ... (1)\n\nThen, there's a new series obtained by squaring each term of the original series. The problem states that this new series has 10 times the sum of the original series, so its sum is 10 * 2005 = 20050. \n\nNow, let me think about what squaring each term of the original series does. If the original series is a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ..., then squaring each term gives a^2, a^2 r^2, a^2 r^4, a^2 r^6, ... So this is another geometric series, right? The first term is a^2, and the common ratio is r^2. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the new series should be S' = a^2 / (1 - r^2), provided that |r^2| < 1. Since |r| < 1 already, squaring it would still keep it less than 1, so that's okay. \n\nSo according to the problem:\n\n20050 = a^2 / (1 - r^2) ... (2)\n\nSo now I have two equations (1) and (2), with variables a and r. The problem asks for the common ratio of the original series, which is r, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n. \n\nSo I need to solve these two equations for r. Let me see how to do that. \n\nFrom equation (1), I can express a in terms of r:\n\na = 2005 * (1 - r) ... (3)\n\nNow substitute this into equation (2):\n\n20050 = [ (2005 * (1 - r))^2 ] / (1 - r^2 )\n\nLet me simplify that. First, note that 1 - r^2 factors as (1 - r)(1 + r). So:\n\n20050 = [ (2005^2 * (1 - r)^2 ) ] / [ (1 - r)(1 + r) ) ] = [ 2005^2 * (1 - r) ] / (1 + r )\n\nTherefore:\n\n20050 = [ 2005^2 * (1 - r) ] / (1 + r )\n\nLet me divide both sides by 2005 to simplify:\n\n20050 / 2005 = [ 2005 * (1 - r) ] / (1 + r )\n\nCalculating 20050 / 2005: Well, 2005 * 10 = 20050, so that simplifies to 10:\n\n10 = [ 2005 * (1 - r) ] / (1 + r )\n\nSo:\n\n10(1 + r) = 2005(1 - r)\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n10 + 10r = 2005 - 2005r\n\nNow, let me collect like terms. Bring all the terms with r to one side and constants to the other:\n\n10r + 2005r = 2005 - 10\n\nWhich is:\n\n2015r = 1995\n\nTherefore:\n\nr = 1995 / 2015\n\nNow, I need to simplify this fraction. Let's see if 1995 and 2015 have common factors. \n\nFirst, let's note that 2015 - 1995 = 20. So perhaps check if 5 is a common factor? \n\n1995 ÷ 5 = 399. 2015 ÷ 5 = 403. So:\n\nr = (399 / 403)\n\nNow check if 399 and 403 have any common factors. Let's check the difference: 403 - 399 = 4. So check if 4 divides into 399? 399 ÷ 4 is 99.75, no. Let's check GCD(399, 403). \n\nLet me factor 399. 399 ÷ 3 = 133. So 3 * 133. 133 is 7 * 19. So 399 = 3 * 7 * 19. \n\nNow factor 403. Let's try dividing by small primes. 403 ÷ 13 = 31. Because 13 * 31 is 403. Let me check 13*30=390, plus 13 is 403. Yes. So 403 = 13 * 31. \n\nLooking at the factors of 399: 3, 7, 19. Factors of 403: 13, 31. No common factors. Therefore, 399/403 is reduced. \n\nTherefore, m = 399, n = 403. So m + n = 399 + 403 = 802. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any errors. \n\nStarting from the two equations:\n\nOriginal sum S = a/(1 - r) = 2005.\n\nSquared series sum S' = a²/(1 - r²) = 20050.\n\nThen substituting a = 2005(1 - r) into the second equation gives:\n\n[2005²(1 - r)²]/(1 - r²) = 20050.\n\nWhich simplifies to [2005²(1 - r)]/(1 + r) = 20050.\n\nDividing both sides by 2005 gives [2005(1 - r)]/(1 + r) = 10.\n\nThen cross multiplying: 2005(1 - r) = 10(1 + r).\n\nExpanding both sides: 2005 - 2005r = 10 + 10r.\n\nBringing terms over: 2005 - 10 = 2005r + 10r => 1995 = 2015r => r = 1995/2015.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 5: 1995/5=399, 2015/5=403. Then check if 399 and 403 have common factors. As above, they don't. So m + n = 399 + 403 = 802. \n\nWait, but let me check if 399 and 403 have any common factors again. Maybe I missed something? Let me check GCD(399, 403). \n\nCompute GCD(403, 399). Using Euclidean algorithm:\n\nGCD(403, 399) = GCD(399, 403 - 399) = GCD(399, 4).\n\nThen GCD(399, 4). 399 divided by 4 is 99 with remainder 3. So GCD(4, 3). Then GCD(3, 1) = 1. So yes, GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction is reduced. \n\nSo m + n is 399 + 403 = 802. \n\nBut let me check if the answer is correct by plugging back into original equations. Let me check if with r = 399/403, and a = 2005*(1 - r), then the squared series sum is 20050.\n\nFirst compute 1 - r = 1 - 399/403 = (403 - 399)/403 = 4/403.\n\nTherefore, a = 2005 * (4/403). Let me compute that. \n\n2005 divided by 403. Let me see: 403 * 5 = 2015. But 2005 is 10 less than 2015, so 2005 = 403*5 - 10. Therefore, 2005 / 403 = 5 - 10/403. Therefore, a = 2005*(4/403) = 4*(5 - 10/403) = 20 - 40/403 = 20 - (40/403). \n\nBut maybe I don't need to compute a exactly. Let me check the second equation. \n\nThe squared series sum is a²/(1 - r²). Let's compute 1 - r². \n\n1 - r² = (1 - r)(1 + r) = (4/403)*(1 + 399/403) = (4/403)*( (403 + 399)/403 ) = (4/403)*(802/403) = 4*802 / (403^2). \n\nSo then the squared series sum is [a²]/[1 - r²] = [ (2005*(4/403))² ] / [4*802 / (403²) ] \n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: [2005² * 16 / 403²]\n\nDenominator: [4 * 802 / 403²]\n\nTherefore, dividing numerator by denominator:\n\n[2005² * 16 / 403²] / [4 * 802 / 403²] = [2005² * 16] / [4 * 802] \n\nSimplify:\n\n16 / 4 = 4, so:\n\n[2005² * 4 ] / 802 \n\nNote that 802 is 2 * 401. Wait, but 2005 is 5 * 401. Let me check:\n\nYes, 401 * 5 = 2005. Because 400*5=2000, plus 5 is 2005. \n\nSo 2005 = 5 * 401. Therefore, 2005² = 25 * 401². \n\nSo substituting:\n\n[25 * 401² * 4 ] / 802 \n\nBut 802 is 2 * 401. Therefore:\n\n[25 * 401² * 4 ] / (2 * 401) ) = [25 * 401 * 4 ] / 2 = 25 * 401 * 2 = 50 * 401 \n\nCompute 50 * 401. 400*50=20,000, plus 1*50=50, so total is 20,050. Which is 20050. \n\nYes! That's exactly the sum given for the squared series. Therefore, the calculations are correct. \n\nTherefore, the common ratio is 399/403, and m + n is 399 + 403 = 802. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's another possible solution. For example, could there be a negative common ratio? The problem didn't specify that r is positive, but if r is negative, then squaring it would make the ratio positive. However, since |r| < 1, regardless of sign, the series would converge. \n\nBut let's check if there's another solution with negative r. Let me see. \n\nSuppose r is negative. Let me go back to the equation:\n\nFrom 10(1 + r) = 2005(1 - r). \n\nIf r is negative, let me solve again:\n\n10(1 + r) = 2005(1 - r)\n\nWhich gives 10 + 10r = 2005 - 2005r\n\nThen 10r + 2005r = 2005 - 10\n\nWhich is 2015r = 1995 => r = 1995 / 2015 ≈ positive value. \n\nTherefore, even if we allowed r to be negative, the solution here is positive. So there are no negative solutions here. Therefore, the only solution is positive 399/403. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{802}\n</think>"}
