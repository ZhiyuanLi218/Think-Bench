So the question is about planetary oppositions and the orbital periods of the outer planets. The given data includes the orbital radii of Earth and the outer planets, and some opposition dates from 2014. We need to evaluate the four options (A to D) and see which ones are correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a planetary opposition is. From the description, when Earth is between the outer planet and the Sun, they're almost in a straight line. That means the planet is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, right? So this can only happen for outer planets (like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.) because inner planets like Venus and Mercury can't be in opposition since their orbits are inside Earth's orbit.\n\nNow, the key here is to relate the orbital periods of the planets to the frequency of their oppositions. Since the planets have different orbital periods, the time between their oppositions (as seen from Earth) will vary. Let me think about how to calculate the synodic period, which is the time between successive oppositions of a planet.\n\nThe formula for the synodic period (S) between two orbiting bodies is 1/S = 1/P - 1/Q, where P and Q are the orbital periods of the two bodies. But since we're dealing with Earth and an outer planet, we need to use the Earth's orbital period (1 year) and the planet's orbital period. Wait, actually, the formula is 1/S = |1/P - 1/Q|. For outer planets, since their orbital periods are longer than Earth's, the formula becomes 1/S = 1/P - 1/E, where E is Earth's orbital period (1 year), and P is the planet's orbital period.\n\nBut first, I need to find the orbital periods of each planet. The problem gives the orbital radii in AU. I remember from Kepler's third law that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² = a³, where P is in Earth years and a is in AU. So I can calculate each planet's orbital period using their given orbital radius.\n\nLet me calculate the orbital periods for each planet:\n\n- Earth: 1.0 AU. So P² = 1³ = 1 → P = 1 year. Correct.\n- Mars: 1.5 AU. P² = (1.5)^3 = 3.375 → P ≈ √3.375 ≈ 1.837 years. Let me check that calculation again. 1.5 cubed is 3.375, so square root of that is approximately 1.837. So Mars' orbital period is about 1.837 years.\n- Jupiter: 5.2 AU. P² = (5.2)^3 = 5.2 * 5.2 * 5.2. Let me compute that. 5.2 * 5.2 = 27.04. 27.04 * 5.2 ≈ 27.04 * 5 + 27.04 * 0.2 = 135.2 + 5.408 = 140.608. So P² ≈ 140.608 → P ≈ √140.608 ≈ 11.86 years. Which is correct for Jupiter.\n- Saturn: 9.5 AU. P² = 9.5³. Let me compute 9.5 * 9.5 = 90.25. 90.25 * 9.5. Let's do 90 * 9.5 = 855, and 0.25*9.5=2.375. So total is 855 + 2.375 = 857.375. So P² ≈ 857.375 → P ≈ √857.375 ≈ 29.28 years. Saturn's orbital period is about 29.46 years, so this is close enough for our purposes.\n- Uranus: 19 AU. P² = 19³ = 6859. So P ≈ √6859 ≈ 82.8 years. Uranus's actual orbital period is about 84 years, so again, close enough.\n- Neptune: 30 AU. P² = 30³ = 27000. So P ≈ √27000 ≈ 164.3 years. Neptune's actual period is about 164.8 years, so again, close.\n\nNow, the synodic period for each outer planet is given by 1/S = 1/E - 1/P, where E is 1 year (Earth's orbital period), and P is the planet's orbital period. Let me compute the synodic period for each planet.\n\nLet me start with Mars, even though it's an outer planet in this context? Wait, actually, Mars is an inner planet relative to Jupiter and others, but since Earth is between the Sun and Mars during opposition? Wait no, Mars is an outer planet here? Wait, the problem says \"outer planets\" as Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc. Wait, actually, Mars is an inner planet compared to Earth? Wait, no. Wait, in terms of the solar system, the inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. Then the outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. So Mars is actually an inner planet, but since Earth is between Mars and the Sun, that's possible? Wait, no. Wait, when Mars is in opposition, it's when Earth is between Mars and the Sun. So that can happen because Mars is an outer planet compared to Earth. Wait, no. Wait, actually, Mars is an outer planet compared to Earth. Because Earth is in the inner solar system, Mars is the next. So from Earth's perspective, Mars can be in opposition. So the problem is considering Mars as an outer planet here. So the given data includes Mars as an outer planet, which is a bit confusing because sometimes Mars is considered an inner planet, but in terms of oppositions, it's possible. So we need to calculate the synodic period for Mars as well.\n\nSo for each planet, let's compute the synodic period S.\n\nStarting with Mars:\n\nS = 1 / (1/E - 1/P) = 1 / (1/1 - 1/1.837). Let me compute 1/1.837 ≈ 0.544. So 1 - 0.544 = 0.456. So S ≈ 1 / 0.456 ≈ 2.19 years. So the synodic period for Mars is about 2.19 years, which is roughly 2 years and 2 months. So oppositions of Mars occur roughly every 26 months. So that's why Mars has oppositions about every 2 years.\n\nFor Jupiter:\n\nS = 1 / (1/1 - 1/11.86). Let's compute 1/11.86 ≈ 0.0843. So 1 - 0.0843 ≈ 0.9157. So S ≈ 1 / 0.9157 ≈ 1.092 years. Which is about 13 months. So Jupiter's opposition occurs roughly every 13 months. So in a year, there might be one or two oppositions? But since the synodic period is about 1.09 years, so roughly once every year, but not exactly. So over a year, maybe not exactly once.\n\nFor Saturn:\n\nS = 1 / (1/1 - 1/29.28). Let's compute 1/29.28 ≈ 0.03415. So 1 - 0.03415 ≈ 0.96585. So S ≈ 1 / 0.96585 ≈ 1.035 years. So about 1.035 years, which is roughly 12.4 months. So Saturn's opposition occurs roughly every 12.4 months. So about once a year.\n\nFor Uranus:\n\nS = 1 / (1/1 - 1/82.8). Let's compute 1/82.8 ≈ 0.01208. So 1 - 0.01208 ≈ 0.9879. So S ≈ 1 / 0.9879 ≈ 1.012 years. So about 1.012 years, which is roughly 12.1 months. So Uranus oppositions occur roughly every 12.1 months.\n\nFor Neptune:\n\nS = 1 / (1/1 - 1/164.3). Let's compute 1/164.3 ≈ 0.00608. So 1 - 0.00608 ≈ 0.9939. So S ≈ 1 / 0.9939 ≈ 1.006 years. So about 1.006 years, which is roughly 12.07 months. So Neptune's opposition occurs roughly every 12.07 months.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\nOption A: Each outer planet experiences opposition every year.\n\nWell, for each outer planet, the synodic period is less than a year? Wait, no. Let's check each:\n\nMars: S ≈ 2.19 years. So not every year.\n\nJupiter: S ≈ 1.09 years. So about every 13 months. So in a given year, there might be one opposition, but not necessarily every year. Wait, but if the synodic period is 1.09 years, then over a span of a year, the opposition occurs once every 1.09 years, so in some years, there might be two oppositions? For example, if the first opposition is in January, the next would be in February of the next year. Wait, no. Wait, if the synodic period is 1.09 years, then each opposition is about 13 months apart. So over a year, there's only one opposition per year. But the problem is whether \"every year\" means that in each calendar year, there is at least one opposition. For example, if an opposition occurs in January 2014, the next would be in February 2015, then March 2016, etc. So in each calendar year, there's one opposition. But if the synodic period is slightly less than a year, then maybe in some years there are two? Let's think.\n\nFor example, if the synodic period is 1.09 years, then over a year, the number of oppositions would be roughly 1 / 1.09 ≈ 0.917 per year, meaning that on average, there's about one opposition per year. But since the actual timing depends on the starting point, it's possible that in some years there are two, and in some years none. Wait, but if the synodic period is 1.09 years, then each opposition is about 13 months apart. So in a calendar year, there could be one opposition. For example, if the first opposition is in January 2014, the next would be in February 2015, then March 2016, etc. So each calendar year would have one opposition. But if the synodic period is exactly 1.09 years, then in some years, there might be two oppositions. For example, if an opposition occurs in November 2014, the next would be in December 2015, then January 2017. Wait, no. Wait, if it's 1.09 years, then 1.09 years after November 2014 would be November 2014 + 1 year and 0.09 years. 0.09 years is about 33 days. So November 2014 + 1 year is November 2015, plus 33 days is December 2015. So the next opposition is in December 2015. Then the next would be in January 2017. So in 2015, there's one opposition in December, and in 2016, none. So in some years there's one, in some years none. Therefore, it's not guaranteed that each outer planet has an opposition every year. So for Jupiter, with synodic period ~1.09 years, it's possible that in some years there's an opposition and in others not. Therefore, option A is incorrect because Mars, for example, has a synodic period of ~2.19 years, so it's not every year. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Jupiter is sure to be in opposition at some point in 2015.\n\nGiven that in 2014, Jupiter was in opposition on January 6. The synodic period of Jupiter is ~1.09 years. So adding 1.09 years to January 6, 2014 would be approximately January 6, 2015 + 0.09 years. Wait, let's compute the exact next opposition. If the synodic period is 1.09 years, then the next opposition after January 6, 2014 would be January 6, 2014 + 1.09 years. 1.09 years is 1 year and 0.09*365 ≈ 33 days. So January 6, 2014 + 1 year is January 6, 2015, plus 33 days is February 8, 2015. Therefore, the next opposition of Jupiter would be in early February 2015. Therefore, in 2015, Jupiter would be in opposition. So option B is correct. But wait, the question is whether it's \"sure to be in opposition at some point in 2015\". Since the next opposition after January 2014 is in February 2015, then yes, there is an opposition in 2015. So B is correct.\n\nOption C: The time interval between two consecutive oppositions of Uranus is half that of Saturn.\n\nLet's check the synodic periods. For Uranus, we calculated S ≈ 1.012 years (about 12.1 months). For Saturn, S ≈ 1.035 years (about 12.4 months). So the time interval between Uranus's oppositions is 1.012 years, and Saturn's is 1.035 years. The question is whether 1.012 is half of 1.035? No, 1.012 is not half of 1.035. In fact, 1.012 is approximately 0.98 times 1.035, so they are almost the same. So the interval for Uranus is slightly shorter than that of Saturn. But the statement in option C is that the interval for Uranus is half that of Saturn. Which is not true. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: Among the outer planets, the time interval between two consecutive oppositions of Neptune is the shortest.\n\nThe time interval between oppositions is the synodic period. For Neptune, the synodic period is ~1.006 years (about 12.07 months). For Uranus, ~1.012 years (12.1 months). For Saturn, ~1.035 years (12.4 months). For Jupiter, ~1.09 years (13 months). For Mars, ~2.19 years. So Neptune has the shortest synodic period among the outer planets. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nSo the correct options are B and D. Wait, but let me check again. The options are A, B, C, D. The problem says \"the following judgments are correct\" and the options are (A) to (D). So we need to choose which of the four options are correct.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\nA: Incorrect (since not all outer planets have opposition every year; Mars has it every ~2 years)\n\nB: Correct (Jupiter's next opposition after 2014 would be in 2015)\n\nC: Incorrect (Uranus's interval is not half of Saturn's)\n\nD: Correct (Neptune has the shortest synodic period among the outer planets)\n\nSo the correct options are B and D. But wait, the problem says \"the following judgments are correct\" and the options are labeled A to D. However, in the original question, the user says \"From A to D, we should choose\" but didn't specify how many options to choose. However, in the Chinese context, sometimes multiple-choice questions have multiple correct answers, but the options are labeled A to D, and you need to select all correct ones. However, in the problem statement here, the user hasn't specified whether it's multiple correct answers. However, in the original problem, since the user provided the options as (A) to (D), and the answer is to choose the correct ones, it's likely that the correct answer is B and D. However, looking back, the problem might be in Chinese where the options are single-select or multiple-select. But the way the problem is presented here, the user is asking to choose the correct options from A to D, and the answer is to be given as which letters.\n\nBut let me check again:\n\nOption D says Neptune has the shortest interval. Since Neptune's synodic period is the shortest (1.006 years), then D is correct. So options B and D are correct. However, the problem's given options may have different correct answers. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the opposition dates for 2014 are given for each planet. The question is whether the judgments are correct based on the orbital radii. The options are:\n\nA: Each outer planet experiences opposition every year. As we saw, for Mars it's every ~2.19 years, so no. For others, it's roughly once a year. But for example, Mars is not every year. So A is incorrect.\n\nB: Jupiter is sure to be in opposition in 2015. Given that the 2014 opposition was January 6, and the synodic period is ~1.09 years, the next would be in ~February 2015. So yes, there is an opposition in 2015. So B is correct.\n\nC: The time interval between Uranus's oppositions is half that of Saturn's. No, as their intervals are ~1.012 vs ~1.035, so no. C is incorrect.\n\nD: Neptune has the shortest interval. Yes, since Neptune's synodic period is the shortest among the outer planets. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. But the problem's options are A to D, and the user is to choose which ones are correct. However, in some cases, the options might be presented as single-choice, but the way the problem is phrased, it's possible that multiple options are correct. However, the original problem in Chinese might be a multiple-choice question where you select all that apply. But since the user is asking to provide the answer as \"From A to D, we should choose...\", and in the original problem's context, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, but according to our analysis, B and D are correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"the following judgments are correct\" and lists four options. In Chinese exams, sometimes there are multiple correct answers. However, the way the problem is presented here, the user might expect a single answer. But according to the analysis, both B and D are correct. However, looking back, the problem might have a different setup. Let me check the given data again.\n\nThe given data for 2014 oppositions includes Neptune on August 29. Let's verify Neptune's synodic period. Neptune's orbital radius is 30 AU, so P ≈ sqrt(30³) = sqrt(27000) ≈ 164.3 years. So synodic period is 1/(1 - 1/164.3) ≈ 1 / (153.3/164.3) ≈ 164.3 / 153.3 ≈ 1.072 years. Wait, wait, earlier calculation said 1.006 years. Wait, there's a mistake here. Let me recalculate the synodic period for Neptune.\n\nWait, earlier I had for Neptune:\n\n1/S = 1/E - 1/P = 1/1 - 1/164.3 ≈ 1 - 0.00608 ≈ 0.99392. Therefore, S ≈ 1 / 0.99392 ≈ 1.006 years. So approximately 1.006 years. So the synodic period is ~1.006 years, which is about 12.07 months. So Neptune's oppositions occur roughly every 12.07 months. Therefore, D is correct because Neptune has the shortest synodic period among the outer planets (since for Uranus it's ~1.012 years, Saturn ~1.035, Jupiter ~1.09, Mars ~2.19). So Neptune's is the shortest. Therefore D is correct.\n\nBut earlier when I thought about Neptune's synodic period, I thought it was ~1.006, which is correct. So D is correct.\n\nSo the correct options are B and D. However, looking back at the options given:\n\nThe problem says \"the following judgments are correct\" and the options are (A) to (D). In Chinese exams, sometimes the options are designed to have only one correct answer, but sometimes multiple. However, the way the problem is presented here, perhaps the correct answer is B and D. However, the original problem might have different options. But according to the analysis, B and D are correct.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The problem lists the options as (A) to (D), and the user is to choose the correct ones. The answer should be the letters corresponding to the correct options. However, in some cases, the options may have only one correct answer. Let me check if there's any mistake in my reasoning.\n\nFor option B: Jupiter's next opposition after January 6, 2014 would be in early 2015. Given that the synodic period is ~1.09 years, so adding 1.09 years to January 6, 2014:\n\n1 year is January 6, 2015. 0.09 years is 0.09*365 ≈ 33 days. So January 6 + 33 days is February 8, 2015. Therefore, the next opposition is in February 2015, which is within 2015. Therefore, B is correct.\n\nFor D: Neptune's synodic period is the shortest. Yes, because for Neptune, the synodic period is ~1.006 years, which is shorter than Uranus (1.012), Saturn (1.035), Jupiter (1.09), and Mars (2.19). So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. But the problem may have intended only one correct answer, but according to the calculations, both B and D are correct. However, looking back at the original problem statement, the options are labeled (A) to (D), and the user is to choose the correct ones. In Chinese exams, sometimes options are presented with multiple correct answers, and you need to select all that apply. However, in the absence of specific instructions, but given the way the problem is structured, I think B and D are correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other mistake. For example, in the calculation of the synodic period for Neptune, perhaps I made an error. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor Neptune, P = sqrt(30³) = sqrt(27000) ≈ 164.3 years.\n\nSynodic period S = 1 / (1/E - 1/P) = 1 / (1 - 1/164.3) ≈ 1 / (1 - 0.00608) ≈ 1 / 0.9939 ≈ 1.006 years. Correct.\n\nSo yes, Neptune's synodic period is ~1.006 years, which is the shortest among the outer planets. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and D. However, looking at the options again, the problem may have different correct answers. But according to the analysis, B and D are correct. But maybe the options are designed to have only one correct answer. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption B says Jupiter is sure to be in opposition in 2015. Given that the synodic period is ~1.09 years, and the 2014 opposition was in January, the next would be in February 2015, which is within 2015. Therefore, B is correct.\n\nOption D is correct.\n\nSo the correct options are B and D. But the original problem may have only one correct answer. However, based on the calculations, both B and D are correct. Therefore, the answer should be B and D. However, the way the question is presented in the problem, perhaps the options are meant to be single-select, but according to the analysis, both B and D are correct. Therefore, I think the correct answer is B and D. However, since the user hasn't specified whether multiple answers are allowed, but in the original problem's context, perhaps the intended answer is B and D. However, the problem might have a different intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the synodic period for Neptune. Let me check the formula again. The synodic period formula is 1/S = |1/E - 1/P|. Since for outer planets, P > E, so 1/E - 1/P is positive. Therefore, S = 1/(1/E - 1/P). For Neptune, E=1, P≈164.3, so S=1/(1 - 1/164.3)≈1.006 years. Correct. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and D. So the answer should be B and D. But the problem may have different options. However, in the original problem, the options are labeled (A) to (D), and the user is to choose the correct ones. Therefore, the correct answer is B and D.\n</think>"}
