A palindrome is something that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, either the three-letter part is a palindrome, or the three-digit part is a palindrome, or both. The question says that each arrangement is equally likely, so I can use probability rules here. The answer should be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then I have to find m + n. Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a palindrome is. For a three-character sequence, like letters or numbers, it's a palindrome if the first and third characters are the same. The middle character can be anything. For example, \"ABA\" is a palindrome because the first and third letters are both A, and \"121\" is a palindrome because the first and third digits are both 1. The middle character doesn't affect the palindrome property because it's in the center.\n\nSo, for the three-letter part, how many palindromic combinations are there? Let me think. The first letter can be any letter, the second letter can be any letter, and the third letter has to be the same as the first. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the number of three-letter palindromes would be 26 (choices for first letter) * 26 (choices for second letter) * 1 (third letter is determined by the first). So that's 26 * 26 = 676 three-letter palindromes.\n\nSimilarly, for the three-digit part, the first digit can be any digit from 0-9, the second digit can be any digit from 0-9, and the third digit must equal the first. So that's 10 * 10 = 100 three-digit palindromes.\n\nNow, the total number of possible three-letter combinations is 26^3, and the total number of three-digit combinations is 10^3. So, the total number of license plates is 26^3 * 10^3. But maybe I don't need that right away.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that there's at least one palindrome in either the letters or the digits. Hmm. When dealing with probabilities of \"at least one,\" it's often useful to use the complement rule. But here, since there are two separate parts (letters and digits), maybe I can calculate the probability that the letters are a palindrome, plus the probability that the digits are a palindrome, minus the probability that both are palindromes (because those cases are counted twice). That's the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nSo, probability of at least one palindrome = P(letters palindrome) + P(digits palindrome) - P(both letters and digits palindrome).\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst, P(letters palindrome). As I calculated earlier, there are 26*26 palindromic three-letter combinations. The total number of three-letter combinations is 26^3. So, P(letters palindrome) = (26^2)/26^3 = 1/26.\n\nSimilarly, P(digits palindrome) = 10^2 / 10^3 = 1/10.\n\nThen, P(both letters and digits palindrome) would be the product of the two probabilities, since the letters and digits are independent. So that's (1/26) * (1/10) = 1/260.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 1/26 + 1/10 - 1/260. Let me compute that. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, 26 and 10 have a least common multiple of 130. Let me convert each fraction:\n\n1/26 = 5/130\n\n1/10 = 13/130\n\nSo adding them: 5/130 + 13/130 = 18/130. Then subtract 1/260. Wait, but 1/260 is half of 1/130. Let me convert 18/130 to 36/260, so 36/260 - 1/260 = 35/260. Then simplify 35/260. Both divide by 5: 7/52. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the conversion.\n\nOriginal calculation:\n\nP = 1/26 + 1/10 - 1/260.\n\nConvert all to 260 denominator:\n\n1/26 = 10/260,\n\n1/10 = 26/260,\n\n1/260 = 1/260.\n\nSo total probability is 10/260 + 26/260 - 1/260 = (10 + 26 - 1)/260 = 35/260. Then simplifying 35/260. Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 7/52. Yes, same as before. 7 and 52 share no common factors (since 52 is 13*4, and 7 is prime). So 7/52 is reduced. Therefore, the probability is 7/52. Therefore, m is 7, n is 52, so m + n is 59? Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if this is correct.\n\nBut hold on, I need to make sure that my calculations for the number of palindromes are correct. For the letters: three letters, first and third must be same. So number of palindromes is 26*26, as I said. Total number of three-letter combinations is 26^3. So probability is 26^2 / 26^3 = 1/26. That seems correct. Similarly for digits: 10*10 / 10^3 = 1/10. Correct. Then, since the two events (palindromic letters and palindromic digits) are independent, the probability that both happen is 1/26 * 1/10 = 1/260. So inclusion-exclusion gives 1/26 + 1/10 - 1/260 = 7/52 ≈ 0.1346... So the probability is 7/52. Therefore, m + n is 7 + 52 = 59. But wait, before I conclude, let me check if I didn't make any mistake in the inclusion-exclusion step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the probability by calculating 1 - P(no palindromes). Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nSo, P(at least one palindrome) = 1 - P(no palindromes on letters and no palindromes on digits).\n\nSo, P(no palindromes) = P(letters not palindrome) * P(digits not palindrome).\n\nSo, first compute P(letters not palindrome). Total letters: 26^3. Number of non-palindromic letters: total minus palindromic, so 26^3 - 26^2. Similarly for digits: 10^3 - 10^2. Therefore, P(no palindromes) is [(26^3 - 26^2)/26^3] * [(10^3 - 10^2)/10^3]. Then 1 minus that would be the desired probability.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute [(26^3 - 26^2)/26^3] = 1 - (26^2)/26^3 = 1 - 1/26 = 25/26.\n\nSimilarly for digits: 1 - 1/10 = 9/10.\n\nTherefore, P(no palindromes) = (25/26)*(9/10) = (225)/260.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one palindrome) = 1 - 225/260 = (260 - 225)/260 = 35/260 = 7/52. Same result as before. So that's reassuring. Therefore, the probability is indeed 7/52. So m is 7, n is 52. Are they coprime? 52 factors into 2*2*13. 7 is prime, doesn't divide into 52. So yes, 7 and 52 are coprime. Therefore, m + n = 59.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"the probability that such a license plate will contain at least one palindrome (a three-letter arrangement or a three-digit arrangement that reads the same left-to-right as it does right-to-left)\". So, is there any possibility that I have miscalculated the number of palindromes? Let me check again.\n\nFor three-letter palindromes: first and third letters must be the same. So, the number is 26 choices for first letter, 26 for second, 1 for third. So 26*26. Total number of three-letter combinations is 26*26*26, so the probability is 26*26 / 26^3 = 1/26. Correct.\n\nSame with digits: 10*10 / 10^3 = 1/10. Correct.\n\nTherefore, calculations are correct. So the answer is 7/52, so 7 + 52 is 59. Therefore, the answer is 59.\n\nBut wait, I just want to check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and perhaps make a mistake. For example, maybe someone might think that a three-digit palindrome is something different? Let me check.\n\nA three-digit palindrome is a number like 121, where the first and third digits are the same. The middle digit can be anything. So, for digits, first digit: 1-9? Wait, hold on! Wait, license plates can have digits from 0-9, right? So the first digit can be 0? For example, a license plate could be AAA-000, right? So, digits can be 000 to 999. Therefore, the first digit can be 0. So, the number of three-digit palindromes is 10*10 = 100, as I calculated before. So that is correct.\n\nSimilarly, letters: there's no restriction on letters, they can be any letters, so 26 choices for each letter. So, palindromes are 26*26. Correct.\n\nTherefore, calculations are correct. So the answer is 7/52, so 7 + 52 = 59. Therefore, the answer is 59.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with actual numbers. Let's take a smaller case. Suppose instead of 26 letters and 10 digits, we have 2 letters and 2 digits, and compute the probability. Maybe that can help verify.\n\nLet me try with letters being A and B (2 letters) and digits 0 and 1 (2 digits). Then, total license plates: (2^3)*(2^3) = 8*8=64.\n\nNumber of three-letter palindromes: first and third letters same. For letters: 2 choices for first, 2 for middle, 1 for third: total 2*2=4. Similarly for digits: 2*2=4. Probability letters palindrome: 4/8=1/2. Probability digits palindrome: 4/8=1/2. Probability both: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. Then probability at least one palindrome is 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/4 = 3/4. Alternatively, 1 - P(no palindrome). P(no palindrome) is (1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/2) = 1/2*1/2=1/4. So 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. Let's count manually.\n\nTotal license plates: 64. Number with at least one palindrome. Let's compute.\n\nNumber with letters palindrome: 4*8=32. Number with digits palindrome: 8*4=32. But overlap is 4*4=16. So total unique plates with at least one palindrome: 32 + 32 - 16 = 48. So probability is 48/64 = 3/4. Which matches. So 3/4 is correct. So in this case, the formula works. So in the original problem, the same formula works, giving 7/52. Therefore, seems correct. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 59.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{59}\n</think>"}
