The Earth's radius is given as 6400 km. The options are A through D, with A being 4.9 m/s², B 8.9, C 9.8, and D 10.8. \n\nFirst, I remember that the acceleration due to gravity decreases with altitude. On the surface, it's about 9.8 m/s², so if the shuttle is in orbit higher up, the gravity should be less than that. So that might eliminate option C and D, maybe? But I need to calculate it properly.\n\nThe formula for gravitational acceleration at a distance r from the center of the Earth is g = GM / r², where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the Earth. But I don't remember the exact values for G and M. Wait, maybe there's another way using the known value of g at the Earth's surface?\n\nYes, I think there's a way to relate the acceleration at the surface to the acceleration at altitude. The surface gravity is g₀ = 9.8 m/s², and that's at a distance of R from the center, where R is the Earth's radius. When you go up to an altitude h above the surface, the distance from the center becomes R + h. So the acceleration at that altitude would be g = g₀ * (R / (R + h))². \n\nLet me check if that formula makes sense. Since R + h is larger than R, the denominator is larger, so the whole term (R / (R + h))² is less than 1, so g is less than g₀, which matches what I thought earlier. That seems right.\n\nSo given that, let me plug in the numbers. The Earth's radius R is 6400 km, and the altitude h is 300 km. So the distance from the center is 6400 + 300 = 6700 km. \n\nNow I need to compute (R / (R + h))². Let me convert those to the same units, but since they are both in km, the units will cancel out. So R/(R+h) is 6400 / 6700. Let me compute that ratio first. \n\n6400 divided by 6700. Let me do the division. Let's see, 6400 / 6700. Well, both numbers can be divided by 100 to make it 64 / 67. Let me compute that. 64 divided by 67. Hmm, 67 goes into 64 zero times. Add a decimal: 64.0 divided by 67. \n\nWell, 67*0.9 is 60.3. Subtract that from 64, we get 3.7. Bring down a zero: 37.0. 67 goes into 37 zero times. Next decimal place. 67*0.05 is 3.35. Subtract that from 37, we get 33.65. Bring down another zero: 336.5. 67*5 is 335. So that's 0.95... So approximately 0.955? Wait, let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe approximate fractions. 64/67 is approximately... Let's see, 67 is approximately 66.666... which is 2/3 of 100. Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, think of it as (64/67) ≈ (64/64 + 3) ≈ 1 / (1 + 3/64) ≈ 1 / (1 + 0.046875) ≈ using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x. So that would be approximately 1 - 0.046875 = 0.9531. So approximately 0.953. Therefore, squaring that would be (0.953)^2. Let me compute that. \n\n0.95 squared is 0.9025. 0.95^2 = 0.9025. But 0.953 is a bit more. Let me do (0.95 + 0.003)^2 = 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.003 + 0.003² = 0.9025 + 0.0057 + 0.000009 ≈ 0.9082. So approximately 0.908. \n\nTherefore, the acceleration g is 9.8 m/s² multiplied by 0.908. Let me calculate that. 9.8 * 0.908. Let's do 10 * 0.908 = 9.08, minus 0.2 * 0.908 = 0.1816. So 9.08 - 0.1816 = 8.8984 m/s². So approximately 8.9 m/s². Which is option B. \n\nBut let me check if my approximations are correct. Maybe I made an error in estimating 64/67. Let me do a more precise calculation. \n\nCompute 6400 / 6700. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 100: 64 / 67. Let me compute this division more accurately. \n\n64 ÷ 67:\n\n67 goes into 64 zero times. Add decimal: 64.000...\n\n67 into 640 (tenths place): 67*9=603, 67*9=603. Subtract 603 from 640: 37. Bring down next 0: 370.\n\n67 into 370: 67*5=335. Subtract 335 from 370: 35. Bring down 0: 350.\n\n67 into 350: 67*5=335 again. Subtract: 15. Bring down 0: 150.\n\n67 into 150: 2 times (134). Subtract: 16. Bring down 0: 160.\n\n67 into 160: 2 times (134). Subtract: 26. Bring down 0: 260.\n\n67 into 260: 3 times (201). Subtract: 59. Bring down 0: 590.\n\n67 into 590: 8 times (536). Subtract: 54. \n\nSo putting this all together, we have 0.9552... So approximately 0.9552. \n\nTherefore, (R/(R+h))² = (0.9552)^2. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\nFirst, 0.95^2 = 0.9025. Now, 0.9552 is 0.95 + 0.0052. Let me use the expansion (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² where a = 0.95 and b = 0.0052.\n\nSo, a² = 0.9025\n\n2ab = 2 * 0.95 * 0.0052 = 1.9 * 0.0052 ≈ 0.00988\n\nb² = (0.0052)^2 ≈ 0.000027\n\nAdding them together: 0.9025 + 0.00988 + 0.000027 ≈ 0.9124. \n\nWait, but that's if we take a as 0.95 and b as 0.0052. But actually, 0.95 + 0.0052 is 0.9552. However, perhaps a better way is to square 0.9552 directly. Let me do that step by step.\n\nMultiply 0.9552 × 0.9552:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.95 × 0.95 = 0.9025\n\nThen, 0.95 × 0.0052 = 0.00494\n\nThen, 0.0052 × 0.95 = 0.00494\n\nThen, 0.0052 × 0.0052 = 0.00002704\n\nAdding all these together: 0.9025 + 0.00494 + 0.00494 + 0.00002704 ≈ 0.9025 + 0.00988 + 0.000027 ≈ 0.9124. \n\nWait, but that's the same as before. However, actually, when you multiply (a + b)(a + b) where a = 0.95 and b = 0.0052, it's a² + 2ab + b². So that gives 0.9124. Therefore, the square is approximately 0.9124. \n\nTherefore, the acceleration is 9.8 m/s² * 0.9124 ≈ ?\n\nCalculating 9.8 * 0.9124. Let me do this multiplication:\n\nFirst, 10 * 0.9124 = 9.124\n\nSubtract 0.2 * 0.9124 = 0.18248\n\nSo, 9.124 - 0.18248 = 8.9415 m/s². \n\nSo approximately 8.94 m/s². Which is very close to 8.9 m/s², which is option B. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way to calculate this. Maybe using exact fractions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the exact formula with the actual numbers. Let me recall that the gravitational acceleration at distance r is given by g = g₀ * (R² / r²), where R is Earth's radius and r is the distance from the center. So, g = 9.8 * (6400² / (6400 + 300)²) = 9.8 * (6400² / 6700²). \n\nAlternatively, compute 6400 / 6700 first, which is 64/67 ≈ 0.95522 as above. Squared is ≈ 0.9124. So 9.8 * 0.9124 ≈ 8.94 m/s². So approximately 8.9 m/s². \n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. Maybe I can compute 6400 / 6700. Let me convert them to meters? Wait, no, since we are taking a ratio, units cancel. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use more accurate calculation for (64/67)^2. \n\nLet me compute 64 squared and 67 squared. \n\n64² = 4096\n\n67² = 4489\n\nTherefore, (64/67)² = 4096 / 4489 ≈ Let me compute that division. \n\nWhat is 4096 divided by 4489? Let me approximate. \n\nWell, 4489 × 0.9 = 4040.1 \n\nSubtract that from 4096: 4096 - 4040.1 = 55.9 \n\nSo 0.9 + (55.9 / 4489). \n\nCompute 55.9 / 4489 ≈ 0.01245 \n\nTherefore, total is approximately 0.9 + 0.01245 ≈ 0.91245 \n\nTherefore, (64/67)² ≈ 0.91245 \n\nSo multiplying by 9.8 m/s² gives 9.8 * 0.91245 ≈ ?\n\nAgain, 9.8 * 0.91245. Let me compute this:\n\nFirst, 9 * 0.91245 = 8.21205\n\nThen 0.8 * 0.91245 = 0.72996\n\nAdding those together: 8.21205 + 0.72996 ≈ 8.94201 m/s². \n\nSo approximately 8.94 m/s². Which is very close to 8.9 m/s². So the answer is B: 8.9 m/s². \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, does the Earth's rotation affect this? Probably not, since we are talking about the acceleration due to gravity, which is the gravitational acceleration minus the centrifugal acceleration due to the rotation. However, in most basic physics problems, especially when comparing to the standard gravity of 9.8 m/s², the centrifugal effect is neglected. Also, the Space Shuttle's orbital speed would contribute to the centripetal acceleration, but in this question, they are specifically asking for the acceleration due to Earth's gravity experienced by the shuttle. Wait, actually, when in orbit, the shuttle is in free fall, so the net acceleration is the centripetal acceleration required for the orbit, which is provided by gravity. So in that sense, the acceleration due to gravity is the same as the centripetal acceleration. \n\nBut maybe the question is just asking for the gravitational acceleration at that altitude, not considering the orbital motion. However, since the formula we used is for gravitational acceleration at a distance r from Earth's center, regardless of the object's motion, so our calculation should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using a simplified approach. For example, if we approximate R as 6400 km, and h as 300 km, so the ratio is 6400/(6400+300) = 64/67 ≈ 0.955, squared is ≈ 0.912, times 9.8 is ≈ 8.94. So 8.9 m/s². \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard formula or known value. I remember that the International Space Station orbits at about 400 km altitude and experiences about 8.7 m/s², so 300 km should be a bit higher, like 8.9. So that matches with option B. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: 8.9 m/s².\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
