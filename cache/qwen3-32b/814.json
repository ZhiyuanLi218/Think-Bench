I need to figure out the pressure difference between two points in a horizontal pipe where the diameter changes. The fluid is incompressible, has negligible viscosity, and the flow is streamlined with constant flow rate. So, I remember something about Bernoulli's equation here. But let me start from the beginning.\n\nFirst, since the pipe is horizontal, the elevation is the same at both points, so the gravitational potential energy terms in Bernoulli's equation will cancel out. That simplifies things. Bernoulli's equation is usually written as P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant. Since h is the same at both points, we can ignore the ρgh terms. So, the equation becomes P1 + ½ρv1² = P2 + ½ρv2². Therefore, the pressure difference P1 - P2 would be ½ρ(v2² - v1²). Wait, no, let me rearrange that properly. If P1 + ½ρv1² = P2 + ½ρv2², then P2 = P1 + ½ρ(v1² - v2²). So, the pressure at point 2 depends on the difference in the squares of the velocities multiplied by ½ρ.\n\nBut first, I need to find the velocities at both points. The problem says that the diameter at point 1 is d, and at point 2 is d/3. The flow is streamlined with constant flow rate. So, the volume flow rate Q must be the same at both points. The volume flow rate is given by Q = A*v, where A is the cross-sectional area and v is the flow speed. Since Q is constant, A1*v1 = A2*v2.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of a pipe is πr², and since diameter is given, radius is d/2. So, A1 = π*(d/2)² = πd²/4. Similarly, A2 = π*(d/6)² = πd²/36, because the diameter at point 2 is d/3, so radius is (d/3)/2 = d/6.\n\nSo, A1*v1 = A2*v2. Plugging in the areas:\n\n(πd²/4)*v1 = (πd²/36)*v2\n\nWe can cancel out πd² from both sides:\n\n(1/4)*v1 = (1/36)*v2\n\nMultiply both sides by 36 to solve for v2:\n\n(36/4)*v1 = v2 => 9*v1 = v2\n\nSo, the velocity at point 2 is 9 times the velocity at point 1. That makes sense because if the diameter is smaller, the velocity has to increase to maintain the flow rate, and since area depends on the square of diameter, reducing diameter by a factor of 3 reduces the area by 9, so velocity increases by 9.\n\nNow, going back to Bernoulli's equation. The pressure at point 2 compared to point 1 is:\n\nP2 = P1 + ½ρ(v1² - v2²)\n\nBut since v2 is 9v1, substitute that in:\n\nP2 = P1 + ½ρ(v1² - (9v1)²) = P1 + ½ρ(v1² - 81v1²) = P1 + ½ρ(-80v1²) = P1 - 40ρv1²\n\nTherefore, the pressure at point 2 is less than the pressure at point 1 by 40ρv1². So, looking at the options, option B says \"less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 ρv²\", which matches this result. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me check again. The question says \"the pressure at Point 2 is...\" So according to the calculation, P2 = P1 - 40ρv², so P2 is less than P1 by 40ρv². The options are in terms of ρv², so assuming that the velocity mentioned in the options is v, which is the velocity at point 1 (V). The problem says at point 1, the flow speed is V. So in the options, they probably mean V as in the original velocity. So yes, the difference is 40ρV². Therefore, answer B is correct.\n\nBut let me verify once more. The area ratio is (d/2)^2 / (d/6)^2 = (1/2)^2 / (1/6)^2 = (1/4)/(1/36) = 9. So A1/A2 = 9. Since Q is constant, A1V1 = A2V2 => V2 = V1*(A1/A2) = 9V1. So that part is correct. Then Bernoulli's equation gives pressure difference as ½ρ(V2² - V1²) difference? Wait, hold on. Wait earlier I had P2 = P1 + ½ρ(v1² - v2²). Therefore, P1 - P2 = ½ρ(v2² - v1²). So the difference in pressure between point 1 and 2 is ½ρ(v2² - v1²). Since v2 is 9v1, that becomes ½ρ(81v1² - v1²) = ½ρ(80v1²) = 40ρv1². So yes, P1 - P2 = 40ρv1², so P2 is less than P1 by 40ρv1². Therefore, answer B is correct. The options use \"ρv²\", so assuming that \"v\" here refers to the original speed V at point 1. So answer B: less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40ρv². Yep, that's what we found. So I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
