One is 100 kg, the other 50 kg. The heavier person pushes the lighter one with a force F. The question is asking which of the options A to D is correct regarding the forces and accelerations involved. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember Newton's third law. When one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. So if the heavier person pushes the lighter one with force F, the lighter person must push back on the heavier person with a force of -F (negative indicating opposite direction). That seems straightforward. So looking at the options, A says the force felt by the heavier person is (-1/2)F. But according to Newton's third law, it should be -F, right? So A is incorrect. Then option B says the force felt by the person is -2F. That also doesn't make sense because it should be equal and opposite. So B is also wrong. Wait, maybe the question is worded differently. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says \"the force felt by the heavier person\" in option A. So the heavier person applies F on the lighter one, and the lighter one applies -F on the heavier person. Therefore, the force felt by the heavier person is -F. But none of the options A or B are -F. So maybe I need to check if I misread the options. Let me see: A says (-1/2)F, B says -2F. Neither is -F. So maybe the problem is not about the force but about the acceleration? Wait, the options C and D are about acceleration. So perhaps I need to analyze the accelerations.\n\nLet me start over. The key here is Newton's third law for the forces and Newton's second law for the accelerations.\n\nSo, when the heavier person (mass M = 100 kg) pushes the lighter person (mass m = 50 kg) with a force F, the lighter person experiences a force F in the direction of the push. According to Newton's third law, the lighter person exerts a force -F on the heavier person. So both experience forces of magnitude F, but in opposite directions.\n\nNow, acceleration is force divided by mass. So for the lighter person, acceleration a_light = F / m = F / 50 kg. For the heavier person, acceleration a_heavy = F / M = F / 100 kg. Wait, but the force on the heavier person is -F, so the acceleration would be -F / M, but the question is about magnitude. So the magnitude of acceleration for the lighter person is F/50, and for the heavier person is F/100. Comparing the two, the lighter person's acceleration is twice that of the heavier person. Because F/50 divided by F/100 is 2. Therefore, the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person is twice that of the heavier person. So looking at options C and D, C says half, D says twice. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is D. Let me check again the options. The options are:\n\nA: (-1/2)F force on heavier person – incorrect, should be -F.\n\nB: -2F – also incorrect.\n\nC: acceleration of lighter is half – no, it's double.\n\nD: acceleration of lighter is twice – yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't any trick here. The question says \"the heavier person pushes on the lighter one with a force F\". So the force applied by the heavier person is F. Then the lighter person applies -F on the heavier. So accelerations are a = F/m for each. So lighter person's acceleration is F/50, heavier is F/100. So lighter's acceleration is twice as much. So D is correct. So the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if the options are referring to the accelerations' magnitudes. Yes, option C says \"the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person\". Which is opposite of what we found. So D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Let me check again if I made any mistake in the calculation. For the lighter person, acceleration is F divided by 50. For the heavier, it's F divided by 100. So F/50 divided by F/100 is 2. So lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's. Therefore, D is correct. Yes.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
