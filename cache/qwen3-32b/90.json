Let me start by writing down the equation and seeing what each side has.\n\nFirst, let's count the atoms on each side. On the left side, we have K2CrO4 and AgClO3. On the right side, KClO3 and Ag2CrO4.\n\nStarting with potassium (K). On the left, there are 2 K from K2CrO4. On the right, there's 1 K in KClO3. So K is unbalanced. Maybe I need to put a coefficient in front of KClO3 to get 2 K. Let me try putting a 2 in front of KClO3. Then the right side would have 2 K. But then the left side has only 1 K2, which is 2 K. That matches. But let's check other elements now.\n\nNext, silver (Ag). On the left, there's 1 Ag in AgClO3. On the right, there's 2 Ag in Ag2CrO4. So to balance Ag, I need 2 Ag on the left. That would mean putting a 2 in front of AgClO3. So now the left side has 2 AgClO3. Let me update that.\n\nNow, let's check the right side. The Ag is 2, which is balanced with the 2 AgClO3 on the left. Now, what about chromium (Cr)? On the left, there's 1 Cr in K2CrO4. On the right, there's 1 Cr in Ag2CrO4. So Cr is balanced. Good.\n\nOxygen (O) might be tricky. Let's check. Left side: K2CrO4 has 4 O, and each AgClO3 has 3 O. Since there are 2 AgClO3, that's 2*3=6 O. Total O on left: 4 + 6 = 10 O. On the right: KClO3 has 3 O and Ag2CrO4 has 4 O. Since there's 2 KClO3, that's 2*3=6 O. Ag2CrO4 has 4 O. Total O on right: 6 + 4 = 10 O. So O is balanced. That's good.\n\nChlorine (Cl). On the left, each AgClO3 has 1 Cl, and there are 2 of them, so 2 Cl. On the right, each KClO3 has 1 Cl, and there are 2 of them, so 2 Cl. Cl is balanced. \n\nPotassium (K): Left has 2 from K2CrO4. Right has 2 from 2 KClO3. Balanced.\n\nSo putting it all together, the balanced equation would be:\n\nK2CrO4 + 2 AgClO3 → 2 KClO3 + Ag2CrO4\n\nLet me double-check each element again:\n\nK: 2 on left, 2 on right (from 2 KClO3) → balanced.\nAg: 2 on left (from 2 AgClO3), 2 on right (Ag2CrO4) → balanced.\nCr: 1 on left, 1 on right → balanced.\nCl: 2 on left, 2 on right → balanced.\nO: Left: 4 (from K2CrO4) + 2*3 (from AgClO3) = 4 + 6 = 10. Right: 2*3 (from KClO3) + 4 (from Ag2CrO4) = 6 + 4 = 10 → balanced.\n\nEverything seems balanced. So the coefficients are 1 for K2CrO4, 2 for AgClO3, 2 for KClO3, and 1 for Ag2CrO4. Therefore, the balanced equation is K2CrO4 + 2 AgClO3 → 2 KClO3 + Ag2CrO4.\n</think>"}
