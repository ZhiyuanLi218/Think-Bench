Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nWe have a dibasic strong acid with a concentration of 60% w/v. The molecular weight (MW) is 120 g/mol. First, we need to find its molarity, which is x. Then, 200 mL of this x M acid is diluted with 800 mL of water, resulting in a new molarity y. Next, 100 mL of this y M acid reacts with 300 mL of 0.3 M NaOH, and the remaining acid's molarity is Z. Finally, this remaining acid is to react with a strong diacidic base, and we need to find the volume of 0.3 M diacidic base required to neutralize 500 mL of the remaining acid completely. The options are given as A to D.\n\nAlright, let's start breaking this down step by step.\n\n**First, finding the initial molarity x of the acid.**\n\nThe acid is 60% w/v, which means 60 grams of the acid are present in 100 mL of solution. Since the question is about molarity, which is moles per liter, I need to convert this to grams per liter first.\n\n60% w/v = 60 g/100 mL = 600 g/L.\n\nNow, to find molarity (moles per liter), we need to divide the grams per liter by the molecular weight (MW) of the acid.\n\nGiven MW = 120 g/mol.\n\nSo, molarity x = (600 g/L) / (120 g/mol) = 5 mol/L. Wait, that's 5 M? Let me check that again.\n\nYes, 600 divided by 120 is 5. So x is 5 M. But wait, the acid is dibasic. However, molarity here refers to the concentration of the acid as a whole, not the normality. Since molarity is moles per liter, regardless of the basicity, right? So even though it's dibasic, the molarity is just 5 M. So x = 5 M. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\n**Next, diluting 200 mL of this 5 M acid with 800 mL of water to get y M.**\n\nDilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.\n\nHere, M1 is 5 M, V1 is 200 mL. The total volume after dilution is 200 + 800 = 1000 mL = 1 L.\n\nSo, M2 = (5 M * 200 mL) / 1000 mL = (1000) / 1000 = 1 M. Therefore, y = 1 M.\n\nWait, let me verify. Original moles of acid in 200 mL of 5 M solution: 5 * 0.2 = 1 mole. After dilution to 1 L, the concentration is 1 mole / 1 L = 1 M. Yes, that's correct. So y is indeed 1 M.\n\n**Now, 100 mL of this y (1 M) acid reacts with 300 mL of 0.3 M NaOH. Need to find the molarity of the remaining acid, Z.**\n\nFirst, let's note that the acid is dibasic and strong. So, since it's a strong dibasic acid, it will dissociate completely into 2 H+ ions per molecule. However, when reacting with NaOH, which is a monobasic base, the reaction will depend on the stoichiometry.\n\nBut first, let's write the reaction between the acid and NaOH.\n\nLet me denote the dibasic acid as H2A. Since it's a strong acid, it will donate both protons completely. The reaction with NaOH would be:\n\nH2A + 2 NaOH → Na2A + 2 H2O\n\nSo, 1 mole of H2A reacts with 2 moles of NaOH.\n\nBut let's check if there's enough NaOH to neutralize all the acid, or if there's excess acid or base.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of H2A in 100 mL of 1 M solution:\n\nMoles of H2A = 1 M * 0.1 L = 0.1 moles.\n\nMoles of NaOH in 300 mL of 0.3 M solution:\n\nMoles of NaOH = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.\n\nNow, according to the reaction, 1 mole H2A needs 2 moles NaOH. So, moles of NaOH needed to neutralize 0.1 moles H2A would be 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles. However, we only have 0.09 moles of NaOH. Therefore, NaOH is the limiting reagent here. So, not all the acid will be neutralized. Let's find out how much H2A is neutralized.\n\nSince 2 moles NaOH neutralize 1 mole H2A, 0.09 moles NaOH will neutralize:\n\nmoles of H2A neutralized = 0.09 / 2 = 0.045 moles.\n\nTherefore, remaining moles of H2A = initial moles - neutralized moles = 0.1 - 0.045 = 0.055 moles.\n\nBut wait, hold on. However, since the reaction consumes H2A and produces Na2A, but since NaOH is in limited quantity, maybe the reaction only goes halfway? Wait, but for a strong acid and strong base, the reaction goes to completion. So, the NaOH will react as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to think in terms of equivalents. Since H2A is dibasic, each mole can provide 2 equivalents of H+ (since each H2A can donate 2 H+). Similarly, NaOH is monobasic, so each mole provides 1 equivalent of OH-.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating. Let me stick to the stoichiometry.\n\nOriginal moles H2A: 0.1\n\nMoles NaOH: 0.09\n\nReaction ratio is 1:2 (H2A:NaOH). So, to find the limiting reagent, we can divide moles by stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nFor H2A: 0.1 / 1 = 0.1\n\nFor NaOH: 0.09 / 2 = 0.045\n\nSince 0.045 < 0.1, NaOH is limiting.\n\nTherefore, all NaOH will be consumed, and some H2A will remain.\n\nAs calculated earlier, 0.045 moles H2A will react with 0.09 moles NaOH.\n\nTherefore, remaining H2A is 0.1 - 0.045 = 0.055 moles.\n\nBut also, we need to consider if there are any other species formed. Since H2A is a strong acid, and NaOH is a strong base, the reaction will go to completion, forming Na2A and water. However, since NaOH is in limited quantity, the product will be a mixture of H2A and NaHA? Wait, wait. Wait, if only part of the H2A is neutralized, then maybe the reaction is only partial. Let me think.\n\nLet me write the reaction again. If you have H2A + NaOH → NaHA + H2O. But since H2A is dibasic, maybe the first proton is neutralized first. But since NaOH is monobasic, each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of H+.\n\nBut since H2A is a strong acid, it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and A^2-.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of H+ ions.\n\nThe total moles of H+ in the acid solution is 2 * moles of H2A, because each H2A gives 2 H+.\n\nSo, initial H+ moles: 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 moles.\n\nNaOH provides OH- moles: 0.09 moles.\n\nThe reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O.\n\nSo, the OH- will neutralize H+ until one of them is exhausted.\n\nSince there are 0.2 moles H+ and 0.09 moles OH-, the OH- is the limiting reagent. So, after reaction, remaining H+ is 0.2 - 0.09 = 0.11 moles.\n\nBut since the acid is dibasic, the remaining H+ comes from remaining H2A and possibly some HA-? Wait, but since H2A is a strong acid, if it's not fully neutralized, it will remain as H2A and dissociate completely. However, if some of it is neutralized, maybe it becomes HA-? Wait, but if you have a strong dibasic acid, like H2SO4 (which is a strong acid for the first proton, weak for the second), but in this case, the problem says it's a \"strong\" dibasic acid, so maybe both protons are strong? That is, H2A dissociates completely into 2 H+ and A^2-.\n\nTherefore, if we neutralize some of the H+ with NaOH, then the remaining H+ would still be in solution as H+ ions, but the amount of H2A would have decreased.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the reaction between H2A and NaOH. Since H2A is a strong acid, it's fully dissociated. So in solution, we have 2 H+ and A^2- from each H2A. When NaOH is added, it will react with H+:\n\nH+ + OH- → H2O\n\nBut since H+ is in excess, after neutralization, the remaining H+ will be 0.11 moles. However, since the original H2A dissociated completely, the remaining H2A would be... Wait, if we remove some H+ from solution, how does that affect the H2A? If H2A is fully dissociated, then the concentration of H2A is negligible. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this problem using the concept of equivalents.\n\nSince H2A is dibasic, its n-factor (number of H+ ions it can donate) is 2. NaOH is monobasic, so its n-factor is 1.\n\nThe formula for neutralization is:\n\nEquivalents of acid = Equivalents of base\n\nBut since the reaction may not go to completion, we need to see how much of each is present.\n\nEquivalents of acid initially in 100 mL of y M (1 M) solution:\n\nEquivalents = Molarity * Volume (L) * n-factor = 1 * 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 equivalents.\n\nEquivalents of base (NaOH) in 300 mL of 0.3 M solution:\n\nEquivalents = 0.3 * 0.3 * 1 = 0.09 equivalents.\n\nSince the base is less than the acid, the base will be completely neutralized, and the remaining acid will be 0.2 - 0.09 = 0.11 equivalents.\n\nBut equivalents of acid is related to the remaining H+ ions. However, since the acid is dibasic, the remaining equivalents can be converted back to molarity.\n\nBut the problem asks for the molarity of the remaining acid, Z. Wait, but after neutralization, the solution contains remaining H2A and possibly some NaHA? Or since the acid is strong, maybe it's just H+ ions in solution?\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need to go back to the stoichiometry approach.\n\nOriginal moles of H2A: 0.1 mol.\n\nMoles of NaOH: 0.09 mol.\n\nReaction: H2A + 2 NaOH → Na2A + 2 H2O.\n\nBut since there's not enough NaOH to fully neutralize the acid, the reaction will proceed until NaOH is consumed.\n\nAs per stoichiometry, 2 moles NaOH react with 1 mole H2A. Therefore, 0.09 moles NaOH will react with 0.045 moles H2A, producing 0.045 moles Na2A and water.\n\nThus, remaining H2A is 0.1 - 0.045 = 0.055 moles.\n\nNow, the total volume after reaction is 100 mL + 300 mL = 400 mL = 0.4 L.\n\nTherefore, the concentration (molarity) of the remaining H2A is:\n\nZ = 0.055 moles / 0.4 L = 0.1375 M.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Or do we have to consider the Na2A as well? However, since Na2A is the salt of a strong base and a strong acid? Wait, no, Na2A would be the salt of a strong base (NaOH) and a strong acid (H2A). If the acid is strong, then the salt would be neutral? Wait, but in reality, if the acid is strong and the base is strong, the salt should be neutral. However, since H2A is a strong acid, A^2- would be a weak base? Wait, no—if the acid is strong, its conjugate base is weak. However, if the acid is completely dissociated, then the conjugate base (A^2-) is very weak and doesn't hydrolyze. Therefore, the solution would have remaining H2A and Na2A. But since we are asked for the molarity of the remaining acid, which would refer to the concentration of H2A? Or does it refer to the concentration of H+?\n\nWait, the problem says \"molarity of remaining acid is Z\". Since the acid is H2A, and after reaction, some H2A remains, so the molarity Z is 0.1375 M, as calculated above. However, there is also Na2A present, but that's a salt and not the acid. Therefore, Z is 0.1375 M.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Alternatively, if the problem considers the remaining \"acid\" in terms of H+ concentration, then we need to calculate the H+ concentration. However, since H2A is a strong acid, it dissociates completely. Therefore, the remaining H2A would contribute 2 * 0.1375 M = 0.275 M H+.\n\nBut the problem says \"molarity of remaining acid is Z\". Since the acid is H2A, and the molarity is moles of H2A per liter, then Z is 0.1375 M. However, in the context of the problem, when they say \"remaining acid\", they might mean the concentration of H+ or the equivalent, but I think in terms of the acid itself. Let's proceed with Z = 0.1375 M.\n\nBut let me verify once again. Suppose we have 0.055 moles of H2A in 400 mL. So yes, that's 0.055 / 0.4 = 0.1375 M. So Z = 0.1375 M.\n\nBut wait, there is also Na2A present. However, since Na2A is a salt and not the acid, it's not part of the \"remaining acid\". Therefore, Z is indeed 0.1375 M.\n\n**Now, the remaining acid (Z) is further allowed to react with a strong diacidic base. We need to calculate the volume of 0.3 M diacidic base required to neutralize 500 mL of the remaining acid completely.**\n\nFirst, let's understand what a \"strong diacidic base\" is. A diacidic base would be a base that can accept two protons. An example is Ca(OH)2, which can accept two H+ ions per formula unit. Since it's a strong base, it would dissociate completely.\n\nBut the problem says \"strong diacidic base\". Wait, maybe it's a typo and should be \"dibasic base\"? A diacidic base is a bit confusing. Wait, diacidic usually refers to an acid that can donate two protons. A dibasic base is a base that can accept two protons. Since the problem says \"diacidic base\", maybe it's a mistranslation or misnomer. Given that the previous acid is dibasic, perhaps the base is dibasic as well. So, a strong dibasic base, like Ba(OH)2, which provides 2 OH- per formula unit.\n\nAssuming that the diacidic base is actually a dibasic base, which can provide 2 OH- ions per molecule. Therefore, its n-factor is 2.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed.\n\nWe need to neutralize 500 mL of the remaining acid (which has concentration Z = 0.1375 M H2A) with a 0.3 M dibasic base.\n\nFirst, let's find the moles of H2A in 500 mL of Z M solution.\n\nMoles of H2A = 0.1375 M * 0.5 L = 0.06875 moles.\n\nSince H2A is a dibasic acid, each mole can donate 2 H+ ions. Therefore, the total equivalents of H+ is 2 * 0.06875 = 0.1375 equivalents.\n\nThe dibasic base, let's denote it as B(OH)2, which can provide 2 OH- per mole, so its n-factor is 2. Therefore, each mole of the base can neutralize 2 equivalents of H+.\n\nThe molarity of the base is 0.3 M. Therefore, the equivalents of base per liter is 0.3 M * 2 = 0.6 equivalents/L.\n\nTo neutralize 0.1375 equivalents of H+, we need:\n\nVolume (L) = equivalents needed / equivalents per liter = 0.1375 / 0.6 ≈ 0.229166... liters, which is approximately 229.17 mL. Looking at the options, option B is 229.2 mL. However, let me check again.\n\nWait, but let's do this step-by-step.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of equivalents:\n\nEquivalents of acid = Equivalents of base.\n\nFor the acid: equivalents = Molarity * Volume * n-factor.\n\nFor the remaining acid (H2A), n-factor is 2. The volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. So:\n\nEquivalents of acid = 0.1375 M * 0.5 L * 2 = 0.1375 * 1 = 0.1375 equivalents.\n\nFor the base, which is dibasic (n-factor 2), let's denote its molarity as 0.3 M. Let the volume needed be V liters.\n\nEquivalents of base = 0.3 M * V * 2 = 0.6 V.\n\nSetting equivalents equal:\n\n0.6 V = 0.1375 → V = 0.1375 / 0.6 ≈ 0.229166... liters ≈ 229.17 mL, which is option B: 229.2 mL. So that would be the answer.\n\nBut let me check again if there's a mistake in the calculation of Z.\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nOriginal moles H2A: 0.1 mol in 100 mL.\n\nMoles NaOH: 0.09 mol.\n\nReaction consumes 0.045 mol H2A, leaving 0.055 mol in 400 mL (total volume 100+300=400 mL). Therefore, Z = 0.055 / 0.4 = 0.1375 M. That seems correct.\n\nThen, for 500 mL of Z M solution, moles H2A is 0.1375 * 0.5 = 0.06875 mol. Each mole gives 2 H+, so equivalents is 0.1375. The base is 0.3 M with n-factor 2, so equivalents per liter is 0.6. Volume needed is 0.1375 / 0.6 ≈ 0.229166 L = 229.17 mL. So answer is B: 229.2 mL.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach where maybe I made a mistake in calculating Z.\n\nAlternative approach for Z:\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have considered that after neutralization, the solution contains both remaining H2A and NaHA? Wait, but if only part of the H2A is neutralized, and since H2A is a strong acid, would it form NaHA?\n\nWait, let's think about the reaction again. If you have H2A (a strong acid) reacting with NaOH (a strong base). The reaction would proceed in steps. First, H2A + NaOH → NaHA + H2O. Then, NaHA + NaOH → Na2A + H2O.\n\nBut since H2A is a strong acid, the first proton is easily donated. However, if the second proton is also strong, then NaHA would also be a strong acid? Wait, no. If H2A is a strong dibasic acid, meaning both protons are strong, then HA- would also be a strong acid? That seems unlikely. In reality, for sulfuric acid (H2SO4), the first proton is strong, but the second is weak. However, the problem states that it's a \"strong\" dibasic acid, so perhaps both protons are strong. Therefore, HA- would also be a strong acid, dissociating completely into H+ and A^2-.\n\nTherefore, adding NaOH to H2A would first neutralize one H+ to form NaHA, which would then dissociate into H+ and A^-? Wait, no. If HA- is a strong acid, then NaHA would dissociate into Na+ and HA-, and HA- would dissociate into H+ and A^2-.\n\nTherefore, in reality, adding NaOH to H2A would first neutralize H+ ions. Since both protons are strong, adding NaOH would remove H+ from solution, but since H2A is fully dissociated, the H+ comes from H2A dissociation. Therefore, if you remove some H+ with NaOH, the remaining H+ would still come from the remaining H2A. However, since the acid is strong, the amount of H2A would decrease as H+ is removed.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. However, since the stoichiometric approach earlier gave us a straightforward answer, and assuming that the problem is intended to be solved with simple stoichiometry (given that it's likely a problem for a general chemistry course), perhaps the first approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with Z = 0.1375 M, leading to answer B.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's calculate the H+ concentration after the reaction with NaOH, and then see if that gives a different result.\n\nOriginal H+ from H2A: 2 * 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol in 0.1 L. Wait, no, original solution is 100 mL of 1 M H2A. Since it's dibasic and strong, it gives 2 H+ per molecule. So concentration of H+ is 2 * 1 M = 2 M. Moles of H+ is 2 M * 0.1 L = 0.2 mol. Then adding 0.09 mol OH- from NaOH. Reaction between H+ and OH-:\n\nH+ + OH- → H2O.\n\nMoles of H+ after reaction: 0.2 - 0.09 = 0.11 mol.\n\nTotal volume is 0.4 L. Therefore, [H+] = 0.11 / 0.4 = 0.275 M.\n\nBut since the acid is dibasic and strong, the H+ concentration is 2 * [H2A] remaining. Therefore, [H2A] = [H+]/2 = 0.275 / 2 = 0.1375 M. Which matches the earlier value of Z = 0.1375 M. Therefore, this confirms that Z is indeed 0.1375 M. Therefore, the previous calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, when neutralizing 500 mL of Z M H2A with the dibasic base, the answer is 229.2 mL, option B.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA:458.3 mL\n\nB:229.2 mL\n\nC:375 mL\n\nD:187.5 mL\n\nYes, B is 229.2 mL. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me just recap all steps once again to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error.\n\n1. Initial concentration of acid: 60% w/v = 600 g/L. MW 120 g/mol. So 600 / 120 = 5 M. Correct.\n\n2. Dilution: 200 mL of 5 M to 1000 mL. 5*(200/1000)=1 M. Correct.\n\n3. 100 mL of 1 M acid (0.1 mol H2A) reacting with 300 mL 0.3 M NaOH (0.09 mol NaOH). Since 1 mol H2A needs 2 mol NaOH, 0.09 mol NaOH neutralizes 0.045 mol H2A. Remaining H2A is 0.055 mol in 400 mL. 0.055 / 0.4 = 0.1375 M. Correct.\n\n4. For neutralizing 500 mL of 0.1375 M H2A (which is 0.06875 mol H2A) with 0.3 M dibasic base. Since H2A is dibasic, equivalents = 0.06875 * 2 = 0.1375. Dibasic base has 2 equivalents per mole. So moles of base needed = 0.1375 / 2 = 0.06875 mol. Volume needed = 0.06875 / 0.3 ≈ 0.229166 L ≈ 229.17 mL. Correct. So answer is B.\n\nAlternatively, using equivalents directly:\n\nEquivalents of acid = 0.1375 M * 0.5 L * 2 = 0.1375 equivalents.\n\nEquivalents of base = 0.3 M * V * 2 = 0.6 V.\n\nSetting equal: 0.6 V = 0.1375 → V = 0.1375 / 0.6 ≈ 0.229166 L ≈ 229.17 mL. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 229.2 mL.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations. The key steps were converting the w/v to molarity, applying dilution, handling the neutralization reaction with NaOH by stoichiometry, calculating remaining acid concentration, and then using equivalents for the neutralization with the dibasic base. All steps check out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
