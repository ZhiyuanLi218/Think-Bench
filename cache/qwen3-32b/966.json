I need to figure out how many half-lives it takes to reduce 10.0 kg of a radioactive substance down to 1.0 microgram. Hmm, first, I should remember what a half-life means. A half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive substance to decay. So, after each half-life, the amount is multiplied by 1/2.\n\nStarting with 10.0 kg, and ending up with 1.0 microgram. Let me convert those units to the same measurement. 10.0 kg is 10,000 grams, right? And 1.0 microgram is 1.0 x 10^-6 grams. So, the initial amount is 10,000 grams, and the final amount is 0.000001 grams. That's a huge difference. \n\nThe formula for radioactive decay after n half-lives is N = N0 * (1/2)^n, where N is the final amount, N0 is the initial amount. So, solving for n here. Let me write that down:\n\nN = N0 * (1/2)^n\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n1.0 x 10^-6 g = 10,000 g * (1/2)^n\n\nI need to solve for n. Let me divide both sides by 10,000 g:\n\n(1.0 x 10^-6) / 10,000 = (1/2)^n\n\nCalculating the left side:\n\n1.0 x 10^-6 divided by 1.0 x 10^4 is 1.0 x 10^-10. Wait, 10^-6 divided by 10^4 is 10^(-6-4) = 10^-10. So:\n\n1.0 x 10^-10 = (1/2)^n\n\nNow, to solve for n, take the logarithm of both sides. Since the base is 1/2, maybe using natural logarithm or base 10? Let me recall the formula. \n\nTaking natural logarithm:\n\nln(1.0 x 10^-10) = ln( (1/2)^n ) = n * ln(1/2)\n\nTherefore:\n\nn = ln(1.0 x 10^-10) / ln(1/2)\n\nAlternatively, using log base 10:\n\nlog(1.0 x 10^-10) = n * log(1/2)\n\nSo:\n\nn = log(1.0 x 10^-10) / log(1/2)\n\nEither way, let me compute that. Let me use natural logarithm first. \n\nFirst, compute ln(1.0 x 10^-10). That's ln(1) + ln(10^-10) = 0 + (-10) * ln(10). Since ln(10) is approximately 2.3026. So:\n\n-10 * 2.3026 ≈ -23.026\n\nThen ln(1/2) is ln(0.5) ≈ -0.6931\n\nTherefore, n ≈ (-23.026) / (-0.6931) ≈ 33.22\n\nSo approximately 33.22 half-lives. Looking at the answer choices, D is 34. But wait, let me check if I did the calculation correctly. Alternatively, maybe using base 10 logs?\n\nLet me try that. log(1.0 x 10^-10) is log(10^-10) = -10. \n\nThen log(1/2) is log(0.5) ≈ -0.3010\n\nSo n ≈ (-10) / (-0.3010) ≈ 33.22. Same result. So approximately 33.22 half-lives. Since the question asks for approximately how many, and the options are A:8, B:13, C:29, D:34. The closest is D:34. But wait, 33.22 is closer to 33 than 34, but maybe the options don't have 33. However, the answer choices given are A, B, C, D as 8,13,29,34. So the closest is D:34. But maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion?\n\nWait, let me check the initial conversion again. 10.0 kg is 10,000 grams. 1.0 microgram is 1.0 x 10^-6 grams. So yes, 10^4 grams to 10^-6 grams is a factor of 10^10. So the ratio is 10^-10. So the calculation is correct. So the number of half-lives is approximately 33.2. So the answer is D:34. But wait, maybe I need to round up because you can't have a fraction of a half-life? But the question says \"approximately how many half-lives\", so 33.2 is approximately 33. But since 33.2 is closer to 33 than 34, but the options don't have 33. The options are 8,13,29,34. So perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the formula. Let me check again. The formula is N = N0*(1/2)^n. Let me check with n=33. Then (1/2)^33 is roughly 1/(2^33). What is 2^10=1024≈10^3, so 2^10≈10^3. Then 2^30≈(10^3)^3=10^9. Therefore, 2^33≈2^3 * 10^9=8*10^9. So 1/(2^33)≈1/(8*10^9)=1.25*10^-10. Which is close to 1*10^-10. So if (1/2)^n ≈1*10^-10, then n≈33.2. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 33.2, so the closest option is D:34. But maybe the answer expects a different approach? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Let me check the numbers again. Initial amount is 10 kg, which is 10,000 grams. Final amount is 1 microgram, which is 0.000001 grams. So the ratio is 10,000 / 0.000001 = 10^4 / 10^-6 = 10^10. So the substance has decayed by a factor of 10^10. Each half-life reduces it by a factor of 2. So we need to find n such that 2^n ≈ 10^10. So n ≈ log2(10^10) = 10 * log2(10). Since log2(10) is approximately 3.3219. Therefore, 10 * 3.3219 ≈ 33.219. So same result. So n≈33.2. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 33.2, so the closest option is D:34. But why isn't 33 an option? The options are 8,13,29,34. So 34 is the closest. So answer D.\n\nBut let me check if the original problem had different numbers? Wait, the original problem says \"reduce 10.0 kg to 1.0 microgram\". Let me confirm the calculation once more. 10 kg is 10^4 grams. 1 microgram is 10^-6 grams. The ratio is 10^4 / 10^-6 = 10^10. So the number of half-lives is log2(10^10) ≈ 33.2. So yes. So answer D:34. So the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are in some other unit? Wait, no. The question is about number of half-lives, so the answer is approximately 33.2, so the closest is D:34. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
