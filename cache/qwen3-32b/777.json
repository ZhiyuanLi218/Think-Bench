The presence of a dielectric (such as mica) increases the capacitance of the capacitor due to the dielectric constant $ \\varepsilon_r $.

The question is about a parallel plate capacitor with a mica dielectric that's connected to a constant voltage DC power supply. Then the mica is removed, and we have to determine what happens to the charge on the plates and the electric field strength.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a capacitor is connected to a voltage source, the voltage across it is fixed. The formula for capacitance is C = ε₀ε_r * A / d, where ε_r is the dielectric constant. Mica has a dielectric constant higher than 1, so when it's present, the capacitance is higher compared to when there's no dielectric (which would be air or vacuum, ε_r ≈ 1).\n\nSo when the mica is removed, the dielectric constant ε_r decreases. Since the capacitor is connected to a constant voltage, the voltage V remains the same. The charge Q on the capacitor is given by Q = C * V. If the capacitance C decreases (because ε_r decreases), then Q must also decrease. So the charge on the plates should decrease. That narrows down the options to B or D.\n\nNow, the electric field E between the plates. The electric field in a capacitor is given by E = V / d, where V is the voltage and d is the separation between the plates. Since the capacitor is still connected to the same voltage source, V is constant, and d hasn't changed. Therefore, E should remain the same. So the electric field strength doesn't change. \n\nLooking back at the options: B says the charge decreases and the electric field increases, which would be incorrect because E stays the same. D says the charge decreases and the electric field remains the same. So the correct answer must be D.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The electric field can also be related to the surface charge density σ. Normally, E = σ / ε₀, but with a dielectric, it's E = σ_free / (ε₀ ε_r). However, when the dielectric is removed, σ_free (the free charge) decreases. So if σ decreases, but E is V/d which is fixed, there's a consistency here. Since V is fixed and d is fixed, E must stay the same. Therefore, even though σ decreases, the electric field remains because the voltage is maintained by the power supply. That confirms that E remains the same. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
