So, the question is about the parallax of a star and how its brightness changes when we move it to a different distance. The given parallax is 2 milliarcseconds, and we need to find the factor by which the brightness (flux) changes if we place the star at 20 parsecs. The options are A to D, so I need to calculate the correct factor and choose the right one.\n\nFirst, I remember that the parallax angle is related to the distance of the star. The formula for distance in parsecs is d = 1/p, where p is the parallax in arcseconds. But wait, here the parallax is given in milliarcseconds. Let me check that. Yes, 1 arcsecond is 1000 milliarcseconds. So, the parallax p is 2 milliarcseconds, which is 2/1000 arcseconds. Let me calculate the original distance.\n\nOriginal distance d_original = 1 / p. But since p is in arcseconds, I need to convert 2 milliarcseconds to arcseconds. So p = 2e-3 arcseconds. Therefore, d_original = 1 / (2e-3) parsecs. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.002 is 500 parsecs. So the star is originally 500 parsecs away.\n\nNow, the question is about moving it to 20 parsecs. So we need to compare the flux at the original distance (500 pc) with the flux at 20 pc. The flux (brightness) from a star decreases with the square of the distance. So the formula is F ∝ 1/d². Therefore, the factor by which the brightness changes is (d_original / d_new)². Wait, because if you move the star closer, the flux increases. So if you take the ratio of the new flux to the original flux, it's (original distance / new distance) squared.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nFlux factor = (d_original / d_new)².\n\nOriginal distance is 500 pc, new distance is 20 pc. So:\n\nFlux factor = (500 / 20)² = (25)² = 625.\n\nHmm, 625 is close to one of the options. Let me check the options again. The options are A:~530, B:~170, C:~410, D:~620. So 625 is closest to D:~620. Therefore, the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations. First, confirm the original distance. Parallax p is 2 milliarcseconds. Since 1 parsec is defined as the distance where parallax is 1 arcsecond, so distance d (pc) = 1 / p (arcsec). So converting p to arcseconds: 2 milliarcseconds is 0.002 arcseconds. Therefore, d_original = 1 / 0.002 = 500 parsecs. That's correct.\n\nThen moving to 20 parsecs. The flux is inversely proportional to distance squared. So if the star is moved closer, the flux increases. The ratio of distances is 500 / 20 = 25. Squared is 625. So the flux increases by a factor of 625. The options have D as ~620, which is approximately 625. So D is the correct answer. The answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in the direction of the change. Suppose the star is originally at 500 pc, and we move it to 20 pc. The new distance is smaller, so the flux should be higher. Therefore, the factor is (original distance / new distance)^2. Yes, that's correct. If you move it closer, the flux goes up. So yes, 500/20 is 25, squared is 625. So D is the answer. The options have D as ~620, which is the closest to 625. So the answer is D.\n\nAnother way to think: maybe I confused inverse square law? Let me recall. The flux F = L / (4πd²), where L is luminosity. So if you change d, F is inversely proportional to d². Therefore, F_new / F_original = (d_original / d_new)². Yes, that's right. So if you put the star at a distance d_new, compared to its original distance d_original, the flux changes by that factor. So yes, 625 is the factor. Therefore, answer D.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
