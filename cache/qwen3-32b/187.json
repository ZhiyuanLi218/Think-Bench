Here's a concise breakdown of its key aspects:\n\n---\n\n### **Purpose**\nTo test the prevailing **plum pudding model** of the atom (proposed by J.J. Thomson), which assumed atoms were uniformly filled with positive charge with electrons embedded in it. Rutherford hypothesized that α-particles (helium nuclei, $ ^4_2\\text{He}^{2+} $) would pass through a thin gold foil with minimal deflection if this model were correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Setup**\n- **α-particle source**: A radioactive material (e.g., polonium) emitted α-particles.\n- **Gold foil**: A thin layer of gold (about $10^{-7}$ m thick) was used as the target.\n- **Detection**: A fluorescent screen and a microscope observed the α-particles' scattering angles.\n\n---\n\n### **Observations**\n1. **Most α-particles passed through** the foil with little or no deflection.\n2. **Some were deflected at large angles** (even >90°).\n3. **A few bounced back** (reflected nearly 180°).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusions**\n1. **Atoms are mostly empty space**: Most α-particles passed through without obstruction.\n2. **Nuclear model of the atom**: The large deflections implied a small, dense, positively charged **nucleus** at the atom's center.\n3. **Electrons orbit the nucleus**: The nucleus's tiny size (≈ $10^{-15}$ m vs. atom size $10^{-10}$ m) explained the rare collisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Significance**\n- **Disproved the plum pudding model**: The experiment revealed that positive charge and mass are concentrated in a nucleus.\n- **Foundation for modern atomic theory**: Rutherford's nuclear model paved the way for Bohr's planetary model and quantum mechanics.\n- **Mathematical derivation**: Rutherford derived a formula for scattering angles, confirming the inverse-square law for electrostatic repulsion.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\nThe probability of scattering at an angle $ \\theta $ is proportional to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n$$\nThis \"Rutherford scattering formula\" validated the nuclear model quantitatively.\n\n---\n\n### **Legacy**\nThis experiment revolutionized physics, leading to the discovery of the nucleus and the development of quantum theories. It remains a cornerstone in understanding atomic and nuclear structure.","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, the user mentioned the alpha particle scattering experiment. I need to recall what that is. Oh right, it's the famous experiment done by Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues, Geiger and Marsden. They shot alpha particles at a thin gold foil and observed their scattering. \n\nSo the main purpose of this experiment was to test the plum pudding model of the atom, which was proposed by J.J. Thomson. In that model, the atom was thought to have a uniform positive charge with electrons embedded in it, like raisins in a pudding. But Rutherford's experiment showed something different.\n\nIn the experiment, most of the alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil, which made sense if the atom was mostly empty space. But some were deflected at large angles, and a very few even bounced back. That was unexpected according to the plum pudding model. Rutherford realized that this could only happen if the positive charge was concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom. So the conclusion was that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus, with electrons orbiting around it.\n\nI should explain the setup, the observations, and the conclusions. Maybe mention how this led to the nuclear model of the atom. Also, the significance of the experiment in the history of atomic theory. Perhaps note that the gold foil was chosen because it's malleable and can be made very thin, allowing alpha particles to pass through. Also, alpha particles are helium nuclei, so they're relatively heavy and positively charged. The fact that most went through showed that atoms are mostly empty space, but the few that deflected showed the nucleus exists.\n\nWait, the user just wrote \"C) α particle scattering experiment\" and maybe expects a question about it? But the original query is incomplete. Maybe they want an explanation of the experiment. Let me structure the answer with key points: purpose, setup, observations, conclusions, significance. Also, maybe mention the mathematical derivation of the scattering formula if needed, but perhaps that's too detailed unless the user asks. Since the user just mentioned the experiment, a general overview is better.\n\nCheck if there's any common misconceptions to address. For example, some might think that the nucleus is as big as the atom, but this experiment showed it's much smaller. Also, the experiment didn't disprove the plum pudding model directly but showed it was incorrect, leading to the nuclear model. Rutherford's model was later refined by Bohr, but the experiment itself was pivotal in changing atomic theory.\n\nMake sure to mention the key scientists involved: Rutherford, Geiger, Marsden. The year might be 1909 for the experiment, and the publication in 1911. Also, the term \"Rutherford scattering\" might be relevant. The experiment used a radioactive source emitting alpha particles, a gold foil, a fluorescent screen to detect the alpha particles, and a microscope to observe the scintillations.\n\nIn summary, the alpha particle scattering experiment demonstrated the existence of the atomic nucleus, leading to the nuclear model of the atom and revolutionizing our understanding of atomic structure.\n</think>"}
