Hmm, angle ABC means the angle at point B, right? So, vertex at B, with segments BA and BC forming the angle. To find this angle, I remember that in vectors, the angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula. So maybe I should find the vectors BA and BC, then use the dot product to calculate the angle between them. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me recall the coordinates of the points:\n\nA is (1, -11, 2)\n\nB is (3, -4, 1)\n\nC is (-2, 1, -1)\n\nSo vectors BA and BC. Wait, vector BA is from B to A, right? Wait, no. Wait, angle at B, so the two vectors forming the angle are BA and BC. But vectors are usually defined from the vertex. Wait, actually, in terms of vectors, if we are at point B, then the vectors would be BA and BC. But to compute the angle between them, we need vectors starting at B. So vector BA is A - B, and vector BC is C - B. Wait, no, actually, if we want vectors starting at B, then vector BA is from B to A, which is A - B. Similarly, vector BC is from B to C, which is C - B. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if you have point B and you want to get to A, it's A - B. So vector BA is A - B? Wait, but usually vector BA is from B to A. But in terms of coordinates, yes, it would be A minus B. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, vector from point P to point Q is Q - P. So vector BA would be A - B. Wait, no, if it's BA, then it's from B to A, so it's A - B. Wait, no, if you have vector BA, it's starting at B and ending at A, so you subtract the initial point from the terminal point. So yes, vector BA is A - B. Similarly, vector BC is C - B.\n\nSo first, let me compute vectors BA and BC.\n\nVector BA = A - B = (1 - 3, -11 - (-4), 2 - 1) = (-2, -7, 1)\n\nVector BC = C - B = (-2 - 3, 1 - (-4), -1 - 1) = (-5, 5, -2)\n\nOkay, so vectors BA is (-2, -7, 1) and BC is (-5, 5, -2). Now, to find the angle between them, we can use the dot product formula:\n\ncos(theta) = (BA · BC) / (|BA| |BC|)\n\nSo first, compute the dot product BA · BC.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(-2)(-5) + (-7)(5) + (1)(-2) = 10 - 35 - 2 = 10 - 37 = -27\n\nHmm, so the dot product is -27. Now, compute the magnitudes of BA and BC.\n\nFirst, |BA|:\n\nsqrt((-2)^2 + (-7)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 49 + 1) = sqrt(54) = sqrt(9*6) = 3*sqrt(6)\n\nThen, |BC|:\n\nsqrt((-5)^2 + (5)^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25 + 4) = sqrt(54) as well? Wait, 25 + 25 is 50, plus 4 is 54. So sqrt(54) = 3*sqrt(6). Wait, so both vectors have magnitude 3*sqrt(6). Interesting.\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) = (-27) / (3*sqrt(6) * 3*sqrt(6)) = (-27)/(9*6) = (-27)/54 = -0.5\n\nSo cos(theta) = -0.5. Now, what angle has a cosine of -0.5? Well, I know that cos(120 degrees) = -0.5. Let me confirm:\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5, so cos(180° - 60°) = cos(120°) = -0.5. Yes, that's right. Therefore theta is 120 degrees.\n\nWait, so angle ABC is 120 degrees? Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, vectors BA and BC:\n\nVector BA: A - B = (1-3, -11 - (-4), 2 - 1) = (-2, -7, 1). Correct.\n\nVector BC: C - B = (-2 - 3, 1 - (-4), -1 - 1) = (-5, 5, -2). Correct.\n\nDot product: (-2)(-5) + (-7)(5) + (1)(-2) = 10 - 35 - 2 = -27. Correct.\n\n|BA|: sqrt(4 + 49 + 1) = sqrt(54). Correct. 54 is 9*6, so 3√6.\n\n|BC|: sqrt(25 + 25 + 4) = sqrt(54). Same as above. Therefore denominator is 3√6 * 3√6 = 9*6 = 54. Numerator is -27. So -27/54 = -0.5. So arccos(-0.5) is 120 degrees. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I didn't mix up the vectors. Because angle at B is between BA and BC, but sometimes people might get confused between BA and AB. Let me think.\n\nIf we have angle at B, then the two sides are BA and BC. So vectors from B to A and from B to C. So vectors BA and BC. So yes, the angle between BA and BC is indeed the angle at B. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use vectors AB and BC, but no, AB is from A to B, which would be different. Wait, no. If you want vectors emanating from B, then AB is from A to B, but to get a vector from B, you need BA and BC. So yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to check is to compute the lengths of BA, BC, and AC, then use the Law of Cosines. Maybe that's a good idea to verify.\n\nSo let me try that approach as well.\n\nFirst, compute lengths BA, BC, and AC.\n\nWait, BA is |BA| which we already found as 3√6.\n\nSimilarly, BC is 3√6. Then AC is the distance between A and C.\n\nCompute AC:\n\nA is (1, -11, 2), C is (-2, 1, -1). So vector AC is C - A = (-2 - 1, 1 - (-11), -1 - 2) = (-3, 12, -3)\n\nThen |AC| is sqrt((-3)^2 + 12^2 + (-3)^2) = sqrt(9 + 144 + 9) = sqrt(162) = sqrt(81*2) = 9√2.\n\nSo according to the Law of Cosines:\n\nIn triangle ABC, (AC)^2 = (BA)^2 + (BC)^2 - 2*(BA)*(BC)*cos(theta), where theta is angle at B.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\nLeft-hand side: |AC|² = (9√2)^2 = 81*2 = 162\n\nRight-hand side: |BA|² + |BC|² - 2|BA||BC|cos(theta) = (54) + (54) - 2*(3√6)*(3√6)*cos(theta) = 108 - 2*(9*6)*cos(theta) = 108 - 108*cos(theta)\n\nSo set equal:\n\n162 = 108 - 108*cos(theta)\n\nSubtract 108 from both sides:\n\n54 = -108*cos(theta)\n\nDivide both sides by -108:\n\ncos(theta) = -54 / 108 = -0.5\n\nWhich is the same result as before. Therefore theta = arccos(-0.5) = 120 degrees. So this confirms the earlier result. Therefore angle ABC is 120 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120 degrees. Let me check once more for calculation errors. Let me recheck the distance AC.\n\nCoordinates of A: (1, -11, 2); coordinates of C: (-2, 1, -1). The differences are:\n\nx: -2 - 1 = -3\n\ny: 1 - (-11) = 12\n\nz: -1 - 2 = -3\n\nYes, so squared differences: 9, 144, 9. Sum is 162, sqrt(162) is 9√2. Correct.\n\nLaw of Cosines gives us 162 = 54 + 54 - 2*(54)*cos(theta). Wait, hold on, wait, |BA|² is 54, |BC|² is 54, so 54 + 54 = 108. Then - 2*(BA)*(BC)*cos(theta). Wait, BA and BC are the lengths, which are 3√6 each, so 3√6 * 3√6 is 9*6=54. So -2*(54)*cos(theta). Therefore total RHS is 108 - 108 cos(theta). Wait, 2*54 is 108. Yes. So 162 = 108 - 108 cos(theta). Therefore solving gives cos(theta) = -0.5. Correct. So theta is 120 degrees. All steps check out.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120 degrees. Let me just check if there's any chance that I should have taken the absolute value or something, but no, because the cosine is negative, which would correspond to an angle between 90 and 180 degrees, which makes sense because if the dot product is negative, the angle is obtuse. Since BA and BC are both going from B, and depending on their direction, the angle could be obtuse. So 120 degrees is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if I had messed up the vectors, say, if I had taken AB and BC instead of BA and BC, then the angle would be different. Let me just check that possibility. Suppose someone thought vectors AB and BC. Let's see what would happen.\n\nVector AB is B - A = (3 - 1, -4 - (-11), 1 - 2) = (2, 7, -1)\n\nVector BC is C - B = (-5, 5, -2) as before.\n\nThen the angle between AB and BC would be calculated as:\n\nAB · BC = (2)(-5) + (7)(5) + (-1)(-2) = -10 + 35 + 2 = 27\n\nThen |AB| is sqrt(2² + 7² + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 49 + 1) = sqrt(54) same as before. |BC| is same sqrt(54). So cos(theta) = 27 / (sqrt(54)*sqrt(54)) = 27/54 = 0.5, so theta is 60 degrees. But that's the angle between AB and BC, which is not the angle at B. The angle at B is between BA and BC, not AB and BC. So if someone did that, they would get 60 degrees, but that's incorrect. But since we checked with Law of Cosines and got 120 degrees, which is supplementary, that makes sense because the angle between AB and BC is 60 degrees, while the angle between BA and BC is 180 - 60 = 120 degrees. So that shows the importance of getting the vectors right.\n\nTherefore, since I did the correct calculation with BA and BC, and confirmed with Law of Cosines, I think 120 degrees is correct. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe measure of angle ABC is \\boxed{120} degrees.\n</think>"}
