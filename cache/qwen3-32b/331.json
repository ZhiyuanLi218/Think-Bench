Solubility in Water (Clear Transparent Solution)**\n\nThe mixture dissolves in water to form a **clear, transparent solution**, indicating that **both components are soluble in water**.\n\n- **NaCl** and **KCl** are both highly soluble in water.\n- **MgSO₄** is also soluble in water.\n- **CaCO₃**, however, is **not soluble** in water and would remain as a precipitate.\n\nThus, **CaCO₃ cannot be one of the components**, eliminating **Option C (KCl, CaCO₃)**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Flame Test (Purple Color through Cobalt Glass)**\n\nThe **flame test** shows a **purple color** when viewed through **cobalt glass**, which is characteristic of **potassium (K⁺)** ions.\n\n- **KCl** contains K⁺, so its presence is confirmed.\n- **NaCl** contains Na⁺, which gives a **yellow** flame, but cobalt glass is used to **filter out** the yellow sodium light to observe potassium.\n- Since the observed color is **purple**, **KCl must be present**.\n\nTherefore, **Option D (MgSO₄, NaCl)**, which does not contain KCl, is also **eliminated**.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Let's go through each step one by one.\n\nFirst, the mixture is dissolved in water and forms a clear, transparent solution. That means both components are soluble in water. Let me recall the solubility of each compound:\n\n- NaCl is definitely soluble in water. Table salt dissolves easily.\n- KCl is also very soluble in water, similar to NaCl.\n- MgSO4, which is Epsom salt, is soluble in water. I think it's commonly used in some solutions.\n- CaCO3, calcium carbonate, is not soluble in water. It's the main component of limestone and doesn't dissolve well in water. So if CaCO3 was part of the mixture, the solution wouldn't be clear—it would be cloudy or have precipitate. Therefore, since the solution is clear, CaCO3 can't be one of the components. So option C (KCl and CaCO3) is out because CaCO3 isn't soluble. Also, any option with CaCO3 is out, so maybe C is not correct.\n\nSo the possible options are A, B, or D.\n\nNext, the flame test gives a purple color through cobalt glass. Flame tests are used to identify metal ions. The purple color through cobalt glass is characteristic of potassium ions (K+). Cobalt glass is used to filter out sodium's yellow flame, so if there's K+ present, you see purple. So this suggests that KCl is in the mixture because KCl contains K+.\n\nSo the mixture must contain KCl. Looking at the options, A is KCl and NaCl, B is KCl and MgSO4, D is MgSO4 and NaCl. Since the flame test shows K is present, the mixture must include KCl. Therefore, options A and B are possible, D doesn't have KCl so it's out.\n\nThird experiment: Adding alkali (which is a base, like NaOH or KOH) to the solution produces a white precipitate. Let's think about what each component would do when a base is added.\n\nIf the solution contains MgSO4, then adding a base would react with Mg²+ ions. Mg²+ + 2OH- → Mg(OH)2, which is a white precipitate. So if MgSO4 is present, adding alkali would produce a white precipitate. \n\nIf the solution has NaCl or KCl, adding alkali wouldn't produce a precipitate because Na+ and K+ don't form insoluble hydroxides. Their hydroxides are soluble. So if the mixture is KCl and NaCl (option A), adding alkali wouldn't result in a precipitate. But the experiment says there is a white precipitate. Therefore, option A is out. \n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain MgSO4. Since we already know from the flame test that KCl is present, the correct option is B: KCl and MgSO4.\n\nLet me just check again. \n\nMixture: KCl and MgSO4. Both are soluble, so step 1 is satisfied. Flame test shows K+ (purple), step 2. Adding alkali (OH-), Mg²+ reacts to form Mg(OH)2 precipitate, step 3. Yes, that all fits. So the answer should be B.\n</think>"}
