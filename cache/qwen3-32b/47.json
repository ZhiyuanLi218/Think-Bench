So, there's a bag with yellow and blue marbles. The current ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3. Then, if I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes 7:3. I need to find out how many blue marbles were there originally. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a ratio means. If the ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3, that means for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. But ratios can also represent parts of a whole. So maybe I can assign variables to represent the actual numbers of marbles. Let me try that.\n\nLet me let the number of blue marbles be 4x and the number of yellow marbles be 3x, where x is some positive integer. This way, the ratio remains 4:3. That seems like a good starting point.\n\nSo originally:\n- Blue marbles = 4x\n- Yellow marbles = 3x\n\nThen, according to the problem, we add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles. Let me write down the new quantities.\n\nAfter adding and removing:\n- New number of blue marbles = 4x + 5\n- New number of yellow marbles = 3x - 3\n\nAnd the new ratio is 7:3. So, the ratio of blue to yellow after these changes is 7/3. Therefore, I can set up a proportion:\n\n(4x + 5) / (3x - 3) = 7 / 3\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for x. Let me cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.\n\n3*(4x + 5) = 7*(3x - 3)\n\nLet me compute both sides:\n\nLeft side: 3*(4x + 5) = 12x + 15\n\nRight side: 7*(3x - 3) = 21x - 21\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\nHmm, let me solve for x. Let's subtract 12x from both sides:\n\n15 = 9x - 21\n\nThen, add 21 to both sides:\n\n15 + 21 = 9x\n\n36 = 9x\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nx = 4\n\nOkay, so x is 4. Now, remember that originally the number of blue marbles was 4x. Therefore, substituting x = 4:\n\nOriginal blue marbles = 4*4 = 16\n\nLet me check if this works with the rest of the problem.\n\nOriginal blue: 16, original yellow: 3x = 12.\n\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles: 16 + 5 = 21\n\nAfter removing 3 yellow marbles: 12 - 3 = 9\n\nSo the new ratio is 21:9. Let me simplify that. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 7:3. Which matches the given ratio. So that checks out!\n\nWait, so that seems correct. But let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my equations.\n\nOriginal ratio 4:3, so blue is 4x and yellow is 3x. Then adding 5 blue and subtracting 3 yellow. The new ratio is 7:3. So equation (4x + 5)/(3x - 3) = 7/3. Cross multiply, 3*(4x + 5) = 7*(3x - 3). Which gives 12x + 15 = 21x -21. Then 15 +21 = 21x -12x => 36=9x => x=4. Yes, that seems correct. So original blue marbles are 16. So the answer is 16.\n\nBut let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem or if there's any possibility of another answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution with different variables. Let me try that to verify.\n\nLet me let B be the original number of blue marbles and Y be the original number of yellow marbles.\n\nGiven that B/Y = 4/3. Therefore, cross multiplying, 3B = 4Y. So 3B - 4Y = 0.\n\nAfter adding 5 blue and removing 3 yellow, the ratio is 7/3. Therefore:\n\n(B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n3(B + 5) = 7(Y - 3)\n\nWhich is 3B + 15 = 7Y - 21\n\nNow, from the first equation, we have 3B = 4Y. Let me substitute 3B in the second equation with 4Y.\n\nSo replacing 3B with 4Y:\n\n4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21\n\nSubtract 4Y from both sides:\n\n15 = 3Y - 21\n\nAdd 21:\n\n36 = 3Y => Y = 12\n\nThen, since 3B = 4Y, plug in Y=12:\n\n3B = 4*12 = 48 => B = 16\n\nSame result! So that's consistent. Therefore, original number of blue marbles is 16.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 16. Seems solid.\n\nBut let me check once more with actual numbers.\n\nOriginal marbles: Blue=16, Yellow=12.\n\nAfter adding 5 blue: 16+5=21\n\nAfter removing 3 yellow: 12-3=9\n\nRatio 21:9 simplifies to 7:3. Perfect. So that's exactly what was supposed to happen. Therefore, the answer is correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes here. Both methods give the same answer, and plugging back in confirms it. So I think 16 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe original number of blue marbles was \\boxed{16}.\n</think>"}
