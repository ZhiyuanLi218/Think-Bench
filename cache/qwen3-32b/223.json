Hmm, let me recall some trigonometric identities. \n\nFirst, I know that sec x is 1/cos x and tan x is sin x / cos x. Similarly, csc x is 1/sin x and cot x is cos x / sin x. Maybe I can express everything in terms of sin x and cos x?\n\nGiven sec x + tan x = 22/7, let me write that out:\n\n1/cos x + sin x / cos x = 22/7\n\nSo combining those terms:\n\n(1 + sin x)/cos x = 22/7\n\nHmm, interesting. Maybe I can find expressions for sin x and cos x?\n\nAlso, I need to find csc x + cot x, which would be:\n\n1/sin x + cos x / sin x = (1 + cos x)/sin x\n\nSo if I can find (1 + cos x)/sin x, that would be the value of csc x + cot x. \n\nSo I need to relate this to the given equation (1 + sin x)/cos x = 22/7. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me call A = (1 + sin x)/cos x = 22/7\n\nAnd I need to find B = (1 + cos x)/sin x = ?\n\nIs there a relationship between A and B?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve for sin x and cos x?\n\nLet me try to solve for sin x and cos x. Let me let’s take the equation:\n\n(1 + sin x)/cos x = 22/7\n\nLet me call this Equation (1). Let me cross multiply:\n\n1 + sin x = (22/7) cos x\n\nAlso, I know that sin²x + cos²x = 1. Maybe I can use that.\n\nSo I have two equations:\n\n1. 1 + sin x = (22/7) cos x\n\n2. sin²x + cos²x = 1\n\nLet me try to solve these equations. Let me express sin x from Equation (1):\n\nFrom Equation (1):\n\nsin x = (22/7) cos x - 1\n\nLet me plug this into Equation (2):\n\n[(22/7 cos x - 1)]² + cos²x = 1\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n( (22/7 cos x)^2 - 2*(22/7 cos x)*1 + 1^2 ) + cos²x = 1\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (22/7)^2 cos²x\n\nSecond term: -2*(22/7) cos x\n\nThird term: 1\n\nFourth term: + cos²x\n\nSo altogether:\n\n( (22/7)^2 cos²x + cos²x ) - (44/7 cos x) + 1 = 1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n( [ (22/7)^2 + 1 ] cos²x ) - (44/7 cos x ) = 0\n\nLet me compute (22/7)^2 + 1:\n\n(22/7)^2 is 484/49, and adding 1 is 484/49 + 49/49 = 533/49\n\nSo:\n\n(533/49) cos²x - (44/7) cos x = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n533 cos²x - 44*7 cos x = 0\n\nCalculate 44*7: 308\n\nSo:\n\n533 cos²x - 308 cos x = 0\n\nFactor out cos x:\n\ncos x (533 cos x - 308) = 0\n\nSo either cos x = 0 or 533 cos x - 308 = 0\n\nBut cos x can't be 0, because in the original equation, sec x and tan x would be undefined. Therefore:\n\n533 cos x - 308 = 0 => cos x = 308 / 533\n\nSimplify 308/533? Let me check if they have common factors. Let me see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by... Let me check GCD(308, 533). \n\nFind GCD(308, 533). 533 divided by 308 is 1 with remainder 225. Then GCD(308, 225). 308 divided by 225 is 1 with remainder 83. GCD(225, 83). 225 divided by 83 is 2 with remainder 59. GCD(83,59). 83 divided by 59 is 1 with remainder 24. GCD(59,24). 59 divided by 24 is 2 with remainder 11. GCD(24,11). 24 divided by 11 is 2 with remainder 2. GCD(11,2). 11 divided by 2 is 5 with remainder 1. GCD(2,1). Which is 1. Therefore, 308/533 is reduced.\n\nSo cos x = 308/533. Then, from Equation (1):\n\nsin x = (22/7) cos x - 1 = (22/7)*(308/533) - 1\n\nCalculate (22/7)*(308/533):\n\nFirst note that 308 divided by 7 is 44. So 22*(44)/533 = 968 / 533\n\nTherefore, sin x = 968/533 - 1 = (968 - 533)/533 = 435/533\n\nSo sin x = 435/533. Let me check if that reduces? Let me check GCD(435, 533). \n\nDivide 533 by 435: 1 with remainder 98. GCD(435,98). 435 divided by 98 is 4 with remainder 43. GCD(98,43). 98 divided by 43 is 2 with remainder 12. GCD(43,12). 43 divided by 12 is 3 with remainder 7. GCD(12,7). 12 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 5. GCD(7,5). 7 divided by 5 is 1 with remainder 2. GCD(5,2). GCD(2,1). Which is 1. So 435/533 is reduced.\n\nTherefore, sin x = 435/533 and cos x = 308/533.\n\nNow, need to compute csc x + cot x = (1 + cos x)/sin x. Let me compute that:\n\n(1 + cos x)/sin x = [1 + 308/533] / (435/533) = [ (533 + 308)/533 ] / (435/533 ) = (841/533) / (435/533) = 841 / 435\n\nSimplify 841/435. Let me check if they have common factors. Let me check GCD(841,435). \n\nFirst, note that 841 is 29 squared (29*29=841). Let me check 29*15=435? 29*10=290, 29*5=145, so 290+145=435. Yes! So 435 = 29*15. Therefore, 841 is 29², so GCD(29², 29*15) = 29. Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 29:\n\nNumerator: 841 /29 = 29\n\nDenominator: 435 /29 = 15\n\nTherefore, 841/435 reduces to 29/15. \n\nSo csc x + cot x = 29/15. Therefore, m = 29, n = 15, so m + n = 44.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, starting from sec x + tan x = 22/7. Then converting to (1 + sin x)/cos x = 22/7. Then solving for sin x in terms of cos x. Then plugging into Pythagorean identity. Then expanding the square. Let me check the expansion again:\n\n(22/7 cos x - 1)^2 + cos^2 x = 1\n\nExpanding (a - b)^2: a² - 2ab + b². So:\n\n( (22/7 cos x)^2 - 2*(22/7 cos x)*1 + 1^2 ) + cos²x = 1. Correct.\n\nThen combining terms:\n\n( (22/7)^2 cos²x + cos²x ) - (44/7 cos x) + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nThen combining coefficients:\n\n(22²/7² + 1) cos²x - 44/7 cos x + 1 - 1 = 0 => same as before. Correct.\n\nCalculating 22² + 7² over 7²? Wait:\n\nWait, (22/7)^2 + 1 = 484/49 + 49/49 = 533/49. Correct.\n\nSo 533/49 cos²x - 44/7 cos x = 0. Multiply by 49: 533 cos²x - 308 cos x = 0. Correct. Then factoring cos x (533 cos x - 308) = 0. Correct. Then cos x = 308/533. Correct.\n\nThen sin x = 22/7 * cos x - 1. Let me calculate 22/7 * 308/533. Since 308 divided by 7 is 44, yes, 22*44 is 968. So 968/533 - 1 is 435/533. Correct.\n\nThen csc x + cot x is (1 + cos x)/sin x. Let me compute 1 + cos x: 1 + 308/533 = 533/533 + 308/533 = 841/533. Then divide by sin x = 435/533: 841/533 divided by 435/533 is 841/435. Correct.\n\nThen simplifying 841/435. Since 29*29 is 841 and 29*15 is 435. So divide numerator and denominator by 29: 29/15. Therefore, 29 + 15 is 44. \n\nBut let me check if 29 and 15 have any common factors. 29 is prime, and 15 is 3*5, so no. Therefore, 29/15 is reduced. So m + n is 29 + 15 = 44. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Find m + n.\" So 44? But 44 is the numerator in the original sec x + tan x. Maybe that's a coincidence. Let me check if there's another way to do this problem that could confirm this result.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that there's a relationship between sec x + tan x and csc x + cot x. Maybe using some reciprocal or conjugate?\n\nLet me think. Let me denote sec x + tan x = 22/7. If I rationalize it, multiplying numerator and denominator by sec x - tan x. Wait, since (sec x + tan x)(sec x - tan x) = sec²x - tan²x = 1. Because sec²x - tan²x = 1. Therefore, sec x - tan x = 1/(sec x + tan x) = 7/22.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nsec x + tan x = 22/7\n\nsec x - tan x = 7/22\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2 sec x = 22/7 + 7/22 = (22² + 7²)/ (7*22) = (484 + 49)/154 = 533/154\n\nTherefore, sec x = 533/308, so cos x = 308/533. Which matches what I found earlier. Then subtracting the two equations:\n\n(sec x + tan x) - (sec x - tan x) = 2 tan x = 22/7 - 7/22 = same as above, but let me check:\n\n2 tan x = 22/7 - 7/22 = (22² - 7²)/ (7*22) = (484 - 49)/154 = 435/154\n\nTherefore tan x = 435/308. Since tan x = sin x / cos x, and we have cos x = 308/533, then sin x = tan x * cos x = (435/308)*(308/533) = 435/533. Which matches my previous result. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, sin x = 435/533, cos x = 308/533. Therefore, csc x + cot x = 1/sin x + cos x / sin x = (1 + cos x)/sin x = (1 + 308/533)/ (435/533) = (841/533)/(435/533) = 841/435 = 29/15. So same result. Therefore, m + n is 29 + 15 = 44. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 44. But let me check once more if there's a possibility I messed up with signs? Because depending on the quadrant of x, sec x + tan x could be positive or negative. But since they gave sec x + tan x = 22/7 which is positive, so x must be in a quadrant where sec x and tan x are both positive or both negative. But since sec x is 1/cos x, so if cos x is positive, sec x is positive, and tan x is sin x / cos x. So if cos x is positive, then tan x is positive if sin x is positive. So x is in first quadrant. Similarly, if cos x is negative, then sec x is negative, and tan x would be negative if sin x is positive (third quadrant), but sec x + tan x would be negative + negative = negative. Since given value is positive, x is in first quadrant. Therefore, sin x and cos x are positive. Therefore, my calculations are okay. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't want to solve for sin x and cos x, maybe there's a trick to relate (1 + sin x)/cos x and (1 + cos x)/sin x. Let me think. Let me denote A = (1 + sin x)/cos x = 22/7, and B = (1 + cos x)/sin x. Maybe find B in terms of A?\n\nLet me try squaring A:\n\nA² = (1 + sin x)² / cos²x = (1 + 2 sin x + sin²x)/cos²x. Since cos²x = 1 - sin²x, so substituting:\n\n(1 + 2 sin x + sin²x)/(1 - sin²x) = [ (1 + sin x)^2 ] / [ (1 - sin x)(1 + sin x) ] = (1 + sin x)/(1 - sin x)\n\nTherefore, A² = (1 + sin x)/(1 - sin x). Therefore, solving for sin x?\n\nAlternatively, maybe relate A and B through some identity. Let me see:\n\nIf A = (1 + sin x)/cos x, then 1/A = cos x / (1 + sin x). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 - sin x:\n\n[cos x (1 - sin x)] / [ (1 + sin x)(1 - sin x) ] = [cos x (1 - sin x)] / (1 - sin²x) = [cos x (1 - sin x)] / cos²x = (1 - sin x)/cos x. \n\nTherefore, 1/A = (1 - sin x)/cos x. Which is equal to sec x - tan x, since sec x - tan x = 1/cos x - sin x / cos x = (1 - sin x)/cos x. Which we already knew earlier. \n\nBut how does this help with B?\n\nB = (1 + cos x)/sin x. Maybe do similar trick. Let me compute 1/B:\n\n1/B = sin x / (1 + cos x). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 - cos x:\n\n[sin x (1 - cos x)] / [ (1 + cos x)(1 - cos x) ] = [sin x (1 - cos x)] / (1 - cos²x) = [sin x (1 - cos x)] / sin²x = (1 - cos x)/sin x. \n\nWhich is cot(x/2). Wait, but maybe also relates to something else. Alternatively, if we can relate to A or 1/A?\n\nAlternatively, note that if we have A = (1 + sin x)/cos x and B = (1 + cos x)/sin x, perhaps we can find AB or something?\n\nLet me compute AB:\n\nAB = [(1 + sin x)/cos x] * [(1 + cos x)/sin x] = [(1 + sin x)(1 + cos x)] / (sin x cos x)\n\nLet me expand numerator:\n\n(1 + sin x)(1 + cos x) = 1 + sin x + cos x + sin x cos x\n\nTherefore, AB = [1 + sin x + cos x + sin x cos x] / (sin x cos x)\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful. Maybe another approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since I already found that A = 22/7, and from earlier steps, we found that 1/A = 7/22 = sec x - tan x. Maybe if I can find B and 1/B?\n\nAlternatively, since I already solved the problem through solving for sin x and cos x, and verified through two different methods, and both lead to 29/15, so m + n = 44. Maybe that's the answer. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me check with actual numbers. Let me compute sin x = 435/533 ≈ let me compute decimal value. \n\nFirst, 533 is approximately 533. Let me compute 435 divided by 533. Let me approximate:\n\nWell, 435/533 ≈ 0.816. Let me check 0.816 * 533 ≈ 0.8*533 + 0.016*533 ≈ 426.4 + 8.528 ≈ 434.928, which is close to 435, so sin x ≈ 0.816. Similarly, cos x = 308/533 ≈ 0.578. Let me check 0.578 * 533 ≈ 0.5*533 + 0.078*533 ≈ 266.5 + 41.574 ≈ 308.074, which is close to 308, so cos x ≈ 0.578. \n\nLet me check if sec x + tan x ≈ 1/0.578 + 0.816 / 0.578. Let me compute:\n\n1 / 0.578 ≈ 1.73. 0.816 / 0.578 ≈ 1.412. Adding them together ≈ 1.73 + 1.412 ≈ 3.14. Now 22/7 ≈ 3.1428..., so yes, that's very close. Therefore, my values for sin x and cos x are correct. \n\nThen csc x + cot x = 1/sin x + cos x / sin x = (1 + cos x)/sin x ≈ (1 + 0.578)/0.816 ≈ 1.578 / 0.816 ≈ 1.934. Now 29/15 is approximately 1.933..., which matches. Therefore, my answer is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 44.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{44}\n</think>"}
