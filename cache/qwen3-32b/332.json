This wave carries energy from the point of impact toward the shore. As the wave travels through the water, several factors can influence how its energy is distributed and perceived.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding Wave Energy\n\nThe energy of a wave is primarily determined by two key characteristics:\n\n1. **Amplitude**: The height of the wave from its equilibrium position to its crest. Higher amplitude corresponds to greater energy.\n2. **Frequency**: The number of wave cycles that pass a point in a given time. Higher frequency also contributes to greater energy.\n\nIn general, the **energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude**. This means that even a small decrease in amplitude can result in a significant reduction in the energy carried by the wave.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n- **Option A: The wave is moving more slowly**  \n  The speed of a wave in water is influenced by the depth of the water and the properties of the medium. While a slower wave might occur as it reaches shallow water, this does not directly indicate a decrease in energy. In fact, waves can slow down while still maintaining or even increasing their energy density (e.g., as they approach the shore).\n\n- **Option B: The wave pulse’s width has become greater**  \n  A wider pulse might suggest that the wave’s energy is being spread out over a larger area. However, this does not necessarily mean that the **total** energy has decreased. It could be a result of the wave's natural dispersion or the geometry of the pond, not a loss of energy.\n\n- **Option C: The wave pulse’s width has become smaller**  \n  A narrower pulse could suggest that energy is more concentrated, which might actually indicate **more** energy in that localized area. This is not consistent with the idea of the wave losing energy.\n\n- **Option D: The wave’s height has become smaller**  \n  Since wave energy is closely tied to amplitude (i.e., height), a reduction in height is a **direct and clear indication** that the wave carries less energy. As the wave travels from the point of impact to the shore, it loses energy due to factors such as friction and spreading out. This energy loss is best observed through a decrease in wave height.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong the given choices, **the decrease in wave height** is the most direct and observable evidence that the wave has lost energy since its creation. This is because the energy of a wave is most closely related to its amplitude.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which observation shows that the wave hitting the child's ankles has less energy than when it was first created by the rock. Let me start by recalling some basic wave properties. \n\nWhen a rock hits the pond, it creates a wave. The energy from the rock's impact is transferred into the wave. As the wave travels across the pond towards the shore, something happens to its energy. I remember that in real life, waves tend to lose energy as they travel through a medium. This is due to things like friction with the water molecules, and maybe some energy being spread out over a larger area as the wave moves away from the source.\n\nSo the question is asking which of the given options indicates that the wave has less energy now. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA: The wave is moving more slowly.\nB: The wave pulse’s width has become greater.\nC: The wave pulse’s width has become smaller.\nD: The wave’s height has become smaller.\n\nHmm. I need to think about how each of these factors relates to the energy of the wave. \n\nFirst, I recall that the energy of a wave is related to its amplitude and frequency. For a wave on water, the amplitude is the height of the wave. Higher amplitude means more energy. So if the wave's height (amplitude) decreases, that would mean it has less energy. That makes option D a possible correct answer. But let me check the others.\n\nOption A: If the wave is moving more slowly, does that mean it has less energy? Well, the speed of a wave in a given medium is usually determined by the properties of the medium, like water depth and surface tension. However, if the wave is moving into shallower water near the shore, its speed might decrease. But does a slower speed directly relate to less energy? I think the energy is more about the amplitude and frequency. So maybe the speed isn't directly tied to energy in this context. Unless the question is considering that if the wave is slower, it's because it's lost energy. But I'm not sure. Maybe in some cases, but I think the primary indicators of energy are amplitude and maybe wavelength.\n\nOption B: The wave pulse’s width has become greater. If the pulse is wider, does that mean the energy is spread out more? If the same amount of energy is spread over a wider area, then the amplitude (height) might decrease. But does a wider pulse mean less energy? Not necessarily. If the energy is spread out, the intensity (energy per unit area) decreases, but the total energy might still be the same unless there's some loss. However, in reality, waves do lose energy as they travel, so maybe the width increasing is due to dispersion or something else. I'm not sure. Maybe if the pulse is wider, it's because the wave has lost some energy and spread out, but I need to think more.\n\nOption C: The wave pulse’s width has become smaller. If the width is smaller, that might mean the wave is more focused, but if it's moving into shallower water, sometimes waves get shorter in wavelength. But I'm not sure how that relates to energy. If the pulse is narrower, maybe the amplitude increases? But the question is about the wave having less energy. So if the width is smaller, but the amplitude is also smaller, then maybe the energy is less. But I need to think about how width and height relate to energy.\n\nLet me get back to the basics. The energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude. So if the height (amplitude) decreases, the energy decreases. So if the wave's height is smaller when it reaches the child, that's direct evidence that it has less energy. So option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if the other options could be correct. For example, if the wave is moving more slowly (option A), does that indicate less energy? In some contexts, the energy of a wave is related to its speed. For example, the power (energy per unit time) of a wave can be calculated using formulas that involve speed, amplitude, and frequency. But if the wave is moving slower, but maybe the amplitude is the same, the total energy might not necessarily be less. However, in reality, as a wave travels, it does lose energy, so both speed and amplitude could change. But I think in shallow water, the speed of a wave decreases as the water becomes shallower. However, in this case, the wave is moving from the center of the pond to the shore, so it's moving into shallower water. But the question is about the energy carried by the wave. If the wave is slower, but maybe the amplitude is higher? Or lower? \n\nWait, when a wave moves into shallower water, its speed decreases and its wavelength decreases, but the amplitude can increase because the same amount of energy is compressed into a shorter wavelength. However, this is more for waves approaching the shore where the depth decreases gradually. But in this case, the wave is losing energy due to friction and spreading out. So even if the wave is slowing down because of shallower water, the main factor indicating energy loss would be the amplitude (height) decreasing. \n\nSo option D, the wave's height becoming smaller, is the best indicator that the wave has less energy. \n\nOptions B and C about the width: if the pulse is wider, that might mean the energy is spread out more, so the amplitude is lower. But the total energy might still be the same if there's no loss. However, in reality, there is energy loss, so the amplitude would decrease. The width might increase due to dispersion, but that's not directly about energy. The key is that energy is related to amplitude squared. So if the height is smaller, that's direct evidence of less energy. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
