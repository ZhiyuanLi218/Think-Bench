How far will it fall during the next second of time? The options are A: h, B: 2h, C: 3h, D: 4h. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, first, when an object is released from rest and falls under gravity, assuming no air resistance, it's in free fall. The motion here is uniformly accelerated because the acceleration due to gravity is constant (approximately 9.8 m/s² near the Earth's surface). So, the equations of motion for constant acceleration should apply here.\n\nThe question is about the distance fallen during the first second and then during the next second. The key here is that the object is accelerating, so it's not moving at a constant speed. That means the distance it falls each second will increase over time because its speed is increasing.\n\nLet me recall the kinematic equations. The distance fallen under constant acceleration starting from rest is given by:\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at²\n\nWhere:\n- s is the distance fallen\n- u is the initial velocity\n- a is the acceleration\n- t is the time\n\nSince the object is released from rest, u = 0. So the equation simplifies to:\n\ns = (1/2)at²\n\nIn this problem, the acceleration a is due to gravity, which I can denote as g. So:\n\ns = (1/2)gt²\n\nNow, they say that during the first second (t = 1s), the object falls a distance h. Let me write that down:\n\nh = (1/2)g(1)² = (1/2)g\n\nTherefore, h = g/2. That means if I solve for g, g = 2h. Interesting. So the acceleration due to gravity in terms of h is twice h. But I don't know the actual value of h or g here; I just need to relate the distances.\n\nNow, the question is asking how far it will fall during the next second, which is from t = 1s to t = 2s. To find the distance fallen during that second, I need to calculate the total distance fallen in 2 seconds and subtract the distance fallen in the first second (which is h). That will give me the distance fallen specifically during the second second (the time interval from 1s to 2s).\n\nSo let me calculate the total distance fallen in 2 seconds:\n\ns_total_at_2s = (1/2)g(2)² = (1/2)g(4) = 2g\n\nBut earlier, we found that h = g/2, so substituting g = 2h into the equation:\n\ns_total_at_2s = 2*(2h) = 4h\n\nTherefore, the total distance fallen in 2 seconds is 4h. But the distance fallen during the second second (from t=1s to t=2s) is the total at 2s minus the total at 1s:\n\nDistance during second second = s_total_at_2s - h = 4h - h = 3h\n\nSo according to this, the answer should be C: 3h.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. Let me verify step by step.\n\nFirst, h = (1/2)g*(1)^2 => h = g/2. Correct.\n\nThen, total distance after 2 seconds is (1/2)g*(2)^2 = (1/2)g*4 = 2g. Then substituting g = 2h, we get 2*(2h) = 4h. So yes, 4h total after 2 seconds. Subtract the first second's distance h, gives 3h. So yes, 3h. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the distance fallen during the second second using another method to confirm.\n\nAnother approach: The distance fallen during a time interval can also be calculated by finding the average velocity during that interval multiplied by the time. Since the acceleration is constant, the velocity is changing linearly, so the average velocity during any time interval is (initial velocity + final velocity)/2.\n\nLet me try that for the second second (from t=1s to t=2s).\n\nFirst, find the velocity at t=1s and t=2s.\n\nVelocity at time t is given by v = u + at. Since u=0, v = gt.\n\nAt t=1s: v1 = g*1 = g\n\nAt t=2s: v2 = g*2 = 2g\n\nAverage velocity during the second second is (v1 + v2)/2 = (g + 2g)/2 = 3g/2\n\nThen, distance fallen during that second is average velocity * time interval = (3g/2) * 1s = 3g/2\n\nBut earlier, we had h = g/2. Therefore, substituting g = 2h:\n\nDistance = 3*(2h)/2 = 3h. Same result. So that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for displacement during the nth second. Wait, there's a formula for the distance traveled during the nth second of motion. Let me recall that.\n\nThe formula is: s_n = u + (1/2)a(2n - 1)\n\nWait, no, that formula is when you have initial velocity. Wait, more accurately, the distance traveled during the nth second (i.e., between time t = n-1 and t = n) is given by:\n\ns_n = u + a(n - 0.5)\n\nWait, maybe I need to derive it. Let me think.\n\nThe displacement after n seconds is s(n) = (1/2) a n²\n\nThe displacement after (n-1) seconds is s(n-1) = (1/2)a(n - 1)²\n\nTherefore, the displacement during the nth second is s(n) - s(n-1) = (1/2)a[n² - (n - 1)²] = (1/2)a[n² - (n² - 2n + 1)] = (1/2)a(2n - 1)\n\nTherefore, displacement during the nth second is (1/2)a(2n - 1)\n\nIn this problem, the first second (n=1): displacement is (1/2)a(2*1 -1 ) = (1/2)a(1) = a/2. Which matches our original equation since s = (1/2) a t², at t=1, s = a/2. So that checks out.\n\nThen, during the second second (n=2), displacement is (1/2)a(2*2 -1 ) = (1/2)a(3) = (3/2)a.\n\nSo the ratio between the displacement during the second second and the first second is (3/2 a) / (1/2 a) ) = 3. Therefore, the displacement during the second second is 3 times the displacement during the first second. Since the first second displacement is h, the second second displacement is 3h. Therefore, answer C: 3h.\n\nThis is another confirmation. So regardless of the method, the answer is 3h.\n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. Let me plug in real values for gravity and see.\n\nSuppose g = 9.8 m/s². Then h, the distance fallen in the first second, is (1/2)*9.8*(1)^2 = 4.9 meters. Therefore, h = 4.9 m.\n\nThen, total distance after 2 seconds is (1/2)*9.8*(2)^2 = 0.5*9.8*4 = 19.6 meters.\n\nTherefore, the distance fallen during the second second is 19.6 - 4.9 = 14.7 meters.\n\nNow, 3h would be 3*4.9 = 14.7 meters. Which matches. Therefore, the answer is indeed 3h.\n\nAlternatively, 4h would be 19.6 meters, which is the total distance after two seconds. But the question asks for the distance during the next second, which is the second second, so 14.7 m, which is 3h. So answer C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 3h.\n\nBut just to make sure there isn't any trick in the question. The problem says \"an object is released from rest and falls a distance h during the first second of time.\" So h is the distance fallen in the first second, which we've accounted for. Then asks how far it falls during the next second. So from t=1 to t=2. All our calculations confirm 3h. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way someone might get confused is if they think that since it's accelerating, maybe each second it falls more distance. For example, first second h, second second 3h, third second 5h, etc., following the odd number pattern. Which is exactly what we saw here. The distances fallen each second increase by 2h each time. So first second h, second 3h, third 5h, etc. So total after three seconds would be h + 3h +5h= 9h, which would be (1/2)g(3)^2 = 4.5g. Since h = g/2, then 4.5g = 9*(g/2) = 9h. Yep, that works. So that pattern holds. Therefore, in the second second, it's 3h. So answer C.\n\nAlternatively, someone might mistakenly think that since the acceleration is constant, the velocity is increasing linearly, so maybe the distance fallen each second increases linearly. But that's not the case because distance depends on the integral of velocity over time. Since velocity is increasing, the distance fallen each second will actually increase quadratically, but when you take the difference between each second, it ends up being linear in terms of the second number, but relative to the first second, it's multiples of h.\n\nBut in any case, all methods point to 3h. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
