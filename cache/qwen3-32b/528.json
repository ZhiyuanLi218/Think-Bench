So, there's a particle moving in a curvilinear path, which means it's not moving in a straight line. The problem says its speed increases from v to 2v in the first period and then from 2v to 5v in the next period. We need to find the relationship between the work done (W1 and W2) and the impulse (I1 and I2) in these two periods. The options are given, so I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me recall some physics concepts. Work done on an object is related to the change in kinetic energy, right? That's the work-energy theorem. So, the net work done should equal the change in kinetic energy. Impulse, on the other hand, is related to the change in momentum. The impulse-momentum theorem states that the net impulse is equal to the change in momentum.\n\nLet me write down the formulas:\n\nFor work:\nW = ΔKE = (1/2)mv²_final - (1/2)mv²_initial\n\nFor impulse:\nI = Δp = m(v_final - v_initial)\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"net work done by external forces\" and \"net impulse\". So, those should indeed correspond to the work-energy theorem and impulse-momentum theorem.\n\nSo, let's compute W1 and W2 first.\n\nFirst period: speed increases from v to 2v.\n\nSo, initial KE is (1/2)mv², final KE is (1/2)m(2v)² = (1/2)m*4v² = 2mv².\n\nTherefore, W1 = 2mv² - (1/2)mv² = (3/2)mv².\n\nSecond period: speed increases from 2v to 5v.\n\nInitial KE is (1/2)m(2v)² = 2mv² again, and final KE is (1/2)m(5v)² = (1/2)m*25v² = 12.5mv².\n\nTherefore, W2 = 12.5mv² - 2mv² = 10.5mv².\n\nNow, let me check what's W2 compared to W1.\n\nSince W1 is (3/2)mv², let me see how many times that is in W2.\n\nW2 / W1 = (10.5mv²) / (1.5mv²) = 10.5 / 1.5 = 7. So, W2 = 7W1. So that narrows down the options to C or D because options C and D have W2=7W1. A and B have W2=3W1, which is not the case here.\n\nNow, moving on to impulse. Let's compute I1 and I2.\n\nImpulse is the change in momentum. But here, the motion is curvilinear. Wait, does that affect anything? Momentum is a vector, so if the direction of velocity is changing, then the change in momentum depends on both magnitude and direction. However, the problem mentions \"magnitudes of the net impulse\". So, they are asking for the magnitude of the impulse, which is the magnitude of the change in momentum.\n\nBut here, the problem states that the speed increases from one value to another. However, since it's curvilinear motion, the direction of velocity is changing. However, we are only given the speeds (magnitude of velocity), not the directions. Hmm. So, how can we calculate the magnitude of impulse?\n\nWait, if we don't know the direction of velocity, we can't compute the exact vector change in momentum. However, the problem says \"the magnitudes of the net impulse\". The net impulse is equal to the change in momentum vector. The magnitude of that vector is what they are referring to.\n\nBut since we don't know the path or the direction changes, how can we determine I1 and I2?\n\nBut maybe there's something else. Let me think. The problem says \"the first period\" and \"the subsequent period\". So, each period refers to a time interval? Or is it referring to some other period? Wait, the wording is \"in the first period\" and \"in the subsequent period\". Maybe it's just two time intervals during which the speed increases from v to 2v and then from 2v to 5v. But since the motion is curvilinear, the direction is changing. However, if we don't have information about the direction, perhaps we need to consider the minimum possible impulse or something?\n\nWait, but the question says \"the following relationships certainly hold\". So, regardless of the path, which relationships must be true. Therefore, we need to find inequalities or equalities that hold no matter what the direction changes are.\n\nFor impulse, since it's the magnitude of the change in momentum, the minimum value of |Δp| would be if the velocity change is purely in the direction of motion. Whereas if the direction changes, the magnitude of Δp could be larger. For example, if the velocity vector changes direction, the change in momentum could be larger.\n\nBut since impulse is equal to the integral of force over time, which equals Δp. The magnitude of impulse is |Δp|. Therefore, if we can calculate the minimum possible value of I2 / I1, or find bounds.\n\nBut let's first calculate the change in momentum assuming that the velocity is in the same direction during each period. That would give us the minimum possible magnitude of impulse, because if the direction changes, the actual impulse could be larger.\n\nSo let's assume that during each period, the velocity is changing in magnitude but not in direction. Then:\n\nFor I1: initial momentum is mv, final is m(2v). So Δp = m(2v - v) = mv. Therefore, magnitude I1 = mv.\n\nFor I2: initial momentum is m(2v), final is m(5v). So Δp = m(5v - 2v) = 3mv. Therefore, magnitude I2 = 3mv. Therefore, in this case, I2 = 3I1.\n\nBut if the direction of velocity changes during the period, then the actual Δp could be larger. For example, if during the first period, the particle changes direction, then the change in momentum would be more than mv. However, since the problem states \"the magnitudes of the net impulse\", and we need to find relationships that certainly hold, meaning regardless of the path.\n\nTherefore, for I1: the minimum possible impulse magnitude is mv (if velocity direction doesn't change), but if direction does change, it could be larger. Similarly, for I2, the minimum is 3mv, but could be larger.\n\nTherefore, when comparing I2 and I1, since I2 is at least 3I1 (if direction doesn't change), but could be larger if direction changes. Therefore, the relationship between I2 and I1 is that I2 ≥ 3I1. Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: W2=7W1, I2 ≤ 3I1. But if I2 is at least 3I1, then this can't be. So option C would be invalid.\n\nOption D: W2=7W1, I2 ≥ I1. Wait, but according to our previous calculation, I2 is at least 3I1. So I2 ≥ 3I1, which is a stronger statement than I2 ≥ I1. Since 3I1 is bigger than I1, if I2 is ≥ 3I1, then certainly I2 ≥ I1. However, the options don't have I2 ≥ 3I1. The options are:\n\nA: W2=3W1, I2 ≤ 3I1\n\nB: W2=3W1, I2 ≥ I1\n\nC: W2=7W1, I2 ≤ 3I1\n\nD: W2=7W1, I2 ≥ I1\n\nSo, since we have W2=7W1, so options C and D. For impulse, since I2 is at least 3I1, then I2 must be ≥ 3I1. However, none of the options state that. Option D says I2 ≥ I1, which is certainly true because I2 ≥ 3I1 implies I2 ≥ I1. But is there a possibility that maybe the answer expects us to think that I2 could be less than 3I1? Wait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says \"the magnitudes of the net impulse are I1 and I2 respectively\". So, net impulse is the integral of net force over time. The magnitude of that impulse is equal to the magnitude of the change in momentum. However, if the direction of velocity changes during the motion, then the change in momentum vector could be less than the difference in magnitudes? Wait, no. Because momentum is a vector. Let me think with an example.\n\nSuppose in the first period, the particle starts with velocity v in some direction, and ends with velocity 2v in a different direction. The change in momentum would be Δp = m(v_final - v_initial). The magnitude of that depends on the angle between the initial and final velocities.\n\nFor example, if the particle turns around, going from velocity v to -v, then Δp would be m(-v - v) = -2mv, magnitude 2mv. But if it just speeds up in the same direction, Δp is mv. So depending on direction, the magnitude can be more or less?\n\nWait, hold on. If the speed increases from v to 2v, but the direction changes, can the magnitude of Δp be less than if the direction didn't change? Let me check with vectors.\n\nLet me consider initial momentum vector p1 = mv * î (unit vector in x-direction), and final momentum vector p2 = m*2v * (cosθ î + sinθ ĵ). Then Δp = p2 - p1. The magnitude squared would be |Δp|² = [2mv cosθ - mv]^2 + [2mv sinθ]^2 = m²v² [ (2cosθ - 1)^2 + (2 sinθ)^2 ].\n\nExpanding that:\n\n(4cos²θ - 4cosθ + 1) + 4sin²θ = 4(cos²θ + sin²θ) - 4cosθ + 1 = 4(1) - 4cosθ + 1 = 5 - 4cosθ.\n\nTherefore, |Δp| = mv * sqrt(5 - 4cosθ).\n\nNow, cosθ ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, 5 - 4cosθ ranges from 5 - 4(1) = 1 to 5 - 4(-1) = 9. Therefore, sqrt(5 - 4cosθ) ranges from 1 to 3. Therefore, |Δp| ranges from mv*1 to mv*3. Therefore, the magnitude of impulse I1 can be between mv and 3mv. Wait, but in the first period, the speed increases from v to 2v. But here, if the direction changes, the speed is the magnitude of the velocity. So, in this example, the initial speed is v, and the final speed is 2v. Therefore, the example is valid. Therefore, the magnitude of the impulse I1 can be between mv and 3mv. Similarly for I2.\n\nTherefore, for I1, the minimum is mv, maximum is 3mv. Similarly, for I2, when speed increases from 2v to 5v, let's do similar analysis.\n\nLet me consider initial momentum p_initial = m*2v * î, and final momentum p_final = m*5v * (cosθ î + sinθ ĵ). Then Δp = p_final - p_initial. The magnitude squared:\n\n|Δp|² = [5mv cosθ - 2mv]^2 + [5mv sinθ]^2 = m²v² [ (5cosθ - 2)^2 + (5 sinθ)^2 ]\n\nExpanding:\n\n(25cos²θ - 20cosθ + 4) + 25 sin²θ = 25(cos²θ + sin²θ) - 20cosθ + 4 = 25(1) - 20cosθ + 4 = 29 - 20cosθ.\n\nTherefore, |Δp| = mv*sqrt(29 - 20cosθ). Now cosθ ranges from -1 to 1, so 29 - 20cosθ ranges from 29 - 20(1) = 9 to 29 - 20(-1) = 49. Therefore sqrt(...) ranges from 3 to 7. Therefore, |Δp| ranges from 3mv to 7mv. Therefore, the magnitude of impulse I2 is between 3mv and 7mv.\n\nSo, for I1, it's between mv and 3mv, and for I2, between 3mv and 7mv. Now, the question is about the relationship between I2 and I1. The problem says \"the following relationships certainly hold\". So, regardless of what the actual paths are (i.e., regardless of θ in our examples), which of the options must be true.\n\nLooking at option C: I2 ≤ 3I1. Let's check if that's always true. Suppose I1 is at its minimum (mv), then 3I1 is 3mv. But I2 can be as high as 7mv, which is greater than 3mv. Therefore, C is not necessarily true. Similarly, option D says I2 ≥ I1. Let's check if that's always true. Since I2 is at least 3mv and I1 is at most 3mv. Therefore, the minimum I2 is 3mv, and the maximum I1 is 3mv. Therefore, I2 ≥ I1 always holds. Because even if I1 is maximum (3mv) and I2 is minimum (3mv), they are equal. If I1 is less than 3mv, then since I2 is at least 3mv, I2 will be greater than I1. Therefore, I2 ≥ I1 certainly holds. Also, note that option D says I2 ≥ I1, which is true. However, what about option B? It says W2=3W1 and I2 ≥ I1, but we already saw that W2=7W1, so B is invalid. Option D is the one with W2=7W1 and I2 ≥ I1, so D is correct.\n\nBut let me check again. Let me take some numbers. Suppose in the first period, the direction doesn't change. Then I1 = mv. In the second period, direction doesn't change, so I2 = 3mv. Then I2 = 3I1, which satisfies I2 ≥ I1. If in the first period, direction changes so that I1 is maximum, which is 3mv. Then I2 is at minimum 3mv. So I2 ≥ I1 would mean 3mv ≥ 3mv, which is true. If in the first period, I1 is something in between, say 2mv, then since I2 is at least 3mv, then 3mv ≥ 2mv, which is true. Therefore, regardless of the actual paths, I2 is always greater or equal to I1. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any scenario where I2 could be less than I1. Suppose I1 is maximum (3mv) and I2 is minimum (3mv). Then they are equal. If I1 is maximum (3mv) and I2 is something less than I1? But I2 cannot be less than 3mv. Because I2 is between 3mv and 7mv. Therefore, I2 can't be less than 3mv. Therefore, even if I1 is maximum 3mv, I2 is at least equal. Therefore, I2 ≥ I1 always. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another perspective. For example, maybe the time intervals are the same? Wait, the problem says \"in the first period and from 2v to 5v in the subsequent period\". The term \"period\" here is a bit ambiguous. In physics, a period usually refers to the time it takes to complete a cycle, but since it's curvilinear motion, maybe it's not a periodic motion. The problem might be using \"period\" to mean \"time interval\". But if the two periods are the same duration, then maybe we can relate impulse and work differently? But the problem does not specify anything about time, so we can't assume that. The work done depends on the path and the forces, but since we used the work-energy theorem, which doesn't depend on path, only on initial and final speeds. Therefore, our calculation for W1 and W2 is okay. For impulse, since it's the change in momentum, which depends on velocities (vectors), but since we are given only speeds, we have to consider the possible range of impulse magnitudes.\n\nTherefore, given that, the answer is D: W2=7W1 and I2 ≥ I1.\n\nBut let me check again the options. The options are:\n\n(A) W2 = 3W1, I2 ≤ 3I1\n\n(B) W2 = 3W1, I2 ≥ I1\n\n(C) W2 = 7W1, I2 ≤ 3I1\n\n(D) W2 = 7W1, I2 ≥ I1\n\nYes, so D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
