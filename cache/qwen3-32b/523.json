I need to find the position of the body at t = 11 seconds. The problem says that the body is moving in the positive x-direction and passes the origin at t = 0. From t = 0 to t = 1 second, it has a constant speed of 24 m/s. Then, at t = 1 second, it starts to have a constant acceleration of 6 m/s² in the negative x direction. So, I need to figure out where it is at t = 11 s. The options are A: 99m, B: 36m, C: -36m, D: -99m. Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, from t = 0 to t = 1 s, the body is moving at a constant speed of 24 m/s. Since it's moving at a constant speed, there's no acceleration during this interval. So, I can calculate the position at t = 1 s by using the formula for constant velocity motion: x = x₀ + v*t. Here, x₀ is the initial position, which is 0 because it passes the origin at t = 0. The velocity v is 24 m/s, and the time t is 1 second. So, x at t = 1 s is 0 + 24*1 = 24 meters. So, at t = 1 s, the body is at 24 m.\n\nNow, starting at t = 1 s, the body is given a constant acceleration of -6 m/s² (since it's in the negative x direction). So, from t = 1 s to t = 11 s, the body is accelerating at -6 m/s². Wait, but what is the initial velocity at t = 1 s? Since before that, it was moving at a constant speed of 24 m/s, so at t = 1 s, right before the acceleration is applied, the velocity is still 24 m/s. Then, when the acceleration is applied, does the velocity change instantaneously? No, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, so the velocity will start changing from 24 m/s at t = 1 s onwards. So, for the motion after t = 1 s, we need to consider the initial velocity as 24 m/s, initial position as 24 m, and acceleration of -6 m/s². The time interval here is from t = 1 s to t = 11 s, which is 10 seconds. So, we need to calculate the position at t = 11 s based on that.\n\nSo, the formula for position with constant acceleration is x = x₀ + v₀*t + 0.5*a*t². But here, t is the time elapsed since t = 1 s, which is 10 seconds. Let me confirm: the total time from t = 0 to t = 11 s is 11 seconds, but the acceleration is only applied from t = 1 s onward, so the time under acceleration is 11 - 1 = 10 seconds. Therefore, using that time in the equation.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: x₀ is 24 m (position at t = 1 s), v₀ is 24 m/s (velocity at t = 1 s), a is -6 m/s², and t is 10 s. Therefore, x = 24 + 24*10 + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2. Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 24 m. Second term: 24*10 = 240 m. Third term: 0.5*(-6)*(100) = 0.5*(-600) = -300 m. Adding them all together: 24 + 240 - 300. Let's see, 24 + 240 is 264, and 264 - 300 is -36 m. So, the position at t = 11 s is -36 m? But wait, that would be option C. Hmm. But let me check my calculations again to make sure.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the time interval or the initial position. Let me go through again.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1 s: x1 = 24 m/s * 1 s = 24 m. Correct.\n\nFrom t=1 s to t=11 s: time elapsed is 10 s. The initial velocity at t=1 s is 24 m/s. Acceleration is -6 m/s². So displacement during this time is:\n\ns = ut + 0.5*a*t² = 24*10 + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2 = 240 + 0.5*(-6)*100 = 240 - 300 = -60 m. Then, total displacement from t=0 to t=11 s is x1 + s = 24 + (-60) = -36 m. So yes, that gives -36 m. So option C.\n\nBut wait, the answer options include -36 m as option C. So according to this, the answer should be C. But let me check again. Maybe I missed something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the entire duration from t=0 to t=11 s, considering different phases. Wait, but from t=0 to t=1 s, acceleration is zero, so motion is uniform. Then from t=1 to t=11 s, acceleration is -6 m/s². So the total displacement is displacement from first interval plus displacement from second interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the velocity at t=11 s and then use another formula? Wait, no, since we need position, the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's compute velocity as a function of time.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1 s, velocity is 24 m/s. At t=1 s, acceleration is applied. So velocity at any time t ≥ 1 s is v(t) = v(1) + a*(t - 1). So v(t) = 24 + (-6)*(t - 1). So, for example, at t=1 s, velocity is 24 m/s. Then, velocity decreases by 6 m/s every second.\n\nIf I wanted to find the position, I can integrate velocity over time from t=1 to t=11, and add it to the position at t=1 s.\n\nSo position at t=11 s is x(1) + integral from 1 to 11 of v(t) dt.\n\nWhich is 24 + integral from 1 to 11 [24 - 6(t - 1)] dt.\n\nLet me compute that integral. Let me make substitution: let τ = t - 1, so when t=1, τ=0; when t=11, τ=10. Then integral becomes integral from τ=0 to τ=10 [24 - 6τ] dτ.\n\nIntegrate term by term:\n\nIntegral of 24 dτ is 24τ.\n\nIntegral of -6τ dτ is -3τ².\n\nSo total integral is [24τ - 3τ²] from 0 to 10. At τ=10: 24*10 - 3*(10)^2 = 240 - 300 = -60. At τ=0, it's 0. So integral is -60. Therefore, position at t=11 is 24 + (-60) = -36 m. Same result as before. So that seems to confirm it. So answer is C: -36 m.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A:99, B:36, C:-36, D:-99. So according to this, answer is C. But maybe I made a mistake in the sign of acceleration?\n\nWait, acceleration is in the negative x direction, so it's -6 m/s². So when I calculated the displacement from t=1 to t=11, I used -6 m/s². That seems correct. Let me check the calculation once again.\n\ns = ut + 0.5*a*t². u = 24 m/s, a = -6 m/s², t=10 s.\n\ns = 24*10 + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2 = 240 + (-3)*100 = 240 - 300 = -60 m. Then total position is 24 + (-60) = -36 m. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the entire motion from t=0 to t=11 s with piecewise functions. Let me try that approach.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1 s: x(t) = 24t.\n\nAt t=1 s, x(1) = 24 m. Now, for t ≥ 1 s, the acceleration is -6 m/s². So we need to define the position function for t ≥ 1 s. The initial velocity at t=1 s is 24 m/s, and initial position is 24 m. So for t ≥ 1, the position is:\n\nx(t) = x(1) + v(1)*(t - 1) + 0.5*a*(t - 1)^2.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. So plugging t=11:\n\nx(11) = 24 + 24*(11 - 1) + 0.5*(-6)*(11 - 1)^2.\n\nWait, hold on, here (t - 1) is 10 s. So same calculation as before. So 24 + 24*10 - 3*(10)^2 = 24 + 240 - 300 = -36 m. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to model the entire motion with different equations? For example, maybe considering that after t=1 s, the velocity is changing, so we can find when it stops or something? Wait, but the question is just asking for position at t=11 s. Let me check if during the 10 seconds from t=1 to t=11, the body changes direction. Maybe that affects the displacement?\n\nLet me find the time when velocity becomes zero. Velocity as a function of time for t ≥ 1 s is v(t) = 24 - 6*(t - 1). Set to zero:\n\n0 = 24 - 6*(t - 1)\n\n=> 6*(t - 1) = 24\n\n=> t - 1 = 4\n\n=> t = 5 s.\n\nSo at t=5 s, the body comes to rest momentarily. After that, it starts moving in the negative x direction. So between t=1 s and t=5 s, it's moving in positive x direction but decelerating, and from t=5 s onward, it's accelerating in the negative x direction.\n\nSo maybe I can compute the displacement from t=1 to t=5, and then from t=5 to t=11, and add them up?\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, from t=1 to t=5 s:\n\nTime interval is 4 seconds. Initial velocity is 24 m/s, acceleration is -6 m/s². The displacement here can be calculated by:\n\ns1 = ut + 0.5*a*t² = 24*4 + 0.5*(-6)*(4)^2 = 96 + 0.5*(-6)*16 = 96 - 48 = 48 m.\n\nAlternatively, since it comes to rest at t=5 s, we can also calculate the distance using average velocity. Since initial velocity is 24 m/s and final velocity is 0, average velocity is (24 + 0)/2 = 12 m/s over 4 seconds, so displacement is 12*4 = 48 m. Same result.\n\nThen, from t=5 s to t=11 s, which is 6 seconds. Now, the body is moving in the negative x direction with initial velocity 0 (at t=5 s) and acceleration -6 m/s². Wait, acceleration is still -6 m/s². Wait, acceleration is constant, so even after the body stops, it continues to accelerate in the negative direction. So initial velocity at t=5 s is 0, acceleration is -6 m/s², time is 6 seconds. So displacement here is:\n\ns2 = ut + 0.5*a*t² = 0*6 + 0.5*(-6)*(6)^2 = 0 + 0.5*(-6)*36 = -108 m.\n\nTherefore, total displacement from t=1 to t=11 is s1 + s2 = 48 + (-108) = -60 m. Then, adding to the initial position at t=1 s (24 m), total position at t=11 s is 24 + (-60) = -36 m. Same result. So that's consistent.\n\nSo regardless of the method, I get -36 m. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and perhaps get a different answer, maybe due to miscalculating the time intervals or acceleration sign.\n\nFor example, someone might think that the acceleration is applied from t=0, but no, the problem says between t=0 and t=1, constant speed, so acceleration is zero there. Then at t=1, acceleration is applied. Another possible mistake is mixing up the time intervals. For example, if someone thought that from t=0 to t=11, the acceleration is applied after t=1, but miscalculates the time as 11 seconds instead of 10. Let's see what would happen if someone used t=11 instead of 10 in the second part.\n\nIf they did x = 24 + 24*11 + 0.5*(-6)*(11)^2. Let's compute that:\n\n24 + 264 - 0.5*6*121 = 288 - 3*121 = 288 - 363 = -75 m. Not one of the options. So that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, if someone forgot to add the initial position at t=1 s, and just calculated displacement from t=1 to t=11 as -60 m, but then thought that's the total displacement from origin. But no, because the displacement from t=0 to t=1 is +24 m, then from t=1 to t=11 is -60 m, so total is -36 m.\n\nAnother possible mistake: miscalculating the acceleration sign. If someone took acceleration as positive 6 m/s², then displacement from t=1 to t=11 would be 24 + 24*10 + 0.5*6*100 = 24 + 240 + 300 = 564 m. Total position would be 564 + 24? Wait no, that formula already includes the initial position. Wait no, the formula x = x₀ + v₀*t + 0.5*a*t². If someone used positive 6, then x = 24 + 24*10 + 0.5*6*100 = 24 + 240 + 300 = 564 m. Which is way higher than the options given. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the acceleration starts at t=0. But no, the problem says between t=0 and t=1, constant speed. So acceleration is zero there.\n\nAnother possible error: mixing up velocity and speed. But in this case, speed is given as 24 m/s, but since it's moving in positive x direction, velocity is also +24 m/s. So no issue there.\n\nAlternatively, someone might miscalculate the integral or the displacement. But as I did it multiple ways, all leading to -36 m, which is option C. So unless there's some other factor I'm missing, like maybe the question is in different units or something? But the problem states meters and seconds, so units are consistent.\n\nWait, let me check the arithmetic again. From t=1 to t=11, displacement is -60 m. Adding to the 24 m from first interval: 24 - 60 = -36 m. Yes. So answer is C.\n\nBut let me check with another formula. For example, using the equation:\n\nv² = u² + 2*a*s.\n\nBut since we have two different intervals, maybe not directly helpful. But let's see.\n\nFirst, from t=1 to t=5 s, when it comes to rest. At t=5 s, velocity is 0. So using v² = u² + 2*a*s:\n\n0² = 24² + 2*(-6)*s1 => 0 = 576 - 12*s1 => 12*s1 = 576 => s1 = 48 m. Which matches previous calculation. Then from t=5 to t=11, starting from rest, acceleration -6 m/s² for 6 seconds. So displacement is s2 = 0.5*(-6)*(6)^2 = -108 m. Total displacement from t=1: 48 - 108 = -60 m. So again, total position is 24 - 60 = -36 m. So yes, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to use average velocity or something else? For example, total distance traveled? But no, the question asks for position, which is a vector quantity, so direction matters. So even though the body might have traveled some distance forward and then backward, the position is net displacement.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The problem says \"the body is given a constant acceleration of 6 meters per second squared in the negative x direction.\" So that is -6 m/s². Correct.\n\nAnother check: what is the velocity at t=11 s?\n\nFrom earlier, velocity as a function of time for t ≥ 1 is v(t) = 24 - 6*(t - 1). At t=11, that is 24 - 6*(10) = 24 - 60 = -36 m/s. So velocity is -36 m/s at t=11 s. So the body is moving in the negative direction at that time, which makes sense because it came to rest at t=5 s and then started moving back.\n\nIf we wanted to find the position at t=11 s using another formula, maybe using the average of initial and final velocity multiplied by time? For the interval from t=1 to t=11 s.\n\nAverage velocity would be (v_initial + v_final)/2 = (24 + (-36))/2 = (-12)/2 = -6 m/s. Multiply by time (10 s): -6 * 10 = -60 m. Then total position is 24 + (-60) = -36 m. Same result again. So this is yet another method leading to the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the correct answer is C: -36 m.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other possible interpretation of the problem. For example, maybe the acceleration is applied instantaneously at t=1 s, changing the velocity? No, acceleration is a continuous thing. If there was an instantaneous change in velocity, that would be an impulse, but the problem says it's given a constant acceleration. So acceleration starts at t=1 s and is constant thereafter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in one dimension, so all the directions are accounted for with signs. Yes, positive and negative x direction.\n\nAnother possible error: miscalculating 0.5*a*t². For example, if someone thought 0.5*a is -6*0.5 = -3, then multiplied by t squared. Which is what I did. For t=10, t squared is 100, so -3*100=-300. Then adding to 24 + 240 gives 24 + 240 - 300 = -36. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone forgot the 0.5 factor, they would have done 24*10 + (-6)*100 = 240 - 600 = -360. Then total position 24 - 360 = -336 m, which is not among the options. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if someone used 6 m/s² as positive, then 0.5*6*100 = +300, so 24 + 240 + 300 = 564 m. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in different time intervals? Wait, from t=0 to t=1, then from t=1 to t=11. Total time 11 seconds. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for distance traveled instead of displacement? But the options include negative numbers, which would not make sense for distance. Since distance is scalar and non-negative, but options have negative numbers, so it's definitely asking for position, which is displacement from origin.\n\nTherefore, after multiple methods and checks, I can confirm that the position at t=11 s is -36 meters, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
