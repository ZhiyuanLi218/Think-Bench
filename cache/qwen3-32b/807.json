Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A regular heptagon has seven sides, all equal, and all internal angles equal. A square has four sides, right? So they share side AD, which means points A and D are common to both the square and the heptagon. The Asymptote code draws a heptagon and then defines points A, F, C, D, and B. From the labels, A is at the bottom, D is another vertex of the heptagon, and C is somewhere southeast. B is a vertex of the heptagon to the west of A. \n\nFirst, maybe I should recall some properties of regular heptagons. The internal angle of a regular polygon is given by the formula ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. For a heptagon, n=7, so each internal angle is ((7-2)*180)/7 = (5*180)/7 ≈ 128.57 degrees. Let me confirm that. Yeah, 5*180 is 900 divided by 7 is approximately 128.57. So each internal angle in the heptagon is 128.57 degrees. \n\nNow, since AD is a side of both the heptagon and the square, the square has sides equal in length to the sides of the heptagon. In the square, all angles are 90 degrees. The square is attached to the heptagon along AD. So, if I imagine the heptagon, and then a square sticking out from one of its sides. The square will have another side extending from D, and another from A, each perpendicular to AD. But the diagram shows points C and B. Let me try to parse the Asymptote code again. \n\nThe Asymptote code draws a regular heptagon, then defines A as the third vertex (since it's using dir(360*3/7 + 90)), F as the fourth vertex. Then C is defined as A + dir(90)*(F - A). Hmm, dir(90) is a unit vector pointing upwards (since in Asymptote, dir(theta) gives a point on the unit circle at angle theta degrees from the x-axis). So dir(90) is (0,1). So F - A is a vector from A to F. Then multiplying by dir(90) would rotate that vector 90 degrees counterclockwise? Wait, in Asymptote, multiplying by a complex number (which dir(theta) is) would rotate the vector. So if you have a vector v and multiply by dir(90), which is i in complex plane, that's a 90-degree rotation counterclockwise. But here, it's dir(90)*(F - A). Wait, if F - A is a vector, then multiplying by dir(90) would rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise? Or is it clockwise? Let me think. In complex numbers, multiplying by e^(iθ) rotates a complex number by θ radians counterclockwise. So if dir(90) is e^(iπ/2) which is i, then multiplying by dir(90) would rotate a vector 90 degrees counterclockwise. However, in Asymptote, the coordinate system has y going up, so maybe it's consistent with standard Cartesian coordinates. \n\nBut regardless, the code says C = A + dir(90)*(F - A). So starting at point A, moving in the direction of F - A rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. So if F is the next vertex after A in the heptagon, then vector AF is a side of the heptagon? Wait, no, in the heptagon, consecutive vertices are connected by sides, so if A is the third vertex and F is the fourth, then AF is a side of the heptagon. So vector AF is a side of the heptagon. Rotating that vector 90 degrees counterclockwise and adding it to A gives point C. Then D is defined as C + F - A. So starting at C, moving in the direction from A to F? Wait, F - A is the vector from A to F. So adding that to C would be moving from C in the direction of AF? Wait, maybe D is such that AD is a side of the square? Because AD is a common side. \n\nWait, the square has side AD. So in the square, AD is one side, and then the square has another side from A and another from D. So if C is connected to D, then maybe CD is another side of the square? The Asymptote code draws A--C--D--F. So A connected to C, C connected to D, D connected to F. Since AD is a common side, maybe AD is part of the square? But in the drawing, A is connected to C and D is connected to C. So triangle ACD? Wait, but if AD is a side of the square, then AC and CD should be sides of the square as well? But in a square, all sides are equal and at right angles. So if AD is a diagonal of the square? Wait, no. If AD is a side of the square, then from A, moving perpendicularly to AD would give another side of the square. \n\nBut according to the code, point C is constructed by taking vector AF (which is a side of the heptagon from A to F), rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise, and then adding that to A. So if AF is a side of the heptagon, then rotating it 90 degrees would give a direction perpendicular to AF. Since AD is a common side, maybe AF is actually AD? Wait, no. In the heptagon, A is connected to its adjacent vertices. If A is the third vertex, then the adjacent vertices would be the second and fourth. So in the code, F is the fourth vertex. Therefore, AF is a side of the heptagon. But AD? Is D the fourth vertex? Wait, in the code, D is defined as C + F - A. Then they label D as F? Wait, the label says label(\"$D$\",F,S);. Wait, in the Asymptote code, D is defined as C + F - A, but then they label the point F as D? Wait, no, the code defines pair D = C + F - A; then labels D as \"D\". But then in the label command, they have label(\"$D$\",F,S); which would label point F as D? Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me check again:\n\nOriginal Asymptote code:\n\npair A = dir(360*3/7+90);\n\npair F = dir(360*4/7+90);\n\npair C = A + dir(90)*(F - A);\n\npair D = C + F - A;\n\npair B = dir(360*2/7+90);\n\ndraw(A--C--D--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",F,S);\n\nWait, so D is defined as C + F - A, but then they label point F as D? That seems contradictory. Unless there's a typo? Or maybe D is supposed to be at the position of F? Wait, but D is defined as C + F - A. Let me think. Let me try to parse coordinates. Let me suppose that the heptagon is drawn with points labeled in order, starting from some initial direction. The Asymptote code uses dir(360*i/7 + 90), which would place the first vertex at 90 degrees (straight up), then each subsequent vertex 360/7 degrees around. So for i=0, it's 90 degrees, i=1 is 90 + 360/7, etc. So A is the third vertex, which is i=3: 90 + 360*3/7 degrees. Similarly, F is i=4: 90 + 360*4/7. Then C is constructed by taking vector from A to F, rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise, and adding to A. Then D is C + (F - A). So if I think of vectorially, starting at A, moving to C by rotating AF 90 degrees, then from C moving by vector F - A to get to D. \n\nBut if AD is supposed to be a common side between the square and heptagon, but D is labeled as F? Wait, but in the diagram, they draw A--C--D--F. So if D is C + F - A, and then they draw D--F, that would mean that from D to F is the vector F - D. But D = C + F - A, so F - D = F - (C + F - A) = A - C. So vector from D to F is A - C. \n\nBut maybe I need to think geometrically. Let me try to sketch mentally. Let me imagine a regular heptagon. Let me label its vertices as V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 going around. The Asymptote code defines A as dir(360*3/7 + 90), which would correspond to V3. Similarly, F is dir(360*4/7 + 90), so V4. Then B is dir(360*2/7 + 90), so V2. So in the heptagon, A is V3, adjacent to V2 and V4. So side V3V4 is AF (since A is V3 and F is V4). Then, constructing point C: starting at A, moving in the direction of AF rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. So if AF is a side of the heptagon going from V3 to V4, then rotating that vector 90 degrees counterclockwise would give a direction perpendicular to AF. Since AD is supposed to be a common side with the square, maybe AD is the side of the square that is also side AF of the heptagon? Wait, but AF is a side of the heptagon. However, AD is supposed to be a common side. But in the code, D is defined as C + F - A. If AD is a side of the square, then AD should be equal in length to AF, and at a right angle? Because in a square, adjacent sides are at right angles. \n\nWait, if AF is a side of the heptagon, and we rotate it 90 degrees to get AC, then AC would be a side of the square? Then CD is another side? Let me think. If we have point C constructed by rotating AF 90 degrees counterclockwise around A, then AC is equal in length to AF and perpendicular to it. Then if we go from C in the direction opposite to AF to get D such that CD is equal and parallel to AF? Wait, D is defined as C + (F - A). So vector from C to D is F - A. Since vector from A to F is F - A, so vector from C to D is same as vector from A to F. Therefore, CD is congruent and parallel to AF. Since AF is a side of the heptagon, CD is congruent to AF. Also, AC is congruent to AF because it's a rotation. Therefore, AC = CD = AD? Wait, if AD is the diagonal? Wait, no. If AC is perpendicular to AF, and CD is parallel to AF, then ACD is a right triangle? Wait, if AC is perpendicular to AF, and CD is parallel to AF, then AC is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, triangle ACD is a right triangle with legs AC and CD, both equal in length to AF (which is a side of the heptagon). Therefore, AD would be the hypotenuse of that right triangle. Therefore, AD = sqrt(AC^2 + CD^2) = sqrt(2)*AC. But in a square, all sides are equal. Wait, but AD is supposed to be a side of the square. Wait, maybe I'm confused here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the square and the regular heptagon share a common side AD. So AD is a side of both the square and the heptagon. However, according to the construction in the Asymptote code, AD is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the side length of the heptagon. Therefore, there seems to be inconsistency unless my understanding is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe AD is a side of the square, meaning that AD has the same length as the sides of the square, but the square is constructed such that AD is one side, and then the square extends outward from the heptagon. However, in the Asymptote code, they define C such that AC is a side of the square? If AD is a side of the square, then AC and CD would be other sides or diagonals?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to figure out coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to these points. Let me consider the regular heptagon inscribed in a unit circle for simplicity. Let me recall that the coordinates of the regular heptagon can be given by (cos(theta), sin(theta)) where theta = 90 + 360*i/7 degrees for i=0,...,6. \n\nSo point A is the third vertex: i=3. Therefore, theta_A = 90 + 360*3/7 degrees. Similarly, point F is i=4: theta_F = 90 + 360*4/7 degrees. Let me compute these angles numerically.\n\nFirst, 360/7 ≈ 51.4286 degrees. Therefore:\n\ntheta_A = 90 + 3*51.4286 ≈ 90 + 154.2858 ≈ 244.2858 degrees.\n\ntheta_F = 90 + 4*51.4286 ≈ 90 + 205.7144 ≈ 295.7144 degrees.\n\nSo coordinates of A: (cos(244.2858°), sin(244.2858°)).\n\nSimilarly for F: (cos(295.7144°), sin(295.7144°)).\n\nBut maybe instead of calculating exact values, which might be messy, I can use complex numbers or vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since the Asymptote code defines C as A + dir(90)*(F - A), let me think of F - A as a vector, then multiplied by dir(90) (which is a 90-degree rotation) and added to A.\n\nSo if I consider vector AF, which is F - A. Rotating that vector 90 degrees counterclockwise gives a new vector, then adding to A gives point C. So AC is that rotated vector.\n\nIn a square, adjacent sides are perpendicular. If AD is a side of the square, then from point A, moving along AD, and from point A, moving along another side perpendicular to AD. However, in this case, if we constructed AC by rotating AF 90 degrees, then AC is perpendicular to AF. If AD is supposed to be a side of the square, maybe AF is not AD? Wait, but the problem says they share side AD. So AD is a side of both the heptagon and the square. Therefore, in the heptagon, AD must be a side. But in the heptagon, consecutive vertices are connected by sides. So if A is V3, then its adjacent vertices are V2 and V4. Therefore, AD must be V3V4? But in the code, D is labeled as F, which is V4. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they label point F as D. Wait, no, in the code:\n\npair D = C + F - A;\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",F,S);\n\nSo they define D as C + F - A, but then they label the point F as D. That is, they label the original point F (which is V4) as D. Therefore, in the diagram, AD is the side from A (V3) to D (which is V4). Therefore, AD is indeed a side of the heptagon, as it connects V3 to V4. Then the square shares this side AD. Therefore, the square has vertices at A, D, and two other points. According to the drawing command A--C--D--F, which is A--C--D--F. But since D is labeled as F, maybe the square is A, C, D, and another point? Wait, the square is supposed to have four sides. The drawing shows A connected to C, C connected to D, D connected to F. But if D is actually V4 (labeled as D), then D connected to F would be D connected to... original F? But original F is V4, which is D. Wait, this is confusing because of the label. Maybe there is a typo in the Asymptote code? Or maybe I need to parse it again.\n\nOriginal Asymptote code:\n\n- The heptagon is drawn with vertices from i=0 to 7, each at dir(360*i/7 + 90). So seven vertices.\n\n- A is defined as dir(360*3/7 + 90) which is the third vertex.\n\n- F is defined as dir(360*4/7 + 90), which is the fourth vertex.\n\n- Then C is constructed as A + dir(90)*(F - A). So starting at A, moving in direction perpendicular to AF.\n\n- D is defined as C + F - A. Then they draw A--C--D--F.\n\n- They label D as F? Wait, no, label(\"$D$\",F,S);. So they take the point F (which is the fourth vertex of the heptagon) and label it as D. So in the diagram, D is actually the original point F. But then where is the original D? The code defines D as C + F - A, but then doesn't label that point. Instead, they label F as D. This seems conflicting. Maybe there is an error here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct, and D is meant to be the point C + F - A, but they mistakenly label F as D? Or maybe I need to figure out the correct positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mislabeling in the Asymptote code, but the problem says that the square and the heptagon share side AD, so maybe we can go by the problem statement rather than the Asymptote code. Let me try to focus on the problem statement: A square and a regular heptagon are coplanar and share a common side AD. What is the degree measure of angle BAC?\n\nSo, we have a regular heptagon and a square sharing side AD. Points A and D are common. Point B is another vertex of the heptagon, and point C is a vertex of the square. Need to find angle BAC.\n\nAssuming that in the heptagon, AD is a side, so A and D are adjacent vertices. Let me consider the regular heptagon. Let me label the heptagon vertices as A, B', C', D, E, F, G going around, but the problem mentions point B, which is another vertex. Wait, the problem says \"as shown\" with an Asymptote figure, but since I don't have the image, I need to rely on the code.\n\nIn the Asymptote code, B is defined as dir(360*2/7 + 90), which would be the second vertex of the heptagon. Since A is the third vertex, so moving counterclockwise, the order would be ... V2 (B), V3 (A), V4 (F, labeled as D), etc. So in the heptagon, the vertices adjacent to A are V2 (B) and V4 (D). Therefore, internal angle at A is the internal angle of the heptagon, which we calculated as approximately 128.57 degrees. \n\nNow, the square shares side AD. So starting at A, going to D, then the square extends from there. In the square, the next side from D should be perpendicular to AD. Similarly, from A, the square should have another side perpendicular to AD. But where is point C? In the Asymptote code, point C is constructed by rotating vector AF (which is AD, since F is labeled as D) 90 degrees. Wait, if AD is a side of the heptagon from A to D (which is originally F in the code), then rotating AD 90 degrees counterclockwise would give the direction of the square from A. Therefore, point C is such that AC is a side of the square, perpendicular to AD. Then the square would have vertices A, D, and then from D go in some direction, and from A go to C. But to complete the square, from C you would go parallel to AD to meet the extension from D. \n\nBut perhaps I need to find coordinates. Let me try assigning coordinates. Let me assume the regular heptagon is centered at the origin, and let me assign coordinates based on the unit circle. Let me define the vertices as V_k = (cos(theta_k), sin(theta_k)), where theta_k = 90° + 360°*k/7 for k=0,...,6.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFor k=0: theta_0 = 90° + 0 = 90°, so V0 is (0,1).\n\nk=1: theta_1 = 90° + 360/7 ≈ 90° + 51.4286° ≈ 141.4286°\n\nk=2: theta_2 ≈ 90° + 102.857° ≈ 192.857°\n\nk=3: theta_3 ≈ 90° + 154.2857° ≈ 244.2857° (point A)\n\nk=4: theta_4 ≈ 90° + 205.714° ≈ 295.714° (point F, labeled as D)\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nPoint A (V3): (cos(244.2857°), sin(244.2857°))\n\nPoint D (V4): (cos(295.714°), sin(295.714°))\n\nPoint B is V2: (cos(192.857°), sin(192.857°))\n\nNow, need to find coordinates of point C. According to the Asymptote code, C = A + dir(90)*(F - A). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, vector F - A is (cos(theta_F) - cos(theta_A), sin(theta_F) - sin(theta_A)).\n\nThen dir(90) is (0,1). Multiplying a vector by dir(90)... Wait, in complex numbers, multiplying by e^(iπ/2) is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise. But how does that translate to vectors? If we have a vector (x, y), rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise gives (-y, x). So if dir(90) is a rotation operator, then multiplying vector (x, y) by dir(90) would give (-y, x). Therefore, dir(90)*(F - A) would be the vector F - A rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. Then adding that to point A gives point C.\n\nSo let me compute coordinates:\n\nLet me denote vector AF (from A to F) as (Δx, Δy) = (cos(theta_F) - cos(theta_A), sin(theta_F) - sin(theta_A)). Rotating this vector 90 degrees counterclockwise gives (-Δy, Δx). Therefore, point C is A + (-Δy, Δx).\n\nTherefore, coordinates of C:\n\nC_x = cos(theta_A) - [sin(theta_F) - sin(theta_A)]\n\nC_y = sin(theta_A) + [cos(theta_F) - cos(theta_A)]\n\nAlternatively, let me compute numerical values.\n\nFirst, compute theta_A ≈ 244.2857°, theta_F ≈ 295.714°.\n\nCompute cos(theta_A), sin(theta_A):\n\ncos(244.2857°): 244.2857° is in the third quadrant? Wait, 180° is straight left, 270° is straight down. 244.2857° is 244.2857 - 180 = 64.2857° into the third quadrant. Wait, no: 0° is to the right, 90° up, 180° left, 270° down. 244.2857° is between 180° and 270°, so third quadrant. Similarly, theta_F ≈ 295.714°, which is between 270° and 360°, fourth quadrant.\n\nLet me compute approximate values.\n\nFirst, compute theta_A = 244.2857°, theta_F = 295.714°.\n\nLet me convert these to radians for calculation? Maybe, but I can use approximate degree values.\n\nAlternatively, use exact expressions. Let me recall that in a regular heptagon, the angle between adjacent vertices from the center is 360/7 ≈ 51.4286°, as mentioned.\n\nLet me note that theta_A is for k=3: 90° + 3*(360/7)°, theta_F (which is V4) is 90° + 4*(360/7)°.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a symmetry or relationship we can exploit instead of calculating coordinates.\n\nBut maybe I need to calculate the coordinates.\n\nFirst, compute cos(theta_A) and sin(theta_A):\n\nLet me denote 360/7 ≈ 51.4286°, so:\n\ntheta_A = 90° + 3*(360/7)° = 90° + 3*(51.4286°) ≈ 90° + 154.2858° ≈ 244.2858°\n\nSimilarly, theta_F = 90° + 4*(360/7) ≈ 90° + 205.714° ≈ 295.714°\n\nCompute cos(244.2858°) and sin(244.2858°):\n\n244.2858° - 180° = 64.2858°, so reference angle is 64.2858° in third quadrant.\n\ncos(244.2858°) = -cos(64.2858°)\n\nsin(244.2858°) = -sin(64.2858°)\n\nSimilarly for theta_F = 295.714°, which is 295.714° - 270° = 25.714° in fourth quadrant.\n\ncos(295.714°) = cos(360° - 64.286°) = cos(64.286°)\n\nsin(295.714°) = -sin(64.286°)\n\nWait, 295.714° is 360° - 64.286°, yes. Therefore:\n\ncos(theta_F) = cos(64.286°)\n\nsin(theta_F) = -sin(64.286°)\n\nSimilarly, cos(theta_A) = -cos(64.286°)\n\nsin(theta_A) = -sin(64.286°)\n\nTherefore:\n\nVector AF is (cos(theta_F) - cos(theta_A), sin(theta_F) - sin(theta_A)) = [cos(64.286°) - (-cos(64.286°)), -sin(64.286°) - (-sin(64.286°))] = [2cos(64.286°), 0]. Wait, that can't be. Wait, let me recast:\n\nWait, theta_A is 244.2858°, theta_F is 295.714°. Let me compute:\n\ncos(theta_F) - cos(theta_A) = cos(295.714°) - cos(244.2858°) = cos(64.286°) - (-cos(64.286°)) = 2cos(64.286°)\n\nSimilarly, sin(theta_F) - sin(theta_A) = sin(295.714°) - sin(244.2858°) = -sin(64.286°) - (-sin(64.286°)) = 0. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So vector AF is (2cos(64.286°), 0). That suggests that vector AF is horizontal? Given that theta_A is 244.2858° and theta_F is 295.714°, so going from A to F is a vector that is horizontal? Because the y-component is zero. That seems possible given the symmetry.\n\nSo vector AF is (2cos(64.286°), 0). Therefore, rotating this vector 90 degrees counterclockwise would give (0, 2cos(64.286°)). Therefore, point C is A + (0, 2cos(64.286°)).\n\nBut coordinates of A are (cos(theta_A), sin(theta_A)) = (-cos(64.286°), -sin(64.286°)). Therefore, adding (0, 2cos(64.286°)) gives:\n\nC_x = -cos(64.286°)\n\nC_y = -sin(64.286°) + 2cos(64.286°)\n\nTherefore, coordinates of C are (-cos(64.286°), -sin(64.286°) + 2cos(64.286°)).\n\nNow, need to find angle BAC. Point B is V2, which is theta_2 ≈ 192.857°, which is 90° + 2*(360/7)° ≈ 90° + 102.857° ≈ 192.857°. Let me find coordinates of B similarly.\n\nFor theta_B = 192.857°, which is 180° + 12.857°, so reference angle 12.857° in third quadrant.\n\ncos(theta_B) = -cos(12.857°)\n\nsin(theta_B) = -sin(12.857°)\n\nBut 12.857° is 90° - 77.143°? Wait, 360/7 ≈ 51.428°, so 2*(360/7) ≈ 102.857°, so theta_B = 90° + 102.857° ≈ 192.857°, so reference angle is 192.857° - 180° = 12.857°, yes.\n\nAlternatively, note that theta_B = theta_A - 3*(360/7). Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nBut regardless, coordinates of B are (-cos(12.857°), -sin(12.857°)).\n\nWait, but how does this relate to other angles? Let me note that 64.286° is 360/7 * 1.5? Wait, 360/7 ≈ 51.428°, so 51.428° * 1.25 ≈ 64.286°. Specifically, 64.286° is 360/7 * (7/5)? Not sure. Alternatively, note that 64.286° is 90° - 25.714°, and 25.714° is 360/14 ≈ 25.714°. Maybe there is a relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the exact value of cos(64.286°). Since 64.286° is 360/7 * 1.5? Wait, 360/7 is approx 51.428, times 1.25 is approx 64.285. Alternatively, perhaps it's  (π - 2π/7)/2? Not sure. Maybe not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, note that 64.286° = 360/7 * 1.25? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate angles in the heptagon. Let me think. Since the central angles are 360/7, the internal angles are 128.57°, as we had before.\n\nBut maybe I need to find vectors AB and AC, then compute the angle between them.\n\nPoint A is (-cos(64.286°), -sin(64.286°)).\n\nPoint B is (-cos(12.857°), -sin(12.857°)).\n\nPoint C is (-cos(64.286°), -sin(64.286°) + 2cos(64.286°)).\n\nWait, let me note that 12.857° is  (theta_B - 180°) = 12.857°, and 64.286° is (theta_A - 180°). Also, note that 64.286° is 3*(360/7) - 90°? Maybe not. Alternatively, since theta_A is 90° + 3*(360/7), so theta_A - 90° = 3*(360/7). Therefore, 3*(360/7) ≈ 154.285°, which is the angle from the positive y-axis to point A. Not sure.\n\nBut let me try to compute vectors AB and AC.\n\nVector AB is B - A = [ -cos(12.857°) - (-cos(64.286°)), -sin(12.857°) - (-sin(64.286°)) ] = [ -cos(12.857°) + cos(64.286°), -sin(12.857°) + sin(64.286°) ]\n\nVector AC is C - A = [ -cos(64.286°) - (-cos(64.286°)), (-sin(64.286°) + 2cos(64.286°)) - (-sin(64.286°)) ] = [ 0, 2cos(64.286°) ]\n\nSo vector AC is (0, 2cos(64.286°)), which is straight up along the y-axis from point A? Wait, no, because point A has coordinates (-cos(64.286°), -sin(64.286°)), and adding (0, 2cos(64.286°)) gives C's y-coordinate as -sin(64.286°) + 2cos(64.286°). So vector AC is purely vertical? Because its x-component is 0. So from point A, moving straight up (if positive y is up) by 2cos(64.286°). \n\nTherefore, angle BAC is the angle between vector AB and vector AC. Since vector AC is straight up (along positive y-axis from point A), we can find the angle between AB and the vertical.\n\nTo compute angle BAC, we can use the dot product formula:\n\ncos(theta) = (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|)\n\nBut since AC is (0, 2cos(64.286°)), and AB is (Δx, Δy), then AB · AC = Δx*0 + Δy*(2cos(64.286°)) = Δy*(2cos(64.286°)).\n\nBut let me compute AB · AC and |AB| and |AC|.\n\nFirst, compute AB · AC:\n\nAB · AC = [ -cos(12.857°) + cos(64.286°) ] * 0 + [ -sin(12.857°) + sin(64.286°) ] * 2cos(64.286°) = [ -sin(12.857°) + sin(64.286°) ] * 2cos(64.286°)\n\nCompute |AB|:\n\n|AB| = sqrt[ ( -cos(12.857°) + cos(64.286°) )² + ( -sin(12.857°) + sin(64.286°) )² ]\n\nCompute |AC|:\n\n|AC| = sqrt(0² + [2cos(64.286°)]²) = 2cos(64.286°)\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos(theta) = [ (-sin(12.857°) + sin(64.286°)) * 2cos(64.286°) ] / [ sqrt(...)*2cos(64.286°) ) ] = [ -sin(12.857°) + sin(64.286°) ] / |AB|\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) = [ sin(64.286°) - sin(12.857°) ] / |AB|\n\nNow, need to compute sin(64.286°) - sin(12.857°) and |AB|.\n\nFirst, let me note that 64.286° ≈ 64.2857° and 12.857° ≈ 12.8571°, which are 360/7 * 1.25 and 360/7 * 0.25? Let me check:\n\nSince 360/7 ≈ 51.4286°, then:\n\n- 12.857° ≈ 360/7 / 4 ≈ 90/7 ≈ 12.857°. Yes, 360/28 = 90/7 ≈ 12.857°. Similarly, 64.2857° is 3*(360/7)/ (something)? Wait, 64.2857° is 360/7 * 1.25? 360/7 * 5/4 = 450/7 ≈ 64.2857°. Yes! Because 5/4 * 360/7 = 450/7 ≈ 64.2857°. Similarly, 12.857° is 360/28 = 90/7 ≈ 12.857°.\n\nTherefore, sin(64.2857°) = sin(450/7°) and sin(12.857°) = sin(90/7°). Let me write these angles in terms of π radians for possible trigonometric identities, but maybe it's easier to use sine subtraction formula.\n\nRecall that sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]\n\nSo sin(450/7°) - sin(90/7°) = 2 cos[ (450/7 + 90/7)/2 ] * sin[ (450/7 - 90/7)/2 ] = 2 cos(540/14°) * sin(360/14°) = 2 cos(360/7 * (540/14)/(360/7))... Wait:\n\nWait, 540/14° = 270/7 ≈ 38.571°, and 360/14° = 180/7 ≈ 25.714°.\n\nTherefore:\n\nsin(450/7°) - sin(90/7°) = 2 cos(270/7°) * sin(180/7°)\n\nNow, compute this value:\n\nLet me calculate 270/7 ≈ 38.571°, 180/7 ≈ 25.714°.\n\nAlso, note that 180/7° is the central angle between adjacent vertices of the heptagon divided by 2? Not sure. Anyway, let me compute cos(270/7°) and sin(180/7°). But maybe there's a relationship here.\n\nAlso, note that |AB| can be calculated using the distance between points A and B on the unit circle. Since both A and B are on the unit circle, the distance between them is 2*sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle between them.\n\nThe central angle between A (which is at angle theta_A = 90° + 3*(360/7)°) and B (which is at theta_B = 90° + 2*(360/7)°) is theta_A - theta_B = 360/7°, so θ = 360/7°. Therefore, |AB| = 2*sin( (360/7°)/2 ) = 2*sin(180/7°). \n\nYes! Because for two points on a unit circle separated by central angle θ, the chord length is 2r sin(θ/2). Since r=1, it's 2 sin(θ/2). Therefore, |AB| = 2 sin(180/7°).\n\nTherefore, going back to the previous expression:\n\ncos(theta) = [ sin(450/7°) - sin(90/7°) ] / |AB| = [ 2 cos(270/7°) sin(180/7°) ] / [ 2 sin(180/7°) ] = cos(270/7°)\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) = cos(270/7°). Therefore, theta = 270/7°, since theta is an acute angle (as angle BAC is likely acute given the diagram).\n\nTherefore, angle BAC is 270/7 degrees. Let me compute that:\n\n270 divided by 7 is approximately 38.57 degrees. But the problem asks for the exact value as a common fraction. 270/7 is already a fraction, but let me check if this is correct.\n\nWait, but 270/7° is the angle? Let me confirm:\n\nWe had cos(theta) = cos(270/7°), so theta = 270/7°, assuming it's in the correct quadrant. Since angle BAC is between vectors AB and AC. Given the positions, it should be acute, and 270/7 ≈ 38.57°, which is acute, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, angle BAC is 270/7 degrees. However, the problem says \"Express your answer as a common fraction.\" 270/7 is a common fraction, but maybe it can be simplified or expressed in terms of the heptagon angles? Wait, 270/7 is approximately 38.57°, which is 38 and 4/7 degrees. But the problem might expect an answer in degrees as a fraction, so 270/7. However, let me check my steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, we found that cos(theta) = cos(270/7°), leading to theta = 270/7°. Let me verify the steps:\n\nWe had:\n\ncos(theta) = [ sin(450/7°) - sin(90/7°) ] / |AB| \n\nThen we used the sine subtraction formula to write sin(450/7) - sin(90/7) = 2 cos(270/7) sin(180/7). Then |AB| is 2 sin(180/7). Therefore, dividing them gives cos(theta) = cos(270/7). Correct.\n\nTherefore, theta = 270/7 degrees. \n\nBut let me check if 270/7 is the correct measure. Let me compute 270 divided by 7:\n\n7*38 = 266, so 270-266=4, so 270/7 = 38 + 4/7 ≈ 38.57°, which seems reasonable.\n\nBut let me think again about the construction. Since angle BAC is formed by a vertex of the heptagon (B), a common vertex (A), and a vertex of the square (C). Given the symmetry, 270/7 degrees is approximately 38.57°, which seems plausible. But let me see if there's another way to get this angle.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the internal angle at A in the heptagon is 128.57°, and the square contributes a 90° angle at A? Wait, no. The square has a side AD, so at point A, the square would have a right angle between AD and AC. But in the heptagon, at point A, the internal angle is 128.57°, between sides AB and AD. Therefore, if we have the square attached along AD, then at point A, we have two angles: one from the heptagon (between AB and AD) of 128.57°, and one from the square (between AD and AC) of 90°. Therefore, the total angle around point A would be 128.57° + 90° + angle BAC? Wait, no, because angle BAC is between BA and CA. Let me draw a mental picture.\n\nAt point A, we have:\n\n- From the heptagon: side AB going to B, and side AD going to D.\n\n- From the square: side AC going to C, which is perpendicular to AD.\n\nTherefore, the angle between AB and AD is the internal angle of the heptagon, which is 128.57°, and the angle between AD and AC is 90° (since it's a square). Therefore, the angle between AB and AC is equal to the internal angle of the heptagon minus the angle of the square? Wait, if you imagine AB, then AD, then AC. The angle from AB to AD is 128.57°, and from AD to AC is 90°, but depending on the direction, maybe the total angle from AB to AC is 128.57° - 90° = 38.57°, which is exactly 270/7 ≈ 38.57°. Since 270/7 ≈ 38.57°, this matches. Therefore, this gives another way to see that angle BAC = internal angle at A (heptagon) - 90° = (5/7)*180° - 90° = (900/7 - 630/7) = 270/7°. \n\nYes! Because the internal angle of the heptagon is ((n-2)/n)*180° = (5/7)*180°, so 900/7° ≈ 128.57°. Then subtracting the 90° from the square gives 900/7 - 90 = 900/7 - 630/7 = 270/7°, which is approximately 38.57°, as before. Therefore, this confirms that angle BAC is 270/7 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the degree measure of angle BAC is 270/7 degrees, which as a common fraction is 270 over 7. The problem asks to express the answer as a common fraction, so boxed answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{270}{7}}.\n\nBut let me check once more for errors. If the internal angle at A is 128.57°, and the square contributes a 90° angle at A between AD and AC, then angle between BA and CA would be internal angle minus 90°, assuming that AC is on the other side of AD relative to BA. Given the Asymptote code's construction, where AC is obtained by rotating AD 90 degrees counterclockwise, we need to ensure the direction.\n\nIn the Asymptote code, vector AF (which is AD) is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise to get AC. Depending on the orientation of the heptagon, this might place AC either inside or outside the heptagon. However, since it's a square attached externally, likely AC is outside, so that the angle between BA and CA is indeed internal angle minus 90°, giving 270/7. \n\nAlternatively, if the rotation was clockwise, it might be internal angle plus 90°, but that would be larger than 180°, which is not possible for angle BAC. Hence, it's safe to assume it's 270/7°. \n\nTherefore, I think this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{270}{7}}\n</think>"}
