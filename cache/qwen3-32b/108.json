So, the question is about a nuclear reaction where element 118 was synthesized by bombarding Californium-249 with Calcium-48. Then, the nucleus of this element 118 first emits three identical particles x, followed by three alpha decays, ending up as element 112 with mass 282. We need to determine what particle x is.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basics about nuclear reactions and decay processes. When elements undergo nuclear reactions or decay, they emit certain particles, which affect their atomic number (Z) and mass number (A). \n\nAlpha decay involves the emission of an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus (²He⁴). So, when an element undergoes alpha decay, its atomic number decreases by 2 and its mass number decreases by 4. \n\nBeta decay, on the other hand, involves the emission of a beta particle (electron or positron), but the question here doesn't mention beta decay. The options given are neutron, proton, electron, or alpha particle for particle x. \n\nThe problem states that after emitting three particles x, the element undergoes three alpha decays to become element 112 with mass 282. Let me try to model this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the initial isotope of element 118. The synthesis was done by bombarding Cf-249 (Californium-249) with Ca-48 (Calcium-48). The reaction would be:\n\n²⁴⁹₉₈Cf + ⁴⁸₂₀Ca → ? \n\nAssuming this is a fusion reaction, the resulting nucleus would have an atomic number of 98 + 20 = 118, and a mass number of 249 + 48 = 297. So, the initial isotope of element 118 is ²⁹⁷₁₁₈Og (Oganesson). \n\nNow, this nucleus first emits three identical particles x. Let's denote the particle x as something. Then, after that, it undergoes three alpha decays to become element 112 with mass 282. \n\nLet me denote the steps:\n\nStart: ²⁹⁷₁₁₈Og\n\nAfter emitting 3x particles: Let's say each emission of x changes the nucleus. Let me call the resulting nucleus after three emissions as A.\n\nThen, three alpha decays take A to element 112 with mass 282.\n\nSo, working backwards might be easier. Let's start from the end.\n\nFinal nucleus: element 112, mass 282. Let's note that element 112 is Copernicium (Cn). \n\nBefore the three alpha decays, what was the nucleus?\n\nEach alpha decay reduces the atomic number by 2 and mass number by 4. So, going backwards, each step would increase Z by 2 and A by 4. \n\nSo, starting from the final nucleus (Z=112, A=282), going back three alpha decays:\n\nFirst reverse alpha decay (i.e., before the third alpha decay): Z = 112 + 2 = 114, A = 282 + 4 = 286.\n\nBefore the second alpha decay: Z = 114 + 2 = 116, A = 286 + 4 = 290.\n\nBefore the first alpha decay: Z = 116 + 2 = 118, A = 290 + 4 = 294.\n\nTherefore, the nucleus before the three alpha decays was ²⁹⁴₁₁₈Og. \n\nBut according to the problem, this nucleus (²⁹⁴₁₁₈Og) is the result after emitting three particles x from the original ²⁹⁷₁₁₈Og. \n\nSo, the original nucleus was ²⁹⁷₁₁₈Og, and after losing three particles x, it becomes ²⁹⁴₁₁₈Og. \n\nLet me calculate the difference between the original and the resulting nucleus after emitting three x particles. \n\nMass number difference: 297 - 294 = 3. \n\nAtomic number difference: 118 - 118 = 0. \n\nSo, over three emissions, the mass number decreased by 3, and the atomic number stayed the same. \n\nTherefore, each particle x must have a mass number of 1 (since 3 particles account for a total mass loss of 3), and a charge of 0 (since the atomic number didn't change). \n\nWhat particle has a mass number of 1 and no charge? That's a neutron. \n\nSo, particle x is a neutron. \n\nLet me check the options. Option A is Neutron. \n\nBut let me verify again. \n\nOriginal nucleus: ²⁹⁷₁₁₈. After three neutron emissions, it would lose 3 neutrons, so mass number decreases by 3 (297-3=294), and atomic number remains 118. Then, three alpha decays: each alpha decay reduces mass by 4 and atomic number by 2. Three alphas would reduce mass by 12 and atomic number by 6. \n\nSo starting from ²⁹⁴₁₁₈, after three alpha decays:\n\nMass number: 294 - 3×4 = 294 - 12 = 282.\n\nAtomic number: 118 - 3×2 = 118 - 6 = 112. \n\nWhich matches the given final product: element 112 with mass 282. \n\nTherefore, particle x is indeed a neutron. \n\nBut wait, why would the nucleus emit neutrons? Neutron emission is possible in certain nuclear reactions, especially when the nucleus is neutron-rich. Since the initial nucleus (²⁹⁷₁₁₈) is very heavy and perhaps neutron-rich, it might emit neutrons to reach a more stable configuration before undergoing alpha decay. \n\nSo the answer should be option A: Neutron. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are (A) Neutron, (B) Proton, (C) Electron, (D) Alpha Particle. \n\nIf x were alpha particles, then each alpha emission would reduce Z by 2 and A by 4. Three alphas would reduce Z by 6 and A by 12. But in our case, after emitting three x particles, Z remains same. So x can't be alpha. \n\nIf x were protons, then each emission would reduce Z by 1 and A by 1. Three protons would reduce Z by 3 and A by 3. But here Z doesn't change, so that's not possible. \n\nIf x were electrons (beta particles), but beta decay would increase Z by 1 (if beta minus) or decrease by 1 (beta plus). But since three emissions would change Z, but in our case Z is same. Also, beta decay doesn't change the mass number. Since the mass number decreased by 3, beta decay can't account for that. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is neutron. \n\nHence, the correct answer is A.\n</think>"}
