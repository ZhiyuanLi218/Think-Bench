Let me think about the physics involved here.\n\nFirst, since the car is starting from rest, the initial velocity, let's call it u, is 0 m/s. The final velocity, v, is given as 20.0 m/s. The time taken, t, is 15.0 seconds. The question is asking for the distance traveled, which is displacement, right?\n\nHmm, uniform acceleration means the acceleration is constant. So I can use one of the kinematic equations. Let me recall the equations of motion. There are a few standard ones. One that might be useful here is the equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, time, and displacement. I think it's something like:\n\ns = (u + v)/2 * t\n\nWait, yes, that's the formula for average velocity multiplied by time. Since the acceleration is constant, the average velocity is just the average of the initial and final velocities. That makes sense. Let me check if I remember that correctly. So if you start at u and end at v, then average velocity is (u + v)/2. Then multiply by time to get displacement. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another equation is s = ut + 0.5*a*t². But since I don't know the acceleration yet, maybe I need to calculate it first. Let me see. Maybe both methods will work. Let me try both ways to verify.\n\nFirst method: average velocity. So u = 0, v = 20 m/s, t = 15 s. Then average velocity is (0 + 20)/2 = 10 m/s. Then displacement s = average velocity * time = 10 * 15 = 150 meters. Wait, but 150 meters is option A. But wait, maybe I did something wrong here?\n\nWait, let me check the second method. Let's find acceleration first. Acceleration a = (v - u)/t = (20 - 0)/15 = 20/15 = 1.333... m/s². Then use s = ut + 0.5*a*t². Since u = 0, the equation simplifies to s = 0.5 * a * t². Plugging in the numbers: 0.5 * (1.333...) * (15)^2.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 15 squared is 225. Then 0.5 * 1.333... is 0.666..., and 0.666... * 225. Let me compute 225 divided by 1.5 since 0.666... is 2/3. 225 divided by 1.5 is 150. So again, 150 meters. So that's the same answer as the first method. So both methods give 150 meters, which is option A. But wait, the options given are A:150 m, B:300 m, C:450 m, D:600 m. So according to this, the answer is A. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations?\n\nWait, let me think again. Another formula is v² = u² + 2as. Let me try that. Solving for s: s = (v² - u²)/(2a). We know u is 0, so s = v²/(2a). We already found a is 20/15 = 4/3 m/s². Then s = (20)^2 / (2*(4/3)) = 400 / (8/3) = 400 * 3/8 = 150 m. Again, same answer. So all three equations give me 150 meters. So that must be the correct answer. Therefore, the answer should be A:150 m.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the formula. Let me check the first method again. The average velocity is (initial + final)/2 only when acceleration is constant. Yes, that's correct. So if you have uniform acceleration, then average velocity is indeed the average of the initial and final velocities. So that's valid here. So all three methods confirm 150 meters. So why is there an option A? The options given include A:150 m. So then the answer is A. But I want to make sure that the question is asking for displacement and not distance. But since the car is moving in one direction, accelerating uniformly, distance and displacement should be the same. So no issue there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion between average speed and something else? But no, the calculation seems straightforward. Let me just check the numbers once more. 20 m/s final speed in 15 seconds. Acceleration is 20/15 = 1.333 m/s². Then displacement is 0.5 * 1.333 * 225. 0.5 * 225 is 112.5, times 1.333... Let me compute 112.5 * 1.333. Well, 112.5 * 1.333 is approximately 112.5 * 4/3 = 150. Exactly. Yes, because 1.333 is 4/3. So 112.5 * 4/3 = (112.5 / 3) * 4 = 37.5 * 4 = 150. Yep, same result.\n\nSo all the methods are consistent. So the answer must be A:150 m. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when people think about acceleration, they might mistakenly use the final velocity multiplied by time, which would be 20*15=300, which is option B. But that's wrong because that would be the case if the car was moving at constant speed. But here it's starting from rest, so the average speed is half of the final speed. So 10 m/s average speed, 15 seconds, 150 m. So the answer is A.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me check a textbook example. For example, if a car accelerates from 0 to v in time t with constant acceleration, then displacement is (1/2)*a*t², and since a = v/t, then displacement is (1/2)*(v/t)*t² = (1/2)*v*t. Which is the same as average velocity (v/2) times t. So yes, displacement is (v/2)*t = (20/2)*15 = 10*15=150 m. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A:150 m. The other options are incorrect. For example, option B is double that, which would be if someone forgot to divide by 2. Option C is triple, and D is four times. So yeah, A is correct. I think I've verified it multiple ways. So I'm confident the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
