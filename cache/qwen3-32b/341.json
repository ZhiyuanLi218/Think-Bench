According to the kinetic molecular theory, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is proportional to temperature; the higher the temperature, the more intense the molecular movement, and the faster the diffusion. Therefore, option A is incorrect.","Step 2: Analyze option B: Brownian motion is the irregular motion of liquid molecules. Brownian motion is the phenomenon of suspended particles in a liquid or gas undergoing irregular motion caused by fluid molecules constantly colliding with suspended particles, not by the motion of the liquid molecules themselves. Therefore, option B is incorrect.","Step 3: Analyze Option C: There are both gravitational and repulsive forces between molecules. According to molecular kinetic theory, there are indeed both gravitational and repulsive forces between molecules. When the distance between molecules is relatively large, it mainly manifests as gravitational force, and when the distance between molecules is very small, it mainly manifests as repulsive force. Therefore, Option C is correct.","step4: Analyze option D: The intermolecular force always increases with the increase of the distance between molecules. In fact, the intermolecular force decreases rather than increases as the distance increases. Therefore, option D is incorrect.","Step 5: Comprehensive analysis of the four options, only option C 'gravitational and repulsive forces exist simultaneously between molecules' is correct."]}},"question_type":"Easy","category":"physics","subcategory":"thermodynamics","prediction":"To determine the correct statement regarding the **kinetic theory of molecules**, let's carefully analyze each option based on fundamental principles of molecular motion and intermolecular forces.\n\n---\n\n### Option A:  \n**\"The speed of gas diffusion is independent of temperature.\"**\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**. According to the **kinetic theory**, the **average kinetic energy** of gas molecules is **directly proportional to temperature**. As temperature increases, molecules move faster, and thus the **rate of diffusion** increases. Therefore, the speed of diffusion **depends on temperature**.\n\n---\n\n### Option B:  \n**\"Brownian motion is the irregular movement of liquid molecules.\"**\n\nThis statement is also **incorrect**. **Brownian motion** refers to the **random, zig-zag motion of tiny particles** suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas). It is **caused by the collisions of the fluid's molecules** with the suspended particles. So, it is not the motion of the liquid molecules themselves, but the motion of the **suspended particles** due to the fluid's molecules.\n\n---\n\n### Option C:  \n**\"There exists both attractive and repulsive forces between molecules simultaneously.\"**\n\nThis statement is **correct**. The **kinetic theory of matter** does account for **intermolecular forces**. When molecules are close to each other, **repulsive forces** dominate; when they are slightly farther apart, **attractive forces** take over. So, **both forces exist simultaneously**, depending on the distance between the molecules. This dual nature of intermolecular forces is essential in explaining phenomena like phase changes and surface tension.\n\n---\n\n### Option D:  \n**\"The attractive force between molecules always increases as the distance between molecules increases.\"**\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**. According to **intermolecular force models**, such as the **Lennard-Jones potential**, **attractive forces** decrease with increasing distance between molecules. At a certain point, the attractive force becomes **negligible**. Thus, the statement contradicts basic physical principles.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which statement about the kinetic theory of molecules is correct. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"The speed of gas diffusion is independent of temperature.\" Hmm, I remember from what I've studied that temperature affects the kinetic energy of gas molecules. Higher temperature means higher kinetic energy, which should make the molecules move faster. If they move faster, they should diffuse more quickly. So if the speed of diffusion is independent of temperature, that doesn't make sense. I think A is incorrect.\n\nNext, option B: \"Brownian motion is the irregular movement of liquid molecules.\" Wait, Brownian motion is the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas), right? It's caused by collisions with the molecules of the fluid. So it's the movement of the suspended particles, not the liquid molecules themselves. So B is also incorrect because it's the particles that are moving irregularly, not the liquid molecules. The liquid molecules are the ones causing the Brownian motion by hitting the particles.\n\nOption C: \"There exists both attractive and repulsive forces between molecules simultaneously.\" This sounds familiar. In the kinetic theory, especially when considering intermolecular forces, I think that at certain distances, both forces are present. For example, when molecules are close together, repulsive forces dominate, but at a bit farther distance, attractive forces are present. So maybe both exist at the same time, depending on the distance. So C might be correct. But I need to be careful here. The question is about the correct statement according to the kinetic theory. I think the theory does acknowledge both forces, so C could be right.\n\nOption D: \"The attractive force between molecules always increases as the distance between molecules increases.\" Wait, if the distance increases, the attractive force should decrease, right? Like, gravitational force or electrostatic force decreases with distance. So if molecules are farther apart, the attractive force between them should decrease, not increase. So D is incorrect. \n\nSo going back, the correct answer should be C. Let me double-check. \n\nOption A is wrong because temperature does affect diffusion speed. B is wrong because Brownian motion is about suspended particles, not the liquid molecules. C is correct because both attractive and repulsive forces exist between molecules. D is wrong because attractive force decreases with distance. So the answer is C.\n</think>"}
