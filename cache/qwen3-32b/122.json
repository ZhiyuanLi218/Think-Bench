Suddenly, a **constant force** is applied to it. The problem specifies that the **force originally acting on the particle does not change**. This implies that the original force(s) that were keeping the particle in equilibrium (i.e., zero net force) remain the same, but now an **additional constant force** is introduced.\n\nAs a result, the **net force** acting on the particle is now equal to the **new constant force**, and this leads to a **constant acceleration**.\n\n---\n\n### Analyzing the Options\n\nLet’s evaluate each option based on the physics principles of motion and forces:\n\n#### **(A) The direction of the particle's velocity is always the same as the direction of the constant force.**\n\nThis is **not necessarily true**. If the constant force is applied **at an angle** to the velocity vector, the direction of the velocity will change over time due to the acceleration caused by the force. The velocity vector only remains aligned with the force if the force is always in the same direction as the velocity, which is not guaranteed here.\n\n✅ **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n#### **(B) The direction of the particle's velocity cannot always be perpendicular to the direction of the constant force.**\n\nThis is a **correct** statement. If the force is initially perpendicular to the velocity (as in a case similar to uniform circular motion), the force will cause the velocity to change direction over time. As the velocity vector changes, it will no longer remain perpendicular to the constant force vector. Thus, it is **impossible** for the velocity to **always** remain perpendicular to the force.\n\n✅ **Correct**\n\n---\n\n#### **(C) The direction of the particle's acceleration is always the same as the direction of the constant force.**\n\nThis is a **correct** statement. According to Newton’s Second Law, the acceleration of a particle is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and in the same direction. Since the force is **constant**, the acceleration is also **constant** and in the **same direction** as the force.\n\n✅ **Correct**\n\n---\n\n#### **(D) The rate of change of the particle's speed per unit time is always constant.**\n\nThis is **not necessarily true**. The rate of change of **speed** (a scalar) is **not** the same as the magnitude of the acceleration vector. The rate of change of speed is the **component of acceleration in the direction of the velocity vector**. If the velocity vector changes direction (due to the force not being in the direction of motion), this component will vary over time, even though the acceleration vector is constant. Thus, the rate of change of speed is **not constant** in general.\n\n✅ **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe two statements that are **always true** in the given scenario are:\n\n- **(B)** The direction of the particle's velocity cannot always be perpendicular to the direction of the constant force.\n- **(C)** The direction of the particle's acceleration is always the same as the direction of the constant force.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Answer: B and C**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So the question is about a particle that's in uniform linear motion, which means it's moving at a constant velocity in a straight line. Then a constant force is applied to it, and the original force acting on the particle doesn't change. Wait, the original force is still acting? Or is there another force added? The wording says \"a constant force is applied to it, and the force originally acting on the particle does not change.\" Hmm. Maybe the particle was initially under some force that kept it in uniform motion? Wait, no—if it's in uniform linear motion, that would mean the net force on it is zero. Because according to Newton's first law, if there's no net force, it continues in uniform motion. But the problem says a constant force is applied now, and the original force doesn't change. So maybe there was a force acting on it before, but the net force was zero? Wait, but if it's moving at constant velocity, the net force must be zero. So if another constant force is applied, then the net force would change. Let me parse the question again carefully.\n\n\"A particle is doing uniform linear motion, now a constant force is applied to it, and the force originally acting on the particle does not change, then...\" So the original force (the one that was acting before) doesn't change. But the particle was moving uniformly, so the original force must have been balanced by another force? Or maybe the original force was zero? Wait, if the particle is in uniform linear motion, that means the net force on it is zero. So if there was a force acting on it originally, there must have been another force canceling it. Now, a new constant force is applied. The original force doesn't change. So the net force is now the original force (which was part of the previous balance) plus the new force. So the net force is the new force, since the original forces are still balanced? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose the particle was moving with uniform velocity. So net force is zero. Then, a constant force is applied. The original force (or forces) acting on the particle does not change. Therefore, the new net force is the new applied force, because the original forces were already balanced. So the net force is equal to the new constant force. Therefore, the particle will accelerate according to F = ma.\n\nNow, the options are about the direction of velocity, acceleration, and the rate of change of speed.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n(A) The direction of the particle's velocity is always the same as the direction of the constant force.\n\nIs this true? If the particle is moving in a straight line and a constant force is applied in some direction, then the velocity direction might change if the force is not in the same direction as velocity. For example, if the force is perpendicular, the velocity direction will change (like in circular motion). But if the force is in the same direction as velocity, then velocity direction remains same, but speed changes. But the question says \"the direction of the particle's velocity is always the same as the direction of the constant force.\" But if the force is in a different direction, the velocity direction can change. So option A is not necessarily correct.\n\n(B) The direction of the particle's velocity cannot always be perpendicular to the direction of the constant force.\n\nHmm. So this is saying that it's impossible for the velocity to always be perpendicular to the force. Let's think. If a force is applied perpendicular to the velocity, then the velocity direction changes. For example, in circular motion with centripetal force. However, in that case, the force direction is continuously changing to stay perpendicular. But in this problem, the force is constant. If the force is constant and perpendicular to the initial velocity, then the acceleration is constant and perpendicular. Wait, but if the velocity direction is changing, the force direction (which is fixed) won't stay perpendicular to the velocity. For example, if you have a particle moving along the x-axis with velocity v, and a constant force in the y-direction. Initially, velocity is along x, force along y. The acceleration is along y. The velocity in x remains v_x (since there's no force in x), and velocity in y increases as a*t. So the velocity vector is at an angle whose tangent is (a*t)/v_x. So as time increases, the velocity direction is changing, but the force is still in the y-direction. So the angle between velocity and force is decreasing over time. Initially, it's 90 degrees, but as time goes on, the velocity vector is more aligned with the force direction. Therefore, the velocity can't remain perpendicular to the force direction. So option B is correct. Because if the force is constant and the particle is accelerating, the velocity can't always be perpendicular. Therefore, B is a correct statement.\n\n(C) The direction of the particle's acceleration is always the same as the direction of the constant force.\n\nYes. Because acceleration is given by a = F/m. Since the force is constant, the acceleration is constant and in the same direction as the force. So this is correct. So option C is correct.\n\n(D) The rate of change of the particle's speed per unit time is always constant.\n\nWait. The rate of change of speed is the derivative of speed with respect to time. If the acceleration is constant in direction and magnitude, does that mean the rate of change of speed is constant? Let's think. If the acceleration is in the same direction as velocity, then speed increases at a constant rate (since acceleration is constant). However, if the acceleration is at an angle to the velocity, then the rate of change of speed is the component of acceleration in the direction of velocity. Since the velocity direction is changing, the component of acceleration in the direction of velocity changes over time. Therefore, the rate of change of speed is not necessarily constant. For example, if you have a constant acceleration vector at an angle to the velocity, the speed's derivative would vary. Therefore, option D is not correct. So D is false.\n\nSo the correct options are B and C. Wait, but the problem says \"choose\" from A to D. Wait, the options are (A) to (D), and the answer is to select which ones are correct. But the problem may be a multiple-choice question where only one option is correct. Wait, the original problem is in Chinese? The user just provided the translation. Let me check again.\n\nThe original question is in Chinese, but the user provided the translation. The options are A to D, and the user says \"Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So maybe it's a multiple-choice question where multiple options can be correct? Or is it a single answer?\n\nIn Chinese physics exams, sometimes multiple choices are allowed, but sometimes it's single answer. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe question says \"a constant force is applied to it, and the force originally acting on the particle does not change\". Wait, the original force. Wait, if the particle was in uniform linear motion, the net force was zero. If there was a force acting on it originally, there must have been another force to balance it. Now, a new force is applied, and the original force does not change. Therefore, the new net force is the original force plus the new force plus any other original balancing forces? Wait, maybe the original force is the net force. Wait, maybe the wording is that before applying the new force, the particle was under some force(s) that resulted in zero net force. Now, a new constant force is applied, and the original forces (which were keeping it in equilibrium) do not change. Therefore, the net force is equal to the new applied force. Therefore, acceleration is F/m, direction same as the new force. So acceleration is constant in direction and magnitude.\n\nSo for option C: The direction of the particle's acceleration is always the same as the direction of the constant force. Since acceleration is F/m, yes. So C is correct.\n\nOption B: The direction of the particle's velocity cannot always be perpendicular to the direction of the constant force. As discussed earlier, if the force is perpendicular to initial velocity, velocity direction will change such that it can't stay perpendicular. So B is correct.\n\nSo if the question allows multiple correct answers, then B and C are correct. However, looking at the options, the user might be expecting to select all correct ones. But in some cases, maybe only one is correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the force originally acting on the particle does not change\". If the original force was zero, but that can't be because the particle was in uniform motion. If the original net force was zero. Suppose the particle was under multiple forces which balanced out. Now, a new force is added. The original forces (which were part of the balance) do not change. Therefore, the new net force is the new force. So acceleration is in the direction of the new force. So C is correct.\n\nSo for option B: The direction of velocity cannot always be perpendicular. As discussed, if the force is perpendicular to initial velocity, the velocity direction will change, so it can't remain perpendicular. Therefore, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, both B and C are correct. However, looking at the options, maybe the question is from a test where only one option is correct. Wait, let me check the options again. The options are (A) to (D). The original question is in Chinese, but the translation seems accurate. Let me check if there's any possibility that only one is correct.\n\nIf the question is from a standard test like the Chinese Gaokao, sometimes they have multiple correct answers but you have to choose all that apply. However, the way the user presented the options suggests that it's a single-answer question, but perhaps not. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: The direction of velocity is always same as force. No, only if force is in same direction as velocity. If not, velocity direction changes. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B: Velocity cannot always be perpendicular to force. As discussed, if initially perpendicular, velocity direction changes so that it's not perpendicular anymore. Therefore, it's impossible for velocity to always be perpendicular. Hence, B is correct.\n\nOption C: Acceleration direction same as force. Yes, because a=F/m. Correct.\n\nOption D: Rate of change of speed per unit time is constant. That is, dv/dt is constant? Wait, dv/dt is the acceleration. But acceleration is a vector. However, the rate of change of speed (which is the magnitude of velocity) is not the same as acceleration. For example, if acceleration is perpendicular to velocity, the speed doesn't change. But if acceleration has a component along velocity, then the speed changes. So the rate of change of speed is the dot product of acceleration and velocity divided by speed. Since acceleration is constant, but velocity is changing, this rate is not necessarily constant. For example, if acceleration is at an angle to velocity, then as velocity changes direction, the component of acceleration along velocity changes. Therefore, dv/dt (the rate of change of speed) is not constant. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, correct options are B and C. But looking back at the original question, if it's a multiple-choice question where multiple options can be selected, then B and C. However, in some cases, the options might be structured such that only one is correct. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user hasn't specified whether multiple answers are allowed. However, looking at the options, B and C are both correct. Let me check if there's any possibility that B is incorrect.\n\nOption B says \"The direction of the particle's velocity cannot always be perpendicular to the direction of the constant force.\" So this is saying that it's impossible for the velocity direction to always be perpendicular. In other words, there's no scenario where velocity remains perpendicular to the force direction for all time. Which is correct because with a constant force, if initially velocity is perpendicular, the acceleration is in the direction of the force, so velocity gains a component in that direction, making the velocity direction change so it's no longer perpendicular. Therefore, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and C. However, looking at the options given, if the original question is from a source where only one option is correct, maybe there's a trick. But according to standard physics, both B and C are correct. However, let me check again the options. The options are labeled A to D, and the user says \"we should choose\". In Chinese exams, sometimes multiple options can be correct, but the way it's presented here might imply that only one is correct. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the question says \"a constant force is applied to it, and the force originally acting on the particle does not change\". Wait, maybe there was an original force acting on the particle, and now another force is added. So the total force is the original plus the new one. But the original force does not change. So the net force is original force plus new force. But initially, the particle was in uniform motion, so original net force was zero. Therefore, original force must have been balanced by another force. But the problem states that the original force does not change. So if there was, for example, gravity and a normal force balancing it, and now you add a new force, then the net force is the new force. Therefore, acceleration is due to the new force. So in that case, the acceleration direction is same as the new force, hence option C is correct. So C is correct.\n\nTherefore, if the options are multiple-select, B and C are correct. But if it's a single-answer question, maybe there's a mistake. However, in standard physics, both B and C are correct. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\n(A) Velocity direction always same as force. No.\n\n(B) Velocity cannot always be perpendicular to force. Yes.\n\n(C) Acceleration direction same as force. Yes.\n\n(D) Rate of change of speed is constant. No.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and C. However, looking at the original problem's options, maybe in the source it's a multiple-select question. But since the user hasn't specified, and given that in many standardized tests, sometimes only one option is correct, but in this case, both B and C are correct. However, let me check if there's any possibility that B is not correct. For example, if the force is zero? No, because the question says a constant force is applied. So the force is non-zero. Therefore, B is correct. Therefore, the correct options are B and C. But the user might expect only one answer. Wait, looking back, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let's re-express option B. It says \"The direction of the particle's velocity cannot always be perpendicular to the direction of the constant force.\" So this is a negative statement. It means that it's impossible for the velocity to always be perpendicular. Which is true because, as discussed, with a constant force, the velocity direction can't stay perpendicular. So B is correct. Therefore, both B and C are correct. If the options are multiple-choice and the user is to select all that apply, then B and C. But if the original question is from a source where only one is correct, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, based on physics principles, both B and C are correct. Therefore, the answer should be B and C. But looking at the options given, if the user is to select from A to D, and the options are single-select, maybe there's a mistake. But I think in the original context, it's likely that multiple options are correct. However, since the user hasn't specified, and given the way the question is presented, I need to check if the original problem might have a different intention.\n\nWait, let me check option C again. The direction of the particle's acceleration is always the same as the direction of the constant force. Since acceleration is F/m, yes. So this is correct. So C is definitely correct. Therefore, if the options are multiple-choice, then B and C are correct. However, if the original question is from a source where only one option is correct, maybe there's a trick. But according to physics, both B and C are correct. Therefore, I think the correct answers are B and C. However, looking at the options again, maybe there's a translation issue. The original Chinese might have nuances. For example, the original force \"does not change\"—maybe it means that the net force doesn't change? But no, the translation says \"the force originally acting on the particle does not change\". So if there were multiple original forces, they remain the same, and a new force is added. Hence, the net force is original forces (which were balanced) plus the new force, so net force is the new force. Therefore, acceleration is in the direction of the new force. So C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and C. But since the user hasn't specified if multiple answers are allowed, but in the way the question is presented (options A-D), it's possible that in the original context, it's a multiple-select question. However, in many cases, such questions might have only one correct answer. Let me check if there's any possibility that only one is correct. For example, maybe option B is not necessarily correct. Suppose the force is zero? No, because a force is applied. Or maybe if the particle's velocity is zero? No, it's in uniform motion, so velocity is constant but not necessarily zero. Therefore, B is correct. So I think the correct answers are B and C.\n\nBut since the user is asking for the answer in the format \"Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\", and given that in some contexts, multiple letters can be listed, like BC or something. However, the user might expect the correct options to be selected. Given that, I think the correct answers are B and C. However, in some textbooks or exams, maybe only C is considered correct. Let me think again.\n\nOption B says \"The direction of the particle's velocity cannot always be perpendicular to the direction of the constant force.\" This is a bit tricky. The wording is \"cannot always be perpendicular\". So it's saying that it's impossible for the velocity direction to always be perpendicular to the force. Which is correct, as discussed. Therefore, B is correct. Therefore, both B and C are correct. Hence, if the options allow multiple answers, then B and C. Otherwise, if forced to choose one, but both are correct, there might be an issue. But according to physics, both are correct.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answers are B and C. So the answer should be B and C. However, the way the user presented the options might require a specific format. If it's a multiple-choice question where multiple options are correct, then the answer is B and C. But if the options are single-select, there might be a problem. Given the information provided, I'll go with B and C.\n</think>"}
