I need to calculate the energy released from this deuterium fusion reaction. The reaction given is two deuterium nuclei (each is H-2) fusing to form helium-3 and a neutron. The masses are provided, and I have to use the mass difference to find the energy via E=mc², right?\n\nFirst, let me write down the reaction again to make sure I have it right:\n\n²H + ²H → ³He + ¹n\n\nSo, two deuterium atoms combine to form helium-3 and a neutron. The mass of each deuterium is 2.0136 u, helium-3 is 3.0150 u, and the neutron is 1.0087 u. \n\nThe energy released comes from the mass defect, the difference between the initial mass and the final mass. The formula is:\n\nEnergy released = (Total initial mass - Total final mass) × c²\n\nBut since the masses are given in atomic mass units (u), and there's a conversion factor of 931 MeV/c² per u, I can calculate the mass defect in u first, then multiply by 931 MeV/u to get the energy in MeV.\n\nLet me calculate the total initial mass. There are two deuterium nuclei, so:\n\nTotal initial mass = 2 × 2.0136 u = 4.0272 u\n\nTotal final mass is the mass of helium-3 plus the mass of the neutron:\n\nTotal final mass = 3.0150 u + 1.0087 u = 4.0237 u\n\nNow, subtract the final mass from the initial mass to get the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = 4.0272 u - 4.0237 u = 0.0035 u\n\nThen multiply by 931 MeV/u to get the energy:\n\nEnergy = 0.0035 u × 931 MeV/u = Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 0.0035 × 931. Let me compute 0.0035 × 900 = 3.15 and 0.0035 × 31 = 0.1085. So total is approx 3.15 + 0.1085 = 3.2585 MeV. Hmm, so approximately 3.26 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 3.3 MeV. So that should be the answer. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal initial mass: 2 × 2.0136 = 4.0272 u. Correct.\n\nTotal final mass: 3.0150 + 1.0087. Let me add them again. 3.0150 + 1.0087. 3 + 1 is 4, 0.015 + 0.0087 is 0.0237, so total 4.0237 u. Correct.\n\nMass defect: 4.0272 - 4.0237 = 0.0035 u. Correct.\n\nMultiply by 931: 0.0035 × 931. Let me compute this more accurately. 931 × 0.0035. Well, 931 × 0.003 = 2.793, and 931 × 0.0005 = 0.4655. Adding them gives 2.793 + 0.4655 = 3.2585 MeV. So approximately 3.26 MeV. The closest option is B, 3.3 MeV. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Let me check if I considered all the masses correctly. The reaction is two deuteriums going to one helium-3 and one neutron. Yes, so two on the left, one and one on the right. The masses are given correctly. I think the calculation is right. So option B is correct.\n</think>"}
