Alright, let me start by recalling that the modulus of a complex number is its distance from the origin in the complex plane. For any complex number a + bi, the modulus is sqrt(a² + b²). \n\nFirst, maybe I should compute the numerator and denominator separately. Let me write down z first. Given z = 1 + i. Let me compute 3z + 1 and 5z + 7. \n\nStarting with the numerator: 3z + 1. Since z is 1 + i, multiplying by 3 gives 3*1 + 3*i = 3 + 3i. Then adding 1 would be adding 1 to the real part, right? So 3 + 1 + 3i = 4 + 3i. So the numerator is 4 + 3i. \n\nNow the denominator: 5z + 7. Again, z is 1 + i. Multiply by 5: 5*1 + 5*i = 5 + 5i. Then add 7 to that. Adding 7 to the real part: 5 + 7 + 5i = 12 + 5i. So the denominator is 12 + 5i. \n\nSo now, w is (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To find |w|, I can use the property that |a/b| = |a| / |b|. That might be easier than simplifying the complex fraction first. Let me confirm that property. Yes, modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli. So I can compute |numerator| divided by |denominator|.\n\nLet me calculate |numerator| first. The numerator is 4 + 3i. Its modulus is sqrt(4² + 3²) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5. Okay, that's straightforward. \n\nNow the denominator is 12 + 5i. Its modulus is sqrt(12² + 5²) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13. \n\nTherefore, |w| is 5 / 13. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I did everything correctly. \n\nFirst, verifying the numerator: 3z + 1. z is 1 + i. 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Then adding 1: 3 + 1 + 3i = 4 + 3i. Correct. \n\nDenominator: 5z + 7. 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7: 5 + 7 + 5i = 12 + 5i. Correct. \n\nModulus of numerator: sqrt(4² + 3²) = 5. Correct. \n\nModulus of denominator: sqrt(12² + 5²) = 13. Correct. \n\nTherefore, |w| = 5/13. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check by actually computing w and then taking its modulus? Let me try that method to confirm. \n\nTo compute w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i. \n\nSo:\n\nw = [(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)] / [(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)]\n\nFirst compute the denominator: (12)^2 - (5i)^2 = 144 - 25i². Since i² = -1, this becomes 144 - 25(-1) = 144 + 25 = 169. Which matches the modulus squared, since |denominator| was 13, so squared is 169. \n\nNow compute the numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). Let me use FOIL:\n\nFirst: 4*12 = 48\n\nOuter: 4*(-5i) = -20i\n\nInner: 3i*12 = 36i\n\nLast: 3i*(-5i) = -15i²\n\nCombine all terms: 48 - 20i + 36i -15i². Combine like terms:\n\nReal parts: 48 - 15i². Since i² = -1, this is 48 -15(-1) = 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nImaginary parts: (-20i + 36i) = 16i.\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to 63 + 16i. Therefore, w is (63 + 16i)/169. Which can be written as 63/169 + (16/169)i. \n\nNow compute |w|. That would be sqrt( (63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2 ) = sqrt( (63² + 16²)/169² ) = sqrt( (3969 + 256)/169² ) = sqrt( 4225 / 169² ). \n\nCompute sqrt(4225)/sqrt(169²). sqrt(4225) is 65, since 65² = 4225. sqrt(169²) is 169. Therefore, |w| is 65/169. Simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 13. 65 ÷13=5, 169 ÷13=13. So 5/13. \n\nSame result as before. So that confirms it. Therefore, |w| is indeed 5/13. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that modulus of a quotient is quotient of moduli. So since |numerator| is 5 and |denominator| is 13, then |w| is 5/13. \n\nSo either way, the answer is 5/13. \n\nWait, but let me check once more if I didn't make a mistake in calculating the numerator and denominator. Let me recalculate the numerator (3z + 1) and denominator (5z + 7). \n\nz = 1 + i. \n\n3z = 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Adding 1: 3 + 1 + 3i = 4 + 3i. Correct. \n\n5z = 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7: 5 + 7 + 5i = 12 + 5i. Correct. \n\nSo that's right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a smarter way to do this without computing numerator and denominator? For example, using properties of complex numbers. \n\nBut since z is given, and the expression is linear in z, probably not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe compute w directly by substituting z = 1 + i into (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). But that's essentially what I did. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to use polar form? Let me see. \n\nBut converting z to polar form would require computing modulus and argument. z = 1 + i, modulus is sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2), argument is π/4. \n\nBut then 3z + 1 and 5z + 7 would be more complex expressions. Probably not easier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the modulus squared? Since |w|² = (w * conjugate(w)). But again, that would involve similar steps as before. \n\nBut given that I already verified through two different methods (direct computation of |num| / |den| and simplifying w then computing |w|) and both gave me 5/13, I think that's solid. \n\nBut let me check the multiplication in the numerator again when I multiplied out (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). \n\nFirst term: 4*12 = 48. \n\nOuter term: 4*(-5i) = -20i. \n\nInner term: 3i*12 = 36i. \n\nLast term: 3i*(-5i) = -15i². \n\nAdding them up: 48 -20i +36i -15i². Combine like terms:\n\nReal parts: 48 -15i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 48 -15*(-1) = 48 +15 = 63. \n\nImaginary parts: (-20i + 36i) = 16i. \n\nYes, so numerator is 63 + 16i. Then modulus squared is 63² + 16². Let me compute that again. \n\n63 squared: 60² + 2*60*3 + 3² = 3600 + 360 + 9 = 3969. \n\n16 squared is 256. \n\nSo 3969 + 256 = 4225. Which is 65². Therefore sqrt(4225) is 65. Then divided by 169, which is 13², so 65/169 reduces to 5/13. Correct. \n\nSo everything checks out. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5/13. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe modulus of $ w $ is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}.\n</think>"}
