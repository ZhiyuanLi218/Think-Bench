So, we have a solution of H3PO4 (phosphoric acid) with pH=2 at room temperature. The question is about which of the four statements (A to D) are correct. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"The number of H+ in one liter of solution is 0.02 NA.\" \n\nHmm, pH is 2, which means the concentration of H+ ions is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-2) M. So in one liter, the moles of H+ would be 0.01 mol, right? Because concentration is moles per liter. So the number of H+ ions would be 0.01 * NA. But option A says 0.02 NA. That seems off. Wait, maybe I need to consider that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid and can donate more than one H+? But pH is a measure of the total H+ concentration in solution. So even though H3PO4 can donate multiple protons, the pH=2 already accounts for all the H+ ions present. So the concentration of H+ is 0.01 M, not 0.02. Therefore, option A is incorrect. \n\nMoving on to option B: \"c(H+)=c(H2PO4^-) + 2c(HPO4^2-) + 3c(PO4^3-) + c(OH-).\"\n\nThis looks like a charge balance equation. Let me recall: in any solution, the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges. For phosphoric acid, the species present would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, H+, and OH-.\n\nSo the charge balance equation should account for all the positive charges (H+ and any cations, but here we assume no other cations except H+) and all the negative charges (the various phosphate anions and OH-). \n\nLet me write that out. The total positive charge comes from [H+], and the total negative charge comes from [H2PO4^-] (which has -1 charge), [HPO4^2-] (-2), [PO4^3-] (-3), and [OH-] (-1). \n\nTo balance charges, the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges:\n\n[H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]\n\nYes, that's exactly what option B states. So B is correct. \n\nOption C: \"Diluting with water increases the degree of ionization, and the solution pH decreases.\"\n\nHmm. Dilution affects weak acids. Phosphoric acid is a weak acid, so diluting it should increase its degree of ionization because Le Chatelier's principle says that adding water shifts the equilibrium to the right (more ionization). However, the pH might not necessarily decrease. Wait, when you dilute an acid, even if it ionizes more, the overall concentration of H+ ions might decrease. Let me think. \n\nSuppose we have a weak acid HA. The degree of ionization (α) increases upon dilution because α is proportional to 1/sqrt(c) for a weak acid. However, the actual concentration of H+ is [H+] = sqrt(Ka*c). If you dilute the solution, c decreases, so [H+] decreases. Since pH is -log[H+], a lower [H+] means a higher pH. Therefore, diluting a weak acid should increase pH, not decrease. \n\nBut wait, the statement says \"the solution pH decreases\". That seems contradictory. So if dilution increases the degree of ionization but the overall effect is a lower [H+] (because concentration effect dominates), pH increases. Therefore, option C is incorrect. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a catch here. For example, if the solution is already very dilute, but in this case, starting from pH 2, which is not extremely dilute. So when you dilute, the pH should go up. Therefore, option C claims that pH decreases, which is wrong. Hence, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Adding NaH2PO4 solid enhances the acidity of the solution.\"\n\nNaH2PO4 is the sodium salt of dihydrogen phosphate. When dissolved in water, it dissociates into Na+ and H2PO4^- ions. Now, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4. Adding H2PO4^- would act as a common ion. According to Le Chatelier's principle, adding H2PO4^- would shift the equilibrium of H3PO4 dissociation to the left, decreasing the ionization of H3PO4. Wait, but the question is about enhancing acidity. \n\nWait, but H2PO4^- can act as both an acid and a base. In solution, H2PO4^- can donate a proton (acting as an acid) to form HPO4^2- or accept a proton to form H3PO4. However, since we are adding it to a solution of H3PO4, adding H2PO4^- would increase the concentration of this species. The acidity of the solution depends on the concentration of H+.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding NaH2PO4 creates a buffer solution. The buffer would resist changes in pH. But does it enhance acidity? If the original solution is just H3PO4, which is a weak acid, adding its conjugate base (H2PO4^-) would make the solution less acidic, because the buffer would tend to maintain pH. However, the statement says it enhances acidity. That seems incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of H2PO4^- can affect the dissociation steps. Let me think. The first dissociation of H3PO4 is H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-. If you add H2PO4^- (from NaH2PO4), according to Le Chatelier, the equilibrium shifts left, decreasing [H+], thus increasing pH. Therefore, the solution becomes less acidic. Therefore, adding NaH2PO4 would decrease acidity, not enhance it. So option D is incorrect. \n\nSo summarizing:\n\nA: Incorrect, because pH=2 implies [H+]=0.01 M, so moles in 1 L is 0.01, not 0.02.\n\nB: Correct, as it's the charge balance equation.\n\nC: Incorrect, because dilution increases degree of ionization but pH increases (becomes less acidic).\n\nD: Incorrect, because adding the conjugate base would decrease acidity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check again for option B. The equation given in B is:\n\nc(H+) = c(H2PO4^-) + 2c(HPO4^-) + 3c(PO4^3-) + c(OH-)\n\nWait, the original option B says \"c(HPO4^-)\" but phosphoric acid's second dissociation is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-, so the second species is HPO4^2-. Therefore, in the charge balance, the coefficient for HPO4^2- should be 2. But in option B, it's written as \"2c(HPO4^-)\", which would be 2 times [HPO4^-], but HPO4^- is not the correct formula. Wait, the second dissociation gives HPO4^2-. So maybe there's a typo in the option? Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original option B says: \"c(H+)=c(H2PO4^-)+2c(HPO4^-)+3c(PO4^3-)+c(OH-)\".\n\nWait, HPO4^- would have a -1 charge, but actually, the second dissociation produces HPO4^2-. So if the option says HPO4^-, that's incorrect. But maybe it's a typo in the problem? Wait, the user wrote:\n\nOption (B): c(H+)=c(H2PO4^-)+2c(HPO4^-)+3c(PO4^3-)+c(OH-)\n\nBut if the correct species after second dissociation is HPO4^2-, then the coefficient for that term should be 2*[HPO4^2-]. However, the option says 2c(HPO4^-), which would be HPO4^- (charge -1), but that's not the correct species. Therefore, is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the problem statement has a typo. Let me check again. The user wrote:\n\n\"Option (B) c(H+)=c(H2PO4^-)+2c(HPO4^-)+3c(PO4^3-)+c(OH-)\"\n\nBut in reality, the correct charge balance should be:\n\n[H+] + [Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]\n\nBut in this case, since there's no Na+ added (unless in option D, but option B is about the original solution). So in the original solution of H3PO4, the only cation is H+. Therefore, the correct charge balance is:\n\n[H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]\n\nBut the option B says \"2c(HPO4^-)\", which is 2*[HPO4^-], but the correct term is 2*[HPO4^2-]. If the problem wrote HPO4^- instead of HPO4^2-, then option B is incorrect. However, if it's a typo and they meant HPO4^2-, then it's correct. \n\nBut since the user wrote \"HPO4^-\", which is HPO4^- (charge -1), but the correct species is HPO4^2- (charge -2). Therefore, unless there's a misunderstanding here, option B is incorrect. But wait, maybe I misread the formula. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nOption (B): c(H+)=c(H2PO4^-)+2c(HPO4^-)+3c(PO4^3-)+c(OH-)\n\nSo the third term is 3c(PO4^3-), which is correct because PO4^3- has charge -3. The second term is 2c(HPO4^-), but HPO4^- would have charge -1, but the correct species is HPO4^2- with charge -2. Therefore, the coefficient for HPO4^2- should be 2, but if the formula is written as HPO4^-, then the coefficient is wrong. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again. Phosphoric acid has three dissociation steps:\n\n1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)\n2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)\n3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)\n\nSo the species present are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, H+, and OH-.\n\nIn the charge balance equation, each anion contributes its charge. So:\n\nPositive charges: [H+]\n\nNegative charges: [H2PO4^-] * (-1) + [HPO4^2-] * (-2) + [PO4^3-] * (-3) + [OH-] * (-1)\n\nTherefore, the charge balance equation is:\n\n[H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]\n\nSo in option B, if it's written as \"2c(HPO4^-)\", but the correct term is 2c(HPO4^2-). Therefore, if the problem says HPO4^-, then option B is incorrect. However, if there was a formatting issue and the user intended HPO4^2- but wrote HPO4^-, then it's correct. \n\nBut looking at the original problem statement from the user, they wrote:\n\n\"Option (B) c(H+)=c(H2PO4^-)+2c(HPO4^-)+3c(PO4^3-)+c(OH-)\"\n\nAssuming that the user intended the charges to be properly noted, maybe in the original problem, the notation is correct. However, given that in standard notation, the second dissociation produces HPO4^2-, so the term should be 2c(HPO4^2-). Therefore, if the option B says 2c(HPO4^-), then it's wrong. But maybe in Chinese or some contexts, the notation is different? Or perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in writing the options. Alternatively, maybe I need to check if there's another way to interpret this. For example, if the problem is in Chinese, maybe the notation is different? But I think standard IUPAC notation is used here. \n\nGiven that, if option B has HPO4^- instead of HPO4^2-, then option B is incorrect. However, if the problem actually says HPO4^2-, then it's correct. But since the user wrote HPO4^-, I need to consider that. \n\nBut this is a critical point. If option B is incorrect due to this, then my previous conclusion that B is correct would be wrong. However, given that the user has presented option B as written, I have to work with that. \n\nBut maybe the problem uses a different notation where HPO4^- is intended to represent HPO4^2-? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way where the charges are omitted in the text but implied. For example, maybe in the original problem, the charges are written with superscripts, and here in the text, they are represented as ^- for each charge. For example, HPO4^2- would be written as HPO4^2- but if it's mistyped as HPO4^-, that would be a mistake. \n\nAssuming that the problem is correctly presented, and the user has a typo, but since I can't verify that, I have to go by what's written. If the option B says 2c(HPO4^-), then it's wrong. However, in reality, the correct term is 2c(HPO4^2-). Therefore, if the problem has a typo and it should be HPO4^2-, then B is correct. But given the information I have, there's a discrepancy here. \n\nThis is a problem. How to resolve this? Well, considering that option B is presented as is, and assuming that it's correctly written in the original problem (maybe the user intended HPO4^2- but mistyped it as HPO4^-), then I have to make a judgment. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at this. Let's think about the overall charge balance. Suppose all the phosphate species are considered. The sum of their charges must balance the H+ and OH-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check again. \n\nThe charge balance equation must satisfy:\n\nSum of positive charges = Sum of negative charges.\n\nPositive charges come from H+ (assuming no other cations).\n\nNegative charges come from:\n\n- H2PO4^- contributes -1 per ion.\n\n- HPO4^2- contributes -2 per ion.\n\n- PO4^3- contributes -3 per ion.\n\n- OH- contributes -1 per ion.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n[H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]\n\nTherefore, if the option B says \"2c(HPO4^-)\", that would mean multiplying [HPO4^-] by 2, but HPO4^- is a -1 charge species. However, the correct species here is HPO4^2-, which is -2. Therefore, if the option B says 2c(HPO4^-), that would be 2*[HPO4^-], which is incorrect. The correct term is 1*[HPO4^-] if it were -1, but since it's actually -2, it should be 2*[HPO4^2-]. \n\nTherefore, unless there's a misunderstanding in the notation, option B as written is incorrect. But this contradicts my earlier conclusion. This is confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses HPO4^- to denote HPO4^2-? For example, maybe the user or the problem uses a shorthand where only one minus is written for simplicity, but actually means the doubly charged ion. That could be possible, though non-standard. If that's the case, then option B would be correct. \n\nGiven that this is a chemistry problem, and standard notation is important, I'm inclined to think that there's a typo in option B. However, since I have to work with the given text, and if I take it literally, then option B is incorrect. But that would mean none of the options are correct, which is unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the charge balance. Let me try to derive it again. \n\nTotal positive charge concentration is [H+].\n\nTotal negative charge concentration is:\n\nFor each species:\n\n- H2PO4^-: concentration is [H2PO4^-], charge is -1 → contribution is 1*[H2PO4^-]\n\n- HPO4^2-: concentration is [HPO4^2-], charge is -2 → contribution is 2*[HPO4^2-]\n\n- PO4^3-: concentration is [PO4^3-], charge is -3 → contribution is 3*[PO4^3-]\n\n- OH-: concentration is [OH-], charge is -1 → contribution is 1*[OH-]\n\nTherefore, total negative charges: [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]\n\nSetting equal to positive charges: [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH-]\n\nThus, if option B says \"2c(HPO4^-)\", where HPO4^- is a -1 charge species, then the equation is wrong. If it's a typo and should be HPO4^2-, then it's correct. \n\nGiven that the problem is from an exam, and options are likely to be correct if they are meant to be correct, I think it's probable that there was a formatting issue, and the correct term is HPO4^2-. Therefore, option B is correct. \n\nTherefore, proceeding with that assumption, option B is correct. \n\nSo, going back, if B is correct, then the correct answer is B. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are B.\n\nBut let me check again for option D. Adding NaH2PO4. Since NaH2PO4 dissociates into Na+ and H2PO4^-. Now, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4. Adding it to the solution of H3PO4 would create a buffer solution. The buffer solution would resist changes in pH. However, does it enhance acidity? \n\nThe acidity is determined by the concentration of H+. In a buffer solution of H3PO4 and H2PO4^-, the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is H2PO4^- and the acid is H3PO4. If we add more H2PO4^-, then if the ratio [base]/[acid] increases, pH increases. Therefore, adding more H2PO4^- would increase the pH, making the solution less acidic. Hence, adding NaH2PO4 would decrease the acidity, so option D is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, only option B is correct. \n\nBut I need to make sure about option B again. If the problem indeed says HPO4^-, then it's wrong. But given that the correct species is HPO4^2-, and assuming that it's a typo in the problem's transcription here, I'll go with B being correct. \n\nSo final conclusion: option B is correct, others are incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
