Then, express β as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. The triangle ABC has sides AB = 12, BC = 25, and CA = 17. The rectangle has P on AB, Q on AC, and R and S on BC. \n\nFirst, I should probably sketch the triangle and the rectangle to visualize the problem. Let me imagine triangle ABC with BC as the base. Points R and S are on BC, so the base of the rectangle is along BC. However, since it's a rectangle, PQ must be parallel to SR, and PS and QR must be perpendicular to SR. But since BC is the base, maybe the rectangle is standing on BC? Wait, but P is on AB and Q is on AC. So the rectangle is inside the triangle, with one side PQ connecting AB to AC, and the other sides SR and PS/QR going down to BC. \n\nI need to find the relationship between the width w = PQ and the height of the rectangle, then compute the area as w * height, which would give me the quadratic expression. The problem says the area is αw - βw², so I need to find β. \n\nFirst, maybe I need coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to triangle ABC. Let me place point B at (0, 0), point C at (25, 0). Then I need to find coordinates of A. Given AB = 12, AC = 17, BC = 25. Wait, but with coordinates, I can use the distance formula. Let me let point A be at (x, y). Then distance from A to B is √[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 12, so x² + y² = 144. Distance from A to C is √[(x - 25)^2 + y²] = 17, so (x - 25)^2 + y² = 289. \n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: (x - 25)^2 + y² - x² - y² = 289 - 144 => (x² - 50x + 625) - x² = 145 => -50x + 625 = 145 => -50x = 145 - 625 = -480 => x = (-480)/(-50) = 9.6. So x = 9.6, which is 48/5. Then plug back into x² + y² = 144: (48/5)^2 + y² = 144. Compute (48/5)^2: 48² = 2304, so 2304/25 + y² = 144. Convert 144 to 25 denominator: 144 * 25 = 3600. So y² = 3600/25 - 2304/25 = (3600 - 2304)/25 = 1296/25. Therefore y = 36/5 = 7.2. So coordinates of A are (48/5, 36/5). \n\nSo coordinates:\nB: (0, 0)\nC: (25, 0)\nA: (48/5, 36/5)\n\nNow, rectangle PQRS. Let me try to define coordinates for P, Q, R, S. Let me assume that S and R are on BC, which is the base from (0,0) to (25,0). Let me suppose that S is to the left of R on BC. Let me denote the coordinates:\n\nLet me let S be at (s, 0) and R be at (r, 0). Since it's a rectangle, then points P and Q will be somewhere above BC. Since PQ is parallel to SR (which is along BC, horizontal), so PQ is horizontal? Wait, BC is horizontal, so if SR is part of BC, then PQ must be parallel to BC. Therefore, PQ is horizontal. Then PS and QR are vertical? But since P is on AB and Q is on AC, maybe not vertical, unless AB and AC are vertical, which they aren't. Wait, need to think more carefully.\n\nSince PQ is parallel to SR (which is along BC, horizontal), so PQ is horizontal. Therefore, the sides PS and QR are perpendicular to PQ, so they are vertical? But since P is on AB and Q is on AC, which are not vertical, the sides PS and QR can't be vertical. Therefore, the rectangle is not aligned with vertical/horizontal unless the triangle is right-angled. Wait, but triangle ABC isn't necessarily right-angled. Wait, but BC is horizontal in my coordinate system, so if PQ is parallel to BC, then PQ is horizontal. Therefore, the sides PS and QR must be perpendicular to BC, meaning they are vertical? But BC is horizontal, so perpendicular is vertical. Therefore, if the sides of the rectangle are perpendicular to BC, then they are vertical. Therefore, if I can model this.\n\nBut point P is on AB and point Q is on AC. Let me think. If PQ is horizontal, then P and Q have the same y-coordinate. Let me denote the height of the rectangle as h. Then since PS is vertical (assuming), then the length from P down to S is h. Similarly, QR is vertical down to R. Therefore, if the rectangle has height h, then the y-coordinate of P and Q is h. Therefore, I can find where on AB and AC the points P and Q are located at height h. Then PQ would be the horizontal distance between those two points, which would be w. Then, since the base of the rectangle is SR on BC, which would be from S to R, and since the rectangle's height is h, the length SR would be equal to PQ? Wait, no, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so PQ = SR and PS = QR. Since SR is on BC, which is horizontal, and PQ is parallel to SR, so PQ is horizontal. Therefore, if I can find, for a given height h, the length PQ = w, then the area is w * h. But the problem says the area is αw - βw², so I need to express h in terms of w, then multiply by w. \n\nTherefore, my goal is to find h as a function of w, then Area = w * h(w) = αw - βw². \n\nSo first, let me find the relationship between h and w. \n\nLet me think about how h relates to the position of the rectangle inside the triangle. Since PQ is at height h, and the triangle has a certain height. Maybe I need to find the height of the triangle ABC first. \n\nEarlier, we found coordinates of A as (48/5, 36/5). Therefore, the height from A to BC is the y-coordinate of A, since BC is on the x-axis. Therefore, height h_triangle = 36/5 = 7.2. \n\nTherefore, when h = 0, the rectangle is at the base BC, and w would be 25. When h = 36/5, the rectangle would be at the top, but PQ would collapse to a point, so w = 0. Therefore, there is an inverse relationship between h and w. \n\nBut how exactly? Let me think. Let me consider similar triangles. If I take a horizontal line at height h inside the triangle, the length of that line segment would be proportional to the remaining height. Since the whole triangle has height H = 36/5, then at height h from the base, the remaining height from the line to the apex A is H - h. Wait, actually, if h is the distance from BC, then the similar triangle above the line PQ would have height H - h. Therefore, the ratio of the similar triangle is (H - h)/H, so the length of PQ would be BC * (H - h)/H. Wait, but BC is 25, so PQ = 25*(H - h)/H. Therefore, w = 25*(H - h)/H. Therefore, solving for h: \n\nw = 25*( (H - h)/H ) => w = 25*(1 - h/H) => w = 25 - (25/H)h => rearranged, h = (25 - w)*(H/25). \n\nBut then Area = w * h = w*(25 - w)*(H/25) = (H/25)*25w - (H/25)w² = H w - (H/25)w². Therefore, comparing to αw - βw², α = H and β = H/25. Therefore β would be (36/5)/25 = 36/125, so m + n = 36 + 125 = 161. But wait, that seems straightforward, but the problem says that the rectangle has vertices R and S on BC, but also P on AB and Q on AC. However, in my reasoning above, I assumed that PQ is a horizontal line cutting the triangle, creating a similar triangle on top. However, in reality, the rectangle is not just a horizontal line but has vertical sides down to BC. However, in this case, if we assume that the top side PQ is horizontal, and the vertical sides go down to BC, then the base SR of the rectangle is also horizontal, same as PQ. However, since the rectangle's sides are vertical, then SR must be shorter than PQ? Wait, no, in a rectangle PQ and SR are equal. Therefore, if PQ is horizontal at height h, and the vertical sides go down to BC, then SR is the same length as PQ, but lying on BC. But BC is 25 units long. However, if PQ is of length w, then SR is also w, lying on BC. Therefore, the horizontal line at height h must intersect AB and AC at points P and Q such that PQ = w, and then the projection down to BC would give SR = w. However, in reality, the horizontal line at height h would have a length longer than w, because the rectangle's base SR is w. Wait, maybe my previous reasoning is flawed because I considered the horizontal line at height h to be PQ, which is w, but if we have a rectangle, then maybe the horizontal line is longer?\n\nWait, no. If the rectangle has PQ parallel to SR (which is on BC), and the sides PS and QR are perpendicular to PQ, then if PQ is horizontal, then PS and QR are vertical. Therefore, starting from PQ, going straight down to BC, so S and R are directly below P and Q. Therefore, if PQ is of length w, then SR is also of length w, located somewhere along BC. Therefore, the horizontal line at height h has a segment PQ of length w, and then directly below it on BC is SR of length w. Therefore, the horizontal line at height h must be such that between AB and AC, the horizontal segment is w, which is shorter than the full horizontal width at that height. Therefore, my previous assumption that w equals 25*(H - h)/H is incorrect because that would be the case if the horizontal line at height h is the entire width of the triangle at that level. However, in our case, the horizontal segment PQ is only part of that width because it's the side of the rectangle, and the rest of the horizontal width is outside the rectangle. Therefore, my previous approach is wrong. I need another method.\n\nLet me think again. Let me use coordinates. Let me parametrize points P on AB and Q on AC such that PQ is horizontal (since the rectangle's side PQ is parallel to BC). Let me denote coordinates:\n\nPoint A: (48/5, 36/5)\n\nPoint B: (0, 0)\n\nPoint C: (25, 0)\n\nParametrize AB: Let me let P be a point on AB. Let me parametrize AB with a parameter t. Let me write parametric equations for AB and AC.\n\nParametrize AB: from B(0,0) to A(48/5, 36/5). Let me use parameter t ∈ [0,1]. So coordinates of P can be expressed as:\n\nP = B + t*(A - B) = ( (48/5)t, (36/5)t )\n\nSimilarly, parametrize AC: from A(48/5, 36/5) to C(25, 0). Let me use parameter s ∈ [0,1]. Coordinates of Q:\n\nQ = A + s*(C - A) = ( 48/5 + s*(25 - 48/5), 36/5 + s*(0 - 36/5) )\n\nCompute 25 - 48/5: 25 is 125/5, so 125/5 - 48/5 = 77/5. Similarly, -36/5.\n\nTherefore, Q = ( 48/5 + (77/5)s, 36/5 - (36/5)s ) = ( (48 + 77s)/5, (36 - 36s)/5 )\n\nNow, since PQ is horizontal, their y-coordinates must be equal. Therefore, the y-coordinate of P equals the y-coordinate of Q.\n\nFrom P: y_P = (36/5)t\n\nFrom Q: y_Q = (36 - 36s)/5\n\nSet equal:\n\n(36/5)t = (36 - 36s)/5 => 36t = 36 - 36s => t = 1 - s.\n\nTherefore, t and s are related by t = 1 - s. Therefore, we can express everything in terms of one variable. Let me choose to use t. So s = 1 - t.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of P: ( (48/5)t, (36/5)t )\n\nCoordinates of Q: ( (48 + 77s)/5, (36 - 36s)/5 ) with s = 1 - t:\n\nCompute x-coordinate of Q: 48 + 77(1 - t) = 48 + 77 - 77t = 125 - 77t. Therefore, x_Q = (125 - 77t)/5.\n\nSimilarly, y-coordinate of Q is (36 - 36(1 - t))/5 = (36 - 36 + 36t)/5 = (36t)/5, which matches y_P, as expected.\n\nTherefore, PQ has coordinates from P( (48t)/5, (36t)/5 ) to Q( (125 - 77t)/5, (36t)/5 ). Therefore, the length PQ = w is the difference in x-coordinates, since y's are the same:\n\nw = x_Q - x_P = [ (125 - 77t)/5 - (48t)/5 ] = [125 - 77t - 48t]/5 = [125 - 125t]/5 = 25(1 - t).\n\nTherefore, w = 25(1 - t) => t = 1 - w/25.\n\nSo t is expressed in terms of w. Now, we need to find the height of the rectangle, which is the y-coordinate of PQ, which is (36/5)t. Since t = 1 - w/25, then height h = (36/5)(1 - w/25).\n\nTherefore, area of rectangle PQRS is w * h = w*(36/5)(1 - w/25) = (36/5)w - (36/5)*(1/25)w² = (36/5)w - (36/125)w². \n\nComparing this with the given expression αw - βw², we have α = 36/5 and β = 36/125. Therefore, β is 36/125, which reduces to 36/125 (since 36 and 125 share no common factors besides 1). Therefore, m = 36, n = 125, so m + n = 161.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe there was a mistake because I thought my first approach was wrong, but this coordinate approach seems to confirm that β is 36/125. However, let me verify with another approach to be safe.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me think about similar triangles. If the rectangle has height h, then as I thought earlier, the similar triangle on top would have height H - h = (36/5 - h). The base of that similar triangle would be BC * (H - h)/H = 25*(H - h)/H. However, this base is equal to PQ, which is w. Therefore, w = 25*(H - h)/H => solving for h: h = H - (w*H)/25. Therefore, h = H*(1 - w/25). Therefore, Area = w*h = w*H*(1 - w/25) = H*w - (H/25)w². Which is same as above. Therefore, β = H/25 = (36/5)/25 = 36/125. So same result. Therefore, seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. Suppose w = 0. Then area should be 0. Plugging in, 0 - β*0 = 0. Correct. When w = 25, area should also be 0, since the rectangle would collapse to the base BC with height 0. Let's check: Area = α*25 - β*(25)^2. According to our formula, α = 36/5, so 36/5 *25 - 36/125 * 625. Compute 36/5 *25 = 36*5 = 180. 36/125 * 625 = 36*(625/125) = 36*5 = 180. Therefore, 180 - 180 = 0. Correct. Another check: when w = 12.5, halfway? Let me compute h. h = (36/5)*(1 - 12.5/25) = (36/5)*(1 - 0.5) = (36/5)*(0.5) = 18/5 = 3.6. Area should be 12.5 * 3.6 = 45. According to formula: αw - βw² = (36/5)(12.5) - (36/125)(12.5)^2. Compute 36/5 * 12.5: 36 * 2.5 = 90. 36/125 * 156.25 = 36*(156.25 / 125) = 36*(1.25) = 45. Therefore, 90 - 45 = 45. Correct. Therefore, seems correct. Therefore, β = 36/125, m + n = 36 + 125 = 161. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"vertices R and S on BC\". In my coordinate approach, I assumed that the rectangle has its base SR on BC, with S and R being the projections of P and Q down to BC. But in reality, since the sides PS and QR are vertical, then yes, if P is at ( (48t)/5, (36t)/5 ), then S would be at ( (48t)/5, 0 ), and R at ( (125 - 77t)/5, 0 ). Therefore, the length SR is x_R - x_S = [ (125 - 77t)/5 - (48t)/5 ] = [125 - 77t - 48t]/5 = 125 - 125t)/5 = 25(1 - t) = w. Which matches PQ's length. Therefore, the rectangle PQRS indeed has PQ = w and SR = w, with PS and QR vertical sides of length h = 36t/5. Therefore, the area is correct. Therefore, my answer is correct. Therefore, β = 36/125, so m + n = 161. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there is any possibility that the rectangle is not having vertical sides. But since PQ is parallel to BC and the rectangle's sides are perpendicular to PQ (which is horizontal), they must be vertical. Therefore, the rectangle must have vertical sides. Therefore, the coordinates approach is valid. Therefore, answer is 161.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{161}\n</think>"}
