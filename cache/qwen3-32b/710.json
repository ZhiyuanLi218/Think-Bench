So, the question is about the Chang'e-1 lunar satellite changing its orbit from a 24-hour orbit to a 48-hour one, and then to a 72-hour orbit before heading to the moon. The question is asking what happens to the satellite's kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy after each orbit change. The options are A to D, with different combinations of increases or decreases in kinetic and potential energy.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic physics concepts about orbits. I remember that when a satellite is in a circular orbit around a planet, its speed depends on the radius of the orbit. The formula for the orbital speed is v equals the square root of (G*M/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the radius of the orbit. So, as the radius increases, the orbital speed decreases. That means if the satellite moves to a higher orbit (larger radius), its kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv², should decrease because the velocity is lower. \n\nBut wait, gravitational potential energy in a gravitational field is given by U = -G*M*m / r. But here, the potential energy becomes less negative as r increases, which means the potential energy itself increases. So if the satellite is moving to a higher orbit, the potential energy increases (becomes less negative) and the kinetic energy decreases. \n\nSo, in this case, each time the satellite changes to a higher orbit (from 24-hour to 48-hour, then to 72-hour), the radius of the orbit is increasing. Therefore, after each orbit change, the kinetic energy should decrease, and the gravitational potential energy should increase. \n\nLooking at the options, option D says kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases. So that would be the correct answer. \n\nBut let me double-check. Sometimes when you do work on the satellite to move it to a higher orbit, you might think that both energies increase, but that's not the case. The kinetic energy actually decreases because the satellite is moving slower in a higher orbit. However, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) increases because potential energy increases more. Since potential energy is negative and becomes less negative, the total energy becomes less negative, which is an increase. \n\nSo, the kinetic energy decreases and the gravitational potential energy increases. Therefore, the correct answer should be option D.\n</think>"}
