Parallax and Distance Relationship**\n\nThe parallax angle $ \\pi $ (in arcseconds) is inversely related to the distance $ d $ (in parsecs):\n\n$$\nd = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\n$$\n\nThis is the key relationship that links the angular measurement (parallax) to the physical distance in space.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Volume Element in Space**\n\nIn a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a spherical shell between distances $ d $ and $ d + dd $ is proportional to the volume of that shell:\n\n$$\ndN \\propto 4\\pi d^2 \\, dd\n$$\n\nThis comes from the surface area of a sphere $ 4\\pi d^2 $ times the infinitesimal thickness $ dd $.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

This is due to the combination of the geometric increase in volume with distance and the nonlinear transformation from distance to parallax.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{D: } \\sim \\frac{1}{\\text{plx}^4}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. The options are A: ~1/plx², B: ~1/plx³, C: ~1/plx, D: ~1/plx⁴. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star from Earth. The parallax angle (plx) is measured in arcseconds, and the distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax angle in arcseconds. So, d ≈ 1/plx. That's a key relationship here.\n\nNow, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let me think about how the distribution of stars in space affects their parallax distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number of stars within a certain volume depends on how that volume changes with distance.\n\nImagine a shell of stars between distance d and d + dd. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere times the thickness of the shell. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd. If the stars are uniformly distributed with a number density n (stars per cubic parsec), then the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.\n\nBut we need to relate this to parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = -1/plx² dplx (taking the derivative). The negative sign indicates that as parallax increases, distance decreases, but since we're interested in the magnitude, we can ignore the sign for now.\n\nSo substituting d = 1/plx into the volume element. Let me write this out:\n\nNumber of stars between plx and plx + dplx would be n * 4π(1/plx)² * |dd|.\n\nBut |dd| is | -1/plx² dplx | = (1/plx²) dplx. Therefore, the number of stars in that parallax range is n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = n * 4π / plx⁴ dplx.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit parallax range (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx⁴. That would suggest the answer is D: ~1/plx⁴. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I did the substitution correctly. Let me re-express:\n\nLet’s denote parallax as π (often written as π, but here it's called plx). So π = 1/d, so d = 1/π. The number of stars between d and d + dd is n * 4πd² dd. Let's express dd in terms of dπ.\n\nDifferentiating d = 1/π:\n\ndd/dπ = -1/π², so dd = -dπ / π². Therefore, the magnitude is dd = dπ / π².\n\nTherefore, substituting into the number of stars:\n\nn * 4πd² * (dπ / π²) = n * 4π (1/π²) * (dπ / π²) ) = n * 4π / π⁴ dπ = n * 4π / π⁴ dπ. Therefore, dN/dπ ∝ 1/π⁴. Hence, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1 over parallax to the fourth power. So the answer would be D: ~1/plx⁴.\n\nBut wait, I've heard before that the number of stars as a function of distance increases with the square of the distance (because of the surface area), but when converting to parallax, there's an extra factor because of the derivative. Let me check another way.\n\nSuppose you have a uniform distribution, so the number of stars out to distance d is proportional to d³ (since volume is proportional to d³). But the number of stars between d and d + dd is proportional to d² dd. But since we're converting to parallax, which is 1/d, we need to find how the number of stars changes with π.\n\nLet me think of it as a change of variables. Let N(π) dπ be the number of stars with parallax between π and π + dπ. Since π = 1/d, then N(π) dπ = n * 4πd² dd. But dd = -dπ / π². Therefore, N(π) dπ = n * 4π (1/π²) * (dπ / π²) ) = n * 4π / π⁴ dπ. Therefore N(π) ∝ 1/π⁴. So the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, I remember in some contexts, like the number of stars brighter than a certain apparent magnitude, there's a similar relation, but maybe different. However, in this case, it's purely a geometric problem assuming uniform distribution. So yes, the math seems right.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of cumulative numbers. The number of stars with parallax greater than π (i.e., closer than 1/π) is proportional to (1/π)³, since volume goes as d³. So N(>π) ∝ 1/π³. Then the differential number per π is the derivative of N(>π) with respect to π, but with a negative sign. Let's do that.\n\nLet’s say N(>π) = k / π³, where k is some constant. Then dN/dπ = -3k / π⁴. The negative sign just indicates that as π increases, the number of stars with larger π decreases, but the magnitude is 3k / π⁴. Therefore, the number of stars per unit π is proportional to 1/π⁴. So again, answer D.\n\nSo both methods lead to D. Therefore, the answer should be D: ~1/plx⁴.\n\nBut let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let me write again:\n\nIf the number of stars out to distance d is proportional to d³, then the number of stars with parallax π ≥ π₀ is proportional to (1/π₀)³. Therefore, if we take the derivative of that with respect to π₀, we get dN/dπ ∝ -3/π⁴, hence the differential number is proportional to 1/π⁴. So yes, same result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: ~1/plx⁴.\n</think>"}
