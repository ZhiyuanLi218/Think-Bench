The pion has momentum p, and I have to express the muon's momentum in terms of its mass mμ, the pion's mass mπ, and p. Also, the neutrino is massless, and we're using units where c=1. Plus, they mention that p is much larger than both mμ and mπ, which might be useful for approximations. Finally, if p is 1 GeV, I need to calculate the actual maximum and minimum values.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts about particle decays. In a decay process, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c, but since c=1, it's just Eν = pν. The muon has both energy and momentum related by Eμ² = pμ² + mμ². The pion's energy is given by Eπ² = p² + mπ². But since p is much larger than mπ, maybe I can approximate Eπ ≈ p?\n\nWait, but the problem says p is much larger than mμ and mπ. So maybe I can use some non-relativistic approximations or maybe some other approach? Hmm. Let me think.\n\nBut first, let's set up the problem properly. Let me consider the decay π+ → μ+ + ν̄₁. The pion is moving with some momentum p. I need to find the possible range of the muon's momentum.\n\nBut since the neutrino is massless, and the decay is into two particles, the muon and the neutrino, their momenta must be in opposite directions to conserve momentum? Wait, no, because the pion is moving with some momentum p, so the total momentum of the decay products must equal p.\n\nBut in the rest frame of the pion, the decay would be symmetric, but here the pion is moving with momentum p. So perhaps I need to analyze this in the lab frame where the pion is moving with momentum p.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to do this in the pion's rest frame, find the muon's momentum there, and then boost to the lab frame? But the problem is that the pion is not at rest; it has momentum p. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the pion's four-momentum as (Eπ, p), since in natural units c=1, the energy is Eπ = sqrt(p² + mπ²). The muon's four-momentum will be (Eμ, pμ), and the neutrino's four-momentum will be (pν, k), where since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its spatial momentum magnitude. However, the direction of the neutrino's momentum is important here. Since there are two particles produced, their momenta must add up to the pion's momentum.\n\nSo, in vector terms: p (pion) = pμ (muon) + pν (neutrino). Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just |pν|, so the total energy conservation gives:\n\nEπ = Eμ + |pν|.\n\nBut since pπ = pμ + pν, we can write pν = p - pμ. However, the neutrino's energy is |pν|, but pν is a vector. Wait, so the neutrino's energy is the magnitude of its momentum vector. Therefore, the energy conservation equation is:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + |p - pμ|.\n\nBut this is a vector equation. However, since we are looking for the maximum and minimum possible momentum of the muon, perhaps we can consider the case where the neutrino is emitted in the same direction as the pion's motion (for minimum muon momentum) or opposite direction (for maximum muon momentum)? Wait, but how does that work?\n\nLet me think. If the neutrino is emitted in the same direction as the pion is moving, then the muon would have to take less momentum to satisfy p = pμ + pν. So if the neutrino is going in the same direction as the pion, then pν is positive, and pμ = p - pν. If pν is positive, then pμ is less than p. Conversely, if the neutrino is emitted in the opposite direction, then pν is negative, so pμ = p - pν would be p + |pν|, which would be larger. Therefore, the maximum momentum of the muon would occur when the neutrino is emitted in the opposite direction, and the minimum when it's emitted in the same direction.\n\nTherefore, we can model this as a one-dimensional problem. Let me assume that all momenta are along the same line, say the x-axis. Let me denote the pion's momentum as p (positive direction). Then, the muon has momentum pμ, and the neutrino has momentum pν. Then:\n\np = pμ + pν.\n\nEnergy conservation:\n\nEπ = Eμ + Eν.\n\nBut Eν = |pν|, since the neutrino is massless. Therefore:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + |pν|.\n\nBut from momentum conservation, pν = p - pμ. However, depending on the direction, pν could be positive or negative. But since |pν| is the absolute value, let's write:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + |p - pμ|.\n\nBut here, p and pμ are scalars along the same direction. Wait, but if neutrino is going opposite direction, then pν = p - pμ would be negative? Wait, no. If pν is in the opposite direction, then pν = -|pν|. But from momentum conservation:\n\np = pμ + pν.\n\nIf pν is in the opposite direction, then pν = -|pν|. Therefore:\n\np = pμ - |pν| => |pν| = pμ - p.\n\nBut since |pν| must be positive, this requires pμ > p. However, if the neutrino is going in the same direction as the pion, then pν is positive, so:\n\np = pμ + pν => pν = p - pμ, and |pν| = p - pμ. For this to be positive, pμ < p.\n\nSo, depending on the direction of the neutrino, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: Neutrino emitted in same direction as pion. Then pν = p - pμ, and energy equation:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + p - pμ.\n\nCase 2: Neutrino emitted opposite direction. Then pν = pμ - p, and energy equation:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + pμ - p.\n\nBut in case 2, since |pν| = pμ - p, which must be positive, so pμ > p. But if p is very large (p >> mμ, mπ), is this possible? Let me check.\n\nBut let's proceed with solving these equations for pμ in both cases.\n\nFirst, let's consider case 1: neutrino emitted in same direction. So equation:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + p - pμ.\n\nLet me denote this as Equation (1).\n\nSimilarly, case 2: neutrino emitted opposite direction:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + pμ - p.\n\nEquation (2).\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum and minimum pμ. Since in case 1, pμ is less than p, and in case 2, pμ is greater than p. Therefore, case 1 gives the minimum pμ, and case 2 gives the maximum pμ. So we need to solve both equations for pμ.\n\nBut solving these equations algebraically might be complicated. Let me try to square both sides to eliminate the square roots.\n\nStarting with Equation (1):\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + p - pμ.\n\nLet me denote S = sqrt(p² + mπ²), and T = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²). Then:\n\nS = T + (p - pμ).\n\nRearranged:\n\nS - (p - pμ) = T.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[S - (p - pμ)]² = T².\n\nWhich is:\n\nS² - 2 S (p - pμ) + (p - pμ)² = pμ² + mμ².\n\nBut S² is p² + mπ². Substitute:\n\np² + mπ² - 2 S (p - pμ) + p² - 2 p pμ + pμ² = pμ² + mμ².\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nLeft side:\n\np² + mπ² - 2 S (p - pμ) + p² - 2 p pμ + pμ².\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2 p² + mπ² - 2 S (p - pμ) - 2 p pμ + pμ².\n\nSet equal to right side:\n\npμ² + mμ².\n\nSubtract right side from both sides:\n\n2 p² + mπ² - 2 S (p - pμ) - 2 p pμ + pμ² - pμ² - mμ² = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 p² + mπ² - mμ² - 2 S (p - pμ) - 2 p pμ = 0.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n2 p² + (mπ² - mμ²) - 2 p pμ - 2 S (p - pμ) = 0.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I need to collect terms with pμ.\n\nLet me write:\n\n-2 p pμ - 2 S (p - pμ) = -2 p pμ - 2 S p + 2 S pμ.\n\nTherefore, the entire equation becomes:\n\n2 p² + (mπ² - mμ²) - 2 S p - 2 p pμ + 2 S pμ = 0.\n\nGroup terms with pμ:\n\n[ -2 p pμ + 2 S pμ ] + [ 2 p² + (mπ² - mμ²) - 2 S p ] = 0.\n\nFactor pμ:\n\npμ ( -2 p + 2 S ) + [ 2 p² + (mπ² - mμ²) - 2 S p ] = 0.\n\nSolve for pμ:\n\npμ = [ 2 S p - 2 p² - (mπ² - mμ²) ] / [ 2 ( S - p ) ].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2 p ( S - p ) - (mπ² - mμ²).\n\nDenominator: 2 ( S - p ).\n\nTherefore:\n\npμ = [ 2 p ( S - p ) - (mπ² - mμ²) ] / [ 2 ( S - p ) ].\n\nSplit into two terms:\n\npμ = p - [ (mπ² - mμ²) / ( 2 ( S - p ) ) ].\n\nSo:\n\npμ = p - [ (mπ² - mμ²) / ( 2 ( S - p ) ) ].\n\nBut S is sqrt(p² + mπ²). Therefore, S - p = sqrt(p² + mπ²) - p. Let me rationalize this denominator.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p:\n\n[ sqrt(p² + mπ²) - p ] * [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p ] = (p² + mπ²) - p² = mπ².\n\nTherefore, 1 / (S - p) = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p ] / mπ².\n\nTherefore, substituting back into pμ:\n\npμ = p - [ (mπ² - mμ²) / 2 ] * [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p ] / mπ².\n\nSimplify:\n\npμ = p - [ (mπ² - mμ²) / (2 mπ²) ] [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p ].\n\nHmm. This seems complicated, but maybe we can simplify further. Also, given that p is much larger than mπ and mμ, perhaps we can approximate sqrt(p² + mπ²) ≈ p + (mπ²)/(2p). Because for large p, sqrt(p² + m²) ≈ p + m²/(2p) - ... So let's use that approximation.\n\nSo let's approximate sqrt(p² + mπ²) ≈ p + mπ²/(2p). Therefore:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) + p ≈ [p + mπ²/(2p)] + p = 2p + mπ²/(2p).\n\nTherefore, substituting into the expression for pμ:\n\npμ ≈ p - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (2 mπ²) ] [ 2p + mπ²/(2p) ].\n\nLet me compute this term by term. First, expand the bracket:\n\n[ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (2 mπ²) ] * 2p = [ (mπ² - mμ²)/mπ² ] * p.\n\nAnd the second term:\n\n[ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (2 mπ²) ] * [ mπ²/(2p) ] = [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (4 p ) ].\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\npμ ≈ p - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/mπ² * p + (mπ² - mμ²)/(4p) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\npμ ≈ p - p [ (mπ² - mμ²)/mπ² ] - [ (mπ² - mμ²) ]/(4p).\n\nSimplify the first two terms:\n\np [ 1 - (mπ² - mμ²)/mπ² ] = p [ (mπ² - (mπ² - mμ²))/mπ² ] = p [ mμ² / mπ² ].\n\nTherefore:\n\npμ ≈ (p mμ²)/mπ² - [ (mπ² - mμ²) ]/(4p).\n\nNow, since p is much larger than mπ and mμ, the second term is negligible compared to the first term. Therefore, approximately:\n\npμ ≈ (p mμ²)/mπ².\n\nSo for case 1, the minimum momentum of the muon is approximately p_min ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²).\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense. For example, in the rest frame of the pion, the muon's momentum is known. Let me recall that in the pion rest frame, the muon and neutrino would have equal and opposite momenta. The energy of the pion is just its rest mass mπ. Then, energy conservation gives mπ = Eμ + Eν. Since the neutrino is massless, Eν = |pν|. And since momentum is conserved, pν = -pμ. Therefore, in the rest frame, |pν| = |pμ|. So mπ = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + |pμ|. Let me solve this equation for pμ. Let me denote |pμ| = q.\n\nThen mπ = sqrt(q² + mμ²) + q. Rearranged:\n\nmπ - q = sqrt(q² + mμ²).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(mπ - q)^2 = q² + mμ².\n\nExpand left side:\n\nmπ² - 2 mπ q + q² = q² + mμ².\n\nCancel q²:\n\nmπ² - 2 mπ q = mμ².\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ).\n\nSo in the rest frame of the pion, the muon has momentum q = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ). Therefore, when we boost to the lab frame where the pion is moving with momentum p, the muon's momentum would depend on the direction of the neutrino. But perhaps my previous approximation is valid for large p.\n\nBut given that p is much larger than mπ, the pion is highly relativistic. So in the lab frame, the pion is moving very fast. When it decays, the muon can have a range of momenta depending on the direction of the neutrino. The minimum momentum occurs when the neutrino is emitted in the same direction as the pion's motion, carrying away more momentum, leaving less for the muon. The maximum occurs when the neutrino is emitted in the opposite direction, so the muon gets more momentum.\n\nBut in the approximation p >> mπ, mμ, perhaps we can use some relativistic approximations.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the case where the pion is ultra-relativistic, so Eπ ≈ p, since mπ is negligible compared to p. Then, energy conservation equations become approximately:\n\nFor case 1 (neutrino in same direction):\n\np ≈ Eμ + (p - pμ).\n\nTherefore:\n\np ≈ sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + p - pμ.\n\nSubtract p from both sides:\n\n0 ≈ sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) - pμ.\n\nWhich implies sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) ≈ pμ, which is true when mμ is negligible compared to pμ. But if pμ is small, then mμ would dominate. Wait, but in this case, if the neutrino is taking away most of the momentum, then pμ is small. But given that p is large, and mμ is small compared to p, perhaps we can approximate sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) ≈ mμ when pμ is small? Wait, but if pμ is small, then yes, sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) ≈ mμ. Therefore, in that case:\n\np ≈ mμ + p - pμ => 0 ≈ mμ - pμ => pμ ≈ mμ.\n\nBut this contradicts our previous result of pμ ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²). Which one is correct?\n\nWait, this suggests that if p is very large, then in case 1, the muon's momentum is approximately mμ. However, earlier approximation gave pμ ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²). Which one is right?\n\nWait, maybe my previous approximation was not valid. Let me check. Let's take the exact expression for case 1:\n\npμ ≈ (p mμ²)/mπ² - [ (mπ² - mμ²) ]/(4p).\n\nBut if p is very large, then the second term is negligible. However, the first term is (p mμ²)/mπ². Let me compare this with the other approach where I approximated Eπ ≈ p and got pμ ≈ mμ.\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nLet me take actual numbers. For example, the pion mass is about 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon mass is about 105.7 MeV/c². Let me compute (mμ² / mπ²) ≈ (105.7²)/(139.6²) ≈ (11170)/(19488) ≈ 0.573. Therefore, if p is 1 GeV, then pμ ≈ 0.573 * 1 GeV ≈ 0.573 GeV. However, if I use the other approach, where pμ ≈ mμ ≈ 0.1057 GeV. These are very different results. Which one is correct?\n\nThis suggests that my two different approximations are conflicting. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go back. The problem is that when I approximated S ≈ p + mπ²/(2p), and then substituted into the expression for pμ, I might have made an error. Let me re-examine that.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\npμ ≈ p - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (2 mπ²) ] [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p ].\n\nThen I approximated sqrt(p² + mπ²) ≈ p + mπ²/(2p), so sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p ≈ 2p + mπ²/(2p). Therefore, substituting:\n\npμ ≈ p - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (2 mπ²) ] [ 2p + mπ²/(2p) ].\n\nExpanding this:\n\npμ ≈ p - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (2 mπ²) * 2p ] - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (2 mπ²) * mπ²/(2p) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\npμ ≈ p - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/mπ² * p ] - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (4p) ].\n\nThen:\n\npμ ≈ p [ 1 - (mπ² - mμ²)/mπ² ] - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (4p) ].\n\nWhich becomes:\n\npμ ≈ p [ mμ² / mπ² ] - [ (mπ² - mμ²)/ (4p) ].\n\nBut if p is very large, then the second term is negligible. So pμ ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²).\n\nHowever, in the other approach, where I approximated Eπ ≈ p, I got pμ ≈ mμ. But these two results are different. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check with actual numbers. Let me take p = 1 GeV, mπ ≈ 0.14 GeV, mμ ≈ 0.106 GeV.\n\nThen p (mμ² / mπ²) ≈ 1 GeV * (0.106² / 0.14²) ≈ 1 * (0.0112 / 0.0196) ≈ 1 * 0.571 ≈ 0.571 GeV.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume Eπ ≈ p, then pμ ≈ mμ ≈ 0.106 GeV.\n\nBut which is correct? Let me try solving Equation (1) numerically with these numbers.\n\nEquation (1) is:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + p - pμ.\n\nLet me plug in p = 1 GeV, mπ = 0.14 GeV, mμ = 0.106 GeV.\n\nLeft side: sqrt(1² + 0.14²) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.0196) ≈ sqrt(1.0196) ≈ 1.0098 GeV.\n\nRight side: sqrt(pμ² + 0.106²) + 1 - pμ.\n\nLet me denote pμ as x. So equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(x² + 0.011236) + 1 - x ≈ 1.0098.\n\nTherefore:\n\nsqrt(x² + 0.011236) ≈ 1.0098 - 1 + x ≈ 0.0098 + x.\n\nTherefore:\n\nsqrt(x² + 0.011236) ≈ x + 0.0098.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx² + 0.011236 ≈ x² + 2 * x * 0.0098 + 0.00009604.\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.011236 ≈ 0.0196 x + 0.00009604.\n\nSubtract 0.00009604:\n\n0.01114 ≈ 0.0196 x.\n\nTherefore:\n\nx ≈ 0.01114 / 0.0196 ≈ 0.568 GeV.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.57 GeV, matching the previous approximation p (mμ² / mπ²) ≈ 0.571 GeV. Therefore, this suggests that the correct approximation is pμ ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²), not pμ ≈ mμ. Therefore, my initial thought that pμ ≈ mμ was wrong because I didn't consider that even though p is large, the relation between the muon momentum and the pion's momentum involves the mass terms squared.\n\nTherefore, the correct approximation is pμ ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²). So that's for case 1, the minimum muon momentum.\n\nSimilarly, let's analyze case 2, where the neutrino is emitted in the opposite direction, leading to maximum muon momentum.\n\nEquation (2):\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + pμ - p.\n\nAgain, let me denote S = sqrt(p² + mπ²), and rearrange:\n\nS + p = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + pμ.\n\nLet me denote T = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²). Then:\n\nS + p = T + pμ.\n\nRearranged:\n\nS + p - pμ = T.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(S + p - pμ)^2 = T² = pμ² + mμ².\n\nExpanding left side:\n\n(S + p - pμ)^2 = (S + p)^2 - 2 (S + p) pμ + pμ².\n\nTherefore:\n\n(S + p)^2 - 2 (S + p) pμ + pμ² = pμ² + mμ².\n\nCancel pμ²:\n\n(S + p)^2 - 2 (S + p) pμ = mμ².\n\nRearrange:\n\n-2 (S + p) pμ = mμ² - (S + p)^2.\n\nTherefore:\n\npμ = [ (S + p)^2 - mμ² ] / [ 2 (S + p) ].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(S + p)^2 - mμ² = (S + p - mμ)(S + p + mμ). But maybe better to divide:\n\npμ = [ (S + p)^2 - mμ² ] / [ 2 (S + p) ] = [ (S + p) - mμ² / (2 (S + p)) ] / 2.\n\nWait, actually:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\npμ = [ (S + p)^2 - mμ² ] / [ 2 (S + p) ] = [ (S + p) - mμ² / (S + p) ] / 2.\n\nYes, because:\n\n[ (S + p)^2 - mμ² ] / [ 2 (S + p) ] = [ (S + p)^2 / (2 (S + p)) ) - mμ² / (2 (S + p)) ] = [ (S + p)/2 - mμ² / (2 (S + p)) ].\n\nTherefore:\n\npμ = [ (S + p)/2 - mμ² / (2 (S + p)) ].\n\nAgain, with S = sqrt(p² + mπ²). Let's use the same approximation for large p, S ≈ p + mπ²/(2p).\n\nTherefore, S + p ≈ 2p + mπ²/(2p).\n\nTherefore:\n\n(S + p)/2 ≈ p + mπ²/(4p).\n\nThen, mμ² / [ 2 (S + p) ] ≈ mμ² / [ 2 (2p + mπ²/(2p)) ] ≈ mμ² / (4p), since the second term in the denominator is negligible for large p.\n\nTherefore, pμ ≈ p + mπ²/(4p) - mμ²/(4p) = p + [mπ² - mμ²]/(4p).\n\nTherefore, for case 2, the maximum muon momentum is approximately p + [mπ² - mμ²]/(4p). Since p is large, the second term is small, so pμ ≈ p. But with a small correction.\n\nBut let me check this with actual numbers again. Let's take p = 1 GeV, mπ = 0.14 GeV, mμ = 0.106 GeV.\n\nCompute pμ using the exact equation:\n\nEquation (2): sqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(pμ² + mμ²) + pμ - p.\n\nLeft side: sqrt(1 + 0.0196) ≈ 1.0098 GeV.\n\nEquation becomes:\n\n1.0098 = sqrt(pμ² + 0.011236) + pμ - 1.\n\nRearranged:\n\nsqrt(pμ² + 0.011236) = 1.0098 - pμ + 1 = 2.0098 - pμ.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\npμ² + 0.011236 = (2.0098 - pμ)^2 = 4.0392 - 4.0196 pμ + pμ².\n\nCancel pμ²:\n\n0.011236 = 4.0392 - 4.0196 pμ.\n\nRearranged:\n\n4.0196 pμ = 4.0392 - 0.011236 ≈ 4.02796.\n\nTherefore:\n\npμ ≈ 4.02796 / 4.0196 ≈ 1.002 GeV.\n\nWhich is approximately 1.002 GeV, very close to p = 1 GeV, with a small correction. According to our approximation, pμ ≈ p + [mπ² - mμ²]/(4p). Let's compute that:\n\n[mπ² - mμ²]/(4p) = [ (0.14² - 0.106²) ] / (4 * 1) ≈ [0.0196 - 0.011236]/4 ≈ 0.008364 / 4 ≈ 0.002091 GeV.\n\nTherefore, pμ ≈ 1 + 0.002091 ≈ 1.002091 GeV, which matches the numerical result of ≈1.002 GeV. Therefore, our approximation is valid.\n\nTherefore, the maximum muon momentum is approximately p + [mπ² - mμ²]/(4p), and the minimum is approximately p (mμ² / mπ²).\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the maximum and minimum momentum of the μ particle, expressed in terms of mμ, mπ, and p\". Also, given that p >> mμ, mπ. Therefore, maybe we can write more precise expressions without approximating?\n\nLet me go back to the exact expressions we derived earlier for pμ in both cases.\n\nFor case 1 (minimum muon momentum):\n\npμ = p - [ (mπ² - mμ²) / (2 mπ²) ] [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p ].\n\nFor case 2 (maximum muon momentum):\n\npμ = [ (S + p)^2 - mμ² ] / [ 2 (S + p) ] where S = sqrt(p² + mπ²).\n\nBut maybe there is a more elegant way to write these expressions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can derive these expressions using another method, such as considering the invariant mass or using Lorentz transformations.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the pion's rest frame and then boosting to the lab frame.\n\nLet me try that approach. In the pion rest frame, the decay products are the muon and the neutrino. As I calculated earlier, in the rest frame, the muon has momentum q = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ). The neutrino has momentum -q.\n\nNow, to find the muon's momentum in the lab frame where the pion has momentum p, we need to perform a Lorentz boost from the pion rest frame to the lab frame.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz boost parameters. The pion is moving with momentum p in the lab frame. In the pion rest frame, the lab frame is moving with velocity v, which we need to determine.\n\nThe energy of the pion in the lab frame is Eπ = sqrt(p² + mπ²). The Lorentz factor γ is Eπ / mπ = sqrt(p² + mπ²)/mπ.\n\nThe velocity β is p / Eπ = p / sqrt(p² + mπ²).\n\nTherefore, β = p / sqrt(p² + mπ²), γ = sqrt(p² + mπ²)/mπ.\n\nNow, the muon in the pion rest frame has momentum q in some direction. To find its momentum in the lab frame, we need to apply the Lorentz boost. However, since the boost is along the direction of the pion's motion (let's assume it's along the x-axis), the direction of the muon's momentum in the rest frame will affect the result.\n\nTo get the maximum and minimum muon momentum in the lab frame, we need to consider the muon's direction in the rest frame. The maximum momentum occurs when the muon is boosted in the same direction as the pion's motion, i.e., when the muon is moving in the direction of the boost. The minimum momentum occurs when the muon is moving opposite to the boost direction.\n\nTherefore, in the rest frame, if the muon is moving in the direction of the boost (lab frame's direction), then after the boost, its momentum will be increased. If it's moving opposite, its momentum will be decreased.\n\nSo let's calculate the muon's momentum in the lab frame for both cases.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum along the boost direction is:\n\np' = γ (p + β E),\n\nwhere p is the momentum in the rest frame, and E is the energy in the rest frame.\n\nIn the pion rest frame, the muon has momentum q (for direction along boost) or -q (for opposite direction). Let's calculate both.\n\nFirst, for the case where the muon is moving in the boost direction (lab frame direction) in the rest frame:\n\np_lab = γ (q + β E_rest).\n\nWhere E_rest is the muon's energy in the rest frame, which is sqrt(q² + mμ²). But in the rest frame decay, we had:\n\nmπ = Eμ + Eν = sqrt(q² + mμ²) + q.\n\nEarlier, we found q = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ).\n\nLet me compute E_rest = sqrt(q² + mμ²). From the energy conservation in rest frame:\n\nmπ = E_rest + q => E_rest = mπ - q.\n\nTherefore, E_rest = mπ - q.\n\nTherefore, substituting into p_lab:\n\np_lab = γ [ q + β (mπ - q) ].\n\nSimilarly, for the case where the muon is moving opposite to the boost direction in the rest frame, its momentum is -q, so:\n\np_lab = γ [ -q + β (mπ - q) ].\n\nTherefore, these are expressions for the maximum and minimum muon momentum in the lab frame.\n\nLet me compute these expressions.\n\nFirst, let's compute γ and β.\n\nγ = sqrt(p² + mπ²)/mπ.\n\nβ = p / sqrt(p² + mπ²).\n\nNow, let's compute for the maximum case:\n\np_max = γ [ q + β (mπ - q) ].\n\nLet me substitute q = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ):\n\nFirst compute q:\n\nq = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ).\n\nCompute β (mπ - q):\n\nβ [ mπ - (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ) ] = β [ (2 mπ² - mπ² + mμ² ) / (2 mπ) ] = β [ (mπ² + mμ² ) / (2 mπ) ].\n\nTherefore:\n\np_max = γ [ (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ) + β (mπ² + mμ² ) / (2 mπ) ].\n\nFactor out 1/(2 mπ):\n\np_max = γ / (2 mπ) [ (mπ² - mμ²) + β (mπ² + mμ²) ].\n\nNow substitute β = p / sqrt(p² + mπ²) and γ = sqrt(p² + mπ²)/mπ:\n\np_max = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²)/mπ / (2 mπ) ] [ (mπ² - mμ²) + (p / sqrt(p² + mπ²)) (mπ² + mμ²) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\np_max = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) / (2 mπ²) ] [ (mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²)/sqrt(p² + mπ²) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np_max = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) (mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ²).\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can combine the terms:\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(p² + mπ²), then:\n\nNumerator = A (mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nLet me square this expression? Not sure. Alternatively, note that for large p, sqrt(p² + mπ²) ≈ p + mπ²/(2p). Let me try expanding for large p.\n\nFirst term: A (mπ² - mμ²) ≈ [p + mπ²/(2p)] (mπ² - mμ²) ≈ p (mπ² - mμ²) + [mπ² (mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p).\n\nSecond term: p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nTherefore, total numerator ≈ p (mπ² - mμ²) + [mπ² (mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p) + p (mπ² + mμ²) = p [ (mπ² - mμ²) + (mπ² + mμ²) ] + [mπ² (mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p).\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(mπ² - mμ²) + (mπ² + mμ²) = 2 mπ².\n\nTherefore, numerator ≈ p * 2 mπ² + [mπ² (mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p).\n\nTherefore, p_max ≈ [ 2 mπ² p + ... ] / (2 mπ² ) ≈ p + [ mπ² (mπ² - mμ²) ] / (4 p mπ² ) ≈ p + (mπ² - mμ²)/(4p).\n\nWhich matches our previous approximation for p_max. Therefore, for large p, p_max ≈ p + (mπ² - mμ²)/(4p). Similarly, for the minimum case.\n\nNow, let's compute p_min, which is when the muon is moving opposite to the boost direction in the rest frame. The expression is:\n\np_min = γ [ -q + β (mπ - q) ].\n\nAgain, substituting q and β:\n\np_min = γ [ - (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ) + β (mπ - (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ)) ].\n\nWhich is similar to the previous case but with a negative sign for the first term. Let me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute the terms inside:\n\n- q + β (mπ - q) = - q + β mπ - β q = -q (1 + β) + β mπ.\n\nBut let me compute it step by step:\n\np_min = γ [ -q + β (mπ - q) ].\n\nAs before, mπ - q = E_rest = mπ - q = [ 2 mπ² - mπ² + mμ² ] / (2 mπ) = [ mπ² + mμ² ] / (2 mπ).\n\nTherefore:\n\np_min = γ [ -q + β * (mπ² + mμ²)/(2 mπ) ].\n\nSubstituting q = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ):\n\np_min = γ [ - (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ) + β (mπ² + mμ²)/(2 mπ) ].\n\nFactor out 1/(2 mπ):\n\np_min = γ / (2 mπ) [ - (mπ² - mμ²) + β (mπ² + mμ²) ].\n\nAgain, substituting γ and β:\n\np_min = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²)/mπ / (2 mπ) ] [ - (mπ² - mμ²) + (p / sqrt(p² + mπ²)) (mπ² + mμ²) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\np_min = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²) / (2 mπ²) ] [ - (mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²)/sqrt(p² + mπ²) ].\n\nAgain, let me denote A = sqrt(p² + mπ²):\n\nNumerator = -A (mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nFor large p, approximate A ≈ p + mπ²/(2p):\n\nFirst term: -A (mπ² - mμ²) ≈ - [ p + mπ²/(2p) ] (mπ² - mμ²) ≈ -p (mπ² - mμ²) - [mπ² (mπ² - mμ²) ]/(2p).\n\nSecond term: + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nTherefore, total numerator ≈ -p (mπ² - mμ²) - [ ... ] + p (mπ² + mμ²) = p [ - (mπ² - mμ²) + (mπ² + mμ²) ] - [ ... ] = p [ 2 mμ² ] - [ ... ].\n\nTherefore, numerator ≈ 2 p mμ² - [ mπ² (mπ² - mμ²) ]/(2p).\n\nTherefore, p_min ≈ [ 2 p mμ² - ... ] / (2 mπ² ) ≈ (2 p mμ² ) / (2 mπ² ) - ... ≈ p (mμ² / mπ² ) - ... which matches our previous approximation.\n\nTherefore, the exact expressions are:\n\np_max = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ² )\n\nand\n\np_min = [ - sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ² )\n\nWait, no. Wait, the numerator for p_min is -A (mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²). So:\n\np_min = [ - sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ² )\n\nBut this seems asymmetric. However, note that if we consider the maximum and minimum, perhaps there's a better way to write them. Alternatively, maybe we can rationalize these expressions.\n\nLet me consider p_max and p_min expressions:\n\nFor p_max:\n\nNumerator: sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nLet me multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(p² + mπ²) - p to rationalize? Not sure. Alternatively, consider squaring or other manipulations.\n\nAlternatively, note that for p_max, we can write:\n\nLet me denote the numerator as N_max = sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nLet me factor out (mπ² - mμ²):\n\nN_max = (mπ² - mμ²) sqrt(p² + mπ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nBut I don't see an immediate simplification. However, if we consider the exact expressions derived earlier for p_max and p_min, and given that the problem asks to express them in terms of mμ, mπ, and p, perhaps these are acceptable answers? However, they seem complicated. But maybe we can write them in a more compact form.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the rest frame, the muon's momentum is q = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ). When boosting, the maximum and minimum momenta can be related to this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to write p_max and p_min using the velocity β and γ?\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in general, when boosting a particle with rest frame momentum q in the direction of the boost, the lab frame momentum is γ (q + β E_rest), where E_rest is the rest frame energy. For the muon, E_rest = mπ - q, as established earlier.\n\nTherefore, for the maximum case:\n\np_max = γ [ q + β (mπ - q) ].\n\nSimilarly, for the minimum case:\n\np_min = γ [ -q + β (mπ - q) ].\n\nBut since γ = Eπ / mπ, and β = p / Eπ.\n\nTherefore:\n\np_max = (Eπ / mπ) [ q + (p / Eπ)(mπ - q) ] = (Eπ q)/mπ + p (mπ - q)/mπ.\n\nSimilarly:\n\np_max = [ Eπ q + p (mπ - q) ] / mπ.\n\nSimilarly for p_min:\n\np_min = [ Eπ (-q) + p (mπ - q) ] / mπ = [ - Eπ q + p (mπ - q) ] / mπ.\n\nNow, let's compute these expressions.\n\nFirst, compute q = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ).\n\nTherefore:\n\nEπ q = sqrt(p² + mπ²) * (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ).\n\nAnd p (mπ - q) = p [ mπ - (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ) ] = p [ (2 mπ² - mπ² + mμ² ) / (2 mπ) ] = p [ (mπ² + mμ² ) / (2 mπ) ].\n\nTherefore, p_max = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ) + p (mπ² + mμ² )/(2 mπ) ] / mπ ?\n\nWait no, the entire numerator is Eπ q + p (mπ - q), which is:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ) + p (mπ² + mμ² )/(2 mπ).\n\nThen divide by mπ:\n\np_max = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ²).\n\nWhich is the same expression as before. Similarly for p_min:\n\np_min = [ - sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ²).\n\nTherefore, these are the exact expressions for p_max and p_min.\n\nGiven that the problem says to express them in terms of mμ, mπ, and p, and given that p >> mπ, mμ, we can approximate these expressions.\n\nFor p_max:\n\nNumerator ≈ sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nAs before, sqrt(p² + mπ²) ≈ p + mπ²/(2p).\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumerator ≈ [p + mπ²/(2p)] (mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nExpanding:\n\n≈ p(mπ² - mμ²) + [mπ²(mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p) + p(mπ² + mμ²).\n\nCombine terms:\n\n≈ p[ (mπ² - mμ²) + (mπ² + mμ²) ] + [mπ²(mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p).\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(mπ² - mμ²) + (mπ² + mμ²) = 2 mπ².\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumerator ≈ 2 p mπ² + [mπ²(mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p).\n\nTherefore, p_max ≈ [ 2 p mπ² + ... ] / (2 mπ² ) ≈ p + [mπ²(mπ² - mμ²)] / [4 p mπ² ] = p + (mπ² - mμ²)/(4p).\n\nSimilarly, for p_min:\n\nNumerator ≈ - [p + mπ²/(2p)](mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nExpanding:\n\n≈ -p(mπ² - mμ²) - [mπ²(mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p) + p(mπ² + mμ²).\n\nCombine terms:\n\n≈ p[ - (mπ² - mμ²) + (mπ² + mμ²) ] - [mπ²(mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p).\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n- (mπ² - mμ²) + (mπ² + mμ²) = 2 mμ².\n\nTherefore, numerator ≈ 2 p mμ² - [mπ²(mπ² - mμ²)]/(2p).\n\nTherefore, p_min ≈ [ 2 p mμ² - ... ] / (2 mπ² ) ≈ (p mμ²)/mπ² - [mπ²(mπ² - mμ²)]/(4 p mπ² ) ≈ p (mμ² / mπ² ) - [ (mπ² - mμ²) ]/(4p).\n\nTherefore, the approximations for p_max and p_min when p >> mπ, mμ are:\n\np_max ≈ p + (mπ² - mμ²)/(4p),\n\np_min ≈ p (mμ² / mπ² ) - [ (mπ² - mμ²) ]/(4p).\n\nBut since p is much larger than mπ and mμ, the second term in p_min is negligible compared to the first term, and the second term in p_max is negligible compared to p. Therefore, approximately:\n\np_max ≈ p,\n\np_min ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²).\n\nHowever, the problem says \"expressed in terms of mμ, mπ, and p\", and it might expect the exact expressions or the leading terms in the approximation. Given that p >> mπ, mμ, the leading terms are p_max ≈ p and p_min ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²). However, the exact expressions are more complicated. But maybe there is a way to write them more neatly?\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the exact expressions for p_max and p_min are:\n\np_max = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ² )\n\nand\n\np_min = [ - sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ² )\n\nBut perhaps these can be simplified further. Let me try squaring or other operations.\n\nAlternatively, consider that these expressions resemble the solution to a quadratic equation. But I think they are as simplified as they can be unless there's some identity I'm missing.\n\nHowever, given that the problem states p >> mπ, mμ, and asks to express the answer in terms of those quantities, it's likely acceptable to use the approximations we derived:\n\np_max ≈ p + (mπ² - mμ²)/(4p),\n\np_min ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²).\n\nBut to check if these are the correct leading terms, let's consider the case where p is very large.\n\nFor p_max, the leading term is p, and the correction is small. For p_min, the leading term is p (mμ² / mπ²), which is less than p since mμ < mπ (for pion decay into muon, the pion mass is larger than the muon mass). Indeed, the pion mass is about 139.6 MeV, and the muon mass is about 105.7 MeV, so mμ² / mπ² ≈ 0.57, so p_min ≈ 0.57 p, which is less than p, as expected.\n\nTherefore, if we are to write the maximum and minimum momenta in terms of mμ, mπ, and p, with the approximation p >> mπ, mμ, then:\n\np_max ≈ p,\n\np_min ≈ (mμ² / mπ²) p.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the maximum and minimum momentum of the μ particle, expressed in terms of mμ, mπ, and p\". It might expect the exact expressions or the approximated ones. Given that p >> mπ, mμ, and the exact expressions are complicated, but the approximations are simple, and the numerical example with p = 1 GeV gives us p_min ≈ 0.57 GeV and p_max ≈ 1.002 GeV, which is very close to p, the approximations seem acceptable.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's an exact relation. For instance, in the rest frame of the pion, the muon has momentum q = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ). When boosted to the lab frame, the muon's momentum depends on its direction. The maximum and minimum are achieved when the muon is moving along or opposite to the boost direction.\n\nThe relation between the lab frame momentum and the rest frame momentum is given by the Lorentz transformation. The exact expressions we derived earlier are:\n\np_max = [ sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ² )\n\nand\n\np_min = [ - sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ² )\n\nBut maybe we can rationalize these expressions? Let me try multiplying numerator and denominator by something.\n\nAlternatively, consider squaring p_max and p_min, but that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, think of the expressions as follows:\n\nFor p_max:\n\nLet me write the numerator as:\n\nsqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²).\n\nLet me denote mπ² - mμ² = Δ, and mπ² + mμ² = Σ.\n\nThen numerator is sqrt(p² + mπ²) Δ + p Σ.\n\nBut I don't see an immediate simplification.\n\nAlternatively, if we square the numerator:\n\n[sqrt(p² + mπ²) Δ + p Σ]^2 = (p² + mπ²) Δ² + 2 p Σ sqrt(p² + mπ²) Δ + p² Σ².\n\nThis seems more complex.\n\nGiven that the problem allows us to use the approximation p >> mπ, mμ, and asks for the answer expressed in terms of the given quantities, I think it's safe to present the approximate results:\n\np_max ≈ p,\n\np_min ≈ (mμ² / mπ²) p.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there's a standard formula for this. In general, for a decay of a particle with momentum P into two particles, the maximum and minimum momenta of one of the decay products can be found by considering the direction of the other particle's momentum. For a relativistic parent particle, the maximum momentum of the daughter particle is approximately the parent's momentum, and the minimum is determined by the mass ratio squared.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer expected here is p_min = p (mμ² / mπ²) and p_max ≈ p. However, since the exact expression for p_max has a small correction, and the problem says p >> mπ, mμ, it might want the leading term. Similarly for p_min.\n\nTherefore, the final answers would be:\n\nMaximum momentum of μ: approximately p,\n\nMinimum momentum of μ: approximately p (mμ² / mπ²).\n\nBut to write them in terms of the given variables without approximation, it's more precise to use the exact expressions, but given the approximation is valid, and the problem mentions p >> mμ, mπ, the approximate expressions are acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem also asks: If p = 1 GeV, calculate the maximum and minimum momentum of the μ particle.\n\nGiven that, let's compute these values.\n\nFirst, we need the values of mπ and mμ. Let me recall:\n\nThe pion mass (π+) is approximately 139.6 MeV/c².\n\nThe muon mass is approximately 105.7 MeV/c².\n\nConverting these to GeV:\n\nmπ ≈ 0.1396 GeV,\n\nmμ ≈ 0.1057 GeV.\n\nTherefore, compute p_min ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²):\n\np_min ≈ 1 GeV * (0.1057² / 0.1396²) ≈ 1 * (0.01117 / 0.01949) ≈ 1 * 0.573 ≈ 0.573 GeV.\n\nFor p_max ≈ p + (mπ² - mμ²)/(4p):\n\nFirst compute mπ² - mμ²:\n\n(0.1396² - 0.1057²) GeV² ≈ (0.01949 - 0.01117) GeV² ≈ 0.00832 GeV².\n\nThen divide by 4p = 4 * 1 GeV = 4 GeV:\n\n0.00832 GeV² / 4 GeV = 0.00208 GeV.\n\nTherefore, p_max ≈ 1 GeV + 0.00208 GeV ≈ 1.00208 GeV ≈ 1.002 GeV.\n\nTherefore, with p = 1 GeV, the minimum muon momentum is approximately 0.573 GeV and the maximum is approximately 1.002 GeV.\n\nBut let me check with the exact expressions for p_min and p_max.\n\nFor p_min, using the exact expression:\n\np_min = [ - sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ] / (2 mπ² )\n\nLet me compute this with p = 1 GeV, mπ = 0.1396 GeV, mμ = 0.1057 GeV.\n\nFirst compute sqrt(p² + mπ²) = sqrt(1² + 0.1396²) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.0195) ≈ 1.0097 GeV.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-1.0097 GeV * (0.1396² - 0.1057²) + 1 GeV * (0.1396² + 0.1057²).\n\nFirst compute mπ² - mμ² ≈ 0.01949 - 0.01117 ≈ 0.00832 GeV².\n\nThen:\n\n-1.0097 * 0.00832 ≈ -0.00840 GeV³.\n\nNext, compute mπ² + mμ² ≈ 0.01949 + 0.01117 ≈ 0.03066 GeV².\n\nThen:\n\n+1 GeV * 0.03066 GeV² = +0.03066 GeV³.\n\nWait, no, units are inconsistent. Wait, the first term is -sqrt(...) * (mπ² - mμ²), which is -GeV * GeV² = -GeV³? No, that can't be. Wait, no, mπ² - mμ² has units of GeV². sqrt(p² + mπ²) has units of GeV. So multiplying gives GeV³? But the second term is p * (mπ² + mμ²), which is GeV * GeV² = GeV³. So the numerator is in GeV³. Then, dividing by 2 mπ² (GeV²) gives GeV.\n\nOkay, proceeding:\n\nNumerator ≈ -0.00840 GeV³ + 0.03066 GeV³ ≈ 0.02226 GeV³.\n\nDivide by 2 mπ² = 2 * 0.01949 GeV² ≈ 0.03898 GeV².\n\nTherefore, p_min ≈ 0.02226 / 0.03898 ≈ 0.571 GeV, which matches our approximation of 0.573 GeV (small difference due to rounding).\n\nSimilarly, compute p_max:\n\nNumerator = sqrt(p² + mπ²)(mπ² - mμ²) + p (mπ² + mμ²) ≈ 1.0097 * 0.00832 + 1 * 0.03066 ≈ 0.00840 + 0.03066 ≈ 0.03906 GeV³.\n\nDivide by 2 mπ² ≈ 0.03898 GeV²:\n\np_max ≈ 0.03906 / 0.03898 ≈ 1.002 GeV, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the exact values are approximately 0.571 GeV and 1.002 GeV for p = 1 GeV.\n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nThe maximum momentum of the muon is approximately equal to the pion's momentum p, and the minimum is approximately p multiplied by the square of the muon mass over the square of the pion mass. When p = 1 GeV, these values are approximately 1.002 GeV and 0.571 GeV respectively.\n\nBut the problem says to express the answers in terms of mμ, mπ, and p. Given that, and considering the approximation p >> mπ, mμ, the answers are:\n\np_max ≈ p,\n\np_min ≈ p (mμ² / mπ²).\n\nHowever, if the problem expects the exact expressions without approximation, then it would be the more complicated ones. But given the approximation is valid and the problem mentions p >> mμ, mπ, I think the approximate expressions are acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nMaximum momentum: p,\n\nMinimum momentum: p (mμ² / mπ²).\n\nBut to be precise, since the exact expression for p_max is slightly larger than p, and for p_min slightly less than p (mμ² / mπ²), but with p >> mπ, these corrections are negligible. Hence, the problem likely expects these expressions.\n\n**Final Answer**\nFor the given decay process, the maximum momentum of the muon is approximately $ \\boxed{p} $ and the minimum momentum is approximately $ \\boxed{\\frac{p m_{\\mu}^2}{m_{\\pi}^2}} $.
