Let me start by recalling what electrolysis is. Electrolysis is a process where an electric current is passed through a substance to cause a chemical change, typically breaking it down into its constituent elements. Since the question is about molten magnesium bromide, I know that in the molten state, the ionic compound will dissociate into its ions: magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) and bromide ions (Br⁻).\n\nNow, in electrolysis, the anode is the positive electrode, and the cathode is the negative electrode. But wait, I need to remember the direction of electron flow and what happens at each electrode. Electrons flow from the anode to the cathode. But for electrolysis, the anode is where oxidation occurs, and the cathode is where reduction occurs. Right, oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons.\n\nSo, in the case of molten magnesium bromide, the magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are going to be attracted to the cathode (negative electrode) because they are positive. Similarly, the bromide ions (Br⁻) are going to be attracted to the anode (positive electrode) because they are negative. \n\nAt the cathode, the Mg²⁺ ions will gain electrons. Since each Mg²⁺ ion needs two electrons to become neutral magnesium metal. The reaction at the cathode would be: Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Mg (reduction).\n\nAt the anode, the Br⁻ ions will lose electrons. Each Br⁻ ion loses one electron to become a Br atom. Since there are two Br⁻ ions needed to make one Br₂ molecule, the reaction at the anode would be: 2Br⁻ → Br₂ + 2e⁻ (oxidation).\n\nSo putting that together, magnesium metal is produced at the cathode, and bromine gas is produced at the anode. Let me check if there's any possibility of other products. For example, sometimes in aqueous solutions, water can interfere, but here it's molten, so there's no water to consider. Therefore, the only products should be magnesium and bromine. \n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nA: magnesium at the anode and bromine at the cathode – this swaps the positions, so incorrect.\n\nB: magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode – this matches my reasoning.\n\nC: magnesium at the cathode and oxygen at the anode – oxygen would come from water or oxide ions, but here we have bromide, so this is incorrect.\n\nD: bromine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode – hydrogen would come from water or H+ ions, which aren't present in molten MgBr₂, so D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>"}
