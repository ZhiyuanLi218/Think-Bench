I need to figure out which of the given options (CO2, CH4, C5H12, C8H18) is the unknown gas. Hmm, I remember something about Graham's Law from chemistry class. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nGraham's Law is about the rate of effusion of gases, right? It states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. So, the formula is something like Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1), where Rate1 and Rate2 are the effusion rates of the two gases, and M1 and M2 are their respective molar masses. \n\nIn this problem, helium is effusing 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas. Let me write that down. So, Rate of He / Rate of unknown gas = 5.33. According to Graham's Law, that should equal sqrt(M of unknown / M of He). Wait, let me make sure I have that right. Since the rate is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass, if He is faster, then the molar mass of the unknown gas must be higher. \n\nLet me write the formula properly. Rate1 / Rate2 = sqrt(M2 / M1). Here, Rate1 is the rate of He, Rate2 is the rate of the unknown gas. So substituting, 5.33 = sqrt(M2 / M1). M1 is the molar mass of He, which is 4 g/mol. So solving for M2, which is the molar mass of the unknown gas.\n\nSo squaring both sides: (5.33)^2 = M2 / 4. Then M2 = 4 * (5.33)^2. Let me calculate that. 5.33 squared is... let me compute that. 5 squared is 25, 0.33 squared is about 0.1089, and then cross terms 2*5*0.33 = 3.3. So total is 25 + 3.3 + 0.1089 ≈ 28.4089. But wait, that's if it's (5 + 0.33)^2. Alternatively, maybe I should just do 5.33 * 5.33. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n5.33 * 5.33. Let me do 5 * 5.33 = 26.65. Then 0.33 * 5.33. Let me compute 0.3 * 5.33 = 1.599, and 0.03 * 5.33 = 0.1599. Adding those gives 1.599 + 0.1599 = 1.7589. So total is 26.65 + 1.7589 = 28.4089. So yeah, about 28.41. Then multiply by 4: 28.41 * 4 = 113.64 g/mol. So the molar mass of the unknown gas should be approximately 113.64 g/mol.\n\nNow, let's check the molar masses of the given options.\n\nOption A: CO2. Carbon is 12, oxygen is 16. So 12 + 2*16 = 12 + 32 = 44 g/mol. That's way lower than 113.64. So probably not A.\n\nOption B: CH4. Carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1. 12 + 4*1 = 16 g/mol. That's even lower. So B is out.\n\nOption C: C5H12. Let's calculate that. Carbon is 12*5 = 60, hydrogen is 12*1 = 12. Total is 60 + 12 = 72 g/mol. Still lower than 113.64. So C is not it.\n\nOption D: C8H18. Carbon is 12*8 = 96, hydrogen is 18*1 = 18. Total is 96 + 18 = 114 g/mol. Oh, that's very close to the calculated 113.64 g/mol. Considering possible rounding differences in the problem, this must be the correct answer. \n\nWait, let me check again. The calculation was approximately 113.64 g/mol. C8H18 is 114 g/mol. That's a very close match. So D is the most likely answer. \n\nBut let me double-check my Graham's Law application. The formula is Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). Since He is effusing faster, Rate1 (He) / Rate2 (unknown) = 5.33. So yes, that equals sqrt(M2 / M1). Therefore, solving for M2 gives M2 = M1*(Rate1/Rate2)^2. Which is 4*(5.33)^2 = 4*28.4 ≈ 113.6. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the unknown gas with molar mass ~114 g/mol is C8H18, which is octane. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
