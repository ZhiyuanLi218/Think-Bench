So, the compound is a tri-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The 1H NMR data given is:\n\n7.1 ppm (1H, singlet), 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet), 6.7 ppm (1H, doublet), 3.7 ppm (3H, singlet), 2.3 ppm (3H, singlet).\n\nFirst, I need to remember how aromatic protons typically show up in NMR. Usually, aromatic protons are in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm. The substituents can cause shifts—electron-withdrawing groups usually deshield the protons, making them more downfield (higher ppm), while electron-donating groups can shield them, making them more upfield (lower ppm).\n\nThe compound is tri-substituted, so there are three different substituents on the benzene ring. Let me look at the options given:\n\nA: 5-Chloro-1,3-xylene\nB: 3-Chloro-4-methoxytoluene\nC: 2-Chloro-1,4-xylene\nD: 3-Chloro-4-methoxyphenol\n\nLet me break down each option.\n\nFirst, xylene is dimethylbenzene. 1,3-xylene (also called meta-xylene) has methyl groups on positions 1 and 3. Adding a chloro group on position 5 would make it 5-Chloro-1,3-xylene (option A). Similarly, option C is 2-Chloro-1,4-xylene, which is 1,4-dimethylbenzene (para-xylene) with a chloro on position 2.\n\nOption B is 3-Chloro-4-methoxytoluene. Toluene is methylbenzene. So if it's 4-methoxy (meaning methoxy on position 4) and chloro on position 3, and the methyl from toluene would be... Wait, toluene has a methyl group already. So 4-methoxytoluene would have a methyl and a methoxy group? Wait, but the name is 3-Chloro-4-methoxytoluene. So the base is toluene (methylbenzene), with chloro on position 3 and methoxy on position 4. So the substituents would be: CH3 (from toluene), Cl, and OCH3. So that's three substituents. So the ring would have a methyl (from toluene), a chloro, and a methoxy.\n\nOption D is 3-Chloro-4-methoxyphenol. Phenol has an -OH group. So substituents would be Cl, OCH3, and OH. But the NMR data given doesn't show an OH proton. Phenol's OH protons are usually in the range of 4-8 ppm but are often broad and exchangeable. However, in the given data, there are no broad signals or OH protons. So maybe D is not the right answer because there's no signal for the phenol -OH. Let's tentatively eliminate D.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR data: three aromatic protons (1H each) and two singlets for aliphatic groups (3H each at 3.7 and 2.3 ppm). The 3.7 ppm is likely a methoxy group (OCH3), since methoxy protons are typically around 3.7-4.0 ppm. The 2.3 ppm is probably a methyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring (like a methyl on the ring). So in the options, we need a compound that has a methoxy (OCH3) and a methyl (CH3) group, plus a chloro.\n\nLooking at options B and D. D has a phenol OH, which we don't see in the NMR. So B is more likely. But let's check the aromatic protons.\n\nThe aromatic region has three signals: 7.1 (s), 7.0 (d), 6.7 (d). Let's think about the substitution pattern. Since the compound is tri-substituted, the substituents will affect the splitting patterns.\n\nOption B: 3-Chloro-4-methoxytoluene. Let's draw the structure mentally. The base is toluene (methylbenzene). The substituents are:\n\n- A methyl (from toluene) on position 1 (assuming the toluene is 1-methyl),\n- A methoxy (OCH3) on position 4,\n- A chloro on position 3.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nPositions on the benzene ring:\n\n1: CH3 (from toluene)\n3: Cl\n4: OCH3\n\nSo the ring is substituted with Cl, OCH3, and CH3. Let's consider the aromatic protons. The substituents will cause different chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\n\nIn a benzene ring with three substituents, the number of aromatic protons depends on the symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, some protons will be equivalent.\n\nIn option B, substituents are at positions 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 4 (OCH3). Let's visualize the ring:\n\nPositions:\n\n1: CH3\n\n2: ?\n\n3: Cl\n\n4: OCH3\n\n5: ?\n\n6: ?\n\nSo the substituents are at 1, 3, and 4. Let's consider the remaining positions (2, 5, 6). The protons at these positions will be influenced by the substituents.\n\nBut since there are three substituents, the ring will have three different types of protons. Let's see:\n\nThe substituents are:\n\n- CH3 (position 1)\n- Cl (position 3)\n- OCH3 (position 4)\n\nThe aromatic protons would be on positions 2, 5, and 6.\n\nLet's analyze each:\n\nPosition 2: adjacent to Cl (position 3) and CH3 (position 1). The proton here is between Cl and CH3. The substituents are on positions 1 and 3. Position 2 is between them. Depending on the substituent effects, this proton may be split by adjacent protons.\n\nPosition 5: adjacent to OCH3 (position 4) and CH3 (position 1). Position 5 is between position 4 (OCH3) and position 6. Wait, position 5 is adjacent to position 4 (OCH3) and position 6. Hmm.\n\nPosition 6: adjacent to OCH3 (position 4) and Cl (position 3). Position 6 is between position 5 and position 1 (CH3). Wait, maybe I need to draw this out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the substitution pattern. Since the substituents are at positions 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 4 (OCH3), the ring is not symmetric. Let me check if there's any symmetry. If there's a plane of symmetry, some protons might be equivalent.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nIf we consider positions 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 4 (OCH3), the ring might have a symmetry if the substituents are arranged in a way that positions 2 and 6 are equivalent? Let me check:\n\nPosition 2 is between CH3 (1) and Cl (3). Position 6 is between OCH3 (4) and CH3 (1). Are these positions symmetric? If we flip the ring, position 2 would correspond to position 6 if there's a symmetry. But with Cl at 3 and OCH3 at 4, maybe not. So positions 2, 5, and 6 might all be different, leading to three different aromatic protons.\n\nIn the NMR data, there are three aromatic protons: one singlet, one doublet, and another doublet. Let's think about the splitting.\n\nIf a proton has neighboring protons (i.e., adjacent to other aromatic protons), it will split. In a benzene ring, each proton can have two neighbors, leading to splitting. However, if the substituents cause some protons to be equivalent or if there's a lack of protons in certain positions, the splitting patterns will change.\n\nFor example, if a proton is between two substituents and has no neighboring protons, it might appear as a singlet. Let's see.\n\nIn option B's structure, if the substituents are at 1, 3, and 4, then the protons at positions 2, 5, and 6 are present. Let's analyze each:\n\n- Position 2: adjacent to Cl (position 3) and CH3 (position 1). The proton here is between position 1 (CH3) and position 3 (Cl). The neighboring protons would be position 2's neighbors. Wait, in a benzene ring, each proton is adjacent to two other protons. So position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (CH3) and position 3 (Cl). Wait, no, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 and position 3? No, in a benzene ring, each carbon is adjacent to two others. So position 2 is adjacent to position 1 and position 3? Wait, position 1 is CH3, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 and position 3. But position 3 has a Cl. So the proton at position 2 is between position 1 (CH3) and position 3 (Cl). The protons on positions 1 and 3 are not aromatic (since they have substituents). Wait, the aromatic protons are on the ring, but the substituents (CH3, Cl, OCH3) are on the ring carbons. The protons on the ring are on the other carbons.\n\nWait, the substituents are on the ring carbons. So the aromatic protons are on the ring carbons that don't have the substituents. So in this case, the substituents are on positions 1, 3, and 4. The remaining ring positions (2, 5, 6) have aromatic protons.\n\nLet me consider each:\n\n- Position 2: adjacent to position 1 (CH3) and position 3 (Cl). The proton here is between a methyl and a Cl. The neighboring aromatic protons would be on positions 1 and 3? No, the neighboring protons are on the adjacent carbons. Wait, position 2's adjacent carbons are position 1 and position 3. But position 1 has a CH3 substituent, so the proton on position 1 is not aromatic (since it's a methyl group attached to the ring). Similarly, position 3 has a Cl substituent, so the proton on position 3 is replaced by Cl. Therefore, the proton at position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (which has a CH3) and position 3 (which has Cl). Therefore, the proton at position 2 is only adjacent to position 1 and 3, but those positions don't have aromatic protons. Wait, no, the aromatic protons are on the ring, but the substituents are on the ring carbons. So the protons on the ring are on the carbons that don't have substituents.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. Each carbon in the ring can have a substituent or a proton. For example, if a carbon has a methyl group, then it doesn't have a proton. So in this case, positions 1, 3, and 4 have substituents (CH3, Cl, OCH3), so the protons are on the remaining positions (2, 5, 6).\n\nSo the aromatic protons are on positions 2, 5, and 6. Let's analyze each:\n\n- Position 2: adjacent to position 1 (CH3) and position 3 (Cl). The neighboring aromatic protons would be on position 2's adjacent carbons. Wait, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 and 3. Position 1 has a CH3 substituent (so no aromatic proton there), and position 3 has Cl (so no aromatic proton there either). Therefore, the proton on position 2 is adjacent to two substituents (CH3 and Cl) and has no neighboring aromatic protons. Therefore, its signal would be a singlet.\n\n- Position 5: adjacent to position 4 (OCH3) and position 6. Position 4 has OCH3 (so no aromatic proton there), and position 6 has a proton. Therefore, the proton on position 5 is adjacent to position 6. So if position 6 has a proton, then the proton on position 5 is adjacent to position 6's proton. Therefore, the splitting would depend on the coupling between these two.\n\n- Position 6: adjacent to position 5 and position 1 (CH3). Position 1 has a CH3 (no aromatic proton), so position 6 is adjacent to position 5. Therefore, the proton on position 6 is adjacent to position 5's proton. So if positions 5 and 6 are adjacent, their protons would split each other.\n\nSo, if positions 5 and 6 are adjacent and each has a proton, then the proton on position 5 would be split by the proton on position 6, and vice versa. If there's only one proton on position 6 and one on position 5, each would split into a doublet. So positions 5 and 6 would give doublets.\n\nTherefore, in option B's structure, the aromatic protons would be:\n\n- Position 2: singlet (1H)\n- Position 5: doublet (1H)\n- Position 6: doublet (1H)\n\nWhich matches the NMR data: 7.1 (s), 7.0 (d), 6.7 (d). That seems to fit.\n\nNow, let's check the aliphatic protons. The NMR shows 3.7 ppm (3H, s) and 2.3 ppm (3H, s). \n\nThe 3.7 ppm is likely a methoxy group (OCH3), which is common for methoxy protons. The 2.3 ppm is a methyl group (CH3). In option B, the substituents are:\n\n- Toluene's methyl (CH3 at position 1)\n- Methoxy (OCH3 at position 4)\n- Chloro (Cl at position 3)\n\nSo the methyl group (CH3) is on the ring. The chemical shift for aromatic methyl groups (like in toluene) is typically around 2.3 ppm, which matches the 2.3 ppm signal. The methoxy group (OCH3) would have protons around 3.7-3.8 ppm, which matches the 3.7 ppm signal. \n\nTherefore, option B (3-Chloro-4-methoxytoluene) seems to fit the NMR data.\n\nLet me cross-check with other options to be sure.\n\nOption A: 5-Chloro-1,3-xylene. Xylene is dimethylbenzene. 1,3-xylene has methyl groups on positions 1 and 3. Adding a chloro on position 5. The structure would have substituents at 1 (CH3), 3 (CH3), and 5 (Cl). The aromatic protons would be on positions 2, 4, 6. Let's see the splitting.\n\nPosition 2: adjacent to CH3 (1) and CH3 (3). The proton here might be a singlet if symmetric. Position 4: adjacent to Cl (5) and CH3 (3). Position 6: adjacent to Cl (5) and CH3 (1). Depending on symmetry, maybe positions 2, 4, and 6 have different splitting. But with two methyl groups and a chloro, the aromatic protons might show different patterns. However, the NMR data here shows three aromatic protons (1H each) with one singlet and two doublets, which might not match. Also, the aliphatic protons would be two methyl groups (each 3H). But the NMR data has only one methyl signal (2.3 ppm, 3H) and a methoxy (3.7 ppm). So option A doesn't have a methoxy group, so it's not matching the aliphatic protons. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\nOption C: 2-Chloro-1,4-xylene. This is para-xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene) with a chloro on position 2. The substituents are 1 (CH3), 4 (CH3), and 2 (Cl). The aromatic protons would be on positions 3, 5, 6. Let's see the splitting. Position 3: adjacent to Cl (2) and CH3 (4). Position 5: adjacent to CH3 (1) and CH3 (4). Position 6: adjacent to CH3 (1) and Cl (2). Depending on the symmetry, some protons might be equivalent. However, the NMR data has three aromatic protons with one singlet and two doublets. The aliphatic protons would be two methyl groups (each 3H), but the NMR data has a methoxy (3.7 ppm) and a methyl (2.3 ppm). So option C doesn't have a methoxy group, so it's not matching. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: 3-Chloro-4-methoxyphenol. This has substituents Cl, OCH3, and OH. The NMR data doesn't show an OH proton, which is a problem. Also, the aliphatic protons would include OH and OCH3. But the given data has two singlets: 3.7 (OCH3) and 2.3 (CH3). However, phenol's OH is usually a broad signal, which isn't present here. So D is likely incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 3-Chloro-4-methoxytoluene.\n</think>"}
