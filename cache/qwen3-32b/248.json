For a triangle with vertices $ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3) $, the area is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n$$\n\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n\n- $ x_1 = 0, y_1 = 0 $\n- $ x_2 = 2, y_2 = 3 $\n- $ x_3 = 10, y_3 = 0 $\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(3 - 0) + 2(0 - 0) + 10(0 - 3) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 0 - 30 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 30 = 15\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Geometric Interpretation\n\nWe can also interpret the triangle geometrically. The base of the triangle lies along the bottom edge of the rectangle from (0,0) to (10,0), making the base length 10 cm. The height is the vertical distance from this base to the highest point of the triangle, which is at (2,3), so the height is 3 cm.\n\nUsing the standard triangle area formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 3 = 15\n$$\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: General Insight\n\nAn interesting geometric insight is that **any triangle with a base along the bottom edge of a rectangle and a third vertex on the top edge will have the same area**, as long as the base and height remain constant. In this case, the base is 10 cm and the height is 3 cm, so the area remains 15 cm² regardless of where the top vertex is placed along the top edge.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{15}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the area of the shaded triangle in the given diagram. Let me try to visualize it based on the Asymptote code provided. The Asymptote code draws a rectangle with length 10 cm on the bottom and top, and height 3 cm on the sides. Then there's a gray triangle connecting the points (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). \n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated in a couple of ways. The most common formula is (base × height)/2. But sometimes, especially when coordinates are involved, you can use the shoelace formula or determine the base and height from the coordinates. Let me see which method applies here.\n\nLooking at the coordinates given for the triangle: (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). If I can figure out the base and the height of this triangle, I can apply the standard area formula. Let me sketch this mentally. The triangle has vertices at the origin (0,0), a point (2,3) which is somewhere inside the rectangle, and another vertex at (10,0), which is the opposite end of the base.\n\nSo, if I consider the base of the triangle to be from (0,0) to (10,0), that would be a horizontal line along the bottom of the rectangle, which is 10 cm long. That seems like a good candidate for the base. The length of the base is 10 cm. Now, I need the corresponding height. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. In this case, the opposite vertex is at (2,3). Since the base is horizontal, the vertical distance from this point to the base would be its y-coordinate. Wait, the y-coordinate is 3 cm. But hold on, the rectangle's height is also 3 cm, which matches the labels in the diagram. But if the height of the triangle is 3 cm and the base is 10 cm, then the area would be (10 × 3)/2 = 15 cm². But that seems too straightforward, and maybe I'm missing something here. Because the triangle isn't the entire upper half of the rectangle; it's a specific triangle with a vertex at (2,3). So maybe my assumption about the height is incorrect?\n\nWait, let me think again. If the base is from (0,0) to (10,0), which is 10 cm, then the height is not necessarily the y-coordinate of (2,3) unless that point is directly above the base. However, in reality, the height must be the perpendicular distance from the line (which is the base) to the opposite vertex. Since the base is horizontal, the perpendicular distance is indeed the vertical distance. Therefore, the height should be 3 cm. But if that's the case, then the area is 15 cm². However, intuitively, since the triangle is not spanning the entire upper part of the rectangle but is instead a slanted line from (0,0) to (2,3) and then to (10,0), maybe the area is different? Maybe I need to check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to compute the area. The coordinates of the triangle are (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). The shoelace formula is a method to find the area of a polygon when the coordinates of the vertices are known. Let me recall the formula. For a triangle with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), the area is |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|.\n\nLet me apply that. Let me label the points: A(0,0), B(2,3), C(10,0). Plugging into the formula:\n\nArea = |(0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3))/2|\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 0*(3 - 0) = 0*3 = 0\n\nSecond term: 2*(0 - 0) = 2*0 = 0\n\nThird term: 10*(0 - 3) = 10*(-3) = -30\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 0 - 30 = -30\n\nTake absolute value and divide by 2: |-30| / 2 = 30/2 = 15 cm². \n\nSo according to the shoelace formula, the area is 15 cm². But let me verify once more because sometimes when I apply formulas, I might mix up the order of points or make a calculation error. Let me check again:\n\nFormula: |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|\n\nPlugging in:\n\nx1 = 0, y1 = 0\n\nx2 = 2, y2 = 3\n\nx3 = 10, y3 = 0\n\nSo:\n\n0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 10*(-3) = -30. Absolute value divided by 2 is 15. Correct. So the area is 15 cm². \n\nBut let me think again why I had a doubt. Maybe because if you look at the diagram, there is a rectangle with length 10 cm and height 3 cm. The triangle is drawn from one corner (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). If the entire rectangle area is 10*3=30 cm², then if the triangle was half of that, it would be 15 cm². However, if the triangle was, say, from (0,0) to (0,3) to (10,0), that would also be 15 cm². But in this case, the triangle is different. However, according to coordinates and shoelace formula, it's still 15 cm². Maybe because the average base and height still result in the same area?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the vector cross product method. The area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC. Let me try that.\n\nVector AB is from A(0,0) to B(2,3): (2 - 0, 3 - 0) = (2, 3)\n\nVector AC is from A(0,0) to C(10,0): (10 - 0, 0 - 0) = (10, 0)\n\nCross product AB × AC is (2)(0) - (3)(10) = 0 - 30 = -30. The magnitude is 30, half is 15. Same result. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates, I can divide the figure or use coordinate geometry. For instance, maybe find equations of the lines and integrate or something, but that seems overkill. Alternatively, maybe subtract areas?\n\nBut since all methods so far give 15 cm², maybe that is the correct answer. But let me check once more with another approach. For example, using coordinates, maybe divide the figure into known shapes.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle has coordinates (0,0), (2,3), (10,0), maybe we can find the base along the x-axis from 0 to 10, which is 10 cm. Then, the third point is (2,3). If I imagine dropping a vertical line from (2,3) to the base, which would be the point (2,0). Then, maybe splitting the triangle into two parts? Wait, but the triangle is already defined. However, if I think of the triangle as a combination of other shapes?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates. Wait, I already did shoelace and cross product.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: The area can be calculated by subtracting areas of other triangles from the rectangle. The rectangle has area 10*3=30. If I can figure out the areas of the unshaded regions and subtract them from 30, maybe I can get the shaded area.\n\nLooking at the diagram, the shaded triangle is in the lower part of the rectangle, with vertices at (0,0), (2,3), (10,0). The rectangle also has other regions. Let me try to visualize. If I draw the rectangle from (0,0) to (10,0) to (10,3) to (0,3). The triangle is inside this rectangle. The lines drawn are from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). So the shaded area is that triangle. The rest of the rectangle is unshaded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other triangles whose areas I can subtract. For example, there might be a triangle on top of the shaded triangle and some other regions. Let me try.\n\nFirst, the rectangle's area is 10*3=30. The shaded triangle is one region. Let me see if I can find the areas of the other regions.\n\nLooking at the rectangle, the triangle divides it into several parts. Let me think. There is the shaded triangle, and then there is a quadrilateral or another triangle on top? Maybe if I consider the line from (0,0) to (2,3). This line would create a triangle with the top of the rectangle? Or maybe not. Let me try to find equations of the lines.\n\nThe line from (0,0) to (2,3): The slope is (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2. So the equation is y = (3/2)x.\n\nThe line from (2,3) to (10,0): Let's compute its slope. (0 - 3)/(10 - 2) = (-3)/8. So slope is -3/8. The equation can be written using point-slope form. Let me use point (2,3):\n\ny - 3 = (-3/8)(x - 2)\n\nSo y = (-3/8)x + (3/4) + 3 = (-3/8)x + (15/4). Let me check with point (10,0):\n\nPlug x=10: y = (-3/8)(10) + 15/4 = -30/8 + 15/4 = -15/4 + 15/4 = 0. Correct.\n\nSo the two lines dividing the rectangle are y = (3/2)x and y = (-3/8)x + 15/4.\n\nNow, if I want to find areas of other regions, maybe I can find where these lines intersect the top of the rectangle (y=3) or other boundaries?\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since I already have two methods giving me 15 cm² for the shaded triangle, and the rectangle is 30 cm², maybe there's another triangle with area 15 cm²? If the shaded triangle is 15, then the remaining area is 15. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another triangle. For instance, the triangle formed by (2,3), (10,3), and (10,0). Wait, that triangle would have base along x=10 from (10,0) to (10,3), which is 3 cm, and base along y=3 from (2,3) to (10,3), which is 8 cm. Wait, if I consider that right triangle, its area would be (8*3)/2 = 12 cm². Then if I add that to something else... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area above the shaded triangle? Let me think. The shaded triangle is from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). The area above it would be the rest of the rectangle. If I can compute that, then subtract from 30 to get the shaded area. However, computing the area above might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry, the area can be calculated by integrating the difference between the two lines. But that's calculus, which is probably not needed here.\n\nWait, but since I have two different methods giving me 15 cm², and the rectangle's area is 30 cm², then if the shaded triangle is half of the rectangle, that would make sense. However, is the triangle really half of the rectangle? Let me think of a simple case. If you have a rectangle and draw a diagonal, that splits it into two equal triangles, each with area half of the rectangle. In this case, instead of a diagonal, we have a different line from (0,0) to (2,3) and then to (10,0). However, according to the calculations, the area is still half. Is there a reason for that?\n\nLet me check with vectors. The area of the triangle is 15, which is half of 30. Is there a general principle here? For example, if you have a triangle with one side being the base of the rectangle and the third vertex touching the top side somewhere, does it always have half the area? No, that's not true. For example, if the third vertex is very close to the corner, the area would be small. For instance, if the third vertex was (0,3), then the triangle would have area (10*0)/2? No, wait. If the triangle is from (0,0), (0,3), (10,0), then the area is |(0*(3-0) + 0*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3))/2| = |0 + 0 -30| /2 = 15. Same area. Wait, so even though the point is at the corner, the area is still 15. If the third vertex is somewhere along the top edge, does the area remain the same? Wait, let me take another example. Suppose the third vertex is at (5,3). Then the triangle would be from (0,0), (5,3), (10,0). Let me calculate its area with shoelace:\n\nCoordinates: (0,0), (5,3), (10,0).\n\nArea = |0*(3 - 0) + 5*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3)| / 2 = |0 + 0 -30| /2 = 15 cm². Same result! So regardless of where the third vertex is along the top edge, the area of the triangle is always 15 cm²? That seems counter-intuitive. Wait, but if you have a base on the bottom of the rectangle and the third vertex somewhere on the top, the area is always half of the rectangle? But the rectangle's area is 30, so half is 15. So yes! Because the area of such a triangle is (base × height)/2 = (10 × 3)/2 = 15. So regardless of where the third vertex is on the top edge, the area remains the same. Because the base is fixed (10 cm) and the height is fixed (3 cm). The position of the third vertex along the top doesn't change the height, as long as it's on the top edge. Therefore, even though the triangle looks different depending on where you put the third vertex on the top, its area remains the same. \n\nTherefore, in this problem, even though the triangle goes from (0,0) up to (2,3) and then down to (10,0), since the third vertex is on the top edge of the rectangle, the area is still (base × height)/2 = 15 cm². Therefore, the answer is 15 cm².\n\nBut let me verify once more with another example. Suppose the third vertex is at (1,3). Then the triangle is (0,0), (1,3), (10,0). Shoelace formula:\n\nArea = |0*(3 - 0) + 1*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3)| / 2 = |0 + 0 -30| /2 = 15. Same result. Therefore, regardless of where the top vertex is on the upper side, the area remains the same. Therefore, the answer is 15 cm².\n\nBut why does this happen? Because when you fix the base and the height, the area is determined solely by those two measurements, not by the specific position of the third vertex. As long as the height is the same (i.e., the third vertex lies on a line parallel to the base at a distance equal to the height), the area remains constant. In this case, since the base is on the bottom of the rectangle and the third vertex is on the top, which is parallel to the base and at a distance of 3 cm, the area is always (10×3)/2 = 15 cm². Therefore, even though the triangle in the problem is not symmetric or anything, its area is still 15.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the area of the shaded triangle is 15 cm².\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe area of the shaded triangle is \\boxed{15} square centimeters.\n</think>"}
