The problem also mentions that the radius is 3 centimeters. Let me recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder. I think it's V = πr²h, right? Let me check that... Yeah, volume of a cylinder is the area of the base times the height, and the base is a circle with area πr². So that formula makes sense.\n\nAlright, so if I plug in the values I know into the formula, I can solve for the height. Let me write down what I know:\n\nVolume (V) = 45π cm³  \nRadius (r) = 3 cm  \nHeight (h) = ? cm\n\nSo substituting into the formula:\n\nV = πr²h  \n45π = π*(3)²*h\n\nHmm, okay, let me simplify that. First, let me calculate 3 squared. 3 squared is 9. So:\n\n45π = π*9*h\n\nNow, I can see that π is on both sides of the equation. Maybe I can divide both sides by π to get rid of it. Let me try that:\n\n45π / π = 9h  \nWhich simplifies to 45 = 9h\n\nOkay, so now I have 45 equals 9 times h. To solve for h, I need to divide both sides by 9.\n\nh = 45 / 9  \nh = 5\n\nWait, so is the height 5 centimeters? Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the volume formula: correct. Plugging in the radius as 3: correct. Squaring 3 gives 9: right. Dividing both sides by π: yes, that cancels out the π on the right side. Then dividing 45 by 9 gives 5: correct. Seems straightforward. \n\nLet me verify by plugging the height back into the formula to see if I get the original volume. Let's calculate π*(3)^2*5. 3 squared is 9, times 5 is 45, so π*45, which is 45π. Yep, that matches the given volume. So that checks out.\n\nI guess there's not much more to it. The key was remembering the formula for the volume of a cylinder and then plugging in the known values. The Asymptote code showed a cylinder with radius labeled as 3 and height labeled as h, so that aligns with the given information. I don't see any tricks or hidden steps here. Maybe some common mistakes could be forgetting to square the radius or miscalculating 3 squared, but as long as you take it step by step, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nAnother thing to note is that sometimes problems might give diameters instead of radii, but here it clearly says r = 3, so no need to worry about converting diameter to radius. If they had given the diameter as 6, for instance, I would have had to divide by 2 first. But in this case, radius is already given as 3. \n\nAlso, units are consistent: volume is in cubic centimeters, radius in centimeters, so the height will naturally come out in centimeters. No unit conversion needed here. \n\nSo, yeah, I think that's all there is to it. The height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe height of the cylinder is \\boxed{5} centimeters.\n</think>"}
