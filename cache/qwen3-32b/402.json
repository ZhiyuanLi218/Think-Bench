In the case of oxoacids like nitric acid (HNO₃) and nitrous acid (HNO₂), the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule plays a critical role in determining acid strength.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Structural Differences\n\n- **Nitric acid (HNO₃)** has the formula HNO₃, meaning it has **three oxygen atoms**.\n- **Nitrous acid (HNO₂)** has the formula HNO₂, meaning it has **two oxygen atoms**.\n\nBoth acids share the same central atom (nitrogen) and the acidic hydrogen is always attached to an oxygen atom, not to the nitrogen. Therefore, **option D**, which claims the hydrogen is bound directly to nitrogen, is **incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### Electronegativity and Oxidation State\n\n- **Option A** claims that the nitrogen in nitric acid is more electronegative than in nitrous acid. However, **electronegativity is an atomic property**, not a molecular one, and nitrogen remains the same element in both compounds. What **does** differ is the **oxidation state** of nitrogen (e.g., +5 in HNO₃ and +3 in HNO₂), but this does not change the electronegativity of the nitrogen atom itself. So, **option A is also incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### The Role of Oxygen Atoms\n\n- **Option B** states that nitric acid has more oxygen atoms in its formula, which is **factually true**. However, it does **not explain the reason** for the increased acidity. It is a **contributing factor**, but the question asks for the **reason** nitric acid is a stronger acid. So while B is correct in a factual sense, it does not fully answer the \"why\" behind the increased acidity.\n\n- **Option C**, on the other hand, explains the **mechanism** behind the increased acidity. It correctly states that the **–O–H bonds in nitric acid are weaker than in nitrous acid due to the electron-withdrawing effect of more oxygen atoms**. The additional oxygen atoms in HNO₃ increase the **inductive effect**, pulling electron density away from the O–H bond. This weakens the bond and makes it **easier for the proton to be released**, resulting in a stronger acid.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe **correct answer** is the one that **explains the mechanism** behind the increased acidity of nitric acid. This is best captured by **option C**, which highlights the **weakening of the O–H bond due to the electron-withdrawing effect of more oxygen atoms**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out why nitric acid is stronger than nitrous acid. I remember that acids are considered strong if they dissociate completely in water. Weak acids don't dissociate as much. So nitric acid (HNO3) is a strong acid, and nitrous acid (HNO2) is weaker.\n\nThe question gives four options, so I need to evaluate each one. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about acid strength. I think the strength of an acid depends on factors like the stability of the conjugate base, the ability of the molecule to donate a proton, and the structure of the acid itself.\n\nFor oxoacids, which are acids with oxygen, there's a general trend that as the number of oxygen atoms increases, the acid strength increases. This is because more oxygen atoms can withdraw electron density from the O-H bond, making it easier to lose a proton. So if nitric acid has more oxygen atoms than nitrous acid, that might make it a stronger acid. Let me check the formulas again. Nitric acid is HNO3, and nitrous acid is HNO2. So nitric acid has one more oxygen. That would support option B. \n\nBut wait, the options mention other factors too. Option A says the nitrogen in nitric acid is more electronegative. But electronegativity is a property of the element itself, not the compound. Nitrogen is the same element in both, so its electronegativity shouldn't change. So A might be incorrect. Unless there's some oxidation state effect here. Wait, in HNO3, nitrogen is in +5 oxidation state, while in HNO2 it's +3. Does oxidation state affect electronegativity? I don't think so. Electronegativity is a fixed value for an element. So maybe A is wrong.\n\nOption C says the O-H bonds in nitric acid are weaker due to electron withdrawal by more oxygen atoms. If there are more oxygen atoms, they can withdraw electron density through induction, making the O-H bond weaker and easier to break. That would make the acid stronger because the proton is more easily released. So this seems plausible. \n\nOption D suggests that in nitric acid, hydrogen is bound directly to nitrogen. But in both HNO3 and HNO2, the acidic hydrogen is attached to an oxygen, not the nitrogen. Let me visualize the structures. Nitric acid has the structure where the hydrogen is attached to one of the oxygen atoms in the nitrate ion (NO3^-), and nitrous acid has the hydrogen attached to one oxygen in the nitrite ion (NO2^-). So the acidic hydrogen is always on the oxygen. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo between B and C. The general rule for oxoacids is that acid strength increases with the number of oxygen atoms. But the reasoning is about how the additional oxygen atoms help stabilize the conjugate base through resonance and inductive effects, which makes the O-H bond weaker. So option C is explaining that the O-H bonds are weaker in nitric acid because of the electron-withdrawing effect of more oxygen atoms. Option B is just stating that there are more oxygen atoms. Which is correct?\n\nThe question is asking why nitric acid is stronger. The correct answer is likely related to the inductive effect and resonance stabilization. So option C is explaining the mechanism (weaker O-H bonds due to electron withdrawal), while option B is a factual statement but maybe not the reason. However, sometimes in these questions, the more direct answer is the one about the number of oxygen atoms. Wait, the standard explanation is that more oxygen atoms increase acid strength. For example, comparing HClO4, HClO3, HClO2, and HClO, the strength decreases as the number of oxygen decreases. So the number of oxygen atoms is a key factor. So maybe option B is the answer. But the question is why? The reason is because more oxygen atoms withdraw electrons, making the O-H bond weaker. So both B and C are related. But the options are separate. The question is asking for the reason. So if the answer is B, then the reason is more oxygen atoms. If the answer is C, it's about the effect of those oxygen atoms.\n\nIn the options, C says that the O-H bonds are weaker in nitric acid due to electron withdrawal by more oxygen atoms. That's the actual reason. B is just stating the number of oxygen atoms. In a test question, sometimes the correct answer is the one that explains the mechanism. For example, the standard explanation is that more oxygen atoms increase the acidity by stabilizing the conjugate base through resonance and inductive effects, which makes the O-H bond weaker. So C is the correct answer. But sometimes, the question might take B as correct. Let me check some references.\n\nIn general chemistry textbooks, the rule is that for oxoacids of the same element, the acid strength increases with the number of oxygen atoms. The reasoning is that more oxygen atoms increase the electron-withdrawing effect, stabilizing the conjugate base. So the direct reason is the electron withdrawal leading to weaker O-H bonds, which is option C. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. Option B is a true statement but doesn't explain the reason; it's a contributing factor but not the direct cause. However, sometimes in multiple-choice questions, the answer is the one that mentions the number of oxygen atoms. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is phrased as \"because...\" So it's asking for the reason. The reason is that the O-H bonds are weaker in nitric acid due to more oxygen atoms withdrawing electrons. So the answer is C. Option B is a fact but not the reason. So the correct answer is C. Option A is incorrect because electronegativity of nitrogen doesn't change. Option D is incorrect because the hydrogen is on oxygen, not nitrogen. So the answer is C.\n</think>"}
