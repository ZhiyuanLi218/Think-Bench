The cube roots of unity are:\n\n$$\n1, \\quad \\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}, \\quad \\omega^2 = e^{4\\pi i/3}\n$$\n\nThese satisfy the identity:\n\n$$\n1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\n$$\n\nThis identity is key and will be used in simplifying the expression.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Algebraic Simplification\n\nWe start by combining the two terms of the expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n$$\n\nTo combine these, we find a common denominator:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n= \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n$$\n\nNow compute the denominator:\n\n$$\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3\n$$\n\nSince $\\omega^3 = 1$, we have:\n\n$$\n1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n$$\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2} = 1\n$$\n\nThis simplification holds as long as the denominator is not zero.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if $\\omega^3 = 1$, then $\\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are 1, and the other two are complex numbers. Specifically, they are $1$, $e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{4\\pi i/3}$. These can also be written using radicals. Let me recall that the non-real cube roots of unity satisfy $\\omega = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\\omega^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$, right?\n\nBut before I jump into plugging in values, maybe there's a smarter algebraic way to simplify the expression. Let me try that first.\n\nGiven that $\\omega^3 = 1$, I know that $\\omega \\neq 1$ if we are talking about the non-trivial roots. Wait, but the problem says \"a complex number such that $\\omega^3 = 1$\", so $\\omega$ could be 1 or one of the other roots. However, if $\\omega = 1$, then the expression becomes $\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$. But I need to check if $\\omega = 1$ is allowed here. Let me see. The problem says \"a complex number such that $\\omega^3 = 1$\", so 1 is allowed. However, sometimes in problems involving roots of unity, they refer to primitive roots, but the problem doesn't specify that. So maybe we need to consider all cube roots of unity, including 1. However, if $\\omega = 1$, then the denominators become 1 + 1 = 2, which is fine. So maybe 1 is a possible value. But then again, maybe there are other values when $\\omega$ is not 1. Let me check.\n\nBut let me first consider $\\omega$ as a primitive cube root of unity, so $\\omega \\neq 1$. In that case, we can use the fact that $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$. That's a key identity for roots of unity. Since $\\omega^3 - 1 = 0$, which factors as $(\\omega - 1)(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1) = 0$. So if $\\omega \\neq 1$, then $\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0$. Therefore, $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$, so $1 + \\omega = -\\omega^2$ and $1 + \\omega^2 = -\\omega$. Let me verify that:\n\nIf $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$, then rearranging gives $1 + \\omega = -\\omega^2$ and $1 + \\omega^2 = -\\omega$. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, substituting into the original expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{-\\omega^2} + \\frac{1}{-\\omega} = -\\frac{1}{\\omega^2} - \\frac{1}{\\omega}\n$$\n\nBut since $\\omega^3 = 1$, then $\\omega^2 = \\omega^{-1}$ and $\\omega = \\omega^{-2}$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{\\omega^2} = \\omega$ and $\\frac{1}{\\omega} = \\omega^2$. Therefore, substituting back:\n\n$$\n- \\omega - \\omega^2 = -(\\omega + \\omega^2)\n$$\n\nBut from the identity $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$, we know that $\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1$. Therefore:\n\n$$\n-(-1) = 1\n$$\n\nWait, so even when $\\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity, the expression simplifies to 1? But earlier, when we plugged in $\\omega = 1$, we also got 1. So does that mean that regardless of which cube root of unity we take, the expression is always 1? That seems surprising. Let me check with actual numbers.\n\nLet me take $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$. Then $\\omega^2 = e^{4\\pi i /3} = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$.\n\nLet me compute $1 + \\omega = 1 + (-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$. Similarly, $1 + \\omega^2 = 1 + (-\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i}\n$$\n\nTo compute this, let me rationalize the denominators. For the first term, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i} \\times \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i}{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the second term:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i} \\times \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\n$$\n\nAdding them together:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i) = 1 + 0 = 1\n$$\n\nSo indeed, even with the non-real cube roots, the expression evaluates to 1. And when $\\omega = 1$, as I checked earlier, it's also 1. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity we choose, the value of the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Find all possible values\". But according to this, there's only one value. However, maybe I made a mistake here? Let me check again.\n\nFirst, cube roots of unity are 1, $\\omega$, and $\\omega^2$. For each of these, we plug into the expression:\n\nCase 1: $\\omega = 1$. Then expression is $\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\n\nCase 2: $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3}$. As above, gives 1.\n\nCase 3: $\\omega = e^{4\\pi i /3}$. Let me check this one as well. Let me compute the expression with $\\omega = \\omega^2$ (since the third root is $\\omega^2$ when $\\omega$ is the primitive root). Wait, if $\\omega$ is $e^{4\\pi i /3}$, then $\\omega^2 = e^{8\\pi i /3} = e^{2\\pi i /3}$, which is the other primitive root. So the expression would be:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{4\\pi i /3}} + \\frac{1}{1 + e^{2\\pi i /3}}\n$$\n\nBut this is the same as the previous case, just swapping $\\omega$ and $\\omega^2$, so adding the same two terms in reverse order, so the sum is still 1. Therefore, all three cases give 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut maybe there's something wrong here? Let me try another approach. Let me compute the expression algebraically without assuming $\\omega \\neq 1$.\n\nLet me consider $\\omega^3 = 1$, so $\\omega^3 - 1 = 0$. Let me compute the given expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n$$\n\nLet me combine the fractions:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator, which is $(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)$. Let me compute numerator:\n\n$$\n(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) = 1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n$$\n\nTherefore, the combined fraction is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n$$\n\nNow, let me compute the denominator:\n\n$$\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2 = 1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + \\omega^3\n$$\n\nBut $\\omega^3 = 1$, so substitute:\n\n$$\n1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n$$\n\nTherefore, the denominator is the same as the numerator. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2} = 1\n$$\n\nBut wait, this seems to hold as long as the denominator is not zero. Therefore, as long as $2 + \\omega + \\omega^2 \\neq 0$. But let me check if $2 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$ is possible. Since we know that $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$, then $2 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 1 + (1 + \\omega + \\omega^2) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the denominator is always 1, so the expression is always 1, regardless of $\\omega$ (as long as denominators in the original expression are defined). Therefore, the expression simplifies to 1 for all $\\omega$ such that $\\omega^3 = 1$ and $1 + \\omega \\neq 0$ and $1 + \\omega^2 \\neq 0$.\n\nBut wait, could there be a case where $1 + \\omega = 0$ or $1 + \\omega^2 = 0$? Let me check.\n\nIf $1 + \\omega = 0$, then $\\omega = -1$. But is -1 a cube root of unity? Let me check: $(-1)^3 = -1 \\neq 1$. Therefore, -1 is not a cube root of unity, so $1 + \\omega$ cannot be zero for $\\omega$ a cube root of unity. Similarly, $1 + \\omega^2 = 0$ would imply $\\omega^2 = -1$, so $\\omega^3 = \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega \\cdot (-1) = -\\omega = 1$, so $\\omega = -1$. Again, which is not a cube root of unity. Therefore, denominators are never zero, so the expression is always defined and equals 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"Find all possible values\". Maybe there is something I'm missing here? Let me check once again.\n\nSuppose $\\omega$ is any cube root of unity. Then regardless of which one, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here? Let me think again. Suppose someone might think that when $\\omega = 1$, the original expression is 1, but when $\\omega$ is a primitive root, maybe there's another value? But according to both algebraic manipulation and plugging in numbers, it's always 1. Therefore, maybe there's only one value. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in combining the fractions? Let me check again:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3)} = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + 1)} = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2} = 1\n$$\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, regardless of $\\omega$, as long as it's a cube root of unity, the expression equals 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me check with $\\omega = 1$ in this algebra. If $\\omega = 1$, then denominator is (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2*2 = 4. Numerator is 1*(1 + 1) + 1*(1 + 1)? Wait no, when combining fractions, numerator is (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω). If ω = 1, then numerator is (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 2 + 2 = 4. Denominator is (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4. So 4/4 = 1. Correct. So yes, even when ω = 1, the algebra works out. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity we take, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>"}
