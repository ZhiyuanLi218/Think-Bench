At first glance, one might expect the energy of the emitted gamma ray $ E_\\gamma $ to be exactly equal to the excitation energy $ \\Delta E $ of the nucleus. However, this is not the case. The reason lies in the conservation of momentum and the recoil of the nucleus.\n\n---\n\n### Conservation of Momentum and Energy\n\nInitially, the nucleus is at rest, so its total momentum is zero. After the gamma ray is emitted, the nucleus must recoil in the opposite direction to conserve momentum. This implies:\n\n$$\np_\\gamma = -p_n\n$$\n\nwhere $ p_\\gamma $ is the momentum of the gamma ray and $ p_n $ is the momentum of the nucleus. For a photon, the momentum is related to its energy by $ p_\\gamma = \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} $, and the kinetic energy of the nucleus is:\n\n$$\nK_n = \\frac{p_n^2}{2M} = \\frac{E_\\gamma^2}{2Mc^2}\n$$\n\nThe total energy released in the de-excitation process, $ \\Delta E $, is the sum of the energy of the photon and the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus:\n\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_\\gamma + K_n = E_\\gamma + \\frac{E_\\gamma^2}{2Mc^2}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Approximation under $ \\Delta E \\ll Mc^2 $\n\nGiven the condition $ \\Delta E \\ll Mc^2 $, we can assume that $ E_\\gamma \\approx \\Delta E $, and the kinetic energy of the nucleus is small compared to $ \\Delta E $.

The question is asking why the energy of the gamma ray emitted when it de-excites isn't equal to the excitation energy ΔE. Then, under the assumption that ΔE is much smaller than Mc², I need to find the relative change (ΔE - Eγ)/ΔE. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a nucleus emits a gamma ray, it's transitioning from a higher energy state to a lower one. Normally, I would expect that the energy of the photon emitted is exactly equal to the difference in energy between the two states, right? Like, in atomic transitions, the photon energy is equal to the energy difference. But here, the problem states that Eγ isn't equal to ΔE. So why is that?\n\nMaybe it has to do with conservation laws? Like conservation of momentum or something? Because the nucleus isn't infinitely heavy, so when it emits a photon, it has to recoil. So the photon can't take all the energy because the nucleus also has to have some kinetic energy from recoiling. That must be it! In atomic transitions, the atom is so much heavier than the electron, so the recoil is negligible. But for a nucleus emitting a photon, even though the nucleus is heavy, the photon still carries away some momentum, so the nucleus has to recoil to conserve momentum. Therefore, the energy of the photon is less than the excitation energy because some energy goes into the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus.\n\nOkay, so let me try to model this. Let me consider the nucleus initially at rest. When it emits a gamma photon, the nucleus recoils in the opposite direction. So the total momentum before emission is zero, so after emission, the momentum of the photon plus the momentum of the nucleus must also be zero. Therefore, the magnitude of the photon's momentum must equal the magnitude of the nucleus's momentum.\n\nLet me write that down. Let’s denote the photon's momentum as p_γ and the nucleus's momentum as p_n. Then:\n\np_γ = -p_n (vectorially, but magnitudes are equal)\n\nThe energy of the photon is E_γ = p_γ c, since photons have energy E = pc.\n\nThe nucleus, after recoil, will have kinetic energy. Let's denote that as K_n. The total energy released, ΔE, should be equal to the energy of the photon plus the kinetic energy of the nucleus:\n\nΔE = E_γ + K_n\n\nTherefore, E_γ = ΔE - K_n. Hence, the difference between ΔE and E_γ is just the kinetic energy of the nucleus. Therefore, the relative change (ΔE - E_γ)/ΔE is equal to K_n / ΔE.\n\nSo the question reduces to finding K_n / ΔE. Now, I need to express K_n in terms of ΔE. But how?\n\nSince we know that the momentum of the photon is equal to the momentum of the nucleus:\n\np_γ = p_n\n\nBut p_γ = E_γ / c, so:\n\np_n = E_γ / c\n\nThe kinetic energy of the nucleus can be expressed in terms of its momentum. For non-relativistic speeds (which should be a valid assumption here because ΔE << Mc², implying that the kinetic energy K_n is much smaller than Mc², so the nucleus is moving non-relativistically), the kinetic energy is:\n\nK_n = p_n² / (2M)\n\nSubstituting p_n = E_γ / c:\n\nK_n = (E_γ²) / (2 M c²)\n\nSo now, we have ΔE = E_γ + K_n = E_γ + E_γ²/(2 M c²)\n\nBut the problem says ΔE ≪ M c². So E_γ is approximately ΔE, but slightly less. However, since ΔE ≪ M c², then E_γ²/(2 M c²) is going to be much smaller than ΔE? Wait, but if E_γ ≈ ΔE, then K_n ≈ ΔE²/(2 M c²). Therefore, since ΔE << M c², ΔE²/(2 M c²) is much smaller than ΔE. Therefore, the difference between ΔE and E_γ is small. Therefore, the relative change is K_n / ΔE ≈ [ΔE²/(2 M c²)] / ΔE = ΔE/(2 M c²). Therefore, the relative change is approximately ΔE/(2 M c²).\n\nBut let me check this again. Let me go back.\n\nStarting from ΔE = E_γ + K_n, and K_n = E_γ²/(2 M c²). Therefore:\n\nΔE = E_γ + E_γ²/(2 M c²)\n\nBut if ΔE ≪ M c², then E_γ is approximately ΔE, but let's solve for E_γ. Let me rearrange:\n\nE_γ²/(2 M c²) + E_γ - ΔE = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in E_γ:\n\nE_γ²/(2 M c²) + E_γ - ΔE = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 M c²:\n\nE_γ² + 2 M c² E_γ - 2 M c² ΔE = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nE_γ = [-2 M c² ± sqrt( (2 M c²)^2 + 8 M c² ΔE )]/2\n\nBut since energy can't be negative, take the positive root:\n\nE_γ = [ -2 M c² + sqrt(4 M² c^4 + 8 M c² ΔE) ] / 2\n\nWait, that seems messy. Let me factor out 4 M² c^4 inside the square root:\n\nsqrt(4 M² c^4 + 8 M c² ΔE) = sqrt(4 M² c^4 [1 + (8 M c² ΔE)/(4 M² c^4)]) = sqrt(4 M² c^4 [1 + 2 ΔE/(M c²)]) ) = 2 M c² sqrt(1 + 2 ΔE/(M c²))\n\nTherefore:\n\nE_γ = [ -2 M c² + 2 M c² sqrt(1 + 2 ΔE/(M c²)) ] / 2 = M c² [ -1 + sqrt(1 + 2 ΔE/(M c²)) ]\n\nNow, since ΔE << M c², we can expand the square root in a Taylor series. Let me write x = 2 ΔE/(M c²), which is small. Then sqrt(1 + x) ≈ 1 + x/2 - x²/8 + ... So:\n\nsqrt(1 + x) ≈ 1 + x/2 - x²/8\n\nTherefore:\n\nE_γ ≈ M c² [ -1 + 1 + x/2 - x²/8 ] = M c² [ x/2 - x²/8 ]\n\nSubstituting back x = 2 ΔE/(M c²):\n\nE_γ ≈ M c² [ (2 ΔE/(M c²))/2 - ( (2 ΔE/(M c²))² ) / 8 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: (2 ΔE/(M c²))/2 = ΔE/(M c²)\n\nMultiply by M c²: ΔE\n\nSecond term: ( (4 ΔE²)/(M² c^4) ) / 8 = ΔE²/(2 M² c^4)\n\nMultiply by M c²: ΔE²/(2 M c²)\n\nTherefore:\n\nE_γ ≈ ΔE - ΔE²/(2 M c²)\n\nTherefore, ΔE - E_γ ≈ ΔE²/(2 M c²)\n\nTherefore, the relative change is:\n\n(ΔE - E_γ)/ΔE ≈ [ΔE²/(2 M c²)] / ΔE = ΔE/(2 M c²)\n\nSo the relative change is ΔE/(2 M c²). Therefore, under the assumption ΔE << M c², the relative difference between ΔE and E_γ is approximately ΔE/(2 M c²).\n\nBut let me check if there is another way to get here without solving the quadratic. Earlier, I thought that since K_n = E_γ²/(2 M c²), and ΔE = E_γ + K_n, then if we assume that K_n is small compared to ΔE, we can approximate E_γ ≈ ΔE - K_n ≈ ΔE. Therefore, substituting back into K_n:\n\nK_n ≈ (ΔE)^2/(2 M c²)\n\nTherefore, (ΔE - E_γ)/ΔE ≈ K_n / ΔE ≈ ΔE/(2 M c²). So same result. Therefore, this seems consistent.\n\nSo the answer is ΔE/(2 M c²). Therefore, the relative change is ΔE divided by twice the product of M and c squared. Since the question says ΔE << M c², this fraction is indeed small, which makes sense why E_γ is not exactly equal to ΔE, but very close.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be ΔE/(2 M c²). But let me check units to make sure. ΔE has units of energy, M c² also has units of energy (since M is mass, c² is velocity squared, so M c² is energy). Therefore, the ratio is dimensionless, which is good because it's a relative change.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in these recoil problems, there's a factor of 1/2 or something. Let me think again. For example, in the case of a photon emitted by an atom, the recoil kinetic energy is p²/(2M), and p = E_photon / c. So K = E_photon²/(2 M c²). Then, if the energy levels difference is ΔE, then ΔE = E_photon + K. So solving for E_photon gives ΔE - K. If ΔE is small compared to M c², then K is small, so E_photon ≈ ΔE. Therefore, K ≈ (ΔE)^2/(2 M c²), so the difference between ΔE and E_photon is (ΔE)^2/(2 M c²), so relative difference is ΔE/(2 M c²). Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ΔE/(2 M c²). Therefore, written as a formula, the relative change is ΔE divided by (2 M c²). So boxed, it would be \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\Delta E}{2 M c^2}}.\n\nBut let me check if there's a standard formula for this. For example, in the case of gamma decay, the recoil energy of the nucleus is given by E_recoil = E_gamma²/(2 M c²). And since ΔE = E_gamma + E_recoil, then:\n\nE_gamma = ΔE - E_recoil ≈ ΔE - (ΔE)^2/(2 M c²)\n\nTherefore, ΔE - E_gamma ≈ (ΔE)^2/(2 M c²)\n\nTherefore, (ΔE - E_gamma)/ΔE ≈ ΔE/(2 M c²). Yep, same thing. Therefore, this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ΔE/(2 M c²). So the relative change is of the order ΔE/(2 M c²), which is very small because ΔE << M c². Hence, E_gamma is slightly less than ΔE by this fraction.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe relative change is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\Delta E}{2 M c^2}}.\n</think>"}
