Let me recall what I know about this system. \n\nFirst, the potential is V(x) = -α δ(x), which is an attractive delta function potential in one dimension. Since α is positive, the potential is indeed attractive. For such a potential, I remember that there is exactly one bound state, regardless of how weak the potential is. That's different from the 3D case, where you need a certain strength for a bound state to exist. \n\nSo, the wavefunction for the bound state... I think it's an exponentially decaying function on either side of the delta function. Let me try to recall the exact form. \n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for this system is:\n\n- (ℏ²/2m) ψ''(x) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nSince the potential is zero except at x=0, the general solution away from x=0 should be similar to the free particle, but with exponential decay because it's a bound state (so E < 0). Let me denote k = sqrt(-2mE)/ℏ, so that the solutions are exponentially decaying. \n\nSince the potential is symmetric (even though it's a delta function at the origin), the wavefunction should be symmetric or antisymmetric. But since the potential is only at the origin, and the bound state is unique, I think it must be symmetric. So the wavefunction should be even, meaning ψ(x) = ψ(-x). Therefore, the derivative at x=0 should be zero? Wait, no. Wait, for the bound state, the wavefunction must be continuous everywhere, and its derivative must have a discontinuity at x=0 due to the delta function. \n\nLet me write down the general solution. For x ≠ 0, the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n- (ℏ²/2m) ψ''(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nWhich rearranged is:\n\nψ''(x) = - (2mE)/ℏ² ψ(x)\n\nBut since E is negative for a bound state, let me define k² = -2mE/ℏ², so that k is real and positive. Then the equation becomes:\n\nψ''(x) = k² ψ(x)\n\nSo the solutions are exponentials. For x > 0, the wavefunction should decay as x increases, so ψ(x) = A e^{-k x}, and for x < 0, since it's symmetric, ψ(x) = A e^{k x}. Therefore, the general form is:\n\nψ(x) = A e^{-k |x|}\n\nNow, I need to find k by applying the boundary conditions. The wavefunction must be continuous at x=0, which it is, since both sides give A. The derivative, however, will have a discontinuity. Let me integrate the Schrödinger equation from -ε to +ε and take ε → 0.\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\n∫[-ε to ε] [ - (ℏ²/2m) ψ''(x) + V(x)ψ(x) ] dx = ∫[-ε to ε] Eψ(x) dx\n\nAs ε → 0, the integral of Eψ(x) dx goes to zero because it's proportional to ε. The integral of V(x)ψ(x) dx is -α ψ(0), since ∫ δ(x) ψ(x) dx = ψ(0). \n\nFor the first term, integrating - (ℏ²/2m) ψ''(x) over [-ε, ε] gives - (ℏ²/2m) [ψ'(ε) - ψ'(-ε)]. Taking the limit ε → 0, this becomes - (ℏ²/2m) [ψ'(0+) - ψ'(0-)].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- (ℏ²/2m) [ψ'(0+) - ψ'(0-)] - α ψ(0) = 0\n\nLet me compute ψ'(0+). For x > 0, ψ(x) = A e^{-k x}, so derivative is -k A e^{-k x}, so at x=0+, ψ'(0+) = -k A. Similarly, for x < 0, ψ(x) = A e^{k x}, derivative is +k A e^{k x}, so ψ'(0-) = +k A. Therefore, ψ'(0+) - ψ'(0-) = -k A - k A = -2k A. \n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation:\n\n- (ℏ²/2m) (-2k A) - α A = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(ℏ²/2m)(2k A) - α A = 0 ⇒ (ℏ² k / m) A - α A = 0 ⇒ ℏ² k / m = α ⇒ k = m α / ℏ²\n\nSo k is determined as m α / ℏ². Therefore, the wavefunction is:\n\nψ(x) = A e^{- (m α / ℏ²) |x| }\n\nNow, we need to normalize this wavefunction to find A. The normalization condition is:\n\n∫_{-∞}^∞ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nSince the wavefunction is even, we can compute 2 ∫_{0}^∞ |ψ(x)|² dx:\n\n2 * A² ∫_{0}^∞ e^{-2k x} dx = 1\n\nCompute the integral:\n\n∫_{0}^∞ e^{-2k x} dx = 1/(2k)\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 * A² * 1/(2k) = A² / k = 1 ⇒ A = sqrt(k)\n\nSo A = sqrt(k) = sqrt( m α / ℏ² ). Therefore, the normalized wavefunction is:\n\nψ(x) = sqrt( m α / ℏ² ) e^{ - (m α / ℏ² ) |x| }\n\nAlternatively, let me check the calculation again. Let me denote k = mα/ℏ². Then ψ(x) = A e^{-k |x|}, normalization:\n\n∫_{-∞}^∞ A² e^{-2k |x|} dx = 2 A² ∫_{0}^∞ e^{-2k x} dx = 2 A² [1/(2k)] = A² / k = 1 ⇒ A = sqrt(k). Yes, that's correct. So ψ(x) = sqrt(k) e^{-k |x|} with k = mα/ℏ².\n\nSo now, the probability of finding the particle between -x₀ and x₀ is:\n\nP = ∫_{-x₀}^{x₀} |ψ(x)|² dx = 2 ∫_{0}^{x₀} |ψ(x)|² dx\n\nBecause the integrand is even. Let me compute that.\n\n|ψ(x)|² = k e^{-2k |x| }, since A² is k. Therefore:\n\nP = 2 ∫_{0}^{x₀} k e^{-2k x} dx \n\nLet me compute the integral:\n\n∫ k e^{-2k x} dx from 0 to x₀ is [ - (k/(2k)) e^{-2k x} ] from 0 to x₀ = [ -1/2 e^{-2k x} ] from 0 to x₀ = -1/2 e^{-2k x₀} + 1/2 e^{0} = 1/2 (1 - e^{-2k x₀})\n\nMultiply by 2 (from the P expression):\n\nP = 2 * [1/2 (1 - e^{-2k x₀})] = 1 - e^{-2k x₀}\n\nWe want this probability to be 1/2:\n\n1 - e^{-2k x₀} = 1/2 ⇒ e^{-2k x₀} = 1/2 ⇒ -2k x₀ = ln(1/2) ⇒ -2k x₀ = -ln 2 ⇒ x₀ = ln 2 / (2k)\n\nNow, substitute k = mα / ℏ²:\n\nx₀ = ln 2 / [ 2*(mα / ℏ²) ] = ( ℏ² ln 2 ) / ( 2 m α )\n\nSo x₀ is [ ℏ² / (2 m α ) ] * ln 2. \n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nA: ln(2) [ℏ²/mα²]\n\nB: ln(4) [ℏ²/mα²]\n\nC: ln(4) [ℏ²/2mα]\n\nD: ln(2) [ℏ²/2mα]\n\nMy result is [ ℏ² ln 2 / (2 m α ) ] which is option D: ln(2) [ℏ²/(2mα)].\n\nBut let me check again my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, solving for k: yes, from the boundary condition, we had k = mα / ℏ². Then normalization gives A = sqrt(k). Then the probability P = 1 - e^{-2k x₀} set to 1/2 gives x₀ = ln 2/(2k). Substituting k gives the answer. \n\nYes, seems correct. Let me check the algebra again:\n\nx₀ = ln(2)/(2k) and k = mα/ℏ², so x₀ = ln(2) * ℏ²/(2 m α). Yes. So that's option D. \n\nBut let me check if the options have different expressions. For example, ln(4) is 2 ln 2, so if I had ln(4)/something, but no. Option D is ln(2) multiplied by ℏ²/(2mα), which matches my result. So answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check once again the calculation of the integral. The probability is 1 - e^{-2k x₀} equals 1/2. Therefore, e^{-2k x₀} = 1/2. Taking natural logarithm: -2k x₀ = -ln 2 ⇒ x₀ = ln 2/(2k). Correct. \n\nTherefore, yes, answer is D. So the correct option is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
