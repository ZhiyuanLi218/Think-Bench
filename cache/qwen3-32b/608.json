The options are A, B, C, D. Let me start by recalling what I know about dipole transitions.\n\nFirst, the dipole transition selection rules. From what I remember, for electric dipole (E1) transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by any amount, but the angular momentum quantum numbers l and m have these specific changes. \n\nSo the initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0> and the final state is |n=1, l=0, m=0>. Since it's a two-step transition, it must go through an intermediate state with l=1 because each dipole transition requires a change in l by ±1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. \n\nLet me think about the first transition from |3,0,0> to some |2,1,m> state. Then from that intermediate state to |1,0,0>. Let me check the selection rules for each step.\n\nFirst step: from l=0 to l=1. That's Δl=+1, which is allowed. The m value can change by 0, +1, or -1. But the initial m is 0, so possible m's for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1. Similarly, the second step is from l=1 to l=0, which is Δl=-1, allowed. The m in the final state is 0, so from the intermediate state's m, we need Δm=0, +1, or -1 to get to m=0. \n\nSo for the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the m of the intermediate state must be such that it can transition to m=0. That would require that the intermediate m is either -1, 0, or +1. Because from m=-1 you can go to m=0 (Δm=+1), from m=0 to m=0 (Δm=0), and from m=+1 to m=0 (Δm=-1). All of these are allowed. So all three possible m values (-1, 0, +1) for the intermediate state can transition to the final state.\n\nBut the question is about the probability of each transition route. The options given are different routes and their probabilities. The probabilities probably depend on the number of possible intermediate states that can contribute and the corresponding transition probabilities.\n\nNow, the initial state |3,0,0> can transition to any of the |2,1,m> states where m is -1, 0, +1. However, the probability of each transition would depend on the matrix elements of the dipole moment operator. But in hydrogen atom, for the same l and different m states, the transition probabilities might be the same due to spherical symmetry? Or maybe not?\n\nWait, the dipole operator is proportional to the position vector, which can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics of l=1. So the matrix element for the transition from |n', l', m'> to |n, l, m> is proportional to the integral of Y_{l,m}^* r Y_{l',m'}, which involves Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nThe selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 comes from this. The actual probability (Einstein A coefficient) for each transition depends on the square of the matrix element. For a given Δl=±1 and Δm, the probabilities might be the same for different m's if we consider all possible polarizations of the photon. However, when considering the total decay rate, if the initial state is in a specific m state, the probabilities for different intermediate m's might differ.\n\nBut in this case, the initial state is |3,0,0>, which is m=0. So for the first transition, the dipole transition from m=0 to intermediate m can be -1, 0, +1. However, the matrix element for the transition from m=0 to m' would depend on the component of the dipole operator. For example, the dipole operator can be decomposed into components corresponding to Δm = -1, 0, +1. \n\nThe transition probability for a specific Δm is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For a transition from l=0, m=0 to l=1, m=m', the allowed Δm is m' - 0 = m', so m' can be -1, 0, +1. But since the initial state is spherically symmetric (m=0), the probabilities for each m' should be equal? Or maybe not?\n\nWait, if the initial state is |l=0, m=0>, which is spherically symmetric, then the probability of transitioning to each of the |l=1, m=-1>, |0>, |+1> states should be the same because there's no preferred direction. Therefore, the probability would be equally distributed among the three possible m states. So each of the three possible intermediate states would have 1/3 probability for the first transition.\n\nSimilarly, for the second transition from each intermediate state to the final state |1,0,0>, each of those transitions would have some probability. But again, if the intermediate state is |2,1,m>, then the transition to |1,0,0> would have probabilities depending on m. However, since the final state is m=0, the allowed Δm for the second transition is -m (from intermediate m to final m=0). So for example, if intermediate m is +1, then Δm = -1; if intermediate m is 0, Δm=0; if intermediate m is -1, Δm=+1. All of these are allowed. And again, if the intermediate state is in a specific m, the probability might depend on the direction, but if we consider all possible polarizations or average over them, perhaps each transition from a specific m to m=0 would have the same probability?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability for each route is the product of the probabilities for each step. Assuming that each first step (from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>) has probability 1/3, and each second step (from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>) has probability 1 (since they are allowed), then the total probability for each route would be 1/3. But since there are three possible routes (A, B, C), each with 1/3 probability? But the options given are different.\n\nWait, but the options are giving probabilities for each specific route. For example, option C says the route through |2,1,0> has probability 1/3. Option D says same route with probability 2/3. How do we calculate the actual probabilities?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total decay rate is the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for each allowed transition. But since the initial state is |3,0,0>, which is a superposition of different m states? No, wait, |3,0,0> is a specific state with n=3, l=0, m=0. So it's not a superposition of different m states. \n\nBut the dipole transition operator has components that can change m by -1, 0, +1. For example, in the dipole approximation, the transition matrix element is proportional to <n', l', m'| r |n, l, m>. For the first transition, from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m'>, the matrix element will be non-zero only if Δm = m' - 0 = m', so m' can be -1, 0, +1. The magnitude of the matrix element depends on the component of r that causes that Δm. \n\nIn the case of hydrogen, the matrix elements for transitions with different Δm can be related by symmetry. For example, the matrix element for Δm=+1, 0, -1 might have the same magnitude if we average over all possible polarizations of the emitted photon. However, if the atom is in a specific state without any preferred direction (like m=0), then the total decay rate would be the sum of the decay rates for each possible m' in the intermediate state. \n\nBut since the initial state is spherically symmetric (m=0), and the dipole transitions can emit photons in any direction, the total probability should be equally distributed among the three possible m' values. Therefore, each of the three possible intermediate states (m=-1, 0, +1) would have equal probability for the first transition. So each of the three routes (A, B, C) would have 1/3 probability. However, looking at the options, option C is |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> with probability 1/3, which matches this reasoning. But option D says same route with probability 2/3. So why is there discrepancy?\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that the second transition also has probabilities. Suppose that for each intermediate state, the probability to decay to the final state is not 1, but depends on the number of allowed transitions. Wait, but the second transition is from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. The selection rules are satisfied for all m=-1,0,+1. So each of these intermediate states can decay to the final state. However, the probability for each second transition might also depend on m. \n\nBut again, if we consider that the intermediate state is in a specific m, and the final state is m=0, then the transition probability would depend on the matrix element. However, if the intermediate state is in m=0, then the transition to m=0 requires Δm=0, which is allowed. Similarly for m=±1. But again, if the intermediate state is in a specific m, the probability for the second transition might be the same for each m. \n\nBut here's another thought: the total probability for the two-step process is the product of the probability for the first transition and the probability for the second transition. If each first transition has probability 1/3 (since three possible m's) and each second transition has probability 1 (since they are allowed), then the total probability for each route is 1/3. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C, which is the route through |2,1,0> with probability 1/3. However, option D says the same route with probability 2/3. That suggests that perhaps my assumption that each first transition has equal probability is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities aren't equally distributed among the m states. Let me think about the actual matrix elements. The dipole transition matrix element from |n=3, l=0, m=0> to |n=2, l=1, m=m'> is proportional to the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the position vector. \n\nFor hydrogen atom wavefunctions, the radial part and the angular part can be separated. The angular part for the initial state is Y_{0,0} which is a constant. The angular part for the intermediate state is Y_{1,m'}. The position vector r can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics of l=1. Specifically, the vector r can be associated with spherical vector harmonics, and the matrix element would involve integrals of Y_{1,m'}^* * r * Y_{0,0}.\n\nThe integral ∫ Y_{1,m'}^* r Y_{0,0} dΩ. Since Y_{0,0} is a constant (1/√(4π)), and r is proportional to r times some spherical harmonics. Wait, actually, the position vector components can be related to spherical harmonics. For example, the component of r in the direction corresponding to Δm=+1, 0, -1. \n\nThe integral ∫ Y_{l',m'}^* r Y_{l,m} dΩ is non-zero only if the angular parts satisfy certain conditions. For l=0 to l'=1, this integral is non-zero because r is proportional to l=1 spherical harmonics. The exact value depends on m'. \n\nBut since Y_{0,0} is spherically symmetric, the integral ∫ Y_{1,m'}^* r Y_{0,0} dΩ would be proportional to some constants depending on m'. However, due to spherical symmetry, all directions are equivalent, so the magnitude of the matrix element should be the same for all m'. Therefore, the probabilities for each m' in the first transition would be the same. Hence, each of the three possible intermediate states would have equal probability, so 1/3 each. Then, for each of those, the second transition would also have the same probability. Therefore, each route (A, B, C) would have probability 1/3. \n\nBut looking at the options, option C is given with probability 1/3, and option D is the same route with 2/3. So why is there an option D? Maybe there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the total decay rate from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two-photon dipole transitions. However, the question says \"via two dipole transition\", meaning two-photon transition? But the options show two steps, each being a dipole transition. So it's a two-step process, each step is a dipole transition. \n\nBut in reality, two-photon transitions have different selection rules and probabilities. However, the question is about non-relativistic theory and standard dipole transitions. Wait, but a single dipole transition can't go from n=3, l=0 to n=1, l=0 directly because Δl=0 is not allowed for dipole. Hence, it must go via an intermediate state with l=1. So it's a two-step process: first dipole to l=1, then another dipole to l=0. \n\nNow, the total probability for the entire process would be the sum of the probabilities for each possible route. So if there are three possible routes (through m=-1, 0, +1), each with probability (probability of first transition) × (probability of second transition). Assuming that each first transition has probability P1 and each second transition has probability P2, and if P1 and P2 are same for all m, then total probability is 3 × P1×P2. But the question is asking about the probability of each specific route. \n\nBut the options are giving probabilities for individual routes. For example, option C is one specific route with probability 1/3. If there are three routes each with probability 1/3, then total probability is 1. However, in reality, the total probability for the two-photon decay might not be 1, but the question is about the relative probabilities of the routes. \n\nBut maybe there's another consideration. The initial state |3,0,0> can decay to any of the |2,1,m> states, but the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> might have different probabilities depending on m. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that they should be same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second transition probabilities depend on m. Let me think about the second transition: from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. The dipole transition again requires Δl=-1 and Δm=0, ±1. For the final state m=0, so Δm = 0 - m. So if the intermediate state has m=+1, then Δm=-1; if m=0, Δm=0; if m=-1, Δm=+1. All are allowed. \n\nAgain, due to spherical symmetry, the probabilities for these transitions should be same for each m. Therefore, each second transition would have same probability. \n\nTherefore, if both transitions have same probabilities for each m, then the total probability for each route is (probability of first transition) × (probability of second transition). Assuming that for each route, both transitions are allowed and have same probability, then each route would have same probability. Since there are three routes, each would have 1/3 probability. Hence, option C is correct with probability 1/3. \n\nBut option D says the same route with probability 2/3. Where could this come from? Maybe I missed something about the number of states or the degeneracy?\n\nWait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, which is non-degenerate (since l=0, m=0). The intermediate states are |2,1,m> with m=-1,0,+1. Each of these states is degenerate. However, when considering the transition probabilities, we need to consider all possible intermediate states. \n\nBut in the case of the two-photon transition, the total amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes for each possible route. However, if the question is about the probability of each specific route (i.e., which intermediate m is taken), then each route would have equal probability if the matrix elements are same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability isn't just 1/3 because the second transition might not have equal probability. For example, maybe the second transition from m=0 has a higher probability? \n\nWait, let's think about the actual matrix elements. For the first transition, the matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m| r |3,0,0>. As mentioned earlier, due to spherical symmetry, the magnitude of this matrix element should be same for all m. Therefore, the probability for each first transition is same. Similarly, the second transition matrix element <1,0,0| r |2,1,m> should also have same magnitude for all m. Therefore, the total probability for each route is same, hence 1/3 for each. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, which is the route through |2,1,0> with probability 1/3. However, option D says same route with probability 2/3. That suggests maybe there's a miscalculation in considering the number of possible routes. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the probability of each specific route, but the total probability for all routes that go through certain m's. For example, maybe some routes have same probabilities and need to be summed. \n\nBut the options are labeled as specific routes. For example, option C is the route through m=0 with probability 1/3. Option D is same route with probability 2/3. How could that be?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that each route has probability 1/3. Perhaps the total probability is distributed differently. Let me think about the actual calculation.\n\nThe total probability for the two-step process can be calculated using the formula for two-photon transitions. However, since this is a hydrogen atom problem in non-relativistic theory, maybe there's a known result.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The initial state |3,0,0> has l=0, so it's spherically symmetric. The dipole transition operator connects it to states with l=1. The intermediate state is a combination of |2,1,m> states. However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the amplitude for each m should be same. Therefore, the probability for each m is same, hence 1/3. Then, from each intermediate state, the amplitude to go to |1,0,0> is same for each m, so again 1/3. Therefore, each route has probability 1/3. \n\nBut wait, the total probability would be sum over all routes of their probabilities, which would be 3*(1/3 * something). But if each route has probability 1/3, then total probability would be 1, which can't be right because the atom can decay via other pathways as well. However, the question is specifically about the decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions, so maybe in this context, the total probability is considered as 1 for the sum of all possible two-step routes. But that doesn't make sense because the atom could also decay via other routes, like going to other n levels before reaching |1,0,0>. However, the question is specifically about the route through n=2, so maybe we are to assume that all decay goes through n=2? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the relative probabilities among the given options, not the absolute probabilities. If the correct answer is that each of the three routes (A, B, C) has probability 1/3, but none of the options state that. The options are A: 1/4, B: 1/4, C: 1/3, D: 2/3. \n\nWait, maybe there's a different approach. The state |3,0,0> can be expressed in terms of the intermediate states. But since it's l=0, it's a spherical harmonic Y_{0,0}. The dipole operator is proportional to r, which can be expressed as r Y_{1,m} in spherical coordinates. The matrix element for the first transition is <Y_{1,m} | r | Y_{0,0}>, which is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m}^* r Y_{0,0}. Since Y_{0,0} is a constant, this integral becomes proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m}^* r times constant. But r is a vector, so maybe this is more complex. \n\nActually, the position vector r can be written in terms of spherical harmonics multiplied by r. Specifically, the components of r can be associated with spherical harmonics of l=1. For example, the spherical vector harmonics. However, the integral ∫ Y_{1,m}^* r Y_{0,0} dΩ would involve coupling the l=0 and l=1 to get l=1. The integral is non-zero only if the angular parts match. But since Y_{0,0} is a constant, multiplying by r (which has angular dependence of Y_{1,m}) would give something proportional to Y_{1,m}. Integrating Y_{1,m}^* times Y_{1,m} would give δ_{mm'}, but here we are integrating Y_{1,m'}^* times Y_{1,m}... Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe state |l=0, m=0> can be coupled with the dipole operator (which has l=1) to give a state with l=1. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is such that |l=0, m=0> ⊗ |l=1, m'> = |l=1, m'>. Therefore, the amplitude for each m' is same? Or is there a specific coefficient?\n\nActually, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling |j1=0, m1=0> and |j2=1, m2=m> to get |j=1, m=m> is 1, since there's only one way to combine them. Therefore, the matrix element for each m is same, hence the probability is same for each m. Therefore, each of the three possible m's has equal probability, so 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, which is the route through |2,1,0> with probability 1/3. But why is option D present with probability 2/3? Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4\n\nB: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4\n\nC: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3\n\nD: same as C but probability 2/3\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the probability of the intermediate state being |2,1,0>, not the entire route. If the question is asking for the probability of going through |2,1,0> in the intermediate step, then since there are three possible m's, each with probability 1/3, the total probability for the route through m=0 would be 1/3. Hence, option C is correct. \n\nBut why do options A and B have 1/4? That suggests that maybe there's a different distribution. Perhaps the initial state isn't just |3,0,0>, but a superposition? No, the question states it's the |3,0,0> state. \n\nWait, another possibility: the decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> can go through other intermediate states besides n=2. But the question specifies that it's via two dipole transitions, so maybe it's only through n=2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of possible routes is four, and hence probabilities are fractions like 1/4. But there are three possible m's for the intermediate state. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the probability of each specific transition, considering that the dipole transition probabilities depend on the square of the matrix element, and for certain m's, the matrix elements are zero or different. But earlier reasoning suggested they are same. \n\nWait, let me look up the actual formula for the dipole transition probabilities. The Einstein A coefficient for a transition is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. For hydrogen atom, the dipole matrix element for transitions with same Δl and Δm should have same magnitude. \n\nFor example, the transition from |n=3, l=0, m=0> to |n=2, l=1, m=+1> would have a dipole matrix element proportional to some constant. Similarly for m=0 and m=-1. Due to spherical symmetry, these constants should be same in magnitude. Therefore, the probabilities for each first transition are same. Hence, each has probability 1/3. \n\nThen, the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> would also have same probability for each m. Hence, each route has probability 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C. But why is option D present? Maybe the question is considering that the intermediate state |2,1,0> has higher probability because it's a single state, whereas the other two routes (m=+1 and -1) are two different routes but with same probability? No, the options A and B are separate routes with their own probabilities. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the question, and the correct probability is 1/3 for each of the three routes. But in the options given, only option C has 1/3. Hence, option C is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the probability of the entire two-photon transition, and the probabilities for each m are not 1/3 but different. For example, maybe the second transition has different probabilities. \n\nLet me think about the second transition: from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. The dipole matrix element is proportional to <1,0,0| r |2,1,m>. Again, due to spherical symmetry, these should be same for all m. Hence, the probabilities are same. \n\nTherefore, the total probability for each route is same, hence 1/3. Therefore, option C is correct. \n\nBut the options also include D, which says same route with probability 2/3. This suggests that maybe there's a miscalculation where the probability for the route through m=0 is higher. Perhaps the initial assumption about equal probabilities is wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the state |3,0,0> can be expressed in terms of the intermediate states. However, since it's l=0, it's a scalar, and the dipole operator (vector) would create a vector state. The intermediate state is a vector (l=1), so the amplitude for each m is same. Therefore, the probability is same for each m. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option C. The options A and B have 1/4, which doesn't fit with three possible routes. Maybe there's a typo in the question, but based on the reasoning, option C is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check another source or recall if there's a standard result for this. For example, in the hydrogen atom, the 3s state (n=3, l=0) decays to 1s (n=1, l=0) via two-photon transitions. The two-photon decay can go through 2p (n=2, l=1) states. The probabilities for different m states in the intermediate step. \n\nAccording to some references, the two-photon decay of 3s → 1s goes through 2p states. The decay rate is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate states. However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the decay rates for each m in the intermediate state are same. Therefore, each route contributes equally. Hence, the probability for each route is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, option C is correct. Hence, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
