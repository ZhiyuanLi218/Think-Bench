The experiment demonstrated the existence of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom. However, **no actual change occurs in the nucleus** during this process; it is essentially a *probe* of the atom's internal structure. Therefore, it is **not** related to a change in the nucleus itself.\n\n---\n\n### (B) **Natural Radioactivity Phenomenon**  \nNatural radioactivity involves the spontaneous emission of particles or electromagnetic radiation from the nucleus of an atom. This process includes **nuclear transformations** such as alpha decay (emission of helium nucleus), beta decay (conversion of a neutron to a proton or vice versa), and gamma decay (release of energy from an excited nucleus). These are **clear examples of changes within the nucleus**, making this the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### (C) **Photoelectric Effect Phenomenon**  \nIn the photoelectric effect, light (in the form of photons) strikes a material and causes electrons to be emitted from its surface. This is a **surface-level interaction involving electrons**, not the nucleus. The nucleus remains unaffected during this process.\n\n---\n\n### (D) **Atomic Luminescence Phenomenon**  \nThis occurs when electrons in atoms absorb energy and jump to higher energy levels, then fall back to lower levels, emitting light in the process. This is an **electronic transition**, not a nuclear event. Thus, it is **not** related to the nucleus changing.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these phenomena is related to changes within the atomic nucleus. Let's start by recalling what each of these phenomena involves.\n\nFirst, the α particle scattering phenomenon. I remember that this is the experiment done by Rutherford where he shot alpha particles at a gold foil and observed some deflection. That experiment was crucial in discovering the nucleus of the atom. But does the scattering itself involve changes in the nucleus? I think in that experiment, the alpha particles were just bouncing off the nucleus, but the nucleus itself wasn't changing. The atom's structure was probed, but the nucleus wasn't undergoing any transformation. So maybe that's not the right answer.\n\nNext, natural radioactivity. I know that radioactivity involves the decay of atomic nuclei, emitting alpha, beta, or gamma radiation. If the nucleus is emitting particles or energy, that definitely involves changes within the nucleus. So this might be the correct answer. Let me hold onto that thought.\n\nThe photoelectric effect is when light (photons) hits a material and ejects electrons from the surface. This is about electrons in the atom's outer shells being emitted, not the nucleus. Einstein explained this with photons transferring energy to electrons. So that's not related to the nucleus changing.\n\nAtomic luminescence, like when atoms emit light. This usually happens when electrons transition between energy levels. For example, in fluorescent lights or neon signs, electrons get excited to higher energy levels and then drop back down, emitting photons. Again, this is about electron transitions, not the nucleus. So that's not it either.\n\nSo, going back: α scattering is about probing the nucleus structure, but no change in the nucleus. Natural radioactivity is about the nucleus decaying, which is a change. So the answer should be B. Let me just double-check. Radioactive decay changes the nucleus into a different element or isotope, right? Yes, that's a nuclear change. The others are about electrons. So yeah, B is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
