The pion has a momentum of 5 m_pi c, and the proton is initially at rest. The mass of the proton is given as 7 times the mass of the pion. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in collisions, the center of mass (COM) frame is the frame where the total momentum is zero. So, I need to calculate the velocity of this frame relative to the lab frame where the proton is at rest. To do that, I probably need to use the concept of relativistic momentum and maybe some equations related to the COM frame.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions it's an elastic collision, but actually, since we are only asked about the speed of the COM frame before the collision occurs, maybe I don't need to consider the collision details? Because the COM velocity depends only on the initial momenta and masses of the particles, right? So regardless of what happens during the collision, the COM frame's velocity is determined by the initial conditions.\n\nSo, let me recall the formula for the velocity of the center of mass. In classical mechanics, the velocity of the COM is given by the total momentum divided by the total mass. But since we're dealing with relativistic momentum here (because the pion has a momentum of 5 m_pi c, which is quite large), I need to use relativistic equations.\n\nWait, but is the formula for COM velocity the same in relativity? Hmm. Actually, in relativity, the concept is similar but needs to be adjusted because momentum and energy are part of the four-vector. However, if we are just looking for the velocity of the COM frame, which is the frame where the total momentum is zero, we can use the total momentum and total energy to find it.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula that relates the velocity of the COM frame (let's call it V) to the initial momenta and masses. Let me think.\n\nIn the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the pion is moving with momentum p = 5 m_pi c. Let me denote the pion's mass as m and the proton's mass as 7m. So m_p = 7 m_pi = 7m.\n\nIn the lab frame, the total momentum is just the momentum of the pion, since the proton is at rest. So total momentum P_total = p_pion = 5 m c.\n\nThe total energy in the lab frame is the sum of the energies of the pion and the proton. The proton's energy is just its rest energy, E_proton = m_p c² = 7m c².\n\nThe pion's energy is a bit more complicated because it's moving. Its total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy, but since we know its momentum, maybe we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\nThe energy-momentum relation is E² = (p c)² + (m c²)². So for the pion, E_pion² = (5 m c * c)² + (m c²)² = (25 m² c⁴) + (m² c⁴) = 26 m² c⁴. Therefore, E_pion = sqrt(26) m c².\n\nTherefore, the total energy in the lab frame is E_total = E_pion + E_proton = sqrt(26) m c² + 7 m c².\n\nNow, in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero. The velocity of the COM frame relative to the lab frame can be found by considering the total energy and momentum. There's a relation between the velocity of the COM frame and the total momentum and energy.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about transforming to the COM frame, the velocity V can be found such that when we boost the lab frame by -V, the total momentum becomes zero.\n\nIn relativity, the velocity of the COM frame can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (P_total c²) / E_total\n\nWait, is that right? Let me recall. In special relativity, the velocity of the center of momentum frame can be found by dividing the total momentum by the total energy (in units where c=1). So if we have total momentum P and total energy E, then the velocity of the COM frame is v = P c² / E. Yes, that seems familiar.\n\nSo if I take P_total as the total momentum in the lab frame, which is 5 m c, and E_total as the total energy, which is [sqrt(26) + 7] m c², then V = (P_total c²) / E_total.\n\nWait, but let me check the units. Let me write it properly.\n\nThe velocity V is equal to (total momentum * c²) divided by total energy. Since momentum has units of [mass][length]/[time], energy has units of [mass][length]²/[time]². So multiplying momentum by c² gives [mass][length]/[time] * [length]²/[time]² = [mass][length]^3/[time]^3? Wait, no, that seems messy. Maybe better to think in terms of natural units where c=1. But perhaps I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in special relativity, the velocity of the COM frame can be calculated as:\n\nV = (p_total c²) / E_total\n\nBut let me verify this with a simple case. Suppose we have two particles with momentum p and -p in some frame. Then total momentum is zero, so that frame is the COM frame. If we have another frame where their momenta are different, then to find the COM velocity, we can use this formula.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero. So if we have a system with total energy E and total momentum P in some frame, then the velocity of the COM frame relative to that frame is given by:\n\nV = (P c²) / E\n\nYes, this is a standard result. For example, see the relation between the velocity of a system and its energy and momentum. The velocity is the ratio of the momentum times c² over the energy.\n\nTherefore, in our case:\n\nV = (P_total * c²) / E_total\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute P_total: that's just the momentum of the pion since the proton is at rest. So P_total = 5 m_pi c. Given that m_pi is the mass of the pion, but we can write everything in terms of m (where m = m_pi, m_p = 7m). So P_total = 5 m c.\n\nE_total is E_pion + E_proton. As we computed before:\n\nE_pion = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( (5 m c * c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(25 m² c^4 + m² c^4) = sqrt(26) m c².\n\nE_proton is just its rest energy: m_p c² = 7 m c².\n\nTherefore, E_total = sqrt(26) m c² + 7 m c² = [sqrt(26) + 7] m c².\n\nTherefore, substituting into V:\n\nV = [5 m c * c²] / [ (sqrt(26) + 7) m c² ] = [5 c³] / [ (sqrt(26) + 7) c² ] = 5 c / (sqrt(26) + 7 )\n\nWait, hold on, the numerator is P_total * c², which is 5 m c * c² = 5 m c³. The denominator is E_total = [sqrt(26) + 7] m c². Therefore, dividing them:\n\nV = (5 m c³) / ( [sqrt(26) + 7] m c² ) = 5 c / (sqrt(26) + 7 )\n\nYes, the m cancels, and c³ / c² is c. So we get V = 5c / (sqrt(26) + 7). That seems okay.\n\nBut maybe we can rationalize the denominator or write it in a different form? Let me see. Alternatively, compute the numerical value?\n\nBut perhaps they want an exact expression? Let me check if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, in non-relativistic mechanics, the velocity of the COM is (m1 v1 + m2 v2)/(m1 + m2). But here, since the proton is at rest, v2 = 0, so V_COM = (m1 v1)/(m1 + m2). But this is non-relativistic. However, in our case, the pion has a momentum of 5 m_pi c, which is quite large, so relativistic effects are significant. Therefore, we can't use the non-relativistic formula. Hence, our previous approach is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's a way to express the velocity in terms of beta (β = v/c). Let me compute β = V / c = 5 / (sqrt(26) + 7). Let me rationalize this expression.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(26) - 7):\n\nβ = [5 (sqrt(26) - 7)] / [ (sqrt(26) + 7)(sqrt(26) - 7) ] = [5 (sqrt(26) - 7)] / [26 - 49] = [5 (sqrt(26) - 7)] / (-23) = [5 (7 - sqrt(26))]/23\n\nTherefore, β = 5(7 - sqrt(26))/23 ≈ let me compute the numerical value.\n\nFirst compute sqrt(26): sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(26) ≈ 5.1. Let me calculate it more accurately. 5.1² = 26.01, so sqrt(26) ≈ 5.099. Let me use calculator-like approx.\n\nsqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990.\n\nSo 7 - sqrt(26) ≈ 7 - 5.0990 ≈ 1.901.\n\nMultiply by 5: 5 * 1.901 ≈ 9.505.\n\nDivide by 23: 9.505 / 23 ≈ 0.413.\n\nTherefore, β ≈ 0.413, so V ≈ 0.413 c.\n\nBut let me check if my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me redo the rationalizing:\n\nOriginal expression for β is 5 / (sqrt(26) + 7). Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(26) - 7):\n\nNumerator becomes 5*(sqrt(26) - 7)\n\nDenominator becomes (sqrt(26))² - (7)² = 26 - 49 = -23.\n\nTherefore, β = [5*(sqrt(26) - 7)] / (-23) = [ -5*(sqrt(26) - 7) ] / 23 = [5*(7 - sqrt(26))]/23. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo β ≈ 5*(7 - 5.099)/23 ≈ 5*(1.901)/23 ≈ 9.505 / 23 ≈ 0.413. So V ≈ 0.413 c.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an exact expression? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach using Lorentz transformations? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momentum of the pion and the momentum of the proton are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, p_pion = -p_proton.\n\nBut maybe we can use this to find the velocity? Let me try.\n\nLet me denote the velocity of the COM frame as V. Then, in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity V relative to the COM frame, the proton is initially at rest. Wait, no, the COM frame is moving at velocity V relative to the lab frame. Wait, the proton is at rest in the lab frame, and the COM frame is moving at velocity V relative to the lab frame. Therefore, in the COM frame, the proton has velocity -V (since in the lab frame it's at rest, so in the COM frame it's moving at -V). Similarly, the pion is moving with some velocity in the lab frame, so in the COM frame its velocity is v_pion - V, where v_pion is its velocity in the lab frame.\n\nBut since the total momentum in the COM frame is zero, we have:\n\ngamma_pion * m_pi * (v_pion - V) + gamma_proton * m_proton * (-V) = 0\n\nThis seems complicated because we need to find v_pion from its momentum. Let me see if this approach is feasible.\n\nWe know the momentum of the pion in the lab frame is p_pi = 5 m_pi c. The relation between momentum and velocity is p = gamma m v. Therefore, gamma m v = 5 m c => gamma v = 5 c. So gamma v = 5 c.\n\nBut gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Therefore:\n\nv / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 5 c.\n\nLet me solve for v.\n\nLet me denote β = v/c. Then:\n\nβ c / sqrt(1 - β²) = 5 c => β / sqrt(1 - β²) = 5 => square both sides:\n\nβ² / (1 - β²) = 25 => β² = 25 (1 - β²) => β² = 25 - 25 β² => 26 β² = 25 => β² = 25/26 => β = 5 / sqrt(26) ≈ 5 / 5.1 ≈ 0.98. Wait, sqrt(26) ≈ 5.1, so 5 / 5.1 ≈ 0.98. Therefore, the velocity of the pion in the lab frame is approximately 0.98 c. So that's very relativistic. Which makes sense, since its momentum is 5 m c, which is much larger than its rest mass energy.\n\nTherefore, in the lab frame, the pion's velocity is v_pi = (5 / sqrt(26)) c ≈ 0.98 c.\n\nSo going back to the previous equation for the COM frame:\n\ngamma_pi * m_pi * (v_pi - V) + gamma_proton * m_proton * (-V) = 0\n\nBut since the proton is initially at rest in the lab frame, in the COM frame, its velocity is -V. But gamma_proton would be gamma for the proton's speed in the COM frame? Wait, no. Wait, if in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, then in the COM frame, it's moving at velocity -V. Therefore, gamma_proton is gamma for speed V.\n\nSimilarly, the pion is moving at velocity v_pi - V in the COM frame, so its gamma is gamma for speed (v_pi - V). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\ngamma_pion_frame_COM * m_pi * (v_pi - V) + gamma_proton_frame_COM * m_proton * (-V) = 0\n\nBut this seems complex because we need to calculate gamma for both particles in the COM frame. However, since we already have the velocity of the COM frame from the earlier method, maybe this approach is more complicated. But let me see if we can use it to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the earlier result. Since we found V ≈ 0.413 c, let's check if this satisfies the momentum condition.\n\nLet me compute for the proton: in the COM frame, its velocity is -V. Therefore, its momentum is gamma_proton * m_proton * (-V). For the pion, its velocity in the COM frame is v_pi - V. Let me compute that.\n\nv_pi is (5 / sqrt(26)) c ≈ 0.98 c, and V ≈ 0.413 c. So v_pi - V ≈ 0.98c - 0.413c ≈ 0.567c. Then, the momentum of the pion in the COM frame is gamma_pion_COM * m_pi * 0.567c. The proton's momentum is -gamma_proton_COM * m_proton * V.\n\nFor the total momentum to be zero, these should be equal in magnitude.\n\nBut let me compute with exact expressions.\n\nLet me denote V = 5c / (sqrt(26) + 7). Let me compute v_pi - V.\n\nWe have v_pi = (5 / sqrt(26)) c.\n\nSo v_pi - V = [5 / sqrt(26) - 5 / (sqrt(26) + 7)] c.\n\nLet me compute that term:\n\nLet me factor out 5c:\n\n5c [ 1 / sqrt(26) - 1 / (sqrt(26) + 7) ].\n\nCompute the difference in the brackets:\n\nLet me find a common denominator:\n\n[ (sqrt(26) + 7) - sqrt(26) ] / [ sqrt(26)(sqrt(26) + 7) ) ] = 7 / [ sqrt(26)(sqrt(26) + 7) ) ]\n\nTherefore, v_pi - V = 5c * 7 / [ sqrt(26)(sqrt(26) + 7) ) ] = 35 c / [ sqrt(26)(sqrt(26) + 7) ) ]\n\nNow, let me compute the momentum of the pion in the COM frame. It's gamma_pion_COM * m_pi * (v_pi - V). However, calculating gamma_pion_COM would require knowing the speed (v_pi - V), which we just found. This seems complex. However, since we already have that the total momentum is zero by construction from the energy-momentum method, maybe this is redundant. But just to check consistency.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, and we derived V using the energy-momentum relation, which is a standard method, I think our initial result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the COM frame is V = 5c / (sqrt(26) + 7). Let me rationalize this expression again for a cleaner answer.\n\nAs we did before:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(26) - 7):\n\nV = [5c (sqrt(26) - 7)] / [ (sqrt(26) + 7)(sqrt(26) - 7) ] = [5c (sqrt(26) - 7)] / (26 - 49) = [5c (sqrt(26) - 7)] / (-23) = [5c (7 - sqrt(26))]/23.\n\nSo, V = [5(7 - sqrt(26))/23] c.\n\nThis is an exact expression. If we want to write it as a decimal, we can compute the numerical value.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990.\n\nThen 7 - sqrt(26) ≈ 7 - 5.0990 ≈ 1.9010.\n\nMultiply by 5: 1.9010 * 5 ≈ 9.505.\n\nDivide by 23: 9.505 / 23 ≈ 0.41326.\n\nTherefore, V ≈ 0.413 c. So approximately 41.3% the speed of light.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me compute the total energy and total momentum.\n\nTotal momentum P_total = 5 m c.\n\nTotal energy E_total = sqrt(26) m c² + 7 m c² ≈ (5.099 + 7) m c² ≈ 12.099 m c².\n\nThen V = (P_total c²)/E_total = (5 m c * c²) / (12.099 m c²) ) = (5 c³) / (12.099 c²) ) ≈ (5 / 12.099) c ≈ 0.413 c. Yep, same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the exact value is [5(7 - sqrt(26))/23] c, and approximately 0.413 c. Depending on what the problem expects, maybe we can write both, but since it's a physics problem, they might prefer an exact expression. However, let me check if there's a simpler exact form or if they want a numerical value.\n\nBut let me see if the exact expression can be simplified further. The expression is already simplified as [5(7 - sqrt(26))/23] c. Alternatively, we can write it as [35 - 5 sqrt(26)] / 23 c. But unless there's some further simplification, this is as simple as it gets.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if my initial approach was correct. Because in relativity, the velocity of the COM frame is given by total momentum times c squared over total energy. Let me confirm with another source or reasoning.\n\nYes, in special relativity, the velocity of the center of momentum frame is given by:\n\n**V** = ( **P** c² ) / E\n\nWhere **P** is the total momentum and E is the total energy. This comes from the fact that the four-momentum is (E/c, **P**), and the velocity of the frame where **P** = 0 is given by the boost that makes the spatial components zero. The boost parameter β is such that:\n\nβ = ( **P** c² ) / E\n\nWhich is what we used. Therefore, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the exact answer is V = [5(7 - sqrt(26))/23] c ≈ 0.413 c.\n\nBut let me check if there is a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate sqrt(26):\n\nsqrt(25) = 5, sqrt(26) ≈ 5.099019514.\n\nSo 7 - sqrt(26) ≈ 7 - 5.099019514 ≈ 1.900980486.\n\nMultiply by 5: ≈ 9.50490243.\n\nDivide by 23: ≈ 9.50490243 / 23 ≈ 0.413256627...\n\nSo approximately 0.4133 c. If we want to write this as a fraction times c, maybe round to three decimal places, 0.413 c. But perhaps the problem expects an exact symbolic expression.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there is an error in the energy calculation. Let me recalculate the pion's energy.\n\nGiven p = 5 m c, so p c = 5 m c². Then, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 = (25 m² c^4) + (m² c^4) = 26 m² c^4, so E = sqrt(26) m c². Correct. Then total energy is sqrt(26) m c² + 7 m c². Correct.\n\nTherefore, V = 5 c / (sqrt(26) + 7). Correct. Then rationalizing gives us the expression above. So that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it as a fraction with a rational denominator, that would be the way. Therefore, unless there is a different approach or a miscalculation, this should be correct.\n\nWait, let me check with another method. Let me compute the gamma factor for the COM frame velocity. Suppose we consider the total energy in the COM frame, which is the invariant quantity. The total energy in the COM frame is the total rest energy? No, the total energy in the COM frame is the sum of the relativistic energies, but since momentum is zero, the total energy is the rest energy of the system? Wait, no, unless it's a collision where particles stick together, but here it's an elastic collision, so the total energy is still the sum of the individual energies.\n\nBut the invariant quantity is the square of the total energy-momentum four-vector. The square of the total four-momentum is (E_total / c)^2 - (P_total)^2 = (m_total)^2 c², where m_total is the invariant mass of the system.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary here. However, let me compute it just to check.\n\nCompute (E_total / c)^2 - (P_total c)^2 = [ (sqrt(26) m c² + 7 m c²)/c ]² - [5 m c * c]^2 = [ (sqrt(26) + 7) m c ]² - [5 m c²]^2.\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term: (sqrt(26) + 7)^2 m² c² = [26 + 14 sqrt(26) + 49] m² c² = [75 + 14 sqrt(26)] m² c².\n\nSecond term: 25 m² c^4. Wait, no, units? Wait:\n\nWait, the first term is [ (sqrt(26) + 7) m c ]² = (sqrt(26) + 7)^2 m² c².\n\nThe second term is (P_total c)^2 = (5 m c)^2 * c² = 25 m² c^4? Wait no:\n\nWait, P_total is 5 m c (units of momentum: mass * velocity). Therefore, P_total c is 5 m c * c = 5 m c². Therefore, (P_total c)^2 = 25 m² c^4.\n\nBut the first term is [ (sqrt(26) + 7) m c ]² = (sqrt(26) + 7)^2 m² c². Wait, so units don't match? Wait, no, because the invariant is (E/c)^2 - (P)^2. Therefore, E/c has units of momentum, same as P. So:\n\n(E_total / c)^2 - (P_total)^2 should have units of momentum squared.\n\nLet me check:\n\nE_total / c has units of (energy / speed) = (mass * length² / time² ) / (length / time) ) = mass * length / time, which is momentum. Therefore, squared is momentum squared. Similarly, P_total squared is momentum squared. Therefore, the invariant is momentum squared.\n\nBut let me compute the numerical value:\n\nFirst term: (sqrt(26) + 7)^2 m² c² = [26 + 14 sqrt(26) + 49] m² c² = [75 + 14 sqrt(26)] m² c².\n\nSecond term: (P_total)^2 = (5 m c)^2 = 25 m² c².\n\nTherefore, the invariant is [75 + 14 sqrt(26) - 25] m² c² = [50 + 14 sqrt(26)] m² c².\n\nBut I don't know if this helps us here. However, in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the invariant is (E_com / c)^2. Therefore, E_com = sqrt( [50 + 14 sqrt(26)] ) m c². But I don't think this helps us find V directly.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that in the COM frame, the velocity V is such that the total momentum is zero, and we have already calculated it via two methods, and they agree, I think our result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is V = [5(7 - sqrt(26))/23] c, or approximately 0.413c.\n\nBut let me check if the question expects the answer in terms of fractions or decimals. The problem says \"Find the speed of the center of mass reference frame.\" It doesn't specify, but in physics problems like this, unless told otherwise, exact forms are preferred. So I think the exact expression is better here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want a numerical value? Let me check the numbers again.\n\nIf I compute 5(7 - sqrt(26))/23:\n\nFirst, sqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990\n\n7 - 5.0990 ≈ 1.9010\n\nMultiply by 5: ≈ 9.505\n\nDivide by 23 ≈ 0.41326...\n\nSo approximately 0.413 c. If we want to write it as a fraction, maybe 0.413 is roughly 0.41 c or 0.413 c. However, depending on the precision required, but since the problem gives exact values (momentum is 5 m_pi c, mass ratio is exact 7), they probably want an exact answer.\n\nTherefore, boxed, the exact answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5(7 - \\sqrt{26})}{23} c} or \\boxed{\\dfrac{35 - 5\\sqrt{26}}{23} c}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rationalizing was not necessary and leaving it as 5c/(sqrt(26) + 7) is acceptable. Let me see:\n\n5/(sqrt(26) + 7) is approximately 5/(5.099 + 7) ≈ 5/12.099 ≈ 0.413. But perhaps the former expression is simpler? It depends. In some contexts, having a rational denominator is preferred. In others, not. Since both are correct, but maybe the problem expects the rationalized form. Therefore, I think I'll go with the rationalized version.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5(7 - \\sqrt{26})}{23} c}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe speed of the center of mass reference frame is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5(7 - \\sqrt{26})}{23} c}.\n</think>"}
