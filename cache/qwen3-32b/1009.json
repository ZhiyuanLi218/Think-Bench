Let me start by understanding the problem again.\n\nEach S_k is an arithmetic sequence starting at 1 with a common difference of k. So for example, S_3 is 1, 4, 7, 10,... and so on. The question is asking how many different k's (positive integers) will make 2005 appear somewhere in their respective sequences.\n\nFirst, let me recall the general formula for an arithmetic sequence. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference d is given by:\n\na_n = a + (n - 1)d\n\nIn this case, the first term a is 1, and the common difference d is k. So the nth term of S_k is:\n\na_n = 1 + (n - 1)k\n\nWe need this term to be equal to 2005. So let me set up the equation:\n\n1 + (n - 1)k = 2005\n\nLet me solve for (n - 1)k:\n\n(n - 1)k = 2005 - 1 = 2004\n\nTherefore, (n - 1)k = 2004. Here, both n and k are positive integers, with n ≥ 1 (since it's the term number) and k ≥ 1 (as given in the problem). However, since n - 1 must also be a non-negative integer (because n ≥ 1), let me denote m = n - 1, so m ≥ 0. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nm * k = 2004\n\nBut since n must be at least 1, m can be 0 or more. However, m = 0 would correspond to the first term of the sequence, which is 1. But since we want 2005 to be in the sequence, m can't be zero because that would give 1 + 0*k = 1 ≠ 2005. Therefore, m must be at least 1. Wait, let me check:\n\nIf m = 0, then 1 + 0*k = 1. So if m = 0, we get the first term. If m = 1, then 1 + 1*k = 1 + k. So for m ≥ 1, the term is 1 + m*k. Wait, but in my earlier substitution, I had m = n - 1, so the term is 1 + m*k. Therefore, setting that equal to 2005:\n\n1 + m*k = 2005 ⇒ m*k = 2004. Therefore, m and k are positive integers such that their product is 2004. Therefore, m ≥ 1, k ≥ 1, integers.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of positive integers k such that k divides 2004, but with some conditions?\n\nWait, not exactly. Because m and k are positive integers such that m*k = 2004. Therefore, k must be a positive divisor of 2004, and m is the corresponding co-divisor. However, since m must also be a positive integer (since m = n - 1 ≥ 1 would mean n ≥ 2, but actually m can be zero? Wait, earlier I thought m must be at least 1 because otherwise 1 + 0*k = 1 ≠ 2005. Therefore, m must be such that m*k = 2004. Therefore, m must be a positive integer (since if m = 0, then 0*k = 0 ≠ 2004). Therefore, both m and k are positive integers. Therefore, the number of possible k's is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2004. However, we need to check if there are any restrictions on k.\n\nWait, but k is a positive integer, and m is also a positive integer. Therefore, each divisor k of 2004 (with k ≥ 1) corresponds to some m = 2004 / k, which is also a positive integer. Therefore, the number of possible k's is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2004.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check with the example given. For S_3, the sequence is 1, 4, 7, 10,... So let's check if 2005 is in S_3. For k = 3, we need to see if 2005 can be written as 1 + 3m. Then 3m = 2004, so m = 668. Which is an integer, so yes. Therefore, k = 3 is a valid value. So since 3 divides 2004, then yes. Therefore, if k divides 2004, then m = 2004 / k is integer, so 2005 is in S_k.\n\nBut wait, but if k divides 2004, then m is an integer, so 2005 is in the sequence. Therefore, the number of such k is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2004. However, the problem says \"For each positive integer k\", so k is a positive integer. However, in the problem statement, the sequences S_k are increasing arithmetic sequences. Since the common difference is k, which is positive, so the sequences are indeed increasing. Therefore, for each divisor k of 2004, the term 2005 is in S_k. Therefore, the answer is the number of positive divisors of 2004.\n\nBut let me check if there's a catch here. For example, if k is larger than 2004? Let's take k = 2004. Then the sequence is 1, 1 + 2004, 1 + 2*2004,... So 1, 2005, 4009,... So yes, 2005 is the second term. Therefore, k = 2004 is valid. Similarly, if k is larger than 2004, say k = 4008, then m*k = 2004 ⇒ m = 2004 / 4008 = 0.5, which is not integer. Therefore, for k > 2004, m would have to be less than 1, but since m must be positive integer, there's no solution. Therefore, only divisors of 2004 where k ≤ 2004. But since divisors of 2004 are all less than or equal to 2004 (since 2004 is a positive integer). Therefore, the number of positive divisors of 2004 is the answer.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute the number of positive divisors of 2004.\n\nTo find the number of positive divisors, I need to factor 2004 into its prime factors.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nFirst, divide by 2: 2004 ÷ 2 = 1002.\n\nAgain divide by 2: 1002 ÷ 2 = 501.\n\nNow 501: let's check divisibility by 3: 5 + 0 + 1 = 6, which is divisible by 3. 501 ÷ 3 = 167.\n\nNow check 167. Let me check if 167 is prime. Let me check divisibility by primes up to sqrt(167) ≈ 12.9.\n\nDivide by 2? No, it's odd. 3? 1 + 6 + 7 = 14, not divisible by 3. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 167 ÷ 7 is about 23.85... 7*23 = 161, 167 - 161 = 6, not divisible by 7. 11? 1 - 6 + 7 = 2, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*12 = 156, 13*13=169 > 167. So 167 is prime.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 2004 is 2^2 * 3^1 * 167^1.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive divisors is (2 + 1)*(1 + 1)*(1 + 1) = 3*2*2 = 12.\n\nWait, so there are 12 positive divisors. Therefore, the answer is 12? But let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula is, if the prime factorization is p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the number of divisors is (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)...(an + 1). So here, exponents are 2, 1, 1. Therefore, (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3*2*2=12. So 12 divisors.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 12? But let me check with an example.\n\nEarlier, for k=3, which is a divisor of 2004 (since 2004 ÷ 3 = 668). So that works. Similarly, k=2: 2004 ÷ 2=1002. So m=1002, so term number n = m + 1 = 1003. So 1 + 1002*2 = 1 + 2004 = 2005. Correct. Similarly, k=4? Wait, 4 divides 2004? Let me check 2004 ÷ 4 = 501. Yes, because 4*500=2000, plus 4*1=4, so 4*501=2004. Therefore, k=4 is also a divisor, so 2005 is in S_4. Let me check: first term 1, then 1 + 4*(m) = 2005 ⇒ 4m=2004 ⇒ m=501. So term number 502. So yes, it's there.\n\nBut let me check if there is a problem with k=1. For k=1, the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4,..., so 2005 is definitely in there. Let me check according to the equation. m*k=2004 ⇒ m=2004. Therefore, term number m + 1 = 2005. Which is correct. Therefore, k=1 is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, k=2004. As I checked before, the sequence is 1, 2005,... So term 2 is 2005. So yes, works.\n\nTherefore, all divisors of 2004, which are 12 in total, would correspond to valid k's. Therefore, the answer is 12? But let me check if I made a mistake in the prime factorization.\n\nLet me recompute the prime factors of 2004.\n\n2004 divided by 2 is 1002.\n\nDivided by 2 again is 501.\n\nThen 501 divided by 3 is 167. Then 167 is prime. So yes, 2^2 * 3 * 167. Therefore, exponents 2,1,1. So number of divisors is (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3*2*2=12. Therefore, 12 divisors.\n\nBut let me list them to make sure. Let me list all divisors of 2004.\n\nStart with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 167, 2*167=334, 3*167=501, 4*167=668, 6*167=1002, 12*167=2004. Let me count them:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 167, 334, 501, 668, 1002, 2004. That's 12 divisors. Yep. So 12 values of k. Therefore, the answer is 12. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{12}?\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"For each positive integer k, let S_k denote the increasing arithmetic sequence of integers whose first term is 1 and whose common difference is k.\" So the sequences are of integers. So all terms are integers, which they are, since starting at 1 and adding integer differences. So no problem there.\n\nBut let me check if there's a possibility of overcounting? For example, could different k's lead to the same sequence? No, because each sequence is determined uniquely by its common difference k. Since k is different, the sequences are different. But the question is not about sequences, but about how many k's have 2005 in their sequence. Since each divisor gives a unique k, and each k corresponds to exactly one sequence, and each such k will include 2005 in its sequence. Therefore, 12 seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a case where m*k = 2004, but k is allowed to be something else? For example, suppose k is not a divisor of 2004. Then m would not be integer, so 2005 would not be in the sequence. Therefore, only divisors. Therefore, number of divisors is 12. Therefore, answer is 12. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another example. Suppose k= something like 6. Let's check if 2005 is in S_6. The sequence is 1, 7, 13, 19,... So general term is 1 + 6m. So 1 + 6m = 2005 ⇒ 6m = 2004 ⇒ m = 334. Which is integer. And 6 is a divisor of 2004 (since 2004 ÷ 6 = 334). So yes, works. Similarly, k=167: the sequence is 1, 168, 335,... So term is 1 + 167m. So 1 + 167m = 2005 ⇒ 167m = 2004 ⇒ m=2004 / 167 = 12. Which is integer. So term 13. Correct. So works. Similarly, k= 334: 1 + 334m = 2005 ⇒ 334m = 2004 ⇒ m= 2004 / 334 = 6. So term 7. Correct. So yes, works. Therefore, all divisors work. Therefore, answer is 12. Therefore, I think the answer is 12.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a mistake in considering m ≥ 1. For example, if m = 2004 / k must be ≥ 1? Which would mean that k ≤ 2004. But since k is a positive divisor of 2004, the divisors range from 1 up to 2004. Therefore, m ranges from 2004 down to 1. Therefore, all divisors are allowed. Therefore, 12 is correct. Therefore, the answer is 12. Therefore, I think the answer is \\boxed{12}.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, let me check another thing. Suppose k is such that the term 2005 is actually the first term? Wait, the first term is 1. So 2005 can't be the first term. Therefore, m must be at least 1, so that term is 1 + k*1 = 1 + k. Therefore, 1 + k ≤ 2005. Which would mean that k ≤ 2004. Which is already satisfied because k is a divisor of 2004, which is at most 2004. Therefore, all divisors are allowed. Therefore, no problem. Therefore, 12 is correct.\n\nBut let me check for k=2004. Then the term is 1 + 2004*1 = 2005. So that is the second term. Therefore, yes. So m=1. So that's okay. Therefore, all divisors are okay. Therefore, 12 is correct. Therefore, I think that is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if 2005 can be achieved with different k's? For example, suppose there are multiple ways? But no, because each k corresponds to a unique way. Since k must divide 2004, each divisor gives exactly one k. Therefore, the total number is the number of divisors. Therefore, 12. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the answer is 12. Therefore, \\boxed{12} is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>"}
