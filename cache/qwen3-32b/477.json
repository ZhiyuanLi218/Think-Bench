UV Absorbance and Molecular Conformation**\n\nThe **UV absorbance** of a molecule is determined by the **energy gap** between the **highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)** and the **lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)**. A **larger energy gap** corresponds to **shorter wavelength** absorption, and a **smaller energy gap** corresponds to **longer wavelength** absorption.\n\n1,3-Butadiene can adopt two main conformations:\n- **s-cis conformation**: The double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond, resulting in a **bent** or **non-linear** structure.\n- **s-trans conformation**: The double bonds are on **opposite sides**, giving a **more linear** structure.\n\nIn the **s-trans conformation**, the linear geometry allows for **better conjugation** between the π orbitals of the two double bonds. This increased conjugation **stabilizes the π orbitals**, **lowering the energy gap** between HOMO and LUMO. As a result, the **absorption wavelength is longer**.\n\nIn the **s-cis conformation**, the reduced conjugation leads to a **larger energy gap** and thus a **shorter absorption wavelength**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Energy of the Lowest Occupied π State**\n\nThe **lowest occupied π state** (which corresponds to the **HOMO**) is **lower in energy** in a more conjugated system. In the **s-trans conformation**, the improved conjugation leads to **greater stabilization** of the π orbitals, hence the **lowest occupied π state is lower in energy** compared to the s-cis conformation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Shorter wavelength UV absorbance** occurs in the **s-cis** conformation due to the **larger HOMO-LUMO gap**.\n- The **lowest occupied π state is lower in energy** in the **s-trans** conformation due to **better conjugation and orbital stabilization**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n**B: s-cis, s-trans**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about 1,3-butadiene's UV absorbance and its conformation. Let me start by recalling what I know about 1,3-butadiene and its conformations.\n\nFirst, 1,3-butadiene is a conjugated diene with four carbon atoms and alternating double bonds. The molecule can exist in different conformations, specifically the s-cis and s-trans forms. The \"s\" here stands for \"single bond,\" referring to the rotation around the central single bond between the two double bonds.\n\nIn the s-cis conformation, the two double bonds are on the same side of the single bond, making the molecule more bent. In the s-trans conformation, the double bonds are on opposite sides, leading to a more linear structure. \n\nNow, the question is about UV absorbance. UV absorbance is related to the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The wavelength of the absorbed UV light is inversely proportional to the energy gap: a smaller energy gap means a longer wavelength is absorbed, and a larger energy gap means a shorter wavelength is absorbed.\n\nSo, the question asks which conformation (s-cis or s-trans) will have a shorter wavelength UV absorbance. Shorter wavelength implies a larger energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. Therefore, I need to determine which conformation has a larger energy gap between these orbitals.\n\nI remember that in conjugated systems, the degree of conjugation and the spatial arrangement of the orbitals affect the energy levels. In the s-trans conformation, the molecule is more linear, allowing for better conjugation between the two double bonds. Better conjugation typically leads to a smaller energy gap between the π orbitals because the electrons are delocalized over a larger area. A smaller energy gap would mean longer wavelength absorption. Conversely, if the molecule is in the s-cis conformation, the bent geometry might reduce the conjugation slightly, leading to a larger energy gap and thus shorter wavelength absorption.\n\nWait, but the question also mentions the lowest occupied π state. The second part asks which conformation has the lowest occupied π state lower in energy. If the s-trans conformation has better conjugation, the π orbitals are more delocalized, which usually stabilizes (lowers the energy of) the π orbitals. So the lowest occupied π state (which is the HOMO in this case) would be lower in energy in the s-trans conformation compared to s-cis. \n\nPutting this together: \n- Shorter wavelength UV absorbance occurs when the energy gap is larger. The s-cis conformation, with less effective conjugation, would have a larger HOMO-LUMO gap, leading to shorter wavelength absorption.\n- The lowest occupied π state (HOMO) is lower in energy in the s-trans conformation because of better conjugation and stabilization.\n\nTherefore, the first blank should be s-cis (for shorter wavelength) and the second blank should be s-trans (for lower energy HOMO).\n\nLooking at the options:\nA: s-trans, s-trans\nB: s-cis, s-trans\nC: s-cis, s-cis\nD: s-trans, s-cis\n\nThe correct answer would be B: s-cis, s-trans.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If s-trans has better conjugation, the energy gap is smaller, so longer wavelength. So the shorter wavelength is in s-cis. And the lowest occupied π state is lower in energy in s-trans. Yes, that matches option B. \n\nAnother way to think: the energy of the π orbitals. In a more conjugated system (s-trans), the π electrons are spread out more, which lowers their energy. So the HOMO is lower in s-trans. The LUMO would also be lower, but the gap between HOMO and LUMO is smaller in s-trans. Therefore, the absorption (which corresponds to HOMO to LUMO transition) is at longer wavelength in s-trans. Hence, the shorter wavelength is in s-cis. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
