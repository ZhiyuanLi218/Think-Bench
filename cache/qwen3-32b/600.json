One is moving with velocity v, and the other is at rest. Both have the same mass m and charge q. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about collisions. \n\nFirst, collisions can be elastic or inelastic. Since the problem mentions charges, maybe there's an electromagnetic interaction? But wait, in typical collision problems, unless specified otherwise, we usually assume it's a perfectly elastic collision, especially if they don't mention any loss of kinetic energy. But here, since both particles have charges, maybe there's some electrostatic repulsion involved? But in a head-on collision, maybe they are treated as point particles, and the collision is instantaneous? Or is the electrostatic force considered during the collision? \n\nWait, in classical mechanics, when dealing with collisions, especially between particles like in this case, we usually assume that the collision is due to direct contact, and the electrostatic forces are neglected unless specified. But since both particles have charges, maybe the collision is actually due to their electrostatic repulsion? But then, how do we model that? Typically, in such cases, if it's a head-on collision and they are identical particles, maybe we can still use conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy, assuming it's an elastic collision. \n\nBut I need to check if the electrostatic forces would affect this. If the collision is due to electrostatic repulsion, then technically, the forces are conservative, so kinetic energy should be conserved. However, in reality, when charges accelerate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, so there might be some energy loss. But again, unless the problem specifies that, maybe we can ignore that and assume an elastic collision. \n\nGiven that the problem is likely intended for an introductory physics context, I think we can proceed with the standard elastic collision approach. Let me confirm the properties of elastic collisions between identical masses. \n\nIn an elastic collision where two objects have the same mass, and one is initially at rest, their velocities are exchanged. Wait, so if one particle is moving with velocity v and the other is at rest, after collision, the first one stops, and the second one moves with velocity v. But is that correct? Let me recall the formula. \n\nFor elastic collisions, we have two equations: conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy. \n\nLet me write them down. Let’s denote the initial velocities as u1 and u2. Here, u1 = v and u2 = 0. The final velocities will be v1 and v2. \n\nConservation of momentum: m*u1 + m*u2 = m*v1 + m*v2. Since both masses are the same, we can divide both sides by m:\n\nu1 + u2 = v1 + v2\n\nPlugging in the initial velocities:\n\nv + 0 = v1 + v2 => v = v1 + v2 ...(1)\n\nConservation of kinetic energy:\n\n(1/2)m*u1² + (1/2)m*u2² = (1/2)m*v1² + (1/2)m*v2²\n\nAgain, divide both sides by (1/2)m:\n\nu1² + u2² = v1² + v2²\n\nPlugging in the initial velocities:\n\nv² + 0 = v1² + v2² => v² = v1² + v2² ...(2)\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) v = v1 + v2\n\n2) v² = v1² + v2²\n\nLet me solve these equations. From equation 1, we can express v2 = v - v1. Substitute into equation 2:\n\nv² = v1² + (v - v1)²\n\nExpanding the square:\n\nv² = v1² + v² - 2v*v1 + v1²\n\nSimplify:\n\nv² = 2v1² - 2v*v1 + v²\n\nSubtract v² from both sides:\n\n0 = 2v1² - 2v*v1\n\nDivide both sides by 2v (assuming v ≠ 0):\n\n0 = v1² - v*v1 => v1² - v*v1 = 0 => v1(v1 - v) = 0\n\nTherefore, the solutions are v1 = 0 or v1 = v.\n\nSo if v1 = 0, then from equation 1, v2 = v. If v1 = v, then v2 = 0. \n\nBut the second solution is just the initial condition. Therefore, the physical solution is that the first particle stops, and the second one moves off with velocity v. \n\nBut wait, this is the case for elastic collisions between equal masses. So in this case, since the problem says \"head-on collision\", which usually implies elastic collision in physics problems unless stated otherwise. \n\nBut here's the catch: the problem mentions that both particles have charge q. Does that affect the collision? In real scenarios, if two charged particles collide, their interaction is via the Coulomb force, which is a repulsive force if they have the same charge. However, in classical mechanics, when we model collisions, we usually consider either perfectly elastic or inelastic collisions, and the details of the interaction forces are abstracted away. \n\nBut if the collision is due to the Coulomb force, then technically, the particles would never actually come into contact; they would repel each other. However, in some contexts, especially if they are considered to have hard-sphere interactions in addition to their charges, or if the collision is treated as a direct hit, maybe we can still use the elastic collision formulas. \n\nBut since the problem mentions that it's a head-on collision, perhaps we are to assume that it's a perfectly elastic collision, regardless of the charges? Or maybe the charges are just extra information to perhaps trick us? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the charges are relevant because during the collision, there might be some other effects. For example, if the collision is not instantaneous, the particles might exert forces on each other over time, but in standard collision problems, we assume that the collision is instantaneous and that external forces are negligible. \n\nTherefore, unless there is an external magnetic field or something else, the charges might not affect the collision dynamics here. Since both particles have the same charge, they would repel each other, but during the collision, the forces they exert on each other are internal to the system, so momentum is still conserved. Kinetic energy is also conserved if we assume that the collision is elastic. \n\nTherefore, even with charges, if it's an elastic collision, the result would be the same as if they were neutral. Therefore, the final velocities would be 0 and v. \n\nBut let me check if there is a different approach if we consider electromagnetic effects. For example, if the particles are charged, when they collide, they might radiate electromagnetic waves, leading to energy loss. However, in most basic physics courses, this is neglected unless specified. Since the problem doesn't mention anything about radiation or energy loss, I think it's safe to proceed with the elastic collision assumption. \n\nAnother thought: if the collision is perfectly elastic and the particles are identical, then swapping their velocities is the solution. Since one is at rest, the moving one stops, and the other starts moving. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the final velocity of the first particle is 0, and the second particle has velocity v. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't a different scenario. For example, if the collision is not perfectly elastic, but the problem says \"head-on collision\", which typically doesn't specify elasticity. However, in the absence of information, for problems involving particles, especially in physics exams, if they don't specify, it's often an elastic collision. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the charges are there to indicate that the collision is elastic? Because if two charged particles repel each other, their collision would be elastic since the Coulomb force is conservative. Whereas if they were neutral, maybe a collision could be inelastic. But again, unless told otherwise, we can't assume that. \n\nBut given that they are telling us about the charges, maybe there is something else? For example, if the collision is not direct, but in this case, it is a head-on collision. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in a context where electromagnetic forces are considered, but since it's a head-on collision, the motion is one-dimensional, so maybe the charges don't affect the final velocities? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the charges cause some sort of pre-collision or post-collision acceleration? But during the collision, if it's instantaneous, then maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, if the collision is due to the electrostatic repulsion, then the particles would approach each other, reach a minimum distance, then recede. However, in such a case, if it's a head-on collision, and assuming they don't lose energy, then they would just reverse their velocities. Wait, but that's similar to the elastic collision result. \n\nWait, let's think about it. Suppose two charged particles approach each other head-on. They have some initial velocities. If they repel each other, they will slow down, stop, then accelerate back. If they are identical, then in the center of mass frame, they would just reverse their directions. But converting back to the lab frame where one is initially at rest... \n\nBut maybe this is overcomplicating. Let me try solving it using the Coulomb force approach. However, without knowing the distance of closest approach or the time of interaction, it's difficult. However, if we assume that the collision is elastic, then the result is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing knowledge of both collisions and electromagnetic forces? But how? \n\nWait, if the particles are moving and have charges, they might exert magnetic forces on each other due to their motion. However, in a head-on collision, the magnetic force might be negligible compared to the electric force? Let me recall: the magnetic force is given by the Lorentz force, F = q(v × B). However, the magnetic field produced by a moving charge is given by the Biot-Savart law. \n\nBut for two particles moving directly towards each other, the magnetic field produced by one at the location of the other would be perpendicular to their velocities. For example, if particle 1 is moving to the right, then its magnetic field at the position of particle 2 (which is moving to the left) would be into or out of the page depending on the charges. But since they are moving directly towards each other, the velocity vectors are along the line connecting them, so the magnetic force would be perpendicular to the line connecting them. However, since the motion is head-on, the magnetic forces would be perpendicular to the direction of motion, meaning they might not affect the head-on collision dynamics significantly. Therefore, the dominant force is the electric repulsion, which is along the line connecting them. \n\nBut again, in a collision scenario, if we are to consider the forces, it's complicated. However, if we assume that the collision is instantaneous, then the magnetic forces can be neglected because they are much smaller than the electric forces, especially at non-relativistic speeds. \n\nTherefore, even considering charges, the collision can be treated as elastic with the same result. \n\nTherefore, the final velocities are 0 and v. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's consider the center of mass frame. \n\nThe initial velocity of the center of mass is (m*v + m*0)/(2m) = v/2. \n\nIn the center of mass frame, the initial velocities are: \n\nFor the first particle: v - v/2 = v/2 \n\nFor the second particle: 0 - v/2 = -v/2 \n\nIn an elastic collision, in the center of mass frame, the velocities reverse direction. So after collision, their velocities in the center of mass frame would be -v/2 and v/2. \n\nTransforming back to the lab frame: \n\nFirst particle: -v/2 + v/2 = 0 \n\nSecond particle: v/2 + v/2 = v \n\nSame result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the charges, as long as it's an elastic collision between equal masses, the result is the velocities are exchanged. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the first particle stops, and the second moves with velocity v. \n\nBut let me think again: the problem says \"undergoes a head-on collision\". In real life, two charged particles can't have a perfectly head-on collision because they repel each other. They would scatter at some angle. However, in the limit where they approach each other with a very small impact parameter (approaching head-on), but again, if they are point charges, theoretically, a head-on collision is possible. However, in reality, they would never actually collide because of the repulsion. \n\nBut in physics problems, when we talk about collisions between charged particles, especially in the context of elastic collisions, we might still use the same conservation laws. For example, in Rutherford scattering, the alpha particles are deflected by the nucleus due to Coulomb repulsion, but that's a different scenario where the collision is not head-on and the particles don't actually touch. However, if we are to assume a head-on collision, which implies that they do come into contact or interact in a way that allows us to use the standard collision equations, then maybe we can proceed. \n\nAlternatively, if we model the collision as a direct hit with some sort of spring-like interaction (as in some collision models), then charges wouldn't affect the outcome as long as the collision is elastic. \n\nTherefore, considering all that, I think the answer is that the first particle comes to rest, and the second moves off with velocity v. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there's any other factor. For example, if the collision is in one dimension, and the particles are identical, then yes, velocities exchange. \n\nAlternatively, if the collision is inelastic, but since they don't mention anything about that, and given that charges are mentioned, which might hint towards conservative forces, so elastic. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that the final velocities are 0 and v. \n\nBut let me write the equations again step by step to make sure I didn't skip anything. \n\nConservation of momentum:\n\nm*v + m*0 = m*v1 + m*v2 => v = v1 + v2\n\nConservation of kinetic energy:\n\n(1/2)m*v² = (1/2)m*v1² + (1/2)m*v2² => v² = v1² + v2²\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom momentum: v2 = v - v1\n\nSubstitute into energy equation:\n\nv² = v1² + (v - v1)² \n\nExpanding (v - v1)²: v² - 2v*v1 + v1² \n\nSo:\n\nv² = v1² + v² - 2v*v1 + v1² \n\nSimplify:\n\nv² = 2v1² - 2v*v1 + v² \n\nSubtract v²:\n\n0 = 2v1² - 2v*v1 \n\nDivide by 2v:\n\n0 = v1²/v - v1 \n\nMultiply by v:\n\n0 = v1² - v²*v1 ?\n\nWait, no, earlier step:\n\nDivide by 2v:\n\n0 = (2v1² - 2v*v1)/(2v) ?\n\nWait, no, earlier I said divide both sides by 2v, but actually, after subtracting v², we have 0 = 2v1² - 2v*v1. \n\nFactor out 2v1:\n\n0 = 2v1(v1 - v) => v1 = 0 or v1 = v. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, solutions are v1 = 0, v2 = v or v1 = v, v2 = 0. The latter is the initial condition, so the former is the solution. \n\nTherefore, the final velocities are 0 and v. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be: the first particle comes to rest, and the second moves with velocity v. \n\nBut let me check if there is a case where the charges might cause a different result. For example, if the collision is not perfectly elastic because of electromagnetic radiation? \n\nIn reality, accelerating charges emit electromagnetic radiation, which carries away energy. Therefore, in reality, the collision would not be perfectly elastic. However, in most physics problems at the introductory level, unless specified, we neglect such energy losses. Since the problem does not mention anything about energy loss or radiation, we can assume that kinetic energy is conserved. \n\nTherefore, sticking with the elastic collision result is appropriate here. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that the final velocities are 0 and v. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final velocities of the two particles are \\boxed{0} and \\boxed{v}.\n</think>"}
