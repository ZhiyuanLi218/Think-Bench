Under **high temperature and pressure**, $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$ can undergo structural transformation into an **amorphous carbon glass**. This transformation does not involve the formation of a new element but rather a **rearrangement of the carbon atoms into a different structural form**.\n\nAmorphous carbon glass is a **non-crystalline**, **glassy form of carbon** that lacks the long-range order seen in crystalline forms like diamond or graphite. It is known to have **some conductivity** and **high hardness**, suggesting it may have a significant amount of **sp³ hybridized carbon atoms**.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n- **(A) It has self-appearance**  \n  This phrase is ambiguous and likely a mistranslation. However, if interpreted as implying **amorphousness** or **isotropic properties** (which are common in glasses), this statement is **plausible** and **correct** for amorphous carbon glass.\n\n- **(B) It is an allotrope of $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$**  \n  This is **incorrect**. **Allotropes** are different structural forms of the **same element**, not of a specific compound. Since $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$ is a **compound** (a molecular form of carbon), carbon glass cannot be considered an allotrope of $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$. Instead, both are **allotropes of carbon**. This is a misuse of the term and is therefore **incorrect**.\n\n- **(C) It contains $\\mathrm{sp}^3$ hybridized carbon atoms**  \n  Given that carbon glass is **hard and has some conductivity**, it is likely to have a significant number of **$\\mathrm{sp}^3$ hybridized carbon atoms**, similar to diamond. This statement is **correct**.\n\n- **(D) Its chemical properties differ from those of diamond**  \n  While the **physical** properties of carbon glass and diamond differ significantly (e.g., structure, hardness, optical properties), their **chemical properties** are generally similar under normal conditions because both are composed entirely of carbon. However, under **extreme conditions**, such as high temperatures, **amorphous carbon** may be more reactive than diamond. So, while the chemical properties are mostly similar, there **can be differences**, making this statement **plausible** and **not incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAmong the given statements, the **incorrect** one is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about carbon glass formed from C60 under high temperature and pressure. The options are about which statement is incorrect regarding this carbon glass.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about C60 and its transformations. C60 is a fullerene, which is a form of carbon with a spherical structure, like a soccer ball. Under high pressure and temperature, it can transform into other forms of carbon. The question mentions amorphous carbon glass. Amorphous usually means it lacks a long-range order, unlike crystalline structures like diamond or graphite.\n\nNow, the options:\n\nA) It has self-appearance. Hmm, not sure what \"self-appearance\" means. Maybe it's a translation issue. In Chinese, sometimes terms get translated awkwardly. Maybe they mean \"isotropic\" or \"has a glassy appearance\"? If \"self-appearance\" is supposed to refer to being amorphous, then amorphous materials are isotropic, so that might be correct. But I need to check other options first.\n\nB) It is an allotrope of C60. Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element. So if carbon glass is another form of carbon, and since C60 is also carbon, then maybe B is correct? Or is it not considered an allotrope of C60 but rather an allotrope of carbon in general? Wait, all allotropes of carbon are different structures, like diamond, graphite, fullerene (C60), graphene, etc. So if carbon glass is another amorphous form, then it's an allotrope of carbon, but not an allotrope of C60. Because C60 is an allotrope of carbon, so carbon glass is another allotrope. So B says \"it is an allotrope of C60\" which is incorrect. Because allotropes are different forms of the same element, not of a specific compound. So B is incorrect. Wait, but maybe the question is using the term differently? Let me think again. If C60 transforms into carbon glass, then perhaps they are considered different forms of the same element. So C60 is a molecular form, and carbon glass is another. So technically, carbon glass is an allotrope of carbon, not of C60. Therefore, statement B is incorrect. That might be the answer.\n\nC) It contains sp³ hybridized carbon atoms. Since it's a hard material with some conductivity, maybe it has a mix of hybridizations. Diamond is sp³, graphite is sp². If it's a glass, maybe it's a mix, but if it's hard, maybe more sp³. So C could be correct. So if it's amorphous but hard, maybe it has a lot of sp³ bonds. So C is correct. Therefore, the statement is correct, so not the incorrect one.\n\nD) Its chemical properties differ from those of diamond. Well, diamond is a crystalline form of carbon. Carbon glass is amorphous. Chemical properties might be similar if they are both carbon, but physical properties differ. However, chemical properties like reactivity might be similar under normal conditions. But maybe under certain conditions, but the question says \"differ\". Hmm. If they have different structures, maybe their chemical properties are different? For example, diamond is stable under high temperature, but amorphous carbon might oxidize more easily. But the question is about whether D is incorrect. If the chemical properties are similar, then D is incorrect. But if they differ, then D is correct. The question is asking which is incorrect. So if the answer is D, then that would mean the chemical properties don't differ, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Allotropes can have different chemical reactivities. For example, diamond is less reactive than graphite in some cases. So if carbon glass is amorphous, maybe it's more reactive than diamond. So D would be correct. Therefore, D is a correct statement, so not the incorrect one.\n\nSo the incorrect statement is B. Because carbon glass is an allotrope of carbon, not an allotrope of C60. Allotropes are different forms of the same element. C60 is an allotrope of carbon, and carbon glass is another. So B is incorrect. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
