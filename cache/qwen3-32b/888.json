Let me start by recalling what I know about muons and their lifetimes. \n\nThe problem says that a muon is created in a laboratory and travels 1000 meters before disintegrating. The average lifetime of a muon is 2 × 10⁻⁶ seconds. The question is asking for the speed of the muon as observed by the researcher in the lab, assuming the muon lives exactly its average lifetime. The answer choices are given, so I need to calculate the correct one.\n\nFirst, let me think about classical physics. If there were no relativistic effects, the speed would just be distance divided by time. So, if the muon lives for 2 × 10⁻⁶ seconds and travels 1000 meters, then speed v = distance / time = 1000 m / (2 × 10⁻⁶ s) = 5 × 10⁸ m/s. Wait, but the speed of light is approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s, so 5 × 10⁸ m/s is faster than light. That can't be possible. So, clearly, relativistic effects must be involved here.\n\nAh, right! Because muons are created in the upper atmosphere and travel to the Earth's surface, their extended lifetime due to time dilation is a classic example of special relativity. So, in this problem, the muon's lifetime is given in its own rest frame, but the researcher in the lab is observing it moving at a high speed, so time dilation must be taken into account.\n\nLet me recall the time dilation formula from special relativity. The proper time τ (the muon's lifetime in its rest frame) is related to the lab time t by t = γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). \n\nIn the lab frame, the time between the creation and disintegration of the muon is longer due to time dilation. Therefore, the distance the muon travels in the lab frame is v * t = v * γτ. \n\nSo according to the problem, the researcher observes the muon to travel 1000 meters, so:\n\ndistance = v * γ * τ\n\nTherefore, 1000 m = v * γ * (2 × 10⁻⁶ s)\n\nBut γ is a function of v, so we need to solve for v in this equation. Let me write that equation again:\n\n1000 = v * γ * 2e-6\n\nLet me substitute γ:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nSo:\n\n1000 = v * [1 / √(1 - v²/c²)] * 2e-6\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nv / √(1 - v²/c²) = 1000 / (2e-6) = 5e8 m/s\n\nSo:\n\nv / √(1 - v²/c²) = 5e8 m/s\n\nBut the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Let me denote c = 3e8 m/s for calculation purposes.\n\nSo, let me write this equation in terms of β, where β = v/c. Then, v = βc.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nβc / √(1 - β²) = 5e8\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\nβc / √(1 - β²) = βc / √(1 - β²) = c * β / √(1 - β²)\n\nSo:\n\nc * β / √(1 - β²) = 5e8\n\nBut c is 3e8 m/s, so:\n\n(3e8) * [β / √(1 - β²)] = 5e8\n\nDivide both sides by 3e8:\n\nβ / √(1 - β²) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(β²) / (1 - β²) = (25/9)\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - β²):\n\nβ² = (25/9)(1 - β²)\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\nβ² = (25/9) - (25/9)β²\n\nBring all terms with β² to the left:\n\nβ² + (25/9)β² = 25/9\n\nFactor out β²:\n\nβ² [1 + 25/9] = 25/9\n\nCompute 1 + 25/9 = 9/9 + 25/9 = 34/9\n\nTherefore:\n\nβ² * (34/9) = 25/9\n\nMultiply both sides by 9/34:\n\nβ² = (25/9) * (9/34) = 25/34\n\nTherefore:\n\nβ = √(25/34) = 5 / √34 ≈ 5 / 5.8309 ≈ 0.8575\n\nSo β ≈ 0.8575, meaning v ≈ 0.8575 * c ≈ 0.8575 * 3e8 ≈ 2.5725e8 m/s ≈ 257,250,000 m/s\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA: 278,394,987 m/s  \nB: 257,247,878 m/s  \nC: 500,000,000 m/s  \nD: 290,141,565 m/s  \n\nSo answer B is approximately 257 million m/s, which matches our calculation. Let me check my steps again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the lab frame sees the muon's lifetime extended due to time dilation. The distance traveled is v multiplied by the dilated time. So:\n\ndistance = v * γτ\n\nWhich gives the equation:\n\nv * γτ = 1000 m\n\nThen solving for v. Then substituting γ and solving for β. The algebra steps seem correct. Let me verify the calculation of β.\n\nβ² = 25/34. Let me compute 25 divided by 34. 25/34 ≈ 0.7353. Then square root of that is sqrt(0.7353) ≈ 0.8575. Correct. Then multiplying by c: 0.8575 * 3e8 ≈ 2.5725e8 m/s, which is 257,250,000 m/s. Answer B is 257,247,878 m/s, which is very close. The slight difference is probably due to rounding during the calculation. For example, if I use a more precise value of c, or carry more decimal places in β.\n\nLet me check with more precise numbers. Let's recast the equations.\n\nFirst, let's compute β exactly:\n\nβ² = 25/34\n\nTherefore β = 5 / sqrt(34)\n\nCompute sqrt(34):\n\nsqrt(34) ≈ 5.8309518948\n\nSo β ≈ 5 / 5.8309518948 ≈ 0.857492925\n\nThen v ≈ 0.857492925 * c\n\nIf c is exactly 299,792,458 m/s, then:\n\nv ≈ 0.857492925 * 299,792,458 ≈ Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 0.8 * 299,792,458 = 239,833,966.4\n\n0.05 * 299,792,458 = 14,989,622.9\n\n0.007492925 * 299,792,458 ≈ Let me compute 0.007 * 299,792,458 ≈ 2,098,547.2 and 0.000492925 * 299,792,458 ≈ approx 0.000492925 * 3e8 ≈ 147,877.5 m/s. So adding up:\n\n239,833,966.4 + 14,989,622.9 ≈ 254,823,589.3 + approx 2,098,547.2 + 147,877.5 ≈ 254,823,589.3 + 2,246,424.7 ≈ 257,069, 014 m/s.\n\nBut answer B is 257,247,878 m/s. Hmm. There's a slight difference here. Maybe I approximated too much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using c = 3.00 × 10^8 m/s for simplicity?\n\nLet me recalculate with c = 3.00 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nv = β * c = (5 / sqrt(34)) * 3.00e8\n\nCompute 5 / sqrt(34):\n\nsqrt(34) ≈ 5.83095\n\n5 / 5.83095 ≈ 0.857493\n\nMultiply by 3.00e8:\n\n0.857493 * 3.00e8 ≈ 2.572479e8 m/s, which is 257,247,900 m/s. That's extremely close to answer B: 257,247,878 m/s. The difference is due to more precise calculation of sqrt(34) or perhaps more decimal places in the multiplication. Therefore, answer B is correct.\n\nLet me check if there is another approach where maybe length contraction is involved? Wait, in the muon's rest frame, the distance it travels would be contracted. But the problem says that the researcher observes the muon to travel 1000 m. So the lab frame is the one where the distance is measured as 1000 m. Therefore, the proper lifetime is in the muon's rest frame. So the approach using time dilation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the muon's rest frame, the lab is moving, and the distance would be length contracted. But since we are given the lab frame distance, it's easier to stick with time dilation.\n\nAnother check: if the muon's speed was 0.857c, then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.857²). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, β = 0.857, so β² ≈ 0.734. Then 1 - β² ≈ 0.266. sqrt(0.266) ≈ 0.5157. Therefore gamma ≈ 1 / 0.5157 ≈ 1.94. \n\nThen the time in the lab frame would be gamma * tau ≈ 1.94 * 2e-6 ≈ 3.88e-6 seconds. Then distance is v * t ≈ 0.857 * 3e8 * 3.88e-6 ≈ Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 0.857 * 3e8 ≈ 2.57e8 m/s. Then multiply by 3.88e-6 s:\n\n2.57e8 * 3.88e-6 ≈ 2.57 * 3.88 * 1e2 ≈ 9.98 * 100 ≈ 998 m. Close to 1000 m. The slight discrepancy is due to approximate values of beta and gamma. If we use exact numbers, it should give exactly 1000 m. Therefore, this confirms that the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B:257247878 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
