Let me start by recalling the problem statement. The electric field is vertical and has a magnitude of 10^4 V/m. The raindrop has a radius of 1 mm and isn't falling, which suggests that the electric force is balancing the gravitational force. The question is asking for the minimum charge on the raindrop. The options are given, so I need to calculate the charge and see which option it matches.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given quantities:\n\n- Electric field, E = 10^4 V/m (vertical direction)\n- Radius of raindrop, r = 1 mm = 0.001 m\n- Gravitational acceleration, g = 10 m/s²\n- Density of water, ρ = 10³ kg/m³\n\nSince the raindrop isn't falling, the electric force must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the gravitational force. So, I can write:\n\nElectric force (F_e) = Gravitational force (F_g)\n\nThe electric force on a charge in an electric field is given by F_e = q * E, where q is the charge. The gravitational force is F_g = m * g, where m is the mass of the raindrop. Therefore, setting them equal:\n\nq * E = m * g\n\nSo, solving for q gives:\n\nq = (m * g) / E\n\nTherefore, I need to find the mass of the raindrop. Since the raindrop is a sphere, its volume is (4/3)πr³. Then, mass m = volume * density.\n\nLet me compute the volume first. The radius r is 1 mm, which is 0.001 m. So,\n\nVolume V = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π*(0.001 m)³\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, (0.001)^3 = 1e-9 m³.\n\nMultiply by 4/3 π:\n\nV ≈ (4/3) * 3.1416 * 1e-9 ≈ 4.1888 * 1e-9 ≈ 4.1888e-9 m³.\n\nThen, mass m = density * volume. The density of water is 10³ kg/m³, so:\n\nm = 10³ kg/m³ * 4.1888e-9 m³ ≈ 4.1888e-6 kg.\n\nWait, 10³ kg/m³ * 4.1888e-9 m³ = 4.1888e-6 kg. Let me check the exponents:\n\n10³ * 1e-9 = 1e-6, multiplied by 4.1888 gives 4.1888e-6 kg. Correct.\n\nSo m ≈ 4.1888e-6 kg.\n\nNow, compute F_g = m * g = 4.1888e-6 kg * 10 m/s² = 4.1888e-5 N.\n\nThen, the electric force F_e must equal this. Since F_e = q * E, so q = F_e / E = (4.1888e-5 N) / (1e4 V/m).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n4.1888e-5 / 1e4 = 4.1888e-9 C.\n\nSo approximately 4.1888 × 10^-9 C. Looking at the options, option B is 4 × 10^-9 C. That seems to be the answer. But let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the direction of the electric field and the charge: The problem says the electric field is vertical. Since the raindrop is not falling, the electric force must be upward. Assuming that the electric field is directed downward or upward? Wait, thunderclouds typically have electric fields directed downward or upward? Well, actually, the direction of the electric field depends on the charge distribution in the cloud. However, since the problem states that the electric field is vertical and the raindrop is not falling, we can assume that the electric force is upward to balance gravity. Therefore, if the electric field is upward, then a positive charge would experience an upward force. If the electric field is downward, then a negative charge would experience an upward force. However, the problem doesn't specify the direction of the electric field, just that it's vertical. However, since we are to find the minimum charge, regardless of sign, the magnitude is what's important here. Therefore, the calculation of the magnitude of the charge is correct.\n\nSo the calculation gives approximately 4.1888 × 10^-9 C. The closest option is B) 4 × 10^-9 C. The options are approximate, so this seems correct.\n\nBut let me check my calculation again for possible errors. Let me recompute the volume:\n\nRadius r = 1 mm = 0.001 m.\n\nVolume V = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π*(1e-3)^3 = (4/3)π*1e-9 ≈ 4.1888e-9 m³. Correct.\n\nDensity of water is 1000 kg/m³, so mass m = 1000 * 4.1888e-9 ≈ 4.1888e-6 kg. Correct.\n\nThen, gravitational force F_g = m * g = 4.1888e-6 kg * 10 m/s² = 4.1888e-5 N. Correct.\n\nElectric field E = 1e4 V/m. Then charge q = F_g / E = 4.1888e-5 / 1e4 = 4.1888e-9 C ≈ 4.19 × 10^-9 C. Which is approximately 4 × 10^-9 C. So option B.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to consider the sign or some other factor? The problem says \"minimum amount of charge\". Is there a possibility that the charge could be less if there is another consideration? For example, if the electric field is such that the charge needs to be of a certain sign. But no, the minimum charge would be when the electric force exactly balances gravity. So the calculation seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in unit conversions? Let me check.\n\nElectric field is in V/m. 1 V/m is equivalent to 1 N/C. Therefore, E is in N/C. Therefore, q = F/E is in (N)/(N/C) = C. So the units are correct.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using a different value for pi? For example, if they approximate pi as 3, then let me check:\n\nVolume with pi ≈ 3: V ≈ (4/3)*3*(1e-3)^3 = 4*(1e-9) = 4e-9 m³. Then mass m = 1000 * 4e-9 = 4e-6 kg. Then F_g = 4e-6 * 10 = 4e-5 N. Then q = 4e-5 / 1e4 = 4e-9 C. Exactly option B. So if the problem expects using pi ≈ 3, then the answer is exactly 4 × 10^-9 C. So that's probably why option B is the correct answer. So even if I used a more precise value of pi, like 3.14, the answer is still approximately 4.19 × 10^-9 C, which is closest to 4 × 10^-9 C. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
