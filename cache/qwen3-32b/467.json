Hmm, resonance structures occur when there are multiple ways to draw the Lewis structure with the same arrangement of atoms but different distributions of electrons. Right, so molecules that have delocalized electrons or multiple bonds that can be in different positions usually have resonance.\n\nLet me start by recalling each molecule's structure.\n\nFirst, CO2. Carbon dioxide. Carbon is the central atom with double bonds to each oxygen. So O=C=O. Wait, but is there resonance here? Let me think. If I try to draw another structure, maybe moving the double bonds, but there are only two oxygens. If I put a single bond on one side and a triple bond on the other, would that work? Let me check the formal charges. Carbon usually forms four bonds. If I have a triple bond to one oxygen and a single bond to another, the formal charges would be: for the triple-bonded oxygen, it would have 6 valence electrons (oxygen has 6), minus (non-bonding electrons + bonds). Let me calculate. The triple bond has 3 bonds, so that's 3*2=6 bonding electrons. But wait, in formal charge, it's valence electrons minus (non-bonding electrons + ½ bonding electrons). So for triple-bonded oxygen: 6 - (non-bonding electrons + ½ * 6). If it's triple bonded, then there are two bonding pairs (since triple bond is three pairs?), wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me recall the formula again. Formal charge = Valence electrons - (number of non-bonding electrons + ½ number of bonding electrons). \n\nSo for the triple bond case: Let's say carbon is triple bonded to one oxygen and single bonded to another. The triple bond would have 6 bonding electrons (since each bond is 2 electrons). The single bond has 2 bonding electrons. So for the triple-bonded oxygen: it has 6 - [non-bonding electrons + ½ * 6]. If it's triple bonded, how many non-bonding electrons? Oxygen usually has 6 valence electrons. In a triple bond, carbon is sharing three pairs with oxygen. So oxygen would have one lone pair (2 electrons) and the triple bond. Wait, triple bond is three bonds, so that's three pairs. So oxygen has two lone pairs? Wait, no. Let me think. Carbon has four valence electrons. In CO2, normally each oxygen has double bonds. Carbon has double bonds to both oxygens, so each oxygen has two lone pairs (since double bond is two pairs, and oxygen has 6 valence electrons: 2 in bond, 4 as lone pairs). If I make a triple bond on one side, carbon would have three bonds to one oxygen and one bond to the other. Carbon's valence would be 4, so that's okay. The triple-bonded oxygen would have three bonds (each bond is a pair) and one lone pair? Wait, oxygen has 6 valence electrons. If it's triple bonded to carbon (three bonding pairs), then the remaining electrons would be 6 - 3*2 = 0? No, wait. Wait, bonding electrons are shared. Let me use the formal charge formula properly.\n\nFormal charge for triple-bonded oxygen: Valence electrons = 6. Number of non-bonding electrons: Let's say it has one lone pair (2 electrons) and triple bond (three bonding pairs). Wait, triple bond is three bonding pairs (each bond is one pair). So total bonding electrons for oxygen would be 3*2 = 6? Wait, no, the bonding electrons are counted as each bond is two electrons. So the triple bond has six bonding electrons, but in formal charge, it's ½ * bonding electrons. So for oxygen: formal charge = 6 - [non-bonding electrons + ½ * bonding electrons]. If it's triple bonded, bonding electrons are 6 (from the triple bond). Non-bonding electrons would be 6 - (bonding electrons from the bond). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me take an example. In normal CO2, each oxygen has double bonds (two bonds), so bonding electrons per oxygen is 4 (since each double bond is two bonds, each bond is two electrons). Wait, no. Wait, in a double bond, there are two bonding pairs. So for each oxygen in CO2: bonding electrons are 4 (since double bond is two pairs, each pair is two electrons, so 2 pairs * 2 electrons = 4 electrons). Non-bonding electrons would be 6 - 4 (bonding electrons) = 2? Wait, no. Wait, oxygen has 6 valence electrons. In the Lewis structure, each oxygen has two double bonds (to carbon) and two lone pairs. Wait, no. Carbon is double bonded to each oxygen. So each oxygen has a double bond (two bonding pairs) and two lone pairs (four electrons). So non-bonding electrons are 4. Then formal charge is 6 - (4 + ½ * 4) = 6 - (4 + 2) = 0. That makes sense because in CO2, each oxygen has a formal charge of zero, and carbon also has zero. \n\nNow, if I try to make a triple bond on one side. Let's say carbon is triple bonded to one oxygen and single bonded to the other. For the triple-bonded oxygen: bonding electrons are 6 (triple bond). Non-bonding electrons would be... Let's see, oxygen has 6 valence electrons. If it's triple bonded to carbon (three bonding pairs), then it has one lone pair (two electrons). So non-bonding electrons = 2. Then formal charge is 6 - (2 + ½ * 6) = 6 - (2 + 3) = 1. So formal charge of +1. For the single-bonded oxygen: bonding electrons is 2 (single bond). Non-bonding electrons would be 6 - 2 = 4? Wait, no. Non-bonding electrons are the lone pairs. If it's single bonded, it has three lone pairs (six electrons) and one bond. Wait, no. Let me calculate. The single-bonded oxygen has a single bond (one bonding pair) and three lone pairs (six electrons). So formal charge is 6 - (6 + ½ * 2) = 6 - (6 + 1) = -1. Carbon's formal charge would be: Valence electrons is 4. Bonding electrons: triple bond (3 pairs) and single bond (1 pair) total of 4 pairs. So bonding electrons is 8 (since each pair is two electrons). Wait, but in formal charge, it's ½ * bonding electrons. So for carbon: formal charge = 4 - [non-bonding electrons + ½ * bonding electrons]. Carbon has no lone pairs here, so non-bonding electrons = 0. Bonding electrons are 8 (from the triple and single bonds). So formal charge is 4 - (0 + ½ * 8) = 4 - 4 = 0. \n\nSo the structure with a triple bond and single bond gives one oxygen with +1, another with -1, and carbon with 0. But the original structure with two double bonds has all formal charges zero. So the triple/single bond structure is less favorable because of the higher formal charges. So does that mean CO2 doesn't have resonance? Wait, but maybe there's another way? Wait, if you try to draw resonance structures, you can't really move the double bonds because there are only two oxygens. If you try to switch which oxygen has the double bond, but there's only two, so it's the same structure. So in reality, CO2 doesn't have resonance structures because there's no way to rearrange the double bonds. So CO2 is a linear molecule with two double bonds, no resonance. Therefore, CO2 is not represented by multiple resonance structures.\n\nNow moving on to CO3^2-. Carbonate ion. Carbon is the central atom with three oxygens. The Lewis structure has a double bond to one oxygen and single bonds to the other two. But because of the negative charge, there's resonance. Let me recall. The carbonate ion has three resonance structures where the double bond can be on any of the three oxygens. Each oxygen can have the double bond in turn, leading to three equivalent resonance structures. So yes, CO3^2- definitely has multiple resonance structures.\n\nNext is NO2^-. Nitrite ion. Nitrogen is the central atom with two oxygens. The Lewis structure for NO2^- typically has a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond to the other, with a lone pair on nitrogen. But due to the negative charge and the possibility of resonance, there are two resonance structures where the double bond can be on either oxygen. So NO2^- has two resonance structures. Wait, let me check. Nitrogen has five valence electrons. In NO2^-, the total valence electrons are 5 (N) + 2*6 (O) + 1 (charge) = 5 + 12 + 1 = 18 electrons. The Lewis structure would have nitrogen with a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond to the other, plus a lone pair on nitrogen. But then there's a need for resonance because the double bond can be on either oxygen. So yes, two resonance structures. So NO2^- has resonance.\n\nThen NO3^-. Nitrate ion. Similar to carbonate. Nitrogen is central with three oxygens. The Lewis structure has a double bond to one oxygen and single bonds to the others, but with three oxygens, there are three resonance structures. Each oxygen can have the double bond, leading to three equivalent resonance structures. So NO3^- definitely has multiple resonance structures.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nCO2: No resonance. Only one structure.\n\nCO3^2-: Yes, three resonance structures.\n\nNO2^-: Yes, two resonance structures.\n\nNO3^-: Yes, three resonance structures.\n\nSo the answer would be which option includes CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-? Let me check the options.\n\nOption D says CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-.\n\nOption C says CO3^2- and NO3^-.\n\nOption B says NO2^- and NO3^-.\n\nOption A says CO2 and CO3^2-.\n\nBut according to my analysis, CO2 doesn't have resonance, so A is out. The correct answer should include CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^- which is option D. Let me check again.\n\nWait, but wait, is NO2^- considered to have resonance? Let me confirm. In NO2^-, the structure is bent, with a double bond and a single bond, but the double bond can be on either oxygen, hence two resonance structures. Yes, that's correct. So option D includes all three: CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-.\n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA: CO2 and CO3^2-\n\nB: NO2^- and NO3^-\n\nC: CO3^2- and NO3^-\n\nD: CO3^2-, NO2^- and NO3^-\n\nSo D is the one that includes all three. However, I need to check if all three are correct. CO3^2- yes, NO2^- yes, NO3^- yes. So D is correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with NO2^-. Let me think again. The nitrite ion has two oxygen atoms. The Lewis structure for NO2^- has nitrogen with a lone pair, and each oxygen can have the double bond. So yes, two resonance structures. Therefore, it's correct. So the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, some sources might say that NO2^- has resonance, but others might not consider it as \"multiple resonance structures\" if they consider the two structures as just two. But the question says \"multiple resonance structures,\" which usually means more than one. So two is multiple. So yes, D is correct.\n</think>"}
