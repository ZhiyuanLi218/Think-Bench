The question is about an astronomer wanting to study the H_alpha emission profile in an active galaxy. She has data for four galaxies with distances of approximately 1 Mpc, 7 Mpc, 70 Mpc, and 700 Mpc. The question is which one she should choose, and the options are A to D corresponding to those distances.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what factors affect the study of emission lines like H_alpha. H_alpha is a spectral line in the visible spectrum, specifically around 6563 Angstroms. Since the data is in the \"i\" Sloan band, I should check where that band is. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has five bands: u, g, r, i, z. The i band is centered around about 7480 Angstroms. So H_alpha at 6563 Angstroms is actually in the red part of the spectrum, which is near the i band but might be towards the edge. But maybe the redshift of the galaxy would shift H_alpha into the i band? Wait, the question says the spectral coverage is \"coincident with the 'i' Sloan band,\" so maybe the galaxy's redshifted H_alpha is within the i band's wavelength range. But the question is about which galaxy to choose based on distance.\n\nThe main thing here is probably angular resolution and surface brightness. The closer the galaxy, the larger its angular size, which means the emission lines can be studied with better spatial resolution. Also, the surface brightness (brightness per unit area) is higher for closer objects, making it easier to detect the emission. However, if the galaxy is too close, maybe there are other issues like crowding from nearby objects or the galaxy being too large for the instrument's field of view. But generally, for studying detailed features like emission line profiles, you want the galaxy to be close enough that you can resolve the structure but not so close that other factors become problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the strength of the emission line. H_alpha emission in active galaxies is due to processes like star formation or an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The strength of the emission line would depend on the intrinsic luminosity of the source and the distance. The flux received from the galaxy is proportional to the luminosity divided by the square of the distance. So if the galaxy is farther away, the flux is lower. However, if the galaxy has a more powerful AGN or more star formation, the intrinsic luminosity would be higher. But the question doesn't give information about the luminosities of the galaxies, only their distances. So assuming that the galaxies have similar intrinsic H_alpha luminosities, the one that's closer would have a higher flux. But the question is about studying the profile, which might require a good signal-to-noise ratio. So again, closer galaxies would be better for that.\n\nBut there's another factor: the redshift. For very distant galaxies, the redshift would shift the H_alpha line to longer wavelengths. If the galaxy is at 700 Mpc, the redshift would be significant. Let's calculate approximate redshifts. Using Hubble's law, v = H0 * d. Let's take H0 as approximately 70 km/s/Mpc (though the exact value can vary). So for 700 Mpc, the velocity is 70 * 700 = 49,000 km/s. The redshift z is v/c, so 49,000 / 300,000 ≈ 0.163. The rest wavelength of H_alpha is 6563 Angstroms. The observed wavelength would be 6563*(1 + z) ≈ 6563 * 1.163 ≈ 7630 Angstroms. The i band is around 7480 Angstroms. So at 700 Mpc, the H_alpha line would be shifted to ~7630, which is beyond the i band's coverage. Therefore, the H_alpha line would not be in the i band anymore. Hence, that galaxy is too far for the H_alpha line to be in the i band. The question mentions that the spectral coverage is coincident with the i band, so maybe the H_alpha line is within the i band's wavelength range. For the H_alpha line to be in the i band, the redshift must not shift it out. Let's check for each distance.\n\nFor 1 Mpc: v = 70 * 1 = 70 km/s. z ≈ 70/300,000 ≈ 0.00023. The observed wavelength is 6563 * (1 + 0.00023) ≈ 6563 + 1.5 ≈ 6564.5 Angstroms. The i band is around 7480, so H_alpha is still in the blue part of the i band? Wait, the i band is 7480, so H_alpha is at 6563, which is in the red part of the optical spectrum. The i band is in the near-infrared, so maybe H_alpha is at the blue end of the i band. But if the galaxy is at 1 Mpc, the redshift is negligible, so the H_alpha line is at 6563, which is within the i band. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut for 700 Mpc, as calculated earlier, the H_alpha line is at ~7630, which is beyond the i band (which is up to maybe around 8200 Angstroms? Wait, the i band is actually centered at 7480, with a width of about 1000-1500 Angstroms. So the i band covers roughly from 6500 to 8500 Angstroms. So 7630 is still within the i band. Wait, maybe my earlier calculation was wrong. Let me check the exact wavelength coverage of the i band. According to SDSS documentation, the i band has a central wavelength of 7480 Angstroms, and the effective wavelength is 7480 Angstroms, with a width of about 1000-1500 Angstroms. So the i band likely covers from around 6500 to 8500 Angstroms. Therefore, even with a redshift of z=0.163, the H_alpha line would be at 6563 * 1.163 ≈ 7630, which is still within the i band. So the H_alpha line would still be within the i band for the galaxy at 700 Mpc. Therefore, redshift is not the issue here.\n\nSo why would the astronomer choose one galaxy over another? The key is probably angular size. The closer the galaxy, the larger its angular size. For example, a galaxy of a certain physical size will appear larger on the sky if it's closer. The angular size is important because to study the profile of the H_alpha emission, you want to be able to resolve the structure of the galaxy. The angular size is given by θ = d / D, where d is the physical size and D is the distance. But we don't know the physical sizes of the galaxies. However, if we assume that the galaxies are similar in size, then the angular size is inversely proportional to the distance. So the galaxy at 1 Mpc would have the largest angular size, followed by 7 Mpc, then 70 Mpc, then 700 Mpc. Therefore, the galaxy at 1 Mpc would be the best to study the profile because it's closest and thus largest on the sky. However, there's another consideration: the surface brightness. Surface brightness is the brightness per unit area. For a galaxy, the surface brightness decreases with the square of the distance. So even though a closer galaxy is larger in angular size, its surface brightness is higher, making it easier to detect the emission. So both factors (angular size and surface brightness) favor closer galaxies.\n\nBut wait, there's another factor: the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The total flux received from the galaxy is proportional to 1/D². The SNR is proportional to the square root of the number of photons, which is proportional to the flux. So the SNR is proportional to 1/D. Therefore, the SNR is better for closer galaxies. However, if the galaxy is too close, the angular size might be too large for the instrument's field of view, making it difficult to capture the entire galaxy. But the question doesn't mention any issues with the field of view. So assuming that the instrument can handle the angular size, the best galaxy to study would be the closest one, the one at 1 Mpc.\n\nBut wait, the answer options don't include D as the correct answer. Let me check again. The options are A: 70 Mpc, B: 7 Mpc, C: 700 Mpc, D: 1 Mpc. The question is asking which galaxy she should choose. If the best is the closest one, D. But maybe there's something else. For example, if the galaxy is too close, the H_alpha line might be too narrow due to the high spatial resolution, making it harder to study the profile? Or maybe there's a trade-off between angular resolution and the redshift. Wait, the redshift for the closest galaxy is negligible, so the Doppler broadening would be minimal. But to study the profile, you might want some redshift to get a good Doppler broadening effect? No, that doesn't make sense. The profile of H_alpha emission in an active galaxy is due to various processes like outflows, rotation, etc., and you want to resolve those. The higher the angular resolution, the better to see the structure.\n\nBut another consideration: the H_alpha line in the spectrum. If the galaxy is too close, the spectral resolution might not need to be as high to resolve the line, but if it's farther away, the line is redshifted, and you need higher spectral resolution to resolve the same intrinsic velocity structure. But the question is about the profile of the H_alpha emission, which is a spatial profile or a velocity profile? The question says \"profile of the H_alpha emission\", which could mean the spatial distribution (like how the emission is distributed across the galaxy) or the velocity profile (the Doppler broadening or line shape). If it's the spatial profile, then closer is better. If it's the velocity profile, then the redshift might not matter as much as the intrinsic velocity dispersion. But the question doesn't specify. However, since the question mentions \"spectral coverage coincident with the 'i' Sloan band\", it's more likely that they are talking about the spatial profile, because the spectral coverage is about the wavelength range. To study the spatial profile, you need good angular resolution, so closer is better.\n\nBut then why would the answer not be D? The options are A, B, C, D. The answer is probably not D because maybe the galaxy is too close and the H_alpha line is not in the i band? But earlier calculations showed that even at 1 Mpc, the H_alpha line is at 6563, which is in the i band. So that's fine.\n\nWait, but the Sloan i band is actually from about 7000 to 9000 Angstroms? Wait, no, the central wavelength is 7480, but the exact coverage is from about 6500 to 8500. So 6563 is at the blue end. So it's within the band. So the H_alpha line is in the i band for all these galaxies. So the redshift is not an issue. Then why would the answer not be D? Maybe there's something else. For example, the signal-to-noise ratio for the emission line. The flux from the galaxy is proportional to 1/D². So for the galaxy at 1 Mpc, the flux is 1/(1)^2 = 1. For 7 Mpc, it's 1/49. For 70 Mpc, 1/4900. For 700 Mpc, 1/490000. So the galaxy at 1 Mpc would have the highest flux, which is best for S/N. So again, D is the best choice.\n\nBut the answer options don't include D as the correct answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the redshift calculation. Let me double-check. The i band is from about 6500 to 8500 Angstroms. The rest wavelength of H_alpha is 6563. So for a galaxy at 1 Mpc, the redshift is negligible, so the observed wavelength is 6563, which is within the i band. For a galaxy at 700 Mpc, the redshift z is v/c = (H0 * d)/c. Let's use H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc. So v = 70 * 700 = 49,000 km/s. c is 300,000 km/s. z = 49000 / 300000 ≈ 0.163. The observed wavelength is 6563 * (1 + 0.163) ≈ 6563 * 1.163 ≈ 7630 Angstroms. The i band goes up to about 8500, so 7630 is still within the i band. So the H_alpha line is still in the i band. So the redshift isn't the issue.\n\nAnother possibility: the question is about the resolution of the emission line in the spectrum. For a given spectral resolution (e.g., resolving power R = λ/Δλ), the farther the galaxy, the larger the Doppler shift needed to resolve the same velocity structure. But the question is about the profile of the emission, which could be spatial or velocity. If it's the velocity profile, then the intrinsic velocity structure is the same, but the observed Doppler shift is larger for more distant galaxies. However, the spectral resolution needed to resolve the same intrinsic velocity structure would require a smaller Δλ for more distant galaxies. But the instrument's spectral resolution is fixed. So for example, if the intrinsic velocity structure is 100 km/s, then the Doppler shift would be Δλ = λ * (v/c) = 6563 * (100/300000) ≈ 2.19 Angstroms for a nearby galaxy. For a galaxy at 700 Mpc with z=0.163, the rest frame λ is 6563 / 1.163 ≈ 5640 Angstroms (wait, no, the rest frame is always 6563). The observed wavelength is 7630. The same intrinsic velocity structure of 100 km/s would result in a Δλ of 7630 * (100/300000) ≈ 2.54 Angstroms. So the required spectral resolution to resolve this would be R = λ/Δλ = 7630 / 2.54 ≈ 3000. For the nearby galaxy, R = 6563 / 2.19 ≈ 3000. So the same spectral resolution is needed regardless of distance. Therefore, the spectral resolution isn't the issue.\n\nSo the main factors are angular size and surface brightness, both favoring closer galaxies. So the answer should be D, the galaxy at 1 Mpc. But the options are A:70 Mpc, B:7 Mpc, C:700 Mpc, D:1 Mpc. So the answer should be D. But maybe the question is a trick question? Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the fact that for very nearby galaxies, the H_alpha line might be blended with other lines or features in the spectrum, making it harder to study. But that's not a general rule. Or maybe the galaxy is too close and the angular size is too large, so the spectrum is too spread out, requiring more integration time. But the question doesn't mention any constraints on integration time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the fact that the farther the galaxy, the more the intergalactic medium might affect the light, but that's negligible for galaxies within a few hundred Mpc.\n\nWait, another angle: the question mentions that the spectral coverage is coincident with the i band. If the galaxy is too close, the H_alpha line is at the blue end of the i band, and the continuum might be brighter there, making the line harder to detect. Whereas for a more distant galaxy, the H_alpha line is shifted to the red end of the i band, where the continuum might be fainter. But this is speculative and depends on the galaxy's spectral energy distribution. Without specific information about the continuum, this is hard to assess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the fact that for more distant galaxies, the H_alpha line is redshifted into a different part of the i band where the instrument's sensitivity is better. But again, without specific information about the instrument's sensitivity, this is hard to say.\n\nGiven all this, the most straightforward answer is that the closest galaxy (D: 1 Mpc) is the best choice because it has the largest angular size and highest surface brightness, making it easier to study the H_alpha emission profile. So the answer should be D. However, the options given are A to D, and the correct answer is D. But the original question is in Chinese, and the user provided the translation. Let me check again if I misread the question.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"The inearly-approximated distances to the galaxies are approximately 1 Mpc,  7 Mpc, 70 Mpc, and 700 Mpc.\" Maybe \"inearly-approximated\" is a typo for \"approximately\"? Assuming that, the distances are as stated. The correct answer should be D: the galaxy at ~1 Mpc. But maybe the answer is different. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the i band. The i band is around 7480 Angstroms. H_alpha is at 6563. For a galaxy at 700 Mpc, the redshift is z ≈ 0.163, so the observed wavelength is 6563*(1 + z) ≈ 7630, which is still in the i band. For a galaxy at 70 Mpc, z ≈ 0.07, so observed wavelength ≈ 6563*1.07 ≈ 7022, which is in the i band. For 7 Mpc, z ≈ 0.007, so observed wavelength ≈ 6563*1.007 ≈ 6613, still in the i band. For 1 Mpc, z ≈ 0.00023, observed wavelength ≈ 6563. So all galaxies have H_alpha in the i band. Therefore, the redshift is not the issue. The main issue is angular size and surface brightness. Therefore, the best choice is D.\n\nBut the options are A, B, C, D. The answer is D. But maybe the question is a trick question. For example, if the galaxy is too close, the H_alpha emission might be too faint because the galaxy is less luminous? But the question doesn't give any information about the intrinsic luminosities of the galaxies. It just says they are active galaxies. Active galaxies typically have high luminosities, but again, we don't know the specifics.\n\nAnother possibility: the farther the galaxy, the more the light is redshifted, so the H_alpha line is easier to distinguish from other lines. But this is not necessarily true. The position of the line within the i band is still valid for all distances. So no, that's not a factor.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is D: the galaxy at ~1 Mpc. But I need to check if there's a standard answer to this type of question. In astronomy, when you want to study the detailed structure of a galaxy (like the spatial profile of an emission line), you choose the closest one. For example, the Local Group galaxies are studied for their detailed structures because they are close. So the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
