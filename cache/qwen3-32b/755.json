The reaction involves 4-aminophenol reacting with propionic anhydride in the presence of pyridine, followed by a reaction with NaOH in water. The products are labeled A and B.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when an anhydride reacts with an amine. Anhydrides are known to be good acylating agents. Since we're using pyridine, which is a base and a common catalyst in such reactions, the amine (the amino group in 4-aminophenol) is likely to attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the propionic anhydride. This would lead to an acyl substitution, forming an amide.\n\nSo, 4-aminophenol has an amino group (-NH2) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the phenol ring. The anhydride will react with the amino group. The reaction would form an amide. The product should be N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide. The structure would have the propionyl group attached to the nitrogen of the amine. The other part of the anhydride would be removed as propionic acid, but since we have a 1:1 equivalent, only one acyl group is added. So product A is probably N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide.\n\nNow, moving on to the second reaction. Product A (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide) is reacted with NaOH in water. This is a hydrolysis reaction. Amides can be hydrolyzed under basic conditions to form carboxylic acids or their conjugate bases. However, since we're using NaOH, which is a strong base, the hydrolysis of the amide should yield a carboxylic acid salt (in this case, the sodium salt of propionic acid) and an amine. Wait, but the amide here is attached to a phenyl ring. Let me think again.\n\nThe amide is N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide. If we hydrolyze the amide, the nitrogen would become a primary amine again, and the carboxylic acid part would form. So hydrolysis of the amide under basic conditions would give us back the original amine (4-aminophenol) and the sodium salt of propionic acid. However, looking at the options, the answer for B is supposed to be one of the listed products. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D says B is 4-aminophenol. If the amide is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, we would get the amine (4-aminophenol) and the sodium salt of propionic acid. So B would be 4-aminophenol. But wait, the original compound was 4-aminophenol. Wait, but in the first reaction, the amine was acylated to form an amide. Then hydrolysis would reverse that. So yes, B would be 4-aminophenol. But wait, the first product A is N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide. So the hydrolysis of that amide under basic conditions would give us 4-aminophenol and sodium propionate. So B is 4-aminophenol. So the correct answer would be D: A is N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide, B is 4-aminophenol.\n\nBut let me double-check. The first reaction is 4-aminophenol reacting with propionic anhydride. The amino group is the nucleophile. The anhydride is the acylating agent. The reaction would form an amide. So product A is N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide. Then, when that amide is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, the amide becomes the amine again. So B is 4-aminophenol. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nBut wait, another option is C: A is 4-aminophenyl propionate, B is N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide. That would be if the first reaction was an ester formation. But propionic anhydride is an anhydride, so it would react with the amine to form an amide, not an ester. Ester formation would require a reaction with an alcohol, not an amine. So the first product A is an amide, not an ester. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Similarly, option B suggests A is 4-aminophenyl propionate (an ester) and B is 4-aminophenol. But again, the first reaction forms an amide, not an ester. So B and C are incorrect.\n\nOption A says both A and B are N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide. That can't be right because the second reaction is a hydrolysis. So option A is incorrect. Option D is the only one that makes sense: A is the amide, B is the original amine after hydrolysis.\n</think>"}
