The options given are A:501.700, B:119.160, C:463.500, D:462.500. Hmm, I need to break down the structure of this molecule to calculate its molecular weight.\n\nFirst, let me parse the IUPAC name. The main chain is propan-1-ol, which means a three-carbon chain (propane) with an -OH group on the first carbon. The substituents are 2-amino, 3-methoxy, and 2-methyl. Also, the (2S) indicates the stereochemistry at the second carbon, but that might not affect the molecular weight calculation, just the configuration.\n\nSo, let's start by drawing the structure mentally. The main chain is three carbons: C1, C2, C3. The -OH is on C1. Then, on C2, there's an amino group (-NH2) and a methyl group (-CH3). On C3, there's a methoxy group (-OCH3). Wait, but the name is 3-methoxy, so the methoxy is on the third carbon. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the positions.\n\nWait, the main chain is propan-1-ol: the first carbon is the one with the hydroxyl group. So the numbering goes 1, 2, 3. So substituents are on 2 and 3. Let's list all substituents:\n\n- On C1: -OH\n- On C2: amino (-NH2) and methyl (-CH3)\n- On C3: methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nWait, but the main chain is three carbons. Let me think again. Propan-1-ol is CH2CH2CH2OH? Wait, no. Propan-1-ol is CH3CH2CH2OH. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\nCarbon 2: CH2-\nCarbon 3: CH2OH?\n\nWait, no. Wait, propane is CH3CH2CH3. So propan-1-ol would be CH3CH2CH2OH. So the hydroxyl group is on the first carbon. Then the substituents are on the second and third carbons.\n\nSo the substituents:\n\n- On C2: amino (-NH2) and methyl (-CH3)\n- On C3: methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nSo let me try to write the structure step by step.\n\nStarting with propan-1-ol: CH3CH2CH2OH.\n\nBut then, we have substituents:\n\n- 2-amino: So on the second carbon (which is the middle carbon in the three-carbon chain), there's an amino group. But the original propan-1-ol has a CH2 group on the second carbon. If we add an amino group there, that would replace one of the hydrogens. Wait, but the original structure is CH3-CH2-CH2OH. The second carbon (CH2) has two hydrogens. Adding an amino group would make it CH(NH2)... Wait, but there's also a methyl group on the second carbon. So the second carbon has both an amino and a methyl group.\n\nWait, the name is 2-amino-2-methylpropan-1-ol. So the second carbon has both an amino group and a methyl group. Let me think. So the second carbon is connected to the first carbon (CH3) and the third carbon (CH2OH). But with two substituents on the second carbon: NH2 and CH3. Wait, but the second carbon can't have two substituents and still be connected to the first and third carbons. Wait, maybe the structure is more complex. Let me try to draw it properly.\n\nThe parent chain is propane, so three carbons. The hydroxyl is on C1. The substituents are on C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are amino and methyl. The substituent on C3 is methoxy.\n\nSo, the structure would be:\n\nC1: CH2OH\nC2: connected to C1 (CH2OH) and C3 (something). But on C2, there are two substituents: NH2 and CH3. Wait, maybe the second carbon is a central carbon connected to four groups: the first carbon (CH2OH?), the third carbon (which would be CH2?), the NH2, and the CH3. Wait, but the third carbon has a methoxy group. Let me try to think again.\n\nWait, the main chain is three carbons. Let me write the structure with the substituents:\n\nCarbon 1: has the hydroxyl group (-OH). So it's connected to carbon 2 and has an -OH.\n\nCarbon 2: has an amino group (-NH2) and a methyl group (-CH3). Also connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3.\n\nCarbon 3: has a methoxy group (-OCH3). Also connected to carbon 2 and maybe something else?\n\nWait, maybe the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3?\n\nWait, but the third carbon is supposed to have a methoxy group. Wait, the name is 3-methoxy. So the methoxy is on carbon 3. So carbon 3 has an -OCH3 group. But in the parent chain, propan-1-ol would have the hydroxyl on carbon 1, and the rest would be CH2 groups. But with substituents on carbons 2 and 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3?\n\nBut then the third carbon is CH2OCH3. Wait, but the methoxy is on carbon 3. So maybe carbon 3 is CH2OCH3? That would make the methoxy group on carbon 3. Let me check the IUPAC name again. The name is (2S)-2-amino-3-methoxy-2-methylpropan-1-ol. So the substituents are:\n\n- 2-amino: amino group on C2\n- 3-methoxy: methoxy group on C3\n- 2-methyl: methyl group on C2\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: has an amino group (-NH2), a methyl group (-CH3), connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3\nCarbon 3: has a methoxy group (-OCH3), connected to carbon 2 and maybe a hydrogen?\n\nWait, but the parent chain is propane, so three carbons. So carbon 3 is connected to carbon 2 and a hydrogen? Wait, but with the methoxy group on carbon 3, perhaps it's CH2OCH3. Wait, but then the structure would be:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3\n\nBut then the parent chain is three carbons: carbon 1 is CH2OH, carbon 2 is CH(NH2)(CH3), carbon 3 is CH2OCH3. Wait, but the parent chain is propane, so each carbon should be connected in a straight chain. Let me think again. The parent chain is propan-1-ol, which is CH2CH2CH2OH? No, wait, propane is CH3CH2CH3. So propan-1-ol would be CH3CH2CH2OH. But with substituents on C2 and C3.\n\nBut if we add substituents on C2 and C3, the structure becomes more complex. Let me try to write the formula step by step.\n\nStarting with propan-1-ol: CH3CH2CH2OH. But the actual structure with substituents:\n\n- On C2 (the middle carbon), there's an amino group (-NH2) and a methyl group (-CH3). So instead of the middle carbon being CH2, it would be CH(NH2)(CH3).\n\n- On C3, there's a methoxy group (-OCH3). The original propan-1-ol has CH2OH on C3. But adding a methoxy group would mean replacing one of the hydrogens on C3 with -OCH3. Wait, but the original propan-1-ol's C3 is CH2OH. So if we add a methoxy group on C3, it would be CH(OH)OCH3? Wait, but the name is 3-methoxy, so the methoxy is on C3. So maybe the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3\n\nBut that would make the parent chain three carbons with substituents. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3\n\nYes, that seems possible. So the molecule would be:\n\nCH2OH-CH(NH2)(CH3)-CH2OCH3\n\nWait, but then the hydroxyl group is on carbon 1, the amino and methyl on carbon 2, and the methoxy on carbon 3. That seems to fit the IUPAC name.\n\nNow, let's write the molecular formula based on this structure.\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH → 2 H, 1 O, 1 C\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3) → 1 C connected to NH2 and CH3, and connected to C1 and C3\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3 → 2 H, 1 O, 1 C, and OCH3\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write the entire structure:\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH → C, 2 H, O, H (from OH)\nWait, actually, the first carbon is CH2OH. So that's C, two H's, and then the OH group. So total for C1: 1 C, 2 H, and 1 O (from OH).\n\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3). This carbon is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (CH2OH)\n- Carbon 3 (CH2OCH3)\n- NH2 group\n- CH3 group\n\nSo the carbon at position 2 has four bonds: to C1, C3, NH2, and CH3. So the formula for C2 would be CH(NH2)(CH3).\n\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3. This is a methoxy group attached to the CH2 group. So carbon 3 has two H's, and then the OCH3 group. So that's C, two H, O, and CH3 (which is another C and three H's).\n\nNow, let's count all the atoms:\n\nCarbon atoms:\n\n- C1: 1\n- C2: 1\n- C3: 1\n- In CH3 on C2: 1\n- In OCH3 on C3: 1\nTotal C: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n\nHydrogen atoms:\n\nC1: CH2OH has 2 H's from CH2, and 1 H from OH. Total 3 H.\nC2: The carbon at position 2 is CH(NH2)(CH3). The carbon has bonds to NH2 and CH3. The NH2 has 2 H's. The CH3 has 3 H's. Plus the bonds to C1 and C3. Wait, but the carbon at position 2 is connected to four groups: NH2, CH3, C1, and C3. So the carbon itself has no H's. The H's are in the NH2 and CH3 groups.\n\nSo for H in NH2: 2 H\nFor H in CH3: 3 H\nPlus the H's from the bonds to C1 and C3? Wait, no, because the carbon is bonded to four groups, so it doesn't have any H's. So H from C2 is only from NH2 and CH3: 2 + 3 = 5 H.\n\nC3: CH2OCH3. The CH2 has 2 H's. The OCH3 has 3 H's. So total H from C3: 2 + 3 = 5 H.\n\nAlso, the OH group on C1 has 1 H.\n\nTotal H: 3 (from C1) + 5 (from C2) + 5 (from C3) + 1 (from OH) = 14 H.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some H's. Let me recount carefully.\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH. The CH2 has two H's, and the OH has one H. So 3 H's here.\n\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3). The carbon at position 2 is bonded to NH2, CH3, C1, and C3. So the NH2 has two H's, and the CH3 has three H's. The C1 and C3 are single bonds. So total H's from C2's groups: 2 (NH2) + 3 (CH3) = 5 H.\n\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3. The CH2 has two H's, and the OCH3 has three H's. So 2 + 3 = 5 H.\n\nOH group on C1: 1 H.\n\nTotal H: 3 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 14 H.\n\nWait, but maybe there are more H's. Let's think about the NH2 group. The NH2 has two H's. The CH3 on C2 has three H's. The OCH3 on C3 has three H's. The CH2 on C3 has two H's. The CH2 on C1 has two H's, and the OH has one H. So total H is 2 (NH2) + 3 (CH3) + 3 (OCH3) + 2 (CH2 on C3) + 2 (CH2 on C1) + 1 (OH) = 2+3+3+2+2+1=13? Wait, earlier I had 14. Where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I'm double-counting or missing some. Let me approach it differently. Let's write the entire molecular formula.\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nCH2OH-CH(NH2)(CH3)-CH2OCH3\n\nSo expanding this:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH → C, 2 H, OH (O and H)\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3) → C, NH2 (N and 2 H), CH3 (C and 3 H)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3 → C, 2 H, O, CH3 (C and 3 H)\n\nLet's list all atoms:\n\nCarbon atoms:\n- Carbon 1: 1 C\n- Carbon 2: 1 C\n- Carbon 3: 1 C\n- CH3 on Carbon 2: 1 C\n- CH3 on Carbon 3: 1 C\nTotal C: 5\n\nHydrogen atoms:\n- Carbon 1: 2 H (from CH2) + 1 H (from OH) = 3 H\n- NH2: 2 H\n- CH3 on Carbon 2: 3 H\n- Carbon 3: 2 H (from CH2)\n- OCH3 on Carbon 3: 3 H\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 13 H\n\nWait, that's 13 H. Where is the 14th H? Maybe I missed one. Let me check again.\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH has 2 H from CH2 and 1 H from OH. Total 3 H.\n\nCarbon 2: The carbon is bonded to NH2, CH3, C1, and C3. The NH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H. No H on the carbon itself. So 2 + 3 = 5 H.\n\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3. The CH2 has 2 H, and the OCH3 has 3 H. So 2 + 3 = 5 H.\n\nOH group: 1 H.\n\nTotal H: 3 (C1) + 5 (C2) + 5 (C3) + 1 (OH) = 14 H. But when I broke it down into parts, I got 13. Maybe I missed the H in the OH group when I did the other breakdown. Yes, in the first breakdown, I included the OH H (1) in the total, but in the second breakdown, I might have missed it. Let's see:\n\nIn the second breakdown, I had:\n\nCarbon 1: 3 H (from CH2OH)\nNH2: 2 H\nCH3 on C2: 3 H\nCarbon 3: 2 H (from CH2)\nOCH3 on C3: 3 H\nOH group: 1 H (already included in Carbon 1's 3 H)\n\nWait, the OH group's H is part of the CH2OH in Carbon 1. So the total H is 3 (from C1) + 2 (NH2) + 3 (CH3) + 2 (CH2 on C3) + 3 (OCH3) = 3+2+3+2+3=13. But earlier I had 14. Where is the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the first breakdown. Let's re-express the entire molecule properly. The correct formula is:\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH → C, 2 H, O, H (from OH)\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3) → C, NH2 (N and 2 H), CH3 (C and 3 H)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3 → C, 2 H, O, CH3 (C and 3 H)\n\nSo let's count each atom type:\n\nCarbon: 5 (from the five C atoms listed above)\nHydrogen: Let's count each H:\n\n- Carbon 1: CH2 has 2 H, and OH has 1 H → 3 H\n- NH2: 2 H\n- CH3 on Carbon 2: 3 H\n- CH2 on Carbon 3: 2 H\n- OCH3 on Carbon 3: 3 H\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 13 H\n\nWait, so why did I get 14 before? Maybe I was counting the OH H twice. The OH H is already included in the 3 H from Carbon 1. So the correct total H is 13.\n\nOxygen atoms:\n\n- From Carbon 1's OH: 1 O\n- From Carbon 3's OCH3: 1 O\nTotal O: 2 O\n\nNitrogen atoms:\n\n- From NH2: 1 N\n\nSo the molecular formula is C5H13NO2.\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nCarbon: 5\nHydrogen: 13\nNitrogen: 1\nOxygen: 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the molar mass.\n\nCarbon: 5 * 12.01 = 60.05 g/mol\nHydrogen: 13 * 1.008 = 13.104 g/mol\nNitrogen: 1 * 14.01 = 14.01 g/mol\nOxygen: 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass = 60.05 + 13.104 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 119.164 g/mol\n\nLooking at the options, B is 119.160 g/mol, which is very close to our calculated 119.164 g/mol. The slight difference is due to rounding of atomic masses. For example, the exact atomic mass of carbon is about 12.011, hydrogen is 1.008, nitrogen is 14.007, and oxygen is 15.999. Let's recalculate with more precise values.\n\nCarbon: 5 * 12.011 = 60.055 g/mol\nHydrogen: 13 * 1.008 = 13.104 g/mol\nNitrogen: 1 * 14.007 = 14.007 g/mol\nOxygen: 2 * 15.999 = 31.998 g/mol\n\nTotal = 60.055 + 13.104 + 14.007 + 31.998 = 119.164 g/mol\n\nRounded to three decimal places, it would be 119.164 g/mol, which is approximately 119.16 g/mol. So option B is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the molecular formula. Did I make a mistake in the structure?\n\nLet me re-examine the IUPAC name again: (2S)-2-amino-3-methoxy-2-methylpropan-1-ol.\n\nThe parent chain is propane with a hydroxyl group on C1 (propan-1-ol). The substituents are:\n\n- 2-amino: amino group on C2\n- 2-methyl: methyl group on C2\n- 3-methoxy: methoxy group on C3\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2OH\nCarbon 2: CH(NH2)(CH3)\nCarbon 3: CH2OCH3\n\nYes, that's correct. So the molecular formula is indeed C5H13NO2, and the molar mass is approximately 119.16 g/mol. Therefore, the correct answer is B:119.160.\n</think>"}
