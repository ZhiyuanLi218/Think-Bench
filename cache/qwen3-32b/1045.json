The answer should be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Alright, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that the tangent function is positive in the first and third quadrants (i.e., angles between 0° and 90°, and 180° to 270°) and negative in the second and fourth quadrants (90° to 180°, and 270° to 360°). Since θ is between 0° and 90°, multiplying by 2ⁿ will rotate the angle multiple times around the unit circle. The sign of tan(2ⁿθ) depends on which quadrant 2ⁿθ is in.\n\nThe problem says tan(2ⁿθ) is positive when n is a multiple of 3 (i.e., n=0,3,6,...) and negative otherwise. So for n=0, tan(θ) is positive. Since θ is between 0° and 90°, tan(θ) is positive, which checks out. For n=1, tan(2θ) should be negative. For n=2, tan(4θ) should be negative. For n=3, tan(8θ) should be positive. Then for n=4, tan(16θ) negative, n=5 tan(32θ) negative, n=6 tan(64θ) positive, and so on.\n\nSo I need to find θ such that:\n\n- tan(θ) > 0 (which it is since θ is between 0° and 90°)\n- tan(2θ) < 0\n- tan(4θ) < 0\n- tan(8θ) > 0\n- tan(16θ) < 0\n- tan(32θ) < 0\n- tan(64θ) > 0\n- etc.\n\nSo each time n increases by 1, we double the angle. The sign alternates in a pattern of two negatives followed by a positive, repeating every three steps. So the key is to figure out θ such that doubling the angle three times (multiplying by 8) brings us back to a positive tangent, i.e., the angle modulo 180° is in the first or third quadrant. But since θ is between 0° and 90°, and we're doubling each time, let's think about how angles wrap around.\n\nLet me think in terms of modulo 180°, because tangent has a period of 180°, so tan(x) = tan(x + 180°k) for any integer k. Therefore, the sign of tan(2ⁿθ) depends on 2ⁿθ modulo 180°.\n\nLet me denote φ_n = 2ⁿθ mod 180°. Then:\n\n- For n=0: φ_0 = θ mod 180° = θ ∈ (0°, 90°), so tan(φ_0) > 0\n- For n=1: φ_1 = 2θ mod 180°, tan(φ_1) < 0\n- For n=2: φ_2 = 4θ mod 180°, tan(φ_2) < 0\n- For n=3: φ_3 = 8θ mod 180°, tan(φ_3) > 0\n- For n=4: φ_4 = 16θ mod 180°, tan(φ_4) < 0\n- For n=5: φ_5 = 32θ mod 180°, tan(φ_5) < 0\n- For n=6: φ_6 = 64θ mod 180°, tan(φ_6) > 0\n- etc.\n\nSo the pattern is that every third step, the angle modulo 180° is in a quadrant where tangent is positive, otherwise negative. Let me think about what this implies for θ.\n\nSince tan(φ_n) is positive when n ≡ 0 mod 3 and negative otherwise, that suggests that φ_n is in quadrant I or III when n ≡ 0 mod 3, and in quadrant II or IV otherwise.\n\nBut since θ is between 0° and 90°, let's see:\n\nStarting with θ in (0°, 90°). Let's analyze each step.\n\nFor n=0: θ ∈ (0°, 90°), so quadrant I, tan positive.\n\nFor n=1: 2θ. For tan(2θ) to be negative, 2θ must be in quadrant II or IV. Since θ is between 0° and 90°, 2θ is between 0° and 180°. So to be in quadrant II, 2θ must be between 90° and 180°, so θ between 45° and 90°. Quadrant IV would be between 270° and 360°, but since 2θ is between 0° and 180°, it can't be in quadrant IV. So θ must be between 45° and 90°, so that 2θ is between 90° and 180°, quadrant II, tan negative. Okay, so θ ∈ (45°, 90°).\n\nFor n=2: 4θ. tan(4θ) < 0. Let's see. θ is between 45° and 90°, so 4θ is between 180° and 360°. So 4θ is between 180° and 360°, so it's in quadrant III or IV. tan is positive in III and negative in IV. So for tan(4θ) to be negative, 4θ must be in quadrant IV. Quadrant IV is between 270° and 360°, so 4θ ∈ (270°, 360°). Therefore θ ∈ (270°/4, 360°/4) = (67.5°, 90°). So θ must be between 67.5° and 90°, narrowing down from previous interval (45°, 90°) to (67.5°, 90°).\n\nFor n=3: 8θ. tan(8θ) > 0. Let's see θ ∈ (67.5°, 90°), so 8θ is between 8*67.5°=540° and 8*90°=720°. Let's subtract multiples of 180° to find the equivalent angle between 0° and 180°. Since tan has period 180°, so tan(8θ) = tan(8θ - k*180°). Let's compute 8θ mod 180°.\n\nLet me compute 540° mod 180° = 540 - 3*180 = 0°, and 720° mod 180° = 0°. Wait, but θ is between 67.5° and 90°, so 8θ is between 540° and 720°, so 8θ mod 180° is between 0° and 180°, but since 540° is 3*180°, and 720° is 4*180°, so 8θ mod 180° is 8θ - 3*180° when θ ≥ 67.5°, since 8*67.5° = 540°, so subtracting 3*180°=540°, so 8θ - 540°. Therefore 8θ mod 180° is between 0° and 180°, specifically between 0° and 720° - 540° = 180°, so between 0° and 180°. For tan(8θ) to be positive, 8θ mod 180° must be in quadrant I or III. So between 0° and 90°, or between 180°-90°=90° and 180°? Wait, quadrant III is between 180° and 270°, but modulo 180°, angles between 180° and 360° are equivalent to angles between 0° and 180°, but with sign changes. Wait, actually, tan(θ) = tan(θ + 180°k). So tan(φ) is positive when φ is in quadrant I or III. So if we have φ = 8θ mod 180°, then tan(φ) is positive if φ is in (0°, 90°) or (90°, 180°)? Wait, no. Wait tan is positive in QI (0-90) and QIII (180-270). But when we take φ mod 180°, angles in QIII (180-270) become φ - 180° (which is 0-90°). Wait, no. Wait if φ is between 180° and 360°, then φ mod 180° is φ - 180° if φ ∈ [180°, 360°). So tan(φ) = tan(φ - 180°). Therefore tan is positive when φ - 180° is in QI or QIII? Wait no. tan(φ) = tan(φ - 180°). So if φ is in QIII (180-270), φ - 180° is in QI (0-90). tan(φ) = tan(φ - 180°) which is positive. If φ is in QIV (270-360), φ - 180° is in QII (90-180). tan(φ) = tan(φ - 180°) which is negative. Therefore, tan(φ) is positive iff φ mod 180° is in QI (0-90) or QIII mod 180° which is equivalent to φ mod 180° in QI. Wait, no. Wait if φ is in QI (0-90), tan positive. If φ is in QII (90-180), tan negative. If φ is in QIII (180-270), tan positive (since tan(φ) = tan(φ - 180°) which is in QI). If φ is in QIV (270-360), tan negative (tan(φ) = tan(φ - 180°) which is in QII). Therefore, tan(φ) is positive iff φ mod 180° is in (0°, 90°). Because if φ mod 180° is in (0°, 90°), tan is positive; if it's in (90°, 180°), tan is negative. Wait that seems conflicting with previous. Wait let me check:\n\nTake φ = 180° + α where α is between 0° and 90°, so φ is in QIII. tan(φ) = tan(α) which is positive. But φ mod 180° is α. So tan(φ) = tan(α). Therefore tan(φ) is positive if φ mod 180° is between 0° and 90°, and negative if between 90° and 180°. Therefore, tan(φ) is positive iff φ mod 180° ∈ (0°, 90°). Therefore, for tan(8θ) to be positive, 8θ mod 180° must be between 0° and 90°. So 8θ mod 180° ∈ (0°, 90°). Given that θ ∈ (67.5°, 90°), 8θ ∈ (540°, 720°). As before, 8θ mod 180° is 8θ - 3*180° = 8θ - 540°. Therefore 8θ - 540° ∈ (0°, 720° - 540°) = (0°, 180°). We need this to be in (0°, 90°). Therefore:\n\n0 < 8θ - 540° < 90°\n\nAdding 540°:\n\n540° < 8θ < 630°\n\nDivide by 8:\n\n540°/8 < θ < 630°/8\n\nWhich is:\n\n67.5° < θ < 78.75°\n\nSo θ must be between 67.5° and 78.75°, narrowing down the previous interval of (67.5°, 90°) to (67.5°, 78.75°). \n\nNow moving on to n=4: tan(16θ) < 0. Let's analyze this. θ is between 67.5° and 78.75°, so 16θ is between 16*67.5° and 16*78.75°. Let me calculate those:\n\n16*67.5° = 1080°, 16*78.75° = 1260°. So 16θ ∈ (1080°, 1260°). Let's compute 16θ mod 180°. Since 1080° is 6*180°, so 16θ mod 180° is 16θ - 6*180° = 16θ - 1080°. Therefore:\n\n16θ - 1080° ∈ (1080° - 1080°, 1260° - 1080°) = (0°, 180°). For tan(16θ) to be negative, we need 16θ mod 180° ∈ (90°, 180°). Therefore:\n\n90° < 16θ - 1080° < 180°\n\nAdding 1080°:\n\n1080° + 90° < 16θ < 1080° + 180°\n\nWhich is:\n\n1170° < 16θ < 1260°\n\nDivide by 16:\n\n1170°/16 < θ < 1260°/16\n\nCalculate:\n\n1170 / 16 = 73.125°, 1260 / 16 = 78.75°\n\nTherefore θ ∈ (73.125°, 78.75°). So now our interval is narrowed from (67.5°, 78.75°) to (73.125°, 78.75°).\n\nNext, for n=5: tan(32θ) < 0. Let's compute 32θ. θ ∈ (73.125°, 78.75°), so 32θ is between 32*73.125° and 32*78.75°.\n\nCalculate:\n\n32*73.125° = Let's compute 73.125 * 32. First, 70*32 = 2240, 3.125*32 = 100, so total 2240 + 100 = 2340°.\n\nSimilarly, 32*78.75° = Let's compute 78.75*32. 70*32=2240, 8.75*32=280, so total 2240 + 280 = 2520°. Therefore 32θ ∈ (2340°, 2520°). Let's compute 32θ mod 180°. Since 180°*13 = 2340°, so 2340° is 13*180°, and 2520° is 14*180°. Therefore 32θ mod 180° is 32θ - 13*180° when θ ≥ 73.125°, since 32*73.125° = 2340°. Therefore:\n\nFor θ ∈ (73.125°, 78.75°), 32θ ∈ (2340°, 2520°), so mod 180° is (0°, 180°). Specifically, 32θ - 13*180° = 32θ - 2340° ∈ (0°, 180°). For tan(32θ) to be negative, we need 32θ mod 180° ∈ (90°, 180°). Therefore:\n\n90° < 32θ - 2340° < 180°\n\nAdding 2340°:\n\n2340° + 90° < 32θ < 2340° + 180°\n\nWhich is:\n\n2430° < 32θ < 2520°\n\nDivide by 32:\n\n2430 / 32 < θ < 2520 / 32\n\nCalculate:\n\n2430 / 32 = 75.9375°, 2520 / 32 = 78.75°\n\nTherefore θ ∈ (75.9375°, 78.75°). So narrowing the interval from (73.125°, 78.75°) to (75.9375°, 78.75°).\n\nMoving on to n=6: tan(64θ) > 0. Let's compute 64θ. θ is between 75.9375° and 78.75°, so 64θ is between 64*75.9375° and 64*78.75°.\n\nCalculate:\n\nFirst 64*75.9375. Let's note that 75.9375° = 75 + 15/16 degrees? Wait, 0.9375 is 15/16? Wait 0.9375 = 15/16? No, 1/16 is 0.0625, 15/16 is 0.9375, yes. So 75.9375° = 75° + 15/16°. But maybe better to calculate directly.\n\nBut perhaps better to note that 64θ mod 180°. Let me think. Let me compute 64θ. Let me note that each time we double the angle, so maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 64θ. Since θ is between 75.9375° and 78.75°, multiply by 64:\n\nLower bound: 64 * 75.9375 = ?\n\nWell, 75.9375 * 64. Let me compute 75 * 64 + 0.9375 * 64.\n\n75*64: 70*64=4480, 5*64=320, total 4480+320=4800.\n\n0.9375*64: 0.9375 is 15/16. 15/16 * 64 = 15*4 = 60. Therefore total is 4800 + 60 = 4860°.\n\nUpper bound: 64 * 78.75°. 78.75 * 64. 70*64=4480, 8.75*64=560. Total 4480 + 560 = 5040°.\n\nSo 64θ ∈ (4860°, 5040°). Let's compute mod 180°. Since 180° * 27 = 4860°, and 180° * 28 = 5040°. Therefore, 64θ mod 180° is 64θ - 27*180° = 64θ - 4860°. Therefore:\n\nFor θ ∈ (75.9375°, 78.75°), 64θ - 4860° ∈ (0°, 180°). For tan(64θ) to be positive, we need 64θ mod 180° ∈ (0°, 90°). Therefore:\n\n0° < 64θ - 4860° < 90°\n\nAdding 4860°:\n\n4860° < 64θ < 4860° + 90° = 4950°\n\nDivide by 64:\n\n4860 / 64 < θ < 4950 / 64\n\nCalculate:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 2430 / 32 and 2475 / 32.\n\nEarlier, we had 2430 / 32 = 75.9375°, which is the lower bound. Now 4950 / 64 = ?\n\nWell, 4950 divided by 64: Let's compute 64*77 = 4928. 4950 - 4928 = 22. So 77 + 22/64 = 77 + 11/32 ≈ 77.34375°. Therefore:\n\nθ ∈ (75.9375°, 77.34375°). So the interval narrows from (75.9375°, 78.75°) to (75.9375°, 77.34375°).\n\nSo now, moving on to n=7: tan(128θ) < 0. Let me check if I need to continue? The problem says that the pattern is positive when n is a multiple of 3, so n=0,3,6,... and negative otherwise. So for n=6 we already considered, and n=7 would be next negative. But perhaps there is an infinite sequence of these conditions, so θ must satisfy all of them. Therefore, we need to keep narrowing down the interval.\n\nBut maybe there's a pattern here where each time the interval gets halved or something? Let me try to continue.\n\nFor n=7: tan(128θ) < 0. Let's compute 128θ. θ is between 75.9375° and 77.34375°. Let me compute 128θ:\n\nLower bound: 128 * 75.9375°. Let me note that 75.9375° was 4860° / 64, so multiplying by 128 gives 4860° * 2 = 9720°.\n\nUpper bound: 128 * 77.34375°. Let me compute 77.34375° * 128. Since 77.34375° was 4950° / 64, multiplying by 128 gives 4950° * 2 = 9900°. Therefore, 128θ ∈ (9720°, 9900°). Let's compute mod 180°. 9720° divided by 180° is 9720 / 180 = 54. So 54*180° = 9720°, so mod 180° is 0°. Therefore, 128θ mod 180° is 128θ - 54*180° = 128θ - 9720°. Therefore:\n\nFor θ ∈ (75.9375°, 77.34375°), 128θ ∈ (9720°, 9900°), so mod 180° is between 0° and 180°. For tan(128θ) < 0, we need 128θ mod 180° ∈ (90°, 180°). Therefore:\n\n90° < 128θ - 9720° < 180°\n\nAdding 9720°:\n\n9720° + 90° < 128θ < 9720° + 180°\n\nWhich is:\n\n9810° < 128θ < 9900°\n\nDivide by 128:\n\n9810 / 128 < θ < 9900 / 128\n\nCalculate:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 4905 / 64 and 4950 / 64.\n\nCompute 4905 / 64: Let's see, 64*76 = 4864. 4905 - 4864 = 41. So 76 + 41/64 ≈ 76.640625°\n\nSimilarly, 4950 / 64 = 77.34375° as before.\n\nTherefore θ ∈ (76.640625°, 77.34375°). So narrowing down the interval from (75.9375°, 77.34375°) to (76.640625°, 77.34375°).\n\nContinuing for n=8: tan(256θ) < 0. Let's compute 256θ. θ ∈ (76.640625°, 77.34375°). Let me compute 256θ:\n\nLower bound: 256 * 76.640625°. Since 76.640625° was 4905 / 64, multiplying by 256 gives 4905 * 4 = 19620°\n\nUpper bound: 256 * 77.34375° = 4950 / 64 * 256 = 4950 * 4 = 19800°. Therefore 256θ ∈ (19620°, 19800°). Let's compute mod 180°. Since 180°*109 = 19620°, because 180*100=18000, 180*9=1620, total 18000+1620=19620. Therefore 256θ mod 180° is 256θ - 109*180° = 256θ - 19620°. Therefore:\n\nFor θ ∈ (76.640625°, 77.34375°), 256θ ∈ (19620°, 19800°). Therefore mod 180° is between 0° and 180°. For tan(256θ) < 0, need 256θ mod 180° ∈ (90°, 180°). Therefore:\n\n90° < 256θ - 19620° < 180°\n\nAdding 19620°:\n\n19620° + 90° < 256θ < 19620° + 180°\n\nWhich is:\n\n19710° < 256θ < 19800°\n\nDivide by 256:\n\n19710 / 256 < θ < 19800 / 256\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 9855 / 128 ≈ 76.9921875° and 9900 / 128 ≈ 77.34375°.\n\nSo θ ∈ (76.9921875°, 77.34375°). So narrowing down from (76.640625°, 77.34375°) to (76.9921875°, 77.34375°).\n\nContinuing for n=9: tan(512θ) > 0. Let me check what happens here. For n=9, which is a multiple of 3 (since 9=3*3), so tan(512θ) should be positive. Let's compute 512θ. θ is between approx 76.992° and 77.344°. Let me compute 512θ:\n\nLower bound: 512 * 76.9921875°. Since θ was 19710° / 256, multiplying by 512 gives 19710 * 2 = 39420°.\n\nUpper bound: 512 * 77.34375° = 19800° * 2 = 39600°.\n\nTherefore 512θ ∈ (39420°, 39600°). Let's compute mod 180°. Since 180°*219 = 39420°, because 180*200=36000, 180*19=3420, total 36000+3420=39420. Therefore 512θ mod 180° is 512θ - 219*180° = 512θ - 39420°. Therefore:\n\nFor θ ∈ (76.9921875°, 77.34375°), 512θ ∈ (39420°, 39600°), so mod 180° is between 0° and 180°. For tan(512θ) > 0, need 512θ mod 180° ∈ (0°, 90°). Therefore:\n\n0° < 512θ - 39420° < 90°\n\nAdding 39420°:\n\n39420° < 512θ < 39420° + 90° = 39510°\n\nDivide by 512:\n\n39420 / 512 < θ < 39510 / 512\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 19710 / 256 ≈ 76.9921875°, and 39510 / 512 ≈ let's compute 39510 / 512. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 2 again? Not sure. Let me compute 512*77 = 512*70 + 512*7 = 35840 + 3584 = 39424. Then 39510 - 39424 = 86. Therefore 39510 / 512 = 77 + 86/512 = 77 + 43/256 ≈ 77.16796875°. Therefore θ ∈ (76.9921875°, 77.16796875°). So narrowing down from (76.992°, 77.344°) to (76.992°, 77.168°).\n\nContinuing this process would narrow down θ further each time. It seems like θ is approaching some limit. Since the problem states there is a unique angle θ between 0° and 90° satisfying these conditions, so θ is the limit of these intervals.\n\nThis seems similar to a binary search, each time halving the interval. The intervals are getting smaller by factors of 1/2 each time? Let me check the previous steps:\n\nFrom n=0 to n=1: interval (0,90) to (45,90) size 45\n\nn=1 to n=2: (45,90) to (67.5,90) size 22.5\n\nn=2 to n=3: (67.5,90) to (67.5,78.75) size 11.25\n\nn=3 to n=4: (67.5,78.75) to (73.125,78.75) size 5.625\n\nn=4 to n=5: (73.125,78.75) to (75.9375,78.75) size 2.8125\n\nn=5 to n=6: (75.9375,78.75) to (75.9375,77.34375) size 1.40625\n\nn=6 to n=7: (75.9375,77.34375) to (76.640625,77.34375) size 0.703125\n\nn=7 to n=8: (76.640625,77.34375) to (76.9921875,77.34375) size 0.3515625\n\nn=8 to n=9: (76.9921875,77.34375) to (76.9921875,77.16796875) size 0.17578125\n\nSo each time, the interval is halved. Therefore, continuing this process infinitely would narrow down θ to a single value. This seems like θ is a limit point of these intervals. Therefore, perhaps θ can be represented as a fraction with denominator a power of 2? Because each step is dividing by 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to model this with equations. Let me think.\n\nLet me note that each time we have a condition on θ such that doubling the angle three times (multiplying by 8) brings us back to an angle that is coterminal with an angle in (0°, 90°). Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, since each time we have a condition that 2³θ ≡ θ + k*180°? Wait, no. Wait for n=3, tan(8θ) > 0, which required 8θ ≡ some angle between 0° and 90° modulo 180°. Similarly, for n=6, tan(64θ) > 0 requires 64θ ≡ between 0° and 90° modulo 180°, etc. So perhaps there's a recursive relation here?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let me denote that each time, after three doublings, the angle is in a specific range. Let me try to find θ such that:\n\nStarting with θ, after three doublings (i.e., multiplying by 8), θ becomes 8θ ≡ α mod 180°, where α is between 0° and 90°, and then the same pattern repeats? Because if tan(8θ) is positive, then for the next set of conditions (n=3,4,5,...), it would be similar to the original problem but starting at 8θ instead of θ. Therefore, maybe θ satisfies 8θ ≡ θ mod 180°? Wait, but if 8θ ≡ θ mod 180°, then 7θ ≡ 0 mod 180°, so θ ≡ 0 mod (180°/7). But θ is between 0° and 90°, so θ = 180°/7 ≈ 25.7°, but that contradicts our previous intervals where θ is around 77°. So maybe not exactly congruent, but similar?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps θ satisfies 8θ = θ + 180°k for some integer k? Which would lead to 7θ = 180°k, so θ = (180°k)/7. Since θ is between 0° and 90°, k can be 1, 2, or 3:\n\nk=1: θ ≈ 25.7°, which is not in our interval.\n\nk=2: θ ≈ 51.4°, still not in our current interval of ~77°.\n\nk=3: θ ≈ 77.14°, which is in our current interval of (76.99°, 77.17°). Wait! 180*3/7 ≈ 540/7 ≈ 77.142857°, which is approximately 77.14°, which is within our current interval of (≈76.99°, ≈77.17°). So maybe θ = 540/7°?\n\nWait let me check 540 divided by 7 is approximately 77.142857°, which is within our last interval. Let me check if this θ satisfies the conditions.\n\nLet me test θ = 540/7° ≈ 77.142857°.\n\nLet me check for n=0: tan(θ) positive. θ is in first quadrant, yes.\n\nn=1: tan(2θ). Let's compute 2θ = 1080/7 ≈ 154.2857°. Which is in second quadrant (between 90° and 180°), so tan is negative. Good.\n\nn=2: tan(4θ). 4θ = 2160/7 ≈ 308.5714°. Which is in fourth quadrant (between 270° and 360°), tan is negative. Good.\n\nn=3: tan(8θ). 8θ = 4320/7 ≈ 617.1428°. Let's subtract 360° to get equivalent angle: 617.1428 - 360 = 257.1428°. Which is in third quadrant (between 180° and 270°), tan is positive. Wait but earlier we thought tan(8θ) should be positive. Wait 257.14° is in third quadrant, tan is positive. Yes, so tan(8θ) is positive. Good.\n\nn=4: tan(16θ). 16θ = 8640/7 ≈ 1234.2857°. Let's subtract multiples of 180° to find equivalent angle. But tan has period 180°, so let me compute 1234.2857 mod 180°. Let me divide 1234.2857 by 180. 180*6=1080, 180*7=1260. So 1234.2857 - 1080 = 154.2857°, which is the same as 2θ. Which is in second quadrant, tan negative. Good, matches the condition for n=4 (which is not multiple of 3).\n\nn=5: tan(32θ). 32θ = 17280/7 ≈ 2468.5714°. Let's compute mod 180°. 2468.5714 / 180 ≈ 13.714... So 13*180=2340, 2468.5714 - 2340 = 128.5714°, which is 4θ mod 180°? Wait 4θ was ≈308.57°, which mod 180° is 308.57 - 180 = 128.57°, yes. So tan(32θ) = tan(128.57°) which is in second quadrant, tan negative. Good, n=5 not multiple of 3.\n\nn=6: tan(64θ). 64θ = 34560/7 ≈ 4937.1428°. Let's compute mod 180°. 4937.1428 / 180 ≈ 27.428... 27*180=4860, 4937.1428 - 4860 = 77.1428°, which is θ. So tan(64θ) = tan(θ) which is positive. Good, since n=6 is multiple of 3.\n\nn=7: tan(128θ). 128θ = 64*2θ ≡ tan(2θ) which is negative. As above, 2θ ≈154.28°, negative. Correct.\n\nn=8: tan(256θ) ≡ tan(4θ) ≡ negative. Correct.\n\nn=9: tan(512θ) ≡ tan(8θ) ≡ positive. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to cycle every three steps. Therefore θ = 540/7° satisfies all the conditions! Because multiplying by 8 gives 8θ = 540/7 * 8 = 4320/7, which mod 180° is equivalent to θ + 180°*k? Wait, 8θ = θ + 180°*k?\n\nWait 8θ - θ = 7θ = 180°*k. Which would be 7*(540/7) = 540° = 180°*3. Yes! So 7θ = 540° = 3*180°, so θ = 540°/7. Therefore, θ satisfies 7θ = 3*180°, so θ = (3*180)/7 = 540/7°. Therefore θ = 540/7°, which is approximately 77.142857°, which is exactly the value that fits into our narrowing intervals. Therefore, θ = 540/7°, which is in reduced fraction terms. Since 540 and 7 are coprime? 540 ÷ 7 is 77 and 1/7, so 540 and 7 share no common factors besides 1. Wait 540 factors into 2² * 3³ * 5, and 7 is prime, so yes, they are coprime? Wait 540/7 is already in lowest terms? Yes, since 7 doesn't divide 540. Therefore p=540, q=7, so p+q=547.\n\nWait, but let me check if 540 and 7 are coprime. GCD(540,7). Since 7 divides into 540 how many times? 7*77=539, remainder 1. Then GCD(7,1)=1. Therefore yes, they are coprime. Therefore the answer is 540 + 7 = 547.\n\nBut let me check once more if θ=540/7° satisfies all the required conditions. For example, tan(2^nθ) positive when n divisible by 3, else negative. As we checked up to n=9, and it worked. Since the relation 8θ ≡ θ mod 180° (since 8θ - θ = 7θ = 540° = 3*180°, so 8θ = θ + 3*180°), which means that tan(8θ) = tan(θ + 3*180°) = tanθ > 0. Similarly, tan(16θ) = tan(2*(8θ)) = tan(2θ + 3*360°) = tan(2θ) < 0, and so on. Therefore, the pattern repeats every three steps. Therefore θ = 540/7° is indeed the unique solution.\n\nTherefore, the degree measure of θ is 540/7°, so p=540, q=7, and p+q=547.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{547}\n</think>"}
