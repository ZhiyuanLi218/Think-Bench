The question is about which of the given options does not involve a chemical reaction. The options are A to D. Chemistry is important in human society, so I need to figure out which process here is purely physical rather than chemical.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a chemical reaction is. A chemical reaction involves the transformation of substances into new substances with different chemical properties. In contrast, a physical change involves changes in physical properties without altering the chemical composition.\n\nLooking at option A: Producing biofuel ethanol from discarded straw. I think this involves breaking down the straw (which is plant material, mostly cellulose) into ethanol. That process probably uses fermentation, which is a chemical process where sugars are converted into ethanol and CO2. So that's a chemical reaction.\n\nOption B: Producing plastic and synthetic fibers from petroleum. Petroleum is refined into monomers like ethylene or propylene, which are then polymerized to make plastics and synthetic fibers. Polymerization is definitely a chemical reaction because it forms new chemical bonds to create long chains. So B involves chemical reactions.\n\nOption C: Producing chemical synthetic drugs from basic chemical raw materials. This sounds like synthesizing drugs through chemical processes. For example, making aspirin from salicylic acid and acetic anhydride. That's a chemical reaction as new compounds are formed. So C is a chemical reaction.\n\nOption D: Separating fresh water from seawater using reverse osmosis membranes. Reverse osmosis is a physical separation process. It uses pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, which filters out salts and impurities. The water itself isn't chemically changed; it's just physically separated from the dissolved salts. So this is a physical change, not a chemical reaction.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. It doesn't involve a chemical reaction, just physical separation.\n</think>"}
