The answer should be in the form ax + 2y + c = 0, and then I need to find a + c. Let me start by recalling how to find an angle bisector in a triangle.\n\nFirst, I remember that the angle bisector theorem states that the bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, if I can find where the bisector of angle P meets side QR, then I can determine the equation of the bisector by knowing two points: point P and this intersection point on QR.\n\nLet me write down the coordinates again to be clear:\n\nP = (-8, 5)\n\nQ = (-15, -19)\n\nR = (1, -7)\n\nSo, angle P is at vertex P, between sides PQ and PR. The bisector will intersect QR at some point, say S. According to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of QS to SR is equal to the ratio of PQ to PR.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute the lengths of PQ and PR first.\n\nLet me calculate PQ:\n\nCoordinates of P = (-8, 5), Q = (-15, -19)\n\nDistance PQ = sqrt[ (-15 - (-8))² + (-19 - 5)² ] = sqrt[ (-7)² + (-24)² ] = sqrt[49 + 576] = sqrt[625] = 25.\n\nOkay, that was straightforward. Now PR:\n\nCoordinates of P = (-8, 5), R = (1, -7)\n\nDistance PR = sqrt[ (1 - (-8))² + (-7 - 5)² ] = sqrt[ (9)² + (-12)² ] = sqrt[81 + 144] = sqrt[225] = 15.\n\nSo, PQ is 25 units, PR is 15 units. Therefore, the ratio PQ/PR is 25/15 = 5/3. Therefore, by the angle bisector theorem, QS/SR = 5/3.\n\nTherefore, the point S divides QR in the ratio QS:SR = 5:3.\n\nNow, I need to find the coordinates of point S on QR such that QS/SR = 5/3.\n\nCoordinates of Q = (-15, -19), R = (1, -7). Let me use the section formula here. If a point divides the line segment joining (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in the ratio m:n, then the coordinates of the point are [(m*x2 + n*x1)/(m + n), (m*y2 + n*y1)/(m + n)].\n\nHere, since QS:SR = 5:3, the ratio m:n is 5:3, with Q and R as the endpoints. Therefore, coordinates of S are:\n\nx = (5*1 + 3*(-15)) / (5 + 3) = (5 - 45)/8 = (-40)/8 = -5.\n\ny = (5*(-7) + 3*(-19)) / 8 = (-35 - 57)/8 = (-92)/8 = -11.5 or -23/2.\n\nSo, coordinates of S are (-5, -23/2). Let me confirm this calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the x-coordinate again:\n\n5*1 = 5, 3*(-15) = -45, adding them gives 5 - 45 = -40. Divided by 8: -40/8 = -5. Correct.\n\nFor y-coordinate: 5*(-7) = -35, 3*(-19) = -57, adding gives -35 -57 = -92. Divided by 8: -92/8 = -11.5. Yes, that's -23/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, point S is (-5, -23/2). Now, the angle bisector of angle P is the line joining P(-8,5) and S(-5, -23/2). Therefore, I need to find the equation of the line passing through these two points.\n\nFirst, let me find the slope of PS. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).\n\nSo, m = [(-23/2 - 5)/(-5 - (-8))] = [(-23/2 - 10/2)/ (3)] = [(-33/2)/3] = (-33/2)*(1/3) = -11/2.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nCoordinates of P: (-8, 5)\n\nCoordinates of S: (-5, -23/2)\n\nDifference in y: (-23/2 - 5) = (-23/2 - 10/2) = -33/2\n\nDifference in x: (-5 - (-8)) = (-5 + 8) = 3\n\nTherefore, slope m = (-33/2)/3 = -11/2. Correct.\n\nSo the slope of the angle bisector is -11/2. Now, with point P(-8, 5), let me write the equation of the line.\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nSo, y - 5 = (-11/2)(x - (-8)) => y - 5 = (-11/2)(x + 8)\n\nLet me convert this to standard form ax + 2y + c = 0.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2*(y - 5) = -11*(x + 8)\n\n=> 2y - 10 = -11x - 88\n\nBring all terms to the left-hand side:\n\n11x + 2y - 10 + 88 = 0 => 11x + 2y + 78 = 0\n\nWait, so comparing with ax + 2y + c = 0, we have a = 11 and c = 78. Therefore, a + c = 11 + 78 = 89.\n\nBut let me check if I did the algebra correctly.\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying by 2:\n\n2y - 10 = -11x - 88\n\nAdding 11x and 88 to both sides:\n\n11x + 2y -10 +88 = 0 => 11x + 2y +78 = 0. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut let me verify if this line actually is the angle bisector. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the coordinates of S?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if this line satisfies both points P and S.\n\nFirst, check point P(-8,5):\n\n11*(-8) + 2*(5) + 78 = -88 + 10 + 78 = (-88 + 78) + 10 = -10 + 10 = 0. Correct.\n\nCheck point S(-5, -23/2):\n\n11*(-5) + 2*(-23/2) +78 = -55 -23 +78 = (-55 -23) +78 = -78 +78 = 0. Correct. So the equation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the equation is 11x + 2y +78 = 0, so a =11, c=78. Therefore, a + c = 89.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the equation of the bisector of angle P can be written in the form ax + 2y + c = 0\". Let me check if my equation is in that form. Yes, 11x + 2y +78 = 0. So a is 11, c is 78, so a + c is 89. Therefore, the answer is 89.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to compute the angle bisector? Maybe using vector methods or something else? Let me verify my answer with another method to be safe.\n\nAnother way to find the angle bisector is to use the formula for the internal angle bisector between two lines. However, for that, I need the equations of the two lines forming the angle at P, which are PQ and PR.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find the equations of PQ and PR, then find their angle bisector. Let me try this method as a check.\n\nFirst, find equations of PQ and PR.\n\nFirst, equation of PQ: connects P(-8,5) and Q(-15,-19). We already found the slope earlier when computing the distance. Let me compute the slope again.\n\nSlope of PQ: ( -19 - 5 ) / ( -15 - (-8) ) = (-24)/(-7) = 24/7.\n\nTherefore, equation of PQ: y - 5 = (24/7)(x + 8)\n\nSimilarly, equation of PR: connects P(-8,5) and R(1,-7). Slope is (-7 -5)/(1 - (-8)) = (-12)/9 = -4/3.\n\nEquation of PR: y - 5 = (-4/3)(x + 8)\n\nNow, the angle bisector at P is a line that divides the angle between these two lines. There is a formula for the angle bisector between two lines with known equations.\n\nThe formula for the angle bisector can be found by using the formula that the angle bisector is the locus of points equidistant from both lines. However, since we know the bisector passes through point P, perhaps we can use direction vectors?\n\nAlternatively, there is a formula for the angle bisector between two lines given their slopes.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two lines:\n\nLine 1: PQ with slope m1 = 24/7\n\nLine 2: PR with slope m2 = -4/3\n\nWe can find the angle bisector direction.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the angle bisector in terms of the equations of the two lines.\n\nFirst, let me write equations of PQ and PR in standard form.\n\nEquation of PQ:\n\nStarting from y - 5 = (24/7)(x + 8)\n\nMultiply both sides by 7:\n\n7y - 35 = 24x + 192\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-24x + 7y - 35 - 192 = 0 => -24x + 7y - 227 = 0. Alternatively, multiplying by -1: 24x -7y +227 = 0. Let me check:\n\nOriginal equation: y - 5 = (24/7)(x + 8)\n\nMultiply by 7: 7y - 35 = 24x + 192\n\nRearranged: -24x + 7y - 227 = 0. Correct.\n\nEquation of PR: y - 5 = (-4/3)(x + 8)\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3y - 15 = -4x - 32\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n4x + 3y -15 +32 = 0 => 4x + 3y + 17 = 0. Wait:\n\nOriginal equation: 3y -15 = -4x -32\n\nAdding 4x +32 to both sides:\n\n4x + 3y +17 = 0. Correct.\n\nSo equations:\n\nPQ: -24x + 7y - 227 = 0\n\nPR: 4x + 3y +17 = 0\n\nNow, the angle bisector at P will satisfy the condition that the distance from any point on the bisector to both lines PQ and PR is equal. However, since we know the bisector passes through P(-8,5), maybe we can use direction vectors?\n\nAlternatively, since we already have the bisector passing through P and S(-5, -23/2), which we found earlier, perhaps we can check if this line is indeed the angle bisector by verifying that the angles between the bisector and PQ, PR are equal.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the angle bisector between two lines.\n\nThe formula for the angle bisectors between two lines L1: a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 and L2: a2x + b2y + c2 = 0 is given by:\n\n(a1x + b1y + c1)/sqrt(a1² + b1²) = ±(a2x + b2y + c2)/sqrt(a2² + b2²)\n\nBut since the angle bisector passes through point P(-8,5), which lies on both lines PQ and PR (since they are the sides of the angle), we can use this formula.\n\nHowever, since P is on both lines, c1 and c2 would be zero when expressed in homogeneous form passing through P? Wait, no. Wait, the general formula for angle bisectors between two lines is as above. However, since P is the vertex, we need to adjust the equations so that they pass through P?\n\nWait, actually, the equations of PQ and PR already pass through P, so if we write them in the form a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 and a2x + b2y + c2 = 0, then since P lies on both lines, substituting P into both equations gives 0. Therefore, c1 and c2 can be determined accordingly.\n\nBut in our case, we already have equations of PQ and PR:\n\nPQ: -24x + 7y - 227 = 0\n\nPR: 4x + 3y + 17 = 0\n\nBut let me check if P(-8,5) satisfies both equations:\n\nFor PQ: -24*(-8) +7*5 -227 = 192 + 35 -227 = 227 -227 = 0. Correct.\n\nFor PR: 4*(-8) + 3*5 +17 = -32 +15 +17 = (-32) +32 = 0. Correct. So these are correct.\n\nNow, the angle bisector will satisfy the equation:\n\n(-24x + 7y - 227)/sqrt(24² + 7²) = (4x + 3y +17)/sqrt(4² + 3²)\n\nBut since we are looking for the internal bisector, we need to determine the correct sign. However, since P lies on both lines, substituting P into both sides should give 0. However, since we need the bisector that is between the two lines, we need to figure out the correct sign. Alternatively, since we already have a point S on the bisector, we can check which sign gives the correct line.\n\nAlternatively, let me proceed. Let me compute the denominators:\n\nsqrt(24² + 7²) = sqrt(576 + 49) = sqrt(625) = 25. Which matches the length PQ we calculated earlier. Similarly sqrt(4² + 3²) = 5, which is the length PR divided by 3? Wait PR was 15, which is 3*5. Anyway, moving on.\n\nTherefore, the angle bisector equation is:\n\n(-24x + 7y - 227)/25 = ±(4x + 3y +17)/5\n\nMultiply both sides by 25 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(-24x + 7y - 227) = ±5*(4x + 3y +17)\n\nLet me compute both possibilities:\n\nFirst, with the positive sign:\n\n-24x +7y -227 = 5*(4x +3y +17) => -24x +7y -227 = 20x +15y +85\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-24x -20x +7y -15y -227 -85 = 0 => -44x -8y -312 = 0 => Multiply by -1: 44x +8y +312 = 0. Simplify by dividing by 4: 11x + 2y +78 = 0. Which is exactly the equation we found earlier! So that's the equation with the positive sign. Therefore, this is the correct angle bisector.\n\nWith the negative sign:\n\n-24x +7y -227 = -5*(4x +3y +17) => -24x +7y -227 = -20x -15y -85\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-24x +20x +7y +15y -227 +85 = 0 => -4x +22y -142 = 0 => Simplify: -4x +22y -142 = 0. Let me divide by 2: -2x +11y -71 = 0. Let me check if this line passes through P(-8,5):\n\n-2*(-8) +11*5 -71 = 16 +55 -71 = 71 -71 = 0. Yes, it also passes through P. So there are two angle bisectors: one is 11x +2y +78=0 and another is -2x +11y -71=0. But since we are looking for the internal angle bisector, which one is it?\n\nWell, we already found using the angle bisector theorem that the bisector meets QR at S(-5, -23/2). Let me check if S lies on both lines or only one.\n\nFirst, check if S(-5, -23/2) lies on 11x +2y +78=0:\n\n11*(-5) +2*(-23/2) +78 = -55 -23 +78 = 0. Yes, as before.\n\nCheck if it lies on -2x +11y -71=0:\n\n-2*(-5) +11*(-23/2) -71 = 10 - (253/2) -71. Let me compute:\n\nConvert all to halves:\n\n10 = 20/2, 71 = 142/2.\n\nSo 20/2 -253/2 -142/2 = (20 -253 -142)/2 = (-375)/2 ≠ 0. Therefore, this line is the other angle bisector, the external one. Therefore, our required equation is 11x +2y +78=0, which gives a=11, c=78, so a +c=89. Therefore, the answer is 89.\n\nTherefore, the previous method was correct, and this cross-check confirms it. Therefore, I can be confident that 89 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check another way. For example, compute the unit vectors along PQ and PR, add them, and the resultant vector will be along the angle bisector.\n\nLet me try this method.\n\nFirst, vector PQ: from P to Q is Q - P = (-15 - (-8), -19 -5) = (-7, -24). The length of PQ is 25, as before.\n\nUnit vector in direction PQ: (-7/25, -24/25)\n\nVector PR: from P to R is R - P = (1 - (-8), -7 -5) = (9, -12). Length PR is 15.\n\nUnit vector in direction PR: (9/15, -12/15) = (3/5, -4/5)\n\nThen, the angle bisector direction vector is the sum of these two unit vectors:\n\n(-7/25 + 3/5, -24/25 + (-4/5)) = (-7/25 + 15/25, -24/25 - 20/25) = (8/25, -44/25)\n\nTherefore, direction vector is (8, -44) or simplifying by dividing by 4: (2, -11). Wait, 8/4=2, -44/4=-11. So direction vector (2, -11). Therefore, the angle bisector has direction vector (2, -11). Therefore, slope is -11/2. Which matches the slope we found earlier! Therefore, the slope of the bisector is -11/2. Therefore, using point P(-8,5), the equation is y -5 = (-11/2)(x +8), which is what we had before. Therefore, leading to the same equation 11x +2y +78=0. So this method also confirms it. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is 89.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{89}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{89}\n</think>"}
