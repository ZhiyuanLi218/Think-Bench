Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the floor function does. The floor of a real number x, denoted ⎣x⎦, is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. So, for example, ⎣3.7⎦ is 3, and ⎣5⎦ is 5 because it's already an integer.\n\nNow, the problem is about ⎣log₂n⎦ being a positive even integer. Let me think about what this means. If ⎣log₂n⎦ is some integer k, then that means that k ≤ log₂n < k+1. If I rewrite this inequality in terms of n, it becomes 2^k ≤ n < 2^{k+1}. So for each integer k, the numbers n that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 2^k up to 2^{k+1} - 1.\n\nBut we need ⎣log₂n⎦ to be a positive even integer. So first, let's note that k has to be a positive even integer. Also, since n is a positive integer less than 1000, we need to consider all such k for which the interval [2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1] contains integers less than 1000.\n\nSo first, let's figure out which values of k (positive even integers) are possible here. Let me start by finding the range of possible k.\n\nSince n < 1000, we need to find the maximum k such that 2^{k+1} - 1 < 1000. Let me solve for k here.\n\nLet me compute log₂(1000). Since 2^10 is 1024, which is just over 1000, so log₂(1000) is a little less than 10. So the maximum k for which 2^{k+1} - 1 < 1000 is k=8? Wait, let me check:\n\nIf k=9, then 2^{9} = 512, and 2^{10} = 1024. But if k is the floor of log₂n, then for n up to 1023, floor(log₂n) would be 9. But since n < 1000, the maximum n is 999. Let me check what floor(log₂999) is. Since 2^10 = 1024, log₂999 is less than 10, so floor(log₂999) is 9. Therefore, the possible values of k (floor(log₂n)) for n < 1000 are from 0 up to 9. However, we need k to be a positive even integer. Positive even integers less than or equal to 9 are 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nPositive integers start from 1. So positive even integers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,... But since our maximum k is 9, the possible k values are 2,4,6,8. So four different values of k. For each of these k, we need to count the numbers n in [2^k, 2^{k+1}-1], and then sum them up. But we need to make sure that 2^{k+1}-1 is less than 1000. Wait, but for k=8, 2^{8} is 256, 2^{9} is 512. So the interval would be [256, 511]. Wait, no, for k=8, the interval is [2^8, 2^9 - 1] = [256, 511]. Wait, but 2^{k+1} -1 is 2^9 -1 = 511. Then for k=8, the upper bound is 511, which is less than 1000. Similarly, for k=9, which isn't even, but if we consider k=10, 2^{10} is 1024, so [2^10, 2^11 -1] would be [1024, 2047], but since n < 1000, that interval is outside our range. Therefore, for k=8, the upper bound is 511, so all numbers in that interval are valid. However, for k=9, which is odd, the interval would be [512, 1023], but since n must be less than 1000, if we were to consider k=9, the numbers would be from 512 to 999. However, since k must be even, we don't consider k=9 here.\n\nTherefore, our possible k values are 2,4,6,8, and for each of these, we need to count the numbers in [2^k, 2^{k+1}-1], but for k=8, the upper bound is 511. Wait, but 2^{k+1} -1 for k=8 is 511, which is less than 1000. So all numbers in those intervals are valid. Therefore, for each even k from 2,4,6,8, we can compute the number of integers in each interval and sum them up.\n\nSo let's compute for each k:\n\nFor k=2: [2², 2³ -1] = [4, 7]. The numbers here are 4,5,6,7. That's 7 - 4 + 1 = 4 numbers.\n\nWait, 2^k is 4, 2^{k+1} -1 is 8 -1 = 7. So numbers from 4 to 7 inclusive. So 7 - 4 + 1 = 4 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor k=4: [2^4, 2^5 -1] = [16, 31]. The numbers here are from 16 to 31. The count is 31 - 16 + 1 = 16 numbers.\n\nSimilarly for k=6: [2^6, 2^7 -1] = [64, 127]. The count is 127 - 64 + 1 = 64 numbers.\n\nFor k=8: [2^8, 2^9 -1] = [256, 511]. The count is 511 - 256 + 1. Let me compute that: 511 - 256 = 255, plus 1 is 256 numbers.\n\nSo adding these up: 4 + 16 + 64 + 256. Let me compute that:\n\n4 + 16 is 20, 20 + 64 is 84, 84 + 256 is 340. So total of 340 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I missed something here. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, k=2: numbers from 4 to 7 inclusive. 4,5,6,7. 4 numbers. Correct. So 4.\n\nk=4: 16 to 31. Let me check how many numbers. 31 - 16 + 1. 31 -16 is 15, plus 1 is 16. Correct. 16 numbers.\n\nk=6: 64 to 127. 127 - 64 + 1. 127-64 is 63, plus 1 is 64. Correct. 64 numbers.\n\nk=8: 256 to 511. 511 - 256 +1. 511-256: 511-250 is 261, minus 6 is 255. 255 +1 is 256. Correct. 256 numbers.\n\nAdding them up: 4 + 16 is 20, 20 + 64 is 84, 84 + 256 is 340. So 340 numbers. Therefore, the answer is 340?\n\nWait, but let me check if there is a mistake here. For example, the problem says \"positive integers n\" so n starts at 1. However, for k=0, floor(log₂n)=0 when n is 1, because log₂1=0. But since we need floor(log₂n) to be a positive even integer, k must be positive. Therefore, k=0 is excluded. So our calculation for k=2,4,6,8 is correct because they are positive even integers. Therefore, 340 seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible even k. For example, k=10. If k=10, then the interval would be [2^10, 2^11 -1] = [1024, 2047]. But since n < 1000, there are no numbers in this interval. Therefore, k=10 is excluded. Similarly, negative k? No, since n is positive integer, log₂n is defined and for n ≥1, log₂n ≥0. So k is non-negative. But since we need positive even integers, k must be 2,4,6,8,... So only up to 8 here. So 340 is the total.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's think about how many numbers have floor(log₂n) equal to each even k, and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. For each k, the number of integers n with floor(log₂n)=k is 2^k. Wait, for k≥0, except for the last interval which might be cut off. Wait, normally, for each k, the number of integers n with floor(log₂n)=k is 2^k, because 2^{k+1} - 2^k = 2^k. However, when the upper bound is limited (like n < 1000), then for the highest k, the count might be less.\n\nBut in our case, for k=2,4,6,8, the intervals [2^k, 2^{k+1}-1] are all entirely below 1000. For example, for k=8, 2^{k+1}-1=511 < 1000. Therefore, each of these k's contribute 2^k numbers. Let me check:\n\nFor k=2: 2^2 = 4 numbers. Which matches our previous count.\n\nk=4: 2^4 = 16 numbers. Correct.\n\nk=6: 2^6=64 numbers. Correct.\n\nk=8: 2^8=256 numbers. Correct.\n\nTherefore, adding them up: 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 = 340. Same result. So that seems solid.\n\nBut let me check with another angle. Let me compute total numbers where floor(log₂n) is even. Let me think about all n from 1 to 999, and categorize them based on floor(log₂n). Let me list all possible k values and see which ones are even.\n\nAs mentioned before, floor(log₂n) can be from 0 up to 9, since 2^10=1024>1000.\n\nSo k=0: n=1 (since log₂1=0, floor is 0). The interval [1,1]. But k=0 is not positive, so excluded.\n\nk=1: [2^1, 2^2 -1] = [2,3]. Numbers 2,3. Count 2. k=1 is odd.\n\nk=2: [4,7]. Count 4. Even k.\n\nk=3: [8,15]. Count 8. Odd k.\n\nk=4: [16,31]. Count 16. Even k.\n\nk=5: [32,63]. Count 32. Odd k.\n\nk=6: [64,127]. Count 64. Even k.\n\nk=7: [128,255]. Count 128-64=128? Wait 255 - 128 +1= 128 numbers. Wait 255 - 128 is 127, plus 1 is 128. Correct. k=7 is odd.\n\nk=8: [256, 511]. Count 256 numbers. Even k.\n\nk=9: [512, 1023]. But since n < 1000, we have to adjust. The original interval is [512, 1023], but n must be less than 1000. Therefore, numbers from 512 to 999. How many numbers is that? 999 - 512 +1 = 488 numbers. But k=9 is odd, so even though we have numbers here, since k=9 is odd, we don't count them. Therefore, only the even k's contribute. So for even k=2,4,6,8, the counts are 4,16,64,256. Adding up to 340. Therefore, the answer is 340.\n\nBut let me check once more. For example, total numbers from 1 to 999: 999 numbers. Let me check if the sum over all k of counts equals 999.\n\nFor k=0: 1\n\nk=1: 2\n\nk=2:4\n\nk=3:8\n\nk=4:16\n\nk=5:32\n\nk=6:64\n\nk=7:128\n\nk=8:256\n\nk=9: 488 ?\n\nWait let me check the counts for k from 0 to 9:\n\nTotal numbers should be sum_{k=0}^9 (count for k). For k=0 to 8, the counts are 2^k, and for k=9, it's 999 - 2^9 +1 ?\n\nWait, 2^9 is 512. The numbers for k=9 would normally be from 512 to 1023, which is 1024 numbers (from 512 to 1023 inclusive is 1023 - 512 + 1 = 512 numbers). Wait, 1023 - 512 + 1 = 512. But since n < 1000, we have numbers from 512 to 999. Let me calculate how many numbers that is: 999 - 512 + 1 = 488. Therefore, for k=9, instead of 512 numbers, we have 488 numbers.\n\nTherefore, total numbers would be:\n\nsum_{k=0}^8 2^k + 488.\n\nBut sum_{k=0}^8 2^k is 2^9 -1 = 512 -1 = 511. Then adding 488 gives 511 + 488 = 999. Correct. Therefore, our counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the counts for even k's are:\n\nk=2: 4, k=4:16, k=6:64, k=8:256. Total 4+16+64+256=340. Therefore, the answer is 340. Therefore, I think this is correct.\n\nBut let me check with specific examples. For example, take n=4. floor(log2(4))=2, which is even. Included. n=5, same. Up to 7. Then n=8: floor(log2(8))=3, which is odd, so excluded. Then n=16: floor(log2(16))=4, even, included. So between 16 and 31, they are included. Then from 32 to 63, excluded, etc. So seems correct.\n\nAnother check: For numbers between 512 and 999, floor(log2(n)) is 9, which is odd, so they are excluded. Correct. So our calculation seems right.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 340. Therefore, the number of positive integers n less than 1000 where floor(log2(n)) is a positive even integer is 340.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of such positive integers $ n $ is \\boxed{340}.\n</think>"}
