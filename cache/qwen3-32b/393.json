So atom economy is about maximizing the incorporation of all reactant atoms into the product, right? That means ideally, there are no by-products or waste.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: The reaction of acetylene prepared from calcium carbide and water. I remember that calcium carbide (CaC2) reacts with water (H2O) to produce acetylene gas (C2H2) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). The equation is CaC2 + 2H2O → C2H2 + Ca(OH)2. So here, the products are acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But if the desired product is acetylene, then calcium hydroxide is a by-product. That means not all atoms from the reactants go into the desired product. So this reaction isn't ideal in terms of atom economy. So maybe A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: The reaction of ethyl bromide with ethanol solution of NaOH to prepare ethylene by heating. This sounds like an elimination reaction. Ethyl bromide (C2H5Br) reacting with NaOH in ethanol would undergo dehydrohalogenation. The reaction would produce ethylene (C2H4), water (H2O), and sodium bromide (NaBr). The equation would be something like C2H5Br + NaOH → C2H4 + NaBr + H2O. Again, here the desired product is ethylene, but there are other products like NaBr and H2O. So again, not all atoms from the reactants are in the desired product. So B might not be the best either.\n\nOption C: The reaction of phenol dilute solution with saturated bromine water to prepare 2,4,6-tribromophenol. Phenol (C6H5OH) reacting with bromine (Br2) in water. I think phenol is very reactive towards electrophilic substitution, so bromine will substitute three hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring. The reaction is C6H5OH + 3Br2 → C6H2Br3OH + 3HBr. So the desired product is 2,4,6-tribromophenol, and HBr is a by-product. So here, HBr is a by-product. Therefore, not all atoms go into the desired product. So C might not be ideal either.\n\nOption D: The reaction of ethylene with oxygen to prepare ethylene oxide under Ag catalysis. Ethylene oxide is a cyclic ether. The reaction is probably a catalytic oxidation. The equation would be 2C2H4 + O2 → 2C2H4O. So ethylene and oxygen react to form ethylene oxide. Let me check the stoichiometry. If two moles of ethylene react with one mole of oxygen to produce two moles of ethylene oxide. In this case, all the atoms from ethylene and oxygen are incorporated into ethylene oxide. There are no by-products. So this seems like a perfect atom economy reaction because all the reactants are converted into the desired product. So D might be the correct answer.\n\nLet me verify each again. For A: CaC2 + H2O gives C2H2 and Ca(OH)2. So by-product is Ca(OH)2. Not ideal. B: Ethyl bromide and NaOH gives ethylene, NaBr, and H2O. By-products. C: Phenol and Br2 gives tribromophenol and HBr. By-product. D: Ethylene and O2 gives ethylene oxide. No by-products. So D is the one where all atoms from reactants go into the product. Hence, the answer should be D.\n</think>"}
