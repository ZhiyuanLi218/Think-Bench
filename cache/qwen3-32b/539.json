The problem says the plates are charged to a potential difference of 5 volts, and the capacitance is 2 millifarads. The options are A through D, and I have to pick the right one. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that capacitors store electric charge, and there's a formula that relates charge, capacitance, and voltage. I think the formula is Q equals C times V, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think that's right. The basic formula for a capacitor is Q = CV. So if I can plug in the values given here, I should be able to find the charge.\n\nBut wait, the capacitance here is given in millifarads. The standard unit for capacitance in the formula is farads, right? So I need to convert millifarads to farads. Let me recall that \"milli\" means one-thousandth. So 1 millifarad is 0.001 farads. Therefore, 2 millifarads would be 2 times 0.001, which is 0.002 farads. Let me write that down:\n\nC = 2 mF = 2 × 10⁻³ F = 0.002 F.\n\nAnd the voltage is given as 5 volts. So plugging into the formula Q = CV:\n\nQ = 0.002 F × 5 V.\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.002 multiplied by 5. Hmm, 0.002 times 5 is 0.01. So Q equals 0.01 coulombs. Let me check the options again. Option B is 0.01 C. So that should be the answer. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, unit conversion: 2 mF to farads. Yes, 1 mF = 1e-3 F, so 2 mF is 0.002 F. Correct. Then multiplying by 5 volts: 0.002 * 5. Let me do the math again. 0.002 is 2 thousandths. 2 thousandths times 5 is 10 thousandths, which is 0.01. Yep, that's right. So 0.01 coulombs is the charge. So answer B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula is indeed Q = CV. Sometimes I might confuse it with other formulas. For a capacitor, capacitance is defined as the ability to store charge per unit voltage. So C = Q/V, which rearranged gives Q = CV. Yes, that's correct. So the formula is right. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer should be B: 0.01 C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here? Like, sometimes capacitors in series or parallel? But the question doesn't mention any other capacitors, so it's just a single capacitor. So no need to consider combinations. The given capacitance is 2 mF, so that's straightforward. So I think my answer is correct. Answer B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
