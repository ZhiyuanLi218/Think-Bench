I need to figure out how many treeks weigh the same as one squig. The problem gives me two equations involving treeks, squigs, and goolees. Hmm, let me write them down to keep track.\n\nFirst, it says ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. So, if I let T be the weight of a treek, S for squig, and G for goolee, that would be:\n\n10T = 3S + G\n\nThen the second part says two treeks and one goolee equal one squig. So that's:\n\n2T + G = S\n\nAlright, so I need to find how many treeks equal one squig. In other words, find x such that xT = S. So maybe I can solve these equations to find S in terms of T?\n\nLet me start with the second equation because it seems simpler. From 2T + G = S, maybe I can express G in terms of S and T? Let me try that.\n\nIf I rearrange the second equation:\n\nG = S - 2T\n\nOkay, so now I can substitute this expression for G into the first equation. The first equation is 10T = 3S + G. Let me replace G with (S - 2T):\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\nLet me simplify the right side. 3S + S is 4S, and then minus 2T. So:\n\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\nNow, let me get all the T terms on one side. Let me add 2T to both sides:\n\n10T + 2T = 4S\n\nWhich is 12T = 4S\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4:\n\n3T = S\n\nWait, so that would mean that one squig weighs the same as three treeks? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1) 10T = 3S + G\n\n2) 2T + G = S\n\nFrom equation 2: G = S - 2T. Substitute into equation 1:\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T) => 10T = 4S - 2T => 12T = 4S => 3T = S. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo according to this, one squig equals three treeks. Therefore, the combined weight of 3 treeks equals one squig. Let me just verify with an example to make sure.\n\nSuppose a treek weighs 1 unit. Then S = 3 units. Then G would be S - 2T = 3 - 2(1) = 1 unit. Let's check the first equation: 10T = 10*1 = 10. On the other side, 3S + G = 3*3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. Yep, that works. And the second equation: 2T + G = 2*1 + 1 = 3, which is equal to S. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nSo the answer is 3 treeks. Therefore, the combined weight of 3 treeks equals one squig.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe combined weight of \\boxed{3} treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>"}
