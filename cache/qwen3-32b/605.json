Let me start by writing down the equation properly:\n\n$x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x - 2005 = 0$.\n\nFirst, I notice that the left-hand side before the 2005 looks similar to the expansion of $(x - 1)^4$. Let me check that. The expansion of $(x - 1)^4$ is:\n\n$x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1$.\n\nOh, interesting! The given polynomial is almost like $(x - 1)^4 - 1 - 2005 = 0$, which simplifies to $(x - 1)^4 - 2006 = 0$. Wait, let me verify:\n\nOriginal equation: $x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x = 2005$. If I add 1 to both sides, I get:\n\n$x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 = 2006$.\n\nWhich is indeed $(x - 1)^4 = 2006$. So, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$(x - 1)^4 = 2006$.\n\nTherefore, taking the fourth root of both sides, we get:\n\n$x - 1 = \\sqrt[4]{2006}$, but considering all fourth roots, including complex ones.\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\n$x = 1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}$, $x = 1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}$, $x = 1 + i\\sqrt[4]{2006}$, and $x = 1 - i\\sqrt[4]{2006}$.\n\nWait, but hold on. The fourth roots of 2006 are four in total. Since 2006 is a positive real number, its fourth roots are:\n\n- The positive real fourth root: $\\sqrt[4]{2006}$,\n- The negative real fourth root: $-\\sqrt[4]{2006}$,\n- And two complex fourth roots: $i\\sqrt[4]{2006}$ and $-i\\sqrt[4]{2006}$.\n\nTherefore, the four roots of the equation $(x - 1)^4 = 2006$ are indeed the ones I listed above.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the product of the nonreal roots. Let me identify which roots are nonreal. The roots are:\n\n1. $1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}$ – real\n2. $1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}$ – real\n3. $1 + i\\sqrt[4]{2006}$ – nonreal\n4. $1 - i\\sqrt[4]{2006}$ – nonreal\n\nTherefore, the nonreal roots are numbers 3 and 4. Let me compute their product.\n\nLet me denote $a = \\sqrt[4]{2006}$. Then the nonreal roots are $1 + ia$ and $1 - ia$. Their product is:\n\n$(1 + ia)(1 - ia) = 1^2 - (ia)^2 = 1 - (-a^2) = 1 + a^2$.\n\nSince $a = \\sqrt[4]{2006}$, then $a^2 = \\sqrt{2006}$. Therefore, the product is:\n\n$1 + \\sqrt{2006}$.\n\nTherefore, $P = 1 + \\sqrt{2006}$. Now, the question asks for $\\lfloor P \\rfloor$, the floor of P. So I need to compute the integer part of $1 + \\sqrt{2006}$.\n\nFirst, let me compute $\\sqrt{2006}$. Let me find between which two squares 2006 lies. Let me recall that:\n\n$44^2 = 1936$,\n$45^2 = 2025$.\n\nYes, because 44^2 = (40 + 4)^2 = 1600 + 320 + 16 = 1936, and 45^2 = 2025. Therefore, sqrt(2006) is between 44 and 45.\n\nLet me compute 44.8^2:\n\n44.8^2 = (44 + 0.8)^2 = 44^2 + 2*44*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 1936 + 70.4 + 0.64 = 1936 + 70.4 is 2006.4 + 0.64? Wait, no:\n\nWait 1936 + 70.4 = 2006.4? Wait 1936 + 70 is 2006, so 1936 + 70.4 = 2006.4. Then adding 0.64 gives 2006.4 + 0.64 = 2007.04. But 44.8^2 = 2007.04. But 2006 is less than that. Therefore, sqrt(2006) is less than 44.8.\n\nLet me try 44.7^2:\n\n44.7^2 = (44.8 - 0.1)^2 = 44.8^2 - 2*44.8*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 2007.04 - 8.96 + 0.01 = 2007.04 - 8.96 is 1998.08 + 0.01 = 1998.09. Wait, that seems too low. Wait, no, maybe my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, no, let me recalculate 44.7^2 properly:\n\nLet me compute 44*44.7 + 0.7*44.7?\n\nWait, maybe better to do (a - b)^2 where a = 45, b = 0.3:\n\nWait 44.7 = 45 - 0.3. Therefore:\n\n(45 - 0.3)^2 = 45^2 - 2*45*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 2025 - 27 + 0.09 = 2025 - 27 is 1998 + 0.09 = 1998.09. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, 44.7^2 = 1998.09, which is less than 2006. So sqrt(2006) is between 44.7 and 44.8.\n\nCompute 44.7^2 = 1998.09\n\nDifference between 2006 and 1998.09 is 2006 - 1998.09 = 7.91.\n\nNow, let's try to approximate sqrt(2006). Let me use linear approximation between 44.7 and 44.8.\n\nLet me denote x = 44.7, f(x) = x^2 = 1998.09.\n\nWe need to find delta such that (x + delta)^2 = 2006.\n\nExpanding, x^2 + 2x*delta + delta^2 = 2006.\n\nAssuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible, so approximate:\n\n2x*delta ≈ 2006 - x^2 = 7.91 => delta ≈ 7.91 / (2x) = 7.91 / (2*44.7) ≈ 7.91 / 89.4 ≈ approx 0.0885.\n\nTherefore, approximate sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.7 + 0.0885 ≈ 44.7885.\n\nLet me check 44.7885^2:\n\nFirst, compute 44.7^2 = 1998.09 as before.\n\nNow, 44.7 + 0.0885 = 44.7885. Let me compute (44.7 + 0.0885)^2:\n\n= 44.7^2 + 2*44.7*0.0885 + (0.0885)^2\n\n≈ 1998.09 + 2*44.7*0.0885 + negligible term.\n\nCompute 2*44.7*0.0885:\n\nFirst, 44.7 * 0.0885.\n\nLet me compute 44.7 * 0.0885:\n\nWell, 44.7 * 0.08 = 3.576,\n\n44.7 * 0.0085 = ?\n\nFirst, 44.7 * 0.01 = 0.447, so 0.0085 is 0.85 * 0.01, so 0.85 * 0.447 ≈ 0.37995.\n\nTherefore total approx 3.576 + 0.37995 ≈ 3.95595.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 2 gives approx 7.9119.\n\nTherefore, total approx 1998.09 + 7.9119 ≈ 2006.0019. Wow, that's really close! So my approximation of delta ≈ 0.0885 gives me a value whose square is approximately 2006.0019, which is very close to 2006. Therefore, sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.7 + 0.0885 ≈ 44.7885. Therefore, sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.7885.\n\nTherefore, P = 1 + sqrt(2006) ≈ 1 + 44.7885 ≈ 45.7885. Therefore, the floor of P is 45. Therefore, the answer is 45. But let me check if my approximation is correct, because if sqrt(2006) is slightly less than 44.7885, maybe my floor is still 45. But given that my approximation gives 44.7885 and the square is already 2006.0019, which is just a bit over. Therefore, the actual sqrt(2006) is a bit less than 44.7885. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote that with delta ≈ 0.0885, the square is 2006.0019. Therefore, to get exactly 2006, we need to subtract a tiny bit from delta. Let me denote that sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.7 + delta - epsilon, where epsilon is small. Therefore, the actual value is slightly less than 44.7885, but how much?\n\nLet me compute the exact difference. Let me take x = 44.7 + 0.0885 = 44.7885. Then x^2 = 2006.0019 as above. Therefore, to find the exact sqrt(2006), we need to find x such that x^2 = 2006. Let me use linear approximation again around x = 44.7885.\n\nLet me let f(x) = x^2. We have f(x) = 2006.0019 at x = 44.7885. Let me find the value of x where f(x) = 2006. Let me denote that x = 44.7885 - ε, where ε is small.\n\nThen f(x) ≈ f(44.7885) - 2*44.7885 * ε = 2006.0019 - 89.577 * ε.\n\nSet this equal to 2006:\n\n2006.0019 - 89.577 * ε ≈ 2006 => 0.0019 ≈ 89.577 * ε => ε ≈ 0.0019 / 89.577 ≈ 0.0000212.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.7885 - 0.0000212 ≈ 44.7884788. Therefore, sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.7884788. Therefore, P = 1 + sqrt(2006) ≈ 45.7884788. Therefore, the floor of P is 45, since the decimal part is less than 1. Therefore, $\\lfloor P \\rfloor = 45$.\n\nBut wait, let me check again if there's another way to do this problem, maybe using Vieta's formula or something else, to confirm my answer.\n\nOriginal equation: $x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x - 2005 = 0$. We rewrote it as $(x - 1)^4 = 2006$. So, the roots are as I mentioned. Therefore, nonreal roots are $1 + i\\sqrt[4]{2006}$ and $1 - i\\sqrt[4]{2006}$, whose product is $1 + \\sqrt{2006}$. Therefore, P is indeed $1 + \\sqrt{2006}$. Therefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the quartic equation can be written as $(x - 1)^4 - 2006 = 0$, maybe I could have used Vieta's formula. But since we already have the roots, this seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I didn't notice the quartic is a bionomial expansion. Let me try to think if there is another way. Let me check the original equation:\n\nOriginal equation is $x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x = 2005$. Let me note that the left-hand side is similar to the expansion of (x - 1)^4 except for the constant term. So, if I consider the polynomial $x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 = (x - 1)^4$. Therefore, if I subtract 1, I get the original left-hand side. Therefore, original equation is $(x - 1)^4 - 1 = 2005 + 1 = 2006$. Therefore, $(x - 1)^4 = 2006$. So same conclusion. Therefore, my previous reasoning holds.\n\nTherefore, P is 1 + sqrt(2006). Therefore, floor of that is 45. Therefore, answer is 45. But to make sure, let me compute sqrt(2006) more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 44.78^2:\n\nFirst, 44^2 = 1936.\n\nCompute 44.78^2:\n\nLet me write 44.78 as 44 + 0.78.\n\n(44 + 0.78)^2 = 44^2 + 2*44*0.78 + 0.78^2 = 1936 + 68.64 + 0.6084 = 1936 + 68.64 is 2004.64 + 0.6084 is 2005.2484.\n\nSo, 44.78^2 = 2005.2484 < 2006.\n\nNow compute 44.79^2:\n\nSimilarly, 44.79 = 44.78 + 0.01.\n\nSo, (44.78 + 0.01)^2 = 44.78^2 + 2*44.78*0.01 + 0.01^2 = 2005.2484 + 0.8956 + 0.0001 = 2005.2484 + 0.8956 = 2006.144 + 0.0001 = 2006.1441.\n\nTherefore, 44.79^2 ≈ 2006.1441 > 2006. Therefore, sqrt(2006) is between 44.78 and 44.79.\n\nCompute the exact value:\n\nLet me denote that between 44.78 and 44.79, let me find how much.\n\nLet me let x = 44.78 + d, where 0 < d < 0.01, such that x^2 = 2006.\n\nWe have:\n\n(44.78 + d)^2 = 2005.2484 + 2*44.78*d + d^2 = 2005.2484 + 89.56*d + d^2 = 2006.\n\nTherefore, 89.56*d ≈ 2006 - 2005.2484 = 0.7516.\n\nTherefore, d ≈ 0.7516 / 89.56 ≈ Let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, 0.7516 / 89.56 ≈ 0.7516 / 89.56 ≈ approx 0.00839.\n\nTherefore, d ≈ 0.00839. Therefore, sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.78 + 0.00839 ≈ 44.78839.\n\nWhich matches my previous approximation of approximately 44.7885. Therefore, sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.7884, so P = 1 + sqrt(2006) ≈ 45.7884. Therefore, floor(P) is 45. Hence, the answer is 45.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute sqrt(2006) more accurately? Let me try with another iteration.\n\nWe had x = 44.78 + 0.00839 ≈ 44.78839. Let me compute x^2:\n\nFirst, 44.78^2 = 2005.2484.\n\nNow, adding 2*44.78*0.00839 + (0.00839)^2.\n\nFirst term: 2*44.78*0.00839 ≈ 89.56 * 0.00839 ≈ Let me compute 89.56 * 0.008 = 0.71648, and 89.56 * 0.00039 ≈ approx 0.0349. So total approx 0.71648 + 0.0349 ≈ 0.75138. Which is very close to the 0.7516 we needed. Therefore, x^2 ≈ 2005.2484 + 0.75138 + negligible ≈ 2005.2484 + 0.75138 ≈ 2005.99978, which is almost 2006. Therefore, sqrt(2006) ≈ 44.78 + 0.00839 ≈ 44.78839. Therefore, P = 1 + 44.78839 ≈ 45.78839. Therefore, floor(P) is 45. So, definitely, the floor is 45.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 45.\n\nBut let me check once again if there is any mistake in assuming that the nonreal roots are conjugates and their product is 1 + sqrt(2006). Let me verify.\n\nGiven that the original equation is a quartic with real coefficients, so complex roots come in conjugate pairs. Therefore, if there are two nonreal roots, they must be conjugates. Therefore, their product is |z|^2, where z is one of them. Let me compute |z|^2 for z = 1 + i*a, where a = \\sqrt[4]{2006}.\n\n|z|^2 = (1)^2 + (a)^2 = 1 + a^2. Which is exactly what I computed earlier. Since a^2 = sqrt(2006), then |z|^2 = 1 + sqrt(2006). Therefore, yes, the product of nonreal roots is indeed 1 + sqrt(2006). Therefore, my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{45}\n</think>"}
