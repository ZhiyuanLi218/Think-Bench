That sounds a bit complicated, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense. Let me write it out again to visualize better:\n\n√[ ( (5 / √80) + (√845 / 9) + √45 ) / √5 ]\n\nAlright, so first, maybe I should simplify each term inside the numerator before dealing with the denominator √5. Let me take them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 / √80. Hmm, denominators with square roots can be rationalized. Let me recall how to do that. Multiply numerator and denominator by √80 to get rid of the square root in the denominator. But maybe before that, can I simplify √80? Let me see: 80 factors into 16 * 5, and since 16 is a perfect square, √80 = √(16*5) = 4√5. So, √80 is 4√5. Therefore, 5 / √80 becomes 5 / (4√5). Then, rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √5:\n\n(5 * √5) / (4√5 * √5) = (5√5) / (4 * 5) = (5√5)/20. The 5 cancels out with the denominator 20, giving √5 / 4. So the first term simplifies to √5 / 4. Okay, that seems manageable.\n\nMoving on to the second term: √845 / 9. Let me simplify √845. Let me factor 845. Hmm, 845 divided by 5 is 169. So 845 = 5 * 169. And 169 is 13 squared. Therefore, √845 = √(5 * 13²) = 13√5. Therefore, √845 / 9 becomes 13√5 / 9. Got that. So the second term is (13√5)/9.\n\nThird term is √45. Let me simplify that. 45 factors into 9 * 5, which is 3² * 5. Therefore, √45 = 3√5. So the third term is 3√5.\n\nSo now, putting all three simplified terms back into the numerator of the big fraction:\n\n(√5 / 4) + (13√5 / 9) + 3√5.\n\nNow, since all terms have √5, maybe I can factor that out? Let me try:\n\n√5 [ 1/4 + 13/9 + 3 ].\n\nWait, let me check that. The third term is 3√5, so if I factor out √5, that would be √5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). But 3 is 3/1, right? So yes. So now I need to compute the sum inside the brackets: 1/4 + 13/9 + 3.\n\nLet me compute that. First, convert all terms to fractions with common denominators. Let me find the least common denominator (LCD) of 4, 9, and 1. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The LCD of 4 and 9 is 36, since they are coprime. So let me convert each term:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = (13 * 4)/36 = 52/36,\n\n3 = 3/1 = (3 * 36)/36 = 108/36.\n\nAdding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36.\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n9 + 52 is 61, then 61 + 108 is 169. So total is 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the entire numerator simplifies to √5 * (169/36).\n\nTherefore, going back to the original expression:\n\n√ [ (numerator) / √5 ] = √ [ (√5 * 169/36) / √5 ].\n\nWait, so the numerator is √5*(169/36), and then we divide that by √5. Let me compute that fraction first.\n\n(√5 * 169/36) divided by √5. Dividing by √5 is same as multiplying by 1/√5. Therefore:\n\n(√5 * 169/36) * (1 / √5) = (169 / 36) * (√5 / √5) = 169/36 * 1 = 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to √(169/36). Now, square root of a fraction is square root of numerator over square root of denominator. √169 is 13, √36 is 6. Therefore, √(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nWait, so is that the final answer? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst term: 5 / √80. Simplify √80 to 4√5, so 5 / 4√5, rationalize to √5 / 4. Correct.\n\nSecond term: √845. 845 is 5*169, which is 5*13². So √845 is 13√5. Divided by 9, so 13√5 / 9. Correct.\n\nThird term: √45 is 3√5. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: √5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Converting to 36 denominator:\n\n1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, 3 is 108/36. Total 169/36. Multiply by √5. Then divide by √5, cancels out. Then square root of 169/36 is 13/6. Seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the arithmetic again. Let me verify the sum 1/4 + 13/9 + 3.\n\nFirst, 1/4 is 0.25, 13/9 is approximately 1.444..., and 3 is 3. Adding them up: 0.25 + 1.444... = 1.694..., plus 3 is 4.694...\n\nNow, 169 divided by 36 is approximately 4.694... since 36*4=144, 36*4.694≈ 36*4 + 36*0.694≈144 + 24.98≈168.98≈169. Correct. So the fraction 169/36 is correct.\n\nTherefore, square root of that is 13/6. Since 13 squared is 169 and 6 squared is 36. Correct. So the final simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nWait, but let me check if the entire original expression was correctly interpreted. The original problem is:\n\n√[ ( (5 / √80) + (√845 / 9) + √45 ) / √5 ]\n\nYes, so first compute numerator terms, add them, then divide by √5, then take the square root. Which is exactly what I did. So seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach it? Let me try another method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combine all terms over a common denominator before simplifying? Let me see.\n\nBut maybe that would be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe rationalize each term and then combine?\n\nBut I think my first approach was correct. Let me just verify once again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n√ [ (A + B + C) / D ] where A = 5 / √80, B = √845 / 9, C = √45, D = √5.\n\nSimplify A: 5 / √80 = √5 / 4.\n\nSimplify B: √845 / 9 = 13√5 / 9.\n\nSimplify C: √45 = 3√5.\n\nTherefore, A + B + C = √5 / 4 + 13√5 / 9 + 3√5. Factor out √5:\n\n√5 [ 1/4 + 13/9 + 3 ].\n\nConvert to fractions:\n\nAs above, 1/4 + 13/9 + 3 = 169/36. Then, A + B + C = √5 * 169 / 36.\n\nDivide by D = √5: (√5 * 169 / 36) / √5 = 169 / 36.\n\nTake square root: √(169 / 36) = 13 / 6.\n\nYes, same result. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nTherefore, I think that is the correct answer. Let me check once more if 13/6 is in simplest form. 13 is a prime number, 6 is 2*3. No common factors, so yes, 13/6 is reduced completely.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified fraction is \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{6}}.\n</think>"}
