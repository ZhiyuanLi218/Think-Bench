Let me start by recalling what a strong electrolyte is. From what I remember, a strong electrolyte is a substance that completely dissociates into ions when dissolved in water, allowing the solution to conduct electricity well. Strong acids, strong bases, and soluble salts are typically strong electrolytes. Weak electrolytes, on the other hand, only partially dissociate, like weak acids and bases. Non-electrolytes don't dissociate at all.\n\nLooking at the options given: (A) HCOOH, (B) Fe, (C) Na₂CO₃, (D) C₂H₂. Let's go through each one.\n\nStarting with option A, HCOOH. That's formic acid, right? I think formic acid is a weak acid. Weak acids are weak electrolytes because they don't fully dissociate in water. So HCOOH would be a weak electrolyte, not a strong one. So A is probably not the correct answer.\n\nOption B is Fe. Iron is a metal, so it's an element. Electrolytes are substances that produce ions in solution. But Fe as a metal would conduct electricity in its solid form, but when dissolved? Wait, iron is a metal, but does it act as an electrolyte? I think metals are conductors in the solid state, but electrolytes are about solutions. If you have solid iron, it's a conductor, but if you dissolve it, like in some acid maybe, it would form ions. But Fe by itself isn't an electrolyte because it's a pure metal. Unless it's in a molten state or part of a solution. But the question doesn't specify. Typically, when talking about electrolytes in aqueous solutions, Fe metal isn't dissolved as ions. So maybe Fe isn't an electrolyte. So B is probably not a strong electrolyte.\n\nOption C is Na₂CO₃. Sodium carbonate. I think sodium carbonate is a soluble salt. Sodium is a group 1 metal, so its salts are usually soluble. Carbonate salts of group 1 metals are soluble. So when dissolved in water, Na₂CO₃ would dissociate into 2 Na⁺ ions and a CO₃²⁻ ion. Since it's a soluble salt, it should be a strong electrolyte because it completely dissociates. So C is likely a strong electrolyte.\n\nOption D is C₂H₂, which is acetylene. Acetylene is a hydrocarbon, a covalent compound. Covalent compounds generally don't dissociate into ions in water, so they are non-electrolytes. Unless they can ionize somehow. But acetylene is a hydrocarbon; it doesn't have ions. So it's a non-electrolyte. Therefore, D is not a strong electrolyte.\n\nSo among the options, only C (Na₂CO₃) is a strong electrolyte. Let me double-check each one to be sure.\n\nHCOOH is formic acid, which is a weak acid, so weak electrolyte. Correct. Fe is a metal, not an electrolyte. Na₂CO₃ is a soluble salt, so strong electrolyte. C₂H₂ is a non-electrolyte. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>"}
