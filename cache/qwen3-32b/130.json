Let me recall what I know about this. The system is described by the differential equation:\n\nm * d²x/dt² + γ * dx/dt + kx = F₀ cos(Ωt)\n\nRight? And the steady-state solution is given as x = B cos(Ωt - φ). I need to find B and φ. \n\nFirst, I remember that for a driven harmonic oscillator, the amplitude B can be found using the formula:\n\nB = F₀ / sqrt[(k - mΩ²)² + (γΩ)²]\n\nAnd the phase angle φ is given by:\n\nφ = arctan[γΩ / (k - mΩ²)]\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful about the signs here. Depending on whether the denominator is positive or negative, the phase angle might be in a different quadrant. Let me make sure I have the right formula.\n\nYes, since the driving force is F₀ cos(Ωt), the phase angle φ is the phase lag of the displacement relative to the driving force. The formula for φ is indeed arctangent of (γΩ / (k - mΩ²)). But depending on the values, I might need to adjust the arctangent result to the correct quadrant.\n\nAlright, so let me plug in the numbers. Let me note down the given values:\n\nm = 0.2 kg\n\nk = 80 N/m\n\nγ = 4 Ns/m\n\nF₀ = 2 N\n\nΩ = 30 s⁻¹\n\nSo first, compute the terms in the denominator for B. Let's compute k - mΩ² first.\n\nLet me calculate mΩ²:\n\nm = 0.2 kg, Ω = 30 s⁻¹, so mΩ² = 0.2 * (30)^2 = 0.2 * 900 = 180 N/m? Wait, units? Well, m has units kg, Ω² is s⁻², so mΩ² has units kg/s². But when we subtract from k which is N/m, which is kg/s² as well because 1 N/m = 1 kg/s². So units are consistent.\n\nSo k - mΩ² = 80 - 180 = -100 kg/s².\n\nThen γΩ is 4 * 30 = 120 Ns/m * s⁻¹? Wait, γ has units Ns/m, which is (kg/s) * s/m? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nDamping coefficient γ has units of Ns/m. Let me verify:\n\nIn the differential equation, the term γ dx/dt has units of N, since it's added to m d²x/dt² and kx. So γ [Ns/m] * dx/dt [m/s] = Ns/m * m/s = N. Correct. So γ has units Ns/m.\n\nTherefore, γΩ has units (Ns/m) * (s⁻¹) = Ns²/m. Wait, but in the denominator of B's formula, we have sqrt[(k - mΩ²)^2 + (γΩ)^2]. The term (k - mΩ²) is kg/s², as discussed. The term γΩ is Ns/m * 1/s? Wait, Ω is in rad/s, which is equivalent to s⁻¹. So γΩ is (Ns/m) * s⁻¹ = N/(m*s). Wait, but N is kg*m/s², so substituting:\n\nγΩ has units (kg*m/s² * s / m) * 1/s? Wait, maybe I need to recast:\n\nγ has units Ns/m = (kg·m/s²)(s)/m = kg/s. So γΩ has units kg/s * 1/s = kg/s². Which matches with the units of k - mΩ², since k is N/m = kg/s². So yes, both terms under the square root have units of (kg/s²)^2, so the units are consistent. Good.\n\nSo, moving on. So k - mΩ² is -100 kg/s², and γΩ is 120 kg/s²? Wait, no:\n\nWait, γ is 4 Ns/m, which is 4 kg/s (as above). Ω is 30 s⁻¹. Therefore, γΩ is 4 kg/s * 30 s⁻¹ = 120 kg/s². Yes, so that term is 120 kg/s². Therefore, the denominator is sqrt[(-100)^2 + (120)^2] kg/s².\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(-100)^2 = 10,000\n\n(120)^2 = 14,400\n\nSum is 10,000 + 14,400 = 24,400\n\nSo sqrt(24,400). Let me compute that. sqrt(24,400). Well sqrt(24,400) = sqrt(244 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(244). Let me compute sqrt(244). 15² is 225, 16² is 256, so sqrt(244) ≈ 15.62... Let me check 15.6² = 243.36, which is very close to 244. So sqrt(244) ≈ 15.62. Therefore sqrt(24,400) ≈ 15.62 * 10 ≈ 156.2 kg/s². Let me check with exact numbers:\n\nBut maybe exact value is better. Let me see:\n\nBut 24,400 is 244 * 100. 244 factors into 4 * 61, so sqrt(244) = 2*sqrt(61). Therefore sqrt(24,400) = 2*sqrt(61)*10 = 20*sqrt(61). Let me check sqrt(61) ≈ 7.81, so 20*7.81 ≈ 156.2. So yes, approximately 156.2 kg/s².\n\nTherefore, B = F₀ / [sqrt(...)] = 2 N / (156.2 kg/s²). Let me compute that. First, note that N is kg·m/s². Therefore, B has units of [kg·m/s²] / [kg/s²] = m. Which is correct, since B is an amplitude in meters.\n\nSo B ≈ 2 / 156.2 ≈ 0.0128 m. Let me compute that more accurately. Let me do exact fractions first.\n\nBut maybe I should carry out exact calculations. Let me redo the denominator:\n\n(k - mΩ²) = 80 - 0.2*(30)^2 = 80 - 0.2*900 = 80 - 180 = -100.\n\nγΩ = 4 * 30 = 120.\n\nTherefore, denominator is sqrt( (-100)^2 + (120)^2 ) = sqrt(10000 + 14400) = sqrt(24400). Let me compute sqrt(24400). Let me note that 156^2 = 24336, as 150²=22500, 155²=24025, 156²=24025 + 2*155 +1 = 24025 + 310 +1 = 24336. Then 156.2² = ?\n\nLet me compute 156.2²:\n\nFirst, 156² = 24336.\n\nThen, (156 + 0.2)^2 = 156² + 2*156*0.2 + 0.2² = 24336 + 62.4 + 0.04 = 24398.44. Which is still less than 24400. The difference is 24400 - 24398.44 = 1.56. So sqrt(24400) ≈ 156.2 + 1.56/(2*156.2) ≈ 156.2 + 1.56/312.4 ≈ 156.2 + 0.005 ≈ 156.205. So approximately 156.205. Therefore, sqrt(24400) ≈ 156.205. Therefore, B ≈ 2 / 156.205 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 2 / 156.205. Let me approximate 1/156.205 ≈ 0.0064 (since 1/160 ≈ 0.00625). Let me compute 1/156.2 ≈ 0.006402. Let me check 156.2 * 0.0064 = 156.2 * 6.4 * 10⁻³. Let me compute 156.2 * 6.4:\n\nFirst, 150*6.4=960, 6.2*6.4=39.68, so total is 960 + 39.68 = 999.68. Therefore, 156.2 * 6.4 * 10⁻³ ≈ 999.68 * 10⁻³ ≈ 0.99968. Which is very close to 1. Therefore, 1/156.2 ≈ 6.4 * 10⁻³. Therefore, 2 / 156.2 ≈ 2 * 6.4 * 10⁻³ = 0.0128 m. So approximately 0.0128 meters, which is 1.28 centimeters. Let me note that.\n\nBut let me check with calculator-like precision. Let me do 2 divided by 156.205. Let me write 156.205 × 0.0128 = ?\n\nWell, 156.205 × 0.01 = 1.56205\n\n156.205 × 0.0028 = ?\n\nFirst, 156.205 × 0.002 = 0.31241\n\n156.205 × 0.0008 = 0.124964\n\nAdding those gives 0.31241 + 0.124964 ≈ 0.437374\n\nTherefore, total is 1.56205 + 0.437374 ≈ 1.999424 ≈ 2. So indeed, 156.205 × 0.0128 ≈ 2. Therefore, B ≈ 0.0128 m. So that's 1.28 cm. So B ≈ 0.0128 m.\n\nBut let me check if I can write it as exact fraction. Since sqrt(24400) is sqrt(100*244) = 10*sqrt(244). And 244 is 4*61, so sqrt(244) = 2*sqrt(61). Therefore sqrt(24400) = 10*2*sqrt(61) = 20*sqrt(61). Therefore, B = 2 / (20*sqrt(61)) = 1/(10*sqrt(61)) ≈ 1/(10*7.81) ≈ 1/78.1 ≈ 0.0128 m. So exact expression is 1/(10√61) m. But maybe rationalizing the denominator? Not sure if needed. The question probably expects a decimal value. Let me compute 1/(10*7.81) ≈ 0.0128 m. So approximately 0.0128 m. Let me check with calculator numbers. Let me compute sqrt(61) ≈ 7.8102. Therefore 10*sqrt(61) ≈ 78.102. Therefore 1 / 78.102 ≈ 0.0128 m. So that's correct. So B ≈ 0.0128 m. Let me note that.\n\nNow, moving on to the phase angle φ. φ = arctan[γΩ / (k - mΩ²)].\n\nWe already calculated γΩ = 120, and (k - mΩ²) = -100. Therefore, φ = arctan(120 / (-100)) = arctan(-1.2). But arctangent of -1.2. However, since the denominator (k - mΩ²) is negative, and the numerator γΩ is positive, this means that the phase angle is in which quadrant?\n\nThe formula φ = arctan[γΩ / (k - mΩ²)]. The tangent is negative here. Since γΩ is positive (120) and (k - mΩ²) is negative (-100), the ratio is negative. Therefore, arctangent is negative. However, the phase angle φ is the phase lag of the displacement relative to the driving force. In driven oscillators, the phase angle φ typically ranges between 0 and π (or 0 and 180 degrees). Wait, let me recall.\n\nIn general, for a driven oscillator, when the driving frequency is below the natural frequency, the displacement is in phase with the driver (φ near 0), and when above, it's π out of phase (φ near π). But with damping, the phase angle goes from 0 to π as Ω increases through the resonance.\n\nBut in our case, since we have a negative denominator and positive numerator, the arctangent would give us a value in the second quadrant? Wait, arctangent takes into account the signs of numerator and denominator? Wait, no. The standard arctangent function (without considering quadrants) only gives values between -π/2 and π/2. So if we just compute arctan(-1.2), it would give us a value in the fourth quadrant. However, the actual phase angle should be in the second quadrant because the numerator (γΩ) is positive and denominator (k - mΩ²) is negative. Therefore, we need to add π to the result to get it into the correct quadrant.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. The phase angle φ is given by:\n\nφ = arctan[γΩ / (k - mΩ²)]\n\nBut when (k - mΩ²) is negative and γΩ is positive, the ratio is negative, so arctan gives us a negative angle, but the actual phase angle should be π + arctan(...). Wait, no. Let me think. Let me consider the complex representation. The denominator in the complex plane is (k - mΩ²) + i γΩ. Wait, no. The amplitude formula comes from the magnitude of the complex denominator, and the phase comes from the argument. Let me think again.\n\nIn the steady-state solution, the displacement can be written as x = B cos(Ωt - φ). The equation can be represented in complex form as:\n\nm(-Ω²)X + iγΩ X + kX = F₀ / (-iΩ)\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall the complex representation. Let me consider the complex amplitude X such that x = Re[X e^{iΩt}]. Then the equation becomes:\n\n(-mΩ² + iγΩ + k) X = F₀ / (iΩ)\n\nWait, no. Let me do it properly. The differential equation is:\n\nm d²x/dt² + γ dx/dt + kx = F₀ cos(Ωt)\n\nAssume x = Re[X e^{iΩt}], then substituting:\n\nm (-Ω² X e^{iΩt}) + γ (iΩ X e^{iΩt}) + k X e^{iΩt} = F₀ e^{iΩt}\n\nDividing both sides by e^{iΩt}:\n\n(-mΩ² + i γ Ω + k) X = F₀\n\nTherefore, X = F₀ / [k - mΩ² + i γ Ω]\n\nTherefore, the complex amplitude X is F₀ divided by [k - mΩ² + i γ Ω]. Therefore, the magnitude |X| is B, and the phase angle φ is the argument of X, which is -arg(denominator), because X = F₀ / denominator. Wait, since X = F₀ / (denominator), then the phase of X is - the phase of the denominator. Let me check:\n\nIf X = A / (C + iD), then the phase of X is - arctan(D/C) if C > 0, or - arctan(D/C) + π if C < 0. Therefore, in our case, the denominator is (k - mΩ²) + i γ Ω = (-100) + i (120). Therefore, the phase of the denominator is arctan(120 / (-100)) + π, since the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive. Therefore, the phase of the denominator is π - arctan(120 / 100) = π - arctan(1.2). Therefore, the phase of X is - [π - arctan(1.2)] = arctan(1.2) - π. However, since φ is the phase lag of x relative to the driving force, which is defined as x = B cos(Ωt - φ). In terms of complex numbers, X = B e^{iφ}, because x = Re[X e^{iΩt}] = Re[B e^{iφ} e^{iΩt}] = B Re[e^{i(Ωt + φ)}] = B cos(Ωt + φ). Wait, but the question says x = B cos(Ωt - φ). Therefore, comparing, we have Ωt - φ = Ωt + φ', so φ' = -φ. Therefore, depending on the convention. Let me check again.\n\nIf X is the complex amplitude such that x = Re[X e^{iΩt}], and X has magnitude B and phase φ, then:\n\nX = B e^{iφ}\n\nTherefore, x = Re[B e^{iφ} e^{iΩt}] = B Re[e^{i(Ωt + φ)}] = B cos(Ωt + φ). But the problem states that the steady-state motion is x = B cos(Ωt - φ). Therefore, comparing Ωt - φ with Ωt + φ, we have -φ = φ => φ = -φ', so φ' = -φ. Therefore, the phase angle φ in the problem is equal to - the phase of X. Therefore, since the phase of X is arctan(1.2) - π, then φ = - [arctan(1.2) - π] = π - arctan(1.2).\n\nAlternatively, since tan(φ) = [γΩ]/[mΩ² - k], but with signs? Wait, let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula φ = arctan[γΩ / (k - mΩ²)]. But since k - mΩ² is negative and γΩ is positive, then φ = arctan(negative number). But arctangent gives us an angle in the fourth quadrant, but the actual angle is in the second quadrant. Therefore, we need to add π to the arctangent result. Therefore:\n\nφ = arctan(γΩ / (k - mΩ²)) + π ?\n\nWait, let me take an example. Suppose we have a complex number with real part negative and imaginary part positive, which is in the second quadrant. Its argument is π - arctan(|imaginary| / |real|). Therefore, in our case, the denominator is complex number with real part -100 and imaginary part +120, so its argument is π - arctan(120 / 100) = π - arctan(1.2). Therefore, since X = F₀ / denominator, the phase of X is - (π - arctan(1.2)) = arctan(1.2) - π. However, since in the problem statement, the phase is defined such that x = B cos(Ωt - φ), which corresponds to X having phase φ (as above), so φ = arctan(1.2) - π. But arctan(1.2) - π is a negative angle. Alternatively, adding 2π to get it into a positive range. But usually, phase angles are given between 0 and π for driven oscillators.\n\nAlternatively, since tan(φ) = [γΩ]/[mΩ² - k]. Wait, if we rearrange:\n\ntan(φ) = [γΩ]/[k - mΩ²] ?\n\nWait, earlier we had φ = arctan[γΩ / (k - mΩ²)], but with consideration of the correct quadrant. Let me check another resource or derivation.\n\nIn standard driven oscillator theory, the phase angle φ is given by:\n\ntan φ = [γ Ω] / [k - m Ω²]\n\nBut depending on the convention of how φ is defined. If φ is the phase of the displacement relative to the driving force, then when the displacement lags the driver, φ is positive. Let me recall that when the driving frequency is above resonance, the displacement lags by more than π/2, approaching π.\n\nIn our case, since the denominator k - mΩ² is negative, that suggests that Ω is greater than the natural frequency ω₀ = sqrt(k/m). Let me compute ω₀:\n\nω₀ = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(80 / 0.2) = sqrt(400) = 20 rad/s. The driving frequency is Ω = 30 rad/s, which is higher than ω₀, so we are in the regime where the displacement lags the driver by more than π/2. Therefore, φ should be between π/2 and π. \n\nGiven that tan φ = [γ Ω]/[k - m Ω²] = 120 / (-100) = -1.2. However, since φ is between π/2 and π, tan φ is negative, which matches. But arctangent of -1.2 would give us an angle in the fourth quadrant, but we need the angle in the second quadrant. Therefore, φ = π + arctan(-1.2) = π - arctan(1.2). Because arctan(-1.2) = - arctan(1.2). Therefore, φ = π - arctan(1.2). \n\nLet me compute arctan(1.2). Let me recall that arctan(1) = π/4 ≈ 0.785 rad, arctan(√3) ≈ 1.047 rad (which is π/3). 1.2 is between 1 and √3 ≈ 1.732. Let me compute arctan(1.2) approximately. \n\nUsing a calculator (pretending I have one here). Let me recall that tan(50 degrees) ≈ 1.191, tan(51 degrees) ≈ 1.234. Therefore, arctan(1.2) is approximately 50.2 degrees? Let me check:\n\nLet me convert to radians. 50 degrees is approx 0.8727 rad, 51 degrees is approx 0.8901 rad. Let me compute tan(0.877 rad):\n\nLet me take x = 0.877 rad. Let me compute tan(x). Since tan(50 degrees) ≈ 1.191, which is at 0.8727 rad. Let me compute tan(0.877):\n\nUsing Taylor series might be complicated. Alternatively, let me take linear approximation between 50 degrees and 51 degrees.\n\nAt 50 degrees (approx 0.8727 rad): tan ≈ 1.191\n\nAt 51 degrees (approx 0.8901 rad): tan ≈ 1.234\n\nWe want tan(x) = 1.2. The difference between 1.2 and 1.191 is 0.009. The total difference between 1.234 and 1.191 is 0.043 over 1 degree (0.01745 rad). So fraction is 0.009 / 0.043 ≈ 0.209. Therefore, approximate angle is 50 degrees + 0.209 * 1 degree ≈ 50.209 degrees ≈ 50.2 degrees. Therefore, arctan(1.2) ≈ 50.2 degrees. Converting to radians: 50.2 degrees * π / 180 ≈ 0.876 rad.\n\nAlternatively, let me use calculator-like values. But since I don't have a calculator here, let me just note that arctan(1.2) ≈ 0.876 rad. Therefore, φ = π - 0.876 ≈ 3.1416 - 0.876 ≈ 2.2656 rad. Converting that to degrees: 2.2656 rad * (180/π) ≈ 129.8 degrees. Which is between 90 and 180 degrees, as expected.\n\nTherefore, φ ≈ 2.2656 rad. Let me check with more precise calculation. Alternatively, if I can remember that tan(π/2 - φ') = cot φ', but maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since tan(φ) = -1.2, but φ is in the second quadrant. Therefore, φ = π - arctan(1.2). Therefore, if I can compute arctan(1.2) more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for arctangent. Let me use the Taylor series expansion around π/4? Not sure. Alternatively, use the identity:\n\narctan(a) + arctan(1/a) = π/2 for a > 0. Therefore, arctan(1.2) + arctan(1/1.2) = π/2. Therefore, arctan(5/6) ≈ π/2 - arctan(1.2). But not sure if helpful here. Alternatively, use iterative method.\n\nAlternatively, accept the approximate value of 0.876 rad for arctan(1.2). Therefore, φ ≈ π - 0.876 ≈ 2.265 rad. Let me check with decimal degrees. If 50.2 degrees is approx 0.876 rad, then π - 0.876 ≈ 2.265 rad ≈ 129.8 degrees. Let me check with another approach. If Ω is 30 rad/s, ω₀ is 20 rad/s, damping ratio ζ?\n\nWait, maybe compute the damping ratio? Not sure. The damping ratio ζ is γ/(2√(mk)). Let me compute that:\n\nγ = 4 Ns/m, m = 0.2 kg, k = 80 N/m. So √(mk) = √(0.2 * 80) = √(16) = 4. Therefore ζ = 4 / (2*4) = 0.5. So critically damped? No, ζ = 0.5 is underdamped. Okay, but not sure if helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for phase angle:\n\nφ = arctan[γΩ / (k - mΩ²)] but adjusted for the correct quadrant. Since we have already reasoned that φ is π - arctan(1.2), let me just compute that value numerically.\n\nAlternatively, use a calculator (pretend). Let me note that 1.2 is 6/5. So arctan(6/5). If I remember that tan(50°) ≈ 1.191, tan(50.2°) ≈ 1.2. Let me check tan(50.2°):\n\nUsing a calculator (pretend), tan(50.2°):\n\nFirst, 50° is 1.191, tan(50.2°) ≈ tan(50° + 0.2°). The derivative of tan(x) is sec²x. At x = 50°, which is approx 0.8727 rad, tan(x) ≈ 1.191, sec²x = 1 + tan²x ≈ 1 + 1.418 ≈ 2.418. Therefore, the change in tan(x) for a small change Δx is approximately sec²x * Δx. Therefore, Δx = 0.2° = 0.2 * π/180 ≈ 0.00349 rad. Therefore, Δ(tan(x)) ≈ 2.418 * 0.00349 ≈ 0.00845. Therefore, tan(50.2°) ≈ 1.191 + 0.00845 ≈ 1.199. But we need tan(x) = 1.2. Therefore, need a little more. Let me do another iteration. Let me assume that tan(50.3°). Let me compute Δx = 0.3° = 0.00523 rad. Then Δ(tan(x)) ≈ 2.418 * 0.00523 ≈ 0.0126. Therefore tan(50.3°) ≈ 1.191 + 0.0126 ≈ 1.2036. Which is slightly above 1.2. Therefore, arctan(1.2) is between 50.2° and 50.3°, closer to 50.25°. Let me do linear approximation. At 50.2°, tan ≈ 1.199, need 1.2 - 1.199 = 0.001. The difference between 50.2° and 50.3° gives an increase of 0.0126 - 0.00845 = 0.00415 in tan(x) over 0.1°. To get 0.001, fraction is 0.001 / 0.00415 ≈ 0.24. Therefore, approx 50.2° + 0.24 * 0.1° ≈ 50.224°, so approx 50.22°. Therefore, arctan(1.2) ≈ 50.22°, which is approx 50.2°, as before. Converting to radians: 50.2° * π/180 ≈ 0.876 rad. Therefore, φ ≈ π - 0.876 ≈ 2.265 rad. \n\nTo convert 2.265 rad to degrees: 2.265 * (180/π) ≈ 2.265 * 57.2958 ≈ 129.8 degrees. Which is approximately 130 degrees. Therefore, φ ≈ 2.265 rad or 129.8 degrees.\n\nBut the question asks for the phase angle φ. Depending on what form is required, maybe in radians or degrees? The problem doesn't specify, but since Ω is given in rad/s, probably expects radians. However, let me check if there's a more precise way to write φ. Alternatively, we can write it as π - arctan(6/5) or something like that, but likely needs a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, using exact expressions. Since tan(φ) = -1.2 = -6/5, but φ is in the second quadrant. Therefore, φ = π - arctan(6/5). But unless they want an exact expression, which is unlikely, we need to compute the numerical value.\n\nTherefore, φ ≈ 2.265 rad. Let me check with more accurate calculation. Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me use the fact that tan(φ) = -1.2, and φ is in second quadrant. Let me use iterative method.\n\nLet me start with φ = 2.265 rad. Let me compute tan(2.265). First, 2.265 rad is approx 129.8 degrees. Let me compute tan(2.265). Since tan(π - x) = -tan(x). Therefore tan(φ) = tan(π - arctan(1.2)) = -tan(arctan(1.2)) = -1.2, which matches. Therefore, φ is indeed π - arctan(1.2) ≈ 2.265 rad. Therefore, we can take φ ≈ 2.265 rad.\n\nAlternatively, compute it more accurately. Let me use a better approximation for arctan(1.2). Let me use the Newton-Raphson method. Let me define f(x) = tan(x) - 1.2, find root between π/2 and π/2? No, we know that arctan(1.2) is between π/4 and π/3. Wait, no, we are looking for arctan(1.2) in the first quadrant. Let me set x₀ = 0.9 rad (approx 51.6 degrees). tan(0.9) ≈ tan(51.6°). Let me compute tan(0.9 rad). 0.9 rad ≈ 51.6 degrees. Let me compute tan(0.9):\n\nUsing Taylor series around π/4 (0.785 rad), but maybe better to use calculator-like values. Alternatively, use the identity tan(a + b). Alternatively, use known that tan(0.785) = 1, tan(1.0) ≈ 1.5574, tan(0.9) can be estimated. Let me use linear approximation between 0.8 rad and 1.0 rad.\n\nAt 0.8 rad: tan(0.8) ≈ 1.0998\n\nAt 0.9 rad: ?\n\nAt 1.0 rad: tan(1.0) ≈ 1.5574\n\nAssume linearity between 0.8 and 1.0 rad. The difference in tan is 1.5574 - 1.0998 ≈ 0.4576 over 0.2 rad. We want tan(x) = 1.2. At x = 0.8 rad, tan(x)=1.0998. Need 1.2 - 1.0998 = 0.1002. Fraction is 0.1002 / 0.4576 ≈ 0.2188. Therefore, approximate x ≈ 0.8 + 0.2188*0.2 ≈ 0.8 + 0.0438 ≈ 0.8438 rad. Let me check tan(0.8438 rad). Let me use calculator-like estimation. Alternatively, use better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, use Newton-Raphson. Let me take x₀ = 0.86 rad. Let me compute tan(0.86):\n\nUsing calculator (pretend), tan(0.86) ≈ tan(49.3 degrees) ≈ 1.15. Let me suppose tan(0.86) ≈ 1.15. We need tan(x) = 1.2. Let me take x₀ = 0.87 rad. Let me estimate tan(0.87). Let me use derivative. At x = 0.87 rad, tan(x) ≈ ?\n\nIf I take x = 0.86 rad, tan(x) ≈ 1.15 (assumed). The derivative of tan(x) is sec²x = 1 + tan²x. At tan(x) = 1.15, sec²x ≈ 1 + 1.3225 = 2.3225. Therefore, tan(x + Δx) ≈ tan(x) + sec²x * Δx. We need tan(x + Δx) = 1.2. So 1.15 + 2.3225 * Δx = 1.2 => Δx ≈ (0.05)/2.3225 ≈ 0.0215 rad. Therefore, x ≈ 0.86 + 0.0215 ≈ 0.8815 rad. Let me check tan(0.8815 rad). Again, using derivative at x = 0.8815 rad. Suppose tan(x) ≈ 1.2. Let me assume that after this iteration, we get closer. Therefore, arctan(1.2) ≈ 0.876 rad, as previously estimated. Therefore, φ ≈ π - 0.876 ≈ 2.265 rad. Therefore, φ ≈ 2.265 rad. \n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nAmplitude B ≈ 0.0128 m, which is 1.28 cm.\n\nPhase angle φ ≈ 2.265 radians.\n\nBut let me check if these numbers make sense. Given that the driving frequency is much higher than the natural frequency (30 vs 20 rad/s), the amplitude should be relatively small because the system can't follow the rapid oscillations, which matches our B ≈ 0.0128 m. The phase angle being around 130 degrees (≈ 2.265 rad) means that the displacement lags the driving force by about 130 degrees, which is more than π/2, as expected when Ω > ω₀.\n\nTherefore, these results seem reasonable.\n\nBut let me check my calculation for B again. Given that:\n\nB = F₀ / sqrt[(k - mΩ²)^2 + (γΩ)^2] = 2 / sqrt[(-100)^2 + (120)^2] = 2 / sqrt(10000 + 14400) = 2 / sqrt(24400) ≈ 2 / 156.2 ≈ 0.0128 m. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute sqrt(24400):\n\nAs mentioned earlier, sqrt(24400) = sqrt(244 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(244). sqrt(244) is approx 15.62, so 10 * 15.62 = 156.2. Therefore, 2 / 156.2 ≈ 0.0128. Correct.\n\nTherefore, B ≈ 0.0128 m. If I want more decimal places, let me compute 2 / 156.205 ≈ 0.0128 m. Let me compute 2 ÷ 156.205:\n\nLet me do this division more accurately. Let me write it as 2 / 156.205 ≈ ?\n\nLet me note that 1 / 156.205 ≈ 0.006401 (as before). Therefore, 2 * 0.006401 ≈ 0.012802 m. So approximately 0.0128 m. To three decimal places, it's approximately 0.0128 m. Depending on what precision is required. Let me check with exact fraction:\n\nB = 2 / (20√61) = 1 / (10√61). Let me rationalize:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √61:\n\nB = √61 / (10 * 61) = √61 / 610 ≈ 7.81 / 610 ≈ 0.0128 m. Same result.\n\nTherefore, B ≈ 0.0128 m. If I want more precise value, let me use √61 ≈ 7.81024967591. Therefore, B ≈ 7.81024967591 / 610 ≈ 0.0128037 m. So approximately 0.0128 m. So 0.0128 meters is 1.28 centimeters. \n\nFor φ, if we want more precise value, let me use a better approximation for arctan(1.2). Let me use a calculator value (pretend I have one here). Let me recall that tan(50°12') ≈ tan(50.2°) ≈ 1.2. Let me check with a calculator (pretend):\n\nIf I look up arctan(1.2), it is approximately 0.87605855 radians. Therefore, φ = π - 0.87605855 ≈ 3.14159265 - 0.87605855 ≈ 2.2655341 radians. Therefore, φ ≈ 2.2655 rad. To three decimal places, 2.266 rad. \n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nAmplitude B ≈ 0.0128 m\n\nPhase angle φ ≈ 2.266 rad\n\nBut let me check if there is a calculation mistake. Let me recompute φ:\n\nGiven tan(φ) = γΩ / (k - mΩ²) = 120 / (-100) = -1.2. Since the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive, the phase angle is π - arctan(1.2) ≈ π - 0.876 ≈ 2.265 rad. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using complex numbers, the phase angle can be calculated as:\n\nφ = arctan2(γΩ, k - mΩ²). The arctan2 function takes into account the signs of both arguments. In this case, arctan2(120, -100) which is in the second quadrant. The value is π - arctan(120/100) = π - arctan(1.2). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the results are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nB ≈ 0.0128 m\n\nφ ≈ 2.266 rad\n\nBut let me check if the question expects exact fractions or decimals. Given that all the input values are decimal numbers, likely expects decimal answers. However, let me see if I can write more precise decimals.\n\nFor B:\n\nB = 2 / sqrt(24400) = 2 / (sqrt(244)*10) ≈ 2 / (15.6205*10) ≈ 2 / 156.205 ≈ 0.0128 m. Let me compute 2 divided by 156.205:\n\nLet me do 156.205 × 0.0128 = 2.0 (as checked before). Therefore, B is exactly 0.0128 m? No, because 156.205 × 0.0128 ≈ 2.0, but due to rounding, the exact value is approximately 0.0128037 m. So if I want three significant figures, since F₀ is given as 2 N (one significant figure? Wait, no, 2 N is one significant figure? Wait, the given values are:\n\nm = 0.2 kg (one decimal place, possibly two significant figures if the zero is not significant? Wait, 0.2 kg is one significant figure. However, in many cases, trailing zeros after decimal are significant. Wait, 0.2 kg has one significant figure. Similarly, k=80 N/m could be one or two significant figures. Hmm. But in most textbook problems, unless specified, we assume that the given numbers are exact. For example, m=0.2 kg might be an exact value. However, since the problem is theoretical, and all the given numbers are likely exact, so we can compute B and φ to sufficient decimal places.\n\nBut since the problem says \"Find the amplitude B and phase angle φ\", without specifying, probably expects exact expressions or decimal values. Given that in the calculation we have exact fractions, but they result in irrational numbers. Therefore, decimal values are expected. \n\nGiven that, for B, let me compute it more accurately. Let me take sqrt(24400):\n\nAs above, sqrt(24400) = 156.204993518... Therefore, B = 2 / 156.204993518 ≈ 0.0128037... So approximately 0.0128 m. If we want three significant figures, since F₀ is 2 N (one significant figure?), but maybe in the problem all values are given with two decimal places or something. Wait:\n\nOriginal values:\n\nm = 0.2 kg (one decimal place)\n\nk = 80 N/m (no decimal places)\n\nγ = 4 Ns/m (no decimal places)\n\nF₀ = 2 N (no decimal places)\n\nΩ = 30 s⁻¹ (no decimal places)\n\nTherefore, all given quantities have one or two significant figures. For example, m=0.2 kg is one significant figure, k=80 could be one or two, depending on if the trailing zero is significant. If written as 80. N/m, it would be two, but as 80 N/m, it's ambiguous. Similarly for others. However, in most textbook problems, such numbers are considered as exact. For example, m=0.2 kg is exact, so we can compute B and φ to full precision.\n\nTherefore, I can present B ≈ 0.0128 m and φ ≈ 2.27 rad (rounded to three decimal places or three significant figures). Let me check:\n\nB ≈ 0.0128 m is 0.0128 m. If we want three significant figures, since 0.0128 has three significant figures (the leading zeros don't count). Yes, 1, 2, 8 are significant. So 0.0128 m is three significant figures. Similarly, φ ≈ 2.266 rad is approximately 2.27 rad when rounded to three significant figures. Wait, 2.266 rad is approximately 2.27 rad (three significant figures). However, if we want more precise, since the exact value is approximately 2.2655 rad, which is ≈ 2.266 rad. Depending on what is expected.\n\nAlternatively, present both values with three decimal places. Let me check:\n\nFor B, 0.0128 m is 0.0128 m. If we write three decimal places, it would be 0.013 m? Wait, no. 0.0128 is 0.0128, so three decimal places is 0.013 m? Wait, no. Three decimal places would be 0.0128 is 0.0128, so three decimal places is 0.013? Wait, no, decimal places are positions after the decimal. So 0.0128 is 0.0128, which is four decimal places. To three decimal places, it's 0.013 (since the fourth decimal is 8, which rounds up). But if the value is approximately 0.0128037 m, then to three decimal places is 0.013 m. However, if we keep more decimals, it's 0.0128 m. Depending on the required precision.\n\nBut given that the problem gives F₀ as 2 N, which is one significant figure, but others have more, it's a bit ambiguous. However, since in physics problems like this, usually you carry out the calculation with the given numbers as exact and present the answers to a reasonable number of decimal places. Given that, I think it's safe to present B as approximately 0.0128 m and φ as approximately 2.27 rad. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with exact computation using more precise numbers.\n\nFor B:\n\nLet me compute sqrt(24400) precisely. Let me note that 156.2049935^2 = ?\n\nWell, 156.2049935^2 ≈ (156.2)^2 + ... Well, we know that 156.2^2 = 24398.44, as before. The exact value of sqrt(24400) is sqrt(244 * 100) = 10*sqrt(244). Let me compute sqrt(244) with more precision.\n\nWe know that 15.6^2 = 243.36, as before. 15.62^2 = ?\n\n15.62^2 = (15.6 + 0.02)^2 = 15.6² + 2*15.6*0.02 + 0.02² = 243.36 + 0.624 + 0.0004 = 243.9844\n\nCompare to 244. The difference is 244 - 243.9844 = 0.0156. Therefore, let me do a linear approximation. Let x = 15.62 + Δx, such that x² = 244. \n\n(15.62 + Δx)^2 ≈ 243.9844 + 2*15.62*Δx = 244.\n\nTherefore, 2*15.62*Δx ≈ 0.0156 => Δx ≈ 0.0156 / 31.24 ≈ 0.000499. Therefore, sqrt(244) ≈ 15.62 + 0.0005 ≈ 15.6205. Therefore, sqrt(244) ≈ 15.6205. Therefore, sqrt(24400) = 10*sqrt(244) ≈ 156.205. Therefore, B = 2 / 156.205 ≈ 0.0128037 m. So approximately 0.01280 m. Rounded to five decimal places, 0.01280 m. Therefore, to three decimal places, 0.013 m. However, if the question expects more decimals, maybe present as 0.0128 m.\n\nFor φ, with sqrt(244) ≈ 15.6205, and arctan(1.2) ≈ 0.876058 rad, then φ ≈ π - 0.876058 ≈ 3.14159265 - 0.876058 ≈ 2.265534 rad. Rounded to five decimal places, 2.26553 rad. Therefore, to three decimal places, 2.266 rad. \n\nTherefore, depending on what is expected, but since in most cases three decimal places or three significant figures are acceptable. Given that, I can write:\n\nB ≈ 0.0128 m (which is three significant figures)\n\nφ ≈ 2.27 rad (three significant figures)\n\nAlternatively, if more precision is needed, write more decimals. However, given the problem's data, three significant figures seem appropriate.\n\nBut let me check the significant figures again. For example, m is 0.2 kg (one significant figure?), but others are two? It's ambiguous. However, if we consider that in technical problems, unless stated otherwise, the numbers are assumed to be precise, and you can give as many decimal places as the calculation allows. Therefore, I can present the answers as:\n\nAmplitude B = 0.0128 m\n\nPhase angle φ = 2.27 rad\n\nAlternatively, check if there's a calculation mistake. Let me recompute φ with more precise arctan(1.2):\n\nUsing an approximate value from online (pretend I look it up), arctan(1.2) is approximately 0.876058 radians. Therefore, φ = π - 0.876058 ≈ 3.14159265 - 0.876058 ≈ 2.265534 radians, which is approximately 2.2655 rad. Rounded to three decimal places, 2.266 rad. Rounded to three significant figures, 2.27 rad (since 2.2655 is approximately 2.27 when rounded to three significant figures). Yes, because the third significant figure is 6, and the next digit is 5, so we round up. So 2.2655 ≈ 2.27 when rounded to three significant figures.\n\nSimilarly, B = 0.0128037 m. Rounded to three significant figures is 0.0128 m (since the first non-zero digit is the first significant figure). Yes, 0.0128 has three significant figures: 1, 2, 8.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nB = 0.0128 m\n\nφ = 2.27 rad\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects more precise answers, maybe four decimal places, but without specific instructions, three significant figures is safe.\n\nAlternatively, present both exact expressions and decimal approximations. But the question says \"Find the amplitude B and phase angle φ\", so decimal numbers are expected.\n\nTherefore, my final answers are:\n\nAmplitude B ≈ 0.0128 m\n\nPhase angle φ ≈ 2.27 rad\n\nBut let me check once more for calculation errors. Let me verify B:\n\nGiven m=0.2, k=80, γ=4, F₀=2, Ω=30.\n\nCompute k - mΩ²: 80 - 0.2*(900) = 80 - 180 = -100. Correct.\n\nγΩ = 4*30 = 120. Correct.\n\nDenominator sqrt( (-100)^2 + 120^2 ) = sqrt(10000 + 14400) = sqrt(24400) ≈ 156.205. Correct.\n\nB = 2 / 156.205 ≈ 0.0128 m. Correct.\n\nPhase angle: arctan(γΩ / (k - mΩ²)) = arctan(120 / -100) = arctan(-1.2). Since in second quadrant, φ = π - arctan(1.2) ≈ 2.265 rad ≈ 2.27 rad. Correct.\n\nTherefore, no errors detected.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe amplitude is $\\boxed{0.0128 \\, \\mathrm{m}}$ and the phase angle is $\\boxed{2.27 \\, \\mathrm{rad}}$.\n</think>"}
