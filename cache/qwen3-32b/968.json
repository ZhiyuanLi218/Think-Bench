Hmm, let me recall how cross products distribute over addition and scalar multiplication. I think cross product is bilinear, which means it's linear in each argument. So, I can expand this expression using distributive property. Let me write that out:\n\nFirst, expand the cross product:\n\n(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a\n\nSimplify the scalars:\n\n= 6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c) - (a × a)\n\nNow, I remember that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so a × a = 0. That simplifies the last term:\n\n= 6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c) - 0\n\nSo, now I need to compute these cross products: b × c, b × a, and a × c. Wait, some of these are given. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nGiven:\n\na × b = [6, -7, 3]\n\na × c = [4, 7, 2]\n\nb × c = [1, -7, 18]\n\nBut in my expression, I have b × a and a × c. Let me note that cross product is anti-commutative, meaning that b × a = - (a × b). So, I can substitute that in:\n\nSo, replacing b × a with - (a × b):\n\n= 6(b × c) + 2(-a × b) - 3(a × c)\n\nSo:\n\n= 6(b × c) - 2(a × b) - 3(a × c)\n\nNow, substituting the given vectors:\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\n6*(b × c) = 6*[1, -7, 18] = [6*1, 6*(-7), 6*18] = [6, -42, 108]\n\nThen, -2*(a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]\n\nThen, -3*(a × c) = -3*[4, 7, 2] = [-12, -21, -6]\n\nNow, add these three vectors together:\n\nFirst, add [6, -42, 108] + [-12, 14, -6]:\n\nLet me compute component-wise:\n\nx-component: 6 + (-12) = -6\n\ny-component: -42 + 14 = -28\n\nz-component: 108 + (-6) = 102\n\nSo that gives [-6, -28, 102]\n\nNow, add the third vector [-12, -21, -6] to this result:\n\nx-component: -6 + (-12) = -18\n\ny-component: -28 + (-21) = -49\n\nz-component: 102 + (-6) = 96\n\nTherefore, the final result is [-18, -49, 96]\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with 6*(b × c):\n\nOriginal b × c is [1, -7, 18], multiplied by 6:\n\n1*6=6, -7*6=-42, 18*6=108. Correct.\n\n-2*(a × b): a × b is [6, -7, 3], so -2*6=-12, -2*(-7)=14, -2*3=-6. Correct.\n\n-3*(a × c): a × c is [4,7,2], so -3*4=-12, -3*7=-21, -3*2=-6. Correct.\n\nAdding first two vectors:\n\nFirst vector [6, -42, 108] + second vector [-12, 14, -6]:\n\nx: 6 -12 = -6\n\ny: -42 +14 = -28\n\nz: 108 -6 = 102. Correct.\n\nThen adding third vector [-12, -21, -6]:\n\nx: -6 -12 = -18\n\ny: -28 -21 = -49\n\nz: 102 -6 = 96. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo the final answer is [-18, -49, 96]. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can verify using another approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write equations for the vectors a, b, c? But since cross products are given, maybe that's more complicated. However, maybe there's a way to check if my answer is consistent with some properties?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if my result satisfies certain relations. For example, if I consider that (2b - a) × (3c + a) should be orthogonal to both (2b - a) and (3c + a). However, without knowing the actual vectors a, b, c, it's hard to check. Alternatively, maybe I can check if my computation steps are correct.\n\nWait, let me check again the expansion:\n\nOriginal expression: (2b - a) × (3c + a)\n\nExpanding cross product:\n\n= 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a\n\nYes, that's correct. Then scalars:\n\n= 6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c) - (a × a)\n\nYes, correct. Then since a × a = 0, so that term is gone. Then replacing b × a with -a × b:\n\n= 6(b × c) - 2(a × b) - 3(a × c). Correct.\n\nThen substituting given values:\n\nGiven a × b = [6, -7, 3], so -2*(a × b) is [-12, 14, -6]\n\nGiven a × c = [4,7,2], so -3*(a × c) is [-12, -21, -6]\n\nGiven b × c = [1, -7, 18], so 6*(b × c) is [6, -42, 108]\n\nAdding them up:\n\nFirst term [6, -42, 108]\n\nSecond term [-12, 14, -6]\n\nThird term [-12, -21, -6]\n\nAdding component-wise:\n\nx: 6 -12 -12 = 6 -24 = -18\n\ny: -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49\n\nz: 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96\n\nYes, same result. So seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the vector [-18, -49, 96]. Let me check if the problem requires any specific formatting. The problem says to put the answer in boxed notation, so probably as \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}} or something similar.\n\nBut let me check once more if there is any possible mistake in the sign during the expansion. Let me redo the expansion step-by-step.\n\nOriginal expression: (2b - a) × (3c + a)\n\nLet me denote u = 2b - a and v = 3c + a. Then u × v.\n\nAlternatively, cross product is bilinear, so:\n\n(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a\n\nWhich is 6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c) - (a × a). Yes, same as before.\n\nAnother thing to check: when I replaced b × a with -a × b. Since a × b = - b × a. Therefore, b × a = - a × b. So that substitution is correct. Therefore, -2(a × b) is correct.\n\nYes, so substituting the given vectors:\n\n6*(b × c) is 6*[1, -7, 18] = [6, -42, 108]\n\n-2*(a × b) is -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]\n\n-3*(a × c) is -3*[4, 7, 2] = [-12, -21, -6]\n\nAdding them up:\n\nFirst add [6, -42, 108] and [-12, 14, -6]:\n\nx: 6 -12 = -6\n\ny: -42 +14 = -28\n\nz: 108 -6 = 102\n\nThen add [-12, -21, -6]:\n\nx: -6 -12 = -18\n\ny: -28 -21 = -49\n\nz: 102 -6 = 96\n\nYes, same result. So unless there's some miscalculation here that I can't see, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another method. Suppose I assign variables to vectors a, b, c and try to solve for them? Although with cross products given, solving for the vectors might be complex, but let's see.\n\nLet me denote vectors:\n\nLet me assume that vectors a, b, c are in R^3. The cross products are given. However, cross products don't uniquely determine the vectors, but maybe we can find some relations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the given cross products to check if our answer is consistent with some properties?\n\nFor instance, the cross product we found is [-18, -49, 96]. Let me check if this vector is orthogonal to (2b - a) and (3c + a). But since we don't know a, b, c, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check if the cross product we found satisfies some relation with the given cross products?\n\nAlternatively, think about the scalar triple products? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the sign of one of the terms?\n\nWait, let me check the expansion once more. The cross product is anti-commutative, so a × b = - b × a. Therefore, b × a = - a × b. So in the expansion, we have 2*(b × a) which is 2*(-a × b) = -2*(a × b). So that term is correct. Then -3*(a × c). So all the coefficients are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the arithmetic?\n\nLet me recompute the addition:\n\nFirst term: [6, -42, 108]\n\nSecond term: [-12, 14, -6]\n\nThird term: [-12, -21, -6]\n\nAdding first and second term:\n\nx: 6 + (-12) = -6\n\ny: -42 + 14 = -28\n\nz: 108 + (-6) = 102\n\nThen adding third term:\n\nx: -6 + (-12) = -18\n\ny: -28 + (-21) = -49\n\nz: 102 + (-6) = 96\n\nYes, same result. So arithmetic checks out. Therefore, I think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with hypothetical vectors. Suppose I try to find possible vectors a, b, c that satisfy the given cross products, then compute (2b - a) × (3c + a) directly. Although this might be complicated, but let me try.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me suppose some vectors. Let me pick a coordinate system to simplify.\n\nLet me assume vector a is along x-axis, and vector b is in the xy-plane. But since cross products are given, perhaps this is too vague. Alternatively, maybe assign components.\n\nLet me denote vectors:\n\nLet me let a = [a1, a2, a3]\n\nb = [b1, b2, b3]\n\nc = [c1, c2, c3]\n\nGiven that a × b = [6, -7, 3]\n\nCompute a × b:\n\n|i   j   k |\n\n|a1 a2 a3|\n\n|b1 b2 b3|\n\n= i*(a2b3 - a3b2) - j*(a1b3 - a3b1) + k*(a1b2 - a2b1) = [a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1]\n\nWhich equals [6, -7, 3]\n\nSimilarly for a × c = [4, 7, 2], which would be:\n\n[a2c3 - a3c2, a3c1 - a1c3, a1c2 - a2c1] = [4, 7, 2]\n\nAnd b × c = [1, -7, 18], which is:\n\n[b2c3 - b3c2, b3c1 - b1c3, b1c2 - b2c1] = [1, -7, 18]\n\nSo we have a system of equations here. However, solving this system for a, b, c would require solving for 9 variables with 9 equations (each cross product gives 3 equations). However, this is quite involved, but maybe we can assign some variables to simplify.\n\nAlternatively, since we only need to compute (2b - a) × (3c + a), maybe we can express this cross product in terms of the given cross products without solving for a, b, c. Which is what I did earlier. But since I already did that and verified the arithmetic, perhaps this is redundant. However, if I can find a contradiction, that would help.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to assign some values. Let me assume some components for a, b, c. Let me suppose that a is along x-axis, so a = [a, 0, 0]. Then, since a × b = [6, -7, 3], let's compute that.\n\nIf a = [a, 0, 0], then a × b = [0* b3 - 0 * b2, 0 * b1 - a * b3, a * b2 - 0 * b1] = [0, -a b3, a b2] = [6, -7, 3]\n\nTherefore, equating components:\n\n0 = 6? No, that's impossible. Therefore, my assumption that a is along x-axis is invalid? Wait, no, because the first component of a × b is zero if a is along x-axis and b is arbitrary. But in our case, a × b is given as [6, -7, 3], whose first component is 6. Therefore, my assumption that a is along x-axis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume a different coordinate system. For example, suppose that a and b are in the x-y plane, so that their cross product is along z-axis? But in our case, a × b has components in x, y, z. Therefore, the vectors a and b cannot be confined to a plane. Therefore, perhaps this approach is too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assign specific values. Let me try to find vectors a, b, c such that the cross products are as given. Let me suppose that vector a is arbitrary, then express b and c in terms of a?\n\nBut this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, think of the cross products as linear equations. Let me denote the cross products:\n\nLet me write the cross product equations as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write equations from a × b = [6, -7, 3]\n\nSo:\n\na2b3 - a3b2 = 6   (1)\n\na3b1 - a1b3 = -7   (2)\n\na1b2 - a2b1 = 3    (3)\n\nSimilarly for a × c = [4, 7, 2]:\n\na2c3 - a3c2 = 4   (4)\n\na3c1 - a1c3 = 7    (5)\n\na1c2 - a2c1 = 2    (6)\n\nAnd for b × c = [1, -7, 18]:\n\nb2c3 - b3c2 = 1   (7)\n\nb3c1 - b1c3 = -7   (8)\n\nb1c2 - b2c1 = 18   (9)\n\nSo, we have 9 equations with 9 variables (a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3,c1,c2,c3). Solving this system would give us the vectors, and then we can compute (2b - a) × (3c + a). However, solving this system is going to be very tedious. But maybe we can find some relations or make intelligent guesses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assign some variables to zero? For example, suppose that a3 = 0. Let me see if that's possible. If a3 = 0, then equation (1): a2b3 = 6. Equation (2): a3b1 - a1b3 = -a1b3 = -7 => a1b3 = 7. Equation (3): a1b2 - a2b1 = 3.\n\nSo if I assume a3 = 0, then we can have equations. Let me proceed with that assumption. Let me set a3 = 0. Then:\n\nFrom equation (1): a2b3 = 6.\n\nFrom equation (2): -a1b3 = -7 => a1b3 = 7.\n\nFrom equation (3): a1b2 - a2b1 = 3.\n\nSo, from equations (1) and (2), we can express b3 = 6 / a2 and b3 = 7 / a1. Therefore:\n\n6 / a2 = 7 / a1 => 6a1 = 7a2 => a2 = (6/7)a1.\n\nLet me denote a1 = k, then a2 = (6/7)k, and a3 = 0. So vector a is [k, 6k/7, 0].\n\nThen, b3 = 7 / a1 = 7 / k.\n\nFrom equation (3): a1b2 - a2b1 = 3. Substituting a1 = k, a2 = 6k/7:\n\nk*b2 - (6k/7)*b1 = 3.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nk*b2 - (6k/7)*b1 = 3. Let me divide both sides by k (assuming k ≠ 0):\n\nb2 - (6/7)*b1 = 3/k.\n\nSo that's one equation relating b1 and b2.\n\nNow, let's move to equations from a × c = [4, 7, 2].\n\nGiven a × c = [a2c3 - a3c2, a3c1 - a1c3, a1c2 - a2c1] = [a2c3, -a1c3, a1c2 - a2c1] since a3 = 0.\n\nWhich is equal to [4, 7, 2]. Therefore:\n\na2c3 = 4   (4)\n\n-a1c3 = 7   (5)\n\na1c2 - a2c1 = 2   (6)\n\nFrom equation (5): -a1c3 = 7 => c3 = -7 / a1 = -7 / k.\n\nFrom equation (4): a2c3 = 4. Substitute a2 = 6k/7 and c3 = -7/k:\n\n(6k/7)*(-7/k) = 6k/7 * (-7)/k = -6 = 4? Wait, that gives -6 = 4? Which is impossible. Contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that a3 = 0 is invalid. Therefore, a3 cannot be zero. Therefore, this approach fails.\n\nHmm, so maybe a3 ≠ 0. Let me try another assumption. Maybe assume that a1 = 0? Let me try that.\n\nLet me assume a1 = 0. Then:\n\nFrom equation (2): a3b1 - a1b3 = a3b1 = -7.\n\nFrom equation (3): a1b2 - a2b1 = -a2b1 = 3 => a2b1 = -3.\n\nFrom equation (1): a2b3 - a3b2 = 6.\n\nSo, with a1 = 0, vector a is [0, a2, a3].\n\nFrom equation (2): a3b1 = -7.\n\nFrom equation (3): a2b1 = -3.\n\nTherefore, if we solve for b1 from equation (3): b1 = -3 / a2. Substitute into equation (2):\n\na3*(-3 / a2) = -7 => -3a3 / a2 = -7 => 3a3 / a2 = 7 => a3 = (7/3)a2.\n\nLet me denote a2 = m, then a3 = (7/3)m. Therefore, vector a is [0, m, 7m/3].\n\nNow, equation (1): a2b3 - a3b2 = m*b3 - (7m/3)*b2 = 6.\n\nLet me write this as m*b3 - (7m/3)*b2 = 6. Assuming m ≠ 0, divide both sides by m:\n\nb3 - (7/3)*b2 = 6/m.\n\nNow, moving on to equations from a × c = [4, 7, 2]. Given a = [0, m, 7m/3], then:\n\na × c = [a2c3 - a3c2, a3c1 - a1c3, a1c2 - a2c1] = [m*c3 - (7m/3)*c2, (7m/3)*c1 - 0*c3, 0*c2 - m*c1] = [m*c3 - (7m/3)c2, (7m/3)c1, -m c1] = [4, 7, 2].\n\nTherefore, equating components:\n\nFirst component: m*c3 - (7m/3)c2 = 4   (4)\n\nSecond component: (7m/3)c1 = 7   (5)\n\nThird component: -m c1 = 2   (6)\n\nFrom equation (6): -m c1 = 2 => c1 = -2/m.\n\nFrom equation (5): (7m/3)c1 = 7. Substitute c1:\n\n(7m/3)*(-2/m) = -14/3 = 7? But -14/3 is not equal to 7. Contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that a1 = 0 is invalid. Therefore, this approach also fails.\n\nHmm, maybe assuming components to be zero is not working. Maybe I need another approach. Alternatively, maybe assign numerical values. Let me suppose some value for m or k. Alternatively, maybe take a different route.\n\nAlternatively, since solving for a, b, c is too complex, maybe trust my initial calculation. Since the expansion seems correct, and arithmetic checks out, maybe my answer is correct. Given that, I think I can be confident that [-18, -49, 96] is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check with another expansion. Let me think. Let me try to compute (2b - a) × (3c + a) in another way.\n\nAlternatively, use the distributive property differently:\n\n(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a, same as before. So same result. Therefore, no problem here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute (2b) × (3c) + (2b) × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a, which is same as above. So no problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check if the answer is consistent with the given cross products. For example, if I take the cross product I found, [-18, -49, 96], and check if it satisfies some relation?\n\nAlternatively, take dot product with some vector? For example, since cross product is orthogonal to both factors, but again, without knowing the actual vectors, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the cross product we found as a linear combination of given cross products. Let me see:\n\nOur result is 6(b × c) - 2(a × b) - 3(a × c). So if I think of the given cross products as vectors, then our result is 6*[1, -7, 18] -2*[6, -7, 3] -3*[4,7,2]. Which is exactly what I computed. So unless there is a miscalculation here, which I checked, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute each component separately:\n\nLet me recompute each component:\n\nFirst component:\n\n6*(b × c)_x - 2*(a × b)_x - 3*(a × c)_x\n\n= 6*1 - 2*6 - 3*4 = 6 - 12 - 12 = 6 - 24 = -18. Correct.\n\nSecond component:\n\n6*(b × c)_y - 2*(a × b)_y - 3*(a × c)_y\n\n= 6*(-7) - 2*(-7) - 3*7 = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49. Correct.\n\nThird component:\n\n6*(b × c)_z - 2*(a × b)_z - 3*(a × c)_z\n\n= 6*18 - 2*3 - 3*2 = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96. Correct.\n\nTherefore, component-wise calculation also confirms the result. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\\\ -49 \\\\ 96 \\end{pmatrix}}\n</think>"}
