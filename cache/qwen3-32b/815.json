The question gives me options A to D, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me recall what I know about potentials for moving charges.\n\nFirst, I remember that for static charges, the scalar potential is just Coulomb's law, V = q/(4πε₀r), and the vector potential A is zero because there's no current. But here, the charge is moving, so things are more complicated. Since the charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), the potentials can't be static. Also, the problem mentions a retarded time tr, which suggests that we need to consider the finite speed of light, meaning the field at time t depends on the charge's position at an earlier time tr.\n\nRetarded potentials come into play here. From what I studied, the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let me try to recall their forms. \n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\nV(r, t) = [q / (4πε₀ (r - (v·r)/c))] evaluated at retarded time,\n\nand \n\nA(r, t) = [μ₀ q v c² ] / [4π (r - (v·r)/c))] evaluated at retarded time,\n\nWait, maybe I should check the exact expressions. Alternatively, since μ₀ ε₀ = 1/c², maybe there's a relation between the scalar and vector potentials here.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the vector potential A is related to the scalar potential by A = v V / c². Let me see. If that's the case, then if V is q/(4πε₀ r), then A would be (q v)/(4π ε₀ c² r). But that might be in the case where the velocity is constant? Or maybe that's in the non-relativistic case?\n\nBut the options given don't seem to have that denominator. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption B says V is same as Coulomb, and A is (v/c²) V. That would be A = (q v)/(4π ε₀ c² r). But I think this is only true for a charge moving at constant velocity, right? But the problem doesn't specify that the velocity is constant, just that at the retarded time tr, the velocity is v. However, the options don't include anything about the denominator depending on the velocity. So maybe the Liénard-Wiechert potentials have more complicated denominators?\n\nWait, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials have denominators involving (r - (v·r)/c), but maybe in some approximation?\n\nAlternatively, the general form of the potentials for a moving charge is:\n\nV(r, t) = [q / (4πε₀ (R - (v·R)/c))] evaluated at retarded time,\n\nwhere R is the distance from the charge's position at retarded time to the field point. Similarly, A is μ₀ q v / [4π (R - (v·R)/c))] evaluated at retarded time.\n\nBut in the problem, they define vector d as the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So R would be the magnitude of d, right? So if R is |d|, then maybe the denominator is (c |d| - v · d / c)? Wait, let me think.\n\nThe retarded time condition is that the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point divided by c equals t - tr. So, if the charge is at position s(tr), then the distance between s(tr) and r is |r - s(tr)| = |d| = R. Then, the retarded time condition is R = c(t - tr). However, if the charge is moving, then during the time it takes light to travel from the charge to the observation point, the charge has moved. So the denominator in the potentials might involve something like R(1 - v·n/c), where n is the unit vector in the direction from the charge to the observation point. So R(1 - (v·n)/c) = R - (v·R)/c. \n\nTherefore, the scalar potential would be V = q / [4πε₀ R (1 - (v·n)/c)] = q c / [4πε₀ (c R - v · R / c)] = q c / [4πε₀ (c R - v · d)]. Wait, since R is |d|, then c R - (v · d)/1? Wait, no, let me check units. The denominator in the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is R(1 - (v · n)/c). Let me write that as (R c - v · (R n)) / c. Since R n is the vector from the charge to the observation point, which is d. Therefore, denominator is (c R - v · d)/c. Therefore, the scalar potential is [q / (4πε₀ R)] * [c / (c R - v · d)]? Wait, no, let me do the algebra properly.\n\nOriginal Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential is:\n\nV = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot \\hat{R})}\n\nwhere β = v/c, and R is the distance at retarded time.\n\nSo, substituting β:\n\nV = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{R(1 - (\\vec{v}/c) \\cdot \\hat{R})} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q c}{c R - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{R}}.\n\nSince R is |d|, and d is the vector from charge to observation point, so R = |d|, and \\vec{R} = d. Therefore, denominator becomes c |d| - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}? Wait, but in the expression above, it's c R - v · R n? Wait, if R is |d|, then \\vec{R} = d, so the denominator is c R - v · d. Therefore, the scalar potential is:\n\nV = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (c R - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d})} = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (c |d| - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d})}\n\nBut in the options given, option D has denominator (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v). Wait, note that in the options, they use \"d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v\". However, in my expression, it's c |d| - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}. But if we take d in the options as |d|? Wait, the problem says \"d is the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time tr to the observation point r\". So d is a vector, and |d| is its magnitude. But in the options, they have \"d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v\". Wait, but d c would be a vector multiplied by c? No, if d is a vector, then \"d c\" would be a vector, but the dot product \\vec{d} \\cdot v is a scalar. So there's inconsistency in units unless \"d\" in the options is the magnitude. Maybe there's a typo or notation issue here.\n\nWait, looking at option D: denominator is (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v). If d here is the magnitude |d|, then dc is a scalar (units of length times speed), and \\vec{d} \\cdot v is also a scalar (units of speed times length). So units match. Therefore, assuming that in the options, \"d\" is the magnitude |d|, then the denominator would be c |d| - v · d, which matches the Liénard-Wiechert expression. Therefore, scalar potential would be q c / [4πε₀ (c |d| - v · d)] which is same as option D's V: qc / [4πε₀ (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v)]. So that matches. \n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential A, Liénard-Wiechert gives A = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c^2}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c R (1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{R}/c)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c R - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}. Since μ₀ ε₀ = 1/c², so μ₀ = 1/(ε₀ c²). Therefore, substituting into A:\n\nA = [ (1/(ε₀ c²)) * q c / 4π ] * [ \\vec{v} / (c R - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}) ) ] ?\n\nWait, let me do it step by step. The Liénard-Wiechert vector potential is:\n\nA = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{R}/c)}.\n\nSince 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀, so μ₀ = 1/(ε₀ c²). Therefore:\n\nA = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c^2} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{R}/c)}.\n\nBut the scalar potential V is \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{R}/c)}.\n\nTherefore, A = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V. Wait, that would be if the denominators are same. So A = (μ₀ q c² / 4π ) * [ ... ]? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIf A = μ₀ q / (4π) * [v / (R(1 - v·n/c))], and since μ₀ = 1/(ε₀ c²), then:\n\nA = [1/(ε₀ c²)] * [q / (4π) * v / (R(1 - v·n/c)) ].\n\nBut the scalar potential V is [1/(4π ε₀)] * [ q / (R(1 - v·n/c)) ].\n\nTherefore, A = [v / c² ] * [ q / (4π ε₀ R(1 - v·n/c)) ] = (v / c²) * V.\n\nWait, so if that's the case, then A is (v / c²) V. But this is only if the denominator is same for both potentials. But according to Liénard-Wiechert, that is the case. Therefore, if the scalar potential is V = q c / [4π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d)], then the vector potential A would be [v / c²] times V, which would be [q v / (4π ε₀ c² |d| - v · d) * c ]? Wait no:\n\nWait, if V = [q / (4π ε₀ R (1 - β·n))], and A = [μ₀ q v / (4π R (1 - β·n))], then since μ₀ = 1/(ε₀ c²), so A = [1/(ε₀ c²)] * [ q v / (4π R (1 - β·n)) ] = [v / c²] * [ q / (4π ε₀ R (1 - β·n)) ] * [c² / c²]? Wait no, let me compute:\n\nA = μ₀ q v / [4π R (1 - β·n)].\n\nSince μ₀ = 1/(ε₀ c²), then:\n\nA = [1/(ε₀ c²)] * [ q v / (4π R (1 - β·n)) ].\n\nBut V = [1/(4π ε₀)] * [ q / (R (1 - β·n)) ].\n\nTherefore, A = [v / c² ] * V. \n\nYes, exactly. Therefore, if the scalar potential is V, then vector potential is A = (v / c²) V. Therefore, if that is the case, then if V is given by option B, then A would be (v/c²) V. But in our case, the scalar potential is not the simple Coulomb potential, but the more complicated Liénard-Wiechert one. Therefore, options A and B are using the Coulomb potential, which would be only true for static charges or in the case where velocity is zero. But since the charge is moving, options C and D have the more complicated denominators. \n\nBut according to the above, if the scalar potential is the Liénard-Wiechert one (which is option D's V), then the vector potential is (v / c²) times that V. Let's check option D's A: it says μ₀ q c v / [4π (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v )]. Let me see if that equals (v / c²) times V.\n\nGiven V from option D is q c / [4π ε₀ (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v )], so (v / c²) * V would be [v / c²] * [ q c / (4π ε₀ (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v )) ] = q v / [4 π ε₀ c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v ) ].\n\nBut μ₀ is 1/(ε₀ c²), so μ₀ q c v / [4 π (d c - ... ) ] equals [1/(ε₀ c²)] * q c v / [4 π ( ... ) ] = q v / [4 π ε₀ c ( ... ) ], which matches the above. Therefore, A is indeed (v / c²) V, and also equals μ₀ q c v / [4 π ( ... ) ].\n\nTherefore, option D's expressions for both V and A are correct. \n\nBut let me check the sign in the denominator. In the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the denominator is (1 - β·n), which becomes (c R - v · d)/c R. Therefore, the denominator is c R - v · d. In option D, the denominator is (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v). Assuming that \"d\" in the option is the magnitude |d|, then yes, it's c |d| - v · d. So the sign is positive for the first term. Therefore, option D has denominator (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot v), which matches. \n\nBut wait, option C has (d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot v) in the denominator. If there was a plus sign, that would be problematic because if the charge is moving towards the observation point, then v · d would be negative (since d is from charge to observation point; if charge is moving towards observation point, then v is in direction opposite to d?), wait, let me think. Suppose the charge is moving towards the observation point. Then the vector d is pointing from the charge to the observation point. If the charge is moving towards the observation point, then its velocity v is in the same direction as -d (if it's moving directly towards the observation point). Therefore, v · d would be negative. Therefore, c |d| - v · d would be c |d| - (negative number) = c |d| + positive, which is larger. But if there was a plus sign in the denominator, like in option C, then it would be c |d| + v · d. If the charge is moving away, then v · d is positive, so denominator is larger. If moving towards, then v · d is negative, denominator becomes smaller. But in the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the denominator is 1 - β·n. If the charge is moving towards the observer, β·n is negative, so 1 - β·n becomes 1 + |β·n|, making the denominator larger, hence potentials smaller. Which makes sense because if the charge is moving towards you, the effective distance is increased in the denominator? Wait, actually, the denominator in V is R(1 - β·n). If β·n is negative, then 1 - β·n becomes 1 + positive, so the denominator is larger, hence V is smaller. That seems counterintuitive? Wait, maybe not. Because if the charge is moving towards the observer, the light it emits takes less time to reach the observer, so the retarded position is closer? Hmm, maybe I need not get bogged down here. The key is that according to the derivation, the correct denominator is (c |d| - v · d), which is option D. Option C has a plus sign, which would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D. \n\nBut let me check options B and D. Option B says V is Coulomb and A is (v/c²) V. But that would be neglecting the relativistic effects in the denominator. So unless the charge is moving at non-relativistic speeds and we are in a certain approximation, but the question doesn't specify any approximation. Since the problem mentions retarded time and the vector d, it implies that we need the exact expressions, which would be Liénard-Wiechert, hence option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
