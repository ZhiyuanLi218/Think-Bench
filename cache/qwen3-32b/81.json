However, this is **not accurate**. $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$ is a **weak diprotic acid**, meaning it ionizes in **two steps**, and **not completely**:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^+ + \\mathrm{HS}^-\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{HS}^- \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^+ + \\mathrm{S}^{2-}\n$$\n\nEach step is **partial** and **reversible**, and the second ionization is especially weak.

The **s-block** of the periodic table includes elements from **Groups 1 and 2**, while the **p-block** starts at **Group 13** and ends at **Group 18**.\n\nSince sodium is in **Group 1**, it is located in the **s-block**, **not** the **p-block**.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Spatial Structure of $\\mathrm{CO}_3^{2-}$**\nThe **carbonate ion** has a central carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. Due to **resonance**, all C–O bonds are equivalent. The carbon atom has **three bonding regions** (no lone pairs), leading to a **trigonal planar geometry**.\n\nThis is consistent with **VSEPR theory**, where a central atom with three bonding pairs and no lone pairs gives rise to a **trigonal planar** shape.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Correct**\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Electron Dot Structure of $\\mathrm{KOH}$**\n$\\mathrm{KOH}$ is an **ionic compound** composed of $\\mathrm{K}^+$ and $\\mathrm{OH}^-$ ions. The $\\mathrm{OH}^-$ ion has a central oxygen atom with **three lone pairs** and a **single bond to hydrogen**, along with a **negative charge**.\n\nThe given structure: $\\mathrm{K}: \\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}: \\mathrm{H}_-$ appears to misrepresent the **electron distribution** and **ionic nature** of the compound. The notation suggests a covalent bond between K and O, which is incorrect in ionic compounds. Also, the subscript on H is incorrectly written as $\\mathrm{H}_-$, suggesting a hydride ion, which is not the case in $\\mathrm{OH}^-$.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out which of the options A to D are correct. Let me take each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: It says that H2S ionizes into 2H+ and S^2-. Hmm, I remember that H2S is a weak acid, right? But does it really dissociate completely into two H+ and S^2-? Wait, I think H2S is a diprotic acid, but it actually ionizes in two steps. First, it loses one H+ to form HS^- and H+, and then HS^- can lose another H+ to form S^2- and another H+. However, both steps are weak and don't go to completion. So the overall reaction would be H2S ⇌ 2H+ + S^2-, but the problem is whether the question is stating this as a correct ionization. The problem is that the way it's written here is as a direct dissociation into 2H+ and S^2-, but in reality, the second ionization is even weaker. But maybe in some contexts, people still write the overall dissociation like that. However, I think the main issue here is that H2S doesn't really produce S^2- in significant amounts because the second ionization is very small. So maybe option A is incorrect because it's not the correct way to represent the ionization. Maybe they should write the two steps separately. So I think A is wrong.\n\nMoving on to option B: Na is in the p block. Sodium is in group 1, which is the alkali metals. The s-block includes groups 1 and 2. The p-block starts from group 13 to 18. So sodium is in the s-block. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: CO3^2- spatial structure is trigonal planar. Let me recall the structure of carbonate ion. The carbonate ion has a central carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. The Lewis structure shows that carbon has a double bond with one oxygen and single bonds with the other two, which have negative charges. However, due to resonance, all the C-O bonds are equivalent. The geometry around the central carbon atom is trigonal planar because there are three regions of electron density (three bonding pairs and no lone pairs on the central atom). So the shape is trigonal planar. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nOption D: KOH's electron dot structure is written as K:Ö: H. Wait, the electron dot structure for KOH. KOH is an ionic compound composed of K+ and OH- ions. The OH- ion has a lone pair on oxygen and a single bond to H. The correct electron dot structure for OH- would be O with two lone pairs (assuming the Lewis structure) and a single bond to H, plus a negative charge. But the way it's written here is K:Ö:H. The colons around O might indicate that there are lone pairs, but the notation is a bit unclear. However, the way it's written might be implying that the oxygen has two dots (maybe a double bond?), but in reality, in OH-, oxygen has three lone pairs. Also, the formula written as K:Ö:H might not be correctly representing the ionic bond. Since KOH is ionic, it's K+ and [OH]-. The electron dot structure for the hydroxide ion would be O with three lone pairs and a single bond to H, with a negative charge. The K+ ion is separate. The notation given in D seems to have K connected with a colon to O, which might be trying to show the ionic bond, but the rest of the structure might be incorrect. Also, the subscript on H is written as H- which is incorrect because H in OH- is not a hydride ion. So I think option D is incorrect. The correct electron dot structure should show the OH- ion properly, with oxygen having three lone pairs and a single bond to H, and the K+ ion nearby. The given notation seems to have mistakes, so D is incorrect.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nA: Incorrect because H2S doesn't fully dissociate into 2H+ and S^2-; the correct ionization is stepwise and partial.\n\nB: Incorrect because Na is in the s-block.\n\nC: Correct, carbonate ion is trigonal planar.\n\nD: Incorrect because the electron dot structure is not properly represented.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>"}
