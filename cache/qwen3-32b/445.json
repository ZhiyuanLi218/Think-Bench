I need to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. Optical activity is due to the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So, for each compound listed, I need to check if there are any chiral centers or if the molecule is chiral in some other way, like in allenes or certain cyclic structures.\n\nStarting with the first one: 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. Let me visualize this. There's a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group at position 1 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 4. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is like an allene? Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH2-) attached? Maybe I need to draw the structure. Alternatively, maybe there's a chiral center in the substituent. Let me think: the prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=C(CH2-). Wait, if the substituent is attached to the cyclohexene ring, maybe the carbon where the substituent is attached is a chiral center. The cyclohexene ring has a methyl at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. Let me consider the substituent. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=C(CH2R). If the substituent is attached to the cyclohexene ring, the carbon at position 4 of the cyclohexene is connected to a CH2 group (from the prop-1-en-2-yl), a methyl group (from the cyclohexene ring), and the ring itself. Wait, maybe the carbon at position 4 is connected to four different groups? Let me check. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between 1 and 2. Position 4 is adjacent to position 3 and 5. If there's a methyl group at position 1 and a substituent at 4, the carbon at 4 is part of the ring. Hmm, maybe the substituent has a chiral center. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=C(R)-, where R is connected to the ring. The central carbon in the prop-1-en-2-yl is the one attached to the ring. Let me think: the structure would be CH2=C(CH2-Ring). The central carbon here (the one with the double bond) is connected to two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(R)-CH2? No, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2-), meaning the substituent is CH2=C(CH2-). Wait, maybe I need to parse the name. Prop-1-en-2-yl is an allene? Or maybe a vinyl group? Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be like CH2=CH-CH2-? No, prop-1-en-2-yl is a substituent. The parent chain is prop-1-ene, and the substituent is at position 2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-? But if the substituent is attached at position 2, then it's CH2=CH-CH2-? Wait, maybe I need to think of it as a CH2=C(R) group. For example, if the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl attached to the cyclohexene, then the substituent is CH2=C(CH2-Ring). The central carbon (the one with the double bond) has two CH2 groups attached? No, if it's CH2=C(CH2-Ring), then the central carbon has one CH2, one CH2-Ring, and the double bond. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if there's a chiral center in this compound. The cyclohexene ring has a methyl at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. The substituent is a prop-1-en-2-yl group. The carbon at position 4 of the cyclohexene is attached to the ring (so two ring carbons), a methyl group (from the ring?), no. Wait, position 1 has a methyl group. Position 4 has a substituent. The carbon at position 4 is part of the ring, so it's connected to two ring carbons (positions 3 and 5), and the substituent. Wait, the substituent is a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is CH2=C(CH2-). So the carbon at position 4 is connected to a CH2=C(CH2-), a ring carbon (position 3), another ring carbon (position 5), and maybe a hydrogen? Wait, no. The cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond between 1 and 2. Position 4 would have a substituent. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is a CH2=C(CH2-). So the carbon at position 4 is connected to the ring (so two ring carbons), the CH2 group of the substituent, and maybe a hydrogen? Wait, if the substituent is attached via a double bond? No, substituents are usually attached via single bonds. So maybe the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a double bond. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider the possibility of a chiral center in the substituent. The prop-1-en-2-yl group has a central carbon (the one with the double bond) connected to two CH2 groups and the ring? No, if the substituent is CH2=C(R)-, then the central carbon is connected to one CH2 group, one R group (which is the ring), and the double bond. Wait, maybe there's a chiral center in the substituent. Let me think: the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2=C(CH2-). If the substituent is attached to the ring at the CH2=C(CH2-), then the carbon that's connected to the ring (the CH2) is part of the substituent. The central carbon (the one with the double bond) is connected to a CH2 group (which is attached to the ring) and a CH2 group? No, maybe it's CH2=C(R)-, where R is connected to the ring. Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2=C(R)-, and the R is the ring. So the central carbon is connected to a CH2, a CH2, and the ring? No, that can't be. Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's move on and come back.\n\nSecond compound: 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene. Structure: CH2=CF-CF2F? Wait, the name is 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene. Let me parse the name. The parent chain is prop-1-ene (CH2=CH-CH2-). The substituents are four fluorines at positions 2, 3, 3, 3. So position 2 is the first carbon after the double bond (since it's prop-1-ene, the double bond is between 1 and 2). Wait, in prop-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-. Position 2 is the second carbon (the one with the double bond), and position 3 is the third carbon. So 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro means fluorines at positions 2, 3 (three times). So the structure is CH2=CF-CHF2? Wait, no. Let me think. If it's prop-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-. Position 2 is the second carbon (the one with the double bond), and position 3 is the third carbon. The substituents are fluorines. So 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro would mean fluorine at position 2 (on the second carbon) and three fluorines at position 3. So the second carbon (which is part of the double bond) has one fluorine, and the third carbon has three fluorines. So the structure would be CH2=CF-CHF3? Wait, but prop-1-ene has three carbons. So the third carbon is CH2-, but with three fluorines. So the structure is CH2=CF-CHF3? However, the third carbon can't have three fluorines and a hydrogen. Wait, no. The third carbon would be CF3 group. So the structure is CH2=CF-CHF3? But that would have a CF3 group on the third carbon. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's check. The second carbon (part of the double bond) has a double bond, so it's sp² hybridized, not a chiral center. The third carbon has three fluorines and one substituent. Wait, the third carbon is connected to the second carbon (which is CH=CF-), and the third carbon is CF3? So it's connected to three F atoms and one carbon (the second carbon). Since it's connected to three identical groups (three F) and one carbon, it's not a chiral center. So this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Also, check for other types of chirality, like allenes or helical structures. But this is a simple molecule with a double bond and CF3 group. Probably no chirality. So this compound is not optically active.\n\nThird compound: di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane. Let me parse this. The parent is methane, with two cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene groups attached to the two carbons. So the structure is (cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)2CH2? Wait, no. Di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane would be CH(Cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)2? Wait, maybe it's a methylene bridge between two cyclohex-2-en-1-yl groups. So the structure is two cyclohexene rings connected by a methylene group. Let me think: cyclohex-2-en-1-yl is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between 2 and 3 (since it's cyclohex-2-ene) and the substituent at position 1. So each cyclohex-2-en-1-yl group is connected via the methylene group. So the molecule is like two cyclohexene rings connected by a CH2 group. Now, is this molecule chiral? It depends on the symmetry. If the two cyclohexene rings are identical and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. But if the rings are different or arranged asymmetrically, it could be chiral. However, since both substituents are the same (both cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene groups), the molecule is likely symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral. Unless there's a chiral center in the rings themselves. But each cyclohexene ring is just a simple ring with a double bond. No chiral centers. So this compound is not optically active.\n\nFourth compound: 5-(5-methylhexan-2-ylidene)cyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me try to visualize this. The parent is cyclopenta-1,3-diene, which is a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. At position 5, there's a substituent: 5-methylhexan-2-ylidene. The substituent is a hexan-2-ylidene group with a methyl at position 5. Wait, the substituent is 5-methylhexan-2-ylidene. Let me parse this: hexan-2-ylidene is a CH2 group attached at position 2 of hexane. But with a methyl group at position 5. So the substituent is a CH2 group connected to the cyclopentadiene ring, and the rest of the chain is a hexane with a methyl at position 5. Let me think of the structure. The substituent is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, since it's hexan-2-ylidene. The parent is hexane, with a substituent at position 2 (ylidene, meaning double bond?), but the name is 5-methylhexan-2-ylidene. Maybe it's a CH2 group attached to the cyclopentadiene ring, and the rest of the chain is hexane with a methyl at position 5. The key is whether there's a chiral center. The substituent is a hexyl group with a methyl at position 5. Let me consider the carbon chain. The substituent is attached to the cyclopentadiene at position 2 of the hexane chain. The hexane chain has a methyl at position 5. So the carbon at position 2 of the hexane is connected to the cyclopentadiene ring. The rest of the chain is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, if it's 5-methylhexan-2-ylidene, then the hexane has a methyl at position 5. The structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? But since it's ylidene, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- with a double bond? Wait, no. The term \"ylidene\" usually indicates a =CH2 group. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The substituent is 5-methylhexan-2-ylidene. The \"ylidene\" part might mean that the substituent is attached via a double bond. So the structure is cyclopentadiene ring connected via a double bond to a 5-methylhexane-2-yl group. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me focus on potential chiral centers. The substituent is a hexane chain with a methyl at position 5. The carbon at position 2 of the hexane is connected to the cyclopentadiene ring. The rest of the chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? The carbon at position 2 of the hexane is connected to the ring, and the rest of the chain. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 2 of the hexane: if it's connected to the ring, a CH2 group (position 1), a CH2 group (position 3), and maybe a hydrogen? No, if it's part of a hexane chain, then position 2 is connected to position 1 (CH2), position 3 (CH2), and the ring. Wait, if the substituent is attached at position 2, then position 2 is connected to the ring, position 1 (CH2), and position 3 (CH2). So three different groups? The ring, a CH2 (position 1), and another CH2 (position 3). But if the rest of the chain is symmetric? Wait, the chain is 5-methylhexane. So from position 2, the chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, since it's a hexane with a methyl at position 5. Let me think of the chain as positions 1 to 6. The substituent is attached at position 2, and there's a methyl at position 5. So position 2 is connected to the cyclopentadiene ring. The rest of the chain is: position 1 (CH2), position 2 (connected to ring), position 3 (CH2), position 4 (CH2), position 5 (CH(CH3)), position 6 (CH2-? But since it's a substituent attached via position 2, the chain is from position 2 to position 6. Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the cyclopentadiene ring at position 2. The carbon at position 2 is connected to the ring, a CH2 (position 1), and another CH2 (position 3). So if position 1 is CH2 and position 3 is CH2, then the carbon at position 2 is connected to two CH2 groups and the ring. Unless there's something else. Wait, maybe there's a double bond in the substituent? Because of the \"ylidene\" in the name. If the substituent is a ylidene group, that would imply a =CH2 group. So maybe the substituent is attached via a double bond. So the structure is cyclopentadiene connected via a double bond to a 5-methylhexane-2-yl group. In that case, the carbon at position 2 would have a double bond to the cyclopentadiene ring. But that might not introduce a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the substituent has a chiral center. Let's consider the carbon at position 5 of the hexane chain, which has a methyl group. That carbon is connected to a CH2 (position 4), a CH2 (position 6), and a methyl group. If position 5 is CH(CH3), then that carbon is connected to three different groups? Wait, position 5 is CH(CH3)-CH2-? So the carbon at position 5 has a methyl group, a CH2 group (position 4), and another CH2 group (position 6). Wait, no. Let me think again. The chain is 5-methylhexane. So positions 1-6: position 5 has a methyl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. If the substituent is attached at position 2, then the carbon at position 2 is connected to the cyclopentadiene ring. The rest of the chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. The carbon at position 5 (CH(CH3)) is connected to CH2 (position 4), CH3 (position 6), and a methyl group. So the carbon at position 5 is connected to two CH2 groups? Wait, position 5 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to position 4 (CH2), position 6 (CH3), and a methyl group. Therefore, the carbon at position 5 is connected to three different groups: CH2 (position 4), CH3 (position 6), and another CH3 (the methyl substituent). Wait, no. If the carbon is CH(CH3), then it has one CH2 (from position 4), one CH3 (from position 6), and one CH3 (the substituent). So three groups: CH2, CH3, CH3. Since two of the groups are the same (two CH3), this carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, no chiral centers in this substituent. So the entire compound may not be optically active. Unless there's some other chirality. Maybe the cyclopentadiene ring has a chiral arrangement? But it's just a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. No chiral centers. So this compound is not optically active.\n\nFifth compound: 3-(2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene)cyclohex-1-ene. Let me parse this. The parent is cyclohex-1-ene (a six-membered ring with a double bond between 1 and 2). At position 3, there's a substituent: 2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene. The substituent is a but-1-en-1-ylidene group with a methyl at position 2. Let me think about the structure of the substituent. But-1-en-1-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, the \"ylidene\" part usually indicates a =CH2 group. Wait, the name is 2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene. Let's break it down. The parent is but-1-ene, which is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. The substituent is at position 1 (ylidene), so maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? But with a methyl at position 2. The substituent is 2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene. So the structure is CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-? Attached as a substituent via the =CH2? Wait, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexene ring, with the rest of the chain being CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-? Hmm. Let me try to focus on potential chiral centers. The substituent is a butyl group with a methyl at position 2. The structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-? But attached via a double bond (ylidene). So the substituent is CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-? If the substituent is attached to the cyclohexene ring at the =CH2 end, then the carbon at position 2 (the one with the methyl) is connected to two CH2 groups, a methyl, and the ring? Wait, maybe there's a chiral center in the substituent. Let's consider the carbon with the methyl group (position 2 of the butyl chain). If that carbon is connected to a CH2 (position 1), a CH2 (position 3), a methyl group, and maybe a hydrogen? Let's see: the structure is CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-... The carbon at position 2 (the one with the methyl) is connected to a double bond (CH2=), a CH2 group (position 3), and a methyl group. Wait, no. The structure is CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-... The carbon with the methyl is the second carbon of the butyl chain. Let me write it out: the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-... But since it's but-1-en-1-ylidene, maybe it's CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-... So the carbon at position 2 (the one with the methyl) is connected to a CH2 (from the double bond?), a CH2 (position 3), and a methyl group. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of the substituent as CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-... The carbon with the methyl is the one in the middle. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon with the methyl is connected to: a CH2 (from the double bond?), a CH2 (position 3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen? If yes, then that carbon is connected to four different groups: CH2 (double bond?), CH2 (position 3), methyl, and hydrogen. That would make it a chiral center. So if that's the case, then this compound has a chiral center in the substituent, making it optically active. So this compound is optically active. Let me verify. The substituent is 2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene. The structure would be CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-... The carbon at position 2 (the one with the methyl) is connected to a CH2 (from the double bond), a CH2 (position 3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Yes, that's four different groups. Therefore, a chiral center exists here. So this compound is optically active.\n\nSixth compound: [1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diol. This is a biphenyl compound with hydroxyl groups at positions 3 on both phenyl rings. Let me visualize this. Two benzene rings connected at the 1,1' positions (so the central carbon is connected to two phenyl rings). Each phenyl ring has a hydroxyl group at position 3. Now, is this compound chiral? Biphenyls can sometimes be chiral if there's restricted rotation and the two rings are not symmetrical. However, in this case, the diol is symmetric. The hydroxyl groups are at the same position on both rings. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. Let me think: if both rings have a hydroxyl at position 3, then the molecule is symmetric with respect to swapping the two rings. Therefore, it's not chiral. However, sometimes in biphenyls, if there's no symmetry and restricted rotation, the molecule can be chiral. But in this case, since the substituents are symmetric, the molecule is not chiral. So this compound is not optically active.\n\nSeventh compound: 8,8-dichlorobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. Let me try to draw this. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octane is a bicyclic compound with a bridge of 4 carbons, another bridge of 2 carbons, and a zero-length bridge (a bridgehead carbon). The structure is like a norbornane derivative. The numbering is such that the bridgehead carbons are connected by the 4 and 2 bridges. The compound has two chlorine atoms at position 8 and a ketone group at position 7. Wait, the numbering might be tricky. Let me think: in bicyclo[4.2.0]octane, the structure is a central carbon connected to two rings. The numbering starts at one bridgehead, goes through the 4-carbon bridge, then the 2-carbon bridge, and back. Position 7 and 8 would be specific positions. The ketone is at position 7, and two chlorines at position 8. Now, is this compound chiral? Let me consider the structure. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octane has a central carbon (bridgehead) and two other bridgeheads. Adding two chlorines at position 8 and a ketone at 7. If the two chlorines are on the same carbon (position 8), then that carbon is connected to two chlorines, a carbon from the ring, and another carbon. Wait, position 8 would be a bridgehead carbon? Or maybe it's a carbon in the ring. Let me think of the structure. In bicyclo[4.2.0]octane, there are two bridgeheads connected by a 4-carbon bridge and a 2-carbon bridge. The numbering is such that the bridgeheads are positions 1 and 8 (assuming the standard numbering). The ketone is at position 7, and two chlorines at position 8. Position 8 is a bridgehead carbon. If there are two chlorines on position 8, then that carbon is connected to two chlorines, a carbon from the 4-carbon bridge, and a carbon from the 2-carbon bridge. Wait, but two chlorines on the same carbon would make it connected to two identical groups (Cl), so not a chiral center. However, maybe there's another chiral center. The ketone is at position 7. Let me think about the structure. The ketone group is on a carbon in the ring. Depending on the substituents around that carbon, it might be a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center due to the arrangement of substituents. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral due to the presence of two different substituents on the bridgehead. Wait, but position 8 has two chlorines. If the molecule is symmetric, it might not be chiral. However, if the two chlorines are on different bridgeheads? Wait, no, it's 8,8-dichloro, so both chlorines are on position 8. So position 8 has two chlorines. If the rest of the molecule is symmetric, then it's not chiral. However, if the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, it might be chiral. Let me consider the possibility of a chiral center. The carbon at position 8 has two chlorines, so it's not a chiral center. The ketone at position 7: let's check that carbon. The ketone is a carbonyl group, so the carbon is double bonded to oxygen, making it sp² hybridized, not a chiral center. Therefore, no chiral centers in this compound. However, sometimes in bicyclic compounds, even without chiral centers, the molecule can be chiral due to the overall shape (like in allenes or helical structures). But in this case, since the two chlorines are on the same carbon and the molecule is symmetric, it's likely not chiral. So this compound is not optically active.\n\nEighth compound: cyclopent-2-en-1-one. This is a five-membered ring with a double bond between 2 and 3, and a ketone group at position 1. The structure is a cyclopentenone. Is this compound chiral? The ketone is at position 1, and there's a double bond between 2 and 3. Let me check for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized, not a chiral center. The other carbons in the ring: the double bond between 2 and 3. The carbon at position 1 is connected to two ring carbons (positions 2 and 5) and the oxygen. The ring is symmetric? If there are no substituents other than the ketone and the double bond, then the molecule is likely planar and has a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.\n\nNow, let me recap the compounds and their optical activity:\n\n1. 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene: Earlier I was confused, but let's go back. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. The carbon at position 4 of the cyclohexene ring is connected to a CH2=C(R) group. The central carbon in the substituent (the one with the double bond) is connected to a CH2 group (from the ring?), a CH2 group (from the substituent?), and the ring? Wait, maybe there's a chiral center in the substituent. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=C(R)-CH2-? If the substituent is attached via the CH2=C(R), then the central carbon (the one with the double bond) is connected to a CH2 group (from the ring?), a CH2 group (from the substituent?), and maybe a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. Prop-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-. The 2-yl part means the substituent is attached at position 2. So the substituent is CH2=C(CH2-). So the structure is CH2=C(CH2-Ring). The central carbon (the one with the double bond) is connected to a CH2 group (position 1 of the propyl chain), a CH2 group (position 3 of the propyl chain, which is attached to the ring?), and the ring? Wait, the substituent is attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 4. So the structure is cyclohexene ring with a CH2=C(CH2-Ring). The central carbon (the one with the double bond) is connected to a CH2 group (from the propyl chain), a CH2 group (attached to the ring?), and the ring itself? No, maybe the central carbon is connected to a CH2 group (from the ring?), a CH2 group (from the propyl chain), and a hydrogen? Let me try to see if this carbon is a chiral center. If the central carbon is connected to a CH2 group (from the propyl chain), a CH2 group (attached to the ring), and two different groups? Wait, if the central carbon is part of a double bond, it's sp² hybridized, not a chiral center. Therefore, no chiral center here. Then, the cyclohexene ring has a methyl at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. The carbon at position 1 has a methyl group, and the carbon at position 4 has a substituent. The ring itself: is there a chiral center? The cyclohexene ring with substituents at 1 and 4. The carbon at position 1 has a methyl group, and the carbon at position 4 has a substituent. The rest of the ring is just hydrogen and ring bonds. Let me check if the carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The carbon at position 4 is part of the ring. It is connected to two ring carbons (positions 3 and 5), a substituent (prop-1-en-2-yl group), and a hydrogen? If yes, then it's connected to four different groups? Let's see: two ring carbons (positions 3 and 5), a substituent (prop-1-en-2-yl), and a hydrogen. If positions 3 and 5 are different, then yes. Let me consider the cyclohexene ring. The ring has a double bond between 1 and 2. Position 1 has a methyl group. Position 4 has a substituent. The ring is numbered 1 (methyl), 2 (double bond), 3, 4 (substituent), 5, 6. The carbon at position 4 is connected to position 3 and 5. Let's see what those positions are. Position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (double bond) and position 4. Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and position 6. Since the ring has a double bond between 1 and 2, the rest of the ring is single bonds. The carbon at position 4 is connected to position 3 (which is a CH2 group?), position 5 (another CH2 group?), the substituent, and a hydrogen. Wait, if the ring is cyclohexene, with a double bond between 1 and 2, then positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 are single bonds. The carbon at position 4 is connected to position 3 (a CH2 group?), position 5 (a CH2 group?), the substituent, and a hydrogen. If positions 3 and 5 are both CH2 groups, then the carbon at position 4 is connected to two CH2 groups, a substituent, and a hydrogen. Therefore, it has two identical groups (the two CH2s?), making it not a chiral center. Wait, unless the substituent makes one of the CH2 groups different. For example, if the substituent at position 4 affects the structure of the ring. But in reality, the substituent is attached to position 4, but positions 3 and 5 are still part of the ring. So unless the substituent causes positions 3 and 5 to have different substituents, they remain the same. Therefore, the carbon at position 4 is connected to two CH2 groups (positions 3 and 5), the substituent, and a hydrogen. Since two CH2 groups are the same, this carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, this compound doesn't have a chiral center. Hence, not optically active.\n\nSo, summarizing all eight compounds:\n\n1. 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene: No chiral center. Not optically active.\n\n2. 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene: No chiral center. Not optically active.\n\n3. Di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane: Symmetrical. Not optically active.\n\n4. 5-(5-methylhexan-2-ylidene)cyclopenta-1,3-diene: No chiral center. Not optically active.\n\n5. 3-(2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene)cyclohex-1-ene: Chiral center in substituent. Optically active.\n\n6. [1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diol: Symmetrical. Not optically active.\n\n7. 8,8-dichlorobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one: No chiral center. Not optically active.\n\n8. Cyclopent-2-en-1-one: No chiral center. Not optically active.\n\nWait, that gives only one compound (compound 5) as optically active. But the options are A:6, B:5, C:4, D:3. Clearly, I must have made a mistake in evaluating some compounds.\n\nLet me go back and check each one again.\n\nFirst compound: 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. Maybe there's a chiral center I missed. Let me try again. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. The structure is CH2=C(CH2-Ring). The central carbon (the one with the double bond) is part of the substituent. Is there a chiral center there? The central carbon is connected to a CH2 group (from the propyl chain), a CH2 group (attached to the ring?), and a double bond? No, it's part of a double bond, so it's sp². Not a chiral center. What about the carbon at position 1 of the cyclohexene ring? It has a methyl group. That carbon is connected to a ring carbon (position 2), another ring carbon (position 6), the methyl group, and a hydrogen. Wait, position 1 is part of the ring and has a methyl group. The carbon at position 1 is connected to: two ring carbons (positions 2 and 6), the methyl group, and a hydrogen. Are those four groups different? The two ring carbons are positions 2 and 6. In a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, position 2 is part of the double bond. Position 6 is a single bond. So the carbon at position 1 is connected to position 2 (double bond), position 6 (single bond), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Therefore, the four groups are: double bond (position 2), single bond to position 6, methyl, and hydrogen. Are these four different? The double bond and single bond are different, the methyl and hydrogen are different. So yes, the carbon at position 1 has four different groups: two ring connections (one double bond, one single bond), methyl, and hydrogen. Wait, but the two ring connections are both to the same ring. However, the nature of the bonds (single vs. double) makes them different. So the carbon at position 1 is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is optically active. I missed this earlier. So compound 1 is optically active.\n\nLet me check again. The carbon at position 1 of the cyclohexene ring has a methyl group. The ring has a double bond between 1 and 2. The carbon at position 1 is connected to:\n\n- Position 2: a carbon with a double bond.\n\n- Position 6: a carbon with a single bond.\n\n- A methyl group.\n\n- A hydrogen.\n\nYes, these are four different groups. The two ring connections are different (one double bond, one single bond), the methyl, and the hydrogen. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Hence, compound 1 is optically active.\n\nThat changes the count. Now, compounds 1 and 5 are optically active. Let's check others again.\n\nCompound 4: 5-(5-methylhexan-2-ylidene)cyclopenta-1,3-diene. Earlier, I thought no chiral center. Let me re-examine. The substituent is a hexane chain with a methyl at position 5. The carbon at position 2 of the hexane is connected to the cyclopentadiene ring. The rest of the chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? The carbon at position 5 is CH(CH3). Is that a chiral center? If the carbon is connected to a CH2 (position 4), a CH2 (position 6), and a methyl group, then it's connected to three different groups? No, two CH2 groups and a methyl. Therefore, not a chiral center. But what about the carbon at position 2 of the hexane? It's connected to the ring, a CH2 (position 1), and a CH2 (position 3). If the rest of the chain is asymmetric, maybe that carbon is a chiral center? Let me see: the carbon at position 2 is connected to the ring, a CH2 (position 1), and a CH2 (position 3). If the chain beyond position 3 is different from position 1, then it might be a chiral center. Position 1 is CH2, position 3 is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, the chain from position 2 is asymmetric because of the methyl at position 5. Therefore, the carbon at position 2 is connected to the ring, a CH2 group (position 1), and a CH2 group (position 3), which is part of an asymmetric chain. Therefore, the four groups are: ring, CH2 (position 1), CH2 (position 3), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. The carbon at position 2 of the hexane is part of the chain. If it's connected to the ring at one end and the rest of the chain at the other, then it's connected to:\n\n- The ring.\n\n- A CH2 group (position 1).\n\n- A CH2 group (position 3).\n\n- A hydrogen?\n\nWait, no. In a hexane chain, each carbon is connected to two other carbons. If the substituent is attached at position 2, then the carbon at position 2 is connected to position 1 (CH2), position 3 (CH2), and the ring. But since it's a substituent attached to the cyclopentadiene ring, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to the ring? No, the substituent is a ylidene group, implying a double bond. This is getting too complicated. Let me try to think if there's a chiral center. If the substituent has a methyl at position 5, and the rest of the chain is asymmetric, maybe the carbon at position 3 or 4 is a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentadiene ring has a chiral arrangement. But I don't see it. Maybe this compound is not optically active.\n\nCompound 7: 8,8-dichlorobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. Earlier, I thought no chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is a bicyclic compound with two chlorines at position 8 and a ketone at 7. Position 8 has two chlorines. If the rest of the molecule is asymmetric, maybe there's a chiral center. However, position 8 has two identical substituents (Cl), so it can't be a chiral center. The ketone at 7 is a carbonyl group, not a chiral center. What about other carbons? The bridgehead carbon at position 8 has two chlorines, but the other bridgehead might have different substituents? If the molecule is symmetric, it's not chiral. But if it's asymmetric, maybe it is. However, since both chlorines are on the same carbon, it's likely symmetric. Therefore, not optically active.\n\nCompound 3: di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane. Two cyclohexene rings connected by a methylene group. If the rings are identical and the molecule is symmetrical, it's not chiral. But if there's a chiral center in the methylene? No, methylene is CH2. Unless the methylene is part of an allene or something. But no, it's a simple CH2 group. So not chiral.\n\nCompound 6: [1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diol. Symmetric with hydroxyl groups on both rings. Not chiral.\n\nCompound 8: cyclopent-2-en-1-one. No chiral center.\n\nSo now, compounds 1 and 5 are optically active. Let me check if there are others.\n\nCompound 2: 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene. No chiral center.\n\nCompound 4: Still no.\n\nWait, maybe I missed another chiral center in compound 1. The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center. Are there any others? The substituent at position 4 is prop-1-en-2-yl. The substituent has a central carbon with a double bond. No chiral centers there. So only one chiral center in compound 1.\n\nCompound 5: has a chiral center in the substituent. So two compounds so far.\n\nLet me check compound 7 again. Maybe there's a chiral center I missed. The ketone at position 7. The carbon at position 7 is the carbonyl carbon, not a chiral center. Other carbons? Let's consider the structure. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octane has bridgehead carbons. Position 8 has two chlorines. The other bridgehead (position 1?) has no substituents. The molecule might have a chiral center due to the arrangement of substituents. For example, if the two chlorines are on one bridgehead and the ketone on another, creating asymmetry. But since there are two chlorines on the same bridgehead, and the molecule is symmetric? It depends on the exact structure. If the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, it might be chiral. However, without a chiral center, it's usually not chiral. I think it's not optically active.\n\nWait, what about compound 4? Let me try again. The substituent is 5-methylhexan-2-ylidene. The hexane chain has a methyl at position 5. The carbon at position 5 is CH(CH3). Is that a chiral center? Let's see: the carbon at position 5 is connected to position 4 (CH2), position 6 (CH2), and a methyl group. If position 4 and 6 are different, then it could be a chiral center. If position 4 is CH2 and position 6 is CH2, then it's connected to two CH2 groups and a methyl. Not a chiral center. Unless position 6 has a different group. Wait, the substituent is attached via position 2 of the hexane. The chain is from position 2 to position 6. Position 2 is connected to the cyclopentadiene ring. The rest of the chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? If the substituent is attached via a double bond (ylidene), then maybe the carbon at position 2 has a double bond to the ring. But I'm not sure. Let's assume it's a single bond. The carbon at position 5 is CH(CH3), connected to position 4 (CH2), position 6 (CH2), and a methyl. If position 6 is CH2 and there's no other substituent, then it's not a chiral center. Therefore, compound 4 is not optically active.\n\nSo total of two compounds so far. But the options start at D:3. Maybe I missed another.\n\nLet me check compound 3: di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane. Two cyclohexene rings connected by a methylene group. If the two cyclohexene rings are identical, it's symmetrical. But if the methylene is between two different groups? No, since they're the same. Not chiral.\n\nCompound 7: No.\n\nCompound 8: No.\n\nWait, what about compound 3? Is there a possibility of allene chirality? For example, if the molecule has a central carbon with two double bonds (an allene) and different substituents on each double bond. But di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane is CH(Cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)2? No, it's methane with two cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene groups. The structure is CH2 connected to two cyclohexene rings. No allene structure. Not chiral.\n\nMaybe compound 5: 3-(2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene)cyclohex-1-ene. Earlier I said it has a chiral center in the substituent. Let me confirm again. The substituent is 2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene. The structure is CH2=CH(CH3)-CH2-... The carbon at position 2 (the one with the methyl) is connected to a CH2 (from the double bond), a CH2 (position 3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Yes, four different groups. Chiral center. So this compound is optically active.\n\nWhat about compound 4? Let me think of another possibility. The substituent is 5-methylhexan-2-ylidene. The hexane chain has a methyl at position 5. The carbon at position 2 of the hexane is connected to the cyclopentadiene ring. If the rest of the chain is asymmetric, maybe the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. The carbon at position 2 is connected to the ring, a CH2 (position 1), and a CH2 (position 3). If the chain beyond position 3 is asymmetric, then the carbon at position 2 is connected to three different groups: ring, CH2 (position 1), and CH2 (position 3 with asymmetric chain). If the CH2 (position 3) is part of an asymmetric chain, then the four groups would be: ring, CH2 (position 1), CH2 (asymmetric chain), and hydrogen? Let's see: the carbon at position 2 of the hexane is CH2-CH2-... Wait, no. In a hexane chain, the carbon at position 2 is connected to position 1 (CH2), position 3 (CH2), and the ring. So it's connected to three groups: ring, CH2 (position 1), and CH2 (position 3). If the chain beyond position 3 is asymmetric (because of the methyl at position 5), then the CH2 (position 3) is part of an asymmetric chain. However, the carbon at position 2 is still connected to two CH2 groups (position 1 and 3) and the ring. Unless the ring is considered different from the CH2 groups, but the ring connection is to the cyclopentadiene. This is getting too ambiguous. I think it's not a chiral center.\n\nSo, currently, compounds 1 and 5 are optically active. Let's check if there are others.\n\nWait, compound 7: 8,8-dichlorobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. Maybe there's a chiral center elsewhere. Let's think about the structure. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octane has a bridgehead carbon at position 8 with two chlorines. The other bridgehead is at position 1 (assuming standard numbering). The ketone is at position 7. The carbon at position 7 is the carbonyl carbon. What about the carbon at position 7? No, it's a carbonyl. What about other bridgehead? The carbon at position 1 is connected to two bridges and has no substituents. The carbon at position 8 has two chlorines. The rest of the molecule: are there any chiral centers? For example, the carbon at position 7 is part of the ring. Let me imagine the structure. The bicyclo[4.2.0]octane has a central carbon (bridgehead) connected to two rings. Adding two chlorines at position 8 and a ketone at 7. It's possible that the carbon at position 7 is connected to four different groups? Let me think: the carbon at position 7 is part of the ring and has a carbonyl group. Wait, no, the ketone is at position 7, meaning the carbon is double bonded to oxygen. So it's sp², not a chiral center. What about the carbon at position 6 or 2? Let me think. Without a clear structure, it's hard to say, but I think there's no chiral center here.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a chiral center in compound 1. The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center. Are there any others? The substituent at position 4: prop-1-en-2-yl. The carbon at position 4 of the ring is connected to a CH2=C(R) group. The carbon at position 4 is connected to the ring, the substituent, and a hydrogen. Earlier, I thought it wasn't a chiral center, but let me check again. The carbon at position 4 is part of the ring. It is connected to position 3 and 5 of the ring, the substituent, and a hydrogen. If positions 3 and 5 are different, then it could be a chiral center. Let me consider the ring structure. The ring has a double bond between 1 and 2. Position 4 is opposite to position 1. Position 3 is adjacent to the double bond, position 5 is opposite. In a cyclohexene ring with a substituent at position 4, the positions 3 and 5 might have different environments. For example, position 3 is adjacent to the double bond, while position 5 is not. Therefore, the carbon at position 4 is connected to two different ring carbons (position 3 and 5), the substituent, and a hydrogen. If positions 3 and 5 are different, then the carbon at position 4 has four different groups: position 3, position 5, substituent, and hydrogen. This would make it a chiral center. Let me verify.\n\nIn a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, and a substituent at position 4, the carbon at position 4 is connected to:\n\n- Position 3: which is adjacent to the double bond (position 2).\n\n- Position 5: which is not adjacent to the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the environment of positions 3 and 5 are different. Hence, the carbon at position 4 is connected to two different ring carbons, a substituent, and a hydrogen. This makes it a chiral center. So compound 1 has two chiral centers: one at position 1 and one at position 4. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\nNow, compound 1 has two chiral centers, compound 5 has one. That makes two compounds so far. Are there others?\n\nLet me check compound 4 again. If the carbon at position 4 is a chiral center in compound 1, maybe there are similar cases in other compounds. Let's check compound 5: 3-(2-methylbut-1-en-1-ylidene)cyclohex-1-ene. The substituent is at position 3 of the cyclohexene ring. The carbon at position 3 of the ring is connected to the substituent, positions 2 and 4 of the ring, and a hydrogen. If positions 2 and 4 are different, then it could be a chiral center. Let's see: the ring has a double bond between 1 and 2. Position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (double bond) and position 4. Position 4 is part of the ring. So the carbon at position 3 is connected to position 2 (double bond), position 4 (single bond), the substituent, and a hydrogen. This is similar to compound 1's position 1. If the substituent is different enough, it might be a chiral center. Let me check: the carbon at position 3 is connected to position 2 (double bond), position 4 (single bond), the substituent, and a hydrogen. These four groups are different, making it a chiral center. So compound 5 has two chiral centers: one in the substituent and one at position 3 of the ring. Therefore, it's optically active.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize:\n\nCompound 1: Two chiral centers (position 1 and 4 of the ring).\n\nCompound 5: Two chiral centers (position 3 of the ring and one in the substituent).\n\nBut this would mean more than two compounds are optically active. Let me check if other compounds have similar features.\n\nCompound 4: 5-(5-methylhexan-2-ylidene)cyclopenta-1,3-diene. The ring is cyclopenta-1,3-diene. The substituent is at position 5. The carbon at position 5 of the ring is connected to the substituent, positions 4 and 1 of the ring, and a hydrogen. Let's see: position 5 in a cyclopentadiene ring. The ring has double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. Position 5 is connected to position 4 and 1. Position 4 is part of a double bond (3-4), and position 1 is part of a double bond (1-2). Therefore, the carbon at position 5 is connected to two different ring environments (position 4 with a double bond and position 1 with a double bond?), and the substituent. Wait, in a cyclopenta-1,3-diene, the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4. Position 5 is connected to position 4 (which is part of the 3-4 double bond) and position 1 (which is part of the 1-2 double bond). So the carbon at position 5 is connected to position 4 (double bond), position 1 (double bond), the substituent, and a hydrogen. But positions 4 and 1 are both part of double bonds, but their environments might be different. For example, position 4 is part of the 3-4 double bond, and position 1 is part of the 1-2 double bond. Therefore, the carbon at position 5 is connected to two different double bond positions, making it a chiral center? If the substituent is such that the four groups are different, then yes. The carbon at position 5 is connected to:\n\n- Position 4 (double bond to position 3).\n\n- Position 1 (double bond to position 2).\n\n- Substituent.\n\n- Hydrogen.\n\nSince positions 4 and 1 are different (due to their positions in the ring), this carbon has four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, compound 4 is optically active. This adds another one.\n\nNow, compounds 1, 4, and 5 are optically active. Let me check if others have similar features.\n\nCompound 3: di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane. The methylene group is connected to two cyclohexene rings. The carbon at the methylene is connected to two cyclohexene rings. If the rings are identical, it's symmetrical. But if the rings are in different orientations, maybe it's chiral. However, without chiral centers, it's unlikely. So not optically active.\n\nCompound 7: No.\n\nCompound 6: No.\n\nCompound 8: No.\n\nCompound 2: No.\n\nSo now, three compounds: 1, 4, and 5. Let me check compound 7 again. 8,8-dichlorobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. The carbon at position 8 has two chlorines. What about the carbon at position 7 (the ketone)? No. What about the bridgehead carbon at position 1? It's connected to two bridges and no substituents. Not a chiral center. What about the carbon at position 6 or 2? Let me think. In the bicyclo[4.2.0]octane, the carbon at position 6 is part of the 4-carbon bridge. It might be connected to different groups. Without a clear structure, it's hard to say, but I think it's not chiral.\n\nNow, what about compound 3: di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane. If the two cyclohexene rings are in different orientations, the molecule might be chiral. For example, if the rings are twisted such that there's no plane of symmetry. This is called atropisomerism. However, atropisomerism requires restricted rotation and no plane of symmetry. In this case, the molecule is connected by a methylene group. The rotation around the single bonds might be free, making it not chiral. Unless there's some steric hindrance preventing rotation. But without specific information, it's unlikely to be chiral. So probably not optically active.\n\nSo currently, three compounds: 1, 4, and 5. Let me check if there are others.\n\nCompound 7: 8,8-dichlorobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. Let me think about the structure again. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octane has a bridgehead at position 8 with two chlorines. The other bridgehead is at position 1. The ketone is at position 7. The carbon at position 7 is part of the ring. Let me imagine the structure. The bridgehead at position 8 has two chlorines, making it symmetric. The ketone at position 7 might be on one side of the ring, but if the molecule is symmetric, it's not chiral. However, if the ketone is on a carbon that is not symmetric, it might be chiral. For example, if the carbon at position 7 is connected to different groups. But without a clear structure, it's hard to say. I'll stick with it not being optically active.\n\nNow, let's check compound 1 again: two chiral centers. Compound 4: one chiral center (position 5 of the ring). Compound 5: two chiral centers (position 3 of the ring and one in the substituent). That makes three compounds. Are there others?\n\nWhat about compound 7: 8,8-dichlorobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. Let me think about atropisomerism again. If the molecule has restricted rotation and no plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. However, with two chlorines on the same bridgehead, it might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. I'll assume it's not.\n\nSo total of three optically active compounds: 1, 4, and 5. But the options are A:6, B:5, C:4, D:3. So D:3 is an option. But I need to confirm if there are more.\n\nLet me check compound 4 again: 5-(5-methylhexan-2-ylidene)cyclopenta-1,3-diene. The carbon at position 5 of the ring is a chiral center. What about the carbon at position 5 of the hexane chain? Earlier, I thought it wasn't a chiral center, but let me check again. The carbon at position 5 is CH(CH3). If it's connected to a CH2 (position 4), a CH2 (position 6), and a methyl group, it's not a chiral center. But if the CH2 at position 6 has a different environment, maybe it is. For example, if the chain is asymmetric. However, without more information, I think it's not.\n\nWhat about compound 1: two chiral centers. Compound 4: one. Compound 5: two. Total of five chiral centers across three compounds. But each compound only needs one chiral center to be optically active. So three compounds: 1, 4, 5. But the options include D:3. So maybe the answer is D:3.\n\nBut let me check if there are other compounds with chiral centers.\n\nCompound 7: 8,8-dichlorobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. Let me think of the structure as follows: the bridgehead at position 8 has two chlorines, and the ketone is at position 7. The carbon at position 7 is part of the ring. Let's imagine the carbon at position 7 is connected to a carbonyl group, a ring carbon, and two other ring carbons. If it's a chiral center, it would need four different groups. The carbon at position 7 is connected to:\n\n- A carbonyl group (O).\n\n- Two ring carbons (positions 6 and 8).\n\n- One other ring carbon (position 2?).\n\nWait, without a clear structure, it's hard to say. I'll assume it's not a chiral center.\n\nTherefore, the three compounds are 1, 4, and 5. So the answer is D:3.\n\nBut let me check if I missed any other compounds.\n\nCompound 3: di(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)methane. If the two cyclohexene rings are in different orientations, it might be chiral. For example, if the rings are twisted such that there's no plane of symmetry. This is called atropisomerism. However, for atropisomerism to occur, there needs to be restricted rotation. In this case, the molecule is connected by a methylene group (CH2). The rotation around the C-CH2-C bonds might be free, making it not chiral. Unless there's some steric hindrance. But without specific information, it's unlikely to be chiral. So probably not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
