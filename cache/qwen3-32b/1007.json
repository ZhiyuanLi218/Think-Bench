When exposed to air, it reacts with oxygen. However, under normal room temperature and atmospheric conditions, sodium primarily forms **sodium oxide (Na₂O)**, not sodium peroxide (Na₂O₂). Sodium peroxide is typically formed under more extreme conditions such as with excess oxygen or at higher temperatures.  \n**→ Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n### Option B:\n**\"At room temperature, Al reacts with 4.0 mol·L⁻¹ NaOH solution to produce NaAlO₂.\"**\n\nAluminum is an **amphoteric** metal, meaning it can react with both acids and bases. When it reacts with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it forms **sodium aluminate (NaAlO₂)** along with hydrogen gas. The reaction is as follows:\n\n$$\n2\\text{Al} + 2\\text{NaOH} + 6\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NaAlO}_2 + 3\\text{H}_2 \\uparrow + 4\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\n\nThis reaction is well-documented and occurs at room temperature.  \n**→ Correct.**\n\n---\n\n### Option C:\n**\"At room temperature, Cu reacts with concentrated HNO₃ to release NO gas.\"**\n\nCopper reacts with concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃), but the gas produced is **nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)**, a brown gas, not nitric oxide (NO).

The question is about which statement regarding chemical reactions is correct. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is right.\n\nStarting with option A: At room temperature, sodium (Na) reacts with air to produce Na2O2. Hmm. I remember that sodium is a very reactive metal. When it's exposed to air, it reacts with oxygen. But does it form sodium peroxide (Na2O2) or sodium oxide (Na2O)? I think sodium typically forms Na2O when it reacts with O2 under normal conditions. Peroxides like Na2O2 might form if there's more oxygen or under different conditions, like when heated? Maybe at room temperature, it's more likely to form the oxide. So A might be incorrect.\n\nOption B: At room temperature, aluminum (Al) reacts with 4.0 mol/L NaOH solution to produce NaAlO2. Let me recall. Aluminum is amphoteric, meaning it can react with both acids and bases. When Al reacts with NaOH, it forms sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) and hydrogen gas. The reaction is 2Al + 2NaOH + 6H2O → 2NaAlO2 + 3H2↑ + 4H2O? Wait, the exact stoichiometry might vary, but the main point is that Al does react with NaOH at room temperature, right? I think this is correct. So B could be the correct answer, but I need to check the other options.\n\nOption C: At room temperature, copper (Cu) reacts with concentrated HNO3 to release NO gas. Wait, nitric acid reactions with metals can be tricky. Concentrated nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. When Cu reacts with concentrated HNO3, I remember that it produces NO2 gas, which is a brown gas. The reaction is Cu + 4HNO3 → Cu(NO3)2 + 2NO2 + 2H2O. So NO2 is produced, not NO. However, if it's dilute HNO3, then the reaction produces NO. So option C is incorrect because it's concentrated HNO3, so the gas would be NO2, not NO. So C is wrong.\n\nOption D: At room temperature, Fe reacts with concentrated H2SO4 to produce FeSO4. Hmm. Concentrated sulfuric acid is also a strong oxidizing agent. When iron reacts with concentrated H2SO4, the reaction is different than with dilute H2SO4. With dilute sulfuric acid, iron would produce FeSO4 and hydrogen gas. But with concentrated sulfuric acid, especially at room temperature, sulfuric acid can oxidize iron to Fe3+ compounds. For example, the reaction might produce Fe2(SO4)3 (iron(III) sulfate), along with SO2 gas and water. Also, concentrated sulfuric acid can passivate some metals like iron at room temperature, forming a protective oxide layer. So maybe Fe doesn't react with concentrated H2SO4 at room temperature? Or if it does, it's not producing FeSO4. Therefore, D is incorrect because the product would not be FeSO4 but something else like Fe2(SO4)3 or maybe no reaction due to passivation.\n\nSo going back to the options. A is incorrect because Na forms Na2O, not Na2O2 at room temperature. B seems correct because Al reacts with NaOH to form NaAlO2. C is wrong because concentrated HNO3 gives NO2, not NO. D is incorrect because Fe with concentrated H2SO4 doesn't produce FeSO4. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>"}
