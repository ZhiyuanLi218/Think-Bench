Its most common isotope, **sodium-23**, is **stable** and not radioactive. While some other isotopes of sodium (e.g., sodium-22 or sodium-24) are radioactive and used in nuclear medicine, the element itself is **not naturally radioactive** in its most common form.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Chromium (Cr)**  \nChromium is a **transition metal** with atomic number 24. Its most common isotope, **chromium-52**, is **stable**. Although some **radioisotopes** like chromium-51 are used in medical diagnostics, the element as a whole is **not naturally radioactive**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Americium (Am)**  \nAmericium has an atomic number of **95**, making it a **transuranic element** (elements with atomic numbers greater than 92). It is **not found in nature** and must be **synthesized**, usually in nuclear reactors. Its most well-known isotope, **americium-241**, is **highly radioactive** and is used in **ionization smoke detectors**. Therefore, **Americium is a radioactive element**.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Aluminum (Al)**  \nAluminum is a **light metal** with atomic number 13. The most common isotope, **aluminum-27**, is **stable and non-radioactive**. While there are some **radioactive isotopes**, the element is not considered radioactive in its standard form.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Conclusion:**  \nAmong the given elements, **only Americium (Am)** is a **radioactive element** in its standard and naturally occurring form.\n\n### **Correct Answer: C: Am**","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these elements is radioactive. The options are Sodium (Na), Chromium (Cr), Americium (Am), and Aluminum (Al). Let me start by recalling what I know about each of these.\n\nFirst, Sodium (Na) is an alkali metal, right? I think it's used in things like table salt (sodium chloride). I don't remember it being radioactive. I know some elements in the alkali group have different properties, but sodium is pretty common and not something you'd associate with radioactivity. Maybe it has some isotopes, but the standard Na-23 is stable.\n\nNext, Chromium (Cr) is a transition metal. I remember it's used in stainless steel and for plating. Again, I don't think chromium is naturally radioactive. There are some radioactive isotopes of chromium, like Chromium-51, which is used in medical applications, but the element itself isn't considered radioactive in its standard form. So maybe the question is about the element as a whole, not just specific isotopes?\n\nThen there's Americium (Am). Hmm, that name sounds familiar. I think Americium is one of the transuranic elements, which are elements with atomic numbers higher than uranium (which is 92). Americium has an atomic number of 95. Transuranic elements are typically synthetic and radioactive. I remember that Americium-241 is used in smoke detectors. So that definitely sounds like a radioactive element.\n\nAluminum (Al) is another common metal. It's used in a lot of things like cans, foil, and construction. I don't think aluminum is radioactive. Like sodium, it's a stable element with common isotopes that aren't radioactive. Aluminum-27 is the most common isotope and is stable.\n\nSo, putting this all together: Na, Cr, and Al are stable elements with common non-radioactive isotopes. Americium (Am) is a transuranic element, which means it's not found in nature in significant quantities and is radioactive. Therefore, the answer should be C: Am.\n</think>"}
