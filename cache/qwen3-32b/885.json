Let me start by recalling what I know about capacitors.\n\nFirst, the original setup is a 2 μF capacitor connected to a battery, and when fully charged, it stores 600 μC of charge. The question is asking, if we replace that 2 μF capacitor with three 18 μF capacitors in series, what is the charge on each of them once they are fully charged? The options are given from A to D.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to remember the basic formula for capacitors. The fundamental equation is Q = C * V, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage across the capacitor. So, in the original case, the charge Q is 600 μC, and the capacitance C is 2 μF. If I can find the voltage of the battery, that might be useful for the second part.\n\nSo let me calculate the voltage of the battery first. Using Q = C * V, rearranged as V = Q / C. Plugging in the numbers: V = 600 μC / 2 μF. The micro units cancel out, so that's 600 / 2 = 300 volts. So the battery is 300 volts. Wait, that seems high, but maybe in the context of the problem, it's okay. Let me just keep that in mind.\n\nNow, the second part is replacing the 2 μF capacitor with three 18 μF capacitors in series. So I need to find the equivalent capacitance of three capacitors in series. The formula for capacitors in series is 1/C_eq = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3. Since all three capacitors are the same value, 18 μF each, the formula simplifies to 1/C_eq = 3 / 18 μF. Let me compute that.\n\nSo 3 divided by 18 μF is 1/6 μF. Therefore, taking reciprocal, C_eq = 6 μF? Wait, hold on. Wait, if 1/C_eq = 3 / 18, that's 1/6, so C_eq = 6 μF? Wait, no. Wait, if each capacitor is 18 μF, then 1/C_eq = 1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6. So yes, C_eq is 6 μF? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, because capacitors in series have lower equivalent capacitance than any individual one. Wait, 18 μF is each, so three in series would be 1/(1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18) = 1/(1/6) = 6 μF. Wait, so the equivalent capacitance is 6 μF? Wait, that seems like it's higher than when you have capacitors in parallel, but no, in series the equivalent capacitance is lower. Wait, no, if you have three capacitors in series, the equivalent capacitance should be lower than the smallest individual one. Wait, but here each is 18 μF. So 6 μF is lower than 18 μF. Yes, that makes sense. So 6 μF is correct. So the equivalent capacitance of the three 18 μF capacitors in series is 6 μF.\n\nSo now, since this equivalent capacitance is connected to the same battery, which we found earlier is 300 volts. So the total charge stored in the equivalent capacitance would be Q = C_eq * V. Let me calculate that. Q = 6 μF * 300 V = 1800 μC. But wait, this is the total charge stored in the series combination. However, in a series connection, the charge on each capacitor is the same, right? Because in series, the same current flows through each capacitor, so they all get the same charge. So if the total charge in the equivalent capacitor is 1800 μC, then each individual capacitor in the series has 1800 μC? Wait, but hold on, that seems conflicting with the original problem. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the single capacitor had 600 μC. Now, when replacing with three capacitors in series, which have an equivalent capacitance of 6 μF, and the same battery voltage of 300 V, so Q = 6 * 300 = 1800 μC. But since they are in series, each capacitor has the same charge as the total charge. Therefore, each capacitor has 1800 μC? But that would mean the answer is D: 1800 μC. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, let me cross-verify. Let me think again. If three capacitors are in series, the charge on each is the same. So if the equivalent capacitance is 6 μF, then the total charge stored in the series combination is Q = C_eq * V = 6 μF * 300 V = 1800 μC. Therefore, each capacitor in the series has 1800 μC. That seems right. So each 18 μF capacitor would have 1800 μC of charge. Then, if I wanted to check the voltage across each capacitor, it would be V = Q / C. So for each capacitor, V = 1800 μC / 18 μF = 100 volts. So each capacitor has 100 volts across it. Since there are three capacitors in series, the total voltage would be 3 * 100 = 300 volts, which matches the battery voltage. That seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, the original problem had a 2 μF capacitor storing 600 μC. Let me check that. If the battery is 300 volts, then Q = 2 μF * 300 V = 600 μC. Yes, that's correct. So that checks out.\n\nBut the answer options are A:100 μC B:200 μC C:600 μC D:1800 μC. So according to this reasoning, the answer would be D:1800 μC. But wait, let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but if the equivalent capacitance is 6 μF, then the total charge stored is 6 * 300 = 1800 μC. Since they are in series, each capacitor has the same charge. Therefore, each one has 1800 μC. But each capacitor is 18 μF. So the voltage across each is 1800 μC / 18 μF = 100 V. Then total voltage is 3 * 100 = 300 V. Which is correct. So that seems okay.\n\nBut maybe I confused something here. Let me think again. Let me recall that when capacitors are connected in series, the charge on each capacitor is the same. So if you have three capacitors in series, each one has the same charge. The equivalent capacitance is less than any individual one, but the charge is same on each. So if the equivalent capacitance is C_eq, then Q_total = C_eq * V, and since each capacitor has that same Q_total. Therefore, the answer is 1800 μC. Therefore, option D.\n\nBut wait, the original capacitor had 600 μC. If we have three capacitors in series with higher equivalent capacitance (6 μF vs original 2 μF), then the total charge would be higher, which makes sense because Q = C * V. If C is higher and V is same, then Q is higher. So 6 μF is higher than 2 μF, so Q is 3 times higher (since 6 is 3 times 2), so 3 * 600 μC = 1800 μC. So that also makes sense. Therefore, each capacitor in series has 1800 μC. So the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the question is asking for the charge on each capacitor. Yes. So each capacitor in series has same charge. So answer is D. But let me check again the options. The options are A:100, B:200, C:600, D:1800. So D is 1800. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Let me check the equivalent capacitance again. Three 18 μF capacitors in series. 1/C_eq = 1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6. Therefore, C_eq = 6 μF. Correct. Then Q_total = C_eq * V = 6 * 300 = 1800 μC. And since they are in series, each has 1800 μC. Therefore, answer D. But why is option C 600 μC? Maybe someone might think that the charge remains same? But no, the charge depends on the capacitance and voltage. Since the voltage is same, but capacitance is different, the charge is different. So original was 2 μF, new is 6 μF, so charge is tripled. So 600*3=1800. So answer D. Therefore, I think D is correct. But let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Suppose someone thought that the voltage across each capacitor is same as the battery. If they thought that, then they would compute Q = C * V = 18 μF * 300 V = 5400 μC, which is not among the options. So that's wrong. But since they are in series, the voltage divides. So each capacitor has 100 V, as calculated before. So Q is 18 μF * 100 V = 1800 μC. So that's correct. So answer D. So I think the correct answer is D. But let me check if the problem says \"three 18 μF capacitors in series connected to the same battery\". Yes. So the same battery, so same voltage. Therefore, calculations are correct. Therefore, answer is D. But let me check the options again. The options are A:100, B:200, C:600, D:1800. So D is there. Therefore, the answer is D. But wait, the original problem says \"once the capacitors are fully charged, what charge is stored on each capacitor?\" So each of the three capacitors has 1800 μC. Therefore, answer D. So I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Wait, in the original case, the capacitor is connected directly to the battery. So when you replace it with three capacitors in series, connected directly to the same battery. So the battery's voltage is same. So yes, calculations are correct. Therefore, answer D. But why is option C there? Because maybe someone might think that since the original capacitor had 600 μC, the new ones also have same charge? But that would be incorrect. Because when you change the capacitance, the charge changes. The charge depends on both capacitance and voltage. Since the voltage is same, but capacitance is different, the charge is different. So answer D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating equivalent capacitance? Let me check again. Three capacitors in series, each 18 μF. So 1/C_eq = 1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6. Therefore, C_eq = 6 μF. Correct. Then Q = 6 μF * 300 V = 1800 μC. Correct. Each capacitor in series has same charge, so 1800 μC. Therefore, answer D. Therefore, I think the correct answer is D. But let me check once again for any possible mistake.\n\nAnother way: Let's calculate the charge on each capacitor step by step. Since they are in series, charge is same on all. Let me call that Q. The voltage across each capacitor is V1 = Q / C, V2 = Q / C, V3 = Q / C. Since they are same capacitors, same Q, same capacitance, same voltage. Total voltage is V_total = 3 * Q / C. But V_total is the battery voltage, which is 300 V. Therefore, 3 * Q / 18 μF = 300 V. Let me solve for Q. So:\n\n3Q / 18 μF = 300 V  \nQ / 6 μF = 300 V  \nQ = 300 V * 6 μF  \nQ = 1800 μC\n\nYes! Exactly. Therefore, this method also gives Q = 1800 μC. So that's the charge on each capacitor. Therefore, answer D. So definitely, D is correct. Therefore, I think the answer is D:1800 μC.\n\nBut let me check if I messed up the equivalent capacitance. Suppose someone thought that capacitors in series add like resistors in parallel, but no, capacitors in series add reciprocally. So 1/C_eq = sum 1/Ci. So yes, correct. So three 18s in series gives 6 μF. So correct. So all steps are correct. Therefore, answer D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
