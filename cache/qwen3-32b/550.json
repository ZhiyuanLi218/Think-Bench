So, the question is about comparing the brightness variation caused by star spots to that of a hypothetical exoplanet transiting the star. The goal is to find the ratio of the exoplanet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the setup. The star has the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature (Teff) of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler or hotter? Wait, the problem says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. I need to clarify whether they are cooler or hotter. Since they are dark spots, I think they are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the spot temperature would be Teff_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K. But maybe I should check if that's the case. Dark spots are usually cooler, so that's probably right.\n\nNow, the star's brightness varies because as it rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes in and out of view, causing periodic dimming. The question is, if instead of spots, there was a transiting exoplanet, what radius would that planet need to have so that the depth of the transit (the dip in brightness) is the same as the variation caused by the spots. The answer choices are given, so I need to calculate the correct ratio.\n\nLet me recall how transit depth works. The depth of a transit is given by (Rpl/Rstar)^2, assuming the planet is much smaller than the star and the star is a perfect blackbody. However, in reality, the star isn't a perfect blackbody, and the spots complicate things because they have different temperatures. But maybe for this problem, we can approximate the brightness variation caused by the spots as a certain amount of blocked light, and compare that to the blocked light from a planet.\n\nWait, but the spots are not blocking light; they are emitting less light because they are cooler. So when the spots are in view, the total light from the star is less than when they are not. So the variation in brightness is due to the difference between the light emitted by the spotted hemisphere and the light that would be emitted if that hemisphere were unspotted.\n\nSo let's model this. The star has radius R (same as the Sun). One hemisphere is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (πR²) since a hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere. Wait, no, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere would be 2πR². The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².\n\nBut maybe I need to think in terms of the total luminosity of the star. The total luminosity L is the integral of the flux over the entire surface. Let's assume that the star's luminosity is dominated by the photosphere, except for the spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total luminosity is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The variation in luminosity would be the difference between the luminosity when the spots are in view and when they are not.\n\nWait, but since the star is rotating, when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the total emitted light is less than when the unspotted hemisphere is in view. So the brightness variation is due to this difference.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's denote:\n\n- A = total surface area of the star = 4πR²\n\n- A_spot = area of spots = filling factor * hemisphere area = 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR²\n\n- A_unspot = area of unspotted regions on the hemisphere. Wait, but the entire hemisphere is 2πR². If 20% is covered by spots, then 80% is unspotted. So the unspotted area on the hemisphere is 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6πR². However, the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted, so its area is 2πR². So total unspotted area when the spotted hemisphere is in view is 1.6πR² (from the spotted hemisphere) + 2πR² (from the other hemisphere) = 3.6πR². When the spotted hemisphere is not in view (i.e., the other hemisphere is facing us), the total unspotted area is 2πR² (from the unspotted hemisphere) + 2πR² (from the other hemisphere's unspotted area?) Wait, no. Wait, the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted? Wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the other hemisphere is unspotted. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then rotates out. So the total area of the spots is 0.4πR² as calculated before.\n\nSo when the spots are in view, the total luminosity is the luminosity from the spots plus the luminosity from the rest of the star. When the spots are not in view, the total luminosity is just the luminosity from the entire star's surface (all unspotted).\n\nWait, but the rest of the star's surface is unspotted. So when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the spots are on that hemisphere, and the other hemisphere is unspotted. So the total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is in view is:\n\nL_spot = (A_spot * σ * T_spot^4) + (A_unspot_in_spotted_hemisphere * σ * T_eff^4) + (A_other_hemisphere * σ * T_eff^4)\n\nWhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nBut A_unspot_in_spotted_hemisphere is the area of the spotted hemisphere minus the spots, so that's 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR². The other hemisphere is 2πR² and unspotted.\n\nSo L_spot = [0.4πR² * σ * T_spot^4 + 1.6πR² * σ * T_eff^4 + 2πR² * σ * T_eff^4]\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL_spot = σ * πR² [0.4 T_spot^4 + 1.6 T_eff^4 + 2 T_eff^4] = σ * πR² [0.4 T_spot^4 + 3.6 T_eff^4]\n\nWhen the spots are not in view (i.e., the other hemisphere is facing us), the total luminosity is:\n\nL_unspot = σ * πR² [ (2πR² + 2πR²) * σ * T_eff^4 ]? Wait, no. Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is not in view, the entire star is unspotted. Wait, no. The star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is not in view, the entire star's surface is unspotted? No, only the other hemisphere is in view, but the entire star's surface is still the same. Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently.\n\nActually, the total luminosity of the star is constant. Wait, no. Wait, the star is rotating, so the total emitted light depends on which parts are visible. Wait, but the star is a sphere, and we're observing it from a fixed direction. As it rotates, the amount of spotted area in view changes. But the total luminosity of the star is fixed. Wait, no, the total luminosity is fixed, but the observed flux (which is what the photometric time series measures) depends on the projected area and the temperature distribution. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the brightness variation as the difference in flux when the spots are in view versus when they are not. Since the star is rotating, the total flux we receive varies depending on the visible hemisphere.\n\nLet me consider the flux received from the star. The flux from a star is proportional to the surface brightness (which is σ T^4) times the projected area. However, for a spherical star, the total luminosity is 4πR² * σ T^4, but when considering the observed flux from a distance, it's L / (4πd²), where d is the distance. However, here we are considering the photometric variations due to spots, so we need to think about how the observed flux changes as the star rotates.\n\nBut maybe a simpler approach is to calculate the ratio of the observed flux when the spots are in view versus when they are not. The amplitude of the variation is the difference between these two fluxes.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nWhen the spotted hemisphere is in view (i.e., the spots are visible), the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spots and the flux from the rest of the star (which is unspotted). When the spotted hemisphere is not in view, the entire star is unspotted, so the flux is higher.\n\nLet me define F_unspot as the flux when the entire star is unspotted. F_spot is the flux when the spotted hemisphere is in view. The variation in brightness is F_unspot - F_spot.\n\nBut how to calculate F_unspot and F_spot?\n\nFirst, F_unspot is the flux from the entire star if there were no spots. So the entire surface is at Teff = 6000 K. The total flux from the star is L = 4πR² σ T_eff^4. The observed flux (F_unspot) is L / (4πd²), but since we are comparing relative changes (the amplitude of the light curve), the distance cancels out. So we can just consider the ratio of fluxes.\n\nAlternatively, since we are interested in the relative change in brightness, we can model the flux as proportional to the effective temperature and area.\n\nBut when the spots are present, the total flux is less because the spots are cooler. Let's think in terms of the total flux.\n\nTotal flux when the star has spots: F_spot = (A_spot * σ T_spot^4 + A_unspot * σ T_eff^4) / (4πd²)\n\nWhere A_spot is the area of the spots, and A_unspot is the area of the unspotted regions.\n\nBut A_spot + A_unspot = total surface area of the star, which is 4πR². However, only one hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots are only on one hemisphere. Therefore, the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². The rest of the star's surface is unspotted. So A_unspot = total surface area - A_spot = 4πR² - 0.4πR² = 3.6πR².\n\nWait, but when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the total flux is from the spots plus the unspotted regions. When it's not in view, the entire star is unspotted? No, the spots are always there; they are just on one hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is in view, we see the spots; when it's on the far side, we don't. So the total flux when the spots are in view is less than when they are not. Therefore, the total flux when spots are in view is:\n\nF_spot = [A_spot * σ T_spot^4 + (A_total - A_spot) * σ T_eff^4] / (4πd²)\n\nAnd when the spots are not in view (i.e., the other hemisphere is facing us), the total flux is:\n\nF_unspot = [A_total * σ T_eff^4] / (4πd²)\n\nWait, no. Wait, when the spots are not in view, the entire star is still there, but the spots are on the far side. However, the total flux is still the same as if the entire star were unspotted? No, because the spots are still emitting light from the far side. Wait, no. The spots are part of the star's surface; their emission is always present. The only difference is whether we can see them. So the total luminosity of the star is always the same, regardless of the observer's view. However, the observed flux depends on the visible hemisphere. Wait, that seems contradictory. How can the observed flux vary if the total luminosity is constant?\n\nAh, right! The total luminosity (L) is the integral of the flux over all solid angles. The observed flux (F) depends on the angle and the distribution of temperatures. However, if the star is spherically symmetric, the total luminosity is 4π times the flux at the surface. But when there are spots, the total luminosity is still the integral over the entire surface. However, the observed flux from a distant observer depends on the visible hemisphere. Wait, no. The total luminosity is the same, but the observed flux (which is what the photometric time series measures) is the flux received per unit area at the observer's location. That would depend on the orientation of the star.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to think in terms of the flux emitted by the visible hemisphere. When the star is observed, the visible hemisphere is the one facing the observer. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the flux received is the sum of the flux from the spots and the unspotted parts of that hemisphere, plus the flux from the other hemisphere (which is unspotted). Wait, no. Actually, when you look at a star, you see the entire hemisphere that's facing you. The other hemisphere is not visible. So the total flux received is the integral over the visible hemisphere.\n\nTherefore, when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the visible hemisphere has spots covering 20% of it. The flux from that visible hemisphere is 0.2 * (flux from spots) + 0.8 * (flux from unspotted regions). The other hemisphere is not visible, so its flux doesn't contribute. When the star rotates, the other hemisphere (which is unspotted) comes into view, so the flux is from the entire unspotted hemisphere.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the total observed flux is the flux from the visible hemisphere. Since the star is rotating, the visible hemisphere alternates between the spotted one and the unspotted one. Therefore, the flux alternates between two values: one when the spotted hemisphere is visible, and one when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.\n\nTherefore, the variation in flux is due to the difference between the flux from the spotted hemisphere and the flux from the unspotted hemisphere.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- When the unspotted hemisphere is visible: F_unspot = (area of hemisphere) * σ T_eff^4\n\n- When the spotted hemisphere is visible: F_spot = (area of spots on hemisphere * σ T_spot^4) + (area of unspotted parts on hemisphere * σ T_eff^4)\n\nThe area of the hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². The unspotted part of the hemisphere is 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6πR².\n\nTherefore:\n\nF_unspot = 2πR² * σ T_eff^4\n\nF_spot = 0.4πR² * σ T_spot^4 + 1.6πR² * σ T_eff^4\n\nThe variation in flux ΔF is F_unspot - F_spot.\n\nΔF = 2πR² σ T_eff^4 - [0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 + 1.6πR² σ T_eff^4]\n\nSimplify:\n\nΔF = πR² σ [2 T_eff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 - 1.6 T_eff^4]\n\n= πR² σ [ (2 - 1.6) T_eff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ]\n\n= πR² σ [0.4 T_eff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4]\n\n= 0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)\n\nSo the amplitude of the variation in flux is ΔF = 0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)\n\nNow, we need to compare this to the transit depth caused by a planet. The transit depth is the ratio of the flux blocked by the planet to the flux from the star when it's unspotted.\n\nThe flux blocked by the planet is the area of the planet times the flux per unit area at the star's surface. Wait, but in transit, the planet blocks a circular area on the star, so the blocked flux is π Rpl² * σ T_eff^4 (assuming the planet doesn't emit any light, which is a good approximation).\n\nBut the transit depth is the ratio of the blocked flux to the total flux from the star. Wait, but the total flux from the star is L = 4πR² σ T_eff^4. However, the observed flux is F = L / (4πd²), where d is the distance. But again, since we are looking for the ratio (transit depth), the distance cancels out.\n\nAlternatively, the transit depth ΔF_transit / F_unspot is equal to (π Rpl² σ T_eff^4) / (2πR² σ T_eff^4) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the transit depth is the ratio of the decrease in flux to the flux when the planet isn't transiting. The decrease in flux is the flux blocked by the planet. The flux from the star when there's no transit is F_unspot = 2πR² σ T_eff^4 (as we defined earlier, since we're looking at the hemisphere). Wait, no! Wait, earlier I was considering the flux from the visible hemisphere. But in reality, when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk, so the flux decrease is proportional to the area ratio (Rpl/Rstar)^2. However, in the case of the spots, the flux variation is due to the difference in the visible hemisphere's flux.\n\nBut perhaps I need to reconcile these two scenarios. Let me think again.\n\nThe transit depth is usually given by (Rpl/Rstar)^2, assuming the planet blocks a circular area on the star and the star is a flat disk emitting uniformly. However, in reality, stars have limb darkening, but for simplicity, we often ignore it and just use the area ratio.\n\nIn our case, the spot-induced variation is ΔF / F_unspot. Let's compute that.\n\nΔF / F_unspot = [0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [2 πR² σ T_eff^4] = [0.4 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [2 T_eff^4] = 0.2 * [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nSo this is the fractional decrease in flux when the spots are in view compared to when the unspotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nFor the planet transit, the fractional decrease in flux is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.\n\nWe want these two to be equal. Therefore:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2 * [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nGiven that T_eff = 6000 K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. Assuming the spots are cooler, T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.\n\nLet me compute T_spot^4 / T_eff^4.\n\nFirst, compute T_eff^4 and T_spot^4.\n\nBut since we are dealing with ratios, let's compute (T_spot / T_eff)^4.\n\nT_spot / T_eff = 5000 / 6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333\n\n(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.4823\n\nSo 1 - 0.4823 ≈ 0.5177\n\nMultiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035\n\nSo (Rpl/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.1035\n\nTherefore, Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3216\n\nSo approximately 0.32, which is option A: ~0.32.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the variation in flux ΔF is calculated as the difference between F_unspot (flux from unspotted hemisphere) and F_spot (flux from spotted hemisphere). Then, the ratio ΔF / F_unspot is the fractional decrease in brightness when the spots are in view. This is set equal to the transit depth (Rpl/Rstar)^2.\n\nLet me re-derive the ΔF / F_unspot:\n\nΔF / F_unspot = [F_unspot - F_spot]/F_unspot = 1 - F_spot/F_unspot.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nF_spot = 0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 + 1.6πR² σ T_eff^4\n\nF_unspot = 2πR² σ T_eff^4\n\nSo F_spot / F_unspot = [0.4 T_spot^4 + 1.6 T_eff^4] / [2 T_eff^4] = 0.2 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) + 0.8\n\nTherefore, ΔF / F_unspot = 1 - [0.2 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) + 0.8] = 0.2 - 0.2 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)], which matches what I had before.\n\nSo yes, that part is correct.\n\nThen, with T_spot = 5000 K, T_eff = 6000 K, compute (T_spot / T_eff)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823, so 1 - 0.4823 ≈ 0.5177. Multiply by 0.2 gives ~0.1035. Square root of that is ~0.3216, so approximately 0.32, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the answer choices are A: ~0.32, B: ~0.07, C: ~0.11, D: ~0.39.\n\nSo according to this calculation, the answer is A. However, let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation of the flux ratio.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that the spot causes a decrease in the flux from the visible hemisphere. The planet causes a decrease in the total flux from the star. Wait, but in my calculation, I compared the spot-induced flux decrease to the flux from the visible hemisphere. But when a planet transits, it blocks a portion of the entire star, not just the visible hemisphere. However, in reality, the total flux from the star is the integral over the entire surface. So maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nHold on, this might be a critical error. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen considering the spot effect, we are looking at the flux from the visible hemisphere. The total flux from the star is actually double that (since there are two hemispheres), but when we observe the star, we only see one hemisphere at a time. However, the total luminosity of the star is 4πR² σ T_eff^4 (assuming the other hemisphere is also at T_eff). But when there are spots on one hemisphere, the total luminosity is different. Wait, no. The problem states that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K. The effective temperature is defined such that the total luminosity is L = 4πR² σ T_eff^4. Therefore, the presence of spots does not change the total luminosity, but redistributes the temperature across the surface. Wait, but if the spots are cooler, then the total luminosity would be less. However, the problem says the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, which implies that the total luminosity is as if the entire star were at 6000 K. Therefore, the spots must be balanced by hotter regions? Or maybe the effective temperature already accounts for the spots. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K\". The effective temperature is defined by the total luminosity: L = 4πR² σ Teff^4. If the star has spots, which are cooler, then the total luminosity would be less than if the entire star were at Teff. However, the problem states that the star has Teff of 6000K, so that must mean that the total luminosity is indeed 4πR² σ Teff^4, which would require that the spots are balanced by other regions that are hotter. But the problem says that only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So perhaps this is a contradiction? Or maybe the problem assumes that the effective temperature is still 6000 K despite the spots, meaning that the total luminosity is maintained by other factors, such as the rest of the star being hotter? But the problem doesn't mention that. This is a bit of a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-express the total luminosity considering the spots. If the star has one hemisphere with spots and the other hemisphere unspotted, then the total luminosity would be:\n\nL_total = [A_spot * σ T_spot^4 + (A_total - A_spot) * σ T_eff^4]\n\nBut since the effective temperature is defined by L_total = 4πR² σ Teff^4, this would mean that Teff is not the same as the temperature of the unspotted regions. However, the problem states that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So perhaps the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K, and the total luminosity is calculated accordingly, giving the effective temperature as 6000 K? Wait, that can't be, because if half the star is cooler and the other half is at 6000 K, the effective temperature would be different.\n\nLet me compute the effective temperature in that case. Suppose half the star is at T_spot and half at T_eff_unspot. Wait, but the problem says the spots are on one hemisphere. So if the entire star's surface is not uniform, the effective temperature is derived from the total luminosity.\n\nLet me calculate the total luminosity if one hemisphere is at T_spot and the other at T_eff_unspot.\n\nBut the problem says the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, so L_total = 4πR² σ (6000)^4.\n\nBut if one hemisphere is at T_spot and the other at T_eff_unspot, then:\n\nL_total = 2πR² σ T_spot^4 + 2πR² σ T_eff_unspot^4 = 2πR² σ (T_spot^4 + T_eff_unspot^4)\n\nSetting this equal to 4πR² σ (6000)^4:\n\n2 (T_spot^4 + T_eff_unspot^4) = 4 (6000)^4\n\n=> T_spot^4 + T_eff_unspot^4 = 2 (6000)^4\n\nBut the problem states that the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. If the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, then T_spot would be 5000 K. Let's check:\n\n(5000)^4 + (6000)^4 = ?\n\n(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823, so 5000^4 ≈ 0.4823 * 6000^4\n\nThen total would be 0.4823 * 6000^4 + 6000^4 = 1.4823 * 6000^4, which is less than 2 * 6000^4. Therefore, this would mean that the effective temperature would be lower than 6000 K. But the problem says the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, which implies that the total luminosity is as if the entire star were at 6000 K. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my assumption.\n\nThis suggests that the unspotted regions are not at 6000 K. Instead, the spots are at T_spot, and the rest of the star is at a higher temperature such that the total luminosity is maintained. However, the problem states that the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. It doesn't specify whether they are hotter or colder, but since they are dark spots, they are likely colder. However, if the rest of the star is hotter to compensate, then the effective temperature remains 6000 K.\n\nBut the problem says \"the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K.\" This wording suggests that the effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are either 1000 K hotter or colder. But without additional information, we have to assume that the rest of the star is at the effective temperature. However, as shown earlier, this leads to a contradiction because the total luminosity would not match the effective temperature. Therefore, there must be an implicit assumption here.\n\nPerhaps the problem is simplifying things and assuming that the effective temperature is still 6000 K despite the spots, meaning that the total luminosity is maintained by other means, and the spots are just cooler regions on the star's surface. In that case, the total luminosity is 4πR² σ (6000)^4, and the spots are at 5000 K, while the rest of the star is at a higher temperature. But since the problem doesn't mention this, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nHowever, given that the problem provides the effective temperature as 6000 K and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K, and asks for the comparison to a planet's transit depth, I think we have to proceed with the initial calculation where we assumed the unspotted regions are at 6000 K. Even though this leads to a total luminosity that would imply a lower effective temperature, the problem seems to want us to ignore that and proceed with the given numbers. Perhaps in this hypothetical scenario, the effective temperature is still 6000 K despite the spots, and the calculation proceeds as before.\n\nTherefore, going back to the previous calculation where we found Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.32, which is option A. However, let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the spot causes a certain amount of flux deficit compared to the unspotted hemisphere. The planet would need to block the same amount of flux.\n\nThe flux deficit due to the spots is ΔF = 0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4), as calculated before. The total flux from the star when it's unspotted is F_total = 4πR² σ T_eff^4. But wait, when we're observing the star, we see only one hemisphere at a time, so the observed flux is F_obs = 2πR² σ T_eff^4. The transit depth is ΔF_transit / F_obs = (π Rpl² σ T_eff^4) / (2πR² σ T_eff^4) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2. Wait, no. Wait, the flux blocked by the planet is π Rpl² σ T_eff^4 (assuming the planet is in front of a region at T_eff). The observed flux without the planet is F_obs = 2πR² σ T_eff^4. Therefore, the transit depth is (π Rpl² σ T_eff^4) / (2πR² σ T_eff^4) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2.\n\nBut earlier, we had ΔF / F_obs = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]. Setting these equal:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2 = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nTherefore, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.4 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nWait, this is different from what I had before. Previously, I didn't divide by 2. Where is this discrepancy coming from?\n\nEarlier, I had ΔF / F_unspot = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)], where F_unspot is 2πR² σ T_eff^4. But if the transit depth is ΔF_transit / F_total, where F_total is 4πR² σ T_eff^4, then it would be different. But the problem is about photometric time-series observations, which measure the observed flux from the star, which is the flux from the visible hemisphere. So when comparing to a transit, we need to ensure we're comparing the same observed flux.\n\nIn the case of the spot, the observed flux varies between F_unspot = 2πR² σ T_eff^4 and F_spot = 2πR² σ [0.2 T_spot^4 + 0.8 T_eff^4]. The variation in flux is ΔF = F_unspot - F_spot = 2πR² σ T_eff^4 - 2πR² σ [0.2 T_spot^4 + 0.8 T_eff^4] = 2πR² σ [T_eff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4 - 0.8 T_eff^4] = 2πR² σ [0.2 T_eff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4] = 0.4 πR² σ [T_eff^4 - T_spot^4]. Wait, no, 2πR² σ [0.2(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] = 0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4). So ΔF is 0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).\n\nThe transit depth is the ratio of the blocked flux to the observed flux. If the planet transits, it blocks a flux of π Rpl² σ T_eff^4. The observed flux is F_obs = 2πR² σ T_eff^4. So the transit depth is (π Rpl² σ T_eff^4) / (2πR² σ T_eff^4) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2.\n\nSetting this equal to ΔF / F_obs:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2 = [0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [2πR² σ T_eff^4] = 0.4 [T_eff^4 - T_spot^4] / (2 T_eff^4) = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nTherefore:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.4 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nAh, so previously I had 0.2 [1 - ...], but now it's 0.4 [1 - ...]. This is because I forgot to divide by 2 in the transit depth. So this changes the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate with this correction.\n\nGiven T_spot = 5000 K, T_eff = 6000 K.\n\n(T_spot / T_eff)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823\n\nSo 1 - 0.4823 ≈ 0.5177\n\nMultiply by 0.4: 0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.2071\n\nThen Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455\n\nWait, but this is not one of the answer choices. The options are ~0.32, ~0.07, ~0.11, ~0.39. 0.455 is close to 0.45, which isn't listed. Hmm, this suggests an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, where did the factor of 0.4 come from? Let's retrace.\n\nThe variation in flux ΔF is 0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).\n\nThe transit depth is ΔF_transit / F_obs = (π Rpl² σ T_eff^4) / (2πR² σ T_eff^4) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2.\n\nSetting ΔF / F_obs = ΔF_transit / F_obs:\n\n0.4 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / (2 T_eff^4) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2\n\nWait, no, ΔF / F_obs is [0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [2πR² σ T_eff^4] = 0.4 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / (2 T_eff^4) = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nSetting this equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2 = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nTherefore:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.4 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nYes, that's correct. So with the numbers:\n\n0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.2071, so Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455, which is approximately 0.46. But none of the answer choices are close to this. The closest is D: ~0.39. This suggests that there is a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me go back to the calculation of ΔF. Earlier, I said ΔF = 0.4 πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4). Let me recheck this.\n\nThe flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spot = 0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 + 1.6πR² σ T_eff^4.\n\nThe flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F_unspot = 2πR² σ T_eff^4.\n\nΔF = F_unspot - F_spot = 2πR² σ T_eff^4 - (0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 + 1.6πR² σ T_eff^4) = 2πR² σ T_eff^4 - 1.6πR² σ T_eff^4 - 0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 = 0.4πR² σ T_eff^4 - 0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 = 0.4πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo ΔF / F_obs = [0.4πR² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [2πR² σ T_eff^4] = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)].\n\nAnd the transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2.\n\nSetting equal:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2 = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\n=> (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.4 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)].\n\nWith the numbers, this gives:\n\n0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.207, so sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.455. But this isn't one of the options. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps the transit depth is not (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2, but (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Let me think. If the star were a flat disk emitting uniformly, then the transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. But in reality, we are comparing to the flux from the visible hemisphere, which is half the total flux. If the planet transits the entire star, the depth would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2, but if we're comparing to the flux from the visible hemisphere, perhaps it's different.\n\nWait, no. The transit depth is the ratio of the blocked flux to the total flux from the star. If the star's total flux is L = 4πR² σ T_eff^4, and the observed flux is F_obs = L / 2 (since we see half the star), then blocking a fraction (Rpl/Rstar)^2 of the total flux would result in a depth of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * (L / 2) / (L / 2) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Wait, no. If the planet blocks a fraction f of the total flux, then the depth is f. But if the observed flux is half the total flux, and the planet blocks f * total flux, then the depth is (f * total flux) / (observed flux) = f * (total flux) / (total flux / 2) = 2f.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Total flux from the star: F_total = 4πR² σ T_eff^4\n\n- Observed flux: F_obs = F_total / 2 = 2πR² σ T_eff^4 (since we see half the star)\n\n- When the planet transits, it blocks a flux of F_blocked = π Rpl² σ T_eff^4 (assuming it blocks a region at T_eff)\n\n- The transit depth is F_blocked / F_obs = (π Rpl² σ T_eff^4) / (2πR² σ T_eff^4) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2\n\nYes, that's correct. So the transit depth is half of (Rpl/Rstar)^2. But the spot-induced variation is ΔF / F_obs = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)].\n\nSetting these equal:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2 = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\n=> (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.4 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)]\n\nWith the numbers, this gives (Rpl/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.207, so Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.455. But this is not one of the options. This suggests that either my calculation is wrong, or there's a different approach.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. Let's assume that the total luminosity of the star is unchanged by the spots, and that the effective temperature is still 6000 K. In this case, the presence of cooler spots must be balanced by hotter regions elsewhere. However, the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. This seems conflicting, but let's proceed.\n\nIf the total luminosity is L = 4πR² σ Teff^4, and one hemisphere is at T_spot, and the other hemisphere is at T_unspot, then:\n\nL = 2πR² σ T_spot^4 + 2πR² σ T_unspot^4 = 4πR² σ Teff^4\n\n=> T_spot^4 + T_unspot^4 = 2 Teff^4\n\nGiven that the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K, let's assume T_spot = Teff - 1000 = 5000 K, and solve for T_unspot.\n\n(5000)^4 + T_unspot^4 = 2*(6000)^4\n\nCompute T_unspot^4 = 2*(6000)^4 - (5000)^4\n\nLet me calculate this numerically.\n\nFirst, compute (6000)^4 = (6^4)*(1000)^4 = 1296 * 10^12 = 1.296 * 10^15\n\nWait, more accurately, 6000^4 = (6*10^3)^4 = 6^4 * 10^12 = 1296 * 10^12 = 1.296e+15 K^4\n\nSimilarly, 5000^4 = (5*10^3)^4 = 625 * 10^12 = 6.25e+14 K^4\n\nSo T_unspot^4 = 2*1.296e+15 - 6.25e+14 = 2.592e+15 - 6.25e+14 = 1.967e+15 K^4\n\nTherefore, T_unspot = (1.967e+15)^(1/4) K\n\nLet me compute this. First, note that (1.967e+15) = 1.967 * 10^15.\n\nWe can write this as (1.967)^{1/4} * (10^15)^{1/4} = (1.967)^{1/4} * 10^{3.75}\n\nWait, 10^15^(1/4) = 10^(15/4) = 10^3.75 ≈ 10^3 * 10^0.75 ≈ 1000 * 5.623 ≈ 5623 K\n\nNow, (1.967)^{1/4} ≈ let's calculate. 1.967^0.25. Since 1.967 is approximately 2, and 2^0.25 ≈ 1.189. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nLet me take the natural logarithm: ln(1.967) ≈ 0.676. Divide by 4: 0.169. Exponentiate: e^0.169 ≈ 1.184. So T_unspot ≈ 1.184 * 5623 K ≈ 6650 K.\n\nSo the unspotted hemisphere is at ~6650 K.\n\nNow, let's recalculate the flux from the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted hemisphere.\n\nWhen the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is from the spots (20% of the hemisphere at 5000 K) and the unspotted part of the hemisphere (80% at 6650 K). Wait, no! If the total luminosity is maintained by having the other hemisphere at 6650 K, then when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is from the spotted hemisphere (20% at 5000 K, 80% at 6650 K), and the other hemisphere is not visible, so its flux isn't counted. When the unspotted hemisphere is in view, it's at 6650 K, so the flux is from that entire hemisphere at 6650 K.\n\nLet me compute F_spot and F_unspot in this scenario.\n\nF_spot = 0.2 * 2πR² σ (5000)^4 + 0.8 * 2πR² σ (6650)^4\n\nWait, no. The spotted hemisphere has 20% spots at 5000 K and 80% at 6650 K? No, no. Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. This means 20% of that hemisphere's area is spots, and the remaining 80% is unspotted. But in this case, the unspotted parts of the hemisphere are still at the same temperature as the rest of the star? No, because the other hemisphere is at 6650 K to maintain the total luminosity. Wait, this is getting too complex, but let's proceed.\n\nActually, the spots are on one hemisphere, and the rest of the star (both hemispheres?) No, only one hemisphere is spotty. The other hemisphere is unspotted. Wait, no. The problem says \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". So the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted. But to maintain the total luminosity, the entire star must have a combination of temperatures. If one hemisphere has spots and the other is unspotted, but the total luminosity is maintained by having the unspotted hemisphere at a higher temperature.\n\nSo, the spotted hemisphere has 20% spots at 5000 K and 80% at T_unspot? No, the other hemisphere is unspotted, but what temperature is it at? Earlier, we calculated that to maintain the total luminosity, if one hemisphere is at 5000 K and the other is at T_unspot, then T_unspot ≈ 6650 K.\n\nSo when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is from that hemisphere (20% at 5000 K, 80% at 5000 K? No, wait. No, the other 80% of the spotted hemisphere is unspotted, but what temperature is it? If the other hemisphere is at 6650 K, does that mean the unspotted parts of the spotted hemisphere are also at 6650 K? Or is the entire star, except for the spots, at some temperature?\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe total luminosity is L = 4πR² σ (6000)^4.\n\nIf one hemisphere is partially covered in spots, and the other hemisphere is unspotted, then:\n\nL = [area of spots * σ T_spot^4 + area of unspotted on spotted hemisphere * σ T_unspot1^4 + area of unspotted hemisphere * σ T_unspot2^4]\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Let's assume that the entire star, except for the spots, is at a uniform temperature T_unspot. This would mean that the spots are at T_spot, and the rest of the star is at T_unspot, such that the total luminosity is L = 4πR² σ (6000)^4.\n\nGiven that one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20% in spots, the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR², and the rest of the star is 3.6πR² at T_unspot.\n\nSo:\n\nL = 0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 + 3.6πR² σ T_unspot^4 = 4πR² σ (6000)^4\n\nDivide both sides by πR² σ:\n\n0.4 T_spot^4 + 3.6 T_unspot^4 = 4 (6000)^4\n\nGiven T_spot = 5000 K, solve for T_unspot.\n\n0.4*(5000)^4 + 3.6*T_unspot^4 = 4*(6000)^4\n\nLet me compute the numerical values.\n\nFirst, (5000)^4 = 625 * 10^12 = 6.25e+14\n\n(6000)^4 = 1.296e+15\n\nSo:\n\n0.4 * 6.25e+14 + 3.6 * T_unspot^4 = 4 * 1.296e+15\n\n0.4 * 6.25e+14 = 2.5e+14\n\n4 * 1.296e+15 = 5.184e+15\n\nSo:\n\n3.6 * T_unspot^4 = 5.184e+15 - 2.5e+14 = 5.184e+15 - 0.25e+15 = 4.934e+15\n\nT_unspot^4 = 4.934e+15 / 3.6 ≈ 1.3706e+15\n\nT_unspot ≈ (1.3706e+15)^(1/4) K\n\nAgain, let's compute this. \n\n1.3706e+15 = 1.3706 * 10^15\n\nTake the fourth root: (1.3706)^(1/4) * (10^15)^(1/4) ≈ 1.084 * 10^3.75 ≈ 1.084 * 5623 ≈ 6080 K\n\nSo T_unspot ≈ 6080 K.\n\nNow, when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux from that hemisphere is:\n\nF_spot = 0.2 * 2πR² σ T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2πR² σ T_unspot^4 = 0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 + 1.6πR² σ T_unspot^4\n\nWhen the unspotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is:\n\nF_unspot = 2πR² σ T_unspot^4\n\nThe variation in flux ΔF = F_unspot - F_spot = 2πR² σ T_unspot^4 - (0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 + 1.6πR² σ T_unspot^4) = (2 - 1.6)πR² σ T_unspot^4 - 0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 = 0.4πR² σ (T_unspot^4 - T_spot^4)\n\nThe observed flux when the unspotted hemisphere is in view is F_unspot = 2πR² σ T_unspot^4\n\nSo the fractional variation is ΔF / F_unspot = [0.4πR² σ (T_unspot^4 - T_spot^4)] / [2πR² σ T_unspot^4] = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_unspot^4)]\n\nNow, the transit depth caused by a planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2, assuming it blocks a region at T_unspot. But since the observed flux is from the visible hemisphere, the transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * (T_planet^4 / T_unspot^4), but since the planet doesn't emit, it's just the blocked flux, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * T_unspot^4, and the observed flux is F_unspot = 2πR² σ T_unspot^4. Wait, no, the transit depth is the ratio of the blocked flux to the observed flux. If the planet blocks a flux of π Rpl² σ T_unspot^4, then the transit depth is (π Rpl² σ T_unspot^4) / (2πR² σ T_unspot^4) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2.\n\nSetting this equal to the spot-induced variation:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 / 2 = 0.2 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_unspot^4)]\n\n=> (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.4 [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_unspot^4)]\n\nNow, with T_spot = 5000 K and T_unspot ≈ 6080 K, let's compute this.\n\nFirst, compute (T_spot / T_unspot)^4 = (5000 / 6080)^4 ≈ (0.8219)^4 ≈ 0.456\n\nSo 1 - 0.456 ≈ 0.544\n\nMultiply by 0.4: 0.4 * 0.544 ≈ 0.2176\n\nThus, Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.2176) ≈ 0.466, which is still around 0.47, not matching any of the options. This suggests that there is a fundamental issue with my approach, or perhaps the problem expects a different method.\n\nLet me try a different angle. Let's assume that the effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K, and the rest of the star is at 6000 K, ignoring the inconsistency in total luminosity. This might be what the problem expects, despite the physical inconsistency.\n\nIn this case, the total luminosity would be less than 4πR² σ (6000)^4, but the problem might be asking for the comparison based on the observed flux from the visible hemisphere, not the total luminosity.\n\nSo, going back to the initial calculation where I ignored the total luminosity and just compared the flux from the visible hemispheres, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.32, which is option A. Given that this is one of the answer choices and the others are much smaller, it might be the intended answer, even though there is a physical inconsistency in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the spot-induced variation is equal to the transit depth, without considering the temperature difference. But that would be incorrect.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the problem is assuming that the spots are not causing a temperature difference but just blocking light, like a planet. But no, the problem states that the spots exhibit a temperature difference, so they are emitting less light, not blocking it.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that option A is 0.32, which is what I initially calculated, and the other options are much smaller, I think the intended answer is A: ~0.32.\n\nPerhaps the mistake in the second approach was considering the total luminosity, which the problem might not expect us to do, and instead just compare the flux from the visible hemisphere directly, assuming the rest of the star is at the same effective temperature, even if it leads to a total luminosity inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, going back to the first calculation where Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.32, which is option A, I think this is the expected answer.\n</think>"}
