Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, and then each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous ones. So Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂. The problem is asking for F₁₀₀ mod 4. Calculating F₁₀₀ directly seems really big because Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. There must be a smarter way than computing all terms up to 100, especially since we only care about the remainder when divided by 4. \n\nI recall something about the Fibonacci sequence having periodic remainders when divided by a number. This is called the Pisano period. If I can find the Pisano period for modulo 4, then I can figure out where 100 falls in that cycle and determine the remainder without computing all previous terms. \n\nLet me try to find the Pisano period for modulo 4. The Pisano period, π(n), is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo n repeats. For example, for modulo 2, the Pisano period is 3 because the sequence goes 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, etc. \n\nSo let me compute Fibonacci numbers modulo 4 until I see a repeat of the starting pair 1, 1. \n\nStarting with F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1:\n\nF₁ mod 4 = 1\n\nF₂ mod 4 = 1\n\nF₃ = F₂ + F₁ = 1 + 1 = 2 ⇒ 2 mod 4 = 2\n\nF₄ = F₃ + F₂ = 2 + 1 = 3 ⇒ 3 mod 4 = 3\n\nF₅ = F₄ + F₃ = 3 + 2 = 5 ⇒ 5 mod 4 = 1\n\nF₆ = F₅ + F₄ = 1 + 3 = 4 ⇒ 4 mod 4 = 0\n\nF₇ = F₆ + F₅ = 0 + 1 = 1 ⇒ 1 mod 4 = 1\n\nF₈ = F₇ + F₆ = 1 + 0 = 1 ⇒ 1 mod 4 = 1\n\nWait, so at F₇ and F₈, we have 1, 1 again. That means the Pisano period for modulo 4 starts repeating from here. Let me check:\n\nOriginal sequence modulo 4:\n\nTerm 1: 1\n\nTerm 2: 1\n\nTerm 3: 2\n\nTerm 4: 3\n\nTerm 5: 1\n\nTerm 6: 0\n\nTerm 7: 1\n\nTerm 8: 1\n\nSo between term 7 and term 8, it's back to 1, 1. Therefore, the Pisano period for modulo 4 is 6. Wait, because the period is the number of terms before the sequence repeats. From term 1 to term 6, we had 1,1,2,3,1,0 and then term 7,8 are 1,1. So the period is 6? Because after 6 terms, the sequence starts repeating? Let me check:\n\nIf the Pisano period π(4) is 6, then the sequence should repeat every 6 terms. Let me check term 7-12:\n\nTerm 7: 1\n\nTerm 8: 1\n\nTerm 9: 2 (same as term 3)\n\nTerm 10: 3 (same as term 4)\n\nTerm 11: 1 (same as term 5)\n\nTerm 12: 0 (same as term 6)\n\nTerm 13: 1 (same as term 7 and term 1)\n\nTerm 14: 1 (same as term 8 and term 2)\n\nYes, so the Pisano period for modulo 4 is indeed 6. That means the remainders repeat every 6 terms. Therefore, if I can find where 100 falls in this 6-term cycle, I can find F₁₀₀ mod 4.\n\nTo do this, I need to compute 100 divided by 6 and find the remainder. Let me do that. \n\nDividing 100 by 6: 6*16 = 96, so 100 = 6*16 + 4. Therefore, the remainder is 4. That means that F₁₀₀ mod 4 is the same as F₄ mod 4. \n\nLooking back at the sequence:\n\nTerm 1: 1\n\nTerm 2: 1\n\nTerm 3: 2\n\nTerm 4: 3\n\nTherefore, F₄ mod 4 is 3. So the remainder when F₁₀₀ is divided by 4 is 3?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, since the Pisano period is 6, then F_n mod 4 = F_{n mod 6} mod 4? Well, actually, it's slightly more nuanced. Because when the period is π, then F_{n} mod m = F_{n + kπ} mod m for any integer k. But to find n in terms of the period, we need to consider that if we have the period starting at term 1, then if we have n, we can compute the position in the cycle as (n - 1) mod π + 1? Or maybe n mod π?\n\nBut in our case, since the Pisano period starts repeating at term 7, which is 6 terms after the start. Let me check:\n\nFor example, term 7 corresponds to term 1 in the cycle, term 8 corresponds to term 2, etc. So term number in cycle is ((n - 1) mod π) + 1. Therefore, for n = 100:\n\nCompute (100 - 1) mod 6 + 1 = 99 mod 6 + 1. 99 divided by 6 is 16*6 = 96, remainder 3. Therefore, 99 mod 6 is 3, so position in cycle is 3 + 1 = 4. Which is term 4 in the cycle, which has value 3. Therefore, same result. So F₁₀₀ mod 4 is 3. \n\nBut let me check with smaller terms to ensure my logic is correct. For example, term 7: (7 - 1) mod 6 + 1 = 6 mod 6 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Term 1 is 1, term 7 is 1. Correct. Term 8: (8-1) mod 6 +1=7 mod 6=1 +1=2. Term 2 is 1, term 8 is 1. Wait, term 8 should correspond to term 2? Wait term 2 is 1, term 8 is 1. Correct. Term 3: term 9 should be same as term 3. Term 9: (9-1)=8 mod 6=2 +1=3. So term 3 is 2. Let me check term 9. Earlier I had term 9 as 2. Yes. Correct. So term 9 is 2. So seems correct. Therefore, term 100 corresponds to term 4 in the cycle, which is 3. Therefore, answer is 3. \n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I can check another way. Maybe compute Fibonacci numbers mod 4 up to, say, 12 terms and see if the cycle is indeed 6. \n\nEarlier terms:\n\nn : F(n) : F(n) mod 4\n\n1 : 1 : 1\n\n2 : 1 : 1\n\n3 : 2 : 2\n\n4 : 3 : 3\n\n5 : 5 : 1\n\n6 : 8 : 0\n\n7 : 13 : 1\n\n8 : 21 : 1\n\n9 : 34 : 2\n\n10 : 55 : 3\n\n11 : 89 : 1\n\n12 : 144 : 0\n\nYes, so the cycle is indeed 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0 and repeats. So every 6 terms. Therefore, term numbers:\n\n1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:1, 6:0,\n\n7:1, 8:1, 9:2,10:3,11:1,12:0,...\n\nSo if 100 divided by 6 gives quotient 16, remainder 4. So 6*16=96, so term 96 would be the same as term 6, which is 0. Then term 97 would be term 1: 1, term 98: term 2:1, term 99: term 3:2, term 100: term 4:3. Therefore, yes, term 100 mod 4 is 3. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute F₁₀₀ mod 4 by using matrix exponentiation or some formula, but that seems more complicated. But maybe for practice, let me try to compute some terms mod 4 up to, say, 12, which I did, and they match the cycle. So if I trust my Pisano period calculation, then 3 is the answer. \n\nBut maybe to make sure, let me compute a few more terms. Term 13: F13 = 233. 233 divided by 4: 4*58=232, so remainder 1. Which should be same as term 7, which was 1. Correct. Term 14: F14=377. 377 /4= 94*4=376, remainder 1. Same as term 8. Correct. Term 15: F15=610. 610 /4=152*4=608, remainder 2. Same as term 9: 2. Correct. Term 16: F16=987. 987-4*246=987-984=3. Same as term 10: 3. Correct. Term 17: 1597. 1597 /4: 4*399=1596, remainder 1. Same as term 11: 1. Correct. Term 18: 2584. 2584 /4=646, remainder 0. Same as term 12: 0. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the cycle is definitely 6. Therefore, my calculation for term 100 is correct. \n\nBut let me think again about how exactly the position in the cycle maps. Since the Pisano period is 6, then F(n mod 6) ? But need to be careful with off-by-one errors. For example, if n mod 6 is 0, that would correspond to the 6th term in the cycle. Let me think. \n\nIf we have n = 6, then 6 mod 6 is 0. But the 6th term mod 4 is 0. If n = 6*k, then it should correspond to term 6 in the cycle, which is 0. Similarly, n = 6k + 1, corresponds to term 1: 1. \n\nBut when I calculated earlier, I used (n - 1) mod 6 + 1. For n=100, (100 - 1)=99 mod 6 is 3, then +1=4. So term 4. Alternatively, if I think of it as n mod 6, but if n mod 6 is 0, then it's term 6. Let me check for n=6: 6 mod 6=0. If I say if it's 0, replace with π(m)=6, so term 6. For n=100, 100 mod 6 is 4 (since 6*16=96, 100-96=4). Therefore, 4 is not zero, so term 4. Therefore, in general, if we take n mod π, and if it's zero, then it's π, otherwise it's the remainder. Therefore, F(n) mod 4 = F( (n mod 6) ) mod 4, with the understanding that if n mod 6 is 0, then it's F(6) mod 4. \n\nTherefore, for n=100, 100 mod 6 is 4, so F(4) mod 4 = 3. Which is the same result. \n\nTherefore, this seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for Fibonacci numbers, but since Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, it's not feasible for n=100. Alternatively, using fast doubling method or matrix exponentiation mod 4. Maybe I can try that as another way to verify. \n\nThe fast doubling method uses the following formulas:\n\nF(2n-1) = F(n)^2 + F(n-1)^2\n\nF(2n) = F(n) * ( 2*F(n-1) + F(n) )\n\nBut since we are working mod 4, maybe we can compute recursively. However, for n=100, this might take some steps, but perhaps manageable. \n\nAlternatively, since we know the period is 6, and 100 mod 6 is 4, so F₁₀₀ mod 4 = F₄ mod 4 = 3. \n\nBut let me try to compute F₇ to F₁₂ using the recurrence mod 4 to check again:\n\nF₇ = F₆ + F₅ = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nF₈ = F₇ + F₆ = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nF₉ = F₈ + F₇ = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nF₁₀ = F₉ + F₈ = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nF₁₁ = F₁₀ + F₉ = 3 + 2 = 5 ≡ 1 mod 4\n\nF₁₂ = F₁₁ + F₁₀ = 1 + 3 = 4 ≡ 0 mod 4\n\nWhich is the same as before. So the cycle is indeed 6. Therefore, 100 divided by 6 is 16 with remainder 4. Therefore, F₁₀₀ ≡ F₄ ≡ 3 mod 4. \n\nBut maybe I can check with n=7 to n=12, which we did, and they match the first 6 terms. \n\nAlternatively, let me check term 6: 8, which is 0 mod 4. Term 12: 144, which is 0 mod 4. Term 18: 2584, which is 0 mod 4. So every multiple of 6, it's 0. Therefore, term 96 would be 0. Then term 97: term 1: 1, term 98: term 2:1, term 99: term 3:2, term 100: term 4:3. \n\nTherefore, yes, 3 is the remainder. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use induction or some other method. Suppose I want to confirm that the Pisano period is indeed 6. \n\nThe Pisano period for modulus m can be found by finding the sequence until it repeats 0, 1. Wait, actually, the Pisano period starts when the pair (0, 1) or (1, 1)? \n\nWait, the Pisano period π(m) is defined as the period after which the Fibonacci sequence modulo m repeats. For modulus m, the Pisano period starts with F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1. However, in our problem, the Fibonacci sequence starts with F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1. So depending on the indexing, there might be a shift. \n\nWait, this might be a point of confusion. Let me check. \n\nIn some definitions, the Fibonacci sequence starts with F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1. But in our problem, it starts with F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1. So there's a shift in indexing. \n\nTherefore, if I'm using Pisano period definitions that start at F₀, I need to adjust. \n\nLet me check. Let me recall that the Pisano period for modulus 4. \n\nIf starting from F₀:\n\nF₀ = 0\n\nF₁ = 1\n\nF₂ = 1\n\nF₃ = 2\n\nF₄ = 3\n\nF₅ = 5 ≡ 1\n\nF₆ = 8 ≡ 0\n\nF₇ = 13 ≡ 1\n\nF₈ = 21 ≡ 1\n\nSo here, the sequence mod 4 is:\n\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1,...\n\nSo the Pisano period here would be 6, since after F₆ = 0, F₇ = 1, F₈ = 1 which is similar to F₀, F₁, F₂. Therefore, π(4) = 6. \n\nBut in our problem, the first term is F₁ = 1, which corresponds to F₁ in the 0-based index. Therefore, if we want to relate our term numbers to the Pisano period, we have to adjust. \n\nIn the 0-based index, the Pisano period is 6. Therefore, F₀ mod 4 repeats every 6 terms. Therefore, F_n mod 4 = F_{n mod π} mod 4, but considering the 0-based index. \n\nIn our problem, we have 1-based index. Let me reconcile. \n\nIf our term is labeled as F₁, F₂,... in 1-based, then in 0-based it is F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, etc. \n\nOur problem is asking for F₁₀₀ (1-based). In 0-based index, that is F₉₉. \n\nSo if π(4) = 6 in 0-based, then F₉₉ mod 4 = F_{99 mod 6} mod 4. \n\nCompute 99 divided by 6: 6*16=96, remainder 3. Therefore, 99 mod 6=3. Therefore, F₉₉ mod 4 = F₃ mod 4. \n\nIn 0-based index, F₃ is 2, so 2 mod 4 is 2. Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 3. There is a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, hold on. This suggests that depending on the indexing, the answer differs. Which means I need to be very careful with the indexing. \n\nLet me check again. \n\nIn our problem, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,... So F₁=1, F₂=1, F₃=2, etc. \n\nIn the standard 0-based indexing, F₀=0, F₁=1, F₂=1, F₃=2, F₄=3, F₅=5, etc. \n\nTherefore, our F₁ corresponds to their F₁, our F₂ corresponds to their F₂, etc. \n\nSo if we want to compute our F₁₀₀ (1-based), it corresponds to their F₁₀₀ (1-based) which is same as their F_{99} in 0-based. \n\nTherefore, if we use the Pisano period for 0-based indexing, π(4)=6. Therefore, F_n mod 4 = F_{n mod π} mod 4 if n ≥ 0. \n\nBut wait, actually, the formula is a bit more nuanced. Because the Pisano period is the period with which the sequence repeats. For modulus m, once you have a pair of consecutive terms that are 0, 1, then the sequence will repeat. \n\nBut in general, for n ≥ 0, F_{n} mod m = F_{n + π(m)} mod m. \n\nTherefore, if we want to compute F_{99} mod 4, we can write 99 = q * π + r, where r is between 0 and π - 1. Then F_{99} mod 4 = F_r mod 4. \n\nSo π(4)=6. Therefore, 99 divided by 6 is 16 * 6 = 96, remainder 3. Therefore, r=3. Therefore, F_{99} mod 4 = F_3 mod 4. In 0-based, F_3 is 2. Therefore, 2. \n\nBut previously, using the 1-based approach, I thought the answer was 3. Which is conflicting. \n\nWait, so which one is correct? \n\nEarlier, I had computed that in 1-based terms, term 4 (which is F₄=3) mod 4 is 3, and since 100 mod 6=4, then answer is 3. But according to this 0-based calculation, since our term is F₁₀₀ (1-based) = F_{99} (0-based), which is F_{3} (0-based)=2. \n\nThere is a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have messed up the indexing somewhere. \n\nLet me check with a smaller term. Let's take term 7 in 1-based. \n\nIn 1-based, term 7 is F₇=13. 13 mod 4 is 1. \n\nIn 0-based, term 6 is F₆=8, which is 0 mod 4. Term 7 in 0-based is F₇=13, which is 1 mod 4. \n\nEarlier, using the 1-based Pisano approach, term 7 mod 6=1 (since 7 divided by 6 is 1 remainder 1). Therefore, corresponds to term 1 in the cycle. Term 1 in 1-based is 1, which matches. \n\nBut according to the 0-based calculation, F₇ (0-based) is F_{7} mod 4. π=6, so 7 mod 6=1, so F_1 mod 4=1. Which is same as term 1 in 0-based. \n\nBut term 7 in 1-based is term 6 in 0-based? No. Wait, term 7 in 1-based is term 6 in 0-based? No:\n\nWait 1-based index: F₁ corresponds to 0-based F₁. Therefore, 1-based index n corresponds to 0-based index n-1. \n\nTherefore, our F₁₀₀ (1-based) is 0-based index 99. \n\nSo to compute F_{99} (0-based) mod 4, we can use π(4)=6. \n\nCompute 99 divided by 6: 99 = 6*16 + 3. Therefore, remainder 3. Therefore, F_{99} mod 4 = F_3 mod 4. In 0-based, F_3 is 2. Therefore, answer is 2? But earlier, using the 1-based cycle, I thought it was 3. \n\nBut let's check with actual calculation. Let's compute term 100 in 1-based. \n\nEarlier, we saw the cycle in 1-based is 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0 repeating every 6 terms. \n\nSo term 1:1, term 2:1, term 3:2, term 4:3, term 5:1, term 6:0, term 7:1, term 8:1,...\n\nSo for term numbers:\n\nn mod 6:\n\nIf n ≡ 1 or 2 mod 6: remainder 1\n\nn ≡ 3 mod 6: remainder 2\n\nn ≡ 4 mod 6: remainder 3\n\nn ≡ 5 mod 6: remainder 1\n\nn ≡ 0 mod 6 (i.e., 6 mod 6): remainder 0\n\nSo for n=100, 100 mod 6=4, so remainder 3. \n\nBut according to the 0-based calculation, it was 2. \n\nTherefore, there is a conflict. Which one is correct? \n\nLet me check with n=7. In 1-based, term 7 is 1. 7 mod 6=1, so according to the 1-based cycle, it's term 1:1. Correct. In 0-based, term 7 (0-based) is F₇=13. Which is 1 mod 4. π(4)=6, 7 mod 6=1, so F_1=1. Correct. \n\nBut if I take term 4 in 1-based: n=4, which is 3 mod 4. According to 1-based cycle, remainder 3. \n\nIn 0-based, term 4 (1-based) is term 3 (0-based). F_3=2 mod 4=2. Wait, discrepancy here. \n\nWait term 4 in 1-based is F₄=3. In 0-based, that is F₃=2? Wait no:\n\nWait 1-based index: F₁=1=F₁ (0-based)\n\nF₂=1=F₂ (0-based)\n\nF₃=2=F₃ (0-based)\n\nF₄=3=F₄ (0-based)\n\nYes, so term 4 in 1-based is F₄ (0-based). Therefore, if I want to compute term 4 in 1-based mod 4, which is F₄ (0-based) mod 4=3. \n\nBut according to the previous 0-based Pisano calculation, if I have n=4 (0-based), which corresponds to 1-based term 5? No:\n\nWait, confusion again. Let me make a table:\n\n1-based index (our problem): n\n\n0-based index (standard): n-1\n\nTherefore:\n\nOur term 1: 0-based term 0: 0? Wait no:\n\nWait standard definition:\n\nF₀ = 0\n\nF₁ = 1\n\nF₂ = 1\n\nF₃ = 2\n\nF₄ = 3\n\nF₅ = 5\n\nF₆ = 8\n\nSo if our problem defines F₁ = 1, which is standard F₁, then our F_n corresponds to standard F_n. Therefore, our term 1 is standard F₁, term 2 is standard F₂, etc. Therefore, our term 100 is standard F₁₀₀. \n\nBut the Pisano period is usually defined with respect to standard indexing (0-based). However, the Pisano period π(m) is the period with which the sequence repeats. For modulus m, starting from F₀. \n\nSo for modulus 4, the sequence starting from F₀ is:\n\nn (0-based): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,...\n\nF(n):        0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,13,21,34,55,89,144,...\n\nF(n) mod 4: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1,  0,...\n\nSo here, the sequence mod 4 is 0,1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,2,3,1,0,... So the Pisano period here is 6, starting from n=0. The sequence repeats from n=6: 0,1,1,... which is same as n=0: 0,1,1,...\n\nTherefore, π(4)=6. Therefore, for any n ≥ 0, F(n) mod 4 = F(n mod 6) mod 4. However, note that for n=6, which is 0 mod 6, F(6) mod 4 = 0 = F(0) mod 4. \n\nTherefore, if we want to compute our term, which is F(100) in 1-based (standard F₁₀₀), we can compute n=100 in standard (0-based) is just F₁₀₀. To compute F(100) mod 4, we can compute 100 mod π(4)=6. \n\n100 divided by 6 is 16*6=96, remainder 4. Therefore, 100 mod 6=4. Therefore, F(100) mod 4=F(4) mod 4=3. Which matches our original 1-based calculation. \n\nWait, so why did I get confused earlier with the 0-based vs 1-based? Because earlier, I thought our term F₁₀₀ (1-based) was standard F₉₉ (0-based). But no! Our term F₁₀₀ (1-based) is standard F₁₀₀ (0-based). Wait, no:\n\nWait standard indexing is 0-based. Our problem's indexing is 1-based. Therefore, our F₁ is standard F₁, our F₂ is standard F₂,... our F₁₀₀ is standard F₁₀₀. Therefore, to compute standard F₁₀₀ mod 4, since π(4)=6, we compute 100 mod 6=4, so F₁₀₀ mod 4=F₄ mod 4=3. Which is correct. \n\nEarlier, I had mistakenly thought that our F₁₀₀ (1-based) was standard F₉₉ (0-based), but that is wrong. The confusion came from thinking that 1-based index corresponds to 0-based index-1, but only if our term is F_n (1-based) corresponds to standard F_{n-1} (0-based). However, in our problem, we are dealing with F₁₀₀ (1-based), which is standard F₁₀₀ (0-based). Wait, no! \n\nWait standard F₀ is 0, F₁ is 1. So if our problem says F₁ is 1, that is standard F₁. Therefore, our F_n (1-based) is standard F_n (0-based). Therefore, there is no shifting. \n\nWait, no! Wait standard F₀ is 0, which would be our... if our sequence started with F₀=0, but our sequence starts with F₁=1. Therefore, our F₁ corresponds to standard F₁, our F₂ corresponds to standard F₂, etc. Therefore, our F_n corresponds to standard F_n. Therefore, to compute our F₁₀₀ mod 4, it is standard F₁₀₀ mod 4, which is equal to standard F_{100 mod 6} mod 4=F_4 mod 4=3. \n\nEarlier, my confusion was when I thought of converting our term to 0-based index, but I incorrectly shifted. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3. Therefore, the previous calculation using the 1-based cycle was correct. \n\nSo where was the mistake earlier when I thought of converting to 0-based? I incorrectly thought that our term F₁₀₀ (1-based) was standard F₉₉ (0-based). But no, our F₁ (1-based) is standard F₁ (0-based). Therefore, our F₁₀₀ (1-based) is standard F₁₀₀ (0-based). Therefore, no shifting needed. Therefore, using π(4)=6, 100 mod 6=4, so F₁₀₀ mod 4=F₄ mod 4=3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3. \n\nTo confirm, let me compute F₇ mod 4 using both approaches. \n\nStandard F₇ (0-based) is 13, mod 4 is 1. Our term F₇ (1-based) is also 13, mod 4 is 1. \n\nUsing the formula: n=7, 7 mod 6=1. So standard F₁ mod 4=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: our term F₄ (1-based) is 3, which is standard F₄=3. 3 mod 4=3. Using formula, 4 mod 6=4, so standard F₄ mod 4=3. Correct. \n\nEarlier confusion was due to incorrect shifting between indexings. Therefore, conclusion is that the remainder is 3. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute F₇ to F₁₀ using the recurrence mod 4:\n\nAs before:\n\nTerm 7: 1\n\nTerm 8: 1\n\nTerm 9: 2\n\nTerm 10: 3\n\nWhich is same as terms 1-4. Therefore, every 6 terms it repeats. Therefore, term 100 is 6*16 + 4=100, so term 100 is same as term 4: 3. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is 3. \n\nTherefore, after careful consideration and checking multiple ways, I'm confident that the remainder when the 100th Fibonacci number is divided by 4 is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>"}
