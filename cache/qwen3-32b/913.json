I need to figure out which compound the unknown is based on the given data. The formula is C7H12O. The options are 3-Heptenal, 5-Methyl-4-Hexenal, 4-Methyl-4-Hexenal, and 4-Methyl-2-Cyclohexen-1-ol. Let me start by analyzing each piece of information.\n\nFirst, the FTIR shows a strong peak at 1725 cm⁻¹. That's a common place for a carbonyl group (C=O) stretch. But wait, the compounds listed—none of them have a carbonyl group except maybe if there's a ketone or aldehyde or carboxylic acid. Wait, the options include aldehydes and alcohols. Let me check the structures.\n\n3-Heptenal is CH2CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CHO? Wait, no. Wait, heptenal would be a 7-carbon chain with an aldehyde group. The formula for heptanal (which is the straight-chain aldehyde) is C7H14O. But our unknown is C7H12O. So maybe there's a double bond? Because each double bond reduces the number of hydrogens by 2. So if the formula is C7H12O instead of C7H14O, there's a double bond. So 3-Heptenal would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, and an aldehyde group. Let me check the molecular formula. For a 7-carbon aldehyde (which is C7H14O) with a double bond, the formula would be C7H12O. Because each double bond reduces H by 2. So that matches. Similarly, the other options might have different structures.\n\nNext, the 13C NMR has a peak at 134 ppm. Carbon signals in 13C NMR: carbonyl groups are around 170-220 ppm, aldehydes around 190-200. The peak at 134 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe a CH2 group next to a carbonyl? Or maybe a carbon in a double bond? For alkenes, the carbons are around 100-150 ppm. So 134 ppm could be a carbon in a double bond or a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's think.\n\nThe 1H NMR has a collection of 4 peaks in a 1:3:3:1 ratio at 5.2 ppm. That sounds like a quartet of quartets? Or maybe a multiplet? Wait, the 1:3:3:1 ratio is characteristic of a quartet, which is due to coupling with three equivalent protons. Wait, but the ratio is 1:3:3:1, which is typical for a quartet (n+1 rule where n=3). So if there's a proton that has three neighboring protons, it would split into a quartet. But the problem says \"a collection of 4 peaks in a 1:3:3:1 ratio at 5.2 ppm.\" That suggests a quartet, but the ratio is a bit confusing. Wait, a quartet is four peaks in the ratio 1:3:3:1. So that's a quartet. So that signal is a quartet. The chemical shift is 5.2 ppm. What kind of protons are at 5.2 ppm? That's in the range of alkenic protons (usually 4.5-6.5 ppm) or protons adjacent to an oxygen (like in ethers or alcohols, but alcohols are usually 1-5 ppm depending on environment). Alternatively, protons adjacent to a carbonyl group (like in aldehydes or ketones) can be around 2-3 ppm. But 5.2 ppm is higher, so maybe alkenic protons. Wait, but if the compound has a double bond, then there might be alkenic protons. Let me think.\n\nIf the compound is an aldehyde with a double bond, like 3-Heptenal, then the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH2CHO. Wait, but the formula would be C7H12O. Let me count. For 3-heptenal: the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CHO? No, wait, 3-heptenal would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CHO? Wait, no. Let me write it properly. A 7-carbon chain with an aldehyde group at the end (C1) and a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CHO? Wait, no. Let me think again. The aldehyde is at the end, so the chain is:\n\n1: CHO\n\n2: CH2\n\n3: CH2\n\nWait, no. The aldehyde is on carbon 1. So the structure would be:\n\n1: CHO\n\n2: CH2\n\n3: CH2\n\nBut wait, if the double bond is between 3 and 4, then the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's 7 carbons. Let me count:\n\n1: CHO\n\n2: CH2\n\n3: CH2\n\n4: CH\n\nWait, no. Let me write the structure properly. For 3-heptenal, the IUPAC name would be hept-3-enal. So the structure is CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CHO? Wait, no. Let me think again. The aldehyde is on carbon 1, and the double bond between 3 and 4. So the chain is:\n\n1: CHO\n\n2: CH2\n\n3: CH2\n\n4: CH\n\nWait, no. The correct structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Let me count the carbons. Carbon 1 is the aldehyde (CHO), carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH2, carbon 4 is CH (double bond), carbon 5 is CH2, carbon 6 is CH2, and carbon 7 is CH3? Wait, that's 7 carbons. So the formula would be C7H12O. Let me check: CHO (1 carbon), then CH2 (2), CH2 (3), CH (4), CH2 (5), CH2 (6), CH3 (7). Total carbons: 7. Hydrogens: Let's count. The aldehyde has 1 H (CHO), then each CH2 has 2 Hs, the CH=CH part: the CH has 1 H (since it's CH=CH2?), wait maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Let me count Hs. The aldehyde group (CHO) has 1 H. The next CH2 has 2 Hs. Next CH2 has 2 Hs. Then CH=CH2: the CH has 1 H, the CH2 has 2 Hs. Then the next CH2 has 2 Hs, and the CH3 has 3 Hs. So total Hs: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 13? Wait, but the formula is C7H12O. So maybe there's a mistake in my structure. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C3 and C4, making it a conjugated system? Let me try again.\n\nThe correct structure for 3-heptenal is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CHO? No, that would have the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no. The correct IUPAC name for 3-heptenal is hept-3-enal, which means the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Let me count the Hs here. The aldehyde (CHO) has 1 H. The first CH2 has 2 Hs. The second CH2 has 2 Hs. The CH=CH2 part: the first CH has 1 H (since it's CH=CH2?), but wait, actually, the structure is CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. So the CH=CH2 is between C4 and C5. The CH2 at C4 is actually CH2? Wait, no. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then the structure would be CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Let me count the hydrogens. The aldehyde (CHO) has 1 H. The first CH2 (C2) has 2 Hs. The second CH2 (C3) has 2 Hs. The CH=CH (C4 and C5): C4 is CH2? No, if there's a double bond between C3 and C4, then C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH2? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm misrepresenting the structure. Let me use proper nomenclature. The aldehyde is on C1, and the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Let me count the Hs. CHO has 1 H. Then CH2 (C2) has 2 Hs. The double bond between C3 and C4: C3 is CH2? No, if there's a double bond between C3 and C4, then C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH2? No, that's not right. The correct structure for a double bond between C3 and C4 would be CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would have a double bond between C4 and C5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me use the correct IUPAC numbering. For hept-3-enal, the aldehyde is at C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Let me count the hydrogens. The aldehyde (CHO) has 1 H. The first CH2 (C2) has 2 Hs. The second CH2 (C3) has 2 Hs. The CH=CH (C4 and C5): C4 is CH2? No, if there's a double bond between C3 and C4, then C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH2? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the structure is CHO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then the double bond is between C3 and C4. Let me count Hs. The aldehyde has 1 H. The first CH2 (C2) has 2 Hs. The double bond between C3 and C4: C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH2? No, if there's a double bond between C3 and C4, then the structure would be CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would have a double bond between C4 and C5. I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me try again. The correct structure for hept-3-enal is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C4 and C5. Wait, but the name is hept-3-enal, which means the double bond starts at C3. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. Therefore, the correct structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Let me count the Hs. Aldehyde: 1 H. C2: CH2 (2 Hs). C3: CH= (1 H). C4: CH2 (2 Hs). C5: CH2 (2 Hs). C6: CH3 (3 Hs). Total Hs: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11. Wait, but the formula is C7H12O. Hmm, this doesn't add up. Maybe there's a mistake in my structure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Wait, the molecular formula given is C7H12O. Let me check the formula for 3-heptenal. The formula for heptanal (straight-chain aldehyde) is C7H14O. If there's a double bond, it would reduce the H count by 2, making it C7H12O. So that matches. But according to my H count, I'm getting 11 Hs. Where's the mistake? Let me recount. The structure is CHO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Aldehyde: 1 H (the -CHO group has one H). Then:\n\n- C2: CH2 (2 Hs)\n- C3: CH (1 H) because of the double bond\n- C4: CH2 (2 Hs)\n- C5: CH2 (2 Hs)\n- C6: CH2 (2 Hs)\n- C7: CH3 (3 Hs)\n\nWait, but the structure is CHO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the aldehyde is on C1. C2 is CH2. C3 is CH (double bonded to C4). C4 is CH2. C5 is CH2. C6 is CH2. C7 is CH3. Wait, no. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH? No, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure for a double bond between C3 and C4 would be CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Let me count the Hs again. Aldehyde: 1 H. C2: CH2 (2 Hs). C3: CH2 (2 Hs). C4: CH (1 H) (since it's CH=CH2). C5: CH2 (2 Hs). C6: CH2 (2 Hs). C7: CH3 (3 Hs). Total Hs: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 13. Still not matching. Hmm. Maybe I'm not structuring it correctly. Let me use another approach. The molecular formula is C7H12O. For an aldehyde (R-CHO), the formula is CnH2nO. For n=7, that would be C7H14O. But our compound is C7H12O, which is two Hs less, indicating one double bond or a ring. Since it's an aldehyde, the double bond must be in the chain. So the structure would have one double bond and an aldehyde group. So the formula is correct.\n\nNow, back to the NMR data. The 1H NMR has a quartet (1:3:3:1) at 5.2 ppm. That suggests a proton that is coupled to three equivalent protons. The 1:3:3:1 ratio is a quartet, which is typical for a proton adjacent to three equivalent protons. For example, in an ethyl group (CH2CH3), the CH2 protons split into a quartet due to coupling with the three CH3 protons. But the chemical shift here is 5.2 ppm, which is higher than typical for CH2 protons next to a carbonyl group (which are around 2-3 ppm). So maybe this is a proton adjacent to a double bond?\n\nIn alkenes, protons on the double bond have chemical shifts between 4.5-6.5 ppm. So a proton at 5.2 ppm could be part of an alkene. If there's a double bond and the proton is adjacent to three equivalent protons, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH3 group in the alkene region. Wait, but the quartet would come from a CH2 next to a CH3. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-... but the chemical shift of the CH2 next to the double bond would be higher. Alternatively, maybe the proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond and also adjacent to a CH3 group. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, the CH2 next to the double bond would have a higher chemical shift and might split into a quartet due to coupling with the three CH3 protons. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, the quartet could be from a proton that's part of a CH group adjacent to a CH3 group and also adjacent to a double bond. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, the CH2 next to the CH3 is a CH2 that's adjacent to three CH3 protons, but the chemical shift would be around 1.2 ppm for the CH2 and 5.2 ppm for the CH in the double bond. Wait, maybe the proton in the quartet is the one on the CH group in the double bond that's adjacent to a CH2 group which is adjacent to a CH3 group. So the splitting would be due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 protons. Let me think.\n\nIf the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO, then the CH2 next to the double bond (the CH2 in CH2=CH) would have protons that are coupled to the CH protons in the double bond. But this is getting complicated. Maybe looking at the options would help.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA: 5-Methyl-4-hexenal\n\nB: 3-Heptenal\n\nC: 4-Methyl-4-hexenal\n\nD: 4-Methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol\n\nLet me consider each option.\n\nOption B: 3-Heptenal. As discussed, it has a double bond between C3 and C4 and an aldehyde group. The 1H NMR might have a quartet from the CH2 adjacent to a CH3 group. But the chemical shift at 5.2 ppm suggests a proton in the alkene region. Let's imagine the structure: CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. The protons on the double bond (CH=CH) would be at around 5-6 ppm. If there's a CH2 next to a CH3, like the terminal CH3, then the CH2 next to it would have a triplet (from coupling with CH3) at around 1 ppm. But the quartet at 5.2 ppm suggests a proton adjacent to three equivalent protons. Maybe the proton on the CH group in the double bond is adjacent to a CH2 group which is adjacent to a CH3 group. For example, in the structure, the CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO. The CH2 next to the CH3 would be a CH2 group that's adjacent to three CH3 protons. Wait, but the CH3 is at the end. Let me visualize:\n\nStructure: CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3.\n\nThe protons on the CH=CH part would be at 5-6 ppm. The CH2 next to the CH3 (C6) is CH2-CH3. The CH2 protons here would be a triplet (from coupling with CH3) at around 1 ppm. The CH2 next to the double bond (C4) is CH2-CH=CH. The protons here might be around 2-3 ppm and split into a quartet due to coupling with the CH protons in the double bond. But the given quartet is at 5.2 ppm, which is higher, so maybe the protons on the double bond themselves are the ones causing the quartet. But in a double bond with two CH groups, like CH2=CH-, the protons on the CH2 would be around 5 ppm and might split into a quartet if adjacent to three protons. Wait, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, then the CH2=CH part would have protons that are split into a quartet by the adjacent CH2. But I'm not sure.\n\nOption A: 5-Methyl-4-hexenal. The structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CHO? Wait, let me write it properly. The IUPAC name is 5-methylhex-4-enal. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CHO? No, let's think. The parent chain is hexanal (6 carbons) with a methyl group on C5 and a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3). Let me count the carbons. CHO is C1. C2 is CH2. C3 is CH2. C4 is CH=CH. C5 is CH(CH3). Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3). So the double bond is between C4 and C5. The methyl group is on C5. The molecular formula would be C7H12O. Let me check: CHO (1), CH2 (2), CH2 (3), CH=CH (4 and 5), CH(CH3) (5 and 6?), wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. The parent chain is hexanal (6 carbons), with a methyl group on C5. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3). That's 6 carbons in the parent chain. The methyl group is on C5, making it 7 carbons total. So the formula is C7H12O. The 1H NMR would have a quartet at 5.2 ppm. If the double bond is between C4 and C5, and there's a methyl group on C5, then the protons on the double bond might be adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be CH2-CH=CH. The protons on the CH2 would be around 2-3 ppm and might split into a quartet due to coupling with the CH protons in the double bond. But the given chemical shift is 5.2 ppm, which is more typical for alkene protons. Maybe the protons on the double bond itself are causing the quartet. If the double bond is between C4 and C5, and there's a methyl group on C5, then the structure might have a CH=CH(CH3) group. The protons on the CH=CH part would be in the alkene region. If there's a CH2 adjacent to three protons (like a CH3), then the CH2 would split into a quartet. But the chemical shift of the quartet is at 5.2 ppm, which is higher than typical for CH2 groups next to a carbonyl. So this might be the case for the CH2 next to the double bond. Let's imagine the structure: CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3). The CH2 next to the double bond (C4) is CH2-CH=CH. The protons on this CH2 would be at around 2-3 ppm and split into a quartet due to coupling with the CH protons in the double bond. But the given quartet is at 5.2 ppm, which is higher. Maybe the protons on the CH in the double bond are the ones that are splitting into a quartet. For example, if there's a CH group adjacent to a CH2 that has three protons. Let's say the structure has a CH2 adjacent to a CH group in the double bond. If the CH group is adjacent to a CH2 that has three protons (like a CH3), then the CH proton would split into a quartet. But the chemical shift of the CH proton would be around 5-6 ppm. So if there's a CH group in the double bond that's adjacent to a CH2 that has three protons (like a CH3), then the CH proton would split into a quartet and have a chemical shift of around 5.2 ppm. That matches the given data. So this could be the case for option A.\n\nOption C: 4-Methyl-4-hexenal. The structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CHO? No, the IUPAC name is 4-methylhex-4-enal. The parent chain is hexanal (6 carbons) with a methyl group on C4 and a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. Let me count the carbons. CHO is C1. C2 is CH2. C3 is CH2. C4 is CH(CH3). C5 is CH=CH2. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C5 and C6. The name is 4-methylhex-4-enal, so the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. Let me count the Hs. The aldehyde has 1 H. The first two CH2 groups have 2 Hs each. The CH(CH3) has 1 H (since it's CH(CH3)). The CH=CH2 has 1 H on the CH and 2 Hs on the CH2. Total Hs: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9. Wait, but the formula is C7H12O. Something's wrong here. Let me recount the structure properly. The correct structure for 4-methyl-4-hexenal would be:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. Wait, no. Let me think again. The parent chain is hexanal (6 carbons) with a methyl group on C4 and a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. Let me count the Hs. Aldehyde: 1 H. C2: CH2 (2 Hs). C3: CH2 (2 Hs). C4: CH(CH3) (1 H). C5: CH=CH2 (1 H on CH and 2 Hs on CH2). C6: CH2? No, the structure is CHO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. So the total Hs would be 1 (CHO) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 2 (C6) = 9 Hs. But the formula is C7H12O. This doesn't add up. There must be a mistake in my structure. Let me check the formula. For 4-methyl-4-hexenal, the formula would be C7H12O. Let me calculate it. The parent chain is hexanal (C6H12O) plus a methyl group on C4. Adding a methyl group adds a CH3, which is C and 3 Hs. But since the parent chain already has a double bond (which reduces H by 2), the formula would be C7H12O. But according to my H count, I'm getting 9 Hs. Where's the mistake? Let me try again. The correct structure for 4-methyl-4-hexenal is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. No, the correct structure should have the double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is:\n\nCHO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. Let me count the Hs again. Aldehyde: 1 H. C2: CH2 (2 Hs). C3: CH2 (2 Hs). C4: CH(CH3) (1 H). C5: CH=CH2 (1 H on CH and 2 Hs on CH2). C6: CH2? No, the structure is CHO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. So the total Hs would be 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9. Still not matching. Maybe there's another H somewhere. Perhaps the CH(CH3) has more Hs? Wait, the CH(CH3) has one H attached to the carbon with the methyl group. The methyl group has 3 Hs. So the total Hs from the methyl group is 3. Let me count again. Aldehyde: 1 H. C2: CH2 (2 Hs). C3: CH2 (2 Hs). C4: CH(CH3) has 1 H and the methyl group has 3 Hs. C5: CH=CH2 has 1 H on the CH and 2 Hs on the CH2. Total Hs: 1 + 2 + 2 + (1 + 3) + (1 + 2) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 12. Ah, there we go! I forgot to count the Hs on the methyl group. So the total is 12 Hs, which matches the formula C7H12O. Great. Now, the 1H NMR for this compound. The double bond is between C4 and C5. The protons on the CH=CH2 part would be in the alkene region (around 5 ppm). The CH2 next to the methyl group would be a CH2 that's adjacent to three protons (the methyl group), so it would split into a quartet. The chemical shift for this CH2 would be around 1-2 ppm, not 5.2 ppm. However, if the quartet is at 5.2 ppm, it might be the protons on the CH group in the double bond that are adjacent to a CH2 group which has three protons. For example, the CH in the double bond (C4) is adjacent to a CH2 group (C3) which has two protons, but if there's a methyl group on C4, then the CH2 next to the methyl group would have three protons. Wait, in this structure, the CH2 at C3 is adjacent to the CH(CH3) at C4. So the protons on C3's CH2 would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) at C4. The CH(CH3) has one proton. So the CH2 protons at C3 would split into a doublet. Not a quartet. The protons on the CH at C4 would be adjacent to the CH2 at C3 (two protons) and the methyl group (three protons). So the splitting would be complex. This doesn't seem to match the given quartet at 5.2 ppm.\n\nOption D: 4-Methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol. This is a cyclic compound with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The formula is C7H12O. Let's check. Cyclohexene has a double bond and one ring. The formula for cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a methyl group (CH3) adds one carbon and 3 Hs, making it C7H13. Adding a hydroxyl group (-OH) adds an oxygen and removes an H, making it C7H12O. So the formula matches. The FTIR shows a strong peak at 1725 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl group. But 4-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol has an alcohol group (OH), not a carbonyl. The FTIR peak at 1725 cm⁻¹ is for a carbonyl group (C=O), so this compound wouldn't have that peak. Therefore, option D can be eliminated.\n\nSo we're left with options A, B, and C. Let's revisit the 13C NMR. The spectrum shows a peak at 134 ppm. This is in the range of alkenes (100-150 ppm), so it's likely a carbon in the double bond. For option B (3-heptenal), the double bond is between C3 and C4. The carbon at the double bond would be around 120-140 ppm. For option A (5-methyl-4-hexenal), the double bond is between C4 and C5, so the carbons there would be around 120-140 ppm. For option C (4-methyl-4-hexenal), the double bond is between C4 and C5, and there's a methyl group on C4. The carbon at C4 would be a quaternary carbon (since it has a methyl group and a double bond), so its signal would be around 120-140 ppm. The peak at 134 ppm could be one of these double bond carbons.\n\nNow, the 1H NMR has a quartet at 5.2 ppm. For option A, if the double bond is between C4 and C5 and there's a methyl group on C5, then the CH2 adjacent to the methyl group would be next to three protons (the methyl group), leading to a quartet. The chemical shift of this CH2 would be around 1-2 ppm, not 5.2 ppm. However, if the protons on the CH in the double bond are adjacent to a CH2 that has three protons, then the CH proton would split into a quartet and have a chemical shift of around 5.2 ppm. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-... where the CH2 next to the CH is adjacent to a CH3 group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the double bond is between C4 and C5 and there's a methyl group on C5, then the protons on the CH (C4) would be adjacent to a CH2 (C3) which has two protons and a methyl group (C5) which has three protons. This could lead to a complex splitting pattern, but the chemical shift would be around 5 ppm. If there's a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 group in the alkene region, it's possible that the splitting results in a quartet at 5.2 ppm. This seems plausible for option A.\n\nFor option B, the quartet at 5.2 ppm might be from the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond, but their chemical shift would be around 2-3 ppm, not 5.2 ppm. Alternatively, if the protons on the CH in the double bond are adjacent to three protons, like in a structure where the CH is next to a CH2 that has three protons. For example, in 3-heptenal, the structure is CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. The CH in the double bond (C4) is adjacent to a CH2 (C3) which has two protons and a CH2 (C5) which has two protons. The protons on the CH would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on each side. This doesn't give a quartet. So option B might not fit the quartet at 5.2 ppm.\n\nOption C: 4-methyl-4-hexenal. The structure is CHO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. The CH2 next to the methyl group (C3) would be adjacent to three protons (the methyl group), leading to a quartet. The chemical shift for this CH2 would be around 1-2 ppm, not 5.2 ppm. The protons on the CH=CH2 part would be in the alkene region. The CH proton would be around 5-6 ppm. If this CH is adjacent to a CH2 that has two protons, it would split into a triplet, not a quartet. So option C might not fit the quartet at 5.2 ppm.\n\nPutting it all together: the FTIR peak at 1725 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, which all options have except D. The 13C peak at 134 ppm suggests an alkene carbon. The 1H NMR quartet at 5.2 ppm suggests a proton adjacent to three protons in the alkene region. This seems to fit option A (5-methyl-4-hexenal), where a proton in the alkene region is adjacent to a CH2 group that has three protons (like a methyl group), leading to a quartet at 5.2 ppm. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 5-Methyl-4-Hexenal.\n</think>"}
