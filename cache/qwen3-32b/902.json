Hmm, let me recall the ideal gas law. The formula is PV = nRT, right? Where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nSince the question is about how pressure changes when temperature and volume change, I should probably look at how P relates to T and V. Let me rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for pressure. If I divide both sides by V, I get P = nRT / V. So pressure is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to volume. \n\nNow, the problem says the temperature is increased by a factor of 2. So if the original temperature is T, the new temperature is 2T. And the volume is increased by a factor of 8, so if the original volume is V, the new volume is 8V. \n\nLet me substitute these into the equation for pressure. The original pressure is P = nRT / V. The new pressure, let's call it P', would be nR(2T) divided by (8V). Let me write that out: P' = (nR * 2T) / (8V). \n\nSimplifying that, the 2T over 8V can be reduced. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: that gives (nR * T) / (4V). Comparing that to the original pressure P, which was nRT / V, the new pressure P' is P divided by 4. So P' = P / 4. That means the pressure decreases by a factor of 4. \n\nWait, let me check if I did that right. If temperature doubles, that would tend to increase pressure, but volume increases by 8 times, which would decrease pressure. Since pressure is proportional to T/V, so if T doubles and V increases by 8, the overall effect is (2/8) = 1/4. So yes, pressure is multiplied by 1/4, meaning it decreases by a factor of 4. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option B says P decreases by a factor of 4. That seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up direct and inverse proportions. Since P is directly proportional to T, increasing T increases P. But P is inversely proportional to V, so increasing V decreases P. So when both happen, the combined effect is multiplying by 2 (from T) and dividing by 8 (from V), which is 2/8 = 1/4. So yes, P becomes 1/4 of the original. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n</think>"}
