Let me start by recalling the units involved here. The given speed is 20 feet per minute, and I need to convert that to inches per second. \n\nFirst, I know that there are 12 inches in a foot. So, if the bicycle is moving 20 feet in one minute, I can convert feet to inches by multiplying by 12. That should give me the number of inches the bicycle travels in a minute. Let me write that down: 20 feet/minute * 12 inches/foot. The feet unit cancels out, leaving inches per minute. \n\nBut wait, the problem asks for inches per second, not per minute. So after converting to inches per minute, I need to convert minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, right? So if I take the inches per minute and divide by 60, that should give me inches per second. \n\nLet me check my steps again. Starting with 20 feet per minute. Multiply by 12 inches per foot to get inches per minute. Then divide by 60 seconds per minute to get inches per second. That makes sense because dividing by 60 converts the time unit from minutes to seconds. \n\nLet me do the math step by step. First, 20 times 12 is... 20 * 12. Let me calculate that. 20 times 10 is 200, and 20 times 2 is 40, so 200 + 40 = 240. So that gives me 240 inches per minute. \n\nNow, converting that to inches per second. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, I divide 240 by 60. 240 divided by 60 is... 4. So 4 inches per second. \n\nWait, let me verify that again. If something is moving 240 inches in one minute, then in one second it would move 240 divided by 60, which is indeed 4 inches. That seems right. \n\nBut maybe I should double-check the unit conversions to make sure I didn't mix up anything. So feet to inches is correct (12 inches per foot), and minutes to seconds is 60 seconds per minute. Multiplying by 12 and then dividing by 60. So another way to think about it is 20 feet per minute multiplied by (12 inches / 1 foot) * (1 minute / 60 seconds). The feet unit cancels with the foot in the denominator, and the minutes cancel with the minute in the numerator. So you're left with inches in the numerator and seconds in the denominator, which is inches per second. \n\nSo the calculation would be 20 * 12 / 60. Let me compute that again. 20 * 12 = 240. 240 / 60 = 4. Yep, that's 4 inches per second. \n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by converting feet to inches and minutes to seconds first? Let me see. If I want to find how many inches the bicycle travels in one second, I can take the original speed and adjust both units. \n\nSo 20 feet per minute is the same as 20/60 feet per second, right? Because dividing by 60 converts minutes to seconds. 20 divided by 60 is 1/3 of a foot per second. Then converting that to inches, since 1 foot is 12 inches, 1/3 foot per second is 12*(1/3) inches per second, which is 4 inches per second. \n\nSame answer. So that confirms it. \n\nAnother check: Let's think about real-world context. 20 feet per minute is a pretty slow speed. How does that compare to inches per second? Well, 20 feet per minute is about how fast someone might walk, maybe a bit slower. Let's see, 4 inches per second. If you think about how many inches in a second, 4 inches is about 10 centimeters per second. That does seem slow if you're talking about a bicycle. Wait, hold on, is 20 feet per minute really that slow? Let me convert 20 feet per minute to miles per hour to get a better sense. \n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me just check the conversion again. 20 feet per minute to inches per second. 20 * 12 = 240 inches per minute. 240 / 60 = 4 inches per second. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about how many seconds it takes to go one inch. If it's 4 inches per second, then in one second, the bike moves 4 inches. So in 15 seconds, it would move 60 inches, which is 5 feet. In one minute (60 seconds), that would be 60 * 4 = 240 inches, which is 20 feet. Perfect, that matches the original value. So the conversion checks out. \n\nTherefore, the bicycle's speed is 4 inches per second. \n\nI think that's solid. Both methods of converting feet to inches first and then minutes to seconds, and converting minutes to seconds first and then feet to inches, give the same result. The cross-checking also shows that the original value is recovered when converting back. So I'm confident the answer is 4 inches per second.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe bicycle's speed is \\boxed{4} inches per second.\n</think>"}
