So, the question is about how many moles of oxygen gas are produced when 4.32 grams of mercury(II) oxide decomposes. The formula mass of mercury(II) oxide is given as 216 g/mol. The options are A to D, and I need to find the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the chemical reaction involved here. The problem states that Joseph Priestly decomposed solid mercury(II) oxide into oxygen gas and liquid mercury metal. The formula for mercury(II) oxide is HgO. So, the decomposition reaction would be breaking down HgO into O₂ and Hg. Let me write that out:\n\nHgO(s) → O₂(g) + Hg(l)\n\nBut wait, I need to balance this equation. Let me check the number of atoms on each side. On the left, there's 1 Hg and 1 O. On the right, there's 1 Hg and 2 O in the O₂. So, the oxygen isn't balanced. Let me try to balance it. To balance the oxygen, since there's one O in HgO and two in O₂, I need to have two HgO molecules on the left to get two O atoms, which can then form one O₂ molecule. So:\n\n2 HgO(s) → O₂(g) + 2 Hg(l)\n\nLet me check again. Left side: 2 Hg and 2 O. Right side: 2 Hg (from 2 Hg) and 2 O (from O₂). Yep, that's balanced. So the balanced equation is 2 HgO → O₂ + 2 Hg.\n\nNow, the next step is to find out how many moles of HgO are in 4.32 grams. The formula mass of HgO is given as 216 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass.\n\nCalculating moles of HgO: 4.32 g / 216 g/mol. Let me do that division. 4.32 divided by 216. Hmm, 216 goes into 4.32... Well, 216 times 0.02 is 4.32, right? Because 216 * 0.02 = 4.32. So that would be 0.02 moles of HgO.\n\nWait, let me verify. 216 * 0.02 is 4.32. Yes, so 4.32 / 216 = 0.02 mol. So moles of HgO is 0.02 mol.\n\nNow, using the balanced equation, the mole ratio between HgO and O₂. From the balanced equation: 2 moles of HgO produce 1 mole of O₂. So the ratio is 2 HgO : 1 O₂. Therefore, moles of O₂ = moles of HgO * (1/2).\n\nSo, moles of O₂ = 0.02 mol * (1/2) = 0.01 mol.\n\nLooking at the answer choices: B is 0.0100 mol. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Balanced equation: 2 HgO → O₂ + 2 Hg. Correct.\n\n2. Calculated moles of HgO: 4.32 g / 216 g/mol. Let me compute that again. 4.32 divided by 216. Let's do it step by step. 216 g per mole, so 1 mole is 216 grams. 4.32 grams is how many moles? 4.32 / 216 = 0.02. Yes, because 216 * 0.02 = 4.32. So that's correct.\n\n3. Mole ratio: 2 HgO gives 1 O₂. So 0.02 moles of HgO would give 0.01 moles of O₂. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: 0.0100 mol. Let me check the options again:\n\nA: 0.100 mol (that's 0.1, which is 10 times more than 0.01)\n\nB: 0.0100 mol (matches our calculation)\n\nC: 0.0200 mol (double of our answer, which would be if the ratio was 1:1 instead of 2:1)\n\nD: 0.0150 mol (maybe if someone thought the formula mass was different or miscalculated the ratio)\n\nSo, unless I made a mistake in the balanced equation, which I don't think I did, the correct answer is B.\n\nWait another thought: Is the formula mass of HgO actually 216 g/mol? Let me verify. Mercury's atomic mass is approximately 200.59 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. So HgO would be 200.59 + 16.00 = 216.59 g/mol. The problem says the formula mass is 216 g/mol, which is a rounded number. So that's acceptable. So the given molar mass is correct for the purposes of this problem.\n\nSo with that, the calculation is correct. 4.32 g divided by 216 g/mol is 0.02 mol HgO. 0.02 divided by 2 is 0.01 mol O₂. So answer B.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes in my reasoning. Answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
