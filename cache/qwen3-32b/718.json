The question is about identifying the incorrect statement regarding chemical knowledge in some Chinese technological achievements. There are four options: A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each option is talking about. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nOption A: BeiDou-3 satellite has a rubidium atomic clock. Rubidium (Rb) is a metallic element. Well, I know that rubidium is an alkali metal, right? It's in the same group as sodium and potassium. So it's definitely a metallic element. So A is correct. So the incorrect one is not A.\n\nOption B: Fendouzhe submersible's manned cabin shell used Zhao alloy, and it says Mem alloy belongs to inorganic non-metallic materials. Wait, first, I'm not sure if \"Zhao alloy\" is a real term. Maybe it's a mistranslation or a typo. But assuming that's the case, the key part here is that the alloy is categorized as inorganic non-metallic. But alloys are typically metallic materials. Alloys are mixtures of metals or metals with other elements, but the main component is metal. For example, steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. So if the option says that an alloy is an inorganic non-metallic material, that's incorrect. Because alloys are metallic materials. So B is incorrect. But wait, maybe \"Mem alloy\" is something else? Maybe the term is wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to a ceramic or composite. But generally, alloys are metallic. So B's statement is incorrect. So B is the incorrect judgment.\n\nOption C: Long March 5B rocket's power source from oxidation-reduction reactions. Rockets use propellants that undergo combustion, which is a redox reaction. For example, liquid hydrogen and oxygen, or other fuels with oxidizers. So oxidation-reduction reactions are definitely involved. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: Tianwen-1 used a Kevlar parachute. Kevlar is a synthetic fiber, a polymer. It's a high molecular material (high polymer). So D is correct. Therefore, the incorrect one is B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The key in B is the material classification. Alloys are metallic materials, so if the option states that the Mem alloy (assuming that's the same as Zhao alloy, maybe a typo or mistranslation) is inorganic non-metallic, that's wrong. Therefore, B is the incorrect statement. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
