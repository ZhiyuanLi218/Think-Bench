The answer choices are given, so maybe I can work through the problem step by step and see which one makes sense. Let me start by recalling what I know about particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\nFirst, the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²). The question mentions that E is equal to π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level can be written as E_n = n²E. That simplifies things because instead of dealing with all those constants, I can just use E and multiply by n squared.\n\nNow, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. However, since each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins, the maximum number of particles per spatial orbital is 2. But wait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So each particle has spin 1/2, so their total spin can be either up or down. But since they are identical fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. For spin-1/2 particles in a spatial configuration, the total wavefunction is a product of spatial and spin parts. If the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric, and vice versa. However, when filling up the lowest energy states, we usually consider the case where the spin part is a singlet or symmetric, but maybe I need not get into that here. \n\nBut for the purpose of filling the energy levels, since each spatial orbital can hold two particles (with spin up and spin down), I can think of each energy level E_n as being able to hold two particles. So, to find the ground state, I need to fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, making sure that each spatial orbital is filled with two particles (if possible) before moving to the next higher energy level.\n\nLet me start by considering the ground state. For four particles, each spatial orbital can hold two particles. The lowest energy level is n=1, which can hold two particles. Then the next level is n=2, which can also hold two particles. So if I put two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2, that would account for all four particles. Therefore, the total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. That seems to match option A's ground state of 10E, but let me check the other options. Option B says ground state is 4E, which would be if all four particles were in n=1, but that's impossible due to Pauli exclusion. So 10E is the correct ground state energy. So options A, B, C, D have different numbers. Let me check the other options. Option B has ground state 4E, which is wrong. Option C also has 4E, same problem. Option D has 30E as ground state, which is way too high. So only option A and B have 10E as first or second... Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: ground is 10E, first excited is 15E, second is 18E.\n\nOption B: ground is 4E, first is 10E, second is 15E.\n\nOption C: ground is 4E, first is 10E, second is 50E.\n\nOption D: ground is 30E, first is 39E, second is 50E.\n\nSo from my calculation, the ground state is 10E, so only option A and maybe others? Wait, no, only option A has ground state 10E. So options B, C, D have wrong ground state. But let me make sure. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nFour spin-1/2 particles. Each spatial orbital can hold two particles. So for four particles, we need two spatial orbitals. The lowest two orbitals are n=1 and n=2. Each filled with two particles. Therefore total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Yes, that seems right. So ground state is 10E. Therefore options B, C, D are out because their ground states are different. Therefore the correct answer must be option A. But let me check the excited states to confirm.\n\nFirst excited state. How do we get the first excited state? For fermions, the excited states are obtained by promoting one or more particles to higher energy levels while keeping the others in the lowest possible states. However, since all particles are in the lowest available states in the ground state, the first excited state would involve moving one of the particles to the next available energy level.\n\nBut let's think carefully. In the ground state, we have two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2. To get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle to the next available state. However, since each spatial orbital can hold two particles, the next available state would be n=3. But which particle do we promote? Well, to get the first excited state, we need the minimal increase in energy. So we should promote the highest occupied particle to the next available state. In the ground state, the highest occupied energy level is n=2. So if we take one particle from n=2 and put it into n=3, then the configuration would be two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3. Let's calculate the energy for this configuration: 2*(1²E) + 1*(2²E) + 1*(3²E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. So that would be 15E. Which matches option A's first excited state. \n\nNow, the second excited state. Again, we need to figure out the next possible configuration. There are different ways to get excited states. The second excited state could be either promoting another particle or promoting the same particle further. But we need to figure out which configuration has the next higher energy.\n\nIn the ground state, we had two in 1, two in 2. First excited is two in 1, one in 2, one in 3. What's the next one? It could be either:\n\n1. Promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in 1, zero in 2, two in 3. But wait, we have four particles. If we have two in 1, zero in 2, two in 3, that's four particles. Let's calculate the energy: 2*(1²E) + 2*(3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E. But 20E isn't one of the options given. Alternatively, maybe we promote one particle from n=2 to n=4? Let's see. If we have two in 1, one in 2, one in 4. Then energy is 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Still not matching. Alternatively, maybe instead of promoting from n=2, we could promote one of the particles in n=1? Wait, but the lowest energy promotion would be to promote the highest occupied, which is n=2. Alternatively, another possibility is that the second excited state is when we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (which is first excited), and then the next one would be two in 1, one in 2, and one in 4? Which would be higher than promoting another to n=3? Or maybe another configuration?\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. What if we have one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3? But that would require moving a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would be a higher energy cost. Let's see. Original ground state is two in 1, two in 2. If we move one from n=1 to n=3, then we have one in 1, two in 2, one in 3. The energy is 1*E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. So that's 18E. Which is one of the options given in A as the second excited state. So now we have two possibilities for the first excited states? Wait, no. The first excited state was 15E by moving one from n=2 to n=3. The next one could be either 18E by moving one from n=1 to n=3 or 20E by moving two from n=2 to n=3. Which one comes first? Which has lower energy?\n\nSo, moving one particle from n=2 (energy 4E) to n=3 (energy 9E) increases the energy by 5E. Whereas moving one particle from n=1 (energy 1E) to n=3 (energy 9E) increases the energy by 8E. Therefore, moving from n=2 to n=3 gives a smaller increase. Therefore, the first excited state is 15E, and the next one would be 18E. Therefore, the second excited state is 18E. Therefore option A says ground 10E, first 15E, second 18E. Which matches. Let me check if there is another configuration with energy between 15E and 18E. For example, moving one particle from n=2 to n=4? That would be an increase of 16E - 4E = 12E, which would result in total energy of original ground state (10E) plus 12E? Wait no. Original total energy was 10E. If we remove one particle from n=2 (which contributes 4E) and put it into n=4 (which contributes 16E), so the total energy becomes 10E - 4E + 16E = 22E. Which is higher than 18E. So no. How about moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3? That would be two particles in n=3. The total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 0*(2²E) + 2*(3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E. Which is higher than 18E. Therefore, the next after 15E is 18E. Therefore, the answer is option A: 10E, 15E, 18E.\n\nBut let me just think again. Maybe there's another way to arrange the particles? For example, maybe having two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4? But that would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Not helpful. Or two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (which is 15E), then the next one would be moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3, making it 20E. But 18E is lower. So 18E is the next one. Therefore, the second excited state is 18E. So option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's a configuration that I haven't considered. For example, maybe two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), then another configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (18E). Since 15E is lower than 18E, the first excited is 15E, second is 18E. Therefore, option A is correct. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the second excited state. If the first excited state is 15E, then the second excited state is the next one. So if there is another state with energy between 15E and 18E, then 18E would not be the second. But since there isn't, then yes. Alternatively, maybe there is another configuration. For example, if we have one particle in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3? That would be 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. No. Or one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3? That is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Which is same as moving one particle from n=1 to n=3. So that is another way to reach 18E. Therefore, that is the next energy level. Therefore, the second excited state is 18E. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option A: 10E, 15E, 18E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
