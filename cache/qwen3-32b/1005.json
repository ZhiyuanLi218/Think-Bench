Right now, Denali has 16 dogs and Nate has 12 dogs. There's a new policy where they can be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs. The problem says that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same in two different scenarios:\n\n1. If Denali starts walking 4x more dogs and Nate stays at 12 dogs.\n2. If x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.\n\nWe need to find x, given that x is not zero.\n\nLet me break this down. The pay ratio depends on the number of dogs each is walking. So originally, the ratio is 16:12, which simplifies to 4:3, but the problem is talking about different scenarios where this ratio remains the same under two different changes.\n\nFirst scenario: Denali gets 4x more dogs. So Denali's new number of dogs is 16 + 4x. Nate's remains 12. So the ratio here would be (16 + 4x)/12.\n\nSecond scenario: x dogs are moved from Nate to Denali. So Denali's new number is 16 + x, and Nate's is 12 - x. The ratio here is (16 + x)/(12 - x).\n\nAccording to the problem, these two ratios are equal. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n(16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x)\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nFirst, cross-multiplied:\n\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: (16 + 4x)(12 - x)\n\nMultiply it out:\n\n16*12 - 16x + 4x*12 - 4x*x\n\nCompute each term:\n\n16*12 is 192.\n\n-16x + 48x is 32x.\n\n-4x².\n\nSo left side is 192 + 32x - 4x².\n\nRight side: 12*(16 + x) = 192 + 12x.\n\nSo now set up the equation:\n\n192 + 32x - 4x² = 192 + 12x\n\nSubtract 192 from both sides:\n\n32x - 4x² = 12x\n\nSubtract 12x from both sides:\n\n20x - 4x² = 0\n\nFactor out 4x:\n\n4x(5 - x) = 0\n\nSo, 4x = 0 or 5 - x = 0.\n\nBut x ≠ 0, so 5 - x = 0 => x = 5.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to 4x(5 - x) = 0, so solutions are x = 0 or x = 5. Since x ≠ 0, the answer is 5.\n\nBut let me verify with the original problem to make sure.\n\nFirst scenario: Denali walks 4x more dogs. If x = 5, then Denali has 16 + 20 = 36 dogs. Nate still has 12. So ratio is 36/12 = 3.\n\nSecond scenario: x dogs moved from Nate to Denali. So Denali has 16 + 5 = 21, Nate has 12 - 5 = 7. Ratio is 21/7 = 3. Okay, same ratio. So that works. Therefore x = 5 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my algebra again just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n(16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n\nLeft side expansion:\n\n16*12 - 16x + 4x*12 - 4x^2\n\nWhich is 192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 32x - 4x^2. Correct.\n\nRight side: 192 + 12x. Correct.\n\nThen subtract 192: 32x - 4x² = 12x. Subtract 12x: 20x - 4x² = 0. Factor: 4x(5 - x) = 0. Correct. So x=5 is the solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5. Seems straightforward. Maybe check if there's another interpretation of the problem?\n\nThe problem says \"assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs.\" So maybe there's something about groups? But in the first scenario, they assign 4x more dogs. If they are assigned in groups of x, then 4x would mean 4 groups. Similarly, in the second scenario, moving x dogs is one group. Maybe that's just extra info and doesn't affect the math? Since the problem says \"assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs,\" so any change has to be in multiples of x. But in the first scenario, Denali is getting 4x more dogs. So that would be 4 groups of x dogs added. The problem doesn't specify whether Nate is also having dogs added or removed in groups of x, but in the first scenario, Nate stays at 12 dogs. So maybe that's okay. The problem says \"assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs.\" So maybe when they assign or unassign, it's done in groups of x. So if Denali is getting 4x dogs, that's 4 groups. If Nate is losing x dogs, that's one group. So the problem is consistent with groups of x. So I think the original setup is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5. So x=5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ x $ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n</think>"}
