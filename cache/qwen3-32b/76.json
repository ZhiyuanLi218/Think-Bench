This means they **do not have permanent dipole-dipole interactions** or **hydrogen bonds**, which are typically stronger intermolecular forces. Instead, the dominant intermolecular force in these molecules is **London dispersion forces** (also known as induced dipole-induced dipole interactions). These are **temporary attractive forces** that arise from the momentary uneven distribution of electrons in molecules.\n\n---\n\n### Why Melting Point Increases with Carbon Chain Length\n\nAs the number of carbon atoms increases:\n- The **size and surface area** of the molecule increase.\n- The **number of electrons** increases, which enhances the **polarizability** of the molecule.\n- This leads to **stronger London dispersion forces** between the molecules.\n\nThese stronger intermolecular forces require **more energy** to overcome, resulting in a **higher melting point**.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n- **A: Increasing mass of the compounds**  \n  While it's true that the mass increases with more carbon atoms, mass alone does not directly determine melting point. It is the **intermolecular forces** that dictate how much energy is needed to separate the molecules, not just the mass.\n\n- **B: Increasing polarity of the compounds**  \n  Hydrocarbons are **nonpolar**, so their polarity does not significantly increase with chain length. Therefore, this is not a valid reason for the increase in melting point.\n\n- **C: Increasing number of induced dipoles per molecule**  \n  This is correct. As the molecule becomes longer, the **probability of temporary dipoles (induced dipoles)** increases due to the larger number of electrons and greater surface area. These induced dipoles lead to **stronger London dispersion forces**, which in turn require **more energy** to break, resulting in a higher melting point.\n\n- **D: Increased probability of hydrogen bonds**  \n  Hydrocarbons **do not form hydrogen bonds**, as they lack the necessary functional groups (like O-H or N-H). So this is not a valid explanation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about why the melting point of straight-chain hydrocarbons increases with more carbon atoms. The options are A to D. I need to figure out the correct reason.\n\nFirst, I remember that melting point relates to the strength of intermolecular forces. Stronger forces mean higher melting points because you need more energy to break them. Hydrocarbons are nonpolar, right? So they don't have hydrogen bonds or permanent dipoles. That might eliminate some options.\n\nOption A says increasing mass. Well, larger molecules do have higher molar masses, but how does that affect melting point? I think mass alone isn't the main factor here. Maybe more about the surface area or how molecules pack together. But maybe mass contributes to something else.\n\nOption B is increasing polarity. But hydrocarbons are nonpolar. Unless there's some induction happening. Wait, induced dipoles are temporary dipoles from electron movement. So maybe that's related to London dispersion forces. So if the molecule is bigger, it can have more induced dipoles?\n\nOption C says increasing number of induced dipoles per molecule. If there are more carbon atoms, the molecule is longer. London forces depend on the size and surface area of the molecule. Larger molecules have more electrons, so stronger London forces. That makes sense. So more carbons mean more induced dipoles possible, leading to stronger intermolecular forces, hence higher melting point.\n\nOption D is hydrogen bonds. But hydrocarbons don't have hydrogen bonds because they don't have O-H or N-H bonds. So D is probably wrong.\n\nSo between A and C. A is about mass. But mass isn't directly the reason. The main reason is the strength of the intermolecular forces. Since hydrocarbons have London dispersion forces, which increase with molecular size and surface area. So more carbons mean larger molecules, more induced dipoles (London forces), so higher melting points. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but why isn't it A? Because even though mass increases, the main factor is the intermolecular forces. For example, if you compare methane (CH4) and decane (C10H22), decane has a much higher molar mass, but the key is that the dispersion forces are stronger. So even though mass is part of it, the actual reason is the induced dipoles. So option C is correct.\n</think>"}
