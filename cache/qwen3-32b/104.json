Let me start by understanding exactly what this notation means. \n\nFirst, let's recall what a factorial is. For a number n, n! means the product of all positive integers up to n. So 4! is 4×3×2×1 = 24. Got that. \n\nNow, the superfactorial n$ is defined as a tower of exponents where each level is n! and the height of the tower is also n!. So for 4$, that would be a tower of 4! = 24 copies of 4! stacked as exponents. So it's 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 copies of 24. \n\nBut since we only care about the units digit, maybe there's a pattern or some modular arithmetic trick we can use here. Because calculating such a huge number directly is obviously impossible. \n\nLet me recall that the units digit of a number is the same as the number modulo 10. So if I can compute 4$ mod 10, that will give me the units digit. \n\nBut exponentiation towers can be tricky with modular arithmetic. I remember something about Euler's theorem or Euler's totient function being useful here. Let me recall: Euler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. \n\nSo maybe I can use Euler's theorem recursively here? Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's note that 4$ is a tower of 24 24s. So we need to compute 24^24^...^24 mod 10. \n\nBut since we're dealing with exponents, maybe we can reduce the exponents modulo φ(10), then φ(φ(10)), etc., depending on the level of the tower. However, this requires that the base and modulus are coprime. \n\nWait, first let me check if 24 and 10 are coprime. The GCD of 24 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. That complicates things because Euler's theorem requires coprimality. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Since 10 = 2 × 5, perhaps compute the value modulo 2 and modulo 5, then combine them. But since we need the units digit, maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for patterns in the powers of 24 modulo 10. Let's see:\n\n24 mod 10 is 4. So 24^k mod 10 is the same as 4^k mod 10. \n\nSo maybe we can simplify the problem by noting that 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, so 24^anything mod 10 is equivalent to 4^anything mod 10. Therefore, the entire tower modulo 10 is equivalent to a tower of 4s of height 24, modulo 10. \n\nWait, but the original tower is 24 copies of 24. But since each 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, but exponents are not straightforward because exponentiation isn't linear. However, maybe we can still reduce the exponents modulo something. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let me denote T(k) as a tower of k 4s. So T(1) = 4, T(2) = 4^4, T(3) = 4^(4^4), and so on. Then our problem reduces to finding T(24) mod 10. \n\nSo if I can compute T(24) mod 10, that will be the answer. \n\nNow, to compute T(24) mod 10. Let's see. Let's try to find a pattern or periodicity in the exponents. \n\nFirst, let's note that 4^k mod 10 cycles with some period. Let's check:\n\n4^1 = 4 mod 10\n\n4^2 = 16 ≡ 6 mod 10\n\n4^3 = 4^2 * 4 ≡ 6 * 4 = 24 ≡ 4 mod 10\n\n4^4 ≡ 4 * 4 = 16 ≡ 6 mod 10\n\nSo it cycles every 2: 4, 6, 4, 6,... So the pattern is periodic with period 2. Therefore, if we can find whether the exponent is odd or even, we can determine if the result is 4 or 6 mod 10. \n\nTherefore, for T(n) mod 10, if n ≥ 2, then T(n) = 4^(T(n-1)). Therefore, if T(n-1) is even, then 4^(T(n-1)) ≡ 6 mod 10; if T(n-1) is odd, then it's 4 mod 10. \n\nBut since T(n-1) is itself a tower of 4s of height n-1. Let's check for small n:\n\nFor n=1: T(1)=4 mod 10 = 4\n\nn=2: T(2)=4^4=256 ≡ 6 mod 10. Since exponent is 4 which is even, so 6. Correct.\n\nn=3: T(3)=4^256. Since 256 is even, so 4^even ≡ 6 mod 10. So T(3) ≡ 6 mod 10.\n\nn=4: T(4)=4^(T(3))=4^... Since T(3) is 6 mod 10, but actually, more importantly, T(3) is even (since it's 4^something which is even). Therefore, exponent is even, so 4^even ≡ 6 mod 10. Therefore, T(4) ≡ 6 mod 10. \n\nWait, so from n=2 onwards, T(n) ≡ 6 mod 10? Because for n=2, exponent is 4 (even); n=3, exponent is T(2)=256 (even); n=4, exponent is T(3) which is 4^256, which is even, etc. So regardless of how tall the tower is, as long as it's at least 2, the exponent is even, so 4^even ≡ 6 mod 10. \n\nTherefore, T(n) mod 10 is 6 for all n ≥ 2. \n\nBut wait, our problem is T(24). Since 24 ≥ 2, then T(24) mod 10 is 6. Therefore, the units digit is 6. \n\nBut let me check again. Let me verify with n=3. T(3)=4^(4^4)=4^256. 256 is even, so 4^even ends with 6. Correct. Similarly, T(4)=4^T(3)=4^(...). Since T(3) is even, so again 6. So regardless of how high the tower is, as long as it's at least 2, the result mod 10 is 6. \n\nTherefore, 4$ which is T(24) mod 10 is 6. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. Because maybe there's a step I missed here. Because when dealing with exponents modulo something, we can't just reduce the exponent modulo some number unless certain conditions hold. \n\nFor example, when we have a^b mod m, if we want to reduce the exponent b modulo φ(m), we need that a and m are coprime. In this case, 4 and 10 are not coprime, so Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. \n\nBut earlier, I noticed that 4^k mod 10 cycles every 2, regardless of k. So maybe I can use that cycle. \n\nBut let's think again. Let me formalize:\n\nWe want to compute 4^k mod 10. As observed, this cycles with period 2 when k ≥ 1. \n\nBut the cycle depends on k mod 2. If k is even, 4^k ≡ 6 mod 10; if odd, 4^k ≡ 4 mod 10. \n\nTherefore, to compute 4^k mod 10, we just need to know whether k is even or odd. \n\nTherefore, for T(n) = 4^T(n-1), we need to determine if T(n-1) is even or odd. \n\nSo let's analyze T(n-1)'s parity. \n\nT(1) = 4, which is even.\n\nT(2) = 4^4. Since 4 is even, any power of 4 is even. So T(2) is even.\n\nSimilarly, T(3) = 4^(T(2)) = 4^even. Since 4^even is even. So T(3) is even.\n\nIn fact, by induction, all T(n) for n ≥ 1 are even. Therefore, for T(n) with n ≥ 2, the exponent T(n-1) is even, so 4^even ≡ 6 mod 10. \n\nTherefore, regardless of how tall the tower is, as long as it's at least 2, the result mod 10 is 6. Therefore, T(24) mod 10 is 6. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4$ is 6. \n\nBut let me check for n=2, 4$ would be... Wait, no, 4$ is specifically defined as a tower of 4! = 24 copies of 4!. But earlier, I converted each 24 to 4 mod 10, but is that valid?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't skip a step here. \n\nOriginal problem: 4$ is a tower of 24 copies of 24. So it's 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 copies. \n\nBut since we want this mod 10, and 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, but exponents are not mod 10. However, when you have a^b mod m, sometimes you can reduce the exponent mod φ(m), provided that a and m are coprime. \n\nBut since 24 and 10 are not coprime, maybe we need to approach this differently. \n\nWait, but earlier I considered that 24^anything mod 10 is same as 4^anything mod 10. Is that correct?\n\nYes, because 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, so 24^k ≡ 4^k mod 10. Therefore, regardless of what k is, the entire tower mod 10 is same as the tower of 4s mod 10. Therefore, my previous reasoning applies. \n\nTherefore, since the tower of 24 24s mod 10 is same as tower of 24 4s mod 10, which is T(24) as I defined before, which is 6 mod 10. \n\nBut let me test with smaller numbers to check my logic. Let's take n=2. Then 2$ is a tower of 2! = 2 copies of 2! = 2. So 2^2 = 4. Units digit 4. \n\nBut according to my previous logic, T(2) is 4^4 = 256 ≡ 6 mod 10. Wait, but here, if n=2, 2$ is 2^2, not 4^4. Wait, so there's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, so my mistake was in the substitution. Let me re-examine. \n\nOriginal problem: For n$, it's a tower of n! copies of n!. So for n=2, 2$ is 2!^2! = 2^2 = 4. \n\nBut if I tried to use my previous approach, I would have said that since n! = 2, which is 2 mod 10, so tower of 2 copies of 2, which is 2^2. But if I tried to convert each 2 to 2 mod 10, which it is, but if I thought of it as a tower of 2s. However, if I had thought of it as a tower of n! where n! is 2, so same thing. \n\nBut if I tried to use my previous logic for n=2, then according to my previous logic, T(2) would be 4^4? No, that was wrong. Wait, no. Wait, my mistake was that I considered T(k) as a tower of k 4s, but in reality, for general n, the tower is of n! copies of n!.\n\nBut in my case, for 4$, n! is 24, so it's a tower of 24 copies of 24. However, when I tried to reduce each 24 to 4 mod 10, I need to make sure that the exponents can be reduced. \n\nBut for the first level, 24^something mod 10 is 4^something mod 10. However, the exponent itself is another tower, which is 24^... So maybe my substitution is okay, but when I considered T(k) as a tower of k 4s, that was perhaps conflating variables. Let me try again. \n\nLet me denote that the tower is 24 copies of 24. Let me call this E. So E = 24^24^24^...^24 (24 times). We need E mod 10. \n\nSince 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, then E ≡ 4^24^24^...^24 mod 10 (with 24 copies of 24). However, the exponent itself is 24^...^24 (23 copies). Let me denote the exponent as E1. Then E ≡ 4^E1 mod 10. \n\nAs before, 4^k mod 10 is 4 if k odd, 6 if k even. Therefore, need to determine if E1 is even or odd. \n\nE1 is 24^24^...^24 with 23 copies. Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. Therefore, E1 is even. Therefore, 4^E1 ≡ 6 mod 10. Therefore, E ≡ 6 mod 10. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the height of the tower (as long as it's at least 2), since all exponents beyond the first are even, leading to 4^even ≡ 6 mod 10. \n\nBut let me test this with n=2. For n=2, the tower is 2 copies of 2, so 2^2=4. According to the above logic, E would be 2^E1 where E1 is 2 (since there is 1 copy left). Then 2^E1 mod 10. However, in this case, the base is 2, not 4. Therefore, my previous logic was specific to when the base is 4. \n\nSo my mistake earlier was generalizing T(k) as towers of 4s, but actually for different n, the base is n! which may be different. However, in our specific case of n=4, the base is 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, so the same logic applies. \n\nBut for n=2, since the base is 2, which mod 10 is 2, and the analysis would be different. However, since we're focusing on n=4, let's stick to that. \n\nSo for our problem, since the base is 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, and the exponent is a tower of 23 copies of 24. Since 24 is even, any tower of 24s with height ≥ 1 is even. Therefore, the exponent E1 is even. Therefore, 4^E1 mod 10 is 6. \n\nTherefore, regardless of how big the tower is, as long as the height is ≥ 2, the result mod 10 is 6. Wait, but for height 1, it's 24 mod 10 = 4. \n\nTherefore, since our tower has height 24, which is ≥ 2, then the units digit is 6. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 6. \n\nBut let me try to check this with another approach to be sure. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that we need to compute 24^^24 mod 10, where ^^ denotes the tetration (the exponent tower). \n\nAs mentioned, 24 ≡ 4 mod 10. So 24^^24 ≡ 4^^24 mod 10. \n\nNow, let's analyze 4^^k mod 10 for different k. \n\nAs we saw:\n\n4^^1 = 4 mod 10 = 4\n\n4^^2 = 4^4 = 256 ≡ 6 mod 10\n\n4^^3 = 4^(4^4) = 4^256. Since 256 is even, 4^even ≡ 6 mod 10.\n\nSimilarly, 4^^4 = 4^(4^^3) = 4^... with exponent being 6 mod something. But since the exponent is 4^^3 which is 6, but actually, more importantly, it's even, so again 4^even ≡ 6 mod 10. \n\nTherefore, for k ≥ 2, 4^^k ≡ 6 mod 10. \n\nTherefore, 4^^24 ≡ 6 mod 10. Therefore, 24^^24 ≡ 6 mod 10. \n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6. \n\nAnother check: Let's think about the general case for modulus 10. Since 4 is even and 10 is 2×5. Maybe we can use Chinese Remainder Theorem by finding the value mod 2 and mod 5, then combining them. \n\nBut let's try that. \n\nFirst, compute E = 24^^24 mod 2 and mod 5, then combine. \n\nStarting with mod 2: \n\n24 is even, so any power tower of 24s is even. Therefore, E ≡ 0 mod 2. \n\nNow mod 5: \n\nWe need to compute E = 24^^24 mod 5. Since 24 ≡ 4 mod 5. Therefore, E ≡ 4^^24 mod 5. \n\nLet me analyze 4^^k mod 5. \n\nFirst, compute 4^k mod 5. \n\nNote that φ(5) = 4. Since 4 and 5 are coprime. \n\nSo 4^k mod 5 cycles every φ(5)=4. \n\nBut since we have a tower, let's analyze recursively. \n\nLet me denote F(k) = 4^^k mod 5. \n\nF(1) = 4 mod 5 = 4\n\nF(2) = 4^4 mod 5. 4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 ≡ 1^2 = 1 mod 5. \n\nF(3) = 4^(F(2)) mod 5 = 4^1 mod 5 = 4 mod 5. \n\nF(4) = 4^(F(3)) mod 5 = 4^4 mod 5 = 1 mod 5. \n\nSo we see a pattern: For k ≥ 1, F(k) alternates between 4 and 1 depending on whether k is odd or even. Specifically:\n\nIf k is odd, F(k) = 4 mod 5\n\nIf k is even, F(k) = 1 mod 5\n\nSince our case is k=24, which is even, so F(24) = 1 mod 5. \n\nTherefore, E ≡ 1 mod 5 and E ≡ 0 mod 2. \n\nNow, find a number x such that:\n\nx ≡ 0 mod 2\n\nx ≡ 1 mod 5\n\nSolutions to this are numbers congruent to 6 mod 10 (since 6 mod 2 is 0, 6 mod 5 is 1). The next one is 16, 26, etc. But since we are looking for x mod 10, the solution is 6. \n\nTherefore, combining mod 2 and mod 5 gives us x ≡ 6 mod 10, which matches our previous conclusion. \n\nTherefore, this confirms that the units digit is 6. \n\nTherefore, after multiple approaches and checks, I can be confident that the units digit of 4$ is 6. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe units digit of $4\\$ is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>"}
