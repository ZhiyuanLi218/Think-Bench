The initial mass is m₀, and the gas ejection rate is constant. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that rocket motion is governed by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, but that usually assumes that the acceleration is due to the thrust and gravity. However, in this case, the problem states that the rocket is accelerating at a constant acceleration of n g. So maybe I need to relate the thrust force to the acceleration and then find the mass flow rate?\n\nLet me recall Newton's second law for variable mass systems. The general equation is:\n\nF_ext = m * a + v_rel * (dm/dt)\n\nWhere F_ext is the external force, m is the mass of the rocket at time t, a is its acceleration, v_rel is the relative velocity of the ejected mass (exhaust velocity), and dm/dt is the rate of change of the rocket's mass. Wait, actually, I think the correct form might be:\n\nThe thrust force is given by v_rel * (dm/dt), and the net force on the rocket is thrust minus gravity equals m * a.\n\nSo let me write that out. The net force F_net is equal to thrust minus the gravitational force. The thrust is the exhaust velocity times the mass ejection rate. But here, the problem says the rate of gas ejection is constant. Let me denote the mass ejection rate as -dm/dt, since the mass of the rocket is decreasing. Let me define the exhaust velocity as u (usually denoted by v_exh or something, but let's use u here). \n\nSo thrust T = u * (dm/dt)_gas. But since the rocket's mass is decreasing, (dm/dt)_rocket = - (dm/dt)_gas. Let me denote (dm/dt)_rocket as just dm/dt for simplicity. Therefore, thrust T = -u * (dm/dt).\n\nNow, the net force on the rocket is T - m g = m * a, where a is the acceleration of the rocket. Wait, but the problem says the acceleration is n g. So substituting that in:\n\nT - m g = m * (n g)\n\nSo substituting T:\n\n- u * (dm/dt) - m g = m n g\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the signs again. The thrust is upward, and gravity is downward. So if upward is positive, then net force is T - m g = m a. But the thrust T is equal to u times the mass ejection rate. However, the mass ejection rate is negative because the rocket is losing mass. Wait, maybe I need to be careful with the sign here.\n\nLet me think again. The thrust force is generated by expelling mass at velocity u relative to the rocket. If the rocket is ejecting mass at a rate of, say, λ (mass per unit time), then the thrust is λ u. But since the rocket's mass is m(t), and λ is the rate of mass ejection, then dm/dt = -λ. Therefore, λ = - dm/dt. Therefore, thrust T = u * λ = - u (dm/dt). \n\nSo going back to the net force equation:\n\nT - m g = m a\n\nSubstituting T:\n\n- u (dm/dt) - m g = m a\n\nBut the problem states that the acceleration a is n g. So:\n\n- u (dm/dt) - m g = m (n g)\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n- u (dm/dt) = m (n g) + m g = m g (n + 1)\n\nTherefore,\n\ndm/dt = - [m g (n + 1)] / u\n\nSo the rate of change of the rocket's mass is negative, which makes sense because the mass is decreasing. But the problem says \"find the rate of change of the rocket's mass,\" and since they might want the magnitude, or maybe expressed as a positive number? Wait, but the question says \"the rate of change,\" so probably they want the expression with the negative sign, unless specified otherwise. However, let me check if there are any missing factors here.\n\nWait, is the acceleration a = n g upward? So the net acceleration is n g. So the equation seems okay. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the general form of the rocket equation. The rocket equation in a gravitational field is:\n\na = (u / m) (dm/dt) - g\n\nBut here, acceleration a is given as n g. Wait, but in this case, the acceleration is upward, so maybe:\n\na = (thrust / m) - g\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\na = [ - u (dm/dt) / m ] - g\n\nWait, hold on. If the thrust is T = - u (dm/dt), then thrust over m is -u (dm/dt)/m. But acceleration due to thrust would be positive upward, so perhaps the correct expression is:\n\na = (T / m) - g = [ - u (dm/dt) / m ] - g ?\n\nWait, but if dm/dt is negative, then - u (dm/dt) is positive, so that term is positive. Let me write it again:\n\nT is upward, equal to - u (dm/dt). So T/m is upward acceleration due to thrust. Then net acceleration is T/m - g = a.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[ - u (dm/dt) / m ] - g = a\n\nWhich rearranged is:\n\n- u (dm/dt) / m = a + g\n\nMultiply both sides by -m:\n\nu (dm/dt) = - m (a + g )\n\nTherefore,\n\ndm/dt = - m (a + g ) / u\n\nSince a is given as n g, substitute:\n\ndm/dt = - m (n g + g ) / u = - m g (n + 1) / u\n\nSo that's the same result as before. Therefore, the rate of change of the rocket's mass is dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u. However, the problem says \"the rate of gas ejection is constant.\" Wait, the rate of gas ejection is constant. In my notation, the mass ejection rate is - dm/dt = λ, which would be constant. However, according to the equation above, dm/dt is proportional to m. Wait, but if dm/dt is proportional to m, then unless u or other variables are changing, this would mean that the mass ejection rate is not constant, unless m is constant. But m is changing over time. Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction here. Wait, the problem says \"the rate of gas ejection is constant.\" So maybe I misunderstood the problem?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Assuming air resistance is negligible and the rate of gas ejection is constant, find the rate of change of the rocket's mass.\"\n\nSo the rate of gas ejection is constant. If \"rate of gas ejection\" refers to the mass flow rate, then that is λ = - dm/dt = constant. But according to our previous equation, dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u, which would mean that dm/dt is proportional to m, so unless m is constant, which it isn't, the mass flow rate isn't constant. Therefore, something is wrong here. There must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of \"rate of gas ejection\". If the rate of gas ejection is constant, does that mean the mass flow rate is constant (i.e., λ = constant), or does it mean something else?\n\nLet me think again. If the rocket engine is designed to eject gas at a constant rate, that usually refers to a constant mass flow rate, i.e., λ = -dm/dt = constant. However, according to the equation we derived, if the rocket has a constant acceleration, then dm/dt is proportional to m, which would not be constant unless m is constant. But if m is constant, then dm/dt is zero, which would imply from the equation:\n\ndm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u = 0 only if m=0 or other terms zero, which is impossible. Therefore, there is an inconsistency here. \n\nWait, but the problem says both that the rocket has a constant acceleration and that the rate of gas ejection is constant. How can both be true? If the rate of gas ejection is constant (λ = constant), then dm/dt = -λ. Let me try plugging that into the equation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nNet force = thrust - weight = m * a\n\nThrust is λ u, since λ is mass per unit time, multiplied by exhaust velocity u. Therefore:\n\nλ u - m g = m a\n\nBut here, acceleration a is n g, so:\n\nλ u - m g = m n g => λ u = m (n + 1) g => λ = m (n + 1) g / u\n\nBut λ is supposed to be constant. However, m is changing over time, so unless m is constant, λ cannot be constant. Therefore, unless the problem is assuming that m is approximately constant? But the problem says \"find the rate of change of the rocket's mass,\" so probably m is not constant. Therefore, there is a contradiction unless we reconcile these.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the rate of gas ejection is constant\". Maybe \"rate of gas ejection\" refers to the volumetric rate? But no, usually, in rocketry, the rate of gas ejection is mass flow rate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different definition?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the exhaust velocity is variable to maintain constant mass flow rate and constant acceleration? But the problem says \"the rate of gas ejection is constant\", and we are to find dm/dt. But according to our previous analysis, if the rocket has a constant acceleration, then dm/dt is proportional to m, so unless there's another factor.\n\nWait, maybe I made a wrong assumption in the equation. Let me check again.\n\nThe correct equation for the rocket's acceleration in a gravitational field is:\n\na = (u / m) * (dm/dt) - g\n\nBut here, the acceleration a is given as n g. Wait, but dm/dt is negative, so:\n\na = - (u / m) * |dm/dt| - g ?\n\nWait, perhaps my sign conventions are messed up. Let me be precise.\n\nLet me define upward as positive. The rocket is ejecting mass downward at a speed u relative to the rocket. The thrust force is therefore upward and equal to u * (dm/dt)_ejected. Since the rocket's mass is decreasing, (dm/dt)_rocket = - (dm/dt)_ejected. Let me denote (dm/dt)_ejected as λ, which is positive. Therefore, (dm/dt)_rocket = -λ. The thrust is then T = u λ.\n\nThe net force on the rocket is T - m g = m a. Therefore:\n\nu λ - m g = m a => u λ = m (a + g)\n\nTherefore, solving for λ:\n\nλ = [m (a + g)] / u\n\nBut the problem says that the rate of gas ejection (λ) is constant. Therefore:\n\nλ = [m (a + g)] / u = constant\n\nBut if λ is constant, then m must change in such a way that m is proportional to 1/(a + g). However, the acceleration a is given as constant (n g). Therefore, if a is constant, then m must be constant? But that contradicts the fact that the rocket is losing mass. Therefore, there is a contradiction here unless a is not constant. But the problem says the rocket ascends with a constant acceleration of n g. \n\nThis suggests that if the rate of gas ejection is constant (λ constant), then the acceleration cannot be constant unless the mass is constant, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be something wrong in my reasoning.\n\nWait, but the problem says both that the acceleration is constant and the rate of gas ejection is constant. Therefore, maybe the exhaust velocity is not constant? But the problem does not mention anything about the exhaust velocity. Alternatively, maybe there's another force? No, the problem says to neglect air resistance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the rocket equation is different. Let me recall the correct form of the rocket equation with external forces.\n\nThe general equation of motion for a rocket is:\n\nm dv/dt = v_exh * (dm/dt) - F_gravity\n\nBut here, dv/dt is the acceleration a, which is n g. Wait, let me check the derivation.\n\nThe momentum change of the rocket is equal to the thrust minus external forces. The thrust is v_exh * (dm/dt)_ejected. Since (dm/dt)_rocket = - (dm/dt)_ejected, then:\n\nm a = v_exh (- dm/dt) - m g\n\nWhich rearranged is:\n\nm a = - v_exh (dm/dt) - m g\n\nWhich is the same as before:\n\n- v_exh (dm/dt) = m (a + g)\n\nSo dm/dt = - [m (a + g)] / v_exh\n\nTherefore, if the acceleration a is constant, then dm/dt is proportional to m, which implies that the mass flow rate is not constant unless m is constant. But the problem says the rate of gas ejection is constant. Therefore, this suggests that the problem might have conflicting conditions, or perhaps I misinterpret \"rate of gas ejection\".\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"Assuming air resistance is negligible and the rate of gas ejection is constant, find the rate of change of the rocket's mass.\"\n\nAh! Maybe \"rate of gas ejection\" refers to the rate of change of the rocket's mass, i.e., dm/dt is constant? But the problem says \"find the rate of change of the rocket's mass\", which would be dm/dt. If the rate of gas ejection is constant, then dm/dt is constant. But then how can the acceleration be constant? Let me try this.\n\nAssume that dm/dt is constant (let's call it -λ, so λ is positive). Then, using the equation:\n\nm a = - v_exh (dm/dt) - m g => m a = v_exh λ - m g\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\na = [v_exh λ / m] - g\n\nBut if a is constant (n g), and dm/dt is constant (so m = m₀ - λ t), then:\n\nn g = [v_exh λ / (m₀ - λ t)] - g\n\nWhich would require v_exh λ / (m₀ - λ t) = g (n + 1)\n\nBut this would mean that v_exh depends on time unless λ = 0, which is not possible. Therefore, unless the exhaust velocity is changing with time, which is not mentioned in the problem, this is impossible. Therefore, the problem seems contradictory.\n\nBut since the problem says both the acceleration is constant and the rate of gas ejection is constant, there must be a way to resolve this. Perhaps the problem is in another frame or there's something else?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not in English originally, and \"rate of gas ejection is constant\" refers to something else? For example, maybe the velocity of ejection is constant? But that is usually assumed anyway. Or maybe the problem assumes that the gravitational acceleration is also changing? No, it says uniform gravitational field.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different definition where the \"rate of gas ejection\" is the mass flow rate per unit thrust or something else? Unlikely.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again:\n\n\"In a uniform gravitational field, a rocket with an initial mass of m₀ ascends vertically with a constant acceleration of n g (where g is the gravitational acceleration). Assuming air resistance is negligible and the rate of gas ejection is constant, find the rate of change of the rocket's mass.\"\n\nSo, the problem says \"rate of gas ejection is constant\". In standard terminology, that would be mass flow rate, which is dm/dt (negative). However, according to our previous equations, if the rocket has a constant acceleration, then dm/dt is not constant, but proportional to m. Therefore, the problem seems contradictory. However, since the problem is given, there must be a solution. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the equation?\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe using the concept of variable mass.\n\nThe equation of motion for a body with variable mass is:\n\nF_ext + v_rel (dm/dt) = m (dv/dt)\n\nWhere F_ext is the external force, v_rel is the velocity of the ejected mass relative to the rocket, and dm/dt is the rate of change of the mass of the rocket.\n\nIn this case, the external force is gravity, which is -m g (since it's downward). The relative velocity v_rel is -u (if u is the exhaust speed relative to the rocket, downward). The acceleration dv/dt is given as a = n g upward.\n\nSo plugging into the equation:\n\nF_ext + v_rel (dm/dt) = m a\n\n=> (-m g) + (-u)(dm/dt) = m (n g)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the signs again carefully.\n\nThe external force F_ext is gravity, which is acting downward, so if upward is positive, F_ext = -m g.\n\nThe term v_rel (dm/dt): v_rel is the velocity of the ejected mass relative to the rocket. Since the rocket is going upward, and it ejects gas downward, the relative velocity is downward, so v_rel = -u (if u is a positive number representing the speed). The dm/dt is negative because the rocket is losing mass, so dm/dt = -λ (where λ > 0 is the mass ejection rate). Therefore, v_rel * dm/dt = (-u)(-λ) = +u λ.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n- m g + u λ = m a\n\nWhich is the same as before:\n\nu λ = m (a + g)\n\nSo if the problem states that the rate of gas ejection is constant, meaning λ is constant, then:\n\nλ = [m (a + g)] / u\n\nBut since λ is constant and a is constant (n g), this implies that m must change over time such that m(t) is proportional to 1/(a + g). But since a is constant, m(t) would need to be constant, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution unless we relax some assumptions.\n\nHowever, the problem asks to find dm/dt given that the rate of gas ejection is constant and the acceleration is constant. Therefore, maybe the problem assumes that the term involving dm/dt in the equation is negligible? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for dm/dt in terms of other variables, assuming that the rate of gas ejection is constant, but in reality, the rate of gas ejection isn't constant. Wait, but the problem says \"the rate of gas ejection is constant\", so we have to take that as given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding between the rate of gas ejection and the rate of change of the rocket's mass. If the rate of gas ejection is constant, then dm/dt is constant, and we can find it from the equation.\n\nLet me try that. Assume dm/dt is constant (let's say k = dm/dt, negative value). Then from the equation:\n\nu * (-k) - m g = m a => -u k = m (a + g) => k = - m (a + g)/u\n\nBut k is dm/dt, which we are assuming constant. However, m is changing over time, so unless m is constant, this equation cannot hold. Therefore, unless the mass is constant, which it isn't, this is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution unless the problem is ill-posed.\n\nBut since the problem is given, there must be something wrong in my reasoning. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not in the Earth's gravitational field but in a uniform gravitational field where g is constant, but maybe the rocket is not near the Earth? No, that shouldn't matter.\n\nWait, let me think about dimensional analysis. The rate of change of mass should have units of kg/s. The equation dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u. Let's check the units: m is kg, g is m/s², u is m/s, so overall units are kg * m/s² / (m/s) = kg/s. Correct. So the equation is dimensionally consistent. Therefore, if we accept that dm/dt is proportional to m, then even though the rate of gas ejection (which is -dm/dt) is not constant, but depends on m, which is changing. However, the problem says \"the rate of gas ejection is constant\". Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I have misapplied the equations.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a different definition of \"rate of gas ejection\". For example, maybe it refers to the rate of gas ejection in terms of volume, assuming constant density? But the problem doesn't mention anything about volume or density.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in error and actually wants us to find the rate of gas ejection (which would be constant) given the acceleration. But the problem says the rate of gas ejection is constant and asks for the rate of change of the rocket's mass.\n\nWait, but if we take the equation:\n\ndm/dt = - [m g (n + 1)] / u\n\nThis is a differential equation. Let's write it as:\n\ndm/dt = -k m, where k = g (n + 1)/u\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, whose solution is m(t) = m₀ e^{-k t} = m₀ e^{- [g (n + 1)/u] t}\n\nTherefore, the mass decreases exponentially. However, the problem says that the rate of gas ejection is constant. But the rate of gas ejection is -dm/dt = k m(t), which is not constant unless m(t) is constant. Therefore, there is a contradiction. Hence, if the rocket is to have constant acceleration, the rate of gas ejection cannot be constant, unless the mass is constant. Therefore, the problem seems contradictory. \n\nBut since the problem is given, perhaps I need to reinterpret it. Maybe \"rate of gas ejection is constant\" refers to the fact that the exhaust velocity is constant? But exhaust velocity being constant is usually assumed in rocket problems. Or maybe the problem is referring to the fact that the thrust is constant? If the thrust is constant, then T = constant. From T - m g = m a, if T is constant and a is constant, then m must be constant. Again, contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the gravitational acceleration is negligible? But no, it says uniform gravitational field.\n\nWait, let me check if the question is from a textbook or standard problem. Sometimes, in some references, the rocket equation is derived assuming that the mass ejection rate is constant, and then the acceleration is derived from that. But here it's the reverse. Maybe the question is expecting us to write dm/dt = - [m g (n + 1)] / u, even though it's not constant, and maybe they just want that expression in terms of m? But the problem says \"find the rate of change of the rocket's mass,\" which is dm/dt, and if they accept that it's proportional to m, then that's the answer. But the problem also says that the rate of gas ejection is constant, which conflicts with dm/dt being proportional to m.\n\nWait, unless \"rate of gas ejection\" refers to the mass flow rate per unit thrust or something else. But no, standard terminology is mass flow rate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a misunderstanding in the term \"constant acceleration\". Maybe the rocket is not having a constant acceleration in the inertial frame, but in some other frame? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in error and actually wants us to assume that the acceleration is n times g relative to the Earth, but considering that the effective gravity is different? No, it says uniform gravitational field.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the gravitational acceleration is negligible compared to the acceleration provided by the rocket? But then if g is negligible, then dm/dt ≈ - m a / u, which would still be proportional to m.\n\nWait, let's try assuming that the problem wants us to ignore gravity? If we set g = 0, then dm/dt = - m a / u. Still proportional to m. Not constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in error and the \"rate of gas ejection\" is supposed to mean something else, like the specific impulse or something else. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that the problem is presented as solvable, and given that the derived equation dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u is dimensionally correct and follows from the physics, even though it conflicts with the statement that the rate of gas ejection is constant, perhaps the problem is using \"rate of gas ejection\" to mean the rate in terms of the mass flow rate per unit thrust or something else, or maybe there's a translation issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rocket's acceleration is n g in addition to overcoming gravity, so that the total acceleration is n g, meaning that the net acceleration after gravity is n g. Wait, that's what we already considered. \n\nGiven that I have to provide an answer, and given that the derived expression dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u is the only one that follows from the physics, even though it conflicts with the rate of gas ejection being constant, I think that perhaps the problem assumes that \"rate of gas ejection is constant\" is a red herring, or maybe it's a mistranslation, and they actually want us to derive dm/dt under the condition of constant acceleration, which would be the expression I found. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the rate of gas ejection is constant in the sense that the exhaust velocity times the mass flow rate is constant? No, that would be thrust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in error and the correct answer is dm/dt = - [ (n + 1) g / u ] m, which is what we derived, and the statement about the rate of gas ejection being constant is either redundant or incorrectly stated.\n\nSince the problem asks to find the rate of change of the rocket's mass, and given the conditions, the only possible answer is dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u. Therefore, I think that's what is expected, despite the conflict with the rate of gas ejection being constant. Perhaps in the problem's context, \"rate of gas ejection is constant\" is meant to indicate that the engine is operating at a constant throttle, which would mean that the thrust is constant. But if the thrust is constant, then T - m g = m a => T = m (a + g). If T is constant and a is constant, then m must decrease over time, which would mean that dm/dt is not constant. Therefore, even if the problem says the rate of gas ejection is constant (i.e., thrust is constant), the rate of change of mass would still be dm/dt = - T / u, since T = u * (dm/dt)_ejected = -u dm/dt. Wait, if T is constant, then dm/dt = - T / u, which is constant! Wait, this is a different approach. Let me think.\n\nIf the thrust T is constant, then from T - m g = m a, we have T = m (a + g). Also, since T = -u dm/dt, then:\n\n-u dm/dt = m (a + g)\n\nTherefore:\n\ndm/dt = - [m (a + g)] / u\n\nBut if T is constant, then -u dm/dt = T => dm/dt = - T / u, which is constant. Therefore, there is a contradiction here unless m (a + g) is constant. But if dm/dt is constant, then m(t) = m₀ + dm/dt * t. If a is constant, then m (a + g) can only be constant if dm/dt = 0, which is only possible if T = 0. Contradiction again.\n\nWait, this seems like a contradiction between two equations:\n\nFrom T = -u dm/dt => dm/dt = - T / u (constant)\n\nFrom T = m (a + g) => dm/dt = - [m (a + g)] / u\n\nTherefore, combining these two:\n\n- T / u = - [m (a + g)] / u => T = m (a + g)\n\nBut if T is constant and a is constant, this implies that m must be constant, which implies dm/dt = 0, which implies T = 0, which is a contradiction unless T = 0 and a = -g, which is trivial.\n\nThis suggests that it is impossible for both the thrust to be constant, the acceleration to be constant, and the mass to be changing. Hence, the only way this problem makes sense is if we drop the assumption that the thrust is constant, and instead assume that the acceleration is constant, and find dm/dt, which gives us dm/dt proportional to m, as before. Therefore, the statement about the rate of gas ejection being constant must be incorrect or misinterpreted. Given that, and since the problem asks to find dm/dt, I think the expected answer is dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u.\n\nBut since the problem mentions that the rate of gas ejection is constant, perhaps it's a different approach. Let me try one more time.\n\nSuppose that the rate of gas ejection (mass flow rate) is constant: let's call it k = -dm/dt > 0. Then, from the equation:\n\nT - m g = m a => k u - m g = m a => k u = m (a + g)\n\nTherefore, m = k u / (a + g)\n\nBut if k, u, a are constant, then m is constant, which implies dm/dt = 0, contradicting k = -dm/dt > 0. Hence, no solution.\n\nThis shows that the problem's conditions are contradictory. However, since the problem is given, and assuming that there is a solution, perhaps the error is in assuming that a = n g is the net acceleration. Maybe the problem means that the rocket's engines provide an acceleration of n g, and the net acceleration is different? No, the problem says the rocket ascends with a constant acceleration of n g.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in a non-inertial frame? For example, if the rocket is accelerating at n g, then in its own frame, there is a pseudo-force. But that complicates things unnecessarily.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the gravitational acceleration is negligible? If we set g = 0, then dm/dt = - m a / u, which is still proportional to m, not constant. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem has conflicting conditions, but the only mathematically consistent answer given the acceleration is constant is dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u. Perhaps the mention of the rate of gas ejection being constant is either a distractor or a mistake. Since the problem asks to find the rate of change of the rocket's mass, and given that, this is the only possible answer, I will go with this.\n\nTherefore, the rate of change of the rocket's mass is dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u. However, the problem does not provide the exhaust velocity u, so maybe we are supposed to express it in terms of other variables? Wait, but the problem doesn't give any other information. It says to find the rate of change of the rocket's mass, and the answer would be in terms of m, g, n, and u. But since u is not given, perhaps there is another way?\n\nWait, no, the problem might expect us to express it in terms of the thrust or something else, but since we don't have that information, perhaps we need to leave it in terms of u. However, in standard rocket problems, the exhaust velocity is a constant parameter, so maybe it's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says \"find the rate of change of the rocket's mass,\" so unless there is more information, this is as far as we can go. Therefore, the answer is dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach where dm/dt is constant. Suppose we are to find dm/dt, given that it's constant, and the rocket has a constant acceleration. As shown earlier, this is impossible unless m is constant, which it isn't. Therefore, no solution. Hence, the problem must expect us to derive dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u, disregarding the conflicting statement about the rate of gas ejection being constant. Perhaps the problem meant to say that the thrust is constant, but even then, as shown, it leads to contradictions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the rocket's acceleration is n g relative to the Earth, and that the gravitational acceleration is also acting, but with the mass change being small enough to neglect in the dm/dt term? But that would be an approximation, and the problem says to assume the rate of gas ejection is constant.\n\nGiven all this confusion, and since the derived expression dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u is dimensionally correct and follows from the physics, I think this is the answer expected, despite the conflict with the rate of gas ejection being constant. Perhaps the mention of the rate of gas ejection being constant is just to specify that we are to consider the mass change due to ejection, and not some other process, and that we should assume that the ejection is happening at a rate that maintains the constant acceleration, which would require dm/dt to vary.\n\nTherefore, I will conclude that the rate of change of the rocket's mass is dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u.\n\nBut the problem says to \"find the rate of change of the rocket's mass,\" and if they want it expressed as a positive number (magnitude), it would be |dm/dt| = m g (n + 1)/u. But since they might want the answer with the negative sign indicating mass loss, I'll include it.\n\nHowever, since the problem mentions the rate of gas ejection is constant, and if we denote the rate of gas ejection as λ = -dm/dt, then from our equation:\n\nλ = m g (n + 1)/u\n\nBut since λ is constant, this implies that m(t) = m₀ e^{(λ u)/[g(n + 1)] t}, which is exponential growth, which is unphysical for a rocket losing mass. Wait, no:\n\nWait, from dm/dt = -k m, where k = g(n + 1)/u, the solution is m(t) = m₀ e^{-kt}, which is exponential decay, as expected. Therefore, λ = -dm/dt = k m(t) = [g(n + 1)/u] m(t). This shows that λ is not constant, but decreases as the mass decreases. Therefore, the problem's statement that the rate of gas ejection is constant is incorrect, unless they define it differently.\n\nGiven all this, I think the problem has a mistake, but the answer they expect is dm/dt = - m g (n + 1)/u.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe rate of change of the rocket's mass is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{(n + 1) m g}{u}}.\n</think>"}
