So, the problem is about the decay of a single atom. We know that the probability of it decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. Now, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed yet, and we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A:40%, B:48%, C:52%, D:44%. \n\nHmm, first, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. That means the probability of decay over time is memoryless. Wait, what does that mean exactly? It means that the probability of the atom decaying in the next time interval doesn't depend on how long it has already survived. So, even if it's been 50 minutes without decaying, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes should be the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes. But wait, the given probability is for 100 minutes, not 150. So maybe I need to relate the 100-minute probability to the 150-minute one?\n\nLet me recall the formula for exponential decay. The probability that a nucleus decays after time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Alternatively, the probability that it hasn't decayed yet is e^(-λt). \n\nGiven that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, that means P(100) = 0.32. Therefore, the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. \n\nLet me write that down:\n\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nTo find λ, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-λ * 100 = ln(0.68)\n\nSo, λ = -ln(0.68)/100\n\nCalculating ln(0.68)... Let me approximate that. I know that ln(1) = 0, ln(0.5) ≈ -0.693, ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567. Let me check with a calculator. Wait, I can't use a calculator, but maybe I can remember that ln(0.68) is roughly... Let's think. Since 0.68 is between 0.7 and 0.6. Let me recall that ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3856. Let me check that. For example, ln(0.69) ≈ -0.3711, ln(0.68) is a bit more negative. Let me approximate it as approximately -0.385. Let me confirm with a Taylor series or some known values. Alternatively, maybe I can use the exact value later. But for now, let's proceed with λ ≈ -(-0.385)/100 = 0.00385 per minute. Wait, but maybe I should be more precise here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can keep it symbolic for now. Let's see. The problem is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this should be the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from the start. Wait, but the memoryless property says that P(T > s + t | T > s) = P(T > t). Therefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it has already survived 50 minutes is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from the start. So, the answer would be P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). \n\nBut we don't know λ yet. But we can calculate it from the given 32% decay probability at 100 minutes. Let's do that.\n\nSo, starting again:\n\nGiven P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100) => e^(-λ*100) = 0.68\n\nTake natural logs:\n\n-λ*100 = ln(0.68)\n\nSo, λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ ?\n\nLet me calculate ln(0.68). Let me recall that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856. Let me check with a more accurate method. Let's use the Taylor series expansion for ln(x) around x=1. But maybe it's easier to remember that ln(2) ≈ 0.693, ln(3)≈1.0986, etc. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that e^(-0.385) ≈ 0.68? Let me check. e^(-0.385) ≈ e^(-0.3) * e^(-0.085) ≈ 0.7408 * 0.92 (approx) ≈ 0.7408 * 0.92 ≈ 0.6815. Yes, that's very close to 0.68. So, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385. Therefore, λ ≈ 0.385 / 100 ≈ 0.00385 per minute.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. As per the memoryless property, since 50 minutes have already passed, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from the start. So:\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.00385 * 150)\n\nCalculate the exponent: 0.00385 * 150 = 0.5775\n\nSo, e^(-0.5775). Let me compute that. Again, e^(-0.5775) ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, e^(-0.6) ≈ 0.5488. Let's see. Let me approximate 0.5775 as approximately 0.5772, which is close to ln(2)/1. So wait, ln(2) ≈ 0.693, so 0.5775 is less than that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the Taylor series or remember that e^(-x) ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x³/6 + ... but maybe that's too tedious. Alternatively, use the fact that 0.5775 is approximately 0.5772, which is 1/√3 ≈ 0.577. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me think.\n\nLet me recall that e^(-0.5775) can be written as 1 / e^(0.5775). Let me approximate e^0.5775. Let me break it down. e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.0775 is approximately 1 + 0.0775 + 0.0775²/2 + 0.0775³/6 ≈ 1 + 0.0775 + 0.0030 + 0.0003 ≈ 1.0808. So, e^0.5775 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.0775 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0808 ≈ Let's compute that. 1.6487 * 1.08 = 1.6487 * 1 + 1.6487 * 0.08 = 1.6487 + 0.1319 ≈ 1.7806. So, e^0.5775 ≈ 1.7806. Therefore, e^(-0.5775) ≈ 1 / 1.7806 ≈ 0.5616.\n\nTherefore, P(150) = 1 - 0.5616 ≈ 0.4384, which is approximately 43.84%. The closest option is D:44%. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the calculations correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the half-life concept. Let's see. But since we have a different probability given (32% in 100 minutes), maybe the half-life approach isn't directly helpful, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the decay follows an exponential distribution, and the probability of decay in time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Given that P(100) = 0.32, so e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Then, to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, it's 1 - e^(-λ*150). Let me express this in terms of the 100-minute probability. Let me write:\n\nLet me denote τ as the time. So, P(τ) = 1 - e^(-λτ). We have P(100) = 0.32. We need P(150). Let me note that:\n\nLet me take the ratio of the exponents. Since e^(-λ*150) = [e^(-λ*100)]^(150/100) * e^(-λ*(150-100))? Wait, no. Wait, e^(-λ*150) = e^(-λ*100) * e^(-λ*50). But since we know e^(-λ*100) = 0.68, so we need to find e^(-λ*50). Let me see. Let me denote that:\n\nLet me take the square root of e^(-λ*100) to get e^(-λ*50). Because e^(-λ*100) = [e^(-λ*50)]^2. Therefore, e^(-λ*50) = sqrt(0.68) ≈ sqrt(0.68). Let me calculate sqrt(0.68). 0.82 squared is 0.6724, 0.83 squared is 0.6889. So sqrt(0.68) is between 0.82 and 0.83. Let me approximate it. Let me use linear approximation between 0.82^2 = 0.6724 and 0.83^2 = 0.6889. The difference between 0.68 and 0.6724 is 0.0076. The total interval is 0.6889 - 0.6724 = 0.0165. So, 0.0076 / 0.0165 ≈ 0.46. So, sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.82 + 0.46*(0.01) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, e^(-λ*50) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, e^(-λ*150) = e^(-λ*100) * e^(-λ*50) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ Let's calculate that. 0.68 * 0.8246. Let me compute 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544, 0.68 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.68 * 0.02 = 0.0136 and 0.68 * 0.0046 ≈ 0.003128. So total ≈ 0.544 + 0.0136 + 0.003128 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, e^(-λ*150) ≈ 0.5607, so P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, which is approximately 43.93%, so again about 44%. Therefore, the answer is D:44%.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there's another way. Since the problem states that after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed, and we need the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. But due to the memoryless property, this is equivalent to the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the start. Therefore, the answer is indeed 1 - e^(-λ*150), which we calculated as approximately 44%. \n\nBut let me verify the calculation again. Let's go back to the first method where I approximated λ ≈ 0.00385 per minute. Then, λ*150 ≈ 0.00385 * 150 ≈ 0.5775. Then e^(-0.5775). Let me use more precise estimation. Let me recall that ln(2) ≈ 0.693, so 0.5775 is about 0.833 * ln(2). Therefore, e^(-0.5775) ≈ e^(-0.833 * ln 2) = 2^(-0.833) ≈ 2^(-5/6) ≈ 1 / 2^(5/6). Let me compute 2^(5/6). Since 2^(1/6) ≈ 1.122, so 2^(5/6) = 2^(1 - 1/6) = 2 / 2^(1/6) ≈ 2 / 1.122 ≈ 1.782. Therefore, e^(-0.5775) ≈ 1 / 1.782 ≈ 0.561, so 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439 or 43.9%, which again rounds to 44%. So, answer D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to do this without calculating λ. Let me think. Since we know that the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 0.68. Let me denote the probability of not decaying in t minutes as S(t) = e^(-λt). So, S(100) = 0.68. We need to find the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is 1 - S(150). But S(150) = [S(100)]^(150/100) if the decay is memoryless and follows an exponential distribution. Wait, no. Wait, S(t) = e^(-λt), so S(150) = [e^(-λ*100)]^(1.5) = [S(100)]^1.5. Therefore, S(150) = 0.68^1.5. Let me compute that. \n\nSo, 0.68^1.5 = sqrt(0.68^3). Let me calculate 0.68^3 first. 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624, then 0.4624 * 0.68 ≈ 0.4624 * 0.6 + 0.4624 * 0.08 = 0.27744 + 0.036992 ≈ 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, S(150) ≈ 0.5607, so P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, which is 43.93%, again leading to 44%. \n\nSo this method is more straightforward. Since S(t) = e^(-λt), and we can express S(150) as [S(100)]^(150/100) = [0.68]^(1.5). Therefore, the calculation is 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607, leading to 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393. Therefore, the answer is 44%, which is option D.\n\nThis seems to confirm the previous results. Therefore, the correct answer should be D:44%.\n</think>"}
