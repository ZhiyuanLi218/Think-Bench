The problem states that 0.0623 grams of a metal produces 28.3 mL of hydrogen gas at STP. Then, I need to find out the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid. The answer choices are A:98.6 g, B:493 g, C:24.7 g, D:49.3 g.\n\nFirst, let me recall what STP means. STP stands for Standard Temperature and Pressure, which is 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm pressure. At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. That's a key point here. So the volume of hydrogen gas produced can be converted to moles using this molar volume.\n\nThe volume of hydrogen gas given is 28.3 mL. Let me convert that to liters first. Since 1 L = 1000 mL, 28.3 mL is 0.0283 L. Then, moles of H2 gas = volume / molar volume at STP. So that would be 0.0283 L / 22.4 L/mol. Let me calculate that.\n\nLet me do the division: 0.0283 divided by 22.4. Let me approximate 22.4 as 22.4 for calculation. Let me see, 0.0283 / 22.4 ≈ 0.001263 moles of H2. Let me check that again. 22.4 times 0.001 is 0.0224 L, which is 22.4 mL. So 0.0283 L is a bit more than 0.001 moles. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.0283 / 22.4 = ?\n\nWell, 22.4 * 0.00126 = 0.028224 L, which is very close to 0.0283 L. So approximately 0.00126 moles of H2. So roughly 1.26 x 10^-3 moles.\n\nNow, the next step is to relate the moles of hydrogen gas produced to the moles of metal reacted. For that, I need the balanced chemical equation between the metal and HCl. However, the problem doesn't specify which metal it is, so I need to assume a general reaction.\n\nLet me think. Metals typically react with acids to produce hydrogen gas and a salt. The general reaction is:\n\nMetal + Hydrochloric acid → Metal chloride + Hydrogen gas.\n\nThe exact stoichiometry depends on the valency of the metal. For example, if the metal is monovalent (like Na), the reaction would be:\n\n2M + 2HCl → 2MCl + H2\n\nIf the metal is divalent (like Mg), the reaction would be:\n\nM + 2HCl → MCl2 + H2\n\nIf the metal is trivalent (like Al), the reaction would be:\n\n2M + 6HCl → 2MCl3 + 3H2\n\nSo depending on the valency, the stoichiometry changes. Since the problem doesn't specify the metal, I need to figure out the valency based on the given data.\n\nLet me denote the metal as M with a valency of n. The reaction would be:\n\nn M + n HCl → MCl_n + (n/2) H2 ?\n\nWait, maybe I should write the balanced equation properly. Let me think again.\n\nIf the metal is M with valency n, then the chloride would be MCl_n. The reaction would be:\n\nM + n HCl → MCl_n + (n/2) H2 ?\n\nWait, let me check for example, for Mg (valency 2):\n\nMg + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + H2\n\nYes, so for a divalent metal, the ratio is 1 mole of metal to 1 mole of H2.\n\nFor a trivalent metal like Al:\n\n2 Al + 6 HCl → 2 AlCl3 + 3 H2\n\nSo here, 2 moles of Al produce 3 moles of H2. So the ratio is 2:3, meaning 1 mole of Al produces 1.5 moles of H2.\n\nSimilarly, for a monovalent metal like Na:\n\n2 Na + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2\n\nSo 2 moles of Na produce 1 mole of H2. So 1 mole of Na produces 0.5 moles of H2.\n\nTherefore, in general, for a metal with valency n, the reaction would produce (n/2) moles of H2 per mole of metal. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of electrons transferred. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula:\n\nLet me denote the reaction as:\n\nM + x HCl → MCl_x + (x/2) H2 ?\n\nBut the stoichiometry depends on the valency. Let me think in terms of the reaction producing H2. Each H2 molecule requires 2 H+ ions to be reduced. Each H+ gains one electron. So for each H2 molecule, 2 electrons are required.\n\nThe metal is oxidized, so it loses electrons. If the metal has a valency of n, then each atom of metal loses n electrons. Therefore, the number of moles of H2 produced is related to the number of moles of metal by the equation:\n\nmoles of H2 = (moles of metal * n) / 2\n\nBecause each mole of metal provides n moles of electrons, and each mole of H2 requires 2 moles of electrons. Therefore:\n\nmoles of H2 = (n * moles of metal) / 2\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nmoles of metal = (2 * moles of H2) / n\n\nBut since we don't know n, we need to find n such that the calculated molar mass of the metal matches with the given data.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem asks for the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of HCl, maybe we can approach it differently.\n\nLet me think again. The problem says: \"the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is...\" So perhaps we need to find the molar ratio between the metal and HCl first.\n\nLet me denote the balanced equation again. Let's assume that the reaction is:\n\nM + n HCl → MCl_n + (n/2) H2\n\nSo for each mole of metal, n moles of HCl are consumed. Therefore, the ratio of moles of metal to moles of HCl is 1:n.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the moles of metal and moles of HCl involved, I can find n, and then determine the molar mass of the metal.\n\nBut how do I find the moles of HCl? Wait, perhaps not directly. Let me think.\n\nGiven that 0.0623 grams of metal produces a certain amount of H2, which we calculated as approximately 0.00126 moles. Let me use the exact value now. Let me recalculate the moles of H2 precisely.\n\nVolume of H2 is 28.3 mL = 0.0283 L. At STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L. So moles of H2 = 0.0283 / 22.4 = ?\n\nLet me compute 0.0283 divided by 22.4. Let me do this division:\n\n22.4 goes into 0.0283 how many times?\n\nFirst, 22.4 * 0.001 = 0.0224\n\nSubtract that from 0.0283: 0.0283 - 0.0224 = 0.0059\n\nNow, 22.4 * x = 0.0059\n\nx = 0.0059 / 22.4 ≈ 0.0002634\n\nSo total moles ≈ 0.001 + 0.0002634 ≈ 0.0012634 moles ≈ 0.001263 moles of H2.\n\nSo approximately 1.263 x 10^-3 moles of H2.\n\nNow, using the relation between moles of metal and moles of H2.\n\nEarlier, I had the equation:\n\nmoles of H2 = (n * moles of metal) / 2\n\nTherefore, moles of metal = (2 * moles of H2) / n\n\nBut we can also relate moles of metal to its mass. The molar mass of the metal (let's call it M) is mass / moles. So:\n\nM = mass of metal / moles of metal = 0.0623 g / [(2 * 1.263 x 10^-3) / n] = 0.0623 * n / (2 * 1.263 x 10^-3)\n\nLet me compute that denominator first: 2 * 1.263 x 10^-3 = 2.526 x 10^-3\n\nSo M = (0.0623 * n) / 0.002526 ≈ Let me compute 0.0623 / 0.002526 first.\n\n0.0623 / 0.002526 ≈ Let me divide numerator and denominator by 0.000001 to make it easier: 62300 / 252.6 ≈ Let me approximate.\n\nWell, 252.6 * 247 ≈ Let me see, 250 * 247 = 61,750. But 252.6 * x = 62,300. Let me compute 62300 / 252.6 ≈\n\nLet me divide 62300 by 252.6:\n\nFirst, 252.6 * 200 = 50,520\n\nSubtract that from 62,300: 62,300 - 50,520 = 11,780\n\nNow, 252.6 * 46 ≈ 252.6 * 40 = 10,104; 252.6 * 6 = 1,515.6 → total ≈ 11,619.6\n\nSo total is approximately 200 + 46 = 246. So approximately 246. So 0.0623 / 0.002526 ≈ 24.67\n\nTherefore, M ≈ 24.67 * n grams per mole.\n\nSo the molar mass of the metal is approximately 24.67 * n.\n\nNow, n is the valency of the metal. Let me consider possible valencies. Common valencies are 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet me check for n=1: M ≈ 24.67 * 1 = 24.67 g/mol. The closest metal with molar mass around 24.67 g/mol is magnesium (Mg), which has a molar mass of about 24.3 g/mol. That's very close. So if n=2? Wait, no, if n=1, then M ≈ 24.67. If n=2, then M ≈ 49.3 g/mol. Let me check for n=2.\n\nIf n=2, then M ≈ 24.67 * 2 = 49.3 g/mol. What metal has molar mass around 49.3? Let me think. Calcium is about 40.08 g/mol, Scandium is 44.96, Titanium is 47.87, Vanadium is 50.94. So 49.3 is between Titanium and Vanadium, but not a common metal. However, maybe it's a less common one? Alternatively, maybe n=1 and the metal is Mg. But wait, if n=1, then the molar mass is ~24.67, which is Mg. But Mg has a valency of 2. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, if the valency is 2, then n would be 2. Wait, earlier I had the formula M ≈ 24.67 * n. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation.\n\nLet me go back. The equation was:\n\nmoles of H2 = (n * moles of metal) / 2\n\nTherefore, moles of metal = (2 * moles of H2) / n\n\nThen, molar mass M = mass / moles of metal = 0.0623 g / [(2 * 1.263 x 10^-3) / n] = 0.0623 * n / (2 * 1.263 x 10^-3)\n\nWhich is 0.0623 / (2 * 1.263 x 10^-3) * n ≈ 0.0623 / 0.002526 * n ≈ 24.67 * n\n\nSo M = 24.67 * n g/mol.\n\nNow, if the metal has valency n, and M is its molar mass. For example, if the metal is Mg with valency 2, then M should be 24.3 g/mol. Let's check:\n\nIf M = 24.67 * n, then if n=1, M=24.67. If the actual M is 24.3, then n would be approximately 24.3 / 24.67 ≈ 0.985, which is close to 1. But Mg has valency 2. So perhaps my derivation is incorrect?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption about the relation between moles of H2 and moles of metal is wrong. Let me re-examine that.\n\nEarlier, I said that moles of H2 = (n * moles of metal)/2, based on the electron transfer. Let me verify with Mg as an example.\n\nFor Mg reacting with HCl:\n\nMg + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + H2\n\nSo 1 mole of Mg produces 1 mole of H2. Therefore, moles of H2 = moles of Mg. In this case, n (the stoichiometric coefficient for HCl) is 2, and the valency of Mg is 2.\n\nBut according to my previous equation, moles of H2 = (n * moles of metal)/2. If n=2 (for HCl), then moles of H2 = (2 * moles of metal)/2 = moles of metal. Which matches the Mg example. So that seems correct.\n\nSo if the metal is Mg, with valency 2 (so n=2 in the HCl stoichiometry), then the molar mass would be M = 24.67 * n = 24.67 * 2 = 49.3 g/mol. But the actual molar mass of Mg is 24.3 g/mol. So there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that perhaps my formula is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I confused n. Let me define variables more carefully.\n\nLet me denote the valency of the metal as z. Then, the reaction would be:\n\nM + z HCl → MCl_z + (z/2) H2\n\nTherefore, for each mole of metal, z moles of HCl are consumed, and z/2 moles of H2 are produced.\n\nTherefore, moles of H2 = (z/2) * moles of metal.\n\nTherefore, moles of metal = (2 / z) * moles of H2.\n\nThen, molar mass of metal M = mass / moles of metal = 0.0623 g / [(2 / z) * moles of H2] = 0.0623 * z / (2 * moles of H2)\n\nEarlier, I had moles of H2 ≈ 1.263 x 10^-3.\n\nSo M = 0.0623 * z / (2 * 1.263 x 10^-3) ≈ 0.0623 * z / 0.002526 ≈ 24.67 * z\n\nAh! So previously, I had M = 24.67 * n, but actually it's 24.67 * z, where z is the valency. Earlier, I was using n as the stoichiometric coefficient for HCl, which is equal to z. So if the valency is z, then the stoichiometric coefficient for HCl is z. So the formula is correct. Therefore, if the metal has valency z, then M ≈ 24.67 * z.\n\nSo if the metal is Mg with valency 2, then M should be 24.67 * 2 = 49.3 g/mol. But the actual molar mass of Mg is 24.3 g/mol. Therefore, this suggests that my calculation is incorrect. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Let me recalculate the value of 0.0623 / 0.002526.\n\nOriginal numbers:\n\nmass of metal = 0.0623 g\n\nmoles of H2 ≈ 0.001263 mol\n\nmoles of metal = (2 / z) * moles of H2\n\nTherefore, molar mass M = mass / moles = 0.0623 / [(2 / z) * 0.001263] = 0.0623 * z / (2 * 0.001263)\n\nLet me compute denominator: 2 * 0.001263 = 0.002526\n\nSo numerator is 0.0623 * z\n\nTherefore, M = (0.0623 / 0.002526) * z ≈ (24.67) * z\n\nSo if the metal is Mg (z=2), then M ≈ 24.67 * 2 = 49.3 g/mol. But Mg is actually 24.3 g/mol. Therefore, this suggests that either my calculation is wrong or the metal is not Mg. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the relation between moles of H2 and moles of metal.\n\nWait, let me check with Mg. Suppose the metal is Mg with molar mass 24.3 g/mol. Let's see what volume of H2 it would produce.\n\nIf 0.0623 g of Mg is used, then moles of Mg = 0.0623 / 24.3 ≈ 0.00256 moles.\n\nSince the reaction is 1 mole Mg → 1 mole H2, then moles of H2 = 0.00256 moles. Volume at STP is 0.00256 * 22.4 L = 0.0573 L = 57.3 mL. But the problem states that 28.3 mL of H2 is produced. That's about half the volume. Therefore, if the metal was Mg, we would expect about 57 mL of H2, but the problem says 28.3 mL. Therefore, the metal must produce half as much H2, which would mean that the moles of H2 is half. Therefore, perhaps the valency z is 1 instead of 2? Let me check.\n\nIf z=1, then M ≈ 24.67 * 1 = 24.67 g/mol. Let's take that as the molar mass. Suppose the metal has molar mass 24.67 g/mol and valency 1. Then, moles of metal = 0.0623 / 24.67 ≈ 0.002526 moles. Then, moles of H2 would be (z / 2) * moles of metal = (1 / 2) * 0.002526 ≈ 0.001263 moles, which matches the calculated value from the volume. Therefore, this suggests that the metal has a valency of 1 and a molar mass of ~24.67 g/mol. However, there is no common metal with molar mass ~24.67 and valency 1. Sodium has molar mass ~23 g/mol and valency 1. Let's check what volume of H2 would be produced if the metal was sodium.\n\nReaction for sodium:\n\n2 Na + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2\n\nSo 2 moles of Na produce 1 mole of H2. Therefore, moles of H2 = moles of Na / 2.\n\nIf the metal is Na with molar mass 23 g/mol, then moles of Na = 0.0623 / 23 ≈ 0.00271 moles. Then, moles of H2 = 0.00271 / 2 ≈ 0.001355 moles. Volume at STP is 0.001355 * 22.4 ≈ 0.0303 L = 30.3 mL. The problem states 28.3 mL. Close but not exact. Considering possible rounding in the problem's data, maybe it's sodium? However, the calculated molar mass here is 24.67 g/mol for z=1, which is between Na (23) and Mg (24.3). Wait, no, if z=1, then M=24.67. But if the actual metal is something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is something with valency 2 but a higher molar mass. Let me think. If z=2, then M=49.3 g/mol. Let me check what metal has molar mass ~49.3 g/mol. Let me check the periodic table. Titanium is about 47.87 g/mol, Vanadium is 50.94 g/mol. So 49.3 is between Ti and V. However, these are transition metals, and their common valencies are variable. For example, Ti can have +3 or +4, V can have +2, +3, +4, +5. But if the metal has a molar mass of ~49.3 g/mol and valency 2, then it would be in that range. However, there isn't a common metal with molar mass exactly 49.3. However, the answer choices include D:49.3 g. The question is asking for \"the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is...\" So let's think about that.\n\nWait, the question is not asking for the molar mass of the metal, but the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of HCl. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"A metal is reacted with HCl to produce hydrogen gas. If 0.0623 gram of metal produces 28.3 mL of hydrogen at STP, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is A:98.6 g B:493 g C:24.7 g D:49.3 g\"\n\nAh! So the question is not asking for the molar mass of the metal, but the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of HCl. So perhaps I need to approach it differently.\n\nLet me think. From the reaction equation, for a general metal M with valency z:\n\nM + z HCl → MCl_z + (z/2) H2\n\nSo, 1 mole of metal reacts with z moles of HCl. Therefore, the mass of the metal that reacts with 1 mole of HCl would be (molar mass of metal) / z.\n\nBecause if 1 mole of metal reacts with z moles of HCl, then to find the mass of metal that reacts with 1 mole of HCl, it's (1/z) * molar mass of metal.\n\nSo if I can find the molar mass of the metal divided by its valency, that will give me the mass of metal per mole of HCl.\n\nEarlier, we found that molar mass of the metal is approximately 24.67 * z. Therefore, molar mass / z = 24.67 g/mol. Which is one of the answer choices, C:24.7 g or D:49.3 g? Wait, 24.67 is close to 24.7 g, which is option C. But earlier when we thought of z=1, then molar mass is 24.67 g/mol, so mass per mole HCl is 24.67 / 1 = 24.67 g, which is option C. However, if z=2, then molar mass is 49.3 g/mol, so mass per mole HCl is 49.3 / 2 = 24.65 g, which is also approximately 24.7 g. Wait, so regardless of z=1 or z=2, the value is around 24.7 g? Wait, how?\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf the molar mass of the metal is M, and it reacts with z moles of HCl, then mass of metal per mole HCl is M / z.\n\nBut earlier, we found that M = 24.67 * z. Therefore, substituting:\n\nmass per mole HCl = (24.67 * z) / z = 24.67 g.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the valency z, the mass of metal that reacts with one mole of HCl is 24.67 g. Which is approximately 24.7 g, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive. How can it be independent of z? Because if M = 24.67 * z, then M/z is constant. Therefore, the answer is 24.7 g, option C.\n\nBut let me check with the example of sodium. If the metal is sodium (M=23 g/mol, z=1), then mass per mole HCl is 23 / 1 = 23 g. Which is close to 24.7 but not exact. However, in our calculation, we found that M = 24.67 * z, which would imply that for z=1, M=24.67. If the actual metal has M/z = 24.67, then regardless of z, the value is the same. Therefore, the answer is 24.7 g, option C.\n\nBut let me check with the numbers given in the problem. Let's do it step by step again.\n\nGiven:\n\nmass of metal = 0.0623 g\n\nvolume of H2 = 28.3 mL = 0.0283 L\n\nmoles of H2 = 0.0283 / 22.4 ≈ 0.001263 mol\n\nFrom the reaction:\n\nmoles of H2 = (z / 2) * moles of metal → moles of metal = (2 / z) * moles of H2\n\nTherefore, moles of metal = (2 / z) * 0.001263\n\nMolar mass of metal M = mass / moles = 0.0623 / [(2 / z) * 0.001263] = (0.0623 * z) / (2 * 0.001263) ≈ 24.67 * z\n\nTherefore, mass of metal per mole of HCl is M / z = 24.67 g.\n\nSo regardless of z, this value is 24.67 g. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 24.7 g, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, the answer choices are A:98.6 g B:493 g C:24.7 g D:49.3 g.\n\nTherefore, option C is 24.7 g, which matches our calculation. However, let me verify this with actual numbers.\n\nLet me calculate M/z more precisely.\n\nFirst, let me recalculate moles of H2 with exact numbers.\n\nVolume of H2 is 28.3 mL = 0.0283 L.\n\nAt STP, 1 mole = 22.4 L. So moles of H2 = 0.0283 / 22.4.\n\nLet me compute this division more accurately.\n\n22.4 * 0.00126 = 22.4 * 0.001 + 22.4 * 0.00026 = 0.0224 + 0.005824 = 0.028224 L\n\nWhich is very close to 0.0283 L. The difference is 0.0283 - 0.028224 = 0.000076 L.\n\nSo additional moles: 0.000076 / 22.4 ≈ 0.0000034 moles.\n\nTherefore, total moles ≈ 0.00126 + 0.0000034 ≈ 0.0012634 moles.\n\nSo moles of H2 ≈ 0.0012634 mol.\n\nThen, moles of metal = (2 / z) * 0.0012634.\n\nMolar mass M = 0.0623 / [(2 / z) * 0.0012634] = (0.0623 * z) / (2 * 0.0012634) ≈ (0.0623 / 0.0025268) * z ≈ let's calculate 0.0623 / 0.0025268.\n\nLet me compute this division:\n\n0.0623 / 0.0025268 ≈ Let me write this as 62.3 / 2.5268 ≈\n\nDividing 62.3 by 2.5268:\n\nFirst, 2.5268 * 24 = 60.6432\n\nSubtract that from 62.3: 62.3 - 60.6432 = 1.6568\n\nNow, 2.5268 * 0.656 ≈ 2.5268 * 0.6 = 1.5161; 2.5268 * 0.056 ≈ 0.1415 → total ≈ 1.5161 + 0.1415 ≈ 1.6576\n\nWhich is very close to 1.6568.\n\nTherefore, total is approximately 24.656.\n\nSo 0.0623 / 0.0025268 ≈ 24.656\n\nTherefore, M = 24.656 * z g/mol\n\nTherefore, mass of metal per mole HCl is M / z = 24.656 g ≈ 24.7 g. So option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C:24.7 g.\n\nBut let me check with another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me assume that the reaction is M + 2 HCl → MCl2 + H2 (for a divalent metal).\n\nThen, moles of H2 = moles of metal.\n\nFrom the problem, moles of H2 = 0.0283 / 22.4 ≈ 0.001263 mol.\n\nTherefore, moles of metal = 0.001263 mol.\n\nMolar mass of metal = 0.0623 g / 0.001263 mol ≈ 49.3 g/mol.\n\nThen, the mass of metal that reacts with 2 moles of HCl is 49.3 g. Therefore, mass of metal that reacts with 1 mole of HCl is 49.3 / 2 = 24.65 g ≈ 24.7 g. So again, option C.\n\nAlternatively, if the reaction is 2 M + 2 HCl → 2 MCl + H2 (for a monovalent metal), then moles of H2 = moles of metal / 2. So moles of metal = 2 * moles of H2 = 2 * 0.001263 = 0.002526 mol. Molar mass = 0.0623 / 0.002526 ≈ 24.67 g/mol. Then, mass of metal reacting with 2 moles of HCl is 24.67 g (since 2 moles of metal react with 2 moles of HCl?), no:\n\nWait, the reaction is 2 M + 2 HCl → 2 MCl + H2. So 2 moles of metal react with 2 moles of HCl. Therefore, 1 mole of metal reacts with 1 mole of HCl. Therefore, mass of metal per mole HCl is 24.67 g / 1 = 24.67 g, which is again option C.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the valency, the answer is 24.7 g. Hence, option C is correct.\n\nBut let me check the answer choices again. The options are A:98.6 g B:493 g C:24.7 g D:49.3 g.\n\nSo according to this, the answer is C. But let me check with the initial calculation where if the metal had a molar mass of 49.3 g/mol (option D), then the mass per mole of HCl would be 49.3 / 2 = 24.65 g, which is again option C. Therefore, whether the metal is monovalent or divalent, the answer is C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C:24.7 g.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possibility. Suppose the reaction produces 3 moles of H2 per 2 moles of metal (like with Al), then:\n\nReaction: 2 Al + 6 HCl → 2 AlCl3 + 3 H2\n\nSo moles of H2 = (3/2) * moles of metal.\n\nTherefore, moles of metal = (2/3) * moles of H2.\n\nThen, molar mass M = mass / moles = 0.0623 / [(2/3) * 0.001263] = 0.0623 * 3 / (2 * 0.001263) ≈ 0.1869 / 0.002526 ≈ 74 g/mol. Then, mass of metal per mole HCl would be M / 3 (since 2 moles of metal react with 6 moles of HCl → 1 mole of metal reacts with 3 moles of HCl). Therefore, mass per mole HCl is 74 / 3 ≈ 24.7 g. Again, same result. Therefore, regardless of the valency, the answer is 24.7 g. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C:24.7 g.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
