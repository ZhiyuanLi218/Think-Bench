Let me start by recalling what I know about acids and bases, pKa, and pH.\n\nThe question says that nitrous acid, HNO2, has a pKa of 3.3. The solution has a pH of 4.2. They want to know which concentration is higher between the conjugate acid/base pair. The options are about comparing [HNO2] and [NO2^-], or some other species. Let me make sure I remember the right concepts here.\n\nFirst, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation comes to mind. That's the one that relates pH, pKa, and the ratio of concentrations of the conjugate base and the weak acid. The equation is:\n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\nWhere HA is the weak acid, and A^- is its conjugate base.\n\nIn this case, the weak acid is HNO2, and its conjugate base is NO2^-.\n\nSo plugging in the values given: pH is 4.2 and pKa is 3.3.\n\nSo, 4.2 = 3.3 + log([NO2^-]/[HNO2])\n\nSubtracting 3.3 from both sides gives:\n\n0.9 = log([NO2^-]/[HNO2])\n\nTo get rid of the log, I need to take 10 to the power of both sides. So:\n\n10^0.9 = [NO2^-]/[HNO2]\n\nHmm, what's 10^0.9? Let me think. 10^0.9 is the same as 10^(9/10). I know that 10^0.5 is about 3.16, and 10^1 is 10. So 0.9 is closer to 1. Maybe around 7.94? Wait, actually, let me recall that 10^0.9 ≈ 7.94. Let me check with a calculator if I can. Wait, I can't use a calculator, but maybe I can approximate. Since 10^0.9 = e^(0.9 * ln10). But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, 10^0.9 = 10^1 * 10^(-0.1) ≈ 10 * 0.794 ≈ 7.94. Yeah, that's right. So approximately 7.94.\n\nSo [NO2^-]/[HNO2] ≈ 7.94. That means that the concentration of the conjugate base NO2^- is about 8 times higher than the concentration of the weak acid HNO2. Therefore, [NO2^-] > [HNO2]. So looking at the options, that's option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The question is about the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair. The conjugate acid would be HNO2, and the conjugate base is NO2^-.\n\nSince pH is higher than pKa, that means the solution is more basic than the pKa. When pH > pKa, the deprotonated form (conjugate base) is favored. So that would mean [A^-] > [HA], which is the same as [NO2^-] > [HNO2], so option B.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). So if pH > pKa, then log([base]/[acid]) is positive, meaning [base]/[acid] > 1, so [base] > [acid]. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be B.\n\nLooking at the options given: A is [HNO2] > [NO2^-], which would be if pH < pKa. Since pH is higher here, B is correct.\n\nOptions C and D mention H2NO2^+ and HNO2. Wait, what's H2NO2^+? Is that the conjugate acid of HNO2? Wait, HNO2 is nitrous acid. Its conjugate base is NO2^-. The conjugate acid would be... if you protonate HNO2 further. But nitrous acid is HNO2. If you add a proton, you get H2NO2^+? Is that a real species? I'm not sure. Maybe in some contexts, but typically, for HNO2, the dissociation is HNO2 ⇌ H+ + NO2^-.\n\nSo the conjugate acid-base pair here is HNO2 (acid) and NO2^- (base). The other options mention H2NO2^+ and HNO2. If H2NO2^+ is the conjugate acid of HNO2, then HNO2 would be the conjugate base of H2NO2^+. But I need to think if that's relevant here.\n\nBut the question says \"the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair found in solution\". Since the solution is of nitrous acid, HNO2, the main species would be HNO2 and NO2^-.\n\nThe other options C and D involve H2NO2^+. Unless there's some other equilibrium happening here. But nitrous acid is a monoprotic acid, right? It donates one proton. So the conjugate base is NO2^-. There isn't a H2NO2^+ unless you have some other process, like maybe in a different protonation state, but under normal conditions, nitrous acid doesn't act as a base to accept a proton to form H2NO2^+. Unless in a very acidic solution. But here the pH is 4.2, which is slightly acidic. Wait, but pKa is 3.3, so pH is higher than pKa, meaning it's deprotonated more. So HNO2 is losing protons to form NO2^-.\n\nSo the main conjugate pair is HNO2 and NO2^-.\n\nTherefore, options C and D are probably distractors. The question is about the conjugate acid/base pair of nitrous acid, which is HNO2 and NO2^-.\n\nSo the correct answer is B: [NO2^-] > [HNO2].\n\nLet me just check once again. If pH is higher than pKa, the deprotonated form is more prevalent. So yes, that's correct. So answer B.\n</think>"}
