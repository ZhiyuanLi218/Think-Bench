Hmm, let me think. First, maybe I should just try dividing 137 by 500 directly? But I don't remember how to do that off the top of my head. Let me recall how decimal expansions work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify the fraction first. 500 is 5 times 100, right? So 500 is 5 × 100. So if I can rewrite 137/500 as something over 100 or something over 10, that might make it easier to convert to a decimal. Let me try that.\n\nSince 500 is 5 × 100, I can divide 137 by 5 first and then divide by 100. Let me compute 137 divided by 5. 5 × 27 is 135, so 137 divided by 5 is 27.4. Then, dividing that by 100 would move the decimal point two places to the left. So 27.4 divided by 100 is 0.274. Therefore, 137/500 is 0.274. So the decimal expansion is 0.274. The digits after the decimal are 2, 7, 4. The last nonzero digit is 4. So is the answer 4? Wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert the denominator to a power of 10. Since 500 is 5 × 100, but 5 is not a power of 10. However, if I multiply numerator and denominator by 2, that would make the denominator 1000, right? Because 500 × 2 is 1000. Let me try that. Multiply numerator and denominator by 2: (137 × 2)/ (500 × 2) = 274 / 1000. Then 274 divided by 1000 is 0.274. Yep, same result. So again, the decimal is 0.274, so the last nonzero digit is 4. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me verify 137 divided by 500. Let me do the division step by step. \n\nFirst, 500 goes into 137 zero times. So we put a decimal point and add a zero, making it 1370. 500 goes into 1370 two times (since 2 × 500 is 1000). Subtract 1000 from 1370, we get 370. Bring down another zero, making it 3700. How many times does 500 go into 3700? 7 times because 7 × 500 is 3500. Subtract 3500 from 3700, we get 200. Bring down another zero, making it 2000. 500 goes into 2000 four times. 4 × 500 is 2000. Subtract that, we get zero. So putting it all together, the decimal is 0.274. So the digits after the decimal are 2, 7, 4, and then it terminates. Therefore, the last nonzero digit is 4. \n\nBut maybe there's another way to think about this? For example, using modular arithmetic or something? Let me try that approach to confirm. \n\nThe question is asking for the last nonzero digit in the decimal expansion. Since the decimal terminates, as we saw, because the denominator factors into 2^3 * 5^3 (since 500 is 5^3 * 2^2? Wait, 500 is 5^3 * 2^2? Let me check. 5^3 is 125, 125 × 4 is 500, and 4 is 2^2. So 500 is 2^2 × 5^3. Therefore, the number of decimal places is the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of the denominator. So since it's max(2, 3) = 3, so the decimal expansion will terminate after 3 decimal places. Therefore, 137/500 is a decimal with 3 decimal digits, which we already found as 0.274. Therefore, the last nonzero digit is 4. \n\nAlternatively, if the decimal didn't terminate, we would have to find the last nonzero digit before it starts repeating or something? But in this case, since it terminates, we just need to find the last digit before all zeros. \n\nBut let me think again. Suppose I didn't convert it to decimal directly. Suppose I wanted to compute it using modular arithmetic or something else. Maybe for more complicated fractions, but in this case, it's straightforward. Let me try another approach just for practice. \n\nLet me recall that to find the decimal expansion, you can use the fact that 1/500 is 0.002. Therefore, multiplying 137 × 0.002. Let me compute 137 × 0.002. 137 × 2 is 274, so 137 × 0.002 is 0.274. Yep, same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down 137/500 as 100/500 + 30/500 + 7/500. Which is 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.014. Adding those together: 0.2 + 0.06 is 0.26, plus 0.014 is 0.274. Same result again. \n\nSo all methods point to 0.274. Therefore, the last nonzero digit is 4. \n\nBut let me check once more with actual division. Let me write out the long division of 137 divided by 500. \n\nSo 500 | 137.000...\n\nSince 500 is larger than 137, we write it as 0. and proceed. \n\nFirst step: 500 into 1370 (137.0). 500 × 2 is 1000. Subtract 1000 from 1370, remainder 370. Bring down a 0: 3700. \n\n500 into 3700 is 7 times (500 × 7 = 3500). Subtract 3500 from 3700: 200. Bring down a 0: 2000. \n\n500 into 2000 is 4 times. Subtract 2000, remainder 0. \n\nSo the decimal is 0.274. So digits after decimal: 2, 7, 4. No more digits, since remainder is 0. Therefore, last nonzero digit is 4. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 4. \n\nBut just to make sure there isn't some trick here. The question says \"the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point\". Since the decimal terminates, there are no more digits after that 4, so the last nonzero digit is indeed 4. If the decimal didn't terminate and had trailing zeros, those wouldn't count because they are zeros, so the last nonzero would be before them. But in this case, there are no trailing zeros because it terminates at the 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe if there was a repeating decimal with some zeros in between? But no, 1/500 is terminating. \n\nAnother way to think: 137 divided by 500. Let me write it as multiplying numerator and denominator by something to get rid of decimals? Wait, but denominator is already integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe think in terms of fractions. 137/500. Let me see if this reduces. Let me check if 137 and 500 have common factors. 137 is a prime number? Let me check. 137: it's not even, not divisible by 3 (1+3+7=11, not divisible by 3). 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 7*19 is 133, 137-133=4, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*12 is 132, 11*13=143, too big. So yes, 137 is prime. Therefore, the fraction is reduced completely. Therefore, denominator is 500=2^2*5^3. As such, decimal terminates after max(2,3)=3 decimal places. Therefore, decimal expansion is finite with 3 digits. So as we saw, 0.274. \n\nTherefore, the last nonzero digit is 4. \n\nAlternatively, if someone tried to think in terms of modulo 10 or something? For example, trying to find the digit positions. But since we know it's terminating after 3 digits, maybe we can compute 137/500 * 10^3 mod 10. Since multiplying by 10^3 shifts the decimal three places, giving us 274, then taking mod 10 would give the last digit, which is 4. \n\nSo that's another way: compute (137 × 2^3 × 5^3 / 500) × 10^3? Wait, maybe not. Wait, since 1/500 is 1/(2^2*5^3). If we want to compute 137/500 as a decimal, multiplying numerator and denominator by 2^1 to make the denominator 10^3. Because denominator is 2^2*5^3, multiplying numerator and denominator by 2^1 gives denominator as 2^3*5^3=10^3. Therefore, numerator becomes 137*2=274. Therefore, 274/1000=0.274. Therefore, the decimal is 0.274. Therefore, last nonzero digit is 4. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer seems to be 4. \n\nI think I've verified this multiple times through different methods. Unless I made a consistent mistake in all methods, which is possible but unlikely, the answer should be 4. \n\nWait, just to check with actual decimal conversion. Let me do 137 divided by 500. Well, 500 is half of 1000. Therefore, 137 divided by 500 is half of 137 divided by 250. Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, 1/500 is 0.002, so multiplying by 137 gives 0.002*100=0.2, 0.002*30=0.06, 0.002*7=0.014. So 0.2+0.06=0.26+0.014=0.274. Yep. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use a calculator? But since I don't have a calculator here, but since all my manual calculations agree, I think it's safe. \n\nTherefore, I think confidently the last nonzero digit is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>"}
