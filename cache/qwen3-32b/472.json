This is a classic scenario in Kaluza-Klein theory, where the extra dimension leads to a discrete set of mass eigenstates due to the quantization of the momentum in that dimension.\n\n---\n\n### Quantization of Momentum in the Extra Dimension\n\nFor a particle moving in a compact dimension of radius $ R $, the momentum in that direction becomes quantized. The condition for a wavefunction to be single-valued around the compact dimension leads to:\n\n$$\np = \\frac{n}{R}, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nThis quantization arises from the requirement that the wavefunction is periodic in the extra dimension. The momentum $ p $ is therefore inversely proportional to the radius $ R $, and the possible values of $ p $ are spaced by $ 1/R $.\n\n---\n\n### Resulting Particle Mass Spectrum\n\nAssuming the particle is at rest in the usual 3+1 spacetime and the field is massless in 5D, the 4D mass of the particle is given by the magnitude of the quantized momentum in the extra dimension:\n\n$$\nm_n = \\frac{n}{R}\n$$\n\nThis means that the particle masses form a *tower* of states, with each mass level indexed by an integer $ n $. The spacing between consecutive mass levels is constant:\n\n$$\nm_{n+1} - m_n = \\frac{n+1}{R} - \\frac{n}{R} = \\frac{1}{R}\n$$\n\nThis constant spacing indicates a **linearly spaced** mass spectrum.\n\n---\n\n### Dependence on Radius $ R $\n\nSince $ m_n \\propto \\frac{1}{R} $, the mass of each particle in the tower is inversely proportional to the radius of the compact dimension.

The options are about whether the masses are linearly or quadratically spaced and proportional to 1/R or R. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that extra dimensions in physics, especially in theories like Kaluza-Klein theory, lead to quantized momentum in the extra dimension. Since the extra dimension is closed, like a circle, the momentum around the circle would be quantized. For a circle of radius R, the momentum in that direction would be quantized in units of 1/R, right? Because if you have a particle going around the circle, its momentum p must satisfy p * 2πR = nħ, where n is an integer. Assuming ħ is set to 1 for simplicity, then p = n/(R). Wait, but in natural units where ħ = c = 1, maybe it's p = n/(R) or something similar. \n\nThen, the total mass of the particle would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the momentum in the usual 3D space and the momentum in the extra dimension. So, if the particle is at rest in 3D space, then its total energy (mass) would come from the momentum in the extra dimension. So the mass squared would be (p)^2 + (other momenta)^2. But if we're considering the rest mass, maybe we're looking at the case where the particle isn't moving in the usual 3D space, so the mass is just from the compact dimension's momentum. So mass would be p_n = n/(R), where n is an integer. Therefore, the masses would be proportional to 1/R, and each subsequent mass would be a multiple of 1/R. That would mean the masses are linearly spaced because each next mass is previous plus 1/R. For example, n=0: 0, n=1: 1/R, n=2: 2/R, etc. So the spacing between each mass is constant (1/R), hence linearly spaced. Therefore, the answer would be C: Tower of linearly-spaced masses, proportional to 1/R.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a case where it's quadratic. If the extra dimension is not a circle but some other shape, maybe? But the question says it's a closed, space-like extra dimension. Typically, when people talk about compact extra dimensions, the simplest case is a circle. For a circle, the momentum is quantized as n/R, leading to masses proportional to n/R. So linear spacing. However, if the extra dimension was, say, a line segment with some boundary conditions, maybe the quantization would be different? For example, if it's a segment of length L, then the momentum might be quantized as nπ/L or something, but that's similar—still linear in n. Unless there's some other effect.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes when you have multiple extra dimensions, the masses can depend on combinations of momenta in different directions, but here it's a single extra dimension. So the mass would be sqrt( (mass in 4D)^2 + (p_extra)^2 ). But if the original particle is massless in 4D, then the mass is just p_extra. But if the original particle has a mass, then it's a combination. However, the question is about a quantum field extending into the extra dimension. Maybe we're assuming that the particle is purely from the momentum in the extra dimension? Or maybe the original 4D mass is zero? \n\nBut in Kaluza-Klein theory, the mass spectrum for a scalar field in 5D compactified on a circle would have masses m_n = sqrt( m_4^2 + (n/R)^2 ), where m_4 is the 4D mass. If the original 4D mass is zero, then m_n = n/R. So the masses are linear in n and proportional to 1/R. Hence, the spacing between consecutive masses is m_{n+1} - m_n = (n+1)/R - n/R = 1/R, which is constant. Therefore, linearly spaced. So the answer is C.\n\nBut let me think again about quadratic. If the mass was proportional to n², then the spacing between masses would be quadratic. But why would that happen? Maybe if the energy levels were quadratic in n? But in quantum mechanics, for example, the energy levels of a particle in a box are quadratic in the quantum number for lower dimensions. Wait, no: in a 1D box, energy levels are proportional to n² because E = p²/(2m), and p is quantized as nπħ/L. So E is proportional to n². But here, we are talking about momentum in the extra dimension contributing directly to the mass. So if the mass is proportional to p, which is proportional to n/R, then mass is linear in n. However, if the mass squared was proportional to n²/R², which it is, since m_n = n/R, then m_n² is proportional to n²/R². But the question is about the pattern of particle masses. So if you look at the mass values, they are linear in n, so the spacing between each mass level is the same (for large n, the spacing is constant). So linearly spaced. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: Tower of linearly-spaced masses, proportional to 1/R.\n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in assuming that the mass is just n/R. Suppose we have a 5D theory with coordinates x^M = (x^\\mu, y), where y is the compact dimension with radius R. The momentum in the y-direction is quantized as p_y = n/R. The 5D momentum is p_M = (p_\\mu, n/R). The 5D mass is zero (assuming a massless field), so the invariant interval is p_M p^M = 0 = p_\\mu p^\\mu - (n/R)^2. Therefore, p_\\mu p^\\mu = (n/R)^2. So the 4D mass is m_n = n/R. So yes, exactly, masses are linear in n and proportional to 1/R. So the answer is C.\n\nAnother angle: if the extra dimension was a circle, then the Kaluza-Klein modes are labeled by integer n, with mass m_n = |n|/R. So the spacing between each mode is 1/R. So linearly spaced. So the answer is C.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
