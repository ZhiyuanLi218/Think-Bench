This process has specific thermodynamic implications in terms of enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Enthalpy Change (ΔH)**\n\nMelting is an **endothermic** process. This means that the system absorbs heat from the surroundings. Energy is required to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold the solid together. As a result, the **enthalpy change is positive (ΔH > 0)**. This is a general rule for all melting processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Entropy Change (ΔS)**\n\nEntropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. In a solid, particles are arranged in a highly ordered structure, while in a liquid, they have more freedom to move around, resulting in greater disorder. Therefore, when a solid melts into a liquid, the **entropy of the system increases**, and the **entropy change is positive (ΔS > 0)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCombining these two thermodynamic observations:\n\n- **ΔH is positive** (endothermic)\n- **ΔS is positive** (increase in disorder)\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the entropy and enthalpy changes when a solid melts. Let me start by recalling what these terms mean. \n\nEnthalpy change, ΔH, is the heat absorbed or released during a process at constant pressure. Melting is a phase change from solid to liquid. I remember that melting requires energy because you have to break the intermolecular forces holding the solid together. So, when a solid melts, it absorbs heat, right? That means the enthalpy change should be positive because the system is taking in heat. So, endothermic process. So, positive ΔH.\n\nNow, entropy, ΔS, is a measure of disorder or randomness. Solids have a very ordered structure, while liquids are more disordered. So when a solid turns into a liquid, the entropy should increase. So, the entropy change should be positive as well. \n\nLet me check if I'm mixing things up. For example, when water melts (ice to liquid), it's definitely absorbing heat, so positive ΔH. And the entropy increases because the molecules in liquid water are more disordered than in ice. So that supports my initial thought. \n\nLooking at the options: A is positive enthalpy and positive entropy. B is both negative. C is negative entropy and positive enthalpy. D is negative enthalpy and positive entropy. \n\nWait, so if both ΔH and ΔS are positive, the answer should be A. But wait, sometimes I get confused with exothermic vs endothermic. Let me think again. Melting is endothermic because you need to add heat to melt something. So yes, positive ΔH. And entropy increases, so positive ΔS. So A is the answer. \n\nBut let me consider if there's any exception or something I'm missing. For example, some substances might have different behaviors? No, generally, melting (fusion) has positive ΔH and positive ΔS. Freezing would be the reverse, so negative ΔH and negative ΔS. \n\nSo yeah, the correct answer should be A. Positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change.\n</think>"}
