Finally, I have to find the product $ bc $. \n\nFirst, I remember that reflecting a graph over a line involves reflecting each point on the graph over that line. So, if I can find the reflection of a general point $ (x, y) $ on the hyperbola $ xy = 1 $ over the line $ y = 2x $, then I can derive the equation of the reflected curve $ C^* $.\n\nBut how do I reflect a point over the line $ y = 2x $? I think there's a formula for reflecting a point over a line. Let me recall. The formula for reflecting a point $ (a, b) $ over the line $ Ax + By + C = 0 $ is something like... Hmm. Maybe it's easier if I use coordinate transformations. Since the line $ y = 2x $ isn't horizontal or vertical, maybe I can rotate the coordinate system so that this line becomes one of the axes, perform the reflection, and then rotate back?\n\nYes, that seems like a feasible approach. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, let me find the angle of the line $ y = 2x $. The slope is 2, so the angle $ \\theta $ that this line makes with the positive x-axis satisfies $ \\tan \\theta = 2 $. Therefore, $ \\theta = \\arctan(2) $. \n\nTo rotate the coordinate system by $ -\\theta $, so that the line $ y = 2x $ becomes the new x-axis. Then reflecting over the new x-axis is straightforward, and then I can rotate back. \n\nLet me recall the rotation formulas. If we rotate a point $ (x, y) $ by an angle $ \\theta $, the new coordinates $ (x', y') $ are given by:\n\n$$\nx' = x \\cos \\theta + y \\sin \\theta\n$$\n$$\ny' = -x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nBut since I want to rotate the coordinate system by $ -\\theta $, which is equivalent to rotating the points by $ \\theta $, so maybe I need to use the inverse rotation. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose I want to rotate the coordinate system by $ \\theta $, such that the line $ y = 2x $ becomes the x'-axis. Then, to perform a reflection over the x'-axis, and then rotate back. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for reflection over a line. Let me check if there's a formula for reflecting a point over the line $ y = mx $. \n\nYes, there is. For a general line $ y = mx $, the reflection of a point $ (a, b) $ can be found using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{(1 - m^2)a + 2mb}{1 + m^2}, \\frac{2ma - (1 - m^2)b}{1 + m^2} \\right)\n$$\n\nI think that's the formula. Let me verify it. Suppose m = 0, so reflecting over the x-axis. Then the formula gives:\n\nx-coordinate: $ \\frac{(1 - 0)a + 0}{1 + 0} = a $, y-coordinate: $ \\frac{0 - (1 - 0)b}{1 + 0} = -b $. Which is correct. Similarly, for m approaching infinity (vertical line), but since m is 2 here, let me use this formula.\n\nSo, since our line is $ y = 2x $, m = 2. Therefore, the reflection of a point (a, b) over the line y = 2x is:\n\nx' = [(1 - m²)a + 2mb]/(1 + m²) = [(1 - 4)a + 4b]/(1 + 4) = [(-3a + 4b)]/5\n\ny' = [2ma - (1 - m²)b]/(1 + m²) = [4a - (-3)b]/5 = [4a + 3b]/5\n\nTherefore, the reflection of (a, b) over y = 2x is ( (-3a + 4b)/5 , (4a + 3b)/5 )\n\nTherefore, if (x, y) is a point on the original curve C: xy = 1, then its reflection (x', y') is given by:\n\nx' = (-3x + 4y)/5\n\ny' = (4x + 3y)/5\n\nBut since (x, y) lies on C, we have xy = 1. However, we need to find the equation of the reflected curve C*, which consists of all points (x', y') obtained by reflecting points (x, y) on C. Therefore, we need to express the relationship between x' and y' in terms of the original equation xy = 1.\n\nTo do this, we can express x and y in terms of x' and y', then substitute into xy = 1. So we need to solve for x and y in terms of x' and y'.\n\nSo, we have the system:\n\nx' = (-3x + 4y)/5  ...(1)\n\ny' = (4x + 3y)/5  ...(2)\n\nWe can solve equations (1) and (2) for x and y. Let me write them as:\n\n-3x + 4y = 5x' ...(1a)\n\n4x + 3y = 5y' ...(2a)\n\nSo, solving this system for x and y. Let me write it in matrix form:\n\n[ -3   4 ] [x]   = [5x']\n\n[  4   3 ] [y]     [5y']\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can invert the matrix. The determinant of the coefficient matrix is (-3)(3) - (4)(4) = -9 - 16 = -25. Therefore, the inverse matrix is (1/determinant) * [ 3   -4; -4  -3 ] multiplied by -1? Wait:\n\nThe inverse of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is 1/(ad - bc) * [d -b; -c a]. So here, the matrix is [ -3   4; 4   3 ], so inverse is 1/(-25) * [3   -4; -4  -3] ?\n\nWait:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\na = -3, b = 4, c = 4, d = 3\n\nDeterminant is ad - bc = (-3)(3) - (4)(4) = -9 - 16 = -25.\n\nInverse matrix is 1/determinant * [d, -b; -c, a] = 1/(-25) [3, -4; -4, -3] ?\n\nWait:\n\nWait, inverse is [d, -b; -c, a] over determinant. So:\n\nFirst entry: d = 3\n\nSecond entry: -b = -4\n\nThird entry: -c = -4\n\nFourth entry: a = -3\n\nTherefore, inverse matrix is [3, -4; -4, -3] divided by determinant, which is -25. Therefore:\n\n[ x ]   = (1/-25) [3, -4; -4, -3] [5x'; 5y']\n\nTherefore:\n\nx = (1/-25)(3*5x' -4*5y') = (1/-25)(15x' - 20y') = (-15x' + 20y')/25 = (-3x' + 4y')/5\n\nSimilarly,\n\ny = (1/-25)(-4*5x' -3*5y') = (1/-25)(-20x' -15y') = (20x' + 15y')/25 = (4x' + 3y')/5\n\nWait, but that seems interesting. So solving for x and y gives:\n\nx = (-3x' + 4y')/5\n\ny = (4x' + 3y')/5\n\nBut hold on, isn't this the inverse of the reflection? Wait, because if reflecting (x, y) gives (x', y'), then reflecting (x', y') should give back (x, y). But the reflection is its own inverse? Wait, no. Wait, reflection is an involution, meaning that reflecting twice gives back the original. Therefore, if reflecting (x, y) gives (x', y'), then reflecting (x', y') gives back (x, y). Therefore, the formulas for x and y in terms of x' and y' should be the same as the formulas for x' and y' in terms of x and y. Wait, but according to my calculation, solving for x and y gives:\n\nx = (-3x' + 4y')/5\n\ny = (4x' + 3y')/5\n\nWhich is the same as the original reflection formulas. Which makes sense because reflection is its own inverse. Therefore, if I want to express x and y in terms of x' and y', which are the coordinates of the reflected point, then yes, they are given by the same formula. \n\nTherefore, since (x, y) lies on the original curve xy = 1, substituting x and y in terms of x' and y' into this equation gives the equation for the reflected curve. \n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nx = (-3x' + 4y')/5\n\ny = (4x' + 3y')/5\n\nTherefore, their product is:\n\n[ (-3x' + 4y')/5 ] * [ (4x' + 3y')/5 ] = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 25:\n\n(-3x' + 4y')(4x' + 3y') = 25\n\nLet me expand the left-hand side:\n\nFirst multiply -3x' by 4x': -12x'^2\n\nThen -3x' * 3y': -9x'y'\n\nThen 4y' * 4x': +16x'y'\n\nThen 4y' * 3y': +12y'^2\n\nTherefore, combining terms:\n\n-12x'^2 + (-9x'y' + 16x'y') + 12y'^2 = -12x'^2 + 7x'y' + 12y'^2\n\nTherefore, equation is:\n\n-12x'^2 + 7x'y' + 12y'^2 = 25\n\nBut the problem states that the equation of C* should be written in the form 12x² + bxy + cy² + d = 0. So, if I rearrange the equation:\n\n-12x'^2 + 7x'y' + 12y'^2 - 25 = 0\n\nBut since x' and y' are just coordinates on the reflected curve, we can replace x' with x and y' with y for the equation of the curve. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n-12x² + 7xy + 12y² - 25 = 0\n\nBut the problem wants it in the form 12x² + bxy + cy² + d = 0. So if I multiply both sides by -1:\n\n12x² - 7xy - 12y² + 25 = 0\n\nBut this is 12x² + (-7)xy + (-12)y² + 25 = 0. Comparing with the desired form 12x² + bxy + cy² + d = 0, we have b = -7 and c = -12. Therefore, the product bc is (-7)*(-12) = 84. \n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check my calculations again because sometimes signs can be tricky. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n(-3x' + 4y')(4x' + 3y') = 25\n\nExpanding:\n\nFirst term: -3x' * 4x' = -12x'^2\n\nSecond term: -3x' * 3y' = -9x'y'\n\nThird term: 4y' * 4x' = 16x'y'\n\nFourth term: 4y' * 3y' = 12y'^2\n\nAdding them up: -12x'^2 -9x'y' +16x'y' +12y'^2 = -12x'^2 +7x'y' +12y'^2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen equation: -12x'^2 +7x'y' +12y'^2 -25 = 0. Multiply by -1: 12x'^2 -7x'y' -12y'^2 +25 = 0. Therefore, if we replace x' and y' with x and y (since they are just variables), then the equation is 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0. Therefore, comparing with the given form 12x² + bxy + cy² + d = 0, we have b = -7 and c = -12. Therefore, bc = (-7)*(-12) = 84. \n\nBut let me check if there's a mistake here. The problem says \"the equation of C* be written in the form 12x² + bxy + cy² + d = 0\". So in my case, the equation is 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0. Therefore, yes, b is -7, c is -12. So bc = (-7)(-12) = 84. Therefore, the answer is 84. \n\nBut let me verify this with another approach to make sure. Maybe by actually reflecting a point and seeing if it satisfies the equation.\n\nTake a point on the original hyperbola, say (1,1). Wait, but (1)(1) = 1, so yes, it's on the hyperbola. Let's find its reflection over y=2x. Using the formula:\n\nx' = (-3*1 + 4*1)/5 = (-3 + 4)/5 = 1/5\n\ny' = (4*1 + 3*1)/5 = 7/5\n\nSo the reflected point is (1/5, 7/5). Let's plug this into the equation -12x² +7xy +12y² -25 = 0:\n\nLeft-hand side:\n\n-12*(1/5)^2 +7*(1/5)*(7/5) +12*(7/5)^2 -25\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n-12*(1/25) = -12/25\n\n7*(7/25) = 49/25\n\n12*(49/25) = 588/25\n\nSo total:\n\n-12/25 + 49/25 + 588/25 -25 = ( (-12 + 49 + 588 ) /25 ) -25 = (625/25) -25 = 25 -25 = 0. Perfect, it satisfies the equation. \n\nNow check if plugging into 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0:\n\n12*(1/5)^2 -7*(1/5)*(7/5) -12*(7/5)^2 +25\n\nCompute:\n\n12*(1/25) - 49/25 - 12*(49/25) +25\n\n= 12/25 -49/25 -588/25 +25\n\n= (12 -49 -588)/25 +25 = (-625)/25 +25 = -25 +25 = 0. Correct. \n\nAnother test point. Let's take (2, 1/2), since 2*(1/2) = 1. Reflect this point over y=2x. \n\nUsing the formula:\n\nx' = (-3*2 + 4*(1/2))/5 = (-6 + 2)/5 = (-4)/5 = -4/5\n\ny' = (4*2 + 3*(1/2))/5 = (8 + 3/2)/5 = (19/2)/5 = 19/10\n\nSo reflected point is (-4/5, 19/10). Let's plug into the equation 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0.\n\nCalculate:\n\n12*(-4/5)^2 -7*(-4/5)*(19/10) -12*(19/10)^2 +25\n\nFirst term: 12*(16/25) = 192/25\n\nSecond term: -7*(-4/5)*(19/10) = +7*(76/50) = 532/50 = 266/25\n\nThird term: -12*(361/100) = -4332/100 = -1083/25\n\nFourth term: +25 = 625/25\n\nAdding all together:\n\n192/25 + 266/25 -1083/25 +625/25 = (192 + 266 -1083 + 625)/25\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n192 + 266 = 458\n\n458 - 1083 = -625\n\n-625 + 625 = 0. Perfect. \n\nTherefore, the equation seems correct. Therefore, bc = (-7)*(-12) = 84. \n\nBut let me check once more if I have the right signs. The problem says the equation is 12x² + bxy + cy² + d = 0. In my case, the equation is 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0, so yes, b is -7 and c is -12, so bc is 84. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem? Let me think. For example, using the general equation of a hyperbola and reflecting it. But since we already have a working method with verified test points, I think this is solid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept that reflecting the hyperbola over a line will result in another hyperbola, and perhaps we can find its equation by knowing that it's a hyperbola with certain asymptotes. But since we already have the equation, maybe not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the original hyperbola and then reflect the parametrization. For example, parametrizing xy=1 as (t, 1/t), then reflecting each point (t, 1/t) over y=2x, getting expressions in terms of t, then eliminating t to find the equation. Let me try that as another check.\n\nLet me take a general point (t, 1/t). Reflect it over y=2x. Using the reflection formula:\n\nx' = (-3t + 4*(1/t))/5\n\ny' = (4t + 3*(1/t))/5\n\nSo x' = (-3t + 4/t)/5 and y' = (4t + 3/t)/5.\n\nLet me denote X = x' and Y = y'. So,\n\nX = (-3t + 4/t)/5\n\nY = (4t + 3/t)/5\n\nLet me try to eliminate t. Let me denote u = t + something? Maybe express equations for X and Y and find a relation between X and Y.\n\nLet me multiply numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nLet me denote t ≠ 0. Multiply X by 5t:\n\n5tX = -3t² + 4\n\nSimilarly, 5tY = 4t² + 3\n\nLet me write these equations:\n\n5tX = -3t² + 4 ...(3)\n\n5tY = 4t² + 3 ...(4)\n\nLet me solve equations (3) and (4) for t². From (3):\n\n-3t² = 5tX - 4 => t² = (4 - 5tX)/3\n\nFrom (4):\n\n4t² = 5tY - 3 => t² = (5tY - 3)/4\n\nTherefore, equate the two expressions for t²:\n\n(4 - 5tX)/3 = (5tY - 3)/4\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n4(4 - 5tX) = 3(5tY - 3)\n\n16 - 20tX = 15tY - 9\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\n16 + 9 -20tX -15tY = 0 => 25 - t(20X + 15Y) = 0 => t(20X + 15Y) = 25 => t = 25 / (20X + 15Y) = 25 / [5(4X + 3Y)] = 5 / (4X + 3Y)\n\nSo t = 5 / (4X + 3Y). Now, let me substitute this back into one of the equations for t². Let me take equation (3):\n\nFrom equation (3): 5tX = -3t² + 4 => substitute t:\n\n5*(5 / (4X + 3Y)) * X = -3*(25 / (4X + 3Y)^2) + 4\n\nMultiply both sides by (4X + 3Y)^2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5*5X*(4X + 3Y) = -3*25 + 4*(4X + 3Y)^2\n\nCompute left-hand side: 25X(4X + 3Y)\n\nRight-hand side: -75 + 4*(16X² + 24XY + 9Y²) = -75 + 64X² + 96XY + 36Y²\n\nTherefore, equation:\n\n25X(4X + 3Y) = -75 + 64X² + 96XY + 36Y²\n\nCompute left-hand side: 100X² + 75XY\n\nTherefore:\n\n100X² + 75XY = -75 + 64X² + 96XY + 36Y²\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\n100X² +75XY -64X² -96XY -36Y² +75 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(100X² -64X²) + (75XY -96XY) -36Y² +75 = 0 => 36X² -21XY -36Y² +75 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n12X² -7XY -12Y² +25 = 0\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. Therefore, replacing X and Y with x and y, we get 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0. Therefore, confirming the previous result. Therefore, bc = (-7)*(-12) = 84. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 84. \n\nBut just to ensure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the algebra during this parametrization approach. Let me check the key steps again.\n\nStarting from:\n\nAfter cross-multiplying:\n\n16 - 20tX = 15tY -9 => 25 = t(20X +15Y). Then t = 25/(20X +15Y). Then substituted into equation (3):\n\n5tX = -3t² +4. Then substituting t:\n\nLeft side: 5*(5/(4X + 3Y))*X = 25X/(4X + 3Y)\n\nRight side: -3*(25/(4X + 3Y))² +4\n\nMultiply both sides by (4X + 3Y)^2:\n\nLeft side: 25X*(4X + 3Y)*(4X + 3Y)/(4X + 3Y) )? Wait, no:\n\nWait, original equation after multiplying both sides by (4X + 3Y)^2:\n\nLeft side: 5tX * (4X + 3Y)^2 / (4X + 3Y) )? Wait, no, let me re-express.\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying both sides by (4X + 3Y)^2:\n\nLeft side: 5tX * (4X + 3Y)^2 / (4X + 3Y) ?\n\nWait no. Let me think again. If we have:\n\n5tX = -3t² + 4. Then multiplying both sides by (4X + 3Y)^2:\n\nLeft side: 5tX * (4X + 3Y)^2\n\nRight side: (-3t² + 4) * (4X + 3Y)^2\n\nBut since t = 5/(4X + 3Y), then t² = 25/(4X + 3Y)^2. Therefore:\n\nLeft side: 5*(5/(4X + 3Y))*X * (4X + 3Y)^2 = 5*5*X*(4X + 3Y)\n\nWhich is 25X*(4X + 3Y)\n\nRight side: [ -3*(25/(4X + 3Y)^2) + 4 ] * (4X + 3Y)^2 = -75 + 4*(4X + 3Y)^2. \n\nTherefore, yes, the equation becomes:\n\n25X*(4X + 3Y) = -75 + 4*(4X + 3Y)^2\n\nExpanding:\n\nLeft side: 100X² +75XY\n\nRight side: -75 + 4*(16X² + 24XY + 9Y²) = -75 + 64X² + 96XY + 36Y²\n\nBringing everything to the left:\n\n100X² +75XY - (-75 + 64X² + 96XY + 36Y²) = 100X² +75XY +75 -64X² -96XY -36Y² = 36X² -21XY -36Y² +75 = 0. \n\nDivide by 3: 12X² -7XY -12Y² +25 = 0. Correct. \n\nTherefore, this confirms again the equation. Therefore, bc = 84. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think geometrically. The original hyperbola xy=1 has asymptotes x-axis and y-axis. After reflecting over y=2x, the asymptotes should also be reflected. The reflected hyperbola should have asymptotes which are reflections of x-axis and y-axis over y=2x. Maybe this can help check the equation?\n\nLet me find the asymptotes of C*. The original asymptotes are x=0 and y=0. Reflecting x=0 (the y-axis) over y=2x. How?\n\nTo reflect the line x=0 over y=2x. Let me find the reflection of the line x=0 over the line y=2x.\n\nSimilarly for y=0. \n\nFirst, reflecting x=0 over y=2x. \n\nThe line x=0 is the y-axis. To find its reflection over y=2x. \n\nThe reflection of a line over another line can be found by reflecting two points on the line and then finding the equation of the reflected line. \n\nTake two points on x=0: (0,0) and (0,1). Reflecting (0,0) over y=2x is still (0,0). Reflecting (0,1):\n\nUsing the reflection formula:\n\nx' = (-3*0 + 4*1)/5 = 4/5\n\ny' = (4*0 + 3*1)/5 = 3/5\n\nTherefore, the reflected line passes through (0,0) and (4/5, 3/5). Therefore, the slope is (3/5 - 0)/(4/5 - 0) = 3/4. Therefore, the reflected line is y = (3/4)x. \n\nSimilarly, reflecting y=0 (the x-axis) over y=2x. Take points (0,0) and (1, 0). Reflect (1, 0):\n\nx' = (-3*1 + 4*0)/5 = -3/5\n\ny' = (4*1 + 3*0)/5 = 4/5\n\nTherefore, reflected line passes through (0,0) and (-3/5, 4/5). The slope is (4/5 - 0)/(-3/5 - 0) = -4/3. Therefore, the reflected line is y = (-4/3)x. \n\nTherefore, the asymptotes of the reflected hyperbola C* are y = (3/4)x and y = (-4/3)x. \n\nTherefore, the equation of the hyperbola should have these asymptotes. Let me check if the equation 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0 has these asymptotes. \n\nTo find the asymptotes of the hyperbola given by 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0, we can set the constant term to zero: 12x² -7xy -12y² = 0. \n\nLet me factor this equation. Let me try to factor 12x² -7xy -12y². \n\nLooking for factors of (ax + by)(cx + dy) = 12x² -7xy -12y². \n\nMultiply out: acx² + (ad + bc)xy + bdy². \n\nSo, ac = 12, bd = -12, and ad + bc = -7. \n\nLooking for integers a, b, c, d. Let me try possible factorizations. \n\nPossible factors for 12: 3*4, 2*6, 12*1. Let me try 3x and 4x for the first terms. \n\nLet me suppose (3x + my)(4x + ny) = 12x² + (3n + 4m)xy + m n y². \n\nWe need m n = -12 and 3n + 4m = -7. \n\nLet me solve for m and n. \n\nLet me let m and n be integers. Let me try possible factor pairs of -12:\n\nm, n:\n\n( -3, 4 ), ( -4, 3 ), ( -2, 6 ), ( -6, 2 ), ( -1, 12 ), ( -12, 1 ), ( 3, -4 ), ( 4, -3 ), etc.\n\nCheck 3n + 4m:\n\nTake m = 3, n = -4: 3*(-4) + 4*(3) = -12 + 12 = 0 ≠ -7.\n\nm = 4, n = -3: 3*(-3) + 4*(4) = -9 + 16 = 7 ≠ -7.\n\nm = -3, n = 4: 3*4 + 4*(-3) = 12 -12 = 0.\n\nm = -4, n = 3: 3*3 + 4*(-4) = 9 -16 = -7. Bingo!\n\nYes! So m = -4, n = 3. Therefore, the equation factors as (3x -4y)(4x + 3y) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the asymptotes are 3x -4y = 0 => y = (3/4)x, and 4x + 3y = 0 => y = (-4/3)x. Which matches the asymptotes we found earlier! Therefore, this confirms that our equation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the equation of C* is indeed 12x² -7xy -12y² +25 = 0, so bc = (-7)*(-12) = 84. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 84. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{84}\n</think>"}
