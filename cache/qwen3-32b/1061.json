The problem says each plate has a sequence of five characters chosen from the letters in \"AIME\" and the digits in \"2007\". The key thing is that no character can appear more times than it does in AIME or 2007. Then, they want me to find N divided by 10, where N is the total number of such license plates.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The characters allowed are A, I, M, E, 2, 0, 0, 7. Wait, so letters A, I, M, E each appear once, and digits 2, 0, 0, 7. So the digits have two 0s and one each of 2 and 7. Therefore, when constructing sequences of five characters, we have to make sure that we don't use more than one A, I, M, or E, and no more than two 0s, and no more than one 2 or 7. \n\nSo the problem is similar to counting the number of 5-length strings with the given characters, considering their multiplicities. Then N is that number, and we need N divided by 10. \n\nSo how do I compute N? Well, normally, if there were no restrictions on repetition, it would be 8^5, since there are 8 distinct characters? Wait, but actually, the characters aren't all distinct. The original set is A, I, M, E, 2, 0, 0, 7. So there are 8 characters in total, but with duplicates for 0. However, when building sequences, we can't have more duplicates than allowed by the original set.\n\nTherefore, this is a permutation problem with multiset. Wait, but sequences allow for repetition, but with restrictions on how many times each element can be used. So it's like counting the number of 5-length strings where each character is from the multiset {A, I, M, E, 2, 0, 0, 7}.\n\nAlternatively, since we have limited quantities for each character:\n\n- A: 1\n- I: 1\n- M: 1\n- E: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 0: 2\n- 7: 1\n\nSo each license plate is a sequence of five characters, where:\n\n- A, I, M, E, 2, 7 can be used at most once each\n- 0 can be used at most twice.\n\nTherefore, to compute N, we need to count all such sequences. How do we do that?\n\nOne approach is to consider all possible combinations of characters that satisfy the constraints, and then for each combination, compute the number of permutations.\n\nBut since the sequences are of length 5, and the total number of characters available (if we had unlimited repetition) is 8, but with restrictions. However, given that we have limited numbers of each character, we need to consider different cases based on how many 0s are used, because 0 is the only character that can be used twice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as inclusion-exclusion? But that might get complicated. Alternatively, since the only restriction is on the number of 0s (which can be 0, 1, or 2), perhaps we can break it into cases based on the number of 0s in the sequence.\n\nYes, that seems manageable. Let me try that.\n\nCase 1: No 0s in the sequence.\n\nCase 2: Exactly one 0 in the sequence.\n\nCase 3: Exactly two 0s in the sequence.\n\nThese are the only possibilities since we can't have more than two 0s.\n\nFor each case, we can compute the number of sequences.\n\nStarting with Case 1: No 0s. Then all five characters are chosen from A, I, M, E, 2, 7. Each of these characters can be used at most once. However, there are 6 distinct characters (A, I, M, E, 2, 7). So, if we need sequences of length 5 with no repetition (since each character can only be used once here), the number of such sequences is the number of permutations of 6 characters taken 5 at a time, which is P(6,5) = 6*5*4*3*2 = 720.\n\nWait, let me check that formula. Permutation formula is n! / (n - k)! where n is 6 and k is 5. So 6! / 1! = 720 / 1 = 720. Yes, that's right.\n\nCase 1 contributes 720 sequences.\n\nCase 2: Exactly one 0. So, in this case, one of the five characters is 0, and the remaining four are chosen from A, I, M, E, 2, 7, with no repetition (since each can be used only once). Also, note that since we have only one 0, which is allowed here.\n\nSo, first, choose the position of the 0 in the five-character sequence. There are C(5,1) = 5 ways.\n\nThen, the remaining four characters are selected from the 6 non-zero characters (A, I, M, E, 2, 7), with no repetition. The number of ways to arrange them is P(6,4) = 6*5*4*3 = 360.\n\nTherefore, total for Case 2 is 5 * 360 = 1800.\n\nCase 3: Exactly two 0s. Now, two of the five characters are 0s, and the remaining three are selected from A, I, M, E, 2, 7, again with no repetition.\n\nFirst, choose the positions of the two 0s: C(5,2) = 10.\n\nThen, the remaining three characters are selected and arranged in the remaining three positions. The number of ways is P(6,3) = 6*5*4 = 120.\n\nThus, total for Case 3 is 10 * 120 = 1200.\n\nTherefore, total N = Case1 + Case2 + Case3 = 720 + 1800 + 1200 = Let's compute:\n\n720 + 1800 = 2520; 2520 + 1200 = 3720. Therefore N is 3720. Then N/10 is 372. So is the answer 372?\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nCase 1: P(6,5) = 720. Correct.\n\nCase 2: 5 positions for 0, then permutations of 4 from 6: 5 * P(6,4) = 5 * 360 = 1800. Correct.\n\nCase 3: C(5,2) = 10, then permutations of 3 from 6: 10 * 120 = 1200. Correct. Total N is 720 + 1800 + 1200 = 3720. Then N / 10 is 372. So the answer is 372?\n\nBut let me think again if there are any mistakes here. For example, are there any other constraints? The problem says \"no character may appear in a sequence more times than it appears among the four letters in AIME or the four digits in 2007\". So AIME has four letters, each appearing once, and 2007 has digits 2,0,0,7. Therefore, letters A, I, M, E can be used at most once each; digits 2, 0, 7 can be used at most once, twice, once respectively. So in our calculation, we considered 0 can be used up to two times, others up to once. So our cases for 0s are correct.\n\nBut let me check if there is any possibility of overcounting? For example, when we have sequences with two 0s, we are not using any other characters more than once. Since in Case 3, the other three characters are selected from A, I, M, E, 2, 7, each used once. So that's okay. Similarly in Case 2, only one 0, others unique.\n\nTherefore, seems okay.\n\nBut let me check another approach. Let me think of generating function. The exponential generating function? Or ordinary generating function?\n\nWait, for problems with limited repetitions, the ordinary generating function for each character is:\n\nFor each character, the generating function is 1 + x + x^2/2! + ... up to the maximum number of times it can be used. But since we are dealing with sequences (where order matters), maybe exponential generating functions?\n\nWait, actually, maybe not. Let me recall. For counting the number of sequences (permutations) with restricted numbers of each element, the formula can be calculated using multinomial coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to think of it as:\n\nTotal number of sequences is equal to the coefficient of x^5 in the generating function multiplied by 5! ?\n\nWait, maybe. Let me recall that for exponential generating functions, but perhaps it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each character, the generating function for the number of ways to use that character is:\n\nFor characters that can be used 0 or 1 times: (1 + x)\n\nFor the 0, which can be used 0, 1, or 2 times: (1 + x + x^2 / 2!) ?\n\nWait, no, if order matters, maybe not. Wait, actually, generating functions for permutations with restricted repetition is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nThe total number of sequences is the sum over all possible combinations of characters (with their multiplicities) of (number of permutations of that combination).\n\nWhich is exactly what we did with the cases.\n\nAlternatively, think of the generating function as:\n\nFor each element, the generating function is:\n\nFor A, I, M, E, 2, 7: 1 + x (since they can be used 0 or 1 times)\n\nFor 0: 1 + x + x^2 (since it can be used 0, 1, or 2 times)\n\nThen, the coefficient of x^k in the product of these generating functions will give the number of combinations (without considering order) for k elements. Then multiply by k! to get the number of sequences.\n\nWait, so for our problem, we need k=5. Therefore, compute the coefficient of x^5 in the product [(1 + x)^6 * (1 + x + x^2)] and then multiply by 5! ?\n\nWait, let me check that logic. If we have generating functions where each term is 1 + x for each element that can be used once, and 1 + x + x^2 for the element that can be used twice. Then, the coefficient of x^5 would represent the number of multisets of size 5, considering the restrictions. Then, since each multiset corresponds to 5! divided by the product of factorials of the counts of each element, but if we want to get the number of sequences (permutations), we need to multiply by 5! divided by ... Wait, maybe this approach is more complicated. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exponential generating function? For exponential generating functions, each element contributes 1 + x + x^2/2! + ... but again, with restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ordinary generating function for the number of sequences is:\n\nFor each character, the generating function is:\n\nFor characters that can be used once: 1 + x (since they can be included or not, and in sequences, their contribution is just 1 for presence)\n\nBut actually, no, generating functions for sequences where order matters... Hmm.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. Let me think of it as the product for each character of (1 + c*x + (c^2)/2! *x^2 + ... ), but no, perhaps not. Maybe I need to use the ordinary generating function where each character contributes (1 + x)^{number of times it can be used}?\n\nNo, that might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, since order matters, perhaps for each character, the generating function is 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^k, where k is the maximum number of times it can be used. Then, the coefficient of x^n in the product gives the number of sequences? Wait, no, because when you multiply generating functions like that, you are actually counting the number of multisets, not sequences. For sequences, order matters, so that approach would undercount.\n\nWait, perhaps another way. Suppose we think of each position in the sequence. But with restrictions on how many times each character is used. That seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since we already have a correct answer via case analysis, perhaps we can check with generating functions whether the total number is 3720.\n\nSo let's try. Let me compute the generating function as follows:\n\nFor each character, the generating function is:\n\nFor A, I, M, E, 2, 7: since they can be used 0 or 1 times, their generating functions are (1 + x). For 0, which can be used 0, 1, or 2 times, the generating function is (1 + x + x^2). Therefore, the total generating function is [(1 + x)^6] * (1 + x + x^2). \n\nIf we expand this, the coefficient of x^5 will give the number of combinations (i.e., multisets) of 5 characters considering the restrictions. Then, for each such multiset, the number of distinct sequences is 5! divided by the product of factorials of the counts of each repeated character. However, since generating functions here just count the number of combinations, we need another way to account for permutations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use exponential generating functions? Let me recall that exponential generating function for a set where each element can be used at most once is e^x, but with restrictions... Hmm, maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the total number of sequences as follows:\n\nFor each possible number of 0s (0, 1, 2), compute the number of sequences as we did before. Which is exactly what we did with cases. So maybe generating functions aren't necessary here.\n\nBut let me try to compute the generating function coefficient and see if it matches our previous result.\n\nSo first, compute [(1 + x)^6 * (1 + x + x^2)]. Let me compute the coefficient of x^5 in this product.\n\nFirst, expand (1 + x)^6:\n\n(1 + x)^6 = 1 + 6x + 15x^2 + 20x^3 + 15x^4 + 6x^5 + x^6.\n\nMultiply this by (1 + x + x^2):\n\nLet me denote A = (1 + 6x + 15x^2 + 20x^3 + 15x^4 + 6x^5 + x^6)\n\nMultiply by (1 + x + x^2):\n\nCoefficient of x^5 in A*(1 + x + x^2) is equal to:\n\nCoefficient of x^5 in A*1 + coefficient of x^5 in A*x + coefficient of x^5 in A*x^2.\n\nWhich is:\n\nCoeff(x^5 in A) + Coeff(x^4 in A) + Coeff(x^3 in A).\n\nFrom above, Coeff(x^5 in A) is 6.\n\nCoeff(x^4 in A) is 15.\n\nCoeff(x^3 in A) is 20.\n\nTherefore total coefficient is 6 + 15 + 20 = 41.\n\nTherefore, the number of multisets of size 5 is 41. Then, how does this relate to the number of sequences?\n\nEach multiset corresponds to some number of sequences, depending on duplicates. For example, if a multiset has no duplicates (except for 0, which can have up to two), then the number of sequences is 5! divided by the product of factorials of the counts of each element.\n\nTherefore, we need to calculate for each multiset, the number of distinct permutations, then sum them all up.\n\nBut how can we do that? Well, perhaps instead of just counting the number of multisets, we need to weight each multiset by the number of permutations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a generating function approach where instead of multiplying (1 + x + ...), we use exponential generating functions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the principle we used before. Since our original case analysis gave us 3720, let's check if 41 multiplied by something equals 3720. But 41 * 90 = 3690, 41 * 90.73... Hmm, not sure. Maybe this approach is more complicated. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the total number by considering each case of the number of 0s and then compute the permutations.\n\nWhich is exactly what we did in the first approach. For example, the coefficient 41 in the generating function corresponds to:\n\nNumber of multisets with 0 zeros: then we have 5 distinct characters from the 6 non-zero ones. The number of such multisets is C(6,5) = 6.\n\nNumber of multisets with 1 zero: then we have 1 zero and 4 distinct characters from the 6 non-zero ones. The number is C(6,4) = 15.\n\nNumber of multisets with 2 zeros: then we have 2 zeros and 3 distinct characters from the 6 non-zero ones. The number is C(6,3) = 20.\n\nTherefore, total multisets: 6 + 15 + 20 = 41, which matches the coefficient. Now, for each of these:\n\n- For the 6 multisets with 0 zeros: each has 5 distinct characters, so number of permutations is 5! = 120. Total for this part: 6 * 120 = 720. Which matches our Case 1.\n\n- For the 15 multisets with 1 zero: each has 1 zero and 4 distinct non-zero characters. The number of permutations is 5! / 1! (since only one duplicate? No, wait, no duplicates except for the zero? Wait, no, in the multiset, there is one zero and four unique characters. Therefore, the total number of permutations is 5! / 1! (but there is only one zero, so no division needed). Wait, if there is only one duplicate? No, no duplicates. The zero is only once. All other characters are unique. Therefore, the number of permutations is 5! = 120. Therefore total for this part: 15 * 120 = 1800. Which matches our Case 2.\n\n- For the 20 multisets with 2 zeros: each has two zeros and three unique non-zero characters. The number of permutations is 5! / 2! (because of the two zeros). So 120 / 2 = 60. Therefore total for this part is 20 * 60 = 1200. Which matches our Case 3.\n\nTherefore total N = 720 + 1800 + 1200 = 3720. Therefore N / 10 is 372. Therefore the answer is 372. \n\nTherefore, I think this is correct. However, let me check once more for possible mistakes. For example, is there a case where another character is repeated? For example, suppose someone tries to use two of a non-zero character? But according to our case analysis, we considered only sequences where non-zero characters are unique. Because in the multisets, we have C(6,5), C(6,4), C(6,3), which choose distinct characters. Therefore, in our calculation, we have already ensured that no non-zero character is repeated. Therefore, the constraints are satisfied. \n\nFor example, if we tried to use two A's, that would be invalid, but since in our generating function approach, we are only choosing each non-zero character at most once (because we are choosing subsets), that is already taken care of. Therefore, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think N is indeed 3720, so N / 10 is 372. Therefore, the answer is 372. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me do a smaller case. Let's say, instead of sequences of length 5, let's take sequences of length 1. Then N should be 7 (A, I, M, E, 2, 0, 7). Wait, original characters are A, I, M, E, 2, 0, 0, 7. So unique characters are A, I, M, E, 2, 0, 7. So 7 unique characters. For sequences of length 1, number of plates is 7. According to our formula:\n\nCase 1: 0 zeros: P(6,1) = 6\n\nCase 2: 1 zero: C(1,1)*P(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1? Wait, no, for sequences of length 1, with exactly one zero: it's just 1 sequence (\"0\"). So total N = 6 + 1 = 7. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, with our generating function approach:\n\nCoefficient of x^1 in [(1 + x)^6*(1 + x + x^2)] is:\n\nCoeff(x^1 in (1 + x)^6) + Coeff(x^0 in (1 + x)^6) * Coeff(x^1 in (1 + x + x^2))? Wait no, earlier approach was multiplying the polynomials. Wait, original generating function is [(1 + x)^6]*(1 + x + x^2). The coefficient of x^1 is:\n\nFrom (1 + x)^6, coefficients:\n\nAt x^0: 1, multiplied by x^1 from (1 + x + x^2): 1*1 = 1.\n\nAt x^1: 6, multiplied by x^0 from (1 + x + x^2): 6*1 = 6.\n\nTotal coefficient: 1 + 6 = 7. Then, since sequences of length 1, each multiset corresponds to 1! permutations. Therefore total N is 7*1! = 7, correct. So that works.\n\nAnother test case: sequences of length 2.\n\nUsing our case approach:\n\nCase 1: 0 zeros. Then sequences of length 2 from 6 characters, no repetition: P(6,2) = 6*5=30.\n\nCase 2: 1 zero. Then one zero and one other character. Number of sequences: 2 positions for zero, and 6 choices for the other character. So 2*6=12.\n\nCase 3: 2 zeros. But since we can have two zeros, sequences with two zeros. There is only 1 such sequence: \"00\".\n\nTotal N = 30 + 12 + 1 = 43.\n\nUsing generating function approach:\n\nCoefficient of x^2 in [(1 + x)^6*(1 + x + x^2)] is:\n\nCoeff(x^2 in (1 + x)^6) + Coeff(x^1 in (1 + x)^6) + Coeff(x^0 in (1 + x)^6)*Coeff(x^2 in (1 + x + x^2)) ?\n\nWait, no. Earlier, when we multiplied A*(1 + x + x^2), the coefficient of x^2 is:\n\nCoeff(x^2 in A) + Coeff(x^1 in A) + Coeff(x^0 in A). Wait, no, more accurately, when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of x^k is sum_{i=0}^k (Coeff(x^i in first poly) * Coeff(x^{k - i} in second poly)).\n\nBut here, the first poly is (1 + x)^6 and the second is (1 + x + x^2). Therefore, coefficient of x^2 is:\n\nCoeff(x^0 in (1 + x)^6)*Coeff(x^2 in (1 + x + x^2)) + Coeff(x^1 in (1 + x)^6)*Coeff(x^1 in (1 + x + x^2)) + Coeff(x^2 in (1 + x)^6)*Coeff(x^0 in (1 + x + x^2)).\n\nWhich is:\n\n1 * 1 (since Coeff(x^2 in second poly is 1) + 6 * 1 (Coeff(x^1 in first poly is 6, Coeff(x^1 in second poly is 1) + 15 * 1 (Coeff(x^2 in first poly is 15, Coeff(x^0 in second poly is 1). Therefore total is 1 + 6 + 15 = 22. \n\nTherefore, number of multisets is 22. Then, to get the number of sequences, we need to calculate for each multiset:\n\nHow many multisets are there with 0 zeros? That would be sequences of two distinct non-zero characters. The number of such multisets is C(6, 2) = 15. Each corresponds to 2! = 2 permutations. Total 15*2=30.\n\nMultisets with 1 zero: sequences with one zero and one non-zero. Number of multisets is C(6,1)=6. Each corresponds to 2 permutations (zero in first or second position). Total 6*2=12.\n\nMultisets with 2 zeros: 1 multiset, which corresponds to 1 permutation (\"00\"). Total 1*1=1.\n\nTotal N=30 + 12 + 1 = 43, which matches our previous result. And according to generating function coefficient, 22 multisets, and N is calculated as 43, which is not 22*something. Therefore, our original method of case analysis is correct, and generating function gives us the number of multisets, which we then have to convert to permutations by considering duplicates.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, since our case analysis checks out on smaller cases, I think our calculation of N=3720 is correct, so N/10 is 372.\n\nBut just to check another angle: total number of sequences without any restrictions would be 8^5? Wait, no, because there are 8 characters, but with duplicates. Wait, actually, if you consider that there are 8 characters, but with duplicates, how does that affect?\n\nWait, actually, if you consider that the characters are A, I, M, E, 2, 0, 0, 7. But when building sequences, if we allowed unlimited repetition, the number would be 7^5? No, because there are 7 unique characters: A, I, M, E, 2, 0, 7. Wait, original set has two 0s, but as unique characters, there are 7 unique ones. But if you allow unlimited repetition, it's 7^5. However, in our problem, repetition is limited. So our answer should be less than 7^5 = 16807. 3720 is less than that, which is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of another way. Let me calculate total number of sequences considering the multiplicities:\n\nThe total number is equal to the sum_{k=0}^2 [C(5, k) * P(6, 5 - k)] where k is the number of zeros. Wait, that's exactly what we did. For k=0: C(5,0)*P(6,5) but C(5,0) is 1. Wait no, actually in our case analysis, for k zeros, we have C(5, k) ways to place the zeros, and then P(6, 5 - k). Therefore total is sum_{k=0}^2 [C(5, k) * P(6, 5 - k)].\n\nCalculating:\n\nFor k=0: 1 * P(6,5) = 720\n\nFor k=1: 5 * P(6,4) = 5 * 360 = 1800\n\nFor k=2: 10 * P(6,3) = 10 * 120 = 1200\n\nTotal 720 + 1800 + 1200 = 3720. Yep, same result. So that formula gives us the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as arranging the letters with possible zeros. Since the only duplicate allowed is 0, up to two times.\n\nTherefore, I think confident that N is 3720, so N/10 is 372. Therefore, the answer is 372.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{372}\n</think>"}
