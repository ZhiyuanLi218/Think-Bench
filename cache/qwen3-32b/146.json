Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about spin in magnetic fields.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a particle with spin is placed in a magnetic field, its spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field. This is called Larmor precession. Since the magnetic field here is along the z-axis, the spin should precess around the z-axis. But how does that translate into the actual time evolution of the spin state?\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is given by the Zeeman term, right? So H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnetic field. For an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio is negative, but maybe I don't need to worry about the exact sign here. Since the magnetic field is along z, the Hamiltonian simplifies to H = -γ B_z S_z. Wait, but electrons have spin-1/2, so S_z is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_z. But maybe I should write the Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli matrices for simplicity.\n\nLet me recall that the Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is H = -γ **B** · **S**. For an electron, the spin operator S is (ħ/2)σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if the magnetic field is along z, H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_z. But actually, the energy should be proportional to the magnetic moment dotted with the magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is μ = -g_s (μ_B) S / ħ, where g_s is the electron g-factor (approximately 2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Therefore, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B = g_s μ_B B S_z / ħ. Wait, I might be mixing up signs here. Let me check.\n\nThe energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is U = -μ · B. For an electron, μ is proportional to the spin, μ = -g_s (μ_B / ħ) S. Therefore, H = -μ · B = g_s (μ_B / ħ) S · B. Since the magnetic field is along z, H = g_s μ_B B S_z / ħ. But S_z is (ħ/2) σ_z for spin-1/2. Therefore substituting that in, H = g_s μ_B B (ħ/2 σ_z) / ħ = (g_s μ_B B / 2) σ_z. So H = ω ħ σ_z / 2, where ω is the Larmor frequency? Wait, maybe I should just write H in terms of σ_z.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just take H proportional to σ_z. Since the exact constants might not matter for the time evolution, as they will go into the energy and hence the phase factors. But perhaps I need to be precise here. Let me think again.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is H = -γ **B** · **S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For an electron, γ is negative. Let me recall that γ_e = -g_s μ_B / ħ. Since g_s ≈ 2, γ ≈ -2 μ_B / ħ. But maybe I can just write H = ω S_z, where ω is some frequency. Let me see. Let me use H = ω S_z for simplicity, where ω incorporates all the constants. The exact value might not be necessary if I'm just looking for the time evolution in terms of phase factors.\n\nBut maybe I need to write the time evolution operator. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). If H is proportional to S_z, then the time evolution will induce phases on the eigenstates of S_z. However, our initial state is an eigenstate of S_y, not S_z. Therefore, I need to express the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of S_z, apply the time evolution, and then see how it evolves.\n\nSo first, let me recall the eigenstates of S_y. The spin-1/2 eigenstates along the y-direction can be written as:\n\n|+y> = (1/√2)( |+z> + i |−z> )\n\n|−y> = (1/√2)( |+z> − i |−z> )\n\nWhere |+z> and |−z> are the eigenstates of S_z. Let me verify this. The eigenstates of S_y are obtained by solving S_y |s> = (ħ/2) σ_y |s> = ±(ħ/2) |s>. The Pauli matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So solving for eigenvectors:\n\nFor eigenvalue +ħ/2:\n\n[σ_y - I]ψ = 0 => [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]ψ = 0. Let me check the eigenvectors. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that the eigenstates are (|+z> ± i |−z>)/√2. Let me check:\n\nLet me take ψ = (1/√2)( |+z> + i |−z> ). In components, this is [1/√2, i/√2]. Applying σ_y gives:\n\nσ_y [a, b] = [-i b, i a]. So σ_y [1/√2, i/√2] = [-i*(i/√2), i*(1/√2)] = [-i²/√2, i/√2] = [1/√2, i/√2] which is the same as the original vector. Therefore, this is indeed an eigenstate with eigenvalue +1 (times ħ/2). Similarly, the other eigenstate is [1/√2, -i/√2], which would give σ_y [1/√2, -i/√2] = [-i*(-i/√2), i*(1/√2)] = [-i²/√2, i/√2] = [-1/√2, i/√2] which is -[1/√2, -i/√2]. Wait, no:\n\nWait, let me recalculate. For ψ = [1/√2, -i/√2], σ_y ψ = [-i*(-i/√2), i*(1/√2)] = [-i²/√2, i/√2] = [ - ( -1 ) / √2 , i / √2 ] = [1/√2, i/√2]. Wait, but this is not proportional to the original ψ. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the eigenstate for -ħ/2 is (|+z> - i |−z>)/√2. Let me check:\n\nTake ψ = [1/√2, -i/√2]. Apply σ_y:\n\nσ_y [a, b] = [-i b, i a]. So:\n\n[-i * (-i/√2), i * (1/√2)] = [ -i² / √2 , i / √2 ] = [ -(-1)/√2 , i / √2 ] = [1/√2, i / √2]. Which is not a scalar multiple of ψ. Hmm, so that seems like it's not an eigenvector. Wait, perhaps I need to take the other combination?\n\nLet me try ψ = [1/√2, i/√2] for +ħ/2 and ψ = [1/√2, -i/√2] for -ħ/2? But when I applied σ_y to the second one, I didn't get a multiple. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write the eigenvalue equation:\n\nσ_y ψ = λ ψ.\n\nLet ψ = [a, b]. Then:\n\n-i b = λ a\n\ni a = λ b\n\nFrom the first equation: b = -i λ a / i = λ a / i ?\n\nWait:\n\nFirst equation: -i b = λ a => b = -i λ^{-1} a ?\n\nWait, solving:\n\nFrom first equation: -i b = λ a => b = (-i / λ) a\n\nSecond equation: i a = λ b => substitute b from first equation:\n\ni a = λ (-i / λ) a => i a = -i a => i a + i a = 0 => 2i a = 0 => a = 0. Wait, that can't be. Hmm, maybe I need to solve the equations together.\n\nLet me instead write the equations:\n\nFrom σ_y ψ = λ ψ:\n\n-i b = λ a\n\ni a = λ b\n\nLet me solve for λ. From first equation: b = (-i / λ) a. Substitute into second equation:\n\ni a = λ * (-i / λ) a => i a = -i a => i a + i a = 0 => 2i a = 0 => a = 0. Which would imply b = 0. Contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I need to take determinant?\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(σ_y - λ I) = 0.\n\nσ_y - λ I = [[ -λ, -i ], [i, -λ ]]\n\nDeterminant: λ² - (i)(i) = λ² - (-1) = λ² + 1 = 0 => λ = ±i. Wait, but eigenvalues of σ_y are ±i? But earlier, I thought they should be ±1. Wait, no, the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. Wait, maybe I messed up the determinant.\n\nWait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y - λ I is [[ -λ, -i ], [i, -λ ]]. Determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (i²) = λ² - (-1) = λ² + 1. So setting to zero, λ² = -1 => λ = ±i. But eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1. Wait, this is a contradiction. Where is the mistake?\n\nOh! Wait, Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but here I'm getting ±i. That can't be. Wait, no, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so they must have real eigenvalues. So there must be a mistake in my calculation. Let me recalculate the determinant.\n\nσ_y - λ I is [[ -λ, -i ], [i, -λ ]]. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) ). Let's compute (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. Therefore determinant is λ² - 1 = 0 => λ² = 1 => λ = ±1. Yes! There we go. I must have miscalculated earlier. So the eigenvalues are ±1, as expected. Therefore, solving for λ = +1:\n\nFrom -i b = λ a => -i b = a\n\nFrom i a = λ b => i a = b\n\nSo substituting b = i a into first equation: -i (i a) = a => -i² a = a => -(-1) a = a => a = a. Which is consistent. Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ = +1 satisfy b = i a. So taking a = 1/√2, b = i / √2. Therefore ψ = [1/√2, i/√2], which is |+y> as I originally thought. Similarly, for λ = -1:\n\nFrom -i b = -a => i b = a\n\nFrom i a = -b => b = -i a\n\nSubstitute into first equation: i (-i a) = a => -i² a = a => a = a. So eigenvectors satisfy b = -i a. Taking a = 1/√2, b = -i / √2, so ψ = [1/√2, -i/√2], which is |−y>. Okay, so that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the initial state is |+y> = (|+z> + i |−z>)/√2.\n\nNow, the time evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian H proportional to S_z. Let me write H explicitly. Let's recall that for a spin in magnetic field B along z, the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_z. For an electron, γ is negative. However, the exact form might not be crucial here because we can write the time evolution in terms of the energy splitting between |+z> and |−z>.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Assuming H = ω S_z, where ω incorporates all constants (like γ B and factors from spin), then:\n\nH |+z> = (ħ ω / 2) |+z>\n\nH |−z> = (-ħ ω / 2) |−z>\n\nTherefore, the time evolution of each eigenstate is:\n\n|+z>(t) = exp(-i (ħ ω / 2) t / ħ) |+z> = exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z>\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|−z>(t) = exp(-i (-ħ ω / 2) t / ħ) |−z> = exp(i ω t / 2) |−z>\n\nTherefore, the initial state |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |−z>, so applying the time evolution:\n\n|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z> + i exp(i ω t / 2) |−z> ]\n\nLet me factor out exp(-i ω t / 2):\n\n|ψ(t)> = exp(-i ω t / 2) * (1/√2) [ |+z> + i exp(i ω t) |−z> ]\n\nAlternatively, let's write the full expression:\n\n(1/√2) [ exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z> + i exp(i ω t / 2) |−z> ]\n\nLet me combine the exponents:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n(1/√2) exp(-i ω t / 2) [ |+z> + i exp(i ω t) |−z> ]\n\nBut maybe I can write the state as:\n\n(1/√2) [ |+z> exp(-i ω t / 2) + i |−z> exp(i ω t / 2) ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n(1/√2) exp(-i ω t / 2) [ |+z> + i exp(i ω t) |−z> ]\n\nAlternatively, let me factor differently. Let me consider the relative phase between the two terms. Let me write the state as:\n\n(1/√2) exp(-i ω t / 2) [ |+z> + i exp(i ω t) |−z> ].\n\nBut maybe I can write this as:\n\nexp(-i ω t / 2) * [ (1/√2) |+z> + (i / √2) exp(i ω t) |−z> ].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire state in terms of rotation. Since the time evolution is generated by S_z, which corresponds to rotation around the z-axis. The initial state is along y, and rotating around z should cause the spin to precess in the x-y plane.\n\nLet me recall that a rotation around the z-axis by angle θ is given by exp(-i θ S_z / ħ). Comparing with our time evolution, which is exp(-i H t / ħ). If H = ω S_z, then the time evolution is exp(-i ω S_z t / ħ). If ω is the Larmor frequency, then ω = γ B. But regardless, the time evolution is equivalent to a rotation around z by angle θ = ω t / something. Let me check the dimensions. The exponent must be dimensionless. If H = ω S_z, then ω must have units of energy / ħ. Let me not get bogged down by constants here. The key point is that the time evolution is a rotation around the z-axis, so the spin state will rotate in the x-y plane.\n\nGiven that, if initially the spin is along +y, then after time t, it will have rotated by some angle around the z-axis. The angle of rotation is determined by the Larmor frequency and time. So the spin will precess in the x-y plane, maintaining its magnitude but changing direction.\n\nTherefore, the spin state at time t should be along the direction obtained by rotating the initial +y direction around the z-axis by angle φ = ω t. Let me verify this intuition with the algebra.\n\nLet me parametrize the spin state. Let me write the general spin state as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The initial state is along +y, which corresponds to angles θ = π/2, φ = π/2 (spherical coordinates). After rotation around z by angle φ = ω t, the new azimuthal angle becomes φ' = π/2 + ω t, while θ remains π/2. Therefore, the new direction is (θ = π/2, φ = π/2 + ω t), which is in the x-y plane, making an angle ω t with the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, the spin state at time t is along the direction (π/2, π/2 + ω t). To write this as a quantum state, we can express it as:\n\n|ψ(t)> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) |−z>\n\nBut since θ = π/2, cos(θ/2) = cos(π/4) = 1/√2, sin(θ/2) = sin(π/4) = 1/√2. Therefore,\n\n|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) |+z> + e^{i φ} (1/√2) |−z> where φ = π/2 + ω t.\n\nBut the initial state at t=0 is φ = π/2, so:\n\nAt t=0, |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) |+z> + e^{i π/2} (1/√2) |−z> = (1/√2) |+z> + i (1/√2) |−z> which matches |+y> as expected.\n\nTherefore, at time t, the state is:\n\n|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) |+z> + e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} (1/√2) |−z>\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(1/√2) |+z> + e^{i π/2} e^{i ω t} (1/√2) |−z> = e^{i π/2} [ (1/√2) |+z> + e^{i ω t} (1/√2) |−z> ]\n\nBut e^{i π/2} is a global phase factor, which doesn't affect the physical state. Therefore, the physical state is:\n\n(1/√2) |+z> + e^{i ω t} (1/√2) |−z>\n\nWhich matches the earlier expression we had from the time evolution, except for the global phase factor exp(-i ω t / 2). However, since global phases don't matter, we can write the state as:\n\n(1/√2) |+z> + e^{i ω t} (1/√2) |−z>\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it without the global phase, let's go back to the expression from the time evolution:\n\n|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z> + i exp(i ω t / 2) |−z> ]\n\nLet me factor out exp(-i ω t / 2):\n\n= exp(-i ω t / 2) * [ (1/√2) |+z> + i exp(i ω t) (1/√2) |−z> ]\n\nWhich is:\n\nexp(-i ω t / 2) * [ (1/√2) |+z> + (i / √2) exp(i ω t) |−z> ]\n\nBut i exp(i ω t) = exp(i π/2) exp(i ω t) = exp(i (ω t + π/2)).\n\nTherefore, the state inside the brackets is:\n\n(1/√2) |+z> + exp(i (ω t + π/2)) (1/√2) |−z>\n\nWhich is the same as the Bloch sphere expression above, with φ = π/2 + ω t. Therefore, this confirms that the spin precesses around the z-axis with angular frequency ω.\n\nBut what is ω? Let me recall that the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_z. For an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is negative. Let me recall that γ = -g_s μ_B / ħ, where g_s ≈ 2, μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Therefore, H = γ B S_z = -g_s μ_B B S_z / ħ. But since S_z = ħ/2 σ_z, substituting:\n\nH = -g_s μ_B B (ħ/2 σ_z) / ħ = -g_s μ_B B σ_z / 2.\n\nBut the energy difference between |+z> and |−z> is ΔE = 2 (g_s μ_B B / 2) ) = g_s μ_B B. Therefore, the frequency ω is ΔE / ħ = g_s μ_B B / ħ. However, since the time evolution is given by exp(-i H t / ħ), then the time evolution for each state is:\n\nFor |+z>, exp(i γ B S_z t / ħ). Wait, no:\n\nWait H = -γ B S_z. Therefore, the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i γ B S_z t / ħ). For |+z>, S_z = ħ/2, so:\n\nexp(i γ B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) = exp(i γ B t / 2). Since γ is negative for electron, this becomes exp(-i |γ| B t / 2). Therefore, the frequency ω is |γ| B. But perhaps I don't need to get bogged down by the exact expression for ω. The problem doesn't give specific values, so maybe I can just leave it as ω, or express it in terms of the Larmor frequency.\n\nHowever, the question asks to determine the spin state for t > 0. So, in terms of the quantum state, we have:\n\n|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(-i ω t / 2) |+z> + (i / √2) exp(i ω t / 2) |−z>\n\nBut we can also write this state in terms of the eigenstates of S_y or other directions. However, since the problem doesn't specify in which basis to express the final state, but asks for the spin state, probably expressing it in terms of |+z> and |−z> with time-dependent phases is acceptable. However, maybe we can write it as a spinor and see if it can be expressed as a rotated state.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that the spin precesses around the z-axis, we can describe the direction of the spin at time t. As mentioned earlier, the spin direction is obtained by rotating the initial +y direction around z by angle φ = ω t. Therefore, the spin is in the direction (θ = π/2, φ = π/2 + ω t). Therefore, the spinor can be written as:\n\n|ψ(t)> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) |−z>\n\nBut θ = π/2, so cos(θ/2) = 1/√2, sin(θ/2) = 1/√2, so:\n\n|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) |+z> + e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} (1/√2) |−z>\n\nWhich is the same as before, up to a global phase. Therefore, the physical state is:\n\n(1/√2) |+z> + e^{i ω t} (i / √2) |−z> ?\n\nWait no, earlier we had e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} which is i e^{i ω t}. Wait, let's see:\n\nAt t=0, the state is (1/√2)|+z> + e^{i π/2} (1/√2)|−z> = (1/√2)|+z> + i (1/√2)|−z>, which is correct. So for general t, it's (1/√2)|+z> + e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} (1/√2)|−z>. Therefore, the state can be written as:\n\n(1/√2)|+z> + e^{i π/2} e^{i ω t} (1/√2)|−z> = e^{i π/2} [ (1/√2)|+z> + e^{i ω t} (1/√2)|−z> ]\n\nBut since e^{i π/2} is a global phase, we can ignore it, so the state is:\n\n(1/√2)|+z> + e^{i ω t} (1/√2)|−z>\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n[ |+z> + e^{i ω t} |−z> ] / √2\n\nTherefore, this is the spin state at time t. Now, we can write this in terms of the eigenstates of S_x or S_y if needed, but unless the question asks for a specific representation, this is probably sufficient. However, let me check if there's a more simplified form or if we can write it in terms of a rotation operator.\n\nAlternatively, since the time evolution operator is a rotation around z-axis, we can write |ψ(t)> = exp(-i ω S_z t / ħ) |+y>. But maybe we can relate this to rotation matrices.\n\nThe rotation operator around z-axis by angle α is given by:\n\nR_z(α) = exp(-i α S_z / ħ)\n\nIf we take α = ω t, then:\n\nR_z(ω t) |+y> = |ψ(t)>\n\nBut how does this act on |+y>? Well, since |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |−z>, as we saw, and the rotation would cause the phase difference between them to change with time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parameterize the spin state using Euler angles or something else, but I think we have a sufficient expression already.\n\nBut let me check if this state can be written as an eigenstate of some spin component. For example, if we define a new axis in the x-y plane at angle φ = ω t from the y-axis, then the state would be the eigenstate of S along that new axis. However, since the problem doesn't specify in which basis to express the state, perhaps expressing it in terms of |+z> and |−z> with time-dependent phases is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write the spinor components explicitly, let's do that. The state is:\n\n|ψ(t)> = [1/√2, (i / √2) e^{i ω t}]^T ?\n\nWait, let me recall that |+z> is [1, 0]^T and |−z> is [0, 1]^T. Therefore, the state is:\n\n(1/√2) |+z> + (e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} / √2) |−z> = [1/√2, e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} / √2]^T\n\nSince e^{i π/2} = i, this is [1/√2, i e^{i ω t} / √2]^T. Which can be written as [1, i e^{i ω t}]^T / √2.\n\nAlternatively, factor out e^{i ω t / 2}:\n\nLet me write e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} = e^{i π/2} e^{i ω t} = i e^{i ω t}. Therefore, the spinor is [1, i e^{i ω t}] / √2.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as [1, i e^{i ω t}] / √2. Let me see if this can be simplified further. Let me write e^{i ω t} = cos(ω t) + i sin(ω t). Therefore:\n\ni e^{i ω t} = i cos(ω t) - sin(ω t).\n\nTherefore, the spinor becomes [1, -sin(ω t) + i cos(ω t)] / √2. Alternatively, factor:\n\n-sin(ω t) + i cos(ω t) = i (cos(ω t) + i sin(ω t)) = i e^{i ω t}, which brings us back. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that [1, i e^{i ω t}] / √2 can be expressed as e^{-i ω t / 2} [ e^{i ω t / 2}, i e^{i 3ω t / 2} ] / √2, but this seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the spin is precessing in the x-y plane, we can write the expectation values of S_x, S_y, S_z. For example, the expectation value of S_z should be zero, since the spin is in the x-y plane. Let me verify:\n\nCompute <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.\n\nSince S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, S_z |−z> = -(ħ/2)|−z>, then:\n\n<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = (1/√2)(1/√2) [ <+z| S_z |+z> + <+z| S_z e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} |−z> + e^{-i (π/2 + ω t)} <+z| S_z |−z> + e^{-i (π/2 + ω t)} e^{i (π/2 + ω t)} <−z| S_z |−z> ].\n\nBut most terms are zero:\n\n<+z| S_z |+z> = ħ/2, <−z| S_z |−z> = -ħ/2, cross terms involve <+z| S_z |−z> = 0 and <+z|−z> = 0. Therefore:\n\n<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = (1/2)( ħ/2 + (-ħ/2) ) = 0. Which matches our expectation.\n\nSimilarly, compute <S_x> and <S_y>. Let me recall that S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, S_y = ħ/2 σ_y. Let me compute <S_x> and <S_y>.\n\nFirst, write the spinor as ψ = [a, b]^T = [1/√2, i e^{i ω t}/√2]^T.\n\nThen, <S_x> = (ħ/2) Re(a* b + b* a) ?\n\nWait, more carefully:\n\n<S_x> = ψ† S_x ψ = (ħ/2) ψ† σ_x ψ.\n\nσ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Therefore:\n\nψ† σ_x ψ = [a*, b*] [[0, 1], [1, 0]] [a; b] = a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b).\n\nSimilarly for <S_y> = (ħ/2) ψ† σ_y ψ.\n\nCompute a* b: a = 1/√2, b = i e^{i ω t}/√2.\n\nTherefore, a* b = (1/√2)(i e^{i ω t}/√2) = i e^{i ω t} / 2.\n\nSimilarly, b* a = (-i e^{-i ω t}/√2)(1/√2) = -i e^{-i ω t}/2.\n\nTherefore, ψ† σ_x ψ = i e^{i ω t}/2 + (-i e^{-i ω t}/2) = i [ e^{i ω t} - e^{-i ω t} ] / 2 = i [ 2i sin(ω t) ] / 2 = i² sin(ω t) = - sin(ω t).\n\nTherefore, <S_x> = (ħ/2)(- sin(ω t)).\n\nSimilarly, compute <S_y> = (ħ/2) ψ† σ_y ψ. σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\nTherefore, ψ† σ_y ψ = [a*, b*] [[0, -i], [i, 0]] [a; b] = -i a* b + i b* a = i (b* a - a* b).\n\nCompute b* a - a* b = (-i e^{-i ω t}/2) - (i e^{i ω t}/2) = -i [ e^{-i ω t} + e^{i ω t} ] / 2 = -i [ 2 cos(ω t) ] / 2 = -i cos(ω t).\n\nTherefore, ψ† σ_y ψ = i (-i cos(ω t)) = cos(ω t). Therefore, <S_y> = (ħ/2) cos(ω t).\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of the spin is:\n\n<S> = [ - (ħ/2) sin(ω t), (ħ/2) cos(ω t), 0 ]\n\nWhich is indeed a vector of magnitude ħ/2 rotating in the x-y plane with angular frequency ω, starting along +y at t=0 (since at t=0, sin(0)=0, cos(0)=1, so <S> = [0, ħ/2, 0]).\n\nTherefore, this confirms that the spin precesses around the z-axis with angular frequency ω, and the quantum state is given by |ψ(t)> = [1/√2, i e^{i ω t}/√2]^T, or equivalently in Dirac notation:\n\n|ψ(t)> = (1/√2)|+z> + (i e^{i ω t}/√2)|−z>\n\nNow, the question is to determine the spin state for t > 0. Depending on what is expected, the answer could be expressed in terms of the time-evolved state in the z-basis, or as a spinor, or by stating that it precesses around the z-axis. However, since the initial state was given in terms of a measurement along y, and the problem is likely expecting a quantum state expressed in some basis, probably the z-basis is acceptable.\n\nBut maybe we can also express it in terms of the eigenstates of S_y at time t? Well, since the spin is precessing, at time t it's along a different direction in the x-y plane, so it would be an eigenstate of S along that direction. However, unless specified, it's probably safer to present it in the z-basis with time-dependent phases.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it without reference to ω, we can relate ω to the physical parameters. Recall that ω is the Larmor frequency, which is given by ω = γ B, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For an electron, γ = -g_s μ_B / ħ, but since we're dealing with magnitude, we can write ω = |γ| B. However, since the problem doesn't give specific values, we can just leave it as ω.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the Pauli matrices or in terms of a rotation operator. However, given the information, I think the most precise answer is expressing the state in the z-basis with the time-dependent phases as above.\n\nTherefore, the spin state at time t > 0 is:\n\n|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) e^{-i ω t / 2} |+z> + (i / √2) e^{i ω t / 2} |−z>\n\nBut we can also factor out a phase. Let me see:\n\nLet me write both terms with exponents:\n\nFirst term: exp(-i ω t / 2) / √2\n\nSecond term: i exp(i ω t / 2) / √2 = exp(i π/2) exp(i ω t / 2) / √2 = exp(i (ω t / 2 + π/2)) / √2\n\nAlternatively, write both terms with a common factor. Let me see:\n\nLet me take exp(-i ω t / 2) as a common factor:\n\n= exp(-i ω t / 2) [ |+z> / √2 + i exp(i ω t) |−z> / √2 ]\n\nWhich is:\n\nexp(-i ω t / 2) [ |+z> + i exp(i ω t) |−z> ] / √2\n\nBut this is as simplified as it gets. Since global phases don't matter, we can write the state as:\n\n[ |+z> + i exp(i ω t) |−z> ] / √2\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n[ |+z> + exp(i (ω t + π/2)) |−z> ] / √2\n\nBut since the problem might expect a specific form, perhaps we can relate ω to the Hamiltonian. If we recall that H = ω ħ σ_z / 2 (assuming H proportional to σ_z), then the time evolution is generated by H, and ω is determined by the magnetic field and constants. However, without specific values, we can't simplify further.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write the state using the time evolution operator explicitly, we can say that the state is:\n\n|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+y>\n\nBut unless we have an explicit form for H, this might not be helpful.\n\nIn summary, after going through the derivation, the spin state at time t > 0 is a superposition of |+z> and |−z> with relative phase depending on ω t, where ω is the Larmor frequency determined by the magnetic field and the electron's properties. The exact expression is:\n\n|ψ(t)> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} e^{-i \\omega t / 2} |+z\\rangle + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} e^{i \\omega t / 2} |-z\\rangle\n\nOr, omitting the global phase factor, it can be written as:\n\n|ψ(t)> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |+z\\rangle + \\frac{e^{i (\\omega t + \\pi/2)}}{\\sqrt{2}} |-z\\rangle\n\nWhich shows the spin precessing around the z-axis.\n\nSince the problem is likely expecting an expression in terms of the Pauli matrices or the standard spin states, and given that the initial state was along y, the final answer is best expressed as above. However, to make it more explicit, maybe write it as a spinor:\n\nψ(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ i e^{i \\omega t} \\end{pmatrix}\n\nYes, this is a concise way to write it. Therefore, the spin state for t > 0 is this spinor.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe spin state for $ t > 0 $ is $ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ i e^{i\\omega t} \\end{pmatrix}} $, where $ \\omega $ is the Larmor frequency.\n</think>"}
