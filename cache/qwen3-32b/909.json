The problem mentions using L, specific heat capacity c_p, expansion coefficient α, and specific volume v for each phase at initial T and p. Let me start by recalling what I know about latent heat and phase transitions.\n\nFirst, latent heat L is the amount of energy required to change the phase of a substance without changing its temperature. For example, the heat of fusion or vaporization. But here, we need to find how this latent heat changes with temperature along the phase boundary. \n\nI remember that there are some thermodynamic relations involving phase transitions, like the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. But this is about dL/dT, not directly about the slope of the phase boundary dp/dT. Maybe I need to derive an expression for dL/dT using thermodynamic potentials or relations?\n\nLet me think about the latent heat. For a phase transition between two phases, say solid and liquid, the latent heat L is the difference in enthalpy between the two phases: L = H_2 - H_1. Similarly, since enthalpy is a function of temperature and pressure, if we consider moving along the phase boundary, both T and p change, so H for each phase will change. Therefore, the latent heat L would also change with T. \n\nSo, if I want dL/dT along the phase equilibrium line, I can write:\n\ndL/dT = d(H_2 - H_1)/dT = (dH_2/dT) - (dH_1/dT)\n\nBut since we're moving along the phase boundary, the pressure p is not independent of T; it's determined by the phase equilibrium condition. Therefore, when taking the derivative of H with respect to T, we need to consider both the explicit dependence on T and the implicit dependence through p, which changes with T along the phase boundary. \n\nSo, using the chain rule, for each phase, the derivative of enthalpy with respect to temperature would be:\n\ndH/dT = (∂H/∂T)_p + (∂H/∂p)_T * (dp/dT)\n\nBut wait, along the phase boundary, the pressure p is a function of T, so when taking the total derivative of H with respect to T, we have to account for the change in p. However, for each phase, H is a function of T and p. Therefore, for phase 1 and phase 2:\n\ndH_1/dT = (∂H_1/∂T)_p + (∂H_1/∂p)_T * (dp/dT)\n\nSimilarly for phase 2:\n\ndH_2/dT = (∂H_2/∂T)_p + (∂H_2/∂p)_T * (dp/dT)\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the latent heat L = H_2 - H_1 is:\n\ndL/dT = [ (∂H_2/∂T)_p + (∂H_2/∂p)_T * (dp/dT) ] - [ (∂H_1/∂T)_p + (∂H_1/∂p)_T * (dp/dT) ]\n\nSimplifying:\n\ndL/dT = [ (∂H_2/∂T)_p - (∂H_1/∂T)_p ] + [ (∂H_2/∂p)_T - (∂H_1/∂p)_T ] * (dp/dT )\n\nBut (∂H/∂T)_p is the heat capacity at constant pressure, which is c_p. Therefore, for each phase, (∂H/∂T)_p = c_p. Therefore, the first term becomes c_p2 - c_p1.\n\nNow, the second term involves (∂H_2/∂p)_T - (∂H_1/∂p)_T multiplied by dp/dT. Let me recall that the derivative of enthalpy with respect to pressure at constant temperature. For a single phase, (∂H/∂p)_T can be expressed using thermodynamic relations. \n\nI remember that for enthalpy H, we have the relation:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = -T(∂V/∂T)_p + V\n\nWait, let me check that. The general expression for (∂H/∂p)_T. Starting from the definition of enthalpy H = U + pV. Then, dH = TdS + Vdp. At constant T, we can write:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = T(∂S/∂p)_T + V\n\nBut using Maxwell relations or other relations... Alternatively, using the chain rule and the definition of expansion coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, using the relation:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = V - T(∂V/∂T)_p\n\nYes, this is a standard thermodynamic relation. Let me verify that. \n\nFrom the fundamental equation of enthalpy: dH = TdS + Vdp. Then, at constant T, we can write:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = T(∂S/∂p)_T + V\n\nBut from the Maxwell relation, (∂S/∂p)_T = - (∂V/∂T)_p. Therefore:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = -T(∂V/∂T)_p + V = V(1 - T(∂V/∂T)_p / V )\n\nBut the expansion coefficient α is defined as (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_p. Therefore:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = V(1 - T α ) \n\nWait, but α is (∂V/∂T)_p / V, so T(∂V/∂T)_p = T V α. Therefore:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = V - T V α = V (1 - T α )\n\nWait, but actually, (∂H/∂p)_T = V - T(∂V/∂T)_p = V(1 - T α / V * V )? Wait:\n\nWait, (∂H/∂p)_T = V - T(∂V/∂T)_p. Since α is (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_p, then (∂V/∂T)_p = α V. Therefore:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = V - T α V = V (1 - T α )\n\nWait, but that seems dimensionally okay. So for each phase, (∂H/∂p)_T = V(1 - T α ). Therefore, the difference between phase 2 and phase 1 is:\n\n[ V2(1 - T α2 ) - V1(1 - T α1 ) ] = (V2 - V1) - T (V2 α2 - V1 α1 )\n\nBut we also have that along the phase boundary, dp/dT is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dp/dT = (L / T Δv), where Δv is the difference in specific volume between the two phases. Wait, more precisely, dp/dT = (ΔS / ΔV), where ΔS is the entropy difference and ΔV is the volume difference. Since L = T ΔS, so ΔS = L / T, so dp/dT = (L / T ) / ΔV = L / (T ΔV ). Therefore, dp/dT = L / (T ΔV ). \n\nBut here, ΔV is V2 - V1, depending on the direction. Let me make sure. For example, in the case of fusion (solid to liquid), ΔV = V_liquid - V_solid. Given the data in the problem, for ice and water at triple point, specific volume of solid is 1.12 cm³/g, liquid is 1.00 cm³/g, so ΔV is negative, which makes sense because ice expands upon freezing. \n\nAnyway, regardless of the sign, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dp/dT = (L / T ) / (V2 - V1 ). Assuming that L is the latent heat corresponding to the phase transition, which is H2 - H1. \n\nSo, going back to our expression for dL/dT:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + [ (V2(1 - T α2 ) - V1(1 - T α1 )) ] * (dp/dT )\n\nBut substituting dp/dT from Clausius-Clapeyron:\n\ndp/dT = L / [ T (V2 - V1) ]\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + [ (V2 - V1) - T (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) ] * [ L / ( T (V2 - V1) ) ]\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n[ (V2 - V1) - T (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) ] / [ T (V2 - V1) ] * L \n\nBreaking this into two fractions:\n\n[ (V2 - V1) / (T (V2 - V1)) ) - T (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / ( T (V2 - V1) ) ] * L \n\nSimplifies to:\n\n[ 1 / T - (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / (V2 - V1 ) ] * L \n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + L [ 1 / T - (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / (V2 - V1 ) ]\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + (L / T ) - L [ (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / (V2 - V1 ) ]\n\nBut note that (V2 - V1 ) is ΔV, and (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / ΔV is some term. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write this as:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + L / T - L [ (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / (V2 - V1 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, combining terms:\n\ndL/dT = [c_p2 - c_p1 + L / T ] - L [ (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / (V2 - V1 ) ]\n\nBut I need to check if this is the most simplified or standard form. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the entire expression in terms of the individual phases. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a standard formula for dL/dT. Let me check my steps again to make sure.\n\nStarting from:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + [ (∂H_2/∂p)_T - (∂H_1/∂p)_T ] * (dp/dT )\n\nThen, using (∂H/∂p)_T = V - T α V ?\n\nWait, earlier I thought (∂H/∂p)_T = V(1 - T α ). Wait, no, let's re-examine:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = V - T(∂V/∂T)_p. Since α = (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_p, then (∂V/∂T)_p = α V. Therefore:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = V - T α V = V (1 - T α )\n\nWait, but T α is dimensionless? Wait, α has units of 1/temperature. So T α is dimensionless. Yes. So, (∂H/∂p)_T = V(1 - T α ). Wait, but hold on, if we have (∂H/∂p)_T = V - T(∂V/∂T)_p, then substituting (∂V/∂T)_p = α V gives:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = V - T α V = V (1 - α T )\n\nBut this seems strange because, for example, if α is positive (which it usually is), then (∂H/∂p)_T is less than V. But I think the derivation is correct. Let me check with an ideal gas. For an ideal gas, H is independent of pressure at constant temperature? Wait, no. For ideal gas, enthalpy is a function of temperature only. Therefore, (∂H/∂p)_T = 0. Let's check with our formula. For ideal gas, α = 1/V (∂V/∂T)_p = (1/V)(nR/p)^{-1} (nR/p) )? Wait, for ideal gas, V = nRT/p. Therefore, (∂V/∂T)_p = nR/p = V / T. Therefore, α = (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_p = 1/T. Therefore, our formula gives:\n\n(∂H/∂p)_T = V (1 - T * α ) = V (1 - T*(1/T)) = V(1 - 1) = 0, which matches the ideal gas result. So the formula is correct. Good.\n\nTherefore, going back, for each phase, (∂H/∂p)_T = V(1 - T α ). Therefore, the difference between phase 2 and phase 1 is:\n\n[ V2(1 - T α2 ) - V1(1 - T α1 ) ] = (V2 - V1) - T( V2 α2 - V1 α1 )\n\nTherefore, the term [ (∂H_2/∂p)_T - (∂H_1/∂p)_T ] is equal to that. Then multiplied by dp/dT.\n\nSo then, substituting dp/dT from Clausius-Clapeyron:\n\ndp/dT = L / [ T (V2 - V1) ]\n\nTherefore, the entire expression:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + [ (V2 - V1) - T( V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) ] * [ L / ( T (V2 - V1) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies as:\n\n= (c_p2 - c_p1) + [ 1 - T( V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / (V2 - V1 ) ] * ( L / T )\n\nBreaking this into two terms:\n\n= (c_p2 - c_p1) + L / T - L * [ T( V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / ( T (V2 - V1 ) ) ]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n= (c_p2 - c_p1) + L / T - L * [ ( V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / ( V2 - V1 ) ]\n\nTherefore, combining terms:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + (L / T ) - L * [ ( V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / ( V2 - V1 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as:\n\ndL/dT = c_p2 - c_p1 + L / T - L * [ (V2 α2 - V1 α1 ) / ΔV ]\n\nwhere ΔV = V2 - V1.\n\nBut the problem says to express the result using L, c_p, α, and v of each phase. Therefore, we can write this as:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + (L / T ) - L * [ (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) / (v2 - v1 ) ]\n\nSince specific volume is v, so V is mass times specific volume, but since we're dealing with specific quantities (per unit mass), perhaps in the problem's data, they give specific volumes and specific heat capacities. Let me check the given data:\n\nYes, the problem mentions specific volume of solid and liquid states (in cm³/g), heat of fusion and vaporization (in cal/g). So all quantities are per gram. Therefore, in the above derivation, H is specific enthalpy, so c_p is specific heat capacity at constant pressure (per gram), α is the expansion coefficient (which is intensive, so same regardless of mass), and v is specific volume (per gram). Therefore, the formula I derived is already in terms of specific quantities. Therefore, the final expression is as above.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to write this. Let me think if there is a standard formula for dL/dT. \n\nAlternatively, I can consider that for each phase, the enthalpy H(T,p) can be expanded. Along the phase boundary, the two phases have equal chemical potentials, so their enthalpies differ by L = H_2 - H_1. Taking derivative with respect to T, considering that p is a function of T along the phase boundary.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me recall that for a first-order phase transition, the latent heat L is related to the entropy difference between phases: L = T Δs, where Δs is the difference in specific entropy between the two phases. Therefore, L = T (s2 - s1). Therefore, taking derivative with respect to T:\n\ndL/dT = T d(Δs)/dT + Δs\n\nBut since L = T Δs, Δs = L / T. Therefore:\n\ndL/dT = T d(Δs)/dT + L / T\n\nBut how to find d(Δs)/dT?\n\nWe can use the chain rule again. For each phase, the specific entropy s is a function of T and p. Therefore, along the phase boundary, the derivative ds/dT for each phase is:\n\nds/dT = (∂s/∂T)_p + (∂s/∂p)_T * (dp/dT)\n\nTherefore, Δs = s2 - s1, so d(Δs)/dT = [ (∂s2/∂T)_p + (∂s2/∂p)_T * (dp/dT) ] - [ (∂s1/∂T)_p + (∂s1/∂p)_T * (dp/dT) ]\n\nWhich is similar to what we had before. Now, (∂s/∂T)_p is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure divided by T, since c_p = T (∂s/∂T)_p. Therefore, (∂s/∂T)_p = c_p / T. \n\nAlso, (∂s/∂p)_T can be related to other thermodynamic quantities. From the Maxwell relations, we know that (∂s/∂p)_T = - (∂v/∂T)_p = - α v. \n\nTherefore, putting this together:\n\nd(Δs)/dT = [ c_p2 / T - c_p1 / T ] + [ - α2 v2 + α1 v1 ] * (dp/dT )\n\nTherefore, going back to the expression for dL/dT:\n\ndL/dT = T [ (c_p2 - c_p1)/T + ( - α2 v2 + α1 v1 ) * (dp/dT ) ] + L / T \n\nSimplify:\n\n= (c_p2 - c_p1) + T [ ( - α2 v2 + α1 v1 ) * (dp/dT ) ] + L / T \n\nWhich is the same as:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + L / T - (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) * T (dp/dT )\n\nWait, because -(α2 v2 - α1 v1 ) is (α1 v1 - α2 v2 ), so multiplying by T (dp/dT ) gives - (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) * T (dp/dT ). \n\nBut previously, we had:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + L / T - L [ (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) / (v2 - v1 ) ]\n\nTherefore, comparing the two expressions, we have:\n\n- (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) * T (dp/dT ) = - L [ (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) / (v2 - v1 ) ]\n\nTherefore, this implies that:\n\nT (dp/dT ) = L / (v2 - v1 )\n\nWhich is indeed the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, since dp/dT = L / [ T (v2 - v1 ) ].\n\nTherefore, the two approaches agree. Therefore, the expression for dL/dT is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final expression is:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + L / T - L * [ (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) / (v2 - v1 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, factor out L:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + L [ 1 / T - (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) / (v2 - v1 ) ]\n\nThis seems to be the general expression. Let me check if this is dimensionally consistent. All terms should have units of energy per temperature (since L is energy per mass, and derivative dL/dT is energy per mass per temperature). Let's see:\n\n- (c_p2 - c_p1): specific heat capacity, which is energy per mass per temperature. So that term is okay.\n\n- L / T: L is energy per mass, T is temperature, so energy per mass per temperature. Okay.\n\n- The third term: L multiplied by [ ... ] which is dimensionless. Since α is 1/temperature, and v is volume per mass. So (v α ) has units of (volume/mass * 1/temperature ) = (volume)/(mass * temperature ). Then, dividing by (v2 - v1 ), which is volume/mass, gives 1/temperature. Then multiplied by L (energy/mass ) gives energy/mass / temperature, which matches. So yes, all terms are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the formula is dimensionally correct.\n\nSo, this seems to be the required expression. The problem says to express it using L, c_p, α, and specific volume v of each phase. Therefore, writing it in terms of the variables for each phase:\n\nLet me denote phase 1 and phase 2. For example, if we are considering the fusion curve (solid-liquid), then phase 1 is solid, phase 2 is liquid. Similarly for vaporization, phase 1 is liquid, phase 2 is gas.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + (L / T) - L * [ (v2 α2 - v1 α1 ) / (v2 - v1 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, written as:\n\ndL/dT = c_p2 - c_p1 + \\frac{L}{T} - L \\cdot \\frac{v_2 \\alpha_2 - v_1 \\alpha_1}{v_2 - v_1}\n\nThis seems to be the answer. Let me check literature or textbooks to see if this formula is standard. \n\nI recall that there is a relation called the \"Gibbs-Helmholtz equation\" which relates the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy, but here we are dealing with latent heat. However, the derivation we did seems correct and consistent with thermodynamic relations. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the fact that along the coexistence curve, the chemical potentials are equal. Taking derivatives of the equality condition. But I think the approach we took is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final expression is as derived above. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dT} = (c_{p2} - c_{p1}) + \\frac{L}{T} - L \\cdot \\frac{v_2 \\alpha_2 - v_1 \\alpha_1}{v_2 - v_1}\n$$\n\nOr, written with more explicit notation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dT} = c_p^{(2)} - c_p^{(1)} + \\frac{L}{T} - L \\cdot \\frac{v^{(2)} \\alpha^{(2)} - v^{(1)} \\alpha^{(1)}}{v^{(2)} - v^{(1)}}\n$$\n\nWhere superscripts (1) and (2) denote the two phases in equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, this is the required expression. The problem didn't specify which two phases, but since it's general for any phase equilibrium line, this formula holds for any pair of phases, as long as we take the appropriate specific quantities for each phase.\n\nLet me check if this formula reduces to known cases. For example, consider the case where the specific volumes are the same, v2 = v1. But that would mean Δv = 0, which would imply infinite dp/dT, which is unphysical. However, in reality, v2 ≠ v1 at phase transitions. \n\nAnother check: suppose α1 = α2 = 0, which would be the case if the specific volumes are independent of temperature (which is not realistic, but for the sake of checking). Then the third term becomes - L * [ 0 - 0 ] / Δv = 0. So dL/dT = c_p2 - c_p1 + L / T. Is this reasonable? \n\nIf the volumes don't change with temperature (α = 0), then (∂H/∂p)_T = V(1 - 0 ) = V. Therefore, the difference [ (∂H_2/∂p)_T - (∂H_1/∂p)_T ] = V2 - V1 = ΔV. Then multiplied by dp/dT = L / [ T ΔV ] gives (ΔV) * [ L / ( T ΔV ) ] = L / T. Therefore, adding to (c_p2 - c_p1) gives total dL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + L / T. Which matches the above. So this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct in this case. \n\nAnother check: if the phases have the same expansion coefficients, α1 = α2 = α. Then the term [v2 α - v1 α ] / (v2 - v1 ) = α [v2 - v1 ] / [v2 - v1 ] = α. Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\ndL/dT = (c_p2 - c_p1) + L / T - L α.\n\nBut is there another way to think about this? If α is the same for both phases, then perhaps... Not sure, but the derivation is consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct expression. Therefore, the answer is:\n\ndL/dT equals the difference in specific heat capacities of the two phases plus L over T minus L times the difference in (specific volume times expansion coefficient) divided by the difference in specific volumes.\n\nTherefore, boxed:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{ \\frac{dL}{dT} = c_{p2} - c_{p1} + \\frac{L}{T} - L \\cdot \\frac{v_2 \\alpha_2 - v_1 \\alpha_1}{v_2 - v_1} }\n$$\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe variation of the latent heat ratio with temperature is given by \\boxed{ \\frac{dL}{dT} = c_{p2} - c_{p1} + \\frac{L}{T} - L \\cdot \\frac{v_2 \\alpha_2 - v_1 \\alpha_1}{v_2 - v_1} }.\n</think>"}
