Let me start by breaking this down step by step. First, I know that f(x) is defined as 2x - 3 and g(x) is x + 1. The problem is asking me to compute g of (f(5) - 1). \n\nLet me write down what I need to do. First, find f(5), then subtract 1 from that result, and then plug that into the function g. Let me start with calculating f(5). Since f(x) = 2x - 3, replacing x with 5 should give me 2*5 - 3. Let me compute that: 2 times 5 is 10, and then subtract 3 gives me 7. So f(5) equals 7. \n\nNow, the next step is to subtract 1 from this result. So 7 minus 1 is 6. Therefore, the argument inside the function g is 6. Now, I need to compute g(6). Since g(x) is x + 1, replacing x with 6 gives me 6 + 1, which is 7. Therefore, the value of g(f(5) - 1) should be 7. \n\nWait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step once more. \n\nFirst, f(5): 2*5 is 10, minus 3 is 7. Correct. Then subtract 1: 7 - 1 is 6. Then g(6): 6 + 1 is 7. Yes, that seems right. \n\nBut let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. The notation is g(f(5) - 1). Is there a possibility that someone might misinterpret this as g(f(5 - 1))? But no, according to the order of operations, the expression inside the parentheses is f(5) - 1, not f(5 - 1). So parentheses make it clear that we first compute f(5), subtract 1, and then apply g. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been g(f(5 - 1)), then we would first compute 5 - 1 = 4, then f(4), and then g of that. But that's not the case here. \n\nJust to double-check, let me compute both possibilities. First, the original problem: g(f(5) - 1). As above, f(5) is 7, subtract 1 is 6, g(6) is 7. \n\nIf it were g(f(5 - 1)) instead, then 5 - 1 is 4, f(4) is 2*4 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5, then g(5) is 5 + 1 = 6. But since the original problem is written as g(f(5) - 1), not g(f(5 - 1)), the first interpretation is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The value is 7. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me write out the entire process algebraically. \n\nFirst, f(5) = 2*5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7. \n\nThen, f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6. \n\nThen, g(f(5) - 1) = g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7. \n\nYes, that all checks out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of composing functions. But in this case, it's not a composition of f and g, but rather a modified input. Let me see. If I wanted to write this as a composition, maybe something like g(h(x)) where h(x) is f(x) - 1? But perhaps that's complicating things. \n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's a way to combine the functions first. For example, if I had to find g(f(x) - 1) in general, what would that be? Let's try that. \n\nGiven f(x) = 2x - 3, so f(x) - 1 = 2x - 3 - 1 = 2x - 4. Then, applying g to that, which is g(input) = input + 1. Therefore, g(f(x) - 1) = (2x - 4) + 1 = 2x - 3. Wait, that's interesting. So in general, g(f(x) - 1) equals 2x - 3? But that's the same as f(x). Is that correct? Let me check with x = 5. \n\nIf x = 5, then 2x - 3 is 10 - 3 = 7. Which matches our previous result. So in general, g(f(x) - 1) = f(x). That seems surprising, but let's verify with another value. Let me take x = 2. \n\nCompute f(2) = 2*2 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1. Then f(2) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0. Then g(0) = 0 + 1 = 1. Which is equal to f(2) = 1. So yes, it works here. \n\nAnother example: x = 0. f(0) = 2*0 - 3 = -3. Then f(0) - 1 = -3 -1 = -4. Then g(-4) = -4 + 1 = -3, which is f(0). So indeed, it seems that g(f(x) - 1) simplifies to f(x). \n\nTherefore, in general, g(f(x) - 1) = f(x). Therefore, for any x, this expression equals f(x). Therefore, for x = 5, it equals f(5) = 7, which is the answer. \n\nThat's a nice algebraic verification. So regardless of x, g(f(x) - 1) is equal to f(x). Therefore, the answer is 7. \n\nThis shows that even though the problem seems to involve two functions, through simplification, we find that it's just equal to f(x). Therefore, the value is 7. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the general case, I could have just followed the steps as I did initially, which also leads to the same answer. \n\nSo whether I approach it step by step or by general function composition, I arrive at the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 7. \n\nBut just to recap once more:\n\n1. Calculate f(5):\n   f(5) = 2*5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.\n\n2. Subtract 1:\n   7 - 1 = 6.\n\n3. Apply g to the result:\n   g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nAll steps are straightforward, and each operation is simple arithmetic. There's no ambiguity in the operations, and the functions are linear, so there's no hidden complexity here. \n\nAnother angle: maybe plugging into a composite function. If someone tried to make a composite function, like g(f(x)), that would be g(2x - 3) = (2x - 3) + 1 = 2x - 2. But that's not what's being asked here. The problem is g(f(5) - 1), which is different from g(f(5)) or g(f(x)). \n\nLet me compute g(f(5)) for comparison. If I did g(f(5)), that would be g(7) = 7 + 1 = 8. But the problem is g(f(5) - 1) which is g(6) = 7. So different result. \n\nTherefore, important to note the parentheses and the order. \n\nIn summary, after carefully checking each step, verifying with different methods (direct computation, general function simplification), and ensuring that there's no misinterpretation of the function composition, I can confirm that the correct answer is indeed 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ g(f(5)-1) $ is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>"}
