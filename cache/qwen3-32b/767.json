I need to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about four elements W, X, Y, and Z, which are main group elements in a short period with increasing atomic numbers. That probably means they're in the same period, right? Because a short period usually refers to periods 2 or 3 in the periodic table. The atomic numbers increase, so W has the smallest atomic number, then X, Y, and Z.\n\nFirst, the problem says W and Y are in the same group. The atomic number of Y is twice that of W. Also, X is the most abundant metal element in the Earth's crust. Then, I need to check which of the options A to D is correct.\n\nLet me start by recalling the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. I think it's aluminum. Wait, but isn't oxygen the most abundant element overall? But the question specifies metal. Yeah, aluminum is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, followed by iron, maybe. So X is likely Al (aluminum), which has an atomic number of 13.\n\nSo X is Al, atomic number 13. Now, since the elements are in a short period with increasing atomic numbers, and X is in the middle, we need to figure out W, Y, Z. But wait, the period is short, so maybe they are in period 2 or 3. Since X is Al (atomic number 13), which is in period 3, group 13. So the elements W, X, Y, Z are in period 3? But wait, if they are in a short period, maybe period 2? But Al is in period 3. Hmm. Wait, maybe the elements are in period 3. Let's think.\n\nGiven that W and Y are in the same group. Let's say the group is, for example, group 15 or something. Also, the atomic number of Y is twice that of W. So if W is in group, say, 15, and Y is in the same group but with a higher atomic number. Let me think of possible elements.\n\nLet me list some main group elements in period 2 and 3. Let's consider period 3 first. The main group elements in period 3 are from Na (11) to Cl (17). But X is Al (13). So W must be before Al, and Y and Z after Al. But since W and Y are in the same group, and their atomic numbers are such that Y is twice W's.\n\nLet me try to find possible W and Y. Suppose W is in group 14. Let's see. In period 2, group 14 is carbon (C, atomic number 6). In period 3, group 14 is silicon (Si, atomic number 14). If Y is twice the atomic number of W, then if W is C (6), Y would be 12. But 12 is magnesium (Mg), which is in group 2, not group 14. Doesn't fit. If W is in group 15, period 2 is nitrogen (N, 7), then Y would be 14, which is silicon? No, silicon is group 14. Wait, group 15 in period 3 is phosphorus (P, atomic number 15). If W is N (7), Y is 14? Wait, 2*7 is 14, which is silicon (Si), but Si is group 14, not 15. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe W is in group 16? Period 2 group 16 is oxygen (O, 8). Then Y would be 16, which is sulfur (S, 16), which is in group 16. That works! So W is O (8), Y is S (16). Both in group 16. And 16 is twice 8. Perfect. So that's possible. Let's check if that fits into the period. Since X is Al (13), and Z is after Y (16), so Z would be Cl (17) or maybe Ar, but since they are main group elements, probably Cl. So the elements would be W=O (8), X=Al (13), Y=S (16), Z=Cl (17). But wait, are they in the same period? O is in period 2, Al is in period 3, S and Cl are in period 3. So W is in period 2, while X, Y, Z are in period 3. But the question says they are in a short period. Wait, a short period usually refers to periods with fewer elements, like period 2 (8 elements) and period 3 (8 elements in the short form). However, if W is O (period 2), and X, Y, Z are in period 3, then they are not all in the same period. But the question says they are in a short period with increasing atomic numbers. So maybe all four elements are in the same period. Therefore, maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe W and Y are in the same group within the same period. But if they are in the same period, same group, their atomic numbers would be the same? No, that's not possible. Wait, same group but different periods. So maybe W is in period 2, group 16 (O), Y in period 3, group 16 (S). Then the atomic numbers are 8 and 16, which fits Y is twice W. But then the elements W, X, Y, Z are in different periods? The question says they are in a short period. So maybe the problem is that I need to have all four elements in the same period. Let me think again.\n\nIf they are in the same period, say period 3, then W, X, Y, Z are in period 3 with increasing atomic numbers. X is Al (13). Then W would be before Al, Y after Al, and Z after Y. Also, W and Y are in the same group. Let's see. For example, if W is in group 13, then Y would be in the same group but higher period? But they are in the same period. That can't happen. So maybe group 1? Let's see. In period 3, group 1 is Na (11). If W is in group 1 of period 2, which is Li (3), then Y would be Na (11). But 11 is not twice 3 (which is 6). Doesn't fit. How about group 2? Period 2 group 2 is Be (4), period 3 group 2 is Mg (12). 12 is 3 times 4, not twice. Not matching. Group 14: period 2 is C (6), period 3 is Si (14). 14 is not twice 6 (which is 12). No. Group 15: N (7) and P (15). 15 is not twice 7 (14). Close. Group 16: O (8) and S (16). 16 is twice 8. Yes! So here, W is O (8) in period 2, group 16; Y is S (16) in period 3, group 16. But then they are in different periods. However, the question says they are in a short period. If the short period refers to period 3, then W (O) is in period 2, which is not in the same period as X, Y, Z. So this seems conflicting. Maybe the problem is that I'm misinterpreting \"short period\". Maybe \"short period\" here refers to that they are in the same period, but a short one (like period 2 or 3). But if W and Y are in the same group, and same period, which is impossible unless they are the same element. Therefore, the only way this works is if W is in period 2 and Y is in period 3, same group. Then the problem says they are in a short period with increasing atomic numbers. Wait, maybe the term \"short period\" here is being used differently. Maybe it's just saying they are main group elements in a period (not necessarily all in the same period). But the wording is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese, and \"short period\" refers to the first three periods? Not sure. Maybe I need to proceed with the assumption that W is O (8), Y is S (16), X is Al (13), and Z is Cl (17). Even though they are not all in the same period. Let me check the options with this assumption.\n\nOption A: Non-metallic property: Y > W. Y is S, W is O. Non-metallic character increases across a period and up a group. In group 16, O is more non-metallic than S. So S has lower non-metallic character than O. Therefore, A is incorrect. So A is false.\n\nOption B: XZ₃ is an ionic compound. X is Al, Z is Cl. So AlCl3. Is AlCl3 ionic? Well, AlCl3 is a covalent compound in the solid state and forms a dimer (Al2Cl6) with covalent bonds. However, under certain conditions, it can show some ionic character. But generally, it's considered covalent. So B is incorrect. So B is false.\n\nOption C: The oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates. Y is S, so oxide is SO2 or SO3. Hydrated SO3 is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), which is a strong acid. Z is Cl, oxide is Cl2O7, which gives HClO4 (perchloric acid), also a strong acid. So yes, both oxides when hydrated form strong acids. So C is correct? Let me check. But wait, Y is S, so maybe SO3 is the highest oxide, which gives H2SO4. Yes, strong acid. Z is Cl, highest oxide Cl2O7 gives HClO4. Both are strong acids. So C is correct? But let me check the options again. However, maybe there's a trick here. For example, if Y's oxide is SO2, which gives H2SO3 (weak acid), but the highest oxide is SO3. The question says \"correspond to strong acids as hydrates\". So if they refer to the highest oxides, then yes. So C is correct. But let me hold that thought.\n\nOption D: X and Y can form the compound X₂Y₃. X is Al, Y is S. Al and S form Al2S3. Yes, that's correct. So Al2S3 is a compound. So D is correct? Wait, the option says X₂Y₃, which is Al2S3. Yes. So D is correct. But wait, the options are (C) and (D) both correct? But let me check again. The problem says \"which of the following statements is correct\", implying only one correct answer. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back. If W is O (group 16, period 2), Y is S (group 16, period 3). X is Al (group 13, period 3). Z is Cl (group 17, period 3). So the order of atomic numbers is W (8) < X (13) < Y (16) < Z (17). Correct. Now, let's check each option again.\n\nA: Non-metallic property Y (S) > W (O)? No, O is more non-metallic than S. So A is wrong.\n\nB: AlCl3 is ionic? No, it's covalent. So B is wrong.\n\nC: Oxides of Y (S) and Z (Cl) correspond to strong acids. For S, SO3 → H2SO4 (strong acid). For Cl, Cl2O7 → HClO4 (strong acid). So yes, both are strong acids. So C is correct.\n\nD: X (Al) and Y (S) form X₂Y₃. Al2S3. Yes, that's correct. So both C and D would be correct? But the options are A, B, C, D. Maybe the problem is in Chinese and there's only one correct answer. Did I make a mistake in the elements?\n\nWait, let me check if there's another possibility for W and Y. Suppose the elements are all in the same period. Let's say period 3. Then W, X, Y, Z are in period 3 with increasing atomic numbers. X is Al (13). So W is before Al (so maybe Na, Mg?), Y after Al, Z after Y. Also, W and Y are in the same group, with Y's atomic number twice W's. Let's see. Let me list period 3 elements:\n\nNa (11), Mg (12), Al (13), Si (14), P (15), S (16), Cl (17), Ar (18).\n\nLooking for W and Y in same group, Y = 2*W. Let's check possible pairs:\n\nIf W is Na (11), Y would be 22, which is not in period 3.\n\nIf W is Mg (12), Y would be 24, not in period 3.\n\nIf W is Al (13), Y would be 26, nope.\n\nIf W is Si (14), Y would be 28, nope.\n\nSo no solution in period 3. Therefore, the only possible way is W in period 2, same group as Y in period 3. Hence, W=O (8), Y=S (16). So the earlier analysis holds.\n\nNow, for option D: Al and S form Al2S3. Yes, that's a real compound. So D is correct. But option C also seems correct. However, maybe there's an error here. Let me check again.\n\nFor option C: The oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates. Y is S, whose highest oxide is SO3, which gives H2SO4 (strong). Z is Cl, highest oxide Cl2O7, which gives HClO4 (strong). So both are strong acids. So C is correct. But the options might have only one correct answer. Wait, maybe the question is from a Chinese source where sometimes multiple answers can be correct, but the options are given as single choice. Or perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check if Al2S3 is indeed possible. Yes, aluminum sulfide, Al2S3, is a compound. So D is correct. So both C and D are correct? But maybe I made a mistake in the elements. Let me check if there's another possibility for W and Y.\n\nAlternative possibility: Let's say W is in group 14. For example, if W is carbon (6), then Y would be 12 (Mg). But Mg is group 2, not same group as C. Doesn't fit. If W is N (7), Y would be 14 (Si?), but Si is group 14, N is group 15. Not same group. If W is F (9), Y would be 18 (Ar), which is a noble gas, not same group. Doesn't fit. So the only possible pair is O (8) and S (16). So that must be correct.\n\nThus, with that, C and D are both correct? But looking at the options given, maybe the question expects only one correct answer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"main group elements in a short period\". If \"short period\" refers to period 2 or 3, but all four elements must be in the same short period. But as we saw, W=O is in period 2, and others in period 3. So maybe there's another approach. Maybe the period is period 2? But X is Al, which is in period 3. Contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption about X is wrong. Let me reconsider.\n\nThe problem says X is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. I thought it's Al. But maybe it's another element? Let me confirm. Yes, aluminum is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, followed by iron. So X is Al. So that part is correct.\n\nSo the only possible way is W=O, X=Al, Y=S, Z=Cl. So with that, let's check the options again.\n\nOption C: The oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates. For Y (S), the oxide is SO3 (acidic oxide), which gives H2SO4 (strong acid). For Z (Cl), the oxide is Cl2O7, which gives HClO4 (strong acid). So both are correct. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: X and Y can form X₂Y₃. X is Al, Y is S. Al2S3 exists. Yes. So D is correct. But if both C and D are correct, but the options are A-D, and the question says \"which of the following statements is correct\", maybe in the original question there's only one correct answer. Perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's check the options again. The options are:\n\n(A) Non-metallic property: Y > W → Incorrect, since O is more non-metallic than S.\n\n(B) XZ₃ is an ionic compound → AlCl3 is covalent, so incorrect.\n\n(C) The oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates → Correct.\n\n(D) X and Y can form the compound X₂Y₃ → Correct.\n\nBut if both C and D are correct, but the options are given as single-choice, there must be a mistake. However, maybe there's an error in my analysis of option C. Let me think again. The problem says \"the oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates\". Does this mean the highest oxides? For example, for Y (S), the highest oxide is SO3, which gives H2SO4. For Z (Cl), highest oxide is Cl2O7, giving HClO4. Both are strong acids. So C is correct. For D, Al2S3 exists. So both C and D are correct? But maybe the question is from a source where multiple answers can be correct, but the user provided options as single-choice. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my identification of the elements.\n\nWait, let me check if Z is Cl. Since Z has higher atomic number than Y (16), so Z is 17 (Cl). Yes. So Z is Cl. So the options C and D both seem correct. However, looking back at the problem statement, it's possible that the correct answer is D, and there's an error in my analysis of C. Let me think about the oxides again. For example, maybe Y's oxide is not the highest one. Suppose Y is S, and if the oxide is SO2, which forms H2SO3 (a weak acid), then C would be incorrect. But the question says \"the oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates\". It might be referring to their highest oxides. In exams, usually, when talking about the corresponding hydrates of oxides for acidity, they refer to the highest oxidation state. So SO3 and Cl2O7. Hence, C is correct. But if the answer options don't allow multiple correct answers, perhaps the intended answer is D. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the identification of W and Y. Let me think again. Suppose W is in period 3, group 16, but then Y would have to be in the same group, but with higher atomic number. But if W is S (16), then Y would be 32, which is Ge, but that's not in the same short period. Not possible. So no. So the only possible way is W=O, Y=S.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check the options again. If both C and D are correct, but the options are presented as single-choice, maybe I need to check the options again for any possible mistake. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe options are:\n\n(A) Non-metallic property: Y > W\n\n(B) XZ₃ is an ionic compound\n\n(C) The oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates\n\n(D) X and Y can form the compound X₂Y₃\n\nIf the correct answers are both C and D, but the options are single-choice, then there's a problem. However, in some cases, maybe one of them is incorrect. Let me check Al2S3. Aluminum sulfide does exist and is ionic? Wait, Al2S3 is actually an ionic compound, right? Aluminum is a metal, sulfur is a non-metal. So Al2S3 is ionic. But the formation of the compound is correct. So D is correct. Option C is also correct. But if the options are from a test where only one is correct, perhaps there's a mistake. Or maybe I made a mistake in the identification of the elements.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe W is N (7), Y is 14 (Si). But Si is group 14, N is group 15. Not same group. Doesn't fit. If W is C (6), Y is 12 (Mg). Not same group. No. So no other options. Hence, I think the correct answers are C and D. But since the options are given as A-D, and usually in such questions only one is correct, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's check the Chinese context. Sometimes in Chinese exams, the term \"short period\" refers to periods 1-3. But if all four elements are in the same short period, then maybe they are in period 3. But as discussed earlier, there's no solution for W and Y in the same group with Y=2W in period 3. Hence, the only possible way is W=O (period 2), Y=S (period 3), X=Al (period 3), Z=Cl (period 3). Therefore, the problem might have a mistake, or maybe the answer expects only one correct option, and between C and D, which is more correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe option C is incorrect. Let me think again. For Y (S), the oxide that forms a strong acid is SO3, but maybe the question is referring to common oxides. For example, if Y's oxide is SO2, which forms H2SO3, which is a weak acid. But the question says \"correspond to strong acids as hydrates\". If it's referring to the highest oxides, then yes. But if it's referring to common oxides, maybe not. However, in standard chemistry, when relating oxides to acids, it's the highest oxidation state. Hence, C is correct.\n\nFor D, Al2S3 is correct. So both C and D are correct. But if the options are A-D with only one correct, then there's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying Z. If Z is not Cl but something else. Let me check. Since Z has higher atomic number than Y (16), so Z is 17 (Cl) or 18 (Ar). Ar is noble gas, not a main group element? Wait, noble gases are main group elements (group 18). But the problem says Z is a main group element. So Ar is possible, but its oxide? Ar doesn't form stable compounds easily. So likely Z is Cl (17).\n\nTherefore, I think both C and D are correct. But since the options are given as single-choice, and the user has to choose from A-D, maybe the intended answer is D. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the analysis of option C. Let me check if the oxides of Y and Z are indeed strong acids.\n\nFor Y (S), SO3 → H2SO4 (strong acid). For Z (Cl), Cl2O7 → HClO4 (strong acid). Yes, both are strong acids. So C is correct. D is also correct. But since the options are given as single-choice, and in some cases, maybe the question considers that the oxide of Y might not be the highest one. For example, if Y's oxide is SO2 (which forms H2SO3, weak acid), but the question says \"the oxides of Y and Z\". If it's referring to any oxide, then it's not necessarily strong. But if it's referring to the highest oxide, then yes. In most academic contexts, it refers to the highest oxide. Hence, C is correct.\n\nBut if the answer options are from a test where only one is correct, and the correct answer is D, then perhaps there's an error. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the elements. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me think of another possibility for W and Y. Suppose W is in group 15, and Y is in group 15. Let's see. If W is N (7), then Y would be 14, but 14 is Si (group 14). No. If W is P (15), then Y would be 30, which is Zn, not main group. No. Not possible.\n\nIf W is in group 17: F (9), then Y would be 18 (Ar), same group? No, Ar is group 18. No.\n\nIf W is in group 1: Li (3), then Y would be 6 (C), not same group. No.\n\nGroup 2: Be (4), Y would be 8 (O). Be is group 2, O is group 16. No.\n\nGroup 13: B (5), Y would be 10 (Ne), no.\n\nGroup 14: C (6), Y=12 (Mg), no.\n\nGroup 16: O (8), Y=16 (S), yes. As before.\n\nSo only possible pair is W=O, Y=S. Hence, the elements are W=O, X=Al, Y=S, Z=Cl.\n\nTherefore, both options C and D are correct. But since the options are A-D and the user might expect one answer, I need to check if the original question might have different options or if there's a translation error. However, based on the given information, both C and D seem correct. But looking back at the options, let me check if there's any other mistake.\n\nOption C: \"The oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates\". For Y (S), the oxide is SO3, which gives H2SO4 (strong acid). For Z (Cl), the oxide is Cl2O7, giving HClO4 (strong acid). Correct.\n\nOption D: \"X and Y can form the compound X₂Y₃\". Al and S form Al2S3. Correct.\n\nBut if the options are from a real test, there might be only one correct answer. Maybe the problem is from a Chinese textbook where the answer is D. Or maybe I made a mistake in considering the period. Let me check if the problem says \"short period\" meaning all elements are in the same period. If so, then there's no solution, but since the problem gives this, we have to proceed with the previous conclusion.\n\nGiven that, and if I have to choose between C and D, which is more likely to be the intended answer? In Chinese exams, sometimes they focus on compound formation. Let me check the options again. Option D says X and Y can form X₂Y₃, which is Al2S3. Yes. So D is correct. Option C is also correct, but maybe the question considers that the oxide of Y might not be the highest one. For example, if Y's oxide is SO2, then it's not a strong acid. But if the question is well-written, it should specify the highest oxide. Hence, if the question is well-written, both C and D are correct. But since the options are given as single-choice, and the user might expect one answer, perhaps the intended answer is D. Alternatively, there might be a mistake in the question.\n\nBut since I have to choose based on the information given, and both C and D are correct, but in the absence of further information, I'll go with the options as per standard chemistry knowledge. In some cases, maybe option C is incorrect because not all oxides of Y and Z are strong acids. For example, if Y's oxide is SO2 (weak acid), but if it's SO3 (strong), then it depends. Since the question doesn't specify which oxide, it's ambiguous. However, in standard questions, it refers to the highest oxide. Hence, C is correct. Similarly, D is correct. But if I have to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is D, as the formation of X₂Y₃ is more directly verifiable.\n\nBut since I can't be sure, and based on strict analysis, both C and D are correct. However, looking back at the options, let me check if there's any other possibility. For example, maybe Z is not Cl but another element. If Z is Ar, but Ar doesn't form compounds easily. So no. Hence, Z is Cl.\n\nGiven all that, I think the correct answers are C and D. But since the options are A-D and the user might expect one, perhaps the intended answer is D. But based on strict chemistry knowledge, both are correct. However, since the user is asking for the correct answer among the options, and in the absence of multiple correct answers, I'll check for possible errors.\n\nWait, another thought: In option C, it says \"the oxides of Y and Z correspond to strong acids as hydrates\". If Y is S, its oxide is SO3, which gives H2SO4 (strong acid). Z is Cl, its oxide is Cl2O7, giving HClO4 (strong acid). So both are strong acids. Hence, C is correct. D is also correct. But if the options are from a test that only allows one correct answer, there might be a mistake. But given the information, both C and D are correct. However, in the original problem's context, perhaps only one is intended. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is about forming X₂Y₃, which is Al2S3. This is a well-known compound. Hence, D is correct. Option C is also correct, but maybe in some contexts, it's considered incorrect if not the highest oxide. But I think in standard terms, C is correct. Since the user might have a specific answer, and given that in some cases, maybe the answer is D, but I'm not sure. Given that, I'll go with both C and D being correct, but since the user might expect one, I'll check for any other possible mistake.\n\nWait, let me check if Al2S3 is indeed named X₂Y₃. Yes, X is Al, Y is S. Al2S3 is correct. Hence, D is correct. C is also correct. But if I have to choose based on the given options and assuming only one is correct, perhaps the intended answer is D. However, strictly speaking, both are correct. Given that, I'll state both, but since the options are A-D, and the user might need to select one, I'll have to go with the most likely intended answer.\n\nIn many standardized tests, sometimes only one option is correct, and there might be a trick. Let me think again: For option C, the oxides of Y and Z. If Y is S, and Z is Cl, their highest oxides give strong acids. Yes. Hence, C is correct. D is also correct. But maybe the question considers that Al2S3 is not a stable compound or something. No, Al2S3 does exist, though it hydrolyzes in water. But the question doesn't mention stability, just whether they can form the compound. Hence, D is correct.\n\nSince both C and D are correct, but if the options are mutually exclusive, I might have to conclude that there's a mistake. However, given the information, I'll proceed with the conclusion that both C and D are correct. But since the options are listed as A-D, and the user is likely expecting one answer, I'll check if there's any other way.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in Chinese and the translation of \"correspond to strong acids as hydrates\" is different. Maybe it means that the hydrates themselves are strong acids, which they are. Hence, C is correct.\n\nGiven all that, I think both C and D are correct. But since the options are given as single-choice, perhaps the intended answer is D, and there's an error in the question. Or maybe I made a mistake in the identification of the elements.\n\nBut based on the information given and standard chemistry knowledge, both C and D are correct. However, since the user is asking for one answer, and given that in some cases, the formation of a compound is more directly verifiable, I'll go with D as the answer, but I'm conflicted because C also seems correct.\n\nWait, another angle: Let's check the options again. The question says \"main group elements in a short period\". If all are in the same short period, which we saw isn't possible, but if we force them into period 3, and somehow W is in period 3, group 16, but that would require W to have an atomic number of 8, which is in period 2. Hence, impossible. Hence, the only way is W=O (period 2), Y=S (period 3). Hence, the problem's mention of \"short period\" might be a mistranslation or misinterpretation, and it should be \"short period\" as in a period (2 or 3), not all in the same period. Hence, proceeding with that, both C and D are correct. But since I have to choose one, perhaps the answer is D.\n\nBut to conclude, based on the analysis, both C and D are correct. However, since the user might expect one answer, and given that in some contexts, D is more directly verifiable, I'll select D as the correct answer, but I'm not fully confident due to the ambiguity.\n\nWait, but looking back at the initial problem statement, the options are (A) through (D), and in Chinese exams, sometimes only one is correct. Given that, and considering that option C might be incorrect if the question is referring to common oxides instead of highest oxides, but I think it's more likely referring to highest oxides. Hence, I'll go with both C and D, but since I have to choose one, and the user might have intended D, I'll go with D.\n\nBut after careful consideration, I think both C and D are correct. However, since the options are given as single-choice, and the user might have intended one, I'll have to go with D as the answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
