Let me start by recalling what a half-life is. From what I remember, a half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive isotope to decay. So each half-life reduces the quantity of the isotope by half.\n\nLet me think step by step. Let's say we start with 100% of the isotope. After one half-life, half of it would have decayed, so 50% remains. Then, after the second half-life, half of the remaining 50% would decay, so that's 25% left. Then, the third half-life would take half of that 25%, which would leave 12.5% of the original isotope. \n\nSo after three half-lives, the remaining amount is 12.5%. That would mean that 100% - 12.5% = 87.5% has decayed. So looking at the options:\n\nA: 25% left – that's after two half-lives, not three. So A is incorrect.\n\nB: 25% decayed – but if 25% is left, then 75% decayed, so B is also incorrect.\n\nC: 12.5% left – that matches my calculation, so C might be correct.\n\nD: 12.5% decayed – no, that's way too low, since 87.5% would have decayed, so D is incorrect.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the percentages. Let me verify again.\n\nStarting with 100%:\n\n1st half-life: 50% left, 50% decayed.\n\n2nd half-life: 25% left, 75% decayed.\n\n3rd half-life: 12.5% left, 87.5% decayed.\n\nYes, so after three half-lives, the remaining is 12.5%, which is option C. The other options don't match. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut let me check if there's any trick here. For example, sometimes people might confuse the percentage left with the percentage decayed. But in the options, A and C are about what's left, B and D about what decayed. Since the question says \"three half-lives after an isotope is prepared,\" the correct remaining is 12.5%, so C is correct. The decayed percentage would be 87.5%, so none of the options B or D are correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
