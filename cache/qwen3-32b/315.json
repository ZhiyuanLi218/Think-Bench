The expression is **zero** when:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 81 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\pm9.\n$$\n\nSo, the numerator is:\n- **Zero at $ x = -9 $ and $ x = 9 $**,\n- **Positive elsewhere**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Denominator\n\nThe denominator is:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\n$$\n\nThis is a quadratic expression with **roots at $ x = 0 $ and $ x = 36 $**. The sign of the expression depends on the interval:\n\n- For $ x < 0 $: both factors are negative → product is **positive**.\n- For $ 0 < x < 36 $: one factor positive, one negative → product is **negative**.\n- For $ x > 36 $: both factors are positive → product is **positive**.\n\nSo, the denominator is **negative** on the open interval $ (0, 36) $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Combine Conditions\n\nWe are looking for when the **entire fraction is negative**. Since the numerator is always **non-negative**, the fraction is negative **only when the denominator is negative and the numerator is positive**.\n\nThus, we must find the values of $ x $ such that:\n1. The denominator is negative: $ x \\in (0, 36) $,\n2. The numerator is **not zero**, which excludes $ x = 9 $ (since $ x = -9 $ is not in the interval $ (0, 36) $).\n\nSo the solution set is:\n\n$$\n(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36).\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Exclude Undefined Points\n\nThe original expression is undefined when the denominator is zero, which occurs at $ x = 0 $ and $ x = 36 $. These are already excluded in the open interval $ (0, 36) $, so no further exclusions are needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this inequality: $\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0$. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that absolute value expressions are always non-negative, right? So the numerator here, $|x^2 - 81|$, is always greater than or equal to zero. The denominator is $x^2 - 36x$. The inequality is asking when this fraction is less than zero, which means negative. \n\nSince the numerator is an absolute value, it's either positive or zero. The denominator must then be responsible for making the whole fraction negative. But wait, if the numerator is non-negative and the denominator is negative, then the whole fraction would be non-positive. However, if the numerator is zero, then the whole fraction would be zero, which is not less than zero. So, the inequality will hold when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative. \n\nSo, my plan is to find the values of x where the numerator is positive (i.e., not zero) and the denominator is negative. Let me write that down:\n\nFirst, find where $|x^2 - 81| > 0$. That happens when $x^2 - 81 \\neq 0$, so $x \\neq 9$ and $x \\neq -9$. \n\nSecond, find where the denominator $x^2 - 36x < 0$. Let me solve that inequality. \n\nLet me factor the denominator: $x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)$. So, the critical points are at x = 0 and x = 36. To determine where the expression is negative, I can use a sign chart. \n\nThe quadratic $x(x - 36)$ is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of x² is positive) with roots at 0 and 36. Therefore, it will be negative between the roots. So, the denominator is negative when x is between 0 and 36. \n\nTherefore, the denominator is negative for $0 < x < 36$. \n\nNow, combining this with the numerator condition, which excludes x = 9 and x = -9. However, since the denominator is negative only between 0 and 36, and -9 is outside of that interval, maybe I don't have to worry about x = -9 here? Wait, let me check. \n\nThe numerator $|x^2 - 81|$ is zero at x = 9 and x = -9. But the denominator is negative only between 0 and 36. So, x = -9 is not in the interval where the denominator is negative, so even though the numerator is zero there, it doesn't affect the solution set. However, x = 9 is within the interval 0 to 36. Therefore, at x = 9, the numerator is zero, making the whole fraction zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. Therefore, we need to exclude x = 9 from the interval where the denominator is negative. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the solution set is the interval where denominator is negative (0 < x < 36) minus the points where the numerator is zero (which in this interval is only x = 9). \n\nBut also, we need to consider the domain of the original expression. The denominator cannot be zero. The denominator is zero when x = 0 or x = 36. Therefore, we must exclude x = 0 and x = 36 from the domain. However, since we already have the interval 0 < x < 36, those endpoints are already excluded. \n\nTherefore, the solution set is (0, 9) union (9, 36). \n\nWait, let me check again. Let me verify with some test points. Let me pick x = 1, which is in (0, 9). Let me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: |1 - 81| = | -80 | = 80. Denominator: 1 - 36(1) = 1 - 36 = -35. So the fraction is 80 / (-35) = -80/35 < 0. So that works. \n\nNow, x = 10, which is in (9, 36). Numerator: |100 - 81| = |19| = 19. Denominator: 100 - 360 = -260. So 19 / (-260) is negative. Also works. \n\nWhat about x = -10, which is less than 0. Let me check if it's allowed. The denominator here would be (-10)^2 - 36*(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460. So denominator is positive. The numerator is |100 - 81| = 19. So the fraction is 19/460 > 0, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So x < 0 is not part of the solution. \n\nWhat about x = 40? Denominator is 1600 - 1440 = 160. Positive. Numerator is |1600 - 81| = 1519. So positive over positive is positive. Doesn't satisfy. \n\nx = 0 and x = 36 are excluded because denominator is zero. \n\nx = 9: numerator is zero, denominator is 81 - 324 = -243. So fraction is 0 / (-243) = 0, which is not less than zero. So x = 9 is excluded. \n\nSimilarly, x = -9: numerator is zero, denominator is 81 - (-324) = 81 + 324 = 405. So 0 / 405 = 0, which is not less than zero. But since x = -9 is not in the interval where denominator is negative, it's not part of the solution set anyway. \n\nTherefore, the solution is all real numbers between 0 and 36, except x = 9. \n\nBut let me check if there are any other points where the denominator is zero or numerator is zero. The denominator is zero at 0 and 36, which are already excluded. The numerator is zero at 9 and -9. Only 9 is in the interval (0, 36). \n\nTherefore, the solution set is (0, 9) union (9, 36). \n\nWait, but let me also check if there are any other restrictions. For example, when dealing with inequalities, sometimes you have to consider the sign changes. Let me make sure that in the interval (0, 9) and (9, 36), the denominator remains negative. \n\nWe already factored the denominator as x(x - 36). In the interval (0, 9), x is positive, and (x - 36) is negative (since x < 36). So positive times negative is negative. In the interval (9, 36), same thing: x positive, (x - 36) negative. So denominator is negative in both intervals. \n\nTherefore, the entire interval 0 < x < 36, except x = 9, is the solution. \n\nBut let me also check if there's a case where the absolute value could be zero. Since |x² - 81| is zero at x = ±9, but as discussed, only x = 9 is in the interval. \n\nTherefore, the answer is x in (0, 9) union (9, 36). \n\nBut let me write it in interval notation. So, (0, 9) ∪ (9, 36). \n\nWait, let me check once more. Let me think if there is a case where |x² - 81| is positive but denominator is negative. Since we already considered that. \n\nAnother way to approach this inequality is to note that since the absolute value is always non-negative, the fraction is negative only when the denominator is negative and the numerator is not zero. Therefore, solving denominator < 0 and numerator ≠ 0. \n\nWhich is exactly what I did. \n\nSo solving denominator < 0 gives 0 < x < 36. Then, numerator is zero when x² - 81 = 0, so x = ±9. Therefore, in the interval 0 < x < 36, we need to exclude x = 9. \n\nTherefore, solution is 0 < x < 9 or 9 < x < 36. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is (0, 9) ∪ (9, 36). \n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, suppose someone might think that absolute value could complicate things, but since it's in the numerator and always non-negative, the sign of the fraction depends only on the denominator. Except when numerator is zero, which makes it zero. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, if I try to write the inequality:\n\n$\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0$\n\nSince |x² - 81| ≥ 0, and the denominator is x(x - 36). \n\nTherefore, the inequality holds when denominator is negative and numerator is not zero. \n\nTherefore, same conclusion. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider cases where the expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative. But maybe that's overcomplicating. \n\nBut let me try. \n\n|x² - 81| is equal to x² - 81 when x² - 81 ≥ 0, which is when x ≤ -9 or x ≥ 9. And it's equal to -(x² - 81) when -9 < x < 9. \n\nBut since our denominator is negative only between 0 and 36, maybe we can combine these. \n\nSo, for the interval 0 < x < 36, which is where the denominator is negative. \n\nWithin this interval, let's split into two cases: \n\nCase 1: -9 < x < 9. But since we are in 0 < x < 36, the overlap is 0 < x < 9. In this case, |x² - 81| = -(x² - 81) = -x² + 81. \n\nCase 2: x ≥ 9 or x ≤ -9. Within 0 < x < 36, this is 9 ≤ x < 36. Here, |x² - 81| = x² - 81. \n\nSo in both cases, the numerator is positive (except at x = 9 where it is zero). Therefore, in both intervals 0 < x < 9 and 9 < x < 36, the numerator is positive and denominator is negative, so the fraction is negative. \n\nAt x = 9, numerator is zero, so fraction is zero. \n\nTherefore, same conclusion. \n\nSo the solution is indeed 0 < x < 9 or 9 < x < 36. \n\nTherefore, in interval notation: (0, 9) ∪ (9, 36). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there is any other critical points or something I missed. \n\nFor example, the original inequality: $\\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0$. \n\nWe need to make sure that x ≠ 0 and x ≠ 36, which is already considered. Also, x ≠ 9. \n\nTherefore, the answer is as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe graphing the function would help. The numerator |x² - 81| is a V-shaped graph at x = ±9, and the denominator is a parabola. But since I can't graph here, I'll rely on algebra. \n\nAnother check: Let me consider x approaching 0 from the right. Let x approach 0+, numerator approaches |0 - 81| = 81, denominator approaches 0 - 0 = 0. But since x is approaching 0 from the right, denominator approaches 0 from the negative side (since 0 < x < 36 makes denominator negative). Therefore, the fraction approaches -infty? Wait, no. Wait, numerator approaches 81, denominator approaches 0 from the negative side. Therefore, the whole fraction approaches -infty. But our inequality is looking for where it's negative. So near 0, it's very negative. Similarly, as x approaches 36 from the left, denominator approaches 36*(36 - 36) = 0, from the negative side (since x < 36, x - 36 is negative). So denominator approaches 0 from negative, numerator approaches |36² - 81| = |1296 - 81| = 1215. Therefore, fraction approaches -infty. \n\nAt x approaching 9 from left, numerator approaches |81 - 81| = 0, denominator approaches 9*(9 - 36) = 9*(-27) = -243. So the fraction approaches 0 from the negative side. Similarly, approaching 9 from the right, numerator approaches 0, denominator approaches same -243, so fraction approaches 0 from negative side. But at x = 9, it's exactly zero. \n\nTherefore, the function is negative throughout (0, 9) and (9, 36). \n\nTherefore, the solution set is correct. \n\nI think I've checked all possibilities. So I think the answer is (0, 9) union (9, 36). \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution to the inequality is \\boxed{(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)}.\n</think>"}
