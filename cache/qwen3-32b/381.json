This process is governed by several conservation laws, including **conservation of energy**, **momentum**, and **charge**.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Each Option:\n\n#### **Option A**:\n> *Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron.*\n\nThis is **incorrect**. In particle physics, **mass is not conserved** in the same way as energy or momentum. Instead, **energy and momentum** are conserved. The total **rest mass energy** (via $E = mc^2$) of the system is conserved, but this can be distributed among the resulting particles in various forms, such as kinetic energy or the creation of other particles. Moreover, the production of a **single new particle** with the combined mass of the electron and positron is not feasible due to **conservation of momentum** and the nature of the annihilation process.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option B**:\n> *Conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge.*\n\nThis is **partially misleading**. While it is true that the **total charge** of the system must remain zero (since the electron has a charge of -1 and the positron has +1), this does **not necessarily mean** that all new particles must be neutral. The **conservation of charge** only requires that the **net charge** is zero, not that each individual particle is neutral. For example, if a particle with +1 and another with -1 were created, that would still conserve charge. However, in **low-energy** electron-positron annihilation (which is the case here), the most likely outcome is the production of **neutral photons**, due to **energy constraints**. But the **reasoning** in Option B is based only on charge conservation, which **does not enforce** that all particles must be neutral. So this option is **not strictly correct**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option C**:\n> *Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.*\n\nThis is **correct**. In the **center-of-mass frame**, where the electron and positron are at rest (or nearly so), the initial **total momentum is zero**. Therefore, the **final momentum must also be zero**. If only one photon were produced, it would carry away momentum in a particular direction, violating conservation of momentum. However, if **two photons** are produced and move in **opposite directions**, their momenta will cancel out, preserving the total momentum. Additionally, because the system is symmetric (electron and positron have equal mass and opposite charges), the two gamma rays will have **equal energy** and move in **opposite directions**, making them \"identical\" in this context.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option D**:\n> *Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.*\n\nThis is **incorrect**. **Both the positron and the electron** must annihilate in the process. If only the positron were to annihilate and the electron remained, the system would have a net charge of -1, which violates **conservation of charge**. Moreover, the **total energy** of the system includes the rest mass energy of **both** particles, and both must be accounted for in the final state. So the electron cannot remain if the positron is annihilated.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe only option that is **both physically and logically correct** is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D is correct regarding what happens when a slow-moving positron interacts with a stationary electron. Let me start by recalling what I know about electron-positron interactions.\n\nFirst, a positron is the antimatter counterpart of an electron. When they meet, they can annihilate each other. Annihilation typically results in the production of gamma-ray photons. But the specifics depend on the energy involved. Since the positron is very slow-moving, its kinetic energy is low, so the annihilation should be in the low-energy regime.\n\nNow, let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: \"Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron.\"\n\nHmm. Well, in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they don't just convert their mass into energy directly. Instead, energy, momentum, and charge must be conserved. Also, mass isn't conserved in the same way as energy. The total energy (including rest mass energy) is conserved, but individual masses can change. So if a single new particle were created, its mass would need to account for the total energy, but since the positron and electron are annihilating, it's more likely they convert into photons or other particles. But creating a single new particle with mass equal to the sum of the electron and positron masses might not be possible because of conservation of momentum. Also, if they annihilate, they usually produce two photons to conserve momentum (since a single photon can't carry away the momentum in all directions). So creating a single particle might not be feasible unless it's something else. But I'm not sure if this is possible. Let me hold on that.\n\nOption B: \"Conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge.\"\n\nOriginal charges: electron is -1, positron is +1. Total charge is 0. So any new particles must have a total charge of 0. So if they produce neutral particles, that's okay. But could they produce charged particles as long as their total charge is zero? For example, maybe two particles with +1 and -1 charges. But in the case of electron-positron annihilation, the usual outcome is gamma rays, which are neutral. So B says all new particles would have no electric charge. Is that necessarily true? Well, if the reaction produced two charged particles, their charges would have to sum to zero. But in reality, when an electron and positron annihilate, they produce photons (neutral) because producing other charged particles would require sufficient energy. Since the positron is slow-moving, the kinetic energy is low, so the total energy is just the rest mass energy of the two particles (2 * 0.511 MeV). To create other particles, their rest mass energy would need to be less than or equal to that. But the lightest charged particles are electrons and positrons themselves, which would just be the same as the initial particles. But annihilation usually results in photons. So B might be correct. But I need to check if there's a scenario where charged particles could be produced. For example, if there's a virtual photon exchange leading to some other process, but I think annihilation is more straightforward. So maybe B is correct?\n\nOption C: \"Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.\"\n\nThis sounds familiar. In the case of electron-positron annihilation at rest (or very low kinetic energy), the two particles annihilate into two photons moving in opposite directions. This is necessary to conserve momentum. If they produced a single photon, that would violate conservation of momentum because the initial momentum is zero (electron is stationary, positron is very slow), so the final momentum must also be zero. A single photon would have momentum in one direction, which can't balance out. So two photons moving in opposite directions would have equal and opposite momenta, summing to zero. So this is a standard result. So C seems correct. But let me check the wording: \"two identical gamma rays\". Identical in what sense? Energy, direction? Well, if they are moving in opposite directions, their energies would be the same if the system is symmetric. Since the electron is stationary and the positron is very slow, their rest masses are the same, so each photon would carry away half the energy. So each photon would have energy equal to the rest mass energy of one electron (0.511 MeV), so two photons each with 0.511 MeV, moving in opposite directions. So yes, they are identical in energy and opposite in direction. So C is a correct statement.\n\nOption D: \"Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If the positron annihilates with the electron, both should be destroyed. You can't have one annihilate and leave the other. Because they are matter and antimatter, their annihilation should result in their conversion into energy (photons or other particles), but you can't have one disappear and the other remain. Because that would violate conservation of charge. The electron has a charge of -1. If the positron is gone and the electron remains, then the total charge is -1, but initially, it was +1 and -1, total zero. So D would violate charge conservation. Also, energy-wise, if the positron is annihilated into energy, but the electron remains, then the energy would include the rest mass of the electron plus the positron? But that's not possible because the electron would still be there. But the problem is the charge. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo now, between options B, C. Let me re-examine B.\n\nOption B says that conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge. Since total charge is zero, the new particles must have total charge zero. But they could have individual charges as long as they sum to zero. For example, if they produced a pair of particles with +1 and -1 charges. But in reality, with low energy, this is not possible because the energy required to create other charged particles (like muons or pions) is much higher than the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. So in practice, the annihilation produces neutral photons. So in that case, B would be correct because all new particles are neutral. But is B strictly correct? The question is about conservation of charge indicating that all new particles have no charge. Well, conservation of charge only requires that the total charge is zero. It doesn't require that each particle is neutral. So B is not necessarily correct. For example, if two charged particles are produced with opposite charges, that would also conserve charge. However, in reality, for low-energy annihilation, this doesn't happen. But the question is about what conservation of charge indicates, not what actually happens. So B is making a statement based on conservation of charge. Since conservation of charge only requires that the total charge is zero, not that all particles are neutral, B is incorrect. Therefore, B is not necessarily correct. So the correct reasoning is that B is incorrect because conservation of charge allows for charged particles as long as their total is zero. The actual reason why the products are neutral is due to energy considerations, not just charge conservation.\n\nSo then, C is correct. Let me check again. The question is about conservation of momentum indicating that two identical gamma rays moving in opposite directions could be created. Yes, because in the rest frame of the system (since the positron is very slow and the electron is stationary, the center of mass frame is approximately their rest frame), the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momentum must also be zero. Two photons moving in opposite directions would have equal and opposite momentum, summing to zero. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nOption A: Conservation of mass... Well, mass isn't conserved in particle reactions. Energy is conserved, but mass can change. For example, the two particles (electron and positron) have a certain mass, but they can annihilate into photons which have zero rest mass. So conservation of mass isn't a thing here. So A is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
