Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that expressions like sin²x + cos²x = 1 are fundamental identities. Maybe I can use some power-reduction formulas or express higher powers in terms of lower ones. Let me recall that for even exponents, we can use identities involving squares and maybe use substitution variables. \n\nLet me denote a = sin²x and b = cos²x. Then, since sin²x + cos²x = 1, we have a + b = 1. \n\nGiven that, the original equation is sin¹⁰x + cos¹⁰x = 11/36. Let's express that in terms of a and b. Since sin¹⁰x is (sin²x)^5 = a^5 and similarly cos¹⁰x is b^5. So, the equation becomes:\n\na^5 + b^5 = 11/36.\n\nAnd we need to find sin¹²x + cos¹²x, which is a^6 + b^6. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a^6 + b^6 given that a + b = 1 and a^5 + b^5 = 11/36. \n\nAlright, so maybe I can use recurrence relations or express higher powers in terms of lower ones. Let me recall that for expressions like a^n + b^n, there is a recursive formula. Since a + b = 1, and ab = something. Let me denote ab = k. Then, since a + b = 1, ab = k. Then, we can express higher powers in terms of k. \n\nLet me recall that a² + b² = (a + b)² - 2ab = 1 - 2k.\n\nSimilarly, a³ + b³ = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) = 1 - 3k.\n\nSimilarly, a^4 + b^4 = (a² + b²)^2 - 2(ab)^2 = (1 - 2k)^2 - 2k² = 1 - 4k + 4k² - 2k² = 1 - 4k + 2k².\n\nSimilarly, a^5 + b^5 can be expressed as (a + b)(a^4 + b^4) - ab(a³ + b³). Let me check that formula. \n\nYes, in general, a^n + b^n = (a + b)(a^{n-1} + b^{n-1}) - ab(a^{n-2} + b^{n-2}).\n\nSo, applying that for n=5:\n\na^5 + b^5 = (a + b)(a^4 + b^4) - ab(a³ + b³) = 1*(1 - 4k + 2k²) - k*(1 - 3k) = (1 - 4k + 2k²) - k + 3k² = 1 - 5k + 5k².\n\nAnd we know that this equals 11/36. Therefore:\n\n1 - 5k + 5k² = 11/36.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n5k² - 5k + 1 = 11/36.\n\nMultiply both sides by 36 to eliminate denominators:\n\n36*(5k² - 5k + 1) = 11.\n\nCalculating left side:\n\n180k² - 180k + 36 = 11.\n\nSubtract 11:\n\n180k² - 180k + 25 = 0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation: 180k² - 180k + 25 = 0.\n\nLet me try to solve for k. Let me compute discriminant D:\n\nD = (180)^2 - 4*180*25 = 32400 - 18000 = 14400.\n\nSquare root of D is 120.\n\nTherefore, k = [180 ± 120]/(2*180) = [180 ± 120]/360.\n\nCalculating both possibilities:\n\nFirst solution: (180 + 120)/360 = 300/360 = 5/6.\n\nSecond solution: (180 - 120)/360 = 60/360 = 1/6.\n\nSo k is either 5/6 or 1/6. Wait, but k = ab. Since a + b = 1, and a and b are sin²x and cos²x, which are both non-negative and between 0 and 1. Therefore, ab must be between 0 and 1/4, since maximum of ab when a = b = 1/2, so ab = 1/4. \n\nTherefore, if k is 5/6, that would be impossible because 5/6 is greater than 1/4. Hence, only possible solution is k = 1/6. Therefore, ab = 1/6. \n\nWait, let me check that. If a + b = 1, then maximum value of ab is when a = b = 1/2, so ab = 1/4. Since 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 and 1/4 = 0.25, so yes, 1/6 is less than 1/4, so possible. But 5/6 ≈ 0.833 is way larger than 1/4, so impossible. Therefore, k = 1/6. \n\nTherefore, ab = 1/6. \n\nNow, our goal is to compute a^6 + b^6. Let me use the same recursive formula. Let me first compute a^4 + b^4, a^5 + b^5, then a^6 + b^6. Alternatively, maybe derive a formula for a^6 + b^6. \n\nAlternatively, use the recurrence relation again. Let me recall the recurrence:\n\na^n + b^n = (a + b)(a^{n-1} + b^{n-1}) - ab(a^{n-2} + b^{n-2}).\n\nWe have already computed up to a^5 + b^5. Let me note down previous values:\n\nLet me tabulate:\n\nLet me denote S(n) = a^n + b^n.\n\nWe know:\n\nS(1) = a + b = 1.\n\nS(2) = 1 - 2k = 1 - 2*(1/6) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nS(3) = 1 - 3k = 1 - 3*(1/6) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nS(4) = 1 - 4k + 2k². Let me compute that:\n\nk = 1/6, so:\n\n1 - 4*(1/6) + 2*(1/6)^2 = 1 - 2/3 + 2*(1/36) = 1 - 2/3 + 1/18.\n\nConvert to eighteenths:\n\n18/18 - 12/18 + 1/18 = (18 - 12 + 1)/18 = 7/18. \n\nTherefore, S(4) = 7/18.\n\nThen S(5) is given as 11/36. Let me check if my formula for S(5) is correct. \n\nEarlier, I had S(5) = 1 - 5k + 5k². Let me compute that with k = 1/6:\n\n1 - 5*(1/6) + 5*(1/6)^2 = 1 - 5/6 + 5/36 = (36/36 - 30/36 + 5/36) = 11/36. Correct. \n\nNow, moving on to S(6). Using the recurrence:\n\nS(6) = (a + b)*S(5) - ab*S(4) = 1*(11/36) - (1/6)*(7/18). \n\nCalculating:\n\n11/36 - (7/108) = Let me convert to common denominator, which is 108.\n\n11/36 = 33/108, 7/108 remains same. \n\nSo 33/108 - 7/108 = 26/108 = 13/54. \n\nTherefore, S(6) = 13/54. \n\nBut S(6) is a^6 + b^6, which is sin¹²x + cos¹²x? Wait, hold on. Wait, a is sin²x, so a^6 is (sin²x)^6 = sin¹²x. Similarly for b. Therefore, yes, sin¹²x + cos¹²x = S(6) = 13/54. \n\nBut wait, let me check if that is reduced. 13 and 54: 13 is prime, 54 is 2*3³. 13 doesn't divide 54, so 13/54 is reduced. Therefore, m = 13, n = 54, m + n = 67. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check my steps again, because sometimes when doing multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each step again. \n\nFirst, we set a = sin²x, b = cos²x. Then a + b = 1, ab = k. Then we found that S(5) = 1 - 5k + 5k² = 11/36, leading to quadratic equation which gave k = 1/6. Then we computed S(4) = 7/18. Then S(6) = S(5) - (ab)*S(4) = 11/36 - (1/6)(7/18). \n\nCalculating 1/6 * 7/18 is 7/108. Then 11/36 is 33/108. 33/108 - 7/108 = 26/108 = 13/54. Yes, that's correct. \n\nBut let me check if S(6) is indeed 13/54. Alternatively, maybe I can compute S(6) using another method to verify. \n\nAlternatively, S(6) can be calculated as (a³)^2 + (b³)^2. Which is equal to (a³ + b³)^2 - 2a³b³. \n\nWe know that a³ + b³ = 1/2, from earlier. Therefore, (1/2)^2 - 2*(ab)^3. \n\nSince ab = 1/6, so (ab)^3 = 1/216. \n\nTherefore, S(6) = 1/4 - 2*(1/216) = 1/4 - 1/108. \n\nConvert to common denominator 108:\n\n1/4 = 27/108, so 27/108 - 1/108 = 26/108 = 13/54. Same result. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 13/54, so m + n is 13 + 54 = 67. \n\nBut wait, let me check once again. Maybe there is a miscalculation in S(4). Let me recalculate S(4):\n\nEarlier, S(4) = 1 - 4k + 2k² with k = 1/6. \n\nSo 1 - 4*(1/6) + 2*(1/6)^2 = 1 - 2/3 + 2*(1/36) = 1 - 2/3 + 1/18. \n\nConvert 1 to 18/18, 2/3 is 12/18, so 18/18 - 12/18 + 1/18 = 7/18. Correct. \n\nThen S(5) = 1 - 5k + 5k² = 1 - 5/6 + 5/36 = 1/6 + 5/36 = 6/36 + 5/36 = 11/36. Correct. \n\nThen S(6) via recurrence: 1*S(5) - k*S(4) = 11/36 - (1/6)(7/18) = 11/36 - 7/(108) = 33/108 - 7/108 = 26/108 = 13/54. Correct. \n\nAlternatively, using the other formula, S(6) = (a³ + b³)^2 - 2(ab)^3 = (1/2)^2 - 2*(1/6)^3 = 1/4 - 2*(1/216) = 1/4 - 1/108. \n\nConvert 1/4 to 27/108 and 1/108 is 1/108, so 26/108. Yep. \n\nTherefore, seems like 13/54 is correct. \n\nBut let me check if 13 and 54 are coprime. The prime factors of 54 are 2 and 3. 13 is prime, doesn't divide 54. So yes, 13/54 is reduced. \n\nTherefore, m + n = 13 + 54 = 67. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that there isn't a mistake in assuming that ab = 1/6. Let me check that again. \n\nOriginal equation was 5k² -5k +1 = 11/36. Then multiplying by 36 gives 180k² - 180k + 36 = 11, so 180k² - 180k + 25 = 0. Then discriminant D = 180² - 4*180*25. Let me recalculate D:\n\n180² is 32400. 4*180*25 is 4*4500 = 18000. Therefore, D = 32400 - 18000 = 14400. Square root of D is 120. Then solutions are [180 ± 120]/(2*180) = [180 ± 120]/360. \n\nFirst solution: (180 + 120)/360 = 300/360 = 5/6. Second solution: (180 - 120)/360 = 60/360 = 1/6. \n\nBut since ab = k must be less than or equal to 1/4, 5/6 is invalid. Therefore, k = 1/6. Correct. \n\nTherefore, all steps are correct. Therefore, answer is 13/54, so 13 + 54 = 67. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using substitution or other identities, just to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, since we have sin¹⁰x + cos¹⁰x = 11/36, maybe express them in terms of lower exponents. For example, sin¹⁰x can be written as (sin²x)^5, and similarly for cosine. \n\nAlternatively, maybe express sin¹⁰x + cos¹⁰x in terms of sin²x + cos²x, which is 1, and other terms. \n\nBut that's essentially what I did by setting a and b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution variables for sin²x and cos²x. Let me suppose that sin²x = t, so cos²x = 1 - t. Then, sin¹⁰x + cos¹⁰x = t^5 + (1 - t)^5 = 11/36. Then solve for t, then compute t^6 + (1 - t)^6. But this seems more complicated, because solving t^5 + (1 - t)^5 = 11/36 would lead to a fifth-degree equation. However, maybe with symmetry, since t and 1 - t would be symmetric. Let me check.\n\nLet me compute t^5 + (1 - t)^5. Let me expand (1 - t)^5:\n\n(1 - t)^5 = 1 - 5t + 10t² - 10t³ + 5t⁴ - t^5. Therefore, t^5 + (1 - t)^5 = t^5 + 1 - 5t + 10t² - 10t³ + 5t⁴ - t^5 = 1 - 5t + 10t² - 10t³ + 5t⁴. \n\nSet equal to 11/36:\n\n1 - 5t + 10t² - 10t³ + 5t⁴ = 11/36. Multiply both sides by 36:\n\n36 - 180t + 360t² - 360t³ + 180t⁴ = 11. \n\nSubtract 11:\n\n25 - 180t + 360t² - 360t³ + 180t⁴ = 0. \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me note that earlier approach with a and b and ab = k was better. \n\nBut maybe we can relate this equation with previous results. Since we already found that ab = 1/6, and a + b = 1, so if a and b are roots of the equation x² - x + 1/6 = 0. Therefore, solving for t, which is either a or b. \n\nBut maybe this isn't helpful here. Alternatively, since we already solved it through the recurrence, and verified through two different methods, maybe it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with numbers. Suppose that ab = 1/6 and a + b = 1. Let me find a and b. \n\nThe quadratic equation is x² - x + 1/6 = 0. Multiply by 6: 6x² - 6x + 1 = 0. \n\nSolutions: [6 ± sqrt(36 - 24)] / 12 = [6 ± sqrt(12)] / 12 = [6 ± 2*sqrt(3)] / 12 = [3 ± sqrt(3)] / 6. \n\nTherefore, a = [3 + sqrt(3)] / 6, b = [3 - sqrt(3)] / 6, or vice versa. \n\nLet me compute a^5 + b^5 with these values. Let me check if it's 11/36. \n\nAlternatively, since we already derived that with ab = 1/6, S(5) = 11/36, so it must be correct. \n\nAlternatively, compute a^5 + b^5 numerically. Let me approximate. \n\nCompute [3 + sqrt(3)] / 6 ≈ [3 + 1.732]/6 ≈ 4.732 / 6 ≈ 0.7887. \n\nSimilarly, [3 - sqrt(3)] / 6 ≈ [3 - 1.732]/6 ≈ 1.268 / 6 ≈ 0.2113. \n\nSo a ≈ 0.7887, b ≈ 0.2113. \n\nCompute a^5 + b^5 ≈ 0.7887^5 + 0.2113^5. \n\nFirst, 0.7887^2 ≈ 0.622, then 0.622 * 0.7887 ≈ 0.490 (approx 0.7887^3). Then 0.490 * 0.7887 ≈ 0.386 (approx 0.7887^4). Multiply by 0.7887: ≈ 0.386 * 0.7887 ≈ 0.304. \n\nSimilarly, 0.2113^5: 0.2113^2 ≈ 0.0446, 0.0446 * 0.2113 ≈ 0.00942 (third power), * 0.2113 ≈ 0.002 (fourth power), * 0.2113 ≈ 0.000422. \n\nSo total a^5 + b^5 ≈ 0.304 + 0.000422 ≈ 0.3044. \n\nNow 11/36 ≈ 0.3055... So there is a slight discrepancy due to my approximate calculations, but they are close. Therefore, seems correct. \n\nTherefore, my value of ab = 1/6 is correct. Therefore, proceeding with that, S(6) = 13/54 ≈ 0.2407. Let me check with approximate numbers. \n\nCompute a^6 + b^6 ≈ 0.7887^6 + 0.2113^6. \n\nFrom previous, a^5 ≈ 0.304, so multiply by a ≈ 0.7887: 0.304 * 0.7887 ≈ 0.2397. \n\nFor b^6: previous b^5 ≈ 0.000422 * 0.2113 ≈ 0.0000892. \n\nTherefore, total ≈ 0.2397 + 0.0000892 ≈ 0.2398. \n\nNow, 13/54 ≈ 0.2407. The approximate value is 0.2398, which is very close, considering my approximated calculations. Therefore, seems correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. So the answer is 13/54, so m + n = 13 + 54 = 67. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{67}\n</think>"}
