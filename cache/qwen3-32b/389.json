The metric provided is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). The question is asking for the area when the radius r = 2. Hmm, first, I need to recall how to compute the area from a metric. \n\nIn general, for a two-dimensional Riemannian metric given by ds² = E dx² + 2F dx dy + G dy², the area element is sqrt(EG - F²) dx dy. In this case, the metric is diagonal, meaning F = 0, and E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Therefore, the area element should be sqrt(E*G) dx dy = sqrt(E²) dx dy = E dx dy. Wait, since E = G here, so sqrt(EG - F²) becomes sqrt(E*G) since F is zero? Wait, no, actually, for a diagonal metric, the area element is sqrt(EG) dx dy. But since E and G are equal here, it would be E dx dy. Let me check that again. \n\nYes, if the metric is ds² = E dx² + G dy², then the area element is sqrt(EG) dx dy. So here, E and G are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). Therefore, the area element is sqrt[(32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²))] = 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. \n\nSo the area element is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. Therefore, to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the domain where the metric is defined. \n\nBut what is the domain here? The denominator is 4 - x² - y², so we need 4 - x² - y² > 0 to have a real metric. Therefore, x² + y² < 4. So the domain is the open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin. However, when computing areas, we usually consider the closed disk, but since at x² + y² = 4 the metric becomes singular (denominator zero), maybe the area integral will diverge? Wait, but the question says \"pseudosphere of radius r = 2\". Maybe there's some parameterization or coordinate system here that I need to consider?\n\nWait, the pseudosphere is typically a surface with constant negative curvature, like the hyperbolic plane, but often represented via parametrization. However, in this case, the metric is given in terms of x and y coordinates. Maybe this is a different coordinate system? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coordinates x and y are not the standard Cartesian coordinates on the disk, but maybe something else. However, given the metric is expressed in terms of dx² + dy² scaled by a factor, it seems like we can treat it as a Riemannian metric on the disk of radius 2.\n\nSo to compute the area, we need to integrate 32/(4 - x² - y²) over the disk x² + y² < 4. Let me switch to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². The Jacobian determinant for polar coordinates is r, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ. Therefore, the area integral becomes:\n\nArea = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ, where r ranges from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.\n\nSo let me write that out:\n\nArea = 32 * ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀² [r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.\n\nFirst, compute the radial integral ∫₀² [r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me make substitution u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so -du/2 = r dr. When r = 0, u = 4; when r = 2, u = 4 - 4 = 0. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\n∫_{u=4}^{u=0} [1/u] (-du/2) = (1/2) ∫₀⁴ (1/u) du.\n\nBut ∫1/u du is ln|u| + C. Therefore, the integral becomes (1/2)(ln 4 - ln 0). Wait, but ln 0 is negative infinity. So this integral diverges? That would mean the area is infinite? But the question gives options including D: +infty. However, the problem mentions \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". Wait, but if the integral diverges, then the area would be infinite? But pseudospheres usually have finite area, right? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The integral ∫₀² [r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me do it without substitution. Let me note that the integrand is r/(4 - r²). Let me write it as -1/2 * (-2r)/(4 - r²) dr. Which is -1/2 * d/dr [ln|4 - r²|]. Therefore, integrating from 0 to 2:\n\n-1/2 [ln|4 - r²|] from 0 to 2 = -1/2 [ln(4 - 4) - ln(4 - 0)] = -1/2 [ln(0) - ln(4)].\n\nBut ln(0) approaches -infty, so this becomes -1/2 [ -infty - ln 4 ] = +infty / 2 = +infty. Therefore, the radial integral diverges. Therefore, the total area is infinite? So the answer would be D: +infty?\n\nBut wait, the question says \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. In the standard pseudosphere (the surface of revolution with constant negative curvature), the area is finite. But maybe this metric is different? Let me check the metric again.\n\nGiven the metric ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²)(dx² + dy²). Let me recall that for the Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = 4/(1 - r²)² (dx² + dy²). So in that case, the area element would be 4/(1 - r²)² * r dr dθ. The integral would be ∫₀^1 ∫₀^{2π} [4/(1 - r²)²] * r dr dθ. Which also diverges? Wait, let me check:\n\nLet me compute ∫₀^1 [r / (1 - r²)²] dr. Let u = 1 - r², du = -2r dr, so -du/2 = r dr. Then integral becomes ∫_{u=1}^{u=0} [1/u²] (-du/2) = 1/2 ∫₀¹ u^{-2} du. But ∫u^{-2} du from 0 to 1 is divergent, because near u=0, it behaves like 1/u². Therefore, even the Poincaré disk has infinite area? Wait, but that contradicts my previous knowledge. Wait, no, the Poincaré disk model does have infinite area. Because hyperbolic plane is non-compact, even though it's represented as a disk. So maybe the pseudosphere here is analogous, and indeed has infinite area. However, the question says \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". Maybe in this case, the coordinates are such that the radius is 2? But if the entire disk up to radius 2 is considered, the area is infinite. \n\nBut then why is the question giving options like 4π(x² + y²)? That seems odd, since the area should not depend on x and y. Wait, options A and B have variables in them, which doesn't make sense for the total area. The total area should be a constant. Therefore, options A and B are probably incorrect because they depend on x and y. Option C is zero, which is not possible. Therefore, the answer must be D: +infty. \n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the area integral. The metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²)(dx² + dy²). So area element is 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ. The integral is 32 * 2π ∫₀² [r / (4 - r²)] dr. As we saw, ∫₀² [r / (4 - r²)] dr diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area is infinite. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the metric. The given metric is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²)(dx² + dy²). Let me check if this is a standard metric. For example, the Poincaré disk metric is usually ds² = 4/(1 - r²)² (dx² + dy²). Let me compare. If we set 4 - r² in the denominator, and if we have a coefficient 32. Let me think. Suppose we have a metric of the form ds² = (4/R²)/(1 - (r²/R²))² (dx² + dy²) for some radius R. But in our case, the metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, not quite matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a different model.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coordinates here are not the same as the Poincaré disk. However, regardless of the model, if integrating over the entire disk up to radius 2 gives an infinite area, then the answer is D. Since options A and B depend on coordinates, which is not possible for the total area, they are invalid. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check once more. Let me consider substitution. Let me compute ∫₀² [r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me set u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr => -du/2 = r dr. When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{u=4}^{u=0} 1/u (-du/2) = 1/2 ∫₀⁴ (1/u) du. But ∫₀⁴ 1/u du is divergent because of the lower limit approaching zero. Wait, no, the integral from 0 to 4 of 1/u du is divergent because near u=0, it's like integrating 1/u. However, in our case, when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. Therefore, the integral diverges logarithmically. Therefore, the area is indeed infinite. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: +infty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
