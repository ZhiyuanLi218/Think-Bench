Let me start by recalling what electrolysis involves. In electrolysis, an electric current is passed through an electrolyte, causing chemical reactions at the electrodes. The anode is where oxidation occurs, and the cathode is where reduction happens. \n\nThe problem states that molten salt is the electrolyte, and the anode is made of aluminum alloy waste containing Cu, Mg, and Si. The goal is to regenerate Al. Let me think about the possible reactions here.\n\nFirst, the anode is the aluminum alloy. Since it's the anode, oxidation should occur here. The main component is aluminum, so maybe Al is oxidized. However, the alloy also contains Cu, Mg, and Si. I need to consider the reactivity of these metals. \n\nThe standard reduction potentials might help here. Let me recall the order of reactivity. From most reactive to least: Mg, Al, Zn, Fe, Pb, H, Cu. So Mg is more reactive than Al, which is more reactive than Cu. In the alloy, during electrolysis, the more reactive metals would tend to oxidize more readily. \n\nBut wait, in electrolysis, the anode is the site of oxidation. If the anode is made of a metal that can be oxidized, then it will dissolve. For example, if the anode is Al, then Al would oxidize to Al³+ and go into solution. But since the anode is an alloy with Cu, Mg, and Si, what happens to those?\n\nMg is more reactive than Al, so maybe Mg would oxidize first? But the process is supposed to regenerate Al. So perhaps during electrolysis, the less noble metals (like Mg) might oxidize and dissolve, while the more noble ones (like Cu) might not oxidize and instead fall to the bottom as anode sludge. Similarly, Si might behave differently.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nOption A: The reaction at the cathode is Mg - 2e⁻ → Mg²+. Wait, cathode is reduction. This reaction is oxidation (loss of electrons), so it can't be at the cathode. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Al is oxidized at the cathode. No, oxidation occurs at the anode. Cathode is reduction. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Anode sludge containing Cu is generated at the bottom. If Cu is less reactive and doesn't oxidize, it would not dissolve and instead collect as sludge. Since the anode is being oxidized, the metals that don't oxidize would remain. So yes, Cu would be in the sludge. So C might be correct.\n\nOption D: The mass changes of anode and cathode are equal. In electrolysis, the mass lost at the anode should equal the mass gained at the cathode if only one metal is involved. But here, the anode contains impurities (Cu, Mg, Si) which may not all participate in the reaction. Some may dissolve (like Al and Mg) and others not (like Cu). Therefore, the mass lost from the anode might not equal the mass gained at the cathode, because some mass remains as sludge. Therefore D is probably incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The anode is the aluminum alloy. The more reactive metals (Mg) would oxidize and go into solution. Al would also oxidize. Cu, being less reactive, wouldn't oxidize and would fall off as sludge. Similarly, Si might form compounds? Depending on the electrolyte. The question says molten salt, maybe cryolite or something. In aluminum production, typically Al2O3 is dissolved in molten cryolite. But here, the electrolyte is molten salt, perhaps similar. \n\nIn this setup, during electrolysis, Al³+ would be reduced at the cathode to Al metal. The anode would have oxidation reactions. For the anode, the metals that can be oxidized would dissolve. Mg has a lower reduction potential than Al, so it would oxidize more readily. However, if the process is intended to regenerate Al, maybe Mg is also being removed? Or maybe Mg is an impurity. \n\nBut the question is about the options given. The key is that Cu is less reactive and would not oxidize, so it would collect as anode sludge. Hence option C is correct. \n\nOptions A and B are incorrect as discussed. Option D is incorrect because the anode loses mass not only to the cathode but also to sludge. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>"}
