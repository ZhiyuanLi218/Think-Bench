Hmm, let me recall how expectation values work in quantum mechanics. The expectation value of an operator is given by the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So, in formula terms, ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. \n\nFirst, let me write down the given state. The spin state is given as (3i, 4), which I assume is a column vector. Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states need to be normalized, right? So before proceeding, I should check if this state is normalized or if I need to normalize it first. The norm of the state is calculated by taking the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. \n\nCalculating the norm: |3i|² + |4|². The absolute value of 3i is 3, so squared is 9. The absolute value of 4 is 4, squared is 16. Adding them together: 9 + 16 = 25. The norm is sqrt(25) = 5. So the state is not normalized; its norm is 5. Therefore, I need to normalize it by dividing by 5. So the normalized state |ψ⟩ is [3i/5; 4/5]. \n\nNow, the operator S_y is given in terms of the Pauli matrix σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, the problem mentions σ_y is the matrix given, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. But S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y, right? Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. \n\nTherefore, to compute ⟨S_y⟩, I need to calculate ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Let me write this out step by step. First, compute S_y |ψ⟩, then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|. \n\nLet me write down the normalized state again: |ψ⟩ = [3i/5, 4/5]^T. The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩. So taking the conjugate of each component and transposing. The conjugate of 3i/5 is -3i/5, and the conjugate of 4/5 is 4/5. So ⟨ψ| = [-3i/5, 4/5]. \n\nNow, let me compute S_y |ψ⟩. The matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so multiplying by ħ/2 gives S_y = (ħ/2)*[[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me perform the matrix multiplication:\n\nFirst component: (0)*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5\nSecond component: (i)*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = i*(3i)/5 = 3i²/5 = 3(-1)/5 = -3/5\n\nTherefore, S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2)*[ -4i/5; -3/5 ]\n\nNow, to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, I need to take the bra ⟨ψ| and multiply it with the vector S_y |ψ⟩. \n\nSo:\n\n⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] • [ -4i/5, -3/5 ] multiplied by ħ/2.\n\nLet me compute the dot product:\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12i²)/25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25\n\nSecond term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = -12/25\n\nAdding them together: -12/25 + (-12/25) = -24/25\n\nTherefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24/25) * (ħ/2) = (-24ħ)/50 = (-12ħ)/25\n\nSo the expectation value is -12ħ/25. Looking at the options given:\n\nA: 25ħ/2\n\nB: 12ħ/25\n\nC: -25ħ/2\n\nD: -12ħ/25\n\nSo the correct answer is D: -12ħ/25. \n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each step again.\n\nFirst, normalization: original vector (3i, 4). The norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25, so norm is 5. Normalized vector is (3i/5, 4/5). Correct.\n\nConjugate transpose for ⟨ψ|: (3i/5)* becomes -3i/5, and 4/5* is 4/5. So ⟨ψ| is [-3i/5, 4/5]. Correct.\n\nMatrix multiplication for S_y |ψ⟩:\n\nFirst component: top row of σ_y [0, -i] times vector components:\n\n0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5. Correct.\n\nSecond component: bottom row [i, 0] times vector components:\n\ni*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = 3i²/5 = -3/5. Correct. So S_y |ψ⟩ is [ -4i/5, -3/5 ] multiplied by ħ/2. Then taking the inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n\n[-3i/5, 4/5] • [ -4i/5, -3/5 ].\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5)(-4i/5) = 12i²/25 = -12/25. Correct.\n\nSecond term: (4/5)(-3/5) = -12/25. Correct. Total is -24/25. Multiply by ħ/2 gives -24ħ/(25*2) = -12ħ/25. Yes, that's correct. So answer D is indeed the correct one.\n\nBut let me check if I had to include the ħ/2 factor correctly. Since S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, then yes, the entire matrix multiplication includes that factor. So when I did the calculation, I correctly multiplied by ħ/2 at the end. Therefore, the expectation value is -12ħ/25. So answer D.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for expectation value directly. Alternatively, maybe using the components and the formula for expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, since S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, and σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, but maybe that's not necessary here. Alternatively, maybe writing the state in terms of eigenstates of S_y, but that might be more complicated. But since we already did the matrix multiplication and got the answer, and verified the steps, I think D is correct.\n\nAnother check: The possible answers have denominators of 2, 25, or 25. The answer we got is -12ħ/25, which is option D. The other options have different numerators and denominators. So unless there's a miscalculation, D is correct. Let me check the arithmetic once again:\n\nOriginal inner product:\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5)(-4i/5) = (12 i²)/25 = -12/25.\n\nSecond term: (4/5)(-3/5) = -12/25. Sum is -24/25. Multiply by ħ/2: -24/25 * ħ/2 = -12ħ/25. Yep, correct. So answer D.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
