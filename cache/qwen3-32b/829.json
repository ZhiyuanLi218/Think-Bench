Let me start by recalling what neutron activation is. It's a process where a nucleus captures a neutron, becoming a radioactive isotope. \n\nThe problem states that nitrogen-14 (¹⁴N) is bombarded with neutrons. So the initial nucleus is nitrogen-7, which has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (since 14-7=7). When a neutron is added, the nucleus becomes ¹⁵N? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the neutron bombardment would add a neutron to the nitrogen-14 nucleus. But the product is carbon-14. Wait, carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. So how does nitrogen-14 turning into carbon-14 happen with neutron bombardment?\n\nLet me write the nuclear equation. The general form is:\n\n¹⁴N + neutron → ¹⁴C + X\n\nLet me write the symbols properly. Nitrogen-14 is ^14_7N. Adding a neutron, which is ^1_0n. So the left side is:\n\n^14_7N + ^1_0n → ^14_6C + X\n\nSo the total mass number on the left is 14 + 1 = 15. The total atomic number is 7 + 0 = 7. On the right side, carbon-14 has mass number 14 and atomic number 6. So X must account for the difference in mass and atomic numbers.\n\nMass number: 15 (left) = 14 (C) + A(X) → A(X) = 15 - 14 = 1.\n\nAtomic number: 7 (left) = 6 (C) + Z(X) → Z(X) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n\nSo particle X has a mass number of 1 and atomic number of 1. What particle is that? A proton, which is ^1_1H or ^1_1p. So that would be a proton. But wait, let me check if there's another possibility. An alpha particle is ^4_2He, so no. Beta particle is an electron, which has mass number 0. Positron is also mass number 0. So the only one with mass number 1 and charge +1 is a proton. Therefore, X is a proton. So the answer should be (A) Proton.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because when a nucleus captures a neutron, usually it's a (n, γ) reaction, meaning it captures the neutron and emits a gamma ray. But here, the product isn't just a heavier isotope. Instead, it's turning into a different element. So maybe there's more than one step? Or is it a (n, p) reaction? Because neutron capture followed by proton emission?\n\nBut the problem says that neutron bombardment produces ¹⁴C and X. So in one step, the nitrogen-14 is bombarded with a neutron and directly produces carbon-14 and X. So the reaction is (n, p)? Because adding a neutron and then emitting a proton would decrease the atomic number by 1 (from 7 to 6), which is what's needed. So the reaction is:\n\n^14_7N + ^1_0n → ^14_6C + ^1_1p\n\nYes, that makes sense. So X is a proton. Therefore, option A. \n\nBut wait, I thought neutron activation usually involves capturing the neutron and becoming a radioactive isotope. For example, in the case of carbon dating, carbon-14 is produced in the atmosphere by neutron bombardment of nitrogen. Let me recall that. Yes, the actual reaction is:\n\n^14_7N + ^1_0n → ^14_6C + ^1_1p\n\nSo that's exactly this reaction. So X is a proton. So the answer is A.\n</think>"}
