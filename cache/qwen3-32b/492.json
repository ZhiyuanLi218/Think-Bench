The question is about measuring the wavelength of a sound wave from a guitar string using a meterstick. The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a guitar string's vibration does. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and creates a sound wave. The wavelength of that sound wave depends on the frequency and the speed of sound in air, right? But how do you measure the wavelength practically with just a meterstick?\n\nOption A says to touch the middle of the string to create a node and measure the length as the wavelength. Wait, when you touch the middle, that creates a node, so the string is vibrating in two segments. If the string is fixed at both ends, the fundamental frequency has a node at both ends and an antinode in the middle. But if you touch the middle, you're creating a node there, so it would vibrate in the first harmonic? Hmm, the length of the string would be half the wavelength for the fundamental frequency. If you touch the middle, you're forcing a node, so maybe the wavelength is twice the length? Not sure. But this is about the sound wave in air, not the string's vibration. Maybe the string's wavelength is different from the sound wave's. Wait, the question is about the wavelength of the sound wave in air, not the standing wave on the string. So touching the string might affect the string's vibration, but how does that relate to the sound wave's wavelength?\n\nOption B says measure the length of the string, which is half the wavelength. Again, if the string is fixed at both ends, the fundamental frequency has a wavelength that is twice the length of the string. But again, that's the wavelength of the standing wave on the string, not the sound wave in air. The sound wave's wavelength depends on the frequency and the speed of sound in air. So unless we know the frequency and use v = fλ, but the question says the frequency is known, but the method has to use a meterstick. So maybe this is not the right approach. So B is talking about the string's length being half the wavelength of the sound? Probably not. The string's length is related to the wavelength of the string's vibration, not the sound wave. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Adjust the length of a pipe so that resonances are heard. Measure the difference between pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength. Hmm. Resonance in pipes. For a pipe open at both ends, the resonant frequencies are multiples of the fundamental, with each consecutive resonance differing by a half wavelength. Wait, the difference between consecutive resonances in a pipe open at both ends is half a wavelength. Similarly, for a pipe closed at one end, the resonances occur at odd multiples, and the difference between consecutive resonances is a half wavelength as well? Wait, let me think. If you have a pipe that can be adjusted in length, and you're trying to find resonances for a given frequency (from the guitar string), then each time you adjust the length to get a resonance, the difference in length between two consecutive resonances would correspond to half a wavelength. Because for a pipe open at both ends, the fundamental is λ/2 length. The next resonance would be λ, then 3λ/2, etc. Wait, no. For a pipe open at both ends, the resonant lengths are λ/2, λ, 3λ/2, etc. So the difference between consecutive resonances is λ/2. Similarly, for a pipe closed at one end, the resonances are at λ/4, 3λ/4, 5λ/4, etc. So the difference between consecutive resonances is λ/2 as well. So if you adjust the pipe's length to get consecutive resonances, the difference in length is λ/2. Therefore, measuring that difference would give half the wavelength, so the full wavelength is twice that difference. Therefore, option C says the difference is half the wavelength, which is correct. So option C is a valid method.\n\nOption D: Measure the peak-to-peak distance of the wave as it passes; this is the wavelength. But sound waves in air are longitudinal, so the peaks and troughs are compressions and rarefactions. But how do you measure that with a meterstick? The question is about a practical method. You can't really measure the distance between peaks of a sound wave in air with a meterstick because it's not a visible wave. Unless you have some kind of visualization, but the question says using a meterstick. So D is not practical. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C. Let me check again.\n\nOption A: Touching the middle creates a node. The length of the string would be... if you have a node in the middle, then the string is vibrating at the second harmonic. For the string's standing wave, the wavelength is equal to the length of the string. But again, that's the wavelength of the string's vibration, not the sound wave in air. Unless the sound wave's wavelength is the same as the string's. But that's not necessarily the case. The frequency is the same, since the sound wave is produced by the vibrating string, so f is same. But the speed of sound in air is different from the speed of the wave on the string. Therefore, the wavelength of the sound wave is v_air / f, while the wavelength on the string is v_string / f. Since v_air and v_string are different, the wavelengths are different. Therefore, measuring the string's length (which relates to the string's wavelength) doesn't directly give the sound wave's wavelength. So option A is incorrect because it's about the string's wavelength, not the sound wave's. Therefore, the correct method is C, using a pipe to find resonances and measuring the difference between consecutive lengths, which gives half the wavelength. So the answer is C.\n</think>"}
