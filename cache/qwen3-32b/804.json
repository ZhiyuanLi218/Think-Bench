This **reduces** the amount of product (PCl₅), so this does **not** favor product formation.\n\n**B: Increasing the pressure**  \nThe reaction has **2 moles of gas** on the left (PCl₃ + Cl₂) and **1 mole of gas** on the right (PCl₅). Increasing pressure favors the side with **fewer moles of gas** to reduce the pressure. Thus, the system will shift **right** to form more PCl₅. This **does** favor product formation.\n\n**C: Increasing the temperature**  \nThe reaction is **exothermic** (ΔH < 0), meaning heat is released on the product side. Increasing the temperature adds heat, and the system will shift **left** to consume the excess heat, which **decreases** PCl₅.

I need to figure out how to manipulate this reaction to create more product, which is PCl5. The reaction is PCl3(g) + Cl2(g) ↔ PCl5(g) with ΔH = -92.5 kJ/mol. So it's an exothermic reaction because the enthalpy change is negative.\n\nFirst, I remember Le Chatelier's principle, which says that if a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it will shift to counteract the disturbance. So, any changes in concentration, pressure, temperature, or adding a catalyst can affect the equilibrium.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Decreasing the concentration of PCl3. If we remove PCl3, the system will try to make more PCl3 by shifting the reaction to the left, which would decrease the product. So that's not helpful. So A is probably not correct.\n\nB: Increasing the pressure. The reaction has different numbers of moles of gas on each side. On the left, there are 1 mole of PCl3 and 1 mole of Cl2, total 2 moles. On the right, there's 1 mole of PCl5. So if we increase the pressure, the system will shift to the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce the pressure. That would be the product side (right), so this should increase PCl5. So B might be correct.\n\nC: Increasing the temperature. Since the reaction is exothermic, heat is a product. If we increase the temperature, the system will shift to the left to use up the heat, which would decrease the product. So C is not correct.\n\nD: None of the above. If B is correct, then D is not. But I need to check if B is indeed correct.\n\nWait, when pressure is increased, the system shifts to the side with fewer gas molecules. Since the product side has fewer moles (1 vs 2), so yes, increasing pressure should shift to the right, producing more PCl5. So B is correct. So the answer should be B. Therefore, the correct option is B.\n</think>"}
