This apparent weight depends not only on the person's actual weight (mass times gravity) but also on the **acceleration** of the elevator.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\nThe apparent weight can be described using the equation:\n\n$$\nN = m(g + a)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ N $ is the normal force (scale reading),\n- $ m $ is the mass of the person,\n- $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²),\n- $ a $ is the acceleration of the elevator.\n\n- If the elevator is **accelerating upward**, $ a $ is positive, and the apparent weight $ N $ is **greater** than the person's normal weight.\n- If the elevator is **accelerating downward**, $ a $ is negative, and the apparent weight $ N $ is **less** than the person's normal weight.\n- If the elevator is **moving at constant speed**, $ a = 0 $, and the apparent weight is the same as the actual weight.\n\n---\n\n### Analyzing the Options\n\nLet’s evaluate each option to see if it results in the scale reading being **less than usual**:\n\n- **A: It is moving downward and slowing down.**  \n  If the elevator is slowing down while moving downward, it is experiencing an **upward acceleration**.

Let me start by recalling what happens when you're in an elevator. The scale measures the normal force, right? So when you're standing on a scale in an elevator, the scale reading depends on the acceleration of the elevator.\n\nIf the elevator is at rest or moving at a constant speed, the normal force equals the person's weight, which is mass times gravity. But if the elevator is accelerating, the normal force changes. If the elevator accelerates upward, the scale reads higher than usual because the normal force has to counteract both gravity and provide the upward acceleration. Conversely, if the elevator accelerates downward, the scale reads lower because the normal force is less than the weight.\n\nWait, but acceleration can also be in the direction of motion or opposite. Let me think. The key here is whether the elevator is accelerating upward or downward. If the elevator is accelerating downward, the apparent weight decreases. If it's accelerating upward, the apparent weight increases. So if the scale reading is less than usual, that means the elevator is accelerating downward.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA: Moving downward and slowing down. So if it's moving downward but slowing down, that means the acceleration is upward. Because if you're slowing down while moving downward, the acceleration is in the opposite direction of motion, which is upward. So that would cause the scale to read higher, right? Because upward acceleration increases apparent weight. So this would not be the case where the scale is less. So A is not correct.\n\nB: Moving upward and slowing down. If the elevator is moving upward but slowing down, then the acceleration is downward. Because when you decelerate while moving upward, the acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion, which is downward. Downward acceleration would decrease the apparent weight. So this would cause the scale to read less. So B is a possible correct answer.\n\nC: Moving upward at constant speed. If the elevator is moving at constant speed, there's no acceleration, so the scale reads normal weight. So C is not correct.\n\nD: Moving downward at constant speed. Similarly, if it's moving downward at constant speed, no acceleration, so the scale reads normal weight. So D is not correct.\n\nSo the answer should be B. But wait, let me double-check. Let me consider the physics equations.\n\nThe apparent weight is given by N = m(g + a), where a is the acceleration. If the elevator is accelerating downward, then a is negative, so N = m(g - |a|), which is less than mg. So if the elevator is accelerating downward, apparent weight is less.\n\nSo for B, moving upward and slowing down: acceleration is downward. So that's correct. So B is correct.\n\nA is moving downward and slowing down. That would mean acceleration is upward. Then N = m(g + a), so more than mg. So scale reading is higher. So A is not the case.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. Let me check the options again. Yes, option B says moving upward and slowing down. So that's the case where acceleration is downward, leading to lower scale reading. So B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
