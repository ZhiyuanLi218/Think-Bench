So, there's a biologist who wants to calculate the number of fish in a lake on May 1. She did a capture-recapture study. On May 1, she caught 60 fish, tagged them, and released them. Then on September 1, she caught another sample of 70 fish and found that 3 of them were tagged. \n\nBut there are some complicating factors here. The problem says that 25% of the fish from May 1 are no longer in the lake by September 1 because of death and emigrations. Also, 40% of the fish in the lake on September 1 weren't there on May 1 due to births and immigrations. The biologist is assuming that the sample she took on September 1 is representative of the total population in terms of tagged and untagged fish. \n\nSo, I need to use this information to estimate the number of fish in the lake on May 1. Let me recall the basic capture-recapture method first. The standard Lincoln-Petersen estimator assumes closed populations, meaning no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration between the two sampling times. The formula is usually N ≈ (number caught and tagged first time * number caught second time) / number recaptured. \n\nBut here, the population isn't closed. There are losses and gains. So, I need to adjust for that. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote N as the number of fish in the lake on May 1. That's what we need to find.\n\nOn May 1, 60 fish are tagged and released. By September 1, 25% of these original fish are no longer in the lake. That means 75% of the original N fish remain. So, the number of tagged fish still in the lake on September 1 is 0.75 * 60. Wait, no. Wait, if 25% of the fish from May 1 are gone, then 75% remain. But the total number of fish on May 1 was N. So, the number of original fish remaining on September 1 is 0.75*N. But of those, how many are tagged? Well, the tagged fish are a random sample of the original population. So, if 60 were tagged out of N, then assuming they are evenly distributed, the number of tagged fish remaining would be 0.75*60. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe not. If 25% of all original fish are gone, then regardless of whether they were tagged or not, 25% are gone. Therefore, the number of tagged fish remaining would be 60*(1 - 0.25) = 60*0.75 = 45. Similarly, the number of untagged original fish remaining would be (N - 60)*0.75. \n\nBut the problem is that on September 1, there are also new fish that weren't there on May 1. The problem states that 40% of the fish on September 1 were not there on May 1. So, if we let M be the total number of fish on September 1, then 40% of M are new fish, and 60% of M are original fish (from May 1) that remained. \n\nWait, so original fish remaining on September 1 are 0.6*M. But we also know that original fish remaining are 0.75*N. Therefore, 0.75*N = 0.6*M. Therefore, M = (0.75 / 0.6)*N = 1.25*N. So, the total population on September 1 is 1.25 times the population on May 1. \n\nSo, that's a relation between M and N. \n\nNow, on September 1, the biologist catches a sample of 70 fish. In that sample, 3 are tagged. Since the sample is representative, the proportion of tagged fish in the sample should be equal to the proportion of tagged fish in the entire population on September 1. \n\nSo, the proportion of tagged fish in the September population is equal to the number of tagged fish in September divided by the total population in September. \n\nNumber of tagged fish in September is the original tagged fish that remained, which we said was 45 (since 60 tagged on May 1, 25% lost, so 75% remain: 60*0.75=45). \n\nTherefore, proportion of tagged fish in September is 45 / M. \n\nBut we know from earlier that M = 1.25*N. Therefore, proportion is 45 / (1.25*N). \n\nThis proportion should be equal to the proportion in the sample, which is 3 / 70. \n\nTherefore, setting up the equation: \n\n45 / (1.25*N) = 3 / 70 \n\nSolving for N: \n\nMultiply both sides by 1.25*N: \n\n45 = (3 / 70) * 1.25 * N \n\nThen divide both sides by (3 / 70) * 1.25: \n\nN = 45 / [ (3 / 70) * 1.25 ] \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst, compute denominator: (3 / 70) * 1.25 \n\nConvert 1.25 to fraction: 5/4. \n\nSo, (3/70)*(5/4) = (15)/280 = 3/56. \n\nTherefore, N = 45 / (3/56) = 45 * (56/3) = 15 * 56 = 840. \n\nWait, so N is 840? Let me check that again. \n\nAlternatively, compute decimal values:\n\n(3 / 70) * 1.25 = (0.042857...) * 1.25 ≈ 0.053571...\n\nThen 45 / 0.053571 ≈ 45 / 0.053571 ≈ 840. \n\nYes, that seems to check out. \n\nBut let me make sure that my reasoning was correct. Let me recap.\n\nOriginal population: N fish on May 1. Tag 60. \n\nBy September 1: 25% of original fish are gone, so 75% remain. Therefore, original fish remaining: 0.75*N. \n\nBut also, 40% of the September 1 population are new fish, meaning 60% are original fish. Therefore, 0.6*M = 0.75*N => M = (0.75 / 0.6)*N = 1.25*N. \n\nNumber of tagged fish in September: original tagged fish that remained, which is 60 * 0.75 = 45. \n\nTherefore, proportion tagged is 45 / M = 45 / 1.25N. \n\nSample proportion is 3 / 70. \n\nSet equal: 45 / 1.25N = 3 / 70 => N = (45 * 70) / (1.25 * 3) \n\nCompute numerator: 45*70 = 3150 \n\nDenominator: 1.25*3 = 3.75 \n\nTherefore, N = 3150 / 3.75 \n\nDivide 3150 by 3.75: \n\nWell, 3.75 * 800 = 3000 \n\nSo 3150 - 3000 = 150 \n\nThen 150 / 3.75 = 40 \n\nTherefore, total N = 800 + 40 = 840. \n\nYes, same result. So, 840. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe using the standard capture-recapture formula adjusted for the population changes. \n\nIn standard capture-recapture, N ≈ (number tagged initially * number caught second time) / number recaptured. \n\nBut here, the population isn't closed. However, maybe we can adjust the numbers. \n\nThe key idea is that the tagged fish that remain are 45, as calculated. So if we think of the effective population on September 1 as M = 1.25N, and the number of tagged individuals in that population is 45. Then, using the standard formula, if we pretend that the population is closed, with N' = M = 1.25N, number tagged initially is 45, number caught second time is 70, number recaptured is 3. Then N' ≈ (45 * 70)/3 = 1050. \n\nBut N' is 1.25N, so 1.25N ≈ 1050 => N ≈ 1050 / 1.25 = 840. \n\nSame answer. \n\nTherefore, this seems to confirm the result. \n\nBut let me think again if there's a different interpretation. \n\nThe problem says: \"40% of the fish were not in the lake May 1 (because of births and immigrations)\". So, on September 1, 40% are new, 60% are original fish that remained. \n\nBut another way to think is that maybe the total population on September 1 is original fish that remained plus new fish. \n\nOriginal fish on May 1: N. 25% are gone, so 0.75N remain. \n\nNew fish: Let me denote them as X. \n\nTotal population on September 1: 0.75N + X. \n\nBut the problem says 40% of the fish on September 1 are not from May 1, meaning X / (0.75N + X) = 0.4 \n\nSolving for X: \n\nX = 0.4*(0.75N + X) \n\nX = 0.3N + 0.4X \n\nX - 0.4X = 0.3N \n\n0.6X = 0.3N \n\nX = (0.3 / 0.6) N = 0.5N \n\nTherefore, total population on September 1 is 0.75N + 0.5N = 1.25N, same as before. \n\nTherefore, same result. \n\nTherefore, total population on September 1 is 1.25N, with 45 tagged fish. \n\nSample of 70 fish, 3 tagged. \n\nSo, proportion tagged is 3/70 ≈ 4.2857%. \n\nProportion tagged in population is 45 / 1.25N. \n\nSet equal: \n\n45 / 1.25N = 3 / 70 \n\nSolving for N gives 840. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 840. \n\nBut let me check once more for possible errors. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nSuppose we don't think about the total population on September 1, but try to adjust the recapture probability. \n\nThe initial number of tagged fish is 60. However, by September 1, 25% have left, so 45 remain. \n\nIf there were no new fish, and the population remained at N, then the proportion would be 45/N, and we would estimate N via 45/N ≈ 3/70 => N ≈ (45*70)/3 = 1050. But this would be if the population size was still N, but with 45 tagged fish. \n\nHowever, the population isn't N anymore. It's larger because of the 40% new fish. \n\nBut how does that affect the calculation? \n\nIf the population is larger, then the same number of tagged fish would lead to a lower proportion. \n\nBut in reality, the population is 1.25N, so the proportion is 45/(1.25N) instead of 45/N. Therefore, the previous calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if we thought that the population has grown, then we need to adjust our expectation. \n\nTherefore, the answer seems to be 840. \n\nI think this is solid. Let me check with actual numbers. \n\nIf N = 840 on May 1. \n\nTag 60 fish. \n\nBy September 1, 25% of original fish are gone, so 75% remain: 0.75 * 840 = 630 original fish. \n\nNew fish: 40% of total September population. Let total September population be M. \n\nOriginal fish in September: 630 = 60% of M => M = 630 / 0.6 = 1050. \n\nSo total population on September 1 is 1050. \n\nNumber of tagged fish in September: 75% of original tagged fish: 60 * 0.75 = 45. \n\nTherefore, proportion of tagged fish is 45 / 1050 ≈ 0.042857, which is 3/70 ≈ 0.042857. \n\nTherefore, if you take a sample of 70, you'd expect 70 * (45 / 1050) = 70*(3/70) = 3 tagged fish. \n\nWhich matches the observed result. \n\nTherefore, N = 840 is indeed the correct answer. \n\nSo, I think that's solid. The answer is 840.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe biologist calculates the number of fish in the lake on May 1 to be \\boxed{840}.\n</think>"}
