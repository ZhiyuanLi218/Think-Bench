The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The options are A, B, C, D. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the IR data. The IR has medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are in the NH or OH stretching regions. Since there are two bands, maybe it's an amine with two N-H stretches? A primary amine usually has two N-H stretches, which can appear as two separate bands. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). So the compound likely has both an amine group and an ester or amide group.\n\nNext, the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), which is a triplet with 3H. That's probably a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ethyl group (since the next peak is a quartet at 4.5 ppm with 2H, which would be the methylene next to the oxygen). So that's an ethyl group. \n\nThen there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm with 2H. A broad signal could be an NH2 group, but sometimes OH is broad. However, since the IR suggests an amine, maybe this is an NH2. The next peak is a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which as I thought earlier, is the CH2 next to the ethyl group's oxygen. \n\nThen there are aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are doublets each with 2H, which is typical for para-substituted aromatic rings. The splitting into two doublets suggests that there are two substituents on opposite sides of the benzene ring. \n\nSo putting this together: we have an ethyl group (from the triplet and quartet), an amine group (from the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm and the IR NH stretches), and a carbonyl group (from the IR 1720 cm-1). The aromatic protons are para-substituted. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is an ester with a propyl group. But in the NMR, we have an ethyl group, not propyl. The triplet is 3H, so ethyl. So maybe not A.\n\nB: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide has an amide group (CONH2), and ethoxy is an ethyl group attached to oxygen. The IR would have a carbonyl from the amide. The NMR would have an ethoxy group. However, the aromatic protons in 3-ethoxybenzamide would have different splitting. The ethoxy is in the 3 position, so the aromatic protons might not be para-substituted. The NMR here has two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which suggests para substitution, so maybe not B.\n\nC: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. The ethoxy is in the 4 position of the phenyl. The carbonyl would be at 1720 cm-1. The NMR would have an ethoxy group (triplet and quartet), and the aromatic protons would be para-substituted. The amide NH2 would be a broad signal. However, formamide has a formyl group (CHO), but the ester here is formamide. The formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be C9H11NO2? Let me check the formula. The ethoxy is C2H5O, the formamide is CONH2. The phenyl ring is C6H4. So total C: 6 + 2 + 1 (formyl) = 9? Wait, formamide is HCONH2, so the carbonyl is between H and N. So the formula would be C: 6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formyl) = 9? Yes. H: phenyl has 4 H (since ethoxy is para), then ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3), then NH2. Wait, maybe I need to calculate. The molecular formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be C6H4(OCH2CH3)NHCONH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide is HCONR, where R is the 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formula would be C (6 in phenyl + 2 in ethoxy + 1 in formyl) = 9 C. N is 1 (from amide) and O is 2 (one in ethoxy and one in formyl). H is... Well, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's check. The formamide group is HCONH, so the formula would be H (from formyl) + NH2 (from amide). But maybe the exact count is correct. The NMR would have the ethyl group (1.20 triplet and 4.5 quartet), the aromatic protons as two doublets (para), and the NH2 as a broad singlet. The IR would have NH2 stretches and a carbonyl. So option C could fit.\n\nD: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This is an ester (benzoate) with an ethyl group and an amine. The structure is C6H4(NH2)COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2, which matches. The IR would have a carbonyl (1720) and NH2 stretches. The NMR would have ethyl group (1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet), aromatic protons as two doublets (para), and the amine as a broad signal. The difference between D and C is that D is an ester (COO) while C is an amide (CONH). The IR for D would have a carbonyl from the ester, which is around 1740 cm-1, but the given IR has 1720, which is lower, more typical for an amide. So maybe that's a clue. Amides have lower carbonyl frequencies compared to esters. So if the IR shows 1720, which is more amide-like, then D might not be the right answer. However, sometimes esters can have lower frequencies if conjugated or substituted, but 1720 is more characteristic of an amide. So between C and D.\n\nWait, but D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. The amine is on the benzene ring. The ester is COOEt. The carbonyl would be from the ester, so the IR would have a strong band at ~1740 cm-1. However, the given IR has 1720. So maybe D is not the right answer. \n\nOn the other hand, option C is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide has a carbonyl (C=O) and an amide group. The carbonyl in amides is typically around 1650-1700 cm-1, so 1720 is a bit high for an amide, but maybe possible. Wait, formamide specifically: the C=O frequency in formamide is around 1690-1710 cm-1. So 1720 is possible. Also, the NMR for option C would have the ethoxy group (triplet and quartet), the aromatic protons as two doublets (para), and the amide NH2 as a broad singlet. \n\nBut in the NMR data given, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm. If that's the NH2, where would it usually be? Amide NH2 is usually more downfield, like 5-7 ppm, but sometimes it can be broad and shifted. However, if the NH2 is in an amide, it might be more upfield. Wait, in amides, the NH2 is usually in the 5-7 ppm range, but if it's a primary amide (CONH2), the NH2 protons are usually around 6-7 ppm. However, in the given NMR, the broad signal is at 4.0 ppm. That's more upfield than typical amide NH2. Maybe it's an amine attached to the aromatic ring? For example, in aniline derivatives, the NH2 is around 4-5 ppm. If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (option D), the NH2 would be on the benzene ring, so around 4 ppm as a broad signal. The carbonyl would be from the ester, which is around 1740, but the given IR is 1720. However, maybe the conjugation with the aromatic ring lowers the carbonyl frequency. \n\nAlternatively, in option C, the NH2 is part of the amide group (CONH2), which would be more downfield. But the given NMR has the broad signal at 4.0 ppm, which might be the aromatic NH2. \n\nSo maybe the confusion is between D (ester with aromatic amine) and C (amide with ethoxy group). Let's check the molecular formulas. \n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is C6H4(NH2)COOCH2CH3. Let's count the atoms:\n\nCarbon: 6 (benzene) + 1 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 9? Wait, the COO is one carbon, the ethyl is two carbons. So total C: 6 + 1 + 2 = 9. Correct. \n\nNitrogen: 1 (NH2). Oxygen: 2 (COO and ethyl ester O). Hydrogen: let's see. The formula is C9H11NO2. For ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches. \n\nFor option C: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH(4-ethoxyphenyl). Carbon: 6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formyl) = 9. Correct. Oxygen: 1 (ethoxy) + 1 (formyl) = 2. Nitrogen: 1. Hydrogen: the formula is C9H11NO2. So both options C and D have the correct formula. \n\nNow, looking at the IR. The carbonyl in D (ester) is around 1740 cm-1, but the given IR is 1720. The carbonyl in C (amide) is around 1690-1710. So 1720 is a bit higher than typical amide, but maybe possible. However, the presence of two NH stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 is more characteristic of a primary amine (like in D, where the NH2 is on the benzene ring) rather than an amide NH2. Because in amides, the NH2 is usually involved in hydrogen bonding and the IR stretches might be different. \n\nIn primary amines (like in D), the NH2 groups have two N-H stretching bands, which is exactly what the IR shows. In amides, the NH2 (if present) would have one or two bands depending on the structure, but the presence of two bands here suggests a primary amine, not an amide. Therefore, the compound is more likely D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. \n\nBut wait, the NMR for D would have the aromatic protons as two doublets (para), which matches the given data. The ethyl group (triplet and quartet) is present. The NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which is consistent with an aromatic amine. \n\nSo the answer should be D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR shows the carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 (lower than typical ester due to conjugation with the aromatic ring), the NH2 stretches, and the NMR matches the ethyl group and para aromatic protons. \n\nBut wait, the ester carbonyl in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be conjugated with the aromatic ring, which could lower the carbonyl frequency. Conjugation with an aromatic ring can reduce the carbonyl frequency by about 30-40 cm-1. A typical ester is around 1740, so 1720 is plausible for a conjugated ester. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>"}
