Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that for first-order reactions, the half-life is related to the rate constant by a specific formula. I think the formula is something like t₁/₂ equals the natural logarithm of 2 divided by the rate constant. Wait, yes, that sounds right. So the equation is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. \n\nSo if I rearrange this formula to solve for k, it should be k = ln(2)/t₁/₂. Let me confirm that. Yeah, if I flip both sides of the equation, then k is ln(2) divided by the half-life. \n\nBut wait, the half-life is given in minutes, and the answer choices have different units. Let me check the units. The options are in s⁻¹ and min⁻¹. So I need to make sure whether the answer should be in per second or per minute. Let's see. \n\nThe half-life is 34 minutes. If I calculate k in terms of minutes, then k would be ln(2)/34 min⁻¹. If I need to convert it to seconds, then I have to convert the half-life from minutes to seconds first. Let me check the answer choices. \n\nLooking at the options: A is 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹, B is 2.04 × 10⁻² s⁻¹, C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹, D is 34 min. Hmm. D seems unlikely because the half-life is 34 minutes, and the question asks for the rate constant, not the half-life. So D is probably not correct. \n\nNow, the options A and B are in s⁻¹, and C is in min⁻¹. So maybe the answer could be either in seconds or minutes. Let me check both possibilities. \n\nFirst, let's compute k in min⁻¹. \n\nln(2) is approximately 0.693. So k = 0.693 / 34 min⁻¹. Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing 0.693 by 34. Let me do this division. Let me approximate. 0.693 divided by 34. Well, 0.693 divided by 34. Let me think. 34 goes into 0.693 how many times? Let me convert 0.693 to 69.3 divided by 1000. Divided by 34. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 0.693 / 34 ≈ 0.02038 min⁻¹. So approximately 0.0204 min⁻¹. Which is 2.04 × 10⁻² min⁻¹. Wait, but option C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹. That's 0.29 min⁻¹, which is higher than what I calculated. So that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, 0.693 divided by 34. Let me do this step by step. Let's see:\n\nFirst, 34 × 0.02 = 0.68. So 0.68 is 34 × 0.02. The numerator is 0.693. So 0.693 - 0.68 = 0.013. So the remainder is 0.013. So that would be 0.02 + (0.013 / 34). \n\nCalculating 0.013 / 34 ≈ 0.000382. So total k ≈ 0.020382 min⁻¹. Which is approximately 0.0204 min⁻¹, which is 2.04 × 10⁻² min⁻¹. But option C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹, which is 0.29 min⁻¹. That's way off. So perhaps I did something wrong here? Wait, no. The formula is correct? Let me check again. \n\nYes, for a first-order reaction, the half-life is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. Therefore, k = ln(2)/t₁/₂. So if the half-life is 34 minutes, then k is ln(2)/34 ≈ 0.693 / 34 ≈ 0.0204 min⁻¹. So that is 2.04 × 10⁻² min⁻¹. However, option C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹. That's not matching. So perhaps I need to check if the question is expecting the answer in seconds instead of minutes. \n\nLet me try converting the half-life to seconds. Since 34 minutes is equal to 34 × 60 seconds. Let me calculate that. 34 × 60 = 2040 seconds. Then k = ln(2)/2040 s⁻¹. Let me compute that. \n\nAgain, ln(2) ≈ 0.693. So 0.693 / 2040 ≈ let's see. Let me divide 0.693 by 2040. \n\nFirst, approximate 0.693 / 2000 = 0.0003465 s⁻¹. But since it's 2040, which is a bit more than 2000, the value will be slightly less. Let me calculate 0.693 / 2040. \n\nLet me do the division. 0.693 divided by 2040. Let me write that as 6.93 × 10⁻¹ divided by 2.04 × 10³. Which is (6.93 / 2.04) × 10⁻⁴. \n\nCalculating 6.93 divided by 2.04. Let me approximate. 2.04 × 3 = 6.12. Subtract that from 6.93: 6.93 - 6.12 = 0.81. Then 0.81 / 2.04 ≈ 0.397. So total is approximately 3 + 0.397 ≈ 3.397. So 3.397 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹. Which is approximately 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹. That matches option A. \n\nBut wait, option B is 2.04 × 10⁻² s⁻¹. That would be if we didn't convert minutes to seconds. Wait, if we incorrectly used minutes as seconds? Let me check. \n\nIf someone forgot to convert minutes to seconds and just used 34 minutes as seconds, then k would be 0.693 / 34 ≈ 0.0204 s⁻¹, which is 2.04 × 10⁻² s⁻¹. That is option B. But that would be wrong because the half-life is in minutes, so you have to convert to seconds to get the rate constant in per second. \n\nSo the correct answer is either A or C? Wait, when I calculated in minutes, I got 2.04 × 10⁻² min⁻¹. But option C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹. Which is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again. \n\nLet me recalculate 0.693 divided by 34. \n\nLet me write down 0.693 ÷ 34. \n\nLet me do this division properly. \n\n34 × 0.02 = 0.68 \n\nSubtract 0.68 from 0.693, we get 0.013. \n\nBring down a zero (assuming decimal division): 0.0130 becomes 0.0130. \n\n34 goes into 130 (which is 0.0130) how many times? 34 × 3 = 102, 34 × 4 = 136. So 3 times. \n\nSo 0.02 + 0.003 = 0.023, with a remainder of 130 - 102 = 28. \n\nBring down another zero: 280. \n\n34 × 8 = 272. So that's 8 times. \n\nSo now we have 0.023 + 0.0008 = 0.0238, with a remainder of 8. \n\nBring down another zero: 80. \n\n34 × 2 = 68. \n\nSo another 0.0002, remainder 12. \n\nSo approximately 0.0238 + 0.0002 = 0.0240... Wait, this seems conflicting with my earlier calculation. Wait, maybe my initial approximation was wrong. Let me do this carefully. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the decimal places. Let me redo the division step by step. \n\nDividing 0.693 by 34. \n\nFirst, 34 goes into 0.693... Let me think of it as 69.3 divided by 3400? No, that complicates. Let me use decimal division. \n\nLet me write 0.693 divided by 34. \n\nSince 34 is larger than 0.693, we need to add decimal places. Let me write it as 0.693 ÷ 34. \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 6.93 ÷ 340. Still, 340 is larger than 6.93. Multiply by 10 again: 69.3 ÷ 3400. Hmm, this is getting messy. \n\nAlternatively, let me use fractions. \n\nLet me consider that 0.693 / 34 ≈ (0.7 / 34) - (0.007 / 34). \n\n0.7 / 34 ≈ 0.020588. \n\n0.007 / 34 ≈ 0.0002058. \n\nSo 0.020588 - 0.0002058 ≈ 0.020382. \n\nSo approximately 0.0204 min⁻¹. So that is 2.04 × 10⁻² min⁻¹. \n\nBut option C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹. That's 0.29 min⁻¹. So there's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me check again. \n\nThe formula for the half-life of a first-order reaction is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. Therefore, k = ln(2)/t₁/₂. That's correct. \n\nSo if the half-life is 34 minutes, then k is 0.693 / 34 ≈ 0.0204 min⁻¹. So that is 2.04 × 10⁻² min⁻¹. But none of the answer choices have that. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA: 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ \n\nB: 2.04 × 10⁻² s⁻¹ \n\nC: 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹ \n\nD: 34 min \n\nWait, so if the answer is supposed to be in min⁻¹, then 2.04 × 10⁻² min⁻¹ is not among the options. But option C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹. That's 0.29 min⁻¹. That's way higher than what I calculated. So perhaps there's a miscalculation here. \n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated ln(2)? Let me check. The natural logarithm of 2 is approximately 0.693, yes. So that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe the question is not first-order? Wait, the question says it's a first-order reaction. So the formula is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using log base 10 instead of natural log? But no, for first-order reactions, the half-life formula is definitely using ln(2). \n\nWait, let me check another approach. Let me use exact value of ln(2). \n\nThe exact value of ln(2) is approximately 0.693147. \n\nSo k = 0.693147 / 34 ≈ 0.693147 ÷ 34. Let me compute this with more precision. \n\nLet me do this division properly. \n\nDividing 0.693147 by 34. \n\n34 × 0.02 = 0.68 \n\nSubtract 0.68 from 0.693147: 0.693147 - 0.68 = 0.013147 \n\nBring down a zero (assuming decimal places): 0.013147 becomes 0.013147. \n\nNow, 34 × 0.0003 = 0.0102 \n\nSubtract that from 0.013147: 0.013147 - 0.0102 = 0.002947 \n\nBring down another zero: 0.02947 \n\n34 × 0.00008 = 0.00272 \n\nSubtract: 0.02947 - 0.00272 = 0.000227 \n\nBring down another zero: 0.00227 \n\n34 × 0.000006 = 0.000204 \n\nSubtract: 0.00227 - 0.000204 = 0.002066 \n\nSo putting it all together: 0.02 + 0.0003 + 0.00008 + 0.000006 ≈ 0.020386 min⁻¹. So approximately 0.0204 min⁻¹, which is 2.04 × 10⁻² min⁻¹. \n\nSo that's the value. But none of the options C or B match this in the same unit. Option B is 2.04 × 10⁻² s⁻¹. Wait, if the answer is supposed to be in s⁻¹, then we need to convert 0.0204 min⁻¹ to s⁻¹. \n\nSince 1 min = 60 s, so 1 min⁻¹ = 1/60 s⁻¹ ≈ 0.0166667 s⁻¹. \n\nTherefore, 0.0204 min⁻¹ × (1 min / 60 s) = 0.0204 / 60 s⁻¹. \n\nCalculating that: 0.0204 / 60 ≈ 0.00034 s⁻¹, which is 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹. That's option A. \n\nBut wait, if we were to convert k from min⁻¹ to s⁻¹, we need to multiply by 60? Wait, no. Wait, if k is in min⁻¹, then to convert to s⁻¹, since 1 min = 60 s, then 1 min⁻¹ = 1/(60 s) = 1/60 s⁻¹. Therefore, to convert a value from min⁻¹ to s⁻¹, you multiply by 1/60. \n\nSo 0.0204 min⁻¹ × (1/60) s⁻¹/min⁻¹ = 0.0204 / 60 ≈ 0.00034 s⁻¹, which is 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹, which is option A. \n\nBut option B is 2.04 × 10⁻² s⁻¹. That would be if we didn't convert the units, just took k as 0.0204 min⁻¹ and wrote it as s⁻¹, which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way someone might get option C. Option C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹, which is 0.29 min⁻¹. How would that happen? \n\nIf someone used the formula k = ln(10)/t₁/₂ instead of ln(2)/t₁/₂? For example, if they confused it with a base 10 log. Let's check. \n\nIf they did k = log(2)/t₁/₂, where log is base 10. Then log(2) is approximately 0.3010. So 0.3010 / 34 ≈ 0.00885 min⁻¹, which is still not 0.29. \n\nAlternatively, if someone used the formula for a second-order reaction? For a second-order reaction, the half-life is t₁/₂ = 1/(k[A]₀). But since we don't have [A]₀, that doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone used k = t₁/₂ / ln(2). Which would be the inverse. If they did that, then k = 34 / 0.693 ≈ 49.07 min⁻¹, which is way higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a miscalculation of ln(2). For example, if someone thought ln(2) is 0.7, then 0.7 / 34 ≈ 0.0205 min⁻¹, which is still 2.05 × 10⁻² min⁻¹. \n\nAlternatively, if someone used log base e of 1/2? Wait, no. The formula is ln(2) over k. \n\nWait, maybe there's a typo in the options? Let me check again. \n\nOption C is 2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹. If I calculate 0.693 / 34, I get approximately 0.0204 min⁻¹. But 0.29 is ten times higher. Maybe they forgot a decimal? \n\nAlternatively, if the half-life was 3.4 minutes instead of 34, then k would be 0.693 / 3.4 ≈ 0.204 min⁻¹, which is close to option C if it was 2.0 × 10⁻¹. But the question says 34 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the person who made the options made a mistake in unit conversion? For example, converting 34 minutes to seconds as 34 × 60 = 2040 seconds, and then using k = ln(2)/t, which is 0.693 / 2040 ≈ 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ (option A). \n\nAlternatively, if they thought that k = 0.693 × 34, which would be wrong. That would give 23.56 min⁻¹, which is not an option. \n\nSo given that, the correct answer should be A: 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹. \n\nBut let me check once more. Let me verify with exact numbers. \n\nGiven t₁/₂ = 34 minutes = 2040 seconds. \n\nk = ln(2)/t₁/₂ = 0.693 / 2040 ≈ 0.0003397 s⁻¹ ≈ 3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹. \n\nYes, that's option A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA:3.4 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ \n\nB:2.04 × 10⁻² s⁻¹ \n\nC:2.9 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹ \n\nD:34 min \n\nSo yes, A is correct. \n\nBut why is option B there? Because if someone forgot to convert minutes to seconds, they would calculate k as 0.693 / 34 ≈ 0.0204 min⁻¹, and if they incorrectly wrote that as s⁻¹ instead of min⁻¹, then it would be option B. But that's wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
