The function f(z) = (a + bi)z is given, and it's supposed to have the property that for every point z in the complex plane, the image f(z) is equidistant from z and the origin. Also, we know that the modulus of a + bi is 8, so |a + bi| = √(a² + b²) = 8. We need to find b² expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.\n\nFirst, let me parse the condition: for every complex number z, the distance from f(z) to z is equal to the distance from f(z) to the origin. In mathematical terms, this means that for all z ∈ ℂ, |f(z) - z| = |f(z) - 0|. Let me write that down:\n\n|f(z) - z| = |f(z)|.\n\nSince f(z) = (a + bi)z, substituting that in gives:\n\n|(a + bi)z - z| = |(a + bi)z|.\n\nFactor out z on the left side:\n\n|(a + bi - 1)z| = |(a + bi)z|.\n\nUsing the property that |kz| = |k||z| for any complex number k and z, we can rewrite both sides:\n\n|a + bi - 1| * |z| = |a + bi| * |z|.\n\nHmm, since this must hold for all z, we can divide both sides by |z| (assuming z ≠ 0; but since it's true for all z, including z approaching 0, the equality must hold in general). Therefore, we get:\n\n|a + bi - 1| = |a + bi|.\n\nBut we know |a + bi| is given as 8. Therefore:\n\n|a + bi - 1| = 8.\n\nLet me compute |a + bi - 1|. The complex number a + bi - 1 is (a - 1) + bi. So its modulus squared is (a - 1)² + b². Therefore:\n\n√[(a - 1)² + b²] = 8.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(a - 1)² + b² = 64.\n\nBut we also know from the modulus of a + bi that:\n\na² + b² = 64.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. a² + b² = 64\n2. (a - 1)² + b² = 64\n\nIf we subtract the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n[a² + b²] - [(a - 1)² + b²] = 64 - 64\n\nSimplify left side:\n\na² - (a - 1)² = 0.\n\nExpanding (a - 1)²:\n\na² - [a² - 2a + 1] = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\na² - a² + 2a - 1 = 0 ⇒ 2a - 1 = 0 ⇒ 2a = 1 ⇒ a = 1/2.\n\nSo we found that a is 1/2. Now, substitute back into one of the equations to find b². Let's use the first equation:\n\na² + b² = 64 ⇒ (1/2)² + b² = 64 ⇒ 1/4 + b² = 64 ⇒ b² = 64 - 1/4 = 63 + 3/4 = 63.75.\n\nBut we need to express this as a fraction. 63.75 is equal to 255/4. Wait, let me check:\n\n64 is 256/4, so 256/4 - 1/4 = 255/4. Yes, so b² = 255/4. Therefore, m is 255 and n is 4. Are they coprime? Let's check. The prime factors of 255 are 5, 51, which is 5*51=5*3*17. 4 is 2². No common factors, so yes, 255 and 4 are coprime. Therefore, m + n = 255 + 4 = 259.\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me check my reasoning again. The key step was when I canceled |z| from both sides. Since the equation must hold for all z, including z ≠ 0, dividing both sides by |z| is allowed, and then we can conclude that |a + bi - 1| = |a + bi|. Then solving gives us a = 1/2 and then b² = 255/4. Therefore, the answer is 255 + 4 = 259. \n\nBut let me check if there's a possibility I missed something. For example, maybe there's another condition? The problem says that a and b are positive numbers, which is satisfied here since a = 1/2 is positive, and b² is positive, so b is positive. Also, the modulus is 8, which we used. So seems okay.\n\nWait, but let me verify with an example. Suppose z is some arbitrary complex number, say z = 1. Let's check if f(1) is equidistant from 1 and 0. \n\nf(1) = (a + bi)(1) = a + bi. The distance from f(1) to 1 is |a + bi - 1|, which we set equal to |a + bi|. According to our earlier equations, this is true. So for z = 1, it works. What about another z, say z = i?\n\nf(i) = (a + bi)i = ai + bi² = ai - b. The distance from f(i) to i is |ai - b - i| = | -b + (a - 1)i |. The modulus squared is (-b)^2 + (a - 1)^2 = b² + (a - 1)^2, which is equal to 64, same as |f(i)|^2 = |(a + bi)i|^2 = |a + bi|² |i|² = 64 * 1 = 64. Therefore, yes, the distance is 8. So |f(i) - i| = 8 and |f(i)| = 8. So that works. So seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 259.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{259}\n</think>"}
