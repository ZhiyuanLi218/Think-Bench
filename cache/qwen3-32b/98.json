Star Luminosity**\n\nThe luminosity $ L $ of a star is given by the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**:\n\n$$\nL = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ R $ is the radius of the star\n- $ T $ is the surface (photosphere) temperature\n- $ \\sigma $ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n\nGiven:\n- Star Y has a **photosphere temperature** that is **2 times** that of Star X: $ T_Y = 2T_X $\n- Both stars have the **same radius**\n\nSo, the luminosity of Star Y is:\n\n$$\nL_Y = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma (2T_X)^4 = 16 \\times 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T_X^4 = 16L_X\n$$\n\nThus, **Star Y is 16 times more luminous** than Star X.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

The question is about comparing the amount of heat energy that Planet Y receives from its star compared to Planet X. The problem gives several parameters, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the given information:\n\n1. The photosphere temperature of Star Y is 2 times that of Star X. So, T_Y = 2*T_X.\n2. The core temperature of Star Y is 3 times that of Star X. But wait, the problem mentions the photosphere and core temperatures. However, when considering the energy received by a planet, the relevant factor is the star's luminosity, which is related to the surface temperature (photosphere) and the star's radius. The core temperature might not directly affect the luminosity in the way we're thinking here. Maybe the core temperature is a distractor, or maybe it's related to the star's type or lifespan, but I think for calculating the energy received by the planet, we need the star's surface temperature and radius. The problem also states that both stars have the same size, so radius is the same for both stars.\n\n3. Stars Y and X have the same size. So, radius R_Y = R_X.\n\n4. Planet Y is 2 times closer to its star than Planet X is to its star. So, the distance from Planet Y to Star Y is half the distance from Planet X to Star X. Let's denote the distance as d. So, d_Y = d_X / 2.\n\n5. Both planets have the same rotation period. Not sure if this affects the total energy received, but maybe it's about day/night cycles and heat distribution, but the question is about the total energy received from the star, so rotation might not be directly relevant here. Maybe it's a red herring.\n\n6. Planet Y has a circumference 2 times larger than Planet X. Circumference relates to radius. Since circumference C = 2πr, if C_Y = 2*C_X, then the radius of Planet Y is twice that of Planet X. So, r_Y = 2*r_X. But how does the planet's radius affect the energy received? Well, the energy received by the planet depends on the cross-sectional area that intercepts the star's radiation. The cross-sectional area is πr². So, if the radius is twice as big, the area is 4 times as much. However, the problem is asking how many times more heat the planet receives, so we need to consider both the star's luminosity and the distance squared.\n\nSo, the key formula here is the energy received by a planet, which is proportional to the star's luminosity divided by the square of the distance between the planet and the star, multiplied by the planet's cross-sectional area.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"how many times will planet Y receive more heat (energy) from its star?\" So, we need to calculate the ratio of the energy received by Planet Y to that received by Planet X.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the luminosity (L) of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius of the star, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature (which is the photosphere temperature here). Since both stars have the same radius, R_Y = R_X = R, and the temperature of Star Y is T_Y = 2T_X, so L_Y = 4πR²σ(2T_X)^4 = 4πR²σ*16T_X^4 = 16*L_X. So Star Y is 16 times more luminous than Star X.\n\nNext, the energy received by a planet from its star is proportional to the star's luminosity divided by the square of the distance from the star. However, we also need to consider the planet's cross-sectional area. The total power intercepted by the planet is (L / (4πd²)) * πr², where d is the distance from the star to the planet, and r is the radius of the planet. Simplifying, that's (L * r²) / (4d²). So the ratio of energy received by Planet Y to Planet X would be [ (L_Y * r_Y²) / (4d_Y²) ] / [ (L_X * r_X²) / (4d_X²) ) ] = (L_Y / L_X) * (r_Y² / r_X²) * (d_X² / d_Y²).\n\nGiven that:\n\n- L_Y / L_X = 16 (from earlier)\n- r_Y = 2r_X, so r_Y² / r_X² = 4\n- d_Y = d_X / 2, so d_X / d_Y = 2, hence (d_X² / d_Y²) = 4\n\nMultiplying all these factors: 16 * 4 * 4 = 256. But wait, the answer choices don't have 256. The options are A:1300, B:65, C:650, D:250. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check the formula again. The energy received by the planet is the flux from the star multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the planet. The flux from the star at a distance d is L / (4πd²). The cross-sectional area of the planet is πr². So the total power received is (L / (4πd²)) * πr² = (L * r²) / (4d²). So the ratio between Planet Y and X is:\n\n(L_Y / L_X) * (r_Y² / r_X²) * (d_X² / d_Y²)\n\nWhich is:\n\n16 * 4 * 4 = 256. But the answer options don't have 256. The closest is D:250. Maybe the question is considering some approximation or maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, the problem mentions the core temperature of the star. The core temperature is 3 times higher for Star Y. But earlier I thought that the luminosity depends on the surface temperature and radius, not the core temperature. The core temperature is related to the fusion processes, but for the purpose of calculating the luminosity, we use the surface temperature. So perhaps the core temperature is a red herring here. The problem says that the photosphere temperature is 2 times higher, which is what we used. So maybe the core temperature is irrelevant here. So my calculation gives 256, but the closest answer is D:250. Maybe the question expects us to approximate 256 as 250? But 256 is 2^8, which is exact. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the cross-sectional area.\n\nWait, let's think again. The problem asks how many times more heat Planet Y receives. So if the luminosity is higher, and the distance is closer, and the planet's size is larger, then all contribute. Let me recalculate:\n\nL_Y = 16 * L_X\n\nDistance ratio: d_Y = d_X / 2 → so inverse square law: (1/d_Y²) / (1/d_X²) = (d_X² / d_Y²) = (d_X²) / ( (d_X/2)^2 ) = (d_X²) / (d_X²/4) ) = 4. So the flux from Star Y at distance d_Y is 4 times higher than flux from Star X at distance d_X, multiplied by the luminosity ratio. Wait, no. The flux is L/(4πd²). So the flux for Y is L_Y/(4πd_Y²), and for X is L_X/(4πd_X²). So the ratio of flux is (L_Y / L_X) * (d_X² / d_Y²). Then, multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the planet. Since the cross-sectional area is πr², the ratio of areas is (πr_Y²)/(πr_X²) = (r_Y/r_X)^2 = 4. So total ratio is (L_Y/L_X) * (d_X²/d_Y²) * (r_Y²/r_X²) = 16 * 4 * 4 = 256. So 256 times more energy. But the answer options are 1300, 65, 650, 250. So 256 is closest to 250 (option D). But maybe the question expects a different approach?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the Stefan-Boltzmann law with the core temperature? But that doesn't make sense because the core temperature is not the temperature at the surface. The Stefan-Boltzmann law uses the surface temperature (photosphere) to calculate the luminosity. The core temperature is much higher but is not directly related to the energy radiated from the star's surface. So I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different relation for the luminosity? For example, if the core temperature is 3 times higher, does that affect the luminosity? Well, core temperature is related to the fusion rate, which does affect the luminosity. However, the problem states that the photosphere temperature is 2 times higher, and the star's size is the same. So if the photosphere temperature is higher, and the star's radius is the same, then the luminosity is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law as L = 4πR²σT^4. So even if the core temperature is different, as long as the surface temperature is 2T, the luminosity is 16 times higher. So I think the core temperature is a red herring here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 256, which is closest to option D:250. But why is there no exact answer? Maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again:\n\nL_Y / L_X = (T_Y / T_X)^4 = 2^4 = 16.\n\nDistance ratio: d_Y = d_X / 2 → flux ratio is (d_X / d_Y)^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\nPlanet's cross-sectional area ratio: (r_Y / r_X)^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\nTotal ratio: 16 * 4 * 4 = 256. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 256. If the options are approximate, then 250 is the closest. So the answer is D:250.\n\nBut wait, the options are A:1300, B:65, C:650, D:250. So 256 is closest to D:250. Therefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
