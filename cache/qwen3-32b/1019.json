I need to find the spring constant of this spring. The problem says that the spring is originally 8 cm long and extends by 2 cm when a force of 4 N is applied. And the options are given for the spring constant. Alright, so first, I remember that Hooke's Law is involved here. Hooke's Law states that the force applied to a spring is equal to the spring constant multiplied by the extension. The formula is F = kx, where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the extension.\n\nSo, given that, I need to calculate k. The formula can be rearranged to solve for k: k = F/x. The force here is 4 N, and the extension x is 2 cm. Wait, but units are important here. The standard unit for length in physics is meters, so I should convert centimeters to meters to make sure the units are consistent.\n\nLet me convert 2 cm to meters. Since 1 cm is 0.01 meters, 2 cm is 0.02 meters. So, substituting the values into the formula: k = 4 N / 0.02 m. Let me calculate that. Dividing 4 by 0.02... Hmm, 4 divided by 0.02 is the same as 4 multiplied by 50, which is 200. So, k equals 200 N/m. Let me check the options again. Option D is 200 N/m. So, the answer should be D. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake with the unit conversion?\n\nOriginal length is 8 cm, but the extension is 2 cm. The original length might not matter here because Hooke's Law depends on the extension, not the original length. So, yes, x is 2 cm, which is 0.02 m. Force is 4 N. So 4 divided by 0.02 is indeed 200 N/m. The options are given with units. Let me check the options again. Option B is 40 N/m and D is 200 N/m. The other options have units of m/N, which is incorrect because spring constant should be in N/m. So options A and C can be eliminated because their units are upside down. So between B and D. Since my calculation gives 200 N/m, it's D. So the answer is D. \n\nWait, but why is there an option with 40 N/m? Let me recalculate. If someone forgot to convert cm to m, they would do 4 N / 2 cm = 2 N/cm. Then converting to N/m would be multiplying by 100, giving 200 N/m. Wait, that's still 200. If someone thought x was in cm and didn't convert, they would have 4 / 0.02 = 200. Wait, maybe someone might miscalculate 4 divided by 0.02? Let me do it again. 0.02 times 200 is 4, yes. So 4 divided by 0.02 is 200. So yes, D is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is D, 200 N/m. The other options either have wrong units or wrong magnitude. So I think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
