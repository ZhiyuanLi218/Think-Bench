Why Another Particle Must Exist:**\n\nIn particle physics, especially in the quark model, particles are grouped into **isospin multiplets** based on their isospin quantum numbers.

In this case, the $ \\Xi^{-} $ and $ \\Xi^0 $ form a doublet with isospin $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $, and the third component of isospin for $ \\Xi^{-} $ is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why there must be another particle given that the Xi-minus particle (Ξ⁻) has Q = -1, B = 1, and S = -2. Also, I need to determine the value of I₃ for Ξ⁻. Hmm, let's start by recalling some particle physics concepts. \n\nFirst, I remember that particles are classified by their quantum numbers: charge (Q), baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and isospin (I) and its third component (I₃). The Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula relates charge to these quantum numbers: Q = I₃ + (B + S)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me check. I think the formula is Q = I₃ + (B + S)/2. Yes, that seems familiar. So if I can use this formula, maybe I can find I₃ for Ξ⁻. \n\nGiven Q = -1, B = 1, S = -2. Plugging into the formula:\n\n-1 = I₃ + (1 + (-2))/2  \n-1 = I₃ + (-1)/2  \n-1 = I₃ - 1/2  \nSo solving for I₃: I₃ = -1 + 1/2 = -1/2. \n\nWait, so I₃ for Ξ⁻ is -1/2? Let me verify that. If I₃ is -1/2, then Q would be (-1/2) + (1 - 2)/2 = (-1/2) + (-1/2) = -1. Yes, that checks out. So I₃ is -1/2. \n\nBut the question also says that based on these properties, it's predicted there exists another particle. Why is that? Maybe because particles with certain quantum numbers are part of multiplets in the quark model. For example, baryons are organized into SU(3) multiplets. The Ξ baryons, for instance, are part of the decuplet or octet? Let me recall. \n\nThe baryon octet includes particles like the nucleons (proton, neutron), Λ, Σ, and Ξ. The Ξ has two strange quarks, right? Since its strangeness is -2, which implies two strange quarks because each strange quark contributes S = -1. \n\nIn the SU(3) flavor symmetry, particles are grouped into multiplets. The octet has different isospin values. Isospin I is related to how many states a particle has in a multiplet. For example, the proton and neutron form an isospin doublet (I = 1/2), with I₃ = +1/2 for proton and -1/2 for neutron. Similarly, the Σ baryons form a triplet (I = 1): Σ⁺ (I₃ = +1), Σ⁰ (I₃ = 0), Σ⁻ (I₃ = -1). \n\nNow, the Ξ baryons. There are two Ξ particles: Ξ⁰ and Ξ⁻. Their isospin multiplet must account for both. Since there are two particles, they form an isospin doublet, so I = 1/2. Therefore, if Ξ⁻ has I₃ = -1/2, then there must be another particle in the same doublet with I₃ = +1/2. What would that particle be? The Ξ⁰, right? Let me check. \n\nThe Ξ⁰ has I₃ = +1/2. Then using the Gell-Mann formula again for Ξ⁰: Q = I₃ + (B + S)/2. Let's see. If Ξ⁰ has charge 0, B=1, S=-2. Then Q = (+1/2) + (1 - 2)/2 = 1/2 + (-1)/2 = 0. Correct, that gives Q=0. So Ξ⁰ is the other particle in the doublet. \n\nTherefore, because Ξ⁻ is part of an isospin doublet (I=1/2), there must be another particle, Ξ⁰, with I₃ = +1/2. Hence, the prediction of another particle is based on the requirement of isospin symmetry. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"it has been predicted that there exists another particle.\" But Ξ⁰ was already discovered, right? Maybe the question is phrased in a way that when Ξ⁻ was first observed, the existence of another particle in the isospin multiplet was predicted? Or perhaps there's another aspect here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the quark model. The Ξ⁻ is composed of two strange quarks and one up quark: s s u. Because each strange quark has S = -1, two of them give S = -2, and the up quark gives +1 charge. Let me check: s has charge -1/3, so two s quarks and one u quark: total charge is (-1/3) + (-1/3) + (+2/3) = (-2/3) + 2/3 = 0? Wait, that's not right. Wait, Ξ⁻ has charge -1. Wait, my quark content must be wrong. \n\nWait, let me think again. The Ξ⁻ has charge -1. Let's figure out its quark content. If it's a baryon, it has three quarks. Strangeness -2 implies two strange quarks. The third quark is either up or down. Let me calculate the charge. Each strange quark has charge -1/3. Let me suppose the third quark is a down quark (charge -1/3). Then total charge is (-1/3) + (-1/3) + (-1/3) = -1. Yes! So Ξ⁻ is s s d. Therefore, the other particle in the isospin doublet would have the third quark as u instead of d. That would be Ξ⁰: s s u. Let's check its charge: (-1/3) + (-1/3) + (+2/3) = 0. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the existence of Ξ⁰ is required by isospin symmetry, just like how neutron and proton form a doublet. So if Ξ⁻ exists with I₃ = -1/2, there must be another particle with I₃ = +1/2, which is Ξ⁰. Therefore, the prediction is based on the isospin symmetry, which requires particles to come in multiplets. \n\nSo putting it all together: the need for another particle comes from the isospin symmetry (SU(2) subgroup of SU(3) flavor symmetry), which organizes particles into multiplets. Since Ξ⁻ has I₃ = -1/2 and is part of a doublet (I=1/2), there must be another particle with I₃ = +1/2, which is Ξ⁰. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that another particle must exist because of isospin symmetry requiring a doublet, and the I₃ of Ξ⁻ is -1/2.\n\nBut let me check again the calculation of I₃. Using Gell-Mann formula:\n\nQ = I₃ + (B + S)/2  \n-1 = I₃ + (1 + (-2))/2  \n-1 = I₃ + (-1)/2  \nSo I₃ = -1 + 1/2 = -1/2. Correct. \n\nAlternatively, if we think about isospin. For the Ξ doublet, the two particles are Ξ⁰ and Ξ⁻. Their isospin I = 1/2. So their I₃ values are +1/2 and -1/2. Since Ξ⁻ has lower charge, it's the one with I₃ = -1/2. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the reasoning is solid. The existence of another particle is required by the isospin symmetry, and the I₃ is -1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ I_3 $ for $ \\Xi^{-} $ is \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\n</think>"}
