Then express that minimum $ a $ as a reduced fraction $ \\frac{p}{q} $ and find $ p + q $.\n\nFirst, since the parabola has a vertex at $ \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, -\\frac{9}{8}\\right) $, I can write its equation in vertex form. The vertex form of a parabola is $ y = a(x - h)^2 + k $, where $ (h, k) $ is the vertex. So substituting the given vertex coordinates, the equation becomes:\n\n$ y = a\\left(x - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 - \\frac{9}{8} $.\n\nNow, I need to convert this vertex form into the standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $ to find expressions for $ b $ and $ c $ in terms of $ a $. Let me expand the vertex form:\n\nFirst, expand $ \\left(x - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 $:\n\n$ \\left(x - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 = x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{16} $.\n\nMultiplying by $ a $:\n\n$ y = a\\left(x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{16}\\right) - \\frac{9}{8} $.\n\nDistribute the $ a $:\n\n$ y = ax^2 - \\frac{a}{2}x + \\frac{a}{16} - \\frac{9}{8} $.\n\nTherefore, comparing with $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, we have:\n\n- $ b = -\\frac{a}{2} $\n- $ c = \\frac{a}{16} - \\frac{9}{8} $\n\nNow, the problem states that $ a + b + c $ is an integer. Let me compute $ a + b + c $:\n\nSubstitute $ b $ and $ c $:\n\n$ a + \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{a}{16} - \\frac{9}{8}\\right) $.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, combine the terms with $ a $:\n\n$ a - \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{a}{16} $.\n\nTo combine these, find a common denominator, which is 16:\n\nConvert each term:\n\n- $ a = \\frac{16a}{16} $\n- $ -\\frac{a}{2} = -\\frac{8a}{16} $\n- $ \\frac{a}{16} = \\frac{a}{16} $\n\nAdding them together:\n\n$ \\frac{16a - 8a + a}{16} = \\frac{9a}{16} $.\n\nSo the entire expression for $ a + b + c $ is:\n\n$ \\frac{9a}{16} - \\frac{9}{8} $.\n\nThis expression must be an integer. Let me denote this integer as $ k $:\n\n$ \\frac{9a}{16} - \\frac{9}{8} = k $, where $ k \\in \\mathbb{Z} $.\n\nSo, solving for $ a $:\n\nFirst, add $ \\frac{9}{8} $ to both sides:\n\n$ \\frac{9a}{16} = k + \\frac{9}{8} $.\n\nMultiply both sides by $ \\frac{16}{9} $:\n\n$ a = \\left(k + \\frac{9}{8}\\right) \\times \\frac{16}{9} $.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, write $ k $ as $ \\frac{8k}{8} $:\n\n$ a = \\left(\\frac{8k + 9}{8}\\right) \\times \\frac{16}{9} $.\n\nMultiply the fractions:\n\n$ a = \\frac{(8k + 9) \\times 16}{8 \\times 9} $.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8:\n\nNumerator becomes $ (8k + 9) \\times 2 $, denominator becomes 9.\n\nSo:\n\n$ a = \\frac{2(8k + 9)}{9} $.\n\nSimplify further:\n\n$ a = \\frac{16k + 18}{9} $.\n\nTherefore, $ a = \\frac{16k + 18}{9} $.\n\nBut we are told that $ a > 0 $, so:\n\n$ \\frac{16k + 18}{9} > 0 $.\n\nMultiply both sides by 9:\n\n$ 16k + 18 > 0 $\n\nSolving for $ k $:\n\n$ 16k > -18 $\n\n$ k > -\\frac{18}{16} $\n\nSimplify:\n\n$ k > -\\frac{9}{8} $\n\nSince $ k $ is an integer, $ k \\geq -1 $.\n\nTherefore, possible integer values of $ k $ are $ -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots $\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum possible value of $ a $, which is positive. Since $ a = \\frac{16k + 18}{9} $, and $ k $ is integer with $ k \\geq -1 $, we need to find the smallest possible $ a $.\n\nSince $ a $ increases as $ k $ increases (because the coefficient of $ k $ is positive), the minimum value of $ a $ occurs at the smallest possible $ k $, which is $ k = -1 $.\n\nLet me check if $ k = -1 $ gives a positive $ a $:\n\n$ a = \\frac{16(-1) + 18}{9} = \\frac{-16 + 18}{9} = \\frac{2}{9} $.\n\nWhich is positive, so that works. Now, we need to check if this is valid. Wait, but we need to make sure that with this value of $ a $, the original conditions are satisfied. But we derived $ a $ based on the condition that $ a + b + c $ is integer, so if we use this formula, then it should satisfy that. Let me verify.\n\nLet me compute $ a + b + c $ when $ a = 2/9 $:\n\nEarlier, we had $ a + b + c = \\frac{9a}{16} - \\frac{9}{8} $.\n\nSubstituting $ a = 2/9 $:\n\n$ \\frac{9*(2/9)}{16} - 9/8 = \\frac{2}{16} - 9/8 = 1/8 - 9/8 = -8/8 = -1 $, which is integer. So yes, it works. So $ k = -1 $ gives $ a + b + c = -1 $, which is integer.\n\nBut before we conclude that $ a = 2/9 $ is the minimal possible value, we need to check if there are any constraints we might have missed. For example, maybe there are other values of $ k $ that could lead to smaller $ a $? But since $ a $ increases with $ k $, and $ k \\geq -1 $, the minimal $ a $ occurs at $ k = -1 $. So 2/9 seems to be the minimal possible value.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check if there are any other constraints on $ a $, $ b $, or $ c $. The problem only specifies that the vertex is given, and that $ a + b + c $ is integer. Since we derived $ a $ based on the vertex and the integer condition, it should be okay. But let me check if there's something else. For example, maybe the coefficients $ b $ and $ c $ have to be real numbers? Well, they will be as long as $ a $ is real, which it is. So no problem there.\n\nBut let me check if the vertex is indeed correct when $ a = 2/9 $. The vertex of the parabola $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $ is at $ x = -b/(2a) $. From earlier, we had $ b = -a/2 $. Therefore, $ x = -(-a/2)/(2a) = (a/2)/(2a) = 1/4 $, which matches the given vertex x-coordinate. So that checks out. And the y-coordinate of the vertex is $ -9/8 $, which we already used in forming the equation, so that should be correct as well. Therefore, this seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible value of $ a $ is $ 2/9 $, which is already in lowest terms since 2 and 9 are coprime. Therefore, $ p = 2 $, $ q = 9 $, so $ p + q = 11 $.\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me check if there are other possible values of $ k $ that could lead to smaller $ a $. For example, suppose $ k $ is a non-integer? But no, the problem says $ a + b + c $ is an integer, so $ k $ must be integer. Therefore, $ k $ can't be anything else. So the minimal $ a $ is indeed 2/9.\n\nBut let me check another value. Suppose $ k = -1 $, gives $ a = 2/9 $. If we try $ k = -2 $, which is less than -1, but we had earlier that $ k > -9/8 ≈ -1.125 $. Since $ k $ must be integer, $ k = -1 $ is the smallest possible integer greater than -1.125. If we take $ k = -2 $, then:\n\n$ a = [16*(-2) + 18]/9 = (-32 + 18)/9 = (-14)/9, which is negative. But since $ a > 0 $, this is invalid. Therefore, $ k $ cannot be less than -1. Therefore, the minimal possible value is indeed at $ k = -1 $, giving $ a = 2/9 $.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $ 2 + 9 = 11 $.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check once more. The problem says \"the minimum possible value of $ a $\". Since $ a $ is positive, and with $ k = -1 $, we get $ a = 2/9 $. Is there a way to get a smaller positive $ a $ with another condition? For example, if there are multiple constraints?\n\nBut according to the derivation, the only constraint is that $ a + b + c $ must be integer, which translates into $ a = (16k + 18)/9 $. Therefore, the minimal positive $ a $ occurs at the minimal allowed $ k $, which is $ -1 $, leading to $ 2/9 $. Therefore, unless there is a mistake in my derivation, this should be correct.\n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. Let me compute $ a = 2/9 $, then compute $ b $ and $ c $:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n$ b = -a/2 = -(2/9)/2 = -1/9 $.\n\n$ c = a/16 - 9/8 = (2/9)/16 - 9/8 = 2/(9*16) - 9/8 = 1/(72) - 9/8.\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 72:\n\n1/72 - (9/8)*(9/9) = 1/72 - 81/72 = -80/72 = -10/9.\n\nTherefore, $ c = -10/9 $.\n\nTherefore, $ a + b + c = 2/9 - 1/9 -10/9 = (2 - 1 -10)/9 = (-9)/9 = -1, which is integer. So that works.\n\nNow, let me check if the vertex is indeed correct. The vertex x-coordinate is at -b/(2a) = -(-1/9)/(2*(2/9)) = (1/9)/(4/9) = 1/4, which is correct. The y-coordinate is -9/8. Let me compute it using the standard form. The y-coordinate of the vertex can be calculated by plugging x = 1/4 into the equation:\n\n$ y = a(1/4)^2 + b(1/4) + c $.\n\nCompute:\n\n$ a*(1/16) + b*(1/4) + c $.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n$ (2/9)(1/16) + (-1/9)(1/4) + (-10/9) $.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nFirst term: 2/(9*16) = 2/144 = 1/72.\n\nSecond term: -1/(9*4) = -1/36.\n\nThird term: -10/9.\n\nConvert all to 72 denominator:\n\nFirst term: 1/72.\n\nSecond term: -2/72.\n\nThird term: -80/72.\n\nAdding them up: (1 - 2 - 80)/72 = (-81)/72 = -9/8. Correct. Therefore, the vertex is indeed at -9/8. Therefore, all checks out.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of $ a $ is 2/9, so $ p = 2 $, $ q = 9 $, which are coprime, so $ p + q = 11 $. Therefore, the answer is 11.\n\nBut wait, let me check again if there is a possibility of a smaller $ a $. For example, if there is another expression for $ a + b + c $. Wait, no, we derived that $ a + b + c = 9a/16 - 9/8 $, which must be integer. Therefore, solving for $ a $, we get that expression. Therefore, unless there is a different way to model the problem, this should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another approach. Let me try another way.\n\nSuppose we consider that $ a + b + c $ is the value of the quadratic at $ x = 1 $, because $ y(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c $. Therefore, $ a + b + c $ is the y-value of the parabola at $ x = 1 $. Therefore, since the vertex is at $ (1/4, -9/8) $, and the parabola opens upwards (since $ a > 0 $), the minimum value is -9/8. Therefore, the value at $ x = 1 $ must be greater than or equal to -9/8. However, since $ a + b + c $ is an integer, and we found that $ a + b + c = k $, which is integer. However, this seems consistent with our previous result. But perhaps this gives another way to think about the problem.\n\nBut in this case, since $ a + b + c $ is the value at $ x = 1 $, which is some integer. Since the minimum of the parabola is -9/8 ≈ -1.125, then $ a + b + c $ must be greater than or equal to -1.125. Since $ a + b + c $ is integer, the minimal possible integer greater than or equal to -1.125 is -1. Therefore, the minimal possible value of $ a + b + c $ is -1. Which is exactly what we found when $ k = -1 $. Therefore, this confirms that the minimal $ a $ occurs when $ a + b + c = -1 $, which is the smallest possible integer satisfying the condition. Therefore, this gives us the same result. Therefore, 2/9 is indeed the minimal value of $ a $.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. So $ p + q = 2 + 9 = 11 $.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>"}
