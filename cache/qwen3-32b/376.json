Hmm, let me think. I remember that logarithms are about figuring out exponents. So log₂64 means \"2 raised to what power gives me 64?\" Right? So I need to find some exponent x where 2^x = 64. \n\nLet me start by recalling the powers of 2. Let's see... 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32... Hmm, okay. So 2^5 is 32. Then 2^6 would be 64, right? Because 32 times 2 is 64. So that means 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the exponent x that I'm looking for is 6. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I take 2 and multiply it by itself six times: 2*2=4, *2=8, *2=16, *2=32, *2=64. Yep, that's five multiplications, but since we start counting from 2^1 as the first power, 2^6 would indeed be the sixth power. So 2^6 equals 64. Therefore, log base 2 of 64 is 6. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in my reasoning. Sometimes when numbers are familiar, it's easy to think you know the answer without verifying. Let's try another approach. Maybe using logarithm properties? For example, I know that log_b(a) = log_c(a)/log_c(b) for any c. But that might complicate things here. Alternatively, since 64 is a power of 2, maybe I can express it as such. \n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of binary. Since 2^6 is 64, and in binary, 64 is represented as a 1 followed by six zeros, which is 1000000 in binary. But maybe that's more computer science than math here. \n\nWait, another way: prime factorization. Let's factor 64. 64 divided by 2 is 32, divided by 2 is 16, divided by 2 is 8, divided by 2 is 4, divided by 2 is 2, divided by 2 is 1. So how many 2s did I use? Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So 64 is 2^6. Therefore, log base 2 of 64 is 6. \n\nThat seems consistent. All different methods are pointing to the same answer. Maybe I can also recall that 2^10 is 1024, which is 2^10, so 2^5 is half of that, which is 512? Wait, no, 2^5 is 32. Wait, no, 2^10 is 1024, so 2^5 is sqrt(2^10) which is sqrt(1024) which is 32. So 2^5=32, 2^6=64. Yeah, that's right. \n\nAnother thought: if I remember that 2^10 is 1024, which is close to a thousand, then maybe I can use that as a reference. Since 64 is much smaller, 2^6 is 64, so that's 6. \n\nAlternatively, if I use logarithm rules. Suppose I don't remember the powers of 2. Let's say I write log₂64 = x. Then converting to exponential form: 2^x = 64. Now, if I don't remember what power of 2 gives 64, maybe I can take another logarithm. For example, take log base 10 of both sides. \n\nlog(2^x) = log(64)\n\nx * log(2) = log(64)\n\nTherefore, x = log(64)/log(2). If I calculate that using a calculator... Well, I don't have a calculator here, but maybe I can compute log(64) and log(2). Wait, log(2) is approximately 0.3010, and log(64)... Well, log(64) is log(2^6) which is 6*log(2). Therefore, substituting back, x = 6*log(2)/log(2) = 6. So that also gives me 6. \n\nSo even if I use the change of base formula, I still get 6. That seems solid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use natural logarithm. ln(64)/ln(2). Again, ln(64) is ln(2^6) = 6*ln(2). Therefore, dividing by ln(2) gives 6. Same result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, it seems that log₂64 is 6. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's any chance I confused 64 with another number. For example, 64 is 8 squared, right? 8^2=64. So log base 8 of 64 is 2. But log base 2 of 64 is different. Since 8 is 2^3, so log base 2 of 64 is log base 2 of (8^2) which is 2*log₂8. And log₂8 is 3, so 2*3=6. Yep, same answer. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of 64 as 4 cubed, since 4^3=64. Then log base 2 of 4^3 is 3*log₂4. And log₂4 is 2, so 3*2=6. Again, same answer. \n\nSo multiple ways of breaking down 64 into exponents with different bases, but converting them back to base 2 always gives me that the exponent is 6. \n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say that log₂64 is 6. I don't see any contradictions in my reasoning, and all different approaches lead to the same conclusion. \n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Direct calculation of powers of 2 shows 2^6=64.\n- Prime factorization of 64 is 2^6.\n- Using logarithm properties and change of base formula still gives 6.\n- Expressing 64 as powers of other numbers (8, 4) and converting to base 2 also results in 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\log_2 64$ is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>"}
