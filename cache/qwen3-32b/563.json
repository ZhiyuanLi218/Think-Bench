And then find 24 times cotangent squared x. Alright, let me start by recalling some logarithm properties. \n\nFirst, remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So if I rewrite the given equation in exponential form, that might help. Let me write that down:\n\nlog_{24 sin x}(24 cos x) = 3/2  \n=> (24 sin x)^{3/2} = 24 cos x.\n\nHmm, okay. So (24 sin x) raised to the 3/2 power equals 24 cos x. Let me think about how to simplify this equation. \n\nFirst, maybe I can express both sides in terms of sin x and cos x. Let me note that 24 is a common factor here. Let me write the left-hand side:\n\n(24 sin x)^{3/2} = (24)^{3/2} * (sin x)^{3/2}\n\nAnd the right-hand side is 24 cos x. So:\n\n(24)^{3/2} * (sin x)^{3/2} = 24 cos x.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can divide both sides by 24 to simplify? Let me try that:\n\n(24)^{3/2} / 24 * (sin x)^{3/2} = cos x  \n=> (24)^{1/2} * (sin x)^{3/2} = cos x.\n\nSo that simplifies to sqrt(24) * (sin x)^{3/2} = cos x. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the fractional exponents? Let me try that. If I square both sides:\n\n[sqrt(24) * (sin x)^{3/2}]^2 = (cos x)^2  \n=> 24 * (sin x)^3 = cos^2 x.\n\nSo that gives me 24 sin^3 x = cos^2 x. \n\nAlright, so now I have an equation involving sin x and cos x. Since the problem asks for cot^2 x, which is (cos^2 x)/(sin^2 x), maybe I can express everything in terms of sin x or cos x and solve for the ratio.\n\nLet me note that cos^2 x = 1 - sin^2 x. So maybe I can substitute that into the equation. Let me try that:\n\n24 sin^3 x = 1 - sin^2 x.\n\nSo:\n\n24 sin^3 x + sin^2 x - 1 = 0.\n\nHmm, so this is a cubic equation in terms of sin x. Let me let y = sin x. Then the equation becomes:\n\n24 y^3 + y^2 - 1 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve 24y³ + y² - 1 = 0. Hmm, solving cubic equations can be tricky. Let me see if I can factor this or find rational roots. \n\nBy the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. So possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/3, ±1/4, ±1/6, ±1/8, ±1/12, ±1/24. Let me test these.\n\nFirst, test y = 1: 24(1)^3 + (1)^2 - 1 = 24 + 1 - 1 = 24 ≠ 0. Nope.\n\ny = -1: 24(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 -1 = -24 + 1 -1 = -24 ≠ 0. Nope.\n\ny = 1/2: 24*(1/2)^3 + (1/2)^2 -1 = 24*(1/8) + 1/4 -1 = 3 + 0.25 -1 = 2.25 ≠ 0.\n\ny = -1/2: 24*(-1/2)^3 + (-1/2)^2 -1 = 24*(-1/8) + 1/4 -1 = -3 + 0.25 -1 = -3.75 ≠ 0.\n\ny = 1/3: 24*(1/3)^3 + (1/3)^2 -1 = 24*(1/27) + 1/9 -1 ≈ 24/27 + 3/27 - 27/27 = (24 + 3 -27)/27 = 0/27 = 0. Oh! Wait, that works!\n\nSo y = 1/3 is a root. Therefore, (y - 1/3) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor this cubic.\n\nLet me do polynomial division. Let me divide 24y³ + y² -1 by (y - 1/3). Alternatively, since fractions can be messy, maybe multiply through by 3 to make it easier? Let me consider that.\n\nLet me let z = 3y. Then y = z/3. Substitute into the equation:\n\n24*(z/3)^3 + (z/3)^2 -1 = 0  \n24*(z³/27) + z²/9 -1 = 0  \n(24/27) z³ + (1/9) z² -1 = 0  \n(8/9) z³ + (1/9) z² -1 = 0  \nMultiply both sides by 9:  \n8 z³ + z² - 9 = 0.\n\nHmm, so the equation becomes 8z³ + z² - 9 = 0. Since y = 1/3 is a root, z = 1. Let me check if z = 1 is a root:\n\n8(1)^3 + (1)^2 -9 = 8 + 1 -9 = 0. Yes! Perfect. So z - 1 is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division on 8z³ + z² -9 divided by (z - 1). Wait, but actually, since we have a cubic equation, and we know z=1 is a root, let's factor it.\n\nUsing synthetic division for z=1:\n\nCoefficients: 8, 1, 0, -9. Wait, original polynomial is 8z³ + z² + 0z -9.\n\nBring down the 8.\n\nMultiply by 1: 8\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 1 + 8 = 9\n\nMultiply by 1: 9\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 0 + 9 = 9\n\nMultiply by 1: 9\n\nAdd to last coefficient: -9 + 9 = 0. Perfect.\n\nSo the quotient polynomial is 8z² + 9z + 9. Therefore, 8z³ + z² -9 = (z - 1)(8z² + 9z + 9). Therefore, going back to y:\n\nOriginal equation in z: (z - 1)(8z² + 9z + 9) = 0. Therefore, solutions are z=1 and roots of 8z² + 9z + 9 = 0. But z = 3y, so:\n\nz = 1 => y = 1/3.\n\nFor the quadratic equation 8z² + 9z + 9 = 0, discriminant is 81 - 4*8*9 = 81 - 288 = -207 < 0. So only real solution is z=1, so y=1/3. Therefore, sin x = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, sin x = 1/3. Then, since x is in [0, π/2], cos x is positive. So cos x = sqrt(1 - sin²x) = sqrt(1 - 1/9) = sqrt(8/9) = 2√2 / 3.\n\nTherefore, cot x = cos x / sin x = (2√2 / 3) / (1/3) = 2√2. Therefore, cot²x = (2√2)^2 = 8. Therefore, 24 cot²x = 24 * 8 = 192.\n\nWait, so is that the answer? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from log_{24 sin x}(24 cos x) = 3/2. Converted to exponential form, got (24 sin x)^{3/2} = 24 cos x. Then squared both sides to get 24^3 sin^3 x = 24^2 cos² x? Wait, wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal equation after dividing by 24:\n\nsqrt(24) * (sin x)^{3/2} = cos x.\n\nThen squaring both sides:\n\n[sqrt(24) * (sin x)^{3/2}]^2 = cos²x  \n=> 24 * sin³x = cos²x. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen replacing cos²x with 1 - sin²x:\n\n24 sin³x = 1 - sin²x  \n=> 24 sin³x + sin²x - 1 = 0. Correct.\n\nLet y = sin x, so 24y³ + y² -1 = 0. Then found that y=1/3 is a root. Then factoring led me to sin x = 1/3, then calculated cos x as 2√2/3, so cot x = 2√2, squared is 8, times 24 is 192. \n\nBut let me check if plugging back into original equation works. Let me verify.\n\nLet me compute 24 sin x = 24*(1/3) = 8. And 24 cos x = 24*(2√2/3) = 8*2√2 = 16√2. Then log base 8 of 16√2 equals 3/2?\n\nLet me check. Let me compute 8^{3/2} = (8^{1/2})^3 = (2√2)^3 = 8 * 2√2 = 16√2. Which is exactly 24 cos x. Therefore yes, it checks out. Therefore the answer is 24 cot²x = 192. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that there are no other solutions. The cubic equation had only one real root, y=1/3, so that's the only solution for sin x in real numbers. And since x is in [0, π/2], sin x ranges from 0 to 1, so 1/3 is valid. Therefore, this is the only solution. Therefore, the answer is 192. \n\nBut let me check once more. Let me compute cot x. If sin x = 1/3, then opposite = 1, hypotenuse = 3, adjacent = sqrt(3² - 1²) = sqrt(8) = 2√2. Therefore, cot x is adjacent/opposite = 2√2 / 1 = 2√2. Then squared is 8. Multiply by 24: 24*8=192. Yep. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 192.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{192}\n</think>"}
