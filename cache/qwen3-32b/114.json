Let me start by recalling what the absolute value of a complex number means. If I have a complex number a + bi, its absolute value is the square root of (a² + b²). That gives the distance from the origin on the complex plane, right?\n\nSo first, maybe I should find the absolute value of (1 - i) first and then raise it to the 8th power? Because I remember that |z^n| = |z|^n for complex numbers. Is that correct? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose z = i, so |i| = 1. Then |i^2| = |-1| = 1, which is 1² = 1. Yeah, that seems to work. So maybe I can use that property here.\n\nAlright, so let me compute |1 - i|. The real part is 1, and the imaginary part is -1. So the absolute value would be sqrt(1² + (-1)²) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). So |1 - i| is sqrt(2). Then |(1 - i)^8| should be |1 - i|^8 = (sqrt(2))^8. Let me compute that. \n\n(sqrt(2))^8 can be written as (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(8*(1/2)) = 2^4 = 16. So is the answer 16? Wait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should verify by expanding (1 - i)^8 directly? Let me try that as a check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using polar form would help? Let me recall that complex numbers can be expressed in polar form as r*(cosθ + i sinθ), where r is the absolute value and θ is the argument. Then, raising it to a power can be done using De Moivre's theorem: [r*(cosθ + i sinθ)]^n = r^n*(cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ)). Then the absolute value of that would be r^n, since cos(nθ)^2 + sin(nθ)^2 = 1. So again, the absolute value would be r^n, which is the same as |z|^n. So this confirms the property I used earlier. \n\nSo whether I do it directly, using properties of absolute values, or through polar form, I should get the same answer. Let me just go through the polar form method step by step.\n\nFirst, find the absolute value of 1 - i, which we already did: sqrt(2). Then find the argument θ. The complex number 1 - i is in the fourth quadrant. The argument is the angle it makes with the positive real axis. Since the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is -1, the reference angle is arctangent(|imaginary| / real) = arctangent(1/1) = π/4. Since it's in the fourth quadrant, the argument θ is -π/4 or equivalently 7π/4.\n\nSo in polar form, 1 - i is sqrt(2)*(cos(-π/4) + i sin(-π/4)). Then raising this to the 8th power, we have [sqrt(2)]^8 * [cos(8*(-π/4)) + i sin(8*(-π/4))]. The absolute value of this is [sqrt(2)]^8, which we already calculated as 16. The angle part doesn't affect the absolute value, since when you take the absolute value of a complex number in polar form, it's just r. So that confirms again that the answer is 16.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should compute (1 - i)^8 directly by expanding it. Let's see. Maybe using binomial theorem?\n\n(1 - i)^8. Let me compute step by step. First, compute (1 - i)^2, then square that result to get the 4th power, then square again for the 8th power. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, (1 - i)^2. Using formula (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 1² - 2*(1)*(i) + (i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i². Since i² is -1, so this becomes 1 - 2i -1 = (1 - 1) - 2i = 0 - 2i = -2i. Okay, so (1 - i)^2 is -2i.\n\nNow, let's compute (1 - i)^4 = [ (1 - i)^2 ]^2 = (-2i)^2. Let's compute that. (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2 * (i)^2 = 4 * (-1) = -4. So (1 - i)^4 is -4.\n\nThen (1 - i)^8 is [ (1 - i)^4 ]^2 = (-4)^2 = 16. So there we go. Direct computation gives 16 as well. So the absolute value of 16 is just 16, since it's a real number. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 16.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the direct computation steps. Let me check again:\n\n(1 - i)^2: 1 - 2i + i² = 1 - 2i - 1 = -2i. Correct.\n\nThen (-2i)^2: (-2)^2 * i² = 4 * (-1) = -4. Correct.\n\nThen (-4)^2 is 16. Correct. So that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I use binomial theorem for (1 - i)^8, it might be more tedious, but let's see if we can do a quick check.\n\nThe binomial expansion of (1 - i)^8 is the sum from k=0 to 8 of C(8, k) * 1^(8 - k) * (-i)^k.\n\nWhich is sum_{k=0}^8 C(8, k) (-i)^k.\n\nBut since we know that (1 - i)^8 is 16, which is a real number, so all the imaginary parts must cancel out. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the modulus squared? Wait, but we already have the answer. However, just to make sure, if I compute modulus squared of (1 - i)^8, which is |(1 - i)^8|^2 = |(1 - i)|^{16} = (sqrt(2))^{16} = 2^8 = 256. But also, if I compute (1 - i)^8 = 16, then |16|^2 = 256. So that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, modulus squared of (1 - i)^8 is [(1 - i)^8] * [conj(1 - i)^8] = [(1 - i) * conj(1 - i)]^8 = |1 - i|^{16} same as before. So that also gives 256. Which is consistent with 16 * conj(16) = 16*16=256. So that checks out. \n\nSo all methods lead me to believe that the answer is 16. Therefore, Ringo should have found 16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{16}\n</think>"}
