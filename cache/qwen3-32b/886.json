So, the question is about a nuclear reaction where a nucleus X is bombarded with neutrons to produce alpha particles and another nucleus Y. Then, we have to determine which of the given statements (A-D) are correct based on the information provided. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the nuclear reaction as given:\n\nX (which is represented as _Z^N X) + neutron (_0^1 n) → Y (_p^7 Y) + alpha particle (_2^4 He)\n\nWe are told that element Y exhibits a +1 valence in compounds. So, we need to figure out what elements X and Y are, and then check the options.\n\nLet me recall that in nuclear reactions, both mass number and atomic number (protons) must balance on both sides. So, let's apply the conservation laws here.\n\nThe initial side (left) has:\n\n- X with atomic number Z and mass number N.\n- Neutron with atomic number 0 and mass number 1.\n\nTotal mass number on the left: N + 1\nTotal atomic number on the left: Z + 0 = Z\n\nOn the product side (right):\n\n- Y with atomic number p and mass number 7.\n- Alpha particle with atomic number 2 and mass number 4.\n\nTotal mass number on the right: 7 + 4 = 11\nTotal atomic number on the right: p + 2\n\nSince mass number and atomic number must be conserved, we can set up equations:\n\nFor mass number:\nN + 1 = 11 ⇒ N = 10\n\nFor atomic number:\nZ = p + 2 ⇒ Z = p + 2\n\nSo, the original nucleus X has mass number 10 and atomic number Z = p + 2.\n\nNow, we are also told that element Y exhibits a +1 valence. Valence is related to the number of electrons an atom can lose, gain, or share in chemical reactions. A +1 valence suggests that Y tends to lose one electron, which is characteristic of elements in Group 1 (alkali metals), such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), etc. These elements have one valence electron and typically form +1 ions.\n\nSo, if Y is an alkali metal, then its atomic number p corresponds to one of these elements.\n\nNow, let's look at the mass number of Y, which is 7. Wait, the product Y is given as _p^7 Y. So the mass number of Y is 7. So we need to find an alkali metal with mass number 7.\n\nBut wait, let me think. The mass number is the number of protons plus neutrons. So, for Y, mass number is 7. Since Y is an alkali metal, let's check the atomic numbers of alkali metals and see which one would have a mass number of 7.\n\nThe alkali metals are:\n\n- Lithium (Li): atomic number 3\n- Sodium (Na): 11\n- Potassium (K): 19\n- Rubidium (Rb): 37\n- Cesium (Cs): 55\n- Francium (Fr): 87\n\nSo, for example, lithium-7 is a common isotope of lithium. Its mass number is 7 (3 protons + 4 neutrons). So if Y is lithium, then p = 3. Then, since Z = p + 2, Z would be 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the original element X would have atomic number 5 (which is boron, B) and mass number N = 10. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nSo, if X is boron-10 (which has 5 protons and 5 neutrons), and it's bombarded with a neutron, the reaction would be:\n\n^10_5B + ^1_0n → ^7_3Li + ^4_2He\n\nLet me check if the mass numbers add up: 10 + 1 = 11 on the left; 7 + 4 = 11 on the right. Good. Atomic numbers: 5 on the left; 3 + 2 = 5 on the right. Perfect. So that works.\n\nTherefore, Y is lithium (Li), with atomic number 3 and mass number 7. X is boron (B), atomic number 5, mass number 10.\n\nNow, let's check the options given.\n\nOption A: H3XO3 can be used to neutralize NaOH solution splashed on the skin.\n\nX is boron, so H3XO3 would be H3BO3, which is boric acid. Boric acid is a weak acid and is used in some antiseptics and as a mild antiseptic. However, if NaOH (a strong base) is splashed on the skin, typically, you would use a weak acid to neutralize it. However, boric acid is indeed used for this purpose. However, I should verify if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the more common treatment is to rinse with water and then use something like vinegar (acetic acid) if necessary, but in some cases, boric acid solutions are used as a neutralizing agent. However, I need to be careful here. Let me think. But the question is about whether H3XO3 (boric acid) can be used. So if X is boron, then yes. But I need to check if boric acid is indeed used for neutralizing NaOH. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is no? Wait, but the question is phrased as \"can be used to neutralize...\" So perhaps it's correct? Let me note this and come back after checking other options.\n\nOption B: The combustion product of element Y in air is Y2O2.\n\nY is lithium. When alkali metals burn in air, they form oxides, peroxides, or superoxides depending on the metal. Lithium, being the lightest, typically forms the oxide, not the peroxide. For example, 4 Li + O2 → 2 Li2O. So the product is Li2O, not Li2O2. Therefore, option B is incorrect. The combustion product would be Y2O (Li2O), not Y2O2. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: X forms an ionic compound with the hydrogen element.\n\nX is boron. Boron typically forms covalent compounds with hydrogen, such as borane (BH3), but BH3 is a highly reactive molecule and tends to dimerize or form more complex structures. However, under certain conditions, boron can form ionic compounds with hydrogen. Wait, but more commonly, boron is a metalloid and tends to form covalent bonds. However, when it reacts with hydrogen, it forms covalent hydrides. For example, diborane (B2H6) is a covalent compound. So, ionic compounds are more characteristic of metals. Since boron is a metalloid, it's more likely to form covalent hydrides. Therefore, option C would be incorrect. Unless there's some specific ionic compound, but I don't recall boron forming ionic hydrides. Therefore, option C is likely incorrect.\n\nOption D: ^6Y and ^7Y are allotropes of each other.\n\nAllotropes are different structural forms of the same element. For example, carbon has allotropes like diamond, graphite, etc. However, ^6Y and ^7Y refer to isotopes, not allotropes. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. Since Y is lithium, ^6Li and ^7Li are isotopes. So option D is incorrect because they are isotopes, not allotropes. Therefore, D is wrong.\n\nNow, back to option A. If X is boron, then H3XO3 is H3BO3, which is boric acid. Boric acid is indeed used in some antiseptic solutions and can be used to neutralize strong bases like NaOH on the skin. However, in practice, the first aid for NaOH on the skin is to rinse with plenty of water, and then if necessary, use a weak acid. However, boric acid is sometimes used for this purpose. For example, in some first aid guidelines, boric acid solutions are mentioned as a neutralizing agent for alkali burns. However, I need to check if this is accurate. Alternatively, maybe it's not commonly used for that. But according to the question's context, if the option says it can be used, and assuming that the question is correct, then A would be correct. However, I need to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct neutralizing agent is something else. Let me think. For example, sulfuric acid is not used because it's a strong acid. Acetic acid (vinegar) is a weak acid and is sometimes recommended. But boric acid is also a weak acid. So, if you have boric acid available, it could be used. Therefore, the statement in option A is correct. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nSo, based on the above analysis, the correct options are A.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The options are (A), (B), (C), (D). From my analysis, A is correct, B is wrong, C is wrong, D is wrong. So the correct answer is A.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me confirm the identity of X and Y once more to be sure.\n\nOriginal reaction: X + neutron → Y (mass 7) + alpha.\n\nWe found that X is boron-10 (Z=5, N=10), and Y is lithium-7 (p=3). Then Y has +1 valence, which matches lithium's +1 oxidation state. Correct.\n\nNow, H3XO3 is H3BO3. Boric acid. Yes. So A is correct. So the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as (A), (B), (C), (D). The question says \"the correct statements are\" and the options are multiple. However, in the problem statement, the user hasn't specified if multiple options can be correct. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original problem says: \"The correct statements are: Options: (A)... (B)... etc.\" So likely, only one is correct, but sometimes multiple can be correct. However, in Chinese entrance exams (like Gaokao) or similar, sometimes multiple choice questions have multiple correct answers. However, the way the problem is presented here, with options (A)-(D), and the user is to select the correct ones. Since the user hasn't specified how many are correct, but based on my analysis, only A is correct.\n\nBut let me check again for option C. X is boron. Does boron form an ionic compound with hydrogen? Well, boron tends to form covalent hydrides. However, under certain conditions, such as in the presence of electron-deficient compounds, it can form ionic hydrides? Wait, no, ionic hydrides are typically formed by alkali and alkaline earth metals. For example, NaH is an ionic hydride. Boron forms covalent hydrides. So option C is incorrect. Therefore, C is wrong.\n\nTherefore, only option A is correct. So the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check again for option B. The combustion product of Y (Li) in air is Y2O2. But lithium burns in oxygen to form Li2O. The reaction is 4 Li + O2 → 2 Li2O. So the product is Li2O, not Li2O2. Peroxides are formed by alkali metals starting from sodium. For example, sodium reacts with O2 to form Na2O2 (sodium peroxide) if burned in excess oxygen. Lithium only forms the oxide. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\nOption D says ^6Y and ^7Y are allotropes. As mentioned, they are isotopes, not allotropes. Allotropes are different forms of the element (like O2 and O3 for oxygen), not different isotopes. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about option A. H3BO3 is boric acid. Is it used to neutralize NaOH on the skin? I need to verify this. For example, if someone gets a strong base on their skin, the standard first aid is to rinse with water. Neutralization with an acid is generally not recommended because it can cause heat and further damage. However, in some cases, weak acids like boric acid or vinegar may be used after thorough rinsing. For example, boric acid is sometimes used in solutions for eye wash or skin contact with bases. However, I need to be cautious here because in real practice, it's more common to use water and not apply any neutralizing agents unless specified. However, the question is from a chemistry perspective, not necessarily real-world first aid. If the question is testing knowledge of boric acid's properties, then since it's a weak acid, it can neutralize a strong base. Therefore, technically, H3BO3 can be used to neutralize NaOH, so option A is correct. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n</think>"}
