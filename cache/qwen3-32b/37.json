{"question":"Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?

The problem is about a star with and without spots affecting the effective temperature, and how that changes the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. The answer choices are given, and I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with the ratio of populations in different energy levels in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the Saha and Boltzmann equations are involved. But since the problem is about neutral atoms in two different energy levels, maybe it's purely the Boltzmann equation that applies here. The Saha equation is more about ionization states, so if we're staying with neutral atoms, perhaps Saha isn't needed here. \n\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in different energy levels. The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels (let's say level 1 and level 2) is given by:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp[ -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ]\n\nWhere:\n- N2/N1 is the ratio of populations in level 2 to level 1,\n- g2/g1 is the ratio of statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels,\n- E2 - E1 is the energy difference between the levels,\n- k is Boltzmann's constant,\n- T is the temperature.\n\nBut the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That is, when there are spots (lower temperature, 5500 K), the ratio N2/N1 is smaller than when there are no spots (higher temperature, 6000 K). Wait, actually the question says \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)... this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\" So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is smaller than when it doesn't have spots (T=6000 K). Therefore, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it has spots (T=5500 K). So we need to compute (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_spots.\n\nAssuming that the energy levels are fixed (so E2 - E1 is the same in both cases), and the only thing changing is the temperature. Also, assuming that the statistical weights g2/g1 are constants, so they cancel out when taking the ratio of the ratios. Therefore, the factor would be:\n\nFactor = [ (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) ] \n\nWhich simplifies to exp[ -ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) ) ] = exp[ ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ]\n\nWhere T1 is the temperature when there are no spots (6000 K), and T2 is when there are spots (5500 K). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, if T1 is the higher temperature (6000 K) and T2 is lower (5500 K), then:\n\nFactor = exp[ ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ]\n\nBut let me make sure. Let me define:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nWhen no spots: T1 = 6000 K\n\nWhen spots: T2 = 5500 K\n\nThe ratio when no spots is R1 = N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )\n\nWhen spots: R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )\n\nTherefore, the factor we need is R1/R2 = exp[ -ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) ) ] = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, we need to compute ΔE. The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Since energy difference ΔE is related to the wavelength λ by ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nSo first, compute ΔE.\n\nGiven λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10^-10 m (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m).\n\nh = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s\n\nc = 3.0 × 10^8 m/s\n\nSo ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = approx 1.9878e-25 J·m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m:\n\nΔE ≈ 1.9878e-25 / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.9878 / 1.448 * 1e-18 J ≈ approx 1.372 * 1e-18 J\n\nLet me compute more accurately:\n\n1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373 (since 1.448 * 1.37 ≈ 1.98)\n\nSo ΔE ≈ 1.373 × 10^-18 J.\n\nNow, we need to compute ΔE/(k*(1/T2 - 1/T1))? Wait no, the exponent is ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Let me write:\n\nLet me compute the exponent first:\n\nΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) \n\nWe can compute this value. Let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, let's compute ΔE in terms of eV to make it easier with Boltzmann constant? Or maybe convert k to J/K.\n\nBoltzmann constant k = 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K.\n\nSo let's compute ΔE / k:\n\n(1.373 × 10^-18 J) / (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) × 10^5 K ≈ approx 0.995 × 1e5 ≈ 9.95 × 10^4 K.\n\nThen multiply by (1/T2 - 1/T1):\n\nCompute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 1/5500 - 1/6000.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nConvert to decimal:\n\n1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1\n\n1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1\n\nSubtracting: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1\n\nSo the exponent is:\n\n≈ 9.95 × 10^4 K * 0.000015151 K^-1 ≈ 9.95 × 10^4 * 1.5151 × 10^-5 ≈ \n\nMultiply 9.95 * 1.5151 ≈ approx 15.07, and then 10^4 * 10^-5 = 10^-1, so total ≈ 15.07 * 0.1 ≈ 1.507\n\nTherefore, the exponent is approximately 1.507, so the factor is e^1.507 ≈ ?\n\ne^1.5 is about 4.48, and e^1.6 is about 4.95. Since 1.507 is slightly above 1.5, maybe around 4.5?\n\nBut let me check more accurately.\n\nFirst, let's redo the calculation step by step with more precise numbers.\n\nStarting with ΔE:\n\nλ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10^-10 m = 1.448 × 10^-7 m\n\nΔE = hc / λ\n\nh = 6.62607015 × 10^-34 J·s (exact value, but for estimation purposes, 6.626e-34)\n\nc = 2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 3.0 × 10^8 m/s\n\nSo ΔE ≈ (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nNow, ΔE / k = 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K ≈ 1.373 / 1.38 * 1e5 ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 9.95e4 K\n\nNow, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1):\n\nT1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K\n\nCompute 1/5500 - 1/6000:\n\nFind common denominator, which is 5500*6000.\n\nBut let's compute numerically:\n\n1/5500 ≈ 0.00018181818...\n\n1/6000 ≈ 0.00016666666...\n\nSubtracting gives ≈ 0.0000151515...\n\nWhich is approximately 1.51515 × 10^-5 K^-1\n\nSo multiplying:\n\n9.95e4 K * 1.51515e-5 K^-1 = 9.95 * 1.51515 * 1e4 * 1e-5 = 9.95 * 1.51515 * 0.1\n\nCalculate 9.95 * 1.51515:\n\nFirst, 10 * 1.51515 = 15.1515\n\nMinus 0.05 * 1.51515 ≈ 0.0757575\n\nSo ≈ 15.1515 - 0.0757575 ≈ 15.0757\n\nMultiply by 0.1: ≈ 1.50757\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5076\n\nNow compute e^1.5076.\n\nWe know that e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817\n\nWhat is e^1.5076?\n\nLet me recall that e^x can be approximated using Taylor series around x=1.5, but perhaps better to remember that ln(4.5) ≈ ?\n\nLet me check ln(4.5):\n\nWe know that ln(4) ≈ 1.386, ln(e) = 1, e^1.5 ≈ 4.48, so ln(4.5) is slightly more than 1.5.\n\nCompute ln(4.5):\n\nLet me recall that ln(4.5) = ln(9/2) = ln(9) - ln(2) = 2.1972 - 0.6931 ≈ 1.5041\n\nAh! So ln(4.5) ≈ 1.5041\n\nOur exponent is 1.5076, which is 1.5076 - 1.5041 = 0.0035 higher than ln(4.5). Therefore:\n\ne^1.5076 = e^{ln(4.5) + 0.0035} = 4.5 * e^{0.0035} ≈ 4.5 * (1 + 0.0035) ≈ 4.5 * 1.0035 ≈ 4.51575\n\nTherefore, approximately 4.52.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D is ~4.5. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\nBut let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let me verify the exponent again.\n\nWait, the exponent was approximately 1.5076, and since ln(4.5) ≈ 1.5041, so e^1.5076 ≈ 4.5 * e^0.0035 ≈ 4.5 * 1.0035 ≈ 4.515. So yes, about 4.5. Therefore, answer D: ~4.5.\n\nBut let me check if I messed up the temperatures. The problem says that when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K). The ratio N2/N1 is lower when the temperature is lower. Let me confirm that the factor is R1/R2 = e^{ΔE/(k)(1/T2 - 1/T1)}.\n\nSince T2 is lower (5500 K), 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive. And ΔE is positive because E2 > E1 (since the transition is from level 1 to level 2, assuming that the wavelength given is for the transition from level 1 to level 2). Therefore, the exponent is positive, so the factor is greater than 1. Which makes sense because when temperature increases, the population in higher energy levels increases, so N2/N1 increases. Therefore, when the star doesn't have spots (higher T), the ratio is higher, so R1/R2 is greater than 1. So our calculation of ~4.5 means that the ratio when no spots is ~4.5 times higher than when there are spots. Which matches the problem statement that the ratio decreases when there are spots. Therefore, the factor by which it changes (no spots vs spots) is ~4.5, which is answer D.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in the energy calculation. Let me recalculate ΔE.\n\nGiven λ = 1448 Å. Let's convert that to meters: 1448 × 10^-10 m = 1.448 × 10^-7 m.\n\nCompute ΔE = hc / λ.\n\nh = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s\n\nc = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nSo hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m\n\nDivide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J. Correct.\n\nConvert this to eV for better understanding? Maybe not necessary, but just to check.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE in eV is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference is about 8.57 eV. That seems plausible for an atomic transition? Well, transitions in the ultraviolet (since 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the extreme ultraviolet). For example, the Lyman alpha line of hydrogen is at 121.6 nm, which is higher energy (about 10.2 eV). So 8.57 eV is lower, maybe in the UV range. It's plausible.\n\nNow, with ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV, let's check the exponent again using another approach.\n\nThe exponent is ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). But ΔE is in eV, so maybe converting k to eV/K would be better.\n\nk = 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K.\n\nSo ΔE/k = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 8.57 / 8.617 * 1e5 ≈ approx 0.9945 * 1e5 ≈ 9.945 × 10^4 K. Which matches our previous calculation. Then multiplied by (1/5500 - 1/6000) ≈ 1.515e-5 K^-1 gives 9.945e4 * 1.515e-5 ≈ same as before, ~1.507. So e^1.507 ≈ 4.5. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, answer D: ~4.5.\n\nBut let me check the answer choices again. The options are A:~2.9, B:~1.1, C:~7.8, D:~4.5. So D is the correct one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n</think>"}
