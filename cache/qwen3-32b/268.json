The options are proton, neutron, electron, or particle. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basics about nuclear reactions.\n\nFirst, in nuclear reactions, both the mass number (the superscript) and the atomic number (the subscript, which isn't written here but I might need to add) should balance on both sides. That means the sum of the mass numbers on the left should equal the sum on the right, and the same goes for the atomic numbers.\n\nLet me write down the elements with their symbols properly. Helium-4 is ⁴He, Nitrogen-14 is ¹⁴N, and Oxygen-17 is ¹⁷O. Now, I need to figure out what X is. \n\nFirst, let's check the mass numbers. On the left side, we have 4 (from He) + 14 (from N) = 18. On the right side, we have 17 (from O) plus the mass number of X. So 17 + A(X) = 18. Therefore, A(X) = 1. So the mass number of X is 1.\n\nNow, the atomic numbers. Let me recall the atomic numbers of these elements. Helium has an atomic number of 2 (since it has 2 protons). Nitrogen has an atomic number of 7. Oxygen has an atomic number of 8. Let me confirm that... Yeah, periodic table: He is 2, N is 7, O is 8.\n\nSo the left side's total atomic number is 2 (from He) + 7 (from N) = 9. On the right side, we have 8 (from O) plus the atomic number of X. Therefore, 8 + Z(X) = 9. Hence, Z(X) = 1. So X has an atomic number of 1.\n\nSo X has a mass number of 1 and atomic number of 1. What particle has that? Well, a proton has a mass number of 1 and atomic number of +1 (since it's a proton). A neutron has mass number 1 but atomic number 0 (since it's neutral). An electron has negligible mass (considered 0 in these equations) and charge -1. A particle... Well, if they mean an alpha particle, that's ⁴He, but here X has mass 1. Alternatively, maybe a deuteron? No, deuteron is ²H, mass number 2. So probably not.\n\nSo with mass number 1 and atomic number 1, that's a proton. Because a proton is a hydrogen nucleus, which is ¹H, right? So ¹¹H is a proton. So X should be a proton. Therefore, the answer is option A.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me write the full equation with atomic numbers. Let me add the atomic numbers as subscripts.\n\nSo the reaction is:\n\n²⁴He + ⁷¹⁴N → ⁸¹⁷O + X\n\nSo left side: 2 + 7 = 9. Right side: 8 + Z. Therefore Z must be 1. And mass numbers: 4 + 14 = 18. Right side: 17 + A = 18. So A = 1. Therefore, X has A=1 and Z=1. Which is a proton (¹¹H). So yes, that's a proton. So the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, let me think if there's any other possibility. For example, sometimes in nuclear reactions, particles can be emitted. Let me think about the actual reaction. This reaction is similar to what Rutherford did when he discovered the proton. Let me recall: when alpha particles (helium nuclei) were bombarded on nitrogen, they produced oxygen and protons. The reaction is indeed:\n\n⁴He + ¹⁴N → ¹⁷O + ¹H (proton). So yes, this is a historical experiment. Therefore, the answer is A, proton.\n\nBut let me check if there's any chance it's a neutron. If X was a neutron, then mass numbers would be 17 + 1 = 18, which matches. But the atomic numbers would be 8 + 0 = 8, which does not equal left side's 9. Therefore, impossible. If X was a proton, then atomic numbers add up to 8 + 1 = 9. Correct. If X was an electron, then Z would be -1? No, electrons have a charge of -1, but in terms of atomic number, which is the number of protons, an electron is 0. But the mass number would be 0. However, here X has mass number 1, so electron is out. So definitely, it's a proton. So answer is A.\n</think>"}
