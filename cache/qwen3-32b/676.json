For an ideal gas, an increase in volume at constant temperature leads to a greater number of possible microstates because the gas molecules have more space to occupy, thereby increasing the system's disorder.\n\n---\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n1. **Entropy and Volume Relationship**:\n   - The entropy change for an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas is given by the formula:\n     $$\n     \\Delta S = nR \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)\n     $$\n     where:\n     - $ n $ is the number of moles,\n     - $ R $ is the gas constant,\n     - $ V_2 $ and $ V_1 $ are the final and initial volumes, respectively.\n\n   - Since the gas is being transferred from a 2.0 L flask to a **larger** container, $ V_2 > V_1 $, and the natural logarithm of a number greater than 1 is **positive**, meaning $ \\Delta S > 0 $. Therefore, **entropy increases**.\n\n2. **Physical Intuition**:\n   - When a gas expands into a larger volume, its molecules have more room to move and occupy different positions and velocities. This increase in spatial distribution corresponds to a higher degree of disorder, which is the essence of entropy.\n\n3. **Free Expansion and Irreversibility**:\n   - Even in a **free expansion** (where the gas expands into a vacuum), the entropy of the system increases. This is because entropy is a **state function**, and the final state of the system (higher volume) has greater entropy regardless of the process.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n- **Option A**: Incorrect. While the number of molecules remains the same, entropy is not solely determined by the number of molecules but also by the spatial distribution and the number of possible microstates. An increase in volume increases entropy regardless of the number of molecules.\n\n- **Option B**: Incorrect. The gas becomes more **disordered**, not more ordered, when it occupies a larger volume. Hence, entropy should increase, not decrease.\n\n- **Option C**: Incorrect. While the frequency of collisions with the container walls may decrease, entropy is not directly related to the frequency of collisions. It is more about the number of possible configurations the gas can adopt.\n\n- **Option D**: **Correct**. The gas molecules are more dispersed in the larger container, which increases the number of possible microstates and hence the entropy.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what happens to the entropy of helium gas when it's moved from a 2.0 L flask to a larger container, keeping the temperature constant. Let me start by recalling what entropy is. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. For gases, when they expand into a larger volume, the molecules have more space to move around, which generally increases the entropy because there are more possible microstates.\n\nThe question gives a specific scenario: 0.40 g of helium gas in a 2.0 L flask, then evacuated into a larger container. Temperature is held constant. The options are about whether entropy increases, decreases, or stays the same.\n\nFirst, let me think about the process. Evacuating the gas into a larger container means the volume increases. Since the temperature is constant, this is an isothermal expansion. For an ideal gas, when it expands isothermally, the entropy change can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), where n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and V2 and V1 are the final and initial volumes. Since V2 is larger than V1, the natural log of a number greater than 1 is positive, so the entropy change would be positive, meaning an increase in entropy. So that suggests the answer is D, which states that entropy will increase as the gas molecules are more dispersed.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions \"evacuated into a larger container.\" Wait, does \"evacuated\" mean that the gas is being pumped out into the larger container, or is the larger container being evacuated by the gas? Maybe the wording is a bit confusing. But regardless, the key point is that the volume the gas occupies is increasing. The original container is 2.0 L, and then it goes into a larger container. So the volume is increasing. Even if the process is free expansion (which is irreversible), the entropy change for the gas would still be the same as for a reversible isothermal expansion because entropy is a state function. So regardless of the process, the entropy change depends only on the initial and final states. Therefore, the entropy should increase.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: It remains constant because the number of molecules doesn't change. But entropy isn't just about the number of molecules, it's also about the number of microstates. Even with the same number of molecules, spreading them out increases entropy. So A is incorrect.\n\nB: It decreases because the gas is more ordered. But in a larger container, the gas is more spread out, which is more disordered, not more ordered. So B is wrong.\n\nC: It decreases because molecules collide less. Wait, the frequency of collisions might decrease, but entropy isn't directly about collision frequency. Entropy is about the number of ways the molecules can be arranged. More volume means more possible positions and momenta, hence higher entropy. So C is also incorrect.\n\nD: It increases as the molecules are more dispersed. That aligns with the reasoning. So D is correct.\n\nLet me also think about the formula. Let's calculate the number of moles of helium. The molar mass of helium is 4.00 g/mol. So 0.40 g is 0.40 / 4.00 = 0.10 mol. The initial volume is 2.0 L, and the final volume is larger. Let's say the final volume is V2. Then the entropy change is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1). Since V2 > V1, the argument of ln is greater than 1, so ln is positive, so ΔS is positive. Therefore, entropy increases. So D is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when a gas expands into a vacuum (free expansion), the entropy increases even though no heat is transferred. The process is irreversible, and the entropy of the system increases. So even if the temperature is constant, the expansion leads to higher entropy. Therefore, the answer must be D.\n</think>"}
