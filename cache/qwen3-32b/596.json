The rest masses are given: pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu+ is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, I think. The answer choices are A to D, each with two values. Let me try to work this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum should still be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p and the neutrino as -p. \n\nBut since the neutrino is massless (or nearly massless), its energy is just E = pc. The muon is massive, so its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). The total energy should be conserved. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy should equal 139.6 MeV.\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\nE_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV\n\nWhere E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) and E_nu = p c.\n\nSo substituting E_nu into the equation:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = 139.6 MeV\n\nLet me simplify by dividing both sides by c²? Wait, maybe I can factor out c. Let me define variables in terms of MeV/c for momentum and MeV for energy. Let me let p be in MeV/c, so that pc is in MeV. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = 139.6 MeV\n\nLet me denote m_mu c² as 105.7 MeV. So:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6\n\nLet me call pc as x. Then:\n\nsqrt(x² + (105.7)²) + x = 139.6\n\nSo I need to solve for x. Let me rearrange:\n\nsqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x\n\nNow square both sides:\n\nx² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)²\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n(139.6)² - 2*139.6*x + x²\n\nSo subtract x² from both sides:\n\n105.7² = (139.6)² - 2*139.6*x\n\nThen rearrange:\n\n2*139.6*x = (139.6)² - 105.7²\n\nCompute the right-hand side. Let me calculate (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2. That's a difference of squares, so it factors as (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7).\n\nCompute 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV\n\n139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3 MeV\n\nSo the product is 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 33 * 245.3 = 33*245 + 33*0.3 = 8085 + 9.9 = 8094.9\n\nThen 0.9*245.3 = 220.77\n\nTotal is 8094.9 + 220.77 = 8315.67 MeV²\n\nSo 2*139.6*x = 8315.67 MeV²\n\nTherefore, x = 8315.67 / (2*139.6)\n\nCalculate denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 83.1567 / 2.792 ≈ let me compute 2.792 * 29.7 = ?\n\nWell, 2.792 * 30 = 83.76. So 83.1567 is slightly less than 83.76. So x ≈ 30 - (83.76 - 83.1567)/2.792 ≈ 30 - 0.6033/2.792 ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784 MeV.\n\nSo x ≈ 29.78 MeV. Therefore, pc = 29.78 MeV.\n\nSo the neutrino's energy is E_nu = pc ≈ 29.78 MeV.\n\nThen the muon's energy is E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu ≈ 139.6 - 29.78 ≈ 109.82 MeV.\n\nBut the rest energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.82 - 105.7 ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n\nSo the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino. Looking at the options, option B is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, the difference of squares:\n\n(139.6 - 105.7) = 33.9, correct.\n\n(139.6 + 105.7) = 245.3, correct.\n\nMultiply 33.9 * 245.3. Let me check that again.\n\n33.9 * 245.3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n33 * 245.3 = 33 * 200 + 33 * 45.3 = 6600 + 1494.9 = 8094.9\n\n0.9 * 245.3 = 220.77\n\nTotal: 8094.9 + 220.77 = 8315.67 MeV², correct.\n\nThen 2 * 139.6 = 279.2, correct.\n\nThen x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute this division more accurately.\n\nCompute 279.2 * 29.7 = ?\n\nWell, 279.2 * 30 = 8376\n\nSubtract 279.2 * 0.3 = 83.76\n\nSo 8376 - 83.76 = 8292.24\n\nBut our numerator is 8315.67. So 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43. So how much more than 29.7?\n\nEach 1 unit of x is 279.2 MeV². Wait, no. Wait, x is in MeV. Wait, no, the value of x is 29.7... MeV? Wait, x is pc, which is in MeV. Wait, earlier I said pc is x, so x is in MeV. Then 279.2 is MeV? Wait, no, the units: Let me check.\n\nOriginal equation: 2*139.6*x = 8315.67 MeV²\n\nWait, 139.6 is in MeV, x is in MeV (since pc is in MeV if p is in MeV/c). Wait, maybe I messed up the units here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the equation was:\n\nsqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + pc = 139.6 MeV.\n\nSo pc is in units of MeV, because m_mu c² is in MeV. Therefore, x is pc in MeV. Then the equation is in MeV. Then when we did 2*139.6*x, what's the unit?\n\nWait, the equation after expanding was:\n\n105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x\n\nBut 105.7² is (MeV)^2, same with (139.6)^2. So the units are (MeV)^2. Therefore, 2*139.6*x must have units of (MeV)^2. Since 139.6 is in MeV, then x must be in MeV as well. Therefore, the equation is dimensionally consistent.\n\nTherefore, solving for x gives x in MeV. So x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute this division again with more precision.\n\nCalculate 8315.67 / 279.2:\n\nFirst, approximate 279.2 * 29.7 = ?\n\nAs above, 279.2 * 30 = 8376\n\n279.2 * 29.7 = 8376 - 279.2 * 0.3 = 8376 - 83.76 = 8292.24\n\nNow, 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43\n\nSo how much more than 29.7 is needed? The difference is 23.43 MeV². Since each 1 unit of x corresponds to 279.2 MeV², then the additional x is 23.43 / 279.2 ≈ 0.0839.\n\nTherefore, x ≈ 29.7 + 0.0839 ≈ 29.7839 MeV.\n\nSo x ≈ 29.78 MeV. Therefore, neutrino energy is 29.78 MeV, muon energy is 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV. Then kinetic energy of muon is 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV. So that's option B: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using relativistic equations for decay.\n\nAlternatively, since the pion is at rest, the energy is entirely rest mass. The decay products must have kinetic energy because their rest masses don't add up to the pion's rest mass. The neutrino is massless, so all its energy is kinetic. The muon has rest mass, so its kinetic energy is total energy minus rest energy.\n\nAnother approach: using conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momentum of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p (magnitude, direction opposite). \n\nFor the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p c. For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Then total energy:\n\nE_total = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) + p c = m_pi c^2\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So solving for p c gives us x ≈ 29.78 MeV. Therefore, the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV, and the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV. So option B.\n\nBut let me check the answer choices again:\n\nA:2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV \n\nB:4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV \n\nC:3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV \n\nD:7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV \n\nYes, B is 4.12 and 29.8. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify with another method. For example, using the formula for the kinetic energy of the decay products when the parent is at rest.\n\nIn general, for a decay of a particle at rest into two particles, the kinetic energies can be found using energy and momentum conservation. For the case where one particle is much lighter (like the neutrino), but here we have a muon and a neutrino.\n\nAlternatively, there is a formula for the kinetic energy of the muon. Let me recall.\n\nIn the case of a pion decaying into a muon and neutrino, the kinetic energy of the muon can be calculated by:\n\nKE_mu = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi) ] - m_mu ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The total energy of the muon is E_mu = (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall the formula for the kinetic energy in a two-body decay.\n\nIn general, for a particle of mass M decaying into two particles with masses m1 and m2, the kinetic energy of particle 1 is:\n\nKE1 = [ (M - m1)^2 c^4 - m2^2 c^4 ] / (2 M c^2 )\n\nWait, maybe I need to derive it.\n\nLet me consider the two-body decay. Let me denote the parent particle as having mass M (pion), and decay products as masses m1 (muon) and m2 (neutrino ≈ 0). \n\nIn the rest frame of the parent, the total momentum is zero. So the two decay products have equal and opposite momenta. Let p be the magnitude of the momentum of each.\n\nFor particle 1 (muon):\n\nE1 = sqrt( p² c² + m1² c^4 )\n\nFor particle 2 (neutrino):\n\nE2 = sqrt( p² c² + m2² c^4 ) ≈ p c, since m2 ≈ 0.\n\nEnergy conservation:\n\nE1 + E2 = M c².\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt( p² c² + m1² c^4 ) + p c = M c²\n\nDivide both sides by c²:\n\nsqrt( p² / c² + m1² ) + p / c = M\n\nLet me define p / c = x. Then:\n\nsqrt( x² + m1² ) + x = M\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. Then solving for x:\n\nsqrt(x² + m1²) = M - x\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx² + m1² = M² - 2 M x + x²\n\nCancel x²:\n\nm1² = M² - 2 M x\n\nThen:\n\n2 M x = M² - m1²\n\nx = (M² - m1²) / (2 M )\n\nTherefore, p / c = (M² - m1²) / (2 M )\n\nTherefore, the momentum p = [ (M² - m1²) / (2 M ) ] c\n\nThen the energy of the muon is E1 = sqrt( p² c² + m1² c^4 ) = sqrt( [ (M² - m1²)^2 / (4 M² ) ] c² + m1² c^4 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= c sqrt( (M^4 - 2 M² m1² + m1^4 ) / (4 M² ) + m1² )\n\n= c sqrt( [M^4 - 2 M² m1² + m1^4 + 4 M² m1² ] / (4 M² ) )\n\n= c sqrt( [M^4 + 2 M² m1² + m1^4 ] / (4 M² ) )\n\n= c sqrt( [ (M² + m1² )² ] / (4 M² ) )\n\n= c (M² + m1² ) / (2 M )\n\nTherefore, E1 = [ (M² + m1² ) / (2 M ) ] c²\n\nBut since the rest energy of the muon is m1 c², the kinetic energy is:\n\nKE1 = E1 - m1 c² = [ (M² + m1² ) / (2 M ) - m1 ] c²\n\n= [ (M² + m1² - 2 M m1 ) / (2 M ) ] c²\n\n= [ (M - m1 )² / (2 M ) ] c²\n\nTherefore, KE_mu = [ (M - m1 )² / (2 M ) ] c²\n\nWait, let me check with numbers. Given M = 139.6 MeV/c², m1 = 105.7 MeV/c².\n\nSo KE_mu = [ (139.6 - 105.7 )² / (2 * 139.6 ) ] MeV\n\nCompute numerator: (33.9)^2 = 1149.21 MeV²\n\nDenominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV\n\nSo KE_mu ≈ 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 11.4921 / 2.792 ≈ approx 4.116 MeV. Which is approximately 4.12 MeV. That matches our previous result. So the kinetic energy of the muon is ~4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu = M c² - E1 = M c² - [ (M² + m1² ) / (2 M ) ] c² = [ 2 M² - M² - m1² ] / (2 M ) c² = [ M² - m1² ] / (2 M ) c² = same as x * c², which we found earlier as 29.78 MeV.\n\nSo this formula gives us the kinetic energy of the muon directly. Therefore, the answer is B: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
