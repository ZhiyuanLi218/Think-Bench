I need to figure out which of the options A to D are correct based on the problem given. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nSo, there's an object of mass m on a horizontal table. It's being pulled by a constant horizontal force F, starting from rest. When it has traveled a distance s₀, its speed is v₀. At that moment, the force F is removed, and then the object slides an additional 2s₀ before stopping. We need to find which statements about work, impulse, coefficient of friction, and the magnitude of F are correct.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. The object starts from rest, so initial velocity is zero. A force F is applied horizontally. There must be friction because after removing F, the object slides to a stop. The total distance traveled is s₀ + 2s₀ = 3s₀, but the problem splits it into two parts: first s₀ with force F, then 2s₀ without.\n\nLet me recall some physics concepts here. Work done by forces relates to kinetic energy. Impulse is related to change in momentum. Also, friction will do work against the motion, so we need to consider the work done by friction in both parts of the motion.\n\nLet me start by considering the entire motion. The object starts from rest and ends at rest. So the total work done on the object over the entire distance should be zero because the change in kinetic energy is zero (from 0 to 0). But there are different forces doing work: the applied force F during the first part, and friction during both parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can split it into two parts: the first part where F is applied, and the second part where it's just sliding with friction.\n\nLet me denote the coefficient of kinetic friction as μ. Then the frictional force is μmg, since it's on a horizontal table and the normal force is mg.\n\nIn the first part, the object is pulled by F, and there's friction opposing it. So the net force during the first part is F - f_friction = F - μmg. This net force causes acceleration, so the object goes from rest to velocity v₀ over distance s₀.\n\nIn the second part, after F is removed, the only horizontal force is friction, which is -μmg (opposing motion). The object decelerates and comes to rest after sliding 2s₀.\n\nSo maybe I can use the work-energy theorem for each part.\n\nFirst, for the first part (distance s₀):\n\nThe work done by F is F*s₀. The work done by friction is -μmg*s₀ (negative because friction opposes motion). The net work done is (F - μmg)s₀, which equals the change in kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv₀² - 0 = (1/2)mv₀².\n\nSo equation 1: F*s₀ - μmg*s₀ = (1/2)mv₀². (1)\n\nFor the second part (distance 2s₀):\n\nAfter F is removed, the only work done is by friction. So work done by friction is -μmg*(2s₀). The change in kinetic energy here is 0 - (1/2)mv₀² = - (1/2)mv₀².\n\nSo equation 2: -μmg*(2s₀) = - (1/2)mv₀². (2)\n\nLet me solve equation (2) first. Let me rearrange equation (2):\n\n-μmg*(2s₀) = - (1/2)mv₀²\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nμmg*(2s₀) = (1/2)mv₀²\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\nμg*(2s₀) = (1/2)v₀²\n\nThen:\n\nμ = (1/2 * v₀²) / (2s₀ g) ) = v₀² / (4 s₀ g)\n\nWait, that gives μ = v₀²/(4 s₀ g). Which is option C. So option C is correct? Let me check the options again.\n\nOption C says the coefficient of kinetic friction is v₀²/(4 s₀ g). Yes, that's exactly what I just found. So option C is correct. So that's one correct answer.\n\nNow let's go back to equation (1):\n\nF*s₀ - μmg*s₀ = (1/2)mv₀²\n\nBut from equation (2), we found that μmg*(2s₀) = (1/2)mv₀². Let me note that (1/2)mv₀² = μmg*(2s₀). Therefore, substituting into equation (1):\n\nF*s₀ - μmg*s₀ = μmg*2s₀\n\nTherefore:\n\nF*s₀ = μmg*2s₀ + μmg*s₀ = μmg*3s₀\n\nDivide both sides by s₀:\n\nF = 3 μ m g\n\nBut from equation (2), we found that μ = v₀²/(4 s₀ g). Let me plug that into F:\n\nF = 3 * [v₀²/(4 s₀ g)] * m g = 3 m v₀²/(4 s₀)\n\nSo F is 3mv₀²/(4s₀). Let me note that.\n\nNow let's check the options.\n\nOption A: The work done by F during this process is (1/2)mv₀².\n\nThe work done by F is only during the first part, which is F*s₀. From above, F*s₀ is equal to 3 μ m g s₀. Wait, but earlier, from equation (1), we had F*s₀ - μ m g s₀ = (1/2)mv₀². Therefore, work done by F is (1/2)mv₀² + μ m g s₀. But from equation (2), μ m g * 2 s₀ = (1/2)mv₀². Therefore, μ m g s₀ = (1/4)mv₀². Therefore, work done by F is (1/2)mv₀² + (1/4)mv₀² = (3/4)mv₀². Therefore, the work done by F is 3/4 mv₀². But option A says it is 1/2 mv₀². Therefore, option A is incorrect. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B: The impulse of F during this process is equal to (3/2)mv₀.\n\nImpulse is force multiplied by time. But we need to find the time during which F is applied. Alternatively, since impulse equals change in momentum, but during the time F is applied, the change in momentum is from 0 to mv₀ (since after F is removed, the object still has velocity v₀, and then it slows down to stop). Wait, but the total impulse from all forces during the time F is applied would be equal to the change in momentum, which is mv₀ - 0 = mv₀. However, the impulse of F alone is F*t, and the impulse of friction is -f_friction*t. So total impulse is (F - f_friction)*t = mv₀. But the question is about the impulse of F during this process. So just F*t. To find that, we need to find the time t during which F is applied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find t using kinematics. Let me think.\n\nFirst, during the first part, the object accelerates from 0 to v₀ over distance s₀. Let me find the acceleration during this phase.\n\nFrom equation (1): net force is F - μmg = ma₁, so a₁ = (F - μmg)/m. But we already found F = 3 μ m g. Therefore:\n\na₁ = (3 μ m g - μ m g)/m = 2 μ g.\n\nAlternatively, we can use kinematics. The object starts from rest, accelerates to v₀ over distance s₀. Using the equation v² = u² + 2a s. Here, u=0, v = v₀, s = s₀. Therefore:\n\nv₀² = 2 a₁ s₀ => a₁ = v₀²/(2s₀).\n\nBut earlier, we found a₁ = 2 μ g. Therefore, equate:\n\nv₀²/(2s₀) = 2 μ g => μ = v₀²/(4 s₀ g), which matches what we found earlier. Good.\n\nSo acceleration during first part is a₁ = v₀²/(2s₀). Also, since a₁ = 2 μ g.\n\nNow, to find the time t during which F is applied. Using v = u + a t. Here, v₀ = 0 + a₁ t => t = v₀ / a₁ = v₀ / [v₀²/(2s₀)] = 2s₀ / v₀.\n\nTherefore, the time during which F is applied is t = 2s₀ / v₀.\n\nThen, impulse from F is F * t. Let me compute that. Earlier, we found F = 3 μ m g. And μ = v₀²/(4 s₀ g). Therefore:\n\nF = 3 * [v₀²/(4 s₀ g)] * m g = 3 m v₀²/(4 s₀). Then impulse is F * t = [3 m v₀²/(4 s₀)] * [2 s₀ / v₀] = 3 m v₀²/(4 s₀) * 2 s₀ / v₀ = 3 m v₀ * 2 / 4 = (6/4) m v₀ = (3/2) m v₀. Therefore, impulse of F is indeed (3/2)mv₀. Therefore, option B is correct. So B is correct.\n\nOption D: The magnitude of F is twice the magnitude of the sliding frictional force on the object.\n\nThe sliding frictional force is f_friction = μ m g. From earlier, we found F = 3 μ m g. Therefore, F is 3 times the frictional force, not twice. Therefore, option D is incorrect. So D is wrong.\n\nSo options B and C are correct. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"we should choose\" which options are correct. Let me check again:\n\nOptions:\n\n(A) The work done by F during this process is ½mv₀². We found that the work done by F is 3/4 mv₀², so A is wrong.\n\n(B) The impulse of F during this process is equal to 3/2 mv₀. Yes, we calculated that. So B is correct.\n\n(C) The coefficient of kinetic friction is v₀²/(4s₀g). Yes, correct.\n\n(D) The magnitude of F is twice the sliding friction. We found F is 3 times friction. So D is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and C.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled (A) to (D), and the user probably expects multiple correct answers? But in some cases, maybe the options are single choice? Wait, the original question says \"we should choose\" but doesn't specify how many. Let me check the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem says \"Options: (A)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So maybe multiple can be correct? In Chinese tests sometimes multiple options can be correct. However, the way the question is presented here, the user might expect me to pick all correct ones. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial problem statement didn't specify whether it's multiple choice or single choice. But given that in the original Chinese context, sometimes multiple options can be correct. However, let me check again my calculations.\n\nFor option C: coefficient μ = v₀²/(4s₀g). Yes, correct.\n\nFor option B: impulse of F is 3/2 mv₀. Yes, correct.\n\nSo if the options are multiple correct, then B and C. However, looking back at the options given:\n\n(A) Work done by F is ½mv₀² → incorrect.\n\n(B) Impulse of F is 3/2 mv₀ → correct.\n\n(C) μ is v₀²/(4s₀g) → correct.\n\n(D) F is twice friction → incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C. However, looking at the original problem's options, in Chinese entrance exams, sometimes options are labeled with letters and you have to choose all correct ones. But depending on the original problem's intention, maybe there's more?\n\nWait, let me check option D again. The magnitude of F is twice the sliding frictional force. Earlier, we found that F = 3 μ m g, while the frictional force is μ m g. Therefore, F is 3 times friction, so D is incorrect. So no.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B and C. However, looking back at the problem statement, the user lists the options as (A) to (D), and says \"we should choose\". Depending on the original source, maybe in the original problem only one is correct? Wait, but according to my analysis, both B and C are correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me check option C again. From equation (2):\n\nμ = v₀²/(4 s₀ g). Yes. So C is correct.\n\nOption B: impulse of F is 3/2 mv₀. Yes, as calculated.\n\nSo if the options are multiple correct, then B and C. But maybe in the original problem's context, the options are single choice? But the problem didn't specify. However, since in physics problems like this, multiple options can be correct, and the user hasn't indicated otherwise, I think B and C are correct.\n\nBut let me check again for any miscalculations. Let me recheck impulse calculation.\n\nImpulse from F is F*t. We found F = 3 μ m g. And t = 2s₀ / v₀. Also, from earlier, from equation (2), we had μ m g * 2 s₀ = ½ m v₀² ⇒ μ g = v₀²/(4 s₀). Therefore, F = 3 μ m g = 3*(v₀²/(4 s₀ g)) * m g = 3 m v₀²/(4 s₀). Then impulse is F*t = [3 m v₀²/(4 s₀)] * [2 s₀ / v₀] = 3 m v₀²/(4 s₀) * 2 s₀ / v₀ = 3 m v₀ * 2 / 4 = 3/2 m v₀. Correct. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C. However, looking at the options given, the user might expect the answer to be multiple, but in the initial problem statement, sometimes options are given as multiple select. However, since the user hasn't specified, but in the Chinese context, sometimes multiple options can be correct, but presented as separate letters. So the answer would be B and C.\n\nBut let me check again if there's any other possible mistake. For example, option D says F is twice the sliding friction. Since F is 3 times, D is wrong. Option A says work done by F is ½mv₀², but we found it's 3/4 mv₀². So A is wrong. So yes, only B and C are correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. For example, total work done by all forces over entire motion is zero, since starts and ends at rest. Total work is work by F plus work by friction over entire distance. Work by F is F*s₀, work by friction is -μmg*(s₀ + 2s₀) = -3 μ m g s₀. Therefore:\n\nF*s₀ - 3 μ m g s₀ = 0 ⇒ F = 3 μ m g. Which is consistent with what we found earlier. And from equation (2), μ = v₀²/(4 s₀ g). Therefore, F = 3 * [v₀²/(4 s₀ g)] * m g = 3 m v₀²/(4 s₀). So work done by F is F*s₀ = 3 m v₀²/(4 s₀) * s₀ = 3/4 m v₀². So option A says ½ m v₀², which is less than the actual work done by F. Therefore, A is wrong. So yes, only B and C are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be options B and C. However, looking back at the original problem's options, if the user expects multiple answers, then they should be selected. However, in some cases, maybe there is a trick? For example, maybe the question is from a specific exam where only one answer is correct? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with the impulse. The impulse of F is 3/2 mv₀, but what is the total impulse from all forces during the application of F? That would be mv₀ (since the object goes from 0 to v₀). But the impulse from F is 3/2 mv₀, and the impulse from friction during that time is -F_friction * t = -μ m g * t. Let's check if (F*t - μ m g * t) equals mv₀.\n\nFrom above, F*t = 3/2 mv₀, and μ m g * t is?\n\nWe have μ m g * t. From earlier, μ = v₀²/(4 s₀ g), t = 2s₀ / v₀. Therefore:\n\nμ m g * t = [v₀²/(4 s₀ g)] * m g * [2 s₀ / v₀] = [v₀² * m * 2 s₀ ] / [4 s₀ v₀] ] = [2 m v₀ ] / 4 = m v₀ / 2. Therefore, impulse from friction is -mv₀/2. Then total impulse is F*t + friction impulse = 3/2 mv₀ - 1/2 mv₀ = mv₀, which matches the change in momentum. Correct. Therefore, the impulse from F is indeed 3/2 mv₀. So B is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my analysis is correct. So the correct options are B and C. However, looking at the options given, the user might need to select multiple. But since the user hasn't specified, but in the initial problem statement, maybe in the original source, the answer is multiple. However, in the Chinese Gaokao or similar exams, sometimes multiple choices are allowed. Therefore, the answer should be options B and C.\n\nBut let me check if the original problem is from a specific source. Since I don't have that context, I have to rely on my calculations. Therefore, I conclude that options B and C are correct.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, the user lists them as (A) to (D), and the answer should be \"From A to D, we should choose...\" which probably expects multiple letters. However, in the initial problem statement, maybe there's a translation issue. In Chinese physics problems, sometimes multiple options can be correct, and you have to select all that apply. Therefore, if the options are B and C, then the answer is B and C. However, looking at the original problem again, maybe the answer expects only one? Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the coefficient of friction. Let me recalculate μ. From equation (2):\n\n-μ m g * 2s₀ = -½ m v₀² ⇒ μ = v₀²/(4 s₀ g). Yes, correct. So option C is correct.\n\nTherefore, yes, options B and C are correct. Therefore, the answer should be B and C. But depending on the original problem's options, maybe there's a different answer. However, based on my calculations, B and C are correct.\n\nBut let me check the original problem's options again:\n\n(A) Work done by F is ½mv₀² → incorrect.\n\n(B) Impulse of F is 3/2 mv₀ → correct.\n\n(C) μ is v₀²/(4s₀g) → correct.\n\n(D) F is twice friction → incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B and C. If the options are multiple select, then B and C. However, if the user expects the answer in a specific format, like boxed letters, maybe \\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C}, but since the instructions say \"we should choose\" from A to D, and in Chinese exams sometimes multiple are correct, but depending on the platform's requirements, maybe the correct answer is BC. However, since the user hasn't specified whether multiple answers are allowed, but given that in physics problems like this, multiple can be correct, I think it's safe to go with B and C.\n\nBut let me check once more for any possible error. For example, maybe the work done by F is considered over the entire process? But no, the work done by F is only during the first part, when the force is applied. The second part, F is removed. So work done by F is only F*s₀, which we found to be 3/4 mv₀². So A is wrong. B and C are correct. D is wrong. Therefore, the answer is B and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C}\n\nBut since in some contexts multiple answers need to be in one box, maybe \\boxed{BC}?\n\nHowever, depending on the platform's requirements. Since the original instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and typically for multiple choice with multiple correct answers in Chinese exams, they might expect multiple boxes or a combined box. Given that here it's an AI response, and the standard practice in many cases is to have multiple boxed answers if allowed, but if the system requires a single box, maybe \\boxed{BC}.\n\nBut looking at the initial problem statement, if it's from an official exam, for example, in China's Gaokao, sometimes multiple choices are labeled with options like ABCD, and you have to select all correct ones. However, since the user hasn't specified, but given the way the question is presented here, and the fact that in many online platforms, multiple boxed answers are acceptable, I will go with \\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C}. However, if forced to have a single box, \\boxed{BC} might be appropriate. But I need to check if the original options are single-select or multi-select. Since the problem didn't specify, but given that both B and C are correct, I'll present them as separate boxed answers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C}\n\nBut since the system might expect a single boxed answer, maybe the correct options are B and C, and in the original problem's context, maybe the answer is BC. However, looking at the initial problem's options, if it's from a source where multiple answers are possible, but in the absence of specific instructions, I think the correct approach is to list both. However, looking at the problem again, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis?\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's compute the work done by F. From the first part, we have:\n\nWork done by F is F*s₀. From equation (1): F*s₀ = (1/2)mv₀² + μ m g s₀. And from equation (2): μ m g * 2s₀ = ½mv₀² ⇒ μ m g s₀ = ¼mv₀². Therefore, work done by F is ½mv₀² + ¼mv₀² = ¾mv₀². So option A is ½mv₀², which is less than actual work done. So A is wrong. So B and C are correct.\n\nYes, so I think my conclusion is correct. Hence, the final answer is B and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B} and \\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
