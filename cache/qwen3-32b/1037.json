The question gives me the partial pressures of each gas and asks for the total pressure. Hmm, I remember something about partial pressures from my chemistry class. Let me think... Oh right! Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. I think that's what it's called. \n\nDalton's Law says that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas. So basically, if I add up all the partial pressures, I should get the total pressure. Let me check if that makes sense. Each gas contributes its own pressure independently, so adding them together should work. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlright, so the given partial pressures are 25 kPa for CO₂, 7.50 kPa for N₂, and 52.5 kPa for O₂. Let me write those down:\n\n- CO₂: 25 kPa\n- N₂: 7.50 kPa\n- O₂: 52.5 kPa\n\nNow, I just need to add them all up. Let me do that step by step. First, add the CO₂ and N₂: 25 kPa + 7.50 kPa. Let me calculate that. 25 plus 7.5 is 32.5 kPa. Then add the O₂ pressure to that. 32.5 kPa + 52.5 kPa. Hmm, 32.5 plus 52.5... Well, 32 + 52 is 84, and 0.5 + 0.5 is 1.0, so total is 85 kPa. Wait, so the total pressure is 85 kPa?\n\nLet me verify that again to make sure I didn't add wrong. 25 plus 7.50 is indeed 32.5. Then 32.5 plus 52.5... Yeah, 32.5 + 52.5 equals 85.0 kPa. So the total pressure is 85 kPa. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, option B is 85 kPa. So that must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The question is straightforward—no mention of temperature changes, volume changes, or anything else that might affect pressure. It's just a simple application of Dalton's Law. \n\nWait, but why are there three different gases? Does the type of gas matter for Dalton's Law? I think not. Dalton's Law applies regardless of the type of gas because each gas behaves independently in terms of pressure. So whether they are CO₂, N₂, or O₂, their partial pressures just add up. So no issues there. \n\nAnother way to check is to recall that partial pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles of each gas if temperature and volume are constant, but since we're given the pressures already, adding them is the right approach. \n\nSo yeah, 25 + 7.5 + 52.5 equals 85. The answer must be B. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I think that's solid.\n</think>"}
