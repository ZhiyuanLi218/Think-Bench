I need to figure out how high the cliff is when a rock is dropped and hits the ground at 30 m/s. Hmm. Alright, so the rock is just dropped, right? So that means its initial velocity is zero. And it's under the influence of gravity, so it's accelerating downward. The question is asking for the height of the cliff, which is essentially the distance the rock falls.\n\nI remember there are some kinematic equations for motion under constant acceleration. Since gravity is acting on the rock, the acceleration should be 9.8 m/s² downward. Let me recall the equations. There's one that relates velocity, acceleration, and distance. Maybe v² = u² + 2as? Yeah, that sounds right. Where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the displacement.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The initial velocity u is 0 because the rock is dropped, not thrown. The final velocity v is 30 m/s. The acceleration a is 9.8 m/s². And s is the height of the cliff, which we need to find.\n\nSo substituting into the equation: (30)^2 = (0)^2 + 2 * 9.8 * s. Let me compute that. 30 squared is 900. So 900 = 0 + 19.6 * s. Therefore, s = 900 / 19.6. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 900 divided by 19.6. Let me do the division step by step.\n\nFirst, 19.6 times 45 is... Let me check. 19.6 * 45. Well, 20 * 45 is 900, so 19.6 is 0.4 less than 20. So 0.4 * 45 = 18. Therefore, 19.6 * 45 = 900 - 18 = 882. So 19.6 * 45 = 882. But we have 900. So 900 - 882 = 18. So 18 / 19.6 more than 45. So total s is 45 + (18 / 19.6). Let me compute 18 divided by 19.6. That's approximately 0.918. So total s ≈ 45 + 0.918 ≈ 45.918 meters. Wait, but the answer choices don't have 45.9. The options are 20, 30, 45, 60. So the closest is 45 m. But wait, my calculation gives approximately 45.9 m, which is close to 45 m. But why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I should check the calculation again. Let me do 900 divided by 19.6 more accurately. Let's see. 19.6 times 45 is 882, as before. So 900 divided by 19.6 equals 45 + (18 / 19.6). Let me compute 18 / 19.6. Multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate decimals: 180 / 196. Simplify that. Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 45 / 49. Which is approximately 0.918. So total is approximately 45.918 m. So approximately 45.9 meters. The answer choices are A:20, B:30, C:45, D:60. So the closest is C:45 m. But is there a rounding difference here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using g = 10 m/s² for simplicity? Let me check that. If we take g as 10 m/s², then the equation would be 30² = 2 * 10 * s => 900 = 20s => s = 45 m. Exactly 45 m. So that would make the answer C. So perhaps in the problem, they used g = 10 m/s² for simplification. That would explain why 45 is the answer. So the answer is C:45 m.\n\nBut wait, why did I get approximately 45.9 when using 9.8? Because if they used 9.8, the answer is about 45.9, but since 45 is an option, and the others are 20, 30, 60, which are further away, maybe they just want us to use g=10. That's a common practice in physics problems to simplify calculations. So the answer is C:45 m.\n\nLet me verify once again. If I use g=9.8, then s = 900 / 19.6 ≈ 45.918 m. If the answer options are in whole numbers, and 45 is one of them, then maybe the question expects an approximate answer. However, if they used g=10, then it's exactly 45. So perhaps the question assumes g=10 m/s². Either way, 45 is the closest answer. So the answer is C.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The formula is v² = 2gh, solving for h = v²/(2g). So h = (30)^2 / (2*9.8) ≈ 900 / 19.6 ≈ 45.9 m. Since 45 is an option, and the others are not close, the answer must be C. So I think the correct answer is C:45 m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
