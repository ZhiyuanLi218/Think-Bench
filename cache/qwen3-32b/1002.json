This acceleration affects only the **vertical component** of velocity.\n\n2. **Velocity**:\n   - The **horizontal component** of velocity remains constant throughout the flight.\n   - The **vertical component** of velocity decreases on the way up (until it reaches 0 at the top) and then increases in the downward direction (in magnitude).\n\n3. **Speed**: The **total speed** is the magnitude of the velocity vector and is given by:\n   $$\n   v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}\n   $$\n   Since $ v_y $ changes, the total speed is **not constant** during the flight.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Each Option:\n\n- **Option A**: *“The acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.”*  \n  This is **false**. The **acceleration vector is always downward**, regardless of the direction of the velocity vector. While it may be opposite to the vertical component of velocity on the way up, it is not necessarily opposite to the **entire velocity vector**, which also includes a horizontal component.\n\n- **Option B**: *“The speed at the top of the trajectory is zero.”*  \n  This is **false**. At the top, the **vertical component of velocity is zero**, but the **horizontal component remains constant**. Hence, the **total speed is not zero**.\n\n- **Option C**: *“The object's total speed remains constant during the entire flight.”*  \n  This is **false**. As noted earlier, the **vertical component of velocity** changes due to gravity, so the total speed (magnitude of the velocity vector) also changes.\n\n- **Option D**: *“The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.”*  \n  This is **true**. The **vertical component of velocity** decreases as the projectile rises (due to gravity), reaches zero at the top, and then increases in magnitude as the projectile falls back down. If we interpret \"vertical speed\" as the **magnitude of vertical velocity**, it indeed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{D}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out which of the statements A to D is true about an ideal projectile launched at 45 degrees. Hmm, projectile motion. I remember that in projectile motion, assuming no air resistance, the only acceleration is due to gravity, which acts downward. So the acceleration is always straight down, right?\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"The acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.\" Wait, acceleration is always downward. The velocity vector on the way up has an upward component, but the acceleration is still downward. So the acceleration vector is opposite to the vertical component of velocity on the way up, but not necessarily the entire velocity vector. Since the projectile is moving at an angle, the velocity vector is diagonal upwards. The acceleration is straight down. So the acceleration vector isn't opposite to the entire velocity vector, just the vertical component. So maybe A is not correct. Because the acceleration is always downward, regardless of whether it's going up or down. So when the projectile is going up, the acceleration is opposite to the velocity's vertical component, but the velocity vector as a whole is still at an angle. Similarly, when going down, the velocity vector is downward and horizontal. The acceleration is still downward. So the acceleration vector is in the same direction as the velocity vector only when the projectile is going straight down, but not during the descent. Wait, but the velocity vector on the way down is partly horizontal and partly vertical. So the acceleration vector is downward, but the velocity vector is at an angle downward. So the acceleration isn't in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down. Therefore, statement A is false. So A is not correct.\n\nOption B: \"The speed at the top of the trajectory is zero.\" Hmm, at the top of the trajectory, the vertical component of velocity is zero, but the horizontal component is still there. Since there's no air resistance, horizontal velocity remains constant. So the speed at the top is equal to the horizontal component of velocity, which is not zero. Therefore, B is false.\n\nOption C: \"The object's total speed remains constant during the entire flight.\" Well, speed is the magnitude of velocity. Since the vertical component of velocity is changing (slowing down on the way up, speeding up on the way down), while the horizontal component is constant. So the total speed is sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2). Since vy is changing, the total speed isn't constant. So C is false.\n\nOption D: \"The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.\" Let's think. Vertical speed is the vertical component of velocity. On the way up, the vertical velocity decreases because gravity is acting against it. At the top, it's zero. Then on the way down, the vertical velocity increases in the downward direction. So if we consider vertical speed as the magnitude, then maybe it's increasing? Wait, but if vertical speed is the actual velocity (which can be negative), then on the way up, it's decreasing from positive to zero, and on the way down, it's increasing in the negative direction. But the question says \"vertical speed\". If they mean the magnitude, then it decreases to zero and then increases again. But if they mean velocity, then it's decreasing (becoming more negative). However, the term \"speed\" usually refers to magnitude. Wait, but the wording is \"vertical speed\". Hmm. Wait, in common language, speed is scalar, but sometimes people use \"speed\" to refer to velocity components. But in physics, speed is scalar, velocity is vector. So vertical speed would be the magnitude of the vertical velocity. So on the way up, vertical speed decreases from initial value to zero. On the way down, vertical speed increases from zero to some maximum. So the vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down. Therefore, statement D is true. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nLet me check again. For projectile motion, vertical velocity is affected by gravity. So if you launch at 45 degrees, initial vertical velocity is v0*sin(45). As it goes up, vertical velocity decreases by 9.8 m/s each second until it reaches zero. Then on the way down, it increases by 9.8 m/s each second. So if vertical speed is the magnitude of vertical velocity, then yes, it decreases on the way up and increases on the way down. So D is correct. The other options are incorrect. So the answer is D.\n</think>"}
