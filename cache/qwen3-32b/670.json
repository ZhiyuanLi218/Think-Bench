Such a state has no coherence and lies at the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{A: \\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the geometric position of the given density matrix in the qubit space, which I think refers to the Bloch sphere. The density matrix is given as ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are different points in 3D space, like (0,0,0) and others. Let me recall how density matrices relate to the Bloch sphere.\n\nFirst, I remember that any qubit state can be represented on the Bloch sphere using a vector r = (x, y, z), and the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz), and I is the identity matrix.\n\nSo, if I can write the given ρ in that form, I can identify the components of r. Let me start by expanding the given density matrix.\n\nThe given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write out |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| as matrices. \n\n|0⟩ is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]. Adding these together gives [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which is the identity matrix. Therefore, ρ = (I)/2, since (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) is the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2.\n\nNow, comparing this with the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If ρ is I/2, then (I + r·σ)/2 must equal I/2. Therefore, I + r·σ must equal I. Subtracting I from both sides gives r·σ = 0. \n\nSince σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, r·σ = r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. For this to be the zero matrix, each component must be zero. So r_x, r_y, and r_z must all be zero. Therefore, the vector r is (0, 0, 0). \n\nLooking at the options, option A is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The density matrix ρ = I/2 is the completely mixed state, right? And the completely mixed state on the Bloch sphere is at the origin, because pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside, with the completely mixed state at the center. So yes, that would be (0,0,0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of the Bloch vector components. Let me recall that for a general state ρ, the components of r are given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Specifically:\n\nr_x = Tr(ρ σx)\nr_y = Tr(ρ σy)\nr_z = Tr(ρ σz)\n\nSo let's compute these for our ρ. Since ρ is I/2, let's compute Tr( (I/2) σx ). The trace of σx is zero because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], trace is 0+0=0. Similarly for σy and σz. Therefore, all components r_x, r_y, r_z are zero. Hence, r=(0,0,0), which is option A.\n\nBut let me check if there's any chance I made a mistake in calculating ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. But |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is indeed the identity matrix. So ρ is I/2. Therefore, the conclusion is correct. So the answer is A. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if you have a qubit in a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities (1/2 each), that's the maximally mixed state. Which has no preferred direction on the Bloch sphere, hence the Bloch vector is zero. So yes, the origin. So A is correct.\n\nI don't see any errors in this reasoning. The other options don't make sense. For example, (0,0,1) would be the state |0⟩, but here we have a mixed state. (1,1,0) would be some direction in the x-y plane, but our state is completely mixed. So definitely A is the answer.\n</think>"}
