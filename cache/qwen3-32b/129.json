The problem gives me the kinetic energy T and potential energy V in terms of generalized coordinates q₁, q₂, q₃ and their time derivatives. The initial conditions are given, but maybe I need them later? Let me start by recalling how to derive equations of motion from kinetic and potential energy.\n\nI think Lagrangian mechanics is the way to go here. The Lagrangian L is T - V, right? And then the Euler-Lagrange equations for each coordinate q_i are:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂q̇_i) - ∂L/∂q_i = 0.\n\nSo I need to compute the Lagrangian first. Let me write that down.\n\nGiven T is (1/2)(q̇₁² + q̇₂² + q̇₃²). And V is 2q₁² + (5/2)q₂² + 2q₃² - q₁q₂ - q₂q₃. Therefore, the Lagrangian L = T - V is:\n\nL = (1/2)(q̇₁² + q̇₂² + q̇₃²) - [2q₁² + (5/2)q₂² + 2q₃² - q₁q₂ - q₂q₃].\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL = (1/2)(q̇₁² + q̇₂² + q̇₃²) - 2q₁² - (5/2)q₂² - 2q₃² + q₁q₂ + q₂q₃.\n\nNow, I need to apply the Euler-Lagrange equation for each of the three coordinates. Let me start with q₁.\n\nFor q₁:\n\nFirst, compute ∂L/∂q₁. Looking at L, the terms involving q₁ are -2q₁² + q₁q₂. So derivative with respect to q₁ is -4q₁ + q₂.\n\nThen compute ∂L/∂q̇₁. The terms in L involving q̇₁ is (1/2)q̇₁², so derivative is q̇₁. Then d/dt of that is q̈₁.\n\nSo putting into Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂q̇₁) - ∂L/∂q₁ = q̈₁ - (-4q₁ + q₂) = q̈₁ + 4q₁ - q₂ = 0.\n\nTherefore, equation for q₁ is:\n\nq̈₁ + 4q₁ - q₂ = 0 ⇒ q̈₁ = -4q₁ + q₂.\n\nOkay, moving on to q₂.\n\nCompute ∂L/∂q₂. Terms in L involving q₂ are -(5/2)q₂² + q₁q₂ + q₂q₃. So derivative is -5q₂ + q₁ + q₃.\n\n∂L/∂q̇₂ is (1/2)*2q̇₂ = q̇₂? Wait, no. The kinetic energy term is (1/2)q̇₂², so derivative with respect to q̇₂ is q̇₂. Then d/dt of that is q̈₂.\n\nTherefore, Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\nq̈₂ - (-5q₂ + q₁ + q₃) = q̈₂ + 5q₂ - q₁ - q₃ = 0 ⇒ q̈₂ = -5q₂ + q₁ + q₃.\n\nNow for q₃.\n\n∂L/∂q₃: Terms involving q₃ are -2q₃² + q₂q₃. So derivative is -4q₃ + q₂.\n\n∂L/∂q̇₃ is q̇₃, derivative is q̇₃, time derivative is q̈₃.\n\nThus Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\nq̈₃ - (-4q₃ + q₂) = q̈₃ + 4q₃ - q₂ = 0 ⇒ q̈₃ = -4q₃ + q₂.\n\nSo putting all together, the equations of motion are:\n\n1. q̈₁ = -4q₁ + q₂\n\n2. q̈₂ = -5q₂ + q₁ + q₃\n\n3. q̈₃ = -4q₃ + q₂\n\nWait, let me check if I did the derivatives correctly. For the potential energy, V is given as 2q₁² + 5/2 q₂² + 2q₃² - q₁q₂ - q₂q₃. Therefore, when taking the derivative of V with respect to q, the coefficients would be:\n\nFor q₁: dV/dq₁ = 4q₁ - q₂.\n\nSimilarly, for q₂: dV/dq₂ = 5q₂ - q₁ - q₃.\n\nFor q₃: dV/dq₃ = 4q₃ - q₂.\n\nBut since L = T - V, then ∂L/∂q_i = - ∂V/∂q_i. Therefore, in the Euler-Lagrange equations, we have:\n\nd/dt(∂T/∂q̇_i) + ∂V/∂q_i = 0. Wait, because ∂L/∂q_i = ∂T/∂q_i - ∂V/∂q_i. But since T does not depend on q_i (only on q̇_i), ∂T/∂q_i is zero. Therefore ∂L/∂q_i = -∂V/∂q_i. Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation is:\n\nd/dt(∂T/∂q̇_i) + ∂V/∂q_i = 0.\n\nBut ∂T/∂q̇_i is the canonical momentum, which for each coordinate here is just q̇_i, since T is (1/2)(q̇₁² + ...). Therefore, d/dt(∂T/∂q̇_i) is q̈_i. Therefore, equations are:\n\nq̈_i + ∂V/∂q_i = 0. Which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the equations I derived above are correct. Let me check again:\n\nFor q₁: ∂V/∂q₁ = 4q₁ - q₂ ⇒ q̈₁ + 4q₁ - q₂ = 0 ⇒ q̈₁ = -4q₁ + q₂. Correct.\n\nFor q₂: ∂V/∂q₂ = 5q₂ - q₁ - q₃ ⇒ q̈₂ + 5q₂ - q₁ - q₃ = 0 ⇒ q̈₂ = -5q₂ + q₁ + q₃. Correct.\n\nFor q₃: ∂V/∂q₃ = 4q₃ - q₂ ⇒ q̈₃ + 4q₃ - q₂ = 0 ⇒ q̈₃ = -4q₃ + q₂. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the equations of motion are three second-order ODEs as above. But the problem says \"determine the equations of motion for the system.\" So maybe present them in a boxed format? Or maybe write them in matrix form? Or perhaps as a system of first-order equations? The question doesn't specify, but since they are second-order ODEs, maybe just present them as three equations.\n\nAlternatively, since they are linear, maybe write them in matrix form. Let me think.\n\nBut the question says \"equations of motion\", which is usually the second-order ODEs. So the answer is the three equations:\n\nq̈₁ = -4q₁ + q₂,\n\nq̈₂ = q₁ -5q₂ + q₃,\n\nq̈₃ = q₂ -4q₃.\n\nAlternatively, written with all terms on the left:\n\nq̈₁ + 4q₁ - q₂ = 0,\n\nq̈₂ + 5q₂ - q₁ - q₃ = 0,\n\nq̈₃ + 4q₃ - q₂ = 0.\n\nEither way is acceptable. Let me check if I can write them in matrix form. Since they are coupled linear equations, perhaps expressing them as a matrix equation. Let me try.\n\nLet me denote the vector q = [q₁, q₂, q₃]^T. Then, the equations can be written as:\n\n[ q̈₁ ]   [ -4  1   0 ] [ q₁ ]\n[ q̈₂ ] = [  1 -5   1 ] [ q₂ ]\n[ q̈₃ ]   [  0  1  -4 ] [ q₃ ]\n\nBut actually, it's:\n\nq̈₁ = -4q₁ + q₂,\n\nq̈₂ = q₁ -5q₂ + q₃,\n\nq̈₃ = q₂ -4q₃.\n\nYes, so the matrix would be as above. But unless the question asks for matrix form, maybe just present them as three equations. The problem says \"determine the equations of motion\", so probably the three second-order differential equations.\n\nAlternatively, if they want first-order equations, you can write them as six first-order equations by introducing velocities. But since they didn't specify, and the original Lagrangian is in terms of q and q̇, probably the standard approach is to present the second-order equations.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the equations of motion are:\n\n1. ÿ₁ + 4y₁ - y₂ = 0 (if we consider y_i = q_i)\n\nBut using the standard notation with double dots for acceleration:\n\nFor each coordinate:\n\nq̈₁ + 4q₁ - q₂ = 0,\n\nq̈₂ + 5q₂ - q₁ - q₃ = 0,\n\nq̈₃ + 4q₃ - q₂ = 0.\n\nAlternatively, solving for the accelerations:\n\nq̈₁ = -4q₁ + q₂,\n\nq̈₂ = -5q₂ + q₁ + q₃,\n\nq̈₃ = -4q₃ + q₂.\n\nYes, that's correct. Let me check once again for possible errors. Let me recompute ∂V/∂q₂.\n\nV = 2q₁² + (5/2)q₂² + 2q₃² - q₁q₂ - q₂q₃.\n\nSo derivative with respect to q₂ is:\n\ndV/dq₂ = 0 + (5/2)*2 q₂ + 0 - q₁ - q₃ = 5q₂ - q₁ - q₃. Correct. Then since the Euler-Lagrange equation is q̈_i + dV/dq_i = 0, so q̈₂ + 5q₂ - q₁ - q₃ = 0 ⇒ q̈₂ = -5q₂ + q₁ + q₃. Correct.\n\nSame for others. So I think these equations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the equations of motion are those three equations. The initial conditions are given but maybe they are just for context? The problem says \"determine the equations of motion\", which doesn't require using the initial conditions. The initial conditions might be relevant if they wanted specific solutions, but since they just want the equations, they are not needed here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the three equations as above. Let me write them boxed, perhaps each in a separate box? Or as a system.\n\nBut the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Since there are three equations, maybe present them in a system inside a box. But standard practice for multiple equations is to use a cases environment or something. However, since the user might expect each equation boxed or as a single box. Given that, maybe present them as three boxed equations? Or perhaps as a vector equation. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem says \"determine the equations of motion for the system.\" In physics, equations of motion are typically the differential equations, so three second-order ODEs. Since there are three, perhaps present each boxed. But the user might expect a single box with all three. Given the initial instructions, the assistant is supposed to put the final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nBut \\boxed{} usually is for a single equation. Maybe the user expects the three equations boxed individually? Or perhaps as a matrix equation? Alternatively, since it's a coupled system, maybe write them in a column.\n\nAlternatively, since the user might be expecting LaTeX code for the equations. Let me check the initial problem's formatting. The kinetic and potential energy are given in separate equations with $$...$$. So maybe present the three equations similarly.\n\nBut given the instruction says to put the final answer within \\boxed{}, which is typically for one line. Maybe the user is okay with multiple boxed equations? Or maybe write them as a system inside a single box. Since I can't have multiple boxes in one \\boxed, perhaps write them in a system inside a single box using LaTeX's cases environment.\n\nLet me try:\n\nThe equations of motion are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\ddot{q}_1 + 4q_1 - q_2 = 0 \\\\\n\\ddot{q}_2 + 5q_2 - q_1 - q_3 = 0 \\\\\n\\ddot{q}_3 + 4q_3 - q_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nBut since the user wants the final answer within \\boxed{}, maybe wrap this in a box. However, in LaTeX, boxing a cases environment is possible but might be too wide. Alternatively, since the user might accept multiple boxed equations. However, given the initial problem's energies are in separate equations, maybe just present the three equations boxed individually.\n\nBut the instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", which is a bit conflicting if there are multiple equations. Maybe the user expects each equation boxed? Or maybe the system as a whole? Since I can't be sure, but given that in many cases systems of equations are presented together, perhaps I can write them in a single box as a system.\n\nAlternatively, since the assistant's previous examples sometimes use multiple boxes for multiple equations, maybe do that. Let me check previous examples. However, since I can't actually browse previous examples, I need to make a judgment.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about equations of motion, which are three second-order ODEs, perhaps present them as such. Given that, I think the most appropriate is to write each equation boxed. Let me do that.\n\nSo:\n\nThe equations of motion are:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_1 + 4q_1 - q_2 = 0}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_2 + 5q_2 - q_1 - q_3 = 0}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_3 + 4q_3 - q_2 = 0}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants them in a different form, like solved for the accelerations:\n\nFor example,\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_1 = -4q_1 + q_2}\n$$\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_2 = -5q_2 + q_1 + q_3}\n$$\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_3 = -4q_3 + q_2}\n$$\n\nEither form is acceptable. The question doesn't specify, but since the Euler-Lagrange equations lead directly to the former (with all terms on the left), but both are correct. Given that, maybe present them in the standard form of differential equations, which is usually having the highest derivative on the left. So the second version. However, since both are correct, perhaps I can choose. Let me go with the latter, solving for the accelerations.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is the three equations as above, each boxed.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equations of motion for the system are:\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_1 = -4q_1 + q_2}\n$$\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_2 = -5q_2 + q_1 + q_3}\n$$\n$$\n\\boxed{\\ddot{q}_3 = -4q_3 + q_2}\n$$\n</think>"}
