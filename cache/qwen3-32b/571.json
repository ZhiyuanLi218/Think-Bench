The options are toluene, ethylene, ethanoic acid, and ethane. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these reacts most easily with chlorine. Let me start by recalling what I know about each of these compounds and their reactivity with chlorine gas.\n\nFirst, let's think about the types of reactions each might undergo with chlorine. Chlorine is a halogen, and it can participate in different types of reactions depending on the substrate. The main ones I remember are addition reactions and substitution reactions. \n\nStarting with ethylene (option B). Ethylene is an alkene, which has a double bond. Alkenes are known to undergo addition reactions with halogens like chlorine. The double bond can break, and each carbon in the double bond can add a chlorine atom. So, ethylene plus chlorine would form 1,2-dichloroethane. That's a pretty straightforward addition reaction. I think this is a common reaction, maybe even taught as an example of electrophilic addition. So ethylene is likely to react readily with chlorine gas.\n\nNow, ethane (option D) is an alkane. Alkanes typically undergo substitution reactions with halogens, but those usually require UV light or high temperatures to initiate a radical mechanism. Without such conditions, the reaction might not proceed easily. So ethane reacting with chlorine would need some activation energy. If the question is about which reacts \"most readily,\" maybe ethane isn't the best choice unless specific conditions are mentioned.\n\nToluene (option A) is an aromatic compound, a benzene ring with a methyl group. Aromatic compounds usually undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. Chlorination of aromatic rings typically requires a catalyst like FeCl3 and occurs under specific conditions. Chlorine gas alone might not be sufficient to chlorinate toluene without a catalyst. So maybe toluene doesn't react as readily with chlorine gas as ethylene does.\n\nEthanoic acid (option C) is a carboxylic acid. I'm not sure how it would react with chlorine gas. Carboxylic acids can undergo halogenation, but maybe under different conditions. For example, in the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, carboxylic acids are brominated at the alpha position using bromine and a catalyst. But with chlorine, perhaps a similar mechanism? However, this would require specific conditions. If just exposed to chlorine gas, would ethanoic acid react? I'm not certain. Maybe it's less reactive compared to ethylene.\n\nSo putting this together: ethylene (alkene) would readily add chlorine gas to form 1,2-dichloroethane. Ethane (alkane) would need UV light. Toluene (aromatic) needs a catalyst. Ethanoic acid might require specific conditions as well. Therefore, the answer is probably ethylene, option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For alkenes and halogens, the reaction is indeed an addition. The double bond is electron-rich, so it attacks the Cl2 molecule, leading to the addition. This is a fast reaction under normal conditions. For alkanes, substitution is slower and needs UV. Toluene's substitution would need a catalyst. Ethanoic acid... I think if you have a carboxylic acid, maybe the alpha hydrogen is acidic, so maybe in the presence of Cl2 and a catalyst, you could get alpha chlorination. But without a catalyst, maybe not. So under standard conditions, ethylene would react most readily. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
