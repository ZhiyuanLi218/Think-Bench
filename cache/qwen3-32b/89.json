I need to find the number of rotatable bonds in this molecule. The SMILES given is 'C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6'. Hmm, rotatable bonds are single bonds that are not in a ring and not adjacent to a double bond or something like that. Wait, the definition might be more precise. I remember that rotatable bonds are typically single bonds not in rings and not adjacent to a double bond. Or maybe also considering if they are in a ring but not part of a rigid structure like a benzene ring.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES to understand the structure. Let me try to break it down. The SMILES starts with C1=CC=C(C=C1), which is a benzene ring, right? The 1 is a ring closure. Then it's connected to C2=C(N=C3C=C...). Maybe there's a pyridine or similar ring here. This seems complex. Maybe I should try to draw the structure or at least count the bonds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to count the rotatable bonds without drawing the whole molecule. Rotatable bonds are usually single bonds that are not in a ring and are not adjacent to a double bond. So, each single bond that meets these criteria counts as a rotatable bond.\n\nLet me start by identifying all the single bonds in the molecule and then check which ones are in rings or adjacent to double bonds.\n\nBut first, let's parse the SMILES step by step. Let me write down the SMILES again:\n\nC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is C1=CC=C(C=C1), which is a benzene ring. The ring closure is between the first carbon and the last one. So that's a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds.\n\nThen connected to that is C2=C(N=C3C=C...). So maybe another ring here? Let's see. The C2=C... suggests another ring. Let me try to follow the numbering.\n\nThe SMILES continues as N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)... So the 3 is another ring closure. Let me see: N=C3C=C... so the ring is formed by connecting the N at position 3 to the C2. So maybe a five-membered ring here? Let me count. The ring closure is between the N at position 3 and the C2. So from the C2, which is connected to a double bond to N, then the N is connected to another C (C=C), then another C=C, then another C=C, and then closing the ring with NN3... Hmm, maybe it's a pyridine or similar structure. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the SMILES to count the number of rotatable bonds by looking for single bonds that are not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the benzene ring (C1=CC=C(C=C1)) has all double bonds and single bonds in a ring. So the single bonds in the benzene ring are part of the ring and are not rotatable. The double bonds are also not rotatable.\n\nNext, the part after the benzene ring is connected to C2=C... So that's another double bond. Then there's N=C3... which is another double bond. The ring closure here is between the N and the C2, forming a ring. So that's another ring. The bonds in this ring would not be rotatable if they are part of a ring. So any single bonds in this ring would be in a ring and thus not rotatable.\n\nThen there's a part with C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O. Let's see. The CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4 suggests another ring. The 4 and 5 are ring closures. So that's a benzene ring again? Because CC4=CC... maybe a substituted benzene? The part CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4 would form a ring. Let me parse this. Starting from CC4: C connected to another C (4), then =C to C5, then =C to C, then =C to C, then =C to C, then =C to C, then N4 closes the ring. So that's a six-membered ring? Let me count the atoms in the ring. The 4 is on the first C, then another C (5), then another C, another C, another C, another C, then back to N4. So that's six atoms in the ring? Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring. Let me see. The SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. Let me break it down:\n\n- CC4: Carbon connected to another Carbon (4)\n- =CC5: then a double bond to Carbon (5)\n- =CC=CC=C5: then a double bond to Carbon, then another double bond to Carbon, then another double bond to Carbon (5)\n- N4: then connected to N which closes the ring at 4.\n\nSo the ring is formed by the Carbon (4), then Carbon (5), then Carbon, Carbon, Carbon, and back to N4. That would be five atoms in the ring? Wait, Carbon (4) is connected to Carbon (5), which is connected to another Carbon, then another Carbon, then another Carbon, then back to N4. So that's Carbon (4)-Carbon (5)-Carbon-Carbon-Carbon-N4? Wait, that's five bonds? So a five-membered ring? Because Carbon (4) to N4 is one bond, and the other four atoms in between. So five-membered ring. So the bonds in this ring would be part of a ring and thus not rotatable.\n\nNow, moving on. The rest of the SMILES is C6=CC=CO6. That's another ring closure with O6. So C6=CC=CO6 would be a benzene ring? Because C6 starts the ring, then =C to C, =C to C, =C to O6. Wait, O6 is the ring closure. So that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen? But oxygen usually has a double bond in such rings. Wait, maybe it's a furan ring? But furan is five-membered. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse C6=CC=CO6. Starting from C6, then =C to C, =C to C, =C to O6. So the ring is C6 connected to O6 via a double bond? But that would be a three-membered ring? No, because C6 is connected to another C, which is connected to another C, which is connected to another C, which is connected to O6. Wait, the ring closure is O6. So the ring is C6-C-C-C-O6. That's four atoms? Wait, no. Let me count the bonds. The SMILES is C6=CC=CO6. So:\n\n- C6 is the starting point.\n- =C connects to another C (let's say C7).\n- =C connects to another C (C8).\n- =C connects to another C (C9).\n- Then O6 is the ring closure. Wait, that would be C6 connected to C7 (double bond), C7 to C8 (double bond), C8 to C9 (double bond), and C9 to O6 (double bond?), and then O6 back to C6? But that would form a five-membered ring with four double bonds? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo or I'm misparsing. Alternatively, maybe the O6 is a single bond? But in SMILES, unless specified, it's a single bond. Wait, the last part is C6=CC=CO6. The last bond is between the last C and O6, which is written as O6. So that's a single bond. So the ring is C6 connected to O6 via a single bond. But then the ring would be C6-C7-C8-C9-O6, which is five atoms connected in a ring. But the bonds between them are C=C, C=C, C=C, and then C-O. So maybe a five-membered ring with three double bonds and one single bond? That seems unlikely. Maybe it's a typo and should be C6=CC=C(O)C6, which would be a furan ring (five-membered with one oxygen and two double bonds). But the given SMILES is C6=CC=CO6. Hmm, maybe it's a six-membered ring? Let me see. If O6 is connected back to C6, then the ring would have C6, C7, C8, C9, and O6. That's five atoms. So a five-membered ring. So the bonds between C6-C7, C7-C8, C8-C9, C9-O6, and O6-C6. But the bonds are C=C, C=C, C=C, and C-O single bond. That's a five-membered ring with three double bonds and one single bond. That's not typical, but possible. Anyway, the point is that the bonds in this ring are part of a ring and thus not rotatable.\n\nNow, the main task is to count all the single bonds that are not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds. So, let's go through the SMILES and identify all the single bonds and check their context.\n\nFirst, the benzene ring (C1=CC=C(C=C1)) has all bonds as double bonds and single bonds in the ring. So none of these are rotatable.\n\nNext, the part after the benzene ring: C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6.\n\nLet me parse this step by step. The C2 is connected to the benzene ring. Then C2=C... which is a double bond to N. Then N=C3... another double bond. Then C=C... another double bond. Then NN3... which is a single bond? Wait, the part is C=C(NN3...). Let me look at the SMILES again: C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The C2 is connected to a double bond to N.\n- The N is connected to a double bond to C3.\n- The C3 is connected to a double bond to another C.\n- That C is connected to a single bond to NN3... Wait, the SMILES is C=C(NN3...). So the C=C is connected to a branch starting with N, then N (NN3...). Wait, maybe it's a single bond from the C to N, then another N connected to the ring closure. Let me see:\n\nThe part is N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)...\n\nSo N=C3 (double bond to C3), then C=C (double bond to another C), then (NN3...). So the C is connected to a branch: (NN3C2=O). So the C is connected to N via a single bond? Let me parse the SMILES:\n\nThe SMILES is C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC... So:\n\n- C2 is connected to N via a double bond (C2=C(N=...)\n- The N is connected to C3 via a double bond (N=C3...)\n- C3 is connected to another C via a double bond (C=C...)\n- That C is connected to a branch: (NN3C2=O). So the C is connected to N via a single bond? Because the SMILES is C=C(NN3...). So the C=C is followed by (NN3...), which is a branch. So the bond between the C and the N in the branch is a single bond. Similarly, the N in the branch is connected to another N? Wait, the branch is NN3C2=O. So the first N is connected to the previous C via a single bond, then connected to another N (NN3...), and then to C2=O. So that's a single bond between the two Ns? Or a double bond?\n\nIn SMILES, unless specified, bonds are single. So NN would be a single bond between the two Ns. Then the second N is connected to C2 via a single bond? Wait, the SMILES is NN3C2=O. So the second N is connected to C2 via a single bond? Because there's no = between N and C2. Then C2 is connected to O via a double bond (C2=O). So that's a ketone group.\n\nSo, in this part, there are single bonds between the C and N in the branch, between the two Ns, and between N and C2. Also, there's a single bond between C2 and O (but that's a double bond, as indicated by =O). Wait, no, the C2=O is a double bond. So the bond between C2 and O is double. The bond between N and C2 is single.\n\nNow, considering rotatable bonds. Let's look at each single bond here. The single bond between the C (from the C=C) and the first N in the branch. Is this bond in a ring? The ring closure is at NN3C2=O, which connects back to C2. So the ring is formed by the N (from N=C3...), the C3, the C=C, the N (branch), then the NN3... connecting back to C2. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize the ring here. The ring closure is at 3 and 2. The SMILES is N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)... So the ring is formed between N (position 3) and C2. Let me see:\n\nThe N=C3 is part of the ring. Then the C3 is connected to another C=C, which is connected to NN3 (the branch). The NN3 connects back to C2, which is part of the original C2=C... So the ring is N (position 3) - C3 - C - N - C2 - ... Wait, this is a five-membered ring? Let me count the atoms in the ring. The ring is formed by N (position 3), C3, the C=C, the N in the branch (NN3), and C2. So five atoms. Therefore, the bonds in this ring are part of the ring and not rotatable. So the single bonds between the C and N in the branch, and between the two Ns are part of the ring? Wait, no. The ring is formed by connecting N3 to C2. The bonds in the ring would be N3-C3, C3-C, C-N (the first N in the branch), N-C2, and C2-N3? Wait, that's five bonds forming a five-membered ring. So the single bonds between C and N (the first N in the branch) and between the two Ns are part of the ring? No, because the ring is formed by the connection between N3 and C2. The single bond between C and N is part of the ring, but the bond between the two Ns is not part of the ring. Wait, the ring is N3-C3-C-C-N-C2-N3? No, the ring is closed by the bond between N3 and C2. So the ring includes N3, C3, the C, the N (from the branch), and C2. So the bonds in the ring are N3-C3 (double bond?), C3-C (double bond?), C-N (single bond?), N-C2 (single bond?), and C2-N3 (single bond? Or is there a bond between C2 and N3?). Wait, the ring closure is NN3C2=O. So the bond that closes the ring is between the N (position 3) and C2. So the ring is N3 connected to C2 via a single bond (since the SMILES is NN3C2=O, implying a single bond between N and C2). Therefore, the ring is N3-C3-C-C-N-C2-N3? No, that would be a six-membered ring. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try again.\n\nThe ring is formed by the bond between N (position 3) and C2. So the atoms in the ring are N3, C3, C (from C=C), the N in the branch (let's call it N4), and C2. So five atoms. Therefore, the bonds in the ring are N3-C3 (double bond?), C3-C (double bond?), C-N4 (single bond?), N4-C2 (single bond?), and C2-N3 (single bond?). Wait, but the bond between C2 and N3 is the one that closes the ring. So that's a single bond. Therefore, the bonds in the ring are N3-C3 (double), C3-C (double), C-N4 (single), N4-C2 (single), and C2-N3 (single). Wait, but that would make the ring have three single bonds and two double bonds. That's possible in a five-membered ring with some double bonds. So the bonds in the ring are part of the ring and thus not rotatable. Therefore, the single bonds between C-N4, N4-C2, and C2-N3 are part of the ring and not rotatable. The double bonds (N3-C3 and C3-C) are also part of the ring and not rotatable.\n\nSo in this part, the single bonds that are in the ring are not rotatable. The other single bonds not in rings need to be considered.\n\nNow, moving on. After the ring, there's C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O. Let's parse this. The C(=O) is a ketone group, connected to N, which is connected to a C, then CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. So the CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4 is another ring. As discussed earlier, this is a five-membered ring. The bonds in this ring are not rotatable.\n\nThen, the rest is C(=O)O, which is a carboxylic acid or ester? Since it's C(=O)O, it's likely a carboxylate (if deprotonated) or an ester. Either way, the bond between C and O is a double bond (C=O) and a single bond (O). The single bond between C and O in the carboxylate is adjacent to a double bond, so it's not rotatable.\n\nNow, let's look for all single bonds in the molecule and determine if they are rotatable.\n\nStarting with the benzene ring: all bonds are in a ring and/or double bonds. No rotatable bonds here.\n\nNext, the part connected to the benzene ring: C2=C(N=C3...). The C2 is connected to the benzene ring via a single bond? Wait, the benzene ring is C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=... So the bond between the benzene ring and C2 is a single bond (since the first part is C1=CC=C(C=C1) and then connected to C2). So that's a single bond between the benzene ring and C2. Is this bond in a ring? The C2 is part of the five-membered ring we discussed earlier. Therefore, the bond between the benzene ring and C2 is a single bond that is part of a ring (the five-membered ring). Therefore, not rotatable.\n\nThen, the bond between C2 and N is a double bond (C2=C(N=...)), so not rotatable.\n\nThe bond between N and C3 is a double bond (N=C3...), not rotatable.\n\nThe bond between C3 and the next C is a double bond (C=C...), not rotatable.\n\nThen, the bond between that C and the first N in the branch (C=C(NN3...)) is a single bond. This bond is part of the five-membered ring, so not rotatable.\n\nThen, the bond between the first N and the second N (NN3...) is a single bond. This bond is part of the five-membered ring, so not rotatable.\n\nThe bond between the second N and C2 is a single bond, part of the ring, so not rotatable.\n\nThen, the bond between C2 and O in C2=O is a double bond, not rotatable.\n\nNow, moving to the C(=O)NC(...) part. The C(=O) is connected to N via a single bond. This bond is between a carbonyl carbon (double bonded to O) and N. The single bond between C=O and N: is this bond adjacent to a double bond? Yes, because the C is double bonded to O. Therefore, this bond is adjacent to a double bond and not rotatable.\n\nThen, the N is connected to a C via a single bond (NC(...)). This bond between N and C: is it adjacent to a double bond? Let's see. The N is connected to C, and the C is connected to another C (CC4...). The bond between N and C is a single bond. Is this bond adjacent to a double bond? The next bond is between C and C (single bond), then to C4. So the N-C bond is not adjacent to a double bond. Also, is this bond in a ring? The next part is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4, which is a ring. The C connected to N is part of the ring? Let's see: CC4=... So the first C after N is connected to another C (C4). Then C4 is part of the ring. So the bond between N and the first C is not in a ring. Therefore, this single bond (N-C) is not in a ring and not adjacent to a double bond. Therefore, it is a rotatable bond. So that's one.\n\nThen, the next part is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. This is the five-membered ring. The bonds in this ring are not rotatable. The first C (after N) is connected to C4 via a single bond. Wait, the SMILES is CC4=... So the first C is connected to C4 via a single bond. But C4 is part of the ring. So the bond between the first C and C4 is part of the ring? Wait, the ring is formed by CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. Let me parse this again. The SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. So starting from the C connected to N, it's connected to C4 (single bond), then C4 is connected to C (double bond), then to C5 (double bond?), etc. Wait, the SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. Breaking it down:\n\n- C (connected to N) is connected to C4 (single bond).\n- C4 is connected to C via a double bond (=C).\n- That C is connected to C5 via a double bond (=C).\n- C5 is connected to C via a double bond (=C).\n- Then another C connected to C via a double bond (=C).\n- Then another C connected to C via a double bond (=C).\n- Then N4 closes the ring.\n\nSo the ring is formed by C4 connected to C5, then to other Cs, and back to N4. Wait, the ring closure is N4. So the ring includes C4, C, C5, C, C, C, and N4? This is getting too complicated. Let me think about the ring structure. The ring is formed by the bond between N4 and the last C in the chain. So the ring is five-membered? Let me count the atoms in the ring. The ring closure is N4. Starting from C4, connected to C (double bond), then to C5 (double bond), then to C (double bond), then to C (double bond), then to N4. So the atoms in the ring are C4, C, C5, C, C, N4. That's six atoms, so a six-membered ring? Wait, but the ring closure is N4. So maybe it's a six-membered ring with five carbon atoms and one nitrogen? But the SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. Let me see:\n\n- C (connected to N) - C4 (single bond)\n- C4 = C (double bond)\n- = C5 (double bond)\n- = C (double bond)\n- = C (double bond)\n- = C (double bond)\n- N4 (closing the ring)\n\nWait, that seems like a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds? But the N4 is connected back to the first C (C4)? So the ring is C4 connected to C, which is connected to C5, then to another C, then to another C, then to another C, and back to N4. That would be five bonds, making a six-membered ring? No, five bonds would make a six-membered ring. So the ring is six-membered. Therefore, the bonds in this ring are part of the ring and not rotatable. The single bond between the N and the first C is outside the ring. So that bond is rotatable, as previously noted.\n\nThen, the rest of the molecule is C(=O)O. The bond between the C and O is a double bond (C=O), so not rotatable. The bond between the C and the other O is a single bond (O), but it's adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so not rotatable.\n\nNow, let's look for other single bonds that might be rotatable.\n\nIn the part CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4, after the ring, there are other bonds. Wait, no, that's part of the ring. So the bonds in the ring are not rotatable.\n\nThen, the rest of the molecule is C6=CC=CO6, which is another ring. The bonds in this ring are not rotatable.\n\nNow, let's check other parts of the molecule. The C(=O)NC(...) part. The N is connected to a C, which is connected to another C (CC4...). The bond between the first C and C4 is single and not in a ring, so that's rotatable (already counted). Then, within the CC4... ring, the bonds are in the ring. So no more there.\n\nWhat about the C(=O)O part? The bond between the C and O is a single bond (the O at the end), but it's adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so not rotatable.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other single bonds not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nLooking back at the SMILES: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6\n\nLet me parse again for any other single bonds.\n\nIn the part C2=C(N=C3...), we already considered the bonds. The bond between the benzene ring and C2 is single and in a ring. The bond between C2 and N is double. The bond between N and C3 is double. The bond between C3 and C is double. The bond between C and N in the branch is single (part of ring). The bond between the two Ns is single (part of ring). The bond between N and C2 is single (part of ring). Then, the C(=O) is connected to N via single bond (adjacent to double bond, not rotatable). The N is connected to C via single bond (rotatable, counted). The C is connected to C4 via single bond (part of ring, not rotatable). Then the rest of the ring bonds are in the ring.\n\nWhat about the part after the ring? The C(=O)O is connected via a single bond to the previous C? Wait, the SMILES is ...C(=O)NC(...)C(=O)O. So the C(=O) is connected to N, which is connected to a C, which is connected to the ring (CC4...), and then the ring is connected to another C(=O)O? Wait, the full part is C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O. So the structure is: a C=O connected to N, which is connected to a C, which is connected to CC4... (the ring), and then this C is connected to another C(=O)O. So the bond between the ring's C and the C(=O)O is a single bond. Let me check if this bond is in a ring or adjacent to a double bond.\n\nThe bond is between the ring's C and the C(=O)O. The ring's C is part of the five-membered ring (CC4...), so the bond between the ring and the C(=O)O is a single bond not in a ring. Is it adjacent to a double bond? The C(=O)O has a double bond to O. So the single bond between the ring's C and the C(=O)O is adjacent to a double bond (C=O). Therefore, this bond is not rotatable.\n\nNow, what about the bonds in the ring C6=CC=CO6? The bonds in this ring are part of the ring, so not rotatable.\n\nAre there any other single bonds? Let's check the entire SMILES again.\n\nThe SMILES is: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6\n\nLooking for any other single bonds. For example, in the part C=C(NN3...), the N is connected to another N (single bond), which is connected to C2 (single bond). These bonds are part of the ring and not rotatable.\n\nIn the part C(=O)NC(...), the N is connected to C (single bond, rotatable), which is connected to C4 (single bond, part of ring). The C4 is part of the ring.\n\nIn the ring CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4, all bonds are either in the ring or double bonds. The single bond between the N and the first C is already counted.\n\nNow, let's consider the C6=CC=CO6 part. This is a ring, so bonds are not rotatable.\n\nIs there any other single bond that is not in a ring and not adjacent to a double bond? Let's think.\n\nThe bond between the N and the first C in the CC4... part is one rotatable bond.\n\nWhat about the bond between the benzene ring and the C2? It's a single bond but part of a ring, so not rotatable.\n\nWhat about the bond between the ring (CC4...) and the C(=O)O? Adjacent to a double bond, so not rotatable.\n\nIs there another bond in the C(=O)NC(...) part? The N is connected to C, which is connected to C4. The bond between N and C is rotatable. The bond between C and C4 is part of the ring. Any other bonds in the NC(...) part?\n\nThe C in the NC(...) is connected to another C (CC4...), which is part of the ring. So no other bonds there.\n\nWhat about the bond between the ring (CC4...) and the rest of the molecule? The ring is connected to the C(=O)O via a single bond adjacent to a double bond.\n\nNow, let's check the part with the ring C6=CC=CO6. The SMILES is C6=CC=CO6. This is a ring, so bonds are not rotatable.\n\nWait, but there might be a bond between the previous part and this ring. Let me see. The SMILES is ...C2=C(...)C6=CC=CO6. So the previous part is connected to C6 via a bond. Let me parse the SMILES again. The full SMILES is:\n\nC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6\n\nSo after the C(=O)O part, there's a C6=CC=CO6. The bond connecting the previous part to C6 is a single bond? Let me see. The part before is ...C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6. So the bond between the previous part (which ends with C(=O)O) and C6 is a single bond? Wait, the SMILES is ...C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6. So after the C(=O)O, there's a C6 connected via a single bond. But wait, the previous part ends with C(=O)O. How is C6 connected to that? The SMILES is written as ...C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6. So the bond between the previous C (which is connected to O) and C6 is a single bond. Is this bond in a ring? Yes, because C6 is part of the ring C6=CC=CO6. So the bond between the previous C and C6 is a single bond that is part of a ring. Therefore, not rotatable.\n\nSo, in this case, the only rotatable bond so far is the one between the N and the first C in the CC4... part. Are there any others?\n\nLet me think again. The molecule has a benzene ring, a five-membered ring, another five-membered ring, and another ring (C6...O6). The only single bonds not in rings are:\n\n1. Between N and C in the NC(...) part (already counted).\n2. Are there any other single bonds not in rings?\n\nLet me check the SMILES again for any other single bonds. For example, in the part N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)..., the bond between N and C3 is double. The bond between C3 and C is double. The bond between C and N in the branch is single (part of ring). The bond between N and another N is single (part of ring). The bond between N and C2 is single (part of ring).\n\nIn the C(=O)NC(...) part, the bond between C=O and N is single but adjacent to double bond. The bond between N and C is single and not in ring or adjacent to double bond (counted). The bond between C and C4 is single and part of ring.\n\nIn the ring CC4=..., all bonds are in ring or double bonds.\n\nIn the C(=O)O part, the single bond is adjacent to double bond.\n\nIn the C6=CC=CO6 ring, bonds are in ring.\n\nSo only one rotatable bond so far? That can't be right because the options are up to 19. I must have missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the SMILES. Let me try again more carefully.\n\nThe SMILES is:\n\nC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6\n\nLet me try to draw it step by step.\n\n1. Benzene ring: C1=CC=C(C=C1) → a benzene ring with a substituent at position 1, which is C2=...\n\n2. C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)... → So the benzene ring is connected to a C2 which is double bonded to N. The N is double bonded to C3. C3 is double bonded to another C. This C is connected to a branch: NN3C2=O. So the ring here is formed by N3 and C2. The branch is NN3C2=O, which connects back to C2. So the ring is N3-C3-C-N-N-C2-N3? No, it's a five-membered ring: N3, C3, C, N, C2. So the bonds in this ring are part of the ring.\n\nThen, this part is connected to C(=O)NC(...)C(=O)O.\n\nThe C(=O) is a ketone connected to N. The N is connected to a C, which is connected to CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. This is the ring we discussed earlier, a five-membered ring? Or six? Earlier analysis suggested it's a five-membered ring, but I'm not sure. Let me parse CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4.\n\nThe SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. So starting from the C connected to N, it's connected to C4 (single bond). C4 is double bonded to C, which is double bonded to C5, then double bonded to C, then double bonded to C, then double bonded to C, then double bonded to C5, and then connected to N4. Wait, this seems like a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. Let me count the atoms in the ring: C4, C, C5, C, C, C, N4? No, the ring is closed by connecting back to N4. Let me count the bonds. Starting from C4, connected to C (double bond), then to C5 (double bond), then to C (double bond), then to C (double bond), then to C (double bond), then to N4. That's five double bonds and one single bond? Or maybe it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds? I'm getting confused here. Let's try to count the number of atoms in the ring. The ring closure is at N4. So the ring includes C4, C, C5, C, C, C, and N4? That's seven atoms? No, the SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. Let me write it as:\n\nC (from N) - C4 (single bond)\nC4 = C (double)\n= C5 (double)\n= C (double)\n= C (double)\n= C (double)\n= C (double)\nN4 (closing the ring)\n\nWait, that's too many. Let me parse it correctly. The SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. Breaking it down:\n\n- C (from N) is connected to C4 (single bond)\n- C4 is connected to C via a double bond (=C)\n- This C is connected to C5 via a double bond (=C)\n- C5 is connected to C via a double bond (=C)\n- This C is connected to C via a double bond (=C)\n- This C is connected to C via a double bond (=C)\n- This C is connected to N4 via a double bond? No, the SMILES ends with N4. Wait, the last part is C=C5N4. So the last bond is between C and N4. Since there's no = before N4, it's a single bond. So the SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. So:\n\n- C (from N) - C4 (single)\n- C4 = C (double)\n- = C5 (double)\n- = C (double)\n- = C (double)\n- = C (double)\n- = C (double)\n- N4 (single bond)\n\nBut this would make the ring have multiple double bonds. However, the ring closure is at N4, so the bond between the last C and N4 is single. This seems like a six-membered ring with five double bonds and one single bond, which is not typical. Perhaps it's a typo, but assuming the SMILES is correct, this part forms a ring where the bonds between C4 and C, C and C5, etc., are double bonds, and the bond between the last C and N4 is single. Therefore, the bonds in this ring are either double or single, but part of the ring. Therefore, any single bonds in this ring are not rotatable.\n\nThe bond between the N and the first C (from N to C4) is single and not in a ring, so it's rotatable (already counted). Are there other single bonds not in rings?\n\nLet me think about the entire molecule again. Perhaps there are more single bonds that are not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nFor example, in the part C(=O)NC(...), the bond between N and C is rotatable. Then, within the ring CC4..., are there any single bonds not in the ring? No, because the ring is formed with those bonds.\n\nWait, what about the bond between the ring CC4... and the C(=O)O? That bond is single but adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so not rotatable.\n\nNow, what about the bond between the ring CC4... and the rest of the molecule? It's connected to the C(=O)O, which we already considered.\n\nAre there any other single bonds in the molecule?\n\nLet me look at the SMILES again: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6\n\nLet me check if there are other substituents or branches that might have single bonds.\n\nIn the part C2=C(N=C3...), the N is connected to a branch: NN3C2=O. This branch has a single bond between N and N, and between N and C2. These bonds are part of the ring, so not rotatable.\n\nIn the C(=O)NC(...) part, the N is connected to C, which is connected to CC4..., and then to C(=O)O. We've considered those bonds.\n\nIn the C6=CC=CO6 part, it's a ring, so no rotatable bonds there.\n\nWait, maybe there are other single bonds in the main chain. For example, between the benzene ring and C2, which is a single bond but part of a ring. Not rotatable.\n\nBetween C2 and N: double bond.\n\nBetween N and C3: double bond.\n\nBetween C3 and C: double bond.\n\nBetween C and N (branch): single bond, part of ring.\n\nBetween N and N: single bond, part of ring.\n\nBetween N and C2: single bond, part of ring.\n\nBetween C2 and O: double bond.\n\nBetween C=O and N: single bond, adjacent to double bond, not rotatable.\n\nBetween N and C: single bond, rotatable (1).\n\nBetween C and C4: single bond, part of ring.\n\nBetween C4 and C: double bond, part of ring.\n\nThen, the rest of the ring bonds are in the ring.\n\nBetween the ring and C(=O)O: single bond, adjacent to double bond.\n\nBetween C(=O)O and C6: single bond, part of ring.\n\nBetween C6 and other Cs in the ring: bonds in ring.\n\nSo, so far, only one rotatable bond? That seems too low given the options. I must have missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the bond between the ring CC4... and the C(=O)O is not adjacent to a double bond. Let me recheck. The C(=O)O is connected to the ring via a single bond. The C(=O)O has a double bond to O, but the single bond is between the ring's C and the C in C(=O)O. Is this bond adjacent to a double bond? Yes, because the C is double bonded to O. So the single bond between the ring's C and the C(=O)O is adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so not rotatable.\n\nWhat about the bond between the N and the C in the NC(...) part? That's one rotatable bond. Are there others?\n\nLet me think about the part C(=O)NC(...). The N is connected to a C, which is connected to a C4 in the ring. The bond between N and C is rotatable. What about the bond between C and C4? Part of the ring. No.\n\nAre there other single bonds in the molecule? Let me think about the SMILES again. The SMILES is complex, but perhaps there are other branches or substituents.\n\nFor example, in the part CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4, maybe there are substituents that add single bonds. Let me parse it again: CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. This is a ring with substituents? Or is it just the ring? It seems like it's a ring with substituents. Wait, the SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. Starting from the C connected to N, it goes to C4 (single bond), then to C (double bond), then to C5 (double bond), then to C (double bond), then to C (double bond), then to C (double bond), then to N4. This seems like a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds, but with some substituents. However, the bonds in the ring are either double or single (the bond to N4 is single). Therefore, any single bonds in this ring are part of the ring and not rotatable.\n\nWait, maybe there are other single bonds in the molecule. For example, in the part C=C(NN3...), the bond between C and N is single and part of the ring. What about the bond between the N and the next N? Single and part of the ring.\n\nLet me consider the entire molecule again. Perhaps I missed some single bonds in the main chain.\n\nThe molecule has a benzene ring, a five-membered ring, a six-membered ring, and another ring. The only single bond not in a ring and not adjacent to a double bond is the one between N and C in the NC(...) part. But this seems too few. The options given are up to 19, so I must have missed many.\n\nMaybe my initial assumption about the rings is incorrect. Let me try to use another approach. Count all single bonds in the molecule and then subtract those that are in rings or adjacent to double bonds.\n\nTo do this, I need to know the number of single bonds and identify which are in rings or adjacent to double bonds.\n\nBut without drawing the molecule, this is challenging. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the SMILES to count the number of single bonds and estimate.\n\nThe SMILES has many single bonds. For example, every time there's no = or #, it's a single bond.\n\nLet me count all single bonds in the SMILES:\n\nThe SMILES is: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N=C3C=C(NN3C2=O)C(=O)NC(CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4)C(=O)O)C6=CC=CO6\n\nLet me go through each bond:\n\n1. C1=CC=C(C=C1): This is a benzene ring. The bonds are alternating double and single bonds in the ring. The bonds between the ring and substituents are single bonds. The bond between the ring and C2 is single.\n\n2. C2=C: double bond.\n\n3. N=C3: double bond.\n\n4. C=C: double bond.\n\n5. (NN3...): single bonds in the branch.\n\n6. C(=O): double bond.\n\n7. NC: single bond.\n\n8. CC4: single bond.\n\n9. =CC5: double bond.\n\n10. =CC: double bond.\n\n11. =CC: double bond.\n\n12. =C5N4: double bond and single bond to N4.\n\n13. C(=O)O: double bond and single bond.\n\n14. C6=CC=CO6: double bonds and single bond.\n\nThis is very fragmented, but let's try to count all single bonds:\n\n- In the benzene ring: each carbon has one single bond (alternating with double bonds), but they are part of the ring.\n\n- The bond between the benzene ring and C2: single bond.\n\n- In the C2=C(N=C3...): the bond between C2 and N is double.\n\n- The bond between N and C3 is double.\n\n- The bond between C3 and C is double.\n\n- The bond between C and the first N in the branch: single bond.\n\n- The bond between the two Ns in the branch: single bond.\n\n- The bond between the second N and C2: single bond.\n\n- The bond between C2 and O: double bond.\n\n- The bond between C=O and N: single bond.\n\n- The bond between N and C: single bond (already counted).\n\n- The bond between C and C4: single bond.\n\n- The bonds in the CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4 part: single bonds between C and C4, and between C and N4 (single bond). The other bonds are double.\n\n- The bond between the ring's C and C(=O)O: single bond.\n\n- The bond between the previous part and C6: single bond (part of the ring).\n\n- Bonds in the C6=CC=CO6 ring: some single and double bonds, but part of the ring.\n\nNow, letting's list all single bonds that are not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds:\n\n1. Bond between benzene ring and C2: single bond in a ring (part of the five-membered ring) → not rotatable.\n\n2. Bond between C and first N in the branch: part of ring → not rotatable.\n\n3. Bond between two Ns: part of ring → not rotatable.\n\n4. Bond between N and C2: part of ring → not rotatable.\n\n5. Bond between C=O and N: adjacent to double bond → not rotatable.\n\n6. Bond between N and C: not in ring, not adjacent to double bond → rotatable (1).\n\n7. Bond between C and C4: part of ring → not rotatable.\n\n8. Bond between ring's C and C(=O)O: adjacent to double bond → not rotatable.\n\n9. Bond between previous part and C6: part of ring → not rotatable.\n\nSo only one rotatable bond? This can't be right. The options are up to 19, so I must have missed many. Perhaps I'm undercounting because there are more single bonds not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds.\n\nLet me think again about the part CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. This is a ring, but maybe there are substituents on it that have single bonds. For example, the SMILES is CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. Let's parse it as:\n\n- C (connected to N) - C4 (single bond)\n- C4 = C (double)\n- = C5 (double)\n- = C (double)\n- = C (double)\n- = C (double)\n- = C (double)\n- N4 (single bond)\n\nThis seems like a six-membered ring with substituents, but all the bonds are either double or part of the ring. However, if there are substituents on the ring, they might add single bonds. For example, the C5 in the SMILES might be part of a substituent, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ring is not closed, and there are other single bonds. This is getting too complicated without drawing the molecule.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that each amide bond (C(=O)N) has a single bond between C and N, which is not rotatable because it's adjacent to a double bond. But in the SMILES, there is a C(=O)NC(...), so the bond between C=O and N is single and adjacent to double bond, not rotatable. The bond between N and the next C is single and not adjacent to a double bond, so rotatable. Similarly, if there are other amide or ester groups, their bonds might add rotatable bonds.\n\nWait, in the SMILES, there is C(=O)O, which is a carboxylate group. The bond between C and O is a single bond adjacent to a double bond (C=O), so not rotatable.\n\nNow, let me think about the entire molecule. It has a benzene ring, a pyridine-like ring, a ring with a nitrogen (CC4...), and another ring. The only single bond that is not in a ring and not adjacent to a double bond is the one between N and C in the NC(...) part. But this seems too few.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which bonds are in rings. For example, the bond between the N and C in the NC(...) part might be part of a ring. Let me check: the N is part of the ring formed by N3 and C2, and the C is part of that ring. So the bond between N and C is part of the ring, hence not rotatable. But earlier I thought it was not part of the ring. This is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that my analysis is flawed, and I need a better approach.\n\nMaybe I should use the concept that rotatable bonds are typically single bonds not in rings and not adjacent to double bonds. To count them, I need to identify all such bonds.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that this molecule is a derivative of a known compound, and the number of rotatable bonds is among the given options. Given that the options are 19, 7, 14, 18, and the correct answer is likely one of these, I need to estimate.\n\nA large molecule like this, with multiple rings and side chains, might have around 10-20 rotatable bonds. Given that I identified one, but likely missed others, let's try to think of possible single bonds.\n\nFor example, in the part CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4, if it's a six-membered ring with substituents, there might be single bonds between substituents and the ring. For instance, if there is a side chain on the ring, the bond between the ring and the side chain would be a single bond not in a ring and not adjacent to a double bond, hence rotatable.\n\nLooking at the SMILES CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4, it might have substituents like CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4. The part CC4=CC5=CC=CC=C5N4 could have multiple substituents, each adding a single bond. For example, if there is a branch at C5, it would add a single bond.\n\nHowever, without drawing the molecule, it's hard to tell. Given the time I've spent and the need to choose from the options, I'll try to make an educated guess.\n\nIf the correct answer is among the options, and considering that complex molecules often have many rotatable bonds, 14 or 18 might be plausible. Between the options, I'll go with 14 as a reasonable number for a molecule with several rings and some side chains.\n</think>"}
