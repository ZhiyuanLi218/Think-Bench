The heat capacity c is given in two regions: when T₀/2 < T < T₀, c = c_max*(2T/T₀ - 1), and otherwise c = 0. Alright, let me recall how heat capacity relates to entropy.\n\nI remember that the entropy change ΔS is the integral of the heat capacity divided by temperature over the temperature interval. The formula is ΔS = ∫(c/T) dT from T_initial to T_final. So in this case, since the heat capacity is zero except between T₀/2 and T₀, I think the integral will only be non-zero in that interval. But wait, the problem says the temperature increases from T=0 to T > T₀. So the total entropy change should be the integral from 0 to T₀/2 (where c=0), then from T₀/2 to T₀ (where c is given), and then from T₀ to higher temperatures (where c=0 again). Therefore, only the middle part contributes.\n\nSo, mathematically, ΔS = ∫₀^T_final (c/T) dT. Since c is zero except between T₀/2 and T₀, and T_final is greater than T₀, so the integral becomes ∫_{T₀/2}^{T₀} [c_max*(2T/T₀ - 1)/T] dT. Let me write that down:\n\nΔS = ∫_{T₀/2}^{T₀} [c_max*(2T/T₀ - 1)/T] dT.\n\nSimplify the integrand: (2T/T₀ - 1)/T = 2/T₀ - 1/T. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\nΔS = c_max ∫_{T₀/2}^{T₀} [2/T₀ - 1/T] dT.\n\nLet me compute that integral step by step. First, split the integral into two parts:\n\nΔS = c_max [ ∫_{T₀/2}^{T₀} 2/T₀ dT - ∫_{T₀/2}^{T₀} 1/T dT ].\n\nCompute the first integral: ∫ 2/T₀ dT from T₀/2 to T₀. Since 2/T₀ is a constant with respect to T, it becomes 2/T₀ * (T₀ - T₀/2) = 2/T₀*(T₀/2) = 1.\n\nSecond integral: ∫ 1/T dT from T₀/2 to T₀ is ln(T) evaluated from T₀/2 to T₀, which is ln(T₀) - ln(T₀/2) = ln(T₀ / (T₀/2)) = ln(2).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nΔS = c_max [1 - ln(2)].\n\nWait, let me check the signs. The second integral is subtracted, so it's 2/T₀ integral minus 1/T integral. Which gives 1 - ln(2). So the total entropy change is c_max*(1 - ln 2). Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nΔS = c_max [ (2/T₀)*(T₀ - T₀/2) - (ln T₀ - ln(T₀/2)) ]\n\nWhich is c_max [ (2/T₀)*(T₀/2) - ln(T₀ / (T₀/2)) ] = c_max [1 - ln(2)]. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is ΔS = c_max*(1 - ln 2). But wait, let me check if I did the integral correctly.\n\nLet me redo the integral step-by-step:\n\nFirst integral: ∫_{T₀/2}^{T₀} 2/T₀ dT = 2/T₀ * (T₀ - T₀/2) = 2/T₀*(T₀/2) = 1. Correct.\n\nSecond integral: ∫_{T₀/2}^{T₀} (1/T) dT = ln(T₀) - ln(T₀/2) = ln( T₀ / (T₀/2) ) = ln(2). Correct.\n\nTherefore, ΔS = c_max*(1 - ln 2). But wait, entropy change is positive? Let me check the numbers. 1 - ln 2 ≈ 1 - 0.693 ≈ 0.307. Positive. Since entropy increases with temperature, and we are going from 0 K to higher temperatures, the total entropy change should be positive. So that seems okay.\n\nBut let me think again about the physical process. The system goes from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism. At T=0, in a ferromagnet, the spins are aligned, so the entropy is zero. But when you heat it up, it goes through a phase transition. However, the problem says it's a transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism. Wait, usually, ferromagnetism occurs below the Curie temperature, and above it's paramagnetic. So if we are increasing temperature from 0 to above T₀, we are going from ferromagnetic (at T=0) to paramagnetic (at T > T₀). Therefore, the entropy should increase, which matches our result because ΔS is positive. So that makes sense.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other contribution. The heat capacity is zero below T₀/2 and above T₀. So between 0 and T₀/2, c=0, so no entropy change there. Between T₀/2 and T₀, c is linear in T (since 2T/T₀ - 1 is linear). Then above T₀, c is zero again. Therefore, integrating c/T over temperature gives us the total entropy change. Which we found as c_max*(1 - ln 2). But let me check if the integral was set up correctly.\n\nOriginal heat capacity c = c_max*(2T/T₀ - 1) for T₀/2 < T < T₀. So when we write dS = (c/T) dT, that's correct. So integrating that gives the entropy change. So yes, the setup is correct.\n\nBut let me check units. Heat capacity at constant pressure? Well, assuming it's molar heat capacity, and entropy is in J/(mol·K). The integral of c/T dT would have units of J/(mol·K^2) * K = J/(mol·K), which is correct for entropy. So units are okay.\n\nAnother sanity check: The maximum heat capacity c_max occurs at T = T₀. Let's see: At T = T₀, 2T/T₀ - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, so c = c_max. At T = T₀/2, 2*(T₀/2)/T₀ - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0. So the heat capacity starts at zero when T = T₀/2, rises linearly to c_max at T = T₀. So the graph of c vs T is a straight line from (T₀/2, 0) to (T₀, c_max). Then, when we integrate c/T dT, we can perhaps visualize it as the area under the curve of c/T vs T.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to think about it. Let me check if my answer is dimensionally correct. If c_max is in J/(mol·K), then integrating c_max*(...) dT would have units J/(mol·K) * K = J/mol, which is entropy. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, c is in J/(mol·K). Then c/T is in J/(mol·K^2). Integrating over dT (K) gives J/(mol·K), which is correct for entropy. So yes, the units are okay.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the integral ∫ c dT / T, which is ∫ (c_max*(2T/T₀ - 1)/T ) dT. Which simplifies to ∫ c_max*(2/T₀ - 1/T) dT. Which is what I did earlier. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the change in entropy ΔS is c_max multiplied by (1 - ln 2). Let me just write that as ΔS = c_max (1 - ln 2). Since ln 2 is approximately 0.693, 1 - ln 2 ≈ 0.307, so ΔS ≈ 0.307 c_max. But the question probably expects an exact expression, so 1 - ln 2.\n\nWait, but let me check once more the integral:\n\n∫_{T₀/2}^{T₀} [2/T₀ - 1/T] dT = [2/T₀ * T - ln T] from T₀/2 to T₀.\n\nAt upper limit T₀: 2/T₀ * T₀ - ln T₀ = 2 - ln T₀.\n\nAt lower limit T₀/2: 2/T₀*(T₀/2) - ln(T₀/2) = 1 - ln(T₀/2).\n\nSubtracting lower limit from upper limit:\n\n[2 - ln T₀] - [1 - ln(T₀/2)] = 2 - ln T₀ -1 + ln(T₀/2) = 1 + ln( (T₀/2)/T₀ ) = 1 + ln(1/2) = 1 - ln 2. Exactly. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entropy change is ΔS = c_max*(1 - ln 2). So that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's a possibility that the heat capacity is given as molar heat capacity, so c is in J/(mol·K), and then integrating c/T dT would give entropy per mole. The problem says \"change in entropy ΔS as the temperature increases from T = 0 K to T > T₀\", so assuming it's per mole since it's molar heat capacity. So the answer is ΔS = c_max*(1 - ln 2). So boxed, it would be \\boxed{c_{\\text{max}}(1 - \\ln 2)}.\n\nYes, that seems right. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe change in entropy is \\boxed{c_{\\text{max}}(1 - \\ln 2)}.\n</think>"}
