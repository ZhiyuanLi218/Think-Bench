So, the question is about two exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have the same minimum mass as Neptune. Their orbital inclinations are both 30 degrees. Planet 1 is in a circular orbit, while Planet 2 has an elliptical orbit with a radius ratio of apoapsis to periapsis of 1.5. The wavelength shifts for the spectral lines are given as 4 milliAngstroms for Planet 1 and 1.77 MeV for Planet 2. Wait, hold on, MeV is a unit of energy, not wavelength. That must be a typo or maybe a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host star of planet #2 corresponds to 1.77 MeV.\" Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wavelength shifts are usually measured in units like Angstroms, meters, or nanometers. MeV is mega-electron volts, which is an energy unit. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps it's a trick question? Alternatively, maybe they meant 1.77 milliAngstroms? But the answer choices are given, so maybe I need to find a way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a conversion between energy and wavelength? Let me recall the relation between energy and wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So if they mention an energy shift, maybe they are referring to the energy difference corresponding to the Doppler shift? But that seems complicated. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's focus on what we know. Both planets have the same minimum mass (m sin i), which is the same as Neptune's mass. The stars have the same mass as the Sun. The inclination is the same for both planets (30 degrees), so their true masses are the same as Neptune's divided by sin(30°), which is 2 times Neptune's mass. Wait, no: the minimum mass is m sin i, so if m sin i is the same as Neptune's mass, and i is 30°, then the actual mass m is Neptune's mass / sin(30°) = Neptune's mass / 0.5 = 2 times Neptune's mass. So both planets have the same true mass. But since the problem says \"minimum masses similar to that of Neptune\", maybe they are referring to m sin i, which is the same for both. But the inclination is the same for both, so their actual masses are the same. So maybe that's not the main issue here.\n\nThe key here is to find the orbital period ratio between Planet 2 and Planet 1. Since Planet 1 is in a circular orbit, its semi-major axis is equal to the radius. For Planet 2, which has an elliptical orbit, the ratio of apoapsis to periapsis is 1.5. Apoapsis is the farthest point, and periapsis is the closest. The ratio of these two is (a(1 + e)) / (a(1 - e)) = (1 + e)/(1 - e) = 1.5. Let me solve for the eccentricity e.\n\nSo:\n\n(1 + e)/(1 - e) = 1.5\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - e):\n\n1 + e = 1.5(1 - e)\n\n1 + e = 1.5 - 1.5e\n\nBring terms with e to the left:\n\ne + 1.5e = 1.5 - 1\n\n2.5e = 0.5\n\ne = 0.5 / 2.5 = 0.2\n\nSo the eccentricity of Planet 2's orbit is 0.2.\n\nNow, for Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis. The formula is P² = (a³) * (M/(M_sun)) where P is in years and a is in AU if the mass is in solar masses. Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M = 1.\n\nBut for Planet 1, which is in a circular orbit, the semi-major axis a1 is determined by the radial velocity measurements. For Planet 2, even though the orbit is elliptical, the semi-major axis a2 will still be related to the period via Kepler's third law. So the key is to find the semi-major axes of both planets, then compute the periods and take the ratio.\n\nBut how do we find the semi-major axes from the radial velocity data?\n\nThe radial velocity method measures the velocity of the star due to the gravitational pull of the planet. The amplitude of the radial velocity is given by:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) for an eccentric orbit.\n\nBut for a circular orbit (e = 0), it simplifies to:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3))\n\nBut wait, actually, the formula for K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:\n\nK = (2π G / (P))^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) * something else?\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula. The radial velocity amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) * [ (1 + e sin ω) / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ] ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the standard formula.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude for a star due to a planet is:\n\nK = (2π G / (P))^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²))\n\nBut for a circular orbit (e = 0), this simplifies to:\n\nK = (2π G / (P))^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3))\n\nBut this seems a bit complex. Alternatively, maybe we can use the relation between the velocity and the orbital parameters.\n\nThe star's velocity due to the planet's orbit is related to the orbital period and the semi-major axis. Since the star and the planet orbit their common center of mass, the velocity of the star is:\n\nV_star = (2π a_star) / P\n\nWhere a_star is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass. For a planet with mass m and star with mass M, the distance a_star is given by:\n\na_star = (m / M) * a\n\nWhere a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since M is much larger than m, a_star is very small, but for the purposes of velocity, we can write:\n\nV_star = (2π a_star) / P = (2π (m/M) a) / P\n\nBut also, from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² / G(M + m)) a³ ≈ (4π² / G M) a³ since m << M.\n\nSo rearranging, a³ = (G M P²) / (4π²)\n\nTherefore, substituting into V_star:\n\nV_star ≈ (2π (m/M) / P) * [ (G M P²) / (4π²) ) ]^(1/3)\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, a³ = (G M P²) / (4π²)\n\nSo a = [ (G M P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)\n\nThen, a_star = (m/M) * a = (m/M) * [ (G M P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )\n\nTherefore, V_star = 2π a_star / P = 2π / P * (m/M) * [ (G M P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me simplify the expression inside:\n\n[ (G M P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 ) = [ (G M / 4π²) ]^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\nSo substituting back:\n\nV_star ≈ 2π / P * (m/M) * [ (G M / 4π²) ]^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\nSimplify the P terms: 1/P * P^(2/3) = P^(-1/3)\n\nThus:\n\nV_star ≈ 2π * (m/M) * [ (G M / 4π²) ]^(1/3) * P^(-1/3)\n\nRearranged:\n\nV_star ≈ [ (2π (m/M) [ (G M / 4π²) ]^(1/3) ) / P^(1/3) ]\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a standard formula for K. Let me recall that the radial velocity amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²))\n\nWait, but I need to check the exact formula. Let me look up the formula for K.\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) * [ (1 + e sin ω) / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]\n\nBut for a circular orbit (e = 0), and assuming that the argument of periastron ω is 0 (which might not affect much if it's not specified), this simplifies to:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3))\n\nBut since we are dealing with both planets having the same m sin i (since their minimum masses are the same), and same M (same star mass), then the ratio of their K values can be related to their orbital periods and eccentricities.\n\nBut here's the problem: the problem gives the wavelength shifts for both planets. For Planet 1, it's a periodic shift of up to 4 milliAngstroms in a spectral line. For Planet 2, it's 1.77 MeV. Wait, MeV is energy. That must be a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the problem meant to say that the energy shift is 1.77 MeV? But that still doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant 1.77 milliAngstroms? But the answer options are given, so maybe there's a way to convert the given data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the energy of the photons corresponding to the Doppler shift. But that seems complicated. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's handle Planet 1. The wavelength shift is 4 milliAngstroms. Let's denote Δλ/λ for Planet 1. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, where v is the velocity of the star, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSo if we have a spectral line with a given wavelength λ, the shift Δλ is related to the velocity K (the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity). So Δλ/λ ≈ K / c.\n\nGiven that Δλ is 4 milliAngstroms, which is 4 × 10^-3 Angstroms. Let's assume the original wavelength λ is in the visible range, say 5000 Angstroms (as a typical example). But since the actual value of λ is not given, perhaps the problem is assuming that the same spectral line is observed, so λ is the same for both planets. Therefore, the ratio of the wavelength shifts would correspond to the ratio of the velocities K.\n\nBut the problem says that for Planet 2, the periodic wavelength shift corresponds to 1.77 MeV. That part is confusing. Let me check if there's a way to interpret 1.77 MeV as a velocity.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe instead of MeV, it's supposed to be milliAngstroms? If so, then maybe we can proceed. Let me assume that the problem meant that Planet 2's wavelength shift is 1.77 milliAngstroms. Then, the ratio of the velocities K1/K2 would be Δλ1/Δλ2 = 4 / 1.77 ≈ 2.26. But that would be if they are both circular orbits. However, since Planet 2 has an eccentric orbit, the formula for K includes a factor of 1 / sqrt(1 - e²). So let's see.\n\nLet me proceed with that assumption first. Let's say the problem has a typo and Planet 2's wavelength shift is 1.77 milliAngstroms. Then, the ratio of K1 to K2 would be 4 / 1.77 ≈ 2.26. But since K is related to the orbital parameters, we can use that to find the ratio of the semi-major axes or the periods.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is correct in stating that the energy is 1.77 MeV, then perhaps we need to relate energy to velocity. Let's think about that.\n\nThe energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. A Doppler shift would change the wavelength from λ to λ + Δλ. The corresponding energy change ΔE would be approximately E - E' = hc/λ - hc/(λ + Δλ) ≈ hc Δλ / λ². But this is getting complicated. However, if the problem is giving the energy corresponding to the velocity shift, perhaps they are using the relativistic Doppler effect or something else. But this seems too complex for an exam problem, and the mention of MeV is confusing. Since the answer options are numerical, maybe there's a way to convert the given data into a velocity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing units in a different way. Let me check the units again. The problem states for Planet 1: a periodic shift of up to 4 milliAngstroms. For Planet 2: the same spectral line's periodic wavelength shift corresponds to 1.77 MeV. Wait, maybe they are talking about the energy of the star's motion? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe they meant that the energy difference is 1.77 MeV, which would correspond to a certain velocity? Let me try.\n\nIf we consider the kinetic energy of the star's motion, but that seems unrelated to the Doppler shift. Alternatively, maybe they are referring to the energy of the photons being shifted? Let's try to compute the velocity corresponding to 1.77 MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the star's motion is (1/2) M v², but that's not directly related to the Doppler shift. However, if we consider the photon's energy shift, perhaps using the relativistic Doppler shift formula. But this is getting too complicated, and I suspect there's a typo in the problem. Given that, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the problem meant 1.77 milliAngstroms for Planet 2. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, assuming Δλ for Planet 2 is 1.77 milliAngstroms. Then, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes K1/K2 would be (Δλ1/λ) / (Δλ2/λ) = Δλ1/Δλ2 = 4 / 1.77 ≈ 2.26.\n\nBut since Planet 2 has an eccentric orbit, the formula for K includes a factor of 1 / sqrt(1 - e²). Let me recall the exact formula for K in an eccentric orbit. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) * [ (1 + e sin ω) / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]\n\nBut for simplicity, if we assume that the argument of periastron ω is 90 degrees (which might not be given), or if we take the average value, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can use the standard formula that for an eccentric orbit, the K is increased by a factor of 1 / sqrt(1 - e²) compared to a circular orbit. Wait, actually, I think the correct formula is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 + e sin ω) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nBut since ω is the argument of periastron, which is not given, we can't determine it. However, if we assume that the maximum velocity occurs at periapsis, and the minimum at apoapsis, but the problem states that the wavelength shift is periodic, so the semi-amplitude K would be the maximum velocity shift. For an eccentric orbit, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) * [ (1 + e sin ω) / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Maybe a simpler approach is to use the fact that for the radial velocity method, the observed K is related to the velocity of the star, which depends on the orbital parameters. For a circular orbit, the formula is simpler. For an eccentric orbit, there's a correction factor. However, since the problem gives the same m sin i for both planets, and the same star mass, we can relate their K values.\n\nLet me denote K1 for Planet 1 (circular) and K2 for Planet 2 (eccentric). The ratio K1/K2 would be [ (2π G / P1)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) ] / [ (2π G / P2)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * correction factor ].\n\nWait, actually, for Planet 2, the formula for K includes an additional factor depending on e and ω. But since the problem doesn't give us ω, maybe we can assume that the correction factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - e²). Let me check some references in my mind. The standard formula for K in an eccentric orbit is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 + e sin ω) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nBut since ω is unknown, we can't determine the exact value. However, if we assume that the maximum velocity occurs when sin ω = 1 (i.e., the planet is at periastron when the velocity is maximum), then the factor becomes (1 + e)/sqrt(1 - e²). But the problem says that the wavelength shift is periodic, so the semi-amplitude K would be the maximum value. So assuming that the maximum occurs when sin ω = 1, then:\n\nK2 = (2π G / P2)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 + e)/sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nBut for Planet 1, which is circular (e=0), K1 = (2π G / P1)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3))\n\nTherefore, the ratio K1/K2 is:\n\n[ (2π G / P1)^(1/3) / (2π G / P2)^(1/3) ) ] * [ 1 / ((1 + e)/sqrt(1 - e²)) ) ]\n\nSimplifying the first part:\n\n( P2 / P1 )^(1/3)\n\nSo:\n\nK1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) / (1 + e)\n\nWe can solve for P2/P1.\n\nGiven that e = 0.2 for Planet 2 (as calculated earlier), let's compute sqrt(1 - e²) / (1 + e):\n\nsqrt(1 - 0.04) / (1 + 0.2) = sqrt(0.96) / 1.2 ≈ 0.98 / 1.2 ≈ 0.816\n\nSo:\n\nK1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * 0.816\n\nTherefore, (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/(K2 * 0.816)\n\nBut we need to find K1 and K2. However, the problem gives us the wavelength shifts. Assuming that Δλ for Planet 1 is 4 milliAngstroms and Δλ for Planet 2 is 1.77 milliAngstroms (assuming typo), then K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 = 4 / 1.77 ≈ 2.26.\n\nSo:\n\n2.26 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * 0.816\n\nTherefore, (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 2.26 / 0.816 ≈ 2.77\n\nThen, P2/P1 = (2.77)^3 ≈ 21.3\n\nWait, that's way too large compared to the answer choices (which are around 0.2-1.6). Clearly, there's something wrong here. Let me check my steps.\n\nFirst, I assumed that the problem had a typo and Planet 2's wavelength shift is 1.77 milliAngstroms. But if that's the case, then K1/K2 is 4 / 1.77 ≈ 2.26. But according to the calculation, this leads to P2/P1 ≈ 21, which is not in the answer choices. So maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct in stating 1.77 MeV, and I need to interpret that. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nLet me recall that the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. If there's a Doppler shift, the change in wavelength Δλ corresponds to a change in energy ΔE. Let's suppose that the problem is referring to the energy change ΔE for the photon due to the Doppler shift. For Planet 2, this ΔE is given as 1.77 MeV. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nFirst, let's compute the velocity shift corresponding to a given ΔE.\n\nThe energy of the photon is E = hc/λ. After Doppler shift, λ becomes λ + Δλ, so E' = hc/(λ + Δλ). The change in energy ΔE = E - E' = hc/λ - hc/(λ + Δλ) ≈ hc Δλ / λ² (for small Δλ). But Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, so ΔE ≈ hc (v/c) / λ = hv / λ. But since E = hc/λ, then ΔE ≈ v * (E / c). Therefore, ΔE = (v/c) * E.\n\nSo if we have ΔE = (v/c) * E, then v = (ΔE / E) * c.\n\nBut we need to find E for the photon. The problem doesn't specify the energy of the photon, but maybe we can use the same spectral line as for Planet 1. Let's assume that the same spectral line is observed, so E is the same for both planets. Therefore, if for Planet 2, ΔE is 1.77 MeV, then v2 = (1.77 MeV / E) * c.\n\nBut we don't know E. However, for Planet 1, we have Δλ1 = 4 milliAngstroms. Let's relate that to ΔE1. Using ΔE1 = (v1/c) * E, and similarly for Planet 2: ΔE2 = (v2/c) * E. Therefore, the ratio of velocities v1/v2 = ΔE1 / ΔE2.\n\nWait, but we don't know ΔE1 for Planet 1. However, maybe we can express both ΔE1 and ΔE2 in terms of v1 and v2, and then relate them.\n\nFor Planet 1, Δλ1/λ = v1/c → v1 = c * Δλ1/λ.\n\nFor Planet 2, ΔE2 = (v2/c) * E. But E = hc/λ, so:\n\nΔE2 = (v2/c) * (hc/λ) = h v2 / λ.\n\nBut also, ΔE2 can be written as h v2 / λ.\n\nBut for Planet 1, ΔE1 = h v1 / λ.\n\nTherefore, the ratio ΔE2/ΔE1 = v2 / v1.\n\nBut the problem says that for Planet 1, Δλ is 4 milliAngstroms, and for Planet 2, ΔE is 1.77 MeV. So if we can find ΔE1 and ΔE2, then we can find the ratio v2/v1.\n\nBut we need to compute ΔE1 for Planet 1. Let's assume a typical wavelength for the spectral line. Let's say λ is 5000 Angstroms (5 × 10^-7 m). Then, Δλ1 = 4 × 10^-3 Angstroms = 4 × 10^-11 m.\n\nThen, Δλ1/λ = 4 × 10^-11 / 5 × 10^-7 = 8 × 10^-5.\n\nSo v1 = c * 8 × 10^-5 ≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s * 8 × 10^-5 = 2.4 × 10^4 m/s = 24 km/s.\n\nThen, ΔE1 = h v1 / λ.\n\nPlanck's constant h is 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s.\n\nSo ΔE1 = (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s) * (24,000 m/s) / (5 × 10^-7 m) ≈ (6.626 × 24,000 / 5 × 10^-7) × 10^-34 J.\n\nLet me calculate the numerical part:\n\n6.626 × 24,000 ≈ 1.59 × 10^5\n\nDivide by 5 × 10^-7: 1.59 × 10^5 / 5 × 10^-7 ≈ 3.18 × 10^11.\n\nSo ΔE1 ≈ 3.18 × 10^11 × 10^-34 J = 3.18 × 10^-23 J.\n\nConvert to MeV: 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J, so 1 MeV = 1.602 × 10^-13 J.\n\nTherefore, ΔE1 ≈ 3.18 × 10^-23 / 1.602 × 10^-13 ≈ 1.98 × 10^-10 MeV ≈ 0.198 femtoMeV. That's way smaller than 1.77 MeV. This suggests that if the problem is stating that ΔE2 = 1.77 MeV, then v2/v1 is ΔE2/ΔE1 ≈ 1.77 MeV / 0.198 femtoMeV = 1.77 / 0.198 × 10^15 ≈ 8.94 × 10^15, which is impossible. Clearly, this approach is not working.\n\nThis indicates that there's a fundamental problem with interpreting the given data. Perhaps the problem meant to provide the energy shift in a different way, or there's a misunderstanding in the units.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's forget about the wavelength shifts and focus on the given data about the orbital parameters.\n\nBoth planets have the same m sin i, same star mass, same inclination, so same true mass. For Planet 1, circular orbit. For Planet 2, eccentric orbit with e=0.2. We need to find the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³. So if we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes a1 and a2, we can find the ratio of their periods.\n\nBut how to find a1 and a2 from the radial velocity data?\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is related to the semi-major axis and period. For a circular orbit:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3))\n\nFor an eccentric orbit, the formula is more complex. But since both planets have the same m sin i and same M, and same inclination, perhaps we can relate their K values.\n\nLet me denote K1 for Planet 1 and K2 for Planet 2.\n\nFor Planet 1 (circular):\n\nK1 = (2π G / P1)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3)\n\nFor Planet 2 (eccentric):\n\nK2 = (2π G / P2)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * [ (1 + e²/2) / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ] ?\n\nWait, I need the correct formula for K in an eccentric orbit. Let me recall that for an eccentric orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * (1 + e sin ω) / (1 - e²)^(1/2)\n\nBut since ω is the argument of periastron, which is not given, we can't determine the exact value. However, if we assume that the maximum velocity occurs at periapsis, then sin ω = 1, so:\n\nK2 = (2π G / P2)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * (1 + e) / (1 - e²)^(1/2)\n\nSimplify the denominator: 1 - e² = (1 - e)(1 + e), so sqrt(1 - e²) = sqrt(1 - e) * sqrt(1 + e). Therefore:\n\n(1 + e)/sqrt(1 - e²) = (1 + e) / [sqrt(1 - e) * sqrt(1 + e)] ) = sqrt(1 + e)/sqrt(1 - e) = sqrt( (1 + e)/(1 - e) )\n\nBut earlier, we were told that for Planet 2, the ratio of apoapsis to periapsis is 1.5. Apoapsis is a(1 + e), periapsis is a(1 - e). So their ratio is (1 + e)/(1 - e) = 1.5. As we calculated earlier, this gives e = 0.2.\n\nSo (1 + e)/(1 - e) = 1.5, so sqrt(1.5) ≈ 1.2247.\n\nTherefore, the correction factor for K2 is sqrt(1.5).\n\nThus, K2 = K_circular * sqrt(1.5), where K_circular would be the value if the orbit were circular with the same semi-major axis.\n\nBut since both planets have the same m sin i and M, if they had the same semi-major axis, their K values would differ by this factor. However, in reality, they might have different semi-major axes, so we need to relate K1 and K2.\n\nLet me write the ratio of K1 and K2:\n\nK1 / K2 = [ (2π G / P1)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) ] / [ (2π G / P2)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * sqrt(1.5) ) ]\n\nSimplifying:\n\nK1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) / sqrt(1.5)\n\nTherefore:\n\n(P2 / P1)^(1/3) = K1 / (K2 * sqrt(1.5))\n\nThus:\n\nP2 / P1 = [ K1 / (K2 * sqrt(1.5)) ]^3\n\nNow, we need to find K1 and K2 from the given data. But the problem gives the wavelength shifts. For Planet 1, it's 4 milliAngstroms. For Planet 2, it's 1.77 MeV. This is still confusing, but let's try to find a way to relate these.\n\nLet's assume that the wavelength shift Δλ for Planet 1 is related to K1 via Δλ/λ = K1/c. Similarly, for Planet 2, if we could find Δλ2, then Δλ2/λ = K2/c. But the problem gives Δλ1 and ΔE2. Let's try to relate ΔE2 to K2.\n\nAssuming that the energy shift ΔE is related to the velocity K2. As earlier, ΔE = (K2/c) * E, where E is the energy of the photon. If we can express E in terms of Δλ1 and K1, then we can find the ratio.\n\nFor Planet 1: Δλ1/λ = K1/c → K1 = c * Δλ1/λ.\n\nFor Planet 2: ΔE2 = (K2/c) * E.\n\nBut E = hc/λ, so ΔE2 = (K2/c) * (hc/λ) = h K2 / λ.\n\nFrom Planet 1, we have K1 = c Δλ1 / λ → λ = c Δλ1 / K1.\n\nSubstitute into ΔE2:\n\nΔE2 = h K2 / (c Δλ1 / K1) ) = h K1 K2 / (c Δλ1)\n\nBut we need to find K1 and K2. However, we have two variables here. But we also have the relation from above:\n\nP2/P1 = [ K1 / (K2 * sqrt(1.5)) ]^3\n\nAnd from Kepler's third law, since P² ∝ a³, and from the radial velocity data, we can relate a to K and P.\n\nBut this seems too abstract. Let's try to find numerical values.\n\nLet me assume that the problem has a typo and that the energy for Planet 2 is actually a wavelength shift of 1.77 milliAngstroms. Then, K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 = 4/1.77 ≈ 2.26. Then, using the earlier relation:\n\nP2/P1 = [ K1 / (K2 * sqrt(1.5)) ]^3 = [ 2.26 / sqrt(1.5) ]^3 ≈ [ 2.26 / 1.2247 ]^3 ≈ (1.845)^3 ≈ 6.3. But this is still not in the answer choices. The answer choices are ~0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 1.6. So this suggests that my assumption is still wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the energy shift for Planet 2 is 1.77 milliAngstroms, but I misread it as MeV. Let's try that. If Δλ2 = 1.77 milliAngstroms, then K1/K2 = 4 / 1.77 ≈ 2.26. Then, P2/P1 = [2.26 / sqrt(1.5)]^3 ≈ 6.3, which is still not in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy is related to the velocity in a different way. For example, if the problem is referring to the kinetic energy of the star's motion, then K is the velocity. The kinetic energy would be (1/2) M K². But the problem says \"the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host star of planet #2 corresponds to 1.77 MeV.\" So perhaps the energy here is the kinetic energy of the star's motion? Let's explore this.\n\nIf the kinetic energy of the star is 1.77 MeV, then (1/2) M K2² = 1.77 MeV. But the star has a mass similar to the Sun, which is about 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Let's compute K2 from this.\n\nFirst, convert 1.77 MeV to joules: 1.77 MeV = 1.77 × 10^6 eV × 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV ≈ 2.836 × 10^-13 J.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/2) * 1.989 × 10^30 kg * K2² = 2.836 × 10^-13 J\n\nSolving for K2:\n\nK2² = (2 * 2.836 × 10^-13 J) / (1.989 × 10^30 kg) ≈ 2.856 × 10^-13 / 1.989 × 10^30 ≈ 1.436 × 10^-43\n\nK2 ≈ sqrt(1.436 × 10^-43) ≈ 1.198 × 10^-21 m/s\n\nThis is an extremely small velocity, which doesn't make sense for a detectable radial velocity signal. The typical radial velocity amplitudes for Neptune-mass planets are on the order of meters per second, not 10^-21 m/s. This suggests that interpreting the energy as kinetic energy is incorrect.\n\nGiven all these dead ends, I must conclude that there is likely a typo in the problem statement, and the intended value for Planet 2's wavelength shift is 1.77 milliAngstroms. Let's proceed with that assumption, even though the calculation doesn't give a matching answer choice, to see if there's another error in my reasoning.\n\nSo, assuming Δλ2 = 1.77 milliAngstroms, K1/K2 = 4/1.77 ≈ 2.26. The correction factor for Planet 2's eccentric orbit is sqrt(1.5) ≈ 1.2247. So the ratio P2/P1 = [K1/(K2 * 1.2247)]^3 = [2.26 / 1.2247]^3 ≈ (1.845)^3 ≈ 6.3. This is still not in the answer choices, which are around 0.2-1.6. This suggests that my approach is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the correction factor wrong. Let me re-examine the formula for K in an eccentric orbit. Earlier, I said that for the maximum velocity, K2 = K_circular * sqrt(1.5). But let me derive this again.\n\nFor an eccentric orbit, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * (1 + e sin ω) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nIf we assume that the maximum velocity occurs when sin ω = 1 (i.e., the planet is at periapsis when the velocity is maximum), then:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * (1 + e) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nBut for the circular orbit (e=0), K_circular = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3)\n\nSo the ratio K / K_circular = (1 + e) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nWith e=0.2, this is (1.2)/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.2/0.98 ≈ 1.2247, which is what I had before.\n\nBut if instead, the semi-amplitude K is defined differently, perhaps I should consider that for an eccentric orbit, the semi-amplitude is actually K = K_circular * sqrt( (1 + e²)/ (1 - e²) ) or something else. Let me check.\n\nActually, according to standard references, the correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * (1 + e²/2) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nWait, this is different from what I had before. Let me verify.\n\nThe correct formula for K, assuming that the argument of periastron ω is 90 degrees (which maximizes the term), is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * (1 + e sin ω) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nBut if ω is such that sin ω = 0, then it's just 1 / sqrt(1 - e²). The average value might be different, but since the problem doesn't specify ω, perhaps we should use the standard formula that assumes ω=90°, giving (1 + e²/2)/sqrt(1 - e²). Wait, I need to recall the correct expression.\n\nActually, the correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, assuming that the maximum velocity is measured, and taking into account the orbital eccentricity, is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * (1 + e²/2) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me refer to a textbook formula. According to the textbook \"Exoplanets\" by Seager, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * (1 + e²/2)^(1/3) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Let me look up the formula for K in an eccentric orbit. According\n\n to the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * (1 + e sin ω) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nBut since ω is unknown, it's often assumed to be zero, giving:\n\nK = (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / (M^(1/3)) * 1 / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nThis is the standard formula when the argument of periastron is not specified. Therefore, the correction factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - e²).\n\nWait, but this would mean that for an eccentric orbit, the semi-amplitude K is higher by a factor of 1 / sqrt(1 - e²) compared to a circular orbit. For e=0.2, this factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206. This is a small correction, not the 1.2247 I had before. This changes things!\n\nSo, let's redo the calculation with this correction factor.\n\nFor Planet 1 (circular, e=0):\n\nK1 = (2π G / P1)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3)\n\nFor Planet 2 (eccentric, e=0.2):\n\nK2 = (2π G / P2)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3) * 1 / sqrt(1 - e²) ≈ K_circular * 1.0206\n\nWhere K_circular would be the value if the orbit were circular with the same semi-major axis.\n\nTherefore, the ratio K1/K2 is:\n\n[ (2π G / P1)^(1/3) / (2π G / P2)^(1/3) ) ] * sqrt(1 - e²) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nThus:\n\nK1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nSolving for P2/P1:\n\n(P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/(K2 * sqrt(1 - e²))\n\nP2/P1 = [ K1/(K2 * sqrt(1 - e²)) ]^3\n\nNow, with e=0.2, sqrt(1 - e²) = sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98.\n\nAssuming that the problem meant Δλ2 = 1.77 milliAngstroms, then K1/K2 = 4/1.77 ≈ 2.26. Then:\n\nP2/P1 = [2.26 / (1.77 * 0.98)]^3 ≈ [2.26 / (1.7346)]^3 ≈ (1.303)^3 ≈ 2.22\n\nBut this is still not in the answer choices. However, if the actual K1/K2 is different, let's see.\n\nWait, if the problem's 1.77 MeV is actually a velocity in some unit, let's try to convert it. Let's assume that the problem meant 1.77 km/s, which is a typical unit for radial velocity amplitudes. If 1.77 MeV is a typo and should be 1.77 km/s, then let's see.\n\nAssuming that for Planet 2, K2 = 1.77 km/s, and for Planet 1, K1 = 4 milliAngstroms. Let's find K1 in terms of velocity.\n\nFor Planet 1, Δλ = 4 milliAngstroms. Let's assume a wavelength λ = 5000 Angstroms (5 × 10^-7 m). Then, Δλ/λ = 4 × 10^-3 / 5000 = 8 × 10^-7. Thus, K1 = c * Δλ/λ ≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s * 8 × 10^-7 = 24 m/s = 0.024 km/s.\n\nSo K1 = 0.024 km/s, K2 = 1.77 km/s. Thus, K1/K2 = 0.024 / 1.77 ≈ 0.0135.\n\nNow, using the corrected formula:\n\nP2/P1 = [ K1/(K2 * sqrt(1 - e²)) ]^3 = [0.0135 / (1.77 * 0.98)]^3 ≈ [0.0135 / 1.7346]^3 ≈ (0.00778)^3 ≈ 4.7 × 10^-7, which is way too small. This also doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption about the typo is still incorrect. Let me try another angle. Let's forget the wavelength shifts and focus on the semi-major axis and period.\n\nSince both planets have the same m sin i and same star mass, and same inclination, their true masses are the same. For Planet 1, circular orbit, so a1 is determined by Kepler's law. For Planet 2, with eccentricity e=0.2, the semi-major axis a2 is related to the period via Kepler's third law as well. The semi-major axis is the same as for a circular orbit with the same period. Wait, no. The semi-major axis is a single value for the orbit, regardless of eccentricity. So if we can find the semi-major axes from the radial velocity data, we can find the periods.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude K is related to the semi-major axis a1 by:\n\nK1 = (2π G / P1)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3)\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P1² = (4π² / G(M + m)) a1³ ≈ (4π² / G M) a1³, since m << M.\n\nSolving for a1:\n\na1³ = (G M P1²) / (4π²)\n\nSubstituting into the expression for K1:\n\nK1 = (2π G / P1)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / M^(1/3)\n\nLet me cube both sides:\n\nK1³ = (8π³ G³ / P1³) * (m sin i)³ / M\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P1³ = (4π² / G M) a1³ * P1\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me use dimensional analysis or find a relation between K and a.\n\nAlternatively, since both planets have the same m sin i and M, and same inclination, their true masses are the same. For Planet 1, with circular orbit, the semi-major axis a1 can be found from the radial velocity data. For Planet 2, with semi-major axis a2, the radial velocity data gives K2, which is related to a2 and e.\n\nBut without knowing the actual values of K1 and K2, I'm stuck. Given the confusion about the units, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the given data in a different way.\n\nWait, let's recall that for the RV method, the amplitude K is proportional to (m sin i)/M^(1/3) * (a/P)^(1/3). But since a = (G M P²/(4π²))^(1/3), this is circular.\n\nAlternatively, for a circular orbit, K1 is proportional to (m sin i)/a^(1/2), because K1 ∝ (m sin i)/a^(1/2). Let me derive this.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P² = (4π²/GM) a³ → P = sqrt(4π² a³ / (GM)).\n\nThe velocity of the star is K1 = 2π a_star / P, where a_star is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit: a_star = (m/M) a.\n\nSo K1 = 2π (m/M) a / P = 2π (m/M) a / sqrt(4π² a³ / (GM)) = 2π (m/M) a / (2π a^(3/2) / sqrt(GM)) ) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a) * something.\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step:\n\nK1 = 2π (m/M) a / P\n\nP = sqrt(4π² a³ / (GM)) = 2π a^(3/2) / sqrt(GM)\n\nThus, K1 = 2π (m/M) a / [2π a^(3/2) / sqrt(GM)] ) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a) * a / a^(3/2) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a) * a^(-1/2) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a) * 1/sqrt(a) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a³) * a = ... Wait, this is getting messy. Let me simplify:\n\nK1 = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a) * 1/sqrt(a) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM) / a\n\nWait, no, let's do it properly:\n\nK1 = 2π (m/M) a / P\n\nP = 2π a^(3/2) / sqrt(GM)\n\nSo K1 = 2π (m/M) a / [2π a^(3/2) / sqrt(GM)] ) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM) * a / a^(3/2) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM) / a^(1/2) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a)\n\nThus, K1 = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a) = m sqrt(GM) / (M sqrt(a)) = (m/M) * sqrt(GM/a)\n\nBut since m is the planet's mass, and M is the star's mass, and assuming M >> m, this simplifies to K1 ∝ m / sqrt(a). Thus, K1 is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis.\n\nFor Planet 1, K1 ∝ 1/sqrt(a1)\n\nFor Planet 2, with eccentricity e, the semi-amplitude K2 is related to a2 and e. For an eccentric orbit, the formula is K2 ∝ (1 + e²/2)/sqrt(1 - e²) * 1/sqrt(a2). But I'm not sure about the exact proportionality. Let's assume that the correction factor is 1/sqrt(1 - e²), as per the earlier formula.\n\nThus, K2 ∝ 1/(sqrt(1 - e²) * sqrt(a2))\n\nGiven that, and since both planets have the same m sin i and M, we can write:\n\nK1 / K2 = [1/sqrt(a1)] / [1/(sqrt(1 - e²) * sqrt(a2))] = sqrt(1 - e²) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nThus, K1/K2 = sqrt(1 - e²) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nSolving for a2/a1:\n\na2/a1 = (K1/(K2 * sqrt(1 - e²)))^2\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2) = [ (K1/(K2 * sqrt(1 - e²)))^2 ]^(3/2) = (K1/(K2 * sqrt(1 - e²)))^3\n\nThis is the same as the earlier relation: P2/P1 = [ K1/(K2 * sqrt(1 - e²)) ]^3\n\nNow, if we can find K1 and K2, we can compute this.\n\nBut the problem gives us the wavelength shifts. For Planet 1, Δλ1 = 4 milliAngstroms. For Planet 2, Δλ2 is given as 1.77 MeV, which is likely a typo. Let's assume that it should be 1.77 milliAngstroms. Then, K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 = 4/1.77 ≈ 2.26. With e=0.2, sqrt(1 - e²) = 0.98.\n\nThus, P2/P1 = (2.26 / (1.77 * 0.98))^3 ≈ (2.26 / 1.7346)^3 ≈ (1.303)^3 ≈ 2.22. This is still not in the answer choices, but let's check if there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, if the problem meant that the wavelength shift for Planet 2 is 1.77 times larger than for Planet 1, but that would be 4 * 1.77 = 7.08 milliAngstroms, which would give K1/K2 = 4/7.08 ≈ 0.565. Then, P2/P1 = (0.565 / 0.98)^3 ≈ (0.576)^3 ≈ 0.19, which is close to answer B: ~0.2. This is possible if there was a misinterpretation of the problem's numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant that the energy corresponds to a velocity, and there's a conversion error, let's try to think differently. Let's say that the 1.77 MeV is actually a velocity in some unit, like 1.77 km/s. Let's assume that for Planet 2, K2 = 1.77 km/s, and for Planet 1, K1 = 4 milliAngstroms. Let's convert K1 to velocity.\n\nAssuming λ = 5000 Angstroms, Δλ = 4 milliAngstroms = 4 × 10^-3 Angstroms = 4 × 10^-11 m. λ = 5000 Angstroms = 5 × 10^-7 m. Then, Δλ/λ = 4 × 10^-11 / 5 × 10^-7 = 8 × 10^-5. Thus, K1 = c * Δλ/λ = 3 × 10^8 m/s * 8 × 10^-5 = 2.4 × 10^4 m/s = 24 km/s.\n\nIf K2 = 1.77 km/s, then K1/K2 = 24 / 1.77 ≈ 13.56. Then, P2/P1 = (13.56 / (1.77 * 0.98))^3 ≈ (13.56 / 1.7346)^3 ≈ (7.82)^3 ≈ 477, which is way too large.\n\nThis is not helpful. Given the confusion, and the answer choices being around 0.2-1.6, and the previous calculation giving P2/P1 ≈ 0.19 if K1/K2 = 0.565, which would happen if the problem meant that the wavelength shift for Planet 2 is 7.08 milliAngstroms, but the problem says 1.77 MeV, perhaps the correct approach is to use the given data in a different way.\n\nLet me try to think about the energy in another context. If the problem is referring to the energy of the star's motion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the 1.77 MeV is a redshift in energy, and we can use the relation between energy and velocity.\n\nThe energy of the photon is E = hc/λ. After Doppler shift, the energy becomes E' = hc/(λ + Δλ). The ratio E/E' = (λ + Δλ)/λ = 1 + Δλ/λ. If we assume that the energy shift is ΔE = E - E' = E - E'(1 + Δλ/λ), but this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is referring to the relativistic Doppler shift, where the energy shift is related to the velocity. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:\n\nE' = E * sqrt((1 - β)/(1 + β)), where β = v/c.\n\nBut this is for a source moving away. If we have a periodic shift, it would be ±β. But this is getting too complex, and I don't see how to extract a numerical value from this.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the previous calculation where P2/P1 ≈ 0.19, which is close to answer B: ~0.2. This would happen if the K1/K2 is 0.565, which would occur if the wavelength shift for Planet 2 is larger than for Planet 1, implying a smaller K2, hence a larger period. Wait, no: if K2 is larger, then P2 would be smaller. Wait, the relation is P2/P1 = [K1/(K2 * ...)]^3. If K2 is larger, P2 is smaller. If K2 is smaller, P2 is larger.\n\nIf the problem's 1.77 MeV is a larger value, implying a larger K2, then P2 would be smaller. But the answer choices include 0.2, which is smaller, and 1.6, which is larger. Given that the answer choices are provided, and my earlier calculation with a typo assumption gave P2/P1 ≈ 0.19, which is close to 0.2, I'll go with answer B: ~0.2.\n</think>"}
