Relative Speed in Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is simply the difference of their speeds. However, in **special relativity**, when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, the correct formula for the relative speed $ v_{\\text{rel}} $ is given by the **relativistic velocity subtraction**:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{u - v}{1 - \\frac{uv}{c^2}}\n$$\n\nHere:\n- $ u = 0.6c $: velocity of the 2m astronaut,\n- $ v = 0.5c $: velocity of the 3m astronaut.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.1429c\n$$\n\nThus, the **relative speed** is approximately $ 0.14c $.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

So, there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what relative speed means in special relativity. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them classically. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but here both are moving in the same direction. So, if we want the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other, how does that work?\n\nLet me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. If I want the speed of A relative to B, or vice versa? The question says \"relative speed,\" which is a scalar, so maybe it's just the magnitude of the difference? But in relativity, the formula isn't straightforward.\n\nThe relativistic formula for relative velocity is: if an object is moving at velocity u in one frame, and another frame is moving at velocity v relative to the first, then the velocity of the object in the second frame is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So, if we want the speed of astronaut A (0.6c) relative to astronaut B (0.5c), we can plug into this formula.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's take astronaut B's frame as the rest frame, so we want to find the velocity of astronaut A in that frame. So u is 0.6c (velocity of A in original frame), and v is 0.5c (velocity of B's frame relative to original frame). Therefore, the velocity of A in B's frame is:\n\nu' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²) = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c ≈ 0.143c. \n\nSo approximately 0.14c. Let me check the options. Option B and C have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's promising. The other options have 0.1c or 1.1c. 1.1c is faster than light, which isn't possible, so D is out. A has 0.1c which is the classical answer, so probably not. So relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So between B and C.\n\nNow for the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = γmc², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).\n\nSo for each astronaut, we need to compute γ and multiply by their mass and c², then add them together.\n\nFirst astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Let's compute γ1.\n\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nSo E1 = γ1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c²\n\nSecond astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.\n\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547\n\nSo E2 = γ2 * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c²\n\nTotal energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².\n\nLooking at the options: B says E=5.96 mc² and C says E=5 mc². So B is the one with 5.96. Therefore, the answer should be B: v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc².\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"total energy of the system\". Is there a possibility that the total energy is not just the sum of their individual energies? In special relativity, energy is also dependent on the reference frame. But the question doesn't specify the reference frame for the total energy. Usually, unless specified, it's in the original frame where their velocities are given (the lab frame). So adding their energies in that frame is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if they meant the total energy in the center of mass frame or something else, but the problem doesn't specify. Since the velocities are given in the same frame (presumably the same initial frame), adding their energies in that frame is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², matching option B.\n\nLet me just check my calculations again.\n\nFor γ1: velocity 0.6c. 0.6 squared is 0.36, 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so 1/0.8=1.25. Correct. Then 1.25 * 2m c² is 2.5 mc². Correct.\n\nFor γ2: velocity 0.5c. 0.5 squared is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approx 0.866. 1/0.866 is approx 1.1547. Multiply by 3m c²: 1.1547 * 3 ≈ 3.464 mc². Adding to 2.5 gives 5.964 mc². Yes, so 5.96 is correct. So option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
