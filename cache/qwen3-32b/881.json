The problem gives me the energy per second, which is 4 × 10²⁶ J, and I need to use Einstein's mass-energy equation. Hmm, Einstein's equation is E = mc², right? So if I rearrange that to solve for mass, it should be m = E / c². Let me write that down.\n\nFirst, let me recall the value of the speed of light, c. It's approximately 3 × 10⁸ meters per second. So c squared would be (3 × 10⁸)². Let me calculate that. 3 squared is 9, and 10⁸ squared is 10¹⁶, so c² is 9 × 10¹⁶ m²/s².\n\nNow, the energy per second is given as 4 × 10²⁶ J. Plugging into the equation m = E / c², that would be m = (4 × 10²⁶ J) / (9 × 10¹⁶ m²/s²). Let me compute that.\n\nDividing 4 by 9 gives approximately 0.444... So 0.444... × 10^(26-16) = 0.444... × 10¹⁰ kg. Which is 4.44... × 10⁹ kg. So approximately 4.4 × 10⁹ kg per second.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 10⁹ kg. The calculated value is about 4.4 × 10⁹, which is closest to 10⁹ kg. The other options are way off. A is 10³⁶, which is way too big. B is 10¹⁸, still way larger than our result. C is 10¹³, which is 10,000 times smaller than our answer. D is 10⁹, which is in the same ballpark, just a factor of 4 difference. Since the question asks for the closest value, D must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made an error in exponents. Let me redo the division:\n\nE = 4e26 J, c² = 9e16 m²/s². So m = 4e26 / 9e16 = (4/9) * 10^(26-16) = 0.444... * 10^10 = 4.44... × 10^9 kg. Yep, that's correct. So approximately 4.4 × 10⁹ kg per second. So the closest order of magnitude is 10⁹ kg, so option D. \n\nI think that's right. The options don't have a 4 × 10⁹, so the closest is 10⁹. So answer D.\n</think>"}
