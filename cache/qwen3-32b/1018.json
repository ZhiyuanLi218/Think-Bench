Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about voltaic cells and cell potential.\n\nFirst, I remember that the cell potential (E_cell) is determined by the standard electrode potentials of the two half-reactions, adjusted by the concentrations of the ions involved, which is governed by the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q), where Q is the reaction quotient. At standard conditions, Q is 1, so E = E°. But when concentrations change, the cell potential changes accordingly.\n\nLooking at the given reaction: 2Ag+ + Fe → 2Ag + Fe²+. This is a redox reaction. Let me break it down into oxidation and reduction half-reactions.\n\nOxidation (loss of electrons) occurs at the anode. Reduction (gain of electrons) occurs at the cathode. In this reaction, Fe(s) is being oxidized to Fe²+ because it's going from elemental form (0 oxidation state) to +2. So Fe is the reducing agent here. The silver ions (Ag+) are being reduced to Ag(s), going from +1 to 0. So Ag+ is the oxidizing agent.\n\nThe standard cell potential E°cell can be calculated by E°cathode (reduction) - E°anode (oxidation). I might need the standard reduction potentials for these half-reactions. Let me recall them.\n\nThe standard reduction potential for Ag+ + e⁻ → Ag(s) is about +0.80 V. For Fe²+ + 2e⁻ → Fe(s), the standard reduction potential is around -0.44 V. However, since Fe is being oxidized (from Fe(s) to Fe²+), we need to reverse that reaction. So the oxidation potential would be the negative of the reduction potential, which is +0.44 V.\n\nTherefore, the standard cell potential E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode. Wait, but the anode here is Fe being oxidized, so the anode's potential is the oxidation potential. So E°cell = E°cathode (Ag+/Ag) + E°anode (oxidation of Fe). Wait, no, the formula is E°cell = E°cathode (reduction) - E°anode (reduction). Since the anode is undergoing oxidation, its potential as a reduction is subtracted. Let me check:\n\nE°cell = E°cathode (Ag+/Ag) - E°anode (Fe²+/Fe). So that's 0.80 V - (-0.44 V) = 0.80 + 0.44 = 1.24 V. So the standard cell potential is 1.24 V.\n\nBut the question is not about standard conditions. It's about changing concentrations or amounts of reactants/products to see how the cell potential changes.\n\nThe options are about changing [Fe²+], adding Fe(s), etc. Let's go through each option.\n\nThe Nernst equation for this reaction would be E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q). Q is [Fe²+]/[Ag+]^2 because the reaction is 2Ag+ + Fe → 2Ag + Fe²+. Wait, Fe is a solid, so it doesn't appear in the reaction quotient. So Q = [Fe²+]/[Ag+]^2.\n\nSo the reaction quotient Q is [Fe²+]/[Ag+]^2. The cell potential E depends on how Q compares to the equilibrium constant K. If Q is less than K, the reaction will proceed forward, and the cell potential will be higher than E°. If Q is greater than K, the reaction will proceed in reverse, and the cell potential will be lower than E°.\n\nBut since the question is about increasing the potential, we need to see which change would make E increase. Let's think about how each option affects Q and thus E.\n\nFirst, let's write the Nernst equation for this specific reaction. At 25°C, the equation can be approximated as E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q), where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred. In this reaction, how many electrons are transferred?\n\nLooking at the oxidation half-reaction: Fe → Fe²+ + 2e⁻. Reduction half-reaction: 2Ag+ + 2e⁻ → 2Ag. So total electrons transferred is 2. Therefore, n = 2.\n\nSo E = E° - (0.0592/2) * log([Fe²+]/[Ag+]²)\n\nTherefore, to increase E, we need to decrease the value of log([Fe²+]/[Ag+]²), because that term is subtracted. So if log(Q) is smaller (more negative), then subtracting a smaller (more negative) number would result in a larger E.\n\nAlternatively, if Q is smaller, then log(Q) is more negative, so - (something negative) becomes positive, increasing E. So if we can decrease Q, then E increases. How can we decrease Q?\n\nQ = [Fe²+]/[Ag+]². To decrease Q, we can either decrease [Fe²+] or increase [Ag+]. Because if [Fe²+] decreases, the numerator gets smaller, making Q smaller. If [Ag+] increases, the denominator gets larger, making Q smaller.\n\nSo if we can do either of those, Q decreases, log(Q) becomes more negative, so the term -(0.0592/2)*log(Q) becomes positive, leading to higher E.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\nA: Increasing [Fe²+]. That would increase Q, making log(Q) more positive. Then the term subtracted becomes larger, so E decreases. Therefore, A would decrease the potential.\n\nB: Adding more Fe(s). Since Fe is a solid, its concentration/activity is considered 1 and doesn't appear in Q. So adding more Fe(s) doesn't affect Q. Therefore, E remains the same. So B would not change the potential.\n\nC: Decreasing [Fe²+]. This would decrease Q, leading to a lower log(Q), making the subtracted term smaller (or more negative), so E increases. Therefore, C would increase the potential.\n\nD: Removing some Fe(s). Again, since Fe is a solid, its amount doesn't affect the reaction quotient. So removing some Fe(s) doesn't change Q. Therefore, D would not change the potential.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: Decreasing [Fe²+].\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me re-express the Nernst equation:\n\nE = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q). For the reaction 2Ag+ + Fe → 2Ag + Fe²+, Q = [Fe²+]/[Ag+]². So if we decrease [Fe²+], Q decreases. Let's say Q becomes smaller. Then log(Q) becomes more negative. Let's take an example. Suppose originally Q was 1, then log(Q) is 0, so E = E°. If we decrease [Fe²+], Q becomes less than 1, say 0.1. Then log(0.1) = -1. Then the term becomes - (0.0592/2)*(-1) = + (0.0592/2), which adds to E°, making E higher. So yes, decreasing [Fe²+] increases the cell potential. So C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we increase [Ag+], that would also decrease Q because [Ag+] is in the denominator. But the options don't mention changing [Ag+], so we don't need to consider that here.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, C is the correct one. Let me check the other options again to be sure.\n\nOption A: Increasing [Fe²+] would increase Q, leading to a more positive log(Q), so the term subtracted becomes larger, making E smaller. So A would decrease potential, not increase.\n\nOption B: Adding Fe(s) doesn't affect Q. So E remains same. Similarly, D: removing Fe(s) also doesn't affect Q. So B and D don't change potential.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n</think>"}
