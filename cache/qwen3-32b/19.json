The disk has a radius of 0.1 meters, starts from rest, and has an angular acceleration of 2.0 rad/s². The time given is 4.0 seconds. The options are A through D. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since the disk is rotating with angular acceleration, I remember that angular motion equations are similar to linear motion equations. The key here is probably to find the angular displacement first and then convert that to linear distance using the radius.\n\nThe disk starts from rest, so initial angular velocity ω₀ is 0. The angular acceleration α is given as 2.0 rad/s², and the time t is 4.0 seconds. I need to find the angular displacement θ. The formula for angular displacement when starting from rest is θ = ½ α t². Let me check that formula. Yes, similar to linear displacement s = ½ a t² when initial velocity is zero.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: θ = 0.5 * 2.0 rad/s² * (4.0 s)². Let me compute that step by step. First, 4.0 squared is 16. Then multiply by 2.0: 2.0 * 16 = 32. Then multiply by 0.5: 0.5 * 32 = 16 radians. So the angular displacement is 16 radians.\n\nNow, to find the linear distance traveled by a point on the rim, I need to multiply the angular displacement by the radius of the disk. The formula is s = rθ. The radius is 0.1 meters. So s = 0.1 m * 16 rad. Let me calculate that: 0.1 * 16 = 1.6 meters. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Angular displacement times radius gives the arc length, which is the distance traveled along the circumference, right? Yes, that's correct. So if the disk rotates 16 radians, a point on the rim would travel 16 times the radius in linear distance. \n\nSo 16 * 0.1 = 1.6 meters. Looking at the options, D is 1.6 m. So the answer should be D. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAngular acceleration α = 2.0 rad/s². Time t = 4.0 s. θ = ½ * 2.0 * (4.0)^2. Yes, ½ * 2.0 is 1.0, and 4 squared is 16, so θ = 16 rad. Multiply by radius 0.1 m: 16 * 0.1 = 1.6 m. Yep, that seems right. \n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by finding the angular velocity at each instant and integrating? But since the acceleration is constant, the standard kinematic equations should suffice. I think my approach is solid. So the answer is D:1.6 m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
