So, the problem is about an alien civilization from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) traveling to Earth at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifespan is 150 solar years. The question is asking how long the trip will take from the astronaut's point of view, and whether they'll live to see Earth.\n\nFirst, I need to remember some physics concepts here. This seems like a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. Because when objects move at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time and space measurements change depending on the observer's frame of reference.\n\nSo, the key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut (the time that would be measured on their own clock) compared to the time measured by an observer on Earth or in the LMC. Also, the distance between the LMC and Earth is important. I think the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away from the Milky Way, but maybe the exact number isn't given here. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance. Hmm, maybe I need to look that up or perhaps it's a standard value used in such problems. Let me check my memory. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. But maybe the problem is using a different value. Wait, the problem might not give the distance, but perhaps it's implied that we need to use the actual distance? Or maybe there's a trick here.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. That's extremely close to the speed of light. The given speed is 0.99999987c, which is c minus a tiny fraction. Let me compute that. Let me write the speed as v = 0.99999987c. To find the gamma factor (Lorentz factor), which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is so close to c, the denominator will be very small, making gamma very large.\n\nFirst, let me calculate 1 - v²/c². Since v is 0.99999987c, v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. Let me denote x = 0.99999987. Then x² = (1 - 1.3*10^-6)^2? Wait, maybe I need to compute 1 - x². Let me do that step by step.\n\nLet me compute v/c = 0.99999987. Let me write that as 1 - 1.3*10^-6. Wait, let me check. Let me compute 1 - 0.99999987. That's 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So, 1.3 x 10^-7. So, v = c(1 - 1.3e-7). Therefore, v²/c² = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. The square term is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. Therefore, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. Therefore, gamma is 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me convert 2.6e-7 to decimal. sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 1e-3 * 0.316 ≈ 3.16e-4. So, multiplying 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is approximately 2000. That's a rough estimate.\n\nBut let me check again. Let me compute 1 - v²/c² more accurately. Let me compute v = 0.99999987c. So, v/c is 0.99999987. Let me square that:\n\n(0.99999987)^2 = ?\n\nLet me use the formula (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b² where a = 1, b = 1.3e-7. Wait, no. Wait, actually, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So, squaring it gives 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. So, 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14. So, 1 - v²/c² is 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈ 2.6e-7. So, the previous calculation holds. Therefore, gamma is 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's take the square root of 2.6e-7.\n\nFirst, sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.612 * 1e-3.5 ≈ 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. Therefore, 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma ≈ 2000. So, the Lorentz factor is approximately 2000.\n\nNow, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is the Earth's frame time divided by gamma. Wait, no. Wait, from the Earth's frame, the distance is D, and the time is t = D / v. From the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted by a factor of gamma, so the distance is D / gamma. Therefore, the time experienced by the astronaut is (D / gamma) / v = D / (v gamma). Alternatively, using time dilation: in the Earth's frame, the time is t = D / v, and the proper time is t / gamma. So, proper time τ = t / gamma = D / (v gamma).\n\nBut I need the distance D. The problem mentions the Large Magellanic Cloud as the starting point. The distance from Earth to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years. But maybe in the problem, they use a different value? Wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance. Wait, but maybe the answer is independent of the actual distance because of the way the question is phrased? Wait, but no, the answer would depend on the distance. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the distance is such that when you compute the proper time, it's one of the given options. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft... having Earth as their destination\". So the distance between the LMC and Earth is needed. Let me recall that the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me take that as 1.63 x 10^5 light-years. Let's use that value.\n\nSo D = 1.63 x 10^5 light-years.\n\nIn the Earth's frame, the time taken is t = D / v. Since v is 0.99999987c, which is very close to c. So t ≈ D / c = 1.63 x 10^5 years. Because if you're moving at nearly the speed of light, the time is approximately the distance in light-years. So t ≈ 163,000 years. But in the astronaut's frame, the time is τ = t / gamma ≈ 163,000 / 2000 ≈ 81.5 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81.5 years of travel. Given that the astronaut is 22 years old, and their lifespan is 150 years, they would live to see Earth, as 22 + 81.5 = 103.5 years, which is less than 150. Therefore, the answer would be A:81 years. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:81, C:72, D:77. Wait, maybe my estimate of the distance is off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses a different distance. Maybe the problem is using the distance in a different unit or a different value? For example, maybe the problem is using the distance as 160,000 light-years? Let me recalculate with D = 1.6 x 10^5 light-years.\n\nt ≈ 1.6e5 years. τ ≈ 1.6e5 / 2000 = 80 years. So that would align with option A:81 years. So that's probably the answer. But let me check if my calculation of gamma is accurate.\n\nEarlier, I approximated gamma as 2000. Let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1 - v²/c² again. v = 0.99999987c. Let me compute v/c = 0.99999987. Let me compute (v/c)^2:\n\nLet me write it as (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7. Therefore, 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2.6e-7. Then sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Let me compute sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.612. 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 1e-3 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-4. Therefore, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. Therefore, gamma = 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is approximately 1964. Therefore, if D is 1.63e5 light-years, then τ = t / gamma = (1.63e5) / 1964 ≈ let's compute that.\n\n1.63e5 divided by 1964. Let me compute 1.63e5 / 2000 = 81.5. Since 1964 is slightly less than 2000, the actual value would be slightly higher than 81.5. Let me compute 1.63e5 / 1964.\n\nFirst, 1.63e5 = 163,000.\n\nDivide 163,000 by 1964:\n\nLet me approximate 1964 ≈ 2000 - 36. So, 163,000 / 1964 ≈ 163,000 / 2000 * (1 + 36/2000) ≈ 81.5 * 1.018 ≈ 81.5 + 81.5*0.018 ≈ 81.5 + 1.467 ≈ 82.97 years. Hmm, so approximately 83 years. But the options are 81, 72, 77. So maybe my distance assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance is different. Let me check the actual distance between the LMC and Earth. According to sources, the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. But perhaps the problem uses a different value, maybe 160,000? Let me recalculate with D = 160,000 light-years.\n\nThen τ = 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 160,000 / 2000 = 80, but adjusted for 1964. So same as before, 80 * (2000/1964) ≈ 80 * 1.018 ≈ 81.4 years. Still around 81.4, which would be option A:81. But the options include A:81 and D:77. Maybe the problem uses a different distance? Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma?\n\nWait, let me check the exact value of v. The problem states the speed is 0.99999987c. Let me compute 1 - v/c = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013 = 1.3e-7. So, v/c = 1 - 1.3e-7. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c) - (1 - v/c)^2) ≈ ?\n\nWait, actually, when v is very close to c, we can use the approximation. Let me use the binomial expansion for gamma when v ≈ c.\n\nLet me set β = v/c = 1 - ε, where ε is small (ε = 1.3e-7). Then,\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (1 - ε)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 1 + 2ε - ε²) = 1 / sqrt(2ε - ε²) ≈ 1 / sqrt(2ε), since ε² is negligible.\n\nSo, gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2ε). Here, ε = 1.3e-7. Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2 * 1.3e-7) = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ same as before. sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, so gamma ≈ 1961. So that's consistent with previous calculation.\n\nSo gamma ≈ 1961. Therefore, if the distance is D = 1.63e5 light-years, then τ = D / (v gamma). Wait, earlier I thought τ = t / gamma where t = D / v. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, in the Earth frame, the time is t = D / v. The proper time is τ = t / gamma. So τ = (D / v) / gamma = D / (v gamma). Since v = 0.99999987c, which is very close to c, so v ≈ c. Therefore, τ ≈ D / (c * gamma). Since D is in light-years, c is 1 light-year per year. Therefore, τ ≈ D / (gamma) in years.\n\nWait, if D is in light-years and c is 1 light-year/year, then D / c is in years. So yes, τ ≈ D / gamma. So if D is 163,000 light-years, then τ ≈ 163,000 / 1961 ≈ let's calculate this.\n\n163,000 divided by 1961. Let me compute 1961 * 83 = ?\n\nWell, 1961 * 80 = 156,880\n\n1961 * 3 = 5,883\n\nTotal: 156,880 + 5,883 = 162,763. That's very close to 163,000. The difference is 163,000 - 162,763 = 237. So 83 + (237 / 1961) ≈ 83 + 0.12 ≈ 83.12 years. So approximately 83.1 years. But the options are A:81, C:72, D:77. So none of these match exactly. Hmm. Maybe the problem uses a different distance? Let me check the distance again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes a different distance. For example, if the distance is 160,000 light-years, then 160,000 / 1961 ≈ let's see. 1961 * 81 = 158,841. 1961 * 82 = 158,841 + 1961 = 160,802. So 160,000 is between 81 and 82. The difference between 160,000 and 158,841 is 1,159. So 1,159 / 1961 ≈ 0.59. So approximately 81.59 years, which rounds to 82. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a different value for the distance. For example, if the distance is 150,000 light-years, then τ ≈ 150,000 / 1961 ≈ 76.5 years. That would be approximately 77 years, which is option D. Hmm. So if the problem assumes the distance is about 150,000 light-years instead of 163,000, then the answer would be D:77. But why would they use 150,000? The actual distance is about 163,000. Maybe it's a problem in the question's setup, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the distance between the LMC and Earth in a different way. Wait, the LMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, so the distance from the LMC to the center of the Milky Way is about 163,000 light-years, but the distance from the LMC to Earth (which is in the Milky Way) would depend on where in the Milky Way Earth is located. But since Earth is in the Orion Arm, about 27,000 light-years from the galactic center, the distance from the LMC to Earth is roughly the distance from the LMC to the galactic center minus Earth's distance from the galactic center? No, actually, the distance is more like the distance between the two galaxies. The LMC is about 163,000 light-years from the Milky Way, so Earth is within the Milky Way, so the distance from the LMC to Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. So that part seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not using the actual distance but is instead providing a hypothetical scenario where the distance is such that the proper time is one of the given options. But since the problem doesn't specify the distance, this is confusing. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the distance as the distance between the LMC and Earth, but perhaps the problem is using the distance in a different unit? For example, if the distance is given in parsecs, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem doesn't give any distance, which is strange. Wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the distance in a way that's not dependent on the actual value. Let me think. Suppose the distance is D light-years. Then the time in Earth's frame is t = D / v. But since v is almost c, t ≈ D / c = D years. Then the proper time is τ = t / gamma ≈ D / gamma. So if the options are numerical, then the problem must have a specific D in mind. Since the problem is from an exam or quiz, maybe the standard distance is used here. But since I don't have that information, maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the distance between the LMC and Earth as 163,000 light-years, and the answer is approximately 81 years. But none of the options exactly match. However, option A is 81, which is close to my calculation of approximately 83. Maybe the problem rounded the gamma factor or the distance.\n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma with more precision. Let's compute 1 - v²/c² again. v = 0.99999987c. Let me compute v/c = 0.99999987. Let me square that exactly.\n\nLet me write it as 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7. Then (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14. So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈ 2.6e-7. Therefore, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.612, sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 = 3.162e-4. Therefore, 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. Therefore, gamma = 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So if D is 163,000 light-years, then τ = 163,000 / 1964 ≈ 82.9 years. So approximately 83 years. If the options are A:81, then maybe the problem uses a slightly different value for the distance or the speed. For example, if the speed is slightly higher, or the distance slightly shorter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the distance as 160,000 light-years. Then τ = 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 81.4 years, which rounds to 81, matching option A. Given that the options include A:81, this might be the intended answer.\n\nBut why would the problem use 160,000 instead of the actual 163,000? Maybe for simplicity, or perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem's setup. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's suppose that the problem is using the distance D = 160,000 light-years. Then τ = D / gamma ≈ 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 81.4 years. So option A:81 years is the answer. Given that the astronaut is 22 years old, adding 81 years would make them 103 years old, which is less than their 150-year lifespan. Therefore, they would reach Earth before dying, so the answer is A:81 years.\n\nBut why does the problem include option B: The astronaut will die before reaching Earth? If the calculation had resulted in τ = 130 years, then 22 + 130 = 152, which is just over 150, so they would die. But in our calculation, it's around 81 years, so they would live. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check again the exact value of gamma. Maybe I approximated it too roughly. Let me calculate 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) more precisely.\n\nFirst, compute 2.6e-7. Let me write it as 2.6 × 10^-7. Let me compute its square root.\n\nLet me note that sqrt(2.6 × 10^-7) = sqrt(2.6) × sqrt(10^-7) = sqrt(2.6) × 10^(-3.5).\n\nCompute sqrt(2.6): 2.6 is between 2.25 (1.5²) and 2.56 (1.6²). Let me compute 1.61² = 2.5921, which is close to 2.6. 1.61² = 2.5921. 1.612² = (1.61 + 0.002)^2 = 1.61² + 2*1.61*0.002 + 0.002² = 2.5921 + 0.00644 + 0.000004 ≈ 2.598544. Still less than 2.6. 1.6124²: Let me compute 1.6124^2.\n\nLet me use linear approximation. Let me take f(x) = x² at x = 1.612 where f(x) = 2.598544. We want x such that x² = 2.6. Let me solve for delta such that (1.612 + delta)^2 = 2.6.\n\nExpanding: 1.612² + 2*1.612*delta + delta² = 2.6. We know 1.612² ≈ 2.598544. So:\n\n2.598544 + 3.224*delta ≈ 2.6.\n\nSo 3.224*delta ≈ 2.6 - 2.598544 = 0.001456.\n\nTherefore, delta ≈ 0.001456 / 3.224 ≈ 0.0004516.\n\nSo sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.612 + 0.0004516 ≈ 1.61245.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.61245.\n\nNow, sqrt(10^-7) = 10^(-3.5) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.001 * 0.31623 ≈ 0.00031623.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(2.6 × 10^-7) ≈ 1.61245 * 0.00031623 ≈ Let's compute that:\n\n1.61245 * 0.00031623 ≈ \n\nFirst, 1.61245 * 0.0003 = 0.000483735\n\nThen, 1.61245 * 0.00001623 ≈ approximately 0.0000261.\n\nAdding together: 0.000483735 + 0.0000261 ≈ 0.000509835.\n\nSo sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.000509835. Therefore, gamma = 1 / 0.000509835 ≈ 1962. So gamma ≈ 1962.\n\nTherefore, with D = 163,000 light-years, τ = 163,000 / 1962 ≈ let's compute that.\n\nLet me divide 163,000 by 1962:\n\nFirst, note that 1962 * 83 = 1962 * 80 + 1962 * 3 = 156,960 + 5,886 = 162,846.\n\nThe difference between 163,000 and 162,846 is 154. So, 154 / 1962 ≈ 0.0785.\n\nTherefore, τ ≈ 83.0785 years. So approximately 83.08 years.\n\nIf the problem uses D = 163,000 light-years, then the proper time is approximately 83 years, which is not one of the options. However, the options are A:81, C:72, D:77. None of these are close to 83. This suggests that either there's an error in the problem's distance assumption, or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, let me check if the problem is asking for the time from the astronaut's perspective, which is τ ≈ 83 years, and the astronaut is 22 years old. Adding 83 years to 22 gives 105 years, which is less than their 150-year lifespan. Therefore, the astronaut would reach Earth before dying. Therefore, option B is incorrect, and the correct answer is A:81, assuming the problem intended a slightly shorter distance.\n\nBut why is option A 81? If the actual calculation gives about 83, but the options have 81, maybe the problem uses a different value for the distance or a more precise gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the distance as 160,000 light-years. Let's recalculate with D = 160,000:\n\nτ = 160,000 / 1962 ≈ 81.53 years, which rounds to 82, but the closest option is A:81. If the problem rounds down, it could be 81.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different value for the speed. Let me check the exact value of v. The speed is 0.99999987c. Let me compute 1 - v/c = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013 = 1.3e-7. But perhaps there's a calculation mistake in the gamma factor.\n\nWait, let me recompute gamma with more precision. Let's use the exact formula:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14) ≈ 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). As before, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.0005098, so gamma ≈ 1962. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the problem is using the distance as 160,000 light-years and the answer is 81, or perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem's design. Given that the options are A:81, C:72, D:77, and the calculation suggests around 81-83, the most plausible answer is A:81, assuming rounding.\n\nTherefore, the astronaut would experience approximately 81 years of travel, and since 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150, they would reach Earth before dying. Therefore, the correct answer is A:81 years.\n</think>"}
