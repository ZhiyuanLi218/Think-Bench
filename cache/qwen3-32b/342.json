The sample was dissolved in water, and then silver nitrate was added, which precipitated the chloride ions as silver chloride (AgCl). The mass of the precipitate obtained was 0.435 grams. The answer choices are A through D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. When chloride ions (Cl⁻) react with silver ions (Ag⁺), they form silver chloride, which is a white precipitate. The reaction is Ag⁺ + Cl⁻ → AgCl. So, the amount of AgCl formed should be directly related to the amount of Cl⁻ in the original sample.\n\nTo find the percentage of chlorine in the sample, I need to determine how much chlorine was present in the 0.435 grams of AgCl, and then express that as a percentage of the original 2.35-gram sample.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Find the molar mass of AgCl.** Silver (Ag) has an atomic mass of about 107.87 g/mol, and chlorine (Cl) is about 35.45 g/mol. So, the molar mass of AgCl is 107.87 + 35.45 = 143.32 g/mol.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of moles of AgCl precipitated.** Moles = mass / molar mass. So, moles of AgCl = 0.435 g / 143.32 g/mol. Let me compute that. Let me get a calculator... 0.435 divided by 143.32. Hmm, 0.435 ÷ 143.32 ≈ 0.003036 moles. Let me check that again. 143.32 times 0.003 is 0.42996 grams. So, 0.435 grams is a bit more than 0.003 moles. Let me do the exact calculation: 0.435 / 143.32 ≈ 0.003036 mol. Okay, so approximately 0.003036 moles of AgCl.\n\n3. **Since each mole of AgCl contains one mole of Cl⁻, the moles of Cl⁻ in the original sample is the same as the moles of AgCl.** So, moles of Cl⁻ = 0.003036 mol.\n\n4. **Calculate the mass of chlorine in the original sample.** The molar mass of Cl is 35.45 g/mol. So, mass of Cl = moles × molar mass = 0.003036 mol × 35.45 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.003036 × 35.45 ≈ 0.1077 grams. Let me verify: 0.003 × 35.45 = 0.10635, and 0.000036 × 35.45 ≈ 0.001276, so total ≈ 0.10635 + 0.001276 ≈ 0.1076 grams. So approximately 0.1076 grams of Cl in the sample.\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage of chlorine in the original sample.** The original sample was 2.35 grams. So, percentage = (mass of Cl / mass of sample) × 100%. That would be (0.1076 g / 2.35 g) × 100%. Let me compute that. 0.1076 ÷ 2.35 ≈ 0.04578, multiplied by 100% gives approximately 4.578%. \n\nLooking at the answer choices: A is 10.80%, B is 4.60%, C is 43.50%, D is 18%. My calculation gives approximately 4.58%, which is very close to option B: 4.60%. So, the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, molar mass of AgCl: Ag is 107.87, Cl is 35.45, so 107.87 + 35.45 = 143.32 g/mol. Correct.\n\nMoles of AgCl: 0.435 g / 143.32 g/mol. Let me compute this more precisely. Let me do 0.435 divided by 143.32. Let me write it as 435 mg / 143.32 g/mol. Let me convert 0.435 g to 435 mg. But maybe decimal division is easier. Let me use a calculator step-by-step.\n\nDividing 0.435 by 143.32:\n\nFirst, approximate 143.32 × 0.003 = 0.42996, which is 0.430 grams. The actual mass is 0.435 grams, which is 0.435 - 0.430 = 0.005 grams more. So, how much more is that in moles? 0.005 grams divided by 143.32 g/mol ≈ 0.0000349 mol. So total moles ≈ 0.003 + 0.0000349 ≈ 0.0030349 mol. Which is approximately 0.003035 mol. So, that's consistent with my earlier value of 0.003036. So that's correct.\n\nThen, moles of Cl⁻ is same as moles of AgCl, so 0.003035 mol. Then mass of Cl is 0.003035 mol × 35.45 g/mol. Let me compute that again. 35.45 × 0.003 = 0.10635 g. Then 35.45 × 0.000035 = 0.00124075 g. So total ≈ 0.10635 + 0.00124 ≈ 0.10759 g. So approximately 0.1076 g Cl. Correct.\n\nThen, percentage is (0.1076 / 2.35) × 100. Let me compute 0.1076 ÷ 2.35. Let me do this division step by step. 2.35 × 0.04 = 0.094. 2.35 × 0.045 = 0.094 + (2.35 × 0.005) = 0.094 + 0.01175 = 0.10575. 2.35 × 0.0457 = 0.10575 + (2.35 × 0.0007) = 0.10575 + 0.001645 = 0.107395. Which is very close to 0.1076. So, 0.0457 + a little more. Let me see. The difference between 0.107395 and 0.1076 is 0.000205. So, how much more is that? Since 2.35 × x = 0.000205. So x ≈ 0.000205 / 2.35 ≈ 0.000087. So total percentage ≈ 0.0457 + 0.000087 ≈ 0.045787, which is 4.5787%. So approximately 4.58%, which rounds to 4.60%. Therefore, answer B is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this. For example, using mass ratios. The mass of Cl in AgCl can be calculated by the ratio of the molar mass of Cl to that of AgCl. So, mass of Cl = (mass of AgCl) × (molar mass Cl / molar mass AgCl). Let me try that.\n\nMass of Cl = 0.435 g × (35.45 / 143.32). Let's compute 35.45 / 143.32 ≈ 0.2473. Then 0.435 × 0.2473 ≈ Let me calculate that. 0.4 × 0.2473 = 0.09892, 0.035 × 0.2473 ≈ 0.0086555. Total ≈ 0.09892 + 0.0086555 ≈ 0.107575 g. Which is the same as before, 0.1076 g. Then percentage is same as before. So this method also gives the same result. So this confirms the answer is 4.58%, which is 4.60% when rounded. So answer B is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. The answer is B: 4.60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
