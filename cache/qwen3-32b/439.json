The given data includes the solubility product (Ks) for AgCl, which is 1.56×10⁻¹⁰, and the stability constants β₁ = 2.1×10³ and β₂ = 1.7×10⁷. The answer choices are A through D, so I need to calculate the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should recall how AgCl dissolves in ammonia. Ammonia forms complexes with silver ions. The dissolution reaction would involve AgCl reacting with NH3 to form a complex ion. The relevant equilibria here are:\n\n1. Dissolution of AgCl: AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag⁺ + Cl⁻; Ks = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = 1.56×10⁻¹⁰\n2. Complexation of Ag⁺ with NH3:\n   - First step: Ag⁺ + NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)]⁺; β₁ = [Ag(NH3)⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH3]) = 2.1×10³\n   - Second step: [Ag(NH3)]⁺ + NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺; β₂ = [Ag(NH3)₂⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH3]²) = 1.7×10⁷\n\nBut since β₁ and β₂ are given, maybe it's easier to consider the overall complexation. The overall formation constant for Ag(NH3)₂⁺ would be β2, which is the product of β1 and the second step's constant. Wait, actually β1 is for the first complex and β2 is for the second. So the overall formation constant (β) for Ag(NH3)₂⁺ is β2 = 1.7×10⁷. Alternatively, sometimes these constants are given as cumulative, so β2 would be the product of β1 and the stepwise constant for the second step. But since β1 and β2 are given, I need to check if β2 is the cumulative one. If β2 is the cumulative stability constant, then yes, it's [Ag(NH3)₂⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH3]²). So I can use that directly.\n\nNow, when AgCl dissolves in ammonia, the silver ions form complexes with ammonia. The total silver concentration is given as 0.01 M, which includes all forms of silver: Ag⁺, [Ag(NH3)]⁺, and [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺. But since ammonia is in excess, the predominant species is likely [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺. However, I need to account for all species to be precise.\n\nLet me denote the total silver concentration as [Ag_total] = [Ag⁺] + [Ag(NH3)⁺] + [Ag(NH3)₂⁺] = 0.01 M.\n\nBut solving this with all three terms might be complicated. Maybe I can approximate? If the complexation is very strong (since β2 is 1.7×10⁷), then most of the silver is in the form of [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺. So perhaps I can approximate [Ag_total] ≈ [Ag(NH3)₂⁺]. Let me check if that's a valid assumption.\n\nIf I assume that [Ag⁺] and [Ag(NH3)⁺] are negligible compared to [Ag(NH3)₂⁺], then [Ag_total] ≈ [Ag(NH3)₂⁺] = 0.01 M. Then, using the complexation equilibrium:\n\nβ2 = [Ag(NH3)₂⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH3]²) = 1.7×10⁷.\n\nBut also, from the dissolution of AgCl, we have Ks = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻]. However, in this case, AgCl is dissolving, so the concentration of Cl⁻ should be equal to the total silver concentration? Wait, no. Because each mole of AgCl releases one mole of Ag and one mole of Cl⁻. But since Ag is complexed, the total Ag is 0.01 M, so [Cl⁻] should also be 0.01 M? Wait, if the dissolution is stoichiometric, meaning that AgCl dissolves in a 1:1 ratio with the complexes formed? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWhen AgCl dissolves, for every mole of AgCl that dissolves, we get one mole of Ag (in any form) and one mole of Cl⁻. Since the total silver concentration is 0.01 M, that would mean [Cl⁻] is also 0.01 M, assuming all Ag comes from AgCl. So [Cl⁻] = 0.01 M. Therefore, from the solubility product:\n\nKs = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = 1.56×10⁻¹⁰. Since [Cl⁻] = 0.01 M, then [Ag⁺] = Ks / [Cl⁻] = 1.56×10⁻¹⁰ / 0.01 = 1.56×10⁻⁸ M. Which is very small, which supports the assumption that most silver is in the complexed form. Therefore, [Ag⁺] is negligible compared to the complex concentrations. Therefore, maybe I can proceed with that.\n\nSo, using β2 = [Ag(NH3)₂⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH3]²). But [Ag(NH3)₂⁺] ≈ [Ag_total] = 0.01 M, and [Ag⁺] ≈ 1.56×10⁻⁸ M. Therefore:\n\nβ2 ≈ 0.01 / (1.56×10⁻⁸ * [NH3]²) = 1.7×10⁷.\n\nSolving for [NH3]²:\n\n[NH3]² ≈ 0.01 / (1.7×10⁷ * 1.56×10⁻⁸) = 0.01 / (2.652×10⁻¹) ≈ 0.01 / 0.2652 ≈ 0.0377.\n\nTherefore, [NH3] ≈ sqrt(0.0377) ≈ 0.194 M. Which is option C. But wait, let me check the calculation again step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the denominator:\n\n1.7×10⁷ * 1.56×10⁻⁸ = 1.7 * 1.56 * 10^(7-8) = 2.652 * 10⁻¹ = 0.2652.\n\nThen 0.01 / 0.2652 ≈ 0.0377. Taking square root gives approx 0.194 M. So that would be answer C. However, let me check if there are other contributions. For example, if I didn't neglect [Ag(NH3)]⁺, would that affect the result?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the mass balance for ammonia. The total ammonia concentration would be the free NH3 plus the ammonia bound in complexes. But since the problem says \"the concentration of the ammonia solution\", which is probably the total ammonia concentration, but maybe they mean the free ammonia? Wait, no, when they say \"concentration of the ammonia solution\", that would be the total concentration, because when you prepare a solution, you add a certain amount of ammonia, which then gets partially consumed in complexation. However, in the calculation above, I only considered [NH3] as the free ammonia. But the problem is asking for the concentration of the ammonia solution, which would be the total ammonia added, which is free NH3 plus ammonia bound in complexes.\n\nWait, hold on. My previous approach only considered the free NH3 concentration. But the question is asking for the concentration of the ammonia solution, which is the total ammonia concentration. Therefore, I need to account for the ammonia that is bound in the complexes as well. So my previous approach is incomplete.\n\nLet me re-examine. Let me denote:\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet’s assume that the total silver concentration is 0.01 M, which is [Ag_total] = [Ag⁺] + [Ag(NH3)⁺] + [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺ = 0.01 M.\n\nAlso, from the dissolution of AgCl, [Cl⁻] = 0.01 M.\n\nFrom Ks: [Ag⁺] = Ks / [Cl⁻] = 1.56×10⁻¹⁰ / 0.01 = 1.56×10⁻⁸ M, as before.\n\nNow, for the complexation reactions. Let me define the ammonia concentration. Let’s denote the total ammonia concentration as [NH3]_total, which is the concentration of the ammonia solution we need to find. However, in solution, ammonia is present as free NH3 and as part of the complexes. The ammonia bound in the complexes can be calculated from the silver complexes.\n\nThe mass balance for ammonia is:\n\n[NH3]_total = [NH3] + [Ag(NH3)]⁺ + 2[Ag(NH3)₂]⁺.\n\nBecause each [Ag(NH3)]⁺ has one NH3, and each [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺ has two NH3.\n\nBut since we know [Ag_total] = [Ag⁺] + [Ag(NH3)]⁺ + [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺ = 0.01 M, and [Ag⁺] is negligible (1.56e-8 M), we can approximate [Ag_total] ≈ [Ag(NH3)]⁺ + [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺ ≈ 0.01 M.\n\nBut how do we relate [Ag(NH3)]⁺ and [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺? Using the stability constants.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet’s define the concentration of [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺ as C. Then, since [Ag_total] ≈ C + [Ag(NH3)]⁺ ≈ 0.01 M. But we need another equation to relate these.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the stability constants. The overall formation constant β2 is [Ag(NH3)₂⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH3]²) = 1.7×10⁷. From this, we can write:\n\n[Ag(NH3)₂⁺] = β2 * [Ag⁺] * [NH3]².\n\nBut [Ag_total] ≈ [Ag(NH3)₂⁺] + [Ag(NH3)+] + [Ag+] ≈ [Ag(NH3)₂⁺] + [Ag(NH3)+]. But if we consider that the second complex is predominant, maybe we can approximate [Ag_total] ≈ [Ag(NH3)₂⁺]. However, perhaps we need to account for the first complex as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the stepwise constants. Let me think.\n\nThe first complex has β1 = [Ag(NH3)+]/([Ag+][NH3]) = 2.1×10³.\n\nThe second complex has β2 = [Ag(NH3)₂+]/([Ag+][NH3]²) = 1.7×10⁷.\n\nBut the overall formation constant for the second complex is also the product of β1 and the stepwise constant for the second step. However, since β2 is already given, maybe I can use that directly.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express all species in terms of [Ag+], [NH3], and then use the mass balance.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet’s let’s define x = [Ag+], y = [NH3].\n\nFrom Ks, we have x = 1.56×10⁻¹⁰ / [Cl⁻] = 1.56×10⁻¹⁰ / 0.01 = 1.56×10⁻⁸ M, as before.\n\nNow, the concentration of [Ag(NH3)+] can be written as β1 * x * y.\n\nSimilarly, [Ag(NH3)₂+] = β2 * x * y².\n\nTherefore, the total silver concentration is:\n\n[Ag_total] = x + β1 x y + β2 x y² = 0.01 M.\n\nPlugging in x = 1.56×10⁻⁸:\n\n1.56×10⁻⁸ + (2.1×10³)(1.56×10⁻⁸)y + (1.7×10⁷)(1.56×10⁻⁸)y² = 0.01.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1.56×10⁻⁸ ≈ 1.56e-8 ≈ negligible compared to 0.01, so we can ignore it.\n\nSecond term: 2.1e3 * 1.56e-8 * y = (3.276e-5) * y\n\nThird term: 1.7e7 * 1.56e-8 * y² = (2.652e-1) * y² ≈ 0.2652 * y²\n\nSo the equation becomes approximately:\n\n3.276×10⁻⁵ * y + 0.2652 * y² ≈ 0.01.\n\nNow, let's write this as:\n\n0.2652 y² + 0.00003276 y - 0.01 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of y. Let me write it as:\n\na y² + b y + c = 0,\n\nwhere a = 0.2652,\n\nb = 3.276×10⁻⁵,\n\nc = -0.01.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nBut since c is negative, the discriminant will be positive.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = b² - 4ac = (3.276×10⁻⁵)^2 - 4 * 0.2652 * (-0.01)\n\nFirst term: ~ 1.073×10⁻⁹\n\nSecond term: -4 * 0.2652 * (-0.01) = 0.010608\n\nSo D ≈ 0.010608 + 1.073×10⁻⁹ ≈ 0.010608.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.010608) ≈ 0.103.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny ≈ [ -3.276×10⁻⁵ ± 0.103 ] / (2 * 0.2652 )\n\nWe discard the negative root because concentration can't be negative, so:\n\ny ≈ [ -0.00003276 + 0.103 ] / 0.5304 ≈ 0.102967 / 0.5304 ≈ 0.1941 M.\n\nSo y ≈ 0.194 M, which is option C. However, this y is [NH3], the free ammonia concentration. But the problem asks for the concentration of the ammonia solution, which is the total ammonia concentration, [NH3]_total.\n\nEarlier, I neglected to account for the ammonia bound in the complexes. So now, I need to calculate [NH3]_total = [NH3] + [Ag(NH3)+] + 2[Ag(NH3)₂+].\n\nWe have [NH3] = y ≈ 0.194 M.\n\n[Ag(NH3)+] = β1 x y ≈ 2.1×10³ * 1.56×10⁻⁸ * 0.194 ≈ Let's calculate:\n\nFirst, 2.1e3 * 1.56e-8 = 3.276e-5, as before. Multiply by 0.194:\n\n3.276e-5 * 0.194 ≈ 6.35e-6 M.\n\nSimilarly, [Ag(NH3)₂+] = β2 x y² ≈ 1.7e7 * 1.56e-8 * (0.194)^2.\n\nFirst compute 1.7e7 * 1.56e-8 = 0.2652, as before. Then multiply by (0.194)^2 ≈ 0.0376:\n\n0.2652 * 0.0376 ≈ 0.00997 M ≈ 0.01 M.\n\nTherefore, [NH3]_total ≈ 0.194 + 6.35e-6 + 2*(0.00997) ≈ 0.194 + 0.00000635 + 0.01994 ≈ 0.194 + 0.01994 ≈ 0.2139 M. Adding the negligible 6.35e-6 gives ≈ 0.2139 M.\n\nSo approximately 0.214 M, which is option A. Wait, but earlier calculation for y gave 0.194 M, but the total ammonia concentration is higher because we have to add the ammonia bound in the complexes. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 0.214 M?\n\nBut this contradicts the previous conclusion. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nThe problem says: \"the concentration of the ammonia solution\". When you dissolve AgCl in ammonia solution, the ammonia solution's concentration refers to the total concentration of ammonia added, which includes free NH3 and the ammonia that's complexed. Therefore, the answer is [NH3]_total ≈ 0.214 M, which would be option A. However, in my initial approach, I only calculated the free NH3 concentration (0.194 M) and thought it was the answer, but actually, the total ammonia concentration is higher. Therefore, the correct answer is A?\n\nBut let me verify the calculation again.\n\nGiven:\n\n[NH3]_total = [NH3] + [Ag(NH3)+] + 2[Ag(NH3)₂+]\n\nFrom above:\n\n[NH3] ≈ 0.194 M\n\n[Ag(NH3)+] ≈ 6.35×10⁻⁶ M ≈ 0.00000635 M\n\n[Ag(NH3)₂+] ≈ 0.00997 M ≈ 0.01 M\n\nTherefore:\n\n[NH3]_total ≈ 0.194 + 0.00000635 + 2*(0.00997) ≈ 0.194 + 0.01994 ≈ 0.2139 M ≈ 0.214 M. So yes, that's option A.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the answer options include A:0.214 M and C:0.194 M. So why did my first calculation give 0.194 M for free NH3 and then 0.214 M for total? But the question is asking for the concentration of the ammonia solution, which is the total concentration. Therefore, the answer should be A: 0.214 M.\n\nBut let me check again the calculation for [Ag(NH3)₂+]. Earlier, I said [Ag(NH3)₂+] ≈ 0.01 M. But [Ag_total] is 0.01 M. However, [Ag_total] ≈ [Ag(NH3)₂+] + [Ag(NH3)+] + [Ag+]. Since [Ag(NH3)+] is ~6.35e-6 and [Ag+] is ~1.56e-8, then [Ag(NH3)₂+] ≈ 0.01 - 6.35e-6 ≈ 0.0099936 M ≈ 0.01 M. So that is correct.\n\nTherefore, the ammonia bound in complexes is [Ag(NH3)+] + 2[Ag(NH3)₂+] ≈ 6.35e-6 + 2*0.0099936 ≈ 0.01999 M. Adding that to the free NH3 (0.194 M) gives total ammonia ≈ 0.2139 M, which is 0.214 M (option A). Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nBut why did the initial approach where I considered only [Ag(NH3)₂+] and calculated [NH3] ≈ 0.194 M give me that value? Because that was the free NH3 concentration. However, the problem is asking for the total concentration of the ammonia solution, so we must include the ammonia that is complexed. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by considering the overall reaction.\n\nThe dissolution of AgCl in ammonia can be represented by combining the solubility and complexation reactions:\n\nAgCl(s) + 2 NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺ + Cl⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction can be calculated by combining Ks and β2. The K for this reaction is K = Ks * β2.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nThe dissolution reaction is AgCl ⇌ Ag⁺ + Cl⁻ (Ks), and Ag⁺ + 2 NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺ (β2 = [Ag(NH3)₂⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH3]²)). Therefore, combining these two reactions:\n\nAgCl + 2 NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺ + Cl⁻ with K = Ks * β2 = (1.56×10⁻¹⁰)(1.7×10⁷) ≈ 2.652×10⁻³.\n\nTherefore, K ≈ 2.65×10⁻³.\n\nNow, for this reaction, the expression is:\n\nK = ([Ag(NH3)₂⁺][Cl⁻]) / [NH3]².\n\nGiven that the total silver concentration is [Ag_total] ≈ [Ag(NH3)₂⁺] = 0.01 M, and [Cl⁻] = 0.01 M, then:\n\nK = (0.01 * 0.01) / [NH3]² = 1×10⁻⁴ / [NH3]² = 2.65×10⁻³.\n\nSolving for [NH3]²:\n\n[NH3]² = 1×10⁻⁴ / 2.65×10⁻³ ≈ 0.0377.\n\n[NH3] ≈ 0.194 M. Again, this gives the free NH3 concentration. But the total ammonia concentration is higher because of the ammonia in the complexes. Therefore, using this approach, we also get 0.194 M for free NH3, and then need to add the ammonia in the complex.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, total ammonia is ~0.214 M. Therefore, the answer should be A: 0.214 M. However, the options given include A and C. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nBut wait, perhaps in this overall reaction approach, the [NH3] in the denominator is the free NH3 concentration, and the total ammonia is [NH3] + 2[Ag(NH3)₂⁺] + [Ag(NH3)+]. But if we use this approach, and calculate total ammonia, we get the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the concentration of ammonia refers to the free ammonia concentration? But that seems unlikely, because when you prepare a solution, the concentration refers to the total amount you add, not just the free part. However, sometimes in such problems, they might just ask for the free ammonia concentration. But the wording here is \"the concentration of the ammonia solution\", which is ambiguous. However, given that the answer choices include both 0.194 and 0.214, and considering that in my detailed calculation, the total ammonia is 0.214 M, which is option A, I think that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check once more the exact question wording: \"What is the concentration of the ammonia solution?\" When you dissolve AgCl in ammonia solution, you start with a certain concentration of ammonia solution. After dissolution, the ammonia solution's concentration would be the total amount of ammonia present, which includes free ammonia and that complexed with silver. Therefore, the answer should be the total concentration, which is 0.214 M (option A).\n\nBut why did the first approach using the combined reaction give me the free ammonia? Because in that reaction, the equilibrium expression uses the free ammonia concentration. Hence, to get the total ammonia, I need to add the ammonia bound in complexes.\n\nBut let me calculate it again:\n\nTotal ammonia concentration = [NH3] + [Ag(NH3)+] + 2[Ag(NH3)₂+]\n\nWe have:\n\n[NH3] = 0.194 M (free)\n\n[Ag(NH3)+] ≈ β1 * [Ag+] * [NH3] = 2.1×10³ * 1.56×10⁻⁸ * 0.194 ≈ 6.35×10⁻⁶ M\n\n[Ag(NH3)₂+] ≈ 0.01 M\n\nTherefore, total ammonia:\n\n0.194 + 6.35e-6 + 2*0.01 ≈ 0.194 + 0.02 ≈ 0.214 M. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo the correct answer is A: 0.214 M.\n\nBut why is option C also there? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that [Ag(NH3)₂+] is 0.01 M?\n\nWait, total silver concentration is 0.01 M, which is [Ag_total] = [Ag⁺] + [Ag(NH3)+] + [Ag(NH3)₂+]. We approximated [Ag_total] ≈ [Ag(NH3)₂+] because [Ag+] and [Ag(NH3)+] are small. But let's check:\n\n[Ag+] = 1.56×10⁻⁸ M\n\n[Ag(NH3)+] ≈ 6.35×10⁻⁶ M\n\nSo total of these two is ≈ 6.35×10⁻⁶ + 1.56×10⁻⁸ ≈ 6.36×10⁻⁶ M, which is negligible compared to 0.01 M. Therefore, [Ag(NH3)₂+] ≈ 0.01 M is a valid approximation. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 0.214 M. However, I initially thought it was C, but after considering the total ammonia concentration, it's A.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way this problem could be approached where the answer is C. For example, if someone forgot to account for the ammonia in the complexes and just reported the free ammonia concentration, they would choose C. But according to the proper calculation, it's A.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices:\n\nA:0.214 M\n\nB:0.223 M\n\nC:0.194 M\n\nD:0.201 M\n\nSo if the question had asked for the free ammonia concentration, the answer would be C. But since it asks for the concentration of the ammonia solution, which is total, the answer is A.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my calculation of total ammonia is correct. Let me recast:\n\nTotal ammonia = free NH3 + NH3 in complexes.\n\nNH3 in complexes:\n\nEach [Ag(NH3)+] has 1 NH3, and each [Ag(NH3)₂+] has 2 NH3.\n\nSo total ammonia from complexes is:\n\n[Ag(NH3)+] * 1 + [Ag(NH3)₂+] * 2 ≈ 6.35e-6 + 2*0.01 ≈ 0.02 + 0.000006 ≈ 0.020006 M.\n\nFree NH3 is ≈ 0.194 M.\n\nTotal ≈ 0.194 + 0.02 = 0.214 M. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 0.214 M.\n\nBut let me check if there is a mistake in the assumption that [Ag(NH3)₂+] is 0.01 M. Let's go back to the equation where we had:\n\n[Ag_total] = x + β1 x y + β2 x y² ≈ 0.01.\n\nWe approximated x as negligible, so:\n\nβ1 x y + β2 x y² ≈ 0.01.\n\nBut x is 1.56e-8. Let me plug in the numbers again:\n\nβ1 x y = 2.1e3 * 1.56e-8 * 0.194 ≈ 2.1e3 * 1.56e-8 * 0.194 ≈ Let me compute 2.1e3 * 0.194 = 407.4; then 407.4 * 1.56e-8 ≈ 6.35e-6, as before.\n\nβ2 x y² = 1.7e7 * 1.56e-8 * (0.194)^2 ≈ 1.7e7 * 1.56e-8 * 0.0376 ≈ (1.7 * 1.56 * 0.0376) * 1e-1 ≈ Let me compute:\n\n1.7 * 1.56 = 2.652; 2.652 * 0.0376 ≈ 0.0997. Then times 1e-1? Wait, no:\n\nWait, 1.7e7 * 1.56e-8 = 1.7 * 1.56 * 1e-1 = 2.652 * 0.1 = 0.2652. Then multiplied by y² = 0.0376 gives 0.2652 * 0.0376 ≈ 0.00997, which is ≈ 0.01. So indeed, β2 x y² ≈ 0.00997, and β1 x y ≈ 0.00000635. Adding them gives ≈ 0.00997 + 0.00000635 ≈ 0.009976, which is slightly less than 0.01. The difference is about 0.0000234. Where is that?\n\nAh, because we neglected the x term, which is 1.56e-8 ≈ 1.56e-8. So total [Ag_total] ≈ 1.56e-8 + 0.009976 ≈ 0.009976 + 0.0000000156 ≈ 0.009976 M, which is slightly less than 0.01 M. Therefore, our approximation introduced a small error. To get a more accurate value, we need to solve the quadratic equation properly.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\n0.2652 y² + 0.00003276 y - 0.01 = 0.\n\nWe approximated the solution as y ≈ 0.194 M. Let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [-b + sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a.\n\nWhere a = 0.2652, b = 0.00003276, c = -0.01.\n\nDiscriminant D = b² - 4ac = (0.00003276)^2 - 4*0.2652*(-0.01).\n\nAs before, D ≈ 0.00003276² + 0.010608 ≈ 1.07e-9 + 0.010608 ≈ 0.010608.\n\nsqrt(D) ≈ 0.103.\n\nSo y ≈ [ -0.00003276 + 0.103 ] / (2 * 0.2652) ≈ (0.102967) / 0.5304 ≈ 0.1941 M.\n\nSo y ≈ 0.1941 M. Therefore, the free NH3 is 0.1941 M. Plugging back into the equation:\n\nβ2 x y² = 0.2652 * (0.1941)^2 ≈ 0.2652 * 0.03767 ≈ 0.01000 M. Adding the β1 term gives 0.00000635, so total [Ag_total] ≈ 0.01000 + 0.00000635 ≈ 0.010006 M, which is very close to 0.01 M. The small discrepancy is due to rounding. Therefore, our value of y = 0.1941 M is accurate enough, leading to total ammonia ≈ 0.214 M.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A: 0.214 M.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible mistake. For example, did I use the correct stability constants?\n\nThe problem states β1 = 2.1×10³ and β2 = 1.7×10⁷. These are cumulative constants? Wait, β1 is for the formation of [Ag(NH3)]⁺, and β2 is for [Ag(NH3)₂]⁺. So β2 is the cumulative constant, which is equal to β1 * K2, where K2 is the stepwise constant for the second step. However, in our calculation, we used β2 directly, which is correct. Therefore, no mistake here.\n\nAnother check: Let's assume the total ammonia concentration is 0.214 M. Then, the free ammonia concentration is [NH3] = 0.214 - [Ag(NH3)+] - 2[Ag(NH3)₂+]. But since [Ag(NH3)+] and [Ag(NH3)₂+] depend on [NH3], it's a bit circular. However, since we already solved it through the quadratic equation and found that free [NH3] ≈ 0.194 M, and total ≈ 0.214 M, this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I conclude the correct answer is A: 0.214 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
