So, there's a lunar probe orbiting the moon in a circular path just above the surface. The question is asking which of the options A to D are correct. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall the basic concepts. When an object is in circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force. The formula for gravitational force between two masses is Newton's law of gravitation: F = G*(M*m)/r². Since the probe is orbiting close to the lunar surface, the radius of the orbit should be approximately equal to the radius of the moon, R. \n\nSo, the gravitational force is acting as the centripetal force, so I can set them equal: G*M*m/R² = m*v²/R. Wait, the m cancels out here, so v² = G*M/R, so v = sqrt(G*M/R). That looks like option A. So option A says linear velocity v equals sqrt(GM/R). So that seems correct. So A is correct?\n\nBut let me check the other options too. Let's see. Option B: angular velocity ω equals sqrt(gR). Angular velocity is related to linear velocity by ω = v/R. From the previous calculation, v = sqrt(GM/R), so ω = sqrt(GM/R³). But the problem mentions that the gravitational acceleration on the moon's surface is g. Let me recall that on the surface, g = G*M/R². Therefore, GM = g R². Let me substitute that into the expression for ω. So ω = sqrt( (g R²)/R³ ) = sqrt(g/R). But option B says sqrt(gR). So there's a discrepancy here. The correct angular velocity would be sqrt(g/R), but option B says sqrt(gR). So B is incorrect. Hmm.\n\nOption C: orbital period T = 2π√(R/g). Let's recall that the period T is 2π/ω. If ω is sqrt(g/R), then T would be 2π / sqrt(g/R) = 2π√(R/g). Which matches option C. So C is correct? Wait, earlier I found that if we use the relation between g and GM, then we can get expressions in terms of g. So since option C is T = 2π√(R/g), which we just derived, that seems correct. So option C is correct?\n\nOption D: centripetal acceleration a = Gm/R². Wait, centripetal acceleration is v²/R. From earlier, v² is GM/R, so a = GM/R². But the problem says a = Gm/R². Wait, that seems wrong because it's using the probe's mass m instead of the moon's mass M. So D is incorrect. Also, the centripetal acceleration should be due to the moon's gravity, so it should depend on M, not m. So D is definitely wrong.\n\nSo from this analysis, A and C are correct. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with A: v = sqrt(GM/R). Yes, because equating gravitational force to centripetal force gives that. Since F_grav = G*M*m/R² and F_centripetal = m*v²/R. Equate them, m cancels, solve for v. So A is correct.\n\nFor B: angular velocity. Let me recast. Angular velocity ω = v/R. So substituting v from A, ω = sqrt(GM/R)/R = sqrt(GM/R³). Then since g = GM/R², we can replace GM with gR². Then ω becomes sqrt( (gR²)/R³ ) = sqrt(g/R). Therefore, ω = sqrt(g/R). But option B says sqrt(gR). So B is wrong. So B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: T = 2π√(R/g). Since T = 2π/ω. If ω is sqrt(g/R), then T is 2π divided by sqrt(g/R) which is 2π * sqrt(R/g). So yes, that's correct. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: a = Gm/R². No, as we saw, a is GM/R². So D is wrong because it uses m instead of M, and also the probe's mass shouldn't affect its own orbital acceleration. So D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C. But wait, the problem says \"the spacecraft's ( )\", and the options are A to D. The original question is in Chinese maybe? The user wrote \"Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So probably multiple options can be correct? Wait, but in the original problem statement, is it multiple choice? The way it's written, the options are labeled (A) through (D), and the user is supposed to pick which ones are correct. But in some cases, these problems might have multiple correct answers. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe problem says \"the spacecraft's ( ) Options: (A)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So likely, there are multiple correct answers. So in this case, A and C are correct. Let me check again if there's any other possibilities.\n\nWait, let me check if there's another way to get the centripetal acceleration. The centripetal acceleration is equal to the gravitational acceleration at that orbit. Since it's close to the lunar surface, the centripetal acceleration should be approximately equal to the lunar surface gravity g. But according to the formula, a = GM/R² = g. So the centripetal acceleration is g. But option D says a = Gm/R². Which is not g, unless m is somehow related. But m is the probe's mass. So D is incorrect. So yes, A and C are correct.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) v = sqrt(GM/R)\n\nB) ω = sqrt(gR)\n\nC) T = 2π sqrt(R/g)\n\nD) a = Gm/R²\n\nSo A and C are correct. However, let me check if there is another way to express the angular velocity. For example, using the relation between angular velocity and period. Since T = 2π√(R/g), then ω = 2π / T = sqrt(g/R). Which again confirms that B is wrong. So only A and C are correct.\n\nBut let me check if the problem might have different expectations. For example, maybe the problem expects using g = GM/R², so in option A, since GM/R is equal to gR. Wait, because g = GM/R² => GM = gR². Therefore, GM/R is gR. Therefore, option A's expression sqrt(GM/R) is sqrt(gR). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion? Wait, hold on. Wait, if GM/R is equal to gR? Wait, no:\n\nWait, if g = GM/R², then multiplying both sides by R gives gR = GM/R. Therefore, GM/R = gR? Wait, no:\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nStarting with g = GM/R². Multiply both sides by R: gR = GM/R. Therefore, GM/R = gR? Wait, no:\n\nWait, if you have gR = GM/R, then GM/R is equal to gR? Wait, that would mean that GM/R = gR => GM = g R². Which is true because g = GM/R². So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the expression for v is sqrt(GM/R) which is sqrt(gR). Wait, but earlier I thought option A was correct, but according to this, sqrt(GM/R) equals sqrt(gR). But then, if that's the case, then option A is equivalent to sqrt(gR). But earlier, when I derived the angular velocity, I found that ω is sqrt(g/R). But then, if v is sqrt(gR), then ω = v/R = sqrt(gR)/R = sqrt(g/R). Which is correct. So option A is correct because v = sqrt(GM/R) = sqrt(gR). But does that mean that there's another way to write it?\n\nBut in the options, option B is ω = sqrt(gR). Which is not correct because ω is sqrt(g/R). Therefore, option B is wrong. So option A is correct. So A is correct. So that's okay.\n\nBut then, if v = sqrt(gR), then why is option B not correct? Because angular velocity is v/R, so sqrt(gR)/R = sqrt(g/R). Therefore, option B is wrong. So A is correct, C is correct, and D is wrong.\n\nBut let me check option C again. T = 2π√(R/g). Let's derive it another way. The orbital period is T = 2πR / v. If v is sqrt(gR), then T = 2πR / sqrt(gR) = 2π sqrt(R/g). Yes, that's correct. So option C is correct. Therefore, options A and C are correct.\n\nBut the original problem gives four options, and the user is supposed to select the correct ones. However, looking back at the problem statement, the original question is in Chinese? The user wrote the question in English, but maybe in the original context, it's a multiple-choice question where multiple options can be correct. However, in some cases, depending on the source, maybe only one is correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me check if there's a possibility that option A is wrong. For example, if the orbit is close to the lunar surface, is the radius of the orbit exactly R? Well, the problem says \"close to the lunar surface\", so we can approximate the orbital radius as R. Therefore, yes, A is correct. So A is correct.\n\nSo in conclusion, options A and C are correct. But let me check if the given options are presented as multiple select or single select. The way the question is presented here, the user says \"Options: (A)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So maybe in the original problem, multiple can be correct. However, looking at the options again, let me check if there's any other possible mistake.\n\nWait, option D says centripetal acceleration is Gm/R². But centripetal acceleration is GM/R², which is equal to g. So D is wrong because it has m instead of M and also the expression is wrong. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answers are A and C. However, let me check the original options again. The options are labeled A to D. The problem is presented in Chinese, but translated here. In some educational systems, multiple choice questions might have multiple correct answers, but sometimes they might be structured differently. However, given the analysis, A and C are correct. But let me check again if maybe there's a mistake in my derivation.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's recall that for a circular orbit near the surface, the speed is similar to the first cosmic velocity. For Earth, we have v = sqrt(gR), where g is Earth's surface gravity. Similarly, here, since the probe is near the moon's surface, its orbital speed would be sqrt(gR). But according to option A, it's sqrt(GM/R). Since we know that g = GM/R², so GM/R is gR. Therefore, sqrt(GM/R) is sqrt(gR). Therefore, option A and the expression sqrt(gR) are equivalent. But option A is written in terms of G, M, and R, while if we use g, it's sqrt(gR). However, option B is ω = sqrt(gR), which is not correct. So option A is correct. Therefore, A and C are correct.\n\nTherefore, if the options are multiple select, the correct answers are A and C. But looking back at the problem statement, the way it's presented here, the user hasn't specified whether it's multiple correct or single correct. In Chinese standardized tests, sometimes they have multiple correct options, but often each question is single answer. However, given the analysis, both A and C are correct. Let me check if the original problem might have different options or if there's any other consideration.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the spacecraft's ( )\", with the parentheses probably expecting multiple answers. Given that, and since both A and C are correct, but looking at the options, let me check if maybe there's an error in my thinking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation for option C. Let me recalculate T. The period T is 2πR / v. If v is sqrt(GM/R), then T is 2πR / sqrt(GM/R) = 2πR * sqrt(R/(GM)) = 2π sqrt(R³/(GM)). Now, since g = GM/R², then GM = gR². Substitute that into the expression for T: T = 2π sqrt(R³/(gR²)) = 2π sqrt(R/g). Which is exactly option C. Therefore, option C is correct. So yes, C is correct.\n\nTherefore, both A and C are correct. However, looking at the options given, if the original question is from a source where multiple answers are possible, then A and C. But maybe in the original problem's context, only one is correct? Let me check if there is any other possible mistake.\n\nWait, let me check if the centripetal acceleration in option D is written as Gm/R². If the probe's mass is m, then the gravitational force on it is G*M*m/R², so the acceleration is F/m = GM/R², which is equal to g. Therefore, the centripetal acceleration is g, not Gm/R². So D is definitely wrong.\n\nSo in conclusion, options A and C are correct. But let me check if the original problem's options are presented as multiple correct answers. In some cases, especially in Chinese exams, sometimes options are structured such that only one is correct. However, given the mathematical derivation, both A and C are correct. Therefore, the answer should be options A and C.\n\nBut looking back at the user's input, they wrote \"Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So maybe they expect multiple letters. However, in the initial problem statement, it's possible that the original question had only one correct answer. Wait, let me check if there's any other way.\n\nWait, let me check if there's an error in assuming that the orbital radius is R. The problem says \"flying in an orbit close to the lunar surface\", so we can approximate the orbital radius as R. If the orbit is very close, then yes, R is the radius. Therefore, the calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the moon's gravitational acceleration on the surface, g, and not involving G and M? For example, if you don't know G, but you know g, you can express things in terms of g. So for example, option A can be written as sqrt(gR) since GM/R is gR. Therefore, option A is equivalent to sqrt(gR). But option A is written in terms of G and M, which is also correct. So both expressions are valid.\n\nTherefore, options A and C are correct. If the original question allows multiple correct answers, then the answer is A and C. However, if the options are structured as single answer, maybe there's a trick. But given the information, I think both A and C are correct.\n\nBut looking back at the options given:\n\n(A) linear velocity v = sqrt(GM/R)\n\n(B) angular velocity ω = sqrt(gR)\n\n(C) orbital period T = 2π√(R/g)\n\n(D) centripetal acceleration a = Gm/R²\n\nSo A and C are correct. However, in some textbooks or problem sets, sometimes only one option is considered correct. Let me check if there's any possible error in my analysis.\n\nAnother way: Let's compute numerical values hypothetically. Suppose we take the moon's parameters. Let's say R_moon ≈ 1.737×10^6 m, M_moon ≈ 7.342×10^22 kg, G ≈ 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². Then g on the moon is GM/R². Let me compute that:\n\ng = (6.674e-11 * 7.342e22) / (1.737e6)^2.\n\nFirst compute numerator: 6.674e-11 * 7.342e22 ≈ 4.9e12.\n\nDenominator: (1.737e6)^2 ≈ 3.017e12.\n\nSo g ≈ 4.9e12 / 3.017e12 ≈ 1.62 m/s², which matches the actual moon's surface gravity.\n\nNow, let's compute v = sqrt(GM/R). Using the numbers:\n\nGM = 6.674e-11 * 7.342e22 ≈ 4.9e12 N·m²/kg.\n\nDivide by R: 4.9e12 / 1.737e6 ≈ 2.82e6 m²/s².\n\nTake square root: sqrt(2.82e6) ≈ 1.68e3 m/s. Which is about 1.68 km/s. Actual orbital velocity near the moon's surface is roughly that. For example, the actual first cosmic velocity for the moon is about 1.7 km/s, so this checks out.\n\nNow, option C: T = 2π√(R/g). Let's compute that.\n\nR ≈ 1.737e6 m, g ≈ 1.62 m/s².\n\n√(R/g) = sqrt(1.737e6 / 1.62) ≈ sqrt(1.072e6) ≈ 1035 seconds.\n\nMultiply by 2π: ≈ 6506 seconds. Which is about 1.8 hours. The actual orbital period for a low lunar orbit is about 2 hours, so this is in the ballpark. For example, the Apollo command modules orbited the moon roughly every 2 hours. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nTherefore, both A and C are correct. Hence, the correct options are A and C. However, looking back at the original options, if the problem expects multiple correct answers, then the answer is A and C. If the original question is from a source where multiple answers are possible, then that's the case. However, in some cases, maybe the options are designed to have only one correct answer, but according to the physics, both A and C are correct.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. In many standardized tests, sometimes multiple options can be correct, but the way the question is presented here doesn't specify. However, since the user hasn't indicated any restrictions, and based on the calculations, both A and C are correct. However, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user wrote \"the spacecraft's ( ) Options: (A)... (D)... Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\" So likely, they expect multiple answers. In Chinese exams, sometimes they have multiple correct answers and you have to select all that apply.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and C. However, looking at the options, maybe the original question had different intentions. For example, if there's a mistake in the problem, or if I made a mistake. But given the thorough checking, I think A and C are correct.\n\nBut let me check once more for option B. Option B says angular velocity ω = sqrt(gR). If I compute ω using the numbers above, ω = 2π / T ≈ 2π / 6506 ≈ 0.000965 rad/s. Let me compute sqrt(gR): sqrt(1.62 * 1.737e6) ≈ sqrt(2.817e6) ≈ 1678 rad/s. Which is way off from the actual angular velocity. Therefore, option B is clearly wrong. So no issue there.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C. However, looking at the original options again, maybe there's a typo or something. But according to the analysis, A and C are correct. Therefore, the answer should be A and C. However, if the original problem expects only one correct answer, but given the math, there are two, maybe there's an error in the problem's options. But based on the information given, I have to go with A and C.\n\nBut wait, the original question might be from a source where only one option is correct. Let me check if there's any other way. For example, maybe the question is from the Chinese Gaokao or another exam where only one answer is correct. In that case, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the spacecraft's ( )\", and the options are about linear velocity, angular velocity, orbital period, and centripetal acceleration. In some cases, maybe only one of them is derivable without using g. For example, option A uses G, M, R, while option C uses g and R. Since the problem gives both G, M, R and also g, both expressions are valid. Hence, both A and C are correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answers are options A and C. However, since the user is asking for the answer in the format \"Answer: From A to D, we should choose...\", and if the original problem allows multiple answers, then the answer is A and C. But if the system requires a single answer, maybe there's a mistake. However, based on the calculations, both are correct.\n\nBut looking at the options again, in some textbooks, for example, the orbital speed is given by sqrt(GM/R), which is option A, and the period is given by 2π√(R³/(GM)), which using g = GM/R² becomes 2π√(R/g). So both are correct. Therefore, the answer should include both A and C.\n\nHowever, the problem might be designed so that only one is correct. But given the analysis, I think both are correct. Hence, I will conclude that options A and C are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe correct options are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>"}
