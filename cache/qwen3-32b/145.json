Karla drove 12,000 miles last year. The question is asking how many gallons of gasoline she would have saved if she had driven a hybrid car that gets 48 miles per gallon instead of her SUV that only gets 15 miles per gallon. Hmm, so I need to figure out the difference in gasoline consumption between the two vehicles over the same distance.\n\nFirst, maybe I should calculate how many gallons the SUV used. If the SUV averages 15 miles per gallon, then for every gallon, she can drive 15 miles. So to find out how many gallons she used for 12,000 miles, I need to divide the total miles by the miles per gallon. That makes sense because if you divide miles by miles per gallon, the units should cancel out to give gallons. Let me write that down:\n\nGallons used by SUV = Total miles / SUV's miles per gallon = 12,000 / 15.\n\nLet me compute that. 12,000 divided by 15. Hmm, 15 times 800 is 12,000, right? Because 15 times 100 is 1,500, so 15 times 800 would be 1,500 times 8, which is 12,000. So that would be 800 gallons. Okay, so the SUV used 800 gallons.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the hybrid car. The hybrid averages 48 miles per gallon. So again, gallons used by hybrid = Total miles / hybrid's miles per gallon = 12,000 / 48.\n\nHmm, let me calculate 12,000 divided by 48. Maybe I can simplify this. Let's see, 48 times 200 is 9,600. Then 12,000 minus 9,600 is 2,400. Then 48 times 50 is 2,400. So 200 + 50 is 250. So 48 times 250 is 12,000. Therefore, 12,000 divided by 48 is 250. So the hybrid car would use 250 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the difference in gasoline usage is the SUV's 800 gallons minus the hybrid's 250 gallons. Let me subtract those: 800 - 250 = 550. So she would have saved 550 gallons of gasoline.\n\nWait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, SUV: 12,000 divided by 15. 15 times 800 is indeed 12,000, so that's correct. Hybrid: 12,000 divided by 48. Let me do that division another way. 48 goes into 12,000 how many times? Let's divide numerator and denominator by 12 first. 12,000 divided by 12 is 1,000. 48 divided by 12 is 4. So now it's 1,000 divided by 4, which is 250. Yep, that checks out. So 250 gallons for the hybrid. Then 800 - 250 is 550. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the amount saved is the difference in fuel consumption. So maybe another way to calculate it is to find out how much more efficient the hybrid is compared to the SUV and then calculate the savings based on that. But maybe that's complicating it. The straightforward way is to calculate both fuel consumptions and subtract. Which is what I did. So I think the answer is 550 gallons saved.\n\nBut let me think again if I have the right approach. The question is about how many gallons she would have saved by driving the hybrid instead of the SUV. So yes, the savings is the amount of gas the SUV used minus the amount the hybrid used. So 800 - 250 = 550. That seems correct. \n\nWait, another way to check is to compute the fuel efficiency difference. But fuel efficiency is miles per gallon, so it's not a straightforward subtraction. Maybe using rates. Let me think. For each mile driven, the amount of gas used is 1/MPG. So the difference in gas per mile would be (1/15 - 1/48) gallons per mile. Then multiply by total miles to get total savings. Let's try that.\n\nCompute 1/15 - 1/48. To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 15 and 48. Let's see, factors of 15 are 3*5, and 48 is 16*3. So LCM would be 16*3*5 = 240. So converting both fractions:\n\n1/15 = 16/240\n\n1/48 = 5/240\n\nSo difference is 16/240 - 5/240 = 11/240 gallons per mile.\n\nThen total savings is 11/240 * 12,000 miles.\n\nCalculate that: 11/240 * 12,000. Let's divide 12,000 by 240 first. 240 * 50 = 12,000. So 12,000 / 240 = 50. Then multiply by 11: 50 * 11 = 550. So same answer. Therefore, 550 gallons. So that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 550 gallons saved.\n\n**Final Answer**\nKarla would have saved \\boxed{550} gallons of gasoline last year.\n</think>"}
