Hmm, let's see. Balancing chemical equations can be tricky, especially when there are multiple elements involved. I remember that the goal is to have the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the elements involved. On the left side, we have arsenic (As), sulfur (S), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O). On the right side, we have the same elements plus oxygen from the products. Wait, the products are H₃AsO₄, H₂SO₂, NO₂, and H₂O. Let me check each element:\n\n- Arsenic (As): 2 in As₂S₅ on the left, 1 in H₃AsO₄ on the right.\n- Sulfur (S): 5 in As₂S₅ on the left, 1 in H₂SO₂ on the right.\n- Nitrogen (N): 1 in HNO₃ on the left, 1 in NO₂ on the right.\n- Hydrogen (H): 1 in HNO₃ on the left, and in the products: 3 in H₃AsO₄, 2 in H₂SO₂, 2 in H₂O. So total H on the right is 3 + 2 + 2 = 7? Wait, maybe I need to count more carefully.\n- Oxygen (O): In HNO₃, there are 3 O's per molecule. On the right, H₃AsO₄ has 4 O's, H₂SO₂ has 2 O's, NO₂ has 2 O's, and H₂O has 1 O. So total O's on the right would be 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 per molecule? But there are multiple molecules here, so I need to balance coefficients.\n\nThis looks complicated because of the multiple elements. Maybe I should use the oxidation number method since there's a redox reaction here. Let me check oxidation states.\n\nLooking at the reactants and products:\n\nIn As₂S₅: Arsenic is likely in a lower oxidation state. Let's see. Sulfur in sulfides is usually -2. So for As₂S₅, the total charge is 0. Let's calculate As's oxidation state. Let x be the oxidation state of As. Then 2x + 5(-2) = 0 → 2x -10 = 0 → x = +5. Wait, but that's the same as in H₃AsO₄? Wait, in H₃AsO₄, As is +5. So maybe As isn't being oxidized here. Wait, but S in As₂S₅ is -2, and in H₂SO₂, sulfur is in what oxidation state? H₂SO₂... Let's see. Each H is +1, O is -2. So 2(+1) + S + 2(-2) = 0 → 2 + S -4 = 0 → S -2 = 0 → S is +2. So sulfur goes from -2 to +2. That's oxidation. So S is oxidized. \n\nWhat about HNO₃? Nitrogen in HNO₃ is +5. In NO₂, it's +4. So nitrogen is reduced from +5 to +4. So this is a redox reaction where S is oxidized and N is reduced.\n\nSo to balance this, I need to balance the electrons transferred. Let's start with the oxidation of sulfur. Each S atom goes from -2 to +2, which is a loss of 4 electrons per S atom. Since there are 5 S atoms in As₂S₅, total electrons lost would be 5 * 4 = 20 electrons.\n\nFor the reduction of nitrogen: Each N atom goes from +5 to +4, gaining 1 electron. Let's say there are 'n' NO₂ molecules produced, so total electrons gained would be n * 1. \n\nTo balance electrons, 20 electrons lost must equal electrons gained. So n = 20. Therefore, there must be 20 NO₂ molecules. \n\nNow, let's start assigning coefficients. Let me denote coefficients as A, B, C, D, E, F for As₂S₅, HNO₃, H₃AsO₄, H₂SO₂, NO₂, H₂O respectively.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\nA As₂S₅ + B HNO₃ → C H₃AsO₄ + D H₂SO₂ + E NO₂ + F H₂O\n\nFrom the electron balance, we have E = 20 (since each NO₂ gets 1 electron, and total electrons lost is 20). Wait, but actually, the number of NO₂ molecules is equal to the number of electrons gained. Since each NO₂ corresponds to 1 electron gained, and total electrons lost is 20, then E = 20. So E = 20.\n\nNow, let's handle the sulfur oxidation. Each S atom in As₂S₅ is oxidized to H₂SO₂. Since there are 5 S atoms in As₂S₅, we need 5 H₂SO₂ molecules. So D = 5.\n\nSimilarly, arsenic in As₂S₅ is in +5 oxidation state (as calculated earlier), and in H₃AsO₄, As is also +5. So As is not changing oxidation state. Therefore, the As in As₂S₅ is converted directly to H₃AsO₄. Since there are 2 As atoms in As₂S₅, we need 2 H₃AsO₄ molecules. So C = 2.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\nA As₂S₅ + B HNO₃ → 2 H₃AsO₄ + 5 H₂SO₂ + 20 NO₂ + F H₂O\n\nNow, let's determine A. Since there are 2 As atoms in As₂S₅ and 2 H₃AsO₄, A must be 1. So A = 1.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nAs₂S₅ + B HNO₃ → 2 H₃AsO₄ + 5 H₂SO₂ + 20 NO₂ + F H₂O\n\nNow, let's balance the other elements. Let's start with hydrogen and oxygen, which might be tricky.\n\nFirst, let's count the elements on both sides.\n\nLeft side (reactants):\n\n- As: 2\n- S: 5\n- H: B (from HNO₃)\n- N: B (from HNO₃)\n- O: 3B (from HNO₃)\n\nRight side (products):\n\n- As: 2 (from 2 H₃AsO₄)\n- S: 5 (from 5 H₂SO₂)\n- H: 2*3 (from 2 H₃AsO₄) + 5*2 (from 5 H₂SO₂) + F*2 (from F H₂O) = 6 + 10 + 2F = 16 + 2F\n- N: 20 (from 20 NO₂)\n- O: 2*4 (from 2 H₃AsO₄) + 5*2 (from 5 H₂SO₂) + 20*2 (from 20 NO₂) + F*1 (from F H₂O) = 8 + 10 + 40 + F = 58 + F\n\nNow, let's balance hydrogen and nitrogen first.\n\nFor nitrogen: On the left, we have B N atoms (from HNO₃), and on the right, 20 N atoms (from NO₂). Therefore, B = 20. Wait, but earlier I thought E = 20 (NO₂), and from the electron balance, E should be 20. So if B is the coefficient for HNO₃, and since each HNO₃ has 1 N, then B = 20. Let me check that again.\n\nYes, because each HNO₃ contributes 1 N atom, and there are 20 NO₂ molecules, each with 1 N. Therefore, B = 20. So B is 20.\n\nSo now, HNO₃ coefficient is 20. Let's update the equation:\n\nAs₂S₅ + 20 HNO₃ → 2 H₃AsO₄ + 5 H₂SO₂ + 20 NO₂ + F H₂O\n\nNow, let's check hydrogen. On the left, H comes from 20 HNO₃, which is 20 H atoms. On the right, H is from 2 H₃AsO₄ (6 H), 5 H₂SO₂ (10 H), and F H₂O (2F H). So total H on the right is 6 + 10 + 2F = 16 + 2F. Therefore, setting left H equal to right H:\n\n20 = 16 + 2F → 2F = 4 → F = 2. So F = 2. Therefore, the coefficient for H₂O is 2.\n\nNow, let's check oxygen. On the left, oxygen comes from 20 HNO₃, which is 20 * 3 = 60 O atoms. On the right, oxygen is in H₃AsO₄ (each has 4 O, 2 molecules → 8 O), H₂SO₂ (each has 2 O, 5 molecules → 10 O), NO₂ (each has 2 O, 20 molecules → 40 O), and H₂O (each has 1 O, 2 molecules → 2 O). Total O on the right is 8 + 10 + 40 + 2 = 60 O. Which matches the left side (60 O). Perfect, oxygen is balanced.\n\nLet me double-check all elements:\n\nArsenic: 2 on left (As₂S₅) and 2 on right (2 H₃AsO₄). Good.\n\nSulfur: 5 on left (As₂S₅) and 5 on right (5 H₂SO₂). Good.\n\nHydrogen: Left is 20 (from 20 HNO₃). Right is 6 (from 2 H₃AsO₄) + 10 (from 5 H₂SO₂) + 4 (from 2 H₂O) = 20. Good.\n\nNitrogen: 20 on left (20 HNO₃) and 20 on right (20 NO₂). Good.\n\nOxygen: 60 on left (20*3) and 60 on right (8+10+40+2). Good.\n\nSo all elements are balanced. Therefore, the balanced equation is:\n\nAs₂S₅ + 20 HNO₃ → 2 H₃AsO₄ + 5 H₂SO₂ + 20 NO₂ + 2 H₂O\n\nWait, but let me check the coefficients again. The problem is that sometimes when balancing redox reactions, there might be an issue with the coefficients, but in this case, everything seems to check out. Let me just verify once more.\n\nLeft side:\n\n- As₂S₅: 1 molecule → 2 As, 5 S\n- 20 HNO₃: 20 H, 20 N, 60 O\n\nRight side:\n\n- 2 H₃AsO₄: 2*3=6 H, 2 As, 2*4=8 O\n- 5 H₂SO₂: 5*2=10 H, 5 S, 5*2=10 O\n- 20 NO₂: 20 N, 20*2=40 O\n- 2 H₂O: 2*2=4 H, 2 O\n\nTotal H on right: 6 + 10 + 4 = 20. Correct.\n\nTotal As: 2. Correct.\n\nTotal S: 5. Correct.\n\nTotal N: 20. Correct.\n\nTotal O: 8 + 10 + 40 + 2 = 60. Correct.\n\nYes, everything is balanced. Therefore, the balanced equation is as above.\n</think>"}
