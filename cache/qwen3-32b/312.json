Let me start by recalling what I know about spontaneous reactions. I remember that spontaneity in chemistry is related to Gibbs free energy. The formula is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. If ΔG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. But wait, the question is about standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), right? So maybe I should think about the standard conditions.\n\nThe question gives four options. Let me go through each one.\n\nOption A: At equilibrium there are more products than reactants. Hmm. If there are more products at equilibrium, that means the reaction favors products. But does that mean the reaction is spontaneous? I think the position of equilibrium is related to the equilibrium constant, Keq. If Keq is greater than 1, products are favored. But how does that relate to spontaneity? Well, if a reaction is spontaneous, it proceeds towards products, but equilibrium is when the reaction stops. Wait, but if at equilibrium there are more products, maybe the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions? Not sure. Let me think more.\n\nOption B: The value of ΔG° is greater than zero. If ΔG° is positive, that would mean the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions. Because a negative ΔG° indicates spontaneity. So B would be incorrect.\n\nOption C: The value of ΔS° is greater than zero. A positive entropy change might contribute to a negative ΔG, especially if the temperature is high. But ΔS° alone isn't enough to determine spontaneity. Because ΔG also depends on ΔH and temperature. So even if entropy increases, if the enthalpy is very positive, the reaction might not be spontaneous. So C isn't necessarily correct.\n\nOption D: The value of Keq is less than one. If Keq is less than one, that means reactants are favored at equilibrium. So the reaction doesn't proceed much towards products. If Keq is less than one, then using the equation ΔG° = -RT ln Keq, if Keq is less than one, ln Keq would be negative, so ΔG° would be positive. Which means the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions. So D would indicate non-spontaneity, not spontaneity.\n\nSo going back to Option A. If at equilibrium there are more products than reactants, that means Keq is greater than one. Which would mean ΔG° is negative (since ln Keq would be positive, making ΔG° negative). A negative ΔG° indicates a spontaneous reaction under standard conditions. So A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"at equilibrium there are more products than reactants\". At equilibrium, the reaction isn't spontaneous anymore; it's at equilibrium. But maybe the question is implying that under standard conditions, the reaction is spontaneous, leading to more products at equilibrium. So the fact that at equilibrium there are more products suggests that the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions. So A would be correct.\n\nLet me verify. The standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) relates to the equilibrium constant by ΔG° = -RT ln Keq. If Keq > 1, then ln Keq is positive, so ΔG° is negative, which means the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions. Therefore, if at equilibrium there are more products (Keq > 1), then ΔG° is negative, so the reaction is spontaneous. So Option A is correct.\n\nOptions B, C, D don't indicate spontaneity. B is non-spontaneous, C is just entropy, which isn't sufficient, D is Keq < 1, which is non-spontaneous. So the answer should be A.\n</think>"}
