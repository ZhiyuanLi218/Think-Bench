So, there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. The problem gives some reactions and properties of these compounds, and we need to find the molecular weight range of A4.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given information step by step.\n\n1. **A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (which has 31.96% fluorine) and fluorine gas.**\n2. **A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.**\n3. **A3 can also interact with xenon.**\n4. **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.**\n5. **Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 gives A5.**\n6. **A5 decomposes in water into two substances.**\n7. **We need to find the molecular weight range of A4.**\n\nAlright, so first, since all compounds are binary with fluorine and Y, let's think about possible elements Y. The fact that they form multiple fluorides and some can oxidize xenon (which is generally inert) suggests that Y is a highly electronegative element, maybe a halogen or something like oxygen? But xenon is oxidized by A1 and A3, so maybe Y is a very strong oxidizer. Wait, but Y is part of the compounds. Let me think.\n\nXenon is usually oxidized by strong oxidizing agents like fluorine, oxygen, or other highly electronegative elements. Since A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon, maybe Y is fluorine? But fluorine is already part of the compounds. Wait, but the problem says element Y forms binary compounds with fluorine. So Y is another element. So Y could be oxygen? Let me check.\n\nWait, oxygen can form OF2, which is a known compound. But does OF2 oxidize xenon? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine or another halogen? But chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc. But if Y is chlorine, then the compounds would be ClFx. However, chlorine itself is less electronegative than fluorine, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe Y is a noble gas? But the problem says element Y forms compounds with fluorine, and we have xenon being oxidized by some of these compounds. Maybe Y is oxygen?\n\nWait, let's consider oxygen. Oxygen can form O2F2 (dioxygen difluoride), which is a strong oxidizing agent. It's known to react with xenon. For example, XeF4 can be formed by the reaction of xenon with fluorine, but maybe O2F2 can oxidize xenon as well. Also, O2F2 decomposes into O2 and F2. Let me check the percentage of fluorine in O2F2.\n\nThe molar mass of O2F2 is 32 + 38 = 70 g/mol. The mass of fluorine is 38 g/mol. So the percentage is 38/70 ≈ 54.29%, which is higher than 31.96%. Hmm, but A2 has 31.96% fluorine. So maybe not O2F2.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about other fluorides. Let's consider Y as a metal? But metals usually form ionic fluorides. However, the problem mentions decomposition into A2 and F2. If A1 is a metal fluoride, maybe it's something like MFx, but decomposing into another fluoride and F2. Let me think.\n\nBut the fact that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions suggests that Y is a strong oxidizing agent. So maybe Y is oxygen, nitrogen, or another non-metal. Let me try oxygen again. Let's think of other oxygen fluorides. There's also OF2 (oxygen difluoride). Let's check the fluorine percentage here. Molar mass of OF2 is 16 + 38 = 54 g/mol. Fluorine mass is 38 g/mol. So 38/54 ≈ 70.37%, still higher than 31.96%. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe Y is a different element. Let's think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Suppose A1 is YFx, and upon decomposition, it becomes YFy and F2. The fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%. Let's denote A2 as YFy. The percentage of fluorine in YFy is (y * 19) / (M_Y + y * 19) = 0.3196.\n\nSo, solving for M_Y:\n\nLet me write the equation:\n\n(y * 19) / (M_Y + y * 19) = 0.3196\n\nWhich rearranges to:\n\ny * 19 = 0.3196 * (M_Y + y * 19)\n\nLet me solve for M_Y:\n\ny * 19 = 0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * y * 19\n\nBring terms with y to left:\n\ny * 19 - 0.3196 * y * 19 = 0.3196 * M_Y\n\nFactor out y * 19:\n\ny * 19 (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 * M_Y\n\nCalculate 1 - 0.3196 = 0.6804\n\nSo:\n\ny * 19 * 0.6804 = 0.3196 * M_Y\n\nThen:\n\nM_Y = [y * 19 * 0.6804] / 0.3196 ≈ [y * 19 * 2.129] ≈ y * 19 * 2.129\n\nLet me compute 19 * 2.129 ≈ 40.45. So:\n\nM_Y ≈ y * 40.45\n\nSo possible values of y (since it's a fluorine index in a compound) could be 1, 2, 3, etc. Let's see what M_Y would be for different y:\n\nIf y=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol. What element is that? Calcium is 40.08, so close. Maybe Y is calcium? But calcium is a metal, and if A2 is CaF, which is not common. CaF2 is common. But here y=1. Maybe not. Let's check other y.\n\nIf y=2: M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 2 ≈ 80.9 g/mol. What element is around 80.9? Bromine is 79.9, so close. But bromine is a halogen. If Y is bromine, then A2 would be BrF2. But bromine typically forms BrF3, BrF5, etc. BrF2 might not be stable. Hmm.\n\nIf y=3: M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 3 ≈ 121.35 g/mol. That's close to Iodine (126.90), but a bit lower. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe another element.\n\nWait, let's check for possible elements. If y=2 and M_Y≈80.9, which is close to Br. Let's check the fluorine percentage in BrF2.\n\nMolar mass of BrF2 is 79.9 + 2*19 = 79.9 + 38 = 117.9 g/mol. Fluorine mass is 38 g/mol. So 38/117.9 ≈ 32.22%. The given percentage is 31.96%, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to rounding. So maybe Y is bromine, and A2 is BrF2. But wait, BrF2 is not a stable compound. The common bromine fluorides are BrF3 and BrF5. BrF is also known but less stable. BrF2 might not be a common compound. Hmm. Maybe the calculation is leading us to BrF2 as A2, but is that possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Y is another element. Let's check if there's another element with M_Y ≈ 80.9. Let's see:\n\n- Bromine is 79.9\n- Rubidium is 85.47\n- Strontium is 87.62\n- Krypton is 83.80\n- Molybdenum is much higher.\n\nSo the closest is bromine. Maybe the problem is using approximate atomic masses. Let's accept that Y is bromine, and A2 is BrF2, which has a fluorine percentage of ~32.22%, close to the given 31.96%. The slight discrepancy could be due to more precise atomic masses. Let me check with exact values.\n\nAtomic mass of Br is 79.904 g/mol, F is 18.998 g/mol.\n\nSo for BrF2:\n\nMass of F = 2 * 18.998 = 37.996 g/mol\n\nTotal mass = 79.904 + 37.996 = 117.9 g/mol\n\nPercentage F = (37.996 / 117.9) * 100 ≈ 32.24%. The problem states 31.96%, which is about 0.28% less. Maybe the actual compound is BrF with some impurities or maybe another compound. Alternatively, perhaps Y is not bromine. Let me check another possibility.\n\nWait, if Y is chlorine? Let's try y=3.\n\nIf Y is chlorine, M_Y ≈ 35.45 g/mol. Let's see if there's a y that gives M_Y ≈ 35.45.\n\nFrom earlier equation:\n\nM_Y ≈ y * 40.45\n\nSo solving for y:\n\ny ≈ M_Y / 40.45 ≈ 35.45 / 40.45 ≈ 0.876. Not a whole number. Not possible.\n\nIf Y is fluorine itself? Then M_Y is 19 g/mol. Let's see:\n\nIf Y is F, then A2 would be FxFy? Wait, but Y is fluorine, and the compounds are binary with fluorine. So if Y is fluorine, then the compounds would be F-F, which is just F2. But that doesn't make sense. So probably not.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe Y is astatine? No, atomic mass would be higher. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculation is for A1 decomposing into A2 and F2. Suppose A1 is YFz, and decomposes into YFx (A2) and F2. Let's assume that the decomposition is something like YFz → YFx + (z - x)/2 F2.\n\nBut the fluorine percentage in A2 is given. If A2 is YFx, then the percentage of F is [x * 19]/(M_Y + x * 19) = 0.3196.\n\nEarlier calculation led us to M_Y ≈ y * 40.45 where y is the number of F in A2. If we take y=2, M_Y ≈ 80.9, which is close to Br. Let's tentatively accept Y is Br, A2 is BrF2, and proceed.\n\nNow, A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So if A2 is BrF2, then A1 could be a higher fluoride of Br, like BrF3 or BrF5. Let's check. If A1 is BrF3, decomposing into BrF2 and F2. But BrF3 decomposition might not produce BrF2. Alternatively, maybe A1 is BrF5 decomposing into BrF3 and F2? But the fluorine percentage in BrF3 would be [3*19]/(79.9 + 3*19) = 57/(79.9+57)=57/136.9≈41.6%, which is higher than 31.96%. If A2 is BrF2, then A1 must be BrF3 decomposing to BrF2 and F2? But I need to check if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A1 is BrF, decomposing into BrF2? No, that would require adding F. Decomposition usually breaks down into simpler compounds. So maybe A1 is BrF3 decomposing into BrF (A2) and F2. Let's check fluorine percentage in BrF.\n\nFor BrF: F mass is 19, total mass is 79.9 + 19 = 98.9 g/mol. Percentage F is 19/98.9 ≈ 19.2%, which is lower than 31.96%. So not matching. Therefore, if A2 is BrF2 with 32.24% F, and A1 is BrF3 decomposing into BrF2 and F2, then that's possible. Let's check the fluorine percentage in A2. As calculated, it's about 32.24%, close to the given 31.96%. The difference might be due to more precise atomic masses or rounding in the problem.\n\nSo tentatively, let's assume Y is bromine. Then the five compounds of Br with F would be BrF, BrF3, BrF5, maybe others. The problem says five binary compounds. Indeed, bromine forms BrF, BrF3, BrF5, and maybe others under certain conditions, but typically three are well-known. However, the problem states five, so maybe there are more. Anyway, proceeding.\n\nNow, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is usually oxidized by strong fluorinating agents. BrF3 is a strong fluorinating agent. For example, BrF3 can react with xenon to form XeF4. So if A1 is BrF3, which can oxidize xenon, that fits. Then A1 decomposes into A2 (BrF2?) and F2. But I'm not sure if BrF2 is a stable compound. However, given the percentage, it's the closest fit. Alternatively, maybe A2 is BrF3 and A1 is BrF5? Let me check.\n\nIf A2 is BrF3, then fluorine percentage is 57/136.9 ≈ 41.6%, which is higher than given. So no. Therefore, the earlier assumption that A2 is BrF2 with Y=Br is the best fit.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let's consider another approach. Let's think about the fluorine percentage again. Suppose A2 is YF4. Then:\n\nPercentage F = (4*19)/(M_Y + 4*19) = 76/(M_Y + 76) = 0.3196.\n\nSolving:\n\n76 = 0.3196*(M_Y + 76)\n\nM_Y + 76 = 76 / 0.3196 ≈ 237.84\n\nM_Y ≈ 237.84 - 76 ≈ 161.84 g/mol. What element has atomic mass ~162? Lanthanum is 138.9, Cerium is 140.1, Praseodymium 140.9, Neodymium 144.2, Promethium 145, Samarium 150.36, Europium 151.96, Gadolinium 157.25, Terbium 158.93, Dysprosium 162.50. Ah, Dysprosium is about 162.5 g/mol. So if Y is Dysprosium (Dy), then DyF4 would have fluorine percentage:\n\nMolar mass of DyF4: 162.5 + 4*19 = 162.5 + 76 = 238.5 g/mol\n\nFluorine mass: 76 g/mol\n\nPercentage: 76 / 238.5 ≈ 0.3186 or 31.86%, which is very close to the given 31.96%. The difference is about 0.1%, which could be due to rounding. So this is a better fit. So maybe Y is Dysprosium?\n\nBut Dysprosium is a lanthanide, and it's less likely to form multiple fluorides. However, lanthanides do form MF3, but MF4? Maybe not commonly. Wait, but some lanthanides can have +4 oxidation states. For example, Cerium can form CeF4. Similarly, maybe Dysprosium can form DyF4. If that's the case, then A2 is DyF4, with 31.86% F. Then A1 would be a higher fluoride, like DyF5, decomposing into DyF4 and F2. Let's check the fluorine percentage in DyF5:\n\nMolar mass of DyF5: 162.5 + 5*19 = 162.5 + 95 = 257.5 g/mol\n\nFluorine mass: 95 g/mol\n\nPercentage F: 95 / 257.5 ≈ 36.89%. But the problem says A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. If A1 is DyF5, decomposing into DyF4 and F2, then the fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.86%, which matches. So this seems plausible. And Dysprosium is a lanthanide, which can form various fluorides. However, the problem mentions that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is usually oxidized by strong fluorinating agents like F2, BrF3, etc. If A1 is DyF5, would it oxidize xenon? I'm not sure. Lanthanide fluorides are typically ionic and not strong fluorinating agents. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Y is a non-metal. Let's see. If Y is a non-metal that forms multiple fluorides and can oxidize xenon. Let's go back to the previous idea where Y is bromine. Even though BrF2 is not common, the percentage fits. Let's consider that.\n\nSo if Y is Br, A2 is BrF2 with ~32.24% F, close to 31.96%. Then A1 could be BrF3 decomposing into BrF2 and F2. BrF3 is a known compound and is a strong fluorinating agent, which could oxidize xenon. For example, BrF3 reacts with Xe to form XeF4. So that fits the description of A1 oxidizing xenon under normal conditions. Also, A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Br) with F2, so maybe A3 is another fluoride like BrF5. BrF5 can also react with xenon to form XeF6, perhaps. So A3 could be BrF5. Then the five compounds would be BrF, BrF3, BrF5, maybe others like BrF2 and BrF4? Wait, BrF4 is not a common compound. But the problem says five binary compounds. Let's see: BrF, BrF3, BrF5, BrF2 (if it exists), and maybe another one. But I'm not sure about BrF2. However, given the decomposition data, maybe the problem is considering BrF3 as A1 decomposing into BrF2 (A2) and F2.\n\nSo proceeding with Y as bromine.\n\nNow, moving to the next part: A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y with fluorine. If Y is Br, then A3 could be BrF3 or BrF5. Since A3 can also interact with xenon, which is oxidized, perhaps A3 is BrF5. BrF5 is a stronger fluorinating agent than BrF3, so maybe it's more likely to react with xenon.\n\nNext: By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances.\n\nSo, adding Y (Br) to A4 in 1:1 ratio gives A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Let's think about possible reactions.\n\nIf A4 is a fluoride of Br, and adding Br to it... For example, if A4 is a lower fluoride, adding Br could produce a higher fluoride. For example, if A4 is BrF, adding Br would give BrF3? But the molar ratio is 1:1. Let me think of a reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a fluoride in some solvent, but the problem says it's a concentrated solution. Wait, the problem says \"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". If A4 is a fluoride, maybe it's dissolved in anhydrous HF or something. For example, BrF3 can dissolve in anhydrous HF. If we add Br to BrF3 solution, maybe we get BrF5? The reaction would be something like Br + BrF3 → BrF5? Let's check stoichiometry. Suppose:\n\nBr + BrF3 → 2 BrF2? No, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nBr2 + 5 F2 → 2 BrF5. But that's synthesis from elements. If we have a solution of BrF3 and add Br, perhaps:\n\nBr + 3 BrF3 → 4 BrF3? No. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nBr + BrF3 → 2 BrF2? But again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is:\n\nBr + A4 → A5, with 1:1 ratio. If A4 is BrF, adding Br would give Br2 + F? No. If A4 is BrF3, adding Br might give BrF4? But I'm not sure about the reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A4 is a fluoride of Br with lower oxidation state, and adding Br (element) reduces it? Not sure. Let's think differently. Since A5 decomposes in water into two substances. For example, if A5 is BrF3, then in water it hydrolyzes to HBrO3 and HF. Or if A5 is BrF5, it hydrolyzes to HBrO4 and HF. But the problem says \"two substances\", which could be an acid and HF. Let me check.\n\nBrF3 hydrolysis: 3 H2O + BrF3 → HBrO3 + 3 HF. So two products: HBrO3 and HF. So that's two substances. Similarly, BrF5 hydrolysis: H2O + BrF5 → HBrO3 + 5 HF. Wait, but that would be HBrO3 and HF. But maybe another product? Or maybe HBrO4? Let me check. The hydrolysis of BrF5 is more complex, but under certain conditions, it can form HBrO3 and HF. So maybe A5 is BrF3 or BrF5.\n\nIf A5 is BrF3, then the reaction to form it would be adding Br to A4. Suppose A4 is BrF. Adding Br to BrF in a 1:1 ratio:\n\nBr + BrF → Br2 + F? No. Not likely. Alternatively, maybe in solution, some reaction. If A4 is BrF, and adding Br (element) in 1:1 molar ratio, perhaps:\n\nBr + 3 BrF → BrF3 + Br2? Let me balance:\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have Br and BrF reacting. Let's say:\n\nBr + BrF → BrF2? Not sure. Alternatively, if we have a solution of BrF and add Br, maybe:\n\nBr + BrF → Br2 + F^-? But in a solution, maybe with HF? If A4 is BrF in anhydrous HF solution, adding Br might lead to some reaction. Alternatively, if A4 is BrF3 solution, and adding Br gives BrF5. But the molar ratio is 1:1. Let me try:\n\nBr + BrF3 → 2 BrF2? But BrF2 is not stable. Alternatively:\n\nBr + 5 BrF3 → 3 BrF5 + ... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A4 is a fluoride of Br with a lower oxidation state. For example, if A4 is BrF, adding Br (element) in 1:1 ratio could produce BrF2. But BrF2 is not stable. Alternatively, maybe A4 is BrF3, and adding Br gives BrF4? Not sure. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Y is not bromine but another element. Let's go back to the earlier possibility where Y is Dysprosium (Dy), with A2 being DyF4 (31.86% F). Then A1 would be DyF5 decomposing into DyF4 and F2. If A1 is DyF5, which can oxidize xenon. But DyF5 is an ionic compound, not a strong fluorinating agent. So it's unlikely to oxidize xenon. Therefore, this suggests that maybe Y is not Dy, and the earlier assumption of Y being Br is better, even with the slight fluorine percentage discrepancy.\n\nAssuming Y is Br, let's proceed. If A5 is BrF3, which decomposes into HBrO3 and HF when hydrolyzed. So how is A5 formed from adding Y (Br) to A4? Let's think of A4 as a solution of BrF in some solvent. If we add Br to BrF solution, perhaps we get BrF3? Let's write the reaction:\n\nBr (element) + 3 BrF → BrF3 + Br2? Let me check stoichiometry.\n\nLet me balance the equation. Suppose:\n\nBr2 + BrF → BrF3. Not sure. Alternatively, if we have Br (element) reacting with BrF:\n\nLet me consider the oxidation states. Br in BrF is +1 (since F is -1). Br element is 0. To form BrF3, Br would go from 0 to +3. So oxidation. Where is the reducing agent? Maybe the BrF is acting as an oxidizing agent? Not sure. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of HF and BrF, and adding Br leads to the formation of BrF3. For example, in anhydrous HF, BrF3 can be formed by reacting Br with BrF. But I'm not familiar with the exact reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A4 is a fluoride of Br with a lower oxidation state than A5. For example, if A4 is BrF and A5 is BrF3, then adding Br (element) to BrF solution could produce BrF3. The reaction might be:\n\nBr + 3 BrF → BrF3 + Br2. Let's check the stoichiometry. Let's say we have 1 mole of Br and 3 moles of BrF. The products would be BrF3 and Br2. Let's count the atoms:\n\nLeft side: 1 Br + 3 Br + 3 F = 4 Br and 3 F.\n\nRight side: 1 BrF3 (1 Br and 3 F) and 1 Br2 (2 Br). Total Br: 1 + 2 = 3. F: 3. But left side has 4 Br. So not balanced. Let me try balancing properly.\n\nLet me write the equation as:\n\na Br + b BrF → c BrF3 + d Br2\n\nBalancing Br:\n\na + b = c + 2d\n\nBalancing F:\n\nb = 3c\n\nLet me assume a = 1 (since the molar ratio is 1:1 for Y to A4). Wait, the problem says \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" So if A4 is BrF, then the molar ratio of Y (Br) to A4 (BrF) is 1:1. So a = 1, b = 1.\n\nThen:\n\nFrom F: 1 = 3c → c = 1/3.\n\nFrom Br: 1 + 1 = c + 2d → 2 = 1/3 + 2d → 2d = 2 - 1/3 = 5/3 → d = 5/6.\n\nThis gives fractional coefficients. To eliminate fractions, multiply all by 3:\n\n3 Br + 3 BrF → BrF3 + 5/2 Br2 → Hmm, messy. Maybe not a realistic reaction. Perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nMaybe A4 is BrF3 and adding Br gives BrF5? Let's try:\n\nBr + BrF3 → BrF5 + ... Let's balance:\n\nBr (element) + BrF3 → BrF5 + Br2?\n\nLeft side: 1 Br + 1 Br + 3 F = 2 Br and 3 F.\n\nRight side: BrF5 has 1 Br and 5 F, and Br2 has 2 Br. Total Br: 1 + 2 = 3. F: 5.\n\nBut left side has only 2 Br and 3 F. Not balanced. Let me try:\n\nLet me assume the reaction is:\n\nBr2 + 5 BrF3 → 6 BrF5 + ... No, not helpful.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that A5 is BrF5, which decomposes in water into HBrO3 and HF. If A5 is BrF5, then how is it formed by adding Br to A4 in 1:1 ratio. Suppose A4 is BrF3. Adding Br to BrF3 solution:\n\nBr + BrF3 → BrF5 + ... Let's balance:\n\nBr + BrF3 → BrF5 + Br (but that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, maybe:\n\nBr + 2 BrF3 → BrF5 + BrF? Let's see:\n\nBr + 2 BrF3 → BrF5 + BrF\n\nLeft side: 1 Br + 2 Br + 6 F = 3 Br and 6 F.\n\nRight side: 1 Br + 5 F (from BrF5) + 1 Br + 1 F (from BrF) → 2 Br and 6 F. Balanced! Yes. So the balanced equation is:\n\nBr + 2 BrF3 → BrF5 + BrF\n\nBut the problem says \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" So if Y is Br (1 mole), and A4 is BrF3 (2 moles), then the molar ratio of Y to A4 is 1:2, not 1:1. This doesn't match the given 1:1 ratio. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A4 is BrF, and adding Br in 1:1 gives BrF3. Let's try:\n\nBr + 3 BrF → BrF3 + ... Let's balance:\n\nBr + 3 BrF → BrF3 + 2 Br\n\nLeft side: 1 Br + 3 Br + 3 F = 4 Br, 3 F.\n\nRight side: 1 Br + 3 F + 2 Br = 3 Br and 3 F. Not balanced. Need more Br on the right.\n\nMaybe:\n\nBr + 3 BrF → BrF3 + Br2\n\nLeft side: 1 Br + 3 Br + 3 F = 4 Br, 3 F.\n\nRight side: 1 Br + 3 F + 2 Br = 3 Br, 3 F. Still missing 1 Br on the right. Not balanced.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the reaction isn't straightforward. Perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nIf A5 is BrF3, which decomposes into HBrO3 and HF, and A4 is BrF5. Adding Br to BrF5 in 1:1 ratio. Let's try:\n\nBr + BrF5 → ... Maybe reducing BrF5 to BrF3? Let's see:\n\nBr + BrF5 → 2 BrF3\n\nBalancing:\n\nBr + BrF5 → 2 BrF3\n\nLeft: 1 Br + 1 Br + 5 F = 2 Br, 5 F.\n\nRight: 2 Br + 6 F. Not balanced. Add F2?\n\nBr + BrF5 → 2 BrF3 + F2\n\nLeft: 2 Br, 5 F.\n\nRight: 2 Br + 6 F + 2 F = 2 Br, 8 F. No. Not balanced. This is not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A4 is a different compound. Let's think about the five compounds. If Y is Br, the five fluorides are BrF, BrF3, BrF5, BrF2 (if it exists), and maybe another one like BrF4? But BrF4 is not common. However, the problem states five compounds, so maybe they are BrF, BrF2, BrF3, BrF4, BrF5. If that's the case, then A4 could be BrF4, and adding Br in 1:1 ratio gives BrF5. Let's try:\n\nBr + BrF4 → BrF5 + ... Let's balance:\n\nBr + BrF4 → BrF5 + Br\n\nLeft: 1 Br + 1 Br + 4 F = 2 Br, 4 F.\n\nRight: 1 Br + 5 F + 1 Br = 2 Br, 5 F. Not balanced. Need to adjust.\n\nMaybe:\n\nBr + BrF4 → BrF5 + F2?\n\nLeft: 2 Br, 4 F.\n\nRight: 1 Br + 5 F + 2 F = 1 Br, 7 F. Not balanced.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe the reaction is different. Perhaps A4 is a solution of BrF3 in anhydrous HF, and adding Br leads to the formation of BrF5. For example, in HF solution, the reaction might be:\n\nBr + BrF3 + 2 HF → BrF5 + 2 H+ + 2 F^-\n\nBut this is speculative. The problem says \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" If A4 is BrF3 solution, and adding Br in 1:1 ratio, maybe the reaction is:\n\nBr + BrF3 → 2 BrF2? But BrF2 is not stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a redox reaction where Br is oxidized and BrF3 is reduced. This is getting too complicated without more information.\n\nLet's try to approach this from another angle. We need to find the molecular weight range of A4. The options are 160-180, 220-240, etc. Let's assume Y is Br and try to figure out what A4 could be.\n\nIf A5 is BrF3, which decomposes into HBrO3 and HF, then A4 could be BrF. Adding Br to BrF in 1:1 ratio. But earlier attempts to balance didn't work. Alternatively, if A5 is BrF5, then A4 could be BrF3, and adding Br in 1:1 ratio. Let's try:\n\nBr + BrF3 → BrF5 + ... Let's assume it produces BrF5 and some byproduct. If the reaction is:\n\nBr + BrF3 + F2 → 2 BrF5. But where does F2 come from? If A4 is in a solution where F2 is present, but the problem says adding Y (Br) to A4 solution.\n\nThis is too vague. Maybe I need to think about the molecular weights of possible A4 compounds.\n\nIf Y is Br, then possible A4 compounds could be BrF, BrF2, BrF3, BrF4, BrF5. Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n\n- BrF: 79.9 + 19 = 98.9 g/mol\n- BrF2: 79.9 + 2*19 = 117.9 g/mol\n- BrF3: 79.9 + 3*19 = 136.9 g/mol\n- BrF4: 79.9 + 4*19 = 155.9 g/mol\n- BrF5: 79.9 + 5*19 = 174.9 g/mol\n\nNow, the options for A4's molecular weight are:\n\nA: 160-180 (BrF5 is 174.9, which fits here)\n\nB: 220-240 (too high)\n\nC: 140-160 (BrF4 is 155.9, which fits here)\n\nD: 110-130 (BrF3 is 136.9, which is just above this range)\n\nSo if A4 is BrF5 (174.9 g/mol), it falls into option A (160-180). If A4 is BrF4 (155.9 g/mol), it falls into option C (140-160). If A4 is BrF3 (136.9 g/mol), it's near option D but slightly above.\n\nBut we need to determine which one it is. Let's think about the reaction to form A5. If adding Y (Br) to A4 gives A5, and A5 decomposes in water, let's consider possible scenarios.\n\nIf A4 is BrF3 (136.9 g/mol), and adding Br gives A5 which could be BrF5. But earlier balancing issues. If the reaction is possible, then A4 would be BrF3 (136.9 g/mol), which is near option D (110-130) but slightly above. However, option D is 110-130, and 136.9 is outside. So if A4 is BrF3, it doesn't fit any option. If A4 is BrF4 (155.9 g/mol), which is in option C (140-160). If adding Br to BrF4 gives BrF5, then the reaction might be:\n\nBr + BrF4 → BrF5 + ... Let's balance:\n\nBr + BrF4 → BrF5 + Br\n\nLeft: 2 Br, 4 F\n\nRight: 2 Br, 5 F. Not balanced. Need to add F2 on the left?\n\nBr + BrF4 + F2 → 2 BrF5\n\nBut this requires F2, which might not be present. Alternatively, in the solution, maybe HF is present, and the reaction is different.\n\nAlternatively, if A4 is BrF (98.9 g/mol), adding Br gives BrF3. Let's assume the reaction somehow works, and A5 is BrF3. Then A4's molecular weight is 98.9, which falls into option D (110-130) but is below it. So this doesn't fit.\n\nIf A4 is BrF5 (174.9 g/mol), adding Br gives something else? Not sure. But if A5 is formed by adding Br to A4, and A5 decomposes in water, maybe A5 is a higher fluoride. But adding Br to BrF5 would likely reduce it, not increase. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A4 is BrF2 (117.9 g/mol), adding Br gives BrF3. Let's try:\n\nBr + BrF2 → BrF3\n\nBalanced: 1 Br + 1 BrF2 → 1 BrF3 + 1 Br? No, that would be 2 Br + 1 F on the left, and 1 Br + 3 F + 1 Br on the right. Not balanced. Maybe:\n\nBr + BrF2 → BrF3\n\nBalancing F: 2 F on left, 3 F on right. Need to add F2 on the left:\n\nBr + BrF2 + F2 → 2 BrF3\n\nNow balanced: Br + BrF2 + F2 → 2 BrF3\n\nLeft: 1 Br + 1 Br + 2 F + 2 F = 2 Br, 4 F\n\nRight: 2 BrF3 = 2 Br + 6 F. Not balanced. Need more F on the left. This is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the options and the molecular weights, if A4 is BrF4 (155.9 g/mol), which is in option C (140-160), and assuming that adding Br to it gives BrF5, then this fits. Even if the exact reaction is unclear, the molecular weight range would be option C. Alternatively, if A4 is BrF3 (136.9 g/mol), which is just above option D, but since the options don't have a 130-150 range, maybe the correct answer is C.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA:160-180 (BrF5 is 174.9)\n\nB:220-240\n\nC:140-160 (BrF4 is 155.9)\n\nD:110-130 (BrF3 is 136.9, which is above)\n\nSo if A4 is BrF4, then C is correct. If A4 is BrF5, then A is correct. How to decide?\n\nLet's recall that A5 decomposes in water into two substances. If A5 is BrF3, then it decomposes into HBrO3 and HF. If A5 is BrF5, it decomposes into HBrO3 and HF as well, or maybe HBrO4 and HF. Either way, it's two substances. Now, if A5 is BrF3, then the reaction to form it would require A4 to be something. If A4 is BrF, adding Br gives BrF3. But the molecular weight of A4 (BrF) is 98.9, which is below option D. If A4 is BrF3, adding Br gives something else, but we don't know. If A4 is BrF4 (155.9), adding Br gives BrF5 (174.9), which is option A. But how is A5 formed?\n\nThe problem says \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" If Y is Br, and A4 is BrF4, then adding 1 mole of Br to 1 mole of BrF4 might give 1 mole of BrF5 and some other product. Let's try to balance:\n\nBr + BrF4 → BrF5 + ... Let's assume it produces BrF5 and another BrF compound. For example:\n\nBr + BrF4 → BrF5 + BrF\n\nBalancing:\n\nLeft: 1 Br + 1 Br + 4 F = 2 Br, 4 F.\n\nRight: 1 Br + 5 F (BrF5) + 1 Br + 1 F (BrF) = 2 Br, 6 F. Not balanced. Need to add F2 on the left:\n\nBr + BrF4 + F2 → BrF5 + BrF\n\nNow left: 2 Br, 4 F + 2 F = 2 Br, 6 F.\n\nRight: 2 Br, 6 F. Balanced! So the reaction is:\n\nBr + BrF4 + F2 → BrF5 + BrF\n\nBut this requires F2 to be present in the solution. If the solution of A4 (BrF4) is in an environment where F2 is present, this could work. However, the problem states that we're adding Y (Br) to the solution, not F2. This is speculative, but if we assume this reaction, then A4 is BrF4 (155.9 g/mol), which falls into option C (140-160).\n\nAlternatively, if A4 is BrF3 (136.9 g/mol), and adding Br gives BrF5, requiring additional F2, which might be present in the solution. But the molar ratio of Y to A4 is 1:1. Let's try:\n\nBr + BrF3 + F2 → BrF5 + ... \n\nBalanced as:\n\nBr + BrF3 + F2 → 2 BrF3? No. Or:\n\nBr + BrF3 + F2 → BrF5 + BrF\n\nLeft: 2 Br, 3 F + 2 F = 2 Br, 5 F.\n\nRight: 1 Br + 5 F (BrF5) + 1 Br + 1 F (BrF) = 2 Br, 6 F. Not balanced. Add another F2?\n\nBr + BrF3 + 2 F2 → BrF5 + BrF + F2? This is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, and the molecular weight of BrF4 being in option C, and the other plausible options, I think the most likely answer is option C:140-160.\n\nBut wait, let's check another possibility. If Y is not bromine but another element, like iodine. Let's try the fluorine percentage calculation again.\n\nIf A2 is IFx with 31.96% F:\n\n[ x * 19 ] / (126.90 + x * 19) = 0.3196\n\nSolving:\n\n19x = 0.3196*(126.90 + 19x)\n\n19x = 0.3196*126.90 + 0.3196*19x\n\n19x - 0.3196*19x = 0.3196*126.90\n\nx*(19 - 0.3196*19) = 0.3196*126.90\n\nx*19*(1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196*126.90\n\nx*19*0.6804 = 0.3196*126.90\n\nx = [0.3196*126.90] / [19*0.6804]\n\nCalculate numerator: 0.3196*126.90 ≈ 40.56\n\nDenominator: 19*0.6804 ≈ 12.9276\n\nx ≈ 40.56 / 12.9276 ≈ 3.14\n\nSo x ≈ 3.14, which suggests x=3. Let's check IF3.\n\nMolar mass of IF3: 126.90 + 3*19 = 126.90 + 57 = 183.90 g/mol\n\nPercentage F: 57 / 183.90 ≈ 30.99%, which is lower than 31.96%. Close but not exact. If x=4:\n\nIF4: 126.90 + 4*19 = 126.90 + 76 = 202.90 g/mol\n\nPercentage F: 76 / 202.90 ≈ 37.46%, too high. So no. If x=3.14, it's between 3 and 4, but since x must be integer, this doesn't fit. Hence, Y is likely not iodine.\n\nBack to Br. Given that, and the molecular weight of BrF4 is 155.9, which is in option C (140-160), I think the answer is C.\n\nBut let's check one more thing: the five binary compounds. If Y is Br, the five fluorides are BrF, BrF3, BrF5, BrF2, and BrF4 (if it exists). BrF4 is not commonly known, but perhaps under certain conditions it can be formed. If the problem states five compounds, this might be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of A4 (BrF4) is 155.9 g/mol, which falls in option C:140-160.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
