Hmm, let me recall what the Landé g-factor is. From what I remember, the Landé g-factor is a multiplicative term in the expression for the Zeeman effect, which tells us how the energy levels of an atom split in a magnetic field. The formula for the Landé g-factor is given by:\n\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)}\n$$\n\nWait, but the question mentions $ g_1 $. Maybe that's just another notation for the Landé g-factor? I think sometimes it's written as $ g_J $, but maybe in this context they use $ g_1 $. Let me confirm the formula again.\n\nYes, the general formula for the Landé g-factor when considering the total angular momentum $ J = L + S $ is the one above. However, since the problem states that the atom has only one valence electron, that might simplify things. For a single valence electron, the spin $ S $ is $ \\frac{1}{2} $, because an electron has spin-1/2. The orbital angular momentum quantum number is $ l $, so the total orbital angular momentum $ L = l $, since there's only one electron contributing. Similarly, the total spin $ S = \\frac{1}{2} $. Then the total angular momentum $ J $ can be either $ L + S $ or $ L - S $, depending on the coupling. The problem specifies that $ j = l + \\frac{1}{2} $, so that would correspond to $ J = L + S $, since $ L = l $ and $ S = \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nSo substituting into the Landé g-factor formula:\n\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)}\n$$\n\nLet me plug in $ J = j = l + \\frac{1}{2} $, $ S = \\frac{1}{2} $, and $ L = l $.\n\nFirst, let me compute each term in the numerator:\n\n1. $ J(J+1) = \\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(l + \\frac{1}{2} + 1\\right) = \\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(l + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) $\n2. $ S(S+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{4} $\n3. $ L(L+1) = l(l + 1) $\n\nSo the numerator becomes:\n\n$$\n\\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(l + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) + \\frac{3}{4} - l(l + 1)\n$$\n\nLet me expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand $ \\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(l + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) $:\n\nMultiply the two binomials:\n\n$$\nl \\times l + l \\times \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times l + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n$$\n= l^2 + \\frac{3}{2}l + \\frac{1}{2}l + \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n$$\n= l^2 + 2l + \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n\nThen subtract $ l(l + 1) $:\n\n$ l(l + 1) = l^2 + l $\n\nSo the entire numerator:\n\n$$\n\\left(l^2 + 2l + \\frac{3}{4}\\right) + \\frac{3}{4} - (l^2 + l)\n$$\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst, combine the constants:\n\n$ \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} $\n\nThen combine the $ l^2 $ terms:\n\n$ l^2 - l^2 = 0 $\n\nThen the $ l $ terms:\n\n$ 2l - l = l $\n\nSo overall, the numerator simplifies to:\n\n$$\nl + \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n\nNow the denominator is $ 2J(J+1) $, which is $ 2 \\times \\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(l + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) $. Wait, earlier we computed $ J(J+1) = l^2 + 2l + \\frac{3}{4} $, so multiplying by 2 gives $ 2l^2 + 4l + \\frac{3}{2} $. But maybe there's a better way to write this.\n\nBut actually, let me recall that $ J = l + \\frac{1}{2} $, so $ J(J + 1) = \\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(l + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) $. Therefore, the denominator is $ 2 \\times \\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(l + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) $.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the Landé g-factor is:\n\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{l + \\frac{3}{2}}{2 \\times \\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(l + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe $ l + \\frac{3}{2} $ cancels out in numerator and denominator:\n\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{1}{2 \\times \\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2l + 1}\n$$\n\nWait, let me verify that step again. The numerator is $ l + 3/2 $, denominator is $ 2 \\times (l + 1/2)(l + 3/2) $. So dividing them gives $ [l + 3/2] / [2(l + 1/2)(l + 3/2)] = 1 / [2(l + 1/2)] $. Therefore:\n\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{1}{2\\left(l + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2l + 1}\n$$\n\nSimplify that expression:\n\nLet me write $ 2l + 1 $ as the denominator. So:\n\n$$\ng_J = \\frac{(2l + 1) + 1}{2l + 1} = \\frac{2l + 2}{2l + 1} = \\frac{2(l + 1)}{2l + 1}\n$$\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have $ 1 + \\frac{1}{2l + 1} $, then converting 1 to have the same denominator:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2l + 1}{2l + 1} + \\frac{1}{2l + 1} = \\frac{2l + 1 + 1}{2l + 1} = \\frac{2l + 2}{2l + 1} = \\frac{2(l + 1)}{2l + 1}\n$$\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the Landé g-factor for this case is $ \\frac{2(l + 1)}{2l + 1} $.\n\nBut the question asks for the range of $ g_1 $, which I think is this $ g_J $. However, since $ l $ is a quantum number for a single valence electron, $ l $ can take integer values starting from 0 upwards. For a single electron, possible values of $ l $ depend on the shell, but in general, for any atom, $ l $ can be 0, 1, 2,... up to $ n - 1 $, but since we are talking about the range of $ g_1 $, we need to consider all possible values of $ l $.\n\nBut since $ l $ is non-negative integer, let's analyze the expression $ \\frac{2(l + 1)}{2l + 1} $ for $ l = 0, 1, 2, ... $.\n\nLet me compute this for different values of $ l $:\n\nFor $ l = 0 $:\n\n$$\ng_J = \\frac{2(0 + 1)}{2(0) + 1} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n$$\n\nFor $ l = 1 $:\n\n$$\ng_J = \\frac{2(1 + 1)}{2(1) + 1} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.333...\n$$\n\nFor $ l = 2 $:\n\n$$\ng_J = \\frac{2(2 + 1)}{2(2) + 1} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2\n$$\n\nFor $ l = 3 $:\n\n$$\ng_J = \\frac{2(3 + 1)}{2(3) + 1} = \\frac{8}{7} \\approx 1.1428...\n$$\n\nFor $ l = 4 $:\n\n$$\ng_J = \\frac{2(4 + 1)}{2(4) + 1} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.111...\n$$\n\nAnd so on. It seems that as $ l $ increases, $ g_J $ approaches 1. Let me check the limit as $ l \\to \\infty $:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{l \\to \\infty} \\frac{2(l + 1)}{2l + 1} = \\lim_{l \\to \\infty} \\frac{2l + 2}{2l + 1} = \\lim_{l \\to \\infty} \\frac{2 + \\frac{2}{l}}{2 + \\frac{1}{l}} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n$$\n\nTherefore, the Landé g-factor $ g_J $ decreases from 2 towards 1 as $ l $ increases. Therefore, the maximum value of $ g_J $ is 2 (when $ l = 0 $), and the minimum approaches 1 as $ l $ approaches infinity. However, since $ l $ is a non-negative integer, the minimum value is just above 1. But since $ l $ can be any non-negative integer, the range of $ g_J $ is $ (1, 2] $.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"determine the range of the Landé g-factor $ g_1 $ for an atom with only one valence electron when $ j = l + \\frac{1}{2} $.\" So given that $ j = l + 1/2 $, which is the case when the orbital angular momentum and spin are aligned (the higher value of J), we have derived that $ g_J $ is between 1 and 2, with 2 being attainable when $ l = 0 $, and approaching 1 as $ l $ becomes large.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are any constraints on $ l $. For a single valence electron, $ l $ can be 0, 1, 2,... depending on the subshell (s, p, d, etc.). For example, in the case of hydrogen, the valence electron is in the s-orbital (l=0), but in other atoms, like alkali metals, the valence electron can be in higher orbitals. Therefore, $ l $ can indeed take any non-negative integer value, so the range of $ g_J $ is all real numbers from 1 up to and including 2.\n\nWait, but when $ l = 0 $, we get exactly 2, and for higher $ l $, it's less than 2 and approaching 1. Therefore, the range is $ 1 < g_J \\leq 2 $.\n\nBut let me check for $ l = 0 $. If $ l = 0 $, then $ j = l + 1/2 = 1/2 $. For a single electron with $ l = 0 $, that would be an s-electron. Then, using the formula we derived, $ g_J = 2 $. But another way to think about this is, for an electron in an s-orbital (l=0), the total angular momentum is just the spin, since orbital angular momentum is zero. Therefore, the g-factor should be the same as the electron spin g-factor, which is approximately 2. So that checks out. Therefore, when $ l = 0 $, the Landé g-factor is indeed 2.\n\nFor the case when $ l $ approaches infinity, the g-factor approaches 1. But why is that? If the orbital angular momentum is very large compared to the spin, then the contribution of the spin to the total angular momentum becomes negligible, so the g-factor approaches 1, which is the orbital g-factor (since for orbital angular momentum, the g-factor is 1). Therefore, this makes sense.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the Landé g-factor for this case is in the interval $ (1, 2] $. However, the question asks for the \"range of values for $ g_1 $\", so we need to express this as an interval. Since $ l $ is a non-negative integer, $ g_1 $ can take discrete values for each $ l $, but the question says \"range\", which might refer to the continuous interval that contains all possible values. However, since $ l $ is quantized, the possible values of $ g_1 $ are discrete points approaching 1 from above, with the maximum at 2.\n\nBut maybe the question expects a continuous range? Or maybe just the maximum and minimum? Let me check the problem statement again: \"Determine the range of the Landé g-factor $ g_1 $ for an atom with only one valence electron when $ j = l + \\frac{1}{2} $. Please calculate the range of values for $ g_1 $.\"\n\nSince $ l $ can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...), the possible values of $ g_1 $ are:\n\nFor $ l = 0 $: 2\n\nFor $ l = 1 $: 4/3 ≈ 1.333...\n\nFor $ l = 2 $: 6/5 = 1.2\n\nFor $ l = 3 $: 8/7 ≈ 1.142...\n\nAnd so on, approaching 1.\n\nTherefore, the range of possible values is all real numbers greater than 1 and up to and including 2. Even though the actual values are discrete, the question says \"range\", which in mathematical terms is the set of all possible output values. However, since $ l $ is quantized, the actual possible $ g_1 $ values are discrete. But perhaps in this context, they just want the interval between 1 and 2, with 2 included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach to find the range without plugging in numbers. Let me think. Since we have the expression:\n\n$$\ng_J = \\frac{2(l + 1)}{2l + 1}\n$$\n\nLet me denote $ x = l $, where $ x $ is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). Then:\n\n$$\ng_J(x) = \\frac{2(x + 1)}{2x + 1}\n$$\n\nWe can analyze this function for real numbers $ x \\geq 0 $, and then see its behavior.\n\nTaking derivative with respect to x:\n\nLet me compute $ dg_J/dx $:\n\nLet $ f(x) = \\frac{2(x + 1)}{2x + 1} $\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{2(2x + 1) - 2(x + 1)(2)}{(2x + 1)^2} = \\frac{4x + 2 - 4x - 4}{(2x + 1)^2} = \\frac{-2}{(2x + 1)^2}\n$$\n\nWhich is always negative for all $ x \\geq 0 $. Therefore, the function is strictly decreasing for $ x \\geq 0 $. Therefore, as $ x $ increases from 0 to infinity, $ f(x) $ decreases from 2 to 1. Therefore, the range of $ g_J $ is $ (1, 2] $.\n\nTherefore, even though $ l $ is an integer, the function is continuous and decreasing, so the range is from 1 (exclusive) to 2 (inclusive). However, since $ l $ is an integer, the actual values of $ g_J $ are discrete points within this interval. But the question says \"range of values\", so depending on the context, it might accept the interval $ 1 < g_1 \\leq 2 $.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check if there is a lower bound greater than 1. Since as $ l $ approaches infinity, $ g_J $ approaches 1, but never actually reaches 1. Therefore, 1 is the infimum, but not attainable. The maximum is 2, which is attainable when $ l = 0 $.\n\nTherefore, the range is all real numbers between 1 and 2, including 2 but not including 1. So in interval notation, $ (1, 2] $.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the Landé g-factor $ g_1 $ ranges from just above 1 up to 2, with 2 being the maximum value when $ l = 0 $. So the range is $ 1 < g_1 \\leq 2 $.\n\nBut let me check if there is a case where $ g_1 $ could be less than 1? For example, if there was some other configuration, but in this case, since $ j = l + 1/2 $, and given that the formula we derived is always greater than 1 for all $ l \\geq 0 $, the answer is no. Therefore, the range is indeed between 1 and 2.\n\nAnother way to think about the Landé g-factor: for a single electron, when $ j = l + 1/2 $, the formula simplifies as we did, and since $ l \\geq 0 $, the expression $ \\frac{2(l + 1)}{2l + 1} $ is always between 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the Landé g-factor $ g_1 $ lies in the interval $ (1, 2] $.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check another reference or example. For example, take the case of hydrogen (n=1, l=0, s=1/2). Then j can be 1/2 (since l + s = 0 + 1/2 = 1/2). Then the Landé g-factor is 2, as we found. For another example, take an electron in a p-orbital (l=1). Then j can be 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. The Landé g-factor would be 4/3 ≈ 1.333, which is between 1 and 2. For an electron in a d-orbital (l=2), j=5/2, and g-factor is 6/5=1.2. So all these examples confirm that it's between 1 and 2. Therefore, the range is indeed (1, 2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the Landé g-factor $ g_1 $ ranges from just above 1 up to and including 2. So the range is $ 1 < g_1 \\leq 2 $.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe range of the Landé g-factor $ g_1 $ is \\boxed{(1, 2]}.\n</think>"}
