Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, let me write out the series to get a better sense:\n\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + ... + 99 - 100.\n\nHmm, I notice that the signs are alternating. Positive for the odd numbers and negative for the even numbers. So, starting with 1 (positive), then subtracting 2, adding 3, subtracting 4, and so on, up until subtracting 100. \n\nSince the series alternates and ends with a negative term, I wonder if I can group the terms in pairs. Like (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + ... + (99 - 100). Let me check if that works. Each pair would be an odd number followed by the next even number, subtracted. \n\nLet me compute one of these pairs: 1 - 2 = -1, 3 - 4 = -1, 5 - 6 = -1... It seems like each pair adds up to -1. So if I can figure out how many such pairs there are from 1 to 100, I can multiply the number of pairs by -1 to get the total sum. \n\nNow, since the series goes up to 100 and each pair consists of two numbers, the total number of pairs should be 100 divided by 2, right? So 100 / 2 = 50. Therefore, there are 50 pairs, each summing to -1. \n\nSo the total sum would be 50 * (-1) = -50. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's take the sum up to 4: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4. If I group them as (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) = (-1) + (-1) = -2. According to my formula, n = 4, number of pairs is 4 / 2 = 2, so 2 * (-1) = -2. Correct. \n\nAnother example: up to 6. 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) = -1 -1 -1 = -3. Number of pairs is 6 / 2 = 3, so 3 * (-1) = -3. Correct again. \n\nSo seems like my method is valid. Therefore, applying it to 100 terms, which form 50 pairs, each summing to -1, gives -50. \n\nBut let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm. \n\nAnother approach: The series is an alternating series of positive and negative integers. Let me separate the positive terms and the negative terms. \n\nThe positive terms are the odd numbers from 1 to 99. The negative terms are the even numbers from 2 to 100. \n\nSo, the sum can be written as (Sum of odd numbers from 1 to 99) - (Sum of even numbers from 2 to 100). \n\nLet me compute each sum separately. \n\nFirst, the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 99. How many odd numbers are there? From 1 to 99, inclusive, there are 50 odd numbers (since 99 is the 50th odd number: (99 - 1)/2 + 1 = 50). \n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers is n². Wait, is that correct? Let me recall. The sum of the first n odd numbers is n². For example, 1 + 3 = 4 (which is 2²), 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 (3²), etc. So yes, if there are 50 odd numbers, the sum is 50² = 2500. \n\nNow, the sum of even numbers from 2 to 100. The formula for the sum of the first n even numbers is n(n + 1). Wait, let me check. The first n even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n. The sum is 2(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 2 * [n(n + 1)/2] = n(n + 1). \n\nBut here, the even numbers go up to 100. Since 100 is the 50th even number (since 100 / 2 = 50). Therefore, n = 50. So the sum is 50 * 51 = 2550. \n\nTherefore, the total sum of the original series is Sum(odd) - Sum(even) = 2500 - 2550 = -50. \n\nSame result as before! So that confirms it. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about another way. Let me consider the series as an arithmetic sequence? Wait, no. The series itself isn't arithmetic because the difference between terms alternates between + and -. But maybe we can model it differently. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for an alternating series? Although this is a finite series. Let me recall that for an alternating series, but usually, those are infinite. \n\nAlternatively, think about the general formula for such a series. Let me denote the sum S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - ... + (-1)^{n+1}n. In this case, n is 100, which is even. \n\nBut let me try to find a general formula for S. \n\nIf n is even, then we can write S as (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (n - 1 - n). Which is (-1) added n/2 times. Therefore, S = -n/2. \n\nIn our case, n = 100, so S = -100 / 2 = -50. \n\nIf n is odd, then S would be the same as the sum up to n - 1 (which is even) plus the last term n. So, for example, if n is odd, S = - (n - 1)/2 + n = (n + 1)/2. \n\nBut since our problem is with n = 100, which is even, we can directly use S = -n/2 = -50. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is -50. \n\nBut let me check with yet another approach for thoroughness. \n\nLet me write the series as:\n\nSum_{k=1}^{100} (-1)^{k+1} * k\n\nSince the sign alternates starting with positive for k=1. \n\nSo, for k odd, (-1)^{k+1} = (-1)^{even} = 1, and for k even, (-1)^{k+1} = (-1)^{odd} = -1. So that matches our series. \n\nNow, there is a formula for such a sum. Let me recall. \n\nFor the sum from k=1 to n of (-1)^{k+1} * k. \n\nIf n is even, let n = 2m. Then,\n\nSum = [1 - 2] + [3 - 4] + ... + [(2m - 1) - 2m] = m*(-1) = -m. Since n = 2m, m = n/2, so Sum = -n/2. \n\nWhich again gives us -100/2 = -50. \n\nAlternatively, if we use the formula for such an alternating sum. \n\nAlternatively, derive it using recurrence or other methods. \n\nAlternatively, consider splitting into two separate sums: \n\nSum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} * k = Sum_{j=1}^{ceil(n/2)} (2j - 1) - Sum_{j=1}^{floor(n/2)} 2j \n\nWhich is similar to separating odds and evens as before. \n\nSince for n even, ceil(n/2) = floor(n/2) = n/2. Therefore, \n\nSum = [Sum_{j=1}^{n/2} (2j - 1)] - [Sum_{j=1}^{n/2} 2j] \n\n= Sum_{j=1}^{n/2} [ (2j - 1) - 2j ] \n\n= Sum_{j=1}^{n/2} (-1) \n\n= -n/2 \n\nSame result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, it seems that the answer is -50. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me compute manually for a small n where I can calculate easily. \n\nTake n = 2: 1 - 2 = -1. According to formula, -2 / 2 = -1. Correct. \n\nn = 4: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2. Formula: -4 / 2 = -2. Correct. \n\nn = 6: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 = -3. Formula: -6 / 2 = -3. Correct. \n\nn = 1: 1. Formula for odd n: (n + 1)/2 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1. Correct. \n\nn = 3: 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. Formula: (3 + 1)/2 = 2. Correct. \n\nTherefore, formula seems solid. \n\nTherefore, applying it to n = 100, answer is -50. \n\nAlternatively, another way: Let me use the formula for arithmetic series? Wait, but this isn't an arithmetic series. The problem is that the difference between terms isn't constant. Let's check:\n\nFirst term a1 = 1, second term a2 = -2, third term a3 = 3, fourth term a4 = -4... So differences between terms are:\n\na2 - a1 = -2 - 1 = -3\n\na3 - a2 = 3 - (-2) = 5\n\na4 - a3 = -4 - 3 = -7\n\nSo differences are -3, +5, -7,... Not constant, so not arithmetic. Similarly, ratios aren't constant either, so not geometric. Therefore, can't use standard arithmetic or geometric series formulas. \n\nBut since we already have multiple methods confirming the result, perhaps that's unnecessary. \n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose S(n) is the sum up to n. Then S(n) = S(n - 1) + (-1)^{n + 1} * n. But solving this recurrence might be more complex. However, for even n, maybe we can find a pattern. \n\nBut since we already have multiple confirmations, perhaps it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, think about pairing terms as I did first. Since each pair is -1, and 50 pairs, -50. \n\nAlternatively, think of the entire sum as follows:\n\nThe series is 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + 99 - 100. \n\nIf we factor out a -1 from each pair:\n\n= (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (99 - 100)\n\n= (-1) + (-1) + ... + (-1) [50 times]\n\n= -50 * 1 = -50. \n\nYep, same result. \n\nTherefore, I think I can be confident that the answer is -50. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me do a small code snippet in my mind. Let's say I write a simple loop adding these numbers. \n\nInitialize sum = 0.\n\nFor i from 1 to 100:\n\n    if i is odd, add i to sum.\n\n    if i is even, subtract i from sum.\n\nWhich is equivalent to adding (-1)^(i+1)*i.\n\nAlternatively, since for each i, if i is odd, sign is +, else -.\n\nSo, let me compute for i=1 to 100:\n\nsum += i * (-1)^(i+1)\n\nBut since I can't actually run code here, let me simulate for a small n again. For n=4:\n\ni=1: sum = 0 + 1 = 1\n\ni=2: sum = 1 - 2 = -1\n\ni=3: sum = -1 + 3 = 2\n\ni=4: sum = 2 - 4 = -2. Which matches. \n\nSimilarly, for n=6:\n\ni=5: sum = -2 +5=3\n\ni=6: sum=3-6=-3. Correct. \n\nSo for n=100, if I imagine continuing this pattern, each pair of odd and even adds -1. So after 100 terms, 50 pairs, -50. \n\nTherefore, all methods converge to -50. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is definitely -50. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum is \\boxed{-50}.\n</think>"}
