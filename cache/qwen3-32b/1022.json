{"question":"A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of 1-hexene at 20 bar synthesis gas pressure and 80 centigrade. He made up a mixture of hexenes and C7-aldehydes to find the conditions for gas chromatography (GC) to effectively separate these compounds, and after some testing, he eventually runs the equipment isothermal at 60 centigrade, and all compounds were eluted within 25 minutes.\nThen, he performs the hydroformylation reaction, taking samples through a syringe every 15 minutes, which he then filters through a silica-containing pipette into GC vials for analysis to remove catalyst and prevent further reaction in the GC vial. The GC instrument is set up, and he injects sample by sample every 30 minutes. The first two samples indicate good conversion, low isomerization of 1-hexene, and mostly 1-heptanal as the product.\nHowever, in the GC spectra of later samples, he notices new but small peaks, eluting irregularly at different retention times when comparing the spectra. He describes his observation to a more experienced colleague. She explains the problem and how to fix it. After following her advice, the spectra only differ in the height of the peaks with very small deviations in retention times. What advice did she give him? A:Transfer your samples directly into argon-purged GC vials, which also contain some activated carbon, and store them in the fridge before analysis.

The setup is at 20 bar synthesis gas pressure and 80°C. He's trying to set up gas chromatography (GC) to separate the hexenes and C7-aldehydes. He did some testing and found that running the GC isothermal at 60°C allows all compounds to elute within 25 minutes.\n\nThen he starts taking samples every 15 minutes during the reaction, filtering them through a silica-containing pipette into GC vials. The purpose is to remove the catalyst and prevent further reaction in the vials. He injects the samples into the GC every 30 minutes. The first two samples show good conversion, low isomerization, and mostly 1-heptanal. But later samples have new small peaks with irregular retention times. He talks to a colleague who explains the problem and gives advice. After following it, the peaks' heights vary but the retention times are stable. The question is, what advice did the colleague give?\n\nThe options are A to D. Let me think through what could cause the new peaks and irregular retention times.\n\nFirst, the problem is that the later samples have new peaks that weren't there before, and the retention times are inconsistent. This suggests that something in the later samples is causing either decomposition or some reaction during sample handling or storage before GC analysis. The colleague's advice fixes the retention time issue but not the peak heights, which probably relate to the amount of product formed over time.\n\nThe student is filtering through silica. Silica is a desiccant and can adsorb polar compounds. If the reaction mixture contains polar components (like aldehydes), maybe some of the desired products are being adsorbed onto the silica, leading to loss of product. However, if the problem is in later samples, perhaps the catalyst or some other component is interacting with the silica in a way that introduces impurities or causes decomposition. Alternatively, maybe the catalyst residues are not fully removed by silica, leading to continued reaction in the vials, causing side products. But the student is supposed to filter to prevent that. However, if the filtering isn't effective, maybe the catalyst is still present in the sample, causing further reaction in the GC vial. But the student's method is to filter through silica to remove catalyst. If the catalyst is not fully removed, maybe some remains and causes side reactions. But then why would the peaks appear later? Maybe the catalyst is degrading or reacting over time in the sample vials, leading to new compounds. But how does the filtering method relate to that?\n\nAnother possibility is that the samples are not being properly preserved. If the samples are left at room temperature or not inert, maybe oxygen is getting in and causing oxidation or other side reactions. The presence of new peaks could be oxidation products. The colleague suggests using argon-purged vials and activated carbon. Argon would inert the atmosphere, preventing oxidation. Activated carbon can adsorb impurities or byproducts, maybe some decomposition products. Also, storing in the fridge would slow down any reactions.\n\nOption A says to transfer samples directly into argon-purged GC vials with activated carbon and store in the fridge. This would prevent oxidation and adsorb any impurities, stabilizing the samples.\n\nOption B suggests using activated carbon instead of silica for filtering. Activated carbon is good for adsorbing organic compounds, but if the goal is to remove the catalyst (rhodium), maybe it's not as effective. If the catalyst is a metal complex, it might not be adsorbed by activated carbon. But maybe the silica is causing some issues. However, the problem is with new peaks in later samples. If the filtering method is causing some decomposition, perhaps the silica is not inert. For example, if the reaction mixture is acidic or basic, and silica is reacting, maybe leading to some decomposition. But I'm not sure.\n\nOption C is using a different GC column. If the column was not suitable, maybe the separation isn't consistent. However, the first samples worked fine. If the column is degrading due to some components in the later samples, that could cause retention time issues. But the colleague's advice is about sample handling, not the column. The problem arises in later samples, so maybe the column is okay.\n\nOption D suggests increasing the GC temperature to 250°C before cooling. This might be to clean the column, but if the problem is in the sample, not the column, this might not help. Also, the colleague's advice leads to consistent retention times, so maybe the sample preparation was causing inconsistent injection or decomposition.\n\nSo, the main issue seems to be sample degradation between the time of sampling and injection. The new peaks are likely due to oxidation or side reactions occurring in the samples stored in the vials. The first samples were analyzed quickly, so they didn't degrade, but later samples were left longer, leading to new compounds. The colleague's advice would be to prevent this by using an inert atmosphere (argon), maybe adsorb any reactive species with activated carbon, and store in the fridge to slow reactions. That matches option A. Option B is about filtering with activated carbon instead of silica, but the problem is after filtering. The issue is in the sample storage, not the filtering step. So the correct answer is likely A.\n</think>"}
