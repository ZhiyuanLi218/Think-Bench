This means:\n\n- The **horizontal motion** is uniform (constant speed, assuming no air resistance).\n- The **vertical motion** is accelerated due to gravity, and the time it takes to fall a certain distance depends only on gravity and the vertical displacement.\n\nTherefore, **both balls will fall the same vertical distance in the same amount of time**, regardless of their horizontal speeds. The vertical descent is not influenced by the horizontal speed.\n\n---\n\n### Horizontal Motion and Time to Reach the Net\n\nThe horizontal distance to the net is fixed. The **time** it takes for a ball to reach the net is given by:\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{d}{v}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ t $ is the time,\n- $ d $ is the horizontal distance to the net,\n- $ v $ is the horizontal speed of the ball.\n\nSo:\n- The **faster** ball (greater $ v $) reaches the net in **less time**.\n- The **slower** ball (lesser $ v $) takes **more time** to reach the net.\n\n---\n\n### Vertical Fall During That Time\n\nDuring this time, the ball is falling vertically due to gravity. The vertical distance fallen is given by:\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\n$$\n\nSince the **slower ball takes more time** to reach the net, it has **more time to fall**, and thus falls a **greater vertical distance**. If this vertical distance is more than the height of the net, the ball **does not clear the net**.\n\nConversely, the **faster ball** takes **less time** to reach the net, so it **falls a smaller vertical distance**, allowing it to **clear the net**.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's analyze the options in this context:\n\n- **(A)** *The ball with the lesser speed takes more time to descend the same distance*  \n  ❌ Incorrect. The time to descend a given vertical distance is the same for both balls, regardless of their horizontal speed.\n\n- **(B)** *The ball with the lesser speed has a greater vertical speed when descending the same distance*  \n  ❌ Incorrect. The vertical speed depends on the time in the air, not the horizontal speed. Since they descend the same vertical distance, their vertical speeds are the same.\n\n- **(C)** *The ball with the greater speed takes less time to travel the same horizontal distance*  \n  ✅ Correct. This is a factual statement and is the **reason** why the faster ball clears the net: it reaches the net in less time, so it doesn't fall as far.\n\n- **(D)** *The ball with the greater speed descends a greater distance in the same time interval*  \n  ❌ Incorrect. If both balls are in the air for the same time interval, they will descend the same vertical distance.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so there's this question about two ping-pong balls being launched horizontally from the same height, but with different speeds. The one with the higher speed goes over the net, and the slower one doesn't. The question is asking why that happens, and there are four options to choose from. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic physics concepts about projectile motion. When an object is launched horizontally, its vertical motion is independent of its horizontal motion. That means the time it takes to hit the ground (or in this case, to descend to the level of the net) depends only on the vertical component of its motion, which is affected by gravity. The horizontal speed doesn't influence how quickly the object falls vertically.\n\nSo, both balls are released from the same height, and they both experience the same acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, they should take the same amount of time to fall to any given vertical distance, right? For example, if the net is a certain height below the launcher, both balls will take the same time to reach that height. That would mean that the time each ball takes to descend is the same, regardless of their horizontal speed. \n\nBut wait, the question says that the faster ball crosses the net while the slower one doesn't. That suggests that the horizontal distance each ball covers before descending to the net's height is different. The faster ball has a higher horizontal speed, so in the same time it takes to fall to the net's height, it travels more horizontal distance, allowing it to clear the net. The slower ball, with less horizontal speed, doesn't cover enough horizontal distance in that same time and thus doesn't reach the other side of the net.\n\nSo, the key here is that the time each ball spends in the air until it reaches the net's height is the same. But because the horizontal speed is different, the horizontal distance they cover in that time is different. Therefore, the reason the slower ball doesn't cross the net is that it doesn't travel enough horizontal distance in the time it takes to fall to the net's height. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) The ball with the lesser speed takes more time to descend the same distance. But earlier I thought the time to descend is the same for both, because vertical motion is independent of horizontal speed. So A might be incorrect.\n\nB) The ball with the lesser speed has a greater vertical speed when descending the same distance. Hmm. Wait, vertical speed here probably refers to the vertical component of velocity. But when you drop an object, its vertical speed increases due to gravity. However, since both balls are in the air for the same amount of time (assuming they descend the same vertical distance to the net), their vertical speeds should be the same. So B might be incorrect.\n\nC) The ball with the greater speed takes less time to travel the same horizontal distance. Wait, no. The horizontal distance traveled is horizontal speed multiplied by time. If the time is the same (since vertical motion determines the time to reach the net's height), then a greater horizontal speed would mean the ball covers more horizontal distance in that time. So the reason the faster ball crosses the net is that it covers the necessary horizontal distance in the time available. Therefore, the slower ball doesn't have enough horizontal speed to cover the required horizontal distance in that time. But option C says the faster ball takes less time to travel the same horizontal distance. Wait, but the horizontal distance isn't the same. The horizontal distance required to cross the net is the same for both balls, right? The net is at a certain horizontal distance from the launcher. So if the horizontal distance to the net is fixed, then the time it takes to reach that horizontal distance would depend on the horizontal speed. For example, if the net is at distance D, then time = D / horizontal speed. So a faster horizontal speed means less time to reach the net's horizontal position. However, during that time, the ball is also falling. So if the time to reach the horizontal position of the net is less for the faster ball, then the vertical distance it falls in that time would be less. Wait, but if the time is less, then the vertical distance fallen would be less (since vertical distance is ½gt²). So if the faster ball reaches the horizontal position of the net in less time, it hasn't fallen as far, so it's still above the net. Whereas the slower ball takes longer to reach the horizontal position of the net, so it falls more, and maybe hits the net or goes below it. Wait, but the question says the slower one doesn't cross the net. So maybe the net is at a certain height, and the ball must reach the horizontal position of the net before it falls below that height. Let me think again.\n\nLet me try to visualize. Imagine the launcher is on one side of the net, and the net is at a certain horizontal distance away and a certain vertical height below the launcher. For each ball, we can calculate two things: the time it takes to reach the horizontal position of the net, and the vertical distance it has fallen in that time. If the vertical distance fallen is less than the height of the net, the ball clears it. If it's more, it doesn't.\n\nSo for the faster ball, horizontal speed is higher, so time to reach the net's horizontal distance is less. Therefore, vertical fall is ½g(t)^2, which is smaller. So if the vertical fall is less than the net's height, it clears. The slower ball takes longer to reach the horizontal position of the net, so vertical fall is more, maybe exceeding the net's height, so it doesn't clear.\n\nSo in this case, the reason is that the slower ball takes more time to travel the required horizontal distance, and thus falls more in that time. So the correct reasoning would be that the slower ball takes more time to cover the horizontal distance to the net, leading to more vertical drop.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nC) The ball with the greater speed takes less time to travel the same horizontal distance. That's correct, because horizontal distance is same (to the net), so time is horizontal distance divided by speed. So greater speed means less time. So option C is a true statement. But how does this relate to the reason why the slower ball doesn't cross?\n\nThe reason is that because the slower ball takes more time to reach the horizontal position of the net, it has more time to fall vertically, thus dropping below the net. So the correct answer would be related to the time taken to cover the horizontal distance. So option C is stating that the faster ball takes less time to travel the same horizontal distance. But the question is why the slower one doesn't cross. The answer would be because it takes more time to cover that horizontal distance, hence falls more. But the options don't directly say that. Option C is about the faster ball taking less time, which is a fact. But does that explain why the slower one doesn't cross?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are phrased differently. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: The ball with the greater speed takes less time to travel the same horizontal distance. So this is a correct statement. And if that's the case, then the slower ball takes more time. Therefore, during that longer time, it falls more, so doesn't clear the net. Therefore, the reason is because the slower ball takes more time to cover the horizontal distance, leading to more vertical drop. But the options don't have that. The options given are:\n\nA) lesser speed takes more time to descend same distance. But descending same distance (vertical) would take same time, since vertical motion is independent. So A is incorrect.\n\nB) lesser speed has greater vertical speed when descending same distance. Vertical speed depends on time, not horizontal speed. Since they descend same distance, they take same time, so same vertical speed. So B is incorrect.\n\nC) greater speed takes less time to travel same horizontal distance. Yes, that's true. But how does that explain why the slower one doesn't cross? Because the horizontal distance to the net is fixed. So if the time to reach that distance is less for the faster ball, then in that less time, the vertical fall is less. So the faster ball is above the net. The slower ball takes longer to reach that horizontal distance, so falls more, hence below the net. Therefore, the reason is because the slower ball takes more time to cover the horizontal distance, which is the inverse of option C. But option C is about the faster ball taking less time. However, the question is asking for the reason why the slower one doesn't cross. So maybe the correct answer is C, because it's stating that the faster ball can cover the horizontal distance in less time, so it doesn't fall as much. Therefore, the fact that the slower one takes more time leads to more fall. But the options don't have the inverse. So maybe C is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider option D: the ball with the greater speed descends a greater distance in the same time interval. No, that's not right. If two balls are in the air for the same time, they descend the same vertical distance. But if the faster ball is in the air for less time (because it covers the horizontal distance to the net faster), then it would descend less. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Because the greater speed ball takes less time to travel the horizontal distance to the net, meaning it has less time to fall vertically. The slower ball takes more time to reach the net's horizontal position, so falls more and doesn't clear. Therefore, the reason the slower one doesn't cross is because it takes more time to cover the horizontal distance, leading to more vertical drop. But since option C is about the faster ball taking less time, which is a true statement and explains why the slower one has issues, then C is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
