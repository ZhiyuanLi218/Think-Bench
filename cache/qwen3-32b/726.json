He messed up by using 3 + 4i instead of -3 + 4i. The problem says that when he did 3 + 4i over 1 + 2i, he got 11/5 - 2/5 i. Now I need to find the correct answer with the original numerator, which is -3 + 4i.\n\nFirst, I remember that dividing complex numbers usually involves multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So, for the denominator 1 + 2i, the conjugate would be 1 - 2i. That should eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator when we multiply.\n\nLet me write down the original expression again: (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i). To simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 1 - 2i. So:\n\n[(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)] / [(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)]\n\nLet me compute the denominator first because that might be simpler. Using the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Here, a is 1 and b is 2i. Wait, actually, it's (1)^2 - (2i)^2. Let me calculate that:\n\nDenominator: 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - 4i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 - 4(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5. So the denominator is 5. That's straightforward.\n\nNow the numerator: (-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i). Let me expand this using the distributive property (FOIL method). Multiply each term in the first complex number by each term in the second.\n\nFirst: -3 * 1 = -3\n\nOuter: -3 * (-2i) = +6i\n\nInner: 4i * 1 = 4i\n\nLast: 4i * (-2i) = -8i²\n\nNow add all those together: -3 + 6i + 4i - 8i².\n\nCombine like terms: -3 + (6i + 4i) + (-8i²) = -3 + 10i -8i².\n\nAgain, since i² = -1, substitute that in: -3 + 10i -8(-1) = -3 + 10i + 8.\n\nSimplify the real parts: (-3 + 8) + 10i = 5 + 10i.\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to 5 + 10i and the denominator is 5. Therefore, the entire expression becomes (5 + 10i)/5. Dividing both terms by 5:\n\n5/5 + (10i)/5 = 1 + 2i.\n\nWait, so (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) simplifies to 1 + 2i? Let me check my calculations again because that seems straightforward, but maybe I made a mistake?\n\nLet me verify the numerator again:\n\n(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)\n\nFirst term: -3 * 1 = -3\n\nOuter term: -3 * (-2i) = 6i\n\nInner term: 4i * 1 = 4i\n\nLast term: 4i * (-2i) = -8i²\n\nAdding them up: -3 + 6i + 4i -8i²\n\nCombine like terms: -3 + 10i -8i². Since i² is -1, so -8*(-1) is +8. Therefore, -3 + 8 + 10i = 5 + 10i. Yes, that's correct. Then divide by 5: 5/5 + 10i/5 = 1 + 2i. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me cross-verify with another method. Maybe converting to polar form? Although that might be more complicated, but just to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the result that William got. He had (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) = 11/5 - 2/5 i. Maybe there's a relation between his incorrect numerator and the correct one?\n\nHis numerator was 3 + 4i, and the correct one is -3 + 4i. So the difference is in the real part: 3 vs -3. So if I can relate the two results?\n\nLet me denote the original problem as (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i). Let me think of this as ( -(3 - 4i) ) / (1 + 2i). Wait, no, original numerator is -3 + 4i, which is -(3 - 4i). So maybe there's some relation?\n\nBut William computed (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i). Let me see if there's a connection between his answer and the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if we know (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) = 11/5 - 2/5 i, then perhaps (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) would be something related? Let me try.\n\nLet me denote A = (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) = 11/5 - 2/5 i.\n\nThen, the correct expression is (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) = [ - (3 - 4i) ] / (1 + 2i). Wait, but William's numerator was 3 + 4i, not 3 - 4i. Maybe not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that (-3 + 4i) is (3 + 4i) - 6. So:\n\n[ (3 + 4i) - 6 ] / (1 + 2i) = [ (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) ] - [6/(1 + 2i) ].\n\nWe know that [ (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) ] is 11/5 - 2/5 i. Then subtract 6/(1 + 2i). Let's compute 6/(1 + 2i). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 - 2i:\n\n6*(1 - 2i)/[ (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) ] = 6*(1 - 2i)/5 = (6/5) - (12/5)i.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression would be:\n\n[11/5 - 2/5 i] - [6/5 - 12/5 i] = (11/5 - 6/5) + (-2/5 i + 12/5 i) = 5/5 + 10/5 i = 1 + 2i. Same result as before. So that's consistent. Therefore, seems like 1 + 2i is correct.\n\nBut let me check once again using another approach. Let me assume that the correct answer is 1 + 2i, then multiply by denominator and see if we get numerator.\n\nIf (1 + 2i)*(1 + 2i) = ?\n\nWait, no. Let me do (1 + 2i) multiplied by denominator (1 + 2i) would be (1 + 2i)^2. But that's not helpful. Wait, the correct answer should satisfy:\n\n(-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) = 1 + 2i. Therefore, multiplying both sides by (1 + 2i) should give -3 + 4i. Let's check:\n\n(1 + 2i)*(1 + 2i) = 1*(1) + 1*(2i) + 2i*(1) + 2i*(2i) = 1 + 2i + 2i + 4i² = 1 + 4i + 4(-1) = 1 + 4i - 4 = -3 + 4i. Yes! Exactly. Therefore, multiplying 1 + 2i by (1 + 2i) gives -3 + 4i, which is the numerator. Therefore, this confirms that (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) = 1 + 2i. Therefore, the answer should be 1 + 2i.\n\nBut let me check once more using another method. Maybe by separating the fraction into two terms?\n\nLet me write (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) as (-3)/(1 + 2i) + (4i)/(1 + 2i). Then compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: -3/(1 + 2i). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 - 2i:\n\n-3*(1 - 2i)/[ (1)^2 - (2i)^2 ] = -3*(1 - 2i)/[1 - (-4)] = -3*(1 - 2i)/5 = (-3/5) + (6/5)i.\n\nSecond term: 4i/(1 + 2i). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 - 2i:\n\n4i*(1 - 2i)/[1 - (2i)^2] = 4i*(1 - 2i)/[1 - (-4)] = 4i*(1 - 2i)/5.\n\nCompute numerator: 4i*1 - 4i*2i = 4i - 8i² = 4i -8(-1) = 4i + 8.\n\nTherefore, second term is (8 + 4i)/5 = 8/5 + 4/5 i.\n\nNow add the two terms together:\n\nFirst term: (-3/5 + 6/5 i) + (8/5 + 4/5 i) = (-3/5 + 8/5) + (6/5 i + 4/5 i) = (5/5) + (10/5)i = 1 + 2i. Same result again. So this method also gives 1 + 2i. Therefore, I can be confident that the correct answer is 1 + 2i.\n\nAlternatively, since I know that William's answer was 11/5 - 2/5 i, which is 2.2 - 0.4i, and my answer here is 1 + 2i, which is 1 + 2i. These are different, so that makes sense because he had a different numerator. Let me check if there's another way to see the relationship between the two results.\n\nIf we consider that the original numerator was -3 + 4i and William used 3 + 4i, then the difference between the numerators is 6. So maybe if I take William's result and subtract something?\n\nBut earlier I did that and it worked. But since we confirmed through multiple methods that the answer is 1 + 2i, I think that's solid.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try another approach. Let me represent complex numbers as vectors and perform division.\n\nThe division of complex numbers z/w can also be calculated by dividing their magnitudes and subtracting their angles. But since I might not remember the exact formulas, let me try.\n\nFirst, compute the magnitude of numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: -3 + 4i. The magnitude is sqrt((-3)^2 + (4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nDenominator: 1 + 2i. The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5).\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the result is 5 / sqrt(5) = sqrt(5). Which is approximately 2.236.\n\nNow, the angle (argument) of the numerator: arctangent of (4 / -3). But since the real part is negative and imaginary part is positive, it's in the second quadrant. The reference angle is arctan(4/3), so the actual angle is π - arctan(4/3).\n\nThe angle of the denominator: arctangent(2/1) = arctan(2), which is in the first quadrant.\n\nTherefore, the angle of the result is [π - arctan(4/3)] - arctan(2). Let me compute this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute tan(theta) where theta is the angle of the result. But this might get complicated. However, if the result is 1 + 2i, let's check its magnitude and angle.\n\nMagnitude of 1 + 2i is sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(5). Which matches the earlier calculation. The angle is arctan(2/1) = arctan(2). So the angle is arctan(2). Let me check if the angle from the original calculation is the same.\n\nOriginal angle difference: [π - arctan(4/3) - arctan(2)]? Wait, no. The angle of numerator minus angle of denominator.\n\nWait, angle of numerator is π - arctan(4/3). Angle of denominator is arctan(2). Therefore, angle of result is π - arctan(4/3) - arctan(2). Let me see if this is equal to arctan(2).\n\nSo, π - arctan(4/3) - arctan(2) = arctan(2)?\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nπ - arctan(4/3) - arctan(2) - arctan(2) = 0?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me think differently. Let me compute π - arctan(4/3) - arctan(2). Let me denote α = arctan(4/3), β = arctan(2). So the angle is π - α - β.\n\nIs π - α - β equal to arctan(2)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is some identity here. Let me try to compute tan(π - α - β). Since tan(π - x) = -tan(x). So tan(π - α - β) = -tan(α + β). Let's compute tan(α + β):\n\ntan(α + β) = [tan α + tan β]/[1 - tan α tan β]. We know tan α = 4/3, tan β = 2.\n\nSo tan(α + β) = [ (4/3) + 2 ] / [1 - (4/3)(2) ] = [ (4/3 + 6/3) ] / [1 - 8/3] = (10/3) / (-5/3) = (10/3) * (-3/5) = -2. Therefore tan(α + β) = -2. Therefore tan(π - α - β) = -tan(α + β) = -(-2) = 2. Therefore, tan(angle of result) = 2, which implies that the angle is arctan(2). Which matches the angle of 1 + 2i. Therefore, since the magnitude is sqrt(5) and angle is arctan(2), then the complex number is sqrt(5)*(cos(arctan(2)) + i sin(arctan(2))).\n\nLet me compute cos(arctan(2)) and sin(arctan(2)). If θ = arctan(2), then tan θ = 2 = opposite/adjacent = 2/1, so hypotenuse is sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(5). Therefore cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse = 1/sqrt(5), sin θ = 2/sqrt(5). Therefore the complex number is sqrt(5)*(1/sqrt(5) + 2i/sqrt(5)) = 1 + 2i. Which is exactly what we obtained earlier. Therefore, this confirms once again that the result is 1 + 2i.\n\nTherefore, after multiple methods and checks, I can be confident that the correct answer William should have obtained is 1 + 2i.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{1 + 2i}.\n</think>"}
