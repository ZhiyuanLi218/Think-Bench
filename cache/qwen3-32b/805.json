Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nWe have a semicircular arc with endpoints A and B, and radius 2. The arc is divided into seven congruent arcs by six equally spaced points C₁, C₂, ..., C₆. All chords of the form ACᵢ or BCᵢ are drawn. We need to find the product of the lengths of these twelve chords, and then find the remainder when that product is divided by 1000.\n\nAlright, so first, let me visualize the semicircle. A semicircle from A to B with radius 2. The semicircle is divided into seven equal arcs, so each arc between consecutive points (including between A and C₁, between C₁ and C₂, etc., up to C₆ and B) must be equal. Since it's a semicircle, the total angle is π radians. Dividing that into seven equal arcs means each arc corresponds to an angle of π/7 radians.\n\nTherefore, each of the six points C₁ to C₆ divides the semicircle into seven arcs of π/7 each. Now, we need to consider the chords from A to each Cᵢ and from B to each Cᵢ. There are six Cᵢs, so there are 6 + 6 = 12 chords. The product of their lengths is n, and we need n mod 1000.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing the product of these chord lengths. Let me think about how to compute chord lengths in a circle. The length of a chord in a circle of radius r subtended by an angle θ is given by 2r sin(θ/2). Let me verify that formula. If θ is the central angle between two points on the circle, then yes, the chord length is 2r sin(θ/2). So, since our radius is 2, the chord length would be 2*2*sin(θ/2) = 4 sin(θ/2).\n\nTherefore, for each chord ACᵢ and BCᵢ, we can compute their lengths based on the angle they subtend at the center.\n\nLet me set up coordinates to model this. Let me consider the semicircle as the upper half of a circle centered at the origin, with A at (-2, 0) and B at (2, 0). Wait, but actually, if the semicircle is from A to B, maybe it's better to have the diameter AB lying on the x-axis, with the center at the midpoint. Let me confirm.\n\nIf the radius is 2, then the diameter AB is 4 units long. Let me place point A at (-2, 0), point B at (2, 0), and the semicircle is the upper half of the circle with center at the origin (0,0). Then, each point Cᵢ is equally spaced along the semicircle. Since the semicircle is divided into seven equal arcs, each arc is π/7 radians. Therefore, starting from point A (-2,0), moving counterclockwise by π/7 radians gets us to C₁, then another π/7 to C₂, etc., until we reach B at (2, 0).\n\nBut wait, starting from A, which is at angle π radians (since it's on the left end of the diameter), moving by π/7 each time. So the angles for each point Cᵢ can be calculated. Let me think.\n\nIf we consider angles in standard position (from the positive x-axis), then point A is at angle π, and point B is at angle 0 (or 2π). But since we're moving from A to B along the semicircle, which is π radians, each of the seven arcs is π/7 radians. Therefore, the points C₁ to C₆ are located at angles π - k*(π/7) for k=1,...,6? Wait, no. Wait, starting at A (angle π), moving towards B (angle 0). So each step is subtracting π/7. Therefore, the angle for C₁ is π - π/7 = 6π/7, then C₂ is π - 2π/7 = 5π/7, C₃ is π - 3π/7 = 4π/7, C₄ is π - 4π/7 = 3π/7, C₅ is π - 5π/7 = 2π/7, and C₆ is π - 6π/7 = π/7. Wait, but π/7 is still on the semicircle? Wait, π/7 is less than π/2, so yes, it's on the upper semicircle. Wait, but π/7 is from the positive x-axis? Wait, if we started at π radians (point A), and subtract π/7 each time, then C₁ is at 6π/7, which is in the second quadrant, moving towards the first quadrant. Then C₆ is at π - 6*(π/7) = π - 6π/7 = π/7, which is in the first quadrant. So yes, all points are on the upper semicircle. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, each point Cᵢ is at angle θ_i = π - i*(π/7) = π*(1 - i/7) for i = 1,...,6. Alternatively, θ_i = π*( (7 - i)/7 ). Alternatively, if I think of them as angles from the positive x-axis, they are π/7, 2π/7, 3π/7, 4π/7, 5π/7, 6π/7. Wait, but if we start at A (π radians) and go towards B (0 radians), then the angles decrease from π to 0. However, if we think of them as angles from the positive x-axis, they go from π down to π/7, but π/7 is still a positive angle measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. So maybe it's easier to think of the points as located at angles π/7, 2π/7, ..., 6π/7. Wait, but that would be starting from the positive x-axis and going counterclockwise. But our points are starting from A at (-2, 0) and going towards B at (2, 0). So perhaps there's a symmetry here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the central angles between A and each Cᵢ, and between B and each Cᵢ.\n\nLet me think. Let's fix coordinate system: center at (0,0), radius 2, A at (-2, 0), B at (2, 0). The points C₁ to C₆ are on the semicircle from A to B, equally spaced. So each arc between consecutive points is π/7 radians. Therefore, the central angle between A and C₁ is π/7 radians. Similarly, between A and C₂ is 2π/7, and so on up to between A and C₆ is 6π/7. Similarly, the central angle between B and C₆ is π - 6π/7 = π/7. Similarly, between B and C₅ is 2π/7, etc. Wait, let me check.\n\nThe central angle between B and C₆: since C₆ is at angle π/7 from the positive x-axis. The central angle between B (which is at angle 0) and C₆ is π/7. Similarly, the central angle between B and C₅ is 2π/7, since C₅ is at angle 2π/7. Wait, no. Wait, if C₁ is at angle 6π/7 from the positive x-axis, then the angle between A (which is at π radians) and C₁ is π - 6π/7 = π/7. Similarly, the angle between B (which is at 0 radians) and C₆ (which is at π/7 radians) is π/7. So yes, the central angles for ACᵢ and BCᵢ are both i*(π/7) for i=1,...,6? Wait, for ACᵢ, the central angle is i*(π/7), and for BCᵢ, since Cᵢ is located at angle π - i*(π/7) from the positive x-axis? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of each point Cᵢ. Let me index them from left to right. So starting at A (-2, 0), moving towards B (2, 0). So C₁ is the first division, closest to A. The central angle between A and C₁ is π/7. Then between A and C₂ is 2π/7, etc. So for each Cᵢ, the central angle between A and Cᵢ is i*(π/7). Similarly, the central angle between B and Cᵢ would be π - i*(π/7). Wait, because the total semicircle is π radians. So if from A to Cᵢ is i*(π/7), then from Cᵢ to B is π - i*(π/7). Therefore, the central angle between B and Cᵢ is π - i*(π/7). Therefore, the chord lengths ACᵢ and BCᵢ would be:\n\nLength of ACᵢ: 2r sin( (iπ/7)/2 ) = 4 sin( iπ/14 )\n\nSimilarly, length of BCᵢ: 2r sin( (π - iπ/7)/2 ) = 4 sin( π/2 - iπ/14 ) = 4 cos( iπ/14 )\n\nBecause sin(π/2 - x) = cos(x). So that simplifies it.\n\nTherefore, for each i from 1 to 6, the chord ACᵢ has length 4 sin( iπ/14 ), and chord BCᵢ has length 4 cos( iπ/14 ). Therefore, the product n is the product over i=1 to 6 of [4 sin(iπ/14) * 4 cos(iπ/14)].\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, for each i, we have two chords: ACᵢ and BCᵢ. So for each i, multiply their lengths, and then multiply over all i=1,...,6.\n\nBut 4 sin(iπ/14) * 4 cos(iπ/14) = 16 sin(iπ/14) cos(iπ/14) = 8 sin(2iπ/14) = 8 sin(iπ/7). Wait, because sin(2x) = 2 sinx cosx. Therefore, sinx cosx = (1/2) sin2x. Therefore, 4*4 sinx cosx = 16 sinx cosx = 8 sin2x.\n\nTherefore, the product n becomes the product over i=1 to 6 of 8 sin(iπ/7). Wait, no: 8 sin(2*(iπ/14))? Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal expression: for each chord ACᵢ and BCᵢ, their lengths are 4 sin(iπ/14) and 4 cos(iπ/14). Therefore, their product is 16 sin(iπ/14) cos(iπ/14) = 8 sin(2*(iπ/14)) = 8 sin(iπ/7). Therefore, n is the product from i=1 to 6 of 8 sin(iπ/7). Therefore, n = 8^6 * product_{i=1}^6 sin(iπ/7).\n\nSo, n = 8^6 * [product_{i=1}^6 sin(iπ/7)].\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the product of sines, then multiply by 8^6, and then take mod 1000.\n\nSo, first compute 8^6. Let me compute that. 8^2 is 64, 8^3 is 512, 8^4 is 4096, 8^5 is 32768, 8^6 is 262144. So 8^6 = 262144.\n\nNow, need to compute product_{i=1}^6 sin(iπ/7). Let me recall if there is a formula for the product of sines of the form sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1. Wait, there are some known products. For example, the product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}. Wait, is that correct? Let me check for small n. For n=2: product is sin(π/2) = 1. Formula gives 2 / 2^{1} = 1. Correct. For n=3: product sin(π/3) sin(2π/3) = (√3/2)(√3/2) = 3/4. Formula gives 3 / 2^{2} = 3/4. Correct. For n=4: product sin(π/4) sin(2π/4) sin(3π/4) = (√2/2)(1)(√2/2) = (2/4)(1) = 1/2. Formula gives 4 / 2^3 = 4/8 = 1/2. Correct. So yes, seems like the formula is product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}.\n\nTherefore, for our case, n=7, product_{k=1}^6 sin(kπ/7) = 7 / 2^6 = 7 / 64.\n\nWait, so then our product [product_{i=1}^6 sin(iπ/7)] is 7/64.\n\nTherefore, n = 8^6 * (7/64) = 8^6 / 8^2 * 7 = 8^{4} * 7 = 4096 * 7. Wait, let me compute that.\n\nWait, 8^6 is 262144, and 262144 * 7 / 64? Wait, no. Wait, original expression:\n\nn = 8^6 * [7 / 64] = (8^6 / 64) * 7 = 8^(6 - 3) * 7 = 8^3 * 7 = 512 * 7 = 3584.\n\nWait, 8^6 divided by 64 is 8^6 / 8^2 = 8^4 = 4096. Then 4096 * 7 = 28672. Wait, which is correct?\n\nWait, 8^6 is 262144. Divided by 64 is 262144 / 64. Let me compute 262144 ÷ 64:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 262144 ÷ 16 = 16384; 64 ÷ 16 = 4. So 16384 / 4 = 4096. Then 4096 * 7 = 28672. So n = 28672.\n\nWait, so according to this, n is 28,672. Therefore, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 28672 mod 1000. Since 1000*28 = 28,000, subtract that from 28,672: 28,672 - 28,000 = 672. Therefore, the remainder is 672. So is that the answer? Wait, but let me check my steps again, because this seems straightforward, but maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nFirst, the product formula: product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}. For n=7, product_{k=1}^6 sin(kπ/7) = 7 / 2^6 = 7/64. Then n = 8^6 * 7 / 64. Since 8^6 is (2^3)^6 = 2^18, and 64 is 2^6, so 2^18 / 2^6 = 2^12 = 4096. Then 4096 * 7 is indeed 28672. Then 28672 mod 1000 is 672. Therefore, answer is 672? But let me check again if my reasoning was correct.\n\nWait, but why is the product of sines 7 / 64? Let me confirm that formula again. The formula says that for the product from k=1 to n-1 of sin(kπ/n) equals n / 2^{n-1}. So for n=7, yes, product is 7 / 2^6 = 7/64. So that seems correct. Therefore, multiplying by 8^6 gives us 8^6 * 7 / 2^6 = (8/2)^6 * 7 = 4^6 * 7. Wait, 4^6 is 4096? Wait 4^3 is 64, 4^4 is 256, 4^5 is 1024, 4^6 is 4096. Yes. So 4096 * 7 is 28672. Therefore, 28672 mod 1000. Since 1000*28 = 28,000, 28672 - 28,000 = 672. So the answer is 672. But wait, let me check again.\n\nBut hold on, the problem says that the semicircular arc is divided into seven congruent arcs by six equally spaced points. So each arc is π/7. Therefore, the central angles between A and C_i are i*(π/7). But when we calculated the chord lengths, we said that AC_i corresponds to central angle i*(π/7), so chord length is 2r sin(theta/2) = 4 sin(iπ/14). Similarly, BC_i corresponds to central angle π - i*(π/7), which is (7π - iπ)/7 = π*(7 - i)/7. Therefore, half of that angle is π*(7 - i)/14. Therefore, chord length BC_i is 4 sin( π*(7 - i)/14 ) = 4 sin( π/2 - iπ/14 ) = 4 cos(iπ/14). Therefore, the product for each i is 4 sin(iπ/14) * 4 cos(iπ/14) = 16 sin(iπ/14) cos(iπ/14) = 8 sin(iπ/7). Therefore, the total product is product_{i=1}^6 8 sin(iπ/7) = 8^6 * product_{i=1}^6 sin(iπ/7). Then product_{i=1}^6 sin(iπ/7) is 7 / 2^6, so total product is 8^6 * 7 / 2^6 = (8/2)^6 * 7 = 4^6 * 7 = 4096 * 7 = 28672. Therefore, 28672 mod 1000 is 672. Therefore, answer is 672. But let me check with another approach to be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the product of sines numerically? Let me try that. Let me compute product_{k=1}^6 sin(kπ/7). Let me calculate each term:\n\nFirst, sin(π/7), sin(2π/7), sin(3π/7), sin(4π/7), sin(5π/7), sin(6π/7). Note that sin(4π/7) = sin(π - 3π/7) = sin(3π/7), similarly sin(5π/7)=sin(2π/7), sin(6π/7)=sin(π/7). Therefore, the product is [sin(π/7) sin(2π/7) sin(3π/7)]^2. Therefore, if I can compute sin(π/7) sin(2π/7) sin(3π/7), then square it. There is a known formula for sin(π/7) sin(2π/7) sin(3π/7) = √7 / 8. Let me check that. If that's true, then the product would be (√7 / 8)^2 = 7 / 64, which matches our previous result. Therefore, that confirms the product of sines is indeed 7/64. Therefore, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, n = 28672. Therefore, 28672 divided by 1000 is 28 with remainder 672. Therefore, the answer is 672.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the formula for the product of sines is indeed applicable here. The formula is for product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}. So for n=7, product from k=1 to 6 is 7 / 2^6 = 7/64. Therefore, yes, and since we have product_{i=1}^6 sin(iπ/7) = 7/64. Therefore, the previous steps are correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there is a chance that I misapplied the chord length formula. The chord length between two points with central angle θ is 2r sin(θ/2). In our case, radius is 2, so chord length is 4 sin(θ/2). For AC_i, θ is iπ/7, so chord length is 4 sin(iπ/14). For BC_i, θ is π - iπ/7, so chord length is 4 sin( (π - iπ/7)/2 ) = 4 sin( π/2 - iπ/14 ) = 4 cos(iπ/14). Therefore, multiplying them gives 16 sin(iπ/14) cos(iπ/14) = 8 sin(iπ/7). Therefore, product over i=1 to 6 gives 8^6 times product of sin(iπ/7). All steps seem correct.\n\nTherefore, I think 672 is the correct answer. However, to be 100% sure, maybe compute n step by step?\n\nBut 28672 is a manageable number. Let me compute 8^6 * 7 / 64 again:\n\n8^6 is 262144. Divided by 64 is 262144 / 64. Let me divide 262144 by 64:\n\nFirst, 64 * 4000 = 256000.\n\n262144 - 256000 = 6144.\n\nNow, 64 * 96 = 6144. Therefore, total is 4000 + 96 = 4096. Then 4096 * 7 = ?\n\nWell, 4000 * 7 = 28000, 96 * 7 = 672. Therefore, total is 28000 + 672 = 28672. Correct. Therefore, 28672 mod 1000 is 672.\n\nTherefore, answer is 672. However, to be thorough, maybe check with another approach?\n\nAlternatively, think complex numbers. Let me consider roots of unity. The points on the semicircle correspond to certain roots of unity. Let me think.\n\nBut perhaps overcomplicating. Alternatively, think about polynomials whose roots are related to the sines.\n\nBut since we already have two confirmations: one via known formula for product of sines, another via numerical evaluation (though not numerically calculated but via known identities), I think the answer is correct.\n\nBut let me check with n=7, product_{k=1}^6 sin(kπ/7) = 7/64. Let me compute approximate value numerically.\n\nCompute sin(π/7) ≈ sin(25.714°) ≈ 0.433884\n\nsin(2π/7) ≈ sin(51.428°) ≈ 0.781832\n\nsin(3π/7) ≈ sin(77.142°) ≈ 0.974370\n\nsin(4π/7) = sin(3π/7) ≈ 0.974370\n\nsin(5π/7) = sin(2π/7) ≈ 0.781832\n\nsin(6π/7) = sin(π/7) ≈ 0.433884\n\nTherefore, the product is [0.433884 * 0.781832 * 0.974370]^2.\n\nFirst compute 0.433884 * 0.781832 ≈ 0.433884 * 0.781832 ≈ let me calculate:\n\n0.4 * 0.78 = 0.312, 0.033884 * 0.78 ≈ ~0.0264, 0.4 * 0.001832 ≈ 0.00073, and so on. But better to approximate:\n\nLet me use calculator-like approximations:\n\n0.433884 * 0.781832 ≈ approx 0.4339 * 0.7818 ≈\n\nMultiply 0.4339 * 0.7818:\n\nFirst compute 0.4 * 0.7818 = 0.31272\n\n0.03 * 0.7818 = 0.023454\n\n0.0039 * 0.7818 ≈ 0.003049\n\nAdding up: 0.31272 + 0.023454 ≈ 0.33617 + 0.003049 ≈ 0.3392.\n\nThen multiply by 0.97437:\n\nWait no, first multiply 0.4339 * 0.7818 ≈ approx 0.3392, then multiply by 0.97437:\n\n0.3392 * 0.97437 ≈ 0.3392*(1 - 0.02563) ≈ 0.3392 - 0.3392*0.02563 ≈ 0.3392 - approx 0.0087 ≈ 0.3305.\n\nTherefore, the product [0.433884 * 0.781832 * 0.974370] ≈ approx 0.3305. Then square it: approx 0.1092. Now, 7 / 64 ≈ 0.109375. Which is very close to 0.1092. Therefore, this numerical approximation confirms that the product is approximately 0.109375 = 7/64. Therefore, our formula is correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 672.\n\nBut just to check, maybe there is a miscalculation in translating chord lengths? Let me check with specific i.\n\nTake i=1: chord AC₁ has central angle π/7, length 4 sin(π/14). Chord BC₁ has central angle π - π/7 = 6π/7, but wait, chord length is 2r sin(theta/2). Theta is 6π/7, so chord length is 4 sin(3π/7). Alternatively, as we had earlier, 4 cos(π/14). Since sin(3π/7) = sin(π/2 + 2π/14) = cos(2π/14) ? Wait, sin(π/2 + x) = cos(x). Wait, 3π/7 = π/2 - π/14? Let me check:\n\nπ/2 is 7π/14. 3π/7 is 6π/14. So π/2 - π/14 = 7π/14 - π/14 = 6π/14 = 3π/7. Therefore, sin(3π/7) = sin(π/2 - π/14) = cos(π/14). Therefore, chord BC₁ is 4 cos(π/14). Therefore, product is 4 sin(π/14) * 4 cos(π/14) = 8 sin(π/7). Which is consistent with our previous result. Therefore, yes, the product for each i is 8 sin(iπ/7). Therefore, the total product is 8^6 times product sin(iπ/7). Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, I think confident that 672 is the correct answer. Therefore, the remainder when n is divided by 1000 is 672.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{672}\n</think>"}
