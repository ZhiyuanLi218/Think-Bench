So, there are two identical capacitors connected in parallel, and we need to determine which quantities are the same for both. The options are charge, voltage, capacitance. The choices are given as I, II, III, and the options are combinations of them. \n\nFirst, let me recall what happens when capacitors are connected in parallel. In a parallel connection, the voltage across each capacitor should be the same because they are both connected to the same two points in the circuit. So if they're in parallel, the voltage across each one has to be equal. That seems right because voltage is the potential difference between two points, and if they're both connected across the same points, they must have the same voltage. So that would mean statement II is true. \n\nNow, what about the charge stored on each capacitor? If the capacitors are identical, meaning they have the same capacitance, and they are in parallel with the same voltage, then the charge on each should be Q = C * V. Since both C and V are the same for both capacitors, then Q should be the same. Wait, but hold on. Wait, if they are identical and in parallel, then yes, same voltage, same capacitance, so same charge. But the question is asking which quantities \"must be the same\". But wait, are they necessarily identical? The problem says they are identical capacitors. So if they are identical, their capacitance is the same. So III would also be true? Because the capacitance is a property of the capacitor itself, right? So if they are identical capacitors, their capacitance is the same regardless of how they're connected. So III is definitely true. \n\nBut wait, the question is about which quantities must be the same when they are hooked in parallel. So for capacitors in parallel, the voltage is same, and since they are identical, their capacitance is same, so charge would also be same. But if they weren't identical, meaning different capacitances, then even in parallel, voltage would be same, but charge would differ. But since the problem says they are identical, then all three would be same? But the options don't have an option where all three are same. Wait, let me check again. The options are:\n\nA: I only\n\nB: II only\n\nC: II and III only\n\nD: (E) I, II, and III. Wait, maybe there was a typo, but assuming D is II and III, and E is all three? Wait the original question says:\n\nA:I only \n\nB:II only \n\nC:II and III only \n\nD:(E) I, II, and III\n\nPossibly a formatting error, but assuming that D is missing and E is the last option. But regardless, according to my reasoning, if they are identical capacitors in parallel, then all three quantities must be same. However, let me think again. Let me check each one.\n\nFirst, capacitance (III). Capacitance is determined by the physical characteristics of the capacitor: the area of the plates, the distance between them, and the dielectric constant. Since they are identical capacitors, their capacitance is same regardless of how they are connected. So III is definitely true.\n\nVoltage (II): For capacitors in parallel, the voltage across each is same as the voltage of the source. So yes, same voltage. So II is true.\n\nCharge (I): Since Q = C * V, if both C and V are same, then Q must be same. Therefore I is also true. So all three are same. But looking at the answer options, if there is an option E which is I, II, III, then that would be the answer. However, the original options given here are A, B, C, D where D is labeled as \"(E) I, II, and III\". Maybe it's a typo. Assuming that the intended options are up to C and D is a mistake. But according to standard multiple-choice labels, if the options are A to D, and D is supposed to be III only or something else?\n\nWait the original question says:\n\nA:I only \n\nB:II only \n\nC:II and III only \n\nD:(E) I, II, and III\n\nPossibly a formatting error where D was supposed to be \"III only\" but got mixed up. However, given that D is labeled as \"(E) I, II, and III\", maybe in the original question, there was a D and E, but here it's mistyped. Assuming that the correct answer is C: II and III only? But according to my reasoning, if the capacitors are identical, then I is also same. But maybe there is a case where even with identical capacitors in parallel, the charge isn't necessarily same? Wait, no. If they are in parallel, same voltage, same capacitance, so same charge. Unless there is something else. Wait, but suppose the capacitors are connected in parallel but with different charges? But in reality, when you connect capacitors in parallel, they end up with same voltage. If they started with different charges, there would be a redistribution of charge until voltage is same. But if they are identical and connected in parallel to a circuit, say, a battery, then they would charge up to same voltage and same charge. So if they are hooked in parallel, meaning connected to an external circuit, which I assume is a voltage source, then yes, their charges would be same. \n\nBut wait, maybe the question is implying that they are connected in parallel but not necessarily connected to a voltage source? Wait, the question says \"hooked in parallel to an external circuit\". Hmm. Not sure. But generally, when capacitors are in parallel in a circuit, they share the same voltage. \n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"two identical capacitors are hooked in parallel to an external circuit\". So maybe the external circuit is providing some voltage. So regardless of what the external circuit is doing, as long as they are in parallel, the voltage across each is same. Since they are identical, same capacitance. Therefore, charge would be same. Therefore all three? But then why isn't that an option? Wait looking back, the options given here are A, B, C, D where D is \"(E) I, II, and III\". Maybe that's supposed to be option D? If so, then answer is D. However, if in the original question, option C is II and III only, and there is no option for all three, then maybe my reasoning is wrong. Wait let me check standard capacitor rules. \n\nIn parallel: voltage same, charge adds up. Each capacitor has same voltage. For identical capacitors, same voltage and same capacitance implies same charge. So I, II, III are all same. However, if capacitors are not identical, then only II (voltage) is same. But since the capacitors here are identical, then I, II, III are same. Therefore, the correct answer should be E if it's an option. But according to the given options here, the user lists D as \"(E) I, II, and III\". So assuming that D is the correct choice here, meaning all three. But looking at standard tests like AP or SAT, sometimes there is a possibility that the answer is C. Wait why? Let me think again. \n\nWait, capacitance (III) is a property of the capacitor. So even if they were not connected in parallel, the capacitance would still be same. So regardless of the connection, the capacitance is same. So III is always true. The question is which quantities \"must be the same for both capacitors\". Since they are identical, their capacitance must be same regardless of how they are connected. So III is definitely true. \n\nVoltage (II): When connected in parallel, the voltage must be same. So II is true. \n\nCharge (I): Only if voltage is same and capacitance is same, then charge is same. But if they were connected in series, even if they are identical, voltage would split, so charge same but voltage different. But in this case, they are connected in parallel, so voltage same, and since they are identical, charge same. So in this specific scenario, I is true. \n\nTherefore, all three are true. Hence, answer is E (or D in the given options). But the options here are listed as A, B, C, D where D is \"(E) I, II, and III\". So probably there was a typo and D is supposed to be the correct answer with all three. Therefore, the answer is D (as labeled here). However, in standard multiple-choice labeling, sometimes options are A through E. Given the confusion, but based on reasoning, all three quantities must be same. \n\nBut let me check an example. Suppose two identical capacitors, each of capacitance C, connected in parallel to a battery of voltage V. Each capacitor has voltage V across it. Charge on each is Q = C*V. So both have same charge. So yes, I, II, III. Therefore answer should be all three. Hence, if the options include that, it's correct. Given that in the user's question, option D is labeled as \"(E) I, II, and III\", I think that is the intended correct answer. Therefore, the answer is D (or E, depending on actual options). Since in the given options here, D is that, then answer is D. \n\nBut wait, let me check another angle. Suppose someone might think that when connected in parallel, the charge could be different? No, because Q=CV, and if C and V are same, Q must be same. So I think the correct answer is all three. Hence, D (or E). Given that, I think the answer is D as per the user's options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
