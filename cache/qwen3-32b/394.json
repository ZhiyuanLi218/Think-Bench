The circles have radii 4, 6, and 7. Let me try to visualize this. Since they are concentric, they all share the same center. The Asymptote code shows that the largest circle (radius 7) is light gray, the middle one (radius 6) is gray, and the smallest one (radius 4) is white. The regions labeled X, Y, Z are probably the annular regions between the circles. Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking at the labels: X is near (2,0), which is inside the smallest circle (radius 4). But wait, the smallest circle is filled white. However, since the next circle is gray, maybe X is the innermost circle? Wait, but the problem says there are three regions labeled X, Y, Z. If there are three circles, there are three regions: the innermost circle, the annulus between radius 4 and 6, and the annulus between 6 and 7. So maybe X, Y, Z correspond to these three regions? The labels are placed at (2,0), (5,0), and (6.5,0). Let me think: (2,0) is inside the circle of radius 4, since 2 < 4. (5,0) is between 4 and 6, since 4 < 5 < 6. And (6.5, 0) is between 6 and 7, since 6 < 6.5 < 7. Therefore, X is the innermost circle (radius 4), Y is the annulus between 4 and 6, and Z is the annulus between 6 and 7. \n\nSo the problem is asking for the difference between the largest area and the smallest area among X, Y, Z. So I need to compute the areas of X, Y, Z, then subtract the smallest from the largest.\n\nFirst, let's compute the area of X. Since X is the innermost circle with radius 4, its area is π*(4)^2 = 16π.\n\nNext, Y is the annulus between radius 4 and 6. The area of an annulus is π*(R^2 - r^2), where R is the outer radius and r is the inner radius. So for Y, R = 6 and r = 4. Therefore, area Y = π*(6^2 - 4^2) = π*(36 - 16) = 20π.\n\nThen Z is the annulus between radius 6 and 7. Using the same formula, R = 7 and r = 6. Area Z = π*(7^2 - 6^2) = π*(49 - 36) = 13π.\n\nWait, so the areas are X: 16π, Y: 20π, Z: 13π. Therefore, the largest area is Y (20π) and the smallest is Z (13π). The difference would be 20π - 13π = 7π. But hold on, let me check again. Wait, X is 16π, Y is 20π, Z is 13π. So the largest is Y (20π) and the smallest is Z (13π). The difference is 7π. But let me make sure I didn't mix up the regions. The problem says \"three regions labeled X, Y, or Z\". The Asymptote code fills the largest circle (radius 7) as light gray, then the middle circle (radius 6) as gray, and the smallest (radius 4) as white. So if you have three regions: the innermost circle (radius 4) is white, then between 4 and 6 is gray, and between 6 and 7 is light gray. The labels X, Y, Z are placed in those regions. So X is the white one (radius 4), Y is the middle gray (between 4 and 6), Z is the outer light gray (between 6 and 7). Therefore, my calculations above are correct: X=16π, Y=20π, Z=13π. Wait, hold on, Z is 13π? That's smaller than X. So the areas from smallest to largest would be Z (13π), X (16π), Y (20π). Therefore, the largest area is Y (20π) and the smallest is Z (13π). The difference is 20π - 13π = 7π. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check the area calculations again. Maybe I made an arithmetic error. For Z, between 6 and 7: area is π*(7² - 6²) = π*(49 - 36) = π*13, yes, that's 13π. For Y, between 4 and 6: π*(6² - 4²) = π*(36 - 16) = 20π. For X, area is π*4²=16π. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the difference between the largest (Y: 20π) and smallest (Z:13π) is 7π. \n\nBut hold on, let me think again. The problem says \"the difference between the area of the region with the greatest area and the area of the region with the smallest area\". So if Y is the largest (20π) and Z is the smallest (13π), then yes, 20π - 13π is 7π. But let me check if maybe X is considered a region, but maybe I misread the problem. The problem says three regions labeled X, Y, Z. The Asymptote code draws three circles, with the innermost white, middle gray, and outer light gray. Therefore, the three regions are: inner circle (X), middle annulus (Y), outer annulus (Z). Therefore, my previous conclusion holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another way the regions are divided? For example, maybe X, Y, Z are different? Let me check the Asymptote code again:\n\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),7), lightgray, black+linewidth(1));\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),6), gray, black+linewidth(1));\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),4), white, black+linewidth(1));\ndot((0,0));\nlabel(\"$X$\",(2,0));\nlabel(\"$Y$\",(5,0));\nlabel(\"$Z$\",(6.5,0));\n\nSo the largest circle (radius 7) is filled lightgray, then the middle circle (radius 6) is filled gray over top of it, and the smallest circle (radius 4) is filled white over top of the gray. So the regions:\n\n- The innermost circle (radius 4) is white, labeled X.\n\n- The region between radius 4 and 6 is gray, since the middle circle is filled gray, covering that annulus. This is labeled Y at (5,0).\n\n- The region between radius 6 and 7 is light gray, since the largest circle is filled light gray, covering that annulus. This is labeled Z at (6.5, 0).\n\nTherefore, the areas:\n\nX: π*(4)^2 = 16π.\n\nY: π*(6)^2 - π*(4)^2 = 36π - 16π = 20π.\n\nZ: π*(7)^2 - π*(6)^2 = 49π - 36π = 13π.\n\nSo, yes, same as before. Then the areas are X=16π, Y=20π, Z=13π. Therefore, the greatest area is Y (20π) and the smallest is Z (13π). The difference is 20π - 13π = 7π. \n\nBut wait, hold on! The problem says \"the difference between the area of the region with the greatest area and the area of the region with the smallest area\". But according to this, the difference is 7π. However, let me check once more if maybe the labels are different? For example, maybe Z is the outermost, but perhaps I miscalculated? Let me check again:\n\nArea of Z (between 6 and 7): π*(7² - 6²) = π*(49 - 36) = π*13. Correct. 13π.\n\nArea of X: 16π. Area of Y: 20π. So the order is Z (13π) < X (16π) < Y (20π). Therefore, difference between Y and Z is 7π. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers the regions differently? For example, if X, Y, Z are not the three regions as I thought. Maybe there are other regions? Wait, with three circles, there are three regions: the inner disk, the middle annulus, and the outer annulus. So three regions total. The problem says \"Of these three regions,...\" so X, Y, Z are those three. The labels are placed in each region, as per the coordinates given. Therefore, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe there's an error in the Asymptote code interpretation? The code fills the largest circle first with lightgray, then fills the middle circle with gray, then fills the smallest circle with white. Therefore:\n\n- The innermost circle (radius 4) is white.\n\n- The area between radius 4 and 6 is gray (since the middle circle is filled gray, covering that area, while the inner circle is white).\n\n- The area between radius 6 and 7 is lightgray (since the largest circle is filled lightgray, covering that area, while the middle circle is gray, which is underneath? Wait, hold on. Wait, when you fill the largest circle (radius 7) with lightgray first, then fill the middle circle (radius 6) with gray. So the middle circle is on top of the largest circle? Or is it filled in addition? Wait, in Asymptote, when you do filldraw, it fills the entire circle. But if you fill a smaller circle over a larger one, then the smaller circle covers part of the larger one. So the order is:\n\n1. Fill the largest circle (radius 7) with lightgray. So the entire area up to radius 7 is lightgray.\n\n2. Then fill the middle circle (radius 6) with gray. Now, the area inside radius 6 is gray, and the area between 6 and 7 remains lightgray.\n\n3. Then fill the innermost circle (radius 4) with white. Now, the area inside radius 4 is white, the area between 4 and 6 is gray, and between 6 and 7 is lightgray. \n\nTherefore, the regions:\n\n- X is inside radius 4 (white).\n\n- Y is between 4 and 6 (gray).\n\n- Z is between 6 and 7 (lightgray).\n\nTherefore, areas as calculated before. Therefore, difference is 7π. \n\nBut let me check once again with numbers:\n\nRadius 4: area π*4²=16π.\n\nRadius 6: area π*6²=36π. Therefore, the annulus between 4 and 6 is 36π - 16π = 20π.\n\nRadius 7: area π*7²=49π. Therefore, the annulus between 6 and 7 is 49π - 36π = 13π.\n\nYes. Therefore, the areas are 16π, 20π, 13π. Therefore, difference between largest (20π) and smallest (13π) is 7π. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7π, written as \\boxed{7\\pi}.\n\nBut let me check once more if maybe there is a miscalculation here. For example, maybe I mixed up the regions? If the problem says \"the difference between the area of the region with the greatest area and the area of the region with the smallest area\", and if the areas are 16π, 20π, 13π, then the greatest is 20π, the smallest is 13π, difference is 7π. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the middle region (Y) is between radius 6 and 7, but according to the labels, Y is at (5,0), which is between 4 and 6. So no, the labels are correctly assigned. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{7\\pi}\n</think>"}
