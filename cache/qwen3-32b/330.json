The question gives me a Hamiltonian involving the Pauli matrices of each atom and asks about the possible states. The options are different combinations of quadruplets and doublets. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about combining spins.\n\nFirst, when you have multiple spin-½ particles, their total spin can be found by successive addition. For two spin-½ particles, you get a triplet (spin 1) and a singlet (spin 0). But here we have three particles. Let me think about how to combine three spin-½ particles.\n\nI remember that combining three spin-½ particles can lead to different total spin states. The possible total spins S can be 3/2 (quadruplet) and 1/2 (doublet). But how many of each?\n\nLet me recall: for three spin-½ particles, the decomposition is usually 4 (quadruplet) + 2 (doublets). Wait, but I need to verify this. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nFirst, combine two spins: spin-½ and spin-½ gives triplet (symmetric) and singlet (antisymmetric). Then combine each of those with another spin-½.\n\nSo first, combine spins 1 and 2: S₁₂ can be 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). Then combine each of these with spin 3.\n\nFor S₁₂ = 1: combining spin 1 with spin ½ gives total spin S = 3/2 (quadruplet) and S = 1/2 (doublet). \n\nFor S₁₂ = 0: combining spin 0 with spin ½ gives total spin S = ½ (doublet).\n\nSo overall, when combining three spin-½ particles, you get:\n\nFrom S₁₂ = 1: one quadruplet (S=3/2) and one doublet (S=1/2).\n\nFrom S₁₂ = 0: one doublet (S=1/2).\n\nTherefore total is one quadruplet and two doublets. But wait, the options here are about quadruplet and doublets. The options given are A: 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets; B: 1 quadruplet and 3 identical doublets; C: 4 doublets; D: 2 quadruplets.\n\nBut according to my calculation, it's one quadruplet and two doublets. But the options don't have that. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the decomposition of three spin-½ particles is 4 + 2 + 2? Wait, the dimensions. For three spin-½ particles, the total Hilbert space is 2^3 = 8 dimensional. The quadruplet is 4-dimensional (S=3/2: 4 states), and then there are two doublets (each 2-dimensional), so 4 + 2 + 2 = 8. So that would mean one quadruplet and two doublets. But the options don't have that. The options given are A: 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets; B: 1 quadruplet and 3 identical doublets; C: 4 doublets; D: 2 quadruplets.\n\nSo according to my calculation, the answer should be A. But wait, the problem mentions the total spin S is given by S = s1 + s2 + s3, and also mentions that s² = 3/4, so each individual spin is ½. Wait, but the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2. However, the question is about the molecular states of the system. But the Hamiltonian given is H = (λ/3)[σ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1]. Maybe the Hamiltonian has different eigenvalues for different total spin states? So perhaps the states split into different energy levels based on their total spin. But the question is about the description of the molecular states, not the energy levels. Wait, but maybe the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the total spin?\n\nLet me think. The Pauli matrices for each spin. Remember that σ_i · σ_j for two spins is related to their total spin squared. Let me recall that for two spins, σ₁·σ₂ = 2s₁·s₂ - something? Wait, more precisely, for two spins, S_total = s₁ + s₂, so S² = (s₁ + s₂)² = s₁² + s₂² + 2 s₁·s₂. Therefore, s₁·s₂ = [S² - s₁² - s₂²]/2. But since s₁ and s₂ are spin-½, s₁² = (½)(½ + 1)ħ², but here they are using units where ħ=1? Wait, but in the problem statement, they mention that s² = 3/4. Since each individual spin is ½, so s(s+1) = ½(½ +1) = 3/4. So yes, they are using units where ħ=1. Therefore, for two spins, σ₁·σ₂ = 2 s₁·s₂ + something? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem defines the spin vector of the molecule as s = σ/2, where σ are Pauli matrices. Wait, hold on. Wait, each atom has spin ½. The spin vector of the molecule is S = s1 + s2 + s3 = ½(σ1 + σ2 + σ3). So each individual spin si is σi/2. Therefore, the Pauli matrices σi are 2 si. Therefore, σi · σj would be (2 si) · (2 sj) = 4 si · sj. Therefore, σi · σj = 4 si · sj. Therefore, the term σ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1 equals 4[ s1·s2 + s2·s3 + s3·s1 ].\n\nBut maybe we can express this in terms of the total spin S. Let me compute S² = (s1 + s2 + s3)^2 = s1² + s2² + s3² + 2(s1·s2 + s1·s3 + s2·s3). Therefore, S² = 3*(3/4) + 2*(s1·s2 + s1·s3 + s2·s3). Therefore, solving for the sum:\n\ns1·s2 + s1·s3 + s2·s3 = [S² - 9/4]/2.\n\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian is:\n\nH = (λ/3)[σ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1] = (λ/3)*4*[s1·s2 + s2·s3 + s3·s1] = (4λ/3)*[ (S² - 9/4)/2 ] = (2λ/3)(S² - 9/4).\n\nSo H is proportional to S². Therefore, the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the total spin basis. Therefore, the energy levels depend only on the total spin S. Therefore, all states with the same total spin S will have the same energy. Therefore, the degeneracy of each energy level is determined by the multiplicity of that total spin.\n\nEarlier, we thought that combining three spin-½ particles gives one quadruplet (S=3/2, 4 states) and two doublets (each S=1/2, 2 states each). So total of 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 states, which matches 2^3=8. Therefore, if the Hamiltonian depends only on S², then the eigenstates are grouped into these multiplets. Therefore, the molecular states consist of one quadruplet and two doublets. However, looking at the options, option A says \"1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets\". Since the two doublets are different in terms of their symmetry or something else? Or are they identical? Wait, in terms of the Hamiltonian, they would have the same energy because they have the same S. But maybe they are different states. However, in terms of the question, which asks for the description of the molecular states, the answer would be one quadruplet and two doublets. However, the options don't have an option with \"1 quadruplet and 2 doublets\". The options given are A, B, C, D. Let me check again:\n\nA: 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets \n\nB: 1 quadruplet and 3 identical doublets \n\nC: 4 doublets \n\nD: 2 quadruplets \n\nSo according to my previous reasoning, the correct answer should be A. But why does it say \"identical doublets\"? Are the two doublets identical? Well, they are both spin-½, so they have the same dimension, but they might belong to different symmetry sectors. However, since the Hamiltonian splits the states based on total spin, and both doublets have the same S=1/2, they would be degenerate. However, the problem is not about energy levels but about the description of the states. So the system has one quadruplet (4 states) and two doublets (each with 2 states). Therefore, the answer is A: 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets. The term \"identical\" here might be referring to the fact that the two doublets are both spin-½, so they have the same spin quantum number. However, in reality, when combining three spins, the two doublets come from different symmetry properties. For example, one doublet is symmetric and the other is antisymmetric or something like that, but they both have S=1/2. So they are \"identical\" in the sense that they have the same spin, but different in terms of symmetry. However, the question might not be concerned with that distinction, just the number and their degeneracy. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me check again if my initial decomposition is correct. Another way to think about combining three spin-½ particles is to use the formula for adding angular momenta. The general formula for adding three spins-½ is:\n\n½ ⊗ ½ ⊗ ½ = (½ ⊗ ½) ⊗ ½ = (1 ⊕ 0) ⊗ ½ = (1 ⊗ ½) ⊕ (0 ⊗ ½) = (3/2 ⊕ 1/2) ⊕ 1/2 = 3/2 ⊕ 1/2 ⊕ 1/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the decomposition is a quadruplet (S=3/2) and two doublets (S=1/2). Therefore, the answer is A. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA: 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets \n\nB: 1 quadruplet and 3 identical doublets \n\nC: 4 doublets \n\nD: 2 quadruplets \n\nTherefore, A is the correct answer. However, I need to make sure that the Hamiltonian doesn't somehow split the two doublets into different energy levels. But earlier, I derived that H is proportional to S². Since both doublets have S=1/2, they will have the same energy. Therefore, they are degenerate. Therefore, in terms of the energy levels, they are identical. However, the question is about the description of the molecular states. The states themselves are different, but they have the same spin quantum number. Therefore, the answer is A: 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets. The term \"identical\" here probably refers to the doublets having the same spin (i.e., both are doublets), even though they might be different states in the Hilbert space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again. Is there another way that the Hamiltonian could affect the states? For example, maybe the Hamiltonian given is not just dependent on S²? Wait, earlier I derived that H is proportional to S². Let me check that again.\n\nStarting from S² = (s1 + s2 + s3)^2 = s1² + s2² + s3² + 2(s1·s2 + s1·s3 + s2·s3). Each s_i² = (½)(½ + 1) = 3/4. Therefore:\n\nS² = 3*(3/4) + 2*(s1·s2 + s1·s3 + s2·s3)\n\nTherefore:\n\ns1·s2 + s1·s3 + s2·s3 = [S² - 9/4]/2\n\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian:\n\nH = (λ/3)[σ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1] \n\nBut σ_i are Pauli matrices, and earlier we defined s_i = σ_i / 2. Therefore σ_i = 2 s_i. Therefore:\n\nσ1·σ2 = 4 s1·s2, similarly for others. Therefore:\n\nσ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1 = 4 [s1·s2 + s2·s3 + s3·s1]\n\nTherefore:\n\nH = (λ/3) * 4 [s1·s2 + s2·s3 + s3·s1] = (4λ/3) * [ (S² - 9/4)/2 ] = (2λ/3)(S² - 9/4)\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore H is proportional to S² minus a constant. Therefore, the energy levels depend only on S². Therefore, all states with the same S will have the same energy. Therefore, the two doublets (S=1/2) are degenerate. Therefore, when the question asks for the description of the molecular states, the answer is that there is one quadruplet and two doublets. Since the two doublets are degenerate (identical in energy), they might be referred to as \"identical doublets\". Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there is any other possibility. For example, sometimes when you have interactions, you can have different states with same spin but different symmetry. However, since the Hamiltonian only depends on S², it doesn't split them. Therefore, in terms of the Hilbert space decomposition, regardless of the Hamiltonian, the states are grouped into one quadruplet and two doublets. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the total number of states is 8. If there is one quadruplet (4 states) and two doublets (2 + 2 = 4 states), that adds up to 8. So that's correct. If there was one quadruplet and three doublets, that would be 4 + 3*2 = 10 states, which is more than 8. So B is wrong. C says 4 doublets, which would be 8 states, but 4 doublets would mean four sets of 2, which is 8, but combining three spins gives only two doublets. D says 2 quadruplets, which would be 8 states, but there's only one quadruplet. So D is wrong. Therefore, A is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
