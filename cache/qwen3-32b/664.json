Hmm, let me think. First, maybe I should expand the expression to make it easier to work with. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with 4(x + 7)(2 - x). Let me first multiply out the two binomials (x + 7)(2 - x). To do that, I can use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for multiplying two binomials. \n\nFirst, multiply the first terms: x * 2 = 2x. Then the outer terms: x * (-x) = -x². Next, the inner terms: 7 * 2 = 14. Finally, the last terms: 7 * (-x) = -7x. So putting that all together:\n\n(x + 7)(2 - x) = 2x - x² + 14 - 7x. \n\nNow combine like terms. The 2x and -7x combine to -5x. So the expression becomes -x² - 5x + 14. \n\nNow, remember we have to multiply this entire expression by 4. So:\n\n4(-x² - 5x + 14) = -4x² - 20x + 56.\n\nOkay, so the original expression simplifies to a quadratic equation: -4x² - 20x + 56. Since this is a quadratic function in the form of ax² + bx + c, where a = -4, b = -20, and c = 56. \n\nNow, since the coefficient of x² is negative (-4), the parabola opens downward, which means it has a maximum value at its vertex. So, the maximum value of the quadratic function is at its vertex. \n\nTo find the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the formula -b/(2a). Let me plug in the values here. \n\nGiven a = -4, b = -20:\n\nx = -(-20)/(2*(-4)) = 20 / (-8) = -2.5. \n\nWait, let me check that again. The formula is -b/(2a). So substituting:\n\nx = -(-20)/(2*(-4)) = 20 / (-8) = -2.5. Yes, that's correct. So the x-coordinate of the vertex is -2.5. \n\nNow, to find the maximum value of the function, we need to plug this x back into the quadratic equation. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let me write the quadratic equation again: -4x² - 20x + 56. Let me substitute x = -2.5 into this. \n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the original expression before expanding? Let me see. Maybe not. Let me just go ahead with the expanded form. \n\nSo x = -2.5. Let me compute each term step by step. \n\nFirst term: -4x². Let's compute x² first. (-2.5)² = 6.25. Then multiply by -4: -4 * 6.25 = -25. \n\nSecond term: -20x. x is -2.5, so -20*(-2.5) = 50. \n\nThird term: 56. \n\nSo adding them all up: -25 + 50 + 56. Let's compute that. \n\n-25 + 50 is 25. Then 25 + 56 is 81. \n\nSo the maximum value is 81? Let me verify this with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use calculus. If I take the derivative of the function and set it to zero to find critical points. Let me try that. \n\nGiven f(x) = -4x² -20x +56. The derivative f’(x) is -8x -20. Setting this equal to zero:\n\n-8x -20 = 0  \n-8x = 20  \nx = 20 / (-8) = -2.5. \n\nSame result as before. So that's consistent. Then plugging back into f(x) gives 81. So that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use completing the square? Let me try that method as well. \n\nStarting with f(x) = -4x² -20x +56. Let me factor out the coefficient of x² from the first two terms:\n\nf(x) = -4(x² + 5x) +56. Wait, because -4 times x² is -4x², so to factor out -4 from -4x² -20x, we have:\n\n-4(x² + 5x) +56. Wait, because -4*(x² + 5x) = -4x² -20x. Correct. \n\nNow, to complete the square inside the parentheses. The coefficient of x is 5. Take half of that, which is 5/2, and square it: (5/2)² = 25/4. \n\nSo we add and subtract 25/4 inside the parentheses:\n\nf(x) = -4[ x² + 5x + 25/4 - 25/4 ] +56  \n= -4[ (x + 5/2)² - 25/4 ] +56  \n= -4(x + 5/2)² + 25 +56  \nBecause distributing the -4: -4*(x + 5/2)^2 + (-4)*(-25/4) +56  \nWhich is -4(x + 5/2)^2 +25 +56. \n\nCalculating 25 + 56 = 81. Therefore, f(x) = -4(x + 5/2)^2 +81. \n\nSince the square term is always non-negative, multiplying by -4 makes it non-positive. Therefore, the maximum value occurs when the square term is zero, i.e., when x + 5/2 = 0 => x = -5/2 = -2.5. And then the maximum value is 81. \n\nSo all three methods: expanding and using vertex formula, calculus, and completing the square, give me the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the maximum value of the original expression is 81. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check by plugging x = -2.5 into the original expression without expanding. \n\nOriginal expression: 4(x + 7)(2 - x). \n\nCompute (x + 7) when x = -2.5: -2.5 +7 = 4.5. \n\nCompute (2 - x) when x = -2.5: 2 - (-2.5) = 2 + 2.5 = 4.5. \n\nMultiply those two results: 4.5 * 4.5 = 20.25. Then multiply by 4: 4 * 20.25 = 81. \n\nYes! Same result. So that's consistent. Therefore, regardless of the method, the maximum value is indeed 81. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 81. \n\nBut just to make sure there isn't any trick or anything I missed. Let me think again. The problem says \"over all real numbers x\". Since it's a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, it's a parabola opening downward, so there is indeed a maximum. And we found that maximum correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a product of two linear terms. The original expression is 4(x + 7)(2 - x). Let me note that (x + 7)(2 - x) is a quadratic as well, which when multiplied by 4 gives another quadratic. The maximum of a quadratic is straightforward as we did. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using AM-GM inequality? Although since there is a negative sign involved, it's not straightforward. Let me see. \n\nBut since (x + 7)(2 - x) can be written as -(x + 7)(x - 2). So maybe not helpful for AM-GM. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps substituting variables. Let me set y = x + something. But maybe not necessary here. \n\nAlternatively, think of the expression as a function and analyze its graph. But since we already did calculus and vertex formula, and completing the square, which all confirm the maximum is 81, I think that's solid. \n\nTherefore, I think the maximum value is 81. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum value is \\boxed{81}.\n</think>"}
