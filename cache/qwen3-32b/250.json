The problem is about a charged particle moving from a stronger magnetic field region to a weaker one. The magnetic fields in both regions are parallel in direction, so the direction of the magnetic field doesn't change, only the magnitude. The particle's velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, and we're neglecting gravity. The question is about what happens to the orbit radius and angular velocity when the particle moves into the weaker field. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant formulas for the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field. When a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it undergoes uniform circular motion. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force. The formula for the radius of the orbit is r = (mv)/(qB), where m is the mass, v is the velocity, q is the charge, and B is the magnetic induction (magnetic field strength). The angular velocity, also called cyclotron frequency, is given by ω = v/r, but substituting the radius formula, ω = (qB)/m. Wait, so angular velocity depends on B, right? And radius depends inversely on B if the velocity is constant. But wait, does the velocity change when moving between the regions? The problem says to neglect gravity, but is there any other force acting on the particle?\n\nSince the magnetic field changes abruptly between the two regions, but the particle is moving from one to the other. Now, when the particle crosses the boundary, does its velocity change? Because magnetic fields can't do work on charged particles, so the speed should remain constant. The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity, so it can't change the speed, only the direction. Therefore, the speed v remains the same. But the magnetic field strength B is changing here. So, if B decreases (moving from stronger to weaker field), then the radius r = mv/(qB) would increase because B is smaller. So orbit radius increases. \n\nNow for angular velocity. The angular velocity ω = qB/m. If B decreases, then ω decreases. So angular velocity decreases. So the orbit radius increases and angular velocity decreases. Let me check the options again. Option B is \"Orbit radius increases, angular velocity decreases\". So answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the motion is circular. The key here is that the velocity magnitude remains the same because the magnetic field can't do work. So when the particle enters the weaker field, the radius increases. Angular velocity, which is ω = v/r. If r increases, then ω would decrease because v is constant. Alternatively, since ω = qB/m, which is directly proportional to B. Since B decreases, ω decreases. So both conclusions agree. Therefore, the correct answer is B. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA) radius increases, angular velocity increases – no, angular velocity should decrease.\n\nB) radius increases, angular velocity decreases – yes.\n\nC) radius decreases, velocity increases – radius should increase, and velocity remains same.\n\nD) radius decreases, velocity remains – radius increases. So B is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when moving from a stronger to weaker field, the particle's path would bend less, hence larger radius. Angular velocity is lower because the same speed is spread over a larger circle, so the rate of rotation is slower. \n\nI think that's right. So the answer is B.\n</think>"}
