Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that the maximum distance between two points on separate spheres should be related to the distance between the centers of the spheres plus the radii of each sphere. Is that right? Let me visualize it. If you have two spheres, the farthest apart two points can be is when they're on the line connecting the two centers, right? One point as far as possible from the other center in one direction, and the other point as far as possible in the opposite direction. So, adding the distance between centers and the two radii would give the maximum distance. \n\nLet me confirm this. Suppose we have two spheres, one with center C1 and radius r1, and another with center C2 and radius r2. The maximum distance between a point on the first sphere and a point on the second sphere would be the distance between C1 and C2 plus r1 + r2. That seems correct because if you go from one point on the first sphere through the center to the other center and then to a point on the second sphere, the total distance is the distance between centers plus each radius. \n\nSo, then, my job is to first calculate the distance between the centers of these two spheres, and then add the two radii to it. Let me write down the centers:\n\nFirst sphere: Center at (-2, -10, 5), radius 19.\n\nSecond sphere: Center at (12, 8, -16), radius 87.\n\nSo, distance between centers can be found using the distance formula in 3D. The formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2]. Let me compute each component:\n\nFor the x-coordinate difference: 12 - (-2) = 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nFor the y-coordinate difference: 8 - (-10) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nFor the z-coordinate difference: -16 - 5 = -21. The square will take care of the negative.\n\nSo, squaring each of these:\n\n14^2 = 196,\n\n18^2 = 324,\n\n(-21)^2 = 441.\n\nAdding them up: 196 + 324 = 520; 520 + 441 = 961.\n\nThen, sqrt(961) is 31. So the distance between centers is 31 units.\n\nThen, adding the radii: 19 + 87 = 106.\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance between two points on the spheres is 31 + 106 = 137. \n\nWait, let me check if this makes sense. If the spheres were overlapping, would this still be the case? But even if they overlap, the maximum distance between points on each sphere would still be the distance between centers plus the radii. Because even if they overlap, the farthest points would still be on the line connecting the centers but on the outer sides. The overlap would affect the minimum distance, not the maximum. So, yes, regardless of whether they intersect or not, the maximum distance is distance between centers plus radii. \n\nSo, then, in this case, the answer should be 31 + 19 + 87 = 137. \n\nBut let me verify my calculation of the distance between centers again. Let me recalculate the differences:\n\nFrom (-2, -10, 5) to (12, 8, -16):\n\nx: 12 - (-2) = 14, correct.\n\ny: 8 - (-10) = 18, correct.\n\nz: -16 - 5 = -21, correct.\n\nSquares: 14² is 196, 18² is 324, (-21)² is 441. Sum is 196 + 324 + 441. Let me add again:\n\n196 + 324: 196 + 300 = 496, 496 + 24 = 520. Then 520 + 441: 520 + 400 = 920, 920 + 41 = 961. sqrt(961) is indeed 31. Correct. \n\nSo 31 + 19 + 87. Let me compute 19 + 87 first. 19 + 87 is 106. Then 31 + 106 is 137. \n\nSo yes, 137. Therefore, the largest possible distance is 137. \n\nBut let me think again if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using vectors or something else? Let me try.\n\nSuppose we have two points, P on the first sphere and Q on the second sphere. The distance between P and Q is |P - Q|. We need to maximize this. \n\nBut since P is on the first sphere, |P - C1| = r1 = 19, and Q is on the second sphere, |Q - C2| = r2 = 87.\n\nWe can express P as C1 + 19*u, where u is a unit vector, and Q as C2 + 87*v, where v is a unit vector. Then, the distance between P and Q is |C1 - C2 + 19*u - 87*v|. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, P - Q = (C1 + 19*u) - (C2 + 87*v) = (C1 - C2) + 19*u - 87*v. Therefore, the distance is |(C1 - C2) + 19*u - 87*v|. To maximize this, we need to choose u and v such that this vector is as long as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of maximizing |P - Q| = |(P - C1) + (C1 - C2) + (C2 - Q)|. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe using triangle inequality?\n\nLet me recall that |P - Q| ≤ |P - C1| + |C1 - C2| + |C2 - Q| by triangle inequality. But since |P - C1| = r1 and |C2 - Q| = r2, then |P - Q| ≤ r1 + |C1 - C2| + r2. Which is exactly the same as before. And equality occurs when P is in the direction from C1 away from C2, and Q is in the direction from C2 away from C1. Therefore, that maximum is indeed achievable, so the maximum distance is |C1 - C2| + r1 + r2. \n\nTherefore, my previous calculation is correct. Therefore, 31 + 19 + 87 = 137. \n\nWait, just to check if there's a possibility that the maximum occurs in some other direction? For example, if the spheres are in some configuration where... Hmm. But no, because if you think of two spheres, the maximum distance between any two points on them must lie along the line connecting the centers. Because if you have two points not on that line, you could adjust them to be on the line and get a longer distance. \n\nFor example, imagine two spheres in 2D for simplicity. If you have a point on the first sphere at some angle theta from the line connecting the centers, and similarly for the second sphere, then the distance between them would be maximized when both points are aligned with the line connecting the centers, on the opposite ends. Otherwise, the distance would be less due to the cosine law. \n\nTherefore, yes, the maximum distance is indeed the distance between centers plus the two radii. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The largest possible distance is 137. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe largest possible distance is \\boxed{137}.\n</think>"}
