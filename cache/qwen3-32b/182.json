The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, let me recall that aromatic protons typically appear in the range of 6-8 ppm. The problem mentions two singlets at around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Since they are singlets, there's no splitting, which suggests that the aromatic protons are all equivalent. But since there are two separate singlets, each must correspond to a different set of equivalent protons from each compound.\n\nEach compound in the mixture is a tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene. The molecular formula is C10H14. Let's check the formula for each option:\n\nFor tetramethylbenzenes, the base is benzene (C6H5) plus four methyl groups (each CH3 is C1H3). So benzene is C6H5, adding four methyl groups would be 4*C1H3 = 4C + 12H. Total formula would be C6+4=10, H5+12=17? Wait, but the formula given is C10H14. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again. Benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups would replace four H's on benzene with CH3. So original benzene has six H. If you replace four H's with CH3, each substitution would add two H (since CH3 replaces one H with three H). So total H would be (original H - substituted H) + (new H from methyl). Original H is 6. Subtract 4 (because four H are replaced), so 2 left. Then add 4*3 = 12 H from methyl groups. Total H is 2 + 12 = 14. Yes, so the formula is C10H14. So each of these tetramethylbenzenes has that formula. Similarly, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups (C2H5 each) attached to benzene. Benzene is C6H5. Adding two ethyl groups would be 2*C2H5 = 4C + 10H. Total C is 6 + 4 = 10. H is 5 + 10 = 15? Wait, but the formula is C10H14. Wait, maybe similar substitution. Original benzene has six H. If two H are replaced by ethyl groups. Each ethyl group adds 5 H (since replacing one H with C2H5). So original H is 6 - 2 = 4, plus 2*5 = 10. Total H is 4 + 10 = 14. Yes, so 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14.\n\nSo all the options fit the formula.\n\nNow, the NMR data: two aromatic singlets at 6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one set of equivalent aromatic protons. Since they are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integral ratio of the two singlets is 1:1. Let's think about how many aromatic protons each compound has.\n\nFor the tetramethylbenzenes, the number of aromatic protons depends on their substitution pattern. Let me consider each isomer:\n\n1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (pseudoparacyclophane or something? Let me draw it mentally. Benzene with methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), then position 4 and 5 are adjacent. The ring would have methyl groups on 1,2,4,5. So the remaining positions are 3 and 6. Are there any H there? Let me see. Benzene has six positions. If four are substituted, there are two positions left. Let me check substitution.\n\nIn 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the positions are 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are unsubstituted. But wait, in a benzene ring, substituents can be in different positions. Let me visualize:\n\nPositions 1,2,4,5. Let's number the benzene ring 1-2-3-4-5-6-1. So substituents at 1,2,4,5. Then the remaining positions are 3 and 6. Are the H at 3 and 6 equivalent? Let me see. If there are substituents at 1,2,4,5, then positions 3 and 6 are across the ring. Depending on the symmetry, maybe they are equivalent. Let me think. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center, perhaps. For example, if you have substituents at 1 and 5, and 2 and 4, then the ring is symmetric. So positions 3 and 6 would be equivalent? Wait, position 3 is opposite to position 6? No, in a benzene ring, position 3 is opposite to position 6? Let me see. In a hexagon, opposite positions are 1-4, 2-5, 3-6. So yes, 3 and 6 are opposite. If the molecule has substituents at 1,2,4,5, then positions 3 and 6 are each adjacent to different substituents. Wait, position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Both 2 and 4 have methyl groups. Similarly, position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. Both 5 and 1 have methyl groups. So the environment of positions 3 and 6 are similar. So the H at 3 and 6 would be equivalent. Therefore, there are two aromatic protons? No, each position has one H. Wait, each carbon in the ring has one H. If positions 3 and 6 have H, then there are two Hs. But they are equivalent? If the molecule is symmetric, then yes. So the aromatic protons would be two equivalent Hs. Therefore, the aromatic region would have a singlet with two protons. But the problem says there are two singlets in the aromatic region. So if this compound is present, it would contribute one singlet. Let's note that.\n\n2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Let me see the remaining positions. Positions 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me check. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So positions 4 and 6 each have adjacent methyl groups. Are they equivalent? If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps. Let me imagine the structure. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then the ring would have a methyl group at 1,2,3, and 5. So positions 4 and 6. Position 4 is between 3 and 5 (both methyls). Position 6 is between 5 and 1 (both methyls). So positions 4 and 6 would be equivalent if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you rotate the ring 180 degrees, maybe positions 4 and 6 swap. Therefore, they are equivalent. So there are two aromatic protons (positions 4 and 6), equivalent. So another singlet with two protons.\n\n3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. Remaining positions are 5 and 6. Let me check. Positions 5 and 6. Each adjacent to 4 and 5? Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6. Position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1 (methyl). So positions 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? If the molecule has substituents at 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6. Let me think about symmetry. If you have four methyl groups in a row on the ring, the molecule would have a symmetry plane through the middle. So positions 5 and 6 would be equivalent. So again, two aromatic protons, equivalent. So another singlet with two protons.\n\n4. 1,4-diethylbenzene: two ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4 (para). The benzene ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Let me check the aromatic protons. Since the ethyl groups are para, the ring would have symmetry. The Hs at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent (each adjacent to ethyl at 1 and para ethyl at 4?), and Hs at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So there are two sets of aromatic protons: two Hs each. So two singlets? Wait, but in reality, in para-disubstituted benzene, the Hs adjacent to substituents (ortho) are equivalent, and the meta Hs are equivalent. So in 1,4-diethylbenzene, there are two sets of aromatic protons: two Hs (ortho) and two Hs (meta). Wait, but each set would be two protons. So in the aromatic region, two singlets, each with two protons? But the problem says there are two singlets in the aromatic region. So if 1,4-diethylbenzene is present, it would contribute two singlets. However, the problem states that the mixture gives two singlets in the aromatic region. But if the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds, each contributing one singlet, then total two singlets. So if one of the compounds is 1,4-diethylbenzene, which contributes two singlets, then the total would be three singlets in the aromatic region. But the problem says only two singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the two compounds in the mixture. Because if it's present, it would contribute two singlets, and the other compound would contribute one, making three total. But the problem says two singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not part of the mixture. So options C and D are out? Wait, option C is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. If 1,4-diethylbenzene is excluded, then option C is out. Similarly, option D is 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4, which are both tetramethylbenzenes. So if both contribute one singlet each, total two. So that's possible. But let me check.\n\nSo the options are A, B, C, D. Since C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would add two singlets, making three total, which is inconsistent. Therefore, C is out. So possible options are A, B, D.\n\nNow, the aromatic region has two singlets. Each compound in the mixture contributes one singlet. So each compound has one set of aromatic protons. Which of the tetramethylbenzenes have only one set of aromatic protons?\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two aromatic protons (positions 3 and 6), equivalent. So one singlet with two protons.\n\nFor 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: two aromatic protons (positions 4 and 6), equivalent. So one singlet with two protons.\n\nFor 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: two aromatic protons (positions 5 and 6), equivalent. So one singlet with two protons.\n\nSo all three tetramethylbenzenes (excluding the diethyl) would each contribute one singlet. Therefore, if the mixture is any two of them, the aromatic region would have two singlets. But the problem says the two singlets are in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integral ratio of the two singlets would be equal if each compound has the same number of aromatic protons. Since each of these compounds has two aromatic protons, then each singlet would integrate for two protons. So in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integrals would be 2:2, which is 1:1. So that matches the given data.\n\nTherefore, the aromatic part is consistent with any two of the three tetramethylbenzenes. So the answer must be among options A, B, D.\n\nNow, moving to the other part of the NMR spectrum: three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. These are likely the methyl or methylene groups. Let's analyze each compound's expected NMR signals in the aliphatic region.\n\nFirst, let's consider each tetramethylbenzene:\n\n1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: four methyl groups. Are they equivalent? Let me check. The structure is 1,2,4,5. The methyl groups at positions 1 and 5 are para to each other? No, positions 1 and 5 are two positions apart. Let me visualize. In a benzene ring, positions 1,2,4,5. So the methyl groups are on adjacent positions (1-2 and 4-5). The molecule has a symmetry. Let me see: if you rotate the ring 180 degrees, position 1 swaps with 5, and 2 swaps with 4. So the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, as are those at 2 and 4. Therefore, there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: two methyl groups (each with two methyl groups). Wait, each position has one methyl group. So total four methyl groups. If there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each set would have two methyl groups. For example, methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent (due to symmetry), and methyl groups at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Each set has two methyl groups. Each methyl group has three protons. So for each set, the total protons would be 2 methyl groups * 3 H = 6 H. But since they are equivalent, each set would give one singlet. However, the problem states three signals in the aliphatic region. So this compound would only give two singlets in the aliphatic region. But the mixture has three signals. Therefore, if this compound is present, it would contribute two singlets. So if the other compound also contributes one or more signals, the total might be three. Let's check the other compounds.\n\n2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: four methyl groups. Let's check their equivalence. The substituents are at positions 1,2,3,5. Let me see the symmetry. If you rotate the ring, maybe there's a plane. Let's see: positions 1,2,3,5. The opposite of 1 is 4, of 2 is 5, of 3 is 6. Since there are methyls at 1,2,3,5. So position 5 is opposite to position 2. So maybe there is a symmetry where positions 1 and 3 are equivalent? Or perhaps not. Let me try to see. If you have methyls at 1,2,3,5, the molecule may not have a high symmetry. Let me think. The substituents are in a row at 1,2,3, then a methyl at 5. So positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, and 5 is separated. So the methyl groups at 1, 2, 3 are in a meta position relative to each other? Maybe the methyl groups are not all equivalent. Let me consider:\n\n- Methyl at position 1: adjacent to 6 and 2 (both have methyls at 2). Wait, position 1 is adjacent to 6 and 2. Position 2 has a methyl. Position 6 is unsubstituted.\n\n- Methyl at position 2: adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at position 3: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (unsubstituted).\n\n- Methyl at position 5: adjacent to 4 (unsubstituted) and 6 (unsubstituted? Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Position 4 is unsubstituted, position 6 is unsubstituted.\n\nSo the methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 have different environments. Let me check for equivalence:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to a methyl (position 2) and a hydrogen (position 6).\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to two methyls (positions 1 and 3).\n\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to a methyl (position 2) and a hydrogen (position 4).\n\n- Methyl at 5: adjacent to two hydrogens (positions 4 and 6).\n\nSo the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are in similar environments but not identical. Wait, position 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6. Position 3 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 4. If the molecule has a symmetry that swaps positions 1 and 3, then maybe they are equivalent. Let me see: if there's a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, maybe. For example, if you have substituents at 1,2,3,5, then a plane going through the middle between positions 2 and 5? Not sure. Alternatively, if you rotate the ring 180 degrees, maybe. Let me imagine rotating the ring so that position 1 goes to position 5, position 2 to position 4, etc. But position 5 has a methyl, position 4 doesn't. So that rotation wouldn't preserve the structure. Therefore, positions 1 and 3 are not equivalent. Similarly, the methyl at position 5 is unique. Therefore, in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the four methyl groups are in three different environments:\n\n- Methyl at position 2 (adjacent to two methyls): unique environment.\n\n- Methyl at position 1 and 3 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H): maybe equivalent if there's some symmetry. Wait, if there's a plane that swaps positions 1 and 3, then they would be equivalent. Let me consider: if the molecule has a substituent at position 2 and 5, and positions 1 and 3 are symmetric with respect to the axis through 2 and 5. Maybe. Let me imagine the ring with substituents at 1,2,3,5. If you have a plane of symmetry that goes through position 2 and the center of the ring between positions 5 and 6, then positions 1 and 3 might be mirrored. In that case, the methyl groups at 1 and 3 would be equivalent. The methyl at position 5 is unique. The methyl at position 2 is unique. Therefore, there would be three sets of methyl groups:\n\n- Methyl at position 2: one set (2 methyl groups? No, position 2 has one methyl group. Wait, each position has one methyl group. So if the methyl at 2 is unique, and methyls at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and methyl at 5 is unique, then there are three sets: one with 2 methyl groups (positions 1 and 3), one with 1 methyl (position 2), and one with 1 methyl (position 5). But each methyl group is three protons. So the NMR would have three singlets:\n\n- For positions 1 and 3: 2 methyl groups * 3 H = 6 H.\n\n- For position 2: 1 methyl group * 3 H = 3 H.\n\n- For position 5: 1 methyl group * 3 H = 3 H.\n\nBut the problem states three signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The integrals would be 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1. That matches the given data. So 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would contribute three singlets in the aliphatic region with ratio 2:1:1. So that's good.\n\nNow, the other compound in the mixture must contribute something in the aliphatic region. Let's check the other options.\n\nOption A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAs discussed earlier, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two sets of methyl groups. Let me re-examine that. The structure has methyls at 1,2,4,5. Due to symmetry (180-degree rotation), methyls at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and methyls at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, two sets: two methyl groups each. So each set has 2 methyl groups * 3 H = 6 H. So two singlets, each with 6 H. But the problem states that in the mixture, there are three signals in the aliphatic region. If one compound contributes two signals and the other contributes three, then total signals would be five? Wait, no. Wait, the mixture is 1:1 molar ratio. So each compound's signals would be present. But if one compound has two singlets and the other has three, the total would be five. But the problem says three signals. Therefore, this is a problem. Wait, the problem says three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. So only three signals. So if one compound contributes two singlets and the other contributes three, then overlapping? Or maybe some signals overlap? But the question states three signals, so the total number must be three. Therefore, this suggests that the two compounds in the mixture must have their aliphatic signals overlapping such that they sum to three signals. Let's think.\n\nIf one compound has two singlets (say, 6H and 6H) and the other has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H), then when mixed 1:1, the total would be:\n\n- 6H (from first compound) + 6H (from second compound's 6H?) No, the first compound's two singlets are each 6H. The second compound's three singlets are 6H, 3H, 3H. So the total would be:\n\n- First compound's two singlets: 6H and 6H.\n\n- Second compound's three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H.\n\nBut if the first compound's two singlets are at the same chemical shift as the second compound's 6H singlet? No, because different compounds would have different chemical shifts for their methyl groups. Unless they are in the same environment, which is unlikely. Therefore, the total would be five signals. Which contradicts the given data of three signals. Therefore, option A is not possible.\n\nOption B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nLet me analyze 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. The substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4. Let's check the equivalence of methyl groups. The molecule has a symmetry. If you rotate the ring 180 degrees, positions 1 swaps with 4, and 2 swaps with 3. So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. Therefore, two sets of methyl groups: two methyl groups each. Each set contributes 2 methyl groups * 3 H = 6 H. So two singlets in the aliphatic region. If this compound is mixed with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (which has three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H), then total aliphatic signals would be two (from first compound) plus three (from second), totaling five. Again, not matching the three signals. Therefore, option B is also not possible.\n\nOption D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Both have two singlets in the aliphatic region. So total four signals. Doesn't match. Therefore, none of A, B, D? Wait, but earlier we thought that 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives three aliphatic signals. So if the mixture contains that compound and another which also gives three aliphatic signals, then total would be six? No, but the problem says three. Therefore, the only way to get three signals is if one compound contributes one signal and the other contributes two, but overlapping? Or maybe one compound has three signals and the other has zero? But all compounds have methyl groups. Wait, no. All compounds in the options have methyl or ethyl groups. So all have aliphatic signals. So how can we get three total signals?\n\nWait, let's go back. The problem says there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. The three signals must come from the two compounds in the mixture. Therefore, the two compounds must have their aliphatic signals overlapping such that they sum to three signals. Let me think again about 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene (option C). Earlier I thought that 1,4-diethylbenzene would contribute two aromatic signals, but if the problem says only two aromatic signals, then that would be a problem. However, let me re-examine 1,4-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons.\n\nIn 1,4-diethylbenzene (para-diethylbenzene), the aromatic protons are in two sets: ortho and meta. The ortho protons are at positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to ethyl groups), and meta protons are at positions 3 and 5. Each set has two protons. Therefore, two singlets in the aromatic region. If this compound is in the mixture with another compound that also has two aromatic protons (a tetramethylbenzene), then the total aromatic signals would be two (from first compound) plus two (from second), totaling four. But the problem says two. Therefore, this is inconsistent. However, if one of the compounds has two aromatic protons and the other has zero? No, because all compounds have aromatic protons. So option C is out.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the aromatic signals. The problem says two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. If the mixture is two compounds, each contributing one singlet, then total two. So each compound must have one set of aromatic protons. Therefore, each compound must have aromatic protons that are all equivalent. For the tetramethylbenzenes, we saw that each has two equivalent aromatic protons (positions 3 and 6, etc.), so one singlet. For 1,4-diethylbenzene, two sets of aromatic protons (ortho and meta), each with two protons. Therefore, two singlets. Therefore, if 1,4-diethylbenzene is in the mixture, it would contribute two aromatic singlets, making the total four if mixed with another tetramethylbenzene. But the problem says only two. So 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be part of the mixture. Therefore, options C is out.\n\nSo the correct answer must be among A, B, D. But earlier analysis suggested that mixing any two tetramethylbenzenes would give two aromatic singlets but more than three aliphatic signals. However, the problem states three aliphatic signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. The only compound that gives three aliphatic signals is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Therefore, one of the compounds must be this one. The other compound must contribute no additional signals, but that's impossible because all compounds have methyl groups. Wait, unless the other compound has its aliphatic signals overlapping with those of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. For example, if the other compound has aliphatic signals that are at the same chemical shifts as some of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, thus combining their integrals.\n\nLet me consider option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. As discussed, 1,2,4,5 has two aliphatic singlets (6H and 6H), and 1,2,3,5 has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). If their chemical shifts overlap, maybe the 6H from 1,2,4,5 and the 6H from 1,2,3,5 are at the same ppm. Let's assume that. Then, in the mixture, the 6H from both compounds would add up to 6H + 6H = 12H, but the problem says the total aliphatic signals are three with ratio 2:1:1. If the two 6H signals are at the same shift, they would combine into one signal with 12H. Then the other signals from 1,2,3,5 would be 3H and 3H. So total three signals: 12H, 3H, 3H. The ratio would be 12:3:3 = 4:1:1, which doesn't match the required 2:1:1. Therefore, not matching.\n\nOption B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. 1,2,3,4 has two aliphatic singlets (6H each), and 1,2,3,5 has three (6H, 3H, 3H). If the 6H from 1,2,3,4 and the 6H from 1,2,3,5 are at the same ppm, then combined 12H. Then the other signals are 3H and 3H. Again, ratio 4:1:1, not matching.\n\nOption D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4. Both have two aliphatic singlets (each 6H). If they are at the same ppm, then total would be 12H, one signal. But the problem requires three signals. So no.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. What if one of the compounds has three aliphatic signals and the other has one? But all the tetramethylbenzenes have either two or three aliphatic signals. The only one with three is 1,2,3,5. So if the other compound has one aliphatic signal, but none of the tetramethylbenzenes have that. Wait, no. All have two or three. Unless... Wait, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the methyl group equivalence for some compounds.\n\nLet me re-examine 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Structure: methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. Symmetry: rotating 180 degrees swaps 1 with 4 and 2 with 3. So methyls at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So two sets of two methyl groups each. Each set has 6H. So two singlets. So no.\n\nWhat about 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene? Two sets of two methyl groups each. Two singlets. So no.\n\nSo the only one with three aliphatic signals is 1,2,3,5. Therefore, to get three total signals, the other compound must have its aliphatic signals overlapping with some of the signals from 1,2,3,5. For example, if the other compound has two aliphatic signals, one of which overlaps with the 6H signal of 1,2,3,5, and the other overlaps with either the 3H signals. Let's try.\n\nTake option A: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5. The 1,2,4,5 has two aliphatic signals: let's say 6H and 6H. If the 6H from 1,2,4,5 overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, then combined integral is 6 + 6 = 12H. The remaining signals from 1,2,3,5 are 3H and 3H. But the problem requires three signals with ratio 2:1:1. If the total integrals are 12H, 3H, 3H, the ratio is 4:1:1, not 2:1:1. Not matching.\n\nWhat if the other compound has one of its signals overlapping with one of the 3H signals? Let's say one of the 6H signals from the other compound overlaps with one 3H signal. But this is getting too vague. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, the problem states that the three aliphatic signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is important. Each compound has four methyl groups (each with 3H), so total 12H per compound. Since the mixture is 1:1, total aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. The integral ratio is 2:1:1, which sums to 4 parts. So the parts would correspond to 24H / 4 = 6H per part. Therefore:\n\n- The 2 part would be 12H.\n\n- The 1 part would be 6H each.\n\nSo the three signals have integrals of 12H, 6H, 6H. But the problem states 2:1:1, which would be 12:6:6, simplifying to 2:1:1. That matches.\n\nNow, if one compound contributes 12H and the other contributes 6H and 6H, then total would be three signals: 12H, 6H, 6H. This would happen if one compound has all its methyl groups in one set (12H), and the other has two sets of 6H each. Is there a compound with all methyl groups equivalent?\n\nWait, no. All the tetramethylbenzenes have either two or three sets. The only way to have all methyl groups equivalent is if the compound is symmetric enough. For example, if the four methyl groups are all equivalent. But in tetramethylbenzene, that's only possible if they are in a symmetrical arrangement. For example, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene doesn't have all methyl groups equivalent. The only possibility is if the compound is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has two sets of two methyl groups each. Not all equivalent. Similarly for others. Therefore, no compound has all methyl groups equivalent. Therefore, the only way to get a 12H signal is if two sets of 6H from two different compounds overlap. For example, if two compounds each have a 6H signal at the same chemical shift. Let's see.\n\nIf the mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (two 6H signals) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (two 6H signals), then if all four 6H signals overlap into one, the total would be 24H, which is one signal. But the problem requires three signals. Not matching.\n\nIf the mixture is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (6H, 3H, 3H) and another compound that has one 6H and one 6H, and if the 6H from both compounds overlap, then total 12H, plus the 3H and 3H from the first compound. This gives three signals: 12H, 3H, 3H. As before, ratio 4:1:1. Not matching.\n\nWait, but if the other compound has one 6H signal and one 6H signal, and one of those overlaps with the 3H signal from the first compound. For example, if one 6H signal from the other compound overlaps with one 3H signal from the first compound, and the other 6H signal is separate. But this is too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other compound is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's check its aliphatic signals. 1,4-diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups. Each ethyl group has a methyl (CH3) and a methylene (CH2). In the NMR, the ethyl groups would give two sets of signals: the methyl group (CH3) and the methylene group (CH2). However, due to the symmetry of para-substitution, the two ethyl groups are equivalent. Therefore, each ethyl group's CH3 and CH2 would be equivalent. So for each ethyl group, the CH3 would give a triplet (due to coupling with CH2), but since the problem states all are singlets, this suggests that there is no coupling, meaning the ethyl groups are in a symmetric environment where the protons are equivalent. Wait, but in reality, in para-diethylbenzene, the ethyl groups are equivalent, so each ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to the aromatic ring and the CH3 is adjacent to the CH2. However, the protons on the CH2 would be split by the CH3, but if the ethyl groups are in a symmetric environment, maybe the coupling is averaged out or the protons are equivalent. However, typically, in ethyl groups, the CH3 is a triplet and the CH2 is a quartet. But if the ethyl groups are in a symmetric environment (like in para-disubstituted benzene), the protons might be equivalent. For example, if the two ethyl groups are para, then the protons on the CH2 groups might be equivalent, and the protons on the CH3 groups might also be equivalent. Therefore, in the NMR, you would see two singlets: one for the CH3 (three protons) and one for the CH2 (two protons). But the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. So if 1,4-diethylbenzene is present, it would contribute two singlets: one for the CH3 (3H) and one for the CH2 (2H). \n\nNow, if the mixture is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (with three aliphatic signals: 6H, 3H, 3H) and 1,4-diethylbenzene (with two aliphatic signals: 3H and 2H), then the total aliphatic signals would be:\n\nFrom 1,2,3,5: 6H, 3H, 3H.\n\nFrom 1,4-diethyl: 3H, 2H.\n\nTotal signals: 6H, 3H, 3H, 3H, 2H. But some might overlap. For example, if the 3H from 1,2,3,5 overlaps with the 3H from 1,4-diethyl, then combined 3H + 3H = 6H. Similarly, if the 3H from 1,2,3,5 overlaps with the 2H from 1,4-diethyl, not likely. Let's assume the 3H from 1,2,3,5 overlaps with the 3H from 1,4-diethyl. Then the signals would be:\n\n6H (from 1,2,3,5), 6H (combined 3H + 3H), and 2H (from 1,4-diethyl). But the problem states three signals with 2:1:1. This doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the 2H from 1,4-diethyl overlaps with one of the 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving a combined 5H, which is unlikely. This seems too messy. Also, the aromatic signals would be three (from 1,2,3,5) plus two (from 1,4-diethyl), totaling five, which contradicts the two aromatic signals stated. Therefore, this is not possible.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two aromatic signals, but if the problem states only two aromatic signals, then the other compound must have none, which it can't. So this is not possible.\n\nBack to the drawing board. The only way to get three aliphatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio is if one compound has three signals (1,2,3,5) and the other has none, which is impossible. Or if the other compound has its signals overlapping such that the total is three. Let me think about the chemical shifts. The methyl groups in different environments have different chemical shifts. For example, methyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings are typically around 2.2-2.5 ppm. If two compounds have methyl groups in similar environments, their signals might overlap.\n\nLet's consider option A: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5. The 1,2,4,5 has two methyl sets: let's say both at around 2.2 ppm (since they are all adjacent to aromatic rings). If their chemical shifts are the same, then the two 6H signals from 1,2,4,5 would combine to 12H. The 1,2,3,5 has three signals: 6H, 3H, 3H. If the 6H from 1,2,3,5 is at the same ppm as the combined 12H from 1,2,4,5, then total would be 18H, but the problem states three signals. This seems unlikely. Alternatively, if the 6H from 1,2,3,5 overlaps with one of the 6H from 1,2,4,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H from 1,2,4,5 remains, then we have 12H, 6H, and the 3H, 3H from 1,2,3,5. Total four signals. No.\n\nWait, the problem says three signals at around 2.2 ppm. If all the methyl groups are in similar environments, maybe they all appear at the same ppm. But that's only possible if all methyl groups are equivalent, which isn't the case. However, if the two compounds have methyl groups in the same environment, their signals would overlap. For example, if both compounds have methyl groups adjacent to similar aromatic environments, their chemical shifts might be similar.\n\nLet me think about the chemical shifts for the different methyl groups. In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are adjacent to aromatic rings with varying degrees of substitution. For example, the methyl at position 1 is adjacent to a methyl at position 2 and a hydrogen at position 6. The methyl at position 2 is adjacent to methyls at 1 and 3. The methyl at position 4 is adjacent to methyls at 3 and 5. The methyl at position 5 is adjacent to methyl at 4 and hydrogen at 6. Due to symmetry, the methyls at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. The chemical shift for these methyl groups might depend on their neighboring groups. Methyls adjacent to more methyl groups might be more deshielded (higher ppm), while those adjacent to hydrogens might be more shielded (lower ppm). However, since all are adjacent to the aromatic ring, the chemical shifts might be in the same region, around 2.2 ppm. If the two sets of methyls in 1,2,4,5 have slightly different shifts, but the problem says all signals are around 2.2 ppm, maybe they are close enough to be considered one signal. But the problem states three signals, so this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that the only compound that gives three aliphatic signals with the correct ratio is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and the other compound must contribute no additional signals, which is impossible, perhaps there's an error in my analysis. Let me revisit the aliphatic signals for the other compounds.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let me re-examine it. The structure has methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Due to symmetry, methyls at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. Each set has two methyl groups, so two singlets, each with 6H. If this compound is mixed with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H), and if one of the 6H signals from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with one of the 3H signals, then the total would be:\n\n- Overlapping 6H + 6H = 12H.\n\n- Remaining 3H and 3H.\n\nBut this is speculative. Alternatively, if the 6H from 1,2,3,4 and the 6H from 1,2,3,5 are at the same ppm, and the 3H and 3H from 1,2,3,5 are at another ppm, then total signals would be two: 12H and 6H. But the problem requires three signals. Not matching.\n\nWait, the problem says three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total integral is 2+1+1=4. If each part is 6H (as calculated earlier), then the signals are 12H, 6H, 6H. To achieve this, one compound must contribute 12H and the other must contribute 6H and 6H. But how?\n\nIf one compound has all its methyl groups in one set (12H), and the other has two sets of 6H each. But no compound has all methyl groups equivalent. However, if the other compound has two sets of 6H each at the same ppm as the 12H from the first compound, then they would combine. But this is not possible unless both compounds have all methyl groups equivalent, which they don't.\n\nWait, what if the other compound is 1,4-diethylbenzene? Let's see. 1,4-diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups. Each ethyl group has a methyl (3H) and a methylene (2H). If the methyl groups (3H) from both ethyl groups are equivalent, and the methylene groups (2H) are equivalent. So two singlets: 6H (two methyl groups) and 4H (two methylene groups). But the problem states signals at around 2.2 ppm, which is where methyl groups typically appear. Methylene groups adjacent to aromatic rings usually appear at slightly higher ppm, but maybe in this case, they are also around 2.2. If both the methyl and methylene are at 2.2, then one signal with 10H. But this is unlikely. Typically, methyl groups are more shielded (lower ppm) than methylene groups. But if the problem states all are around 2.2, maybe they are close enough. If 1,4-diethylbenzene contributes one signal with 6H (methyls) and another with 4H (methylene), and the 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes 6H, 3H, 3H, and if the 6H from both compounds overlap, then total signals would be 12H (from 6+6), 3H, 3H, and 4H. This is four signals, not three.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me try to think differently. The key is that the correct answer must be the one where the two compounds in the mixture, when combined, have three aliphatic signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. The only compound that can provide this is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Therefore, one of the compounds must be this one. The other compound must have its aliphatic signals such that when combined, the total is three signals. Let's assume the other compound has one aliphatic signal that overlaps with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5, and the other signals remain.\n\nFor example, if the other compound has a 6H signal that overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, then the total would be 12H, and the remaining signals are 3H and 3H. This gives three signals with ratio 12:3:3 = 4:1:1, which doesn't match. But the problem requires 2:1:1. If instead, the other compound has a 3H signal that overlaps with one of the 3H from 1,2,3,5, then the total would be 6H (from 1,2,3,5's 6H), 6H (from the other compound's signal), and 3H (remaining from 1,2,3,5). This gives 6:6:3 = 2:2:1, not matching.\n\nWait, what if the other compound has a 6H signal and a 6H signal, and one of them overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, and the other overlaps with one of the 3H signals? For example, if one 6H overlaps with 6H, and the other 6H overlaps with 3H, giving 12H and 9H. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the other compound is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which has two 6H signals. If one of these overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with one of the 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving 9H, and the remaining 3H from 1,2,3,5. This would give signals of 12H, 9H, 3H. Ratio 4:3:1, not matching.\n\nThis is very challenging. Let me recall the options again:\n\nA: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5\n\nB: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5\n\nC: 1,2,3,5 and 1,4-diethyl (invalid due to aromatic signals)\n\nD: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4\n\nThe only way to get three aliphatic signals is if one compound is 1,2,3,5 (with three signals) and the other has its signals overlapping with some of them. Let's assume that the other compound has two signals, one of which overlaps with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5, and the other is new. For example, if the other compound has two signals: 6H and 6H. If one 6H overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H is separate, then total signals would be 12H, 6H, and the remaining 3H and 3H from 1,2,3,5. This is four signals, which is too many. But the problem says three.\n\nWait, what if the other compound has one signal that overlaps with one of the 3H signals from 1,2,3,5, and another signal that overlaps with another 3H? For example, if the other compound has two 6H signals, and one of them overlaps with both 3H signals from 1,2,3,5. This is not possible unless the chemical shifts are the same, which is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other compound has one signal at 2.2 ppm that is 2H, and another that is 1H, but this doesn't fit the 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess. The only compound that gives the correct aliphatic ratio is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The other compound must be one that has its aliphatic signals overlapping such that the total is three. The only option that includes 1,2,3,5 is A, B, and C. C is out. Between A and B, let's assume that in option A, the 1,2,4,5 has two 6H signals, and one of them overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H from 1,2,4,5 overlaps with one of the 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving 9H, and the remaining 3H from 1,2,3,5. This would give signals of 12H, 9H, 3H, which doesn't fit. But if the other 6H from 1,2,4,5 is at a different ppm, then we have 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H, which is four signals.\n\nAlternatively, if the two 6H signals from 1,2,4,5 are at the same ppm as the 6H and 3H from 1,2,3,5, but this is too speculative.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is B: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5. Let's see. 1,2,3,4 has two 6H signals. If one overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with one of the 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving 9H, and the remaining 3H from 1,2,3,5. Again, four signals.\n\nWait, what if the two 6H signals from 1,2,3,4 are at the same ppm as the 6H and 3H from 1,2,3,5? For example, if one 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5 (total 12H), and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with one 3H from 1,2,3,5 (total 9H), and the remaining 3H from 1,2,3,5. This gives three signals: 12H, 9H, 3H. Not matching 2:1:1.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to think of the answer choices. The correct answer must be B or D, since A and C have issues. Wait, let me think about the aliphatic signals again for option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4. Both have two 6H signals. If all four 6H signals overlap, giving 24H, one signal. But the problem requires three. No.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is B: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5. Let's calculate the total aliphatic protons. Each compound has 12H. Total 24H. The required ratio is 2:1:1, which is 2+1+1=4 parts. 24H / 4 = 6H per part. So the signals should be 12H, 6H, 6H. How can this happen?\n\nIf one compound contributes 12H (all its methyl groups in one set) and the other contributes 6H and 6H. But no compound has all methyl groups in one set. However, if the two compounds' signals overlap such that:\n\n- From 1,2,3,5: 6H, 3H, 3H.\n\n- From 1,2,3,4: 6H, 6H.\n\nIf the 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with one of the 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving 9H, and the remaining 3H from 1,2,3,5. This gives 12H, 9H, 3H, which doesn't fit. But if the 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving 9H, and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the other 3H, giving another 9H, and the 6H from 1,2,3,5 remains. This gives 6H, 9H, 9H, which is three signals with ratio 2:3:3, not matching.\n\nI think I'm missing something. Let me go back to the aliphatic signals for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has three signals: 6H, 3H, 3H. If the other compound has one signal that is 6H and another that is 6H, and one of those 6H overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H from the other compound is at a different ppm, then the total signals would be 12H, 6H, and the 3H, 3H from 1,2,3,5. This is four signals, but if the 6H from the other compound overlaps with one of the 3H signals, giving 9H, and the other 3H remains, then it's three signals: 12H, 9H, 3H. This doesn't match the required 2:1:1. But if the 6H from the other compound is split into two parts, it's not possible.\n\nWait, what if the other compound is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which has two 6H signals. If one of those 6H signals overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with one of the 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving 9H, and the remaining 3H from 1,2,3,5 is 3H. The ratio would be 12:9:3 = 4:3:1, not matching. But if the 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving 9H, and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the other 3H, giving another 9H, and the 6H from 1,2,3,5 remains. Then the signals are 6H, 9H, 9H, which is 2:3:3, not matching.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Given that the only compound that can give the correct aliphatic ratio is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and the other compound must be one that, when combined, gives three signals, I'll have to go with option B: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5. Even though the signals don't perfectly match, it's the only option that includes 1,2,3,5. Alternatively, the correct answer might be A, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think about the number of signals. If the mixture is 1,2,3,5 (three signals) and another compound with two signals, but one of the signals overlaps, making it three total. For example, if the other compound has two signals, one of which overlaps with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5, then total is 3 + 2 - 1 = 4. No. If two signals overlap, then 3 + 2 - 2 = 3. This would happen if two signals from the other compound overlap with two signals from 1,2,3,5. For example, if the other compound has two 6H signals, and they overlap with the 6H and one of the 3H from 1,2,3,5. This would give:\n\n- 6H (from other compound) + 6H (from 1,2,3,5) = 12H.\n\n- 6H (from other compound) + 3H (from 1,2,3,5) = 9H.\n\n- Remaining 3H from 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut this is three signals: 12H, 9H, 3H. Ratio 4:3:1, not matching. If the other compound has one 6H and one 6H, and they overlap with the 6H and 3H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H and 9H, and the remaining 3H, it's still not matching.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a better approach, I'll conclude that the correct answer is B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Even though the aliphatic signals don't perfectly match, it's the only option that includes 1,2,3,5, which is necessary for the 2:1:1 ratio. Alternatively, the correct answer might be A, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me check one last thing: the total number of aliphatic protons.\n\nFor option B: 1,2,3,4 (12H) and 1,2,3,5 (12H). Total 24H. The required ratio is 2:1:1, which is 4 parts. 24H / 4 = 6H per part. So the signals should be 12H (2 parts), 6H (1 part), 6H (1 part). How can this happen? If the signals are 12H, 6H, 6H. This would require that the two compounds' signals combine to this. For example, if 1,2,3,5 has 6H, 3H, 3H, and 1,2,3,4 has 6H, 6H, and if one of the 6H from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 is at a different ppm, and the 3H, 3H from 1,2,3,5 are at another ppm. This would give three signals: 12H, 6H, 6H (from 3H + 3H). Wait, the 3H + 3H is 6H. Yes! If the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5 overlap, giving 6H, and one of the 6H signals from 1,2,3,4 overlaps with the 6H from 1,2,3,5, giving 12H, and the other 6H from 1,2,3,4 is at a different ppm, then the three signals are 12H, 6H (from the overlapped 3H+3H), and 6H (from the other 6H of 1,2,3,4). This gives three signals with integrals 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This matches the required ratio!\n\nYes! This makes sense. So the three signals are:\n\n- 12H (from 6H + 6H: one from 1,2,3,4 and one from 1,2,3,5).\n\n- 6H (from 3H + 3H: from 1,2,3,5).\n\n- 6H (from the other 6H of 1,2,3,4).\n\nTherefore, the total is three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (12:6:6). This matches the problem's description. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n</think>"}
