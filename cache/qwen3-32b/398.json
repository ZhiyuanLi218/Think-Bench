I need to find the number of turns in the secondary coil of a transformer. The problem says it's an ideal transformer, which probably means I can ignore any losses or inefficiencies and just use the basic transformer equations. \n\nAlright, so the primary voltage is 220 V, and the secondary voltage is 110 V. The primary coil has 800 turns. They want to know how many turns are in the secondary coil. The options are given, but I need to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that transformers work based on electromagnetic induction. The ratio of the voltages in the primary and secondary coils is related to the ratio of the number of turns in each coil. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like V_primary / V_secondary = N_primary / N_secondary. Or maybe it's the other way around? Wait, let me think. If the secondary has more turns than the primary, then the voltage should be stepped up, right? So if the primary has fewer turns, the voltage is lower. So the voltage ratio should equal the turns ratio. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the transformer equation is V_p / V_s = N_p / N_s for an ideal transformer. So that's the primary voltage divided by secondary voltage equals primary turns divided by secondary turns. So if I rearrange this to solve for N_s, the secondary turns, it would be N_s = (V_s / V_p) * N_p. Wait, let me check the algebra again. Starting from V_p / V_s = N_p / N_s, cross-multiplying gives V_p * N_s = V_s * N_p. Then solving for N_s gives N_s = (V_s / V_p) * N_p. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers here: V_p is 220 V, V_s is 110 V, N_p is 800. Therefore N_s equals (110 / 220) multiplied by 800. Simplifying 110 over 220 is 0.5, so 0.5 times 800 is 400. So the secondary coil should have 400 turns. Let me check the options again. Option B is 400. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is there a possibility that I mixed up primary and secondary? Let me think again. If the primary has 800 turns and the voltage is stepping down from 220 to 110, then the secondary should have fewer turns than the primary. Because step-down transformer has fewer turns on the secondary. So 800 turns on primary, secondary should be half, which is 400. Yep, that makes sense. So 400 is indeed the correct answer. So option B. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was remembering the correct ratio. Sometimes I get confused whether it's V1/N1 = V2/N2 or V1/V2 = N1/N2. But in this case, since it's stepping down, the voltage ratio is 2:1, so the turns ratio should also be 2:1, primary to secondary. Therefore, secondary is half of primary, which is 400. Yep, that seems right. \n\nAnother way to think about it is using the formula for turns ratio. The turns ratio (a) is defined as primary turns over secondary turns, which is equal to the voltage ratio (primary voltage over secondary voltage). So a = N_p / N_s = V_p / V_s. Therefore, solving for N_s gives N_s = N_p * (V_s / V_p). Which again is 800 * (110 / 220) = 800 * 0.5 = 400. Yep, same result. \n\nSo I think that's solid. The answer is B, 400 turns. The options given include B as 400, so that's the one to choose. I don't see any issues with this reasoning. It all checks out. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>"}
