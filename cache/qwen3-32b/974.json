The options are A through D, each suggesting a different power of distance. Let me start by recalling what parallax is and how it relates to distance.\n\nParallax is a method used by astronomers to determine the distance to nearby stars. The parallax angle (plx) is measured in arcseconds, and the distance to the star in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax angle. So, if the parallax is plx arcseconds, the distance r is 1/plx parsecs. That's the basic relationship: r = 1/plx. So, plx = 1/r.\n\nNow, the problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. Let's denote the number of stars as N(plx). The problem states N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. But we need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, N(r). \n\nBut wait, when they say \"varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\", does that mean that if you take a range of parallax values, the number of stars in that range is proportional to 1/plx^5? And we need to convert that into a function of distance. So, we need to change variables from plx to r. \n\nSince r = 1/plx, then as distance increases, parallax decreases. So, the number of stars as a function of parallax is N(plx) dplx, and we need to find N(r) dr. \n\nThis is a change of variables problem in calculus. The number of stars in a small range of parallax dplx is N(plx) dplx, and this should be equal to the number of stars in the corresponding distance range dr, which is N(r) dr. Therefore, N(plx) dplx = N(r) dr. \n\nSo, we need to express N(plx) in terms of r and then relate dplx and dr. Let's start by substituting plx = 1/r into N(plx). \n\nGiven N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5, so N(plx) = k / plx^5 for some constant k. \n\nNow, let's find dplx in terms of dr. Since plx = 1/r, taking derivative of both sides with respect to r:\n\nd(plx)/dr = -1/r^2. Therefore, dplx = - (1/r^2) dr. The negative sign indicates that as r increases, plx decreases, which we already know. But since we are dealing with magnitudes, we can take the absolute value. So, dplx = (1/r^2) dr. \n\nWait, actually, when changing variables in integrals, we need to consider the Jacobian determinant, which is the absolute value of the derivative. So, the magnitude of dplx is (1/r^2) dr. Therefore, substituting into the equation N(plx) dplx = N(r) dr:\n\n(k / plx^5) * (1/r^2 dr) = N(r) dr\n\nTherefore, cancelling dr from both sides:\n\nN(r) = k / plx^5 * 1/r^2\n\nBut plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is 1/r^5. Therefore:\n\nN(r) = k / (1/r^5) * 1/r^2 = k * r^5 * 1/r^2 = k * r^3\n\nTherefore, N(r) is proportional to r^3. \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^3. But let me check my steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, N(plx) dplx = N(r) dr.\n\nN(plx) = 1/plx^5. So substituting:\n\n(1/plx^5) dplx = N(r) dr\n\nBut plx = 1/r, so substituting that in:\n\n(1/( (1/r)^5 )) dplx = N(r) dr\n\nWhich is r^5 dplx = N(r) dr\n\nBut dplx = - (1/r^2) dr, so substituting:\n\nr^5 * (-1/r^2 dr) = N(r) dr\n\nTaking absolute values:\n\nr^5 * (1/r^2) dr = N(r) dr\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nr^3 dr = N(r) dr\n\nTherefore, N(r) = r^3. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^3. Therefore, the answer should be A: ~ r^3. \n\nBut wait, I remember that in some cases, the number density of stars might be considered. If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr^2 dr. So if the density is constant, then number of stars per unit distance would be 4πr^2 times density, which is proportional to r^2. But here, the problem is not assuming uniform density. The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So according to the calculation above, it's proportional to r^3. But why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read again. The question says \"how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\" So they want the number of stars as a function of distance, per unit distance. So that's N(r) dr. But according to the calculation, N(r) is proportional to r^3. So the answer is A. \n\nBut if the density was uniform, then the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area times dr, so 4πr^2 dr. Therefore, N(r) dr would be proportional to r^2 dr, meaning N(r) is proportional to r^2. But here, the result is r^3. So why is that?\n\nAh, perhaps because the density of stars is not uniform. The fact that the number of stars as a function of parallax is 1/plx^5 implies that the density increases with distance. Let me think. Let me consider that the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is dN = C / plx^5 dplx, where C is a constant. \n\nBut since plx = 1/r, then dN = C r^5 dplx. But dplx = - dr / r^2. Therefore, dN = C r^5 (-dr / r^2) = -C r^3 dr. So the magnitude is dN = C r^3 dr. Therefore, the number of stars in a distance range dr is proportional to r^3 dr. Therefore, the number per unit distance is proportional to r^3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nBut why is this different from the uniform density case? Because in this case, the density of stars isn't uniform. Let's see. The number of stars in a shell at distance r with thickness dr is dN = ρ(r) * 4πr^2 dr, where ρ(r) is the number density. If dN is proportional to r^3 dr, then ρ(r) * 4πr^2 dr ∝ r^3 dr. Therefore, ρ(r) ∝ r. So the density increases linearly with distance. \n\nSo in this region of the sky, the density of stars increases with distance, which leads to the number of stars per unit distance increasing as r^3. \n\nSo according to this calculation, the answer is A. However, I need to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal relation: dN/dplx ∝ 1/plx^5. So integrating over a range of parallax gives the total number. But we need to express dN in terms of dr. \n\nSince plx = 1/r, then dN/dplx = dN/dr * dr/dplx. Wait, maybe using the chain rule here. \n\nAlternatively, dN = (dN/dplx) * dplx. But dN is also equal to (dN/dr) * dr. Therefore, (dN/dplx) * dplx = (dN/dr) * dr. Therefore, dN/dr = (dN/dplx) * (dplx/dr). \n\nBut given dN/dplx ∝ 1/plx^5, so let's write dN/dplx = k / plx^5. \n\nThen dN/dr = k / plx^5 * (dplx/dr). \n\nAs before, plx = 1/r, so dplx/dr = -1/r^2. \n\nTherefore, dN/dr = k / ( (1/r)^5 ) * (-1/r^2 ) = k * r^5 * (-1/r^2) = -k r^3. \n\nTaking absolute value (since we are interested in magnitude), we get dN/dr ∝ r^3. \n\nSo that confirms it again. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^3. Therefore, the answer is A. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in standard cases, like the number of stars out to a certain distance, you have volume which is r^3, but per unit distance, it's the derivative, which would be 4πr^2 for uniform density. But here, the result is different because the distribution isn't uniform. \n\nSo in conclusion, the answer is A: ~ r^3. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
