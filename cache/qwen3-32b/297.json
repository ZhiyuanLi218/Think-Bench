Hmm, let's see. I remember that balancing chemical equations involves making sure the number of each type of atom is the same on both sides of the equation. Let me start by counting the atoms on each side.\n\nFirst, let's look at the left side (reactants). There's LiOH and H2SO4. Breaking that down:\n\n- LiOH: 1 Li, 1 O, 1 H\n- H2SO4: 2 H, 1 S, 4 O\n\nSo total on the left:\n- Li: 1\n- O: 1 (from LiOH) + 4 (from H2SO4) = 5\n- H: 1 (from LiOH) + 2 (from H2SO4) = 3\n- S: 1\n\nOn the right side (products), we have Li2SO4 and H2O:\n\n- Li2SO4: 2 Li, 1 S, 4 O\n- H2O: 2 H, 1 O\n\nTotal on the right:\n- Li: 2\n- O: 4 (from Li2SO4) + 1 (from H2O) = 5\n- H: 2 (from H2O)\n- S: 1\n\nWait, the sulfur (S) is balanced already, 1 on each side. Oxygen is 5 on both sides? Let me check again. Left side: 1 (from LiOH) + 4 (from H2SO4) = 5. Right side: 4 (from Li2SO4) + 1 (from H2O) = 5. Yes, that's correct. Hydrogen is 3 on the left and 2 on the right. Lithium is 1 on the left and 2 on the right. So the main imbalances are Li and H.\n\nStarting with lithium. There's 1 Li on the left and 2 on the right. To balance Li, maybe I need to put a 2 in front of LiOH. Let's try that:\n\n2 LiOH + H2SO4 → Li2SO4 + H2O\n\nNow let's recount:\n\nLeft side:\n- Li: 2 (from 2 LiOH)\n- O: 2 (from 2 LiOH) + 4 (from H2SO4) = 6\n- H: 2 (from 2 LiOH) + 2 (from H2SO4) = 4\n- S: 1\n\nRight side:\n- Li: 2\n- O: 4 (from Li2SO4) + 1 (from H2O) = 5\n- H: 2 (from H2O)\n- S: 1\n\nNow oxygen is 6 on the left and 5 on the right. Hydrogen is 4 on the left and 2 on the right. So O and H are off now. Let's see. Maybe we need to adjust the H2O coefficient. Let's see, if we put a 2 in front of H2O, that would give 2 H2O, which is 4 H and 2 O. Let's try that:\n\n2 LiOH + H2SO4 → Li2SO4 + 2 H2O\n\nNow check:\n\nLeft side:\n- Li: 2\n- O: 2 (from LiOH) + 4 (from H2SO4) = 6\n- H: 2 (from LiOH) + 2 (from H2SO4) = 4\n- S: 1\n\nRight side:\n- Li: 2\n- O: 4 (from Li2SO4) + 2 (from 2 H2O) = 6\n- H: 4 (from 2 H2O)\n- S: 1\n\nNow everything seems balanced. Let me double-check each element:\n\n- Li: 2 on both sides\n- O: 6 on both sides (left: 2 + 4, right: 4 + 2)\n- H: 4 on both sides (left: 2 + 2, right: 2*2)\n- S: 1 on both sides\n\nYes, that works. So the balanced equation is 2 LiOH + H2SO4 → Li2SO4 + 2 H2O. Let me just make sure there are no common factors that can simplify the coefficients. The coefficients are 2, 1, 1, 2. The greatest common divisor is 1, so this is the simplest form. Alright, that should be correct.\n</think>"}
