The formula for weight is:\n\n$$\nF = G \\cdot \\frac{M \\cdot m}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the weight,\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,\n- $ M $ is the mass of the planet,\n- $ m $ is the mass of the object (the astronaut),\n- $ r $ is the radius of the planet.\n\nThis means that **weight is directly proportional to the mass of the planet** and **inversely proportional to the square of the radius**.\n\n---\n\n### **Given Information**\n\n- The astronaut’s weight on Earth is **800 N**.\n- The new planet has **twice the mass** of Earth: $ M_{\\text{planet}} = 2M_{\\text{Earth}} $.\n- The new planet has **twice the radius** of Earth: $ r_{\\text{planet}} = 2r_{\\text{Earth}} $.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet’s denote the gravitational acceleration on Earth as $ g_{\\text{Earth}} = \\frac{G M_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} $, and on the new planet as:\n\n$$\ng_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{G M_{\\text{planet}}}{r_{\\text{planet}}^2}\n$$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n$$\ng_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{G \\cdot 2M_{\\text{Earth}}}{(2r_{\\text{Earth}})^2} = \\frac{2G M_{\\text{Earth}}}{4r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{G M_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\text{Earth}}\n$$\n\nSo, the gravitational acceleration on the new planet is **half** that of Earth.\n\nSince weight is mass times gravitational acceleration ($ F = m \\cdot g $), and the astronaut's **mass** remains the same, his **weight on the new planet** will also be **half** of what it is on Earth.\n\n$$\nF_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 800\\ \\text{N} = 400\\ \\text{N}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{B: 400\\ \\text{N}}\n$$","think_content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how much the astronaut will weigh on this new planet. Let me start by recalling what I know about gravity and weight. \n\nFirst, weight is the force of gravity acting on an object, right? So the weight of something is calculated by the formula F = G * (M * m) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, m is the mass of the object (the astronaut here), and r is the radius of the planet.\n\nThe problem says that the planet has a mass twice that of Earth and a radius twice that of Earth. The astronaut's weight on Earth is 800 N. I need to find his weight on this new planet.\n\nLet me denote Earth's mass as M_earth and Earth's radius as r_earth. Then the new planet has M_planet = 2*M_earth and r_planet = 2*r_earth.\n\nThe astronaut's weight on Earth is F_earth = G * (M_earth * m) / r_earth² = 800 N.\n\nNow, his weight on the new planet would be F_planet = G * (M_planet * m) / r_planet². Substituting the given values, that becomes G * (2*M_earth * m) / (2*r_earth)².\n\nLet me simplify that denominator first. (2*r_earth) squared is 4*r_earth². So the equation becomes F_planet = G * (2*M_earth * m) / (4*r_earth²). \n\nSimplifying the constants: 2 divided by 4 is 1/2. So that gives F_planet = (1/2) * [G * (M_earth * m) / r_earth²]. \n\nBut wait, that bracketed part is exactly the formula for the astronaut's weight on Earth, which is 800 N. So substituting that in, F_planet = (1/2) * 800 N = 400 N. \n\nSo according to this calculation, the astronaut's weight on the new planet would be 400 N. Let me check if I did that correctly. \n\nOriginal Earth weight: F_earth = G*M_earth*m / r_earth². \n\nNew planet weight: F_planet = G*(2*M_earth)*m / (2*r_earth)². \n\nExpanding denominator: 2²=4, so denominator is 4*r_earth². \n\nSo F_planet = (2/4) * [G*M_earth*m / r_earth²] = (1/2)*F_earth. \n\nYes, that seems right. So half of 800 N is 400 N. Therefore, the answer should be B: 400 N. \n\nWait, let me think again. Sometimes when dealing with ratios, it's easy to mix up the factors. Let me write it as a ratio between F_planet and F_earth. \n\nF_planet / F_earth = (M_planet / M_earth) * (r_earth / r_planet)². \n\nBecause the formula for weight is proportional to mass over radius squared. \n\nSo substituting the given values: M_planet is 2*M_earth, so M_planet/M_earth = 2. \n\nr_planet is 2*r_earth, so (r_earth / r_planet)² = (1/2)² = 1/4. \n\nMultiplying those together: 2 * 1/4 = 1/2. Therefore, F_planet = (1/2)*F_earth = 400 N. \n\nYep, same result. So that's consistent. \n\nAnother way to think about it: gravitational acceleration on the surface of a planet is g = G*M / r². \n\nOn Earth, g_earth = G*M_earth / r_earth². \n\nOn the new planet, g_planet = G*(2*M_earth) / (2*r_earth)² = 2G*M_earth / (4*r_earth²) = (1/2)*(G*M_earth / r_earth²) = (1/2)*g_earth. \n\nSo the gravitational acceleration on the new planet is half that of Earth's. Therefore, the astronaut's weight, which is mass times gravitational acceleration, would also be half. \n\nSince his weight on Earth is 800 N, his weight on the new planet is 800 N / 2 = 400 N. \n\nAll three methods give me the same answer, so I think 400 N is correct. The answer should be option B. \n\nLet me just make sure there isn't any trick in the question. The problem states the astronaut's weight on Earth is 800 N, which is straightforward. The planet's mass and radius are each twice that of Earth. So no hidden factors here. \n\nWait, another check: if the planet had the same radius as Earth but twice the mass, then the gravitational acceleration would be twice as much, making the astronaut's weight 1600 N. But since the radius is doubled, that introduces a factor of 1/4 from the radius, and with the mass doubling, it's 2*(1/4) = 1/2. So yeah, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the radius was the same, doubling mass would double weight. If the mass was the same but radius doubled, the weight would be 1/4. So combining both, doubling mass and doubling radius gives 2*(1/4) = 1/2. \n\nYep, that all checks out. So I'm confident the answer is B: 400 N.\n</think>"}
