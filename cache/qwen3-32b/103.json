So, we have a series of reactions starting with Reactant A, which is C10H9ClO. The first clue is about the DEPT-135 spectrum. DEPT-135 typically shows positive peaks for CH and CH3 groups, and negative peaks for CH2 groups. A single negative peak suggests there's only one CH2 group in Reactant A. \n\nThen Reactant A undergoes an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reaction with a Lewis acid to form Product B. Friedel-Crafts reactions usually involve acylation or alkylation. Since it's intramolecular, the molecule must have a way to form a ring. The fact that Product B also has a single negative DEPT-135 peak means it still has one CH2 group. So maybe the reaction didn't add any new CH2 groups but formed a ring, perhaps converting a side chain into a ring structure.\n\nNext, Product B is treated with hydrazine and NaOH to form Product C. Hydrazine with NaOH is often used in the Wolff-Kishner reduction, which reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. If Product B has a ketone group, this would convert it to a methylene group (CH2), which would change the DEPT-135 spectrum. Product C now has two negative peaks, meaning two CH2 groups. So maybe the reduction added a CH2 group, increasing the number from one to two.\n\nThen Product C is heated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of peroxide to form Product D. NBS in peroxide usually leads to allylic bromination. The 13C-NMR for Product D shows two peaks below 60 ppm and the rest above 100 ppm. Peaks below 60 ppm are typically for CH2 or CH3 groups adjacent to oxygen or other electronegative atoms, or maybe aromatic carbons? Wait, aromatic carbons are usually around 120-150 ppm. So maybe the two peaks below 60 ppm are from CH2 groups attached to bromine or something else. Since NBS adds bromine at allylic positions, which are usually adjacent to double bonds. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: 2,3-dibromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene\nB: 2-bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene\nC: 1-bromo-1,2-dihydronaphthalene\nD: 2-bromonaphthalene\n\nProduct D's 13C NMR has two peaks below 60 ppm. Let's consider each option.\n\nFor D: 2-bromonaphthalene. Naphthalene has aromatic carbons, so their peaks would be above 100 ppm. The bromine is on a carbon that's part of the aromatic ring. But aromatic carbons are not below 60 ppm. So maybe D doesn't have any peaks below 60. So maybe not D.\n\nFor C: 1-bromo-1,2-dihydronaphthalene. The dihydronaphthalene part has a double bond, and the bromine is on the 1 position. The carbon with bromine might have a peak around, say, 30-40 ppm? Maybe. But there's only one bromine, so only one peak below 60? But Product D has two peaks below 60. So C might not be right.\n\nFor B: 2-bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene. The tetrahydronaphthalene is a decalin-like structure? Wait, tetrahydronaphthalene is a naphthalene with four hydrogens added, so maybe a six-membered ring fused with a five-membered? Not sure. The 2-bromo position would be on a carbon that's part of the ring. If the ring has CH2 groups, their carbons might be around 20-30 ppm. But again, only one bromine, so one peak below 60. But Product D has two peaks. So maybe not B.\n\nFor A: 2,3-dibromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene. Two bromines on positions 2 and 3. The tetrahydronaphthalene part would have some CH2 groups. Let's think about the structure. If the molecule has two bromine atoms attached to CH2 groups, their carbons would be deshielded. For example, allylic bromines would cause the adjacent carbons to have lower ppm. If there are two CH2Br groups, each would have a carbon peak below 60 ppm. So two peaks below 60 ppm. The rest of the carbons in the tetrahydronaphthalene would be part of the ring, maybe in the range above 100 ppm? Wait, no, tetrahydronaphthalene is a partially hydrogenated naphthalene. So if it's 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, that would be a bicyclic system where the first four hydrogens are added. So maybe the structure is like a six-membered ring fused with a five-membered ring? Not sure. The carbons not adjacent to bromine would be in the aromatic or aliphatic range. But if the rest are above 100 ppm, maybe they are aromatic-like? But tetrahydronaphthalene is partially saturated. The carbons in the saturated part would be around 20-50 ppm, but if they are not adjacent to bromine, maybe higher? Hmm. Wait, the problem states that in Product D's 13C NMR, there are two peaks below 60 ppm and the rest above 100 ppm. So only two carbons are below 60. If A has two bromine atoms on CH2 groups, their carbons would be below 60. The other carbons in the structure would be part of the ring. If the ring is aromatic or partially aromatic, their carbons might be above 100 ppm. So that fits with option A.\n\nSo putting it all together: Reactant A has one CH2 (single negative DEPT peak). After Friedel-Crafts, Product B still has one CH2. Then reduction with hydrazine adds another CH2 (so two CH2s in Product C). Then allylic bromination with NBS adds two bromines on allylic positions, which are on CH2 groups, leading to two peaks below 60 ppm. So the answer would be A. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the NBS reaction with peroxide usually leads to radical bromination. So if Product C has a structure with allylic positions, then bromination would add Br to those positions. If Product C has two CH2 groups that are allylic, then adding Br to each would give two Br atoms. So if Product C has two CH2 groups, and both are allylic, then Product D would have two Br on those CH2s. Hence, two peaks below 60 ppm. So that would fit with option A having two bromines. Therefore, Answer A.\n</think>"}
