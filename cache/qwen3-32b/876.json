Hmm, let me start by understanding what this equation represents. It has absolute value and both $ x $ and $ y $ terms, so maybe it's some kind of conic section? Let me try to rearrange or simplify it.\n\nFirst, I notice that there's an absolute value on the $ x $ term, which usually means the graph will have different behaviors depending on whether $ x $ is positive or negative. So maybe I should split the equation into two cases: one where $ x \\geq 0 $ and another where $ x < 0 $. Let me try that.\n\n**Case 1: $ x \\geq 0 $**\n\nIn this case, $ |x| = x $, so the equation becomes:\n\n$ y^2 + 2xy + 40x = 400 $\n\nHmm, maybe I can rearrange terms to see if it's a conic section. Let me try completing the square or something similar. Let me see:\n\nLooking at $ y^2 + 2xy $, that looks like part of a square. For example, $ (y + x)^2 = y^2 + 2xy + x^2 $. But in our equation, we have $ y^2 + 2xy $, so if I add and subtract $ x^2 $, maybe?\n\nLet me try:\n\n$ y^2 + 2xy + x^2 - x^2 + 40x = 400 $\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - x^2 + 40x = 400 $\n\nSimplify the terms with $ x $:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - x^2 + 40x = (y + x)^2 - (x^2 - 40x) $\n\nHmm, maybe complete the square for the quadratic in $ x $:\n\n$ x^2 - 40x = x^2 - 40x + 400 - 400 = (x - 20)^2 - 400 $\n\nWait, but in our equation, we have minus that, so:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - [(x - 20)^2 - 400] = 400 $\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - (x - 20)^2 + 400 = 400 $\n\nSubtract 400 from both sides:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - (x - 20)^2 = 0 $\n\nSo, $ (y + x)^2 = (x - 20)^2 $\n\nTaking square roots on both sides:\n\n$ y + x = \\pm (x - 20) $\n\nSo, solving for $ y $:\n\nFirst, the positive case:\n\n$ y + x = x - 20 $\n\nSubtract $ x $:\n\n$ y = -20 $\n\nSecond, the negative case:\n\n$ y + x = - (x - 20) = -x + 20 $\n\nSubtract $ x $:\n\n$ y + x + x = 20 $\n\nWait, let me redo that step:\n\nStarting with $ y + x = -x + 20 $\n\nBring the $ -x $ to the left and the $ y $ terms:\n\n$ y + x + x = 20 $\n\nSo $ y + 2x = 20 $\n\nTherefore, $ y = -2x + 20 $\n\nSo in the case where $ x \\geq 0 $, the equation simplifies to two lines: $ y = -20 $ and $ y = -2x + 20 $.\n\nWait, but is that all? Let me check my steps again. Starting from the original equation for $ x \\geq 0 $:\n\n$ y^2 + 2xy + 40x = 400 $\n\nThen I completed the square and ended up with $ (y + x)^2 = (x - 20)^2 $, leading to those two lines. So perhaps for $ x \\geq 0 $, the graph consists of those two lines? But lines usually don't form bounded regions by themselves. Maybe I need to check if there are more constraints?\n\nWait, but equations can sometimes represent lines or other curves. However, since we squared both sides, we need to make sure we didn't introduce extraneous solutions. Let me verify with a sample point.\n\nTake $ x = 0 $, plug into original equation:\n\n$ y^2 + 0 + 0 = 400 \\implies y^2 = 400 \\implies y = \\pm 20 $. But according to the equations I found for $ x \\geq 0 $, we have $ y = -20 $ and $ y = -2x + 20 $. At $ x = 0 $, the second equation gives $ y = 20 $. So that would give $ y = 20 $, which is another solution. Wait, but according to my previous steps, I only got $ y = -20 $ and $ y = -2x + 20 $. However, when $ x = 0 $, there should be two solutions for $ y $: 20 and -20. But according to my equations, only $ y = -20 $ and $ y = 20 $ when $ x = 0 $. Wait, but the equation $ y = -2x + 20 $ when $ x = 0 $ gives $ y = 20 $, so that's one solution, and $ y = -20 $ is another. So maybe those two lines cover both solutions? Let me check another point. Let's take $ x = 10 $. For the line $ y = -2x + 20 $, that would give $ y = -20 + 20 = 0 $. Plugging into original equation:\n\nLeft side: $ y^2 + 2xy + 40x = 0 + 2*10*0 + 40*10 = 400 $. Which is correct. Now check if there's another line for $ y = -20 $:\n\nAt $ x = 10 $, $ y = -20 $:\n\nLeft side: $ (-20)^2 + 2*10*(-20) + 40*10 = 400 - 400 + 400 = 400 $. Correct. So both lines satisfy the equation. But when I considered the case $ x \\geq 0 $, I ended up with two lines. But originally, when $ x = 0 $, there's another solution $ y = 20 $, but according to the equations, that's covered by $ y = -2x + 20 $. So maybe for $ x \\geq 0 $, the equation represents those two lines? But how can an equation reduce to two lines? Maybe it's a degenerate conic?\n\nBut then if that's the case, for $ x \\geq 0 $, we have two lines. Similarly, for $ x < 0 $, let's do the same analysis.\n\n**Case 2: $ x < 0 $**\n\nHere, $ |x| = -x $, so the equation becomes:\n\n$ y^2 + 2xy - 40x = 400 $\n\nAgain, let me try to complete the square or similar. Let's look at $ y^2 + 2xy $. Again, similar to before:\n\n$ y^2 + 2xy = (y + x)^2 - x^2 $\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - x^2 - 40x = 400 $\n\nWhich is:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - (x^2 + 40x) = 400 $\n\nAgain, complete the square for $ x^2 + 40x $:\n\n$ x^2 + 40x = x^2 + 40x + 400 - 400 = (x + 20)^2 - 400 $\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - [(x + 20)^2 - 400] = 400 $\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - (x + 20)^2 + 400 = 400 $\n\nSubtract 400 from both sides:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - (x + 20)^2 = 0 $\n\nTherefore:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 = (x + 20)^2 $\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n$ y + x = \\pm (x + 20) $\n\nSo solving for $ y $:\n\nFirst, positive case:\n\n$ y + x = x + 20 \\implies y = 20 $\n\nSecond, negative case:\n\n$ y + x = - (x + 20) = -x - 20 $\n\nBring terms together:\n\n$ y + x + x = -20 \\implies y + 2x = -20 \\implies y = -2x - 20 $\n\nTherefore, for $ x < 0 $, the equation simplifies to two lines: $ y = 20 $ and $ y = -2x - 20 $.\n\nAgain, let me check with sample points. For $ x = -10 $:\n\nFirst, for $ y = 20 $:\n\nLeft side: $ 20^2 + 2*(-10)*20 -40*(-10) = 400 - 400 + 400 = 400 $. Correct.\n\nFor $ y = -2x - 20 $, at $ x = -10 $, $ y = 20 - 20 = 0 $:\n\nLeft side: $ 0^2 + 2*(-10)*0 -40*(-10) = 0 + 0 + 400 = 400 $. Correct.\n\nAlso, check $ x = 0 $: Wait, but in this case $ x < 0 $, so approaching $ x = 0 $ from the left. If we plug $ x = 0 $, original equation becomes $ y^2 + 0 - 0 = 400 \\implies y = \\pm 20 $. The equations for $ x < 0 $ give $ y = 20 $ and $ y = -2x - 20 $. At $ x = 0 $, the second equation gives $ y = -20 $, so that's the other solution. So similar to the previous case.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the entire graph consists of four lines:\n\nFor $ x \\geq 0 $:\n\n1. $ y = -20 $\n2. $ y = -2x + 20 $\n\nFor $ x < 0 $:\n\n3. $ y = 20 $\n4. $ y = -2x - 20 $\n\nBut how do these lines form regions? Let me try to sketch them mentally or figure out their intersections.\n\nFirst, let's find where these lines intersect each other.\n\nStarting with the lines for $ x \\geq 0 $:\n\n1. $ y = -20 $\n2. $ y = -2x + 20 $\n\nThey intersect where $ -20 = -2x + 20 \\implies -2x = -40 \\implies x = 20 $. So intersection at (20, -20).\n\nSimilarly, for $ x < 0 $:\n\n3. $ y = 20 $\n4. $ y = -2x - 20 $\n\nThey intersect where $ 20 = -2x - 20 \\implies -2x = 40 \\implies x = -20 $. So intersection at (-20, 20).\n\nNow, we need to see how these lines interact with each other across the boundary at $ x = 0 $.\n\nLet me check the lines from $ x \\geq 0 $ and $ x < 0 $.\n\nFor example, the line $ y = -2x + 20 $ for $ x \\geq 0 $: when $ x = 0 $, $ y = 20 $. Similarly, the line $ y = 20 $ for $ x < 0 $ also passes through (0, 20). So these two lines connect at (0, 20).\n\nSimilarly, the line $ y = -20 $ for $ x \\geq 0 $ passes through (0, -20), and the line $ y = -2x - 20 $ for $ x < 0 $ also passes through (0, -20) when $ x = 0 $: $ y = -0 -20 = -20 $. So those two lines connect at (0, -20).\n\nTherefore, putting all together, the graph consists of four lines forming a diamond-like shape? Let me think.\n\nWe have two lines crossing at (0, 20) and (0, -20), and intersecting at (20, -20) and (-20, 20). Wait, let me try to visualize.\n\nThe four lines:\n\n1. $ y = -20 $ for all $ x \\geq 0 $. Wait, no, actually, the line $ y = -20 $ is only defined for $ x \\geq 0 $, but when $ x < 0 $, there's another line. Similarly for the others. Wait, but how do these lines extend?\n\nWait, actually, for $ x \\geq 0 $, we have two lines: $ y = -20 $ and $ y = -2x + 20 $. Similarly for $ x < 0 $, two lines: $ y = 20 $ and $ y = -2x - 20 $. But each of these lines is only valid for their respective regions of $ x $. However, maybe they connect at the boundaries?\n\nFor example, the line $ y = -2x + 20 $ for $ x \\geq 0 $ starts at (0, 20) and goes to (20, -20). Similarly, the line $ y = 20 $ for $ x < 0 $ would go from (0, 20) to the left. Similarly, the line $ y = -2x - 20 $ for $ x < 0 $ starts at (0, -20) and goes to (-20, 20), while the line $ y = -20 $ for $ x \\geq 0 $ goes from (0, -20) to the right.\n\nTherefore, connecting these lines, the entire graph is a polygon with vertices at (20, -20), (0, 20), (-20, 20), (0, -20), and back to (20, -20)? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, if we connect (20, -20) to (0, 20) via the line $ y = -2x + 20 $, then from (0, 20) going left along $ y = 20 $ to (-20, 20)? Wait, but the line $ y = 20 $ for $ x < 0 $, so as $ x $ approaches negative infinity? Wait, but does the equation hold for all $ x < 0 $?\n\nWait, let me check for $ x < 0 $, the line $ y = 20 $. Let me plug into the original equation:\n\nOriginal equation for $ x < 0 $: $ y^2 + 2xy - 40x = 400 $. If $ y = 20 $, then:\n\nLeft side: $ 20^2 + 2x*20 - 40x = 400 + 40x - 40x = 400 $. Yes, that works for any $ x $. So the line $ y = 20 $ is valid for all $ x < 0 $. Similarly, the line $ y = -20 $ is valid for all $ x \\geq 0 $.\n\nBut that seems to suggest that the graph has two horizontal lines at $ y = 20 $ (for all $ x < 0 $) and $ y = -20 $ (for all $ x \\geq 0 $), and two slanted lines connecting (0, 20) to (20, -20) and (0, -20) to (-20, 20). But if the horizontal lines extend infinitely, then the figure would have two infinite regions and maybe a bounded region? Wait, but the problem says the graph partitions the plane into several regions, and asks for the area of the bounded region.\n\nSo perhaps the bounded region is between these lines? Let me try to sketch mentally.\n\nImagine for $ x \\geq 0 $, the line $ y = -20 $ goes to the right infinitely, and the line $ y = -2x + 20 $ goes from (0, 20) down to (20, -20). Similarly, for $ x < 0 $, the line $ y = 20 $ goes to the left infinitely, and the line $ y = -2x - 20 $ goes from (0, -20) up to (-20, 20). Then connecting these, there is a diamond-shaped region between (0, 20), (-20, 20), (0, -20), and (20, -20)? Wait, but how?\n\nWait, if we have the horizontal lines at $ y = 20 $ for $ x < 0 $ and $ y = -20 $ for $ x \\geq 0 $, and the slanted lines connecting those points, maybe the bounded region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 20), (-20, 20), (0, -20), and (20, -20)? Let me check if those points are all on the graph.\n\n(0, 20): Plug into original equation: $ (20)^2 + 2*0*20 + 40|0| = 400 + 0 + 0 = 400 $. Correct.\n\n(-20, 20): Let's check. Since $ x = -20 < 0 $, equation becomes $ y^2 + 2xy - 40x = 400 $. Plug in:\n\n$ 20^2 + 2*(-20)*(20) -40*(-20) = 400 - 800 + 800 = 400 $. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (20, -20): $ x = 20 \\geq 0 $, equation is $ y^2 + 2xy + 40x = 400 $:\n\n$ (-20)^2 + 2*(20)*(-20) + 40*(20) = 400 - 800 + 800 = 400 $. Correct.\n\n(0, -20): Plug into original equation: same as (0, 20), gives 400. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the four points form a quadrilateral. But what shape is it? Let's see:\n\nThe points are (0, 20), (-20, 20), (0, -20), (20, -20). Connecting them in order, this would make a diamond shape, but actually, it's a kite-shaped figure? Or maybe a parallelogram?\n\nWait, let me compute the distances between the points.\n\nFrom (0, 20) to (-20, 20): distance is 20 units left, so 20.\n\nFrom (-20, 20) to (0, -20): distance is sqrt((20)^2 + (-40)^2) = sqrt(400 + 1600) = sqrt(2000) = 10*sqrt(20) = 10*2*sqrt(5) = 20*sqrt(5).\n\nFrom (0, -20) to (20, -20): 20 units right, distance 20.\n\nFrom (20, -20) to (0, 20): same as above, sqrt( ( -20)^2 + (40)^2 ) = same 20*sqrt(5).\n\nSo it's a kite with two sides of 20 and two sides of 20√5. However, the area can be calculated if we know the diagonals. The diagonals are from (0,20) to (0,-20): length 40, and from (-20,20) to (20,-20): let's calculate that.\n\nThe diagonal from (-20, 20) to (20, -20): the length is sqrt( (40)^2 + (-40)^2 ) = sqrt(3200) = 40√2. But actually, for area of a kite, the formula is (d1*d2)/2.\n\nBut wait, if we consider the two diagonals:\n\nFirst diagonal: vertical from (0,20) to (0,-20): length 40.\n\nSecond diagonal: from (-20, 20) to (20, -20). Wait, but in a kite, the diagonals are the ones that cross each other perpendicularly. However, in this case, is that true?\n\nWait, actually, if we think of the figure as a quadrilateral with vertices at those four points, maybe it's not a kite but another shape. Alternatively, perhaps it's a parallelogram? Let me check the slopes of the sides.\n\nFrom (0,20) to (-20,20): horizontal line, slope 0.\n\nFrom (-20,20) to (0,-20): slope is (-20 - 20)/(0 - (-20)) = (-40)/20 = -2.\n\nFrom (0,-20) to (20,-20): horizontal line, slope 0.\n\nFrom (20,-20) to (0,20): slope is (20 - (-20))/(0 - 20) = 40/(-20) = -2? Wait, no:\n\nWait (20, -20) to (0, 20): rise is 20 - (-20) = 40, run is 0 - 20 = -20, so slope is 40 / (-20) = -2. Yes.\n\nSo actually, the sides are two horizontal lines and two lines with slope -2. Wait, but if we connect (0,20) to (-20,20) to (0,-20) to (20,-20) to (0,20), this creates a quadrilateral that is symmetric over both axes? Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's two triangles? Or perhaps it's a combination of shapes. However, if I think of the area, since we have coordinates for all four vertices, maybe I can use the shoelace formula.\n\nLet me list the coordinates in order. Let's take the quadrilateral with vertices:\n\nA(0, 20), B(-20, 20), C(0, -20), D(20, -20). Wait, but connecting A to B to C to D to A?\n\nWait, but connecting A(0,20) to B(-20,20) to C(0,-20) to D(20,-20) to A(0,20). Let me visualize this. From A to B is left along y=20. Then down to C(0,-20). Then to D(20,-20), then back to A. This figure is actually a non-convex quadrilateral? Wait, no, actually, when connecting those points, it's a bowtie shape? Wait, but if you connect A(0,20) to B(-20,20) to C(0,-20) to D(20,-20) to A(0,20), it's actually two triangles: ABC and ACD?\n\nWait, but if you draw that, it would cross over itself? Wait, no. From B(-20,20) to C(0,-20): that's a line going from (-20,20) to (0,-20). Then from C(0,-20) to D(20,-20): right along y=-20. Then from D(20,-20) back to A(0,20): line from (20,-20) to (0,20). So actually, the figure is a quadrilateral that looks like a diamond but with two horizontal sides? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bounded region is actually the area enclosed by all four lines. But since two of the lines extend infinitely, how is there a bounded region? Wait, maybe the bounded region is between the four lines? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph is not just those four lines, but also includes other parts? Wait, no. When we split into cases, we found that for each x, the equation reduces to those lines. So the entire graph is those four lines. However, if you have two horizontal lines and two slanted lines, they might form a closed region.\n\nWait, if you imagine the line y = 20 for x < 0, going to the left, the line y = -2x -20 for x < 0 going from (0, -20) to (-20, 20). Similarly, for the right side, the line y = -20 for x >= 0 going to the right, and the line y = -2x + 20 going from (0, 20) to (20, -20). So if you think of these four lines, they form a closed quadrilateral with vertices at (-20, 20), (0, 20), (20, -20), (0, -20). Wait, but how?\n\nWait, actually, if you connect (-20, 20) to (0, 20) along y=20 (for x < 0 to x=0), then from (0, 20) down along y = -2x + 20 to (20, -20), then from (20, -20) left along y = -20 (for x >= 0 to x=0), then up along y = -2x -20 from (0, -20) to (-20, 20). So yes, that makes a closed quadrilateral with vertices at (-20, 20), (0, 20), (20, -20), (0, -20), and back to (-20, 20). So that is a quadrilateral, and this is the bounded region. The other parts of the lines go off to infinity, creating unbounded regions, but this quadrilateral is the bounded one.\n\nTherefore, to find the area of this quadrilateral, we can use the shoelace formula. Let me apply that.\n\nFirst, list the coordinates of the quadrilateral in order. Let me take them in order:\n\n(-20, 20), (0, 20), (20, -20), (0, -20), back to (-20, 20).\n\nLet me write them as points:\n\nA(-20, 20)\n\nB(0, 20)\n\nC(20, -20)\n\nD(0, -20)\n\nBack to A(-20, 20)\n\nShoelace formula:\n\nArea = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, between A and B:\n\nx_i = -20, y_i = 20\n\nx_{i+1} = 0, y_{i+1} = 20\n\nTerm: (-20)(20) - (0)(20) = -400 - 0 = -400\n\nSecond, between B and C:\n\nx_i = 0, y_i = 20\n\nx_{i+1} = 20, y_{i+1} = -20\n\nTerm: 0*(-20) - 20*20 = 0 - 400 = -400\n\nThird, between C and D:\n\nx_i = 20, y_i = -20\n\nx_{i+1} = 0, y_{i+1} = -20\n\nTerm: 20*(-20) - 0*(-20) = -400 - 0 = -400\n\nFourth, between D and A:\n\nx_i = 0, y_i = -20\n\nx_{i+1} = -20, y_{i+1} = 20\n\nTerm: 0*(20) - (-20)*(-20) = 0 - 400 = -400\n\nSum of all terms: -400 -400 -400 -400 = -1600\n\nTake absolute value and multiply by 1/2:\n\nArea = (1/2)*| -1600 | = (1/2)(1600) = 800\n\nWait, that gives 800. But let me check if I did the shoelace correctly. Maybe I messed up the order of the points or the formula.\n\nWait, actually, the shoelace formula is sum over x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i. Let me recast the coordinates properly.\n\nLet me write down the coordinates again:\n\nA(-20, 20)\n\nB(0, 20)\n\nC(20, -20)\n\nD(0, -20)\n\nBack to A(-20, 20)\n\nCompute each x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i:\n\nFirst term: A to B:\n\nx_A * y_B - x_B * y_A = (-20)(20) - (0)(20) = -400 - 0 = -400\n\nSecond term: B to C:\n\nx_B * y_C - x_C * y_B = (0)(-20) - (20)(20) = 0 - 400 = -400\n\nThird term: C to D:\n\nx_C * y_D - x_D * y_C = (20)(-20) - (0)(-20) = -400 - 0 = -400\n\nFourth term: D to A:\n\nx_D * y_A - x_A * y_D = (0)(20) - (-20)(-20) = 0 - 400 = -400\n\nTotal sum: -400 -400 -400 -400 = -1600. Absolute value 1600, times 1/2 is 800. So area is 800? But let me think again. Is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have taken the points in a different order? Maybe clockwise vs counter-clockwise? But regardless, the absolute value should take care of that. But let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, since the figure is a quadrilateral symmetric over both axes? Wait, let's see. The figure has points (-20,20), (0,20), (20,-20), (0,-20). If we reflect over y-axis, (-20,20) becomes (20,20), which is not part of the figure. Wait, maybe not symmetric over axes. However, maybe we can split it into two triangles or something.\n\nFor example, split the quadrilateral into two triangles: triangle ABC and triangle ACD?\n\nWait, points A(-20,20), B(0,20), C(20,-20), D(0,-20). Let me split into triangle ABD and BCD? Maybe not. Alternatively, connect A to C, splitting into two triangles: ABC and ACD.\n\nFirst triangle ABC: points A(-20,20), B(0,20), C(20,-20).\n\nArea of ABC: Using shoelace formula for triangle:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nA(-20,20), B(0,20), C(20,-20), back to A.\n\nCompute:\n\n(-20)(20) + 0*(-20) + 20(20) - [20(0) + 20(20) + (-20)(-20)]\n\nWait, maybe better to use determinant formula:\n\nArea = 1/2 |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|\n\nPlugging in:\n\nx1 = -20, y1 = 20\n\nx2 = 0, y2 = 20\n\nx3 = 20, y3 = -20\n\nArea = 1/2 | (-20)(20 - (-20)) + 0*(-20 - 20) + 20(20 - 20) |\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 1/2 | (-20)(40) + 0 + 20(0) | = 1/2 | -800 | = 400\n\nThen triangle ACD: points A(-20,20), C(20,-20), D(0,-20)\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nx1 = -20, y1 = 20\n\nx2 = 20, y2 = -20\n\nx3 = 0, y3 = -20\n\nArea = 1/2 | (-20)(-20 - (-20)) + 20*(-20 - 20) + 0*(20 - (-20)) |\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 1/2 | (-20)(0) + 20*(-40) + 0 | = 1/2 | 0 - 800 + 0 | = 1/2 * 800 = 400\n\nTotal area of quadrilateral: 400 + 400 = 800. Same as before. So that seems to confirm that the area is 800. But let me check with yet another method.\n\nAlternatively, since the figure is a kite? Wait, if we consider the two diagonals. Earlier, I thought of the vertical diagonal as 40 (from (0,20) to (0,-20)) and the other diagonal from (-20,20) to (20,-20). Let me calculate the lengths:\n\nVertical diagonal: 40 units.\n\nOther diagonal: distance between (-20,20) and (20,-20): sqrt[(20 - (-20))² + (-20 - 20)²] = sqrt[(40)^2 + (-40)^2] = sqrt(1600 + 1600) = sqrt(3200) = 40√2.\n\nBut for a kite, area is (d1*d2)/2. However, is this a kite? In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me check if the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nThe vertical diagonal is along the y-axis, and the other diagonal goes from (-20,20) to (20,-20). The slope of that diagonal is (-20 - 20)/(20 - (-20)) = (-40)/40 = -1. The vertical line has an undefined slope, so they are perpendicular? Wait, a vertical line and a line with slope -1: yes, they are perpendicular? Wait, no. Wait, if one line is vertical (undefined slope), and another line has slope m, they are perpendicular if m is 0? No, a vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line. A line with slope -1 is not perpendicular to vertical. Wait, slope of -1 means that the angle with horizontal is 135 degrees, so the angle between vertical (90 degrees) and that line is 45 degrees. Not perpendicular. Therefore, my assumption that it's a kite with diagonals is wrong. Therefore, the formula (d1*d2)/2 does not apply here. Hence, my previous calculation with shoelace and splitting into triangles giving 800 is correct.\n\nBut let me check with coordinate axes. Maybe we can compute the area by integrating or something else?\n\nAlternatively, notice that the figure is a parallelogram? Wait, looking at the sides:\n\nFrom (-20,20) to (0,20): horizontal line, length 20.\n\nFrom (0,20) to (20,-20): slope -2, length sqrt( (20)^2 + (-40)^2 ) = sqrt(400 + 1600) = sqrt(2000) = 20√5.\n\nFrom (20,-20) to (0,-20): horizontal line left, length 20.\n\nFrom (0,-20) to (-20,20): slope -2, same length 20√5.\n\nSo opposite sides are equal and parallel? The sides from (-20,20)-(0,20) and (0,-20)-(20,-20) are both horizontal, same slope 0. The other sides have slope -2. Therefore, it's a parallelogram. Therefore, area of a parallelogram is base * height.\n\nTake base as 20 (the horizontal side). What is the height?\n\nBut need to find the distance between the two parallel sides. The two horizontal sides are at y=20 (left part) and y=-20 (right part). Wait, but they are not parallel in the sense that they are horizontal but on different sides. Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, the distance between the two horizontal sides would be the vertical distance between y=20 and y=-20? But that's 40. However, since the parallelogram is slanting, maybe not. Wait, no. Actually, in a parallelogram, the base is one side, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases.\n\nBut if we take the base as the horizontal segment from (-20,20) to (0,20), which is 20 units long, then the height would be the vertical distance from this base to the opposite side, which is the horizontal segment from (0,-20) to (20,-20). However, since those are horizontal lines, the vertical distance between y=20 and y=-20 is 40. However, in a parallelogram, if the sides are not vertical, the height isn't necessarily the vertical distance. Wait, but in this case, since the sides connecting them are slanting with slope -2, the height would actually be the vertical distance? Wait, no. Wait, if the base is horizontal, then the height is vertical distance. Because the height is measured perpendicular to the base. Since the base is horizontal, the height is vertical. Therefore, area would be base * height = 20 * 40 = 800. Which matches our previous result. So that's another way to see it. Therefore, area is 800.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the graph of [...] partitions the plane into several regions. What is the area of the bounded region?\" So according to my calculation, it's 800. But let me check with another approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize the region. Since the figure is a parallelogram, we can also compute the vectors of the sides and take the cross product.\n\nFrom point A(-20, 20) to B(0, 20): vector is (20, 0)\n\nFrom point A(-20, 20) to D(0, -20): vector is (20, -40)\n\nArea of parallelogram is the magnitude of the cross product of these vectors.\n\nCross product in 2D is scalar magnitude |ax*by - ay*bx|.\n\nHere, vector AB is (20, 0), vector AD is (20, -40).\n\nCross product is 20*(-40) - 0*20 = -800 - 0 = -800. The magnitude is 800, so area is 800. Correct again. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, seems like the area is 800. But let me check if I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the bounded region. Because originally, the equation reduces to four lines, but maybe there are other regions?\n\nWait, the original equation is $ y^2 + 2xy + 40|x| = 400 $. When we split into cases, we found that for each x, it reduces to two lines. But maybe there are other curves? Or maybe those four lines are the entire graph? Let me check another point inside the supposed bounded region.\n\nTake the origin (0, 0). Plug into the equation: $ 0 + 0 + 40*0 = 0 ≠ 400 $. So origin is not on the graph. Now, check if the origin is inside the bounded region. The bounded region is the parallelogram we found. Since the origin is inside that parallelogram? Let me see.\n\nThe parallelogram has vertices at (-20,20), (0,20), (20,-20), (0,-20). The origin (0,0) is inside. If I plug into the original equation, it doesn't satisfy, so the origin is inside a region bounded by the graph. Therefore, the area of that bounded region is 800. But let me check another point inside.\n\nTake (10, 0). Plug into equation: $ 0^2 + 2*10*0 + 40*10 = 400 $. 0 + 0 + 400 = 400. Oh, so (10, 0) is on the graph? Wait, but according to our previous analysis, the graph consists of four lines. Is (10, 0) on one of those lines?\n\nCheck for x=10 (positive), the lines are y=-20 and y=-2x + 20. For x=10, y=-2*10 + 20 = 0. So yes, (10, 0) is on the line y=-2x + 20. Therefore, it's on the graph. So that point is on the edge. How about (5, 0)? Plug into equation: $ 0 + 2*5*0 + 40*5 = 200 ≠ 400 $. So (5, 0) is not on the graph, and lies inside the region bounded by the parallelogram? Wait, if (10, 0) is on the edge, then (5, 0) is inside. But according to the equation, it doesn't satisfy, so it's inside the bounded region. Therefore, seems okay.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are other bounded regions. For example, sometimes absolute value equations can have multiple loops or something. But given that we have four lines forming a single parallelogram, and the rest of the graph goes to infinity, I think there's only one bounded region, which is the parallelogram with area 800.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another point outside. Take (0, 0) is inside, (10, 0) is on the edge, (20, -20) is a vertex. How about ( -10, 0 )? Plug into equation: $ 0^2 + 2*(-10)*0 + 40*|-10| = 0 + 0 + 400 = 400 $. So (-10, 0) is on the graph. According to our lines, for x < 0, the lines are y=20 and y=-2x -20. For x=-10, y=-2*(-10) -20 = 20 -20 = 0. Correct. So (-10, 0) is on the line y=-2x -20. Therefore, that point is on the graph. Therefore, the figure seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is that the area is 800. However, just to be 100% sure, let me check if there's any possible mistake in interpreting the equation.\n\nOriginal equation: $ y^2 + 2xy + 40|x| = 400 $. When I split into cases, I assumed that for each x, the equation reduces to two lines. But maybe there's more to it? For example, suppose I consider that when solving $ (y + x)^2 = (x - 20)^2 $, we get $ y + x = \\pm (x - 20) $. But squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, since we derived it through completing the square and checking sample points, it seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the original equation. Let me try to rearrange it:\n\nOriginal equation: $ y^2 + 2xy + 40|x| = 400 $. Let me try to write it as $ y^2 + 2xy = 400 - 40|x| $. Maybe complete the square in terms of y?\n\n$ y^2 + 2xy = (y + x)^2 - x^2 $, so:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 - x^2 = 400 - 40|x| $\n\nRearranged:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 = x^2 + 400 - 40|x| $\n\nLet me denote $ |x| = t $, where $ t \\geq 0 $. Then, since $ x^2 = t^2 $, the equation becomes:\n\n$ (y + x)^2 = t^2 + 400 - 40t $\n\nBut $ x = \\pm t $, depending on the sign. However, this might not help much. Let me consider specific cases again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider substituting variables. Let me set u = y + x. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$ u^2 - x^2 + 40|x| = 400 $. Wait, that's similar to what I had before. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equation as quadratic in y:\n\n$ y^2 + 2x y + (40|x| - 400) = 0 $\n\nSolving for y:\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\n$ y = \\frac{ -2x \\pm \\sqrt{(2x)^2 - 4*1*(40|x| - 400)} }{2} $\n\nSimplify discriminant:\n\n$ 4x^2 - 160|x| + 1600 $\n\nFactor out 4:\n\n$ 4[ x^2 - 40|x| + 400 ] $\n\nSo,\n\n$ y = \\frac{ -2x \\pm 2\\sqrt{ x^2 - 40|x| + 400 } }{2} = -x \\pm \\sqrt{ x^2 - 40|x| + 400 } $\n\nHmm, let's analyze the expression under the square root:\n\n$ x^2 - 40|x| + 400 $. Let me denote $ t = |x| $, so expression becomes $ t^2 - 40t + 400 $. Let me compute discriminant for this quadratic in t:\n\nDiscriminant: 1600 - 1600 = 0. Wait, discriminant of $ t^2 - 40t + 400 $ is $ 1600 - 1600 = 0 $. Therefore, it factors as a perfect square:\n\n$ t^2 - 40t + 400 = (t - 20)^2 $. Yes! Because $ (t - 20)^2 = t^2 - 40t + 400 $. Perfect!\n\nTherefore, sqrt of that is |t - 20| = ||x| - 20|. Since t = |x| ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, going back:\n\n$ y = -x \\pm ||x| - 20| $\n\nTherefore, the equation simplifies to $ y = -x \\pm ||x| - 20| $. Interesting. Let me analyze this expression.\n\nLet me consider cases based on the value of |x| - 20, which depends on |x| compared to 20.\n\nSo, for |x| ≥ 20, ||x| - 20| = |x| - 20.\n\nFor |x| < 20, ||x| - 20| = 20 - |x|.\n\nTherefore, splitting into cases:\n\n**Case 1: |x| ≥ 20**\n\nThen, $ y = -x \\pm (|x| - 20) $\n\nWhich gives two possibilities:\n\n1. $ y = -x + |x| - 20 $\n2. $ y = -x - |x| + 20 $\n\nLet me analyze these for different signs of x.\n\n**Subcase 1a: x ≥ 20**\n\nThen |x| = x, so:\n\n1. $ y = -x + x - 20 = -20 $\n2. $ y = -x - x + 20 = -2x + 20 $\n\nBut since x ≥ 20, for the second equation, y = -2x + 20. When x = 20, y = -40 + 20 = -20. As x increases beyond 20, y becomes more negative. But note that in this case, the original equation for x ≥ 0 was already considered earlier, and we found lines y = -20 and y = -2x + 20. So this is consistent.\n\n**Subcase 1b: x ≤ -20**\n\nThen |x| = -x, so:\n\n1. $ y = -x + (-x) - 20 = -2x - 20 $\n2. $ y = -x - (-x) + 20 = -x + x + 20 = 20 $\n\nWhich again matches our previous results for x < 0: y = 20 and y = -2x - 20.\n\n**Case 2: |x| < 20**\n\nThen, ||x| - 20| = 20 - |x|, so:\n\n$ y = -x \\pm (20 - |x|) $\n\nWhich gives:\n\n1. $ y = -x + 20 - |x| $\n2. $ y = -x - 20 + |x| $\n\nLet me analyze these for different signs of x.\n\n**Subcase 2a: x ≥ 0**\n\nSince |x| = x:\n\n1. $ y = -x + 20 - x = -2x + 20 $\n2. $ y = -x - 20 + x = -20 $\n\nWhich again matches our previous results for x ≥ 0: y = -2x + 20 and y = -20.\n\n**Subcase 2b: x < 0**\n\nHere, |x| = -x:\n\n1. $ y = -x + 20 - (-x) = -x + 20 + x = 20 $\n2. $ y = -x - 20 + (-x) = -x - 20 - x = -2x - 20 $\n\nWhich again matches our previous results for x < 0: y = 20 and y = -2x - 20.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the case, the equation simplifies to those four lines. Therefore, there are no other curves or regions; the entire graph is composed of those four lines. Therefore, the bounded region is indeed the parallelogram with area 800.\n\nBut let me just check if there's a possibility of another bounded region. For example, sometimes absolute value equations can have multiple components, but in this case, since we have only lines extending to infinity except for the parallelogram, I don't think so. Therefore, I think 800 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me recall that when I did the shoelace formula, I got 800, and cross-checked with splitting into triangles and parallelogram area, also getting 800. Therefore, I think confident that the area is 800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{800}\n</think>"}
