Alright, let me start by recalling some properties of cube roots of unity. \n\nFirst, the equation $\\omega^3 = 1$ has three solutions: the real number 1 and two complex numbers. These are called the cube roots of unity. The roots are $1$, $\\omega$, and $\\omega^2$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity. I remember that these roots satisfy the equation $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$. That seems important. Maybe I can use that identity later on.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the value of $\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}$. Let me try to compute this expression. Let me first combine the two fractions. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are $1 + \\omega$ and $1 + \\omega^2$, so the common denominator would be $(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)$. \n\nLet me write out the numerator:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n$$\n(1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega) = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n$$\n\nNow, from the identity I mentioned earlier, $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$, so $\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1$. Therefore, substituting that into the numerator:\n\n$$\n2 + (-1) = 1\n$$\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to 1. Now, let me compute the denominator: $(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)$. Let me expand this:\n\n$$\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2\n$$\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n- $1 \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^2$\n- $\\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega$\n- $\\omega \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^3$\n\nBut $\\omega^3 = 1$, so the last term is 1. Therefore, combining all these:\n\n$$\n1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n$$\n\nAgain, using the identity $\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1$, this becomes:\n\n$$\n2 + (-1) = 1\n$$\n\nSo the denominator is also 1. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to $\\frac{1}{1} = 1$. Wait, so does that mean the value is always 1? But the question says \"find all possible values\". Hmm. Is there more than one value?\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The problem states that $\\omega$ is a complex number such that $\\omega^3 = 1$. So, there are three cube roots of unity: 1, $\\omega$, and $\\omega^2$. However, if $\\omega = 1$, then the original expression becomes undefined? Let me check that.\n\nIf $\\omega = 1$, then the denominators become $1 + 1 = 2$ and $1 + 1^2 = 2$, so the expression would be $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$. Wait, so even when $\\omega = 1$, the expression is 1? But then all three roots give the same value? But maybe when $\\omega = 1$, the denominators are not zero, so it's allowed. However, the problem says \"complex number\", but 1 is a real number. However, since it's a complex number (real numbers are a subset of complex numbers), it's allowed.\n\nBut maybe there's something wrong here. Let me check with specific values. Let me take $\\omega$ as a primitive cube root of unity. Let me recall that $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3} = -1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2$, and $\\omega^2 = e^{4\\pi i /3} = -1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2$. Let me compute the original expression with these values.\n\nFirst, compute $1 + \\omega$:\n\n$1 + \\omega = 1 + (-1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2$. Similarly, $1 + \\omega^2 = 1 + (-1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2$.\n\nSo, $\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} = \\frac{1}{1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2}$. To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2} \\cdot \\frac{1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2}{1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2}{(1/2)^2 + (\\sqrt{3}/2)^2} = \\frac{1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2}{1/4 + 3/4} = \\frac{1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2}{1} = 1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2}$. Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2} \\cdot \\frac{1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2}{1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2}{1/4 + 3/4} = \\frac{1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2}{1} = 1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2\n$$\n\nAdding these two results:\n\n$$\n(1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2) + (1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i\\sqrt{3}/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2) = 1 + 0 = 1\n$$\n\nSo indeed, when $\\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity, the expression evaluates to 1. What about when $\\omega = 1$? Let's check that case.\n\nIf $\\omega = 1$, then the expression becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n$$\n\nSo even in this case, the value is 1. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity we take, the expression evaluates to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"find all possible values\". Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Let me check if there are different possible values depending on which root we take? But as shown, for all three roots (1, $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$), the expression evaluates to 1. Therefore, there's only one possible value, which is 1. \n\nBut let me think again. Is there a case where the expression is undefined? For example, if the denominators are zero? Let's check. For which $\\omega$ is $1 + \\omega = 0$ or $1 + \\omega^2 = 0$?\n\nIf $1 + \\omega = 0$, then $\\omega = -1$. But $\\omega^3 = (-1)^3 = -1 \\neq 1$, so -1 is not a cube root of unity. Similarly, $1 + \\omega^2 = 0$ implies $\\omega^2 = -1$, so $\\omega = \\pm i$. But $i^3 = -i \\neq 1$ and $(-i)^3 = i \\neq 1$, so neither of these are cube roots of unity. Therefore, for all cube roots of unity, the denominators are non-zero, so the expression is defined, and evaluates to 1 in all cases. \n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me try another approach. Suppose I didn't use the identity $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$, but instead tried to compute the expression directly. Let me verify again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n$$\n\nCombine fractions:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3}\n$$\n\nWait, earlier I expanded the denominator as $(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)$ and got $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3$. Since $\\omega^3 = 1$, that becomes $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2$. Then using $\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1$, so denominator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1. Numerator is also 2 + (-1) = 1, so 1/1 = 1. \n\nYes, same result. Therefore, regardless of which cube root we take (as long as denominators are non-zero, which they are), the value is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. \n\nBut let me check once more with actual numbers. Let me take $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3}$. Let me compute numerically:\n\nFirst, compute $\\omega$:\n\n$$\n\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3} = \\cos(2\\pi/3) + i \\sin(2\\pi/3) = -1/2 + i (\\sqrt{3}/2)\n$$\n\nCompute $1 + \\omega$:\n\n$$\n1 + (-1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2\n$$\n\nCompute $1/(1 + \\omega)$:\n\nAs before, that's $1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2$\n\nSimilarly for $1/(1 + \\omega^2)$ is $1/2 + i \\sqrt{3}/2$, adding them gives 1. \n\nAlternatively, if I use decimal approximations. Let me compute numerically:\n\nLet me take $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$, so $\\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866$. Then $1 + \\omega \\approx 0.5 + i 0.866$. The reciprocal of this can be calculated as follows. The modulus of $0.5 + i 0.866$ is $\\sqrt{0.25 + 0.75} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. Therefore, the reciprocal has modulus 1, and angle is negative of the original angle. The original angle is 2π/3, so reciprocal has angle -2π/3, which is equivalent to 4π/3. But 4π/3 corresponds to $\\cos(4π/3) + i \\sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - i \\sqrt{3}/2$, which matches the earlier result. Similarly for the other term. Adding them gives (-1/2 - (-1/2)) for real parts? Wait, no:\n\nWait, 1/(1 + ω) ≈ -1/2 - i√3/2? Wait no, earlier we had 1/(1 + ω) = 1/2 - i√3/2. Wait, modulus 1, angle -2π/3. Let me compute cos(-2π/3) = cos(2π/3) = -1/2? Wait cos(-θ) = cosθ, sin(-θ) = -sinθ. Therefore, cos(-2π/3) = cos(2π/3) = -1/2, sin(-2π/3) = -sin(2π/3) = -√3/2. Therefore, 1/(1 + ω) is -1/2 - i√3/2? Wait but earlier algebra gave me 1/2 - i√3/2. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait let me recast. Let me compute $1 + \\omega$ again. If $\\omega = e^{2πi/3} = -1/2 + i√3/2$, then 1 + ω is 1 - 1/2 + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2. Therefore, modulus squared is (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So modulus is 1. The angle of 1 + ω is arctangent of ( (√3/2) / (1/2) ) = arctangent(√3) = π/3. Therefore, 1 + ω is e^{iπ/3}. Therefore, reciprocal is e^{-iπ/3} = cos(-π/3) + i sin(-π/3) = 1/2 - i√3/2. Which matches the algebra result. Earlier confusion was because I thought angle was -2π/3, but actually the angle of 1 + ω is π/3, so reciprocal is -π/3. Makes sense. So 1/(1 + ω) is 1/2 - i√3/2 and 1/(1 + ω^2) is 1/2 + i√3/2. Adding them gives 1. Correct. \n\nTherefore, all checks out. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity we take, the value is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. \n\nBut the problem says \"Find all possible values\". Maybe there is only one possible value? Because even though there are three cube roots of unity, the expression evaluates to same value for each. Therefore, the answer is just 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a case where the expression is different? Let me think again. Suppose someone thought that ω is any complex number with ω³ = 1, but maybe there are different possibilities? But there are only three cube roots of unity, and for each of them, the expression is 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe when simplifying algebraically, we assumed that ω ≠ 1? Wait, no, even when ω = 1, we have 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So even in that case, same result. Therefore, regardless of ω, as long as ω³ = 1, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>"}
