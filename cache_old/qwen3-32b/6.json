The answer choices are given as A:31.00%, B:0.164, C:0.311, D:0.5. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, weight percent (or mass percent) means that 50% of the total mass of the solution is NaOH, and the remaining 50% is water. Mole fraction, on the other hand, is the number of moles of a component divided by the total number of moles in the solution. So I need to convert the mass percentages into moles.\n\nTo do this, I can assume a convenient total mass for the solution. Let me assume 100 grams of solution because percentages will make calculations easier. In this case, 50 grams would be NaOH and 50 grams would be water (H2O).\n\nNow, I need to calculate the number of moles of NaOH and the number of moles of water.\n\nStarting with NaOH. The molar mass of NaOH is needed. Let me recall the atomic masses: sodium (Na) is about 22.99 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) is 1.01 g/mol. So adding those up: 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol. So the molar mass of NaOH is 40.00 g/mol.\n\nSo moles of NaOH = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 40.00 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 50 divided by 40 is 1.25 moles of NaOH.\n\nNext, water. The molar mass of H2O is 2*(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol. So moles of water = 50 g / 18.02 g/mol. Let me compute that. 50 divided by 18.02 is approximately... Let me do the division. 18.02 times 2 is 36.04, subtract that from 50, you get 13.96. 18.02 goes into 13.96 about 0.774 times. So total is approximately 2.774 moles of water? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 18.02 g/mol is the molar mass. So 50 divided by 18.02. Let me use a calculator step here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approximate. 18.02 is roughly 18. So 50 / 18 ≈ 2.777... So approximately 2.778 moles. But since the actual molar mass is slightly more than 18, the actual number of moles will be slightly less. Let me compute 50 / 18.02 precisely.\n\nLet me compute 18.02 * 2.77 = 18 * 2.77 + 0.02 * 2.77 = 49.86 + 0.0554 = 49.9154. That's very close to 50. So 2.77 moles would give approximately 49.9154 grams. So to get exactly 50 grams, it's slightly more than 2.77. Let me do a better approximation.\n\nLet me use the formula:\n\nmoles = 50 / 18.02 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 18.02 × 2.77 = 50.0... as above. So approximately 2.774 moles. Let me just take 2.774 moles for water.\n\nSo total moles in the solution is moles of NaOH + moles of water = 1.25 + 2.774 ≈ 4.024 moles.\n\nThen, the mole fraction of NaOH is moles of NaOH divided by total moles. So that's 1.25 / 4.024 ≈ ?\n\nCalculating that: 1.25 / 4.024. Let me compute this division.\n\nFirst, 4.024 goes into 1.25 how many times? Let me convert to decimals. 1.25 divided by 4.024. Let me approximate this.\n\nWell, 4.024 × 0.3 = 1.2072. So 0.3 times 4.024 is 1.2072. Subtract that from 1.25: 1.25 - 1.2072 = 0.0428. Now, how much more is that? So 0.0428 / 4.024 ≈ 0.0106. So total mole fraction ≈ 0.3 + 0.0106 ≈ 0.3106, approximately 0.311. So that would be option C: 0.311.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be precise. Maybe I approximated too much.\n\nLet me redo the calculation for moles of water. 50 grams divided by 18.02 g/mol. Let me do this division more accurately.\n\nLet me use the exact value:\n\nmoles of H2O = 50 / 18.02 ≈ 2.7747 moles. So that's precise.\n\nThen total moles is 1.25 + 2.7747 = 4.0247 moles.\n\nThen mole fraction of NaOH is 1.25 / 4.0247 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 1.25 / 4.0247. Let me use decimal division.\n\nAlternatively, let me write this as a fraction: 1.25 / 4.0247.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 1250 / 4024.7 ≈ ?\n\nAlternatively, use approximate decimal division:\n\nLet me note that 4.0247 × 0.31 = 4.0247 × 0.3 + 4.0247 × 0.01 = 1.2074 + 0.0402 = 1.2476. Which is very close to 1.25. So 0.31 gives 1.2476, which is just slightly less than 1.25. The difference is 1.25 - 1.2476 = 0.0024.\n\nSo how much more than 0.31 do we need? Let me call the mole fraction x = 0.31 + Δx, such that (4.0247)(0.31 + Δx) = 1.25.\n\nWe have 4.0247*0.31 + 4.0247*Δx = 1.25.\n\nWe already know 4.0247*0.31 ≈ 1.2476.\n\nSo 1.2476 + 4.0247*Δx = 1.25.\n\nThus, 4.0247*Δx = 1.25 - 1.2476 = 0.0024.\n\nTherefore, Δx ≈ 0.0024 / 4.0247 ≈ 0.000596.\n\nTherefore, x ≈ 0.31 + 0.000596 ≈ 0.3106. So approximately 0.3106, which rounds to 0.311. Therefore, the mole fraction is approximately 0.311, which is option C.\n\nBut let me check if I did all steps correctly. Let me verify the initial assumption.\n\nAssuming 100 g solution: 50 g NaOH and 50 g H2O. Correct.\n\nMolar mass of NaOH: 40.00 g/mol. Correct.\n\nMolar mass of H2O: 18.02 g/mol. Correct.\n\nMoles of NaOH: 50 / 40 = 1.25. Correct.\n\nMoles of H2O: 50 / 18.02 ≈ 2.7747. Correct.\n\nTotal moles ≈ 1.25 + 2.7747 ≈ 4.0247. Correct.\n\nMole fraction ≈ 1.25 / 4.0247 ≈ 0.3106 ≈ 0.311. So option C is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there is any possibility of error in the calculation. For example, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the molar masses?\n\nNaOH: Na is 22.99, O is 16.00, H is 1.01. Adding up: 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol. Correct.\n\nH2O: 2*(1.01) + 16.00 = 2.02 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol. Correct.\n\nSo the molar masses are correct. The rest of the calculations follow. So the answer should be 0.311, option C.\n\nBut let me check if the answer choices are given as percentages or decimals. The options are A:31.00% B:0.164 C:0.311 D:0.5. So C is 0.311, which is a decimal, and mole fraction is unitless, so that's correct. So answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the weight percent is equal to mole fraction (which it's not), they might pick D:0.5, but that's incorrect. So answer C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C:0.311.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>"}
