So, there are four options (A to D), each describing an experiment and a predicted phenomenon. I need to figure out which of these predictions are correct based on my knowledge of chemistry. Let me go through each one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: Adding NaOH solution to MgCl2 solution until excess. The predicted phenomenon is that a white precipitate forms and then disappears. Hmm, I remember that when you mix solutions of magnesium chloride and sodium hydroxide, a double displacement reaction occurs. The products would be magnesium hydroxide and sodium chloride. Magnesium hydroxide is not very soluble in water, so it should form a white precipitate. But what happens when you add excess NaOH? I think magnesium hydroxide isn't amphoteric like aluminum hydroxide. Aluminum hydroxide dissolves in excess NaOH because it's amphoteric, but magnesium hydroxide... I think it doesn't dissolve. So maybe the precipitate stays. Therefore, the prediction in A is wrong because the precipitate shouldn't disappear. So A is incorrect. So maybe option A is not a correct answer.\n\nMoving on to Option B: Adding KSCN solution to FeCl2 solution. The predicted phenomenon is that the solution turns blood red. Wait, I remember that the blood red color is associated with the Fe(SCN)^3+ complex ion, which forms when Fe^3+ reacts with SCN^- ions. But FeCl2 contains Fe^2+ ions, not Fe^3+. So adding KSCN to FeCl2 shouldn't produce the blood red color immediately. However, maybe there's some oxidation happening? If the solution is not completely pure or if there's some air exposure, Fe^2+ can be oxidized to Fe^3+ over time. But under normal experimental conditions, adding KSCN directly to FeCl2 solution would not immediately turn blood red. Instead, if you first oxidize Fe^2+ to Fe^3+ (for example, by adding H2O2 or something), then adding KSCN would give the blood red color. Therefore, the prediction for B is incorrect. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: Adding NaCl solution to AgI suspension until excess. The predicted phenomenon is that the yellow precipitate completely converts to white precipitate. Let me think. AgI is a yellow precipitate. When you add NaCl, which provides Cl^- ions, there might be some precipitation or dissolution depending on solubility products. The solubility product (Ksp) of AgCl is higher than that of AgI. Wait, no, actually, lower Ksp means less soluble. AgI has a much lower Ksp than AgCl. So if you have AgI precipitate and add Cl^- ions, would AgCl precipitate out? Or would it replace? Since AgCl is more soluble than AgI, perhaps some AgI can be converted to AgCl if there's enough Cl^- ions. Because the Ksp of AgI is about 8.3×10^-17, and AgCl is about 1.8×10^-10. So AgCl is more soluble, but adding excess NaCl might cause some AgI to dissolve and form AgCl? Wait, but AgI is less soluble. Let me think about the reaction. The idea is that if you add Cl^- to AgI, maybe AgI will precipitate AgCl instead. The reaction would be AgI (s) + Cl^- (aq) → AgCl (s) + I^- (aq). For this to happen, the Ksp of AgCl must be higher than AgI, which it is. Let me check the solubility products. Since Ksp for AgI is lower than AgCl, that means that AgI is less soluble. Therefore, if you have AgI precipitate and add Cl^- ions, the AgI might dissolve a bit and form AgCl? Wait, no. Because AgI is less soluble, so if you add Cl^- ions, maybe AgCl will precipitate along with AgI? But since AgI is already present, perhaps the excess Cl^- can cause AgI to convert to AgCl. Let me think in terms of the solubility product. Suppose we have AgI in suspension. The concentration of Ag+ in solution is determined by the Ksp of AgI: [Ag+][I-] = Ksp AgI. If we add Cl^- ions, then Ag+ will react with Cl^- to form AgCl. As Ag+ is consumed to form AgCl, the equilibrium of AgI will shift to the right (Le Chatelier's principle), causing more AgI to dissolve. If enough Cl^- is added, perhaps all the AgI can be converted into AgCl. Since AgCl is white precipitate, the yellow AgI would turn into white AgCl. Therefore, the prediction in C is correct? But wait, is the Ksp of AgCl high enough for this to happen? Let me check approximate values. Ksp of AgCl is 1.8×10^-10 and AgI is 8.3×10^-17. So if you have [Cl^-] high enough, then the reaction can proceed. Let me calculate the minimum [Cl^-] needed for AgI to convert to AgCl. Let me suppose that [Ag+] from AgI is Ksp_AgI / [I^-]. But if we add Cl^-, then [Ag+] is also governed by Ksp_AgCl = [Ag+][Cl^-]. So setting them equal: [Ag+] = Ksp_AgI / [I^-] = Ksp_AgCl / [Cl^-]. Therefore, rearranged, [Cl^-] / [I^-] = Ksp_AgCl / Ksp_AgI. Plugging in numbers, that ratio is (1.8×10^-10) / (8.3×10^-17) ≈ 2.17×10^6. So [Cl^-] needs to be about 2 million times higher than [I^-]. That's a very high concentration. But the question says \"adding NaCl solution until excess\". If we have a suspension of AgI, adding excess NaCl would increase [Cl^-] to a very high level, possibly enough to cause AgI to dissolve and form AgCl. Therefore, the yellow precipitate (AgI) would convert to white AgCl. So the prediction in C is correct? But wait, in reality, would this conversion actually happen? I remember that in lab experiments, when you have a precipitate of AgI and add excess Cl^- (from NaCl), the AgI doesn't really dissolve or convert. Because even though the Ksp is lower for AgI, the required concentration of Cl^- might be impractical. For example, if the original [I^-] is say 1 M (hypothetically), then [Cl^-] would need to be 2e6 M, which is impossible. But in reality, the concentration of I^- in solution is very low because AgI is so insoluble. Let me think again. Suppose that the concentration of I^- in solution is sqrt(Ksp_AgI) if it's saturated, but actually, in a suspension, the [I^-] would be very low. Let me suppose that [Ag+] is determined by the solubility of AgI. If we add Cl^-, then [Ag+] would decrease because AgCl precipitates. So for the reaction AgI + Cl^- → AgCl + I^-, the equilibrium constant K would be [AgCl][I^-]/([AgI][Cl^-])... Wait, maybe better to think in terms of the ratio of Ksp. The reaction is AgI(s) + Cl^-(aq) → AgCl(s) + I^-(aq). The equilibrium constant K for this reaction is [I^-] / [Cl^-] = (Ksp_AgI) / (Ksp_AgCl). So K = (8.3×10^-17) / (1.8×10^-10) ≈ 4.6×10^-7. Since K is very small, this suggests that the reaction favors the reactants. In other words, the reaction does not proceed to a significant extent. Therefore, adding Cl^- to AgI would not result in significant conversion to AgCl. Therefore, the prediction in option C is incorrect. The yellow precipitate would not convert to white. So C is wrong. Therefore, my initial thought was incorrect. I need to be careful here. So the answer for C is incorrect.\n\nNow moving to Option D: Adding ethanol until excess to acidic KMnO4 solution. The predicted phenomenon is that the solution's purple-red color fades. Let me recall. Potassium permanganate in acidic solution is a strong oxidizing agent. Ethanol is a reducing agent. So when ethanol is added to acidic KMnO4, a redox reaction occurs. The MnO4^- ion is reduced from Mn^7+ to Mn^2+ in acidic conditions, which is colorless. Ethanol is oxidized, perhaps to acetic acid or something. The purple color of KMnO4 would fade as it is consumed in the reaction. Therefore, adding ethanol to acidic KMnO4 solution would cause the purple color to fade. So the prediction in D is correct. Therefore, D is a correct option.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nA: Incorrect, because Mg(OH)2 doesn't dissolve in excess NaOH.\n\nB: Incorrect, because FeCl2 has Fe^2+ which doesn't form blood red with SCN^- unless oxidized.\n\nC: Incorrect, because AgI doesn't convert to AgCl with NaCl due to Ksp considerations.\n\nD: Correct, because ethanol reduces MnO4^- in acidic solution, causing decolorization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, which is option D. So the answer should be option D, which is labeled as (D)D in the options given.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For option D, is there a possibility that ethanol doesn't react with acidic KMnO4? No, ethanol is a common reducing agent. For example, in breathalyzer tests, ethanol is oxidized by KMnO4. So yes, the purple color should fade. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
