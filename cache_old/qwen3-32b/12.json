The question is asking which of the given options could explain why the scale reading is less than his usual weight. The options are A through D, each describing different elevator motions. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens to the scale reading in different elevator situations. The scale measures the normal force, which is what we perceive as our weight. Normally, when the elevator is at rest or moving at a constant velocity, the scale reads the person's actual weight because the normal force equals the gravitational force (mg). But when the elevator accelerates, the normal force changes.\n\nSo, if the elevator is accelerating upward, the normal force (and thus the scale reading) increases. Conversely, if the elevator is accelerating downward, the normal force decreases. This is because the net force on the person is the difference between the normal force and the gravitational force. When accelerating upward, the normal force must be greater than mg to provide the upward acceleration. When accelerating downward, the normal force is less than mg because the net force is downward.\n\nNow, the problem states that the scale reading is less than his usual weight. That means the normal force is less than mg. So, this would happen if the elevator is accelerating downward. But acceleration downward can occur in two scenarios: either the elevator is speeding up while moving downward or slowing down while moving upward. Wait, let me think. Acceleration is a vector, so direction matters. If the elevator is moving upward but slowing down, that means the acceleration is downward (opposite to the direction of motion). Similarly, if the elevator is moving downward and speeding up, the acceleration is also downward. Either way, the acceleration is downward, which reduces the normal force.\n\nSo, if the elevator is moving upward and slowing down (option B), that would result in a downward acceleration, causing the scale to read less. Similarly, if the elevator is moving downward and speeding up (which is not one of the options here), that would also cause a lower scale reading. However, looking at the options given, option B is moving upward and slowing down. The other options are A: moving downward and slowing down, C: moving upward at constant speed, D: moving downward at constant speed.\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nA: Moving downward and slowing down. If the elevator is moving downward but slowing down, that means the acceleration is upward (opposite to the direction of motion). So, upward acceleration would increase the normal force, making the scale read more than usual. But the problem says the scale reading is less, so A is not correct.\n\nB: Moving upward and slowing down. As discussed, this would be a downward acceleration. So the normal force is less, which matches the problem's description. So B is a possible answer.\n\nC: Moving upward at constant speed. If the elevator is moving at constant speed, there's no acceleration. The normal force equals mg, so the scale reads normal weight. So C is not correct.\n\nD: Moving downward at constant speed. Similarly, constant speed means no acceleration. Normal force equals mg, so scale reads normal weight. So D is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any directions.\n\nWhen an elevator is moving upward and slowing down, the acceleration is downward. So the net force is downward. The net force is equal to mg - N (where N is the normal force). So if the acceleration is downward, then mg - N = ma. Therefore, N = mg - ma = m(g - a). Since a is positive downward, N is less than mg. That matches the situation where the scale reads less. So yes, B is correct.\n\nOption A is moving downward and slowing down. If it's moving downward but slowing down, the acceleration is upward. So N - mg = ma, so N = m(g + a), which is greater than mg. Hence, the scale would read more, not less. So A is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer is B. Let me check if there are any other possibilities. The question says \"could possibly describe,\" so maybe there are multiple answers? But according to the options given, only B fits. The other options either involve no acceleration (C and D) or upward acceleration (A), which would not result in a lower scale reading. Therefore, B is the correct answer.\n</think>"}
