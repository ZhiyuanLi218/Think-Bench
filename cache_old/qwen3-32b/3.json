The question is about 2-phenylpropene. I need to figure out which of the options A to D are correct. Let me start by recalling what 2-phenylpropene is.\n\nFirst, propene is CH₂=CH-CH₃. Adding a phenyl group (C₆H₅-) to the second carbon would make it 2-phenylpropene. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C₆H₅. Wait, no, the phenyl is attached to the second carbon of the propene chain. So the actual structure is CH₂=C(CH₃)-C₆H₅? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH₂=CH₂-CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH₂=CHCH3. The central carbon is the second one. So attaching the phenyl group to the second carbon. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C6H5. Wait, but the second carbon in propene is the middle one. So the correct structure is CH₂=C(CH2Ph)? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nPropene is CH₂=CH-CH3. The second carbon is the middle one. So 2-phenylpropene would have a phenyl group attached to the second carbon. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C6H5. Wait, that would make the structure CH₂=CH-C6H5. But that would be 1-phenylpropene if the phenyl is on the first carbon. Wait, no. Let me get this right. The numbering in propene is such that the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH3. So the second carbon is the one in the middle. If the phenyl is attached to the second carbon, then the structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)-CH3? Wait, but that would be 2-phenylpropene. Wait, but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)-CH3? No, wait, if the phenyl is on the second carbon, then it's CH₂-CH(C6H5)=CH2? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to draw it out mentally. The IUPAC name for 2-phenylpropene would be based on the propene backbone. So propene is CH₂=CHCH3. The second carbon is the middle one. If a phenyl group is attached to the second carbon, then the structure would be CH₂=C(CH2Ph)CH3? Wait, but that would be 2-phenylpropane, but with a double bond. Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct structure for 2-phenylpropene is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. Wait, that's possible. So the molecule is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. But then the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the phenyl group is on carbon 2. Wait, but carbon 2 is the middle carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)-CH3. But that would make the molecule have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, with a phenyl group attached to carbon 2. So the structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. Alternatively, maybe the phenyl is attached to carbon 1? No, the name says 2-phenyl. So it's on carbon 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is CH₂=CH-C6H5. Wait, that would be 1-phenylpropene. Because the phenyl is on carbon 1. But the name is 2-phenylpropene. So the phenyl must be on carbon 2. Therefore, the correct structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. Wait, but that would be 2-phenylpropane-1-ene? Hmm, maybe I need to check the correct IUPAC name. Let me think. For alkenes, the numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond. So if the phenyl is on carbon 2, then the structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. But in that case, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the phenyl is on carbon 2. So the correct name would be 2-phenylprop-1-ene. But maybe it's called 2-phenylpropene for short. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is CH₂=CH-C6H5. Let me check. If the phenyl is on carbon 1, then it's 1-phenylpropene, which is CH₂=CH-C6H5. If it's on carbon 2, then it's CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. But maybe there's another way to name it. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. Let me confirm. For example, if the molecule is CH₂=CH-C6H5, then the phenyl is on the terminal carbon, so it's 1-phenylpropene. If the phenyl is on the middle carbon, then it's 2-phenylpropene. So the correct structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. So the molecule has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and a phenyl group on carbon 2. So the structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. \n\nNow, moving on to the options. Let's analyze each one.\n\nOption A: Cannot decolorize dilute potassium permanganate solution. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in dilute solution is an oxidizing agent. For alkenes, KMnO4 can oxidize the double bond. If the alkene is in acidic conditions, it would undergo cleavage. But in dilute solution, maybe it's under basic or neutral conditions? Wait, in dilute and cold KMnO4, maybe it's a milder oxidation. For example, in basic conditions, alkenes can be oxidized to diols. However, if the alkene is conjugated with a benzene ring, maybe the reaction is different. Wait, 2-phenylpropene has a double bond adjacent to a phenyl group. So the structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. The double bond is between the first and second carbon, with the phenyl on the second carbon. So the molecule is an allyl phenyl compound. \n\nIn the case of KMnO4, if the alkene can be oxidized, then the solution would decolorize. So if the compound can react with KMnO4, it would decolorize the solution. So option A says it cannot decolorize, which would mean the compound does not react. But alkenes generally can react with KMnO4. Unless there's some steric hindrance or other factors. However, given that the phenyl group is on the double bond, maybe the oxidation is possible. For example, in the case of styrene (which is phenylethene, CH₂=CH-C6H5), which is similar to 2-phenylpropene but with one less CH3 group. Styrene can be oxidized by KMnO4. So if 2-phenylpropene can be oxidized, then option A is incorrect. Therefore, option A is incorrect. So A is not correct. So the correct answer would not include A.\n\nOption B: Can undergo addition polymerization reaction. Alkenes generally can undergo addition polymerization. The presence of a phenyl group might not prevent it. For example, styrene (phenylethene) can polymerize into polystyrene. Similarly, 2-phenylpropene should be able to undergo addition polymerization. So option B is correct. \n\nOption C: All atoms in the molecule are coplanar. Let's think about the structure. The molecule is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The phenyl group is attached to C2. In alkenes, the double bond is planar, with each carbon in the double bond being sp² hybridized. The substituents on the double bond are in the same plane. However, the phenyl group is attached to the double bond. The benzene ring is planar. However, the angle between the double bond and the benzene ring. In this case, the phenyl group is attached to the double bond. The carbon to which the phenyl is attached (C2) is part of the double bond. So the phenyl group is attached to a sp² hybridized carbon. The benzene ring is planar, but the angle between the double bond and the phenyl ring. In such cases, the molecule may have some torsion. However, in conjugated systems, sometimes the rings are coplanar. Wait, but here the phenyl is attached to a carbon that is part of the double bond. Let me visualize the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C2 has a phenyl group. The structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. The CH3 is on C3. The phenyl is on C2. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The phenyl ring is attached to C2. The geometry around the double bond is trigonal planar. So the phenyl ring is attached to a carbon that is in a planar structure. However, the phenyl ring itself is planar, but whether it lies in the same plane as the double bond? In reality, the angle between the phenyl ring and the double bond is determined by the possibility of conjugation. Since the phenyl is attached to a carbon with a double bond, there could be conjugation. However, for conjugation to occur, the p-orbitals need to be aligned. In this case, the phenyl ring is attached to a carbon that is part of the double bond, so the p-orbitals of the phenyl ring could conjugate with the double bond. However, that would require the phenyl ring to be in the same plane as the double bond. Therefore, the entire molecule may be planar. But wait, the CH3 group on C3 is a methyl group. The presence of the methyl group might cause some strain if the molecule were to be planar. Let me think. The structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The C2 is connected to the phenyl and also to the C3 (CH3). The geometry around C2 is trigonal planar. The phenyl group is in the same plane as the double bond, and the CH3 is in the same plane? But a methyl group is not planar. However, the molecule's planarity is about the atoms. The question is whether all atoms are coplanar. The benzene ring has all atoms in its own plane. The double bond is in another plane. If these planes are coplanar, then all atoms would be in the same plane. However, in reality, the angle between the phenyl ring and the double bond may not be 0 degrees. For example, in styrene (phenylethene), the molecule is not completely planar. The phenyl ring and the ethylene group are at an angle, but due to conjugation, there's some partial planarity. However, not all atoms are coplanar. In styrene, the molecule is not completely planar. The same would apply here. The presence of the methyl group on C3 would prevent the entire molecule from being coplanar. Therefore, option C is incorrect. So not all atoms are coplanar. Therefore, option C is wrong.\n\nOption D: Easily soluble in water and toluene. Solubility in water depends on the polarity. Alkenes are generally nonpolar, so they are not soluble in water. The phenyl group is also nonpolar. So 2-phenylpropene is a nonpolar molecule. Therefore, it should be insoluble in water. Toluene is a nonpolar solvent, so the compound would be soluble in toluene. Therefore, option D says it is easily soluble in both water and toluene. Since it's not soluble in water, D is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Option D says \"easily soluble in water and toluene\". Since it's not soluble in water, D is incorrect. Therefore, only option B is correct. But let me check again.\n\nOption B: Can undergo addition polymerization. Yes, as alkenes can polymerize. The presence of the phenyl group may not hinder the polymerization. For example, polystyrene is the polymer of styrene (phenylethene). Similarly, 2-phenylpropene would have a similar structure but with an extra CH3 group. So it should polymerize via addition. So B is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. Let me check the options again. The options are (A) Cannot decolorize... (B) Can undergo... (C) All atoms coplanar... (D) Easily soluble in water and toluene. So only B is correct. But wait, maybe I made a mistake with option C. Let me think again. The molecule is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. The double bond is planar. The phenyl group is attached to the double bond. The phenyl ring is planar. However, the angle between the phenyl ring and the rest of the molecule. In reality, in such molecules, the phenyl ring can rotate around the single bond connecting it to the double bond? Wait, no. The phenyl is attached to a carbon in the double bond. The carbon in the double bond is sp² hybridized. The bond between the phenyl and the double bond is a single bond. Wait, no. The phenyl is attached to the carbon of the double bond. So the carbon in the double bond is connected to the phenyl group. The bond between the phenyl and the double bond carbon is a single bond. Wait, no. The phenyl is attached to the carbon that is part of the double bond. For example, in CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3, the phenyl is attached to the C2 (the middle carbon of the propene). The C2 is part of the double bond (C1=C2). Therefore, the bond between C2 and the phenyl is a single bond. Wait, no. The structure is CH₂=C(C6H5)CH3. The C2 is connected to the phenyl via a single bond? No, the phenyl is directly attached to the C2. Since C2 is part of the double bond, the bond between C2 and the phenyl is a single bond. Therefore, there is a single bond between the sp² hybridized carbon (C2) and the phenyl ring. Wait, but the phenyl ring is attached to a carbon that is part of a double bond. The bond between the phenyl and the C2 is a single bond. So the phenyl ring can rotate around that single bond? No, because the C2 is part of a double bond. The geometry around C2 is trigonal planar. The bond between C2 and the phenyl is in the same plane as the double bond. However, the phenyl ring itself is planar. Therefore, if the phenyl ring is in the same plane as the double bond, then the entire molecule's atoms would be coplanar except for the methyl group. Wait, the methyl group is on C3. The C3 is attached to C2. The geometry around C2 is trigonal planar. The C3 is attached to C2. So the bond between C2 and C3 is in the same plane as the double bond. But the methyl group is a CH3 group. The CH3 is attached to C3. The geometry around C3 is tetrahedral. Therefore, the methyl group's hydrogen atoms are not coplanar with the rest of the molecule. Therefore, not all atoms are coplanar. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n</think>"}
