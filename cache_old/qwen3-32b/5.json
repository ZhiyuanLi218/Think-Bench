I need to simplify this expression: the square root of (2.5 squared minus 0.7 squared) divided by (2.7 minus 2.5). Hmm, let me write that down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me handle the numerator. The numerator is √(2.5² - 0.7²). I remember there's a formula for the difference of squares, which is a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here? Let me check. If I let a = 2.5 and b = 0.7, then yes, 2.5² - 0.7² would factor into (2.5 - 0.7)(2.5 + 0.7). Let me calculate those values.\n\nCalculating 2.5 - 0.7: 2.5 minus 0.7 is... 2.5 minus 0.5 is 2.0, and then minus another 0.2 is 1.8. So that part is 1.8. Then 2.5 + 0.7 is 3.2. So multiplying those together, 1.8 * 3.2. Let me do that multiplication. \n\nHmm, 1.8 times 3.2. Maybe I can think of 1.8 as 1 + 0.8. So 1*3.2 = 3.2, and 0.8*3.2. Let me calculate 0.8*3.2. 0.8*3 is 2.4, and 0.8*0.2 is 0.16. Adding those together, 2.4 + 0.16 = 2.56. So adding that to the previous 3.2, total is 3.2 + 2.56 = 5.76. So the numerator inside the square root is 5.76. Therefore, the square root of 5.76. \n\nWhat's the square root of 5.76? Hmm, I know that 2.4 squared is 5.76 because 2.4*2.4: 2*2 is 4, 2*0.4 is 0.8, 0.4*2 is 0.8, and 0.4*0.4 is 0.16. Adding them up: 4 + 0.8 + 0.8 + 0.16 = 5.76. So √5.76 is 2.4. So the numerator simplifies to 2.4.\n\nNow the denominator is 2.7 - 2.5. That's straightforward. 2.7 minus 2.5 is 0.2. So now the entire expression simplifies to 2.4 divided by 0.2. \n\nDividing 2.4 by 0.2. Hmm, dividing by 0.2 is the same as multiplying by 5, because 0.2 is 1/5. So 2.4 * 5. Let me calculate that. 2 * 5 is 10, and 0.4 * 5 is 2. So 10 + 2 = 12. Therefore, 2.4 divided by 0.2 is 12. \n\nWait, let me verify that again. 0.2 times 12 is 2.4, right? 0.2*10=2.0, 0.2*2=0.4, so 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4. Yep, that checks out. So the entire expression simplifies to 12. \n\nBut let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the numerator:\n\n√(2.5² - 0.7²). Calculated 2.5² is 6.25, and 0.7² is 0.49. Then 6.25 - 0.49 is 5.76. Square root of 5.76 is 2.4. Then denominator 2.7 - 2.5 is 0.2. 2.4 divided by 0.2 is 12. Yep, same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it without factoring. Let me try that way as a check. Let me compute 2.5 squared first. 2.5 squared is 6.25. 0.7 squared is 0.49. Subtract them: 6.25 - 0.49. Let me do that subtraction. 6.25 minus 0.49. 6.25 - 0.45 is 5.80, then subtract another 0.04 to get 5.76. Same as before. Then square root is 2.4. Divided by 0.2 is 12. So same answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way? Let me think. If I didn't factor the difference of squares, but just did straight calculation. Still ends up same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe convert decimals to fractions? Let me try that approach. \n\nFirst, 2.5 is equal to 5/2. 0.7 is 7/10. 2.7 is 27/10, and 2.5 is 5/2. Let me write all terms as fractions.\n\nSo numerator is √[( (5/2)^2 - (7/10)^2 )]. Denominator is (27/10 - 5/2). Let me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, denominator: 27/10 - 5/2. To subtract, find common denominator. 2 is 10. So 5/2 is 25/10. Therefore, 27/10 - 25/10 = 2/10 = 1/5. So denominator is 1/5.\n\nNumerator: √[ (25/4 - 49/100) ]. Let me compute 25/4 - 49/100. Convert to common denominator. 25/4 is 625/100. 625/100 - 49/100 = 576/100. Therefore, square root of 576/100 is √(576)/√(100) = 24/10 = 12/5. \n\nSo numerator is 12/5, denominator is 1/5. Dividing 12/5 by 1/5 is (12/5) * (5/1) = 12. Same result. \n\nSo regardless of the method, decimal or fractions, I get 12. Therefore, the simplified value is 12. \n\nBut let me check once more with decimal calculations to be absolutely sure. \n\nNumerator: 2.5 squared is 6.25. 0.7 squared is 0.49. 6.25 - 0.49 is 5.76. Square root of 5.76 is 2.4. Denominator: 2.7 - 2.5 is 0.2. 2.4 divided by 0.2. Move decimal one place: 24 divided by 2 is 12. Yep. \n\nAlternatively, think of units. 0.2 is 2 tenths. 2.4 is 24 tenths. Dividing 24 tenths by 2 tenths is 12. \n\nAll methods confirm that the answer is 12. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Therefore, I think the simplified result is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified value is \\boxed{12}.\n</think>"}
