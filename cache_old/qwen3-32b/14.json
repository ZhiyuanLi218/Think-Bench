The table gives percentages for each grade, and there are 300 males and 300 females surveyed in each grade. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. For each grade, I need to calculate the number of male bus riders and the number of female bus riders. Then, I need to see how close the male number is to 135% of the female number. The grade where this difference is the smallest is the answer.\n\nSo, for each grade, the number of male bus riders is the percentage given multiplied by 300. Similarly, the number of female bus riders is their percentage multiplied by 300. Then, 135% of the female bus riders would be 1.35 times the number of female bus riders. I need to compare the actual male bus riders to this 1.35 times female number and see which grade has the closest value.\n\nLet me write down the formula for each grade:\n\nFor a given grade, let M% be the male percentage and F% be the female percentage.\n\nNumber of male bus riders = (M% / 100) * 300\n\nNumber of female bus riders = (F% / 100) * 300\n\n135% of female bus riders = 1.35 * [(F% / 100) * 300]\n\nWe need to find the grade where |(Male riders) - 1.35*(Female riders)| is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, since both numbers are based on 300 students, maybe there's a way to simplify this without calculating the actual numbers? Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nMale riders = (M% * 3) because 300 is 100% so 1% is 3 students. Similarly, Female riders = (F% * 3). Therefore, 135% of female riders is 1.35 * (F% * 3).\n\nSo, Male riders = 3*M%, and 1.35*Female riders = 1.35*3*F% = 4.05*F%.\n\nTherefore, we can compare 3*M% vs 4.05*F%, and find which grade has these two numbers closest.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the ratio (Male riders)/(Female riders) and see how close it is to 1.35. Since 135% is 1.35. So if we take Male / Female ≈ 1.35?\n\nBut since Male riders = 3*M% and Female riders = 3*F%, the ratio is (3*M%)/(3*F%) = M% / F%. Therefore, the ratio simplifies to M% / F%. So we need M% / F% ≈ 1.35. Therefore, for each grade, compute M% divided by F%, see which one is closest to 1.35.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. Because the question says the number of male riders is closest to 135% of female riders. So:\n\nNumber of male riders ≈ 1.35 * number of female riders.\n\nTherefore, (Number of male riders) / (Number of female riders) ≈ 1.35.\n\nBut since Number of male riders is (M% * 3), and number of female riders is (F% * 3), their ratio is indeed M% / F%. Therefore, the ratio of percentages is equal to the ratio of actual numbers. Therefore, we can just compute M% divided by F% for each grade and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nThat seems like a simpler approach. Let me verify with an example. Let's take 9th grade:\n\nM% = 41.1%, F% = 39.4%. So ratio is 41.1 / 39.4 ≈ 1.043. Which is way less than 1.35. So that's not close. Similarly, if I calculate the actual numbers:\n\nMale riders: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 = 123.3\n\nFemale riders: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300 = 118.2\n\nThen 1.35 * female riders = 1.35 * 118.2 ≈ 159.57\n\nSo male riders (123.3) vs 159.57. The difference is about 36.27. Which is quite big.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute the ratio 123.3 / 118.2 ≈ 1.043, which is the same as 41.1 / 39.4. So both methods agree.\n\nTherefore, since the ratio of percentages is same as ratio of actual numbers, we can just compute M% / F% for each grade and see which is closest to 1.35. Let me do that for all grades.\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n\nGrade 9: M% / F% = 41.1 / 39.4 ≈ Let me calculate that. 41.1 divided by 39.4. Let me do decimal division.\n\nWell, 39.4 goes into 41.1 once, with remainder 1.7. So approx 1.043 as before.\n\nGrade 10: 34.4 / 33.1. Let me calculate. 33.1 goes into 34.4 once, remainder 1.3. So approx 1.039.\n\nGrade 11: 20.6 / 13.8. Let me compute that. 13.8 goes into 20.6 once, with 6.8 remaining. 6.8 / 13.8 ≈ 0.492. So total approx 1.492.\n\nGrade 12: 11.6 / 8.6. Let me calculate. 8.6 goes into 11.6 once, remainder 3. 3 / 8.6 ≈ 0.348. Total approx 1.348.\n\nSo now, we have the ratios:\n\nGrade 9: ~1.043\n\nGrade 10: ~1.039\n\nGrade 11: ~1.492\n\nGrade 12: ~1.348\n\nWe need to see which of these is closest to 1.35.\n\nSo let's compute the absolute difference between each ratio and 1.35.\n\nFor Grade 9: |1.043 - 1.35| = 0.307\n\nGrade 10: |1.039 - 1.35| ≈ 0.311\n\nGrade 11: |1.492 - 1.35| = 0.142\n\nGrade 12: |1.348 - 1.35| ≈ 0.002\n\nWait, that seems like Grade 12 is extremely close. But let me check my calculations again because 1.348 is 1.35 - 0.002? Wait, 1.348 is 0.002 less than 1.35. So the absolute difference is 0.002. That seems really small. Let me verify the Grade 12 ratio.\n\nGrade 12: Male percentage is 11.6%, female is 8.6%. So 11.6 divided by 8.6. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nFirst, 8.6 × 1.35 = ?\n\nWell 8.6 × 1.35. Let's compute 8 × 1.35 = 10.8, 0.6 × 1.35 = 0.81, so total 10.8 + 0.81 = 11.61. So 8.6 × 1.35 = 11.61. Therefore, 11.6 / 8.6 = 1.35 / (11.61 / 11.6). Wait, no. Wait:\n\nWait, if 8.6 × 1.35 = 11.61, then if we have 11.6 / 8.6 = x, then x = 11.6 / 8.6 ≈ ?\n\nBut 11.6 / 8.6 = (approx) Let me compute 8.6 × 1.348 ≈ ?\n\nWell, 8.6 × 1.3 = 11.18\n\n8.6 × 0.048 = let's compute 8.6 × 0.04 = 0.344, 8.6 × 0.008 = 0.0688. So total 0.344 + 0.0688 = 0.4128. Therefore, total 11.18 + 0.4128 ≈ 11.5928. Which is very close to 11.6. Therefore, 8.6 × 1.348 ≈ 11.5928 ≈ 11.6. Therefore, 11.6 / 8.6 ≈ 1.348. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 1.348, which is 0.002 less than 1.35. Therefore, the difference is indeed about 0.002. So Grade 12 is extremely close.\n\nGrade 11 had a ratio of ~1.492, difference |1.492 - 1.35| = 0.142.\n\nGrade 10: ~0.311, Grade 9: ~0.307. So Grade 12 is closest. But let me check if I did the Grade 11 calculation correctly. Grade 11 male percentage is 20.6, female is 13.8. 20.6 / 13.8. Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 13.8 × 1.4 = 19.32. 13.8 × 1.5 = 20.7. Our numerator is 20.6, which is just slightly less than 1.5 times 13.8. Let me calculate:\n\n1.5 × 13.8 = 20.7. Therefore, 20.6 is 20.7 - 0.1. Therefore, 20.6 / 13.8 = 1.5 - (0.1 / 13.8) ≈ 1.5 - 0.0072 ≈ 1.4928. Which is approximately 1.4928. Therefore, the difference from 1.35 is 1.4928 - 1.35 = 0.1428. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, Grade 12 is the closest with a difference of ~0.002. But let me check if there's a mistake here. The problem says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\". So maybe I need to check if the actual numbers differ by a small amount, not just the ratio? Because maybe in Grade 12, even though the ratio is very close to 1.35, the actual numbers could differ by more due to rounding? Let me check.\n\nLet me compute the actual numbers for Grade 12:\n\nMale bus riders: 11.6% of 300. Let's calculate that. 10% of 300 is 30, 1.6% is 4.8, so total 30 + 4.8 = 34.8. So 34.8 male riders.\n\nFemale bus riders: 8.6% of 300. 10% is 30, minus 1.4% which is 4.2, so 30 - 4.2 = 25.8 female riders.\n\nNow, 135% of female riders is 1.35 * 25.8. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1 * 25.8 = 25.8\n\n0.3 * 25.8 = 7.74\n\n0.05 * 25.8 = 1.29\n\nAdding up: 25.8 + 7.74 = 33.54 + 1.29 = 34.83.\n\nSo 1.35 * female riders is 34.83. The actual male riders is 34.8. The difference is 34.83 - 34.8 = 0.03. So only 0.03 difference. Which is very small. So in actual numbers, it's almost the same. So Grade 12 is indeed very close.\n\nBut let me check another grade just to make sure. Let's check Grade 11. Maybe there is a grade where the difference in actual numbers is smaller?\n\nGrade 11:\n\nMale riders: 20.6% of 300. Let's calculate. 20% is 60, 0.6% is 1.8, so total 61.8.\n\nFemale riders: 13.8% of 300. 10% is 30, 3% is 9, 0.8% is 2.4. Total 30 + 9 + 2.4 = 41.4.\n\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 41.4. Let's calculate:\n\n1 * 41.4 = 41.4\n\n0.3 * 41.4 = 12.42\n\n0.05 * 41.4 = 2.07\n\nAdding up: 41.4 + 12.42 = 53.82 + 2.07 = 55.89.\n\nMale riders: 61.8. Difference is 61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91. Which is much bigger than 0.03. So Grade 12 is better.\n\nGrade 10:\n\nMale riders: 34.4% of 300. 30% is 90, 4.4% is 13.2, total 103.2.\n\nFemale riders: 33.1% of 300. 30% is 90, 3.1% is 9.3, total 99.3.\n\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 99.3.\n\nLet me compute that. 1 * 99.3 = 99.3, 0.3 * 99.3 = 29.79, 0.05 * 99.3 = 4.965. Total: 99.3 + 29.79 = 129.09 + 4.965 ≈ 134.055.\n\nMale riders: 103.2. Difference is |103.2 - 134.055| ≈ 30.855. Which is way bigger.\n\nGrade 9:\n\nMale riders: 41.1% of 300. 40% is 120, 1.1% is 3.3, total 123.3.\n\nFemale riders: 39.4% of 300. 39% is 117, 0.4% is 1.2, total 118.2.\n\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 118.2 ≈ Let me calculate:\n\nAs before, 1.35 * 118.2. Let me do 1.35 * 100 = 135, 1.35 * 18.2 = ?\n\n1.35 * 18 = 24.3, 1.35 * 0.2 = 0.27. Total 24.3 + 0.27 = 24.57. So total 135 + 24.57 = 159.57.\n\nMale riders: 123.3. Difference is 159.57 - 123.3 = 36.27. Which is even bigger.\n\nTherefore, clearly Grade 12 is the closest. The difference in actual numbers is only 0.03, which is practically negligible. So Grade 12 is the answer. But let me check if there's any possible mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\". Since the numbers are in percentages, and the actual numbers are 34.8 vs 34.83. But since you can't have 0.03 of a person, but the question is about the numbers, which could be decimal because it's based on percentages. Since the survey is based on 300 students, the percentages might not result in whole numbers. However, when the question says \"the number of its male bus riders\", it's referring to the actual count, which would be a decimal here because we're using percentages. But in reality, you can't have a fraction of a person, but since the problem gives percentages, we have to assume that these are exact values, perhaps from the survey data, which might have been rounded. However, for the purpose of the problem, we take the percentages as exact and compute accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12th grade. However, let me check once again if I didn't make a calculation mistake with Grade 12's ratio.\n\nMale percentage 11.6, female 8.6. 11.6 / 8.6. Let me do this division more carefully.\n\nDividing 11.6 by 8.6:\n\nFirst, note that 8.6 × 1.3 = 11.18\n\nSubtract that from 11.6: 11.6 - 11.18 = 0.42\n\nNow, bring down a zero (assuming decimal division): 0.420\n\n8.6 goes into 4.20 how many times? Well, 8.6 × 0.04 = 0.344\n\nSubtract that from 4.20: 4.20 - 0.344 = 3.856\n\nBring down another zero: 38.56\n\n8.6 × 0.004 = 0.0344, but this is getting too small. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since we have 0.42 remaining after 1.3, so total so far is 1.3 + 0.42 / 8.6.\n\nCompute 0.42 / 8.6 ≈ 0.0488. Therefore, total ratio ≈ 1.3 + 0.0488 ≈ 1.3488, which is approximately 1.3488, which is 1.3488 vs 1.35. The difference is 1.35 - 1.3488 = 0.0012. So the absolute difference is approximately 0.0012, which is even smaller than I thought earlier. Therefore, the ratio is extremely close to 1.35. Therefore, the answer is 12th grade.\n\nBut let me check if there's another grade where maybe the difference is smaller? For example, maybe Grade 11? But no, as we saw, the difference there was 0.142. So way bigger. Grades 9 and 10 are worse.\n\nAlternatively, is there a possibility that due to rounding in percentages, the actual numbers might be different? For example, the percentages in the table are given to one decimal place, so maybe the actual percentages are slightly different? But the problem states the data in the table, so we have to go with the given percentages.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 12th grade.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check once again:\n\nFor Grade 12:\n\nMale riders: 11.6% of 300 = 34.8\n\nFemale riders: 8.6% of 300 = 25.8\n\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 25.8 = 34.83\n\nDifference: |34.8 - 34.83| = 0.03\n\nWhich is 0.03 students. Since we are dealing with numbers here, not whole people, this is acceptable. So 0.03 is very close.\n\nTherefore, Grade 12 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe grade for which the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders is $\\boxed{12}$.\n</think>"}
