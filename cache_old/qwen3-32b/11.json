Hmm, let me start by recalling what a y-intercept is. From what I remember, intercepts are points where the graph crosses the axes. Specifically, the y-intercept is where the graph crosses the y-axis. But wait, usually we talk about y-intercepts for functions where y is expressed in terms of x, like y = f(x). In this case, though, the equation is given as x in terms of y. So maybe I need to adjust my thinking.\n\nIn the standard Cartesian coordinate system, the y-axis is where x = 0. So, to find the y-intercepts, I need to find the points where x = 0 on the graph of this parabola. That means I should set x equal to zero in the equation and solve for y. Let me write that down:\n\n0 = y² - 4y - 1\n\nSo, solving this quadratic equation for y will give me the y-coordinates of the y-intercepts. The number of real solutions to this equation will correspond to the number of y-intercepts. If there are two real solutions, there are two y-intercepts; if one, then one; if none, then there are no y-intercepts.\n\nAlright, so let me solve 0 = y² - 4y - 1. To solve a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). In this case, the equation is in terms of y, but the formula still applies. Let me identify the coefficients:\n\na = 1 (coefficient of y²)\nb = -4 (coefficient of y)\nc = -1 (constant term)\n\nPlugging these into the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [-(-4) ± √((-4)² - 4*1*(-1))]/(2*1)\nSimplify step by step:\n\nFirst, compute -b: -(-4) = 4\n\nNext, compute the discriminant: b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4*1*(-1) = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\nSo now we have:\n\ny = [4 ± √20]/2\n\nSimplify √20. √20 can be simplified as √(4*5) = √4 * √5 = 2√5. Therefore:\n\ny = [4 ± 2√5]/2\n\nWe can factor out a 2 in the numerator:\n\ny = 2[2 ± √5]/2\n\nCancel the 2:\n\ny = 2 ± √5\n\nSo there are two real solutions: y = 2 + √5 and y = 2 - √5. Therefore, the graph of the parabola x = y² - 4y - 1 crosses the y-axis at two points: (0, 2 + √5) and (0, 2 - √5). \n\nWait a second, let me verify this because sometimes when equations are solved, especially quadratics, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check my discriminant calculation again. The discriminant was b² - 4ac. Here, b is -4, so squared is 16. Then 4ac is 4*1*(-1) which is -4. So discriminant is 16 - (-4) which is 20. That's correct. Then square root of 20 is indeed 2√5. Then dividing by 2 gives 2 ± √5. So that seems right.\n\nTherefore, since we have two real solutions, there are two y-intercepts. But let me think again about what the graph of x = y² - 4y - 1 looks like. This is a parabola that opens either to the right or left because it's a quadratic in y. Since the coefficient of y² is positive (1), it opens to the right. The vertex of this parabola can be found by completing the square or using the formula. Let me try completing the square for better understanding.\n\nStarting with x = y² - 4y - 1.\n\nTo complete the square for the y terms:\n\nTake y² - 4y. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of y, which is -4/2 = -2, square it: (-2)² = 4. So add and subtract 4:\n\nx = (y² - 4y + 4 - 4) - 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = (y - 2)² - 4 - 1\n\nx = (y - 2)² - 5\n\nSo the equation in vertex form is x = (y - 2)² - 5. Therefore, the vertex is at (-5, 2). Since the parabola opens to the right, the vertex is the \"leftmost\" point of the parabola. \n\nNow, knowing that the vertex is at (-5, 2), which is way to the left of the y-axis (which is at x=0), and since it opens to the right, it's going to cross the y-axis at some points. Since we found two solutions for y when x=0, that makes sense because as the parabola opens to the right, it can cross the y-axis twice. \n\nAlternatively, if the vertex was to the right of the y-axis, depending on how \"wide\" the parabola is, it might not cross the y-axis, but in this case, since the vertex is at x=-5, which is far left, crossing the y-axis twice is plausible.\n\nLet me also check with approximate values to see if these y-values make sense. Let me compute 2 + √5 and 2 - √5 numerically. √5 is approximately 2.236. Therefore:\n\n2 + √5 ≈ 2 + 2.236 ≈ 4.236\n\n2 - √5 ≈ 2 - 2.236 ≈ -0.236\n\nTherefore, the two y-intercepts are approximately (0, 4.236) and (0, -0.236). Let me plug these back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, plug in y ≈ 4.236:\n\nx = (4.236)^2 - 4*(4.236) - 1\n\nCompute 4.236 squared. Well, since √5 ≈ 2.236, 2 + √5 ≈ 4.236, and (2 + √5)^2 = 4 + 4√5 + 5 = 9 + 4√5 ≈ 9 + 8.944 ≈ 17.944. Then subtract 4*(2 + √5): 4*2 + 4*√5 ≈ 8 + 8.944 ≈ 16.944. Then subtract 1. So total x ≈ 17.944 - 16.944 - 1 = 0. Correct. Similarly for y ≈ -0.236, which is 2 - √5. Let me compute:\n\n(2 - √5)^2 - 4*(2 - √5) - 1\n\nFirst, (2 - √5)^2 = 4 - 4√5 + 5 = 9 - 4√5 ≈ 9 - 8.944 ≈ 0.056\n\nThen subtract 4*(2 - √5) = 8 - 4√5 ≈ 8 - 8.944 ≈ -0.944\n\nSo total x ≈ 0.056 - (-0.944) - 1 ≈ 0.056 + 0.944 - 1 ≈ 1 - 1 = 0. Correct. Therefore, both solutions check out numerically. \n\nTherefore, there are indeed two y-intercepts. \n\nBut let me think again if there's another way someone might approach this problem and maybe get confused. For example, if someone is used to functions where x is a function of y, but in standard form, we usually have y as a function of x. Since this is a parabola that opens to the right, it's not a function of x (because it fails the vertical line test), but it is a function of y. However, when looking for intercepts, we don't necessarily have to worry about functions; we just have to find where it crosses the axes.\n\nAnother common mistake could be confusing x-intercepts with y-intercepts. For example, if someone tried to set y=0 to find x-intercepts instead of x=0 for y-intercepts. Let me check that. If we set y=0, we get x = 0 - 0 -1 = -1. So the x-intercept is at (-1, 0). But the question is about y-intercepts, so that's a different thing. So as long as I remember that for y-intercepts, x=0, and solve accordingly, I should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that since it's a quadratic, there can only be one y-intercept, but that's not the case. For a standard vertical parabola (opening up or down), which is a function y = ax² + bx + c, there is only one y-intercept, found by setting x=0, which gives y = c. However, in this case, the parabola is horizontal, opening to the right, so it's not a function of x, and it can have multiple y-intercepts. In fact, horizontal parabolas can intersect the y-axis at 0, 1, or 2 points, depending on their position, similar to how vertical parabolas can intersect the x-axis at 0, 1, or 2 points.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since solving x=0 yielded two real solutions, there are two y-intercepts. \n\nAnother way to visualize this is to consider the graph. The vertex is at (-5, 2). Since the parabola opens to the right, as y increases or decreases from 2, x increases. The distance from the vertex to the y-axis (which is at x=0) is 5 units to the right. Since parabolas are symmetric, and given that it's a horizontal parabola, the axis of symmetry is the horizontal line y = 2. Therefore, the parabola will cross the y-axis at two points symmetric with respect to y = 2. The two y-values we found, 2 + √5 and 2 - √5, average to ( (2 + √5) + (2 - √5) ) / 2 = 4/2 = 2, which is indeed the axis of symmetry. Therefore, this also confirms that there are two points of intersection with the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks and reasoning, I can confidently say that the graph of the parabola x = y² - 4y - 1 has two y-intercepts.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe graph of the parabola has \\boxed{2} y-intercepts.\n</think>"}
