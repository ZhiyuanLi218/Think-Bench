The vector potential is given in cylindrical coordinates, with A in the phi direction. Let me try to recall how vector potentials relate to magnetic fields and induced currents.\n\nFirst, I remember that the magnetic field B is the curl of the vector potential A. So, B = ∇ × A. But since A is given in cylindrical coordinates, I need to compute the curl in cylindrical coordinates. The vector potential A is in the phi direction, and its magnitude depends on r (the radial coordinate). Also, A is non-zero only within r < R, and zero outside. Additionally, B increases linearly with time as B = b*t, where b is a constant. Wait, but B here is mentioned in the problem as part of the vector potential expression. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe vector potential A is given as A = B*r/2 in the phi direction for r < R, and A = 0 for r > R. But B here is a time-dependent quantity, B = b*t. So actually, the vector potential is time-dependent because B is time-dependent. Therefore, A(t) = (b*t*r/2) in the phi direction for r < R, and zero otherwise.\n\nNow, the current density induced in the conductor is due to the electromotive force (EMF) caused by the changing magnetic field. But since we have a time-varying vector potential, this can also directly relate to the electric field. I recall that the electric field E can be derived from the vector potential via E = -∂A/∂t - ∇φ, but in the absence of scalar potential (assuming electrostatics?), maybe we can ignore the gradient term? Wait, but if the problem is purely about the vector potential changing with time, then the electric field would be E = -∂A/∂t. Is that right?\n\nYes, in the Coulomb gauge, if there are no charges, then E is given by E = -∂A/∂t. But maybe more generally, in the case of a static scalar potential and time-varying vector potential, the electric field is indeed E = -∂A/∂t - ∇φ. However, if we are considering the case where there are no static electric fields (φ = 0), then E = -∂A/∂t. So perhaps in this problem, we can take E = -∂A/∂t.\n\nSo, let's compute E first. Since A is in the phi direction, and depends on r and t, then ∂A/∂t would be the derivative of A with respect to time. Given that A = (B(t) * r)/2 in the phi direction, and B(t) = b*t, then ∂A/∂t = (b * r)/2 in the phi direction. Therefore, E = -∂A/∂t = - (b * r)/2 in the phi direction. But since we are looking for the magnitude, maybe the direction isn't important here, just the magnitude. So the electric field magnitude is (b*r)/2 in the phi direction for r < R, and zero for r > R. Wait, but hold on. For r > R, A is zero, so ∂A/∂t is zero, so E is zero. So inside r < R, there's an electric field in the phi direction.\n\nNow, the current density J in a conductor is given by Ohm's law, J = σ E, where σ is the conductivity. Therefore, if E is (b*r)/2 in the phi direction for r < R, then J would be σ * b * r / 2 in the phi direction. So for r < R, J = σ b r / 2. But wait, the options given have different expressions for r > R. The question is, what is the current density for r > R? Because in those regions, A is zero, so ∂A/∂t is zero, so E is zero, so J should be zero? But the options don't have zero; they have expressions. Hmm. So maybe my initial reasoning is incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another contribution to the electric field. Because Faraday's Law states that the curl of E is equal to -∂B/∂t. So maybe I need to compute E using Faraday's Law instead of directly from the time derivative of A? Let me check.\n\nFaraday's Law: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. So if I compute B from the given A, then take its time derivative, I can find ∇ × E, and then solve for E. Let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's compute B from A. Given that A is in the phi direction, and depends on r. In cylindrical coordinates, the curl of A (which is B) can be calculated. The formula for curl in cylindrical coordinates when A has only a phi component:\n\n∇ × A has components:\n\n- Radial component: (1/r) * ∂(A_z)/∂φ - ∂A_φ/∂z. But since A_z = 0 and A is independent of z (since the plate is infinite and A is given as depending on r and phi, but not z?), then this component is zero.\n\n- Phi component: ∂A_r/∂z - ∂A_z/∂r. Again, A_r = 0 and A_z = 0, so this is zero.\n\n- z component: (1/r)[ ∂(r A_φ)/∂r - ∂A_r/∂φ ].\n\nSince A_r = 0 and A_φ is given, the z component is:\n\n(1/r) * [ ∂(r A_φ)/∂r ].\n\nGiven that A_φ = (B(t) r)/2 for r < R, then r A_φ = (B(t) r^2)/2. Taking derivative with respect to r:\n\nd/dr [ (B(t) r^2)/2 ] = B(t) r. Then multiply by 1/r: B(t) r / r = B(t). Therefore, B_z = B(t) for r < R. For r > R, A is zero, so B_z would be the derivative of zero, so zero? Wait, but if A is zero for r > R, then the curl of A is zero. But if we have a discontinuity at r = R, then there might be a surface current or something? Wait, but the problem is about the magnetic field generated by A. So for r < R, B_z = B(t) = b t, and for r > R, B_z = 0. Therefore, the magnetic field is a uniform field in the z-direction inside radius R, and zero outside. So this is similar to a solenoid with a time-varying current, but only inside radius R.\n\nNow, according to Faraday's Law, the electric field is induced by the changing B field. Let's compute ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. The time derivative of B is ∂B/∂t = b for r < R, and zero for r > R. So ∇ × E = -b for r < R, and zero for r > R.\n\nBut how does this relate to E? Let's consider the symmetry. The magnetic field is uniform in the z-direction inside r < R, and zero outside. The changing magnetic field will induce a circulating electric field. Because of the cylindrical symmetry, the electric field should be in the phi direction, and depend only on r. So we can use Ampère's Law analogy for E fields (Faraday's Law in integral form).\n\nFor a circular loop of radius r in the x-y plane (since the plate is there), the line integral of E around the loop is equal to -dΦ_B/dt.\n\nLet's compute that. For r < R:\n\nΦ_B is the magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the loop of radius r. Since B is uniform and perpendicular to the area, Φ_B = B(t) * π r². Then dΦ_B/dt = π r² * dB/dt = π r² * b. Therefore, the line integral ∮ E · dl = -dΦ_B/dt = -π r² b. But since the electric field is in the phi direction, the line integral is E(r) * 2π r. Therefore:\n\nE(r) * 2π r = -π r² b → E(r) = - (π r² b) / (2 π r) ) = - (r b)/2. So the magnitude is (b r)/2, and direction is clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the sign. But since we're asked for magnitude, it's (b r)/2. So this matches our earlier result from E = -∂A/∂t. So inside r < R, E is (b r)/2 in the phi direction (with direction depending on the sign convention, but magnitude is as such).\n\nFor r > R: The flux through the loop of radius r is Φ_B = B(t) * π R², since outside R, B is zero. Then dΦ_B/dt = π R² * b. So ∮ E · dl = - π R² b. Again, the line integral is E(r) * 2 π r, so:\n\nE(r) * 2 π r = - π R² b → E(r) = - π R² b / (2 π r) ) = - R² b / (2 r). So the magnitude is R² b / (2 r). Therefore, the electric field outside r > R is R² b / (2 r) in the phi direction.\n\nTherefore, the electric field has two components:\n\n- For r < R: E = (b r)/2 in phi direction.\n\n- For r > R: E = (b R²)/(2 r) in phi direction.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed E from -∂A/∂t, I only got the first part. But here, using Faraday's Law, I get both parts. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because when r > R, the vector potential A is zero, so ∂A/∂t is zero, but the electric field is not zero because there is a changing magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the loop. So the electric field exists even where A is zero because of the changing magnetic flux. Therefore, my initial approach using E = -∂A/∂t was incomplete. The correct approach is to use Faraday's Law, which accounts for the changing flux even in regions where A is zero. Therefore, the electric field is non-zero for both r < R and r > R.\n\nTherefore, the current density J = σ E is:\n\n- For r < R: J = σ b r / 2.\n\n- For r > R: J = σ b R² / (2 r).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: sigma*b*r / 2 (for r smaller than R), sigma*b*R^2 / (2r) (for r greater than R). That's exactly what I found. So option A?\n\nWait, let me check the other options.\n\nOption B: sigma*b*r (for r smaller than R), sigma*b*R^2 / r. That's double the first part and double the denominator in the second part? No, for r < R, it's double my result. For r > R, it's double the numerator? Wait, my result for r > R is sigma*b*R²/(2r), whereas option B has sigma*b*R² / r. So option B has double the magnitude for r > R. So option A seems correct.\n\nOption C: sigma*b*r / 2 (for r < R), sigma*b*R^3 / (2 r^2). No, different denominator.\n\nOption D: sigma*b*r²/(2R) for r < R, same as option A for r > R. So for r < R, option D is different. So according to my calculation, option A is correct. But let me check again.\n\nWait, when I did the calculation for E using Faraday's Law, I found for r < R, E = -b r / 2. So magnitude is b r / 2. Then J is sigma times that. For r > R, E is b R² / (2 r). So J is sigma times that. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check again the calculation for r > R. The flux through a loop of radius r > R is Φ = B(t) * π R². Then dΦ/dt = π R² b. The line integral of E is E * 2 π r = - dΦ/dt = - π R² b. Therefore, E = - π R² b / (2 π r) ) = - R² b / (2 r). So magnitude is R² b / (2 r). Therefore, J is sigma times that. Therefore, option A is correct. So the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other consideration. For example, the plate is conducting, so the induced current would create its own magnetic field, but since the problem asks for the current density induced due to the variation of the vector potential, we don't need to consider the self-inductance or the back-EMF, right? The question is only about the primary induced current due to the given vector potential's time variation. Therefore, our calculation is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if we had used E = -∂A/∂t, then for r < R, E = -∂A/∂t = - (d/dt)(B r / 2) = - (b r / 2). So magnitude is same as before. But for r > R, A is zero, so E would be zero. However, that contradicts the Faraday's Law result. Therefore, the correct approach is Faraday's Law because it accounts for the changing flux even in regions where A is zero. Hence, the correct current density for r > R is non-zero. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>"}
