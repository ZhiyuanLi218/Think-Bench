Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum length scales in low-dimensional systems. \n\nFirst, in a one-dimensional Bose gas, quantum fluctuations play a significant role because of the reduced dimensionality. The quantum length $ L_q $ is probably related to the healing length or some other length scale that characterizes the system's quantum behavior. The healing length, for example, is a measure of how quickly a disturbance in the density of the condensate can be \"healed\" by the system. But I'm not sure if that's exactly the same as the quantum length here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe $ L_q $ is related to the thermal de Broglie wavelength? In three dimensions, the de Broglie wavelength $ \\lambda_{th} $ is given by $ \\lambda_{th} = \\hbar / \\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_B T} $, which is a measure of the quantum coherence length at temperature T. In one dimension, perhaps the expression would be different. But I need to check if that's the case for the quantum length here.\n\nWait, the question mentions verifying it using an integral formula. So maybe the quantum length comes from some sort of integral expression in the theory of the one-dimensional Bose gas. Let me think about the models used for 1D Bose gases. The Lieb-Liniger model is a well-known model for a one-dimensional gas of bosons with delta-function interactions. The properties of this model are often studied using Bethe ansatz techniques. \n\nIn the Lieb-Liniger model, the ground state properties depend on the interaction strength, usually characterized by the dimensionless parameter $ \\gamma = \\frac{c}{n} $, where $ c $ is the interaction strength and $ n $ is the density. But how does that relate to a quantum length?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quantum length is related to the correlation length in the system. In one dimension, even at zero temperature, there is no true Bose-Einstein condensation due to strong quantum fluctuations. Instead, the system exhibits quasi-long-range order, with algebraic decay of correlations. The correlation length could be considered a quantum length scale. \n\nThe correlation length $ \\xi $ in a 1D Bose gas is given by something like $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m c} $ for the Lieb-Liniger model in the weakly interacting limit. Wait, let me recall. In the weak coupling limit (small $ \\gamma $), the Lieb-Liniger model can be mapped to a theory of non-interacting bosons with a renormalized velocity. The Luttinger liquid theory describes such systems, where the correlation functions decay as power laws with exponents depending on the interaction strength. \n\nIn Luttinger liquid theory, the correlation length might be related to the healing length. The healing length $ \\xi $ is given by $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m \\mu}} $, where $ \\mu $ is the chemical potential. But in a 1D Bose gas, the chemical potential for weak interactions can be approximated as $ \\mu \\approx c n $, so substituting that in, we get $ \\xi \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}} $. But this seems different from the previous expression I mentioned. Maybe I need to check more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in one dimension. The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is a nonlinear Schrödinger equation that describes the condensate wavefunction in the mean-field approximation. The healing length is derived from this equation. In 3D, the healing length is $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m \\mu}} $, as I mentioned. In 1D, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation would be different. Let me write it down.\n\nIn one dimension, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\frac{d^2 \\psi}{d x^2} + c |\\psi|^2 \\psi = \\mu \\psi\n$$\n\nAssuming a uniform system, the solution is $ \\psi(x) = \\sqrt{n} e^{i \\theta(x)} $, where $ n $ is the density. Plugging this into the equation gives:\n\n$$\nc n \\sqrt{n} = \\mu \\sqrt{n} \\implies \\mu = c n\n$$\n\nSo the chemical potential is $ \\mu = c n $. Now, if we consider a small perturbation to the density, the healing length is determined by the scale over which the kinetic energy and interaction energy balance. For example, consider a region where the density drops to zero. The healing length $ \\xi $ satisfies the differential equation when the kinetic term balances the interaction term. Let me consider a situation where the density varies slowly, so we can approximate the second derivative. Suppose we have a step-like change in density, then the healing length is found by balancing the terms in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\psi}{d x^2} = \\frac{2 m}{\\hbar^2} (\\mu - c |\\psi|^2) \\psi\n$$\n\nIn the case where the density is changing from zero to $ n $, we can consider the region where $ |\\psi|^2 $ goes from 0 to $ n $. Let me assume that the density varies as $ |\\psi(x)|^2 = n (1 - e^{-x/\\xi}) $ or something similar. But maybe a better approach is to consider a linearized version. Suppose that the deviation from the uniform density is small. Let me write $ \\psi(x) = \\sqrt{n + \\delta n(x)} $. Then expanding the equation to linear order in $ \\delta n $. However, this might be getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, consider the healing length as the inverse of the square root of the coefficient in front of the $ |\\psi|^2 \\psi $ term. In the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, the healing length is typically $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m \\mu}} $. Since we found that $ \\mu = c n $, substituting gives:\n\n$$\n\\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}}\n$$\n\nSo this is the healing length in 1D. But is this the quantum length $ L_q $? Maybe. However, the question mentions verifying it using an integral formula. Perhaps the quantum length is derived from an integral expression in the theory of the 1D Bose gas.\n\nLet me recall that in some derivations, the quantum length might come from the integral over the momentum distribution or something related to the scattering. Alternatively, in the context of the Lieb-Liniger model, there are exact expressions for the ground state energy and other quantities, which might involve integrals.\n\nAlternatively, considering the thermal de Broglie wavelength in one dimension. In 1D, the thermal de Broglie wavelength is given by $ \\lambda_{th} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_B T}} $, similar to 3D but with the factor adjusted for dimensionality. However, this is a thermal length scale. The question is about a quantum length, which might be a zero-temperature concept.\n\nWait, the problem says \"quantum length\", so maybe it's a length scale that characterizes quantum effects, regardless of temperature. In a one-dimensional Bose gas, at zero temperature, the quantum fluctuations are significant, and the system is described by Luttinger liquid theory. In that case, the correlation length is determined by the interaction strength and density.\n\nAlternatively, considering the quantum depletion of the condensate. In 1D, the quantum depletion is significant even at zero temperature because of the divergent phase fluctuations. However, calculating the quantum depletion would involve integrals over the Bogoliubov spectrum.\n\nLet me try to think about the Bogoliubov approach for the 1D Bose gas. In the Bogoliubov theory, the excitation spectrum is given by $ \\epsilon_k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^4 k^4}{4 m^2} + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2 c n}{m}} $, where $ c $ is the interaction strength. Simplifying, this becomes $ \\epsilon_k = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{2 m} \\sqrt{k^2 + \\frac{4 m c n}{\\hbar^2}} $. In the long wavelength limit ( $ k \\to 0 $ ), the spectrum becomes linear: $ \\epsilon_k \\approx c \\hbar k $, where $ c = \\sqrt{\\frac{c n}{m}} $ is the speed of sound in the gas. \n\nThe quantum depletion $ \\delta n $ is given by the sum over all momenta of the occupation of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. In three dimensions, this is typically small, but in one dimension, it might be more significant. However, calculating the depletion would involve an integral over $ k $, and perhaps this integral leads to a characteristic length scale.\n\nThe quantum depletion is given by:\n\n$$\n\\delta n = \\int \\frac{d k}{2 \\pi} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m \\epsilon_k} - 1 \\right)\n$$\n\nWait, I need to recall the exact expression for quantum depletion. In Bogoliubov theory, the depletion is given by the sum over the occupation of the Bogoliubov modes. The depletion $ \\delta n $ is:\n\n$$\n\\delta n = \\sum_{k \\neq 0} \\langle b_k^\\dagger b_k \\rangle = \\sum_{k \\neq 0} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m \\epsilon_k} - 1 \\right)\n$$\n\nBut since we are in one dimension, the sum becomes an integral over $ k $, with appropriate factors. Let me write this as:\n\n$$\n\\delta n = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d k}{2 \\pi} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m \\epsilon_k} - 1 \\right)\n$$\n\nBut this integral might diverge in 1D. Let me check. For large $ k $, the Bogoliubov dispersion becomes $ \\epsilon_k \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m} $, so the term $ \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m \\epsilon_k} $ approaches 1, and the whole expression becomes $ \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0 $. Therefore, the integral might converge. However, in 1D, even though the integral converges, the depletion might still be significant.\n\nBut how does this relate to the quantum length $ L_q $? Maybe the integral defines a length scale. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is related to the healing length or another length scale.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quantum length is defined as the inverse of the square root of the density, or something similar. Let me think again.\n\nThe question asks to derive the expression for $ L_q $ and verify it using an integral formula. Let me check literature or standard derivations. Wait, since I can't actually look things up, I need to reconstruct.\n\nIn the theory of one-dimensional Bose gases, the quantum length is sometimes defined as the length scale at which quantum fluctuations become important. For example, when the average interparticle distance $ n^{-1} $ becomes comparable to the healing length $ \\xi $, quantum fluctuations are significant. \n\nBut if the healing length is $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}} $, then perhaps the quantum length is proportional to this. However, I need to derive it.\n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, the quantum length is given by $ L_q = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{m c}} $. Let me see. If we take the healing length $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}} $, then $ L_q $ might be defined as $ \\xi \\sqrt{n} $, but that would have dimensions of inverse square root of density? Wait, no, let me check the dimensions.\n\nLet me do dimensional analysis. Let me recall that in SI units, the interaction strength $ c $ has units of energy × length, since in the 1D delta function interaction $ H = g \\int dx \\, \\psi^\\dagger(x) \\psi^\\dagger(x') \\psi(x') \\psi(x) \\delta(x - x') $, so the coupling constant $ g $ (which is related to $ c $) has units of energy × length. Therefore, $ c $ has units of energy × length. Let me confirm: In 1D, the interaction term is $ c \\int dx \\, \\psi^\\dagger(x) \\psi^\\dagger(x) \\psi(x) \\psi(x) $, so the dimension of $ c $ must be energy × length, since the integral of the density squared over length must have units of energy. So if the density has units of [length]^{-1}, then $ |\\psi|^4 $ has units [length]^{-4}, multiplied by $ c $ and integrated over length, so $ c \\times [length]^{-4} \\times [length] = c \\times [length]^{-3} $ must have units of energy. Therefore, $ c $ has units of energy × [length]^3? Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian must have units of energy. The interaction term is $ c \\int dx \\, \\psi^\\dagger(x) \\psi^\\dagger(x) \\psi(x) \\psi(x) $. The wavefunction $ \\psi(x) $ in second quantization has units of [length]^{-1/2} because the particle density is $ \\psi^\\dagger(x) \\psi(x) $, which has units of [length]^{-1}. Therefore, $ |\\psi|^4 $ has units [length]^{-2}. Integrating over x (units of length) gives [length]^{-1}. Therefore, multiplying by $ c $, which must have units of energy × [length] to make the whole term have units of energy. Therefore, $ c $ has units of energy × length. \n\nSo, with that in mind, let's check the healing length expression. Let me write the healing length $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}} $. Let's check the units inside the square root:\n\n$ m $ is mass, $ c $ is energy × length, $ n $ is [length]^{-1}.\n\nSo $ m c n $ has units of mass × (energy × length) × [length]^{-1} ) = mass × energy. But energy is mass × length² / time². Therefore, mass × energy is mass² × length² / time². Taking square root gives mass × length / time, which is momentum. Then $ \\hbar $ has units of energy × time = mass × length² / time. Therefore, $ \\hbar / \\sqrt{m c n} $ has units (mass × length² / time) / (mass × length / time)) = length. So yes, the units check out. So $ \\xi $ has units of length, which is correct.\n\nBut is this the quantum length? Maybe. However, I need to derive it. Let me think of a derivation.\n\nStarting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 1D:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\frac{d^2 \\psi}{d x^2} + c |\\psi|^2 \\psi = \\mu \\psi\n$$\n\nLet me consider a situation where the density varies in space. For example, consider a region where the density goes from zero to some value. In such a case, the healing length is the scale over which the density adjusts to the equilibrium value. Let me consider a simple case where the density is zero for $ x < 0 $ and $ n $ for $ x > 0 $. The wavefunction would then go from zero to $ \\sqrt{n} $. The differential equation in this region can be approximated by neglecting the kinetic energy term? No, actually, we need to solve the equation.\n\nLet me assume a solution of the form $ \\psi(x) = \\sqrt{n} f(x/\\xi) $, where $ f $ is a dimensionless function that goes from 0 to 1 as $ x $ goes from $ -\\infty $ to $ +\\infty $. Let me plug this into the GP equation.\n\nFirst, compute the second derivative:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\psi}{d x^2} = \\sqrt{n} \\frac{d^2 f}{d (x/\\xi)^2} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{\\xi^2} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe GP equation becomes:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\sqrt{n} \\frac{1}{\\xi^2} \\frac{d^2 f}{d (x/\\xi)^2} + c n \\sqrt{n} f^2 = \\mu \\sqrt{n} f\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by $ \\sqrt{n} $:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m \\xi^2} \\frac{d^2 f}{d (x/\\xi)^2} + c n f^2 = \\mu f\n$$\n\nNow, using the fact that in the uniform case, $ \\mu = c n $. Therefore, substituting $ \\mu = c n $, we get:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m \\xi^2} \\frac{d^2 f}{d (x/\\xi)^2} + c n (f^2 - f) = 0\n$$\n\nTo make this equation dimensionless and find $ \\xi $, we need to balance the terms. The first term involves the second derivative of $ f $, which is a dimensionless function varying over the length scale $ \\xi $. The second term is proportional to $ c n (f^2 - f) $. For these terms to balance, the coefficients should be of the same order. Therefore, equating the coefficients:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m \\xi^2} \\sim c n\n$$\n\nSolving for $ \\xi $:\n\n$$\n\\xi \\sim \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}}\n$$\n\nWhich gives the healing length. Therefore, this derivation shows that the healing length is $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}} $. If this is the quantum length $ L_q $, then this would be the expression. However, the problem mentions verifying it using an integral formula. So perhaps there's another way to derive this expression by evaluating an integral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quantum length comes from the integral expression for the ground state energy or some other quantity. Let me think about the ground state energy of the 1D Bose gas. In the Lieb-Liniger model, the exact ground state energy per particle is given by an integral equation, but that might be too complex. In the Bogoliubov approximation, the ground state energy is:\n\n$$\nE = E_0 + \\sum_{k} \\epsilon_k\n$$\n\nWhere $ E_0 $ is the mean-field energy, and the sum is over the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. However, in the ground state, there are no quasiparticles, so maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, the quantum depletion is given by an integral, and if we relate that to a length scale...\n\nAlternatively, considering the static structure factor or the momentum distribution. The momentum distribution $ n(k) $ in 1D is related to the Fourier transform of the density-density correlation function. In the Luttinger liquid theory, the momentum distribution has a power-law divergence at $ k = 0 $, but for finite $ k $, it decays as $ k^{-\\alpha} $. The integral of the momentum distribution is related to the density, but I'm not sure how that gives a length scale.\n\nWait, the integral of the momentum distribution over all $ k $ gives the total number of particles? No, actually, in second quantization, the momentum distribution is $ n(k) = \\langle \\psi^\\dagger(k) \\psi(k) \\rangle $, and integrating over $ k $ gives the total number of particles. But since we are dealing with a uniform system, this would just give $ N $, the total number of particles. Not helpful for a length scale.\n\nAlternatively, considering the integral of the correlation function. The density-density correlation function in a 1D Bose gas decays as $ \\langle \\delta \\rho(x) \\delta \\rho(0) \\rangle \\sim \\frac{1}{x^{2 K}} $, where $ K $ is the Luttinger parameter. For the Lieb-Liniger model, $ K $ depends on the interaction strength. The correlation length is related to the exponential decay of correlations, but in 1D, the decay is algebraic, so there is no finite correlation length. However, in the presence of impurities or at finite temperatures, there might be an exponential decay with a finite correlation length. \n\nBut the question is about the quantum length, which is probably a zero-temperature concept. Maybe the quantum length is related to the healing length derived earlier. If that is the case, then the expression is $ L_q = \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}} $. However, the problem says to verify it using an integral formula. Maybe there's an integral expression for the healing length or the quantum length.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in the derivation of the healing length, we balanced the kinetic and interaction terms in the GP equation. This is a local consideration, but maybe there's a global integral that defines this length scale. For example, consider the energy of a domain wall or a kink in the density profile. The energy cost of creating such a domain wall would involve an integral of the energy density over space. \n\nLet me consider a domain wall solution where the density goes from 0 to $ n $ over a length $ L_q $. The energy associated with this domain wall would be the integral of the kinetic energy and the interaction energy. Let me approximate this. \n\nAssume a simple profile for the wavefunction: $ \\psi(x) = \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\frac{x}{L_q} $ for $ -L_q/2 < x < L_q/2 $, and zero outside. This is a crude approximation, but let's use it for estimation. The kinetic energy is:\n\n$$\nE_{kin} = \\int dx \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} |\\nabla \\psi|^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\int dx \\left| \\frac{d}{dx} \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\frac{x}{L_q} \\right|^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\int dx \\left( \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{L_q} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\cdot \\frac{n}{L_q^2} \\cdot L_q = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\cdot \\frac{n}{L_q}\n$$\n\nThe interaction energy is:\n\n$$\nE_{int} = \\int dx \\frac{c}{2} |\\psi|^4 = \\frac{c}{2} \\int dx n^2 \\left( \\frac{x}{L_q} \\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\cdot \\frac{L_q^3}{3 L_q^2} } = \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\cdot \\frac{L_q}{3}\n$$\n\nWait, let me redo the integral. If $ \\psi(x) = \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\frac{x}{L_q} $, then $ |\\psi|^4 = n^2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{x}{L_q} \\right)^4 $. Integrating over $ x $ from $ -L_q/2 $ to $ L_q/2 $:\n\n$$\nE_{int} = \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\int_{-L_q/2}^{L_q/2} dx \\left( \\frac{x}{L_q} \\right)^4 = \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{L_q^4} \\cdot \\int_{-L_q/2}^{L_q/2} x^4 dx\n$$\n\nThe integral of $ x^4 $ from $ -a $ to $ a $ is $ 2 \\cdot \\frac{a^5}{5} $. Therefore:\n\n$$\nE_{int} = \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{L_q^4} \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{(L_q/2)^5}{5} = \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{L_q^4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{L_q^5}{32} } = \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\cdot \\frac{L_q}{80}\n$$\n\nWait, let me compute that again. \n\nThe integral $ \\int_{-L_q/2}^{L_q/2} x^4 dx = 2 \\cdot \\int_{0}^{L_q/2} x^4 dx = 2 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{x^5}{5} \\right]_0^{L_q/2} } = 2 \\cdot \\frac{(L_q/2)^5}{5} = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{L_q^5}{32} } = \\frac{L_q^5}{80} $.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\nE_{int} = \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{L_q^4} \\cdot \\frac{L_q^5}{80} } = \\frac{c}{2} n^2 \\cdot \\frac{L_q}{80} = \\frac{c n^2 L_q}{160}\n$$\n\nNow, the total energy is $ E = E_{kin} + E_{int} $. To find the optimal $ L_q $, we minimize the energy with respect to $ L_q $:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{d L_q} = - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\cdot \\frac{n}{L_q^2} + \\frac{c n^2}{160} = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for $ L_q $:\n\n$$\n\\frac{c n^2}{160} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\cdot \\frac{n}{L_q^2} \\implies L_q^2 = \\frac{160 \\hbar^2}{2 m c n} \\implies L_q = \\sqrt{ \\frac{80 \\hbar^2}{m c n} } = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{m c n}} \\cdot \\sqrt{80}\n$$\n\nHmm, this gives a different coefficient than the healing length expression $ \\xi = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}} $. The coefficient here is $ \\sqrt{80} \\approx 8.94 $ times larger. This discrepancy is likely due to the crude approximation of the wavefunction profile. In reality, the profile is not linear but something like a hyperbolic tangent or another function that smoothly interpolates between 0 and $ n $. However, the important thing is that the dependence on $ \\hbar $, $ m $, $ c $, and $ n $ is the same, which suggests that the healing length is indeed proportional to $ \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{m c n}} $. The coefficient might differ based on the specific profile assumed.\n\nTherefore, this integral approach, albeit with an approximate profile, gives an expression for $ L_q $ that has the same functional dependence as the healing length. This might be the verification the question refers to. So, combining the dimensional analysis and the variational approach with an integral, we can derive the expression for the quantum length.\n\nAlternatively, if the question refers to a specific integral formula in the literature, maybe from the exact solution of the Lieb-Liniger model or another approach. However, given the information I have, the healing length seems like the most plausible candidate for the quantum length in a 1D Bose gas, and it can be derived and verified using the integral approach I outlined.\n\nTo summarize, the quantum length $ L_q $ is the healing length in a one-dimensional Bose gas, given by:\n\n$$\nL_q = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}}\n$$\n\nThis was derived by balancing the kinetic and interaction terms in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and verified by considering the energy of a domain wall with an approximate wavefunction profile, minimizing the energy with respect to the length scale $ L_q $, and finding the same dependence on the parameters.\n\nTherefore, the expression for the quantum length $ L_q $ is $ \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}} $, and this has been verified using an integral approach involving energy minimization.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe quantum length in a one-dimensional Bose gas is given by \\boxed{L_{\\mathrm{q}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m c n}}}.\n</think>"}
