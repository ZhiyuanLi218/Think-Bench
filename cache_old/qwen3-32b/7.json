The problem says they form an ideal solution, which probably means I can use Raoult's Law here. Let me recall what Raoult's Law is. From what I remember, it states that the partial vapor pressure of each component in the solution is proportional to its mole fraction and the vapor pressure of the pure component. So, the formula should be something like P_A = X_A * P_A°, where P_A is the partial pressure of A, X_A is the mole fraction of A, and P_A° is the vapor pressure of pure A. Then, the total vapor pressure of the mixture would be the sum of the partial pressures of all components.\n\nAlright, the problem gives me the vapor pressure of pure A as 345 torr and pure B as 213 torr. The mole fraction of A in the mixture is 0.285. Since there are only two components, the mole fraction of B should be 1 - 0.285, which is 0.715. Let me confirm that: 1 - 0.285 equals 0.715. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo applying Raoult's Law to each component. For solvent A: P_A = 0.285 * 345 torr. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 0.285 times 345. Hmm. Let me break it down. 0.285 is the same as 285/1000. Maybe I can do 345 * 0.285. Let me compute that step by step. 345 * 0.2 is 69, 345 * 0.08 is 27.6, and 345 * 0.005 is 1.725. Adding those together: 69 + 27.6 is 96.6, plus 1.725 is 98.325 torr. So the partial pressure of A is approximately 98.325 torr.\n\nNow for solvent B: P_B = 0.715 * 213 torr. Let me calculate that. Again, breaking it down. 0.7 * 213 is 149.1, and 0.015 * 213 is 3.195. So adding those together: 149.1 + 3.195 = 152.295 torr. Wait, but hold on, the mole fraction of B is 0.715, so maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me check that calculation again. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me do 0.715 * 213. Let me write 213 * 0.7 = 149.1, 213 * 0.015 = 3.195. So total is 149.1 + 3.195 = 152.295 torr. So the partial pressure of B is approximately 152.295 torr.\n\nThen the total vapor pressure of the mixture should be P_total = P_A + P_B = 98.325 + 152.295. Let me add those numbers. 98.325 + 152.295. Adding the decimal parts first: 0.325 + 0.295 = 0.62. Then 98 + 152 = 250. So total is 250 + 0.62 = 250.62 torr. Rounding to the nearest whole number, since the given vapor pressures are whole numbers, the answer should be approximately 251 torr. Let me check if that matches any of the options given. The options are A:213, B:345, C:568, D:251. Yes, option D is 251 torr. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the partial pressures. For A: 0.285 * 345. Let me use another method. 345 * 0.285. Let me convert 0.285 to a fraction. 0.285 is approximately 285/1000, which simplifies to 57/200. So 345 * 57 / 200. Let me compute 345 * 57 first. 345 * 50 = 17,250. 345 * 7 = 2,415. So total is 17,250 + 2,415 = 19,665. Then divide by 200: 19,665 / 200 = 98.325. So that's correct. For B: 0.715 * 213. Let me do 0.7 * 213 = 149.1, 0.015 * 213 = 3.195. Total 152.295. Adding them gives 98.325 + 152.295. Let me do 98 + 152 is 250, 0.325 + 0.295 is 0.62, so total 250.62. So 250.62 torr, which rounds to 251. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I used the correct formula. Since it's an ideal solution, the total vapor pressure is indeed the sum of the partial pressures. Yes, that's right. Each component contributes its own partial pressure based on mole fraction and pure vapor pressure, and they add up. So the answer should be D:251 torr. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify once more with another approach. Let me compute the total vapor pressure using the formula:\n\nP_total = X_A * P_A° + X_B * P_B°\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. Since X_A is 0.285, X_B is 0.715. So plugging in the numbers, that gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D:251 torr.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>"}
